'''Conorfone''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]; '''TR-5109'''), also known as '''conorphone''' and '''codorphone''', as well as '''conorphone hydrochloride''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]), is an [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] that was never marketed.<ref name="Macdonald1997">{{cite book | author = F..

Exposure of thebaine ('''1''') to mild acid leads to hydrolysis of the enol ether function followed by migration of the double bond to yield the conjugated enone ('''2'''). Addition of lithium diethylcuprate proceeds by 1,4-addition from the less hindered side to give the intermediate '''3'''. Treatment of that with [[cyanogen bromide]] under [[von Braun reaction]] conditions leads to the isolable aminocyanide. This is the converted to the secondary amine ('''4''') by treatment with aqueous base. Alkylation of that intermediate with [[cyclopropylmethyl chloride]]<ref>{{US patent|6118032}}</ref><ref>{{US patent|6077981}}</ref> affords the analgesic codorphone ('''5''').
