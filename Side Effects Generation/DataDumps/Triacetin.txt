The [[triglyceride]] '''1,2,3-triacetoxypropane''' is more generally known as '''triacetin''' and '''glycerin triacetate'''. It is the [[ester|triester]] of [[glycerol]] and acetylating agents, such as [[acetic acid]] and [[acetic anhydride]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kong | first1 = P. S. | last2 = Aroua | first2 = M.

==Uses==
It is an artificial chemical compound,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://texas-chem.com/products/kosher-certified-materials/2-uncategorised/99-triacetin|title = Triacetin|website = texas-chem.com|accessdate = 2014-06-20|publisher = Chemical and Filtration Products of Texas}}</ref> commonly used as a [[food additive]], for instance as a [[solvent]] in [[flavouring]]s, and for its [[humectant]] function, with [[E number]] '''E1518''' and Australian approval code A1518.  It is used as an [[excipient]] in pharmaceutical products, where it is used as a humectant, a [[plasticizer]], and as a solvent.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://drugtopics.modernmedicine.com/drugtopics/Drugtopics.com+Exclusives/Overview-of-pharmaceutical-excipients-used-in-tabl/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/561047|title = Triacetin|website=drugtopics.modernmedicine.com|accessdate = 2014-06-20|publisher = Advanstar Communications, Inc.}}</ref>

Triacetin can also be used as a [[fuel additive]] as an [[antiknock agent]] which can reduce [[engine knocking]] in [[gasoline]], and to improve cold and [[viscosity]] properties of [[biodiesel]].<ref>Gupta, Mayank; Kumar, Naveen "Scope and opportunities of using glycerol as an energy source" Renewable & Sustainable Energy Reviews (2012), 16(7), 4551-4556. {{DOI|10.1016/j.rser.2012.04.001}}</ref>

In a 1994 report released by five top [[cigarette]] companies, triacetin was listed as one of the 599 [[cigarette additive]]s. The triacetin is applied to the filter as a [[plasticizer]].<ref>{{cite patent|US|6145511}}</ref>

It has been considered as a possible source of [[food energy]] in artificial food regeneration systems on long [[space mission]]s. It is believed to be safe to get over half of one's dietary energy from triacetin.<ref>{{cite web|first = Jacob|last = Shapira|first2 = Adrian D.|last2 = Mandel|first3 = Phillip D.|last3 = Quattrone|first4 = Nancie L.|last4 = Bell|year = 1968|title = Current Research On Regenerative Systems|publisher = Committee On Space Research, Eleventh Annual Meeting|place = Tokyo|url = https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19680025022_1968025022.pdf| website=casi.ntrs.nasa.gov|accessdate = 2014-06-20}}</ref>

==Safety==
The [[US Food and Drug Administration]] has approved it as [[Generally Recognized as Safe]] ([http://www.fda.gov/food/ingredientspackaginglabeling/gras/scogs/ucm260418.htm GRAS]) food additive and included it in the database according to the opinion from the Select Committee On GRAS Substances (SCOGS). 
:"''Three types of acetostearins have been found to be without toxic effects in long-term feeding tests in rats at levels up to 5 g per kg per day. This contrasts with an estimated human consumption of a fraction of a milligram per kg per day. It is recognized that at an even higher feeding level (10 g per kg per day) male rats developed testicular atrophy and female rats, uterine discoloration. However, such a level which would amount to 50 g or more for an infant and 600 g for an adult per day, is vastly higher than would be possible in the consumption of foods to which acetostearins are added for functional purposes.''" 
Triacetin is included in the SCOGS database since 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/fcn/fcnDetailNavigation.cfm?rpt=scogslisting&id=142|website = www.fda.gov|title = Glycerin and Glycerides|place = U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate = 2014-06-20}}</ref>

Triacetin was not toxic to animals in studies of exposure through repeated inhalation over a relatively short period.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 14555416 | volume=22 Suppl 2 | title=Final report on the safety assessment of triacetin. | year=2003 | journal=Int J Toxicol | pages=1–10 | doi=10.1080/747398359}}</ref>
