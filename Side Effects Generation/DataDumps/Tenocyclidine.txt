'''Tenocyclidine''' ('''TCP''') was discovered by a team at [[Parke Davis]] in the late 1950s.<ref>{{US patent|2921076}} Heterocyclic compounds and methods for producing the same</ref> It is a [[dissociative]] [[anesthesia|anesthetic]] [[drug]] with [[psychostimulant]] and [[hallucinogen]]ic effects. It is similar in effects to [[phencyclidine]] (PCP) but is considerably more potent. TCP has slightly different binding properties to PCP, with more affinity for the [[NMDA receptor]]s,<ref>Stirling JM, Cross AJ, Green AR. The binding of [3H]thienyl cyclohexylpiperidine ([3H]TCP) to the NMDA-phencyclidine receptor complex. Neuropharmacology. 1989 Jan;28(1):1-7.</ref> but less affinity for the [[sigma receptor]]s.<ref>Javitt DC, Jotkowitz A, Sircar R, Zukin SR. Non-competitive regulation of phencyclidine/sigma-receptors by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist D-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid. Neuroscience Letters. 1987 Jul 22;78(2):193-8.</ref> Because of its high affinity for the PCP site of the NMDA receptor complex, the <sup>3</sup>H [[Isotopic labeling|radiolabelled]] form of TCP is widely used in research into NMDA receptors.

TCP acts primarily as an [[NMDA receptor antagonist]] which blocks the activity of the NMDA receptor, however its increased psychostimulant effects compared to PCP suggests it also has relatively greater activity as a [[dopamine reuptake inhibitor]] (DRI). Due to its similarity in effects to PCP, TCP was placed into the [[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Drugs and Poisons|Schedule I]] list of illegal drugs in the 1970s, although it was only briefly used in the 1970s and 1980s and is now little known.
