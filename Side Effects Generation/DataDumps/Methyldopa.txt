=== Rebound/withdrawal ===
[[Rebound effect|Rebound]] [[hypertension]] via [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] on account of [[drug tolerance|tolerance]] upon the abrupt [[discontinuation]] of methyldopa has been reported.<ref>[http://www.inchem.org/documents/pims/pharm/methyldo.htm Methyldopa (PIM 342)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313130358/http://www.inchem.org/documents/pims/pharm/methyldo.htm |date=2008-03-13 }}</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==
Methyldopa has a dual [[mechanism of action]]:

* It is a competitive inhibitor of the [[enzyme]] [[DOPA decarboxylase]], also known as [[aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase|aromatic <small>L</small>-amino acid decarboxylase]], which converts [[L-DOPA|<small>L</small>-DOPA]] into [[dopamine]]. Dopamine is a precursor for [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline) and subsequently [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline). This inhibition results in reduced [[dopaminergic]] and [[adrenergic]] [[neurotransmission]] in the [[peripheral nervous system]].  This effect may lower blood pressure and cause [[central nervous system]] effects such as [[clinical depression|depression]], [[anxiety]], [[apathy]], [[anhedonia]], and [[parkinsonism]]. In addition, decreased dopamine may reduce its inhibitory effect on prolactin leading to signs and symptoms of [[hyperprolactinemia]].
* It is converted to [[α-methylnorepinephrine]] by [[dopamine beta hydroxylase|dopamine beta-hydroxylase]] (DBH). α-methylnorepinephrine is an [[agonist]] of presynaptic central nervous system α<sub>2</sub> adrenergic [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]]. Activation of these receptors in the brainstem appears to inhibit [[sympathetic nervous system]] output and lower blood pressure. This is also the mechanism of action of [[clonidine]].

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Methyldopa exhibits variable [[Absorption (pharmacokinetics)|absorption]] from the [[gastrointestinal tract]]. It is [[metabolism|metabolized]] in the [[liver]] and [[intestine]]s and is [[excretion|excreted]] in [[urine]].

== History ==
When methyldopa was first introduced, it was the mainstay of antihypertensive [[therapy|treatment]], but its use has declined on account of relatively severe adverse side effects, with increased use of other safer and more tolerable agents such as [[alpha blocker]]s, [[beta blocker]]s, and [[calcium channel blocker]]s. Additionally, it has yet to be associated with reducing adverse cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction and stroke, or overall all-cause mortality reduction in clinical trials.<ref>Mah GT, Tejani AM, Musini VM. Methyldopa for primary hypertension. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2009, Issue 4. Art. No.: CD003893. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003893.pub3.</ref> Nonetheless, one of methyldopa's still current indications is in the management of [[pregnancy-induced hypertension]] (PIH), as it is relatively safe in [[pregnancy]] compared to many other antihypertensives which may affect the [[fetus]].

== See also ==
* [[Difluoromethyldopa]]
* [[D-DOPA|<small>D</small>-DOPA]] (dextrodopa)
* [[L-DOPA|<small>L</small>-DOPA]] (levodopa; trade names Sinemet, Parcopa, Atamet, Stalevo, Madopar, Prolopa, etc.)
* [[Droxidopa|<small>L</small>-DOPS]] (droxidopa)
* [[Dopamine]] (Intropan, Inovan, Revivan, Rivimine, Dopastat, Dynatra, etc.)
* [[Norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline; Levophed, etc.)
* [[Epinephrine]] (adrenaline; Adrenalin, EpiPed, Twinject, etc.)
