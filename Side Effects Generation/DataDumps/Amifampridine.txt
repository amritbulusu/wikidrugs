'''Amifampridine''' ('''pyridine-3,4-diamine''', '''3,4-diaminopyridine''', '''3,4-DAP''')  is used as a drug, predominantly in the treatment of a number of rare muscle diseases. The [[free base]] form of the drug has been used to treat [[congenital myasthenic syndrome]]s and [[Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome]] (LEMS) through [[expanded access|compassionate use programs]] since the 1990s and was recommended as a first line treatment for LEMS in 2006, using ''ad hoc'' forms of the drug, since there was no marketed form.

Around 2000 doctors at [[Assistance Publique – Hôpitaux de Paris]] created a phosphate [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] form, which was developed through a series of companies ending with [[BioMarin Pharmaceutical]] which obtained European approval in 2009 under the trade name '''Firdapse''', and which licensed the US rights to [[Catalyst Pharmaceuticals]] in 2012.   As of January 2017, Catalyst and another US company, Jacobus Pharmaceuticals, which had been manufacturing the free base form and giving it away for free since the 1990s, were racing to obtain FDA approval for their versions first; the company that obtained the approval would have seven years of marketing exclusivity.

Amifampridine phosphate has [[orphan drug]] status in the EU for Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome and Catalyst holds both an orphan designation and a [[breakthrough therapy]] designation in the US.

== Medical uses ==
Amifampridine is used to treat many of the [[congenital myasthenic syndrome]]s, particularly those with defects in [[choline acetyltransferase]], [[Dok-7|downstream kinase 7]], and those where any kind of defect causes "fast channel" behaviour of the [[acetylcholine receptor]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Argov Z | title = Management of myasthenic conditions: nonimmune issues | journal = Current Opinion in Neurology | volume = 22 | issue = 5 | pages = 493–7 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19593127 | doi = 10.1097/WCO.0b013e32832f15fa }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Abicht|first1=Angela|last2=Müller|first2=Juliane|last3=Lochmüller|first3=Hanns|title=Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1168/ |website=GeneReviews|publisher=University of Washington, Seattle|date=July 14, 2016}}</ref>

== Contraindications ==
Because it affects voltage-gated ion channels, it is contraindicated in people with [[long QT syndrome]] and in people taking a drug that might prolong QT like  [[sultopride]], [[disopyramide]], [[cisapride]], [[domperidone]], [[rifampicin]] or [[ketoconazol]]. It is also contraindicated in people with [[epilepsy]] or badly controlled [[asthma]].<ref name=EMAlabel2010/>

== Adverse effects ==
The dose-limiting side effects include [[paresthesia|tingling or numbness]], difficulty sleeping, fatigue, and loss of muscle strength.<ref name=Tarr2015rev/>

Interactions via the liver's [[cytochrome P450]] enzyme system are considered unlikely.<ref name=EMAlabel2010/>

== Pharmacology ==

=== Mechanism of action ===
In Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome, [[acetylcholine]] release is inhibited as antibodies involved in the host response against certain cancers cross-react with [[voltage dependent calcium channel|Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels]] on the prejunctional membrane. Amifampridine works by blocking [[potassium channel]] efflux in nerve terminals so that action potential duration is increased.<ref name="kirsch narahashi 1978">{{cite journal|journal=Biophys J|title=3,4-diaminopyridine.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
[[File:Acetylamifampridine skeletal.svg|''N''-(4-Amino-3-pyridinyl)acetamide or 3-''N''-acetylamifampridine, the [[metabolite]]|thumb]]
Amifampridine is quickly and almost completely (93–100%) absorbed from the gut. In a study with 91 healthy subjects, maximum amifampridine concentrations in [[blood plasma]] were reached after 0.6 (±0.25) hours when taken without food, or after 1.3 (±0.9) hours after a fatty meal, meaning that the speed of absorption varies widely. [[Biological half-life]] (2.5±0.7&nbsp;hrs) and the [[area under the curve (pharmacokinetics)|area under the curve]] (AUC = 117±77&nbsp;ng∙h/ml) also vary widely between subjects, but are nearly independent of food intake.<ref name=EMAlabel2010/>

The substance is deactivated by [[acetylation]] via [[N-acetyltransferase]]s to the single [[metabolite]] 3-''N''-acetylamifampridine. Activity of these enzymes (primarily [[N-acetyltransferase 2]]) in different individuals seems to be primarily responsible for the mentioned differences in half-life and AUC: the latter is increased up to 9-fold in slow metabolizers as compared to fast metabolizers.<ref name=EMAlabel2010/>

Amifampridine is eliminated via the kidneys and urine to 74–81% as ''N''-acetylamifampridine and to 19% in unchanged form.<ref name=EMAlabel2010/>

== Chemistry ==
3,4-Diaminopyridine is a pale yellow to pale brown crystalline powder that melts at about {{convert|218|-|220|C}} under decomposition. It is readily soluble in [[methanol]], [[ethanol]] and hot water, but only slightly in [[diethyl ether]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/98n0182/nom007b.pdf|title=Diaminopyridine (3,4-)|publisher=FDA|access-date=28 November 2015}}.

==History==
3,4-DAP was discovered in Scotland in the 1970s, and doctors in Sweden first showed its use in LEMS in the 1980s.<ref name=BillHealth2016>{{cite news|last1=Deak|first1=Dalia|title=Jacobus and Catalyst Continue to Race for Approval of LEMS Drug|url=http://blogs.harvard.edu/billofhealth/2016/02/22/jacobus-and-catalyst-approval/|work=Bill of Health|date=February 22, 2016}}</ref>

In the 1990s, doctors in the US, on behalf of [[Muscular Dystrophy Association]], approached a small family-owned manufacturer of [[active pharmaceutical ingredients]] in New Jersey, Jacobus Pharmaceuticals, about manufacturing amifampridine so they could test it in clinical trials.  Jacobus did so, and when the treatment turned out to be effective, Jacobus and the doctors were faced with a choice — invest in clinical trials to get FDA approval or give the drug away for free under a [[expanded access|compassionate use program]].  Jacobus elected to give the drug away, and did so for about twenty years.<ref name=Stat2016>{{cite news|last1=Silverman|first1=Ed|title=A family-run drug maker tries to stay afloat in the Shkreli era|url=https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2016/04/05/jacobus-pharmaceuticals-martin-shkreli/|work=STAT News|date=5 April 2016}}</ref><ref name=DrugR&D2015>{{cite news|title=Jacobus Pharmaceuticals|url=https://yixiblog.wordpress.com/tag/jacobus-pharmaceuticals/|work=Drug R&D Insight|date=April 25, 2015}}</ref>

The licensing of Firdapse in 2010 in Europe led to a sharp increase in price for the drug. In some cases, this has led to hospitals using an unlicensed form rather than the licensed agent, as the price difference proved prohibitive. BioMarin has been criticized for licensing the drug on the basis of previously conducted research, and yet charging exorbitantly for it.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Goldberg|first1=Adrian|title=Drug firms accused of exploiting loophole for profit|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/health-11798183|work=BBC News|date=21 November 2010}}</ref>  A group of UK neurologists and pediatricians petitioned to prime minister [[David Cameron]] in an open letter to review the situation.<ref name=Nichol>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nicholl DJ, Hilton-Jones D, Palace J, Richmond S, Finlayson S, Winer J, Weir A, Maddison P, Fletcher N, Sussman J, Silver N, Nixon J, Kullmann D, Embleton N, Beeson D, Farrugia ME, Hill M, McDermott C, Llewelyn G, Leonard J, Morris M | title = Open letter to prime minister David Cameron and health secretary Andrew Lansley | journal = BMJ | volume = 341 | issue =  | pages = c6466 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21081599 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.c6466 | url = http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c6466.full }}</ref> The company responded that it submitted the licensing request at the suggestion of the French government, and points out that the increased cost of a licensed drug also means that it is monitored by regulatory authorities (e.g. for uncommon side effects), a process that was previously not present in Europe.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hawkes N, Cohen D | title = What makes an orphan drug? | journal = BMJ | volume = 341 | issue =  | pages = c6459 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21081607 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.c6459 }}</ref>  A 2011 Cochrane review compared the cost of the 3,4-DAP and 3,4-DAPP in the UK and found an average price for 3,4-DAP base of £1/tablet and an average price for 3,4-DAP phosphate of £20/tablet; and the authors estimated a yearly cost per person of £730 for the base versus £29,448 for the phosphate formulation.<ref name=Cochrane2011/><ref name=NHS2015>{{cite web|title=Evidence Review: Amifampridine phosphate for the treatment of Lambert–Easton Myasthenic Syndrome|url=https://www.engage.england.nhs.uk/consultation/clinical-commissioning-wave2/user_uploads/d04-x01-amifampridine-ev-review.pdf|publisher=NHS England|date=December 2015}}</ref>

In the face of the 7 year exclusivity that an orphan approval would give to Biomarin, and of the increase in price that would accompany it, Jacobus began racing to conduct formal clinical trials in order to get approval for the free base form before BioMarin; its first Phase II trial was opened in January 2012.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wahl|first1=Margaret|title=Jacobus Begins Invitation-Only Trial of 3,4-DAP in LEMS|url=http://quest.mda.org/news/jacobus-begins-invitation-only-trial-34-dap-lems|work=Muscular Dystrophy Association Quest Magazine Online|date=January 25, 2012}}</ref>
