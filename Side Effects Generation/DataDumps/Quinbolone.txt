'''Quinbolone''' (brand name '''Anabolicum Vister''', '''Anabolvis''') is an [[anabolic-androgenic steroid]] (AAS). It was developed by [[Parke-Davis]] in an attempt to create a viable orally-administered anabolic steroid with little or no [[hepatotoxicity|liver toxicity]].

Quinbolone is a [[derivative (chemistry)|derivative]] of [[boldenone]] with an easily removed [[Ether|cyclopentenyl ether]] group.

Most orally administered anabolic steroids function by having an alkylated 17α-[[carbon]] atom, which prevents first-pass metabolism by the liver.{{cn|date=September 2015}} This approach does, however, give the drug a high [[hepatotoxicity]]. Quinbolone is not 17α-alkylated; instead it has increased oral [[bioavailability]] due to its cyclopentenyl ether group.{{cn|date=September 2015}} After ingestion, the inactive quinbolone becomes boldenone.{{cn|date=September 2015}}

Quinbolone itself has very few androgenic effects, and most of what it does have are a result of its conversion to boldenone and its [[metabolite]]s. Because of high doses necessary for androgenic effects, cost and inconvenience meant that quinbolone never proved to be commercially successful, and its clinical applications were fulfilled by alternative, more effective, steroids. Its illicit usage in [[bodybuilding]] and [[Athletics (track and field)|athletics]] likewise proved limited, though [[drug testing|drug tests]] are still used to detect its metabolites as it remains a banned substance for most competitive sports.

===Synthesis===
Quinbolone can be prepared from [[testosterone]].  Dehydrogenation using [[DDQ]] forms [[boldenone]]. Reaction with 1,1-dimethoxycyclopentane followed by heating to [[elimination reaction|eliminate]] [[methanol]] gives quinbolone.
