'''Aspartame''' ('''APM''') is an artificial, non-[[saccharide]] [[sweeteners|sweetener]] used as a [[sugar substitute]] in some foods and beverages. In the European Union, it is codified as [[E number|E951]]. Aspartame is a [[Methyl group|methyl]] [[ester]] of the [[aspartic acid]]/[[phenylalanine]] [[dipeptide]].

Aspartame is approximately 200 times sweeter than [[sucrose]] (table sugar). Due to this property, even though aspartame produces four kilocalories of energy per gram ({{convert|4|kcal|kJ|disp=out}}/g) when metabolized, the quantity of aspartame needed to produce a sweet taste is so small that its caloric contribution is negligible.<ref name=Magnuson/>  The taste of aspartame and other artificial sweeteners differs from that of table sugar in the times of onset and how long the sweetness lasts, though aspartame comes closest to sugar's taste profile among approved artificial sweeteners.<ref name=odonnell /><!-- Section 6.1.2 pp. 87–88 --> The sweetness of aspartame lasts longer than that of sucrose, so it is often blended with other artificial sweeteners such as [[acesulfame potassium]] to produce an overall taste more like that of sugar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodproductdesign.com/articles/2007/05/new-products-weigh-in.aspx |title=New Products Weigh In |publisher=foodproductdesign.com |accessdate=19 June 2010 }}</ref>

Like many other [[peptide]]s, aspartame may [[hydrolyze]] (break down) into its constituent amino acids under conditions of elevated temperature or high [[pH]]. This makes aspartame undesirable as a baking sweetener, and prone to degradation in products hosting a high pH, as required for a long shelf life. The stability of aspartame under heating can be improved to some extent by encasing it in fats or in [[maltodextrin]]. The stability when dissolved in water depends markedly on [[pH]]. At room temperature, it is most stable at pH 4.3, where its [[half-life]] is nearly 300 days. At pH 7, however, its [[half-life]] is only a few days. Most soft-drinks have a pH between 3 and 5, where aspartame is reasonably stable. In products that may require a longer shelf life, such as [[syrups]] for [[soda fountain|fountain beverages]], aspartame is sometimes blended with a more stable sweetener, such as [[saccharin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/mail/goodanswer/us_fountain_beverages.pdf |publisher=[[The Coca-Cola Company]] |title=Fountain Beverages in the US |date=May 2007 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320175404/http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/mail/goodanswer/us_fountain_beverages.pdf |archivedate=20 March 2009 }}</ref>

===Phenylketonuria===

High levels of the naturally occurring [[essential amino acid]] [[phenylalanine]] are a health hazard to those born with [[phenylketonuria]] (PKU), a rare inherited disease that prevents phenylalanine from being properly metabolized. Since individuals with PKU must consider aspartame as an additional source of phenylalanine, foods containing aspartame sold in the United States must state "Phenylketonurics: Contains Phenylalanine" on their product labels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=172.804|title=CFR - Code of Federal Regulations Title 21|date=|work=fda.gov|accessdate=15 January 2016}}</ref>

In the UK, foods that contain aspartame are legally required by the country's [[Food Standards Agency]] to list the substance among the product's ingredients and carry the warning "Contains a source of phenylalanine" – this is usually at the foot of the list of ingredients. Manufacturers are also required to print '"with sweetener(s)" on the label close to the main product name on foods that contain "sweeteners such as aspartame" or "with sugar and sweetener(s)" on "foods that contain both sugar and sweetener".<ref name="FSA2015">{{cite web |url=https://www.food.gov.uk/science/additives/aspartame |title=Aspartame |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=19 March 2015 |website=UK Food Standards Agency |publisher= |access-date=28 June 2017 |quote=}}</ref>

In Canada, foods that contain aspartame are legally required by the country to list the substance among the product's ingredients and include a measure of the amount of aspartame per serving. As well, labels must state that the product contains phenylalanine – this is usually in the order of ingredients, contained in brackets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nutrasweet.com/articles/sendfile.asp?Id=161&filename=AF-TB-03-005.pdf |title=NGREDIENT S PECIFICATIONS NutraSweet ® Custom Powder |publisher=NutraSweet |accessdate=25 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508231731/http://www.nutrasweet.com/articles/sendfile.asp?Id=161&filename=AF-TB-03-005.pdf |archivedate=8 May 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>

Phenylalanine is one of the [[essential amino acid]]s and is required for normal growth and maintenance of life. Concerns about the safety of phenylalanine from aspartame for those without phenylketonuria center largely on hypothetical changes in [[neurotransmitter]] levels as well as ratios of neurotransmitters to each other in the blood and brain that could lead to neurological symptoms. Reviews of the literature have found no consistent findings to support such concerns,<ref name=Butchko/> and while high doses of aspartame consumption may have some biochemical effects, these effects are not seen in toxicity studies to suggest aspartame can adversely affect neuronal function.<ref name=Magnuson/> Like methanol, common foods in the typical diet, such as milk, meat, and fruits, will lead to ingestion of significantly higher amounts of phenylalanine than would be expected from aspartame consumption.<ref name=Butchko/>

===Breast feeding===

In a study done in 1979, the effect of aspartame ingestion on blood and milk amino acid levels in lactating women was tested.<ref name="autogenerated1979">{{cite journal|pmid=512705|year=1979|author1=Stegink|first1=L. D.|title=Plasma, erythrocyte and human milk levels of free amino acids in lactating women administered aspartame or lactose|journal=The Journal of Nutrition|volume=109|issue=12|pages=2173–81|last2=Filer Jr|first2=L.

L.}}</ref> In this study, six women from the ages of 20 to 29 with established lactation were studied after oral administration of aspartame or lactose (50&nbsp;mg/kg body weight) in a random order, with the intent to study the differences in breast milk between the two. The study resulted with the conclusion that aspartame administration at 50&nbsp;mg/kg body weight has a small effect upon the milk aspartate levels; and, although a small increase in aspartate time-effect scores was noted over the four-hour postabsorptive period, no significant difference was noted over the entire 24-hour watching period.<ref name="autogenerated1979"/>

===Cancer===

Reviews have found no association between aspartame and cancer. These reviews have looked at numerous carcinogenicity studies in animals, epidemiologic studies in humans, as well as ''in vitro'' [[genotoxicity]] studies. These studies have found no significant evidence that aspartame causes cancer in animals, damages the genome, or causes cancer in humans at doses currently used.<ref name=Magnuson/><ref name=EFSAExperts/><ref name=Butchko/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marinovich|first1=M|last2=Galli|first2=CL|last3=Bosetti|first3=C|last4=Gallus|first4=S|last5=La Vecchia|first5=C|title=Aspartame, low-calorie sweeteners and disease: regulatory safety and epidemiological issues.|journal=Food and Chemical Toxicology|date=October 2013|volume=60|pages=109–15|doi=10.1016/j.fct.2013.07.040|pmid=23891579}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kirkland|first1=D|last2=Gatehouse|first2=D|title="Aspartame: A review of genotoxicity data".|journal=Food and Chemical Toxicology|date=October 2015|volume=84|pages=161-8|doi=10.1016/j.fct.2015.08.021|pmid=26321723}}</ref> This position is supported by multiple regulatory agencies like the FDA<ref name=FDAstatement>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/FoodAdditives/ucm208580.htm |title=US FDA/CFSAN – FDA Statement on European Aspartame Study |accessdate=23 September 2010 |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100730225205/http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/FoodAdditives/ucm208580.htm |archivedate=30 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref> and EFSA as well as scientific bodies such as the [[National Cancer Institute]].<ref name=NCIFAQ/> Aspartame did not show any DNA-damaging properties either.<ref name=Weihrauch/>

Concern about possible [[carcinogen]]ic properties of aspartame was originally raised and popularized in the mainstream media by [[John Olney]] in the 1970s and again in 1996 by suggesting that aspartame may be related to brain tumors. Reviews have found that these concerns were flawed, due to reliance on the [[ecological fallacy]]<ref name=Weihrauch>{{cite journal |last1=Weihrauch |first1=M. R. |last2=Diehl |first2=V |title=Artificial sweeteners – do they bear a carcinogenic risk? |journal=Annals of Oncology |volume=15 |issue=10 |pages=1460–5 |year=2004 |pmid=15367404 |doi=10.1093/annonc/mdh256}}</ref> and the purported mechanism of causing tumors being unlikely to actually cause cancer. Independent agencies such as the FDA and [[National Cancer Institute]] have reanalyzed multiple studies based on these worries and found no association between aspartame and brain cancer.<ref name=Butchko/>

As discussed in the article on [[Aspartame controversy|controversies around aspartame]], the Cesare Maltoni Cancer Research Center of the European Ramazzini Foundation of Oncology and Environmental Sciences released several studies which claimed that aspartame can increase several malignancies in rodents, concluding that aspartame is a potential carcinogen at normal dietary doses.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Environ Health Perspect |year= 2006 |volume= 114 |issue= 3 |pages= 379–385 |title=First Experimental Demonstration of the Multipotential Carcinogenic Effects of Aspartame Administered in the Feed to Sprague-Dawley Rats| first1= M. |last1=  Soffritti |first2= F. |last2= Belpoggi |first3= D.D. |last3= Esposti |first4= L. |last4= Lambertini |first5= E. |last5= Tibaldi |first6= A. |pmc= 1392232 |last6= Rigano |doi= 10.1289/ehp.8711 |pmid=16507461}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |journal= Environ Health Perspect |year= 2007 |volume= 115 | issue= 9 |pages= 1293–1297 |title= Life-span exposure to low doses of aspartame beginning during prenatal life increases cancer effects in rats |last1= Soffritti |first1= M. |last2= Belpoggi |first2= F. |last3= Tibaldi |first3= E. |last4= Esposti |first4= D.D. |last5= Lauriola |first5= M. |pmid= 17805418 |doi= 10.1289/ehp.10271 |pmc=1964906}}</ref>  The EFSA<ref name=EFSAreport>{{cite journal |author=Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food |title=Opinion of the Scientific Panel on food additives, flavourings, processing aids and materials in contact with food (AFC) related to a new long-term carcinogenicity study on aspartame |journal=The EFSA Journal |year=2006 |volume=356 |issue=5 |pages=1–44 |doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2006.356}}</ref> and the FDA<ref name=FDAstatement/> discounted the study results due to lack of transparency and numerous flaws in the study, finding no reason to revise their previously established acceptable daily intake levels for aspartame.

=== Neurological and psychiatric symptoms ===

Numerous allegations have been made via the Internet and in consumer magazines purporting neurotoxic effects of aspartame leading to neurological or psychiatric symptoms such as [[seizures]], [[headache]]s, and [[Mood swing|mood changes]].<ref name=Magnuson/> Review of the biochemistry of aspartame has found no evidence that the doses consumed would plausibly lead to neurotoxic effects.<ref name=Lathja>{{cite journal

However, a panel of EFSA experts noted that this review's conclusions were partially based on Internet sources and therefore were not scientifically robust. These experts also concurred with a critique that significant scientific errors were made in the critical review that led to unsubstantiated and misleading interpretations.<ref name=EFSAExperts/> A review of studies on children did not show any significant findings for safety concerns with regard to neuropsychiatric conditions such as [[panic attack]]s, mood changes, [[hallucination]]s or with [[ADHD]] or seizures.<ref name=PediatricsReview/>

Initially, aspartame was approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1974; however, problems with Searle's safety testing program, including testing of aspartame, were discovered subsequently. The approval was rescinded the following year; but, after outside reviews of the problematic tests and additional testing, final approval was granted in 1981.

==Mechanism of action==

The perceived sweetness of aspartame (and other sweet substances like acesulfame K) in humans is due to its binding of the heterodimer G-protein coupled receptor formed by the proteins [[TAS1R2]] and [[TAS1R3]].<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Li XD, Staszewski L, Xu H, Durick K, Zoller M, Adler E | title=Human receptors for sweet and umami taste  | journal=Proc.

=== Metabolites ===

Aspartame is rapidly [[Hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] in the [[small intestine]]s. Even with ingestion of very high doses of aspartame (over 200&nbsp;mg/kg), no aspartame is found in the blood due to the rapid breakdown.<ref name=Magnuson/> Upon ingestion, aspartame breaks down into residual components, including [[aspartic acid]], [[phenylalanine]], [[methanol]],<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Roberts HJ |title=Aspartame disease: a possible cause for concomitant Graves' disease and pulmonary hypertension |journal=Texas Heart Institute Journal |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=105; author reply 105–6 |year=2004 |pmid=15061638 |pmc=387446}}</ref> in ratio of 4:5:1 by mass<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Humphries |first1= P |last2= Pretorius |first2= E |last3= Naudé |first3= H |year= 2008 |title= Direct and indirect cellular effects of aspartame on the brain |journal= Eur J Clin Nutrition |volume= 62 |pages= 451–462 |doi= 10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602866 |pmid= 17684524 |issue= 4 }}</ref> and further breakdown products including [[formaldehyde]]<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Trocho C |title=Formaldehyde derived from dietary aspartame binds to tissue components in vivo |journal=Life Sciences |volume=63 |issue=5 |pages=337–49 |year=1998 |pmid=9714421 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3205(98)00282-3 |author2=Pardo R |author3=Rafecas I |last4=Virgili |first4=J |last5=Remesar |first5=X |last6=Fernández-López |first6=JA |last7=Alemany |first7=M|display-authors=3 }}</ref> and [[formic acid]].

====Aspartate====

Aspartic acid (aspartate) is one of the most common [[amino acid]]s in the typical diet. As with methanol and phenylalanine, intake of aspartic acid from aspartame is less than would be expected from other dietary sources. At the 90th percentile of intake, aspartame provides only between 1% and 2% of the daily intake of aspartic acid. There has been some speculation<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=6152304 |title=Excitotoxic food additives – relevance of animal studies to human safety |volume=6 |issue=6 |year=1984 |pages=455–62 |journal=Neurobehav Toxicol Teratol|author1=Olney |first1=J.

However, clinical studies have shown no signs of neurotoxic effects,<ref name=Magnuson/> and studies of metabolism suggest it is not possible to ingest enough aspartic acid and glutamate through food and drink to levels that would be expected to be toxic.<ref name=Butchko/>

====Methanol====

The [[methanol]] produced by the metabolism of aspartame is absorbed and quickly converted into [[formaldehyde]] and then completely oxidized to [[formic acid]]. The methanol from aspartame is unlikely to be a safety concern for several reasons.  Fruit juices and citrus fruits contain methanol, and there are other dietary sources for methanol such as [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] beverages and the amount of methanol produced from aspartame-sweetened foods and beverages is likely to be less than that from these and other sources that are already in people's diets.<ref name=Magnuson/> With regard to formaldehyde, it is rapidly converted in the body, and the amounts of formaldehyde from the metabolism of aspartame are trivial when compared to the amounts produced routinely by the human body and from other foods and drugs. At the highest expected human doses of consumption of aspartame, there are no increased blood levels of methanol or formic acid,<ref name=Magnuson/> and ingesting aspartame at the 90th percentile of intake would produce 25 times less methanol than what would be considered toxic.<ref name=Butchko/>


==Chemistry==

Aspartame is a [[Methyl group|methyl]] [[ester]] of the [[dipeptide]] of the natural [[amino acid]]s <small>L</small>-[[aspartic acid]] and <small>L</small>-[[phenylalanine]]. Under strongly [[acid]]ic or [[Base (chemistry)|alkaline]] conditions, aspartame may generate [[methanol]] by [[hydrolysis]]. Under more severe conditions, the [[peptide bond]]s are also [[Hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]], resulting in free amino acids.<ref>

In the chemical synthesis, the two carboxyl groups of aspartic acid are joined into an anhydride, and the amino group is [[protective group|protected]] by converting it to a functional group{{clarify|date=August 2016}} that will not interfere in the next reaction. Phenylalanine is converted to its methyl ester and combined with the ''N''-protected aspartic anhydride; then the protecting group is removed from aspartic nitrogen by acid hydrolysis. The drawback of this technique is that a byproduct, the bitter-tasting β-form, is produced when the wrong carboxyl group from aspartic acid links to phenylalanine. A process using an [[Thermolysin|enzyme from ''Bacillus thermoproteolyticus'']] to catalyze the condensation of the chemically altered amino acids will produce high yields without the β-form byproduct. A variant of this method, which has not been used commercially, uses unmodified aspartic acid, but produces low yields. Methods for directly producing aspartyl-phenylalanine by enzymatic means, followed by chemical methylation, have also been tried, but not scaled for industrial production.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Yagasaki |first= Makoto |author2=Hashimoto, Shin-ichi |date=November 2008 |title= Synthesis and application of dipeptides; current status and perspectives |journal= Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology  |volume= 81 |issue= 1 |pages= 13–22 |pmid= 18795289 |doi= 10.1007/s00253-008-1590-3 }}</ref>

The primary source for exposure to aspartame in the United States is diet [[soft drink]]s, though it can be consumed in other products, such as pharmaceutical preparations, fruit drinks, and chewing gum among others in smaller quantities.<ref name=Magnuson/> A 12 US fluid ounce (355 ml) can of diet soda contains {{convert|180|mg|oz}} of aspartame, and for a {{convert|75|kg|lb|abbr=on}} adult, it takes approximately 21 cans of diet soda daily to consume the {{convert|3750|mg|oz}} of aspartame that would surpass the FDA's 50&nbsp;milligrams per kilogram of body weight ADI of aspartame from diet soda alone.<ref name=NCIFAQ/>

Reviews have analyzed studies which have looked at the consumption of aspartame in countries worldwide, including the United States, countries in Europe, and Australia, among others. These reviews have found that even the high levels of intake of aspartame, studied across multiple countries and different methods of measuring aspartame consumption, are well below the ADI for safe consumption of aspartame.<ref name=Magnuson/><ref name=EFSAExperts/><ref name=Butchko/><ref name=Renwick/> Reviews have also found that populations that are believed to be especially high consumers of aspartame such as children and diabetics are below the ADI for safe consumption, even considering extreme worst-case scenario calculations of consumption.<ref name=Magnuson/><ref name=EFSAExperts/>

In a report released on 10 December 2013, the EFSA said that, after an extensive examination of evidence, it ruled out the "potential risk of aspartame causing damage to genes and inducing cancer," and deemed the amount found in diet sodas an amount safe to consume.<ref>{{cite news|title=Aspartame in Soda is Safe: European Review|url=http://www.newsmaxhealth.com/Health-News/artificial-sweeteners-aspartame-food-safety-diet-soft-drinks/2013/12/10/id/541046|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref>

==History==

Aspartame was discovered in 1965 by James M. Schlatter, a chemist working for [[Searle (company)|G.D. Searle & Company]]. Schlatter had [[Chemical synthesis|synthesized]] aspartame as an intermediate step in generating a tetrapeptide of the hormone [[gastrin]], for use in assessing an anti-[[Peptic ulcer|ulcer]] drug candidate.<ref>{{cite book |last= Mazur |first= Robert H. |editor1-last= Inglett  |editor1-first= George E. |title= Symposium: sweeteners |year= 1974 |publisher= AVI Publishing |location= Westport, CT |isbn= 0-87055-153-1 |lccn= 73-94092 |pages= 159–163 |chapter= Aspartic acid-based sweeteners}}</ref> He discovered its sweet taste when he licked his finger, which had become contaminated with aspartame, to lift up a piece of paper.<ref name=Magnuson>{{Cite journal|author=Magnuson BA |title=Aspartame: a safety evaluation based on current use levels, regulations, and toxicological and epidemiological studies |journal=Critical Reviews in Toxicology |volume=37 |issue=8 |pages=629–727 |year=2007 |pmid=17828671 |doi=10.1080/10408440701516184|author2=Burdock GA|author3=Doull J|last4=Kroes|first4=R.

In 1975, prompted by issues regarding [[Flagyl]] and [[Aldactone]], a U.S. FDA task force team reviewed 25 studies submitted by the manufacturer, including 11 on aspartame. The team reported "serious deficiencies in Searle's operations and practices".<ref name="gao-87" /> The FDA sought to authenticate 15 of the submitted studies against the supporting data. In 1979, the [[Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition]] (CFSAN) concluded, since many problems with the aspartame studies were minor and did not affect the conclusions, the studies could be used to assess aspartame's safety.<ref name="gao-87" />

In 1980, the FDA convened a Public Board of Inquiry (PBOI) consisting of independent advisors charged with examining the purported relationship between aspartame and [[brain cancer]]. The PBOI concluded aspartame does not cause [[Human brain|brain]] damage, but it recommended against approving aspartame at that time, citing unanswered questions about cancer in laboratory rats.<ref name="gao-87">{{cite web|title=U.S. GAO – HRD-87-46 Food and Drug Administration: Food Additive Approval Process Followed for Aspartame, 18 June 1987 |accessdate =5 September 2008 | url = http://www.gao.gov/docdblite/info.php?rptno=HRD-87-46}}</ref>{{rp|94–96}}<ref>Testimony of Dr. Adrian Gross, Former FDA Investigator to the U.S. Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, 3 November 1987.

Several European Union countries approved aspartame in the 1980s, with EU-wide approval in 1994. The European Commission [[Scientific Committee on Food]] reviewed subsequent safety studies and reaffirmed the approval in 2002.

==Commercial uses==

Under the trade names [[Equal (sweetener)|Equal]], [[NutraSweet]], and [[Canderel]], aspartame is an ingredient in approximately 6,000 consumer foods and beverages sold worldwide, including (but not limited to) diet sodas and other soft drinks, instant breakfasts, breath mints, cereals, sugar-free chewing gum, cocoa mixes, frozen desserts, gelatin desserts, juices, laxatives, chewable vitamin supplements, milk drinks, pharmaceutical drugs and supplements, shake mixes, tabletop sweeteners, teas, [[instant coffee]]s, topping mixes, wine coolers and yogurt. It is provided as a table [[condiment]] in some countries. Aspartame is less suitable for [[baking]] than other sweeteners, because it [[chemical decomposition|breaks down]] when heated and loses much of its sweetness.

===NutraSweet Company===

In 1985, [[Monsanto Company]] bought G.D.{{nbsp}}Searle, and the aspartame business became a separate Monsanto subsidiary, the [[NutraSweet|NutraSweet Company]]. In March 2000, Monsanto sold it to [[J.W.

Many aspects of industrial synthesis of aspartame were established by Ajinomoto.<ref name=odonnell /> In 2004, the market for aspartame, in which [[Ajinomoto]], the world's largest aspartame manufacturer, had a 40 percent share, was 14,000 metric tons a year, and consumption of the product was rising by 2 percent a year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a1rBnsdDJnM8&refer=japan |title=Ajinomoto May Exceed Full-Year Forecasts on Amino Acid Products – Bloomberg |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=23 June 2010 |date=18 November 2004}}</ref> Ajinomoto acquired its aspartame business in 2000 from [[Monsanto]] for $67M.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icis.com/Articles/2000/06/05/114953/sweetener-sale.html |title=Sweetener sale-05/06/2000-ECN |publisher=icis.com |accessdate=9 July 2010 }}</ref>

In 2008, Ajinomoto sued British supermarket chain [[Asda]], part of [[Wal-Mart]], for a malicious falsehood action concerning its aspartame product when the substance was listed as excluded from the chain's product line, along with other "nasties".<ref name="asda">{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=441128&in_page_id=2 |title=Asda gears up for additives battle/ aspartame |work=Evening Standard |location=London |accessdate=23 June 2010 |quote=This is Money }}</ref> In July 2009, a British court found in favour of Asda.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodanddrinkeurope.com/Products-Marketing/Asda-claims-victory-in-aspartame-nasty-case |title=Asda claims victory in aspartame 'nasty' case |publisher=foodanddrinkeurope.com |accessdate=23 June 2010 }}</ref> In June 2010, an appeals court reversed the decision, allowing Ajinomoto to pursue a case against Asda to protect aspartame's reputation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodbev.com/news/court-of-appeal-rules-in-ajinomotoasda-aspartame-case |title=FoodBev.com |publisher=foodbev.com |accessdate=23 June 2010|quote=Court of Appeal rules in Ajinomoto/Asda aspartame case }}</ref> Asda said that it would continue to use the term "no nasties" on its own-label products,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodnavigator.com/Legislation/Radical-new-twist-in-Ajinomoto-vs-Asda-nasty-battle |title=Radical new twist in Ajinomoto vs Asda 'nasty' battle |publisher=foodnavigator.com |accessdate=23 June 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100606185621/http://www.foodnavigator.com/Legislation/Radical-new-twist-in-Ajinomoto-vs-Asda-nasty-battle| archivedate= 6 June 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref> but the suit was settled in 2011 with Asda choosing to remove references to aspartame from its packaging.<ref>{{cite news |title= Asda settles 'nasty' aspartame legal battle with Ajinomoto |first= Ben |last= Bouckley |url= http://www.foodnavigator.com/Financial-Industry/Asda-settles-nasty-aspartame-legal-battle-with-Ajinomoto |agency= FoodNavigator.com |publisher= William Reed Business Media SAS |date=18 May 2011 |accessdate=18 July 2011 }}</ref>

In November 2009, [[Ajinomoto]] announced a new brand name for its aspartame sweetener – AminoSweet.<ref name="rebrand">{{cite web|url=http://www.foodnavigator.com/Financial-Industry/Ajinomoto-brands-aspartame-AminoSweet |title=Ajinomoto brands aspartame AminoSweet |publisher=Foodnavigator.com|date=25 November 2009 |accessdate=7 July 2010}}

===Holland Sweetener Company===

A joint venture of [[DSM (company)|DSM]] and [[Tosoh]], the Holland Sweetener Company manufactured aspartame using the enzymatic process developed by Toyo Soda (Tosoh) and sold as the brand Sanecta.<ref>{{cite book |last= Lee |first= Thomas D. |title= Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology |edition= 5th |volume= 24 |year= 2007 |publisher= Wiley |isbn= 0-471-48496-2 |pages= 224–252 |chapter= Sweetners |doi=10.1002/0471238961.19230505120505.a01.pub2}}</ref> Additionally, they developed a combination [[aspartame-acesulfame salt]] under the brand name Twinsweet.<ref>{{cite news |title= Holland Sweetener rolls out Twinsweet |url= http://www.bakeryandsnacks.com/Processing-Packaging/Holland-Sweetener-rolls-out-Twinsweet |accessdate=29 July 2011 |newspaper= BakeryAndSnacks.com |publisher= William Reed Business Media |date= 19 November 2003}}</ref> They left the sweetener industry in late 2006, because "global aspartame markets are facing structural oversupply, which has caused worldwide strong price erosion over the last five years", making the business "persistently unprofitable".<ref>[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/vprr/06/9999999997-06-013522 "Holland Sweetener Company to exit from aspartame business"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507075849/http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/vprr/06/9999999997-06-013522 |date=7 May 2013 }}.

Because [[sucralose]], unlike aspartame, retains its sweetness after being heated, and has at least twice the shelf life of aspartame, it has become more popular as an ingredient.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E6DC1030F931A15751C1A9629C8B63 |title=A Something Among the Sweet Nothings; Splenda Is Leaving Other Sugar Substitutes With That Empty Feeling|newspaper=The New York Times| first=Melanie | last=Warner | date=22 December 2004}}</ref> This, along with differences in marketing and changing consumer preferences, caused aspartame to lose market share to sucralose.<ref>{{Cite news| author = John Schmeltzer | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-12-02/business/0412020391_1_splenda-merisant-worldwide-equal | title = Equal fights to get even as Splenda looks sweet |work=Chicago Tribune |date=2 December 2004 | accessdate =4 July 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| last = Carney | first = Beth | title = It's Not All Sweetness for Splenda | work = BusinessWeek: Daily Briefing | accessdate =5 September 2008 | date = 19 January 2005 | url = http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/jan2005/nf20050119_5391_db014.htm | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081007062929/http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/jan2005/nf20050119_5391_db014.htm| archivedate= 7 October 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref> In 2004, aspartame traded at about $30/kg and sucralose, which is roughly three times sweeter by weight, at around $300/kg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beveragedaily.com/Markets/Aspartame-defence-courts-reaction |title=Aspartame defence courts reaction |publisher=beveragedaily.com |date=7 October 2004 }}</ref>

== Ant-killer hoax ==

Aspartame has been falsely claimed to have been originally developed as ant poison. The source for this was a satirical article posted on "thespoof" website.<ref name="snopes">Mikkelson, David (August 12, 2014)  [http://www.snopes.com/media/notnews/antpoison.asp The worlds best anti poison]. Snopes.com</ref><ref>[http://www.thespoof.com/spoof-news/science-technology/11213/fda-certifies-aspartame-as-ant-poison Spoof news: FDA certifies Aspartame as ant poison]. TheSpoof.com (12 August 2006)</ref> Further claims that the substance actually is poisonous to ants were inferred from that online article being quoted as fact by various anti-aspartame websites, and videos of numerous trials of this rumor have been shown on YouTube, or posted on social networks, some even claiming success in eradicating ants with Aspartame or with other sweeteners.<ref name="snopes" />
