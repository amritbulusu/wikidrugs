Captopril's main uses are based on its vasodilation and inhibition of some renal function activities.  These benefits are most clearly seen in:
1) [[Hypertension]]
2) Cardiac conditions such as [[congestive heart failure]] and after [[myocardial infarction]]
3) Preservation of kidney function in [[diabetic nephropathy]]

Additionally, it has shown mood-elevating properties in some patients. This is consistent with the observation that animal screening models indicate putative antidepressant activity for this compound, although one study has been negative. Formal clinical trials in depressed patients have not been reported.<ref>[http://www.acnp.org/g4/GN401000109/CH107.html Novel Pharmacological Approaches to the Treatment of Depression<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512152306/http://www.acnp.org/g4/GN401000109/CH107.html |date=May 12, 2008 }}</ref>

==History==
Captopril was developed in 1975 by three researchers at the U.S. drug company Squibb (now [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]]): Miguel Ondetti, Bernard Rubin, and David Cushman. Squibb filed for U.S. patent protection on the drug in February 1976 and U.S. Patent 4,046,889 was granted in September 1977.

The development of captopril was among the earliest successes of the revolutionary concept of ligand-based drug design. The [[renin-angiotensin system|renin-angiontensin-aldosterone]] system had been extensively studied in the mid-20th century, and this system presented several opportune targets in the development of novel treatments for hypertension. The first two targets that were attempted were [[renin]] and [[Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme|ACE]]. Captopril was the culmination of efforts by Squibb's laboratories to develop an ACE inhibitor.

Ondetti, Cushman, and colleagues built on work that had been done in the 1960s by a team of researchers led by [[John Vane]] at the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]]. The first breakthrough was made by Kevin K.F. Ng<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ng | first1 = KKF | last2 = Vane | first2 = JR | year = 1967 | title = Conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 216 | issue = | pages = 762–766 | doi=10.1038/216762a0 | pmid=4294626}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ng | first1 = KKF | last2 = Vane | first2 = JR | year = 1968 | title = Fate of angiotensin I in the circulation | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 218 | issue = | pages = 144–150 | doi=10.1038/218144a0 | pmid=4296306}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ng | first1 = KKF | last2 = Vane | first2 = JR | year = 1970 | title = Some properties of angiotensin converting enzyme in the lung in vivo | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 225 | issue = | pages = 1142–1144 | doi=10.1038/2251142b0 | pmid=4313869}}</ref> in 1967, when he found  the conversion of angiotensin  I to angiotensin II took place in the [[pulmonary circulation]] instead of in the [[blood plasma|plasma]]. In contrast, [[Sérgio Henrique Ferreira|Sergio Ferreira]]<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ferreira | first1 = SH | last2 = Vane | first2 = JR | year = 1967 | title = The disappearance of bradykinin and eledoisin in the circulation and vascular beds of the cat | url = | journal = Br.

The conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and the inactivation of bradykinin were thought to be mediated by the same enzyme.

In 1970, using [[bradykinin potentiating factor]] (BPF) provided by Sergio Ferreira,<ref name="pmid12724335">{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith CG, Vane JR |title=The discovery of captopril |journal=FASEB J. |volume=17 |issue=8 |pages=788–9 |date=May 2003 |pmid=12724335 |doi=10.1096/fj.03-0093life |url=http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12724335}}</ref> Ng and Vane found the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II was inhibited during its passage through the pulmonary circulation. BPF was later found to be a peptide in the venom of a lancehead viper ''([[Bothrops jararaca]])'', which was a “collected-product inhibitor” of  the converting enzyme.  Captopril was developed from this peptide after it was found via [[Quantitative structure–activity relationship|QSAR-based]] modification that the terminal sulfhydryl moiety of the peptide provided a high potency of [[ACE inhibitor|ACE inhibition]].<ref name=Patlak>{{cite journal | author = Patlak M | title = From viper's venom to drug design: treating hypertension | journal = FASEB J. | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 421 |date=March 2004 | pmid = 15003987 | doi = 10.1096/fj.03-1398bkt }}</ref><ref name="Patlak"/>

Captopril gained FDA approval on April 6, 1981. The drug became a generic medicine in the U.S. in February 1996, when the market exclusivity held by Bristol-Myers Squibb for captopril expired.

The development of captopril has been claimed as an instance of 'biopiracy' ([[commercialization of traditional medicines]]), since no benefits have flowed back to the indigenous Brazilian tribe who first used pit viper venom as an arrowhead poison.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/12/22/us-brazil-biopiracy-idUSTRE6BL37820101222 Ellsworth B., Brazil to step up crackdown on "biopiracy" in 2011, Ruters, Dec. 22, 2010]</ref>

==Pharmacokinetics==
Unlike the majority of ACE inhibitors, captopril is not administered as a prodrug (the only other being [[lisinopril]]).<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 9577953 | year = 1998 | last1 = Brown | first1 = NJ | last2 = Vaughan | first2 = DE | title = Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors | volume = 97 | issue = 14 | pages = 1411–20 | journal = Circulation | doi =10.1161/01.cir.97.14.1411|url=https://circ.ahajournals.org/content/97/14/1411.full}}</ref> About 70% of orally administered captopril is absorbed. [[Bioavailability]] is reduced by presence of food in stomach.

==Developments from captopril==

===Limitations of captopril===
The [[adverse drug reaction]] (ADR) profile of captopril is similar to other [[ACE inhibitor]]s, with cough being the most common ADR.<ref>Rossi S, editor. [[Australian Medicines Handbook]] 2006. Adelaide: Australian Medicines Handbook; 2006.</ref> However, captopril is also commonly associated with rash and taste disturbances (metallic or loss of taste), which are attributed to the unique [[thiol]] moiety.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 90928 | year = 1979 | last1 = Atkinson | first1 = AB | last2 = Robertson | first2 = JI | title = Captopril in the treatment of clinical hypertension and cardiac failure | volume = 2 | issue = 8147 | pages = 836–9 | journal = Lancet | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(79)92186-X}}</ref>

Captopril also has a relatively poor pharmacokinetic profile. The short [[elimination half-life|half-life]] necessitates two or three times per day dosing, which may reduce patient [[Compliance (medicine)|compliance]].

===Subsequent ACE inhibitors===
The adverse effect and pharmacokinetic limitations of captopril stimulated the development of [[enalapril]] and subsequent ACE inhibitors. These were specifically designed to lack the sulfhydryl moiety believed to be responsible for rash and taste disturbance.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 6253826 | year = 1980 | last1 = Patchett | first1 = AA | last2 = Harris | first2 = E | last3 = Tristram | first3 = EW | last4 = Wyvratt | first4 = MJ | last5 = Wu | first5 = MT | last6 = Taub | first6 = D | last7 = Peterson | first7 = ER | last8 = Ikeler | first8 = TJ | last9 = Ten Broeke | first9 = J | title = A new class of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors | volume = 288 | issue = 5788 | pages = 280–3 | journal = Nature | doi=10.1038/288280a0 | last10 = Payne | first10 = L.

All have longer half-lives and are given once or twice daily, which may improve patient compliance.

==Adverse effects==
{{Main article|ACE inhibitor#Adverse effects}}

Adverse effects of captopril include cough due to increase in the plasma levels of bradykinin, [[angioedema]], [[agranulocytosis]], [[proteinuria]], [[hyperkalemia]], [[dysgeusia|taste alteration]], [[teratogen]]icity, [[postural hypotension]], [[acute renal failure]], and [[leukopenia]].<ref name="captopril adverse effects">{{cite web|url=http://mc.lifehugger.com/moc/157/captopril-ace-inhibitor-side-effects |title=Captopril (ACE inhibitor): side effects |date=07-09-2008 |publisher=lifehugger |accessdate=2009-05-02 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
Except for postural hypotension, which occurs due to short and fast mode of action of captopril, most of the side effects mentioned are common for all ACE inhibitors. Among these, cough is the most common adverse effect. [[Hyperkalemia]] can occur, especially if used with other drugs which elevate potassium level in blood, such as potassium-sparing [[diuretics]]. Other side effects are:

* [[Itching]]
* [[Headache]]
* [[Tachycardia]]
* [[Chest pain]]
* [[Palpitations]]
* [[Weakness]]
