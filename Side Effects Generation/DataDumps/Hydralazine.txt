== Medical use ==
Hydralazine is not used as a primary drug for treating hypertension because it elicits a reflex [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] stimulation of the heart (the [[baroreceptor reflex]]).<ref name=Cochrane2011rev>{{cite journal|last1=Kandler|first1=MR|last2=Mah|first2=GT|last3=Tejani|first3=AM|last4=Stabler|first4=SN|last5=Salzwedel|first5=DM|title=Hydralazine for essential hypertension.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=9 November 2011|issue=11|pages=CD004934|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004934.pub4|pmid=22071816}}</ref> The sympathetic stimulation may increase heart rate and [[cardiac output]], and in people with coronary artery disease may cause [[angina pectoris]] or [[myocardial infarction]].<ref name=Harvey/> Hydralazine may also increase [[blood plasma|plasma]] [[renin]] concentration, resulting in fluid retention. To prevent these undesirable side effects, hydralazine is usually prescribed in combination with a [[Beta blocker|β-blocker]] (e.g., [[propranolol]]) and a [[diuretic]].<ref name=Harvey/> Beta-blockers licensed to treat heart failure in the UK include bisoprolol, carvedilol, and nebivolol.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Hydralazine is used to treat severe hypertension, but again, it is not a first-line therapy for [[essential hypertension]]. However, hydralazine is the first-line therapy for hypertension in pregnancy, with [[methyldopa]].<ref name=Bhushan>Bhushan, Vikas, Tao T. Lee, and Ali Ozturk. First Aid for the USMLE Step 1. New York: McGraw-Hill Medical, 2007. 251.</ref>

Hydralazine is commonly used in combination with [[isosorbide dinitrate]] for the treatment of [[congestive heart failure]] in self-identified African American populations. This preparation, [[isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine]], was the first race-based prescription drug.<ref name=Ferdinand2014rev>{{cite journal|last1=Ferdinand|first1=KC|last2=Elkayam|first2=U|last3=Mancini|first3=D|last4=Ofili|first4=E|last5=Piña|first5=I|last6=Anand|first6=I|last7=Feldman|first7=AM|last8=McNamara|first8=D|last9=Leggett|first9=C|title=Use of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine in African-Americans with heart failure 9 years after the African-American Heart Failure Trial.|journal=The American journal of cardiology|date=1 July 2014|volume=114|issue=1|pages=151–9|pmid=24846808|url=http://www.ajconline.org/article/S0002-9149(14)00975-8/pdf}}</ref>

It should not be used in people with [[tachycardia]], heart failure, who have constrictive [[pericarditis]], who have [[lupus]], a dissecting [[aortic aneurism]], or [[porphyria]].<ref name=UKlabel2016/>

== Adverse effects ==
Prolonged treatment may cause a syndrome similar to [[lupus]] which can become fatal if the symptoms are not noticed and drug treatment stopped.<ref name =UKlabel2016/>

Very common (>10% frequency) side effects include headache, [[Tachycardia|high heart rate]], and [[palpitations]].<ref name=UKlabel2016>{{cite web|title=Hydralazine Tablets 50mg|url=https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/24412|work=UK Electronic Medicines Compendium|date=September 7, 2016|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227063940/https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/24412|archivedate=February 27, 2017|df=}}</ref>

Common (1–10% frequency) side effects include [[Flushing (physiology)|flushing]],  [[hypotension]], [[Angina pectoris|angina]]l symptoms, aching or swelling joints, muscle aches,  positive tests for [[Atrial natriuretic peptide|ANP]], stomach upset, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, and [[edema|swelling]] (sodium and water retention).<ref name =UKlabel2016/>

Drugs subject to a strong first-pass effect such as [[Beta blocker|β-blocker]]s may increase the bioavailability of hydralazine.<ref name =UKlabel2016/> [[Epinephrine]] (adrenaline)'s heart rate-accelerating effects are increased by hydralazine, hence may lead to toxicity.<ref name =UKlabel2016/>
