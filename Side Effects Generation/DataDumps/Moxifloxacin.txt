==Medical uses==
Moxifloxacin is used to treat a number of infections, including: [[respiratory tract infections]], [[cellulitis]], [[anthrax]], intraabdominal infections, [[endocarditis]], [[meningitis]], and [[tuberculosis]].<ref name=AHFS>{{cite web|title=Avelox|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/avelox.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref>

In the United States, moxifloxacin is licensed for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, community acquired pneumonia, complicated and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, and complicated intra-abdominal infections.<ref name="www.accessdata.fda.gov">{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/021085s55-021277s052lbl.pdf |title=www.accessdata.fda.gov |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> In the European Union, it is licensed for acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, non-severe community-acquired pneumonia, and acute bacterial sinusitis. Based on its investigation into reports of rare but severe cases of liver toxicity and skin reactions, the European Medicines Agency recommended in 2008 that the use of the by mouth (but not the IV) form of moxifloxacin be restricted to infections in which other antibacterial agents cannot be used or have failed.<ref name="www.emea.europa.eu">{{cite web |url=http://www.emea.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Press_release/2010/08/WC500095423.pdf |title=www.emea.europa.eu |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>  In the US, the marketing approval does not contain these restrictions, though the label contains prominent warnings against skin reactions.

The initial approval by the FDA (December 1999)<ref>http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/1999/21085ltr.pdf</ref> encompassed these indications:

==Contraindications==

Only two listed contraindications are found within the 2008 package insert:

*"[[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug|Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs): Although not observed with moxifloxacin in preclinical and clinical trials, the concomitant administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with a fluoroquinolone may increase the risks of [[Central nervous system|CNS]] stimulation and convulsions."<ref name="insert">{{cite web |author=Bayer |title=AVELOX (moxifloxacin hydrochloride) Tablets AVELOX I.V.

*"Moxifloxacin is contraindicated in persons with a history of hypersensitivity to moxifloxacin, any member of the quinolone class of antimicrobial agents, or any of the product components."<ref name="insert" />

Though not stated as such within the package insert, ziprasidone is also considered to be contraindicated, as it may have the potential to prolong QT interval. Moxifloxacin should also be avoided in patients with uncorrected hypokalemia, or concurrent administration of other medications known to prolong the QT interval (antipsychotics and tricyclic antidepressants).<ref name="umm.edu">{{cite web |title=Moxifloxacin |url=http://www.gmedication.com/?a=moxifloxacin |publisher=University of Maryland Medical Center |year=2009 |accessdate=22 July 2009}}</ref>

Moxifloxacin should be used with caution in patients suffering from diabetes, as glucose regulation may be significantly altered.<ref name="umm.edu"/>

Moxifloxacin is also considered to be contraindicated within the pediatric population, [[pregnancy]], nursing mothers, patients with a history of tendon disorder, patients with documented QT prolongation,<ref>http://www.akdae.de/Arzneimittelsicherheit/RHB/Archiv/2009/20090119.pdf</ref> and patients with [[epilepsy]] or other seizure disorders. Coadministration of moxifloxacin with other drugs that also prolong the QT interval or induce bradycardia (e.g., beta-blockers, amiodarone) should be avoided. Careful consideration should be given in the use of moxifloxacin in patients with cardiovascular disease, including those with conduction abnormalities.<ref name="umm.edu"/>

=== Pregnancy ===
Well-controlled studies of the safety of moxifloxacin in pregnancy or lactating mothers have not been performed.  Animal studies suggest the potential for harm to the fetus in pregnancy, and suggest that moxifloxacin may be excreted into the milk of lactating mothers.  Decisions as to whether to continue therapy during pregnancy or while breast feeding should take the potential risk of harm to the fetus or child into account, as well as the importance of the drug to the well being of the mother.<ref name="www.merck.com">{{cite web |url=https://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/a/avelox/avelox_pi.pdf |title=www.merck.com |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

=== Pediatric population ===
The safety of moxifloxacin in children under age 18 has not been established.  Animal studies suggest the potential for musculoskeletal harm in juveniles.<ref name="www.merck.com"/>

==Interactions==
Moxifloxacin is not believed to be associated with clinically significant drug interactions due to inhibition or stimulation of hepatic metabolism. Thus, it should not, for the most part, require special clinical or laboratory monitoring to ensure its safety.<ref>[http://cme.medscape.com/viewarticle/409517_8 Medscape: Medscape Access<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Moxifloxacin has a potential for a serious drug interaction with NSAIDs.<ref name="69.20.19.211">http://69.20.19.211/cder/warn/dec99/wl121599.pdf</ref>

The combination of [[corticosteroids]] and moxifloxacin has increased potential to result in tendonitis and disability.<ref>{{cite web |author=Renata Albrecht |title=NDA 21-085/S-012 |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2002/21-085s012ltr.pdf |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) |date=16 May 2002 |accessdate=17 July 2009}}</ref>

Antacids containing [[aluminium]] or [[magnesium]] [[ion]]s inhibit the absorption of moxifloxacin. Drugs that prolong the [[QT interval]] (e.g., [[pimozide]]) may have an additive effect on QT prolongation and lead to increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias. The [[prothrombin time|international normalised ratio]] may be increased or decreased in patients treated with [[warfarin]].<ref name="69.20.19.211"/>

==Overdose==
"In the event of acute overdose, the stomach should be emptied and adequate hydration maintained. ECG monitoring is recommended due to the possibility of QT interval prolongation. The patient should be carefully observed and given supportive treatment. The administration of activated charcoal as soon as possible after oral overdose may prevent excessive increase of systemic moxifloxacin exposure. About 3% and 9% of the dose of moxifloxacin, as well as about 2% and 4.5% of its glucuronide metabolite are removed by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis, respectively." (Quoting from the 29 December 2008 package insert for Avelox)<ref name="insert" />

==Mechanism of action==
Moxifloxacin is a [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]] that is active against both
[[Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative]] bacteria. It functions by inhibiting [[DNA gyrase]], a type II [[topoisomerase]], and topoisomerase IV,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Drlica K, Zhao X |title=DNA gyrase, topoisomerase IV, and the 4-quinolones |journal=Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=377–92 |date=1 September 1997|pmid=9293187 |pmc=232616 |url=http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9293187 }}</ref> enzymes necessary to separate bacterial DNA, thereby inhibiting cell replication.

==Pharmacokinetics==
About 52% of an oral or intravenous dose of moxifloxacin is metabolized via glucuronide and sulfate conjugation. The cytochrome P450 system is not involved in moxifloxacin metabolism, and is not affected by moxifloxacin. The sulfate conjugate (M1) accounts for around 38% of the dose, and is eliminated primarily in the feces. Approximately 14% of an oral or intravenous dose is converted to a glucuronide conjugate (M2), which is excreted exclusively in the urine. Peak plasma concentrations of M2 are about 40% those of the parent drug, while plasma concentrations of M1 are, in general, less than 10% those of moxifloxacin.<ref name="insert" />

''In vitro'' studies with cytochrome (CYP) P450 enzymes indicate that moxifloxacin does not inhibit 80 CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP1A2, suggesting that moxifloxacin is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized by these enzymes.<ref name="insert" />

The pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin in pediatric subjects have not been studied.<ref name="insert" />

The half-life of moxifloxacin is 11.5-15.6 hours (single-dose, oral).<ref name="drugbank.ca">{{cite web |title=Drug card for Moxifloxacin (DB00218) |url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00218 |publisher=DrugBank |location=Canada |date=19 February 2009 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> About 45% of an oral or intravenous dose of moxifloxacin is excreted as unchanged drug (about 20% in urine and 25% in feces). A total of 96 ± 4% of an oral dose is excreted as either unchanged drug or known metabolites. The mean (± SD) apparent total body clearance and renal clearance are 12 ± 2&nbsp;L/h and 2.6 ± 0.5&nbsp;L/h, respectively.<ref name="drugbank.ca"/> The CSF penetration of moxifloxacin is 70% to 80% in patients with meningitis.<ref>{{cite journal|pages=1080–2|title=Pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma in patients with tuberculous meningitis|author1=Alffenaar J.

==Patent==
A United States patent application was made on 30 June 1989, for Avelox, Bayer A.G. being the assignee, which was subsequently approved on 5 February 1991. This patent was scheduled to expire on 30 June 2009. However, this patent was extended for an additional two and one half years on 16 September 2004, and as such was not expected to expire until 2012.<ref>http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/dapp/opla/term/certs/4990517.pdf</ref>
Moxifloxacin was subsequently (ten years later) approved by the FDA for use in the United States in 1999.

===Regulatory actions===
Regulatory agencies have taken actions to address certain rare but serious adverse events associated with moxifloxacin therapy.

Based on its investigation into reports of rare but severe cases of liver toxicity and skin reactions, the European Medicines Agency recommended in 2008 that the use of the oral (but not the IV) form of moxifloxacin be restricted to infections in which other antibacterial agents cannot be used or have failed.<ref name="www.emea.europa.eu"/>  Similarly, the Canadian label includes a warning of the risk of liver injury.<ref>Updated Labeling for Antibiotic Avelox (Moxifloxacin) Regarding Risk of Severe Liver Injury / Information Update: 2010-42 For immediate release 22 March 2010 http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/advisories-avis/_2010/2010_42-eng.php</ref>

The U.S. label does not contain restrictions similar to the European label, but a carries a "black box" warning of the risk of tendon damage and/or rupture and warnings regarding the risk of irreversible peripheral neuropathy.<ref>{{cite web |author=Renata Albrecht |title=NDA 21-085/S-040, NDA 21-277/S-034 |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2008/021085s040,%20021277s034ltr.pdf |work=Center for Drug Evaluation and Research |publisher=Food and Drug Administration |date=3 October 2008 |accessdate=31 July 2009}}</ref>

In 2007, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware held that two Bayer patents on Avelox are valid and enforceable, and infringed by Dr. Reddy's ANDA for a generic version of Avelox.<ref name="ribfoap">{{cite web |author=Bayer AG |authorlink=Bayer AG |title=Ruling in Bayer's favor over Avelox patents |url=http://www.stockholders-newsletter-q3-07.bayer.com/en/avelox-patents.aspx |publisher=Bayer |date=6 November 2007 |accessdate=29 August 2009}}</ref><ref>http://www.orangebookblog.com/Bayer_20v._20Dr._20Reddy_27s.pdf</ref> The district court sided with Bayer, citing the Federal Circuit's prior decision in ''Takeda v. Alphapharm''<ref>{{cite web|title=United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit |url=http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/06-1329.pdf |publisher=uscourts.gov |date=28 June 2007 |accessdate=29 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826202547/http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/06-1329.pdf |archivedate=26 August 2009 }}</ref> as "affirming the district court's finding that defendant failed to prove a prima facie case of obviousness where the [[prior art]] disclosed a broad selection of compounds, any one of which could have been selected as a lead compound for further investigation, and defendant did not prove that the prior art would have led to the selection of the particular compound singled out by defendant." According to Bayer's press release<ref name="ribfoap" /> announcing the court's decision, it was noted that Teva had also challenged the validity of the same Bayer patents at issue in the Dr. Reddy's case. Within Bayer's first-quarter 2008 stockholder's newsletter<ref>{{cite web |author=Bayer AG |authorlink=Bayer AG |title=Risk Report |url=http://www.stockholders-newsletter-q1-08.bayer.com/en/Risk-Report.aspx |publisher=Bayer |date=24 April 2008 |accessdate=29 August 2009}}</ref> Bayer stated that they had reached an agreement with Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., the adverse party, to settle their patent litigation with regard to the two Bayer patents. Under the settlement terms agreed upon, Teva would obtain a license to sell its generic moxifloxacin tablet product in the U.S. shortly before the second of the two Bayer patents expires in March 2014.  In Bangladesh, it is available with brand name of Optimox.
