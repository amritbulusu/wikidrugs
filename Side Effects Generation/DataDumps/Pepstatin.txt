'''Pepstatin''' is a potent inhibitor of [[aspartyl protease]]s.  It is a hexa-[[peptide]] containing the unusual amino acid [[statine]] ('''Sta''', (3S,4S)-4-amino-3-hydroxy-6-methylheptanoic acid), having the sequence Isovaleryl-Val-Val-Sta-Ala-Sta (Iva-Val-Val-Sta-Ala-Sta).<ref name="pmid4912600">{{cite journal |vauthors=Umezawa H, Aoyagi T, Morishima H, Matsuzaki M, Hamada M |title=Pepstatin, a new pepsin inhibitor produced by Actinomycetes |journal=J.

Except for its role as a proteinase inhibitor, however, the pharmacological action of pepstatin A upon cells remain unclear. Pepstatin A suppresses receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)–induced osteoclast differentiation. Pepstatin A suppresses the formation of multinuclear osteoclasts dose-dependently. This inhibition of the formation only affected osteoclast cells, i.e., not osteoblast-like cells. Furthermore, pepstatin A also suppresses differentiation from pre-osteoclast cells to mononuclear osteoclast cells dose-dependently. This inhibition seems to be independent of the activities of proteinases such as cathepsin D, because the formation of osteoclasts was not suppressed with the concentration that inhibited the activity of cathepsin D. Cell signaling analysis indicated that the phosphorylation of ERK was inhibited in pepstatin A-treated cells, while the phosphorylation of IκB and Akt showed almost no change. Furthermore, pepstatin A decreased the expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1). These results suggest that pepstatin A suppresses the differentiation of osteoclasts through the blockade of ERK signaling and the inhibition of NFATc1 expression.

Pepstatin is practically insoluble in water, chloroform, ether, and benzene, however it can be dissolved in [[methanol]], [[ethanol]], and [[DMSO]] with [[acetic acid]],<ref>The Merck Index - An Encyclopedia of Chemicals, Drugs, and Biologicals (14th Edition - Version 14.4), Monograph '''07147''', {{ISBN|978-1-60119-491-6}}</ref> to between 1 and 5&nbsp;mg/ml.
