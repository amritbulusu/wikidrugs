'''Ambroxol''' is a secretolytic agent used in the treatment of [[respiratory|respiratory diseases]] associated with viscid or excessive [[mucus]]. Recently, a hypothesis suggested that it may have a potential role in treatment of Paget's disease of bone, Parkinsonism and other common autophagy-mediated aging diseases <ref>Numan M (2017) Ambroxol hydrochloride, a chaperone therapy for Paget’s disease of bone and other common autophagy-mediated aging diseases?. Int Clin Med 1: DOI: 10.15761/ICM.1000107, https://oatext.com/ambroxol-hydrochloride-a-chaperone-therapy-for-pagets-disease-of-bone-and-other-common-autophagy-mediated-aging-diseases.php#Article</ref> It is the active ingredient of Mucosolvan, Mucobrox, Mucol, Lasolvan, Mucoangin, Surbronc, Ambolar, and Lysopain. The substance is a mucoactive [[drug]] with several properties including secretolytic and [[secretomotoric]] actions that restore the physiological clearance mechanisms of the [[respiratory tract]], which play an important role in the body’s natural defence mechanisms. It stimulates [[Biosynthesis|synthesis]] and release of [[surfactant]] by type II [[pneumocytes]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Cell-specific modulation of surfactant proteins by ambroxol treatment|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0041008X04003552|journal = Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology|date = 2005-02-15|pages = 27–35|volume = 203|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.taap.2004.07.015|first = Carola|last = Seifart|first2 = Ursula|last2 = Clostermann|first3 = Ulf|last3 = Seifart|first4 = Bernd|last4 = Müller|first5 = Claus|last5 = Vogelmeier|first6 = Peter|last6 = von Wichert|first7 = Heinz|last7 = Fehrenbach}}</ref><ref name="Fois 628–637">{{Cite journal|title = A new role for an old drug: Ambroxol triggers lysosomal exocytosis via pH-dependent Ca2+ release from acidic Ca2+ stores|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0143416015001621|journal = Cell Calcium|doi = 10.1016/j.ceca.2015.10.002|first = Giorgio|last = Fois|first2 = Nina|last2 = Hobi|first3 = Edward|last3 = Felder|first4 = Andreas|last4 = Ziegler|first5 = Pika|last5 = Miklavc|first6 = Paul|last6 = Walther|first7 = Peter|last7 = Radermacher|first8 = Thomas|last8 = Haller|first9 = Paul|last9 = Dietl|volume=58|pages=628–637}}</ref> Surfactant acts as an anti-glue factor by reducing the adhesion of mucus to the [[bronchial]] wall, in improving its transport and in providing protection against [[infection]] and irritating agents.<ref>{{citation |vauthors=Sanderson RJ, etal |title=Morphological and physical basis for lung surfactant action|journal=Respir Phys|year=1976|volume=27|issue=3|pages=379–92|pmid=989610|doi=10.1016/0034-5687(76)90066-9}}</ref><ref>{{citation |vauthors=Kido H, etal |title=Secretory leukoprotease inhibitor and pulmonary surfactant serve as principal defenses against influenza A virus infection in the airway and chemical agents up-regulating their levels may have therapeutic potential.|journal=Biol Chem|date=Nov 2004|volume=385|issue=11|pages=1029–34|pmid=15576322|doi=10.1515/bc.2004.133|url=https://zenodo.org/record/997244}}</ref> Ambroxol is often administered as an active ingredient in cough syrup.

Ambroxol is indicated as "secretolytic therapy in bronchopulmonary diseases associated with abnormal mucus secretion and impaired mucus transport. It promotes mucus clearance, facilitates expectoration and eases [[productive cough]], allowing patients to breathe freely and deeply".<ref>{{citation|authors=Malerba M, Ragnoli B.|title=Ambroxol in the 21st century: pharmacological and clinical update|journal=Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol.|date=August 2008|volume=4|issue=8|pages=1119–29|doi=10.1517/17425255.4.8.1119|pmid=18680446}}</ref>

There are many different formulations developed since the first marketing authorisation in 1978. Ambroxol is available as [[cough syrup|syrup]], [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]], [[pastilles]], dry powder [[sachet]]s, inhalation solution, drops and [[ampules]] as well as [[effervescent tablets]].

Ambroxol also provides pain relief in [[acute sore throat]]. Pain in sore throat is the hallmark of acute [[pharyngitis]].<ref name="pmid19137906">{{citation |vauthors=de Mey C, etal |title=Efficacy and safety of ambroxol lozenges in the treatment of acute uncomplicated sore throat|journal=Arzneimittelforschung|year=2008|volume=58|issue=11|pages=557–68|doi=10.1055/s-0031-1296557|pmid=19137906}}</ref> Sore throat is usually caused by a [[viral infection]]. The infection is self limited and the patient recovers normally after a few days. What is most bothering for the patient is the continuous pain in the throat maximized when the patient is swallowing. The main goal of treatment is thus to reduce pain. The main property of Ambroxol for treating sore throat is the local [[anaesthetic]] effect, described first in the late 1970s,<ref>{{citation|authors=Püschmann S, Engelhorn R.|title=Pharmakologische Untersuchungen des Bromhexin-Metaboliten Ambroxol (Pharmacological study on the bromhexine-metabolite ambroxol)|journal=Arzneimittelforschung|year=1978|volume=28|issue=5a|pages=889–98|pmid=581987}}</ref><ref>{{citation|authors=Klier KF, Papendick U.|title=Die lokalanaesthetische Wirkung von NA-872-haltigen Augentropfen (The local anesthetic effect of NA872-containing eyedrops)|journal=[[Medizinische Monatsschrift für Pharmazeuten|Med Monatsschr.]]|year=1977|volume=31|issue=12|pages=575–8|pmid=593223}}</ref> but explained and confirmed in more recent work.

Ambroxol is a potent inhibitor of the [[neuron]]al [[Na+ channel]]s.<ref>{{citation|author=Weiser T.|title=Comparison of the effects of four Na+ channel analgesics on TTX-resistant Na+ currents in rat sensory neurons and recombinant Nav1.2 channels|journal=Neurosci Lett.|year=2006|volume=395|issue=3|pages=179–84|doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2005.10.058|pmid=16293367}}</ref> This property led to the development of a [[Throat lozenge|lozenge]] containing 20&nbsp;mg of ambroxol. Many state-of-the-art clinical studies<ref name="pmid19137906"/> have demonstrated the efficacy of Ambroxol in relieving pain in acute sore throat, with a rapid onset of action, with its effect lasting at least three hours. Ambroxol is also [[anti-inflammatory]], reducing redness in a sore throat.

Ambroxol has recently been shown to increase activity of the lysosomal enzyme [[glucocerebrosidase]].  Because of this it may be a useful therapeutic agent for both Gaucher disease and Parkinson's disease.<ref>{{citation|authors=Alisdair McNeill|title=Ambroxol improves lysosomal biochemistry in glucocerebrosidase mutation-linked Parkinson disease cells|journal=Brain|year=2014|volume=137|issue=5|pages=1481–1495|pmid=24574503|doi=10.1093/brain/awu020|display-authors=etal|pmc=3999713}}</ref>

It was also recently shown that Ambroxol triggers exocytosis of lysosomes by releasing calcium from acidic cellular calcium stores. This occurs by diffusion of Ambroxol into lysosomes and lysosomal pH neutralization.<ref name="Fois 628–637"/> This mechanism is most likely responsible for the mucolytic effects of the drug, but may also explain the reported activity in Gaucher and Parkinson's disease.

==Side effects==
Field tests to date have not uncovered specific contraindications of Ambroxol. However, caution is suggested for patients with gastric ulceration, and usage during the first trimester of pregnancy is not recommended.<ref>[http://www.drugs.com/ambroxol.html] Drugs.com, ''Ambroxol'', accessed 21 January 2014</ref>
