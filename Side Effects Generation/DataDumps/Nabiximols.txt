'''Nabiximols''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]],<ref>United States Adopted Names Council: [http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/365/nabiximols.pdf Statement on a nonproprietary name]</ref> trade name '''Sativex''') is a specific extract of ''[[Cannabis]]'' that was approved as a [[botanical drug]] in the United Kingdom in 2010 as a mouth spray to alleviate [[neuropathic pain]], [[spasticity]], [[overactive bladder]], and other symptoms of [[multiple sclerosis]]; it was developed by the UK company [[GW Pharmaceuticals]].<ref>UK Medicines Online [http://www.ukmi.nhs.uk/applications/ndo/record_view_open.asp?newDrugID=3919 Nabiximols]  Page accessed Feb 3, 2016</ref><ref>Multiple Sclerosis Trust. October 2014 [http://www.mstrust.org.uk/information/publications/factsheets/sativex.jsp Sativex (nabiximols) - factsheet]</ref> The drug is a pharmaceutical product standardised in composition, formulation, and dose.  Its principal active cannabinoid components are the cannabinoids: [[tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC) and [[cannabidiol]] (CBD). Each spray delivers a dose of 2.7&nbsp;mg THC and 2.5&nbsp;mg CBD.

In May 2003 GW Pharmaceuticals and [[Bayer]] entered into an exclusive marketing agreement for GW’s cannabis-based medicinal extract product, to be marketed under the brand name Sativex. "Bayer has obtained exclusive rights to market Sativex in the UK. In addition, Bayer has the option for a limited period to negotiate the marketing rights in other countries in European Union and selected other countries around the world."

In April 2011, GW licensed to [[Novartis]] the rights to commercialise nabiximols in Asia (excluding China and Japan), Africa and the Middle East (excluding Israel).<ref>{{cite news|publisher=The Telegraph|title=GW signs Sativex cannabis-based drug deal with Novartis |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/pharmaceuticalsandchemicals/8443914/GW-signs-Sativex-cannabis-based-drug-deal-with-Novartis.html|date=11 April 2011|accessdate=12 July 2012}}</ref>

==Availability==
In June 2010, the [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] of the United Kingdom licensed nabiximols as a prescription-only medicine for the treatment of spasticity due to multiple sclerosis. This regulatory authorization represents the world's first full regulatory approval for the medicine. The spray is being marketed in the UK by Bayer Schering Pharma. Many people with MS cannot receive nabiximols due to local [[National Health Service]] (NHS) resistance to its funding;<ref>{{cite news|title=Sussex MS sufferers call for drug funding |url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/9064713.Sussex_MS_sufferers_call_for_drug_funding/|last=Ryan|first=Siobhan|accessdate=8 June 2011|newspaper=Argus (Sussex,UK)|date=4 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Sativex rejected by healthcare provider|work=Lincolnshire|date=20 June 2011|url=http://www.thisislincolnshire.co.uk/Cannabis-based-MS-drug-rejected-NHS-Lincolnshire/story-12801496-detail/story.html|accessdate=20 June 2011}}</ref> but, in August 2014, the NHS in Wales agreed to fund Sativex for people with multiple sclerosis.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wales NHS to offer MS cannabis drug Sativex |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-28810407|accessdate=18 August 2014|date=15 August 2014}}</ref>

Nabiximols was also approved in Spain for MS spasticity in the second half of 2010 and was launched in that country in March 2011. It was approved in the Czech Republic in April 2011, in Germany in May 2011, in Denmark in June 2011 and in Sweden in January 2012 to people with MS who have not responded adequately to other medication  for spasticity.<ref>[http://www.lakemedelsverket.se/malgrupp/Halso---sjukvard/Monografier-varderingar/Humanlakemedel-/Sativex-nabiximols/ Sativex (nabiximols), Swedish Medical Products Agency]</ref>  It has also been recommended for approval in Italy and Austria with formal approvals expected in these countries during 2011. In Spain and other European markets (excluding the UK), nabiximols will be marketed by [[Almirall]].

In Canada, nabiximols has been approved by [[Health Canada]] for the treatment of MS spasticity. It has also received a licence with conditions (NOC/c) for two additional uses: as adjunctive treatment for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis,<ref>GW Pharmaceuticals. "[http://www.gwpharm.com/Multiple-Sclerosis.aspx Multiple Sclerosis]". Accessed 24 July 2011.</ref> and also for pain due to cancer.<ref>GW Pharmaceuticals.

Nabiximols is available in a number of countries as an unlicensed medicine, which enables doctors to prescribe the product to people who they consider may benefit. The product has been exported from the UK to a total of 28 countries to date.

In February 2007, GW and [[Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co.|Otsuka Pharmaceutical]] announced an exclusive agreement for Otsuka to develop and market the drug in the United States.  The first large scale US Phase IIb trial, Spray Trial, for people with cancer  reported positive results in March 2010. GW and Otsuka have now commenced the Phase III development of nabiximols in [[cancer pain]].

In December 2012, Sativex was approved in [[Poland]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Olszewska|first1=Dorota|last2=Kidawa Michał|title=Sativex - lek z marihuany|url=http://www.kbpn.gov.pl/portal?id=2451557|publisher=Krajowe Biuro Do Spraw Przeciwdziałania Narkomanii}}</ref>

In 2013, France legalized the use of cannabinoids in medicine, Sativex is the first one to be sold under prescription.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/10/france-marijuana-based-drug-legalizes-multiple-sclerosis_n_4575780.html | title=France Legalizes Marijuana-Based Drug To Treat Multiple Sclerosis | publisher=HunffingtonPost | accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref> Nevertheless, at least until June 2016, this drug was never actually sold in pharmacies there.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sciencesetavenir.fr/sante/20160405.OBS7854/cannabis-therapeutique-pourquoi-le-sativex-n-est-il-toujours-pas-vendu-en-france.html | title=Cannabis thérapeutique : pourquoi le Sativex n'est-il toujours pas vendu en France ? | publisher=Sciences et Avenir | accessdate=6 June 2016}}</ref>

==Effectiveness==
Of the two preliminary Phase III studies investigating the treatment of people with MS, one showed a reduction of spasticity of 1.2 points on the 0–10 points rating scale (versus 0.6 points under [[placebo]]), the other showed a reduction of 1.0 versus 0.8 points. Only the first study reached statistical significance. The Phase III approval study consisted of a run-in phase where the response of individuals to the drug was determined. The responders (42% of subjects) showed a significant effect in the second, placebo controlled, phase of the trial.<ref name="Schubert">Schubert-Zsilavecz, M, Wurglics, M, ''Neue Arzneimittel 2011/2012'' {{de icon}}</ref> A 2009 meta-analysis of six studies found large variations of effectiveness, with a – statistically non-significant – trend towards a reduction of spasticity.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Whole plant cannabis extracts in the treatment of spasticity in multiple sclerosis: a systematic review|first1=Shaheen E|last1=Lakhan|first2=Marie|last2=Rowland|journal=BMC Neurol|year=2009|volume=9|page=59|pmid=19961570|pmc=2793241|doi=10.1186/1471-2377-9-59}}</ref> A systematic review in 2014 by the American Academy of Neurology found that nabiximols was 'probably effective' for spasticity, pain, and urinary dysfunction, but wasn't supported for tremor.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Systematic review: efficacy and safety of medical marijuana in selected neurologic disorders: report of the Guideline Development Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology|journal = Neurology|date = 2014-04-29|issn = 1526-632X|pmc = 4011465|pmid = 24778283|pages = 1556–1563|volume = 82|issue = 17|doi = 10.1212/WNL.0000000000000363|first = Barbara S.|last = Koppel|first2 = John C.

==Side effects==
In early clinical trials, nabiximols has generally been well tolerated.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Wade D, Makela P, Robson P, House H, Bateman C |title=Do cannabis-based medicinal extracts have general or specific effects on symptoms in multiple sclerosis?

No investigations regarding the potential for [[Substance dependence|dependence]] are available, but such a potential is unlikely considering the pharmacological properties of the two components.<ref name="Schubert" />

== Licensing ==
{{Unbalanced|section|date=October 2012}}
GW Pharmaceuticals were issued a unique license to cultivate cannabis for the manufacturing of Sativex in the UK, granting them the sole legal right to research in aerosolized cannabis derived therapeutics, which in April 2013 became commercially viable when the UK Government scheduled the Sativex formulation to part IV of the UK Drugs Act.<ref>http://www.gwpharm.com/GW%20Pharmaceuticals%20cannabinoid-medicine%20Sativex%20moved%20to%20Schedule%204%20of%20UK%20Drugs%20Act.aspx</ref>
