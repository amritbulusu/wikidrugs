'''Pantoprazole''', first sold under the brand name '''Protonix''', is used for short-term treatment of [[erosive esophagitis]] associated with [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] (GERD), maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis, and pathological hypersecretory conditions including [[Zollinger–Ellison syndrome]].<ref name=":02" />

Some common side effects of pantoprazole use in adults include: headache, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, flatulence, dizziness, and [[arthralgia|joint pain]] (>2%).<ref name=":02" /> Use of pantoprazole for a long period of time may lead to chronic inflammation of stomach lining or [[atrophic gastritis]], [[Vitamin B12 deficiency|vitamin B-12 deficiency]], and low magnesium.<ref name=":02" /><ref name=":122"/>

Pantoprazole is a [[Proton-pump inhibitor|proton pump inhibitor]] drug that inhibits [[gastric acid]] secretion. It works on gastric [[parietal cell]]s to irreversibly inhibit [[Hydrogen potassium ATPase|(H+/K+)-ATPase]] function and suppress the production of gastric acid.<ref name=":02" /><ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|title = Proton Pump Inhibitors|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00003495-199856030-00002|journal = Drugs|date = 2012-11-29|issn = 0012-6667|pages = 307–335|volume = 56|issue = 3|doi = 10.2165/00003495-199856030-00002|pmid = 9777309|first = Paul|last = Richardson|first2 = Christopher J.|last2 = Hawkey|first3 = Dr William A.|last3 = Stack}}</ref> It was first sold in 1994 in Germany and became available as a [[generic medication]] in 2010.<ref name=brands/>

==Medical uses==
Pantoprazole is used for short-term treatment of erosion and ulceration of the esophagus for adults and pediatric patients 5 years of age and older caused by [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]].<ref name=":02" /> It can be used as a maintenance therapy for long-term use after initial response is obtained, but there have not been any controlled studies about the use of pantoprazole past a duration of 12 months.<ref name=":02" /> Pantoprazole may also be used in combination with antibiotics to treat ulcers caused by ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]''[[Helicobacter pylori|.]]<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Eradication of H. pylori with Pantoprazole, Clarithromycin, and Metronidazole in Duodenal Ulcer Patients: A Head-to-Head Comparison Between Two Regimens of Different Duration|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1523-5378.2000.00006.x/abstract|journal = Helicobacter|date = 2000-03-01|issn = 1523-5378|pages = 41–51|volume = 5|issue = 1|doi = 10.1046/j.1523-5378.2000.00006.x|pmid = 10672051|first = Hans-Gerd|last = Dammann|first2 = Ulrich R.|last2 = Fölsch|first3 = Eckhart G.|last3 = Hahn|first4 = Detlef-Hasso|last4 = Von Kleist|first5 = Hans-Ulrich|last5 = Klör|first6 = Thomas|last6 = Kirchner|first7 = Sonja|last7 = Strobel|first8 = Manfred|last8 = Kist}}</ref> It can also be used for long-term treatment of [[Zollinger–Ellison syndrome|Zollinger-Ellison syndrome]].<ref name=":02" />

=== Pregnancy ===
U.S.A Pregnancy Category B: In reproductive studies using doses largely greater than the recommended doses performed on rats and rabbits, there was no evident harm on the development of the baby.<ref name=":02" />

=== Breast feeding ===
Pantoprazole has been found to pass through the breast milk. However, in rodent cancer studies, pantoprazole has been shown to potentially cause tumor growth. The clinical relevance of the finding is unknown, but risks and benefits are recommended for consideration in determining the use of therapy for the mother and child.<ref name=":02" />

=== Children ===
Pantoprazole is only indicated for the short-term treatment of [[erosive esophagitis]] in children ages 5 and older; and the safety and effectiveness of pantoprazole have only been established in the treatment of erosive esophagitis in children.<ref name=":02" />

=== Elderly ===
The incidence of adverse effects occurring in patients aged 65 years and older were similar to those in patients aged 65 years and less.<ref name=":02" />

==Adverse effects==
* Infection: Stomach acid plays a role in killing ingested bacteria. Use of pantoprazole may increase the chance of developing infections such as pneumonia, particularly in hospitalized patients.<ref>{{cite journal|last1 = Herzig|first1 = SJ|last2 = Doughty|first2 = C|last3 = Lahoti|first3 = S|last4 = Marchina|first4 = S|last5 = Sanan|first5 = N|last6 = Feng|first6 = W|last7 = Kumar|first7 = S|title = Acid-suppressive medication use in acute stroke and hospital-acquired pneumonia.|journal = Annals of Neurology|date = November 2014|volume = 76|issue = 5|pages = 712–8|pmid = 25164323|doi = 10.1002/ana.24262|pmc=4214881}}</ref>

==Interactions==
* Acidity: Due to its effect of reducing stomach acidity, use of pantoprazole can affect absorption of drugs that are pH-sensitive such as [[ampicillin]] esters, [[ketoconazole]], [[atazanavir]], [[Iron|iron salts]], [[amphetamine]] and [[Mycophenolate mofetil hydrochloride|mycophenolate mofetil]].<ref name=":02" />

==Pharmacology==
[[File:Pantoprazole 20mg.jpg|thumbnail|left|Wyeth pantoprazole 20-mg]]
The mechanism of action of pantoprazole is to inhibit the final step in gastric acid production.<ref name=":02" /> In the gastric parietal cell of the stomach, pantoprazole covalently binds to the H+/K+ ATP pump to inhibit gastric acid and basal acid secretion.<ref name=":02" /> The covalent binding prevents acid secretion of up to 24 hours and longer.<ref name=":02" />

Pantoprazole is metabolized in the liver by the [[cytochrome P450]] system.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00042737-199610001-00005 | author = Meyer, U A  | title = Metabolic interactions of the proton-pump inhibitors lansoprazole, omeprazole and pantoprazole with other drugs | journal = European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology  | year = 1996 | volume = 8 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = S21–25}}</ref> Metabolism mainly consists of [[demethylation]] by [[CYP2C19]] followed by [[sulfation]]. Another metabolic pathway is [[oxidation]] by [[CYP3A4]]. Pantoprazole metabolites are not thought to have any pharmacological significance. It is usually given with a [[Prokinetic drugs|prokinetic drug]] because of inactivity in the acidic environment of the stomach. Pantoprazole binds irreversibly to H+K+ATPase ([[proton pumps]]) to suppress the secretion of acid. Due to irreversible binding of the pumps, new pumps have to be made before acid production can be resumed.<ref name=":0" /> The drug's plasma half-life is about 2 hours.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Novel Approaches to Inhibition of Gastric Acid Secretion|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11894-010-0149-5|journal = Current Gastroenterology Reports|date = 2010-10-06|issn = 1522-8037|pmc = 2974194|pmid = 20924727|pages = 437–447|volume = 12|issue = 6|doi = 10.1007/s11894-010-0149-5|first = George|last = Sachs|first2 = Jai Moo|last2 = Shin|first3 = Richard|last3 = Hunt}}</ref>

==History==
Pantoprazole was discovered by scientists at Byk Gulden, a subsidiary of [[Altana]]; the [[drug discovery]] program started in 1980 and produced pantoprazole in 1985 - the compound was actually created by chemists working on scaleup of a different chemical that had been chosen as a development candidate.<ref name=SennBilfinger>{{cite book|last1=Senn-Bilfinger|first1=Jörg|last2=Sturm|first2=Ernst|editor1-last=Fischer|editor1-first=János|editor2-last=Ganellin|editor2-first=C.
