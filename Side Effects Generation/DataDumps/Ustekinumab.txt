It is manufactured in the Netherlands. It is directed against [[interleukin 12]] and [[interleukin 23]], naturally occurring proteins that regulate the immune system and immune-mediated inflammatory disorders.<ref name="pmid17761156">{{cite journal |vauthors=Reddy M, Davis C, Wong J, Marsters P, Pendley C, Prabhakar U |title=Modulation of CLA, IL-12R, CD40L, and IL-2Ralpha expression and inhibition of IL-12- and IL-23-induced cytokine secretion by CNTO 1275 |journal=Cell.

==Medical uses==
Ustekinumab is used to treat [[psoriasis]]. This includes [[psoriatic arthritis]] and when it affects the skin.<ref name=AHFS2017>{{cite web|title=Ustekinumab|url=https://www.drugs.com/monograph/ustekinumab.html|publisher=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate= 8 January 2017}}</ref> It also was approved to treat Crohn's disease in September, 2016.

==Mechanism of action==
Ustekinumab (CNTO 1275) is designed to interfere with the triggering of the body's [[Inflammation|inflammatory response]] through the suppression of certain [[cytokines]].  Specifically, it blocks [[interleukin]] [[Interleukin 12|IL-12]] and [[Interleukin 23|IL-23]] which help activate certain [[T cell|T-cells]]. It binds to the [[Interleukin-12 subunit beta|p-40]] subunit of both [[Interleukin 12|IL-12]] and [[Interleukin 23|IL-23]] so that they subsequently cannot bind to their receptors.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Koutruba|first1=N|last2=Emer|first2=J|last3=Lebwohl|first3=M|title=Review of ustekinumab, an interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 inhibitor used for the treatment of plaque psoriasis.|journal=Therapeutics and clinical risk management|date=15 April 2010|volume=6|pages=123–41|pmid=20421912|pmc=2857612}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
According to information provided by Centocor, maker of one medication based on ustekinumab, their version of the drug is associated with several types of serious adverse effects. These include an increased risk of infection, such as by [[tuberculosis]] and an increased risk of certain types of [[cancer]]. As with some other immunosuppressant drugs like [[ciclosporin]], the brain swelling of [[posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome]] is a risk. The pharmaceutical company also reports serious [[allergic reaction]] as a possible side effect. More common side effects are [[upper respiratory infection]], [[headache]], and [[tiredness]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Important Safety Information |date= |work=STELARA® (ustekinumab) |publisher=Janssen Biotech |url=http://www.stelarainfo.com/safety}}</ref>

Clinical trials have shown that subcutaneous ustekinumab was generally well tolerated. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were of mild severity.<ref name="ustekinu">{{cite journal |vauthors=Weber J, Keam SJ |title=Ustekinumab |journal=BioDrugs |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=53–61 |year=2009 |pmid=19344192 |doi=10.2165/00063030-200923010-00006 |url=http://adisonline.com/biodrugs/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2009&issue=23010&article=00006&type=abstract }}</ref>

== Pregnancy ==
It is unknown if the medication is safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

==History==
{{As of|January 2007}}, there were 5 NIH-listed research studies involving CNTO 1275 on a multinational basis, including 3 Phase II and 2 Phase III trials.  Three studies were focused on patients with psoriasis, one on psoriatic arthritis, and one on multiple sclerosis.

On December 4, 2007, a [[Biologic License Application]] (BLA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was filed by Centocor and [[Janssen-Cilag]] International (collaborator) has submitted a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMEA).

On November 21, 2008, the European Medicines Agency’s (EMEA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion for ustekinumab for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who failed to respond to other systemic therapies.<ref name="centocor.com">Centocor 12/19/08 Press Release, http://www.centocor.com/centocor/i/press_releases/FDA_ISSUES_COMPLETE_RESPONSE_LETTER_TO_CENTOCOR_FOR_USTEKINUMAB_BIOLOGIC_LICENSE_APPLICATION_</ref>

==Approvals and indications==
Since 2009, Ustekinumab is approved in Canada, Europe and the United States to treat moderate to severe [[plaque psoriasis]].<ref>[http://news.idsk.com/viewer/story.php?CLIENT=INFOMAILER&NEWSID=prn121520081223240607 Medarex to Receive Milestone Payment for Approval of STELARA(TM) (Ustekinumab) for the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis]</ref> On September 24, 2013, the [[FDA]] approved the use of ustekinumab for the treatment of [[psoriatic arthritis]].

On December 12, 2008 the Canadian Health Authority approved the use of ustekinumab for the treatment of chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy.<ref name="centocor.com"/>

The FDA approved the drug on September 25, 2009 for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.<ref>[http://www.empr.com/stelara-approved-for-moderate-to-severe-psoriasis/article/149760/ Stelara approved for moderate to severe psoriasis. Sept 2009]</ref>

The FDA approved the drug in September 2016 for the treatment of Crohn's disease.

==Clinical studies==
In September 2008, Centocor released result of a study comparing [[etanercept]] and ustekinumab.  The etanercept group received subcutaneous injections of the drug twice weekly for 12-weeks while the ustekinumab group received 2 injections, one-month apart, of either 90 or 45 milligrams.  At twelve weeks, psoriatic plaques were reduced by at least three-quarters in 68% of the low-dose ustekinumab group and 74% of the high-dose group.  Both groups fared better than the etanercept group, 57% of whom saw such improvement.  Dr. Alan Menter, chairman of psoriasis research at [[Baylor University|Baylor Research Institute]] said of the results, "now we have a drug that will be used less frequently ... with a significant increase in effectiveness.  These results are as good as we've seen in psoriasis."<ref>Johnson LL.
