'''Fluparoxan''' ('''GR50360A''') (+/-)-(trans)-5-fluoro-2,3,3a,9a-tetrahydro-1H-[1,4]benzodioxino[2,3-c]pyrrole hydrochloride hemihydrate is a potent [[alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] (pK<sub>B</sub> = 7.9) with excellent α<sub>2</sub>/α<sub>1</sub> selectivity (2630 fold), and is the only well-studied a<sub>2</sub> antagonist in its structural family which does not antagonize any variant of the [[imidazoline receptor]].<ref name="pmid26996616">{{cite journal | author = Borthwick AD | title = Fluparoxan: A Comprehensive Review of its Discovery, Adrenergic and CNS activity and treatment of Cognitive Dysfunction in central Neurodegenerative diseases | journal = Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry | volume = 17 | issue = 7 | pages = 572-582 | date= 2017 | pmid = 26996616 | doi = 10.2174/1389557516666160321115041 | url =  }}</ref><ref name="pmid8770384">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kitchin J, Borthwick AD, Brodie AC, Cherry PC, Crame AJ, Pipe AJ, Procopiou PA, Seaman MA, Turnbull JP | title = Synthesis of Benzodioxinopyrroles as selective α <sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor antagonists | journal = Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 3 | issue = 12 | pages = 1595–1603 | date= December 1995 | pmid = 8770384 | doi = 10.1016/0968-0896(95)00143-3 | url =  }}</ref>
It was shown to possess central α<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor antagonist activity after oral doses in man and was patented as an [[antidepressant]] by '''Glaxo''' in the early 1980s, but its development was discontinued when the compound failed to show a clear clinical advantage over existing therapies.<ref name="pmid26996616" />

==Pharmacology==

Fluparoxan showed α<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors antagonist activity in vivo in several animal species.<ref name="pmid1677298" /> In the conscious mouse, fluparoxan was effective by the oral route in preventing [[clonidine]]-induced [[hypothermia]] and [[antinociception]].  While in the rat the marked impairment of rotarod performance were prevented dose-dependently by fluparoxan.  Fluparoxan, orally prevented agonist UK-14304 induced sedation and [[bradycardia]] in a dose-related fashion in the dog.  Fluparoxan has been shown to possess central α<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor antagonist activity after both single and repeated oral doses in man, significantly attenuating all responses to the agonist clonidine (growth hormone secretion, bradycardia, [[hypotension]], [[xerostomia]]) apart from the measures of sedation.<ref name="pmid7669482">{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnson MA, Blackwell CP, Smith J | title = Antagonism of the effects of clonidine by the alpha 2‐adrenoceptor antagonist, fluparoxan | journal = British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 39 | issue = 5 | pages = 477–483| date= May 1995 | pmid = 7669482 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2125.1995.tb04483.x | pmc=1365053}}</ref>

Fluparoxan has shown positive effects in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia patients when orally dosed with fluparoxan,<ref name="pmid26996616" /> and in the treatment of central neurodegenerative disorders in models of Alzheimer's disease where it prevented age-related decline in spatial working memory in [[transgenic mice]], although it had no effect in other memory tasks such as object recognition or the [[Morris water maze]] and occurred in the absence of obvious concomitant change in pathology such as [[β-amyloid]] plaque load and [[astrocytosis]].<ref name="pmid20850464">{{cite journal |vauthors=Scullion GA, Kendall DA, Marsden CA, Sunter D, Pardon MC | title = Chronic treatment with the α <sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor antagonist fluparoxan prevents age-related deficits in spatial working memory in APP× PS1 transgenic mice without altering β-amyloid plaque load or astrocytosis | journal = Neuropharmacology | volume = 60 | issue = 2 | pages = 223–234 | date= March 2011 | pmid = 20850464 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2010.09.002 | url =  }}</ref>

The individual [[chiral]] isomers '''7''' (+) 3a''R'',9a''R'' and '''8''' (-) 3a''S'',9a''S'' of fluparoxan both had comparable levels of α<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors antagonist potency and α<sub>2</sub>/α<sub>1</sub> selectivity to [[racemic]] fluparoxan '''6''' (±) ''rel'' 3a''R'',9a''R'' in vitro and a similar potency in vivo in reversing the hypothermia induced in mice by clonidine.<ref name="pmid1677298"   />

==Pharmacokinetics==

Fluparoxan has rat and human protein binding of 81-92% and 95% respectively.  Fluparoxan shows high in vitro permeability in MCDK (Papp nm/s =2500) and [[Caco-2]] (Papp nm/s =2000) cells which correlates well with the known high oral intestinal absorption (100%) in humans.<ref name="pmid2387889">{{cite journal | author = Gristwood WE | title = Determination of fluparoxan (GR50360) in plasma by gas chromatography | journal = Journal of Chromatography B | volume = 527 | issue =  | pages = 436–440 | date= December 1990 | pmid = 2387889 | doi = 10.1016/S0378-4347(00)82128-3 | url =  }}</ref>
Fluparoxan is well absorbed following oral dosing in all animals. Clearance was largely metabolic, with both oral and intravenous doses being excreted mainly via the urine (> 90%, of administered dose), chiefly as phase II metabolites ([[sulphamic acid]] and carbamoyI [[glucuronide]] conjugates).<ref name="pmid9058530">{{cite journal |vauthors=Beresford AP, Ellis WJ, Ayrton J, Johnson MA, Lewis DF | title = Cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) induction in rat and man by the benzodioxino derivative, fluparoxan | journal = Xenobiotica | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 159–173| date= January 1997 | pmid = 9058530 | doi = 10.1080/004982597240668 | url =  }}</ref> Fluparoxan has high oral [[bioavailability]] (100%) and a long duration of action (2hr) in the rat,<ref name="pmid26996616" /> which accounts for its similar potency seen by both the oral and intravenous routes of administration in this species.<ref name="pmid1677298"   />  The excellent pharmacokinetics exhibited by fluparoxan in animals also translated into man <ref name="pmid26996616" /> where it has a superior bioavailability (97%) and longer duration of action (6-7hrs).

==Metabolism==

Fluparoxan was not metabolised by human [[cytochrome P450]] enzymes CYP 1A and CYP 2A, and was found not to be a mutagen in cultured human peripheral [[lymphocytes]] and did not cause gene mutation when administered to Chinese hamster [[fibroblasts]] in culture.<ref name="pmid9058530"/> No mutagenic potential was identified in microbiological mutagenicity tests including a fluctuation test with S9 activation. No hydroxylated metabolites were identified after incubation with rat liver [[microsomes]] (S9) or in rat urine following oral dosing.<ref name="pmid26996616" />  The compound was well tolerated on repeat oral administration to rat (≤ 200&nbsp;mg /kg/day) and dog (≤ 80&nbsp;mg/kg/day) for 12 months.

==Chemistry==

Racemic (±) fluparoxan '''6''' is a white crystalline powder as the hydrochloride hemihydrate m.p.&nbsp;245&nbsp;°C.<ref name="pmid26996616" />   It is a mixture of two [[enantiomers]] and is moderately lipophilic (log P = 1.2) with good solubility 80&nbsp;mg/mL in water at 25&nbsp;°C. The compound is very stable in the solid state and its bioavailability from tablet formulation is 85% and absorption is rapid.<ref name="pmid26996616" />

==Synthesis==

Racemic (±) fluparoxan '''6''' was first synthesised by a convergent route,<ref name="pmid26996616" /><ref name="pmid8770384" /> which involved converting the bis-benzyl ether of cis-butene-l,4-diol '''1''' into its epoxide '''2''' followed by acid catalyzed ring opening to a racemic-diol which was then converted into the racemic trans bis-tosylate '''3'''.  Coupling 3-fluorocatechol '''4''' with the racemic trans bis-tosylate '''3''' in the presence base gave on deprotection the benzodioxan diol '''5''' which was converted to racemic '''6''' via coupling its bis-mesylate to benzylamine followed by deprotection.<ref name="pmid26996616" /><ref name="pmid8770384" />
[[File:Synthesis of Fluparoxan.svg|center|700px|The Convergent Synthesis of Fluparoxan]]
The individual chiral isomers (+) '''7''' and (-) '''8''' of fluparoxan were originally prepared from the (+) and (-) isomers of [[diethyl tartrate]] via the corresponding chiral trans bis-tosylates in a convergent route similar to that shown in the synthesis of racemic fluparoxan.<ref name="pmid26996616" />

==History==

Although fluparoxan has been shown to possess central α<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor antagonist activity after both single and repeated oral doses in man, clinical evaluation in depression and its development for the treatment of male sexual dysfunction was discontinued in the early 1990s when the compound failed to show a clear clinical advantage over existing therapies. The same is true for other α<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor antagonists in depression and it is now generally agreed that the original hypothesis that blocking α<sub>2</sub>-presynaptic adrenoceptors to increase brain levels of noradrenalin is insufficient as a neurobiological basis for depressive disorders, with the true picture likely to be much more complex and heterogeneous, involving both [[monoaminergic]] and nonmonoaminergic players.<ref name="pmid18172175">{{cite journal |vauthors=Belmaker RH, Agam G | title = Major depressive disorder | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 358 | issue = 1 | pages = 55–68 | date= January 2008 | pmid = 18172175 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra073096 | url =  }}</ref> In contrast however, recent interest in fluparoxan has increased with its positive effects in treating cognitive dysfunction in central [[neurodegenerative diseases]].<ref name="pmid26996616" />
