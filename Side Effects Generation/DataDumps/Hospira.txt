==History==
[[Image:Hospira headquarters.JPG|thumb|right|Hospira corporate headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois]]
In January 2004, Abbott announced it was spinning off its hospital products division.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2004/01/26/story3.html|title=Abbott Labs to spin off unit|last=Higginbotham|first=Stacey|date=25 January 2004|publisher=Austin Business Journal}}</ref>

Hospira's name was picked by employee vote. The name is derived from the words hospital, spirit, inspire and the Latin word "spero," which means "hope."<ref name="about"/> Hospira became an independent company on Monday, May 3, 2004, with 14,000 employees, 14 manufacturing sites and an estimated $2.5 billion in annual sales.

In 2007, Hospira purchased Mayne Pharma Ltd., an Australian-based specialty injectable pharmaceuticals company, for $2.1 billion. The deal expanded Hospira's international reach and its presence in the oncology market.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2836166720070301|title=Hospira quarterly earnings rise 78 percent|date=28 February 2007|publisher=Reuters|first=Debra|last=Sherman}}</ref>

More recent acquisitions by Hospira include biotechnology business from Pliva-Croatia in 2009, the generic injectable pharmaceuticals business of [[Orchid Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals Ltd.]], a leading Indian pharmaceuticals company, for approximately $400 million, announced in late 2009 and completed in 2010;<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2009-12-16/news/28457975_1_hospira-generic-injectable-supply-active-pharmaceutical-ingredients/2009-12-17/news/27653053_1_hospira-injectable-orchid-chemical|title=US-based Hospira to Buy Orchid Chemical's Injectables Biz For $400 Mn|date=16 December 2009|publisher=The Economic Times}}</ref> Javelin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., maker of post-operative pain management drug Dyloject, for approximately $145 million, in 2010;<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9GL0Q781.htm|title=Hospira To Close $145M Javelin Deal This Week|date=29 June 2010|publisher=BusinessWeek|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026073645/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9GL0Q781.htm|archivedate=26 October 2012|df=}}</ref> and TheraDoc, a clinical informatics company that develops hospital surveillance systems, in 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/news/2009/12/hospira-acquires-theradoc-enhances-medication-saf.aspx|title=Hospira Acquires Theradoc, Enhances Medication Safety and Infection Management Offerings|date=2 December 2009|publisher=Infection Control Today}}</ref>

In 2011, Hospira's board chose Mike Ball, formerly president of Allergan, as Hospira's new CEO. Ball became CEO in March 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20110308/business/110309638/|title=Hospira Names Allergan's Michael Ball as CEO|date=8 March 2011|publisher=Daily Herald}}</ref> Hospira named John Staley its non-executive chairman with the retirement of former executive chairman Christopher Begley in January 2012. Begley had announced his retirement as Hospira's chief executive in August 2010, but had remained as executive chairman.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.marketwatch.com/2011-12-07/news/30959308_1_hospira-christopher-begley-chairman |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120707004812/http://articles.marketwatch.com/2011-12-07/news/30959308_1_hospira-christopher-begley-chairman |archivedate=2012-07-07 |df= }}</ref>

==Sodium thiopental production==
[[Sodium thiopental]] is an anesthetic discovered by Abbott Laboratories in the 1930s.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.aana.com/Resources.aspx?id=1730|title=History of Anesthesia with Emphasis on the Nurse Specialist|last=Thatcher|first=Virginia S.|year=1953|publisher=J.B. Lippincott|chapter=Chapter 7: Illegal or Legal?|chapterurl=http://www.aana.com/uploadedFiles/Resources/Archives_-_Library/Historical_Resources/Thatcher/0008CHP7.PDF}}</ref> Hospira manufactured the drug after splitting off from Abbott under the brand name Pentothal.  The [[WHO]] considers it an [[WHO Model List of Essential Medicines|essential drug]].  However, it is also used as part of the [[lethal injection]] protocol in many US states.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8028989/US-executions-on-hold-due-to-lethal-injection-drug-shortage.html|title=US executions on hold due to lethal injection drug shortage|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=27 September 2010|last=Allen|first=Nick|location=London}}</ref> Though Hospira has supplied these states with the drug, it has said, "we do not support the use of any of our products in capital punishment procedures."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39385026/ns/health-health_care/|title=Shortage of drug holds up some U.S. executions|last=Welsh-Huggins|first=Andrew|date=27 September 2010|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|agency=AP}}</ref>

{{wikinews|Final US manufacturer ceases production of lethal injection drug; executions delayed}}
On January 21, 2011, the company announced that it would stop producing sodium thiopental.  Hospira had recently moved production of the drug from a plant in [[North Carolina]] to a plant in [[Liscate]], [[Italy]].  However, the Italian government threatened to bar its export unless Hospira monitored the entire supply chain all the way to the end user in order to ensure it only used for medical purposes and not converted for use in executions.  The Italian constitution bans the use of capital punishment.  Company officials determined there was no way it could prevent sodium thiopental from being used in executions, and did not want to expose their employees to liability.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/22/us/22lethal.html|title=States Face Shortage of Key Lethal Injection Drug|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=21 January 2011|first1=Erik|last1=Eckholm|first2=Katie|last2=Zezima}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704754304576095980790129692?mod=WSJ_hp_LEADNewsCollection|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|title=Drug Halt Hinders Executions in the U.S.|date=January 22, 2011|last=Koppel|first=Nathan}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=175550&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1518610&highlight=Pentothal|title=Hospira - Investor Relations - Press Release|work=corporate-ir.net}}</ref>

==Legislation and litigation==

'''Oxaliplatin''': In August 2009, Hospira introduced a generic version of Sanofi-Aventis SA's (SNY) colon-cancer drug known generically as oxaliplatin and by the brand name Eloxatin, in the United States. In April 2010, Hospira announced a legal settlement with Sanofi-Aventis. Under the settlement terms, Hospira agreed to stop selling oxaliplatin injection in the United States by June 30, 2010, and can relaunch the product in the United States on Aug. 9, 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/sanofi-aventis-settles-additional-eloxatin-suits-2010-04-06//|title=Sanofi-Aventis Settles Additional Eloxatin Suits|date=6 April 2010|publisher=MarketWatch}}</ref>

'''Biosimilars''': In 2010, the U.S. Congress passed legislation that would allow the marketing of biosimilar drugs in the United States. The legislation would allow 12 years of data exclusivity for brand-name biologics. Some consumer groups, like AARP, oppose this provision, saying it would cause lack of access to the promise of such drugs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarp.org/community/AARPTN/journals/Helping_patients_not_prot/2296062|title=Home - AARP Online Community|work=aarp.org}}</ref>

==Infusion pump system firmware vulnerability disclosures==

In 2014-2015 two [[IT security|security researchers]] independently identified what were described as severe defects in Hospira's PCA system [[firmware]], the [[software]] controlling various of their drug infusion equipment (CVE-2015-3459<ref name="CVE1">{{cite web|url=https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-3459|title=NVD - Detail|work=nist.gov}}</ref> and further advisory ICSA-15-125-01B<ref name="DHS1">{{cite web|url=https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-15-125-01B|title=Hospira LifeCare PCA Infusion System Vulnerabilities (Update B) - ICS-CERT|work=us-cert.gov}}</ref>).
