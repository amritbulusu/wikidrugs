'''6-MAPDB''' ('''1-(2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-6-yl)-N-methylpropan-2-amine''') is a chemical compound which might be an entactogenic drug. It is structurally related to drugs like [[6-APDB]] and [[6-MAPB]], which have similar effects to MDMA and have been used as recreational drugs. 6-MAPDB has never been studied to determine its pharmacological activity, though it is the N-methyl derivative of 6-APDB which is known to be a [[selective serotonin releaser]].<ref name="pmid8246240">{{cite journal | vauthors = Monte AP, Marona-Lewicka D, Cozzi NV, Nichols DE | title = Synthesis and pharmacological examination of benzofuran, indan, and tetralin analogues of 3,4-(methylenedioxy)amphetamine | journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 36 | issue = 23 | pages = 3700â€“6 |date=November 1993 | pmid = 8246240 | doi = 10.1021/jm00075a027| url = }}</ref>

==Legality==
6-MAPDB was banned in the UK in June 2013 as a [[temporary class drug]] along with 9 other related compounds, despite having never been sold as a street drug itself. This was due to concerns that it would have similar effects to drugs such as [[6-APB]] that had been widely sold already, and 6-MAPDB might therefore be likely to become used recreationally also, if it were not banned preemptively.<ref name='ACMD report'>{{cite web | url = https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/temporary-class-drug-order-report-on-benzofury-and-nbome-compounds | title =Temporary class drug order on benzofury and NBOMe compounds - letter from ACMD | accessdate = 2013-07-11 | date = 4 Jun 2013 | publisher = UK Home Office}}</ref>
