<!-- Definitio and medical uses -->

==Medical uses==
It is given as a treatment for a variety of [[cancer]]s, including:
* [[Testicular cancer]]
* [[Breast cancer]]
* [[Lymphoma]] (Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin)
* [[Soft tissue sarcoma]]
* [[Osteosarcoma]] or [[bone tumor]]
* [[Lung cancer]]
* [[Cervical cancer]]
* [[Ovarian cancer]]

===Administration===
It is a white [[Powder (substance)|powder]] which, when prepared for use in [[chemotherapy]], becomes a clear, colorless fluid. The delivery is [[intravenous]].

Ifosfamide is often used in conjunction with [[mesna]] to avoid [[internal bleeding]] in the patient, in particular [[hemorrhagic cystitis]].

Ifosfamide is given quickly, and in some cases can be given as quickly as an hour.

==Side effects==
Hemorrhagic cystitis is rare when ifosfamide is given with mesna. A common and dose-limiting side effect is [[encephalopathy]] (brain dysfunction).<ref name=Ajithkumar/> It occurs in some form in up to 50% of people receiving the agent. The reaction is probably mediated by [[chloroacetaldehyde]], one of the breakdown products of the ifosfamide molecule, which has chemical properties similar to [[acetaldehyde]] and [[chloral hydrate]]. The symptoms of ifosfamide encephalopathy can range from mild (difficulty concentrating, fatigue), to moderate ([[delirium]], [[psychosis]]), to severe ([[Status epilepticus#Nonconvulsive|nonconvulsive status epilepticus]] or [[coma]]). In children, this can interfere with neurological development. Apart from the brain, ifosfamide can also affect peripheral nerves. The severity of the reaction can be classified according to either the [[National Cancer Institute]] or the Meanwell criteria (grade I-IV). Previous brain problems and low levels of [[albumin]] in the blood increase the likelihood of ifosfamide encephalopathy. In most cases, the reaction resolves spontaneously within 72 hours. If it develops during an infusion of the drug, discontinuing the infusion is advised. The most effective treatment for severe (grade III-IV) encephalopathy is an intravenous solution of [[methylene blue]], which appears to shorten the duration of encephalopathy; the exact mechanism of action of methylene blue is unclear. In some cases, methylene blue may be used as a prophylaxis before further doses of ifosfamide are administered. Other treatments include albumin and [[thiamine]], and [[dialysis]] as a rescue modality.<ref name=Ajithkumar>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ajithkumar T, Parkinson C, Shamshad F, Murray P |title=Ifosfamide encephalopathy |journal=Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol) |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=108–14 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17355105 |doi=10.1016/j.clon.2006.11.003}}</ref>

Ifosfamide may also cause a [[normal anion gap acidosis]], specifically [[renal tubular acidosis]] type 2.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Washington Manual of Therapeutics|year=2010|publisher=Wolters Kluwer {{!}} Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|pages=407|edition=33|editor=Foster, Corey}}</ref>
