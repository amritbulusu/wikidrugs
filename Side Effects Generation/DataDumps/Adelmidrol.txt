'''Adelmidrol''' is an anti-inflammatory [[ethanolamide]] [[derivative (chemistry)|derivative]] of [[azelaic acid]].

==Description==
Adelmidrol is the semisynthetic diethanolamide derivative of [[azelaic acid]],<ref name="Cerrato">{{cite journal|last1=Cerrato|first1=Santiago|last2=Brazis|first2=Pilar|last3=della Valle|first3=Maria Federica|last4=Miolo|first4=Alda|last5=Puigdemont|first5=Anna|title=Inhibitory effect of topical Adelmidrol on antigen-induced skin wheal and mast cell behavior in a canine model of allergic dermatitis|journal=BMC Veterinary Research|date=2012|volume=8|issue=1|pages=230|doi=10.1186/1746-6148-8-230|accessdate=2017-01-28}}</ref> and has a symmetrical chemical structure. It classed as an  [[ALIAmide]], and is similar to [[palmitoylethanolamide]], the parent molecule in the ALIAmide class of drugs.<ref name="DeFilippis">{{cite journal|last1=De Filippis|first1=Daniele|last2=D’Amico|first2=Alessandra|last3=Cinelli|first3=Maria Pia|last4=Esposito|first4=Giuseppe|last5=Di Marzo|first5=Vincenzo|last6=Iuvone|first6=Teresa|title=Adelmidrol, a palmitoylethanolamide analogue, reduces chronic inflammation in a carrageenin-granuloma model in rats|journal=Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine|date=1 July 2009|volume=13|issue=6|pages=1086–1095|doi=10.1111/j.1582-4934.2008.00353.x|accessdate=2017-01-28}}</ref> ALIAmides are group of fatty acid derivatives with cannabimimetic properties,<ref name="Cerrato" /> which have antiinflammatory and analgesic effects and are thought to act by reducing [[mast cell]] activation.<ref name="DeFilippis" />

It is used extensively in Italy in veterinary medicine, to treat skin inflammation. In 2015 it was found the compound also exerts anti-inflammatory action given systemically in 10&nbsp;mg per kg bodyweight.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Adelmidrol in pet animals and in atopic eczema==

Adelmidrol has been shown to negatively control the behavior of canine skin MCs during pathophysiological conditions (i.e. healing of experimental wounds). In particular, a statistically significant increase of intracytoplasmatic granular content of dermal MCs was shown in adelmidrol (2%)-treated wounds compared to control, thus suggesting the compound is effectively able to down-modulate skin MC degranulation in dogs.<ref>Abramo F, Salluzzi D, Leotta R, Auxilia S, Noli C, Miolo A, Mantis P, Lloyd DH: Mast Cell Morphometry and Densitometry in Experimental Skin Wounds Treated With a Gel Containing Adelmidrol: A Placebo Controlled Study. Wounds 2008, 20:149-157.</ref>

Chronic gingiva inflammation can be a difficult to treat medical problem in dogs. A similar anti-inflammatory effect was observed in these dogs, treated with a gel to reduce gingival inflammation. Twenty dogs were randomised to the adelmidrol gel and placebo. After 30 and 45 days, the dogs using the adelmidrol gel had significantly less inflammation of the gingiva.<ref name="Bonello">{{cite journal|last1=Bonello|first1=D.|last2=Squarzoni|first2=P.|title=Effect of a Mucoadhesive Gel and Dental Scaling on Gingivitis in Dogs|journal=Journal of Veterinary Dentistry|date=March 2008|volume=25|issue=1|pages=28–32|doi=10.1177/089875640802500108|accessdate=2017-01-27}}</ref>

Furthermore, the local application of adelmidrol has been recently confirmed to reduce MC responses during chronic experimental inflammation, as shown by the significant decrease of mediators selectively expressed by MCs and involved in skin inflammation, such as chymase.<ref name="DeFilippis" />

Adelmidrol seems suitable for topical application, as it exhibits both hydrophilic and lipophilic features, which help it to be absorbed into the skin, as the epidermis is composed of alternating lipophilic and hydrophilic layers.<ref name="Cerrato" />

A 4-week topical treatment with adelmidrol 2% emulsion in children affected by mild atopic dermatitis resulted in complete resolution in 80% of cases, with no side effects and no relapses at 8-week follow up.<ref>Pulvirenti N, Nasca MR, Micali G: Topical adelmidrol 2% emulsion, a novel aliamide, in the treatment of mild atopic dermatitis in pediatric subjects: a pilot study.
