'''Orlistat''' is a drug designed to treat [[obesity]]. It is marketed as a [[prescription drug]] under the trade name '''Xenical''' by [[Hoffmann–La Roche|Roche]] in most countries, and is sold [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] as '''Alli'''<ref>Stylized with a lowercase ''a'' on the packaging, and a [[Macron (diacritic)|bar]] over the ''i'' (that is, "allī"), but capitalized conventionally in the manual.</ref> by [[GlaxoSmithKline]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]].<ref name="TotalSynth">{{cite journal |vauthors=Bodkin J, Humphries E, McLeod M | title = The total synthesis of (−)-tetrahydrolipstatin | journal = [[Australian Journal of Chemistry]] | volume = 56 | issue = 8 | pages = 795–803 | year = 2003 | doi = 10.1071/CH03121}}</ref> Its primary function is preventing the absorption of fats from the human diet by acting as a [[Lipase inhibitors|lipase inhibitor]], thereby reducing [[calorie|caloric]] intake.

The effectiveness of orlistat in promoting [[weight loss]] is definite but modest. Pooled data from [[clinical trial]]s suggest that people given orlistat in addition to lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise, lose about {{convert|2|-|3|kg|lb}} more than those not taking the drug over the course of a year.<ref name=Padwal>{{cite journal|vauthors =Padwal R, Li SK, Lau DC |title=Long-term pharmacotherapy for obesity and overweight |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=3 |pages=CD004094 |year=2004 |pmid=15266516 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004094.pub2 |editor1-last=Padwal |editor1-first=Raj S}}</ref> Orlistat also modestly reduces [[blood pressure]] and appears to prevent the onset of [[type 2 diabetes]], whether from the weight loss itself or to other effects. In a large [[randomized controlled trial]], orlistat was found to reduce the incidence of diabetes by nearly 40% in obese people.<ref name=XENDOS />

Benefits aside, however, orlistat is notorious for its gastrointestinal [[adverse drug reaction|side effects]] (sometimes referred to as ''treatment effects''), which can include [[steatorrhea]] (oily, loose stools). They decrease with time, however, and are the most frequently reported adverse effects of the drug.<ref>{{cite web|title=Orlistat Side Effects|url=http://weight-loss.emedtv.com/orlistat/orlistat-side-effects.html}}</ref> In Australia, the United States and the European Union, orlistat is available for sale [[over-the-counter drug|without a prescription]].<ref>{{cite web|title=POISONS STANDARD JUNE 2017|date=June 2017|accessdate=18 August 2017|website=Federal Register of Legislation|publisher=Therapeutic Goods Administration|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2017L00605}}</ref> Over-the-counter approval was controversial in the United States, with [[consumer organization|consumer advocacy]] group [[Public Citizen]] repeatedly opposing it on safety and efficacy grounds.<ref name="WP2" /> [[Generic drug|Generic]] formulations of orlistat are available in some countries.

== Medical uses ==
Orlistat is used for the treatment of [[obesity]]. The amount of weight loss achieved with orlistat varies. In one-year [[clinical trial]]s, between 35.5% and 54.8% of subjects achieved a 5% or greater decrease in body mass, although not all of this mass was necessarily fat. Between 16.4% and 24.8% achieved at least a 10% decrease in body fat.<ref name="RxList" /> After orlistat was stopped, a [[statistical significance|significant]] number of subjects regained weight—up to 35% of the weight they had lost.<ref name="RxList" />

The incidence of [[diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]] in an obese population over four years is decreased with orlistat (6.2%) compared to placebo (9.0%).<ref name="XENDOS">{{cite journal |vauthors=Torgerson J, Hauptman J, Boldrin M, Sjöström L | title = XENical in the prevention of diabetes in obese subjects (XENDOS) study: a randomized study of orlistat as an adjunct to lifestyle changes for the prevention of type 2 diabetes in obese patients | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 155–61 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14693982 | url = http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/27/1/155 | doi = 10.2337/diacare.27.1.155}}</ref> Long-term use of orlistat also leads to a very modest reduction in [[blood pressure]] (mean reductions of 2.5 and 1.9 [[mmHg]] in [[Systole (medicine)|systolic]] and [[diastole|diastolic]] blood pressure respectively).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Siebenhofer|first1=A|last2=Jeitler|first2=K|last3=Horvath|first3=K|last4=Berghold|first4=A|last5=Siering|first5=U|last6=Semlitsch|first6=T|title=Long-term effects of weight-reducing drugs in hypertensive patients|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=28 March 2013|issue=3|pages=CD007654|pmid=23543553|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007654.pub3}}</ref>

== Contraindications ==
Orlistat is [[Contraindication|contraindicated]] in:<ref name="XenicalLabel" />
* [[Malabsorption]]
* Hypersensitivity to orlistat
* Reduced [[gallbladder]] function (e.g. after [[cholecystectomy]])
* [[Pregnancy]] and [[breastfeeding]]
* Use caution with: obstructed [[bile duct]], impaired liver function, and [[pancreatic disease]]
<!-- * Certain [[kidney]] problems -->

== Side effects ==
The primary [[adverse drug reaction|side effects]] of the drug are gastrointestinal-related, and include [[steatorrhea]] (oily, loose stools with excessive [[flatus]] due to unabsorbed fats reaching the large intestine), [[fecal incontinence]] and frequent or urgent bowel movements.<ref>{{cite web|title=Treating Obesity|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Obesity/Pages/Treatment.aspx|publisher=NHS|accessdate=13 July 2013}}</ref> GlaxoSmithKline recommends that all users be cautious of the possible side effects until they "have a sense of any treatment effects".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.myalli.com/howdoesitwork/treatmenteffects.aspx |title=myalli.com&nbsp;– what are treatment effects? |accessdate=24 June 2007 |work= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070625134801/http://www.myalli.com/howdoesitwork/treatmenteffects.aspx <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 25 June 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-me-diet15jun15,0,3267551.story?coll=la-home-center |title=New diet drug touches off a feeding frenzy |last=Hall |first=Carla |date=15 June 2007 |accessdate=20 June 2007 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070618234036/http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-me-diet15jun15%2C0%2C3267551.story?coll=la-home-center |archivedate=18 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> To minimize these effects, foods with high fat content should be avoided; the manufacturer advises consumers to follow a low-fat, reduced-calorie diet.

On 26 May 2010, the [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved a revised label for Xenical to include new safety information about cases of severe liver injury that have been reported rarely with the use of this medication.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm213038.htm|title=FDA Drug Safety Communication: Completed safety review of Xenical/Alli (orlistat) and severe liver injury|work=fda.gov}}</ref>

An analysis of over 900 orlistat users in Ontario showed that their rate of acute kidney injury was more than triple that of non-users.<ref>http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/extract/171/7/703</ref> The putative mechanism for this effect is postulated to be excessive oxalate absorption from the gut and its subsequent deposition in the kidney, with excessive oxalate absorption being a known consequence of fat malabsorption.

An April 2013 study published in the British Medical Journal <ref>{{cite journal |author1=Douglas, Ian J |author2=Julia Langham |author3=Krishnan Bhaskaran |author4=Ruth Brauer |author5=Liam Smeeth |title = Orlistat and the risk of acute liver injury: self controlled case series study in UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink |journal=BMJ |volume=346 |pages=f1936 | year = 2013 |doi = 10.1136/bmj.f1936 |pmid=23585064 |pmc=3624963 |url = http://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.f1936}}</ref> looked at 94,695 patients receiving orlistat in the UK between 1999 and 2011. This study showed no evidence of an increased risk of liver injury during treatment. They concluded:
:''The incidence of acute liver injury was higher in the periods both immediately before and immediately after the start of orlistat treatment. This suggests that the observed increased risks of liver injury linked to the start of treatment may reflect changes in health status associated with the decision to begin treatment rather than any causal effect of the drug.''

=== Long-term ===
Despite a higher incidence of [[breast cancer]] amongst those taking orlistat in early, pooled clinical trial data—the analysis of which delayed FDA review of orlistat<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/20/us/obesity-drug-can-lead-to-modest-weight-loss-study-finds.html?pagewanted=all | title = Obesity Drug Can Lead to Modest Weight Loss, Study Finds | last = Kolata | first = Gina | authorlink = Gina Kolata | date = 20 January 1999 | accessdate = 11 December 2007 | work = [[The New York Times]]}}</ref>—a two-year study published in 1999 found similar rates between orlistat and placebo (0.54% versus 0.51%), and evidence that tumors predated treatment in 3 of the 4 participants who had them.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Davidson MH, Hauptman J, DiGirolamo M, etal |title=Weight control and risk factor reduction in obese subjects treated for 2 years with orlistat: a randomized controlled trial |journal=JAMA |volume=281 |issue=3 |pages=235–42 |year=1999 |pmid=9918478|doi=10.1001/jama.281.3.235}}</ref> There is evidence from an ''[[in vitro]]'' study to suggest that the introduction of specific varied preparations containing orlistat, namely the concurrent administration of orlistat and the [[monoclonal antibody]] [[trastuzumab]], can induce [[programmed cell death|cell death]] in breast cancer cells and block their growth.<ref name="Menendez et al.">{{cite journal |author1=J.

Fecal fat excretion promotes [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] carcinogenesis.  In 2006 the results of 30-day study were published indicating that orlistat at a dosage of 200&nbsp;mg/kg chow administered to rats consuming a high-fat chow and receiving two 25&nbsp;mg/kg doses of the potent carcinogen [[1,2-dimethylhydrazine]] produced significantly higher numbers of [[aberrant crypt foci]] (ACF) colon lesions than did the carcinogen plus high-fat chow without orlistat.<ref name="Garcia et al.">{{cite journal |vauthors=Garcia S, da Costa Barros L, Turatti A, Martinello F, Modiano P, Ribeiro-Silva A, de Oliveira Vespúcio M, Uyemura S | title = The anti-obesity agent Orlistat is associated to increase in colonic preneoplastic markers in rats treated with a chemical carcinogen | journal = Cancer Lett | volume = 240 | issue = 2 | pages = 221–4 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16377080 | doi = 10.1016/j.canlet.2005.09.011}}</ref>  ACF lesions are believed to be one of the earliest precursors of [[colon cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Takayama T, Katsuki S, Takahashi Y, Ohi M, Nojiri S, Sakamaki S, Kato J, Kogawa K, Miyake H, Niitsu Y |title=Aberrant crypt foci of the colon as precursors of adenoma and cancer |journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine|N Engl J Med]] |volume=339 |issue=18 |pages=1277–84 |year=1998 |pmid=9791143 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199810293391803 |url = http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJM199810293391803 | format = PDF }}</ref>

=== Precautions ===
Absorption of [[Fat soluble vitamins|fat-soluble]] [[vitamin]]s and other fat-soluble nutrients is inhibited by the use of orlistat. A multivitamin tablet containing vitamins [[vitamin A|A]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Vitamin A|url=http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/#h6}}</ref>  [[vitamin D|D]], [[vitamin E|E]], [[vitamin K|K]], and [[beta-carotene]] should be taken once a day, at bedtime, when using orlistat.<ref name="XenicalLabel" />

=== Interactions ===
Orlistat may reduce plasma levels of [[ciclosporin]] (also known as "cyclosporin" or "cyclosporine", trade names Sandimmune, Gengraf, Neoral, etc.)<!-- "ciclosporin" is the International Nonproprietary Name, not a typo; please do not alter the spelling without discussing -->, an [[immunosuppressive drug]] frequently used to prevent [[transplant rejection]]; the two drugs should therefore not be administered concomitantly.<ref name="XenicalLabel" /> Orlistat can also impair absorption of the [[antiarrhythmic agent|antiarrhythmic]] [[amiodarone]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhi J, Moore R, Kanitra L, Mulligan TE |title=Effects of orlistat, a lipase inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of three highly lipophilic drugs (amiodarone, fluoxetine, and simvastatin) in healthy volunteers |journal=J Clin Pharmacol |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=428–35 |year=2003 |pmid=12723464 |doi=10.1177/0091270003252236}}</ref> The [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency|MHRA]] has recently suggested that Orlistat could theoretically reduce the absorption of [[antiretroviral]] [[HIV]] medications.<ref>{{cite web

Orlistat works by inhibiting gastric and pancreatic [[lipases]], the [[enzyme]]s that break down [[triglycerides]] in the [[intestine]]. When lipase activity is blocked, triglycerides from the diet are not [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] into absorbable free [[fatty acid]]s, and instead are excreted unchanged. Only trace amounts of orlistat are absorbed systemically; the primary effect is local lipase inhibition within the [[gastrointestinal tract|GI tract]] after an oral dose. The primary route of elimination is through the [[feces]].

Orlistat was also recently found to [[Discovery and development of gastrointestinal lipase inhibitors#Mechanism of action|inhibit the thioesterase domain of fatty acid synthase (FAS)]], an enzyme involved in the proliferation of cancer cells but not normal cells. However, potential side effects of Orlistat, such as inhibition of other cellular off-targets or poor bioavailability, might hamper its application as an effective antitumor agent. One profiling study undertook a chemical proteomics approach to look for new cellular targets of orlistat, including its off-targets {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}. Orlistat also show potential activities mycobacteria and ''Trypanosoma brucei'' parasite (See further reading).

At the standard prescription dose of 120&nbsp;[[milligram|mg]] three times daily before meals, orlistat prevents approximately 30% of dietary fat from being absorbed,<ref name="PDR">{{cite book |title= 2006 Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR) |year= 2006 |publisher= Thomson PDR |isbn= 1-56363-527-5}}</ref> and about 25% at the standard over-the-counter dose of 60&nbsp;mg.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.myalli.com/whatisalli/commonquestions.aspx | title = myalli.com&nbsp;– frequently asked questions | year = 2007 | accessdate = 18 August 2007 | publisher = [[GlaxoSmithKline]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070712125349/http://www.myalli.com/whatisalli/commonquestions.aspx <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 12 July 2007}}</ref><ref>Parker-Pope, Tara.

== Legal status ==
[[File:Xenical.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Packaging of orlistat (Xenical) 120 mg capsules, as sold in Canada]]
Orlistat has historically been available by prescription only, and this situation continues in [[Canada]]. In Australia, the [[European Union]],<ref name=BBC /> and the United States, certain formulations of orlistat have been approved for sale [[over-the-counter drug|without a prescription]].

In 2009, [[Hoffmann–La Roche|Roche]] began recruiting in Russia for a clinical trial of Xenical in obese teenagers between the ages of 12 and 14.<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00940628}}</ref>

=== Australia and New Zealand ===
In Australia and New Zealand, orlistat is {{As of|2009|alt=currently}} available [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] in 120&nbsp;mg size (84 capsules to the pack). Initially available only with a prescription, it was reclassified as a "[[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Drugs and Poisons#Schedule 3 Pharmacist Only Medicine|Pharmacist Only Medicine]]" in October 2003. In 2007 the Committee decided to keep orlistat as a [[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Drugs and Poisons|Schedule 3 drug]], but withdrew its authorization of direct-to-consumer Xenical advertising, stating this "increased pressure on pharmacists to provide orlistat to consumers...this in turn had the potential to result in inappropriate patterns of use".<ref>{{cite press release | url = http://www.tga.gov.au/media/2007/070222-orlistat.htm | title = Scheduling of orlistat | date = 22 February 2007 | accessdate = 3 March 2007 | publisher = [[Australia]]n [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]]}}</ref> Xenical has recently{{when|date=April 2012}} began being advertised direct-to-customers again.

==Society and culture==

===Cost===
At times, such as in spring 2012, orlistat has come into short supply, with consequent price increases because of nonavailability of one of the drug's components.<ref>{{cite news

=== Counterfeit products ===
In January 2010, the [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] issued an alert stating that some counterfeit versions of Alli sold over the Internet contain no orlistat, and instead contain the weight-loss drug [[sibutramine]]. The concentration of sibutramine in these counterfeit products is at least twice the amount recommended for weight loss.<ref>{{cite news |publisher= CNN |url= http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/01/23/fake.diet.drug/index.html |title= Fake Alli diet pills can pose health risks |accessdate= 24 January 2010 | date=23 January 2010}}</ref>
