Arguments against desiccated thyroid include:
#Desiccated thyroid preparations have a greater variability from batch to batch than synthetic ones.<ref name="endocrinetoday.com"/>  
#Desiccated thyroid has roughly a 4:1 ratio of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3).  In humans, the ratio is 11:1.<ref>[http://www.endocrinetoday.com/comments.aspx?rid=35766 Repas, Thomas.  Desiccated thyroid in the management of hypothyroidism: Part I.]</ref> 
#A combination of various ratios of T4 and T3 may not provide benefits over T4 alone.

#The use of desiccated thyroid is usually accompanied with the practice of dosing according to symptoms instead of dosing to achieve "ideal" lab results (e.g. serum levels of TSH).  While there is debate as to what the ideal serum levels are, dosing according to symptoms often results in higher dosages.  Most endocrinologists are opposed to these higher dosages as there may be risks of hyperthyroidism and osteoporosis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.endocrinetoday.com/comments.aspx?rid=35766 |title=Endocrine Today Blog |publisher=Endocrinetoday.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-24}}</ref>

==History==
The earliest oral treatment for hypothyroidism consisted of thyroid extract. [[George Redmayne Murray]] of the [[United Kingdom]] first described treatment of [[myxedema]] with thyroid extract in 1891, and published a description of long-term successful treatment (28 years) of a patient with myxedema (severe hypothyroidism) in 1920<ref>Murray GR. The life history of the first case of myxoedema treated by thyroid extract. ''[[Br Med J]]'' 1920;i:359-60.</ref> His treatment was quickly adopted in North America and Europe. The first recorded American use dates to 1891 by a woman who was still taking it 52 years later at 84 years of age <ref>Burgess AM. Myxedema-- controlled by thyroid extract for fifty-two years: report of a case. [[Ann Internal Med]] 1946; 25:146.</ref>

Desiccated thyroid extract is prepared from pig thyroid glands. The glands are dried (desiccated), ground to powder, combined with binder chemicals, and pressed into pills. This was a new use for parts that were previously unwanted [[slaughterhouse]] [[offal]], and [[Armour and Company]], the dominant American [[meatpacking|meatpacker]] in the 20th century, supplied the best-known brand of thyroid extract. {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Replacement by thyroid extract in hypothyroidism was one of the most effective treatments of any disease available to physicians before the middle of the 20th century, {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} and in severe cases afforded dramatic relief of the myriad symptoms. The decision to treat was usually based on the presence of signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism because there were no accurate, readily available [[medical test|laboratory tests]] of thyroid function. Many less severe cases of hypothyroidism went untreated.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Dosage was regulated by improvement of [[symptom]]s.

Desiccated Thyroid became a commercial treatment option in 1934 with Westhroid,{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}. In the early 1960s, desiccated thyroid hormones (thyroid extract) began to be replaced by  [[levothyroxine]] (T4), or by combinations of T4 and T3. Replacement occurred faster in the United Kingdom than in North America, but by the 1980s more patients were being prescribed levothyroxine or T4/T3 combinations than desiccated thyroid extract.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Several reasons have been identified as to why prescriptions changed from desiccated thyroid treatment. 
*Although thyroid extract was useful and usually effective, some patients continued to complain of fatigue, weight gain, or other symptoms. Dosing until the 1960s was often a matter of prolonged adjustment trials.<ref>Means JH, DeGroot LJ, Stanbury JB. The Thyroid and its Diseases. 3rd ed. New York:McGraw Hill, 1963. See chapter 9 for a lengthy discussion of the difficulties of assessing treatment in the era before effective tests, as well as the doctors' impressions of the superiority of the new synthetic thyroxine that had just become available.</ref>
*It was known that not all of the iodine content of thyroid extract was in the form of effective T4 and T3 and that actual content of available preparations varied more than the permitted 15%.<ref name="pmid13764789">{{cite journal | author = Macgregor AG | title = Why does anybody use thyroid B.P.? | journal = [[The Lancet|Lancet]] | volume = 1 | issue = 7172 | pages = 329–32 |date=February 1961 | pmid = 13764789 | doi = 10.1016/s0140-6736(61)91498-2 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Catz B, Ginsburg E, Salenger S | year = 1962 | title = Clinically inactive thyroid U.S.P.: a preliminary report | url = | journal = [[New Engl J Med]] | volume = 266 | issue = | page = 136 | doi=10.1056/nejm196201182660308}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Pileggi VJ, Golub DJ, Lee ND | year = 1965 | title = Determination of thyroxine and triiodothyronine in commercial preparations of desiccated thyroid and thyroid extract | url = | journal = [[J Clin Endocrinol Metab]] | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 949–56 | doi=10.1210/jcem-25-7-949}}</ref><ref name="pmid5409525">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mangieri CN, Lund MH | title = Potency of United States Pharmacopeia desiccated thyroid tablets as determined by the antigoitrogenic assay in rats | journal = [[J.

*By the 1960s, it was known that thyroxine was the essential hormone produced by the thyroid gland, and that most T3 was manufactured in other parts of the body by deiodination of thyroxine. It was demonstrated in hypothyroid animals and people that replacement of thyroxine alone corrected the measurable manifestations (laboratory test results) of hypothyroidism.<ref>Braverman LE, Ingbar SH, Sterling K.

*It was discovered that a healthy person varied the amount of T3 produced from T4 in response to changing needs and conditions{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} and it seemed wiser not to bypass this control system by providing larger amounts of T3 than were naturally produced each day{{Synthesis inline |date=December 2013}}.
*Furthermore, when T3 could be measured, it was discovered that thyroid extract and synthetic combinations of T4 and T3{{contradict-inline |reason=Natural extract, or synthetic? |date=December 2013}} produced significantly greater fluctuations of T3 throughout the day than occurred in healthy people or hypothyroid people treated with thyroxine alone.<ref>Surks MI, Schadlow AR, Oppenheimer JH.

*[[Endocrinology|Endocrinologists]] found that treatment with thyroxine alone worked as well or better than thyroid extract for the majority of patients, although even thyroxine did not reverse all the symptoms of a minority.<ref name="pmid371874" />

Thyroid care changed in other ways as well. Accurate T4 and T3 measurements became widely used in the 1970s, and by the late 1980s, TSH measurement had become sensitive enough to detect mild degrees of [[hyperthyroidism]] and overtreatment.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} Blood levels of thyroid hormones and TSH were found to be the best predictors of objective benefits from thyroid replacement{{Synthesis inline |date=December 2013}}: those with the most severe measurable deficiency enjoyed the most dramatic and sustained benefits.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} It was also discovered that even mild [[hyperthyroidism]] as defined by a suppressed TSH level, whether due to disease or overtreatment, was associated with poorer [[bone density]] in women, and with higher rates of [[atrial fibrillation]] in elderly patients.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}
