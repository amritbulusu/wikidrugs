'''Lubazodone''' (developmental code names '''YM-992''', '''YM-35995''') is an experimental [[antidepressant]] which was under development by [[Yamanouchi]] for the treatment for [[major depressive disorder]] in the late 1990s and early 2000s but was never marketed.<ref name="pmid17017959">{{cite journal | vauthors = Moltzen EK, Bang-Andersen B | title = Serotonin reuptake inhibitors: the corner stone in treatment of depression for half a century--a medicinal chemistry survey | journal = Curr Top Med Chem | volume = 6 | issue = 17 | pages = 1801–23 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17017959 | doi = | url = }}</ref><ref name="RankovicHargreaves2012">{{cite book|author1=Zoran Rankovic|author2=Richard Hargreaves|author3=Matilda Bingham|title=Drug Discovery for Psychiatric Disorders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e3YoDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA193|date=8 October 2012|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|isbn=978-1-84973-494-3|pages=193–}}</ref><ref name="AdisInsight">http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800008166</ref> It acts as a [[serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (K<sub>i</sub> for {{abbrlink|SERT|serotonin transporter}} = 21&nbsp;nM) and [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] (K<sub>i</sub> = 86&nbsp;nM), and hence has the profile of a [[serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor]] (SARI).<ref name="pmid17017959" /><ref name="RankovicHargreaves2012" /> The drug has good [[binding selectivity|selectivity]] against a range of other [[monoamine receptor]]s, with its next highest [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinities]] being for the [[alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor]] (K<sub>i</sub> = 200&nbsp;nM) and the [[5-HT2C receptor|5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor]] (K<sub>i</sub> = 680&nbsp;nM).<ref name="pmid17017959" /> Lubazodone is structurally related to [[trazodone]] and [[nefazodone]], but is a stronger serotonin reuptake inhibitor and weaker as a 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor antagonist in comparison to them and is more balanced in its actions as a SARI.<ref name="pmid17017959" /><ref name="RankovicHargreaves2012" /> It reached [[Phases of clinical research#Phase II|phase II]] [[clinical trial]]s for depression,<ref name="AdisInsight" /> but development was discontinued in 2001 reportedly due to the "erosion of the {{abbrlink|SSRI|selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor}} market in the United States".<ref name="pmid17017959" />
