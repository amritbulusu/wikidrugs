==Medical uses==
If [[percutaneous coronary intervention]] (PCI) is not available within 90-120 minutes of first contact, streptokinase is recommended [[intravenously]] as soon as possible after the onset of a [[ST elevation myocardial infarction]] (STEMI). As Streptokinase is a [[bacterium|bacteria]]l product, the body has the ability to build up an immunity to it. Therefore, it is recommended that this medication should not be used again after four days from the first administration, as it may not be as effective and can also cause an [[allergic reaction]]. For this reason, it is usually given only for a person's first heart attack.  Further thrombotic events could be treated with [[Tissue plasminogen activator|Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)]]. Overdose of streptokinase or [[tissue plasminogen activator|tPA]] can be treated with [[aminocaproic acid]].

Streptokinase belongs to a group of medications known as [[fibrinolytics]], and complexes of streptokinase with human plasminogen can hydrolytically activate other unbound plasminogen by activating through [[bond cleavage]] to produce [[plasmin]]. There are three domains to streptokinase, denoted α (residues 1–150), β (residues 151–287), and γ (residues 288–414). Each domain binds plasminogen, although none can activate plasminogen independently.<ref name="pmid12704199">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mundada LV, Prorok M, DeFord ME, Figuera M, Castellino FJ, Fay WP | title = Structure-function analysis of the streptokinase amino terminus (residues 1-59) | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 278 | issue = 27 | pages = 24421–7 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12704199 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M301825200 }}</ref>

Plasmin is produced in the [[blood]] to break down [[fibrin]], the major constituent of blood [[thrombus|thrombi]], thereby dissolving clots once they have fulfilled their purpose of stopping bleeding.  Extra production of plasmin caused by streptokinase breaks down unwanted blood clots, for example, in the [[lungs]] (pulmonary embolism). The usual activation of Plasminogen (Plgn) is by [[proteolysis]] of the Arg561—Val562 bond.<ref name="pmid9446629">{{cite journal | vauthors = Young KC, Shi GY, Wu DH, Chang LC, Chang BI, Ou CP, Wu HL | title = Plasminogen activation by streptokinase via a unique mechanism | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 273 | issue = 5 | pages = 3110–6 | date = January 1998 | pmid = 9446629 | doi =  10.1074/jbc.273.5.3110}}</ref> The amino group of Val562 then forms a salt-bridge with Asp740, which triggers a conformational change producing the active protease Plasmin (Pm). When (SK) is present, it binds to Plgn to form a complex (SK. Plgn) that converts substrate Plgn to Pm. Residues 1–59 of SK regulate its capacity to induce an active site in bound Pg by a nonproteolytic mechanism and to activate [[Enzyme substrate|substrate]] Pg in a fibrin-independent manner. This complex subsequently rearranges to an active complex although the Arg561–Val562 bond remains intact. Therefore, another [[Residue (chemistry)|residue]] must substitute for the free amino group of Val562 and provide a counterion for Asp740 in this active complex.<ref name="pmid11724583">{{cite journal | vauthors = Loy JA, Lin X, Schenone M, Castellino FJ, Zhang XC, Tang J | title = Domain interactions between streptokinase and human plasminogen | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 40 | issue = 48 | pages = 14686–95 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11724583 | doi = 10.1021/bi011309d }}</ref> Two candidates for this counterion have been suggested: Ile1 of streptokinase and Lys698 of Plgn. Deletion of Ile1 of SK markedly [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibits]] its capacity to induce an active site in plasminogen, which supports the hypothesis that establishment of a salt bridge between Ile1 of SK and Asp740 of plasminogen is necessary for SK to induce an active site in plasminogen by a nonproteolytic mechanism.<ref name="PMID10213631">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang S, Reed GL, Hedstrom L | title = Deletion of Ile1 changes the mechanism of streptokinase: evidence for the molecular sexuality hypothesis | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 38 | issue = 16 | pages = 5232–40 | date = April 1999 | pmid = 10213631 | doi = 10.1021/bi981915h }}</ref> In contrast with the Ile1 substitutions, the Lys698 mutations also decreased the dissociation constant of the SK complex by 15 to 50 fold.

==History==
After many years of work along with his student Sol Sherry, William Smith Tillett founded it in 1933. Initially used in treatment of fibrinous pleural exudates, hemothorax and tuberculous meningitis. Its role in acute myocardial infarction was serendipitous.<ref name="pmid17948083">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sikri N, Bardia A | title = A history of streptokinase use in acute myocardial infarction | journal = Texas Heart Institute Journal | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 318–27 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17948083 | pmc = 1995058 | doi = }}</ref> It was later named as streptokinase.

==Research==
Streptokinase may find a use in helping to prevent [[adhesion (medicine)|postoperative adhesions]], a common complication of surgery, especially abdominal surgery ([[appendectomy]], [[gall stones]], [[hysterectomy]], etc.)  One study using animal models (rats) found that when used with a PHBV membrane drug-delivery system, it was 90 percent effective in preventing adhesions.<ref name="pmid12566787">{{cite journal | vauthors = Yagmurlu A, Barlas M, Gursel I, Gokcora IH | title = Reduction of surgery-induced peritoneal adhesions by continuous release of streptokinase from a drug delivery system | journal = European Surgical Research.

==Marketing==
It is marketed in Chile as Streptase by Alpes Selection, under license of [[CSL Behring]] Germany.

Available in Viet Nam under the name Mutose.
Available in Cuba, Venezuela, Ecuador and other Latin American countries under the trademark Heberkinasa, commercialized by Heber Biotech, [[Havana]], [[Cuba]].
Available in India under the name STPase by [[Cadila Pharmaceuticals]], and Myokinase by [[Biocon|Biocon Limited]].
