'''Febuxostat''', sold under the brand names '''Uloric''' in the US and '''Adenuric''' in Europe, is a medication used in the treatment of chronic [[gout]] and [[hyperuricemia]]. It inhibits [[xanthine oxidase]], thus reducing production of [[uric acid]] in the body.

Febuxostat was discovered by scientists at the Japanese pharmaceutical company [[Teijin]] in 1998. Teijin partnered the drug with [[TAP Pharmaceuticals]] in the US and [[Ipsen]] in Europe. Ipsen obtained marketing approval for febuxostat from the [[European Medicines Agency]] in April 2008, [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company|Takeda]] obtained FDA approval in February 2009, and Teijin obtained approval from the Japanese [[Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency]] in 2011.

==Medical uses ==
Febuxostat is used to treat chronic [[gout]] and [[hyperuricemia]].<ref name=NICE/>   [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] concluded that febuxostat is more effective than standard doses of [[allopurinol]], but not more effective than higher doses of allopurinol.<ref name=NICE>[http://guidance.nice.org.uk/TA164/Guidance/Considerations_1 Febuxostat for the management of hyperuricaemia in people with gout (TA164) Chapter 4. Consideration of the evidence] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006212851/http://guidance.nice.org.uk/TA164/Guidance/Considerations_1 |date=October 6, 2010 }}</ref>

Febuxostat is in the US [[pregnancy category]] C; there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.<ref name=label/>

==Side effects==
The adverse effects associated with febuxostat therapy include nausea, diarrhea, arthralgia, headache, increased hepatic serum enzyme levels and rash.<ref name=label>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/021856lbl.pdf Uloric label]  Updated February, 2009.</ref><ref name=Love>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1592/phco.30.6.594 |vauthors=Love BL, Barrons R, Veverka A, Snider KM | title = Urate-lowering therapy for gout: focus on febuxostat | journal = Pharmacotherapy | volume = 30 | issue = 6 | pages = 594–608 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20500048}}</ref>

==Drug interactions==
Febuxostat is contraindicated with concomitant use of [[theophylline]] and [[chemotherapeutic agents]], namely [[azathioprine]] and [[6-mercaptopurine]], because it could increase blood plasma concentrations of these drugs, and therefore their toxicity.<ref name=label/><ref>{{cite book|author1=Ashraf Mozayani |author2=Lionel Raymon |title=Handbook of Drug Interactions: A Clinical and Forensic Guide |year=2011|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]}}</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==
Febuxostat is a non-purine-selective inhibitor of [[xanthine oxidase]].<ref name=label/> It works by [[Non-competitive inhibition|non-competitively]] blocking the [[molybdenum pterin]] center which is the active site on xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase is needed to successively oxidize both [[hypoxanthine]] and [[xanthine]] to uric acid. Hence, febuxostat inhibits xanthine oxidase, therefore reducing production of uric acid. Febuxostat inhibits both oxidized as well as reduced form of xanthine oxidase because of which febuxostat cannot be easily displaced from the molybdenum pterin site.<ref name=Love/>

==Society and culture==

===Cost===
In the UK, NICE has found that febuxostat has a higher cost/benefit ratio than allopurinol and on that basis recommended febuxostat as a second-line drug for people who cannot use allopurinol.<ref name=NICE/>

===Trade names===
Febuxostat is marketed as Adenuric in Europe and New Zealand, Uloric in the US, Goturic and Goutex in Latin America, Feburic in Japan, and is generic in several countries and is available by many names in those countries.<ref name=drugnames>Drugs.com [http://www.drugs.com/international/febuxostat.html Drugs.com international names for febuxostat] Page accessed June 25, 2015</ref>
