[[Human serum albumin|Albumin]]-bound paclitaxel (trade name [[Abraxane]], also called nab-paclitaxel) is an alternative formulation where paclitaxel is bound to albumin nano-particles. Much of the clinical toxicity of paclitaxel is associated with the solvent [[Cremophor EL]] in which it is dissolved for delivery.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0959-8049(01)00171-X | volume=37 | title=Cremophor EL | journal=European Journal of Cancer | pages=1590–1598}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
[[File:Tubulin&paclitaxel-2HXF.png|thumb|left|Complex of α, β tubulin subunits and paclitaxel. Paclitaxel is shown as yellow stick.]]
Paclitaxel is one of several [[cytoskeletal drugs]] that target [[tubulin]]. Paclitaxel-treated cells have defects in mitotic spindle assembly, [[chromosome segregation]], and [[cell division]]. Unlike other tubulin-targeting drugs such as [[colchicine]] that inhibit [[microtubule]] assembly, paclitaxel stabilizes the microtubule polymer and protects it from disassembly. Chromosomes are thus unable to achieve a metaphase spindle configuration.  This blocks the progression of [[mitosis]] and prolonged activation of the mitotic checkpoint triggers [[apoptosis]] or reversion to the G-phase of the cell cycle without cell division.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/sj.onc.1207374 |title=The spindle checkpoint, aneuploidy, and cancer |year=2004 |last1=Bharadwaj |first1=Rajnish |last2=Yu |first2=Hongtao |journal=Oncogene |volume=23 |issue=11 |pages=2016–27 |pmid=15021889}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1083/jcb.200805072 |title=Microtubules do not promote mitotic slippage ''when the'' spindle assembly checkpoint cannot be satisfied |year=2008 |last1=Brito |first1=D.

The ability of paclitaxel to inhibit spindle function is generally attributed to its suppression of microtubule dynamics,<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=15057285 |year=2004 |last1=Jordan |first1=MA |last2=Wilson |first2=L |title=Microtubules as a target for anticancer drugs |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=253–65 |doi=10.1038/nrc1317 |journal=Nature Reviews. Cancer}}</ref> but recent studies have demonstrated that suppression of dynamics occurs at concentrations lower than those needed to block mitosis. At the higher therapeutic concentrations, paclitaxel appears to suppress microtubule detachment from [[centrosome]]s, a process normally activated during mitosis.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=20978163 |year=2010 |last1=Ganguly |first1=A |last2=Yang |first2=H |last3=Cabral |first3=F |title=Paclitaxel-dependent cell lines reveal a novel drug activity |volume=9 |issue=11 |pages=2914–23 |doi=10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-0552 |pmc=2978777 |journal=Molecular cancer therapeutics}}</ref> Paclitaxel binds to beta-tubulin subunits of microtubules.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/jmbi.2001.5077 |title=Refined structure of $alpha;$beta;-tubulin at 3.5 p resolution1 |year=2001 |last1=Lowe |first1=J |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |volume=313 |issue=5 |pages=1045–57 |pmid=11700061 |last2=Li |first2=H |last3=Downing |first3=KH |last4=Nogales |first4=E}}</ref>

==Production==
[[Image:PacificYew 8566.jpg|thumb|Undisturbed Pacific yew bark contains paclitaxel and related chemicals.]]
[[Image:Yew bark Taxol PD.jpg|thumbnail|The bark is peeled and processed to provide paclitaxel.]]

From 1967 to 1993, almost all paclitaxel produced was derived from bark from the Pacific yew, the harvesting of which kills the tree in the process.<ref name="Gersmann 2011">{{cite news|last1=Gersmann|first1=Hanna|last2=Aldred|first2=Jessica|title=Medicinal tree used in chemotherapy drug faces extinction|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/10/iucn-red-list-tree-chemotherapy|accessdate=2017-02-15|work=The Guardian|date=10 November 2011}}</ref> The processes used were descendants of the original isolation method of [[Monroe Eliot Wall|Monroe Wall]] and [[Mansukh C. Wani|Mansukh Wani]]; by 1987, the NCI had contracted Hauser Chemical Research of Boulder, Colorado, to handle bark on the scale needed for Phase II and III trials.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} While both the size of the wild population of ''Taxus brevifola'' and the magnitude of the eventual demand for taxol were uncertain, it was clear for many years{{vague|date=June 2014}} that an alternative, sustainable source of supply of the [[natural product]] would be needed. Initial attempts to broaden its sourcing used needles from the tree, or material from other related ''Taxus'' species, including cultivated ones,{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} but these attempts were challenged by the relatively low and often highly variable yields obtained. Early in the 1990s, coincident with increased sensitivity to the ecology of the forests of the [[Pacific Northwest]], paclitaxel was successfully extracted on a clinically useful scale from these sources.{{sfn|Goodman|Walsh|2001|pp=172–5}}

Concurrently, synthetic chemists in the US and France had been interested in taxol, beginning in the late 1970s.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} As noted, by 1992 extensive efforts were underway to accomplish the total synthesis of paclitaxel, efforts motivated by the desire to generate new chemical understanding rather than to achieve practical commercial production. In contrast, the French group of [[Pierre Potier]] at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique ([[CNRS]]) addressed the matter of overall process yield, showing that it was feasible to isolate relatively large quantities of the compound [[10-deacetylbaccatin]] from the European yew, ''[[Taxus baccata]]'', which grew on the CNRS campus and whose needles were available in large quantity.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}  By virtue of its structure, 10-deacetylbaccatin was seen as a viable starting material for a short [[semisynthesis]] to produce taxol. By 1988 Poitier and collaborators had published a semisynthetic route from needles of ''T. baccata'' to taxol.{{sfn|Goodman|Walsh|2001|pp=100–1}}

The view of the NCI, however, was even this route was not practical.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} The group of [[Robert A. Holton]] had also pursued a practical semisynthetic production route; by late 1989, Holton's group had developed a semisynthetic route to paclitaxel with twice the yield of the Potier process.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} [[Florida State University]], where Holton worked, signed a deal with [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] to license their semisynthesis and future patents.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} In 1992, Holton patented an improved process with an 80% yield, and BMS took the process in-house and started to manufacture paclitaxel in Ireland from 10-deacetylbaccatin isolated from the needles of the European yew.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} In early 1993, BMS announced that it would cease reliance on Pacific yew bark by the end of 1995, effectively terminating ecological controversy over its use.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} This announcement also made good their commitment to develop an alternative supply route, made to the NCI in their CRADA application of 1989.

===Synthesis===
{{Main|Paclitaxel total synthesis}}

[[Image:Taxol number.svg|thumb|Paclitaxel, with rings labeled and accepted numbering scheme shown.]]
By 1992, at least thirty academic research teams globally were working to achieve a [[total synthesis]] of this [[natural product]], with the [[Paclitaxel total synthesis|synthesis]] proceeding from simple [[natural product]]s and other readily available starting materials.<ref name=Hall2003>Nina Hall, 2003, Creating complexity: The beauty and logic of synthesis, Chem. Commun., 661 – 664, {{DOI|10.1039/b212248k}}</ref> This [[total synthesis]] effort was motivated primarily by the desire to generate new chemical understanding, rather than with an expectation of the practical commercial production of paclitaxel. The first laboratories to complete the total synthesis from much less complex starting materials were the research groups of [[Robert A. Holton]], who had the [[Holton taxol total synthesis|first article to be accepted for publication]], and of [[K. C. Nicolaou]] who had the [[Nicolaou Taxol total synthesis|first article to appear in print]] (by a week, on 7 February 1994). Though the Holton submission preceded the Nicolaou by a month (21 December 1993 versus 24 January 1994),<ref>See N. Hall, ibid. See also the [[American Chemical Society]] publication [[Chemical and Engineering News]] (C&EN), Feb. 21, 1994, page 32, and primary citations appearing at Holton and Nicolaou taxol total synthesis articles.</ref> the near coincidence of the publications arising from each of these massive, multiyear efforts—11–18 authors appearing on each of the February 1994 publications—has led the ending of the race to be termed a "tie"<ref name=Flam1994>{{cite journal | last = Flam| first = Faye | authorlink = Faye Flam | year = 1994 | title = Race to synthesize Taxol ends in a tie | url = | journal = Science | volume = 263 | issue = 5149| page = 911 | doi = 10.1126/science.7906053 | pmid = 7906053 }}</ref> or a "photo finish",<ref name=Hall2003/> though each group has argued that their synthetic strategy and tactics were superior.<ref name=Flam1994/>

As of 2006, five additional research groups had reported successful total syntheses of paclitaxel: [[Wender Taxol total synthesis|Wender et al.]] in 1997, and [[Kuwajima Taxol total synthesis|Kuwajima et al.]] and [[Mukaiyama Taxol total synthesis|Mukaiyama et al.]] in 1998 with further [[linear synthesis|linear syntheses]], and [[Danishefsky Taxol total synthesis|Danishefsky et al.]] in 1996 and  [[Takahashi Taxol total synthesis|Takahashi et al.]] in 2006 with further [[convergent synthesis|convergent syntheses]].{{update inline|date=March 2017}} As of that date, all strategies had aimed to prepare a [[10-Deacetylbaccatin]]-type core containing the ABCD ring system, followed generally by last stage addition of the "tail" to the 13-hydroxyl group.<ref name=Hall2003/>

While the "political climate surrounding taxol and ''Taxus brevifolia'' in the early 1990s… helped bolster [a] link between total synthesis and the [taxol] supply problem", and though total synthesis activities were a requisite to explore the [[structure-activity relationship]]s of taxol via generation of analogs for testing, the total synthesis efforts were never seen "as a serious commercial route" to provide significant quantities of the natural product for medical testing or therapeutic use.{{sfn|Goodman|Walsh|2001|pp=179–182}}

==History==
The discovery of paclitaxel began in 1962 as a result of a U.S. [[National Cancer Institute]]-funded screening program.<ref name=NCI2016/> A number of years later it was isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew, ''[[Taxus brevifolia]]'', hence its name "taxol".<ref name=NCI2016/>

The discovery was made by [[Monroe E. Wall]] and [[Mansukh C. Wani]] at the [[Research Triangle Institute]], Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, in 1971.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=ME|first1=WALL|last2=MC|first2=Wani|title=amptothecin and taxol: discovery to clinic—thirteenth Bruce F. Cain Memorial Award Lecture.|journal=Cancer Res.|date=February 15, 1995|volume=55|issue=4|pages=753–60|pmid=7850785|url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/55/4/753.long}}</ref> These scientists isolated the [[natural product]] from the bark of the Pacific yew tree, ''[[Taxus brevifolia]]'', determined its structure and named it "taxol", and arranged for its first biological testing.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} The compound was then developed commercially by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), who had the generic name assigned as "paclitaxel".{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Plant screening program===
In 1955, the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI) in the United States set up the Cancer Chemotherapy National Service Center (CCNSC) to act as a public screening center for anticancer activity in compounds submitted by external institutions and companies.{{sfn|Goodman|Walsh|2001|p=17}} Although the majority of compounds screened were of synthetic origin, one chemist, Jonathan Hartwell, who was employed there from 1958 onwards, had  experience with [[natural product]] derived compounds, and began a plant screening operation.{{sfn|Goodman|Walsh|2001|p=22}} After some years of informal arrangements, in July 1960, the NCI commissioned [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] botanists to collect samples from about 1,000 plant species per year.{{sfn|Goodman|Walsh|2001|pp=25,28}} On 21 August 1962, one of those botanists, Arthur S. Barclay,  collected bark from a single Pacific yew tree, ''[[Taxus brevifolia]]'', in a forest north of the town of [[Packwood, Washington]] as part of a four-month trip to collect material from over 200 different species. The material was then processed by a number of specialist CCNSC subcontractors, and one of the ''Taxus'' samples was found to be cytotoxic in a cellular assay on 22 May 1964.{{sfn|Goodman|Walsh|2001|p=51}}

Accordingly, in late 1964 or early 1965, the fractionation and isolation laboratory run by [[Monroe E. Wall]] in [[Research Triangle Park]], [[North Carolina]], began work on fresh ''Taxus'' samples,  isolating the active ingredient in September 1966 and announcing their findings at an April 1967 [[American Chemical Society]] meeting in [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]].<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=7850785 |year=1995 |last1=Wall |first1=ME |last2=Wani |first2=MC |title=Camptothecin and taxol: Discovery to clinic—thirteenth Bruce F. Cain Memorial Award Lecture |volume=55 |issue=4 |pages=753–60 |journal=Cancer Research}}</ref> They named the pure compound taxol in June 1967.{{sfn|Goodman|Walsh|2001|p=51}}
Wall and his colleague Wani published their results, including the chemical structure, in 1971.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Wani M, Taylor H, Wall M, Coggon P, McPhail A | title = Plant antitumor agents. VI. The isolation and structure of taxol, a novel antileukemic and antitumor agent from ''Taxus brevifolia'' | journal = J Am Chem Soc | volume = 93 | issue = 9 | pages = 2325–7 | year = 1971 | pmid = 5553076 | doi = 10.1021/ja00738a045}}</ref>

The NCI continued to commission work to collect more ''Taxus'' bark and to isolate increasing quantities of taxol. By 1969, 28&nbsp;kg of crude extract had been isolated from almost 1,200&nbsp;kg of bark, although this ultimately yielded only 10 g of pure material,{{sfn|Goodman|Walsh|2001|p=81}} but for several years, no use was made of the compound by the NCI. In 1975, it was shown to be active in another ''[[in vitro]]'' system; two years later, a new department head reviewed the data and finally recommended taxol be moved on to the next stage in the discovery process.{{sfn|Goodman|Walsh|2001|pp=79,81}} This required increasing quantities of purified taxol, up to 600 g, and in 1977 a further request for 7,000&nbsp;lbs of bark was made.

In 1978, two NCI researchers published a report showing taxol was mildly effective in leukaemic mice.<ref>
{{cite journal |author1=Fuchs, David A  |author2=Johnson, Randall K | title = Cytologic evidence that taxol, an antineoplastic agent from ''Taxus brevifolia'', acts as a mitotic spindle poison | journal = Cancer Treatment Reports | volume = 62  | pages = 1219–22 | year = 1978 | pmid = 688258 | issue = 8  }}</ref>
In November 1978, taxol was shown to be effective in [[xenograft]] studies.{{sfn|Goodman|Walsh|2001|p=95}}
Meanwhile, taxol began to be well known in the cell biology, as well as the cancer community, with a publication in early 1979 by [[Susan Band Horwitz|Susan B. Horwitz]], a molecular pharmacologist at [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]],  showing taxol had a previously unknown mechanism of action involving the stabilization of [[microtubules]]. Together with formulation problems, this increased interest from researchers meant that, by 1980, the NCI envisaged needing to collect 20,000&nbsp;lbs of bark.<ref name="Goodman and Walsh p97">{{harvnb|Goodman|Walsh|2001|p=97}}</ref>
Animal toxicology studies were complete by June 1982, and in November NCI applied for the [[Investigational New Drug|IND]] necessary to begin clinical trials in humans.<ref name="Goodman and Walsh p97"/>

===Early clinical trials, supply and the transfer to BMS===
[[phases of clinical research|Phase I]] clinical trials began in April 1984, and the decision to start [[phases of clinical research|Phase II]] trials was made a year later.{{sfn|Goodman|Walsh|2001|p=115}} These larger trials needed more bark and collection of a further 12,000 pounds was commissioned, which enabled some phase II trials to begin by the end of 1986. But by then it was recognized that the demand for taxol might be substantial and that more than 60,000 pounds of bark might be needed as a minimum. This unprecedentedly large amount brought ecological concerns about the impact on yew populations into focus for the first time, as local politicians and foresters expressed unease at the program.<ref name="Goodman and Walsh p120"/>

The first public report from a phase II trial in May 1988 showed an effect in melanoma patients and a remarkable response rate of 30% in patients with refractory ovarian cancer.<ref>
{{cite journal | author = Rowinsky, EK | title = Phase II study of taxol in advanced epithelial malignancies | journal =  Proceedings of the Association of Clinical Oncology | volume = 7  | pages = 136 | year = 1988  |display-authors=etal}}</ref> At this point, Gordon Cragg of the NCI's Natural Product Branch calculated the synthesis of enough taxol to treat all the ovarian cancer and melanoma cases in the US would require the destruction of 360,000 trees annually. For the first time, serious consideration was given to the problem of supply.<ref name="Goodman and Walsh p120"/>
Because of the practical and, in particular, the financial scale of the program needed, the NCI decided to seek association with a pharmaceutical company, and in August 1989, it published a [[Cooperative Research and Development Agreement]] (CRADA) offering its current stock and supply from current bark stocks, and proprietary access to the data so far collected, to a company willing to commit to providing the funds to collect further raw material, isolate taxol, and fund a large proportion of clinical trials. In the words of Goodman and Welsh, authors of a substantial scholarly book on taxol, "The NCI was thinking, not of collaboration, ... but of a hand-over of taxol (and its problems)".<ref name="Goodman and Walsh p120">{{harvnb|Goodman|Walsh|2001|p=120}}</ref>

Although the offer was widely advertised, only four companies responded to the CRADA, including the American firm [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] (BMS),
which was selected as the partner in December 1989. The choice of BMS later became controversial and was the subject of Congressional hearings in 1991 and 1992. While it seems clear the NCI had little choice but to seek a commercial partner, there was also controversy about the terms of the deal, eventually leading to a report by the [[General Accounting Office]] in 2003, which concluded the NIH had failed to ensure value for money.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wyden.senate.gov/leg_issues/reports/taxol.pdf|format=PDF|title=Technology Transfer: NIH-Private Sector Partnership in the Development of Taxol}}</ref> In related CRADAs with the [[USDA]] and [[Department of the Interior]],  Bristol-Myers Squibb was given exclusive first refusal on all Federal supplies of ''Taxus brevifolia''.
This exclusive contract lead to some criticism for giving BMS a "cancer [[monopoly]]".<ref name="monopoly">Nader, Ralph; Love, James. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20040924184528/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1295/is_n2_v57/ai_13417481 Looting the medicine chest: how Bristol-Myers Squibb made off with the public's cancer research]." ''[[The Progressive]].'' February 1993. Retrieved on March 9, 2007.</ref>
Eighteen months after the CRADA, BMS  filed a [[new drug application]] (NDA), which was given FDA approval at the very end of 1992.
<ref name="Goodman and Walsh p120"/>
Although there was no patent on the compound, the provisions of the Waxman-Hatch Act gave Bristol-Myers Squibb five years exclusive marketing rights.

In 1990, BMS applied to trademark the name taxol as ''Taxol(R)''. This was controversially approved in 1992. At the same time, paclitaxel replaced taxol as the generic ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) name of the compound.  Critics, including the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', argued the name taxol had been used for more than two decades and in more than 600 scientific articles and suggested the trademark should not have been awarded and the BMS should renounce its rights to it.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/373370a0 |title=Names for hi-jacking |year=1995 |journal=Nature |volume=373 |issue=6513 |pages=370 |pmid=7830775}}</ref> BMS argued changing the name would cause confusion among oncologists and possibly endanger the health of patients. BMS has continued to defend its rights to the name in the courts.{{sfn|Goodman|Walsh|2001|p=170}}
BMS has also been criticized for misrepresentation by Goodman and Walsh, who quote from a company report saying "It was not until 1971 that ... testing ... enabled the isolation of paclitaxel, initially described as 'compound 17".<ref>Bristol-Myers Squibb, The development of TAXOL (paclitaxel), March 1997, as cited in {{harvnb|Goodman|Walsh|2001|p=2}}</ref> This quote is, strictly speaking, accurate: the objection seems to be that this misleadingly neglects to explain that it was the scientist doing the isolation who named the compound taxol and it was not referred to in any other way for more than twenty years.

Annual sales peaked in 2000, reaching [[US$]]1.6 billion; paclitaxel is now available in generic form. In October 2007 it was approved by Drug controller General of India for the treatment of breast cancer and launched by collaboration with Biocon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biocon.com/docs%5CPress_Release_Q2_%2008_09.pdf|title=Press release Biocon|last=India get Breast Treatment|date=|website=|publisher=Biocon|access-date=}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Aside from its direct clinical use, paclitaxel is used extensively in biological and biomedical research as a [[microtubule]] stabilizer.  In general, [[in vitro]] assays involving microtubules, such as motility assays, rely on paclitaxel to maintain microtubule integrity in the absence of the various nucleating factors and other stabilizing elements found in the cell.  For example, it is used for in vitro tests of drugs that aim to alter the behavior of microtubule [[motor proteins]], or for studies of mutant motor proteins.  Moreover, Paclitaxel has been used in vitro to inhibit insulin fibrillation; in a molar ratio of 10:1 (insulin:paclitaxel), it hindered insulin fibrillation near 70%. Iso-thermal titration calorimetry (ITC) findings indicated a spontaneous tendency of paclitaxel to interact with insulin through hydrogen bonds and van der Waal’s forces.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=24535601 |year=2014 |last1=Kachooei |first1=E |last2=Moosavi-Movahedi |first2=AA |last3=Khodagholi |first3=F |last4=Mozaffarian |first4=F |last5=Sadeghi |first5=P |last6=Hadi-Alijanvand |first6=H |last7=Ghasemi |first7=A |last8=Saboury |first8=AA |last9=Farhadi |first9=M |last10=Sheibani |first10=N |title=Inhibition study on insulin fibrillation and cytotoxicity by paclitaxel |volume=155 |issue=6 |pages=361–373 |journal=The Journal of Biochemistry |doi=10.1093/jb/mvu012}}</ref> Paclitaxel is sometimes used for [[in vivo]] studies as well; it can be fed to test organisms, such as [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]], or injected into individual cells, to inhibit microtubule disassembly or to increase the number of microtubules in the cell.
