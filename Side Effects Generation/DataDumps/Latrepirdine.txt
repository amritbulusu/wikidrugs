'''Latrepirdine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], also known as '''dimebolin''' and sold as '''Dimebon'''), is an [[antihistamine]] [[drug]] which has been used clinically in [[Russia]] since 1983.<ref name="pmid6225678">{{cite journal | author = Matveeva IA | title = Action of dimebon on histamine receptors | journal = Farmakologiia i Toksikologiia |date=July–August 1983 | volume = 46 | issue = 4 | pages = 27–29 | language = Russian | pmid = 6225678}}</ref>

Research was conducted in both Russia and western nations into potential applications as a neuroprotective drug to treat [[Alzheimer's disease]] and, possibly, as a [[nootropic]], as well.<ref name="pmid16250325">{{cite journal |vauthors=Shevtsova EF, Kireeva EG, Bachurin SO | title = Mitochondria as the target for neuroprotectors | journal = Vestnik Rossiiskoi Akademii Meditsinskikh Nauk | year = 2005 | issue = 9 | pages = 13–17 | language = Russian | pmid = 16250325}}</ref>  After a  major phase III clinical trial for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment failed to show any benefit, three other AD trials continued.<ref name=medpagetoday>[http://www.medpagetoday.com/Neurology/AlzheimersDisease/18794 Novel Alzheimer's Drug Flops], ''MedPage Today'', March 03, 2010</ref> Major industry-based development in this indication essentially stopped after another Phase III trial suffered the same fate in 2012.<ref name="ReferenceA">Sweetlove M: Phase III CONCERT Trial of Latrepirdine.

== Uses ==
Latrepirdine is an orally active, small molecule compound that has been shown to inhibit brain cell death in animal models of Alzheimer's disease and [[Huntington's disease]]. Research suggests it may also have cognition-enhancing effects in healthy individuals, in the absence of neurodegenerative disease pathology.<ref name="pmid11462798">{{cite journal |vauthors=Bachurin S, Bukatina E, Lermontova N, Tkachenko S, Afanasiev A, Grigoriev V, Grigorieva I, Ivanov Y, Sablin S, Zefirov N | title = Antihistamine agent Dimebon as a novel neuroprotector and a cognition enhancer | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |date=June 2001 | volume = 939  | issue = |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb03654.x| pages = 425–435 | pmid = 11462798}}</ref> However, because of negative results in human clinical trials, the drug remains unlicensed for any neurodegenerative condition.<ref name=medpagetoday /><ref name=HD/>

=== Alzheimer's disease: failed in Phase III clinical trials ===

Latrepirdine attracted renewed interest in 2009 after being shown in small preclinical trials to have positive effects on persons suffering from [[Alzheimer's]] disease. Animal studies showing potential beneficial effects on Alzheimer's disease models were shown in Russian research in 2000.<ref name="pmid11022244">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lermontova NN, Lukoyanov NV, Serkova TP, Lukoyanova EA, Bachurin SO | title = Dimebon improves learning in animals with experimental Alzheimer's disease | journal = Bulletin of Experimental Biology and Medicine |date=June 2000 | volume = 129 | issue = 6 | pages = 544–546 | pmid = 11022244 | doi=10.1007/BF02434871}}</ref> Preliminary results from human trials have also been promising.

In March 2010, the results of a clinical trial phase III were released; the investigational Alzheimer's disease drug dimebon failed in the pivotal CONNECTION trial of patients with mild-to-moderate disease.<ref>[http://www.alzforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=2387 Dimebon Disappoints in Phase 3 Trial]</ref>

With CONCERT, the remaining Pfizer and Medivation Phase III trial for latrepirdine in Alzheimer's disease failed in 2012, effectively ending the development in this indication.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

A Cochrane meta-analysis of the three pivotal phase III efficacy trials found no significant effect of latrepirdine on cognition and function in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's patients, though there appears to be a modest benefit for overall behavior disturbances.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chau|first1=Sarah A|last2=Herrmann|first2=Nathan|last3=Ruthirakuhan|first3=Myuri T|last4=Chen|first4=Jinghan J|last5=Lanctôt|first5=Krista L|title=Latrepirdine for Alzheimer's disease|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev.|date=2015|issue=4|page=CD009524|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009524.pub2|pmid=25897825}}</ref>

=== Huntington's disease ===
In April 2011, latrepirdine failed in a phase III clinical trial of patients affected with Huntington's disease.<ref name=HD>http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/phase-iii-failure-leads-medivation-and-pfizer-to-ditch-dimebon-for-huntington-disease/81244981/</ref> The trial was sponsored  by Medivation Inc. and [[Pfizer]].
