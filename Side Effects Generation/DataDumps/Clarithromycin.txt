===Cardiac===

Clarithromycin can lead to a prolonged [[QT interval]].  In patients with [[long QT syndrome]], cardiac disease, or patients taking other QT-prolonging medications, this can increase risk for life-threatening [[arrhythmia]]s.<ref>Yamaguchi S, Kaneko Y, Yamagishi T, et al. [Clarithromycin-induced torsades de pointes]. Nippon Naika Gakkai Zasshi. 2003;92(1):143–5.</ref>

In one trial, the use of short-term clarithromycin treatment was correlated with an increased incidence of deaths classified as sudden cardiac deaths in stable coronary heart disease patients not using statins.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Winkel | first1 = P. | last2 = Hilden | first2 = J.

===Liver and kidney===

Clarithromycin has been known to cause [[jaundice]], [[cirrhosis]], and kidney problems, including [[renal failure]].

===Central nervous system===

Common adverse effects of clarithromycin in the central nervous system include dizziness, headaches.  Rarely, it can cause [[ototoxicity]], delirium and mania.

===Infection===

A risk of [[oral candidiasis]] and [[vaginal candidiasis]], due to the elimination of the [[yeast|yeast's]] natural bacterial competitors by the antibiotic, is also incurred.

===Pregnancy and breastfeeding===

Clarithromycin should not be used in pregnant women except in situations where no alternative therapy is appropriate.<ref name=":0" /> Clarithromycin can cause potential hazard to the fetus hence should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.<ref name=":0" /> For lactating mothers it is not known whether clarithromycin is excreted in human milk.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/050662s044s050,50698s026s030,050775s015s019lbl.pdf|title = BIAXIN® Filmtab® (clarithromycin tablets, USP) BIAXIN® XL Filmtab® (clarithromycin extended-release tablets) BIAXIN® Granules (clarithromycin for oral suspension, USP)|date = November 2, 2015|accessdate = November 2, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150824122417/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/050662s044s050,50698s026s030,050775s015s019lbl.pdf|archivedate = August 24, 2015|df = }}</ref>

== Interactions ==

Clarithromycin inhibits a liver enzyme, [[CYP3A4]], involved in the metabolism of many other commonly prescribed drugs. Taking clarithromycin with other medications that are metabolized by CYP3A4 may lead to unexpected increases or decreases in [[CYP3A4#CYP3A4 ligands|drug]] levels.

A few of the common interactions are listed below.

===Colchicine===

Clarithromycin has been observed to have a dangerous interaction with [[colchicine]] as the result of inhibition of CYP3A4 metabolism and [[P-glycoprotein]] transport. Combining these two drugs may lead to fatal colchicine toxicity, particularly in patients with renal insufficiency.<ref name=":0" />

===Statins===

Taking clarithromycin concurrently with certain [[statins]] (a class of drugs used to reduce blood serum [[cholesterol]] levels) increases the risk of side effects, such as muscle aches and muscle break down ([[rhabdomyolysis]]).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Patel | first1 = AM | last2 = Shariff | first2 = S | last3 = Bailey | first3 = DG | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | year = 2013 | title = Statin toxicity from macrolide antibiotic coprescription: a population-based cohort study | url = | journal = Ann Intern Med | volume = 158 | issue = 12| pages = 869–76 | doi=10.7326/0003-4819-158-12-201306180-00004 | pmid=23778904}}</ref>

===Calcium channel blockers===

Concurrent therapy with [[calcium channel blocker]] may increase risk of [[Hypotension|low blood pressure]], [[kidney failure]], and death, compared to pairing calcium channel blockers with [[azithromycin]], a drug similar to clarithromycin but without CYP3A4 inhibition.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Calcium-channel blocker-clarithromycin drug interactions and acute kidney injury|journal = JAMA|date = 2013-12-18|issn = 1538-3598|pmid = 24346990|pages = 2544–2553|volume = 310|issue = 23|doi = 10.1001/jama.2013.282426|first = Sonja|last = Gandhi|first2 = Jamie L.|last2 = Fleet|first3 = David G.|last3 = Bailey|first4 = Eric|last4 = McArthur|first5 = Ron|last5 = Wald|first6 = Faisal|last6 = Rehman|first7 = Amit X.|last7 = Garg}}</ref> Administration of clarithromycin in combination with verapamil have been observed to cause [[Hypotension|low blood pressure]], [[Bradycardia|low heart rate]], and [[lactic acidosis]].<ref name=":0" />

===Carbamazepine===

Clarithromycin may double the level of [[carbamazepine]] in the body by reducing its clearance, which may lead to toxic symptoms of carbamazepine, such as [[Diplopia|double vision]], [[Ataxia|loss of body movement]], nausea, as well as [[hyponatremia]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title = [Carbamazepine and clarithromycin: a clinically relevant drug interaction]|journal = Revue Neurologique|date = 2007-11-01|issn = 0035-3787|pmid = 18033049|pages = 1096–1099|volume = 163|issue = 11|first = P.|last = Gélisse|first2 = D.|last2 = Hillaire-Buys|first3 = E.|last3 = Halaili|first4 = M.-J.|last4 = Jean-Pastor|first5 = H.|last5 = Vespignan|first6 = P.|last6 = Coubes|first7 = A.|last7 = Crespel|doi=10.1016/s0035-3787(07)74183-8}}</ref>

===HIV medications===

Depending on the combination of medications, clarithromycin therapy could be contraindicated, require changing doses of some medications, or be acceptable without dose adjustments.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sekar | first1 = VJ | last2 = Spinosa-guzman | first2 = S | last3 = De | first3 =  | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | year = 2008 | title = Darunavir/ritonavir pharmacokinetics following coadministration with clarithromycin in healthy volunteers | url = | journal = J Clin Pharmacol | volume = 48 | issue = 1| pages = 60–5 | doi=10.1177/0091270007309706}}</ref> For example, clarithromycin may lead to decreased [[zidovudine]] concentrations.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Clarithromycin lowers plasma zidovudine levels in persons with human immunodeficiency virus infection|journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy|date = 1997-08-01|issn = 0066-4804|pmc = 163990|pmid = 9257746|pages = 1709–1714|volume = 41|issue = 8|first = M.

A.|last7 = Kovacs|first8 = R. T.|last8 = Davey|first9 = R. E.|last9 = Walker}}</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==

Clarithromycin prevents [[bacteria]] by acting as a [[protein synthesis inhibitor]]. It binds to 23S rRNA, a component of the 50S subunit of the bacterial [[ribosome]], thus inhibiting the [[Translation (biology)|translation]] of [[peptide]]s.

== Pharmacokinetics ==

Unlike erythromycin, clarithromycin is acid-stable, so can be taken orally without having to be protected from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed, and diffuses into most tissues and [[phagocyte]]s. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, clarithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of clarithromycin are released; its concentration in the tissues can be over 10 times higher than in plasma. Highest concentrations are found in liver, lung tissue, and stool.

== Metabolism ==

Clarithromycin has a fairly rapid [[first-pass metabolism]] in the liver. Its major metabolites include an inactive metabolite, N-desmethylclarithromycin, and an active metabolite, 14-(''R'')-hydroxyclarithromycin. Compared to clarithromycin, 14-(''R'')-hydroxyclarithromycin is less potent against mycobacterial tuberculosis and the ''Mycobacterium avium'' complex. Clarithromycin (20%-40%) and its active metabolite (10%-15%) are excreted in urine. Of all the drugs in its class, clarithromycin has the best bioavailability at 50%, which makes it amenable to oral administration.  
Its elimination half-life is about 3 to 4 hours with 250&nbsp;mg administered every 12 h, but increased to 5 to 7 h with 500&nbsp;mg administered every 8 to 12 h.  With any of these dosing regimens, the steady-state concentration of this metabolite is generally attained within 3 to 4 days.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 1976065 | volume=18 | issue=4 | title=Metabolism and disposition of clarithromycin in man | year=1990 | journal=Drug Metab.

== History ==

Clarithromycin was invented by researchers at the Japanese drug company [[Taisho Pharmaceutical]] in 1980.<ref name=Green2008/> The product emerged through efforts to develop a version of the antibiotic [[erythromycin]] that did not experience acid instability in the digestive tract, causing side effects, such as nausea and stomachache. Taisho filed for patent protection for the drug around 1980 and subsequently introduced a branded version of its drug, called Clarith, to the Japanese market in 1991. In 1985, Taisho partnered with the American company [[Abbott Laboratories]] for the international rights, and Abbott also gained FDA approval for Biaxin in October 1991. The drug went [[Generic drug|generic]] in Europe in 2004 and in the US in mid-2005.
