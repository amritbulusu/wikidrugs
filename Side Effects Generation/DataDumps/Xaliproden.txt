Development of xaliproden for these two indications was discontinued in 2007 following analysis of [[Clinical trials|Phase III]] data. While the drug did show an effect on [[hippocampus|hippocampal]] volume (suggesting perhaps a slowing of cell loss), there was insufficient evidence for efficacy in counteracting Alzheimer's related cognitive decline. Similarly while there were some indicators of efficacy in ALS, including a small but clinically noteworthy effect on some functional parameters, the overall benefit did not reach [[statistical significance]] when results across several Phase III trials were averaged. Xaliproden remains under investigation for treatment of [[Cancer pain#Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy|chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Susman | first1 = E | title = Xaliproden lessens oxaliplatin-mediated neuropathy | journal = The Lancet Oncology | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 288 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16598880 | doi = 10.1016/S1470-2045(06)70639-8 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wolf | first1 = S | last2 = Barton | first2 = D | last3 = Kottschade | first3 = L | last4 = Grothey | first4 = A | last5 = Loprinzi | first5 = C | title = Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy: prevention and treatment strategies | journal = European Journal of Cancer | volume = 44 | issue = 11 | pages = 1507–15 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18571399 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejca.2008.04.018 }}</ref>
