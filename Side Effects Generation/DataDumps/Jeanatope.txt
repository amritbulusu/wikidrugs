'''Jeanatope''' is iodinated I-125 [[human serum albumin]], typically injected to aid in the determination of total [[blood]] and [[blood plasma|plasma]] [[volume]]. I-125 is a [[radioactive]] [[isotope]] of [[Iodine]], it decays by [[electron capture]] with a physical [[half-life]] of 60.14 days. The biologic half-life in normal individuals for I-125 has been reported to be approximately 14 days.

Iodinated I-131 albumin (Volumex, [[Daxor]]) is used for a similar purpose.
