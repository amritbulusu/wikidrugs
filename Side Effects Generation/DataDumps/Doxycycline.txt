It is used in [[prophylaxis]] against [[malaria]].  It should not be used alone for initial treatment of malaria, even when the parasite is doxycycline-sensitive, because the antimalarial effect of doxycycline is delayed.

===Spectrum of susceptibility===
Doxycycline has been used successfully to treat sexually transmitted, respiratory, and ophthalmic infections. Representative pathogenic genera include ''Chlamydia, Streptococcus, Ureaplasma, Mycoplasma'', and others. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant microorganisms.
* ''Chlamydia psittaci'': 0.03 ''μ''g/mL
* ''Mycoplasma pneumoniae'': 0.016 ''μ''g/mL — 2 ''μ''g/mL
* ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'': 0.06 ''μ''g/mL — 32 ''μ''g/mL<ref name="toku-e.com">{{cite web|title=Doxycycline hyclate Susceptibility and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) Data|url=http://www.toku-e.com/Assets/MIC/Doxycycline%20hyclate.pdf|website=toku-e.com|accessdate=April 16, 2017}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Cautions and side effects are similar to those of other members of the [[Tetracycline antibiotics|tetracycline]] antibiotic group.

An [[erythematous]] rash in sun-exposed parts of the body has been reported to occur in 7.3–21.2% of persons taking doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis. One study examined the tolerability of various malaria prophylactic regimens and found doxycycline did not cause a significantly higher percentage of all skin events (photosensitivity not specified) when compared with other antimalarials. The rash resolves upon discontinuation of the drug.<ref>{{cite web |author=Center for Global Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |title=Doxycycline for Malaria Chemoprophylaxis and Treatment: Report from the CDC Expert Meeting on Malaria Chemoprophylaxis |url=http://www.ajtmh.org/content/84/4/517.full |year=2011 |publisher=[[The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene]] |accessdate=17 May 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705202814/http://www.ajtmh.org/content/84/4/517.full |archivedate=5 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}{{Verify source|date=March 2011}}</ref>

===Interactions===
The combination of doxycycline with dairy, antacids, calcium supplements, iron products, and laxatives containing magnesium is not inherently dangerous, but any of these foods and supplements may decrease doxycycline's effectiveness.<ref>{{cite web|author=PubMed Health|title=Doxycycline (By mouth)|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0010039/?report=details|date=July 1, 2016|publisher=[[U.S. National Library of Medicine]]|accessdate=July 16, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111164820/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0010039/?report=details|archivedate=11 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

<blockquote>Breakfast was observed to reduce doxycycline absorption significantly. Absorption of tetracycline occurs in the stomach and the upper small intestine. Absorption of tetracyclines has been reported to be impaired by milk products, aluminum hydroxide gels, sodium bicarbonate, calcium and magnesium salts, laxatives containing magnesium and iron preparations. The mechanisms responsible for decreased absorption appear to be chelation and an increase in gastric pH. ... In view of these results, it is advisable to instruct the patients to take doxycycline on an empty stomach.<ref>[http://www.jpgmonline.com/article.asp?issn=0022-3859;year=1987;volume=33;issue=3;spage=117;epage=9;aulast=Kshirsagar Kshirsagar N A, Ankalesaria P S.

Previously, doxycycline was believed to impair the effectiveness of many types of [[hormonal contraception]] due to [[Cytochrome P450|CYP450]] induction. Recent research has shown no significant loss of effectiveness in oral contraceptives while using most tetracycline antibiotics (including doxycycline), although many physicians still recommend the use of barrier contraception for people taking the drug to prevent unwanted pregnancy.<ref name="pmid12063491">{{cite journal |vauthors=Archer JS, Archer DF |title=Oral contraceptive efficacy and antibiotic interaction: a myth debunked |journal=J.

===Pregnancy and lactation===
Doxycycline is categorized by the FDA as a class D drug in pregnancy. As with all tetracycline antibiotics, it is contraindicated in pregnancy through infancy and childhood up to eight years of age, due to the potential for disrupting bone and tooth development.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mylonas|first=I|title=Antibiotic chemotherapy during pregnancy and lactation period: aspects for consideration.|journal=Archives of gynecology and obstetrics|date=January 2011|volume=283|issue=1|pages=7–18|pmid=20814687|doi=10.1007/s00404-010-1646-3}}</ref> Therefore, doxycycline should not be administered to children under the age of eight except in the treatment of anthrax or where other medications are contraindicated or ineffective.<ref name="FDA capsules label"/>

Doxycycline crosses into breastmilk. The adverse effects on teeth and long bones of children directly administered tetracycline antibiotics is documented, but these effects have not been recorded in infants exposed through breastmilk. Although the dose an infant would receive through breastfeeding would likely be minimal, a theoretical risk exists.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chung|first=AM|author2=Reed, MD |author3=Blumer, JL |title=Antibiotics and breast-feeding: a critical review of the literature.|journal=Paediatric drugs|year=2002|volume=4|issue=12|pages=817–37|pmid=12431134|doi=10.2165/00128072-200204120-00006}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==
{{see also|Tetracycline antibiotics#Mechanism of action}}
Doxycycline, like other tetracycline antibiotics, is [[Bacteriostatic agent|bacteriostatic]]. It works by preventing bacteria from reproducing through the inhibition of protein synthesis.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Flower, R. |author2=Rang, H. P. |author3=Dale, M. M. |author4=Ritter, J.

Doxycycline–metal ion complexes are unstable at acid pH, therefore more doxycycline enters the duodenum for absorption than the earlier tetracycline compounds.  In addition, food has less effect on absorption than on absorption of earlier drugs with doxycycline serum concentrations being reduced by about 20% by test meals compared with 50% for tetracycline.<ref name="pmid16816396">{{cite journal |author1=Agwuh, KN |author2=MacGowan, A |title=Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the tetracyclines including glycylcyclines |journal=J.

==Chemistry==
Expired tetracyclines or tetracyclines allowed to stand at a pH less than 2 are reported to be nephrotoxic due to the formation of a degradation product, anhydro-4-epitetracycline<ref>[http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc119.htm "Principles and methods for the assessment of nephrotoxicity associated with exposure to chemicals"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510093944/http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc119.htm |date=10 May 2011 }}.

==History==
After [[penicillin]] revolutionized the treatment of bacterial infections in WWII, many chemical companies moved into the field of discovering antibiotics by [[bioprospecting]]. [[American Cyanamid]] was one of these, and in the late 1940s chemists there discovered [[chlortetracycline]], the first member of the [[tetracycline]] class of antibiotics.<ref name=Tetrahist>{{cite journal |vauthors=Nelson ML, Levy SB | date = Dec 2011 | title = The history of the tetracyclines | url = | journal = Ann N Y Acad Sci | volume = 1241 | issue = | pages = 17–32 | pmid = 22191524 | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2011.06354.x}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, scientists at Pfizer discovered [[terramycin]] and it was brought to market.  Both compounds, like penicillin, were natural products and it was commonly believed that nature had perfected them, and further chemical changes could only degrade their effectiveness.  Scientists at Pfizer led by [[Lloyd Conover]] modified these compounds, which led to the invention of tetracycline itself, the first semi-synthetic antibiotic. Charlie Stephens' group at Pfizer worked on further analogs and created one with greatly improved stability and pharmacological efficacy: doxycycline.  It was clinically developed in the early 1960s and approved by the FDA in 1967.<ref name=Tetrahist/>

===Research reagent===
Doxycycline and other members of the [[Tetracycline antibiotics|tetracycline class]] of antibiotics are often used as research [[reagent]]s in ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo'' biomedical research experiments involving bacteria as well in experiments in eukaryotic cells and organisms with inducible protein expression systems using [[tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activation]]. The mechanism of action for the antibacterial effect of tetracyclines relies on disrupting protein translation in bacteria, thereby damaging the ability of microbes to grow and repair; however protein translation is also disrupted in eukaryotic [[mitochondria]] impairing metabolism and leading to effects that can [[confound]] experimental results.<ref name="pmid25772356">{{cite journal |vauthors=Moullan N, Mouchiroud L, Wang X, Ryu D, Williams EG, Mottis A, Jovaisaite V, Frochaux MV, Quiros PM, Deplancke B, Houtkooper RH, Auwerx J|title=Tetracyclines Disturb Mitochondrial Function across Eukaryotic Models: A Call for Caution in Biomedical Research. |journal=Celll Reports |volume=10 |issue=10 |pages=1681–91 |year=2015|pmid=25772356|doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2015.02.034}}</ref><ref name="pmid26475870">{{cite journal |vauthors=Chatzispyrou IA, Held NM, Mouchiroud L, Auwerx J, Houtkooper RH |title=Tetracycline antibiotics impair mitochondrial function and its experimental use confounds research. |journal=Cancer Research |volume= 75|issue=21 |pages=4446–9|year=2015|pmid=26475870|doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-1626}}</ref>
