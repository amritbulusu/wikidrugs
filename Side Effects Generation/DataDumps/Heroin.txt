===Recreational===
The original trade name of heroin is typically used in non-medical settings. It is used as a recreational drug for the [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]] it induces. [[Anthropology|Anthropologist]] Michael Agar once described heroin as "the perfect whatever drug."<ref name="agar">{{cite book | last = Agar | first = Michael | title = Dope Double Agent: The Naked Emperor on Drugs | publisher = Lulu.com | year = 2007 | isbn = 1-4116-8103-7 | url = http://www.americanethnography.com/article_sql.php?id=95 | accessdate = 22 October 2009 | quote = What a great New York drug heroin was, I thought. Like any city, but more than most, New York is an information overload, a constant perceptual tornado that surrounds you most places you walk on the streets. Heroin is the audio-visual technology that helps manage that overload by dampening it in general and allowing a focus on some part of it that the human perceptual equipment was, in fact, designed to handle. | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091117152041/http://www.americanethnography.com/article_sql.php?id=95 | archivedate = 17 November 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> [[Physiological tolerance|Tolerance]] develops quickly, and increased doses are needed in order to achieve the same effects. Its popularity with recreational drug users, compared to [[morphine]], reportedly stems from its perceived different effects.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-002-1271-3 |title=Time series modeling of heroin and morphine drug action |date=1 January 2003 |accessdate=12 October 2013 |doi=10.1007/s00213-002-1271-3 |volume=165 |journal=Psychopharmacology |pages=188–193 |pmid=12404073 |author=Tschacher W, Haemmig R, Jacobshagen N}}</ref> In particular, users report an intense [[Rush (psychology)|rush]], an acute transcendent state of [[euphoria]], which occurs while diamorphine is being metabolized into [[6-monoacetylmorphine]] (6-MAM) and morphine in the brain. Some believe that heroin produces more euphoria than other opioids; one possible explanation is the presence of 6-monoacetylmorphine, a metabolite unique to heroin – although a more likely explanation is the rapidity of onset. While other opioids of recreational use produce only morphine, heroin also leaves 6-MAM, also a psycho-[[active metabolite]]. However, this perception is not supported by the results of clinical studies comparing the physiological and subjective effects of injected heroin and morphine in individuals formerly addicted to opioids; these subjects showed no preference for one drug over the other. Equipotent injected doses had comparable action courses, with no difference in subjects' self-rated feelings of euphoria, ambition, nervousness, relaxation, drowsiness, or sleepiness.<ref name="martin and fraser">{{cite journal |vauthors=Martin WR, Fraser HF | title = A comparative study of physiological and subjective effects of heroin and morphine administered intravenously in postaddicts | journal = Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 133 | issue =  | pages = 388–99 | date = September 1961 | pmid = 13767429 | doi =  | url = http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=13767429 }}</ref>

Short-term addiction studies by the same researchers demonstrated that tolerance developed at a similar rate to both heroin and morphine. When compared to the opioids [[hydromorphone]], [[fentanyl]], [[oxycodone]], and [[pethidine]] (meperidine), former addicts showed a strong preference for heroin and morphine, suggesting that heroin and morphine are particularly susceptible to abuse and addiction. Morphine and heroin were also much more likely to produce euphoria and other positive subjective effects when compared to these other opioids.<ref name="martin and fraser" />{{mcn|date=September 2015}}

Some researchers have attempted to explain heroin use and the culture that surrounds it through the use of sociological theories. In ''Righteous Dopefiend'', Philippe Bourgois and Jeff Schonberg use [[anomie theory]] to explain why people begin using heroin. By analyzing a community in San Francisco, they demonstrated that heroin use was caused in part by internal and external factors such as violent homes and parental neglect. This lack of emotional, social, and financial support causes strain and influences individuals to engage in deviant acts, including heroin usage.<ref name=righteous/> They further found that heroin users practiced "retreatism", a behavior first described by Howard Abadinsky, in which those suffering from such strain reject society's goals and institutionalized means of achieving them.<ref name=orgcrime>{{cite book|last=Abadinsky|first=Howard|title=Organized Crime|year=2007|publisher=Wadsworth}}</ref>

===Medical uses===
In the United States heroin is not accepted as medically useful.<ref name=Drugs2014/>

Under the generic name diamorphine, heroin is [[prescription medicine|prescribed]] as a strong [[analgesic|pain medication]] in the United Kingdom, where it is given via [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous]], [[intramuscular]], [[intrathecal]] or [[intravenous]]ly. Its use includes treatment for acute [[pain]], such as in severe [[physical trauma]], [[myocardial infarction]], post-[[surgery|surgical]] pain, and [[chronic pain]], including end-stage [[cancer]] and other [[terminal illness]]es. In other countries it is more common to use [[morphine]] or other strong [[opioids]] in these situations. In 2004 the [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] produced guidance on the management of [[caesarian section]], which recommended the use of [[intrathecal]] or [[epidural]] diamorphine for post-operative [[pain relief]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg132/chapter/1-recommendations#procedural-aspects-of-cs |title=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (2011) Caesarean section.NICE Guideline (CG132) |accessdate=28 October 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151025180200/http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg132/chapter/1-recommendations#procedural-aspects-of-cs |archivedate=25 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Diamorphine continues to be widely used in [[palliative care]] in the UK, where it is commonly given by the subcutaneous route, often via a [[syringe driver]], if patients cannot easily swallow [[morphine|morphine solution]]. The advantage of diamorphine over morphine is that diamorphine is more [[lipophilicity|fat soluble]] and therefore more potent by injection, so smaller doses of it are needed for the same effect on pain. Both of these factors are advantageous if giving high doses of opioids via the subcutaneous route, which is often necessary in palliative care.

====Maintenance therapy====
{{Main article|Heroin-assisted treatment}}
A number of European countries including the United Kingdom  allow the prescribing of heroin for [[heroin addiction]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lintzeris|first1=N|title=Prescription of heroin for the management of heroin dependence: current status.|journal=CNS Drugs|date=2009|volume=23|issue=6|pages=463–76|pmid=19480466|doi=10.2165/00023210-200923060-00002}}</ref>

Diamorphine is also used as a [[heroin maintenance|maintenance drug]] to assist the treatment of opiate addiction, normally in long-term chronic intravenous (IV) heroin users. It is only prescribed following exhaustive efforts at treatment via other means. It is sometimes thought that heroin users can walk into a clinic and walk out with a prescription, but the process takes many weeks before a prescription for diamorphine is issued. Though this is somewhat controversial among proponents of a [[zero-tolerance]] [[drug policy]], it has proven superior to [[methadone]] in improving the social and health situations of addicts.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Haasen C, Verthein U, Degkwitz P, Berger J, Krausz M, Naber D | title = Heroin-assisted treatment for opioid dependence: Randomised controlled trial | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 191 | pages = 55–62 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17602126 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.106.026112 }}</ref>

The UK Department of Health's [[Rolleston Committee]] Report<ref>{{cite web|title=Rolleston Report|url=http://www.drugtext.org/Table/Rolleston-Report/|publisher=Departmental Commission on Morphine and Heroin Addiction, United Kingdom|accessdate=28 January 2011|year=1926|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417125310/http://www.drugtext.org/Table/Rolleston-Report/|archivedate=17 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> in 1926 established the British approach to diamorphine prescription to users, which was maintained for the next 40 years: dealers were prosecuted, but doctors could prescribe diamorphine to users when withdrawing from it would cause harm or severe distress to the patient. This "policing and prescribing" policy effectively controlled the perceived diamorphine problem in the UK until 1959 when the number of diamorphine addicts doubled every 16 months during the ten years from 1959 to 1968.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rns.se/swedish-addiction.asp |title=Nils Bejerot: The Swedish Addiction Epidemic in global perspective |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622121241/http://www.rns.se/swedish-addiction.asp |archivedate=22 June 2007}}</ref> In 1964 the [[Brain Committee]] recommended that only selected approved doctors working at approved specialised centres be allowed to prescribe diamorphine and benzoylmethylecgonine ([[cocaine]]) to users. The law was made more restrictive in 1968. Beginning in the 1970s, the emphasis shifted to abstinence and the use of methadone; currently only a small number of users in the UK are prescribed diamorphine.<ref>{{cite web| last =Goldacre| first =Ben| year =1998| url =http://www.badscience.net/?p=327| title =Methadone and Heroin: An Exercise in Medical Scepticism| accessdate =18 December 2006| deadurl =no| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070304065723/http://www.badscience.net/?p=327| archivedate =4 March 2007| df =dmy-all}}</ref>

In 1994 Switzerland began a trial [[heroin-assisted treatment|diamorphine maintenance]] program for users that had failed multiple withdrawal programs. The aim of this program was to maintain the health of the user by avoiding medical problems stemming from the illicit use of diamorphine.

The onset of heroin's effects depends upon the [[route of administration]]. Studies have shown that the subjective pleasure of drug use (the reinforcing component of addiction) is proportional to the rate at which the blood level of the drug increases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/301/2/690.full.pdf |title=Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (JPET) &#124; Onset of Action and Drug Reinforcement |format=PDF |accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref> Intravenous injection is the fastest route of drug administration, causing blood concentrations to rise the most quickly, followed by smoking, [[suppository]] (anal or vaginal insertion), [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflation]] (snorting), and [[ingestion]] (swallowing).

Ingestion does not produce a [[Rush (psychology)|rush]] as forerunner to the high experienced with the use of heroin, which is most pronounced with intravenous use. While the onset of the rush induced by injection can occur in as little as a few seconds, the oral route of administration requires approximately half an hour before the high sets in. Thus, with both higher the dosage of heroin used and faster the route of administration used, the higher potential risk for psychological addiction.

Large doses of heroin can cause fatal respiratory depression, and the drug has been used for suicide or as a murder weapon. The serial killer [[Harold Shipman]] used diamorphine on his victims, and the subsequent [[Shipman Inquiry]] led to a tightening of the regulations surrounding the storage, prescribing and destruction of controlled drugs in the UK. [[John Bodkin Adams]] is also known to have used heroin as a murder weapon.

Because significant tolerance to respiratory depression develops quickly with continued use and is lost just as quickly during withdrawal,{{mcn|date=May 2016}} it is often difficult to determine whether a heroin lethal overdose was accidental, suicide or homicide. Examples include the overdose deaths of [[Sid Vicious]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Tim Buckley]], [[Hillel Slovak]], [[Layne Staley]], [[Bradley Nowell]], [[Ted Binion]], and [[River Phoenix]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,11069-2329203,00.html |title=First murder charge over heroin mix that killed 400|publisher=Times Online |date=13 March 2012 |accessdate=20 July 2012 |first1=Kevin |last1=Eason |first2=Philippe |last2=Naughton |location=London}}</ref><!-- more information needed! -->

Chronic use of heroin and other opioids has been shown to be a potential cause of [[hyponatremia]], resultant because of excess [[vasopressin]] secretion.

===Oral===
Oral use of heroin is less common than other methods of administration, mainly because there is little to no "rush", and the effects are less potent.<ref>{{cite web |author=sepulfreak |url=http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=41495 |title=Erowid Experience Vaults: Heroin – Catching the Waves – 41495 |publisher=Erowid.org |date=8 July 2005 |accessdate=20 July 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011062609/http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=41495 |archivedate=11 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Heroin is entirely converted to [[morphine]] by means of [[first-pass metabolism]], resulting in [[deacetylation]] when ingested. Heroin's oral bioavailability is both dose-dependent (as is morphine's) and significantly higher than oral use of morphine itself, reaching up to 64.2% for high doses and 45.6% for low doses; opiate-naive users showed far less absorption of the drug at low doses, having bioavailabilities of only up to 22.9%. The maximum plasma concentration of morphine following oral administration of heroin was around twice as much as that of oral morphine.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Halbsguth U, Rentsch KM, Eich-Höchli D, Diterich I, Fattinger K | title = Oral diacetylmorphine (heroin) yields greater morphine bioavailability than oral morphine: Bioavailability related to dosage and prior opioid exposure | journal = British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 66 | issue = 6 | pages = 781–791 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18945270 | pmc = 2675771 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2125.2008.03286.x }}</ref>

===Injection===
[[Drug injection|Injection]], also known as "slamming", "banging", "shooting up", "digging" or "mainlining", is a popular method which carries relatively greater risks than other methods of administration. Heroin base (commonly found in Europe), when prepared for injection, will only dissolve in water when mixed with an acid (most commonly citric acid powder or lemon juice) and heated. Heroin in the east-coast United States is most commonly found in the hydrochloride salt form, requiring just water (and no heat) to dissolve. Users tend to initially inject in the easily accessible arm veins, but as these veins collapse over time, users resort to more dangerous areas of the body, such as the [[femoral vein]] in the groin. Users who have used this route of administration often develop a [[deep vein thrombosis]].{{medcn|date=April 2014}} Intravenous users can use a various single dose range using a [[hypodermic needle]]. The dose of heroin used for recreational purposes is dependent on the frequency and level of use: thus a first-time user may use between 5 and 20&nbsp;mg, while an established addict may require several hundred mg per day. As with the injection of any drug, if a group of users [[needle sharing|share a common needle]] without sterilization procedures, blood-borne diseases, such as [[HIV/AIDS]] or [[hepatitis]], can be transmitted.
The use of a common dispenser for water for the use in the preparation of the injection, as well as the sharing of spoons and/or filters can also cause the spread of blood-borne diseases. Many countries now supply small sterile spoons and filters for single use in order to prevent the spread of disease.<ref>http://www.idaat.org/files/documents_file-4.pdf {{dead link |date=July 2017 }}</ref>

===Smoking===
Smoking heroin refers to vaporizing it to inhale the resulting fumes, not burning it to inhale the resulting smoke. It is commonly smoked in glass pipes made from [[glassblowing|glassblown]] [[Pyrex|Pyrex tubes]] and light bulbs. It can also be smoked off aluminium foil, which is heated underneath by a flame and the resulting smoke is inhaled through a tube of rolled up foil. This method is also known as "[[chasing the dragon]]".{{Citation needed|reason=Talk page - Unclear/Unsources possibly Unnecessary/Wrong part of article|date=August 2017}}

===Insufflation===
Another popular route to intake heroin is [[insufflation]] (snorting), where a user crushes the heroin into a fine powder and then gently inhales it (sometimes with a straw or a rolled-up [[banknote]], as with cocaine) into the nose, where heroin is absorbed through the soft tissue in the [[mucous membrane]] of the [[sinus cavity]] and straight into the bloodstream. This method of administration redirects [[First pass effect|first-pass metabolism]], with a quicker onset and higher bioavailability than oral administration, though the duration of action is shortened. This method is sometimes preferred by users who do not want to prepare and administer heroin for injection or smoking, but still experience a fast onset. Snorting heroin becomes an often unwanted route, once a user begins to inject the drug. The user may still get high on the drug from snorting, and experience a nod, but will not get a rush. A "rush" is caused by a large amount of heroin entering the body at once. When the drug is taken in through the nose, the user does not get the rush because the drug is absorbed slowly rather than instantly.

===Suppository===
Little research has been focused on the [[suppository]] (anal insertion) or [[pessary]] (vaginal insertion) methods of administration, also known as "plugging". These methods of administration are commonly carried out using an [[oral syringe]]. Heroin can be dissolved and withdrawn into an oral syringe which may then be lubricated and inserted into the anus or vagina before the plunger is pushed. The rectum or the vaginal canal is where the majority of the drug would likely be taken up, through the membranes lining their walls.

==Adverse effects==

Many countries and local governments have begun funding programs that supply [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]] needles to people who inject illegal drugs in an attempt to reduce these contingent risks, and especially the spread of blood-borne diseases.

Anthropologists [[Philippe Bourgois]] and Jeff Schonberg performed a decade of fieldwork among homeless heroin and cocaine addicts in San Francisco, published in 2009. They reported that the African-American addicts they observed were more inclined to "direct deposit" heroin into a vein, while "[[Skin popping|skin-popping]]" was a far more widespread practice: "By the midpoint of our fieldwork, most of the whites had given up searching for operable veins and skin-popped. They sank their needles perfunctorily, often through their clothing, into their fatty tissue." Bourgois and Schonberg describes how the cultural difference between the African-Americans and the whites leads to this contrasting behavior, and also points out that the two different ways to inject heroin comes with different health risks. Skin-popping more often results in abscesses, and direct injection more often leads to fatal overdose and also to [[hepatitis C]] and HIV infection.<ref name=righteous>{{cite book | last = Bourgois | first = Philippe | author2 = Jeff Schonberg | title = Righteous Dopefiend | url = http://www.americanethnography.com/article.php?id=92 | accessdate = 13 October 2009 | year = 2009 | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley and Los Angeles | isbn = 0-520-25498-8 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101202063245/http://www.americanethnography.com/article.php?id=92 | archivedate = 2 December 2010 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

A small percentage of heroin smokers, and occasionally IV users, may develop symptoms of [[toxic leukoencephalopathy]].

[[Cocaine]] is sometimes used in combination with heroin, and is referred to as a [[speedball (drug)|speedball]] when injected or ''moonrocks'' when smoked together. Cocaine acts as a [[stimulant]], whereas heroin acts as a [[depressant]]. Coadministration provides an intense rush of [[euphoria]] with a high that combines both effects of the drugs, while excluding the negative effects, such as [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] and [[sedation]]. The effects of cocaine wear off far more quickly than heroin, so if an overdose of heroin was used to compensate for cocaine, the end result is fatal [[respiratory depression]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Withdrawal===
{{Main article|Opioid withdrawal}}
The [[drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] syndrome from heroin (the so-called "[[cold turkey]]") may begin within 6–24&nbsp;hours of discontinuation of the drug; however, this time frame can fluctuate with the degree of tolerance as well as the amount of the last consumed dose.

==Overdose==
Heroin overdose is usually treated with an [[opioid antagonist]], such as [[naloxone]] (Narcan), or [[naltrexone]]. This reverses the effects of heroin and other opioids and causes an immediate return of consciousness but may result in [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms. The [[half-life]] of naloxone is shorter than most opioids, so that it has to be administered multiple times until the opioid has been metabolized by the body.

Depending on drug interactions and numerous other factors, death from overdose can take anywhere from several minutes to several hours. Death usually occurs due to [[Hypoxia (medical)|lack of oxygen]] resulting from the lack of breathing caused by the opioid. Heroin overdoses can occur because of an unexpected increase in the dose or purity or because of diminished opioid tolerance. However, many fatalities reported as overdoses are probably caused by interactions with other [[depressant]] drugs such as alcohol or [[benzodiazepine]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Darke S, Zador D | title = Fatal heroin 'overdose': a review | journal = Addiction | volume = 91 | issue = 12 | pages = 1765–1772 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8997759 | doi = 10.1046/j.1360-0443.1996.911217652.x }}</ref> It should also be noted that since heroin can cause nausea and vomiting, a significant number of deaths attributed to heroin overdose are caused by aspiration of vomit by an unconscious person.

This means that the user may prepare what they consider to be a moderate dose while actually taking far more than intended. Also, tolerance typically decreases after a period of abstinence. If this occurs and the user takes a dose comparable to their previous use, the user may experience drug effects that are much greater than expected, potentially resulting in an overdose.

==Pharmacology==
[[File:Heroin black tar.jpg|thumb|[[Black tar heroin]]]]

Both morphine and 6-MAM are [[Mu opioid receptor|μ-opioid]] [[agonist]]s that bind to receptors present throughout the brain, [[spinal cord]], and [[Gut (zoology)|gut]] of all [[mammal]]s. The μ-opioid receptor also binds endogenous [[opioid peptide]]s such as [[Beta-endorphin|β-endorphin]], [[Leu-enkephalin]], and [[Met-enkephalin]]. Repeated use of heroin results in a number of physiological changes, including an increase in the production of μ-opioid receptors (upregulation).{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} These physiological alterations lead to tolerance and dependence, so that stopping heroin use results in uncomfortable symptoms including pain, anxiety, muscle spasms, and insomnia called the opioid [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] syndrome. Depending on usage it has an onset 4–24&nbsp;hours after the last dose of heroin. Morphine also binds to [[delta opioid receptor|δ]]- and [[kappa opioid receptor|κ]]-opioid receptors.

There is also evidence that 6-MAM binds to a subtype of μ-opioid receptors that are also activated by the morphine metabolite morphine-6β-glucuronide but not morphine itself.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Brown GP, Yang K, King MA, Rossi GC, Leventhal L, Chang A, Pasternak GW | title = 3-Methoxynaltrexone, a selective heroin/morphine-6β-glucuronide antagonist | journal = FEBS Letters | volume = 412 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–8 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9257684 | doi = 10.1016/S0014-5793(97)00710-2 }}</ref> The third subtype of third opioid type is the mu-3 receptor, which may be a commonality to other six-position monoesters of morphine. The contribution of these receptors to the overall pharmacology of heroin remains unknown.

A subclass of morphine derivatives, namely the 3,6 esters of morphine, with similar effects and uses, includes the clinically used strong analgesics [[nicomorphine]] (Vilan), and [[dipropanoylmorphine]]; there is also the latter's [[dihydromorphine]] analogue, [[diacetyldihydromorphine]] (Paralaudin). Two other 3,6 diesters of morphine invented in 1874–75 along with diamorphine, [[dibenzoylmorphine]] and [[acetylpropionylmorphine]], were made as substitutes after it was outlawed in 1925 and, therefore, sold as the first "[[designer drugs]]" until they were outlawed by the League of Nations in 1930.

==Chemistry==
Heroin is derived from [[opium]] through a process involving various chemicals such as [[acetone]] and [[acetic anhydride]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/pdf/research/Bulletin07/bulletin_on_narcotics_2007_Zerell.pdf|title=Documentation of a heroin manufacturing process in Afghanistan.

===Detection in body fluids===
The major metabolites of diamorphine, 6-MAM, morphine, morphine-3-glucuronide and morphine-6-glucuronide, may be quantitated in blood, plasma or urine to monitor for abuse, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Most commercial opiate screening tests cross-react appreciably with these metabolites, as well as with other biotransformation products likely to be present following usage of street-grade diamorphine such as 6-acetylcodeine and codeine. However, chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish and measure each of these substances. When interpreting the results of a test, it is important to consider the diamorphine usage history of the individual, since a chronic user can develop tolerance to doses that would incapacitate an opiate-naive individual, and the chronic user often has high baseline values of these metabolites in his system. Furthermore, some testing procedures employ a hydrolysis step before quantitation that converts many of the metabolic products to morphine, yielding a result that may be 2&nbsp;times larger than with a method that examines each product individually.<ref>{{cite book |first=R. |last=Baselt |title=Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man |edition=9th |publisher=Biomedical Publications |location=Seal Beach, CA |year=2011 |pages=793–7 |isbn=978-0-9626523-8-7}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:BayerHeroin.png|thumb|Advertisement for [[Bayer]] Heroin]]

{{see also|History of opium in China}}

The [[opium poppy]] was cultivated in lower [[Mesopotamia]] as long ago as 3400 BCE.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/heroin/etc/history.html|title=Opium Throughout History|publisher=PBS Frontline|accessdate=22 October 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923053042/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/heroin/etc/history.html|archivedate=23 September 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The chemical analysis of [[opium]] in the 19th century revealed that most of its activity could be ascribed to two [[alkaloids]], [[codeine]] and [[morphine]].

Diamorphine was first synthesized in 1874 by [[C. R. Alder Wright]], an English chemist working at [[St Mary's Hospital (London)|St. Mary's Hospital]] Medical School in London. He had been experimenting with combining morphine with various acids. He boiled anhydrous morphine alkaloid with [[acetic anhydride]] for several hours and produced a more potent, [[acetylated]] form of morphine, now called ''diacetylmorphine'' or ''morphine diacetate''. The compound was sent to F. M. Pierce of Owens College in Manchester for analysis. Pierce told Wright:

{{quote|Doses&nbsp;... were [[Route of administration|subcutaneously injected]] into young dogs and rabbits&nbsp;... with the following general results&nbsp;... great [[prostration]], fear, and sleepiness speedily following the administration, the eyes being sensitive, and pupils constrict, considerable [[salivation]] being produced in dogs, and slight tendency to vomiting in some cases, but no actual [[emesis]]. [[Respiration (physiology)|Respiration]] was at first quickened, but subsequently reduced, and the heart's action was diminished, and rendered irregular.

Wright's invention did not lead to any further developments, and diamorphine became popular only after it was independently re-synthesized 23 years later by another chemist, [[Felix Hoffmann]].<ref name="CHFBio">{{cite web|title=Felix Hoffmann|url=https://www.chemheritage.org/historical-profile/felix-hoffmann|website=Chemical Heritage Foundation|accessdate=18 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230055049/https://www.chemheritage.org/historical-profile/felix-hoffmann|archivedate=30 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Hoffmann, working at [[Bayer]] pharmaceutical company in [[Elberfeld]], Germany, was instructed by his supervisor [[Heinrich Dreser]] to acetylate morphine with the objective of producing [[codeine]], a constituent of the opium poppy, pharmacologically similar to morphine but less potent and less addictive. Instead, the experiment produced an acetylated form of morphine one and a half to two times more potent than morphine itself. The head of Bayer's research department reputedly coined the drug's new name, "heroin," based on the German ''heroisch'', which means "heroic, strong" (from the ancient Greek word "heros, ήρως"). Bayer scientists were not the first to make heroin, but their scientists discovered ways to make it, and Bayer led commercialization of heroin.<ref>Jim Edwards for Business Insider. 17&nbsp;November 2011 [http://www.businessinsider.com/yes-bayer-promoted-heroin-for-children-here-are-the-ads-that-prove-it-2011-11  Yes, Bayer Promoted Heroin for Children – Here Are The Ads That Prove It] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501031210/http://www.businessinsider.com/yes-bayer-promoted-heroin-for-children-here-are-the-ads-that-prove-it-2011-11 |date=1 May 2015 }}</ref>

In 1895, the German drug company [[Bayer]] marketed diacetylmorphine as an [[over-the-counter drug]] under the trademark name Heroin.<ref name="etymonline.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=heroin|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=Etymonline.com|accessdate=20 October 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515083725/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=heroin|archivedate=15 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It was developed chiefly as a [[morphine]] substitute for [[Cough medicine|cough suppressants]] that did not have morphine's addictive side-effects. Morphine at the time was a popular recreational drug, and Bayer wished to find a similar but non-addictive substitute to market. However, contrary to Bayer's advertising as a "non-addictive morphine substitute," heroin would soon have one of the highest rates of [[addiction]] among its users.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugrehabtreatment.com/most-addictive-drugs.html|title=The Most Addictive Drugs|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213101818/http://www.drugrehabtreatment.com/most-addictive-drugs.html|archivedate=13 February 2010}}</ref>

In the U.S., the [[Harrison Narcotics Tax Act]] was passed in 1914 to control the sale and distribution of diacetylmorphine and other opioids, which allowed the drug to be prescribed and sold for medical purposes. In 1924, the United States Congress banned its sale, importation, or manufacture. It is now a [[Schedule I controlled substance|Schedule I substance]], which makes it illegal for non-medical use in signatory nations of the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] treaty, including the United States.

The Health Committee of the [[League of Nations]] banned diacetylmorphine in 1925, although it took more than three years for this to be implemented. In the meantime, the first [[designer drugs]], viz. 3,6 diesters and 6 monoesters of morphine and acetylated analogues of closely related drugs like [[hydromorphone]] and [[dihydromorphine]], were produced in massive quantities to fill the worldwide demand for diacetylmorphine—this continued until 1930 when the Committee banned diacetylmorphine analogues with no therapeutic advantage over drugs already in use, the first major legislation of this type.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Bayer lost some of its trademark rights to heroin under the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]] following the German defeat in [[World War I]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Legal status===

====Asia====
In Hong Kong, diamorphine is regulated under Schedule 1 of [[Hong Kong]]'s Chapter 134 ''Dangerous Drugs Ordinance''. It is available by prescription. Anyone supplying diamorphine without a valid prescription can be fined $10,000 ([[Hong Kong dollar|HKD]]). The penalty for trafficking or manufacturing diamorphine is a $50,000 (HKD) fine and life imprisonment. Possession of diamorphine without a license from the Department of Health is illegal with a $10,000 (HKD) fine and/or 7 years of jail time.<ref>{{cite web|title=HEROIN, THE POPPY|url=http://www.addiction-recovery-expose.com/heroin.html|work=Addiction Recovery Expose|publisher=Randolph Online Solutions Inc|accessdate=27 May 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822084042/http://www.addiction-recovery-expose.com/heroin.html|archivedate=22 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

====Europe====
In the Netherlands, diamorphine is a List I drug of the [[Opium Law]]. It is available for prescription under tight regulation exclusively to long-term addicts for whom [[methadone maintenance]] treatment has failed. It cannot be used to treat severe [[pain]] or other illnesses.<ref>{{cite web|title=Heroin|url=http://www.mahalo.com/heroin/|work=Mahalo.com|publisher=Mahalo.com Incorporated|accessdate=27 May 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808032559/http://www.mahalo.com/heroin/|archivedate=8 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>{{better source|date=July 2015}}

In the United Kingdom, diamorphine is available by prescription, though it is a restricted [[Class A drug]]. According to the 50th edition of the [[British National Formulary]] (BNF), diamorphine [[hydrochloride]] may be used in the treatment of acute pain, [[myocardial infarction]], acute [[pulmonary oedema]], and [[chronic pain]]. The treatment of chronic non-[[malignant]] pain must be supervised by a specialist. The BNF notes that all opioid analgesics cause dependence and tolerance but that this is "no deterrent in the control of pain in terminal illness". When used in the [[palliative care]] of cancer patients, diamorphine is often injected using a [[syringe driver]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Heroin|url=http://www.nacada.go.ke/drugs/heroin/|work=NACADA|publisher=NACADA|accessdate=27 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203073833/http://www.nacada.go.ke/drugs/heroin/ |archivedate=3 December 2012}}</ref>

It is controlled in the UK by the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]]. In the UK it is a class A [[controlled drug]] and as such is subject to guidelines surrounding its storage, administration and destruction. Possession of diamorphine without a prescription is an arrestable offence. When diamorphine is prescribed in a hospital or similar environment, its administration must be supervised by two people who must then complete and sign a controlled drugs register (CD register) detailing the patient's name, amount, time, date and route of administration. In the case of a [[physician]] administering diamorphine, then he/she may administer the drug alone, however the rule requiring two registered practitioners, such as a [[nurse]], [[midwife]] or another physician to sign the CD register still applies. The use of a witness when administering diamorphine is to avoid the possibility of the drug being diverted onto the [[black market]].

For safety reasons, many UK [[National Health Service]] hospitals only permit the administration of intravenous diamorphine in designated areas. In practice this usually means a [[critical care unit]], an [[accident and emergency]] department, [[operating theatre]]s by an [[anaesthetist]] or [[nurse anaesthetist]] or other such areas where close monitoring and support from senior staff is immediately available. However, administration by other routes is permitted in other areas of the hospital. This includes subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenously as part of a [[patient controlled analgesia]] setup, and as an already established [[epidural]] [[infusion|infusion pump]].

====Production====
Diamorphine is produced from acetylation of morphine derived from natural opium sources. Numerous mechanical and chemical means are used to purify the final product. The final products have a different appearance depending on purity and have different names.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/pdf/research/Bulletin07/bulletin_on_narcotics_2007_Zerell.pdf|title=Documentation of a heroin manufacturing process in Afghanistan.

Conviction for trafficking heroin carries the death penalty in most [[Southeast Asian]], some [[East Asian]] and Middle Eastern countries (see [[Use of death penalty worldwide]] for details), among which [[Malaysia]], Singapore and [[Thailand]] are the most strict. The penalty applies even to citizens of countries where the penalty is not in place, sometimes causing controversy when foreign visitors are arrested for trafficking, for example the arrest of [[Bali Nine|nine Australians in Bali]], the [[death sentence]] given to [[Nola Blake]] in Thailand in 1987, or the hanging of an Australian citizen [[Van Tuong Nguyen]] in Singapore.

====Trafficking history====
[[File:HeroinWorld-en.svg|thumb|400px|Primary worldwide producers of heroin]]

The origins of the present international illegal heroin trade can be traced back to laws passed in many countries in the early 1900s that closely regulated the production and sale of opium and its derivatives including heroin. At first, heroin flowed from countries where it was still legal into countries where it was no longer legal. By the mid-1920s, heroin production had been made illegal in many parts of the world. An illegal trade developed at that time between heroin labs in China (mostly in Shanghai and Tianjin) and other nations. The weakness of government in China and conditions of civil war enabled heroin production to take root there. Chinese [[Triad society|triad]] gangs eventually came to play a major role in the illicit heroin trade. The [[French Connection]] route started in the 1930s.

Heroin trafficking was virtually eliminated in the U.S. during [[World War II]] because of temporary trade disruptions caused by the war. Japan's war with China had cut the normal distribution routes for heroin and the war had generally disrupted the movement of opium. After World War II, [[the Mafia]] took advantage of the weakness of the postwar Italian government and set up heroin labs in Sicily. The Mafia took advantage of Sicily's location along the historic route opium took westward into Europe and the United States.<ref>Eric C. Schneider, ''Smack:  Heroin and the American City'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008, chapter one</ref> Large-scale international heroin production effectively ended in China with the victory of the communists in the civil war in the late 1940s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} The elimination of Chinese production happened at the same time that Sicily's role in the trade developed.

Although it remained legal in some countries until after World War II, health risks, addiction, and widespread recreational use led most western countries to declare heroin a controlled substance by the latter half of the 20th century. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the [[CIA]] supported anti-Communist Chinese Nationalists settled near the [[China|Sino]]-Burmese border and [[Hmong people|Hmong]] tribesmen in [[Laos]]. This helped the development of the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] opium production region, which supplied about one-third of heroin consumed in US after the 1973 American withdrawal from Vietnam. In 1999, Burma, the heartland of the Golden Triangle, was the second largest producer of heroin, after [[Afghanistan]].<ref name="Afghan_Burmese_heroin">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1590827.stm|title=War Views: Afghan heroin trade will live on.|date=October 2001|work=Richard Davenport-Hines|publisher=BBC|accessdate=30 October 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115095732/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1590827.stm|archivedate=15 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The Soviet-Afghan war led to increased production in the Pakistani-Afghan border regions, as U.S.-backed [[mujaheddin]] militants raised money for arms from selling opium, contributing heavily to the modern [[Golden Crescent]] creation. By 1980, 60 percent of heroin sold in the U.S. originated in Afghanistan.<ref name="Afghan_Burmese_heroin"/> It increased international production of heroin at lower prices in the 1980s. The trade shifted away from Sicily in the late 1970s as various criminal organizations violently fought with each other over the trade. The fighting also led to a stepped-up government law enforcement presence in Sicily.

Following the discovery at a Jordanian airport of a [[toner cartridge]] that had been modified into an [[improvised explosive device]], the resultant increased level of airfreight scrutiny led to a major shortage (drought) of heroin from October 2010 until April 2011. This was reported in most of mainland Europe and the UK which led to a price increase of approximately 30 percent in the cost of street heroin and an increased demand for diverted [[methadone]]. The number of addicts seeking treatment also increased significantly during this period. Other heroin droughts (shortages) have been attributed to cartels restricting supply in order to force a price increase and also to a fungus that attacked the opium crop of 2009. Many people{{weasel inline|date=April 2014}} thought that the American government had introduced pathogens into the Afghanistan atmosphere in order to destroy the opium crop and thus starve insurgents of income.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

[[Harm reduction]] is a public health philosophy that seeks to reduce the harms associated with the use of diamorphine. One aspect of harm reduction initiatives focuses on the behaviour of individual users. This includes promoting safer means of taking the drug, such as smoking, nasal use, oral or rectal insertion. This attempts to avoid the higher risks of overdose, infections and [[Blood-borne disease|blood-borne viruses]] associated with injecting the drug. Other measures include using a small amount of the drug first to gauge the strength, and minimize the risks of overdose. For the same reason, [[poly drug use]] (the use of two or more drugs at the same time) is discouraged. Injecting diamorphine users are encouraged to use new needles, syringes, spoons/steri-cups and filters every time they inject and not share these with other users. Users are also encouraged to not use it on their own, as others can assist in the event of an overdose.

Governments that support a harm reduction approach usually fund [[needle-exchange programme|needle and syringe exchange programs]], which supply new needles and syringes on a confidential basis, as well as education on proper filtering before injection, safer injection techniques, safe disposal of used injecting gear and other equipment used when preparing diamorphine for injection may also be supplied including citric acid sachets/vitamin C sachets, steri-cups, filters, alcohol pre-injection swabs, sterile water ampules and tourniquets (to stop use of shoe laces or belts).

Another harm reduction measure employed for example in Europe, Canada and Australia are [[safe injection sites]] where users can inject diamorphine and [[cocaine]] under the supervision of medically trained staff. Safe injection sites are low threshold and allow social services to approach problem users that would otherwise be hard to reach.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kimber J, Dolan K, Wodak A | title = Survey of drug consumption rooms: service delivery and perceived public health and amenity impact | journal = Drug and Alcohol Review | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–4 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16191717 | doi = 10.1080/09595230500125047 }}</ref>
In the UK the Criminal Justice System has a protocol in place that requires that any individual that is arrested and is suspected of having a substance misuse problem be offered the chance to enter a treatment program. This has had the effect of drastically reducing an area's crime rate as individuals arrested for theft in order to supply the funds for their drugs are no longer in the position of having to steal to purchase heroin because they have been placed onto a [[methadone]] program, quite often more quickly than would have been possible had they not been arrested. This aspect of harm reduction is seen as being beneficial to both the individual and the community at large, who are then protected from the possible theft of their goods.<ref>http://www.idaat.org/files/newsletters_file-8.pdf</ref><ref>Lancashire Constabulary-Harm Reduction in the Community page 7</ref>
