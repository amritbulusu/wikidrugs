'''4-Hydroxy-''N''-methyl-''N''-propyltryptamine''', commonly known as '''4-HO-MPT''' or '''meprocin''', is a [[psychedelic drug]] in the [[tryptamine]] class of [[chemical compound]]s and is a higher [[Homology (chemistry)|homologue]] of the naturally occurring substituted tryptamine [[psilocin]] as well as being the 4-[[hydroxyl]] [[structural analog|analog]] of [[N-methyl-N-propyltryptamine|MPT]]. 

==History==
4-HO-MPT was first synthesized and [[bioassay]]ed by [[biochemist]] [[Alexander Shulgin]] and written about in his 1994 book ''[[TiHKAL]]''.<ref name="TiHKAL">[https://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal23.shtml 4-HO-MPT Entry in ''TIHKAL'' @ Erowid.org]</ref>

==Dosage and duration==
For psychedelic effects, the dosage and duration are listed as "unknown" in TiHKAL.<ref name="TiHKAL"></ref>

==Effects==
Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 4-HO-MPT.  In a single trial of 8 mg orally of 4-HO-MPT HCl from TiHKAL, it is described as producing visual distortion, [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], and slight [[insomnia]].<ref name="TiHKAL"></ref>

==Legal status==
4-HO-MPT is not scheduled by the [[United Nations]]' [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]].<ref name="UNCPS">[https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/commissions/CND/conventions.html Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971]</ref>

===United States===
4-HO-MPT is not [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedules of controlled substances|scheduled]] at the [[Federal government of the United States|federal level]] in the [[United States]],<ref name="PART 1308 — SCHEDULES OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES - 1308.11 Schedule I">[http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1308/1308_11.htm §1308.11 Schedule I.]</ref> but it is possible that 4-HO-MPT could legally be considered an [[Structural analog#Chemistry|analog]] of [[psilocin]], in which case, sales or [[Drug possession|possession]] with intent for human consumption could potentially be prosecuted under the [[Federal Analogue Act]].<ref>[https://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/law/analog/analog_info1.shtml Erowid Analog Law Vault : Federal Controlled Substance Analogue Act Summary]</ref>
