[[Intravenous]] aciclovir is effective to treat severe medical conditions caused by different species of the herpes virus family, including severe localized infections of herpes virus, severe genital herpes, [[chickenpox]] and herpetic [[encephalitis]]. It is also effective in systemic or traumatic herpes infections, eczema herpeticum and ''[[Herpes simplex]]'' meningitis.

Aciclovir is excreted in the breast milk, therefore it is recommended that caution should be used in breast-feeding women.  It has been shown in limited test studies that the nursing infant is exposed to approximately 0.3&nbsp;mg/kg/day following oral administration of aciclovir to the mother. If nursing mothers have herpetic lesions near or on the breast, breast-feeding should be avoided.<ref name=Label/><ref>Gartner LM, Morton J, Lawrence RA, et al, "Breastfeeding and the Use of Human Milk," ''Pediatrics'', 2005, 115(2):496-506</ref>

== Adverse effects ==

===Systemic therapy===
Common [[adverse drug reaction]]s (≥1% of patients) associated with systemic aciclovir therapy (oral or IV) include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, [[encephalopathy]] (with IV use only), injection site reactions (with IV use only) and headache. In high doses, [[hallucination]]s have been reported. Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of patients) include agitation, [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], confusion, dizziness, [[oedema]], [[arthralgia]], sore throat, constipation, abdominal pain, hair loss, rash and weakness. Rare adverse effects (<0.1% of patients) include coma, seizures, [[neutropenia]], [[leukopenia]], [[crystalluria]], [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], fatigue, [[hepatitis]], [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]], [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]], [[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]] and [[anaphylaxis]].<ref name="AMH" />

Intravenous aciclovir may cause reversible nephrotoxicity in up to 5% to 10% of patients because of precipitation of aciclovir crystals in the kidney. Aciclovir crystalline nephropathy is more common when aciclovir is given as a rapid infusion and in patients with dehydration and preexisting renal impairment. Adequate hydration, a slower rate of infusion, and dosing based on renal function may reduce this risk.<ref name=razonable>{{cite journal|last=Razonable|first=RR|title=Antiviral drugs for viruses other than human immunodeficiency virus|journal=Mayo Clinic proceedings.

===Topical therapy===
Aciclovir topical cream is commonly associated (≥1% of patients) with: dry or flaking skin or transient stinging/burning sensations. Infrequent adverse effects include [[erythema]] or itch.<ref name="AMH" /> When applied to the eye, aciclovir is commonly associated (≥1% of patients) with transient mild stinging.

==Drug interactions==
Ketoconazole: In-vitro replication studies have found a synergistic, dose-dependent antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 when given with aciclovir.  However, this effect has not been clinically established and more studies need to be done to evaluate the true potential of this synergy.<ref>{{cite journal | first1 = J.

Aciclovir is converted by viral [[thymidine kinase]] to aciclovir monophosphate, which is then converted by host cell [[kinases]] to aciclovir triphosphate (ACV-TP).<ref name = TGA/> ACV-TP, in turn, competitively inhibits and inactivates HSV-specified [[DNA polymerases]] preventing further viral DNA synthesis without affecting the normal cellular processes.<ref name=TGA>{{cite web|title=PRODUCT INFORMATION NAME OF THE DRUG OZVIR TABLETS|work=TGA eBusiness Services|publisher=Ranbaxy Australia Pty Ltd|date=26 August 2011|accessdate=6 February 2014|url=https://www.ebs.tga.gov.au/ebs/picmi/picmirepository.nsf/pdf?OpenAgent&id=CP-2009-PI-00595-3|format=PDF|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820205438/https://www.ebs.tga.gov.au/ebs/picmi/picmirepository.nsf/pdf?OpenAgent&id=CP-2009-PI-00595-3|archivedate=20 August 2016|df=}}</ref><ref name=DM>{{cite web|title=Acyclovir (acyclovir)  Capsule Acyclovir (acyclovir)  Tablet [Genpharm Inc.]|work=DailyMed|publisher=Genpharm Inc.|date=November 2006|accessdate=5 February 2014|url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=12ea5042-8ea6-4ee9-a734-684a73edb373|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221224423/http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=12ea5042-8ea6-4ee9-a734-684a73edb373|archivedate=21 February 2014|df=}}</ref><ref name=EMC>{{cite web|title=Aciclovir Tablets BP 400mg - Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC)|work=electronic Medicines Compendium|publisher=Actavis UK Ltd|date=20 August 2012|accessdate=5 February 2014|url=http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/23721/SPC/Aciclovir+Tablets+BP+400mg/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222201708/http://www.medicines.org.uk/EMC/medicine/23721/SPC/Aciclovir+Tablets+BP+400mg|archivedate=22 February 2014|df=}}</ref>

===Resistance===
Resistance to aciclovir is rare in people with healthy immune systems, but is more common (up to 10%) in people with immunodeficiencies on chronic antiviral prophylaxis (transplant recipients, people with [[AIDS|acquired immunodeficiency syndrome]] due to HIV infection). Mechanisms of resistance in HSV include deficient viral thymidine kinase; and mutations to viral thymidine kinase or DNA polymerase, altering substrate sensitivity.<ref name="Martindale">{{cite book|title=Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference|chapter=Aciclovir|date=7 August 2013|publisher=Pharmaceutical Press|editor=Sweetman, S|accessdate=6 February 2014|url=http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/martindale/current/ms-1682-a.htm|location=London, UK}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Piret J, Boivin G |title=Resistance of herpes simplex viruses to nucleoside analogues: mechanisms, prevalence, and management |journal=Antimicrob.

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Acyclovir is poorly water-soluble and has poor oral [[bioavailability]] (15–30%), hence [[intravenous]] administration is necessary if high concentrations are required. When orally administered, peak plasma concentration occurs after 1–2 hours. Aciclovir has a high distribution rate; protein binding is reported to range from 9 to 33%.<ref name="emc SPC">[http://www.medicines.org.uk/EMC/medicine/23721/SPC/Aciclovir+Tablets+BP+400mg Aciclovir Tablets BP 400mg - Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) - (eMC)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222201708/http://www.medicines.org.uk/EMC/medicine/23721/SPC/Aciclovir+Tablets+BP+400mg |date=2014-02-22 }}</ref> The [[elimination half-life]] (t<sub>1/2</sub>) of aciclovir depends according to age group; neonates have a t<sub>1/2</sub> of 4 hours, children 1–12 years have a t<sub>1/2</sub> of 2–3 hours whereas adults have a t<sub>1/2</sub> of 3 hours.<ref name = MSR/>

==History==
Aciclovir was seen as the start of a new era in antiviral therapy, as it is extremely selective and low in [[cytotoxicity]].<ref name=deClercq2005/> Since discovery in mid 1970s, it is being used as an effective drug for the treatment of infections caused by most known species of the Herpes virus family including ''Herpes zoster'' & ''Varicella zoster'' viruses.  [[Nucleoside]]s isolated from a Caribbean [[sponge (animal)|sponge]], ''[[Cryptotethya crypta]]'', were the basis for the synthesis of aciclovir.<ref>{{cite book|last=Garrison|first=Tom|title=Oceanography: An Invitation to Marine Science, 3rd ed.|year=1999|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Company|location=Belmont, CA|pages=471}}</ref><ref name=bioactive>{{cite journal | last1 = Sepčić | first1 = K. | title = Bioactive Alkylpyridinium Compounds from Marine Sponges | journal = Toxin Reviews | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–160 | year = 2000 | pmid =  | pmc =  | doi = 10.1081/TXR-100100318 }}</ref><ref name=Laport2009>{{Cite journal|pmid=19149592|year=2009|author1=Laport|first1=M.

==Society and culture==

===Names===
Aciclovir is the [[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]] and  [[British Approved Name|BAN]] while acyclovir is the [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]] and former [[British Approved Name|BAN]].

It was originally marketed as Zovirax; patents expired in the 1990s and since then it is generic and is marketed under many brand names worldwide.<ref name=Names/>

===Cost===
The wholesale cost for a 400&nbsp;mg tablet in March 2016 was between US$0.03 and US$0.12 per dose.<ref name=ERC2014/><ref name=MedicaidPricing/>
