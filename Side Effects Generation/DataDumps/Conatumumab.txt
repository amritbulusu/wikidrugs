'''Conatumumab''' (originally AMG-655) is a [[monoclonal antibody]] developed for the treatment of cancer. It is a fully human monoclonal agonist antibody directed against the extracellular domain of human [[TRAIL]] (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) receptor 2 ([[Tumor necrosis factor receptor|TR]]-2, death receptor 5) with potential [[antineoplastic]] activity. Conatumumab mimics the activity of native TRAIL, binding to and activating TR-2, thereby activating [[caspase]] cascades and inducing tumor cell [[apoptosis]]. TR-2 is expressed by a variety of solid tumors and cancers of [[hematopoietic]] origin.<ref>[http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/365/conatumumab.pdf Statement On A Nonproprietary Name Adopted By The USAN Council â€“ Conatumumab], ''American Medical Association''.</ref><ref>[http://www.cancer.gov/Templates/drugdictionary.aspx?CdrID=573083 National Cancer Institute: Definition of conatumomab]</ref>

The drug was developed by [[Amgen Inc.]] In 2008, [[Takeda]] licensed the drug from Amgen for development in Japan, but discontinued development in 2011.
