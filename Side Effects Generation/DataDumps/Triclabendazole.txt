==Chemistry==
It is a member of the [[benzimidazole]] family of [[anthelmintics]]. The benzimidazole drugs share a common molecular structure, triclabendazole being the exception in having a chlorinated benzene ring but no [[carbamate]] group.  Benzimidazoles such as triclabendazole are generally accepted to bind to [[beta-tubulin]] and prevent the polymerization of the [[microtubules]] of which they are part.

==History==
Since late 1990s, triclabendazole became available as a generic drug, as patents expired in many countries. Many products were developed then. Among them, Trivantel 15,  a 15% triclabendazole suspension, was launched by [[Agrovet Market Animal Health]] in the early 2000s. In 2009, the first triclabendazole injectable solution (combined with ivermectin) was developed and launched, also by Agrovet Market Animal Health. The product, Fasiject Plus, a triclabendazole 36% and [[ivermectin]] 0.6% solution, is designed to treat infections by ''[[Fasciola hepatica]]'' (both immature and adult [[liver fluke]]s), [[roundworms]] and ectoparasites, as well.

Fasinex is a brandname for veterinary use while Egaten is a brandname for human use.
