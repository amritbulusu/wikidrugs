'''Methylone''' (also known as "'''3,4-methylenedioxy-''N''-methylcathinone'''", "'''MDMC'''", "'''βk-MDMA'''" and by the slang term "'''M1'''") is an [[empathogen-entactogen|empathogen]] and [[stimulant]] [[psychoactive drug]]. It is a member of the [[substituted amphetamine]], [[substituted cathinone]] and [[substituted methylenedioxyphenethylamine]] [[chemical classification|classes]].

Methylone is the substituted cathinone [[structural analog|analog]] of [[MDMA]] and the 3,4-[[methylenedioxy]] analog of [[methcathinone]]. The only structural difference of methylone with respect to MDMA is the substitution of 2 hydrogen atoms by 1 oxygen atom in the β position of the [[phenethylamine]] core, forming a [[ketone]] [[functional group|group]].<ref name="pmid10528135">{{cite journal |vauthors=Cozzi NV, Sievert MK, Shulgin AT, Jacob P, Ruoho AE | title = Inhibition of plasma membrane monoamine transporters by beta-ketoamphetamines | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 381 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–9 |date=September 1999 | pmid = 10528135 | doi = 10.1016/S0014-2999(99)00538-5| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0014-2999(99)00538-5}}</ref>

Methylone was first synthesized by the chemists Peyton Jacob III and [[Alexander Shulgin]] in 1996 for potential use as an antidepressant.<ref>{{Cite patent|WO|9639133}}</ref> Starting around 2004, methylone has been sold for [[recreational drug use|recreational use]], taking advantage of the absence of legal prohibition of this compound in many countries.

In spite of these behavioral and pharmacological similarities between methylone and MDMA, the observed subjective effects of both drugs are not completely identical.

== Pharmacology ==

=== Pharmacodynamics ===

Methylone acts as a mixed [[reuptake inhibitor]]/[[releasing agent]] of [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[dopamine]].<ref name="pmid10528135"/><ref name="pmid17223101">{{cite journal |vauthors=Nagai F, Nonaka R, Satoh Hisashi Kamimura K | title = The effects of non-medically used psychoactive drugs on monoamine neurotransmission in rat brain | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 559 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 132–7 |date=March 2007 | pmid = 17223101 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2006.11.075 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0014-2999(06)01381-1}}</ref> In comparison to MDMA, it has approximately 3x lower [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for the [[serotonin transporter]], while its affinity for the [[norepinephrine transporter|norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine transporter]]s is similar.<ref name="pmid10528135"/><ref name="pmid17223101"/> Notably, methylone's affinity for the [[vesicular monoamine transporter 2]] (VMAT2) is about 13x lower than that of MDMA.<ref name="pmid10528135"/> The results of these differences in pharmacology relative to MDMA are that methylone is less [[potency (pharmacology)|potent]] in terms of [[Dose (biochemistry)|dose]], has more balanced [[catecholaminergic]] effects relative to [[serotonergic]], and behaves more like a reuptake inhibitor like [[methylphenidate]] than a releaser like [[amphetamine]]; however, methylone has relatively robust releasing capabilities,<ref name="pmid17223101"/> perhaps due to its ability to [[phosphorylate]] the [[monoamine transporter]]s being similar in potency relative to MDMA.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

=== Pharmacokinetics ===

The two major [[metabolic pathway]]s in [[mammal]]s for methylone are ''N''-[[demethylation]] to [[methylenedioxycathinone]] (MDC), and [[demethylation]] followed by ''O''-[[methylation]] of the 3- or 4-[[Hydroxyl|hydroxy]] [[functional group|group]] to [[4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethcathinone]] (HMMC) or [[3-hydroxy-4-methoxymethcathinone]] (3-OH-4-MeO-MC). When 5&nbsp;mg/kg of methylone was administered to rats, it was found that around 26% was excreted as HMMC within the first 48 hours (less than 3% excreted unchanged).<ref>[http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/link.asp?id=j777t92213l50m70 Xenobioica.] HT Kamata, N Shima, K Zaitsu, T Kamata, A Miki, M Nishikawa, M Katagi, H Tsuchihashi.

== Commercial distribution ==
[[Image:Bottle with methylone aka explosion.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bottles of ''Explosion'']]

Analysis of "Explosion" has confirmed that the active ingredient is methylone.<ref>[http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/methylone/methylone_info1.shtml "Methylone sold under "Explosion" and "Inpact" brand names in the Netherlands and Japan,"] by Uil & Erowid, v1.2 - Apr 2005, www.erowid.org</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2014}} Many other formulations marketed as household chemicals, as well as the pure powder, have been sold.

== Legal status ==

===Netherlands===

In the Netherlands, methylone is not yet listed under the [[Opium Law]], but is covered under the medicine act. Because methylone is not registered officially, as such, it is forbidden to trade in methylone. The Minister of Health has asked the Coordination point Assessment and Monitoring new drugs group (CAM) to gather information about this substance, resulting possibly in an official risk assessment.<ref>van Amsterdam et al., 2004</ref> Until now, no research has been conducted on the toxicity of methylone, so nothing is known about the harmfulness of this new drug.

===New Zealand===

In New Zealand, although methylone is not explicitly scheduled and falls outside the strict definitions of an "amphetamine analogue" in the Misuse of Drugs Act, it is considered to be "substantially similar" to methcathinone and is thus considered by law enforcement authorities to be a Class C illegal drug. Methylone was sold in New Zealand for around 6 months from November 2005 to April 2006 as an MDMA substitute, under the name "Ease". The product was withdrawn after legal disputes with the government.<ref name="TVNZ_697050">{{cite news |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411424/697050 |title=Party pill sparks official concern |date=7 April 2006 |work=[[One News (New Zealand)|One News]] |accessdate=23 October 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/GE0604/S00032.htm "EASE trial terminated after conflicting advice,"] scoop.co.nz (April 9, 2006).</ref>

===UK===

In the UK, methylone is illegal since the 16/04/2010 revision of the misuse of drugs act. Before this it was not specifically mentioned in United Kingdom (U.K.) law as the β-ketone was not covered under the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971|Misuse of Drugs Act]]. In March 2010, plans were announced to make methylone and other cathinones, Class B drugs, "within weeks". While delayed by dissatisfaction in the [[Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs]], the revision was rushed through by the government with little regard for the views of the Council. The importation of the compounds was banned immediately.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8599814.stm|title=Suspected mephedrone-type compound seized at airport |date=1 April 2010|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=3 April 2010}}</ref>

===Sweden===

[[Riksdag|''Sveriges riksdag'']] added methylone to schedule I (''"substances, plant materials and fungi which normally do not have medical use"'') as narcotics in Sweden as of Oct 1, 2010,  published by [[Medical Products Agency (Sweden)|''Medical Products Agency'']] in their regulation LVFS 2010:23 listed as Metylon, 2-metylamino-1-(3,4-metylendioxifenyl)propan-1-on.<ref>http://www.lakemedelsverket.se/upload/lvfs/LVFS_2010_23.pdf</ref> Methylone was first classified by [[Riksdag|''Sveriges riksdags'']] health ministry [[:sv:Statens folkhälsoinstitut|''Statens folkhälsoinstitut'']] as "health hazard" under the act [[:sv:Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor|''Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor'']] (translated ''Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health'') as of Nov 1, 2005,  in their regulation SFS 2005:733 listed as 3,4-metylendioximetkatinon (Metylon).<ref>http://www.notisum.se/rnp/sls/sfs/20050733.pdf</ref>

===Canada===
Although not listed as a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule I controlled substances|Schedule 1]] <ref name="CDSA Schedule I: Amphetamines">[http://isomerdesign.com/Cdsa/schedule.php?schedule=1&section=18.5&structure=C]</ref> substance, Health Canada reports that methylone falls under the scheduling as an analogue of amphetamine. However, Methylone bears the exact chemical difference between amphetamine and [[cathinone]] - and cathinone is listed as not being an analogue of amphetamine, possibly implying that methylone is unscheduled in Canada.<ref name="Definitions and Interpretations">[http://isomerdesign.com/Cdsa/definitions.php?structure=C]</ref> The CDSA was updated as a result of the Safe Streets Act changing amphetamines from [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule III controlled substances|Schedule 3]] to [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule I controlled substances|Schedule 1]]; however, methylone was not added.<ref name="Safe Streets Act">[https://web.archive.org/web/20121018122345/http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/news-nouv/nr-cp/2012/doc_32759.html]</ref>

== Etymology ==

"Methylone" is also a trademarked brand name for an injectable form of [[methylprednisolone]], a corticosteroid hormone used to treat arthritis and severe allergic reactions; hence, methylone may be confused with it. Aside from context, they can be distinguished by the fact that the name will usually be capitalized when referring to the prescription drug.

A proposed alternate name is bk-MDMA, or beta-keto-MDMA. While this nomenclature has not caught on because the name "methylone" became widely used before the conflicting Methylone trademark was noticed, the analogous names for related chemicals [[bk-MDEA]] and [[bk-MBDB]] have become the established names for those substances.
