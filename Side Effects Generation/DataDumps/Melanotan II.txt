'''Melanotan II''' ('''PT-14''')<ref name=Adis>{{cite web|title=Melanotan II|url=http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800010143|publisher=AdisInsight|accessdate=6 April 2017|language=en}}</ref> is a [[peptide synthesis|synthetic]] [[analog (chemistry)|analogue]] of the [[peptide hormone]] [[α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone]] (α-MSH). 

It was under development as drug candidate for [[female sexual dysfunction]] and [[erectile dysfunction]] but clinical development ceased by 2003, and as of 2017, no product containing melanotan II was marketed and all commercial [[drug development|development]] had ceased.<ref name=Adis/> Unlicensed and untested powders sold as "melanotan II" are found on the Internet, and purported to be effective as "tanning drugs", though side effects such as uneven pigmentation, new [[nevi]] (moles) and darkening or enlargement of existing moles are common and have led to medical authorities discouraging use.<ref>Brennan R, Wells JS, Van Hout MC.

==Mechanism of action==
Melanotan II acts as a non-selective [[agonist]] of the [[melanocortin receptor]]s, [[melanocortin 1 receptor|MC<sub>1</sub>]], [[melanocortin 3 receptor|MC<sub>3</sub>]], [[melanocortin 4 receptor|MC<sub>4</sub>]], [[melanocortin 5 receptor|MC<sub>5</sub>]].<ref name="Wikberg2001">{{cite journal|last1=Wikberg|first1=Jarl ES|title=Melanocortin receptors: new opportunities in drug discovery|journal=Expert Opinion on Therapeutic Patents|volume=11|issue=1|year=2001|pages=61–76|issn=1354-3776|doi=10.1517/13543776.11.1.61}}</ref> 

To the extent that melanotan II produces [[melanogenesis]], this is thought to be caused by activation of the MC<sub>1</sub> receptor, whereas its observed sexual effects are thought to be related to its ability to activate the MC<sub>4</sub> receptor (though the MC<sub>3</sub> is thought to possibly also be involved).<ref name="NorrisLopez2010">{{cite book|author1=David O. Norris|author2=Kristin H.

Other effects of melanotan II, mostly regarded as [[adverse effect]]s, include [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[stretching]], [[yawning]], and [[anorexia (symptom)|loss of appetite]] (the last via activation of MC<sub>4</sub>).<ref name="PlantZeleznik2014">{{cite book|author1=Tony M.

==History==
Research in the early 1960s showed that in rats, administration of α-MSH caused sexual arousal, and work on this continued in many labs up through the 1980s, when scientists at University of Arizona began attempting to develop α-MSH and analogs as potential [[sunless tanning]] agents, and synthesized and tested several analogs, including [[melanotan-I]] and melanotan II.<ref name=King2007rev/><ref name=Hadley2005>{{cite journal|last1=Hadley|first1=ME|title=Discovery that a melanocortin regulates sexual functions in male and female humans.|journal=Peptides|date=October 2005|volume=26|issue=10|pages=1687-9|doi=10.1016/j.peptides.2005.01.023|pmid=15996790}}</ref>  

Very early in the process one of the scientists, who was conducting experiments on himself with an early tool compound, melanotan II, injected himself with twice the dose he intended and got an eight hour erection, along with nausea and vomiting.<ref name=King2007rev/>

To pursue the tanning agent, melanotan-I was licensed by Competitive Technologies, a [[technology transfer]] company operating on behalf of University of Arizona, to an Australian startup called Epitan,<ref>{{cite news|title=EpiTan focuses on Melanotan, a potential blockbuster|url=https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/epitan-focuses-on-melanotan-a-potential-blockbuster|work=The Pharma Letter|date=1 November 2004|language=en}}</ref><ref name=HadleyDorr2006>{{cite journal|last1=Hadley|first1=ME|last2=Dorr|first2=RT|title=Melanocortin peptide therapeutics: historical milestones, clinical studies and commercialization.|journal=Peptides|date=April 2006|volume=27|issue=4|pages=921-30|doi=10.1016/j.peptides.2005.01.029|pmid=16412534}}</ref> which changed its name to Clinuvel in 2006.<ref>{{cite news|title=Epitan changes name to Clinuvel, announces new clinical program|url=http://www.labonline.com.au/content/life-scientist/news/epitan-changes-name-to-clinuvel-announces-new-clinical-program-161764385|work=LabOnline|date=27 February 2006|language=en}}</ref>
 
To pursue the sexual dysfunction agent, melanotan-II was licensed by Competitive Technologies to Palatin Technologies.<ref name=Hadley2005/>   Palatin ceased development of melanotan-II in 2000 and synthesized, patented, and began to develop [[bremelanotide]], a likely metabolite of melanotan-II that differs from melanotan-II in that it has a hydroxyl group where melanotan-II has an amide.<ref name=King2007rev>{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = King SH, Mayorov AV, Balse-Srinivasan P, Hruby VJ, Vanderah TW, Wessells H | title = Melanocortin receptors, melanotropic peptides and penile erection | journal = Curr Top Med Chem | volume = 7 | issue = 11 | pages = 1098–1106 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17584130 | pmc = 2694735 | doi = 10.2174/1568026610707011111}}</ref><ref name=Litigation/> Competitive Technologies sued Palatin for breach of contract and to try to claim ownership of brelemanotide;<ref name=Litigation>{{cite news|title=Press Release: Palatin Technologies Refutes Competitive Technologies Contention of Material Breach|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/palatin-technologies-refutes-competitive-technologies-contention-of-material-breach-58006787.html|work=Palatin Technologies via PR Newswire|date=September 12, 2007|language=en}}</ref> the parties settled in 2008 with Palatin retaining rights to brelemanotide, returning rights to melanotan-II to Competitive Technologies, and paying $800,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Press Release: Palatin Technologies Announces Litigation Settlement With Competitive Technologies|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/palatin-technologies-announces-litigation-settlement-with-competitive-technologies-57107302.html|work=Palatin Technologies via PR Newswire|date=January 22, 2008|language=en}}</ref>
