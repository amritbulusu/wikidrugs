'''Eprosartan''' is an [[angiotensin II receptor antagonist]] used for the treatment of [[hypertension|high blood pressure]]. It is marketed in the [[United States]] as ''Teveten'' by [[Abbvie]], the [[Corporate spin-off|spin-off]] of the pharmaceutical discovery division of [[Abbott Laboratories]]; it is marketed as ''Eprozar'' by [[INTAS Pharmaceuticals]] in [[India]], and by [[Abbott Laboratories]] elsewhere. The compound came into the [[Abbott Laboratories]] cardiovascular pipeline with its acquisition of [[Kos Pharmaceuticals]] in 2006, which had licensed it, along with "a range of hypertensive treatments", from the [[Biovail Corporation]].<ref>Anon., 2006, Abbott Laboratories: Kos Pharmaceuticals a wise buy, Datamonitor ResearchStore (online), November 8, 2006, see [http://www.datamonitor.com/store/News/abbott_laboratories_kos_pharmaceuticals_a_wise_buy?productid=0BE8B1AB-14F9-4B92-99D2-80E8DC7ECA16], accessed 29 January 2015.</ref>

Eprosartan is sometimes paired with [[hydrochlorothiazide]], whereupon it is marketed in the US as '''Teveten''' '''HCT''' and elsewhere as '''Teveten''' '''Plus'''.'''

The drug acts on the [[renin-angiotensin system]] to decrease [[total peripheral resistance]] in two ways. First, it blocks the binding of [[angiotensin II]] to AT<sub>1</sub> receptors in vascular [[smooth muscle]], causing vascular dilatation. Second, it inhibits [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] [[norepinephrine]] production, further reducing blood pressure.

As with other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, eprosartan is generally better tolerated than [[enalapril]] (an [[ACE inhibitor]]), especially among the elderly.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ruilope L, Jäger B, Prichard B |title=Eprosartan versus enalapril in elderly patients with hypertension: a double-blind, randomized trial |journal=Blood Press. |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=223–9 |year=2001 |pmid=11800061 |doi=10.1080/08037050152669747}}</ref>
