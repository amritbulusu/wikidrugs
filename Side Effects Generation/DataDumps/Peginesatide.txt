'''Peginesatide'''<ref name="Affymax" /> ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]/[[United States Adopted Name|USAN]], trade name '''Omontys''', formerly '''Hematide'''), developed by [[Affymax]] and [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company|Takeda]], is an [[Erythropoiesis|erythropoietic]] agent, a [[Functional analog (chemistry)|functional analog]] of [[erythropoietin]].

It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of [[anemia]] associated with [[chronic kidney disease]] (CKD) in adult patients on [[dialysis]].<ref name=omontyssitehp/><ref name=FDAapproval/> On February 23, 2013, Affymax and Takeda issued a press release indicating that they were recalling all batches of peginesatide from the market.<ref>FDA alerts health care providers of recall of anemia drug Omontys.

==Medical uses==
The FDA approved the use of peginesatide for the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease in adult patients on dialysis.

==Chemistry and mechanism of action==
Peginesatide is a synthetic peptide, attached to [[polyethylene glycol]] ("[[PEGylated]]").<ref name="Stead" /> It mimics the structure of erythropoietin, the human glycoprotein which promotes red blood cell development.

==Related drugs==
The erythropoietin analogs currently used to treat anemia in the United States are [[epoetin alfa]] (sold under the names Procrit and Epogen) and [[darbepoetin alfa]] (which is a more glycosylated form of epoetin, sold under the name Aranesp).  There are similar biologic agents, such as [[Mircera]] (a monoPEGylated erythropoietin-beta), sold by [[Hoffmann–La Roche|Roche]] in Europe, [[Chugai]] in Japan, and VFMCRP in the United States.
