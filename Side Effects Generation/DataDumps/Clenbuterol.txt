'''Clenbuterol''', marketed as '''Dilaterol''', '''Spiropent''', '''Ventipulmin''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/animalveterinary/products/approvedanimaldrugproducts/foiadrugsummaries/ucm054881.htm|title=FOIA Drug Summaries - NADA 140-973 VENTIPULMIN® SYRUP - original approval|last=Medicine|first=Center for Veterinary|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-03-10}}</ref> is a [[sympathomimetic]] [[amine]] used by sufferers of breathing disorders as a [[decongestant]] and [[bronchodilator]]. People with chronic breathing disorders such as [[asthma]] use this as a bronchodilator to make breathing easier. It is most commonly available as the [[hydrochloride]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]], clenbuterol hydrochloride.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/jecfa/jecmono/v38je02.htm|title=874. Clenbuterol (WHO Food Additives Series 38)|website=www.inchem.org|access-date=2016-03-10}}</ref>

==Effects and dosage==
Clenbuterol is a [[Beta2-adrenergic agonist|β<sub>2</sub> agonist]] with some structural and pharmacological similarities to [[epinephrine]] and [[salbutamol]], but its effects are more potent and longer-lasting as a stimulant and [[thermogenic]] drug.{{cn|date=August 2017}} It causes an increase in [[Aerobic exercise|aerobic]] capacity, [[central nervous system]] stimulation, [[blood pressure]], and [[oxygen]] transportation. It increases the rate at which body fat is metabolized while increasing the body's [[basal metabolic rate]] (BMR).{{cn|date=August 2017}} It is commonly used for [[smooth muscle]]-relaxant properties as a bronchodilator and [[tocolytic]].

Clenbuterol is also prescribed for treatment of [[horse]]s, but equine use is usually the liquid form.

==Human use==
Clenbuterol is approved for use in some countries, free or via prescription, as a bronchodilator for asthma patients.<ref name="a">{{Cite web|title=Clenbuterol |url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drugs_concern/clenbuterol.htm |work=Daily Mail |date=2009-10-01 |accessdate=2010-04-07|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

===Weight-loss drug===
Although often used by [[bodybuilder]]s during their "cutting" cycles,{{cn|date=June 2016}} the drug has been more recently known to the mainstream, particularly through publicized stories of use by celebrities such as [[Victoria Beckham]],<ref name="independent"/> [[Britney Spears]], and [[Lindsay Lohan]],

===Side effects and dangers===
Clenbuterol can cause these side effects:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.steroidabuse.com/Profiles/clenbuterol-clen.html|title=Clenbuterol - SteroidAbuse .com|website=www.steroidabuse.com|access-date=2016-03-10}}</ref>
* Nervousness
* [[Thyrotoxicosis]]
* [[Tachycardia]]
* Subaortic [[stenosis]]
* [[High blood pressure]]

===Overdosage===
Excessive use over the recommended dose of about 120 ''μ''g can cause muscle tremors, headache, dizziness, and gastric irritation. Persons self-administering the drug for weight loss or to improve athletic performance have experienced nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, palpitations, tachycardia, and myocardial infarction.   Use of the drug may be confirmed by detecting its presence in semen or urine.<ref>R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 325–326.</ref>

===Food contamination===
Clenbuterol is occasionally referred to as "[[bute (disambiguation)#Drugs|bute]]" and this risks confusion with [[phenylbutazone]], also called "bute". Phenylbutazone, which is a drug also used with horses, was tested for in the [[2013 European meat adulteration scandal]].<ref name=fsa>{{cite web|title=Horse meat investigation. Advice for consumers|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/enforcement/monitoring/horse-meat/horse-meat-consumer-advice/|work=Enforcement and regulation|publisher=[[Food Standards Agency]]|accessdate=19 May 2013}}</ref>

Intended to result in leaner meat with a higher muscle-to-fat ratio, the use of clenbuterol has been banned in meat since 1991 in the USA and since 1996 in the European Union. The drug is banned due to health concerns about symptoms noted in consumers. These include increased heart rate, muscular tremors, headaches, nausea, fever, and chills. In several cases in Europe, these adverse symptoms have been temporary.<ref name="FSIS1995">[http://www.fsis.usda.gov/oa/background/clenbute.htm "Clenbuterol"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829112146/http://www.fsis.usda.gov/oa/background/clenbute.htm |date=2012-08-29 }}, [[Food Safety and Inspection Service]] (FSIS), July 1995, Retrieved 8 April 2015</ref>

Clenbuterol is a growth-promoting drug in the [[Beta-adrenergic agonist|β agonist]] class of compounds. It is not licensed for use in China<ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-09/30/c_131169759.htm China bans production, sale of clenbuterol to improve food safety] Retrieved 08/22/2012</ref> or the United States<ref name="FSIS1995" /> or the EU<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/animalnutrition/contaminants/index_en.htm European Commission] Retrieved 08/22/2012</ref> for food producing animals, but some countries have approved it for animals not used for food, and a few countries have approved it for therapeutic uses in food-producing animals.

Not just athletes are affected by contamination. In Portugal, 50 people were reported as affected by clenbuterol in liver and pork between 1998 and 2002, while in 1990, veal liver was suspected of causing clenbuterol poisoning in 22 people in France and 135 people in Spain.<ref>[http://www.antidoping.hk/index.php/lang-en/precautions/advisory-notes/1530-the-clenbuterol-fear Anti Doping Advisory Notes] Retrieved 08/22/2012</ref>

In February 2009, at least 70 people in one [[Chinese province]] ([[Guangdong]]) suffered food poisoning after eating pig organs believed to contain clenbuterol residue.  The victims complained of stomachaches and diarrhea after eating pig organs bought in local markets.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/02/22/china.poisonings/index.html | work=CNN | title=China: 70 ill from tainted pig organs| date=2009-02-23 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2009-02/23/content_7501017.htm | title = 70 ill after eating tainted pig organs | author = Wang Ying | publisher = China Daily | date = 2009-02-23}}</ref>

In March 2011, [[China's Ministry of Agriculture]] said the government would launch a one-year crackdown on illegal additives in pig feed, after a subsidiary of [[Shuanghui Group]], China's largest meat producer, was exposed for using clenbuterol-contaminated pork in its meat products.

Authorities around the world appear to be issuing stricter food safety requirements, such as the [[Food Safety Modernization Act]] in the United States, Canada’s revision of their import regulations, China’s new food laws published since 2009, South Africa's new food law, and many more global changes and restrictions.

==Veterinary use==
The US and the [[European Union|EU]] prohibit the use of clenbuterol in food-producing animals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_210.html|title=Import Alert 68-03|website=www.accessdata.fda.gov|access-date=2016-03-10}}</ref> It is, however, for the treatment of [[Recurrent airway obstruction|allergic respiratory disease]] in horses, as it is a [[bronchodilator]].
