'''Desmoteplase''' is a novel, highly [[fibrin]]-specific "clot-busting" ([[Thrombolysis|thrombolytic]]) [[drug development|drug in development]] that reached [[Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_III|phase III clinical trials]].  The [[Denmark|Danish]] pharmaceutical company, [[Lundbeck]], owns the worldwide rights to desmoteplase. In 2009, two large trials (DIAS-3 and DIAS-4) were started to test it as a safe and effective treatment for patients with acute [[ischaemic]] [[stroke]]. After disappointing results in DIAS-3, DIAS-4 was terminated, and in December 2014 Lundbeck announced that they would stop the development of desmoteplase.<ref name=LundbeckDiscont>{{Cite news | author = [[H Lundbeck A/S]] | title = BRIEF-Lundbeck discontinues development of desmoteplase and narrows 2014 profit guidance | publisher = Reuters | date = 2014-12-18 | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/18/hlundbeck-brief-idUSL6N0U209U20141218}}</ref>

==Mode of action==
Desmoteplase, a [[chemical]] found in the [[saliva]] of [[vampire bat]]s, has the effect of catalysing the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, which is the enzyme responsible for breaking down fibrin blood clots.

==Discovery of desmoteplase==
As early as in 1932, the [[saliva]] of the [[vampire bat]] (''Desmodus rotundus'') was known to lead to interference with the [[haemostatic]] mechanism of the host animal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hawkey C. Inhibitor of platelet aggregation present in saliva of the vampire bat Desmodus rotundus. Br J Haematol.1967;13(6):1014-20.}}</ref> In 1991, the DNA coding of four [[plasminogen]] activators present in the saliva of the [[vampire bat]] was completed. Of the four, recombinant ''D. rotundus'' salivary plasminogen activator alpha 1 (rDSPAα1; desmoteplase) was investigated further.<ref>{{cite web|title=Schleuning WD. Vampire Bat plasminogen activator DSPA-alpha-1 (desmoteplase): a thrombolytic drug optimized by natural selection. Haemostasis. 2001;31(3-6):118-122.}}</ref>

==Chemical structure==
The structure of desmoteplase is similar to rt-PA ([[alteplase]]), but it does not contain the plasmin-sensitive cleavage site and the lysine-binding Kringle 2 domain. As a result, desmoteplase, in comparison to rt-PA, has high fibrin selectivity (100,000- v. 550-fold increase in catalytic activity), an absence of [[neurotoxicity]], and no apparent negative effect on the blood–brain barrier. Desmoteplase also has a [[drug half-life|half-life]] of about four hours;<ref>{{cite web|title=Medcalf RL. Desmoteplase: discovery, insights and opportunities for ischaemic stroke. Br J Pharmacol. 2012;165:75-89.}}</ref> rtPA has a terminal plasma half-life of about 5 minutes.

==Desmoteplase in acute ischaemic stroke clinical trial program==
The two phase II trials DIAS and DEDAS indicated that when [[intravenous]] (IV) desmoteplase was administered three to 9 hours after onset of ischaemic [[stroke symptoms]], it was associated with a high rate of [[Reperfusion therapy|reperfusion]] and a low rate of symptomatic [[intracranial]] [[haemorrhage]] at doses up to 125&nbsp;µg/kg.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hacke W, Albers G, Al Rawi Y, et al.

Dose Escalation of Desmoteplase for Acute Ischemic Stroke (DEDAS): evidence of safety and efficacy 3 to 9 hours after stroke onset. Stroke. 2006;37(5):1227-1231.}}</ref> In the subsequent DIAS-2 trial, the same benefit could not be shown. This could be explained by the inclusion of a substantial number of patients with a mild stroke at baseline and small mismatch volumes associated with no [[vessel occlusion]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Hacke W, Furlan AJ, Al Rawi Y, et al. Intravenous desmoteplase in patients with acute ischaemic stroke selected by MRI perfusion-diffusion weighted imaging or perfusion CT (DIAS-2): a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Lancet Neurol. 2009;8(2):141-150.}}</ref> Post hoc analyses of the DIAS-2 data and the pooled data of the DIAS, DEDAS and DIAS-2 data showed that patients who had a proximal cerebral vessel occlusion or high-grade [[stenosis]] on baseline [[angiography]], had a positive response for desmoteplase.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fiebach JB, Al-Rawi Y, Wintermark M et al. Vascular occlusion enables selecting acute ischemic stroke patients for treatment with desmoteplase. Stroke. 2012; Jun;43(6):1561-6.}}</ref>

In 2009, the DIAS-3 and DIAS-4 phase III trials started, each planning to enroll 400 patients worldwide who had had an acute ischaemic stroke. Participants are treated with desmoteplase as an intravenous [[bolus (medicine)|bolus]] dose of 90&nbsp;µg/kg within three to 9 hours after stroke symptom onset. Patients are selected with occlusion or high-grade stenosis (TIMI 0-1) in proximal cerebral [[arteries]] as assessed by magnetic resonance or computed [[tomography]] [[angiography]]. Wherever possible, additional perfusion-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging assessments will be done.

The outcomes of DIAS-3 and DIAS-4 studies should tell whether desmoteplase is a breakthrough treatment for acute ischaemic stroke. In June 2014, Lundbeck published a press release about the DIAS-3 study revealing neutral results in an intention-to-treat analysis.<ref>http://investor.lundbeck.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=856865</ref> The proportion of patients presenting good clinical outcome was comparable in the desmoteplase group (51.3%) and in the placebo group (49.8%). Notably, Lundbeck mentioned that, when analysing per protocol, desmoteplase showed an effect relative to placebo. Publication of the final results is still awaited.

After the disappointing results in DIAS-3, the DIAS-4 trial was terminated.<ref>{{Cite web | title = Efficacy and Safety Study of Desmoteplase to Treat Acute Ischemic Stroke (DIAS-4) | publisher = [[U.S. National Institutes of Health]] | url = https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00856661}}</ref>
In December 2014 Lundbeck announced they would stop the development of desmoteplase and the company made a [[write-down]] of 309 million Danish crowns.<ref name=LundbeckDiscont/>

==Significance of the time window==

Current standards of treatment allow for IV rt-PA up to 4.5 hours in ischaemic stroke. After this time window, the benefit is typically thought to be outweighed by the risk of [[brain haemorrhage]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lees KR,  et al. Time to treatment with intravenous alteplase and outcome in stroke: an updated pooled analysis of ECASS, ATLANTIS, NINDS, and EPITHET trials. Lancet. 2010;375:1695-703.}}</ref>   Interarterial approaches are thought to be useful up to six hours. Nevertheless, CT-perfusion scans and [[MRI]]-perfusion versus MRI-diffusion demonstrate that even after six hours a significant ischaemic [[penumbra (medicine)|penumbra]] of brain tissue may be salvageable. Some approaches to this involves mechanical removal of clot (for example the [[MERCI Retriever|Merci]] device, the penumbra device and removable [[stent]]s like Solitaire).<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 23626646| pmc = 3633196| year = 2013| author1 = Jeong| first1 = H.

If desmoteplase can extend the IV treatment window to 9 hours, this would allow a much larger percentage of ischaemic stroke patients to receive active thrombolytic treatment&nbsp;– including patients who were delayed in getting to the hospital and neurological assessment. This could make a substantial difference in stroke outcomes.
A 9-hour treatment window could also have a major impact on the treatment of "wake-up" strokes -
where a patient awoke with symptoms, and is not sure whether the stroke occurred within the
past 4.5 hours.
