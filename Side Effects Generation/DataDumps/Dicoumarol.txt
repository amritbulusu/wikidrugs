'''Dicoumarol''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) or '''dicumarol''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]) is a naturally occurring [[anticoagulant]] that functions as a functional [[vitamin K]] depleter (similar to [[warfarin]], a drug that dicoumarol inspired). It is also used in biochemical experiments as an inhibitor of reductases.

Dicoumarol is a natural chemical substance of combined plant and fungal origin. It is a derivative of [[coumarin]], a bitter-tasting but sweet-smelling substance made by plants that does not itself affect coagulation, but which is (classically) transformed in mouldy feeds or silages by a number of species of fungi, into active dicoumarol. Dicoumarol does affect coagulation, and was discovered in mouldy wet sweet-clover hay, as the cause of a naturally occurring bleeding disease in cattle.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Nicole Kresge |author2=Robert D. Simoni |author3=Robert L. Hill |url=http://www.jbc.org/content/280/8/e5.full |title=Sweet clover disease and warfarin review |publisher=Jbc.org |date=2005-02-25 |accessdate=2012-09-26}}</ref> See [[warfarin]] for a more detailed discovery history.

Identified in 1940, dicoumarol became the prototype of the [[4-Hydroxycoumarins|4-hydroxycoumarin anticoagulant drug class]]. Dicoumarol itself, for a short time, was employed as a medicinal anticoagulant drug, but since the mid-1950s has been replaced by its simpler derivative [[warfarin]], and other 4-hydroxycoumarin drugs.

It is given orally, and it acts within two days.

== Uses ==
Dicoumarol was used, along with [[heparin]], for the treatment of deep venous thrombosis. Unlike heparin, this class of drugs may be used for months or years.

== Mechanism of action ==
Like all 4-hydroxycoumarin drugs it is a [[competitive inhibitor]] of [[vitamin K epoxide reductase]], an enzyme that recycles [[vitamin K]], thus causing depletion of active vitamin K in blood. This prevents the formation of the active form of [[prothrombin]] and several other coagulant enzymes. These compounds are not antagonists of Vitamin K directly—as they are in pharmaceutical uses—but rather promote depletion of vitamin K in bodily tissues allowing vitamin K's mechanism of action as a potent medication for dicoumarol toxicity. The mechanism of action of Vitamin K along with the toxicity of dicoumarol are measured with the [[prothrombin time]] (PT) blood test.

== Poisoning ==
[[Overdose]] results in serious, sometimes fatal uncontrolled [[hemorrhage]].<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1001/jama.1949.02900290008003| pmid = 18112552| title = Fatal Hemorrhage in Dicumarol® Poisoning| journal = Journal of the American Medical Association| volume = 139| issue = 12| pages = 762–6| year = 1949| last1 = Duff | first1 = I. F. | last2 = Shull| first2 = W. H.}}</ref>

==History==
Dicoumarol was isolated by [[Karl Paul Link|Karl Link]]'s laboratory at University of Wisconsin, six years after a farmer had brought a dead cow and a milk can full of uncoagulated blood to an [[agricultural extension]] station of the university.   The cow had died of internal bleeding after eating moldy sweet clover; an outbreak of such deaths had begun in the 1920s during [[The Great Depression]] as farmers could not afford to waste hay that had gone bad.<ref name=Wardrop>Wardrop D, Keeling D.
