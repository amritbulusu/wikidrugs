== Medical uses ==
Pilocarpine stimulates the secretion of large amounts of [[saliva]] and [[sweat]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Pilocarpine |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a608039.html}}</ref> It is used to treat dry mouth ([[xerostomia]]), particularly in [[Sjögren's syndrome]], but also as a side effect of [[radiation therapy]] for [[head and neck cancer]].

It has also been used in the treatment of chronic open-angle [[glaucoma]] and acute angle-closure glaucoma for over 100 years.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rosin|first=A.|title=Pilocarpine. A miotic of choice in the treatment of glaucoma has passed 110 years of use|journal=Oftalmologia|location=Romania|volume=35|issue=1|pages=53–55|pmid=1811739|year=1991}}</ref> It acts on a subtype of muscarinic receptor (M<sub>3</sub>) found on the [[iris sphincter muscle]], causing the muscle to contract -resulting in pupil constriction ([[miosis]]). Pilocarpine also acts on the [[ciliary muscle]] and causes it to contract.  When the ciliary muscle contracts, it opens the [[trabecular meshwork]] through increased tension on the [[scleral spur]]. This action facilitates the rate that [[aqueous humor]] leaves the [[human eye|eye]] to decrease [[intraocular pressure]].

In ophthalmology, pilocarpine is also used to reduce the possibility of glare at night from lights when the patient has undergone implantation of [[phakic intraocular lens]]es; the use of pilocarpine would reduce the size of the pupils, relieving these symptoms. The most common concentration for this use is pilocarpine 1%, the weakest concentration. Pilocarpine is shown to be just as effective as [[apraclonidine]] in preventing intraocular pressure spikes after [[trabeculoplasty|laser trabeculoplasty]].<ref name="Zhang">{{cite journal | author=Zhang L, Weizer JS, Musch DC | title= Perioperative medications for preventing temporarily increased intraocular pressure after laser trabeculoplasty | journal= Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume= 2| issue= 2 | pages= CD010746 | date= 2017 | pmid= 28231380 | pmc= 5477062 | doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD010746.pub2}}</ref>

Pilocarpine is used to stimulate sweat glands in a [[sweat test]] to measure the [[concentration]] of [[chloride]] and [[sodium]] that is excreted in sweat. It is used to diagnose [[cystic fibrosis]].

== Adverse effects ==
Use of pilocarpine may result in a range of adverse effects, most of them related to its [[non-selective]] action as a muscarinic receptor agonist. Pilocarpine has been known to cause excessive salivation, sweating, bronchial [[mucus]] secretion, [[bronchospasm]], [[bradycardia]], [[vasodilation]], and [[diarrhea]]. Eye drops can result in brow [[pain|ache]] and chronic use in [[miosis]].

Systemic injection of pilocarpine can compromise the [[blood brain barrier]] allowing pilocarpine to gain access to the brain which can lead to chronic epilepsy. Epilepsy induced by injected pilocarpine has been used to develop animal models in rodents in order to study human epilepsy.

==Society and culture==
=== Preparation ===
Plants in the genus ''[[Pilocarpus]]'' are the only known sources of pilocarpine, and commercial production is derived entirely from the leaves of ''[[Pilocarpus microphyllus]]'' (Maranham Jaborandi). This genus grows only in South America, and Pilocarpus microphyllus is native to several states in northern Brazil.<ref name="ivcdb">{{cite journal|title=Production of Pilocarpine in Callus of Jaborandi (''Pilocarpus microphyllus'' Stapf)|jstor=4293939|first1=Ilka Nacif|last1=De Abreu|first2=Alexandra Cristine H. F.|last2=Sawaya|first3=Marcos Nogueira|last3=Eberlin|first4=Paulo|last4=Mazzafera|journal=In Vitro Cellular & Developmental Biology. Plant|volume=41|issue=6|date=November–December 2005|pages=806–811|publisher=[[Society for In Vitro Biology]]}}</ref>

Pilocarpine is extracted from the powdered leaf material in a multi-step process. First the material is treated with [[ethanol]] acidified with [[hydrochloric acid]], and the solvents removed under reduced pressure. The resultant aqueous residue is neutralized with [[ammonia]] and put aside until the resin has completely settled. It is then filtered and concentrated by sugar solution to a small volume, made alkaline with ammonia, and finally extracted with [[chloroform]]. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure.{{Verify source|date=March 2013}}

=== Trade names ===

Pilocarpine is available under several trade names such as: Diocarpine (Dioptic), Isopto Carpine ([[Alcon]]), Miocarpine (CIBA Vision), Ocusert Pilo-20 and -40 (Alza), Pilopine HS (Alcon), Salagen (MGI Pharma), Scheinpharm Pilocarpine (Schein Pharmaceutical), and Timpilo (Merck Frosst).

== Research ==

Pilocarpine is used to induce chronic [[epilepsy]] in [[rodent]]s, commonly [[rat]]s, as a means to study the disorder's physiology and to examine different treatments.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morimoto|first=K|author2=Fahnestock, M |author3=Racine, RJ |title=Kindling and status epilepticus models of epilepsy: rewiring the brain.|journal=Progress in neurobiology|date=May 2004|volume=73|issue=1|pages=1–60|pmid=15193778|doi=10.1016/j.pneurobio.2004.03.009}}</ref>  Smaller doses may be used to induce salivation in order to collect samples of [[saliva]], for instance, to obtain information about [[IgA]] antibodies.

== Veterinary ==

Pilocarpine is given in moderate doses (about 2&nbsp;mg) to induce emesis in cats that have ingested foreign plants, foods, or drugs. One feline trial determined it was effective, even though the usual choice of [[emetic]] is [[xylazine]].
