{{Distinguish2 | [[Thyroxine-binding globulin]], a [[carrier protein]] responsible for carrying the thyroid hormones in the blood}}
{{Infobox_gene}}

'''Thyroglobulin''' ('''Tg''') is a 660 [[kDa]], [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimeric]] [[protein]] produced by the [[Follicular cell|follicular cells]] of the [[thyroid]] and used entirely within the thyroid gland. Thyroglobulin protein accounts for approximately half of the protein content of the thyroid gland.<ref name="Boron">{{cite book | author = Boron  WF | title = Medical Physiology: A Cellular And Molecular Approach | publisher = Elsevier/Saunders | location = | year = 2003 | page = 1044 | isbn = 1-4160-2328-3 }}</ref> Human TG (HTG) is a homodimer of subunits each containing 2768 amino acids as synthesized (a short signal peptide may be removed from the N-terminus in the mature protein).<ref>((cite web |url="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/NP_003226.4"))</ref>

The protein is a precursor of the [[Thyroid hormone|thyroid hormones]]; these are produced when thyroglobulin's [[tyrosine]] residues are combined with [[iodine]] and the protein is subsequently cleaved. Each thyroglobulin molecule contains approximately 100-120 tyrosine residues, but only a small number (20) of these are subject to iodination by [[thyroperoxidase]] in the follicular [[colloid]]. Therefore, each Tg molecule forms only approximately 10 thyroid hormone molecules.<ref name="Boron"/>

{{Cleanup-rewrite|the content on the iodination, coupling, and proteolytic release of T3 and T4 are incomplete/inaccurate as presented|section|date=April 2016}}
[[File:Thyroid hormone synthesis.png|thumb|left|[[Thyroid hormone synthesis]], this image traces thyroglobulin from production within the [[rough endoplasmic reticulum]] until proteolytic release of the thyroid hormones.]]
Tg is used by the thyroid gland to produce the [[thyroid hormone]]s [[thyroxine]] (T4) and  [[triiodothyronine]] (T3).  The active form of triiodothyronine, 3, 5, 3' triiodothyronine, is produced both within the thyroid gland and in the periphery by 5'-deiodinase (which has been referred to as [[tetraiodothyronine 5' deiodinase]]). It is presumed that Tg and thyroid are also an important storage of iodine for all body needs, in particular, for many iodine-concentrating organs such as breast, stomach, salivary glands, thymus, choroid plexus and cerebrospinal fluid, etc. (see [[iodine in biology]]).<ref name="pmid11014322">{{cite journal | vauthors = Venturi S, Donati FM, Venturi A, Venturi M | title = Environmental iodine deficiency: A challenge to the evolution of terrestrial life? | journal = Thyroid | volume = 10 | issue = 8 | pages = 727–9 | date = August 2000 | pmid = 11014322 | doi = 10.1089/10507250050137851 }}</ref>{{better source|date=April 2016}}

Tg is produced by the thyroid epithelial cells, called [[thyrocyte]]s, which form spherical follicles. Tg is secreted and stored in the follicular lumen.

Via a reaction with the [[enzyme]] [[thyroperoxidase]], iodine is covalently bound to [[tyrosine]] residues in thyroglobulin molecules, forming [[monoiodotyrosine]] (MIT) and [[diiodotyrosine]] (DIT).
* [[Thyroxine]] is produced by combining two [[Moiety (chemistry)|moieties]] of DIT.
* [[Triiodothyronine]] is produced by combining one molecule of MIT and one molecule of DIT.

Small globules of the follicular colloid (Tg) are endocytosed (hormone (TSH)-mediated) and [[protease]]s in [[lysosome]]s digest iodinated thyroglobulin, releasing T3 and T4 within the thyrocyte cytoplasm. The T3 and T4 are then transported across (TSH-mediated) the basolateral thyrocyte membrane, into the bloodstream, by an unknown mechanism, while the lysosome is recycled back to the follicular lumen.

== Clinical significance ==
===Half-life and clinical elevation===
Metabolism of thyroglobulin occurs in the liver and via thyroid gland recycling of the protein. Circulating thyroglobulin has a half-life of 65 hours. Following thyroidectomy, it may take many weeks before thyroglobulin levels become undetectable. After thyroglobulin levels become undetectable (following thyroidectomy), levels can be serially monitored.{{what?|date=April 2016}}  

A subsequent elevation of the thyroglobulin level is an indication of recurrence of papillary or follicular thyroid carcinoma. Hence, thyroglobulin levels in the blood are mainly used as a [[tumor marker]]<ref name="urlACS :: Tumor Markers">{{cite web | url = http://www.cancer.org/docroot/PED/content/PED_2_3X_Tumor_Markers.asp | publisher = American Cancer Society | title = ACS :: Tumor Markers  | work = | accessdate = 2009-03-28}}</ref> for certain kinds of [[thyroid cancer]] (particularly papillary or follicular thyroid cancer).  Thyroglobulin is not produced by medullary or anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.

=== Thyroglobulin antibodies ===
In the clinical laboratory, thyroglobulin testing can be complicated by the presence of anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (ATAs), alternatively referred to as TgAb. Anti-thyroglobulin antibodies are present in 1 in 10 normal individuals, and a greater percentage of patients with thyroid carcinoma. The presence of these antibodies can result in falsely low (or rarely falsely high) levels of reported thyroglobulin, a problem that can be somewhat circumvented by concomitant testing for the presence of ATAs. The ideal strategy for a clinician's interpretation and management of patient care in the event of confounding detection of ATAs is testing to follow serial quantitative measurements (rather than a single laboratory measurement). 

ATAs are often found in patients with [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]] or [[Graves' disease]]. Their presence is of limited use in the diagnosis of these diseases, since they may also be present in healthy [[euthyroid]] individuals. ATAs are also found in patients with Hashimoto's encephalopathy, a neuroendocrine disorder related to—but not caused by—Hashimoto's thyroiditis.<ref name="pmid12601119">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferracci F, Moretto G, Candeago RM, Cimini N, Conte F, Gentile M, Papa N, Carnevale A | title = Antithyroid antibodies in the CSF: Their role in the pathogenesis of Hashimoto's encephalopathy | journal = Neurology | volume = 60 | issue = 4 | pages = 712–4 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12601119 | doi = 10.1212/01.wnl.0000048660.71390.c6 }}</ref>
