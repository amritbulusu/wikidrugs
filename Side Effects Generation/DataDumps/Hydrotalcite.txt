'''Hydrotalcite''' is a [[layered double hydroxide]] of [[Chemical formula|general formula]] 
{{chem|Mg|6|Al|2|CO|3|(OH)|16}}·{{chem|4(H|2|O}}), whose name is derived from its resemblance with [[talc]] and its high water content. The layers of the structure stack in multiple ways, to produce a 3-layer [[rhombohedral]] structure (3''R'' [[Polytype]]), or a 2-layer hexagonal structure (2''H'' polytype) formerly known as manasseite. The two polytypes are often intergrown.<ref name=Mindat/><ref name=Handbook/><ref name=Report/> The carbonate anions that lie between the structural layers are weakly bound, so hydrotalcite has anion exchange capabilities.

It was first described in 1842 for an occurrence in a serpentine - [[magnesite]] deposit in Snarum, [[Modum]], [[Buskerud]], [[Norway]].<ref name=Mindat/> It occurs as an alteration mineral in [[serpentinite]] in association with  [[serpentine group|serpentine]], [[dolomite]] and [[hematite]].<ref name=Handbook/>

== Applications ==

=== Nuclear fuel reprocessing ===
Hydrotalcite has been studied as potential [[getter]] for iodide in order to scavenge the long-lived [[Iodine-129|<sup>129</sup>I]] (T<sub>1/2</sub> = 15.7 million years) and also other [[fission product]]s such as [[selenium-79|<sup>79</sup>Se]] (T<sub>1/2</sub> = 295&nbsp;000 years) and [[Technetium-99|<sup>99</sup>Tc]], (T<sub>1/2</sub> = 211&nbsp;000 years) present in spent nuclear fuel to be disposed under oxidising conditions in [[volcanic tuff]] at the [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository]]. [[Carbonate]] easily replaces iodide in its interlayer. Another difficulty arising in the quest of an iodide getter for radioactive waste is the long-term stability of the [[sequestrant]] that must survive over [[geological time]] scales. 

=== Anion exchange ===
[[Layered double hydroxides]] are well known for their [[Ion exchange|anion exchange]] properties.

=== Medical ===

Hydrotalcite is also used as an [[antacid]].

=== Wastewater treatment ===

Treating wastewater by creating hydrotalcites produces less sludge than [[Lime (material)|lime]]. In one test, final sludge reductions reached up to 90 percent. This alters the concentration of [[magnesium]] and [[aluminum]] and raises the [[pH]] of the water. As the crystals form, they trap other waste substances including radium, rare earths, anions and transition metals. The resulting mixture can be removed via centrifuge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/wastewater-cleans-self-hydrotalicites-sludge/32521/|title=Wastewater that cleans itself results in more water, less sludge|last=Hoopes|first=Heidi|date=June 12, 2014|website=www.gizmag.com|access-date=2016-06-11}}</ref>
