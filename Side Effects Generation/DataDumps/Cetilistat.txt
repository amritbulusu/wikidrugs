'''Cetilistat''' is a drug designed to treat [[obesity]]. It acts in the same way as the older drug [[orlistat]] (Xenical) by inhibiting [[pancreatic lipase]], an [[enzyme]] that breaks down [[triglycerides]] in the [[intestine]]. Without this enzyme, triglycerides from the diet are prevented from being [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] into absorbable free [[fatty acid]]s and are excreted undigested.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yamada Y, Kato T, Ogino H, Ashina S, Kato K | title = Cetilistat (ATL-962), a novel pancreatic lipase inhibitor, ameliorates body weight gain and improves lipid profiles in rats | journal = Hormone and Metabolic Research | year = 2008 | volume = 40 | issue = 8 | pages = 539–43 | pmid = 18500680 | doi = 10.1055/s-2008-1076699}}</ref>

In human trials, cetilistat was shown to produce similar weight loss to orlistat, but also produced similar side effects such as oily, loose stools, [[fecal incontinence]], frequent bowel movements, and [[flatulence]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 16953261 | year = 2007 | last1 = Kopelman | first1 = P | last2 = Bryson | first2 = A | last3 = Hickling | first3 = R | last4 = Rissanen | first4 = A | last5 = Rossner | first5 = S | last6 = Toubro | first6 = S | last7 = Valensi | first7 = P | title = Cetilistat (ATL-962), a novel lipase inhibitor: A 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled study of weight reduction in obese patients | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 494–9 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ijo.0803446 | journal = International journal of obesity (2005)}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 18393108 | year = 2008 | last1 = Padwal | first1 = R | title = Cetilistat, a new lipase inhibitor for the treatment of obesity | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 414–21 | journal = Current opinion in investigational drugs (London, England : 2000)}}</ref> It is likely that the same precautions would apply in that absorption of [[fat soluble vitamins|fat-soluble vitamins]] and other fat-soluble nutrients may be inhibited, requiring vitamin supplements to be used to avoid deficiencies.

Cetilistat has completed Phase 1 and 2 trials in the West and is currently in Phase 3 trials in Japan where it is partnered with Takeda.<ref>http://www.alizyme.com/alizyme/products/cetilistat/  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107062029/http://www.alizyme.com/alizyme/products/cetilistat/ |date=January 7, 2009 }}</ref>  Norgina BV has now acquired the full global rights to cetilistat from Alizyme after the latter went into administration.<ref>[http://www.norgine.com/downloads/pr_archive/Norgine%20aquires%20cetilistat_2.pdf Norgine acquires cetilistat]</ref>

A published phase 2 trial found cetilistat significantly reduced weight with and was better tolerated than orlistat.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Weight loss, HbA1c reduction, and tolerability of cetilistat in a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial in obese diabetics: comparison with orlistat (Xenical).|date = Jan 2010|journal = Obesity|accessdate = |doi = 10.1038/oby.2009.155|pmid = 19461584 |volume=18 |pages=108–15}}</ref>
