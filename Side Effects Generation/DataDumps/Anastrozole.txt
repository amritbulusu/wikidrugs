==Medical uses==
[[File:Arimidex.jpg|thumb|left|Arimidex (anastrozole) 1 mg tablets]]
The ATAC trial was of localized breast cancer and women received either anastrozole, tamoxifen, or both for five years, followed by five years of follow-up.<ref name="ATAC">{{cite journal |author =Howell A |author2=Cuzick J |author3=[[Michael Baum|Baum M]] |title=Results of the ATAC (Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination) trial after completion of 5 years' adjuvant treatment for breast cancer |journal=[[The Lancet|Lancet]] |volume=365 |issue=9453 |pages=60–2 |year=2005 |pmid=15639680 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17666-6|display-authors=etal}}</ref>  After more than 5 years the group that received anastrozole had better results than the tamoxifen group.<ref name="ATAC"/> The trial suggested that anastrozole is the preferred medical therapy for postmenopausal women with localized breast cancer, which is [[estrogen receptor]] (ER) positive.<ref name="ATAC"/> Another study found that the risk of recurrence was reduced by 40%, but was associated with an increased risk of bone fractures.  The study concluded that ER positive patients benefited from switching from tamoxifen to anastrozole in patients who have completed 2 years' adjuvant tamoxifen.<ref name="Jakesz">{{cite journal |vauthors=Jakesz R, Jonat W, Gnant M, Mittlboeck M, Greil R, Tausch C, Hilfrich J, Kwasny W, Menzel C, Samonigg H, Seifert M, Gademann G, Kaufmann M, Wolfgang J | title = Switching of postmenopausal women with endocrine-responsive early breast cancer to anastrozole after 2 years' adjuvant tamoxifen: combined results of ABCSG trial 8 and ARNO 95 trial | journal = Lancet | volume = 366 | issue = 9484 | pages = 455–62 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16084253 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67059-6 | url = }}</ref> A more recent trial found that anastrozole significantly reduced the incidence of breast cancer in postmenopausal women relative to placebo, and while there were side effects related to estrogen deprivation observed, the researchers concluded that this was probably not related to the treatment. Lead author [[Jack Cuzick]] was quoted by the BBC as saying, "This class of drugs is more effective than previous drugs such as [[tamoxifen]] and crucially, it has fewer side effects," adding that he thought there was now enough evidence to support offering the drug.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-25346638 | title=Breast cancer: Drug 'halves' risk of tumours | work=[[BBC News]] | date=12 December 2013 | accessdate=12 December 2013 | author=Gallagher, James | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212170047/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-25346638 | archivedate=12 December 2013 | df= }}</ref>

==Side effects==
Bone weakness has been associated with anastrozole. Women who switched to anastrozole after two years on tamoxifen reported twice as many fractures as those who continued to take tamoxifen (2.1% compared to 1%).<ref name="Jakesz"/> [[Bisphosphonates]] are sometimes prescribed to prevent the osteoporosis induced by aromatase inhibitors. The level of circulating estradiol is likely causal here and not the anastrozole itself, and so the dose will determine likelihood of osteoporosis (estradiol inhibits [[osteoclast]]s, which resorb bone). Acne, constricted pupils and water retention have also been attributed with use of this anti-estrogen.

==Pharmacology==
Anastrozole reversibly binds to the [[aromatase]] [[enzyme]], and through [[competitive inhibition]] blocks the conversion of [[androgen]]s to [[estrogen]]s in peripheral (extragonadal) [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]].<ref name="pmid14623515">{{cite journal | author = Simpson ER | title = Sources of estrogen and their importance | journal = J.

==Pharmacodynamics==
