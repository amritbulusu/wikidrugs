It is bound to albumins in 90%, and around 10% is in a free form. It binds neither to SHBG, nor CBG. Its metabolites are inactive and rapidly excreted. The half-life is 10 hours. Stable concentrations are achieved after two days of treatment. Dienogest does not accumulate in the body. It demonstrates a poor affinity to the PR, but has a very potent progestagenic effect in the endometrium, and causes endometrial atrophy after prolonged use. It shows antagonist activity by binding to the AR, and hence produces an antiandrogenic action equivalent to ca. 40% of the effect induced by cyproterone acetate. Dienogest does not interact with the GR, MR or ER. [...] In vivo, it has a powerful progestagenic and moderate antigonadotropic activity, without any androgenic, glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid effects. A dose of 2 mg inhibits the growth of ovarian follicles at 10 mm and maintains the concentration of progesterone at a low level, but has a weak inhibitory effect on FSH and LH. Consequently, dienogest is believed to have a weak central antigonadotropic action, but a potent direct peripheral ovulation-inhibiting effect [8].

==Interactions==
