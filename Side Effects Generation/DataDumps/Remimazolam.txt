'''Remimazolam'''<ref>EP Patent 1183243</ref> ('''CNS-7056''') is a benzodiazepine derivative drug, developed by PAION, in collaboration with Japanese licensee Ono Pharmaceutical as an alternative to the short-acting imidazobenzodiazepine [[midazolam]], for use in induction of anaesthesia and conscious sedation for minor invasive procedures. Remimazolam was found to be both faster acting and shorter lasting than midazolam, and human [[clinical trial]]s showed a faster recovery time and predictable, consistent pharmacokinetics, suggesting some advantages over existing drugs for these applications.<ref name="pmid21154153">{{cite journal |vauthors=Rogers WK, McDowell TS |title=Remimazolam, a short-acting GABA(A) receptor agonist for intravenous sedation and/or anesthesia in day-case surgical and non-surgical procedures |journal=IDrugs : the Investigational Drugs Journal |volume=13 |issue=12 |pages=929–37 |date=December 2010 |pmid=21154153 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid21245208">{{cite journal |vauthors=Saari TI, Uusi-Oukari M, Ahonen J, Olkkola KT |title=Enhancement of GABAergic activity: neuropharmacological effects of benzodiazepines and therapeutic use in anesthesiology |journal=Pharmacological Reviews |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages=243–67 |date=March 2011 |pmid=21245208 |doi=10.1124/pr.110.002717 |url=}}</ref>
