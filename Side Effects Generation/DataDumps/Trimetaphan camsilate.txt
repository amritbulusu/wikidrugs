'''Trimetaphan camsilate''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) or '''trimethaphan camsylate''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]), trade name '''Arfonad''', is a drug that counteracts [[cholinergic]] transmission at the [[ganglion type receptor|ganglion type]] of [[nicotinic receptor]]s of the [[autonomic ganglia]] and therefore blocks both the [[sympathetic nervous system]] and the [[parasympathetic nervous system]].  It acts as a non-depolarizing [[competitive antagonist]] at the nicotinic [[acetylcholine]] receptor, is short-acting, and is given intravenously.

==Effects==
Trimetaphan is a [[sulfonium]] compound and therefore carries a positive charge.  Being charged, it cannot cross [[lipid]] [[cell membrane]]s, such as those that comprise the [[blood–brain barrier]].  Due to this, trimethaphan does not have any effect on the [[central nervous system]].

The [[ciliary muscle]] of the [[human eye|eye]] functions to round the [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]] for [[Accommodation (eye)|accommodation]] and is controlled mainly by parasympathetic system input.  With administration of a ganglion-blocking drug, the ciliary muscle cannot contract ([[cycloplegia]]) and the patient loses the ability to focus their eyes.

Trimetaphan has a strong effect on the [[cardiovascular system]].  The size of blood vessels is primarily controlled by the sympathetic nervous system.  Loss of sympathetic system input to the [[blood vessel]]s causes them to get larger ([[vasodilation]]) which has the effect of lowering [[blood pressure]].  [[Postural hypotension]] is a common side effect of such drugs. Trimethaphan causes a histamine release which further lowers blood pressure. Effects on the [[heart]] include a decreased force of contraction and an increase in heart rate ([[tachycardia]]). Reflexive tachycardia can be diminished or undetected because trimetaphan is also blocking the sympathetic ganglia innervating the heart. 

The motility of the [[gastrointestinal tract]] is regulated by the parasympathetic system, and blockage of this input results in diminished motility and [[constipation]].

==Therapeutic uses==
The therapeutic uses of trimetaphan are very limited due to the competition from newer drugs that are more selective in their actions and effects produced.  It is occasionally used to treat a [[hypertensive crisis]] and [[dissecting aortic aneurysm]], to treat [[pulmonary edema]], and to reduce bleeding during [[neurosurgery]].
