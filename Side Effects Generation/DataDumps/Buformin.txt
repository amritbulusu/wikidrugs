'''Buformin''' (1-butylbiguanide) is an oral [[antidiabetic drug]] of the [[biguanide]] class, chemically related to [[metformin]] and [[phenformin]]. Buformin was marketed by German pharmaceutical company [[Grünenthal]] as Silubin.

==Chemistry and animal toxicology==
Buformin hydrochloride is a fine, white to slightly yellow, crystalline, odorless powder, with a weakly acidic bitter taste. Its melting point is 174 to 177&nbsp;°C, it is a strong base, and is freely soluble in water, methanol and ethanol, but insoluble in chloroform and ether.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Jacker | first1 = HJ | year = 1964 | title = New Pharmacologic Products. 2.

==Mechanism of action==
Buformin delays absorption of glucose from the gastrointestinal tract, increases insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake into cells, and inhibits synthesis of glucose by the liver. Buformin and the other biguanides are not hypoglycemic, but rather antihyperglycemic agents. They do not produce hypoglycemia; instead, they reduce basal and postprandial hyperglycemia in diabetics.<ref>Enrique Ravina, Hugo Kubinyi. The Evolution of Drug Discovery: From Traditional Medicines to Modern Drugs. Wiley. 2011 p 215</ref> Biguanides may antagonize the action of [[glucagon]], thus reducing fasting glucose levels.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = RA | last2 = Chu | first2 = Q | last3 = Xie | first3 = J | last4 = Foretz | first4 = M | last5 = Viollet | first5 = B | last6 = Birnbaum | first6 = MJ | date = Feb 2013 | title = Biguanides suppress hepatic glucagon signalling by decreasing production of cyclic AMP | journal = Nature | volume = 494 | issue = 7436| pages = 256–60 | doi = 10.1038/nature11808 | pmid = 23292513 | pmc=3573218}}</ref>

==Pharmacokinetics==
After oral administration of 50&nbsp;mg of buformin to volunteers, almost 90% of the applied quantity was recovered in the urine; the rate constant of elimination was found to be 0.38 per hr. Buformin is a strong base (pKa = 11.3) and not absorbed in the stomach. After intravenous injection of about 1&nbsp;mg/kg buformin-14-C, the initial serum concentration is 0.2-0.4&nbsp;µg/ml. Serum level and urinary elimination rate are linearly correlated.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Beckmann | first1 = R | date = Mar 1968 | title = The fate of biguanides in man | url = | journal = Ann N Y Acad Sci | volume = 148 | issue = 3| pages = 820–32 }}</ref> In man, after oral administration of 50&nbsp;mg 14-C-buformin, the maximum serum concentration was 0.26-0.41&nbsp;µg/ml. The buformin was eliminated with an average half-life of 2 h. About 84% of the dose administered was found excreted unchanged in the urine.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Beckmann | first1 = R | last2 = Lintz | first2 = W | last3 = Schmidt-Böthelt | first3 = E | date = Sep 1971 | title = Evaluation of a sustained release form of the oral antidiabetic butylbiguanide (Silubin retard) | url = | journal = Eur J Clin Pharmacol | volume = 3 | issue = 4| pages = 221–8 | doi=10.1007/bf00565010}}</ref> Buformin is not metabolized in humans.

==Dosage==
The daily dose of buformin is 150–300&nbsp;mg by mouth.<ref>Gustav Kuschinsky, Heinz Lüllmann. Textbook of pharmacology. Academic Press p 225, 1973</ref> Buformin has also been available in a sustained release preparation, Silubin Retard, which is still sold in Romania.

==Side effects and contraindications==
The side effects encountered are anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, metallic taste, and weight loss. Its use is contraindicated in
diabetic coma, ketoacidosis, severe infection, trauma, other conditions where buformin is unlikely to control the hyperglycemia, renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, recent myocardial infarct, dehydration, alcoholism, and conditions likely to predispose to lactic acidosis.

==Toxicity==
Buformin was withdrawn from the market in many countries due to an elevated risk of causing [[lactic acidosis]] (although not the US, where it was never sold). Buformin is still available and prescribed in Romania (timed release Silubin Retard is sold by [[Zentiva]]<!--, formerly SICOMED SA BUCURESTI-->), Hungary,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hankó | first1 = B | last2 = Tukarcs | first2 = E | last3 = Kumli | first3 = P | last4 = Vincze | first4 = Z | date = Jun 2005 | title = Antidiabetic drug utilization in Hungary | url = | journal = Pharm World Sci. | volume = 27 | issue = 3| pages = 263–5 | doi=10.1007/s11096-004-5804-1}}</ref><ref>Hankó BZ, Reszegi CA, Kumli P, Vincze Z.
