'''Phenyltoloxamine''' is an [[antihistamine]] with [[sedative]] and [[analgesic]] effects. It is a member of the [[ethanolamine]] class of [[antihistaminergic]] agents and an [[anticholinergic]].

==Common use==
Phenyltoloxamine is widely used in preparations as an enhancing [[Biological agent|agent]] for some analgesics and antitussives ([[acetaminophen]], [[dihydrocodeine]], [[codeine]], [[hydrocodone]]). It is widely used in certain parts of the world as [[cough suppressant]] usually with codeine, and sometimes by itself or in addition to [[dextromethorphan]] as it, like [[diphenhydramine]], possesses antitussive action of its own and is particularly useful in semi-productive coughs because of its moderate drying action. 

Phenyltoloxamine has analgesic and anti-spasmodic properties of its own{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} and is used in combination with [[paracetamol]], [[aspirin]] and other [[salicylates]] and other drugs in proprietary preparations available over the counter for backache, muscle strains and similar conditions. In this respect, it is similar to a closely related antihistamine, [[orphenadrine]], and both drugs are very closely related to [[diphenhydramine]] and to [[doxylamine]], the latter of which is the active ingredient in NyQuil and many other cough preparations.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Phenyltoloxamine is one of the more effective potentiators of codeine and derivatives such as [[ethylmorphine]], [[dihydrocodeine]],  [[oxycodone]], [[nicocodeine]], [[hydrocodone]] and similar drugs like [[tramadol]] and [[propoxyphene]] for all indications, pain relief and cough suppression in particular.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Phenyltoloxamine, like diphenhydramine and doxylamine, is an effective non-narcotic anti-tussive on its own but tends to be effective only for productive coughs as the anticholinergic action will exacerbate dry, unproductive coughs, so it is often combined with [[dextromethorphan]], [[codeine]], [[ethylmorphine]], [[dihydrocodeine]], or [[hydrocodone]] in cough suppressants both over the counter and prescription.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

It is also used to discourage [[Drug abuse|abuse]] in certain [[opiate]] analgesics due to its unpleasant side effects at high doses.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  While therapeutic doses of phenyltoloxamine can generate mild to moderate euphoria as can many of its close chemical relatives{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, much higher doses have a side effect profile similar to that of [[atropine]], which is also used in this fashion for tablets of [[diphenoxylate]] and [[morphine]] for oral administration.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

== Adverse effects ==
Common [[adverse effects]] are those associated with most anticholinergics, with effects being more pronounced in children and the elderly.

{{Seealso|anticholinergic}}

== Availability ==
Though it is rare in several [[western countries]], phenyltoloxamine is widely used on the global scale, particularly in the [[developing world]].

In the past it was not a [[controlled substance]]. It was taken off the market but is available OTC again in the US by some pharmaceutical companies.  Some preparations contain opiates such as codeine or hydrocodone and are controlled. When used in preparations with [[acetaminophen]] it is generally [[Over-the-counter drug|over the counter]].

Phenyltoloxamine combinations are sold under wide variety of preparations, brand names and dosages around the world:

* '''Aceta-Gesic''', '''Ed-Flex''', '''Dologesic''', '''Duraxin''', '''Flextra-650''', '''Novagesic''', '''Pain-gesic''', '''Phenylgesic''' - North America
* '''Codipront''' - Europe/South America
* '''Codivis''' - Israel

== See also ==
* [[Diphenhydramine]]
* [[Etoloxamine]] (ethyl groups) is a regioisomer of the anticancer drug [[Tesmilifene]].
