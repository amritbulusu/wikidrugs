'''Tums''' is an [[antacid]] made of [[sucrose]] (sugar) and [[calcium carbonate]] (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) manufactured by [[GlaxoSmithKline]] in St. Louis, Missouri, USA. They are also available in a sugar free version. It is an [[over-the-counter drug]], available at many retail stores, including drug stores, grocery stores and mass merchandisers. It provides relief from [[acid indigestion]], [[heartburn]], and [[indigestion]] ("sour stomach").
== History ==
In 1928, Jim Howe, a pharmacist in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], developed Tums in the basement of his home while treating his wife's indigestion. The remedy caught on, and commercial production began in 1930 by the Lewis-Howe Company, which took its name from Howe and his uncle, A. H. Lewis, who was a pharmacist in [[Bolivar, Missouri]]; Howe worked in his uncle's drugstore as a teenager. 

In 1978 the company was purchased by [[Revlon]] of New York, making it no longer a St. Louis-based company. Revlon's [[Norcliff Thayer]] unit oversaw the Tums brand. Revlon spun Norcliff Thayer off to [[Beecham Group]] in 1986, and Beecham eventually became GlaxoSmithKline through a series of mergers.

Since 1930, a plant originally built by Lewis-Howe in downtown St. Louis has been making the antacid tablets. The factory complex is the main manufacturing site for Tums to this day, and GlaxoSmithKline recently completed millions of dollars worth of renovations and modernizations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stltoday.com/business/tums-still-rolling-after-years/article_a2180d60-5ff8-5b87-95d6-13f37a7f044c.html |title=Tums still rolling after 80 years |author=Brown, Lisa |date=September 5, 2010 |website=www.stltoday.com |publisher= |accessdate=9 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2004/01/01/biz_tums01.html |title=Tums give 75 years of relief |author=Latzke, Jeff |date=January 1, 2004 |website=www.enquirer.com |publisher=''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'' via [[Associated Press]] |accessdate=9 November 2013}}</ref>
