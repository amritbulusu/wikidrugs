'''Nonivamide''', also called '''pelargonic acid vanillylamide''' or '''PAVA''', is an [[organic compound]] and a [[capsaicinoid]]. It is an [[amide]] of [[pelargonic acid]] (n-nonanoic acid) and [[vanillyl amine]].  It is present in [[chili pepper]]s,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Howard L. Constant, Geoffrey A. Cordell and Dennis P. West |journal = J. Nat. Prod. | date = 1996 | volume = 59 | issue = 4 | pages = 425–426 | doi = 10.1021/np9600816}}</ref> but is commonly manufactured synthetically. It is more heat-stable than [[capsaicin]]. 

Ointment sold under trade name Finalgon is used to relieve arthritis and muscle pain. A small drop of the ointment applied on the skin is absorbed quickly causing warm to burning sensation and pain relief for several hours.{{whosays|date=April 2016}}

Nonivamide is used as a [[food additive]] to add [[pungency]] to [[seasoning]]s, [[flavoring]]s, and [[spice]] blends. It is also used in the [[confectionery]] industry to create a hot sensation, and in the pharmaceutical industry in some formulations as a cheaper alternative to capsaicin. 

Like capsaicin, it can deter mammals (but not birds or insects) from consuming plants or seeds (e.g. squirrels and bird feeder seeds).<ref name=aversiontech>http://www.aversiontech.com/hot-and-spicy/nonivamide-pava/ Retrieved 16 July 2010</ref> This is consistent with nonivamide's role as a [[TRPV1]] ion channel agonist. Mammalian TRPV1 is activated by heat and capsaicin, but the avian form is insensitive to capsaicin.<ref>http://pubs.rsc.org/-/content/articlehtml/2015/fo/c4fo00435c</ref>  

Nonivamide is used (under the name PAVA) as the payload in "less-lethal munitions" such as the Fabrique Nationale Herstal FN 303<ref name=fn303>http://www.fnhusa.com/r/training/training_faq_tabs/303-launcher Retrieved 13 April 2013</ref> or as the active ingredient in most pepper sprays<ref name=aversiontech/> – in both applications, the idea is to temporarily incapacitate people so that they can either be detained prior to arrest or deterred from acts of violence toward law-enforcement personnel or third parties (such as rioting or other group violence).
