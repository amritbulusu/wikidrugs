'''Beclamide''' (marketed as '''Chloracon''', '''Hibicon''', '''Posedrine''', '''Nydrane''', '''Seclar''', and other names) is a [[pharmaceutical drug|drug]] that possesses anticonvulsant activity.<ref name="pmid8583359">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ahmadi M, Nicholls PJ, Smith HJ, Spencer PS, Preet-Ryatt MS, Spragg BP |title=Metabolism of beclamide after a single oral dose in man: quantitative studies |journal=The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology |volume=47 |issue=10 |pages=876–8 |date=October 1995 |pmid=8583359 |doi= 10.1111/j.2042-7158.1995.tb05757.x|url=}}</ref>  It is no longer used.

==Uses==
It has been used as a [[sedative]] and as an [[anticonvulsant]].

It was studied in the 1950s for its anticonvulsant properties, as a treatment for generalised tonic-clonic [[seizure]]s. It was not effective for [[absence seizure]]s.

Interest in the drug resumed in the 1990s for its psychiatric properties as an adjunct in the treatment of [[schizophrenia]].<ref name="pmid2183543">{{cite journal |vauthors=Raptis C, Garcia-Borreguero D, Weber MM, Dose M, Bremer D, Emrich HM |title=Anticonvulsants as adjuncts for the neuroleptic treatment of schizophrenic psychoses: a clinical study with beclamide |journal=Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=162–7 |date=February 1990 |pmid=2183543 |doi= 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1990.tb06472.x|url=}}</ref>

==Side effects==
Side effects are uncommon but include stomach pain, nervousness, giddiness, skin rash and [[leukopenia]]. It is counter-indicated in breast feeding as it is passed in the milk.

==Administration and pharmacology==
Administration is oral, though it has an unpleasant taste. It is quickly absorbed and elimination is renal and complete within 48 hours. Beclamide is possibly metabolized to [[3-chloropropanoic acid]] ''in vivo'',{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} which binds to the [[GHB receptor]].
