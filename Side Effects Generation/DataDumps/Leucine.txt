'''Leucine''' (abbreviated as '''Leu''' or '''L''') is an α-[[amino acid]] that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-[[amino group]] (which is in the protonated −NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> form under biological conditions), an α-[[Carboxylic acid|carboxylic acid group]] (which is in the deprotonated −COO<sup>−</sup> form under biological conditions), and a side chain [[Isobutyl|isobutyl group]], making it a [[Chemical polarity|non-polar]] [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] amino acid. It is [[Essential amino acid|essential]] in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it: it must be obtained from the diet. Human dietary sources are foods that contain protein, such as meats, dairy products, soy products, beans and legumes. In the [[genetic code]] it is encoded by the six [[codon]]s UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, and CUG.

Like [[valine]] and [[isoleucine]], leucine is a [[Branched-chain amino acid|branched-chain]] amino acid. Because the products of its breakdown are [[acetyl-CoA]] and [[acetoacetate]], it is one of the two exclusively [[Ketogenic amino acid|ketogenic amino acids]], [[lycine]] being the other one.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sSyMAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA266|title=Biochemistry|last=Ferrier|first=Denise R.|date=2013-05-24|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=9781451175622|language=en}}</ref> It is the most important ketogenic amino acid in humans.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=X3DK4nWybaMC|title=Metabolic & Therapeutic Aspects of Amino Acids in Clinical Nutrition, Second Edition|last=Cynober|first=Luc A.|date=2003-11-13|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780203010266|language=en}}</ref><sup>p.101</sup>

==Biology==
Leucine is used in the [[liver]], [[adipose tissue]], and [[muscle tissue]]. Adipose and muscle tissue use leucine in the formation of [[sterol]]s. Combined leucine use in these two tissues is seven times greater than in the liver.<ref>{{cite web | author=J. Rosenthal, et al. Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada | title=Metabolic fate of leucine: A significant sterol precursor in adipose tissue and muscle | work= American Journal of Physiology Vol. 226, No. 2, p. 411-418 | url=http://ajplegacy.physiology.org/cgi/reprint/226/2/411 | accessdate=25 March 2008}}</ref>

Leucine is rapidly taken up into the brain where astrocytes convert it to alpha-ketoisocaproate via transamination of alpha-ketoglutarate to glutamate. [reference: Yudoff, Mark. (Feb 01 2017) "Interactions in the Metabolism of Glutamate and the Branched-Chain Amino Acids and ketoacids in the CNS" Neurochem Res. 2017 January; 42(1): 10-18. doi:10.1007/s11064-016-2057-z. ]

=== Biosynthesis in plants===
Leucine is an essential amino acid in the diet of animals because they lack the complete enzyme pathway to synthesize it ''de novo'' from potential precursor compounds. Consequently, they must ingest it, usually as a component of proteins. Plants and microorganisms synthesize leucine from [[pyruvic acid]] with a series of enzymes:<ref>Nelson, D. L.; Cox, M. M. "Lehninger, Principles of Biochemistry" 3rd Ed. Worth Publishing: New York, 2000. {{ISBN|1-57259-153-6}}.</ref>
* [[Acetolactate synthase]]
* Acetohydroxy acid isomero[[reductase]]
* [[Dihydroxyacid dehydratase]]
* α-Isopropylmalate [[synthase]]
* α-Isopropylmalate [[isomerase]]
* Leucine [[aminotransferase]]
Synthesis of the small, hydrophobic amino acid [[valine]] also includes the initial part of this pathway.

== Chemical properties ==

Leucine is a [[Branched-chain amino acids|branched-chain amino acid]] (BCAA) since it possesses an [[aliphatic]] side-chain that is non-linear.

[[Racemic]] leucine had been subjected to circularly [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]] [[synchrotron radiation]] to better understand the origin of biomolecular asymmetry. An enantiomeric enhancement of 2.6% had been induced, indicating a possible photochemical origin of biomolecules' [[homochirality]].<ref>[[Uwe Meierhenrich|Meierhenrich]]: ''Amino acids and the asymmetry of life'', Springer-Verlag, 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-540-76885-2}}.</ref>

== Other uses ==
As a [[food additive]], L-leucine has [[E number]] '''E641''' and is classified as a [[flavor enhancer]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Winter|first1=Ruth|title=A consumer's dictionary of food additives|date=2009|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=New York|isbn=0307408922|edition=7th}}</ref>
