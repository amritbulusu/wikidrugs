'''Phenothiazine''', abbreviated '''PTZ''', is an [[organic compound]] that has the formula S(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NH and is related to the [[thiazine]]-class of [[heterocyclic compound]]s.  Although the parent compound has no uses, derivatives of phenothiazine are highly bioactive and have widespread use and rich history. The derivative [[chlorpromazine]] revolutionized the field of [[psychiatry]] and [[allergy]] treatment. An earlier derivative, [[methylene blue]], was one of the first [[antimalarial drugs]], and as of 2015 derivatives are under investigation as possible anti-infective drugs.  Phenothiazine is a prototypical pharmaceutical [[Pharmacophore|lead structure]] in [[medicinal chemistry]].

==Uses==
Phenothiazine itself is only of theoretical interest, but its derivatives revolutionized psychiatry, other fields of medicine, and pest management.  Other derivatives have been studied for possible use in advanced batteries and fuel cells.<ref name=DDD>{{cite journal|authors=M. J. Ohlow, , B. Moosmann|title= Phenothiazine: the seven lives of pharmacology's first lead structure|journal=Drug Discov. Today|year=2011|volume=16|pages=119-31|pmid=21237283}}</ref>

=== Phenothiazine-derived drugs ===
In 1876, [[methylene blue]], a derivative of phenothiazine, was synthesized by [[Heinrich Caro]] at [[BASF]].  The structure was deduced in 1885 by Heinrich August Bernthsen.  Bernthsen synthesized phenothiazine in 1883.<ref name=DDD/> In the mid 1880s, [[Paul Ehrlich]] began to use methylene blue in his [[Paul Ehrlich#Hematological staining|cell staining]] experiments that led to pioneering discoveries about different cell types.  He was awarded a Nobel Prize based in part on that work.  He became particularly interested in [[Paul Ehrlich#Methylene blue|its use to stain bacteria and parasites]] such as ''[[Plasmodiidae]]'' – the genus that includes the [[malaria]] pathogen – and found that it could be stained with methylene blue.  He thought methylene blue could possibly be used in the treatment of malaria, tested it clinically, and by the 1890s methylene blue  was being used for that purpose.<ref name=DDD/>

For the next several decades, research on derivatives lapsed until phenothiazine itself came to market as an insecticide and deworming drug.  In the 1940s, chemists working with Paul Charpentier at Rhone-Poulenc Laboratories in Paris (a precursor company to [[Sanofi]], began making derivatives.  This work led to [[promethazine]] which had no activity against infective organisms, but did have good [[antihistamine]] activity, with a strong sedative effect. It went to market as a drug for allergies and for [[anesthesia]]. As of 2012 it was still on the market.<ref name=DDD/>  At the end of the 1940s the same lab produced [[chlorpromazine]] which had an even stronger sedative and soothing effect, and [[Jean Delay]] and [[Pierre Deniker]] attempted to use it on their psychiatric patients, publishing their results in the early 1950s.  The strong effects they found opened the door of the modern field of psychiatry and led to a proliferation of work on phenothiazine derivatives.<ref name=DDD/>  The systematic research conducted by chemists to explore phenothiazine derivatives and their activity was a pioneering example of [[medicinal chemistry]]; phenothiazine is often discussed as a prototypical example of a pharmaceutical [[Pharmacophore|lead structure]].<ref name=DDD/><ref name=Jaszczyszyn/>

The term "phenothiazines" describes the largest of the five main classes of [[antipsychotic|antipsychotic drugs]]. These drugs have antipsychotic and, often, [[antiemetic]] properties, although they may also cause severe [[Adverse drug reaction|side effects]] such as [[extrapyramidal symptoms]] (including [[akathisia]] and [[tardive dyskinesia]]), [[hyperprolactinaemia]], and the rare but potentially fatal [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]], as well as substantial weight gain.<ref name=DDD/>   Use of phenothiazines has been associated with [[antiphospholipid syndrome]], but no causal relationship has been established.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Antiphospholipid Syndrome - Doctor&#39;s Information {{!}} Patient|url = http://patient.info/doctor/antiphospholipid-syndrome-pro|website = Patient|accessdate = 2015-07-25}}</ref>

Phenothiazine antipsychotics are classified into three groups that differ with respect to the substituent on nitrogen: the [[aliphatic compound]]s (bearing [[Open chain compound|acyclic]] groups), the "piperidines" (bearing [[piperidine]]-derived groups), and the piperazine (bearing [[piperazine]]-derived substituents).<ref name=Jaszczyszyn>Jaszczyszyn A, et al.

==Former uses==
Phenothiazine was formerly used as an insecticide and as a drug to treat infections with [[Helminths|parasitic worms]] ([[anthelminthic]]) in [[livestock]] and people, but its use for those purposes has been superseded by other chemicals.

Phenothiazine was introduced by [[DuPont]] as an [[insecticide]] in 1935.<ref name=insecticide>[http://www.clemson.edu/extension/pest_ed/histor.html History of Insecticides and Control Equipment] Clemson University Pesticide Information Program.</ref>  About 3,500,000 pounds were sold in the US in 1944.<ref>Robert Lee Metcalf. The Mode of Action of Organic Insecticides, Issues 1-5. National Academies, 1948, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PmcrAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA44 page 44]</ref>  However, because it was degraded by sunlight and air, it was difficult to determine how much to use in the field, and its use waned in the 1940s with the arrival of new pesticides like [[DDT]] that were more durable.<ref>G.

It was introduced as anthelminthic in [[livestock]] in 1940 and is considered, with [[thiabendazole]], to be the first modern anthelminthic.<ref name=Nielsen>Nielsen MK, et al.

Armstrong.  Encyclopedic Reference of Parasitology: Diseases, Treatment, Therapy, Volume 2. Springer Science & Business Media, 2001 {{ISBN|9783540668299}}</ref>{{rp|369}}

In the 1940s it also was introduced as antihelminthic for humans; since it was often given to children, the drug was often sold in chocolate, leading to the popular name, "worm chocolate."  Phenothiazine was superseded by other drugs in the 1950s.<ref name=DDD/>

The compound was originally prepared by Bernthsen in 1883 via the reaction of [[diphenylamine]] with sulfur, but more recent syntheses rely on the cyclization of 2-substituted diphenyl sulfides. Few pharmaceutically significant phenothiazines are prepared from phenothiazine,<ref>Gérard Taurand, "Phenothiazine and Derivatives" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005.{{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a19_387}}</ref> although some of them are.<ref>T.

Phenothiazines are electron donors, forming charge-transfer salts with many acceptors.
