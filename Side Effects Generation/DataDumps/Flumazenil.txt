[[Image:Flumazenil1.JPG|thumb|A vial of flumazenil solution for injection]]

'''Flumazenil''' (also known as '''flumazepil''', code name '''[[List of pharmaceutical compound number prefixes|Ro]] 15-1788''') is a selective [[benzodiazepine receptor]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]]<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Pharmacology of flumazenil|journal = Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica.

It has antagonistic and antidote properties to therapeutically used benzodiazapenes, through [[competitive inhibition]].

It was first introduced in 1987 by [[Hoffmann-La Roche]] under the trade name '''Anexate''', but only approved by the FDA on December 20, 1991. Flumazenil went off patent in 2008 so at present generic formulations of this drug are available. [[Intravenous therapy|Intravenous]] flumazenil is primarily used to treat [[benzodiazepine overdoses]] and to help reverse anesthesia. Administration of flumazenil by [[sublingual administration|sublingual]] lozenge and topical cream has also been tested.<ref name="ref-orig-13">{{cite journal|title=Modulation of Vigilance in the Primary Hypersomnias by Endogenous Enhancement of GABAA Receptors |author1=D.B.

==Medical uses==
Flumazenil is of benefit in patients who become excessively drowsy after [[benzodiazepine]]s are used for either [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] or [[therapeutic]] procedures.<ref name=gold2002>{{cite book |author=Goldfrank, Lewis R. |title=Goldfrank's toxicologic emergencies |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical Publ. Division |location=New York |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=0-07-136001-8 |oclc= |doi= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HVYyRsuUEc0C&pg=PA948&dq=flumazenil+not+to+be+used+in+overdose|accessdate=}}</ref>

It has been used as an [[antidote]] in the treatment of [[benzodiazepine overdose]]s.<ref name=gold2002/> It reverses the effects of benzodiazepines by [[competitive inhibitor|competitive inhibition]] at the benzodiazepine binding site on the GABA<sub>A</sub> [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]].  There are many complications that must be taken into consideration when used in the [[acute care]] setting.<ref name=gold2002/> These include lowered seizure threshold, agitation, and anxiousness. Flumazenil's short half-life requires multiple doses and careful patient monitoring to prevent recurrence of overdose symptoms.

It is also sometimes used to reverse the effects of benzodiazepines after surgery in a manner similar to [[naloxone]]'s application to reverse the effect of [[opiates]] and [[opioids]] following surgery. This requires careful monitoring by an anesthesiologist due to potential side effects and serious risks associated with both over-administering flumazenil and the removal of patient life-support and monitoring equipment before the benzodiazepines have worn off (due to flumazenil masking their continued effect).

Flumazenil has been effectively used to treat overdoses of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, such as [[zolpidem]], [[zaleplon]] and [[zopiclone]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Nelson, Lewis H. |author2=Flomenbaum, Neal |author3=Goldfrank, Lewis R. |author4=Hoffman, Robert Louis |author5=Howland, Mary Deems |author6=Neal A.

It may also be effective in reducing [[excessive daytime sleepiness]] while improving [[Vigilance (psychology)|vigilance]] in primary [[hypersomnias]], such as [[idiopathic hypersomnia]].<ref name="STM">{{cite journal |title=Modulation of Vigilance in the Primary Hypersomnias by Endogenous Enhancement of GABA<sub>A</sub> Receptors |author1=D.B.

It has also been used in [[hepatic encephalopathy]], though results have been mixed.<ref name="pmid11876688">{{cite journal |vauthors=Goulenok C, Bernard B, Cadranel JF |title=Flumazenil vs. placebo in hepatic encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis: a meta-analysis |journal=Aliment.

The onset of action is rapid and usually effects are seen within one to two minutes. The peak effect is seen at six to ten minutes. The recommended dose for adults is 200 μg every 1–2 minutes until the effect is seen, to a maximum of 3&nbsp;mg per hour. It is available as a clear, colourless solution for [[intravenous injection]], containing 500 μg in 5 mL.

Many benzodiazepines (including [[midazolam]]) have longer [[half-life|half-lives]] than flumazenil. Therefore, repeat doses of flumazenil may be required to prevent recurrent [[symptom]]s of overdosage once the initial dose of flumazenil wears off. It is hepatically metabolised to inactive compounds which are excreted in the urine. Subjects who are physically dependent on benzodiazepines may suffer [[benzodiazepine withdrawal]] symptoms, including [[seizure]], upon rapid administration of flumazenil.

It is not recommended for routine use in those with a decreased [[level of consciousness]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Wood, Lawrence D. H. |author2=Hall, Jesse B. |author3=Schmidt, Gregory D. 1952 |title=Principles of critical care |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |location= |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-07-141640-4 |oclc= |doi= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ss7gzGwk78gC&pg=RA11-PA1505&lpg=RA11-PA1505&dq=flumazenil+not+recommended+in+overdose |accessdate=}}</ref>

Considering its use as an antidote in benzodiazepine overdoses, orders for flumazenil may serve as a clue or trigger to initiate a more detailed prescription audit in the search for adverse drug events and clinically significant drug interactions related to the use of benzodiazepines.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kawano DF, Ueta J, Sankarankutty AK, Pereira LR, de Freitas O |title= Midazolam-related drug interactions: detection of risk situations to the patient safety in a brazilian teaching hospital |journal= J Patient Saf |year=2009 |pmid=19920444 |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=69–74 |doi= 10.1097/PTS.0b013e3181a5dafa}}</ref>

==Clinical pharmacology==
Flumazenil, an imidazobenzodiazepine derivative, antagonizes the actions of benzodiazepines on the central nervous system. Flumazenil competitively inhibits the activity at the benzodiazepine recognition site on the [[GABAA receptor|GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex]]. Because the body does not produce endogenous benzodiazepines, flumazenil only creates behavioral effects when administered concurrently with a benzodiazepine receptor agonist or inverse agonist. Flumazenil is a weak partial agonist in some animal models of activity, but has little or no agonist activity in humans.

Flumazenil does not antagonize all of the central nervous system effects of drugs affecting GABA-ergic neurons by means other than the benzodiazepine receptor (including ethanol, barbiturates, or general anesthetics) and does not reverse the effects of opioids.

In animals pretreated with high doses of benzodiazepines over several weeks, rapid administration of flumazenil elicited symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal, including seizures. A similar effect was seen in adult human subjects.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Pharmacodynamics==
Intravenous flumazenil has been shown to antagonize [[sedation]], impairment of recall, psychomotor impairment and ventilatory depression produced by benzodiazepines in healthy human volunteers.

The duration and degree of reversal of sedative benzodiazepine effects are related to the dose and plasma concentrations of flumazenil.

== Availability ==

Flumazenil is sold under a wide variety of brand names worldwide like '''Anexate, Lanexat, Mazicon, Romazicon'''. In India it is manufactured by '''Roche Bangladesh Pharmaceuticals and USAN Pharmaceuticals'''.
