'''Carbachol''' ('''Carbastat''', '''Carboptic''', '''Isopto Carbachol''', '''Miostat'''), also known as '''carbamylcholine''', is a cholinomimetic [[drug]] that binds and activates the [[acetylcholine receptor]]. Thus it is classified as a [[cholinergic agonist|cholinergic]] [[agonist]]. It is primarily used for various [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmic]] purposes, such as for treating [[glaucoma]], or for use during ophthalmic surgery. It is generally administered as an ophthalmic solution (i.e. [[eye drop]]s).

Carbachol produces effects comparable to those of [[VX nerve agent|V-series]] [[nerve agent]]s if a massive overdose is administered (as may occur following industrial and shipping accidents) and therefore constitutes a risk to human health. It is classified as an [[List of extremely hazardous substances|extremely hazardous substance]] in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. [[Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act]] (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.<ref name="gov-right-know">{{Cite journal | publisher = [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] | title = 40 C.F.R.: Appendix A to Part 355—The List of Extremely Hazardous Substances and Their Threshold Planning Quantities | url = http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2008/julqtr/pdf/40cfr355AppA.pdf | edition = July 1, 2008 | accessdate = October 29, 2011 | postscript=.}}</ref>

== Chemistry and pharmacology ==
Carbachol is a [[choline]] [[carbamate]] and a positively charged quaternary ammonium compound.<ref name="PubChem">{{cite web | url = https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=2551 | title = Carbachol | format = | work =  PubChem Compound| accessdate = 6 March 2014}}</ref> It is not well absorbed in the [[gastro-intestinal tract]] and does not cross the [[blood–brain barrier]]. It is usually administered topical ocular or through intraocular injection.<ref name="PubChem" /> Carbachol is not easily metabolized by [[cholinesterase]], it has a 2 to 5 minute onset of action and its duration of action is 4 to 8 hours with topical administration and 24 hours for intraocular administration. Since carbachol is poorly absorbed through topical administration, [[benzalkonium chloride]] is mixed in to promote absorption.<ref name="PubChem" />

Carbachol is a [[parasympathomimetic]] that [[agonist|stimulates]] both [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor|muscarinic]] and [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor|nicotinic]] receptors.<ref name="PubChem" /> In topical ocular and intraocular administration its principal effects are [[miosis]] and increased [[aqueous humour]] outflow.<ref name="PubChem" />

In the [[cat]] and [[rat]], carbachol is well known for its ability to induce [[Rapid eye movement sleep|rapid eye movement]] (REM) sleep when microinjected into the [[pons|pontine reticular]] formation. Carbachol elicits this REM sleep-like state via activation of postsynaptic muscarinic [[acetylcholine|cholinergic]] receptors ([[mAChRs]]).<ref name="PubChem" />

A recent review indicates that carbachol is a strong promoter of [[interstitial cell of Cajal|ICC]] activity, which is mediated through the [[calcium-activated chloride channel]], [[anoctamin 1]].<ref name="pmid22002868">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sanders KM, Zhu MH, Britton F, Koh SD, Ward SM | title = Anoctamins and gastrointestinal smooth muscle excitability | journal = Exp. Physiol. | volume = 97 | issue = 2 | pages = 200&ndash;206 |date=February 2012  | pmid = 22002868 | pmc = 3272164 | doi = 10.1113/expphysiol.2011.058248}}</ref>

== Indications ==
Carbachol is primarily used in the treatment of [[glaucoma]], but it is also used during ophthalmic surgery.<ref name="PubChem" /> Carbachol eyedrops are used to decrease the pressure in the eye for people with glaucoma. It is sometimes used to constrict the pupils during [[cataract]] surgery.

Topical ocular administration is used to decrease intraocular pressure in people with primary open-angle [[glaucoma]]. Intraocular administration is used to produce miosis after lens implantation during cataract surgery. Carbachol can also be used to stimulate bladder emptying if the normal emptying mechanism is not working properly.

In most countries carbachol is only available by prescription. Outside the United States, it is also indicated for urinary retention as an oral (2&nbsp;mg) tablet.<ref name="PubChem" /><ref name="ndrugs">{{cite web | url = http://www.ndrugs.com/?s=Carbachol | title = Carbachol generics| format = | work =ndrugs | accessdate = 6 March 2014}}</ref>

== Contraindications ==
Use of carbachol, as well as all other [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor|muscarinic receptor agonists]], is contraindicated in patients with [[asthma]], [[heart disease|coronary insufficiency]], gastroduodenal [[peptic ulcer|ulcers]], and [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]]. The [[parasympathomimetic]] action of this drug will exacerbate the [[symptoms]] of these disorders.

== Overdose ==
The effects of a systemic overdose will probably be similar to the effects of a [[nerve agent]] (they both act on the cholinergic system, increasing cholinergic transmission), but its toxicity is much weaker and it is easier to antagonize in overdose. When administered ocularly there is little risk of such effects, since the doses are much smaller (see topical versus systemic administration).<ref name="Lippencott's">{{cite book |editor=Richard A.
