== Uses ==
Chlorhexidine is used in disinfectants (disinfection of the skin and hands), cosmetics (additive to creams, toothpaste, deodorants, and antiperspirants), and pharmaceutical products (preservative in eye drops, active substance in wound dressings and antiseptic mouthwashes).<ref name="guanidine">{{citation | author=Thomas Güthner | contribution=Guanidine and Derivatives | title=Ullman's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry | edition=7th | publisher=Wiley | year=2007 | page=13 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> 

In [[endodontics]], chlorhexidine is used for root canal irrigation and as an intracanal dressing, <ref>Raab D: Preparation of contaminated root canal systems – the importance of antimicrobial irrigants. DENTAL INC 2008: July / August 34–36.</ref><ref>Raab D, Ma A: Preparation of contaminated root canal systems – the importance of antimicrobial irrigants. 经感染的根管系统的修复 – 化学冲洗对根管治疗的重要性DENTAL INC Chinese Edition 2008: August 18–20.</ref><ref>Raab D: "Die Bedeutung chemischer Spülungen in der Endodontie".

=== Antiseptic ===
There is tentative evidence that it is more effective than [[povidone-iodine]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dumville|first1=JC|last2=McFarlane|first2=E|last3=Edwards|first3=P|last4=Lipp|first4=A|last5=Holmes|first5=A|last6=Liu|first6=Z|title=Preoperative skin antiseptics for preventing surgical wound infections after clean surgery.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=21 April 2015|issue=4|page=CD003949|pmid=25897764}}</ref>

Chlorhexidine is active against [[Gram-positive bacteria|Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] organisms, [[facultative anaerobes]], [[aerobes]], and yeasts.<ref name="tox" /> It is particularly effective against Gram-positive bacteria (in concentrations ≥ 1&nbsp;µg/l). Significantly higher concentrations (10 to more than 73 μg/ml) are required for Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. Chlorhexidine is ineffective against [[polioviruses]] and [[adenoviruses]]. The effectiveness against herpes viruses has not yet been established unequivocally.<ref name="disinfectants">{{citation | author=Hans-P. Harke | contribution=Disinfectants | title=Ullman's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry | edition=7th | publisher=Wiley | year=2007 | pages=10–11 }}</ref>

Chlorhexidine, like other cation-active compounds, remains on the skin. It is frequently combined with alcohols (ethanol and isopropyl alcohol).

=== Dental use ===
[[File:Perichlor, 0.12% chlorhexidine glucomate solution medication.jpg|thumb|Perichlor brand 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate solution.]]
Use of a chlorhexidine-based mouthwash in combination with normal tooth care can help reduce the build-up of plaque and improve mild [[gingivitis]].<ref name=coch2017>{{cite journal |vauthors=James P, Worthington HV, Parnell C, Harding M, Lamont T, Cheung A, Whelton H, Riley P |title=Chlorhexidine mouthrinse as an adjunctive treatment for gingival health |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=3 |issue= |pages=CD008676 |year=2017 |pmid=28362061 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008676.pub2 |url=}}</ref> Such mouthwash also has a number of [[adverse effect]]s including damage to the mouth lining, tooth discoloration, [[Calculus (dental)|tartar]] build-up, and impaired taste.<ref name=coch2017/>

[[Nepal]] is the first country in the world to use chlorhexidine to treat the umbilical cord of newborn babies, and received a USAID Pioneers Prize for reducing the neonatal death rate.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nepal.usembassy.gov/pr-02-26-2014.html |title=USAID Recognizes the Government of Nepal for their Leadership in Saving Newborn Lives |date=February 26, 2014 |publisher=Embassy of the United States, Kathmandu – Nepal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228175015/http://nepal.usembassy.gov/pr-02-26-2014.html |archivedate=December 28, 2014 |df= }}</ref> Chlorhexidine is very effective for poor countries like Nepal and its use is growing in the world for treating the umbilical cord. A 2015 [[Cochrane review]] has yielded high-quality evidence that within the community setting, chlorhexidine skin or cord care can reduce the incidence of [[omphalitis]] (inflammation of the [[umbilical cord]]) by 50% and also neonatal mortality by 12%.<ref>{{Cite journal | vauthors = Sinha A, Sazawal S, Pradhan A, Ramji S, Opiyo N | title = Chlorhexidine skin or cord care for prevention of mortality and infections in neonates | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | page = CD007835| year = 2015 | pmid = 25739381 | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007835.pub2}}</ref>
Chlorhexidine gluconate is used as a skin cleanser for surgical scrubs, a cleanser for skin wounds, for preoperative skin preparation and germicidal hand rinses.<ref name="tox" /> Chlorhexidine eye drops have been used as a treatment for eyes affected by [[Acanthamoeba keratitis|''Acanthamoeba'' keratitis]].<ref name="Alkharashi">{{cite journal |vauthors=Alkharashi M, Lindsley K, Law HA, Sikder S |title= Medical interventions for acanthamoeba keratitis |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume=2 |page= CD0010792 |date=2015 |pmid= 25710134|doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD010792.pub2 |pmc=4730543}}</ref>

== Side effects ==

Chlorhexidine does not meet current European specifications for a hand disinfectant. Under the test conditions of the European Standard EN 1499, no significant difference in the efficacy was found between a 4% solution of chlorhexidine digluconate and soap.<ref name="disinfectants" /> In the U.S., between 2007 and 2009, [[Hunter Holmes McGuire Veterans Administration Medical Center]] conducted a cluster-randomized trial and concluded that daily bathing of patients in intensive care units with washcloths saturated with chlorhexidine gluconate reduced the risk of hospital-acquired infections.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/daily-bathing-antiseptic-agent-significantly-reduces-risk-hospital-acquired-infections |title=Daily Bathing With Antiseptic Agent Significantly Reduces Risk of Hospital-Acquired Infections in Intensive Care Unit Patients |date=2014-04-23 |accessdate=2014-04-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113133136/https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/daily-bathing-antiseptic-agent-significantly-reduces-risk-hospital-acquired-infections |archivedate=2017-01-13 |df= }}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
At physiologic [[pH]], chlorhexidine salts dissociate and release the positively charged chlorhexidine [[Ion#Anions and cations|cation]]. The bactericidal effect is a result of the binding of this cationic molecule to negatively charged bacterial cell walls. At low concentrations of chlorhexidine, this results in a [[Bacteriostatic agent|bacteriostatic]] effect; at high concentrations, membrane disruption results in cell death.<ref name="tox">{{citation | editor1-last=Leikin | editor1-first=Jerrold B. | editor2-last=Paloucek | editor2-first=Frank P. | contribution=Chlorhexidine Gluconate | title=Poisoning and Toxicology Handbook | edition=4th | publisher=Informa | year=2008 | pages=183–84 }}</ref>

==Chemistry==
It is a cationic polybiguanide ([[bisbiguanide]]).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Tanzer JM, Slee AM, Kamay BA |title=Structural requirements of guanide, biguanide, and bisbiguanide agents for antiplaque activity |journal=Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=721–9 |year=1977 |pmid=931371 |url=http://aac.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=931371 |doi= 10.1128/aac.12.6.721|pmc=430011}}</ref> It is used primarily as its salts (e.g., the dihydrochloride, diacetate, and digluconate).

== Deactivation ==
Chlorhexidine is deactivated by forming insoluble salts with [[anionic]] compounds, including the anionic [[surfactants]] commonly used as detergents in toothpastes and mouthwashes, anionic [[thickeners]] such as [[Polyacrylic acid|carbomer]], and anionic [[emulsifiers]] such as acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, among many others.  For this reason, chlorhexidine mouth rinses should be used at least 30 minutes after other dental products.<ref name=Denton>{{cite book |last=Denton |first=Graham W |chapter=Chlorhexidine |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=3f-kPJ17_TYC&pg=PA321 |editor1-last=Block  |editor1-first=Seymour S |year=2000 |title=Disinfection, Sterilization, and Preservation |edition=5th |publisher=[[Lippincott Williams & Wilkins]] |pages=321–36 |isbn=978-0-683-30740-5}}</ref> For best effectiveness, food, drink, smoking, and mouth rinses should be avoided for at least one hour after use.  Many topical skin products, cleansers, and hand sanitizers should also be avoided to prevent deactivation when chlorhexidine (a topical itself or the residue from a cleanser) is meant to remain on the skin.

== Synthesis ==
The structure is based on two molecules of [[proguanil]], linked with a [[hexamethylenediamine]] [[Spacer (chemistry)|spacer]].
