'''Olaratumab''' (trade name '''Lartruvo''') is a [[monoclonal antibody]] developed by [[Eli Lilly and Company]] for the treatment of [[solid tumor]]s. It is directed against the [[platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha]].<ref>[http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/365/olaratumab.pdf Statement on a Nonproprietary name adopted by the USAN Council: Olaratumab]</ref>

== Medical uses ==
Olaratumab is used in combination with [[doxorubicin]] for the treatment of adults with advanced [[soft-tissue sarcoma]] (STS) who cannot be cured by [[cancer surgery]] or [[radiation therapy]], and who have not been previously treated with doxorubicin.<ref name="EPAR">{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Product_Information/human/004216/WC500216869.pdf|title=EPAR – Product information for Lartruvo|date=23 November 2016|publisher=[[European Medicines Agency]]}}</ref><ref name="FDA" />

In a [[randomised controlled trial]] with 133 STS patients, olaratumab plus doxorubicin improved the [[median]] of [[progression-free survival]] from 4.1 to 6.6 months as compared to doxorubicin alone ([[p-value|p]] = 0.0615, narrowly missing [[statistical significance]]), and overall survival from 14.7 to 26.5 months (p = 0.0003, highly significant).<ref name="EPAR" /><ref>{{cite journal|title=Olaratumab and doxorubicin versus doxorubicin alone for treatment of soft-tissue sarcoma: an open-label phase 1b and randomised phase 2 trial|journal=Lancet|volume=388|issue=10043|pages=488–97|pmid=27291997|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30587-6|year=2016|author1=Tap|first1=W.

== Contraindications ==
The drug has no contraindications apart from [[hypersensitivity]] reactions.<ref name="EPAR" />

== Side effects ==
In studies, the most serious side effects of the combination olaratumab/doxorubicin were [[neutropenia]] (low count of [[neutrophil]] white blood cells) with a severity of grade 3 or 4 in 55% of patients, and musculoskeletal pain grade 3 or 4 in 8% of patients. Common milder side effects were [[lymphopenia]], headache, diarrhoea, [[nausea]] and vomiting, [[mucositis]], and reactions at the infusion site;<ref name="EPAR" /> all typical effects of cancer therapies.

== Interactions ==
No [[pharmacokinetic]] interactions with doxorubicin were observed in studies. Being a monoclonal antibody, olaratumab is neither metabolised by [[cytochrome P450]] liver enzymes nor transported by [[transmembrane pump]]s, and is thus not expected to interact relevantly with other drugs.<ref name="EPAR" />

== Pharmacology ==
=== Mechanism of action ===
Olaratumab inhibits growth of tumour cells by blocking subunit alpha of the [[platelet-derived growth factor receptor]], a type of [[tyrosine kinase]].<ref name="EPAR" />

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
After [[intravenous infusion]], olaratumab has a [[volume of distribution]] of 7.7 litres in steady state and a [[biological half-life]] of 11 days.<ref name="EPAR" />

== History ==
Olaratumab was originally developed by [[ImClone Systems]], which was acquired by [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] in 2008.<ref>{{cite news|title=

In February 2015, the [[European Medicines Agency]] assigned olaratumab [[orphan drug]] status for the treatment of soft-tissue sarcoma.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/orphans/2015/04/human_orphan_001537.jsp|publisher=[[European Medicines Agency]]|date=9 April 2015|title=Orphan Designation for olaratumab}}</ref> The [[European Commission]] granted a conditional marketing authorisation, based on the mentioned Phase II study, valid throughout the [[European Union]] on 9 November 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Summary_for_the_public/human/004216/WC500216872.pdf|title=EPAR summary for the public for Lartruvo|date=23 November 2016|publisher=[[European Medicines Agency]]}}</ref>

Considered a promising drug, the FDA granted olaratumab [[fast track (FDA)|fast track]] designation, [[breakthrough therapy]] designation and [[priority review (FDA)|priority review]] status.
In October 2016, the US [[FDA]] issued an [[Accelerated approval (FDA)|accelerated approval]] notice for use of olaratumab with doxorubicin to treat adults with certain types of soft-tissue sarcoma, based on the same study.<ref name="FDA">{{cite web|title=FDA grants accelerated approval to new treatment for advanced soft tissue sarcoma|date=19 October 2016|publisher=[[US FDA]]|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm525878.htm}}</ref><ref name="Shirley">{{cite journal|title=Olaratumab: First Global Approval|journal=Drugs|pmid=27995580|doi=10.1007/s40265-016-0680-2|year=2016|author1=Shirley|first1=M}}</ref>

A Phase III trial started in September 2015 and is expected to complete in September 2020.<ref name="Shirley" /><ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT02451943|A Study of Doxorubicin Plus Olaratumab (LY3012207) in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma (ANNOUNCE)}}</ref>
