'''Blinatumomab''' (trade name '''Blincyto''', previously known as '''AMG103''' and MT103) is a [[biopharmaceutical]] drug used as a [[Therapy#Lines_of_therapy|second-line treatment]] for [[Philadelphia chromosome]]-negative relapsed or refractory [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]]. It belongs to a class of constructed [[monoclonal antibodies]], [[bi-specific T-cell engager]]s (BiTEs), that exert action selectively and direct the human immune system to act against tumor cells. Blinatumomab specifically targets the [[CD19]] [[antigen]] present on [[B cell]]s.<ref name="usanname">{{cite web | url=http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/usan/x-pub/blinatumomab.pdf | title=blinatumomab | format=PDF | website=United States Adopted Names Council » [[United States Adopted Name|Adopted Names]] | year=2008 | id=N08/16 | publisher=[[American Medical Association]] }}{{registration required}}</ref>  In December 2014 it was approved by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] under the [[FDA Accelerated Approval|accelerated approval]] program; marketing authorization depended on the outcome of clinical trials that were ongoing at the time of approval.<ref name=Label/><ref> Food and Drug Administration  December 3, 2014 [http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/ApprovedDrugs/ucm425597.htm FDA Press release: Blinatumomab]</ref> When it launched, blinatumomab was priced at $178,000 per year in the United States; only about 1,000 people were eligible to take the drug, based on its label.<ref name=Fierce/>

== Medical use ==
Blinatumomab is used as a [[Therapy#Lines_of_therapy|second-line treatment]] for [[Philadelphia chromosome]]-negative relapsed or refractory Bcell precursor [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]].<ref name=Label>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/125557lbl.pdf Blinatumomab label] Updated  12/2014</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==
[[File:BiTE antibody en.svg|thumb|right|Blinatumomab linking a [[T cell]] to a malignant B cell.]]
Blinatumomab enables a patient's [[T cells]] to recognize [[Malignancy|malignant]] B cells. A molecule of blinatumomab combines two binding sites: a [[CD3 (immunology)|CD3]] site for T cells and a [[CD19]] site for the target B cells. CD3 is part of the [[T cell receptor]]. The drug works by linking these two cell types and [[T cell activation#Activation|activating the T cell]] to exert [[cytotoxic]] activity on the target cell.<ref>{{cite journal|doi = 10.1016/j.molimm.2006.09.032|pmid = 17083975|last1 = Mølhøj|first1 = M|last2 = Crommer|first2 = S|last3 = Brischwein|first3 = K|last4 = Rau|first4 = D|last5 = Sriskandarajah|first5 = M|last6 = Hoffmann|first6 = P|last7 = Kufer|first7 = P|last8 = Hofmeister|first8 = R|last9 = Baeuerle|first9 = PA|title = CD19-/CD3-bispecific antibody of the BiTE class is far superior to tandem diabody with respect to redirected tumor cell lysis|journal = [[Mol.

== History ==
The drug (originally known as MT103) was developed by a German-American company [[Micromet]], Inc. in cooperation with [[Lonza Group|Lonza]]; In 2012 Micromet was purchased by [[Amgen]], which has furthered the drug's clinical trials. 

In July 2014, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy status to blinatumomab for the treatment of [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] (ALL).<ref name="amgenpr201407">{{cite press release | url=http://www.amgen.com/media/media_pr_detail.jsp?releaseID=1944069 | title=Amgen Receives FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation For Investigational BiTE® Antibody Blinatumomab In Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia | date=1 July 2014 | publisher=[[Amgen]] }}</ref> In October 2014, Amgen’s [[Biologics License Application]] for blinatumomab was granted priority review designation by the [[FDA]], thus establishing a deadline of May 19, 2015 for completion of the FDA review process.<ref name="amgenpr201410">{{cite press release | url=http://www.amgen.com/media/media_pr_detail.jsp?releaseID=1975963 | title=Amgen's BiTE® Immunotherapy Blinatumomab Receives FDA Priority Review Designation In Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia | publisher=[[Amgen]] | date=9 October 2014 }}</ref>  

On December 3, 2014, the drug was approved for use in the United States to treat [[Philadelphia chromosome]]-negative relapsed or refractory [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] under the [[FDA]]'s [[FDA Accelerated Approval|accelerated approval]] program; marketing authorization depended on the outcome of clinical trials that were ongoing at the time of approval.<ref name=Label/><ref name="nature7530">{{cite journal |journal = Nature|page = 149|title = Business: Antibody advance|department = Seven Days|type = paper|volume = 516|date = 11 December 2014|issue = 7530|doi = 10.1038/516148a|at = }}{{Open access}}</ref>

==Cost==
When blinatumomab was approved, Amgen announced that the price for the drug would be $178,000 per year, which made it the most expensive cancer drug on the market. Merck's [[pembrolizumab]] was priced at $150,000 per year when it launched (in Sept 2014); unlike that drug and others, only about 1,000 people can be given the drug, based on its label.<ref name=Fierce>Tracy Staton for FiercePharmaMarketing. December 18, 2014 [http://www.fiercepharmamarketing.com/story/amgen-slaps-record-breaking-178k-price-rare-leukemia-drug-blincyto/2014-12-18 Amgen slaps record-breaking $178K price on rare leukemia drug Blincyto]</ref>

Peter Bach, director of the [[Center for Health Policy and Outcomes]] at [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]], has calculated that according to "value-based pricing," assuming that the value of a year of life is $121,000 with a 15% "toxicity discount,"  the market price of blinaumomab should be $12,612 a month, compared to the market price of $64,260 a month. A representative of Amgen said, “The price of Blincyto reflects the significant clinical, economic and humanistic value of the product to patients and the health-care system. The price also reflects the complexity of developing, manufacturing and reliably supplying innovative biologic medicines.”<ref name=Wall2015>{{cite news|author1=Peter Loftus|title=How Much Should Cancer Drugs Cost?
