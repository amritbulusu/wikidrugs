'''Dydrogesterone''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]]) (brand name '''Duphaston'''), also known as '''isopregnenone''' or '''6-dehydroretroprogesterone''', as well as '''9β,10α-pregna-4,6-diene-3,20-dione''', is a [[steroid]]al [[progestin]] of the [[retroprogesterone]] group that was developed in the 1950s and introduced for clinical use in 1961.<ref name="Elks2014">{{cite book|author=J.

Dydrogesterone has selective progestational activity and does not inhibit [[ovulation]].<ref>{{cite journal | authorlink = Tausk M.A  | title = Pharmacology of the Endocrine System and Related Drugs: Progesterone, Progestational Drugs and Antifertility Drugs | journal = International Encyclopaedia of Pharmacology and Therapeutics. | volume = 48 | pages = 481 | date = 1972 }}</ref> The greater rigidity of dydrogesterone also positively affects its [[Chemoselectivity|selectivity]],<ref>{{cite journal|author=Schindler AE|title=Progestational effects of dydrogesterone in vitro, in vivo and on the human endometrium.|date=6 December 2009|pmid=19969432|doi=10.1016/j.maturitas.2009.10.011|volume=65 Suppl 1|journal=Maturitas|pages=S3-11}}</ref> while natural progesterone is less selective, existing in different conformations that more easily bind to different [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s. As a consequence of its better bioavailability and the progestational activity of its main [[metabolite]]s (20-, 21- and 16-hydroxy derivatives), the equivalent dose of dydrogesterone is 10–20 times lower than that of oral [[Progesterone#Medical uses|micronized progesterone]].

Dydrogesterone is used as an effective, orally active progestogen for [[Gynaecology#Diseases|gynaecological conditions]] related to a wide variety of progesterone [[Deficiency (medicine)|deficiencies]] in pregnant women.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsc.org/learn-chemistry/resource/rws00008699/dydrogesterone |title=Dydrogesterone |work=[[Royal Society of Chemistry]]}}</ref> The [[molecular structure]] and [[pharmacological]] effects are somewhat similar to [[Endogeny|endogenous]] progesterone, although in smaller amounts it is found to be orally active. Its freedom from hormonal effects like those related to [[corticoid]], [[androgen]]ic, [[estrogenic]], [[anabolic]], and other effects gives dydrogesterone an advantage over other [[Organic synthesis|synthesized]] progestogens.<ref name="What is Duphaston">{{cite web |url=http://www.prescriptionmedications.in/2015/01/12/duphaston.html |title=What is Duphaston |work=PrescriptionMedications.in}}</ref>

Dydrogesterone when used therapeutically is closely related to its physiological action on the [[Neuroendocrine cell|neuro-endocrine]] control of ovarian function, as well as on the [[endometrium]]. This is an indication in all cases of endogeneous progesterone deficiency - relative or absolute. The molecule was licensed for use in several indications, including threatened  or recurrent miscarriage, dysfunctional bleeding, infertility due to luteal insufficiency, [[dysmenorrhea]], [[endometriosis]], secondary [[amenorrhoea]], [[Irregular menstruation|irregular cycles]], [[Premenstrual syndrome|pre-menstrual syndrome]] and also as a [[hormone replacement therapy]].<ref name="Dydrogesterone review">{{cite web |url=http://www.medicalook.com/reviews/Dydrogesterone.html |title=Dydrogesterone review |work=MedicaLook.com}}</ref>

Dydrogesterone is relatively safe and well tolerated, and does not exhibit the androgenic side effects that are common with some other progestins, like [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]] and [[norethisterone]].

Dydrogesterone has also been registered as hormone replacement therapy (HRT)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nhs.uk/Medicine-Guides/Pages/MedicineOverview.aspx?condition=Hormone%20replacement%20therapy&medicine=Dydrogesterone/Estradiol | title=Dydrogesterone/Estradiol Hormone Replacement Therapy |work=[[National Health Service]]}}</ref> to counter-check the negative effects of unopposed estrogen on the endometrium in women with an intact uterus.

===Menstrual disorders===

====Dysmenorrhea====
Primary or essential dysmenorrhea is a very common gynaecological phenomenon experienced by women during their reproductive years. Clinical studies have shown symptom relief and a reduction in pain with dydrogesterone treatment for dysmenorrhea.<ref name="pmid17943543" />

====Secondary amenorrhoea====
Secondary amenorrhoea is not a specific disease, but is instead a symptom. Dydrogesterone has been found to adequately induce bleeding within a sufficiently estrogen-primed endometrium. When [[estradiol]] levels are found to be low, dydrogesterone treatment is more effective when supplemented with [[estrogen]]s.<ref>{{cite journal

|pages=611–8
}}</ref>

====Dysfunctional uterine bleeding and irregular cycles====
Apart from a wide variety of medications in use to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding in patients with ovulatory cycles, oral progestogens like dydrogesterone have been found to be the most commonly prescribed as it has been found to prevent heavy bleeding.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thescipub.com/PDF/amjsp.2010.23.26.pdf |title=A Comparative Study between Norethisterone Progestogens and Dydrogesterone in the Treatment of Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding |work=Science Publications }}</ref>

===Infertility due to luteal insufficiency===
Oral dydrogesterone is effective drug, well tolerated and accepted among patients and can be considered for routine [[luteal support]]. Advantage of dydrogesterone is oral administration, easy to use and better patient [[Compliance (medicine)|compliance]] which results in high satisfaction score of oral dydrogesterone in luteal support of [[In vitro fertilisation|IVF]]/[[Intracytoplasmic sperm injection|ICSI]] cycles.<ref name="pmid25622239">{{cite journal

According to the latest [[Cochrane Library|Cochrane review]] (2015), no evidence showed a difference between synthetic and micronized progesterone for luteal phase support in terms of successful pregnancies.
Dydrogesterone is used for luteal support in IVF protocols, for treatment of recurrent pregnancy loss.<ref name="Loose 2006">{{cite book |author1=Loose, Davis S. |author2=Stancel, George M. |editor1=Brunton, Laurence L. |editor2=Lazo, John S. |editor3=Parker, Keith L. |year=2006 | chapter=Estrogens and Progestins |title=Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics |edition=11th |pages=1541–71 |location=New York | publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=0-07-142280-3}}</ref>

===Miscarriage===
Threatened [[miscarriage]] is defined as bleeding during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy while the cervix is closed. It is the most common complication in pregnancy, occurring in 20% of all pregnancies. [[Recurrent miscarriage|Recurrent abortion]] is defined as the loss of three or more consecutive pregnancies. Dydrogesterone is associated with approximately two-fold significant reduction in the miscarriage rate as compared to standard care in threatened and recurrent miscarriages with minimal side effects.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="pmid22794306">{{cite journal

===Endometriosis===
Endometriosis is a chronic disease which can cause severe, progressive, and at times, incapacitating dysmenorrhoea, [[pelvic pain]], [[dyspareunia]] and [[infertility]]. Dydrogesterone relieves pain without inhibiting ovulation, so that patients are able to become pregnant during treatment. Dydrogesterone is particularly suitable in cases where the woman desires to become pregnant and to prevent bleeding problems.<ref name="pmid19945806">{{cite journal

}}</ref> The amount and duration of menstrual bleeding is also significantly reduced, and from the end of the third month onwards, bleeding was considered normal in the majority of patients. Improvement of endometriosis was observed in 71% of patients and cure in 21%.

===Premenstrual syndrome===
Dydrogesterone has shown reasonable efficacy in relieving a number of premenstrual syndrome symptoms like [[mood swing]]s & physical symptoms.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Hormone replacement therapy===
The objective behind hormone replacement therapy is to actively increase the circulating levels of estrogen to control [[Hot flash|hot flushes]] and to prevent the long-term effects of the [[menopause]], such as [[bone resorption]] and unfavourable changes in [[blood lipids]]. The administration of 17β-[[Estradiol|oestradiol]] halts, or reverses [[Atrophy|atrophic]] changes that occur due to the loss of endogenous oestradiol during the menopause.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://press.endocrine.org/doi/full/10.1210/jc.2009-2509 |title=Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy: An Endocrine Society Scientific Statement |work=[[The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism]] }}</ref>

Estrogen promotes endometrial cell growth and in [[Menopause#Postmenopause|postmenopausal]] women with an intact uterus, estrogen [[Combination therapy|monotherapy]] results in continued endometrial development without the physiological secretory changes normally brought on by progesterone. This action is associated with an increased incidence of endometrial [[hyperplasia]] and [[carcinoma]]. Additional protection with progestogens is therefore important in patients with an intact uterus who receive [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|estrogen replacement therapy]]. Dydrogesterone counters the [[Cell growth|proliferative]] effect of estrogens on the endometrium and ensures the transition to a secretory pattern and cyclical shedding of the endometrium in serial HRT regimes. Dydrogesterone effectively protects against the [[Ontogeny|ontogenesis]] of endometrial hyperplasia. Unlike androgenic progestogens, dydrogesterone does not reverse the benefits brought on by 17β-oestradiol on lipid profiles and carbohydrate metabolism. In a continuous, combined HRT regimen, dydrogesterone retards the proliferation of the endometrium so that it remains atrophic or inactive.<ref>{{cite journal

===Breast disorders===
Cyclic treatment with low-dose (10&nbsp;mg/day) dydrogesterone has been found to be effective in the treatment of [[fibrocystic breast changes]] and associated [[mastodynia]] (breast pain).<ref name="pmid12227885">{{cite journal | vauthors = Winkler UH, Schindler AE, Brinkmann US, Ebert C, Oberhoff C | title = Cyclic progestin therapy for the management of mastopathy and mastodynia | journal = Gynecol.

==Safety==

===Pregnancy===
Dydrogesterone has been [[Medical prescription|prescribed]] and used in over 10 million pregnancies worldwide. There have been no harmful effects exhibited due to the use of dydrogesterone while pregnant. Dydrogesterone is safe to use during pregnancy only when prescribed and indicated by a [[Health professional|medical practitioner]].<ref name="Duphaston 10mg Film-Coated Tablets" />

===Fertility===
Studies have not shown any incidence of decreased fertility due to dydrogesterone at therapeutic dose.<ref name="Duphaston 10mg Film-Coated Tablets" />

===Overdose===
There is not enough clinical data to support [[Drug overdose|overdose]] in humans. 360&nbsp;mg is the maximum dose taken to date by humans and dydrogesterone was found to be well-tolerated at that oral dose. Additionally, there are no [[antidote]]s to overdose and subsequent treatments should be based on patient [[symptom]]s.<ref name="Duphaston 10mg Film-Coated Tablets" />

===Toxicology===
No severe or unforeseen [[toxicity]] have been accounted for with the use of dydrogesterone. In acute toxicity trials, the LD<sub>50</sub> doses in rats were in excess of 4,640&nbsp;mg/kg orally.<ref name="Dydrogesterone"/>

The [[Ames test]] found no evidence of any potential [[mutagen]]ic or toxicity properties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+3321 |title=DYDROGESTERONE |work=[[United States National Library of Medicine]]}}</ref>

==Side effects==
The most commonly reported drug related adverse reactions of patients treated with dydrogesterone without estrogen treatment in clinical trials of indications are [[migraine]]s, [[headaches]], [[nausea]], menstrual disorders and [[mastodynia|breast pain/tenderness]],<ref name="MishellKirschbaum">{{cite book|author1=Daniel R.

The use of progestins, in particular [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]], in treating post-menopausal symptoms have been associated with increased risk of [[Thrombus|blood clots]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/womens-health/medicines/femoston.html |title=Femoston |work=NetDoctor.co.uk}}</ref> and [[breast cancer]] in a study carried out by the [[Women's Health Initiative]].

==Interactions==
In HRT, dydrogesterone is administered together with an estrogen. Therefore, the interaction between dydrogesterone and estrogens has been assessed, and no clinically significant interaction has been observed.

==Pharmacology==
Dydrogesterone is a highly selective progestogen, and due to its unique structure, unlike progesterone and many other progestins, binds almost exclusively to the PR.<ref name="SchindlerCampagnoli2003">{{cite journal|last1=Schindler|first1=Adolf E|last2=Campagnoli|first2=Carlo|last3=Druckmann|first3=René|last4=Huber|first4=Johannes|last5=Pasqualini|first5=Jorge R|last6=Schweppe|first6=Karl W|last7=Thijssen|first7=Jos H.H|title=Classification and pharmacology of progestins|journal=Maturitas|volume=46|year=2003|pages=7–16|issn=0378-5122|doi=10.1016/j.maturitas.2003.09.014|pmid=14670641}}</ref> The [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] of dydrogesterone for the PR is relatively low at 15.9% of that of progesterone.<ref name="CabezaHeuze2014">{{cite journal|last1=Cabeza|first1=Marisa|last2=Heuze|first2=Yvonne|last3=Sánchez|first3=Araceli|last4=Garrido|first4=Mariana|last5=Bratoeff|first5=Eugene|title=Recent advances in structure of progestins and their binding to progesterone receptors|journal=Journal of Enzyme Inhibition and Medicinal Chemistry|volume=30|issue=1|year=2014|pages=152–159|issn=1475-6366|doi=10.3109/14756366.2014.895719}}</ref> However, ''[[in vivo]]'', dydrogesterone is much more potent in comparison, with an equivalent dose, in terms of [[endometrium|endometrial]] [[cell proliferation|proliferation]], that is 10 to 20 times lower than that of progesterone.<ref name="ColomboFerraboschi2006">{{cite journal|last1=Colombo|first1=Diego|last2=Ferraboschi|first2=Patrizia|last3=Prestileo|first3=Paolo|last4=Toma|first4=Lucio|title=A comparative molecular modeling study of dydrogesterone with other progestational agents through theoretical calculations and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|journal=The Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology|volume=98|issue=1|year=2006|pages=56–62|issn=0960-0760|doi=10.1016/j.jsbmb.2005.07.009|pmid=16216490}}</ref> This is due to [[pharmacokinetic]] differences between the two drugs, namely improved [[bioavailability]] and [[metabolic stability]] with dydrogesterone as well as additional progestogenic activity of its [[metabolite]]s.<ref name="Schindler2009">{{cite journal|last1=Schindler|first1=Adolf E.|title=Progestational effects of dydrogesterone in vitro, in vivo and on the human endometrium|journal=Maturitas|volume=65|year=2009|pages=S3–S11|issn=0378-5122|doi=10.1016/j.maturitas.2009.10.011|pmid=19969432}}</ref> Although dydrogesterone binds to both [[isoform]]s of the PR and has similar activity as an [[agonist]] of the [[Progesterone receptor#Isoforms|PR<sub>B</sub>]] as progesterone,<ref name="CabezaHeuze2014" /> its agonistic activity is weak in the case of the [[Progesterone receptor#Isoforms|PR<sub>A</sub>]].<ref name="CabezaHeuze2014" /> Hence, dydrogesterone shows selectivity for PR<sub>B</sub> activation.<ref name="CabezaHeuze2014" /> This could confer a therapeutic advantage, as the two receptor isoforms induce different physiological responses in target tissues.<ref name="CabezaHeuze2014" />

Dydrogesterone does not bind to the [[androgen receptor]], [[estrogen receptor]], or [[glucocorticoid receptor]].<ref name="CabezaHeuze2014" /> As such, it is devoid of [[androgen]]ic, [[estrogen]]ic, or [[glucocorticoid]] activity.<ref name="SchindlerCampagnoli2003" /> Similarly to progesterone however, dydrogesterone binds to the [[mineralocorticoid receptor]] and possesses [[antimineralocorticoid]] activity, but only weakly so.<ref name="Kuhl2009" /> Due to its activity as a progestogen, dydrogesterone can produce [[antigonadotropic]] effects.<ref name="BorisStevenson1966">{{cite journal|last1=Boris|first1=Alfred|last2=Stevenson|first2=Richard H.|last3=Trmal|first3=Thelma|title=Some studies of the endocrine properties of dydrogesterone|journal=Steroids|volume=7|issue=1|year=1966|pages=1–10|issn=0039-128X|doi=10.1016/0039-128X(66)90131-0}}</ref> However, it does not suppress [[gonadotropin]] secretion or inhibit [[ovulation]] at typical clinical dosages.<ref name="Kuhl2009" /><ref name="Mittal2013">{{cite book|author=Suneeta Mittal|title=Threatened Miscarriage - ECAB|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IF-hYuUy7j0C&pg=PT42|date=12 July 2013|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=81-312-3233-6|pages=42–}}</ref> Unlike progesterone, which forms [[sedation|sedative]] [[neurosteroid]] metabolites, dydrogesterone is not able to be metabolized in a similar way due to structural differences, and for this reason, is non-sedative.<ref name="Kuhl2009" />

===Effects and properties===
When administered orally dydrogesterone has advantageous pharmacological properties compared to endogenous progesterone:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.maturitas.org/article/S0378-5122(03)00330-X/fulltext#Dydrogesterone | title=Classification and pharmacology of progestins |work=[[Maturitas]]}}</ref>

* It is orally active at low dosages.
* It has selective progestogenic properties without any traditional hormonal activity.
* The amount absorbed is more predictable than for progesterone, since it is not broken down as easily when passing through the digestive system.

Dydrogesterone is characterised by progestational and PR-mediated [[antiestrogen]]ic activity.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01647360 | title=Severity of Bleeding as a Predictor of Quality of Life (QoL) in Women With Heavy Menstrual Bleeding (HMB) Under Dydrogesterone Treatment |work=[[ClinicalTrials.gov]]}}</ref> This is demonstrated by its ability to induce a secretory transformation in the endometrium of immature or ovariectomised animals after they have been primed with estrogens (cf. the [[Carl Clauberg#Clauberg test|Clauberg test]]). The oral progestogenic potency of dydrogesterone is 20 times higher than that of progesterone.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/7552927_Oral_dydrogesterone_versus_intravaginal_micronised_progesterone_as_luteal_phase_support_in_assisted_reproductive_technology_(ART)_cycles_results_of_a_randomised_study | title=Oral dydrogesterone versus intravaginal micronised progesterone as luteal phase support in assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles: results of a randomised study. |work=[[ResearchGate]]}}</ref>
The progestational efficacy and potency of dydrogesterone was confirmed by standard test (i.e. delay of menses and induction of withdrawal bleeding). The benefits of estrogen or other target organs are not compromised by dydrogesterone.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.maturitas.org/article/S0378-5122(09)00392-2/fulltext#Unique%20properties%20of%20the%20progestogen%20dydrogesterone | title=Classification and pharmacology of progestins |work=[[Maturitas]] |url-access=subscription}}</ref>

Unlike many other synthetic progestogens, dydrogesterone is not chemically related to testosterone.<ref name="What is Duphaston"/> Its low affinity for the [[androgen receptor]] explains why it has no unwanted androgenic effects even at high doses and after prolonged treatment showed:

* No [[virilization]] ([[Acne vulgaris|acne]], voice changes, [[hirsutism]]) of the adult female.
* No virilising effects on the [[Female reproductive system|genital tract]] of the female fetus.
* No effect on the fertility of the offspring.

Dydrogesterone is not converted into estrogen, and has no adverse estrogenic effects on fertility or sexual development.

At recommended doses, dydrogesterone has no effect on ovulation in healthy women:

* The [[Drug metabolism|biphasic]] pattern of the [[basal body temperature]] is maintained.
* Normal ovulatory rise in estrogen and pregnanediol.
* Normal premenstrual [[biopsy]].
* No modification of vaginal [[cytology]].
* Cytological evidence of ovulation.
* The formation of the [[corpus luteum]] has been confirmed by [[laparotomy]].

These beneficial results are of particular relevance to the use of dydrogesterone in women who wish to become pregnant.

==Pharmacokinetics==

===Absorption===
Dydrogesterone has predictable [[pharmacokinetics]]. The single-dose kinetics are linear in the oral dose range of 2.5–10&nbsp;mg. The pharmacokinetics do not change during repeated administration of up to 20&nbsp;mg dydrogesterone once daily. [[Steady state#Physiology|Steady state]] is attained after 3 days of treatment.<ref name="Duphaston 10mg Film-Coated Tablets"/>

===Distribution===
The [[plasma protein binding]] of dydrogesterone and 20α-DHD are unknown, but based on the plasma protein binding of other progestins, they are probably bound to [[human serum albumin|albumin]] and not to [[sex hormone-binding globulin]] or [[corticosteroid-binding globulin]].<ref name="FRCOG2015" /><ref name="Kuhl2009" />

===Metabolism===
Dydrogesterone is readily absorbed after oral administration. [[Transport maximum|T<sub>max</sub>]] values vary between 0.5 and 2.5 hours.<ref name=":2">{{cite web | url=http://www.old.health.gov.il/units/pharmacy/trufot/alonim/duphaston_dr_1272874913497.pdf | title=Duphaston Prescribing Information |work=[[Ministry of Health (Israel)]]}}</ref> Dydrogesterone is virtually completely metabolized, which occurs in the [[liver]].<ref>{{cite journal | authorlink = Howard J.A. Carp. | title = Recurrent Pregnancy Loss. Causes, Controversies, and Treatment. | journal = Second Edition | volume =  | pages =  | date = 2015 }}</ref> The primary reaction (metabolic) is the [[hydrogenation]] of the 20-[[Ketone|keto group]] mainly by [[AKR1C1]] and to a lesser extent [[AKR1C3]], resulting in [[20α-dihydrodydrogesterone]] (20α-DHD), which is a potent progestogen similarly to dydrogesterone.<ref name="BeraničGobec2011" /> The levels of 20α-DHD, which is the main active metabolite, are also found to peak about 1.5 hours post-dose.<ref name="Duphaston 10mg Film-Coated Tablets">{{cite web | url=http://www.medicines.ie/medicine/5163/SPC/Duphaston+10mg+Film-Coated+Tablets/ | title=Duphaston 10mg Film-Coated Tablets |work=medicines.ie Ireland}}</ref>

After oral administration, it was found that [[Blood plasma|plasma]] concentrations of 20α-DHD were substantially heightened than those of the primary drug. The ratios of 20α-DHD and dydrogesterone for [[Area under the curve (pharmacokinetics)|AUC]] and [[Cmax (pharmacology)|C<sub>max</sub>]] are in the order of 40 and 25, respectively. Absolute bioavailability is on average 28%.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.medicines.ie/printfriendlydocument.aspx?documentid=5165&companyid=3070 | title=Femoston 2/10mg film-coated tablets |work=medicines.ie Ireland}}</ref>

All the metabolites of dydrogesterone retain the 4,6-diene-3-one structure, and are metabolically stable. As such, dydrogesterone does not undergo [[aromatisation]], which is consistent with its absence of estrogenic effects. Furthermore, dydrogesterone does not undergo 17α-[[hydroxylation]], which may contribute to its lack of androgenic effects.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The average terminal [[biological half-life|terminal half-lives]] of DHD and dydrogesterone vary between 14–17 and 5–7 hours, respectively.

===Elimination===
Dydrogesterone and its metabolites are excreted predominantly in [[urine]]. Total clearance of plasma is at a rate of 6.4 L/min. Within 72 hours, excretion is virtually complete. DHD is preponderantly present in the urine as a conjugate of [[glucuronic acid]]. Approximately 85% of the oral dose is successfully [[Egestion|egested]] from the body within 24 hours.

==Chemistry==
Although its molecular structure is almost identical to that of natural progesterone, its unique design makes it a potent, orally active progestogen.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ar.iiarjournals.org/content/24/3A/1433.full.pdf |title=Dydrogesterone (Duphaston®) and its 20-Dihydro-derivative as Selective Estrogen Enzyme Modulators in Human Breast Cancer Cell Lines. Effect on Sulfatase and on 17‚-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase (17‚-HSD) Activity |work=[[Anticancer Research]] }}</ref> In the dydrogesterone molecule, the [[hydrogen atom]] at [[Isotopes of carbon#Table|carbon 9]] is in the beta position and the [[methyl group]] at carbon 10 is in the alpha position - a reverse of the progesterone structure, hence the term 'retro' progesterone. Furthermore, it has a second [[double bond]] between carbon 6 and carbon 7 (the 4, 6-diene-3-one configuration). These small differences in chemical structure account for the improved oral activity, metabolic stability, and the lack of estrogenic, androgenic, [[glucocorticoid]], and [[mineralocorticoid]] properties of dydrogesterone.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/elsevier/use-of-dydrogesterone-as-a-progestogen-for-oral-contraception-PkM6Z5bHOJ |title=Use of Dydrogesterone as a progestogen for oral contraception |work=[[DeepDyve]][[ScienceDirect]] }}</ref>

Dydrogesterone is manufactured by treating progesterone with [[Ultraviolet|ultra-violet light]], leading to a change in the [[Three-dimensional space|spatial]] structure. It is produced from the plant [[steroid]]s, [[Dioscorea mexicana]], a plant of the [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]] family native to [[Mexico]]. Dioscorea contains a [[sterol]] called [[diosgenin]]. Diosgenin is converted to progesterone.<ref>{{cite book | authorlink = Howard J.A. Carp. | title = Recurrent Pregnancy Loss.

==History==
Dydrogesterone is a steroidal progestin that was first synthesized by Duphar in the 1950s and was first introduced to the market in 1961. It is unique, being the only retrosteroid that is commercially available and its molecular structure is closely related to that of natural progesterone,<ref>{{cite journal |title=Progestational effects of dydrogesterone in vitro, in vivo and on the human endometrium. | pmid=19969432 | doi=10.1016/j.maturitas.2009.10.011 |volume=65 Suppl 1 |date=Dec 2009 |pages=S3-11 |journal=Maturitas | last1 = Schindler | first1 = AE}}</ref> but it has enhanced oral [[bioavailability]].

It is estimated that during the period from 1977 to 2005<ref>{{cite journal|author=Queisser-Luft A|title=Dydrogesterone use during pregnancy: overview of birth defects reported since 1977.|date=3 February 2009|pmid=19193503|doi=10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2008.12.016|volume=85|journal=Early Hum Dev|pages=375–7}}</ref> around 38 million women were treated with dydrogesterone and that [[fetuses]] were exposed to dydrogesterone ''[[in utero]]'' in more than 10 million pregnancies. It has been approved in more than 100 countries worldwide.<ref name="Dydrogesterone review"/> It is commercially marketed under the brand name '''Duphaston''' and manufactured by [[Abbott Laboratories|Abbott]] after it took over [[Solvay (company)|Solvay Pharmaceuticals]].<ref name="What is Duphaston"/>

Dydrogesterone was first introduced, by Duphar, as Duphaston in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1961.<ref name="Publishing2013" /> Subsequently, it was introduced in the [[United States]] as Duphaston and Gynorest in 1962 and 1968, respectively.<ref name="Publishing2013" /> Duphaston was removed from the {{abbr|U.S.|United States}} market in 1979,<ref name="Freedman1986">{{cite book|author=Warren Freedman|title=International Products Liability|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k85WAAAAIAAJ|year=1986|publisher=Kluwer Law Book Publishers|isbn=978-0-930273-10-1|quote=Duphaston was removed from the market in 1979 or about two years after the FDA required the defendant to place warnings on the product.}}</ref> and Gynorest is also no longer available in the {{abbr|U.S.|United States}}.<ref name="FDA">{{cite web | url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.Set_Current_Drug&ApplNo=017388&DrugName=GYNOREST&ActiveIngred=DYDROGESTERONE&SponsorApplicant=SOLVAY&ProductMktStatus=3&goto=Search.DrugDetails}}</ref>
