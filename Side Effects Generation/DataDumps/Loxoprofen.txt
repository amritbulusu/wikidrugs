'''Loxoprofen''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) is a [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] (NSAID) in the [[propionic acid]] derivatives group, which also includes [[ibuprofen]] and [[naproxen]] among others. It is marketed in [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]] and [[Japan]] by [[Daiichi Sankyo|Sankyo]] as its [[sodium]] salt, '''loxoprofen sodium''', under the trade name '''Loxonin''', [[Argentina]] as '''Oxeno''' and in [[India]] as '''Loxomac'''. It is available in these countries for oral administration, and a [[transdermal patch|transdermal]] preparation was approved for sale in Japan on January 2006.<ref>{{cite press release | url = http://www.daiichisankyo.com/media_investors/media_relations/press_releases/detail/005643.html | title = Percutaneous Absorption-Type Analgesic and Anti-inflammatory Drug Loxonin Poultice 100mg Receives Approval for Manufacture | author = [[Daiichi Sankyo Co.]] | date = January 24, 2006 | accessdate = 2007-04-19 | publisher = Doctor's Guide Global Edition}}</ref>

==Pharmacokinetics==
Loxoprofen is a [[prodrug]]. It is quickly converted to its active ''trans''-alcohol [[metabolite]] following oral administration, and reaches its peak plasma concentration within 30 to 50 minutes.

==Mechanism of action==
As most [[NSAID]]s, loxoprofen is a non-selective [[cyclooxygenase]] inhibitor, and works by reducing the synthesis of [[prostaglandin]]s from [[arachidonic acid]].

==Interactions==
Loxoprofen should not be administered at the same time as second-generation [[quinolone antibiotic]]s such as [[ciprofloxacin]] and [[norfloxacin]], as it increases their inhibition of [[gamma-aminobutyric acid|GABA]] and this may cause [[seizure]]s.<ref name="Label">{{cite web | url = http://bulas.cxpass.net/index.asp?C=A&V=66506F737449443D36323834266163743D73686F7752656164436F6D6D656E7473<!--

It may also increase the plasma concentration of [[warfarin]], [[methotrexate]], [[sulfonylurea]] derivatives and [[lithium salt]]s, so care should be taken when loxoprofen is administered to patients taking any of these drugs.<ref name="Label"/>
