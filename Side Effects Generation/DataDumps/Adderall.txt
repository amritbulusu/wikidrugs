Adderall is generally well-tolerated and effective in treating the symptoms of ADHD and narcolepsy. At therapeutic doses, Adderall causes emotional and cognitive effects such as [[euphoria]], change in [[libido|desire for sex]], increased [[wakefulness]], and improved [[Executive functions|cognitive control]]. At these doses, it induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. In contrast, much larger doses of Adderall can impair cognitive control, cause [[Rhabdomyolysis|rapid muscle breakdown]], or induce a [[Stimulant psychosis#Amphetamines|psychosis]] (e.g., delusions and paranoia). The side effects of Adderall vary widely among individuals, but most commonly include [[insomnia]], [[dry mouth]], and [[loss of appetite]]. The risk of developing an [[addiction]] is insignificant when Adderall is used as prescribed at fairly low daily doses, such as those used for treating ADHD; however, the routine use of Adderall in larger daily doses poses a significant risk of addiction due to the pronounced [[reinforcement|reinforcing effects]] that are present at higher doses.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Howell|first=L|date=|title=Monoamine transporters and psychostimulant addiction|url=|journal=Biochemical Pharmacology|volume=75|pages=196–217}}</ref> Recreational doses of Adderall are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses, and carry a far greater risk of serious adverse effects.{{#tag:ref|<ref name="Libido" /><ref name="Adderall IR" /><ref name="Malenka_2009" /><ref name="Ergogenics" /><ref name="FDA Abuse & OD" /><ref name="FDA Effects" /><ref name="Cochrane" /><ref name="Stimulant Misuse" /><ref name="NHM-Addiction doses" /><ref name="Addiction risk" /><ref name="EncycOfPsychopharm" />|group="sources"}}

The two amphetamine enantiomers that compose Adderall (i.e., levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine) alleviate the symptoms of ADHD and narcolepsy by increasing the activity of the [[neurotransmitter]]s [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]] in the [[human brain|brain]], which results in part from their interactions with [[TAAR1|trace amine associated receptor 1]] (TAAR1) and [[vesicular monoamine transporter 2]] (VMAT2) in [[neuron]]s.  Dextroamphetamine is a more potent {{abbr|CNS|central nervous system}} stimulant than levoamphetamine, but levoamphetamine has slightly stronger cardiovascular and peripheral effects and a longer [[elimination half-life]] (i.e., it remains in the body longer) than dextroamphetamine. The levoamphetamine component of Adderall has been reported to improve the treatment response in some individuals relative to dextroamphetamine alone. Adderall's [[active ingredient]], amphetamine, shares many chemical and pharmacological properties with the human [[trace amine]]s, particularly [[phenethylamine]] and {{nowrap|[[N-methylphenethylamine|''N''-methylphenethylamine]]}}, the latter of which is a [[positional isomer]] of amphetamine.{{#tag:ref|<ref name="Malenka_2009_03" /><ref name="Miller" /><ref name="E Weihe" /><ref name="Trace Amines" /><ref name="Westfall" /><ref name="TAAR1 stereoselective" /><ref name="Child Psychiatry" /><ref name="Arnold" />|group="sources"}}

We stress that Zn<sup>2+</sup> per se did not affect basal efflux (Fig. 2 A).&nbsp;... In many brain regions, Zn<sup>2+</sup> is stored in synaptic vesicles and co-released together with glutamate; under basal conditions, the extracellular levels of Zn<sup>2+</sup> are low (∼10&nbsp;nM; see Refs. 39, 40).

The concentrations of Zn<sup>2+</sup> shown in this study, required for the stimulation of dopamine release (as well as inhibition of uptake), covered this physiologically relevant range, with maximum stimulation occurring at 3–30&nbsp;μM. It is therefore conceivable that the action of Zn<sup>2+</sup> on hDAT does not merely reflect a biochemical peculiarity but that it is physiologically relevant.&nbsp;...

===Comparison to other formulations===
Adderall is one of several formulations of pharmaceutical amphetamine, including singular or mixed enantiomers and as an enantiomer prodrug. The table below compares these medications (based on US approved forms):

===History===
The pharmaceutical company Rexar reformulated their popular weight loss drug [[Obetrol]] following its mandatory withdrawal from the market in 1973 under the [[Kefauver Harris Amendment]] to the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] due to the results of the [[Drug Efficacy Study Implementation|Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI)]] program (which indicated a lack of efficacy). The new formulation simply replaced the two methamphetamine components with dextroamphetamine and amphetamine components of the same weight (the other two original dextroamphetamine and amphetamine components were preserved), preserved the Obetrol branding, and despite it utterly lacking FDA approval, it still made it onto the market and was marketed and sold by Rexar for a number of years.

In 1994 Richwood Pharmaceuticals acquired Rexar and began promoting Obetrol as a treatment for ADHD (and later narcolepsy as well), now marketed under the new brand name of Adderall, a contraction of the phrase "A.D.D. for All" intended to convey that "it was meant to be kind of an inclusive thing" for marketing purposes.<ref name="Schwarz2013">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/health/the-selling-of-attention-deficit-disorder.html|title=The Selling of Attention Deficit Disorder|last=Schwarz|first=Alan|date=2013-12-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-22|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The FDA cited the company for numerous significant CGMP violations related to Obetrol discovered during routine inspections following the acquisition (including issuing a formal warning letter for the violations), then later issued a second formal warning letter to Richwood Pharmaceuticals specifically due to violations of "the new drug and misbranding provisions of the FD&C Act". Following extended discussions with Richwood Pharmaceuticals regarding the resolution of a large number of issues related to the company's numerous violations of FDA regulations, the FDA formally approved the first Obetrol labeling/sNDA revisions in 1996, including a name change to Adderall and a restoration of its status as an approved drug product.<ref name="fda-obetrol-adderall-collection">{{cite web|title=(Collection of internal FDA information pertaining to the topic of Obetrol/Adderall)|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/96/11522S010_Adderall.pdf|website=www.accessdata.fda.gov|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=27 April 2017}}</ref><ref name=HND>{{cite news|title=REGULATORY NEWS: Richwood's Adderall|url=http://www.elsevierbi.com/Publications/Health-News-Daily/1996/2/22/REGULATORY-NEWS-Richwoods-Adderall|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160523200531/http://www.elsevierbi.com/Publications/Health-News-Daily/1996/2/22/REGULATORY-NEWS-Richwoods-Adderall|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 May 2016|accessdate=29 May 2013|newspaper=Health News Daily|date=22 February 1996}}</ref> In 1997 Richwood Pharmaceuticals was acquired by Shire Pharmaceuticals in a $186 million transaction.<ref name="Schwarz2013" />
