=== Pregnancy ===
Levetiracetam is a Pregnancy Category C Drug. Studies in female pregnant rats have shown minor fetal skeletal abnormalities when given maximum recommended human doses of levetiracetam orally throughout pregnancy and lactation.<sup>[14]</sup>

=== Elderly ===
Studies were conducted to look for increased adverse effects in the elderly population as compared to younger patients. One such study published in Epilepsy Research showed no significant increase in incidence of adverse symptoms experienced by young or elderly patients with central nervous system (CNS) disorders.<sup>[16]</sup>

=== Children ===
Levetiracetam may be safely used with caution in children over the age of 4. However, it has not been determined whether it can be safely given to children under the age of 4.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://seizure.mgh.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/Advances-in-the-Treatment-of-Epilepsy.pdf| title= Advancements in the Treatment of Epilepsy| date= 1 January 2008| website= harvard.edu| accessdate= 8 July 2017}}</ref>

=== Kidney impairment ===
Kidney impairment decreases the rate of elimination of levetiracetam from the body. Individuals with reduced kidney function may require dose adjustments. Kidney function can be estimated from the rate of creatinine clearance.<ref name=":0" />

=== Liver impairment ===
Dose adjustment of levetiracetam is not necessary in liver impairment.<ref name=":0" />

== Adverse effects ==
The most common adverse effects of levetiracetam treatment include CNS effects such as somnolence, decreased energy, headache, dizziness, mood swings and coordination difficulties. These adverse effects are most pronounced in the first month of therapy. About 4% of patients dropped out of pre-approval clinical trials due to these side effects.<ref name=":0" />

About 13% of people taking levetiracetam experience adverse neuropsychiatric symptoms, which are usually mild. These include agitation, hostility, apathy, anxiety, emotional lability, and depression. Serious psychiatric adverse side effects that are reversed by drug discontinuation occur in about 1%. These include hallucinations, suicidal thoughts, or psychosis. These occurred mostly within the first month of therapy, but they could develop at any time during treatment.<ref name="pmid18728811">{{cite journal |doi=10.2147/NDT.S1655 |pmid=18728811 |pmc=2515905 |title=Monotherapy for partial epilepsy: Focus on levetiracetam |journal=Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=33–8 |year=2008 |last1=Gambardella |first1=Antonio }}</ref>

A study published in 2005 suggests that the addition of [[pyridoxine]] (vitamin B6) may reduce some of the psychiatric symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2005.460801_16.x |pmid=15987269 |title=Clinical Epilepsy: Pediatrics |journal=Epilepsia |volume=46 |pages=142–7 |year=2005 |author1=Naylor |first1=D. E. |last2=Wasterlain |first2=C. G. }}</ref>

Although rare, [[Stevens-Johnson syndrome]] (SJS) and [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]] (TEN), which appears as a painful spreading rash with redness and blistering and/or peeling skin, have been reported in patients treated with levetiracetam.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.seizure.2012.09.005 |pmid=23036769 |title=Stevens–Johnson syndrome induced by levetiracetam |journal=Seizure |volume=21 |issue=10 |pages=823–5 |year=2012 |last1=Zou |first1=Li-Ping |last2=Ding |first2=Chang-Hong |last3=Song |first3=Zhen-Jiang |last4=Li |first4=Xiao-Feng }}</ref> The incidence of SJS following exposure to anti-epileptics such as levetiracetam is about 1 in 3,000.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1528-1157.1998.tb01680.x |pmid=9798757 |title=Acute Management of Hypersensitivity Reactions and Seizures |journal=Epilepsia |volume=39 |pages=S17–21 |year=1998 |last1=Griebel |first1=May L. }}</ref>

Levetiracetam should not be used in people who have previously shown hypersensitivity to levetiracetam or any of the inactive ingredients in the tablet or oral solution. Such hypersensitivity reactions include, but are not limited to, unexplained rash with redness or blistered skin, difficulty breathing, and tightness in the chest or airways.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/021035s078s080,021505s021s024lbl.pdf |title=Keppra (levetiracetam) Prescribing Information |date= |accessdate= |website= |publisher= |last= |first=}}</ref>

=== Suicide ===
Levetiracetam, along with other anti-epileptic drugs, can increase the risk of suicide behavior or thoughts. People taking levetiracetam should be monitored closely for signs of worsening depression, suicidal thoughts or tendencies, or any altered emotional or behavioral states.<ref name=":1">{{cite web |title=DailyMed - KEPPRA- levetiracetam tablet |url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=fc0cbcd4-5400-4b71-a239-39e451b4c7b3 |website=dailymed.nlm.nih.gov |accessdate=2015-11-04}}</ref>

=== Drug interactions ===
No significant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between levetiracetam or its major metabolite and concomitant medications.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/j.1552-4604.2000.tb05984.x |pmid=10868309 |title=Absence of Pharmacokinetic Drug Interaction of Levetiracetam with Phenytoin in Patients with Epilepsy Determined by New Technique |journal=The Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume=40 |issue=6 |pages=590–5 |year=2000 |last1=Browne |first1=T.

== Mechanism of action ==
The exact mechanism by which levetiracetam acts to treat epilepsy is unknown. However, the drug binds to a synaptic vesicle glycoprotein, [[SV2A]],<ref name="Lynch">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lynch BA, Lambeng N, Nocka K, etal |title=The synaptic vesicle protein SV2A is the binding site for the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=101 |issue=26 |pages=9861–6 |date=June 2004 |pmid=15210974 |pmc=470764 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0308208101}}</ref> and inhibits presynaptic calcium channels<ref name="Vogl">{{cite journal |vauthors=Vogl C, Mochida S, Wolff C, etal |title=The Synaptic Vesicle Glycoprotein 2A Ligand Levetiracetam Inhibits Presynaptic Ca2+ Channels through an Intracellular Pathway |journal=Mol Pharmacol. |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=199–208 |date=August 2012 |doi=10.1124/mol.111.076687 |pmid=22554805}}</ref> reducing neurotransmitter release and acting as a neuromodulator.

== Pharmacokinetics ==

=== Absorption ===
The absorption of levetiracetam tablets and oral solution is rapid and essentially complete. The bioavailability of levetiracetam is close to 100 percent, and the effect of food on absorption is minor.<ref name=":0" />

=== Distribution ===
The volume of distribution of levetiracetam is similar to total body water. Levetiracetam modestly binds to plasma proteins (less than 10%).<ref name=":0" />

=== Metabolism ===
Levetiracetam does not undergo extensive metabolism, and the metabolites formed are not active and do not exert pharmacological activity. Metabolism of levetiracetam is not by liver cytochrome P450 enzymes, but through other metabolic pathways such as hydrolysis and hydroxylation.<ref name=":0" />

=== Excretion ===
Levetiracetam is eliminated from the body primarily by the kidneys with about 66 percent of the original drug passed unchanged into urine. The plasma half-life of levetiracetam in adults is about 6 to 8 hours.<ref name=":0" />

==Available forms==
Levetiracetam is available as regular and extended release oral formulations and as intravenous formulations.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sagentpharma.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Levetiracetam-Injection_PI.pdf |title=Levetiracetam Injection Prescribing Information |date= |accessdate= |website= |publisher= |last= |first=}}</ref>
