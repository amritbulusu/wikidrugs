'''Atorvastatin''', marketed under the trade name '''Lipitor''' among others,<ref name="LiptHome"/> is a member of the drug class known as [[statin]]s, which are used primarily as a [[lipid-lowering agent]] and for prevention of events associated with [[cardiovascular disease]]. Like all statins, atorvastatin works by inhibiting [[HMG-CoA reductase]], an [[enzyme]] found in [[liver]] tissue that plays a key role in production of cholesterol in the body.

Atorvastatin was first made in August 1985 at [[Warner-Lambert]]'s [[Parke-Davis]] research facility in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]<ref name="WSJ_blockbuster_2000">{{cite web | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB948677773420632448 | title = The Birth of a Blockbuster: Lipitor's Route out of the Lab | date = 24 January 2000 | work = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | accessdate = 24 November 2015 |author=Winslow, Ron |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan}}</ref> by a team led by [[Bruce Roth]].<ref name="Roth_2002">{{cite journal | vauthors = Roth BD | title = The discovery and development of atorvastatin, a potent novel hypolipidemic agent | journal = Progress in Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 40 | issue =  | pages = 1–22 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12516521 | doi = 10.1016/S0079-6468(08)70080-8 | isbn = 978-0-444-51054-9 | series = Progress in Medicinal Chemistry }}</ref><ref name="Roth_2002"/><ref name="Fortune_2003" /><ref name="Fortune_2003">{{cite web | url = http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2003/01/20/335643/index.htm | title = The $10 Billion Pill Hold the fries, please.

=== Interactions ===
Interactions with clofibrate, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, which are fibrates used in accessory therapy in many forms of [[hypercholesterolemia]], usually in combination with statins, increase the risk of [[myopathy]] and [[rhabdomyolysis]].<ref name="pmid8463436"/><ref name="pmid18158710"/><ref name="Graham2004"/>

Co-administration of atorvastatin with one of [[CYP3A4]] inhibitors such as [[itraconazole]],<ref name="pmid11061579"/> [[telithromycin]], and [[voriconazole]], may increase serum concentrations of atorvastatin, which may lead to adverse reactions. This is less likely to happen with other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as [[diltiazem]], [[erythromycin]], [[fluconazole]], [[ketoconazole]], [[clarithromycin]], [[cyclosporine]], [[Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitors]], or [[verapamil]],<ref name="pmid17178259"/> and only rarely with other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as [[amiodarone]] and [[aprepitant]].<ref name="pmid12036392" /> Often, [[bosentan]], [[fosphenytoin]], and [[phenytoin]], which are CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Only rarely, though, [[barbiturate]]s, [[carbamazepine]], [[efavirenz]], [[nevirapine]], [[oxcarbazepine]], [[rifampicin|rifampin]], and [[rifamycin]],<ref name="pmid16084850"/> which are also CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. [[Oral contraceptive]]s increased AUC values for [[norethisterone]] and [[ethinylestradiol]]; these increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.<ref name="AutoYG-7"/>

[[Antacid]]s can rarely decrease the plasma concentrations of statin drugs, but do not affect the [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL-C]]-lowering [[efficacy]].<ref name="pmid15901588">{{cite journal | vauthors = McKenney JM | title = Efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin in treatment of dyslipidemia | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | volume = 62 | issue = 10 | pages = 1033–47 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15901588 | doi =  }}</ref>

[[Niacin]] also is proved to increase the risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis.<ref name="pmid12036392" />

Co-administration of grapefruit juice with atorvastatin may cause an increase in [[Cmax (pharmacology)|C<sub>max</sub>]] and AUC, which can lead to adverse reactions or overdose toxicity.<ref name="Kane2000"/>

A few cases of myopathy have been reported when atorvastatin is given with [[colchicine]].<ref name="url_ atorvastatin_labeling.pfizer.com"/>

==Mechanism of action==
{{Main article|Statin}}

As with other statins, atorvastatin is a competitive [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] of [[HMG-CoA reductase]]. Unlike most others, however, it is a completely [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] compound. HMG-CoA reductase catalyzes the reduction of [[HMG-CoA reductase pathway|3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A]] (HMG-CoA) to [[mevalonate]], which is the [[Rate-determining step|rate-limiting step]] in hepatic [[cholesterol]] biosynthesis. Inhibition of the enzyme decreases ''[[de novo synthesis|de novo]]'' cholesterol synthesis, increasing expression of low-density lipoprotein receptors ([[LDL receptor]]s) on [[hepatocyte]]s. This increases LDL uptake by the hepatocytes, decreasing the amount of LDL-cholesterol in the blood. Like other statins, atorvastatin also reduces blood levels of [[triglyceride]]s and slightly increases levels of [[High density lipoprotein|HDL-cholesterol]].

Recent studies have shown that in patients suffering from [[acute coronary syndrome]], high-dose statin treatment may play a plaque-stabilizing role.  At high doses, statins have anti-inflammatory effects, incite reduction of the necrotic plaque core, and improve endothelial function, leading to plaque stabilization and, sometimes, plaque regression.  However, there is an increased risk of statin-associated adverse effects with such high-dose statin treatment.<ref name="Rosa 501–15"/> There is a similar thought process and risks associated with using high-dose statins to prevent recurrence of [[thrombotic stroke]].<ref name="Furie 1994–5"/>

==Pharmacodynamics==
The liver is the primary site of action of atorvastatin, as this is the principal site of both cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance.  It is the dosage of atorvastatin, rather than systemic drug concentration, which correlates with extent of LDL-C reduction.<ref name="url_ atorvastatin_labeling.pfizer.com"/>

==Pharmacokinetics==

===Absorption===
Atorvastatin undergoes rapid absorption when taken orally, with an approximate time to maximum plasma concentration ([[Transport maximum|T<sub>max</sub>]]) of 1–2 h. The absolute [[bioavailability]] of the drug is about 14%, but the systemic availability for [[HMG-CoA reductase]] activity is approximately 30%. Atorvastatin undergoes high intestinal clearance and [[first-pass metabolism]], which is the main cause for the low systemic availability. Administration of atorvastatin with food produces a 25% reduction in [[Cmax (pharmacology)|C<sub>max</sub>]] (rate of absorption) and a 9% reduction in [[Area_under_the_curve_(pharmacokinetics)|AUC]] (extent of absorption), although food does not affect the plasma [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL-C]]-lowering [[efficacy]] of atorvastatin. Evening dose administration is known to reduce the C<sub>max</sub> and AUC by 30% each. However, time of administration does not affect the plasma LDL-C-lowering efficacy of atorvastatin.

===Distribution===
The mean [[volume of distribution]] of atorvastatin is approximately 381 L.  It is highly protein bound (≥98%), and studies have shown it is likely secreted into human breastmilk.

===Metabolism===
Atorvastatin [[metabolism]] is primarily through [[cytochrome P450]] [[CYP3A4|3A4]] [[hydroxylation]] to form active ortho- and parahydroxylated [[metabolites]], as well as various [[beta-oxidation]] metabolites. The ortho- and parahydroxylated metabolites are responsible for 70% of systemic [[HMG-CoA reductase]] activity. The ortho-hydroxy metabolite undergoes further metabolism via [[glucuronidation]]. As a substrate for the CYP3A4 isozyme, it has shown susceptibility to inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 to produce increased or decreased plasma concentrations, respectively. This interaction was tested ''in vitro'' with concurrent administration of [[erythromycin]], a known CYP3A4 isozyme inhibitor, which resulted in increased plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. It is also an inhibitor of cytochrome 3A4.

===Excretion===
Atorvastatin is primarily eliminated via [[hepatic]] [[biliary]] excretion, with less than 2% recovered in the [[urine]]. [[Bile]] elimination follows hepatic and/or extrahepatic metabolism. There does not appear to be any [[enterohepatic circulation|entero-hepatic recirculation]]. Atorvastatin has an approximate elimination [[half-life]] of 14 h. Noteworthy, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity appears to have a half-life of 20–30 h, which is thought to be due to the active metabolites. Atorvastatin is also a substrate of the intestinal [[P-glycoprotein]] efflux transporter, which pumps the drug back into the intestinal lumen during drug absorption.<ref name="pmid12036392"/>

In [[liver failure|hepatic insufficiency]], plasma drug concentrations are significantly affected by concurrent liver disease. Patients with A-stage liver disease show a four-fold increase in both C<sub>max</sub> and AUC. Patients with B-stage liver disease show a 16-fold increase in C<sub>max</sub> and an 11-fold increase in AUC.

[[Geriatrics|Geriatric]] patients (>65 years old) exhibit altered pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin compared to young adults, with mean AUC and C<sub>max</sub> values that are 40% and 30% higher, respectively. Additionally, healthy elderly patients show a greater pharmacodynamic response to atorvastatin at any dose; therefore, this population may have lower effective doses.<ref name="uspi_lipitor.pdf"/>

==Pharmacogenetics==
Several genetic [[genetic polymorphism|polymorphisms]] have been found to be associated with a higher incidence of undesirable side effects of atorvastatin. This phenomenon is suspected to be related to increased plasma levels of pharmacologically active metabolites, such as atorvastatin lactone and p-hydroxyatorvastatin. Atorvastatin and its active metabolites may be monitored in potentially susceptible patients using specific chromatographic techniques.<ref name="pmid22368281"/>

The final commercial production of atorvastatin relied on a [[chiral pool]] approach, where the stereochemistry of the first alcohol functional group was carried into the synthesis—through the choice of [[erythorbic acid|isoascorbic acid]], an inexpensive and easily sourced plant-derived natural product.<ref name=Roth_2002/><ref>{{cite book |author = Jie Jack Li |author2 = Douglas S.

==History==
Bruce Roth, who was hired by Warner-Lambert as a chemist in 1982, had synthesized an "experimental compound" codenamed CI 981 – later called atorvastatin.<ref name="Fortune_2003" /><ref name="FT_nov_2009">{{cite web | url=https://www.ft.com/content/d0f7af5c-d7e6-11de-b578-00144feabdc0 | title=The fall of the world’s best-selling drug | work=Financial Times | date=28 November 2009 | accessdate=24 November 2015 | author=Jack, Andrew}}</ref>  Warner-Lambert management was concerned that atorvastatin was a me-too version of rival [[Merck & Co.]]'s [[orphan drug]] lovastatin (brand name [[Mevacor]]). Mevacor, which was first marketed in 1987, was the industry's first statin and Merck's synthetic version – [[simvastatin]] – was in the advanced stages of development.<ref name="FT_nov_2009" /> Nevertheless, Bruce Roth and his bosses, Roger Newton and Ronald Cresswell, in 1985 convinced company executives to move the compound into expensive clinical trials. Early results comparing atorvastatin vs. simvastatin demonstrated that atorvastatin was significantly more potent and displayed fewer side effects.<ref name="FT_nov_2009" />

In 1994 the findings of a Merck-funded study were published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' concluding the efficacy of statins in lowering cholesterol in 4444 Scandinavian patients proving for the first time not only that a "statin reduced 'bad' LDL cholesterol but also that it led to a sharp drop in fatal heart attacks among patients with heart disease."<ref name="FT_nov_2009" /><ref name="Lancet_1994_scandinavia">{{cite journal | title=Randomised trial of cholesterol lowering in 4444 patients with coronary heart disease: the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) | journal=Lancet | date=19 November 1994 |volume=344 |issue=8934 | pages=1383–9 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(94)90566-5 | pmid=7968073}}</ref>
In 1996 Warner-Lambert entered into a co-marketing agreement with Pfizer to sell Lipitor and in 2000 Pfizer acquired Warner-Lambert 2000 for $90.2 billion.<ref name="WSJ_blockbuster_2000" /><ref name="Roth_2002" /><ref name = "US4681893" /><ref name="History_Parke-Davis" /> Lipitor was on the market by 1996.<ref name="NYT_2000" /><ref name="FDA_Lipitor">{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.DrugDetails |title=www.accessdata.fda.gov |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> By 2003 Lipitor had become the best selling pharmaceutical in the United States.<ref name="Fortune_2003" /> From 1996 to 2012 under the trade name Lipitor, atorvastatin became the world's best-selling drug of all time, with more than $125 billion in sales over approximately 14.5 years.<ref name="Crain_2011" /> Lipitor alone "provided up to a quarter of Pfizer Inc.'s annual revenue for years."<ref name="Crain_2011"/>

==Generic availability==

Pfizer's U.S. patent on Lipitor expired on 30 November 2011.<ref name="CNN Wire Staff"/> Initially, generic atorvastatin was manufactured only by [[Actavis|Watson Pharmaceuticals]] and India's [[Ranbaxy Laboratories]]. Prices for the generic version did not drop to the level of other generics—$10 or less for a month's supply—until other manufacturers began to supply the drug in May 2012.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nelm.nhs.uk/en/NeLM-Area/News/2012---May/30/June-Drug-Tariff-Reduced-prices-for-atorvastatin/ | date = June 2012 | title = Price to UK for 28 tablets from £3.25 (10mg) to £10.00 (80mg) | publisher = [[National Health Service]]  }}</ref>

In other countries, atorvastatin calcium is made in tablet form by generic drug makers under various brand names including Stator, Atorvastatin Teva, Litorva, Torid, Atoris, Atorlip, Mactor, Lipvas, Sortis, Torvast, Torvacard, Totalip, and Tulip.<ref name="Pfizer 2008 Annual Report" /> Pfizer also makes its own generic version under the name Zarator.<ref>{{cite news |first= Lisa |last= Rapley |date= 31 May 2012 |title= Atorvastatin sole funding announced |url= http://www.pharmacytoday.co.nz/news/2012/may-2012/31/atorvastatin-sole-funding-announced.aspx |publisher= PharmacyToday.co.nz |accessdate= 16 July 2014}}</ref>

==Drug recalls==
On 9 November 2012, Indian drugmaker [[Ranbaxy Laboratories]] Ltd. voluntarily recalled 10-, 20- and 40-mg doses of its generic version of atorvastatin in the United States.<ref>
