'''Hamycin''' is a [[polyene antimycotic]] [[organic compound]] described in [[India]].<ref>[http://gateway.nlm.nih.gov/MeetingAbstracts/102214424.html Aggregation behaviour of hamycin and its interaction with membrane sterols]</ref>  It is a heptaene [[Antifungal medication|antifungal]] compound rather similar in [[chemical structure]] to [[amphotericin B]] except that it has an additional [[aromatic]] [[Functional group|group]] bonded to the molecule.  When pure, hamycin is a yellow, powdered [[solid]].  There are two versions of hamycin with very similar [[chemical structure]]s: Hamycin A and Hamycin B.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc= 352743 | pmid=393163 | volume=15 | title=Classification of polyene antibiotics according to chemical structure and biological effects | journal=Antimicrob Agents Chemother | pages=716â€“22 | last1 = Kotler-Brajtburg | first1 = J | last2 = Medoff | first2 = G | last3 = Kobayashi | first3 = GS | last4 = Boggs | first4 = S | last5 = Schlessinger | first5 = D | last6 = Pandey | first6 = RC | last7 = Rinehart | first7 = KL Jr | doi=10.1128/aac.15.5.716}}</ref>
