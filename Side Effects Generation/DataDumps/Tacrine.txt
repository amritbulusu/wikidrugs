'''Tacrine''' is a centrally acting [[anticholinesterase]] and indirect [[cholinergic]] agonist ([[parasympathomimetic]]). It was the first centrally acting cholinesterase inhibitor approved for the treatment of [[Alzheimer's disease]], and was marketed under the trade name '''Cognex'''. Tacrine was first synthesised by [[Adrien Albert]] at the [[University of Sydney]]. It also acts as a [[histamine N-methyltransferase]] inhibitor.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Taraschenko|first=OD|author2=Barnes, WG |author3=Herrick-Davis, K |author4=Yokoyama, Y |author5=Boyd, DL |author6= Hough, LB |title=Actions of tacrine and galanthamine on histamine-N-methyltransferase.|journal=Methods and findings in experimental and clinical pharmacology|date=April 2005|volume=27|issue=3|pages=161–165|pmid=15834447|doi=10.1358/mf.2005.27.3.890872}}</ref>

==Clinical use==
Tacrine was the prototypical [[cholinesterase inhibitor]] for the treatment of [[Alzheimer's disease]]. [[William K. Summers]] received a patent for this use (US Patent No. 4,816,456).<ref>{US Patent No. 4,816,456} http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=4,816,456.PN.&OS=PN/4,816,456&RS=PN/4,816,456</ref><ref>Waldholz M.

Tacrine has been discontinued in the [[United States of America|US]]<ref name=MSR>{{cite web|title=tacrine (Discontinued) - Cognex|url=http://reference.medscape.com/drug/tacrine-343070|work=Medscape Reference|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=8 October 2013}}</ref> in 2013, due to concerns over safety.<ref>[http://www.livertox.nih.gov/Tacrine.htm Tacrine] at LiverTox</ref>

Tacrine was also described as an [[analeptic]] agent used to promote mental alertness.<ref name="ElksGanellin1990">{{cite journal|last1=Elks|first1=J.|last2=Ganellin|first2=C. R.|year=1990|doi=10.1007/978-1-4757-2085-3}}</ref>

==Adverse Effects==
;Very Common (>10% incidence) adverse effects include<ref name = MSR />
* Increased [[Liver function tests|LFTs]]
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Dizziness

;Common (1-10% incidence) adverse effects include<ref name = MSR /><ref name = DD />
* Indigestion
* Belching
* Abdominal pain
* Myalgia — muscle pain
* Confusion
* Ataxia — decreased control over bodily movements.
* Insomnia
* Rhinitis
* Rash
* Fatigue
* Weight loss
* Constipation
* Somnolence
* Tremor
* Anxiety
* Urinary incontinence
* Hallucinatons
* Agitation
* [[Conjunctivitis]] (a link to tacrine treatment has not been conclusively proven)
* Diaphoresis — sweating.

;Uncommon/Rare (<1% incidence) adverse effects include<ref name = DD />
* Hepatotoxicity (''that is'' toxic effects on the liver)
* Ototoxicity (hearing/ear damage; a link to tacrine treatment has not been conclusively proven)
* Seizures
* [[Agranulocytosis]] (a link between treatment and this adverse effect has not been proven) — a potentially fatal drop in white blood cells, the body's immune/defensive cells. 
* Taste changes

;Unknown incidence adverse effects include<ref name = DD />
* [[Urinary tract infection]]
* Delirium
* Other optic effects such as [[glaucoma]], [[cataracts]], etc. (also not conclusively linked to tacrine treatment)
* Depression
* Suicidal ideation and behaviour
* Hypotension
* Bradycardia

=== Overdose ===
As stated above, overdosage of tacrine may give rise to severe side effects such as nausea, vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and convulsions. [[Atropine]] is a popular treatment for overdose.<ref name = DD />

==Pharmacokinetics==
Major form of metabolism is in the liver via hydroxylation of benzylic carbon by [[CYP1A2]].  This forms the major metabolite [[1-hydroxy-tacrine]] (velnacrine) which is still active.<ref name = DD>Truven Health Analytics, Inc. DRUGDEX® System (Internet) [cited 2013 Oct 8]. Greenwood Village, CO: Thomsen Healthcare; 2013.</ref>
