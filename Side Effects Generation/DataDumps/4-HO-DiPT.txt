'''4-Hydroxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine''' ('''4-HO-DiPT''' or '''Iprocin''') is a synthetic [[psychedelic drug]]. It is a higher [[Homology (chemistry)|homologue]] of [[psilocin]], [[4-HO-DET]], and is a positional isomer of [[4-HO-DPT]] and has a [[tryptamine]] molecular sub-structure.

==Dosage==
4-HO-DiPT is orally active at around 3 mg and above, and its effects last for 2-3 hours.<ref name="Erowid.org 4-HO-DiPT Dosage Vault">[https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/4_ho_dipt/4_ho_dipt_dose.shtml Erowid.org 4-HO-DiPT Dosage Vault]</ref> Higher doses such as those above 30 mgs can increase the duration of the effects significantly.

==Effects==
The effects of 4-HO-DiPT are broadly comparable to those of other serotonergic psychedelics such as [[LSD]] and [[psilocybin]], but they are distinguished by their relative brevity. [[Alexander Shulgin|Shulgin]] "doubt[s] that there is another psychedelic drug, anywhere, that can match this one for speed, for intensity, for brevity, and sensitive to dose, at least one that is active orally." An idiosyncratic effect of the drug, also noted by Shulgin, is its tendency to induce tremors.<ref>{{CiteTiHKAL}}</ref><ref>[https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/4_ho_dipt/4_ho_dipt.shtml Entry at Erowid]</ref><ref>[https://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal17.shtml Tihkal 4-HO-DIPT entry]</ref>

Some users have reported a minor audio distortion with lower dosages. Higher dosages increase the polarity of the distortion. It is defined as being slightly lower in pitch and creating several different effects, such as pitch bend, volume distortion, and rate distortion. As with most [[DiPT]] psychedelics, music can become more dissonant and less harmonious. Users have also reported a visual distortion widely comparable to the hallucinogen [[LSD]].

==Legal Status==
===Sweden===
[[Riksdag|''Sveriges riksdags'']] health ministry [[:sv:Statens folkhälsoinstitut|''Statens folkhälsoinstitut'']] classified 4-HO-DiPT as "health hazard" under the act [[:sv:Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor|''Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor'']] (translated ''Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health'') as of Mar 1, 2005,  in their regulation '''SFS 2005:26''' listed as '''4-hydroxi-N,N-diisopropyltryptamin (4-HO-DIPT)''', making it illegal to sell or possess.<ref>http://www.notisum.se/rnp/sls/sfs/20050026.pdf</ref>

===United States===
4-HO-DiPT is not scheduled at the federal level in the [[United States]],<ref name="PART 1308 — SCHEDULES OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES - 1308.11 Schedule I">[http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1308/1308_11.htm 21 CFR — SCHEDULES OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES §1308.11 Schedule I.]</ref> but it is possible that it could be considered an analog of [[5-MeO-DiPT]], in which case purchase, sale, or possession could be prosecuted under the [[Federal Analog Act]].

====Florida====
"4-Hydroxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine" is a Schedule I [[controlled substance]] in the state of [[Florida]] making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess in Florida.<ref name="Florida Statutes - Chapter 893 - DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION AND CONTROL">[http://leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0800-0899/0893/0893.html Florida Statutes - Chapter 893 - DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION AND CONTROL]</ref>
