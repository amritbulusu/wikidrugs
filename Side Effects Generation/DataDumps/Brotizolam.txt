Brotizolam is not approved for sale in the UK, United States or Canada. It is approved for sale in the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria, Portugal, Israel, Italy, Taiwan and Japan.

==Indications==
'''Insomnia.''' Brotizolam is prescribed for the short-term treatment, 2–4 weeks only of [[Insomnia#Benzodiazepines|severe or debilitating insomnia]]. Insomnia can be described as a difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakening, early awakenings or a combination of each. Brotizolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine and is sometimes used in patients who have difficulty in maintaining sleep or getting to sleep. Hypnotics should only be used on a short-term basis or in those with chronic insomnia on an occasional basis.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rickels |first1=K. |title=The clinical use of hypnotics: indications for use and the need for a variety of hypnotics |journal=Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica |volume=74 |pages=132–41 |year=1986 |pmid=2883820 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.1986.tb08990.x}}</ref>

'''Premedication.''' Brotizolam, in a dose of 0.25&nbsp;mg can be used as a premedication prior to surgery, this dose was found to be comparable in efficacy to 2&nbsp;mg [[flunitrazepam]] as a premedicant prior to surgery.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nishiyama |first1=Tomoki |last2=Yamashita |first2=Koichi |last3=Yokoyama |first3=Takeshi |last4=Imoto |first4=Akinobu |last5=Manabe |first5=Masanobu |title=Effects of quazepam as a preoperative night hypnotic: comparison with brotizolam |journal=Journal of Anesthesia |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=7–12 |year=2007 |pmid=17285406 |doi=10.1007/s00540-006-0445-2}}</ref>

==Side effects==
Common side effects of brotizolam are typical of hypnotic benzodiazepines and are related to [[Central nervous system|CNS depression]], and include [[somnolence]], [[ataxia]], [[headache]], [[anterograde amnesia]], [[dizziness]], [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], impairment of motor functions, slurred speech, [[confusion]], and [[Accident-proneness|clumsiness]].

Less common side effects include [[hypotension]], [[respiratory depression]], hallucinations, nausea and vomiting, [[palpitation]]s, and paradoxical reactions (i.e. aggression, anxiety, violent behavior, etc.).

Brotizolam can cause residual side effects the next day such as impaired cognitive and motor functions as well as drowsiness. Disruption of sleep patterns may also occur such as suppression of [[REM sleep]]. These side effects are more likely at higher doses (above 0.5–1&nbsp;mg).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nicholson |first1=AN |last2=Stone |first2=BM |last3=Pascoe |first3=PA |title=Studies on sleep and performance with a triazolo-1, 4-thienodiazepine (brotizolam) |journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=75–81 |year=1980 |pmid=7397057 |pmc=1430017 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.1980.tb00504.x}}</ref>

In clinical trials brotizolam 0.125 to 0.5&nbsp;mg improved sleep in insomniacs similarly to [[nitrazepam]] 2.5 and 5&nbsp;mg, [[flunitrazepam]] 2&nbsp;mg and [[triazolam]] 0.25&nbsp;mg, whilst brotizolam 0.5&nbsp;mg was shown to be superior to [[flurazepam]] 30&nbsp;mg, but inferior to [[temazepam]] 30&nbsp;mg in some studies. Brotizolam at dosages below 0.5&nbsp;mg at night usually produced minimal morning drowsiness; no residual impairment of psychomotor performance occurs following dosages within the recommended range of 0.125 to 0.25&nbsp;mg. No serious side effects have been reported to date and the most frequently observed adverse experiences are drowsiness, headache and dizziness. Mild rebound insomnia may occur in some patients when treatment is stopped.<ref name="pmid3281819"/>

==Contraindications and special caution==
Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with [[comorbid]] [[psychiatric disorders]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Authier |first1=N. |last2=Balayssac |first2=D. |last3=Sautereau |first3=M. |last4=Zangarelli |first4=A. |last5=Courty |first5=P. |last6=Somogyi |first6=A.A. |last7=Vennat |first7=B. |last8=Llorca |first8=P.-M. |last9=Eschalier |first9=A. |trans_title=Benzodiazepine dependence: Focus on withdrawal syndrome |title=Dépendance aux benzodiazépines : le syndrome de sevrage |language=French |journal=Annales Pharmaceutiques Françaises |volume=67 |issue=6 |pages=408–13 |year=2009 |pmid=19900604 |doi=10.1016/j.pharma.2009.07.001 |url=http://www.masson.fr/masson/S0003-4509(09)00138-2 }}</ref>

==Pharmacology==
Brotizolam has been shown in animal studies to be a very high potency benzodiazepine, and it may be the most potent benzodiazepine used on humans.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Although further studies need to be done to confirm this.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Shibuya |first1=Takeshi |last2=Field |first2=Richard |last3=Watanabe |first3=Yasuo |last4=Sato |first4=Katsuhiko |last5=Salafsky |first5=Bernard |title=Structure-affinity relationships between several new benzodiazepine derivatives and 3H-diazepam receptor sites |journal= Japanese Journal of Pharmacology |volume=34 |pages=435–40 |year=1984 |doi=10.1254/jjp.34.435 |pmid=6144807 |issue=4}}</ref> The [[elimination half-life]] of brotizolam is 3–6 hours. It is absorbed rapidly after administration; after administration it is metabolised into active metabolites, one of which is far less potent than brotizolam and the other is only present in very small amounts in the blood and thus the [[metabolites]] of brotizolam do not have any pharmacological effect in humans.<ref name=pmid6140948/> Brotizolam induces impairment of motor function and has hypnotic properties.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yasui |first1=M |last2=Kato |first2=A |last3=Kanemasa |first3=T |last4=Murata |first4=S |last5=Nishitomi |first5=K |last6=Koike |first6=K |last7=Tai |first7=N |last8=Shinohara |first8=S |last9=Tokomura |first9=M |title=Pharmacological profiles of benzodiazepinergic hypnotics and correlations with receptor subtypes |journal=Nihon shinkei seishin yakurigaku zasshi |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=143–51 |year=2005 |pmid=16045197 }}</ref>

Brotizolam increases the slow wave light sleep (SWLS) in a dose-dependent manner whilst suppressing deep sleep stages. Less time is spent in stages 3 and 4 which are the deep sleep stages when benzodiazepines such as brotizolam are used. Benzodiazepines are therefore not good hypnotics in the treatment of insomnia. The suppression of deep sleep stages by benzodiazepines may be especially problematic to the elderly as they naturally spend less time in the deep sleep stage.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Noguchi |first1=Hideaki |last2=Kitazumi |first2=Kazuhiro |last3=Mori |first3=Megumi |last4=Shiba |first4=Toshiharu |title=Electroencephalographic Properties of Zaleplon, a Non-Benzodiazepine Sedative/Hypnotic, in Rats |journal=Journal of Pharmacological Sciences |volume=94 |issue=3 |pages=246–51 |year=2004 |pmid=15037809 |doi=10.1254/jphs.94.246}}</ref>

==Abuse==
{{See also|Benzodiazepine drug misuse}}

Brotizolam is a drug with a potential for abuse. Drug misuse is defined as taking the drug to achieve a 'high', or continuing to take the drug in the long term against medical advice.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Griffiths |first1=RR |last2=Johnson |first2=MW |title=Relative abuse liability of hypnotic drugs: a conceptual framework and algorithm for differentiating among compounds |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=66 |issue=Suppl 9 |pages=31–41 |year=2005 |pmid=16336040}}</ref>

Abuse of brotizolam, although not widespread, was a problem in [[Hong Kong]] back in the late 1980s and 1990s. To control benzodiazepine abuse in Hong Kong, the Government's Pharmacy and Poisons Board reclassified benzodiazepines as Dangerous Drugs in October 1990. Apart from formal prescriptions, detailed records were then required for the supply and dispensing of these drugs. These regulations were applied initially only to brotizolam, [[triazolam]] and [[flunitrazepam]] as they were the major benzodiazepines of abuse. The impact of these regulatory changes on benzodiazepine use has been studied by analyzing the sales patterns of seven benzodiazepines between 1990–1993. In 1991, the sales of flunitrazepam and triazolam fell, but the sales of five unrestricted benzodiazepines increased.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=KK |last2=Chan |first2=TY |last3=Chan |first3=AW |last4=Lau |first4=GS |last5=Critchley |first5=JA |title=Use and abuse of benzodiazepines in Hong Kong 1990-1993--the impact of regulatory changes |journal=Journal of toxicology. Clinical toxicology |volume=33 |issue=6 |pages=597–602 |year=1995 |pmid=8523479 |doi=10.3109/15563659509010615}}</ref> Particular problems arose with the trafficking and abuse of [[nimetazepam]] and the abuse of [[temazepam]] within that same year in 1991. The regulations that were originally only applied to brotizolam, triazolam and flunitrazepam were now being extended to include all benzodiazepines by January 1992. A regulation requiring the use of proper prescriptions and detailed records for the supply and dispensing of benzodiazepines, appears to have curbed, at least partially, their abuse in Hong Kong. There is still some problems with [[temazepam]], [[nimetazepam]], [[triazolam]], and brotizolam but it is not major.
