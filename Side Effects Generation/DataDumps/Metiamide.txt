'''Metiamide''' is a histamine [[H2 antagonist|H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonist]] developed from another H<sub>2</sub> antagonist, [[burimamide]].<ref name="Clayden">{{Clayden|pages=204–206, 586-588}}</ref> It was an intermediate compound in the development of the successful anti-ulcer drug [[cimetidine]] (Tagamet).<ref name="ACS Landmarks">{{cite web|url=http://portal.acs.org/portal/PublicWebSite/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/cimetidinetagamet/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121209003707/http://portal.acs.org/portal/PublicWebSite/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/cimetidinetagamet/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 9, 2012 |title=Tagamet<sup>®</sup>: Discovery of Histamine H<sub>2</sub>-receptor Antagonists |publisher=American Chemical Society |work=National Historic Chemical Landmarks |accessdate=June 25, 2012 }}</ref>

==Development of metiamide from burimamide==
After discovering that [[burimamide]] is largely inactive at physiological pH, due to the presence of its [[electron]]-donating [[side chain]], the following steps were undertaken to stabilize burimamide:

* addition of a [[thioether|sulfide]] group close to the [[imidazole]] ring, giving thiaburimamide
* addition of [[methyl]] group to the 4-position on the [[imidazole]] ring to favor the [[tautomer]] of thiaburimamide which binds better to the H<sub>2</sub> receptor

These changes increased the [[bioavailability]] metiamide so that it is ten times more potent than [[burimamide]] in inhibiting histamine-stimulated release of [[gastric acid]].<ref name="ACS Landmarks"/> The clinical trials that began in 1973 demonstrated the ability of metiamide to provide symptomatic relief for ulcerous patients by increasing healing rate of [[peptic ulcers]]. However, during these trials, an unacceptable number of patients dosed with metiamide developed [[agranulocytosis]] (decreased white blood cell count).<ref name="ACS Landmarks"/>

==Modification of metiamide to cimetidine==
It was determined that the [[thiourea]] group was the cause of the [[agranulocytosis]]. Therefore, replacement of the [[thiocarbonyl]] in the [[thiourea]] group was suggested:

* with [[urea]] or [[guanidine]] resulted in a compound with much less activity (only 5% of the potency of metiamide)
* however, the NH form (the guanidine analog of metiamide) did not show [[agonist]]ic effects
* to prevent the guanidine group being protonated at physiological pH, electron-withdrawing groups were added
* adding a [[nitrile]] or [[nitro group]] prevented the guanidine group from being protonated and did not cause [[agranulocytosis]]

The nitro and cyano groups are sufficiently [[electronegative]] to reduce the [[Acid dissociation constant|pK<sub>a</sub>]] of the neighboring [[nitrogen]]s to the same [[acidity]] of the thiourea group, hence preserving the activity of the drug in a physiological environment.

==Synthesis==

Reacting ethyl 2-chloroacetoacetate ('''1''') with 2 [[molar equivalent]]s of [[formamide]] ('''2''') gives 4-carboethoxy-5-methylimidazole ('''3'''). Reduction of the carboxylic ester ('''3''') with sodium in liquid ammonia via [[Birch reduction]] gives the corresponding alcohol ('''4'''). Reaction of that with [[cysteamine]] (mercaptoethylamine), as its hydrochloride, leads to intermediate '''5'''. In the strongly acid medium, the amine is completely protonated; this allows the [[thiol]] to express its [[nucleophilicity]] without competition and the acid also activates the alcoholic function toward displacement. Finally, condensation of the amine with [[methyl isothiocyanate]] gives metiamide ('''6''').
