===Pregnancy===
Clonidine is classed by the FDA as pregnancy category C. It is classified by the TGA of Australia as pregnancy category B3, which means that it has shown some detrimental effects on fetal development in animal studies, although the relevance of this to human beings is unknown.<ref name = TGA/> Clonidine can pass into breast milk and may harm a nursing baby; caution is warranted in women who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://drugsdb.eu/drug.php?d=Clonidine&m=Physicians%20Total%20Care,%20Inc.&id=b65742b7-5db5-41cf-bf69-41700cdd2c59.xml | title = Clonidine | work = Prescription Marketed Drugs | publisher = www.drugsdb.eu }}</ref>

===Withdrawal===
Clonidine suppresses sympathetic outflow resulting in lower blood pressure, but sudden discontinuation can cause rebound hypertension due to a rebound in sympathetic outflow.<ref name = MD>{{cite web|title=Clonidine|work=Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference|publisher=Pharmaceutical Press|date=13 January 2014|accessdate=28 June 2014|url=http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/martindale/current/ms-11308-l.htm|editor=Brayfield, A|location=London, UK}}</ref>

Clonidine therapy should generally be gradually tapered when discontinuing therapy to avoid [[rebound effects]] from occurring. Treatment of clonidine withdrawal hypertension depends on the severity of the condition. Reintroduction of clonidine for mild cases,  alpha and beta blockers for more urgent situations. Beta blockers never should be used alone to treat clonidine withdrawal as alpha vasoconstriction would still continue.<ref name="isbn0-07-142280-3">{{cite book |author1=Parker, K |author2=Brunton, L |author3=Goodman, LS |author4=Lazo, JS |author5=Gilman, A | title = Goodman & Gilman's - the pharmacological basis of therapeutics | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | year = 2006 | pages = 854–855 | isbn = 0-07-142280-3 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Vitiello, B. | title = Understanding the Risk of Using Medications for ADHD with Respect to Physical Growth and Cardiovascular Function | journal = Child Adolesc Psychiatr Clin N Am | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages= 459–474, xi | year = 2008 | pmid = 18295156 | pmc = 2408826 | doi = 10.1016/j.chc.2007.11.010 }}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Clonidine treats high blood pressure by stimulating [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>2</sub> receptors]] in the brain, which decreases [[peripheral vascular resistance]], lowering blood pressure. It has specificity towards the [[presynaptic]] α<sub>2</sub> receptors in the [[vasomotor center]] in the [[brainstem]]. This binding decreases presynaptic [[calcium]] levels, thus inhibiting the release of [[norepinephrine]] (NE).
