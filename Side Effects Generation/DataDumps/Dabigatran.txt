'''Dabigatran''', sold under the brand name '''Pradaxa''' among others, is an [[anticoagulant medication]] which can be taken by mouth. It is used as an alternative to [[warfarin]], since it does not have to be monitored by blood tests, but offers similar results in terms of efficacy.

It is a [[direct thrombin inhibitor]], and functions by directly inhibiting both free and fibrin-bound thrombin.

Dabigatran is considered a "reversible" anticoagulant medication. There is a specific antidote, [[idarucizumab]], which reverses the effect of dabigatran. A study sponsored by the manufacturer found that idarucizumab effectively reversed anticoagulation by dabigatran within minutes.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Idarucizumab for Dabigatran Reversal|journal = The New England Journal of Medicine|date = 2015-08-06|issn = 1533-4406|pmid = 26095746|pages = 511–520|volume = 373|issue = 6|doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1502000|first = Charles V.|last = Pollack|first2 = Paul A.|last2 = Reilly|first3 = John|last3 = Eikelboom|first4 = Stephan|last4 = Glund|first5 = Peter|last5 = Verhamme|first6 = Richard A.|last6 = Bernstein|first7 = Robert|last7 = Dubiel|first8 = Menno V.|last8 = Huisman|first9 = Elaine M.|last9 = Hylek}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
Dabigatran is used to prevent [[stroke]]s in those with [[atrial fibrillation]] not caused by [[heart valve]] issues, as well as [[deep vein thrombosis]] and [[pulmonary embolism]] in persons who have been treated for 5–10 days with parenteral anticoagulant (usually [[low molecular weight heparin]]), and to prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in some circumstances.<ref>http://www.drugs.com/pro/pradaxa.html Pradaxa</ref>

It appears to be as effective as [[warfarin]] in preventing nonhemorrhagic strokes and embolic events in those with atrial fibrillation not due to valve problems.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gómez-Outes|first1=A|last2=Terleira-Fernández |first2=AI |last3=Calvo-Rojas|first3=G|last4=Suárez-Gea|first4=ML|last5=Vargas-Castrillón |first5=E |title=Dabigatran, Rivaroxaban, or Apixaban versus Warfarin in Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Subgroups |journal=Thrombosis |date=2013 |volume=2013 |pages=640723 |pmid=24455237 |doi=10.1155/2013/640723 |pmc=3885278}}</ref>

Dabigatran is contraindicated in patients who have active pathological bleeding, since dabigatran can increase bleeding risk and can also cause serious and potentially life-threatening bleeds.<ref name=dailymedPI>Pradaxa (dabigatran etexilate mesylate) Prescribing Information:  http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=ba74e3cd-b06f-4145-b284-5fd6b84ff3c9#Section_5.4, accessed October 29, 2014.</ref>  Dabigatran is also contraindicated in patients who have a history of serious hypersensitivity reaction to dabigatran (e.g. [[anaphylaxis]] or anaphylactic shock).<ref name=dailymedPI />  The use of dabigatran should also be avoided in patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves due to the increased risk of thromboembolic events (e.g. valve thrombosis, stroke, and [[myocardial infarction]]) and major bleeding associated with dabigatran in this population.<ref name=dailymedPI /><ref>{{cite web|title=FDA Drug Safety Communication: Pradaxa (dabigatran etexilate mesylate) should not be used in patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm332912.htm|website=U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)|accessdate=October 29, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Eikelboom |first1=JW |last2=Connolly |first2=SJ |last3=Brueckmann |first3=M|title=Dabigatran versus Warfarin in Patients with Mechanical Heart Valves |journal=N Engl J Med |date=September 2013 |volume=369 |pages=1206–1214 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1300615 |pmid=23991661 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==

The most commonly reported side effect of dabigatran is gastrointestinal upset. When compared to people anticoagulated with warfarin, patients taking dabigatran had fewer life-threatening bleeds, fewer minor and major bleeds, including intracranial bleeds, but the rate of gastrointestinal bleeding was significantly higher. Dabigatran capsules contain tartaric acid, which lowers the gastric pH and is required for adequate absorption. The lower pH has previously been associated with [[dyspepsia]]; some hypothesize that this plays a role in the increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.<ref>{{cite journal | author=ML Blommel | title=Dabigatran etexilate: A novel oral direct thrombin inhibitor | journal=Am J Health Syst Pharm  | year=2011 | volume = 68 | pages= 1506–19 | pmid=21817082 | doi=10.2146/ajhp100348 | issue=16 | displayauthors=etal  }}</ref>

==History==

Dabigatran (then compound BIBR 953) was discovered from a panel of chemicals with similar structure to [[benzamidine]]-based [[thrombin]] inhibitor α-NAPAP (''N''-alpha-(2-naphthylsulfonylglycyl)-4-amidinophenylalanine piperidide), which had been known since the 1980s as a powerful inhibitor of various [[serine protease]]s, specifically thrombin, but also [[trypsin]]. Addition of ethyl [[ester]] and hexyloxycarbonyl carbamide hydrophobic side chains led to the [[Oral bioavailability|orally absorbed]] [[prodrug]], BIBR 1048 (dabigatran etexilate).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hauel NH |author2= Nar H |author3=Priepke H|author4=Ries U |author5=Stassen JM |author6=Wienen W |title=Structure-based design of novel potent nonpeptide thrombin inhibitors |journal=[[J Med Chem]] |volume=45 |issue=9 |pages=1757–66 |date=April 2002  |pmid=11960487 |doi=10.1021/jm0109513 |laysummary=http://www.montrealgazette.com/health/anti+clotting+drug+heralded/3737627/story.html }}</ref>

On March 18, 2008, the [[European Medicines Agency]] granted marketing authorisation for Pradaxa for the  prevention of [[thromboembolic disease]] following hip or knee replacement surgery and for non-valvular atrial fibrillation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emea.europa.eu/ema/humandocs/Humans/EPAR/pradaxa/pradaxa.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120802103810/http://www.emea.europa.eu/ema/humandocs/Humans/EPAR/pradaxa/pradaxa.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-08-02 |title=Pradaxa EPAR |work=[[European Medicines Agency]] |accessdate=2011-01-30 }}</ref>

The [[National Health Service]] in Britain authorised the use of dabigatran for use in preventing blood clots in hip and knee surgery patients. According to a BBC article in 2008, Dabigatran was expected to cost the NHS £4.20 per day, which was similar to several other [[anticoagulant]]s.<ref name='bbc1'>{{cite news | title= Clot drug 'could save thousands' | date=2008-04-20 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7354818.stm | work=[[BBC News Online]] | accessdate=2008-04-21 }}</ref>

In May 2014 the FDA reported the results of a large study comparing dabigatran to warfarin in 134,000 Medicare patients.  The Agency concluded that dabigatran is associated with a lower risk of overall mortality, ischemic stroke, and bleeding in the brain than warfarin. Gastrointestinal bleeding was more common in those treated with dabigatran than in those treated with warfarin.  The risk of heart attack was similar between the two drugs. The Agency reiterated its opinion that dabigatran's overall risk/benefit ratio is favorable.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm396470.htm |title=FDA Drug Safety Communication: FDA study of Medicare patients finds risks lower for stroke and death but higher for gastrointestinal bleeding with Pradaxa (dabigatran) compared to warfarin |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

On July 26, 2014, the [[British Medical Journal]] (BMJ) published a series of investigations that accused Boehringer of withholding critical information about the need for monitoring to protect patients from severe bleeding, particularly in the elderly. Review of internal communications between Boehringer researchers and employees, the FDA and the EMA revealed that Boehringer researchers found evidence that serum levels of dabigatran vary widely. The BMJ investigation suggested that Boehringer had a financial motive to withhold this concern from regulatory health agencies because the data conflicted with their extensive marketing of dabigatran as an anticoagulant that does not require monitoring.<ref name="PMID25055829">{{cite journal| author=Cohen, D |title=Dabigatran: how the drug company withheld important analyses | journal=[[BMJ]] | date=July 2014 | volume=349 |pages=g4670 | pmid=25055829 | doi=10.1136/bmj.g4670 }}</ref><ref name="PMID25056265">{{cite journal| author= Moore TJ| author2=  Cohen MR| author3= Mattison DR |title=Dabigatran, bleeding, and the regulators | journal=[[BMJ]] | date=July 2014 | volume=349 |pages=g4517 | pmid=25056265 | doi=10.1136/bmj.g4517 }}</ref>
