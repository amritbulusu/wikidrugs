==Uses==

===Medical===
Desomorphine was previously used in Switzerland and Russia for the treatment of severe pain; although for many years up to 1981, when its use was terminated, it was being used to treat a single person in [[Bern, Switzerland]] with a rare illness.<ref name = croc>{{cite journal|last=Gahr|first=M|author2=Freudenmann, RW |author3=Hiemke, C |author4=Gunst, IM |author5=Connemann, BJ |author6= Schönfeldt-Lecuona, C |title=Desomorphine goes "crocodile".|journal=Journal of Addictive Diseases|date=2012|volume=31|issue=4|pages=407–12|doi=10.1080/10550887.2012.735570|pmid=23244560|url=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/233938321_Desomorphine_goes_crocodile}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=April 2016}} While desomorphine was found to be faster acting and more effective than morphine for the rapid relief of severe pain, its shorter duration of action and the relatively more severe respiratory depression produced at equianalgesic doses, as well as a high incidence of other side effects such as [[hypotension]] and [[urinary retention]], were felt to outweigh any potential advantages.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Eddy NB ''et al.'' | year = 1957 | title = Synthetic Substances with Morphine-like Effect: Clinical Experience: Potency, Side-Effects, Addiction Liability (Monographs on Individual Drugs: Desomorphine); | url = | journal = Bull World Health Organization | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 569–863 }}</ref><ref>Matiuk DM.

=== Recreational ===
Desomorphine abuse in [[Russia]] attracted international attention in 2010 due to an increase in clandestine production, presumably due to its relatively simple synthesis from [[codeine]] available [[over-the-counter]]. Abuse of homemade desomorphine was first reported in Siberia in 2003 when Russia started a major crackdown on heroin production and trafficking, but has since spread throughout Russia and the neighboring former Soviet republics.<ref name = croc/>

The drug can be made from [[codeine]] and [[iodine]] derived from over-the-counter medications and [[red phosphorus]] from match strikers,<ref>{{cite journal |pages=361–70 |doi=10.1134/S1061934808040096 |title=Chromatographic study of expert and biological samples containing desomorphine |year=2011 |last1=Savchuk |first1=S.

M. |journal=Journal of Analytical Chemistry |volume=63 |issue=4}}</ref> in a process similar to the manufacturing of [[methamphetamine]] from [[pseudoephedrine]]. Like methamphetamine, desomorphine made this way is often contaminated with various agents. The street name in Russia for homemade desomorphine is '''krokodil''' ({{lang-ru|крокодил|links=no}}, [[crocodile]]), possibly related to the chemical name of the precursor [[α-chlorocodide]], or similarity of a skin, damaged by the drug use, to crocodile leather.<ref name = croc/> Due to difficulties in procuring [[heroin]], combined with easy and cheap access to over-the-counter pharmacy products containing codeine in Russia, use of krokodil increased until 2012.<ref name = drugpo/> In 2012 the Russian federal government introduced new restrictions for the sale of codeine-containing medications. This policy change likely diminished, but did not extinguish krokodil use in Russia.<ref name="Zheluk A, Quinn C, Meylakhs P 2014 e212">{{cite journal |vauthors=Zheluk A, Quinn C, Meylakhs P | title = Internet Search and Krokodil in the Russian Federation: An Infoveillance Study | journal = Journal of Medical Internet Research | volume = 16 | issue = 9 | pages = e212 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25236385 | pmc =  4180331| doi = 10.2196/jmir.3203 }}</ref> It has been estimated that around 100,000 people use krokodil in Russia and around 20,000 in Ukraine.<ref name = drugpo>{{cite journal |vauthors=Grund JP, Latypov A, Harris M | title = Breaking worse: The emergence of krokodil and excessive injuries among people who inject drugs in Eurasia | journal = International Journal of Drug Policy | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 265–274 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23726898 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.drugpo.2013.04.007 }}</ref> One death in [[Poland]] in December 2011 was also believed to have been caused by krokodil use, and its use has been confirmed among Russian expatriate communities in a number of other European countries.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Skowronek R, Celiński R, Chowaniec C | title = "Crocodile" – new dangerous designer drug of abuse from the East | journal = Clinical Toxicology | volume = 50 | issue = 4 | pages = 269 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22385107 | pmc =  | doi = 10.3109/15563650.2012.660574 }}</ref> A single case of desomorphine use was reported in Spain in 2014, with the drug consumed orally rather than by injection.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Baquero Escribano A, Beltrán Negre MT, Calvo Orenga G, Carratalá Monfort S, Arnau Peiró F, Meca Zapatero S, Haro Cortés G | date = Jun 2016 | title = Orally ingestion of krokodil in Spain: report of a case | url = | journal = Adicciones | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 242–245 | pmid = 27391849 | doi=10.20882/adicciones.828}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==

===Toxicity===
====Toxicity of desomorphine====
Animal studies comparing pure desomorphine to morphine showed it to have increased [[toxicity]], more potent [[Analgesic|relief of pain]], higher levels of [[sedation]], decreased [[Anaerobic respiration|respiration]], and increased [[digestion|digestive]] activity.<ref name=DEA/>

====Toxicity of "krokodil"====
Illicitly produced desomorphine is typically far from pure and often contains large amounts of [[toxic]] substances as a result of being "cooked" and used without any significant effort to remove the byproducts and leftovers from synthesis. Injecting any such mixture can cause serious damage to the [[skin]], [[blood vessels]], [[bone]] and [[muscles]], sometimes requiring limb amputation in long-term users.<ref name = lifsci/>

Causes of this damage are from [[iodine]] and [[phosphorus]] (and other toxic substances) that are present after synthesis. Addicts often use readily available but relatively toxic and impure solvents such as gasoline or paint thinner during the reaction scheme, without adequately removing them afterwards before injection. Strong acids and bases such as hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide are also employed without measuring [[pH]] of the final solution and analysis of leftover solutions of "krokodil" in used syringes showed the pH was typically less than 3 (i.e. as acidic as lemon juice). Failure to remove insoluble fillers and binding aids from the codeine tablets used as starting material, as well as co-administration with pharmaceuticals such as [[tropicamide]] and [[tianeptine]], are also cited as possible contributors to the high toxicity observed in users.

The frequent occurrence of tissue damage and infection among illicit users are what gained the drug its nickname of the [[flesh-eating disease|flesh-eating]] drug, as homemade versions made under inadequate conditions contain multiple impurities and toxic substances that lead to severe tissue damage and subsequent infection as a direct consequence of use. The pure form of the drug itself does not cause this damage and, despite the severe health impacts and short survival times commonly reported, there are also rarer cases of krokodil users more skilled in the manufacturing process who have used the drug for many years without experiencing the tissue damage associated with the impure "street" product.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Florez DH, Dos Santos Moreira AM, da Silva PR, Brandão R, Borges MM, de Santana FJ, Borges KB | date = Jan 2017 | title = Desomorphine (Krokodil): An overview of its chemistry, pharmacology, metabolism, toxicology and analysis | url = | journal = Drug Alcohol Depend | volume = 173 | issue = | pages = 59–68 | doi = 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2016.12.021 | pmid = 28199917 }}</ref><ref name="Desomorphine Krokodil Basics">{{cite web|title=Desomorphine (Krokodil) Basics|url=http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/desomorphine/desomorphine_basics.shtml|publisher=Erowid|accessdate=3 April 2014}}</ref>

[[Gangrene]], [[phlebitis]], [[thrombosis]] (blood clots), [[pneumonia]], [[meningitis]], [[septicaemia]] (blood infection), [[osteomyelitis]] (bone infection), liver and kidney damage, brain damage and [[HIV/AIDS]] are common serious adverse health effects observed among users of krokodil.<ref name = drugpo/> Sometimes, the user will miss the vein when injecting the desomorphine, creating an [[abscess]] and causing death of the flesh surrounding the entry-point.<ref name=lifsci/>

===Reinforcement disorders===
Early medical trials of humans taking desomorphine have resulted in the finding that, like morphine and most other analgesics of the morphine type, small amounts are highly [[addictive]] and tolerance to the drug develops quickly. However, though tolerance to respiratory depression with repeated doses was observed in rats, early clinical trials failed to show any tolerance to these same effects with repeated doses in humans.<ref name=DEA>{{cite web|title=DESOMORPHINE (Dihydrodesoxymorphine; dihydrodesoxymorphine-D; Street Name: Krokodil, Crocodil|url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_chem_info/desomorphine.pdf|publisher=Drug Enforcement Administration|accessdate=3 April 2014}}</ref>

==Chemistry==
Desomorphine has a molecular weight of 271.35 g/mol and three salts are known: [[hydrobromic acid|hydrobromide]] (as in the original '''Permonid''' brand; free-base conversion ratio 0.770), [[hydrochloric acid|hydrochloride]] (0.881) and sulfate (0.802).<ref>{{cite web|title=Permonid|work=PubChem Compound|publisher=National Library of Medicine|accessdate=5 May 2014|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=5362456}}</ref> Its freebase form is slightly soluble in water (1.425 g/L at 25&nbsp;°C), although its salts are very water-soluble; its freebase form is also very soluble in most polar organic solvents (like [[acetone]], [[ethanol]] and [[ethyl acetate]]).<ref name = lifsci>{{cite journal|last=Katselou|first=M|author2=Papoutsis, I |author3=Nikolaou, P |author4=Spiliopoulou, C |author5= Athanaselis, S |title=A "Krokodil" emerges from the murky waters of addiction.

== History ==
Desomorphine was first synthesised in the U.S. in 1932 and patented on November 13, 1934.<ref name = croc/> In Russia, desomorphine was declared an illegal narcotic analgesic in 1998. However, while codeine-containing drugs generally have been prescription products in Europe, in Russia they were sold freely over-the-counter until June 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gazeta.ru/social/2011/06/23/3673229.shtml|title= Без рецепта не обезболят|author= Берсенева А. |date= 23 June 2011|website=[[Gazeta.ru]]|accessdate=12 January 2014}}</ref> The number of users in Russia was estimated to have reached around one million at the peak of the drug's popularity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Krokodil|url=http://www.oasas.ny.gov/AdMed/FYI/Krokodil.cfm|publisher=New York State Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services|accessdate=3 April 2014}}</ref>

==Society and culture==

=== Legal status ===
In the US, desomorphine is a Schedule 1 controlled substance, indicating that the United States [[FDA]] has determined that there are no legal medicinal uses for desomorphine in the [[United States|U.S.]] It has maintained this status as a controlled substance in the United States since 1936.<ref name = DEA/> The drug is a Narcotic in Schedule I of the [[Controlled Substances Act]] 1970 of the United States as drug number ([[ACSCN]]) 9055. It is therefore subject to annual aggregate manufacturing quotas in the United States, and in 2014 the quota for desomorphine was 5 grams.<ref>http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/quotas/2014/fr0825.htm</ref> It is produced as a hydrochloride (free base conversion ratio 0.85) and sulphate (0.80)<ref>http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/quotas/conv_factor/index.html</ref>

=== North American media ===
The media in the U.S. and [[Canada]] have brought awareness to desomorphine. There have been incidents reported where desomorphine had supposedly been present within either country,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Haskin A, Kim N, Aguh C | date = Apr 2016 | title = A new drug with a nasty bite: A case of krokodil-induced skin necrosis in an intravenous drug user | journal = JAAD Case Rep | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 174–6 | doi = 10.1016/j.jdcr.2016.02.007 | pmid = 27222881 | pmc=4864092}}</ref> but no incidents have been confirmed by any [[Drug test|drug-testing]] or analytical results, and desomorphine use in North America is still considered unconfirmed.<ref>{{cite book|title=No Confirmed Reports of Desomorphine ( "Krokodil" / "Crocodile" ) in Canada|date=November 21, 2013|publisher=Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse|isbn=978-1-77178-052-0|url=http://www.ccsa.ca/Resource%20Library/ccsa-CCENDU-Desomorphine-Bulletin-2013-en.pdf}}</ref><ref name="MullinsSchwarz2014">{{cite journal|vauthors = Mullins ME, Schwarz ES|title=‘Krokodil’ in the United States Is an Urban Legend and Not a Medical Fact|journal=The American Journal of Medicine|volume=127|issue=7|year=2014|pages=e25|issn=0002-9343|doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2014.01.040}}</ref>
