'''Methcathinone'''{{Pronunciation-needed}} ('''α-[[methyl]][[amino]]-[[propiophenone]]''' or '''ephedrone''') (sometimes called "'''cat'''" or "'''jeff'''" or "'''catnip'''" or "'''intash'''" ) is a [[monoamine]] [[alkaloid]] and [[psychoactive]] [[stimulant]], a substituted [[cathinone]]. It is used as a recreational drug due to its potent stimulant and [[euphoria|euphoric]] effects and is considered to be [[Substance use disorder|addictive]], with both physical and psychological withdrawal occurring if its use is discontinued after prolonged or high-dosage administration.<ref name="calkins 2005">{{cite journal | pmid = 8594170 | volume=27 | journal = Journal of Psychoactive Drugs | issue=3 | title = Methcathinone: the next illicit stimulant epidemic? | year=1995 | pages=277–85 |vauthors=Calkins RF, Aktan GB, Hussain KL | doi=10.1080/02791072.1995.10472472}}</ref> It is usually [[Nasal administration|snorted]], but can be smoked, injected, or taken orally.

Methcathinone is listed as a [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Schedule I|Schedule I controlled substance]] by the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]] and the [[United States]]' [[Controlled Substances Act]], and as such it is not considered to be safe or effective in the treatment, diagnosis, prevention, or cure of any disease, and has no approved medical use. Possession and distribution of methcathinone for the purpose of human consumption is illegal under any/all circumstances in the United States and is either illegal or highly regulated in most jurisdictions world-wide.

==History==
Methcathinone was first synthesized in 1928 in the United States<ref name="hyde1928">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hyde JF, Browning E, Adams R | year = 1928| title = Synthetic Homologs of d,l-Ephedrine |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society   | volume = 50 | issue = 8| pages = 2287–2292 | doi = 10.1021/ja01395a032 }}</ref> and was patented by Parke Davis in 1957.<ref>US Patent 2802865 -ETHYLAMINOPROPIOPHENONE COMPOUNDS</ref> It was used in the [[Soviet Union]] during the 1930s and 1940s as an [[anti-depressant]] (under the name ''Эфедрон''—''ephedrone''). Methcathinone has long been used as a drug of abuse in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Russia]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Circa 1994, the United States government recommended to the [[UN Secretary-General]] that methcathinone should be listed as a [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Schedule I|Schedule I controlled substance]] in the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]].<ref>[http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/chemicals_law1.shtml Erowid]</ref>

In parts of Europe this drug is not listed as a dangerous drug and is under review by the authorities in the United Kingdom where at the moment it is a [[class B drugs|Class B]] drug.  They want it reclassified as a class A drug when it is dissolved in water for injection use just as amphetamine is.

==Chemistry==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}
Methcathinone is a beta-keto N-methylamphetamine and is closely related to the naturally occurring compounds, [[cathinone]] and [[cathine]]. It is also very closely related to [[methamphetamine]], differing by only the β-[[ketone]] substituent and differing from [[amphetamine]] by both a keto and N-methyl substituent. Its carbon skeleton is identical to pseudoephedrine and methamphetamine. It differs from pseudoephedrine in that the hydroxide beta to the aromatic ring is oxidized to a ketone.

Methcathinone possesses a [[chiral carbon]] atom, and therefore ''two'' enantiomers are possible. When it is made semi-synthetically  from pseudo/ephedrine as a starting material, then only a single enantiomer is produced. Given that the chiral center is adjacent to the carbonyl group, the molecule will [[racemization|racemize]] in solution.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Methcathinone production utilizes the [[oxidation]] of [[pseudoephedrine]] or [[ephedrine]], the former being preferred because of much higher yields achieved. Oxidation of [[pseudoephedrine]] to methcathinone requires little [[chemistry]] experience, making it (relatively) easy to synthesize.<ref>[https://www.scribd.com/doc/35411/The-Clandestine-Chemists-Notebook The Clandestine Chemists Notebook]</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=September 2014}} [[Potassium permanganate]] (KMnO<sub>4</sub>) is most commonly used as the oxidant.

In clandestine laboratories, synthesizing methcathinone using potassium permanganate is considered undesirable because of the low yields and the high toxicity of this oxidant, however, if done in a proper laboratory using the proper procedures potassium permanganate can be a high-yielding reactant. A method that yields more methcathinone is oxidizing (pseudo)ephedrine with [[Jones oxidation|chromium (VI)]] compounds.

Methcathinone as free base is very unstable; it easily loses its [[ketone]] group, which is substituted with a [[hydroxyl]] group . Structurally, this occurs when the C=O bond at the Rβ-position is converted into a C-OH bond. Additionally, a dimerization reaction has been observed in solutions of freebase methcathinone, which yields a biologically inactive compound.<ref>http://chromsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/32/12/552.full.pdf+html</ref> In other words, basic methcathinone will turn into (& also metabolize to) [[pseudoephedrine]], from which it was synthesized.{{contradiction inline|reason=The statement "dimerization...yields a biologically inactive compound" contradicts the following restatement "In other words, basic methcathinone will turn into ... pseudoephedrine" because pseudoephedrine is not the dimer|date=September 2014}}

== Effects ==

Methcathinone hydrochloride increases spontaneous rodent [[Animal locomotion|locomotor]] activity,<ref name="pmid3575369">{{cite journal |vauthors=Glennon RA, Yousif M, Naiman N, Kalix P |title=Methcathinone: a new and potent amphetamine-like agent |journal=Pharmacol.

The effects of methcathinone are similar to those of [[methamphetamine]], initially deemed to be less intense by the inexperienced user, and often more euphoric.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}  The effects have been compared to those of [[cocaine]], since it commonly causes [[hypertension]] (elevated blood pressure) and [[tachycardia]] (elevated heart rate).

Reported effects include:{{medcn|date=September 2014}}

* Feelings of [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]]
* Increased alertness
* Slurred speech
* Shaking of the limbs
* Increased heart rate
* Risk of blood clots on the brain, heart attacks or strokes
* Headaches or Migraine attacks
* Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) or pains in the stomach
* Increased empathy and sense of communication
* Both decreased and increased sexual function and desire
* Bruxism
The effects of methcathinone usually last from four to six hours.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Pharmacology==
Methcathinone has very strong affinities for the dopamine transporter and the norepinephrine (noradrenaline) transporter. Its affinity for the serotonin transporter is less than that of methamphetamine.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Rothman, B. R.| title = In Vitro Characterization of Ephedrine-Related Stereoisomers at Biogenic Amine Transporters and the Receptorome Reveals Selective Actions as Norepinephrine Transporter Substrates | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 307 | issue = 1 |date=June 2003 | doi = 10.1124/jpet.103.053975 | pages = 138–45 | pmid = 12954796|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

The [[ketone|C=O bond]] at the ''R<sub>β</sub>''-position (directly right of the benzene ring) is slightly polar, and as a result the drug does not cross the lipid [[blood–brain barrier]] quite as well as [[amphetamine]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Nevertheless, it is a potent CNS [[stimulant]] and [[dopamine reuptake inhibitor]]. Chronic high dosage use may result in acute mental confusion ranging from mild [[paranoia]] to [[psychosis]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} These symptoms typically disappear quickly if use is stopped.

Anecdotal reports have provided some information on patterns of methcathinone use. The most common [[route of administration]] is via [[human nose|nasal]] [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflation]] (snorting).{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Other routes of administration include ''[[per os]]'', [[intravenous injection|IV injection]] and [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]].

==Illicit usage==
Methcathinone binges resemble amphetamine binges in that the user may not sleep or eat, and takes in little in the way of liquids. The methcathinone binge is followed by long periods of sleep, excess eating, long-lasting nosebleeds ([[insufflation]] of methcathinone is corrosive to the [[nasal mucosa]] in the same manner as its methamphetamine counterpart) and, in some cases, [[clinical depression|depression]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

==Addiction==
In preclinical studies, methcathinone [[hydrochloride]] produces an abuse potential similar to that of the [[amphetamines]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 8029273 | volume=47 | issue=4 | title=Intravenous self-injection of methcathinone in the baboon |date=April 1994 | pages=981–3 |vauthors=Kaminski BJ, Griffiths RR | journal=Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. | doi=10.1016/0091-3057(94)90307-7}}</ref>

Methcathinone can be highly psychologically addictive, and can produce a [[methamphetamine]]-like withdrawal, which is somewhat less in intensity than [[methamphetamine]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In [[psychoactive drug|drug]] [[discrimination]] studies, methcathinone hydrochloride evokes responses similar to those induced by both [[Dextroamphetamine|dextroamphetamine sulfate]] and [[cocaine]] hydrochloride. When examined in particular pharmacological assays for [[psychomotor]]{{disambiguation needed|date=August 2013}} [[stimulant]]-like activity, both the [[dextrorotary]] and [[levorotary]] [[enantiomeric]] forms of methcathinone hydrochloride have been found to be pharmacologically active. In these assays, the l-form of methcathinone is more active than either d-methcathinone or dextroamphetamine (this is notable as the dextrorotary isomer is the more active isomer of both amphetamine and methamphetamine).

Some street dealers are selling methcathinone as dextroamphetamine or methamphetamine but the drug is more dangerous to people who inject it than the more common amphetamine.

==Intravenous usage==
Injecting this substance has recently been associated with symptoms similar to those seen in patients with Parkinson's Disease ([[Manganism]]) due to the compound [[manganese dioxide]] which is a byproduct of synthesis with [[permanganate]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=De Bie RM, Gladstone RM, Strafella AP, Ko JH, Lang AE |date=Jun 2007 | title = Manganese-induced Parkinsonism associated with methcathinone (Ephedrone) abuse | url = | journal = Archives of Neurology | volume = 64 | issue = 6| pages = 886–9 | pmid = 17562938 | doi=10.1001/archneur.64.6.886}}</ref>
