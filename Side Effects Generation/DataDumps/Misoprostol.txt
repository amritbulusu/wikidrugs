==Medical uses==

===Ulcer prevention===
Misoprostol is used for the prevention of [[NSAID]]-induced gastric ulcers. It acts upon gastric [[parietal cell]]s, inhibiting the secretion of [[gastric acid]] by [[G-protein coupled receptor]]-mediated inhibition of [[adenylate cyclase]], which leads to decreased intracellular [[cyclic AMP]] levels and decreased [[proton pump]] activity at the [[apical membrane|apical]] surface of the parietal cell. Because other classes of drugs, especially [[H2-receptor antagonists]] and [[proton pump inhibitors]], are more effective for the treatment of acute peptic ulcers, misoprostol is only indicated for use by people who are both taking NSAIDs and are at high risk for NSAID-induced ulcers, including the elderly and people with ulcer complications. Misoprostol is sometimes coprescribed with NSAIDs to prevent their common adverse effect of [[gastric ulcer]]ation (e.g. with [[diclofenac]] in ''[[Arthrotec]]'').

Misoprostol has other protective actions, but is only clinically effective at doses high enough to reduce gastric acid secretion. For instance, at lower doses, misoprostol may stimulate increased secretion of the protective [[mucus]] that lines the [[gastrointestinal tract]] and increase mucosal blood flow, thereby increasing mucosal integrity. However, these effects are not pronounced enough to warrant prescription of misoprostol at doses lower than those needed to achieve gastric acid suppression.

However, even in the treatment of NSAID-induced ulcers, [[omeprazole]] proved to be at least as effective as misoprostol,<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 9494149 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199803123381105 | volume=338 | issue=11 | title=Omeprazole compared with misoprostol for ulcers associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Omeprazole versus Misoprostol for NSAID-induced Ulcer Management (OMNIUM) Study Group |date=March 1998  |vauthors=Hawkey CJ, Karrasch JA, Szczepañski L, etal | journal=N. Engl. J. Med. | pages=727–34}}</ref> but was significantly better tolerated, so misoprostol should not be considered a first-line treatment. Misoprostol-induced diarrhea and the need for multiple daily doses (typically four) are the main issues impairing compliance with therapy.

===Labor induction===
Misoprostol is commonly used for [[labor induction]]. It causes [[uterine]] contractions and the ripening ([[Cervical effacement|effacement]] or thinning) of the [[cervix]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM200101043440107 |title=Misoprostol and Pregnancy |year=2001 |last1=Wood |first1=Alastair J. J. |last2=Goldberg |first2=Alisa B. |last3=Greenberg |first3=Mara B. |last4=Darney |first4=Philip D. |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=344 |pages=38–47 |pmid=11136959 |issue=1}}</ref> It can be less expensive than the other commonly used ripening agent, [[Prostaglandin E2|dinoprostone]].<ref name="summers"/>

[[Oxytocin]] has long been used as the standard agent for labor induction, but does not work well when the cervix is not yet ripe. Misoprostol also may be used in conjunction with oxytocin.<ref name="summers">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0091-2182(96)00138-3 |title=Methods of cervical ripening and labor induction |year=1997 |last1=Summers |first1=L |journal=Journal of Nurse-Midwifery |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=71–85 |pmid=9107114}}</ref>

Between 2002 and 2012, a misoprostol vaginal insert was studied, and was approved in the EU.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ferring's removable misoprostol vaginal delivery system, approved for labour induction in European Decentralised Procedure|url=http://www.ferring.com/en/media/press-releases/2013/misodel-17oct13.aspx|publisher=Ferring|accessdate=26 November 2013|date=17 October 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203041216/http://www.ferring.com/en/media/press-releases/2013/misodel-17oct13.aspx|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Wing|first=Deborah|title=Misoprostol Vaginal Insert and Time to Vaginal Delivery: A Randomized Controlled Trial|url=http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Fulltext/2013/08000/Misoprostol_Vaginal_Insert_and_Time_to_Vaginal.4.aspx#|work=Obstetrics and gynaecology|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health|accessdate=2014-05-26|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527215714/http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Fulltext/2013/08000/Misoprostol_Vaginal_Insert_and_Time_to_Vaginal.4.aspx|archivedate=2014-05-27|df=}}</ref> It was not approved for use in the USA, and the US FDA still considers cervical ripening and labor induction to be outside of the approved uses for misoprostol.<ref>{{cite web|title=Safety Information, Cytotec (misoprostol) Tablets|url=https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/ucm330991.htm|publisher=FDA|accessdate=16 March 2017|date=11 December 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120123024/http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/ucm330991.htm|archivedate=20 January 2017|df=}}</ref>

===Abortion===
Misoprostol is used either alone or in conjunction with an other medication ([[mifepristone]] or [[methotrexate]]) for [[medical abortion]]s as an alternative to [[vacuum aspiration|surgical abortion]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = WHO {{!}} Medical methods for first trimester abortion|url = http://apps.who.int/rhl/fertility/abortion/dgguide/en/|website = apps.who.int|access-date = 2016-02-04|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160214074838/http://apps.who.int/rhl/fertility/abortion/dgguide/en/|archivedate = 2016-02-14|df = }}</ref> Medical abortion has the advantage of being less invasive, and more autonomous, self-directed, and discreet.

Misoprostol is most effective when it is used with methotrexate or mifepristone (RU-486).<ref name="WHO"/> Misoprostol alone is less effective (typically 88% up to eight-weeks gestation). It is not inherently unsafe if medically supervised, but 1% of women will have heavy bleeding requiring medical attention, some women may have [[ectopic pregnancy]], and the 12% of pregnancies that continue after misoprostol failure are more likely to have birth defects and are usually followed up with a more effective method of abortion.<ref name="Gunter">[http://drjengunter.wordpress.com/2013/07/27/what-is-the-mexican-abortion-pill-and-how-safe-is-it/ What is the "Mexican abortion pill" and how safe is it?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730235702/http://drjengunter.wordpress.com/2013/07/27/what-is-the-mexican-abortion-pill-and-how-safe-is-it/ |date=2013-07-30 }} Jen Gunter, July 27, 2013</ref>

Misoprostol can also be used to dilate the cervix in preparation for a surgical abortion, particularly in the second trimester (either alone or in combination with [[laminaria]] stents).

===Missed miscarriage===
Misoprostol is sometimes used to treat early fetal death in the absence of spontaneous [[miscarriage]], but further research is needed to establish a safe, effective protocol.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002253.pub3 |title=Medical treatment for early fetal death (less than 24 weeks) |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2006 |last1=Neilson |first1=James P |last2=Hickey |first2=Martha |last3=Vazquez |first3=Juan C |editor1-last=Neilson |editor1-first=James P |pmid=16855990 |issue=3 |pages=CD002253}}</ref>

Misoprostol is regularly used in some Canadian hospitals for labour induction for fetal deaths early in pregnancy, and for termination of pregnancy for fetal anomalies. A low dose is used initially, then doubled for the remaining doses until delivery. In the case of a previous Caesarian section, however, lower doses are used.

===Postpartum bleeding===
Misoprostol is also used to prevent and treat [[post-partum bleeding]]. Orally administered misoprostol was marginally less effective than [[oxytocin]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0029-7844(02)02371-2 |title=Systematic review of randomized controlled trials of misoprostol to prevent postpartum hemorrhage |year=2002 |last1=Villar |first1=J |journal=Obstetrics & Gynecology |volume=100 |issue=6 |pmid=12468178 |pages=1301–12 |last2=Gülmezoglu |first2=AM |last3=Hofmeyr |first3=GJ |last4=Forna |first4=F}}</ref> The use of rectally administered misoprostol is optimal in cases of bleeding; it was shown to be associated with lower rates of side effects compared to other routes.

==Adverse effects==
The most commonly reported [[adverse effect]] of taking a misoprostol by mouth for the prevention of stomach ulcers is [[diarrhea]]. In clinical trials, an average 13% of patients reported diarrhea, which was dose-related and usually developed early in the course of therapy (after 13 days) and was usually self-limiting (often resolving within 8 days), but sometimes (in 2% of patients) required discontinuation of misoprostol.<ref name="Cytotec USPI">{{cite web |author=[[Pfizer]] |date=September 2006 |title=Cytotec US Prescribing Information |url=http://www.pfizer.com/pfizer/download/uspi_cytotec.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-03-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216041437/http://www.pfizer.com/pfizer/download/uspi_cytotec.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-16 |df= }}</ref>

The next most commonly reported adverse effects of taking misoprostol by mouth for the prevention of gastric ulcers are: [[abdominal pain]], [[nausea]], [[flatulence]], [[headache]], [[dyspepsia]], [[vomiting]], and [[constipation]], but none of these adverse effects occurred more often than when taking [[placebo]]s.<ref name="Cytotec USPI"/> In practice, fever is almost universal when multiple doses are given every 4 to 6 hours.{{Citation needed|reason=Strong claim is made with no citation or evidence.

Misoprostol should not be taken by pregnant women to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers because it increases uterine tone and contractions in pregnancy, which may cause partial or complete abortions, and because its use in pregnancy has been associated with birth defects.<ref name="Cytotec USPI"/><ref name="Cytotec UK SPC">{{cite web |author=[[Pharmacia]] |date=July 2004 |title=Cytotec UK SPC (Summary of Product Characteristics) |url=http://emc.medicines.org.uk/emc/assets/c/html/displaydoc.asp?documentid=9352 |accessdate=2007-03-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928060833/http://emc.medicines.org.uk/emc/assets/c/html/displaydoc.asp?documentid=9352 |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}</ref>

All cervical ripening and induction agents can cause [[uterine hyperstimulation]], which can negatively affect the blood supply to the fetus and increases the risk of complications such as uterine rupture.<ref name="briggs">{{cite journal |doi=10.2146/ajhp050265.p2 |title=Drug therapy during labor and delivery, part 2 |year=2006 |last1=Briggs |first1=G.

==Pharmacology==
Misoprostol, a [[prostaglandin analogue]], binds to myometrial cells to cause strong myometrial contractions leading to expulsion of tissue. This agent also causes cervical ripening with softening and dilation of the cervix. Misoprostol binds to and stimulates [[prostaglandin E1]] receptors, [[prostaglandin EP3 receptor]] and [[prostaglandin EP4 receptor]] but not [[Prostaglandin EP1 receptor]] and therefore is expected to have a more restricted range of physiological and potentially toxic actions than prostaglandin E2 or other analogs which activate all four prostaglandin receptors.<ref name="pmid27940058">{{cite journal | vauthors = Moreno JJ | title = Eicosanoid receptors: Targets for the treatment of disrupted intestinal epithelial homeostasis | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 796 | issue = | pages = 7–19 | year = 2017 | pmid = 27940058 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2016.12.004 | url = }}</ref>

==Society and culture==
A letter from [[G.D.

===Black market===
Misoprostol is used for [[self-induced abortion]]s in Brazil, where [[black market]] prices exceed US$100 per dose. Illegal medically unsupervised misoprostol abortions in Brazil are associated with a lower complication rate than other forms of illegal self-induced abortion, but are still associated with a higher complication rate than legal, medically supervised surgical and medical abortions. Failed misoprostol abortions are associated with birth defects in some cases.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0140-6736(93)91156-G |title=Misoprostol and illegal abortion in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil |year=1993 |last1=Costa |first1=S.
