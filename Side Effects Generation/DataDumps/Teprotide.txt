'''Teprotide''' is nonapeptide which has been isolated from the snake ''[[Bothrops jararaca]]''.  It is an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ([[ACE inhibitor]]), which inhibits the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and may potentiate some of the pharmacological actions of [[bradykinin]]. It has a molecular formula of C<sub>53</sub>H<sub>76</sub>N<sub>14</sub>O<sub>12</sub> and has been looked at as an antihypertension agent.

==Isolation and Synthesis==

The antihypertensive effects of teprotide were first observed by Sergio Ferreira in 1965 <ref>{{cite journal|last=Ferreira|first=Sergio|title=A bradykinin-potentiating factor (bpf) present in the venom of bothrops jararaca|journal=British Journal of Pharmacology|date=February 1965|volume=24|pages=169-169|pmc=1704050|pmid=14302350|doi=10.1111/j.1476-5381.1965.tb02091.x}}</ref>   and it was first isolated by Ferreira ''et al.''<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ferreira|first=Sergio H.|author2=Diana C. Bartelt |author3=Lewis J. Greene |title=Isolation of bradykinin-potentiating peptides from ''Bothrops jararaca'' venom|journal=Biochemistry|date=June 1970|volume=9|issue=13|pages=2583–2593|doi=10.1021/bi00815a005|pmid=4317874}}</ref> along with eight other peptides in 1970.  Teprotide was synthesized in 1970 by Ondetti ''et al.''<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ondetti|first=Miguel A.|author2=Nina J. Wiliams |author3=Emily F. Sabo |author4=Josip Pluscec |author5=Eugene R. Weaver |author6=Octavian Kocy |title=Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors from the venom of bothrops jararaca.

==Medical Use==
Teprotide was chosen as a lead because of its long-lasting ''in vivo'' activity. This was demonstrated by Bianchi ''et al''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bianchi|first=A. |author2=D.B. Evans |author3=M. Cobb |author4=M.T. Peschka |author5=T.R. Schaeffer |author6=R.J. Laffan|title=Inhibition by SQ 20881 of vasopressor response to angiotensin I in conscious animals|journal=European Journal of Pharmacology|date=July 1973|volume=23|issue=2|pages=90–96|doi=10.1016/0014-2999(73)90248-3|pmid=4354808}}</ref> by administering teprotide to dogs and rats and observing that it inhibited the vasopressor response induced by angiotensin I.  Teprotide was shown to be an effective antihyperension agent but it had limited use because of its expense and lack of oral activity.  It was found that teprotide inhibits the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II.  From this researchers conducted structure-activity studies which allowed them to identify the active binding site of the ACE which allowed for the development of antihypertension drugs to be developed. Captopril was the first antihypertension drug developed by Ondetti and Cushman.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cushman|first=D.W.|author2=M.A. Ondetti |title=History of the design of captopril and related inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme|journal=Hypertension|date=April 1991|volume=17|issue=4|pages=589–592|pmid=2013486|doi=10.1161/01.hyp.17.4.589}}</ref> Many ACE inhibitors have been developed since this time but this was the start of them.
