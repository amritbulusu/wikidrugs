'''Poligeenan''' (CAS No. 53973-98-1) is a low [[viscosity]], low [[molecular weight]], [[sulfur|sulfated]] [[galactan|polygalactan]] [[polymer]] used exclusively in [[clinical diagnosis|clinical diagnostic]] applications. The polymer is derived from the molecular backbone of [[carrageenan]].

The name "poligeenan" was confirmed in 1988 by the [[United States Adopted Name|United States Adopted Names]] (USAN) Council.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1988-08-01|title=USAN Council: List No. 297|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1038/clpt.1988.145/abstract|journal=Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics|language=en|volume=44|issue=2|pages=246–248|doi=10.1038/clpt.1988.145|issn=1532-6535|via=}}</ref> The Council is sponsored by the [[American Medical Association]], the [[American Pharmaceutical Association]], and the US Pharmacopeial Convention Inc.

Prior to 1988, poligeenan was referred to as "degraded carrageenan" in the scientific literature.  The terms "poligeenan" and  "degraded carrageenan" were often used interchangeably in research articles and reports.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Beattie|first=I.

Carrageenan is an approved food additive<ref>21 C.F.R. §172.620</ref> with an extensive [[toxicology]] data base that has been reviewed by regulatory bodies and provides scientific evidence for safe inclusion in foods.  Poligeenan is not an approved food additive in the United States.  The low molecular weight of poligeenan precludes it from exhibiting functionality in food. The [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] assigned poligeenan to carcinogenic risk category 2B (possibly carcinogenic to humans).<ref>IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Human.  Agents Classified by the IARC Monographs Volumes 1-110.  Updated List 23 October, 2014 [http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Classification/]</ref>

Poligeenan is produced by the harsh acid degradation of carrageenan.  Carrageenan in solution is processed at low pH (~1.0) and high temperature ({{Convert|90|C|F|round=10}}) for up to six hours until the [[Weight average molecular weight|weight-average molecular weight]] (M<sub>w</sub>) has been reduced to the range 10,000&nbsp;– 20,000 [[Dalton (unit)|daltons]] (10-20 kDa).  The resulting poligeenan solution is neutralized and [[Spray drying|spray dried]] to a fine powder.

The primary use for poligeenan is for clinical diagnostic applications, and specifically the suspension of [[Barium sulfate suspension|barium sulfate slurries]] used in [[Radiography|X-ray studies]] of the mouth, throat, and [[esophagus]] during swallowing.  For this application, poligeenan delivers three essential properties: First, its viscosity imparts lubricity to make the slurry easier to swallow. Second, this same viscosity is high enough to maintain full suspension of all barium sulfate particles during the complete X-ray procedure.  Third, the high charge density of the poligeenan solution (ester sulfate units) prevents caking or aggregation of the barium sulfate particles during long-term storage of ready-to-use slurry products, these being easily reconstituted by shaking.  The combination of these three application properties necessitates poligeenan to have molecular weights in the range 10-20 kDa.
