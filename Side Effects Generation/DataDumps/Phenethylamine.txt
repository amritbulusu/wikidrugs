Consistent with its hypothesized role as “endogenous amphetamine,” β-PEA was shown to possess reinforcing properties, a defining feature that underlies the abuse liability of amphetamine and other psychomotor stimulants. β-PEA was also as effective as amphetamine in its ability to produce conditioned place preference (i.e., the process by which an organism learns an association between drug effects and a particular place or context) in rats (Gilbert and Cooper, 1983) and was readily self-administered by dogs that had a stable history (i.e., consisting of early acquisition and later maintenance) of amphetamine or cocaine self-administration (Risner and Jones, 1977; Shannon and Thompson, 1984). In another study, high concentrations of β-PEA dose-dependently maintained responding in monkeys that were previously trained to self-administer cocaine, and pretreatment with a MAO-B inhibitor, which delayed β-PEA deactivation, further increased response rates (Bergman et al., 2001).}}</ref><br />Moderate (with an MAO-B inhibitor)<ref name="TAAR1 and TA pharmacology 2016 review" />

'''Phenethylamine''' ('''PEA'''), also known as '''β-phenylethylamine''' ('''β-PEA''') and '''2-phenylethan-1-amine''', is an [[organic compound]], [[natural product|natural]] [[monoamine]] [[alkaloid]], and [[trace amine]] which acts as a [[central nervous system]] [[stimulant]] in humans.

''Phenethylamines'', or more properly, ''[[substituted phenethylamine]]s'' are the group of phenethylamine [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]] which contain phenethylamine as a "backbone"; in other words, this [[Chemical classification|chemical class]] includes [[derivative (chemistry)|derivative]] compounds that are formed by replacing one or more hydrogen atoms in the phenethylamine core structure with [[substituent]]s. The class of [[substituted phenethylamine]]s includes all [[substituted amphetamine]]s, and [[substituted methylenedioxyphenethylamine]]s (MDxx), and contains many drugs which act as [[empathogen]]s, [[stimulant]]s, [[psychedelic drug|psychedelics]], [[anxiolytic]]s ([[hypnotic]]s) and [[entactogen]]s, [[anorectic]]s, [[bronchodilator]]s, [[decongestant]]s, and/or [[antidepressant]]s, among others.

Phenethylamine is a primary amine, the amino-group being attached to a [[benzene ring]] through a two-carbon, or [[ethyl group]].<ref name="PubChem PEA" /> It is a colourless liquid at room temperature that has a fishy odour, and is soluble in water, [[ethanol]] and [[diethyl ether|ether]].<ref name="PubChem PEA" /> Its density is 0.964 g/ml and its boiling point is 195&nbsp;°C.<ref name="Pubchem" /> Upon exposure to air, it combines with [[carbon dioxide]] to form a solid [[carbonate]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]].<ref name = Merck>O'Neil, M.J.

===Substituted derivatives===
{{Main|Substituted phenethylamine}}
Substituted phenethylamines are a [[chemical class]] of [[organic compound]]s that are based upon the phenethylamine structure;{{#tag:ref|In other words, all of the compounds that belong to this class are [[structural analog#Chemistry|structural analogs]] of phenethylamine.|group="note"}} the class is composed of all the [[derivative (chemistry)|derivative]] compounds of phenethylamine which can be formed by replacing, or [[substitution reaction|substituting]], one or more [[hydrogen atom]]s in the phenethylamine core structure with [[substituent]]s.

Many substituted phenethylamines are psychoactive drugs which belong to a variety of different drug classes, including [[central nervous system stimulant]]s (e.g., [[amphetamine]]), [[hallucinogen]]s (e.g., [[2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine]]), [[entactogen]]s (e.g., [[3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine]]), [[appetite suppressant]]s (e.g. [[phentermine]]), [[nasal decongestant]]s and [[bronchodilator]]s (e.g., [[pseudoephedrine]]), [[antidepressant]]s (e.g. [[bupropion]]), [[antiparkinson agent]]s (e.g., [[selegiline]]), and [[vasopressor]]s (e.g., [[ephedrine]]), among others. Many of these psychoactive compounds exert their pharmacological effects primarily by modulating [[monoamine neurotransmitter]] systems; however, there is no mechanism of action or biological target that is common to all members of this subclass.

Numerous [[endogenous]] compounds – including [[hormone]]s, monoamine neurotransmitters, and many [[trace amine]]s (e.g., [[dopamine]], [[norepinephrine]], [[adrenaline]], [[tyramine]], and others) – are substituted phenethylamines. Several notable recreational drugs, such as [[MDMA]] (ecstasy), [[methamphetamine]], and [[cathinone]]s, are also members of the class. All of the [[substituted amphetamine]]s are phenethylamines as well.

Pharmaceutical drugs that are substituted phenethylamines include [[phenelzine]], [[phenformin]], and [[fanetizole]], among many others.

===Synthesis===
One method for preparing β-phenethylamine, set forth in J. C. Robinson's and H. R. Snyder's ''Organic Syntheses'' (published 1955), involves the reduction of [[benzyl cyanide]] with [[hydrogen]] in liquid [[ammonia]], in the presence of a [[Raney-Nickel]] [[catalyst]], at a temperature of 130&nbsp;°C and a pressure of 13.8 MPa. Alternative syntheses are outlined in the footnotes to this preparation.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=J. C. |last1=Robinson |first2=H. R. |last2=Snyder |year=1955 |title=β-Phenylethylamine |url=http://www.orgsyn.org/Content/pdfs/procedures/CV3P0720.pdf |journal=Organic Syntheses, Coll |volume=3 |page=720}}</ref>

A much more convenient method for the synthesis of β-phenethylamine is the reduction of [[Beta-Nitrostyrene|ω-nitrostyrene]] by [[lithium aluminum hydride]] in ether, whose successful execution was first reported by R. F. Nystrom and W. G. Brown in 1948.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/ja01191a057 |title=Reduction of Organic Compounds by Lithium Aluminum Hydride. III.

Phenethylamine can also be produced via the cathodic reduction of [[benzyl cyanide]] in a divided cell.<ref name="Shamelessly stolen from the Electrosynthesis article">{{cite journal|first1=V. |last1=Krishnan |first2= A. |last2= Muthukumaran |first3= H.

It is possible to assemble phenethylamine structures for synthesis of compounds such as [[epinephrine]], [[amphetamine]]s, [[tyrosine]] and [[dopamine]] by adding the beta-aminoethyl side chain to the [[phenyl]] ring.  This can be done via [[Friedel-Crafts acylation]] with N-protected [[acyl chloride]]s when the arene is activated, or by [[Heck reaction]] of the phenyl with N-vinyl[[oxazolone]], followed by [[hydrogenation]], or by cross-coupling with beta-amino [[organozinc]] reagents, or reacting a brominated arene with beta-aminoethyl [[organolithium]] reagents, or by [[Suzuki cross-coupling]].<ref>{{cite journal|pmc=2593899 |title=β-Aminoethyltrifluoroborates: Efficient Aminoethylations via Suzuki-Miyaura Cross-Coupling|journal=Org Lett.|date=2007-01-18|volume=9|issue=2|pages=203–206|doi=10.1021/ol062610v|author1=Gary A.

Specifically, the urinary output of PEA was lower in a population of children suffering from ADHD, as compared to the healthy control population, an observation that was paralleled by reduced PEA levels in ADHD individuals (Baker et al., 1991; Kusaga, 2002). In a consecutive study (Kusaga et al., 2002), those of the children suffering with ADHD were treated with methylphenidate, also known as Ritalin.

Thirty minutes of moderate to high intensity physical exercise has been shown to induce an enormous increase in urinary [[phenylacetic acid]], the primary metabolite of phenethylamine.<ref name="Renaissance">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lindemann L, Hoener MC | title = A renaissance in trace amines inspired by a novel GPCR family | journal = Trends Pharmacol.

As phenylacetic acid reflects phenylethylamine levels<sup>3</sup>, and the latter has antidepressant effects, the antidepressant effects of exercise appear to be linked to increased phenylethylamine concentrations. Furthermore, considering the structural and pharmacological analogy between amphetamines and phenylethylamine, it is conceivable that phenylethylamine plays a role in the commonly reported "runners high" thought to be linked to cerebral β-endorphin activity. The substantial increase in phenylacetic acid excretion in this study implies that phenylethylamine levels are affected by exercise.&nbsp;... A 30 minute bout of moderate to high intensity aerobic exercise increases phenylacetic acid levels in healthy regularly exercising men.

TAAR1 and TAAR4 labeling in all neurons appeared intracellular, consistent with previous reported results for TAAR1 (Miller, 2011). A cytoplasmic location of ligand and receptor (e.g., tyramine and TAAR1) supports intracellular activation of signal transduction pathways, as suggested previously (Miller, 2011).&nbsp;... Additionally, once transported intracellularly, they could act on presynaptic TAARs to alter basal activity (Miller, 2011).&nbsp;... As reported for TAAR1 in HEK cells (Bunzow et al., 2001; Miller, 2011), we observed cytoplasmic labeling for TAAR1 and TAAR4, both of which are activated by the TAs (Borowsky et al., 2001). A cytoplasmic location of the ligand and the receptor (e.g., tyramine and TAAR1) would support intracellular activation of signal transduction pathways (Miller, 2011). Such a co-localization would not require release from vesicles and could explain why the TAs do not appear to be found there (Berry, 2004; Burchett and Hicks, 2006).}}</ref> When either binds to TAAR1, it reduces neuron firing rate and triggers [[protein kinase A]] (PKA) and [[protein kinase C]] (PKC) signaling, resulting in DAT phosphorylation.<ref name="Miller" /><ref name="Cites Miller 2011 review" />  Phosphorylated DAT then either operates in reverse or [[endocytosis|withdraws into the axon terminal]] and ceases transport.<ref name="Miller" /><ref name="Cites Miller 2011 review" />|align=bottom}}

Although PEA, T and p-TA have been reported to be present in synaptosomes (nerve ending preparations isolated during homogenization and centrifugation of brain tissue) (24), research with reserpine and neurotoxins suggests that m- and p-TA may be stored in vesicles while PEA and T are not (25–27).&nbsp;... the antidepressant effects of exercise have been suggested to be due to an elevation of PEA (57). l-Deprenyl (selegiline), a selective inhibitor of MAO-B, is used in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease and produces a marked increase in brain levels of PEA relative to other amines (20,58).&nbsp;... Interestingly, the gene for aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), the major enzyme involved in the synthesis of the trace amines, is located in the same region of chromosome 7 that has been proposed as a susceptibility locus for ADHD (50)}}</ref>
