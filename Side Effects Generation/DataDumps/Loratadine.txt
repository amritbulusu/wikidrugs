== Medical uses ==
Loratadine is indicated for the [[symptoms|symptomatic]] relief of allergy such as [[hay fever]] (allergic rhinitis), [[urticaria]] (hives), [[chronic idiopathic urticaria]],<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 17229605| year = 2006| author1 = Pons-Guiraud| first1 = A| title = Emedastine difumarate versus loratadine in chronic idiopathic urticaria: A randomized, double-blind, controlled European multicentre clinical trial| journal = European journal of dermatology : EJD| volume = 16| issue = 6| pages = 649–54| last2 = Nekam| first2 = K| last3 = Lahovsky| first3 = J| last4 = Costa| first4 = A| last5 = Piacentini| first5 = A}}</ref> and other skin allergies.<ref name="Austria-Codex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Jasek, W|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2007|edition=2007/2008|volume=1|pages=1768–71|isbn= 978-3-85200-181-4|language=German}}</ref> For allergic rhinitis (hay fever), loratadine is effective for both nasal and eye symptoms: sneezing, runny nose, itchy or burning eyes.

Similarly to [[cetirizine]], loratadine attenuates the itching associated with [[Kimura's disease]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 21914581| year = 2011| author1 = Ueda| first1 = T| title = Kimura's disease treated with suplatast tosilate and loratadine| journal = European journal of dermatology : EJD| volume = 21| issue = 6| pages = 1020–1| last2 = Arai| first2 = S| last3 = Amoh| first3 = Y| last4 = Katsuoka| first4 = K| doi = 10.1684/ejd.2011.1539| doi-broken-date = 2017-01-16}}</ref> It is marketed for its less-sedating properties.

=== Forms ===
[[File:Loratadine10mg.png|thumb|An example of a loratadine 10-mg tablet (Rx)]]

The drug is available in many different forms, including tablets, oral suspension, and syrup,<ref name="Austria-Codex" /> and in combination with [[pseudoephedrine]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Jasek, W|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2007|edition=2007/2008|volume=1|pages=1731–34|isbn= 978-3-85200-181-4|language=German}}</ref> Also available are quick-dissolving tablets, which are marketed as being faster to get into one's circulatory system, but require special handling to avoid degrading in the package.

== Contraindications ==
Patients with severe [[hepatic]] (liver) disorders may need to start with a lower dose. No dose adaptation is necessary for elderly or [[renal]]ly (kidney) impaired patients.<ref name="Austria-Codex" /><ref name="Mutschler">{{cite book|last=Mutschler|first=Ernst|author2=Gerd Geisslinger |author3=Heyo K.

Loratadine is usually compatible with [[breast-feeding]] (classified category L-2 by the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]]).<ref>{{cite journal | title=Transfer of drugs and other chemicals into human milk | journal=Pediatrics | volume=108 | issue=3 | pages=776–89 | date=1 September 2001 | url=http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;108/3/776 | pmid=11533352 | author=Committee on Drugs | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023053121/http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics%3B108/3/776#T1 | archivedate=23 October 2007 | df= }}</ref> In the U.S., it is classified as category B in [[pregnancy]], meaning  animal reproduction studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus but no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women have been conducted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20031115/steps.html|title=Desloratadine for Allergic Rhinitis|publisher=American Family Physician|date=November 15, 2003|last1=See|first1=Sharon|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050724082052/http://www.aafp.org/afp/20031115/steps.html|archivedate=July 24, 2005|df=}}</ref>

== Adverse effects ==
As a "non-sedating" antihistamine, loratadine causes less (but still significant, in some cases) [[sedation]] and [[psychomotor retardation]] than the older antihistamines because it penetrates the [[blood brain barrier|blood/brain barrier]] to a smaller extent.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://allergies.emedtv.com/claritin/claritin-and-alcohol.html | title = Claritin and Alcohol | author = Kristi Monson, PharmD | publisher = emedtv.com | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120424203016/http://allergies.emedtv.com/claritin/claritin-and-alcohol.html | archivedate = 2012-04-24 | df =  }}</ref>

Other possible side effects include headache and [[antimuscarinic]] effects such as [[urinary retention]], dry mouth, blurred vision, and [[gastrointestinal]] problems.<ref name="Austria-Codex" /><ref name="Mutschler" />

== Interactions ==
Substances that act as inhibitors of the [[CYP3A4]] enzyme such as [[ketoconazole]], [[erythromycin]], [[cimetidine]], and [[furanocoumarin]] derivatives (found in grapefruit) lead to increased plasma levels of loratadine. This had clinically significant effects in controlled trials of higher-than-usual doses of loratadine (20&nbsp;mg).{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Antihistamines should be discontinued about 48&nbsp;hr prior to [[skin allergy test]]s, since these drugs may prevent or diminish otherwise-positive reactions to dermal activity indicators.

== Pharmacology ==
=== Mechanism of action ===
Loratadine is a tricyclic antihistamine, which acts as a selective [[inverse agonist]] of peripheral [[histamine]] [[histamine H1 receptor|H<sub>1</sub>-receptors]].<ref name="Mutschler" /><ref name=Devillier2008rev>Devillier P, Roche N, Faisy C. Clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of desloratadine, fexofenadine and levocetirizine : a comparative review. Clin Pharmacokinet. 2008;47(4):217-30. {{PMID|18336052}}</ref> The potency of 2nd generation histamine antagonists is (from strongest to weakest) [[desloratadine]] (Ki 0.4 nM) > levoceterizine (Ki 3 nM) > [[cetirizine]] (Ki 6 NM) > [[fexofenadine]] (Ki 10 NM) > terfenadine > loratadine.  However, the onset of action varies significantly and clinical efficacy is not always directly related to only the H2 receptor potency. <ref name=Devillier2008rev/>{{Verify source|date=June 2017}}

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Loratadine is given orally, is well absorbed from the [[gastrointestinal tract]], and has rapid [[first-pass metabolism|first-pass hepatic metabolism]]; it is metabolized by [[isoenzyme]]s of the [[cytochrome P450]] system, including [[CYP3A4]], [[CYP2D6]], and, to a lesser extent, several others.<ref name=Foye>{{cite book |author=Nelson, Wendel L. |editors=Williams, David H.; Foye, William O.; Lemke, Thomas L. |title=Foye's principles of medicinal chemistry |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |year=2002 |chapter=Antihistamines and related antiallergic and antiulcer agents |pages=805 |isbn=0-683-30737-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Ghosal A, Gupta S, Ramanathan R, etal |title=Metabolism of loratadine and further characterization of its in vitro metabolites |journal=Drug Metab Lett |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=162–70 |date=August 2009 |pmid=19702548 |doi=10.2174/187231209789352067}}</ref> Loratadine is almost totally (97–99%) bound to [[plasma proteins]]. Its metabolite [[desloratadine]], which is largely responsible for the antihistaminergic effects, binds to plasma proteins by 73–76%.<ref name="Austria-Codex" />

Loratadine's peak effect occurs after one to two hours, and its biological [[half-life]] is on average 8 hours (range 3 to 20 hours) with desloratadine's half-life being 27 hours (range 9 to 92 hours), accounting for its long-lasting effect.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 12169042| year = 2002| author1 = Affrime| first1 = M| title = A pharmacokinetic profile of desloratadine in healthy adults, including elderly| journal = Clinical pharmacokinetics| volume = 41 Suppl 1| pages = 13–9| last2 = Gupta| first2 = S| last3 = Banfield| first3 = C| last4 = Cohen| first4 = A| doi=10.2165/00003088-200241001-00003}}</ref> About 40% is excreted as conjugated metabolites into the urine, and a similar amount is excreted into the feces. Traces of unmetabolised loratadine can be found in the urine.<ref name="Austria-Codex" />

In structure, it is closely related to [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s, such as [[imipramine]], and is distantly related to the atypical [[antipsychotic]] [[quetiapine]].<ref name="pmid10444229">{{cite journal |author=Kay GG, Harris AG |title=Loratadine: a nonsedating antihistamine.

== History ==
Schering-Plough developed loratadine as part of a quest for a potential [[blockbuster drug]]: a [[sedative|nonsedating]] antihistamine. However, by the time Schering submitted the drug to the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for approval, the agency had already approved a competitor's nonsedating antihistamine, [[terfenadine]] (trade name Seldane), and, therefore, put loratadine on a lower priority.<ref name="NYTimes">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/11/magazine/the-claritin-effect-prescription-for-profit.html?pagewanted=1 | work=The New York Times | title=The Claritin Effect; Prescription for Profit | first=Stephen S. | last=Hall | date=2001-03-11 | accessdate=2010-06-28 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527160442/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/11/magazine/the-claritin-effect-prescription-for-profit.html?pagewanted=1 | archivedate=2015-05-27 | df= }}</ref>

Loratadine was approved by the FDA in 1993.<ref name="NYTimes" /> The drug continued to be available only by prescription in the U.S. until it went off patent in 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/schering-plough-loses-patent-lawsuit-over-claritin-opening-door-for-cheaper-generic-versions-70880857.html|title=Schering-Plough Loses Patent Lawsuit Over Claritin, Opening Door For Cheaper Generic Versions|last=|first=|date=2003-08-05|website=[[PRNewswire]]|publisher=Leiner Health Products|access-date=2016-06-26|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812201604/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/schering-plough-loses-patent-lawsuit-over-claritin-opening-door-for-cheaper-generic-versions-70880857.html|archivedate=2016-08-12|df=}}</ref> It was then subsequently approved for over-the-counter sales. Once it became an unpatented over-the-counter drug, the price dropped significantly.

Schering also [[drug development|developed]] [[desloratadine]] (Clarinex), which is an [[active metabolite]] of loratadine.

===Over the counter regulation===
In 1998, in an unprecedented action, the American insurance company [[Anthem Inc.|Anthem]] petitioned the FDA to allow loratadine and two other antihistamines to be made available over the counter (OTC) while it was still under patent; the FDA granted the request, which was not binding on manufacturers.<ref name=Cohen>Cohen JP et al.
