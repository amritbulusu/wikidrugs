'''5-MAPB''' ('''1-(benzofuran-5-yl)-''N''-methylpropan-2-amine''') is an [[entactogen]]ic [[designer drug]] similar to [[MDMA]] on its structure and effects.<ref name='ACMD report'>{{cite web | url = https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/temporary-class-drug-order-report-on-benzofury-and-nbome-compounds | title = Temporary class drug order report on 5-6APB and NBOMe compounds | accessdate = 2013-07-10 | date = 4 Jun 2013 | publisher = UK Home Office}}</ref>

==Legal Status==

===Canada===
5-MAPB is not listed itself in the CDSA but since it is structurally related to [[MDMA]] it would be considered illegal in Canada.<ref name="Schedule 1 of the CDSA">{{cite web | url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-38.8/page-24.html#h-28 | title='Schedule I' | publisher= Government Of Canada | date=2014-12-12}}</ref>

===China===
As of October 2015 5-MAPB is a controlled substance in China.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sfda.gov.cn/WS01/CL0056/130753.html | title=关于印发《非药用类麻醉药品和精神药品列管办法》的通知 | publisher=China Food and Drug Administration | date=27 September 2015 | language=Chinese | accessdate=1 October 2015}}</ref>

===United Kingdom===

5-MAPB was originally banned in the UK in June 2013 under a [[Temporary class drug]] order.<ref name="HO press release">{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nbome-and-benzofury-to-be-banned | title='NBOMe' and 'Benzofury' banned | publisher=UK Home Office | date=2013-06-04 | accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref> On March 5, 2014 the UK Home Office announced that 5-MAPB would be made a class B drug on 10 June 2014 alongside every other benzofuran entactogen and many structurally related drugs.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2014/9780111110904 | title = The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Ketamine etc.) (Amendment) Order 2014 | accessdate = 2014-03-11 | author = UK Home Office | date = 2014-03-05 | publisher = UK Government}}</ref>

===Metabolism and toxicity===

==Pharmacodynamics==

5-MAPB binds to the dopamine transporter in rat brain cells with a lower potency than cocaine. ''[[In silico]]'' data suggests that the primary action on dopamine is through reversal of the transporter to release dopamine. This is consistent with the effects and it is likely that it exerts a similar action on serotonin and norepinephrine transporters.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Sahai |first=Michelle A |last2=Davidson |first2=Colin |last3=Khelashvili |first3=George  |year=2016 |title=Combined in vitro and in silico approaches to the assessment of stimulant properties of novel psychoactive substances – The case of the benzofuran 5-MAPB |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278584616303979 |journal=Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry |volume=75 |pages=1-9 |doi=10.1016/j.pnpbp.2016.11.004}}</ref>
