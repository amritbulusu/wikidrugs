Propranolol is used for treating various conditions, including:

===Cardiovascular===
* [[Hypertension]]
* [[Angina pectoris]] (with the exception of [[Prinzmetal's angina|variant angina]])
* [[Tachyarrhythmia]]
* [[Myocardial infarction]]
* [[Tachycardia]] (and other [[sympathetic nervous system]] symptoms, such as [[muscle tremor]]) associated with various conditions, including [[anxiety]], [[panic]], [[hyperthyroidism]], and [[lithium pharmacology|lithium therapy]]
* [[Portal hypertension]], to lower [[Hepatic portal vein|portal vein]] pressure
* Prevention of [[esophageal varices|esophageal variceal]] bleeding and [[ascites]]
* [[Anxiety]]
* [[Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]]

While once a first-line treatment for [[hypertension]], the role for beta blockers was downgraded in June 2006 in the [[United Kingdom]] to fourth-line, as they do not perform as well as other drugs, particularly in the elderly, and evidence is increasing that the most frequently used beta blockers at usual doses carry an unacceptable risk of provoking [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Sheetal Ladva | title=NICE and BHS launch updated hypertension guideline | url=http://www.nice.org.uk/download.aspx?o=335988 | date=28 June 2006 | publisher=[[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] | accessdate=11 October 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924003311/http://www.nice.org.uk/download.aspx?o=335988 | archivedate=24 September 2006 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Ethical and legal questions have been raised surrounding the use of propranolol-based medications for use as a "memory damper", including: altering memory-recalled evidence during an investigation, modifying behavioral response to past (albeit traumatic) experiences, the regulation of these drugs, and others.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Kolber, Adam J.| title=Therapeutic Forgetting: The Legal and Ethical Implications of Memory Dampening |journal=Vanderbilt Law Review, San Diego Legal Studies Paper No. 07-37. |volume=59 |page=1561 |year=2006}}</ref> However, Hall and Carter have argued that many such objections are "based on wildly exaggerated and unrealistic scenarios that ignore the limited action of propranolol in affecting memory, underplay the debilitating impact that PTSD has on those who suffer from it, and fail to acknowledge the extent to which drugs like alcohol are already used for this purpose."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hall|first=Wayne|author2=Carter, Adrian  | title=Debunking Alarmist Objections to the Pharmacological Prevention of PTSD |journal=American Journal of Bioethics|year=2007|volume=7|issue=9|pages=23–25|doi=10.1080/15265160701551244}}</ref>

Propranolol may be used to treat severe infantile [[hemangiomas]] (IHs). This treatment shows promise as being superior to [[corticosteroid]]s when treating IHs. Extensive clinical case evidence and a small controlled trial support its efficacy.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Current Dermatology Reports |year= 2012 |doi= 10.1007/s13671-012-0026-6 |title= Propranolol for Infantile Hemangiomas: A Review |first1= M. |last1= Hogeling |page= Online-first |volume=1}}</ref>

==Contraindications==
{{See also|Beta blocker#Contraindications}}
Propranolol may be contraindicated in people with:<ref name="Rossi" />

* Reversible airways diseases, particularly [[asthma]] or [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD)
* [[Bradycardia]] (<60 beats/minute)
* [[Sick sinus syndrome]]
* [[Atrioventricular block]] ([[Second-degree atrioventricular block|second-]] or [[Third-degree atrioventricular block|third-degree]])
* [[Shock (circulatory)|Shock]]
* Severe [[hypotension]]
* [[Cocaine intoxication|Cocaine toxicity]] [per American Heart Association guidelines, 2005]

==Adverse effects==
{{See also|Beta blocker#Adverse effects}}

Propranolol should be used with caution in people with:<ref name="Rossi">Rossi S, editor. [[Australian Medicines Handbook]] 2006. Adelaide: Australian Medicines Handbook; 2006.</ref>

* [[Diabetes mellitus]] or [[hyperthyroidism]], since signs and symptoms of [[hypoglycaemia]] may be masked
* [[Peripheral vascular disease]] and [[Raynaud's syndrome]], which may be exacerbated
* [[Phaeochromocytoma]], as [[hypertension]] may be aggravated without prior [[alpha blocker]] therapy
* [[Myasthenia gravis]], which may be worsened
* Other drugs with [[bradycardia|bradycardic]] effects

====Pregnancy and lactation====
Propranolol, like other beta blockers, is classified as [[pregnancy category]] C in the United States and [[Australian Drug Evaluation Committee|ADEC]] category C in Australia. β-blocking agents in general reduce perfusion of the placenta which may lead to adverse outcomes for the [[neonate]], including [[human lung|pulmonary]] or [[human heart|cardiac]] complications, or premature birth. The newborn may experience additional adverse effects such as [[hypoglycemia]] and [[bradycardia]].<ref name="Martindale">{{Cite book|editor=Sweetman, Sean C. |chapter=Cardiovascular Drugs|title=[[Martindale: The complete drug reference]] |edition=36th |year=2009|pages=1226–1381|publisher=Pharmaceutical Press |location=London|isbn=978-0-85369-840-1}}</ref>

Most β-blocking agents appear in the milk of [[lactation|lactating]] women. However, propranolol is highly [[plasma protein binding|bound to proteins in the bloodstream]] and is distributed into breast milk at very low levels.<ref name="LactMed">[No authors listed] (2007). "Propranolol". In: ''Drugs and Lactation Database.'' U.S. [[National Library of Medicine]] Toxicology Data Network. Retrieved 25 February 2013.</ref> These low levels are not expected to pose any risk to the breastfeeding infant, and the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] considers propranolol therapy "generally compatible with breastfeeding".<ref name="Martindale"/><ref name="LactMed"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=[No authors listed] |title=Transfer of drugs and other chemicals into human milk |journal=Pediatrics |volume=108 |issue=3 |pages=776–89 |date=September 2001 |pmid=11533352}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Spencer JP, Gonzalez LS, Barnhart DJ |title=Medications in the breast-feeding mother |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=119–26 |date=July 2001 |pmid=11456429}}</ref>

Due to the high penetration across the [[blood–brain barrier]], [[lipophilic]] beta blockers such as propranolol and [[metoprolol]] are more likely than other less lipophilic beta blockers to cause sleep disturbances such as [[insomnia]] and [[vivid dream]]s, and [[nightmare]]s.<ref name="pmid21180298">{{cite journal |author=Cruickshank JM |title=Beta-blockers and heart failure |journal=Indian Heart J |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=101–10 |year=2010 |pmid=21180298 }}</ref> Dreaming (rapid eye movement sleep, REM) was reduced and increased awakening.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Beta-blockers and sleep: a controlled trial |vauthors=Betts TA, Alford C |journal=Eur J Clin Pharmacol |year=1985 |volume=28 |pmid=2865152  |pages=65–8 |doi=10.1007/bf00543712}}</ref>

[[Adverse drug reaction]]s associated with propranolol therapy are similar to other lipophilic [[beta blocker]]s.

==Interactions==
Since beta blockers are known to relax the cardiac muscle and to constrict the smooth muscle, beta-adrenergic antagonists, including propranolol, have an additive effect with other drugs which decrease blood pressure, or which decrease cardiac contractility or conductivity. Clinically significant interactions particularly occur with:<ref name="Rossi" />

Propranolol is classified as a non-cardioselective sympatholytic [[beta blocker]] that crosses the [[blood–brain barrier]]. It is lipid soluble and also has sodium channel blocking effects. Propranolol is a non-selective [[beta blocker]]; that is, it [[receptor antagonist|blocks]] the action of [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline) and [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline) at both [[Beta-1 adrenergic receptor|β<sub>1</sub>-]] and [[Beta-2 adrenergic receptor|β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor]]s. It has little [[Beta blocker#Intrinsic sympathomimetic activity|intrinsic sympathomimetic activity]], but has strong [[membrane stabilizing effect|membrane stabilizing activity]] (only at high blood concentrations, e.g. [[overdose]]).{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Propranolol is able to cross the blood–brain barrier and exert effects in the [[central nervous system]] in addition to its peripheral activity.<ref name="Steenenvan Wijk2015">{{cite journal|last1=Steenen|first1=S.

In addition to blockade of [[adrenergic receptor]]s, propranolol has very weak inhibitory effects on the [[norepinephrine transporter]] and/or weakly stimulates norepinephrine release (i.e., the concentration of norepinephrine is increased in the [[synapse]]).<ref name="YoungGlennon2008">{{cite journal|last1=Young|first1=Richard|last2=Glennon|first2=Richard A.|title=S(−)Propranolol as a discriminative stimulus and its comparison to the stimulus effects of cocaine in rats|journal=Psychopharmacology|volume=203|issue=2|year=2008|pages=369–382|issn=0033-3158|doi=10.1007/s00213-008-1317-2|pmid=18795268}}</ref><ref name="pmid2872325"/> Since propranolol blocks β-adrenoceptors, the increase in synaptic norepinephrine only results in α-adrenoceptor activation, with the [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor]] being particularly important for effects observed in [[animal model]]s.<ref name="YoungGlennon2008" /><ref name="pmid2872325" /> Therefore, it can be looked upon as a weak indirect α<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor [[agonist]] in addition to potent β-adrenoceptor antagonist.<ref name="YoungGlennon2008" /><ref name="pmid2872325" /> In addition to its effects on the adrenergic system, there is evidence that indicates that propranolol may act as a weak [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of certain [[serotonin receptor]]s, namely the [[5-HT1A|5-HT<sub>1A</sub>]], [[5-HT1B receptor|5-HT<sub>1B</sub>]], and [[5-HT2B receptor|5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor]]s.<ref name="pmid9064274">{{cite journal | vauthors = Davids E, Lesch KP | title = [The 5-HT1A receptor: a new effective principle in psychopharmacologic therapy?] | language = German | journal = Fortschr Neurol Psychiatr | volume = 64 | issue = 11 | pages = 460–72 | year = 1996 | pmid = 9064274 | doi = 10.1055/s-2007-996592 | url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid7938165">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoyer D, Clarke DE, Fozard JR, Hartig PR, Martin GR, Mylecharane EJ, Saxena PR, Humphrey PP | title = International Union of Pharmacology classification of receptors for 5-hydroxytryptamine (Serotonin) | journal = Pharmacol.

Both enantiomers of propranolol have a [[local anesthetic]] (topical) effect, which is normally mediated by blockade of [[voltage-gated sodium channel]]s. Studies have demonstrated propranolol's ability to block cardiac, neuronal, and skeletal voltage-gated sodium channels, accounting for its known membrane stabilizing effect and antiarrhythmic and other central nervous system effects.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Wang D.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Propranolol is rapidly and completely absorbed, with peak plasma levels achieved about 1–3 hours after ingestion. Coadministration with food appears to enhance [[bioavailability]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rang|first1=Humphrey P.|title=Rang & Dale's pharmacology|date=2011|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Edinburgh|isbn=9780702034718|page=106|edition=7th}}</ref> Despite complete absorption, propranolol has a  variable [[bioavailability]] due to extensive [[first-pass metabolism]]. [[Hepatic]] impairment therefore increases its bioavailability. The main metabolite 4-hydroxypropranolol, with a longer [[half-life]] (5.2–7.5 hours) than the parent compound (3–4 hours), is also pharmacologically active.

Propranolol is a highly [[lipophilic]] drug achieving high concentrations in the brain. The duration of action of a single oral dose is longer than the half-life and may be up to 12 hours, if the single dose is high enough (e.g., 80&nbsp;mg). Effective plasma concentrations are between 10 and 100&nbsp;mg/l.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Toxic levels are associated with plasma concentrations above 2000&nbsp;mg/l.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==History==
{{Main article|Discovery and development of beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (beta-blockers)}}

[[British people|British]] scientist [[James W. Black]] developed propranolol in the 1960s.<ref name="Black JW, Crowther AF, Shanks RG, Smith LH, Dornhorst AC 1964 1080–1081">{{cite journal|vauthors=Black JW, Crowther AF, Shanks RG, Smith LH, Dornhorst AC |title=A new adrenergic betareceptor antagonist | journal=[[The Lancet]] |volume=283 |issue=7342 |pages=1080–1081 |year=1964 |pmid=14132613 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(64)91275-9}}</ref> In 1988, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]] for this discovery. Propranolol was inspired by the early β-adrenergic antagonists [[dichloroisoprenaline]] and [[pronethalol]]. The key difference, which was carried through to essentially all subsequent beta blockers, was the inclusion of an oxymethylene group (-O-CH<sub>2</sub>-) between the [[aryl]] and [[ethanolamine]] moieties of pronethalol, greatly increasing the potency of the compound. This also apparently eliminated the [[carcinogenicity]] found with pronethalol in animal models.

Newer, more cardio-selective beta blockers (such as [[bisoprolol]], [[nebivolol]], [[carvedilol]], or [[metoprolol]]) are now used in the treatment of [[hypertension]].

==Society and culture==
In a 1987 study by the International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians, 27% of interviewed members admitted to using beta blockers such as propranolol for musical performances.<ref name= Fishbein>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fishbein M, Middlestadt SE, Ottati V, Straus S, Ellis A | year = 1988 | title = Medical problems among ICSOM musicians: overview of a national survey | journal = Med Probl Perform Artist | volume = 3| pages = 1–8}}</ref> For about 10–16% of performers, their degree of stage fright is considered pathological.<ref name= Fishbein/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Steptoe A, Malik F, Pay C, Pearson P, Price C, Win Z | year = 1995 | title = The impact of stage fright on student actors | journal = Br J Psychol | volume = 86| pages = 27–39 | doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1995.tb02544.x}}</ref> Propranolol is used by musicians, actors, and public speakers for its ability to treat anxiety symptoms activated by the sympathetic nervous system.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Alan H.

===Brand names===
Original propranolol was marketed in 1965 under the brand name Inderal and manufactured by [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI Pharmaceuticals]] (now [[AstraZeneca]]). Propranolol is also marketed under brand names Avlocardyl, Deralin, Dociton, Inderalici, InnoPran XL, Sumial, Anaprilin, and Bedranol SR ([[Sandoz]]). In India it is marketed under brand names such as Ciplar and Ciplar LA by [[Cipla]]. Hemangeol, a 4.28&nbsp;mg/mL solution of propranolol, is indicated for the treatment of proliferating infantile hemangioma.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hemangeol - Food and Drug Administration|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/205410s000lbl.pdf|accessdate=23 March 2015|date=1 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402113709/https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/205410s000lbl.pdf|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
