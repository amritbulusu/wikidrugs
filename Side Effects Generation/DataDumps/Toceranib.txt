It was developed by [[SUGEN]] as SU11654,<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/24/business/24cancer.html In Trials for New Cancer Drugs, Family Pets Are Benefiting, Too, New York Times]</ref> a sister compound to [[sunitinib]], which was later approved for human therapies. Toceranib is likely to act mostly through inhibition of the [[C-kit|kit]] tyrosine kinase, though it may also have an [[Angiogenesis inhibitor|anti-angiogenic]] effect.
