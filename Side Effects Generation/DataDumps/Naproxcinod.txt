'''Naproxcinod''' ('''nitronaproxen''') is a [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] (NSAID) developed by the French pharmaceutical company [[NicOx]]. It is a [[derivative (chemistry)|derivative]] of [[naproxen]] with a nitroxybutyl [[ester]] to allow it to also act as a [[nitric oxide]] (NO) donor. This second [[mechanism of action]] makes naproxcinod the first in a new class of drugs, the [[cyclooxygenase inhibiting nitric oxide donator]]s (CINODs), that are hoped to produce similar [[analgesic]] efficacy to traditional NSAIDs, but with less gastrointestinal and cardiovascular side effects.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = JL | last2 = Augustyniak | first2 = ME | last3 = Cochran | first3 = ED | last4 = Earl | first4 = RA | last5 = Garvey | first5 = DS | last6 = Gordon | first6 = LJ | last7 = Janero | first7 = DR | last8 = Khanapure | first8 = SP | last9 = Letts | first9 = LG | last10 = Melim | first10 = Terry L. | last11 = Murty | first11 = Madhavi G. | last12 = Schwalb | first12 = David J. | last13 = Shumway | first13 = Matthew J. | last14 = Selig | first14 = William M. | last15 = Trocha | first15 = A.

On December 2006, ''[[Scientific American]]'' distinguished naproxcinod as one of the ten most promising treatments for the world's biggest health threats;<ref>[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=special-report-10-promisi, ''Special Report: 10 Promising Treatments for World's Biggest Health Threats'', By Charles Q. Choi. 2006]</ref> however, in 2010 the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] determined that further clinical trials would be needed to obtain approval.<ref name=FDA-2010/>

==Current situation in pain treatment==
Many people are currently relying on traditional NSAIDs and [[COX-2 inhibitor]]s (for example [[celecoxib]]) to treat [[chronic pain]] and [[inflammation]]. COX-2 inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular events such as [[stroke]]s or [[heart attack]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Baron | first1 = JA | last2 = Sandler | first2 = RS | last3 = Bresalier | first3 = RS | last4 = Lanas | first4 = A | last5 = Morton | first5 = DG | last6 = Riddell | first6 = R | last7 = Iverson | first7 = ER | last8 = Demets | first8 = DL | title = Cardiovascular events associated with rofecoxib: final analysis of the APPROVe trial | journal = Lancet | volume = 372 | issue = 9651 | pages = 1756–64 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18922570 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61490-7}}</ref> Therefore, there is an unmet need for safer medications. This need is particularly acute among patients with high cardiovascular risk like hypertension which represents 50% of osteoarthritis sufferers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==Indications==
Three phase III [[clinical trial]]s led by NicOx have shown that naproxcinod was effective to treat pain against knee [[osteoarthritis]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.drugs.com/clinical_trials/nicox-announces-top-line-results-naproxcinod-52-week-301-safety-extension-5157.html|title=NicOx Announces Top-Line Results From Naproxcinod 52-Week 301 Safety Extension|date=24 July 2008|accessdate=2 February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00542555|Analgesic Efficacy and Safety Study of Naproxcinod in Subjects With Osteoarthritis of the Knee}}</ref><ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00504127|Efficacy and Safety Study of Naproxcinod in Subjects With Osteoarthritis of the Knee}}</ref> and hip osteoarthrtis.<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00541489|Efficacy and Safety Study of Naproxcinod in Subjects With Osteoarthritis of the Hip}}</ref> A phase II study showed no significant differences in [[efficacy]] between naproxcinod and the COX-2 inhibitor [[rofecoxib]] in the treatment of pain.<ref name="Karlsson">{{cite journal | last1 = Karlsson | first1 = J | last2 = Pivodic | first2 = A | last3 = Aguirre | first3 = D | last4 = Schnitzer | first4 = TJ | title = Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the cyclooxygenase-inhibiting nitric oxide donator naproxcinod in treating osteoarthritis of the hip or knee | journal = The Journal of rheumatology | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 1290–7 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19411388 | doi = 10.3899/jrheum.081011}}</ref>

In osteoarthritis, a 750&nbsp;mg dose is equipotent to 500&nbsp;mg of naproxen for the treatment of inflammation but with the added benefit of attenuating the cardiovascular effects traditionally associated with NSAIDs.<ref name="White">{{cite journal |vauthors=White WB, Schnitzer TJ, Fleming R, Duquesroix B, Beekman M |title=Effects of the cyclooxygenase inhibiting nitric oxide donator naproxcinod versus naproxen on systemic blood pressure in patients with osteoarthritis |journal=Am.

In July 2010 the FDA decided not to approve naproxcinod.<ref name=FDA-2010>[http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/nicox-shares-plummet-as-fda-says-osteoarthritis-drug-not-ready-for-approval/81243699/ NicOx Shares Plummet as FDA Says Osteoarthritis Drug Not Ready for Approval]</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Naproxcinoid is metabolized to naproxen and a nitric oxide donating [[moiety (chemistry)|moiety]]. NO has various cardiovascular effects, including [[vasodilatory]] and [[Antiplatelet drug|platelet-inhibitory]] actions as well as the inhibition of [[vascular smooth muscle]] [[Cell growth|proliferation]] that serves to maintain normal vascular tone.<ref name="White" />

==Safety profile==

===Blood pressure profile===
According to some experts{{Who|date=October 2009}}, cardiovascular risks induced by COX-2 inhibitors are caused by increases in blood pressure. Naproxcinod demonstrated in a clinical trial with 916 patients to have a blood pressure profile similar to [[placebo]].<ref name="White" /> Two phase II randomized controlled trials have shown a decreased systolic blood pressure by 2.1 [[mmHg]] after patients took naproxcinod (375&nbsp;mg or 750&nbsp;mg twice daily) for six weeks.  These effects were especially pronounced in hypertensive populations.<ref name="Karlsson" /><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Wallace | first1 = JL | last2 = Viappiani | first2 = S | last3 = Bolla | first3 = M | title = Cyclooxygenase-inhibiting nitric oxide donators for osteoarthritis | journal = Trends in pharmacological sciences | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 112–7 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19230986 | doi = 10.1016/j.tips.2009.01.001}}</ref>

====Clinical relevance of small increase in blood pressure====
During an [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) COX-2 advisory committee meeting, doctors have underlined the important role of small increase in blood pressure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masterdocs.com/PDF/Analysis%20of%20FDA%20COX-2%20Advisory%20Committee%20Meeting.pdf|title=Analysis of FDA COX-2 Advisory Committee Meeting|year=2005|page=21}}</ref> They cited the ''CAMELOT'' trial which has concluded that even a small decrease in systolic blood pressure of 5 mmHg could lead to a reduction of 31% in cardiovascular events.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1001/jama.292.18.2217|title=Effect of Antihypertensive Agents on Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Coronary Disease and Normal Blood Pressure|first9=E|last10=Topol|first10=Eric J.|last11=Camelot Investigators|first11=for the|last9=Buebendorf|first8=H|last8=Shi|first7=L|last7=Berman|first6=D|last6=Garza|first5=M|last5=Ghali|first4=PD|last4=Thompson|first3=P|last3=Libby|journal=JAMA|first2=EM|year=2004|volume=292|last2=Tuzcu|issue=18|pages=2217–25|last1=Nissen|first1=Steven E|pmid=15536108|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/292/18/2217|display-authors=8}}</ref> Clinical studies about rofecoxib have shown that this drug increases the systolic blood pressure.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Whelton | first1 = A | title = COX-2-specific inhibitors and the kidney: effect on hypertension and oedema | journal = Journal of Hypertension Supplement | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = S31–5 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12683425}}</ref>

A 2005 analysis shows that a blood pressure decrease of 3.1 mmHG could avoid over 30,000 deaths from stroke and 2,000 deaths from [[coronary disease]], resulting in more than 449,000 [[person year]]s of life saved and 1.4 billion [[US$]] in direct health care cost savings.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Grover | first1=SA | last2=Coupal | first2=L | last3=Zowall | first3=H | title=Treating osteoarthritis with cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitors: what are the benefits of avoiding blood pressure destabilization? | journal=Hypertension | volume=45 | issue=1 | pages=92–7 | year=2005 | pmid=15545508 | doi=10.1161/01.HYP.0000149684.01903.b8}}</ref>

===Gastrointestinal safety===
NSAIDs have also been associated with [[gastrointestinal]] risks such as bleedings. Early studies demonstrated that naproxcinod had a better gastrointestinal profile than naproxen, especially for the [[gastroduodenal]] mucosa,<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Wilder-Smith | first1=CH | last2=Jonzon | first2=B | last3=Fornstedt-Wallin | first3=B | last4=Hedman | first4=A | last5=Karlsson | first5=P | title=Dose-effect comparisons of the CINOD AZD3582 and naproxen on upper gastrointestinal tract mucosal injury in healthy subjects | journal=Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology | volume=41 | issue=3 | pages=264–73 | year=2006 | pmid=16497612 | doi=10.1080/00365520510024197}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1=Hawkey | first1=CJ | last2=Jones | first2=JI | last3=Atherton | first3=CT | last4=Skelly | first4=MM | last5=Bebb | first5=JR | last6=Fagerholm | first6=U | last7=Jonzon | first7=B | last8=Karlsson | first8=P | last9=Bjarnason | first9=IT | title=Gastrointestinal safety of AZD3582, a cyclooxygenase inhibiting nitric oxide donator: proof of concept study in humans | journal=Gut | volume=52 | issue=11 | pages=1537–42 | year=2003 | pmid=14570719 | pmc=1773862 | doi=10.1136/gut.52.11.1537 }}</ref> but a 2009 review has found only a slight and possibly not clinically relevant reduction of gastrointestinal side-effects.<ref name="Geusens">{{cite journal | last1=Geusens | first1=P | title=Naproxcinod, a new cyclooxygenase-inhibiting nitric oxide donator (CINOD) | journal=Expert opinion on biological therapy | volume=9 | issue=5 | pages=649–57 | year=2009 | pmid=19392579 | doi=10.1517/14712590902926071}}</ref><ref name="Zsilavecz">Schubert-Zsilavecz, M, Wurglics, M, ''Neue Arzneimittel 2010''</ref>

==Contraindications and adverse effects==
{{Expand section|date=October 2009}}
Similarly to NSAIDs, adverse effects of naproxcinod include gastrointestinal bleedings.<ref name="Geusens" /><ref name="Zsilavecz" />

==Commercialization==

Naproxcinod completed a phase III study needed for a [[New Drug Application]] (NDA). As a result, Nicox submitted its project to the FDA in September 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSB40902120090925|title=NicOx submits naproxcinod application to FDA|publisher=Reuters|date=25 September 2009|accessdate=3 February 2010 | first=Marcel | last=Michelson}}</ref> In July 2010, the FDA decided not to approve naproxcinod without further clinical trials.<ref name="FDA-2010" />  Nicox submitted a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMEA) in December 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.silobreaker.com/maa-for-naproxcinod-submitted-to-emea-through-centralized-procedure-5_2262826292887945243|title=MAA for naproxcinod submitted to EMEA through centralized procedure|publisher=NewsMedical.net|date=22 December 2009|accessdate=2 February 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  Nicox and Fera Pharmaceuticals announced in November 2015 that they had entered into a license agreement for the development and commercialization of naproxcinod in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ferapharma.com/press-releases|title=Fera Pharmaceuticals - Press Releases|website=www.ferapharma.com|access-date=2016-04-20}}</ref>
