'''Dopexamine''' is a synthetic analogue of [[dopamine]] that is administered intravenously in hospitals to reduce exacerbations of [[heart failure]] and to treat heart failure following [[cardiac surgery]].  It is not used often, as more established drugs like [[epinephrine]], [[dopamine]], [[dobutamine]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[levosimendan]] work as well.  It works by stimulating [[beta-2 adrenergic receptors]] and peripheral [[dopamine receptor D1]] and [[dopamine receptor D2]]. It also inhibits of neuronal re-uptake of [[norepinephrine]]

The most common adverse effects include [[tachycardia|fast heart beats]] and nausea.

It was discovered by scientists at [[Fisons]], which licensed it to [[Ipsen]] in 1993, and Ipsen in turn licensed it to [[Élan]] in 1999. Ipsen licensed rights in North America and Japan to Circassia in 2008; the drug had never been approved in those countries.    Dopexamine went off-patent in 2010.

== Medical use ==
Dopexamine is used in hospitals as an [[Inotrope|inotropic agent]] to reduce exacerbations of [[heart failure]] and to treat heart failure following [[cardiac surgery]].<ref name="pmid12740229">{{cite journal|date=May 2003|title=Dopexamine, dobutamine, and dopamine increase splanchnic blood flow: what is the evidence?|url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12740229|journal=Chest|volume=123|issue=5 Suppl|pages=460S–3S|doi=10.1378/chest.123.5_suppl.460S|pmid=12740229|author=Lisbon A}}</ref><ref name=UKlabel2015>{{cite web|title=UK Dopacard label|url=https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/28985|publisher=UK Electronic Medicines Compendium|date=July 13, 2015}}</ref><ref name=Fitton1990rev/>  It is administered intravenuously.<ref name=UKlabel2015/>

As of 2010 dopexamine was not often administered in cardiac care because other, more well established drugs can accomplish the same effect, other such drugs include [[epinephrine]], [[dopamine]], [[dobutamine]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[levosimendan]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tagarakis|first=Georgios I.|last2=Stylianakis|first2=Georgios E.|last3=Tsilimingas|first3=Nikolaos B.|date=2010-01-01|title=Dopexamine after heart surgery: an uncommonly used, though useful inotropic agent|journal=Recent Patents on Cardiovascular Drug Discovery|volume=5|issue=1|pages=66–68|pmid=19929847|doi=10.2174/157489010790192593}}</ref>

It should not be used in people taking [[monoamine oxidase inhibitors]], nor in people who have certain [[Pheochromocytoma|adrenal cancers]], [[thrombocytopenia|low platelet counts]], or people with left [[Ventricular outflow tract obstruction|ventricular outlet obstruction]].<ref name=UKlabel2015/>

It also should not be used in people with severe [[hypotension|low blood pressure]] or reduced systemic vascular resistance. It should be used in caution in people with ischemic heart disease especially following heart attack or  a recent episode of [[angina]] due to the risk of tachycardia.  It should not be used in people with [[hypovolemia|reduced blood volume]].<ref name=UKlabel2015/>

Safety in pregnant women has not been established.<ref name=UKlabel2015/>

== Adverse effects ==
Very common (greater than 10%) adverse effects include [[tachycardia|fast heart beats]] and nausea.<ref name=UKlabel2015/>
Common (between 1% and 10%) adverse effects include tremor, headache, transient [[hypotension|low blood pressure]], vomiting, increased sweating, sepsis, sinus and nodal [[bradycardia|slow heart beat]], cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, cardiac enzyme changes, non-specific ECG changes, [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]], hemorrhage, respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary edema, pulmonary hypertension, and kidney failure.<ref name=UKlabel2015/>

Like other ß2-agonists, dopexamine lowers potassium levels and raises glucose levels, so there is a risk of exacerbating [[hypokalaemia]] or [[hyperglycaemia]].<ref name=UKlabel2015/>

People can develop [[drug tolerance]] to dopexamine if it is administered over a long period of time, as with other  catecholamines.<ref name=UKlabel2015/>

Dopexamine may potentiate the effects of other catecholamines like [[noradrenaline]].    Effects of depexamine may be suppressed by concomitant use with  ß2-adrenergic and dopamine receptor antagonists requires caution.<ref name=UKlabel2015/>

== Pharmacology ==
The half-life of IV dopexamine is 6–7 minutes in healthy adults and 11 minutes in patients with heart failure.<ref name=UKlabel2015/>

===Mechanism of action===
Dopexamine stimulates [[beta-2 adrenergic receptors]] and peripheral [[dopamine receptor D1]] and [[dopamine receptor D2]]. It also inhibits of neuronal re-uptake of [[norepinephrine]] (Uptake-1).  These activities increase cardiac output and increase blood flow to peripheral vascular beds.<ref name=UKlabel2015/><ref name=Fitton1990rev>{{Cite journal|last=Fitton|first=A.|last2=Benfield|first2=P.|date=1990-02-01|title=Dopexamine hydrochloride.

As of 2004 there was some controversy surrounding the mechanism of dopexamine.  Some held that its local effects of increased tissue perfusion were due only to increased output from the heart, while others held that were direct peripheral effects.<ref name=ESA2004>{{cite web|last1=Meier-Hellmann|first1=Andreas|last2=Vlasakov|first2=Kamen|title=Management of Sepsis|publisher=European Society of Anaesthesiologists|date=June 5, 2004}}</ref>

Dopexamine was discovered by scientists at [[Fisons]]<ref name=R&Dnews1999>{{cite news|title=Dopexamine Elan, Beaufour Ipsen licensing agreement|work=R & D Focus Drug News|date=May 17, 1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=RA|last2=et al|title=Dopexamine: a novel agonist at peripheral dopamine receptors and beta 2-adrenoceptors.|journal=British Journal of Pharmacology|date=July 1985|volume=85|issue=3|pages=599–608|pmid=2862944|pmc=1916510|doi=10.1111/j.1476-5381.1985.tb10554.x}}</ref>  and Fisons received the USAN name dopexamine in 1985 for its compound, then called FPL 60278.<ref name=USAN1985/>

The drug was marketed by 1992<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Leier|first1=CV|title=Current status of non-digitalis positive inotropic drugs.|journal=The American journal of cardiology|date=4 June 1992|volume=69|issue=18|pages=120G-128G; disc. 128G-129G|pmid=1352656}}</ref> and by 1996 had been approved in several countries.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Leier|first1=CV|title=Positive inotropic therapy: an update and new agents.|journal=Current problems in cardiology|date=August 1996|volume=21|issue=8|pages=521–81|pmid=8872411|doi=10.1016/s0146-2806(96)80002-8}}</ref>

Fisons licensed the rights to [[Ipsen]] in 1993, and Ipsen in turn licensed the rights to Elan in 1999.<ref name=R&Dnews1999/>

The patent on dopexamine was controlled by Elan when it expired in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|title=PPRS: The Study into the Extent of Competition in the Supply of Branded Medicines to the NHS|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/documents/digitalasset/dh_4067318.pdf|publisher=Department of Health and the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http:/www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/documents/digitalasset/dh_4067318.pdf|archivedate=January 7, 2013|date=December 2002|page=143}}</ref>

Dopexamine was approved for use in the European Union for treatment of symptoms related to heart failure in 2010.<ref name=UKlabel2015/>

In 2008 the UK company Circassia acquired the US, Canadian, and Japanese marketing rights to dopexamine from Ipsen; at the time, the company said it  was planning to develop a new formulation of dopexamine in combination with fluids delivered via IV fluids, looking to improve outcomes following surgery.<ref name=PT2008/> As of 2008 dopexamine had not been approved for any use in the US, Canada, or Japan.<ref name=PT2008>{{cite news|title=Circassia gets rights to dopexamine from Ipsen|url=http://www.pharmatimes.com/news/circassia_gets_rights_to_dopexamine_from_ipsen_986641|work=Pharma Times|date=9 October 2008|language=en}}</ref> A

Teva recalled batches of dopexamine in the UK in 2014 due to quality control issues by the manufacturer, Cephalon.<ref>{{cite news|title=MHRA CLDA Company-Led Drug Alert - Dopacard 50mg/5ml Concentrate for Solution in 5ml vials - Cephalon UK Limited - CLDA (14)A/16|url=http://trackregulatory.blogspot.com/2014/09/mhra-clda-company-led-drug-alert.html|work=Track Regulatory|date=15 September 2014}}</ref>

== Research ==
Use in [[sepsis]] has been explored in clinical trials, but use of an inotropic agent like [[dobutamine]] or dopexamine did not reduce mortality compared with [[norepinephrine]] or [[epinephrine]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Oba|first1=Y|last2=Lone|first2=NA|title=Mortality benefit of vasopressor and inotropic agents in septic shock: a Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.|journal=Journal of critical care|date=October 2014|volume=29|issue=5|pages=706–10|pmid=24857641|doi=10.1016/j.jcrc.2014.04.011}}</ref>  Use of dopexamine may be harmful in sepsis <ref name=ESA2004/>
