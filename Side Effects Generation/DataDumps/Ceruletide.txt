'''Ceruletide''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]), also known as '''cerulein''' or '''caerulein''', is a ten amino acid [[oligopeptide]] that stimulates [[smooth muscle]] and increases digestive secretions.  Ceruletide is similar in action and composition to [[cholecystokinin]]. It stimulates gastric, biliary, and pancreatic secretion; and certain smooth muscle. It is used in paralytic ileus and as diagnostic aid in pancreatic malfunction.  It is used to induce [[pancreatitis]] in experimental animal models.

Ceruletide was discovered and its structure elucidated in 1967 by Australian and Italian scientists from dried skins of the [[Australian green tree frog]] (''Litoria caerulea'', formerly ''Hyla caerulea'').  Its amino acid sequence is Pglu-Gln-Asp-Tyr[SO<sub>3</sub>H]-Thr-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH<sub>2</sub>.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF02154119 |author1=A. Anastasi |author2=V.

== Induction of pancreatitis ==
Ceruletide upregulates pancreatic [[acinar cell]] [[intercellular adhesion molecule-1]] (ICAM-1) proteins through intracellular upregulation of [[NF-κB]].  Surface ICAM-1 in turn promotes neutrophil adhesion onto acinar cells enhancing pancreatic [[inflammation]].<ref>{{Cite journal |author1=V. Zaninovic |author2=A. S. Gukovskaya |author3=I.

Ceruletide also activates [[NADPH oxidase]], a source of reactive oxygen species contributing to inflammation, as well as the [[Janus kinase]]/signal transducer, another inflammation inducer.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.5009/gnl.2008.2.2.74 | author = H.
