===Cancer===
An increase in formation of [[adenocarcinoma]]s was observed in rats during preclinical trials; however, the clinical significance of these results remains undetermined.

==Overdose==
Through excessive ingestion, accidental or otherwise, persons may experience overdose symptoms including drowsiness, sedation, blurred vision, slurred speech, somnolence and possibly death, if a very high amount was taken, particularly if combined with alcohol. For overdose considerations, serum gabapentin concentrations may be measured for confirmation.<ref>R.C.

Gabapentin is best known under the brand name Neurontin manufactured by [[Pfizer]] subsidiary Parke-Davis. A Pfizer subsidiary named Greenstone markets generic gabapentin.

In December 2004 the FDA granted final approval to a generic equivalent to Neurontin made by the Israeli firm [[Teva Pharmaceutical Industries|Teva]].

Neurontin began as one of Pfizer's best selling drugs; however, Pfizer was criticized and under litigation for its marketing of the drug. They faced allegations that Parke-Davis marketed the drug for at least a dozen supposed uses that the [[David Franklin (scientist)|FDA]] had not approved.<ref name="pmid16908923" /><ref>{{cite press release |url = http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2004/May/04_civ_322.htm |title = Warner–Lambert to pay $430&nbsp;million to resolve criminal & civil health care liability relating to off-label promotion |publisher = [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] |date = 13 May 2004 |accessdate = 2 December 2009 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090717111709/http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2004/May/04_civ_322.htm |archivedate = 17 July 2009 |df = }}</ref> It has been used as a mainstay drug for migraines, even though it was not approved for such use in 2004.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Mathew |first1 = NT |last2 = Rapoport |first2 = A |last3 = Saper |first3 = J |last4 = Magnus |first4 = L |last5 = Klapper |first5 = J |last6 = Ramadan |first6 = N |last7 = Stacey |first7 = B |last8 = Tepper |first8 = S |title = Efficacy of Gabapentin in Migraine Prophylaxis |journal = [[Headache (journal)|Headache: the Journal of Head and Face Pain]] |volume = 41 |issue = 2 |pages = 119–28 |date = February 2001 |pmid = 11251695 |doi = 10.1046/j.1526-4610.2001.111006119.x |url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1526-4610.2001.111006119.x/pdf |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120910234648/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1526-4610.2001.111006119.x/pdf |archivedate = 10 September 2012 |df = }}</ref>

=== FDA approval ===

Gabapentin was originally approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 1993, for use as an adjuvant (effective when added to other antiseizure drugs) medication to control [[focal seizure|partial seizures]] in adults; that indication was extended to children in 2000.<ref name=Mack>{{cite journal |author = Mack A |year = 2003 |title = Examination of the evidence for off-label use of gabapentin |url = http://www.amcp.org/data/jmcp/Contemporary%20Subject-559-568.pdf |format = PDF |journal = J Manag Care Pharm |volume = 9 |issue = 6 |pages = 559–68 |pmid = 14664664 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100917222044/http://amcp.org/data/jmcp/Contemporary%20Subject-559-568.pdf |archivedate = 17 September 2010 |df = }}</ref> In 2004, its use for treating postherpetic neuralgia (neuropathic pain following [[shingles]]) was approved.<ref name=Mack /><ref>Pfizer [http://labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=630 Neurontin Label, Revised: 5/2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810040212/http://labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=630 |date=10 August 2014 }} Retrieved 9 August 2014</ref>

=== Off-label promotion ===

Although some small, non-controlled studies in the 1990s—mostly sponsored by gabapentin's manufacturer—suggested that treatment for bipolar disorder with gabapentin may be promising,<ref name = evid /> the preponderance of evidence suggests that it is not effective.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors = Reinares M, Rosa AR, Franco C, etal |title = A systematic review on the role of anticonvulsants in the treatment of acute bipolar depression |journal = Int.

==== ''Franklin v. Pfizer'' case ====
{{Main|Franklin v. Parke-Davis}}

According to the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', ''off-label'' prescriptions accounted for roughly 90&nbsp;percent of Neurontin sales.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/05/14/BUGKK6L0LB1.DTL |title = Huge penalty in drug fraud, Pfizer settles felony case in Neurontin off-label promotion |work = San Francisco Chronicle |date = 14 May 2004 |page = C-1 |first = Bernadette |last = Tansey |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060623103021/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2004%2F05%2F14%2FBUGKK6L0LB1.DTL |archivedate = 23 June 2006 |df = }}</ref>

While off-label prescriptions are common for a number of drugs and are legal, marketing of off-label uses of a drug is not.<ref name="pmid16908923" /> In 2004, [[Warner-Lambert]] (which subsequently was acquired by Pfizer) agreed to plead guilty for activities of its Parke-Davis subsidiary, and to pay $430&nbsp;million in fines to settle civil and criminal charges regarding the marketing of Neurontin for off-label purposes. The 2004 settlement was [[List of Largest Pharmaceutical Settlements|one of the largest]] in U.S. history, and the [[List of off-label promotion pharmaceutical settlements|first off-label promotion case]] brought successfully under the False Claims Act.

=== Brand names ===

Gabapentin was originally marketed under the brand name Neurontin and since it became generic, it has been marketed under many other brand names.<ref name="Drugs.com" /> An [[extended-release]] formulation of gabapentin for once-daily administration was introduced in 2011 for postherpetic neuralgia under the brand name Gralise.<ref name="Drugs.com-History">https://www.drugs.com/history/gralise.html</ref>
