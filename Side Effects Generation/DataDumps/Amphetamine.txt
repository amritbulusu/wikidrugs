The first amphetamine pharmaceutical was [[History of Benzedrine|Benzedrine]], a brand which was used to treat a variety of conditions.

At therapeutic doses, amphetamine causes emotional and cognitive effects such as [[euphoria]], change in [[libido|desire for sex]], increased [[wakefulness]], and improved [[Executive functions|cognitive control]]. It induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. Larger doses of amphetamine may impair cognitive function and induce [[Rhabdomyolysis|rapid muscle breakdown]]. [[Addiction|Drug addiction]] is a serious risk with large recreational doses but is unlikely to arise from typical long-term medical use at therapeutic doses. Very high doses can result in [[Stimulant psychosis#Amphetamines|psychosis]] (e.g., [[delusion]]s and [[paranoia]]) which rarely occurs at therapeutic doses even during long-term use. Recreational doses are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses and carry a far greater risk of serious side effects.{{#tag:ref|<ref name="Adderall IR" /><ref name="Malenka_2009" /><ref name="Ergogenics" /><ref name="FDA Abuse & OD" /><ref name="Libido" /><ref name="FDA Effects" /><ref name="Westfall" /><ref name="Cochrane" /><ref name="Stimulant Misuse" /><ref name="NHM-Addiction doses" /><ref name="Addiction risk" /><ref name="EncycOfPsychopharm" />|group="sources"}}

Amphetamine belongs to the [[substituted phenethylamine|phenethylamine class]]. It is also the parent compound of its own structural class, the [[substituted amphetamine]]s,{{#tag:ref|The term "amphetamines" also refers to a chemical class, but, unlike the class of substituted amphetamines,<ref name="Substituted amphetamines, FMO, and DBH" /> the "amphetamines" class does not have a standardized definition in academic literature.<ref name="Proper definition" /> One of the more restrictive definitions of this class includes only the racemate and enantiomers of amphetamine and methamphetamine.<ref name="Proper definition" />  The most general definition of the class encompasses a broad range of pharmacologically and structurally related compounds.<ref name="Proper definition" /><br />Due to confusion that may arise from use of the plural form, this article will only use the terms "amphetamine" and "amphetamines" to refer to racemic amphetamine, levoamphetamine, and dextroamphetamine and reserve the term "substituted amphetamines" for its structural class.|group="note"}} which includes prominent substances such as [[bupropion]], [[cathinone]], [[MDMA]], and [[methamphetamine]]. As a member of the phenethylamine class, amphetamine is also chemically related to the naturally occurring [[trace amine]] neuromodulators, specifically [[phenethylamine]] and {{nowrap|[[N-Methylphenethylamine|''N''-methylphenethylamine]]}}, both of which are produced within the human body. Phenethylamine is the parent compound of amphetamine, while {{nowrap|''N''-methylphenethylamine}} is a [[Structural isomer|positional isomer]] of amphetamine that differs only in the placement of the [[methyl group]].{{#tag:ref|<ref name="Trace Amines" /><ref name="EMC">{{cite web | title = Amphetamine | url = http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/drug-profiles/amphetamine | work = European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction | accessdate = 19 October 2013}}</ref><ref name="Amphetamine - a substituted amphetamine" />|group="sources"}}

Key cell populations of the ascending arousal pathway include cholinergic, noradrenergic, serotoninergic, dopaminergic, and histaminergic neurons located in the pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (PPT/LDT), locus coeruleus, dorsal and median raphe nucleus, and tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN), respectively.&nbsp;... The mechanism of action of sympathomimetic alerting drugs (eg, dextro- and methamphetamine, methylphenidate) is direct or indirect stimulation of dopaminergic and noradrenergic nuclei, which in turn heightens the efficacy of the ventral periaqueductal grey area and locus coeruleus, both components of the secondary branch of the ascending arousal system.&nbsp;...

*: Quote from Molecular Neuropharmacology textbook pp. 295: "The ARAS is a complex structure consisting of several different circuits including the four monoaminergic pathways discussed in Chapter 6. The norepinephrine pathway originates from the locus ceruleus (LC) and related brainstem nuclei; the serotonergic neurons originate from the raphe nuclei within the brainstem as well; the dopaminergic neurons originate in ventral tegmental area (VTA); and the histaminergic pathway originates from neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) of the posterior hypothalamus&nbsp;... Norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, and histamine have complex modulatory functions and, in general, promote wakefulness."
** Note: the role that amphetamine's dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic effects play in its therapeutic MoA for narcolepsy is explicitly covered in PMID 23065655

====Obesity====
Topics to cover: 

Amphetamine's therapeutic MoA in the periphery:
* amphetamine-triggered induction of lipolysis via peripheral (nor-)adrenergic signaling in adipose fat cells which induces the release of triglycerides into blood plasma (find citation – this is the only peripheral mechanism of action AFAIK)

Amphetamine's therapeutic MoA in the CNS:
* strong induction of CART mRNA in the hypothalamus, the central regulator of energy homeostasis; "CART promotes physical activity and wakefulness" [PMID 22547886] and markedly inhibits hunger [pubchem amphetamine entry] (pubchem quote: "this anorectic peptide inhibits both normal and starvation-induced feeding and completely blocks the feeding response induced by neuropeptide Y and regulated by leptin in the hypothalamus")

* indicate that every monoamine neurotransmitter is involved in the [[homeostatic control of energy balance]] [cite PMID 22547886 and the refs I added to the "energy homeostasis" article]
** cover the systems neurobiology of the monoaminergic regulation of feeding behavior

* summarize quote: "noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (and also in the nucleus solitarius tract in the brainstem) are activated by exercise and send efferent signals to the ventromedial hypothalamus to enhance fat oxidation" [PMID 22547886]

====Cognitive====
In 2015, a [[systematic review]] and a [[meta-analysis]] of high quality [[clinical trial]]s found that, when used at low (therapeutic) doses, amphetamine produces modest yet unambiguous improvements in cognition, including [[working memory]], long-term [[episodic memory]], [[inhibitory control]], and some aspects of [[Attention#Clinical model|attention]], in normal healthy adults;<ref name="Unambiguous PFC D1 A2">{{cite journal | vauthors = Spencer RC, Devilbiss DM, Berridge CW | title = The Cognition-Enhancing Effects of Psychostimulants Involve Direct Action in the Prefrontal Cortex | journal = Biol.

Surprisingly, despite nearly 80 years of clinical use, the neurobiology of the procognitive actions of psychostimulants has only recently been systematically investigated. Findings from this research unambiguously demonstrate that the cognition-enhancing effects of psychostimulants involve the preferential elevation of catecholamines in the PFC and the subsequent activation of norepinephrine α2 and dopamine D1 receptors.&nbsp;... This differential modulation of PFC-dependent processes across dose appears to be associated with the differential involvement of noradrenergic α2 versus α1 receptors. Collectively, this evidence indicates that at low, clinically relevant doses, psychostimulants are devoid of the behavioral and neurochemical actions that define this class of drugs and instead act largely as cognitive enhancers (improving PFC-dependent function).&nbsp;... In particular, in both animals and humans, lower doses maximally improve performance in tests of working memory and response inhibition, whereas maximal suppression of overt behavior and facilitation of attentional processes occurs at higher doses. | pmc=4377121}}</ref><ref name="Cognitive and motivational effects">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ilieva IP, Hook CJ, Farah MJ | title = Prescription Stimulants' Effects on Healthy Inhibitory Control, Working Memory, and Episodic Memory: A Meta-analysis | journal = J.

However, the recent increase of methylphenidate use as a cognitive enhancer by the general public has again raised concerns because of its potential for abuse and addiction (3, 6–10).

Genetic or pharmacological blockade of G9a in the NAc potentiates behavioral responses to cocaine and opiates, whereas increasing G9a function exerts the opposite effect (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a). Such drug-induced downregulation of G9a and H3K9me2 also sensitizes animals to the deleterious effects of subsequent chronic stress (Covington et al., 2011). Downregulation of G9a increases the dendritic arborization of NAc neurons, and is associated with increased expression of numerous proteins implicated in synaptic function, which directly connects altered G9a/H3K9me2 in the synaptic plasticity associated with addiction (Maze et al., 2010).<br />G9a appears to be a critical control point for epigenetic regulation in NAc, as we know it functions in two negative feedback loops. It opposes the induction of ΔFosB, a long-lasting transcription factor important for drug addiction (Robison and Nestler, 2011), while ΔFosB in turn suppresses G9a expression (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a).&nbsp;... Also, G9a is induced in NAc upon prolonged HDAC inhibition, which explains the paradoxical attenuation of cocaine’s behavioral effects seen under these conditions, as noted above (Kennedy et al., 2013). GABAA receptor subunit genes are among those that are controlled by this feedback loop. Thus, chronic cocaine, or prolonged HDAC inhibition, induces several GABAA receptor subunits in NAc, which is associated with increased frequency of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). In striking contrast, combined exposure to cocaine and HDAC inhibition, which triggers the induction of G9a and increased global levels of H3K9me2, leads to blockade of GABAA receptor and IPSC regulation. -->}}</ref> Sufficiently overexpressing ΔJunD in the nucleus accumbens with [[viral vector]]s can completely block many of the neural and behavioral alterations seen in chronic drug abuse (i.e., the alterations mediated by ΔFosB).<ref name="Nestler" /> ΔFosB also plays an important role in regulating behavioral responses to [[natural reward]]s, such as palatable food, sex, and exercise.<ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /><ref name="Nestler" /><ref name="ΔFosB reward">{{cite journal |vauthors=Blum K, Werner T, Carnes S, Carnes P, Bowirrat A, Giordano J, Oscar-Berman M, Gold M | title = Sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll: hypothesizing common mesolimbic activation as a function of reward gene polymorphisms | journal = J.

===Synthesis===
{{Details|topic=illicit amphetamine synthesis|History and culture of substituted amphetamines#Illegal synthesis}}

Since the first preparation was reported in 1887,<ref name="Vermont"/> numerous synthetic routes to amphetamine have been developed.<ref name="Allen_Ely_2009">{{cite journal | url = http://www.nwafs.org/newsletters/2011_Spring.pdf | title = Review: Synthetic Methods for Amphetamine |vauthors=Allen A, Ely R | format = PDF | publisher = Northwest Association of Forensic Scientists | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | date = April 2009 | pages = 15–25 | journal = Crime Scene | accessdate = 6 December 2014}}</ref><ref name="Allen_Cantrell_1989">{{cite journal |vauthors=Allen A, Cantrell TS | title = Synthetic reductions in clandestine amphetamine and methamphetamine laboratories: A review | journal = Forensic Science International | date = August 1989 | volume = 42 | issue = 3 | pages = 183–199 | doi = 10.1016/0379-0738(89)90086-8 }}</ref>  The most common route of both legal and illicit amphetamine synthesis employs a non-metal reduction known as the [[Leuckart reaction]] (method&nbsp;1).<ref name="EMC"/><ref name="Amph Synth" />  In the first step, a reaction between phenylacetone and [[formamide]], either using additional [[formic acid]] or formamide itself as a reducing agent, yields {{nowrap|[[N-formylamphetamine|''N''-formylamphetamine]]}}.  This intermediate is then hydrolyzed using hydrochloric acid, and subsequently basified, extracted with organic solvent, concentrated, and distilled to yield the free base. The free base is then dissolved in an organic solvent, sulfuric acid added, and amphetamine precipitates out as the sulfate salt.<ref name="Amph Synth" /><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jo01145a001 | title = The Mechanism of the Leuckart Reaction |date=May 1951 |vauthors=Pollard CB, Young DC | journal = J.

A number of [[chiral resolution]]s have been developed to separate the two enantiomers of amphetamine.<ref name = "Allen_Ely_2009"/> For example, racemic amphetamine can be treated with {{nowrap|d-[[tartaric acid]]}} to form a [[diastereoisomer]]ic salt which is [[fractional crystallization (chemistry)|fractionally]] crystallized to yield dextroamphetamine.<ref name = "US2276508">{{ cite patent  | country = US  | number = 2276508  | status = patent  | title = Method for the separation of optically active alpha-methylphenethylamine  | pubdate = 17 March 1942  | fdate = 3 November 1939  | pridate = 3 November 1939  | inventor = Nabenhauer FP  | assign1 = Smith Kline French }}</ref> Chiral resolution remains the most economical method for obtaining optically pure amphetamine on a large scale.<ref name = "Gray_2007"/> In addition, several [[enantioselective synthesis|enantioselective]] syntheses of amphetamine have been developed. In one example, [[optically pure]] {{nowrap|(''R'')-1-phenyl-ethanamine}} is condensed with phenylacetone to yield a chiral [[Schiff base]].  In the key step, this intermediate is reduced by [[catalytic hydrogenation]] with a transfer of chirality to the carbon atom alpha to the amino group.  Cleavage of the [[benzylic]] amine bond by hydrogenation yields optically pure dextroamphetamine.<ref name = "Gray_2007">{{Cite book  |veditors=Johnson DS, Li JJ | author = Gray DL | title = The Art of Drug Synthesis | chapter = Approved Treatments for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: Amphetamine (Adderall), Methylphenidate (Ritalin), and Atomoxetine (Straterra) | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=zvruBDAulWEC&lpg=PP1&dq=The%20Art%20of%20Drug%20Synthesis%20(Wiley%20Series%20on%20Drug%20Synthesis)&pg=SA17-PA4#v=onepage&q=amphetamine&f=false | year = 2007 | publisher = Wiley-Interscience | location = New York, USA | isbn = 9780471752158 | page = 247 }}</ref>

A large number of alternative synthetic routes to amphetamine have been developed based on classic organic reactions.<ref name="Allen_Ely_2009"/><ref name="Allen_Cantrell_1989"/> One example is the [[Friedel–Crafts reaction#Friedel–Crafts alkylation|Friedel–Crafts]] alkylation of [[benzene]] by [[allyl chloride]] to yield beta chloropropylbenzene which is then reacted with ammonia to produce racemic amphetamine (method&nbsp;2).<ref name="pmid20985610">{{cite journal |vauthors=Patrick TM, McBee ET, Hass HB | title = Synthesis of arylpropylamines; from allyl chloride | journal = J.
