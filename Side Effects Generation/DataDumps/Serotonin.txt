These include the regulation of [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], [[appetite]], and [[sleep]].  Serotonin also has some cognitive functions, including memory and learning. Modulation of serotonin at synapses is thought to be a major action of several classes of pharmacological antidepressants.

Serotonin secreted from the [[enterochromaffin cells]] eventually finds its way out of tissues into the blood. There, it is actively taken up by blood [[platelet]]s, which store it. When the platelets bind to a clot, they release serotonin, where it serves as a [[vasoconstriction|vasoconstrictor]] and helps to regulate [[hemostasis]] and blood clotting. Serotonin is also a growth factor for some types of cells, which may give it a role in wound healing. There are various [[5-HT receptor|serotonin receptors]].

Serotonin is metabolized mainly to [[5-HIAA]], chiefly by the liver.  Metabolism involves first [[oxidation]] by [[monoamine oxidase]] to the corresponding [[aldehyde]].  This is followed by oxidation by [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]] to 5-HIAA,  the indole acetic acid derivative.   The latter is then excreted by the kidneys.

In addition to [[animals]], serotonin is found in [[fungi]] and [[plant]]s.<ref name="pmid19308403">{{cite journal|author = Kang K, Park S, Kim YS, Lee S, Back K|title = Biosynthesis and biotechnological production of serotonin derivatives|journal = Appl.

==Functions==
Serotonin is a neurotransmitter and is found in all [[bilateria|bilateral animals]], where it mediates gut movements and the animal's perceptions of resource availability.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} In less complex animals, such as some [[invertebrates]], resources simply mean food availability. In more complex animals, such as [[arthropod]]s and [[vertebrate]]s, resources also can mean social dominance. In response to the perceived abundance or scarcity of resources, an animal's growth, reproduction or [[mood (psychology)|mood]] may be elevated or lowered. This may somewhat depend on how much serotonin the organism has at its disposal.<ref>[http://www.livestrong.com/article/154361-effects-of-serotonin-on-the-body/ Coila, Bridgett.

===Cellular effects===

====Receptors====
{{Main article|5-HT receptor}}
The [[5-HT receptor]]s, the [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] for serotonin, are located on the cell membrane of [[Neuron|nerve cells]] and other cell types in animals, and mediate the effects of serotonin as the [[endogenous]] [[ligand]] and of a broad range of pharmaceutical and [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic drugs]]. Except for the [[5-HT3|5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor]], a ligand-gated [[ion channel]], all other 5-HT receptors are [[G-protein-coupled receptors]] (also called seven-transmembrane, or heptahelical receptors) that activate an [[intracellular]] [[second messenger]] cascade.<ref name="pmid18571247">{{cite journal|author = Hannon J, Hoyer D|title = Molecular biology of 5-HT receptors|journal = Behav. Brain Res.|volume = 195|issue = 1|pages = 198–213|year = 2008|pmid = 18571247|doi = 10.1016/j.bbr.2008.03.020|last2 = Hoyer}}</ref>

====Termination====
Serotonergic action is terminated primarily via [[reuptake|uptake]] of 5-HT from the synapse. This is accomplished through the specific [[monoamine transporter]] for 5-HT, [[Serotonin transporter|SERT]], on the presynaptic neuron. Various agents can inhibit 5-HT reuptake, including [[cocaine]], [[dextromethorphan]] (an [[antitussive]]), [[tricyclic antidepressants]] and [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs). A 2006 study conducted by the [[University of Washington]] suggested that a newly discovered monoamine transporter, known as [[Plasma membrane monoamine transporter|PMAT]], may account for "a significant percentage of 5-HT clearance".<ref name="pmid 1828907">{{cite journal|author = Zhou M, Engel K, Wang J|title = Evidence for significant contribution of a newly identified monoamine transporter (PMAT) to serotonin uptake in the human brain|journal = Biochem. Pharmacol.|volume = 73|issue = 1|pages = 147–54|year = 2007|pmc = 1828907|doi = 10.1016/j.bcp.2006.09.008|pmid = 17046718|last2 = Engel|last3 = Wang}}</ref>

Contrasting with the high-affinity SERT, the PMAT has been identified as a low-affinity transporter, with an apparent K<sub>m</sub> of 114 micromoles/l for serotonin; approximately 230 times higher than that of SERT. However, the PMAT, despite its relatively low serotonergic affinity, has a considerably higher transport 'capacity' than SERT, "resulting in roughly comparable uptake efficiencies to SERT in heterologous expression systems." The study also suggests some SSRIs, such as [[fluoxetine]] and [[sertraline]] anti-depressants, inhibit PMAT but at [[IC50|IC<sub>50</sub>]] values which surpass the therapeutic plasma concentrations by up to four orders of magnitude. Therefore, SSRI monotherapy is "ineffective" in PMAT inhibition. At present, no known pharmaceuticals are known to appreciably inhibit PMAT at normal therapeutic doses. The PMAT also suggestively transports dopamine and norepinephrine, albeit at K<sub>m</sub> values even higher than that of 5-HT (330–15,000 μmoles/L).

====Serotonylation====
{{Main article|Serotonylation}}
Serotonin can also signal through a nonreceptor mechanism called serotonylation, in which serotonin modifies proteins.<ref name="pmid19859528"/> This process underlies serotonin's effects upon platelet-forming cells ([[thrombocyte]]s) in which it links to the modification of signaling enzymes called [[GTPase]]s that then trigger the release of vesicle contents by [[exocytosis]].<ref name="pmid14697203">{{cite journal|author = Walther DJ, Peter JU, Winter S, Höltje M, Paulmann N, Grohmann M, Vowinckel J, Alamo-Bethencourt V, Wilhelm CS, Ahnert-Hilger G, Bader M|title = Serotonylation of small GTPases is a signal transduction pathway that triggers platelet alpha-granule release|journal = Cell|volume = 115|issue = 7|pages = 851–62|year = 2003|pmid = 14697203|doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(03)01014-6|last2 = Peter|last3 = Winter|last4 = Höltje|last5 = Paulmann|last6 = Grohmann|last7 = Vowinckel|last8 = Alamo-Bethencourt|last9 = Wilhelm|last10 = Ahnert-Hilger|last11 = Bader}}</ref> A similar process underlies the pancreatic release of insulin.<ref name="pmid19859528"/>

===Nervous system===

[[File:Pubmed equitativa hormonal.png|thumb|right|alt= In this drawing of the brain, the serotonergic system is red and the mesolimbic dopamine pathway is blue. There is one collection of serotonergic neurons in the upper brainstem that sends [[axon]]s upwards to the whole cerebrum, and one collection next to the cerebellum that sends axons downward to the spinal cord. Slightly forward the upper serotonergic neurons is the [[ventral tegmental area]] (VTA), which contains dopaminergic neurons. These neurons' axons then connect to the [[nucleus accumbens]], [[hippocampus]] and the [[frontal cortex]]. Over the VTA is another collection of dopaminergic cells, the [[substansia nigra]], which send axons to the [[striatum]]. |Serotonin system, contrasted with the [[Mesolimbic pathway|dopamine system]]]]

The neurons of the [[raphe nuclei]] are the principal source of 5-HT release in the brain.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Frazer, A. |author2=Hensler, J. G. |last-author-amp=yes | editor = Siegel, G.

Siegel}}</ref>
There are nine raphe nuclei, designated B1-B9, which contain the majority of serotonin-containing neurons (some scientists chose to group the ''nuclei raphes lineares'' into one nucleus), all of which are located along the midline of the [[brainstem]], and centered on the [[reticular formation]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Binder|first1=Marc D.|last2=Hirokawa|first2=Nobutaka|title=encyclopedia of neuroscience|date=2009|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-540-23735-8|page=705}}</ref><ref>The raphe nuclei group of [[neurons]] are located along the [[reticular formation|brain stem]] from the labels '[[mesencephalon|Mid Brain]]' to '[[medulla oblongata|Oblongata]]', centered on the [[pons]]. ([[:Image:Gray715.png|See relevant image]].)</ref>
Axons from the neurons of the raphe nuclei form a [[neurotransmitter system]] reaching almost every part of the central nervous system. Axons of neurons in the lower raphe nuclei terminate in the [[cerebellum]] and [[spinal cord]], while the axons of the higher nuclei spread out in the entire brain.

====Ultrastructure and Function====
The serotonin nuclei may also be divided into two main groups, the rostral and caudal containing three and four nuclei respectively.  The rostral group consists of the caudal linear nuclei (B8), the dorsal raphe nuclei (B6 and B7) and the median raphe nuclei (B5, B8 and B9), that project into multiple cortical and subcortical structures.  The caudal group consists of the nucleus raphe magnus (B3), raphe obscurus nucleus (B2), raphe pallidus nucleus (B1), and lateral medullary reticular formation, that project into the brainstem.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jacobs|first1=edited by Christian P. Müller, Barry|title=Handbook of the behavioral neurobiology of serotonin|date=2009|publisher=Academic|location=London|isbn=9780123746344|pages=51–59|edition=1st}}</ref>

Serotonergic pathway are involved in sensorimotor function, with pathways projecting both into cortical (Dorsal and Median Raphe Nuclei), subcortical, and spinal areas involved in motor activity.  Pharmacological manipulation suggest that serotonergic activity increases with motor activity, while firing rates of serotonergic neurons increase with intense visual stimuli.  The descending projections form a pathway that inhibits pain called the "descending inhibitory pathway" that may be relevant to disorder such as fibromyalgia, migraine and other pain disorders, and the efficacy of antidepressants in them.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jacobs|first1=edited by Christian P.

====Microanatomy====
Serotonin is released into the synapse, or space between neurons, and diffuses over a relatively wide gap (>20&nbsp;µm) to activate [[5-HT receptor]]s located on the [[dendrite]]s, cell bodies and [[presynaptic terminal]]s of adjacent neurons.

When humans smell food, dopamine is released to [[incentive salience|increase the appetite]]. But, unlike in worms, serotonin does not increase anticipatory behaviour in humans; instead, the serotonin released while consuming activates [[5-HT2C receptor]]s on dopamine-producing cells. This halts their dopamine release, and thereby serotonin decreases appetite. Drugs that block 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors make the body unable to recognize when it is no longer hungry or otherwise in need of nutrients, and are associated with weight gain,<ref name="pmid19178394">{{cite journal |author=Stahl SM, Mignon L, Meyer JM |title=Which comes first: atypical antipsychotic treatment or cardiometabolic risk? |journal=Acta Psychiatr Scand |volume=119 |issue=3 |pages=171–9 |year=2009|pmid=19178394 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.2008.01334.x|last2=Mignon |last3=Meyer }}</ref> especially in people with a low number of receptors.<ref name="pmid15741483">{{cite journal |author=Buckland PR, Hoogendoorn B, Guy CA, Smith SK, Coleman SL, O'Donovan MC |title=Low gene expression conferred by association of an allele of the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor gene with antipsychotic-induced weight gain |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=162 |issue=3 |pages=613–5 |year=2005 |pmid=15741483 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.162.3.613|last2=Hoogendoorn |last3=Guy |last4=Smith |last5=Coleman |last6=O'Donovan }}</ref> The expression of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors in the [[hippocampus]] follows a [[circadian rhythm|diurnal rhythm]],<ref name="pmid9151722">{{cite journal |author=Holmes MC, French KL, Seckl JR |title=Dysregulation of diurnal rhythms of serotonin 5-HT2C and corticosteroid receptor gene expression in the hippocampus with food restriction and glucocorticoids |journal=J.

The amount of food that an animal acquires  depends not only on food availability but also on the animal's ability to compete with others. This is especially true for [[Sociality|social]] animals, where the stronger individuals might steal food from the weaker (this is not to say some non-social animals do not concern themselves with the needs of others or steal food from others{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}). Thus, serotonin is involved not only in the perception of food availability but also in social rank.

In [[macaque]]s, alpha males have twice the level of serotonin released in the brain than subordinate males and females (as measured by the levels of 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the cerebro-spinal fluid). Dominance status and cerebro-serotonin levels appear to be positively correlated. When dominant males were removed from such groups, subordinate males begin competing for dominance. Once new dominance hierarchies were established, serotonin levels of the new dominant individuals also increased to double those in subordinate males and females. The reason why serotonin levels are only high in dominant males but not dominant females has not yet been established.<ref>McGuire, Michael (2013) "Believing, the neuroscience of fantasies, fears and confictions" (Prometius Books)</ref>

===Outside the nervous system===

====In the digestive tract (emetic)====
The gut is surrounded by [[enterochromaffin cell]]s, which release serotonin in response to food in the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]]. This makes the gut contract around the food. Platelets in the [[Hepatic portal system|veins draining the gut]] collect excess serotonin.

If irritants are present in the food, the enterochromaffin cells release more serotonin to make the gut move faster, i.e., to cause diarrhea, so the gut is emptied of the noxious substance. If serotonin is released in the blood faster than the platelets can absorb it, the level of free serotonin in the blood is increased. This activates [[5-HT3 receptor]]s in the [[chemoreceptor trigger zone]] that stimulate [[vomiting]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Rang, H.

===Antidepressants===
{{main article|SSRI|MAOI}}
Drugs that alter serotonin levels are used in treating [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[generalized anxiety disorder]] and [[social anxiety disorder|social phobia]]. [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAOIs) prevent the breakdown of [[monoamine neurotransmitter]]s (including serotonin), and therefore increase concentrations of the neurotransmitter in the brain. MAOI therapy is associated with many adverse drug reactions, and patients are at risk of [[hypertensive emergency]] triggered by foods with high [[tyramine]] content, and certain drugs. Some drugs inhibit the re-uptake of serotonin, making it stay in the synaptic cleft longer. The [[tricyclic antidepressants]] (TCAs) inhibit the reuptake of both serotonin and [[norepinephrine]]. The newer [[selective and non-selective|selective]] serotonin reuptake inhibitors ([[SSRI]]s) have fewer side-effects and fewer interactions with other drugs.<ref>{{Cite book  | last1 = Goodman | first1 = Louis S.

====Serotonin syndrome====
{{Main article|Serotonin syndrome}}
Extremely high levels of serotonin can cause a condition known as [[serotonin syndrome]], with toxic and potentially fatal effects. In practice, such toxic levels are essentially impossible to reach through an [[overdose]] of a single antidepressant drug, but require a combination of serotonergic agents, such as an [[SSRI]] with an [[MAOI]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Isbister, G.

===Antiemetics===
Some [[5-HT3 antagonist|5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonists]], such as [[ondansetron]], [[granisetron]], and [[tropisetron]], are important [[antiemetic]] agents. They are particularly important in treating the [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]] that occur during anticancer [[chemotherapy]] using cytotoxic drugs. Another application is in the treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting.

===Other===

Some serotonergic agonist drugs cause fibrosis anywhere in the body, particularly the syndrome of [[retroperitoneal fibrosis]], as well as [[cardiac fibrosis|cardiac valve fibrosis]].<ref name="Baskin">{{cite book|author = Baskin SI|title = Principles of cardiac toxicology|publisher = CRC Press|location = Boca Raton|year = 1991|isbn = 0-8493-8809-0|url = https://books.google.com/?id=AW7M6jBixj4C&pg=PA626|accessdate = 3 February 2010}}</ref>
In the past, three groups of serotonergic drugs have been epidemiologically linked with these syndromes. These are the serotonergic vasoconstrictive antimigraine drugs ([[ergotamine]] and [[methysergide]]),<ref name=Baskin/> the serotonergic appetite suppressant drugs ([[fenfluramine]], [[chlorphentermine]], and [[aminorex]]), and certain anti-Parkinsonian dopaminergic agonists, which also stimulate serotonergic 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors. These include [[pergolide]] and [[cabergoline]], but not the more dopamine-specific [[lisuride]].<ref name="urluserpage.fu-berlin.de">{{cite web|url = http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~hpertz/Presentation001.pdf|title = Pergolide and Cabergoline But not Lisuride Exhibit Agonist Efficacy at Serotonin 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> Receptors|author1=Jähnichen S |author2=Horowski R |author3=Pertz H |accessdate = 3 February 2010}}</ref>

As with fenfluramine, some of these drugs have been withdrawn from the market after groups taking them showed a statistical increase of one or more of the side effects described. An example is [[pergolide]]. The drug was declining in use since it was reported in 2003 to be associated with cardiac fibrosis.<ref name="ADRAC_2004">{{cite journal|url=http://www.tga.gov.au/adr/aadrb/aadr0408.htm |year=2004 |title=Cardiac valvulopathy with pergolide |journal=Aust Adv Drug React Bull |volume=23 |issue=4 |author1=Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee, Australia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627200919/http://www.tga.gov.au/adr/aadrb/aadr0408.htm |archivedate=27 June 2012 }}</ref>

===Methyl-tryptamines and hallucinogens===
{{for|details on tryptamine neurotransmitters in humans|Trace amine}}
Several plants contain serotonin together with a family of related [[tryptamine]]s that are [[methylation|methylated]] at the [[amine|amino]] (NH<sub>2</sub>) and [[hydroxyl|(OH) groups]], are [[amine oxide|''N''-oxides]], or miss the OH group. These compounds do reach the brain, although some portion of them are metabolized by [[monoamine oxidase]] enzymes (mainly [[MAO-A]]) in the liver. Examples are plants from the ''[[Anadenanthera]]'' genus that are used in the [[hallucinogen]]ic [[yopo]] snuff. These compounds are widely present in the leaves of many plants, and may serve as deterrents for animal ingestion. Serotonin occurs in several mushrooms of the genus ''[[Panaeolus]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tyler VE |title=Occurrence of serotonin in a hallucinogenic mushroom |journal=Science |volume=128 |issue=3326 |pages=718 |date=September 1958  |pmid=13580242 |doi=10.1126/science.128.3326.718 |bibcode=1958Sci...128..718T}}</ref>

==Diseases and disorders==

Serotonin in mammals is made by two different [[tryptophan hydroxylase]]s: [[TPH1]] produces serotonin in the [[pineal gland]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Prasad|first=Parvathy|last2=Ogawa|first2=Satoshi|last3=Parhar|first3=Ishwar S.|date=2015-06-05|title=Role of serotonin in fish reproduction|journal=Frontiers in Neuroscience|volume=9|doi=10.3389/fnins.2015.00195|issn=1662-4548|pmc=4456567|pmid=26097446}}</ref> and the enterochromaffin cells, while [[TPH2]] produces it in the [[Raphe nuclei]] and in the [[myenteric plexus]].
Genetically altered mice lacking TPH1 develop progressive loss of heart strength early on. They have pale skin and breathing difficulties, are easily tired, and eventually die of [[heart failure]].<ref name="pmid14597720">{{cite journal |author=Côté F |title=Disruption of the nonneuronal tph1 gene demonstrates the importance of peripheral serotonin in cardiac function |journal=Proc.

Genetically altered mice that lack TPH2 are normal when they are born. However, after three days, they appear to be smaller and weaker, and have softer skin than their siblings. In a [[purebred]] strain, 50% of the mutants died during the first four weeks, but in a mixed strain, 90% survived. Normally, the mother [[weaning|weans]] the litter after three weeks, but the mutant animals needed five weeks. After that, they caught up in growth and had normal mortality rates. Subtle changes in the [[autonomic nervous system]] are present, but the most obvious difference from normal mice is the increased aggressiveness and impairment in maternal care of young.<ref name="Alenina">{{cite journal|author = Alenina N, Kikic D, Todiras M, Mosienko V, Qadri F, Plehm R, Boyé P, Vilianovitch L, Sohr R, Tenner K, Hörtnagl H, Bader M|title = Growth retardation and altered autonomic control in mice lacking brain serotonin|journal = Proc.

Despite the blood-brain barrier, the loss of serotonin production in the brain is partially compensated by intestinal serotonin.

Low serotonin signals to the entoamoebas they are outside a host and they become less virulent to conserve energy. When they enter a new host, they multiply in the gut, and become more virulent as the enterochromaffine cells get provoked by them and the serotonin concentration increases.

===Plants===
In drying [[seed]]s, serotonin production is a way to get rid of the buildup of poisonous [[ammonia]]. The ammonia is collected and placed in the [[indole]] part of <small>L</small>-[[tryptophan]], which is then [[decarboxylation|decarboxylated]] by [[Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase|tryptophan decarboxylase]] to give tryptamine, which is then [[hydroxylation|hydroxylated]] by a [[cytochrome P450 monooxygenase]], yielding serotonin.<ref name="Schröder et al.">{{cite journal|author=Schröder P, Abele C, Gohr P, Stuhlfauth-Roisch U, Grosse W.|year= 1999|title=Latest on enzymology of serotonin biosynthesis in walnut seeds|journal=Adv Exp Med Biol.|volume=467|pages=637–644|pmid=10721112|doi=10.1007/978-1-4615-4709-9_81|series=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology|isbn=978-0-306-46204-7|last2= Abele|last3= Gohr|last4= Stuhlfauth-Roisch|last5= Grosse}}</ref>

However, since serotonin is a major gastrointestinal tract modulator, it may be produced by plants in fruits as a way of speeding the passage of seeds through the digestive tract, in the same way as many well-known seed and fruit associated laxatives.

Serotonin functions as a neurotransmitter in the nervous systems of most animals.

===Aging and age-related phenotypes===
Serotonin is known to regulate aging, learning and memory.

==Biochemical mechanisms==

===Biosynthesis===
[[File:Serotonin biosynthesis.svg|thumb|right|340px|alt= On top an L-tryptophan molecule with an arrow down to a 5-HTP molecule.  [[Tryptophan hydroxylase]] catalyses this reaction with help of O<sub>2</sub> and [[tetrahydrobiopterin]], which becomes water and [[dihydrobiopterin]]. From the 5-HTP molecule goes an arrow down to a serotonin molecule. Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase or 5-Hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase catalyses this reaction with help of [[pyridoxal phosphate]]. From the serotonin molecule goes an arrow to a 5-HIAA molecule at the bottom ot the image. Monoamine oxidase catalyses this reaction, in the process O<sub>2</sub> and water is consumed, and ammonia and hydrogen peroxide is produced.|The pathway for the synthesis of serotonin from tryptophan.]]
In animals including humans, serotonin is [[Biosynthesis|synthesized]] from the [[amino acid]] <small>L</small>-[[tryptophan]] by a short [[metabolic pathway]] consisting of three [[enzyme]]s: [[tryptophan hydroxylase]] (TPH), [[Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase|aromatic amino acid decarboxylase]] (DDC) and [[pyridoxal phosphate]]. The TPH-mediated reaction is the rate-limiting step in the pathway.
TPH has been shown to exist in two forms: [[TPH1]], found in several [[Biological tissue|tissues]], and [[TPH2]], which is a neuron-specific [[Protein isoform|isoform]].<ref name="pmid14597720" />

Serotonin can be synthesized from tryptophan in the lab using [[Aspergillus niger]] and [[Psilocybe coprophila]] as catalysts. The first phase to 5-hydroxytryptophan would require letting tryptophan sit in ethanol and water for 7 days, then mixing in enough HCl (or other acid) to bring the pH to 3, and then adding NaOH to make a pH of 13 for 1 hour. ''Asperigillus niger'' would be the catalyst for this first phase. The second phase to synthesizing tryptophan itself from the 5-hydroxytryptophan intermediate would require adding ethanol and water, and letting sit for 30 days this time. The next two steps would be the same as the first phase: adding HCl to make the pH = 3, and then adding NaOH to make the pH very basic at 13 for 1 hour. This phase uses the ''Psilocybe coprophila'' as the catalyst for the reaction.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Alarcon | first1 = J | year = 2008 | title = Biotransformation of indole derivatives by mycelial cultures | url = | journal = Zeitschrift für Naturforschung C | volume = 63 | issue = | page = 82 | doi=10.1515/znc-2008-1-215}}</ref>

Serotonin taken orally does not pass into the serotonergic pathways of the central nervous system, because it does not cross the [[blood–brain barrier]].<ref name="pmid18043762" /> However, [[tryptophan]] and its [[metabolite]] [[5-hydroxytryptophan]] (5-HTP), from which serotonin is synthesized, does cross the blood–brain barrier. These agents are available as [[dietary supplement]]s, and may be effective serotonergic agents.
One product of serotonin breakdown is [[5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid]] (5-HIAA), which is excreted in the [[urine]]. Serotonin and 5-HIAA are sometimes produced in excess amounts by certain [[tumor]]s or [[cancer]]s, and levels of these substances may be measured in the urine to test for these tumors.

===Effects of food content===
{{See also|Tryptophan}}
Consuming purified tryptophan increases brain serotonin whereas eating foods containing tryptophan does not.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wurtman | first1 = RJ | last2 = Hefti | first2 = F | last3 = Melamed | first3 = E | year = 1980 | title = Precursor control of neurotransmitter synthesis | pmid = 6115400| journal = Pharmacol Rev | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 315–35 }}</ref> This is because the transport system which brings tryptophan across the [[blood-brain barrier]] is also selective for the other amino acids contained in protein sources.<ref name="pmid18043762">{{cite journal|author = Young SN|title = How to increase serotonin in the human brain without drugs|journal = J Psychiatry Neurosci|volume = 32|issue = 6|pages = 394–9|year = 2007|pmid = 18043762|pmc = 2077351}}</ref> High plasma levels of other large neutral amino acids compete for transport and prevent the elevated plasma tryptophan from increasing serotonin synthesis.

==History and etymology==
In 1935, Italian [[Vittorio Erspamer]] showed an extract from [[enterochromaffin cell]]s made intestines contract. Some believed it contained [[adrenaline]], but two years later, Erspamer was able to show it was a previously unknown [[amine]], which he named "enteramine".<ref name="pmid17526278">{{cite journal |author=Negri L |title=[Vittorio Erspamer (1909–1999)] |language=Italian |journal=Med Secoli |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=97–113 |year=2006 |pmid=17526278 }}</ref> In 1948, [[Maurice M. Rapport]], Arda Green, and [[Irvine Page]] of the [[Cleveland Clinic]] discovered a vasoconstrictor substance in [[blood plasma|blood serum]], and since it was a serum agent affecting vascular tone, they named it serotonin.<ref name="pmid18100415">{{cite journal |author=Rapport MM, Green AA, Page IH |title=Serum vasoconstrictor, serotonin; isolation and characterization |journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=176 |issue=3 |pages=1243–51 |date=December 1948  |pmid=18100415|last2=Green |last3=Page }}</ref>

In 1952, enteramine was shown to be the same substance as serotonin, and as the broad range of physiological roles was elucidated, the abbreviation 5-HT of the proper chemical name 5-hydroxytryptamine became the preferred name in the pharmacological field.<ref name="pmid13035756">{{cite journal |author=FELDBERG W, TOH CC |title=Distribution of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin, enteramine) in the wall of the digestive tract |journal=The Journal of Physiology |volume=119 |issue=2–3 |pages=352–62 |date=February 1953  |pmid=13035756 |pmc=1392800 |url=http://www.jphysiol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=13035756|last2=Toh |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1953.sp004850}}</ref> Synonyms of serotonin include: 5-hydroxytriptamine, thrombotin, enteramin, substance DS, and 3-(β-Aminoethyl)-5-hydroxyindole.<ref>SciFinder – Serotonin Substance Detail.
