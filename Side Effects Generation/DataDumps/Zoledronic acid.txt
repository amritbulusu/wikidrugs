'''Zoledronic acid''', also known as '''zoledronate''', is a [[bisphosphonate]] drug given [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]] to treat some [[bone disease]]s. It is sold under many trade names worldwide.<ref name=drugs.comINT>Drugs.com [http://www.drugs.com/international/zoledronic-acid.html International trade names for zoledronic acid] Page accessed Jan 14, 2015</ref>

<!-- History and culture -->
It is on the [[World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines]], the most effective and safe medicines needed in a [[health system]].<ref name=WHO20th>{{cite web|title=WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (20th List)|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/20th_EML2017.pdf?ua=1|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=29 June 2017|date=March 2017}}</ref>

==Medical uses==

===Bone complications of cancer===
Zometa is used to prevent [[skeletal]] [[fracture]]s in patients with [[cancer]]s such as [[multiple myeloma]] and [[prostate cancer]], as well as for treating [[osteoporosis]].<ref>National Prescribing Service (2009). "Zoledronic Acid for Osteoporosis". ''Medicines Update'', Available at {{cite web|url=http://www.nps.org.au/consumers/publications/medicine_update/issues/Zoledronic_acid |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 20, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423105839/http://www.nps.org.au/consumers/publications/medicine_update/issues/zoledronic_acid |archivedate=April 23, 2010 }}</ref> It can also be used to treat [[hypercalcemia]] of malignancy and can be helpful for treating pain from bone metastases.<ref name=zomera>http://www.health.gov.il/units/pharmacy/trufot/alonim/533.pdf Zomera prescribing information</ref>

It can be administered at home rather than in hospital. Such administration has shown safety and quality-of-life benefits in [[breast cancer]] patients with bone metastases.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 15870721 | doi=10.1038/sj.bjc.6602551 | volume=92 | issue=10 | title=Zoledronic acid significantly improves pain scores and quality of life in breast cancer patients with bone metastases: a randomised, crossover study of community vs hospital bisphosphonate administration | pmc=2361764 | date=May 2005 | journal=Br. J. Cancer | pages=1869–76 | last1 = Wardley | first1 = A | last2 = Davidson | first2 = N | last3 = Barrett-Lee | first3 = P | display-authors = etal  }}</ref>

===Osteoporosis===
Marketed as Aclasta (in Australia) or Reclast (in the US), zoledronic acid may be given as a 5&nbsp;mg infusion once per year for treatment of [[osteoporosis]] in men and post-menopausal women at increased risk of fracture.{{mcn|date=January 2014}}

In 2007, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) also approved Reclast for the treatment of postmenopausal [[osteoporosis]].{{mcn|date=January 2014}}

===Paget's disease===
As Reclast a single dose of 5&nbsp;mg is used for the treatment of [[Paget's disease of bone|Paget's disease]].{{mcn|date=January 2014}}<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.rheumatology.org/Practice/Clinical/Patients/Diseases_And_Conditions/Paget_s_Disease_of_Bone/|website = www.rheumatology.org|accessdate = 2015-07-09|title=Paget's Disease of Bone}}</ref>

==Contraindications==
*Poor renal function (e.g. [[renal function|CrCl]]<30 mL/min)<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Vondracek | first1 = S. F. | title = Managing osteoporosis in postmenopausal women | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | volume = 67 | issue = 7 Suppl 3 | pages = S9–19 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20332498 | doi = 10.2146/ajhp100076 }}</ref>
*[[Hypocalcaemia]]
*Pregnancy
*Paralysis

==Side effects==
Side effects can include [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], [[anemia]], [[muscle pain|muscle aches]], [[fever]], and/or [[Edema|swelling]] in the feet or legs. [[Flu-like symptoms]] are commonly experienced after the first zoledronate infusion, although not subsequent infusions, and are thought to occur because of its potential to activate human [[γδ T cells]] (gamma/delta T cells).

There is a risk of severe renal impairment. Appropriate [[Rehydration|hydration]] is important prior to administration, as is adequate [[calcium]] and [[vitamin D]] intake prior to Aclasta therapy in patients with preexisting [[hypocalcaemia]], and for ten days following Aclasta in patients with Paget's disease of the bone. Monitoring for other mineral metabolism disorders and the avoidance of invasive dental procedures for those who develop [[osteonecrosis of the jaw]] is recommended.<ref>http://www.nps.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/60945/nvcaclin.pdf</ref>

Zoledronate is rapidly processed via the [[kidney]]s; consequently its administration is not recommended for patients with reduced [[renal function]] or kidney disease.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emc.medicines.org.uk/medicine/14062/SPC/Zometa+4mg+5ml+Concentrate+for+Solution+for+Infusion/|title=Zometa 4mg/5ml Concentrate for Solution for Infusion|work=medicines.org.uk}}</ref> Some cases of acute renal failure either requiring dialysis or having a fatal outcome following Reclast use have been reported to the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/fda/reclast-zoledronic-acid-safety-communication-new-updated-warning-kidney-impairment-13020.html|title=FDA Alert: Reclast (zoledronic acid): Drug Safety Communication - New Contraindication and Updated Warning on Kidney Impairment|work=drugs.com}}</ref> This assessment was confirmed by the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA), whose Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) specified new contraindications for the medication on 15 December 2011, which include hypocalcaemia and severe renal impairment with a [[creatinine]] clearance of less than 35 ml/min.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/000595/smops/Positive/human_smop_000319.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d127|title=European Medicines Agency - Human medicines|work=europa.eu}}</ref>

A rare complication that has been recently observed in cancer patients being treated with bisphosphonates is [[osteonecrosis of the jaw]].  This has mainly been seen in patients with [[multiple myeloma]] treated with zoledronate who have had [[dental extraction]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Durie BG, Katz M, Crowley J |title=Osteonecrosis of the jaw and bisphosphonates |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=353 |issue=1 |pages=99–102; discussion 99–102 |year=2005 |pmid=16000365 |doi=10.1056/NEJM200507073530120}}</ref>

After approving the drug on 8 July 2009, the [[European Medicines Agency]] conducted a class review of all [[bisphosphonates]], including Zoledronate, after several cases of atypical fractures were reported.<ref name="ema.europa.eu">{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/public_health_alerts/2011/04/human_pha_detail_000027.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d126|title=European Medicines Agency - Human medicines|work=europa.eu}}</ref> In 2008, the EMA's Pharmacovigilance Working Party (PhVWP) noted that [[alendronic acid]] was associated with an increased risk of atypical fracture of the [[femur]] that developed with low or no trauma. In April 2010, the PhVWP noted that further data from both the published literature and post-marketing reports were now available which suggested that atypical stress fractures of the femur may be a class effect. The [[European Medicines Agency]] then reviewed all case reports of stress fractures in patients treated with bisphosphonates, relevant data from the published literature, and data provided by the companies which market bisphosphonates. The Agency recommended that doctors who prescribe bisphosphonate-containing medicines should be aware that atypical fractures may occur rarely in the femur, especially after long-term use, and that doctors who are prescribing these medicines for the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis should regularly review the need for continued treatment, especially after five or more years of use.<ref name="ema.europa.eu"/>

==Mechanism of action==

Zoledronic acid slows down [[bone resorption]], allowing the bone-forming cells time to rebuild normal [[bone]] and allowing [[bone remodeling]].<ref>[http://www.nps.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/60945/nvcaclin.pdf Aclasta label- Australia]</ref>

==Research==
Zoledronic acid has been found to have a direct antitumor effect and to synergistically augment the effects of other antitumor agents in [[osteosarcoma]] cells.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 20514467 | volume=24 | issue=1 | title=Zoledronic acid inhibits proliferation of human fibrosarcoma cells with induction of apoptosis, and shows combined effects with other anticancer agents |date=July 2010 | journal=Oncol.
