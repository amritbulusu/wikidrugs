'''Defibrotide''', sold under the brandname '''Defitelio''', is a mixture of single-stranded [[oligonucleotide]]s that is purified from the [[intestinal mucosa]] of pigs.<ref name=UKlabel/>  It is used to treat [[veno-occlusive disease]] of the liver of people having had a [[bone marrow transplant]].<ref name=UKlabel>{{cite web|title=Defitelio 80 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion - Summary of Product Characteristics|url=https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/31111|publisher=UK Electronic Medicines Compendium|accessdate=20 July 2017|date=26 May 2016}}</ref>   It works by protecting the cells lining bloods vessels and preventing blood clotting; the way it does this is not well understood. 

There is a strong risk of bleeding in the brain, eyes, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, and nose.  Some people have hypersensitivity reactions.<ref name=UKlabel/>

It was approved in Europe in 2013 and in the US in 2014. 

==Medical uses==
Defibrotide is used to treat [[veno-occlusive disease]] of the liver of people having had a [[bone marrow transplant]].<ref name=UKlabel/><ref name=USlabel>{{cite web|title=Defibrotide sodium label|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2016/208114Orig1s000Lbl.pdf|publisher=FDA|accessdate=20 July 2017|date=March 2016}} For label updates see [https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=overview.process&varApplNo=208114 FDA index page for NDA 208114]</ref> As of 2016, however, [[randomized placebo controlled trials]] have not been done.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dalle|first1=JH|last2=Giralt|first2=SA|title=Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation: Risk Factors and Stratification, Prophylaxis, and Treatment.|journal=Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation|date=March 2016|volume=22|issue=3|pages=400-9|doi=10.1016/j.bbmt.2015.09.024|pmid=26431626}}</ref>

It is administered by intravenous infusion in a doctor's office or clinic.<ref name=UKlabel/>

Pregnant women should not take defibrotide and women should not become pregnant while taking it; it has not been tested in pregnant but at normal doses it caused hemolytic abortion in rats. <ref name=UKlabel/>

==Contraindications==
Use of defibrotide for people who are already taking [[anticoagulants]] is dangerous and use of other drugs that affect platelet aggregation, like [[NSAID]]s, should be done with care.  Defibrotide should not be given to people who have a difficult time maintaining a steady [[blood pressure]].<ref name=UKlabel/>

==Adverse effects==
There is a strong risk of hemorrhage and some people have had hypersensitivity reactions to defibrotide.<ref name=UKlabel/><ref name=USlabel/>

Common adverse effects, occurring in between 1 and 10% of people, included impaired blood clotting, [[cerebral hemorrhage]], bleeding in the eyes, low blood pressure, bleeding lungs, bleeding stomach or intestines, vomiting, blood in the urine, and bleeding at catheterization sites.<ref name=UKlabel/>

Other side effects have included diarrhea, nosebleeds, sepsis, [[graft vs host disease]], pneumonia, and infections.<ref name=USlabel/>

==Pharmacology==
The mechanism of action is not well understood.   ''In vitro'' studies have shown that it protects the [[endothelium]] lining blood vessels from damage by [[fludarabine]], a [[chemotherapy]] drug, and from a few other insults like serum starvation.   It also appears to increase [[t-PA]] function and decrease [[plasminogen activator inhibitor-1]] activity.<ref name=UKlabel/><ref name=USlabel/>

==Chemistry==
Defibrotide is a mixture of single-stranded [[oligonucleotide]]s.   The chemical name is polydeoxyribonucleotide, sodium salt.<ref name=USlabel/>  It is purified from the [[intestinal mucosa]] of pigs.<ref name=UKlabel/>

==Society and culture==
Defibrotide was approved in Europe for use in treating veno-occlusive disease of the liver of people having had a bone marrow transplant in 2013; Gentium had [[drug development|developed]] it.<ref name=genengnews20140115>{{cite news|title=Jazz Pharma Acquiring Gentium for $1B|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/jazz-pharma-acquiring-gentium-for-1b/81249275|work=GEN Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News|date=December 20, 2013}}</ref>  At the end of that year, [[Jazz Pharmaceuticals]] acquired Gentium.<ref name=genengnews20140115/>  In April 2016 the US FDA approved it for this use.<ref>[http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-complications/fda-approves-first-drug-severe-hepatic-vod-after-hsct FDA Approves First Drug for Severe Hepatic VOD After HSCT.
