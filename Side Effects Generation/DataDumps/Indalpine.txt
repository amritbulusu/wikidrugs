'''Indalpine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]]) (brand name '''Upstène'''; developmental code name '''LM-5008''') is an [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SSRI) class drug that was briefly marketed.<ref name="Elks2014">{{cite book|author=J. Elks|title=The Dictionary of Drugs: Chemical Data: Chemical Data, Structures and Bibliographies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0vXTBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA988|date=14 November 2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4757-2085-3|pages=988–}}</ref> It was discovered in 1977 by the pharmacologists Le Fur and Uzan at Pharmuka, a small French pharmaceutical firm, who credit Baron Shopsin and his colleagues at NYU-Bellevue/NYU School of Medicine in New York with providing the basis for their work.  They were particularly influenced by the series of "synthesis inhibitor studies" carried out by Shopsin's team during the early to mid-1970s, and in particular, the clinical report by Shopsin et al. (1976)<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 133650 | year = 1976 | last1 = Shopsin | first1 = B | last2 = Friedman | first2 = E | last3 = Gershon | first3 = S | title = Parachlorophenylalanine reversal of tranylcypromine effects in depressed patients | volume = 33 | issue = 7 | pages = 811–9 | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1976.01770070041003}}</ref> relating to [[fenclonine|PCPA]]'s rapid reversal of antidepressant response to [[tranylcypromine]] in [[depression (mood)|depressed]] patients. This led to an understanding of the role of the [[monoamine neurotransmitter]] [[serotonin]] (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5HT) in the therapeutic effects of the available [[tricyclic antidepressant|tricyclic]] and [[MAOI]] class antidepressants. The studies led to widespread recognition of a serotonin hypothesis of depression, contradicting theories that promoted the role of [[norepinephrine]].

==History==
<!--'''Indalpine: the first worldwide marketed SSRI and Designated Blockbuster''': -->
While [[citalopram]] (Lundbeck) and [[zimelidine]] (Astra Pharmaceuticals) were developed in the early-1970s, it was Pharmuka's indalpine that was first to reach the market. Dr. Shopsin was recruited as consultant to Pharmuka throughout a research and development process that resulted in the marketing of indalpine in France and then worldwide, in 1982. The therapeutic success, positive public response and media attention in France relating to Upstène (indalpine) spread worldwide, and indalpine was designated as a "blockbuster",{{clarify|date=April 2013|reason=designated by who?}} setting a new record for the sale of any antidepressant up to that point in time. With FDA approval of Pharmuka's IND submission to conduct clinical studies with indalpine and viqueline, Dr. Shopsin carried out and published the first clinical trials with these drugs in depressed outpatients in the U.S.<ref name=Shopsin1983>{{cite journal |vauthors=Shopsin B, Lefebvre C, Maulet C | title = Indalpine (LM-5008): An open study in depressed outpatients | journal = Curr Ther Res | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 239–252 | year = 1983}}</ref> Astra's SSRI zimelidine was marketed within a year (1983), but the next crop of SSRI's didn't become commercially available until the 1986 marketing of [[fluvoxamine]] in Belgium by Duphar, followed by approval in the United States later that year. Lilly's [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac) was approved in the US in 1987.
<!--'''Indalpine withdrawn and Fluoxetine (Prozac) marketed in 1987'''-->

Meanwhile, zimelidine had been withdrawn soon after its marketing in 1983 due to the emergence of [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]], a serious neurological disease. With lingering concerns among some Common Market countries and activist groups about the potential of SSRIs to induce adverse effects, and the reported association between indalpine and hematological effects, which emerged in the aftermath of Pharmuka's take over by [[Rhône Poulenc]], indalpine was abruptly taken off the market by Rhône Poulenc, to the surprise of others. Irish psychiatrist David Healy characterized indalpine as being "born at the wrong time" during a period when "indalpine and psychiatry was under siege" by different interest groups in some of the Common Market countries.<ref>3. From Book Let Em Eat Prozac by David Healy, 2004</ref> In line with indalpine's fate, research and development was halted relating to the 2 other 4-alkyl-piperidine derivatives developed by Pharmuka, [[viqualine]] (a [[serotonin releasing agent]]) and [[pipequaline]] (a [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor]] [[positive allosteric modulator]]), both in different stages of development at the time.[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aejaz_Ahmed/publication/270512329_Available_online_www_The_Importance_of_Six_Membered_Saturated_Nitrogen_Containing_Ring_in_Psychological_disorders/links/54acc5430cf21c47713a73a6.pdf]
