==Mechanism of action==
Retosiban is a competitive oxytocin receptor antagonist which blocks the oxytocin-mediated contraction of the uterine smooth muscle in the female uterus that occurs during the initiation of preterm labour.  This has been used to prevent preterm labour and [[premature birth]].

==Pharmacology==
Retosiban has been shown to be an effective [[tocolytic]]. By intravenous and oral administration it produces a dose-dependent decrease in oxytocin-induced uterine contractions in non-pregnant female rats. In late-term pregnant rats it significantly reduces spontaneous uterine contractions in a dose-dependent manner by intravenous administration.<ref name="pmid17395790" />
In humans retosiban prolongs pregnancy and reduces preterm birth. Intravenous administration of retosiban in women with spontaneous preterm labour was associated with a greater than 1-week increase in time to delivery compared with placebo, a significant reduction in preterm deliveries, a non-significant increase in uterine quiescence, and a favourable safety profile.  The results demonstrate proof-of-concept in the treatment of threatened spontaneous preterm labour <ref name="pmid25819462">{{ cite journal |vauthors=Thornton S, Miller H, Valenzuela G, Snidow J, Stier B, Fossler MJ, Montague TH, Powell M, Beach KJ | title = Treatment of spontaneous preterm labour with retosiban: a phase 2 proof‐of‐concept study | journal = British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 80 | issue = 4 | pages = 740–749 |date= October 2015| pmid = 25819462 | doi = 10.1111/bcp.12646| url =  }}</ref>

==Pharmacokinetics==
The oral bioavailability of retosiban is in the order of 100% in the rat with a half life of 1.4 hours.  It has low to moderate intrinsic clearance in [[microsomes]] from three pre-clinical species (rat, dog, cynomolgus monkey) and low intrinsic clearance in human microsomes.  It has a good [[cytochrome P450]] (Cyp450) profile with no significant inhibition, with IC50 > 100μM, low protein binding (<80%) and low predicted CNS penetration.<ref name="pmid20027670" />

== Physical and chemical properties==
At [[physiological pH]], retosiban exists in an uncharged state.  It has good solubility (> 0.22&nbsp;mg/ml), with a [[logd]] of 2.2.<ref name="pmid20027670" /> 
[[File:Phamacophore of Retosiban.svg|thumb|left|250px|Numbered structure of retosiban, showing the [[2,5-diketopiperazine]] [[pharmacophore]] required for good activity (in red) and the required (3''R'', 6''R'', 7''R'')-stereochemistry for optimal potency]]
Retosiban consists of a central 2,5 diketopiperazine ring with an ''R''-[[indanyl]] group at the 3 position and an ''R'' (''S''-secButyl) at the 6 position, both ''cis'' to each other, and with a ''R''-2-methyl [[oxazole]] ring at the 7 position in the acyclic amide attached to the N1-position.  Retosiban is the (3''R'', 6''R'', 7''R'')-isomer and is a sub-nanomolar (Ki = 0.65 nM) [[oxytocin receptor]] [[antagonist]], while the (3''R'', 6''R'', 7''S'')-isomer where the stereochemistry in the amide side-chain at C-7 is inverted, is 10-fold less potent.  Typically in this series of 2,5 diketopiperazine oxytocin  antagonists  the (3''S'', 6''S'', 7''S'') isomer is >500 less active than the (3''R'', 6''R'', 7''R'')-isomer.   In addition to the 2,5 diketopiperazine essential core, retosiban also contains several structural characteristics that improve its effectiveness and safety. An [[indanyl]] group at position 3 is the best choice in terms of oxytocin receptor antagonist potency, its replacement by phenethyl and benzyl groups led to a progressive weakening of activity. At C-3, a 4-carbon branched alkyl was shown to be preferred with ''R'' (''S''-secButyl) being the best; smaller alkyl groups result in reduced antagonist activity.<ref name="pmid20027670" />  The 2-methyl oxazole ring at the 7 position gives good aqueous solubility, low protein binding and minimal Cyp450 interaction.

== Synthesis==
Retosiban is a cyclic dipeptide or [[2,5-diketopiperazine]] and these are formed by cyclising the corresponding linear dipeptide.  In the short and highly [[stereoselective synthesis]] of Retosiban '''8''' the linear peptide '''5''' is formed by the four-component [[Ugi reaction]] of the [[carboxybenzyl]] (Cbz) protected R-indanylglycine '''1''', D-alloisoleucine methyl ester hydrochloride '''2''', 2-methyloxazole-4-carboxaldehyde '''3''' and 2-benzyloxyphenylisonitrile '''4'''.  Hydrogenation to remove the Cbz and benzyl protecting  groups, enabled cyclization of the linear peptide '''5''' to occur to give the phenolic cyclic dipeptide '''6'''. Hydrolysis of the phenolic amide, by reaction with [[carbonyl diimidazole]] (CDI), followed addition of aqueous hydrochloric acid gave the acid '''7''' which was converted to the amide Retosiban '''8''' by activating the acid with the peptide coupling reagent [[PyBOP]] (benzotriazol-1-yloxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate) followed by the addition of [[morpholine]].<ref name="pmid20027670" />
Although the linear peptide '''5''' and the cyclic dipeptide '''6''' are a mixture of [[diastereoisomers]] (7''RS'') at the exocyclic amide, the hydrochloric acid hydrolysis of the activated phenolic amide caused [[epimerisation]] at the exocyclic position and yielded the acid '''7''' with the required (7''R'')-stereochemistry as the major product.
