'''MMDA-2''' ('''2-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyamphetamine''') is a [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] [[drug]] of the [[substituted amphetamine|amphetamine]] class.<ref name="isbn0-9630096-0-5">{{cite book |author1=Ann Shulgin |author2=Alexander Shulgin | title = Pihkal: A Chemical Love Story | publisher = Transform Press | location = | year = 1991 | pages = | isbn = 0-9630096-0-5 | oclc = | doi = | url = http://isomerdesign.com/PiHKAL/read.php?domain=pk&id=133}}</ref> It is closely related to [[3-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyamphetamine|MMDA]] and [[3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine|MDA]].<ref name="isbn0-9630096-0-5"/>

[[Alexander Shulgin]] was likely the first to [[chemical synthesis|synthesize]] MMDA-2.<ref name="isbn0-9630096-0-5"/> In his book ''[[PiHKAL]]'', the dose is listed as 25–50&nbsp;mg, and the duration is listed as 8–12 hours.<ref name="isbn0-9630096-0-5"/> Shulgin reports that MMDA-2 produces effects such as enhanced [[awareness]], [[empathy]], and [[mental imagery|visual facilitation]] and [[visual distortion|distortion]], as well as some [[side effect]]s like [[abdominal pain|gastrointestinal upset]] and [[appetite loss]].<ref name="isbn0-9630096-0-5"/> He states that 30&nbsp;mg is very similar to 80&nbsp;mg of MDA, and also remarks that it would be impossible for anyone to have a bad experience on the drug at that dose.<ref name="isbn0-9630096-0-5"/>

Scientific research has shown that MMDA-2, unlike MMDA, but similarly to [[6-methyl-MDA]], is only very weak at inducing the release of [[serotonin]] or [[dopamine]],<ref name="pmid1829838">{{cite journal |vauthors=McKenna DJ, Guan XM, Shulgin AT | title = 3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) analogues exhibit differential effects on synaptosomal release of 3H-dopamine and 3H-5-hydroxytryptamine | journal = Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Behavior | volume = 38 | issue = 3 | pages = 505–12 |date=March 1991 | pmid = 1829838 | doi = 10.1016/0091-3057(91)90005-M| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0091-3057(91)90005-M}}</ref> and accordingly, does not produce [[amphetamine]]-appropriate responding in animals in drug discrimination studies.<ref name="pmid3575369">{{cite journal |vauthors=Glennon RA, Yousif M, Naiman N, Kalix P | title = Methcathinone: a new and potent amphetamine-like agent | journal = Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Behavior | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | pages = 547–51 |date=March 1987 | pmid = 3575369 | doi = 10.1016/0091-3057(87)90164-X| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0091-3057(87)90164-X}}</ref> Instead, MMDA-2 is likely to act as a pure [[5-HT2 receptor|5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor]] [[agonist]] similarly to the [[DOx]] series of compounds, with activation of the [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor]] conferring its psychedelic effects.<ref name="pmid12602954">{{cite journal | author = Clare BW | title = QSAR of benzene derivatives: comparison of classical descriptors, quantum theoretic parameters and flip regression, exemplified by phenylalkylamine hallucinogens | journal = Journal of Computer-aided Molecular Design | volume = 16 | issue = 8–9 | pages = 611–33 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12602954 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021966231380| url = http://www.kluweronline.com/art.pdf?issn=0920-654X&volume=16&page=611}}</ref>
