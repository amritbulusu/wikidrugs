'''Dimetacrine''' (brand names '''Istonil''', '''Istonyl''', '''Linostil''', '''Miroistonil'''), also known as '''dimethacrine''' and '''acripramine''', is a [[tricyclic antidepressant]] (TCA) used in [[Europe]] and formerly in [[Japan]] for the treatment of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].<ref name="isbn0-412-54090-8">{{cite book | title = Dictionary of organic compounds | publisher = Chapman & Hall | location = London | year = 1996 | pages = | isbn = 0-412-54090-8 | oclc = | doi = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_8TyJT0RfN0C&lpg=PA2519}}</ref><ref name="urlAffective disorders: perspective on ... - Google Books">{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XLItppcgYugC&lpg=PA117 | title = Affective disorders: perspective on ... - Google Books | format = | work = | accessdate = }}</ref><ref name="isbn3-527-31058-4">{{cite book |author1=José Miguel Vela |author2=Helmut Buschmann |author3=Jörg Holenz |author4=Antonio Párraga |author5=Antoni Torrens | title = Antidepressants, Antipsychotics, Anxiolytics: From Chemistry and Pharmacology to Clinical Application | publisher = Wiley-VCH | location = Weinheim | year = 2007 | pages = | isbn = 3-527-31058-4 | oclc = | doi = | accessdate = }}</ref><ref name="pmid6008540">{{cite journal |vauthors=Taen S, Pöldinger W | title = [Dimethacrine (istonil), an acridane derivative with the antidepressive action] | language = German | journal = Schweizerische Medizinische Wochenschrift | volume = 96 | issue = 48 | pages = 1616–20 |date=December 1966 | pmid = 6008540 | doi = | url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid5756370">{{cite journal | author = Meyer R | title = [Contribution to the clinical evaluation of the antidepressive effect of dimethacrine (Istonil)] | language = German | journal = Praxis | volume = 57 | issue = 20 | pages = 721–3 |date=May 1968 | pmid = 5756370 | doi = | url = }}</ref> It has [[imipramine]]-like effects; though, in a [[Blind experiment#Double-blind trials|double-blind]] [[clinical trial]] against imipramine, dimetacrine was found to have lower efficacy in comparison and produced more [[weight loss]] and abnormal [[liver function tests|liver test]]s.<ref name="pmid4149236">{{cite journal | author = Abuzzahab FS | title = A double-blind investigation of dimethacrine versus imipramine in hospitalized depressive states | journal = International Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, Therapy and Toxicology | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 244–53 |date=November 1973 | pmid = 4149236 | doi = | url = }}</ref><ref name="isbn0-8493-7774-9">{{cite book | author = Mutschler, Ernst | author2 = Derendorf, Hartmut | title = Drug actions: basic principles and therapeutic aspects | publisher = Medpharm Scientific Pub | location = Stuttgart, Germany | year = 1995 | pages = | isbn = 0-8493-7774-9 | oclc = | doi = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IvN4mZxraMkC&lpg=PA127&dq=dimetacrine&lr=&as_brr=3&pg=PA127#v=onepage&q=&f=false | accessdate = January 30, 2013}}</ref> Little is known about the [[pharmacology]] of dimetacrine, but it can be inferred that it acts in a similar manner to other TCAs.
