'''Pregnenolone''' ('''P5'''), or '''pregn-5-en-3β-ol-20-one''', is an [[endogenous]] [[steroid]] and [[precursor (biochemistry)|precursor]]/[[metabolic intermediate]] in the [[biosynthesis]] of most of the [[steroid hormone]]s, including the [[progestogen]]s, [[androgen]]s, [[estrogen]]s, [[glucocorticoid]]s, and [[mineralocorticoid]]s.

==Biological activity==

===Neurosteroid activity===
Pregnenolone and its 3β-[[sulfate]], pregnenolone sulfate, like DHEA, [[DHEA sulfate]], and progesterone, belong to the group of [[neuroactive steroid|neurosteroid]]s that are found in high concentrations in certain areas of the brain, and are synthesized there. Neurosteroids affect synaptic functioning, are [[neuroprotective]], and enhance [[myelin]]ization. Pregnenolone and its sulfate ester are under investigation for their potential to improve cognitive and [[memory]] functioning.<ref name="pmid11744095">{{cite journal |vauthors=Vallée M, Mayo W, Le Moal M | title = Role of pregnenolone, dehydroepiandrosterone and their sulfate esters on learning and memory in cognitive aging | journal = Brain Research.

==Biochemistry==
[[File:Steroidogenesis.svg|right|thumb|450px|[[Steroidogenesis]], showing pregnenolone near top left.]]

===Biosynthesis===
Pregnenolone is [[biosynthesis|synthesized]] from [[cholesterol]]. This [[biotransformation|conversion]] involves  [[hydroxylation]] of the [[side chain]] at the C20 and C22 positions, with [[bond cleavage|cleavage]] of the [[side chain]]. The [[enzyme]] performing this task is [[P450scc|cytochrome P450scc]], located in the [[mitochondria]], and controlled by [[anterior pituitary]] [[trophic hormone]]s, such as [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]], [[follicle-stimulating hormone]], and [[luteinizing hormone]], in the [[adrenal gland]]s and [[gonad]]s. There are two [[metabolic intermediate|intermediate]]s in the transformation of cholesterol into pregnenolone, [[22R-hydroxycholesterol|22''R''-hydroxycholesterol]] and [[20α,22R-dihydroxycholesterol|20α,22''R''-dihydroxycholesterol]], and all three steps in the transformation are catalyzed by P450scc.

To assay conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, radiolabelled cholesterol has been used.<ref name="HanukogluJefcoate1980">{{cite journal|vauthors=Hanukoglu I, Jefcoate CR | title = Pregnenolone separation from cholesterol using Sephadex LH-20 mini-columns | journal = Journal of Chromatography A | year = 1980 | volume = 190 | issue = 1 | pages = 256–262 | doi = 10.1016/S0021-9673(00)85545-4 }}</ref> Pregnenolone product can be separated from cholesterol substrate using Sephadex LH-20 minicolumns.<ref name="HanukogluJefcoate1980" />

Pregnenolone is produced mainly in the [[gonad]]s, [[adrenal gland]]s, and the [[brain]].<ref name="pmid26433186">{{cite journal | vauthors = Vallée M | title = Neurosteroids and potential therapeutics: Focus on pregnenolone | journal = J.

===Metabolism===
Pregnenolone undergoes further steroid [[metabolism]] in one of several ways:

* Pregnenolone can be converted into [[progesterone]]. The critical enzyme step is two-fold using a [[3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]] and a [[delta 5-4 isomerase|Δ<sup>5-4</sup> isomerase]]. The latter transfers the [[double bond]] from C5 to C4 on the A ring.  Progesterone is the entry into the Δ<sup>4</sup> pathway, resulting in production of [[17α-hydroxyprogesterone]] and [[androstenedione]], precursor to [[testosterone]] and [[estrone]]. [[Aldosterone]] and [[corticosteroid]]s are also derived from progesterone or its derivatives.
* Pregnenolone can be converted to [[17α-hydroxypregnenolone]] by the enzyme 17α-hydroxylase ([[CYP17A1]]). Using this pathway, termed Δ<sup>5</sup> pathway, the next step is conversion to [[dehydroepiandrosterone]] (DHEA) via 17,20-lyase (CYP17A1). DHEA is the precursor of androstenedione.
* Pregnenolone can be converted to [[androstadienol]] by 16-ene synthase (CYP17A1).
* Pregnenolone can be converted to [[pregnenolone sulfate]] by [[steroid sulfotransferase]], and this conversion can be reversed by [[steroid sulfatase]].

==Pharmacology==
[[Oral administration]] of 50 or 100&nbsp;mg pregnenolone has been found to have minimal or negligible effect on [[urine|urinary]] levels of [[testosterone]] and testosterone [[metabolite]]s, including of [[androsterone]], [[etiocholanolone]], [[5β-androstanediol]], [[androstadienol]], and [[androstenol]] (and/or their [[conjugation (biochemistry)|conjugate]]s), and this suggests that only a small amount of pregnenolone is converted into testosterone.<ref name="pmid15763596">{{cite journal | vauthors = Saudan C, Desmarchelier A, Sottas PE, Mangin P, Saugy M | title = Urinary marker of oral pregnenolone administration | journal = Steroids | volume = 70 | issue = 3 | pages = 179–83 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15763596 | doi = 10.1016/j.steroids.2004.12.007 | url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid21538944">{{cite journal | vauthors = Piper T, Schlug C, Mareck U, Schänzer W | title = Investigations on changes in ¹³C/¹²C ratios of endogenous urinary steroids after pregnenolone administration | journal = Drug Test Anal | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | pages = 283–90 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21538944 | doi = 10.1002/dta.281 | url = }}</ref> This is in accordance with findings on the conversion of DHEA into testosterone, in which only 1.5% of an oral dose of DHEA was found to be converted into testosterone.<ref name="pmid15763596" /> In contrast to the [[androstane]]s, 50 or 100&nbsp;mg oral pregnenolone has been found to significantly and in fact "strongly" increase urinary levels of the progesterone metabolites [[pregnanediol]] and [[pregnanolone]] (and/or their conjugates), whereas [[pregnanetriol]] was unaffected.<ref name="pmid15763596" /><ref name="pmid21538944" /> Unlike the case of oral administration, [[transdermal administration]] of 30&nbsp;mg/day pregnenolone cream has not been found to affect urinary levels of metabolites of any other steroids, including of progesterone.<ref name="pmid21538944" />

Pregnenolone is also known chemically as '''pregn-5-en-3β-ol-20-one'''. Like other [[steroid]]s, it consists of four interconnected [[cyclic hydrocarbon]]s. The compound contains [[ketone]] and [[hydroxyl]] [[functional group]]s, two [[methyl]] branches, and a [[double bond]] at C5, in the B cyclic hydrocarbon ring. Like many steroid hormones, it is [[hydrophobic]]. The [[sulfated]] derivative, [[pregnenolone sulfate]], is water-soluble.

[[3β-Dihydroprogesterone]] (pregn-4-en-3β-ol-20-one) is an [[isomer]] of pregnenolone in which the C5 [[double bond]] has been replaced with a C4 double bond.
