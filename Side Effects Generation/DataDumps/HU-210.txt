==Effects and research==

The (+) [[enantiomer]] of HU-210 has almost all of the cannabinoid activity, with the (−) enantiomer [[HU-211]] being inactive as a [[cannabinoid]] but instead acting as an [[NMDA antagonist]] having [[neuroprotective]] effects.<ref>{{Cite journal| last1 = Howlett | first1 = A.| last2 = Champion | first2 = T.| last3 = Wilken | first3 = G.| last4 = Mechoulam | first4 = R.| title = Stereochemical effects of 11-OH-Δ8-tetrahydrocannabinol-dimethylheptyl to inhibit adenylate cyclase and bind to the cannabinoid receptor| journal = Neuropharmacology| volume = 29| issue = 2| pages = 161–5| year = 1990| pmid = 2158635| doi = 10.1016/0028-3908(90)90056-W}}</ref><ref name="pmid14534855">{{cite journal |author=Darlington CL |title=Dexanabinol: a novel cannabinoid with neuroprotective properties |journal=IDrugs : the Investigational Drugs Journal |volume=6 |issue=10 |pages=976–9 |date=October 2003 |pmid=14534855 }}</ref>

HU-210, alongside other synthetic cannabinoids like [[WIN 55,212-2]] and [[JWH-133]], is implicated in preventing the inflammation caused by [[amyloid beta]] proteins involved in [[Alzheimer's disease]], in addition to preventing cognitive impairment and loss of neuronal markers. This anti-inflammatory action is induced through the activation of [[cannabinoid receptor]]s, which prevents [[microglia]]l activation that elicits the inflammation. In addition, cannabinoids completely abolish neurotoxicity related to microglia activation in rat models.<ref name="pmid15728830">{{Cite journal

HU-210 is a potent [[analgesic]] with many of the same effects as natural THC.

==Chemistry==

HU-210 is the [[enantiomer]] of [[HU-211]] ([[Dexanabinol]]). The original synthesis of HU-210 is based on an acid-catalyzed condensation of (–)-[[Myrtenol]] and [[1,1-Dimethylheptylresorcinol]] (3,5-Dihydroxy-1-(1,1-dimethylheptyl)benzol).<ref>R. Mechoulam, N. Lander, A. Breuer, J. Zahalka: In Synthesis of the Individual, Pharmacologically Distinct, Enantiomers of a Tetrahydrocannabinol Derivative. Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 1990, 5, 315-318.</ref>

==Recreational use==
According to the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]], HU-210 was discovered in [[Spice (drug)|Spice Gold]] incense products seized at the US border in January 2009. Over {{convert|100|lb}} of Spice products were seized based on this finding.<ref name="urlLab">{{cite web |url=http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/newsroom/news_releases/01142009_3.xml |title=Lab Results Confirm CBP in Ohio Discover Synthetic Narcotics in Incense Packets - CBP.gov }}</ref> HU-210 was also detected in three Spice products in the UK, as reported in June 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_80086_EN_EMCDDA_Understanding%20the%20‘Spice’%20phenomenon_1Update%2020090514.pdf|title=EMCDDA Action on new drugs briefing paper: Understanding the ‘Spice’ phenomenon}}</ref>

==Legal status==
HU-210 is not listed in the schedules set out by the [[United Nations]]' [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] from 1961 nor their [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]] from 1971,<ref name="UNCPS">[https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/commissions/CND/conventions.html UN International Drug Control Conventions]</ref> so the signatory countries to these international drug control treaties are not required by said treaties to control HU-210.

===New Zealand===
HU-210 is banned in New Zealand as of 8 May 2014.<ref>https://www.drugfoundation.org.nz/synthetic-cannabinoids/what-they-are</ref>

===United States===
HU-210 is not listed in the [[List_of_Schedule_I_drugs_(US)|list of scheduled controlled substances]] in the USA.<ref name="PART 1308 — SCHEDULES OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES - 1308.11 Schedule I">[http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1308/1308_11.htm §1308.11 Schedule I.]</ref> It is therefore not [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedules of controlled substances|scheduled]] at the [[Federal government of the United States|federal level]] in the United States, but it is possible that HU-210 could legally be considered an [[Structural analog#Chemistry|analog]] of Delta-8-THC (which is one of the substances controlled in Schedule I as "tetrahydrocannabinols"), and therefore sales or [[Drug possession|possession]] could potentially be prosecuted under the [[Federal Analogue Act]].<ref>[https://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/law/analog/analog_info1.shtml Erowid Analog Law Vault : Federal Controlled Substance Analogue Act Summary]</ref> A brief profile of HU-210 written and published by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) in 2009 (but subsequently removed from the DEA's website several years later) stated that HU-210 is a Schedule I controlled substance under the [[Controlled Substances Act]] due to being similar to [[THC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117131045/http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drugs_concern/spice/spice_hu210.htm|title=Spice Cannabinoid - HU-210}}</ref> This indicates that the DEA might legally consider HU-210 to be an analogue of Delta-8-THC for the purposes of applying the Federal Analog Act to those that handle HU-210. An elucidation of the rational for the DEA's claim was not presented, no references were cited, and the claim was eventually removed from the DEA's website. A version of the document (updated in 2013), now in PDF form, exists on the DEA Office of Diversion Control's website.<ref>''[http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_chem_info/spice/spice_hu210.pdf HU-210 [(6aR,10aR)-9-(hydroxymethyl)-6,6-dimethyl-3-(2-methyloctan-2-yl)-6a,7,10,10a-tetrahydrobenzo[c] chromen-1-ol)] [Purported Ingredient of “Spice”]]'' ([[PDF]]).
