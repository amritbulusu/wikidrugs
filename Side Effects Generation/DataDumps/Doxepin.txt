'''Doxepin''', sold under the brand names '''Sinequan''' and '''Silenor''' among others, is an [[antidepressant]] and [[hypnotic|sleep aid]] medication used to treat [[clinical depression|depression]] and [[insomnia|trouble sleeping]].<ref name = MD>{{cite web|title=Doxepin Hydrochloride|work=Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference|publisher=Pharmaceutical Press|date=30 January 2013|accessdate=3 December 2013|url=http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/martindale/current/2513-s.htm|location=London, UK}}</ref> It belongs to a class of antidepressants known as the [[tricyclic antidepressants]] (TCAs). It is believed to counteract depression by [[reuptake inhibitor|inhibiting]] the [[reuptake]] of [[serotonin]] and [[norepinephrine]] (via blocking their [[neurotransmitter transporter|transporter]]s), thereby increasing the concentrations of these [[neurotransmitter]]s in the [[synapse]] and increasing the activity of their respective [[neurotransmitter receptor|receptor]]s. The drug also has [[antiadrenergic]], [[antihistamine]], [[antiserotonergic]], and [[anticholinergic]] activities, which are thought to contribute largely to its [[side effect]]s. At very low doses, it is a pure antihistamine and is used in the treatment of [[insomnia]].<ref name="pmid20658801" />

==Overdose==
{{Main|Tricyclic antidepressant overdose}}

Like other TCAs, doxepin is highly [[toxicity|toxic]] in cases of [[overdose]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=White, N |author2=Litovitz, T |author3=Clancy, C | date = December 2008 | title = Suicidal antidepressant overdoses: a comparative analysis by antidepressant type | journal = Journal of Medical Toxicology | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = 238–250 | pmid = 19031375 | pmc = 3550116 | doi = 10.1007/BF03161207 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3550116/pdf/13181_2009_Article_BF03161207.pdf}}</ref> Mild symptoms include drowsiness, stupor, blurred vision, and excessive dryness of mouth. More serious adverse effects include respiratory depression, hypotension, coma, convulsions, cardiac arrhythmia, and tachycardia. [[Urinary retention]], decreased gastrointestinal motility (paralytic ileus), [[hyperthermia]] (or hypothermia), hypertension, dilated pupils, and hyperactive reflexes are other possible symptoms of doxepin overdose.<ref name = EMC/> Management of overdose is mostly supportive and symptomatic, and can include the administration of a [[gastric lavage]] so as to reduce absorption of the doxepin.<ref name = EMC/> Supportive measures to prevent respiratory aspiration is also advisable.<ref name = EMC/> Antiarrhythmic agents may be an appropriate measure to treat cardiac arrhythmias resulting from doxepin overdose.<ref name = EMC/> Slow intravenous administration of [[physostigmine]] may reverse some of the toxic effects of overdose such as anticholinergic effects.<ref name = EMC/> [[Haemodialysis]] is not recommended due to the high degree of protein binding with doxepin.<ref name = EMC/> ECG monitoring is recommended for several days after doxepin overdose due to the potential for cardiac conduction abnormalities.<ref name = EMC/>

==Interactions==
Doxepin should not be used within 14&nbsp;days of using a [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]] (MAOIs) such as [[phenelzine]] due to the potential for [[hypertensive crisis]] or [[serotonin syndrome]] to develop.<ref name = TGA/> Its use in those taking [[potency (pharmacology)|potent]] [[CYP2D6]] inhibitors such as [[fluoxetine]], [[paroxetine]], [[sertraline]], [[duloxetine]], [[bupropion]], and [[quinidine]] is recommended against due to the potential for its accumulation in the absence of full CYP2D6 catalytic activity.<ref name = TGA/> Hepatic enzyme inducers such as [[carbamazepine]], [[phenytoin]], and [[barbiturate]]s are advised against in patients receiving TCAs like doxepin due to the potential for problematically rapid metabolism of doxepin to occur in these individuals.<ref name = TGA/> Sympathomimetic agents may have their effects potentiated by TCAs like doxepin.<ref name = TGA/> Doxepin also may potentiate the adverse effects of anticholinergic agents such as [[benztropine]], [[atropine]] and [[hyoscine hydrobromide|hyoscine]] (scopolamine).<ref name = TGA/> [[Tolazamide]], when used in conjunction with doxepin has been associated with a case of severe hypoglycaemia in a [[type II diabetes mellitus|type II diabetic]] individual.<ref name = TGA/> [[Cimetidine]] may influence the absorption of doxepin.<ref name = TGA/> Alcohol may potentiate some of the CNS depressant effects of doxepin.<ref name = TGA/> Antihypertensive agents may have their effects mitigated by doxepin.<ref name = TGA/> Cotreatment with CNS depressants such as the [[benzodiazepines]] can cause additive CNS depression.<ref name = EMC/> Co-treatment with [[thyroid hormone]]s may also increase the potential for adverse reactions.<ref name = EMC/>

Based on its {{abbrlink|IC<sub>50</sub>|half-maximal inhibitory concentration}} values for monoamine reuptake inhibition, doxepin is relatively selective for inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake with much weaker effects on serotonin reuptake and negligible influence on dopamine reuptake.<ref name="pmid9537821" /><ref name="pmid23357028" />

The [[effect size]]s of very-low-dose doxepin in the treatment of insomnia range from small to medium.<ref name="pmid25047681" /> These include subjective and objective measures of sleep maintenance, sleep duration, and sleep efficiency.<ref name="pmid25047681" /> Conversely, very-low-dose doxepin shows relatively weak effects on sleep initiation and does not significantly separate from placebo on this measure.<ref name="pmid25047681" /> This is in contrast to [[benzodiazepine]]s and [[nonbenzodiazepine]] ([[Z-drug]]) hypnotics, which are additionally effective in improving sleep onset latency.<ref name="pmid25047681" /> However, it is also in contrast to higher doses of doxepin (50 to 300&nbsp;mg/day), which ''have'' been found to significantly reduce latency to sleep onset.<ref name="pmid25047681" /> A positive [[dose–response relationship]] on sleep measures was observed for doses of doxepin between 1 and 6&nbsp;mg in clinical studies, whereas the incidence of adverse effects remained constant across this dose range in both young and older adults.<ref name="pmid25047681" /> However, the incidence of adverse effects appeared to increase with longer treatment duration.<ref name="pmid25047681" /> A dose of doxepin as low as 1&nbsp;mg/day was found to significantly improve most of the assessed sleep measures, but unlike the 3 and 6&nbsp;mg/day doses, was not able to improve wake time during sleep.<ref name="pmid25047681" /> This, along with greater effect sizes with the higher doses, was likely the basis for the approval of the 3 and 6&nbsp;mg doses of doxepin for insomnia and not the 1&nbsp;mg dose.<ref name="pmid25047681" />

At very low doses, doxepin has not shown [[drug discontinuation|discontinuation]] or [[drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] effects nor [[rebound insomnia]].<ref name="pmid20658801" /> Sustained effectiveness without apparent tolerance was demonstrated in clinical studies of up to 12&nbsp;weeks duration.<ref name="pmid23229983" /> This appears to be in contrast to over-the-counter antihistamines like diphenhydramine and doxylamine and all other first-generation antihistamines, which are associated with rapid development of [[drug tolerance|tolerance]] and [[drug dependence|dependence]] (by day 3 or 4 of continuous dosing) and loss of hypnotic effectiveness.<ref name="pmid23229983" /> It is for this reason that, unlike doxepin, they are not recommended for the chronic management of insomnia and are advised for only short-term treatment (i.e., 1&nbsp;week).<ref name="pmid23229983" /> It is not entirely clear why doxepin and first-generation antihistamines are different in this regard, but it has been suggested that it may have to do with the lack of [[binding selectivity|selectivity]] for the H<sub>1</sub> receptor of the latter or may have to do with the use of optimal doses.<ref name="pmid19179941" /> Unlike very-low-dose doxepin, most first-generation antihistamines also have marked anticholinergic activity as well as associated side effects such as dry mouth, [[constipation]], [[urinary retention]], and [[confusion]].<ref name="pmid23229983" /> This is particularly true in older people, and antihistamines with concomitant anticholinergic effects are not recommended in adults over the age of 65.<ref name="pmid23229983" /> Anticholinergic activity notably may interfere with the sleep-promoting effects of H<sub>1</sub> receptor blockade.<ref name="pmid23357028" />

Doxepin at a dose of 25&nbsp;mg/day for 3&nbsp;weeks has been found to decrease [[cortisol]] levels by 16% in adults with chronic insomnia and to increase [[melatonin]] production by 26% in healthy volunteers.<ref name="pmid20658801" /> In individuals with neuroendocrine dysregulation in the form of nocturnal melatonin deficiency presumably due to chronic insomnia, very-low-dose doxepin was found to restore melatonin levels to near-normal values after 3&nbsp;weeks of treatment.<ref name="pmid17685877" /> These findings suggest that normalization of the [[hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis]] and the [[circadian sleep–wake cycle]] may be involved in the beneficial effects of doxepin on sleep and insomnia.<ref name="pmid20658801" /><ref name="pmid17685877" />

Doxepin is well-[[absorption (pharmacokinetics)|absorbed]] from the [[gastrointestinal tract]] but between 55 and 87% undergoes [[first-pass metabolism]] in the [[liver]],<ref name="pmid20658801" /> resulting in a mean [[oral administration|oral]] [[bioavailability]] of approximately 29%.<ref name="pmid12162857">{{cite journal | vauthors = Yan JH, Hubbard JW, McKay G, Korchinski ED, Midha KK | title = Absolute bioavailability and stereoselective pharmacokinetics of doxepin | journal = Xenobiotica | volume = 32 | issue = 7 | pages = 615–23 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12162857 | doi = 10.1080/00498250210131879 | url = }}</ref> Following a single very low dose of 6&nbsp;mg, peak plasma levels of doxepin are 0.854&nbsp;ng/mL (3.06&nbsp;nmol/L) at 3&nbsp;hours without food and 0.951&nbsp;ng/mL (3.40&nbsp;nmol/L) at 6&nbsp;hours with food.<ref name="pmid20658801" /> Plasma concentrations of doxepin with antidepressant doses are far greater, ranging between 50 to 250&nbsp;ng/mL (180 to 900&nbsp;nmol/L).<ref name="pmid11476128">{{cite journal | vauthors = Leucht S, Steimer W, Kreuz S, Abraham D, Orsulak PJ, Kissling W | title = Doxepin plasma concentrations: is there really a therapeutic range? | journal = J Clin Psychopharmacol | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 432–9 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11476128 | doi = | url = }}</ref> [[Area-under-curve (pharmacokinetics)|Area-under-curve]] levels of the drug are increased significantly when it is taken with food.<ref name="pmid20658801" />

====Distribution====
Doxepin is widely [[distribution (pharmacology)|distributed]] throughout the body and is approximately 80% [[plasma protein binding|plasma protein-bound]], specifically to [[human serum albumin|albumin]] and [[orosomucoid|α<sub>1</sub>-acid glycoprotein]].<ref name="pmid20658801" /><ref name="pmid7113722">{{cite journal | vauthors = Virtanen R, Iisalo E, Irjala K | title = Protein binding of doxepin and desmethyldoxepin | journal = Acta Pharmacol Toxicol (Copenh) | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 159–64 | year = 1982 | pmid = 7113722 | doi = | url = }}</ref>

====Metabolism====
Doxepin is extensively [[metabolism|metabolized]] by the [[liver]] via [[oxidation]] and ''N''-[[demethylation]].<ref name="pmid20658801" /> Based on ''[[in vitro]]'' research, the major [[enzyme]]s involved in the metabolism of doxepin are the [[cytochrome P450]] enzymes [[CYP2D6]] and [[CYP2C19]], with [[CYP1A2]], [[CYP2C9]], and [[CYP3A4]] also involved to a lesser extent.<ref name="pmid20658801" /><ref name="pmid12360109">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kirchheiner J, Meineke I, Müller G, Roots I, Brockmöller J | title = Contributions of CYP2D6, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 to the biotransformation of E- and Z-doxepin in healthy volunteers | journal = Pharmacogenetics | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = 571–80 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12360109 | doi = | url = }}</ref> The major active metabolite of doxepin, [[nordoxepin]], is formed mainly by CYP2C19 (>50% contribution), while CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 are involved to a lesser extent, and CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 are not involved.<ref name="pmid12180536">{{cite journal | vauthors = Härtter S, Tybring G, Friedberg T, Weigmann H, Hiemke C | title = The N-demethylation of the doxepin isomers is mainly catalyzed by the polymorphic CYP2C19 | journal = Pharm.

A study assessed the metabolism of a single 75&nbsp;mg oral dose of doxepin in healthy volunteers with [[genetic polymorphism]]s in CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 enzymes.<ref name="pmid12360109" /> In CYP2D6 [[extensive metabolizer|extensive]], [[intermediate metabolizer|intermediate]], and [[poor metabolizer]]s, the mean [[clearance (pharmacology)|clearance]] rates of (''E'')-doxepin were 406, 247, and 127&nbsp;L/hour, respectively (~3-fold difference between extensive and poor).<ref name="pmid12360109" /> In addition, the bioavailability of (''E'')-doxepin was about 2-fold lower in extensive relative to poor CYP2D6 metabolizers, indicating a significant role of CYP2D6 in the [[first-pass metabolism]] of (''E'')-doxepin.<ref name="pmid12360109" /> The clearance of (''E'')-doxepin in CYP2C9 [[slow metabolizer]]s was also significantly reduced at 238&nbsp;L/hour.<ref name="pmid12360109" /> CYP2C19 was involved in the metabolism of (''Z'')-doxepin, with clearance rates of 191&nbsp;L/hour in CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers and 73&nbsp;L/hour in poor metabolizers (~2.5-fold difference).<ref name="pmid12360109" /> [[Area-under-the-curve (pharmacokinetics)|Area-under-the-curve]] (0–48&nbsp;hour) levels of nordoxepin were dependent on the [[genotype]] of CYP2D6 with median values of 1.28, 1.35, and 5.28&nbsp;nM•L/hour in CYP2D6 extensive, intermediate, and poor metabolizers, respectively (~4-fold difference between extensive and poor).<ref name="pmid12360109" /> Taken together, doxepin metabolism appears to be highly [[stereoselectivity|stereoselective]], and CYP2D6 genotype has a major influence on the pharmacokinetics of (''E'')-doxepin.<ref name="pmid12360109" /> Moreover, CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, as well as patients taking potent CYP2D6 inhibitors (which can potentially convert a CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer into a poor metabolizer), may be at an increased risk for adverse effects of doxepin due to their slower clearance of the drug.<ref name="pmid12360109" />

Another study assessed doxepin and nordoxepin metabolism in CYP2D6 [[ultra-rapid metabolizer|ultra-rapid]], extensive, and poor metabolizers following a single 75&nbsp;mg oral dose.<ref name="pmid16007002" /> They found up to more than 10-fold variation in total exposure to doxepin and nordoxepin between the different groups.<ref name="pmid16007002" /> The researchers suggested that in order to achieve equivalent exposure, based on an average dose of 100%, the dosage of doxepin might be adjusted to 250% in ultra-rapid metabolizers, 150% in extensive metabolizers, 50% in intermediate metabolizers, and 30% in poor metabolizers.<ref name="pmid16007002" />

Nordoxepin is a [[mixture]] of [[Stereoisomerism#Cis–trans and E-Z isomerism|(''E'') and (''Z'')]] [[stereoisomer]]s similarly to doxepin.<ref name="LemkeWilliams2012" /> Whereas pharmaceutical doxepin is supplied in an approximate 85:15 ratio mixture of (''E'')- and (''Z'')-stereoisomers and plasma concentrations of doxepin remain roughly the same as this ratio with treatment, plasma levels of the (''E'')- and (''Z'')-stereoisomers of nordoxepin, due to stereoselective metabolism of doxepin by cytochrome P450 enzymes, are approximately 1:1.<ref name="LemkeWilliams2012" />

====Elimination====
Doxepin is [[elimination (pharmacology)|eliminated]] primarily in the [[urine]] and predominantly in the form of glucuronide conjugates, with less than 3% of a dose [[excretion|excreted]] unchanged as doxepin or nordoxepin.<ref name="pmid20658801" />

==Chemistry==
Doxepin is a [[tricyclic compound]], specifically a [[dibenzoxepin]], and possesses three [[ring (chemistry)|ring]]s fused together with a [[side chain]] attached in its [[chemical structure]].<ref name="pmid17685877" /> It is the only TCA with a dibenzoxepin [[ring system (chemistry)|ring system]] to have been marketed.<ref name="Ebadi2007">{{cite book|author=Manuchair Ebadi|title=Desk Reference of Clinical Pharmacology, Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ihxyHbnj3qYC&pg=PA329|date=31 October 2007|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-4744-8|pages=329–}}</ref> Doxepin is a [[tertiary amine]] TCA, with its [[side chain]]-[[demethylation|demethylated]] metabolite [[nordoxepin]] being a [[secondary amine]].<ref name="CutlerSramek1994"/><ref name="AnzenbacherZanger2012"/> Other tertiary amine TCAs include [[amitriptyline]], [[imipramine]], [[clomipramine]], [[dosulepin]] (dothiepin), and [[trimipramine]].<ref name="Anthony2002">{{cite book|author=Patricia K.
