==Medical use==
Guaifenesin is used to control cough and is sometimes combined with [[dextromethorphan]], an [[antitussive]] (cough medicine), such as in Mucinex DM or Robitussin DM.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/drugs/mono-704-GUAIFENESIN%2fDEXTROMETHORPHAN+-+ORAL.aspx?drugid=5508&drugname=Guaifenesin+DM+Oral&source=0 |title=Guaifenesin DM |publisher=webmd.com |date= |accessdate=}}</ref>

A 2008 [[Cochrane Collaboration]] meta-analysis of [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter medicines]] for acute cough in children and adults concluded that there was not enough high-quality clinical data to prove whether it is effective or not.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=SM|last2=Schroeder|first2=K|last3=Fahey|first3=T|title=Over-the-counter medications for acute cough in children and adults in ambulatory settings.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=23 January 2008|issue=1|pages=CD001831|pmid=18253996}}</ref>

==Side-effects==
Side-effects of guaifenesin include [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], formation of [[kidney stone]]s,<ref>{{cite journal

http://www.drugs.com/sfx/guaifenesin-side-effects.html</ref>  Nausea and vomiting can be reduced by taking guaifenesin with meals.<ref name="Drugs.com"/>  The risk of forming kidney stones during prolonged use can be reduced by maintaining good [[Rehydration|hydration]] and increasing the pH of urine. Rarely, severe allergic reactions may occur, including a rash or swelling of the lips or face, which may require urgent medical assistance.  Mild [[dry mouth]] or [[chapped lips]] may also occur when taking this medication. Drinking a glass of water is recommended with each dose of guaifenesin.<ref>Guaifenesin http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682494.html</ref>

Guaifenesin increases the [[analgesic]] effect of [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) and [[aspirin]], increases the sedative effects of alcohol, tranquilisers, sleep-pills and total anesthetics. Guaifenesin increases the effects of medication that decrease muscle tone.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Mechanism of action==
Guaifenesin is thought to act as an expectorant by increasing the volume and reducing the viscosity of secretions in the trachea and bronchi. It has been said to aid in the flow of respiratory tract secretions, allowing ciliary movement to carry the loosened secretions upward toward the pharynx.<ref>Gutierrez, K. (2007). Pharmacotherapeutics: Clinical Reasoning in Primary Care. W.B. Saunders Co.</ref> Thus, it may increase the efficiency of the cough reflex and facilitate removal of the secretions.

Guaifenesin has [[muscle relaxant]] and [[anticonvulsant]] properties and may be acting as an [[NMDA receptor antagonist]].<ref name="pmid23825891">{{cite journal | vauthors = Keshavarz M, Showraki A, Emamghoreishi M | title = Anticonvulsant Effect of Guaifenesin against Pentylenetetrazol-Induced Seizure in Mice | journal = Iran J Med Sci | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages = 116–21 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23825891 | pmc = 3700057 | doi = | url = }}</ref>

==History==
Similar medicines derived from the [[guaiacum|guaiac tree]] were in use as a generic remedy by American indigenous peoples when explorers reached [[North America]] in the 16th century. The Spanish encountered guaiacum wood "when they conquered Santo Domingo; it was soon brought back to Europe, where it acquired an immense reputation in the sixteenth century as a cure for syphilis and certain other diseases..."<ref name="Wallis1955">{{cite book |author=Wallis, Thomas E. |title=Textbook of Pharmacognosy|year=1955}}</ref>

The 1955  edition of the ''Textbook of [[Pharmacognosy]]'' states: "Guaiacum has a local stimulant action which is sometimes useful in sore throat. The resin is used in chronic gout and rheumatism, whilst the wood is an ingredient in the compound concentrated solution of [[Smilax regelii|sarsaparilla]], which was formerly much used as an alternative in syphilis."<ref name="Wallis1955" />

Guaifenesin was first approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1952. Although previously deemed "Generally Regarded as Safe" in its original approval, the drug received a New Drug Application for the extended-release version, which won approval on July 12, 2002.  Because of this, the FDA then issued letters to other manufacturers of ''timed-release'' guaifenesin to stop marketing their unapproved versions, leaving Adams Respiratory Therapeutics in control of the market. Adams was subsequently acquired by [[Reckitt Benckiser]], based on the strength of the marketing generated by Adams' Mucinex brand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rb.com/site/RKBR/Templates/MediaInvestorsGeneral2.aspx?pageid=262&cc=GB |title=Announcements RB Press release - 10/12/2007 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Jacob |last=Goldstein |title=FDA Bumps Phlegm-Fighters From Market |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/health/2007/05/25/fda-bumps-phlegm-fighters-from-market/ |date=25 May 2007 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref>

==Availability==
Guaifenesin is sold as pills or syrups under many [[brand name]]s.  Single-ingredient formulations of guaifenesin are available, and it is also included in many other over-the-counter cough and cold remedy combinations (usually in conjunction with [[dextromethorphan]], [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen), [[ephedrine]], [[pseudoephedrine]], or [[phenylephrine]]).

Combination guaifenesin and pseudoephedrine is sold under the brand name Mucinex D, in which "D" refers to the presence of pseudoephedrine, which is a "decongestant."<ref>{{cite web|title=Mucinex D Website|url=http://www.mucinex.com/products/sinus/mucinex-d/|website=mucinex.com|publisher=Reckitt Benckiser|accessdate=3 August 2017}}</ref>

==Veterinary use==
Guaifenesin's neurological properties first became known in the late 1940s.  Guaifenesin is a centrally acting muscle relaxant used routinely in large-animal veterinary surgery.  Guaifenesin is used in combination with, for example, [[propofol]], since guaifenesin does not produce analgesia nor does it produce unconsciousness.<ref>Tranquilli, W. J., Thurmon, J. C., and Grimm, K. A.  2007.  Lumb and Jones’ Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia.   Blackwell Publishing.

==Past Research==
The [[guaifenesin protocol]] was studied, as a method to treat [[fibromyalgia]], although a one-year double-blinded study found that the treatment performs no better than placebo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fmnetnews.com/resources-alert-product6.php |title=Consumer Alert&nbsp;— Guaifenesin for Fibromyalgia |publisher=Fmnetnews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04}}</ref><ref name=Bennett>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bennett RM, De Garmo P, Clark SR |title=A Randomized, Prospective, 12 Month Study To Compare The Efficacy Of Guaifenesin Versus Placebo In The Management Of Fibromyalgia |journal=Arthritis and Rheumatism |volume=39 |issue=Supplement9 |pages=S212 |year=1996 |url=http://www.myalgia.com/guaif2.htm |format=reprint |doi=10.1002/art.1780391402 }}</ref> Guaifenesin is not approved by the FDA for the treatment of fibromyalgia.

Guaifenesin was studied as a method to improve the possibility of [[fertilization|conception]], by thinning and increasing the stretchability (improved spinnbarkeit) of the [[cervical mucus]], during the few days before ovulation, thus facilitating sperm penetration.<ref name="tcoyf">{{cite book | first=Toni | last=Weschler | year=2002 | title=Taking Charge of Your Fertility | edition=Revised | publisher=HarperCollins | location=New York | isbn=0-06-093764-5 | page=52 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Check JH, Adelson HG, Wu CH | year = 1982 | title = Improvement of cervical factor with guaifenesin | url = | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 37 | issue = | page = 5 }}</ref>
