'''Ethylone''', also known as '''3,4-methylenedioxy-''N''-ethylcathinone''' ('''MDEC''', '''βk-MDEA'''), is [[recreational drug|recreational]] [[designer drug]] classified as an [[entactogen]], [[stimulant]], and [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] of the [[substituted phenethylamine|phenethylamine]], [[substituted amphetamine|amphetamine]], and [[substituted cathinone|cathinone]] [[chemical class]]es. It is the [[ketone|β-keto]] [[analogue (chemistry)|analogue]] of [[methylenedioxyethylamphetamine|MDEA]] ("Eve"). Ethylone has only a short history of human use and is reported to be less potent than its relative [[methylone]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} In the United States, it began to be found in cathinone products in late 2011.<ref name="jat">{{cite journal | url=http://jat.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/7/567 | title=Ethylone-Related Deaths: Toxicological Findings | author1=Dayong Lee | author2=Chris W.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of ethylone, but several ethylone-related deaths have been reported.<ref name=jat/>

==Pharmacokinetics==
Analysis of human and rat urine for the metabolites of [[substituted cathinone|bk-amphetamines]] suggested that ethylone was degraded in the following metabolic steps:<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00216-010-3636-5 | title=Beta-keto amphetamines: studies on the metabolism of the designer drug mephedrone and toxicological detection of mephedrone, butylone, and methylone in urine using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry | last=Meyer | first=Markus R | author2=Jens Wilhelm | author3=Frank T.

==Legal Status==

As of October 2015 Ethylone is a controlled substance in China.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sfda.gov.cn/WS01/CL0056/130753.html | title=关于印发《非药用类麻醉药品和精神药品列管办法》的通知 | publisher=China Food and Drug Administration | date=27 September 2015 | language=Chinese | accessdate=1 October 2015}}</ref>
