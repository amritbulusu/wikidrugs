'''Clofarabine''' is a [[purine]] [[nucleoside]] [[antimetabolite]] marketed in the US and Canada as '''Clolar'''. In Europe and Australia/New Zealand the product is marketed under the name '''Evoltra'''. It is FDA-approved for treating relapsed or refractory [[acute lymphoblastic leukaemia]] (ALL) in children after at least two other types of treatment have failed.  It is not known if it extends life expectancy.  Some investigations of effectiveness in cases of  [[acute myeloid leukaemia]] (AML) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML) have been carried out. Ongoing trials are assessing its efficacy, if any, for managing other cancers.

==Approval==
Clolar was [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved 28 December 2004. (Under accelerated approval regulations requiring further clinical studies.)

==Side effects==
* [[Tumor lysis syndrome]] (TLS). Clofarabine quickly kills leukaemia cells in the blood. The body may react to this. Signs include hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, and hyperphosphatemia.  TLS is very serious and can lead to death if it is not treated right away.
* Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS): symptoms include fast breathing, fast heartbeat, low blood pressure, and fluid in the lungs. 
*Bone marrow problems (suppression). Clofarabine can stop the bone marrow from making enough [[red blood cells]], [[white blood cells]], and [[platelets]]. Serious side effects that can happen because of bone marrow suppression include severe infection ([[sepsis]]), bleeding, and [[anemia]].
*Effects on [[pregnancy]] and [[breastfeeding]]. Girls and women should not become pregnant or breastfeed during treatment which may harm the baby.
*[[Dehydration]] and [[low blood pressure]]. Clofarabine can cause [[vomiting]] and [[diarrhea]] which may lead to low body fluid (dehydration). Signs and symptoms of dehydration include dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting spells, or decreased [[urination]].
*Other side effects. The most common side effects are stomach problems (including vomiting, diarrhea, and [[nausea]]), and effects on blood cells (including low red blood cells count, low white blood cell count, low platelet count, [[fever]], and infection. Clofarabine can also cause [[tachycardia]] and can affect the [[liver]] and [[kidneys]].

==Contraindications==

*pregnancy or planned pregnancy
*breast-feeding
*liver problems
*kidney problems

==Drug interactions==
*nephrotoxic drugs
*hepatotoxic drugs

==Delivery==
*By [[intravenous infusion]].
*Dosage is a 2-hour infusion (52&nbsp;mg/m²) every day for five days. The cycle is repeated every 2 to 6 weeks.
*Regular blood tests to monitor his or her blood cells, kidney function, and liver function.

==Biology==

Clofarabine is a second-generation purine nucleoside analog designed to overcome biological limitations observed with ara-A and fludarabine. A 2´(S)-fluorine in clofarabine significantly increased the stability of the glycosidic bond in acidic solution and toward phosphorolytic cleavage as compared to fludarabine. <ref name=" Parker 2003">{{cite journal |vauthors=Parker WB, Allan PW, Hassan AE, Secrist JA 3rd, Sorscher EJ, Waud WR | title =Antitumor activity of 2-fluoror-2’deoxyadenosine against tumors that express Esherichia coli purine nucleoside phosphorylase | journal = Cancer Gene Ther | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 23-29 | date=Jan 2003 | pmid = 12489025 | doi = 10.1038/sj.cgt.7700520 }}</ref> A chlorine substitution at the 2-position of the adenine base avoids production of a 2-fluoroadenine analog, a precursor to the toxic 2-fluoro-adenosine-5´-triphosphate and prevents deamination of the base as compared to ara-A.<ref name=" Bonate 2006">{{cite journal |vauthors=Bonate PL, Arthaud L, Cantrell WR Jr, Stephenson K, Secrist JA 3rd, Weitman S | title = Discovery and development of clofarabine: a nucleoside analogue for treating cancer | journal = nat Rev Drug Discov | volume = 5 | issue = 10 | pages = 855-63 | date=Feb 2014 | pmid = 17016426 | doi = 10.1038/nrd2055 }}</ref>

Clofarabine can be administered intravenously or given orally. Clofarabine enters cells via hENT1, hENT2, and hCNT2, where upon it is phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase to generate clofarabine-5´-monophosphate. The rate-limiting step in clofarabine metabolism is clofarabine-5´-diphosphosphate. Clofarabine-5´-triphosphate is the active-metabolite, and it inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, resulting in a decrease cellular dNTP concentrations, which promotes greater incorporation of clofarabine-5´-triphosphate during DNA synthesis. Embedded clofarabine-5´-monophosphate in the DNA promotes polymerase arrest at the replication fork, triggering DNA repair mechanisms that without repair lead to DNA strand breaks in vitro and cytochrome c-mediated apoptosis in vitro. Studies using cell lines have shown that clofarabine-5´-triphosphate can also be incorporated into RNA.<ref name=" Shelton 2016">{{cite journal |vauthors=Shelton J, Lu X, Hollenbaugh JA, Cho JH, Amblard F, Schinazi RF | title = Metabolism, Biochemical Actions, and Chemical Synthesis of Anticancer Nucleosides, Nucleotides, and Base Analogs | journal = Chem Rev | volume = 116 | issue = 23 | pages = 14379-14455 |date=Dec 2016 | pmid = 27960273 | doi = 10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00209 }}</ref>
