'''Raloxifene''' (marketed as '''Evista''' by [[Eli Lilly and Company]]) is an oral [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]] (SERM) that has estrogenic actions on bone and anti-estrogenic actions on the uterus and breast.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Muchmore DB | title = Raloxifene: A selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) with multiple target system effects. | journal = The oncologist | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = 388–392 | year = 2000 | url = http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/content/5/5/388.long | pmid = 11040275| doi = 10.1634/theoncologist.5-5-388}}</ref> It is used in the prevention of [[osteoporosis]] in postmenopausal women and to reduce the risk of invasive [[breast cancer]] in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and in postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer.<ref>{{cite press release |title=FDA Approves New Uses for Evista 
| publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |date=2007-09-14 |url=http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2007/NEW01698.html |accessdate=2007-09-15}}</ref>

==Medical use==
Raloxifene is indicated for the treatment and prevention of [[osteoporosis]] in [[menopause|postmenopausal]] women. It is also used for reduction of risk and treatment of invasive breast cancer, and it also reduces breast density.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Reduction of Breast Density Following Tamoxifen Treatment Evaluated by 3-D MRI: Preliminary Study | journal=Magn Reson Imaging | date=September 15, 2003 | author=Jeon-Hor, Chen| doi=10.1016/j.mri.2010.07.009|display-authors=etal | pmc=3005955 | pmid=20832226 | volume=29 | pages=91–8}}</ref>
For either osteoporosis treatment or prevention, supplemental [[calcium]] and/or [[vitamin D]] should be added to the diet if daily intake is inadequate.

==Adverse reactions==
Common adverse events considered to be drug-related were [[hot flush|hot flash]]es and leg [[cramp]]s.<ref name=Label>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2007/022042lbl.pdf Raloxifene label] Last updated 09/2007]</ref>

Raloxifene may infrequently cause serious [[thrombus|blood clot]]s to form in the legs, lungs, or eyes. Other reactions experienced include leg swelling/pain, trouble breathing, chest pain, vision changes. Raloxifene is a [[Teratology|teratogenic]] drug, i.e., can cause developmental abnormalities such as birth defects.

Black box warnings were added to the label of raloxifene in 2007 warning of increased risk of death due to stroke for postmenopausal women with documented coronary heart disease or at increased risk for major coronary events, as well as increased risks for [[deep vein thrombosis]] and [[pulmonary embolism]].<ref name=Label/>

A report in September 2009 from Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality suggests that tamoxifen and raloxifene, used to treat breast cancer, significantly reduce invasive breast cancer in midlife and older women, but also increase the risk of adverse side effects.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://archive.ahrq.gov/news/newsroom/press-releases/2009/brcanmed.html | title=Medications Effective in Reducing Risk of Breast Cancer But Increase Risk of Adverse Effects | author=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Rockville, MD.| accessdate=2009-09-14|date=September 2009}}</ref>

A recent human case report in July 2016 suggests that raloxifene may in fact, at some point, also stimulate breast cancer growth leading to a reduction of advanced breast cancer disease upon the withdrawal of the drug.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1534735416658954 |title=Anti-Estrogen Withdrawal Effect With Raloxifene? A Case Report|journal=Integrative Cancer Therapies |volume=Published Online Before Print July 13|year=2016 |last1=Lemmo |first1=W |pages=245–249}}</ref>

==Contraindications and precautions==
Raloxifene is contraindicated in lactating women or women who are or may become [[pregnant]], in women with active or past history of venous [[Thrombosis|thromboembolic event]]s, including [[deep vein thrombosis]], [[pulmonary embolism]], and retinal vein thrombosis and in women known to be hypersensitive to raloxifene.<ref name=Label/>

==Pharmacology==
The biological actions of raloxifene are largely mediated through binding to estrogen receptors. This binding results in activation of estrogenic pathways in some tissues (agonism) and blockade of estrogenic pathways in others (antagonism). Its agonistic activity at some receptors and its antagonistic activity at others makes it a SERM. Raloxifene appears to act as an estrogen agonist in bone.<ref name="Label"/>

==Physical and chemical properties ==
Raloxifene [[hydrochloride]] (HCl) has the empirical formula C<sub>28</sub>H<sub>27</sub>NO<sub>4</sub>S•HCl, which corresponds to a molecular weight of 510.05 g/mol. Raloxifene HCl is an off-white to pale-yellow solid that is slightly soluble in water.<ref name=Label/>

==Society and culture==
An editorial in Lancet Oncology criticized the way that information about the drug was released.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Thelancetoncology,| title = A STARring role for raloxifene? | journal = Lancet Oncol | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | pages = 443 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16750489| doi = 10.1016/S1470-2045(06)70701-X}}</ref>
