'''Trifluoperazine''', sold under a number of brand names, is a [[typical antipsychotic]] primarily used to treat [[schizophrenia]].<ref name=AHFS2017>{{cite web|title=Trifluoperazine Hydrochloride|url=https://www.drugs.com/monograph/trifluoperazine-hydrochloride.html|publisher=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate= 8 January 2017}}</ref> It may also be used short term in those with [[generalized anxiety disorder]] but is less preferred to [[benzodiazepines]].<ref name=AHFS2017/> It is of the [[phenothiazine]] [[chemical class]].

== Medical uses ==
===Schizophrenia===
Trifluoperazine is an effective [[antipsychotic]] for people with schizophrenia.<ref name=Koc2014/> There is low quality evidence that trifluoperazine increases the chance of being improved when compared to placebo when people are followed up for 19 weeks.<ref name=Koc2014/> There is low quality evidence that trifluoperazine reduces the risk of relapse when compared with placebo when people are followed for 5 months.<ref name=Koc2014/> As of 2014 there was no good evidence for a difference between trifluoperazine and [[placebo]] with respect to the risk of experiencing intensified symptoms over a 16-week period nor in reducing significant agitation or distress.<ref name=Koc2014>{{cite journal|last1=Koch| first1=K| last2=Mansi|first2=K| first3=E| last3=Haynes|title=Trifluoperazine versus placebo for schizophrenia|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=2014|volume=1|url=http://www.cochrane.org/CD010226/SCHIZ_trifluoperazine-versus-placebo-for-schizophrenia|pages=CD010226.pub2 |DOI=10.1002/14651858.CD010226.pub2|pmid= 24414883|layurl=https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Trifluoperazine_versus_placebo_for_schizophrenia#References |laydate=20 July 2017 }}</ref>

There is no good evidence that trifluoperazine is more effective for schizophrenia than lower-potency antipsychotics like [[chlorpromazine]], [[chlorprothixene]], [[thioridazine]] and [[levomepromazine]], but trifluoperazine appears to cause more adverse effects than these drugs.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tardy|first1=M|last2=Dold|first2=M|last3=Engel|first3=RR|last4=Leucht|first4=S|title=Trifluoperazine versus low-potency first-generation antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=8 July 2014|issue=7|pages=CD009396|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009396.pub2|pmid=25003310}}</ref>

===Other===
It appears to be effective for people with [[generalized anxiety disorder]] but the benefit-risk ratio was unclear as of 2005.<ref>{{cite journal| author = David S.

== Side effects ==
Its use in  many parts of the world has declined because of highly frequent and severe early and late [[tardive dyskinesia]], a type of  [[extrapyramidal symptom]].  The annual development rate of tardive dyskinesia may be as high as 4%.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Contraindications ==
Trifluoperazine is contraindicated in [[CNS depression]], [[coma]], and [[blood dyscrasia]]s. Trifluoperazine should be used with caution in patients suffering from renal or hepatic impairment.

== Names ==
Brand names include Eskazinyl, Eskazine, Jatroneural, Modalina, Stelazine, Terfluzine, Trifluoperaz, Triftazin.

In the [[United Kingdom]] and some other countries, trifluoperazine is sold and marketed under the brand 'Stelazine'.

The drug is sold as tablet, liquid and 'Trifluoperazine-injectable USP' for deep [[intramuscular]] short-term use.

In the past, trifluoperazine was used in fixed combinations with the [[MAO inhibitor]] (antidepressant) [[tranylcypromine]] ([[tranylcypromine/trifluoperazine]]) to attenuate the strong stimulating effects of this antidepressant. This combination was sold under the brand name Jatrosom N. Likewise a combination with [[amobarbital]] (potent sedative/hypnotic agent) for the amelioration of [[psychoneurosis]] and [[insomnia]] existed under the brand name Jalonac. In [[Italy]] the first combination is still available, sold under the brand name Parmodalin (10&nbsp;mg of tranylcypromine and 1&nbsp;mg of trifluoperazine).
