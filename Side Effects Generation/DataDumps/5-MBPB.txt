'''5-MBPB''' (also known as '''5-MPBP''' and '''5-MABB''') is an [[entactogenic]] [[Substituted amphetamine|amphetamine]] derivative which is structurally related to [[MDMA]] and has been sold as a [[designer drug]]. It can be described as the [[benzofuran]]-5-yl [[Structural analog|analogue]] of [[MBDB]] or the butanamine [[Homology (chemistry)|homologue]] of [[5-MAPB]], and is also a [[structural isomer]] of [[5-EAPB]] and [[6-EAPB]]. Anecdotal reports suggest this compound has been sold as a designer drug in various European countries since early 2015, but the first definitive identification was made in December 2015 by a forensic laboratory in [[Slovenia]].<ref>[http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/system/files/publications/2880/TDAS16001ENN.pdf European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction â€“ Europol 2015 Annual Report on the implementation of Council Decision 2005/387/JHA]</ref>

5-MBPB is similar in structure to compounds such as [[5-APB]] which are claimed to be agonists of the [[5-HT2C|5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor]].<ref>{{cite patent
