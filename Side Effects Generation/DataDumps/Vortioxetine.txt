'''Vortioxetine'''{{#tag:ref|Also known by the brand names '''Brintellix''' and '''Trintellix'''. During early development it was known as '''Lu AA21004'''. | group = note}} is an [[antidepressant]] medication that is prescribed to treat [[Clinical depression|depression]]. It is believed to work to relieve depression by increasing [[serotonin]] concentrations in the brain, by inhibiting its [[reuptake]] in the [[synapse]] and by modulating (activating certain receptors while blocking, or antagonizing, others) certain [[serotonin receptors]]. This puts it in the class of antidepressants known as [[serotonin modulators and stimulators]]. It is made by the pharmaceutical companies [[Lundbeck]] and [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company|Takeda]].<ref name=Label>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/204447s004lbl.pdf US Label] Last updated July 2014 after review in September, 2014.

==Adverse effects==
The most common [[side effect]]s reported with vortioxetine are [[nausea]], [[diarrhea]], [[dry mouth]], [[constipation]], [[vomiting]], [[flatulence]], [[dizziness]], and [[sexual dysfunction]].<ref name=Label/> Vortioxetine used alone in high dose or in combination with other medications, such as other antidepressants, can produce a potentially life-threatening drug reaction known as [[serotonin syndrome]].<ref name=Label/>

Incidence of sexual dysfunction is reportedly higher in patients taking vortioxetine than in people taking [[placebo]]s but appears to be lower than in people taking most other antidepressants.<ref name=Label/><ref name=KellinyRev2015/>

===Pharmacokinetics===
Vortioxetine reaches peak [[blood plasma|plasma]] concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) within 7 to 11 hours post-administration (T<sub>max</sub>), and its mean terminal [[half-life]] ({{frac|T|1/2}}) is ≈ 66 hours. Steady-state plasma concentrations are typically reached within two weeks.<ref name=Label/> It has no [[active metabolite]]s (i.e., it is not a [[prodrug]]).<ref name=Label/>

==History==
[[File:Trintellix 10mg tablets.png|thumb|10mg tablets of brand-name vortioxetine (Trintellix, formerly known as Brintellix).]]

Vortioxetine was discovered by scientists at [[Lundbeck]] who reported the rationale and synthesis for the drug (then called Lu AA21004) in a 2011 paper.<ref name="pmid21486038"/><ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163725814001272 | pmid = 25016186 | doi=10.1016/j.pharmthera.2014.07.001 | volume=145 | title=Vortioxetine, a novel antidepressant with multimodal activity: review of preclinical and clinical data | year=2015 | journal=Pharmacol. Ther. | pages=43–57 | last1 = Sanchez | first1 = C | last2 = Asin | first2 = KE | last3 = Artigas | first3 = F}}</ref>

In 2007, the compound was in Phase II clinical trials, and Lundbeck and [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company|Takeda]] entered into a partnership in which Takeda paid Lundbeck $40 million upfront, with promises of up to $345 million in milestone payments, and Takeda agreed to pay most of the remaining cost of developing the drug.  The companies agreed to co-promote the drug in the US and Japan, and that Lundbeck would receive a royalty on all such sales.  The deal included another drug candidate, [[tedatioxetine]] (Lu AA24530), and could be expanded to include two other Lundbeck compounds.<ref>Daniel Beaulieu for First Word Pharma. September 5th, 2007 [http://www.firstwordpharma.com/node/88051?tsid=17#axzz3xkIEA5eH  Lundbeck, Takeda enter strategic alliance for mood disorder, anxiety drugs]</ref>

Vortioxetine was approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] for the treatment of [[major depressive disorder]] (MDD) in adults in September 2013,<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm370416.htm FDA approves new drug to treat major depressive disorder], U.S. Food and Drug Administration Press Announcement.</ref> and it was approved in Europe later that year.<ref>EMA [http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/002717/human_med_001714.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d124 Brintellix page at EMA site]  Page accessed January 19, 2016</ref>

Vortioxetine was previously trademarked as ''Brintellix'' in the United States, but on May 2, 2016, the US FDA approved a name change to ''Trintellix'' in order to avoid confusion with the blood-thinning medication Brilinta ([[ticagrelor]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm498607.htm |title=Safety Alerts for Human Medical Products - Brintellix (vortioxetine): Drug Safety Communication - Brand Name Change to Trintellix, to Avoid Confusion With Antiplatelet Drug Brilinta (ticagrelor)|last=Commissioner|first=Office of the|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-05-02}}</ref>

==Research==
Vortioxetine has been studied in several clinical trials as a potential treatment for [[generalized anxiety disorder]] but results were inconsistent.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pae | first1 = CU | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | date = May 2015 | title = Vortioxetine, a multimodal antidepressant for generalized anxiety disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis | url = | journal = J Psychiatr Res | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 88–98 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2015.02.017 | pmid = 25851751 }}</ref><ref>Reinhold JA, Rickels K.
