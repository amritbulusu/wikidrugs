'''Levosalbutamol''', also known as '''levalbuterol''', is a short-acting [[Beta2-adrenergic agonist|β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptor agonist]] used in the treatment of [[asthma]] and [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD). Evidence does not show that levosalbutamol works better than [[salbutamol]], thus there may not be sufficient justification for prescribing it.<ref name="Jat2013">{{cite journal |last1=Jat|first1=K. R. |last2=Khairwa |first2=A. |title=Levalbuterol versus albuterol for acute asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Pulmonary Pharmacology & Therapeutics |date=April 2013 |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=239–248 |pmid=23207739 |doi=10.1016/j.pupt.2012.11.003}}</ref>

The drug is the (''R'')-(−)-[[enantiomer]] of its prototype drug [[salbutamol]]. It is available in some countries in generic formulations from pharmaceutical companies including Cipla, Teva, and Dey, among others.

== Medical use ==
Levosalbutamol's [[bronchodilator]] properties give it indications in treatment of COPD ([[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], also known as chronic obstructive lung disease) and [[asthma]]. Like other bronchodilators, it acts by relaxing smooth muscle in the [[bronchial tubes]], and thus shortening or reversing an [[Acute (medicine)|acute]] "attack" of shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Unlike some slower-acting bronchodilators, it is not indicated as a preventative of [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] bronchial constriction.

=== Comparison to salbutamol ===
A 2013 [[systematic review]] of the drug's use as a treatment for acute asthma found that it "was not superior to albuterol regarding efficacy and safety in subjects with acute asthma." The review concluded: "We suggest that levalbuterol should not be used over albuterol for acute asthma."<ref name="Jat2013" /> Levalbuterol is notably more costly.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Schreck DM, Babin S |title=Comparison of racemic albuterol and levalbuterol in the treatment of acute asthma in the ED |journal=Am J Emerg Med |volume=23 |issue=7 |pages=842–7 |date=November 2005 |pmid=16291438 |doi=10.1016/j.ajem.2005.04.003}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hendeles L, Hartzema A |title=Levalbuterol is not more cost-effective than albuterol for COPD |journal=Chest |volume=124 |issue=3 |pages=1176; author reply 1176–8 |date=September 2003 |pmid=12970057 |doi=10.1378/chest.124.3.1176}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Generally, levosalbutamol is well tolerated. Common mild side-effects include an elevated heart rate, muscle cramps, and gastric upset (including heartburn and diarrhea).<ref name="MedlinePlus">{{cite web |title=Levalbuterol Oral Inhalation |author=American Society of Health-System Pharmacists |work=[[MedlinePlus]] |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health |location=Bethesda, Maryland |date=1 September 2010 |url= http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a603025.html |access-date=7 January 2015}}</ref>

Symptoms of overdose in particular include: collapse into a [[Non-epileptic seizure|seizure]]; chest pain (possible precursor of a [[heart attack]]); fast, pounding heartbeat, which may cause raised blood pressure ([[hypertension]]); irregular heartbeat ([[cardiac arrhythmia]]), which may cause paradoxical lowered blood pressure ([[hypotension]]); nervousness and [[tremor]]; headache; dizziness and [[nausea]]/vomiting; weakness or exhaustion ([[Fatigue (medical)|medical fatigue]]); dry mouth; and [[insomnia]].<ref name="MedlinePlus" />

Rarer side effects may indicate a dangerous allergic reaction. These include: paradoxical [[bronchospasm]] (shortness of breath and difficulty breathing); skin itching, rash, or hives ([[urticaria]]); swelling ([[angioedema]]) of any part of the face or throat (which can lead to [[Dysphonia|voice hoarseness]]), or swelling of the extremities.<ref name="MedlinePlus" />

== Pharmacology ==
Levosalbutamol has similar [[Pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]] and [[Pharmacodynamics|pharmacodynamic]] properties to [[salbutamol]].<ref>Xenopex [package insert]  Marlborough, MA: Sunovion Pharmaceuticals. 2014</ref>{{clarify|date=January 2016|reason=List them here; people should not have to compare the two articles side by side!}}

=== Mechanism of action ===
Activation of β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] on airway smooth muscle leads to the activation of [[adenylate cyclase]] and to an increase in the intracellular concentration of [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate]] (cyclic AMP). The increase in cyclic AMP is associated with the activation of protein [[kinase]] A, which in turn, inhibits the [[phosphorylation]] of [[myosin]] and lowers intracellular ionic calcium concentrations, resulting in muscle relaxation.

Levosalbutamol relaxes the smooth muscles of all airways, from the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] to the terminal bronchioles. Increased cyclic AMP concentrations are also associated with the inhibition of the release of mediators from mast cells in the airways. Levosalbutamol acts as a functional [[agonist]] that relaxes the airway irrespective of the spasmogen involved, thereby protecting against all [[bronchoconstrictor]] challenges.

While it is recognized that β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptors are the predominant receptors on bronchial smooth muscle, data indicate that there are beta receptors in the human heart, 10–50% of which are β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established. However, all β adrenergic agonist drugs can produce a significant [[cardiovascular]] effect in some patients, as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, and restlessness symptoms, and/or [[electrocardiographic]] (ECG) changes.

== Approval and names ==
Levosalbutamol is the [[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]] while levalbuterol is the [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]].

Levalbuterol was originally available only as a solution for [[nebulizer]] and eventually become available as a [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]]-free [[metered-dose inhaler]] under the trade name Xopenex HFA (levalbuterol [[tartrate]] inhalation aerosol). The [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approval date was on March 11, 2005.<ref>[http://www.xopenex.com/aboutXopenex/inhaler/xopenex-mdi-FAQs.html (See Official FAQ)]</ref>

It is also available in India as a combination drug Duolin (levosalbutamol/[[ipratropium bromide]]).<ref>[http://beta.ciplamed.com/content/duolin-inhaler-with-dose-counter]</ref>
