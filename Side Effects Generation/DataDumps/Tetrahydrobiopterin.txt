== Adverse effects ==
The most common [[adverse effects]], observed in more than 10% of patients, include headache and a running or obstructed nose. Diarrhea and vomiting are also relatively common, seen in at least 1% of patients.<ref name="AustriaCodex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|date=1 March 2017|language=German|at=Kuvan 100 mg-Tabletten}}</ref>

== Interactions ==
No interaction studies have been conducted. Because of its mechanism, tetrahydrobiopterin might interact with [[dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor]]s like [[methotrexate]] and [[trimethoprim]], and NO-enhancing drugs like [[nitroglycerin]], [[molsidomine]], [[minoxidil]], and [[PDE5 inhibitors]]. Combination of tetrahydrobiopterin with [[levodopa]] can lead to increased excitability.<ref name="AustriaCodex" />

== Functions ==
Tetrahydrobiopterin has the following responsibilities as a cofactor:
* [[Tryptophan hydroxylase]] (TPH) for the conversion of [[L-tryptophan]] (TRP) to [[5-hydroxytryptophan]] (5-HTP)
* [[Phenylalanine hydroxylase]] (PAH) for conversion of [[L-phenylalanine]] (PHE) to [[L-tyrosine]] (TYR)
* [[Tyrosine hydroxylase]] (TH) for the conversion of L-tyrosine to [[L-DOPA]] (DOPA)
* [[Nitric oxide synthase]] (NOS) for conversion of a guanidino nitrogen of [[L-arginine]] (L-Arg) to [[nitric oxide]] (NO)
* [[Alkylglycerol monooxygenase]] (AGMO) for the conversion of [[1-alkyl-sn-glycerol]] to [[1-hydroxyalkyl-sn-glycerol]]

Tetrahydrobiopterin has multiple roles in human biochemistry. One is to convert amino acids such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan to precursors of dopamine and serotonin, major [[monoamine]] neurotransmitters. Due to its role in the conversion of [[L-tyrosine]] into [[L-dopa]], which is the precursor for [[dopamine]], a deficiency in tetrahydrobiopterin can cause severe neurological issues unrelated to a toxic buildup of L-phenylalanine; [[dopamine]] is a vital [[neurotransmitter]], and is the precursor of [[norepinephrine]] and [[epinephrine]]. Thus, a deficiency of BH4 can lead to systemic deficiencies of dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. In fact, one of the primary conditions that can result from GTPCH-related BH4 deficiency is [[dopamine-responsive dystonia]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/GCH1|title=Genetics Home Reference: GCH1|publisher=[[National Institutes of Health]] }}</ref> currently, this condition is typically treated with [[carbidopa/levodopa]], which directly restores dopamine levels within the brain.

BH4 also serves as a catalyst for the production of [[nitric oxide]]. Among other things, nitric oxide is involved in [[vasodilation]], which improves systematic blood flow. The role of BH4 in this enzymatic process is so critical that some research points to a deficiency of BH4 – and thus, of nitric oxide – as being a core cause of the neurovascular dysfunction that is the hallmark of circulation-related diseases such as [[diabetes]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/biof.3 |pmid=19319842 |title=Nitric oxide and vascular insulin resistance |journal=BioFactors |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=21–7 |year=2009 |last1=Wu |first1=Guoyao |last2=Meininger |first2=Cynthia J. }}</ref>

== History ==
Tetrahydrobiopterin was discovered to play a role as an enzymatic cofactor. The first enzyme found to use tetrahydrobiopterin is [[phenylalanine hydroxylase]] (PAH).<ref>{{Cite journal |pmid=13525410 |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=13525410 |year=1958 |author1=Kaufman |first1=S |title=A new cofactor required for the enzymatic conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine |journal=The Journal of biological chemistry |volume=230 |issue=2 |pages=931–9 }}</ref>

== Biosynthesis and recycling ==
Tetrahydrobiopterin is biosynthesized from [[guanosine triphosphate]] (GTP) by three chemical reactions mediated by the enzymes [[GTP cyclohydrolase I]] (GTPCH), [[6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase]] (PTPS), and [[sepiapterin reductase]] (SR).<ref name="pmid10727395">{{cite journal |doi=10.1042/0264-6021:3470001 |pmid=10727395 |pmc=1220924 |title=Tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis, regeneration and functions |journal=Biochemical Journal |volume=347 |pages=1–16 |year=2000 |last1=Thöny |first1=Beat |last2=Auerbach |first2=Günter |last3=Blau |first3=Nenad }}</ref>

BH4 is catabolized to BH3 and BH2, which are pro-oxidants ([[free radicals]]). Research shows that ascorbic acid (also known as ascorbate or [[vitamin C]]) is effective at recycling BH3 into BH4,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1074/jbc.M302227200 |pmid=12692136 |title=Interactions of Peroxynitrite, Tetrahydrobiopterin, Ascorbic Acid, and Thiols: IMPLICATIONS FOR UNCOUPLING ENDOTHELIAL NITRIC-OXIDE SYNTHASE |journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=278 |issue=25 |pages=22546–54 |year=2003 |last1=Kuzkaya |first1=N. |last2=Weissmann |first2=N. |last3=Harrison |first3=D. G. |last4=Dikalov |first4=S. }}</ref> preventing the BH3 radical from reacting with other free radicals ([[superoxide]]  and [[peroxynitrite]] specifically). Without this recycling process, uncoupling of the endothelial [[nitric oxide synthase]] (eNOS) enzyme and reduced bioavailability of the [[vasodilator]] [[nitric oxide]] occur, creating a form of [[endothelial dysfunction]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Ascorbic acid and tetrahydrobiopterin: looking beyond nitric oxide bioavailability|journal=Cardiovascular Research|volume=84|issue=2|pages=178–9|doi=10.1093/cvr/cvp307|pmid=19744948|year=2009|last1=Muller-Delp|first1=J. M.}}</ref> Ascorbic acid is oxidized to [[dehydroascorbic acid]] during this process, although it can be recycled back to ascorbic acid.

== Research ==
Other than PKU studies, tetrahydrobiopterin has participated in clinical trials studying other approaches to solving conditions resultant from a deficiency of tetrahydrobiopterin.  These include [[autism]], [[ADHD]], [[hypertension]], [[endothelial dysfunction]], and [[chronic kidney disease]].<ref>[http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=kuvan&pg=2 ClinicalTrials.gov: Search results for Kuvan]</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/press-releases/biomarin-initiates-phase-3b-study-evaluate-effects-kuvan-neurophychiatric-symptoms-su|title=BioMarin Initiates Phase 3b Study to Evaluate the Effects of Kuvan on Neurophychiatric Symptoms in Subjects with PKU|date=17 August 2010|publisher=BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc}}</ref> Experimental studies suggest that tetrahydrobiopterin regulates deficient production of nitric oxide in cardiovascular disease states, and contributes to the response to inflammation and injury, for example in pain due to nerve injury. A 2015 BioMarin-funded study of PKU patients found that those who responded to tetrahydrobiopterin also showed a reduction of ADHD symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ymgme.2014.11.011 |pmid=25533024 |title=A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of sapropterin to treat ADHD symptoms and executive function impairment in children and adults with sapropterin-responsive phenylketonuria |journal=Molecular Genetics and Metabolism |volume=114 |issue=3 |pages=415–24 |year=2015 |last1=Burton |first1=B. |last2=Grant |first2=M. |last3=Feigenbaum |first3=A. |last4=Singh |first4=R. |last5=Hendren |first5=R. |last6=Siriwardena |first6=K. |last7=Phillips |first7=J. |last8=Sanchez-Valle |first8=A. |last9=Waisbren |first9=S. |last10=Gillis |first10=J. |last11=Prasad |first11=S. |last12=Merilainen |first12=M. |last13=Lang |first13=W. |last14=Zhang |first14=C. |last15=Yu |first15=S. |last16=Stahl |first16=S. }}</ref>

=== Autism ===
In 1997, a small pilot study was published on the efficacy of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) on relieving the symptoms of autism, which concluded that it "might be useful for a subgroup of children with autism" and that double-blind trials are needed, as are trials which measure outcomes over a longer period of time.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8749.1997.tb07437.x |pmid=9236697 |title=Possible effects of tetrahydrobiopterin treatment in six children with autism - clinical and positron emission tomography data: A pilot study |journal=Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=313–8 |year=2008 |last1=Fernell |first1=Elisabeth |last2=Watanabe |first2=Yasuyoshi |last3=Adolfsson |first3=Ingrid |last4=Tani |first4=Yoshihiro |last5=Bergström |first5=Mats |last6=Phd |first6=Per Hartvig |last7=Md |first7=Anders Lilja |last8=Phd. |first8=Anne-Liis von Knorring MD. |last9=Phd. |first9=Christopher Gillberg MD. |last10=Phd. |first10=Bengt Lángström }}</ref> In 2010, [[Richard E.
