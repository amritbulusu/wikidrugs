'''Hydromorphone''', also known as '''dihydromorphinone''', and sold under the brand name '''Dilaudid''', among others, is a centrally acting [[analgesic|pain medication]] of the [[opioid]] class.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.drugs.com/pro/hydromorphone.html |title = Hydromorphone – FDA prescribing information, side effects and uses |author =  |date =  |website = drugs.com |accessdate = 2 September 2017 }}</ref> It is made from [[morphine]]. Comparatively, hydromorphone is to morphine as [[hydrocodone]] is to [[codeine]] – it is a hydrogenated ketone thereof. In medical terms, it is an opioid analgesic, and in legal terms, a [[narcotic]]. Hydromorphone is commonly used in the hospital setting, mostly intravenously (IV) because its bioavailability is very low orally, rectally, and intranasally. [[Sublingual administration]] (under the tongue) is usually superior to swallowing for bioavailability and effects; however, hydromorphone is bitter and [[hydrophilic]] like most opiates, not [[lipophilic]], so it is absorbed poorly and slowly through mouth membranes.

Hydromorphone is much more soluble in water than morphine and, therefore, hydromorphone solutions can be produced to deliver the drug in a smaller volume of water. The hydrochloride salt is soluble in three parts of water, whereas a gram of morphine hydrochloride dissolves in 16&nbsp;ml of water; for all common purposes, the pure powder for hospital use can be used to produce solutions of virtually arbitrary concentration. When the powder has appeared on the street, this very small volume of powder needed for a dose means that overdoses are likely for those who mistake it for [[heroin]] or other powdered narcotics, especially those that have been [[Cutting agent|cut]] (diluted) prior to consumption.<ref>''Hydromorphone Hydrochloride''; MSDS No. 71681; Purdue Pharma L.P.: Stamford, CT, 13 October 2009. [http://www.purduepharma.com/msdss/Dilaudid_2_4_8mgTablets_OralLiquid_MSDS.pdf http://www.purduepharma.com/msdss/Dilaudid_2_4_8mgTablets_OralLiquid_MSDS.pdf (accessed November 5, 2015)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150117082035/http://www.purduepharma.com/msdss/Dilaudid_2_4_8mgTablets_OralLiquid_MSDS.pdf |date=17 January 2015 }}</ref>

Very small quantities of hydromorphone are detected in assays of [[opium]] on rare occasions; it appears to be produced by the plant under circumstances and by processes which are not understood at this time and may include the action of bacteria. A similar process or other metabolic processes in the plant may very well be responsible for the very low quantities of hydrocodone also found on rare occasions in opium and alkaloid mixtures derived from opium. [[Dihydrocodeine]], [[oxymorphol]], [[oxycodone]], [[oxymorphone]], [[metopon]], and possibly other derivatives of morphine and hydromorphone also are found in trace amounts in opium.
{{TOC limit|3}}

== Side effects ==

Adverse effects of hydromorphone are similar to those of other potent opioid analgesics, such as [[morphine]] and [[heroin]]. The major hazards of hydromorphone include dose-related [[respiratory depression]], urinary retention, bronchospasm and sometimes circulatory depression.<ref name="rxlist.com">[http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/hydromorphone_ad.htm Hydromorphone Monograph] (Side Effects & Drug Interactions)</ref> More common [[adverse effect|side effects]] include [[lightheadedness]], [[dizziness]], [[sedation]], [[itch]]ing, [[constipation]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[headache]], [[perspiration]], and [[hallucination]]s.<ref name="rxlist.com" /> These symptoms are common in ambulatory patients and in those not experiencing severe pain.

Simultaneous use of hydromorphone with other opioids, muscle relaxants, tranquilizers, sedatives, and general anesthetics can cause a significant increase in respiratory depression, progressing to coma or death. Taking [[benzodiazepine]]s (such as [[diazepam]]) in conjunction with hydromorphone may increase side effects such as dizziness and difficulty concentrating.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.drugs.com/drug-interactions/dilaudid-with-valium-1294-768-862-441.html |title = Drug interactions between Dilaudid and Valium |accessdate = 19 November 2014 }}</ref> If simultaneous use of these drugs is required, dose adjustment can be done.<ref name="app.purduepharma.com">{{Cite web |title = Dilaudid (hydromorphone hydrochloride) Oral LiquidDilaudid (hydromorphone hydrochloride) Tablets |url = http://app.purduepharma.com/xmlpublishing/pi.aspx?id=dt |website = app.purduepharma.com |accessdate = 5 November 2015 }}</ref>

A particular problem that may occur with hydromorphone is accidental administration in place of morphine due to a mix-up between the similar names, either at the time the prescription is written or when the drug is dispensed. This has led to several deaths and calls for hydromorphone to be distributed in distinctly different packaging from morphine to avoid confusion.<ref name="pmid1377371">{{cite journal |last = Cohen |first = MR |title = Doctor was thinking of the wrong drug |journal = Nursing |volume = 22 |issue = 6 |page = 25 |date = June 1992 |pmid = 1377371 }}</ref><ref name="pmid16308048">{{cite journal |last1 = Tuohy |first1 = N |last2 = Paparella |first2 = S |title = Look-alike and sound-alike drugs: errors just waiting to happen |journal = J Emerg Nurs |volume = 31 |issue = 6 |pages = 569–71 |date = December 2005 |pmid = 16308048 |doi = 10.1016/j.jen.2005.07.012 }}</ref>

Massive overdoses are rarely observed in opioid-tolerant individuals, but when they occur, they may lead to circulatory system collapse. Symptoms of overdose include respiratory depression, drowsiness leading to coma and sometimes to death, drooping of skeletal muscles, low heart rate and decreasing blood pressure. At the hospital, individuals with hydromorphone overdose are provided supportive care such as assisted ventilation to provide oxygen, gut decontamination using activated charcoal through a nasogastric tube. Opioid antagonist such as naloxone can also be administered concurrent with oxygen supplementation. Naloxone works by reversing the effects of hydromorphone. It is only administered in the presence of significant respiratory depression and circulatory depression.<ref name="app.purduepharma.com" />

The effects of overdose can be exacerbated by [[dose dumping]] if the medication is taken with [[Ethanol|alcohol]].<ref>[http://www.webmd.com/pain-management/news/20050714/palladone-pain-drug-pulled-off-market Palladone Pain Drug Pulled Off the Market].</ref>

Sugar cravings associated with hydromorphone use are the result of a glucose crash after transient hyperglycemia following injection or a less profound lowering of blood sugar over a period of hours, in common with morphine, heroin, codeine, and other opiates.

=== Hormone imbalance ===
{{Main|Opioid#Hormone imbalance}}

As with other opioids, hydromorphone (particularly during heavy chronic use) often causes temporary [[hypogonadism]] or [[hormone imbalance]].<ref name="pmid23414717">{{cite journal |last = Brennan |first = MJ |title = The effect of opioid therapy on endocrine function |journal = The American Journal of Medicine |volume = 126 |issue = 3 Suppl 1 |pages = S12–8 |year = 2013 |pmid = 23414717 |doi = 10.1016/j.amjmed.2012.12.001 }}</ref>

=== Neurotoxicity ===

In the setting of prolonged use, high dosage, and/or kidney dysfunction, hydromorphone has been associated with neuroexcitatory symptoms such as [[tremor]], [[myoclonus]], [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]], and [[cognitive dysfunction]].<ref name="Thwaites 545–50" /><ref name="pmid23715067">{{cite journal |last1 = Gagnon |first1 = DJ |last2 = Jwo |first2 = K |title = Tremors and agitation following low-dose intravenous hydromorphone administration in a patient with kidney dysfunction |journal = Annals of Pharmacotherapy |volume = 47 |issue = 7-8 |pages = e34 |year = 2013 |pmid = 23715067 |doi = 10.1345/aph.1R784 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Rapp |first1 = SE |last2 = Egan |first2 = KJ |last3 = Ross |first3 = BK |last4 = Wild |first4 = LM |last5 = Terman |first5 = GW |last6 = Ching |first6 = JM |display-authors = 3 |title = A multidimensional comparison of morphine and hydromorphone patient-controlled analgesia. |journal = Anesth Analg. |volume = 82 |issue = 5 |pages = 1043–8 |date = May 1996 |pmid = 8610865 |doi = 10.1213/00000539-199605000-00029 }}</ref> This toxicity is less than that associated with other classes of opioids such as the [[pethidine]] class of synthetics in particular.

=== Withdrawal ===

Users of hydromorphone can experience painful symptoms if the drug is suspended.<ref name=":6" /> Some people can not tolerate the symptoms which result in continuous drug use<ref name=":6">{{Cite web |title = Hydromorphone / Dilaudid Detox |url = http://www.rapiddrugdetox.com/detox-facts-drugs/dilaudid-detox/ |website = Rapid Drug Detox |accessdate = 5 November 2015 |language = en-US }}</ref>

[[Methadone]] is an opioid commonly used for this kind of therapy. However,
the selection of therapy should be tailored to each specific person.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal |title = 4 Treatment Protocols |url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK64246/ |date = 1 January 2004 |first = Center for Substance Abuse |last = Treatment }}</ref> Methadone is also used for detoxification in people who have opioid addiction such as heroin or drugs similar to morphine.<ref name=":1" />
It can be given orally or intramuscularly. There is controversy
regarding the use of opioids for people experiencing withdrawal symptoms
since these agents can themselves cause relapse on patients when they
suspend therapy<ref name=":6" /> Clonidine
is a non-opioid adjunct that can be used in situations where opioid use is
not desired such as in patients with high blood pressure.<ref>{{Cite journal |url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2561435/pdf/jnma00224-0093.pdf |title = Simultaneous treatment of hypertension and opiate withdrawal using an alpha 2 adrenergic agonist |pmc = 2561435 |pmid = 6131140 |volume = 75 |year = 1983 |journal = J Natl Med Assoc |pages = 89–93 |author = Bell CC }}</ref>

== Interactions ==

CNS depressants may enhance the depressant effects of hydromorphone, such as other opioids, [[anesthetic]]s, [[sedative]]s, [[hypnotic]]s, [[barbiturate]]s, benzodiazepines, [[phenothiazine]]s, [[chloral hydrate]], [[dimenhydrinate]], and [[glutethimide]].  The depressant effect of hydromorphone may also be enhanced by [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAO inhibitors) (including [[procarbazine]]), first-generation [[antihistamine]]s ([[brompheniramine]], [[promethazine]], [[diphenhydramine]], [[chlorphenamine]]), [[beta blocker]]s, and [[alcohol]]. When combined therapy is contemplated, the dose should be reduced of one or both agents.<ref name="Thwaites 545–50">{{cite journal |last1 = Thwaites |first1 = D |last2 = McCann |first2 = S |last3 = Broderick |first3 = P |title = Hydromorphone neuroexcitation. |journal = Journal of palliative medicine |volume = 7 |issue = 4 |pages = 545–50 |date = Aug 2004 |pmid = 15353098 |doi = 10.1089/1096621041838362 }}</ref>

== Pharmacology ==

Hydromorphone is a semi-synthetic [[Opioid receptor#The μ-opioid receptor|μ-opioid]] [[agonist]]. As a hydrogenated ketone of morphine, it shares the pharmacologic properties typical of [[opioid analgesic]]s. Hydromorphone and related opioids produce their major effects on the [[central nervous system]] and [[gastrointestinal tract]]. These include [[analgesia]], drowsiness, mental clouding, changes in mood, [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]] or [[dysphoria]], respiratory depression, cough suppression, decreased gastrointestinal motility, nausea, vomiting, increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure, increased [[biliary tract|biliary pressure]], and increased pinpoint constriction of the pupils.<ref name=":3" />

=== Pharmacokinetics ===

The chemical modification of the morphine molecule to hydromorphone results in higher lipid solubility and greater ability to cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] to produce more rapid and complete central nervous system penetration. On a per milligram basis, hydromorphone is considered to be five times as potent as morphine; although the conversion ratio can vary from 4–8 times, five times is in typical clinical usage.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.alfredhealth.org.au/Assets/Files/OpioidConversionChart2007.pdf |title = Opioid Conversion Guidelines |author =  |date =  |website = alfredhealth.org.au |accessdate = 2 September 2017 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304121532/http://www.alfredhealth.org.au/Assets/Files/OpioidConversionChart2007.pdf |archivedate = 4 March 2016 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://nationalpaincentre.mcmaster.ca/documents/opioid_manager_switching_opioids.pdf |title = Switching Opioids |author =  |date =  |website = mcmaster.ca |accessdate = 2 September 2017 }}</ref> The development of tolerance also can vary in among individuals.

Patients with renal abnormalities must exercise caution when dosing hydromorphone. In those with renal impairment, the half-life of hydromorphone can increase to as much as 40 hours. The typical half-life of intravenous hydromorphone is 2.3 hours.<ref>{{cite web |title = Hydromorphone |work = That's Poppycock! |date = 19 February 2009 |url = http://www.thatspoppycock.com/opiates/hydromorphone/ }}</ref> Peak plasma levels usually occur between 30 and 60 minutes after oral dosing.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/hydromorphone_cp.htm |title = Dilaudid Clinical Pharmacology |author =  |date =  |website = rxlist.com |accessdate = 2 September 2017 }}</ref>

The onset of action for hydromorphone administered intravenously is less than 5 minutes and within 30 minutes of oral administration (immediate release).<ref name=":0" />

=== Metabolism ===

While other opioids in its class such as [[codeine]] or oxycodone are metabolized via CYP450 enzymes, hydromorphone is not.<ref>{{Cite journal |title = Hydromorphone: Evolving to Meet the Challenges of Today’s Health Care Environment |url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0149291813010229 |journal = Clinical Therapeutics |pages = 2007–2027 |volume = 35 |issue = 12 |doi = 10.1016/j.clinthera.2013.09.027 |first = Thomas B. |last = Gregory }}</ref> Hydromorphone is extensively metabolized in the liver to hydromorphone-3-glucoronide, which has no analgesic effects.  As similarly seen with the morphine metabolite, morphine-3-glucoronide, a build-up in levels of hydromorphone-3-glucoronide can produce excitatory neurotoxic effects such as restlessness, myoclonus and hyperalgesia.

Hydromorphone is made from morphine either by direct re-arrangement (made by reflux heating of alcoholic or acidic aqueous solution of morphine in the presence of platinum or palladium catalyst) or [[Redox|reduction]] to [[dihydromorphine]] (usually via catalytic [[hydrogenation]]), followed by [[oxidation]] with [[benzophenone]] in presence of [[t-butanol#Chemistry|potassium tert butoxide or aluminium tert butoxide]] ([[Oppenauer oxidation]]). The 6 ketone group can be replaced with a [[methylene group]] via the [[Wittig reaction]] to produce [[6-Methylenedihydrodesoxymorphine]], which is 80× stronger than morphine.<ref>[http://www.acsmedchem.org/module/opioid.html PHA 4220 – Neurology Pharmacotherapeutics<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716115228/http://www.acsmedchem.org/module/opioid.html |date=16 July 2007 }}</ref>

Changing morphine into hydromorphone increases its activity and, therefore, makes hydromorphone about eight times stronger than morphine on a weight basis, all other things being equal.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}} Changed also is lipid solubility, contributing to hydromorphone's having a more rapid onset of action and alterations to the overall absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination profile as well as the side effect profile (in general, less nausea and itching) versus that of morphine. The semi-synthetic opiates, of which hydromorphone and its codeine analogue [[hydrocodone]] are among the best-known and oldest, include a huge number of drugs of varying strengths and with differences among themselves both subtle and stark, allowing for many different options for treatment.

=== Endogenous production ===

Hydromorphone is made from morphine via catalytic hydrogenation and is also produced in trace amounts by human and other mammalian metabolism of morphine and occasionally appears in assays of opium latex in very small quantities, apparently forming in the plant in an unknown percentage of cases under poorly understood conditions.

==== Bacteria ====

Some bacteria have been shown to be able to turn morphine into closely related drugs including hydromorphone and dihydromorphine among others. The bacterium ''Pseudomonas putida'' serotype M10 produces a naturally occurring NADH-dependent morphinone reductase that can work on unsaturated 7,8 bonds, with result that, when these bacteria are living in an aqueous solution containing morphine, significant amounts of hydromorphone form, as it is an intermediary metabolite in this process; the same goes for codeine being turned into hydrocodone.<ref name="pmid7487001">{{cite journal |last1 = Long |first1 = MT |last2 = Hailes |first2 = AM |last3 = Kirby |first3 = GW |last4 = Bruce |first4 = NC |title = Transformations of morphine alkaloids by Pseudomonas putida M10 |journal = Appl. Environ. Microbiol. |volume = 61 |issue = 10 |pages = 3645–9 |date = October 1995 |pmid = 7487001 |pmc = 167664 |doi = }}</ref>

The process gave rise to various concentrations of hydromorphone, dihydromorphine, [[hydromorphinol]], and [[oxymorphone]] during the experiments. Three paths were found: from morphine to hydromorphone with dihydromorphine as the penultimate step, from morphine to hydromorphone with [[morphinone]] as the penultimate step, and from morphine to hydromorphinol to hydromorphone.

== History ==

Hydromorphone was first synthesized and researched in Germany by [[Abbott Laboratories|Knoll]] (first patent 1922)<ref> Preparation from morphine: German patent 365683; German patent 623821 (1922, 1936 both to Knoll); by oxidation of dihydromorphine.
O'Neil, M.J. (ed.). The Merck Index - An Encyclopedia of Chemicals, Drugs, and Biologicals. Cambridge, UK: Royal Society of Chemistry, 2013., p. 890 </ref> who introduced it to the mass market in 1926 under the brand name ''Dilaudid'',<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Felden |first1 = L |last2 = Walter |first2 = C |last3 = Harder |first3 = S |last4 = Treede |first4 = RD |last5 = Kayser |first5 = H |last6 = Drover |first6 = D |last7 = Geisslinger |first7 = G |last8 = Lötsch |first8 = J |display-authors = 3 |title = Comparative Clinical Effects of Hydromorphone and Morphine |journal = British Journal of Anaesthesia |volume = 107 |issue = 3 |pages = 319–328 |date = 22 September 2011 |pmid = 21841049 |doi = 10.1093/bja/aer232 |url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/748796 |accessdate = 10 March 2012 }}</ref> indicating its derivation and degree of similarity to morphine (by way of [[laudanum]])—compare Dicodid (hydrocodone), Dihydrin ([[dihydrocodeine]]), and Dinarkon ([[oxycodone]]). The brand name ''Dilaudid'' is more widely known than the generic term hydromorphone and, because of this, ''Dilaudid'' is often used generically to mean any form of hydromorphone.

== Society and culture ==

=== Recreational use ===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}

Like other opiates, hydromorphone can be used recreationally. Its reinforcing effects are mediated via its strong affinity for the μ-opioid receptor, inducing euphoria, sedation, [[anxiolytic|reduced anxiety]], respiratory depression, and other prototypical morphinian effects. Such effects make it particularly susceptible to abuse, although many patients using it for analgesia are able to use it for extended periods of time without developing drug-seeking behavior. In abusers, there can be a strong psychological dependence, thus creating an [[addiction]] with repeated use. Physical dependence causes [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]], while psychological dependence can create strong compulsions to use the drug, which can persist for days or weeks after the physical dependence is broken, and has been known to induce anxiety, insomnia, depression, and a range of other persistent mental illnesses. For this reason, psychotherapy is often included in detox programs, sometimes augmented with pharmacological therapies. Hydromorphone is more expensive on the illicit market than heroin,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} despite producing similar effects, thus causing the abuse rates of hydromorphone to be lower than heroin and similar opioids in many areas.

=== Names ===

Hydromorphone is known in various countries around the world by the brand names Hydal, Dimorphone, Sophidone LP, Dilaudid, Hydrostat, Hydromorfan, Hydromorphan, Hymorphan, Laudicon, Opidol, Palladone, Hydromorph Contin and others. An extended-release version of hydromorphone called Palladone was available for a short time in the United States before being voluntarily withdrawn from the market after a July 2005 FDA advisory warned of a high overdose potential when taken with alcohol.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm129288.htm |title = Information for Healthcare Professionals: Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules (marketed as Palladone) |last =  |first =  |date = 15 July 2005 |website =  |publisher = Center for Drug Evaluation and Research |access-date = 16 August 2016 }}</ref> As of March 2010, it is still available in the United Kingdom under the brand name Palladone SR, Nepal under the brand name Opidol, and in most other European countries.

There is an extended-release (once-daily) version of Hydromorphone available (in the United States).<ref name="zalicus.com">{{cite web |url = http://www.zalicus.com/product-pipeline/exalgo.asp |title = zalicus.com |author =  |date =  |website = www.zalicus.com |accessdate = 2 September 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.exalgo.com/hcp/robust-patient-exposure.aspx |title = EXALGO safety profile |author =  |date = 1 March 2013 |website = archive.org |accessdate = 2 September 2017 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130301110751/http://www.exalgo.com/hcp/robust-patient-exposure.aspx |archivedate = 1 March 2013 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>

=== Detection ===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}

Hydromorphone is most commonly detected via blood and urine testing. Hydromorphone is usually detectable via blood screen for up to 24 hours and via urine screen from three to eight days. Urine screen depends on several factors such as age, frequency of use, weight and duration of use. Extremes: a 20-year-old patient with a normal [[body mass index]], who is administered a small dosage would screen positive for up to three days in 95% of tests. Conversely, people who are over 35 years of age and have been administered a heavy dosage with an overweight to obese BMI will tend to test positive up to seven to eight days in 85% of cases.

=== Legal status ===

In the United States, the main drug control agency, the Drug Enforcement Administration, reports an increase in annual aggregate production quotas of hydromorphone from {{convert|766|kg|abbr=off}} in 1998 to {{convert|3300|kg}} in 2006, and an increase in prescriptions in this time of 289%, from about 470,000 to 1,830,000. The 2013 production quota was {{convert|5968|kg}}.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/quotas/2013/fr0620.htm |title = Proposed Adjustments to the Aggregate Production Quotas for Schedule I and II Controlled Substances and Assessment of Annual Needs for the List I Chemicals Ephedrine, Pseudoephedrine, and Phenylpropanolamine for 2013 |publisher = Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Department of Justice |date = 20 June 2014 |accessdate = 26 July 2014 }}</ref>

Like all opioids used for analgesia, hydromorphone is potentially habit-forming and is listed in [[Schedule II controlled substance|Schedule II]] of the United States [[Controlled Substances Act of 1970]] as well as in similar levels under the drugs laws of practically all other countries and is listed in the Single Convention On Narcotic Drugs. The DEA [[ACSCN]] for hydromorphone is 9150.

Hydromorphone is listed under the German [[Betäubungsmittelgesetz]] as a Suchtgift in the most restricted schedule for medicinal drugs; it is similarly controlled in Austria under the SMG and the Swiss BetmG. The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (United Kingdom) and its French, Canadian, Australian, Italian, Czech, Croatian, Slovenian, Swedish, Polish, Spanish, Greek, Russian, and other laws similarly control it, as do virtually all other countries.

=== Use in executions ===

In 2009, [[Capital punishment in Ohio|Ohio approved the use]] of an intramuscular injection of 500&nbsp;mg of hydromorphone and a [[:wikt:supratherapeutic|supratherapeutic]] dose of [[midazolam]] as a backup means of carrying out executions when a suitable vein cannot be found for intravenous injection.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.drc.ohio.gov/public/press/press342.htm |title = Ohio Prisons Director Announces Changes to Ohio’s Execution Process |date = 13 November 2009 |publisher = [[Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction]] |accessdate = 17 January 2014 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130115131421/http://www.drc.ohio.gov/Public/press/press342.htm |archivedate = 15 January 2013 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>

Hydromorphone and midazolam was injected intravenously to execute double-murderer Joseph Wood in Arizona on 24 July 2014. Wood was heavily sedated (''[[surgical anasthesia]]'') within four minutes from start but took almost two hours to transition to stage 4 (cessation of respiration) and death.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-28457460 |title = Arizona execution takes two hours |date = 24 July 2014 |publisher = BBC News |accessdate = 24 July 2014 }}</ref>
