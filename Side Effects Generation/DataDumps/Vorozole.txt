'''Vorozole''' is an [[imidazole]] based [[competitive inhibitor]] of the [[aromatase]] enzyme.  It underwent clinical testing for evaluation for use as an [[antineoplastic]] agent; however it was withdrawn from testing when no difference was detected in the duration of median survival as compared to the progestational agent [[megestrol acetate]] and research instead focused on the other third generation [[aromatase inhibitors]] [[anastrozole]], [[letrozole]] and [[exemestane]]. The enzyme is selective.<ref name="pmid9797019">{{cite journal |author=Goss PE |title=Pre-clinical and clinical review of vorozole, a new third generation aromatase inhibitor |journal=Breast Cancer Res.
