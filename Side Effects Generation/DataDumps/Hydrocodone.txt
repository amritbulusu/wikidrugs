Hydrocodone is prescribed predominantly within the United States, with the [[International Narcotics Control Board]] reporting that 99% of the worldwide supply in 2007 was consumed in the United States.

Hydrocodone is in U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) [[pregnancy category]] C. No adequate and well-controlled studies in humans have been conducted. A newborn of a mother taking opioid medications regularly prior to the birth will be physically dependent. The baby may also exhibit respiratory depression if the opioid dose was high.<ref name=reprexain /> An epidemiological study indicated that opioid treatment during early pregnancy results in increased risk of various birth defects.<ref>{{Cite journal

Symptoms of hydrocodone [[drug overdose|overdose]] include narrowed or widened pupils; slow, shallow, or stopped breathing; slowed or stopped heartbeat; cold, clammy, or blue skin; excessive sleepiness; loss of consciousness; seizures; or death.<ref name='medlineplus' />

==Pharmacology==
As a narcotic, hydrocodone relieves pain by binding to and activating [[opioid receptor]]s, namely the [[μ-opioid receptor]] (MOR), in the central nervous system. It acts primarily on MORs, with about six times lesser affinity to the [[δ-opioid receptor]] (DOR). In blood, 20–50% of hydrocodone is bound to protein.<ref name="pmid21785485"/><ref>{{Cite journal

Hydrocodone is only pharmaceutically available as an [[oral administration|oral]] drug.<ref name="ElliottSmith2016" /> The [[onset of action]] of hydrocodone via this route is 10 to 20 minutes, with a peak effect ([[Tmax (pharmacology)|T<sub>max</sub>]]) occurring at 30 to 60 minutes,<ref name="BruckerKing2015">{{cite book|author1=Mary C.

In 2014, the FDA approved a formulation of hydrocodone called Zohydro ER made by Zogenix Pharmaceuticals. The approval of Zohydro ER was controversial, due to concerns over its potential for [[substance abuse]]. The FDA approved Zohydro ER over the objections of its own review panel, which voted 12 to 2 against approval. The panel stated that if approved, Zohydro ER would likely "be abused, possibly at a rate greater than that of currently available hydrocodone combination products". Thirty [[U.S. state]]s asked the FDA not to approve Zohydro ER in capsule form due to its potency and the ease with which it could be abused, by being crushed and then snorted or injected.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/pain-management/news/20140226/new-painkiller-zohydro-criticized|title=Critics Oppose FDA Approval of Painkiller Zohydro|last1=Rubin|first1=Rita|date=27 February 2014|website=[[WebMD]]|accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref>{{Mcn|date=August 2017}} Zohydro ER was briefly prohibited in Massachusetts before a federal judge ruled that the state's ban was preempted by the earlier federal approval.<ref>{{cite news |last=Heger|first=Monica|date=7 May 2014|title=State challenges to painkiller could threaten FDA authority|url=http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v20/n5/full/nm0514-453.html|newspaper=[[Nature Medicine]]|accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Valencia|first=Milton|date=23 April 2014|title=Mass. limits use of the potent painkiller Zohydro|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/04/22/governor-deval-patrick-administration-enacts-new-restrictions-zohydro/GpIZM4OUOgZg7cWEI8XV5N/story.html|newspaper=[[Boston Globe]]|accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref>

==Detection in body fluids==
Hydrocodone concentrations are measured in blood, plasma, and urine to seek evidence of misuse, to confirm diagnoses of poisoning, and to assist in investigations into deaths. Many commercial opiate screening tests react indiscriminately with hydrocodone, other opiates, and their metabolites, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish hydrocodone uniquely. Blood and plasma hydrocodone concentrations typically fall into the 5–30&nbsp;µg/L range among people taking the drug therapeutically, 100–200&nbsp;µg/L among recreational users, and 100–1,600&nbsp;µg/L in cases of acute, fatal overdosage. Co-administration of the drug with food or alcohol can very significantly increase the resulting plasma hydrocodone concentrations that are subsequently achieved.<ref>Spiller HA.

Hydrocodone was first marketed by Knoll as Dicodid, starting in February 1924 in Germany.This name is analogous to other products the company introduced or otherwise marketed: Dilaudid (hydromorphone, 1926), Dinarkon (oxycodone, 1917), Dihydrin (dihydrocodeine, 1911), and Dimorphan ([[dihydromorphine]]).  Paramorfan is the trade name of dihydromorphine from another manufacturer, as is Paracodin, for dihydrocodeine.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

The name Dicodid was registered in the United States and appears without a monograph as late as 1978 in the [[Physicians' Desk Reference]]; Dicodid may have been marketed to one extent or another in North America in the 1920s and early 1930s.  The drug was pure hydrocodone in small 5 and 10&nbsp;mg tablets, physically similar to the Dilaudid tablets.  It is no longer manufactured by Knoll in Germany, nor is a generic available.  Hydrocodone was never as common in Europe as it is in North America—dihydrocodeine is used for its spectrum of indications. Germany was the number two consumer of hydrocodone until the manufacture of the drug was discontinued there. Now, the world outside the United States accounts for less than 1% of annual consumption.  It was listed as a ''Suchtgift'' under the German Betäubungsmittelgesetz and regulated like morphine.  It became available in the [[Schengen Area]] of the European Union as of 1 January 2002 under Title 76 of the Schengen Treaty.{{Cn|date=August 2017}}
