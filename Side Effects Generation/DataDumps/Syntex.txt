'''Laboratorios Syntex SA''' was a pharmaceutical company formed in [[Mexico City]] in 1944 by [[Russell Marker]] to manufacture therapeutic [[steroid]]s from the Mexican yams called ''cabeza de negro'' (''[[Dioscorea mexicana]]'') and ''Barbasco'' (''[[Dioscorea composita]]''). The demand for barbasco by Syntex initiated the [[Mexican barbasco trade]].<ref>Soto Laveaga, Gabriela (2009). Jungle Laboratories: Mexican peasants, National Projects and the Making of the Pill. Duke University.</ref>

Syntex chemists synthesized [[cortisone]] from [[diosgenin]], a phytosteroid contained in Mexican yams. This synthesis was more economical than the previous [[Merck & Co.]] synthesis, which started with [[bile acids]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Syntex was integrated into [[Hoffmann-La Roche|the Roche group]] in 1994.

==Prominent researchers==
*[[Russell Earl Marker|Russell Marker]] co-founded the company in 1944. In May 1945, realizing that he was being left out of the company's profits, he left the company. When he took his notebooks, the production was hampered because Marker had done the synthesis himself and had coded the reagent bottles.
*[[George Rosenkranz]] had studied at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and was conducting pharmaceutical research in Cuba.<ref>Rosenkranz had fled Nazi Germany to avoid the eventual Holocaust; while in Cuba en route to South America, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor stranded him there. He was able to work there for the duration of the war.</ref> He joined Syntex in 1945 to replace Marker. He hired Djerassi in 1949.
*[[Carl Djerassi]] went to work at Syntex in 1949 as the associate director of chemical research. He remained there through 1951, leaving to join the faculty of the Chemistry Department at Wayne State University (Detroit, Michigan) starting in 1952.
*[[Alejandro Zaffaroni]] developed procedures for identifying and separating steroids using paper chromatography while studying at the University of Rochester, and joined Syntex as a research biochemist in 1951. He became vice-president in 1956, and was appointed president of Syntex's U.S. subsidiary in Palo Alto, California in 1962.
*[[Luis E. Miramontes]] moved from [[UNAM]] to Syntex in 1950 as a researcher under Djerassi. Under the direction of Djerassi and Rosenkranz, he performed the last step of the first synthesis of an orally highly active [[progestin]] on 15 October 1951. The semi-synthetic steroid, norethistrone (19-Nor-17-alpha-ethynyltestosterone), was the first orally highly active progestin, which led to the development of the first [[combined oral contraceptive pill|oral contraceptive pill]]s.
*[[Jerzy Rzedowski]] worked as an explorer botanist. He later became the most prominent plant scientist in Mexico.
*[[Ralph Dorfman]] Joined the company as a consultant in 1960, eventually serving as President of Syntex Research from 1967–1973

==Birth control pill==
Syntex submitted its compound to a laboratory in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], for biological evaluation, and found it was the most active, orally-effective progestational hormone of its time. Syntex submitted a patent application in November 1951. In August 1953, [[G.D. Searle & Co.]] filed for a patent for the synthesis of the double-bond isomer 13 of norethisterone called noretynodrel. Noretynodrel is converted into norethisterone under acidic conditions, such as those in the human [[stomach]], and the new patent did not infringe on the Syntex patent. Searle obtained approval to market noretynodrel before Syntex received its approval. By 1964 three companies including Syntex were marketing 2-mg doses of the Syntex norethisterone.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Scientific misconduct==
Syntex's submission of a fraudulent toxicology analysis of [[naproxen]] largely led to the [[Food and Drug Administration]]'s uncovering of extensive scientific misconduct by [[Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories]] in 1976.<ref name='Marshall 1983-06-10'>{{cite journal | title = The murky world of toxicity testing | journal = Science | date = 1983-06-10 | first = Eliot | last = Marshall | volume = 220 | issue = 4602 | pages = 1130–1132  | bibcode = 1983Sci...220.1130M | url = http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/lnn13c00/pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2012-07-27 | pmid=6857237 | doi=10.1126/science.6857237}}</ref><ref name='NYT 1983-05-16'>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/16/opinion/the-scandal-in-chemical-testing.html | title = The Scandal in Chemical Testing | date = 1983-05-16 | newspaper = The New York Times | accessdate = 2012-07-27 | quote = The problem was discovered only by accident, when a Government official looking for something else pulled out a file of IBT data by mistake.}}</ref><ref name='Merrell 1981'>{{cite journal | title = The Industrial Bio-Test Caper | journal = NCAP News | date = Winter 1981 | first = Paul | last = Merrell | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 2–4 | url = http://www.pesticide.org/get-the-facts/ncap-publications-and-reports/journal-of-pesticide-reform/jpr-vol.2-3-winter-1981.pdf | accessdate = 2012-08-05}}</ref><ref name='Poisoned Research'>{{cite journal | title = Poisoned Research | journal = Mother Jones | date = June 1982 | first = Douglas | last = Foster |author2=Mark Dowie |author3=Steve Hubbell |author4=Irene Moosen |author5=Peter Waldman |author6=Center for Investigative Reporting  | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 38–40, 42–43, 45–48 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nuYDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA37 | accessdate = 2012-07-28}}</ref>
