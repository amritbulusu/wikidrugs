'''Oxymetholone''' (brand names '''Anadrol''', '''Anapolon''', others) is a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]], [[oral administration|orally active]] [[anabolic-androgenic steroid]] (AAS) and [[17α-alkylated AAS|17α-methyl]]ated [[chemical derivative|derivative]] of [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT) which is marketed in the [[United States]], [[Europe]], and elsewhere in the world.<ref name="Elks2014">{{cite book|author=J.

==Medical uses==
The primary clinical applications of oxymetholone include treatment of [[osteoporosis]] and [[anemia]], as well as stimulating [[muscle hypertrophy|muscle growth]] in malnourished or underdeveloped patients.

The drug was approved for human use by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]. Later, non-[[steroid]]al drugs such as [[epoetin alfa]] were developed and proven to be more effective as a treatment for anemia and osteoporosis without the [[side effect]]s of oxymetholone. The drug remained available despite this and eventually found a new use in treating [[AIDS|HIV wasting syndrome]].

Presented most commonly as a 50 [[milligram|mg]] [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablet]], oxymetholone is one of the strongest [[androgen]]ic steroids available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meda.us/products/pi/Anadrol-50_PI.pdf|title=Anadrol-50|date=December 2006|publisher=Meda Pharmaceuticals|accessdate=8 January 2012}}</ref> Similarly, there is a risk of [[Adverse drug reaction|side effects]].<ref name=drugs1>{{cite web | url = http://www.drugs.com/sfx/oxymetholone-side-effects.html | title = Oxymetholone Side Effects | publisher = drugs.com}}</ref><ref name=drugs2>{{cite web | url = http://www.drugs.com/pro/anadrol.html | title = Anadrol Official FDA Information, Side Effects and Uses | publisher = drugs.com}}</ref> Despite very low binding affinity with the [[androgen receptor]], oxymetholone is highly effective in promoting extensive gains in body mass,{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} mostly by greatly improving protein synthesis. For this reason, it is often used by [[bodybuilder]]s and [[sportsperson|athlete]]s.

==Side effects==
{{See also|Anabolic steroid#Adverse effects}}

The common [[side effect]]s of oxymetholone include depression, lethargy, headache, swelling, rapid weight gain, [[priapism]], changes in skin color, urination problems, [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], stomach pain (if taken on an empty stomach), loss of appetite, [[jaundice]], breast swelling in men, feeling restless or excited, [[insomnia]], and [[diarrhea]].<ref name=drugs1/>  In women, side effects also include [[acne]], changes in [[menstrual period]]s, deepened voice, hair growth on the chin or chest, [[male pattern baldness]], enlarged [[clitoris]], and changes in [[sex drive]].<ref name=drugs1/> Because of its 17α-alkylated structure, oxymetholone is highly [[hepatotoxic]]. Long term use of the drug can cause a variety of serious ailments, including [[hepatitis]], [[hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]], and [[cirrhosis]]; therefore periodic liver function tests are recommended for those taking oxymetholone.<ref name=drugs2/>

==Pharmacology==
Like other AAS, oxymetholone is an [[agonist]] of the [[androgen receptor]] (AR).<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /> It is not a substrate for [[5α-reductase]] and is a poor substrate for [[3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]] (3α-HSD), and therefore shows a high ratio of [[anabolic]] to [[androgenic]] activity.<ref name="Llewellyn2009" />

As a DHT derivative, oxymetholone is not a [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] for [[aromatase]] and hence cannot be aromatized into [[estrogen]]ic [[metabolite]]s.<ref name="Llewellyn2009">{{cite book|author=William Llewellyn|title=Anabolics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=afKLA-6wW0oC|year=2009|publisher=Molecular Nutrition Llc|isbn=978-0967930473|pages=149}}</ref> However, uniquely among DHT derivatives, oxymetholone is nonetheless associated with relatively high estrogenicity, and is known to have the potential to produce estrogenic side effects such as [[gynecomastia]] (rarely) and [[water retention (medicine)|water retention]].<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /><ref name="pmid12646793">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hengge UR, Stocks K, Wiehler H, Faulkner S, Esser S, Lorenz C, Jentzen W, Hengge D, Goos M, Dudley RE, Ringham G | title = Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase III trial of oxymetholone for the treatment of HIV wasting | journal = AIDS | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 699–710 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12646793 | doi = 10.1097/01.aids.0000050853.71999.16 | url = }}</ref><ref name="CORTESGALLEGOSCASTANEDA1982">CORTESGALLEGOS, V., CASTANEDA, G., ALONSO, R., PEREZPASTEN, E., REYESLUGO, V., BARRON, C., ... & VILLALPANDO, S.
