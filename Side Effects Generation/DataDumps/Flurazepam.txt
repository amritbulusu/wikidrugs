'''Flurazepam'''<ref>{{cite patent | country = BE | number = 629005}}</ref> (marketed under the brand names '''Dalmane''' and '''Dalmadorm''') is a drug which is a [[benzodiazepine]] derivative. It possesses [[anxiolytic]], [[anticonvulsant]], [[hypnotic]], [[sedative]] and [[skeletal muscle relaxant]] properties. It produces a metabolite with a long [[half-life]], which may stay in the bloodstream for days.<ref name="dailymed.nlm.nih.gov">[http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/archives/fdaDrugInfo.cfm?archiveid=8226]</ref>

<!-- History, society and culture -->
Flurazepam was initially patented in 1963 and went on sale in the United States in 1970.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shorter|first1=Edward|title=A Historical Dictionary of Psychiatry|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-029201-0|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=juAJCAAAQBAJ&pg=PT66|chapter=B}}</ref>

== Medical uses ==
[[File:Dalmane15mg.jpg|thumb|right]]
Flurazepam is officially indicated for mild to moderate insomnia and as such it is used for short-term treatment of patients with mild to moderate [[insomnia]] such as difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakening, early awakenings or a combination of each. Flurazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine and is sometimes used in patients who have difficulty in maintaining sleep.  Flurazepam is still available in the United States. Intermediate half-life benzodiazepines are also useful for patients with difficulty in maintaining sleep (e.g. [[loprazolam]], [[lormetazepam]], [[temazepam]]).

== Side effects ==
The most common adverse effects are dizziness, drowsiness, light-headedness, and [[ataxia]]. Flurazepam has abuse potential and should never be used with [[alcoholic beverage]]s or any other substance that can cause drowsiness.  Addictive and possibly fatal results may occur. Flurazepam users should only take this drug strictly as prescribed, and should only be taken directly before the user plans on sleeping a full night. Next day drowsiness is common and may increase during the initial phase of treatment as accumulation occurs until steady-state plasma levels are attained.

=== Tolerance, dependence and withdrawal ===
{{Main|Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome}}
A review paper found that long-term use of flurazepam is associated with [[drug tolerance]], [[drug dependence]], [[rebound insomnia]] and CNS related adverse effects. Flurazepam is best used for a short time period and at the lowest possible dose to avoid complications associated with long-term use. Non-pharmacological treatment options however, were found to have sustained improvements in sleep quality.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kirkwood CK |title=Management of insomnia |journal=J Am Pharm Assoc (Wash) |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=688–96; quiz 713–4 |year=1999 |pmid=10533351 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Flurazepam and other benzodiazepines such as [[fosazepam]], and [[nitrazepam]] lost some of their effect after seven days administration in [[psychogeriatric]] patients.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Viukari M |author2=Linnoila M |author3=Aalto U.  |date=January 1978 | title = Efficacy and side effects of flurazepam, fosazepam, and nitrazepam as sleeping aids in psychogeriatric patients | journal = [[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]] | volume = 57 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–35 | pmid = 24980 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1978.tb06871.x }}</ref> Flurazepam shares cross tolerance with barbiturates and [[barbiturates]] can easily be substituted by flurazepam in those who are habituated to barbiturate sedative hypnotics.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Rooke KC. | year = 1976 | title = The use of flurazepam (dalmane) as a substitute for barbiturates and methaqualone/diphenhydramine (mandrax) in general practice | journal = J Int Med Res. | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 355–9 | pmid = 18375 | doi=10.1177/030006057600400510}}</ref>

After discontinuation of flurazepam a [[rebound effect]] or [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]] may occur about four days after discontinuation of medication.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hindmarch I. |date=November 1977 | title = A repeated dose comparison of three benzodiazepine derivative (nitrazepam, flurazepam and flunitrazepam) on subjective appraisals of sleep and measures of psychomotor performance the morning following night-time medication | journal = [[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]] | volume = 56 | issue = 5 | pages = 373–81 | pmid = 22990 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1977.tb06678.x }}</ref>

== Contraindications and special caution ==
Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with [[comorbid]] [[psychiatric disorders]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Authier | first1 = N. | last2 = Balayssac | first2 = D. | last3 = Sautereau | first3 = M. | last4 = Zangarelli | first4 = A. | last5 = Courty | first5 = P. | last6 = Somogyi | first6 = AA. | last7 = Vennat | first7 = B. | last8 = Llorca | first8 = PM. | last9 = Eschalier | first9 = A. | title = Benzodiazepine dependence: focus on withdrawal syndrome | journal = Ann Pharm Fr | volume = 67 | issue = 6 | pages = 408–13 |date=November 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharma.2009.07.001 | pmid = 19900604  }}</ref>

=== Elderly ===
Flurazepam, similar to other benzodiazepines and [[nonbenzodiazepine]] [[hypnotic]] drugs causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. The combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial, but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments.<ref name="Mets-2010">{{cite journal | last1 = Mets | first1 = MA. | last2 = Volkerts | first2 = ER. | last3 = Olivier | first3 = B. | last4 = Verster | first4 = JC. | title = Effect of hypnotic drugs on body balance and standing steadiness. | journal = Sleep Med Rev | volume = 14 |date=Feb 2010 | issue = 4 | pages = 259–67 | doi = 10.1016/j.smrv.2009.10.008 | pmid = 20171127 }}</ref> An extensive review of the medical literature regarding the management of insomnia and the elderly found that there is considerable evidence of the effectiveness and durability of non-drug treatments for insomnia in adults of all ages and that these interventions are underutilized. Compared with the benzodiazepines including flurazepam, the [[nonbenzodiazepine]] sedative-hypnotics appeared to offer few, if any, significant clinical advantages in efficacy in elderly persons. Tolerability in elderly patients, however, is improved marginally in that benzodiazepines have moderately higher risks of falls, memory problems, and disinhibition ("paradoxical agitation") when compared to non-benzodiazepine sedatives. It was found that newer agents with novel mechanisms of action and improved safety profiles, such as the melatonin agonists, hold promise for the management of chronic insomnia in elderly people. Chronic use of sedative-hypnotic drugs for the management of insomnia does not have an evidence base and has  been discouraged due to concerns including potential adverse drug effects as cognitive impairment ([[anterograde amnesia]]), daytime sedation, motor incoordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls. In addition, the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of sedative hypnotics has been determined to be no better than placebo after 3 months of therapy and worse than placebo after 6 months of therapy. (NEJM, 1983, 1994, et seq.)<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Am J Geriatr Pharmacother |date=June 2006 | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 168–92 | title = Management of chronic insomnia in elderly persons | author = Bain KT | pmid = 16860264 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjopharm.2006.06.006}}</ref>

== Pharmacology ==
Flurazepam is a "classical" benzodiazepine; some other classical benzodiazepines include [[diazepam]], [[clonazepam]], [[oxazepam]], [[lorazepam]], [[nitrazepam]], [[bromazepam]], and [[clorazepate]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Braestrup C |author2=Squires RF. | date=1 April 1978| title = Pharmacological characterization of benzodiazepine receptors in the brain | journal = Eur J Pharmacol | volume = 48 | issue = 3 | pages = 263–70 | pmid = 639854 | doi = 10.1016/0014-2999(78)90085-7 }}</ref> Flurazepam generates an [[active metabolite]] with a very long [[elimination half-life]].<ref name="dailymed.nlm.nih.gov" /> Flurazepam could be therefore unsuitable as a sleeping medication for some individuals due to next-day sedation; however, this same effect may also provide next-day anxiety relief. Residual 'hangover' effects after nighttime administration of flurazepam, such as sleepiness, impaired psychomotor and [[cognitive]] functions, may persist into the next day, which may impair the ability of users to drive safely and increase risks of falls and [[hip fractures]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Vermeeren A. | year = 2004 | title = Residual effects of hypnotics: epidemiology and clinical implications | journal = CNS Drugs. | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 297–328 | pmid = 15089115 | doi = 10.2165/00023210-200418050-00003 }}</ref>

Flurazepam is [[lipophilic]], is metabolized hepatically via oxidative pathways. The main pharmacological effect of flurazepam is to increase the effect of GABA at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor via binding to the benzodiazepine site on the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor causing an increase influx of chloride ions into the GABA<sub>A</sub> neuron.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Oelschläger H. | date =  July 4, 1989 |  title = [Chemical and pharmacologic aspects of benzodiazepines] | journal = Schweiz Rundsch Med Prax. | volume = 78 | issue = 27–28 | pages = 766–72 | pmid = 2570451 | doi=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lehoullier PF, Ticku MK |title=Benzodiazepine and beta-carboline modulation of GABA-stimulated 36Cl-influx in cultured spinal cord neurons |journal=Eur.

Flurazepam is contraindicated in pregnancy. It is recommended to withdraw flurazepam during breast feeding, as flurazepam is excreted in [[breast milk]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Olive G |author2=Dreux C. |date=January 1977 | title = Pharmacologic bases of use of benzodiazepines in peréinatal medicine | journal = Arch Fr Pediatr | volume = 34 | pages = 74–89 | pmid = 851373 | issue = 1 }}</ref>

== Society and culture ==

=== Drug misuse ===
{{See also|Benzodiazepine drug misuse}}
Flurazepam is a drug with potential for misuse. Two types of drug misuse can occur, either recreational misuse where the drug is taken to achieve a high, or when the drug is continued long term against medical advice.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Griffiths RR, Johnson MW |title=Relative abuse liability of hypnotic drugs: a conceptual framework and algorithm for differentiating among compounds |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=66 Suppl 9 |issue= |pages=31–41 |year=2005 |pmid=16336040 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

=== Legal status ===
Flurazepam is a Schedule IV drug under the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.incb.org/incb/en/psychotropic-substances/green-lists.html|title=green-lists|work=incb.org}}</ref>
