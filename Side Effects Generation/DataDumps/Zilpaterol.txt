==Processor adoption and bans==
[[Tyson Foods]] was the first among the largest U.S. meatpackers to adopt Zilmax. Because of concerns about tenderness and loss of marbling, Cargill and other meatpackers resisted the practice. The next adopters were [[JBS S.A.|JBS]] and [http://www.nationalbeef.com National Beef], with [[Cargill]] finally joining them in mid-2012.

On August 6, 2013 [[Tyson Foods]] banned Zilmax-fed cattle from its processing plants after cattle began arriving with missing hooves in large numbers during hot weather.<ref>http://www.businessinsider.com/why-merck-halted-sales-of-zilmax-2013-12</ref>

This drug is banned in China, Taiwan, Russia, and many countries in the European Union.<ref>http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/08/09/210538430/did-tyson-drop-zilmax-fed-beef-to-appease-foreign-buyers</ref><ref>https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/29/us-beef-usa-taiwan-idUSBRE99S0IO20131029</ref>

== Chemistry ==
Zilpaterol has two [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] carbons and consequently four optical [[enantiomer]]s. These enantiomers are: (6''R'',7''R'')-, (6''R'',7''S'')-, (6''S'',7''R'')- and (6''S'',7''S'')-. RU 42173 corresponds to racemic ''trans''-zilpaterol hydrochloride, a mixture of the (6''R'',7''R'')-(−)- and (6''S'',7''S'')-(+)-enantiomers.<ref name="FAO" />
