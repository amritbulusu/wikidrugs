'''Lomerizine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) (also known as KB-2796) is a diphenylpiperazine class L-type and T-type [[calcium channel blocker]].<ref name="pmid19913075">{{cite journal |vauthors=Selt M, Bartlett CA, Harvey AR, Dunlop SA, Fitzgerald M |title=Limited restoration of visual function after partial optic nerve injury; a time course study using the calcium channel blocker lomerizine |journal=Brain Res. Bull. |volume= 81|issue= 4–5|pages= 467–471|date=November 2009 |pmid=19913075 |doi=10.1016/j.brainresbull.2009.11.004 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0361-9230(09)00354-2}}</ref>   This drug is currently used clinically for the treatment of [[migraine]]s, while also being used experimentally for the treatment of [[glaucoma]] and optic nerve injury.

==Solubility==

Due to its lipophilic nature and small molecular size, lomerizine is able to cross the [[blood brain barrier]].  For delivery in aqueous systems, nanoparticle therapy may be used.<ref name=Evans2012>{{cite journal|last1=Evans|first1=Cameron W.|last2=Latter|first2=Melissa J.|last3=Ho|first3=Diwei|last4=Peerzade|first4=Saquib Ahmed M.

==Mechanism of Action==

Lomerizine works as a calcium antagonist<ref name=Tamaki2003>{{cite journal|last1=Tamaki|first1=Y|last2=Araie|first2=M|last3=Fukaya|first3=Y|last4=Nagahara|first4=M|last5=Imamura|first5=A|last6=Honda|first6=M|last7=Obata|first7=R|last8=Tomita|first8=K|title=Effects of lomerizine, a calcium channel antagonist, on retinal and optic nerve head circulation in rabbits and humans.|journal=Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science|date= November 2003|volume=44|issue=11|pages=4864–71|pmid=14578410|doi=10.1167/iovs.02-1173}}</ref> by blocking [[voltage-dependent calcium channel]]s.<ref name=Fitzgerald2009>{{cite journal|last1=Fitzgerald|first1=M|last2=Payne|first2=SC|last3=Bartlett|first3=CA|last4=Evill|first4=L|last5=Harvey|first5=AR|last6=Dunlop|first6=SA|title=Secondary retinal ganglion cell death and the neuroprotective effects of the calcium channel blocker lomerizine.|journal=Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science|date=November 2009|volume=50|issue=11|pages=5456–62|pmid=19474405|doi=10.1167/iovs.09-3717}}</ref>  A study using [<sup>3</sup>H]Nitrendipine showed that lomerizine allosterically inhibits binding in calcium channels at a site different than the 1,4 dihydropyridine binding site.<ref name=iwamoto1988>{{cite journal|last1=Iwamoto|first1=T|last2=Morita|first2=T|last3=Kanazawa|first3=T|last4=Ohtaka|first4=H|last5=Ito|first5=K|title=Effects of KB-2796, a new calcium antagonist, and other diphenylpiperazines on [3H]nitrendipine binding.|journal=Japanese journal of pharmacology|date=October 1988|volume=48|issue=2|pages=241–7|pmid=2850381|doi=10.1254/jjp.48.241}}</ref> However, its antimigraine effects are believed to be due not to the blocking of calcium channels, but to the antagonizing effects of lomerizine on the [[5-HT2A receptor|5HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor]]. The drug was shown to competitively inhibit binding of [<sup>3</sup>H]spiperone to 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors, inhibiting the 5-HT driven release of Ca<sup>2+</sup>.
Lomerizine treatment of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> expressing cells led to the inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in response to [[5-HT]], while Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in response to [[Adenosine Triphosphate|ATP]] was unaffected.<ref name=ishii2009>{{cite journal|last1=Ishii|first1=M|last2=Kobayashi|first2=S|last3=Ohkura|first3=M|last4=Yamamoto|first4=R|last5=Shimizu|first5=S|last6=Kiuchi|first6=Y|title=Inhibitory effect of lomerizine, a prophylactic drug for migraines, on serotonin-induced contraction of the basilar artery.|journal=Journal of pharmacological sciences|date=October 2009|volume=111|issue=2|pages=221–5|pmid=19783864|doi=10.1254/jphs.09205sc}}</ref> By preventing the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, lomerizine prevents [[serotonin]]-induced contraction of the [[basilar artery]], which can lead to migraines.

Lomerizine has also been shown to possess neuroprotective effects, specifically in the case of retinal damage.  Doses of .03&nbsp;mg/kg given intravenously as a pretreatment were shown to prevent [[glutamate-induced neurotoxicity]], while also providing protection against [[NMDA]]-induced and [[kainate]]-induced neurotoxicity. Lomerizine was shown to have little affinity for NMDA or kainate receptors, so its protectivity against neurotoxicity in these cases is believed to be due to the blocking of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through voltage-dependent calcium channels.<ref name=Hara2004>{{cite journal|last1=Hara|first1=H|last2=Toriu|first2=N|last3=Shimazawa|first3=M|title=Clinical potential of lomerizine, a Ca2+ channel blocker as an anti-glaucoma drug: effects on ocular circulation and retinal neuronal damage.|journal=Cardiovascular drug reviews|date=2004|volume=22|issue=3|pages=199–214|pmid=15492768|doi=10.1111/j.1527-3466.2004.tb00141.x}}</ref>  By blocking these channels and preventing Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, lomerizine increases circulation in the [[optic disc|optic nerve head]]. These effects show that lomerizine may prove to be a useful treatment for ischemic retinal diseases, such as glaucoma.<ref name=Hara2004 />

Lomerizine also shows neuroprotective effects against secondary degeneration resulting from injury in [[retinal ganglion cells]].  In this case, increased membrane depolarization, in conjunction with the inability of the [[sodium-calcium exchanger]] to function due to depleted ATP stores, causes the activation of calcium-dependent signal transduction.  These processes lead to cell death through either apoptosis or necrosis.<ref name=Fitzgerald2009 />  Lomerizine's role in blocking Ca<sup>2+</sup> can rescue these cells from death by preventing excitotoxicity.  Decreased intracellular calcium also prevents necrosis by decreasing permeability, and apoptotic death is reduced through the reduction of calcium-dependent apoptotic agents.<ref name=Fitzgerald2009 />

While some calcium-channel blockers, such as [[flunarizine]], act on the dopaminergic system, lomerizine is ineffective ''in vivo'' at inhibiting the release of dopamine.  However, it has been observed to weakly inhibit the binding of [<sup>3</sup>H]spiperone to D2 [[dopamine receptors]] ''in vitro''.<ref name=ikegami1992>{{cite journal|last1=Ikegami|first1=A|last2=Ozaki|first2=A|last3=Hara|first3=H|last4=Sukamoto|first4=T|last5=Yamashita|first5=A|last6=Ito|first6=K|title=Neurochemical investigation on the effects of a new diphenylpiperazine calcium antagonist, KB-2796, on the central dopaminergic system of rats.|journal=Japanese journal of pharmacology|date=April 1992|volume=58|issue=4|pages=399–405|pmid=1405037|doi=10.1254/jjp.58.399}}</ref>  While researchers are unsure of the reason for this difference, one hypothesis is that the doses administered cannot reach a high enough concentration in the brain to affect [[D2 receptors]].<ref name=ikegami1992 />

==Medical Use==

Lomerizine is typically taken orally in a dose of 2 to 10&nbsp;mg two to three times a day,<ref name=Hara2004 /> but doses of 20&nbsp;mg are not uncommon.<ref name=imai2007>{{cite journal|last1=Imai|first1=Noboru|last2=Konishi|first2=Takashi|last3=Serizawa|first3=Masahiro|last4=Okabe|first4=Takashi|title=Do the Effects of Long-term Lomerizine Administration Differ with Age?|journal=Internal Medicine|date=2007|volume=46|issue=10|pages=683–684|doi=10.2169/internalmedicine.46.6409}}</ref>  It is also available in an intravenous solution of lomerizine hydrochloride, but the preferred route of administration, especially for treatment of the optic nerve, is oral.<ref name=Hara2002 />

In a clinical study, long-term lomerizine usage was shown to be both safe and effective in the treatment of migraines.  However, efficacy of the drug decreases with age, with a significant correlation between age and efficacy at preventing migraine attacks.<ref name=imai2007 />  Efficacies of 47% to 71% have been reported, and gender seems to have no effect on efficacy of the drug.

Lomerizine may cause drowsiness and flushing, but it lacks the serious cardiovascular effects and hypotension produced by other calcium antagonists.  This is hypothesized to be due to the drug's selectivity for cerebral arteries<ref name=Tamaki2003 /> over peripheral arteries.  No other side effects have been reported.

The acute toxicity for lomerizine in mice was found to be 44&nbsp;mg/kg intravenously, 300&nbsp;mg/kg orally, and over 1,200&nbsp;mg/kg subcutaneously.  Overdose can result in seizures or convulsions.  The toxicity in humans has not been reported.<ref name=MSDSLomerizine>{{cite web|title=Material Safety Data Sheet for Lomerizine Dihydrochloride|url=http://www.chemblink.com/MSDS/MSDSFiles/101477-54-7_Sigma-Aldrich.pdf|website=Chemblink|publisher=Sigma-Aldrich}}</ref>
