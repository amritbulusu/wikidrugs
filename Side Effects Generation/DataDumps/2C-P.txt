'''2C-P''' is a relatively potent and long acting [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] [[phenethylamine]] and [[2C (psychedelics)|2C]] compound first synthesized by [[Alexander Shulgin]].

==Chemistry==
2C-P is 2,5-[[methoxy|dimethoxy]]-4-''n''-[[propyl]][[phenethylamine]].  The full name of the chemical is 2-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-propylphenyl)ethanamine. The hydrochloride salt is the most common form, normally found as a white powder,<ref name="erowid images">[https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/2cp/2cp_images.shtml Erowid 2C-P Vault : Images]</ref>{{rs|date=October 2017}} or white crystals.<ref name="pihkal">[https://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal036.shtml 2C-P Entry in PiHKAL]</ref>
Shulgin's 2C-P crude freebase (soluble in chloroform), after "removal of the solvent under vacuum," was an [[off-white]] colored oil which he [[distillation|distilled]] at 100–110&nbsp;°C at {{convert|0.3|mmHg|Pa|order=flip|abbr=on}} (turning it "water white" in color), and it "spontaneously crystallized" upon cooling.

==Effects==
2C-P produces intense [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic]], [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]], and [[entheogen]]ic effects including open eye visualizations and [[Closed-eye hallucinations|closed-eye visualizations]].<ref name="pihkal"/> It can have a very slow onset if ingested, and peak effects reportedly do not occur for 3 to 5 hours.<ref name="pihkal"/> The peak lasts for five to ten hours, with the overall experience lasting up to 20 hours.

==Dose==
In his book ''[[PiHKAL]]'', Shulgin listed 2C-P's dosage range as 6–10&nbsp;mg and wrote that while most reports with dosages between 6 and 12&nbsp;mg were favorable, "there was one report of an experience in which a single dosage of 16&nbsp;mg was clearly an overdose, with the entire experiment labeled a physical disaster, not to be repeated."<ref name="pihkal"/> He cautioned readers regarding dosing with 2C-P by commenting that "a consistent observation is that there may not be too much latitude in dosage between that which would be modest, or adequate, and that which would be excessive. The need for individual titration would be most important with this compound."<ref name="pihkal"/> 2C-P is one of the most potent compounds in the [[2C (psychedelics)|2C]] family of psychedelics, rivaled only by [[2C-TFM]].

== Overdoses and deaths ==
Overdoses (taking an amount that caused too many unwanted effects) without death have been reported with as little as 12&nbsp;mg orally.<ref name="Notes@Bluelight">[http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=460929 2C-P Notes - First and Second Hand Trip Reports @ Bluelight]</ref>{{rs|date=October 2017}} Unknown (or unreported) dosages taken by teenagers at a [[Connecticut]], USA concert in September 2013 caused seven people to require emergency medical help including [[CPR]] and [[defibrillation]] to resuscitate some of them, with all seven being taken to a hospital and four of those being hospitalized until at least the next day.<ref name="wtnh.com2013">[https://web.archive.org/web/20131127001211/http://www.wtnh.com/news/connecticut/four-overdose-at-quassy-amusement-park-concert Four Overdose at Quassy Amusement Park Concert]</ref>  It was reported that none of the overdose victims died<ref name="hlntv.com">http://www.hlntv.com/video/2013/09/23/2c-p-drug-hallucinate-overdose-concert-party New 'it' drug? Molly's powerful, deadly cousin</ref> while [[CNN]]'s "OutFront" blog claimed the police called it a "mass casualty event"<ref name="outfront">[http://outfront.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/23/police-2c-p-and-molly-involved-in-drug-overdoses-amusement-park-concert/ Police: "2C-P" and "Molly" involved in drug overdoses amusement park concert]</ref> blaming the problems on 2C-P and drugs apparently being sold as "Molly", a common name for [[MDMA]].
