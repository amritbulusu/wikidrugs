'''Ractopamine''' is a [[feed additive]] to promote leanness in animals raised for their meat. Pharmacologically, it is a [[TAAR1 agonist]] and [[Beta-adrenergic agonist|β adrenoreceptor agonist]] that stimulates [[Beta-1 adrenergic receptor|β<sub>1</sub>]] and [[Beta-2 adrenergic receptor|β<sub>2</sub>]] adrenergic receptors.<ref name="TAAR1" /><ref name="Adrenoceptor">{{cite journal|last1=Colbert|first1=WE|last2=Williams|first2=PD|last3=Williams|first3=GD|title=Beta-adrenoceptor Profile of Ractopamine HCl in Isolated Smooth and Cardiac Muscle Tissues of Rat and Guinea-pig|journal=The Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology|date=December 1991|volume=43|issue=12|pages=844–7|pmid=1687583|doi=10.1111/j.2042-7158.1991.tb03192.x}}</ref> It is the active ingredient in products known as Paylean for swine and Optaflexx for cattle, developed by Elanco Animal Health, a division of [[Eli Lilly and Company]], for use in food animals for [[natural growth promoter|growth promotion]].

==Mode of action==
When used as a food additive, ractopamine added to feed can be distributed via the blood to the muscle tissues, where it serves as a [[full agonist]] at mouse (not necessarily human) [[trace amine-associated receptor 1|TAAR1]].<ref name="TAAR1">{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=X|last2=Grandy|first2=DK|last3=Janowsky|first3=A|title=Ractopamine, a livestock feed additive, is a full agonist at trace amine-associated receptor 1.|journal=The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics|date=July 2014|volume=350|issue=1|pages=124–9|doi=10.1124/jpet.114.213116|pmid=24799633|pmc=4170122}}</ref> It is also an agonist at beta-adrenergic receptors.<ref name="Adrenoceptor" /> A cascade of events will then be initiated to increase protein synthesis, which results in increased muscle fiber size.

==Pharmacokinetics in humans==
A study was conducted to define the pharmacological response of humans to ractopamine. A single oral dose of 40&nbsp;mg of ractopamine hydrochloride was given to human volunteers. The drug was rapidly absorbed; the mean blood plasma half-life was around 4&nbsp;hrs and it was not detected in plasma 24&nbsp;hrs after dosing. Less than 5% of total ractopamine excreted represented the parent drug, while the urinary metabolites were monoglucuronide and monosulfate conjugates, with ractopamine monosulfate being the major metabolite present.<ref>RACTOPAMINE (addendum). WHO FOOD ADDITIVES SERIES: 53</ref>

The metabolic fate of ractopamine hydrochloride is similar in the target species (pigs and cattle), laboratory animals, and humans. Besides the pharmacology effect, ractopamine may cause intoxication effect; therefore, any consumption by humans of a meat and/or byproducts of animals that consumed ractopamine with feed for growth stimulation, may result in such clinical effects as tachycardia and other heart rate increases, tremor, headache, muscle spasm, or high arterial blood pressure.<ref>

==Safety concerns==

===Target animal safety===
Ractopamine is safe for finishing pigs heavier than {{convert|240|lb|abbr=on}} when administered in the diet at concentrations up to 10 ppm and fed for up to 35 days.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} However, the number of ractopamine hydrochloride–treated animals exhibiting signs of injury increased during the final drive to slaughter. Since the drug was introduced, more than 160,000 pigs taking ractopamine were reported to have suffered adverse effects, as of March 2011, according to a review of FDA records. The drug has triggered more adverse reports in pigs than any other animal drug on the market. Pigs suffered from hyperactivity, trembling, broken limbs, inability to walk and death, according to FDA reports released under a Freedom of Information Act request.(FDA)<ref>{{cite news |url=http://thefern.org/2012/01/dispute-over-drug-in-feed-limiting-u-s-meat-exports/ |title=Dispute Over Drug in Feed Limiting US Meat Exports |date=January 25, 2012 |work=[[Food and Environment Reporting Network|The Fern]] }}</ref>

[[Colorado State University]] Professor of Animal Science [[Temple Grandin]], an expert on animal welfare, says that she has personally seen harmful effects of ractopamine on feedlot animals, such as cattle with stiff, sore, and lame limbs and symptoms of heat stress, and has stated that some cattle have lost feet due to extreme ractopamine overdoses.<ref name=Rockett2014>{{cite news|last1=Rockett|first1=Caitlin|title=Oops, we forgot to study that: U.S. nonprofits file suit against Food and Drug Administration over ractopamine in our meat|url=http://www.boulderweekly.com/article-13657-oops-we-forgot-to-study-that.html|accessdate=29 November 2014|work=Boulder Weekly|date=November 20, 2014}}</ref> She also asserts that meat from ractopamine-treated animals is tougher.<ref name=Rockett2014 />

Some show lambs have been illegally given ractopamine, either intentionally or due to accidental contamination of their feed.<ref name=BERGIN2014>{{cite news|last1=BERGIN|first1=NICHOLAS|title=Family sues feed company over lamb's failed drug test|accessdate=29 November 2014|work=Lincoln Journal Star|date=March 15, 2014}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==

===Acute toxicity===
Oral {{LD50}} levels in mice and rats are 3547–2545&nbsp;mg/kg body weight (male and female) and 474–365 (male and female), respectively.<ref>{{cite book |title=Safety evaluation of ractopamine |year=2009 |page=10 |url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/scdocs/doc/1041.pdf}}</ref>

===Genotoxicity and mutagenicity===
Mutation studies in [[prokaryote]]s and [[eukaryote]]s show that ractopamine is not mutagenic. However, the results of several ''in vitro'' studies, including chromosome aberration tests in human lymphocytes, are positive. The positive genotoxic results are explained with limited evidence to be due to a secondary auto-oxidative mechanism from ractopamine-catechol-producing reactive intermediates.{{Which|date=April 2013}}{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Carcinogenicity===
Ractopamine is not considered to be a carcinogen and not listed by [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]], [[National Toxicology Program|NTP]], [[ACGIH]], or [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]]. The observation benign [[leiomyomas]] (tumors of smooth muscle) in mice and rats could be due to a general feature of beta-adrenergic activity of ractopamine.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Cardiovascular effects===
Dose-dependent changes of heart rate and cardiac output are observed within the first hour after administration of ractopamine and gradually return to baseline values. The systolic blood pressure will also increase in a dose-dependent manner, while the diastolic pressure remains unchanged.

===Musculoskeletal effects===
Skeletal muscle tremor is the most common adverse effect of beta-agonists, and is more likely to be seen after oral administration than after inhalation. Tremor results from an imbalance between fast- and slow-twitch muscle groups of the extremities, and its severity varies greatly between individuals. No such effects were recorded at the [[NOEL]] determined in the toxicological studies conducted in laboratory animals given ractopamine or in the study in humans on cardiovascular effects of ractopamine.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Behavioral changes in humans===
Restlessness, apprehension, and anxiety were reported effects after the use of various beta-agonists, particularly after oral or parenteral treatment. In pilot clinical trials with ractopamine, four patients showed little evidence for central nervous system stimulation. It is unclear whether long-term treatment with these drugs results in the development of tolerance to these adverse effects.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Analytical method for residues in meat==
The determinative procedure for the analysis of ractopamine residues in tissue can be performed, using liver or muscle as the target tissues, by [[high performance liquid chromatography]]  with fluorescence detection. The confirmatory method include reversed-phase HPLC/electrospray ionization triple tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry. The [[limit of quantification]] of the drug using this LC/MS instrument was shown to be 1&nbsp;ng/g.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sakai T | title = Determination method for ractopamine in swine and cattle tissues using LC/MS | journal = Shokuhin Eiseigaku Zasshi | year = 2007 | volume = 48 | issue = 5 | pages = 144–147 |name-list-format=vanc | display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.3358/shokueishi.48.144 | pmid = 18027547 | last2 = Hitomi | first2 = T | last3 = Sugaya | first3 = K | last4 = Kai | first4 = S | last5 = Murayama | first5 = M | last6 = Maitani | first6 = T}}</ref>

===US-EU WTO dispute===
{{main|Beef hormone controversy}}

In the late 1990s, the [[World Trade Organization]] authorized the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] to impose [[retaliatory tariffs]] of US$116.8 million per year on the [[European Union]] after it found the EU beef hormone ban to be in violation of the WTO [[Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures]] (SPS Agreement).<ref>{{cite web|title=DS26: European Communities — Measures Concerning Meat and Meat Products (Hormones)|publisher=[[World Trade Organization]]|url=https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds26_e.htm}}</ref><ref name=2017-trade-estimate>{{citation|title=2017 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers|pages=148–149|author=[[Office of the United States Trade Representative]]|date=March 2017|url=https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/files/reports/2017/NTE/2017%20NTE.pdf#page=156}}</ref> In September 2009, the United States and the [[European Commission]] signed a memorandum of understanding, which established a new EU duty-free import quota for grain-fed, high quality beef (HQB) as part of a compromise solution.<ref name=2017-trade-estimate/>

===Malaysia===
According to the Malaysian Food Act 1983 and Regulations (as of 5 January 2010), ractopamine is allowed in pig muscle and fat (MRL of 10 ppb), pig liver (MRL of 40 ppb) and pig kidney (MRL of 90 ppb).<ref>Fifteenth A Schedule, Table 1, Maximum Permitted Proportion of Drug Residues in Food.</ref>  Ractopamine is allowed as its half-life is lower, leading to reduced residues in the food, and the dose required to affect humans is much higher than other beta agonists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thestar.com.my/health/story.asp?file=/2006/11/5/health/20061105091851&sec=health |title=Beta-agonists hog the limelight |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=November 5, 2006 |accessdate=January 25, 2012}}</ref>  On 30 December 2008, the Malaysian Veterinary Services Department quarantined 10 of the 656 pig farms in Malaysia, as the livestock were found to contain the banned chemical.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/12/31/nation/2917634&sec=nation |title=Vet Dept seals 10 pig farms |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=December 31, 2008 |accessdate=January 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/12/30/nation/20081230193900&sec=nation |title=10 pig farms under quarantine |date=December 30, 2008 |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64y9S0oHV?url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file%3D/2008/12/30/nation/20081230193900%26sec%3Dnation |archivedate=January 26, 2012}}</ref>

===Russia===
The use of ractopamine in Russia is prohibited. On 6 June 2011, the Russian [[Ministry of Agriculture (Russia)|Ministry of Agriculture]] notified key meat import/exporters in Russia of a future prohibition of ractopamine in meat imported to Russia.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

On 7 December 2012, the prohibition went into force, and pork and beef export to Russia required submission of compliance certificates confirming absence of ractopamine in exported meat.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

<!-- On 11 February 2013 The Ministry introduced prohibitions of the import of frozen meat and meat products from the United States, because the American Veterinary Service does not prohbit ractopamine. Supply of chilled meat for that reason was prohibited on February 4. The head of Rosselkhoznadzor, Sergey Dankvert, said, "Because the violations continue and we identify ractopamine in meat shipped from the US, we plan on February 11, to impose restrictions on the import of these products".
According to Rosselkhoznadzor, laboratory monitoring of US meat products imported to Russia had found another case of ractopamine. This stimulant was found in lots of pork, the company-generated N17D{what?}, and beef liver, received from the company N235.  This is a violation of animal health requirements of the Customs Union and Russia, the report underlines. Rosselkhoznadzor notified the case management of the Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA.-->

==Comparison to clenbuterol==
Similar to ractopamine, [[clenbuterol]] is a growth-promoting compound belonging to the [[Beta-adrenergic agonist|β agonist]] family. It is known to have the effect of enhancing weight gain and proportion of muscle to fat. However, clenbuterol is known to have a much longer half-life in blood than ractopamine, thus has a greater potential for [[bioaccumulation]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} .

Clenbuterol is reported to induce unintended side effects on humans, such as increased heart rate, muscular tremors, headache, nausea, fever, and chills. The US FDA has concluded these side effects to be unacceptable [http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Oa/background/clenbute.htm?redirecthttp=true]. The use of clenbuterol in food animals has been prohibited in almost all countries [http://healthimpactnews.com/2013/the-meat-additive-banned-in-160-countries-but-the-fda-claims-its-safe-for-americans/] .
