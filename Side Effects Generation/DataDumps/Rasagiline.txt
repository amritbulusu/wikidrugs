It was approved in Europe in 2005 and in the US in 2006.

==Medical use==
Rasagiline is used to treat symptoms of [[Parkinson's disease]] both alone and in combination with other drugs. It has shown efficacy in both early and advanced Parkinsons, and appears to be especially useful in dealing with [[Parkinson's disease#Neuropsychiatric|non-motor symptoms]] like fatigue.<ref name=2015RevExpertOpin>Stocchi F, Fossati C1 Torti M.

Rasagiline has not been tested in pregnant women and is Pregnancy Category C in the US.<ref name=Label/>

==Side effects==
The FDA label contains warnings that rasagiline may cause severe [[hypertension]] or [[hypotension]], may make people sleepy, may make motor control worse in some people, may cause hallucinations and psychotic-like behavior, may cause [[impulse control disorder]], may increase the risk of [[melanoma]], and upon withdrawal may cause high fever or confusion.<ref name=Label/>

Side effects when the drug is taken alone include flu-like symptoms, joint pain, depression, stomach upset, headache, dizziness, and insomnia. When taken with [[L-DOPA]], side effects include increased movement problems, accidental injury, sudden drops in blood pressure,  joint pain and swelling, dry mouth, rash, abnormal dreams and digestive problems including vomiting, loss of appetite, weight loss, abdominal pain, nausea, constipation.<ref name=Label/>  When taken with Parkinson's drugs other than L-DOPA, side effects include peripheral edema, fall, joint pain, cough, and insomnia.<ref name=Label/>

===Interactions===
People who are taking [[meperidine]], [[tramadol]], [[methadone]], [[propoxyphene]], [[dextromethorphan]], [[St. John’s wort]], [[cyclobenzaprine]], or another  [[MAO inhibitor]] should not take rasagiline.<ref name=Label/>

The FDA drug label carries a warning of the risk of [[serotonin syndrome]] when rasagiline is used with antidepressants or with [[meperidine]].<ref name=Label/>  However the risk appears to be low, based on a multicenter retrospective study in 1504 people, which looked for serotonin syndrome in people with PD who were treated with rasagiline plus antidepressants, rasagiline without antidepressants, or antidepressants plus Parkinson's drugs other than either rasagiline or selegiline; no cases were identified.<ref name=2015RevExpertOpin/>

There is a risk of psychosis or bizarre behavior if rasagiline is used with dextromethorphan and there is a risk of non-selective MAO inhibition and hypertensive crisis if rasagiline is used with other [[MAOI|MAO inhibitors]].<ref name=Label/>

==Chemistry==
Rasagiline is molecularly a [[propargyl]][[amine]] derivative.<ref name=OrgChemDD2014/>  The form brought to market by Teva and its partners is the mesylate salt, and was  designated chemically as: 1H-Inden-1-amine-2,3-dihydro-N-2-propynyl-(1R)-methanesulfonate.<ref name=Label/>

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
Parkinson's disease is characterized by the death of cells that produce [[dopamine]], a [[neurotransmitter]]. An enzyme called [[monoamine oxidase]] (MAO) breaks down neurotransmitters.  MAO has two forms, [[MAO-A]] and [[MAO-B]].  MAO-B breaks down  [[dopamine]].  Rasagiline prevents the breakdown of dopamine by irreversibly binding to MAO-B. Dopamine is therefore more available, somewhat compensating for the diminished quantities made in the brains of people with Parkinson's.<ref name=2015RevExpertOpin/>

[[Selegiline]] was the first selective MAO-B inhibitor.  It is partly [[Drug metabolism|metabolized]] to [[levomethamphetamine]] (l-methamphetamine), one of the two [[enantiomer]]s of [[methamphetamine]], ''[[in vivo]]''.<ref name="Pmid">{{cite journal |pmid=1658311 |year=1991 |last1=Engberg |first1=G |last2=Elebring |first2=T |last3=Nissbrandt |first3=H |title=Deprenyl (selegiline), a selective MAO-B inhibitor with active metabolites; effects on locomotor activity, dopaminergic neurotransmission and firing rate of nigral dopamine neurons |volume=259 |issue=2 |pages=841–7 |journal=The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics}}</ref><ref name=Foye2012>{{cite book|editor1-last=Lemke|editor1-first=Thomas L.|editor2-last=Williams|editor2-first=David A|title=Foye's Principles of Medicinal Chemistry|date=2012|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=1609133455|page=434}}</ref> While these metabolites may contribute to selegiline's ability to [[reuptake inhibition|inhibit reuptake]] of the neurotransmitters dopamine and [[norepinephrine]], they have also been associated with [[orthostatic hypotension]] and [[hallucination]]s in some people.<ref name=Foye2012/><ref>{{Cite journal|title = Contrasting neuroprotective and neurotoxic actions of respective metabolites of anti-Parkinson drugs rasagiline and selegiline|journal = Neuroscience Letters|date = 2004-01-30|issn = 0304-3940|pmid = 14732458|pages = 169–172|volume = 355|issue = 3|first = Orit|last = Bar Am|first2 = Tamar|last2 = Amit|first3 = Moussa B.

==History==
[[Racemic]] rasagiline was discovered and patented by Aspro Nicholas in the 1970s as a drug candidate for treatment of [[hypertension]].<ref>[https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US3513244.pdf US 3,513,244].  See [https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US5453446.pdf US patent 5453446], lines 50-60.  US Patent 5453446 was the patent at issue in [https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/~/media/Supporting%20Documents/The%20Pink%20Sheet%20DAILY/2013/September/Teva%20Neuroscience%20v%20Watson%20opinion%20092013.pdf Teva v Watson], see page 2</ref>

Moussa Youdim, a biochemist, had been involved in developing [[selegiline]] as a drug for Parkinsons, in collaboration with Peter Reiderer.  He wanted to find a similar compound that would have fewer side effects, and around 1977, at about the same time he moved from London to Haifa to join the faculty of [[Technion]], he noticed that rasagiline could potentially be such a compound.<ref>Judy Sielg-Itzkovich for the Jerusalem Post. November 13, 2010. [http://www.jpost.com/Health-and-Sci-Tech/Health/Making-armor-for-the-brain Making armor for the brain]</ref> He called that compound, AGN 1135.<ref name=Finberg1996/>

In 1996 Youdim, in collaboration with scientists from Technion and the US [[National Institutes of Health]], and using compounds developed with [[Teva Pharmaceutical]], published a paper in which the authors wrote that they were inspired by the racemic nature of deprenyl and the greater activity of one of its steroisomers, L-deprenyl, which became [[selegiline]],  to explore the qualities of the isomers of the Aspro compound, and they found that the R-isomer had almost all the activity; this is the compound that became rasagiline.<ref name=Finberg1996>Finberg JP, Lamensdorf I, Commissiong JW, Youdim MB. Pharmacology and neuroprotective properties of rasagiline. Pharmacology and neuroprotective properties of rasagiline. J Neural Transm Suppl. 1996;48:95-101. {{PMID|8988465}}</ref>  They called the mesylate salt of the R-isomer TVP-1012 and the hydrochloride salt, TVP-101.<ref name=Finberg1996/>

Teva and Technion filed patent applications for this racemically pure compound, methods to make it, and methods to use it to treat Parkinsons and other disorders, and Technion eventually assigned its rights to Teva.<ref>[https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/~/media/Supporting%20Documents/The%20Pink%20Sheet%20DAILY/2013/September/Teva%20Neuroscience%20v%20Watson%20opinion%20092013.pdf Teva v Watson], see page 2</ref>

Teva began [[drug development|development]] of rasagiline, and by 1999 was in Phase III trials, and entered into a partnership with [[Lundbeck]] in which Lundbeck agreed to share the costs and obtained the joint right to market the drug in Europe.<ref>Kupsch A Rasagiline. Teva Pharmaceutical. Curr Opin Investig Drugs. 2002 May;3(5):794-7. {{PMID|12090555}}</ref>  In 2003 Teva partnered with [[Eisai]], giving Eisai the right to jointly market the drug for Parkinson's in the US, and to co-develop and co-market the drug for Alzheimers and other neurological diseases.<ref>[http://www.eisai.com/news/news200312.html Eisai Press Release].  May 15, 2003</ref>

It was approved by the [[European Medicines Agency]] for Parkinson's in 2005<ref name=NRDD2005>Schapira A, Bate G, Kirkpatrick P. Fresh from the Peiple: Rasagiline.  Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2005 Aug;4(8):625-6. {{PMID|16106586}}</ref> and in the US in 2006.<ref name=OrgChemDD2014>Richard B. Silverman, Mark W. Holladay.

==Research==
Rasagiline was tested for efficacy in people with [[multiple system atrophy]] in a large randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind disease-modification trial; the drug failed.<ref>Poewe W, Mahlknecht P, Krismer F Therapeutic advances in multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy. Mov Disord. 2015 Sep 15;30(11):1528-38. {{PMID|26227071}}</ref>

Teva conducted clinical trials attempting to prove that rasagiline did not just treat symptoms, but was a disease-modifying drug - that it actually prevented the death of the dopaminergic neurons that characterize Parkinson's disease and slowed disease progression.  They conducted two clinical trials, called TEMPO and ADAGIO, to try to prove this.  The FDA advisory committee rejected their claim in 2011, saying that the clinical trial results did not prove that rasagiline was neuroprotective. The main reason was that in one of the trials, the lower dose was effective at slowing progression, but the higher dose was not, and this made no sense in light of standard [[Dose–response relationship|dose-response]] pharmacology.<ref>Vadim Sviderski for Reuters and Haaretz.
