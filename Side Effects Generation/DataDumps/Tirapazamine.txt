'''Tirapazamine''' ('''SR-4233''') is an experimental anticancer drug that is activated to a toxic radical only at very low levels of [[oxygen]] ([[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]). Such levels are common in human solid [[tumor]]s, a phenomenon known as [[tumor hypoxia]]. Thus, tirapazamine is activated to its toxic form preferentially in the hypoxic areas of solid tumors. Cells in these regions are resistant to killing by [[radiotherapy]] and most [[chemotherapy|anticancer drugs]]. Thus the combination of tirapazamine with conventional anticancer treatments is particularly effective. {{As of|2006}}, tirapazamine is undergoing phase III testing in patients with [[head and neck cancer]] and gynecological cancer, and similar trials are being undertaken for other solid tumor types.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Denny |first1=WA |title=Prospects for hypoxia-activated anticancer drugs |year=2004 |journal=Current Medicinal Chemistry |pages=395–9 |volume=4 |issue=5  |pmid=15379691 |doi=10.2174/1568011043352812}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gandara |first1=DR |last2=Lara Jr |first2=PN |last3=Goldberg |first3=Z |last4=Le |first4=QT |last5=Mack |first5=PC |last6=Lau |first6=DH |last7=Gumerlock |first7=PH |title=Tirapazamine: prototype for a novel class of therapeutic agents targeting tumor hypoxia |year=2002 |journal=Seminars in oncology |pages=102–9 |volume=29 |issue=1 Suppl 4  |pmid=11894020 |doi=10.1053/sonc.2002.31531}}</ref>

Chemically it is an aromatic heterocycle di-N-oxide. Its full chemical name is 3-amino-1,2,4-benzotriazine-1,4 dioxide. Originally it was prepared in a program screening for new [[herbicide]]s in 1972. Its clinical use was first described by Zeman ''et al.'' in 1986.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zeman |first1=EM |last2=Brown |first2=JM |last3=Lemmon |first3=MJ |last4=Hirst |first4=VK |last5=Lee |first5=WW |title=SR-4233: a new bioreductive agent with high selective toxicity for hypoxic mammalian cells |year=1986 |journal=International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics |pages=1239–42 |volume=12 |issue=7  |pmid=3744945 |doi=10.1016/0360-3016(86)90267-1}}</ref> While tirapazamine has had only limited effectiveness in [[clinical trial]]s,<ref name="pmid19053884">{{cite journal |last1=Reddy |first1=SB |last2=Williamson |first2=SK |title=Tirapazamine: a novel agent targeting hypoxic tumor cells |journal=Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=77–87 |date=January 2009 |pmid=19053884 |doi=10.1517/13543780802567250}}</ref> it has been used as a [[lead compound]] to develop a number of newer compounds with improved anti-cancer properties.<ref name="pmid18847185">{{cite journal |last1=Hay |first1=MP |last2=Hicks |first2=KO |last3=Pchalek |first3=K |last4=Lee |first4=HH |last5=Blaser |first5=A |last6=Pruijn |first6=FB |last7=Anderson |first7=RF |last8=Shinde |first8=SS |last9=Wilson |first9=WR |last10=Denny |first10=William A. |title=Tricyclic 1,2,4Triazine 1,4-Dioxides As Hypoxia Selective Cytotoxins |journal=Journal of Medicinal Chemistry |volume=51 |issue=21 |pages=6853–65 |date=November 2008 |pmid=18847185 |doi=10.1021/jm800967h |pmc=2690574|display-authors=8 }}</ref>

An update of a Phase III trial (Tirapazamine, cisplatin, and radiation versus cisplatin and radiation for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (TROG 02.02, HeadSTART): a phase III trial of the Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group) found no evidence that the addition of TPZ to chemoradiotherapy, in patients with advanced head and neck cancer not selected for the presence of hypoxia, improved overall survival.<ref name=pmid20479425>{{cite journal |last1=Rischin |first1=D |last2=Peters |first2=LJ |last3=O'Sullivan |first3=B |last4=Giralt |first4=J |last5=Fisher |first5=R |last6=Yuen |first6=K |last7=Trotti |first7=A |last8=Bernier |first8=J |last9=Bourhis |first9=J |last10=Ringash |first10=J. |last11=Henke |first11=M. |last12=Kenny |first12=L. |title=Tirapazamine, cisplatin, and radiation versus cisplatin and radiation for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (TROG 02.02, HeadSTART): a phase III trial of the Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group |journal=Journal of clinical oncology |volume=28 |issue=18 |pages=2989–95 |year=2010 |pmid=20479425 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2009.27.4449|display-authors=8 }}</ref>

Two possible molecular mechanisms of TPZ, for generating reactive oxygen species which causes DNA strand break, have been considered widely. In hypoxia, under bioreductive condition, it has been observed that TPZ primarily produces hydroxyl or and benzotriazinyl radicals as the DNA damaging reactive species.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Junnotula | first1=V| last2=Sarkar| first2= Ujjal| first3=Sinha|last3= S|first4= Gates|last4=Kent|title=Initiation of DNA strand cleavage by 1,2,4-benzotriazine 1,4-dioxide antitumor agents: mechanistic insight from studies of 3-methyl-1,2,4-benzotriazine 1,4-dioxide|journal=J Am Chem Soc|volume=131|issue=13|pages= 1015–24|year=2009|pmid=19117394| doi= 10.1021/ja8049645| pmc=2819123}}.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brown | first1= Martin| last2=Wilson| first2= William|title=Exploiting tumour hypoxia in cancer treatment|journal=Nature Reviews Cancer|volume=4| issue= 6|pages= 437–447|year=2004|pmid=15170446|doi=10.1038/nrc1367}}</ref>

A new clinical phase I trial of Tirapazamine combined with embolization in liver cancer has been received in June, 2014. This  study will help to optimize the safe tollerable dose of TPZ, when it is administered with embolization in liver cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02174549|title=Dose-defining Study of Tirapazamine Combined With Embolization in Liver Cancer|work=clinicaltrials.gov}}</ref>
Treatment of solid tumors iscomplicatedd by the fact that these are often poorly provided with blood vessels, thus limiting their exposure to [[cytotoxic agents]]. Attempts have, however, been made to take advantage of the resulting [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxic environment]] by designing drugs that are nonreactive until they are reduced to reactive species in [[oxygen-deficient tissue]]s. This, it is hoped, will lead to enhanced selectivity. The azaquinoxaline dioxide function on the antineoplastic agent tirapazamine, for example, has been shown to give reactive [[nitroxide]] radicals on reduction.

The first step in the synthesis, condensation of [[2-nitroaniline]] ('''1''') with [[cyanamide]], probably involves initial formation of a [[guanidine]] such as '''2'''. This then cyclizes to the heterocycle '''3'''. Oxidation with [[hydrogen peroxide]] then completes the preparation of tirapazamine ('''4''').
