A '''decongestant''', or '''nasal decongestant''', is a type of [[pharmaceutical drug]] that is used to relieve [[nasal congestion]] in the [[upper respiratory tract]]. The active ingredient in most decongestants is either [[pseudoephedrine]] or [[phenylephrine]] (the latter of which has [[Phenylephrine#Decongestant|disputed efficacy]]).

[[Topical decongestant]]s on [[topical administration|topical application]] as dilute solution (0.05–0.1%) produce local [[vasoconstriction]].

Regular use of decongestants for long periods should be avoided because mucosal ciliary function is impaired: atrophic rhinitis and [[anosmia]] can occur due to persistent vasoconstriction.

Decongestants can be absorbed from the nose via an [[inhaler]] and produce systemic effects, mainly [[central nervous system]] stimulation and rise in [[blood pressure]]. These drugs should be used cautiously in hypertensives and in those receiving [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAOIs), as they can cause [[hypertensive crisis]].

[[Expectorant]]s such as [[guaifenesin]] are a related type of drug which help to clear [[mucus]].

==Pharmacology==
The vast majority of decongestants act via enhancing [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline) and [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline) or [[adrenergic]] activity by stimulating the [[adrenergic receptor|α-adrenergic receptor]]s. This induces [[vasoconstriction]] of the [[blood vessel]]s in the [[human nose|nose]], [[throat]], and [[paranasal sinuses]], which results in reduced [[inflammation]] ([[swelling (medical)|swelling]]) and [[mucus]] formation in these areas.

Decongestant nasal sprays and eye drops often contain [[oxymetazoline]] and are used for [[topical decongestant|topical decongestion]]. Pseudoephedrine acts indirectly on the adrenergic receptor system, whereas phenylephrine and oxymetazoline are direct [[agonists]]. The effects are not limited to the nose, and these medicines may cause [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure) through [[vasoconstriction]]; it is for this reason that people with hypertension are advised to avoid them. Most decongestants, however, are not pronounced stimulants, due to lack of response from the other adrenoreceptors. Besides hypertension, common side-effects include sleeplessness, anxiety, dizziness, excitability, and nervousness.

Topical nasal or ophthalmic decongestants quickly develop [[tachyphylaxis]] (''a rapid decrease in the response to a drug after repeated doses over a short period of time''). Long-term use is not recommended, since these agents lose effectiveness after a few days.
