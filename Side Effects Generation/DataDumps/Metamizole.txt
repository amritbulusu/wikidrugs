'''Metamizole''' or '''dipyrone''', is an [[ampyrone]] [[sulfonate]] [[analgesic|painkiller]], [[antispasmodic|spasm reliever]] and [[antipyretic|fever reliever]]. Like [[paracetamol]], it has minimal [[anti-inflammatory]] effects. It is most commonly given orally or parenterally (by injection) to prevent and treat pain related to [[surgery]] or for the treatment of acute pain.<ref name = SPC/><ref name = deranaes2008>{{cite journal|last1=Jage|first1=J|last2=Laufenberg-Feldmann |first2=R |last3=Heid |first3=F|title=Medikamente zur postoperativen Schmerztherapie: Bewährtes und Neues|trans_title=Drugs for postoperative analgesia: routine and new aspects.

==Medical uses==
It is primarily used for perioperative pain, acute injury, [[colic]], cancer pain, other acute/chronic forms of pain and high fever unresponsive to other agents.<ref name = SPC/>

===Special populations===
Its use in pregnancy is advised against, although animal studies are reassuring in that they show minimal risk of birth defects; its use in the elderly or those with liver/kidney impairment is advised against, but if these groups of people must be treated a lower dose and caution is usually advised; its use in lactation is advised against as it is excreted in breast milk.<ref name = SPC/>

==Adverse effects==
Metamizole has a potential of haematologic (blood-related) toxicity (blood [[dyscrasia]]s), but causes less [[renal|kidney]], [[cardiovascular]], and GI toxicity than [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs).<ref name = deranaes2008/> Like NSAIDs, it can trigger bronchospasm or [[anaphylaxis]], especially in those with [[asthma]].<ref name=deranaes2004>{{cite journal |last1=Brack |first1=A |last2=Rittner |first2=HL |last3=Schäfer |first3=M|title=Nichtopioidanalgetika zur perioperativen Schmerztherapie |trans_title=Non-opioid analgesics for perioperative pain therapy.

Serious side effects include [[agranulocytosis]], [[aplastic anaemia]], hypersensitivity reactions (like [[anaphylaxis]] and [[bronchospasm]]), [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]] and it may provoke acute attacks of [[porphyria]], as it is chemically related to the [[sulfonamide]]s.<ref name = MD/><ref name = deranaes2008/><ref name = deranaes2004/> The relative risk for agranulocytosis appears to greatly vary according to the country of estimates on said rate and opinion on the risk is strongly divided.<ref name = MD/><ref name=CurrOpAnesth2014rev>Pogatzki-Zahn E, Chandrasena C, Schug SA. Nonopioid analgesics for postoperative pain management. Curr Opin Anaesthesiol. 2014 Oct;27(5):513-9. {{PMID|25102238}}</ref>

===Contraindications===
Previous hypersensitivity (such as [[agranulocytosis]] or [[anaphylaxis]]) to metamizole or any of the [[excipients]] (e.g. [[lactose]]) in the preparation used, acute [[porphyria]], impaired [[haematopoiesis]] (such as due to treatment with [[chemotherapy]] agents), third trimester of pregnancy (potential for adverse effects in the newborn), lactation, children with a body weight below 16&nbsp;kg, history of aspirin-induced asthma and other hypersensitivity reactions to analgesics.<ref name = SPC/>

Oral [[anticoagulants]] (blood thinners), [[lithium (medication)|lithium]], [[captopril]], [[triamterene]] and [[antihypertensive]]s may also interact with metamizole, as other [[pyrazolone]]s are known to interact adversely with these substances.

===Overdose===
It is considered fairly safe on overdose, but in these cases supportive measures are usually advised as well as measures to limit absorption (such as [[activated charcoal]]) and accelerate excretion (such as [[haemodialysis]]).<ref name = SPC>{{cite web|title=Fachinformation (Zusammenfassung der Merkmale des Arzneimittels) Novaminsulfon injekt 1000 mg Lichtenstein Novaminsulfon injekt 2500 mg Lichtenstein|url=http://www.zentiva.de/Home/Medikamente-und-Produkte/Produkte.htm?ID=28&cmd=getFile&getFile_cid=0900972f80210633|language=German|date=February 2013|accessdate=19 April 2014|work=Winthrop Arzneimittel GmbH|publisher=Zinteva Pharm GmbH}}</ref>

==Physicochemistry==
It is a sulfonic acid and comes in [[calcium]], [[sodium]] and [[magnesium]] salt forms.<ref name = MD/> Its sodium salt [[monohydrate]] form is a white/almost crystalline powder that is unstable in the presence of light, highly soluble in [[water]] and [[ethanol]] but practically insoluble in [[dichloromethane]]<ref>{{cite book |author1=Council of Europe |author2=Council of Europe.

==Pharmacology==
Its precise mechanism of action is unknown, although it is believed that inhibiting [[central nervous system|brain and spinal cord]] [[prostaglandin]] (fat-like molecules that are involved in inflammation, pain and fever) synthesis might be involved.<ref name = deranaes2004/> Recently, researchers uncovered another potential mechanism involving metamizole being a [[prodrug]]. In this proposal, not yet verified by other researchers, the metamizole itself breaks down into other chemicals that are the actual active agents. The result is a couple of [[cannabinoid]] and NSAID [[arachidonic acid]] conjugates{{clarify|date=April 2014}}<!--what *are* they if they're not what this word actually means?--> (although not in the strict [[Conjugated system|chemical meaning of the word]]) of metamizole's breakdown products.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jasiecka|first1=A|last2=Maślanka |first2=T |last3=Jaroszewski |first3=JJ|title=Pharmacological characteristics of metamizole|journal=Polish Journal of Veterinary Sciences|date=2014|volume=17|issue=1|pages=207–14|pmid=24724493 |doi=10.2478/pjvs-2014-0030}}</ref> Despite this studies in animals have found that the [[Cannabinoid receptor 1|first cannabinoid receptor]] is not involved in the analgesia induced by metamizole.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Elmas|first1=P|last2=Ulugol |first2=A|title=Involvement of cannabinoid CB1 receptors in the antinociceptive effect of dipyrone|journal=Journal of Neural Transmission|date=November 2013|volume=120|issue=11|pages=1533–8|doi=10.1007/s00702-013-1052-7|pmid=23784345}}</ref> Although it seems to inhibit fevers caused by prostaglandins, especially [[prostaglandin E2]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Malvar|first1=DD|last2=Aguiar |first2=FA |last3=Vaz |first3=AD |last4=Assis |first4=DC |last5=de Melo |first5=MC |last6=Jabor |first6=VA |last7=Kalapothakis, |first7=E |last8=Ferreira |first8=SH |last9=Clososki |first9=GC |last10=de Souza |first10=GE|title=The dipyrone metabolite 4-MAA induces hypothermia and inhibits PGE<sub>2</sub>-dependent and -independent fever while 4-AA only blocks PGE<sub>2</sub> -dependent fever|journal=British Journal of Pharmacology|date=April 2014|doi=10.1111/bph.12717|pmid=24712707 |volume=171 |issue=15 |pages=3666–79}}</ref> It appears to produce its therapeutic effects by means of its metabolites, especially ''N''-methyl-4-aminoantipyrine (MAA) and 4-aminoantipyrine (AA).<ref name = SPC/>

==History==
[[Ludwig Knorr]] was a student of [[Hermann Emil Fischer|Emil Fischer]] who won the Nobel Prize for his work on purines and sugars, which included the discovery of [[phenylhydrazine]].<ref name=Brune>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1366-0071(97)80033-2 | title = The early history of non-opioid analgesics | year = 1997 | last1 = Brune | first1 = K | journal = Acute Pain | volume = 1 | pages = 33 }}</ref><ref>Nobel Committee [https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1902/fischer-bio.html Emil Fischer – Biographical]</ref> In the 1880s, Knorr was trying to make [[quinolone]] derivatives from phenylhydrazine, and instead made a [[pyrazole]] derivative, which after a methylation, he made into [[phenazone]], also called antipyrine, which has been called "the 'mother' of all modern antipyretic analgesics."<ref name=Brune/><ref name=Ravina>Enrique Ravina. The Evolution of Drug Discovery: From Traditional Medicines to Modern Drugs. John Wiley & Sons, 2011 {{ISBN|9783527326693}}</ref>{{rp|26–27}}  Sales of that drug exploded, and in the 1890s chemists at Teerfarbenfabrik Meister, Lucius & Co. (a precursor of [[Hoechst AG]] which is now [[Sanofi]]), made another derivative called [[pyramidon]] which was three times more active than antipyrine.<ref name=Brune/>

In 1893, a derivative of antipyrine, [[aminopyrine]], was made by [[Friedrich Stolz]] at Hoechst.<ref name=Ravina/>{{rp|26–27}}  Yet later, chemists at Hoechst made a derivative, melubrine (sodium antipyrine aminomethanesulfonate), which was introduced in 1913,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=xZw1AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA869#v=onepage&q&f=false New and Nonofficial Remedies: Melubrine]. JAMA 61(11):869. 1913</ref> and yet later metamizole was synthesized; metamizole is a methyl derivative of melubrine and is also a more soluble prodrug of pyramidon.<ref name=Brune/><ref name=Ravina/>{{rp|26–27}} Metamizole was first marketed in Germany as "Novalgin" in 1922.<ref name=Brune/>
