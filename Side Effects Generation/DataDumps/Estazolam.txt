Estazolam is prescribed for the short-term treatment of certain sleep disorders. It is an effective hypnotic drug showing efficacy in increasing the time spent asleep as well as reducing awakenings during the night. Combination with non-pharmacological options for sleep management results in long-term improvements in sleep quality after discontinuation of short-term estazolam therapy.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Roehrs T, Zorick F, Lord N, Koshorek GL, Roth T |title=Dose-related effects of estazolam on sleep of patients with insomnia |journal=J Clin Psychopharmacol |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=152–6 |date=June 1983 |pmid=6135720 |doi= 10.1097/00004714-198306000-00002|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rosen RC, Lewin DS, Goldberg L, Woolfolk RL |title=Psychophysiological insomnia: combined effects of pharmacotherapy and relaxation-based treatments |journal=Sleep Med. |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=279–288 |date=October 2000 |pmid=11040460 |doi= 10.1016/S1389-9457(00)00042-3|url=}}</ref> Estazolam is also sometimes used as a preoperative sleep aid.

==Tolerance and dependence==
The main safety concern of benzodiazepines such as estazolam is a [[benzodiazepine dependence]] and the subsequent [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]] which can occur upon discontinuation of the estazolam. A review of the literature found that long-term use of benzodiazepines such as estazolam is associated with [[drug tolerance]], [[drug dependence]], [[rebound insomnia]] and CNS related adverse effects. Estazolam should only be used short term and at the lowest effective dose to avoid complications related to long-term use. Non-pharmacological treatment options however, were found to have sustained improvements in sleep quality.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kirkwood CK |title=Management of insomnia |journal=J Am Pharm Assoc (Wash) |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=688–96; quiz 713–4 |year=1999 |pmid=10533351 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Lee YJ |title=Overview of the therapeutic management of insomnia with zolpidem |journal=CNS Drugs |volume=18 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=17–23; discussion 41, 43–5 |year=2004 |pmid=15291010 |doi= 10.2165/00023210-200418001-00005|url=}}</ref> The short-term benefits of benzodiazepines on sleep begin to reduce after a few days due to [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]] to the hypnotic effects of benzodiazepines in the elderly.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Grad RM |title=Benzodiazepines for insomnia in community-dwelling elderly: a review of benefit and risk |journal=J Fam Pract |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=473–81 |date=November 1995 |pmid=7595266 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

==Contraindications and special caution==
Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with [[comorbid]] [[psychiatric disorders]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Authier | first1 = N. | last2 = Balayssac | first2 = D. | last3 = Sautereau | first3 = M. | last4 = Zangarelli | first4 = A. | last5 = Courty | first5 = P. | last6 = Somogyi | first6 = AA. | last7 = Vennat | first7 = B. | last8 = Llorca | first8 = PM. | last9 = Eschalier | first9 = A. | title = Benzodiazepine dependence: focus on withdrawal syndrome | journal = Ann Pharm Fr | volume = 67 | issue = 6 | pages = 408–13 |date=November 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharma.2009.07.001 | pmid = 19900604  }}</ref>

==Elderly==
An extensive review of the medical literature regarding the management of insomnia and the elderly found that there is considerable evidence of the effectiveness and durability of non-drug treatments for insomnia in adults of all ages and that these interventions are underutilized. Compared with the benzodiazepines including estazolam, the [[nonbenzodiazepine]] sedative-hypnotics appeared to offer few, if any, significant clinical advantages in efficacy or tolerability in elderly persons. It was found that newer agents with novel mechanisms of action and improved safety profiles, such as the melatonin agonists, hold promise for the management of chronic insomnia in elderly people. Long-term use of sedative-hypnotics for insomnia lacks an evidence base and has traditionally been discouraged for reasons that include concerns about such potential adverse drug effects as cognitive impairment ([[anterograde amnesia]]), daytime sedation, motor incoordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls. In addition, the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of these agents remain to be determined. It was concluded that more research is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of treatment and the most appropriate management strategy for elderly persons with chronic insomnia.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Am J Geriatr Pharmacother |date=June 2006 | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 168–92 | title = Management of chronic insomnia in elderly persons | author = Bain KT | pmid = 16860264 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjopharm.2006.06.006}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==
Estazolam is classed as a "triazolo" benzodiazepine drug.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Braestrup C |author2=Squires RF. | date=1 April 1978| title = Pharmacological characterization of benzodiazepine receptors in the brain | journal = Eur J Pharmacol | volume = 48 | issue = 3 | pages = 263–70 | pmid = 639854 | doi = 10.1016/0014-2999(78)90085-7 }}</ref> Estazolam exerts its therapeutic effects via its benzodiazepines receptor agonist properties.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Akbarzadeh T, Tabatabai SA, Khoshnoud MJ, Shafaghi B, Shafiee A |title=Design and synthesis of 4H-3-(2-phenoxy)phenyl-1,2,4-triazole derivatives as benzodiazepine receptor agonists |journal=Bioorg.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Peak plasma levels are achieved within 1–6 hours. Estazolam is an intermediate acting [[benzodiazepine]]. The [[elimination half life]] of estazolam is an average of 19 hours, with a range of 8–31 hours.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Allen MD, Greenblatt DJ, Arnold JD |title=Single- and multiple-dose kinetics of estazolam, a triazolo benzodiazepine |journal=Psychopharmacology |volume=66 |issue=3 |pages=267–74 |year=1979 |pmid=43552 |doi= 10.1007/BF00428318|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mancinelli A, Guiso G, Garattini S, Urso R, Caccia S |title=Kinetic and pharmacological studies on estazolam in mice and man |journal=Xenobiotica |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=257–65 |date=March 1985 |pmid=2862746 |doi= 10.3109/00498258509045357|url=}}</ref> The major metabolite of estazolam is 4-hydroxyestazolam.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Miura M, Otani K, Ohkubo T |title=Identification of human cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the formation of 4-hydroxyestazolam from estazolam |journal=Xenobiotica |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=455–65 |date=May 2005 |pmid=16012077 |doi= 10.1080/00498250500111612|url=}}</ref>

==EEG effects in rabbits==
An animal study in rabbits demonstrated that estazolam induces a drowsy pattern of spontaneous [[EEG]] including high voltage slow waves and spindle bursts increase in the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] and [[amygdala]], while the [[hippocampal]] theta rhythm is desynchronized. Also low voltage fast waves occur particularly in the [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] EEG. The EEG arousal response to [[Sound|auditory]] stimulation and to electric stimulation of the mesencephalic reticular formation, [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] [[hypothalamus]] and centromedian [[thalamus]] is significantly suppressed. The [[photic driving response]] elicited by a flash light in the [[visual cortex]] is significantly suppressed by estazolam.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Watanabe S |author2=Ohta H |author3=Sakurai Y |author4=Takao K |author5=Ueki S.  |date=July 1986 | title = [Electroencephalographic effects of 450191-S and its metabolites in rabbits with chronic electrode implants] | journal = Nippon Yakurigaku Zasshi. | volume = 88 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–32 | pmid = 3758874 | doi=10.1254/fpj.88.19}}</ref>

==Abuse==
