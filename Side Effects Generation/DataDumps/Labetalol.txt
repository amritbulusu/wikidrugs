Labetalol's dual [[Alpha blocker|alpha]] and [[Beta blocker|beta]] adrenergic antagonism has different physiological effects in short- and long-term situations. In short-term, acute situations, labetalol decreases blood pressure by decreasing [[systemic vascular resistance]] with little effect on [[stroke volume]], heart rate and cardiac output.<ref name=":8" /> During long-term use, labetalol can reduce heart rate during exercise while maintaining [[cardiac output]] by an increase in [[stroke volume]].<ref name=":5" />

==Medical uses==
Labetalol is effective in the management of&nbsp;[[Hypertensive emergency|hypertensive emergencies]], postoperative hypertension,&nbsp;[[pheochromocytoma]]-associated hypertension, and&nbsp;[[rebound hypertension]]&nbsp;from&nbsp;[[beta blocker]]&nbsp;withdrawal.&nbsp;<ref name=":02">{{Cite book|title = Koda-Kimble and Young's Applied Therapeutic: The Clinical Use of Drugs|last = Koda-Kimble|first = Mary A.|publisher = Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|year = 2013|isbn = 978-1-60913-713-7|location = Philadelphia|last2 = Alldredge|first2 = Brian K.|chapter = 21}}</ref>

It has a particular indication in the treatment of&nbsp;[[pregnancy-induced hypertension]]&nbsp;which is commonly associated with&nbsp;[[pre-eclampsia]].&nbsp;<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Severe pre-eclampsia and hypertensive crises|last = Arulkumaran|first = N|date = December 2013|journal = Best practice & research.

It is also used as an alternative in the treatment of severe hypertension.<ref name=":02" />

=== Special populations ===
'''Pregnancy''': Studies in lab animals showed no harm to the fetus. However, a comparable well-controlled study has not been performed in pregnant women.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2010/018716s026lbl.pdf|title = Trandate|date = November 2010|accessdate = 3 November 2015|website = |publisher = Prometheus Laboratories Inc}}</ref>

'''Nursing''': Breast milk has been shown to contain small amounts of labetalol (0.004% original dose). Prescribers should be cautious in the use of labetalol for nursing mothers.<ref name=":0" />

'''Pediatric''': No studies have established safety or usefulness in this population.<ref name=":0" />

'''Geriatric''': The elderly are more likely to experience [[dizziness]] when taking labetalol. Labetalol should be dosed with caution in the elderly and counseled on this side effect.<ref name=":0" />

==Chemistry==
The minimum requirement for [[adrenergic agent]]s is a primary or secondary amine separated from a substituted benzene ring by one or two carbons.<ref name=":3" /> This configuration results in strong agonist activity. As the size of the substituent attached to the amine becomes greater, particularly with respect to a t-butyl group, then the molecule typically is found to have [[receptor affinity]] without intrinsic activity, and is, therefore, an antagonist.<ref name=":3">[http://pharmaxchange.info/notes/medicinal_chemistry/adrenergics_cholinergics.html Medicinal Chemistry of Adrenergics and Cholinergics]</ref> Labetalol, with its 1-methyl-3-phenylpropyl substituted amine, is greater in size relative to a t-butyl group and therefore acts predominantly as an antagonist. The overall structure of labetalol is very polar. This was created by substituting the isopropyl group in the standard beta-blocker structure with an aralkyl group, including a carboxamide group on the meta position, and by adding a hydroxyl group on the para position.<ref name=":63"/>

Labetalol has two [[chiral]] carbons and consequently exists as four [[stereoisomer]]s.<ref name="pmid1687367">{{cite journal |vauthors=Riva E, Mennini T, Latini R |title=The alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking activities of labetalol and its RR-SR (50:50) stereoisomers |journal=Br.

Labetalol acts by blocking alpha and beta [[adrenergic receptors]], resulting in decreased [[peripheral vascular resistance]] without significant alteration of [[heart rate]] or [[cardiac output]].

==Pharmacology==

=== Mechanism of Action ===
Labetalol is a dual alpha (α1) and beta (β1/β2) adrenergic receptor blocker and competes with other [[Catecholamines]] for binding to these sites.<ref name=":43" /> Its action on these receptors are potent and [[Reversible competitive antagonist|reversible]].<ref name=":12">{{Cite web|url = http://www.parpharm.com/generics/images/pdf/0122_po.pdf|title = Labetalol [package insert]. Spring Valley, NY: Par Pharmaceutical; 2011.|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}</ref> Labetalol is highly selective for [[Postsynaptic receptor|postsynaptic]] alpha1- adrenergic, and non-selective for beta-adrenergic receptors. It is about equipotent in blocking both beta1- and beta2- receptors.<ref name=":63"/>

The amount of alpha to beta blockade depends on whether labetalol is administered orally or [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]] (IV). Orally, the ratio of alpha to β blockade is 1:3. [[Intravenous therapy|Intravenously]], alpha to β blockade ratio is 1:7.<ref name=":63"/><ref name=":12" /> Thus, the labetalol can be thought to be a beta-blocker with some alpha-blocking effects.<ref name=":12" /><ref name=":43">{{Cite book|title = Adrenoceptor Antagonist Drugs IN: Basic & Clinical Pharmacology|last = Robertson|first = D|publisher = McGraw Hill Lange Medical|year = 2012|isbn = 978-0-07-176401-8|location = San Francisco|pages = 151–168|last2 = Biaggioni|first2 = I|editor-last = Katzung|editor-first = BG|edition = 12}}</ref><ref name=":92" /> By comparison, labetalol is a weaker β-blocker than [[propranolol]], and has a weaker affinity for alpha-receptors compared to [[Phentolamine]].<ref name=":63" /><ref name=":43" />

Labetalol possesses [[intrinsic sympathomimetic activity]].<ref name=":92">{{Cite book|title = Adrenoreceptor Antagonists IN: Modern Pharmacology with Clinical Applications|last = Westfall|first = David P|publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|year = 2004|isbn = 978-0781737623|location = Baltimore, MD|pages = 109–117.|editor-last = Craig|editor-first = Charles R|edition = 6th}}</ref> In particular, it is a [[partial agonist]] at beta2- receptors located in the [[Blood vessel|vascular]] [[Smooth muscle tissue|smooth muscle]]. Labetalol relaxes vascular smooth muscle by a combination of this partial beta2- agonism and through alpha1- blockade.<ref name=":92" /><ref>{{Cite journal|title = Hemodynamic effects of beta-blocking compounds possessing vasodilating activity: a review of labetalol, prizidilol, and dilevalol|journal = Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology|date = 1988-01-01|issn = 0160-2446|pmid = 2464093|pages = S12-17|volume = 11 Suppl 2|first = P.|last = Lund-Johansen|doi=10.1097/00005344-198800000-00004}}</ref> Overall, this [[Vasodilation|vasodilatory]] effect can decrease blood pressure.<ref name=":4" />

=== Physiological Action ===
The physiological effects of labetalol when administered acutely (intravenously) are not predictable solely by their receptor blocking effect, i.e. blocking beta1- receptors should decrease heart rate, but labetalol does not. When labetalol is given in acute situations, it decreases the peripheral vascular resistance and systemic blood pressure while having little effect on the heart rate, cardiac output and stroke volume, despite its alpha1-, beta1- and beta2- blocking mechanism.<ref name=":8">{{Cite journal|title = Labetalol: a review of its pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical uses and adverse effects|journal = Pharmacotherapy|date = 1983-08-01|issn = 0277-0008|pmid = 6310529|pages = 193–219|volume = 3|issue = 4|first = E.

Long term labetalol use also has different effects from other beta-blocking drugs. Other beta-blockers, such as [[propranolol]], persistently reduce cardiac output during exercise. The peripheral vascular resistance decreases when labetalol is first administered. Continuous labetalol use further decreases peripheral vascular resistance. However, during exercise, cardiac output remains the same due to a compensatory mechanism that increases [[stroke volume]]. Thus, labetalol is able to reduce heart rate during exercise while maintaining cardiac output by the increase in stroke volume.<ref name=":5" />

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Labetalol, in [[animal model]]s, was found to cross the [[blood-brain-barrier]] in only negligible amounts.<ref name="GantenMulrow2012">{{cite book|author1=Detlev Ganten|author2=Patrick J. Mulrow|title=Pharmacology of Antihypertensive Therapeutics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kVzsCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA147|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-74209-5|pages=147–}}</ref>

== History ==
Labetalol was the first drug created that combined both alpha- and beta- adrenergic receptor blocking properties. It was created to potentially fix the compensatory reflex issue that occurred when blocking a single receptor subtype, i.e. vasoconstriction after blocking beta-receptors or tachycardia after blocking alpha receptors. Because the reflex from blocking the single receptor subtypes acted to prevent the lowering of blood pressure, it was postulated that weak blocking of both alpha- and beta- receptors could work together to decrease blood pressure.<ref name=":63"/><ref name=":5" />
