'''Coricidin''', '''Coricidin 'D'''' (decongestant), or '''CoricidinHBP''' (for '''h'''igh '''b'''lood '''p'''ressure), is the name of a drug marketed by [[Schering-Plough]] that contains [[dextromethorphan]] (a [[cough suppressant]]) and [[chlorpheniramine]] maleate (an [[antihistamine]]). Varieties of Coricidin may also contain [[acetaminophen]] (an [[analgesic]]/[[antipyretic]]) and [[guaifenesin]] (an [[expectorant]]).

==Medicinal use==
Coricidin is used to alleviate coughs and includes chlorpheniramine for people with high blood pressure. Other versions of Coricidin are used to reduce fever or as an expectorant. Side effects include [[diarrhea]] and [[hallucination]].<ref>[http://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-2247/coricidin-hbp-cough-and-cold-oral/details/list-sideeffects "Coricidin HBP Cough and Cold"], WebMD. Retrieved 7 January 2017.</ref>

==Recreational use==
{{see also|Recreational use of dextromethorphan}}
Coricidin is sometimes used in high doses as a recreational drug{{cn|date=September 2017}} because it contains the [[dissociative]] [[dextromethorphan]]. In this context, Coricidin is referred to as C's, Red Devils (Red D's), Skittles, Trips,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Henigig|first=Christian}}</ref>{{full|date=September 2017}} or Triple C's.

Long-term recreational abuse of dextromethorphan can result in [[psychosis]] and [[erectile dysfunction]].<ref>[http://www.poisoncentertampa.org/poison-topics/substances-of-abuse/ "Substances of Abuse"], Florida Poison Information Center - Tampa. Retrieved 7 jan 2017</ref>

Chlorpheniramine is an [[anticholinergic]] that can cause very serious reactions in high doses.{{vague|date=September 2017}}{{citation needed|reason=This claim is not backed up by a source in any of places that it is made on this website. Further investigation shpuld be done.|date=March 2017}} This may be compounded by the fact that dextromethorphan and chlorpheniramine are both metabolized by [[CYP2D6]] isozyme of [[cytochrome P450]]. This could increase the plasma concentration of both drugs by inhibiting metabolism and increasing blood serum concentrations. Another danger is chlorpheniramine's notably long half life (about a whole day), which may result in high levels of it building up in one's body if Coricidin is abused frequently.  Symptoms of withdrawal include memory loss, weight loss, disorientation, irregular sleep schedules including to but not limited to confusion on when the former user originally fell asleep, frequent trips to the bathroom with the illusion of the need to go, increased appetite, vomiting and lack of ambition due to dependence on the euphoric feeling and increased drive that occurred while using.{{medcn|date=September 2017}}

[[File:Coricidinslides.jpg|thumb|right|Two Coricidin bottles used as guitar slides (second and third from left)]]
In the late 1960s, blues-rock guitarist [[Duane Allman]] (1946–1971) of [[The Allman Brothers Band]] began using an empty glass Coricidin bottle as a [[slide guitar|guitar slide]], finding it to be just the right size and shape for this purpose. Allman learned to play slide guitar when he received two birthday gifts from his brother, [[Gregg Allman|Gregg]]: a copy of [[Taj Mahal (album)|Taj Mahal's debut album]], with its version of "[[Statesboro Blues]]",  and a bottle of Coricidin pills (as Duane had a cold that day). Other prominent slide guitarists, such as [[Derek Trucks]] (a later member of the Allman Brothers Band), [[Ray Wylie Hubbard]], [[Rory Gallagher]], [[J. D. Simo]] and [[Gary Rossington]] also adopted the Coricidin bottle as a slide. Bottles of the type they used were not produced after the early 1980s, but replicas have been produced since 1985.<ref name="slide1">[http://www.rbnc.net/slide.html Planet Blue Productions ....Home of the Real Bottlenecking Company and the Coricidin Slide], Accessed September 11, 2005 '''''** rbnc.net may harm your computer -- 02/20/2012 **'''''</ref>{{dead  link|date=September 2017}}<ref name="slide2">[http://www.rbnc.net/duane.html Duane Allman (1946–1971)], September 11, 2005 '''''** rbnc.net may harm your computer -- 02/20/2012 **'''''</ref>{{dead  link|date=September 2017}}
