'''Alglucerase''' was a [[biopharmaceutical]] drug for the treatment of [[Gaucher's disease]].  It was a modified form of human  β-[[glucocerebrosidase]] [[enzyme]], where the non-reducing ends of the [[oligosaccharide]] chains have been terminated with [[mannose]] [[residue (chemistry)|residue]]s.<ref name=Deegan>{{cite journal | last1 = Deegan | first1 = PB | last2 = Cox | first2 = TM | year = 2012 | title = Imiglucerase in the treatment of Gaucher disease: a history and perspective | url = | journal = Drug Des Devel Ther. | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 81–106 | doi = 10.2147/DDDT.S14395 | pmid = 22563238 | pmc=3340106}}</ref>

'''Ceredase''' is the trade name of a [[citrate]] [[buffer solution|buffered solution]] of alglucerase that was manufactured by [[Genzyme Corporation]] from human [[placental]] [[biological tissue|tissue]].<ref name=Deegan/> It is given [[intravenously]] in the treatment of Type 1 Gaucher's disease.   This was the first drug appoved as an [[enzyme replacement therapy]].<ref name=Deegan/>

It was approved by the FDA in 1991.<ref>World Health Organization.
