'''Benzestrol''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]]) (brand names '''Chemestrogen''', '''Ocestrol''', '''Octestrol''', '''Octoestrol''', '''Octofollin''') is a [[Organic compound#Synthetic compounds|synthetic]], [[nonsteroidal]] [[estrogen]] of the [[stilbestrol]] group that was formerly used medically but has since been discontinued.<ref name="Elks2014">{{cite book|author=J.

==Uses==
Benzestrol and other stilbestrol were used as synthetic estrogens in order to prevent premature births.<ref name="cdc" /> Based on the idea that premature births happened because the mother did not produce enough estrogen on her own, doctors prescribed benzestrol to mothers in order to increase their estrogen levels.

Studies have been done in the past on normal, mature and castrate female rats. Benzestrol produced the same type of estrus in the castrate rat when injected at 0.8 to 1.0 micrograms as when the rat was injected with 2.0 to 2.5 micrograms of estrone.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Effects of a New Synthetic Estrogen, Benzestrol Upon the Hematopoietic System in the Rat| doi = 10.1210/endo-36-5-305 |year=1945 |last1=Stebbins |first1=R.B. |last2=Blanchard |first2=E.W. |journal=Endocrinology |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=305}}</ref>  This is significant because less benzestrol could be used to produce the same effect as estrone in increasing estrogen production.  It has been used in the past as a nonsteroidal estrogen antagonist.

==Pharmacology==
Benzestrol is described as a very powerful estrogen.<ref>{{cite book|title=Natural Products|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zb84fVthd_cC&pg=PA288|year=2006|publisher=Krishna Prakashan Media|isbn=978-81-87224-85-3|pages=288–}}</ref>

==Chemistry==
Benzestrol is usually grouped with the stilbestrol estrogens. However, benzestrol is technically not a stilbestrol derivative because its central chain is elongated by one carbon. In any case, it is a very close analogue of the stilbestrol estrogens.<ref name="Sevringhaus1944">{{cite journal|last1=Sevringhaus|first1=Elmer L.|title=Therapy of the Patient in the Menopause: Endocrine Methods|journal=The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism|volume=4|issue=12|year=1944|pages=597–604|issn=0021-972X|doi=10.1210/jcem-4-12-597}}</ref>

==History==
Benzestrol is a drug in the stilbestrol family of estrogens. These drugs were first produced in the late 1930s. Benzestrol itself was reported in 1946.<ref name="Elks2014" /> In 1953, experiments began on benzestrol and other stilbestrols to see if they actually helped stop premature births. This study in 1953 found that benzestrol did not in fact help stop premature births.<ref name="cdc" /> A study in 1971 found that benzestrol was the cause of a rare vaginal cancer in girls and women whose mothers had been on benzestrol while pregnant.<ref name="cdc" />
