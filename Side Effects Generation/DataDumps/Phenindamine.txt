'''Phenindamine''' ('''Nolahist''', '''Thephorin''') is an [[antihistamine]] and [[anticholinergic]] closely related to [[cyproheptadine]]. It was developed by [[Hoffman-La Roche]] in the late 1940s.<ref>US Patent 2546652 - Pyridindenes and process for their manufacture</ref> It is used to treat symptoms of the [[common cold]] and [[allergies]], such as sneezing, itching, rashes, and [[hives]]. Its efficacy against some symptoms of opioid withdrawal was researched in the 1950s and 1960s in a number of countries; [[William S. Burroughs]]' book ''[[Junkie (novel)|Junkie]]'' mentions this technique. Like many other first-generation antihistamines, phenindamine has useful potentiating effects on many narcotic analgesics and is even more useful with those opioids which release histamine when in the body.

Nolahist was originally manufactured in the USA by Carnrick Laboratories, and later by Amarin Pharmaceuticals. When that company ceased its American operations, its product line was acquired by [[Valeant]], but they declined to resume manufacturing Nolahist. The last produced lot bore an expiration date of 10/2005, and the product is no longer available.

Phenindamine does exhibit [[optical isomerism]] as do other chemicals of its general type ranging from [[pethidine]] and [[alphaprodine]] to [[cyproheptadine]] to certain herbacides and other industrial chemicals; the.<ref>J Pharm Sci. 1980 Mar;69(3):342-4,</ref>  In the example at hand, the compound [[isophenidamine]] (60295-96-7 MSDS), which is inactive.<ref>
