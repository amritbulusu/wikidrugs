'''Emicerfont''' ('''GW-876,008''') is a drug developed by [[GlaxoSmithKline]] which acts as a [[Corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1|CRF-1]] antagonist. Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), also known as [[Corticotropin releasing hormone]], is an endogenous peptide hormone which is released in response to various triggers such as [[chronic stress]], and activates the two [[corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor]]s: [[Corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1|CRF<sub>1</sub>]] and [[Corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 2|CRF<sub>2</sub>]]. This then triggers the release of [[Adrenocorticotropic hormone|corticotropin]] (ACTH), another hormone which is involved in the physiological response to stress.

Emicerfont blocks the CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor, and so reduces ACTH release. It has been investigated for the treatment of [[irritable bowel syndrome]] (IBS) and [[alcoholism]], and while it was not effective enough to be adopted for medical use in these applications, it continues to be used for research, as the role of the CRH-ACTH system in IBS remains poorly understood.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hubbard | first1 = CS | last2 = Labus | first2 = JS | last3 = Bueller | first3 = J | last4 = Stains | first4 = J | last5 = Suyenobu | first5 = B | last6 = Dukes | first6 = GE | last7 = Kelleher | first7 = DL | last8 = Tillisch | first8 = K | last9 = Naliboff | first9 = BD | last10 = Mayer | first10 = EA | title = Corticotropin-Releasing Factor Receptor 1 Antagonist Alters Regional Activation and Effective Connectivity in an Emotional-Arousal Circuit During Expectation of Abdominal Pain | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | date = 31 August 2011 | volume = 31 | issue = 35 | pages = 12491–500 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1860-11.2011 | pmid = 21880911  | pmc = 3399687}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Zorrilla | first1 = EP | last2 = Heilig | first2 = M | last3 = de Wit | first3 = H | last4 = Shaham | first4 = Y | title = Behavioral, Biological, and Chemical Perspectives on Targeting CRF(1) Receptor Antagonists to Treat Alcoholism | journal = Drug and Alcohol Dependence | date = 1 March 2013 | volume = 128 | issue = 3 | pages = 175–86 | doi = 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2012.12.017 | pmid = 23294766  | pmc = 3596012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Labus | first1 = JS | last2 = Hubbard | first2 = CS | last3 = Bueller | first3 = J | last4 = Ebrat | first4 = B | last5 = Tillisch | first5 = K | last6 = Chen | first6 = M | last7 = Stains | first7 = J | last8 = Dukes | first8 = GE | last9 = Kelleher | first9 = DL | last10 = Naliboff | first10 = BD | last11 = Fanselow | first11 = M | last12 = Mayer | first12 = EA | title = Impaired Emotional Learning and Involvement of the Corticotropin-Releasing Factor Signaling System in Patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome | journal = Gastroenterology | date = December 2013 | volume = 145 | issue = 6 | pages = 1253–61.e1–3 | doi = 10.1053/j.gastro.2013.08.016 | pmid = 23954313  | pmc = 4069031}}</ref>
