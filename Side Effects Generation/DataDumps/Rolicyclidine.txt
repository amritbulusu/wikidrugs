'''Rolicyclidine''' ('''PCPy''') is a [[Dissociative drug|dissociative]] [[anesthesia|anesthetic]] drug with [[hallucinogen]]ic and [[sedative]] effects. It is similar in effects to [[phencyclidine]] but is slightly less potent and has less stimulant effects <ref>Kalir A, Edery H, Pelah Z, Balderman D, Porath G. 1-Phenylcycloalkylamine derivatives. II. Synthesis and pharmacological activity. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry. 1969. 12(3):473-477</ref> instead producing a sedative effect described as being somewhat similar to a [[barbiturate]], but with additional PCP-like dissociative, anaesthetic and hallucinogenic effects.<ref>DEA Microgram Bulletin, 8, 143, 1975</ref> Due to its similarity in effects to PCP, PCPy was placed into the Schedule I list of illegal drugs in the 1970s, although it has never been widely abused and is now little known.
