'''Nimodipine''' (marketed by [[Bayer]] as '''Nimotop''') is a [[dihydropyridine]] [[calcium channel blocker]] originally developed for the treatment of [[arterial hypertension|high blood pressure]]. It is not frequently used for this indication, but has shown good results in preventing a major complication of [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]] (a form of [[cerebral hemorrhage]]) termed [[vasospasm]]; this is now the main use of nimodipine.

==Dosage==
The regular dosage is 60&nbsp;mg tablets every four hours. If the patient is unable to take tablets orally, it was previously given via [[intravenous infusion]] at a rate of 1–2&nbsp;mg/hour (lower dosage if the body weight is <70&nbsp;kg or blood pressure is too low),<ref name=Janjua>{{cite journal |author=Janjua N, Mayer SA |title=Cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage |journal=Current Opinion in Critical Care |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=113–9 |year=2003 |pmid=12657973 |doi=10.1097/00075198-200304000-00006|last2=Mayer }}</ref> but since the withdrawal of the IV preparation, administration by [[nasogastric tube]] is an alternative.

==Usage==
Because it has some selectivity for cerebral vasculature, nimodipine's main use is in the prevention of [[cerebral cortex|cerebral]] [[vasospasm]] and resultant [[ischemia]], a complication of [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]] (a form of [[cerebral hemorrhage|cerebral bleed]]), specifically from ruptured intracranial berry aneurysms irrespective of the patient's post-ictus neurological condition.<ref name=Lbl>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2006/018869s014lbl.pdf |title=FDA approved Labeling text.

If [[blood pressure]] drops by over 5%, dosage is adjusted. There is still controversy regarding the use of intravenous nimodipine on a routine basis.<ref name=Janjua/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Allen GS, Ahn HS, Preziosi TJ |title=Cerebral arterial spasm--a controlled trial of nimodipine in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=308 |issue=11 |pages=619–24 |year=1983 |pmid=6338383 |doi=10.1056/NEJM198303173081103 |displayauthors=etal  }}</ref>

A 2003 trial (Belfort ''et al.'') found nimodipine was inferior to [[magnesium sulfate]] in preventing seizures in women with severe [[preeclampsia]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Belfort MA, Anthony J, Saade GR, Allen JC |title=A comparison of magnesium sulfate and nimodipine for the prevention of eclampsia |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=348 |issue=4 |pages=304–11 |year=2003 |pmid=12540643 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa021180|last2=Anthony |last3=Saade |last4=Allen Jr |last5=Nimodipine Study }}</ref>

Nimodipine is not regularly used to treat [[head injury]]. Several investigations have been performed evaluating its use for traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage; a systematic review of 4 trials did not suggest any significant benefit to the patients that receive nimodipine therapy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Vergouwen MD, Vermeulen M, Roos YB |title=Effect of nimodipine on outcome in patients with traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage: a systematic review |journal=Lancet Neurology |volume=5 |issue=12 |pages=1029–32 |year=2006 |pmid=17110283 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(06)70582-8 |last2=Vermeulen |last3=Roos }}</ref> There was one report case of nimodipine being successfully used for treatment of ultradian bipolar cycling after brain injury and, later, amygdalohippocampectomy.<ref>{{cite journal | author = De León OA. | title = Response to nimodipine in ultradian bipolar cycling after amygdalohippocampectomy. | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 146-148 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22217956 | doi = 10.1097/JCP.0b013e31823f9116}}</ref>

== Pharmacokinetics ==

=== Absorption ===
After oral administration, it reaches peak plasma concentrations within one and a half hours. Patients taking enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants have lower plasma concentrations, while patients taking sodium valproate were markedly higher.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 1368527 | year = 1991 | author1 = Tartara | first1 = A | title = Differential effects of valproic acid and enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants on nimodipine pharmacokinetics in epileptic patients | journal = British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = 335–340 | last2 = Galimberti | first2 = C.

===Metabolism===
Nimodipine is metabolized in the [[first pass metabolism]]. The [[dihydropyridine]] ring of the nimodipine is dehydrogenated in the hepatic cells of the liver, a process governed by [[cytochrome P450]] isoform 3A ([[CYP3A]]). This can be completely inhibited however, by [[troleandomycin]] (an antibiotic) or ketoconazole (an antifungal drug).<ref>http://www.chinaphar.com/1671-4083/21/690.pdf</ref>

===Excretion===
Studies in non-human mammals using radioactive labeling have found that 40–50% of the dose is excreted via urine. The residue level in the body was never more than 1.5% in monkeys.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Mode of action==
Nimodipine binds specifically to <small>L</small>-type voltage-gated calcium channels. There are numerous theories about its mechanism in preventing vasospasm, but none are conclusive.<ref name=Rang>{{cite book |author=Rang, H. P. |title=Pharmacology |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |location=Edinburgh |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-443-07145-4 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>

Nimodipine has additionally been found to act as an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of the [[mineralocorticoid receptor]], or as an [[antimineralocorticoid]].<ref name="Luther2014">{{cite journal|last1=Luther|first1=James M.|title=Is there a new dawn for selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism?|journal=Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension|volume=23|issue=5|year=2014|pages=456–461|issn=1062-4821|doi=10.1097/MNH.0000000000000051}}</ref>

==Contraindications==
Nimodipine is associated with [[hypotension|low blood pressure]], flushing and sweating, edema, nausea and other gastrointestinal problems, most of which are known characteristics of [[calcium channel blockers]]. It is [[contraindication|contraindicated]] in [[unstable angina]] or an episode of [[myocardial infarction]] more recently than one month.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

While nimodipine was occasionally administered intravenously in the past, the FDA released an alert in January 2006 warning that it had received reports of the approved oral preparation being used intravenously, leading to severe complications; this was despite warnings on the box that this should not be done.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm129297.htm |title=Information for Healthcare Professionals: Nimodipine (marketed as Nimotop) |accessdate=2009-07-21 |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]]|work=Postmarket Drug Safety Information for Patients and Providers}}</ref>

==Side-effects==
The FDA has classified the side effects into groups based on dosages levels at q4h. For the high dosage group (90&nbsp;mg) less than 1% of the group experienced adverse conditions including itching, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, neurological deterioration, vomiting, [[diaphoresis]], [[congestive heart failure]], hyponatremia, decreasing platelet count, disseminated intravascular coagulation, deep vein [[thrombosis]].<ref name=Lbl/>

==Synthesis==
[[File:Nimodipine synthesis.svg|thumb|center|800px|[[Dihydropyridine]] [[calcium channel blocker]]. Prepn: H. Meyer et al., {{Cite patent|DE|2117571}}; eidem, {{US patent|3799934}} (1972, 1974 to [[Bayer]]).]]
The key acetoacetate ('''2''') for the synthesis of nimodipine ('''5''') is obtained by alkylation of sodium acetoacetate  with 2-methoxyethyl chloride, [[Aldol condensation]] of ''meta''-nitrobenzene ('''1''') and the subsequent reaction of the intermediate with enamine ('''4''') gives nimodipine.
