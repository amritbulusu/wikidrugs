'''Motexafin lutetium''' is a [[texaphyrin]], marketed as '''Antrin''' by Pharmacyclics Inc.

It is a photosensitiser for use in [[photodynamic therapy]] to treat skin conditions and superficial cancers.

It has also been tested for use in [[photoangioplasty]] (photodynamic treatment of diseased arteries).<ref>[http://www2.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/09-25-2002/0001806282&EDATE= Pharmacyclics Announces Final Phase 1 Results of Antrin Phototherapy For Coronary Artery Disease] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716075826/http://www2.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F09-25-2002%2F0001806282&EDATE= |date=2011-07-16 }}, 2002</ref>

It is photoactivated by 732&nbsp;nm light which allows greater depth of penetration.<ref>http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3931/is_200909/ai_n42040200/pg_9/ Porphyrin and Nonporphyrin Photosensitizers in Oncology: Preclinical and Clinical Advances in Photodynamic Therapy Photochemistry and Photobiology, Sep/Oct 2009. by O'Connor, Aisling E, Gallagher, William M, Byrne, Annette T</ref>
