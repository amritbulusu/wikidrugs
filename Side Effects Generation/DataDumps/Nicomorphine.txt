'''Nicomorphine''' ('''Vilan''', '''Subellan''', '''Gevilan''', '''MorZet''') is the 3,6-dinicotinate [[ester]] of [[morphine]].   It is a strong opioid agonist analgesic two to three times as potent as morphine with a side effect profile similar to that of [[dihydromorphine]], morphine, and [[diamorphine]].  Nicomorphine was patented as '''Vilan''' by Lannacher Heilmittel G.m.b.H. of Austria in 1957.  and was first synthesized in 1904 either there or at another firm in what was then Austria-Hungary.  The hydrochloride salt is available as ampoules of 10&nbsp;mg/ml solution for injection, 5&nbsp;mg tablets, and 10&nbsp;mg suppositories.  It is possible that other manufacturers distribute 10&nbsp;mg tablets and other concentrations of injectable nicomorphine in ampoules and multidose vials. It is used, particularly in the German-speaking countries and elsewhere in Central Europe and some other countries in Europe and the former USSR in particular, for post-operative, cancer, chronic non-malignant and other neuropathic pain.{{medical citation needed|date=May 2016}}  It is commonly used in [[patient-controlled analgesia]] (PCA) units.  The usual starting dose is 5–10&nbsp;mg given every 3–5 hours.

The 3,6-diesters of morphine are drugs with more rapid and complete central nervous system penetration due to increased lipid solubility and other structural considerations.  The prototype for this subgroup of semi-synthetic opiates is [[heroin]] and the group also includes [[dipropanoylmorphine]], [[diacetyldihydromorphine]], [[disalicylmorphine]] and others.  Whilst this produces an enhanced "bang"{{clarify|date=May 2016}} when the drug is administered intravenously, it cannot be distinguished from morphine via other routes, although the different side effect profile, including lower incidence of nausea, is very apparent.

The method for synthesis of nicomorphine, which involves treating anhydrous morphine base with nicotinic anhydride at 130&nbsp;°C, was published by Pongratz and Zirm in ''Monatshefte für Chemie'' in 1957,<ref>https://books.google.com/books?isbn=3642479855</ref> simultaneously with the two analogues [[nicocodeine]] and [[nicodicodeine]] in an article about amides and esters of various organic acids.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?isbn=3642479855</ref><ref>{{cite journal| pmid=13847637 | volume=10 | title=[On the knowledge of new amides and esters of nicotinic acid.

==Side effects==
Nicomorphine's [[side effects]] are similar to those of other [[opioids]] and include [[itching]], [[nausea]] and [[respiratory depression]].  It is considered by doctors to be one of the better analgesics for the comprehensive mitigation of suffering, as opposed to purely clouding the noxious pain stimulus, in the alleviation of chronic pain conditions.<ref>Vadon P, Rehak P. Comparison of the analgesic effect of nicomorphine in two different solutions (German). Wiener Medizinische Wochenschrift. 1979 Apr 30;129(8):217-20.</ref>

==Legality==
Nicomorphine is regulated in much the same fashion as morphine worldwide but is a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States and was never introduced there.

Nicomorphine may appear on rare occasions on the European black market and other channels for unsupervised opioid users.  It can be produced as part of a mixture of salts and derivatives of morphine by end users by means of treating morphine with nicotinic anhydride or related chemicals in an analogue of the heroin homebake process.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacokinetics===
Nicomorphine is rapidly metabolized when administered by the I.V. route, having a half-life of 3 minutes, into morphine and [[6-nicotinoylmorphine]], the secondary active metabolite.  Half lives of the metabolites were 3–15 minutes for the nicotinoyl metabolite, and 135–190 minutes for morphine.<ref name="NicoIV">{{cite journal | title=Pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered nicomorphine and its metabolites in man. | date=Mar 1, 1993 | journal=European Journal of Anesthesiology | vauthors=Koopman-Kimenai, PM, Vree TB, Booij, LH, Dirksen, R, Nijhuis, GM | volume=10 | issue=3 | location=England | pages=125–132 | pmid=8462537}}</ref>

Via the [[epidural]] route, a much slower release from epidural space occurs and nicomorphine remains detectable for 1.5 hours or so, and has a longer effect of 18.2 +/- 10.1 hours due to slower release of the active metabolites, morphine and 6-nicotinoylmorphine.  Half lives for those compounds is listed in the IV route.<ref name="NicoEpidural">{{cite journal | title=Pharmacokinetics of nicomorphine and its metabolites in man after epidural administration. (Dutch) | date=Jun 21, 1991 | journal=Pharmaceutish Weekblad. Scientific Edition. | vauthors=Koopman-Kimenai PM, Vree TB, Hasenbos MA, Weber EW, Verweij-Van Wissen CP, Booij LH | volume=13 | issue=3 | location=Netherlands | pages=142–147 | pmid=1923705 | doi=10.1007/bf01981532}}</ref>

Pharmacokinetics via the rectal route differ, and change metabolism.  Eight minutes after administration, morphine appeared rapidly, and had a half life of 1.48 +/- 0.48h.  This was in turn metabolized to morphine-3- and morphine-6-glucoranides after another 12 minutes, which had similar half-lives to one-another, at about 2.8h.  No 6-mononicotinoylmorphine was found, and bioavailability of morphine and metabolic actives was 88%.  No remaining nicomorphine was  found in urine.<ref name="NicoRectal">{{cite journal | pmid=7889023 | title=Rectal administration of nicomorphine in patients improves biological availability of morphine and its glucuronide conjugates. | publisher=The Hague : KNMP, c1993- | journal=Pharmacy and World Science : PWS | date=Dec 2, 1994 |volume=16 | issue=6 | pages=248–253 | language=English | issn=0928-1231 | vauthors=Koopman-Kimenai PM, Vree TB, Booij LH, Dirksen R}}</ref>
