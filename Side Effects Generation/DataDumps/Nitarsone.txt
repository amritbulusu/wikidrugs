'''Nitarsone''' is an [[organoarsenic compound]] that is used in [[poultry production]] as a feed additive to increase weight gain, improve [[feed conversion ratio|feed efficiency]], and prevent [[histomoniasis]] (blackhead disease).<ref>{{cite news | author = U.S. Food and Drug Administration | url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/animaldrugsatfda | title = Animal Drugs @ FDA}}</ref> It is marketed as '''Histostat''' by [[Zoetis]], a publicly traded subsidiary of [[Pfizer]].<ref>{{cite news | author = Zoetis | url = https://online.zoetis.com/US/EN/Products/Pages/Histostat.aspx | title = Histostat: Type A Medicated Feed Article}}</ref>

Nitarsone is one of four [[arsenical]] animal drugs approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] for use in poultry, along with [[roxarsone]], [[arsanilic acid]], and [[carbarsone]].<ref name=FDAQ&A>{{cite news | author = U.S. Food and Drug Administration | url = http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/SafetyHealth/ProductSafetyInformation/ucm258313.htm | title = Questions and Answers Regarding 3-Nitro (Roxarsone) | date = June 8, 2011}}</ref> Following the 2011 suspension of roxarsone sales in the United States, however, it is believed to be the only arsenical animal drug currently marketed in the U.S.<ref name=FDAQ&A /><ref>{{cite news | author = Sabrina Tavernise | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/11/health/study-finds-an-increase-in-arsenic-levels-in-chicken.html | title = Study Finds an Increase in Arsenic Levels in Chicken | publisher = [[New York Times]] | date = May 11, 2013}}</ref> In September 2013, the FDA announced that [[Zoetis]] and [[Fleming Laboratories]] would voluntarily withdraw current [[roxarsone]], [[arsanilic acid]], and [[carbarsone]] approvals, leaving only nitarsone approvals in place.<ref>{{cite news | author = U.S. Food and Drug Administration | url = http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/SafetyHealth/ProductSafetyInformation/ucm370568.htm | title = FDA Response to Citizen Petition on Arsenic-based Animal Drugs | date = September 20, 2011}}</ref> When the withdrawals occurred, nitarsone was only arsenical approved for use in [[animal agriculture|food animals]] in the U.S. In 2015 FDA withdrew the approval of using nitarsone in animal feeds.
