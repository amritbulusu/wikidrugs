'''Cinacalcet''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) is a [[medication|drug]] that acts as a [[calcimimetic]] (i.e. it mimics the action of [[calcium in biology|calcium]] on [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s) by [[allosteric]] activation of the [[calcium-sensing receptor]] that is expressed in various human organ tissues (Van Wagenen ''et al.'' (2001), U.S. Pat. 6,211,244). It is sold by [[Amgen]] under the trade name '''Sensipar''' in North America and Australia and as '''Mimpara''' in Europe. Cinacalcet is used to treat secondary [[hyperparathyroidism]] (elevated [[parathyroid hormone]] levels), a consequence of end-stage renal disease.<ref name="pmid16825031">{{cite journal | author = Torres PU | title = Cinacalcet HCl: a novel treatment for tertiary hyperparathyroidism caused by chronic kidney disease | journal = Journal of Renal Nutrition | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 253–8 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16825031 | doi = 10.1053/j.jrn.2006.04.010 }}</ref> Cinacalcet is also indicated for the treatment of hypercalcemia in patients with parathyroid carcinoma.<ref name="Sensipar for patients with parathyroid carincoma">{{cite news|url=http://www.sensipar.com/Sensipar_for_HPC.html|title=Sensipar for Parathyroid Carcinoma|year=2009|publisher=Amgen|accessdate=25 September 2009}}</ref> Cinacalcet was FDA approved in March 2004,<ref name="Sensipar (Cinacalcet) Tablets: Prescribing Information">{{cite web|title=Highlights of prescribing information|publisher=Amgen|url= http://pi.amgen.com/united_states/sensipar/sensipar_pi_hcp_english.pdf|accessdate=29 October 2014}}</ref> and was the first allosteric G protein-coupled receptor modulator to enter the pharmaceutical market.<ref name=pmid17266540>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bräuner-Osborne H, Wellendorph P, Jensen AA |title=Structure, pharmacology and therapeutic prospects of family C G-protein coupled receptors |journal=Current Drug Targets |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=169–84 |year=2007 |pmid=17266540 |url=http://www.eurekaselect.com/58496/article |doi=10.2174/138945007779315614}}</ref> In 2014, cinacalcet was 76th out of the top 100 drugs in the [[list of largest selling pharmaceutical products]].<ref>Drugs.com [http://www.drugs.com/stats/top100/sales U.S. Pharmaceutical Sales - Q4 2013], updated Feb. 2014</ref>

==Medical uses==
Cinacalcet is indicated for the treatment of [[tertiary hyperparathyroidism]] in people with chronic kidney disease on dialysis and hypercalcemia in people with [[parathyroid carcinoma]].<ref name="jones and bartlett">{{cite book|title=2014 Nurses Drug Handbook|date=2014|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning|location=Burlington, MA|isbn=978-1-284-03115-7|pages=245–6|edition=13th}}</ref> Cinacalcet can also be used to treat severe hypercalcemia in patients with [[primary hyperparathyroidism]] who are unable to undergo [[parathyroidectomy]].<ref name="Cinacalet: MedlinePlus Drug Information">{{cite web|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine|title=Cinacalcet|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a605004.html#special-dietary|accessdate=29 October 2014}}</ref>

In the treatment of tertiary hyperparathyroidism due to chronic kidney disease on dialysis it does not appear to affect mortality.<ref name=Cochrane2014/> It does decrease the need for a [[parathyroidectomy]] but caused more issues with [[hypocalcemia|low blood calcium levels]].<ref name=Cochrane2014>{{cite journal|last1=Ballinger|first1=AE|last2=Palmer|first2=SC|last3=Nistor|first3=I|last4=Craig|first4=JC|last5=Strippoli|first5=GF|title=Calcimimetics for tertiary hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease patients.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=9 December 2014|volume=12|pages=CD006254|pmid=25490118|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006254.pub2}}</ref>

===Pregnancy and lactation===
Cinacalcet has pregnancy category C in the US, meaning that adequate and well-controlled studies involving cinacalcet in pregnant women have not been done.<ref name="Sensipar (Cinacalcet) Tablets: Prescribing Information"/>

Studies have not been done in lactating women; therefore it is not known whether cinacalcet is excreted into human milk.<ref name="Sensipar (Cinacalcet) Tablets: Prescribing Information"/>

==Contraindications==
[[Hypocalcemia]] (decreased calcium levels) is a contraindication of cinacalcet. Patients who have serum calcium levels less than 7.5&nbsp;mg/dL should not be started on cinacalcet. Hypocalcemia symptoms include parathesias, myalgias, muscle cramping, tetany, and convulsions. Cinacalcet should not be administered until serum calcium levels are above 8.0&nbsp;mg/dL and/or hypocalcemia symptoms are resolved.<ref name="Sensipar (Cinacalcet) Tablets: Prescribing Information"/>

==Adverse effects==
Common side effects of cinacalcet include stomach upset, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, nausea, weakness, and chest pain.<ref name ="Cinacalet: MedlinePlus Drug Information" />

Clinical trials conducted in the United States by Amgen to determine whether the drug is safe in children were halted by the [[FDA]] in February 2013 following the death of a 14-year-old patient.<ref>{{cite news|last=Edney|first=Anna|title=Amgen Pediatric Trials of Sensipar Halted by FDA After Death|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-02-26/amgen-pediatric-trials-of-sensipar-halted-by-fda-after-death|newspaper=Businessweek|date=February 26, 2013}}</ref>

==Overdose==
Serious side effects, including overdose symptoms, of cinacalcet include:<ref name ="Cinacalet: MedlinePlus Drug Information" />
* burning
* tingling
* unusual feelings of the lips, tongue, fingers, or feet
* muscle aches or cramps
* sudden tightening of muscles in hands, feet, face, or throat
* seizures

==Interactions==
Cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of the liver enzyme [[CYP2D6]] and is partially metabolized by [[CYP3A4]] and [[CYP1A2]]. Dose adjustments may be necessary if patients are treated with CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 inhibitors and medications that are metabolized by CYP2D6.<ref name="Sensipar (Cinacalcet) Tablets: Prescribing Information"/>

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===
Cinacalcet is a drug that acts as a [[calcimimetic]] (i.e. it mimics the action of calcium on tissues) by [[allosteric activation]] of the [[calcium-sensing receptor]] that is expressed in various human organ tissues. The calcium-sensing receptors on the surface of the chief cell of the [[parathyroid gland]] is the principal negative regulator of parathyroid hormone secretion.<ref>http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01012</ref> Cinacalcet increases the sensitivity of calcium receptors on parathyroid cells to reduce parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and thus decrease serum calcium levels.<ref name="jones and bartlett" />

The intravenously administered drug [[etelcalcetide]] has the same mechanism of action.<ref name=amgen>[http://www.amgen.com/media/media_pr_detail.jsp?year=2015&releaseID=2081807 "Amgen Submits New Drug Application For Novel Intravenous Calcimimetic Etelcalcetide (AMG 416)”]</ref>
