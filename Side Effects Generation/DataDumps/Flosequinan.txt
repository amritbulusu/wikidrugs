'''Flosequinan''' is a [[quinolone]] [[vasodilator]] that was discovered and developed by [[Boots UK]] and was sold for about a year under the trade name Manoplax. It had been approved in 1992 in the US and UK to treat people with [[heart failure]] who could not tolerate ACE inhibitors or digitalis.<ref name=Independent>{{cite news|last1=Hosking|first1=Patrick|title=Manoplax: from heart to heartbreak: With millions lost on its 'wonder|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/manoplax-from-heart-to-heartbreak-with-millions-lost-on-its-wonder-drug-patrick-hosking-asks-whether-1487095.html|work=The Independent|date=25 July 1993}}</ref>

Boots initiated a clinical trial called PROFILE to see if the drug could be useful in a wider population. The study was terminated early in 1993 due to increased mortality in the drug arm of the trial; preliminary results were published in a conference abstract by the PI [[Milton Packer]] and others, which promised data and analysis would be forthcoming in a future paper, but as of 2001 no such paper had been published.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=van Veldhuisen|first1=DJ|last2=Poole-Wilson|first2=PA|title=The underreporting of results and possible mechanisms of 'negative' drug trials in patients with chronic heart failure.|journal=International journal of cardiology|date=August 2001|volume=80|issue=1|pages=19-27|pmid=11532543}}</ref>

Boots withdrew it from the market in July 1993.<ref name=Independent/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Associated Press|title=Heart Failure Drug Manoplax Taken Off Market|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1993/Heart-Failure-Drug-Manoplax-Taken-Off-Market/id-41d97c60a47c8e296bb592d042586dc2|work=AP News Archive|date=July 19, 1993}}</ref>
