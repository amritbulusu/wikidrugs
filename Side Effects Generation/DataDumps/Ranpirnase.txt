'''Ranpirnase''' is a [[ribonuclease]] [[enzyme]] found in the [[oocytes]] of the [[Northern Leopard Frog]] (''Rana pipiens''). Ranpirnase is a member of the [[pancreatic ribonuclease]] (RNase A) protein superfamily and degrades [[RNA]] [[substrate (chemistry)|substrates]] with a [[RNA sequence|sequence]] preference for [[uracil]] and [[guanine]] [[nucleotide]]s. Along with [[amphinase]], another leopard frog ribonuclease, ranpirnase has been studied as a potential [[cancer]] treatment due to its unusual mechanism of [[cytotoxicity]] tested against [[tumor]] cells.<ref name="ardelt">{{Cite journal

Ranpirnase was originally discovered by scientists at [[TamirBio]], a [[biotechnology]] company (formerly Alfacell Corporation), where it was tested in preclinical assays<ref>Darzynkiewicz Z, Carter SP, Mikulski SM, Ardelt WJ, Shogen K.

The [[mechanism of action]] of ranpirnase tumor-selective cytotoxicity has been attributed to the [[RNA interference]] pathway, potentially through cleaving [[siRNA]] molecules;<ref name="zhao">{{Cite journal
