'''Janssen Pharmaceutica''' is a [[pharmaceutical company]] headquartered in [[Beerse]], [[Belgium]]. It was founded in 1953 by [[Paul Janssen]].

In 1961, Janssen Pharmaceutica was purchased by [[New Jersey]]-based American corporation [[Johnson & Johnson]], and became part of [[Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development]] (J&J PRD), now renamed to Janssen Research and Development (JRD), which conducts research and development activities related to a wide range of human medical disorders, including [[mental illness]], [[Neurology|neurological disorders]], [[Anesthesia|anaesthesia]] and [[Analgesic|analgesia]], [[gastrointestinal disorder]]s, fungal infection, [[HIV/AIDS]], [[Allergy|allergies]] and [[cancer]]. Janssen and [[Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical]] have been placed in the [[Ortho-McNeil-Janssen]] group within Johnson & Johnson.

==History==
The early roots of what would become Janssen Pharmaceutica date back to 1933. In 1933, [[Constant Janssen]], the father of Paul Janssen, acquired the right to distribute the pharmaceutical products of [[Gedeon Richter Ltd.|Richter]], a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] pharmaceutical company, for Belgium, the [[Netherlands]], and [[Belgian Congo]]. On 23 October 1934, he founded the ''N.V. Produkten Richter'' in [[Turnhout]]. In 1937, Constant Janssen acquired an old factory building in the ''Statiestraat 78'' in [[Turnhout]] for his growing company, which he expanded during [[World War II]] into a four-storey building. Still a student, Paul Janssen assisted in the development of [[paracetamol]] (USP: acetaminophen, often referred to generically under the trademark [[Tylenol]]) under the name [[Perdolan]], which would later become well-known . After the war, the name for the company products was changed to ''Eupharma'', although the company name ''Richter'' would remain until 1956.<ref name=JanssenHist>{{cite journal|last1=Lopez-Munoz|first1=Francisco|last2=Alamo|first2=Cecilio|title=The Consolidation of Neuroleptic Therapy: Janssen, the Discovery of Haloperidol and Its Introduction into Clinical Practice|journal=Brain Research Bulletin|date=2009|volume=79|pages=130–141|pmid= 19186209|doi=10.1016/j.brainresbull.2009.01.005}}</ref>

Paul Janssen founded his own research laboratory in 1953 on the third floor of the building in the ''Statiestraat'', still within the ''Richter-Eurpharma'' company of his father. In 1955, he and his team developed their first drug: Neomeritine ([[ambucetamide]]), an antispasmodic found to be particularly effective for the relief of menstrual pain. On 5 April 1956, the name of the company was changed to ''NV Laboratoria Pharmaceutica C. Janssen'' (named after Constant Janssen). On 27 April 1957, the company opened a new research facility in Beerse, but the move to Beerse would not be completed until 1971-1972. On 2 May 1958, the research department in Beerse became a separate legal entity, the ''N.V. Research Laboratorium C. Janssen''.

On 24 October 1961, the company was acquired by the American corporation [[Johnson & Johnson]]. The negotiations with Johnson & Johnson were led by [[Frans Van den Bergh]], head of the Board of Directors. On 10 February 1964, the name was changed to ''Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V.'' and the seat of the company in Turnhout was also transferred to Beerse. The company was led by Paul Janssen, [[Bob Stouthuysen]] and Frans Van Den Bergh. When, in 1971-1972 the pharmaceutical production also moved to Beerse, the move from Turnhout was completed. Between 1990 and 2004, Janssen Pharmaceutica expanded worldwide, and the company grew in size to about 28000 employees worldwide.

From the beginning, Janssen Pharmaceutica emphasized as its core activity research for the development of new drugs. The research department which was established in Beerse in 1957, developed into a large research campus. In 1987, the Janssen Research Foundation (JRF) was founded which performs research into new drugs at Beerse and in other laboratories around the globe. Janssen Pharmaceutica became the Flemish company with the largest budget for research and development. Beside the headquarters in Beerse with its research departments, pharmaceutical production and the administrative departments, Janssen Pharmaceutica in Belgium still has offices in [[Berchem]] ([[Janssen-Cilag]]), a chemical factory in [[Geel]], and [[Janssen Biotech]] in [[Olen, Belgium|Olen]].

The Chemical Production plant in Geel makes the [[active ingredient]]s for the company’s medicines. In 1975, the first plant of a new chemical factory ''Plant I'' was established in Geel, ''Plant II'' was opened in 1977, ''Plant III''' in 1984, and ''Plant IV'' in 1995.  In 1999 the remaining chemical production in Beerse was transferred to Geel. About 80% of its active components are manufactured here. The site in Geel also manufactures about two-thirds of the worldwide chemical production of the pharmaceutical sector of [[Johnson & Johnson]]. In 1995, the ''Center for Molecular Design'' (CMD) was founded by Paul Janssen and [[Paul Lewi]].

In 1999, clinical research and non-clinical development become a global organization within Johnson & Johnson. In 2001, part of the research activities was transferred to the United States with the reorganization of research activities in the ''Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Development'' (JJPRD) organization. The research activities of the ''Janssen Research Foundation'' (JRF) and the ''R.W. Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute'' (PRI) (United States) were merged into the new global research organization. A new building for pharmaceutical development was completed in Beerse in 2001. In 2002, a new logistics and informatics centre was opened at a new site, ''Beerse 2''. In 2003 two new research buildings were constructed, the ''Discovery Research Center'' (DRC), and the ''Drug Safety Evaluation Center'' (DSEC). On 27 October 2004, the ''Paul Janssen Research Center'', for discovery research, was inaugurated.

The success of Janssen Pharmaceutica is commonly attributed to the vision of its founder, who himself was a brilliant scientist, but was also surrounded by talented and motivated employees, both scientifically and commercially. Paul Janssen created an environment which stimulated the creativity of his research workers.<ref>Lewi, Paul J., Successful Pharmaceutical Discovery: Paul Janssen's Concept of Drug Research, R&D Management, Vol. 37, Issue 4, pp. 355-362, September 2007</ref>

In March 2015, Janssen licensed [[tipifarnib]] (a [[farnesyl transferase]] inhibitor) to [[Kura Oncology]] who will assume sole responsibility for developing and commercialising the anti-cancer drug.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/kura-oncology-licenses-janssen-s-tipofarnib-in-cancer/81251026/|title=GEN - News Highlights:Kura Oncology Licenses Janssen's Tipofarnib in Cancer|work=GEN}}</ref> Later in the same month the company announced that [[Galapagos Pharma]] and regained the rights to the anti-inflammatory drug candidate [[GLPG1690]] as well as two other compounds including [[GLPG1205]] (a first-in-class inhibitor of [[GPR84]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/galapagos-regains-rights-to-glpg1690-from-janssen/81251040/|title=GEN - News Highlights:Galapagos Regains Rights to GLPG1690 from Janssen|work=GEN}}</ref>

In May 2016, the company launched a collaboration [[MacroGenics]] and their preclinical cancer treatment, MGD015. The deal could net MacroGenics more than $740 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/janssen-macrogenics-launch-up-to-740m-second-collaboration/81252739/|title=Janssen, MacroGenics Launch Up-to-$740M+ Second Collaboration|work=GEN}}</ref>

In September 2017 it was announced that Janssen teamed up with the [[Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority]] (BARDA), a unit of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], to create pandemic [[Influenza vaccine|flu vaccines]]. BARDA is giving Janssen $43 million in the first year and $273 million over five years for the contract. One of the projects in the contract is the development of a universal flu vaccine. The intent of the vaccine would be to protect people against all or most flu strains.<ref>http://www.fiercepharma.com/vaccines/j-j-barda-partner-up-to-advance-pandemic-flu-preparedness</ref>

===In China===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}
[[File:Xian janssen pharmaceutical01.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Xi'an]]-Janssen]]
Janssen Pharmaceutica was the first Western pharmaceutical company to set up a pharmaceutical factory in the [[People's Republic of China]].

In 1976, Paul Janssen met [[Ma Haide]] (born George Shafik Hatem), a Lebanese-American doctor who had started working in China in 1933. After three days of meetings, the two agreed to bring a modernized pharmaceutical business to China.  When [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China|Chairman]] [[Deng Xiaoping]] opened China to the West in 1978, Janssen Pharmaceutica sent [[Paul Appermont]] and [[Joos Horsten]] to set up the project.

In 1983, Janssen signed a cooperation contract to modernize production in an old  chemical factory in the city of [[Hanzhong]], in [[Shaanxi]] province.  This factory would soon produce the active compound of some Janssen products, such as [[mebendazole]].  In 1985, now operating as Xian-Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a new large factory was opened in the city of [[Xi'an]], also in Shaanxi province.

==Controversies==
Juries in several US states have found that Janssen Pharmaceutical and its parent company Johnson & Johnson deceptively promoted the antipsychotic drug [[Risperdal]] (risperidone). By 2012, four states had been awarded damages, including Louisiana ($258 million in 2010), South Carolina ($327 million in 2011), Texas ($158 million in 2012), and most notably Arkansas ($1.2 billion in 2012) - whose Attorney General stated: “These two companies put profits before people, and they are rightfully being held responsible for their actions".<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/12/business/drug-giant-is-fined-1-2-billion-in-arkansas.html?_r=0 J.&J.

In a related issue, Risperdal sales practices resulted in a 2012 provisional settlement totaling $2.3 billion.<ref name=SalesProbe>[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-11/j-j-said-to-pay-2-2-billion-to-end-risperdal-sales-probe.html J&J Said to Agree to $2.2 Billion Drug Marketing Accord] Bloomberg News.

A settlement was provisionally agreed with Johnson & Johnson of around $2.2 billion for this and related allegations, with Omnicare having already settled for around $100 million.<ref name=SalesProbe/>  Former head of sales and president of Janssen, [[Alex Gorsky]], who the Dept of Justice say “was actively involved” in the fraud, nevertheless become the new CEO of Johnson & Johnson in 2012.<ref>[https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikakelton/2012/04/17/new-jj-ceos-ties-to-fraud-case-show-jj-sees-no-need-for-a-cure/ J&J needs a cure: new CEO allegedly had links to fraud] Forbes,  Erika Kelton, 4/17/2012</ref>
