'''Benorterone''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]) (developmental code names '''SKF-7690''', '''FC-612'''), also known as '''17α-methyl-B-nortestosterone''', is a [[steroid]]al, pure [[antiandrogen]] that was never marketed.<ref name="Elks2014">{{cite book |author=J.

In the late sixties benorterone was reported to give promising results in 93 androgenized women but was soon withdrawn from clinical trial, mainly because of the development of gynaecomastia in the male. As a big advantage compared with CPA, it was found to be effective not only orally but also topically. Free cyproterone, on the other hand, proved to be without clinical value for reasons that cannot be discussed here. Thus we are left with CPA as the only anti-androgen that is already on the market in several countries.}}</ref> The drug was found to be effective in the treatment of [[acne]], [[seborrhea]], and [[hirsutism]] in women,<ref name="HughesHasan2013" /><ref name="ZarateMahesh1966">{{cite journal |last1=Zarate |first1=A. |last2=Mahesh |first2=V.
