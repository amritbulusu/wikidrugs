'''Entacapone''', sold under the brand name '''Comtan''' among others, is a medication commonly used in combination with other medications for the treatment of [[Parkinson's disease]].<ref name=":02">{{Cite web|url = https://www.pharma.us.novartis.com/product/pi/pdf/comtan.pdf|title = Comtan Full Prescribing Information-Novartis|date = July 2014|accessdate = 4 November 2015|website = Pharma.us.novartis.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> Entacapone together with [[levodopa]] and [[carbidopa]] allows levodopa to have a longer effect in the brain and reduces Parkinson’s disease [[Parkinson's disease#Signs and symptoms|signs and symptoms]] for a greater length of time than levodopa and carbidopa therapy alone.<ref name=":02" />

Entacapone is a selective and [[reversible inhibitor]] of the enzyme [[Catechol-O-methyl transferase|catechol-''O''-methyltransferase]] (COMT).<ref name=":02" /> When taken together with levodopa (<small>L</small>-DOPA) and carbidopa, entacapone stops catechol-''O''-methyltransferase from breaking down and [[metabolizing]] levodopa, resulting in an overall increase of levodopa remaining in the brain and body.<ref name=":02" />

[[Carbidopa/levodopa/entacapone]] (Stalevo), a medication developed by [[Orion Pharma]] and marketed by [[Novartis]], is a single tablet [[Formulation#Pharmacy|formulation]] that contains levodopa, carbidopa, and entacapone.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.pharma.us.novartis.com/product/pi/pdf/stalevo.pdf|title = Stalevo Prescribing Information|date = |accessdate = 4 November 2015|website = Novartis|publisher = Novartis Pharmaceuticals|last = |first = }}</ref>

== Medical uses ==
Entacapone is used [[Adjunct therapy|in addition to]] levodopa and carbidopa for people with Parkinson's disease to treat the signs and symptoms of end-of-dose "wearing-off."<ref name=":3" /> "Wearing-off" is characterized by the re-appearance of both [[Parkinson's disease#Motor|motor]] and [[Parkinson's disease#Neuropsychiatric|non-motor]] symptoms of Parkinson’s disease occurring towards the end of a previous levodopa and carbidopa dose.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Pahwa|first=R|date=April 2009|title=Levodopa-related wearing-off in Parkinson's disease: Identification and Management|url=|journal=Current Medical Research and Opinion|volume=25|pages=841–9|doi=10.1185/03007990902779319|pmid=19228103}}<!--|access-date = 3 November 2015--></ref> In clinical trials, entacapone has not been shown to slow progression or reverse Parkinson’s disease.<ref name=":02" /><ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" />

=== Pregnancy and breastfeeding ===
[[Pregnancy category|Pregnancy category C]]: risk is not ruled out.<ref name=":02" />

Although there have been animal studies that showed that entacapone was [[excreted]] into maternal rat milk, there have been no studies with [[Breast milk|human breast milk]]. Caution is advised for mothers taking entacapone while breastfeeding or during pregnancy.<ref name=":02" />

=== Children ===
Entacapone safety and efficacy have not been assessed in [[infant]]s or children.<ref name=":02" />

=== Liver problems ===
[[Bile duct|Biliary]] excretion is the major route of [[excretion]] for entacapone. People with liver dysfunction may require additional caution and more frequent liver function monitoring while taking entacapone.<ref name=":02" />

===Kidney problems===
There are no significant considerations for people with poor kidney function taking entacapone.<ref name=":02" />

== Contraindications ==
There is a high risk for allergic reactions for people who are hypersensitive to entacapone.<ref name=":02" />

Potential limiting conditions to consider before starting entacapone include:<ref name=":2" />
* History of [[allergic reaction]] to entacapone 
* History of [[liver disease]], [[liver dysfunction]], or [[alcoholism]]
* Current or planned [[pregnancy]]
* Current or planned [[Surgery|surgeries]]

== Side effects ==
The following [[Adverse effects|side effects]] have been reported by people with Parkinson's disease treated with entacapone:
* Abdominal pain
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Fatigue
* Dry mouth
* Back ache

=== Movement problems ===
The most common side effect of entacapone is movement problems, which occur in 25% of people taking entacapone.<ref name=":02" /> This drug may cause or worsen [[dyskinesia]] for people with Parkinson's disease treated together with levodopa and carbidopa.<ref name=":02" /> In particular, "[[Levodopa-induced dyskinesia|peak-dose dyskinesias]]" may occur when levodopa levels are at its [[Cmax (pharmacology)|peak concentration]] in the [[Blood plasma|serum plasma]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.guideline.gov/content.aspx?id=34900&search=parkinson%27s+disease|title = Late (complicated) Parkinson's Disease|date = November 2006|accessdate = 3 November 2015|website = National Guideline Clearing House|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Salat|first=David|date=1 January 2013|title=Levodopa in the Treatment of Parkinson's Disease: Current Status and New Developments|url=|journal=Journal of Parkinson's Disease|volume=3|pages=255–69|doi=10.3233/JPD-130186|pmid=23948989}}<!--|access-date = 3 November 2015--></ref>

=== Diarrhea ===
10% of patients taking entacapone have been shown to experience [[diarrhea]].<ref name=":02" /> Diarrhea may occur within 4–12 weeks of initial entacapone use but resolves after discontinuation of the drug. Use of entacapone in the presence of diarrhea can also be associated with [[Dieting#How the body eliminates fat|weight loss]], low [[potassium]] levels, and [[dehydration]].<ref name=":02" /> In clinical studies, severe diarrhea was the most common reason for discontinuation of entacapone.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title = Koda-Kimble & Young's Applied Therapeutics: The Clinical Use of Drugs|last = Koda-Kimble|first = Mary Anne|publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|year = 2013|isbn = 978-1609137137|location = Philadelphia|pages = 1373–1374}}</ref>

=== Urine color ===
10% of people taking entacapone experience a change in urine color to orange, red, brown, or black. This side effect is due to entacapone metabolism and excretion in the urine and shown to not be harmful.<ref name=":1" />

=== Sudden sleep onset ===
People have reported [[Sleep onset|sudden sleep onset]] while engaging in daily activities without prior warning of drowsiness. In controlled studies, patients on entacapone had a 2% increased risk of [[somnolence]] compared to [[placebo]].<ref name=":02" />

=== Low blood pressure ===
Episodes of [[orthostatic hypotension]] have been shown to be more common at the start of entacapone use due to increased levels of levodopa.<ref name=":02" />

=== Behavior problems===
[[Postmarketing surveillance|Post-marketing data]] shows that entacapone may change or worsen [[Mental status changes|mental status]], leading to behaviors such as [[delusion]]s, agitation, confusion, and [[delirium]].<ref name=":02" />

People taking entacapone may experience increased urges to participate in gambling, sexual activities, money spending, and other stimulating reward behaviors.<ref name=":02" />

== Interactions ==
In studies, entacapone has shown a low potential for interaction with other drugs. In theory, it could interact with [[MAO inhibitor]]s, [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s and [[noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor]]s because they also increase [[catecholamine]] levels in the body, with drugs being metabolized by COMT (for example  [[methyldopa]], [[dobutamine]], [[apomorphine]], [[adrenaline]], and [[isoprenaline]]), with iron because it could form [[chelate]]s, with substances binding to the same [[albumin]] site in the blood plasma (for example [[diazepam]] and [[ibuprofen]]), and with drugs being metabolized by the liver enzyme [[CYP2C9]] (for example [[warfarin]]). None of the medications tested in studies have shown clinically relevant interactions, except perhaps warfarin for which a 13% ([[confidence interval|CI<sub>90</sub>]]: 6–19%) increase in [[International normalized ratio|INR]] was seen when combined with entacapone.<ref name="EMA" />

== Pharmacology ==

===Mechanism of action===
Entacapone is a selective and reversible [[COMT inhibitor|inhibitor of catechol-''O''-methyltransferase]] (COMT).<ref name=":02" /> COMT eliminates biologically active [[catechol]]s present in [[catecholamine]]s ([[dopamine]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[epinephrine]]) and their [[Hydroxylation|hydroxylated]] [[metabolite]]s. When administered with a [[decarboxylase inhibitor]], COMT acts as the major metabolizing enzyme for levodopa and metabolizes it to [[3-O-Methyldopa|3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-<small>L</small>-phenylalanine]] (3-OMD) in the brain and in the [[Peripheral vascular system|periphery]].<ref name=":02" />

For the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, entacapone is given as an adjunct to levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, [[carbidopa]]. Entacapone inhibits COMT in the periphery (but not, or at most marginally, in the brain<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile">{{cite book|title=Arzneistoff-Profile|editor1=Dinnendahl, V |editor2=Fricke, U |publisher=Govi Pharmazeutischer Verlag|location=Eschborn, Germany|date=2000|edition=16|volume=4|isbn=978-3-7741-9846-3|language=German}}</ref>) and the metabolism of levodopa, thus increasing plasma levels of levodopa and causing more constant dopaminergic stimulation in order to reduce the [[Signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease|signs and symptoms]] presented in the disease.<ref name=":02" />

=== Pharmacokinetics ===

==== Absorption ====
The time to highest blood plasma concentrations is approximately one hour. The substance undergoes extensive [[first-pass metabolism]]. Absolute oral [[bioavailability]] (''F'') is 35%.<ref name=":02" /><ref name="EMA">{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Product_Information/human/000171/WC500033079.pdf|title=Comtan: EPAR – Product Information|publisher=[[European Medicines Agency]]|date=10 March 2015}}</ref>

==== Distribution ====
The [[volume of distribution]]  (V<sub>d</sub>) after [[intravenous injection]] is approximately 20 liters. 98% of the circulating entacapone is bound to serum [[Human serum albumin|albumin]], which limits its [[Distribution (pharmacology)|distribution]] into [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]].<ref name=":02" /><ref name="EMA" />

==== Metabolism and elimination ====
Entacapone is primarily metabolized to its [[glucuronide]] in the liver, and 5% are converted into the [[E-Z notation|''Z''-isomer]].<ref name="EMA" /> It has a [[Biological half-life|half-life]] of approximately 0.3–0.7 hours, with only 0.2% being excreted unchanged in the urine.<ref name=":02" />
