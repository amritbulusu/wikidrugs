'''Amylin Pharmaceuticals''' was a biopharmaceutical company based in [[San Diego]], CA, that was founded in 1987. The company was engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of drug candidates for the treatment of [[diabetes]], [[obesity]] and other diseases. Amylin produced three drugs: Symlin ([[pramlintide acetate]]), Byetta ([[exenatide]]) and Bydureon (exenatide extended-release).

== History ==

=== 1987-1992: Founding and IPO ===
In 1987, Amylin Pharmaceuticals was co-founded by Howard E. Greene Jr., former CEO of San Diego biotech pioneer [[Hybritech|Hybridtech]], to develop a treatment for [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] from a synthetic analog of [[amylin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://people.equilar.com/bio/howard-greene-tandem-diabetes/salary/544437#.WSiDeusrJaQ|title=Howard E. Greene Jr. - Executive Bio, Compensation History, and Contacts - Equilar Atlas|website=people.equilar.com|access-date=2017-05-26}}</ref>  Amylin was discovered by researchers at Oxford University earlier that year.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/amylin-pharmaceuticals-inc-history/|title=History of Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. – FundingUniverse|website=www.fundinguniverse.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-26}}</ref>  Greene served as CEO from 1987 to 1996.  Amylin completed its IPO in 1992.

=== 1992 - 1998: Invention of Pramlintide & Partnership with Johnson & Johnson ===
Amylin in its natural form is sticky—it clumps on needles and forms little rocks in the pancreas. Researchers first had to create a synthetic version that they could work with more easily and reliably. The inventors at Amylin Pharmaceuticals—Laura Gaeta, Howard Jones and Elisabeth Albrecht—altered amino acids in the molecule and created a new drug named Pramlintide.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/17/business/patents-presenting-amylin-which-being-called-first-new-diabetes-drug-since.html|title=Patents; Presenting amylin, which is being called the first new diabetes drug since the discovery of insulin.|last=Chartrand|first=Sabra|date=1997-11-17|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-26|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>  In 1995, Amylin Pharmactietucals signed an agreement with [[Johnson & Johnson]]'s [[LifeScan]] division to further develop Pramlintide.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/22/business/amylin-gets-johnson-deal-and-ends-one-with-glaxo.html|title=Amylin Gets Johnson Deal And Ends One With Glaxo|last=Fisher|first=Lawrence M.|date=1995-06-22|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-26|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>  A Phase II study made public in January 1997 showed pramlintide was safe to mix with leading short-acting and intermediate-acting commercial insulin products, with preliminary results suggesting it might improve glucose control.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/global/2000/0724/0314094a.html|title=Roller Coasting|last=Moukheiber|first=Zina|date=2000-07-24|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-05-26|language=en}}</ref>  Initial Phase III trial results released in August 1997 showed Pramlintide did show statistically significant results for [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 (juvenile-onset) diabetes]], helping modestly to improve glucose control without increasing the risk of [[hypoglycemia]] (low blood sugar) while also improving weight and cholesterol levels. But [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|adult-onset type 2 diabetes]] affects far more people than type 1, and pramlintide showed significant benefits only at 6 months but not after 12 months.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fool.com/dtrouble/1998/dtrouble980320.htm|title=The Motley Fool, 3/20/98: The Daily Trouble|website=www.fool.com|access-date=2017-05-26}}</ref>  In March 1998, seven months before the next trial data were due, J&J discontinued its partnership with Amylin.

===  1998 - 2005: New Leadership, Struggle to Launch Pramlintide (SYMLIN), Development of Byetta (Exenatide) ===
Joseph C. Cook, Jr., a 28-year veteran at Eli Lilly & Co. and an Amylin board member since 1994, came out of retirement in 1998 to help the company recover its footing, taking the title of chief executive officer.  Cook reduced the company's workforce by 75 percent to conserve cash and raised capital from investors to keep SYMLIN (pramlintide's commercial name) moving through the regulatory pipeline.<ref name=":0" />

==== SYMLIN (Pramlintide) ====
In October 2001, Amylin received an approvable letter for SYMLIN from the FDA, requiring additional clinical data addressing concerns of severe hypoglcemia in type 1 diabetics for approval.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/amylin-to-take-symlin-back-to-clinic|title=Amylin to take Symlin back to clinic - Pharmaceutical industry news|last=Letter|first=The Pharma|website=www.thepharmaletter.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-26}}</ref>  In December 2003, the FDA issued a second approvable letter requesting further clinical data to identify a patient population and method of use for Symlin where there is no increased risk of significant hypoglycemia or where there is an added benefit that clearly counterbalances any potential for increases in episodes of hypoglycemia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/amylin-s-symlin-us-approval-on-hold|title=Amylin's Symlin US approval on hold - Pharmaceutical industry news|last=Letter|first=The Pharma|website=www.thepharmaletter.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-26}}</ref>  In March 2005, SYMLIN was approved by the FDA for use in diabetics who have difficulty maintaining glycemic control.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/endocrinology/diabetes/741|title=FDA Approves Symlin for Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes|date=2005-03-18|access-date=2017-05-26|language=en}}</ref>

==== Byetta (Exenatide) ====
In October 1996, Dr. John Eng licensed his discovery, exendin-4 to Amylin.  Dr. Eng discovered exendin-4 in the venum of a [[Gila monster]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=http://www.diabetesincontrol.com/dr-john-engs-research-found-that-the-saliva-of-the-gila-monster-contains-a-hormone-that-treats-diabetes-better-than-any-other-medicine/|title=Dr. John Eng's Research Found That The Saliva Of The Gila Monster Contains A Hormone That Treats Diabetes Better Than Any Other Medicine.|date=2007-09-18|work=Diabetes In Control. A free weekly diabetes newsletter for Medical Professionals.|access-date=2017-05-26|language=en-US}}</ref>  Exendin-4 is similar to the human gut hormone [[GLP-1]], which is responsible for regulating [[insulin]] and [[glucagon]] release.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Garber|first=Alan J.|date=2011-05-01|title=Long-Acting Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 Receptor Agonists|url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/34/Supplement_2/S279|journal=Diabetes Care|language=en|volume=34|issue=Supplement 2|pages=S279–S284|doi=10.2337/dc11-s231|issn=0149-5992|pmc=3632193|pmid=21525469}}</ref>  Unlike human GLP-1, however, exendin-4 doesn’t degrade for hours, making it a much better candidate for a drug.<ref name=":1" />  Amylin developed exenatide, a synthetic version of exendin-4.  In 2002, Eli Lilly signed an agreement with Amylin for $325 million to partner in development of exenatide.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/sep/21/business/fi-nudiabetes21|title=Eli Lilly to Join Forces With Amylin|last=GELLENE|first=DENISE|date=2002-09-21|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-05-26|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref>  In May 2005, Byetta (commercial name for exenatide) was approved in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.fdanews.com/articles/72196-diabetes-drug-byetta-gets-fda-approval|title=Diabetes Drug Byetta Gets FDA Approval|access-date=2017-05-26}}</ref>

=== 2005 - 2009: Development of Bydureon, Proxy Battle ===

=== 2011 - 2012: End of collaboration with Eli Lilly and Acquisition ===
In July 2012, [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] announced it would acquire Amylin Pharmaceuticals for $5.3 billion.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-30/bristol-myers-to-acquire-diabetes-maker-amylin-for-5-3-billion.html|title=Bristol’s Amylin Deal Heralds Acquisition Hunger|author=Shannon Pettypiece|work=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=21 February 2015|date=3 July 2012}}</ref>  As part of the acquisition, [[AstraZeneca]] made a $3.4 billion cash payment to make Amylin a wholly owned subsidiary within the existing BMS/AZ joint venture in diabetes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/bristol-myers-and-astrazeneca-in-7-billion-deal-for-amylin/?_r=0|title=Bristol-Myers in Deal for Amylin Valued at $7 Billion|last=Pollack|first=Michael J. de la Merced and Andrew|work=DealBook|access-date=2017-05-25|language=en}}</ref>  In April 2013, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced it would close Amylin's San Diego operations by the end of 2014 and merge the Amylin manufacutring facility in West Chester, Ohio and all field-based sales personnel into Bristol-Myers Squibb operations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/biotech/sdut-amylin-closing-bristol-myers-san-diego-2013apr03-story.html|title=Amylin's San Diego operations closing|last=Fikes|first=Bradley J.|work=sandiegouniontribune.com|access-date=2017-05-25|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sdbj.com/news/2013/apr/04/amylin-pharmaceuticals-be-closed/|title=Amylin Pharmaceuticals to Be Closed {{!}} San Diego Business Journal|website=www.sdbj.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-25}}</ref>
