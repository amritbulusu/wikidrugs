Headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark, Lundbeck has international production facilities in Denmark, Italy and France and affiliates or sales offices in 57 countries. Lundbeck employs around 5.500 people globally (as of 2013), and the company’s products are registered in more than 100 countries worldwide.<ref name="lundbeck.com"/>

In 2013, the company's [[revenue]] was DKK 15.2 billion (€2.04 billion).

Lundbeck is listed on the [[Copenhagen Stock Exchange]] (CSE).

Lundbeck is a full member of the [[European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations]] (EFPIA) and of the [[International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations]] (IFPMA)

==History==
The company was founded by [[Hans Lundbeck]] in 1915, and was initially a [[trading company]] supplying a variety of goods to the Danish market, including [[machinery]] for [[manufacturing]], [[aluminium foil]], [[artificial sweetener]]s, and [[photography|photographic equipment]].

Lundbeck entered the pharmaceutical market in 1924, importing [[medicine]]s and [[cosmetics]] from companies based in other [[Europe]]an and [[Americas|American]] countries. By the late 1930s, Lundbeck had begun to produce its own medicinal products and had established its own [[research]] department. Production continued during the [[Second World War]], although it was limited due to a lack of raw materials.

After the war, Lundbeck continued to grow and in 1957 the company introduced Truxal ([[chlorprothixene]]) for the treatment of schizophrenia, entering the market for brain disorders. In 1954, the Lundbeck Foundation was established to maintain and expand the activities of Lundbeck Group and also to provide funding for scientific research of the highest quality. 
From the late 1970s and up through the 1980s, Lundbeck diverted its old agency business and thus became a dedicated pharmaceutical company focusing on the production of drugs used to treat disorders and diseases of the [[central nervous system]]. 
In 1989, Lundbeck launched the antidepressant Celexa ([[citalopram]]), which became the cornerstone for the company’s international expansion and in 2009 Lundbeck, bought Ovation and established a commercial platform in the USA.<ref name="lundbeck.com"/>

In 2012, to focus on newer, strategic CNS-products, Lundbeck sold a portfolio of non-core products to [[Recordati S.p.A.]] (Recordati Rare Diseases).<ref>{{cite web|author1=H. Lundbeck A/S|title=Corporate Release No 487.

==Controversy==
Lundbeck formerly held the only license to manufacture [[pentobarbital]] (Nembutal) in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cphpost.dk/business/business/51348-execution-drug-still-available-after-lundbeck-shuns-end-user-agreements.html
|title=Execution drug still available after Lundbeck shuns ‘end user’ agreements
|newspaper=The Copenhagen Post
|date=1 April 2011
|accessdate=3 July 2011}}</ref> The drug is commonly used for execution by [[lethal injection]] in the United States (either as part of a three drug cocktail or by itself). After coming under criticism for not adding an [[End-user license agreement|‘end user’ agreement]] to prevent importers from selling Nembutal<sup>®</sup> to American prisons for use in executions, Lundbeck announced that it would not sell Nembutal to prisons in U.S. states that carry out executions. By introducing a new distribution system, Nembutal will be supplied exclusively through a specialty pharmacy drop ship program that will deny distribution of the product to prisons in U.S. states currently active in carrying out the death penalty by lethal injection.

|title=Lundbeck Seeks to Curb Use of Drug in Executions
|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal
|date=1 July 2011
|accessdate=3 July 2011}}</ref> In December 2011 Lundbeck divested a portfolio of products including Nembutal to US pharmaceutical company [[Akorn|Akorn Inc.]] As part of the agreement, Akorn committed to continue with Lundbeck's restricted distribution program for Nembutal, which was implemented to restrict the use of the product in the US.

==2013 fine==
On June 19, 2013, the [[European Commission]] imposed a fine of €93.8 million on Lundbeck and fined several producers of [[Generic drug|generic pharmaceuticals]] a total of €52.2 million after Lundbeck made agreements in 2002 with the other companies to delay less expensive generics of Lundbeck's [[citalopram]] from entering the market. In return for the ability to maintain a [[monopoly]] on the drug's manufacture, Lundbeck offered payments and other [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]].<ref>http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-563_en.htm</ref>
