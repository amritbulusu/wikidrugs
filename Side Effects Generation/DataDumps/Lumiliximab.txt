'''Lumiliximab''' is an IgG1k [[monoclonal antibody]] that targets [[CD23]]. It acts as an [[immunomodulator]]<ref name="INN">[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/druginfo/INN_2004_list52.pdf International Nonproprietary Names for Pharmaceutical Substances (INN)]. ''World Health Organization''.</ref> and was awarded [[orphan drug status]] and [[fast track (FDA)|fast track]] designation by the FDA.<ref name="adisinsight.springer.com">http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800008890{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}</ref>

It was investigated in Phase II/III [[clinical trials]] for the treatment of [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]].<ref>{{Cite journal| first2 = T. J.| first6 = W. | last1 = Byrd | first3 = I.
