*''[[Staphylococcus saprophyticus]]''
*[[Coagulase negative staphylococci]]
*''[[Enterococcus faecalis]]''
*''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''

[[Antibiotic susceptibility testing]] should always be performed to further elucidate the resistance profile of the particular strain of bacteria causing infection.

===Pregnancy===
Nitrofurantoin is [[pregnancy category]] B.<ref name="Macrobid Drug Label1" /> It is one of the few drugs commonly used in pregnancy to treat UTIs.<ref name="pmid18556490">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee M, Bozzo P, Einarson A, Koren G |title=Urinary tract infections in pregnancy |journal=Can Fam Physician |volume=54 |issue=6 |pages=853–4 |date=June 2008 |pmid= 18556490|pmc= 2426978|doi= |url=http://www.cfp.ca/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18556490}}</ref> Other drugs used for UTIs in pregnancy include [[cephalexin]], [[amoxicillin]], and [[pivmecillinam]].

Newborns of women given this drug late in pregnancy had a higher risk of developing neonatal [[jaundice]].<ref name=Pregnancy>{{cite journal| last=Nordeng| first=H| author2=Lupattelli, A |author3=Romøren, M |author4= Koren, G |title=Neonatal outcomes after gestational exposure to nitrofurantoin.|journal=Obstetrics and gynecology|date=Feb 2013|volume=121|issue=2 Pt 1| pages=306–13| pmid=23344280| doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e31827c5f88}}</ref>

Several trials on the safety and [[Teratology|teratogenicity]] of nitrofurantoin in pregnancy have shown mixed results. A [[retrospective study]] in 2009 claimed that several birth defects, such as [[hypoplastic left heart syndrome]], [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmic]] malformations, [[cleft lip]] and [[cleft palate]], and [[atrial septal defect]], were more common in neonates exposed to nitrofurantoin during pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Crider|first=KS|author2=Cleves, MA |author3=Reefhuis, J |author4=Berry, RJ |author5=Hobbs, CA |author6= Hu, DJ |title=Antibacterial medication use during pregnancy and risk of birth defects: National Birth Defects Prevention Study.| journal=Archives of pediatrics & adolescent medicine|date=Nov 2009| volume=163| issue=11| pages=978–85| pmid=19884587|doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2009.188}}</ref> A [[meta analysis]] of four out of twenty-two available studies on the safety of nitrofurantoin found no increased risk.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Ben David S, Einarson T, Ben David Y, Nulman I, Pastuszak A, Koren G|title=The safety of nitrofurantoin during the first trimester of pregnancy: meta-analysis.|journal=Fundamental & clinical pharmacology| date=1995| volume=9| issue=5| pages=503–7| pmid=8617414| doi=10.1111/j.1472-8206.1995.tb00525.x}}</ref> A [[case-control study]] in 1998 found an increased risk of [[craniosynostosis]] after exposure to "nitrosatable" drugs.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gardner|first=JS|author2=Guyard-Boileau, B |author3=Alderman, BW |author4=Fernbach, SK |author5=Greene, C |author6= Mangione, EJ |title=Maternal exposure to prescription and non-prescription pharmaceuticals or drugs of abuse and risk of craniosynostosis.|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology|date=Feb 1998|volume=27|issue=1|pages=64–7|pmid=9563695|doi=10.1093/ije/27.1.64}}</ref> A more recent 2013 population-based [[cohort study]] which used women registered in the Norwegian Prescription Database and linked the subjects to a birth outcomes database, however, found no increased risk of major malformations in neonates born to women who took nitrofurantoin in early pregnancy.<ref name="Pregnancy" /> Many of the studies showing increased risk of nitrofurantoin had limitations and relied on patients' recall of the antibiotics they took during pregnancy rather than objective data, which may have led to [[recall bias]]. Nevertheless, in light of these conflicting data, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) recommends using antibiotics only for appropriate indications and for the shortest effective duration.<ref>{{cite journal|last=American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee on Obstetric Practice|title=ACOG Committee Opinion No. 494: Sulfonamides, nitrofurantoin, and risk of birth defects.|journal=Obstetrics and gynecology|date=Jun 2011| volume=117| issue=6| pages=1484–5| pmid=21606771| doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e3182238c57}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
The most common side effects with nitrofurantoin are nausea, headache, and flatulence. Less common adverse events (occurring in less than 1% of those taking the drug) include:<ref name="Macrobid Drug Label1" />
*Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, [[dyspepsia]], abdominal pain, constipation, emesis 
*Neurologic: dizziness, drowsiness, [[amblyopia]] 
*Respiratory: acute pulmonary hypersensitivity reaction 
*Allergic: [[pruritus]], [[urticaria]]
*Dermatologic: [[hair loss]] 
*Miscellaneous: fever, chills, malaise

Patients should be informed that nitrofurantoin colours urine brown; this is completely harmless.<ref name="Macrobid Drug Label1" />

Some of the more serious but rare side effects of nitrofurantoin have been a cause of concern. These include pulmonary reactions, hepatotoxicity, and neuropathy.

===Pulmonary toxicity===
The pulmonary toxicity caused by nitrofurantoin can be categorized into acute, subacute, and chronic pulmonary reactions. The acute and subacute reactions are thought to be due to a hypersensitivity reaction and often resolve when the drug is discontinued. Acute reactions have been estimated to occur in about one in 5000 women who take the drug.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Hospitalizations for pulmonary reactions following nitrofurantoin use.|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1378/chest.96.3.512|journal = Chest|date = 1989-09-01|issn = 0012-3692|pages = 512–515|volume = 96|issue = 3|doi = 10.1378/chest.96.3.512|first = S S|last = Jick|first2 = H|last2 = Jick|first3 = A M|last3 = Walker|first4 = J R|last4 = Hunter}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> These reactions usually develop 3–8 days after the first dose of nitrofurantoin, but may occur from a few hours to a few weeks after starting the drug. Symptoms include fever, [[dyspnea]], chills, cough, [[pleuritic]] chest pain, headache, back pain, and [[epigastric]] pain.  Chest radiograph will often show unilateral or bilateral infiltrates similar to [[pulmonary edema]]. Treatment includes discontinuation of the nitrofurantoin, which should result in symptom improvement within 24 hours.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=EM|author2=Triller, DM |title=Recurrent acute nitrofurantoin-induced pulmonary toxicity.|journal=Pharmacotherapy|date=May 2006|volume=26|issue=5|pages=713–8|pmid=16718946|doi=10.1592/phco.26.5.713}}</ref>

Chronic pulmonary reactions caused by nitrofurantoin include diffuse [[interstitial pneumonitis]], [[pulmonary fibrosis]], or both.<ref name="Macrobid Drug Label1" /> This uncommon reaction may occur 1 month to 6 years after starting the drug and is usually related to its total lifetime dose. This reaction manifests with progressive shortness of breath.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Goemaere NN, Grijm K, van Hal PT, den Bakker MA|title=Nitrofurantoin-induced pulmonary fibrosis: a case report|journal=Journal of Medical Case Reports| date=2008| volume=2| issue=1| pages=169| pmc=2408600| doi=10.1186/1752-1947-2-169| accessdate=| pmid=18495029}}</ref> It is important to recognize nitrofurantoin as possible cause of symptoms and discontinue the drug when the suspicion of pulmonary side effects arises as it can be reversible if the drug is stopped early.<ref name=":0" />

===Hepatotoxicity===
Hepatic reactions, including [[hepatitis]], cholestatic [[jaundice]], chronic active hepatitis, and hepatic [[necrosis]], occur rarely. The onset of chronic active hepatitis may be insidious, and patients should be monitored periodically for changes in biochemical tests that would indicate liver injury.<ref name="Macrobid Drug Label1" /> These reactions usually occur after exposure to the drug for more than 6 weeks. If signs of liver failure are observed in a patient taking nitrofurantoin, the drug should be discontinued. Re-challenge with the drug at a later date is not recommended, as the reaction may have a hypersensitivity component and recur when the drug is resumed.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Amit| first=G| author2=Cohen, P |author3=Ackerman, Z |title=Nitrofurantoin-induced chronic active hepatitis.| journal=The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ| date=Mar 2002| volume=4|issue=3|pages=184–6|pmid=11908259}}</ref>

===Neuropathy===
[[Neuropathy]] is a rare side effect of taking nitrofurantoin. Patients may experience numbness and tingling in a stocking-glove pattern, which may or may not improve upon discontinuation of the drug.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Tan| first=IL| author2=Polydefkis, MJ |author3=Ebenezer, GJ |author4=Hauer, P |author5= McArthur, JC |title=Peripheral nerve toxic effects of nitrofurantoin|journal=Archives of neurology|date=February 2012|volume=69|issue=2|pages=265–8|pmid=22332195|doi=10.1001/archneurol.2011.1120}}</ref>

===Contraindications===
Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in patients with decreased renal function (CrCl < 60 ml/min) due to systemic accumulation and subtherapeutic levels reached in the urinary tract.<ref name="Macrobid Drug Label1" /> However, a retrospective chart review suggests the data for this cutoff are slim and a cutoff of CrCl < 40 ml/min would be more appropriate.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Oplinger| first=M| author2=Andrews, CO |title=Nitrofurantoin contraindication in patients with a creatinine clearance below 60 mL/min: looking for the evidence|journal=The Annals of pharmacotherapy|date=Jan 2013| volume=47| issue=1| pages=106–11| pmid=23341159|doi=10.1345/aph.1R352}}</ref> Many of the severe side effects of this drug are more common in the elderly and those with renal impairment, as this causes the drug to be retained in the body and reach higher systemic levels. Thus, the drug is not recommended for the elderly population according to 2012 AGS Beers criteria.<ref>{{cite journal|last=American Geriatrics Society 2012 Beers Criteria Update Expert Panel|title=American Geriatrics Society updated Beers Criteria for potentially inappropriate medication use in older adults.|journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society|date=Apr 2012|volume=60|issue=4|pages=616–31|pmid=22376048|accessdate=|doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.2012.03923.x|pmc=3571677}}</ref>

Nitrofurantoin is also contraindicated in babies up to the age of one month, as they have immature enzyme systems in their [[erythrocyte|red blood cell]]s ([[glutathione]] instability), so nitrofurantoin must not be used because it can cause [[haemolytic anaemia]]. For the same reason, nitrofurantoin should not be given to pregnant women after 38 weeks of pregnancy. Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in patients with [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]] because of risk of [[intravascular]] [[hemolysis]] resulting in [[anemia]].<ref name="Macrobid Drug Label1" />

==Pharmacology==
Organisms are said to be susceptible to nitrofurantoin if their [[minimum inhibitory concentration]] is 32 [[Wiktionary:microgram|μg]]/ml or less. The peak blood concentration of nitrofurantoin following an oral dose of nitrofurantoin 100&nbsp;mg, is less than 1 μg/ml and may be undetectable. Its bioavailability is about 90% and the urinary excretion is 40%<ref>Antibiot. Chemother. 1978, 25, 233–252</ref>{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}} tissue penetration is negligible; the drug is well concentrated in the urine: 75% of the dose is rapidly metabolised by the liver, but 25% of the dose is excreted in the urine unchanged, reliably achieving levels of 200 μg/ml or more. In studies of dogs, the majority of urinary excretion is through glomerular filtration with some tubular secretion.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Reappraisal of the risk/benefit of nitrofurantoin: review of toxicity and efficacy|last = Shah|date = 1989|journal = Adverse Drug Reactions and Acute Poisoning Reviews|doi = |pmid = 2694823 |volume=8 |pages=183–201}}</ref> There is also tubular absorption which is increased with urine acidification.<ref name=":1" /> However the activity of nitrofurantoin is also pH dependent and mean inhibitory concentration rises sharply with increased pH above 6.<ref name=":1" /> Nitrofurantoin cannot be used to treat infections other than simple [[cystitis]].

At the concentrations achieved in urine (>100 μg/ml), nitrofurantoin is a [[bactericide]]. It is [[bacteriostatic]] against most susceptible organisms at concentrations less than 32 μg/ml.<ref name="Macrobid Drug Label1" />

Nitrofurantoin and the [[quinolone antibiotic]]s are mutually antagonistic ''in vitro''. It is not known whether this is of clinical significance, but the combination should be avoided.<ref name="Macrobid Drug Label1" />

Resistance to nitrofurantoin may be chromosomal or plasmid-mediated and involves inhibition of nitrofuran reductase.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=McCalla DR, Kaiser C, Green MH | title=Genetics of nitrofurazone resistance in ''Escherichia coli'' | journal=J Bacteriol | year=1978 | volume=133 | pages=10&ndash;16 }}</ref>  Acquired resistance in ''E. coli'' continues to be rare.

Nitrofurantoin and its metabolites are excreted mainly by the kidneys. In renal impairment, the concentration achieved in urine may be subtherapeutic. Nitrofurantoin should not be used in patients with a [[creatinine clearance]] of 60 ml/min or less. However, a retrospective chart review may suggest nitrofurantoin is not contraindicated in this population.<ref name="Bains A, Buna D, Hoag NA 2009 248–252">{{cite journal |vauthors=Bains A, Buna D, Hoag NA | title=A retrospective review assessing the efficacy and safety of nitrofurantoin in renal impairment | journal=Canadian Pharmacists Journal| year=2009| volume=142| pages=248&ndash;252|url=http://www.cpjournal.ca/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.3821%2F1913-701X-142.5.248 | doi=10.3821/1913-701X-142.5.248 | issue=5 }}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Nitrofurantoin is concentrated in the urine, leading to higher and more effective levels in the [[Urinary system|urinary tract]] than in other tissues or [[Compartment (pharmacokinetics)|compartments]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|title = Nitrofurantoin revisited: a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials|url = http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/70/9/2456|journal = Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy|date = 2015-09-01|issn = 0305-7453|pmid = 26066581|pages = 2456–2464|volume = 70|issue = 9|doi = 10.1093/jac/dkv147|language = en|first = Angela|last = Huttner|first2 = Els M.|last2 = Verhaegh|first3 = Stephan|last3 = Harbarth|first4 = Anouk E.|last4 = Muller|first5 = Ursula|last5 = Theuretzbacher|first6 = Johan W.|last6 = Mouton}}</ref> With a 100&nbsp;mg oral dose, [[Blood plasma|plasma]] levels are typically less than 1 [[Microgram|µg]]/ml while in the urine it reaches 200&nbsp;µg/ml.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Basic Principles of Drug Discovery and Development|last = Blass|first = Benjamin|publisher = |year = |isbn = 9780124115255|location = |pages = 513}}</ref>

The mechanism of action is unique and complex. The drug works by damaging bacterial [[DNA]], since its reduced form is highly reactive.<ref name="Macrobid Drug Label1" /> This is made possible by the rapid reduction of nitrofurantoin inside the bacterial cell by [[flavoprotein]]s (nitrofuran reductase) to multiple reactive intermediates that attack [[ribosome|ribosomal]] proteins, DNA,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Tu Y, McCalla DR | title=Effect of activated nitrofurans on DNA, | year=1975 | journal=Biochim Biophys Acta | volume=402 | pages=142&ndash;49 }}</ref> respiration, [[pyruvate]] metabolism and other macromolecules within the cell. Nitrofurantoin exerts greater effects on bacterial cells than mammalian cells because bacterial cells activate the drug more rapidly. It is not known which of the actions of nitrofurantoin is primarily responsible for its bactericidal activity. The broad mechanism of action for this drug likely is responsible for the low development of resistance to its effects, as the drug affects many different processes important to the bacterial cell.<ref name="Macrobid Drug Label1" />

==History==
Nitrofurantoin has been available for the treatment of lower [[urinary tract infection]]s (UTIs) since 1953.<ref name=Ben2015/>

==Animal feed==
Residues from the breakdown of [[nitrofuran]] veterinary antibiotics, including nitrofurantoin, have been found in chicken in [[Vietnam]], [[China]], [[Brazil]], and [[Thailand]].<ref name="fao">[http://www.fao.org/docrep/008/y5723e/y5723e0u.htm FAO: Nitrofuran study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204032125/http://www.fao.org/docrep/008/y5723e/y5723e0u.htm |date=2008-12-04 }}</ref> The European Union banned the use of nitrofurans in food producing animals by classifying it in ANNEX IV (list of pharmacologically active substances for which no maximum residue limits can be fixed) of the Council Regulation 2377/90. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) of the United States has prohibited furaltadone since February 1985 and withdrew the approval for the other nitrofuran drugs (except some topical uses) in January 1992. The topical use of [[furazolidone]] and [[nitrofurazone]] was prohibited in 2002. Australia prohibited the use of nitrofurans in food production in 1992. Japan did not allocate MRLs for nitrofurans leading to the implementation of a "zero tolerance or no residue standard". In Thailand, the [[Ministry of Public Health (Thailand)|Ministry of Health]] issued in 2001 Proclamation No. 231 MRL of veterinary drug in food which did not allocate MRL for nitrofurans. The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives had already prohibited importation and use of furazolidone and nitrofurazone in animal feed in 1999 which was extended to all nitrofurans in 2002. Several metabolites of nitrofurans, such as furazolidone, furaltadone and nitrofurazone cause cancer or genetic damage in rats.<ref name="fao"/>
