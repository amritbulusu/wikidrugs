'''Ticagrelor''' (trade name '''Brilinta''', '''Brilique''', and '''Possia''') is a [[platelet aggregation inhibitor]] produced by [[AstraZeneca]].

Ticagrelor is an antagonist of the [[P2Y12|P2Y<sub>12</sub>]] receptor.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jacobson|first=Kenneth A.|author2=Boeynaems, Jean-Marie |title=P2Y nucleotide receptors: promise of therapeutic applications|journal=Drug Discovery Today|date=July 2010|volume=15|issue=13–14|pages=570–578|doi=10.1016/j.drudis.2010.05.011|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359644610001807|pmid=20594935|pmc=2920619}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
Ticagrelor is used for the prevention of thrombotic events (for example [[stroke]] or [[heart attack]]) in people with [[acute coronary syndrome]] or myocardial infarction with [[ST elevation]]. The drug is combined with [[acetylsalicylic acid]] unless the latter is contraindicated.<ref name="AustriaCodex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2010|edition=2010/2011|language=German}}</ref> There is no high quality evidence for the use of ticagrelor before [[percutaneous coronary intervention]] (PCI) in non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome.<ref name=BMJP2Y12>{{cite journal|last1=Bellemain-Appaix|first1=A.|last2=Kerneis|first2=M.|last3=O'Connor|first3=S.

The FDA indication for ticagrelor is reduction of the rate of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in people with acute coronary syndrome or history of myocardial infarction.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

AHA/ACC Guidelines (09/2014) state: "It is reasonable to choose ticagrelor over [[clopidogrel]] for P2Y12 inhibition treatment in patients with NSTE-ACS treated with early invasive strategy and/or coronary stenting".

Ticagrelor was found to be comparable to acetylsalicylic acid in people with acute ischemic stroke or [[transient ischemic attack]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Johnston|first1=S.

==Contraindications==
Contraindications for ticagrelor are: active pathological bleeding and a history of [[intracranial bleeding]], as well as reduced [[liver]] function and combination with drugs that strongly influence activity of the liver enzyme [[CYP3A4]], because the drug is metabolized via CYP3A4 and excreted via the liver.<ref name="AustriaCodex" />

==Adverse effects==
The most common side effects are [[shortness of breath]] (dyspnea, 14%)<ref>[http://www1.astrazeneca-us.com/pi/brilinta.pdf Brilinta: Highlights of prescribing information]</ref> and various types of bleeding, such as [[hematoma]], [[nosebleed]], [[gastrointestinal]], [[Subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]] or [[dermal]] bleeding. Ventricular pauses of 3 seconds occur in 5 percent of people in the first week of treatment. Ticagrelor should be administered with caution or avoided in patients with advanced sinoauricular disease.<ref>6</ref> Allergic skin reactions such as [[rash]] and [[itching]] have been observed in less than 1% of patients.<ref name="AustriaCodex" />

==Interactions==
Inhibitors of the liver enzyme CYP3A4, such as [[ketoconazole]] and possibly [[grapefruit juice]], increase [[blood plasma]] levels of ticagrelor and consequently can lead to bleeding and other adverse effects. Conversely, drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4, for example [[simvastatin]], show increased plasma levels and more side effects if combined with ticagrelor. CYP3A4 inductors, for example [[rifampicin]] and possibly [[St. John's wort]], can reduce the effectiveness of ticagrelor. There is no evidence for interactions via [[CYP2C9]].

The drug also inhibits [[P-glycoprotein]] (P-gp), leading to increased plasma levels of [[digoxin]], [[ciclosporin]] and other P-gp substrates. Levels of ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX (the active metabolite of ticagrelor formed by O-deethylation<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Teng|first1=R|last2=Oliver|first2=S|last3=Hayes|first3=MA|last4=Butler|first4=K|title=Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of ticagrelor in healthy subjects.|journal=Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals|date=September 2010|volume=38|issue=9|pages=1514–21|pmid=20551239|doi=10.1124/dmd.110.032250}}</ref>) are not significantly influenced by P-gp inhibitors.<ref name="AustriaCodex" />

In the US a boxed warning states that use of ticagrelor with aspirin doses exceeding 100&nbsp;mg/day decreases the effectiveness of the medication.<ref name="urlAstraZeneca: Ticagrelor (Brilinta) Gains FDA Approval ?

==Chemistry==
Ticagrelor is a [[nucleoside]] analogue: the cyclopentane ring is similar to the [[sugar]] [[ribose]], and the nitrogen rich [[aromatic ring]] system resembles the [[nucleobase]] [[purine]], giving the molecule an overall similarity to [[adenosine]]. The substance has low solubility and low permeability under the [[Biopharmaceutics Classification System]].<ref name="EPAR Brilique" />

|}

==Pharmacokinetics==
Ticagrelor is absorbed quickly from the gut, the bioavailability being 36%, and reaches its peak concentration after about 1.5 hours. The main metabolite, AR-C124910XX, is formed quickly via CYP3A4 by de-hydroxyethylation at position 5 of the cyclopentane ring.<ref name="pmid20551239">{{cite journal |vauthors=Teng R, Oliver S, Hayes MA, Butler K | title = Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of ticagrelor in healthy subjects | journal = Drug Metab. Dispos. | volume = 38 | issue = 9 | pages = 1514–21 |date=September 2010 | pmid = 20551239 | doi = 10.1124/dmd.110.032250 }}</ref>  It peaks after about 2.5 hours. Both ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX are bound to plasma proteins (>99.7%), and both are pharmacologically active. Blood plasma concentrations are linearly dependent on the dose up to 1260&nbsp;mg (the sevenfold daily dose). The metabolite reaches 30–40% of ticagrelor's plasma concentrations. Drug and metabolite are mainly excreted via [[bile]] and [[feces]].

Plasma concentrations of ticagrelor are slightly increased (12–23%) in elderly patients, women, patients of [[Asian ethnicity]], and patients with mild hepatic impairment. They are decreased in patients that described themselves as 'coloured' and those with severe renal impairment. These differences are considered clinically irrelevant. In [[Japanese people]], concentrations are 40% higher than in [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]], or 20% after body weight correction. The drug has not been tested in patients with severe hepatic impairment.<ref name="AustriaCodex" />

== Mechanism of action ==
Like the [[thienopyridine]]s [[prasugrel]], [[clopidogrel]] and [[ticlopidine]], ticagrelor blocks [[ADP receptor|adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor]]s of subtype [[P2Y12|P2Y<sub>12</sub>]]. In contrast to the other antiplatelet drugs, ticagrelor has a binding site different from ADP, making it an [[allosteric]] antagonist, and the blockage is reversible.<ref name="pmid22282698">{{cite journal |vauthors=Birkeland K, Parra D, Rosenstein R | title = Antiplatelet therapy in acute coronary syndromes: focus on ticagrelor | journal = J Blood Med | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 197–219 | year = 2010 | pmid = 22282698 | pmc = 3262315 | doi = 10.2147/JBM.S9650 }}</ref> Moreover, the drug does not need [[hepatic]] activation, which might work better for patients with genetic variants regarding the enzyme [[CYP2C19]] (although it is not certain whether clopidogrel is significantly influenced by such variants).<ref>{{cite journal

Patients given ticagrelor were less likely to die from vascular causes, heart attack, or stroke but had greater chances of non-lethal bleeding (16.1% vs. 14.6%, p=0.0084) and higher rate of major bleeding not related to coronary-artery bypass grafting (4.5% vs. 3.8%, p=0.03). While the patient group on ticagrelor had more instances of fatal intracranial bleeding, there were significantly fewer cases of fatal non-intracranial bleeding, leading to an overall neutral effect on fatal or life-threatening bleeding vs. clopidogrel (p=0.70).

The PLATO trial showed a statistically insignificant trend toward worse outcomes with ticagrelor versus clopidogrel among US patients in the study – who comprised 1800 of the total 18,624 patients. The HR  actually reversed for the composite end point cardiovascular (death, MI, or stroke): 12.6% for patients given ticagrelor and 10.1% for patients given clopidogrel (HR = 1.27).
