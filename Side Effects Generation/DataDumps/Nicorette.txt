'''Nicorette''' is the brand name of a number of products for [[nicotine replacement therapy]] (NRT) that contain [[nicotine]]. Developed in the late 1970s in [[Sweden]] by {{Interlanguage link multi|AB Leo|sv|3=Leo Läkemedel AB}} in the form of a chewing gum, Nicorette was the first nicotine replacement product on the market.<ref name="inmemo">{{cite web|url=http://www.treatobacco.net/en/uploads/documents/Other%20Documents/In%20memory%20of%20Ove%20Ferno%20SRNT%20Newsletter%202008.pdf |title=In memoriam of Ove Fernö - the inventor or NRT and The Past, Present, and Future of NRT |author1=Karl Fagerstöm |author2=Anders Axelsson |author3=Lennart Sorelius |publisher=Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco Newsletter, September/October 2008, vol. 14, № 3 |quote=During the late 1960s and 70s he was responsible for the development of the first NR product – a chewing gum |date= |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6V54sakPw?url=http://www.treatobacco.net/en/uploads/documents/Other%20Documents/In%20memory%20of%20Ove%20Ferno%20SRNT%20Newsletter%202008.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-25 |accessdate=2014-12-25 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>

The brand name "Nicorette" comes from "nicotine" and {{lang-sv|rette}}, "right way".<ref name="Swedish" />

== Medical uses ==
Nicorette products are indicated for the relief of [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal symptoms]] associated with [[nicotine withdrawal]] and to aid in [[smoking cessation]].<ref name="mhrapatch">{{cite web|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/l-unit1/documents/websiteresources/con036311.pdf |title=Nicorette Invisi 10 mg patch, Nicorette Invisi 15 mg patch, Nicorette Invisi 25 mg patch, PL 15513/0159-61 |date=2008-12-02 |year= |website= |series= |publisher=[[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] |location= |page= |pages= |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6VRov0Vk6?url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/l-unit1/documents/websiteresources/con036311.pdf |archivedate=2015-01-09 |accessdate=2015-01-09 |quote= |ref= |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> It is suggested that Nicorette products should be used in "conjunction with a behavioural support programme".<ref name="mhrapatch" />

Prior to 2005 nicotine products in Britain were only licensed to "assist smokers who were making an immediate and complete quit attempt".<ref name="mhrarep">{{cite web|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/es-policy/documents/publication/con068571.pdf |title=MHRA Public Assessment Report: The use of nicotine replacement therapy to reduce harm in smokers, February 2010 |date= |year=2010 |website= |series= |publisher=[[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] |location= |page= |pages= |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6VRpgDPgn?url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/es-policy/documents/publication/con068571.pdf |archivedate=2015-01-09 |accessdate=2015-01-09 |quote= |ref= |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> Following advice from a working group set up by the [[Committee on Safety of Medicines]] (since 2005 the [[Commission on Human Medicines]]) the [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency|MHRA]] concluded that NRT products should be used also by those who are unable to stop abruptly.<ref name="mhrarep" />

Currently Nicorette products in the UK are indicated to:
* relieve craving (the urge to smoke),
* relieve withdrawal symptoms ([[irritability]], impatience; difficulty in concentrating),
* improve the likelihood of a successful abrupt quit attempt,
* reduce the amount smoked in those not immediately motivated to quit.<ref name="mhrarep" />

The products are intended for adults and children over 12 years of age as well as pregnant and lactating women<ref name="mhragum">{{cite web|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/l-unit1/documents/websiteresources/con2024562.pdf |title=Nicorette Peppermint 2 and 4 mg gum, Nicorette Ice Mint 2 and 4 mg gum, Nicorette Spearmint 2 and 4 mg gum, PL 15513/0136-7, PL 15513/0143-4, PL 15513/0152-3 |date=2006-07-18 |website= |series= |publisher=[[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] |location= |page= |pages= |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6VRs0AJVx?url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/l-unit1/documents/websiteresources/con2024562.pdf |archivedate=2015-01-09 |accessdate=2015-01-09 |quote= |ref= |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> (it has been concluded that "the use of NRT in pregnancy does not give undue concern and any harm caused by nicotine replacement must be compared with that caused by continued smoking – which is extremely harmful to both the woman and her child".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/pl-a/documents/websiteresources/con2023239.pdf |title=Report of the Committee on Safety of Medicines Working Group on Nicotine Replacement Therapy, November 2005 |date= |year=2005 |website= |series= |publisher=[[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] |location= |page= |pages= |accessdate=2015-01-09 |quote= |ref= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214073332/http://www.mhra.gov.uk:80/home/groups/pl-a/documents/websiteresources/con2023239.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-14 |df= }}</ref>)  

Nicorette , like all other NRT products,  are most beneficial for heavy smokers (more than 15 cigarettes per day). There are not enough studies to show that NRT helps those who smoke fewer than 10 cigarettes per day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nicotine replacement therapy|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007438.htm|author=David C.

== Contraindications ==
The typical contraindication (reason to not use) for Nicorette products is hypersensitivity to nicotine.<ref name="mhrapatch" /><ref name="mhragum" />

Up until recently [[cardiovascular disease]] was considered to be a contraindication to nicotine replacement therapy products. However, in 2003 the French Agency for the Safety of Health Products ([[Agence française de sécurité sanitaire des produits de santé|AFSSAPS]]) removed all cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease contraindications. In 2005 the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency followed suit. The rationale is that the benefit of nicotine replacement therapy outweighs the risks of nicotine medication, even in smokers with cardiovascular disease.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treatobacco.net/en/page_75.php |title=Nicotine is not a significant risk factor for cardiovascular events.

In 2013 the US [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] stated that the contraindication concerning usage of NRT products while smoking is no longer valid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm345087.htm |title=Nicotine Replacement Therapy Labels May Change |date=2013-04-01 |year= |website= |series= |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]] |location= |page= |pages= |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6VS9Rf1u1?url=http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm345087.htm |archivedate=2015-01-09 |accessdate=2015-01-09 |quote= |ref= |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>

The FDA approved [[Packaging and labeling|labeling]] for Nicorette products with a warning concerning [[pregnancy]] and [[breastfeeding]]: "This medicine is believed to be safer than smoking. However, the risks to your child from this medicine are not fully known".<ref name="fdagum">{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/018612Orig1s074,%20020066Orig1s055lbl.pdf |title=Nicorette, Nicotine Polacrilex, Labeling Revision  10/30/2014 |date=2014-10-30 |year= |website= |series= |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]] |location= |page= |pages= |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6VSDayYiZ?url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/018612Orig1s074,%20020066Orig1s055lbl.pdf |archivedate=2015-01-09 |accessdate=2015-01-09 |quote= |ref= |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> The FDA suggests not using Nicorette products if the patient continues to smoke, or use chewing tobacco, snuff or other nicotine-containing products.<ref name="fdagum" />

The FDA advises consulting a doctor before using the product if the patient previously had:
* heart disease, recent heart attack, or irregular heartbeat,
* high blood pressure,
* taken a prescription medicine for depression or asthma.
Specific contraindications listed by the FDA for various formats include sodium-restricted diet, stomach ulcer of diabetes (for gums<ref name="fdagum" /> and lozenges), or an allergy to adhesive tape or skin problems (for patches).<ref name="fdapatch">{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/020165Orig1s029lbl.pdf |title=Nicoderm, Labeling Revision  10/30/2014 |date=2014-04-30 |year= |website= |series= |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]] |location= |page= |pages= |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6VSF7rGmn?url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/020165Orig1s029lbl.pdf |archivedate=2015-01-09 |accessdate=2015-01-09 |quote= |ref= |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>

The FDA suggests stopping use of Nicorette products in cases of irregular heartbeat or palpitations, symptoms of nicotine overdose ([[nausea]], [[vomiting]], dizziness, weakness, and rapid heartbeat)<ref name="fdagum" /> or skin redness caused by the patch.<ref name="fdapatch" />

== Mechanism of action, formats, dosages and administration ==

=== Chewing gum ===

Nicorette chewing gum releases nicotine while chewing. Nicotine then is absorbed across the [[oral mucosa]] into the [[systemic circulation]]. Patients are advised to chew the gum slowly and intermittently to avoid the risk of releasing too much nicotine. It is also suggested not to eat or drink while chewing since foods and beverages can reduce nicotine absorption.<ref name="lehne">{{cite book|last1= Burchum|first1=Jacqueline|last2= Rosenthal|first2=Laura|year=2014|chapter=Chapter 39: Drug Abuse III: Nicotine and Smoking |title= Lehne's Pharmacology for Nursing Care|edition=|page=427|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=0323340261|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C7_NBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA427&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=2015-01-18}}(Google Books)</ref>

Nicorette chewing gum is available in two strengths: 2&nbsp;mg/piece and 4&nbsp;mg/piece. Dosing would depend on the degree of nicotine dependence: light smokers should use 2&nbsp;mg gum, heavy smokers (more than 25 cigarettes a day) should use 4&nbsp;mg gum.<ref name="lehne" />
Patients should chew gum once they feel the craving. The average adult dosage is 9 to 12 pieces per day.<ref name="lehne" /> FDA limits maximum daily amount of 2&nbsp;mg gums to 24 pieces.<ref name="fdagum" />

It is suggested to use gum following a 12-week schedule, reducing the amount of gums consumed by the end of the therapy.<ref name="fdagum" />

=== Invisi Patch ===
The patches provide slow absorption of nicotine into blood within the day and work for 16 hours.<ref name="rutter">{{cite book|last=Rutter|first=Paul| year=2013|chapter=Nicorette |title= Community Pharmacy: Symptoms, Diagnosis and Treatment|edition=3|page=320|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=0702054739|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_mI_n3y5koC&pg=PA320&dq=#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=2015-01-18}}(Google Books)</ref> They are usually applied in the morning and removed at bedtime.

The patch supports smoking cessation within 12 week programme: 25&nbsp;mg patch (25&nbsp;mg nicotine over 16 hours) for eight weeks (Step 1), 15&nbsp;mg patch for two weeks (Step 2), 10&nbsp;mg patch for the last two weeks (Step 3). Light smokers (less than 10 cigarettes per day) were recommended to start at Step 2 (15&nbsp;mg) for eight weeks and reduce the dose to 10&nbsp;mg for the last four weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mims.co.uk/more/NewDrugs/article/892146/New-high-strength-nicotine-patch/ |title=New high-strength nicotine patch |date=2009-02-24 |year= |website= |series= |publisher=[[Monthly Index of Medical Specialities]] |location= |page= |pages= |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6VECO3ecd?url=http://m.mims.co.uk/article/892146/new-high-strength-nicotine-patch |archivedate=2014-12-31 |accessdate=2014-12-31 |quote= |ref= |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>

=== Microtab ===
Microtab supplies nicotine to the body orally. It is different from the chewing gum because instead of chewing the patient should allow the tablet to dissolve slowly under the tongue (the tablet dissolves in about 20-30 [[minute]]s).<ref name="stop">{{cite book|last=Willis|first=Nicola| year=2012|chapter=Which Treatment?|title=Stop! No Smoking Programme |edition=|page=69|publisher=Random House|isbn=1448148952}}</ref> The action is similar to 2&nbsp;mg nicotine gum.<ref name="stop" />

Microtabs are used either for smoking cessation or smoking reduction. For smoking cessation the standard dose is one tablet (2&nbsp;mg) per hour for patients who smoke less than 20 cigarettes per day. When the craving is strong two tablets can be taken instead of one. Most patients require between 8 and 24 tablets per day.<ref name="rutter" /> British [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] recommends not to exceed 40 tablets per day limit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/par/documents/websiteresources/con054754.pdf |title=Public Assessment Report: Nicorette Microtab Lemon 2mg sublingual tablets.

=== QuickMist spray ===
[[File:Nicorette QuickMist Spray.jpg|thumb|Nicorette QuickMist spray at the pharmacy (France)]]
Nicorette QuickMist spray is a liquid solution spray in a [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET) bottle placed in a dispenser with a mechanical spray pump. One bottle contains 13.2 ml of solution (at least 150 sprays).<ref name="quickm" />  The solution consists of 1&nbsp;mg of [[nicotine]],  [[propylene glycol]], anhydrous [[enthanol]], [[Tris|trometamol]], [[poloxamer 407]], [[glycerol]], [[Sodium bicarbonate|sodium hydrogen carbonate]], [[Menthol|levomenthol]], mint flavour, cooling flavour, [[sucralose]], [[acesulfame potassium]], [[hydrochloric acid]] and purified [[water]].

Spray is administered when one has a desire to smoke. MHRA suggests not to use more than 2 sprays at a time, up to 4 sprays per hour and no more than 64 sprays per 24 hours period.<ref name="quickm" />

The spray is considered to be the most advanced format of [[nicotine replacement therapy]]<ref name="Tonessen" />{{MEDRS|date=September 2017}} due to the speed of action. As explained by Gay Sutherland, research psychologist at the Tobacco Research Unit, [[King's College London|Kings College]] "after taking a puff on a cigarette, smokers get nicotine hit to the brain within around 20 seconds. Most nicotine replacement therapies can take between 30 minutes and three hours to deliver their effect" while the spray has a proven ability to deliver nicotine to the brain within 60 seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.easier.com/98047-spray-smoke-free-new-year.html |title=Spray your way to a smoke-free New Year |date=2012-01-05 |publisher=Easier.com |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6ZhXG45j3?url=http://www.easier.com/98047-spray-smoke-free-new-year.html |archivedate=2015-07-01 |accessdate=2015-07-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>{{MEDRS|date=September 2017}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/wellbeing/lifecoach/8490484/Lifecoach-Im-putting-on-weight-but-cant-face-the-gym.html |title=Lifecoach: I'm putting on weight but can't face the gym |last1=Gallagher |first1=Tony |date=2011-05-04 |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6ZhXUMaDB?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/wellbeing/lifecoach/8490484/Lifecoach-Im-putting-on-weight-but-cant-face-the-gym.html |archivedate=2015-07-01 |accessdate=2015-07-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>{{MEDRS|date=September 2017}} There is also clinical data proving that using the spray double the chances of successfully quitting compared to willpower alone (a relatevie success rate of 2.48 compared to placebo regarding abstinence at 1 year).<ref name="Tonessen">

The first nicotine chewing gum was produced at AB Leo in 1971. The innovation was in the use of [[ion-exchange resin]] ([[Nicotine polacrilex|polacrilex]]) in order to control the rate of release of nicotine during chewing. Fernö explained, "Putting nicotine into chewing gum is not an invention. Fixing the nicotine to an ion exchange resin and putting that in a chewing gum to enable the chewer to control the rate of release—that is an invention".<ref name="wiley" />{{rp|1220}} The same year Håkan Westling, Professor of Clinical Physiology at Lund University, started the first clinical trials of the gum as an aid to smoking cessation at the university hospital. His findings were presented at the Second World Conference on Smoking and Health in London<ref name="Swedish" />{{rp|146}} and were published in 1973 in the journal ''Psychopharmacologia'' together with an article by Fernö.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Brantmark B, Ohlin P, Westling H | date      = 1973-07-19| title     = Nicotine-containing chewing gum as an anti-smoking aid.| url       = | journal   = Psychopharmacologia| publisher = | volume    =  31| issue     = 3| pages     = 191–200| doi       = 10.1007/bf00422509| pmc       = | pmid      = 4581737}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| author    = Fernö O.| date      = 1973-07-19| title     = A substitute for tobacco smoking.| url       = | journal   = Psychopharmacologia| publisher = | volume    =  31| issue     = 3| pages     = 201–204| doi       = | pmc       = | pmid      = 4732726}}</ref>

Nicotine chewing gum was presented at the Third World Conference on Smoking and Health in New York in 1975 by Fernö in partnership with the British researcher Michael Russell from the [[Institute of Psychiatry]], who pioneered the measurement of blood nicotine levels. Russell and his colleagues at the Addiction Research Unit at the Institute of Psychiatry became involved in further research into nicotine gum through randomised controlled trials funded by the British Medical Research Council and the UK [[Department of Health and Social Security]].<ref name="Swedish" />{{rp|147}}

Nicorette was registered as a drug in Switzerland in 1978, in Canada in 1979, and in the UK in 1980.<ref name="Swedish" />{{rp|147}} It was registered in Sweden in 1981. Initially the Swedish [[Medical Products Agency (Sweden)|Medical Products Agency]] declined to approve Nicorette as a medicine because it considered smoking not an addiction, but a lifestyle choice; and the Swedish [[National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden)|National Board of Health and Welfare]] regarded orally consumed nicotine products not as medicine but as foodstuffs.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Kalkhoff|first1=Will|last2=Thye|first2=Shane R.|last3=Lawler|first3=Edward J.|date=|year=2012|chapter=The Birth of Medicinal Nicotine|title= Critical Perspectives on Addiction |edition=1st|page=79|publisher= Emerald Group Publishing |isbn=1780529317|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8WxycrG-j1UC&pg=PA63&dq=#v=onepage&q&f=false }}</ref>

On January 13, 1984 Nicorette chewing gum was approved by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] after a 34-month review. It was brought to the US market by [[Marion Merrell Dow]] under licence from AB Leo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet/46/004/merrell-dow-nicorette-antismoking-rx-chewing-gum-trade-shipments |title=Merrell Dow Nicorette Anti-Smoking Rx Chewing Gum Trade Shipments |date=1984-01-23 |year= |website= |series= |publisher=The Pink Sheet |location= |page= |pages= |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6VNPO9iE4?url=https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet/46/004/merrell-dow-nicorette-antismoking-rx-chewing-gum-trade-shipments |archivedate=2015-01-06 |accessdate=2015-01-05 |quote= |ref= |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>
