'''Phenazocine''' (brand names '''Prinadol''', '''Narphen''') is an [[opioid analgesic]] [[pharmaceutical drug|drug]], which is related to [[pentazocine]] and has a similar profile of effects.

Effects of phenazocine include analgesia and [[euphoria]], also may include [[dysphoria]] and [[hallucinations]] at high doses, most likely due to action at [[Kappa opioid receptor|κ-opioid]] and [[Sigma receptor|σ receptors]].<ref name="Harris">{{cite journal |vauthors=Harris LS, Pierson AK | title=Some Narcotic Antagonists in the Benzomorphan Series | journal=Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics |date=February 1964 | pages=141–8 | volume= 143| issue=  | pmid=14163985}}</ref>

Phenazocine appears to be a much stronger analgesic with fewer side effects than pentazocine, probably due to a more favorable [[mu opioid receptor|μ]]/κ binding ratio. 
Phenazocine is a much more potent analgesic than pentazocine and other drugs in the benzomorphan series, most probably due to the presence of an N-phenethyl substitution, which is known to boost μ-opioid activity in many classes of opioid analgesics.<ref name="Feinberg">{{cite journal |vauthors=Feinberg AP, Creese I, Snyder SH | title=The opiate receptor: a model explaining structure-activity relationships of opiate agonists and antagonists | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA |date=November 1976 | pages=4215–9 | volume=73 | issue=11 | pmid=186791 | doi=10.1073/pnas.73.11.4215 | pmc= 431391}}</ref>

Consequently, phenazocine is some 4x the potency of [[morphine]] as an analgesic. Also it does not cause spasm of the [[sphincter of Oddi]], making it more suitable than morphine for the treatment of [[biliary]] or [[pancreatic]] pain.<ref name="Hopton">

==History==
Phenazocine was invented in the 1950s.<ref name="Clarke">{{cite journal | author= Clarke EG | title=Identification of Phenazocine, a Potent New Analgesic | journal=Nature | date=August 8, 1959 | pages=451–451 | volume= 184 | issue= Suppl 7  | pmid=13810504 | doi= 10.1038/184451a0}}</ref><ref name="Eckenhoff">{{cite journal | author= Eckenhoff JE | title=Phenazocine, a new benzomorphan narcotic analgesic | journal=Anesthesiology | date=May–June 1959 | pages=355–8 | volume=20 | issue=3 | pmid=13650222 | doi= 10.1097/00000542-195905000-00016}}</ref>  It was one of a number of [[benzomorphan]] opioids (including [[pentazocine]], [[dezocine]], and [[cyclazocine]]) developed in the search for non-addictive strong analgesics.

Phenazocine was once widely used, and was mainly supplied as 5&nbsp;mg tablets of the [[hydrobromide]] salt for sublingual use (Narphen, Prinadol and other names), but its use was discontinued in the [[United Kingdom]] in 2001.<ref name="discontinueUK">{{cite web |date=February 2001 | url = http://www.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk/systemsandservices/data/readcodes/docs/tandc0201.pdf | archive-url = http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081106082526/http://www.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk/systemsandservices/data/readcodes/docs/tandc0201.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2008-11-06 | title = Monthly Release Terming and Coding Newsletter | format = PDF | publisher = NHS Information Authority | accessdate = 2008-01-11}} </ref>

Phenazocine was briefly used in the United States but fell out of favour for the above-mentioned reasons;{{which|date=May 2013}}{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} it remains a Schedule II substance under the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Control & Prevention Act (aka Controlled Substances Act) of 1970 (CSA) but is not manufactured; other Schedule II narcotics not in use in the United States include [[bezitramide]] and [[metopon]].  The DEA ACSCN for phenazocine is 9715 and its 2013 annual manufacturing quota was 6 grammes <ref>http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/quotas/2013/fr0620.htm</ref>
