'''Nitrosoprodenafil''' is a synthetic [[designer drug]] found in "herbal" [[aphrodisiac]] products, which is a novel nitrosated [[analog (chemistry)|analogue]] of [[sildenafil]] (Viagra). It has an innovative structure which acts as a [[prodrug]], breaking down in the body to release both the [[cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5|PDE<sub>5</sub>]] inhibitor [[aildenafil]] as well as free [[nitric oxide]], which have powerfully synergistic effects. This dual mechanism of action has never been exploited by conventional pharmaceutical companies because of the risks involved; usually combining [[PDE5 inhibitor|PDE<sub>5</sub> inhibitors]] with nitric oxide releasers like [[amyl nitrite]] is contraindicated as it can cause a precipitous drop in blood pressure that can potentially result in death. [[Nitrosamine]]s are also generally avoided in drug development as they can often be [[hepatotoxic]], so while the combined mechanisms of action are likely to be effective, this drug also has severe risks of toxicity.<ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Venhuis, B.

Shortly after Venhuis et al. published the suggested structure for nitrosoprodenafil, it was contested by Demizu et al. who suggested the structure was an [[azathioprine]]/aildenafil hybrid.<ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Demizu, Y. |author2=Wakana, D. |author3=Kamakure, H. |author4=Kurehara, M. |author5=Okuda, M. |author6=Goda, Y. | title = Identification of Mutaprodenafil in a Dietary Supplement and its Subsequent Synthesis | journal = Chem. Pharm. Bull.| year = 2011 | volume = 59 | pages = 1314–1316 | doi=10.1248/cpb.59.1314}}</ref> This newly suggested structure was dubbed 'mutaprodenafil' because  of the structural similarity with the [[mutagenic]] [[azathioprine]].

The final confirmation of the azathioprine/aildenafil hybrid was provided by Sakamoto et al. who prepared crystals for X-ray analysis.<ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Sakamoto, M. |author2=Moriyasu, T. |author3=Minowa, K. |author4=Kishimoto, K. |author5=Kadoi, H. |author6=Hamano, T. |author7=Fukaya, H. | title = Structure Elucidation of a Novel Analog of Sildenafil Detected as an Adulterant in a Dietary Supplement Using LC-UV and LC/MS | journal = Journal of AOAC International | year = 2012 | volume = 95 | issue = 4 | pages = 1048–1052 | doi=10.5740/jaoacint.11-235}}</ref> Although Sakamoto et al. support the name 'mutaprodenafil', they prefer to use 'nitrosoprodenafil' instead.
