'''Medetomidine''' is a synthetic drug used as both a surgical [[anesthetic]] and [[analgesic]].  It is often used as the [[hydrochloride]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]], medetomidine hydrochloride, a crystalline white solid.  It is an α2 [[adrenergic agonist]]<ref name="pmid14664351">{{cite journal |author=Sinclair MD |title=A review of the physiological effects of alpha2-agonists related to the clinical use of medetomidine in small animal practice |journal=Can.

The drug has been developed by [[Orion Pharma]].<ref>http://orion.fi/en/Research-and-developement/Achievements/  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315082255/http://orion.fi/en/Research-and-developement/Achievements/ |date=March 15, 2013 }}</ref> It is currently approved for dogs in the United States, and distributed in the United States by [[Pfizer]] Animal Health and by [[Novartis]] Animal Health in Canada under the product name '''Domitor'''.  Other alpha-two agonists used in veterinary medicine include [[xylazine]] and [[detomidine]], but their use is less common in small animal surgery.  The marketed product is a [[racemic mixture]] of two [[stereoisomer]]s; [[dexmedetomidine]] is the isomer with more useful effects, and is now marketed as Dexdomitor.

The free base form of medetomidine is distributed by the Swedish company I-Tech AB under the product name '''Selektope''' for use as an antifouling substance in marine paints.

==Uses==

===In veterinary medicine===
It is often used in combinations with opioids ([[butorphanol]], [[buprenorphine]] etc.) as premedication (before a [[general anesthetic]]) in healthy cats and dogs.  It can be given by [[intramuscular injection]] (IM), [[subcutaneous injection]] (SC) or [[intravenous injection]] (IV). When delivered intravenously, a significantly decreased dose is used.  Some authors suggest a [[sublingual]] route is also effective.  It is not recommended for diabetics, it is contraindicated in patients with cardiac disease.
Due to its potent sedative effects it is commonly used in more aggressive animals, where a drug combination with a lesser effect (such as [[acepromazine]] plus an [[opioid]], or  an opioid plus a [[benzodiazepine]]) would not allow the administration of the inductive agent without risk to the veterinarian.  As such the use of alpha-two agonists is only recommended in healthy animals.

Following administration, marked peripheral [[vasoconstriction]] and [[bradycardia]] are noted.  Often the dosage of induction agents (e.g. [[propofol]]) may be drastically reduced, as may the volumes of anasthetic gases (i.e. [[halothane]], [[isoflurane]], [[sevoflurane]]) used to maintain general anesthesia.

It is sometimes used in combination with butorphanol and [[ketamine]] (given IM) to produce general anasthesia for short periods in healthy but fractious felines that will not allow an intravenous induction agent to be given.  It provides a good degree of muscle relaxation, an important factor in ketamine based anethesia protocols.

Medetomidine has also been used in combination with [[morphine]] (or [[methadone]]), [[lidocaine]] and ketamine in constant rate infusion analgesia in canines.  It is often used in so called [[Microdosing|microdoses]] for this analgesic effect.

It is thought that this family of drugs has a degree of analgesic action, though this is, in comparison to the sedative effect, minor.

===In marine paint===
Medetomidine can be used as an [[antifouling]] substance in marine paint. It is mainly effective against [[barnacles]], but has also shown effect on other hard fouling like [[Tube worm (body plan)|tube worms]]. When the barnacle cyprid larva encounters a surface containing medetomidine the molecule interacts with the [[octopamine receptor]] in the larva. This makes the larva legs start kicking and it cannot settle to the painted surface. When the larva swims away from the surface, the effect disappears (reversible effect). The larva regain its function and can settle somewhere else.

==Reversal of effects==
Its effects can be reversed using [[atipamezole]] (distributed as Antisedan by Pfizer). IV use of atipamezole is not licensed, IM is the preferred route.  [[Yohimbine]] may also be used in an emergency situation, but is not licensed.
