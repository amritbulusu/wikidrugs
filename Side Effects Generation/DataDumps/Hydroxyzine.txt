'''Hydroxyzine''', sold under the brand names '''Atarax''' and '''Vistaril''' among others, is a [[first-generation antihistamine]]. It was first [[chemical synthesis|synthesized]] by [[Union Chimique Belge]] in 1956 and was marketed by [[Pfizer]] in the [[United States]] later the same year,<ref name="isbn0-19-536874-6">{{cite book | author = Shorter, Edward | title = Before Prozac: the troubled history of mood disorders in psychiatry | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford [Oxfordshire] | year = 2009 | pages = | isbn = 0-19-536874-6 | oclc = | doi = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8VaYF8pIPxgC&lpg=PR13&dq=hydroxyzine%201956&pg=PR13#v=onepage&q}}</ref> and is still widely used today.

Because of its [[antihistamine]] effects it can be used for the treatment of severe cases of [[itch]]ing, [[hyperalgesia]] and [[motion sickness]]-induced [[nausea]]; it has also been used in some cases to relieve the effects of [[opioid withdrawal]].<ref>FDA DrugInfo: http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/archives/fdaDrugInfo.cfm?archiveid=51459</ref><ref name="urlHydroxyzine Facts and Comparisons at Drugs.com">{{cite web | url = http://www.drugs.com/cdi/hydroxyzine.html | title = Hydroxyzine Facts and Comparisons at Drugs.com | work = | accessdate = }}</ref> Even though it is an effective [[sedative]], [[hypnotic]], and [[anxiolytic]], it shares virtually none of the [[drug abuse|abuse]], [[drug dependence|dependence]], [[drug addiction|addiction]], and [[toxicity]] potential of other drugs used for the same range of therapeutic reasons. Hydroxyzine has also been used to potentiate the analgesia of opioids and to alleviate some of their side effects, such as itching, nausea, and vomiting.

Due to its antagonistic effects on several [[receptor antagonist|receptor systems]] in the brain, hydroxyzine also has [[anxiolytic]], [[obsessive–compulsive disorder|antiobsessive]], and [[antipsychotic]] activity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=SCHRAM|first1=WS|title=Use of hydroxyzine in psychosis.|journal=Diseases of the Nervous System|date=March 1959|volume=20|issue=3|pages=126–9|pmid=13639831}}</ref> Today it is used primarily for the symptomatic relief of [[anxiety]] and [[tension (psychological)|tension]] associated with [[psychoneurosis]] and as an adjunct in organic disease states in which [[anxiety]] is manifested.

Other drugs related to hydroxyzine are [[cyclizine]], [[buclizine]], and [[meclizine]], and they share all or most of the benefits, indications, contraindications, cautions, and side effects of hydroxyzine. The second-generation antihistamine [[cetirizine]] is in fact one of the [[metabolite]]s of hydroxyzine produced in the human body. Unlike hydroxyzine, cetirizine is not reported to appreciably cross the [[blood-brain barrier]], but it has been reported to be associated with dystonic reactions as well as sedation. Therefore, it has a narrower spectrum of effects, making it an effective antihistamine but removing some or all of the anxiolytic and other psychoactive properties, but it may cause dystonic reactions and drowsiness in some patients.

==Medical uses==
Hydroxyzine is classified as an [[antihistamine]] and [[anxiolytic]] and is also used as a [[tranquilizer]]; especially common in dentistry and less so in medicine, where for many years it has been preferred in combination with opioids due to its ability to counteract the side effects of opioid pain medications, namely itchiness and nausea, and the fact that its sedative properties complement the pain relieving effects of opioids. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Hydroxyzine is prescribed when the onset of an organic disease state manifests through anxiety, as [[generalized anxiety disorder]], or in other more serious cases as [[neurosis|psychoneurosis]], and is therefore prescribed as a means of regulating normal function. Hydroxyzine has shown to be as effective as the [[benzodiazepine]] drug [[bromazepam]] in the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Llorca PM |title=Efficacy and safety of hydroxyzine in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder: a 3-month double-blind study |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=63 |issue=11 |pages=1020–7 |date=November 2002 |pmid=12444816 |doi= 10.4088/JCP.v63n1112|url=http://www.psychiatrist.com/privatepdf/2002/v63n11/v63n1112.pdf|name-list-format=vanc|author2= Spadone C |author3= Sol O  |displayauthors=etal  }}</ref> However, a [[systematic review]] concluded that compared with other anxiolytic agents ([[benzodiazepines]] and [[buspirone]]), hydroxyzine was equivalent in efficacy, acceptability and tolerability, however there is insufficient evidence to recommend it as a treatment for generalised anxiety disorder due to the high risk of bias in the reviewed studies.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Hydroxyzine for generalised anxiety disorder|author=Giuseppe Guaiana1, Corrado Barbui, Andrea Cipriani |journal=The Cochrane Library. Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group |date= 8 December 2010|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006815.pub2}}</ref>

Hydroxyzine can also be used for the treatment of [[allergy|allergic conditions]], such as chronic [[urticaria]], [[atopic dermatitis|atopic]] or [[contact dermatitis|contact dermatoses]], and [[histamine]]-mediated [[pruritus]]. These have also been confirmed in both recent and past studies to have no adverse effects on the liver, blood, nervous system or urinary tract.<ref name="fda_vistaril">''United States Food & Drug Administration'', (2004), p1</ref>{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Use of hydroxyzine for [[premedication]] as a sedative has no effects on tropane alkaloids, such as [[atropine]], but may, following general anesthesia, potentiate [[pethidine|meperidine]] and [[barbiturate]]s, and use in pre-anesthetic adjunctive therapy should be modified depending upon the state of the individual.<ref name="fda_vistaril" /> {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In other cases, the usage of hydroxyzine is as a form of non-barbiturate tranquilizer<ref name="calif_dolan">''Dolan, C. M.,'' (1958)</ref> used in the pre-operative sedation and treatment of neurological disorders, such as psychoneurosis and other forms of anxiety or tension states.<ref name="calif_dolan" />

For dentistry and obstetrics as well as other surgeries and procedures and acute pain situations like accidents, hydroxyzine is useful as a first line anxiolytic and opioid adjunct because it lacks both antagonism and synergy with [[benzodiazepines]] and [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]], allowing either of these agents to be used simultaneously or later in the procedure if need be.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Contraindications==
The administration of hydroxyzine in large amounts by ingestion or intramuscular administration during the onset of pregnancy can cause fetal abnormalities—when administered to pregnant rats, mice and rabbits, hydroxyzine caused abnormalities such as hypogonadism with doses significantly above that of the human therapeutic range.<ref name="fda_vistaril_2">''United States Food & Drug Administration'', (2004), p2</ref> In humans, a significant dose has not yet been established in studies, and by default, the [[Food and drug administration|FDA]] has introduced contraindication guidelines in regard to hydroxyzine.<ref name="fda_vistaril_2" /> Similarly the use in those at risk from or showing previous signs of [[hypersensitivity]] is also contraindicated.<ref name="fda_vistaril_2" /> Hydroxyzine is contraindicated for intravenous (IV) injection, as it has shown to cause [[hemolysis]].

Other contraindications include the administration of hydroxyzine alongside depressants and other compounds which affect the central nervous system.<ref name="fda_vistaril_2" /> and if absolutely necessary, it should only be administered concomitantly in small doses.<ref name="fda_vistaril_2" /> If administered in small doses with other substances, such as mentioned, then patients should refrain from using dangerous machinery, motor vehicles or any other practice requiring absolute concentration, in accordance with safety law.<ref name="fda_vistaril_2" />

Studies have also been conducted which show that long-term prescription of hydroxyzine can lead to [[tardive dyskinesia]] after years of use, but effects related to dyskinesia have also anecdotally been reported after periods of 7.5 months,<ref name="clark_phen">Clark, B. G., Araki, M., et al. (1976)</ref> such as continual head rolling, lip licking and other forms of [[athetoid]] movement. In certain cases, elderly patients' previous interactions with [[phenothiazine]] derivatives or pre-existing neuroleptic treatment may have had some contribution towards dyskinesia at the administration of hydroxyzine due to hypersensitivity caused due to the prolonged treatment,<ref name="clark_phen" /> and therefore some contraindication is given to the short-term administration of hydroxyzine to those with previous phenothiazine use.<ref name="clark_phen" />

==Side effects==
Several reactions have been noted in manufacturer guidelines — deep sleep, incoordination, sedation, calmness, and dizziness have been reported in children and adults, as well as others such as [[hypotension]], [[tinnitus]], and headaches.<ref name="manufact_sa">UCB South-Africa, et al., (2004)</ref> [[Gastro-intestinal]] effects have also been observed, as well as less serious effects such as dryness of the mouth and constipation caused by the mild [[antimuscarinic]] properties of hydroxyzine.<ref name="manufact_sa" />

Central nervous system problems such as hallucinations or confusion have been observed in rare cases, attributed mostly to overdosage.<ref name="fda_vistaril_3" /><ref name="manufact_sa" />  Such properties have been attributed to hydroxyzine in several cases, particularly in patients treated for neuropsychological disorders, as well as in cases where overdoses have been observed. While there are reports of the "hallucinogenic" or "hypnotic" properties of hydroxyzine, several clinical data trials have not reported such side effects from the sole consumption of hydroxyzine, but rather, have described its overall calming effect described through the stimulation of areas within the [[formatio reticularis]]. The hallucinogenic or hypnotic properties have been described as being an additional effect from overall [[central nervous system]] suppression by other CNS agents, such as [[Lithium pharmacology|lithium]] or [[ethanol]].<ref>''Anderson, P. O., Knoben, J. E., et al.'' (2002), p794-796</ref>

The effect of hydroxyzine has also been tested on the ability of humans in the registration and storage of memory, and was used in comparison with relatively safe drugs, such as lorazepam, to illustrate the effects of benzodiazepines, which are thought to have adverse effects on the capacity of memory storage. Hydroxyzine was found to have no adverse effects on memory in relation to [[lorazepam]], which caused several deficiencies in the capacity of memory storage.<ref name="brabander_p1">Brabander, A. DE, Debert, W., (1990), p1</ref>

In a comparative study with lorazepam on memory effects, patients who had taken hydroxyzine experienced sedative effects like drowsiness, but recalled that they felt capable, attentive and able to continue with a memory test under these conditions.<ref name="brabander_p3">Brabander, A. DE, Debert, W., (1990), p3</ref>  Conversely, those under the effects of lorazepam felt unable to continue due to the fact they felt out of control with its effects; 8 out of 10 patients describing tendencies of problems with balance and control of simple motor functions.<ref name="brabander_p3" />

[[Somnolence]] with or without vivid dreams or nightmares may occur in users with antihistamine sensitivities in combination with other CNS depressants. Hydroxyzine exhibits [[anxiolytic]] and [[sedative]] properties in many psychiatric patients. Other studies have suggested that hydroxyzine acts as an acute hypnotic, reducing [[sleep onset latency]] and increasing sleep duration — also showing that some drowsiness did occur. This was observed more in female patients, who also had greater hypnotic response.<ref name="hydroxy_sleep">Alford, C.; N. Rombautt, J. Jones, S. Foley, C. Idzikowskit and I. Hindmarch (1992).</ref>

Because of potential for more severe side effects, this drug is on the list to avoid in the elderly.<ref>NCQA’s HEDIS Measure: Use of High Risk Medications in the Elderly, {{cite web|url=http://www.ncqa.org/Portals/0/Newsroom/SOHC/Drugs_Avoided_Elderly.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201113909/http://www.ncqa.org/Portals/0/Newsroom/SOHC/Drugs_Avoided_Elderly.pdf |archivedate=2010-02-01 |df= }}</ref>

In 2015, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) announced a small but definite risk of QT prolongation associated with the use of hydroxyzine.
This side effect is more likely to occur in people with pre-existing cardiac disease, or with the use of other medicines known to prolong the QT interval.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Hydroxyzine can be administered orally or via intramuscular injection. When given orally, hydroxyzine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The effect of hydroxyzine is notable in 30 minutes.

[[Pharmacokinetics|Pharmacokinetically]], hydroxyzine is rapidly absorbed and distributed in oral and intramuscular administration, and is metabolized in the liver; the main metabolite (45%), [[cetirizine]], is formed through oxidation of the alcohol moiety to a carboxylic acid by [[alcohol dehydrogenase]], and overall effects are observed within one hour of administration. Higher concentrations are found in the skin than in the plasma. Cetirizine, although less sedating, is non-[[dialysis|dialyzable]] and possesses similar anti-histaminergic properties. The other metabolites identified include a ''N''-dealkylated metabolite, and an ''O''-dealkylated 1/16 metabolite with a plasma half-life of 59 hours. These pathways are mediated principally by [[CYP3A4]] and [[CYP3A5]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ucerax (hydroxyzine hydrochloride) 25 mg film-coated tablets. Summary of product characteristics|url=http://www.imb.ie/images/uploaded/swedocuments/LicenseSPC_PA0891-005-001_16082013162208.pdf|publisher=Irish Medicines Board|accessdate=9 February 2014}}</ref> "In animals, hydroxyzine and its metabolites are excreted in feces via biliary elimination."<ref>[http://www.medscape.com/druginfo/monograph?cid=med&drugid=6144&drugname=Vistaril+Oral&monotype=monograph&print=1] "The extent of renal excretion of VISTARIL has not been determined"[http://www.pfizer.com/pfizer/download/uspi_vistaril.pdf]</ref>

Administration in geriatrics differs from the administration of hydroxyzine in younger patients; according to the FDA, there have not been significant studies made (2004), which include population groups over 65, which provide a distinction between elderly aged patients and other younger groups. Hydroxyzine should be administered carefully in the elderly with consideration given to possible reduced elimination.<ref name="fda_vistaril_3">''United States Food & Drug Administration'', (2004), p3</ref>

Similarly, the use of sedating drugs alongside hydroxyzine can cause oversedation and confusion if administered in large amounts—any form of treatment alongside sedatives should be done under supervision of a doctor.<ref name="calif_dolan" /><ref name="fda_vistaril_3" />

The [[Tmax (pharmacology)|T<sub>max</sub>]] of hydroxyzine is about 2.0&nbsp;hours in both adults and children and its [[elimination half-life]] is around 20.0&nbsp;hours in adults and 7.1&nbsp;hours in children.<ref name="pmid2866055">{{cite journal | vauthors = Paton DM, Webster DR | title = Clinical pharmacokinetics of H1-receptor antagonists (the antihistamines) | journal = Clin Pharmacokinet | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 477–97 | year = 1985 | pmid = 2866055 | doi = | url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid6141198" /> Another study found that the elimination half-life of hydroxyzine in adults was as short as 3&nbsp;hours, but this may have simply been due to methodological limitations.<ref name="Kacew1989">{{cite book|author=Sam Kacew|title=Drug Toxicity & Metabolism In Pediatrics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3eruIjPYbC8C&pg=PA257|date=30 November 1989|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-4564-7|pages=257–}}</ref>
