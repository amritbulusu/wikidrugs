===Biosynthesis===
Estrone is [[biosynthesis|biosynthesized]] from [[cholesterol]]. The principal pathway involves [[androstenedione]] as an [[metabolic intermediate|intermediate]], with androstenedione being [[biotransformation|transformed]] into estrone by the [[enzyme]] [[aromatase]]. This reaction occurs in both the [[gonad]]s and in certain other [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s, particularly [[adipose tissue]], and estrone is subsequently [[secretion|secreted]] from these tissues.<ref name="HornsteinSchwerin2012" /> In addition to aromatization of androstenedione, estrone is also formed [[reversible reaction|reversibly]] from estradiol by the enzyme [[17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]] (17β-HSD) in various tissues, including the [[liver]], [[uterus]], and [[mammary gland]].<ref name="pmid16112947" />

===Distribution===
Estrone is bound approximately 16% to [[sex hormone-binding globulin]] (SHBG) and 80% to [[human serum albumin|albumin]] in the [[circulatory system|circulation]],<ref name="pmid16112947" /> with the remainder (2.0 to 4.0%) circulating freely or unbound.<ref name="JamesonGroot2010">{{cite book|author1=J.

===Metabolism===
Estrone is [[conjugation (biochemistry)|conjugated]] into [[estrogen conjugate]]s such as [[estrone sulfate]] and [[estrone glucuronide]] by [[sulfotransferase]]s and [[glucuronidase]]s, and can also be [[hydroxylation|hydroxylated]] by [[cytochrome P450]] enzymes into [[catechol estrogen]]s such as [[2-hydroxyestrone]] and [[4-hydroxyestrone]] or into [[estriol]].<ref name="pmid16112947" /> Both of these transformations take place predominantly in the [[liver]].<ref name="pmid16112947" /> Estrone can also be reversibly converted into estradiol by 17β-HSD.<ref name="pmid16112947" />

==Medical use==
Estrone was previously marketed in [[intramuscular injection|intramuscular]] and [[vaginal administration|vaginal]] formulations and was used in the treatment of [[symptom]]s of [[hypoestrogenism]] such as [[hot flash]]es and [[atrophic vaginitis]] in [[menopause|menopausal]] or [[ovariectomy|ovariectomized]] women.<ref name="pmid18744783" /> It has since been discontinued and is no longer available, having been superseded by other estrogens with greater [[potency (pharmacology)|potency]] and improved [[pharmacokinetics]] (namely [[oral administration|oral]] [[bioavailability]] and [[duration of action|duration]]).<ref name="FDA">http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=overview.process&varApplNo=003977</ref> Although estrone itself is no longer used medically, other marketed estrogens such as [[estradiol]] and [[estrone sulfate]] produce estrone as a major [[metabolite]].<ref name="pmid16112947" />

==Chemistry==
Estrone, also known as '''estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3-ol-17-one''', is a [[natural product|naturally occurring]] [[estrane]] [[steroid]] with [[double bond]]s at the C1, C3, and C5 positions, a [[hydroxyl group]] at the C3 position, and a [[ketone]] [[functional group|group]] at the C17 position. The name ''estrone'' was derived from the chemical terms ''[[estrin (compound)|'''estr'''in]]'' (estra-1,3,5(10)-triene) and ''ket'''one'''''.

The [[chemical formula]] of estrone is C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and its [[molecular weight]] is 270.366&nbsp;g/mol. It is a white, odorless, [[solid]] [[crystalline]] [[powder (substance)|powder]], with a [[melting point]] of 254.5&nbsp;°C (490&nbsp;°F) and a [[specific gravity]] of 1.23.<ref name=science1 /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=5870&loc=ec_rcs|title=Estrone -PubChem|publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information|accessdate=2009-09-06}}</ref> Estrone is [[combustion|combustible]] at high temperatures, with the products [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) and [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>).<ref name=science1>{{cite web|title=Material Safety Data Sheet Estrone|url=http://www.hmdb.ca/system/metabolites/msds/000/000/100/original/HMDB00145.pdf?1358894245|publisher=ScienceLab.com|accessdate=21 February 2013}}</ref>
