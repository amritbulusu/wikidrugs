'''Dicycloverine''', also known as '''dicyclomine''', is a [[prescription drug|prescription medication]] that relieves [[muscle spasm]]s in the [[gastrointestinal tract]] through an apparent mechanism of nonselective [[smooth muscle]] relaxation, and that presents a range of [[anticholinergic]] side effects. It was first synthesized in the United States ''circa'' 1945.

In the UK, it is an ingredient of a multiple-ingredient preparation, with an [[antiflatulent]] ([[simethicone]]) and two [[antacids]], under the trade name [[Kolanticon]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} In India, it is of a compound with [[paracetamol]] under the trade name Cyclopam.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} It is also marketed as Meftal-SPAS containing [[mefenamic acid]] along with dicyclomine hydrochloride as an [[analgesic]] and [[antispasmodic]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Also it is a part of [[Normaxin]] containing two other salts [[clidinium bromide]] and [[chlordiazepoxide]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Side effects==
Dicycloverine can cause a range of anticholinergic side effects such as [[dry mouth]], [[nausea]],<ref name=mono/>  and, at higher doses, [[deliriant]] effects.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Recreational use of this drug for its anticholinergic effects (both low dose for euphoria and high dose for delirium) has been rarely reported.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Precautions===
Because dicycloverine is known to "impair mental alertness or physical coordination", those taking the drug should "avoid driving or operating machinery until effect on [the] individual are known".<ref name=mono/> It is also important that women inform their clinicians "if they are or plan to become pregnant or plan to breast-feed".<ref name=mono/> <!--"Breastfeeding is not recommended while using this drug."

Dicycloverine was first [[chemical synthesis|synthesized chemically]] in the United States ''circa'' 1945 (with patent from Wm S Merrell Company filed in January 1946, presentation at the September 1946 meeting of the Medicinal Chemistry Section of the [[American Chemical Society|A.C.S.]], and publication of the preparation in that Society's journal in November 1947).<ref name=Tildford>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja01203a077| title = Aminoesters of Substituted Alicylic Carboxylic Acids| journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society| volume = 69| issue = 11| pages = 2902â€“2906| year = 1947| last1 = Tilford | first1 = C.

The discovery synthesis came in the preparation of a family of [[Ester#Protecting groups|aminoester]]s of 1-substituted [[cycloalkane]]-[[carboxylic acid]]s, and proceeded for this specific compound (see scheme) via "condensation" (double alkylation) of [[phenylacetonitrile]] with 1,5-dibromopentane in the presence of [[sodamide]] (NaNH<sub>2</sub>) dissolved in [[diethyl ether]]-[[liquid ammonia]] at low-temperature, which gave the 1,1-disubstituted cyclohexane[[nitrile]]. [[Alcoholysis]] of that nitrile in ethanol (EtOH) and sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) gave the corresponding [[carboxylic acid ester|carboxylic acid ethyl ester]], which was [[transesterification|transesterified]] as its [[Water purification|crude mixture]] in [[toluene]] or [[xylene]] with [[diethylethanolamine|2-(diethylamino)ethanol]] [a sodium (Na)-catalysed reaction]. [[Catalytic hydrogenation]] using hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) over [[Adam's catalyst]] (PtO<sub>2</sub>, abbreviated here PtO) in [[acetic acid]] reduced the aromatic ring of the original phenylacetonitrile the corresponding second cyclohexane ring,<ref>The generation of Adam's catalyst in this situation is inferred; see {{cite book |author1=Norman, Richard O.C.  |author2=Coxon, James M. | date = 1993 | title = Principles of Organic Synthesis | edition = 3rd | location = Boca Raton, FL | publisher = CRC Press | isbn = 0748761624 | page = 631 and ''passim'' }} The involvement of [[transfer hydrogenation]] is not ruled out by the primary source description.</ref> to give the final drug.<ref name=Tildford/>{{primary source inline|date=November 2016}}
