==Side effects==
Propylthiouracil is generally well tolerated, with side effects occurring in one of every 100 patients.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The most common side effects are related to the skin, and include rash, itching, hives, abnormal hair loss, and skin pigmentation.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Other common side effects are swelling, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, loss of taste, joint or muscle aches, numbness and headache, allergic reactions, and hair whitening.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Its notable side effects include a risk of [[agranulocytosis]] and [[aplastic anemia]]. On 3 June 2009, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|FDA]] published an alert "notifying healthcare professionals of the risk of serious liver injury, including liver failure and death, with the use of propylthiouracil."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/DrugSafetyInformationforHeathcareProfessionals/ucm162701.htm|title=Propylthiouracil (PTU)-Induced Liver Failure|publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|FDA]]|accessdate=2009-05-03}}</ref> As a result, propylthiouracil is no longer recommended in non-pregnant adults and in children as the front line antithyroid medication.<ref name="FDA PTU Guidelines" />

One possible side effect is [[agranulocytosis]],<ref name="pmid16491833">{{cite journal |vauthors=Cho YY, Shon HS, Yoon HD |title=Management of a pregnant patient with Graves' disease complicated by propylthiouracil induced agranulocytosis |journal=The Korean Journal of Internal Medicine |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=335–8 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16491833 |doi= |url=http://www.kaim.or.kr/journal/view2.php?year=2005&vol=20&no=4&page=335}}</ref> a decrease of white blood cells in the blood. Symptoms and signs of agranulocytosis include infectious lesions of the throat, the gastrointestinal tract, and skin with an overall feeling of illness and fever. A decrease in blood platelets (thrombocytopenia) also may occur. Since platelets are important for the clotting of blood, thrombocytopenia may lead to problems with excessive bleeding. Side effects are suspected and the drug is sometimes discontinued if the patient complains of recurrent episodes of sore throat.

Other life-threatening side effect is sudden, severe, [[fulminant liver failure]] resulting in death or liver transplantation, which occurs in up to 1 in 10,000 people taking propylthiouracil. Unlike agranulocytosis which most commonly occurs in the first three months of therapy, this side effect may occur at any time during treatment.<ref name="FDA PTU Guidelines">{{cite journal | url = http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/thy.2009.0169 | pmid = 19583480 | doi=10.1089/thy.2009.0169 | volume=19 | issue=7 | title=The Role of Propylthiouracil in the Management of Graves' Disease in Adults: report of a meeting jointly sponsored by the American Thyroid Association and the Food and Drug Administration |date=July 2009 | journal=Thyroid | pages=673–4  |vauthors=Bahn RS, Burch HS, Cooper DS, etal }}</ref>

===Pregnancy===

Propylthiouracil is classified as [[Pregnancy category|Drug Class D in pregnancy]].  Class D signifies there is positive evidence of human fetal risk.  Maternal benefit may outweigh fetal risk in life-threatening situations.<ref name="Epocrates">{{cite web|url=https://online.epocrates.com/u/10a278?src=PK |title=propylthiouracil |publisher=Online.epocrates.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-29}}</ref> PTU is preferred over [[methimazole]] (which is also a class D) only in the first trimester of pregnancy and in women who may become pregnant because of the increased risk of teratogenicity of methimazole during critical organogenesis. In the second and third trimester, this risk is diminished and [[methimazole]] is preferred to avoid the risk of liver complications from PTU in the mother.<ref name="FDA PTU Guidelines" />

The primary effect on the fetus from transplacental passage of PTU is the production of a mild hypothyroidism when the drug is used close to term.  This usually resolves within a few days without treatment.  The hypothyroid state may be observed as a goiter in the newborn, and is the result of increased levels of fetal pituitary thyrotropin.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fumarola|first1=A|last2=Di Fiore|first2=A|last3=Dainelli|first3=M|last4=Grani|first4=G|last5=Carbotta|first5=G|last6=Calvanese|first6=A|title=Therapy of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy and breastfeeding.|journal=Obstetrical & gynecological survey|date=Jun 2011|volume=66|issue=6|pages=378–85|pmid=21851752|doi=10.1097/OGX.0b013e31822c6388}}</ref>  The incidence of fetal goiter after PTU treatment in reported cases is approximately 12%.<ref name="Drugs in Pregnancy and Lactation">{{cite web|url=http://drugsafetysite.com/propylthiouracil |title=Propylthiouracil: Drug safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding  |publisher=Drugsafetysite.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-29}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==

===Thyroid===
PTU inhibits the enzyme [[thyroperoxidase]], which normally acts in thyroid hormone synthesis by oxidizing the anion [[iodide]] (I<sup>−</sup>) to [[iodine]] (I<sup>0</sup>), facilitating iodine's addition to tyrosine residues on the hormone precursor [[thyroglobulin]].  This is one of the essential steps in the formation of [[thyroxine]] (T4).<ref>Boron, WF & Boulpaep, EL. 2005. ''Medical Physiology, Updated Edition.'' Elsevier Saunders, Philadelphia, PA</ref>

PTU does not inhibit the action of the [[sodium-dependent iodide transporter]] located on follicular cells' basolateral membranes. Inhibition of this step requires competitive inhibitors, such as [[perchlorate]] and [[thiocyanate]].

=== T3/T4 target tissues ===
PTU also acts by inhibiting the enzyme 5'-deiodinase ([[tetraiodothyronine 5' deiodinase]]), which converts T<sub>4</sub> to the more active form T<sub>3</sub>. (This is in contrast to [[methimazole]], which shares propylthiouracil's central mechanism, but not its peripheral one.)

It is important to recognize that these enzymes only work on the conjugated tyrosine molecules of T3 and T4: a completely different enzyme family is responsible for the deiodinase activity of iodized single tyrosine molecules within the thyroid follicular cells. For information on that enzyme family, see [[Iodotyrosine deiodinase]].

==Pharmacokinetics==
Administration is oral, with peak serum concentrations occurring in one hour, and actively concentrated to the thyroid gland. Depending on several patient variables, however, euthyroid status may not be achieved until 2–4 months after treatment initiation. Of note, the drug is approximately 70% protein-bound and significantly ionized at normal physiologic pH, while the antithyroid agent [[methimazole]] is substantially less protein bound. However both are equally transferred across the placenta.<ref name="ESCPG">{{cite journal | url = http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/content/full/92/8_suppl/s1?maxtoshow=&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&author1=abalovich&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&sortspec=relevance&resourcetype=HWCIT#SEC6 | pmid = 17948378 | volume=92 | issue=8 Suppl | title=Management of thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy and postpartum: an Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline |date=August 2007 | journal=J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. | pages=S1–47  |vauthors=Abalovich M, Amino N, Barbour LA, etal | doi=10.1210/jc.2007-0141}}</ref>

The plasma half-life is one hour and is not altered appreciably by the thyroid status of the patient. Due to the concentration in the thyroid, however, dosing intervals may last 8 hours or longer. Less than 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged, with the remaining fraction undergoing extensive hepatic metabolism via [[glucuronidation]].

==Chemical synthesis==
Propylthiouracil can be prepared from [[ethyl 3-oxohexanoate]] and [[thiourea]].<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1021/ja01228a042 | title=Studies in Chemotherapy. X. Antithyroid Compounds.
