'''Desmethylprodine''' or '''1-methyl-4-phenyl-4-propionoxypiperidine''' ('''MPPP, Ro 2-0718''') is an [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] drug developed in the 1940s by researchers at [[Hoffmann-La Roche]].<ref>{{US Patent|2765314}} - Preparation of Esters</ref> '''Desmethylprodine''' has been labeled by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] as a [[Schedule I (US)|Schedule I]] drug in the [[United States]]. It is an [[Analog (chemistry)|analog]] of [[pethidine]] (meperidine) a [[Schedule II (US)|Schedule II]] drug. Chemically, it is a reversed [[ester]] of pethidine which has about 70% of the potency of [[morphine]].  Unlike its derivative [[prodine]], it was not reported to exhibit optical isomerism.<ref name="Randall, Morphine 1957 pp 310">Reynolds and Randall, Morphine & Allied Drugs (1957) pp 310</ref>  It was reported to have 30 times the activity of pethidine and a greater analgesic effect than morphine in rats, and it was demonstrated to cause central nervous system stimulation in mice.<ref name="Randall, Morphine 1957 pp 310"/>

==History==
Desmethylprodine was first synthesized in 1947 at Hoffman-LaRoche Laboratories by Albert Ziering and John Lee. They found that it produced effects similar to [[morphine]] when administered to rats.<ref>{{Cite journal

It was found to be no more effective than pethidine and was never marketed.<ref name=Schwarcz>{{cite journal | url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Aim+high%3A+synthetic+opiates+deliver+surprising+side+effects.-a0151434502 | title=Aim high: synthetic opiates deliver surprising side effects | author=Schwarcz, Joe | journal=Canadian Chemical News | year=2005 | volume=57 | issue=10 | pages=10}}</ref>  This research produced the analgesic [[alphaprodine]] (Nisentil, Prisilidine), a very closely related compound.<ref name="Randall, Morphine 1957 pp 310"/>

In 1976, a 23-year-old graduate student in chemistry named Barry Kidston was searching for a way to make a legal recreational drug. Having read the paper by Ziering and Lee, he deduced that he could make a drug with pethidine's effects without its legal restrictions, since desmethylprodine is a different molecule and had never been addressed by law. Kidston successfully synthesized and used desmethylprodine for several months, after which he suddenly came down with the symptoms of [[Parkinson's disease]] and was hospitalized. Physicians were perplexed, since Parkinson's disease would be a great rarity in someone so young, but [[L-dopa]], the standard drug for Parkinson's, relieved his symptoms. L-dopa is a precursor for dopamine, the neurotransmitter whose lack produces Parkinson's symptoms. It was later found that his development of Parkinson's was due to a common impurity in the synthesis of MPPP called [[MPTP|MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)]], a neurotoxin that specifically targets dopamine producing neurons.<ref name=Schwarcz /><ref name=Gibb>Gibb, Barry J. (2007).

In the United States, MPPP is now in Schedule I of the [[Controlled Substances Act]] with a zero aggregate manufacturing quota as of 2014.  The free base conversion ratio for salts includes 0.87 for the hydrochloride.<ref>http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/quotas/2014/fr0825.htm</ref>  It is listed under the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] and is controlled in most countries in the same fashion as is morphine.

===Toxic impurity===
The intermediate [[tertiary alcohol]] is liable to dehydration in acidic conditions if the reaction temperature rises above 30&nbsp;°C. Kidston did not realize this and esterified the intermediate with [[propionic anhydride]] at an elevated temperature. Consequently, [[MPTP]] was formed as a major impurity.<ref>{{Cite journal
