'''Phenmetrazine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]]) (brand name '''Preludin''', and [[Phenmetrazine#Brand names|many others]]) is a [[stimulant]] [[drug]] that was previously used as an [[appetite suppressant]], but has since been withdrawn from the market. It was initially replaced by its [[Structural analog|analogue]] [[phendimetrazine]] which functions as a [[prodrug]] to phenmetrazine, but now it is rarely prescribed, due to concerns of [[drug abuse|abuse]] and [[drug addiction|addiction]]. Chemically, phenmetrazine is a [[substituted amphetamine]] with a [[morpholine]] ring.

== History ==
Phenmetrazine was first patented in [[Germany]] in 1952 by [[Boehringer-Ingelheim]],<ref>{{cite news| first1= Albert| last1= Boehringer| first2= Ernst | last2= Boehringer| title= Improvements in or relating to the preparation of substituted morpholines| number= GB773780}}</ref><ref>{{cite patent| url= http://www.google.com/patents/US2835669 |country= US| status= Patent |title= Process for the Production of Substituted Morpholines | number= 2835669 | via= google.com| gdate= May 20, 1958| fdate= June 29, 1953| invent1= Otto Thoma| assign1= C.

== Medical use ==

== Pharmacology ==
Phenmetrazine acts as a [[releasing agent]] of [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]] with [[EC50|EC<sub>50</sub>]] values of 50.4 ± 5.4 nM and 131 ± 11 nM, respectively.<ref name="pmid17017961">{{cite journal |vauthors=Rothman RB, Baumann MH | title = Therapeutic potential of monoamine transporter substrates | journal = Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 6 | issue = 17 | pages = 1845–59 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17017961 | doi = 10.2174/156802606778249766| url = http://www.bentham-direct.org/pages/content.php?CTMC/2006/00000006/00000017/0004R.SGM}}</ref> It has negligible efficacy as a releaser of [[serotonin]], with an EC<sub>50</sub> value of only 7,765 ± 610 nM.<ref name="pmid17017961"/>

After an oral dose, about 70% of the drug is [[Excretion|excreted]] from the body within 24 hours. About 19% of that is excreted as the unmetabolised drug and the rest as various [[metabolite]]s.<ref name=clarkes>{{cite book| title=Clarke's Analysis of Drugs and Poisons| author=Anthony C Moffat, M David Osselton and Brian Widdop| isbn=0-85369-473-7}}</ref>

In trials performed on rats, it has been found that after [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous]] administration of phenmetrazine, both [[optical isomer]]s are equally effective in reducing food intake, but in [[mouth|oral]] administration the [[Levorotation|levo]] isomer is more effective. In terms of central stimulation however, the dextro isomer is about 4 times as effective in both methods of administration.<ref name=engelhardt>{{cite journal| title=Studies of the Mechanism of the Anti-Appetite Action of Phenmetrazine| author=Engelhardt, A| journal=Biochem. Pharmacol.| volume=8| issue=1| pages=100| year=1961| doi=10.1016/0006-2952(61)90520-2}}</ref>

==Chemistry==
{{Expand section|1=details of the synthesis from US patent [https://www.google.com/patents/US3018222 US3018222]|date=January 2015}}
Its structure incorporates the backbone of [[amphetamine]], the prototypical CNS stimulant which, like phenmetrazine, is a releasing agent of dopamine and norepinephrine. The molecule also loosely resembles [[ethcathinone]], the active metabolite of popular anorectic [[amfepramone]] (diethylpropion). Unlike phenmetrazine, ethcathinone (and therefore amfepramone as well) are mostly selective as noradrenaline releasing agents.

== Recreational use ==
Phenmetrazine has been used recreationally in many countries, for example [[Sweden]]. When stimulant use first became prevalent in Sweden in the 1950s, phenmetrazine was preferred to [[amphetamine]] and [[methamphetamine]] by users.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/LIBRARY/studies/cu/CU39.html| title=The Swedish Experience| author=Brecher, Edward M| accessdate=2009-10-31}}</ref> In the autobiographical novel ''Rush'' by [[Kim Wozencraft]], intravenous phenmetrazine is described as the most euphoric and pro-sexual of the stimulants the author used.

Phenmetrazine was classified as a [[narcotic]] in Sweden in 1959, and was taken completely off the market in 1965. At first the illegal demand was satisfied by smuggling from [[Germany]], and later [[Spain]] and [[Italy]]. At first, Preludin tablets were smuggled, but soon the smugglers started bringing in raw phenmetrazine powder. Eventually amphetamine became the dominant stimulant of abuse because of its greater availability.

Phenmetrazine was taken by [[the Beatles]] early in their career. [[Paul McCartney]] was one known user. McCartney's introduction to drugs started in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]]. The Beatles had to play for hours, and they were often given the drug (referred to as ''Prellies'') by the maid who cleaned their housing arrangements, German customers, or by [[Astrid Kirchherr]] (whose mother bought them). McCartney would usually take one, but [[John Lennon]] would often take four or five.<ref name="Milesp66-67">{{cite book| last= Miles| first= Barry| title=Paul McCartney: Many Years from Now| year=1998 |pages=66–67| isbn=0-8050-5248-8}}</ref> [[Hunter Davies]] asserted, in his 1968 biography of the band,<ref name="Davies78">{{cite book| authorlink= Hunter Davies| last= Davies| first= Hunter| title=The Beatles: The Authorized Biography| year=1968 |page=78| isbn=0-07-015457-0}}</ref> that their use of such stimulants then was in response to their need to stay awake and keep working, rather than a simple desire for kicks.

[[Jack Ruby]] said he was on phenmetrazine at the time he killed [[Lee Harvey Oswald]].<ref>{{cite book| first= Jack| last= Ruby |title= Testimony of Jack Ruby| volume= 5| place= Washington| publisher= US Government Printing Office| year= 1964| pages= 198–99}}</ref>

Preludin was also used recreationally in the US throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. It could be crushed up in water, heated and injected. The street name for the drug in Washington, DC was "Bam".<ref>{{cite book | first= Leon| last= Dash | title = Rosa Lee | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 1996 | page = 109}}</ref> Phenmetrazine continues to be used and abused around the world, in countries including [[South Korea]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Choi H, Baeck S, Jang M, Lee S, Choi H, Chung H | title = Simultaneous analysis of psychotropic phenylalkylamines in oral fluid by GC-MS with automated SPE and its application to legal cases | journal = [[Forensic Science International]] | volume = 215 | issue = 1–3 | date = 10 February 2012 | pages = 81–87 | pmid= 21377815 | doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2011.02.011}}</ref>
