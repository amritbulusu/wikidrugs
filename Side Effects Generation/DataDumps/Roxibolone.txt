'''Roxibolone''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) (developmental code name '''BR-906'''), also known as '''11β,17β-dihydroxy-17α-methyl-3-oxoandrosta-1,4-diene-2-carboxylic acid''', is a [[steroid]]al [[antiglucocorticoid]] described as an [[lipid-lowering agent|anticholesterolemic]] ([[cholesterol]]-lowering) and [[anabolic]] [[drug]] which was never marketed.<ref name="Elks2014">{{cite book|author=J.

Unlike formebolone, which is additionally an [[anabolic-androgenic steroid]] (AAS), roxibolone is devoid of [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for the [[androgen receptor]] and possesses no [[androgen]]ic or [[myotrophic]] activity in [[animal research|animal]] [[bioassay|assay]]s.<ref name="pmid6523544" /> For this reason, it has been said that roxibolone may be much better tolerated in comparison.<ref name="pmid6523544" />
