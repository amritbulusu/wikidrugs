'''Zuclopenthixol''' (brand names '''Cisordinol''', '''Clopixol''', '''Acuphase'''), also known as '''zuclopentixol''', is a medication used to treat [[schizophrenia]] and other [[psychoses]]. It is classed, pharmacologically, as a [[typical antipsychotic]]. Chemically it is a [[thioxanthene]]. It is the ''[[cis-trans isomerism|cis]]''-[[isomer]] of [[clopenthixol]] (Sordinol, Ciatyl).<ref name="isbn0-471-89980-1">{{cite book | author = Sneader, Walter | title = Drug discovery: a history | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | year = 2005 | page = 410 | isbn = 0-471-89980-1 | oclc = | doi = | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Cb6BOkj9fK4C&lpg=PA410&pg=PA410#v=onepage}}</ref> Clopenthixol was introduced in 1961, while zuclopenthixol was introduced in 1978.<ref name="Publishing2013">{{cite book|author=William Andrew Publishing|title=Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_J2ti4EkYpkC&pg=PA1102|date=22 October 2013|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-8155-1856-3|pages=1102–}}</ref>

Zuclopenthixol is a [[Dopamine receptor|D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub>]] antagonist, [[adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic]] and [[serotonin receptor|5-HT<sub>2</sub>]] antagonist.

==Medical uses==

===Available forms===
Zuclopenthixol is available in three major [[drug form|preparation]]s:

* As '''zuclopenthixol decanoate''' ('''Clopixol'''), it is a long acting intramuscular injection. Its main use is as a long acting injection given every two or three weeks to people with [[schizophrenia]] who have a poor compliance with medication and suffer frequent relapses of illness.<ref name = "Cochzuclo2">{{cite web  |vauthors=da Silva Freire Coutinho E, Fenton M, Quraishi SN | title = Zuclopenthixol decanoate for schizophrenia | work = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | publisher = John Wiley and Sons, Ltd. | year = 1999 | url = http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab001164.html | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001164 | accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref> There is some evidence it may be more helpful in managing aggressive behaviour.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Haessler F, Glaser T, Beneke M, Pap AF, Bodenschatz R, Reis O | title = Zuclopenthixol in adults with intellectual disabilities and aggressive behaviours | journal = [[British Journal of Psychiatry]] | volume = 190 | issue = 5 | pages = 447&ndash;448 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.105.016535 | pmid = 17470962 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>
* As '''zuclopenthixol acetate''' ('''Clopixol''', '''Acuphase''', '''Cisordinol-Acutard'''), it is a shorter acting intramuscular injection used in the acute sedation of psychotic inpatients. The effect peaks at 48–72 hours providing 2–3 days of sedation.<ref>{{cite web | author = Lundbeck P/L | title = Clopixol Acuphase  50 mg/mL Injection  Clopixol Acuphase  100 mg / 2 mL Injection | publisher = Lundbeck P/L | year = 1991 | url = http://home.intekom.com/pharm/lundbeck/clopixac.html | accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref>
* As '''zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride''' ('''Clopixol'''), it is a tablet used in the treatment of schizophrenia in those who are compliant with oral medication.<ref name = "Cochzuclo">{{cite web  |vauthors=Kumar A, Strech D | title = Zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride for schizophrenia | work = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | publisher = John Wiley and Sons, Ltd. | year = 2005 | url = http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab005474.html | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005474 | accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref>

It is also used in the treatment of acute [[bipolar mania]].

===Dosing===
As a long acting injection, zuclopenthixol decanoate comes in a 200&nbsp;mg and 500&nbsp;mg ampoule. Doses can vary from 50&nbsp;mg weekly to the maximum licensed dose of 600&nbsp;mg weekly. In general, the lowest effective dose to prevent relapse is preferred. The interval may be shorter as a patient starts on the medication before extending to 3 weekly intervals subsequently. The dose should be reviewed and reduced if side effects occur, though in the short term an anticholinergic medication [[benztropine]] may be helpful for tremor and stiffness, while [[diazepam]] may be helpful for akathisia. 100&nbsp;mg of zuclopenthixol decanoate is roughly equivalent to 20&nbsp;mg of flupentixol decanoate or 12.5&nbsp;mg of [[fluphenazine]] decanoate.

In acutely psychotic and agitated inpatients, 50 – 200&nbsp;mg of zuclopenthixol acetate may be given for a calming effect over the subsequent three days, with a maximum dose of 400&nbsp;mg in total to be given. As it is a long-acting medication, care must be taken not to give an excessive dose.

In oral form zuclopenthixol is available in 10, 25 and 40&nbsp;mg tablets, with a dose range of 20&ndash;60&nbsp;mg daily.

==Side effects==
Chronic administration of zuclopenthixol (30&nbsp;mg/kg/day for two years) in rats resulted in small, but significant, increases in the incidence of thyroid parafollicular carcinomas and, in females, of mammary adenocarcinomas and of pancreatic islet cell adenomas and carcinomas. An increase in the incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas is a common finding for D<sub>2</sub> antagonists which increase prolactin secretion when administered to rats. An increase in the incidence of pancreatic islet cell tumours has been observed for some other D<sub>2</sub> antagonists. The physiological differences between rats and humans with regard to prolactin make the clinical significance of these findings unclear.

Other permanent side effects are similar to many other typical antipsychotics, namely [[extrapyramidal symptoms]] as a result of dopamine blockade in subcortical areas of the brain. This may result in symptoms similar to those seen in [[Parkinson's disease]] and include a restlessness and inability to sit still known as [[akathisia]], a slow tremor and stiffness of the limbs.<ref name = "Cochzuclo"/> Zuclopenthixol is thought to be more sedating than the related [[flupentixol]], though possibly less likely to induce extrapyramidal symptoms than other typical depots.<ref name = "Cochzuclo2"/> As with other dopamine antagonists, zuclopenthixol may sometimes elevate [[prolactin]] levels; this may occasionally result in [[amenorrhoea]] or [[galactorrhoea]] in severe cases. [[Neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] is a rare but potentially fatal side effect. Any unexpected deterioration in mental state with confusion and muscle stiffness should be seen by a physician.

Zuclopenthixol decanoate induces a transient dose-dependent sedation. However, if the patient is switched to maintenance treatment with zuclopenthixol decanoate from oral zuclopenthixol or from i.m. zuclopenthixol acetate the sedation will be no problem. Tolerance to the unspecific sedative effect develops rapidly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hpra.ie/img/uploaded/swedocuments/LicenseSPC_PA0115-005-007_03062015110150.pdf|title=Summary of Product Characteristics|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
[[File:Cisordinol.jpg|thumb|150px|Cisordinol 10 mg tablet]]

Zuclopenthixol antagonises both dopamine D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptors, α<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors and 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptors with a high affinity, but has no affinity for cholinergic muscarine receptors. It weakly antagonises the histamine (H<sub>1</sub>) receptor but has no α<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor blocking activity.

Evidence from ''in vitro'' work and clinical sources (i.e. therapeutic drug monitoring databases) suggests that both [[CYP2D6]] and [[CYP3A4]] play important roles in zuclopenthixol metabolism.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Davies SJ, Westin AA, Castberg I, Lewis G, Lennard MS, Taylor S, Spigset O | title = Characterisation of zuclopenthixol metabolism by in vitro and therapeutic drug monitoring studies.  | journal = [[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]] | volume = 122 | issue = 6 | pages = 445&ndash;453 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2010.01619.x }}</ref>
