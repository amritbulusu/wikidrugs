'''Metribolone''' (developmental code name '''R1881'''), also known as '''methyltrienolone''', is an [[oral administration|orally active]] [[anabolic-androgenic steroid]] (AAS) and a [[17α-alkylated anabolic steroid|17α-alkylated]] [[nandrolone]] (19-nortestosterone) [[chemical derivative|derivative]] which was never marketed for [[medical use]] but has been widely used in [[scientific research]] as a [[hot ligand]] in [[androgen receptor]] (AR) [[ligand binding assay]]s (LBAs) and as a [[photoaffinity labeling|photoaffinity label]] for the AR.<ref name="Elks2014">{{cite book|author=J.

Metribolone is an AAS, or an [[agonist]] of the AR, with both [[anabolic]] and [[androgen]]ic activity.<ref name="Llewellyn2011" /> It is one of the most [[potency (pharmacology)|potent]] AAS to have ever been synthesized, with 120 to 300&nbsp;times the oral anabolic potency and 60 to 70&nbsp;times the androgenic potency of the reference AAS [[methyltestosterone]] in castrated male rats, although the same level of potency was not subsequently seen in later studies in humans.<ref name="Llewellyn2011" /><ref name="Brueggemeier2006">{{cite journal|last1=Brueggemeier|first1=Robert W.|title=Sex Hormones (Male): Analogs and Antagonists|year=2006|doi=10.1002/3527600906.mcb.200500066}}</ref> In addition to the AR, metribolone has high [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for the [[progesterone receptor]] (PR), and binds to the [[glucocorticoid receptor]] (GR) as well.<ref name="SinghGauthier2000">{{cite journal | vauthors = Singh SM, Gauthier S, Labrie F | title = Androgen receptor antagonists (antiandrogens): structure-activity relationships | journal = Current Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 211–47 | date = February 2000 | pmid = 10637363 | doi = 10.2174/0929867003375371 }}</ref><ref name="Ho-KimTremblay1981">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ho-Kim MA, Tremblay RR, Dubé JY | title = Binding of methyltrienolone to glucocorticoid receptors in rat muscle cytosol | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 109 | issue = 5 | pages = 1418–23 | date = November 1981 | pmid = 6975208 | doi = 10.1210/endo-109-5-1418 }}</ref> Metribolone has a high potential for [[hepatotoxicity]], similarly to other 17α-alkylated AAS.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Krüskemper HL, Noell G | title = Liver toxicity of a new anabolic agent: methyltrienolone (17-alpha-methyl-4,9,11-estratriene-17 beta-ol-3-one) | journal = Steroids | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–24 | date = July 1966 | pmid = 5955468 | doi = 10.1016/0039-128x(66)90114-0 }}</ref> However, the hepatotoxic potential of metribolone appears to be exceptionally high, likely in relation to its very high potency and [[metabolic stability]]; in a study of treatment with the drug for advanced breast cancer, severe hepatic dysfunction was observed at very low dosages.<ref name="Brueggemeier2006" />

Metribolone was identified in 2010 as a potent inhibitor of [[3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]] (3β-HSD) [[HSD3B1|1]] and [[HSD3B2|2]] ([[IC50|IC<sub>50</sub>]] = 0.02 and 0.16&nbsp;μM, respectively).<ref name="Zheng2010">{{cite book | author = Zheng F | title = Characterization of Enzymes Involved in the Metabolism of Dihydrotestosterone, the Most Potent Natural Androgen | chapter = Methyltrienolone (R1881) is a Potent Inhibitor of 3B-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase (3B-HSD) Activity | pages = 91–103 | type = thesis | year = 2010 | accessdate = 19 July 2017 | format = PDF | url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.428.3729&rep=rep1&type=pdf}}</ref> On the basis of this finding, it has been said that metribolone should be used very cautiously taking into account 3β-HSD inhibition in scientific research to avoid erroneous interpretation.<ref name="Zheng2010" />

==History==
Metribolone was first described in the literature in 1965.<ref name="Llewellyn2011" /> It was studied clinically in the late 1960s and early 1970s, most notably in the treatment of advanced [[breast cancer]].<ref name="Llewellyn2011" /> The drug was found to be effective and showed weak androgenicity, but also produced severe signs of hepatotoxicity, and was ultimately never marketed.<ref name="Llewellyn2011" /><ref name="Brueggemeier2006" /> By the mid-1970s, metribolone was becoming an accepted standard as a ligand and agonist of the AR in scientific research.<ref name="Llewellyn2011" /> It remains in wide use for this purpose today.<ref name="Llewellyn2011" /> Aside from scientific research, metribolone has also been encountered as an AAS in non-medical contexts, for instance in [[doping in sport]]s and [[bodybuilding]].<ref name="Llewellyn2011" />

==Society and culture==

===Generic name===
''Metribolone'' is the [[generic term|generic name]] of metribolone and its {{abbrlink|INN|International Nonproprietary Name}}.<ref name="Elks2014" /> It is also known by the name ''methyltrienolone'' and its developmental code names ''R1881'', ''R-1881'', ''RU-1881'', ''RU1881'', and ''NSC-92858'', and is very commonly referred to by these other names rather than as ''metribolone'' in the scientific literature.<ref name="Elks2014" />

===Doping in sports===
