'''Alendronic acid''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) or '''alendronate sodium''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]) — sold as '''Fosamax''' by [[Merck & Co.|Merck]] — is a [[bisphosphonate]] [[medication|drug]] used for [[osteoporosis]], [[osteogenesis imperfecta]], and several other bone diseases. It is marketed alone as well as in combination with [[vitamin D]] (2,800 IU and 5,600 IU, under the name '''Fosamax+D'''). Merck's [[United States|U.S.]] patent on alendronate expired in 2008 and the drug is now available as a generic. It is the most widely prescribed bisphosphonate medicine in the United States .

==Pharmaceutical analysis==
As with all potent bisphosphonates, the fraction of the drug that reaches the circulatory system intact (systemic [[bioavailability]]) after oral dosing is low, averaging only 0.6–0.7% in women and in men under fasting conditions. Intake together with meals and beverages other than water further reduces the bioavailability. The absorbed drug rapidly partitions, with approximately 50% binding to the exposed bone surface; the remainder is excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Unlike with most drugs, the strong negative charge on the two phosphonate moieties limits oral bioavailability, and, in turn, the exposure to tissues other than bone is very low. After absorption in the bone, alendronate has an estimated terminal elimination half-life of 10 years.<ref name="pmid8689235">{{cite journal |vauthors=Shinkai I, Ohta Y | title = New drugs--reports of new drugs recently approved by the FDA.

==Pharmacology==
Alendronate inhibits [[osteoclast]]-mediated bone-resorption.  Like all bisphosphonates, it is chemically related to inorganic [[pyrophosphate]], the endogenous regulator of bone turnover.  But while pyrophosphate inhibits both osteoclastic [[bone resorption]] and the mineralization of the bone newly formed by [[osteoblast]]s, alendronate specifically inhibits bone resorption without any effect on mineralization at pharmacologically achievable doses.  Its inhibition of bone-resorption is dose-dependent and approximately 1,000 times stronger than the equimolar effect of the first bisphosphonate drug, [[etidronate]].   Under therapy, normal bone tissue develops, and alendronate is deposited in the bone-matrix in a pharmacologically inactive form. For optimal action, enough calcium and vitamin D are needed in the body in order to promote normal bone development. [[Hypocalcemia]] should, therefore, be corrected before starting therapy.

Etidronate has the same disadvantage as pyrophosphate in inhibiting mineralization, but all of the potent ''[[nitrogen|N]]''-containing bisphosphonates including Alendronate and also [[risedronate]], [[ibandronate]], and [[zoledronate]], do not.

==Clinical data==
Treatment of post-menopausal women and people with osteogenesis imperfecta over  the age of 22 with alendronic acid has demonstrated normalization of the rate of bone turnover, significant increase in BMD (bone mineral density) of the spine, hip, wrist and total body, and significant reductions in the risk of vertebral (spine) fractures, wrist fractures, hip fractures, and all non-vertebral fractures.  In the Fracture Intervention Trial, the women with the highest risk of fracture (by virtue of pre-existing vertebral fractures) were treated with ''Fosamax'' 5&nbsp;mg/day for two years followed by 10&nbsp;mg/day for the third year.  This resulted in approximately 50% reductions in fractures of the spine, hip, and wrist compared with the control group taking placebos.  Both groups also took calcium and vitamin D.<ref name="pmid8950879">{{cite journal |vauthors=Black DM, Cummings SR, Karpf DB, Cauley JA, Thompson DE, Nevitt MC, Bauer DC, Genant HK, Haskell WL, Marcus R, Ott SM, Torner JC, Quandt SA, Reiss TF, Ensrud KE | title = Randomised trial of effect of alendronate on risk of fracture in women with existing vertebral fractures.

==Interactions==
* Milk, diet, and drugs containing high amounts of calcium, magnesium or aluminium (antacids): the absorption of alendronate is decreased. At least half an hour should pass after intake of alendronate before taking the supplement or drug.
* Highly active vitamin D analogues or fluorides: no data is available. Concomitant treatment should be avoided.
* The additional beneficial effect of [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|HRT]] (hormone replacement therapy) with [[estrogens]]/[[progestins]] or [[raloxifene]] in postmenopausal women remains to be elucidated, but no interactions have been seen. The combination is therefore possible.
* Intravenous [[ranitidine]] increases the oral bioavailability of alendronate. No clinical consequences are known.
* The combination of [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAID]]s and alendronate may increase the risk of gastric ulcers. Both these drugs have the potential to irritate the upper gastro-intestinal mucosa.

==Dosage==
* Prophylaxis of osteoporosis in women: 5–10&nbsp;mg daily or 35–70&nbsp;mg weekly.
* Therapy of osteoporosis in women and men : 10&nbsp;mg daily or 70&nbsp;mg weekly.
* Osteoporosis under corticosteroids: 5–10&nbsp;mg daily or 35–70&nbsp;mg weekly in men and premenopausal women or those receiving concomitant HRT. In postmenopausal women not receiving HRT, the recommended dose is 10&nbsp;mg daily or 70&nbsp;mg weekly.
* Paget's disease: 40&nbsp;mg daily for 6 months.

The risk of esophageal irritation places special requirements on how this oral drug is taken.  The patient should take the drug only upon rising for the day with 8 oz. of water, and stand, walk, or sit, and remain fasting for 30–45 minutes afterwards (preferably 1–2 hours), then eat breakfast. No other medications should be taken for this time. Lying down or reclining after taking the drug and prior to eating breakfast may cause gastroesophageal reflux and esophageal irritation.
