[[Image:Sildenafil.svg|thumb|[[Sildenafil]] (Viagra), the prototypical PDE5 inhibitor]]

A '''phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor''' ('''PDE5 inhibitor''') is a [[medication|drug]] used to block the degradative action of [[cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5]] (PDE5) on [[cyclic GMP]] in the [[smooth muscle]] cells lining the blood vessels supplying the [[Corpus cavernosum penis|corpus cavernosum]] of the [[penis]]. These drugs are used in the treatment of [[erectile dysfunction]] and were the first effective oral treatment available for the condition. Because PDE5 is also present in the arterial wall [[smooth muscle]] within the [[lung]]s, PDE5 inhibitors have also been explored for the treatment of [[pulmonary hypertension]], a disease in which blood vessels in the lungs become overloaded with fluid, usually as a result of failure of the left ventricle of the heart.

==Indications==

PDE5 inhibitors such as [[sildenafil]] (Viagra), [[tadalafil]] (Cialis), and [[vardenafil]] (Levitra) are clinically indicated for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.<ref>{{cite book| title=Male Sexual Dysfunction: Pathophysiology and Treatment | author= Fouad R. Kandeel | publisher= CRC Press, 2013|page=453| chapter = Treatment of Erectile Dsyfunction in Men with Heart Disease}}</ref> Sildenafil and tadalafil are also indicated for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension.

Sildenafil, the prototypical PDE5 inhibitor, was originally discovered during the search of a novel treatment for [[Angina pectoris|angina]]. Studies in 2002 explored its potential for increasing [[neurogenesis]] after [[stroke]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000034399.95249.59 |title=Sildenafil (Viagra) Induces Neurogenesis and Promotes Functional Recovery After Stroke in Rats |year=2002 |last1=Zhang |first1=R. |journal=Stroke |volume=33 |issue=11 |pages=2675–80 |pmid=12411660 |last2=Wang |first2=Y |last3=Zhang |first3=L |last4=Zhang |first4=Z |last5=Tsang |first5=W |last6=Lu |first6=M |last7=Zhang |first7=L |last8=Chopp |first8=M}}</ref>

==Contraindications==
PDE5 inhibitors are contraindicated in those taking [[nitrate]] medications, such as isosorbide mononitrate or isosorbide dinitrate. Concurrent use of these medications can lead to life-threatening low blood pressure or heart attack. <ref>http://www.clinicalpharmacology-ip.com/Forms/Reports/intereport.aspx?gpcid=2519,2968&l=0</ref>They are also contraindicated in men for whom sexual intercourse is inadvisable due to cardiovascular risk factors.<ref name=Rossi>Rossi S, editor.

==Adverse effects==
The occurrence of [[adverse drug reaction]]s (ADRs) with PDE5 inhibitors appears to be dose-related. [[Headache]] is a very common ADR, occurring in >10% of patients. Other common ADRs include: dizziness, flushing, [[dyspepsia]], nasal congestion or rhinitis.<ref name=Rossi/>

In 2007, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) announced that a warning about possible [[Deafness|sudden hearing loss]] would be added to drug labels of PDE5 inhibitors.<ref name="FDA PDE5">{{cite web | url= http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2007/ucm109012.htm| title= FDA Announces Revisions to Labels for Cialis, Levitra and Viagra| author= | date= 2007-10-18| publisher= [[Food and Drug Administration]]| accessdate=2011-10-30 }}</ref>

Since 2007 there is evidence that PDE5 inhibitors can cause an anterior optic neuropathy.<ref name="Optic neuropathy">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.2007.06839.x |title=The Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors and Non-Arteritic Anterior Ischaemic Optic Neuropathy: Increased Vigilance is Necessary |year=2007 |last1=Rao |first1=Amrith R. |last2=Thwaini |first2=Ali |last3=Ahmed |first3=Hashim U. |last4=Shergill |first4=Iqbal S. |last5=Minhas |first5=Suks |journal=BJU International |volume=100 |pages=3–4 |pmid=17488310 |issue=1}}</ref>

Other ADRs and their incidence vary with the agent and are listed in their individual pages.

==Drug interactions==
PDE5 inhibitors are primarily metabolized by the [[Cytochrome P450 oxidase|cytochrome P450]] enzyme [[CYP3A4]]. The potential exists for adverse drug interactions with other drugs which inhibit or induce CYP3A4, including [[Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|HIV protease inhibitor]]s, [[ketoconazole]], and [[itraconazole]].<ref name=Rossi/> Combination with [[nitrovasodilator]]s such as [[Medical use of nitroglycerin|nitroglycerin]] and [[PETN]] is contraindicated because potentially life-threatening [[hypotension]] may occur.<ref name="AustriaCodex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2009|edition=2009/2010|isbn=3-85200-196-X|language=German}}</ref>

While these drugs preferentially inhibit PDE5, none of them are truly selective, especially at high doses. Sildenafil also inhibits [[PDE6]] and [[PDE9]], with inhibition of PDE6 in the retina thought to be responsible for the vision changes which can be a side effect of the drug. Similarly tadalafil inhibits both PDE5 and [[PDE11]]. However the selectivity of the existing drugs is high enough that inhibition of additional PDE subtypes is not generally a problem in clinical use, and while newer "super-selective" PDE5 inhibitors have been developed for research purposes, it is unlikely any of these will be marketed given the saturation of the erectile dysfunction market at present.

==Mechanism of action==
Part of the physiological process of erection involves the release of [[nitric oxide]] (NO) in vasculature of the [[Corpus cavernosum penis|corpus cavernosum]] as a result of sexual stimulation. NO activates the enzyme [[guanylate cyclase]] which results in increased levels of [[cyclic guanosine monophosphate]] (cGMP), leading to [[smooth muscle]] relaxation in blood vessels supplying the corpus cavernosum, resulting in increased blood flow and an erection.

PDE5 inhibitors inhibit the degradation of cGMP by PDE5, increasing bloodflow to the penis during sexual stimulation.  This mode of action means that PDE5 inhibitors are ineffective without sexual stimulation.
