==Chemistry==

α-PVP gives no reaction with the [[marquis reagent]]. It gives a grey/black reaction with the [[mecke reagent]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://reagent-base.net/reagents-table/ | title=Reactions table | publisher=Reagent Base | accessdate=3 December 2015}}</ref>

===Detection in body fluids===

α-PVP may be quantified in blood, plasma or urine by [[liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry]] to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma α-PVP concentrations are expected to be in a range of 10–50 μg/L in persons using the drug recreationally, >100 μg/L in intoxicated patients and >300 μg/L in victims of acute overdosage.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.3109/15563650.2013.847187| title = Toxicity and death following recreational use of 2-pyrrolidino valerophenone.| journal = Clinical Toxicology| year = 2013| last1 = Eiden| first1 = C.| last2 = Mathieu| first2 = O.| last3 = Catala| first3 = P.| volume=51| pages=899–903| pmid=24111554}}</ref><ref>{{cite book  | author = Baselt RC  | title = Disposition of toxic drugs and chemicals in man | year = 2014 | publisher = Biomedical Publications | location = Seal Beach, Ca. | isbn = 978-0-9626523-9-4 | page = 1751 }}</ref>

=== Legal status ===
α-PVP is a Schedule I drug in [[New Mexico]], [[Delaware]], [[Florida]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Virginia]]. On January 28, 2014, the U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] listed it, along with nine other synthetic [[Substituted cathinone|cathinones]], on the [[Schedule 1, Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs|Schedule 1]] with a temporary ban, effective February 27, 2014.<ref>{{cite web | title = 2014 Rules, DEA/DOJ Diversion Control | url = http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/rules/2014/fr0128.htm}}</ref> The temporary ban was then extended.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/orangebook/orangebook.pdf |title= Lists of<nowiki>:</nowiki>Scheduling Actions, Controlled Substances, Regulated Chemicals|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=August 2016|website= usdoj.gov|publisher=U .

As of October 2015 α-PVP is a controlled substance in China.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sfda.gov.cn/WS01/CL0056/130753.html | title=关于印发《非药用类麻醉药品和精神药品列管办法》的通知 | publisher=China Food and Drug Administration | date=27 September 2015 | language=Chinese | accessdate=1 October 2015}}</ref>

The President of the Republic of Italy classified [[cathinone]] and all structurally derived analogues (including [[pyrovalerone]] analogues) as Narcotics on January 2012.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.politicheantidroga.it/media/491607/decreto%20ministero%20salute%2029%20dicembre%202011.pdf | title=Decreto 29 dicembre 2011 (12A00013) (G.U.

In Australia Alpha-PVP is a [[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons|Schedule 9]] prohibited substance in Australia under the [[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons|Poisons Standard]] (July 2016).<ref name="Poisons Standard">Poisons Standard July 2016 [https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2015L01534 Comlaw.gov.au]</ref> A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.<ref name="Poisons Standard" /> The drug was explicitly made illegal in [[New South Wales]] after it was illegally marketed with the imprimatur of erroneous legal advice that it was not encompassed by analog provisions of the relevant act.  It is encompassed by those provisions, and therefore has been illegal for many years in New South Wales. The legislative action followed the death of two individuals from using it; one jumping off a balcony, another having a heart attack after a state of delirium.<ref name=OldingSydney>{{cite news | author = Olding, Rachel | title = 'Bath salts' death: lethal drug was a top seller | url = http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/bath-salts-death-glenn-punchs-terrifying-end-20131008-2v5jp.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/f3667988d0e042cfbb9b40838a78ab65/naked-paranoids-begging-police-save-them-thats-flakka|title=Flakka, synthetic drug behind increasingly bizarre crimes|publisher=AP|date=30 Apr 2015}}</ref>

=== Economics ===

α-PVP  is sometimes the active ingredient in recreational drugs sold as "[[bath salts (drug)|bath salts]]".<ref name=OldingSydney/>  It may also be distinguished from "bath salts" and sold under a different name: "flakka", a name used in Florida, or "gravel" in other parts of the U.S. It is reportedly available as cheaply as US$5 per dose,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.inc.com/joseph-steinberg/flakka-the-new-illegal-drug-you-need-to-know-about.html |work=Inc. | title=Flakka: The New Illegal Drug You Need to Know About | date=November 8, 2015 | accessdate=November 11, 2015 |author =Joseph Steinberg |authorlink=Joseph Steinberg}}</ref> whereas wholesale price in Chinese markets is about US$1.65 per gram.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://xiosin.com/research-chemicals/pvp-c-67_50.html | title=a-PVP prices from one of online Chinese market | publisher=Xiosin Chemical | accessdate=21 July 2016}}</ref> A laboratory for one county in Florida reported a steady rise in α-PVP detections in seized drugs from none in January–February 2014 to 84 in September 2014.<ref name=Alvarez>{{cite news |url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/fl-flakka-on-the-rise-20150402-story.html |title=Flakka: Rampant designer drug dubbed '$5 insanity' |work=[[Sun-Sentinel]] |location=Fort Lauderdale, Fla. |author =Tonya Alvarez |date=April 2, 2015}}</ref>
