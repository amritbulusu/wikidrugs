'''Lisuride''' (Dopergin, Proclacam, Revanil) is an [[antiparkinson agent]] of the iso-ergoline class, chemically related to the [[dopaminergic]] [[ergoline]] Parkinson's drugs. Lisuride is described as free base (see table on the right) and as hydrogen maleate salt.

Lisuride is used to lower [[prolactin]] and, in low doses, to prevent [[migraine]] attacks. The use of lisuride as initial anti-Parkinsonian treatment has been advocated, delaying the need for [[levodopa]] until lisuride becomes insufficient for controlling the parkinsonian disability. Preliminary trials suggest the [[dermis|dermal]] application of lisuride may be useful in the treatment of [[Parkinson's disease]].  As lisuride is very poorly absorbed when take orally and has a short half-life, continuous transdermal administration offers significant advantages and could make the compound a far more consistent therapeutic.  Lisuride is not currently available in the US, as the drug was not a commercial success in comparison with other dopamine receptor agonist antiparkinsonian compounds.  It is still used clinically in a number of countries in the EU and is still commercially available in the UK and China.

Bromination of Lisuride gives bromerguride.

== Mode of action ==
Lisuride is a dopamine and a [[partial agonist]] for several serotonin receptors. It is an antagonist at the serotonin [[5-HT2B receptor]].<ref name="pmid16614540">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hofmann C, Penner U, Dorow R, Pertz HH, Jähnichen S, Horowski R, Latté KP, Palla D, Schurad B | title = Lisuride, a dopamine receptor agonist with 5-HT2B receptor antagonist properties: absence of cardiac valvulopathy adverse drug reaction reports supports the concept of a crucial role for 5-HT2B receptor agonism in cardiac valvular fibrosis | journal = Clin Neuropharmacol | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 80–6 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16614540 | doi = 10.1097/00002826-200603000-00005| url = http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?an=00002826-200603000-00005 }}</ref> It has a high affinity for the dopamine D2, D3 and D4 receptors, as well as serotonin 5-HT1A<ref name="pmid12373423">{{cite journal |vauthors=Marona-Lewicka D, Kurrasch-Orbaugh DM, Selken JR, Cumbay MG, Lisnicchia JG, Nichols DE |title=Re-evaluation of lisuride pharmacology: 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptor-mediated behavioral effects overlap its other properties in rats |journal=Psychopharmacology |volume=164 |issue=1 |pages=93–107 |date=October 2002 |pmid=12373423 |doi=10.1007/s00213-002-1141-z |url=}}</ref> and 5-HT2A/C receptors.<ref name="pmid9600588">{{cite journal |vauthors=Egan CT, Herrick-Davis K, Miller K, Glennon RA, Teitler M |title=Agonist activity of LSD and lisuride at cloned 5HT2A and 5HT2C receptors |journal=Psychopharmacology |volume=136 |issue=4 |pages=409–14 |date=April 1998 |pmid=9600588 |doi=10.1007/s002130050585 |url=}}</ref>  While lisuride has a similar receptor binding profile to the more well-known and chemically similar ergoloid N,N-diethyl-lysergamide ([[LSD]]) and inhibits dorsal raphe serotonergic neurons in a similar fashion to LSD, a trait which indicates both drugs in the treatment of Parkinson's disease,<ref name="pmid470543">{{cite journal |vauthors=Rogawski MA, Aghajanian GK |title= Response of central monoaminergic neurons to lisuride: comparison with LSD |journal= Life Sci.|year= 1979| volume= 24 |issue=14| pages= 1289–1297 |pmid= 470543 |doi=10.1016/0024-3205(79)90148-6}}</ref> it lacks the [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] effects of its sister compound.
Newer findings suggest the lack of psychedelic action arises from the phenomenon of [[functional selectivity|biased agonism]]. Stimulation of the 5-HT2A [[GPCR oligomer|protomer]] within the [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT2A]]-[[Glutamate receptor#Metabotropic glutamate receptors|mGlu2]] [[GPCR oligomer|receptor complex]] evokes psychedelic effects, while these effects do not occur during sole stimulation of monomeric 5-HT2A receptors. Accordingly, different [[G-protein]]s are involved.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Moreno JL, Holloway T, Albizu L, Sealfon SC, González-Maeso J |title=Metabotropic glutamate mGlu2 receptor is necessary for the pharmacological and behavioral effects induced by hallucinogenic 5-HT2A receptor agonists |journal=Neurosci.
