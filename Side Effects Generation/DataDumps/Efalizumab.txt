'''Efalizumab''' (trade name Raptiva, [[Genentech]], [[Merck Serono]]) is a formerly available [[medication]] designed to treat autoimmune diseases, originally marketed to treat [[psoriasis]]. As [[Nomenclature of monoclonal antibodies|implied by the suffix ''-zumab'']], it is a [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] [[humanized antibody|humanized]] [[monoclonal antibody]]  administered once weekly by [[subcutaneous injection]]. Efalizumab binds to the [[CD11a]] subunit of [[lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1]] and acts as an [[immunosuppressant]] by inhibiting lymphocyte activation and cell migration out of blood vessels into tissues. Efalizumab was associated with fatal brain infections and was withdrawn from the market in 2009.<ref name=Major/>

Known side effects include bacterial [[sepsis]], viral [[meningitis]], invasive fungal disease and [[progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy]] (PML), a brain infection caused by reactivation of latent [[JC virus]] infection.<ref name="urlEfalizumab FDA Warning">{{cite web|url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/InfectiousDisease/PublicHealth/11358|title=Efalizumab FDA Warning|accessdate=7 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal

Due to the risk of PML, the [[European Medicines Agency]] and the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] recommended suspension from the market in the [[European Union]] and the United States, respectively.<ref name="urlEMEA suspension press release">{{cite web|url=http://www.emea.europa.eu/humandocs/PDFs/EPAR/raptiva/2085709en.pdf |title=EMEA press release regarding suspension |format=PDF |accessdate=20 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091226101218/http://www.emea.europa.eu/humandocs/PDFs/EPAR/raptiva/2085709en.pdf |archivedate=26 December 2009 |df= }}</ref> In April 2009, Genentech Inc. announced a phased voluntary withdrawal of Raptiva from the U.S. market.<ref name=Major/><ref>{{cite press release|title=Genentech Announces Voluntary Withdrawal of Raptiva from the U.S. Market|publisher=Genentech, Inc.|date=8 April 2009|url=http://www.drugs.com/news/genentech-announces-voluntary-raptiva-u-s-market-17125.html|accessdate=9 April 2009}}</ref>
