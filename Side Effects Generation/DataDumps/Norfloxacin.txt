Norfloxacin is associated with a number of rare serious adverse reactions as well as spontaneous [[tendon ruptures]] and irreversible [[peripheral neuropathy]]. Tendon problems may manifest long after therapy had been completed and in severe cases may result in lifelong disabilities.

==History==
The first members of the quinolone antibacterial class were relatively low potency drugs such as [[nalidixic acid]], used mainly in the treatment of urinary tract infections owing to their renal excretion and propensity to be concentrated in urine.<ref name="accessdata.fda.gov">{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2001/19757S10lbl.pdf |title=Chibroxin (Norfloxacin) Ophthalmic solution |author=Merck Sharp |author2=Dohme |last-author-amp=yes |authorlink=Merck & Co. |date=September 2000 |publisher=FDA |location=USA |format=PDF }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mayrer AR, Andriole VT |title=Urinary tract antiseptics |journal=Med.

In spite of the substantial increase in antibacterial activity of norfloxacin relative to early fluoroquinolones, it did not become a widely used antibiotic. Other companies initiated fluoroquinolone discovery programs in the aftermath of the publication of the norfloxacin patent. Bayer Pharmaceuticals discovered that the addition of a single carbon atom to the norfloxacin structure provided another 4 to 10-fold improvement in activity.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Wise R, Andrews JM, Edwards LJ |title=In vitro activity of Bay 09867, a new quinoline derivative, compared with those of other antimicrobial agents |journal=Antimicrob.

Kyorin granted Merck & Company, Inc., an exclusive license (in certain countries, including the United States), to import and distribute Norfloxacin under the brand name Noroxin. The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved Noroxin for distribution in the United States on October 31, 1986.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

==Licensed uses==
The initial approval by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1986 encompassed the following indications:

Though the fluoroquinolones are sometimes used to treat [[typhoid]] and [[paratyphoid fever]], it should be noted here that norfloxacin had more clinical failures than the other fluoroquinolones (417 participants, 5 trials).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Effa EE, Lassi ZS, Critchley JA, et al. |title=Fluoroquinolones for treating typhoid and paratyphoid fever (enteric fever) |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |issue=10 |pages=CD004530 |year=2011 |pmid=21975746 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004530.pub4 |editor1-last=Bhutta |editor1-first=Zulfiqar A|displayauthors=1 }}</ref>

In ophthalmology, Norfloxacin licensed use is limited to the treatment of conjunctival infections caused by susceptible bacteria.<ref name="accessdata.fda.gov"/>

Norfloxacin has been restricted in the [[Republic of Ireland]] due to the risks of ''[[Clostridium difficile colitis|C.&nbsp;difficile]]'' super infections and permanent nerve as well as tendon injuries.

The [[European Medicines Agency]], also in 2008, had recommended restricting the use of oral norfloxacin to treat urinary infections. CHMP had concluded that the marketing authorizations for norfloxacin, when used in the treatment of acute or chronic complicated pyelonephritis, should be withdrawn because the benefits do not outweigh their risks in this indication. CHMP stated that doctors should not prescribe oral norfloxacin for complicated pyelonephritis and should consider switching patients already taking oral norfloxacin for this type of infection to an alternative antibiotic.<ref name=docguide>{{Cite web |url=http://www.docguide.com/news/content.nsf/news/852571020057CCF68525749000687709 |title=EMEA Restricts Use of Oral Norfloxacin Drugs in UTIs |publisher=DGNews |location=UK |date=24 July 2008 }}</ref>

Noroxin was discontinued as of April 2014
See the latest package insert for norfloxacin (Noroxin) for additional details.
<ref name=fda08/>

==Mode of action==
Norfloxacin is a [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]] that is active against both
[[Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative]] bacteria.  It functions by inhibiting [[DNA gyrase]], a type II [[topoisomerase]], and topoisomerase IV,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Drlica K, Zhao X |title=DNA gyrase, topoisomerase IV, and the 4-quinolones |journal=Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=377–92 |date=1 September 1997|pmid=9293187 |pmc=232616 |url=http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9293187 }}</ref> enzymes necessary to separate bacterial DNA, thereby inhibiting cell division. Norfloxacin does not bind to DNA gyrase but does bind to the substrate DNA.<ref>{{cite Mechanism of inhibition of DNA gyrase by analogues of nalidixic acid: the target of the drugs is DNA |author= L L Shen |author2= A G Pernet |last-author-amp= yes |PubMed ID2982149 }}</ref>

==Contraindications==
As noted above, under licensed use, norfloxacin is also now considered to be contraindicated for the treatment of certain sexually transmitted diseases by some experts due to bacterial resistance.<ref name="nycms.org"/>

Norfloxacin is contraindicated in those with a history of tendonitis, tendon rupture and those with a hypersensitivity to fluoroquinolones.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/pre96/019384_S027_NOROXIN.pdf |title=19-384/S027 |publisher=FDA |location=USA |format=PDF |year=1995 }}</ref>

There are three contraindications found within the 2008 package<ref name=fda08/> insert:

*"Noroxin (norfloxacin) is contraindicated in persons with a history of hypersensitivity, tendinitis, or tendon rupture associated with the use of norfloxacin or any member of the quinolone group of antimicrobial agents."
*"Quinolones, including norfloxacin, have been shown in vitro to inhibit CYP1A2. Concomitant use with drugs metabolized by CYP1A2 (e.g., caffeine, clozapine, ropinirole, tacrine, theophylline, tizanidine) may result in increased substrate drug concentrations when given in usual doses. Patients taking any of these drugs concomitantly with norfloxacin should be carefully monitored."
*"Concomitant administration with [[tizanidine]] is contraindicated"

Norfloxacin is also considered to be contraindicated within the pediatric population.

*'''Pregnancy'''
Norfloxacin has been reported to rapidly cross the blood-placenta and blood-milk barrier, and is extensively distributed into the fetal tissues.<ref>http://drugsafetysite.com/norfloxacin/ referencing: T.P. Dowling, personal communication, Merck & Co, Inc., 1987</ref> For this reason norfloxacin and other fluoroquinolones are contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of spontaneous abortions and birth defects. The fluoroquinolones have also been reported as being present in the mother’s milk and are passed on to the nursing child, which may increases the risk of the child suffering an adverse reaction even though the child had never been prescribed or taken any of the drugs found within this class.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Shin HC, Kim JC, Chung MK |title=Fetal and maternal tissue distribution of the new fluoroquinolone DW-116 in pregnant rats |journal=Comp.

Post-marketing surveillance has revealed a variety of relatively rare but serious adverse effects that are associated with all members of the fluoroquinolone antibacterial class. Among these, tendon problems and exacerbation of the symptoms of the neurological disorder [[myasthenia gravis]] are the subject of "black box" warnings in the United States. The most severe form of tendonopathy associated with fluoroquinolone administration is tendon rupture, which in the great majority of cases involves the Achilles tendon.

==Interactions==
The toxicity of drugs that are metabolised by the [[cytochrome P450]] system is enhanced by concomitant use of some quinolones. Quinolones, including norfloxacin, may enhance the effects of oral anticoagulants, including warfarin or its derivatives or similar agents. When these products are administered concomitantly, prothrombin time or other suitable coagulation tests should be closely monitored. Coadministration may dangerously increase coumadin [[warfarin]] activity; INR should be monitored closely.
<ref name=fda06/>
They may also interact with the [[GABA A receptor]] and cause neurological symptoms; this effect is augmented by certain [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brouwers JR |title=Drug interactions with quinolone antibacterials |journal=Drug Saf |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=268–81 |date=July 1992 |pmid=1524699 |doi=10.2165/00002018-199207040-00003 |first1=JR |issn=0114-5916 }}</ref> 
The concomitant administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with a quinolone, including norfloxacin, may increase the risk of CNS stimulation and convulsive seizures. Therefore, norfloxacin should be used with caution in individuals receiving NSAIDS concomitantly.<ref>http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2006/019384s045LTR.pdf</ref>

Elevated serum levels of cyclosporine have been reported with concomitant use of cyclosporine with norfloxacin. Therefore, cyclosporine serum levels should be monitored and appropriate cyclosporine dosage adjustments made when these drugs are used concomitantly.

The concomitant administration of quinolones including norfloxacin with glyburide (a sulfonylurea agent) has, on rare occasions, resulted in severe hypoglycemia. Therefore, monitoring of blood glucose is recommended when these agents are co-administered.

===Significant drug interactions===

Some quinolones exert an inhibitory effect on the cytochrome P-450 system, thereby reducing theophylline clearance and increasing theophylline blood levels. Coadministration of certain fluoroquinolones and other drugs primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 (e.g. theophylline, methylxanthines, tizanidine) results in increased plasma concentrations and could lead to clinically significant side effects of the coadministered drug. Additionally other fluoroquinolones, especially enoxacin, and to a lesser extent ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin, also inhibit the metabolic clearance of theophylline.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Janknegt R |title=Drug interactions with quinolones |journal=J. Antimicrob. Chemother. |volume=26 Suppl D |issue= |pages=7–29 |date=November 1990 |pmid=2286594 |doi= 10.1093/jac/26.suppl_D.7|url= |first1=R |issn=0305-7453}}</ref>

Such drug interactions are associated with the molecular structural modifications of the quinolone ring, specifically interactions involving [[NSAIDS]] and [[theophylline]].  As such, these drug interactions involving the fluoroquinolones appear to be drug specific rather than a class effect.  The fluoroquinolones have also been shown to interfere with the metabolism of caffeine<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Harder S, Fuhr U, Staib AH, Wolff T |title=Ciprofloxacin-caffeine: a drug interaction established using in vivo and in vitro investigations |journal=Am. J. Med. |volume=87 |issue=5A |pages=89S–91S |date=November 1989 |pmid=2589393 |doi= 10.1016/0002-9343(89)90031-4|url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/r?dbs+hsdb:@term+@rn+58-08-2 |issn=0002-9343 |format=Free full text}}</ref> and the absorption of levothyroxine. The interference with the metabolism of caffeine may lead to the reduced clearance of caffeine and a prolongation of its serum half-life, resulting in a caffeine overdose.  This may lead to reduced clearance of caffeine and a prolongation of the plasma's half-life that may lead to accumulation of caffeine in plasma when products containing caffeine are consumed while taking norfloxacin.
<ref name=fda06/>

The use of NSAIDs (Non Steroid Anti Inflammatory Drugs) while undergoing fluoroquinolone therapy is contra-indicated due to the risk of severe CNS adverse reactions, including but not limited to seizure disorders. Fluoroquinolones with an unsubstituted piperazinyl moiety at position 7 have the potential to interact with NSAIDs and/or their metabolites, resulting in antagonism of GABA neurotransmission.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Domagala JM |title=Structure-activity and structure-side-effect relationships for the quinolone antibacterials |journal=J. Antimicrob. Chemother. |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=685–706 |date=April 1994 |pmid=8056688 |doi= 10.1093/jac/33.4.685|url=http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/33/4/685 |first1=JM |issn=0305-7453}}</ref>

The use of norfloxacin concomitantly has also been associated with transient elevations in serum creatinine in patients receiving cyclosporine, on rare occasions, resulted in severe hypoglycemia with sulfonylurea. Renal tubular transport of methotrexate may be inhibited by concomitant administration of norfloxacin, potentially leading to increased plasma levels of methotrexate. This might increase the risk of methotrexate toxic reactions.

Current or past treatment with oral corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of Achilles tendon rupture, especially in elderly patients who are also taking the fluoroquinolones.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=van der Linden PD, Sturkenboom MC, Herings RM, Leufkens HM, Rowlands S, Stricker BH |title=Increased risk of achilles tendon rupture with quinolone antibacterial use, especially in elderly patients taking oral corticosteroids |journal=Arch. Intern. Med. |volume=163 |issue=15 |pages=1801–7 |date=August 2003 |pmid=12912715 |doi=10.1001/archinte.163.15.1801 |url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/163/15/1801 |issn=0003-9926}}</ref>

==Overdose==

Treatment of overdose includes emptying of the stomach via induced vomiting or by [[gastric lavage]]. Careful monitoring and supportive treatment, monitoring of renal and liver function, and maintaining adequate hydration is recommended by the manufacturer. Administration of magnesium, aluminum, or calcium containing antacids can reduce the absorption of norfloxacin.<ref name=fda08/>

==Pharmacokinetics==

“Absorption of norfloxacin is rapid following single doses of 200&nbsp;mg, 400&nbsp;mg and 800&nbsp;mg. At the respective doses, mean peak serum and plasma concentrations of 0.8, 1.5 and 2.4 μg/mL are attained approximately one hour after dosing. The effective half-life of norfloxacin in serum and plasma is 3–4 hours. Steady-state concentrations of norfloxacin will be attained within two days of dosing.  Renal excretion occurs by both glomerular filtration and tubular secretion as evidenced by the high rate of renal clearance (approximately 275 mL/min). Within 24 hours of drug administration, 26 to 32% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine as norfloxacin with an additional 5-8% being recovered in the urine as six active metabolites of lesser antimicrobial potency. Only a small percentage (less than 1%) of the dose is recovered thereafter. Fecal recovery accounts for another 30% of the administered dose.  Two to three hours after a single 400-mg dose, urinary concentrations of 200 μg/mL or more are attained in the urine. In healthy volunteers, mean urinary concentrations of norfloxacin remain above 30 μg/mL for at least 12 hours following a 400-mg dose. The urinary pH may affect the solubility of norfloxacin. Norfloxacin is least soluble at urinary pH of 7.5 with greater solubility occurring at pHs above and below this value. The serum protein binding of norfloxacin is between 10 and 15%.” Quoting from the 2009 package insert for Noroxin.<ref name=fda08/>

Biotransformation is via the liver and kidneys, with a half-life of 3–4 hours.<ref name="DB01059">{{cite web | url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01059 | title=Norfloxacin | date=10 June 2013 | accessdate=5 January 2014}}</ref>
