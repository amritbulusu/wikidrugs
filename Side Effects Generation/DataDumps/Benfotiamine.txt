'''Benfotiamine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|rINN]], or '''''S''-benzoylthiamine ''O''-monophosphate''') is a synthetic ''S''-acyl derivative of [[thiamine]]  (vitamin B1).
 
It is marketed as a [[dietary supplement]] in most of the developed world, and as a [[pharmaceutical drug]] in some countries for treating [[diabetic neuropathy]] under the trade name '''Milgamma''' and others.  [[Combination drug]]s with [[pyridoxine]] or [[cyanocobalamin]] are also marketed in a few countries.

==Uses==
Benfotiamine is primarily marketed as an [[antioxidant]] dietary supplement.

In some countries it is marketed as a drug to treat [[diabetic neuropathy]];<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCarty|first1=Mark F.|last2=Inoguchi|first2=Toyoshi|editor1-last=Pasupuleti|editor1-first=Vijai K.|editor2-last=Anderson|editor2-first=James W.|title=Nutraceuticals, glycemic health and type 2 diabetes|date=2008|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell/IFT Press|location=Ames, Iowa|isbn=9780813804286|page=213|edition=1st |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9FvCD-a32VMC&pg=PA213|chapter=11.

==Adverse effects==
There is little published data on adverse effects; in one study of a [[combination drug]] of benfotiamine, pyridoxine, and cyanocobalamin, around 8% of people taking the drug experienced nausea, dizziness, stomach ache and weight gain.<ref name=EFSA2008/>

==Pharmacology==
Benfotiamine is more bioavailable than thiamine salts, providing higher levels of thiamine in muscle, brain, liver, and kidney.<ref name=EFSA2008/>

Benfotiamine is dephosphorylated to S-benzoylthiamine by [[ecto-alkaline phosphatase]]s present in the intestinal mucosa, and is then hydrolyzed to thiamine by [[thioesterase]]s in the liver.<ref name=Bettendorff/>

Benfotiamine mainly acts on peripheral tissues through an increase in transketolase activity.<ref name=Bettendorff/><ref name=EFSA2008>{{cite journal|last1=Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food|title=Scientific Opinion: Benfotiamine, thiamine monophosphate chloride and thiamine pyrophosphate chloride, as sources of vitamin B1 added for nutritional purposes to food supplements|journal=The EFSA Journal|date=2008|volume=864|pages=1–31|url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/scientific_output/files/main_documents/864.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Yamazaki | first1 = M | year = 1968 | title = Studies on the absorption of ''S''-benzoylthiamine ''O''-monophosphate : (I) Metabolism in tissue homogenates | url = | journal = Vitamins | volume = 38 | issue = 1| pages = 12–20 }}</ref>

==Society and culture==
As of 2017, benfotiamine was marketed as a [[pharmaceutical drug]] in Argentina, Bosnia & Herzegowina, Bulgaria, Colombia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Russian Federation, Taiwan, and Vietnam under the following brand names: Benalgis, Benfogamma, Benforce, Benfotiamina, Biotamin, Biotowa, Milgamma, and Vilotram.<ref name=brands>{{cite web|title=Benfotiamine International brands|url=https://www.drugs.com/international/benfotiamine.html|publisher=Drugs.com|accessdate=14 March 2017}}</ref>

It was also marketed in some jurisdictions as a [[combination drug]] with [[cyanocobalamin]] as Milgamma, in combination with [[pyridoxine]] as Milgamma, in combination with [[metformin]] as Benforce-M, and with [[thiamine]] as Vitafos.<ref name=brands/>
