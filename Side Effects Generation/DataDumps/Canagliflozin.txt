Canagliflozin is an [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] of subtype 2 sodium-glucose transport proteins (SGLT2), which is responsible for at least 90% of [[renal glucose reabsorption]] ([[SGLT1]] being responsible for the remaining 10%). Blocking this transporter causes up to 119 grams of blood glucose per day to be eliminated through the urine.<ref name="prous.com">[http://www.prous.com/molecules/default.asp?ID=165 Prous Science: Molecule of the Month November 2007]</ref> It was developed by [[Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma]] and is marketed under license by [[Janssen Pharmaceutica|Janssen]], a division of [[Johnson & Johnson]].<ref name=JNJ>http://www.investor.jnj.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=710584</ref>

==Medical use==
Canagliflozin is an anti-diabetic drug used to improve glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes. In extensive clinical trials, canagliflozin produced a consistent dose-dependent decrease in [[Glycated hemoglobin|HbA<sub>1c</sub>]] levels of 0.77% to 1.16% when administered either as monotherapy, in combination with [[metformin]], in combination with metformin and a [[sulfonylurea]], in combination with metformin and [[pioglitazone]], or in combination with [[insulin]], from initial HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels of 7.8% to 8.1%. When added to metformin, canagliflozin daily was shown to be non-inferior to both [[sitagliptin]] 100&nbsp;mg daily and [[glimepiride]] in reducing HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels at one year, whilst canagliflozin 300&nbsp;mg successfully demonstrated statistical superiority over both sitagliptin and glimiperide in decreasing HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels. Secondary efficacy endpoints of higher reductions in weight and blood pressure (versus sitagliptin and glimiperide) were also observed in studies. Canagliflozin produces beneficial effects on [[HDL cholesterol]] whilst increasing [[LDL cholesterol]] to produce no change in total cholesterol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2013/204042Orig1s000SumR.pdf|title=Summary Review|publisher=fda.gov|format=PDF|date=March 29, 2013|accessdate=2014-07-09}}</ref><ref name="PI">{{cite web|title=Invokana (canagliflozin) Tablets, for Oral Use.

==Adverse effects==
As with all SGLT-2 inhibitors, canagliflozin is associated with increased incidence of urinary tract infections, fungal infections of the genital area, thirst,<ref name="AustriaCodex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|edition=2013/14, supplement 01/14|language=German}}</ref> elevations in LDL cholesterol, increased urination and episodes of [[hypotension|low blood pressure]]. There are concerns that it may also increase the risk of [[diabetic ketoacidosis]].<ref>{{cite web|author1=FDA|title=SGLT2 inhibitors: Drug Safety Communication - FDA Warns Medicines May Result in a Serious Condition of Too Much Acid in the Blood|url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm446994.htm|accessdate=19 May 2015|date=2015-05-15}}</ref>

Possible cardiovascular problems are an ongoing issue with gliflozin drugs.<ref name=FDA>{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/777503|last=Tucker|first=Miriam|title=FDA Advisory Panel Supports Diabetes Drug Canagliflozin|work=Medscape Family Medicine|date=10 January 2013|accessdate=3 August 2015|quote=Safety discussions by the panel circled back repeatedly to the cardiovascular risk data}}</ref> The pre-specified endpoint for cardiovascular safety in the canagliflozin clinical development program was "Major Cardiovascular Events Plus," defined as the occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarctions, non-fatal strokes, or unstable angina leading to hospitalization. This endpoint occurred in more people in the placebo group (20.5%) than in the canagliflozin treated group (18.9%).

Nonetheless, a United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] advisory committee expressed concern regarding the cardiovascular safety of canagliflozin. A greater number of cardiovascular events was observed during the first 30 days in study subjects who received canagliflozin (0.45%) compared those who received placebo (0.07%), suggesting an early period of increased cardiovascular risk. In addition, there was an increased risk of stroke in subjects who received canagliflozin. However, none of these effects were statistically significant. Additional cardiovascular safety data from another ongoing study are expected in 2015.<ref name=FDA/>

On May 15, 2015, the FDA issued a warning that certain SGLT2 diabetes drugs, including canagliflozin, may lead to ketoacidosis, a condition where the body produces higher levels of ketone bodies. The FDA is continuing to investigate the issue, and cautions that patients should not stop taking canagliflozin without first talking to their doctor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/drugs/drugsafety/ucm446845.htm|title=Drug Safety and Availability - FDA Drug Safety Communication: FDA warns that SGLT2 inhibitors for diabetes may result in a serious condition of too much acid in the blood|last=Research|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-06-07}}</ref>

On September 10, 2015, the FDA issued a drug safety communication for canagliflozin to address risks for bone fracture and decreased bone density. A label warning for fractures was already included in the ''Adverse Reactions'' section; however, the FDA made the addition to the ''Warnings and Precautions'' section to reflect new information from a placebo study. They advised health care professionals should consider fracture risk factors before prescribing canagliflozin, and patients should disclose any bone fracture risk factors to their doctors, but that patients should not stop taking the medication without first talking to their doctor.<ref>{{cite web|title=FDA Drug Safety Communication: FDA revises label of diabetes drug canagliflozin (Invokana, Invokamet) to include updates on bone fracture risk and new information on decreased bone mineral density|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm461449.htm|website=FDA|publisher=U.S. Food & Drug Administration|accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref>

On December 4, 2015, the FDA issued another safety communication for SGLT2 inhibitors, indicating that it would require new warnings to be added to the canagliflozin label about elevated blood acid levels and urinary tract infections.<ref>{{cite web|title=SGLT2 Inhibitors: Drug Safety Communication - Labels to Include Warnings About Too Much Acid in the Blood and Serious Urinary Tract Infections|url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm475553.htm|website=FDA|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=11 March 2016}}</ref>

A June 29, 2016 report on the ongoing cardiovascular outcomes trial for canagliflozin (CANVAS) revealed interim findings of new safety concerns including heightened risk of bone fracture that was found to increase with the duration of treatment.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schroeder|first1=C|title=New Report Warns of Increasing SGLT2 & Invokana Risks|url=https://www.drugnews.net/news/sglt2-growth-increased-invokana-risk-side-effects/|website=DrugNews|publisher=Pro Media One|accessdate=8 August 2016}}</ref>

On May 16, 2017, the FDA concluded that canagliflozin causes an increased risk of leg and foot amputations.<ref name="Fox Business"/> The FDA began requiring a [[boxed warning]] to be added to the canagliflozin drug labels to describe this risk.<ref name="FDA.gov"/>

==Interactions==
The drug may increase the risk of [[dehydration]] in combination with [[diuretic]] drugs.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Yamout|first1=H|last2=Perkovic|first2=V|last3=Davies|first3=M|last4=Woo|first4=V|last5=de Zeeuw|first5=D|last6=Mayer|first6=C|last7=Vijapurkar|first7=U|last8=Kline|first8=I|last9=Usiskin|first9=K|last10=Meininger|first10=G|last11=Bakris|first11=G|title=Efficacy and Safety of Canagliflozin in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Stage 3 Nephropathy|journal=American Journal of Nephrology|date=August 2014|volume=40|issue=1|doi=10.1159/000364909|pmid=25059406|url=http://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/364909#|accessdate=31 March 2017}}</ref>

Because it increases renal excretion of glucose, treatment with canagliflozin prevents renal reabsorption of [[1,5-Anhydroglucitol|1,5-anhydroglucitol]], leading to artifactual decreases in serum 1,5-anhydroglucitol. Therefore, canagliflozin can interfere with the use of serum 1,5-anhydroglucitol (assay trade name, GlycoMark) as a measure of postprandial glucose levels.<ref name=Balis2014>{{cite journal|last1=Balis|first1=Dainius A|last2=Tong|first2=Cindy|last3=Meininger|first3=Gary|title=Effect of canagliflozin, a sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, on measurement of serum 1,5-anhydroglucitol|journal=J Diabetes|date=July 2014|volume=6|issue=4|pages=378–380|doi=10.1111/1753-0407.12116}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Canagliflozin is an [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] of subtype 2 sodium-glucose transport proteins (SGLT2), which is responsible for at least 90% of [[renal glucose reabsorption]] ([[SGLT1]] being responsible for the remaining 10%). Blocking this transporter causes up to 119 grams of blood glucose per day to be eliminated through the urine,<ref name="prous.com"/> corresponding to 476 [[kilocalories]]. Additional water is eliminated by [[osmotic diuresis]], resulting in a lowering of blood pressure.

This mechanism is associated with a low risk of [[hypoglycaemia]] (too low blood glucose) compared to other types of anti-diabetic drugs such as [[sulfonylurea]] derivatives and insulin.<ref name="Klement"/>

==History==
On July 4, 2011, the [[European Medicines Agency]] approved a paediatric investigation plan and granted both a deferral and a waiver for canagliflozin (EMEA-001030-PIP01-10) in accordance with EC Regulation No.1901/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/pips/EMEA-001030-PIP01-10/pip_000744.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d129|format= |title=EMEA-001030-PIP01-10|publisher=EMA European Medicines Agency|accessdate=May 6, 2013}}</ref>

Canagliflozin was approved by the FDA on March 29, 2013, and became the first [[SGLT2]] inhibitor in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Canagliflozin|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/docs/obdetail.cfm?Appl_No=204042&TABLE1=OB_Rx|website=www.fda.gov|publisher=United States Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=23 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/29/johnsonjohnson-diabetes-idUSL3N0CL1FV20130329|title=U.S. FDA approves Johnson & Johnson diabetes drug, canagliflozin|quote=U.S. health regulators have approved a new diabetes drug from Johnson & Johnson, making it the first in its class to be approved in the United States.|date=March 29, 2013|publisher=Reuters}}</ref>
