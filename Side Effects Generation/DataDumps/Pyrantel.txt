== Pregnancy and breastfeeding ==

Pyrantel pamoate is considered a [[Pregnancy category]] C drug for use during pregnancy for humans, but is in category A for canines and felines. Pyrantel is considered safe to use in nursing animals.<ref name="isbn0-8138-0518-X">{{cite book | author = Plumb, D. C. | title = Plumb's veterinary drug handbook | publisher = PharmaVet | location = Stockholm, Wis | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-8138-0518-X }}</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==
Pyrantel pamoate acts as a [[depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent]], thereby causing sudden contraction, followed by paralysis, of the [[Parasitic worm|helminths]]. This has the result of causing the worm to "lose its grip" on the intestinal wall and be passed out of the system by natural process. Since Pyrantel is poorly absorbed by the host's intestine, the host is unaffected by the small dosage of medication used. Spastic (tetanic) paralyzing agents, in particular pyrantel pamoate, may induce complete intestinal obstruction in a heavy worm load.<ref name="Salman1997">{{cite journal | last = Salman | first = A. B. | title = Management of intestinal obstruction caused by ascariasis | journal = Journal of Pediatric Surgery | year = 1997 | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 585â€“587 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-3468(97)90712-0 | pmid = 9126759 }}</ref> This obstruction is usually in the form of a worm impaction and happens when a very small, but heavily parasitized animal is treated and tries to pass a large number of dislodged worms at once. Worms usually pass in normal stool or with diarrhea, straining, and occasional vomiting.

==Names==
There are a number of brands, including "Reese's Pinworm Medicine", "Pin-X", "Pin-Rid","PYRANTRIN" formally called "COMBANTRIN", "Anthel", "Helmintox", "Helmex", "Strongid" and Drontal Cat.
