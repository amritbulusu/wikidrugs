===Acne treatment===
[[Image:Benzoyl peroxide gel.jpg|thumb|right|Tube of a water-based 5% benzoyl peroxide preparation for the treatment of [[Acne vulgaris|acne]].]]

Benzoyl peroxide is effective for reducing the number and severity of [[Acne vulgaris|acne lesions]]. BPO has a [[bactericidal]] effect on ''[[Propionibacterium acnes]]'' bacteria associated with acne and does not induce [[antibiotic resistance]].<ref name="Simonart2012">{{Cite journal|last=Simonart |first=T.|title=Newer approaches to the treatment of acne vulgaris|journal=Am.

Benzoyl peroxide for acne treatment is typically applied to the affected areas in gel, cream, or liquid, in concentrations of 2.5% increasing through 5.0%, and up to 10%.<ref name="Simonart2012"/> No strong evidence supports the idea that higher concentrations of benzoyl peroxide are more effective than lower concentrations.<ref name="Simonart2012"/>

Benzoyl peroxide commonly causes initial dryness and sometimes irritation, although the [[skin]] develops [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]] after a week or so. A small percentage of people are much more [[Hypersensitivity|sensitive]] to it and liable to suffer burning, [[itching]], crusting, and possibly [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/benzoyl-peroxide-topical-route/side-effects/drg-20062425|title=Benzoyl peroxide|publisher=Mayo Clinic|date=January 1, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160718155333/http://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/benzoyl-peroxide-topical-route/side-effects/drg-20062425|archivedate=July 18, 2016|df=}}</ref> It is sensible to apply the lowest concentration and build up as appropriate.

In the U.S., the typical concentration for benzoyl peroxide is 2.5% to 10% for both [[Prescription drug|prescription]] and [[over-the-counter drug]] preparations that are used in treatment for acne. Higher concentrations are used for hair bleach and teeth whitening. Benzoyl peroxide, like most [[peroxide]]s, is a powerful [[bleach|bleaching agent]]. Contact with [[fabric]]s or [[hair]] can cause permanent color dampening almost immediately. Even secondary contact can cause bleaching; for example, contact with a towel that has been used to wash off benzoyl peroxide-containing hygiene products.<ref>{{citation | first1 = R.

=== Other ===
Concentrated benzoyl peroxide is potentially [[Explosive material|explosive]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Cartwright|first=Hugh|title=Chemical Safety Data: Benzoyl peroxide|url=http://cartwright.chem.ox.ac.uk/hsci/chemicals/benzoyl_peroxide.html|publisher=Oxford University|accessdate=13 August 2011|date=17 March 2005|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101012224750/http://cartwright.chem.ox.ac.uk/hsci/chemicals/benzoyl_peroxide.html|archivedate=12 October 2010|df=}}</ref> like other [[organic peroxide]]s, and can cause fires [[Pyrophoricity|without external ignition]]. The hazard is acute for the pure material, so the compound is generally used as a solution or a paste. For example, cosmetics contain only a small percent of benzoyl peroxide and pose no explosion risk.

The [[carcinogenic]] potential of benzoyl peroxide has been investigated. A 1981 study published in the journal ''Science'' found that although benzoyl peroxide is not a carcinogen, it does promote cell growth when applied to an [[Tumor initiation|initiated tumor]]. The study concluded, "caution should be recommended in the use of this and other free radical-generating compounds".<ref>{{cite journal|title= Skin tumor-promoting activity of benzoyl peroxide, a widely used free radical-generating compound|date=2012-05-24 |pmid=6791284 | volume=213 |issue=4511 |journal=Science |pages=1023–5 | last1 = Slaga | first1 = TJ | last2 = Klein-Szanto | first2 = AJ | last3 = Triplett | first3 = LL | last4 = Yotti | first4 = LP | last5 = Trosko | first5 = KE|bibcode=1981Sci...213.1023S |doi=10.1126/science.6791284 }}</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==
Classically, benzoyl peroxide is thought to have a three-fold activity in treating acne. It is sebostatic, comedolytic, and inhibits ''[[P. acnes]]''.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Cotterill|first=J. A.|date=1980-01-01|title=Benzoyl peroxide|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6162349|journal=Acta Dermato-Venereologica.

Hormone changes cause an increase in keratin and sebum production leading blocked drainage. ''P. acnes'' has many lytic enzymes that breakdown the proteins and lipids in the sebum, leading to an inflammatory response. The free-radical reaction of BPO can break down the keratin, therefore unblocking the drainange of sebum (comedolytic). It can cause non-specific peroxidation of ''P. acnes'', making it bacteriocidal, and it was thought to decrease sebum production but there is disagreement within the literature on this.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Worret|first=Wolf-Ingo|last2=Fluhr|first2=Joachim W.|date=2006-04-01|title=[Acne therapy with topical benzoyl peroxide, antibiotics and azelaic acid]|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16638058|journal=Journal der Deutschen Dermatologischen Gesellschaft = Journal of the German Society of Dermatology: JDDG|volume=4|issue=4|pages=293–300|doi=10.1111/j.1610-0387.2006.05931.x|issn=1610-0379|pmid=16638058|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707145504/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16638058|archivedate=2017-07-07|df=}}</ref>

=== Anti-inflammatory ===
Some evidence suggests that BPO has an anti-inflammatory effect as well. Micromolar concentrations of BPO prevents neutrophils from releasing reactive oxygen species (ROS)--part of the inflammatory response in acne.<ref name=":1" />

Benzoyl peroxide is usually prepared by [[chemical reaction|treating]] [[hydrogen peroxide]] with [[benzoyl chloride]].
:2&nbsp;C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>COCl + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + 2&nbsp;NaOH → (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CO)<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + 2&nbsp;NaCl + 2&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub>O
The oxygen–oxygen bond in peroxides is weak. Thus benzoyl peroxide readily undergoes [[homolysis (chemistry)|homolysis]] (symmetrical fission), forming [[radical (chemistry)|free radicals]]:
:(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CO)<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> → 2&nbsp;{{chem|C|6|H|5|CO|2|•}}
The symbol <sup>•</sup> indicates that the products are radicals; i.e., they contain at least one unpaired electron. Such species are highly reactive. The homolysis is usually induced by heating. The [[half-life]] of benzoyl peroxide is one hour at 92&nbsp;°C. At 131&nbsp;°C, the half-life is one minute.<ref>{{cite thesis | first = Hui, III | last = Li | title = Synthesis, Characterization and Properties of Vinyl Ester Matrix Resins | url = http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-42198-113329/unrestricted/ch2.pdf | type = Ph.D. | publisher = University of Vermont | chapter = Chapter 2 | year = 1998 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060920122734/http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-42198-113329/unrestricted/ch2.pdf | archivedate = 2006-09-20 | df =  }}</ref>

Benzoyl peroxide breaks down in contact with skin, producing [[benzoic acid]] and oxygen, neither of which is very toxic.<ref>{{SIDS-ref | title = Benzoyl peroxide | id = BENZOYLPER | date = April 2004}}</ref>
