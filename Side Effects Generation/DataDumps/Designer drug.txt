A '''designer drug''' is a [[structural analog|structural]] or [[Functional analog (chemistry)|functional analog]] of a [[controlled substance]] that has been designed to mimic the pharmacological effects of the original drug, while avoiding classification as illegal and/or detection in standard [[drug test]]s.<ref name="pmid21083227">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wohlfarth A, Weinmann W | title = Bioanalysis of new designer drugs | journal = Bioanalysis | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | pages = 965–79 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21083227 | doi = 10.4155/bio.10.32 }}</ref> Designer drugs include [[psychoactive drug|psychoactive substances]] that have been designated by the [[European Union]] as '''new psychoactive substances''' ('''NPS''')<ref name="urlNew Psychoactive Substances (NPS) | Drug War Facts">{{cite web | url = http://www.drugwarfacts.org/cms/chapter/NPS#sthash.rL4NWCVl.dpbs | title = New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) | publisher = Common Sense for Drug Policy | work = Drug War Facts | quote = The term 'new psychoactive substances' had been legally defined by the European Union as a new narcotic or psychotropic drug, in pure form or in a preparation, that is not scheduled under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 or the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971, but which may pose a public health threat comparable to that posed by substances listed in those conventions (Council of the European Union decision 2005/387/JHA).}}</ref> as well as analogs of [[performance-enhancing drugs]] such as '''designer steroids'''.<ref name="pmid22191595">{{cite journal | vauthors = Teale P, Scarth J, Hudson S | title = Impact of the emergence of designer drugs upon sports doping testing | journal = Bioanalysis | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 71–88 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22191595 | doi = 10.4155/bio.11.291 }}</ref> Some of these were originally synthesized by academic or industrial researchers in an effort to discover more potent derivatives with fewer side effects and were later co-opted for recreational use.

The development of designer drugs may be considered a subfield of [[drug design]]. The exploration of modifications to known active drugs—such as their [[structural analogue]]s, [[stereoisomer]]s, and [[derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]]—yields drugs that may differ significantly in effects from their "parent" drug (e.g., showing increased potency, or decreased [[side effects]]).<ref name="pmid22092008"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Buchanan JF, Brown CR | title = 'Designer drugs'.

Despite being a very broad term, applicable to almost every synthetic drug, it is often used to connote synthetic recreational drugs, sometimes even those which have not been designed at all (e.g. LSD, the psychedelic side effects of which were discovered unintentionally).

In some jurisdictions, drugs that are highly similar in structure to a prohibited drug are illegal to trade regardless of that drug's legal status. In other jurisdictions, their trade is a legal grey area, making them [[grey market]] goods. Some jurisdictions may have analogue laws which ban drugs similar in chemical structure to other prohibited drugs, while some designer drugs may be prohibited irrespective of the legal status of structurally similar drugs; in both cases, their trade may take place on the [[black market]].

==History==
{{Over-coverage|date=May 2010}}

===United States===

====1920s–1930s====
Following the passage of the second [[International Opium Convention]] in 1925, which specifically banned [[morphine]], the [[acetyl|diacetyl]] [[ester]] of morphine, [[heroin]], and a number of alternative esters of morphine quickly started to be manufactured and sold. The most notable of these were [[dibenzoylmorphine]] and [[acetylpropionylmorphine]], which have virtually identical effects to heroin but were not covered by the Opium Convention. This then led the Health Committee of the [[League of Nations]] to pass several resolutions attempting to bring these new drugs under control, ultimately leading in 1930 to the first broad analogues provisions extending legal control to all esters of morphine, oxycodone, and hydromorphone.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1953-01-01_2_page009.html | title = Esters of Morphine | journal = UNODC Bulletin on Narcotics | year = 1953 | issue = 2 | pages = 36–38}}</ref> Another early example of what could loosely be termed designer drug use, was during the [[Prohibition]] era in the 1930s, when [[diethyl ether]] was sold and used as an alternative to illegal [[alcoholic beverage]]s in a number of countries.<ref>{{cite book | last = Brecher | first = Edward M. | title = The Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs | publisher = Consumer Reports Magazine. | year = 1972 | name-list-format = vanc }}</ref>

====1960s–1970s====
During the 1960s and 1970s, a number of new synthetic hallucinogens were introduced, with a notable example being the sale of highly potent tablets of [[2,5-Dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine|DOM]] in [[San Francisco]] in 1967.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Snyder SH, Faillace L, Hollister L | title = 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methyl-amphetamine (STP): a new hallucinogenic drug | journal = Science | volume = 158 | issue = 3801 | pages = 669–70 | year = 1967 | pmid = 4860952 | doi = 10.1126/science.158.3801.669 }}</ref> There was little scope to prosecute people over drug analogues at this time, with new compounds instead being added to the controlled drug schedules one by one as they became a problem, but one significant court case from this period was in 1973, when [[Tim Scully]] and [[Nicholas Sand]] were prosecuted for making the acetyl amide of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], known as [[ALD-52]]. At this time ALD-52 was not a controlled drug, but they were convicted on the grounds that in order to make ALD-52, they would have had to be in possession of LSD, which was illegal. The late 1970s also saw the introduction of various analogues of [[phencyclidine]] (PCP) to the illicit market.

====1980s–early 1990s====
The modern use of the term designer drug was coined in the 1980s to refer to various synthetic [[opioid]] drugs, based mostly on the [[fentanyl]] molecule (such as [[Alphamethylfentanyl|α-methylfentanyl]]).<ref>[http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/future_synthetic/future_synthetic.shtml Donald A. Cooper. Future Synthetic Drugs of Abuse. Drug Enforcement Administration, McLean, Virginia]</ref> The term gained widespread popularity when [[MDMA]] (ecstasy) experienced a popularity boom in the mid-1980s. When the term was coined in the 1980s, a wide range of [[narcotics]] were being sold as heroin on the black market. Many were based on fentanyl or [[meperidine]]. One, [[Desmethylprodine|MPPP]], was found in some cases to contain an impurity called [[MPTP]], which caused brain damage that could result in a syndrome identical to full-blown [[Parkinson's disease]], from only a single dose.<ref>{{cite journal | title = The Case of the Frozen Addicts: How the Solution of an Extraordinary Medical Mystery Spawned a Revolution in the Understanding and Treatment of Parkinson's Disease | year = 1996 | volume = 335 | issue = 26 | pages = 2002–2003 | vauthors = Fahn S | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199612263352618}}</ref> Other problems were highly potent fentanyl analogues, which were sold as [[Fentanyl#Illicit use|China White]], that caused many accidental overdoses.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Henderson GL | title = Designer drugs: past history and future prospects | journal = J. Forensic Sci. | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 569–75 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3286815 }}</ref>

Because the government was powerless to prosecute people for these drugs until after they had been marketed successfully, laws were passed to give the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] power to emergency schedule chemicals for a year, with an optional 6-month extension, while gathering evidence to justify permanent scheduling, as well as the analogue laws mentioned previously. Emergency-scheduling power was used for the first time for [[MDMA]]. In this case, the DEA scheduled MDMA as a Schedule I drug and retained this classification after review, even though their own judge ruled that MDMA should be classified Schedule III on the basis of its demonstrated uses in medicine.<ref>[http://www.thedea.org/drughistory.html TheDEA.org: The History of MDMA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The emergency scheduling power has subsequently been used for a variety of other drugs including [[2C-B]], [[Alphamethyltryptamine|AMT]], and [[Benzylpiperazine|BZP]]. In 2004, a [[piperazine]] drug, [[Trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine|TFMPP]], became the first drug that had been emergency-scheduled to be denied permanent scheduling and revert to legal status.

The late 1980s and early 1990s also saw the re-emergence of [[methamphetamine]] in the United States as a widespread public health issue, leading to increasing controls on precursor chemicals in an attempt to cut down on domestic manufacture of the drug. This led to several alternative stimulant drugs emerging, the most notable ones being [[methcathinone]] and [[4-methylaminorex]], but, despite attracting enough attention from authorities to provoke legal scheduling of these compounds, their distribution was relatively limited in extent and methamphetamine continued to dominate the illicit synthetic stimulant market overall.<ref>Philip Jenkins. ''Synthetic Panics: The Symbolic Politics of Designer Drugs''. NYU Press 1999. {{ISBN|978-0-8147-4244-0}}</ref>

====Late 1990s–2004====
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, there was a huge explosion in designer drugs being sold over the internet.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cole MD, Lea C, Oxley N | title = 4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine (2C-B): a review of the public domain literature | journal = Sci.

The idea was that, by selling the chemicals as for "scientific research" rather than human consumption, the [[Mens rea|intent]] clause of the U.S. [[analogue drug]] laws would be avoided. Nonetheless, the DEA raided multiple suppliers, first JLF Primary Materials, and then multiple vendors (such as [[RAC Research]]) several years later in [[Operation Web Tryp]]. This process was accelerated greatly when vendors began advertising via search engines like [[Google]] by linking their sites to searches on key words such as chemical names and terms like [[psychedelic drugs|psychedelic]] or [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogen]]. Widespread discussion of consumptive use and the sources for the chemicals in public forums also drew the attention of the media and authorities.

In 2004, the US Drug Enforcement Administration raided and shut down several Internet-based research chemical vendors in an operation called ''Web Tryp''. With help from the authorities in India and China, two chemical manufacturers were also closed. Many other internet-based vendors promptly stopped doing business, even though their products were still legal throughout much of the world.

Most substances that were sold as "research chemicals" in this period of time are hallucinogens and bear a chemical resemblance to drugs such as [[psilocybin]] and [[mescaline]]. As with other hallucinogens, these substances are often taken for the purposes of facilitating [[spirituality|spiritual]] [[entheogen|processes]], [[Psychedelic drug|mental reflection]] or [[recreational drug|recreation]]. Some research chemicals on the market were not psychoactive, but can be used as [[wikt:Precursor|precursors]] in the [[chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of other potentially psychoactive substances, for example, [[2C-H]], which could be used to make [[2C-B]] and [[2C-I]] among others. Extensive surveys of structural variations have been conducted by pharmaceutical corporations, universities and independent researchers over the last century, from which some of the presently available research chemicals derive. One particularly notable researcher is Dr. [[Alexander Shulgin]], who presented syntheses and [[pharmacology|pharmacological]] explorations of hundreds of substances in the books ''[[TiHKAL]]'' and ''[[PiHKAL]]'' (co-authored with [[Ann Shulgin]]), and has served as an expert witness for the defense in several court cases against manufacturers of psychoactive drugs.

The majority of chemical suppliers sold research chemicals in bulk form as powder, not as pills, as selling in pill form would invalidate the claims that they were being sold for non-consumptive research. Active dosages vary widely from substance to substance, ranging from micrograms to hundreds of milligrams, but while it is critical for the end user to weigh doses with a precision scale, instead of guessing ("eyeballing"), many users did not do this and this led to many emergency room visits and several deaths, which were a prominent factor leading to the emergency scheduling of several substances and eventually Operation Web Tryp. Some compounds such as [[2C-B]] and [[5-Meo-DiPT]] did eventually increase in popularity to the point that they were sold in pill form to reach a wider market, and acquired popular street names ("Nexus" and "Foxy," respectively). Once a chemical reaches this kind of popularity, it is usually just a matter of time before it is added to the list of scheduled (i.e., illegal) drugs.

The late 1990s and early 2000s also saw the first widespread use of novel [[anabolic steroid]]s by athletes in competition. Steroids had been banned by the [[International Olympic Committee]] since 1976, but due to the large number of different anabolic agents available for human and veterinary use, the ability of laboratories to test for all available drugs had always lagged behind the ability of athletes to find new compounds to use. The introduction of increasingly formalised testing procedures, especially with the creation of the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] in 1999, made it much more difficult for athletes to get away with using these drugs without detection, which then led to the synthesis of novel and potent anabolic steroid drugs such as [[tetrahydrogestrinone]] (THG), which were not detectable by the standard tests.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Malvey TC, Armsey TD | title = Tetrahydrogestrinone: the discovery of a designer steroid | journal = Curr Sports Med Rep | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = 227–30 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16004834 | doi = 10.1097/01.csmr.0000306213.87433.11 }}</ref>

====2005–2016====
While through recent history most designer drugs had been either opioids, hallucinogens, or anabolic steroids, the range of possible compounds is limited only by the scientific and patent literature, and recent years have been characterised by a broadening of the range of compounds sold as designer drugs. These have included a wide variety of designer stimulants such as [[geranamine]], [[mephedrone]], [[MDPV]] and [[desoxypipradrol]], several designer sedatives such as [[methylmethaqualone]] and [[premazepam]], and designer analogues of [[sildenafil]] (Viagra), which have been reported as active compounds in "herbal" aphrodisiac products.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Reepmeyer JC, Woodruff JT, d'Avignon DA | title = Structure elucidation of a novel analogue of sildenafil detected as an adulterant in an herbal dietary supplement | journal = J Pharm Biomed Anal | volume = 43 | issue = 5 | pages = 1615–21 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17207601 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpba.2006.11.037 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Venhuis BJ, Blok-Tip L, de Kaste D | title = Designer drugs in herbal aphrodisiacs | journal = Forensic Sci.

Another novel development is the use of research ligands for [[Cosmeceutical|cosmetic]] rather than strictly recreational purposes, such as [[grey-market]] internet sales of the non-approved alpha-[[melanocyte-stimulating hormone]] [[Sunless tanning|tanning]] drugs known as [[Melanotan (disambiguation)|melanotan]] peptides.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Evans-Brown M, Dawson RT, Chandler M, McVeigh J | title = Use of melanotan I and II in the general population | journal = BMJ | volume = 338 | pages = b566 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19224885 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.b566 }}</ref>

{{quote|"...what is new is the wide range of substances now being explored, the aggressive marketing of products that have been intentionally mislabelled, the growing use of the internet, and the speed at which the market reacts to control measures."|[[European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction|EMCDDA]] director Wolfgang Goetz (November 2009).<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8343989.stm |title=EU struggles to curb hard drugs |work=BBC News |date=5 November 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_93236_EN_EMCDDA_AR2009_EN.pdf|title= 2009 Annual report: the state of the drugs problem in Europe.| publisher = European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) | location = Lisbon |accessdate=November 2009}}</ref>}}

Mephedrone and the [[cathinone]]s marked somewhat of a turning point for designer drugs, turning them from little known, ineffective substances sold in [[head shops]] to powerful substances able to compete with classical drugs on the black market. Mephedrone especially experienced a somewhat meteoric rise in popularity in 2009<ref name=Measham>{{cite journal | last1 = Measham | first1 = F. | first2 = K. | last2 = Moore | first3 = R. | last3 = Newcombe | first4 = Z. | last4 = Smith | name-list-format = vanc | date=12 March 2010|title=Tweaking, bombing, dabbing and stockpiling: the emergence of mephedrone and the perversity of prohibition |journal=Drugs and Alcohol Today|volume=10|issue=1|pages=14–21|doi=10.5042/daat.2010.0123}}{{subscription}}</ref> and the resulting media panic resulted in its prohibition in multiple countries, including, unusually, China. Following this there was a considerable emergence of other cathinones which attempted to mimic the effects of mephedrone, and with a newly attracted customer base, plenty of money to drive innovation.

Subsequently, the market rapidly expanded, with more and more substances being detected every year. In 2009, the EMCDDA's early warning system discovered 24 new drugs. In 2010, it found another 41; in 2011, another 49; and in 2012, there were 73 more.<ref name="mikepower">{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/oct/31/drugs-legal-high | title=Drugs unlimited: how I created my very own legal high | work=The Guardian | date=2014-10-31 | accessdate=7 August 2014 | author=Power, Mike}}</ref> In 2013, a further 81 were identified:<ref name=EMCDDA2013>{{cite web | url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/implementation-reports/2013 | title=EMCDDA–Europol 2013 Annual Report on the information exchange, risk assessment and control of new&nbsp;psychoactive substances (implementation of Council Decision 2005/387/JHA) | publisher=[[EMCDDA]] | date=July 2014 | accessdate=8 August 2014 }}</ref> a total of 268 new drugs in just four years. These have not been limited to cathinones, with 35% being cannabinoids and the rest being composed of stimulants, benzodiazepines, psychedelics, dissociatives and to a lesser extent, every other class of drugs, even ibogoids and [[nootropics]].

==Safety==
The safety of research chemicals is untested and little if any research has been done on the [[toxicology]] or pharmacology of most of these drugs. Few, if any, human or [[animal studies]] have been done. Many research compounds have produced unexpected side-effects and adverse incidents due to the lack of screening for off-target effects prior to marketing; both [[bromo-dragonfly]] and [[mephedrone]] seem to be capable of producing pronounced [[vasoconstriction]] under some circumstances, which has resulted in several deaths,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Andreasen MF, Telving R, Birkler RI, Schumacher B, Johannsen M | title = A fatal poisoning involving Bromo-Dragonfly | journal = Forensic Sci.

[[Substituted phenethylamine]]s such as the [[2C (psychedelics)|2C family]] and [[substituted amphetamine]]s such as the [[DOx|DOx family]] have also caused a limited number of deaths.

==Law==
{{See also|Psychoactive Substances Act 2016}}
{{update|section|date=May 2016}}
Due to the recent development of many designer drugs, laws banning or regulating their use have not been developed yet, and in recent cases novel drugs have appeared directly in response to legislative action, to replace a similar compound that had recently been banned.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lindigkeit R, Boehme A, Eiserloh I, Luebbecke M, Wiggermann M, Ernst L, Beuerle T | title = Spice: a never ending story? | journal = Forensic Sci. Int. | volume = 191 | issue = 1-3 | pages = 58–63 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19589652 | doi = 10.1016/j.forsciint.2009.06.008 }}</ref> Many of the chemicals fall under the various drug analogue legislations in certain countries, but most countries have no general analogue act or equivalent legislation and so novel compounds may fall outside of the law after only minor structural modifications.

In the United States, the [[Controlled Substances Act]] was amended by the [[Controlled Substance Analogue Enforcement of 1986]], which attempted to ban designer drugs pre-emptively by making it illegal to manufacture, sell, or possess chemicals that were substantially similar in chemistry and pharmacology to [[Schedule I (US)#Schedule I drugs|Schedule I]] or [[Schedule I (US)#Schedule II drugs|Schedule II]] drugs.

Other countries have dealt with the issue differently. In some, the new drugs are banned as they become a concern, as in Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Sweden. In Sweden, the police and customs from April 2011 may also seize drugs that are not on the list of drugs covered by the anti-drug laws if the police suspect that the purpose of the holding is related to drug abuse. Following a decision by a prosecutor, the police may destroy the seized drugs.<ref>[http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=83&artikel=4469195 Nu beslagtar svenska tullen lagliga droger, Sveriges Radio, 23 April 2011]</ref>

In Ireland, the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act 2010 bans substances based on their psychoactive effect, and was introduced as a catch-all to address the time lag between new substances appearing and their being banned individually.<ref>[http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/drugnet/online/2010/72/article11 ''Ireland passes new law to control ‘head shops’ and ‘legal highs’'' (European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction)]</ref> Draft legislation before the UK parliament as of July 2015 (the [[Psychoactive Substances Bill 2015-16]]) adopts a similar approach.

Some countries, such as Australia, have enacted generic bans but based on chemical structure rather than psychoactive effect: if a chemical fits a set of rules regarding substitutions and alterations of an already-banned drug, then it too is banned.<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/dmata1985256/sch1.html DRUG MISUSE AND TRAFFICKING ACT 1985 - SCHEDULE 1<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>Commonwealth Criminal Code Act 1995 s 314.1(2)</ref>

===Temporary class drug===
{{main|Temporary class drug}}
A temporary class drug is a relatively new status for [[controlled drug]]s, which has been adopted in some jurisdictions, notably [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]], to attempt to bring newly synthesised designer drugs under legal control. The controlled drug legislation in these jurisdictions requires drug scheduling decisions to follow an evidence-based process, where the harms of the drug are assessed and reviewed so that an appropriate legal status can be assigned. Since many designer drugs sold in recent years have had little or no published research that could help inform such a decision, they have been widely sold as "legal highs", often for months, before sufficient evidence accumulates to justify placing them on the controlled drug schedules.

In the UK to avoid being controlled by the [[Medicines Act 1968|Medicines Act]], designer drugs such as [[mephedrone]] have been described as '''"plant food,"''' despite the compounds having no history of being used for these purposes.<ref name=acmdreport>{{cite web|url=http://drugs.homeoffice.gov.uk/publication-search/acmd/ACMD-cathinones-report.pdf|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100402214933/http%3A//drugs.homeoffice.gov.uk/publication%2Dsearch/acmd/ACMD%2Dcathinones%2Dreport.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2 April 2010|title=Consideration of the cathinones|date=31 March 2010|publisher=Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs|page=25|accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref><ref name=bbc2711>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tees/8370130.stm|title=Police warning over 'bubble' drug |date=20 November 2009 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2009-11-27}}</ref><ref name=reed1301>{{Cite news|last=Reed |first=Jim |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/health/newsid_10000000/newsid_10004300/10004366.stm |title=Clubbers are 'turning to new legal high mephedrone'|publisher=BBC News |date=13 January 2010|accessdate=2010-07-04}}</ref>

In the USA, similar descriptions ('''"[[Bath salts (drug)|bath salts]]"''' is the most common) have been used to describe mephedrone as well as [[methylone]] and [[methylenedioxypyrovalerone]] (MDPV).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blog.al.com/breaking/2011/02/synthetic_form_of_cocaine_and.html|title=Synthetic form of cocaine and methamphetamine being packaged as bath salts|publisher=The Huntsville Times |author=Victoria Cumbow|date=2011-02-06|accessdate=2011-02-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2012/05/29/reports-miami-zombie-attacker-may-have-been-using-bath-salts | title = Reports: Miami 'zombie' attacker may have been using 'bath salts' | publisher = CNN | date = May 29, 2012 }}</ref> Combined with labeling that they are "not for human consumption," these descriptions are an attempt to skirt the [[Federal Analog Act]] which forbids drugs that are “substantially similar” to already classified drugs from being sold for human use.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/17/us/17salts.html|title=An Alarming New Stimulant, Legal in Many States|publisher=New York Times|author=Abby Goodnough and Katie Zezima|date=2011-07-16|accessdate=2012-01-15}}</ref>
