Some research suggests citalopram interacts with cannabinoid protein-couplings in the rat brain, and this is put forward as a potential cause of some of the drug's antidepressant effect.<ref name="pmid18084745">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hesketh SA, Brennan AK, Jessop DS, Finn DP | title = Effects of chronic treatment with citalopram on cannabinoid and opioid receptor-mediated G-protein coupling in discrete rat brain regions | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 198 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–36 |date=May 2008 | pmid = 18084745 | doi = 10.1007/s00213-007-1033-3 }}</ref>

===Administration===
Citalopram is typically taken in one dose, either in the morning or evening. It can be taken with or without food. Its absorption does not increase when taken with food,<ref name="Citalopram_PI_Sheet"/> but doing so can help prevent nausea.  Nausea is often caused when the [[5-HT3 receptor|5HT3 receptors]] actively absorb free serotonin, as this receptor is present within the digestive tract.<ref name="isbn0-443-07145-4">{{cite book | author = Rang HP | title = Pharmacology | publisher = Churchill Livingstone | location = Edinburgh | year = 2003 | pages = | isbn = 0-443-07145-4 | page = 187 }}</ref> The [[5-HT3 receptor|5HT3 receptors]] stimulate vomiting. This side effect, if present, should subside as the body adjusts to the medication.

Citalopram is considered safe and well tolerated in the [[Therapeutic window|therapeutic dose]] range. Distinct from some other agents in its class, it exhibits linear [[pharmacokinetics]] and minimal [[drug interaction]] potential, making it a better choice for the elderly or [[Comorbidity|comorbid]] patients.<ref name="pmid11206593">{{cite journal | author = Keller MB | title = Citalopram therapy for depression: a review of 10 years of European experience and data from U.S. clinical trials | journal = J Clin Psychiatry | volume = 61 | issue = 12 | pages = 896–908 |date=December 2000 | pmid = 11206593 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.v61n1202 }}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
[[Sexual dysfunction]] is often a side effect with SSRIs. Specifically, common side effects include difficulty becoming aroused, lack of interest in sex, and [[anorgasmia]] (trouble achieving orgasm). One study showed, however, when remission of major depressive disorder is achieved, quality of life and sexual satisfaction is reported to be higher in spite of sexual side effects.<ref>Ishak WW, Christensen S, Sayer G, Ha K, Li N, Miller J, Nguyen JM, Cohen RM. Sexual satisfaction and quality of life in major depressive disorder before and after treatment with citalopram in the STAR*D study" ''J Clin Psychiatry'' 2013 Mar;74(3) 256-61. {{DOI|10.4088/JCP.12m07933}}</ref>

Citalopram theoretically causes side effects by increasing the concentration of [[serotonin]] in other parts of the body (e.g., the intestines). Other side effects, such as increased apathy and emotional flattening, may be caused by the decrease in [[dopamine]] release associated with increased serotonin. Citalopram is also a mild [[antihistamine]], which may be responsible for some of its sedating properties.<ref name="Stahl_2011"/>{{rp|104}}

Common side effects of citalopram include [[Somnolence|drowsiness]], [[insomnia]], [[nausea]], weight changes (usually weight gain), increase in appetite, vivid dreaming, frequent urination, decreased sex drive, anorgasmia, dry mouth,<ref name="Citalopram_PI_Sheet"/> increased [[perspiration|sweating]], [[Tremor|trembling]], [[diarrhea]], excessive yawning, severe tinnitus, and [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]]. Less common side effects include [[bruxism]], [[vomiting]], [[cardiac arrhythmia]], [[blood pressure]] changes, dilated pupils, [[anxiety]], [[mood swing]]s, [[headache]], and [[dizziness]]. Rare side effects include [[Seizure|convulsions]], [[hallucinations]], severe [[Allergy|allergic reactions]] and [[photosensitivity]].<ref name="Citalopram_PI_Sheet"/> If sedation occurs, the dose may be taken at bedtime rather than in the morning. Some data suggest citalopram may cause nightmares.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Arora | first1 = G | last2 = Sandhu | first2 = G | last3 = Fleser | first3 = C | date = Spring 2012 | title = Citalopram and nightmares | url = | journal = J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci | volume = 24 | issue = 2| page = E43 | doi = 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11040096 }}</ref>

Withdrawal symptoms can occur when this medicine is suddenly stopped, such as [[paraesthesiae]], sleeping problems (difficulty sleeping and intense dreams), feeling dizzy, agitated or anxious, nausea, vomiting, tremors, confusion, sweating, headache, diarrhea, palpitations, changes in emotions, irritability, and eye or eyesight problems. Treatment with citalopram should be reduced gradually when treatment is finished.

Citalopram and other SSRIs can induce a [[Mixed state (psychiatry)|mixed state]], especially in those with undiagnosed [[bipolar disorder]].<ref name="Stahl_2011"/>{{rp|105}}

=== Abnormal heart rhythm ===

=== Interactions ===
{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}
Citalopram should not be taken with  [[Hypericum perforatum|St John's wort]], [[tryptophan]] or [[5-HTP]] as the resulting drug interaction could lead to [[serotonin syndrome]].<ref name="isbn1-58255-436-6">{{cite book | author = Karch AM | title = Lippincott's Nursing Drug Guide | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | location = Hagerstwon, MD | year = 2006 | pages = | isbn = 1-58255-436-6 }}</ref> With St John's wort, this may be caused by compounds in the plant extract reducing the efficacy of the [[liver|hepatic]] [[cytochrome P450]] enzymes that process citalopram.<ref name="urlInteractions with St Johns wort preparations">{{cite web | url = http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/Profs/PUarticles/sjw.htm | title = Interactions with St John's wort preparations | work = Prescriber Update Articles | publisher = New Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority | year = 2000 }}</ref> It has also been suggested that such compounds, including [[hypericin]], [[hyperforin]] and [[flavonoids]], could have SSRI-mimetic effects on the nervous system, although this is still subject to debate.<ref name="urlSt. Johns wort">{{cite web | url = http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/st-johns-000276.htm | title = St. John's wort | work = Medical Reference | publisher = University of Maryland Medical Center | year = 2011 }}</ref> One study found that ''[[Hypericum]]'' extracts had similar effects in treating moderate depression as citalopram, with fewer side effects.<ref name="pmid16555167">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gastpar M, Singer A, Zeller K | title = Comparative efficacy and safety of a once-daily dosage of hypericum extract STW3-VI and citalopram in patients with moderate depression: a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled study | journal = Pharmacopsychiatry | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 66–75 |date=March 2006 | pmid = 16555167 | doi = 10.1055/s-2006-931544 }}</ref>

Tryptophan and 5-HTP are precursors to serotonin and can cause a rise in serotonin.  When taken with an SSRI, such as citalopram, this can lead to levels of serotonin that can be lethal. This may also be the case when SSRI's are taken with SRA's ([[serotonin releasing agent|Serotonin Releasing Agents]]) such as in the case of [[MDMA]]. It is possible that SSRIs could reduce the effects associated due an [[Serotonin releasing agent|SRA]], since SSRIs stop the reuptake of Serotonin by blocking [[Serotonin transporter|SERT]]. This would allow less Serotonin in and out of the transporters, thus decreasing the likelihood of [[neurotoxic]] effects. However, these concerns are still disputed as the exact pharmacodynamic effects of Citalopram and MDMA have yet to be fully identified.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

SSRIs, including citalopram, can increase the risk of bleeding, especially when coupled with [[aspirin]], [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAIDs]], [[warfarin]], or other [[anticoagulants]].<ref name="Citalopram_PI_Sheet"/> Citalopram is [[Contraindication|contraindicated]] in individuals taking [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAOIs]], owing to a potential for [[serotonin syndrome]].

Taking citalopram with [[Omeprazole]] may cause higher blood levels of citalopram. This is a potentially dangerous interaction, so dosage adjustments may be needed or alternatives may be prescribed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Drug interactions between Celexa and omeprazole|url=http://www.drugs.com/drug-interactions/celexa-with-omeprazole-679-335-1750-0.html|publisher=Drugs.com|accessdate=28 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=citalopram (Rx) - Celexa|url=http://reference.medscape.com/drug/celexa-citalopram-342958|publisher=Medscape|accessdate=28 January 2014}}</ref>

[[SSRI discontinuation syndrome]] has been reported when treatment is stopped. It includes sensory, gastrointestinal symptoms, dizziness, lethargy, and sleep disturbances, as well as psychological symptoms such as anxiety/agitation, irritability, and poor concentration.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Warner | first1 = C.

No abstract available.{{PMID|18480703}}</ref> Tapering off citalopram therapy, as opposed to abrupt discontinuation, is recommended in order to diminish the occurrence and severity of discontinuation symptoms. Some doctors choose to switch a patient to [[Fluoxetine|Prozac]] (Fluoxetine) when discontinuing Citalopram as Fluoxetine has a much longer half-life (i.e. stays in the body longer compared to Citalopram). This may avoid many of the severe withdrawal symptoms associated with Citalopram discontinuation. This can be done either by administering a single 20&nbsp;mg dose of Fluoxetine or by beginning on a low dosage of Fluoxetine and slowly tapering down. Either of these prescriptions may be written in liquid form to allow a very slow and gradual tapering down in dosage. Alternatively, a patient wishing to stop taking Citalopram may visit a [[compounding]] pharmacy where his or her prescription may be re-arranged into progressively smaller dosages.

===Overdosage===
Overdosage may result in vomiting, sedation, disturbances in heart rhythm, dizziness, sweating, nausea, tremor, and rarely amnesia, confusion, coma, or convulsions.<ref name="Stahl_2011"/>{{rp|105}} Overdose deaths have occurred, sometimes involving other drugs, but also with citalopram as the sole agent. Citalopram and N-desmethylcitalopram may be quantified in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma citalopram concentrations are usually in a range of 50-400 μg/l in persons receiving the drug therapeutically, 1000-3000 μg/l in patients who survive acute overdosage and 3–30&nbsp;mg/l in those who do not survive.<ref name="FDA Drug_Safety_Communication_Celexa">{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm269086.htm | title = Abnormal heart rhythms associated with high doses of Celexa (citalopram hydrobromide) | date = 24 August 2011 | work = Safety Communication | publisher = United States Food and Drug Administration }}</ref><ref name="pmid9140316">{{cite journal |vauthors=Personne M, Sjöberg G, Persson H | title = Citalopram overdose--review of cases treated in Swedish hospitals | journal = J.

===Suicidality===
In the United States, citalopram carries a [[boxed warning]] stating it may increase suicidal thinking and behavior in those under age 24.<ref name="Citalopram_PI_Sheet"/>

==Stereochemistry==
Citalopram has one [[stereocenter]], to which a [[Fluorocarbon|4-fluoro]] [[phenyl group]] and an ''N,N''-dimethyl-3-aminopropyl group bind.  As a result of this [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]], the molecule exists in (two) [[enantiomer]]ic forms (mirror images).  They are termed ''S''-(+)-citalopram and ''R''-(–)-citalopram.

|}

Citalopram is sold as a [[racemic]] mixture, consisting of 50% (''R'')-(−)-citalopram and 50% (''S'')-(+)-citalopram.  Only the (''S'')-(+) enantiomer has the desired antidepressant effect.<ref name="pmid15107657">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lepola U, Wade A, Andersen HF | title = Do equivalent doses of escitalopram and citalopram have similar efficacy?

Whereas citalopram is supplied as the [[Hydrobromic acid|hydrobromide]], escitalopram is sold as the [[oxalate]] salt (hydrooxalate).<ref name="Citalopram_PI_Sheet"/> In both cases, the [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] forms of the amine make these otherwise [[lipophilic]] compounds water-soluble.

==Metabolism==
Citalopram is metabolized in the liver mostly by [[CYP2C19]], but also by [[CYP3A4]] and [[CYP2D6]]. Metabolites desmethylcitalopram and didesmethylcitalopram are significantly less energetic and their contribution to the overall action of citalopram is negligible. The half-life of citalopram is about 35 hours. Approximately 80% is cleared by the liver and 20% by the kidneys.<ref name="DrugBank">{{cite web|title=Citalopram|url=https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00215|website=DrugBank|accessdate=12 February 2017|date=17 August 2016}}</ref> The elimination process is slower in the elderly and in patients with hepatic or renal failure. With once-daily dosing, steady plasma concentrations are achieved in about a week. Potent inhibitors of CYP2C19 and 3A4 might decrease citalopram clearance.<ref>Final Labelling Citalopram http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/04/briefing/4006b1_07_celexa-label.pdf</ref> 
Tobacco smoke exposure was found to inhibit the biotransformation of citalopram in animals, suggesting that the elimination rate of citalopram is
decreased after tobacco smoke exposure.  After intragastric administration, the half-life of the [[racemic]] mixture of citalopram was increased by about 287%.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Majcherczyk | first1 = J | last2 = Kulza | first2 = M | last3 = Senczuk-Przybylowska | first3 = M | last4 = Florek | first4 = E | last5 = Jawien | first5 = W | last6 = Piekoszewski | first6 = W | date = Feb 2012 | title = Influence of tobacco smoke on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram and its enantiomers | url = | journal = J Physiol Pharmacol | volume = 63 | issue = 1| pages = 95–100 | pmid = 22460466 }}</ref>

==History==
Citalopram was first synthesized in 1972 by scientists at the pharmaceutical company [[Lundbeck]] and was first marketed in 1989 in Denmark. It was first marketed in the US in 1998.<ref>Benjamin Rawe and Paul May for Molecule of the Month. 2009 [http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/citalopram/citalopramh.htm Citalopram: A new treatment for depression] Page accessed 16 February 2015</ref> The [[patent]] expired in 2003, allowing other companies to legally produce [[generic drug|generic]] versions. Lundbeck has released escitalopram and acquired a new patent for it. In the United States, Forest Labs manufactures and markets the drug.

==European Commission fine==

On 19 June 2013, the [[European Commission]] imposed a fine of €93.8 million on the Danish pharmaceutical company Lundbeck, plus a total of €52.2 million on several generic pharmaceutical-producing companies.  This was in response to Lundbeck entering an agreement with the companies to delay their sales of generic citalopram after Lundbeck's patent on the drug had expired, thus reducing competition in breach of European [[antitrust law]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=Antitrust: Commission fines Lundbeck and other pharma companies for delaying market entry of generic medicines|date=19 June 2013|publisher=European Union|place=Brussels|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-563_en.htm|accessdate=20 June 2013}}</ref>
