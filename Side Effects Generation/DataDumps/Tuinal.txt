'''Tuinal''' is the brand name of a combination [[drug]] composed of two [[barbiturate]] salts ([[secobarbital]] sodium and [[amobarbital]] sodium) in equal proportions.

Tuinal was introduced as a [[sedative]] medication in the late 1940s by [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]]. It was produced in [[capsule (pharmacy)|gelatin capsule]] form for oral administration. Individual capsules contained 50&nbsp;mg, 100&nbsp;mg, or 200&nbsp;mg of barbiturate salts.

Eli Lilly has discontinued the manufacture of Tuinal in the [[United States]] due to the diminishing use of barbiturates in outpatient treatment. Currently [[Ranbaxy Laboratories|Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals]] is the sole producer of this barbiturate formulation. Flynn Pharma of Ireland manufactures Tuinal, [[Seconal]] and sodium amytal. Amytal has been discontinued, though sodium amytal remains.

Tuinal — or Tuinol as it is sometimes colloquially misspelled, and sometimes called Tuminal — saw widespread use as a [[recreational drug]] from the 1960s through the 1980s.  The pill was known colloquially under the street names "tuis", "tumis","blue tips", "Christmas trees", "rainbows", "beans", "nawls" and "jeebs". Like other barbiturate [[depressant]]s, Tuinal promotes physical and psychological [[chemical dependency|dependency]] and carries a high risk of [[overdose]]. Abuse of this particular drug tapered off after it was withdrawn from the market. 

Tuinal is classified as a Schedule II drug under the [[Controlled Substances Act]] in the United States, meaning it requires a prescription from a licensed practitioner.
