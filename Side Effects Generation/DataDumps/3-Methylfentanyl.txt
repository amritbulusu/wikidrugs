While 3-methylfentanyl was initially sold on the black market for only a short time between 1984 and 1985, its high potency made it an attractive target to clandestine drug producers, as racemic 3-MF is 10–15 times more potent than fentanyl, and so correspondingly larger amounts of cut product for street sales can be produced for an equivalent amount of effort as for producing fentanyl itself; one gram of 3-methylfentanyl might be sufficient to produce several thousand dosage units once diluted for sale. 3-MF has thus reappeared several times, at various places around the world.<ref>{{Cite journal

3-Methylfentanyl has similar effects to fentanyl, but is far more potent due to increased binding affinity to its [[Mu opioid receptor|target]] site. Since fentanyl itself is already highly potent, 3-methylfentanyl is extremely dangerous when used recreationally, and has resulted in many deaths among recreational opioid users ingesting the drug. Side effects of [[fentanyl]] analogs are similar to those of fentanyl itself, which include [[itching]], [[nausea]] and potentially serious [[respiratory depression]], which can be life-threatening. Fentanyl analogs have killed hundreds of people throughout Europe and the former Soviet republics since the most recent resurgence in use began in Estonia in the early 2000s, and novel derivatives continue to appear.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.ijdp.org/article/S0955-3959%2815%2900097-3/abstract | title=Fentanyls: Are we missing the signs?

== Use as chemical weapon ==

3-Methylfentanyl was also reported by media as the identity of the anaesthetic "gas" [[Kolokol-1]] delivered as an aerosol<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cbrneportal.com/moscow-theater-crisis-unknown-chemical-agent-revisited/ | title = Moscow Theater Crisis: Unknown Chemical Agent Revisited | date = March 10, 2014 | publisher = Bruker Detection}}</ref> during the [[Moscow theater hostage crisis]] in 2002 in which many hostages died from accidental overdoses of the narcotic. The opiate antidote [[naloxone]] was on-hand to treat the victims of the crisis, but, whether due to their incarceration or lack of food water and sleep, or due to the novel nature of the still-unconfirmed compound used, acute symptoms continued to develop, resulting in many fatalities despite the administration of naloxone.

==Synthesis==
A number of methods for synthesis have been published. The most recent is probably the method posted by the Serbian chemical society (2004).<ref>http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0352-5139/2004/0352-51390407511I.pdf</ref>

There is another method, though, for constructing the ''N''-Benzyl-3-methyl-4-piperidone in a 2-stage [[Michael reaction]], followed by [[Dieckmann cyclization]] as per usual.
