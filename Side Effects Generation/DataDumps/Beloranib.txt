'''Beloranib''' is a former drug candidate for the treatment of [[obesity]].  It was discovered by CKD Pharmaceuticals and its clinical development was led by Zafgen.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.zafgen.com/PDF/zafgen-series-c-070711.pdf | title = News Release: Zafgen Secures $33 Million Series C Financing | publisher = Zafgen, Inc. | date = July 7, 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111210094436/http://www.zafgen.com/PDF/zafgen-series-c-070711.pdf | archivedate = December 10, 2011 | df =  }}</ref>  [[Drug development]] for the product was halted in 2016.<ref name=nasdaq>{{cite news | url = http://www.nasdaq.com/article/zafgen-halts-development-of-beloranib-to-cut-jobs-by-34-cm651992 | publisher = nasdaq.com | title = Zafgen Halts Development of Beloranib, to Cut Jobs by ~34% | date = July 20, 2016}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Beloranib, an [[analog (chemistry)|analog]] of the natural chemical compound [[fumagillin]], is an [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] of the enzyme [[METAP2]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 15523682 | year = 2005 | last1 = Chun | first1 = E | last2 = Han | first2 = CK | last3 = Yoon | first3 = JH | last4 = Sim | first4 = TB | last5 = Kim | first5 = YK | last6 = Lee | first6 = KY | title = Novel inhibitors targeted to methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2) strongly inhibit the growth of cancers in xenografted nude model | volume = 114 | issue = 1 | pages = 124–30 | doi = 10.1002/ijc.20687 | journal = International Journal of Cancer.

In December 2015, Zafgen halted the Phase III clinical trial of beloranib for Prader–Willi syndrome after a second patient death in order to determine whether the deaths were treatment-related.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/12/03/zafgen-study-idUSL3N13R3OQ20151203|title = UPDATE 4-Zafgen halts obesity drug trial after second patient death|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-03|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>  After discussions with the Food and Drug Administration indicated that the obstacles to gaining approval were insurmountable, product development for beloranib was ended.<ref name=nasdaq/>
