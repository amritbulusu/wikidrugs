==History==
{{See also|Discovery and development of Cannabinoid Receptor 1 Antagonists}}
Rimonabant is a selective CB1 [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] blocker and was [[drug discovery|discovered]] and [[drug development|developed]] by [[Sanofi|Sanofi-Aventis]];<ref name=Barth_1999>{{Citation | last = Barth | first = F. | last2 =Rinaldi-Carmona  | first2 = M. | title = The Development of Cannabinoid Antagonists| journal =Current Medicinal Chemistry| volume = 6 | pages = 745–755| year = 1999 | url=http://www.bentham.org/cmc/contabs/vol6-8.html | pmid = 10469889 | issue = 8 }}</ref>

On 21 June 2006, the [[European Commission]] approved the sale of rimonabant in the then-25-member European Union as a prescription drug for use in conjunction with diet and exercise for patients with a [[body mass index|body mass index (BMI)]] greater than 30&nbsp;kg/m², or patients with a BMI greater than 27&nbsp;kg/m² with associated risk factors, such as type 2 [[diabetes]] or [[dyslipidaemia]].<ref name=EMAlabel>{{cite web|title=Acomplia EPAR|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Summary_for_the_public/human/000666/WC500021282.pdf|publisher=EMA|date=January 30, 2009}} From [http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/000666/human_med_000623.jsp EMA index page]</ref> It was first in its class to be approved anywhere in the world.<ref name=IHS/>

Rimonabant was submitted to the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for approval in the United States in 2005; in 2007, the FDA's Endocrine and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee (EMDAC) concluded that Sanofi-Aventis failed to demonstrate the safety of rimonabant and voted against recommending the anti-obesity treatment for approval<ref>{{cite news|last1=Saul|first1=Stephanie|title=F.D.A.

The drug was approved in Brazil in April 2007.<ref name=Moreira2009/>

In October 2008, the [[European Medicines Agency]] recommended the suspension of Acomplia after the [[Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use]] (CHMP) had determined that the risks of Acomplia [[risk-benefit analysis|outweighed its benefits]] due to the risk of serious psychiatric problems, including suicide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/news_and_events/news/2009/11/news_detail_000244.jsp|title=The European Medicines Agency recommends suspension of the marketing authorisation of Acomplia|publisher=European Medicines Agency|date=23 October 2008|accessdate=18 January 2016}}</ref> In November 2008 an advisory committee in Brazil recommended suspension as well, and that month Sanofi-Aventis suspended sale of the drug worldwide.<ref name=Moreira2009/>  The EMA approval was withdrawn in January 2009.<ref name="euwith">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7687311.stm|title=Anti-obesity drug use suspended|date=23 October 2008|work=BBC News|accessdate=4 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Public_statement/2009/11/WC500012189.pdf |title=Public Statement on Acomplia (rimonabant) Withdrawal of the Marketing Authorisation in the European Union|publisher=European Medicines Agency |date=30 January 2009 |accessdate=18 January 2016}}</ref>  In 2009 India prohibited the manufacture and sale of the drug.<ref name=ban>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdsco.nic.in/writereaddata/DBC.pdfl|title=Drugs banned in India|publisher=Central Drugs Standard Control Organization, Dte.GHS, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India|accessdate=2013-09-17}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Data from clinical trials submitted to regulatory authorities showed that rimonabant caused depressive disorders or mood alterations in up to 10% of subjects and suicidal ideation in around 1%, and in Europe it was contraindicated for people with any psychiatric disorder, including depressed or suicidal people.<ref name=EMAlabel/>

Additionally, nausea and upper respiratory tract infections were very common (occurring in more than 10% of people) adverse effects; common adverse effects (occurring in between 1% and 10% of people) included [[gastroenteritis]], anxiety, irritability, insomnia and other sleep disorders, hot flushes, diarrhea, vomiting, dry or itchy skin, tendonitis, muscle cramps and spasms, fatigue, flu-like symptoms, and increased risk of falling.

The FDA's advisory committee raised concerns that based on animal data, it appeared that the [[therapeutic window]] with regard to CNS toxicity, and specifically seizures was almost nonexistent; the therapeutic dose and the dose that caused seizures in animals appeared to be the same.<ref name=Moreira2009/><ref>{{cite web|title=FDA Briefing Document NDA 21-888 Zimulti (rimonabant) Tablets, 20|url=https://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/07/briefing/2007-4306b1-fda-backgrounder.pdf|publisher=FDA|date=June 13, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Davis-Bruno|first1=Karen|title=Nonclinical Overview: CNS Toxicity with Rimonabant|url=www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/07/slides/2007-4306s1-09-FDA-Bruno.ppt|publisher=FDA, Division of Metabolism & Endocrinology Products|date=June 13, 2007}}</ref>

When the EMA reviewed [[postmarketing surveillance]] data, it found that the risk of psychiatric disorders in people taking rimonabant was doubled.<ref name=Moreira2009/>
