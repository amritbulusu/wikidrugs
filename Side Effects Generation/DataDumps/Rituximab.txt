== Medical uses ==

Rituximab destroys both normal and malignant [[B cells]] that have CD20 on their surfaces and is therefore used to treat diseases which are characterized by having too many B cells, overactive B cells, or dysfunctional B cells.

=== Hematological cancers ===

Rituximab is used to treat [[Hematological malignancy|cancers of the white blood system]] such as [[leukemia]]s and [[lymphoma]]s, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and lymphocyte predominant subtype, of Hodgkin's Lymphoma.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Saini KS, ((Azim HA Jr)), Cocorocchio E, Vanazzi A, Saini ML, Raviele PR, Pruneri G, Peccatori FA | title = Rituximab in Hodgkin lymphoma: Is the target always a hit? | journal = Cancer Treat Rev | volume = 37 | pages = 385–90 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21183282 | doi =  10.1016/j.ctrv.2010.11.005 | issue =  5}}</ref>

=== Organ transplants ===

Rituximab is being used off-label in the management of [[kidney transplant]] recipients. This drug may have some utility in transplants involving incompatible blood groups. It is also used as induction therapy in highly sensitized patients going for kidney transplantation. The use of rituximab has not been proven to be efficacious in this setting and like all depleting agents, carries with it the risk of infection.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Two patients with [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] died of [[progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy]] (PML) after being treated with rituximab. PML is caused by activation of [[JC virus]], a common virus in the brain which is usually latent.

Rituximab has been reported as a possible cofactor in a chronic [[Hepatitis E]] infection in a person with lymphoma.

== Mechanisms of action ==
[[File:Rituximab mechanisms of action.jpg|thumbnail|right|Rituximab mechanisms of action; the three major independent mechanisms are (1) antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), (2) complement mediated cytotoxicity (CMC), and (3) apoptosis; subset panel illustrates a schematic view of CD20 structure and rituximab.<ref name="pmid26443686">{{cite journal|last=Seyfizadeh|first=Narges|author2=Seyfizadeh, Nayer |author3=Hasenkamp, J |author4=Huerta-Yepez, S |title=A molecular perspective on rituximab: A monoclonal antibody for B cell non Hodgkin lymphoma and other affections.|journal=Crit Rev Oncol Hematol|volume=97|pages=275–290|pmid=26443686|doi=10.1016/j.critrevonc.2015.09.001 |year=2016}}</ref>]]
[[File:Rituxan in action.jpg|thumbnail|right|Rituximab binding to CD20. The CD20 proteins are sticking out of the cell membrane, and rituximab, the Y-shaped antibody, is binding to the CD20 proteins.]]
The antibody binds to the cell surface protein [[CD20]]. CD20 is widely expressed on B cells, from early pre-B cells to later in [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]], but it is absent on terminally differentiated [[plasma cell]]s. CD20 does not shed, [[Immunomodulation therapy|modulate]] or internalise. Although the function of CD20 is unknown, it may play a role in [[calcium|Ca<sup>2+</sup>]] influx across plasma membranes, maintaining intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and allowing activation of B cells.

Rituximab tends to stick to one side of B cells, where CD20 is, forming a cap and drawing proteins over to that side. The presence of the cap changed the effectiveness of natural killer (NK) cells in destroying these B cells. When an NK cell latched onto the cap, it had an 80% success rate at killing the cell. In contrast, when the B cell lacked this asymmetric protein cluster, it was killed only 40% of the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/scientists-discover-why-a-specific-cancer-drug-is-so-effective |title=Scientists discover why a specific cancer drug is so effective |doi=10.1182/blood-2013-02-482570 |publisher=KurzweilAI |accessdate=2013-04-29}}</ref><ref name="pmid23613524">{{cite journal|last=Rudnicka|first=D|author2=Oszmiana, A |author3=Finch, DK |author4=Strickland, I |author5=Schofield, DJ |author6=Lowe, DC |author7=Sleeman, MA |author8= Davis, DM |title=Rituximab causes a polarization of B cells that augments its therapeutic function in NK-cell-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.|journal=Blood|date=Jun 6, 2013|volume=121|issue=23|pages=4694–702|pmid=23613524|doi=10.1182/blood-2013-02-482570}}</ref>

* The [[Fragment crystallizable region|Fc]] portion of rituximab mediates [[antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity]] (ADCC) and [[complement-dependent cytotoxicity]] (CDC).
* Rituximab has a general regulatory effect on the [[cell cycle]].
* It increases [[MHC II]] and adhesion molecules LFA-1 and LFA-3 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen).
* It elicits shedding of [[CD23]].
* It downregulates the [[B cell receptor]].
* It induces [[apoptosis]] of CD20+ cells.

The combined effect results in the elimination of B cells (including the cancerous ones) from the body, allowing a new population of healthy B cells to develop from lymphoid [[stem cell]]s.

Rituximab binds to [[amino acid]]s 170-173 and 182-185 on CD20, which are physically close to each other as a result of a [[disulfide bond]] between amino acids 167 and 183.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Binder M, Otto F, [[Roland Mertelsmann|Mertelsmann R]], Veelken H, Trepel M. | title = The epitope recognized by rituximab | journal = Blood | volume = 108 | issue = 6| pages =1975–1978  | year = 2006 | pmid = 16705086 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2006-04-014639}}</ref>

Rituximab is currently co-marketed by [[Biogen Idec]] and [[Genentech]] in the U.S., by [[Hoffmann–La Roche]] in Canada and the [[European Union]], [[Chugai Pharmaceuticals]], Zenyaku Kogyo in Japan and [[AryoGen]] in Iran.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

It is on the [[World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines]], a list of the most important medications needed in a basic [[health system]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/EML2015_8-May-15.pdf |title=www.who.int |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

In 2014 Genentech reclassified rituxan as a [[specialty drug]], a class of drugs that are only available through specialty distributors in the US.<ref name="Time_2014"/> Because wholesalers discounts and rebates no longer apply, hospitals would pay more.<ref name="Time_2014">{{cite web | url=http://time.com/3541484/cancer-drug-price-hikes/ | title=Hospitals Furious at Cancer-Drug Price Hikes | work=Time | date=27 October 2014 | accessdate=26 October 2015 | author=Saporito, Bill}}</ref>

Originally available for intravenous injection (e.g. over 2.5 hrs), in 2016 it gained EU approval in a formulation for subcutaneous injection for CLL.<ref>[http://www.biopharma-reporter.com/Bio-Developments/EU-approves-indication-for-subcutaneous-form-of-Roche-s-MabThera/ ]</ref>

==Research==
===Chronic fatigue syndrome===
A potential use for rituximab was identified by two Norwegian doctors who were treating people who had cancer with rituximab; two people also had [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] and the CFS improved.<ref name=castro2017>{{cite journal|last1=Castro-Marrero|first1=J|last2=Sáez-Francàs|first2=N|last3=Santillo|first3=D|last4=Alegre|first4=J|title=Treatment and management of chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis: all roads lead to Rome.|journal=British journal of pharmacology|date=March 2017|volume=174|issue=5|pages=345-369|doi=10.1111/bph.13702|pmid=28052319|pmc=5301046}}</ref>  As of 2017 this use had been explored in some small clinical trials and was undergoing some larger ones; it was unclear as of 2017 whether there is enough benefit in light of the known adverse effects, for rituximab to be a viable treatment for CFS.<ref name=castro2017/>

=== Other anti-CD20 monoclonals ===

The efficacy and success of Rituximab has led to some other anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies being developed:

* [[ocrelizumab]], humanized (90%-95% human) B cell-depleting agent.
* [[ofatumumab]] (HuMax-CD20) a fully human B cell-depleting agent.<ref name="titleGenmab.com / HuMax-CD20 (ofatumumab)">{{cite web |url=http://www.genmab.com/ScienceAndResearch/ProductsinDevelopment/HuMax-CD20.aspx |title=Genmab.com / HuMax-CD20 (ofatumumab) |accessdate=2007-12-03 |work= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070911144653/http://www.genmab.com/ScienceAndResearch/ProductsinDevelopment/HuMax-CD20.aspx <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-11}}</ref>
* Third-generation anti-CD20s such as [[obinutuzumab]] have a glycoengineered Fc fragment (Fc)<ref name="titleFc-structure">{{cite web |url=http://www.healthvalue.net/Fc-structure.html |title=Fc-structure |accessdate=2007-12-03 |work=}}</ref> with enhanced binding to Fc gamma receptors, which increase ADCC ([[antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity]]).<ref name="titleMonoclonal antibodies targeting cancer: 'magic bullets' or just the trigger?">{{cite journal |title=Monoclonal antibodies targeting cancer: 'magic bullets' or just the trigger? |work= |pmc=138676 |year=2001 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pmid=11250751 |last1=Eccles |first1=SA |pages=86–90 |journal=Breast cancer research : BCR |doi=10.1186/bcr276}}</ref> This strategy for enhancing a monoclonal antibody's ability to induce ADCC takes advantage of the fact that the displayed Fc glycan controls the antibody's affinity for Fc receptors.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Maverakis E, Kim K, Shimoda M, Gershwin M, Patel F, Wilken R, Raychaudhuri S, Ruhaak LR, Lebrilla CB | title = Glycans in the immune system and The Altered Glycan Theory of Autoimmunity | journal = J Autoimmun | volume = 57 | issue = 6 | pages = 1–13 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25578468 | pmc = 4340844 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaut.2014.12.002}}</ref>
