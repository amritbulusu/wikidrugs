'''Sulbutiamine''' (brand name: '''Arcalion''') is a synthetic derivative of [[thiamine]] (vitamin B<sub>1</sub>). As a [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]] of two modified thiamine molecules, it is a lipophilic compound that crosses the [[blood–brain barrier]] more readily than thiamine and increases the levels of thiamine and thiamine phosphate esters in the brain.<ref name="Bettendorff_2">{{cite journal |vauthors=Bettendorff L, Weekers L, Wins P, Schoffeniels E | title=Injection of sulbutiamine induces an increase in thiamine triphosphate in rat tissues | journal=Biochem Pharmacol | year=1990 | pages=2557&ndash;60 | volume=40 | issue=11 | pmid=2268373 | doi=10.1016/0006-2952(90)90099-7}}</ref> Sulbutiamine was discovered in Japan in an effort to develop more useful thiamine derivatives since it was hoped that increasing the [[lipophilicity]] of thiamine would result in better [[Pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]] properties.<ref name="Volvert">{{cite journal |vauthors=Volvert ML, Seyen S, Piette M, Evrard B, Gangolf M, Plumier JC, Bettendorff L | title=Benfotiamine, a synthetic S-acyl thiamine derivative, has different mechanisms of action and a different pharmacological profile than lipid-soluble thiamine disulfide derivatives | journal=BMC Pharmaco | year=2008 | volume=8 | pmid=18549472 | pages=10 | doi=10.1186/1471-2210-8-10 | pmc=2435522 }}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Thiamin.svg|left|thumb|200px|Thiamine]]
The history of sulbutiamine is closely tied to the study of thiamine in Japan. A deficiency of thiamine causes a nervous system disorder called [[beriberi]].<ref name="Inouye">Inouye K, Katsura E. "Etiology and pathology of beriberi." In: Shimazono N, Katsura E, editors. ''Beriberi and Thiamine'' Igaku Shoin Ltd (1965) p. 1–28</ref> Until the twentieth century, beriberi was prevalent in Japan and other Asian countries due to the widespread dependence on white rice as a staple food. The relationship between beriberi and diet was first noted by a navy surgeon named [[Takaki Kanehiro]].<ref name="Lonsdale">{{cite journal | author=Lonsdale D | title=A Review of the Biochemistry, Metabolism and Clinical Benefits of Thiamin(e) and Its Derivatives | journal=Evid Based Complement Alternat Med | year=2006 | pages=49&ndash;59 | volume=3 | issue=1 | pmid=16550223 | doi=10.1093/ecam/nek009 | pmc=1375232}}</ref> Additional work resulted in the discovery of thiamine, which was isolated in 1926 and synthesized in 1936. The establishment of a Vitamin B Research Committee in Japan led to additional scientific investigation into the properties of thiamine and its derivatives.<ref name="Lonsdale"/>

The first lipophilic thiamine derivative to be discovered was [[allithiamine]], which was isolated from [[garlic]] (''Allium sativum'') in 1951.<ref name=Lonsdale_2>{{cite journal |author=Lonsdale D |title=Thiamine tetrahydrofurfuryl disulfide: a little known therapeutic agent |journal=Med Sci Monit |volume=10 |issue=9 |pages=199–203 |year=2004 |pmid=15328496}}</ref> Allithiamine is an allyl disulfide derivative. After the discovery of allithiamine, several additional derivatives were synthesized with the hope that they would have better pharmacokinetic properties than thiamine. Thiamine is unable to diffuse across plasma membranes because it has a positively charged [[thiazole]] moiety. Instead, it must be transported across plasma membranes by high affinity carriers, and the rate of transport is low.<ref name="Bettendorff_1">{{cite journal |vauthors=Bettendorff L, Wins P | title=Mechanism of thiamine transport in neuroblastoma cells. Inhibition of a high affinity carrier by sodium channel activators and dependence of thiamine uptake on membrane potential and intracellular ATP | journal=J Biol Chem | year=1994 | pages=14379&ndash;85 | volume=269 | issue=20 | pmid=8182042}}</ref> Sulbutiamine overcomes the poor oral [[bioavailability]] of thiamine because it is highly lipophilic. The synthesis of sulbutiamine was reported by [[Taisho Pharmaceutical Co.]] in 1965.<ref name=Taisho>{{cite journal | title = Thiamine disulfide derivatives. I.

==Therapeutic uses==

Sulbutiamine is indicated for the treatment of [[asthenia]]. Asthenia is a condition of chronic fatigue that is cerebral rather than neuromuscular in origin.<ref name="Layzer">{{cite journal |author=Layzer RB |title=Asthenia and the chronic fatigue syndrome |journal=Muscle Nerve |volume=21 |issue=12 |pages=1609–11 |year=1998 |pmid=9843061 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-4598(199812)21:12<1609::AID-MUS1>3.0.CO;2-K}}</ref>{{update after|2015|11|13}}

==Availability==

Sulbutiamine is available in several forms. Arcalion is supplied in 200&nbsp;mg tablets,<ref name="Serdia">{{cite web | url=http://serdiapharma.com/health/arcalion_summary.asp | title=Serdia Pharmaceuticals Arcalion summary | accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref> and generic sulbutiamine is supplied in tablets, capsules, and powder. The manufacturer of Arcalion recommends no more than 600&nbsp;mg per day.<ref name="Serdia" />

==Adverse effects==

Sulbutiamine has few reported adverse effects at therapeutic dosages. According to the manufacturer of Arcalion, a mild skin allergy may occur, and mild agitation has also been observed in elderly patients.<ref name="Serdia"/>
