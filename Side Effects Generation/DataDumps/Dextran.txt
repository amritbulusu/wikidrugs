'''Dextran''' is a complex branched [[glucan]] ([[polysaccharide]] made of many [[glucose]] molecules) composed of chains of varying lengths (from 3 to 2000 [[Atomic mass unit|kilodaltons]]).

The straight chain consists of α-1,6 [[glycosidic]] linkages between glucose molecules, while branches begin from α-1,3 linkages. This characteristic branching distinguishes a dextran from a [[dextrin]], which is a straight chain glucose polymer tethered by α-1,4 or α-1,6 linkages.   <!-- (For information on the numbering of [[carbon]] [[atom]]s in glucose, see the [[glucose]] article.) -->

<!-- History and culture -->
Dextran was first discovered by [[Louis Pasteur]] as a microbial product in wine,<ref>{{cite journal | last = Pasteur|first= L. | title = On the viscous fermentation and the butyrous fermentation | journal = [[Bulletin de la Société Chimique de France|Bull. Soc. Chim. Paris]] |issn= 	0037-8968|language = French| volume = 11 | pages = 30–31 | year = 1861}}</ref> but mass production was only possible after the development by [[Allene Jeanes]] of a process using [[bacteria]].<ref name="Human"/> Dextran is now synthesized from sucrose by certain lactic acid bacteria, the best-known being ''[[Leuconostoc mesenteroides]]'' and ''[[Streptococcus mutans]]''. [[Dental plaque]] is rich in dextrans.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 422963 | pmid=4594114 | volume=8 | title=Detection and preliminary studies on dextranase-producing microorganisms from human dental plaque | year=1973 | journal=Infect.

Medicinally it is used as an [[Thrombosis|antithrombotic]] (anti[[platelet]]), to reduce blood [[viscosity]], and as a volume expander in [[hypovolaemia]].<ref>{{cite book | title = Medical Surgical Nursing | edition = 8th  | last = Lewis|first=Sharon L. | year = 2010|isbn= 978-0323079150}}</ref> [[Dextran 70]] is on the [[WHO Model List of Essential Medicines]], the most important medications needed in a [[health system]].<ref name=WHO2015E>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/EML2015_8-May-15.pdf |title=19th WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (April 2015) |date=April 2015 |accessdate=May 10, 2015 |publisher=WHO }}</ref>

==Uses==

===Microsurgery ===
These agents are used commonly by microsurgeons to decrease vascular [[thrombosis]]. The antithrombotic effect of dextran is mediated through its binding of [[erythrocytes]], [[platelets]], and vascular [[endothelium]], increasing their [[electronegativity]] and thus reducing [[erythrocyte]] aggregation and [[platelet]] adhesiveness. Dextrans also reduce factor VIII-Ag [[Von Willebrand factor]], thereby decreasing platelet function. Clots formed after administration of dextrans are more easily lysed due to an altered thrombus structure (more evenly distributed platelets with coarser [[fibrin]]{{Citation needed|reason=this fact should be cited somewhere, it is too interesting to leave without reference|date=May 2013}}). By inhibiting α-2 antiplasmin, dextran serves as a [[plasminogen]] activator, so possesses [[thrombolytic]] features.

Outside from these features, larger dextrans, which do not pass out of the vessels, are potent osmotic agents, thus have been used urgently to treat [[hypovolemia]]. The hemodilution caused by volume expansion with dextran use improves blood flow, thus further improving patency of microanastomoses and reducing thrombosis. Still, no difference has been detected in antithrombotic effectiveness in comparison of intra-arterial and intravenous administration of dextran. 
  
Dextrans are available in multiple molecular weights ranging from 3,000 Da to 2,000,000 Da.  The larger dextrans (>60,000 Da) are excreted poorly from the kidney, so remain in the blood for as long as weeks until they are metabolized. Consequently, they have prolonged antithrombotic and [[colloidal]] effects. In this family, dextran-40 (MW: 40,000 Da), has been the most popular member for [[Anticoagulant|anticoagulation]] therapy. Close to 70% of dextran-40 is excreted in urine within the first 24 hours after intravenous infusion, while the remaining 30% are retained for several more days.

===Other medical uses===
* It is used in some [[eye drop]]s as a lubricant.<ref>http://www.medicines.org.uk/EMC/medicine/74/SPC/Tears+Naturale/#CLINICAL_PARTS</ref> and in certain intravenous fluids to solubilize other factors, such as iron (in a solution known as Iron Dextran).
*[[Intravenous therapy|Intravenous solution]]s with dextran function both as [[volume expander]]s and means of [[parenteral nutrition]]. Such a solution provides an osmotically neutral fluid that once in the body is digested by cells into glucose and free water. It is occasionally used to replace lost [[blood]] in emergency situations, when replacement blood is not available,<ref name="Human">{{cite web|title=Allene Rosalind Jeanes|url=http://humantouchofchemistry.com/allene-rosalind-jeanes.htm|publisher=Human Touch of Chemistry|accessdate=13 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514101724/http://humantouchofchemistry.com/allene-rosalind-jeanes.htm|archivedate=14 May 2014|df=}}</ref><ref name=Ogilvie>{{cite book|last1=Ogilvie|first1=Marilyn|last2=Harvey|first2=Joy|title=The biographical dictionary of women in science|date=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-92038-8|page=654}}<!--|accessdate=23 October 2015--></ref> but must be used with caution as it does not provide necessary electrolytes and can cause [[hyponatremia]] or other [[electrolyte]] disturbances.
* It also increases [[blood sugar]] levels.

===Laboratory uses===
* Dextran is used in the [[osmotic stress technique]] for applying [[osmotic pressure]] to biological molecules.
* It is also used in some size-exclusion chromatography matrices; an example is [[Sephadex]].
* Dextran has also been used in bead form to aid in bioreactor applications.
* Dextran has been used in immobilization in biosensors.
* Dextran preferentially binds to early [[endosomes]]; fluorescent-labelled dextran can be used to visualize these endosomes under a fluorescent microscope.
* Dextran can be used as a stabilizing coating to protect metal nanoparticles from oxidation and improve biocompatibility.
* Dextran coupled with a fluorescent molecule such as [[fluorescein isothiocyanate]] can be used to create concentration gradients of diffusible molecules for imaging and allow subsequent characterization of gradient slope. 
* Solutions of fluorescently-labelled dextran can be perfused through engineered vessels to analyze vascular permeability <ref>Wang et al. [http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2016/LC/C5LC01050K#!divAbstract "Engineering anastomosis between living capillary networks and endothelial cell-lined microfluidic channels"], [[Lab on a Chip (journal)]], 2016, 16, 282</ref>
* Dextran is used to make [[microcarriers]] for industrial cell culture

==Side effects==
Although relatively few side effects are associated with dextran use, these side effects can be very serious. These include [[anaphylaxis]],<ref>http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/14139#UNDESIRABLE_EFFECTS</ref> volume overload, [[pulmonary edema]], [[cerebral edema]], or platelet dysfunction.

An uncommon but significant complication of dextran osmotic effect is [[acute renal failure]].<ref>{{Cite journal|pmc=1689992|year=1976|last1=Feest|first1=TG|title=Low molecular weight dextran: A continuing cause of acute renal failure|volume=2|issue=6047|pages=1300|journal=British Medical Journal|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.6047.1300|pmid=1000202}}</ref> The pathogenesis of this renal failure is the subject of many debates with direct toxic effect on tubules and [[glomerulus]] versus intraluminal hyperviscosity being some of the proposed mechanisms.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Patients with history of [[diabetes mellitus]], [[Renal failure|renal insufficiency]], or vascular disorders are most at risk.  Brooks and others recommend the avoidance of dextran therapy in patients with [[Chronic kidney disease|chronic renal insufficiency]]<!-- EXPLAIN and CrCl<40 cc per minute -->.
