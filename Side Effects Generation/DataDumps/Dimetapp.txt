'''Dimetapp''' is a brand of over-the-counter cold and allergy medicines manufactured by [[Pfizer]] (formerly [[Wyeth]]).  At one point, Dimetapp as a household word referred to a single combination preparation marketed to relieve symptoms of the [[common cold]], containing [[brompheniramine]] (an [[antihistamine]]) and [[phenylephrine]] (decongestant replacing the formerly used [[pseudoephedrine]], which itself replaced [[phenylpropanolamine]]). Variants were created, including Dimetapp DM with the addition of [[dextromethorphan]] (an antitussive or cough suppressant). Dimetapp Elixir and Colour Free Elixir are intended to relieve nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy watery eyes and sneezing, whereas Dimetapp DM and Dimetapp DM Colour Free Elixir are intended for colds with dry coughs and also to treat whooping cough. Early Dimetapp liquid products were characterized by a strong grape candy flavor. 

Like many over-the-counter medications, Dimetapp relies on marketing and branding as differentiators of otherwise similar (often identical) branded and unbranded medications to maintain their premium pricing.  Additionally, the actual medications are subject to remarketing in other brands.  As an example, "Children's Dimetapp ND" is a 10 mg orally disintegrating loratadine tablet with a "cool blast" flavour additive. The same product with a "Citrus Burst" flavour additive was also manufactured and distributed by [[Wyeth]] but branded and marketed as "Alavert" (not "children's"). 

Dimetapp was acquired by Pfizer in the 2009 acquisition of Wyeth.
