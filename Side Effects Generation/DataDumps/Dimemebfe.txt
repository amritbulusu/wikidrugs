'''Dimemebfe''' ('''5-MeO-BFE''') is a [[recreational drug]]<ref>{{Cite journal | title = The Characterization of 2-(5-Methoxy-1-benzofuran-3-yl)-N,N-dimethylethanamine (5-MeO-BFE) and Differentiation from its N-Ethyl Analog | author = John F.

It acts as an [[agonist]] for the [[5-HT1A receptor|5-HT<sub>1A</sub>]] and [[5-HT2 receptor|5-HT<sub>2</sub>]] family of [[serotonin]] [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s. It is related in structure to the [[Psychedelic_drug|psychedelic]] [[tryptamine]] derivative [[5-MeO-DMT]], but with the [[indole]] [[bioisostere|nitrogen replaced by oxygen]], making dimemebfe a [[benzofuran]] derivative. It is several times less potent as a serotonin agonist than 5-MeO-DMT and with relatively more activity at 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, but still shows strongest effects at the 5-HT<sub>2</sub> family of receptors.<ref>{{ cite journal | last1 = Tomaszewski | first1 = Z. | last2 = Johnson | first2 = M.
