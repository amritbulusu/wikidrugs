'''LGD-4033''' ('''VK5211''', '''Ligandrol''')<ref name=":1" /> is an investigational [[selective androgen receptor modulator]] (SARM) for treatment of conditions such as [[muscle]] wasting and [[osteoporosis]], discovered by [[Ligand Pharmaceuticals]] and currently under development by [[Viking Therapeutics]].<ref name=ligandpress>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=November 20, 2009 |title=Ligand Presents New Preclinical Data on its Lead SARM Molecule LGD-4033 at the Gerontological Society of America Annual Meeting |url=http://investor.ligand.com/Investors/News-and-Events/Press-Releases/Press-Release-Details/2009/Ligand-Presents-New-Preclinical-Data-on-its-Lead-SARM-Molecule-LGD-4033-at-the-Gerontological-Society-of-America-Annual-Meeti/default.aspx |location=San Diego |publisher=[[Ligand Pharmaceuticals]] |accessdate=November 23, 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.vikingtherapeutics.com/2014/05/22/viking-signs-broad-licensing-deal-with-ligand-pharmaceuticals-for-rights-to-five-novel-therapeutic-programs/ Viking Signs Broad Licensing Deal With Ligand Pharmaceuticals for Rights to Five Novel Therapeutic Programs]</ref>

== Commercial Environment ==
Viking Therapeutics does not currently manufacture any pharmaceutical products, but is developing several products to treat metabolic and endocrine disorders. Thus, the company relies upon investments from stockholders and business partners. The company completed its Initial Public Offering in the 2nd quarter of Fiscal Year 2015, generating $22.3M in net proceeds.<ref name=":0">Lian, Brian, Ph.D. "Q2 2015." Viking Therapeutics InvestorRoom. Viking Therapeutics, Inc., 3 Aug. 2015. Web. 21 Nov. 2016.</ref> Viking Therapeutics assumed the largest expense in 2014 from cited Research and Development costs ($21.2M), which may be related to purchase of required equipment and facilities to develop the drug candidates licensed by Ligand Pharmaceuticals in that year, including VK5211.<ref name=":0" />

=== Financial Risks of Development ===
Viking Therapeutics is yet to bring a drug to market. If one or several of their drug candidates does not pass clinical trials before one is successfully brought to market, then a significant amount of stockholders would likely sell their stocks, seriously reducing revenue and capability to continue development of VK5211. Additionally, as noted in the Form 10-Q submitted on 10 November 2016, Viking currently relies heavily upon licensed technologies by Ligand Pharmaceutics. If Viking Therapeutics were to lose this license, then its operating capability would be severely impacted.<ref>Lian, Brian, Ph.D. “Form 10-Q: Viking Therapeutics, Inc. –VKTX.” www.vikingtherapeutics.com (2016).Web. 21 November 2016.</ref>

=== Other Commercial Aspects ===
Ligand Pharmaceutics has disclosed that its royalty fee incurred upon Viking Therapeutics for production and sale of VK5211 would be 7.25-9.25% of the product revenue.<ref>"Royalty Table :: Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (LGND)." Royalty Table :: Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (LGND). Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 21 Nov. 2016. Web. 21 Nov. 2016.</ref>

Another promising drug candidate, VK2809, is expected to drive a major shift in the market cap of Viking Therapeutics and its share of the market for TRβ agonists, which is currently dominated by Madrigal Pharmaceuticals.<ref>Bautz, David, PhD. "VKTX: Phase 2 Study of VK5211 for Hip Fracture Ongoing; Phase 2 Study of VK2809 for Hypercholersterolemia to Commence in Mid-2016." Yahoo Finance - Business Finance, Stock Market, Quotes, News. Yahoo, Inc., 16 May 2016. Web. 21 Nov. 2016.</ref> This would improve the company portfolio as a whole, and would allow for greater capitalization upon the potential success of VK5211.

== Intellectual Property ==
Ligand Pharmaceuticals has patents filed for the manufacture and therapeutic use of certain compounds occupying several stated chemical structures, which are intended for use as selective androgen receptor modulators. The patent is filed under the following designations: US8519158 B2, US8865918, US9359285, US20070254875, US20140005186, US20150099720, and WO2005090282A1. The patents will expire on March 12, 2025. These patents effectively protect any future capitalization upon VK5211 in the market by Viking and Ligand through their licensing agreement.<ref>Zhi, Lin, Robert I. Higuchi, Cornelis Arjan Van Oeveren, Thomas Lot Stevens Lau, and Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated. Androgen Receptor Modulator Compounds and Methods. Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, assignee.

== Regulatory Information ==
VK5211 is currently an Investigational New Drug.

=== Pre-Clinical ===
Oral administration of the drug to ''cynomolgus'' monkeys at daily doses varying from 0 to 75&nbsp;mg/kg over 13 weeks demonstrated significant body weight gain in both males and females. After 48 days, the 75&nbsp;mg/kg dose testing was halted due to toxicity concerns, but this did not negatively impact development as the dose is significantly higher than those being utilized in the Phase 2 clinical trial.<ref>Bautz, David, PhD. "VKTX: Additional Preclinical Data Shows Robust and Durable Weight Gain for VK5211-Treated Primates." Yahoo. Yahoo, Inc., 8 Dec. 2015. Web. 21 Nov. 2016.</ref>

=== Clinical Trials ===
In a Phase 1 clinical trial of 76 adult male humans in which the dose size was varied, a dose-dependent increase in lean body mass was observed with no significant adverse events over 21 days.<ref name=":1">Basaria, S., L. Collins, E. L. Dillon, K. Orwoll, T. W. Storer, R. Miciek, J. Ulloor, A. Zhang, R. Eder, H. Zientek, G. Gordon, S. Kazmi, M. Sheffield-Moore, and S. Bhasin.

The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 68.1 (2012): 87-95. Web. 21 Nov. 2016.</ref>

The Phase 2 clinical trial, initiated on 3 November 2016, consists of 120 patients recovering from hip fracture surgery. The randomized study participants will receive either a placebo or varying dose sizes of VK5211 over a period of 12 weeks, with improved lean body mass as the primary endpoint. Other endpoints include satisfactory results in terms of quality of life, safety, and pharmacokinetics.<ref>"Viking Therapeutics Initiates Phase 2 Trial of VK5211 in Patients Recovering From Hip Fracture."
