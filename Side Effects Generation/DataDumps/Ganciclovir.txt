'''Ganciclovir''' is an [[antiviral medication]] used to treat [[cytomegalovirus]] (CMV) infections. A prodrug form with improved oral [[bioavailability]] ([[valganciclovir]]) has also been developed.

Ganciclovir was approved for medical use in 1994.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Long|first1=Sarah S.|last2=Pickering|first2=Larry K.|last3=Prober|first3=Charles G.|title=Principles and Practice of Pediatric Infectious Disease|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=1437727026|page=1502|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=nQ7-o8JAH7kC&pg=PA1502|language=en}}</ref>

==Medical use==
Ganciclovir is indicated for:<ref name="AMH2006">Rossi S, editor. [[Australian Medicines Handbook]] 2006. Adelaide: Australian Medicines Handbook; 2006. {{ISBN|0-9757919-2-3}}</ref>
*Sight-threatening [[Cytomegalovirus retinitis|CMV retinitis]] in severely [[immunocompromised]] people
*CMV [[pneumonitis]] in [[bone marrow transplant]] recipients
*Prevention of CMV disease in bone marrow and [[organ transplant|solid organ transplant]] recipients
*Confirmed CMV retinitis in people with AIDS (intravitreal implant)

It is also used for acute CMV colitis in HIV/AIDS and CMV pneumonitis in immunosuppressed patients.

Ganciclovir has also been used with some success in treating ''[[Human herpesvirus 6]]'' infections.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nakano|title=Detection and identification of U69 gene mutations encoded by ganciclovir-resistant human herpesvirus 6 using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography|year=2009}}</ref>

Ganciclovir has also been found to be an effective treatment for [[herpes of the eye|herpes simplex virus epithelial keratitis]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wilhelmus|first1=KR|title=Antiviral treatment and other therapeutic interventions for herpes simplex virus epithelial keratitis.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=9 January 2015|volume=1|pages=CD002898|pmid=25879115}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Ganciclovir is commonly associated with a range of serious [[hematology|haematological]] adverse effects. Common [[adverse drug reaction]]s (≥1% of patients) include: [[granulocytopenia]], [[neutropenia]], [[anaemia]], [[thrombocytopenia]], fever, nausea, vomiting, [[dyspepsia]], diarrhea, abdominal pain, flatulence, anorexia, raised liver enzymes, headache, confusion, hallucination, seizures, pain and [[phlebitis]] at injection site (due to high pH), sweating, rash, itch, increased serum [[creatinine]] and blood [[urea]] concentrations.<ref name="AMH2006" />

===Toxicity===

Ganciclovir is considered a potential human [[carcinogen]], [[teratogen]], and [[mutagen]]. It is also considered likely to cause inhibition of [[spermatogenesis]]. Thus, it is used judiciously and handled as a [[cytotoxic drug]] in the clinical setting.<ref name="AMH2006" /><ref name="Cymevene PI">Roche Products Pty Ltd. Cymevene (Australian Approved Product Information). Dee Why (NSW): Roche; 2005.</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Ganciclovir is a synthetic analogue of 2′-deoxy-[[guanosine]]. It is first [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] to ganciclovir monophosphate by a viral kinase encoded by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) gene UL97 during infection. Subsequently, cellular kinases catalyze the formation of ganciclovir diphosphate and ganciclovir triphosphate, which is present in 10-fold greater concentrations in CMV or herpes simplex virus (HSV)-infected cells than uninfected cells.

Ganciclovir triphosphate is a competitive inhibitor of deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) incorporation into DNA and preferentially inhibits viral DNA polymerases more than cellular DNA polymerases. In addition, ganciclovir triphosphate serves as a poor substrate for chain elongation, thereby disrupting viral DNA synthesis by a second route.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Absorption of the oral form is very limited—about 5% fasting, about 8% with food. It achieves a concentration in the [[central nervous system]] of about 50% of the [[blood plasma|plasma]] level. About 90% of plasma ganciclovir is eliminated unchanged in the [[urine]], with a [[half-life]] of 2–6 hours, depending on [[renal function]] (elimination takes over 24 hours in end-stage renal disease).

===Administration===
Acute infections are treated in two phases: 
*induction phase, 5&nbsp;mg per kilogram intravenously every 12 hours for 14–21 days, the intravenous dose given as a 1-hour infusion
*maintenance phase, 5&nbsp;mg per kg intravenously every day
Stable disease is treated with 1000&nbsp;mg orally three times daily.  Similar dosing is used to prevent disease in high-risk patients, such as those infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or those with organ transplants.

Ganciclovir is also available in slow-release formulations for insertion into the [[vitreous humour]] of the [[human eye|eye]], as treatment for [[cytomegalovirus retinitis|CMV retinitis]] (associated with HIV infection).

A topical ophthalmic gel preparation of ganciclovir was recently approved for the treatment of acute herpes simplex keratitis.
