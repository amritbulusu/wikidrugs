'''Pheneridine''' is a [[4-Phenylpiperidine]] derivative that is related to the [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] drug [[pethidine]] (meperidine).

Pheneridine is not currently used in medicine. Presumably it has similar effects to other opioid derivatives, such as [[analgesia]], [[sedation]], [[nausea]] and [[respiratory depression]], however unlike most opioid derivatives it is not specifically listed as an illegal drug, although it would probably be regarded as a [[Federal Analog Act|controlled substance analogue]] of pethidine on the grounds of its related chemical structure in some jurisdictions such as the United States, Canada and Australia, and would be classified as a "Pethidine Analogue" under the New Zealand Misuse of Drugs Act Class C7.
