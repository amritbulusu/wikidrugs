<!-- Definition and uses -->
'''Sildenafil''', sold as the brand name '''Viagra''' among others, is a [[medication]] used to treat [[erectile dysfunction]] and [[pulmonary hypertension|pulmonary arterial hypertension]].<ref name=AHFS2014>{{cite web|title=Sildenafil Citrate|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/sildenafil-citrate.html|publisher=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=Dec 1, 2014}}</ref> Its effectiveness for treating sexual dysfunction in women has not been demonstrated.<ref name=AHFS2014/>

<!-- Side effects and interactions -->
Common side effects include [[headache]]s and [[heartburn]], as well as flushed skin.<!-- <ref name=AHFS2014/> --> Caution is advised in those who have [[cardiovascular disease]].<!-- <ref name=AHFS2014/> --> Rare but serious side effects include [[priapism|prolonged erections]], which can lead to damage to the [[penis]], and sudden-onset [[hearing loss]].<!-- <ref name=AHFS2014/> --> Sildenafil should not be taken by people who take [[nitrates]] such as [[Medical use of nitroglycerin|nitroglycerin]] (glycerin trinitrate), as this may result in a severe and potentially fatal drop in [[blood pressure]].<ref name=AHFS2014/>

<!-- Mechanism of action -->
Sildenafil acts by inhibiting [[cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5]] (phosphodiesterase 5, PDE<sub>5</sub>), an [[enzyme]] that promotes degradation of [[Cyclic guanosine monophosphate|cGMP]], which regulates blood flow in the [[human penis|penis]].

<!-- History, society and culture -->
[[Pfizer]] [[scientist]]s Andrew Bell, David Brown, and Nicholas Terrett originally discovered sildenafil as a treatment for various cardiovascular disorders.<ref name="google.com">{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/patents/US5250534?dq=5,250,534&hl=en&sa=X&ei=hNNvU_eTFdTdoATokYL4DA&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA |title=Patent US5250534 - Pyrazolopyrimidinone antianginal agents - Google Patents |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name="Boolell">{{cite journal | last1 = Boolell | first1 = M | last2 = Allen | first2 = MJ | last3 = Ballard | first3 = SA | last4 = Gepi-Attee | first4 = S | last5 = Muirhead | first5 = GJ | last6 = Naylor | first6 = AM | last7 = Osterloh | first7 = IH | last8 = Gingell | first8 = C | title = Sildenafil: an Orally Active Type 5 Cyclic GMP-Specific Phosphodiesterase Inhibitor for the Treatment of Penile Erectile Dysfunction | journal = International Journal of Impotence Research | date = June 1996 | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 47–52 | pmid = 8858389 }}</ref> Since becoming available in 1998, sildenafil has been a common treatment for erectile dysfunction; its primary competitors are [[tadalafil]] (trade name Cialis) and [[vardenafil]] (Levitra).

==Medical uses==
[[Image:Viagra in Pack.jpg|thumb|261px|Four 100 mg diamond-shaped tablets of branded Viagra]]

===Sexual dysfunction===
The primary indication of sildenafil is treatment of erectile dysfunction (inability to sustain a satisfactory erection to complete intercourse). Its use is now one of the standard treatments for erectile dysfunction, including for men with [[diabetes mellitus]].<ref name="Vardi">{{cite journal | last1 = Vardi | first1 = M | last2 = Nini | first2 = A | title = Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors for Erectile Dysfunction in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | date = 24 January 2007 | issue = 1 | page = CD002187 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD002187.pub3 | pmid = 17253475 }}</ref>

====Antidepressant-associated sexual dysfunction====
Tentative evidence suggests that sildenafil may help men who experience [[antidepressant]]-induced [[erectile dysfunction]].<ref name="Taylor">{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = MJ | last2 = Rudkin | first2 = L | last3 = Bullemor-Day | first3 = P | last4 = Lubin | first4 = J | last5 = Chukwujekwu | first5 = C | last6 = Hawton | first6 = K | title = Strategies for Managing Sexual Dysfunction Induced by Antidepressant Medication | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | date = 31 May 2013 | issue = 5 | page = CD003382 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003382.pub3 | pmid = 23728643 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003382.pub3/epdf | accessdate = 5 November 2016}}</ref>

===Pulmonary hypertension===
While sildenafil improves some markers of disease in people with [[Pulmonary hypertension|pulmonary arterial hypertension]], it does not appear to affect the risk of death or serious side effects as of 2014.<ref name="Wang">{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = RC | last2 = Jiang | first2 = FM | last3 = Zheng | first3 = QL | last4 = Li | first4 = CT | last5 = Peng | first5 = XY | last6 = He | first6 = CY | last7 = Luo | first7 = J | last8 = Liang | first8 = ZA | title = Efficacy and Safety of Sildenafil Treatment in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension: a Systematic Review | journal = Respiratory Medicine | date = March 2014 | volume = 108 | issue = 3 | pages = 513–17 | doi = 10.1016/j.rmed.2014.01.003 | pmid = 24462476 | url = http://www.resmedjournal.com/article/S0954-6111(14)00023-7/pdf | accessdate = 5 November 2016}}</ref>

===Altitude sickness===
Sildenafil appears to improve some risk factors for [[high-altitude pulmonary edema]] but it is unclear whether or not it affects the rate of the condition itself as of 2008.<ref name="Stream">{{cite journal | last1 = Stream | first1 = JO | last2 = Grissom | first2 = CK | title = Update on High-Altitude Pulmonary Edema: Pathogenesis, Prevention, and Treatment | journal = Wilderness & Environmental Medicine | date = 2008 | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 293–303 | doi = 10.1580/07-WEME-REV-173.1 | pmid = 19099331 }}</ref>

Sildenafil and other [[PDE5 inhibitor]]s have moderate efficacy for treating secondary [[Raynaud's phenomenon]].<ref name="Raynaud's treatment - sildenafil + other PDE5 inhibitors">{{cite journal | vauthors = Roustit M, Blaise S, Allanore Y, Carpentier PH, Caglayan E, Cracowski JL | title = Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors for the treatment of secondary Raynaud's phenomenon: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials | journal = Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases | volume = 72 | issue = 10 | pages = 1696–99 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 23426043 | doi = 10.1136/annrheumdis-2012-202836 | quote = PDE-5 inhibitors appear to have significant but moderate efficacy in secondary [Raynaud's phenomenon]. }}</ref><ref name="Raynaud's treatments">{{cite journal | vauthors = Linnemann B, Erbe M | title = Raynaud's phenomenon and digital ischaemia – pharmacologic approach and alternative treatment options | journal = VASA | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 201–12 | date = 2016 | pmid = 27129065 | doi = 10.1024/0301-1526/a000526 | quote = Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil) can also improve [Raynaud's phenomenon] symptoms and ulcer healing }}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
In [[clinical trial]]s, the most common [[Adverse drug reaction|adverse effects]] of sildenafil use included [[headache]], [[Flushing (physiology)|flushing]], [[indigestion]], [[nasal congestion]], and impaired vision, including [[photophobia]] and blurred vision.<ref name=PI /> Some sildenafil users have complained of seeing everything tinted blue ([[cyanopsia]]).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.visionweb.com/content/consumers/dev_consumerarticles.jsp?RID=85 | title = Viagra and Vision | date = 29 October 2001 | publisher = VisionWeb | accessdate = 5 November 2016}}</ref> Some complained of blurriness and loss of [[peripheral vision]]. In July 2005, the FDA found that sildenafil could lead to vision impairment in rare cases<ref>{{cite web | title = FDA Updates Labeling for Viagra, Cialis and Levitra for Rare Post-Marketing Reports of Eye Problems | url = http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2005/ucm108458.htm | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration | accessdate=5 November 2016 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161022204628/http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2005/ucm108458.htm | archivedate = 22 October 2016 | date = 8 July 2005}}</ref> and a number of studies have linked sildenafil use with [[Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy|non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy]].<ref name="Laties">{{cite journal | last1 = Laties | first1 = AM | title = Vision Disorders and Phosphodiesterase Type 5 Inhibitors: a Review of the Evidence to Date | journal = Drug safety | date = January 2009 | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages=1–18 | doi = 10.2165/00002018-200932010-00001 | pmid = 19132801 }}</ref>

Rare but serious adverse effects found through [[postmarketing surveillance]] include [[Priapism|prolonged erections]], severe [[Hypotension|low blood pressure]], [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack), [[Ventricular tachycardia|ventricular arrhythmias]], [[stroke]], increased [[intraocular pressure]], and sudden [[hearing loss]].<ref name=PI /> In October 2007, the FDA announced that the labeling for all [[PDE5]] inhibitors, including sildenafil, required a more prominent warning of the potential risk of sudden hearing loss.<ref>{{cite web | title = FDA Announces Revisions to Labels for Cialis, Levitra and Viagra | url = http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2007/ucm109012.htm | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration | accessdate = 5 November 2016 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161022203200/http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2007/ucm109012.htm | archivedate = 22 October 2016 | date = 18 October 2007}}</ref>

===Interactions===
Care should be exercised by people who are also taking [[Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitors]] for the treatment of [[HIV/AIDS|HIV infection]]. Protease inhibitors inhibit the metabolism of sildenafil, effectively multiplying the plasma levels of sildenafil, increasing the incidence and severity of side effects. Those using protease inhibitors are recommended to limit their use of sildenafil to no more than one 25 mg dose every 48 hours.<ref name=PI /> Other drugs that interfere with the metabolism of sildenafil include [[erythromycin]] and [[cimetidine]], both of which can also lead to prolonged plasma half-life levels.

The use of sildenafil and an [[Alpha-1 blocker|α<sub>1</sub> blocker]] (typically prescribed for [[hypertension]] or for urologic conditions, such as [[benign prostatic hypertrophy]]) at the same time may lead to low blood pressure, but this effect does not occur if they are taken at least 4 hours apart.<ref name="Kloner">{{cite journal | last1 = Kloner | first1 = RA | title = Pharmacology and Drug Interaction Effects of the Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors: Focus on α-Blocker Interactions | journal = The American Journal of Cardiology | date = 26 December 2005 | volume = 96 | issue = 12 (Suppl. 2) | pages = 42–46 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjcard.2005.07.011 | pmid = 16387566 }}</ref>

===Analogs===
[[Acetildenafil]] and other synthetic [[structural analog]]s of sildenafil which are [[cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5|PDE5 inhibitors]] have been found as adulterants in a number of "herbal" aphrodisiac products sold over-the-counter.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jpba.2012.02.014 |vauthors=Venhuis BJ, de Kaste D | title = Towards a decade of detecting new analogues of sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil in food supplements: a history, analytical aspects and health risks | journal = Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis |year = 2006–2012 | volume=69 | pages=196–208 | pmid=22464558}}</ref> These analogs have not undergone any of the rigorous testing that drugs like sildenafil have passed, and thus have unknown side-effect profiles.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/15287390600751355 | vauthors = Oh SS, Zou P, Low MY, Koh HL | title = Detection of sildenafil analogues in herbal products for erectile dysfunction | journal = Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health Part A |year = 2006 | volume=69 | issue=21 | pages=1951–58 | pmid=16982533}}</ref> Some attempts have been made to ban these drugs, but progress has been slow so far, as, even in those jurisdictions that have laws targeting designer drugs, the laws are drafted to ban analogs of illegal drugs of abuse, rather than analogs of prescription medicines.

==Detection in biological fluids==
Sildenafil and/or N-desmethylsildenafil, its major active metabolite, may be quantified in plasma, serum, or whole blood to assess pharmacokinetic status in those receiving the drug therapeutically, to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims, or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdose.<ref>R.

Sildenafil protects [[cyclic guanosine monophosphate]] (cGMP) from degradation by [[cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5]] (PDE5) in the [[corpus cavernosum penis|corpus cavernosum]]. [[Nitric oxide]] (NO) in the corpus cavernosum of the penis binds to [[guanylate cyclase]] receptors, which results in increased levels of cGMP, leading to [[smooth muscle]] relaxation ([[vasodilation]]) of the intimal cushions of the [[Helicine arteries of penis|helicine arteries]]. This smooth muscle relaxation leads to vasodilation and increased inflow of blood into the spongy tissue of the penis, causing an erection.<ref name="WebbDJ">{{cite journal|author1=Webb, D.J. |author2=Freestone, S. |author3=Allen, M.J. |author4=Muirhead, G.J. |title=Sildenafil citrate and blood-pressure-lowering drugs: results of drug interaction studies with an organic nitrate and a calcium antagonist|date=March 4, 1999|journal=Am.

Furchgott]], [[Ferid Murad]], and [[Louis Ignarro]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1998 for their independent study of the metabolic pathway of nitric oxide in smooth muscle vasodilation.

Sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of [[cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5]] (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the [[corpus cavernosum penis|corpus cavernosum]]. The molecular structure of sildenafil is similar to that of cGMP and acts as a competitive binding agent of PDE5 in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in more cGMP and better erections.<ref name="WebbDJ"/> Without sexual stimulation, and therefore lack of activation of the NO/cGMP system, sildenafil should not cause an erection. Other drugs that operate by the same mechanism include [[tadalafil]] (Cialis) and [[vardenafil]] (Levitra).

Sildenafil is broken down in the liver by hepatic metabolism using cytochrome p450 enzymes, mainly CYP450 3A4(major route), but also by CYP2C9 (minor route) hepatic isoenzymes. The major product of metabolisation by these enzymes is N-desmethylated sildenafil, which is metabolised further. This metabolite also has an affinity for the PDE receptors, about 40% of that of sildenafil. Thus, the metabolite is responsible for about 20% of sildenafil's action. Sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (about 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (around 13% of the administered oral dose).  If taken with a high-fat meal, absorption is reduced; the time taken to reach the maximum plasma concentration increases by around one hour, and the maximum concentration itself is decreased by nearly one-third.<ref name=RxListCP>{{cite web| url = http://www.rxlist.com/viagra-drug/clinical-pharmacology.htm | title = Viagra Clinical Pharmacology | year = 2008 | accessdate = 2008-08-20 | publisher = RxList.com}}</ref>

==History==
Sildenafil (compound UK-92,480) was synthesized by a group of pharmaceutical chemists working at Pfizer's [[Sandwich, Kent]], research facility in England. It was initially studied for use in [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure) and [[angina pectoris]] (a symptom of [[ischaemic heart disease]]). The first clinical trials were conducted in [[Morriston Hospital]] in [[Swansea]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Research | url=http://www.abm.university-trust.wales.nhs.uk/page.cfm?orgId=743&pid=29457 | date= 4 July 2008 | accessdate=6 August 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080926034946/http://www.abm.university-trust.wales.nhs.uk/page.cfm?orgId=743&pid=29457|deadurl = yes|archivedate = 26 September 2008|publisher = Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board|website = ABM|quote = Our clinicians regularly offer patients the opportunity to take part in trials of new drugs and treatments.
