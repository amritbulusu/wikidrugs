The drug is the first anti-CD74 antibody that has entered into human testing and is currently being studied for the treatment of [[multiple myeloma]]. Milatuzumab has received [[orphan drug]] designation from the Food and Drug Administration in the United States for the treatment of [[multiple myeloma]] and [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]].

Milatuzumab was developed by [http://www.immunomedics.com Immunomedics, Inc], (Morris Plains NJ USA).

{{Refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
[[CD74]] is present on a variety of hematological tumors and even on some solid cancers. It is present in limited amounts in normal tissues but widely found in leukemias, lymphomas and the vast majority of multiple myeloma cases.{{cn|date=November 2015}} CD74 is involved in a cell-to-cell communication pathway that is critical for survival.{{cn|date=November 2015}} When CD74 is blocked by milatuzumab, it can lead to cell death.

CD74 is an attractive target for a drug conjugate because of its rapid internalizing property.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

;hLL1-Dox: Milatuzumab has been linked to [[doxorubicin]] to form an [[antibody-drug conjugate]] or ADC (known as hLL1-Dox or IMMU-110) for treatment of relapsed [[multiple myeloma]]. A phase I/II clinical trial has started (in 2010).<ref>Milatuzumab-Doxorubicin (IMMU-110 / hLL1-dox) Clinical Trials - ADC Review / Journal of Antibody-drug Conjugates [http://adcreview.com/multiple-myeloma-immu-110-clinical-trials/]</ref><ref>[http://www.news-medical.net/news/20100616/Immunomedics-initiates-dosing-in-milatuzumab-doxorubicin-conjugate-Phase-III-trial-for-relapsed-multiple-myeloma.aspx Immunomedics initiates dosing in milatuzumab-doxorubicin conjugate Phase I/II trial for relapsed multiple myeloma - News Medical and Immunomedics Press Release.  |date=16 June 2010 ]</ref>  This open-label, multi-center Phase I/II study aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability of milatuzumab-doxorubicin conjugate in patients with recurrent or refractory multiple myeloma, and to obtain preliminary information on efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity. The ADC will be administered intravenously on days 1, 4, 8, & 11 every 21 days for up to 8 treatment cycles.  Four different dose levels of the doxorubicin conjugate of milatuzumab will be studied in groups of 3-6 patients.  Once an optimal dose has been found, up to an additional 30 patients will be studied at that dose level. The study is due to complete in July 2013<ref name=NCT01101594>[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01101594 A Study of hLL1-DOX (Milatuzumab-Doxorubicin Antibody-Drug Conjugate) in Patients With Multiple Myeloma.
