Etifoxine seems to have been mischaracterized in the 1960-70's as a mild or partial benzodiazepine, because of its lack of typical benzodiazepine side effects, like sedation and ataxia. Thus, it was deemed to be noncompetitive with benzodiazepine drugs of the time, like Valium, and not introduced into world markets. Not until the 2000s was it discovered that etifoxine worked through completely different mechanisms, i.e.. GABA(A) beta subtype selectivity and neurosteroid biosynthesis (purported to work through TSPO). Realization of the MOA has led to its investigation in a number of preclinical studies as an analgesic, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotectant. Recent publications have chronicled its efficacy as a microglia modulator in models of MS and ICH.

The original composition of matter patent for etifoxine has expired decades ago, however the S-enantiomer (US8110569 B2) and metabolically stabilized deuterium substituted variants have been recently identified in the patent literature (WO2016154039 A1). The deuterium variants retain the biological activity of etifoxine, but improve on the pharmacokinetic profile, allowing for less frequent and/or lower dosing than the original.

==Side effects==

The most common adverse effect is mild drowsiness at initial dosing. It is not associated with any withdrawal syndromes or dependence, and is not scheduled in France. In conclusion, etifoxine shows less adverse effects of anterograde amnesia, sedation, impaired psychomotor performance, and withdrawal syndromes than those of benzodiazepines Etifoxine for Pain Patients with Anxiety<ref>{{cite journal |pmc=4293506|year=2015|author1=Choi|first1=Y.

Contrary to comments in non-refereed on line journals, the committee found (for a ten-year pharmacovigilance period) that safety concerns were rare or very rare and that the incidence of idiosyncratic hepatic problems were very rare (less than drugs like Lipitor).http://ansm.sante.fr/var/ansm_site/storage/original/application/56a2e1cb1dbc986720da09842df11c22.pdf

==Mechanism of action==
Unlike benzodiazepines, etifoxine appears to produce its anxiolytic effects by activating  β2 and β3 subunit containing channels of the [[GABA A receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub>]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] complex (a different binding site than benzodiazepines), and by stimulating the production of GABA(A) active neurosteroids that act in conjunction with etifoxine's direct effects.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hamon A, Morel A, Hue B, Verleye M, Gillardin JM | title =  The modulatory effects of the anxiolytic etifoxine on GABA(A) receptors are mediated by the beta subunit | journal = Neuropharmacology | date = 2003 | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 293–303 | doi=10.1016/s0028-3908(03)00187-4| pmid =  12871647 }}</ref> This difference in binding means that etifoxine can be used alongside benzodiazepines to potentiate their effects without competing for binding sites;<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kruse HJ, Kuch H | title = Potentiation of clobazam's anticonvulsant activity by etifoxine, a non-benzodiazepine tranquilizer, in mice.
