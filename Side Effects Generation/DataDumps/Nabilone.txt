'''Nabilone''' is a [[synthetic cannabinoid]] with [[Medical cannabis|therapeutic use]] as an [[antiemetic]] and as an adjunct [[analgesic]] for [[neuropathic pain]]. It mimics [[tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC), the primary psychoactive compound found naturally occurring in ''[[Cannabis]]''.<ref name=USlabel2006>{{cite web|title=Nabilone label |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2006/018677s011lbl.pdf |publisher=FDA|date=May 2006}}</ref>

The FDA in the USA has indicated nabilone for chemotherapy-induced nausea/vomiting. In other countries, such as Canada, it is widely used  as an adjunct therapy for [[pain management|chronic pain management]]. Numerous trials and case studies have demonstrated modest effectiveness for relieving [[fibromyalgia]]<ref name=pain/> and [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref>{{npsn|date=January 2014}}{{cite journal |type=Research article  |vauthors=Wissel J, etal |title=Low dose treatment with the synthetic cannabinoid Nabilone significantly reduces spasticity-related pain : a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over trial |journal= J Neurol. |volume=253 |issue=10 |pages=1337–41 |year=2006 |pmid=16988792|doi=10.1007/s00415-006-0218-8}}</ref>

Nabilone is a [[racemic mixture]] consisting of (''S'',''S'')-(+)- and (''R'',''R'')-(−)-[[isomer]]s ([[Cis-trans isomerism|''cis''-''trans'' isomerism]]).

==Medical uses==
Nabilone is used to treat nausea and vomiting in people under [[chemotherapy]].<ref name=USlabel2006/><ref name=UKlabel2014>{{cite web|title=Nabilone Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) - (eMC)|url=https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/20515|publisher=UK Electronic Medicines Compendium|date=August 2014}}</ref>

The main settings that have seen published clinical trials of nabilone include movement disorders such as [[parkinsonism]], chronic pain, [[dystonia]] and [[spasticity]] neurological disorders, multiple sclerosis, and the nausea of cancer chemotherapy. Nabilone is also effective in the treatment of [[inflammatory bowel disease]], especially [[ulcerative colitis]]. [[Medical cannabis]] patients report that nabilone is more similar in effect to [[cannabidiol]] (CBD) than [[tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC), indicating that it has more of a therapeutic effect on the body than a "high" effect on the mind.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

A study comparing nabilone with [[metoclopramide]], conducted before the development of modern [[5-HT3 antagonist|5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonist]] [[anti-emetics]] such as [[ondansetron]], revealed that patients taking [[cisplatin]] chemotherapy preferred [[metoclopramide]], while patients taking [[carboplatin]] preferred nabilone to control nausea and vomiting.<ref>{{npsn|date=January 2014}}{{cite journal |type=Randomized controlled trial  |vauthors=Cunningham D, etal |title=A randomized trial of oral nabilone and prochlorperazine compared to intravenous metoclopramide and dexamethasone in the treatment of nausea and vomiting induced by chemotherapy regimens containing cisplatin or cisplatin analogues |journal=Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=685–9 |year=1988 |pmid=2838294 |doi=10.1016/0277-5379(88)90300-8}}</ref>

=== Research ===
Nabilone is sometimes used for nightmares in PTSD, but there have not been studies longer than nine weeks, so effects of longer term use are not known.<ref name=CADTH-2015>{{cite journal|last1=Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health|title=Long-term Nabilone Use: A Review of the Clinical Effectiveness and Safety|journal=CADTH Rapid Response Reports|date=Oct 2015|pmid=26561692|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0079568/|accessdate=19 November 2015}}</ref> Nabilone has also been used for medication overuse headache.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Nabilone for the treatment of medication overuse headache: results of a preliminary double-blind, active-controlled, randomized trial|journal = The Journal of Headache and Pain|date = 2012-11-01|issn = 1129-2377|pmc = 3484259|pmid = 23070400|pages = 677–684|volume = 13|issue = 8|doi = 10.1007/s10194-012-0490-1|first = Luigi Alberto|last = Pini|first2 = Simona|last2 = Guerzoni|first3 = Maria Michela|last3 = Cainazzo|first4 = Anna|last4 = Ferrari|first5 = Paola|last5 = Sarchielli|first6 = Ilaria|last6 = Tiraferri|first7 = Michela|last7 = Ciccarese|first8 = Maurizio|last8 = Zappaterra}}</ref>

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Nabilone is given in 1 or 2&nbsp;mg doses multiple times a day up to a total of 6&nbsp;mg.  It is completely absorbed from oral administration and highly plasma protein bound. Multiple P450 enzymes extensively metabolize nabilone to various metabolites that have not been fully characterized.<ref name=USlabel2006/>

==Adverse effects==
Nabilone can increase—rather than decrease—post-operative pain. In the treatment of fibromyalgia, adverse effects limits the useful dose.<ref name=pain/> Adverse effects of nabilone include, but are not limited to: dizziness/vertigo, euphoria, drowsiness, dry mouth, [[ataxia]], sleep disturbance, [[dysphoria]], headache, nausea, [[disorientation]], [[depersonalization]], [[asthenia]].<ref name=USlabel2006/>

==Society and culture==
Nabilone was originally developed by [[Eli Lilly and Company]]; Lilly received FDA approval in 1985 to market it, but withdrew that approval in 1989 for commercial reasons.<ref name=PT2006>{{cite news|title=Valeant returns synthetic cannabinoid to USA|url=http://www.pharmatimes.com/news/valeant_returns_synthetic_cannabinoid_to_usa_996830|work=Pharma Times|date=17 May 2006|language=en}}</ref>  [[Valeant Pharmaceuticals]] acquired the rights from Lilly in 2004.<ref name=PT2006/>  Valeant tried and failed to get the drug approved in 2005<ref>{{cite news|title=FDA turns down Valeant's anti-nausea drug|url=http://www.pharmatimes.com/news/fda_turns_down_valeants_anti-nausea_drug_995867|work=Pharma Times|date=3 January 2006|language=en}}</ref> and then succeeded in 2006.<ref name=PT2006/>

In 2007 Valeant acquired the UK and EU rights to market nabilone from Cambridge Laboratories.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cambridge Labs divests nabilone to Valeant - Pharmaceutical industry n|url=http://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/cambridge-labs-divests-nabilone-to-valeant|work=The Pharma Letter|date=February 27, 2007}}</ref>

Nabilone was approved in Austria to treat chemotherapy-induced nausea in 2013; it was already approved in Spain for the same indication and was legal in Belgium to treat glaucoma, spasticity in Multiple Sclerosis, wasting from AIDS, and chronic pain.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cannabis Laws & Scheduling in Europe - MedicalMarijuana.eu|url=http://www.medicalmarijuana.eu/legal/|website=MedicalMarijuana.eu|accessdate=17 November 2016}}</ref>
