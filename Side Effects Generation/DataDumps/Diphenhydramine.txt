== Adverse effects ==
The most prominent side effect is sedation. A typical dose creates driving impairment equivalent to a blood-alcohol level of 0.10 which is higher than the 0.08 limit of most drunk driving laws.<ref name=2007rev/>

Diphenhydramine is a potent [[anticholinergic]] agent. This activity is responsible for the [[adverse drug reaction|side effects]] of dry mouth and throat, [[tachycardia|increased heart rate]], [[mydriasis|pupil dilation]], [[urinary retention]], constipation, and, at high doses, hallucinations or [[delirium]]. Other side effects include motor impairment ([[ataxia]]), flushed skin, blurred vision at nearpoint owing to lack of accommodation ([[cycloplegia]]), abnormal sensitivity to bright light ([[photophobia]]), sedation, difficulty concentrating, short-term memory loss, visual disturbances, irregular breathing, dizziness, irritability, itchy skin, confusion, increased body temperature (in general, in the hands and/or feet), temporary [[erectile dysfunction]], and excitability, and although it can be used to treat nausea, higher doses may cause vomiting.<ref name="diph effects">{{cite web | url = http://www.drugs.com/sfx/diphenhydramine-side-effects.html | title = Diphenhydramine Side Effects | publisher = Drugs.com | accessdate = 6 April 2009 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090124235224/http://www.drugs.com/sfx/diphenhydramine-side-effects.html | archivedate = 24 January 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Some side effects, such as [[Fasciculation|twitching]], may be delayed until the drowsiness begins to cease and the person is in more of an awakening mode.
