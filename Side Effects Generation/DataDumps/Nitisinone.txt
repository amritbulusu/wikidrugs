'''Nitisinone''' ([[international nonproprietary name|INN]]), also known as '''NTBC''' (an abbreviation of its full [[chemical nomenclature|chemical name]]) is a [[pharmaceutical drug|medication]] used to slow the effects of [[Tyrosinemia#Types|hereditary tyrosinemia type 1]].  Since its first use for this indication in 1991, it has replaced [[liver transplantation]] as the [[therapy#Lines of therapy|first-line treatment]] for this rare condition.  It is also being studied in the related condition [[alkaptonuria]]. It is marketed under the brand name '''Orfadin''' by the company [[Swedish Orphan Biovitrum]] (Sobi); it was first brought to market by Swedish Orphan International. It was originally developed as a candidate [[herbicide]].

==Uses==

[[Alkaptonuria]] is caused when an enzyme called homogentisic dioxygenase (HGD) is faulty, leading to a buildup of homogenisate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akusociety.org/what-is-alkaptonuria |title=What is Alkaptonuria? |publisher=Akusociety.org |date= |accessdate=2015-06-04}}</ref> [[Alkaptonuria]] patients treated with nitisinone produce far less HGA than those not treated (95% less in the urine),<ref name=pmid21620748/>  because nitisinone inhibits HPPD, resulting in less homogenisate accumulation. Clinical trials are ongoing to test whether nitisinone can prevent [[ochronosis]] experienced by older [[alkaptonuria]] patients.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==Adverse effects==
Nitisinone has several negative side effects; these include but are not limited to: bloated abdomen, dark urine, abdominal pain, feeling of tiredness or weakness, headache, light-colored stools, loss of appetite, weight loss, vomiting, and yellow-colored eyes or skin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/drug-information/DR601005/DSECTION=side-effects |title=Nitisinone (Oral Route) Side Effects |publisher=Mayoclinic.com |date=2015-04-01 |accessdate=2015-06-04}}</ref>

Research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has demonstrated that nitisinone can reduce urinary levels of HGA by up to 95% in patients with [[alkaptonuria]]. The primary parameter of the NIH trial was range of hip motion, for which the results were inconclusive.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Research done using alkaptonuric mice has shown that mice treated with nitisinone experience no [[ochronosis]] in knee joint cartilage.

==History==
Nitisinone was discovered as part of a program to develop a class of [[herbicides]] called [[P-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase inhibitor|HPPD inhibitors]]. It is a member of the benzoylcyclohexane-1,3-dione family of herbicides, which are chemically derived from a natural phytotoxin obtained from the Australian bottlebrush plant, [[Callistemon citrinus]].<ref>G. Mitchell, D.W. Bartlett, T.E. Fraser, T.R. Hawkes, D.C. Holt, J.K. Townson, R.A. Wichert Mesotrione: a new selective herbicide for use in maize Pest Management Science, 57 (2) (2001), pp. 120–128</ref> [[4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase|HPPD]] is essential in plants and animals for [[catabolism]], or breaking apart, of [[tyrosine]].<ref name=Moran>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.abb.2004.08.015|pmid=15581571|title=4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase|journal=Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics|volume=433|issue=1|pages=117–28|year=2005|last1=Moran|first1=Graham R.}}</ref>  In plants, preventing this process leads to destruction of [[chlorophyll]] and the death of the plant.<ref name=Moran/>  In [[toxicology]] studies of the herbicide, it was discovered that it had activity against HPPD in rats<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/taap.1995.1121|pmid=7597701|title=Inhibition of 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate Dioxygenase by 2-(2-Nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-cyclohexane-1,3-dione and 2-(2-Chloro-4-methanesulfonylbenzoyl)-cyclohexane-1,3-dione|journal=Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology|volume=133|issue=1|pages=12–9|year=1995|last1=Ellis|first1=M.K.|last2=Whitfield|first2=A.C.|last3=Gowans|first3=L.A.|last4=Auton|first4=T.R.|last5=Provan|first5=W.M.|last6=Lock|first6=E.A.|last7=Smith|first7=L.L.}}</ref> and humans.<ref>{{cite book|doi=10.1016/S0076-6879(87)42021-1|pmid=3037254|chapter=4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase from human liver|title=Metabolism of Aromatic Amino Acids and Amines|volume=142|pages=139–42|series=Methods in Enzymology|year=1987|last1=Lindstedt|first1=Sven|last2=Odelhög|first2=Birgit|isbn=978-0-12-182042-8|editor1-first=Seymour |editor1-last=Kaufman}}</ref>

In [[Type I tyrosinemia]], a different enzyme involved in the breakdown of tyrosine, [[fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase]] is mutated and doesn't work, leading to very harmful products building up in the body.<ref name=NORD>National Organization for Rare Disorders. [https://www.rarediseases.org/docs/Tyrosinemia2_3_11.pdf Physician’s Guide to Tyrosinemia Type 1]</ref> Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase acts on tyrosine after HPPD does, so scientists working on making [[herbicides]] in the class of [[P-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase inhibitor|HPPD inhibitors]] hypothesized that inhibiting HPPD and controlling tyrosine in the diet could treat this disease.  A series of small clinical trials attempted with one of their compounds, nitisinone, were conducted and were successful, leading to nitisinone being brought to market as an [[orphan drug]]  Swedish Orphan International,<ref name="pmid9728330"/> which was later acquired by [[Swedish Orphan Biovitrum]] (Sobi).

Sobi is now a part of the DevelopAKUre consortium. They are responsible for drug supply and regulatory support in the ongoing clinical trials that will test the efficiacy of nitisinone as a treatment for alkaptonuria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.developakure.eu/others/ |title=Others &#124; DevelopAKUre |publisher=Developakure.eu |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2015-06-04}}</ref> It is hoped that if the trials are successful, nitisinone could also be licensed for treatment of [[alkaptonuria]].<ref name="akusociety.org"/>

==Generic versions==
There is no generic version of Orfadin in G7 countries. Prior to the market authorization of MDK-Nitisinone in Canada, the only Nitisinone product available globally was Orfadin.<ref>Pr MDK-Nitisinone  Summary Basis of Decisions, Health Canada 2016. http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/prodpharma/sbd-smd/drug-med/sbd-smd-2016-mdk-nitisinone-190564-eng.php</ref> Until recently, Nitisinone was not approved in Canada where it was distributed for over 20 years via a Health Canada Special Access Program. In September 2016, MendeliKABS was granted approval of a Priority New Drug Submission (PNDS) by Health Canada for a bioequivalent generic version of Orfadin capsules (MDK-Nitisinone). In November 2016 Cycle Pharma was also granted approval of a PNDS by Health Canada for Nitisinone tablets that are bioequivalent to Orfadin capsules.<ref>Pr Nitisinone Tablets Regulatory Decision Summary Health Canada, 2016. http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/prodpharma/rds-sdr/drug-med/rds-sdr-nitisinone-tab-193770-eng.php</ref> SOBI was granted approval of a PNDS in December 2016.<ref>PrOrfadin Regulatory Decision Summary Health Canada, 2016. http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/prodpharma/rds-sdr/drug-med/rds-sdr-orfadin-193226-eng.php</ref>
