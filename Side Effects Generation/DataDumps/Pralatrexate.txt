'''Pralatrexate''' (brand name '''Folotyn''') is an anti-cancer therapy.<ref name="PR">[http://ir.allos.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=125475&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1277828&highlight], Allos Therapeutics Press Release, “Allos Therapeutics' Pralatrexate Demonstrates Anticancer Activity in Multiple Cancer Cell Lines”.</ref> It is the first drug approved as a treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma, or [[Peripheral_T-cell_lymphoma|PTCL]]<ref name="PR2">[http://ir.allos.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=125475&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1335492&highlight], Allos Therapeutics Press Release, “Allos Therapeutics' FOLOTYN(TM) First and Only FDA-Approved Therapy for Relapsed or Refractory Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma”.</ref> — a biologically diverse group of aggressive blood cancers that have a poor prognosis.<ref name="PR2"/>

==Approval==
Folotyn was approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in September 2009 under the FDA’s accelerated approval,<ref name="PR2"/> which allows for earlier approval of drugs that meet unmet medical needs.<ref name="PR3">[http://www.fda.gov/forconsumers/byaudience/forpatientadvocates/speedingaccesstoimportantnewtherapies/ucm128291.htm], FDA, “Fast Track, Accelerated Approval and Priority Review”.</ref> Pralatrexate injection is marketed in the U.S. under the name Folotyn by Spectrum Pharmaceuticals.<ref name="PR2"/> [[Clinical trials]] are currently underway to explore the potential of Folotyn in other blood related cancers and solid tumors.<ref name="PR4">[http://seekingalpha.com/article/203251-allos-therapeutics-inc-q1-2010-earnings-call-transcript], Allos Therapeutics, “Allos Therapeutics, Inc. Q1 2010 Earnings Call Transcript”.</ref>

==Mechanism==
Pralatrexate is an [[antifolate]] (a [[folate]] analogue metabolic inhibitor) designed to accumulate preferentially in [[cancer cells]].<ref name="PR"/> Based on preclinical studies, researchers believe that pralatrexate selectively enters cells expressing reduced folate carrier type 1 (RFC-1), a protein that is overexpressed on certain cancer cells compared to normal cells.<ref name="PR"/>

Antifolates, such as pralatrexate, are part of a group of compounds known as [[antimetabolites]] with structural similarity to naturally occurring molecules involved in DNA synthesis.<ref name="PR5">[http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display-old/article/10165/1166026], Psychiatric Times, “Principles of Oncologic Pharmacotherapy”.</ref> Cancer cells mistake antimetabolites for normal [[metabolites]]<ref name="PR5"/> allowing the compound to stop or slow critical enzymes involved in DNA synthesis which then triggers cell death.<ref name="PR"/> Because of their primary effect on DNA synthesis, the antimetabolites are most effective against actively dividing cells and are largely cell-cycle phase specific.<ref name="PR5"/>

==Discovery==
Research on this class of drugs began in the 1950s at [[SRI International]], where scientists were focused on developing new [[chemotherapies]] and antifolates that would be effective against [[tumor cells]].<ref name="PR"/>

In the late 1970s, researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center discovered that cancerous cells take in natural folate through a protein identified as plasma membrane transporter (now referred to as “reduced folate carrier type 1” or “RFC-1”).  Further research showed that when normal cells evolve into cancerous cells they often overproduce RFC-1 to ensure they get enough folate.<ref name="PR6">[http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/html/95988.cfm], Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Press Release, “FDA Approves Lymphoma Drug Developed at Memorial Sloan Kettering”.</ref>

A subsequent scientific collaboration was ultimately formed among SRI International, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and the Southern Research Institute with the intention of developing an antifolate with greater therapeutic selectivity – an agent that could be more effectively internalized into tumors (transported into the cells through RFC-1) and would be more toxic to cancer cells than normal cells.<ref name="PR6"/>

This collaboration, supported by the National Cancer Institute,<ref name="PR8">[http://www.cancer.gov/ncicancerbulletin/102009/page4], National Cancer Institute “NCI Cancer Bulletin: The Next Steps in Drug Development at NCI”.</ref> led to the identification of pralatrexate in the mid-1990s.  Pralatrexate was later licensed to Allos Therapeutics in 2002 for further development.<ref name="PR7">{{cite pressrelease|url=http://www.sri.com/newsroom/press-releases/fda-approves-pralatrexate|title=FDA Approves Pralatrexate for Treatment of Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma|publisher=[[SRI International]]|date=2009-09-25|accessdate=2013-07-10}}</ref> Allos Therapeutics, Inc. was acquired by Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. on September 5, 2012.
