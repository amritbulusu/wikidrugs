'''Olaflur''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], or '''amine fluoride 297''') is a [[fluoride]]-containing substance that is an ingredient of toothpastes and solutions for the prevention of [[dental caries]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Ganss | first1 = C. | last2 = Klimek | first2 = J. | last3 = Brune | first3 = V. | last4 = Schürmann | first4 = A. | title = Effects of Two Fluoridation Measures on Erosion Progression in Human Enamel and Dentine in situ | doi = 10.1159/000080587 | journal = Caries Research | volume = 38 | issue = 6 | pages = 561–566 | year = 2004 | pmid =  15528912| pmc = }}</ref> It has been in use since 1966. Especially in combination with [[dectaflur]], it is also used in the form of gels for the treatment of early stages of caries, sensitive [[human tooth|teeth]], and by [[dentist]]s for the refluoridation of damaged [[tooth enamel]].<ref name="AustriaCodex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2009|edition=2009/2010|isbn=3-85200-196-X|language=German}}</ref>

==Overdosage==
Overdosage leads to irritation of the [[oral mucosa]]. In especially sensitive persons, even standard doses of olaflur can cause irritation.<ref name="AustriaCodex" /> Like other fluoride salts, olaflur is toxic when given in high doses over an extended period of time. Especially in children, before the development of the [[permanent teeth]], overdosage can lead to [[dental fluorosis]], a discolouring and weakening of the enamel.<ref>{{Cite journal

==Interactions==
Because [[calcium fluoride]] is practically insoluble in water, calcium-containing drugs and food inhibit the action of olaflur.<ref name="AustriaCodex" />

==Chemistry and mechanism of action==
Olaflur is a salt consisting of an [[amine|alkyl ammonium]] cation and fluoride as the [[counterion]]. With a long [[lipophilic]] [[hydrocarbon]] chain, the cation has [[surfactant]] properties. It forms a film layer on the surface of teeth, which facilitates incorporation of fluoride into the enamel. The top layers of the enamel's primary mineral, [[hydroxylapatite]], are converted into the more robust [[fluorapatite]]. The fluoridation reaches only a depth of a few [[nanometre]]s, which has raised doubts whether the mechanism really relies on the formation of fluorapatite.<ref>{{cite journal| last1 = Müller | first1 = F.| last2 = Zeitz | first2 = C.| last3 = Mantz | first3 = H.| last4 = Ehses | first4 = K.

===Synthesis===
The synthesis of olaflur starts from cattle's [[tallow]].<ref name="Heckendorn" /> The contained [[fatty acid]]s, mainly [[stearic acid]] (C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>35</sub>COOH), are obtained by [[hydrolysis]], and then converted to the corresponding [[amide]]s, which in turn are [[Reduction (chemistry)|reduced]] catalytically to the [[primary amine]]s (largely octadecylamine). Addition of [[acrylonitrile]], followed by another reduction, yields ''N''-alkyl-1,3-propanediamines. The two nitrogen atoms react with [[ethylene oxide]] to form tertiary amines. Finally, [[hydrofluoric acid]] is added to give the end product. Because olaflur is produced from a mixture of fatty acids, some molecules have side chains that are longer or shorter than 18 carbon atoms. Other byproducts of the reaction include hydroxyethyl [[ether]]s resulting from addition of ethylene oxide to the free hydroxyl groups. The presence of these side products is clinically irrelevant.<ref name="Heckendorn">{{cite patent
