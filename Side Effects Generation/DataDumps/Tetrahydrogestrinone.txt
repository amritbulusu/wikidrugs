'''Tetrahydrogestrinone''' ('''THG'''), often referred to by its nickname '''The Clear''', is a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]], [[oral administration|orally active]] [[anabolic-androgenic steroid]] (AAS) which was never marketed.<ref>US Patent Application 2006/45847</ref><ref name=si/> It was developed by [[Patrick Arnold]] and was used by a number of high-profile athletes such as [[Marion Jones]] and [[Dwain Chambers]].

==Non-medical use==
THG was developed [[Clandestine chemistry|completely in secret]] by Arnold as a [[designer drug]], on the basis that doping testers would be unlikely to detect a totally new compound. Arnold developed a chemical similar to two obscure steroids marketed by BALCO, [[norbolethone]] and [[desoxymethyltestosterone]], which had been reported in scientific literature but never entered mass production, and the banned anabolic steroids [[trenbolone]] and [[gestrinone]], the latter of which was used to synthesize it.<ref name="Cotton">{{cite web|last1=Cotton|first1=Simon|title=Molecule of the month: THG|url=http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/THG/THGh.htm|publisher=[[University of Bristol]]|accessdate=3 September 2016}}</ref>

In 2003, whistleblower [[Trevor Graham]] passed a spent syringe containing a small amount of the drug to the [[United States Anti-Doping Agency]]. This was then transferred to the research group of pharmacologist [[Don Catlin]], who identified the drug using [[mass spectrometry]] techniques and gave it its present name.<ref name="Max Boxing">{{cite web|last1=Montoya|first1=Gabriel|title=Dr. Don Catlin on Anti-Doping in Boxing|url=http://www.maxboxing.com/news/max-boxing-news/dr-don-catlin-on-anti-doping-in-boxing|website=Max Boxing|accessdate=3 September 2016}}</ref><ref name="Tetrahydrogestrinone: discovery, synthesis, and detection in urine">{{cite journal|last1=Catlin|first1=Don H.|last2=Sekera|first2=Michael H.|last3=Ahrens|first3=Brian D.|last4=Starcevic|first4=Borislav|last5=Chang|first5=Yu-Chen|last6=Hatton|first6=Caroline K.|title=Tetrahydrogestrinone: discovery, synthesis, and detection in urine|journal=Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry|date=30 June 2004|volume=18|issue=12|pages=1245–1249|doi=10.1002/rcm.1495|accessdate=3 September 2016}}</ref>

===Mechanism of action===
When THG reaches the nucleus of a cell, it binds to the [[androgen receptor]] (AR) at the ligand-binding pocket. Here it changes the expression of a variety of genes, turning on several [[anabolic]] and [[androgenic]] functions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kicman AT |title=Pharmacology of anabolic steroids |journal=Br. J. Pharmacol. |volume=154 |issue=3 |pages=502–21 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18500378 |pmc=2439524 |doi=10.1038/bjp.2008.165}}</ref>

It is the [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]]'s structure which determines the number of interactions that can take place with the human androgen receptor ligand-binding domain. Even minor modifications in the ligand's structure have a great impact on the strength of the interactions this ligand has with the androgen receptor. THG, possessing a high affinity, establishes more van der Waals contacts with the receptor than with many other steroids. It is this higher affinity and specific geometry of THG which makes these interactions with the androgen receptor so strong, resulting in THG’s potency.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2174/1385272054038318 |vauthors=Thevis M, Schänzer W |title=Mass Spectrometry in Doping Control Analysis |journal=Current Organic Chemistry |volume=9 |pages=825–848 |year=2005 |issue=9 }}</ref>

THG, also known as '''17α-ethyl-18-methyl-δ<sup>9,11</sup>-19-nortestosterone''' or as '''17α-ethyl-18-methylestra-4,9,11-trien-17β-ol-3-one''', is a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]] [[estrane]] [[steroid]] and a [[17α-alkylated AAS|17α-alkylated]] [[chemical derivative|derivative]] of [[nandrolone]] (19-nortestosterone). It is a [[structural modification|modification]] of [[gestrinone]] (17α-ethynyl-18-methyl-19-nor-δ<sup>9,11</sup>-testosterone) in which the [[ethynyl group]] has been [[hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] into an [[ethyl group]], thereby converting the steroid from a [[norethisterone]] (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) derivative with weak AR activity into a [[norethandrolone]] (17α-ethyl-19-nortestosterone) derivative with powerful AR activity. THG is closely related to [[trenbolone]] (δ<sup>9,11</sup>-19-nortestosterone), [[metribolone]] (17α-methyl-δ<sup>9,11</sup>-19-nortestosterone), and [[norboletone]] (17α-ethyl-18-methyl-19-nortestosterone).

==History==
For a time, THG was considered the drug of choice for safe and "invisible" world record breaking in athletics, being used by several high-profile gold medal winners such as the sprinter [[Marion Jones]], who resigned from her athletic career in 2007 after admitting to using THG prior to the 2000 [[Sydney Olympics]], where she had won three gold medals.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7030170.stm | work=BBC News | title=Jones pleads guilty in drug case | date=2007-10-06 | accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref> It has also been used by formerly banned British athlete [[Dwain Chambers]] and Major League Baseball first baseman [[Jason Giambi]].<ref>{{cite news|work=San Francisco Chronicle |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/12/02/MNG80A523H1.DTL|title=Giambi admitted taking steroids|date=December 2, 2004|accessdate=May 25, 2007 | first1=Mark | last1=Fainaru-Wada | first2=Lance | last2=Williams}}</ref>

THG was developed by [[Patrick Arnold]] for the [[Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative]] (BALCO), which claimed to be a nutritional supplement company.<ref>http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/can/press/2006/2006_08_04_arnold_sentencing%20press.htm</ref> The company manufactured the drug through palladium-charcoal catalyzed hydrogenation from [[gestrinone]], a substance used in gynecology for treatment of [[endometriosis]] (Australian Medicines handbook 2011).

In 2003, U.S. sprint coach [[Trevor Graham]] delivered a syringe containing traces of THG to the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA). This helped Don Catlin, MD, the founder and then-director of the UCLA Olympic Analytical Lab, to identify and develop a test for THG, the second reported designer anabolic steroid.<ref>https://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/2007-02-28-catlin-drug-lab_N.htm ''[[USA Today]]'', 28 February 2007.</ref>
