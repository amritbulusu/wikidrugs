'''E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company''', commonly referred to as '''DuPont''', was an American [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] that was founded in July 1802 as a [[gunpowder]] mill by [[United States|American]] chemist and industrialist [[Éleuthère Irénée du Pont]].

In the 20th century, DuPont developed many [[polymer]]s such as [[Vespel]], [[neoprene]], [[nylon]], [[Corian]], [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]], [[Mylar]], [[Kapton]], [[Kevlar]], Zemdrain, [[M5 fiber]], [[Nomex]], [[Tyvek]], [[Sorona]], [[Artificial Leather#Corfam|Corfam]], and [[Lycra]]. DuPont developed [[Freon]] ([[chlorofluorocarbon]]s) for the [[refrigerant]] industry, and later more [[environmentally friendly]] refrigerants. It also developed [[synthetic pigment]]s and paints including [[ChromaFlair]].

In 2014, DuPont was the world's fourth largest chemical company based on [[market capitalization]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/70710ff2-fded-11e3-bd0e-00144feab7de.xls |publisher=[[The Financial Times]]  |title=2014 Global 500 companies ranked by sector |type=[[File:Microsoft Excel 2013 logo.svg|15px]] Excel Spreadsheet |date=June 27, 2014 |accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref> and eighth based on revenue.<ref name="icis2014">{{cite journal |url = http://img.en25.com/Web/ICIS/%7B182b8502-fa2d-4cd6-9ad7-133a3db38e16%7D_FC0432_CHEM_201409.pdf |work=ICIS Chemical Business Magazine  | publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] | title = The ICIS Top 100 Chemical  Companies |date=September 8–14, 2014 |pages=36 | accessdate =January 16, 2015}}</ref>. On August 31, 2017 it merged with [[The Dow Chemical Company]] to create [[DowDuPont Inc.]], the world's largest chemical company in terms of sales. Its stock price is a component of the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]].

==History==
[[File:Hagley DuPont Wagon.jpg|thumb|Original DuPont powder wagon]]
[[File:1905DuPontGunpowderMill.jpg|thumb|Working powder mills on [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine Creek]], about 1905]]

=== Establishment: 1802 ===
DuPont was founded in 1802 by [[Éleuthère Irénée du Pont]], using capital raised in France and gunpowder machinery imported from France. The company was started at the [[Eleutherian Mills]], on the [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine Creek]], near [[Wilmington, Delaware]], two years after he and his family left France to escape the [[French Revolution]] and religious persecutions against [[Huguenot]] protestants. The company began as a manufacturer of gunpowder, as du Pont noticed that the industry in North America was lagging behind Europe. The company grew quickly, and by the mid-19th century had become the largest supplier of gunpowder to the [[United States military]], supplying half the powder used by the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. The Eleutherian Mills site is now a museum and a [[National Historic Landmark]].

=== Expansion: 1902 to 1912 ===
DuPont continued to expand, moving into the production of [[dynamite]] and [[smokeless powder]]. In 1902, DuPont's president, [[Eugene du Pont]], died, and the surviving partners sold the company to three great-grandsons of the original founder. [[Charles Lee Reese]] was appointed as director and the company began centralizing their research departments.<ref>{{cite book|title=Class of 811 Graduated: Sketches of Honored Alumni|date=June 27, 1919|publisher=The Pennsylvania Gazette|location=Philadelphia, PA|page=875|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AgA9AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA875&lpg=PA875&dq=dupont+charles+lee+reese&source=bl&ots=jwoGf2L4gb&sig=FMfRayVADeT1_jb3KEQk0V5rUuA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=mWKnVKnxHomDoQTgt4GoCQ&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=dupont%20charles%20lee%20reese&f=false|accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref>  The company subsequently purchased several smaller chemical companies, and in 1912 these actions gave rise to government scrutiny under the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]. The courts declared that the company's dominance of the explosives business constituted a monopoly and ordered [[divestment]]. The court ruling resulted in the creation of the Hercules Powder Company (later [[Hercules Inc.]] and now part of [[Ashland Inc.]]) and the Atlas Powder Company (purchased by [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI) and now part of [[AkzoNobel]]).<ref>{{Cite journal

}}</ref> At the time of divestment, DuPont retained the single base [[nitrocellulose]] powders, while Hercules held the double base powders combining nitrocellulose and [[nitroglycerine]]. DuPont subsequently developed the [[Improved Military Rifle (IMR)]] line of [[smokeless powder]]s.<ref>Davis, William C., Jr. ''Handloading'' (1981) National Rifle Association {{ISBN|0-935998-34-9}} pp.31–33</ref>

In 1910, DuPont published a brochure entitled "Farming with Dynamite". The pamphlet was instructional, outlining the benefits to using their dynamite products on stumps and various other obstacles that would be easier to remove with dynamite as opposed to other more conventional and inefficient means.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/www/dupont/FarmingWithDynamite/|title=Farming with Dynamite|publisher=|accessdate=December 12, 2015}}</ref>

DuPont also established two of the first industrial laboratories in the United States, where they began the work on [[cellulose]] chemistry, [[lacquer]]s and other non-explosive products. [[DuPont Central Research]] was established at the [[DuPont Experimental Station]], across the [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine Creek]] from the original powder mills.

=== Automotive investments: 1914 ===
In 1914, [[Pierre S. du Pont]] invested in the fledgling automobile industry, buying stock in [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] (GM). The following year he was invited to sit on GM's board of directors and would eventually be appointed the company's chairman. The DuPont company would assist the struggling automobile company further with a $25 million purchase of GM stock. In 1920, Pierre S. du Pont was elected president of General Motors. Under du Pont's guidance, GM became the number one automobile company in the world. However, in 1957, because of DuPont's influence within GM, further action under the [[Clayton Antitrust Act]] forced DuPont to divest its shares of General Motors.

=== Major breakthroughs: 1920s–1930s ===

[[File:Aerial view of Duponts "Orlon" Plant, Camden, S. C.jpg|thumb|right|DuPont's Orlon plant in Camden, South Carolina, c. 1930–1945]]
In the 1920s, DuPont continued its emphasis on [[materials science]], hiring [[Wallace Carothers]] to work on [[polymers]] in 1928. Carothers invented [[neoprene]], a [[synthetic rubber]];<ref>John K. Smith.  [http://www.jstor.org/stable/3104528 The Ten-Year Invention: Neoprene and Du Pont Research, 1930–1939]. Technology and Culture 26(1):34–55 January 1985</ref> the first [[polyester]] super[[polymer]]; and, in 1935, [[nylon]].  The invention of [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] followed a few years later.  DuPont introduced [[phenothiazine]] as an [[insecticide]] in 1935.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clemson.edu/extension/pest_ed/histor.html |title=Achievements of Professional Entomology : Extension : Clemson University : South Carolina |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

=== Second World War: 1941 to 1945 ===

DuPont ranked 15th among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.<ref>[[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Peck, Merton J.]] & [[Frederic M. Scherer|Scherer, Frederic M.]] ''The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis'' (1962) [[Harvard Business School]] p.619</ref> As the inventor and manufacturer of [[nylon]], DuPont helped produce the raw materials for [[parachute]]s, powder bags,<ref>[http://invention.smithsonian.org/centerpieces/whole_cloth/u7sf/u7materials/act4_6.html "Hosiery Woes"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140212193825/http://invention.smithsonian.org/centerpieces/whole_cloth/u7sf/u7materials/act4_6.html |date=February 12, 2014 }}

DuPont also played a major role in the [[Manhattan Project]] in 1943, designing, building and operating the [[Hanford Site|Hanford]] [[plutonium]] producing plant in [[Hanford, Washington]]. In 1950 DuPont also agreed to build the [[Savannah River Plant]] in [[South Carolina]] as part of the effort to create a hydrogen bomb.

=== Space Age developments: 1950 to 1970 ===
After the war, DuPont continued its emphasis on new materials, developing [[Mylar]], [[Dacron]], [[Orlon]], and [[Lycra]] in the 1950s, and [[Tyvek]], [[Nomex]], [[Qiana]], [[Corfam]], and [[Corian]] in the 1960s. DuPont materials were critical to the success of the [[Apollo program|Apollo Project of the United States space program]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

DuPont has been the key company behind the development of modern [[body armour|body armor]]. In the [[Second World War]] DuPont's ballistic nylon was used by [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s [[Royal Air Force]] to make [[flak jacket]]s. With the development of [[Kevlar]] in the 1960s, DuPont began tests to see if it could resist a lead bullet. This research would ultimately lead to the [[Ballistic vest|bullet resistant vests]] that are the mainstay of police and military units in the industrialized world.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

=== Conoco holdings: 1981 to 1999 ===
In 1981, DuPont acquired [[Conoco Inc.]], a major American oil and gas producing company that gave it a secure source of petroleum feedstocks needed for the manufacturing of many of its fiber and plastics products. The acquisition, which made DuPont one of the top ten U.S.-based petroleum and natural gas producers and refiners, came about after a bidding war with the giant [[Distilled beverage|distillery]] [[Seagram|Seagram Company Ltd.]], which would become DuPont's largest single shareholder with four seats on the board of directors. On April 6, 1995, after being approached by Seagram Chief Executive Officer [[Edgar Bronfman Jr.]], DuPont announced a deal in which the company would buy back all the shares owned by Seagram.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.philly.com/1995-04-07/business/25684271_1_dupont-stake-seagram-shareholders-seagram-president |title=Seagram Co., Dupont Agree On Stock Sale The Chemical Firm Will Pay $8.8 Billion For 156 Million Shares That Seagram Has.

In 1999, DuPont sold all of its shares of Conoco, which merged with [[Phillips Petroleum Company]], and acquired the [[Pioneer Hi-Bred]] agricultural seed company.

===Chlorofluorocarbons===

Dupont, along with Frigidaire and General Motors, was a part of a collaborative effort to find a replacement for toxic refrigerants in the 1920s, resulting in the invention of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by Thomas Midgley in 1928.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/hats/publictn/elkins/cfcs.html|title=ESRL Global Monitoring Division - Halocarbons and other Atmospheric Trace Species|last=Laboratory|first=US Department of Commerce, NOAA, Earth System Research|website=www.esrl.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2017-02-15}}</ref> CFCs are [[ozone]]-depleting chemicals that were used primarily in [[aerosol spray]]s and [[refrigerant]]s.  DuPont was the largest CFC producer in the world with a 25 percent market share in the 1980s, totaling $600 million in annual sales.<ref name=LATimesCFC />

In 1974, responding to public concern about the safety of CFCs,<ref>[http://refrigerants.dupont.com/Suva/en_US/about/history/history_1970.html DuPont Refrigerants–History Timeline, 1970]. (URL accessed March 29, 2006).</ref> DuPont promised to stop production of CFCs should they be proven to be harmful to the ozone layer.

In February 1988, [[United States Senator]] [[Max Baucus]], along with two other Senators, wrote to DuPont reminding the company of its pledge.  The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that the letter was "generally regarded as an embarrassment for DuPont, which prides itself on its reputation as an environmentally conscious company."<ref name=LATimesCFC>{{cite web|title=Du Pont Will Stop Making Ozone Killers|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-03-25/news/mn-294_1_du-pont-s-announcement|website=LA Times|publisher=WashingtonPost}}</ref> The company responded with a strongly worded letter that the available evidence did not support a need to dramatically reduce CFC production and calling the proposal "unwarranted and counterproductive".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/26/business/behind-du-pont-s-shift-on-loss-of-ozone-layer.html?pagewanted=all |title=Behind Du Pont's Shift On Loss of Ozone Layer - NYTimes.com |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

On March 14 of the same year, scientists from the [[National Aeronautics and Space Agency]] announced the results of a study demonstrating a 2.3% decline in mid-latitude ozone levels between 1969 and 1986, along with evidence tying the decline to CFCs in the upper atmosphere.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1988/03/25/page/3/article/du-pont-acts-to-cut-ozone-decay |title=March 25, 1988 – Du Pont acts to cut ozone decay &#124; Chicago Tribune Archive |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> On March 24, DuPont reversed its position, calling the NASA results "important new information" and announcing that it would phase out CFC production.  The company further called for worldwide controls on CFC production and for additional countries to ratify the [[Montreal Protocol]]. DuPont's change of policy was widely praised by environmentalists.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/26/business/behind-du-pont-s-shift-on-loss-of-ozone-layer.html?pagewanted=allibune.com/1988/03/25/page/3/article/du-pont-acts-to-cut-ozone-decay |title=Behind Du Pont's Shift On Loss of Ozone Layer - NYTimes.com |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>  In 2003, DuPont was awarded the [[National Medal of Technology]], recognizing the company as the leader in developing CFC replacements.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3226779/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/scientists-technologists-win-honors/ |title=Scientists, technologists win honors – Technology & science – Science &#124; NBC News |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Unlike other persistent organic pollutants, [[Perfluorooctanoic acid]] persists indefinitely and is completely resistant to bio-degradation, remaining toxic. The only way to reduce levels in the body is by physical elimination rather than degradation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Olsen|first1=Geary|last2=Burris|first2=Jean|last3=Ehresman|first3=David|last4=Froehlich|first4=John|last5=Seacat|first5=Andrew|last6=Butenhoff|first6=John|last7=Zobel|first7=Larry|title=Half-Life of Serum Elimination of Perfluorooctanesulfonate, Perfluorohexanesulfonate, and Perfluorooctanoate in Retired Fluorochemical Production Workers|journal=Environ Health Perspect|date=2007|volume=115|issue=9|pages=1298–305|pmc=1964923|doi=10.1289/ehp.10009|pmid=17805419}}</ref> In 2014, the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] designated PFOA as "possibly carcinogenic" in humans.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Benbrahim-Tallaa L, Lauby-Secretan B, Loomis D, Guyton KZ, Grosse Y, El Ghissassi F, Bouvard V, Guha N, Mattock H, Straif K |title=Carcinogenicity of perfluorooctanoic acid, tetrafluoroethylene, dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloropropane, and 1,3-propane sultone |journal=Lancet Oncol. |volume=15 |issue=9 |pages=924–5 |year=2014 |pmid=25225686 |doi= 10.1016/s1470-2045(14)70316-x|url=}}</ref> One Ohio resident was awarded $1.6 million when a jury in 2015 found that her kidney cancer was caused by PFOA in drinking water.

===Imprelis===
In October 2010 DuPont began marketing a herbicide called [[Imprelis]], for control of certain plants in turf areas.  DuPont voluntarily pulled Imprelis from the market in August 2011 before the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a mandatory stop-sale order on Imprelis after being alerted of numerous reports from golf courses to nurseries that the product was suspected of injuring and, in some cases, killing trees. Norway spruce, white pines and honey locust proved to be among the species of trees that were susceptible.<ref name="DFP">Detroit Free Press, May 21, 2012, page A1</ref><ref>Howard Richman,  GCM Magazine May 2014: [https://www.gcsaa.org/gcm-magazine/2014/may/aftermath] Accessed January 17, 2017.</ref>

===Price fixing===
In 2005, the company plead guilty to fixing prices of chemicals and products that used [[polychloroprene|neoprene]], a synthetic rubber, resulting in an $84 million fine.<ref name=PriceFixing>{{cite web|title=DuPont, Dow unit fined for price fixing|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2005-01-20/business/0501200193_1_dupont-synthetic-rubber-guilty-to-fixing|website=Baltimore Sun|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=10 November 2015}}</ref>

==NASCAR sponsorship==
[[File:GordonbyDeanWissing.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jeff Gordon]]'s car with the DuPont Cromax Pro sponsorship]]
DuPont is widely known for its sponsorship of former four-time [[NASCAR]] [[Sprint Cup Series]] champion [[Jeff Gordon]] and his [[Hendrick Motorsports]] No. 24 [[Holden VF Commodore#NASCAR|Chevrolet SS]]. DuPont sponsored him since he began in Sprint Cup (then Winston Cup) in 1992. DuPont said this about their sponsorship:
<blockquote>Our sponsorship of Jeff Gordon helps keep DuPont brands and products in the public eye. Branding is a key component of the DuPont knowledge intensity strategy for achieving sustainable growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jeffgordon.com/sponsors/ |title=Sponsors |publisher=Jeffgordon.com |accessdate=September 19, 2011}}</ref></blockquote>

The partnership lasted 18 seasons before DuPont was replaced by [[AARP]] Drive to End Hunger as the No. 24 team's primary sponsor. DuPont continued as associate sponsor with a 12-race deal,<ref>{{cite web|last=Newton|first=David|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/nascar/cup/news/story?id=5733176|title=Jeff Gordon has 3-year sponsorship deal|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=October 28, 2010|accessdate=December 25, 2012}}</ref> and the deal was extended to 14 races after DuPont sold its performance coatings business, now known as "[[Axalta Coating Systems]]", to [[The Carlyle Group]]<ref name="Yahoo! Sports" /> in a deal worth $4.9 billion.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pappone|first=Jeff|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/new-cars/auto-news/motorsport-teams-and-sponsors-enjoy-a-mutually-beneficial-relationship/article11461261/|title=Motorsport teams and sponsors enjoy a mutually beneficial relationship|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=April 22, 2013|accessdate=December 4, 2013|location=Toronto}}</ref>

In addition to Gordon, DuPont sponsored [[Scott Lagasse]] in the [[SuperTruck Series presented by Craftsman]] during the 1995 season (including a one-off ride for [[Terry Labonte]] in the [[1995 Skoal Bandit Copper World Classic|Skoal Bandit Copper World Classic]], the inaugural Truck race).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/race/1995_Skoal_Bandit_Copper_World_Classic/C|title=1995 Skoal Bandit Copper World Classic|work=Racing-Reference|accessdate=October 26, 2015}}</ref> In the [[Busch Series]], the company sponsored [[Ricky Craven]]'s [[RC Racing]] team in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/rquery?id=craveri01&trk=t0&series=B|title=Ricky Craven: NASCAR Xfinity Series Results (races)|work=Racing-Reference|accessdate=November 6, 2015}}</ref>
