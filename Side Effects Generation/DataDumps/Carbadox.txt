'''Carbadox''' is a [[veterinary drug]] that combats bacterial infection in swine, particularly swine [[dysentery]].  In early 2004, it was banned by the [[Canadian government]] as a [[livestock]] feed additive and for human consumption, since it is carcinogenic and induces birth defects, as was shown in animal experiments.<ref>{{cite |url= http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/vet/faq/faq_mrl-lmr-eng.php#a6 |title= Maximum Residue Limits |publisher= Health Canada |accessdate= 2010-07-27}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=April 2016}} The European Union also forbids the use of carbadox at any level.<ref>{{cite web |last= Ungemach |first= Fritz R. |title= WHO Food Additives Series: 51 CARBADOX (addendum) |work= WHO Food Additives Series |publisher= INCHEM
