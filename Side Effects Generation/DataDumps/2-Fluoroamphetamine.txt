'''2-Fluoroamphetamine''' ('''2-FA''') is a [[stimulant]] drug from the [[amphetamine]] family which has been sold as a [[designer drug]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rösner | first1 = P | last2 = Quednow | first2 = B | last3 = Girreser | first3 = U | last4 = Junge | first4 = T | title = Isomeric fluoro-methoxy-phenylalkylamines: a new series of controlled-substance analogues (designer drugs) | journal = Forensic Science International | volume = 148 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 143–56 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15639609 | doi = 10.1016/j.forsciint.2004.05.003 }}</ref> 2-Fluoroamphetamine differs from [[3-Fluoroamphetamine|3-]] and [[4-Fluoroamphetamine|4-fluoroamphetamine]] in the position of the fluorine atom on the aromatic ring, making them [[positional isomer]]s of one another. The replacement of a hydrogen atom with a fluorine atom in certain compounds to facilitate passage through the [[blood–brain barrier]], as is desirable in [[central nervous system]] pharmaceutical agents, is a common practice due to the corresponding increase in [[lipophilicity]] granted by the substitute.<ref name="smartfluorine">{{cite journal |author=B.E.

==Pharmacology==
Anorexiant dose (amount inhibiting food intake by 50% for 2 hours, given 1 hour earlier) = 15&nbsp;mg/kg (rat; p.o.).<ref name = Costa>E. Costa and S. Garattini (1970) ''Amphetamines and Related Compounds'', p.28, New York: Raven Press.</ref>

Analgesic dose (50% inhibition of response to tail-clamp) = 20&nbsp;mg/kg (mouse; i.p.).<ref name = Costa/>

Effect on blood pressure: 0.5&nbsp;mg/kg (rat; i.v.) produces an increase in BP of 29&nbsp;mm.<ref name = Costa/>

==Toxicology==

==Legal Status==
===United States===
The Federal Analog Act, 21 U.S.C. § 813, is a section of the United States Controlled Substances Act, allowing any chemical "substantially similar" to an illegal drug (in Schedule I or II) to be treated as if it were also in Schedule I or II, but only if it is intended (ref 1) for human consumption. 2-FA may be considered to be an analog of amphetamine, thus falling under the Federal Analog Act.
===China===
As of October 2015 2-FA is a controlled substance in China.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sfda.gov.cn/WS01/CL0056/130753.html | title=关于印发《非药用类麻醉药品和精神药品列管办法》的通知 | publisher=China Food and Drug Administration | date=27 September 2015 | language=Chinese | accessdate=1 October 2015}}</ref>
