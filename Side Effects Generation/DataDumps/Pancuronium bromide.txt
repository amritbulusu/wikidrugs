'''Pancuronium''' (trademarked as '''Pavulon''') is an [[aminosteroid]] [[muscle relaxant]] with various medical uses. It is used in [[euthanasia]] and is the second of three drugs administered during most [[lethal injection]]s in the United States.

==Mechanism of action==
Pancuronium is a typical [[depolarization|non-depolarizing]] [[curare]]-mimetic [[muscle relaxant]]. It [[Competitive inhibition|competitively inhibits]] the [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]] at the [[neuromuscular junction]] by blocking the binding of [[acetylcholine]]. It has slight [[vagus nerve|vagolytic]] activity, causing an increase in heart rate,  but no [[ganglioplegic]] (i.e., blocking [[ganglion]]s) activity. It is a very potent muscle relaxant drug, with an [[Effective dose (pharmacology)|ED95]] (i.e., the dose that causes 95% depression of muscle twitch response) of only 60&nbsp;µg/kg body weight. Onset of action is relatively slow compared to other similar drugs, in part due to its low dose - an intubating dose takes 3–6 minutes for full effect. Clinical effects (muscle activity lower than 25% of physiological) last for about 100 minutes. The time needed for full (over 90% muscle activity) recovery after single administration is about 120–180 minutes in healthy adults. 
The effects of pancuronium can be at least partially reversed by [[cholinesterase inhibitor|anticholinesterasics]], such as [[neostigmine]], [[pyridostigmine]], and [[edrophonium]].

==Development==
Pancuronium is designed to mimic the action of two molecules of [[acetylcholine]] with the quaternary nitrogen atoms spaced rigidly apart by the steroid rings at a distance of ten atoms (interonium distance).
[[Decamethonium]] and [[suxamethonium]] also have this same interonium distance.

==Uses in medicine==
Pancuronium is used with [[general anesthesia]] in surgery for muscle relaxation and as an aid to [[intubation]] or ventilation. It does not have [[sedative]] or [[analgesic]] effects.

[[Adverse effect (medicine)|Side-effects]] include moderately raised [[heart rate]] and thereby [[arterial pressure]] and cardiac output, excessive [[saliva]]tion, [[apnea]] and [[respiratory depression]], [[rash]]es, [[Flushing (physiology)|flushing]], and [[sweating]].{{medcn|date=January 2016}} The muscular relaxation can be dangerous in the seriously ill and it can accumulate leading to extended weakness. Pancuronium is not preferable in long-term use in ICU-ventilated patients.

In [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], pancuronium is recommended in the protocol for [[euthanasia]]. After administering [[sodium thiopental]] to induce coma, pancuronium is delivered in order to stop breathing.<ref>

==Uses in execution and suicide==

===Procedure===
It is also used as one component of a [[lethal injection]] in administration of the [[death penalty]] in some parts of the [[United States of America|United States]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7350982.stm BBC article on lethal injection.] Small panel lists the chemicals used.</ref>

===Controversy===
Like all non-depolarising muscle relaxants, pancuronium has no effect on level of consciousness. Therefore, if the [[anaesthetic]] used is insufficient, the individual may be awake but unable to cry out or move due to the effect of the pancuronium. There have been several civil lawsuits alleging similar failures of adequate anaesthesia during general surgical procedures. These have been largely due to improper or insufficient dosages of [[anaesthetic]] in concert with normal dosages of muscle relaxants such as pancuronium.

In 2007, Michael Munro, a Scottish [[neonatologist]] at [[Aberdeen]] Maternity Hospital, was cleared of malpractice by the [[General Medical Council|GMC]] Fitness to Practice panel after giving 23 times the standard dose of pancuronium to two dying [[neonate]]s. In the final minutes of life, each baby was suffering from [[Agonal respiration|agonal gasping]] and violent body spasms, which was highly distressing for the parents to witness. Munro administered pancuronium to the babies after advising the parents that this would ease their suffering and could also hasten death.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/6291224.stm | work=BBC News | title=Baby doctor cleared of misconduct | date=2007-07-11 | accessdate=2010-05-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | title = Doctor cleared over baby deaths | date = 11 July 2007}}</ref> It is on record that neither of the children's parents was unhappy with Dr Munro's treatment of their babies.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/6276900.stm | work=BBC News | title=Doctor felt babies were suffering | date=2007-07-09 | accessdate=2010-05-21}}</ref>

[[Amnesty International]] has objected to its use in lethal injections on the grounds that it "may mask the condemned prisoner's suffering during the execution,"<ref>[http://web.amnesty.org/library/print/ENGAMR510242004 Amnesty International<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040517064412/http://web.amnesty.org/library/print/ENGAMR510242004 |date=May 17, 2004 }}</ref> thereby leading observers to conclude that lethal injection is painless, or less [[cruel and unusual punishment|cruel]] than other forms of execution.

===Export limitations===
The United Kingdom bans the export of pancuronium bromide to the United States.<ref>Article 4A of Export Control Order 2008 - provisions supplementing "the torture Regulation"</ref>

==Uses in crime==
Pancuronium was used in [[Efren Saldivar]]'s killing spree.<ref>[http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/angels/efren_saldivar/1.html?sect=9 Crimelibrary]</ref> It was also used by the [[Skin Hunters]] to kill patients in the [[Poland|Polish]] city of [[Łódź]]. Pavulon was also used by [[Richard Angelo]] in 1987 to kill at least 10 patients under his care at the Good Samaritan Hospital in New York.
