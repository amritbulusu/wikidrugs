'''Selective androgen receptor modulators''' or '''SARMs''' are a novel class of [[androgen]] receptor [[ligands]]. (The name follows the terminology currently used for similar molecules targeting the estrogen receptor, "[[selective estrogen receptor modulators]]," such as [[tamoxifen]].) They are intended to have the same kind of effects as androgenic drugs like [[anabolic steroid]]s but be much more selective in their action,<ref name="pmid19432422">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mohler ML, Bohl CE, Jones A, Coss CC, Narayanan R, He Y, Hwang DJ, Dalton JT, Miller DD | title = Nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs): dissociating the anabolic and androgenic activities of the androgen receptor for therapeutic benefit | journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 52 | issue = 12 | pages = 3597–617 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19432422 | doi = 10.1021/jm900280m }}</ref> allowing them to be used for many more clinical indications than the relatively limited legitimate uses that anabolic steroids are currently approved for.

==Comparison to testosterone==
Currently used androgens for male [[Androgen replacement therapy|hormone replacement therapy]] are typically injectable or skin delivery formulations of [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]] or testosterone esters. Injectable forms of testosterone esters (such as testosterone [[enanthate]], [[propionate]], or [[cypionate]]) produce undesirable fluctuations in testosterone blood levels, with overly high levels shortly after injection and overly low afterward. Skin patches do provide a better blood level profile of testosterone, but skin irritation and daily application still limit their usefulness.

SARMs provide the opportunity to design molecules that can be delivered orally, but that selectively target the androgen receptors in different tissues differently. The goal of research in this area is to allow a customized response: Tissues that are the target of the therapy will respond as they would to testosterone; other tissues where undesirable side-effects are produced will not.

None of the SARMs yet developed are truly selective for anabolic effects in muscle or bone tissues without producing any androgenic effects in tissues such as the prostate gland, however several [[nonsteroidal]] androgens show a ratio of anabolic to androgenic effects of greater than 3:1 and up to as much as 90:1 (RAD-140), compared to testosterone, which has a ratio of 1:1.<ref name="pmid12604714">{{cite journal | vauthors = Yin D, Gao W, Kearbey JD, Xu H, Chung K, He Y, Marhefka CA, Veverka KA, Miller DD, Dalton JT | title = Pharmacodynamics of selective androgen receptor modulators | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 304 | issue = 3 | pages = 1334–40 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12604714 | pmc = 2040238 | doi = 10.1124/jpet.102.040840 }}</ref><ref name="pmid14600402">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanada K, Furuya K, Yamamoto N, Nejishima H, Ichikawa K, Nakamura T, Miyakawa M, Amano S, Sumita Y, Oguro N | title = Bone anabolic effects of S-40503, a novel nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM), in rat models of osteoporosis | journal = Biological & Pharmaceutical Bulletin | volume = 26 | issue = 11 | pages = 1563–9 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14600402 | doi = 10.1248/bpb.26.1563 }}</ref><ref name="pmid17008401">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ostrowski J, Kuhns JE, Lupisella JA, Manfredi MC, Beehler BC, Krystek SR, Bi Y, Sun C, Seethala R, Golla R, Sleph PG, Fura A, An Y, Kish KF, Sack JS, Mookhtiar KA, Grover GJ, Hamann LG | title = Pharmacological and x-ray structural characterization of a novel selective androgen receptor modulator: potent hyperanabolic stimulation of skeletal muscle with hypostimulation of prostate in rats | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 148 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–12 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17008401 | doi = 10.1210/en.2006-0843 }}</ref>

This suggests that, while SARMs are likely to show some virilizing effects when used at high doses (e.g., use by bodybuilders), at lower therapeutic doses they may well be effectively selective for anabolic effects, which will be important if SARMs are to have clinical application in the treatment of osteoporosis in women. One substantial advantage of even the first-generation SARMs developed to date is that they are all orally active without causing liver damage, whereas most anabolic steroids are not active orally and must be injected, and those anabolic steroids that are orally active tend to cause dose-dependent liver damage, which can become life-threatening with excessive use. Research is continuing into more potent and selective SARMs, as well as optimising characteristics such as oral bioavailability and increased half-life ''in vivo'', and seeing as the first tissue-selective SARMs were only demonstrated in 2003, the compounds tested so far represent only the first generation of SARMs and future development may produce more selective agents compared to those available at present.<ref name="pmid17574413">{{cite journal | vauthors = Manfredi MC, Bi Y, Nirschl AA, Sutton JC, Seethala R, Golla R, Beehler BC, Sleph PG, Grover GJ, Ostrowski J, Hamann LG | title = Synthesis and SAR of tetrahydropyrrolo[1,2-b][1,2,5]thiadiazol-2(3H)-one 1,1-dioxide analogues as highly potent selective androgen receptor modulators | journal = Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters | volume = 17 | issue = 16 | pages = 4487–90 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17574413 | doi = 10.1016/j.bmcl.2007.06.007 }}</ref><ref name="pmid17636947">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang X, Li X, Allan GF, Sbriscia T, Linton O, Lundeen SG, Sui Z | title = Design, synthesis, and in vivo SAR of a novel series of pyrazolines as potent selective androgen receptor modulators | journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 50 | issue = 16 | pages = 3857–69 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17636947 | doi = 10.1021/jm0613976 }}</ref><ref name="pmid18400499">{{cite journal | vauthors = Long YO, Higuchi RI, Caferro TR, Lau TL, Wu M, Cummings ML, Martinborough EA, Marschke KB, Chang WY, López FJ, Karanewsky DS, Zhi L | title = Selective androgen receptor modulators based on a series of 7H-[1,4]oxazino[3,2-g]quinolin-7-ones with improved in vivo activity | journal = Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters | volume = 18 | issue = 9 | pages = 2967–71 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18400499 | doi = 10.1016/j.bmcl.2008.03.062 }}</ref>

===Selectivity in men===
For example, if the target is bone growth in elderly men with [[osteopenia]] or [[osteoporosis]], but with no overt signs of [[hypogonadism]], a SARM targeting bone and muscle tissue but with lesser activity on the prostate or testes would be more desirable.<ref name="pmid16340136">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ke HZ, Wang XN, O'Malley J, Lefker B, Thompson DD | title = Selective androgen receptor modulators--prospects for emerging therapy in osteoporosis? | journal = Journal of Musculoskeletal & Neuronal Interactions | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 355 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16340136 | doi =  | url = http://www.ismni.org/jmni/pdf/22/23THOMPSON.pdf }}</ref>

===Selectivity in women===
A SARM for women would ideally stimulate bone retention, or libido and other sexual function that androgens can influence, without negative side-effects such as development of male gender characteristics ([[virilization]]), increased [[LDL]]/[[High density lipoprotein|HDL]] ratios, liver dysfunction, and so forth.<ref name="pmid10522980">{{cite journal | vauthors = Negro-Vilar A | title = Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs): a novel approach to androgen therapy for the new millennium | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 84 | issue = 10 | pages = 3459–62 | date = October 1999 | pmid = 10522980 | doi = 10.1210/jc.84.10.3459 }}</ref>

In 2013, some supplement companies began selling various SARMs as supplements, in purported violation of both the Food and Drug Administration's [[Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994]] (DSHEA) and the intellectual property rights of the patent holders of the compounds.<ref>{{cite web|title=SARMs: The Controversial Muscle-Builders of 2015|url=https://blog.priceplow.com/sarms|website=The PricePlow Blog|accessdate=20 October 2015}}</ref>
