'''Zafirlukast''' is an oral [[leukotriene receptor antagonist]] (LTRA) for the maintenance treatment of [[asthma]], often used in conjunction with an inhaled steroid and/or long-acting bronchodilator. It is available as a tablet and is usually dosed twice daily. Another leukotriene receptor antagonist is [[montelukast]] (Singulair), taken once daily. [[Zileuton]] (Zyflo), also used in the treatment of asthma via its inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase, is taken four times per day.

Zafirlukast blocks the action of the cysteinyl [[leukotriene]]s on the CysLT1 [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]], thus reducing constriction of the [[airway]]s, build-up of [[mucus]] in the [[lungs]] and [[inflammation]] of the breathing passages.

Zafirlukast is marketed by [[Astra Zeneca]] with the brand names '''Accolate''', '''Accoleit''', and '''Vanticon'''. It was the first LTRA to be marketed in the USA and is now approved in over 60 countries, including the UK, Japan, Taiwan, Italy, Spain, Canada, Brazil, China and Turkey.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Healthy young men who received a single oral 40&nbsp;mg dose attained peak plasma zafirlukast concentrations that averaged 607 Î¼g/L at 3.4 hours. The elimination half-life ranged from 12 to 20 hours. In another study involving a 20&nbsp;mg single oral dose in healthy men, the elimination half-life averaged 5.6 hours.<ref>Fischer JD, Song MH, Suttle AB, Heizer WD, Burns CB, Vargo DL, Brouwer KL.

==Special warnings==
A letter was submitted to the FDA by Zeneca Pharmaceuticals on July 22, 1997, notifying them of a change in product labeling that includes the following potential reaction in patients undergoing a dosage reduction of oral steroids who are currently taking zafirlukast:

===Precautions===
Eosinophilic conditions: The reduction of the oral steroid dose, in some patients on zafirlukast therapy, has been followed in rare cases by the occurrence of eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy sometimes presenting as [[eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis]], a systemic eosinophilic vasculitis. Although a causal relationship with zafirlukast has not been established, caution is required when oral steroid reduction is being considered.
