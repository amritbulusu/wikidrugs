'''Aspartic acid''' (abbreviated as '''Asp''' or '''D'''; encoded by the codons [GAU and GAC]), also known as '''aspartate''', is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/910538334|title=Fundamentals of biochemistry : life at the molecular level|last=G.,|first=Voet, Judith|last2=W.,|first2=Pratt, Charlotte|isbn=9781118918401|oclc=910538334}}</ref> Similar to all other amino acids it contains an amino group and a carboxylic acid. Its α-amino group is in the protonated –NH{{su|b=3|p=+}} form under physiological conditions, while its α-carboxylic acid group is deprotonated −COO<sup>−</sup> under physiological conditions. Aspartic acid has an acidic side chain (CH<sub>2</sub>COOH) which reacts with other amino acids, enzymes and proteins in the body.<ref name=":1" /> Under physiological conditions (pH 7.4) in proteins the side chain usually occurs as the negatively charged aspartate form, −COO<sup>−</sup> .<ref name=":1" /> It is a non-[[essential amino acid]] in humans, meaning the body can [[De novo synthesis|synthesize it]] as needed.

D-Aspartate is one of two D-amino acids commonly found in mammals.[[Aspartic acid#cite note-3|<sup>[3]</sup>]].

In proteins aspartate sidechains are often hydrogen bonded to form [[asx turn]]s or [[asx motif]]s, which frequently occur at the N-termini of [[alpha helices]].

'''Asp''''s <small>L</small>-isomer is one of the 22 [[Proteinogenic amino acid|proteinogenic]] amino acids, i.e., the building blocks of [[protein]]s. '''Asp''' (and [[glutamic acid]]) is classified as acidic, with a [[PKa|pK<sub>a</sub>]] of 3.9, however in a peptide this is highly dependent on the local environment (as with all amino acids), and could be as high as 14. '''Asp''' is pervasive in biosynthesis.

==Discovery==
Aspartic acid was first discovered in 1827 by [[Auguste-Arthur Plisson]] and [[Étienne Ossian Henry]]<ref>{{cite book | title = Traité de chimie | volume = 3 | author1-first = Jöns Jakob | author1-last = Berzelius | author1-link = Jöns Jacob Berzelius | author2-first = Olof Gustaf | author2-last = Öngren | name-list-format = vanc | year = 1839 | language = French | publisher = A. Wahlen et Cie.| publication-place = Brussels | page = 81 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=szLPAAAAMAAJ | accessdate = 25 August 2015 }}</ref> by [[hydrolysis]] of [[asparagine]], which had been isolated from [[asparagus]] juice in 1806.<ref>{{cite book | first = R.H.A. | last = Plimmer | editor-first1 = R.H.A. | editor-last1 = Plimmer | editor-first2 = F.G. | editor-last2 = Hopkins | name-list-format = vanc | title = The chemical composition of the proteins | url = https://books.google.com/?id=7JM8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA112  |accessdate = January 18, 2010 | edition = 2nd | series =  Monographs on Biochemistry | volume = Part I. Analysis | origyear = 1908 | year = 1912 | publisher = Longmans, Green and Co. | location = London | page = 112 }}</ref> Their original method used [[lead hydroxide]], but various other acids or bases are more commonly used instead.

==Forms and nomenclature==
There are two forms or [[enantiomer]]s of aspartic acid. The name "aspartic acid" can refer to either enantiomer or a mixture of two.<ref name="IUPAC">{{IUPAC-IUB amino acids 1983}}.</ref> Of these two forms, only one, "<small>L</small>-aspartic acid", is directly incorporated into proteins. The biological roles of its counterpart, "<small>D</small>-aspartic acid" are more limited. Where enzymatic synthesis will produce one or the other, most chemical syntheses will produce both forms, "<small>DL</small>-aspartic acid," known as a [[racemic mixture]].

== Biosynthesis ==
Because Aspartate can be synthesized by the body it is classified as a non-essential amino acid. In the human body, aspartate is most frequently synthesized through the [[transamination]] of [[oxaloacetate]]. The biosynthesis of aspartate is facilitated by an [[aminotransferase]] enzyme: the transfer of an [[amine]] group from another molecule such as alanine or glutamine yields aspartate and an alpha-keto acid.<ref name=":1" />

Aspartate is also a byproduct of the urea cycle.

=== Chemical synthesis ===
[[Racemic]] aspartic acid can be synthesized from diethyl sodium phthalimidomalonate,
(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(CO)<sub>2</sub>NC(CO<sub>2</sub>Et)<sub>2</sub>).<ref>{{OrgSynth|last1=Dunn|first1=M. S.|last2=Smart|first2=B. W.|name-list-format=vanc|title=DL-Aspartic Acid|prep=CV4P0055|volume=30|pages=7|year=1950|collvol=4|collvolpages=55}}.</ref>

The major disadvantage of the above technique is that equimolar amounts of each enantiomer are made.  Using biotechnology it is now possible to use immobilised enzymes to create just one type of enantiomer owing to their stereospecificity.

==Metabolism==
In plants and [[microorganism]]s, aspartate is the precursor to several amino acids, including four that are essential for humans: [[methionine]], [[threonine]], [[isoleucine]], and [[lysine]]. The conversion of aspartate to these other amino acids begins with reduction of aspartate to its "semialdehyde," O<sub>2</sub>CCH(NH<sub>2</sub>)CH<sub>2</sub>CHO.<ref>{{Lehninger3rd|name-list-format = vanc }}</ref>  [[Asparagine]] is derived from aspartate via transamidation:
:-O<sub>2</sub>CCH(NH<sub>2</sub>)CH<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>-  +  ''G''C(O)NH<sub>3</sub>+   O<sub>2</sub>CCH(NH<sub>2</sub>)CH<sub>2</sub>CONH<sub>3</sub>+  +  ''G''C(O)O
(where ''G''C(O)NH<sub>2</sub> and ''G''C(O)OH are [[glutamine]] and [[glutamic acid]], respectively)

== Participation in the urea cycle ==
In the [[urea cycle]], aspartate and [[ammonia]] donate amino groups leading to the formation of [[urea]].

==Other biochemical roles==
Aspartate has many other biochemical roles. It is a [[metabolite]] in the [[urea cycle]] and participates in [[gluconeogenesis]]. It carries reducing equivalents in the [[malate-aspartate shuttle]], which utilizes the ready interconversion of aspartate and [[oxaloacetate]], which is the oxidized (dehydrogenated) derivative of [[malic acid]]. Aspartate donates one nitrogen atom in the biosynthesis of [[inosine]], the precursor to the [[purine]] bases. In addition, aspartic acid acts as hydrogen acceptor in a chain of ATP synthase.

===Neurotransmitter===
Aspartate (the [[conjugate base]] of aspartic acid) stimulates [[NMDA receptor]]s, though not as strongly as the amino acid neurotransmitter [[glutamic acid|L-glutamate]] does.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen PE, Geballe MT, Stansfeld PJ, Johnston AR, Yuan H, Jacob AL, Snyder JP, Traynelis SF, Wyllie DJ | title = Structural features of the glutamate binding site in recombinant NR1/NR2A N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors determined by site-directed mutagenesis and molecular modeling | journal = Molecular Pharmacology | volume = 67 | issue = 5 | pages = 1470–84 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15703381 | doi = 10.1124/mol.104.008185 | url = http://molpharm.aspetjournals.org/cgi/content/full/67/5/1470 }}</ref>

== Applications & market ==
As of 2014, the global market for aspartic acid is $117MM annually (50-60K MT/Yr)<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Evans J | title = Commercial Amino Acids | pages = 101–103 | publisher = BCC Research | year = 2014 |url= http://www.bccresearch.com/market-research/biotechnology/commercial-amino-acids-bio007k.html }}</ref> with potential areas of growth accounting for an {{clarify|text=addressable market|reason=Is this [[Total addressable market]] or [[Serviceable available market]]?|date=March 2017}} of $8.78BB.<ref name=":0">Transparency Market Research. Superabsorbent polymers market - global industry analysis, size, share, growth, trends and forecase, 2014-2020. (2014).</ref> The three largest market segments include the U.S., Western Europe, and China. Current applications include biodegradable polymers ([[polyaspartic acid]]), low calorie sweeteners ([[aspartame]]), scale and corrosion inhibitors, and resins.

Nearly all aspartic acid is manufactured in China.

===Superabsorbent polymers===

One area of aspartic acid market growth is [[biodegradable]] [[superabsorbent polymer]]s (SAP).{{synth|date=March 2017}} The superabsorbent polymers market is anticipated to grow at a CAGR{{huh|date=March 2017}} of 5.5% from 2014 to 2019 to reach a value of $8.78BB globally.<ref name=":0" /> Around 75% of superabsorbent polymers are used in disposable [[diaper]]s and an additional 20% is used for adult [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]] and [[feminine hygiene]] products. [[Polyaspartic acid]], the polymerization product of aspartic acid, is a biodegradable substitute to [[polyacrylate]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Alford DD, Wheeler AP, Pettigrew CA | title = Biodegradation of thermally synthesized polyaspartate | journal = J Environ Polym Degr | volume = 2 | pages = 225–236 | date = 1994 }}</ref> The polyaspartate market comprises a small fraction (est. < 1%) of the total SAP market.

===Additional uses===

In addition to SAP, aspartic acid has applications in the $19B fertilizer industry, where polyaspartate improves water retention and nitrogen uptake;<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Kelling K | title = Crop Responses to Amisorb in the North Central Region | publisher = University of Wisconsin-Madison | date = 2001 }}</ref> the $1.1B (2020) concrete floor coatings market, where polyaspartic is a low VOC, low energy alternative to traditional epoxy resins;<ref>Global concrete floor coatings market will be worth US$1.1 bn by 2020.
