'''Dimenhydrinate''', marketed as '''Dramamine''' and '''Gravol''' among others, is an [[over-the-counter]] medication used to treat [[motion sickness]] and [[nausea]]. Dimenhydrinate is a combination of two drugs: [[diphenhydramine]] and [[8-chlorotheophylline]].

It is most commonly prepared as tablets, although it is also available in liquid form and in [[suppositories]]. 

== Medical uses ==
Dimenhydrinate is primarily used to treat [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], and [[dizziness]] caused by motion sickness.<ref name=MedlinePlus>{{cite web|title=Dimenhydrinate|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a607046.html|website=MedlinePlus|publisher=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=19 July 2014}}</ref> Dimenhydrinate has also been found to aid in the treatment of ear congestion.

Diphenhydramine is the primary constituent of dimenhydrinate and dictates the primary effect. The main difference relative to pure diphenhydramine is a lower [[potency (pharmacology)|potency]] due to being combined with 8-chlorotheophylline. By weight, dimenhydrinate is between 53% to 55.5% diphenhydramine.<ref>{{cite web|title=DIMENHYDRINATE injection, solution|url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=bc71539e-1a33-4709-8a24-c2894e8dbc1c|website=Daily Med|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine|accessdate=19 July 2014}}</ref>

8-Chlorotheophylline, a [[Halogenation|chlorinated]] derivative of [[theophylline]], was added in order to counteract [[Somnolence|drowsiness]]. Theophylline is very closely related to [[caffeine]] and [[theobromine]], mild [[central nervous system]] [[stimulant|stimulants]]. It was thought by scientists{{who|date=July 2014}} that by combining the [[antiemetic]] effects of diphenhydramine with a stimulant, the extreme drowsiness induced by the former could be mitigated somewhat by the latter. The sedation caused by diphenhydramine, however, is substantially stronger than the stimulation caused by 8-chlorotheophylline, so the overall effect is still mostly sedating.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

== Recreational use ==
Dimenhydrinate is recreationally used as a [[deliriant]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.narconon.org/drug-abuse/prescription/motion-sickness-pills.html|title=The Health Risks of Abusing Motion sickness pills|website=Narconon International|access-date=2016-09-13}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Lessenger|first=James E.|date=2008|title=Abuse of Prescription and Over-the-Counter Medications|url=|journal=Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine|volume=21|issue=1|pages=45–54|doi=10.3122/jabfm.2008.01.070071|pmid=18178702|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gardner|first=D.

Many users report a side effect profile consistent with [[tropane alkaloid]] (e.g. [[atropine]]) poisoning as both show antagonism of [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptors]] in both the central and autonomic nervous system, which inhibits various signal transduction pathways.<ref name=":0" /> In the CNS, diphenhydramine readily crosses the [[blood-brain barrier]], exerting effects within the visual and auditory cortex.

Other CNS effects occur within the [[limbic system]] and [[hippocampus]], causing [[confusion]] and temporary [[amnesia]] due to decreased [[acetylcholine]] signaling. Toxicology also manifests in the autonomic nervous system, primarily at the [[neuromuscular junction]], resulting in [[ataxia]] and extrapyramidal side-effects and the feeling of heaviness in the legs, and at sympathetic post-ganglionic junctions, causing urinary retention, pupil dilation, [[tachycardia]], irregular urination, and dry red skin caused by decreased [[exocrine gland]] secretions, and mucous membranes. Considerable overdosage can lead to myocardial infarction (heart attack), serious [[ventricular dysrhythmia]]s, coma and death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.muirwoodteen.com/over-the-counter-drug-abuse/motion-sickness-pills/|title=Are Teens Abusing Motion Sickness Pills? - Muir Wood Adolescent and Family Services|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-13}}</ref> Such a side-effect profile is thought to give [[ethanolamine]]-class antihistamines a relatively low abuse liability. The specific antidote for dimenhydrinate poisoning is [[physostigmine]], usually given by IV in a hospital.

== Veterinary use ==
Dimenhydrinate has successfully been used as an [[antiemetic]] and sedative in housepets.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}
