'''Rolaids''' is an American brand of [[antacid]] produced by [[Chattem]].  It was invented by [[United States|American]] [[chemistry|chemist]] [[Irvine W. Grote]] in the late 1920s, and originated with manufacturing in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] under one of Chattem's forerunner companies, which manufactured the brand for [[Warner-Lambert]]; Warner-Lambert merged with Pfizer in 2000.

In 2006, [[McNeil Laboratories|McNeil Consumer Healthcare]], a subsidiary of [[Johnson & Johnson]], acquired the brand from [[Pfizer]] Consumer Healthcare.  In 2013, McNeil sold the brand to Sanofi, <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2013/01/johnson_johnson_sells_its_trou.html|title=Johnson & Johnson sells its troubled Rolaids brand to Sanofi|last=Friedman|first=Alexi|date=8 January 2013|work=[[The Star-Ledger]]|accessdate=9 September 2013}}</ref> following a two-year period where the brand was pulled off the market due to [[product recall]]s resulting from [[quality control]] and manufacturing issues that also left former fellow antacid brand [[Pepcid AC]]'s "chewables" product and other fellow McNeil products like some varieties of [[Tylenol (brand)|Tylenol]] off store shelves for the same period.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2013/jan/09/rolaids-next-on-chattems-plate/|title=Rolaids next on Chattanooga-based Chattem's plate|last=Pare|first=Mike|date=9 January 2013|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|accessdate=9 September 2013}}</ref> Rolaids returned to the market at the beginning of September 2013 under Chattem ownership with new packaging, [[trade dress]], and a new liquid variety.

Rolaids tablets come in many different flavors, including original peppermint, cherry, freshmint, fruit, tropical, punch, cool mint, berry, and apple.

==2010 recall==
McNeil Consumer Healthcare voluntarily recalled Rolaids products in the Americas, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Fiji on January 15, 2010, in consultation with the FDA. The company initiated the recall following an investigation of consumer reports of an unusual moldy, musty, or mildewlike odor that, in a small number of cases, was associated with temporary and nonserious gastrointestinal events. These events included nausea, stomach pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. At that time, the Rolaids website carried the following statement regarding product availability: "You may have noticed that ROLAIDS® products are not available at your local retailers. We are changing some of our manufacturing facilities where our products are made, a process that will take time to complete. We apologize for the inconvenience this may be causing you. Your health and comfort are important to us, and we assure you we are working hard to get ROLAIDS® product back on store shelves."<ref>http://www.rolaids.com/product-suply</ref>

Another recall was issued around December 9, 2010, as a result of foreign objects that contained metal and wood particles.<ref name=recall>{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.rolaids.com/generic.jhtml?id=/rolaids/include/faq_decrecall.inc#3_july|date=2010-12-09|accessdate=2010-12-22}}</ref> The foreign materials were caused by a third-party manufacturer during the production process.<ref name=recall/> Several people complained when they took the product; they also had vomiting, strange taste, and tooth and gum injury.<ref name=recall/> After this recall, beyond the small "candy aisle" rolls and chewable lines, the Rolaids line of products was drastically reduced and disappeared from most American retailers until Chattem returned the product to the market in the fall of 2013.

==Advertising==
Rolaids' best-known commercial from the 1970s featured the famous tag line:

:''"How do you spell relief?"''
:''"R-O-L-A-I-D-S"''

In connection with the famous slogan, Rolaids sponsored the [[Major League Baseball]] award for top [[relief pitcher]]s called the [[Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award]]. The award was given yearly from 1976 through 2012.

==Rolaids softchews==
[[Pfizer]] released a new version of Rolaids on April 6, 2006,<ref>http://www.pfizerch.com/inthenews.aspx  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115183132/http://www.pfizerch.com/inthenews.aspx |date=November 15, 2006 }}</ref> branded ''Extra Strength Rolaids Plus Gas Relief Softchews''. The product was produced as an alternative for people averse to the chalky consistency of regular Rolaids. They were widely advertised in multiple media formats.

Rolaids Softchews were originally developed and test marketed in Oklahoma City under the brand name Remegel by Warner Lambert in 1984.
