'''Nabumetone''' is a [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] (NSAID).<ref name="pmid17694703">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gonzalo-Garijo MA, Cordobés-Duran C, Lamilla-Yerga AM, Moreno-Gastón I |title=Severe immediate reaction to nabumetone |journal=Journal of Investigational Allergology and Clinical Immunology |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=274–6 |year=2007 |pmid=17694703 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Nabumetone has been developed by [[Beecham (pharmaceutical company)|Beecham]]. It is available under numerous brand names, such as '''Relafen''', '''Relifex''', and '''Gambaran'''.

Nabumetone is a nonacidic NSAID that is rapidly metabolized in the liver to a major active metabolite, 6-methoxy-2-naphthyl acetic acid. As found with previous NSAIDs, nabumetone's active metabolite inhibits the [[cyclooxygenase]] enzyme and preferentially blocks [[COX-2]] activity (which is indirectly responsible for the production of inflammation and pain during arthritis). The active metabolite of nabumetone is felt to be the compound primarily responsible for therapeutic effect. Comparatively, the parent drug is a poor inhibitor of COX-2 byproducts, particularly [[prostaglandins]]. It may be less [[Nephrotoxicity|nephrotoxic]] than [[indomethacin]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Olsen | first1 = N V | last2 = Jensen | first2 = N G | last3 = Hansen | first3 = J M | last4 = Christensen | first4 = N J | last5 = Fogh-Andersen | first5 = N | last6 = Kanstrup | first6 = I L | title =  Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and renal response to exercise: a comparison of indomethacin and nabumetone| doi = 10.1042/cs0970457 | journal = Clin Sci. | year = 1999 | volume = 97| pages = 457–465 }}</ref>

Nabumetone has little effect on renal [[prostaglandin]] secretion and less of an association with [[heart failure]] than other traditional drugs of the class.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Donnan | first1 = P T | year = 2000 | title =  098.

==Medical uses==
Similar in action to other NSAIDs, Nabumetone is used to treat pain and inflammation.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Side effects==
It has been shown to have a slightly lower risk of gastrointestinal side effects than most other non-selective NSAIDs since it is a non-acidic prodrug which is then metabolized to its active 6MNA (6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid) form.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}
