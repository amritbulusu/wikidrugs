'''25I-NBOMe''' ('''2C-I-NBOMe''', '''Cimbi-5''', also shortened to "'''25I'''") is a [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] [[hallucinogen]] that is used in biochemistry research for mapping the brains usage of the [[5-HT2A receptor|type 2A]] [[serotonin]] [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] and later also has been used for recreational purpose. It is derivative of the [[substituted phenethylamine]] [[2C-I]] and is the most well-known member of the [[25-NB family]]. It was discovered in 2003 by chemist Ralf Heim at the [[Free University of Berlin]], who published his findings in his PhD dissertation.<ref name=ralfheim>{{cite web |author=Ralf Heim |title=Synthese und Pharmakologie potenter 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>-Rezeptoragonisten mit N-2-Methoxybenzyl-Partialstruktur.

==Recreational use==
Although 25I-NBOMe was discovered in 2003, it did not emerge as a common recreational drug until 2010, when it was first sold by vendors specialising in the supply of [[research chemicals]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} In a slang context, the name of the compound is often shortened to "25I" or is called "N-Bomb".<ref name="NY Daily news"/> According to a 2014 survey, 25I-NBOMe is the most frequently used of the NBOMe series.<ref name="Lawn 2014">{{cite journal | url=http://jop.sagepub.com/content/28/8/780 | title=The NBOMe hallucinogenic drug series: Patterns of use, characteristics of users and self-reported effects in a large international sample | date=August 2014 | last=Lawn | first=Will | author2=Monica Barrat |author3=Martin Wiliams |author4=Abi Horne |author5=Adam Winstock | journal=Journal of Psychopharmocology | volume=28 | issue=8 | pages=780–788 | doi=10.1177/0269881114523866 | pmid=24569095}}</ref> Case reports of 25I-NBOMe intoxication, with and without analytic confirmation of the drug in the body, are increasing in the medical literature.<ref name="Clinical Toxicology Cases" />

25I-NBOMe is widely rumored to be orally inactive; however, oral efficacy has not been disproven and apparent overdoses have occurred via oral administration. Common routes of administration include [[Sublingual administration|sublingual]], [[buccal administration|buccal]], and nasal/intranasal.<ref name="Lawn 2014" /> For sublingual and buccal administration, 25I-NBOMe is often applied to sheets of [[Blotting paper#Drugs|blotter paper]] of which small portions (''tabs'') are held in the mouth to allow absorption through the oral mucosa.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Poklis|first1=Justin L.|last2=Raso|first2=Stephen A.|last3=Alford|first3=Kylie N.|last4=Poklis|first4=Alphonse|last5=Peace|first5=Michelle R.|title=Analysis of 25I-NBOMe, 25B-NBOMe, 25C-NBOMe and Other Dimethoxyphenyl-N-[(2-Methoxyphenyl) Methyl] Ethanamine Derivatives on Blotter Paper|journal=Journal of Analytical Toxicology|date=1 October 2015|volume=39|issue=8|pages=617–623|doi=10.1093/jat/bkv073|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/jat/bkv073|issn=0146-4760}}</ref><ref name="ACMD Report" /> There are reports of intravenous injection of 25I-NBOMe solution and smoking the drug in powdered form.<ref name="British Case Reports">{{cite journal | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/15563650.2013.802795 | title=Severe clinical toxicity associated with analytically confirmed recreational use of 25I–NBOMe: case series | date=July 2013 | last=Hill | first=Simon L. | author2=Tom Doris |author3=Shiv Gurung |author4=Stephen Katebe |author5=Alexander Lomas |author6=Mick Dunn |author7=Peter Blain |author8=Simon H.

Due to its potency and much lower cost than so-called classical or traditional psychedelics, 25I-NBOMe blotters are sometimes misrepresented as, or mistaken for [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] blotters.<ref name="Erowid Main"/> It is dangerous to attempt to differentiate the two using [[human senses|sensory]] techniques (i.e. taste) but [[pill testing|reagent testing]] (in particular [[ehrlich's reagent]]) can easily differentiate [[ergoline]]s from 25I-NBOMe via colour change.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://bunkpolice.com/ehrlichs-reagent-kit/ | title=Reagent Kit Ehrlich | publisher=Bunk Police}}</ref> Small quantities of 25I-NBOMe can provide a large numbers of doses. Vendors may import 25I-NBOMe in bulk and resell individual doses for considerable profit.<ref name="ACMD Report" />

==Dosage==
25I-NBOMe is potent, being active in sub-milligram doses. A common dose of the hydrochloride salt is 600–1,200 [[microgram|µg]]. The UK Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs states that a common dose is between 50 and 100&nbsp;µg,<ref name="ACMD Report">{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/temporary-class-drug-order-report-on-benzofury-and-nbome-compounds | title=Temporary class drug order on benzofury and NBOMe compounds | publisher=Gov.Uk | work=Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs | date=4 June 2013 | last=Iversen | first=Les}}</ref> although other sources indicate that these figures are incorrect; [[Erowid]] tentatively suggests that the threshold dosage for humans is 50–250&nbsp;µg, with a light dose between 200–600&nbsp;µg, a common dose at 500–800&nbsp;µg, and a strong dose at 700–1500&nbsp;µg.<ref name="erowid-dose">{{Cite web |url=https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/2ci_nbome/2ci_nbome_dose.shtml |title=2C-I-NBOMe (25I) Dose |publisher=Erowid}}</ref> At this level of potency, it is not possible to accurately measure a single dose of 25I-NBOMe powder without an analytical balance, and attempting to do so may put the user at significant risk of overdose.<ref name="ACMD Report" />

==Effects==
25I-NBOMe effects usually last 6–10 hours if taken sublingually or buccally.<ref name="erowid effects" /> When it is insufflated, effects usually last 4–6 hours.<ref name= "erowid effects">{{Cite web |url=https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/2ci_nbome/2ci_nbome_effects.shtml |title=2C-I-NBOMe (25I) Effects |publisher=Erowid}}</ref> However, effects can last significantly longer depending on dosage; durations longer than 12 hours have been reported.

25I-NBOMe can also be vaporized and inhaled, this may cause significantly quicker effects and shorter duration as is expected from that route of administration. However, this route of administration is not recommended, unless using precise liquid measurement, due to the difficulties of measuring and handling substances active in the microgram range.

25I-NBOMe has similar effects to LSD, though users report more negative effects while under the influence and more risk of harm following use as compared to other classic psychedelics.<ref name="Lawn 2014" />

Case reports of seven British males who presented to an emergency room following analytically confirmed 25I-NBOMe intoxication suggest the following potential adverse effects: "tachycardia (n = 7), hypertension (4), agitation (6), aggression, visual and auditory hallucinations (6), seizures (3), hyperpyrexia (3), clonus (2), elevated white cell count (2), elevated creatine kinase (7), metabolic acidosis (3), and acute kidney injury (1)."<ref name="British Case Reports" />

==Toxicity==
Recreational use of 25I-NBOMe carries significant risk of both pharmacological and behavioral toxicity.<ref name="Clinical Toxicology Cases" /><ref name="British Case Reports" /> 25I-NBOMe is a relatively new substance, and little is known about its pharmacological risks or its interaction with other substances. The {{LD50}} has not yet been determined.<ref name="Erowid fatalities">{{cite web|title=Fatalities / Deaths|url=https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/2ci_nbome/2ci_nbome_death.shtml|publisher=Erowid}}</ref> It is a highly potent serotonin agonist and, due to its psychedelic effects and ambiguous legal status, a [[designer drug]] with reports of recreational use beginning in 2010. Reports of deaths and significant injuries have been attributed to the use of 25I-NBOMe, prompting some governments to control its possession, production, and sale. The harm-reduction website [[Erowid]] states that 25I-NBOMe is extremely potent and should not be snorted as this method of administration "appears to have led to several deaths in the past year."<ref name="Erowid Main">{{cite web|title=25I-NBOMe|url=https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/2ci_nbome/2ci_nbome.shtml|publisher=Erowid}}</ref> Several non-fatal overdoses requiring prolonged hospitalization have also been reported.<ref name="ACMD Report" /><ref name="Clinical Toxicology Cases" /><ref name="British Case Reports" />

25I-NBOMe has been linked to a major case on January 20, 2016 in [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Ireland|Republic of Ireland]], which left six teenagers hospitalised, one of whom later died.

25I-NBOMe presumably exhibits functional selectivity at the 5HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor similar to other [[phenethylamine]] hallucinogens, activating the [[Phospholipase A2]] signal cascade,<ref>{{cite journal | title=Functional Selectivity of Hallucinogenic Phenethylamine and Phenylisopropylamine Derivatives at Human 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)<sub>2A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> Receptors | date=June 2007 | display-authors=etal | journal=Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume=321 | pages=1054–1061 | doi=10.1124/jpet.106.117507 | first1=PR | last1=Moya | url=http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/321/3/1054.long | last2=Berg | first2=KA | last3=Gutiérrez-Hernandez | first3=MA | issue=3 | pmid=17337633}}</ref> which is responsible for the release of [[Thromboxane A2]], triggering blood platelet aggregation. Excessive concentrations of TXA2 could lead to [[thrombosis]], which when coupled with 25I-NBOMe's vasoconstrictive effect, is a major risk factor for [[cardiac ischemia]], a dangerous condition the symptoms of which are present in several toxicological reports.<ref name="Erowid fatalities" />

==Chemistry==
Like other 2C-''X''-NBOMe molecules, 25I-NBOMe is a derivative of the [[2C (psychedelics)|2C]] family of phenethylamines described by [[Alexander Shulgin]] in his book [[PiHKAL]].<ref name="ACMD Report" /><ref name="Clinical Toxicology Cases">{{cite journal | title=A case of 25I-NBOMe (25-I) intoxication: a new potent 5-HT2A agonist designer drug | date=March 2013 | last=Rose | first=S.

This substitution significantly increases the potency of the molecule.<ref name="ACMD Report" />

===Synthesis===
25I-NBOMe can be synthesised from 2C-I and 2-methoxybenzaldehyde, via reductive [[alkylation]]. It can be done stepwise by first making the [[imine]] and then [[Redox|reducing]] the formed imine with [[sodium borohydride]], or by direct reaction with [[sodium triacetoxyborohydride]].<ref name=ralfheim />
