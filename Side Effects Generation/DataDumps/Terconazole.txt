'''Terconazole''' is an [[antifungal]] drug used to treat [[vaginal yeast infection]]. It comes as a lotion or a suppository and disrupts the biosynthesis of fats in a yeast cell. It has a relatively broad spectrum compared to azole compounds but not triazole compounds. Testing shows that it is a suitable compound for prophylaxis for those that suffer from chronic vulvovaginal candidiasis.

==Drug Class==
Terconazole is a triazole [[ketal]] with broad-spectrum antifungal/antimycotic tendencies.

==History==
In 1940, the first commercial antifungal drug was available on the market. Before this, antifungal treatments were rare and expensive. This treatment was called [[amphotericin B]]. It was effective in its function but was very toxic and only used for serious infections. The drug was infused into the bloodstream and could cause kidney damage and other side effects. The first azole compounds were administered to humans under strict care. These compounds were imidazoles, a molecule containing two non-adjacent nitrogen atoms in a 5 membered ring. These were synthesized in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The first oral antimycotic imidazole called [[ketoconazole]] was available on the market in 1981. Triazole based drugs came shortly after and quickly gained popularity due to its broader spectrum of antifungal activity and less toxicity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Maertens|first1=J.

==Indications==
Terconazole is approved to treat vulvovaginal candidiasis (vaginal thrush).

==Chemical Structure, Reactivity, Synthesis==
Terconazole synthesis synologous with ketoconazole except for the fact that triazole and not imidazole heterocyclic ring is used, and that isopropyl group instead of acetamide.

Terconazole has the chemical formula C<sub>26</sub>H<sub>31</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>N<sub>5</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The chemical name for terconazole is 1-<nowiki/>{[(2''S'',4''S'')-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-<nowiki/>{[''p''-(4-isopropyl-1-piperazinyl)phenoxy]methyl}-1,3-dioxolan-2-yl]methyl}-1''H''-1,2,4-triazole. Terconazole has a melting point of 126.3&nbsp;°C (259.34&nbsp;°F). The molecular weight of terconazole is 532.462 g/mol. Terconazole is synthesized using two chemical compounds: ''cis''-[2(bromomethyl)-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl] methyl benzoate and the sodium salt of triazole, created by mixing [[triazole]] with [[sodium hydride]]. These are put in a solution and catalyzed using [[dimethyl sulfate]] at 1300&nbsp;°C (2372&nbsp;°F) to give many different types of triazole derivatives.<ref name="Cauwenbergh" /> These are purified using alcohol and [[chromatography]]. Terconazole is non-reactive except when exposed to strong oxidizing agents or strong bases due to the nitrogen attached to the triazole ring. It has been found to be photosensitive.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fromtling|first1=RA|title=Overview of Medically Important Antifungal Azole Derivatives|journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews|date=April 1988|volume=1|issue=2|pages=187–217|pmid=3069196|pmc=358042}}</ref>

==Available Forms==
Terconazole is a white, odourless powder. It can be purchased commercially in the following forms:
* Terconazole 0.4% cream 5 g applied intravaginally once a day for 7 days;
* Terconazole 0.8% cream 5 g applied intravaginally once a day for 3 days;
* Terconazole 80&nbsp;mg vaginal suppository used once daily for 3 days.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Mosby|editor1-last=White|editor1-first=K|editor2-last=Watrous|editor2-first=J|title=Mosby's Drug Reference for Health Professions|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier|location=3251 Riverport Lane, St. Louis, Missouri, USA|isbn=978-0-323-09574-7|pages=1558–1559|edition=3rd|chapter=Terconazole}}</ref>

==Mechanism of Action==
Terconazole binds to the heme iron component on the [[cytochrome P450]] enzyme [[lanosterol]] of fungi, also known as [[CYP3A4]]. The gene ERG11 controls lanosterol creation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Yoshida|first1=Y|title=Cytochrome P450 of Fungi: Primary Target for Azole Antifungal Agents|journal=Current Topics in Medical Mycology|pages=388–418|pmid=3288361|volume=2}}</ref> Lanosterol is found within the yeast plasma membrane. It is a class of methylsterol. Within a normal yeast cell, lanosterol is demethylated using 14α-demethylation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Isaacson|first1=D. M.|last2=Tolman|first2=E. L.|last3=Tobia|first3=A. J.|last4=Rosenthale|first4=M. E.|last5=McGuire|first5=J. L.|last6=Bossche|first6=H. Vanden|last7=Janssen|first7=P. A. J.|title=Selective Inhibition of 14α-Desmethyl Sterol Synthesis in Candida albicans by Terconazole, a New Triazole Antimycotic|journal=Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy|date=1988|volume=21|issue=3|pages=333–343|doi=10.1093/jac/21.3.333}}</ref> This process creates [[zymosterol]]: a major constituent in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway for the creation of cell membrane constituents in yeast. This structure provides the membrane with fluidity.<ref>{{cite web|title=C-4 Methylsterol Oxidase Activity|url=http://www.yeastgenome.org/go/GO:0000254/overview|website=Saccharomyces Genome Database|publisher=Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305|accessdate=10 July 2015}}</ref> This occurs by transforming lanosterol into 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-β-ol. This stops respiration by prohibiting reduction of [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NADH]] to NAD. This stops biosynthesis of cell membrane products as well as transport and catabolism. Eventually, membrane fluidity and activity of membrane bound enzymes become depleted. It has also been shown to inhibit morphologic change of yeast as well as cell adherence and is directly toxic to yeast. Terconazole targets fungi specifically since humans do not use lanosterol in this pathway. This process does not affect all fungi such as ''[[Pneumocystis jirovecii]]'', which lacks lanosterol.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sobel|first1=Jack D.|title=Mini Review. Candida Vaginitis|journal=Infectious Diseases in Clinical Practice|date=1994|volume=3|issue=5|pages=334–9|doi=10.1097/00019048-199409000-00002}}</ref>

==Metabolism==
Absorption of terconazole is 5–8% in patients that have had a hysterectomy and 12–16% in other patients. In those that administered 0.8% terconazole, plasma concentrations of the drug remained quite low with the peak plasma concentration being 0.006 mcg at 6.6 hours. Those metabolism rates show similar results in pregnant vulvovaginal candidiasis, non-pregnant vulvovaginal candidiasis and healthy women. The half-life of terconazole in blood is recorded to be around 6.9 hours over a range of 4–11.3 hours). Radioactivity of plasma terconazole is low compared to terconazole at 0.6%. Excretion of radioactivity is via two routes, renal (32–53%) and fecal (47–52%). Metabolism is extensive and is highly protein bound (94.9%) with the degree of binding being independent of drug concentration.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sheehan|first1=DJ|last2=Hitchcock|first2=CA|last3=Sibley|first3=CM|title=Current and Emerging Azole Antifungal Agents|journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews|date=January 1999|volume=12|issue=1|pages=40–79|pmid=9880474|pmc=88906}}</ref>

==Efficacy==
In a review of 19 studies, it was shown that short-term rates for intravaginally administered azole treatments show mycological cure (no presence of organism) in 80% of cases in a short term follow-up and 66% over long term follow-up.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nurbhai|first1=M|last2=Grimshaw|first2=J|last3=Watson|first3=M|last4=Bond|first4=C|last5=Mollison|first5=J|last6=Ludbrook|first6=A|title=Oral Versus Intra-vaginal Imidazole and Triazole Anti-fungal Treatment of Uncomplicated Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (Thrush)|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=17 October 2007|issue=4|pages=CD002845|pmid=17943774|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002845.pub2}}</ref> In a double-blind study by Slavin in 1992, terconazole showed a 75% mycological cure over a short-term period (7–14 days) and 100% mycological cure over a long-term period (28–34 days).
