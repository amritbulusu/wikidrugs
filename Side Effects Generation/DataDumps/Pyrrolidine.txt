'''Pyrrolidine''', also known as '''tetrahydropyrrole''', is an [[organic compound]] with the molecular formula (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>NH.  It is a cyclic secondary [[amine]], also classified as a saturated [[heterocycle]].  It is a colourless liquid that is miscible with water and most organic solvents. It has a characteristic odor that has been described as "ammoniacal, fishy, shellfish-like".<ref>[http://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/data/rw1009391.html Pyrrolidine], The Good Scents Company</ref> In addition to pyrrolidine itself, many substituted pyrrolidines are known.

==Synthesis and occurrence==
Pyrrolidine is produced by treatment of 1,4-butanediol with ammonia over an oxide catalyst.<ref name=Ullmann>Karsten Eller, Erhard Henkes, Roland Rossbacher, Hartmut Höke "Amines, Aliphatic" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a02_001}}</ref>

Many modifications of pyrrolidine are found in natural and synthetic chemistry. The pyrrolidine ring structure is present in numerous natural [[alkaloid]]s such as [[nicotine]] and [[hygrine]]. It is found in many drugs such as [[procyclidine]] and [[bepridil]]. It also forms the basis for the [[racetam]] compounds (e.g. [[piracetam]], [[aniracetam]]). The [[amino acid]]s [[proline]] and [[hydroxyproline]] are, in a structural sense, derivatives of pyrrolidine.

==Reactions==
Pyrrolidine is a base.  Its basicity is typical of other dialkyl amines.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Correlation of the Base Strengths of Amines|author=H. K. Hall, Jr.|journal=J. Am. Chem. Soc.|year=1957|volume=79|page=5441|doi=10.1021/ja01577a030}}</ref>  Relative to many secondary amines, pyrrolidine is distinctive because of its compactness, a consequence of its cyclic structure.

Pyrrolidine is used as a building block in the synthesis of more complex organic compounds.  It is used to activate [[ketone]]s and [[aldehyde]]s toward nucleophilic addition by formation of [[enamine]]s:<ref>{{OrgSynth|author=[[R. B. Woodward]], I. J. Pachter, and M. L.
