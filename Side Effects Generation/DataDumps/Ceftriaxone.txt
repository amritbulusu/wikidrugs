In combination with doxycycline or azithromycin, ceftriaxone is recommended by the [[United States Centers for Disease Control]] for the treatment of gonorrhea. By itself, it is not recommended due to the potential for resistance development.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6131a3.htm|title = Update to CDC's Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2010: Oral Cephalosporins No Longer a Recommended Treatment for Gonococcal Infections|work = |accessdate = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151006070610/http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6131a3.htm|archivedate = 2015-10-06|df = }}</ref>

=== Spectrum of activity ===
Like other third-generation cephalosporins, ceftriaxone is active against ''[[Citrobacter]]'' spp., ''[[Serratia marcescens]]'', and beta-lactamase-producing strains of ''[[Haemophilus]]'' and ''[[Neisseria]]''.<ref name=":12" /> However, unlike [[ceftazidime]] and [[cefoperazone]], ceftriaxone does not have useful activity against ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''.<ref name=":12" /> It is generally not active against ''Enterobacter'' species, and its use should be avoided in the treatment of ''Enterobacter'' infections, even if the isolate appears susceptible, because of the emergence of resistance.<ref name=":12" /> Some organisms, such as ''Citrobacter,  Providencia'', and ''Serratia'', have the ability to become resistant through the development of cephalosporinases (these enzymes hydrolyze cephalosporins and render them inactive).<ref name=":12" />

=== Available forms ===
Ceftriaxone is available for administration via the intramuscular or the intravenous routes.<ref name=":232"/> Diluents containing calcium should not be used to reconstitute ceftriaxone and it must not be administered in intravenous lines containing other calcium-containing solutions, as a ceftriaxone-calcium precipitate could form.<ref name=":232"/>

=== Specific populations ===

====Pregnancy====

Ceftriaxone is pregnancy category B.<ref name=":232"/> It has not been observed to cause birth defects in animal studies, but a lack of well-controlled studies done in pregnant women exists.<ref name=":232"/>

====Breastfeeding====

Low concentrations of ceftriaxone are excreted in breast milk that are "not expected to cause adverse effects in breastfed infants."<ref>{{Cite web|title = TOXNET|url = http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search2/r?dbs+lactmed:@term+@DOCNO+57|website = toxnet.nlm.nih.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-04|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170908213423/https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search2/r?dbs+lactmed%253A%2540term+%2540DOCNO+57|archivedate = 2017-09-08|df = }}</ref> The manufacturer recommends that caution be exercised when administering ceftriaxone to women who breastfeed.<ref name=":232"/>

==== Newborns ====
Hyperbilirubinemic neonates are contraindicated for the use of ceftriaxone.<ref name=":232"/> It can compete with [[bilirubin]] and displace it from binding to [[Human serum albumin|albumin]], increasing the risk of bilirubin [[encephalopathy]].<ref name=":232"/>

==== Elderly ====
According to the package insert, clinical studies did not 
show differences in efficacy and safety of ceftriaxone in geriatrics compared to younger patients but "greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."<ref name=":232"/>

== Adverse effects ==

Although generally well tolerated, the most common adverse reactions associated with ceftriaxone are changes in white blood cell counts, local reactions at site of administration, rash, and diarrhea.<ref name=":02" />

Incidence of adverse effects greater than 1%:
* [[Eosinophilia]] (6%)
* [[Thrombocytosis]] (5.1%)
* Elevations in liver enzymes (3.1–3.3%)
* Diarrhea (2.7%) 
* [[Leukopenia]] (2.1%)
* Elevation in [[Blood urea nitrogen|BUN]] (1.2%) 
* Local reactions—pain, tenderness, irritation (1%)
* Rash (1.7%)<ref name=":02" />
Some less frequently reported adverse events (incidence < 1%) include [[phlebitis]], itchiness, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, elevations of [[bilirubin]], elevations in [[creatinine]], headache and dizziness.<ref name=":02" />

Ceftriaxone may precipitate in bile, causing [[biliary sludge]], [[biliary pseudolithiasis]], and [[gallstone]]s, especially in children. [[Hypoprothrombinemia|Hypoprothrombinaemia]] and bleeding are specific side effects.

==Mechanism of action==

Ceftriaxone is a third-generation antibiotic from the [[cephalosporin]] family of antibiotics.<ref name=":12"/>  It is within <math>\beta</math>-lactam family of antibiotics. Ceftriaxone selectively and irreversibly inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to transpeptidases, also called transamidases, which are [[Penicillin binding proteins|penicillin-binding proteins]] (PBPs) that catalyze the cross-linking of the [[peptidoglycan]] polymers forming the bacterial cell wall.<ref name=":032">{{Cite book|title = Foye's Principles of Medicinal Chemistry|publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|year = 2013|isbn = 9781609133450|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 1093–1094, 1099–1100|editor-last = Lemke|editor-first = Thomas L.|editor-last2 = Williams|editor-first2 = David A.|edition = Seventh}}</ref> The peptidoglycan cell wall is made up of pentapeptide units attached to a polysaccharide backbone with alternating units of N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Formation of the glycan chains in the synthesis of bacterial peptidoglycan|journal = Glycobiology|date = 2001-03-01|issn = 0959-6658|pmid = 11320055|pages = 25R–36R|volume = 11|issue = 3|first = J.|last = van Heijenoort|doi=10.1093/glycob/11.3.25r}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|title = Bacterial Cell Wall Synthesis: New Insights from Localization Studies|url = http://mmbr.asm.org/content/69/4/585|journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews|date = 2005-12-01|issn = 1092-2172|pmc = 1306805|pmid = 16339737|pages = 585–607|volume = 69|issue = 4|doi = 10.1128/MMBR.69.4.585-607.2005|first = Dirk-Jan|last = Scheffers|first2 = Mariana G.|last2 = Pinho|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160607070648/http://mmbr.asm.org/content/69/4/585|archivedate = 2016-06-07|df = }}</ref> PBPs act on a terminal D-alanyl-D-alanine moiety on a pentapeptide unit and catalyze the formation of a peptide bond between the penultimate D-alanine and a glycine unit on an adjacent peptidoglycan strand, releasing the terminal D-alanine unit in the process.<ref name=":032"/><ref name=":3" /> The structure of ceftriaxone mimics the D-alanyl-D-alanine moiety, and the PBP attacks the beta-lactam ring in ceftriaxone as if it were its normal D-alanyl-D-alanine substrate.<ref name=":032"/> The [[peptidoglycan]] cross-linking activity of PBPs is a construction and repair mechanism that normally helps to maintain bacterial cell wall integrity, so the inhibition of PBPs leads to damage and destruction of the cell wall and eventually to cell lysis.<ref name=":032"/>

Ceftriaxone is commercially available as a white to yellowish-orange crystalline powder for reconstitution.<ref name=":232"/> Reconstituted ceftriaxone injection solutions are light yellow- to amber-colored depending on how long the solution had been reconstituted, the concentration of ceftriaxone in the solution, and the diluent used.<ref name=":232"/> To reduce pain with intramuscular injections, ceftriaxone may be reconstituted with [[lidocaine]].<ref>{{cite journal |title = Lidocaine as a diluent for ceftriaxone in the treatment of gonorrhea.

The ''syn''-configuration of the [[methoxy]][[oxime]] moiety confers resistance to [[Beta lactamase|beta-lactamase]] enzymes produced by many [[Gram-negative bacteria]].<ref name=":032"/> The stability of this configuration results in increased activity of ceftriaxone against otherwise resistant Gram-negative bacteria.<ref name=":032" /> In place of the easily [[Hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] [[acetyl]] group of cefotaxime, ceftriaxone has a metabolically stable thiotriazinedione moiety.<ref name=":032" />
