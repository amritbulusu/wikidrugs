'''Isoleucine''' (abbreviated as '''Ile''' or '''I''') encoded by the codons ATT, ATC, ATA<ref>Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, University of Denmark 
http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/courses/27619/codon.html</ref> is an [[Amino acid|α-amino acid]] that is used in the [[biosynthesis]] of [[protein]]s. It contains an [[Amine|α-amino group]] (which is in the protonated −NH{{su|b=3|p=+}} form under biological conditions), an [[Carboxylic acid|α-carboxylic acid group]] (which is in the deprotonated −COO{{sup|−}} form under biological conditions), and a [[hydrocarbon]] side chain, classifying it as a non-polar, uncharged (at physiological pH), [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] amino acid. It is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it, and must be ingested in our diet. Isoleucine is synthesized from [[Pyruvic acid|pyruvate]] employing leucine biosynthesis enzymes in other organisms such as bacteria.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://jb.oxfordjournals.org/content/82/1/95.long|title = Pathway for isoleucine formation form pyruvate by leucine biosynthetic enzymes in leucine-accumulating isoleucine revertants of Serratia marcescens.|last = Kisumi|first = M|date = Jul 1977|journal = J.

Inability to break down isoleucine, along with other amino acids, is associated with the disease called [[Maple syrup urine disease|Maple Syrup Urine Disease]], which results in discoloration and a sweet smell in the patient's urine, which is where the name comes from. However, in severe cases, MSUD can lead to damage to the brain cells and ultimately death.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) |url=http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/disorders/singlegene/msud/ |website=learn.genetics.utah.edu |accessdate=2015-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210215033/http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/disorders/singlegene/msud/ |archivedate=2015-12-10 |df= }}</ref>

== Metabolism ==

=== Biosynthesis ===
As an essential nutrient, it is not synthesized in the body, hence it must be ingested, usually as a component of proteins.  In plants and microorganisms, it is synthesized via several steps, starting from [[pyruvic acid]] and [[alpha-ketoglutarate]].  Enzymes involved in this biosynthesis include:<ref>Nelson, D. L.; Cox, M. M. "Lehninger, Principles of Biochemistry" 3rd Ed. Worth Publishing: New York, 2000. {{ISBN|1-57259-153-6}}.</ref>
# [[Acetolactate synthase]] (also known as acetohydroxy acid synthase)
# [[Acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase]]
# [[Dihydroxyacid dehydratase]]
# [[Valine-3-methyl-2-oxovalerate transaminase|Valine aminotransferase]]

=== Catabolism ===

Isoleucine is both a [[glucogenic]] and a [[ketogenic]] amino acid. After transamination with [[alpha-ketoglutarate]] the carbon skeleton can be converted into either [[succinyl CoA]], and fed into the [[TCA cycle]] for oxidation or converted into [[oxaloacetate]] for gluconeogenesis (hence glucogenic). It can also be converted into [[acetyl CoA]] and fed into the TCA cycle by condensing with oxaloacetate to form [[citrate]]. In mammals Acetyl CoA cannot be converted back to carbohydrate but can be used in the synthesis of [[ketone bodies]] or [[fatty acid]]s, hence ketogenic.

[[Biotin]], sometimes referred to as [[vitamin B7]] or [[vitamin H]], is an absolute requirement for the full catabolism of isoleucine (as well as [[leucine]]). Without adequate biotin, the human body will be unable to fully break down isoleucine and leucine molecules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metametrix.com/learning-center/case-studies/2004/biotin-detoxification-needs-in-cognitively-delayed-adult |title=Biotin & Detoxification Needs in Cognitively Delayed Adult - Metametrix Learning Center |publisher=Metametrix.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18}}</ref>

==Requirements==
The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the U.S. Institute of Medicine set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for [[essential amino acid]]s in 2002. For isoleucine, for adults 19 years and older, 19 mg/kg body weight/day.<ref name="DRItext">{{cite book | last1 = [[Institute of Medicine]] | title = Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrates, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids | chapter = Protein and Amino Acids | publisher = The National Academies Press | year = 2002 | location = Washington, DC | pages = 589–768 | url = https://www.nap.edu/read/10490/chapter/12}}</ref>

== Nutritional sources ==
Even though this amino acid is not produced in animals, it is stored in high quantities. Foods that have high amounts of isoleucine include eggs, soy protein, seaweed, turkey, chicken, lamb, cheese, and fish.<ref name="List of Foods high in Isoleucine">[http://www.nutritiondata.com/foods-000081000000000000000.html], List is in order of highest to lowest of per 200 Calorie serving of the food, not volume or weight.</ref>
