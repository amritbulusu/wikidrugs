Genentech's corporate headquarters are in [[South San Francisco, California]], with additional manufacturing facilities in [[Vacaville, California]]; [[Oceanside, California]]; and [[Hillsboro, Oregon]].

In December 2006, Genentech sold its [[O Porriño|Porriño]], [[Spain]] facility to [[Lonza Group|Lonza]] and acquired an exclusive right to purchase Lonza's mammalian cell culture manufacturing facility under construction in [[Singapore]]. In June 2007, Genentech began the construction and development of an ''E. coli'' manufacturing facility, also in Singapore, for the worldwide production of [[Lucentis]] ([[ranibizumab]] injection) bulk drug substance.

Genentech Inc Political Action Committee is a U.S. Federal [[Political Action Committee]] (PAC), created to "aggregate contributions from members or employees and their families to donate to candidates for federal office."<ref name="bloomberg">{{citation |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/profiles/companies/0576742D:US-genentech-inc-pac |publisher=Bloomberg Business |date=nd |accessdate=17 July 2015 |title=Genentech Inc Political Action Committee}}</ref>

==Controversy==

===Disputes===
In November 1999, Genentech agreed to pay the [[University of California, San Francisco]] $200 million to settle a nine-year-old patent dispute. In 1990, UCSF sued Genentech for $400 million in compensation for alleged theft of technology developed at the university and covered by a 1982 patent. Genentech claimed that they developed [[Protropin]] (recombinant [[somatotropin]]/human growth hormone), independently of UCSF. A jury ruled that the university's patent was valid in July 1999, but wasn't able to decide whether Protropin was based upon UCSF research or not. Protropin, a drug used to treat [[dwarfism]], was Genentech's first marketed drug and its $2 billion in sales has contributed greatly to its position as an industry leader. The settlement was to be divided as follows: $30 million to the [[University of California finances|University of California General Fund]], $85 million to the three inventors and two collaborating scientists, $50 million towards a new teaching and research campus for UCSF, and $35 million to support university-wide research.<ref>{{cite news |last=Genentech Press Release| title = University of California and Genentech Settle Patent Infringement Lawsuits| url= http://www.gene.com/media/press-releases/4887/1999-11-19/university-of-california-and-genentech-s | work = Genentech, Inc.|accessdate=16 November 2015}}</ref>

In 2009, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Genentech's talking points on [[Health care reform in the United States|health care reform]] appeared verbatim in the official statements of several Members of [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] during the national health care reform debate.<ref>Pear, Robert.

In 2009, Avastin gained its fifth approval for treatment of [[glioblastoma multiforme]], and sixth approval for the treatment of metastatic [[renal cell carcinoma]]. It was most publicized for its approval in advanced breast cancer treatment, but the FDA approval for breast cancer treatment was subsequently revoked in November, 2011.

Tecentriq was granted accelerated approval for its advanced bladder cancer indication due to promising phase II results.
*2017 - [[Ocrelizumab|Ocrevus]] (ocrelizumab): The first FDA-approved therapy that treats both relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). The PPMS form of the disease previously had no approved treatments.
*Ongoing work: Genentech is working on [[DR6]] blocking and anti-N-[[Amyloid precursor protein|APP]] monoclonal antibodies as a potential treatment to delay progression of neuronal destruction in early [[Alzheimer's disease]].  To the extent that prevention of neuronal destruction via DR-6 and N-APP would require ongoing intervention, the effective half-life of any monoclonal antibody treatment would have to be substantial.  An siRNA approach against DR-6, or vaccine against N-APP may circumvent these limitations.
