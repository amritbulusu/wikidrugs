'''Rasburicase''' (trade names '''Elitek''' in the US and '''Fasturtec''' in Europe) is a [[medication]] that helps to clear [[uric acid]] from the [[blood]]. It is a [[recombinant DNA|recombinant]] version of [[urate oxidase]], an [[enzyme]] that metabolizes uric acid to [[allantoin]]. Urate oxidase is known to be present in many mammals but does not naturally occur in humans.<ref name="Wilson2012"/> Rasburicase is produced by a genetically modified [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]] strain. The [[complementary DNA|cDNA]] coding for rasburicase was cloned from a strain of [[Aspergillus flavus]].<ref name="Wilson2012">{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilson FP, Berns JS |title= Onco-nephrology: tumor lysis syndrome |journal=Clin J Am Soc Nephrol|date=October 2012 |volume=7 |issue=10 |pages=1730–9|pmid=22879434|url=http://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/7/10/1730.long|doi=10.2215/CJN.03150312}}</ref>

Rasburicase is a [[tetrameric protein]] with identical subunits. Each subunit is made up of a single 301 [[amino acid]] polypeptide chain with a molecular mass of about 34 [[Kilodalton|kDa]]. The drug product is a sterile, white to off-white, lyophilized powder intended for intravenous administration following reconstitution with a diluent. Elitek (rasburicase) is supplied in 3 mL and 10 mL colorless, glass vials containing rasburicase at a concentration of 1.5&nbsp;mg/mL after reconstitution.<ref name="Elitek rasburicase">{{cite web|title=Elitek (rasburicase)|url=http://www.rxlist.com/elitek-drug/clinical-pharmacology.htm|publisher=Rxlist}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
Rasburicase is approved for use by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (and European counterparts) for the prevention and treatment of [[tumor lysis syndrome]] (TLS)<ref name="pmid18632493">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ho VQ, Wetzstein GA, Patterson SG, Bradbury R |title=Abbreviated rasburicase dosing for the prevention and treatment of hyperuricemia in adults at risk for tumor lysis syndrome |journal=Supportive cancer therapy |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=178–82 |date=April 2006 |pmid=18632493 |doi=10.3816/SCT.2006.n.016 |url=http://cigjournals.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&id=doi:10.3816/SCT.2006.n.016}}</ref> in people receiving [[chemotherapy]] for [[Tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues|hematologic cancers]] such as [[leukemia]]s and [[lymphoma]]s.

==Side effects==
Rasburicase administration can cause [[anaphylaxis]] (incidence unknown); [[methemoglobinemia]] may occur in susceptible individuals such as those with [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency|G6PDH deficiency]] due to the production of hydrogen peroxide in the urate oxidase reaction.<ref name="Wilson2012"/> Testing patients for G6PDH deficiency prior to starting a course of rasburicase has been recommended.<ref name="Wilson2012"/>

==Pharmacology==

=== Mechanism of Action ===
In humans, [[uric acid]] is the final step in the catabolic pathway of purines. Rasburicase catalyzes enzymatic oxidation of poorly soluble uric acid into an inactive and more soluble metabolite allantoin with [[carbon dioxide]] and [[hydrogen peroxide]] as byproducts in the chemical reaction.<ref name="Wilson2012"/>

=== Pharmacodynamics ===
The measurement of plasma uric acid was used to evaluate the effectiveness of rasburicase in clinical studies. Following administration of either 0.15 or 0.20&nbsp;mg/kg rasburicase daily for up to 5 days, plasma uric acid levels decreased within 4 hours and were maintained below 7.5&nbsp;mg/dL in 98% of adult and 90% of pediatric patients for at least 7 days. There was no evidence of a dose response effect on uric acid control for doses between 0.15 and 0.20&nbsp;mg/kg rasburicase.<ref name="Elitek rasburicase"/>

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
The pharmacokinetics of rasburicase were evaluated in both pediatric and adult patients with [[leukemia]], [[lymphoma]] or other hematological malignancies. Rasburicase exposure, as measured by AUC0-24 hr and Cmax, tended to increase with a dose range from 0.15 to 0.2&nbsp;mg/kg. The mean terminal half-life was similar between pediatric and adult patients and ranged from 15.7 to 22.5 hours. The mean volume of distribution of rasburicase ranged from 110 to 127 mL/kg in pediatric patients and from 75.8 to 138 mL/kg in adult patients, respectively. Minimal accumulation of rasburicase ( < 1.3 fold) was observed between days 1 and 5 of dosing. In adults, age, gender, baseline liver enzymes and creatinine clearance did not impact the pharmacokinetics of rasburicase. A cross-study comparison revealed that after administration of rasburicase at 0.15 or 0.20&nbsp;mg/kg, the geometric mean values of body-weight normalized clearance were approximately 40% lower in Japanese (n=20) than that in Caucasians (n=22).<ref name="Elitek rasburicase"/>
