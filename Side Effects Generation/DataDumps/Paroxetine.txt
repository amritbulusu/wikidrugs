==Adverse effects==
{{See also|List of adverse effects of paroxetine}}

Paroxetine shares many of the common adverse effects of SSRIs, including (with the corresponding rates seen in people treated with placebo in parentheses): nausea 26% (9%), diarrhea 12% (8%), constipation 14% (9%), dry mouth 18% (12%), somnolence 23% (9%), insomnia 13% (6%), headache 18% (17%), [[hypomania]] 1% (0.3%), blurred vision 4%(1%), loss of appetite 6% (2%), nervousness 5% (3%), [[paraesthesia]] 4% (2%), dizziness 13% (6%), asthenia (weakness; 15% (6%)), tremor 8% (2%), sweating 11% (2%), and sexual dysfunction (≥10% incidence).<ref name = MSR/> Most of these adverse effects are transient and go away with continued treatment. Central and peripheral [[5-HT3 receptor|5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor]] stimulation is believed to result in the gastrointestinal effects observed with SSRI treatment.<ref name = GG/> Compared to other SSRIs, it has a lower incidence of diarrhea, a higher incidence of anticholinergic effects (e.g., dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, etc.), sedation/somnolence/drowsiness, sexual side effects, and weight gain.<ref name="PhDep"/>

Due to reports of adverse withdrawal reactions upon terminating treatment, the [[Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use]] (CHMP) at the [[European Medicines Agency]] recommends gradually reducing over several weeks or months if the decision to withdraw is made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Press_release/2009/11/WC500015202.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=European Medicines Agency|title=Press release, CHMP meeting on Paroxetine and other SSRIs|date=2004-12-09|accessdate=2007-08-24}}</ref> See also [[Paroxetine#Discontinuation syndrome|Discontinuation syndrome (withdrawal)]].

===Sexual dysfunction===
{{See also|Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor#Sexual dysfunction}}
Sexual dysfunction, including loss of libido, [[anorgasmia]], lack of vaginal lubrication, and [[erectile dysfunction]], is one of the most commonly encountered adverse effects of treatment with paroxetine and other SSRIs. While early clinical trials suggested a relatively low rate of sexual dysfunction, more recent studies in which the investigator actively inquires about sexual problems suggest that the incidence is higher than 70%.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Clark MS, Jansen K, Bresnahan M |title=Clinical inquiry: How do antidepressants affect sexual function? |journal=J Fam Pract |volume=62 |issue=11 |pages=660–1 |date=November 2013  |pmid=24288712 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Symptoms of sexual dysfunction have been reported to persist after discontinuing SSRIs, although this is thought to be occasional.<ref name=Csoka2008>{{cite journal |vauthors=Csoka AB, Csoka A, Bahrick A, Mehtonen OP | title = Persistent sexual dysfunction after discontinuation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors | journal = The Journal of Sexual Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 227–33 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18173768 | doi = 10.1111/j.1743-6109.2007.00630.x }}</ref><ref name=Csoka2006>{{cite journal |vauthors=Csoka AB, Shipko S | title = Persistent sexual side effects after SSRI discontinuation | journal = Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = 187–8 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16636635 | doi = 10.1159/000091777 | url = http://www.mediafire.com/view/hn31cmg4n28bq3x/06_pssd_Csoka.pdf | accessdate = 30 January 2014 }}</ref><ref>http://pi.lilly.com/us/prozac.pdf Page 14.</ref>

===Pregnancy===
The [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] recommends that for pregnant women and women planning to become pregnant, "treatment with all SSRIs or selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors or both during pregnancy be individualized and paroxetine use among pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant be avoided, if possible".<ref name="Committee2006"/> According to the prescribing information, "epidemiological studies have shown that infants born to women who had first trimester paroxetine exposure had an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations, primarily ventricular and atrial septal defects (VSDs and ASDs). In general, septal defects range from those that are symptomatic and may require surgery to those that are asymptomatic and may resolve spontaneously. If a patient becomes pregnant while taking paroxetine, she should be advised of the potential harm to the fetus. Unless the benefits of paroxetine to the mother justify continuing treatment, consideration should be given to either discontinuing paroxetine therapy or switching to another antidepressant."<ref name="gsk-paxil">{{cite web|url=http://us.gsk.com/products/assets/us_paxil.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61Bq63bfe?url=http%3A%2F%2Fus.gsk.com%2Fproducts%2Fassets%2Fus_paxil.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-25 |format=PDF |title=PAXIL (paroxetine hydrochloride) Tablets and Oral Suspension: PRESCRIBING INFORMATION |date=August 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-14 |publisher=[[GlaxoSmithKline]] |location=Research Triangle Park, NC |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref> These conclusions are supported by multiple [[systematic review]]s and meta-analyses that found that, on average, the use of paroxetine during pregnancy is associated with about 1.5–1.7-fold increase in congenital birth defects, in particular, heart defects.<ref name="pmid16926304">{{cite journal | author = Thormahlen GM | title = Paroxetine use during pregnancy: is it safe? | journal = Ann Pharmacother | volume = 40 | issue = 10 | pages = 1834–7 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 16926304 | doi = 10.1345/aph.1H116 }}</ref><ref name="pmid17381382">{{cite journal | author = Way CM | title = Safety of newer antidepressants in pregnancy | journal = Pharmacotherapy | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 546–52 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17381382 | doi = 10.1592/phco.27.4.546 }}</ref><ref name="pmid17397101">{{cite journal |vauthors=Bellantuono C, Migliarese G, Gentile S | title = Serotonin reuptake inhibitors in pregnancy and the risk of major malformations: a systematic review | journal = Hum Psychopharmacol | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 121–8 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17397101 | doi = 10.1002/hup.836 }}</ref><ref name="pmid17688379">{{cite journal | author = Källén B | title = The safety of antidepressant drugs during pregnancy | journal = Expert Opin Drug Saf | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 357–70 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17688379 | doi = 10.1517/14740338.6.4.357 }}</ref><ref name="pmid17697910">{{cite journal |vauthors=Bar-Oz B, Einarson T, Einarson A, Boskovic R, O'Brien L, Malm H, Bérard A, Koren G | title = Paroxetine and congenital malformations: meta-Analysis and consideration of potential confounding factors | journal = Clin Ther | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = 918–26 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17697910 | doi = 10.1016/j.clinthera.2007.05.003 }}</ref>

===Discontinuation syndrome===
{{See also|SSRI discontinuation syndrome}}
Many psychoactive medications can cause withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation from administration. Evidence has shown that paroxetine has among the highest incidence rates and severity of withdrawal syndrome of any medication of its class.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1382551.stm |work=BBC News |title=Anti-depressant addiction warning |date=2001-06-11|accessdate=2010-05-21}}</ref>{{mcn|date=October 2015}} Common withdrawal symptoms for paroxetine include nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness and vertigo; insomnia, nightmares and vivid dreams; feelings of electricity in the body, as well as crying and anxiety.{{mcn|date=October 2015}} Liquid formulation of paroxetine is available and allows a very gradual decrease of the dose, which may prevent discontinuation syndrome. Another recommendation is to temporarily switch to [[fluoxetine]], which has a longer [[half-life]] and thus decreases the severity of discontinuation syndrome.<ref name="Drug Saf2001-Haddad">{{cite journal |last=Haddad |first=Peter M. |name-list-format=vanc |title = Antidepressant discontinuation syndromes|journal = Drug Saf|volume = 24|issue = 3|pages = 183–97|date=March 2001|pmid = 11347722|doi = 10.2165/00002018-200124030-00003 |subscription=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Haddad |first1=Peter M. |last2=Anderson |first2=Ian M. |name-list-format=vanc |date=November 2007 |title=Recognising and managing antidepressant discontinuation symptoms|journal=Advances in Psychiatric Treatment |volume=13 |issue=6|pages=447–457|doi=10.1192/apt.bp.105.001966 |doi-access=free |url=http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/13/6/447.full }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.benzo.org.uk/healy.htm |title=Dependence on Antidepressants & Halting SSRIs |first=David |last=Healy |website=benzo.org.uk |access-date=2013-04-23 }}</ref>{{Unreliable medical source|date=January 2017}}

==Overdose==
Acute overdosage is often manifested by [[emesis]], [[lethargy]], [[ataxia]], [[tachycardia]], and [[seizures]]. Plasma, serum, or blood concentrations of paroxetine may be measured to monitor therapeutic administration, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of fatalities. Plasma paroxetine concentrations are generally in a range of 40–400 μg/L in persons receiving daily therapeutic doses and 200–2,000 μg/L in poisoned patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 1–4&nbsp;mg/L in acute lethal overdose situations.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Goeringer KE, Raymon L, Christian GD, Logan BK | title = Postmortem forensic toxicology of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: a review of pharmacology and report of 168 cases | journal = J.

==Interactions==
Interactions with other drugs acting on the serotonin system or impairing the metabolism of serotonin may increase the risk of [[Serotonin Syndrome]] or [[Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome]] (NMS)-like reaction.  Such reactions have been observed with SNRIs and SSRIs alone, but particularly with concurrent use of [[triptan]]s, [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAO inhibitors]], antipsychotics, or other dopamine antagonists.

Paroxetine might interact with [[statins]], resulting in increased blood glucose levels. This was demonstrated in a small [[retrospective study]] and needs confirmation in a prospective study.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Andrade|first1=C|title=Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor drug interactions in patients receiving statins.|journal=The Journal of clinical psychiatry|date=February 2014|volume=75|issue=2|pages=e95-9|pmid=24602259|url=http://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/article/Pages/2014/v75n02/v75n0201.aspx}}</ref>

The prescribing information states that paroxetine should "not be used in combination with an [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAOI]] (including linezolid, an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI), or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an MAOI", and should not be used in combination with [[pimozide]], [[thioridazine]], [[tryptophan]], or [[warfarin]].<ref name="gsk-paxil"/>

===Withdrawal symptoms===

In 2002 the U.S. FDA published a warning regarding "severe" discontinuation symptoms among those terminating paroxetine treatment, including paraesthesia, bad dreams, and dizziness. The Agency also warned of case reports describing agitation, sweating, and nausea. In connection with a Glaxo spokesperson's statement that withdrawal reactions occur only in 0.2% of patients and are "mild and short-lived", the [[IFPMA|International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations]] said GSK had breached two of the Federation's codes of practice.<ref name="pmid11823353">{{cite journal |author = Tonks A|title = Withdrawal from paroxetine can be severe, warns FDA|journal = BMJ|volume = 324|issue = 7332|page = 260|date = February 2002|pmid = 11823353|pmc = 1122195|doi = 10.1136/bmj.324.7332.260}}</ref>

In early 2004, GSK agreed to settle charges of consumer fraud for $2.5 million.<ref>{{cite news |author=Angell M |authorlink=Marcia Angell |title=Drug Companies & Doctors: A Story of Corruption|newspaper=[[New York Review of Books]] |volume=56 |issue=1 |date=15 January 2009 }}</ref> The [[legal discovery]] process also uncovered evidence of deliberate, systematic suppression of unfavorable Paxil research results. One of GSK's internal documents read, "It would be commercially unacceptable to include a statement that efficacy [in children] had not been demonstrated, as this would undermine the profile of paroxetine".<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kondro W, Sibbald B | title = Drug company experts advised staff to withhold data about SSRI use in children | journal = CMAJ | volume = 170 | issue = 5 | page = 783 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 14993169 | pmc = 343848 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.1040213 }}</ref>

In 2012 the [[U.S. Justice Department]] announced that GSK had agreed to plead guilty and pay a $3 billion fine, in part for promoting the use of Paxil for children.<ref name=ThomasNYT2July2012/>

On 12 February 2016, the UK [[Competition and Markets Authority]] imposed record fines of £45 million on companies which were found to have infringed [[European Union]] and UK Competition law by entering into agreements to delay the market entry of [[Generic drug|generic]] versions of the drug in the UK. [[GlaxoSmithKline]] received the bulk of the fines, being fined £37,600,757. Other companies, which produce generics, were issued fines which collectively total £7,384,146. UK public health services are likely to claim damages for being overcharged in the period where the generic versions of the drug were illegally blocked from the market, as the generics are over 70% less expensive. [[GlaxoSmithKline]] may also face actions from other generics manufacturers who incurred loss as a result of the anticompetitive conduct.<ref>https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-fines-pharma-companies-45-million</ref> On 18 April 2016, appeals were lodged with the [[Competition Appeal Tribunal]] by the companies which were fined.<ref>http://www.catribunal.org.uk/files/1252_GlaxoSmithKline_Summary_180416.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.catribunal.org.uk/files/1251_Generics_Summary_180416.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.catribunal.org.uk/files/1253_Xellia_Summary_180416.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.catribunal.org.uk/files/1255_Merck_Summary_180416.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.catribunal.org.uk/files/1254_Actavis_Summary_180416.pdf</ref>

==Research==
Several studies have suggested that paroxetine can be used in the treatment of [[premature ejaculation]]. In particular, intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) was found to increase with 6–13-fold, which was somewhat longer than the delay achieved by the treatment with other SSRIs (fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, sertraline, and citalopram).<ref name="pmid9690692">{{cite journal |vauthors=Waldinger MD, Hengeveld MW, Zwinderman AH, Olivier B | title = Effect of SSRI antidepressants on ejaculation: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study with fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 274–81 | date = August 1998 | pmid = 9690692 | doi = 10.1097/00004714-199808000-00004 }}</ref><ref name="pmid11763001">{{cite journal |vauthors=Waldinger MD, Zwinderman AH, Olivier B | title = SSRIs and ejaculation: a double-blind, randomized, fixed-dose study with paroxetine and citalopram | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 556–60 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11763001 | doi = 10.1097/00004714-200112000-00003 }}</ref><ref name="pmid15363569">{{cite journal |vauthors=Waldinger MD, Zwinderman AH, Olivier B | title = On-demand treatment of premature ejaculation with clomipramine and paroxetine: a randomized, double-blind fixed-dose study with stopwatch assessment | journal = Eur.
