==Medical use==
Cisplatin is administered [[intravenously]] as short-term infusion in normal saline for treatment of solid malignancies. It is used to treat various types of cancers, including [[sarcoma]]s, some [[carcinoma]]s (e.g., [[lung cancer|small cell lung cancer]], [[squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck]] and [[ovarian cancer]]), [[lymphoma]]s, [[bladder cancer]], [[cervical cancer]],<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[National Cancer Institute]] |title=Cisplatin |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/druginfo/cisplatin |access-date=2014-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008032500/http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/druginfo/cisplatin |archivedate=8 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and [[germ cell tumor]]s.

Cisplatin is particularly effective against testicular cancer; the cure rate was improved from 10% to 85%.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Einhorn LH | title = Treatment of testicular cancer: a new and improved model | journal = J. Clin. Oncol. | volume = 8 | issue = 11 | pages = 1777–81 | date = 1 November 1990 | pmid = 1700077 | url = http://jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/8/11/1777 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090422031132/http://jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/abstract/8/11/1777 | archivedate = 22 April 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

In addition, cisplatin is used in [[Auger therapy]].

==Side effects==
Cisplatin has a number of side effects that can limit its use:
* [[Nephrotoxicity]] (kidney damage) is a major concern. The dose is reduced when the patient's creatinine clearance (a measure of [[renal function]]) is reduced. Adequate hydration and [[diuretic|diuresis]] is used to prevent renal damage. The nephrotoxicity of platinum-class drugs seems to be related to [[reactive oxygen species]] and in animal models can be ameliorated by [[free radical]] scavenging agents (e.g., [[amifostine]]). Nephrotoxicity is a dose-limiting side effect.<ref name="pmid6370067">{{cite journal | last1= Loehrer |first1=P. J. |last2=Einhorn |first2=L. H. | title = Drugs five years later. Cisplatin | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 704–13 | date = May 1984 | pmid = 6370067 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-100-5-704  }}</ref> 
* [[Neurotoxicity]] (nerve damage) can be anticipated by performing [[nerve conduction studies]] before and after treatment. Common neurological side effects of cisplatin include visual perception and hearing disorder, which can occur soon after treatment begins.<ref name="Milosavljevic_2010">{{cite journal | last1= Milosavljevic |first1=N. |last2=Duranton |first2=C. |last3=Djerbi |first3=N. |last4=Puech |first4=P. H. |last5=Gounon |first5=P. |last6=Lagadic-Gossmann |first6=D. |last7=Dimanche-Boitrel |first7=M.

Recent studies have shown that cisplatin noncompetitively inhibits an archetypal, membrane-bound mechanosensitive sodium-hydrogen ion transporter known as [[SLC9A1|NHE-1]].<ref name="Milosavljevic_2010"/> It is primarily found on cells of the peripheral nervous system, which are aggregated in large numbers near the ocular and aural stimuli-receiving centers. This noncompetitive interaction has been linked to hydroelectrolytic imbalances and cytoskeleton alterations, both of which have been confirmed in vitro and in vivo. However, NHE-1 inhibition has been found to be both dose-dependent (half-inhibition = 30&nbsp;µg/mL) and reversible.<ref name="Milosavljevic_2010"/>  
* [[Nausea]] and [[vomiting]]: cisplatin is one of the most emetogenic chemotherapy agents, but this symptom is managed with prophylactic antiemetics ([[ondansetron]], [[granisetron]], etc.) in combination with [[corticosteroids]]. [[Aprepitant]] combined with [[ondansetron]] and [[dexamethasone]] has been shown to be better for highly emetogenic chemotherapy than just [[ondansetron]] and [[dexamethasone]].
* [[Ototoxicity]] (hearing loss): there is at present no effective treatment to prevent this side effect, which may be severe.  Audiometric analysis may be necessary to assess the severity of ototoxicity. Other drugs (such as the aminoglycoside antibiotic class) may also cause ototoxicity, and the administration of this class of antibiotics in patients receiving cisplatin is generally avoided.  The ototoxicity of both the aminoglycosides and cisplatin may be related to their ability to bind to [[melanin]] in the [[stria vascularis]] of the inner ear or the generation of [[reactive oxygen species]].
* [[Electrolyte disturbance]]: Cisplatin can cause hypomagnesaemia, hypokalaemia and hypocalcaemia. The hypocalcaemia seems to occur in those with low serum magnesium secondary to cisplatin, so it is not primarily due to the cisplatin.
* [[Hemolytic anemia]] can be developed after several courses of cisplatin. It is suggested that an antibody reacting with a cisplatin-red-cell membrane is responsible for [[hemolysis]].<ref name="pmid6788166">{{cite journal | last1= Levi|first1= J.

== Mechanism of action ==
Cisplatin interferes with DNA replication, which kills the fastest proliferating cells, which in theory are carcinogenic.  Following administration, one of the two chloride ligands is slowly displaced by water to give the [[aquo complex]] ''cis''-[PtCl(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)]<sup>+</sup>, in a process termed [[aquation]].  Dissociation of the chloride ligand is favored inside the cell because the intracellular chloride concentration is only 3–20% of the approximately 100&nbsp;mM chloride concentration in the extracellular fluid.<ref name="WangLippard2005">{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Dong|last2=Lippard|first2=Stephen J.|title=Cellular processing of platinum anticancer drugs|journal=Nature Reviews Drug Discovery|volume=4|issue=4|year=2005|pages=307–320|issn=1474-1776|doi=10.1038/nrd1691}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first1=Timothy C. |last1=Johnstone |first2=Kogularamanan |last2=Suntharalingam |first3=Stephen J. |last3=Lippard |title=The Next Generation of Platinum Drugs: Targeted Pt(II) Agents, Nanoparticle Delivery, and Pt(IV) Prodrugs |journal=[[Chem.

The  aqua ligand in ''cis''-[PtCl(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)]<sup>+</sup> is itself easily displaced by the ''N''-[[heterocyclic base]]s on [[DNA]]. [[Guanine]] preferentially binds. Subsequent to formation of [PtCl(guanine-DNA)(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>, crosslinking can occur via displacement of the other chloride ligand, typically by another guanine.<ref name = trzaska/> Cisplatin crosslinks DNA in several different ways, interfering with cell division by [[mitosis]]. The damaged DNA elicits [[DNA repair]] mechanisms, which in turn activate [[apoptosis]] when repair proves impossible. In 2008, researchers were able to show that the  [[apoptosis]] induced by cisplatin on human colon cancer cells depends on the mitochondrial serine-protease [[HTRA2|Omi/Htra2]].<ref name="pmid18606591">{{cite journal | last1= Pruefer |first1=F. G. |last2=Lizarraga |first2=F. |last3=Maldonado|first3= V. |last4=Melendez-Zajgla |first4=J. | title = Participation of Omi HtrA2 serine–protease activity in the apoptosis induced by cisplatin on SW480 colon cancer cells | journal = J. Chemother. | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 348–54 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18606591 | doi = 10.1179/joc.2008.20.3.348 }}</ref> Since this was only demonstrated for colon carcinoma cells, it remains an open question if the Omi/Htra2 protein participates in the cisplatin-induced apoptosis in carcinomas from other tissues.

Most notable among the changes in DNA are the 1,2-intrastrand cross-links with [[purine]] bases. These include 1,2-intrastrand d([[guanine|Gp]]G) adducts which form nearly 90% of the adducts and the less common 1,2-intrastrand d([[adenosine|Ap]]G) adducts. 1,3-intrastrand d(GpXpG) adducts occur but are readily excised by the [[nucleotide]] excision repair ([[nucleotide excision repair|NER]]). Other adducts include inter-strand crosslinks and nonfunctional adducts that have been postulated to contribute to cisplatin's activity. Interaction with cellular proteins, particularly [[high mobility group|HMG]] domain proteins, has also been advanced as a mechanism of interfering with mitosis, although this is probably not its primary method of action.

Although cisplatin is frequently designated as an [[alkylating agent]], it has no [[alkyl]] group and it therefore cannot carry out alkylating reactions. It is correctly classified as alkylating-like.

=== Cisplatin resistance ===
Cisplatin combination chemotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment of many cancers. Initial platinum responsiveness is high but the majority of cancer patients will eventually relapse with cisplatin-resistant disease. Many mechanisms of cisplatin resistance have been proposed including changes in cellular uptake and efflux of the drug, increased detoxification of the drug, inhibition of [[apoptosis]] and increased [[DNA repair]].<ref name="Stordal_2007">{{cite journal | last1= Stordal |first1=B|last2=Davey|first2= M. | title = Understanding cisplatin resistance using cellular models | journal = IUBMB Life | volume = 59 | issue = 11 | pages = 696–9 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17885832 | doi = 10.1080/15216540701636287 }}</ref> [[Oxaliplatin]] is active in highly cisplatin-resistant cancer cells in the laboratory; however, there is little evidence for its activity in the clinical treatment of patients with cisplatin-resistant cancer.<ref name="Stordal_2007"/> The drug [[paclitaxel]] may be useful in the treatment of cisplatin-resistant cancer; the mechanism for this activity is unknown.<ref name="pmid17881133">{{cite journal | last1= Stordal|first1= B.|last2= Pavlakis |first2=N.|last3= Davey |first3=R. | title = A systematic review of platinum and taxane resistance from bench to clinic: an inverse relationship | journal = Cancer Treat.

===Transplatin===
Transplatin, the [[trans isomer|trans]] [[stereoisomer]] of cisplatin, has formula ''trans''-[PtCl<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] and does not exhibit a comparably useful pharmacological effect. Its low activity is generally thought to be due to rapid deactivation of the drug before it can arrive at the DNA.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}  It is toxic, and it is desirable to test batches of cisplatin for the absence of the trans isomer.  In a procedure by Woollins et al., which is based on the classic [[Kurnakov test]], [[thiourea]] reacts with the sample to give derivatives which can easily be separated and detected by [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1= Woollins |first1=J.
