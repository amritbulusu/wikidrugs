'''Dexketoprofen''' is a [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] (NSAID).  It is manufactured by [[Menarini]], under the tradename '''Keral'''.  It is available in the [[UK]], as '''dexketoprofen trometamol''', as a prescription-only drug and in Latin America as '''Enantyum''', produced by Menarini. Also, in [[Italy]] and [[Spain]] it is available as an [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter drug (OTC)]] under the tradenames '''Enantyum''', and '''Ketesgel''', respectively. In [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Estonia]] it is available as an OTC under the tradename '''Dolmen'''.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://193.40.10.165/register/register.php?lk=1&otsi=J&keel=eng&inim_vet=inim&raviminimi=&ta_inglise=Dexketoprofen |title = Medicinal products authorised in Estonia |date = 22 May 2014 |website = State Agency of Medicine |accessdate = 23 May 2014 }}</ref> In Mexico it is available in tablet form as "Stadium" made by Menarini. It is the [[dextrorotatory]] [[stereoisomer]] of [[ketoprofen]].<ref>http://topics.sciencedirect.com/topics/page/Dexketoprofen</ref>

==Medical uses==
Short-term treatment of mild to moderate [[pain]], including [[dysmenorrhoea]].

==Side effects==
It may cause dizziness, and patients should not, therefore, drive or operate heavy machinery or vehicles until they are familiar with how dexketoprofen affects them. Concomitant use of alcohol and other sedatives may potentiate this effect. In a small subset of individuals the dizziness may be intolerable and require transition to an alternative treatment.

==Pharmacology==
Dexketoprofen belongs to a class of medicines called NSAIDs. It works by blocking the action of a substance in the body called [[cyclo-oxygenase]], which is involved in the production of chemicals in the body called [[prostaglandins]]. Prostaglandins are produced in response to injury or certain diseases and would otherwise go on to cause swelling, inflammation and pain. By blocking cyclo-oxygenase, dexketoprofen prevents the production of prostaglandins and therefore reduces inflammation and pain. Along with peripheral analgesic action, it possesses central analgesic action.
