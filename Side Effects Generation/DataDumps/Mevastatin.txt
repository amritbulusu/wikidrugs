'''Mevastatin''' ('''compactin''', '''ML-236B''') is a [[hypolipidemic agent]] that belongs to the [[statin]]s class.

It was isolated from the mold ''[[Penicillium citrinum]]'' by [[Akira Endo (biochemist)|Akira Endo]] in the 1970s, and he identified it as a [[HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor]],<ref>{{cite journal|first=Akira|last=Endo|author2=Kuroda M. |author3=Tsujita Y. |title=ML-236A, ML-236B, and ML-236C, new inhibitors of cholesterogenesis produced by Penicillium citrinium|journal=Journal of Antibiotics (Tokyo)|date=December 1976|volume=29|issue=12|pages=1346–8|pmid=1010803|doi=10.7164/antibiotics.29.1346}}</ref> i.e., a statin.

Mevastatin has since been derivatized to the compound [[pravastatin]], which is a pharmaceutical used in the lowering of [[cholesterol]] and preventing [[cardiovascular disease]].

== Biosynthesis ==
Biosynthesis of mevastatin is primarily accomplished via a type 1 [[Polyketide synthase|PKS pathway]] it proceeds in the PKS pathway as seen in figure 1 until it reaches a hexaketide state where it undergoes a [[Diels–Alder reaction|Diels-Alder]] cyclization. After cyclization it continues via the PKS pathway to a nonaketide after which it is released and undergoes oxidation and dehydration. It is presumed that the oxidations are preformed by a polypeptide that is similar to cytochrome p450 monooxygenase, which is encoded by ''mlc''C within the mevastatin gene. Lastly the biosynthesis is completed by the PKS facilitating the addition of a diketide sidechain and a methylation by [[S-adenosylmethionine synthetase enzyme|SAM]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Abe|first=Y.|last2=Suzuki|first2=T.|last3=Ono|first3=C.|last4=Iwamoto|first4=K.|last5=Hosobuchi|first5=M.|last6=Yoshikawa|first6=H.|date=2002-07-01|title=Molecular cloning and characterization of an ML-236B (compactin) biosynthetic gene cluster in Penicillium citrinum|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00438-002-0697-y|journal=Molecular Genetics and Genomics|language=en|volume=267|issue=5|pages=636–646|doi=10.1007/s00438-002-0697-y|issn=1617-4615}}</ref> Figure 1 shows mevastatin in its acid form but it can also be in the more commonly seen lactone form. This pathway was first observed in ''Penicillium cilrinum'' and was later discovered that another type of fungus, ''Penicillium brevicompaetum'' also produced mevastatin via a PKS pathway.

== Pharmacology ==
Sustained elevations of cholesterol in the blood increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Mevastatin acts to lowers hepatic production of cholesterol by competitively inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway via the mevalonic acid pathway. When hepatic cholesterol levels are decreased it causes an increased uptake of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and reduces cholesterol levels in the circulation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Mevastatin#section=Pharmacology-and-Biochemistry|title=Mevastatin {{!}} C23H34O5 - PubChem|last=Pubchem|website=pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2016-06-04}}</ref> It has also been shown that mevastatin upregulates [[Endothelial NOS|endothelial nitric oxide synthase]] (eNOS), which is essential for maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Amin-Hanjani|first=Sepideh|last2=Stagliano|first2=Nancy E.|last3=Yamada|first3=Masaru|last4=Huang|first4=Paul L.|last5=Liao|first5=James K.|last6=Moskowitz|first6=Michael A.|date=2001-04-01|title=Mevastatin, an HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitor, Reduces Stroke Damage and Upregulates Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase in Mice|url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/32/4/980|journal=Stroke|language=en|volume=32|issue=4|pages=980–986|doi=10.1161/01.STR.32.4.980|issn=0039-2499|pmid=11283400}}</ref>
