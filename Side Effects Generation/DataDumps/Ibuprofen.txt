===Interactions===
Drinking alcohol when taking ibuprofen may increase the risk of stomach bleeding.<ref name=drugs>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/ibuprofen.html|title=Ibuprofen|publisher=Drugs.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806064653/http://www.drugs.com/ibuprofen.html|archivedate=6 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

According to the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|US Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), "ibuprofen can interfere with the [[antiplatelet]] effect of low-dose aspirin, potentially rendering aspirin less effective when used for cardioprotection and [[stroke]] prevention." Allowing sufficient time between doses of ibuprofen and immediate-release (IR) aspirin can avoid this problem. The recommended elapsed time between a dose of ibuprofen and a dose of aspirin depends on which is taken first. It would be 30 minutes or more for ibuprofen taken after IR aspirin, and eight hours or more for ibuprofen taken before IR aspirin. However, this timing cannot be recommended for [[Enteric coating|enteric-coated]] aspirin. But, if ibuprofen is taken only occasionally without the recommended timing, the reduction of the cardioprotection and stroke prevention of a daily aspirin regimen is minimal.<ref name='FDA2006'>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm125222.htm|title=Information for Healthcare Professionals: Concomitant Use of Ibuprofen and Aspirin|accessdate=22 November 2010|date=September 2006|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113035657/http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm125222.htm|archivedate=13 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Overdose===
Ibuprofen overdose has become common since it was licensed for [[Over-the-counter_drug|OTC]] use. Many overdose experiences are reported in the [[Medical journal|medical literature]], although the frequency of life-threatening complications from ibuprofen overdose is low.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McElwee|first1=NE|last2=Veltri|first2=JC|last3=Bradford|first3=DC|last4=Rollins|first4=DE|title=A prospective, population-based study of acute ibuprofen overdose: complications are rare and routine serum levels not warranted.|journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine|date=June 1990|volume=19|issue=6|pages=657–62|doi=10.1016/S0196-0644(05)82471-0|pmid=2188537}}</ref> Human response in cases of overdose ranges from absence of symptoms to fatal outcome despite intensive-care treatment. Most symptoms are an excess of the pharmacological action of ibuprofen, and include [[abdominal pain]], nausea, [[vomiting]], drowsiness, dizziness, headache, [[tinnitus]], and [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]]. Rarely, more severe symptoms, such as [[gastrointestinal bleeding]], [[seizures]], [[metabolic acidosis]], [[hyperkalaemia]], [[hypotension]], [[bradycardia]], [[tachycardia]], [[atrial fibrillation]], [[coma]], liver dysfunction, [[acute renal failure]], [[cyanosis]], [[Hypoventilation|respiratory depression]], and [[cardiac arrest]] have been reported.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Vale|first1=JA|last2=Meredith|first2=TJ|title=Acute poisoning due to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Clinical features and management.|journal=Medical Toxicology|date=January 1986|volume=1|issue=1|pages=12–31|pmid=3537613}}</ref> The severity of symptoms varies with the ingested dose and the time elapsed; however, individual sensitivity also plays an important role. Generally, the symptoms observed with an overdose of ibuprofen are similar to the symptoms caused by overdoses of other NSAIDs.

Correlation between severity of symptoms and measured ibuprofen plasma levels is weak. Toxic effects are unlikely at doses below 100&nbsp;mg/kg, but can be severe above 400&nbsp;mg/kg (around 150 tablets of 200&nbsp;mg units for an average man);<ref name = Clinicalmedicine2003-Volans>{{cite journal|last1=Volans|first1=G|last2=Hartley|first2=V|last3=McCrea|first3=S|last4=Monaghan|first4=J|title=Non-opioid analgesic poisoning.|journal=Clinical Medicine|date=March–April 2003|volume=3|issue=2|pages=119–23|pmid=12737366|doi=10.7861/clinmedicine.3-2-119}}</ref> however, large doses do not indicate the clinical course is likely to be lethal.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Seifert|first1=SA|last2=Bronstein|first2=AC|last3=McGuire|first3=T|title=Massive ibuprofen ingestion with survival.|journal=Journal of Toxicology.

Therapy is largely symptomatic. In cases presenting early, gastric decontamination is recommended. This is achieved using [[activated charcoal]]; charcoal adsorbs the drug before it can enter the [[systemic circulation]]. [[Gastric lavage]] is now rarely used, but can be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening, and it can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion.

==Pharmacology==
NSAIDs such as ibuprofen work by [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibiting]] the [[cyclooxygenase]] (COX) [[enzyme]]s, which convert [[arachidonic acid]] to [[Prostaglandin H2|prostaglandin H<sub>2</sub>]] (PGH<sub>2</sub>). PGH<sub>2</sub>, in turn, is converted by other enzymes to several other [[prostaglandin]]s (which are mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever) and to [[thromboxane A2|thromboxane A<sub>2</sub>]] (which stimulates [[platelet]] aggregation, leading to the formation of [[thrombus|blood clots]]).

Like aspirin and [[indometacin]], ibuprofen is a nonselective COX inhibitor, in that it inhibits two [[isozyme|isoforms]] of cyclooxygenase, COX-1 and COX-2. The [[analgesic]], [[antipyretic]], and anti-inflammatory activity of NSAIDs appears to operate mainly through inhibition of COX-2, which decreases the synthesis of prostaglandins involved in mediating inflammation, pain, fever, and swelling. Antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in an increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation.  Inhibition of COX-1 instead would be responsible for unwanted effects on the gastrointestinal tract.<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Rao| first1=P|last2=Knaus|first2=EE|title=Evolution of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition and beyond.|journal=Journal of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences|date=20 September 2008|volume=11|issue=2|pages=81s–110s|pmid=19203472}}</ref> However, the role of the individual COX isoforms in the analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and gastric damage effects of NSAIDs is uncertain and different compounds cause different degrees of analgesia and gastric damage.<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Kakuta| first1=H| last2=Zheng|first2=X|last3=Oda|first3=H|last4=Harada|first4=S|last5=Sugimoto|first5=Y|last6=Sasaki|first6=K|last7=Tai|first7=A|title=Cyclooxygenase-1-selective inhibitors are attractive candidates for analgesics that do not cause gastric damage. design and in vitro/in vivo evaluation of a benzamide-type cyclooxygenase-1 selective inhibitor.|journal=Journal of Medicinal Chemistry|date=24 April 2008|volume=51| issue=8| pages=2400–11| doi=10.1021/jm701191z| pmid=18363350}}</ref>

Ibuprofen is administered as a racemic mixture. The R-enantiomer undergoes extensive interconversion to the S-enantiomer ''in vivo''. The S-enantiomer is believed to be the more pharmacologically active enantiomer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01050# |title=Ibuprofen: Pharmacology: Mechanism of Action.

==Chemistry==
Ibuprofen is practically insoluble in water, but very soluble in most organic solvents like [[ethanol]] (66.18 g/100mL at 40°C for 90% EtOH), [[methanol]], [[acetone]] and [[dichloromethane]].<ref name = MD>{{cite web|title=Ibuprofen|work=Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference|publisher=Pharmaceutical Press|location=London, UK|date=14 January 2014|accessdate=26 June 2014|url=http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/martindale/current/ms-2657-h.htm|editor=Brayfield, A}}</ref>

The original synthesis of ibuprofen by the Boots Group started with the compound 2-methylpropylbenzene. The synthesis took six steps. A modern, greener technique for the synthesis involves only three steps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/learn-chemistry/resources/chemistry-in-your-cupboard/nurofen/6|title=The Synthesis of Ibuprofen|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|access-date=14 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418202847/http://www.rsc.org/learn-chemistry/resources/chemistry-in-your-cupboard/nurofen/6|archivedate=18 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

It is an optically active compound with both ''S'' and ''R''-isomers, of which the ''S'' (dextrorotatory) isomer is the more biologically active; this isomer has also been isolated and used medically (see [[dexibuprofen]] for details).<ref name = MD/>

Ibuprofen is produced industrially as a [[racemate]]. The compound, like other 2-arylpropionate derivatives (including [[ketoprofen]], [[flurbiprofen]], [[naproxen]], etc.), does contain a stereocenter in the α-position of the [[propionate]] moiety. So two [[enantiomer]]s of ibuprofen occur, with the potential for different biological effects and metabolism for each enantiomer. Indeed, the (''S'')-(+)-ibuprofen ([[dexibuprofen]]) was found to be the active form both ''[[in vitro]]'' and ''[[in vivo]]''.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=February 2017}}
