'''Argatroban''' is an [[anticoagulant]] that is a small molecule [[direct thrombin inhibitor]].<ref>Di Nisio M, Middeldorp S, Buller HR. Direct thrombin inhibitors. ''[[N Engl J Med]]'' 2005;353:1028-40. {{PMID|16148288}}</ref>  In 2000, argatroban was licensed by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for prophylaxis or treatment of [[thrombosis]] in patients with [[heparin-induced thrombocytopenia]] (HIT).  In 2002, it was approved for use during [[Angioplasty|percutaneous coronary interventions]] in patients who have HIT or are at risk for developing it. In 2012, it was approved by the MHRA in the UK for anticoagulation in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia Type II (HIT) who require parenteral antithrombotic therapy.<ref>http://www.pharmatimes.com/Article/12-07-03/UK_launch_for_Mitsubishi_s_blood_thinner_Exembol.aspx</ref>

Argatroban is given intravenously and drug plasma concentrations reach steady state in 1–3 hours.<ref name="test">Dhillon S. Argatroban: A Review of its Use in the Management of Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia. ''Am J Cardiovasc Drugs'' 2009; 9 (4): 261-82. [http://adisonline.com/cardiovascular/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2009&issue=09040&article=00005&type=abstract Link text]</ref>  Argatroban is metabolized in the [[liver]] and has a [[half-life]] of about 50 minutes.  It is monitored by [[Partial thromboplastin time|PTT]].  Because of its hepatic metabolism, it may be used in patients with renal dysfunction.  (This is in contrast to [[lepirudin]], a direct thrombin inhibitor that is primarily renally cleared).

==Transitioning to warfarin in individuals with heparin induced thrombocytopenia==
Argatroban is used as an anticoagulant in individuals with thrombosis and heparin induced thrombocytopenia.  Often these individuals require long term anticoagulation.  If [[warfarin]] is chosen as the long term anticoagulant, this poses particular challenges due to the falsely elevated [[prothrombin time]] and [[international normalized ratio|INR]] caused by argatroban.  The combination of argatroban and warfarin may raise the INR to greater than 5.0 without a significant increased risk of bleeding complications.<ref name="refname1">{{cite journal | vauthors=Hursting MJ, Lewis BE, Macfarlane DE | title=Transitioning from argatroban to warfarin therapy in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. | journal=Clin Appl Thromb Hemost | year=2005 | volume=11 | issue=3 | pages=279–87 | pmid=16015413 | doi=10.1177/107602960501100306}}</ref> One solution to this problem is to measure the chromogenic factor X level. A level < 40-45% typically indicates that the INR will be therapeutic (2-3) when the argatroban is discontinued.
