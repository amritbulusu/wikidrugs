'''Acemetacin''' is a [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] (NSAID) used for the treatment of [[osteoarthritis]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], lower back pain, and relieving post-operative pain. It is manufactured by [[Merck KGaA]] under the tradename '''Emflex''', and is available in the UK and other countries as a prescription-only drug.<ref>{{drugs.com|international|acemetacin}}: Acemetacin.</ref>

== Medical uses ==
Acemetacin has proven effective in the treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, [[ankylosing spondylitis]], and other kinds of rheumathoid inflammation, as well as in post-operative and [[post-traumatic (disambiguation)|post-traumatic]] pain and attack of [[gout]].<ref name="AC" /><ref name="Dinnendahl" /> Application of a single dose of acemetacin for post-operative pain is not well supported by studies.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=19588437|pmc=4170991|year=2009|author1=Moore|first1=R. A.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|issue=3|pages=CD007589|last2=Derry|first2=S|last3=McQuay|first3=H. J.|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007589.pub2|title=Single dose oral acemetacin for acute postoperative pain in adults}}</ref>

== Contraindications ==
Contraindications are basically the same as with other NSAIDs: [[hypersensitivity]] reactions to NSAIDs in the past (typically asthma or skin reactions), [[gastrointestinal]] or [[Human brain|cerebral]] bleeding, [[peptic ulcer]], [[haematopoietic]] disorders ([[anaemia]], [[leukopenia]]), and during the third trimester of pregnancy.<ref name="AC" /><ref name="Emflex">{{Drugs.com|UK|emflex-capsules-spc-13486}} on Emflex.</ref>

== Adverse effects ==
Common side effects (in about 1–10% of patients) include gastrointestinal problems typical of NSAIDs, such as [[nausea]], diarrhoea, stomach pain, and peptic ulcer; central nervous effects like headache and dizziness; and skin reactions. Gastrointestinal tolerability is better than that of the related drug [[indometacin]]. Severe allergic reactions and haematopoietic disorders occur in fewer than 0.01% of patients.<ref name="AC" /><ref name="Dinnendahl" />

== Interactions ==
The following interactions, typical of NSAIDs, have been described:<ref name="AC" /><ref name="Dinnendahl" />
* other NSAIDs, [[corticosteroid]]s: increased frequency of side effects, especially peptic ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding
* [[diuretic]]s, [[ACE inhibitors]] and other antihypertensive drugs: reduced effectiveness of these drugs
* with ACE inhibitors or [[ciclosporin]], increased risk of kidney function disorders
* [[anticoagulant]]s such as [[warfarin]]: increased risk of bleeding
* increased [[blood plasma]] concentrations of [[digoxin]] and [[methotrexate]]
* decreased plasma concentrations of [[lithium (medication)|lithium]]

== Pharmacology ==
{{main article|Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug#Mechanism of action}}
Acemetacin acts as an inhibitor of [[cyclooxygenase]] (COX), producing the anti-inflammatory and [[analgetic]] (pain relieving) effects. In the body, it is partly metabolized to indometacin, which also acts as a COX inhibitor. The same mechanism is responsible for the [[antipyretic]] and [[Antiplatelet drug|antiplatelet]] effects, which are however not clinically used, as well as for the typical NSAID adverse effects.<ref name="AC">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2015|language=German}}</ref><ref name="Dinnendahl">{{cite book|title=Arzneistoff-Profile|editor1=Dinnendahl, V |editor2=Fricke, U |publisher=Govi Pharmazeutischer Verlag|location=Eschborn, Germany|date=2003|edition=18|volume=1|isbn=978-3-7741-9846-3|language=German}}</ref>

An advantage of acemetacin is that it reduces gastric damage as compared to indometacin, possibly because acemetacin has less effect on the increase of [[leukotriene B4]] synthesis and [[tumor necrosis factor]] (TNF) expression, leading to less induction of [[leukocyte]]-endothelial adherence.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=17876306|pmc=2078220|year=2007|author1=Chávez-Piña|first1=A.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
[[File:Acemetacin metabolism.svg|thumb|right|Metabolism of acemetacin. Cleaving of the glycolic acid ester (green) activates the substance to indometacin, cleaving of the methoxy ether or the 4-chlorobenzoate (orange) inactivate it.]]

The substance is quickly and almost completely absorbed from the gut. Highest blood plasma concentrations are reached after two hours. It is bound to [[plasma protein]]s to 80–90%. Concentrations in the [[synovial fluid]] and [[synovial membrane|membranes]], muscle and bone are higher than in the blood.<ref name="AC" />

Apart from the active [[metabolite]] indometacin, a number of inactive metabolites are found after application of acemetacin: the O-desmethyl-, des-4-chlorobenzoyl-, and O-desmethyl-des-4-chlorobenzoyl derivatives of both indometacin and acemetacin, as well as all of these substances' [[glucuronide]]s (mediated at least partly by the enzyme [[UGT2B7]]<ref>{{cite web|publisher=MediQ.ch|title=Acemetacin |url=https://www.mediq.ch/substances/acemetacin|subscription=yes|access-date=16 September 2016}}</ref>). [[Elimination half-life]] is 4.5±2.8 hours (in some individuals up to 16 hours) under [[steady state]] conditions. 40% are eliminated via the kidney, and 50% via the faeces.<ref name="AC" /><ref name="Dinnendahl" />

== Chemistry ==
Acemetacin is the [[glycolic acid]] [[ester]] of indometacin. It is a fine, slightly yellowish, crystalline powder that melts at {{convert|150 to 153|C|F}}. It is [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphic]], with four known anhydrous (water-free) and two [[monohydrate]] crystalline forms.<ref name="Dinnendahl" />

=== Brand names ===
Other brand names include ''Zadex'' (Hungary),  ''Rheutrop'' (Austria), ''Acemetadoc'', ''Acephlogont'', ''Azeat'', ''Rantudil'' (Germany, Hungary, Mexico, Portugal, Turkey), ''Gamespir'' (Greece), ''Oldan'', ''Reudol'' (Spain), ''Tilur'' (Switzerland), ''Ost-map'' (Egypt).
