'''Trenbolone''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]]), also known as '''trienolone''' or '''trienbolone''',<ref name="Nations1990">{{cite book|author=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|title=Residues of Some Veterinary Drugs in Animals and Foods: Monographs Prepared by the Thirty-Fourth Meeting of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives, Geneva, 30 January-8 February 1989|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BCw1OUlrT-QC&pg=PA88|year=1990|publisher=Food & Agriculture Org.|isbn=978-92-5-102933-6|pages=88–}}</ref><ref name="Llewellyn2011">{{cite book|author=William Llewellyn|title=Anabolics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=afKLA-6wW0oC&pg=PT546|year=2011|publisher=Molecular Nutrition Llc|isbn=978-0-9828280-1-4|pages=546–}}</ref> as well as '''19-nor-δ<sup>9,11</sup>-testosterone''', '''Δ<sup>9,11</sup>-nandrolone''', or '''estra-4,9,11-trien-17β-ol-3-one''', is an [[anabolic-androgenic steroid]] (AAS) of the [[19-nortestosterone]] group.

==Uses==

===Veterinary===
Trenbolone improves muscle mass, feed efficiency, and mineral absorption in cattle.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Side effects==
{{See also|Anabolic steroid#Adverse effects}}

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
It has both [[anabolic]] and [[androgenic]] effects.<ref name="Llewellyn2011" />  Once [[metabolized]], the drugs have the effect of increasing [[ammonium]] ion uptake by muscles, leading to an increase in the rate of [[protein synthesis]]. It may also have the secondary effects of stimulating appetite and decreasing the rate of [[catabolism]], as all [[anabolic steroids]] are believed to; however, catabolism likely increases significantly once the steroid is no longer taken.<ref>http://www.sportsci.org/encyc/anabster/anabster.html{{full citation needed|date=December 2012}}</ref>  At least one study in rats has shown trenbolone to cause gene expression of the [[androgen receptor]] at least as potent as [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT). This evidence tends to indicate trenbolone can cause an increase in male [[secondary sex characteristic]]s without the need to convert to DHT.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/toxsci/70.2.202 |title=In Vitro and in Vivo Effects of 17beta-Trenbolone: A Feedlot Effluent Contaminant |year=2002 |last1=Wilson |first1=V.

===Pharmacokinetics===
To increase its effective half-life, trenbolone is administered as a [[prodrug]] as an [[ester]] conjugate such as [[trenbolone acetate]], [[trenbolone enanthate]], or [[trenbolone hexahydrobenzylcarbonate]] (Parabolan). Plasma [[lipase]]s then cleave the ester group in the bloodstream leaving free trenbolone.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Trenbolone compounds have a binding affinity for the [[androgen receptor]] five times as high as that of [[testosterone]].<ref name="Llewellyn2011"/><ref>{{cite journal |first1=Tanveer |last1=Beg |first2=Yasir Hasan |last2=Siddique |first3=Mohammad |last3=Afzal |title=Chromosomal Damage Induced by Androgenic Anabolic Steroids, Stanozolol and Trenbolone, in Human Lymphocytes |journal=Advances in Environmental Biology |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=39–43 |year=2007 |url=http://www.aensiweb.com/aeb/2007/39-43.pdf}}</ref><ref name="Mascie-TaylorRosetta2011">{{cite book|author1=C.

===Pharmacodynamics===
Studies on metabolism are mixed, with some studies showing that it is metabolized by [[aromatase]] or [[5-alpha reductase|5α-reductase]] into [[estrogen]]ic compounds such as [[estradiol]], or into [[dihydrotestosterone]], respectively.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.steroids.2010.01.019 |title=Tissue selectivity and potential clinical applications of trenbolone (17β-hydroxyestra-4,9,11-trien-3-one): A potent anabolic steroid with reduced androgenic and estrogenic activity |year=2010 |last1=Yarrow |first1=Joshua F. |last2=McCoy |first2=Sean C. |last3=Borst |first3=Stephen E. |journal=Steroids |volume=75 |issue=6 |pages=377–89 |pmid=20138077}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=6361192 |year=1984 |last1=Gettys |first1=TW |last2=d'Occhio |first2=MJ |last3=Henricks |first3=DM |last4=Schanbacher |first4=BD |title=Suppression of LH secretion by oestradiol, dihydrotestosterone and trenbolone acetate in the acutely castrated bull |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=107–12 |journal=The Journal of endocrinology |doi=10.1677/joe.0.1000107}}</ref>

Trenbolone and 17-epitrenbolone are both excreted in urine as conjugates that can be hydrolyzed with beta-glucuronidase.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=8674183 |year=1996 |last1=Schänzer |first1=W |title=Metabolism of anabolic androgenic steroids |volume=42 |issue=7 |pages=1001–20 |journal=Clinical Chemistry}}</ref> This implies that trenbolone leaves the body as beta-[[glucuronide]]s or [[sulfate]]s.

==Society and culture==

===Regulation===
Some [[bodybuilder]]s and [[athlete]]s use trenbolone for its muscle-building and otherwise performance-enhancing effects.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Such use is illegal in the United States and many other countries.
