'''Phenazine''' is an [[organic compound]] with the formula (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>. It is a dibenzo [[annulation|annulated]] [[pyrazine]], and the parent substance of many [[dye]]stuffs, such as the [[toluylene red]], [[induline]]s, and [[safranine]]s (and the closely related eurhodines).<ref name=ull>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Horst Berneth|title=Azine Dyes|encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2012|publisher=Wiley-VCH|place=Weinheim|doi=10.1002/14356007.a03_213.pub3}}</ref> Phenazine [[crystal]]lizes in yellow needles, which are only sparingly soluble in [[alcohol]]. [[Sulfuric acid]] dissolves it, forming a deep-red solution.

==Synthesis==
Classically phenazine are prepared by the reaction of nitrobenzene and aniline in the [[Wohl-Aue reaction]]). Other methods include:
* pyrolysis of the [[barium]] [[salt]] of azobenzoate
* oxidation of [[aniline]] with [[lead oxide]]
* oxidation of dihydrophenazine, which is prepared by heating [[pyrocatechin]] with [[o-phenylenediamine]].
* oxidation of ortho-aminodiphenylamine with [[lead peroxide]].

==Derivatives==
* The more complex phenazines, such as the [[naphthophenazine]]s, [[naphthazine]]s, and [[naphthotolazine]]s, may be prepared by condensing [[Toluidine|ortho-diamine]]s with [[quinone|ortho-quinone]]s<ref>{{OrgSynth | author = Alexander R. Surrey | title = Pyocyanine | collvol = 3 | collvolpages = 753 | year = 1955 | prep = cv3p0753}}</ref> or by the [[oxidation]] of an ortho-diamine in the presence of α-[[naphthol]], and by the decomposition of ortho-anilido-(-toluidido- et cetera)- [[azo compound]]s with dilute [[acid]]s.
* If alkyl or aryl-ortho-diamines be used, [[azonium]] [[base (chemistry)|base]]s are obtained. The azines are mostly yellow in color, distill unchanged and are stable to [[oxidant]]s. They add on [[alkyl iodide]]s readily, forming alkyl azonium salts, [[anhydride]] formation also taking place between these [[hydroxyl]]groups. It dissolves in concentrated sulfuric acid with a yellowish-green [[fluorescence]].
* The [[rhodamine]]s, which are closely related to the phthaleins, are formed by the condensation of the [[alkyl]] metaaminophenols with [[phthalic anhydride]] in the presence of sulfuric acid. Their [[salt]]s are fine red dyes. By the entrance of [[amino]] or [[hydroxyl]] groups into the [[molecule]] dyestuffs are formed. The mono-amino derivatives or eurhodines are obtained when the arylmonamines are condensed with orthoamino azo compounds; by condensing quinone dichlorimide or para-nitrosodimethyl aniline with monamines containing a free para position, or by oxidizing ortho-hydroxydiaminodipbenylamines. They are yellowish-red solids, which behave as weak [[base (chemistry)|base]]s, their salts undergoing [[hydrolytic]] dissociation in [[aqueous solution]]. When heated with concentrated [[hydrochloric acid]] the amino group is replaced by the hydroxyl group and the [[phenol]]ic [[eurhodol]]s are produced.

===Aminophenazine===
[[Image:Neutral red.png|thumb|right|300px|Neutral red]]
Many aminophenazines are prominent dyes. Two of the first synthetic dyes are aminophenazines, these include [[induline]] and [[nigrosin]].<ref name=ull/>

The [[symmetrical]] diaminophenazine is the parent substance of the important dyestuff [[toluylene red]] (dimethyldiaminotoluphenazine). It is obtained by the oxidation of [[O-phenylenediamine|ortho-phenylenediamine]] with [[ferric chloride]].  

In a related process, oxidation of a cold mixture of [[Dimethyl-4-phenylenediamine|''para''-aminodimethylaniline]] and ''meta''-toluylenediamine gives toluylene blue.  This indamine is formed as an intermediate product and passing into the red when boiled; and also by the [[oxidation]] of dimethylparaphenylene diatnine with metatoluylene diamine. It crystallizes in orange-red needles and its alcoholic solution fluoresces strongly. It dyes [[silk]] and mordanted [[cotton]] a fine scarlet. It is known commercially as [[neutral red]]. For the phenazonium [[salt]]s, see [[safranine]]. [[Benzo(c)cinnoline|Benzo[c]cinnoline]] is an [[isomer]] of phenazine, to which it bears the same relation that [[phenanthrene]] bears to [[anthracene]].

==Natural products==
Many phenazine compounds are found in nature and are produced by bacteria such as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' spp., ''[[Streptomyces]]'' spp., and ''[[Pantoea agglomerans]]''. These phenazine [[natural products]] have been implicated in the virulence and competitive fitness of producing organisms. For example, the phenazine [[pyocyanin]] produced by ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' contributes to its ability to colonise the lungs of [[cystic fibrosis]] patients. Similarly, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid, produced by a number of Pseudomonas, increases survival in soil environments and has been shown to be essential for the [[Biological pest control|biological control]] activity of certain strains.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Turner, J.

==Biosynthesis==
Phenazine biosynthesis branches off the [[Shikimic acid|shikimic acid pathway]] at a point subsequent to [[chorismic acid]]. Two molecules of this chorismate-derived intermediate are then brought together in a diagonally-symmetrical fashion to form the basic phenazine scaffold. Sequential modifications then lead to a variety of phenazine with differing [[Biological activity|biological activities]].
