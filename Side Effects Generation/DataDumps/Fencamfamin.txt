'''Fencamfamin''' ([[International nonproprietary name|INN]]), also known as '''fencamfamine''' or by the brand names '''Glucoenergan''' and '''Reactivan''', is a [[stimulant]] which was developed by Merck in the 1960s.<ref>{{ cite patent | country = DE | status = patent | number = 1110159 | assign1 = Merck | title = Improvements in or relating to Amino-Norcamphane Compounds | gdate = 1961-07-06 }}</ref>

==Medical uses==
Fencamfamin is still used, though rarely, for treating depressive day-time fatigue, lack of concentration and lethargy, particularly in individuals who have chronic medical conditions, as its favourable safety profile makes it the most suitable drug in some cases.<ref name=reactivan>{{ cite web | url = http://home.intekom.com/pharm/merckp/reactivn.html | title = REACTIVAN Tablets; REACTIVAN Syrup | publisher = Merck }}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Fencamfamin is well tolerated and causes minimal circulatory effects. Extended use may result in a dryness of the mouth.<ref name=reactivan/>

===Contraindications===
Not to be used with heart diseases, angina pectoris and decompensated cardiac insufficiency, glaucoma, hyper-excitability and thyrotoxicosis or while treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors.<ref name=reactivan/>

===Overdose===
Symptoms of overdose are nausea, agitation and restlessness, dryness of the mouth, dizziness and tremor. In gross overdosage also associated with dyspnoea, tachycardia, disorientation and convulsions.<ref name=reactivan/>

==Research==
In a study on slices of rat corpus striatum and substantia nigra fencamfamin acted as an indirect [[dopamine agonist]]. It released [[dopamine]] by a similar mechanism to amphetamines, but was ten times less potent than dexamphetamine at producing this effect. The main mechanism of action was instead inhibition of dopamine [[reuptake]]. Also unlike [[amphetamine]]s, fencamfamin does not inhibit the action of [[monoamine oxidase]] enzymes. It was concluded that, at least in the models employed, the in vitro profile of fencamfamin is more similar to that of [[nomifensine]], a reportedly pure uptake inhibitor, than to d-amphetamine.<ref>{{Cite journal

In animal experiments on place preference fencamfamin produced a significant place preference only at the dose of 3.5&nbsp;mg/kg. The experiments suggested a relation to dopamine D1 receptors, and also to [[opioid]] receptors in the reinforcement produced by fencamfamin, as place preference was blocked by the selective dopamine D1 antagonist [[SCH 23390]] and by the opioid antagonist [[naloxone]].<ref>{{Cite journal

Animals treated with naloxone before the conditioning sessions showed a place aversion instead of the place preference found in saline-treated animals. Naloxone also reduced drinking. It was proposed that naloxone induced a state of frustrative nonreward. It was suggested that both dopamine and (endogenous) opioids are important for water-induced reinforcement. Possible interactions between these two neurotransmitter systems were discussed.<ref>{{Cite journal

==Synthesis==
[[File:Fencamfamine precursor synthesis.svg|thumb|center|600px|Preparation of fencamfamin precursor]]
Fencamfamin may be synthesized in a straightforward fashion via the [[Diels-Alder reaction]] between [[cyclopentadiene]] and [[Beta-Nitrostyrene|β-nitrostyrene]] (1-nitro-2-phenyl-ethene). The C=C double bond and the [[nitro compound|nitro-group]] in the resulting [[norcamphene]] derivative are then reduced to give the saturated [[norcamphane]] derivative. Finally, the [[amine|amino-group]] is ethylated.

Although β-nitrostyrene is commercially available, it is also very easily prepared using the [[Knoevenagel condensation]] between [[benzaldehyde]] and [[nitromethane]].<ref>{{ OrgSynth | author = Worrall, D. E. | title = Nitrostyrene | year = 1929 | volume = 9 | pages = 66 | collvol = 1 | collvolpages = 413 | prep = cv1p0413 | doi = 10.15227/orgsyn.009.0066 }}</ref>

The Diels-Alder reaction of [[Beta-Nitrostyrene|β-nitrostyrene]] and cyclopentadiene is described in a number of early papers.<ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Allen, C.

The reduction of the [[nitroalkene]] may be carried out sequentially. The [[alkene]]'s double bond is typically reduced using hydrogen and a [[transition metal]] [[catalyst]] like Ni or Pt, while the nitro group is reduced to the amine with a metal/acid combination, such as Fe/HCl.<ref name = Parham/> The reduction of both functional groups can also be achieved simultaneously by the use of [[Raney nickel]],<ref name = Parham/> and this transformation has recently been optimized by Russian chemists.<ref name = Novakov>{{ cite journal |author1=Novakov, I.

Originally achieved under [[reductive amination]] conditions involving the reaction of the amine with [[acetaldehyde]] in the presence of Pt, ethylation of the amino-group has been improved by the use of Ra-Ni and ethanol.<ref name = Novakov/>

The [[stereochemical]] consequences of the steps involved in the reaction sequence outlined above have been studied. Thus, the Diels-Alder [[cycloaddition]] leads to a product in which the nitro- and phenyl- groups are in a trans- relationship to each other.<ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Weinstock, J. |author2=Schwartz, N. |author3=Kormendy, M.
