==Medical use==
Hydroxychloroquine treats malaria, systemic [[lupus erythematosus]], rheumatic disorders like [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[porphyria cutanea tarda]], [[Q fever]].<ref name=AHFS2016/>

In 2014 its efficacy to treat Sjögren's syndrome was questioned in a double-blind study involving 120 patients over a 48-week period.<ref>Effects of Hydroxychloroquine on Symptomatic Improvement in Primary Sjögren Syndrome, Gottenberg, et al. (2014) http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleID=1887760</ref> 

Hydroxychloroquine is widely used in the treatment of post-Lyme [[arthritis]] following [[Lyme disease]]. It may have both an anti-[[spirochaete]] activity and an anti-inflammatory activity, similar to the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.<ref>{{cite journal | first1 = Steere | last1 = AC | first2 = Angelis | last2 = SM | title = Therapy for Lyme Arthritis: Strategies for the Treatment of Antibiotic-refractory Arthritis | journal = Arthritis and Rheumatism | volume = 54 | issue = 10 | pages = 3079–86 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 17009226 | doi = 10.1002/art.22131}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
The most common adverse effects are a mild [[nausea]] and occasional stomach cramps with mild [[diarrhea]]. The most serious adverse effects affect the eye.

For short-term treatment of acute malaria, adverse effects can include abdominal cramps, diarrhea, heart problems, reduced appetite, headache, nausea and [[vomiting]].

For prolonged treatment of lupus or arthritis, adverse effects include the acute symptoms, plus altered eye pigmentation, [[acne]], [[anemia]], bleaching of hair, blisters in mouth and eyes, blood disorders, convulsions, vision difficulties, diminished reflexes, emotional changes, excessive coloring of the skin, hearing loss, hives, itching, liver problems or [[liver failure]], [[Hair loss|loss of hair]], muscle paralysis, weakness or [[muscle atrophy|atrophy]], nightmares, [[psoriasis]], reading difficulties, [[tinnitus]], skin inflammation and scaling, skin rash, vertigo, [[weight loss]], and occasionally [[urinary incontinence]]. Hydroxychloroquine can worsen existing cases of both [[psoriasis]] and [[porphyria]].

===Eyes===
{{Main article|Chloroquine retinopathy}}
One of the most serious side effects is a toxicity in the eye (generally with chronic use).<ref name="pmid18427609">{{cite journal | last1 = Flach | first1 = AJ |title = Improving the Risk-benefit Relationship and Informed Consent for Patients Treated with Hydroxychloroquine | journal = Transactions of the American Ophthalmological Society | volume = 105 | pages = 191–4; discussion 195–7 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18427609 | pmc = 2258132}}</ref> People taking 400&nbsp;mg of hydroxychloroquine or less per day generally have a negligible risk of [[Macula of retina|macular]] toxicity, whereas the risk begins to go up when a person takes the medication over 5 years or has a cumulative dose of more than 1000&nbsp;grams. The daily safe maximum dose for eye toxicity can be computed from one's height and weight using this [http://www.eyedock.com/index.php?option=com_jumi&fileid=8&Itemid=73 calculator]. Cumulative doses can also be calculated from this calculator. Macular toxicity is related to the total cumulative dose rather than the daily dose. Regular eye screening, even in the absence of visual symptoms, is recommended to begin when either of these risk factors occurs.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Marmor | first1 = MF | last2 = Kellner | first2 = U | last3 = Lai | first3 = TYY | last4 = Lyons | first4 = JS | last5 = Mieler | first5 = WF | title = Revised Recommendations on Screening for Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine Retinopathy | journal = Ophthalmology | date = February 2011 | volume = 118 | issue = 2 | pages = 415–22 | doi = 10.1016/j.ophtha.2010.11.017 | pmid = 21292109 }}</ref>

Toxicity from hydroxychloroquine may be seen in two distinct areas of the eye: the [[cornea]] and the macula. The cornea may become affected (relatively commonly) by an innocuous [[cornea verticillata]] or vortex keratopathy and is characterized by whorl-like corneal epithelial deposits. These changes bear no relationship to dosage and are usually reversible on cessation of hydroxychloroquine.

The macular changes are potentially serious and are related to dosage and length of time taking hydroxychloroquine. Advanced retinopathy is characterized by reduction of visual acuity and a "bull's eye" macular lesion which is absent in early involvement.

==Interactions==
A type of [[enzyme]] deficiency ([[enzyme]] [[Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase|G6PD]]) found most frequently in those of [[Africa]]n descent can develop into severe [[anemia]] and requires monitoring.<ref name="urlHydroxychloroquine (Oral Route) - MayoClinic.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/drug-information/DR600761 |title=Hydroxychloroquine (Oral Route) - MayoClinic.com |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-10-30}}</ref> Children are more sensitive to hydroxychloroquine: small doses can be potentially fatal.

The drug transfers into [[breast milk]] and should be used with care by [[pregnant]] or nursing mothers.

Hydroxychloroquine generally does not have significant interactions with other medications, but care should be taken if combined with medication altering liver function as well as [[aurothioglucose]] (Solganal), [[cimetidine]] (Tagamet) or [[digoxin]] (Lanoxin). HCQ can increase plasma concentrations of [[penicillamine]] which may contribute to the development of severe side effects. It enhances [[Hypoglycemia|hypoglycemic]] effects of [[Insulin (medication)|insulin]] and [[Anti-diabetic medication|oral hypoglycemic agents]]. Dose altering is recommended to prevent profound [[hypoglycemia]]. [[Antacid]]s may decrease the absorption of HCQ. Both [[neostigmine]] and [[pyridostigmine]] antagonize the action of hydroxychloroquine.<ref>{{cite web|title=Russian Register of Medicines: Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine) Film-coated Tablets for Oral Use. Prescribing Information|url=http://www.rlsnet.ru/tn_index_id_2615.htm|publisher=Sanofi-Synthelabo|accessdate=14 July 2016|language=Russian}}</ref>

==Overdose==
Due to rapid absorption, symptoms of overdose can occur within a half an hour after ingestion. Overdose symptoms include convulsions, drowsiness, headache, heart problems or [[heart failure]], difficulty breathing and vision problems.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacokinetics===
Hydroxychloroquine has similar [[pharmacokinetics]] to [[chloroquine]], with rapid gastrointestinal absorption and elimination by the kidneys. [[Cytochrome P450]] enzymes ([[CYP2D6]], [[CYP2C8|2C8]], [[CYP3A4|3A4]] and [[CYP3A5|3A5]]) metabolize hydroxychloroquine to ''N''-desethylhydroxychloroquine.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Kalia | first1 = S | last2 = Dutz | first2 = JP | doi = 10.1111/j.1529-8019.2007.00131.x | title = New Concepts in Antimalarial Use and Mode of Action in Dermatology | journal = Dermatologic Therapy | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 160–74 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17970883}}</ref>

===Pharmacodynamics===
Antimalarials are [[Lipophilicity|lipophilic]] weak bases and easily pass [[Cell membrane|plasma membranes]]. The free base form accumulates in [[Lysosome|lysosomes]] (acidic cytoplasmic [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicles]]) and is then [[Protonation|protonated]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kaufmann | first1 = AM | last2 = Krise | first2 = JP | doi = 10.1002/jps.20792 | title = Lysosomal Sequestration of Amine-containing Drugs: Analysis and Therapeutic Implications | journal = Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences | volume = 96 | issue = 4 | pages = 729–46 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17117426}}</ref> resulting in concentrations within lysosomes up to 1000 times higher than in culture media.

The higher pH of these vesicles in macrophages or other antigen-presenting cells limits the association of autoantigenic (any) [[Peptide|peptides]] with [[MHC class II|class II MHC]] molecules in the compartment for peptide loading and/or the subsequent processing and transport of the peptide-MHC complex to the cell membrane.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Fox | first = R | title = Anti-malarial Drugs: Possible Mechanisms of Action in Autoimmune Disease and Prospects for Drug Development | journal = Lupus | year = 1996 | volume = 5 | pmid = 8803903 | pages = S4–10 | doi = 10.1177/096120339600500103 }}</ref> 

===Mechanism of action===
Hydroxychloroquine increases<ref>{{cite book | author = Waller | edition = 2nd | title = Medical Pharmacology and Therapeutics | page = 370 | display-authors = et al.}}</ref> lysosomal pH in [[Antigen-presenting cell|antigen-presenting cells]]. In inflammatory conditions, it blocks [[Toll-like receptor|toll-like receptors]] on [[plasmacytoid dendritic cell]]s (PDCs).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} [[TLR9|Toll-like receptor 9]] (TLR 9), which recognizes DNA-containing immune complexes, leads to the production of [[interferon]] and causes the [[dendritic cell]]s to mature and present [[antigen]] to [[T cell]]s. Hydroxychloroquine, by decreasing TLR signaling, reduces the activation of dendritic cells and the inflammatory process.

In 2003 a novel mechanism was described wherein hydroxychloroquine inhibits stimulation of the [[toll-like receptor]] (TLR) 9 family receptors. TLRs are cellular receptors for microbial products that induce inflammatory responses through activation of the [[innate immune system]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Takeda | first1 = K | last2 = Kaisho | first2 = T | last3 = Akira | first3 = S | title = Toll-Like Receptors | doi = 10.1146/annurev.immunol.21.120601.141126 | journal = Annual Review of Immunology | volume = 21 | pages = 335–76 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12524386}}</ref>

As with other [[quinoline]] antimalarial drugs, the mechanism of action of [[quinine]] <!-- What does quinine have to do with hydroxychloroquine? --> has not been fully resolved. The most accepted model is based on hydrochloroquinine and involves the inhibition of [[hemozoin]] [[biocrystallization]], which facilitates the aggregation of cytotoxic [[heme]]. Free cytotoxic heme accumulates in the parasites, causing their deaths.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}
