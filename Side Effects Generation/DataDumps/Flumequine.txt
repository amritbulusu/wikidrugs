==History==
The first quinolone used was nalidixic acid (was marketed in many countries as Negram) followed by the fluoroquinolone flumequine.<ref name="pharmacorama.com"/> The first-generation fluoroquinolone agents, such as flumequine, had poor distribution into the body tissues and limited activity.  As such they were used mainly for treatment of urinary tract infections. Flumequine (benzo quinolizine) was first patented in 1973, (German Patent) by Rikker Labs.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/rpc/rcn037 |title=Generics (UK) Ltd v Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co Ltd |year=2009 |journal=Reports of Patent, Design and Trade Mark Cases |volume=126 |page=102 |issue=2}}</ref>  Flumequine is a known antimicrobial compound described and claimed in U.S. Pat.

Though used frequently to treat farm animals and on occasion household pets, flumequine was also used to treat urinary tract infections in humans.  Flumequine, was used transiently treat urinary infections<ref name=pmid3356617/> until ocular toxicity was reported.<ref name=pmid6378414>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sirbat D, Saudax E, Hurault de Ligny B, Hachet E, Abellan P, George JL |title=[Serous macular detachment and treatment with flumequine (Apurone &#61; urinary antibacterial).

In 2008, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requested that all quinolone/fluoroquinolone drugs package inserts include a Black Boxed Warning concerning the risk of spontaneous tendon ruptures, which would have included flumequine.

==Drug residue==
The use of flumequine in food animals had sparked considerable debate.  Significant and harmful residues of quinolones have been found in animals treated with quinolones and later slaughtered and sold as food products.  There has been significant concern regarding the amount of flumequine residue found within food animals such as fish, poultry and cattle.<ref>{{cite conference |vauthors=Karbiwnyk CM, Hibbard LE, Lee RH |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/oc/scienceforum/sf2005/Search/preview.cfm?abstract_id=429&backto=category |title=Confirmation of Oxolinic Acid and Flumequine Residues in Shrimp by Liquid Chromatography with Tandem Mass Spectrometry Detection |date=April 27–28, 2005 |conference=FDA Science|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>Residue found in Catfish/Basa, Shrimp, salmon, trout

The role of JECFA is to evaluate toxicology, residue chemistry and related information and make recommendations for acceptable daily intake (ADI) levels and maximum residue limits (MRLs).  At its 16th session, held May 2006, the Committee on Residues of Veterinary Drugs in Foods (CCRVDF) requested information on registered uses of flumequine. As the CCRVDF did not receive any information regarding the registered uses of flumequine that they had requested, the committee members agreed to discontinue work on the MRLs for flumequine in shrimp.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/NewsEvents/FDAVeterinarianNewsletter/UCM055721.pdf |title=FDA Veterinarian Newsletter, Volume XXII, No. V, 2007 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-04-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/NewsEvents/FDAVeterinarianNewsletter/ucm109981.htm |title=Codex Committee on Veterinary Drug Residues Acts on Several Documents at 17th Session |publisher=Fda.gov |date=2009-10-28 |accessdate=2010-04-04}}</ref>

==Mode of action==
Ciprofloxacin is a [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]] that is active against both
[[Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative]] bacteria.  It functions by inhibiting [[DNA gyrase]], a type II [[topoisomerase]], and topoisomerase IV,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Drlica K, Zhao X |title=DNA gyrase, topoisomerase IV, and the 4-quinolones |journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=377–92 |date=September 1997 |pmid=9293187 |pmc=232616 |url=http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9293187}}</ref> enzymes necessary to separate bacterial DNA, thereby inhibiting cell division.

This mechanism can also affect mammalian cell replication. In particular, some congeners of this drug family (for example those that contain the C-8 fluorine),<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Robinson MJ, Martin BA, Gootz TD, McGuirk PR, Osheroff N |title=Effects of novel fluoroquinolones on the catalytic activities of eukaryotic topoisomerase II: Influence of the C-8 fluorine group |journal=[[Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy]] |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=751–6 |date=April 1992 |pmid=1323952 |pmc=189387 |url=http://aac.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=1323952 |doi=10.1128/aac.36.4.751}}</ref> display high activity not only against bacterial topoisomerases, but also against eukaryotic topoisomerases and are toxic to cultured mammalian cells and ''in vivo'' tumor models.<ref name="pmid14529452">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sissi C, Palumbo M |title=The quinolone family: from antibacterial to anticancer agents |journal=Current Medicinal Chemistry |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=439–50 |date=November 2003 |pmid=14529452 |doi=10.2174/1568011033482279 |quote=The present review focuses on the structural modifications responsible for the transformation of an antibacterial into an anticancer agent.

Although quinolones are highly toxic to mammalian cells in culture, its mechanism of cytotoxic action is not known. Quinolone induced DNA damage was first reported in 1986 (Hussy et al.).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hussy P, Maass G, Tümmler B, Grosse F, Schomburg U |title=Effect of 4-quinolones and novobiocin on calf thymus DNA polymerase alpha primase complex, topoisomerases I and II, and growth of mammalian lymphoblasts |journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=1073–8 |date=June 1986 |pmid=3015015 |pmc=180502 |url=http://aac.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=3015015 |doi=10.1128/AAC.29.6.1073}}</ref>

The molecular formula is C14H12FNO3 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://msds.chem.ox.ac.uk/FL/flumequine.html |title=Safety (MSDS) data for flumequine |publisher=Msds.chem.ox.ac.uk |date=2006-07-24 |accessdate=2010-04-04}}</ref>  It is a white powder, odorless, flavorless, insoluble in water but soluble in organic solvent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.88chem.com/product-Antibiotic-and-Antimicrobial-Agents/10132/Flumequine-antiniotic-antimicrobial-agents-.html |title=Flumequine(antiniotic antimicrobial agents) Manufacturers & Suppliers |publisher=88chem.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-04}}</ref>

==Pharmacokinetics ==
Flumequine is considered to be well absorbed and is excreted in the urine and feces as the glucuronide conjugates of the parent drug and 7-hydroxyflumequine. It is eliminated within 168 hours post-dosing.   However, studies concerning the calf liver showed additional unidentified residues, of which a new metabolite, ml, represented the major single metabolite 24 hours after the last dose and at all subsequent time points.  The metabolite ml, which exhibited no antimicrobial activity, was present in both free and protein-bound fractions. The major residue found in the edible tissues of sheep, pigs, and chickens was parent drug together with minor amounts of the 7-hydroxy-metabolite. The only detected residue in trout was the parent drug.<ref>Flumequine  First draft prepared by Philip G. Francis Russet House, Shere Road West Horsley, Surrey, England  and Dr. Robert J.
