'''Insulin degludec''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]/[[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]) is an ultralong-acting basal [[insulin analogue]] that was developed by [[Novo Nordisk]] under the brand name '''Tresiba'''.<ref name=CHMP2012/>  It is administered via [[subcutaneous injection]] once daily to help control the [[blood sugar]] level of those with [[diabetes]]. It has a duration of action that lasts up to 42 hours (compared to 18 to 26 hours provided by other marketed long-acting insulins such as [[insulin glargine]] and [[insulin detemir]]), making it a once-daily basal insulin,<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 17391154| year = 2007| author1 = Klein| first1 = O| title = Albumin-bound basal insulin analogues (insulin detemir and NN344): Comparable time-action profiles but less variability than insulin glargine in type 2 diabetes| journal = Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism| volume = 9| issue = 3| pages = 290–9| last2 = Lynge| first2 = J| last3 = Endahl| first3 = L| last4 = Damholt| first4 = B| last5 = Nosek| first5 = L| last6 = Heise| first6 = T| doi = 10.1111/j.1463-1326.2006.00685.x}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 25179915| pmc = 4156782| year = 2014| author1 = Haahr| first1 = H| title = A review of the pharmacological properties of insulin degludec and their clinical relevance| journal = Clinical Pharmacokinetics| volume = 53| issue = 9| pages = 787–800| last2 = Heise| first2 = T| doi = 10.1007/s40262-014-0165-y}}</ref><ref>European Medicines Agency: [http://ec.europa.eu/health/documents/community-register/2013/20130121124987/anx_124987_en.pdf Tresiba Summary of product characteristics]</ref> that is one that provides a base insulin level, as opposed to the fast and short acting bolus insulins.

Insulin degludec is a modified insulin that has one single amino acid deleted in comparison to human insulin, and is conjugated to hexadecanedioic acid via gamma-L-glutamyl spacer at the amino acid [[lysine]] at position B29.

==Side effects==
A significant side effect of insulin therapy is hypoglycemia.  A meta-analysis of clinical trials published in July 2012 found 39 to 47.9 events of hypoglycemia (defined as blood glucose <56&nbsp;mg/dL) per patient year, with higher rates in the more concentrated degludec formulation.  Rates of nocturnal hypoglycemia ranged from 3.7 to 5.1 events per patient year.<ref name="systematicrev"/>

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
Insulin degludec is an ultra-long acting insulin that, unlike [[insulin glargine]], is active at a physiologic pH.  The addition of hexadecanedioic acid to lysine at the B29 position allows for the formation of multi-hexamers in subcutaneous tissues.<ref name="Degludec review">{{cite journal|last=Nasrallah|first=SN|author2=Reynolds, LR |title=Insulin Degludec, The New Generation Basal Insulin or Just another Basal Insulin?|journal=Clinical medicine insights.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Insulin degludec has an onset of action of 30–90 minutes (similar to [[insulin glargine]] and [[insulin detemir]]).  There is no peak in activity, due to the slow release into systemic circulation.  The duration of action of insulin degludec is reported as being longer than 24 hours.<ref name="Degludec review" /><ref name=systematicrev>{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=F|author2=Surh, J |author3=Kaur, M |title=Insulin degludec as an ultralong-acting basal insulin once a day: a systematic review.|journal=Diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity : targets and therapy|year=2012|volume=5|pages=191–204|pmid=22826637|doi=10.2147/DMSO.S21979|pmc=3402007}}</ref>

==Effectiveness profile==
Studies have shown that patients taking insulin degludec needed to take significantly smaller doses of [[basal rate|basal insulin]] than those taking insulin glargine U100, while achieving similar blood glucose levels.  Insulin degludec also has the ability to be mixed with other insulins, thereby improving [[glycemic control]]. This cannot be done using current long-acting insulins.<ref name=monograph>{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/druginfo/monograph?cid=med&drugid=20805&drugname=Insulin+Glargine+SubQ&monotype=monograph&secid=3|title=Monograph - Insulin Glargine: Dosage & Administration|work=American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Inc.|accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref><ref name=reuters>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE65P0DB20100626|work=[[Reuters]]|author=Ringstrom, Anna|title=Novo says degludec has potential to lower blood sugar|accessdate=2010-11-07|date=2010-06-26}}</ref> A physician involved in the trials was quoted as saying,

==Clinical trial data==

===Type 1 diabetes mellitus===
Insulin degludec was studied as an alternative to insulin glargine as part of a basal-bolus regimen in the BEGIN Basal-Bolus Type 1 trial.  629 patients with [[type 1 diabetes]] were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to either insulin degludec (n=472) or insulin glargine (n=157) in addition to mealtime insulin aspart.  Patients in the degludec treatment arm were switched from their basal insulin to insulin degludec in a 1:1 ratio, with a 20-30% dose reduction in patients receiving multiple basal doses per day.  After 52 weeks, patients treated with insulin degludec produced a similar reduction in [[HbA1c]] (0.40% vs. 0.39%) meeting the criteria for noninferiority.  Adverse events were similar in the two treatment arms; however, rates of nocturnal [[hypoglycemia]] (between midnight and 6am) were 27% lower in patients treated with insulin degludec (3.91 vs. 5.22%,p=0.024).  The reduction in the incidence of hypoglycemia was seen as a therapeutic benefit, as hypoglycemia is often a dose limiting toxicity in insulin therapy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Heller|first=S |author2=Buse, J |author3=Fisher, M |author4=Garg, S |author5=Marre, M |author6=Merker, L |author7=Renard, E |author8=Russell-Jones, D |author9=Philotheou, A |author10=Francisco, AM |author11=Pei, H |author12=Bode, B |author13=BEGIN Basal-Bolus Type 1 Trial Investigators |title=Insulin degludec, an ultra-longacting basal insulin, versus insulin glargine in basal-bolus treatment with mealtime insulin aspart in type 1 diabetes (BEGIN Basal-Bolus Type 1): a phase 3, randomised, open-label, treat-to-target non-inferiority trial.|journal=Lancet|date=Apr 21, 2012|volume=379|issue=9825|pages=1489–97|pmid=22521071|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60204-9}}</ref>

===Type 2 diabetes mellitus===
In the BEGIN Basal-Bolus Type 2 trial, insulin degludec was studied as an alternative to insulin glargine in patients with [[type 2 diabetes mellitus]]. 995 patients were randomized to receive either insulin degludec (n=755) or insulin glargine (n=251), in addition to either mealtime insulin aspart, [[metformin]], and/or [[pioglitazone]].  Patients in this trial had an average HbA1c of 8.3–8.4%, and 49–50% were on a regimen consisting of basal-bolus insulin plus oral antidiabetic medications.  After 52 weeks, insulin degludec was found to be noninferior to insulin glargine, providing a similar HbA1c lowering effect (−1.10 vs. −1.18%).  Overall rates of hypoglycemia were significantly lower with insulin degludec (11.09 vs. 13.63%/yr, p=0.0359), including cases of nocturnal hypoglycemia (1.39 vs. 1.84%/yr, p=0.0399).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Garber|first=AJ |author2=King, AB |author3=Del Prato, S |author4=Sreenan, S |author5=Balci, MK |author6=Muñoz-Torres, M |author7=Rosenstock, J |author8=Endahl, LA |author9=Francisco, AM |author10=Hollander, P |author11=NN1250-3582 (BEGIN BB T2D) Trial Investigators |title=Insulin degludec, an ultra-longacting basal insulin, versus insulin glargine in basal-bolus treatment with mealtime insulin aspart in type 2 diabetes (BEGIN Basal-Bolus Type 2): a phase 3, randomised, open-label, treat-to-target non-inferiority trial |journal=The Lancet|date=April 21, 2012|volume=379|issue=9825|pages=1498–507|pmid=22521072|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60205-0}}</ref>
