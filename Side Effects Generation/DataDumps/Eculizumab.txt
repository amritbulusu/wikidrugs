Women should not become pregnant while taking eculizumab and pregnant women should not take it.<ref name=UKlabel2017/>

== Adverse effects ==
Eculizumab carries a [[black box warning]] for the risk of [[meningococcal infections]] and can only be prescribed by doctors who have enrolled in and follow a [[risk evaluation and mitigation strategy]] required by the FDA, which involves doctors counseling people to whom they are prescribing the drug, giving them educational materials, and ensuring that they are vaccinated, all of which must be documented.<ref name=USlabel2017/><ref name=UKlabel2017/>

Eculizumab inhibits terminal complement activation and therefore makes people vulnerable to infection with encapsulated organisms.

The drug's labels also carry warnings of severe [[anemia]] arising from the destruction of [[red blood cells]] as well as severe cases of [[Thrombotic microangiopathy|blood clots forming in small blood vessels]].<ref name=USlabel2017/><ref name=UKlabel2017/>

Headaches are very common adverse effects, occurring in more than 10% of people who take the drug.<ref name=UKlabel2017/>

Common adverse effects (occurring in between 1% and 10% of people who take the drug) include infections (pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infection, colds, and urinary tract infection), [[leukopenia|loss of white blood cells]], [[anemia|loss of red blood cells]], [[anaphylactic reaction]], [[hypersensitivity reaction]], loss of appetite, mood changes like depression and anxiety, a sense of tingling or numbness, blurred vision, vertigo, ringing in the ears, [[heart palpitations]], high blood pressure, low blood pressure, vascular damage, [[peritonitis]], constipation, upset stomach, swollen belly, itchy skin, increased sweating, [[Petechia|blotches from small bleeds under the skin]] and [[Erythema|skin redness]], [[Urticaria|hives]], muscle spasms, bone pain, back pain, neck pain, swollen joints, kidney damage, painful urination, spontaneous erections, general [[edema]], chest pain, weakness, pain at the infusion site, and [[elevated transaminases]].<ref name=UKlabel2017/>

== Pharmacology ==
Eculizumab specifically binds to the terminal [[complement component 5]], or C5, which acts at a late stage in the complement cascade.<ref name=UKlabel2017/> When activated, C5 is involved in activating host cells, thereby attracting pro-inflammatory immune cells, while also destroying cells by triggering pore formation. By inhibiting the complement cascade at this point, the normal, disease-preventing functions of proximal complement system are largely preserved, while the properties of C5 that promote inflammation and cell destruction are impeded.<ref name="Brodsky2009">{{cite journal|last1=Brodsky|first1=RA|title=Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria|journal=Hematology: Basic Principles and Practice|year=2009|pages=385–395|author2=Hoffman R, Benz EJ Jr, Shattil S|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Philadelphia, PA|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

Eculizumab inhibits the cleavage of C5 by the [[C5 convertase]] into [[Complement component 5a|C5a]] a potent anaphylatoxin with prothrombotic and proinflammatory properties, and C5b, which then forms the terminal complement complex C5b-9 which also has prothrombotic and proinflammatory effects. Both C5a and C5b-9 cause the complement-mediated events that are characteristic of PNH and aHUS.<ref name="Brodsky2009" />

The metabolism of eculizumab is thought to occur via [[lysosomal]] [[enzymes]] that cleave the [[antibody]] to generate small peptides and amino acids. The [[volume of distribution]] of eculizumab in humans approximates that of [[Blood plasma|plasma]].<ref name="Dmytrijuk2008" />

===Regulatory approval, orphan drug status===
Eculizumab was approved by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in March 2007 for the treatment of PNH,<ref name="Dmytrijuk2008" />Eculizumab has exclusivity rights until 2017, which protects it from competition until 2017.<ref name="Biosimilar_2013" />{{rp|6}}

=== Price ===
As of 2014 there was insufficient evidence to show that eculizumab therapy improves [[life expectancy]] for people with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and the cost-effectiveness was poor.<ref name="pmid24990825">{{cite journal |vauthors=Coyle D, Cheung MC, Evans GA |title=Opportunity Cost of Funding Drugs for Rare Diseases: The Cost-Effectiveness of Eculizumab in Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria |journal=Med Decis Making |volume= 34|issue= |pages= 1016–29| date=July 2014 |pmid=24990825 |doi=10.1177/0272989X14539731 |url=}}</ref>

Alexion started selling Soliris in 2008, making $295 million in 2007 with its stock price rising to 130% in 2010.<ref name="Gallant_2014" /> 

Sachdev Sidhu, a drug developer at the University of Toronto, estimated that public science was responsible for well over 80% of the work. "Public resources went into understanding the molecular basis of the disease, public resources went into the technology to make antibodies and finally, Alexion, to their credit, kind of picked up the pieces." The cost of manufacturing Soliris' monoclonal antibodies is less than "1 percent of the price of the drug," he said.<ref name="CBC_Crowe_2015" />

In December 2013, New Zealand's government pharmaceutical buyer [[Pharmaceutical Management Agency|Pharmac]] declined a proposal to subsidize the drug  after Alexion refused to budge on a NZ$670,000 (US$ 590,000) per person per year price and Pharmac's economic analysis determined the price would need to be halved before the drug was cost-effective enough to subsidize.<ref name="Pharmac">{{cite news |url= http://www.pharmac.health.nz/news/media-2013-12-11-eculizumab/ |title= Citing unreasonable price, PHARMAC declines eculizumab funding proposal |publisher= Pharmaceutical Management Agency |date= 11 December 2013 |accessdate= 22 June 2014}}</ref> Pharmac's decision upset many people with PNH in New Zealand PNH,<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Plea-to-Pharmac-for-pricey-life-saver/tabid/423/articleID/284198/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ | title= Plea to Pharmac for pricey life-saver| date=January 24, 2013}}</ref> although Pharmac has not ruled out reviewing the decision at a later date, should the drug be made available at a lower price.<ref name="Pharmac" />

According to a 2014 report, the orphan drug market has become increasingly lucrative for a number of reasons. The cost of clinical trials for orphan drugs is substantially lower than for other diseases —trial sizes are naturally much smaller than for more common diseases that affect more people. Small clinical trials and little competition place these orphan agents at an advantage when they come up for regulatory review.<ref name="EvaluatePharma_2014">{{citation |url=http://info.evaluategroup.com/rs/evaluatepharmaltd/images/2014OD.pdf |first=Andreas |last=Hadjivasiliou|title=Orphan Drug Report 2014 |date=October 2014 |work=EvaluatePharma |accessdate=28 June 2015}}</ref>
Further reduction to the cost of development is because of the tax incentives in the [[Orphan Drug Act of 1983]]. On average the cost per person for orphan drugs is "six times that of non-orphan drugs, a clear indication of their pricing power".<ref name="EvaluatePharma_2014">{{citation |url=http://info.evaluategroup.com/rs/evaluatepharmaltd/images/2014OD.pdf |first=Andreas |last=Hadjivasiliou|title=Orphan Drug Report 2014 |date=October 2014 |work=EvaluatePharma |accessdate=28 June 2015}}</ref> Although there are much smaller orphan disease populations, the cost of per-person outlays are the largest and are expected to increase with wider use of public subsidies.<ref name="EvaluatePharma_2014" />

In December 2014, the provincial government of [[Government of Ontario|Ontario]], [[Canada]] negotiated the price with the manufacturer of Soliris, the only drug approved by Health Canada to treat aHUS. People can apply for it on "compassionate grounds" "on a case-by-case basis for example individuals who have been urgently hospitalized due to an immediate life-, limb-, or organ-threatening complication." Soliris then was already "funded by the Ontario government for the treatment of another rare illness, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), through a bulk-buy deal reached by the provincial premiers in 2011."<ref name="Gallant_2014"/>

In February 2015, Canada’s drug-price regulator took the rare step of calling a hearing into Soliris, accusing Alexion of exceeding the permissible price cap under the ""Highest International Price Comparison"" (HIPC).<ref name="Blackwell_2015">{{citation |title=World’s most expensive drug — which costs up to $700,000 per year — too expensive, Canada says |first=Tom |last=Blackwell |date= February 3, 2015 |accessdate=June 25, 2015 |work=National Post |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/health/worlds-most-expensive-drug-prescription-that-costs-up-to-700000-per-year-too-expensive-canada-says}}</ref> In June 2015, the [[Patented Medicine Prices Review Board]] (PMPRB) under the [[Canadian Patent Act]], held a preliminary hearing in Ottawa, Ontario to examine allegations.

In Canada "provincial drug plans have already negotiated secret discounts on Soliris for many of the patients they cover."<ref name="Blackwell_2015" />

As of 2015, while Eculizumab in PNH was associated with 1.13 additional life years and 2.45 quality of life years QALYs, there has been a high incremental cost (CAN$5.24 million) and a substantial opportunity cost. A 2014 Canadian study calculated the cost per life-year-gained with treatment as CAN$4.62 million (US $4571564) and cost per quality-adjusted-life-year as CAN$2.13 million(US$ 2,112,398)."The incremental cost per life year and per QALY gained is CAN$4.62 million and CAN$2.13 million, respectively.

By 2015, industry analysts and academic researchers agreed, that the sky-high price of orphan drugs, such as eculizumab, was not related to research, development and manufacturing costs; their price is arbitrary and they have become more profitable than traditional medicines.<ref name="CBC_Crowe_2015" /> Sachdev Sidhu, a [[University of Toronto]] scientist who spent ten years at [[Genentech]] before coming to academia, claimed that 80 or 90 per cent of Soliris research and development was done by publicly funded university researchers working in academic laboratories.<ref name="CBC_Crowe_2015">{{citation |title=How pharmaceutical company Alexion set the price of the world's most expensive drug: Cost of one of world's most expensive drugs shrouded in corporate secrecy |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/how-pharmaceutical-company-alexion-set-the-price-of-the-world-s-most-expensive-drug-1.3125251 |first=Kelly |last=Crowe |work=CBC News |date=25 June 2015 |accessdate=25 June 2015}}</ref>
