'''Veliparib''' ('''ABT-888''')<ref>[http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/13/9/2728.full "ABT-888, an Orally Active Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase Inhibitor that Potentiates DNA-Damaging Agents in Preclinical Tumor Models"] May 2007</ref> is a potential anti-cancer drug acting as a [[PARP inhibitor]]. It kills cancer cells by blocking a protein called PARP, thereby preventing the repair of DNA or genetic damage in cancer cells and possibly making them more susceptible to anticancer treatments. Veliparib may make whole brain radiation treatment work more effectively against brain metastases from NSCLC. It has been shown to potentiate the effects of many chemotherapeutics, and as such has been part of many combination clinical trials.<ref name=adis/>

It inhibits both [[PARP1]] and [[PARP2]].<ref>http://www.cancer.gov/drugdictionary/?CdrID=496464</ref><ref>[http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/13/9/2728.abstract "ABT-888, an Orally Active Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase Inhibitor that Potentiates DNA-Damaging Agents in Preclinical Tumor Models"], 2007</ref>

== Development ==
Veliparib is being developed by [[AbbVie]]. It was derived from a prior lead compound (A 620223). The FDA awarded [[orphan drug status]] in November 2016 for NSCLC.<ref name=adis>[http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800028802 Veliparib drug profile]</ref>

===Clinical trials===
As of 2017, 96 clinical trials involving veliparib had been registered with the FDA.<ref>https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=veliparib</ref> It was included in the [[I-SPY2]] [[breast cancer]] trial.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1612347120100317 "Breast cancer study aims to speed drugs, cooperation"], March 2010</ref>

Numerous phase I [[clinical trial]]s are in progress.<ref>http://clinicaltrialsfeeds.org/clinical-trials/results/term=Drug:+ABT-888</ref>
Over 40 phase II clinical trials have been registered, for indications such as metastatic melanoma,<ref>[http://clinicaltrialsfeeds.org/clinical-trials/show/NCT00804908 "A Study Evaluating Efficacy of ABT-888 in Combination With Temozolomide in Metastatic Melanoma"]</ref> breast cancer,<ref>[http://clinicaltrialsfeeds.org/clinical-trials/show/NCT01009788 "ABT-888 and Temozolomide for Metastatic Breast Cancer"]</ref> NSCLC, prostate cancer<ref>[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01576172 Abiraterone Acetate and Prednisone With or Without Veliparib in Treating Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer]</ref> and brain tumors associated with metastatic primary tumors.

Combination trials have evaluated velibarib in combination with [[doxorubicin]], [[temozolomide]], [[topotecan]], [[carboplatin]], [[paclitaxel]], [[pemetrexed]], [[cyclophosphamide]], [[gemcitabine]], and others.<ref>https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=veliparib</ref>

By June 2014 it was in three phase III trials, for advanced ovarian cancer, [[triple-negative breast cancer]] and in [[non-small cell lung cancer]] (NSCLC).<ref>[http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/abbvie_takes_parp_inhibitor_into_third_phase_iii_trial_581059 AbbVie takes PARP inhibitor into third phase III trial. June 2014]</ref>
