'''Nisoxetine''', originally synthesized in the [[Eli Lilly and Company|Lilly]] research laboratories during the early 1970s, is a potent and selective inhibitor for the reuptake of [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline) into [[synapse]]s.

==History==
In treating depression, it was theorized that substances that could enhance norepinephrine transmission, such as [[tricyclic antidepressants]] (TCA), could diminish the symptoms of clinical depression.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bauer|first=Maxine|author2=Tejani-Butt, S.M. |title=Effects of repeated administration of desipramine or electroconvulsive shock on NE uptakes sites measured by <nowiki>[3H]</nowiki>nisoxetine autoradiography|journal=Brain Research|date=June 1992|volume=582|issue=2|pages=208–214|pmid=1327403|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000689939290134U|doi=10.1016/0006-8993(92)90134-U}}</ref> The origins of nisoxetine can be found within the discovery of [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac, by Eli Lilly). In the 1970s, Bryan B. Molloy (a medicinal chemist) and Robert Rathbun (a pharmacologist) began a collaboration to search for potential antidepressant agents that would still retain the therapeutic activity of TCAs without undesirable cardiotoxicity and anticholingergic properties.<ref name=WongOld>{{cite journal|last=Wong|first=David|author2=Bymaster, F.P. |author3=Engelman, E.A |title=Prozac (fluoxetine, lilly 110140), the first selective serotonin uptake inhibitor and an antidepressant drug: Twenty years since its first publication|journal=Life Sciences|date=June 1995|volume=57|issue=5|pages=411–441|pmid=7623609|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002432059500209O|doi=10.1016/0024-3205(95)00209-O}}</ref><ref name=WongNew>{{cite journal|last=Wong|first=David|author2=Kenneth, W.P. |author3=Bymaster, F.P. |title=The discovery of fluoxetine hydrochloride (Prozac)|journal=Nature Reviews Drug Discovery|date=September 2005|volume=4|pages=764–774|doi=10.1038/nrd1821|url=http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v4/n9/abs/nrd1821.html|issue=12|pmid=16121130}}</ref> The antihistamine drug [[diphenhydramine]] was found to inhibit [[monoamine]] uptake in addition to antagonizing histamine receptors, and this inhibition of monoamine uptake became a potential application for treating depression.<ref name=WongOld/><ref name=WongNew/> As a result, Molloy, along with colleagues Schmiegal and Hauser, synthesized members of the phenoxyphenylpropylamine (PPA) group as analogues of diphenhydramine.<ref name=WongOld/><ref name=WongNew/>

Preclinical studies in humans were also performed in 1976 to evaluate the safety and possible mechanism of nisoxetine.<ref name=Lemb>{{cite journal|last=Lemberger|first=L|author2=Terman, S. |author3=Rowe, H. |author4=Billings, R |title=The effect of nisoxetine (Lilly compound 94939), a potential antidepressant on biogenic amine uptake in man|journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology|date=April 1976|volume=3|issue=2|pmid=788744|pmc=1428886|pages=215–20|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.1976.tb00595.x}}</ref> At doses capable of blocking the uptake of norepinephrine and [[tyramine]] at nerve terminals, nisoxetine did not produce any substantial side effects.<ref name=Lemb/> Abnormal [[electrocardiogram]] effects were also not observed, indicating it to be a relatively safe compound.<ref name=Lemb/>

==Research==

===Obesity===
Numerous evidence suggests that by altering catecholaminergic signaling (cell communication via norepinephrine and dopamine), food intake and body weight will be affected via classic [[hypothalamic]] systems that are involved in the regulation of energy balance.<ref name=Billes/> Antidepressants, such as the atypical antidepressant [[bupropion]], can also cause weight loss due to their ability to increase extracellular dopamine and norepinephrine by inhibiting their uptake.<ref name=Billes/> Other research has focused on the interaction of serotonin and norepinephrine, leading to [[serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s (SNRIs) as anti-obesity drugs.<ref name=Billes/>

The primary forebrain sensor of peripheral cues that relays information about the availability of energy and storage is the [[arcuate nucleus]] of the [[hypothalamus]] (ARH), and it contains two types of cells that have opposing effects on energy balance.<ref name=Billes/> These two types of cells are [[neuropeptide Y]] (NPY)-expressing cells, which cause hyperphagia and energy conservation, and cells that [[pro-opiomelanocortin]] (POMC), which are related to hypophagia and increased energy expenditure.<ref name=Billes/> NPY and norepinephrine are both localized in select neurons in the brain and periphery.<ref name=Billes/> A norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, such as nisoxetine, could potentially cause anorexia by decreasing activity of cells that express NPY and norepinephrine.<ref name=Billes/>

In lean and obese mice, selective and combined norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibition reduces food intake and body weight. Yet selective reuptake inhibitors of norepinephrine and dopamine (nisoxetine and a substance codenamed GBR12783, respectively) independently have no effect on food intake in mice.<ref name=Billes/> However, when given in combination, there is profound inhibition of food intake.<ref name=Billes/> This demonstrates a synergistic interaction between dopamine and norepinephrine in controlling ingestive behavior, similar to the action of SNRIs.<ref name=Billes/> The fact that nisoxetine alone does not affect food intake suggests that norepinephrine alone is insufficient to affect feeding or that the blocked reuptake of norepinephrine by nisoxetine is acting in the wrong place.<ref name=Bray>{{cite journal|last=Bray|first=George|author2=Greenway, F.L. |title=Current and potential drugs for treatment of obesity|journal=Endocrine Reviews|date=December 1999|volume=20|issue=6|pages=805–875|doi=10.1210/er.20.6.805|url=http://edrv.endojournals.org/content/20/6/805.full|pmid=10605627}}</ref> Unlike nisoxetine, its sulfur analog thionisoxetine reduces food consumption in rodents and is a more promising treatment for obesity and eating disorders.<ref name=MedChem/>

===Analgesia effects===
An essential activity of [[local anesthetic]]s is the blockade of sodium channels.<ref name=ChenAnalgesia/> In this way, local anesthetics are able to produce infiltrative cutaneous analgesia, peripheral neural blockades, as well as spinal/epidural anesthesia.<ref name=ChenAnalgesia/> Due to nisoxetine’s sodium channel blocking effect, it is also possible that it may also have a local anesthetic effect.<ref name=ChenAnalgesia/> Nisoxetine is able to suppress the nicotine-evoked increase of hippocampal norepinephrine in a dose-dependent nature through effects on the functioning of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.<ref name=ChenAnalgesia/> It is also able to inhibit [[tetradotoxin]]-facilitated sensitive inward sodium currents in rat [[superior cervical ganglia]].<ref name=ChenAnalgesia/>

Nisoxetine elicits local (cutaneous) but not systemic analgesia.<ref name=ChenAnalgesia/> Compared to [[lidocaine]], a common anesthetic, nisoxetine is more potent (by four folds) and exhibits longer drug action towards producing cutaneous anesthesia.<ref name=ChenAnalgesia/> NMDA receptors are not involved in this local anesthetic effect.<ref name=ChenAnalgesia/> However, it is unclear whether nisoxetine may cause toxicity to the neuronal or subcutaneous tissues, which still needs to be investigated in the future.<ref name=ChenAnalgesia/>

===<sup>3</sup>H-nisoxetine===
Due to shortcomings of the previously available radioligands for the norepinephrine uptake site, researchers needed to find a better ligand for measuring norepinephrine reuptake sites.<ref name=Tej3HNis/> These shortcomings also meant that the norepinephrine uptake sites in the brain were less studied than the 5-HT uptake sites.<ref name=Tej3HNis/> Previous radioligands for the norepinephrine uptake sites, <sup>3</sup>H-desipramine (<sup>3</sup>H-DMI) and <sup>3</sup>H-[[mazindol]] (<sup>3</sup>H-MA), did not have specific and selective binding properties for norepinephrine sites.<ref name=Tej3HNis/>

<sup>3</sup>H-nisoxetine (<sup>3</sup>H-NIS), on the other hand, is a potent and selective inhibitor for the uptake of norepinephrine<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wong|first=David|author2=Threlkeld, P.G. |author3=Best, K.L. |author4=Bymaster, F.P. |title=A new inhibitor of norepinephrine uptake devoid of affinity for receptors in rat brain|journal=The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics|date=July 1982|volume=222|issue=1|pages=61–65|pmid=6123593|url=http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/222/1/61.abstract}}</ref> and is now used as a selective marker of the norepinephrine transporter.<ref name=Pubill>{{cite journal|last=Pubill|first=D|author2=Gasulla, D. |author3=Sureda, F.X. |author4=Camins, A. |author5=Pallas, M. |author6=Escubedo, E. |author7=Camarasa, J. |title=Characterization of <nowiki>[3H]</nowiki>nisoxetine binding in rat vas deferens membranes: Modulation by sigma and PCP ligands|journal=Life Sciences|date=January 1998|volume=62|issue=8|pages=763–773|pmid=9489512|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320597011740|doi=10.1016/S0024-3205(97)01174-0}}</ref> Most studies using <sup>3</sup>H-NIS are conducted in the rat model, and not many have been performed in humans.<ref name=JaySodium /> <sup>3</sup>H-NIS can be used to map anatomical sites associated with norepinephrine uptake through the technique of quantitative autoradiography (QAR), where the pattern of <sup>3</sup>H-NIS binding is consistent with the pattern of norepinephrine activation.<ref name=TejLC>{{cite journal|last=Tejani-Butt|first=S|author2=Ordway, G.A. |title=Effect of age on <sup>3</sup>H-nisoxetine binding to uptake sites for norepinephrine in the locus coeruleus of humans|journal=Brain Research|date=June 1992|volume=583|issue=1–2|pages=312–5|pmid=1504838|doi=10.1016/S0006-8993(10)80041-1}}</ref> Lesion studies also confirm <sup>3</sup>H-NIS's relation to presynaptic norepinephrine terminals.<ref name=TejLC/>

<sup>3</sup>H-NIS binds with high affinity ([[Dissociation constant|K<sub>d</sub>]] = 0.7 [[Molar concentration|nM]]) and selectivity to a homogenous population of sites that are associated with norepinephrine uptake in the rat brain.<ref name=Tej3HNis/> Specific <sup>3</sup>H-NIS binding increases as sodium concentration is raised, and binding of <sup>3</sup>H-NIS is barely detectable in the absence of sodium.<ref name=Tej3HNis/> Binding of <sup>3</sup>H-NIS is sodium-dependent because sodium ions are necessary for the neuronal uptake of norepinephrine.<ref name=Tej3HNis/> This binding is also heat-sensitive, where heating rat cerebral cortical membranes reduces the amount of specific binding.<ref name=Tej3HNis/> Nisoxetine (K<sub>i</sub> = 0.7 + 0.02 nM), as well as other compounds that have a high affinity for norepinephrine uptake sites (DMI, MAZ, maprotiline), act as potent inhibitors of <sup>3</sup>H-NIS binding to rat cortical membranes.<ref name=Tej3HNis/>

In humans, <sup>3</sup>H-NIS is used to measure uptake sites in the [[locus coeruleus]] (LC). The LC, a source of norepinephrine axons, has been of focus in research due to reports of cell loss in the area that occurs with aging in humans.<ref name=SamLC>{{cite journal|last=Samuels|first=E.R.|author2=Szabadi, E. |title=Functional neuroanatomy of the noradrenergic locus coeruleus: Its roles in the regulation of arousal and autonomic function part II: Physiological and pharmacological manipulations and pathological alterations of locus coeruleus activity in humans|journal=Current Neuropharmacology|date=September 2008|volume=6|issue=3|pages=254–85|doi=10.2174/157015908785777193|pmid=19506724|pmc=2687931}}</ref> Decreased binding of <sup>3</sup>H-NIS reflects the loss of LC cells.<ref name=SamLC/>

===NET imaging using PET===
Researchers are attempting to image the norepinephrine transporter (NET) system using [[positron emission tomography]] (PET). Possible ligands to be used for this methodology must possess high affinity and selectivity, high brain penetration, appropriate lipophilicity, reasonable stability in plasma, as well as high plasma free fraction.<ref name=DingPet>{{cite journal|last=Ding|first=Yu-Shin|author2=Lin, K. |author3=Logan, J. |author4=Benveniste, H. |author5=Carter, P. |title=Comparative evaluation of positron emission tomography radiotracers for imaging the norepinephrine transporter: (S,S) and (R,R) enantiomers of reboxetine analogs (<nowiki>[11C]methylreboxetine, 3-Cl-[11C]methylreboxetine and [18F]fluororeboxetine), (R)-[11C]nisoxetine, [11C]oxaprotiline and [11C]lortalamine</nowiki>|journal=Journal of Neurochemistry|year=2005|volume=94|issue=2|pages=337–51|doi=10.1111/j.1471-4159.2005.03202.x|pmid=15998285|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2005.03202.x/full}}</ref> [[Carbon-11|<sup>11</sup>C]]-labeled nisoxetine, synthesized by Haka and Kilbourn, was one possible candidate that was investigated for being used as a potential PET tracer.<ref name=NgPET/><ref name=Tej3HNis/> However, in vivo, <sup>11</sup>C-labeled nisoxetine exhibits nonspecific binding, therefore limiting its effectiveness as a possible ligand for PET.<ref name=Tej3HNis/>

==Pharmacological properties==
Nisoxetine is a potent and selective inhibitor of norepinephrine uptake, where it is about 1000-fold more potent in blocking norepinephrine uptake than that of serotonin.<ref name=GuinDAT>{{cite journal|vauthors=Palomar AR, Larios BN, De Sánchez VC, Pérez LM, López Fde L, Flores G, Gómez-Villalobos Mde J |title=Expression and distribution of dopamine transporter in cardiac tissues of the guinea pig|journal=Neurochemical Research|date=March 2011|volume=36|issue=3|pages=399–405|pmid=21170736|doi=10.1007/s11064-010-0344-7}}</ref> It is 400-fold more potent in blocking the uptake of norepinephrine than that of dopamine.

Activity of <sup>3</sup>H-NIS on cerebral cortical homogenates in mice show a K<sub>d</sub> of 0.80 + 0.11 nM and a B<sub>max</sub> of + 12 fmol/mg protein.<ref name=Tej3HNis/> Density of binding is generally associated with brain regions that exhibit norepinephrine levels, where the highest specific <sup>3</sup>H-NIS binding is in the brainstem (LC) and the thalamus.<ref name=TejLC/><ref name=DingPet/> Specific <sup>3</sup>H-NIS binding is dependent on sodium cations, where specific and total binding is raised as the concentration of sodium is increased (Tejani-Butt et al., 1990). This binding occurs with high affinity towards a single class of sites that have similar pharmacological characteristics of the norepinephrine uptake site.<ref name=Tej3HNis/>

Nisoxetine and other inhibitors of norepinephrine uptake sites are able to inhibit the binding of <sup>3</sup>H-NIS. When rats are intravenously injected with nisoxetine and the binding of <sup>3</sup>H-NIS is measured, the K<sub>i</sub> of nisoxetine is reported to be 0.8 + 0.1 nM for concentrations of up to 1 µM.<ref name=TejLC/>

==Adverse effects==
Norepinephrine, along with dopamine and/or other serotonin reuptake inhibitors, are often prescribed in the treatment of mood disorders and are generally well tolerated.

Preclinical studies in humans using nisoxetine were conducted in the 1970s, and side effects of the drug were examined.<ref name=Lemb/> Doses ranging from 1&nbsp;mg to 50&nbsp;mg do not result in any changes in base line values in haematologic tests, routine blood chemistries, or coagulation parameters.<ref name=Lemb/> Larger doses produce some side effects, but no electrocardiographic changes are observed in any doses.<ref name=Lemb/> Injections with doses of tyramine in humans while receiving nisoxetine results in a decreased responsiveness to tyramine with increased duration of administered nisoxetine.<ref name=Lemb/> Another effect of nisoxetine administration is that subjects require much smaller doses of norepinephrine to produce the same blood pressure responses as those who receive a placebo.<ref name=Lemb/> In other words, subjects exhibit an increased sensitivity to norepinephrine after nisoxetine administration.<ref name=Lemb/> Preclinical test conclude that the drug, in tested doses, appears to be safe for use in humans.<ref name=Lemb/>

==Chemical properties==
Nisoxetine is a [[racemic]] compound with two [[isomer]]s.

Tricyclic (three-ring) structures can be found in many different drugs, and for medicinal chemists allows restrictions for the conformational mobility of two phenyl rings attached to a common carbon or hetero (non-carbon) atom.<ref name=MedChem/> Small molecular changes, such as substituents or ring flexibility can cause changes in the pharmacological and physiochemical properties of a drug.<ref name=MedChem/> The mechanism of action for the phenoxyphenylpropyamines can be explained by the critical role of the type and position of the ring substitution.<ref name=MedChem/> The unsubstituted molecule is a weak SSRI.<ref name=MedChem/> A compound highly potent and selective for blocking norepinephrine reuptake, a SNRI, results from 2-substitutions into the phenoxy ring.<ref name=MedChem/>
