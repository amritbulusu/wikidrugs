'''Acetic acid''' {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|s|iː|t|ᵻ|k}}, systematically named '''ethanoic acid''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|θ|ə|ˈ|n|oʊ|ᵻ|k}}, is a colourless liquid [[organic compound]] with the [[chemical formula]] CH<sub>3</sub>COOH (also written as CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H or C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). When undiluted, it is sometimes called ''glacial acetic acid''. [[Vinegar]] is roughly 3–9% acetic acid by volume, making acetic acid the main component of [[vinegar]] apart from water. Acetic acid has a distinctive sour taste and pungent smell. In addition to household vinegar, it is mainly produced as a precursor to [[polyvinyl acetate]] and [[cellulose acetate]]. It is classified as a [[acid strength|weak acid]] since it only partially dissociates in solution, but concentrated acetic acid is corrosive and can attack the skin.

Acetic acid is the second simplest [[carboxylic acid]] (after [[formic acid]]).  It consists of a [[methyl group]] attached to a [[carboxylic acid|carboxyl group]]. It is an important [[reagent|chemical reagent]] and industrial chemical, used primarily in the production of [[cellulose acetate]] for [[photographic film]], [[polyvinyl acetate]] for wood [[Adhesive|glue]], and synthetic fibres and fabrics. In households, diluted acetic acid is often used in [[descaling agent]]s. In the [[food industry]], acetic acid is controlled by the [[E number|food additive code]] E260 as an [[acidity regulator]] and as a condiment. As a [[food additive]] it is approved for usage in many countries, including Canada,<ref name="CDJ2013">{{cite web|title=Food and Drug Regulations (C.R.C., c. 870) |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._870/FullText.html |work=Consolidated Regulations |publisher=Canadian Department of Justice |accessdate=21 July 2013 |date=31 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630134041/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.%2C_c._870/FullText.html |archivedate=30 June 2013}}</ref> the European Union,<ref>UK Food Standards Agency: {{cite web |url=http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/additivesbranch/enumberlist |title=Current EU approved additives and their E Numbers |accessdate=27 October 2011}}</ref> the United States,<ref>US Food and Drug Administration: {{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/FoodAdditives/FoodAdditiveListings/ucm091048.htm |title=Listing of Food Additives Status Part I |accessdate=27 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117060614/http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/FoodAdditives/FoodAdditiveListings/ucm091048.htm |archivedate=17 January 2012}}</ref> Australia and New Zealand.<ref>Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code{{cite web |url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2011C00827 |title=Standard 1.2.4 – Labeling of ingredients |accessdate=27 October 2011}}</ref> In [[biochemistry]], the acetyl group, derived from acetic acid, is fundamental to all forms of life. When bound to [[coenzyme A]], it is central to the [[metabolism]] of [[carbohydrate]]s and [[fat]]s.

The global demand for acetic acid is about 6.5 million [[metric ton]]s per year (Mt/a), of which approximately 1.5&nbsp;Mt/a is met by recycling; the remainder is manufactured from [[methanol]].<ref name=Ullmann/> Vinegar is mostly dilute acetic acid, often produced by [[ethanol fermentation|fermentation]] and subsequent oxidation of [[ethanol]].

==Nomenclature==
The [[trivial name]] ''acetic acid'' is the most commonly used and [[preferred IUPAC name]]. The systematic name ''ethanoic acid'', a valid [[IUPAC]] name, is constructed according to the substitutive nomenclature.<ref name="BB-prs310305">IUPAC Provisional Recommendations 2004 [http://old.iupac.org/reports/provisional/abstract04/BB-prs310305/Chapter1.pdf Chapter P-12.1; page 4]</ref> The name ''acetic acid'' derives from ''acetum'', the [[Latin]] word for [[vinegar]], and is related to the word [[acid]] itself.

''Glacial acetic acid'' is a name for water-free ([[anhydrous]]) acetic acid. Similar to the [[German language|German]] name ''Eisessig'' (''ice-vinegar''), the name comes from the ice-like crystals that form slightly below room temperature at {{convert|16.6|C|F}} (the presence of 0.1% water lowers its melting point by 0.2&nbsp;°C).<ref name="Purification of Laboratory Chemicals">{{cite book|author= Armarego, W.L.F. |author2=Chai, Christina |title=Purification of Laboratory Chemicals, 6th edition|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location=|year=2009|pages=|isbn=1-85617-567-7}}</ref>

A common abbreviation for acetic acid is ''AcOH'', where ''Ac'' stands for the [[acetyl]] [[functional group|group]] {{chem|C|H|3}}−C(=O)−. [[Acetate]] ({{chem|C|H|3|C|O|O|-}}) is abbreviated ''AcO<sup>−</sup>''. The ''Ac'' is not to be confused with the abbreviation for the [[chemical element]] [[actinium]].<ref name="Cooper">{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=Caroline |title=Organic Chemist's Desk Reference|edition=2|date=9 August 2010|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=1-4398-1166-0|pages=102–104}}</ref> To better reflect its structure, acetic acid is often written as {{chem|C|H|3}}–C(O)OH, {{chem|C|H|3}}−C(=O)OH, {{chem|C|H|3}}COOH, and {{chem|CH|3|CO|2|H}}. In the context of [[acid-base reaction]]s, the abbreviation ''HAc'' is sometimes used,<ref>{{cite book|last=DeSousa|first=Luís R. |title=Common Medical Abbreviations|year=1995|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=0-8273-6643-4|page=97}}</ref> where ''Ac'' in this case is a symbol for acetate (rather than acetyl). Acetate is the [[ion]] resulting from loss of {{chem|link=proton|H|+}} from acetic acid. The name ''acetate'' can also refer to a [[salt]] containing this anion, or an [[ester]] of acetic acid.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hendrickson|first1=James B. |last2=Cram|first2=Donald J. |last3=Hammond|first3=George S. |title=Organic Chemistry|edition=3|year=1970|publisher=McGraw Hill Kogakusha|location=Tokyo|page=135}}</ref>

==Properties==

===Acidity===
The hydrogen centre in the [[carboxyl group]] (−COOH) in carboxylic acids such as acetic acid can separate from the molecule by ionization:
:CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H → CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> + H<sup>+</sup>
Because of this release of the [[proton]] (H<sup>+</sup>), acetic acid has acidic character. Acetic acid is a weak [[monoprotic acid]]. In aqueous solution, it has a [[Acid dissociation constant|pK<sub>a</sub>]] value of 4.76.<ref name="Goldmine">

===Solvent properties===
[[Liquid]] acetic acid is a [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] ([[Polar molecule|polar]]) [[protic solvent]], similar to ethanol and [[water]]. With a moderate [[relative static permittivity]] (dielectric constant) of 6.2, it dissolves not only polar compounds such as inorganic salts and [[sugar]]s, but also non-polar compounds such as oils as well as polar solutes. It is miscible with polar and non-polar [[solvent]]s such as water, [[chloroform]], and [[hexane]]. With higher alkanes (starting with [[octane]]), acetic acid is not completely [[miscible]], and its miscibility declines with longer n-alkanes.<ref name="Zieborak">{{cite journal|title=none |first = K. |last=Zieborak |author2= Olszewski, K. |journal = Bulletin de L'Academie Polonaise des Sciences-Serie des Sciences Chimiques Geologiques et Geographiques |year = 1958|volume = 6|issue=2|pages=3315–3322}}</ref> The solvent and [[miscibility]] properties of acetic acid make it a useful industrial chemical, for example, as a solvent in the production of [[dimethyl terephthalate]].<ref name=Ullmann>{{Ullmann | author1 = Cheung, Hosea | author2 = Tanke, Robin S. | author3 = Torrence, G.

===Biochemistry===
At physiological pHs, acetic acid is usually fully ionised to [[acetate]].

The [[acetyl]] [[functional group|group]], formally derived from acetic acid, is fundamental to all forms of life. When bound to [[coenzyme A]], it is central to the [[metabolism]] of [[carbohydrate]]s and [[fat]]s. Unlike longer-chain carboxylic acids (the [[fatty acids]]), acetic acid does not occur in natural [[triglyceride]]s. However, the artificial triglyceride [[triacetin]] (glycerine triacetate) is a common food additive and is found in cosmetics and topical medicines.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fiume |first=M. Z. |date=June 2003|title=Final report on the safety assessment of triacetin|journal=International Journal of Toxicology|volume=22|issue=Suppl 2|pages=1–10|doi=10.1080/747398359|pmid=14555416|author2=Cosmetic Ingredients Review Expert Panel}}</ref>

<!--Can someone add something about how acetate is metabolized? Does it react spontaneously with CoA and then enter the citric acid cycle?-->
Acetic acid is produced and [[Excretion|excreted]] by [[acetic acid bacteria]], notably the ''[[Acetobacter]]'' genus and ''[[Clostridium acetobutylicum]]''. These bacteria are found universally in [[food]]stuffs, [[water]], and [[soil]], and acetic acid is produced naturally as fruits and other foods spoil. Acetic acid is also a component of the [[vaginal lubrication]] of [[human]]s and other [[primate]]s, where it appears to serve as a mild [[antibacterial]] agent.<ref name="dict">{{cite book|title = Dictionary of Organic Compounds|edition = 6th|volume = 1 |year = 1996|location = London|publisher = Chapman & Hall|isbn = 0-412-54090-8|editor= Buckingham, J.}}</ref>

==Production==
[[File:Acetic acid 1884 plant.jpg|thumb|Purification and concentration plant for acetic acid in 1884]]
Acetic acid is produced industrially both synthetically and by bacterial [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]]. About 75% of acetic acid made for use in the chemical industry is made by the [[carbonylation]] of methanol, explained below.<ref name=Ullmann/> The biological route accounts for only about 10% of world production, but it remains important for the production of vinegar because many food purity laws require vinegar used in foods to be of biological origin. As of 2003–2005, total worldwide production of virgin acetic acid<ref>Acetic acid that is manufactured by intent, rather than recovered from processing (such as the production of cellulose acetates, polyvinyl alcohol operations, and numerous acetic anhydride acylations).</ref> was estimated at 5&nbsp;Mt/a (million tonnes per year), approximately half of which was produced in the [[United States]]. [[Europe]]an production was approximately 1&nbsp;Mt/a and declining, while [[Japan]]ese production was 0.7&nbsp;Mt/a. Another 1.5&nbsp;Mt were recycled each year, bringing the total world market to 6.5&nbsp;Mt/a.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Production report|journal = Chemical & Engineering News |publication-date=11 July 2005 |pages=67–76}}</ref><ref name="suresh">{{cite book|author1= Malveda, Michael |author2=Funada, Chiyo |year=2003 |url=http://sriconsulting.com/CEH/Public/Reports/602.5000/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014162419/http://sriconsulting.com/CEH/Public/Reports/602.5000/|dead-url=yes |archivedate=14 October 2011 |chapter = Acetic Acid|title = Chemicals Economic Handbook|pages = 602.5000 |publisher = SRI International}}</ref> Since then the global production has increased to 10.7 Mt/a (in 2010), and further; however, a slowing in this increase in production is predicted.<ref>[http://chemical.ihs.com/WP/Public/Reports/acetic_acid/ Acetic Acid]. SRI Consulting.</ref> The two biggest producers of virgin acetic acid are [[Celanese]] and [[BP|BP Chemicals]]. Other major producers include [[Millennium Chemicals]], [[Sterling Chemicals]], [[Samsung]], [[Eastman Chemical Company|Eastman]], and [[Svensk Etanolkemi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reportlinker.com/p02284890/Acetic-Acid.html?|title=Reportlinker Adds Global Acetic Acid Market Analysis and Forecasts|date=June 2014|work=Market Research Database|page=contents}}</ref>

===Methanol carbonylation===
Most acetic acid is produced by methanol [[carbonylation]]. In this process, methanol and [[carbon monoxide]] react to produce acetic acid according to the equation:

:[[File:Methanol formylation.png|250px]]

The process involves [[iodomethane]] as an intermediate, and occurs in three steps. A [[catalyst]], [[metal carbonyl]], is needed for the carbonylation (step 2).<ref name=Yoneda2001>{{cite journal |author1=Yoneda, N. |author2=Kusano, S. |author3=Yasui, M. |author4=Pujado, P. |author5=Wilcher, S. |year=2001 |title=Recent advances in processes and catalysts for the production of acetic acid |journal=Applied Catalysis A: General |volume=221 |issue=1–2 |pages=253–265 |doi=10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00800-6}}</ref>
#CH<sub>3</sub>OH + HI → CH<sub>3</sub>I + H<sub>2</sub>O
#CH<sub>3</sub>I + CO → CH<sub>3</sub>COI
#CH<sub>3</sub>COI + H<sub>2</sub>O → CH<sub>3</sub>COOH + HI

Two related processes for the carbonylation of methanol: the rhodium-catalyzed [[Monsanto process]], and the iridium-catalyzed [[Cativa process]]. The latter process is [[Green chemistry|greener]] and more efficient<ref name="lancaster"/> and has largely supplanted the former process, often in the same production plants. Catalytic amounts of water are used in both processes, but the Cativa process requires less, so the [[water-gas shift reaction]] is suppressed, and fewer by-products are formed.

By altering the process conditions, [[acetic anhydride]] may also be produced on the same plant using the rhodium catalysts.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Zoeller, J. R. |author2=Agreda, V. H. |author3=Cook, S. L. |author4=Lafferty, N. L. |author5=Polichnowski, S. W. |author6=Pond, D.

===Acetaldehyde oxidation===
Prior to the commercialization of the Monsanto process, most acetic acid was produced by oxidation of [[acetaldehyde]]. This remains the second-most-important manufacturing method, although it is usually not competitive with the carbonylation of methanol. The acetaldehyde can be produced by [[alkyne hydration|hydration of acetylene]]. This was the dominant technology in the early 1900s.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1055/s-2007-966002|title=Catalytic Hydration of Alkynes and Its Application in Synthesis|journal=Synthesis|volume=2007|issue=8|pages=1121|year=2007|last1=Hintermann|first1=Lukas|last2=Labonne|first2=Aurélie|url=http://www.xiuzhengrd.com/ejournals/pdf/synthesis/doi/10.1055/s-2007-966002.pdf}}</ref>

Light [[naphtha]] components are readily oxidized by oxygen or even air to give [[organic peroxide|peroxides]], which decompose to produce acetic acid according to the [[chemical equation]], illustrated with butane:
: 2 C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub> + 5 O<sub>2</sub> → 4 CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O
Such oxidations require metal catalyst, such as the naphthenatel [[salt]]s of [[manganese]], [[cobalt]], and [[chromium]].

The typical reaction is conducted at [[temperature]]s and pressures designed to be as hot as possible while still keeping the butane a liquid. Typical reaction conditions are {{convert|150|C|F}} and 55&nbsp;atm.<ref>{{cite book|last=Chenier|first=Philip J. |title=Survey of Industrial Chemistry|edition=3|year=2002|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-306-47246-5|page=151}}</ref> Side-products may also form, including [[butanone]], [[ethyl acetate]], [[formic acid]], and [[propionic acid]]. These side-products are also commercially valuable, and the reaction conditions may be altered to produce more of them where needed. However, the separation of acetic acid from these by-products adds to the cost of the process.<ref name="Sano1999">{{cite journal|last=Sano|first=Ken‐ichi|author2=Uchida, Hiroshi |author3= Wakabayashi, Syoichirou |year=1999|title=A new process for acetic acid production by direct oxidation of ethylene|journal=Catalysis Surveys from Japan|volume=3|issue=1|pages=55–60|issn=1384-6574|doi=10.1023/A:1019003230537}}</ref>

Under similar conditions and using similar [[catalyst]]s as are used for butane oxidation, the [[oxygen]] in [[Earth's atmosphere|air]] to produce acetic acid can oxidize [[acetaldehyde]].<ref name="Sano1999"/>

: 2 CH<sub>3</sub>CHO + O<sub>2</sub> → 2 CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H

Using modern catalysts, this reaction can have an acetic acid yield greater than 95%. The major side-products are [[ethyl acetate]], [[formic acid]], and [[formaldehyde]], all of which have lower [[boiling point]]s than acetic acid and are readily separated by [[distillation]].<ref name="Sano1999"/>

===Ethylene oxidation===
Acetaldehyde may be prepared from [[ethylene]] via the [[Wacker process]], and then oxidised as above.

In more recent times, chemical company [[Showa Denko]], which opened an ethylene oxidation plant in [[Ōita Prefecture|Ōita]], [[Japan]], in 1997, commercialised a cheaper single-stage conversion of ethylene to acetic acid.<ref name="sano">{{cite book|last = Sano|first = Ken-ichi|author2 = Uchida, Hiroshi|author3= Wakabayashi, Syoichirou|year = 1999|title = A new process for acetic acid production by direct oxidation of ethylene|journal = [[Catalyst Surveys from Japan]]|volume = 3|pages = 66–60|doi = 10.1023/A:1019003230537}}</ref> The process is catalyzed by a [[palladium]] metal catalyst supported on a [[heteropoly acid]] such as [[silicotungstic acid]].

It is thought to be competitive with methanol carbonylation for smaller plants (100–250&nbsp;kt/a), depending on the local price of ethylene.
The approach will be based on utilizing a novel selective photocatalytic oxidation technology for the selective oxidation of ethylene and ethane to acetic acid. Unlike traditional oxidation catalysts, the selective oxidation process will use UV light to produce acetic acid at ambient temperatures and pressure.

===Oxidative fermentation===
For most of human history, acetic acid bacteria of the genus ''[[Acetobacter]]'' have made acetic acid, in the form of vinegar. Given sufficient oxygen, these bacteria can produce vinegar from a variety of alcoholic foodstuffs. Commonly used feeds include [[Cider|apple cider]], [[wine]], and fermented [[cereal|grain]], [[malt]], [[rice]], or [[potato]] mashes. The overall chemical reaction facilitated by these bacteria is:

: C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH + O<sub>2</sub> → CH<sub>3</sub>COOH + H<sub>2</sub>O

A dilute alcohol solution inoculated with ''Acetobacter'' and kept in a warm, airy place will become vinegar over the course of a few months. Industrial vinegar-making methods accelerate this process by improving the supply of [[oxygen]] to the bacteria.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chotani |first1=Gopal K. |last2=Gaertner |first2=Alfred L. |last3= Arbige |first3=Michael V. |author4=Dodge, Timothy C. |title=Kent and Riegel's Handbook of Industrial Chemistry and Biotechnology|year=2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-27842-1|pages=32–34|chapter=Industrial Biotechnology: Discovery to Delivery}}</ref>

The first batches of vinegar produced by fermentation probably followed errors in the [[winemaking]] process. If [[must]] is fermented at too high a temperature, acetobacter will overwhelm the [[yeast (wine)|yeast]] naturally occurring on the [[grapes]]. As the demand for vinegar for culinary, medical, and sanitary purposes increased, vintners quickly learned to use other organic materials to produce vinegar in the hot summer months before the grapes were ripe and ready for processing into wine. This method was slow, however, and not always successful, as the vintners did not understand the process.<ref name="Hromatka">{{cite journal|title = Vinegar by Submerged Oxidative Fermentation|author1=Hromatka, Otto |author2=Ebner, Heinrich |journal = Industrial & Engineering Chemistry|year = 1959|volume = 51|issue = 10|pages = 1279–1280| doi = 10.1021/ie50598a033}}</ref>

One of the first modern commercial processes was the "fast method" or "German method", first practised in Germany in 1823.<!-- http://www.google.de/patents?id=-stnAAAAEBAJ --> In this process, fermentation takes place in a tower packed with wood shavings or [[charcoal]]. The alcohol-containing feed is trickled into the top of the tower, and fresh [[Earth's atmosphere|air]] supplied from the bottom by either natural or forced [[convection]]. The improved air supply in this process cut the time to prepare vinegar from months to weeks.<ref>{{cite journal|title = Acetic Acid and Cellulose Acetate in the United States A General Survey of Economic and Technical Developments|author = Partridge, Everett P. |journal = Industrial & Engineering Chemistry|year = 1931|volume = 23|issue =5|pages = 482–498|doi = 10.1021/ie50257a005}}</ref>

Nowadays, most vinegar is made in submerged tank [[Microbiological culture|culture]], first described in 1949 by Otto Hromatka and Heinrich Ebner.<ref>{{cite journal|title = Investigations on vinegar fermentation: Generator for vinegar fermentation and aeration procedures|author1=Hromatka, O. |author2=Ebner, H. |journal = Enzymologia|volume=13|page=369|year = 1949}}</ref> In this method, alcohol is fermented to vinegar in a continuously stirred tank, and oxygen is supplied by bubbling air through the solution. Using modern applications of this method, vinegar of 15% acetic acid can be prepared in only 24 hours in batch process, even 20% in 60-hour fed-batch process.<ref name="Hromatka"/>

===Anaerobic fermentation===
Species of [[anaerobic bacteria]], including members of the genus ''[[Clostridium]]'' or ''[[Acetobacterium]]'' can convert sugars to acetic acid directly without creating ethanol as an intermediate. The overall chemical reaction conducted by these bacteria may be represented as:
: C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> → 3 CH<sub>3</sub>COOH

These [[Acetogen|acetogenic bacteria]] produce acetic acid from one-carbon compounds, including methanol, [[carbon monoxide]], or a mixture of [[carbon dioxide]] and [[hydrogen]]:
: 2 CO<sub>2</sub> + 4 H<sub>2</sub> → CH<sub>3</sub>COOH + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O

This ability of ''Clostridium'' to metabolize sugars directly, or to produce acetic acid from less costly inputs, suggests that these bacteria could produce acetic acid more efficiently than ethanol-oxidizers like ''Acetobacter''. However, ''Clostridium'' bacteria are less acid-tolerant than ''Acetobacter''. Even the most acid-tolerant ''Clostridium'' strains can produce vinegar in concentrations of only a few per cent, compared to ''Acetobacter'' strains that can produce vinegar in concentrations up to 20%. At present, it remains more cost-effective to produce vinegar using ''Acetobacter'', rather than using ''Clostridium'' and concentrating it. As a result, although acetogenic bacteria have been known since 1940, their industrial use is confined to a few niche applications.<ref>{{cite journal|journal = Enzyme and Microbial Technology|volume = 40|issue = 5|year = 2007|pages = 1234–1243|

==Uses==
Acetic acid is a chemical [[reagent]] for the production of chemical compounds. The largest single use of acetic acid is in the production of vinyl acetate [[monomer]], closely followed by acetic anhydride and ester production. The volume of acetic acid used in vinegar is comparatively small.<ref name = Ullmann/><ref name="suresh"/>

===Vinyl acetate monomer===
The primary use of acetic acid is the production of [[vinyl acetate|vinyl acetate monomer (VAM)]]. In 2008, this application was estimated to consume a third of the world's production of acetic acid.<ref name = Ullmann/> The reaction consists of [[ethylene]] and acetic acid with [[oxygen]] over a [[palladium]] [[catalyst]], conducted in the gas phase.<ref name = vinyl-esters>{{Ullmann | title = VInyl Esters | author = Roscher, Günter | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a27_419}}</ref>
: 2 H<sub>3</sub>C−COOH + 2 C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → 2 H<sub>3</sub>C−CO−O−CH=CH<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O
Vinyl acetate can be polymerised to [[polyvinyl acetate]] or other [[polymers]], which are components in [[paint]]s and [[adhesive]]s.<ref name = vinyl-esters/>

===Ester production===
The major [[ester]]s of acetic acid are commonly used as solvents for [[ink]]s, [[paint]]s and [[coating]]s. The esters include [[ethyl acetate]], ''n''-[[butyl acetate]], [[isobutyl acetate]], and [[propyl acetate]]. They are typically produced by [[catalyst|catalyzed]] reaction from acetic acid and the corresponding [[alcohol]]:
: H<sub>3</sub>C−COOH + HO−R → H<sub>3</sub>C−CO−O−R + H<sub>2</sub>O, (R = a general [[alkyl group]])

Most acetate esters, however, are produced from [[acetaldehyde]] using the [[Tishchenko reaction]]. In addition, ether acetates are used as solvents for [[nitrocellulose]], [[Acrylic paint|acrylic lacquers]], [[varnish]] removers, and wood stains. First, glycol monoethers are produced from [[ethylene oxide]] or [[propylene oxide]] with alcohol, which are then esterified with acetic acid. The three major products are ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate (EEA), ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate (EBA), and propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PMA, more commonly known as PGMEA in semiconductor manufacturing processes, where it is used as a resist solvent). This application consumes about 15% to 20% of worldwide acetic acid. Ether acetates, for example EEA, have been shown to be harmful to human reproduction.<ref name="suresh"/>

===Acetic anhydride===
The product of the [[condensation reaction|condensation]] of two molecules of acetic acid is [[acetic anhydride]]. The worldwide production of acetic anhydride is a major application, and uses approximately 25% to 30% of the global production of acetic acid. The main process involves dehydration of acetic acid to give [[ketene]] at 700–750&nbsp;°C. Ketene is thereafter reacted with acetic acid to obtain the anhydride:<ref name = acetic-anh>{{Ullmann | title = Acetic Anhydride and Mixed Fatty Acid Anhydrides | author1 = Held, Heimo | author2 = Rengstl, Alfred | author3 = Mayer, Dieter | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a01_065}}</ref>

:CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H + CH<sub>2</sub>=C=O → (CH<sub>3</sub>CO)<sub>2</sub>O

Acetic anhydride is an [[acetylation]] agent. As such, its major application is for [[cellulose acetate]], a synthetic [[textile]] also used for [[photographic film]]. Acetic anhydride is also a reagent for the production of [[heroin]] and other compounds.<ref name = acetic-anh/>

===Use as solvent===
Glacial acetic acid is an excellent polar [[protic solvent]], as noted [[Acetic acid#Solvent properties|above]]. It is frequently used as a solvent for [[recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]] to purify organic compounds. Acetic acid is used as a [[solvent]] in the production of [[terephthalic acid]] (TPA), the raw material for [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET). In 2006, about 20% of acetic acid was used for TPA production.<ref name="suresh"/>

Acetic acid is often used as a solvent for reactions involving [[carbocation]]s, such as [[Friedel-Crafts#Friedel–Crafts alkylation|Friedel-Crafts alkylation]]. For example, one stage in the commercial manufacture of synthetic [[camphor]] involves a [[Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement]] of [[camphene]] to [[isobornyl acetate]]; here acetic acid acts both as a solvent and as a [[nucleophile]] to trap the [[rearrangement reaction|rearranged]] carbocation.<ref name="sell">{{cite book|last=Sell|first=Charles S. |title=The Chemistry of Fragrances: From Perfumer to Consumer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G90hcKHwrqEC&pg=PA80|edition=2|series=RSC Paperbacks Series|volume=38|year=2006|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|location=Great Britain|isbn=0-85404-824-3|page=80|chapter=4.2.15 Bicyclic Monoterpenoids}}</ref>

Glacial acetic acid is used in analytical chemistry for the estimation of weakly alkaline substances such as organic amides. Glacial acetic acid is a much weaker [[base (chemistry)|base]] than water, so the amide behaves as a strong base in this medium. It then can be titrated using a solution in glacial acetic acid of a very strong acid, such as [[perchloric acid]].<ref name="Felgner">{{cite web |url=http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/technical-documents/articles/analytical-applications/karl-fischer/water-determination-in-perchloric-acid-0-1-mol-l-in-acetic-acid.html |title=Determination of Water Content in Perchloric acid 0,1 mol/L in acetic acid Using Karl Fischer Titration |deadurl=no |archivedate= |last=Felgner |first=Andrea |publisher=Sigma-Aldrich |accessdate=27 July 2017}}</ref>

===Foods===
{{main article|Vinegar}}
Vinegar is typically 4–18% acetic acid by mass. Vinegar is used directly as a [[condiment]], and in the [[pickling]] of vegetables and other foods. Table vinegar tends to be more diluted (4% to 8% acetic acid), while commercial food pickling employs solutions that are more concentrated. The proportion of acetic acid used worldwide as vinegar is not as large as commercial uses, but is by far the oldest and best-known application.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bernthsen|first1=A. |last2=Sudborough|first2=J.

==Reactions==
===Organic chemistry===

[[File:Acetic acid organic reactions.png|400px|Two typical organic reactions of acetic acid]]

Acetic acid undergoes the typical [[chemical reaction]]s of a carboxylic acid. Upon treatment with a standard base, it converts to metal [[acetate]] and [[water]]. With strong bases (e.g., organolithium reagents), it can be doubly deprotonated to give LiCH<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>Li. Reduction of acetic acid gives ethanol. The OH group is the main site of reaction, as illustrated by the conversion of acetic acid to [[acetyl chloride]]. Other substitution derivatives include [[acetic anhydride]]; this [[anhydride]] is produced by [[Condensation reaction|loss of water]] from two molecules of acetic acid. [[Ester]]s of acetic acid can likewise be formed via [[Fischer esterification]], and [[amide]]s can be formed. When heated above {{convert|440|C|F}}, acetic acid decomposes to produce [[carbon dioxide]] and [[methane]], or to produce [[ketene]] and water:<ref>{{cite journal |title=The thermal decomposition of acetic acid |journal=Journal of the Chemical Society B: Physical Organic |year=1968 |pages=1153–1155 |author1=Blake, P.

Acetic acid is mildly [[corrosion|corrosive]] to [[metal]]s including [[iron]], [[magnesium]], and [[zinc]], forming [[hydrogen]] gas and salts called [[acetate]]s:
: Mg + 2 CH<sub>3</sub>COOH → (CH<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub>Mg + H<sub>2</sub>
Because [[aluminium]] forms a [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivating]] acid-resistant film of [[aluminium oxide]], aluminium tanks are used to transport acetic acid.

===Other derivatives===
Organic or inorganic salts are produced from acetic acid, including:

*[[Copper(II) acetate]], used as a [[pigment]] and a [[fungicide]].
*[[Aluminium acetate]] and [[iron(II) acetate]]—used as [[mordant]]s for [[dye]]s.
*[[Palladium(II) acetate]], used as a catalyst for organic coupling reactions such as the [[Heck reaction]].
*[[Silver acetate]], used as a [[pesticide]].

Substituted acetic acids produced include:
*[[Chloroacetic acid]] (monochloroacetic acid, MCA), dichloroacetic acid (considered a by-product), and [[trichloroacetic acid]]. MCA is used in the manufacture of [[indigo dye]].
*[[Bromoacetic acid]], which is esterified to produce the reagent [[ethyl bromoacetate]].
*[[Trifluoroacetic acid]], which is a common reagent in [[organic synthesis]].

Amounts of acetic acid used in these other applications together (apart from TPA) account for another 5–10% of acetic acid use worldwide. These applications are, however, not expected to grow as much as TPA production.<ref name="suresh"/>

==History==
[[Vinegar]] was known early in civilization as the natural result of exposure of [[beer]] and [[wine]] to air, because acetic acid-producing bacteria are present globally. The use of acetic acid in [[alchemy]] extends into the 3rd century BC, when the [[Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Theophrastus]] described how vinegar acted on metals to produce [[pigment]]s useful in art, including ''white lead'' ([[lead carbonate]]) and ''[[verdigris]]'', a green mixture of [[copper]] salts including [[copper(II) acetate]]. Ancient [[Rome|Romans]] boiled soured wine to produce a highly sweet syrup called ''sapa''. [[Defrutum|Sapa]] that was produced in lead pots was rich in [[Lead(II) acetate|lead acetate]], a sweet substance also called ''sugar of lead'' or ''sugar of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]'', which contributed to [[lead poisoning]] among the Roman aristocracy.<ref name="martin">{{cite book|last = Martin|first = Geoffrey|year = 1917|title = Industrial and Manufacturing Chemistry|edition = Part 1, Organic|location = London|publisher = Crosby Lockwood|pages=330–331}}</ref>

In the 16th-century [[Germany|German]] alchemist [[Andreas Libavius]] described the production of [[acetone]] from the [[dry distillation]] of lead acetate, [[ketonic decarboxylation]]. The presence of water in vinegar has such a profound effect on acetic acid's properties that for centuries chemists believed that glacial acetic acid and the acid found in vinegar were two different substances. French chemist [[Pierre Adet]] proved them identical.<ref name="martin"/><ref>{{cite journal|author=Adet, P. A. |year=1798|title=Mémoire sur l'acide acétique (Memoir on acetic acid)|journal=Annales de Chimie|volume=27|pages=299–319}}</ref>
[[File:AceticAcid012.jpg|upright|thumb|alt=glass beaker of crystallised acetic acid|Crystallised acetic acid.]]
In 1845 German chemist [[Hermann Kolbe]] [[Chemical synthesis|synthesised]] acetic acid from [[inorganic compound]]s for the first time. This reaction sequence consisted of [[halogenation|chlorination]] of [[carbon disulfide]] to [[carbon tetrachloride]], followed by [[pyrolysis]] to [[tetrachloroethylene]] and aqueous chlorination to [[trichloroacetic acid]], and concluded with [[electrolysis|electrolytic]] [[organic redox reaction|reduction]] to acetic acid.<ref name="goldwhite">{{cite journal|url = http://membership.acs.org/N/NewHaven/bulletins/Bulletin_2003-09.pdf|last = Goldwhite|first = Harold|journal = New Haven Section Bulletin American Chemical Society|volume = 20|issue = 3|page=4|date=September 2003|title = This month in chemical history|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304210839/http://membership.acs.org/N/NewHaven/bulletins/Bulletin_2003-09.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2009}}</ref>

By 1910, most glacial acetic acid was obtained from the [[pyroligneous acid|pyroligneous liquor]], a product of the distillation of wood. The acetic acid was isolated by treatment with [[calcium hydroxide|milk of lime]], and the resulting [[calcium acetate]] was then acidified with [[sulfuric acid]] to recover acetic acid. At that time, Germany was producing 10,000 [[ton]]s of glacial acetic acid, around 30% of which was used for the manufacture of [[indigo dye]].<ref name="martin"/><ref name="schweppe">{{cite journal|last = Schweppe|first = Helmut|year = 1979|url = http://aic.stanford.edu/jaic/articles/jaic19-01-003_1.html|title = Identification of dyes on old textiles|journal = Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|volume = 19|issue = 1/3|pages=14–23|doi = 10.2307/3179569|jstor = 3179569}}</ref>

Because both [[methanol]] and [[carbon monoxide]] are commodity raw materials, methanol carbonylation long appeared to be attractive precursors to acetic acid. [[Henri Dreyfus]] at [[British Celanese]] developed a methanol carbonylation pilot plant as early as 1925.<ref name="wagner">{{cite book|last = Wagner|first = Frank S. |year = 1978|chapter = Acetic acid|editor-last = Grayson|editor-first = Martin|title = Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology|edition = 3rd|location = New York|publisher = [[John Wiley & Sons]]}}</ref> However, a lack of practical materials that could contain the corrosive reaction mixture at the high [[pressure]]s needed (200 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]] or more) discouraged commercialization of these routes. The first commercial methanol carbonylation process, which used a [[cobalt]] catalyst, was developed by German chemical company [[BASF]] in 1963. In 1968, a [[rhodium]]-based catalyst (''cis''−[Rh(CO)<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub>]<sup>−</sup>) was discovered that could operate efficiently at lower pressure with almost no by-products. US chemical company [[Monsanto Company]] built the first plant using this catalyst in 1970, and rhodium-catalyzed methanol carbonylation became the dominant method of acetic acid production (see [[Monsanto process]]). In the late 1990s, the chemicals company [[BP|BP Chemicals]] commercialised the [[Cativa process|Cativa]] catalyst ([Ir(CO)<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub>]<sup>−</sup>), which is promoted by [[iridium]]<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=4KHzc-nYPNsC&pg=PA365&dq=Cativa+BP&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LYYZVZ5_jN2wBILkgqAK&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Cativa%20BP&f=false Industrial Organic Chemicals], Harold A. Wittcoff, Bryan G. Reuben, Jeffery S. Plotkin</ref> for greater efficiency. This [[iridium]]-catalyzed [[Cativa process]] is [[Green chemistry|greener]] and more efficient<ref name="lancaster">{{cite book|last = Lancaster|first = Mike|year = 2002|title = Green Chemistry, an Introductory Text|location = Cambridge|publisher = Royal Society of Chemistry|pages=262–266|isbn = 0-85404-620-8}}</ref> and has largely supplanted the Monsanto process, often in the same production plants.

===Interstellar medium===
[[Interstellar medium|Interstellar]] acetic acid was discovered in 1996 by a team led by David Mehringer<ref name=Meh>{{Cite journal | display-authors=1 | last1=Mehringer | first1=David M. | last2=Snyder | first2=Lewis E. | last3=Miao | first3=Yanti | last4=Lovas | first4=Frank J. | title=Detection and Confirmation of Interstellar Acetic Acid | journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters | year=1997 | volume=480 | page=L71 | bibcode=1997ApJ...480L..71M | doi=10.1086/310612}}</ref> using the former [[Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association]] array at the [[Hat Creek Radio Observatory]] and the former [[Millimeter Array]] located at the [[Owens Valley Radio Observatory]]. It was first detected in the [[Sagittarius B2]] North molecular cloud (also known as the Sgr B2 [[Large Molecule Heimat]] source). Acetic acid has the distinction of being the first molecule discovered in the interstellar medium using solely [[Radio telescope#Radio interferometry|radio interferometers]]; in all previous ISM molecular discoveries made in the millimetre and centimetre wavelength regimes, single dish radio telescopes were at least partly responsible for the detections.<ref name=Meh/>

==Health effects and safety==
Concentrated acetic acid is [[corrosion|corrosive]] to skin and must therefore be handled with appropriate care to avoid skin burns, permanent eye damage, and irritation to the mucous membranes.<ref name="IPCS card">{{cite web | url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/icsc/icsc/eics0363.htm | title=ICSC 0363 – ACETIC ACID | publisher=International Programme on Chemical Safety | date=5 June 2010}}</ref><ref name=CDC>{{cite web | url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/81-123/pdfs/0002-rev.pdf | title=Occupational Safety and Health Guideline for Acetic Acid | publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=8 May 2013}}</ref> These burns or blisters may not appear until hours after exposure.

Prolonged skin contact with glacial acetic acid may result in tissue destruction. Inhalation exposure (eight hours) to acetic acid vapours at 10 ppm can produce some irritation of eyes, nose, and throat; at 100 ppm marked lung irritation and possible damage to lungs, eyes, and skin may result. Vapour concentrations of 1,000 ppm cause marked irritation of eyes, nose and upper respiratory tract and cannot be tolerated. These predictions were based on animal experiments and industrial exposure. Skin sensitization to acetic acid is rare, but has occurred.

It has been reported that, in 12 workers exposed for two or more years to acetic acid airborne average concentration of 51 ppm (estimated), produced symptoms of conjunctive irritation, upper respiratory tract irritation, and hyperkeratotic dermatitis. Exposure to 50 ppm or more is intolerable to most persons and results in intensive lacrimation and irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, with pharyngeal oedema and chronic bronchitis. Unacclimatised humans experience extreme eye and nasal irritation at concentrations in excess of 25 ppm, and conjunctivitis from concentrations below 10 ppm has been reported. In a study of five workers exposed for seven to 12 years to concentrations of 80 to 200 ppm at peaks, the principal findings were blackening and hyperkeratosis of the skin of the hands, conjunctivitis (but no corneal damage), bronchitis and pharyngitis, and erosion of the exposed teeth (incisors and canines).<ref>{{citation |publisher=Virginia Department of Health Division of Health Hazards Control |first=Peter C. |last= Sherertz |date=1 June 1994 |title=Acetic Acid |url=http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/epidemiology/DEE/PublicHealthToxicology/documents/pdf/aceticacid.PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110629/http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/epidemiology/DEE/PublicHealthToxicology/documents/pdf/aceticacid.PDF|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 March 2016}}</ref>

The hazards of solutions of acetic acid depend on the concentration. The following table lists the [[Directive 67/548/EEC|EU classification]] of acetic acid solutions:<ref name="Yee13">{{cite web |url=http://hsis.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/downloads/HSIS%20Consolidated%20List%20-%20Alphabetical%20Index.xlsx |title=HSIS Consolidated List – Alphabetical Index|last=Yee|first=Allan|date=10 May 2013|publisher=Safe Work Australia|accessdate=11 June 2013}}</ref>

Solutions at more than 25% acetic acid are handled in a fume hood because of the pungent, corrosive vapour. [[Concentration|Dilute]] acetic acid, in the form of [[vinegar]], is practically harmless. However, ingestion of stronger solutions is dangerous to human and animal life. It can cause severe damage to the [[digestive system]], and a potentially lethal change in the acidity of the [[blood]].

Due to incompatibilities, it is recommended to keep acetic acid away from [[chromic acid]], [[ethylene glycol]], [[nitric acid]], [[perchloric acid]], [[permanganate]]s, [[peroxide]]s and [[hydroxyl]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9922769|title=Acetic acid MSDS|date=21 May 2013|accessdate=7 June 2013}}</ref>

Concentrated acetic acid can be ignited only with difficulty at standard temperature and pressure, but becomes a flammable risk in temperatures greater than {{convert|39|C|F}}, and can form explosive mixtures with air at higher temperatures ([[explosive limit]]s: 5.4–16%).
