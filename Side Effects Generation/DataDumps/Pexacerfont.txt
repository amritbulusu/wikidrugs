'''Pexacerfont''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]],<ref>{{cite web|title=International Nonproprietary Names for Pharmaceutical Substances (INN). RECOMMENDED International Nonproprietary Names: List 59|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/druginformation/innlists/RL59.pdf|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=16 July 2016|page=60}}</ref> previously known as '''BMS-562,086''') is a drug developed by [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] which acts as a [[corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1|CRF<sub>1</sub>]] antagonist. 

Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), also known as [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]], is an endogenous peptide hormone which is released in response to various triggers such as [[chronic stress]]. This then triggers the release of [[Adrenocorticotropic hormone|corticotropin]] (ACTH), another hormone which is involved in the physiological response to stress. Chronic release of CRF and ACTH is believed to be directly or indirectly involved in many of the harmful physiological effects of chronic stress, such as excessive [[glucocorticoid]] release, [[diabetes mellitus]], [[osteoporosis]], [[Peptic ulcer|stomach ulcers]], [[anxiety]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and development of [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]] and consequent cardiovascular problems.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1196/annals.1367.021 |pmid=17148743 |title=Potential Uses of Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Antagonists |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=1083 |pages=239–51 |year=2006 |last1=Zoumakis |first1=E |last2=Rice |first2=K.

Pexacerfont is a recently developed CRF-1 antagonist which was in clinical trials for the treatment of [[anxiety disorder]]s,<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00481325|Study of Pexacerfont (BMS-562086) in the Treatment of Outpatients With Generalized Anxiety Disorder}}</ref> and has also been proposed to be useful for the treatment of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and [[irritable bowel syndrome]].{{cn|date=July 2016}}

A recent multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial found that pexacerfont (100 mg/day) did not separate from placebo on the primary outcome measure (the mean change from baseline to end point in the [[Hamilton Anxiety Scale]] score).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/da.20695 |pmid=20455246 |title=Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active comparator and placebo-controlled trial of a corticotropin-releasing factor receptor-1 antagonist in generalized anxiety disorder |journal=Depression and Anxiety |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=417–25 |year=2010 |last1=Coric |first1=Vladimir |last2=Feldman |first2=Howard H. |last3=Oren |first3=Dan A. |last4=Shekhar |first4=Anantha |last5=Pultz |first5=Joseph |last6=Dockens |first6=Randy C. |last7=Wu |first7=Xiaoling |last8=Gentile |first8=Kimberly A. |last9=Huang |first9=Shu-Pang |last10=Emison |first10=Eileen |last11=Delmonte |first11=Terrye |last12=d'Souza |first12=Bernadette B. |last13=Zimbroff |first13=Daniel L. |last14=Grebb |first14=Jack A. |last15=Goddard |first15=Andrew W. |last16=Stock |first16=Elyse G. }}</ref> These results suggest that blockade of CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor may not be a feasible treatment for anxiety disorders in certain human populations.
