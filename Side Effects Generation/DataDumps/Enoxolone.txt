'''Enoxolone''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]]; also known as '''glycyrrhetinic acid''' or '''glycyrrhetic acid''') is a pentacyclic [[triterpenoid]] derivative of the [[beta-amyrin]] type obtained from the [[hydrolysis]] of [[glycyrrhizic acid]], which was obtained from the herb [[liquorice]]. It is used in [[flavoring]] and it masks the bitter taste of drugs like [[aloe]] and [[quinine]]. It is effective in the treatment of [[peptic ulcer]] and also has [[cough medicine|expectorant]] (antitussive) properties.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Liquorice, more than just a flavour | journal = Canadian Pharmaceutical Journal | year = 1985 | first = RF | last = Chandler | issue = 118 | pages = 420–4| id = }}</ref>  It has some additional pharmacological properties including antiviral, antifungal, antiprotozoal, and antibacterial activities.<ref name=glycyrrhetinic1>{{cite journal |author1 =Badam, L. |author2 =Amagaya, S. |author3 =Pollard, B. |title=In vitro activity of licorice and glycyrrhetinic acid on Japanese encephalitis virus. | journal=J.

==Mechanism of action==
Glycyrrhetinic acid inhibits the [[enzyme]]s ([[15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (NAD+)|15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase]] and delta-13-prostaglandin) that metabolize the [[prostaglandin]]s PGE-2 and PGF-2α to their respective 15-keto-13,14-dihydro [[metabolite]]s which are inactive.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}} This causes an increased level of prostaglandins in the digestive system.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}} Prostaglandins inhibit gastric secretion but stimulate [[pancreas|pancreatic]] secretion and mucous secretion in the [[intestines]] and markedly increase intestinal motility.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}} They also cause cell proliferation in the [[stomach]].{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}} The effect on [[gastric acid]] secretion, promotion of mucous secretion and cell proliferation shows why licorice has potential in treating peptic ulcer.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}}

PGF-2α stimulates activity of the uterus during pregnancy and can cause abortion, therefore, licorice should not be taken during pregnancy.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}}

The structure of glycyrrhetinic acid is similar to that of [[cortisone]]. Both molecules are flat and similar at position 3 and 11. This might be the basis for licorice's [[anti-inflammatory]] action.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}}

3-β-<small>D</small>-(Monoglucuronyl)-18-β-glycyrrhetinic acid, a metabolite of glycyrrhetinic acid, inhibits the conversion of 'active' [[cortisol]] to 'inactive' [[cortisone]] in the [[kidneys]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title = 3-Monoglucuronyl-glycyrrhetinic acid is a major metabolite that causes licorice-induced pseudoaldosteronism|journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism|date = 1995-06-01|issn = 0021-972X|pmid = 7775643|pages = 1929–1933|volume = 80|issue = 6|doi = 10.1210/jcem.80.6.7775643|first = H.|last = Kato|first2 = M.|last2 = Kanaoka|first3 = S.|last3 = Yano|first4 = M.|last4 = Kobayashi}}</ref> This occurs via inhibition of the enzyme by inhibiting the enzyme [[11Beta Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase|11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]].{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}} As a result, cortisol levels are high within the collecting duct of the kidney. Cortisol has intrinsic mineralocorticoid properties (that is, it acts like [[aldosterone]] and increases [[sodium]] reabsorption) that work on ENaC channels in the collecting duct. {{Citation needed|date = December 2015}}[[Hypertension]] develops due to this mechanism of sodium retention. People often have [[high blood pressure]] with a low [[renin]] and low [[aldosterone]] blood level.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}} The increased amounts of cortisol binds to the unprotected, unspecific mineralocorticoid receptors and induce sodium and fluid retention, [[hypokalaemia]], [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Therefore, licorice should not be given to patients with a known history of hypertension in doses sufficient to inhibit 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Liquorice and hypertension|journal = Neth J Med|date = April 2005|issn = 0300-2977|pmid = 15869038|pages = 119–20|volume = 63|issue = 4|first = SH|last = van Uum}}</ref>

==Derivatives==
[[File:glycyrrhetinic acid derivatives.svg|thumb|left|150px|Glycyrrhetinic acid derivatives, where R is a variable functional group]]
In glycyrrhetinic acid, the [[functional group]] ('''R''') is a [[hydroxyl]] group. Research in 2005 demonstrated that with a proper functional group a very effective glycyrrhetinic [[artificial sweetener]] can be obtained.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Molecular Design of Sweet Tasting Compounds Based on 3β-Amino-3β-deoxy-18β-glycyrrhetinic Acid: Amido Functionality Eliciting Tremendous Sweetness |journal=Chemistry Letters |year=2005 |first=So |last=Ijichi |author2=Seizo Tamagaki |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=356 |doi=10.1246/cl.2005.356 |url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/cl/34/3/34_356/ |accessdate=2010-09-28 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> When '''R''' is an [[anionic]] NHCO(CH<sub>2</sub>)CO<sub>2</sub>K [[side chain]], the sweetening effect is found to 1200 times that of [[sugar]] (human sensory panel data). A shorter or longer [[spacer (chemistry)|spacer]] reduces the sweetening effect. One explanation is that the [[taste bud]] cell [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] has 1.3 [[nanometer]]s (13 [[angstrom]]s) available for docking with the sweetener molecule. In addition the sweetener molecule requires three [[hydrogen ion|proton]] donor positions of which two reside at the extremities to be able to interact efficiently with the receptor cavity.

A synthetic analog, [[carbenoxolone]], was developed in Britain. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Both glycyrrhetinic acid and carbenoxolone have a modulatory effect on neural signaling through [[gap junction]] channels.

[[Acetoxolone]], the [[acetyl]] derivative of glycyrrhetinic acid, is a drug used in the treatment of [[peptic ulcer]] and [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]].
