'''Propantheline bromide''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) is an [[antimuscarinic]] agent used for the treatment of excessive sweating ([[hyperhidrosis]]), cramps or spasms of the stomach, intestines (gut) or bladder, and involuntary urination ([[enuresis]]). It can also be used to control the symptoms of [[irritable bowel syndrome]] and similar conditions. This agent can also be used for patients who experience intense GI symptoms while tapering off of [[Tricyclic antidepressant|TCAs]].

==Indications==
By relaxing the gut muscle, propantheline can relieve pain in conditions caused by [[spasm]] of the muscle in the gut. Relaxing the smooth muscle in the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] prevents the involuntary spasms that can allow leakage of [[urine]] from the bladder in the condition known as [[enuresis]] (involuntary urination in adults). Propantheline can also be used to treat excessive [[sweating]] because acetylcholine block also reduces secretions such as sweat and [[tears]].

==Adverse effects==
[[Adverse drug reaction|Side effects]] include [[tachycardia]], [[constipation]], [[photophobia|hypersensitivity to light]], dry mouth, and [[urinary retention]].
This can also be prescribed by dentists for certain patients who salivate excessively. By giving this medication it becomes easier to do "dry" dentistry

==Mechanism of action==
Propantheline is one of a group of [[antispasmodic]] medications which work by blocking the action of the chemical messenger [[acetylcholine]], which is produced by nerve cells, to [[muscarinic receptor]]s present in various [[smooth muscle|smooth muscular]] tissues, in places such as the gut, bladder and eye. Normally, the binding of acetylcholine induces involuntary smooth muscular contractions.
