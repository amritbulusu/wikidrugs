'''Testolactone''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]) (brand name '''Teslac''') is a non-selective, irreversible, [[steroid]]al [[aromatase inhibitor]] used as an [[antineoplastic drug]] to treat advanced-stage [[breast cancer]].<ref name="drugbank">[http://www.drugbank.ca/cgi-bin/getCard.cgi?CARD=DB00894.txt Testolactone] at DrugBank.ca</ref><ref name="pmid16766117">{{cite journal |author=Dunkel L |title=Use of aromatase inhibitors to increase final height |journal=Mol.

==Uses==
This drug is mainly used for treating various types of breast cancer in women who have been through menopause or whose ovaries no longer function.<ref name=comparison>[http://www.drugs.com/cdi/testolactone.html Testolactone facts and comparisons at Drugs.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It works by blocking the production of estrogen, which helps prevent the growth of breast cancers that are activated by estrogen. It may also prevent tumor cells from being activated by other hormones.<ref name=comparison/>  It also has been used to postpone precocious puberty because of its ability to block estrogen production.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmh012 | title = Precocious puberty and statural growth | year = 2004 | last1 = Carel | first1 = J.-C. | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 135–47 | pmid = 15073143 | last2 = Lahlou | first2 = N | last3 = Roger | first3 = M | last4 = Chaussain | first4 = JL}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==
The principal action of testolactone is reported to be inhibition of [[aromatase]] activity and the reduction in [[estrogen]] synthesis that follows. Androstenedione, a 19-carbon [[steroid hormone]] produced in the [[adrenal glands]] and the [[gonads]], is where estrone synthesis originates and is the source of estrogen in [[postmenopausal]] women. [[In vitro]] studies report that the aromatase inhibition may be noncompetitive and irreversible, and could possibly account for the persistence of this drug's effect on estrogen synthesis after drug withdrawal.<ref name=drugbank/>

In addition to its activity as an aromatase inhibitor, testolactone also reportedly possesses some anabolic activity and weak androgenic activity via binding to and activation of the [[androgen receptor]].<ref name="LemkeWilliams2012">{{cite book|author1=Thomas L.

==Chemistry==
Testolactone is a synthetic 18-oxasteroid and a D-homo-18-oxo [[structural analog|analogue]] of [[androstenedione]] (androst-4-en-3,17-dione), with a six-membered [[lactone]] [[ring (chemistry)|ring]] in place of the five-membered [[Cyclic compound#Carbocycles|carbocyclic]] D-ring.<ref name="LemkeWilliams2012" />
