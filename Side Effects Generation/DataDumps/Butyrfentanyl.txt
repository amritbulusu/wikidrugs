'''Butyrfentanyl''' or '''butyrylfentanyl''' is a potent short-acting synthetic [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] [[medication|drug]].  It is an [[structural analog|analog]] of [[fentanyl]] with around one quarter of its potency. One of the first mentions of this drug can be found in document written by The College on Problem of Drug Dependence, where it is mentioned as ''N''-butyramide fentanyl analog.<ref name="The College on Problem of Drug Dependence">[http://www.cpdd.vcu.edu/DEC_ARCHIVES/DEC/acrobat/DECindices.pdf The College on Problem of Drug Dependence], Foreword to the Drug Evaluation Committee (DEC) Analgesic, Stimulant, and Depressant Drug Indices</ref> This document also states that the article describing its clinical effects (analgesic studies, μ-, δ-, κ-opioid receptor binding, and ''[[in vitro]]'' measures of drug efficacy, antinociceptive, and narcotic properties) was published in 1987. It is an agonist for the [[μ-opioid receptor]]s.<ref name="Part II">[http://content.lib.utah.edu/utils/getfile/collection/etd1/id/1285/filename/1341.pdf Utilization of a radioreceptor assay for the analysis of fentanyl analogs in urine] Mario Enrique Alburges</ref>

Butyrfentanyl has no current legitimate clinical applications; however, it is being sold as [[designer drug]].<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://jat.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/12/18/jat.bkv138.abstract | title=An Acute Butyr-Fentanyl Fatality: A Case Report with Postmortem Concentrations |author1=Iain M.

Side effects of fentanyl analogs are similar to those of fentanyl itself, which include [[itching]], [[nausea]], and potentially serious [[respiratory depression]] which can be life-threatening. Fentanyl analogs have killed hundreds of people throughout Europe and the former Soviet republics since the most recent resurgence in use began in Estonia in the early 2000s, and novel derivatives continue to appear.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.ijdp.org/article/S0955-3959%2815%2900097-3/abstract | title=Fentanyls: Are we missing the signs?

==Pharmacokinetics==
Butyrfentanyl binds to the opioid receptor. During the studies of [[in vitro]] inhibition of specific [3H] fentanyl binding to the opioid receptor, the order of analogues was: (±)-''cis''-3-methylfentanyl > fentanyl = alpha-methylfentanyl > butyrylfentanyl > benzylfentanyl.<ref name="Part II"/> The studies in inhibition studies on binding affinity achieved the same order of analogues. It means that butyrfentantyl is a less potent opioid-agonist than fentanyl. On the other side, during in vitro studies of cross-reactivity with the fentanyl [[antibody]] between fentanyl and the fentanyl analogs examined, revealed order: fentanyl = butyrylfentanyl > (±)-''cis''-[[3-methylfentanyl]] > benzylfentanyl > alpha-methylfentanyl.<ref name="Part II" /> High cross-reactivity may be the effect of the shape of the molecule - the shape of butyrfentanyl is closest to the original fentanyl molecule, which makes it easy to bind by fentanyl antibodies.

The opioid [[receptor affinity]] of fentanyl and its analogs was determined from their inhibitory potency in a binding assay with [3H] fentanyl as the radioligand. The Ki value for butyrfentanyl was Ki=32 ± 4.1 nM. Comparing to fentanyl's Ki (Ki=1.06 ± 0.15 nM), butyrfentanyl's ability to displace [3H] fentanyl is low and it requires high concentrations of the drug.<ref name="Part II" />

Studies on urinary excretion revealed that almost all of the injected butyrfentanyl was excreted or metabolized within the first 3 h after injection, and only very low concentrations were still detectable after 3 h.<ref name="Part II" /> Urinary concentrations of butyrylfentanyl from animals injected with 15 μg/kg and 45 μg/kg i.v. were measured by two techniques: radioreceptorassay and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry ([[GC/MS]]).

==Legal status==
There is a proposal being discussed by the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) to include butyrfentanyl in Schedule 1 of the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. This will be voted on by member states on the 16th March 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Commission on Narcotic Drugs - Annotated  provisional agenda|url=https://undocs.org/E/CN.7/2017/1|website=undocs.org|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=17 March 2017|language=en|date=23 December 2016|id=E/CN.7/2017/1 |at=p. 10}}</ref>{{update needed|2017|8|17}}

===United Kingdom===
Butyrfentanyl is illegal in the United Kingdom as it is a modification of fentanyl "by replacement of the N-propionyl group by another acyl group".

===United States===
As of May 2016, butyrfentanyl is a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-12/pdf/2016-11219.pdf | title=Schedules of Controlled Substances: Temporary Placement of Butyryl Fentanyl and Beta-Hydroxythiofentanyl into Schedule I | publisher=Drug Enforcement Agency | date=12 May 2016}}</ref>

===China===
As of October 2015, butyrfentanyl is a controlled substance in China.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sfda.gov.cn/WS01/CL0056/130753.html | title=关于印发《非药用类麻醉药品和精神药品列管办法》的通知 | publisher=China Food and Drug Administration | date=27 September 2015 | language=Chinese | accessdate=1 October 2015}}</ref>
