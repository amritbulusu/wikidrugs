'''Butenafine hydrochloride''' is a synthetic [[benzylamine]] [[Antifungal medication|antifungal]], marketed under the trade names '''Mentax''', '''Butop''' (India) and is the active ingredient in '''Lotrimin Ultra.''' It is structurally related to synthetic [[allylamine]] antifungals such as [[terbinafine]].

== Medical uses ==
Butenafine is indicated for the topical treatment of tinea (pityriasis) versicolor due to ''[[Malassezia|Malassezia furfur]]'', as well as [[athlete's foot]] (''Tinea pedis''), [[ringworm]] (''Tinea corporis'') and [[jock itch]] (''Tinea cruris'') due to ''[[Epidermophyton floccosum]]'', ''[[Trichophyton interdigitale|Trichophyton mentagrophytes]]'', ''[[Trichophyton rubrum]]'', and ''[[Trichophyton tonsurans]]''.

It also displays superior activity against ''[[Candida albicans]]'' than terbinafine and [[naftifine]]. Butenafine demonstrates low minimum inhibitory concentrations against ''[[Cryptococcus (fungus)|Cryptococcus]]'' and ''[[Aspergillus]]''.

There is some evidence that it is effective against dermatophyte infections of the toenails, but needs to be applied daily for prolonged periods (at least one year).<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001434.pub2 | title=Topical treatments for fungal infections of the skin and nails of the foot. | year=1996 | journal=Reviews | last1 = Crawford | first1 = Fay}}</ref>

Butenafine is typically available as a 1% topical cream.

==Pharmacology==
Butenafine [[hydrochloride]] is an odorless white crystalline powder that is freely soluble in [[methanol]], [[ethanol]], and [[chloroform]], and slightly soluble in water.

Like the allylamine antifungals, butenafine works by inhibiting the synthesis of [[ergosterol]] by inhibiting [[squalene epoxidase]], an enzyme responsible for the creation of sterols needed in fungal cell membranes. Lacking ergosterol, the cell membranes increase in permeability, allowing their contents to leak out.

== Typical usage ==
For 1% cream:
* for adults and children 12 years and older:
** wash the affected skin with soap and water and dry completely before applying
** apply once a day to affected skin for 2 weeks or as directed by a doctor
** wash hands after each use
* children under 12 years: ask a doctor
