In the United States, deflazacort is also [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]-approved for the treatment of [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]] in people over the age of 5.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Commissioner|first1=Office of the|title=Press Announcements - FDA approves drug to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy|url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm540945.htm|website=www.fda.gov|accessdate=18 February 2017|language=en}}</ref>

== Adverse effects ==
Deflazacort carries the risks common to all [[corticosteroids]], including [[immune suppression]], decreased [[bone density]], and [[endocrine]] insufficiency. In clinical trials, the most common side effects (>10% above placebo) were [[Cushing's]]-like appearance, weight gain, and increased appetite.<ref>http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/208684s000,208685s000lbl.pdf</ref>

== Pharmacology ==
=== Mechanism of action ===
{{see|Glucocorticoid#Mechanism of action}}
Deflazacort is an inactive [[prodrug]] which is [[drug metabolism|metabolized]] rapidly to the active drug 21-desacetyldeflazacort.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 7494809 | year = 1995 | last1 = Möllmann | first1 = H | last2 = Hochhaus | first2 = G | last3 = Rohatagi | first3 = S | last4 = Barth | first4 = J | last5 = Derendorf | first5 = H | title = Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic evaluation of deflazacort in comparison to methylprednisolone and prednisolone | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = 1096–100 | journal = Pharmaceutical Research }}</ref>

=== Relative potency ===
Deflazacort's potency is around 70–90% that of [[prednisone]].<ref name="eMC"/>  A 2017 review found its activity of 7.5&nbsp;mg of deflazacort is approximately equivalent to 25&nbsp;mg [[cortisone]], 20&nbsp;mg [[hydrocortisone]], 5&nbsp;mg of [[prednisolone]] or [[prednisone]], 4&nbsp;mg of [[methylprednisolone]] or [[triamcinolone]], or 0.75&nbsp;mg of [[betamethasone]] or [[dexamethasone]].  The review noted that the drug has a high [[therapeutic index]], being used at initial oral doses ranging from 6 to 90&nbsp;mg, and probably requires a 50% higher dose to induce the same demineralizing effect as prednisolone.  Thus it has "a smaller impact on calcium metabolism than any other synthetic corticosteroid, and therefore shows a lower risk of growth rate retardation in children and of osteoporosis" in the elderly, and comparatively small effects on carbohydrate metabolism, sodium retention, and hypokalemia.<ref>{{cite web|pmc=5216559|title=Deflazacort: therapeutic index, relative potency and equivalent doses versus other corticosteroids|author=Luca Parente|journal=BMC Pharmacol Toxicol.|year=2017|volume=18|issue=1|doi=10.1186/s40360-016-0111-8}}</ref>

== History ==
In January 2015, the FDA granted [[fast track (FDA)|fast track]] status to [[Marathon Pharmaceuticals]] to pursue approval of deflazacort as a potential treatment for [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]], a rare, "progressive and fatal disease" that affects boys.<ref name="chicagotribune_marathon_2015">

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Emflaza (deflazacort) tablets and oral suspension to treat patients age 5 years and older with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a rare genetic disorder that causes progressive muscle deterioration and weakness. Emflaza is a corticosteroid that works by decreasing inflammation and reducing the activity of the immune system.<ref>https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm540945.htm</ref>
