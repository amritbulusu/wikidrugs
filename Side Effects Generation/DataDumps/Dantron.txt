'''Dantron''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]), also known as '''chrysazin''' or '''1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone''', is an [[organic substance]], formally derived from [[anthraquinone]] by the replacement of two [[hydrogen]] atoms by [[hydroxyl]] [[functional group|groups]] (â€“OH).  It is used in some countries as a stimulant [[laxative]].  

It should not be confused with [[ondansetron]], an unrelated drug that was marketed in [[South Africa]] under the [[trade name]] "Dantron".

== Medical uses ==
In the [[United States|USA]], dantron is not used because it is considered to be a [[Carcinogen|carcinogen]].<ref>[http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/eleventh/profiles/s055dant.pdf Danthron substance profile] at the [[National Toxicology Program]] website</ref>

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] it is considered a possible carcinogen and so its licence is restricted to patients who already have a diagnosis of terminal cancer. It is mainly used in [[palliative care]] to counteract the constipating effects of [[opioids]]. Its  [[British Approved Name]] was '''danthron''', but it has now been changed to "dantron", the recommended International Nonproprietary Name.<ref name=BNF>[http://www.bnf.org/ British National Formulary website] (requires free registration)</ref>

== Side effects ==
Dantron has the notable side-effect of causing red-colored urine.
