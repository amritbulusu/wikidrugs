'''Norethisterone''' ('''NET'''), also known as '''norethindrone''', is a [[medication]] that is used in [[combination therapy|combination]] with [[estrogen]] or alone in [[hormonal contraceptive]]s, [[hormone replacement therapy]], and in the treatment of [[gynecological disorder]]s. It is a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]] [[progestogen]] (or a [[progestin]]) of the [[19-nortestosterone]] group and has similar effects to those of natural [[progesterone]], including [[antigonadotropic|suppression of gonadotropin]]s, [[ovulation]] inhibition, and [[decidualization|endometrial transformation]].<ref name="McCuistionKee2014">{{cite book|author1=Linda E.

==Medical uses==
NET is used as a hormonal contraceptive in combination with an estrogen – usually [[ethinylestradiol]] (EE) – in [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]s and alone in [[progestogen-only pill]]s. Aside from its use as a contraceptive, NET can be used to treat [[premenstrual syndrome]], [[dysmenorrhea]], [[menorrhagia]], [[irregular menstruation]], [[menopausal symptom]]s (in combination with estrogen), or to postpone a [[menstruation|period]]. It is also commonly used to help prevent [[uterus|uterine]] [[hemorrhage]] in complicated non-surgical or pre-surgical gynecologic cases and in treating non responsive cyclical [[mastalgia]].

==Contraindications==
High-dose (10&nbsp;mg/day) NET has been associated with [[hepatic veno-occlusive disease]], and because of this adverse effect, NET should not be given to patients undergoing allogeneic [[bone marrow transplantation]], as it has been associated with substantially lower one-year survival post-transplantation.<ref name="Aronson2009">{{cite book|author=Jeffrey K. Aronson|title=Meyler's Side Effects of Endocrine and Metabolic Drugs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BWMeSwVwfTkC&pg=PA217|date=21 February 2009|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-093292-7|pages=217,253,275}}</ref>{{rp|217}}<ref name="pmid9845522">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hägglund H, Remberger M, Klaesson S, Lönnqvist B, Ljungman P, Ringdén O | title = Norethisterone treatment, a major risk-factor for veno-occlusive disease in the liver after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation | journal = Blood | volume = 92 | issue = 12 | pages = 4568–72 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9845522 | doi = | url = }}</ref>

==Side effects==
At contraceptive and hormone replacement dosages (0.35 to 1&nbsp;mg/day), NET has essentially progestogenic [[side effect]]s only. In most clinical studies of NET for contraception or hormone replacement therapy, the drug has been combined with an estrogen, and for this reason, it is difficult to determine which of the side effects were caused by NET and which of them were caused by estrogen in such research. However, NETE, an intramuscularly administered prodrug of NET which is used as a long-acting contraceptive, is used without an estrogen, and hence can be employed as a surrogate for NET in terms of understanding its effects and [[tolerability]]. In clinical studies, the most common side effect with NETE has been [[menstrual disturbance]]s, including [[dysfunctional uterine bleeding|prolonged bleeding or spotting]] and [[amenorrhea]].<ref name="Aronson2009" />{{rp|253}} Other side effects have included periodic [[abdominal bloating]] and [[breast tenderness]], both of which are thought to be due to [[water retention (medicine)|water retention]] and can be relieved with [[diuretic]]s.<ref name="Aronson2009" />{{rp|253}} There has been no association with [[weight gain]], and [[blood pressure]], [[blood clotting]], and [[glucose tolerance]] have all remained normal.<ref name="Aronson2009" />{{rp|253}} However, a decrease in [[HDL cholesterol|{{abbr|HDL|high-density lipoprotein}} cholesterol]] has been observed.<ref name="Aronson2009" />{{rp|253}}

At high dosages (5 to 60&nbsp;mg/day), for instance those used in the treatment of gynecological disorders, NET can cause [[hypogonadism]] due to its [[antigonadotropic]] effects and can have estrogenic and weak androgenic side effects.

===At high dosages===

====Androgenic====
Due to its weak androgenic activity, NET can produce androgenic [[side effect]]s such as [[acne]], [[hirsutism]], and [[voice change]]s of slight severity in some women at high dosages (e.g., 10 to 40&nbsp;mg/day).<ref name="pmid14450719">{{cite journal | vauthors = JACOBSON BD | title = Hazards of norethindrone therapy during pregnancy | journal = Am.

A large clinical study of high to very high oral dosages of NET (10 to 40&nbsp;mg/day) administered for prolonged periods of time (4 to 35 weeks) to prevent [[miscarriage]] in [[pregnancy|pregnant]] women found that 5.5% of the women experienced mild androgenic side effects such as mild [[voice change]]s ([[hoarseness]]), acne, and [[hirsutism]] and that 18.3% of female infants born to the mothers showed, in most cases only slight, [[virilization]] of the [[genital]]s.<ref name="pmid14450719" /> Maternal androgenic symptoms occurred most often in women who received a dosage of NET of 30&nbsp;mg/day or more for a period of 15&nbsp;weeks or longer.<ref name="pmid14450719" /> In the female infants who experienced virilization of the genitals, the sole manifestation in 86.7% of the cases was varied but almost always slight enlargement of the clitoris.<ref name="pmid14450719" /> In the remaining 13.3% of the affected cases, marked clitoral enlargement and partial fusion of the [[labioscrotal swelling|labioscrotal fold]]s occurred.<ref name="pmid14450719" /> The dosages used in these cases were 20 to 40&nbsp;mg/day.<ref name="pmid14450719" />

In a letter to the editor on the topic of virilization caused by high dosages of NETA in women, a physician expressed that they had not observed the "slightest evidence of virilization" and that there had "certainly been no hirsutism nor any voice changes" in 55&nbsp;women with advanced breast cancer that they had treated with 30 to 60&nbsp;mg/day NET for up to six&nbsp;months.<ref name="Curwen1962">{{cite journal|last1=Curwen|first1=S.|title=Virilization with Norethisterone|journal=BMJ|volume=1|issue=5289|year=1962|pages=1415–1415|issn=0959-8138|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.5289.1415-a}}</ref>

====Estrogenic====
NET is weakly estrogenic (via conversion into its [[metabolite]] EE), and for this reason, it has been found at high dosages to be associated with high rates of estrogenic side effects such as [[breast enlargement]] in women and [[gynecomastia]] in men, but also with improvement of [[menopause|menopausal]] [[symptom]]s in postmenopausal women.<ref name="pmid13942007">{{cite journal | vauthors = PAULSEN CA, LEACH RB, LANMAN J, GOLDSTON N, MADDOCK WO, HELLER CG | title = Inherent estrogenicity of norethindrone and norethynodrel: comparison with other synthetic progestins and progesterone | journal = J.

==Interactions==
[[5α-Reductase]] plays an important role in the [[metabolism]] of NET, and [[5α-reductase inhibitor]]s such as [[finasteride]] and [[dutasteride]] can inhibit its metabolism.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

This is the case for norethisterone (Fig. 1, 34), a synthetic 19-nor-17α-ethynyl testosterone derivative, which also undergoes enzyme-mediated 5α-reduction and exerts potent androgenic effects in target organs. 5α-Reduced norethisterone displays a higher AR binding but shows a significantly lower androgenic potency than unchanged norethisterone [102,103].}}</ref><ref name="pmid9182866">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lemus AE, Enríquez J, García GA, Grillasca I, Pérez-Palacios G | title = 5alpha-reduction of norethisterone enhances its binding affinity for androgen receptors but diminishes its androgenic potency | journal = J.

NET (0.5 to 3&nbsp;mg/day) has been found to dose-dependently decrease circulating SHBG levels, which is a common property of androgens and is due to AR-mediated suppression of hepatic SHBG production.<ref name="pmid9494772">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuhnz W, Heuner A, Hümpel M, Seifert W, Michaelis K | title = In vivo conversion of norethisterone and norethisterone acetate to ethinyl etradiol in postmenopausal women | journal = Contraception | volume = 56 | issue = 6 | pages = 379–85 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9494772 | doi = 10.1016/s0010-7824(97)00174-1| url = | quote = [...] it has been shown that the repeated oral administration of NET at doses of 0.5 to 3.0 mg to fertile women caused a dose related decrease in the serum levels of SHBG.24 It should be borne in mind that, besides its progestational activity, NET is also characterized by a marked androgenic partial activity, which has a suppressive effect on the synthesis of SHBG and therefore compensates the effects of an additional exposure to EE, on the liver.}}</ref> The drug also has estrogenic activity, and estrogens are known to increase SHBG hepatic production and circulating levels, so it would appear that the androgenic activity of NET overpowers its estrogenic activity in this regard.<ref name="pmid9494772" />

===Estrogenic activity===
NET binds to the ERs, the [[ERα]] and the [[ERβ]], with 0.07% and 0.01% of the [[relative binding affinity]] of [[estradiol]].<ref name="pmid9048584">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuiper GG, Carlsson B, Grandien K, Enmark E, Häggblad J, Nilsson S, Gustafsson JA | title = Comparison of the ligand binding specificity and transcript tissue distribution of estrogen receptors alpha and beta | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 138 | issue = 3 | pages = 863–70 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9048584 | doi = 10.1210/endo.138.3.4979 | url = }}</ref> Due to these very low relative affinities, it is essentially inactive itself as a [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] of the ERs at clinical concentrations.<ref name="pmid16112947" /> However, NET has been found to be a [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] for [[aromatase]] and is converted in the [[liver]] to a small extent (0.35%) to the highly [[potency (pharmacology)|potent]] estrogen EE, and for this reason, unlike most other progestins, NET has some estrogenic activity.<ref name="pmid16112947" /> However, with typical dosages of NET used in [[oral contraceptive]]s (0.5 to 1&nbsp;mg), the levels of EE produced are low, and it has been said that they are probably without clinical relevance.<ref name="pmid16112947" /> Conversely, doses of 5 and 10&nbsp;mg of NET, which are used in the treatment of [[gynecological disorder]]s, are converted at rates of 0.7% and 1.0% and produce levels of EE that correspond to those produced by 30 and 60&nbsp;μg dosages of EE, respectively.<ref name="pmid12215716" /><ref name="pmid16112947" /> The levels of EE formed by 0.5 and 1&nbsp;mg of NET have been calculated and estimated based on higher dosages as corresponding to 2 and 10&nbsp;μg dosages of EE, respectively.<ref name="pmid12215716" />

===Neurosteroid activity===
Like [[progesterone]] and [[testosterone]], NET is metabolized into 3,5-tetrahydro [[metabolite]]s.<ref name="GiattiMelcangi2016">{{cite journal|last1=Giatti|first1=Silvia|last2=Melcangi|first2=Roberto Cosimo|last3=Pesaresi|first3=Marzia|title=The other side of progestins: effects in the brain|journal=Journal of Molecular Endocrinology|volume=57|issue=2|year=2016|pages=R109–R126|issn=0952-5041|doi=10.1530/JME-16-0061}}</ref> Whether these metabolites of NET interact with the [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor]] similarly to the 3,5-tetrahydro metabolites of progesterone and testosterone like [[allopregnanolone]] and [[3α-androstanediol]], respectively, is a topic that does not appear to have been studied and hence requires clarification.<ref name="GiattiMelcangi2016" />

===Steroidogenesis inhibition===

====Inhibition of 5α-reductase====
NET is a substrate for and is known to be an [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] of [[5α-reductase]], with 4.4% and 20.1% inhibition at 0.1 and 1&nbsp;μM, respectively.<ref name="pmid16112947" /> However, therapeutic concentrations of NET are in the low [[nanomolar]] range, so this action may not be clinically relevant at typical dosages.<ref name="pmid16112947" />

====Inhibition of aromatase====
NET and its major active metabolite 5α-DHNET have been found to act as [[irreversible inhibition|irreversible]] [[aromatase inhibitor]]s (K<sub>i</sub> = 1.7&nbsp;μM and 9.0&nbsp;μM, respectively).<ref name="pmid8205267">{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamamoto T, Tamura T, Kitawaki J, Osawa Y, Okada H | title = Suicide inactivation of aromatase in human placenta and uterine leiomyoma by 5 alpha-dihydronorethindrone, a metabolite of norethindrone, and its effect on steroid-producing enzymes | journal = Eur.

===Other activities===

====Inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes====
NET is a very weak inhibitor of [[CYP2C9]] and [[CYP3A4]] ([[IC50|IC<sub>50</sub>]] = 46&nbsp;μM and 51&nbsp;μM, respectively), but these actions require very high concentrations of NET that are far above therapeutic circulating levels (which are in the nanomolar range) and hence are probably not clinically relevant.<ref name="pmid16112947" />

====Vasodilatory activity====
NET and some of its 5α-reduced metabolites have been found to produce [[vasodilator|vasodilating]] effects in animals that are independent of [[sex steroid receptor]]s and hence appear to be non-genomic in mechanism.<ref name="pmid12954372">{{cite journal | vauthors = Perusquía M, Villalón CM, Navarrete E, García GA, Pérez-Palacios G, Lemus AE | title = Vasodilating effect of norethisterone and its 5 alpha metabolites: a novel nongenomic action | journal = Eur.

==Pharmacokinetics==

===Absorption===
The [[oral administration|oral]] [[bioavailability]] of NET is between 47 to 73%, with a mean oral bioavailability of 64%.<ref name="pmid12215716" /> [[Micronization]] has been found to significantly improve the oral bioavailability of NET by increasing [[intestinal]] [[absorption (pharmacokinetics)|absorption]] and reducing [[intestinal]] [[metabolism]].<ref name="pmid16112947" /> A single 2&nbsp;mg oral dose of NET has been found to result in peak circulating levels of the drug of 12&nbsp;ng/mL (40&nbsp;nmol/L), whereas a single 1&nbsp;mg oral dose of NET in combination with 2&nbsp;mg estradiol resulted in peak levels of NET of 8.5&nbsp;ng/mL (29&nbsp;nmol/L) one-hour post-administration.<ref name="pmid16112947" />

===Distribution===
NET is 61% bound to [[human serum albumin|albumin]] and 36% bound to SHBG in the blood.<ref name="pmid16112947" />

===Metabolism===
NET has a [[terminal half-life]] of 5.2 to 12.8 hours, with a mean terminal half-life of 8.0 hours.<ref name="pmid12215716" /> The [[metabolism]] of NET is very similar to that of testosterone (and nandrolone) and is mainly via reduction of the Δ<sup>4</sup> [[double bond]] to 5α- and 5β-dihydro-NET, which is followed by the reduction of the C3 [[ketone|keto]] [[functional group|group]] to the four [[isomer]]s of 3,5-tetrahydro-NET.<ref name="pmid16112947" /> These [[biotransformation|transformation]]s are catalyzed by [[5α-reductase|5α-]] and [[5β-reductase]] and [[3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase|3α-]] and [[3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]] both in the [[liver]] and in extrahepatic tissues such as the [[pituitary gland]], [[uterus]], [[prostate gland]], [[vagina]], and [[breast]].<ref name="pmid11162927">{{cite journal | vauthors = Schoonen WG, Deckers GH, de Gooijer ME, de Ries R, Kloosterboer HJ | title = Hormonal properties of norethisterone, 7α-methyl-norethisterone and their derivatives | journal = J.

===Synthesis===

====Synthesis 1====
[[File:Norethisterone synthesis.svg|450px|right|thumb|Norethisterone synthesis:<ref name=Djerassi/><ref name=Colton>Frank B. Colton, {{US patent|2,655,518}} (1952 to [[G.D. Searle, LLC|Searle]] & Co).</ref>]]
Estradiol methyl ether ('''1''', EME) is partially reduced to the 1,5-diene ('''2''') as also occurs for the first step in the synthesis of nandrolone. [[Oppenauer oxidation]] then transforms the 17β alcohol into a ketone functionality ('''3'''). This is then reacted with metal [[acetylide]] into the corresponding 17α-[[ethynyl]] compound ('''4'''). Hydrolysis of the enolether under mild conditions leads directly to ('''5'''),<ref name=Colton/> which appears to be [[noretynodrel]] (although Lednicer states that it is "etynodrel" in his book (which may be a synonym [[etynodiol]]). Etynodrel is with a [[chlorine]] atom attached.) an orally active progestin. This is the progestogen component of the first [[oral contraceptive]] to be offered for sale (i.e., Enovid). Treatment of the ethynyl enol ether with strong acid leads to NET ('''6''').<ref name=Djerassi/>

In practice, these and all other combined oral contraceptives are mixtures of 1–2% EE or [[mestranol]] and an oral [[progestin]]. It has been speculated that the discovery of the necessity of estrogen in addition to progestin for contraceptive efficacy is due to the presence of a small amount of unreduced EME ('''1''') in early batches of '''2'''. This when subjected to oxidation and [[alkynylation|ethynylation]], would of course lead to mestranol ('''3'''). In any event, the need for the presence of estrogen in the mixture is now well established experimentally.

NET is made from [[estr-4-ene-3,17-dione]] (bolandione), which in turn is synthesized by partial reduction of the aromatic region of the 3-O-methyl ether of [[estrone]] with lithium in liquid ammonia, and simultaneously of the keto group at C<sub>17</sub> to a hydroxy group, which is then oxidized back to a keto group by [[chromium trioxide]] in [[acetic acid]]. The congugated  C<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>5</sub> olefin and the carbonyl group at C<sub>3</sub> is then transformed to dienol ethyl ether using [[ethyl orthoformate]]. The obtained product is ethynylated by [[acetylene]] in the presence of [[potassium tert-butoxide]]. After [[HCl]] hydrolysis of the formed O-potassium derivative, during which the enol ether is also hydrolyzed, and the remaining double bond is shifted, the desired NET is obtained.
