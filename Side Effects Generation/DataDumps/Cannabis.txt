'''''Cannabis''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|n|ə|b|ɪ|s}}) is a [[genus]] of [[flowering plant]] in the family [[Cannabaceae]]. The number of species within the genus is disputed. Three species may be recognized, ''[[Cannabis sativa]]'', ''[[Cannabis indica]]'' and ''[[Cannabis ruderalis]]''; ''C. ruderalis'' may be included within ''C. sativa''; or all three may be treated as subspecies of a single species, ''C. sativa''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Classification Report|url=https://plants.usda.gov/java/ClassificationServlet?source=display&classid=CASA3|publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]|accessdate=13 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Indica, Sativa, Ruderalis – Did We Get It All Wrong?|url=http://theleafonline.com/c/science/2015/01/indica-sativa-ruderalis-get-wrong/|website=The Leaf Online|accessdate=13 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://npgsweb.ars-grin.gov/gringlobal/taxonomylist.aspx?category=species&type=genus&value=Cannabis&id=2034 |title=Species of ''Cannabis'' |website=GRIN Taxonomy |accessdate=13 February 2017}}</ref><ref name=GuyWhittle2004/>  The genus is [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] to [[central Asia]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Marijuana and the Cannabinoids|last=A.

Cannabis has long been used for [[hemp]] fibre, for [[hemp oil]]s, [[medical cannabis|for medicinal purposes]], and [[Cannabis (drug)|as a recreational drug]]. Industrial hemp products are made from cannabis plants selected to produce an abundance of fiber. To satisfy the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs|UN Narcotics Convention]], some cannabis strains have been bred to produce minimal levels of [[tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC), the principal [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive constituent]].  Many plants have been selectively bred to produce a maximum of THC ([[cannabinoid]]s), which is obtained by [[wikt:cure|curing]] the flowers. Various compounds, including [[hashish]] and [[hash oil]], are extracted from the plant.<ref name=erowid>Erowid. 2006. [http://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_basics.shtml Cannabis Basics].

==Description==
[[File:Cannabis plants in front of the Dhaulagiri summit.jpg|thumb|''Cannabis'' growing as [[weed]]s at the foot of [[Dhaulagiri]], [[Nepal]].]]
[[File:Empty plot for Afghan embassy.jpg|thumb|A [[thicket]] of wild ''cannabis'' in [[Islamabad]], [[Pakistan]].]]
Cannabis is an [[Annual plant|annual]], [[dioecious]], [[Flowering plant|flowering]] [[herb]]. The [[leaf|leaves]] are [[Leaf shape|palmately compound or digitate]], with [[Leaf margin|serrate]] [[leaflet (botany)|leaflets]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://waynesword.palomar.edu/termlf1.htm|title=Leaf Terminology (Part 1)|publisher=Waynesword.palomar.edu|accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref> The first pair of leaves usually have a single leaflet, the number gradually increasing up to a maximum of about thirteen leaflets per leaf (usually seven or nine), depending on variety and growing conditions. At the top of a flowering plant, this number again diminishes to a single leaflet per leaf. The lower leaf pairs usually occur in an opposite [[Phyllotaxis|leaf arrangement]] and the upper leaf pairs in an alternate arrangement on the main stem of a mature plant.

The leaves have a peculiar and diagnostic venation pattern that enables persons poorly familiar with the plant to distinguish a cannabis leaf from unrelated species that have confusingly similar leaves (see illustration). As is common in serrated leaves, each serration has a central vein extending to its tip. However, the serration vein originates from lower down the central vein of the leaflet, typically opposite to the position of, not the first notch down, but the next notch. This means that on its way from the midrib of the leaflet to the point of the serration, the vein serving the tip of the serration passes close by the intervening notch. Sometimes the vein will actually pass tangent to the notch, but often it will pass by at a small distance, and when that happens a spur vein (occasionally a pair of such spur veins) branches off and joins the leaf margin at the deepest point of the notch. This venation pattern varies slightly among varieties, but in general it enables one to tell ''Cannabis'' leaves from superficially similar leaves without difficulty and without special equipment. Tiny samples of ''Cannabis'' plants also can be identified with precision by microscopic examination of leaf cells and similar features, but that requires special expertise and equipment.<ref name="WattPP">Watt, John Mitchell; Breyer-Brandwijk, Maria Gerdina: ''The Medicinal and Poisonous Plants of Southern and Eastern Africa'' 2nd ed Pub. E & S Livingstone 1962</ref>

The plant is believed to have originated in the mountainous regions northwest of the Himalayas.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} It is also known as hemp, although this term is often used to refer only to varieties of ''Cannabis'' cultivated for non-drug use.

=== Reproduction ===
''Cannabis'' normally has [[Plant sexuality#Terminology|imperfect]] [[flowers]], with [[Stamen|staminate]] "male" and [[pistil]]late "female" flowers occurring on separate plants.<ref name="lebel1997">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1360-1385(97)01012-1|title=Genetics of sex determination in flowering plants|year=1997|last1=Lebel-Hardenack|first1=Sabine|last2=Grant|first2=Sarah R.|journal=Trends in Plant Science|volume=2|issue=4|pages=130–6}}</ref> It is not unusual, however, for individual plants to bear both male and female flowers.<ref name="moliterni2005">{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10681-004-4758-7|title=The sexual differentiation of Cannabis sativa L.: A morphological and molecular study|year=2004|last1=Moliterni|first1=V.

=== Biochemistry and drugs ===
''Cannabis'' plants produce a group of chemicals called cannabinoids, which produce mental and physical effects when consumed.

[[Cannabinoids]], [[terpenoids]], and other compounds are secreted by glandular [[trichomes]] that occur most abundantly on the floral [[sepal|calyxes]] and [[bract]]s of female plants.<ref name="mahlberg2001a">{{cite journal |author1=Mahlberg Paul G. |author2=Soo Kim Eun | year = 2001 | title = THC (tetrahyrdocannabinol) accumulation in glands of ''Cannabis'' (Cannabaceae) | url = http://www.hempreport.com/issues/17/malbody17.html | journal = The Hemp Report | volume = 3 | issue = 17 }}</ref> As a drug it usually comes in the form of dried flower buds ([[cannabis (drug)#marijuana|marijuana]]), [[resin]] ([[hashish]]), or various extracts collectively known as [[hashish oil]].<ref name=erowid/> In the early 20th century, it became illegal in most of the world to cultivate or possess ''Cannabis'' for sale or personal use.

===Taxonomy===
[[File:Cannabis sativa leaf diagnostic venation 2012 01 23 0829 c.jpg|thumb|Underside of ''[[Cannabis sativa]]'' leaf, showing diagnostic venation]]
The genus ''Cannabis'' was formerly placed in the [[Urtica|Nettle]] ([[Urticaceae]]) or [[Mulberry]] ([[Moraceae]]) family, and later, along with the ''[[Humulus]]'' genus ([[hops]]), in a separate family, the [[Hemp]] family (Cannabaceae [[sensu stricto]]).<ref name=schultes2001a>Schultes, R.

Whether the drug and non-drug, cultivated and wild types of ''Cannabis'' constitute a single, highly variable species, or the genus is polytypic with more than one species, has been a subject of debate for well over two centuries.

===History of cannabis===
''Cannabis sativa'' appears naturally in many tropical and humid parts of the world.  Its use as a mind-altering drug has been documented by archaeological finds in prehistoric societies in Eurasia and Africa.<ref>Ernest Abel, Marijuana, The First 12,000 years (Plenum Press, New York 1980)</ref>

The oldest written record of cannabis usage is the Greek historian [[Herodotus]]'s reference to the central Eurasian [[Scythians]] taking cannabis steam baths.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Butrica James L | year = 2002 | title = The Medical Use of Cannabis Among the Greeks and Romans | url = | journal = Journal of Cannabis Therapeutics | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 51–70 | doi=10.1300/j175v02n02_04}}</ref> His (c. 440 BCE) [[Histories (Herodotus)|''Histories'']] records, "The Scythians, as I said, take some of this hemp-seed [presumably, flowers], and, creeping under the felt coverings, throw it upon the red-hot stones; immediately it smokes, and gives out such a vapour as no Grecian vapour-bath can exceed; the Scyths, delighted, shout for joy."<ref>{{cite web|author1=Herodotus (translated by George Rawlinson)|title=The History of Herodotus|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.4.iv.html|website=The Internet Classics Archive|publisher=Daniel C.

===Early classifications===
[[File:Cannab2 new.png|thumb|upright|Relative size of varieties of ''Cannabis'']]

The ''Cannabis'' genus was first [[Scientific classification|classified]] using the "modern" system of taxonomic [[Binomial nomenclature|nomenclature]] by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1753, who devised the system still in use for the naming of species.<ref name="linnaeus1753">Linnaeus, C. 1753. ''Species Plantarum'' '''2''': 1027. Salvius, Stockholm. [Facsimile edition, 1957–1959. Ray Society, London, U.K.]</ref> He considered the genus to be monotypic, having just a single species that he named ''Cannabis sativa'' L. (L. stands for Linnaeus, and indicates the authority who first named the species). Linnaeus was familiar with European hemp, which was widely cultivated at the time. In 1785, noted evolutionary biologist [[Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck]] published a description of a second species of ''Cannabis'', which he named ''Cannabis indica'' Lam.<ref name="lamarck1785">de Lamarck, J.B. 1785. ''Encyclopédie Méthodique de Botanique'', vol. 1, pt. 2. Paris, France, pp. 694–695</ref> Lamarck based his description of the newly named species on plant specimens collected in India. He described ''C. indica'' as having poorer fiber quality than ''C. sativa'', but greater utility as an [[Psychoactive drug|inebriant]]. Additional ''Cannabis'' species were proposed in the 19th century, including strains from China and Vietnam (Indo-China) assigned the names ''Cannabis chinensis'' Delile, and ''Cannabis gigantea'' Delile ex Vilmorin.<ref name="small1976a">{{cite journal|first1=Ernest|last1=Small|first2=Arthur|last2=Cronquist|year=1976|title=A Practical and Natural Taxonomy for Cannabis|journal=Taxon|volume=25|issue=4|pages=405–35|jstor=1220524|doi=10.2307/1220524}}</ref> However, many taxonomists found these putative species difficult to distinguish. In the early 20th century, the single-species concept was still widely accepted, except in the [[Soviet Union]] where ''Cannabis'' continued to be the subject of active taxonomic study. The name ''Cannabis indica'' was listed in various [[Pharmacopoeia]]s, and was widely used to designate ''Cannabis'' suitable for the manufacture of medicinal preparations.<ref name="winek1977">{{cite journal|doi=10.3109/15563657708987969|title=Some Historical Aspects of Marijuana|year=1977|last1=Winek|first1=Charles L.|journal=Clinical Toxicology|volume=10|issue=2|pages=243–53|pmid=322936}}</ref>

===20th century===
[[File:Cannabis ruderalis.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Cannabis ruderalis]]'']]
In 1924, Russian botanist D.E. Janichevsky concluded that [[ruderal]] ''Cannabis'' in central Russia is either a variety of ''C. sativa'' or a separate species, and proposed ''C. sativa'' L. var. ''ruderalis'' Janisch, and ''Cannabis ruderalis'' Janisch, as alternative names.<ref name=small1975b/> In 1929, renowned plant explorer [[Nikolai Vavilov]] assigned wild or feral populations of ''Cannabis'' in Afghanistan to ''C. indica'' Lam. var.

In the 1970s, the taxonomic classification of ''Cannabis'' took on added significance in North America. Laws prohibiting ''Cannabis'' in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] specifically named products of ''C. sativa'' as prohibited materials. Enterprising attorneys for the defense in a few drug busts argued that the seized ''Cannabis'' material may not have been ''C. sativa'', and was therefore not prohibited by law. Attorneys on both sides recruited botanists to provide expert testimony. Among those testifying for the prosecution was Dr. Ernest Small, while [[Richard E. Schultes|Dr. Richard E.

===Popular usage===
The scientific debate regarding taxonomy has had little effect on the terminology in widespread use among cultivators and users of drug-type ''Cannabis''. ''Cannabis'' aficionados recognize three distinct types based on such factors as morphology, [[Range (biology)|native range]], aroma, and subjective psychoactive characteristics. ''Sativa'' is the most widespread variety, which is usually tall, laxly branched, and found in warm lowland regions. ''Indica'' designates shorter, bushier plants adapted to cooler climates and highland environments. ''Ruderalis'' is the informal name for the short plants that grow wild in Europe and central Asia.

Breeders, seed companies, and cultivators of drug type ''Cannabis'' often describe the ancestry or gross [[phenotype|phenotypic]] characteristics of [[cultivar]]s by categorizing them as "pure indica", "mostly indica", "indica/sativa", "mostly sativa", or "pure sativa".

==Uses==
''Cannabis'' is used for a wide variety of purposes.

The psychoactive effects of ''cannabis'' are known to have a triphasic nature. Primary psychoactive effects include a state of relaxation, and to a lesser degree, euphoria from its main psychoactive compound, [[tetrahydrocannabinol]]. Secondary psychoactive effects, such as a facility for philosophical thinking, [[introspection]] and [[metacognition]] have been reported among cases of [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] and [[paranoia]].<ref name="erowid.org">{{cite web|author=Cannabis|url=http://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_effects.shtml|title=Erowid Cannabis (Marijuana) Vault : Effects|publisher=Erowid.org|accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref> Finally, the tertiary psychoactive effects of the drug cannabis, can include an increase in heart rate and hunger, believed to be caused by [[11-Hydroxy-THC|11-OH-THC]], a psychoactive metabolite of [[THC]] produced in the [[liver]].

The term ''hemp'' is used to name the durable soft fiber from the ''Cannabis'' [[plant stem]] (stalk). ''Cannabis sativa'' cultivars are used for fibers due to their long stems; Sativa varieties may grow more than six metres tall. However, ''hemp'' can refer to any industrial or foodstuff product that is not intended for use as a drug. Many countries regulate limits for psychoactive compound ([[THC]]) concentrations in products labeled as hemp.

Cannabis for industrial uses is valuable in tens of thousands of commercial products, especially as fibre<ref name="naihc.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.naihc.org/hemp_information/hemp_facts.html|title=Hemp Facts|publisher=Naihc.org|accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref> ranging from [[paper]], [[Rope|cordage]], [[Hemp#Composite materials|construction material]] and textiles in general, to [[clothing]].

As a result of intensive selection in cultivation, ''Cannabis'' exhibits many sexual phenotypes that can be described in terms of the ratio of female to male flowers occurring in the individual, or typical in the cultivar.<ref name="truta2002a">{{cite journal |pmid=12441630 |year=2002 |last1=Truţa |first1=E |last2=Gille |first2=E |last3=Tóth |first3=E|last4=Maniu|first4=M|title=Biochemical differences in Cannabis sativa L. Depending on sexual phenotype |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=451–62|journal=Journal of applied genetics}}</ref> Dioecious varieties are preferred for drug production, where the female flowers are used. Dioecious varieties are also preferred for textile fiber production, whereas monoecious varieties are preferred for pulp and paper production. It has been suggested that the presence of monoecy can be used to differentiate licit crops of monoecious hemp from illicit drug crops.<ref name="mignoni1999"/> However, ''sativa'' strains often produce monoecious individuals, probably as a result of inbreeding.

===Sex determination===
''Cannabis'' has been described as having one of the most complicated mechanisms of [[Sex-determination system|sex determination]] among the dioecious plants.<ref name="truta2002a"/> Many models have been proposed to explain sex determination in ''Cannabis''.

Based on studies of sex reversal in [[hemp]], it was first reported by K. Hirata in 1924 that an [[XY sex-determination system]] is present.<ref name="hirata1924"/> At the time, the XY system was the only known system of sex determination. The [[X0 sex-determination system|X:A system]] was first described in Drosophila spp in 1925.<ref name="bridges1925">{{cite journal|first=Calvin B.|last=Bridges|year=1925|title=Sex in Relation to Chromosomes and Genes|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=59|issue=661|pages=127–37|jstor=2456354|doi=10.1086/280023}}</ref> Soon thereafter, Schaffner disputed Hirata's interpretation,<ref name="schaffner1929">{{cite journal|hdl=1811/2398|last=Schaffner|first=John H.|year=1929|title=Heredity and sex|journal=Ohio Journal of Science|volume=29|issue=1|pages=289–300}}</ref> and published results from his own studies of sex reversal in hemp, concluding that an X:A system was in use and that furthermore sex was strongly influenced by environmental conditions.<ref name="schaffner1931"/>

Since then, many different types of sex determination systems have been discovered, particularly in plants.<ref name="ainsworth2000"/> Dioecy is relatively uncommon in the plant kingdom, and a very low percentage of dioecious plant species have been determined to use the XY system. In most cases where the XY system is found it is believed to have evolved recently and independently.<ref name="negrutiu2001">{{cite journal|pmid=11743084|year=2001|last1=Negrutiu|first1=I|last2=Vyskot|first2=B|last3=Barbacar|first3=N|last4=Georgiev|first4=S|last5=Moneger|first5=F|title=Dioecious plants.

Since the 1920s, a number of sex determination models have been proposed for ''Cannabis''. Ainsworth describes sex determination in the genus as using "an X/autosome dosage type".<ref name="ainsworth2000"/>

The question of whether heteromorphic sex chromosomes are indeed present is most conveniently answered if such chromosomes were clearly visible in a [[karyotype]]. ''Cannabis'' was one of the first plant species to be karyotyped; however, this was in a period when karyotype preparation was primitive by modern standards (see [[Cytogenetics#History|History of Cytogenetics]]). Heteromorphic sex chromosomes were reported to occur in staminate individuals of dioecious "Kentucky" hemp, but were not found in pistillate individuals of the same variety. Dioecious "Kentucky" hemp was assumed to use an XY mechanism. Heterosomes were not observed in analyzed individuals of monoecious "Kentucky" hemp, nor in an unidentified German cultivar. These varieties were assumed to have sex chromosome composition XX.<ref name="menzel1964">{{cite journal|first=Margaret Y.|last=Menzel|year=1964|title=Meiotic Chromosomes of Monoecious Kentucky Hemp (Cannabis sativa)|journal=Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club|volume=91|issue=3|pages=193–205|jstor=2483524|doi=10.2307/2483524}}</ref> According to other researchers, no modern karyotype of ''Cannabis'' had been published as of 1996.<ref name="hong1996a">{{cite journal|first1=Shao|last1=Hong|first2=Robert C.|last2=Clarke|year=1996|url=http://www.hempfood.com/IHA/iha03207.html|title=Taxonomic studies of Cannabis in China|journal=Journal of the International Hemp Association|volume=3|issue=2|pages=55–60}}</ref> Proponents of the XY system state that [[Y chromosome]] is slightly larger than the X, but difficult to differentiate cytologically.<ref name="peil2003">{{cite journal |pmid=12835935 |year=2003 |last1=Peil |first1=A |last2=Flachowsky |first2=H |last3=Schumann|first3=E|last4=Weber|first4=WE|title=Sex-linked AFLP markers indicate a pseudoautosomal region in hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) |volume=107 |issue=1 |pages=102–9 |doi=10.1007/s00122-003-1212-5 |journal=Theoretical and Applied Genetics}}</ref>
