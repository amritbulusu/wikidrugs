'''Tripelennamine''', sold under the brand name '''Pyribenzamine''' by [[Novartis]], is a drug that is used as an [[antipruritic]] and [[first-generation antihistamine|first-generation]] [[antihistamine]]. It can be used in the treatment of [[asthma]], [[hay fever]], [[rhinitis]] and [[urticaria]], but is now less common as it has been replaced by newer antihistamines.

==Medical uses==
Where and when it is/was in common use, tripelennamine is used much like other mildly-anticholinergic antihistamines for treating conditions of the upper respiratory tract arising from illnesses and hay fever. It can be used alone or in combination with other agents to have the desired effect. Cough medicine of the general formula tripelennamine + codeine/dihydrocodine/hydrocodone ± expectorant ± decongestant(s) is quite popular where available. One example is the line of Pyribenzamine Cough Syrups which contains codeine and with and without decongestants listed in the 1978 Physicians' Desk Reference; the codeine-tripelennamine synergy is well-known and does make such mixtures more useful for their intended purposes.

==Side effects==
Tripelennamine is mildly [[sedative|sedating]]. Other side effects can include irritation, [[dry mouth]], [[nausea]], and [[dizziness]].

==Pharmacology==
Tripelennamine acts primarily as an [[antihistamine]], or [[H1 receptor|H<sub>1</sub>]] [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]]. It has little to no [[anticholinergic]] activity.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} In addition to its antihistamine properties, tripelennamine also acts as a weak [[serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor]] (SNDRI).<ref name="pmid7513381">{{cite journal |vauthors=Oishi R, Shishido S, Yamori M, Saeki K | title = Comparison of the effects of eleven histamine H1-receptor antagonists on monoamine turnover in the mouse brain | journal = Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology | volume = 349 | issue = 2 | pages = 140–4 |date=February 1994 | pmid = 7513381 | doi = 10.1007/bf00169830| url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid8791174">{{cite journal|date=May 1996|title=Potentiation of L-dopa-induced behavioral excitement by histamine H1-receptor antagonists in mice|url=http://joi.jlc.jst.go.jp/JST.Journalarchive/jphs1951/71.81?from=PubMed|journal=Japanese Journal of Pharmacology|volume=71|issue=1|pages=81–4|doi=10.1254/jjp.71.81|pmid=8791174|vauthors=Sato T, Suemaru K, Matsunaga K, Hamaoka S, Gomita Y, Oishi R }}</ref><ref name="pmid10420168">{{cite journal |vauthors=Yeh SY, Dersch C, Rothman R, Cadet JL | title = Effects of antihistamines on 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-induced depletion of serotonin in rats | journal = Synapse | volume = 33 | issue = 3 | pages = 207–17 |date=September 1999 | pmid = 10420168 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2396(19990901)33:3<207::AID-SYN5>3.0.CO;2-8 | url = }}</ref> Because of its SRI properties, tripelennamine was used as the basis for the development of the [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SSRI) [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac).<ref name="urlLet them eat Prozac: the unhealthy ... - Google Books">{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5w64WC_-jbMC&lpg=PP1&dq=let%20them%20eat%20prozac&pg=RA1-PA295 | title = Let them eat Prozac: the unhealthy ... - Google Books | work = | accessdate = | isbn = 978-0-8147-3669-2 | author1 = ), David Healy (MRC Psych | date = January 2004 }}</ref>

==History==
Tripelennamine was first synthesized in 1946 by [[Carl Djerassi]], working in the laboratory of Charles Huttrer at [[Novartis|Ciba]], shortly after Djerassi got his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S]]. It was his first [[patent]].
