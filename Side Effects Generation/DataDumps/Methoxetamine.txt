==Chemistry==
[[File:Arylcyclohexylamines.png|thumb|left|350px|Methoxetamine and related arylcyclohexylamines.]]

MXE is an [[arylcyclohexylamine]]. It is a [[chemical derivative|derivative]] of [[eticyclidine]] (PCE) and [[3-methoxyeticyclidine]] (3-MeO-PCE) and is also known as 3-methoxy-2'-oxo-PCE. It is closely related structurally to [[ketamine]], and more distantly to PCP.

MXE hydrochloride is soluble in ethanol up to 10&nbsp;mg/ml at 25&nbsp;°C.<ref>https://www.caymanchem.com/msdss/11139m.pdf</ref>

===Detection in body fluids===
A forensic standard of MXE is available, and the compound has been posted on the Forendex website of potential drugs of abuse.<ref>Southern Association of Forensic Scientists http://forendex.southernforensic.org/index.php/detail/index/602</ref>

==History==
The qualitative effects of MXE were first described online in May 2010 and the compound became commercially available on a small scale in September 2010,<ref name=emcdda/><ref name="Morris"/> by November use and sale of the MXE had increased enough for it to be formally identified by the [[European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction]]. By July 2011, the EMCDDA had identified 58 websites selling the compound at a cost of 145–195&nbsp;euros for 10&nbsp;grams.<ref>{{ cite report | url = http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_143801_EN_SnapshotSummary.pdf | title = Online sales of new psychoactive substances/‘legalhighs’: Summary of results from the 2011 multilingual snapshots | publisher = European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction | date = 2011-11-15 | accessdate = 2012-01-23 }}</ref> MXE remains popular despite bans in many countries.

====United Kingdom====
Prior to March 2012, MXE was not controlled by the UK's [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971|Misuse of Drugs Act]].<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/health-alert-over-drug-sold-as-safe-ketamine-6804824.html | author = McPherson, P. | title = Health alert over drug sold as 'safe ketamine' | publisher = The Independent | date = 2012-02-13 | accessdate = 2012-02-18 | location=London}}</ref> In March 2012, the [[Home Office]] referred MXE to the [[Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs]] for possible temporary controlling under the powers given in the [[Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011]].<ref>http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/media-centre/news/mexxy</ref><ref>{{cite news | first = Wesley | last = Johnson | title = Bid to ban 'safe' drug Methoxetamine after deaths | date = 2012-03-06 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/bid-to-ban-safe-drug-methoxetamine-after-deaths-7542175.html | work = The Independent | accessdate = 2012-05-12 | location=London}}</ref> The ACMD gave their advice on 23 March, with the chair commenting that "the evidence shows that the use of methoxetamine can cause harm to users and the ACMD advises that it should be subject to a temporary class drug order."<ref name='ACMD MXE advice'>{{cite web | url = http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/agencies-public-bodies/acmd1/statement-methoxetamine | title = Statement of evidence - methoxetamine | accessdate = 2012-03-29 | date = 2012-02-23 | format = PDF | work = UK Home Office}}</ref> In April 2012, MXE was placed under [[temporary class drug]] control, which prohibits its import and sale for 12 months.<ref>{{cite web | title = Methoxetamine | url = http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/drugs/drug-law/temporary-class-drug-orders/methoxetamine/ | publisher = Home Office UK | accessdate = 2012-05-17 }}</ref>

:Theresa May commented in her reply to the ACMD that "the next step in this process is for the ACMD to undertake a full assessment of MXE for consideration for its permanent control under the 1971 Act." She goes on to say that she hopes the ACMD will do this as a part of the review of ketamine, "including its analogues" and that this review will be completed "within the 12 months from the making of the current order".<ref name=maysresponse>{{cite web | url = http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/alcohol-drugs/drugs/methoxetamine-hsresponse | title = Home Secretary's response to the ACMD's advice on methoxetamine | accessdate = 2012-03-28 | date = 2012-03-28 | work = UK Home Office}}</ref>

:On 18 October 2012 the ACMD released a [http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/agencies-public-bodies/acmd1/methoxetamine2012 report] about MXE, saying that the "harms of methoxetamine are commensurate with Class B of the Misuse of Drugs Act (1971)", despite the fact that the act does not classify drugs based on harm. The report went on to suggest that all analogues of MXE should also become class B drugs and suggested a catch-all clause covering both existing and unresearched arylcyclohexamines.

:MXE ceased to be covered by the temporary prohibition on 26 February 2013, when it became classified as a Class B drug.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/corporate-publications-strategy/home-office-circulars/circulars-2013/004-2013/| title = Home Office circular 004-2013 | accessdate = 2013-02-27 | date = 2013-02-20 | work = UK Home Office}}</ref>
