'''Gemtuzumab ozogamicin''' (marketed by [[Wyeth]] as '''Mylotarg''') is a drug-linked [[monoclonal antibody]] (an [[antibody-drug conjugate]]) that was used to treat [[acute myeloid leukemia]] from 2000 to 2010. It was withdrawn from market in June 2010 when a clinical trial showed the drug increased patient death and added no benefit over conventional cancer therapies. It was re-introduced into the US market in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Approved Drugs > FDA Approves Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin for CD33-positive AML|url=https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/ApprovedDrugs/ucm574518.htm|website=fda.gov|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|date=1 September 2017|accessdate=6 September 2017|location=Silver Spring, USA}}</ref>

==Mechanism and side effects==
Gemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody to [[CD33]] linked to a cytotoxic agent from the class of [[calicheamicin]]s.  CD33 is expressed in most leukemic blast cells but also in normal hematopoietic cells, the intensity diminishing with maturation of [[stem cells]].

Common side effects of administration included [[shiver]]ing, [[fever]], [[nausea]] and vomiting. Serious side effects included severe [[myelosuppression]] (suppressed activity of [[bone marrow]], which is involved in formation of various [[blood cell]]s [found in 98% of patients]), disorder of the [[respiratory system]], [[tumor lysis syndrome]], [[Immune complex hypersensitivity|Type III hypersensitivity]], venous occlusion, and death.

==History==
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin was created in a collaboration between [[Celltech]] and [[Wyeth]] that began in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mylotarg|url=http://drugprofiles.informa.com/drug_profiles/646-mylotarg|publisher=Informa Biomedtracker|accessdate=19 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Niculescu-Duvaz|first1=I|title=Technology evaluation: gemtuzumab ozogamicin, Celltech Group.|journal=Current opinion in molecular therapeutics|date=December 2000|volume=2|issue=6|pages=691–6|pmid=11249747}}</ref>  The same collaboration later produced [[inotuzumab ozogamicin]].<ref name=Damle2003>{{cite journal|last1=Damle|first1=NK|last2=Frost|first2=P|title=Antibody-targeted chemotherapy with immunoconjugates of calicheamicin.|journal=Current Opinion in Pharmacology|date=August 2003|volume=3|issue=4|pages=386–90|doi=10.1016/S1471-4892(03)00083-3|pmid=12901947}}</ref>  Celltech was acquired by [[UCB (company)|UCB]] in 2004<ref>{{cite news|title=Celltech sold to Belgian firm in £1.5bn deal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2004/may/18/businessofresearch.money|work=The Guardian|date=18 May 2004}}</ref>  and Wyeth was acquired by [[Pfizer]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sorkin|first1=Andrew Ross|last2=Wilson|first2=Duff|title=Pfizer Agrees to Pay $68 Billion for Rival Drug Maker Wyeth|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/26/business/26drug.html?mcubz=0|work=The New York Times|date=25 January 2009}}</ref>

In the United States, it was approved under an [[FDA Accelerated Approval Program|accelerated-approval process]] by the FDA in 2000 for use in patients over the age of 60 with relapsed [[acute myelogenous leukemia]] (AML); or those who are not considered candidates for standard chemotherapy.<ref name = FDA>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bross PF, Beitz J, Chewn G, Chen XH, Duffy E, Kieffer L, Roy S, Sridhara R, Rahman A, Williams G, Pazdur R | title=Approval summary: gemtuzumab ozogamicin in relapsed acute myeloid leukemia. | journal=Clin Cancer Res | year=2001 | pages=1490–6 | volume=7 | issue=6  | pmid=11410481}}</ref>
The accelerated approval was based on the [[surrogate endpoint]] of [[response rate (medicine)|response rate]].<ref name=VW2010/>  It was the first [[antibody-drug conjugate]] to be approved.<ref name=resub2017/>

Within the first year after approval,  the FDA required a black box warning be added to Gemtuzumab packaging.  The drug was noted to increase the risk of [[veno-occlusive disease]] in the absence of [[bone marrow transplantation]].<ref name = VOD>{{cite journal |vauthors=Giles FJ, Kantarjian HM, Kornblau SM, Thomas DA, Garcia-Manero G, Waddelow TA, David CL, Phan AT, Colburn DE, Rashid A, Estey EH | title=Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin) therapy is associated with hepatic venoocclusive disease in patients who have not received stem cell transplantation. | journal=Cancer | year=2001 | pages=406–13 | volume=92 | issue=2  | pmid=11466696 | doi=10.1002/1097-0142(20010715)92:2<406::AID-CNCR1336>3.0.CO;2-U}}</ref>  Later the onset of VOD was shown to occur at increased frequency in Gemtuzumab patients even following bone marrow transplantation.<ref name = BMTVOD>{{cite journal |vauthors=Wadleigh M, Richardson PG, Zahrieh D, Lee SJ, Cutler C, Ho V, Alyea EP, Antin JH, Stone RM, Soiffer RJ, DeAngelo DJ | title=Prior gemtuzumab ozogamicin exposure significantly increases the risk of veno-occlusive disease in patients who undergo myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation. | journal=Blood | year=2003 | pages=1578–82 | volume=102 | issue=5  | pmid=12738663 | doi=10.1182/blood-2003-01-0255}}</ref> The drug was discussed in a 2008 JAMA article, which criticized the inadequacy of postmarketing surveillance  of [[biologic agent]]s.<ref>[http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/293/17/2131.abstract The Research on Adverse Drug Events and Reports (RADAR) Project, ''JAMA'']</ref>

A randomized phase 3 comparative controlled trial (SWOG S0106) was initiated in 2004 by Wyeth in accordance with the [[FDA Accelerated Approval Program|FDA accelerated-approval process]].  The study was stopped{{when|date=February 2017}} prior to completion due to worrisome outcomes.  Among the patients evaluated for early toxicity, fatal toxicity rate was significantly higher in the gemtuzumab combination therapy group vs the standard therapy group. Mortality was 5.7% with gemtuzumab and 1.4% without the agent (16/283 = 5.7% vs 4/281 = 1.4%; P = .01).<ref name=VW2010>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/723957 Gemtuzumab Voluntarily Withdrawn From US Market.

In June 2010, Pfizer withdrew Mylotarg from the market at the request of the US FDA.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm216458.htm Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin): Market Withdrawal], US FDA</ref><ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE65K5QG20100621 Pfizer pulls leukemia drug from U.S. market], ''Reuters''</ref>  However, some other regulatory authorities did not agree with the FDA decision, with Japan's Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency stating in 2011 that the "risk-benefit balance of gemtuzumab ozogamicin has not changed from its state at the time of approval".<ref>{{cite techreport | institution=Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency of Japan |url=http://www.pmda.go.jp/english/service/pdf/precautions/PMDSI-277.pdf | title=Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Safety Information, No. 277, February 2011 | year=2011}}</ref>

In early 2017 Pfizer reapplied for US and EU approval, based on a meta-analysis of prior trials and results of the ALFA-0701 clinical trial, an open-label Phase III trial in 280 older people with AML.<ref name=resub2017>{{cite news|last1=Stanton|first1=Dan|title=Pfizer resubmits US and EU application for withdrawn ADC Mylotarg|url=http://www.biopharma-reporter.com/Markets-Regulations/Pfizer-resubmits-US-and-EU-application-for-withdrawn-ADC-Mylotarg|work=BioPharma Reporter|date=February 1, 2017}}</ref>
