'''Biobased product''', was defined by the United States [[Secretary of Agriculture]] in the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 as follows, "The term ‘‘biobased product’’ means a product determined by the Secretary to be a commercial or industrial product (other than food or feed) that is composed, in whole or in significant part, of [[biological]] products or [[renewable]] domestic [[agricultural]] materials (including plant, animal, and marine materials) or [[forestry]] materials OR an [[intermediate feedstock]].

== Sources of biobased products ==
Some examples of agricultural resources that make up many biobased products include: [[soybeans]], [[maize|corn]], [[kenaf]], [[flax]], [[jute]], and numerous other types of crops that are harvested.  Current applications of these agricultural resources create products such as [[ethanol]] (corn-based), [[soybean wax|soy candles]], [[soy|soy-based]] lubricants, [[kenaf]] office paper, and [[bioplastic]]s to name a few.

== Benefits of biobased products ==
The purchasing of biobased products helps many of the farmers across America who grow corn, soybeans, and other resources used by companies in the biobased industry.  For example, ethanol is currently one of the leading alternative fuel sources in the U.S.  In 2005 year, the [http://www.ethanolrfa.org/ Renewable Fuels Association] reported {{convert|3,904|e6USgal|m3}} produced by 81 plants.  Currently for the 2006 year, there are 97 ethanol plants with 33 more in production.  A majority of these plants are owned by a collective of farms across the midwest. Another key benefit of biobased products is that they are not petroleum-based.  This helps alleviate the consumption of resources that harm the environment in terms of biodegrability, toxicity, and pollution.

== Organizations for biobased products ==
The following organizations are leading the way in supporting the Biobased Industry.

===BioPreferred Program===
The [http://www.biopreferred.gov] program was created after the passing of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (FSRIA), when it was then known as the Federal Biobased Products Preferred Procurement Program or FB4P.  The [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] is overseeing the program.  The research undertaken by the program helps implement the Farm Bill’s requirement of getting federal agencies to specifically buy biobased products.  One key factor is the requirement that such products are readily available, reasonably priced, and pass the required performance standards of their non-biobased counterparts.

===United Soybean Board===
The [http://www.unitedsoybean.org United Soybean Board] helps promote the use of soybeans farmed across America for use in consumer and industrial products.  Originally created from the 1990 Farm Bill and funded by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]], the  United Soybean Board performs research, advertising, and other functions to strengthen the soybean industry.  To see the variety of products made from soybeans, a directory of products and companies is offered on their website.
