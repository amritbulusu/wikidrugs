'''Embutramide''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]]) (brand name '''Embutane''') is a potent [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] and [[sedative]] [[drug]] that is structurally related to [[methadone]].<ref name="Elks2014">{{cite book|author=J.

Along with strong [[sedation|sedative]] effects, embutramide also produces [[respiratory depression]] and [[Cardiac arrhythmia|ventricular arrhythmia]]. Because of these properties, it was never adopted for medical use as an anesthetic as it was considered too dangerous for this purpose. Instead it is used for [[Animal euthanasia|euthanasia]] in [[veterinary medicine]], mainly for the euthanization of dogs.

Embutramide is formulated as a [[combination drug|combination product]] under the brand name '''Tributame''', which also contains [[chloroquine]] and [[lidocaine]].<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/downloads/animalveterinary/products/approvedanimaldrugproducts/foiadrugsummaries/ucm051493.pdf]</ref>

Embutramide is used for euthanasia of a range of different animals, mainly small animals kept as pets rather than large farm animals. It may cause significant pain to the animal being euthanized,<ref>Hellebrekers LJ, Baumans V, Bertens AP, Hartman W. The use of T61 for the humane killing of pets and laboratory animals. ''Tijdschrift voor Diergeneeskdunde''. (Dutch) 1990 Jul 1;115(13):625-32.</ref> and so may be less humane than older drugs used for this purpose such as [[pentobarbital]], however it may have less abuse potential than barbiturates especially in the Tributame combination formulation, and so is less likely to be diverted for recreational abuse.<ref>[http://www.avma.org/onlnews/javma/nov06/061101b.asp DEA lists embutramide as schedule III controlled substance]</ref> Embutramide has however been reported to be used for [[suicide]] by people with access to the drug,<ref>Smith RA, Lewis D. Suicide by ingestion of T-61. ''Veterinary and Human Toxicology''. 1989 Aug;31(4):319-20.</ref><ref>Kintz P, Cirimele V, Ludes B. Blood investigation in a fatality involving the veterinary drug T-61. ''Journal of Analytical Toxicology''. 2002 Oct;26(7):529-31.</ref> and was added to the [[list of Schedule III drugs]] in the USA in 2006, as a Non-Narcotic with ACSCN 2020, which classifies it with depressants such as benzodiazepines, barbitutates, and other sedative-hypnotics.<ref>DEA lists embutramide as schedule III controlled substance. ''Journal of the  American Veterinary Medical Association''. 2006 Nov 1;229(9):1358.</ref>
