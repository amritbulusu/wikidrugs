'''Cefaclor''', developed by Eli Lilly under the trade name Ceclor, is a second-generation [[cephalosporin]] [[antibiotic]] used to treat some [[infection]]s caused by [[bacteria]] such as [[pneumonia]] and infections of the ear, lung, skin, throat, and urinary tract. It is also available from other manufacturers as a generic.<ref>https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm</ref>

== Indications==

Cefaclor belongs to the family of antibiotics known as the [[cephalosporins]] (cefalosporins). The cephalosporins are broad-spectrum [[antibiotics]] that are used for the treatment of [[septicaemia]], [[pneumonia]], [[meningitis]], biliary tract infections, [[peritonitis]], and urinary tract infections. The pharmacology of the cephalosporins is similar to that of the [[penicillins]], excretion being principally renal. Cephalosporins penetrate the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] poorly unless the meninges are inflamed; [[cefotaxime]] is a more suitable cephalosporin than cefaclor for infections of the [[central nervous system]], e.g. [[meningitis]]. Cefaclor is active against many [[bacteria]], including both [[Gram-negative]] and [[Gram-positive]] organisms.

==Cautions and contraindications==
Cautions include known sensitivity to beta-lactam antibacterials, such as penicillins (Cefaclor should be avoided if there is a history of immediate [[hypersensitivity]] reaction); renal impairment (no dose adjustment required, although manufacturer advises caution); [[pregnancy]] and [[breast-feeding]] (but appropriate to use); false positive urinary glucose (if tested for reducing substances) and false positive [[Coombs test]].  Cefaclor has also been reported to cause a [[serum sickness]]-like reaction in children.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hebert A, Sigman E, Levy M |title=Serum sickness-like reactions from cefaclor in children |journal=J Am Acad Dermatol |volume=25 |issue=5 Pt 1 |pages=805–8 |year=1991 |pmid=1802903 |doi=10.1016/S0190-9622(08)80973-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Parra F, Igea J, Martín J, Alonso M, Lezaun A, Sainz T |title=Serum sickness-like syndrome associated with cefaclor therapy |journal=Allergy |volume=47 |issue=4 Pt 2 |pages=439–40 |year=1992 |pmid=1456417 |doi=10.1111/j.1398-9995.1992.tb02086.x}}</ref>

Cefaclor is contraindicated in case of hypersensitivity (i.e. allergy) to cephalosporins.

==Spectrum of bacterial susceptibility and resistance==
Cefaclor is frequently used against bacteria responsible for causing skin infections, otitis media, urinary tract infections, and others. 
Cefaclor has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections: Gram positive aerobes - Staphylococci (including coagulase-positive, coagulase-negative, and penicillinase-producing strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A ß-hemolytic streptococci).

The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant microorganisms.
* ''Haemophilus influenzae'':  0.03 μg/mL - 128 μg/mL
* ''Staphylcoccus aureus'':  0.6 μg/mL - 128 μg/mL
* ''Streptococcus pyogenes'':  0.06 μg/mL - 4 μg/mL

==Side effects==
The principal [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]] of the cephalosporins is hypersensitivity.  Penicillin-sensitive patients will also be allergic to the cephalosporins, depending on the cephalosporin generation.  The previous percentage of 10% cross reactivity rates are often overestimated.  Allergic reactions may present as, for example, rashes, [[pruritus]] (itching), [[urticaria]], [[serum sickness-like reaction]]s with rashes, fever and [[arthralgia]], and [[anaphylaxis]]. The frequency and severity of [[serum sickness]]-like reactions in children has led researchers to question its role in pediatric illness.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=King BA, Geelhoed GC |title=Adverse skin and joint reactions associated with oral antibiotics in children: the role of cefaclor in serum sickness-like reactions |journal=J Paediatr Child Health |volume=39 |issue=9 |pages=677–81 |date=December 2003 |pmid=14629499 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=1034-4810&date=2003&volume=39&issue=9&spage=677 |doi=10.1046/j.1440-1754.2003.00267.x}}</ref> [[File:Allergy to Antibiotic Cefaclor.JPG|thumb|Skin Allergy to Cefaclor|300px|left]] Other side effects include gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g. diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, abdominal discomfort, disturbances in liver enzymes, transient [[hepatitis]] and cholestatic jaundice), [[headache]], and [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]]. Rare side effects include [[eosinophilia]] and blood disorders (including [[thrombocytopenia]], [[leucopenia]], [[agranulocytosis]], [[aplastic anaemia]] and [[haemolytic anaemia]]); reversible [[interstitial nephritis]]; [[hyperactivity]], [[Anxiety|nervousness]], sleep disturbances, [[hallucinations]], [[confusion]], [[hypertonia]], and [[dizziness]]. [[Toxic epidermal necrolysis]] has been reported. In the UK, The Committee on the Safety of Medicines ([[Committee on Safety of Medicines|CSM]]) has warned that the risk of diarrhea and rarely antibiotic-associated colitis are more likely with higher doses.

==Interactions with other medications==

===Coumarins===
[[Cephalosporins]] possibly enhance the [[anticoagulant]] effect of [[coumarins]] (e.g. [[Warfarin]]) - change in patient's clinical condition, particularly associated with liver disease, intercurrent illness, or drug administration, necessitates more frequent testing of [[International normalized ratio|INR]], and dose adjustment as necessary.

===Probenecid===
Excretion of [[cephalosporins]] is reduced by [[probenecid]] (resulting in increased concentrations of drug in the [[blood plasma]]).

===Antacids===
Absorption of cefaclor is reduced by [[antacids]]. Therefore antacids should not be taken right before or at the same time as cefaclor.<ref>https://www.drugs.com/mtm/ceclor.html</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 1287615 | volume=68 Suppl 3 | title=Pharmacokinetics of cefaclor AF: effects of age, antacids and H2-receptor antagonists | journal=Postgrad Med J | pages=S3-9 | last1 = Satterwhite | first1 = JH | last2 = Cerimele | first2 = BJ | last3 = Coleman | first3 = DL | last4 = Hatcher | first4 = BL | last5 = Kisicki | first5 = J | last6 = DeSante | first6 = KA}}</ref>

==Safety in pregnancy and breastfeeding==
Cefaclor is passed into the [[breast milk]] in small quantities, but is generally accepted to be safe to take during [[breastfeeding]].<ref>{{cite web|last=LactMED|title=Summary of Cefaclor's use during lactation|url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/f?./temp/~gthK7d:1|publisher=National Library of Medicine|accessdate=22 May 2011}}</ref> Cefaclor is not known to be harmful in [[pregnancy]].<ref name="Breast feeding and Cefaclor">{{cite journal|last=Ito|first=S. |author2=Blajchman A |author3=Stephenson M|title=Prospective follow-up of adverse reactions in breast-fed infants exposed to maternal medication|journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol|year=1993|issue=5|pages=1393–1399|pmid=8498418|volume=168|doi=10.1016/s0002-9378(11)90771-6|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

==Cefaclor CD==
Cefaclor CD is a [[sustained release]] form of Cefaclor which releases the drug, to the body over a longer period of time, which means that doses can be taken less frequently, with steadier levels of the drug in, the bloodstream. Sustained release is useful with Cefaclor as it has a very short half-life. Blood transfusions are the #1 passer of this drug
