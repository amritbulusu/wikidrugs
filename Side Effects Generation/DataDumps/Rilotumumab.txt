'''Rilotumumab''' (previously '''AMG102''') is a human monoclonal antibody designed for the treatment of solid tumors.<ref>{{cite web|title=Statement On A Nonproprietary Name Adopted By The USAN Council: Rilotumumab|publisher=[[American Medical Association]]|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/365/rilotumumab.pdf}}</ref>

Rilotumumab was in development by [[Amgen]], Inc. until in November 2014, when Amgen announced it had halted all clinical trials of the compound in advanced [[gastric cancer]] (including two Phase III studies) after one of the trials found an increase in the number of deaths in those who were taking rilotumumab and chemotherapy when compared to those who were only administered chemotherapy.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgen-scraps-trials-drug-advanced-143216111.html| title=Amgen scraps trials of drug for advanced stomach cancer| website= yahoo.com| date=24 Nov 2014| accessdate= 24 Nov 2014}}</ref><ref>http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/amgen-halts-rilotumumab-trials-in-advanced-gastric-cancer/81250637/</ref>
