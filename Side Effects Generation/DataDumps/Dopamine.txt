'''Dopamine''' ('''DA''', a contraction of '''3,4-<u>d</u>ihydr<u>o</u>xy<u>p</u>henethyl<u>amine</u>''') is an [[organic compound|organic chemical]] of the [[catecholamine]] and [[phenethylamine]] families that plays several important roles in the brain and body. It is an [[amine]] synthesized by removing a [[C-terminus|carboxyl group]] from a molecule of its [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor chemical]] [[L-DOPA]], which is [[biosynthesis|synthesized]] in the brain and kidneys. Dopamine is also synthesized in plants and most animals.

In the [[brain]], dopamine functions as a [[neurotransmitter]]—a chemical released by [[neuron]]s (nerve cells) to send signals to other nerve cells. The brain includes several distinct [[dopaminergic pathway|dopamine pathways]], one of which plays a major role in [[reward system|reward-motivated behavior]]. Most types of rewards increase the level of dopamine in the brain, and many [[addiction|addictive]] drugs increase dopamine neuronal activity.  Other brain dopamine pathways are involved in [[motor system|motor control]] and in controlling the release of various hormones. These pathways and [[dopaminergic cell groups|cell groups]] form a dopamine system which is [[neuromodulation|neuromodulatory]].

Outside the [[central nervous system]], dopamine functions primarily as a local [[neurotransmitter|chemical messenger]].  In blood vessels, it inhibits [[norepinephrine]] release and acts as a [[vasodilator]] (at normal concentrations); in the kidneys, it increases sodium excretion and urine output; in the [[pancreas]], it reduces insulin production; in the digestive system, it reduces [[Gastrointestinal physiology#Motility|gastrointestinal motility]] and protects [[intestinal mucosa]]; and in the immune system, it reduces the activity of [[lymphocytes]].  With the exception of the blood vessels, dopamine in each of these peripheral systems is synthesized locally and exerts its effects near the cells that release it.

Several important diseases of the nervous system are associated with dysfunctions of the dopamine system, and some of the key medications used to treat them work by altering the effects of dopamine. [[Parkinson's disease]], a degenerative condition causing tremor and motor impairment, is caused by a loss of dopamine-secreting neurons in an area of the [[midbrain]] called the [[substantia nigra]]. Its metabolic precursor L-DOPA can be manufactured, and in its pure form marketed as ''Levodopa'' is the most widely used treatment for the condition. There is evidence that [[schizophrenia]] involves altered levels of dopamine activity, and most [[antipsychotic|antipsychotic drugs]] used to treat this are [[dopamine antagonist]]s which reduce dopamine activity.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Moncrieff J | title =The myth of the chemical cure.

==Structure==
A dopamine molecule consists of a [[catechol]] structure (a [[benzene]] ring with two [[hydroxyl]] side groups) with one [[amine]] group attached via an [[ethyl group|ethyl]] chain.<ref name=PubChem>{{cite web |url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/dopamine |title=Dopamine |publisher=PubChem |accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref>  As such, dopamine is the simplest possible [[catecholamine]], a family that also includes the [[neurotransmitter]]s [[norepinephrine]] and [[epinephrine]].<ref name=Catecholamine>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/science/catecholamine |title=Catecholamine |publisher=Brittanica |accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref> The presence of a benzene ring with this amine attachment makes it a [[substituted phenethylamine]], a family that includes numerous [[psychoactive drug]]s.<ref name=Phenethylamine>{{cite web |url=http://www.chemicalland21.com/lifescience/phar/PHENYLETHYLAMINE.htm|title=Phenylethylamine |publisher=ChemicalLand21.com |accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref>

Like most [[amine]]s, dopamine is an [[organic base]].<ref name=Carter>{{cite journal |vauthors=Carter JE, Johnson JH, Baaske DM |year=1982 |title=Dopamine Hydrochloride |journal=Analytical Profiles of Drug Substances |volume=11 |pages=257–272}}</ref> As a [[base (chemistry)|base]], it is generally [[protonation|protonated]] in [[acid]]ic environments (in an [[acid-base reaction]]).<ref name=Carter/> The protonated form is highly water-soluble and relatively stable, but can become [[oxidation|oxidized]] if exposed to [[oxygen]] or other [[oxidising agent|oxidants]].<ref name=Carter/> In basic environments, dopamine is not protonated.<ref name=Carter/> In this [[free base]] form, it is less water-soluble and also more highly reactive.<ref name=Carter/> Because of the increased stability and water-solubility of the protonated form, dopamine is supplied for chemical or pharmaceutical use as dopamine hydrochloride—that is, the [[hydrochloride]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] that is created when dopamine is combined with [[hydrochloric acid]].<ref name=Carter/> In dry form, dopamine hydrochloride is a fine colorless powder.<ref name=Carter/>

The direct precursor of dopamine, [[L-DOPA|<small>L</small>-DOPA]], can be synthesized indirectly from the [[essential amino acid]] [[phenylalanine]] or directly from the non-essential amino acid [[tyrosine]].<ref name=Musacchio/> These [[amino acid]]s are found in nearly every [[protein]] and so are readily available in [[food]], with tyrosine being the most common. Although dopamine is also found in many types of food, it is incapable of crossing the [[blood–brain barrier]] that surrounds and protects the brain.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> It must therefore be synthesized inside the brain to perform its [[neurotransmission|neuronal activity]].<ref name="Nice-pharma"/>

<small>L</small>-Phenylalanine is converted into <small>L</small>-tyrosine by the [[enzyme]] [[phenylalanine hydroxylase]], with [[allotropes of oxygen#Dioxygen|molecular oxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>) and [[tetrahydrobiopterin]] as [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]].  <small>L</small>-Tyrosine is converted into <small>L</small>-DOPA by the enzyme [[tyrosine hydroxylase]], with tetrahydrobiopterin, O<sub>2</sub>, and [[ferrous|iron]] (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) as cofactors.<ref name=Musacchio>{{cite book |title=Biochemistry of Biogenic Amines |chapter=Chapter 1: Enzymes involved in the biosynthesis and degradation of catecholamines | vauthors= Musacchio JM | veditors = Iverson L |publisher=Springer |isbn=1-4684-3171-4 |year=2013 |pages=1–35}}</ref> <small>L</small>-DOPA is converted into dopamine by the enzyme [[aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase|aromatic <small>L</small>-amino acid decarboxylase]] (also known as DOPA decarboxylase), with [[pyridoxal phosphate]] as the cofactor.<ref name=Musacchio/>

Dopamine itself is used as precursor in the synthesis of the neurotransmitters [[norepinephrine]] and [[epinephrine]].<ref name=Musacchio/> Dopamine is converted into norepinephrine by the enzyme [[dopamine beta hydroxylase|dopamine β-hydroxylase]], with O<sub>2</sub> and [[ascorbic acid|<small>L</small>-ascorbic acid]] as cofactors.<ref name=Musacchio/> Norepinephrine is converted into epinephrine by the enzyme [[phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase|phenylethanolamine ''N''-methyltransferase]] with [[S-Adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl-<small>L</small>-methionine]] as the cofactor.<ref name=Musacchio/>

Some of the cofactors also require their own synthesis.<ref name=Musacchio/> Deficiency in any required amino acid or cofactor can impair the synthesis of dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.<ref name=Musacchio/>

===Degradation===
Dopamine is broken down into inactive [[metabolite]]s by a set of enzymes—[[monoamine oxidase]] (MAO),  [[catechol-O-methyl transferase|catechol-''O''-methyl transferase]] (COMT), and [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]] (ALDH), acting in sequence.<ref name=Eisenhofer>{{cite journal | vauthors = Eisenhofer G, Kopin IJ, Goldstein DS | title = Catecholamine metabolism: a contemporary view with implications for physiology and medicine | journal = Pharmacological Reviews | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 331–49 | year=2004 | pmid = 15317907 | doi = 10.1124/pr.56.3.1 }}</ref>  Both [[protein isoform|isoforms]] of monoamine oxidase, [[Monoamine oxidase A|MAO-A]] and [[Monoamine oxidase B|MAO-B]], effectively metabolize dopamine.<ref name=Musacchio/> Different breakdown pathways exist but the main end-product is [[homovanillic acid]] (HVA), which has no known biological activity.<ref name=Eisenhofer/>  From the bloodstream, homovanillic acid is filtered out by the kidneys and then excreted in the urine.<ref name=Eisenhofer/> The two primary metabolic routes that convert dopamine into HVA are:
*Dopamine → [[DOPAL]] → [[DOPAC]] → HVA&nbsp;– catalyzed by MAO, ALDH, and COMT respectively
*Dopamine → [[3-Methoxytyramine]] → HVA&nbsp;– catalyzed by COMT and MAO+ALDH respectively

In clinical research on schizophrenia, measurements of homovanillic acid in [[blood plasma|plasma]] have been used to estimate levels of dopamine activity in the brain. A difficulty in this approach however, is separating the high level of plasma homovanillic acid contributed by the metabolism of norepinephrine.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Amin F, Davidson M, Davis KL | title = Homovanillic acid measurement in clinical research: a review of methodology | journal = Schizophrenia Bulletin | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 123–48 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1553492 | url = http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/1/123.short |accessdate=24 September 2015 | doi=10.1093/schbul/18.1.123}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Amin F, Davidson M, Kahn RS, Schmeidler J, Stern R, Knott PJ, Apter S | title = Assessment of the central dopaminergic index of plasma HVA in schizophrenia | journal = Schizophrenia Bulletin | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 53–66 | date = 1995 | pmid = 7770741 | doi = 10.1093/schbul/21.1.53 }}<!--|accessdate=13 November 2015--></ref>

Dopamine exerts its effects by binding to and activating [[cell surface receptor]]s.<ref name=Seeman/> In humans, dopamine has a high [[binding affinity]] at [[dopamine receptor]]s and [[trace amine-associated receptor 1]] (TAAR1).<ref name="DA IUPHAR" /><ref name="Miller+Grandy 2016" /> In mammals, five subtypes of [[dopamine receptor]]s have been identified, labeled from D1 to D5.<ref name=Seeman>{{cite book| title=The Dopamine Receptors |chapter=Chapter 1: Historical overview: Introduction to the dopamine receptors | vauthors = Seeman P | veditors = Neve K| publisher=Springer |year=2009 |isbn=1-60327-333-6 |pages=1–22}}</ref>  All of them function as [[metabotropic receptor|metabotropic]], [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s, meaning that they exert their effects via a complex [[second messenger system]].<ref name=Romanelli>{{cite book| title=The Dopamine Receptors |chapter=Chapter 6: Dopamine receptor signalling: intracellular pathways to behavior | vauthors = Romanelli RJ, Williams JT, Neve KA | veditors = Neve KA| publisher = Springer | year = 2009 | isbn = 1-60327-333-6 | pages = 137–174}}</ref> These receptors can be divided into two families, known as [[D1-like receptor|D1-like]] and [[D2-like receptor|D2-like]].<ref name=Seeman/> For receptors located on neurons in the nervous system, the ultimate effect of D1-like activation (D1 and D5) can be excitation (via opening of [[sodium channel]]s) or inhibition (via opening of [[potassium channel]]s); the ultimate effect of D2-like activation (D2, D3, and D4) is usually inhibition of the target neuron.<ref name=Romanelli/> Consequently, it is incorrect to describe dopamine itself as either excitatory or inhibitory: its effect on a target neuron depends on which types of receptors are present on the membrane of that neuron and on the internal responses of that neuron to the second messenger [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]].<ref name=Romanelli/> D1 receptors are the most numerous dopamine receptors in the human nervous system; D2 receptors are next; D3, D4, and D5 receptors are present at significantly lower levels.<ref name=Romanelli/>

Inside the brain, dopamine functions as a [[neurotransmitter]] and [[neuromodulator]], and is controlled by a set of mechanisms common to all [[monoamine neurotransmitter]]s.<ref name=Seeman/> After synthesis, dopamine is transported from the [[cytosol]] into [[vesicle (biology and chemistry)|synaptic vesicles]] by a [[solute carrier family|solute carrier]]—a [[vesicular monoamine transporter]], [[vesicular monoamine transporter 2|VMAT2]].<ref name=Eiden>{{cite journal | vauthors = Eiden LE, Schäfer MK, Weihe E, Schütz B | title = The vesicular amine transporter family (SLC18): amine/proton antiporters required for vesicular accumulation and regulated exocytotic secretion of monoamines and acetylcholine | journal = Pflugers Arch. | volume = 447 | issue = 5 | pages = 636–40  | year=2004 | pmid = 12827358 | doi = 10.1007/s00424-003-1100-5 }}</ref> Dopamine is stored in these vesicles until it is ejected into the [[chemical synapse|synaptic cleft]]. In most cases, the release of dopamine occurs through a process called [[exocytosis]] which is caused by [[action potential]]s, but it can also be caused by the activity of an intracellular [[trace amine-associated receptor]], [[TAAR1]].<ref name="Miller+Grandy 2016" /> TAAR1 is a high-affinity receptor for dopamine, [[trace amine]]s, and certain [[substituted amphetamine]]s that is located along membranes in the intracellular milieu of the presynaptic cell;<ref name="Miller+Grandy 2016" /> activation of the receptor can regulate dopamine signaling by inducing dopamine [[reuptake inhibition]] and [[transporter reversal|efflux]] as well as by inhibiting neuronal firing through a diverse set of mechanisms.<ref name="Miller+Grandy 2016" /><ref name="Miller" />

Once in the synapse, dopamine binds to and activates dopamine receptors.<ref name="D2 Long and short" /> These can be [[chemical synapse|postsynaptic]] dopamine receptors, which are located on [[dendrite]]s (the postsynaptic neuron), or presynaptic [[autoreceptor]]s (e.g., the [[dopamine receptor D2#Isoforms|D<sub>2</sub>sh]] and presynaptic D<sub>3</sub> receptors), which are located on the membrane of an [[axon terminal]] (the presynaptic neuron).<ref name=Seeman/><ref name="D2 Long and short">{{cite journal | vauthors = Beaulieu JM, Gainetdinov RR | title = The physiology, signaling, and pharmacology of dopamine receptors | journal = Pharmacological Reviews | volume = 63 | issue = 1 | pages = 182–217 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 21303898 | doi = 10.1124/pr.110.002642 }}</ref>  After the postsynaptic neuron elicits an action potential, dopamine molecules quickly become unbound from their receptors.

The [[substantia nigra]] is a small [[midbrain]] area that forms a component of the [[basal ganglia]].

The largest and most important sources of dopamine in the vertebrate brain are the [[substantia nigra]] and [[ventral tegmental area]].<ref name=Bjorklund/>  These structures are closely related to each other and functionally similar in many respects.<ref name=Bjorklund/>  Both are components of the [[basal ganglia]], a complex network of structures located mainly at the base of the [[forebrain]].<ref name=Bjorklund/>  The largest component of the basal ganglia is the [[striatum]].<ref name=brs>{{cite book |vauthors=Fix JD| title = Neuroanatomy (Board Review Series) |edition=4th |location=Baltimore |publisher=Wulters Kluwer & Lippincott Wiliams & Wilkins |chapter=Basal Ganglia and the Striatal Motor System |year=2008 |pages=274–281 |isbn=0-7817-7245-1}}</ref>  The substantia nigra sends a dopaminergic projection to the [[dorsal striatum]], while the ventral tegmental area sends a similar type of dopaminergic projection to the [[ventral striatum]].<ref name=Bjorklund/>

Progress in understanding the functions of the basal ganglia has been slow.<ref name="brs"/>  The most popular hypotheses, broadly stated, propose that the basal ganglia play a central role in [[action selection]].<ref name=chakravarthy>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chakravarthy VS, Joseph D, Bapi RS | title = What do the basal ganglia do?

In other words, they essentially form a decision-making system.<ref name=Floresco/>

The basal ganglia can be divided into several sectors, and each is involved in controlling particular types of actions.<ref name=Balleine>{{cite journal |vauthors=Balleine BW, Dezfouli A, Ito M, Doya K |year=2015 |title=Hierarchical control of goal-directed action in the cortical–basal ganglia network |journal=Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences |volume=5 |pages=1–7 |doi=10.1016/j.cobeha.2015.06.001}}</ref>  The ventral sector of the basal ganglia (containing the ventral striatum and ventral tegmental area) operates at the highest level of the hierarchy, selecting actions at the whole-organism level.<ref name=Floresco/>  The dorsal sectors (containing the dorsal striatum and substantia nigra) operate at lower levels, selecting the specific muscles and movements that are used to implement a given behavior pattern.<ref name=Balleine/>

Dopamine contributes to the action selection process in at least two important ways. First, it sets the "threshold" for initiating actions.<ref name=chakravarthy/> The higher the level of dopamine activity, the lower the impetus required to evoke a given behavior.<ref name=chakravarthy/> As a consequence, high levels of dopamine lead to high levels of motor activity and [[impulsivity|impulsive behavior]]; low levels of dopamine lead to [[torpor]] and slowed reactions.<ref name=chakravarthy/> [[Parkinson's disease]], in which dopamine levels in the substantia nigra circuit are greatly reduced, is characterized by stiffness and difficulty initiating movement—however, when people with the disease are confronted with strong stimuli such as a serious threat, their reactions can be as vigorous as those of a healthy person.<ref name=Jankovic/> In the opposite direction, drugs that increase dopamine release, such as cocaine or amphetamine, can produce heightened levels of activity, including at the extreme, [[psychomotor agitation]] and [[stereotypy|stereotyped movements]].<ref name=Patti>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pattij T, Vanderschuren LJ | title = The neuropharmacology of impulsive behaviour | journal = Trends in Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 192–9 | year=2008 | pmid = 18304658 | doi = 10.1016/j.tips.2008.01.002 | url = http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Louk_Vanderschuren/publication/5547125_The_neuropharmacology_of_impulsive_behaviour/links/5487fe140cf268d28f072f9e.pdf |accessdate=24 September 2015}}</ref>

The second important effect of dopamine is as a "teaching" signal.<ref name=chakravarthy/> When an action is followed by an increase in dopamine activity, the basal ganglia circuit is altered in a way that makes the same response easier to evoke when similar situations arise in the future.<ref name=chakravarthy/> This is a form of [[operant conditioning]], in which dopamine plays the role of a reward signal.<ref name=Floresco/>

====Reward====
[[File:Overview of reward structures in the human brain.jpg|thumb|Illustration of dopaminergic reward structures]]
In the [[reward system]], ''reward'' is the attractive and [[motivation]]al property of a stimulus that induces [[appetite|appetitive]] behavior  (also known as approach behavior) – and consummatory behavior.<ref name=Schultz /> A rewarding stimulus is one that has the potential to cause an approach to it and a choice to be made to consume it or not.<ref name=Schultz /> [[Pleasure]], [[learning]] (e.g., [[classical conditioning|classical]] and [[operant conditioning]]), and approach behavior are the three main functions of reward.<ref name=Schultz /> As an aspect of reward, ''pleasure'' provides a definition of reward;<ref name=Schultz /> however, while all pleasurable stimuli are rewarding, not all rewarding stimuli are pleasurable (e.g., extrinstic rewards like money).<ref name=Schultz /><ref name=Robinson>{{cite journal | vauthors = Robinson TE, Berridge KC | title = The neural basis of drug craving: an incentive-sensitization theory of addiction | journal = Brain Research.

We have proposed that in susceptible individuals the neural sensitization of incentive salience by drugs of abuse may generate compulsive ‘wanting’ to take more drugs, whether or not the same drugs are correspondingly ‘liked’, and thus contribute to addiction [39•,40•,42] (Figure 5).<br />[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2756052/figure/F5/ Incentive-sensitization model of addiction]}}</ref> In human [[addiction|drug addicts]], "wanting" becomes dissociated with "liking" as the desire to use an addictive drug increases, while the pleasure obtained from consuming it decreases due to [[drug tolerance]].<ref name="NAcc function" />

Within the brain, dopamine functions partly as a "global reward signal", where an initial phasic dopamine response to a rewarding stimulus encodes information about the [[salience (neuroscience)|salience]], value, and context of a reward.<ref name=Schultz /> In the context of reward-related learning, dopamine also functions as a ''reward prediction error'' signal, that is, the degree to which the value of a reward is unexpected.<ref name=Schultz/> According to this hypothesis of [[Wolfram Schultz]], rewards that are expected do not produce a second phasic dopamine response in certain dopaminergic cells, but rewards that are unexpected, or greater than expected, produce a short-lasting increase in synaptic dopamine, whereas the omission of an expected reward actually causes dopamine release to drop below its background level.<ref name=Schultz/> The "prediction error" hypothesis has drawn particular interest from computational neuroscientists, because an influential computational-learning method known as [[temporal difference learning]] makes heavy use of a signal that encodes prediction error.<ref name=Schultz/> This confluence of theory and data has led to a fertile interaction between neuroscientists and computer scientists interested in [[machine learning]].<ref name=Schultz/>

Evidence from [[microelectrode]] recordings from the brains of animals shows that dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra are strongly activated by a wide variety of rewarding events.<ref name=Schultz>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schultz W | year = 2015 | title = Neuronal reward and decision signals: from theories to data | journal = Physiological Reviews | volume = 95 | issue = 3 | pages = 853–951 | pmid = 26109341 | pmc = 4491543 | doi=10.1152/physrev.00023.2014 | quote = Rewards are crucial objects that induce learning, approach behavior, choices, and emotions. Whereas emotions are difficult to investigate in animals, the learning function is mediated by neuronal reward prediction error signals which implement basic constructs of reinforcement learning theory.

This organization of the DA system, wide projection from a limited number of cell bodies, permits coordinated responses to potent new rewards. Thus, acting in diverse terminal fields, dopamine confers motivational salience (“wanting”) on the reward itself or associated cues (nucleus accumbens shell region), updates the value placed on different goals in light of this new experience (orbital prefrontal cortex), helps consolidate multiple forms of memory (amygdala and hippocampus), and encodes new motor programs that will facilitate obtaining this reward in the future (nucleus accumbens core region and dorsal striatum). In this example, dopamine modulates the processing of sensorimotor information in diverse neural circuits to maximize the ability of the organism to obtain future rewards.&nbsp;...<br />The brain reward circuitry that is targeted by addictive drugs normally mediates the pleasure and strengthening of behaviors associated with natural reinforcers, such as food, water, and sexual contact. Dopamine neurons in the VTA are activated by food and water, and dopamine release in the NAc is stimulated by the presence of natural reinforcers, such as food, water, or a sexual partner.&nbsp;...<br />The NAc and VTA are central components of the circuitry underlying reward and memory of reward. As previously mentioned, the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appears to be linked to reward prediction. The NAc is involved in learning associated with reinforcement and the modulation of motoric responses to stimuli that satisfy internal homeostatic needs. The shell of the NAc appears to be particularly important to initial drug actions within reward circuitry; addictive drugs appear to have a greater effect on dopamine release in the shell than in the core of the NAc.&nbsp;... If motivational drive is described in terms of wanting, and hedonic evaluation in terms of liking, it appears that wanting can be dissociated from liking and that dopamine may influence these phenomena differently. Differences between wanting and liking are confirmed in reports by human addicts, who state that their desire for drugs (wanting) increases with continued use even when pleasure (liking) decreases because of tolerance.<!--&nbsp;...

Dopamine does not cross the [[blood–brain barrier]], so its synthesis and functions in peripheral areas are to a large degree independent of its synthesis and functions in the brain.<ref name="Nice-pharma"/> A substantial amount of dopamine circulates in the bloodstream, but its functions there are not entirely clear.<ref name=Eisenhofer/> Dopamine is found in blood plasma at levels comparable to those of [[epinephrine]], but in humans, over 95% of the dopamine in the plasma is in the form of dopamine [[sulfate]], a conjugate produced by the enzyme [[SULT1A3|sulfotransferase 1A3/1A4]] acting on free dopamine.<ref name=Eisenhofer/> The bulk of this dopamine sulfate is produced in the [[mesentery]] that surrounds parts of the digestive system.<ref name=Eisenhofer/>  The production of dopamine sulfate is thought to be a mechanism for detoxifying dopamine that is ingested as food or produced by the digestive process—levels in the plasma typically rise more than fifty-fold after a meal.<ref name=Eisenhofer/>  Dopamine sulfate has no known biological functions and is excreted in urine.<ref name=Eisenhofer/>

The relatively small quantity of unconjugated dopamine in the bloodstream may be produced by the [[sympathetic nervous system]], the digestive system, or possibly other organs.<ref name=Eisenhofer/> It may act on dopamine receptors in peripheral tissues, or be metabolized, or be converted to [[norepinephrine]] by the enzyme [[dopamine beta hydroxylase]], which is released into the bloodstream by the [[adrenal medulla]].<ref name=Eisenhofer/>  Some dopamine receptors are located in the walls of arteries, where they act as a [[vasodilation|vasodilator]] and an inhibitor of [[norepinephrine]] release.<ref name=Missale>{{cite journal | vauthors = Missale C, Nash SR, Robinson SW, Jaber M, Caron MG | title = Dopamine receptors: from structure to function | journal = Physiological Reviews | volume = 78 | issue = 1 | pages = 189–225 | year=1998 | pmid = 9457173}}</ref>  These responses might be activated by dopamine released from the [[carotid body]] under conditions of low oxygen, but whether arterial dopamine receptors perform other biologically useful functions is not known.<ref name=Missale/>

Beyond its role in modulating blood flow, there are several peripheral systems in which dopamine circulates within a limited area and performs an [[exocrine gland|exocrine]] or [[paracrine signalling|paracrine]] function.<ref name=Eisenhofer/>  The peripheral systems in which dopamine plays an important role include the [[immune system]], the [[kidney]]s and the [[pancreas]].

In the pancreas the role of dopamine is somewhat complex. The pancreas consists of two parts, an [[exocrine component of pancreas|exocrine]] and an [[pancreatic islets|endocrine]] component.  The exocrine part synthesizes and secretes [[digestive enzymes]] and other substances, including dopamine, into the [[small intestine]].<ref name=Rubi/> The function of this secreted dopamine after it enters the small intestine is not clearly established—the possibilities include protecting the intestinal mucosa from damage and reducing [[gastrointestinal motility]] (the rate at which content moves through the digestive system).<ref name=Rubi>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rubí B, Maechler P | title = Minireview: new roles for peripheral dopamine on metabolic control and tumor growth: let's seek the balance | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 151 | issue = 12 | pages = 5570–81 | year=2010 | pmid = 21047943 | doi = 10.1210/en.2010-0745 | url = http://endo.endojournals.org/content/151/12/5570.long |accessdate=24 September 2015}}</ref>

The [[pancreatic islets]] make up the endocrine part of the pancreas, and synthesize and secrete hormones including [[insulin]] into the bloodstream.<ref name=Rubi/> There is evidence that the [[beta cell]]s in the islets that synthesize insulin contain dopamine receptors, and that dopamine acts to reduce the amount of insulin they release.<ref name=Rubi/> The source of their dopamine input is not clearly established—it may come from dopamine that circulates in the bloodstream and derives from the sympathetic nervous system, or it may be synthesized locally by other types of pancreatic cells.<ref name=Rubi/>

===Psychosis and antipsychotic drugs===
{{main article|Psychosis}}
Psychiatrists in the early 1950s discovered that a class of drugs known as [[typical antipsychotic]]s (also known as major [[tranquilizer]]s), were often effective at reducing the [[psychotic]] symptoms of [[schizophrenia]].<ref name=Healy/> The introduction of the first widely used antipsychotic, [[chlorpromazine]] (Thorazine), in the 1950s, led to the release of many patients with schizophrenia from institutions in the years that followed.<ref name=Healy/> By the 1970s researchers understood that these typical antipsychotics worked as [[receptor antagonists|antagonists]] on the [[dopamine receptor D2|D2 receptors]].<ref name=Healy/><ref name=Brunton>{{cite book | last1 = Brunton | first1 = L | name-list-format = vanc | title = Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics|publisher=McGraw Hill|pages=417–455|edition=12th}}</ref> This realization led to the so-called [[dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia]], which postulates that schizophrenia is largely caused by hyperactivity of brain dopamine systems.<ref name=Howes>{{cite journal | vauthors = Howes OD, Kapur S | title = The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia: version III—the final common pathway | journal = Schizophrenia Bulletin | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 549–62 | year=2009 | pmid = 19325164 | pmc = 2669582 | doi = 10.1093/schbul/sbp006 }}</ref>  The dopamine hypothesis drew additional support from the observation that psychotic symptoms were often intensified by dopamine-enhancing [[stimulant]]s such as [[methamphetamine]], and that these drugs could also produce psychosis in healthy people if taken in large enough doses.<ref name=Howes/> In the following decades other [[atypical antipsychotics]] that had fewer serious [[side effect]]s were developed.<ref name=Healy/> Many of these newer drugs do not act directly on dopamine receptors, but instead produce alterations in dopamine activity indirectly.<ref name=Horacek>{{cite journal | vauthors = Horacek J, Bubenikova-Valesova V, Kopecek M, Palenicek T, Dockery C, Mohr P, Höschl C | title = Mechanism of action of atypical antipsychotic drugs and the neurobiology of schizophrenia | journal = CNS Drugs | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 389–409 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16696579 | doi=10.2165/00023210-200620050-00004}}</ref> These drugs were also used to treat other psychoses.<ref name=Healy>{{Cite book |title=The Creation of Psychopharmacology | vauthors = Healy D |year=2004 |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=37–73  |isbn=0-674-01599-1 }}</ref> [[Antipsychotic drugs]] have a broadly suppressive effect on most types of active behavior, and particularly reduce the delusional and agitated behavior characteristic of overt psychosis.<ref name=Brunton/> There remains substantial dispute, however, about how much of an improvement the patient experiences on these drugs.<ref name=James/>

There is evidence that this dopamine functions as an anti-[[herbivore]] defense, reducing consumption by snails and [[isopoda|isopods]].<ref name="pmid16489461">{{cite journal | vauthors = Van Alstyne KL, Nelson AV, Vyvyan JR, Cancilla DA | title = Dopamine functions as an antiherbivore defense in the temperate green alga Ulvaria obscura | journal = Oecologia | volume = 148 | issue = 2 | pages = 304–11 | year=2006 | pmid = 16489461 | doi = 10.1007/s00442-006-0378-3 }}</ref>

===As a precursor for melanin===
{{anchor|dopamine-melanin}}

[[Melanin]]s are a family of dark-pigmented substances found in a wide range of organisms.<ref name=Simon/> Chemically they are closely related to dopamine, and there is a type of melanin, known as '''dopamine-melanin''', that can be synthesized by oxidation of dopamine via the enzyme [[tyrosinase]].<ref name=Simon>{{cite journal | vauthors = Simon JD, Peles D, Wakamatsu K, Ito S | title = Current challenges in understanding melanogenesis: bridging chemistry, biological control, morphology, and function | journal = Pigment Cell & Melanoma Research | volume = 22 | issue = 5 | pages = 563–79 | year=2009 | pmid = 19627559 | doi = 10.1111/j.1755-148X.2009.00610.x }}</ref> The melanin that darkens human skin is not of this type: it is synthesized by a pathway that uses [[L-DOPA]] as a precursor but not dopamine.<ref name=Simon/> However, there is substantial evidence that the [[neuromelanin]] that gives a dark color to the brain's [[substantia nigra]] is at least in part dopamine-melanin.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fedorow H, Tribl F, Halliday G, Gerlach M, Riederer P, Double KL | title = Neuromelanin in human dopamine neurons: comparison with peripheral melanins and relevance to Parkinson's disease | journal = Progress in Neurobiology | volume = 75 | issue = 2 | pages = 109–24 | year=2005 | pmid = 15784302 | doi = 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2005.02.001 }}</ref>

Dopamine-derived melanin probably appears in at least some other biological systems as well.

==History and development==
{{Main article|History of catecholamine research}}
Dopamine was first synthesized in 1910 by [[George Barger]] and James Ewens at [[Wellcome Trust|Wellcome]] Laboratories in London, England<ref name="pmid18781671">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fahn S | title = The history of dopamine and levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease | journal = Movement Disorders | volume = 23 Suppl 3 | issue = | pages = S497–508 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18781671 | doi = 10.1002/mds.22028 }}</ref> and first identified in the human brain by [[Kathleen Montagu]] in 1957. It was named dopamine because it is a [[monoamine]] whose [[Precursor chemical|precursor]] in the Barger-Ewens synthesis is 3,4-'''d'''ihydr'''o'''xy'''p'''henyl'''a'''lanine (levodopa or [[L-DOPA]]). Dopamine's function as a neurotransmitter was first recognized in 1958 by [[Arvid Carlsson]] and [[Nils-Åke Hillarp]] at the Laboratory for Chemical Pharmacology of the National Heart Institute of [[Sweden]].<ref name="pmid11165672">{{cite journal | vauthors = Benes FM | title = Carlsson and the discovery of dopamine | journal = Trends in Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 46–7 | year=2001 | pmid = 11165672 | doi = 10.1016/S0165-6147(00)01607-2 }}</ref> Carlsson was awarded the 2000 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for showing that dopamine is not only a precursor of [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline) and [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline), but is also itself a neurotransmitter.<ref name=Barondes>{{cite book| first=Samuel H. | last=Barondes | name-list-format = vanc | year=2003| title=Better Than Prozac| pages=21–22, 39–40| location=New York| publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=0-19-515130-5}}</ref>

===Polydopamine===
Research motivated by [[bioadhesive|adhesive]] [[polyphenolic protein]]s in [[mussel]]s led to the discovery in 2007 that a wide variety of materials, if placed in a solution of dopamine at slightly basic [[pH]], will become coated with a layer of polymerized dopamine, often referred to as '''polydopamine'''.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Mussel-Inspired Surface Chemistry for Multifunctional Coatings |vauthors= Lee H, Dellatore SM, Miller WM, Messersmith PB |journal= Science |year=2007 |volume=318 |pages=426–430 |doi=10.1126/science.1147241|bibcode = 2007Sci...318..426L }}</ref><ref name=Dreyer>{{cite journal | title = Perspectives on poly(dopamine) | vauthors = Dreyer DR, Miller DJ, Freeman BD, Paul DR, Bielawski CW | journal = Chemical Sciences | year = 2013 | doi = 10.1039/C3SC51501J | volume=4 | page=3796}}</ref> This polymerized dopamine forms by a spontaneous oxidation reaction, and is formally a type of [[melanin]].<ref name=Lynge>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lynge ME, van der Westen R, Postma A, Städler B | title = Polydopamine—a nature-inspired polymer coating for biomedical science | journal = Nanoscale | volume = 3 | issue = 12 | pages = 4916–28 | year=2011 | pmid = 22024699 | doi = 10.1039/c1nr10969c | url = http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Almar_Postma/publication/51742922_Polydopamine--a_nature-inspired_polymer_coating_for_biomedical_science/file/d912f50318c9e0c7bb.pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140307205318/http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Almar_Postma/publication/51742922_Polydopamine--a_nature-inspired_polymer_coating_for_biomedical_science/file/d912f50318c9e0c7bb.pdf | archivedate = 7 March 2014 |accessdate=24 September 2015 | bibcode = 2011Nanos...3.4916L }}</ref> Synthesis usually involves reaction of dopamine hydrochloride with [[Tris]] as a base in water.

Polydopamine coatings can form on objects ranging in size from [[nanoparticle]]s to large surfaces.<ref name=Lynge/> Polydopamine layers have chemical properties that have the potential to be extremely useful, and numerous studies have examined their possible applications.<ref name=Lynge/> At the simplest level, they can be used for protection against damage by light, or to form capsules for drug delivery.<ref name=Lynge/> At a more sophisticated level, their adhesive properties may make them useful as substrates for [[biosensor]]s or other biologically active macromolecules.<ref name=Lynge/>
