'''Sarilumab''' (trade name '''Kevzara''') is a human [[monoclonal antibody]] against the [[interleukin-6]] [[Interleukin 6#Receptor|receptor]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Statement On A Nonproprietary Name Adopted By The USAN Council: Sarilumab| website= ama-assn.org |publisher= [[American Medical Association]]| url= http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/usan/sarilumab.pdf |subscription= yes}}</ref> [[Regeneron]] and [[Sanofi]] developed the drug for the treatment of [[rheumatoid arthritis]] (RA), for which it received US [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approval on 22 May 2017 and [[European Medicines Agency|EMA]] approval on 23 June 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/004254/human_med_002114.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d124|title=Kevzara: Authorisation details|publisher=[[European Medicines Agency]]|accessdate=28 September 2017}}</ref>

Development in [[ankylosing spondylitis]] has been suspended after the drug failed to show clinical benefit over [[methotrexate]] in a phase II trial.<ref name=SR2011>{{cite press release| url= http://investor.regeneron.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=590869| title= Sanofi and Regeneron Report Positive Phase 2b Trial Results with Sarilumab in Rheumatoid Arthritis| date= July 12, 2011| website= regeneron.com| publisher= Regeneron | location= Paris & Tarrytown, New York| access-date= }}</ref>

==Clinical trials==
===Rheumatoid arthritis===
On May 15, 2013, both companies announced that 2 new trials were starting (COMPARE and ASCERTAIN) and the first patients had already been enrolled.<ref>[http://en.sanofi.com/Images/33027_20130515_sari_en.pdf Sanofi and Regeneron Announce Patient Enrollment in Two Phase 3 Trials with Sarilumab in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).

In June 2015, a phase 3 trial (with [[methotrexate]]) for RA reported meeting its three coprimary endpoints.<ref name=J2015>{{cite journal |pmid=25733246 |title=Sarilumab Plus Methotrexate in Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis and Inadequate Response to Methotrexate: Results of a Phase III Study. |doi=10.1002/art.39093 |year=2015 |journal=Arthritis Rheumatol. |volume=67|issue=6 |pages=1424â€“37 }}</ref>

In Nov 2015, the SARIL-RA-TARGET trial reported good results (meeting both its coprimary end points).<ref name=P3-2015>[http://formularyjournal.modernmedicine.com/formulary-journal/news/sarilumab-effective-broad-range-ra-patients-study Sarilumab effective in broad range of RA patients: Study]</ref>

In Nov 2016, the ''MONARCH'' phase III trial comparing sarilimab to [[adalimumab]] (an anti-TNF) found sarilumab superior at reducing the [[DAS28]]-ESR score in patients with RA after 24 weeks.<ref name=MPT-monarch>{{cite journal| url= http://ard.bmj.com/content/76/5/840 |title= Efficacy and safety of sarilumab monotherapy versus adalimumab monotherapy for the treatment of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (MONARCH): a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group phase III trial | first1 = Gerd R |last1 = Burmester| first2 = Yong |last2 = Lin| first3 = Rahul |last3 = Patel| first4 = Janet |last4 = van Adelsberg| first5 = Erin K |last5 = Mangan| first6 = Neil M H |last6 = Graham| first7 = Hubert |last7 = van Hoogstraten| first8 = Deborah |last8 = Bauer| first9 = Juan Ignacio |last9 = Vargas| first10 = Eun Bong |last10 =  Lee | display-authors= 3| work= [[Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases]]| via= bmj.com | year= 2017 | volume= 76| number= 5| pages= 840-847| doi= 10.1136/annrheumdis-2016-210310}}</ref>

==History==
In October 2016 the [[US FDA]] refused approval (for RA) due to [[good manufacturing practice|GMP]] violations.<ref name=MPT-monarch/>

==Side effects==
The MONARCH trial suggested a significantly higher incidence of [[neutropenia]] in patients receiving 200 mg sarilumab every 2 weeks, compared to patients being treated with [[adalimumab]] (13.6% vs 0.5%). However, infection rates were similar between both groups (28.8% vs 27.7%).<ref name=MPT-monarch/>
