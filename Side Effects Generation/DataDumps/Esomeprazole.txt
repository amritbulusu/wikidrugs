<!-- Definition and medical uses -->
'''Esomeprazole''' sold under the brand name '''Nexium''' (or '''Nexum''') among others,<ref name=brands/> is a [[proton-pump inhibitor]] which reduces [[gastric acid|stomach acid]]. It is used in the treatment of [[dyspepsia]], [[peptic ulcer|peptic ulcer disease]], [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]], and [[Zollinger-Ellison syndrome]].

It decreases secretion of acid through inhibition of the [[Hydrogen potassium ATPase|H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase]] in the [[parietal cell]]s of the stomach. By inhibiting the functioning of this transporter, the drug prevents formation of stomach acid.

Esomeprazole is the (''S'')-(−)-[[enantiomer]] of [[omeprazole]]. Esomeprazole is currently sold over the counter in the US, the UK and Australia.

==Medical use==
The primary uses of esomeprazole are gastroesophageal reflux disease, treatment and maintenance of [[erosive esophagitis]], treatment of [[duodenal ulcers]] caused by ''H. pylori'', prevention of [[gastric ulcers]] in those on chronic [[NSAID]] therapy, and treatment of gastrointestinal ulcers associated with [[Crohn's disease]].<ref name=AHFS>{{cite web | title = Esomeprazole Magnesium | url = http://www.drugs.com/monograph/esomeprazole-magnesium.html | work = The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists | accessdate = 3 April 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Li J, Zhao J, Hamer-Maansson JE, Andersson T, Fulmer R, Illueca M, Lundborg P | title = Pharmacokinetic properties of esomeprazole in adolescent patients aged 12 to 17 years with symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease: A randomized, open-label study | journal = Clin Ther | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 419–27  | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16750456 | doi = 10.1016/j.clinthera.2006.03.010 }}</ref>

===Gastroesophageal reflux disease===
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition in which the digestive acid in the stomach comes in contact with the [[esophagus]]. The irritation caused by this disorder is known as [[heartburn]]. Long-term contact between gastric acids and the esophagus can cause permanent damage to the esophagus. Esomeprazole reduces the production of digestive acids, thus minimizing their effect on the esophagus.

===Duodenal ulcers===
Esomeprazole is combined with the antibiotics [[clarithromycin]] and [[amoxicillin]] (or [[metronidazole]] instead of amoxicillin in penicillin-hypersensitive patients) in a 10-day eradication triple therapy for ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]''. Infection by ''H. pylori'' is a causative factor in the majority of [[Peptic ulcer|peptic and duodenal ulcers]].

===Efficacy===
A 2006 meta analysis concluded that compared to other proton pump inhibitors, esomeprazole confers a statistically significant but clinically modest overall benefit in esophageal healing and symptom relief.  When broken down by disease severity, the benefit of esomeprazole relative to other proton pump inhibitors was negligible in patients with mild disease (number needed to treat 50), but appeared more substantial in those with severe disease (number needed to treat 8).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gralnek IM, Dulai GS, Fennerty MB, Spiegel BM | title = Esomeprazole versus other proton pump inhibitors in erosive esophagitis: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials | journal = Clin.

==Adverse effects==
Common side effects include headache, diarrhea, nausea, flatulence, decreased appetite, constipation, dry mouth, and abdominal pain. More severe side effects are severe allergic reactions, chest pain, dark urine, fast heartbeat, fever, paresthesia, persistent sore throat, severe stomach pain, unusual bruising or bleeding, unusual tiredness, and yellowing of the eyes or skin.<ref>{{cite web | title = Nexium side effects | url = http://www.drugs.com/sfx/nexium-side-effects.html | work = Drug information online | publisher = Drugs.com | accessdate = 2009-06-23 }}</ref>

== Interactions ==
Esomeprazole is a [[enzyme inhibitor|competitive inhibitor]] of the enzyme [[CYP2C19]], and may therefore [[drug interaction|interact]] with drugs that depend on it for [[drug metabolism|metabolism]], such as [[diazepam]] and [[warfarin]]; the concentrations of these drugs may increase if they are used concomitantly with esomeprazole.<ref name=Stedman>{{cite journal | vauthors = Stedman CA, Barclay ML | title = Review article: comparison of the pharmacokinetics, acid suppression and efficacy of proton pump inhibitors | journal = Aliment.

Drugs that depend on stomach pH for absorption may interact with omeprazole; drugs that depend on an acidic environment (such as [[ketoconazole]] or [[atazanavir]]) will be poorly absorbed, whereas drugs that are broken down in acidic environments (such as [[erythromycin]]) will be absorbed to a greater extent than normal.<ref name=Stedman/>

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Single 20– to 40-mg oral doses generally give rise to peak plasma esomeprazole concentrations of 0.5-1.0&nbsp;mg/l within 1–4 hours, but after several days of once-daily administration, these levels may increase by about 50%. A 30-minute intravenous infusion of a similar dose usually produces peak plasma levels on the order of 1–3&nbsp;mg/l. The drug is rapidly cleared from the body, largely by urinary excretion of pharmacologically inactive metabolites such as 5-hydroxymethylesomeprazole and 5-carboxyesomeprazole. Esomeprazole and its metabolites are analytically indistinguishable from omeprazole and the corresponding omeprazole metabolites unless chiral techniques are employed.<ref>R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 388-389.</ref>

== Dosage forms ==

[[Image:Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium) pills.JPG|thumb|Some 40-mg Nexium brand esomeprazole magnesium capsules]]
Esomeprazole is available as delayed-release capsules in the United States or as delayed-release tablets in Australia, the United Kingdom, and Canada (containing esomeprazole magnesium) in strengths of 20 and 40&nbsp;mg, as delayed-release capsules in the United States (containing esomeprazole strontium) in a 49.3&nbsp;mg strength (delivering the equivalent of 40&nbsp;mg of esomeprazole,<ref name="urlDailyMed">{{cite web | url = http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=61a5a84e-0194-4f11-91f8-83d7ac404932 | title =  esomeprazole strontium capsule, delayed release | work = DailyMed }}</ref> and as esomeprazole sodium for [[intravenous]] injection/infusion. Oral esomeprazole preparations are [[enteric coating|enteric-coated]], due to the rapid degradation of the drug in the [[acid]]ic conditions of the [[stomach]]. This is achieved by formulating capsules using the multiple-unit pellet system.

Eesomeprazole magnesium is also combined with [[naproxen]] (under the brand name '''Vimovo<sup>®</sup>''') for the prevention of gastric ulcers associated with chronic NSAID therapy.  Vimovo is available in 2 dosage strengths: 500/20&nbsp;mg. & 375/20&nbsp;mg.  Pivotal clinical trials of Vimovo (at the 6 month end point) demonstrated an incidence of GI ulcer in 24% of patients on naproxen (alone) versus 7% on naproxen/esomeprazole.<ref name=ViomovoLabel>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/022511s017lbl.pdf Viomo label]</ref>  The FDA has added warnings to the label for Viomovo concerning [[acute interstitial nephritis]], risk of [[kidney]] problems in some patients.<ref>FDA [http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/ucm262248.htm Vimovo label updates]</ref>

=== Multiple-unit pellet system ===
Esomeprazole capsules, as well as Losec/Prilosec tablets, are formulated as a "multiple-unit pellet system" (MUPS). Essentially, the [[Capsule (pharmacy)|capsule]] consists of extremely small enteric-coated granules (pellets) of the esomeprazole formulation inside an outer shell. When the capsule is immersed in an aqueous solution, as happens when the capsule reaches the stomach, water enters the capsule by [[osmosis]]. The contents swell from water absorption, causing the shell to burst, and releasing the enteric-coated granules. For most patients, the multiple-unit pellet system is of no advantage over conventional enteric-coated preparations.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Patients for whom the formulation is of benefit include those requiring [[nasogastric tube]] feeding and those with difficulty swallowing ([[dysphagia]]).{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Economics===
Between the launch of esomeprazole in 2001 and 2005, the drug has netted AstraZeneca about $14.4 billion.<ref>Financial impact information: [http://www.astrazeneca.com/sites/7/imagebank/typeArticleparam511672/astrazeneca-2005-annual-review.pdf 2005, $4.6 billion]; [http://www.astrazeneca.com/sites/7/imagebank/typearticleparam511562/astrazeneca-2004-annual-report.pdf 2004, $3.9 billion]; [http://www.astrazeneca.com/sites/7/imagebank/typearticleparam503063/AstraZeneca%20Annual%20Report%202003.pdf 2003, $3.3 billion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040728120928/http://www.astrazeneca.com/sites/7/imagebank/typearticleparam503063/AstraZeneca%20Annual%20Report%202003.pdf |date=2004-07-28 }}; [http://www2.astrazeneca.com/annualrep2002/pdf/694617_Report_front.pdf 2002, $2 billion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030608161027/http://www.astrazeneca.com/annualrep2002/pdf/694617_Report_front.pdf |date=2003-06-08 }}; [http://www2.astrazeneca.com/annualrep2001/pdf/first.pdf 2001, launch and $580 million]{{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}.</ref>

=== Controversy ===
{{main article|AstraZeneca#Nexium|l1=AstraZeneca's marketing of Nexium}}
There has been some controversy about [[AstraZeneca]]'s behaviour in creating, patenting, and marketing of the drug. Esomeprazole's successful predecessor, [[omeprazole]], is a mixture of two [[Chirality (chemistry)|mirror-imaged molecules]] (esomeprazole which is the S-enantiomer, and R-omeprazole); critics said the company was trying to "[[Evergreening|evergreen]]" its omeprazole patent by patenting the pure esomeprazole and aggressively marketing to doctors that it is more effective than the mixture.<ref>{{cite journal | title = High Prices: How to think about prescription drugs | first = Malcolm | last = Gladwell | authorlink = Malcolm Gladwell | url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/10/25/041025crat_atlarge | magazine = [[The New Yorker]] | date = 2004-10-25 | accessdate = 2006-06-23 }}</ref>

[[Thomas A. Scully]], head of the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]], also criticized AstraZeneca for their aggressive marketing of Nexium. At a conference of the [[American Medical Association]], he said that Astra was using the new drug to overcharge consumers and insurance companies.

=== Brand names ===
Generic versions of esomeprazole magnesium are available worldwide.<ref name=brands/> It is available [[over-the-counter]] under the brand name Nexium in the United States<ref>{{Cite web | url =http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/nonprescription-nexium-heartburn-medicine-launches-23883946  | title = Nonprescription Nexium Heartburn Medicine Launches | date = May 27, 2014 | publisher = ABC News}}</ref> and in the UK.
