'''Vernakalant''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]; codenamed '''RSD1235''', proposed tradenames '''Kynapid''' and '''Brinavess''') is an investigational drug under regulatory review for the acute conversion of [[atrial fibrillation]]. It was initially developed by [[Cardiome Pharma]], and the [[intravenous]] formulation was bought for further development by [[Merck & Co.|Merck]] in April 2009.<ref name="FierceBiotech">{{cite news|url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/press-releases/merck-and-cardiome-pharma-sign-license-agreement-vernakalant-investigational-drug-tre|title=Merck and Cardiome Pharma Sign License Agreement for Vernakalant, an Investigational Drug for Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation|date=9 April 2009|accessdate=12 October 2010|publisher=FierceBiotech}}</ref> In September 2012, Merck terminated its agreements with Cardiome and has consequently returned all rights of the drug back to Cardiome.

On 11 December 2007, the Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee of the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) voted to recommend the approval of vernakalant,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drugs.com/nda/kynapid_071212.html |title=FDA Advisory Committee Recommends Approval of Kynapid for Acute Atrial Fibrillation
 |accessdate=2008-03-15 |publisher=Drugs.com }}</ref> but in August 2008 the FDA judged that additional information was necessary for approval.<ref name="FierceBiotech" /> 
The drug (under brand name Brinavess) was approved in Europe on 1 September 2010.<ref>{{cite press release

An oral formulation underwent Phase II [[clinical trial]]s between 2005 and 2008.<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00267930|Study of RSD1235-SR for the Prevention of Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter Recurrence}}</ref><ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00526136|Vernakalant (Oral) Prevention of Atrial Fibrillation Recurrence Post-Conversion Study}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Like other [[Antiarrhythmic agent#Class III agents|class III antiarrhythmics]], vernakalant blocks [[atrial]] [[potassium channel]]s, thereby prolonging repolarization. It differs from typical class III agents by blocking a certain type of potassium channel, the [[cardiac transient outward potassium current]], with increased potency as the [[heart rate]] increases. This means that it is more effective at high heart rates, while other class III agents tend to lose effectiveness under these circumstances. It also slightly blocks the [[hERG]] potassium channel, leading to a prolonged [[QT interval]]. This may theoretically increase the risk of [[ventricular tachycardia]], though this does not seem to be clinically relevant.<ref name="Finnin">{{cite |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/725628_4|title=Vernakalant: A Novel Agent for the Termination of Atrial Fibrillation: Pharmacology|publisher=Medscape Today|author=Miki Finnin|accessdate=12 October 2010}}</ref>

The drug also blocks atrial [[sodium channel]]s.<ref name="Finnin" />

It's mainly used for rapid conversion of acute-onset AF (AF lasting 3 to 72 hours)

==Metabolism==
Vernakalant is cleared by both renal and hepatic mechanisms. Majority via cytochrome CYP2D6 and excreted as glucuronide. Elimination half life is 3-4 hours.
