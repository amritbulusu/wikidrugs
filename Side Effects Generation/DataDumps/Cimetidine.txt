===Overdose===
Cimetidine appears to be very safe in [[overdose]], producing no [[symptom]]s even with massive overdoses (e.g., 20 g).<ref name="Dart2004" />

== Interactions ==

* Cimetidine affects the metabolism of [[methadone]], sometimes resulting in higher blood levels and a higher incidence of side effects, and may interact with the [[antimalarial]] medication [[hydroxychloroquine]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Furst DE | title = Pharmacokinetics of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine during treatment of rheumatic diseases | journal = Lupus | volume = 5 Suppl 1 | issue =  | pages = S11-5 | date = June 1996 | pmid = 8803904 | doi = 10.1177/096120339600500104 }}</ref>
* Cimetidine can also interact with a number of psychoactive medications, including [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s and [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s, causing increased blood levels of these drugs and the potential of subsequent toxicity.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}
* Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and [[Area under the curve (pharmacokinetics)|area-under-curve]] of [[zolmitriptan]] and its [[active metabolite]]s were roughly doubled.<ref>See complete drug interactions for Zomig (zolmitriptan succinate used for migraine relief) in package insert: {{cite web | url = http://www1.astrazeneca-us.com/pi/Zomig.pdf | title = Highlights of Zomig  Prescribing  Information | publisher = AstraZeneca }}</ref>
* Cimetidine is a potent inhibitor of tubular [[creatinine]] secretion. Creatinine is a metabolic byproduct of [[creatine]] breakdown. Accumulation of creatinine is associated with [[uremia]], but the symptoms of creatinine accumulation are unknown, as they are hard to separate from other nitrogenous waste buildups.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Urakami Y, Kimura N, Okuda M, Masuda S, Katsura T, Inui K | title = Transcellular transport of creatinine in renal tubular epithelial cell line LLC-PK1 | journal = Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 200–5 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15988122 | doi = 10.2133/dmpk.20.200 }}</ref>
* Like several other medications, the most obvious being [[erythromycin]], cimetidine interferes with the body's metabolization of [[sildenafil]], causing its strength and duration to increase (therefore also its side effects to be more likely and prominent).{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}
* Clinically significant drug interactions with the CYP1A2 substrate [[theophylline]], the CYP2C9 substrate [[tolbutamide]], the CYP2D6 substrate [[desipramine]], and the CYP3A4 substrate [[triazolam]] have all been demonstrated with cimetidine, and interactions with other substrates of these enzymes are likely as well.<ref name="Rodrigues2008">{{cite book | first = A.

* Cimetidine inhibits the [[renal]] [[excretion]] of [[metformin]] and [[procainamide]], resulting in increased circulating levels of these drugs.<ref name="RitterLewis2008" />
* Interactions of potential clinical importance with cimetidine include [[warfarin]], [[theophylline]], [[phenytoin]], [[carbamazepine]], [[pethidine]] and other [[opioid]] [[analgesic]]s, [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s, [[lidocaine]], [[terfenadine]], [[amiodarone]], [[flecainide]], [[quinidine]], [[fluorouracil]], and [[benzodiazepine]]s.<ref name="RitterLewis2008" /><ref name="RosenfeldLoose2007" />
* Cimetidine may decrease the effects of CYP2D6 substrates that are [[prodrug]]s, such as [[codeine]], [[tramadol]], and [[tamoxifen]].<ref name="FullerSajatovic2005">{{cite book | first1 = Matthew A. | last1 = Fuller| first2 = Martha | last2 = Sajatovic | name-list-format = vanc | title = Drug Information Handbook for Psychiatry | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LzBtAAAAMAAJ | year = 2005 | publisher = Lexi-Comp | page = 285 }}</ref>
* Cimetidine reduces the [[Absorption (pharmacokinetics)|absorption]] of [[ketoconazole]] and [[itraconazole]] (which require a low [[pH]]).<ref name="RitterLewis2008" />
* Cimetidine has a theoretical but unproven benefit in [[paracetamol toxicity]].<ref name="Kelly2009" /> This is because [[N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine]] (NAPQI), a [[metabolite]] of [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) that is responsible for its [[hepatotoxicity]], is formed from it by the cytochrome P450 system (specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4).<ref name="CameronFeuer2012">{{cite book | first1 = Ross | last1 = Cameron | first2 = George | last2 = Feuer | first3 = Felix | last3 = de la Iglesias | name-list-format = vanc | title = Drug-Induced Hepatotoxicity | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZf-CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA140 | date = 6 December 2012 | publisher = Springer Science & Business Media | isbn = 978-3-642-61013-4 | pages = 140– }}</ref>

Both human FMO1 and FMO3 S-oxygenate a number of nucleophilic sulfur-containing substrates and in some cases, does so with great stereoselectivity.&nbsp;... For amines with smaller aromatic substituents such as phenethylamines, often these compounds are efficiently N-oxygenated by human FMO3.&nbsp;... (S)-Nicotine N-1'-oxide formation can also be used as a highly stereoselective probe of human FMO3 function for adult humans that smoke cigarettes. Finally, cimetidine S-oxygenation or ranitidine N-oxidation can also be used as a functional probe of human FMO3.

==History==
Cimetidine, approved by the FDA for inhibition of gastric acid secretion, has been advocated for a number of dermatological diseases.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Scheinfeld N | title = Cimetidine: a review of the recent developments and reports in cutaneous medicine | journal = Dermatology Online Journal | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 4 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12639457 }}</ref> Cimetidine was the prototypical histamine [[H2-receptor antagonist|H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonist]] from which the later members of the class were developed. Cimetidine was the culmination of a project at Smith, Kline and French (SK&F) Laboratories in Welwyn Garden City (now part of   [[GlaxoSmithKline]]) by [[James W. Black]], [[C. Robin Ganellin]], and others to develop a [[histamine receptor]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] to suppress stomach acid secretion.<ref name="ACS Landmarks">{{cite web |url = http://portal.acs.org/portal/PublicWebSite/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/cimetidinetagamet/ |title = Tagamet<sup>®</sup>: Discovery of Histamine H<sub>2</sub>-receptor Antagonists |publisher = American Chemical Society |work = National Historic Chemical Landmarks |accessdate = June 25, 2012 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20121209003707/http://portal.acs.org/portal/PublicWebSite/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/cimetidinetagamet/ |archivedate = December 9, 2012 |df =  }}</ref> This was one of the first drugs discovered using a [[rational drug design]] approach. Sir James W. Black shared the 1988 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of [[propranolol]] and also is credited for the discovery of cimetidine.

At the time (1964), [[histamine]] was known to stimulate the secretion of stomach acid, but also that traditional [[antihistamine]]s had no effect on acid production. In the process, the SK&F scientists also proved the existence of histamine H<sub>2</sub> receptors.

The SK&F team used a rational drug-design structure starting from the structure of histamine — the only design lead, since nothing was known of the then hypothetical H<sub>2</sub> receptor. Hundreds of modified compounds were synthesized in an effort to develop a model of the receptor. The first breakthrough was ''N<sup>α</sup>''-guanylhistamine, a partial H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonist. From this lead, the receptor model was further refined and eventually led to the development of [[burimamide]], the first H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonist. Burimamide, a specific [[competitive antagonist]] at the H<sub>2</sub> receptor, 100 times more potent than ''N<sup>α</sup>''-guanylhistamine, proved the existence of the H<sub>2</sub> receptor.

Burimamide was still insufficiently potent for oral administration, and further modification of the structure, based on modifying the [[pKa]] of the compound, led to the development of [[metiamide]]. Metiamide was an effective agent; it was associated, however, with unacceptable [[nephrotoxicity]] and [[agranulocytosis]].<ref name="ACS Landmarks"/> The toxicity was proposed to arise from the [[thiourea]] group, and similar [[guanidine]] analogues were investigated until the ultimate discovery of cimetidine. The compound was synthesized in 1972 and evaluated for toxicology by 1973. It passed all trials.

Cimetidine was first marketed in the United Kingdom in 1976, and in the U.S. in August 1977; therefore, it took 12 years from initiation of the H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonist program to commercialization. By 1979, Tagamet was being sold in more than 100 countries and became the top-selling prescription product in the U.S., Canada, and several other countries. In November 1997, the American Chemical Society and the Royal Society of Chemistry in the U.K. jointly recognized the work as a milestone in drug discovery by designating it an International Historic Chemical Landmark during a ceremony at SmithKline Beecham's New Frontiers Science Park research facilities in Harlow, England.<ref name="Freemantle">{{cite web | last = Fremantle | first = Michael | name-list-format = vanc | title = Tagamet|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/83/8325/8325tagamet.html | work = Chemical and Engineering news | accessdate = 1 July 2013 }}</ref>

The commercial name "Tagamet" was decided upon by fusing the two words "an'''tag'''onist" and "ci'''met'''idine".<ref name="ACS Landmarks"/> Subsequent to the introduction onto the U.S. drug market, two other H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists were approved, [[ranitidine]] (Zantac, Glaxo Labs) and [[famotidine]] (Pepcid, Yamanouchi, Ltd.)  Cimetidine became the first drug ever to reach more than $1 billion a year in sales, thus making it the first [[Pharmaceutical drug#Blockbuster drug|blockbuster drug]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guernicamag.com/features/111/me_too_drugs/ |title=Pharmaceutical Sales 101: Me-Too Drugs |last=Whitney |first=Jake |name-list-format=vanc |work=[[Guernica Magazine|Guernica]] |date=February 2006 |accessdate=2008-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807114344/http://www.guernicamag.com/features/111/me_too_drugs/ |archivedate=2008-08-07 |df= }}</ref>
