'''Ramelteon''', marketed as '''Rozerem''' by [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company|Takeda Pharmaceuticals North America]], is a sleep agent that selectively binds to the [[melatonin receptor|MT<sub>1</sub> and MT<sub>2</sub> receptors]] in the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (SCN), instead of binding to [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub>]] receptors, such as with drugs like [[zolpidem]].

It however does not appear to speed the onset of sleep or the amount of sleep a person gets.<ref name=Bra2015>{{cite journal|last1=Brasure|first1=M|last2=MacDonald|first2=R|last3=Fuchs|first3=E|last4=Olson|first4=CM|last5=Carlyle|first5=M|last6=Diem|first6=S|last7=Koffel|first7=E|last8=Khawaja|first8=IS|last9=Ouellette|first9=J|last10=Butler|first10=M|last11=Kane|first11=RL|last12=Wilt|first12=TJ|title=Management of insomnia disorder|journal=Comparative Effectiveness Reviews|volume=159|date=December 2015|pmid=26844312}}</ref> It is approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for long-term use.

Ramelteon does not show any appreciable binding to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, which are associated with [[anxiolytic]], [[myorelaxant]], and [[amnesia|amnesic]] effects.

==Medical uses==
Ramelteon can be used for [[insomnia]], particularly delayed sleep onset. It however does not appear to speed the onset of sleep or the amount of sleep a person gets.<ref name=Bra2015/>

A systematic review, published in 2014, concluded "ramelteon was found to be beneficial in preventing delirium in medically ill individuals when compared to placebo."<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen |date=March 2015 |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=119–129 |doi=10.1177/1533317514539379 |title=Melatonin and melatonin agonist for delirium in the elderly patients |authors=Chakraborti D, Tampi DJ, Tampi RR |pmid=24946785}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Ramelteon has not been shown to produce dependence and has shown no potential for abuse, and the withdrawal and [[rebound insomnia]] that is typical with [[GABA]] modulators is not present in ramelteon.

Six percent of ramelteon-treated patients in clinical trials discontinued due to an adverse event, compared to 2% in the placebo arms. The most frequent adverse events leading to discontinuation were somnolence, dizziness, nausea, fatigue, headache, and insomnia.  The United States official Prescribing Information warns of rare cases of anaphylactic reactions, abnormal thinking, and suicide in patients with pre-existing depression.

In mice treated with ramelteon for two years, increases in liver and testicular tumors were observed, but only at doses at least 20 times greater than the recommended human dose on a milligram/kilogram basis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2010/021782s011lbl.pdf |title=www.accessdata.fda.gov |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Drug interactions==

Ramelteon has been evaluated for potential drug interactions with the following medications and showed no significant effects: [[omeprazole]], [[theophylline]], [[dextromethorphan]], and [[midazolam]], [[digoxin]] and [[warfarin]]. There were no clinically meaningful effects when ramelteon was coadministered with any of these drugs.

A drug interaction study showed that there were no clinically meaningful effects or an increase in adverse events when ramelteon and the SSRI [[Prozac]] (fluoxetine) were coadministered. When coadministered with ramelteon, [[fluvoxamine]] (strong [[CYP1A2]] inhibitor) increased [[Area under the curve (pharmacokinetics)|AUC]] approximately 190-fold, and the [[Cmax (pharmacology)|C<sub>max</sub>]] increased approximately 70-fold, compared to ramelteon administered alone. Ramelteon and [[fluvoxamine]] should not be coadministered.<ref>{{cite web|title=ROZEREM (ramelteon) Tablets. Full Prescribing Information|url=http://general.takedapharm.com/content/file/PI.pdf?applicationCode=5237EE08-766E-492D-B0F7-01CDB6161181&fileTypeCode=ROZEREMPI|website=Rozerem – Prescription Sleep Aid|publisher=Takeda Pharmaceuticals America, Inc.}}</ref>

{{Significant drug interaction}}

Ramelteon should be administered with caution in patients taking other [[CYP1A2]] inhibitors, strong [[CYP3A4]] inhibitors such as [[ketoconazole]], and strong [[CYP2C9]] inhibitors such as [[fluconazole]].

Efficacy may be reduced when ramelteon is used in combination with potent [[Cytochrome P450 oxidase|CYP]] enzyme inducers such as [[rifampin]], since ramelteon concentrations may be decreased.

==Mechanism of action==
Ramelteon is a melatonin receptor [[agonist]] with both high affinity for [[Melatonin receptor|melatonin MT<sub>1</sub> and MT<sub>2</sub> receptors]] and [[Functional selectivity|selectivity]] over the MT<sub>3</sub> receptor. Ramelteon demonstrates full agonist activity ''in vitro''  in cells expressing human MT<sub>1</sub> or MT<sub>2</sub> receptors, and high selectivity for human MT<sub>1</sub> and MT<sub>2</sub> receptors compared to the MT<sub>3</sub> receptor.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Owen RT |title=Ramelteon: profile of a new sleep-promoting medication |journal=Drugs Today |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=255–63 |date=April 2006 |pmid=16703122 |doi=10.1358/dot.2006.42.4.970842 }}</ref>

The activity of ramelteon at the MT<sub>1</sub> and MT<sub>2</sub> receptors is believed to contribute to its sleep-promoting properties, as these receptors, acted upon by endogenous melatonin, are thought to be involved in the maintenance of the circadian rhythm underlying the normal sleep-wake cycle. Ramelteon has no appreciable affinity for the GABA receptor complex or for receptors that bind [[neuropeptide]]s, [[cytokine]]s, [[serotonin]], [[dopamine]], [[noradrenaline]], [[acetylcholine]], and [[opioid]]s. Ramelteon also does not interfere with the activity of a number of selected enzymes in a standard panel.

The major [[metabolite]] of ramelteon, M-II, is active and has approximately one tenth and one fifth the binding affinity of the parent molecule for the human MT<sub>1</sub> and MT<sub>2</sub> receptors, respectively, and is 17–25-fold less potent than ramelteon in ''in vitro'' functional assays. Although the potency of M-II at MT<sub>1</sub> and MT<sub>2</sub> receptors is lower than the parent drug, M-II circulates at higher concentrations than the parent producing 20–100-fold greater mean systemic exposure when compared to ramelteon. M-II has weak affinity for the serotonin 5-HT<sub>2B</sub>  receptor, but no appreciable affinity for other receptors or enzymes. Similar to ramelteon, M-II does not interfere with the activity of a number of endogenous enzymes.

No published studies have indicated whether ramelteon, in humans, is more or less safe or effective than the hormone [[melatonin]] which it mimics; melatonin is much less expensive and is widely available over-the-counter in the US and Canada.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cardinali DP, Srinivasan V, Brzezinski A, Brown GM |title=Melatonin and its analogs in insomnia and depression |journal=J.
