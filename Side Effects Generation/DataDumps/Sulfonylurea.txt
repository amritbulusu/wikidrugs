'''Sulfonylureas''' (UK: '''sulphonylurea''') are a class of [[organic compound]]s used in medicine and agriculture.  They are [[antidiabetic drugs]] widely used in the management of [[diabetes mellitus]] [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2]]. They act by increasing [[insulin]] release from the [[beta cell]]s in the [[pancreas]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Seino S | title = Cell signalling in insulin secretion: the molecular targets of ATP, cAMP and sulfonylurea | journal = Diabetologia | volume = 55 | issue = 8 | pages = 2096–108 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22555472 | doi = 10.1007/s00125-012-2562-9 }}</ref> A number of sulfonylureas are also used as [[herbicide]]s ("weedkiller"), because they can interfere with [[plant]] [[biosynthesis]] of certain [[amino acids]].<ref name="pmid18234503">{{cite journal | vauthors = Duggleby RG, McCourt JA, Guddat LW | title = Structure and mechanism of inhibition of plant acetohydroxyacid synthase | journal = Plant Physiology and Biochemistry : PPB | volume = 46 | issue = 3 | pages = 309–24 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18234503 | doi = 10.1016/j.plaphy.2007.12.004 }}</ref> Sulfonylureas are also used experimentally to inhibit [[interleukin 1 beta]] release from the [[NALP3]] (or NLRP3) [[inflammasome]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Coll R | title = A small-molecule inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 248–255 | date = March 2015 | doi = 10.1038/nm.3806 }}</ref>

==Medical uses==
Sulfonylureas are used primarily for the treatment of [[diabetes mellitus]] type 2. Sulfonylureas are ineffective where there is absolute deficiency of insulin production such as in type 1 diabetes or post-pancreatectomy.

Sulfonylureas can be used to treat some types of neonatal diabetes.  While historically people with hyperglycemia and low blood insulin levels were diagnosed with Type I Diabetes by default, it has been found that patients who receive this diagnosis before 6 months of age are often, in fact, candidates for receiving sulfonylureas rather than insulin throughout life.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Greeley SA, Tucker SE, Naylor RN, Bell GI, Philipson LH | title = Neonatal diabetes mellitus: a model for personalized medicine | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 21 | issue = 8 | pages = 464–72 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20434356 | pmc = 2914172 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2010.03.004 }}</ref>

While prior sulfonylureas were associated with worse outcomes, newer agents do not appear to increase the risk of death, heart attacks, or strokes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rados DV, Pinto LC, Remonti LR, Leitão CB, Gross JL | title = Correction: The Association between Sulfonylurea Use and All-Cause and Cardiovascular Mortality: A Meta-Analysis with Trial Sequential Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = e1002091 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27340828 | pmc = 4920361 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002091 }}</ref>

==Side effects==
Sulfonylureas, as opposed to [[metformin]], the [[thiazolidinedione]]s, [[exenatide]], [[symlin]] and other newer treatment agents may induce [[hypoglycemia]] as a result of excesses in insulin production and release. This typically occurs if the dose is too high, and the patient is fasting. Some people attempt to change eating habits to prevent this, however it can be counter productive.

Like [[insulin]], sulfonylureas can induce weight gain, mainly as a result of their effect to increase insulin levels and thus utilization of glucose and other metabolic fuels. Other side-effects are: gastrointestinal upset, [[headache]] and [[hypersensitivity]] reactions.

The safety of sulfonylurea therapy in pregnancy is unestablished.  Prolonged hypoglycemia (4 to 10 days) has been reported in children borne to mothers taking sulfonylureas at the time of delivery.<ref name="www.accessdata.fda.gov">{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/017532s030lbl.pdf |title=www.accessdata.fda.gov |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> Impairment of liver or kidney function increase the risk of hypoglycemia, and are contraindications. As other anti-diabetic drugs cannot be used either under these circumstances, insulin therapy is typically recommended during pregnancy and in hepatic and renal failure, although some of the newer agents offer potentially better options.

A 2014 Cochrane review found tentative evidence that people treated with sulfonylureas have fewer non-fatal cardiovascular events than those treated with metformin (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.93) but a higher risk of severe hypoglycemia (RR 5.64, 95% CI 1.22 to 26.00).  There was not enough data available to determine the relative risk of mortality or of cardiovascular mortality.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hemmingsen B, Schroll JB, Wetterslev J, Gluud C, Vaag A, Sonne DP, Lundstrøm LH, Almdal T | title = Sulfonylurea versus metformin monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes: a Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials and trial sequential analysis | journal = CMAJ Open | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = E162-75 | date = Jul 2014 | pmid = 25295236 | pmc = 4185978 | doi = 10.9778/cmajo.20130073 }}</ref> An earlier review by the same group found a statistically significant increase in the risk of cardiovascular death for first generation sulfonylureas relative to placebo (RR 2.63, 95% CI 1.32 to 5.22; P = 0.006) but there was not enough data to determine the relative risk of first generation sulfonylureas relative to insulin (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.71; P = 0.39).

==Interactions==

Drugs that potentiate or prolong the effects of sulfonylureas and therefore increase the risk of hypoglycemia include [[acetylsalicylic acid]] and derivatives, [[allopurinol]], [[sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]]s, and [[fibrate]]s. Drugs that worsen [[glucose tolerance]], contravening the effects of antidiabetics, include [[corticosteroid]]s, [[isoniazid]], [[oral contraceptive]]s and other [[estrogen]]s, [[sympathomimetic]]s, and [[thyroid hormone]]s. Sulfonylureas tend to interact with a wide variety of other drugs, but these interactions, as well as their clinical significance, vary from substance to substance.<ref name="AustriaCodex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag| location=Vienna| year=2009| edition=2009/2010| isbn=3-85200-196-X|language=German | name-list-format = vanc }}</ref><ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile">{{cite book  | title = Arzneistoff-Profile | editor1-last = Dinnendahl | editor1-first = V.| editor2-last = Fricke     | editor2-first = U. | publisher    = Govi Pharmazeutischer Verlag | location     = Eschborn, Germany | year = 2010 | edition      = 23 | volume       = 4 | isbn         = 978-3-7741-9846-3 | language = German | name-list-format = vanc }}</ref>

==Structure==
All pharmacological sulfonylureas contain a central ''S''-arylsulfonylurea structure with a ''p''-substituent on the phenyl ring ('''R<sup>1</sup>''') and various groups terminating the urea ''N''′ end group ('''R<sup>2</sup>'''). Chemically, this functionality can be easily installed by reacting [[aryl]] [[sulfonamides]] (R<sup>1</sup>—C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>—SO<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>) with [[isocyanates]] (R<sup>2</sup>—NCO).

==Mechanism of action==
[[File:Glucose Insulin Release Pancreas.svg|thumb|Diagram of glucose reduction and insulin release in the pancreas]]

Sulfonylureas bind to and close [[ATP-sensitive potassium channel|ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup>]] (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channels on the cell membrane of pancreatic [[beta cell]]s, which depolarizes the cell by preventing potassium from exiting. This [[depolarization]] opens voltage-gated [[calcium|Ca]]<sup>2+</sup> channels. The rise in intracellular calcium leads to increased fusion of [[insulin]] granulae with the cell membrane, and therefore increased secretion of (pro)insulin.<ref name="pmid12475777">{{cite journal | vauthors = Proks P, Reimann F, Green N, Gribble F, Ashcroft F | title = Sulfonylurea stimulation of insulin secretion | journal = Diabetes | volume = 51 | issue = Suppl 3 | pages = S368–76 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12475777 | doi = 10.2337/diabetes.51.2007.S368 }}</ref>

There is some evidence that sulfonylureas also sensitize β-cells to glucose, that they limit glucose production in the [[liver]], that they decrease lipolysis (breakdown and release of [[fatty acid]]s by [[adipose tissue]]) and decrease clearance of insulin by the liver.{{citation needed||date=June 2016}}

The K<sub>ATP</sub> channel is an octameric complex of the [[inward-rectifier potassium ion channel]] K<sub>ir</sub>6.x and [[sulfonylurea receptor]] SUR which associate with a [[stoichiometry]] of 4:4. {{citation needed||date=June 2016}}

Furthermore, it has been shown that sulfonylureas interact with the nucleotide exchange factor [[RAPGEF4|Epac2]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang CL, Katoh M, Shibasaki T, Minami K, Sunaga Y, Takahashi H, Yokoi N, Iwasaki M, Miki T, Seino S | title = The cAMP sensor Epac2 is a direct target of antidiabetic sulfonylurea drugs | journal = Science | volume = 325 | issue = 5940 | pages = 607–10 | date = Jul 2009 | pmid = 19644119 | doi = 10.1126/science.1172256 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi T, Shibasaki T, Takahashi H, Sugawara K, Ono A, Inoue N, Furuya T, Seino S | title = Antidiabetic sulfonylureas and cAMP cooperatively activate Epac2A | journal = Science Signaling | volume = 6 | issue = 298 | pages = ra94 | date = Oct 2013 | pmid = 24150255 | doi = 10.1126/scisignal.2004581 }}</ref> Mice lacking this factor exhibited a decreased glucose-lowering effect upon sulfonylurea treatment.

==Sulfonylureas used as herbicides==
A large number of sulfonylureas are used as [[herbicide]]s.  They function by interfering with biosynthesis of the amino acids valine, isoleucine, and leucine.  Some of the brand names of these compounds are [[amidosulfuron]], [[azimsulfuron]], [[bensulfuron-methyl]], [[chlorimuron-ethyl]], [[chlorsulfuron]], [[ethametsulfuron-methyl]], [[cinosulfuron]], [[ethoxysulfuron]], [[flazasulfuron]], [[flupyrsulfuron-methyl-sodium]], [[imazosulfuron]], [[metsulfuron-methyl]], [[nicosulfuron]], [[oxasulfuron]], [[primisulfuron-methyl]], [[prosulfuron]], [[pyrazosulfuron-ethyl]], [[rimsulfuron]], [[Sulfometuron methyl|sulfometuron-methyl]], [[sulfosulfuron]], [[thifensulfuron-methyl]], [[triasulfuron]], [[tribenuron-methyl]], and [[triflusulfuron-methyl]].<ref>Arnold P.
