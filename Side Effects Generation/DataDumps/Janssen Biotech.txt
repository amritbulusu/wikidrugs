'''Janssen Biotech, Inc.''', formerly '''Centocor Biotech, Inc.''', is a biotechnology company that was founded in [[Philadelphia]] in 1979 with an initial goal of developing new diagnostic assays using [[monoclonal antibody]] technology.

==History==
In 1982 Centocor transitioned into a publicly traded company. Subsequently, the company moved to a larger facility in [[Malvern, Pennsylvania]] (a northwest suburb of Philadelphia). In 1984, Centocor opened an overseas plant in [[Leiden]], the [[Netherlands]].

In 1997, eighteen years after its foundation, Centocor achieved its first year of operating profitability.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} 
In 1998, Centocor sold its diagnostic division to [[Fujirebio|Fujirebio, Inc.]].<ref>[http://www.fdi.com/documents/news/103098.pdf Centocor reaches agreement to sell oncology diagnostics business], 1998 press release</ref>

In 1999, Centocor became a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Johnson & Johnson]], the worldwide manufacturer and marketer of healthcare products. 
Since being acquired by Johnson and Johnson, Centocor has increased its annual sales from approximately $500 million to more than $2 billion. During the same period, research and development investment increased from $75 million to more than $300 million.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 2004 Centocor purchased a new manufacturing plant in St. Louis, Missouri, and is currently opening a new manufacturing facility in County Cork, Ireland. The Dutch plant has been expanded substantially with a $250 million investment in additional production facilities, which were opened in 2006.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 2007, Centocor broke new ground in advertising by releasing [[Innerstate]], believed to be the first theatrically released documentary film both created and entirely funded by a drug company, to promote Remicade ([[Infliximab]]).<ref name="Saul">Stephanie Saul. "Drug Gets a Cameo in a Film Backed by Its Maker", New York Times, February 21, 2007. https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/21/business/media/21adco.html</ref>

In 2008, Centocor, Inc. and Ortho Biotech Inc. merged to form Centocor Ortho Biotech Inc.

In June 2010 Centocor Ortho Biotech acquired RespiVert, a privately held [[drug discovery]] company focused on developing small-molecule, inhaled therapies for the treatment of pulmonary diseases.<ref>[http://www.infogrok.com/index.php/pharmaceutical/centocor-ortho-biotech-acquires-respivert.html Centocor Ortho Biotech Acquires RespiVert] News article from InfoGrok.</ref>

In June 2011 Centocor Ortho Biotech changed its name to Janssen Biotech, Inc. as part of a global effort to unite the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies around the world under a common identity.

In December 2014, the company announced it would co-develop [[MacroGenics]] cancer drug candidate ([[MGD011]]) which targets both [[CD19]] and [[CD3 (immunology)|CD3]] proteins in treating [[B-cell]] malignant tumours. This could net MacroGenics up to $700 million.<ref>http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/janssen-joins-macrogenics-in-up-to-700m-cancer-collaboration/81250728/</ref>

In January 2015, the company announced it will utilise [[Isis Pharmaceutical]]s' Rna-targeting technology to discover and develop [[antisense]] drugs targeting autoimmune disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, with the partnership potentially generating up to $835 million for Isis.<ref>http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/janssen-isis-pharma-ink-up-to-835m-antisense-agreement/81250763/</ref>

==Products==

In 1984 Centocor developed their first product approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) â€” a diagnostic test used to detect the [[rabies]] [[virus]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 1998 the company launched its top-selling monoclonal antibody [[Remicade]] ([[infliximab]]) for its first FDA approved indication in [[Crohn's Disease]]. Subsequently, Remicade's market has expanded with approvals for [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[ankylosing spondylitis]], [[psoriatic arthritis]], [[ulcerative colitis]], and [[pediatric]] Crohn's disease. Remicade was approved for plaque psoriasis in September 2006.

Centocor also markets ReoPro ([[abciximab]]), a biologic agent indicated as an adjunct to coronary [[angioplasty]] ([[Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty|PTCA]]).

In 2009, the U.S. FDA approved [[Simponi]], a human monoclonal antibody for treatment for arthritis, which was co-developed with [[Medarex]], Inc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2009-05-04/marcial-medarex-a-bright-spot-in-biotechbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice|title=Marcial: Medarex, a Bright Spot in Biotech|last=Marcial|first=Gene|website=businessweek.com|date=4 May 2009|accessdate= 24 Sep 2014}}</ref>
