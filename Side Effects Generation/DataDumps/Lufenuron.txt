'''Lufenuron''' is the [[active ingredient]] in the [[Veterinary medicine|veterinary]] [[flea]] control medication Program, and one of the two active ingredients in the flea, [[heartworm]], ringworm and [[anthelmintic]] medicine [[milbemycin oxime/lufenuron]] (Sentinel).

Lufenuron is stored in the animal's body [[fat]] and transferred to adult fleas through the host's blood when they feed. Adult fleas transfer it to their growing eggs through their blood, and to hatched larvae feeding on their excrement. It does not kill adult fleas.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Lufenuron, a [[benzoylurea]] pesticide, inhibits the production of [[chitin]] in insects.  Without chitin, a larval flea will never develop a hard outer shell ([[exoskeleton]]). With its inner organs exposed to air, the insect dies from dehydration soon after hatching or molting (shedding its old, smaller shell).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Lufenuron is also used to fight [[fungus|fungal]] infections, since fungus cell walls are about one third chitin.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ben-Ziony |first1=Yair |last2=Arzi |first2=Boaz |title=Use of lufenuron for treating fungal infections of dogs and cats: 297 cases (1997-1999) |journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association |volume=217 |issue=10 |pages=1510â€“3 |year=2000 |pmid=11128542 |doi=10.2460/javma.2000.217.1510 }}</ref>

Lufenuron is also sold as an agricultural pesticide for use against [[lepidoptera]]ns, eriophid [[mites]], and [[western flower thrips]]. It is an effective antifungal in plants.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
