{{colend}}

'''Uncommon (0.1–1% frequency):'''
* Convulsions
* [[Ataxia]]
* [[Arrhythmias]]
* Elevated blood pressure
* Activation of psychotic symptoms

'''Very rare (<0.01% frequency):'''
{{colbegin}}
* [[Pancytopaenia]] — an abnormally low amount of all the different types of blood cells in the blood (including platelets, white blood cells and red blood cells). 
* [[Leukopenia|Leucopenia]] — a low white blood cell count.
* [[Agranulocytosis]] — basically a worse form of leucopaenia; a dangerously low [[white blood cell]] count which leaves one open to life-threatening infections due to the role of the white blood cells in defending the body from invaders. 
* [[Thrombocytopenia]] — an abnormally low amount of [[platelets]] in the blood which are essential to clotting and hence this leads to an increased tendency to bruise and bleed, including, potentially, internally. 
* [[Eosinophilia]] — an abnormally high number of eosinophils — the cells that fight off parasitic infections — in the blood.
* [[Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone]] (SIADH) — a potentially fatal reaction to certain medications that is due to an excessive release of [[antidiuretic hormone]] — a hormone that prevents the production of urine by increasing the reabsorption of fluids in the kidney — this results in the development of various electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. hyponatraemia [low blood sodium], hypokalaemia [low blood potassium], [[hypocalcaemia]] [low blood calcium]). 
* [[Glaucoma]]
* [[Oedema]] (local or generalised)
* [[Alopecia]] (hair loss)
* [[Hyperpyrexia]] (a high fever that is above 41.5&nbsp;°C)
* [[Hepatitis]] (liver swelling) with or without [[jaundice]] — the yellowing of the eyes, the skin, and mucous membranes due to impaired liver function. 
* Abnormal ECG
* Anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions including hypotension
* [[Neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] (NMS) — a potentially fatal side effect of antidopaminergic agents such as antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants and antiemetics (drugs that relieve nausea and vomiting). NMS develops over a period of days or weeks and is characterised by the following symptoms:
** [[Tremor]]
** Muscle rigidity
** Mental status change (such as confusion, delirium, mania, hypomania, agitation, coma, etc.)
** Hyperthermia (high body temperature)
** Tachycardia (high heart rate)
** Blood pressure changes
** Diaphoresis (sweating profusely)
** Diarrhoea
* Alveolitis allergic ([[pneumonitis]]) with or without [[eosinophilia]]
* Purpura
{{colend}}
* Conduction disorder (e.g. widening of QRS complex, prolonged QT interval, PQ changes, bundle-branch block, torsade de pointes, particularly in patients with hypokalaemia)

===Withdrawal===
Withdrawal symptoms may occur during gradual or particularly abrupt withdrawal of tricyclic antidepressant drugs. Possible symptoms include: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, insomnia, headache, nervousness, anxiety, dizziness and worsening of psychiatric status.<ref name = TGA/> Differentiating between the return of the original psychiatric disorder and clomipramine withdrawal symptoms is important.<ref name="Zemishlany-1992">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Zemishlany | first1 = Z. | last2 = Aizenberg | first2 = D. | last3 = Hermesh | first3 = H. | last4 = Weizman | first4 = A. | title = [Withdrawal reactions after clomipramine]. | journal = Harefuah | volume = 123 | issue = 7-8 | pages = 252–5, 307 |date=Oct 1992 | doi =  | PMID = 1459499 }}</ref> Clomipramine withdrawal can be severe.<ref name="Kraft-1977">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Kraft|first1 = TB. | title = [Severe withdrawal symptoms following use of clomipramine]. | journal = Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd | volume = 121|issue = 33 | pages = 1293 |date=Aug 1977 | doi =  | PMID = 895917 }}</ref> Withdrawal symptoms can also occur in [[neonates]] when clomipramine is used during pregnancy.<ref name="Bloem-1999">{{Cite journal | last1 = Bloem | first1 = BR. | last2 = Lammers | first2 = GJ. | last3 = Roofthooft | first3 = DW. | last4 = De Beaufort | first4 = AJ. | last5 = Brouwer | first5 = OF. | title = Clomipramine withdrawal in newborns. | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1720967/pdf/v081p00F77a.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Arch Dis Child Fetal Neonatal Ed | volume = 81 | issue = 1 | pages = F77 | date = Jul 1999 | PMID = 10744432 | pmc = 1720967 | doi = 10.1136/fn.81.1.f77a | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170908174254/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1720967/pdf/v081p00F77a.pdf | archivedate = 2017-09-08 | df =  }}</ref> A major mechanism of withdrawal from tricyclic antidepressants is believed to be due to a [[rebound effect]] of excessive [[cholinergic]] activity due to neuroadaptations as a result of chronic inhibition of cholinergic receptors by tricyclic antidepressants.

==Overdose==
{{Main|Tricyclic antidepressant overdose}}

Clomipramine overdose usually presents with the following symptoms:<ref name = DM/><ref name = TGA/><ref name = EMC/>
{{colbegin|3}}
* Signs of [[central nervous system]] depression such as: 
** stupor
** coma
** drowsiness
** restlessness
** ataxia
* Mydriasis
* Convulsions
* Enhanced reflexes
* Muscle rigidity
* Athetoid and choreoathetoid movements
* [[Serotonin syndrome]] - a condition with many of the same symptoms as neuroleptic malignant syndrome but has a significantly more rapid onset
* Cardiovascular effects including:
** arrhythmias (including Torsades de pointes)
** tachycardia
** [[QTc interval]] prolongation
** conduction disorders
** hypotension
** shock
** [[heart failure]]
** cardiac arrest
* [[Apnoea]]
* [[Cyanosis]]
* Respiratory depression
* Vomiting
* Fever
* Sweating
* [[Oliguria]]
* [[Anuria]]

There is no specific antidote for overdose and all treatment is purely supportive and symptomatic.<ref name = TGA/> Treatment with [[activated charcoal]] may be used to limit absorption in cases of oral overdose.<ref name = TGA/> Anyone suspected of overdosing on clomipramine should be hospitalised and kept under close surveillance for at least 72 hours.<ref name = TGA/> Clomipramine has been reported as being less toxic in overdose than most other TCAs in one meta-analysis but this may well be due to the circumstances surrounding most overdoses as clomipramine is more frequently used to treat conditions for which the rate of suicide is not particularly high such as OCD.<ref>{{cite journal | author1 = White, N | author2 = Litovitz, T | author3 = Clancy, C | date = December 2008 | title = Suicidal antidepressant overdoses: a comparative analysis by antidepressant type | journal = Journal of Medical Toxicology | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = 238–250 | pmid = 19031375 | pmc = 3550116 | doi = 10.1007/BF03161207 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3550116/pdf/13181_2009_Article_BF03161207.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170908174254/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3550116/pdf/13181_2009_Article_BF03161207.pdf | archivedate = 2017-09-08 | df =  }}</ref> In another meta-analysis, however, clomipramine was associated with a significant degree of toxicity in overdose.<ref>{{cite journal | date = May 2010 | last1 = Hawton | first1 = K. | last2 = Bergen | first2 = H. | last3 = Simkin | first3 = S. | last4 = Cooper | first4 = J. | last5 = Waters | first5 = K. | last6 = Gunnell | first6 = D. | last7 = Kapur | first7 = N. | title = Toxicity of antidepressants: rates of suicide relative to prescribing and non-fatal overdose | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 196 | issue = 5 | pages = 354–358 | pmid = 20435959 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.109.070219 | pmc = 2862059 | url = http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/196/5/354.full.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate =  | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111125105800/http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/196/5/354.full.pdf | archivedate = 2011-11-25 | df =  }}</ref>

==Interactions==
Clomipramine may interact with a number of different medications, including the [[monoamine oxidase inhibitors]] which include [[isocarboxazid]], [[moclobemide]], [[phenelzine]], [[selegiline]] and [[tranylcypromine]], [[antiarrhythmic agents]] (due to the effects of TCAs like clomipramine on cardiac conduction. There is also a potential [[pharmacokinetic]] interaction with [[quinidine]] due to the fact that clomipramine is metabolised by [[CYP2D6]] ''in vivo''), [[diuretics]] (due to the potential for [[hypokalaemia]] (low blood potassium) to develop which increases the risk for QT interval prolongation and [[torsades de pointes]]), the [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs; due to both potential additive serotonergic effects leading to [[serotonin syndrome]] and the potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction with the SSRIs that inhibit [[CYP2D6]] [e.g. fluoxetine and paroxetine]) and serotonergic agents such as triptans, other tricyclic antidepressants, tramadol, etc. (due to the potential for serotonin syndrome).<ref name = TGA/> Its use is also advised against in those concurrently on [[CYP2D6]] inhibitors due the potential for increased plasma levels of clomipramine and the resulting potential for [[Central nervous system|CNS]] and cardiotoxicity.<ref name = TGA/>

Clomipramine is a [[reuptake inhibitor]] of [[serotonin]] and [[norepinephrine]], or a [[serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] (SNRI); that is, it blocks the [[reuptake]] of these [[neurotransmitter]]s back into [[neuron]]s by preventing them from interacting with their [[neurotransmitter transporter|transporter]]s, thereby increasing their [[extracellular]] concentrations in the [[synaptic cleft]] and resulting in increased [[serotonergic]] and [[noradrenergic]] [[neurotransmission]].<ref name="Stahl2013" /><ref name="pmid9537821" /> In addition, clomipramine also has [[antiadrenergic]], [[antihistamine]], [[antiserotonergic]], [[antidopaminergic]], and [[anticholinergic]] activities. It is specifically an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of the [[alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor]], the [[histamine]] [[H1 receptor|H<sub>1</sub> receptor]], the [[serotonin]] [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]], [[5-HT2C receptor|5-HT<sub>2C</sub>]], [[5-HT3 receptor|5-HT<sub>3</sub>]], [[5-HT6 receptor|5-HT<sub>6</sub>]], and [[5-HT7 receptor|5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor]]s, the [[dopamine]] [[D1 receptor|D<sub>1</sub>]], [[D2 receptor|D<sub>2</sub>]], and [[D3 receptor|D<sub>3</sub> receptor]]s, and the [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor]]s ([[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1|M<sub>1</sub>]]–[[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M5|M<sub>5</sub>]]).<ref name="pmid6086881" /><ref name="pmid11454918" /> Like other TCAs, clomipramine weakly [[sodium channel blocker|blocks]] [[voltage-dependent sodium channel]]s as well.<ref name="Stahl2013" /><ref name="Zohar2012" /><ref name="ResslerPine2015">{{cite book|author1=Kerry Ressler|author2=Daniel Pine|author3=Barbara Rothbaum|title=Anxiety Disorders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OJlJCAAAQBAJ&pg=PT254|date=15 April 2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-939514-9|pages=254–|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908174253/https://books.google.com/books?id=OJlJCAAAQBAJ&pg=PT254|archivedate=8 September 2017|df=}}</ref>
