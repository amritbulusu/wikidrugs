==Pharmacology==

===''In vitro'' research===
An ''[[in vitro]]'' [[yeast]] [[structure-activity relationship]]s [[bioassay]] study found that altrenogest was the most potent [[agonist]] of both the [[progesterone receptor]] (PR) and the [[androgen receptor]] (AR) of a large selection of other progestogens as well as [[anabolic-androgenic steroid]]s (AAS).<ref name="pmid18395441">{{cite journal | vauthors = McRobb L, Handelsman DJ, Kazlauskas R, Wilkinson S, McLeod MD, Heather AK | title = Structure-activity relationships of synthetic progestins in a yeast-based in vitro androgen bioassay | journal = J.

Although very potent in both activities ''in vitro'', the AR/PR activational potency ratio of altrenogest was in the same range as that of other 19-nortestosterone progestins such as [[norethisterone]], [[noretynodrel]], [[norgestrel]], and allylestrenol (ratio for all < 1.0), whereas the AR/PR activational potency ratio of its 17α-deallylated AAS [[structural analog|analogue]] trenbolone was, at 64, profoundly increased (although the ratio of metribolone (the 17α-methylated variant of altrenogest), at 0.56, was almost the same as that of altrenogest).<ref name="pmid18395441" />

==Chemistry==
{{See also|List of steroidal progestogens}}

Altrenogest is an [[estrane]] (C18) [[steroid]] and [[19-nortestosterone]] derivative known chemically as '''17α-allyl-19-nor-δ<sup>9,11</sup>-testosterone''' or '''17α-allylestra-4,9,11-trien-17β-ol-3-one'''. It is one of only two marketed progestins that possesses a 17α-allyl group, the other being [[allylestrenol]]. Most other progestins possess a 17α-[[ethynyl group]], while AAS, if they are 17α-substituted, are usually [[17α-alkylated anabolic steroid|17α-alkylated]] (with a [[methyl group|methyl]] or [[ethyl group]]). Altrenogest is the 17α-allylated derivative of the AAS [[trenbolone]] (and hence can also be referred to as '''allyltrenbolone''' or '''allyltrienolone'''), which itself is the 9,11-didehydro [[structural analog|analogue]] of the AAS [[nandrolone]] (19-nortestosterone).
