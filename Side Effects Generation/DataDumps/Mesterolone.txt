'''Mesterolone''' is a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]], [[oral administration|orally active]] [[anabolic-androgenic steroid]] (AAS) and [[chemical derivative|derivative]] of [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT). It is sold under the brand names '''Proviron''' (as '''Provironum''' in [[Asia-Pacific]] region) and '''Mestoranum''', by [[Bayer Schering Pharma]] (earlier by [[Schering AG|Schering]]). In the late 1970s and early 1980s, it was used with some success in controlled studies of men suffering from various forms of depression. Mesterolone is a relatively weak androgen and is rarely used for replacement therapies.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Nieschlag E, Behre HM, Bouchard P, etal |title=Testosterone replacement therapy: current trends and future directions |journal=Hum. Reprod. Update |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=409–19 |year=2004 |pmid=15297434 |doi=10.1093/humupd/dmh035 |url=http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/10/5/409}}</ref>

==Non-medical uses==

===Bodybuilding===
Mesterolone had seen widespread use in [[bodybuilding]] primarily for [[antiestrogen]]ic activity in [[anabolic steroid]] stacks  but such use has declined after introduction of [[aromatase inhibitors]] and [[Selective estrogen-receptor modulator|SERMs]]. Most significant benefits of current Mesterolone use are considered by bodybuilders to be maintaining [[libido]] off-cycle and also relatively and temporarily improving [[vascularity]].<ref>[http://thinksteroids.com/steroid-profiles/proviron/ Meso-RX Steroid Profiles - Proviron (Mesterolone)]</ref>

==Side effects==
{{See also|Anabolic steroid#Adverse effects}}

==Pharmacology==
Mesterolone is described as a very poor anabolic agent due to inactivation by [[3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]] (3α-HSD) in [[skeletal muscle]] [[tissue (biology)|tissue]], similarly to DHT and [[mestanolone]] (17α-methyl-DHT).<ref name="Llewellyn2009">{{cite book|author=William Llewellyn|title=Anabolics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=afKLA-6wW0oC|year=2009|publisher=Molecular Nutrition Llc|isbn=978-0967930473|pages=19,20,369}}</ref> In contrast, testosterone is a very poor [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] for 3α-HSD, and so is not similarly inactivated in skeletal muscle.<ref name="Llewellyn2009" />

Mesterolone is not a substrate for [[aromatase]], and so cannot be converted into an [[estrogen]].<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /> As such, it has no propensity for producing estrogenic [[side effect]]s such as [[gynecomastia]] or [[water retention (medicine)|fluid retention]].<ref name="Llewellyn2009" />

Because mesterolone is not [[17α-alkylated anabolic steroid|17α-alkylated]], it has little or no potential for [[hepatotoxicity]], although its risk of deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system are comparable to those of several other oral steroids.<ref name="Llewellyn2009" />

==Pharmacokinetics==
The C1α [[methyl group]] of mesterolone inhibits its [[liver|hepatic]] [[metabolism]] and thereby confers [[oral administration|oral]] activity, although its oral [[bioavailability]] is still low relative to that of 17α-alkylated AAS.<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /> In any case, mesterolone is one of the few non-17α-alkylated AAS that is active with oral ingestion.<ref name="Llewellyn2009" />

Mesterolone, also known as '''1α-methyl-4,5α-dihydrotestosterone''' ('''1α-methyl-DHT''') or as '''1α-methyl-5α-androstan-17β-ol-3-one''', is a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]] [[androstane]] [[steroid]] and [[chemical derivative|derivative]] of DHT.<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /> It is specifically DHT with a [[methyl group]] at the C1α position.<ref name="Llewellyn2009" />

==Research==
In one small scale clinical trial of depressed patients, an improvement of symptoms which included anxiety, lack of drive and desire was observed.<ref name= Itil >{{cite journal |vauthors=Itil TM, Michael ST, Shapiro DM, Itil KZ |title=The effects of mesterolone, a male sex hormone in depressed patients (a double blind controlled study) |journal=Methods Find Exp Clin Pharmacol |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=331–7 |date=June 1984 |pmid=6431212 }}</ref>  In patients with [[dysthymia]], [[unipolar depression|unipolar]], and [[bipolar depression]] significant improvement was observed.<ref name= Itil/> In this series of studies, mesterolone lead to a significant decrease in [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]] and [[testosterone]] levels. In another study, 100&nbsp;mg mesterolone cypionate was administered twice monthly. With regards to plasma T levels, there was no difference between the treated vs untreated group, and baseline [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]] levels were minimally affected.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kövary PM, Lenau H, Niermann H, Zierden E, Wagner H |title=Testosterone levels and gonadotrophins in Klinefelter's patients treated with injections of mesterolone cipionate |journal=Arch Dermatol Res |volume=258 |issue=3 |pages=289–94 |date=May 1977 |pmid=883846 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m4374818w9337427 |doi=10.1007/bf00561132}}</ref>
