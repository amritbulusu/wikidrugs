'''Mecloqualone''' ('''Nubarene''', '''Casfen''') is a quinazolinone-class [[Gabaergic|GABAergic]] and is an analogue of [[methaqualone]] that was first made in 1960<ref>{{Cite journal

}}</ref> in contrast to methaqualone, which was used as a general-purpose anxiolytic as well. Mecloqualone was never as widely used as methaqualone and is no longer prescribed because of concerns about its potential for abuse and overdose. In the United States it is a Schedule I non-narcotic (depressant) controlled substance with an ACSCN of 2572 and zero annual aggregate manufacturing quota.
