'''Elesclomol''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], codenamed '''STA-4783''') is a drug that triggers [[apoptosis]] (programmed cell death) in [[cancer]] cells. It is being developed by [[Synta Pharmaceuticals]] and [[GlaxoSmithKline]] as a [[chemotherapy adjuvant]], and has received both [[FDA Fast Track Development Program|fast track]] and [[orphan drug]] status from the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] for the treatment of [[metastasis|metastatic]] [[melanoma]].<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/95590.php |title=Synta And GlaxoSmithKline Announce Elesclomol Granted Orphan Drug Designation By The FDA |date=January 30, 2008 |publisher=Medical News Today}} Retrieved November 30, 2008.</ref>  Synta Pharmaceuticals announced on February 26, 2009 the suspension of all clinical trials involving Elesclomol due to safety concerns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ir.syntapharma.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=147988&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1260685&highlight= |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712134533/http://ir.syntapharma.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=147988&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1260685&highlight= |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 12, 2012 |title=Synta Pharmaceuticals press release |date=February 26, 2009 }}</ref> In March 2010, Synta announced that the FDA had approved resuming clinical development of elesclomol, and that they expected to initiate one or more clinical trials for elesclomol in the second half of the year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.genengnews.com/industry-updates/synta-announces-elesclomol-clinical-development-to-resume/76708891/ | title=Synta Announces Elesclomol Clinical Development to Resume | date = March 2, 2010 }}</ref>

In a small, [[randomized controlled trial|randomized]] phase II [[clinical trial|study]], elesclomol was shown to [[statistical significance|significantly]] increase [[progression-free survival]] in people with metastatic melanoma when given in addition to [[paclitaxel]] (Taxol).<ref name=ProusMOTM>{{cite web |url=http://www.prous.com/molecules/default.asp?ID=166 |title=Prous Science Molecule of the Month: Elesclomol |date=December 2007 |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220080357/http://www.prous.com/molecules/default.asp?ID=166 |archivedate=2008-02-20 |df= }} Retrieved November 30, 2008.</ref><ref name="pmid19609669">{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10549-009-0470-6 |pmid=19609669 |title=Elesclomol, counteracted by Akt survival signaling, enhances the apoptotic effect of chemotherapy drugs in breast cancer cells |journal=Breast Cancer Research and Treatment |volume=121 |issue=2 |pages=311–21 |year=2009 |last1=Qu |first1=Ying |last2=Wang |first2=Jinhua |last3=Sim |first3=Myung-Shin |last4=Liu |first4=Bingya |last5=Giuliano |first5=Armando |last6=Barsoum |first6=James |last7=Cui |first7=Xiaojiang }}</ref>

Results from a phase III trial were announced in March 2013. The study was halted when it was determined that addition of elesclomol to paclitaxol didn't significantly increase progression-free survival.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1200/JCO.2012.44.5585 |pmid=23401447 |title=Final Results of Phase III SYMMETRY Study: Randomized, Double-Blind Trial of Elesclomol Plus Paclitaxel Versus Paclitaxel Alone As Treatment for Chemotherapy-Naive Patients with Advanced Melanoma |journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology |volume=31 |issue=9  |pages=1211–8 |year=2013 |last1=O'Day |first1=S.

==Mechanism of action==
Elesclomol induces [[oxidative stress]] by provoking a buildup of [[reactive oxygen species]] within cancer cells.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-0298 |pmid=18723479 |title=Elesclomol induces cancer cell apoptosis through oxidative stress |journal=Molecular Cancer Therapeutics |volume=7 |issue=8 |pages=2319–27 |year=2008 |last1=Kirshner |first1=J.

The Cu(II) complex is 34 times more potent than the Ni(II) complex and 1040-fold more potent than the Pt(II) complex.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2013.04.013 |pmid=23707906 |title=Molecular mechanisms of the biological activity of the anticancer drug elesclomol and its complexes with Cu(II), Ni(II) and Pt(II) |journal=Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry |volume=126 |pages=1–6 |year=2013 |last1=Yadav |first1=Arun A. |last2=Patel |first2=Daywin |last3=Wu |first3=Xing |last4=Hasinoff |first4=Brian B. }}</ref>

==Discovery==
Elesclomol was first synthesized at Shinogi BioResearch in Lexington, MA. It's efficiency against cancer was discovered by scientists at Shionogi BioResearch. “It was pure chemist’s joy,” Synta's Chen said. “Homemade, random, and clearly made for no particular purpose. It was the only one that worked on everything we tried.”<ref name=newyorker>{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/05/17/the-treatment-2 |title=The Treatment - Why is it so difficult to develop drugs for cancer? |date=May 17, 2010  |publisher=[[The New Yorker]]}} Retrieved September 13, 2014.</ref>
