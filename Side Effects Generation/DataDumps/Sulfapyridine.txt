'''Sulfapyridine''', original UK spelling '''sulphapyridine''', is a [[sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]] [[antibacterial]]. At one time it was commonly referred to as '''M&B'''.

'''Sulfapyridine''' is no longer prescribed for treatment of infections in [[humans]].  However, it may be used to treat [[linear IgA bullous dermatosis|linear IgA disease]].  It is a good [[antibacterial]] drug, but its water [[solubility]] is very [[pH]] dependent.  Thus there is a risk of [[crystallization]] within the [[bladder]] or [[urethra]], which could lead to pain or blockage. As with other [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides]], there is a significant risk of [[agranulocytosis]], and this, rather than the development of resistance by bacteria, is the main reason for its decline in use.

It was discovered by [[Lionel Whitby]] at the British firm [[May & Baker]] Ltd and logged in their Test Book on 2 November, 1937 under Code No M&B 693.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lesch|first=John|title=The First Miracle Drugs|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|edition=illustrated|chapter=Chapter 7|isbn=0-19-518775-X}}</ref> 

The drug [[sulfasalazine]] is structurally one molecule of [[mesalamine]] linked to one molecule of sulfapyridine with an azo bond.

M&B 693 was one of the first generation of sulphonamide antibiotics. It has been reported as the first chemical cure for pneumonia. It could either be taken in tablet form or the powder could be placed in wounds. It was used so widely during the Second World War that May & Baker had difficulty keeping up with demand. It was later largely superseded by [[penicillin]] and other [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides]].
