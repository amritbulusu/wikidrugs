'''Sulfathiazole''' is an [[organosulfur compound]] used as a short-acting [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfa drug]]. It is an organic compound. Formerly,  it was a common oral and topical [[antimicrobial]], until less toxic alternatives were discovered. It is still occasionally used, sometimes in combination with [[sulfabenzamide]] and [[sulfacetamide]] in [[aquarium]]s.

It exists in various forms ([[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]]s).  The imine [[tautomer]] is dominant, at least in the solid state.  In this tautomer, the proton resides on the ring nitrogen.<ref>G. J. Kruger and G. Gafner "The crystal structure of sulphathiazole II" Acta Crystallogr. (1971). B27, 326-333.{{doi|10.1107/S0567740871002176}}</ref>

==Cultural references==
Sulfathiazole is mentioned in chapter 104 of [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s novel [[Cat's Cradle]] and New Dictionary, and several of his short stories.  [[Thomas Heggen]]'s 1946 novel [[Mister Roberts (novel)|Mister Roberts]] mentions the use of sulfathiazole to treat [[gonorrhea]], and Sonya Dorman's short story [[When I was Miss Dow]] in 1966.  Also the 1988 movie Dead Heat mentions the chemical as a drug used with reanimation of dead bodies. In Otto Preminger's 1960 movie [[Exodus (1960 film)|Exodus]], American nurse Kitty Fremont tells Dr. Odenheimer that sulfathiazole is the treatment for impetigo.  Dr. Odenheimer tells her that sulfathiazole is not available on the ship; soaking of the lesions and exposure to sunlight "is also a cure."

Sulfathiazole is mentioned in "The World According To Garp" in chapter 1 where Garps mother witnesses it being dispensed to World War II soldiers.

F.Spencer Chapman D.S.O. in his account of WW2, "The Jungle is Neutral", refers on p.108 to his personal use of sulphathiazole (M.&B.) in the jungles of Malaya during May 1942. He credits the use of the drug with preventing fever and pneumonia becoming fatal in the arduous conditions  during the guerilla actions undertaken by the Malayan Communist Party against the Japanese occupying forces.At this period there was no support or communication from Allied forces.<ref>F. Spencer Chapman D.S.O. book "The Jungle is Neutral" </ref>
