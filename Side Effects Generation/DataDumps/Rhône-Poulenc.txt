'''Rhône-Poulenc''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁon pulɛ̃k}}) was a French chemical and pharmaceutical company founded in 1928.  In 1999 it merged with [[Hoechst AG]] to form [[Aventis]].  As of 2015, the pharmaceutical operations of Rhône-Poulenc are part of [[Sanofi]] and the chemicals divisions are part of [[Solvay (company)|Solvay group]] and [[Bayer#Bayer CropScience|Bayer Crop Science]].

==History==
The company was founded in 1928 through the merger of '''Société des usines chimiques du Rhône''' (Society of Rhône Chemical Factories) from Lyon and [[Poulenc Frères]] (Poulenc Brothers) from Paris founded by Étienne Poulenc, a 19th-century Parisian apothecary and brought to prominence by his second and third sons Émile, father of composer [[Francis Poulenc]], and Camille Poulenc (1864–1942).  In 1950, the company synthesized [[chlorpromazine]] which it sold to Smith, Kline & French (today part of [[GlaxoSmithKline]]) who marketed the drug as Thorazine.<ref>{{cite book|author=Whitaker, Robert|title=Mad in America|publisher=Perseus (Basic Books)|year=2002|page=142|isbn=978-0-465-02014-0}}</ref> In 1990, it merged with the pharmaceutical company Rorer to form Rhône-Poulenc Rorer.<ref>[http://en.sanofi.com/history/ajax/en_rhone_poulenc.html Rhône Poulenc]</ref>  In January 1999, Rhône-Poulenc merged with [[Hoechst AG]] to form Aventis.  In 2004, Aventis went on to merge with Sanofi-Synthélabo forming Sanofi-Aventis, the third largest pharmaceutical company in the world.  In 2011, Sanofi-Aventis decided to drop the Aventis suffix and change its name to [[Sanofi]].

In 1997, its chemicals division was spun off into a separate company named [[Rhodia (company)|Rhodia]] and was later acquired by the [[Solvay (company)|Solvay]] group in 2011. The agricultural chemicals division of Rhône-Poulenc, known as Aventis CropScience after the merger with Hoechst, was sold to the German chemical and pharmaceutical company [[Bayer#Bayer CropScience|Bayer]] in 2002.

In 1997 Rhône-Poulenc came to play a central part in what is claimed to be the worst environmental accident in Sweden's history. Rhône-Poulenc supplied [[Rhoca-Gil]] for the building of the [[Hallandsås Tunnel|Hallandsås tunnel]]. The chemical leaked into the artesian water, causing great damage to cattle, surrounding nature and workers at the construction site.
Rhône-Poulenc was criticised for not pointing out the risks of using the sealant, which contained [[acrylamide]] and is considered to be carcinogenic. Criminal charges were brought against the company and In June 2001, the managing director of the former Rhône-Poulenc Sweden was found guilty of breaching the Chemical Products Act.{{citation needed | date=October 2014}}

Rhône-Poulenc originally funded the ''Rhône-Poulenc Prizes'', now known as the [[Royal Society Prizes for Science Books]].
