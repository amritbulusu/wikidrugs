'''Bronopol''' (INN) is an [[organic compound]] that is used as an [[antimicrobial]].  It is a white solid although commercial samples appear yellow.

The first cited synthesis of 2-Bromo-2-nitro-1,3-propanediol is 1897 according to Molbase.

Bronopol was invented by [[Boots Group|The Boots Company PLC]] in the early 1960s and first applications were as a [[preservative]] for [[pharmaceutical]]s. Owing to its low [[mammal]]ian [[toxicity]] (at in-use levels) and high activity against [[bacteria]] (especially the troublesome [[Gram-negative]] species),<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bryce|first1=D. M.|last2=Croshaw|first2=B.|last3=Hall|first3=J. E.|last4=Holland|first4=V. R.|last5=Lessel|first5=B.|title=The activity and safety of the antimicrobial agent bronopol (2-bromo-2-nitropropan-1, 3-diol)|journal=J. Soc. Cosmet. Chem.|date=1978|volume=29|pages=3–24|url=http://journal.scconline.org/pdf/cc1978/cc029n01/p00003-p00024.pdf|accessdate=5 April 2016}}</ref> bronopol became popular as a preservative in many consumer products such as [[shampoo]]s and [[cosmetics]].  It was subsequently adopted as an antimicrobial in other industrial environments such as [[paper mill]]s, [[oil exploration]] and production facilities, as well as cooling water disinfection plants.

==Production==
Bronopol is produced by the [[bromination]] of di(hydroxymethyl)nitromethane, which is derived from [[nitromethane]] by a [[nitroaldol reaction]].<ref>Sheldon B. Markofsky "Nitro Compounds, Aliphatic" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2012, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a17_401.pub2}}</ref>  World production increased from the tens of [[tonne]]s in the late 1970s to current estimates in excess of 5,000 tonnes. Manufacturing today is the business of low cost producers, mainly in [[China]].

==Applications==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
Bronopol is used in consumer products as an effective preservative agent, as well as a wide variety of industrial applications (almost any industrial water system is a potential environment for bacterial growth, leading to [[Biofilm|slime]] and [[corrosion]] problems - in many of these systems Bronopol can be a highly effective treatment).

The use of bronopol in [[personal care products]] ([[cosmetics]], [[toiletries]]) has declined since the late 1980s due to the potential formation of [[nitrosamine]]s. While Bronopol is not in itself a nitrosating agent, under conditions where it decomposes ''([[alkaline]] solution and/or elevated temperatures)'' it can liberate nitrite and low levels of formaldehyde and these decomposition products can react with any contaminant secondary amines or amides in a personal care formulation to produce significant levels of nitrosamines (due to the toxicity of these substances, the term 'significant' means levels as low as 10s of parts per billion).

Manufacturers of personal care products are therefore instructed by regulatory authorities to 'avoid the formation of nitrosamines' which might mean removing amines or amides from the formulation, removing Bronopol from a formulation, or using nitrosamine inhibitors.

Bronopol has been restricted for use in cosmetics in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|title=Consumer product safety: Cosmetic ingredient hotlist|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/cps-spc/cosmet-person/hot-list-critique/hotlist-liste-eng.php#b1|publisher=Health Canada|accessdate=2017-01-24}}</ref>

==Physical and chemical properties==

===Appearance===
Bronopol is supplied as [[crystal]]s or crystalline powder, which may vary from white to pale yellow in colour depending on the grade. The yellow colouration is due to chelation of iron during the manufacturing process.

===Melting point===
As a pure material, Bronopol has a [[melting point]] of about 130&nbsp;°C. However, due to its [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphic]] characteristics, Bronopol undergoes a [[crystal structure|lattice]] rearrangement at 100 to 105&nbsp;°C and this can often be wrongly interpreted as the melting point.

At temperatures above 140&nbsp;°C, bronopol decomposes [[exothermic]]ally releasing [[hydrogen bromide]] and oxides of [[nitrogen]].

===Solubility===
Bronopol is readily soluble in water; the dissolution process is [[endothermic]]. Solutions containing up to 28% w/v are possible at [[ambient temperature]].

Bronopol is poorly soluble in non-polar [[solvent]]s but shows a high affinity for polar organic solvents.

===Partition coefficient===
Study of the solubility data clearly shows that Bronopol has a high affinity for polar rather than non-polar environments. In two phase systems, Bronopol partitions preferentially into the polar (usually aqueous) phase.

===Stability in aqueous solution===
In aqueous solutions, bronopol is most stable when the [[pH]] of the system is on the [[acid]] side of neutral. Temperature also has a significant effect on stability in alkaline systems.

===Degradation===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
Under extreme alkaline conditions, bronopol decomposes in aqueous solution and very low levels of formaldehyde are produced.<ref>http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/725087_8</ref> Liberated formaldehyde is not responsible for the biological activity associated with bronopol.  Other decomposition products detected after bronopol breakdown are [[bromide ion]], [[nitrite ion]], bromonitroethanol and 2-hydroxymethyl-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol.
