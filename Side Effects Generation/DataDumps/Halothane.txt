It is a potent anesthetic with a [[minimum alveolar concentration|MAC]] of 0.74%. Its [[blood/gas partition coefficient]] of 2.4 makes it an agent with moderate induction and recovery time. It is not a good [[analgesic]] and its muscle relaxation effect is moderate.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Halothane |url=http://anesthesiageneral.com/halothane/ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216054455/http://anesthesiageneral.com/halothane/ |archivedate=2011-02-16 |df= }}</ref>

==Side effects==
In rare cases, repeated exposure to halothane in adults was noted to result in severe [[liver]] injury. This occurred in about one in 10,000 exposures. The resulting syndrome was referred to as halothane [[hepatitis]], and is thought to result from the metabolism of halothane to [[trifluoroacetic acid]] via oxidative reactions in the liver. About 20% of inhaled halothane is metabolized by the liver and these products are excreted in the urine. The hepatitis syndrome had a mortality rate of 30% to 70%. Concern for hepatitis resulted in a dramatic reduction in the use of halothane for adults and it was replaced in the 1980s by [[enflurane]] and [[isoflurane]]. By 2005, the most common volatile anesthetics used were [[isoflurane]], [[sevoflurane]], and [[desflurane]]. Since the risk of halothane hepatitis in children was substantially lower than in adults, halothane continued to be used in pediatrics in the 1990s as it was especially useful for inhalation induction of anaesthesia  . However, by 2000, sevoflurane, excellent for inhalation induction, had largely replaced the use of halothane in children.

Halothane sensitises the heart to catecholamines, so it is liable to cause cardiac arrhythmias, occasionally fatal, particularly if [[hypercapnia]] has been allowed to develop.  This seems to be especially problematic in dental anaesthesia.

Like all the potent inhalational anaesthetic agents, it is a potent trigger for [[malignant hyperthermia]].  Similarly, in common with the other potent inhalational agents, it relaxes uterine smooth muscle and this may increase blood loss during delivery or termination of pregnancy.

=== Occupational safety ===
People can be exposed to halothane in the workplace by breathing it in as waste anaesthetic gas, skin contact, eye contact, or swallowing it. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 2 ppm (16.2&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup>) over 60 minutes.<ref>{{Cite web|title = CDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards - Halothane|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0310.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-03|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208104932/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0310.html|archivedate = 2015-12-08|df = }}</ref>

Chemically, halothane is an [[alkyl halide]] (not an [[ether]] like many other anesthetics).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01159#taxonomy |title=DrugBank: Halothane (DB01159) |date=17 December 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121230034/http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01159#taxonomy |archivedate=21 November 2011 |df= }}</ref> The structure has one stereocenter, so (''R'')- and (''S'')-[[optical isomer]]s occur.

==Synthesis==
The commercial synthesis of halothane starts from [[trichloroethylene]], which is reacted with [[hydrogen fluoride]] in the presence of [[antimony trichloride]] at 130&nbsp;°C to form 2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane. This is then reacted with [[bromine]] at 450&nbsp;°C to produce halothane.<ref>{{Ref patent3 | country = US | number = 2921098 | status = granted | title = PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF 1,1,1-TRIFLUORO-2-BROMO-2-CHLOROETHANE | pubdate = 1958-06-30 | gdate =  January 1960 | pridate= 1954-08-20 | inventor = Suckling et al. | assign1= Imperial Chemical Industries | google_patent_id = 6JpaAAAAEBAJ }}</ref>

==Related substances==
Attempts to find anesthetics with less metabolism led to [[halogenated ether]]s such as enflurane and isoflurane. The incidence of [[liver|hepatic]] reactions with these agents is lower. The exact degree of [[hepatotoxic]] potential of enflurane is debated, although it is minimally metabolized. Isoflurane is essentially not metabolized and reports of associated liver injury are quite rare. Small amounts of [[trifluoroacetic acid]] can be formed from both halothane and isoflurane metabolism and possibly accounts for cross sensitization of patients between these agents.

The main advantage of the more modern agents is lower blood solubility, resulting in faster induction of and recovery from anaesthesia.

==History==
Halothane was first synthesized by [[Charles Suckling|C. W. Suckling]] of [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] in 1951 in Widnes and was first used clinically by M. Johnstone in [[Manchester]] in 1956. It became popular as a nonflammable general anesthetic replacing other [[volatile anesthetic]]s such as [[trichloroethylene]], [[diethyl ether]] and [[cyclopropane]]. In many parts of the world it has been largely replaced by newer agents since the 1980s but is still widely used in developing countries and in [[veterinary medicine|veterinary]] [[surgery]] because of its lower cost.
[[File:Halothane meter.jpg|thumb|A meter for measuring halothane. This was used to measure the amount of halothane a flow of inspired gas during anesthesia.]]
Halothane was given to many millions of adult and pediatric patients worldwide from its introduction in 1956 through the 1980s.<ref name="NiedermeyerSilva2005">{{cite book|last1=Niedermeyer|first1=Ernst|last2=Silva|first2=F. H. Lopes da|title=Electroencephalography: Basic Principles, Clinical Applications, and Related Fields|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tndqYGPHQdEC&pg=PA1156|year=2005|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-5126-1|page=1156|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509001417/https://books.google.com/books?id=tndqYGPHQdEC&pg=PA1156|archivedate=2016-05-09|df=}}</ref> Its properties include cardiac depression at high levels, cardiac sensitization to [[catecholamine]]s such as [[norepinephrine]], and potent bronchial relaxation. Its lack of airway irritation made it a common inhalation induction agent in pediatric anesthesia. Due to its cardiac depressive effect, it was [[Contraindication|contraindicated]] in patients with cardiac failure. Halothane was also contraindicated in patients susceptible to [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s, or in situations related to high catecholamine levels such as [[pheochromocytoma]].

==Availability==
It is available as a volatile liquid, at 30, 50, 200, and 250 ml per container<ref>National formulary of India, 4th Ed. New Delhi, India,  Indian Pharmacopoeia commission; 2011: 411</ref> but in many developed nations is not available having been displaced by newer agents.

It is the only [[inhalational anesthetic]] containing [[bromine]], which makes it [[radiopaque]]. It is colorless and pleasant-smelling, but unstable in light. It is packaged in dark-colored bottles and contains 0.01% [[thymol]] as a stabilizing agent.
