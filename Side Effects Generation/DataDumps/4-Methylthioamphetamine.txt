'''4-Methylthioamphetamine''' ('''4-MTA''') is a [[designer drug]] developed in the 1990s by a team led by [[David E. Nichols]] at [[Purdue University]]. It acts as a non-[[neurotoxic]] highly [[selective serotonin releasing agent]] (SSRA) in animals.<ref name="pmid1473561">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0014-2999(92)90282-9 |vauthors=Huang X, Marona-Lewicka D, Nichols DE | title = p-methylthioamphetamine is a potent new non-neurotoxic serotonin-releasing agent. | journal = Eur J Pharmacol. | volume = 229 | issue = 1 | pages = 31–38 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1473561 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = Q | last2 = Murakami | first2 = I | last3 = Stall | first3 = S | last4 = Levy | first4 = AD | last5 = Brownfield | first5 = MS | last6 = Nichols | first6 = DE | last7 = Van De Kar | first7 = LD | title = Neuroendocrine pharmacology of three serotonin releasers: 1-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-2-(methylamino)butane (MBDB), 5-methoxy-6-methyl-2-aminoindan (MMAi) and p-methylthioamphetamine (MTA). | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 279 | issue = 3 | pages = 1261–7 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8968349 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Murphy | first1 = J | last2 = Flynn | first2 = JJ | last3 = Cannon | first3 = DM | last4 = Guiry | first4 = PJ | last5 = McCormack | first5 = P | last6 = Baird | first6 = AW | last7 = McBean | first7 = GJ | last8 = Keenan | first8 = AK | title = In vitro neuronal and vascular responses to 5-hydroxytryptamine: modulation by 4-methylthioamphetamine, 4-methylthiomethamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine. | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 444 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 61–7 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12191583 | doi=10.1016/S0014-2999(02)01586-8}}</ref> It is distantly related to several other SSRAs, including [[MMAI]], [[MDAI]], and [[MDMAI]].

4-MTA was briefly sold in [[smart shop]]s in the [[Netherlands]], though was soon banned by the Dutch government after serious side-effects started to emerge. It was also briefly sold on the black market as [[MDMA]] during the late 1990s, mainly in the USA, but proved unpopular due to its high risk of severe side effects (several deaths were reported) and relative lack of positive euphoria.
