'''Trefentanil''' (A-3665) is an [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] that is an [[analog (chemistry)|analogue]] of [[fentanyl]] and was developed in 1992.<ref>Cambareri JJ, Afifi MS, Glass PS, Esposito BF, Camporesi EM. A-3665, a new short-acting opioid: a comparison with alfentanil. Anesthesia and Analgesia. 1993 Apr;76(4):812-6.</ref>

Trefentanil is most similar to short-acting fentanyl analogues such as [[alfentanil]]. In comparative studies, trefentanil was slightly more potent and shorter acting than alfentanil as an analgesic,<ref>Lemmens HJ, Dyck JB, Shafer SL, Stanski DR. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling in drug development: application to the investigational opioid trefentanil. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics. 1994 Sep;56(3):261-71.</ref> but induced significantly more severe [[respiratory depression]].<ref>Cambareri JJ, Afifi MS, Glass PS, Esposito BF, Camporesi EM. A-3665, a new short-acting opioid: a comparison with alfentanil. Anesthesia and Analgesia. 1993 Apr;76(4):812-6.</ref> For this reason trefentanil has not been adopted for clinical use, although it is still used in research.

Trefentanil has very similar effects to alfentanil, much like those of fentanyl itself but more potent and shorter lasting. Side effects of [[fentanyl]] analogs are similar to those of fentanyl itself, which include [[itching]], [[nausea]] and potentially serious [[respiratory depression]], which can be life-threatening. Fentanyl analogs have killed hundreds of people throughout Europe and the former Soviet republics since the most recent resurgence in use began in Estonia in the early 2000s, and novel derivatives continue to appear.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.ijdp.org/article/S0955-3959%2815%2900097-3/abstract | title=Fentanyls: Are we missing the signs? Highly potent and on the rise in Europe. | author=Jane Mounteney | author2=Isabelle Giraudon | author3=Gleb Denissov | author4=Paul Griffiths | journal=The international journal of drug policy. | date=July 2015 | volume=26 | issue=7 | pages=626â€“631 | doi=10.1016/j.drugpo.2015.04.003 | pmid=25976511}}</ref> The risk of respiratory depression is especially high with potent fentanyl analogues such as alfentanil and trefentanil, and these drugs pose a significant risk of death if used outside of a hospital setting with appropriate artificial breathing apparatus available.
