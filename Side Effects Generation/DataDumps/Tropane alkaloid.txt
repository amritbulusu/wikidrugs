[[File:Tropane svg.svg|thumb|200px|The chemical structure of [[tropane]]]]

'''Tropane alkaloids''' are a class of bicyclic [3.2.1] [[alkaloid]]s and [[secondary metabolite]]s that contain a [[tropane]] ring in their [[chemical structure]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=O’Hagan|first1=David|title=Pyrrole, pyrrolidine, pyridine, piperidine and tropane alkaloids (1998 to 1999)|journal=Natural Product Reports|date=2000|volume=17|issue=5|pages=435–446|doi=10.1039/a707613d}}</ref> Tropane alkaloids occur naturally in many members of the plant family [[Solanaceae]].  Some tropane alkaloids have pharmacological properties and can act as [[anticholinergics]] or [[stimulants]].

== Anticholinergics ==
[[Anticholinergic drug]]s<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Grynkiewicz|first1=G|last2=Gadzikowska|first2=M|title=Tropane alkaloids as medicinally useful natural products and their synthetic derivatives as new drugs.|journal=Pharmacological reports : PR|date=|volume=60|issue=4|pages=439-63|pmid=18799813}}</ref> and [[deliriant]]s:

* [[Atropine]], [[racemate|racemic]] hyoscyamine, from the deadly nightshade (''[[Atropa belladonna]]'')
* [[Hyoscyamine]], the ''levo''-[[isomer]] of atropine, from henbane (''[[Hyoscyamus niger]]'') and mandrake (''[[Mandragora officinarum]]'')
* [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|Scopolamine]], from henbane and ''[[Datura]]'' species (Jimson weed)

All three [[acetylcholine]]-inhibiting chemicals can also be found in the leaves, stems, and flowers in varying, unknown amounts in ''[[Brugmansia]]'' (angel trumpets), a relative of ''[[Datura]]''.  The same is true of most plants found within the [[Solanaceae]], particularly concentrated in leaves and seeds. However, the concentration of alkaloids can vary so greatly, even from leaf to leaf and seed to seed.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

== Stimulants ==
[[Stimulant]]s and cocaine-related alkaloids:

* [[Cocaine]], from ''[[Erythroxylum coca]]''
* [[Ecgonine]], a precursor and metabolite of cocaine
* [[Benzoylecgonine]], a metabolite of cocaine
* [[Hydroxytropacocaine]], from ''Erythroxylum coca''
* [[Methylecgonine cinnamate]], from ''Erythroxylum coca''

== Others ==
* [[Catuabine]]s, found in [[catuaba]], an infusion or dry extract made from ''[[Erythroxylum vaccinifolium]]''
* [[Scopine]]

== Non-natural tropanes ==
There exist some synthetic analogs of tropane alkaloids, see
* [[Phenyltropane]]s
They are not considered to be alkaloids per definition.
