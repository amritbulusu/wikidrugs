'''Penbutolol''' (brand names '''Levatol''', '''Levatolol''', '''Lobeta''', '''Paginol''', '''Hostabloc''', '''Betapressin''') is a [[medication]] in the class of [[beta blocker]]s, used in the treatment of [[hypertension|high blood pressure]].<ref name=label>FDA [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2011/018976s012lbl.pdf Penbutolol label] Last updated Dec 2010</ref> Penbutolol is able to bind to both [[Beta-1 adrenergic receptor|beta-1 adrenergic receptors]] and [[beta-2 adrenergic receptors]] (the two subtypes), thus making it a non-selective β blocker.<ref name=Katzung>Katzung, Bertram G.

==Medical uses==
Penbutolol is used to treat mild to moderate [[hypertension|high blood pressure]].<ref name=label/>  Like other [[beta blockers]] it is not a first line treatment for this indication.<ref>NICE [https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg127/chapter/1-guidance Hypertension guidance] Last updated 2013</ref>

It should not be used or only used with caution in people with [[heart failure]] and people with asthma. It may mask signs of low blood sugar in people with diabetes and it may mask signs of hyperthyroidism.<ref name=label/> 

Animal studies showed some signs of potential trouble for women who are pregnant, and it has not been tested in women who are pregnant.  It is not known if penbutolol is secreted in breast milk.<ref name=label/>

==Side effects==
Penbutolol has a low frequency of side effects.<ref name=label/><ref name=Schoenberger>Schoenberger, J. A. Usefulness of penbutolol for systemic hypertension. Penbutolol Research Group. Am J Cardiol. 1989 Jun 1;63(18):1339-42. {{PMID|2658525}}</ref> These side effects include dizziness, light headedness, and nausea.<ref name=label/><ref name=Vallner/> 

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Penbutolol is able to bind to both beta-1 adrenergic receptors and [[beta-2 adrenergic receptors]] (the two subtypes), thus making it a non-selective β blocker.<ref name=Katzung/>{{rp|Table 10-2, p 252}} Penbutolol is a [[sympathomimetic drug]] with properties allowing it to act as a partial agonist at β adrenergic receptors.<ref name=Frishman/> 

Blocking β adrenergic receptors decreases the heart rate and [[cardiac output]] to lower [[arterial blood pressure]]. β blockers also decrease [[renin]] levels, which ultimately results in less water being reabsorbed by the kidneys and therefore a lower [[blood volume]] and [[blood pressure]].<ref name=Berdeaux>Berdeaux, A., Duhaze, P., Giudicelli, J. F. (1982). Pharmacological analysis of beta adrenoceptor blockade-induced coronary blood flow redistribution in dogs using l-penbutolol. The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 221(3):740-747 {{PMID|6123586}}</ref>

Penbutolol acts on the β1 adrenergic receptors in both the heart and the kidney. When β1 receptors are activated by a [[catecholamine]], they stimulate a coupled [[G protein]] which activates adenylyl to convert [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) to [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate]] (cAMP). The increase in cAMP ultimately alters the movement of calcium ions in heart muscle and increases heart rate.<ref name=Katzung/>{{rp|213-214}}  Penbutolol blocks this and decreases heart rate, which lowers blood pressure.<ref>Dent, M. R., Singal, T., Tappia, P. S., Sethi, R., Dhall, N. S. (2008). β-Adrenoceptor-Linked Signal Transduction Mechanisms in Congestive Heart Failure.  Chapter 2, pp 27-49 in Signal transduction in the cardiovascular system in health and disease, Eds Srivastava, Ashok K., Anand-Srivastava, Madhu B.  Springer Science & Business Media, 2008 {{ISBN|9780387095523}}</ref>{{rp|40}} 

The ability of penbutolol to act as a [[partial agonist]] proves useful in the prevention of [[bradycardia]] as a result of decreasing the heart rate excessively.<ref name=Frishman/>  Penbutolol binding β1 adrenergic receptors also alters kidney functions. Under normal physiological conditions, the enzyme renin converts [[angiotensinogen]] to [[angiotensin I]], which will then be converted to [[angiotensin II]]. Angiotensin II stimulates the release of [[aldosterone]] from the [[adrenal gland]], causing a decrease in [[electrolyte]] and water retention, ultimately increasing water excretion and decreasing blood volume and pressure.<ref name=Harvey>Finkel, Richard; Clark, Michelle A.; Cubeddu, Luigi X. Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews: Pharmacology, 4th Edition  Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2009. {{ISBN|9780781771559}}</ref>{{rp|221}}

Like [[propanolol]] and [[pindolol]], it is a [[serotonin]] [[5-HT1A receptor|5-HT<sub>1A</sub>]] and [[5-HT1B receptor|5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptor]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]];<ref name="pmid8093601">{{cite journal | vauthors = Langlois M, Brémont B, Rousselle D, Gaudy F | title = Structural analysis by the comparative molecular field analysis method of the affinity of beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agents for 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors | journal = Eur.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Penbutolol is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, has a [[bioavailability]] over 90%,<ref name=Vallner>Vallner, J. J. et al. (1977). Plasma level studies of penbutolol after oral dose in man. Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, 17(4):231-23 {{PMID|14976}}</ref> and has a rapid onset of effect. Penbutolol has a [[half life]] of five hours.<ref name=Katzung/>{{rp|Table 10-2, p 252}} 

==Society and culture==

===Availability===
Penbutolol was approved by the FDA in 1987.<ref name=FDAapp/>  In January 2015 the FDA acknowledged that the penbutolol was no longer marketed in the US, and determined that the drug was not withdrawn for safety reasons.<ref name=FDAstop/>
