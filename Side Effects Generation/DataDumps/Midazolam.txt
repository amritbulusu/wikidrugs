==Medical uses==

===Seizures===
Midazolam is sometimes used for the acute management of [[seizure]]s. Long-term use for the management of epilepsy is not recommended due to the significant risk of tolerance (which renders midazolam and other benzodiazepines ineffective) and the significant side effect of sedation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Isojärvi JI, Tokola RA | title = Benzodiazepines in the treatment of epilepsy in people with intellectual disability | journal = Journal of Intellectual Disability Research | volume = 42 Suppl 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 80–92 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 10030438 }}</ref> A benefit of midazolam is that in children it can be administered buccally or intranasally at home or at school for emergency control of acute seizures, including status epilepticus.<ref name="Appleton-2008">{{cite journal | vauthors = Appleton R, Macleod S, Martland T | title = Drug management for acute tonic-clonic convulsions including convulsive status epilepticus in children | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 3 | pages = CD001905 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18646081 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001905.pub2 | url = http://mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD001905/pdf_fs.html | format = PDF | editor1-last = Appleton | editor1-first = Richard }}</ref><ref name="Walker-2005">{{cite journal | vauthors = Walker M | title = Status epilepticus: an evidence based guide | journal = BMJ | volume = 331 | issue = 7518 | pages = 673–7 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16179702 | pmc = 1226249 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.331.7518.673 }}</ref> Midazolam is effective for [[status epilepticus]] that has not improved following other treatments or when intravenous access cannot be obtained, and has advantages of being water-soluble, having a rapid onset of action and not causing [[metabolic acidosis]] from the [[propylene glycol]] vehicle, which occurs with other benzodiazepines. Drawbacks include a high degree of breakthrough seizures—due to the short half-life of midazolam—in over 50% of people treated, as well as treatment failure in 14–18% of people with refractory status epilepticus. Tolerance develops rapidly to the anticonvulsant effect, and the dose may need to be increased by several times to maintain anticonvulsant therapeutic effects. With prolonged use, tolerance and [[tachyphylaxis]] can occur and the elimination half-life may increase, up to days.<ref name="Riss-2008"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Murthy JM | title = Refractory status epilepticus | journal = Neurology India | volume = 54 | issue = 4 | pages = 354–8 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17114841 | doi = 10.4103/0028-3886.28104 }}</ref> There is evidence [[Cheek|buccal]] and [[intranasal]] midazolam is easier to administer and more effective than rectally administered diazepam in the emergency control of seizures.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Eriksson K, Kälviäinen R | title = Pharmacologic management of convulsive status epilepticus in childhood | journal = Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 777–83 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16274335 | doi = 10.1586/14737175.5.6.777 }}</ref><ref name="Wolfe-2006">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolfe TR, Macfarlane TC | title = Intranasal midazolam therapy for pediatric status epilepticus | journal = The American Journal of Emergency Medicine | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 343–6 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16635708 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajem.2005.11.004 }}</ref><ref name="Sofou-2009">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sofou K, Kristjánsdóttir R, Papachatzakis NE, Ahmadzadeh A, Uvebrant P | title = Management of prolonged seizures and status epilepticus in childhood: a systematic review | journal = Journal of Child Neurology | volume = 24 | issue = 8 | pages = 918–26 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19332572 | doi = 10.1177/0883073809332768 }}</ref>

===Procedural sedation===
Intravenous midazolam is indicated for procedural sedation (often in combination with an [[opioid]], such as [[fentanyl]]), for preoperative sedation, for the induction of [[general anesthesia]], and for sedation of people who are [[medical ventilator|ventilated]] in [[intensive-care medicine|critical care]] units.<ref name="Brown-2005">{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown TB, Lovato LM, Parker D | title = Procedural sedation in the acute care setting | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 71 | issue = 1 | pages = 85–90 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15663030 }}</ref><ref name="O'Connor-2009">{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Connor M, Bucknall T, Manias E | title = Sedation management in Australian and New Zealand intensive care units: doctors' and nurses' practices and opinions | journal = American Journal of Critical Care | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 285–95 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 19770414 | doi = 10.4037/ajcc2009541 }}</ref> Midazolam is superior to [[diazepam]] in impairing memory of endoscopy procedures, but [[propofol]] has a quicker recovery time and a better memory-impairing effect.<ref name="McQuaid-2008">{{cite journal | vauthors = McQuaid KR, Laine L | title = A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials of moderate sedation for routine endoscopic procedures | journal = Gastrointestinal Endoscopy | volume = 67 | issue = 6 | pages = 910–23 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18440381 | doi = 10.1016/j.gie.2007.12.046 }}</ref> It is the most popular benzodiazepine in the intensive care unit (ICU) because of its short [[Biological half-life|elimination half-life]], combined with its water solubility and its suitability for continuous infusion.

Midazolam is sometimes used in neonatal intensive care units. When used, additional caution is required in [[neonates|newborns]]; midazolam should not be used for longer than 72 hours due to risks of [[tachyphylaxis]], and the possibility of development of a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, as well as neurological complications. [[Bolus (medicine)|Bolus]] injections should be avoided due to the increased risk of cardiovascular depression, as well as neurological complications.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rawicz M | title = [Recommendations for analgesia and sedation in neonatal intensive care] | journal = Medycyna Wieku Rozwojowego | volume = 12 | issue = 4 Pt 1 | pages = 958–67 | date = Oct–Dec 2008 | pmid = 19471072 }}</ref>
Midazolam is also sometimes used in newborns who are receiving [[mechanical ventilation]], although [[morphine]] is preferred, owing to its better safety profile for this indication.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bellù R, de Waal KA, Zanini R | title = Opioids for neonates receiving mechanical ventilation | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 1 | pages = CD004212 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18254040 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004212.pub3 | editor1-last = Bellù | editor1-first = Roberto | name-list-format = vanc }}</ref>

===Problems sleeping===
Oral midazolam is indicated for the short-term treatment of moderately severe insomnia in people who have not reacted adequately to other hypnotics, and who have persistent trouble in falling asleep. Because of midazolam's extremely short duration, it is not used for people who have trouble staying asleep through the night; moderate- to long-acting benzodiazepines, such as [[temazepam]], [[nitrazepam]], [[flunitrazepam]], and [[lormetazepam]], are used for those purposes. Midazolam and other benzodiazepines may cause a deterioration in sleep quality.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Agitation===
Midazolam, in combination with an antipsychotic drug, is indicated for the acute management of [[schizophrenia]] when it is associated with aggressive or out-of-control behaviour.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Huf|first1=G|last2=Alexander|first2=J|last3=Gandhi|first3=P|last4=Allen|first4=MH|title=Haloperidol plus promethazine for psychosis-induced aggression.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=25 November 2016|volume=11|pages=CD005146|pmid=27885664}}</ref>

===End of life care===
In the final stages of [[end-of-life care]], midazolam is routinely used at low doses via subcutaneous injection to help with agitation, [[myoclonus]], restlessness or anxiety in the last hours or days of life.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mcpcil.org.uk/liverpool-care-pathway/pdfs/LCP%20HOSPITAL%20VERSION%2011%20%28printable%20version%29.pdf |title=Care of the Dying Pathway (lcp) (Hospital) |author=Liverpool Care Pathway |date=January 2005 |location=United Kingdom |format=PDF |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008072445/http://www.mcpcil.org.uk/liverpool-care-pathway/pdfs/LCP%20HOSPITAL%20VERSION%2011%20%28printable%20version%29.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-08 |df= }}</ref> At higher doses during the last weeks of life, midazolam is considered a [[first line agent]] in palliative [[continuous deep sedation therapy]] when it is necessary to alleviate intolerable suffering not responsive to other treatments,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = de Graeff A, Dean M | title = Palliative sedation therapy in the last weeks of life: a literature review and recommendations for standards | journal = Journal of Palliative Medicine | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 67–85 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17298256 | doi = 10.1089/jpm.2006.0139 }}</ref> but the need for this is rare.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/media/press-releases/Pages/National-care-of-the-dying-audit-2009.aspx|title=National care of the dying audit 2009|author=[[Royal College of Physicians]]|date=September 2009|location=United Kingdom|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120111123/http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/media/Press-releases/Pages/National-care-of-the-dying-audit-2009.aspx|archivedate=2010-01-20|df=}} "[I]n their last 24 hours... 31% had low doses of medication to [control distress from agitation or restlessness]... the remaining 4% required higher doses"</ref>

Side effects of midazolam in the elderly are listed above.<ref name="Riss-2008"/> People experiencing [[Anterograde amnesia|amnesia]] as a side effect of midazolam are generally unaware their memory is impaired, unless they had previously known it as a side effect.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Merritt P, Hirshman E, Hsu J, Berrigan M |title=Metamemory without the memory: are people aware of midazolam-induced amnesia? |journal=Psychopharmacology |volume=177 |issue=3 |pages=336–43 |date=January 2005 |pmid=15290003 |doi=10.1007/s00213-004-1958-8}}</ref>

Long-term use of benzodiazepines has been associated with long-lasting deficits of memory, and show only partial recovery six months after stopping benzodiazepines.<ref name="Riss-2008" /> It is unclear whether full recovery occurs after longer periods of abstinence. Benzodiazepines can cause or worsen depression.<ref name="Riss-2008" /> Paradoxical excitement occasionally occurs with benzodiazepines, including a worsening of seizures. Children and elderly individuals or those with a history of alcohol abuse and individuals with a history of aggressive behavior or anger are at increased risk of paradoxical effects.<ref name="Riss-2008" /> [[Paradoxical reaction]]s are particularly associated with intravenous administration.<ref name="Rosenbaum-2009"/> After nighttime administration of midazolam, residual 'hangover' effects, such as sleepiness and impaired psychomotor and [[cognitive]] functions, may persist into the next day.

A "midazolam infusion syndrome" may result from high doses, and is characterised by delayed arousal hours to days after discontinuation of midazolam, and may lead to an increase in the length of ventilatory support needed.<ref name="Mencía-2007" />

In susceptible individuals, midazolam has been known to cause a paradoxical reaction, a well-documented complication with benzodiazepines. When this occurs, the individual may experience anxiety, involuntary movements, aggressive or violent behavior, uncontrollable crying or verbalization, and other similar effects. This seems to be related to the altered state of consciousness or [[disinhibition]] produced by the drug. Paradoxical behavior is often not recalled by the patient due to the amnesia-producing properties of the drug.

===Pregnancy and breastfeeding===
Midazolam, when taken during the [[third trimester]] of pregnancy, may cause risk to the neonate, including benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, with possible symptoms including [[hypotonia]], [[apnoeic]] spells, [[cyanosis]], and impaired [[metabolic]] responses to cold stress. Symptoms of hypotonia and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome have been reported to persist from hours to months after birth.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=McElhatton PR |title=The effects of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy and lactation |journal=Reproductive Toxicology |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=461–75 |date=Nov–Dec 1994 |pmid=7881198 |doi=10.1016/0890-6238(94)90029-9}}</ref> Other [[neonatal withdrawal]] symptoms include hyperexcitability, tremor, and gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea or vomiting).

===Elderly===
Additional caution is required in the elderly, as they are more sensitive to the pharmacological effects of benzodiazepines, metabolise them more slowly, and are more prone to adverse effects, including drowsiness, amnesia (especially [[anterograde amnesia]]), ataxia, hangover effects, confusion, and falls.<ref name="Riss-2008"/>

===Tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal===
A benzodiazepine dependence occurs in about one-third of individuals who are treated with benzodiazepines for longer than 4 weeks,<ref name="Riss-2008"/> which typically results in tolerance and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome when the dose is reduced too rapidly. Midazolam infusions may induce tolerance and a withdrawal syndrome in a matter of days. The risk factors for dependence include dependent personality, use of a benzodiazepine that is short-acting, high potency and long-term use of benzodiazepines. Withdrawal symptoms from midazolam can range from insomnia and anxiety to seizures and psychosis. Withdrawal symptoms can sometimes resemble a person’s underlying condition. Gradual reduction of midazolam after regular use can minimise withdrawal and [[rebound effects]]. Tolerance and the resultant withdrawal syndrome may be due to receptor down-regulation and [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor]] alterations in gene expression, which causes long-term changes in the function of the GABAergic neuronal system.<ref name="Riss-2008"/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fukuda K, Shoda T, Mima H, Uga H |title=Midazolam induces expression of c-Fos and EGR-1 by a non-GABAergic mechanism |journal=Anesthesia and Analgesia |volume=95 |issue=2 |pages=373–8, table of contents |date=August 2002 |pmid=12145054 |doi=10.1097/00000539-200208000-00024 |url=http://www.anesthesia-analgesia.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12145054 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cho HH, O'Connell JP, Cooney MF, Inchiosa MA |title=Minimizing tolerance and withdrawal to prolonged pediatric sedation: case report and review of the literature |journal=Journal of Intensive Care Medicine |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=173–179 |year=2007 |pmid=17569173 |doi=10.1177/0885066607299556 |url=http://jic.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17569173}}</ref>

Therefore, preventing a withdrawal syndrome requires that a prolonged infusion be gradually withdrawn, and sometimes, continued tapering of dose with an oral long-acting benzodiazepine such as [[clorazepate dipotassium]]. When signs of tolerance to midazolam occur during intensive care unit sedation the addition of an opioid or propofol is recommended. Withdrawal symptoms can include [[irritability]], abnormal [[reflexes]], [[tremor]]s, [[clonus]], [[hypertonicity]], [[delirium]] and [[seizures]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]], [[tachycardia]], [[hypertension]], and [[tachypnea]].<ref name="Mencía-2007">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mencía SB, López-Herce JC, Freddi N |title=Analgesia and sedation in children: practical approach for the most frequent situations |journal=Jornal de Pediatria |volume=83 |issue=2 Suppl |pages=S71-82 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17530139 |doi=10.2223/JPED.1625 |url=http://www.jped.com.br/conteudo/07-83-S71/ing.asp?cod=1625 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004181028/http://www.jped.com.br/conteudo/07-83-S71/ing.asp?cod=1625 |archivedate=2011-10-04 |df= }}</ref> In those with significant dependence, sudden discontinuation may result in withdrawal symptoms such as [[status epilepticus]] that may be fatal.

===Overdose===
{{See also|Benzodiazepine overdose}}
A midazolam overdose is considered a medical emergency and generally requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. Benzodiazepine overdose in healthy individuals is rarely life-threatening with proper medical support; however, the toxicity of benzodiazepines increases when they are combined with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, or tricyclic antidepressants. The toxicity of benzodiazepine overdose and risk of death is also increased in the elderly and those with [[obstructive pulmonary disease]] or when used intravenously. Treatment is supportive; activated charcoal can be used within an hour of the overdose. The [[antidote]] for an overdose of midazolam (or any other benzodiazepine) is [[flumazenil]].<ref name="Olkkola-2008" /> While effective in reversing the effects of benzodiazepines it is not used in most cases as it may trigger seizures in mixed overdoses and benzodiazepine dependent individuals.<ref name="davidsons_principles_and_practice_of_medicine_a15">{{Cite book |last1=A.

===Detection in body fluids===
Concentrations of midazolam or its major metabolite, 1-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide, may be measured in plasma, serum, or whole blood to monitor for safety in those receiving the drug therapeutically, to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients, or to assist in a forensic investigation of a case of fatal overdosage. Patients with renal dysfunction may exhibit prolongation of elimination half-life for both the parent drug and its active metabolite, with accumulation of these two substances in the bloodstream and the appearance of adverse depressant effects.<ref name="Baselt2008">{{cite book |last1=Baselt |first1=Randall C |name-list-format=vanc  |title=Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man |publisher=Biomedical Publications |location=Foster City CA |year=2008 |edition=8th |pages=1037–40 |isbn=978-0-9626523-7-0}}</ref>

===Marketing authorization===
In 2011, the [[European Medicines Agency]] granted a marketing authorisation for a buccal application form of midazolam, sold under the trade name Buccolam. Buccolam was approved for the treatment of prolonged, acute, convulsive seizures in people from three months to less than 18 years of age. This was the first application of a [[paediatric-use marketing authorisation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Committee_meeting_report/2011/07/WC500108232.pdf|title=Monthly Report|publisher=[[Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use]] (CHMP)|page=1|date=5 July 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123141032/http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Committee_meeting_report/2011/07/WC500108232.pdf|archivedate=23 January 2012|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wallstreet-online.de/nachricht/3364595-viropharma-s-buccolam-midazolam-oromucosal-solution-granted-european-marketing-authorization-for-treatment-of-acute-seizures|title=ViroPharma's Buccolam (Midazolam, Oromucosal Solution) Granted European Marketing Authorization for Treatment of Acute Seizures|author=PR Newswire|date=6 September 2011}}</ref>

=== Use in executions ===

The drug has been introduced for use in executions by [[lethal injection]] in certain jurisdictions in the [[Capital punishment in the United States|United States]] in combination with other drugs. It was introduced to replace [[pentobarbital]] after the latter's manufacturer disallowed that drug's use for executions.<ref name=spiegel>{{cite news | url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/todesstrafe-qualvolle-hinrichtung-loest-streit-ueber-todesstrafe-aus-a-1125340.html | author=Stefan Schulz | title=Die fahrlässige Hinrichtung des Ronald Smith | publisher=[[der Spiegel]] | language=German | date=December 10, 2016 | accessdate=December 10, 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161210184033/http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/todesstrafe-qualvolle-hinrichtung-loest-streit-ueber-todesstrafe-aus-a-1125340.html | archivedate=December 10, 2016 | df= }}</ref>

Midazolam acts as a sedative to render the condemned prisoner unconscious, at which time the vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride are administered, stopping the prisoner's breathing and heart, respectively. Florida used midazolam to execute William Happ in October 2013.<ref>{{cite news | title = Happ executed using new drug | url = http://www.gainesville.com/article/20131015/ARTICLES/131019753 | work = The Gainesville Sun | date = 2013-10-15 | author = Watkins M | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131212145118/http://www.gainesville.com/article/20131015/ARTICLES/131019753 | archivedate = 2013-12-12 | df =  }}</ref> The usage of midazolam in executions has become controversial after condemned inmate [[Execution of Clayton Lockett|Clayton Lockett]] apparently regained consciousness and started speaking midway through his execution when the state of [[Oklahoma]] attempted to execute him with an untested three-drug [[lethal injection]] cocktail using 100&nbsp;mg of midazolam. Prison officials reportedly discussed taking him to a hospital before he was pronounced dead of a heart attack 40 minutes after the execution began. An observing doctor stated that Lockett's vein had ruptured. It is not clear which drug or drugs caused his death or what quantities of vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride were released before the execution was cancelled.<ref name="url_ NYTimes.com">{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/30/us/oklahoma-executions.html | title = One Execution Botched, Oklahoma Delays the Next - NYTimes.com | author = Ekholm E | work = The New York Times | date = 2014-04-29 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170313154447/https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/30/us/oklahoma-executions.html | archivedate = 2017-03-13 | df =  }}</ref><ref name="url_Guardian">{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/30/oklahoma-execution-botched-clayton-lockett | title = Oklahoma execution: Clayton Lockett writhes on gurney in botched procedure | work = The Guardian | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140430024414/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/30/oklahoma-execution-botched-clayton-lockett | archivedate = 2014-04-30 | df =  }}</ref>

In ''[[Glossip v. Gross]]'', attorneys for three Oklahoma inmates argued that midazolam could not achieve the level of unconsciousness required for surgery, meaning severe pain and suffering was likely. They argued that midazolam was [[cruel and unusual punishment]] and thus contrary to the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].  In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled they failed to prove that midazolam was cruel and unusual when compared to known alternatives.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-33314067 | title= US Supreme Court backs use of contentious execution drug | date= 29 June 2015 | publisher= [[BBC News]] | accessdate= 2015-06-29 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150701191846/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-33314067 | archivedate= 1 July 2015 | df=  }}</ref>

On April 24, 2017, Arkansas carried out a double-execution of Jack Jones, 52, and Marcel Williams, 46. The state of Arkansas attempted to execute eight people before its supply of midazolam expired on April 30, 2017. Two of them were granted a stay of execution, and another, [[Ledell Lee|Ledell T.
