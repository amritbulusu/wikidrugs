==Mechanism of action==
Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused when a [[mutation]] in the DMD [[gene]] changes the DMD [[ribonucleic acid|RNA]] so that it no longer codes for functional [[dystrophin]] [[protein]], usually due to a mutation that alters the [[reading frame]] of the RNA [[Upstream and downstream (DNA)|downstream]] of the mutation. If an [[exon]] with an appropriate number of [[nucleobase|bases]] lies near the mutation, by removing that exon the downstream reading frame can be corrected and production of partially functional dystrophin can be restored.  This is the general strategy used for designing [[exon-skipping]] [[oligonucleotide|oligo]]s for DMD; as there are 79 exons in the longest [[Alternative splicing|splice form]] of the dystrophin transcript, many different oligos are needed to address the range of mutations present in the population of people with DMD.

Eteplirsen is a [[morpholino]] [[antisense]] oligomer which triggers excision of exon 51 during pre-mRNA splicing of the dystrophin RNA transcript.  Skipping exon 51 changes the downstream reading frame of dystrophin;<ref>{{cite journal | authorlink = | title = Exon Skipping Quantification by qRT-PCR in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Patients Treated with the Antisense Oligomer Eteplirsen | journal = Hum Gene Ther Methods.  | date = 17 Oct 2012 | doi = 10.1089/hgtb.2012.117 | last1 = Anthony | first1 = Karen | last2 = Feng | first2 = Lucy | last3 = Arechavala-Gomeza | first3 = Virginia | last4 = Guglieri | first4 = Michela | last5 = Straub | first5 = Volker | last6 = Bushby | first6 = Katherine | last7 = Cirak | first7 = Sebahattin | last8 = Morgan | first8 = Jennifer | last9 = Muntoni | first9 = Francesco | volume = 23 | issue = 5 | pages = 336–45 | pmid = 23075107  }}</ref> giving eteplirsen to a healthy person would result in production of dystrophin mRNA which would not code for functional dystrophin protein but, for DMD patients with particular frameshifting mutations, giving eteplirsen can restore the reading frame of the dystrophin mRNA and result in production of functional (although modified by having an internal deletion consisting of both the patient's original defect, as well as the therapeutically skipped exon) dystrophin.<ref>{{cite journal | authorlink = | title = Morpholinos and Their Peptide Conjugates: Therapeutic Promise and Challenge for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy | journal = Biochim Biophys Acta | volume = 1798 | issue = 12 | pages = 2296–303. | date = 17 Feb 2010 | pmid = 20170628 | last1 = Moulton | first1 = HM | last2 = Moulton | first2 = JD | doi = 10.1016/j.bbamem.2010.02.012 }}</ref>  Eteplirsen is given by intravenous infusion for systemic treatment of DMD.

Exon skipping is induced by eteplirsen, a charge-neutral, phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) that selectively binds to exon 51 of dystrophin pre-mRNA, restoring the phase of the reading frame and enabling production of functional, but truncated, dystrophin.<ref name=AdvisoryCommittee>http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/PeripheralandCentralNervousSystemDrugsAdvisoryCommittee/UCM497063.pdf</ref> The uncharged nature of the PMO helps make it resistant to biological degradation.<ref>http://www.discoverymedicine.com/Ryszard-Kole/2012/07/26/targeting-mrna-splicing-as-a-potential-treatment-for-duchenne-muscular-dystrophy</ref> This truncated dystrophin protein produced by eteplirsen causes a less severe form of dystrophinopathy, much like Becker muscular dystrophy. PMO technology to treat other genotypes amenable to exon skipping could potentially treat an estimated 70 to 80% of all DMD patients with dystrophin gene deletion. Eteplirsen's proposed mechanism of action is to bind to pre-mRNA needed to make a particular muscle protein, dystrophin, and rearrange the splicing of the RNA so that more dystrophin is made. By increasing the quantity of an abnormal, but potentially functional, dystrophin protein, the objective is to slow or prevent the progression of DMD.<ref name=AdvisoryCommittee /><ref name=AnnNeurol>{{cite journal | authorlink = | title = Eteplirsen for the treatment of duchenne muscular dystrophy | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262044004_Eteplirsen_for_the_treatment_of_duchenne_muscular_dystrophy_Ann_Neurol | journal = Ann.

Several clinical trials have been conducted to test eteplirsen, one in the UK involving local injection to the foot,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00159250 |title=Safety and Efficacy Study of Antisense Oligonucleotides in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy |author=Gary Roper, Manager Clinical Research Governance Organisation, Imperial College London |work=ClinicalTrials.gov |publisher=US Government, NIH |accessdate=30 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | authorlink = | title = Local restoration of dystrophin expression with the morpholino oligomer AVI-4658 in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: A single-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation, proof-of-concept study| journal = Lancet Neurol.| volume = 8 | issue = 10 | pages = 918–28 | date = 25 Aug 2009 | doi = 10.1016/S1474-4422(09)70211-X | pmid = 19713152 | last1 = Kinali | first1 = M | last2 = Arechavala-Gomeza | first2 = V | last3 = Feng | first3 = L | last4 = Cirak | first4 = S | last5 = Hunt | first5 = D | last6 = Adkin | first6 = C | last7 = Guglieri | first7 = M | last8 = Ashton | first8 = E | last9 = Abbs | first9 = S | last10 = Nihoyannopoulos | first10 = P | last11 = Garralda | first11 = ME | last12 = Rutherford | first12 = M | last13 = McCulley | first13 = C | last14 = Popplewell | first14 = L | last15 = Graham | first15 = IR | last16 = Dickson | first16 = G | last17 = Wood | first17 = MJ | last18 = Wells | first18 = DJ | last19 = Wilton | first19 = SD | last20 = Kole | first20 = R | last21 = Straub | first21 = V | last22 = Bushby | first22 = K | last23 = Sewry | first23 = C | last24 = Morgan | first24 = JE | last25 = Muntoni | first25 = F | pmc = 2755039 }}</ref> one in the UK involving systemic injection at low doses<ref name=Cirak2011 /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00844597 |title=Dose-Ranging Study of AVI-4658 to Induce Dystrophin Expression in Selected Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) Patients |author=Professor Francesco Muntoni, University College of London Institute of Child Health |work=ClinicalTrials.gov |publisher=US Government, NIH |accessdate=30 October 2012}}</ref> and one in the USA at higher systemic doses<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01396239 |title=Efficacy Study of AVI-4658 to Induce Dystrophin Expression in Selected Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Patients |author=Sarepta Therapeutics |work=ClinicalTrials.gov |publisher=US Government, NIH |accessdate=30 October 2012}}</ref> that progressed to a rollover extension study.<ref name=AnnNeurol /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01540409 |title=Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability Rollover Study of Eteplirsen in Subjects With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy |author=Sarepta Therapeutics |work=ClinicalTrials.gov |publisher=US Government, NIH |accessdate=30 October 2012}}</ref>
In the phase II study of 12 boys, dystrophin production was increased in 72% of the participants. It is questioned whether increasing the dose — which is feasible due to the lower toxicity of eteplirsen compared to [[drisapersen]] — would benefit the non-responders and whether this could result in any increased side effects.  A phase III study has begun in the USA.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT02255552 |title=Confirmatory Study of Eteplirsen in DMD Patients (PROMOVI) |author=Sarepta Therapeutics |work=ClinicalTrials.gov |publisher=US Government, NIH |accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>

In 2011, in a UK study eteplirsen (''AVI-4658'') was given to 19 children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy; researchers found that higher doses of the drug led to an increase in dystrophin.
Researchers believe that drugs which are designed to make the body “skip over” mutations in this way could be used to treat approximately 83% of Duchenne muscular dystrophy cases. Eteplirsen only targets mutations in a region implicated in 13% of cases.
This study demonstrated the potential of this approach for increasing the levels of dystrophin in the short term. The trial’s principal aim was to work out the appropriate dosages of the drug, therefore the drug’s safety profile and effects will need to be confirmed in larger, longer-term studies, particularly as patients would need to take it for the rest of their lives (or until a better treatment is available).<ref name=Cirak2011>{{cite journal |last1=Cirak |first1=Sebahattin |last2=Arechavala-Gomeza |first2=Virginia |last3=Guglieri |first3=Michela |last4=Feng |first4=Lucy |last5=Torelli |first5=Silvia |last6=Anthony |first6=Karen |last7=Abbs |first7=Stephen |last8=Garralda |first8=Maria Elena |last9=Bourke |first9=John |last10=Wells |first10=Dominic J |last11=Dickson |first11=George |last12=Wood |first12=Matthew JA |last13=Wilton |first13=Steve D |last14=Straub |first14=Volker |last15=Kole |first15=Ryszard |last16=Shrewsbury |first16=Stephen B |last17=Sewry |first17=Caroline |last18=Morgan |first18=Jennifer E |last19=Bushby |first19=Kate |last20=Muntoni |first20=Francesco |title=Exon skipping and dystrophin restoration in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy after systemic phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer treatment: an open-label, phase 2, dose-escalation study |journal=The Lancet |volume=378 |issue=9791 |pages=595–605 |year=2011 |pmid=21784508 |pmc=3156980 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60756-3 |laysummary=http://www.nhs.uk/news/2011/07July/Pages/research-new-drug-muscular-dystrophy.aspx |laysource=NHS Choices |laydate=July 25, 2011 }}</ref>

A similar drug was also in clinical trials, [[drisapersen]], which is a 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate antisense oligo that, like eteplirsen, triggers skipping of dystrophin exon 51. In January 2016, the FDA rejected drisapersen (Kyndrisa) for lack of efficacy, effectively shifting focus to eteplirsen.<ref>[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fda-rejects-biomarins-dmd-drug-135156448.html FDA rejects BioMarin's muscle wasting drug; Sarepta drug in focus. Jan 2016]</ref>

==Current status==
Eterplirsen has received accelerated approval from the US FDA.<ref name=FDAapprove />

Both eteplirsen and the similar drug drisapersen  filed [[New Drug Application]] (NDA) for review with the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).<ref>{{cite news|title=FDA Accepts Sarepta's NDA for Eteplirsen|url=http://www.raredr.com/news/fda-accepts-sareptas-nda-for-eteplirsen|publisher=Rare Disease Report}}</ref>
The Prescription Drug User Fee Act ([[PDUFA]]) goal dates for these were December 27, 2015 for drisapersen and February 26, 2016 for eteplirsen. Following FDA rejection of drisapersen, the agency announced a three-month time extension for its review of eteplirsen. The FDA panel decision was controversial because the FDA staff and the panel used a stricter standard of evidence than Sarepta and patient groups used. The FDA panel said that it was required by law to apply the standard of “substantial evidence” of effectiveness. This required randomized, controlled trials showing effectivenes of a meaningful clinical outcome, such as the ability to function in daily life. Sarepta and the patient groups wanted to use the standard of historical controls, personal testimonies, and the presence of altered dystrophin in the body. On April 25, 2016, the Advisory Committee Panel voted against approval;.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/26/business/muscular-dystrophy-drug-fda-sarepta-eteplirsen.html</ref> In June 2016, FDA requested for additional data from Sarepta, to confirm findings of dystrophin production by Eteplirsen. [[Janet Woodcock]], director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, overruled the panel, and FDA Commissioner [[Robert Califf]] deferred to her decision. Eterplirsen received accelerated approval on September 19, 2016.<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-muscular-dystrophy-drug-20161028-story.html  Column: To appease a patient lobby, did the FDA approve a $300,000 drug that doesn't work?

==Pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and potential side effects==

On January 22, 2016 the FDA Briefing Document containing information about eteplirsen (ND 206488) was submitted to the Peripheral and Central Nervous System Advisory Committee Meeting. The most common treatment for DMD is glucocorticoid use, which do not sufficiently ameliorate symptoms or address the underlying genetic mutation and lack of functional dystrophin. Part of the document included the following information pertaining to the pharmacokinetic properties of eteplirsen:<ref name=AdvisoryCommittee />

* Clinical safety data shows that there has been no adverse effects from treatment with Eteplirsen-based off the doses administered in several trials.
* In general, dose-proportionality and linearity in PK properties may be concluded following weekly doses of 0.5~20&nbsp;mg/kg in Phase 1 dose-ranging study and 30 and 50&nbsp;mg/kg in efficacy trials. There was insignificant drug accumulation following weekly dosing across this dose range of 0.5~50&nbsp;mg/kg
* Eteplirsen is not metabolized by hepatic microsomes and was not a potent inducer or inhibitor of the major human CYP enzymes, and was not a substrate, nor did it have any major inhibitory potential for any of the key human drug transporters at the concentration range given in clinical trials. Based on these findings, it is expected to have a low potential for drug-drug interactions (DDI) in humans.
* Eteplirsen was found to be metabolically stable ''in vitro'' with no evidence of metabolism or metabolite formation. 
* Most of the metabolism of eteplirsen is done through the kidneys.
* Following single or multiple IV infusion, the peak plasma concentrations (C<sub>max</sub>) of eteplirsen occurred near the end of infusion and plasma concentration-time profiles of eteplirsen were generally similar and showed multi-phasic decline; the majority of drug elimination occurred within 24 hours. 
* Plasma protein binding of eteplirsen in human is relatively low, ranging 6.1~16.5% and is independent of concentration studied.

==Nature and sequence of oligo and target==

Eteplirsen is a morpholino phosphorodiamidate antisense oligomer.
