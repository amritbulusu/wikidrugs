'''Idoxuridine''' is an anti-[[herpesvirus]] [[antiviral drug]].

It is a [[nucleoside analogue]], a modified form of [[deoxyuridine]], similar enough to be incorporated into viral [[DNA replication]], but the [[iodine]] atom added to the [[uracil]] component blocks [[base pair]]ing. It is used only topically due to cardiotoxicity. It was synthesized by [[William Prusoff]] in the late 1950s.<ref>Prusoff, W.H. (1959) ''Synthesis and biological activities of iododeoxyuridine, an analog of thymidine.'' [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13628760 Biochim Biophys Acta. March; 32(1): 295–296.]</ref> Initially developed as an anticancer drug, idoxuridine became the first antiviral agent in 1962.<ref name="Wilhelmus">{{cite journal |author= Wilhelmus KR |title= Antiviral treatment and other therapeutic interventions for herpes simplex virus epithelial keratitis |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume=12 |pages= CD002898 |date=2010 |pmid= 21154352|doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD002898.pub4 |pmc=4739528}}</ref>

==Clinical use==
Idoxuridine is mainly used topically to treat [[herpes simplex]] [[keratitis]].<ref name="Goodman">Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. Edited by Gilman AG, Rall TW, Nies AS, Taylor P. McGraw-Hill. 8th ed. 1990.</ref> Epithelial lesions, especially initial attacks presenting with a dendritic ulcer, are most responsive to therapy, while infection with stromal involvement are less responsive.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Maxwell | first1 = E | year = 1963 | title = Treatment of herpes keratitis with 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine (IDU): a clinical evaluation of 1500 cases | url = | journal = Am.

==Side effects==
Common side effects of the eye drops include irritation, blurred vision and [[photophobia]].<ref>Drugs.com: [http://www.drugs.com/mtm/idoxuridine-ophthalmic.html Idoxuridine ophthalmic]</ref> [[Cornea]]l clouding and damage of the corneal epithelium may also occur.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Formulations and dosage==
Idoxuridine is available as either a 0.5% ophthalmic [[ointment]] or as a 0.1% ophthalmic [[solution]].<ref name="Goodman"/> The dosage of the ointment is every 4 hours during day and once before bedtime.<ref name="Goodman"/> The dosage of the solution is 1 drop in the [[conjunctiva|conjunctival sac]] hourly during the day and every 2 hours during the night until definitive improvement, then 1 drop every 2 hours during the day and every 4 hours during the night.<ref name="Goodman"/> Therapy is continued for 3–4 days after healing is complete, as demonstrated by [[fluorescein]] staining.<ref name="Goodman"/>
