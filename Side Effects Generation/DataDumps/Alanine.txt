'''Alanine''' (abbreviated as '''Ala''' or '''A''') is an α-[[amino acid]] that is used in the biosynthesis of [[Protein|proteins]]. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated form, −NH3<sup>+</sup>, under biological conditions), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated form, −COO<sup>−</sup>, under biological conditions), and a side chain [[methyl group]], making it a [[Chemical polarity|nonpolar]], [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] amino acid. It is non-essential in humans: because the body can synthesize it, it does not need to be present in the diet. It is one of the 20 [[amino acid]]s encoded by the human [[genetic code]], and is encoded by all codons starting with GC, namely GCU, GCC, GCA, and GCG.

The <small>L</small>-isomer of alanine ([[chirality|left-handed]]) is the one that is incorporated into proteins. <small>L</small>-Alanine is second only to [[leucine]] in rate of occurrence, accounting for 7.8% of the [[primary structure]] in a sample of 1,150 [[proteins]].<ref>{{citation | last1 = Doolittle | first1 = R.

==Structure==
Alanine is an [[aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] amino acid, because the side-chain connected to the [[alpha carbon|α-carbon]] atom is a [[methyl]] group (-CH<sub>3</sub>), making it the simplest α-amino acid except for [[glycine]]. The methyl side-chain of alanine is non-reactive and is therefore hardly ever directly involved in protein function.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MITRpqnrHYQC&pg=PT47|title=Textbook of Biotechnology|date=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (I)|isbn=9780071070072|language=en}}</ref>

Because alanine's side-chain cannot be phosphorylated, it is useful in [[genetic engineering|loss of function experiments]] with respect to [[phosphorylation]]. Some techniques involve creating a library of genes, each of which has a point mutation at a different position in the area of interest, sometimes even every position in the whole gene: this is called "scanning mutagenesis". The simplest method, and the first to have been used, is so-called "alanine scanning", where every position in turn is mutated to alanine.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ycVoWFqDTmAC&pg=PA94|title=Protein Engineering and Design|last=Park|first=Sheldon J.|last2=Cochran|first2=Jennifer R.|date=2009-09-25|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781420076592|language=en}}</ref>

==Sources==
===Dietary sources===
Alanine is a [[essential amino acid|nonessential amino acid]], meaning it can be manufactured by the human body, and does not need to be obtained through the diet. Alanine is found in a wide variety of foods, but is particularly concentrated in meats.

===Biosynthesis===
Alanine can be synthesized from [[pyruvate]] and [[Branched-chain amino acids|branched chain amino acids]] such as [[valine]], [[leucine]], and [[isoleucine]].

Alanine is most commonly produced by [[reductive amination]] of [[pyruvate]], a two-step process. In the first step, [[Alpha-Ketoglutaric acid|α-ketoglutarate]], [[ammonia]] and [[NADH]] are converted by [[glutamate dehydrogenase]] to [[glutamate]], NAD<sup>+</sup> and water. In the second step, the amino group of the newly-formed glutamate is transferred to pyruvate by an [[aminotransferase]] enzyme, regenerating the α-ketoglutarate, and converting the pyruvate to alanine. The net result is that pyruvate and ammonia are converted to alanine, consuming one [[reducing equivalent]].<ref name=":0" /><sup>p.721</sup> Because [[transamination]] reactions are readily reversible and pyruvate is present in all cells, alanine can be easily formed and thus has close links to metabolic pathways such as [[glycolysis]], [[gluconeogenesis]], and the [[citric acid cycle]].

===Chemical synthesis===
[[Racemic]] alanine can be prepared by the condensation of [[acetaldehyde]] with [[ammonium chloride]] in the presence of [[sodium cyanide]] by the [[Strecker amino acid synthesis|Strecker reaction]], or by the [[ammonolysis]] of [[2-bromopropanoic acid]]:<ref>{{OrgSynth | last1 = Kendall | first1 = E.

=== Degradation ===
Alanine is broken down by [[oxidative deamination]], the inverse reaction of the reductive amination reaction described above, catalyzed by the same enzymes. The direction of the process is largely controlled by the relative concentration of the substrates and products of the reactions involved.<ref name=":0" /><sup>p.721</sup>

==Physiological function==
===Glucose–alanine cycle===
In mammals, alanine plays a key role in [[glucose–alanine cycle]] between tissues and liver. In muscle and other tissues that degrade amino acids for fuel, amino groups are collected in the form of [[Glutamic acid|glutamate]] by [[transamination]]. Glutamate can then transfer its amino group to [[pyruvate]], a product of muscle [[glycolysis]], through the action of [[alanine aminotransferase]], forming alanine and [[α-ketoglutarate]]. The alanine enters the bloodstream, and is transported to the liver. The alanine aminotransferase reaction takes place in reverse in the liver, where the regenerated pyruvate is used in [[gluconeogenesis]], forming glucose which returns to the muscles through the circulation system. Glutamate in the liver enters [[mitochondria]] and is broken down by [[glutamate dehydrogenase]] into α-ketoglutarate and [[ammonium ion|ammonium]], which in turn participates in the [[urea cycle]] to form [[urea]] which is excreted through the kidneys.<ref name="Lehninger">{{Lehninger4th|pages=684–85}}.</ref>

The glucose–alanine cycle enables pyruvate and glutamate to be removed from the muscle and safely transported to the liver, where glucose is regenerated from pyruvate and then returned to muscle: this moves the energetic burden of gluconeogenesis to the liver instead of the muscle, and all available [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] in the muscle can be devoted to muscle contraction.<ref name="Lehninger"/> It is a catabolic pathway, and relies upon protein breakdown in the muscle tissue. Whether and to what extent it occurs in non-mammals is unclear.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=P42VIrgYpKoC&pg=PA23|title=Fish Physiology: Nitrogen Excretion|last=|first=|date=2001-09-07|publisher=Academic Press|year=|isbn=9780080497518|location=|pages=23|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=H5d2k2b1cWQC&pg=PA172|title=Nitrogen Metabolism and Excretion|last=Walsh|first=Patrick J.|last2=Wright|first2=Patricia A.|date=1995-08-31|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780849384110|language=en}}</ref>

===Link to diabetes===
Alterations in the alanine cycle that increase the levels of serum [[alanine aminotransferase]] (ALT) are linked to the development of type II diabetes.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/492759 | title = Elevated Alanine Aminotransferase Predicts New-Onset Type 2 Diabetes Independently of Classical Risk Factors, Metabolic Syndrome, and C-Reactive Protein in the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study}}</ref>

==Chemical properties==
[[File:Zwitterion-Alanine.png|thumb|250px|(''S'')-Alanine (left) and (''R'')-alanine (right) in zwitterionic form at neutral pH]]
===Free radical stability===
The [[deamination]] of an alanine molecule produces a stable alkyl [[Radical (chemistry)|free radical]], CH<sub>3</sub>C<sup>•</sup>HCOO<sup>−</sup>. Deamination can be induced in solid or aqueous alanine by radiation.<ref>{{citation | journal = J. Radioanal. Nucl. Chem. | title = Transients and stable radical from the deamination of α-alanine | first1 = Z. P. | last1 = Zagórski | first2 = K. | last2 = Sehested | doi = 10.1007/BF02383729 | year = 1998 | volume = 232 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 139–41}}.</ref>

This property of alanine is used in [[dosimetry|dosimetric measurements]] in [[radiotherapy]].  When normal alanine is irradiated, the radiation causes certain alanine molecules to become free radicals, and, as these radicals are stable, the free radical content can later be measured by electron paramagnetic resonance in order to find out how much radiation the alanine was exposed to.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/990023546|title=Fundamentals of ionizing radiation dosimetry|last=Pedro,|first=Andreo,|date=|publisher=WILEY-VCH|others=Burns, David T.,, Nahum, Alan E.,, Seuntjens, Jan P.,, Attix, Frank H.,|year=2017|isbn=9783527808236|edition=2nd edition|location=Weinheim, Germany|pages=547|oclc=990023546}}</ref> This is considered to be a biologically relevant measure of the amount of radiation damage that living tissue would suffer under the same radiation exposure.<ref name=":1" /> Radiotherapy treatment plans can be delivered in test mode to alanine pellets, which can then be measured to check that the intended pattern of radiation dose is correctly delivered by the treatment system.
