==Medical uses==
Oxamniquine is used for treatment of [[schistosomiasis]]. According to one systematic review,  [[praziquantel]] is the standard treatment for  ''[[Schistosoma|S. mansoni]]'' infections and oxamniquine also appears effective.<ref name="pmid23450530">{{cite journal |vauthors=Danso-Appiah A, Olliaro PL, Donegan S, Sinclair D, Utzinger J |title=Drugs for treating Schistosoma mansoni infection |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD000528 |year=2013 |pmid=23450530 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000528.pub2 |url=}}</ref>

==Side effects==
It is generally well tolerated following oral doses. Dizziness with or without drowsiness occurs in at least a third of patients, beginning up to three hours after a dose, and usually lasts for up to six hours. Headache and gastrointestinal effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, are also common.

Allergic-type reactions, including urticaria, pruritic skin rashes, and fever, may occur. Liver enzyme values have been raised transiently in some patients. Epileptiform convulsions have been reported, especially in patients with a history of convulsive disorders. Hallucinations and excitement have occurred rarely.

A reddish discoloration of urine, probably due to a metabolite of oxamniquine, has been reported.

Oxamniquine is not recommended during pregnancy.<ref name=WHO2008/>

==Pharmacokinetics==
Peak [[blood plasma|plasma]] concentrations are achieved one to three hours after a dose, and the plasma half-life is 1.0 to 2.5 hours.

It is extensively metabolised to inactive metabolites, principally the 6-carboxy derivative, which are excreted in the urine. About 70% of a dose of oxamniquine is excreted as the 6-carboxy metabolite within 12 hours of a dose; traces of the 2-carboxy metabolite have also been detected in the urine.

==Mechanism of action==
It is an [[anthelmintic]] with [[Schistosoma|schistosomicidal]] activity against ''[[Schistosoma mansoni]]'', but not against other ''Schistosoma'' spp. Oxamniquine is a potent single-dose agent for treatment of ''S. mansoni'' infection, and it causes worms to shift from the [[mesentery|mesenteric]] veins to the [[liver]], where the male worms are retained; the female worms return to the mesentery, but can no longer release eggs.<ref>Martidale, ''The Extra Pharmacopoeia'', 31st ed, p121</ref>

Oxamniquine is a semisynthetic tetrahydroquinoline and possibly acts by [[DNA]] binding, resulting in contraction and paralysis of the worms and eventual detachment from terminal [[venules]] in the mesentry, and death. Its biochemical mechanisms are hypothesized to be related to an anticholinergic effect, which increases the parasiteâ€™s motility, as well as to synthesis inhibition of nucleic acids. Oxamniquine acts mainly on male worms, but also induces small changes on a small proportion of females. Like [[praziquantel]], it promotes more severe damage of the dorsal tegument than of the ventral surface. The drug causes the male worms to shift from the mesenteric circulation to the liver, where the cellular host response causes its final elimination. The changes caused in the females are reversible and are due primarily to the discontinued male stimulation rather than the direct effect of oxamniquine.

==History==
Oxamniquine was first described by Kaye and Woolhouse in 1972 as a [[metabolite]] of the compound UK 3883 (2-isopropylaminomethyl-6-methyl-7-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline). Initially, it was prepared by microbiological [[hydroxylation]] in the presence of the fungus ''[[Aspergillus sclerotiorum]]''. In 1979, [[Pfizer]] at [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]] was presented with the [[Queen's Awards for Enterprise|Queen's Award for Technological Achievement]] in recognition of the outstanding contribution made to tropical medicine by MANSIL (oxamniquine).
