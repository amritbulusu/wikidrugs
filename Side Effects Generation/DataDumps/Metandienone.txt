==Side effects==
{{See also|Anabolic steroid#Adverse effects}}

==Pharmacology==
Metandienone binds to and activates the [[androgen receptor]] (AR) in order to exert its effects.<ref>{{cite journal|date=May 1998|title=The effect of anabolic-androgenic steroids on aromatase activity and androgen receptor binding in the rat preoptic area|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006-8993(98)00148-6|journal=Brain Res.|volume=792|issue=2|pages=271–6|doi=10.1016/S0006-8993(98)00148-6|pmid=9593936|author=Roselli CE}}</ref> These include dramatic increases in [[protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]], [[glycogenolysis]], and muscle strength over a short space of time.{{medcn|date=April 2014}} Side effects such as [[gynecomastia]], high [[blood pressure]], [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] and [[male pattern baldness]] may begin to occur. The drug causes severe masculinizing effects in women even at low doses. In addition, it is metabolized into [[methylestradiol]] by [[aromatase]].<ref name="Llewellyn2011" /> This means that without the administration of [[aromatase inhibitor]]s such as [[anastrozole]] or [[aminoglutethimide]], [[estrogen]]ic effects like [[gynecomastia]] (breast development) may appear over time in men. Many users combat the estrogenic side effects with [[anastrozole]], [[tamoxifen]] or [[clomifene]]. In addition, as with other 17α-alkylated steroids, the use of metandienone over extended periods of time can result in [[cirrhosis|liver damage]] without appropriate precautions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The 17α-methylation of the steroid does allow it to pass through the liver with only a small portion of it broken down (hence causing the aforementioned damage to the liver) allowing it to be effective when taken orally. It also has the effect of decreasing the steroid's affinity for [[sex hormone-binding globulin]], a protein that deactivates steroid molecules and prevents them from further reactions with the body. As a result, metandienone is significantly more active than an equivalent quantity of testosterone, resulting in rapid growth of muscle tissue. However, the concomitant elevation in estrogen levels – a result of the aromatization of metandienone – results in significant water retention. This gives the appearance of bad gains in mass and strength, which proves to be temporary once the steroid is discontinued and water weight drops. Because of this, it is often used by bodybuilders at the start of a "steroid cycle", to facilitate rapid strength increases and the appearance of great size, while compounds such as testosterone cypionate or testosterone enanthate with long acting [[ester]]s build up in the body to an appreciable amount capable of supporting [[anabolic]] function on their own.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Metandienone, also known structurally as '''17α-methyl-δ<sup>1</sup>-testosterone''' or as '''17α-methylandrost-1,4-dien-17β-ol-3-one''', is a [[17α-alkylated anabolic steroid|17α-alkylated]] [[androstane]] [[steroid]] and a [[chemical derivative|derivative]] of testosterone.<ref name="Elks2014" /> It is a [[structural modification|modification]] of testosterone with a [[methyl group]] at the C17α position and an additional [[double bond]] between the C1 and C2 positions.<ref name="Elks2014" /> The drug is also the 17α-methylated derivative of [[boldenone]] (δ<sup>1</sup>-testosterone) and the δ<sup>1</sup> [[structural analog|analogue]] of [[methyltestosterone]] (17α-methyltestosterone).<ref name="Elks2014" />

===Detection in body fluids===
Metandienone is subject to extensive hepatic biotransformation by a variety of enzymatic pathways. The primary urinary metabolites are detectable for up to 3 days, and a recently discovered hydroxymethyl metabolite is found in urine for up to 19 days after a single 5&nbsp;mg oral dose.<ref>Schänzer W, Geyer H, Fusshöller G, Halatcheva N, Kohler M, Parr MK, Guddat S, Thomas A, Thevis M.

==History==
Metandienone was first synthesized in 1956 by researchers at the [[Novartis#Ciba-Geigy|CIBA]] laboratories in Basel, Switzerland. CIBA filed for a US patent in 1957,<ref>{{Citation|last=Albert|first=Wettstein|title=Process for the manufacture of steroid dehydrogenation products|date=Aug 18, 1959|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US2900398|inventor-last=Albert|inventor2-last=Alfred|inventor3-last=Charles|inventor-first=Wettstein|inventor2-first=Hunger|inventor3-first=Meystre|last2=Alfred|last3=Charles|last4=Ludwig|first2=Hunger|first3=Meystre|first4=Ehmann|issue=US2900398 A|accessdate=2017-01-14}}</ref> and began marketing the compound as Dianabol in 1958.<ref name=":3">{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/dianabol-widely-steroid-turns-50-year-article-1.292864|title=Dianabol, the first widely used steroid, turns 50|newspaper=NY Daily News|access-date=2017-01-14}}</ref>

Beginning soon afterwards in 1959, CIBA collaborated with [[John Bosley Ziegler]] (a physician specializing in physical rehabilitation and an early pioneer of [[Performance-enhancing substance|pharmaceutical performance enhancement]]) to test the effects of Dianabol on professional weightlifters. Ziegler had a close relationship with [[Bob Hoffman (promoter)|Bob Hoffman]], owner of [[York Barbell|York Barbell Company]] and coach of the US Olympic weightlifting team,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://startingstrength.com/articles/ultimate_exercise_starr.pdf|title=The Ultimate Strength Exercise 1, Bill Starr|date=|format=PDF|accessdate=2012-02-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://startingstrength.com/articles/ultimate_exercise_2_starr.pdf|title=The Ultimate Strength Exercise 2, Bill Starr|date=|format=PDF|accessdate=2012-02-13}}</ref> granting him access to subjects in peak performance condition.<ref name=":4">{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/sports_nut/2005/02/the_man_behind_the_juice.html|title=The Man Behind the Juice|last=Peters|first=Justin|date=2005-02-18|newspaper=Slate|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339|access-date=2017-01-14}}</ref><ref name=":3" /><ref name=":1" />

The first tentative experiments were disappointing. For example, [[AAU Mr. America]] winner Jim Park reported that "its only effect was to give him an instant erection upon seeing any female." However, Ziegler believed that Dianabol had significant potential as an anabolic. During the lead-up to the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympics]], he proposed to Hoffman that it be administered to top members of the American [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] team. Hoffman, however, was cautious and later remarked it was "too close to give to the men who will represent the USA". According to Grimek, "apparently, he doesn’t think it will do that much good, and may even have detrimental effects, ... He appears doubtful." <ref name=":1" />

Instead, Dianabol was given to various lower level lifters to investigate its effectiveness and safety. Among the first subjects were [[John Grimek]], [[Bill March]], [[Charles Vinci]], and [[Louis Riecke]], as well as Ziegler and Hoffman themselves.<ref name=":1" /> Hoffman later commented on the startling effects of the new drug, saying that "in five days I could curl and press more and I gained weight", and that "when I went to a weight lifting contest, or when I had my coat off anywhere, people would say, ‘Where did you get all those muscles?’”.<ref name=":1" /> Riecke gained muscle mass and strength rapidly, and reported a "constant feeling of euphoria and energy." His results drew enormous interest among other elite weightlifters, and rumors spread that Ziegler had made a major breakthrough in his research. He attempted to deflect their curiosity with hints of new [[Isometric exercise device|isometric]] and [[Hypnosis|hypnotic]] techniques.<ref name=":1" />

Over the course of the next 2 years, Ziegler's work with Riecke further explored the new drug's physical and psychological effects. Riecke's performance and mood consistently improved while taking Dianabol, and dramatically declined when he did not take it. John Fair also suggests that Riecke was among the first cases of steroid dependency, at one point "mentioning the pills four times in [one] letter, twice being reminders for Ziegler to send more."<ref name=":1" />

From 1962 onward, it became increasingly difficult for Ziegler and others to keep their results secret, and word of Dianabol's spectacular performance-enhancing effects gradually spread among competitors in other sports where strength or mass were critical factors in an athlete's success. [[American football]] players and coaches were particularly interested in the new "anabolic".<ref name=":4" /> Early adopters included players for [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma University]] and [[Los Angeles Chargers|San Diego Chargers]] head coach [[Sid Gillman]], who administered Dianabol to his team starting in 1963.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/otl/news/story?id=3866837|title=OTL: Football's first steroids team?

After the [[Kefauver Harris Amendment]] was passed in 1962, the US [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] began the [[Drug Efficacy Study Implementation|DESI]] review process to ensure the safety and efficacy of drugs approved under the more lenient pre-1962 standards, including Dianabol.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fourcroy|first=Jean|title=Designer steroids: past, present and future|url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&an=00060793-200606000-00012|journal=Current Opinion in Endocrinology and Diabetes|volume=13|issue=3|pages=306–309|doi=10.1097/01.med.0000224812.46942.c3}}</ref> In 1965, the FDA pressured CIBA to further document its legitimate medical uses, and re-approved the drug for treating [[Postmenopausal osteoporosis|post-menopausal osteoporosis]] and [[Dwarfism|pituitary-deficient dwarfism]].<ref name=":5">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=afKLA-6wW0oC&pg=PT446&lpg=PT446&dq=dianabol+ciba+fda&source=bl&ots=Me1glKhY5H&sig=bM0w4UzWm4nIr3YwH2cxxj3PHjs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjx4uGy1MLRAhUJKWMKHQTuAIkQ6AEIIDAB#v=onepage&q=dianabol%20ciba%20fda&f=false|title=Anabolics|last=Llewellyn|first=William|date=2011-01-01|publisher=Molecular Nutrition Llc|isbn=9780982828014|language=en}}</ref> After CIBA's [[Pharmaceutical patent|patent exclusivity period]] lapsed, other manufacturers began to market [[Generic drug|generic]] metandienone in the US.
