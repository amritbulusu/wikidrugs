== Medical use ==
Doxorubicin is commonly used to treat some [[leukemia]]s and [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]], as well as cancers of the [[bladder cancer|bladder]], [[breast cancer|breast]], [[stomach cancer|stomach]], [[lung cancer|lung]], [[ovarian cancer|ovaries]], [[thyroid cancer|thyroid]], [[soft tissue sarcoma]], [[multiple myeloma]], and others.<ref name = MD/><ref name = AMH/> Commonly used doxorubicin-containing [[chemotherapy regimen|regimens]] are AC (adriamycin, [[cyclophosphamide]]), TAC ([[taxotere]], AC), [[ABVD]] (Adriamycin, [[bleomycin]], [[vinblastine]], [[dacarbazine]]), [[BEACOPP]], [[CHOP]] (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, [[vincristine]], [[prednisone]]) and FAC ([[5-fluorouracil]], adriamycin, cyclophosphamide).<ref name = MD/>

Doxil (see below) is used primarily for the treatment of ovarian cancer where the disease has progressed or recurred after [[cisplatin|platinum-based chemotherapy]], or for the treatment of [[AIDS]]-related [[Kaposi's sarcoma]].<ref name="Doxil_info">"[http://www.orthobiotech.com/common/prescribing_information/DOXIL/PDF/DOXIL_PI_Booklet.pdf DOXIL Product Information]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921075517/http://www.orthobiotech.com/common/prescribing_information/DOXIL/PDF/DOXIL_PI_Booklet.pdf |date=September 21, 2007 }}."

===Liposomal form===<!--Liposomal doxorubicin, Doxil, Caelyx, Myocet redirect here!-->
There is a [[pegylated]] (polyethylene glycol coated) [[liposome]]-encapsulated form of doxorubicin, sold as Doxil. It was developed to treat [[Kaposi's sarcoma]], an [[AIDS]]-related cancer that causes lesions to grow under the skin, in the lining of the mouth, nose and throat, or in other organs. The [[polyethylene glycol]] coating results in preferential concentration of doxorubicin in the skin. However, this also results in a side effect called [[palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia]] (PPE), more commonly known as hand-foot syndrome.  Following administration of this form of doxorubicin, small amounts of the drug can leak from capillaries in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.  The result of this leakage is redness, tenderness, and peeling of the skin that can be uncomfortable and even painful.  In clinical testing at 50&nbsp;mg/m<sup>2</sup> dosing every 4 weeks, half of people developed hand-foot syndrome. The rate of this side effect limits the dose of this formulation that can be given as compared with plain doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen, thereby limiting potential substitution. Substitution would be desirable because liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin is less cardiotoxic than unencapsulated doxorubicin.  This form is also approved by the FDA for treatment of ovarian cancer and multiple myeloma.<ref name=Macmillan>{{cite web |url=http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Cancerinformation/Cancertreatment/Treatmenttypes/Chemotherapy/Individualdrugs/Liposomaldoxorubicin.aspx |title=Liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx, Myocet) |publisher=Macmillan Cancer Support |date=April 1, 2009 |accessdate=2009-11-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091129030936/http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Cancerinformation/Cancertreatment/Treatmenttypes/Chemotherapy/Individualdrugs/Liposomaldoxorubicin.aspx |archivedate=November 29, 2009 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chemocare.com/bio/doxorubicin_liposomal.asp |title=Doxorubicin liposomal |publisher=[[Cleveland Clinic]] |work=Chemocare |accessdate=2009-11-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102095755/http://chemocare.com/bio/doxorubicin_liposomal.asp |archivedate=2010-01-02 |df= }}</ref>

A non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, called Myocet, is approved in Europe and Canada for treatment of metastatic breast cancer in combination with [[cyclophosphamide]], but has not been approved by the FDA for use in the United States. Unlike Doxil, the Myocet liposome does not have a polyethylene glycol coating, and therefore does not result in the same rate of hand-foot syndrome. The minimization of this side effect may allow for one-for-one (1:1) substitution with doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen, thereby improving safety with no loss of efficacy. Like Doxil, the liposomal encapsulation of the doxorubicin limits the cardiotoxicity. In theory, by limiting the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin through liposomal encapsulation, it can be used safely in concurrent combination with other cardiotoxic chemotherapy drugs, such as trastuzumab. There is an FDA black box warning that trastuzumab cannot be used in concurrent combination with doxorubicin, only in sequential combination. Though concurrent combination of trastuzumab and doxorubicin in clinical studies found superior tumor response, the combination resulted in unacceptable cardiotoxicity, including risk of cardiac failure manifesting as [[congestive heart failure]] (CHF). Published phase II study results have shown that Myocet, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel can safely be used concurrently without the cardiac risk, as measured by reduction in [[LVEF]] function, while still achieving superior tumor response. This finding is the basis for the ongoing phase III trial for FDA approval.<ref name=Macmillan/>

== Side effects ==
The most dangerous side effect of doxorubicin is [[dilated cardiomyopathy]], leading to [[congestive heart failure]]. The rate of cardiomyopathy is dependent on its cumulative dose, with an incidence about 4% when the dose of doxorubicin is 500–550&nbsp;mg/m², 18% when the dose is 551–600&nbsp;mg/m² and 36% when the dose exceeds 600&nbsp;mg/m².<ref name="Chaterjee">{{cite journal|last=Chaterjee|first=Kanu|author2=Jianqing Zhang |author3=Norman Honbo |author4=Joel S.

Another common and potentially fatal complication of doxorubicin is [[typhlitis]], an acute life-threatening infection of the bowel.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaczmarek A, Brinkman BM, Heyndrickx L, Vandenabeele P, Krysko DV J | title = Severity of doxorubicin-induced small intestinal mucositis is regulated by the TLR-2 and TLR-9 pathways. | journal = J Pathol. | volume = 226 | issue = 4 | pages = 598–608 | year = 2012 | pmid =21960132 | doi =10.1002/path.3009}}</ref>

Additionally, some patients may develop [[palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia|PPE]], characterized by skin eruptions on the palms of the hand or soles of the feet, swelling, pain, and [[erythema]].<ref name="Doxil_info"/>

== Biosynthesis ==
{{main|Biosynthesis of doxorubicin}}
Doxorubicin (DXR) is a 14-[[hydroxylated]] version of [[daunorubicin]], the immediate precursor of DXR in its [[Biosynthesis|biosynthetic]] pathway. [[Daunorubicin]] is more abundantly found as a [[natural product]] because it is produced by a number of different [[wild type]] [[Strain (biology)|strains]] of ''[[Streptomyces]]''. In contrast, only one known non-[[wild type]] [[species]], ''[[Streptomyces peucetius]]'' [[subspecies]] ''cesius'' ATCC 27952, was initially found to be capable of producing the more widely used doxorubicin.<ref name="pmid9864344">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Lomovskaya N, Otten SL, Doi-Katayama Y, etal |title=Doxorubicin overproduction in ''Streptomyces peucetius'': cloning and characterization of the dnrU ketoreductase and dnrV genes and the doxA cytochrome P-450 hydroxylase gene |journal=J.

== History ==
{{see also|Anthracycline#History|Daunorubicin#History|History of cancer chemotherapy}}
In the 1950s, an Italian research company, [[Farmitalia]] Research Laboratories, began an organized effort to find anticancer compounds from soil-based microbes. A soil sample was isolated from the area surrounding the [[Castel del Monte, Apulia|Castel del Monte]], a 13th-century castle. A new strain of ''[[Streptomyces peucetius]]'', which produced a red pigment, was isolated, and an antibiotic from this bacterium was effective against tumors in mice. Since a group of French researchers discovered the same compound at about the same time, the two teams named the compound [[daunorubicin]], combining the name ''[[Dauni]]'', a pre-Roman tribe that occupied the area of Italy where the compound was isolated, with the French word for [[ruby]], ''rubis'', describing the color.<ref name="weiss">{{cite journal |author=Weiss RB |title=The anthracyclines: will we ever find a better doxorubicin? |journal=Seminars in Oncology |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=670–86 |date=December 1992 |pmid=1462166}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 5332105 | volume=60 | title=Clinical trials in Plasmodium falciparum malaria with a long-acting sulphonamide | year=1966 | journal=Trans.

However, by 1967, it was recognized that daunorubicin could produce fatal cardiac toxicity.<ref name="TanC">{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/1097-0142(1967)20:3<333::AID-CNCR2820200302>3.0.CO;2-K |vauthors=Tan C, Tasaka H, Yu KP, Murphy ML, Karnofsky DA |title=Daunomycin, an antitumor antibiotic, in the treatment of neoplastic disease.

Researchers at Farmitalia soon discovered that changes in biological activity could be made by minor changes in the structure of the compound. A strain of ''Streptomyces'' was mutated using ''N''-nitroso-''N''-methyl urethane, and this new strain produced a different, red-colored antibiotic. They named this new compound Adriamycin, after the [[Adriatic Sea]], and the name was later changed to doxorubicin to conform to the established naming convention.<ref name="pmid5365804"/> Doxorubicin showed better activity than daunorubicin against mouse tumors, and especially solid tumors. It also showed a higher [[therapeutic index]], yet the [[cardiotoxicity]] remained.<ref name="DiMarcoA">{{cite journal |vauthors=Di Marco A, Gaetani M, Scarpinato B |title=Adriamycin (NSC-123,127): a new antibiotic with antitumor activity |journal=Cancer Chemother Rep |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=33–7 |date=February 1969 |pmid=5772652}}</ref>

Doxorubicin and daunorubicin together can be thought of as prototype compounds for the [[anthracycline]]s. Subsequent research has led to many other anthracycline antibiotics, or analogs, and there are now over 2,000 known analogs of doxorubicin. By 1991, 553 of them had been evaluated in the screening program at the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI).<ref name="weiss"/> In 2016 GPX-150 was granted [[orphan drug]] designation by US FDA.<ref>[http://www.cancernetwork.com/sarcoma/investigational-sarcoma-drug-gpx-150-gets-orphan-drug-designation Investigational Sarcoma Drug GPX-150 Gets Orphan Drug Designation. 2016] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124010110/http://www.cancernetwork.com/sarcoma/investigational-sarcoma-drug-gpx-150-gets-orphan-drug-designation |date=2016-01-24 }}</ref>

==Society and culture==

===Names===
It is also known as hydroxydaunorubicin and hydroxydaunomycin.

It is sold under a number of different brand names, including Adriamycin PFS, Adriamycin RDF, or Rubex.<ref name=MD/>

===Formulations===
Doxorubicin is photosensitive, and containers are often covered by an aluminum bag and/or brown wax paper to prevent light from affecting it.<ref name = MD/> Doxorubicin is also available in [[liposome]]-encapsulated forms as Doxil ([[PEGylation|pegylated]] form), Myocet (nonpegylated form), and Caelyx, although these forms must also be given by intravenous injection.<ref name = MD/>

===Shortage===
As of February 2014, Doxil was available in limited supply.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/DrugShortages/ucm314739.htm#doxorubicin |title=Drug Shortages, doxorubicin |publisher=US Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=2014-02-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216065048/http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/DrugShortages/ucm314739.htm#doxorubicin |archivedate=2014-02-16 |df= }}</ref> In 2011, Doxil became available only in very limited supply due to production problems with the third-party manufacturer.

==Research==

[[Combination therapy]] experiments with [[sirolimus]] (rapamycin) and doxorubicin have shown promise in treating [[Akt]]-positive [[lymphoma]]s in mice.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wendel H, De Stanchina E, Fridman J, Malina A, Ray S, Kogan S, [[Carlos Cordon-Cardo|Cordon-Cardo C]], Pelletier J, Lowe S |title=Survival signalling by Akt and eIF4E in oncogenesis and cancer therapy |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=428 |issue=6980 |pages=332–7 |year=2004 |pmid=15029198 |doi=10.1038/nature02369}}</ref>

Recent animal research coupling a [[murine]] [[monoclonal antibody]] with doxorubicin has created an [[immunoconjugate]] that was able to eliminate [[HIV|HIV-1]] infection in mice. Current treatment with [[antiretroviral drug|antiretroviral therapy]] (ART) still leaves pockets of HIV within the host. The immunoconjugate could potentially provide a complementary treatment to ART to eradicate antigen-expressing [[T cell]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Johansson S, Goldenberg D, Griffiths G, Wahren B, Hinkula J | title = Elimination of HIV-1 infection by treatment with a doxorubicin-conjugated anti-envelope antibody | journal = AIDS | volume = 20 | issue = 15 | pages = 1911–1915 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16988511 | doi = 10.1097/01.aids.0000247111.58961.60}}</ref>

=== Antimalarial activity ===

There is some evidence for antimalarial activity for doxorubicin and similar compounds. In 2009, a compound similar in structure to doxorubicin was found to inhibit [[plasmepsin]] II, an enzyme unique to the malarial parasite ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]''.<ref name="friedman">{{cite journal |vauthors=Friedman R, Caflisch A |title= Discovery of Plasmepsin Inhibitors by Fragment-Based Docking and Consensus Scoring |journal=ChemMedChem |volume=4 |pages=1317–26 |year=2009 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122407624/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 |pmid=19472268 |issue=8 |doi=10.1002/cmdc.200900078}}</ref> The pharmaceutical company [[GlaxoSmithKline]] (GSK) later identified doxorubicin in a set of compounds that inhibit parasite growth <ref name="Gamo">{{cite journal |author= Gamo F-J |title= Thousands of chemical starting points for antimalarial lead identification |journal= Nature |volume= 465 |pages= 305–310 |year= 2010 |url= http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v465/n7296/full/nature09107.html |pmid= 20485427 |issue= 7296 |doi= 10.1038/nature09107 |display-authors= etal |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100526151113/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v465/n7296/full/nature09107.html |archivedate= 2010-05-26 |df=  }}</ref>

=== Fluorescence ===
Doxorubicin is also known to be fluorescent. This has often been used to characterize doxorubicin concentrations, and has opened the possibility of using the molecule as a [[theranostic]] agent. However, there are significant limitations, as doxorubicin's fluorescence spectrum is known to depend on a variety of factors, including the pH of the environment, solvent [[dielectric constant]] and others. Doxorubicin fluorescence is quenched by binding to DNA, and shielded by micelle encapsulation. It is also known to self-quench at high concentrations. In contrast, histone binding amplifies fluorescence.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Karukstis K, Thompson E, Whiles J, Rosenfeld R | year = 1998 | title = Deciphering the fluorescence signature of daunomycin and doxorubicin | url = | journal = Biophysical Chemistry | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 249–263 | doi=10.1016/s0301-4622(98)00150-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Mohan P, Rapoport N | year = 2010 | title = Doxorubicin as a Molecular Nanotheranostic Agent: Effect of Doxorubicin Encapsulation in Micelles or Nanoemulsions on the Ultrasound-Mediated Intracellular Delivery and Nuclear Trafficking | url = | journal = Mol.
