Metazocine is in Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act 1970 of the United States as a Narcotic with ACSCN 9240 with a 19 gram aggregate manufacturing quota as of 2014.  The free base conversion ratio for salts includes 0.81 for the hydrochloride and 0.74 for the hydrobromide. <ref>http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/quotas/2014/fr0825.htm</ref>  It is listed under the Single Convention for the Control of Narcotic Substances 1961 and is controlled in most countries in the same fashion as is morphine.

==Syntheses==
The [[prototype]] [[benzomorphan]], metazocine ('''6'''), can be obtained from a variation of the [[morphinan]] [[Organic synthesis|synthesis]].

Thus, reaction of the [[Grignard reagent]] from ''p''-methoxybenzyl chloride ('''1''') with the [[lutidine]] methiodide ('''2''') affords the benzylated dihydropyridine ('''3'''). Reduction of the [[enamine]] [[π-bond]] leads to the [[tetrahydropyridine]] ('''4'''). Cyclization by means of acid leads directly to the benzomorphan ring system ('''5'''). Demethylation of the aromatic ring system affords the [[phenol]]. Although this last compound is in fact a relatively potent analgesic, it is not available commercially as a [[drug]].
