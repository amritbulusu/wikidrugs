In 1848 [[Thomas Beecham (chemist)|Thomas Beecham]] launched his [[Beecham's Pills]] laxative in England, giving birth to the [[Beecham Group]]. In 1859 Beecham opened its first factory in [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]], [[Lancashire]].

[[John K. Smith]] opened his first pharmacy in Philadelphia in 1830. In 1865 [[Mahlon Kline]] joined the business, which 10 years later became Smith, Kline & Co. In 1891 it merged with French, Richard and Company, and in 1929 changed its name to [[SmithKline & French|Smith Kline & French Laboratories]] as it focused more on research. Years later it bought Norden Laboratories, a business doing research into animal health, and [[Recherche et Industrie Thérapeutiques]] in Belgium in 1963 to focus on vaccines. The company began to expand globally, buying seven laboratories in Canada and the United States in 1969. In 1982 it bought [[Allergan]], a manufacturer of eye and skincare products.<ref name="history"/>

SmithKline & French merged with Beckman Inc. in 1982 and changed its name to ''SmithKline Beckman''. In 1988 it bought its biggest competitor, International Clinical Laboratories, and in 1989 merged with [[Beecham (pharmaceutical company)|Beecham]] to form ''SmithKline Beecham plc''. The headquarters moved from the United States to England. To expand R&D in the United States, the company bought a new research center in 1995; another opened in 1997 in England at New Frontiers Science Park, [[Harlow]].<ref name="history"/>

==2012 criminal and civil settlement==

===Overview===
In July 2012 GSK pleaded guilty in the United States to criminal charges, and agreed to pay $3 billion, in what was the [[List of Largest Pharmaceutical Settlements|largest settlement]] until then between the Justice Department and a drug company. The $3 billion included a criminal fine of $956,814,400 and forfeiture of $43,185,600. The remaining $2 billion covered a civil settlement with the government under the [[False Claims Act]]. The investigation was launched largely on the basis of information from four whistleblowers who filed [[qui tam]] (whistleblower) lawsuits against the company under the False Claims Act.<ref name=USDOJJuly2012>[http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/July/12-civ-842.html "GlaxoSmithKline to Plead Guilty and Pay $3 Billion to Resolve Fraud Allegations and Failure to Report Safety Data"], United States Department of Justice, 2 July 2012.{{pb}}

The charges stemmed from GSK's promotion of the anti-depressants Paxil ([[paroxetine]]) and Wellbutrin ([[bupropion]]) for unapproved uses from 1998–2003, specifically as suitable for patients under the age of 18, and from its failure to report safety data about Avandia ([[rosiglitazone]]), both in violation of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]]. Other drugs promoted for unapproved uses were two inhalers, Advair ([[fluticasone/salmeterol]]) and Flovent ([[fluticasone propionate]]), as well as Zofran ([[ondansetron]]), Imitrex ([[sumatriptan]]), Lotronex ([[alosetron]]) and Valtrex ([[valaciclovir]]).<ref name=USDOJJuly2012/>

The settlement also covered reporting false best prices and underpaying rebates owed under the [[Medicaid Drug Rebate Program]], and kickbacks to physicians to prescribe GSK's drugs. There were all-expenses-paid spa treatments and hunting trips for doctors and their spouses, speakers' fees at conferences, and payment for articles [[Medical ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] by the company and placed by physicians in medical journals.<ref name=USDOJJuly2012/> The company set up a ghostwriting programme called CASPPER, initially to produce articles about Paxil but which was extended to cover Avandia.<ref>[[Max Baucus]], [[Chuck Grassley]], [http://finance.senate.gov/newsroom/chairman/download/?id=a5c07780-6351-4905-8c63-52e4a7a7a66b "Finance Committee Letter to the FDA Regarding Avandia"], United States Senate Finance Committee, 12 July 2010.<p>

As part of the settlement GSK signed a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement with the [[Department of Health and Human Services]], which obliged the company to make major changes in the way it did business, including changing its compensation programmes for its sales force and executives, and to implement and maintain transparency in its research practices and publication policies.<ref name=USDOJJuly2012/> It announced in 2013 that it would no longer pay doctors to promote its drugs or attend medical conferences, and that its sales staff would no longer have prescription targets.<ref name=Reuters17Dec2013>[http://sustainability.thomsonreuters.com/2013/12/17/gsk-stop-paying-doctors-major-marketing-overhaul "GSK to stop paying doctors in major marketing overhaul"], Thomson/Reuters, 17 December 2013.</ref>

The 2012 settlement included a criminal fine of $242,612,800 for failing to report safety data to the FDA about Avandia ([[rosiglitazone]]), a [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|diabetes]] drug approved in 1999, and a civil settlement of $657 million for making false claims about it. The Justice Department said GSK had promoted rosiglitazone to physicians with misleading information, including that it conferred cardiovascular benefits despite an FDA-mandated label warning of cardiovascular risks.<ref name=USDOJJuly2012/>

In 1999 [[John Buse]], a diabetes specialist, told medical conferences that rosiglitazone might carry an increased risk of cardiovascular problems. GSK threatened to sue him, called his university head of department, and persuaded him to sign a retraction.<ref>[http://www.finance.senate.gov/download/?id=883E903D-F973-4A74-8432-3C651C71B4B4 "The Intimidation of Dr. John Buse and the Diabetes Drug Avandia"], Committee on Finance, United States Senate, November 2007, pp. 2–4.</ref> GSK raised questions internally about the drug's safety in 2000, and in 2002 the company [[Medical ghostwriter|ghostwrote]] an article in [[Circulation (journal)|''Circulation'']] describing a GSK funded clinical trial that suggested rosiglitazone might have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular risk.<ref>[[Max Baucus]], [[Chuck Grassley]], [http://finance.senate.gov/newsroom/chairman/download/?id=a5c07780-6351-4905-8c63-52e4a7a7a66b "Finance Committee Letter to the FDA Regarding Avandia"], United States Senate Finance Committee, 12 July 2010; for internal concerns, p. 2 and attachment E, pp.&nbsp;20–35; for ghostwriting, p. 3 and attachment H, pp. 58–109; for the ghostwriting, attachment I, p. 110ff; for cover letter to ''Circulation'', attachment I, p.&nbsp;143; for the ghostwritten article, attachment I, pp.&nbsp;152–158.{{pb}}

The results of GSK's RECORD trial were published in June 2009.

===Paroxetine (Paxil/Seroxat)===
{{main|Study 329}}
[[File:Paroxetine pill.jpg|thumb|[[Paroxetine]], known as Paxil and Seroxat]]
GSK was fined for promoting Paxil/Seroxat ([[paroxetine]]) for treating depression in the under-18s, although the drug had not been approved for pediatric use.<ref name=USDOJJuly2012/>
Paxil had $4.97 billion worldwide sales in 2003.<ref name=CMAJ2004/> The company conducted nine clinical trials between 1994 and 2002, none of which showed that Paxil helped children with depression.<ref>Goldacre 2013, p. 58.</ref> From 1998 to 2003 it promoted the drug for the under-18s, paying physicians to go on all-expenses paid trips, five-star hotels and spas.<ref name=USDOJJuly2012/> From 2004 Paxil's label, along with those of similar drugs, included an FDA-mandated boxed warning that it might increase the risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour in patients under 18.<ref name=USDOJJuly2012/>

An internal SmithKline Beecham document said in 1998, about withheld data from two GSK studies: "It would be commercially unacceptable to include a statement that [pediatric] efficacy had not been demonstrated, as this would undermine the profile of paroxetine."<ref name=CMAJ2004>{{cite journal |author1=W.

There were concerns in the 2000s about the sugar and vitamin content of [[Ribena]], a [[blackcurrant]]-based [[syrup]] and [[soft drink]] owned by GSK until 2013. Produced in England by H.W. Carter & Co from the 1930s, the company's unbranded syrup was distributed to children as a source of [[vitamin C]] during World War II, which gave the drink a reputation as good for health. [[Beecham Group|Beecham]] bought H. W.

In 2001 the British [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA) required GSK to withdraw its claim that Ribena Toothkind, a lower-sugar variety, did not encourage tooth decay.

===SB Pharmco Puerto Rico===
In 2010 the US Department of Justice announced that GSK would pay a $150 million criminal fine and forfeiture, and a civil settlement of $600 million under the False Claims Act. The fines stemmed from production of improperly made and adulterated drugs from 2001 to 2005 at GSK's subsidiary, SB Pharmco Puerto Rico Inc., in Cidra, Puerto Rico, which at the time produced $5.5 billion of products each year. The drugs involved were [[Kytril]], an antiemetic; [[Bactroban]], used to treat skin infections; Paxil, the anti-depressant; and [[Avandamet]], a diabetes drug.<ref>[http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/October/10-civ-1205.html "GlaxoSmithKline to Plead Guilty & Pay $750 Million to Resolve Criminal and Civil Liability Regarding Manufacturing Deficiencies at Puerto Rico Plant"], U.S. Department of Justice, 26 October 2010.</ref> GSK closed the factory in 2009.<ref name=NYTPuerto>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/27/business/27drug.html | title = Glaxo to Pay $750 Million for Sale of Bad Products | work = The New York Times | date = 27 October 2010}}</ref>

According to the ''New York Times'', the case began in 2002 when GSK sent experts to fix problems cited by the FDA. The lead inspector recommended recalls of defective products, but they were not authorised; she was fired in 2003 and filed a whistleblower lawsuit. In 2005 federal marshals seized $2 billion worth of products, the largest such seizure in history.

===Market manipulation in the UK===
In February 2016 the company was fined more than £37 million by the [[Competition and Markets Authority]] for paying Generics UK, Alpharma and Norton Healthcare more than £50m between 2001 and 2004, in order to keep generic varieties of [[Paroxetine]] out of the NHS market. The generics companies were fined a further £8 million.  At the end of 2003 when generics were available in the UK the price of Paroxetine dropped 70%.<ref>{{cite news|title=Watchdog fines GSK £37m for paying to keep generic drugs out of UK market|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/pharmaceuticalsandchemicals/12153450/Watchdog-fines-GSK-37m-for-paying-to-keep-generic-drugs-out-of-UK-market.html|accessdate=12 February 2016|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=12 February 2016}}</ref>

===Miscellaneous===
Italian police sought bribery charges in May 2004 against 4,400 doctors and 273 GSK employees. GSK and its predecessor were accused of having spent £152m on physicians, pharmacists and others, giving them cameras, computers, holidays and cash. Doctors were alleged to have received cash based on the number of patients they treated with a cancer drug, [[topotecan]] (Hycamtin).<ref>John Hooper, Heather Stewart, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/may/27/italy.heatherstewart "Over 4,000 doctors face charges in Italian drugs scandal"], ''The Guardian'', 27 May 2004.</ref> The following month prosecutors in Munich accused 70–100 doctors of having accepted bribes from SmithKline Beecham between 1997 and 1999.

In 2006 in the United States GSK settled the largest tax dispute in IRS history, agreeing to pay $3.1&nbsp;billion. At issue were Zantac and other products sold in 1989–2005. The case revolved around intracompany [[transfer pricing]]—determining the share of profit attributable to the US subsidiaries of GSK and subject to tax by the IRS.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/12/business/worldbusiness/12glaxo.html "GlaxoSmithKline to Settle Tax Dispute With U.S."], Reuters, 12 September 2006; [https://www.irs.gov/uac/IRS-Accepts-Settlement-Offer-in-Largest-Transfer-Pricing-Dispute "IRS Accepts Settlement Offer in Largest Transfer Pricing Dispute"], IRS, 11 September 2006.</ref>
