==Medical uses==
Warfarin is used to decrease the tendency for [[thrombosis]] or as secondary prophylaxis (prevention of further episodes) in those individuals who have already formed a blood clot ([[thrombus]]). Warfarin treatment can help prevent formation of future blood clots and help reduce the risk of [[embolism]] (migration of a thrombus to a spot where it blocks blood supply to a vital organ).<ref name=AHFS>{{cite web|title=coumadin|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/coumadin.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203081242/http://www.drugs.com/monograph/coumadin.html|archivedate=3 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Warfarin is best suited for anticoagulation (clot formation inhibition) in areas of slowly running blood (such as in veins and the pooled blood behind artificial and natural valves) and in blood pooled in dysfunctional cardiac atria. Thus, common clinical indications for warfarin use are [[atrial fibrillation]], the presence of [[artificial heart valve]]s, [[deep venous thrombosis]], and [[pulmonary embolism]] (where the embolized clots first form in veins). Warfarin is also used in [[antiphospholipid syndrome]]. It has been used occasionally after heart attacks ([[myocardial infarction]]s), but is far less effective at preventing new thromboses in coronary arteries. Prevention of clotting in arteries is usually undertaken with [[antiplatelet drug]]s, which act by a different mechanism from warfarin (which normally has no effect on platelet function).<ref name=Hirsh>{{cite journal |author=Hirsh J, [[Valentin Fuster|Fuster V]], Ansell J, [[Jonathan L.

===Alternative anticoagulants===
{{Update|section|date=October 2016}}
In some countries, other coumarins are used instead of warfarin, such as [[acenocoumarol]] and [[phenprocoumon]]. These have a shorter (acenocoumarol) or longer (phenprocoumon) [[Biological half-life|half-life]], and are not completely interchangeable with warfarin. Several types of anticoagulant drugs offering the efficacy of warfarin without a need for monitoring, such as [[dabigatran]], [[apixaban]], [[edoxaban]] and [[rivaroxaban]], have been approved in a number of countries for classical warfarin uses like the more common types of atrial fibrillation, and others in the same drug classes are under development. There is a reversal agent available for dabigatran (idarucizumab)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm467300.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017133421/http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm467300.htm |archivedate=17 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> but not for apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban.<!--An initial failure was [[ximelagatran]] (trade name Exanta), however, reports of [[hepatotoxicity]] (liver damage) prompted its manufacturer to withdraw it from further development. A similar and later drug dabigatran has since been more successful--><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hirsh J, O'Donnell M, Eikelboom JW |title=Beyond unfractionated heparin and warfarin: current and future advances |journal=Circulation |volume=116 |issue=5 |pages=552–60 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17664384 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.685974 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/116/5/552 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608210734/http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/116/5/552 |archivedate=8 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===Dosing===
Dosing of warfarin is complicated because it is known to interact with many commonly used medications and [[Vitamin K#Food sources|certain foods]].<ref name=Holbrook2005>{{cite journal |vauthors=Holbrook AM, Pereira JA, Labiris R, McDonald H, Douketis JD, Crowther M, Wells PS | title = Systematic overview of warfarin and its drug and food interactions | journal = Arch. Intern. Med. | volume = 165 | issue = 10 | pages = 1095–106 |date=May 2005 | pmid = 15911722|doi = 10.1001/archinte.165.10.1095 }}</ref> These interactions may enhance or reduce warfarin's anticoagulation effect. To optimize the therapeutic effect without risking dangerous side effects such as bleeding, close monitoring of the degree of anticoagulation is required by a blood test measuring an [[prothrombin time|INR]].  During the initial stage of treatment, INR is checked daily; intervals between tests can be lengthened if the patient manages stable therapeutic INR levels on an unchanged warfarin dose.<ref name=Hirsh/> Newer [[point-of-care testing]] is available and has increased the ease of INR testing in the outpatient setting. Instead of a blood draw, the point of care test involves a simple finger prick.<ref name="Perry 2010">{{cite journal|last=Perry|first=DJ|title=Point-of-care testing in haemostasis|journal=Br J Haematol|date=2010|volume=150|issue=5|pages=501–14|pmid=20618331|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2141.2010.08223.x}}</ref>

When initiating warfarin therapy ("warfarinization"), the doctor will decide how strong the anticoagulant therapy needs to be. The target INR level varies from case to case depending on the clinical indicators, but tends to be 2–3 in most conditions. In particular, target INR may be 2.5–3.5 (or even 3.0–4.5) in patients with one or more [[artificial heart valve#Mechanical valves|mechanical heart valve]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Baglin TP, Keeling DM, Watson HG |title=Guidelines on oral anticoagulation (warfarin): third edition—2005 update |journal=Br. J. Haematol. |volume=132 |issue=3 |pages=277–85 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16409292 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05856.x |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06379.x}}</ref>

In addition, for the first three days of "warfarinization", the levels of protein C and protein S (anticoagulation factors) drop faster than procoagulation proteins such as factor II, VII, IX, and X. Therefore, bridging anticoagulant therapies (usually heparin) are often used to reverse this temporary hypercoagulable state.

====Maintenance dose====
[[File:Theuraputic window.png|thumb|Vitamin K1-warfarin interaction effect. When warfarin levels are high, people have more risk of bleeding. Conversely, lower levels of warfarin lead to increased risk of blood clots. There is a narrow range where the benefits of warfarin are greater than the risks, its [[therapeutic window]]. Certain drugs, herbal medicines and foods can interact with warfarin, increasing or decreasing a previously stable warfarin level.<ref>{{cite web|last=National Institutes of Health|title=important information to know when you are taking : Coumadine and vitamine K|url=http://ods.od.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/coumadin1.pdf|accessdate=27 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020203725/http://ods.od.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/coumadin1.pdf|archivedate=20 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>]]
Recommendations by many national bodies, including the [[American College of Chest Physicians]],<ref name=Holbrook2012>{{cite journal|last=Holbrook|title=Evidence-based management of anticoagulant therapy: Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines.|journal=Chest| year=2012 | volume=141 | issue=2 Suppl | pages=e152S–84S | pmid=22315259|url=http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/article.aspx?articleid=1159453 | pmc=3278055 | doi=10.1378/chest.11-2295|display-authors=etal}}</ref> have been distilled to help manage dose adjustments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20050515/pocform.html |title=Point-of-Care Guides: May&nbsp;15, 2005.

The [[maintenance dose]] of warfarin can fluctuate significantly depending on the amount of vitamin K<sub>1</sub> in the diet. Keeping vitamin K<sub>1</sub> intake at a stable level can prevent these fluctuations. Leafy green vegetables tend to contain higher amounts of vitamin K<sub>1</sub>. Green parts of members of the family [[Apiaceae]], such as [[parsley]], [[cilantro]], and [[dill]], are extremely rich sources of vitamin K; [[cruciferous vegetables]] such as [[cabbage]] and [[broccoli]], as well as the darker varieties of lettuces and other leafy greens, are also relatively high in vitamin K<sub>1</sub>. Green vegetables such a peas and green beans do not have such high amounts of vitamin K<sub>1</sub> as leafy greens. Certain vegetable oils have high amounts of vitamin K<sub>1</sub>.  Foods low in vitamin K<sub>1</sub> include roots, bulbs, tubers, and most fruits and fruit juices. Cereals, grains and other milled products are also low in vitamin K<sub>1</sub>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/warfarin/AN00455|title=Warfarin diet: What foods should I avoid?|publisher=Mayoclinic.com|accessdate=9 August 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824075323/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/warfarin/AN00455|archivedate=24 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

====Self-testing====
{{Main article|INR self-monitoring}}
Patients are making increasing use of self-testing and home monitoring of oral anticoagulation. International guidelines on home testing were published in 2005.<ref name="Ansell2005">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ansell J, Jacobson A, Levy J, Völler H, Hasenkam JM |title=Guidelines for implementation of patient self-testing and patient self-management of oral anticoagulation.

==Contraindications==
All anticoagulants are generally contraindicated in situations where the reduction in clotting that they cause might lead to serious and potentially life-threatening bleeds. This includes people with active bleeding conditions (such as gastrointestinal ulcers), or disease states with increased risk of bleeding e.g. low platelets, severe liver disease, uncontrolled hypertension. For patients undergoing surgery, treatment with anticoagulants is generally suspended. Similarly, spinal or lumbar puncture (e.g. spinal injections, epidurals, etc.) carry increased risk so treatment is suspended prior to these procedures.<ref name="martindale">Brayfield A (ed), Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference [online] London: Pharmaceutical Press [accessed on 24 April 2017]</ref><ref name=FDA2015>{{cite web|title=Coumadin|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2015/009218s115lbl.pdf|website=fda.gov|accessdate=24 April 2017|date=October 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623024610/https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2015/009218s115lbl.pdf|archivedate=23 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Warfarin should not be given to people with [[heparin-induced thrombocytopenia]] until platelet count has improved or normalised.<ref name="martindale" /> Warfarin is usually best avoided in people with protein C or protein S deficiency as these [[thrombophilia|thrombophilic]] conditions increase the risk of skin necrosis, which is a rare but serious side effect associated with warfarin.<ref name="rapini">{{cite book|last1=Bolognia|first1=edited by Jean L.|last2=Jorizzo|first2=Joseph L.|last3=associate|first3=Ronald P.

===Pregnancy===
{{further information|Anticoagulation in pregnancy}}
Warfarin is [[contraindication|contraindicated]] in pregnancy, as it passes through the [[placenta]]l barrier and may cause bleeding in the fetus; warfarin use during pregnancy is commonly associated with [[miscarriage|spontaneous abortion]], [[stillbirth]], [[perinatal mortality#Neonatal mortality|neonatal death]], and [[preterm birth]].<ref name=HDT>{{cite book |author1=Macina, Orest T. |author2=Schardein, James L. |title=Human Developmental Toxicants |publisher=CRC Taylor & Francis |chapter=Warfarin |location=Boca Raton|year=2007|pages=193–4|isbn=0-8493-7229-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8_Lc58cGZj0C}} Retrieved on 15 December 2008 through [[Google Book Search]].</ref> Coumarins (such as warfarin) are also [[teratogen]]s, that is, they cause [[birth defect]]s; the incidence of birth defects in infants exposed to warfarin ''[[in utero]]'' appears to be around 5%, although higher figures (up to 30%) have been reported in some studies.<ref name=Loftus>{{cite book |author=Loftus, Christopher M. |title=Neurosurgical Aspects of Pregnancy |chapter=Fetal toxicity of common neurosurgical drugs |publisher=American Association of Neurological Surgeons |location=Park Ridge, Ill|year=1995|pages=11–3 |isbn=1-879284-36-7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=X58R5BqtHmEC}}</ref> Depending on when exposure occurs during pregnancy, two distinct combinations of congenital abnormalities can arise.<ref name=HDT/>

====First trimester of pregnancy====
Usually, warfarin is avoided in the first trimester, and a [[low molecular weight heparin]] such as [[enoxaparin]] is substituted. With heparin, risk of maternal haemorrhage and other complications are still increased, but heparins do not cross the placental barrier, so do not cause birth defects.<ref name=Loftus/> Various solutions exist for the time around delivery.

When warfarin (or another 4-hydroxycoumarin derivative) is given during the first trimester—particularly between the sixth and ninth weeks of pregnancy—a constellation of birth defects known variously as [[fetal warfarin syndrome]] (FWS), warfarin embryopathy, or coumarin embryopathy can occur. FWS is characterized mainly by [[skeletal]] abnormalities, which include nasal [[hypoplasia]], a depressed or narrowed [[nasal bridge]], [[scoliosis]], and [[calcification]]s in the [[vertebral column]], [[femur]], and [[calcaneus|heel bone]], which show a peculiar stippled appearance on [[medical radiography|X-rays]]. [[Dysmelia|Limb abnormalities]], such as [[brachydactyly]] (unusually short fingers and toes) or underdeveloped extremities, can also occur.<ref name=HDT/><ref name=Loftus/> Common nonskeletal features of FWS include [[low birth weight]] and [[developmental disability|developmental disabilities]].<ref name=HDT/><ref name=Loftus/>

====Second trimester and later====
Warfarin administration in the second and third trimesters is much less commonly associated with birth defects, and when they do occur, are considerably different from fetal warfarin syndrome. The most common congenital abnormalities associated with warfarin use in late pregnancy are [[central nervous system]] disorders, including [[spasticity]] and [[seizure]]s, and eye defects.<ref name=HDT/><ref name=Loftus/> Because of such later pregnancy birth defects, anticoagulation with warfarin poses a problem in pregnant women requiring warfarin for vital indications, such as stroke prevention in those with artificial heart valves.

According to the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP), warfarin may be used in lactating women who wish to breast-feed their infants.<ref name="Bates 2012">{{cite journal|last=Bates|first=SM|title=VTE, thrombophilia, antithrombotic therapy, and pregnancy: Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines.|journal=Chest|date=2012|pmid=22315276|doi=10.1378/chest.11-2300|pmc=3278054|volume=141|issue=2 Suppl|pages=e691S–736S}}</ref>  Available data does not suggest that warfarin crosses into the breast milk.

==Adverse effects==

===Bleeding===
The only common [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]] of warfarin is [[hemorrhage|bleeding]]. The risk of severe bleeding is small but definite (a typically yearly rate of 1-3% has been reported)<ref name=Holbrook2012/> and any benefit needs to outweigh this risk when warfarin is considered. All types of bleeding occur more commonly, but the most severe ones are those involving the brain (intracerebral hemorrhage/hemorrhagic stroke) and the [[spinal cord]].<ref name=Holbrook2012/> Risk of bleeding is increased if the INR is out of range (due to accidental or deliberate overdose or due to interactions).<ref name=Garcia2010>{{cite journal |vauthors=Garcia D, Crowther MA, Ageno W | title=Practical management of coagulopathy associated with warfarin | journal=BMJ | year=2010 | volume=340 | pages=c1813 | doi=10.1136/bmj.c1813 | pmid= 20404060}}</ref> This risk increases greatly once the INR exceeds 4.5.<ref name=Brown2015>{{cite journal|vauthors=Brown DG, Wilkerson EC, Love WE | title=A review of traditional and novel oral anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy for dermatologists and dermatologic surgeons|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology|volume=72|issue=3|pages=524–34|date=March 2015|pmid=25486915|doi= 10.1016/j.jaad.2014.10.027}}</ref>

A number of risk scores exist to predict bleeding in people using warfarin and similar anticoagulants. A commonly used score ([[HAS-BLED]]) includes known predictors of warfarin-related bleeding: uncontrolled high blood pressure (H), abnormal [[renal function|kidney function]] (A), previous stroke (S), known previous bleeding condition (B), previous labile INR when on anticoagulation (L), elderly as defined by age over 65 (E), and drugs associated with bleeding (e.g. aspirin) or alcohol misuse (D).

===Warfarin necrosis===
{{Main article|warfarin necrosis}}
A rare but serious complication resulting from treatment with warfarin is [[warfarin necrosis]], which occurs more frequently shortly after commencing treatment in patients with a deficiency of [[protein C]]. Protein C is an innate anticoagulant that, like the procoagulant factors that warfarin inhibits, requires vitamin K-dependent carboxylation for its activity. Since warfarin initially decreases protein C levels faster than the coagulation factors, it can paradoxically increase the blood's tendency to coagulate when treatment is first begun (many patients when starting on warfarin are given [[heparin]] in parallel to combat this), leading to massive thrombosis with skin [[necrosis]] and [[gangrene]] of limbs. Its natural counterpart, [[purpura fulminans]], occurs in children who are [[homozygous]] for certain protein C mutations.<ref name="pmid10718793">{{cite journal |vauthors=Chan YC, Valenti D, Mansfield AO, Stansby G |title=Warfarin induced skin necrosis |journal=Br J Surg |volume=87 |issue=3 |pages=266–72 |year=2000|pmid=10718793|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2168.2000.01352.x}}</ref>

===Osteoporosis===
After initial reports that warfarin could reduce [[bone mineral density]], several studies have demonstrated a link between warfarin use and [[osteoporosis]]-related [[bone fracture|fracture]]. A 1999 study in 572 women taking warfarin for [[Deep vein thrombosis|deep venous thrombosis]], risk of [[Vertebral compression fracture|vertebral fracture]] and [[rib fracture]] was increased; other fracture types did not occur more commonly.<ref name="pmid10448778">{{cite journal |vauthors=Caraballo PJ, Heit JA, Atkinson EJ, Silverstein MD, O'Fallon WM, Castro MR, Melton LJ | title = Long-term use of oral anticoagulants and the risk of fracture | journal = Arch.

A 2006 retrospective study of 14,564 Medicare recipients showed that warfarin use for more than one year was linked with a 60% increased risk of osteoporosis-related fracture in men; there was no association in women. The mechanism was thought to be a combination of reduced intake of vitamin K, which is necessary for bone health, and inhibition by warfarin of vitamin K-mediated carboxylation of certain bone proteins, rendering them nonfunctional.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gage BF, Birman-Deych E, Radford MJ, Nilasena DS, Binder EF |title=Risk of osteoporotic fracture in elderly patients taking warfarin: results from the National Registry of Atrial Fibrillation 2 |journal=Arch.

===Purple toe syndrome===
Another rare complication that may occur early during warfarin treatment (usually within 3 to 8 weeks of commencement) is ''[[cholesterol embolism|purple toe syndrome]]''. This condition is thought to result from small deposits of [[cholesterol]] breaking loose and causing embolisms in blood vessels in the skin of the feet, which causes a blueish purple colour and may be painful.

It is typically thought to affect the big toe, but it affects other parts of the feet as well, including the bottom of the foot (plantar surface). The occurrence of purple toe syndrome may require discontinuation of warfarin.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Talmadge DB, Spyropoulos AC |title=Purple toes syndrome associated with warfarin therapy in a patient with antiphospholipid syndrome|journal=Pharmacotherapy |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=674–7 |year=2003 |pmid=12741443 |doi=10.1592/phco.23.5.674.32200}}</ref>

===Calcification===
Several studies have also implicated warfarin use in valvular and vascular calcification. No specific treatment is available, but some modalities are under investigation.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Palaniswamy C, Sekhri A, Aronow WS, Kalra A, Peterson SJ|title=Association of warfarin use with valvular and vascular calcification: a review|journal=Clin Cardiol|volume=34|issue=2|pages=74–81|date=February 2011|pmid=21298649|doi=10.1002/clc.20865|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/clc.20865/full|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305095658/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/clc.20865/full|archivedate=5 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Overdose==
{{anchor|Overdose|Reversal}}
The major side effect of warfarin use is bleeding. Risk of bleeding is increased if the [[International normalized ratio|INR]] is out of range (due to accidental or deliberate overdose or due to interactions).<ref name=Garcia2010/> Many drug interactions can increase the effect of warfarin, also causing an overdose.<ref name=Holbrook2005/>

For people who need rapid reversal of warfarin such as due to serious bleeding or need emergency surgery, the effects of warfarin can be reversed with [[vitamin K]], [[prothrombin complex concentrate]] (PCC), or [[fresh frozen plasma]] (FFP) in addition to [[intravenous therapy|intravenous]] vitamin K. Blood products should not be routinely used to reverse warfarin overdose when vitamin K could work alone.<ref name=Ag2012/> PCC has been found to be better than FFP when rapid reversal is needed.<ref name=Chai2016>{{cite journal|last1=Chai-Adisaksopha|first1=C|last2=Hillis|first2=C|last3=Siegal|first3=DM|last4=Movilla|first4=R|last5=Heddle|first5=N|last6=Iorio|first6=A|last7=Crowther|first7=M|title=Prothrombin complex concentrates versus fresh frozen plasma for warfarin reversal.

Details on reversing warfarin are provided in [[clinical practice guidelines]] from the [[American College of Chest Physicians]].<ref name="Ansell">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ansell J, Hirsh J, Hylek E, etal | title=Pharmacology and management of the vitamin K antagonists: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th Edition) | journal=Chest | year= 2008 | volume= 133 | issue= 6 Suppl | pages= 160S–198S |pmid=18574265| doi=10.1378/chest.08-0670 | url=http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/article.aspx?articleid=1085927 }}</ref> For people with an [[international normalized ratio]] (INR) between 4.5 and 10.0, a small dose (about 1000 mcg = one milligram) of oral vitamin K is sufficient.

==Interactions==
Warfarin [[drug interaction|interact]]s with many commonly used drugs, and the [[drug metabolism|metabolism]] of warfarin varies greatly between patients.<ref name=Holbrook2005/> Some foods have also been reported to interact with warfarin.<ref name=Holbrook2005/> Apart from the metabolic interactions, highly protein bound drugs can displace warfarin from [[serum albumin]] and cause an increase in the INR.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gage BF, Fihn SD, White RH |title=Management and dosing of warfarin therapy |journal=Am. J. Med. |volume=109 |issue=6 |pages=481–8 |date=October 2000 |pmid=11042238|doi=10.1016/S0002-9343(00)00545-3}}</ref> This makes finding the correct dosage difficult, and accentuates the need of monitoring; when initiating a medication that is known to interact with warfarin (e.g. [[simvastatin]]), [[international normalized ratio|INR]] checks are increased or dosages adjusted until a new ideal dosage is found.

When taken with NSAIDS (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications), warfarin increases the risk for gastrointestinal bleeding. This increased risk is due to the anti-platelet effect of NSAIDS as well as the possible damage to the gastrointestinal mucosa.<ref>[http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0315/p1745.html#sec-1 Clinically Significant Drug Interactions - American Family Physician<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507065339/http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0315/p1745.html |date=7 May 2016 }}</ref>

Many commonly used antibiotics, such as [[metronidazole]] or the [[macrolide]]s, will greatly increase the effect of warfarin by reducing the [[drug metabolism|metabolism]] of warfarin in the body. Other [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]]s can reduce the amount of the normal [[gut flora|bacterial flora in the bowel]], which make significant quantities of vitamin K<sub>1</sub>, thus potentiating the effect of warfarin.<ref name=Juurlink>{{cite journal |author=Juurlink DN |title=Drug interactions with warfarin: what clinicians need to know |journal=CMAJ |volume=177 |issue=4 |pages=369–71 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17698826 |pmc=1942100 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.070946 |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/177/4/369 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610213120/http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/177/4/369 |archivedate=10 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In addition, food that contains large quantities of vitamin K<sub>1</sub> will reduce the warfarin effect.<ref name=Holbrook2005/><ref name=Holbrook2012/> [[Thyroid]] activity also appears to influence warfarin dosing requirements;<ref name=Kurnik>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kurnik D, Loebstein R, Farfel Z, Ezra D, Halkin H, Olchovsky D |title=Complex drug-drug-disease interactions between amiodarone, warfarin, and the thyroid gland |journal=Medicine (Baltimore) |volume=83 |issue=2|pages=107–13|date=March 2004 |pmid=15028964 |doi= 10.1097/01.md.0000123095.65294.34|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0025-7974&volume=83&issue=2&spage=107}}</ref> [[hypothyroidism]] (decreased thyroid function) makes people less responsive to warfarin treatment,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Stephens MA, Self TH, Lancaster D, Nash T |title=Hypothyroidism: effect on warfarin anticoagulation |journal=South Med J |volume=82 |issue=12 |pages=1585–6|date=December 1989 |pmid=2595433 |doi= 10.1097/00007611-198912000-00035|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0038-4348&volume=82&issue=12&spage=1585}}</ref> while [[hyperthyroidism]] (overactive thyroid) boosts the anticoagulant effect.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chute JP, Ryan CP, Sladek G, Shakir KM |title=Exacerbation of warfarin-induced anticoagulation by hyperthyroidism |journal=Endocr Pract |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=77–9 |year=1997 |pmid=15251480 |url=http://aace.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&issn=1530-891X&volume=3&issue=2&spage=77 |doi=10.4158/EP.3.2.77 |last2=Ryan |last3=Sladek |last4=Shakir }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=Level C |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Several mechanisms have been proposed for this effect, including changes in the rate of breakdown of clotting factors and changes in the metabolism of warfarin.<ref name=Kurnik/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kellett HA, Sawers JS, Boulton FE, Cholerton S, Park BK, Toft AD |title=Problems of anticoagulation with warfarin in hyperthyroidism |journal=Q J Med|volume=58|issue=225 |pages=43–51 |date=January 1986 |pmid=3704105 |url=http://qjmed.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=3704105}}</ref>

Warfarin consists of a [[racemic]] mixture of two active [[enantiomer]]s—''R''- and ''S''- forms—each of which is cleared by different pathways. S-warfarin is 2-5 times more potent than the R-isomer in producing an anticoagulant response.<ref name=Hirsh/> Both the enantiomers of warfarin undergo CYP-mediated metabolism by many different CYPs to form 3',4',6,7,8 and 10-hydroxy warfarin metabolites, major being 7-OH warfarin formed from S-warfarin by CYP2C9 and 10-OH warfarin from R-warfarin by CYP3A4.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Abdul Naveed Shaik |author2=Grater Richard |author3=Lulla Mukesh |author4=Williams David A. |author5=Gan Lawrence L. |author6=Bohnert Tonika |author7=LeDuc Barbara W. | year = 2016 | title = Comparison of enzyme kinetics of warfarin analyzed by LC–MS/MS QTrap and differential mobility spectrometry | url = | journal = Journal of Chromatography B | volume = 1008 | issue = 1| pages = 164–173 | doi = 10.1016/j.jchromb.2015.11.036 | PMID= 26655108 }}</ref>

Warfarin is more slowly acting than the common anticoagulant [[heparin]], though it has a number of advantages. Heparin must be given by injection, whereas warfarin is available orally. Warfarin has a long half-life and need only be given once a day. Heparin can also cause a prothrombotic condition, [[heparin-induced thrombocytopenia]] (an antibody-mediated decrease in [[platelet]] levels), which increases the risk for [[thrombosis]]. It takes several days for warfarin to reach the therapeutic effect since the circulating coagulation factors are not affected by the drug (thrombin has a half-life time of days). Warfarin's long half-life means that it remains effective for several days after it was stopped.  Furthermore, if given initially without additional anticoagulant cover, it can increase thrombosis risk (see below). For these main reasons, hospitalised patients are usually given heparin with warfarin initially, the heparin covering the 3–5 day lag period and being withdrawn after a few days.

===Mechanism of action===
While warfarin is one of several drugs popularly referred to as a "blood thinner;" this is a misnomer since it does not affect the [[viscosity]] of blood.

Warfarin inhibits the [[vitamin K]]-dependent synthesis of biologically active forms of the [[calcium]]-dependent [[clotting]] factors [[thrombin|II]], [[factor VII|VII]], [[factor IX|IX]] and [[factor X|X]], as well as the regulatory factors [[protein C]], [[protein S]], and [[protein Z]].<ref name="Ansell"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Freedman MD |title=Oral anticoagulants: pharmacodynamics, clinical indications and adverse effects |journal=J Clin Pharmacol |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=196–209 |date=March 1992|pmid=1564123|doi=10.1002/j.1552-4604.1992.tb03827.x}}</ref> Other proteins not involved in blood clotting, such as [[osteocalcin]], or [[matrix gla protein|matrix Gla protein]], may also be affected.
The precursors of these factors require [[gamma carboxylation]] of their [[glutamic acid]] residues to allow the coagulation factors to bind to [[phospholipid]] surfaces inside blood vessels, on the vascular [[endothelium]]. The enzyme that carries out the carboxylation of glutamic acid is [[gamma-glutamyl carboxylase]]. The carboxylation reaction will proceed only if the carboxylase enzyme is able to convert a [[reduction (chemistry)|reduced]] form of vitamin K (vitamin K hydroquinone) to vitamin K epoxide at the same time. The vitamin K epoxide is in turn recycled back to vitamin K and vitamin K hydroquinone by another enzyme, the [[vitamin K epoxide reductase]] (VKOR). Warfarin inhibits epoxide reductase<ref name=Whitlon>{{cite journal |vauthors=Whitlon DS, Sadowski JA, Suttie JW |title=Mechanism of coumarin action: significance of vitamin K epoxide reductase inhibition |journal=Biochemistry |volume=17 |issue=8 |pages=1371–7|year=1978|pmid=646989|doi=10.1021/bi00601a003}}</ref> (specifically the VKORC1 subunit<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Li T, Chang CY, Jin DY, Lin PJ, Khvorova A, Stafford DW |title=Identification of the gene for vitamin K epoxide reductase |journal=Nature |volume=427|issue=6974|pages=541–4 |year=2004 |pmid=14765195 |doi=10.1038/nature02254}}</ref><ref name="pmid14765194">{{cite journal |vauthors=Rost S, Fregin A, Ivaskevicius V, Conzelmann E, Hörtnagel K, Pelz HJ, Lappegard K, Seifried E, Scharrer I, Tuddenham EG, Müller CR, Strom TM, Oldenburg J | title = Mutations in VKORC1 cause warfarin resistance and multiple coagulation factor deficiency type 2 | journal = Nature | volume = 427 | issue = 6974 | pages = 537–41 |date=February 2004 | pmid = 14765194 | doi = 10.1038/nature02214  }}</ref>), thereby diminishing available vitamin K and vitamin K hydroquinone in the tissues, which inhibits the carboxylation activity of the glutamyl carboxylase. When this occurs, the coagulation factors are no longer carboxylated at certain [[glutamic acid]] residues, and are incapable of binding to the [[endothelial]] surface of blood vessels, and are thus biologically inactive. As the body's stores of previously produced active factors degrade (over several days) and are replaced by inactive factors, the anticoagulation effect becomes apparent. The coagulation factors are produced, but have decreased functionality due to undercarboxylation; they are collectively referred to as PIVKAs (proteins induced [by] vitamin K absence/antagonism), and individual coagulation factors as PIVKA-''number'' (e.g.[[Des-gamma carboxyprothrombin|PIVKA-II]]). The end result of warfarin use, therefore, is to diminish blood clotting in the patient.

When warfarin is newly started, it may ''promote'' clot formation temporarily. This is because the level of [[protein C]] and [[protein S]] are also dependent on vitamin K activity. Warfarin causes decline in protein C levels in first 36 hours. In addition, reduced levels of protein S lead to a reduction in activity of [[protein C]] (for which it is the co-factor) and therefore reduced degradation of [[factor V]]a and [[factor VIII]]a. Although loading doses of warfarin over 5&nbsp;mg also produce a precipitous decline in [[factor VII]], resulting in an initial prolongation of the INR, full antithrombotic effect does not take place until significant reduction in factor II occurs days later. The haemostasis system becomes temporarily biased towards thrombus formation, leading to a prothrombotic state. Thus, when warfarin is loaded rapidly at greater than 5&nbsp;mg per day, it is beneficial to co-administer [[heparin]], an anticoagulant that acts upon [[antithrombin]] and helps reduce the risk of thrombosis, with warfarin therapy for four to five days, in order to have the benefit of anticoagulation from heparin until the full effect of warfarin has been achieved.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Litin SC, Gastineau DA |title=Current concepts in anticoagulant therapy |journal=Mayo Clin.

===Pharmacogenomics===
Warfarin activity is determined partially by genetic factors. [[Polymorphism (biology)|Polymorphism]]s in two genes (''VKORC1'' and ''CYP2C9'') play a particularly large role in response to warfarin.

Despite the promise of pharmacogenomic testing in warfarin dosing, its use in clinical practice is controversial.  In August 2009 the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] concluded that "the available evidence does not demonstrate that pharmacogenomic testing of CYP2C9 or VKORC1 [[allele]]s to predict warfarin responsiveness improves health outcomes in [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] beneficiaries."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/details/nca-decision-memo.aspx?NCAId=224&ver=15&NcaName=Pharmacogenomic+Testing+for+Warfarin+Response&NCDId=333&ncdver=1&IsPopup=y&bc=AAAAAAAAEAAA& |title=Decision Memo for Pharmacogenomic Testing for Warfarin Response (CAG-00400N) |vauthors=Jensen TS, Jacques LB, Ciccanti M, Long K, Eggleston L, Roche J |date=3 August 2009 |publisher=Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services |accessdate=27 March 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126052635/http://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/details/nca-decision-memo.aspx?NCAId=224&ver=15&NcaName=Pharmacogenomic+Testing+for+Warfarin+Response&NCDId=333&ncdver=1&IsPopup=y&bc=AAAAAAAAEAAA& |archivedate=26 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> A 2014 [[meta-analysis]] showed that using genotype-based dosing did not confer benefit in terms of time within therapeutic range, excessive anticoagulation (as defined by INR greater than 4), or a reduction in either [[major bleeding]] or [[Thrombosis|thromboembolic]] events.<ref name=Stergiopoulos>{{cite journal |vauthors=Stergiopoulos K, Brown DL |title=Genotype-Guided vs Clinical Dosing of Warfarin and Its Analogues: Meta-analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials |journal=JAMA Intern Med |volume=174 |issue=8 |pages=1330–1338 |date=August 2014  |pmid=24935087 |doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2014.2368}}</ref>

==History==
In the early 1920s, there was an outbreak of a previously unrecognized cattle disease in the northern United States and Canada. Cattle were [[haemorrhaging]] after minor procedures and on some occasions, spontaneously. For example, 21 out of 22 cows died after dehorning and 12 out of 25 bulls died after castration. All of these animals had bled to death.<ref name="Laurence 1973 23.4-23.5">{{cite book|title=Clinical Pharmacology |last=Laurence |first=D.R. |others=Peter Kneebone |year=1973 |publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Edinburgh, London and New York |pages=23.4–23.5 |isbn=0-443-04990-4}}</ref>

In 1921, [[Frank Schofield]], a Canadian [[veterinary]] [[pathologist]], determined that the cattle were ingesting moldy [[silage]] made from [[sweet clover]], and that this was functioning as a potent anticoagulant. Only spoiled hay made from sweet clover (grown in northern states of the USA and in Canada since the turn of the century) produced the disease.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Schofield FW|title=Damaged sweet clover; the cause of a new disease in cattle simulating haemorrhagic septicemia and blackleg|journal=J Am Vet Med Assoc|year=1924|volume=64|pages=553–6}}</ref> Schofield separated good clover stalks and damaged clover stalks from the same hay mow, and fed each to a different rabbit. The rabbit that had ingested the good stalks remained well, but the rabbit that had ingested the damaged stalks died from a haemorrhagic illness. A duplicate experiment with a different sample of clover hay produced the same result.<ref name="Laurence 1973 23.4-23.5"/> In 1929, North Dakota veterinarian Dr L.M. Roderick demonstrated that the condition was due to a lack of functioning [[prothrombin]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Roderick LM|year=1931|title=A problem in the coagulation of the blood; "sweet clover disease of the cattle"|journal=Am J Physiol |volume=96|pages=413–6}}[http://ajplegacy.physiology.org/cgi/reprint/96/2/413 PDF (subscriber only)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013150832/http://ajplegacy.physiology.org/cgi/reprint/96/2/413 |date=13 October 2007 }}.</ref>

The identity of the anticoagulant substance in spoiled sweet clover remained a mystery until 1940. In 1933 [[Karl Paul Link]] and his lab of chemists working at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]] set out to isolate and characterize the haemorrhagic agent from the spoiled hay. It took five years for Link's student Harold A. Campbell to recover 6&nbsp;mg of crystalline anticoagulant. Next, Link's student Mark A. Stahmann took over the project and initiated a large-scale extraction, isolating 1.8 g of recrystallized anticoagulant in about 4 months. This was enough material for Stahmann and Charles F. Huebner to check their results against Campbell's and to thoroughly characterize the compound. Through degradation experiments they established that the anticoagulant was 3,3'-methylenebis-(4-hydroxycoumarin), which they later named [[dicoumarol]]. They confirmed their results by synthesizing dicoumarol and proving in 1940 that it was identical to the naturally occurring agent.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Stahmann MA, Huebner CF, Link KP|date=1 April 1941|title=Studies on the hemorrhagic sweet clover disease. V. Identification and synthesis of the hemorrhagic agent|journal=J Biol Chem|volume=138|pages=513–27|url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/138/2/513|issue=2|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627063001/http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/138/2/513|archivedate=27 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Dicoumarol was a product of the plant molecule [[coumarin]] (not to be confused with Couma'''d'''in, a later tradename for warfarin). Coumarin is now known to be present in many plants, and produces the notably sweet smell of freshly cut grass or hay and plants like [[Hierochloe odorata|sweet grass]]; in fact, the plant's high content of coumarin is responsible for the original common name of "sweet clover", which is named for its sweet smell, not its bitter taste.<ref name="Laurence 1973 23.4-23.5"/> They are present notably in [[Galium odoratum|woodruff]] (''Galium odoratum'', [[Rubiaceae]]), and at lower levels in [[licorice]], [[lavender]], and various other species. However, coumarins themselves do not influence clotting or warfarin-like action, but must first be metabolized by various fungi into compounds such as [[4-hydroxycoumarin]], then further (in the presence of naturally occurring [[formaldehyde]]) into [[dicoumarol]], in order to have any anticoagulant properties. Fungal attack of the damaged and dying clover stalks explained the presence of the anticoagulant only in spoiled clover silages; dicoumarol is considered to be a fermentation product and [[mycotoxin]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Bye A. |author2=King H.

Over the next few years, numerous similar chemicals (specifically 4-hydroxycoumarins with a large [[aromatic]] substitutent at the '''3''' position) were found to have the same anticoagulant properties. The first drug in the class to be widely commercialized was [[dicoumarol]] itself, patented in 1941 and later used as a pharmaceutical. Karl Link continued working on developing more potent coumarin-based anticoagulants for use as [[rodenticide|rodent poisons]], resulting in warfarin in 1948. The name "warfarin" stems from the acronym ''WARF'', for ''[[Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation]]'' + the ending ''-arin'' indicating its link with coumarin. Warfarin was first registered for use as a rodenticide in the US in 1948, and was immediately popular. Although warfarin was developed by Link, the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation financially supported the research and was assigned the patent.<ref name="pmid13619027">{{cite journal |author=Link KP |title=The discovery of dicumarol and its sequels |journal=Circulation |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=97–107 |date=1 January 1959 |pmid=13619027 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/19/1/97 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.19.1.97 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704011549/http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/19/1/97 |archivedate=4 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

After an incident in 1951, where a [[United States Army|US Army]] inductee attempted suicide with multiple doses of warfarin in rodenticide but recovered fully after presenting to a hospital and being treated with vitamin K (by then known as a specific antidote),<ref name="pmid13619027"/> studies began in the use of warfarin as a therapeutic anticoagulant. It was found to be generally superior to dicoumarol, and in 1954 was approved for medical use in humans. An early recipient of warfarin was US president [[Dwight Eisenhower]], who was prescribed the drug after having a heart attack in 1955.<ref name="pmid13619027"/>

The exact [[mechanism of action]] remained unknown until it was demonstrated, in 1978, that warfarin [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibits]] the enzyme [[Vitamin K epoxide reductase|epoxide reductase]] and hence interferes with vitamin K metabolism.<ref name=Whitlon />

It has been posited that [[Lavrenty Beria]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and others conspired to use warfarin to poison Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]]. Warfarin is tasteless and colourless, and produces symptoms similar to those that Stalin exhibited.<!--when?

Coumarins (4-hydroxycoumarin derivatives) are used as [[rodenticide]]s for controlling [[rat]]s and [[mouse|mice]] in residential, industrial, and agricultural areas. Warfarin is both odorless and tasteless, and is effective when mixed with food [[bait (luring substance)|bait]], because the [[rodent]]s will return to the bait and continue to feed over a period of days until a lethal dose is accumulated (considered to be 1&nbsp;mg/kg/day over about six days). It may also be mixed with [[talc]] and used as a ''tracking powder'', which accumulates on the animal's skin and fur, and is subsequently consumed during grooming. The {{LD50}} is 50–500&nbsp;mg/kg.

The use of warfarin itself as a rat poison is now declining, because many rat populations have developed resistance to it, and poisons of considerably greater potency are now available. Other 4-hydroxycoumarins used as rodenticides include [[coumatetralyl]] and [[brodifacoum]], which is sometimes referred to as "super-warfarin", because it is more potent, longer-acting, and effective even in rat and mouse populations that are resistant to warfarin.

==Names==
Warfarin is a derivative of [[dicoumarol]], an anticoagulant originally discovered in spoiled [[sweet clover]]. Dicoumarol, in turn, is from [[coumarin]], a sweet-smelling but coagulation-inactive chemical found in "sweet" clover and [[Dipteryx odorata|tonka beans]] (also known as ''cumaru'' from which coumarin's name derives). The name ''warfarin'' stems from its discovery at the [[University of Wisconsin]], incorporating the acronym for the organization that funded the key research, ''WARF'' for the [[Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation]] and the ending ''-arin'', indicating its link with coumarin.

The drug is marketed under many brand and generic names including Aldocumar, Anasmol, Anticoag, Befarin, Cavamed, Cicoxil, Circuvit, Cofarin, Coumadin, Coumadine, Cumar, Farin, Foley, Haemofarin, Jantoven, Kovar, Lawarin, Maforan, Marevan, Marfarin, Marivanil, Martefarin, Morfarin, Orfarin, Panwarfin, Scheme, Simarc, Varfarin, Varfarins, Varfine, Waran, Warcok, Warf, Warfareks, Warfarin, Warfarina, Warfarine, Warfarinum, Warfen, Warfin, Warik, Warin, Warlin, and Zyfarin.<ref name=brands>{{cite web|title=Warfarin international brands|url=https://www.drugs.com/international/warfarin.html|publisher=Drugs.com|accessdate=4 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405172058/https://www.drugs.com/international/warfarin.html|archivedate=5 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
