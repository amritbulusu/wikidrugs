'''Methohexital''' or '''methohexitone''' (marketed under the brand names '''Brevital''' and '''Brietal''') is a drug which is a [[barbiturate]] derivative. It is classified as short-acting, and has a rapid onset of action. It is similar in its effects to [[sodium thiopental]], a drug with which it competed in the market for [[anaesthetics]].

==Pharmacology==
Methohexital binds to a distinct site which is associated with Cl<sup>−</sup> [[ionophore]]s at GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors.<ref>Katzung, Bertram G., Basic and Clinical Pharmacology, 10th ed., p. 406-407</ref> This increases the length of time which the Cl<sup>−</sup> ionopores are open, thus causing an [[Inhibitory postsynaptic potential|inhibitory]] effect.

Metabolism of methohexital is primarily hepatic (i.e., taking place in the liver) via demethylation and oxidation.{{citation needed|date=November 2008}} Side-chain oxidation is the primary means of metabolism involved in the termination of the drug's biological activity.

Protein binding is approximately 73% for methohexital.{{citation needed|date=November 2008}}

==Indications==
Methohexital is primarily used to induce [[anesthesia]], and is generally provided as a sodium salt (i.e. methohexital sodium). It is only used in [[hospital]] or similar settings, under strict supervision.{{citation needed|date=November 2008}}  It has been commonly used to induce deep sedation or general anesthesia for surgery and dental procedures.  Unlike many other barbiturates, Methohexital actually lowers the seizure threshold, a property that make it particularly useful when anesthesia is provided for a [[electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT). And rapid recovery rate with consciousness being gained within three to seven minutes after induction and full recovery within 30 minutes is a major advantage over other ECT barbiturates (Schulgasser and Borowitz 1963).

==Synthesis==
Methohexital, 5-allyl-1-methyl-5-(1-methyl-2-pentinyl barbituric acid, is synthesized in the classic manner of making barbituric acid derivatives, in particular by the reaction of malonic ester derivatives with derivatives of [[urea]]. 
[[File:Methohexital synthesis.png|800px|center|thumb|Methohexital synthesis: W.J. Doran, {{US Patent|2872448}} (1959).]]
The resulting allyl-(1-methyl-2-pentynyl) malonic ester is synthesized by subsequent alkylation of the malonic ester itself, beginning with 2-bromo-3-hexyne, which gives (1-methyl-2-pentynyl)malonic ester, and then by allylbromide. In the final step, reaction of the disubstituted malonic ester with N-methylurea gives desired methohexital.
