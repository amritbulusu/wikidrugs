== Medical uses ==
Pyrazinamide is only used in combination with other drugs such as [[isoniazid]] and [[rifampicin]] in the [[Tuberculosis treatment|treatment]] of ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''. It is never used on its own.  It has no other [[Indication (medicine)|indicated medical uses]]. In particular, it is not used to treat other [[mycobacteria]]; ''[[Mycobacterium bovis]]'' and ''[[Mycobacterium leprae]]'' are innately resistant to pyrazinamide.

Pyrazinamide is used in the first two months of treatment to reduce the duration of treatment required.<!--

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Pyrazinamide is well absorbed orally.  It crosses inflamed meninges and is an essential part of the treatment of [[tuberculous meningitis]].  It is metabolised by the [[liver]] and the metabolic products are excreted by the kidneys.

Pyrazinamide is routinely used in pregnancy in the UK and the rest of the world;  the [[World Health Organisation|WHO]] recommend its use in pregnancy; and there is extensive clinical experience to show that it is safe.  In the U.S., pyrazinamide is not used in pregnancy, citing insufficient evidence of safety.<!--

== Mechanism of action ==
Pyrazinamide is a [[prodrug]] that stops the growth of ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''.

=== Resistance ===
Mutations in the ''[[pncA]]'' gene of ''M. tuberculosis'', which encodes a pyrazinamidase and converts pyrazinamide to its active form pyrazinoic acid, are responsible for the majority of pyrazinamide resistance in ''M. tuberculosis'' strains.<ref name="Scorpio1996">{{cite journal |vauthors=Scorpio A, Zhang Y | title=Mutations in pncA, a gene encoding pyrazinamidase/nicotinamidase, cause resistance to the antituberculous drug pyrazinamide in tubercle bacillus | journal=Nature Medicine | year=1996 | volume=2 | pages=662–7 | pmid=8640557 | doi=10.1038/nm0696-662 | issue=6 }}</ref> A few pyrazinamidase resistant strains with mutations in the ''rpsA'' gene have also been identified.<ref name="pmid21835980" /> However, a direct association between these ''rpsA'' mutations and pyrazinamide resistance has not been established.

There are currently three main methods of testing for pyrazinamide resistance: 1) phenotypic tests where a tuberculosis strain is grown in the presence of increasing concentrations of pyrazinamide, 2) measuring levels of pyrazinamidase enzyme produced by the tuberculosis strain, or 3) looking for mutations in the [[pncA]] gene of tuberculosis.<ref name=":0" /> There have been concerns that the most widely used method for phenotypic resistance testing may overestimate the amount of resistant strains.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chedore|first=Pamela|last2=Bertucci|first2=Lina|last3=Wolfe|first3=Joyce|last4=Sharma|first4=Meenu|last5=Jamieson|first5=Frances|date=2010-01-01|title=Potential for Erroneous Results Indicating Resistance When Using the Bactec MGIT 960 System for Testing Susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to Pyrazinamide|url=http://jcm.asm.org/content/48/1/300|journal=Journal of Clinical Microbiology|language=en|volume=48|issue=1|pages=300–301|doi=10.1128/JCM.01775-09|issn=0095-1137|pmc=2812260|pmid=19923479|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910172352/http://jcm.asm.org/content/48/1/300|archivedate=2017-09-10|df=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Piersimoni|first=C.|last2=Mustazzolu|first2=A.|last3=Iacobino|first3=A.|last4=Giannoni|first4=F.|last5=Santoro|first5=G.|last6=Gherardi|first6=G.|last7=Del Giudice|first7=A.|last8=Perna|first8=R.|last9=Fattorini|first9=L.|date=2016-12-01|title=Pyrazinamide susceptibility testing: proposed new standard with the BACTECTM MGITTM 960 system|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/10.5588/ijtld.16.0360|journal=The International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease|volume=20|issue=12|pages=1677–1680|doi=10.5588/ijtld.16.0360}}</ref>

== Abbreviations ==
The abbreviations PZA and Z are standard, and used commonly in the medical literature, although [[best practice]] discourages the abbreviating of drug names to prevent mistakes.

== Presentation ==
Pyrazinamide is a [[generic drug]], and is available in a wide variety of presentations.  Pyrazinamide tablets form the bulkiest part of the standard tuberculosis treatment regimen.  Pyrazinamide tablets are so large, some people find them impossible to swallow: pyrazinamide syrup is an option.

Pyrazinamide is also available as part of fixed-dose combinations with other TB drugs such as [[isoniazid]] and [[rifampicin]] (''[[Rifater]]'' is an example).

== History ==
Pyrazinamide was first discovered and patented in 1936 but not used against tuberculosis until 1952.<ref name="Zhang"/> Its discovery as an anti-tubercular agent was remarkable since it has no activity against tuberculosis [[In vitro|in-vitro]], due to not being active at a neutral pH, so would ordinarily not be expected to work [[In vivo|in-vivo]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Y.|last2=Mitchison|first2=D.|date=2003-01-01|title=The curious characteristics of pyrazinamide: a review|journal=The International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease: The Official Journal of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease|volume=7|issue=1|pages=6–21|issn=1027-3719|pmid=12701830}}</ref> However, it was known that [[nicotinamide]] had activity against tuberculosis and pyrazinamide was thought to have a similar effect. Experiments in mice at [[Lederle Laboratories|Lederle]] and [[Merck & Co.|Merck]] confirmed its ability to kill tuberculosis and it was rapidly used in humans.<ref name=":1" />
