'''Dimethyl fumarate''' (DMF) is the methyl [[ester]] of [[fumaric acid]].

In a non-medical use, DMF was applied as a [[biocide]] in furniture or shoes to prevent growths of [[mold]] during storage or transport in a humid climate. However, due to incidences of allergic reactions after skin contact the [[European Union]] banned DMF in consumer products since 1998, and since January 2009 the import of products containing DMF was also banned.<ref name="EU1">{{cite press release |publisher=European Commission |title=Consumers: EU to ban dimethylfumarate (DMF) in consumer products, such as sofas and shoes |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/09/190&format=PDF&aged=0&language=EN |accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref>

== Medical use ==
Dimethyl fumarate was shown to have a significant effect on relapse rate and time to progression in phase III clinical trials of [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref name="Gold1" /><ref name="Fox1" />

Dimethyl fumarate was recommended for approval in the [[European Union]] as a [[Oral administration|peroral]] treatment for MS by EMA on March 21, 2013.<ref>{{Citation | publication-date= 26 Feb 2014 |title= European Public Assessment Report: Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) |publisher=  European Medicines Agency |url= http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/002601/human_med_001657.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d124}}</ref>

==Side effects==
One serious side effect that has been described is [[progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy]].<ref>{{cite web|title=FDA Drug Safety Communication: FDA warns about case of rare brain infection PML with MS drug Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate)|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm424625.htm|website=fda.gov|accessdate=2 December 2014|date=2014-11-25}}</ref>

== Reactions ==
Dimethyl fumarate is an [[ester]] and an [[Enone|α,β-unsaturated]] electrophilic compound which can quickly undergo [[Michael addition]]s with [[nucleophile]]s. Dimethyl fumarate is also an effective diene acceptor in the thermal [[Diels-Alder reaction]], where the reactivity of its [[Vinylene group|vinylenic]] bond is enhanced by the two electron-withdrawing ester groups. Due to the geometry of the starting ester, the Diels-Alder product will have a ''trans'' configuration. With this reaction, compounds with bicyclo skeletons can be synthesized, e.g. a diester with a [[norbornene]] (bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene) skeleton from dimethyl fumarate and [[cyclopentadiene]].

== Mechanism of action ==
The precise mechanism of action of dimethyl fumarate is unknown. The compound (and its metabolite, monomethyl fumarate) activates the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 ([[Nrf2]]) pathway and has been identified as a [[nicotinic acid]] receptor [[agonist]] in vitro.<ref>{{cite web|title=Highlights of prescribing information|url=https://www.tecfidera.com/pdfs/full-prescribing-information.pdf|publisher=Biogen Idec|accessdate=8 October 2014|date=March 2013}}</ref> Dimethyl fumarate is a [[Lipophilicity|lipophilic]], highly mobile molecule in human tissue. As a [[Enone|α,β-unsaturated]] electrophilic compound, dimethyl fumarate is rapidly attacked by the detoxifying agent [[glutathione]] (GSH) in a [[Michael addition]] reaction.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=6035529 |year=1967 |last1=Boyland |first1=E |last2=Chasseaud |first2=LF |title=Enzyme-catalysed conjugations of glutathione with unsaturated compounds |volume=104 |issue=1 |pages=95–102 |pmc=1270549 |journal=The Biochemical Journal |doi=10.1042/bj1040095}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/tx00047a019 |title=Investigations of Glutathione Conjugation in Vitro by 1H NMR Spectroscopy.

==History==
The American company [[Biogen Idec]] developed DMF as a capsule containing microtablets for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, under the code name BG-12; it was approved, under the trade name Tecfidera, for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of MS on March 27, 2013.<ref>{{cite news|title=Biogen Idec’s TECFIDERA™ (Dimethyl Fumarate) Approved in US as a First-Line Oral Treatment for Multiple Sclerosis|url=http://www.biogenidec.com/press_release_details.aspx?ID=5981&ReqId=1801165|date=Mar 27, 2013|agency=Biogen Idec Press Release}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=FDA approves new multiple sclerosis treatment: Tecfidera|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm345528.htm|accessdate=2013-04-05|date=Mar 27, 2013|agency=FDA}}</ref>

==Consumer products==
Dimethyl fumarate has been found to be an [[allergic sensitizer]] at very low concentrations, producing [[eczema]] that is difficult to treat.
