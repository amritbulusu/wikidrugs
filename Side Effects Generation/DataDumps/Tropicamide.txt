<!-- Definition and medical use -->
'''Tropicamide''', sold under the brand name '''Mydriacyl''' among others, is a medication used to [[mydriatic|dilate the pupil]] and help with [[examination of the eye]].<ref name=AHFS2016/> Specifically it is used to help examine the [[fundus (eye)|back of the eye]].<ref name=WHO2008>{{cite book|title=WHO Model Formulary 2008|date=2009|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=9789241547659|page=314|url=http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/documents/s16879e/s16879e.pdf|accessdate= 8 December 2016}}</ref> It is applied as [[eye drops]].<ref name=AHFS2016/> Effects occur within 40 minutes and lasts for up to a day.<ref name=AHFS2016/>

<!-- Side effects and mechanism -->

== Medical use ==
[[Image:Anizokoria.JPG|thumb|210px|alt=Right eye was instilled with tropicamide, leading to [[mydriasis]] and therefore [[anisocoria]] (unequal pupil size)|[[Anisocoria]] caused by tropicamide instilled into the right eye only.]]
Tropicamide is an [[Muscarinic antagonist|antimuscarinic]] drug that produces short acting [[mydriasis]] (dilation of the [[pupil]]) and [[cycloplegia]]<ref name="pmid11431435">{{cite journal |vauthors=Manny RE, Hussein M, Scheiman M, Kurtz D, Niemann K, Zinzer K |title=Tropicamide (1%): an effective cycloplegic agent for myopic children |journal=Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science |volume=42 |issue=8 |pages=1728–35 |date=July 2001 |pmid=11431435 |doi= |url=http://www.iovs.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11431435}}</ref> when applied as [[eye drop]]s. It is used to allow better examination of the [[lens (anatomy)|lens]], [[vitreous humor]], and [[retina]]. Due to its relatively short duration of effect (4&ndash;8 hours), it is typically used during [[eye examination]]s such as the [[dilated fundus examination]], but it may also be used before or after [[eye surgery]].  Cycloplegic drops are often also used to treat anterior [[uveitis]], decreasing risk of posterior [[Synechia (eye)|synechiae]] and decreasing inflammation in the anterior chamber of the eye.

Tropicamide is occasionally administered in combination with [[p-Hydroxyamphetamine|p-hydroxyamphetamine]] (brand name [[Paremyd]]), which is a [[sympathomimetic]].  The use of the sympathomimetic drug causes the iris dilator muscle to be directly stimulated, causing increased dilation.  In the United States, the sympathomimetic drop most commonly used along with tropicamide, is 2.5% [[phenylephrine]] hydrochloride (brand name AK-Dilate).

== Side effects ==

Tropicamide induces transient stinging and a slight and transient rise in [[intraocular pressure]] in the majority of patients. It may cause redness or [[conjunctivitis]] (inflammation) and also [[Defocus aberration|blurs]] near vision for a short while after instillation (care must be taken, and the patient must only drive when vision returns to normal). Tropicamide may, in very rare cases [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1325111/], cause an attack of [[Glaucoma#Classification|acute angle-closure glaucoma]]. This tends to be in patients with narrow [[anterior chamber]] [[trabecular meshwork|angles]], and closure risk must be assessed by the practitioner prior to instillation.

Tropicamide is often preferred to [[atropine]] because atropine has a longer [[half-life]], causing prolonged dilation and blurry vision for up to a week. Atropine has less sting effect, but can be toxic or fatal if ingested in large quantities by children or adults.

Systemic side effects are very rare.

== Illicit use ==

According to the researchers of the European Commission-funded ReDNet Project, in Russia tropicamide is currently abused (injected intravenously) as an inexpensive recreational [[deliriant]] drug.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2013.04.013| pmid = 23706777| title = Drops of madness?
