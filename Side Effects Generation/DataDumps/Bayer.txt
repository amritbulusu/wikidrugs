'''Bayer AG''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|eɪ|ər}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|aɪ|ər}}); {{IPA-de|ˈbaɪ̯ɐ}}) is a [[Germany|German]] [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[chemical industry|chemical]], [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical]] and [[life sciences]] company. It is headquartered in [[Leverkusen]], where its illuminated sign is a landmark. Bayer's primary areas of business include human and veterinary pharmaceuticals; consumer healthcare products; agricultural chemicals and biotechnology products; and high value [[polymers]]. The company is a component of the [[Euro Stoxx 50]] [[stock market index]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.boerse-frankfurt.de/index/constituents/Euro_Stoxx_50#Constituents|title=Börse Frankfurt (Frankfurt Stock Exchange): Stock market quotes, charts and news|last=<!-- no byline provided -->|first=|date=<!-- date not provided -->|website=|publisher=Deutsche Börse|access-date=2017-01-17}}</ref> The company's [[motto]] is "science for a better life."

Bayer's first and best known product was [[aspirin]]; there is a dispute about what scientist at Bayer made the most important contributions to it, [[Arthur Eichengr&uuml;n]] or [[Felix Hoffmann]]. Bayer [[trademarked]] the name "[[heroin]]" for the drug diacetylmorphine and marketed it as a cough suppressant and non-addictive substitute for morphine from 1898 to 1910. Bayer also introduced [[phenobarbital]], [[prontosil]], the first widely used antibiotic and the subject of the 1939 Nobel Prize in Medicine,  the antibiotic Cipro ([[ciprofloxacin]]), and Yaz ([[drospirenone]]) [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pills]]. In 2014 Bayer bought [[Merck & Co.|MSD]]'s consumer business, with brands such as Claritin, Coppertone and Dr. Scholl's. Its BayerCropscience business develops [[genetically modified crops]] and [[pesticides]]. Its materials science division makes polymers like [[polyurethanes]] and [[polycarbonate]].

Bayer was founded in [[Barmen]] in 1863. It was part of [[IG Farben]], the world's largest chemical and pharmaceutical company, from 1925 to 1952, and then again became an independent company. The company played a key role in the [[Wirtschaftswunder]] during the early [[Cold War]] and quickly regained its position as one of the world's largest chemical and pharmaceutical corporations. Bayer acquired [[Schering AG|Schering]] in 2006 and announced its acquisition of [[Monsanto]] in 2016.

==History==

===Early history===
Bayer AG was founded in [[Barmen]] (today a part of [[Wuppertal]]), Germany in 1863 by [[Friedrich Bayer]] and his partner, Johann Friedrich Weskott.<ref name="bayer1"/>

[[File:Bayer-Kreuz.jpg|thumb|Bayer-Kreuz Leverkusen]]
The company's corporate logo, the ''Bayer cross,'' was introduced in 1904. It consists of the horizontal word "BAYER" crossed with the vertical word "BAYER," both words sharing the "Y", and enclosed in a circle.<ref>Ibis Sánchez-Serrano.

===Aspirin===
Bayer's first major product was [[acetylsalicylic acid]] (originally discovered by French chemist [[Charles Frederic Gerhardt]] in 1853), a modification of [[salicylic acid]] or [[salicin]], a [[folk remedy]] found in the [[bark]] of the [[willow]] plant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nobelprizes.com/nobel/medicine/aspirin.html|title=An aspirin a day keeps the doctor at bay: The world's first blockbuster drug is a hundred years old this week|accessdate=2007-06-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/edwinsmithsurgical.htm|title=The Edwin Smith Papyrus|author=James Breasted (English translation)|accessdate=2007-06-09}}</ref> By 1899, Bayer's trademark [[Aspirin]] was registered worldwide for Bayer's brand of acetylsalicylic acid, but "Aspirin" lost its trademark status in the United States, France, and the United Kingdom because of the confiscation of Bayer's US assets and trademarks during [[World War I]] by the United States and the subsequent widespread usage of the word to describe all brands of the compound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/business-27026704|title='Genericide': Brands destroyed by their own success|first=Simon|last=Tulett|date=27 May 2014|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref> It is now widely used in the US, UK, and France for all brands of the drug. However, it is still a registered trademark of Bayer in more than 80 other countries, including Canada, Mexico, Germany, and Switzerland.  As of 2011, approximately 40,000 tons of aspirin are produced each year and 10-20 billion tablets are taken in the United States alone each year for prevention of cardiovascular events.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fuster V, Sweeny JM |title=Aspirin: a historical and contemporary therapeutic overview |journal=Circulation |volume=123 |issue=7 |pages=768–78 |year=2011 |pmid=21343593 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.963843 |url=}}</ref> It is on the [[WHO Model List of Essential Medicines]], the most important medications needed in a basic [[health system]].<ref>{{cite web |title=WHO Model List of EssentialMedicines |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/93142/1/EML_18_eng.pdf?ua=1 |work=World Health Organization |date=October 2013}}</ref>

There has been controversy over the roles played by Bayer scientists in the development of aspirin.  [[Arthur Eichengrün]], a Bayer chemist, claimed to be the first to discover an [[aspirin]] formulation which did not have the unpleasant [[adverse effect|side effects]] of [[nausea]] and [[gastric pain]]. Eichengrün also claimed that he invented the name aspirin and was the first person to use the new formulation to test its safety and efficacy. Bayer contends that aspirin was discovered by [[Felix Hoffmann]] to alleviate the sufferings of his father, who had [[arthritis]]. Various sources support the conflicting claims.<ref>{{Cite press release|title=Annual Conference Press Release.pdf|date=1999|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|url=http://www.rsc.org/pdf/pressoffice/1999/annconf99press3.pdf|quote=Jewish Scientist's Claim to Discover Aspirin Denied by Nazis|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050528215006/http://www.rsc.org/pdf/pressoffice/1999/annconf99press3.pdf|archive-date=28 May 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrp.org/testimonypresentations/EPApesticide.php |title=Should EPA Accept Human Pesticide Experiments |publisher=Ahrp.org |accessdate=2011-06-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110614104951/http://www.ahrp.org/testimonypresentations/EPApesticide.php| archivedate= 14 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Most mainstream historians attribute the invention of aspirin to Felix Hoffmann and/or Arthur Eichengrün.<ref name="Sneader W 2000 1591–4">{{cite journal |author=Sneader W |title=The discovery of aspirin: a reappraisal |journal=BMJ |volume=321 |issue=7276 |pages=1591–4 |year=2000 |pmid=11124191 |pmc=1119266 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.321.7276.1591|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mahdi JG, Mahdi AJ, Mahdi AJ, Bowen ID |title=The historical analysis of aspirin discovery, its relation to the willow tree and antiproliferative and anticancer potential |journal=Cell Prolif. |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=147–55 |date=April 2006  |pmid=16542349 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2184.2006.00377.x |url=}}</ref>

===Heroin===
[[File:Bayer Heroin bottle.jpg|thumb|upright|Bayer Heroin bottle]]
[[Heroin]] (diacetylmorphine), now illegal as an addictive drug, was trademarked and marketed by Bayer as a cough suppressant and non-addictive substitute for morphine from 1898 to 1910.<ref name=TimesUnion>Deborah Moore for the TimesUnion. 24 August 2014 [http://www.timesunion.com/518life/article/Heroin-A-brief-history-of-unintended-consequences-5705610.php Heroin: A brief history of unintended consequences]</ref> Bayer scientists were not the first to make heroin, but their scientists discovered ways to make it, and Bayer led commercialization of heroin.<ref name="CHFBio">{{cite web|title=Felix Hoffmann|url=https://www.chemheritage.org/historical-profile/felix-hoffmann|website=Chemical Heritage Foundation|accessdate=18 November 2016}}</ref> ''Heroin'' was a Bayer trademark until after World War I.<ref>Jim Edwards for Business Insider. 17 November 2011.

===Phenobarbital===
In 1903, Bayer licensed the patent for the hypnotic drug diethylbarbituic acid from its inventors Emil Fischer and Joseph von Mering. It was marketed under the trade name Veronal as a sleep aid beginning in 1904. Systematic investigations of the effect of structural changes on potency and duration of action at Bayer led to the discovery of [[phenobarbital]] in 1911 and the discovery of its potent anti-epileptic activity in 1912. Phenobarbital was among the most widely used drugs for the treatment of epilepsy through the 1970s, and as of 2014, remains on the World Health Organization's list of essential medications.<ref name="Yasiry Z, Shorvon SD 26–39">{{cite journal |vauthors=Yasiry Z, Shorvon SD |title=How phenobarbital revolutionized epilepsy therapy: the story of phenobarbital therapy in epilepsy in the last 100 years |journal=Epilepsia |volume=53 Suppl 8 |issue= |pages=26–39 |date=December 2012  |pmid=23205960 |doi=10.1111/epi.12026 |url=}}</ref><ref name="López-Muñoz F, Ucha-Udabe R, Alamo C 329–43">{{cite journal |vauthors=López-Muñoz F, Ucha-Udabe R, Alamo C |title=The history of barbiturates a century after their clinical introduction |journal=Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=329–43 |date=December 2005  |pmid=18568113 |pmc=2424120 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

===Prior to World War II===
As part of the reparations after [[World War I]], Bayer assets, including the rights to its name and trademarks, were confiscated in the United States, Canada, and several other countries.<ref name="bayer1"/> In the United States and Canada, Bayer's assets and trademarks were acquired by [[Sterling Drug]], a predecessor of [[Sterling Winthrop]]. In 1994, Bayer AG purchased Sterling Winthrop's [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] drug business from [[SmithKline Beecham]] and merged it with Miles Laboratories, thereby reclaiming the U.S. and Canadian trademark rights to "Bayer" and the Bayer cross, as well as the ownership of the Aspirin trademark in Canada.<ref name=latsept1994>{{cite news|last=OLMOS|first=DAVID|title=German Firm to Reclaim Bayer Aspirin Name : Drugs: It will acquire Sterling Winthrop's over-the-counter business and recover the rights it lost after WWI|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-09-13/business/fi-38019_1_bayer-aspirin|accessdate=3 May 2013|newspaper=LA Times|date=Sep 14, 1994}}</ref>

In 1916 Bayer scientists discovered [[suramin]], an anti-[[trypanosomes|parasite]] drug that is still sold by Bayer under the [[brand name]] Germanin. The formula of suramin was kept secret by Bayer for commercial reasons; however, it was elucidated and published in 1924 by [[Ernest Fourneau]] and his team of the [[Pasteur Institute]].<ref>Walter Sneader.

Bayer became part of [[IG Farben]], a German chemical company conglomerate, in 1925.  In the 1930s, IG Farben scientists [[Gerhard Domagk]], Fritz Mietzsch, and Joseph Klarer, discovered [[prontosil]], the first commercially available antibacterial drug. The discovery and development of this first [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]] drug opened a new era in medicine.<ref>Hager, Thomas: ''The Demon Under the Microscope: From Battlefield Hospitals to Nazi Labs, One Doctor's Heroic Search for the World's First Miracle Drug''.

===World War II===
During World War II, IG Farben used [[slave labor]] in factories that it built adjacent to [[German concentration camps]], notably [[Auschwitz]],<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.wollheim-memorial.de/en/ig_auschwitz_en | title=Wollheim Memorial | place=Frankfurt am Main | publisher=Fritz Bauer Institute}}</ref> and the sub-camps of the [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]].<ref name="Memoriales">{{cite book | author = Various | language = Spanish | title = Memoriales históricos, 1933–1945 | year =2005 | chapter = Historia de los campos de concentración: El sistema de campos de concentración nacionalsocialista, 1933–1945: un modelo europeo | url = http://www.memoriales.net/}}</ref> IG Farben purchased prisoners for human experimentation of a sleep-inducing drug and later reported that all test subjects died.<ref name="ahrp.org">{{cite web|url=http://ahrp.org/auschwitz60-year-anniversary-the-role-of-ig-farben-bayer/|title=Auschwitz:60 Year Anniversary– the Role of IG Farben-Bayer|date=26 October 2006|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = Aushchwitz|last = Rees|first = Laurence|publisher = BBC Books|year = 2005|isbn = 0 563 52296 8|location = London|pages = 232}}</ref> IG Farben employees frequently said, "If you don’t work faster, you’ll be gassed."<ref>(Benedikt Kautsky, hearing of witness, January 29, 1953.

After [[World War II]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] broke up IG Farben and Bayer reappeared as an individual business "inheriting" many of IG Farben's assets.<ref name="ahrp.org"/> [[Fritz ter Meer]], an IG Farben board member from 1926 to 1945 who directed operations at the IG Farben plant at Auschwitz, was sentenced to seven years in prison during the [[IG Farben Trial|IG Farben Military Tribunal]] at Nuremberg.

===Post World War II===
{{Wide image|Pano-bayer-leverkusen.jpg|800px|Bayer factory in Leverkusen, Germany}}
In 1953 Bayer brought the first neuroleptic ([[Chlorpromazine]]) onto the German market.<ref>Hans Bangen: Geschichte der medikamentösen Therapie der Schizophrenie. Berlin 1992, {{ISBN|3-927408-82-4}}.</ref>

In the 1960s, Bayer introduced a pregnancy test, [[Primodos]], that consisted of two pills that contained [[norethisterone]] (as acetate) and [[ethinylestradiol]]. It detected pregnancy by inducing [[menstruation]] in women who were not pregnant. The presence or absence of menstrual bleeding was then used to determine whether the user was pregnant. The test became the subject of controversy when it was blamed for [[birth defect]]s, and it was withdrawn from the market in the mid-1970s.  Litigation in the 1980s regarding these claims ended inconclusively. A review of the matter by the [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] in 2014 assessed the studies performed to date, and concluded that it found the evidence for adverse effects to be inconclusive.<ref name=MHRAreview2014>{{cite web|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/comms-ic/documents/websiteresources/con404471.pdf|title=

In 1978, Bayer purchased [[Miles Laboratories]] and its subsidiaries Miles Canada and [[Cutter Laboratories]], acquiring along with them a variety of product lines including [[Alka-Seltzer]], [[Flintstones chewable vitamins|Flintstones vitamins]] and [[One A Day|One-A-Day]] vitamins, and Cutter [[insect repellent]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/adualtrusttrans02cuttrich/adualtrusttrans02cuttrich_djvu.txt "Cutter Laboratories: 1897–1972. A Dual Trust"]. The Bancroft Library, University of California/Berkeley, Regional Oral History Office, Transcript 1972–1974.</ref>

Along with the purchase of Cutter, Bayer acquired Cutter's [[Factor VIII]] business. Factor VIII, a clotting agent used to treat [[hemophilia]], was produced, at the time, by processing donated blood. In the [[History of HIV/AIDS#1981: From GRID to AIDS|early days of the AIDS epidemic]], people with hemophilia were found to have higher rates of AIDS, and by 1983 the CDC had identified [[Contaminated haemophilia blood products|contaminated blood products]] as a source of infection.<ref name = NYTimes2003>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/22/business/2-paths-of-bayer-drug-in-80-s-riskier-one-steered-overseas.html?pagewanted=print | title = 2 Paths of Bayer Drug in 80's: Riskier One Steered Overseas | author = [[Walt Bogdanich|Bogdanich, Walt]] |author2= [[Eric Koli|Koli, Eric]] |last-author-amp=yes | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 2003-05-22 | accessdate = 2012-04-09 }}</ref>  According to the New York Times, this was "one of the worst drug-related medical disasters in history."<ref name = NYTimes2003/> Companies, including Bayer, developed new ways to treat donated blood with heat to decontaminate it, and these new products were introduced early in 1984. In 1997, Bayer and the other three makers of such blood products agreed to pay $660 million to settle cases on behalf of more than 6,000 hemophiliacs infected in United States.<ref name = NYTimes2003/> But in 2003, documents emerged showing that Cutter had continued to sell unheated blood products in markets outside the US until 1985.<ref name = NYTimes2003/>

In the late 1990s, Bayer introduced a [[statin]] drug, Baycol ([[Cerivastatin]]) but after 52 deaths were attributed to it, Bayer discontinued it in 2001. The side effect was [[rhabdomyolysis]], causing [[renal failure]], which occurred with a tenfold greater frequency in patients treated with Baycol in comparison to those prescribed alternate medications of the statin class.<ref>{{Cite journal

Bayer has been involved in controversies regarding some of its other drug products; Trasylol ([[aprotinin]]), used to control bleeding during major surgery, was withdrawn from the markets worldwide when reports of increased mortality emerged; it was later re-introduced in Europe but not in the US.

===2000–2009===
In 2004, Bayer HealthCare AG acquired the over-the-counter (OTC) Pharmaceutical Division of [[Roche Pharmaceuticals]].<ref>{{Cite press release|title=Sale of Roche Consumer Health to Bayer completed|date=3 January 2005|publisher=Roche|url=http://www.roche.com/media/store/releases/med-cor-2005-01-03.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917084811/http://www.roche.com/media/store/releases/med-cor-2005-01-03.htm|archive-date=2016-09-17}}</ref>

====Acquisition of Schering====
In March 2006, [[Merck KGaA]] announced a €14.6bn bid for [[Schering AG]], which had been founded in 1851 and by 2006 had annual gross revenue of around €5 billion<ref>Schering AG press release. 20 Feb 2006 [http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/2005-a-record-year-for-schering-ag-55363567.html 2005 a Record Year for Schering AG]</ref> and employed about 26,000 people in 140 subsidiaries worldwide.<ref name=KumarMergers/> Bayer responded with a [[White knight (business)|white knight]] bid and in July acquired the majority of shares of Schering for €14.6bn,<ref>Marie-Eve Laforte for First Word Pharma. 12 July 2006 [http://www.firstwordpharma.com/node/144265 Bayer completes acquisition of Schering AG]</ref> and in 2007, Bayer took over Schering AG and formed Bayer Schering Pharma.

===2010 onwards===
====Spin off of Covestro====
In September 2015, Bayer spun out its $12.3 billion materials science division into a separate, publicly traded company called [[Covestro]] in which it retained about a 70% interest.<ref name="WSJCovestro2015"/><ref>
Joyce Gannon for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 1 September 2015 [http://www.post-gazette.com/business/healthcare-business/2015/09/01/Bayer-s-material-science-unit-now-under-Covestro-name-pittsburgh-robinson/stories/201509010151 Bayer MaterialScience assumes its new identity as Covestro]</ref> Bayer spun out the division because it had relatively low profit margins compared to its life science divisions (10.2%, compared with 24.9% for the agriculture business and 27.5% for healthcare) and because the business required high levels of investment to maintain its growth, and to more clearly focus its efforts and identity in the life sciences.<ref name=WSJCovestro2015>Christopher Alessi for the Wall Street Journal. 1 Sept. 2015 [https://www.wsj.com/articles/bayer-separates-material-science-business-covestro-1441121859 Bayer Separates Material Science Business Covestro]</ref>  Covestro shares were first offered on the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]] in October 2015.<ref>Sheenagh Matthews and Alex Webb for Bloomberg News.  6 October 2015 [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-06/covestro-jumps-on-first-day-of-trading-in-frankfurt-after-ipo Covestro Jumps on First Day of Trading in Frankfurt After IPO]</ref>

Effective January 2016 following the spinout of Covestro, Bayer rebranded itself as a life sciences company, and restructured into three divisions: Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Health, and Crop Science, which had an Animal Health business unit.<ref name=2015ARstructure>Bayer, 2015 Annual Report.

==Corporate structure==
In 2003, to separate operational and strategic managements, Bayer AG was reorganized into a [[holding company]]. The group's core businesses were transformed into limited companies, each controlled by Bayer [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]].

==Bayer 04 Leverkusen==
{{Main|Bayer 04 Leverkusen}}
In 1904, the company founded the sports club TuS 04 ("Turn- und Spielverein der Farbenfabriken vorm. Friedr. Bayer & Co."), later SV Bayer 04 ("Sportvereinigung Bayer 04 Leverkusen"), finally becoming [[TSV Bayer 04 Leverkusen]] ("Turn- und Sportverein") in 1984, generally, however, known simply as [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen]]. The club is best known for its football team, but has been involved in many other sports, including athletics, fencing, team handball, volleyball, boxing, and basketball. TSV Bayer 04 Leverkusen is one of the largest sports clubs in Germany. The company also supports similar clubs at other company sites, including Dormagen (particularly handball), Wuppertal (particularly volleyball), and Krefeld-Uerdingen (featuring another former Bundesliga football club, SC Bayer 05 Uerdingen, now [[KFC Uerdingen 05]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bayer04.de/B04-DEU/de/_site_index.aspx|title=Bayer 04 Leverkusen Fussball GmbH|work=bayer04.de}}</ref>
