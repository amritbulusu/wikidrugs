==Medical uses==
Metronidazole is primarily used to treat: [[bacterial vaginosis]], [[pelvic inflammatory disease]] (along with other antibacterials like [[ceftriaxone]]), [[pseudomembranous colitis]], [[aspiration pneumonia]], [[rosacea]] (topical), fungating wounds (topical), intra-abdominal infections, [[lung abscess]], [[periodontitis]], [[amoebiasis]], oral infections, [[giardiasis]], [[trichomoniasis]], and infections caused by susceptible anaerobic organisms such as ''[[Bacteroides]], [[Fusobacterium]], [[Clostridium]], [[Peptostreptococcus]]'', and ''[[Prevotella]]'' species.<ref name = AMH/> It is also often used to eradicate ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' along with other drugs and to prevent infection in people recovering from surgery.<ref name = AMH/>

===Bacterial vaginosis===
Drugs of choice for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis include metronidazole and [[clindamycin]]. The treatment of choice for bacterial vaginosis in nonpregnant women include metronidazole oral twice daily for seven days, or metronidazole gel intravaginally once daily for five days, or clindamycin intravaginally at bedtime for seven days. For pregnant women, the treatment of choice is metronidazole oral three times a day for seven days. Data does not report routine treatment of male sexual partners.<ref name="Joesoef">{{cite journal|last=Joesoef|first=MR|author2=Schmid, GP |author3=Hillier, SL |title=Bacterial vaginosis: review of treatment options and potential clinical indications for therapy.|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|date=Jan 1999|volume=28 Suppl 1|pages=S57-65|pmid=10028110|doi=10.1086/514725}}</ref>

===Trichomoniasis===
The 5-[[nitroimidazole]] drugs (metronidazole and [[tinidazole]]) are the mainstay of treatment for infection with ''[[Trichomonas vaginalis]]''. Treatment for both the infected patient and the patient's sexual partner is recommended, even if asymptomatic. Therapy other than 5-nitroimidazole drugs is also an option, but cure rates are much lower.<ref name="duBouchet1997">{{Cite journal | pmid = 9132982| year = 1997| author1 = Dubouchet| first1 = L| title = Multicenter comparison of clotrimazole vaginal tablets, oral metronidazole, and vaginal suppositories containing sulfanilamide, aminacrine hydrochloride, and allantoin in the treatment of symptomatic trichomoniasis| journal = Sexually transmitted diseases| volume = 24| issue = 3| pages = 156–60| last2 = Spence| first2 = M.

===Giardiasis===
Oral metronidazole is a treatment option for [[giardiasis]], however, the increasing incidence of nitroimidazole resistance is leading to the increased use of other compound classes.{{mcn|date=April 2016}}

===Dracunculus===
In the case of ''Dracunculus'' (guinea worm), metronidazole just eases worm extraction rather than killing the worm.<ref name=AHFS2015/>

===''C. difficile'' colitis===
Initial antibiotic therapy for less-severe ''Clostridium difficile'' colitis ([[pseudomembranous colitis]]) consists of oral metronidazole or oral vancomycin. Several randomized controlled trials have demonstrated equivalent efficacy of oral metronidazole and oral vancomycin in treating this colitis.<ref name="Zar">{{Cite journal | pmid = 17599306| year = 2007| author1 = Zar| first1 = F.

=== ''E. histolytica'' ===
Invasive [[colitis]] and extraintestinal disease including liver abscesses, pleuropulmonary infections, and brain abscesses can result from infection with ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]''. Metronidazole is widely used in patients with these infections.{{mcn|date=April 2016}}

===Preterm births===
Metronidazole has also been used in women to prevent [[preterm birth]] associated with [[bacterial vaginosis]], amongst other risk factors including the presence of cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin (fFN). Metronidazole was ineffective in preventing preterm delivery in high-risk pregnant women (selected by history and a positive fFN test) and, conversely, the incidence of preterm delivery was found to be higher in women treated with metronidazole.<ref name="Shennan2006">{{Cite journal | last1 = Shennan | first1 = A. | last2 = Crawshaw | first2 = S. | last3 = Briley | first3 = A. | last4 = Hawken | first4 = J. | last5 = Seed | first5 = P. | last6 = Jones | first6 = G. | last7 = Poston | first7 = L. | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2005.00788.x | title = General obstetrics: A randomised controlled trial of metronidazole for the prevention of preterm birth in women positive for cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin: The PREMET Study | journal = BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology | volume = 113 | issue = 1 | pages = 65–74 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16398774 | pmc = }}</ref>

[[Intravenous]] administration is commonly associated with [[thrombophlebitis]].

===Other drug interactions===
It also inhibits [[CYP2C9]], so may interact with medications metabolised by these enzymes (e.g. [[lomitapide]], [[warfarin]]).<ref name = MSR/>

==Mechanism of action==
Metronidazole is of the [[nitroimidazole]] class. It inhibits nucleic acid synthesis by disrupting the DNA of microbial cells.<ref name = MSR/> This function only occurs when metronidazole is partially reduced, and because this reduction usually happens only in anaerobic cells, it has relatively little effect upon human cells or [[aerobic bacteria]].<ref>

==Synthesis==
[[2-Methylimidazole]] ('''1''') may be prepared via the [[Debus-Radziszewski imidazole synthesis]], or from [[ethylenediamine]] and [[acetic acid]], followed by treatment with [[calcium oxide|lime]], then [[Raney nickel]]. 2-Methylimidazole is nitrated to give 2-methyl-4(5)-nitroimidazole ('''2'''), which is in turn [[alkylation|alkylated]] with [[ethylene oxide]] or [[2-chloroethanol]] to give metronidazole ('''3'''):<ref>{{ Ullmann | author = Ebel, K.; Koehler, H.; Gamer, A.

==Veterinary use==
Metronidazole  is widely used to treat infections of ''[[Giardia]]'' in dogs, cats, and other companion animals, although it does not reliably clear infection with this organism and is being supplanted by [[fenbendazole]] for this purpose in dogs and cats.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Barr | first1 = S.

Metronidazole is used in the aquarium hobby to treat ornamental fish and as a broad-spectrum treatment for bacterial and protozoan infections in reptiles and amphibians. In general, the veterinary community may use metronidazole for any potentially susceptible anaerobic infection. The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] suggests it only be used when necessary because it has been shown to be carcinogenic in mice and rats, as well as the microbes for which it is prescribed, and resistance can develop.<ref>{{cite book | author = Plumb, D.
