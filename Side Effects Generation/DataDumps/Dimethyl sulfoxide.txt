'''Dimethyl sulfoxide''' ('''DMSO''') is an [[organosulfur compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] ([[methyl|CH<sub>3</sub>]])<sub>2</sub>[[sulfur|S]][[oxygen|O]].  This colorless liquid is an important [[polar solvent|polar]] [[aprotic solvent]] that dissolves both [[chemical polarity|polar and nonpolar]] compounds and is [[miscible]] in a wide range of organic solvents as well as water.  It has a relatively high melting point.  DMSO has the unusual property that many individuals perceive a [[garlic]]-like taste in the mouth after contact with the skin.<ref>{{Cite book | editor-last = Novak | editor-first = K. M. | title = Drug Facts and Comparisons | edition = 56th | publisher = Wolters  Kluwer Health. | location = St. Louis, Missouri | year = 2002 | page = 619 | isbn = 1-57439-110-0}}</ref>

In terms of chemical structure, the molecule has idealized [[Molecular_symmetry#Common_point_groups|C<sub>s</sub>]] [[symmetry group|symmetry]]. It has a [[trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry]] consistent with other three-coordinate S(IV) compounds,<ref>R. Thomas, C. B. Shoemaker and K. Eriks "The molecular and crystal structure of dimethyl sulfoxide, (H<sub>3</sub>C)<sub>2</sub>SO" Acta Crystallogr. 1966. vol. 21, pp. 12-20.  {{DOI|10.1107/S0365110X66002263}}</ref> with a [[lone pair|nonbonded electron pair]] on the approximately [[Tetrahedral molecular geometry|tetrahedral]] sulfur atom.

==Synthesis and production==
It was first synthesized in 1866 by the Russian scientist [[Alexander Mikhaylovich Zaytsev|Alexander Zaytsev]], who reported his findings in 1867.<ref>A. Saytzeff (1867) [https://books.google.com/books?id=uelSAAAAcAAJ&lpg=PA148&pg=PA148#v=onepage&q&f=false "Ueber die Einwirkung von Saltpetersäure auf Schwefelmethyl und Schwefeläthyl"] (On the effect of nitric acid on methyl sulfide and ethyl sulfide) ''Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie'', '''144''': 148–156; see page 150, where dimethyl sulfoxide is called "Dimethylschwefeloxyd".</ref>  Dimethyl sulfoxide is produced industrially from [[dimethyl sulfide]], a by-product of the [[Kraft process]], by oxidation with oxygen or [[nitrogen dioxide]].<ref>Kathrin-Maria Roy "Sulfones and Sulfoxides" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a25_487}}</ref>

==Reactions==

===Reactions with electrophiles===
The sulfur center in DMSO is [[nucleophilic]] toward soft [[electrophile]]s and the oxygen is nucleophilic toward hard electrophiles.  With [[methyl iodide]] it forms [[trimethylsulfoxonium iodide]], [(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>SO]I:

:(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO  +  CH<sub>3</sub>I  &rarr;  [(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>SO]I

This salt can be [[deprotonated]] with [[sodium hydride]] to form the [[sulfur]] [[ylide]]:

:[(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>SO]I  +  NaH  &rarr; (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S(CH<sub>2</sub>)O  +  NaI  +  H<sub>2</sub>

===Acidity===
The methyl groups of DMSO are only weakly acidic, with a p''K''<sub>a</sub>=35.  For this reason, the basicities of many weakly basic organic compounds have been examined in this solvent.

Deprotonation of DMSO requires strong bases like [[lithium diisopropylamide]] and [[sodium hydride]].  Stabilization of the resultant [[carbanion]] is provided by the S(O)R group.  The sodium derivative of DMSO formed in this way is referred to as "[[dimsyl sodium]]".  It is a base, e.g., for the deprotonation of [[ketones]] to form sodium [[enolates]], [[phosphonium salt]]s to form [[Wittig reagent]]s, and [[formamidinium]] salts to form [[diaminocarbene]]s.  It is also a potent nucleophile.

===Oxidant===
In [[organic synthesis]], DMSO is used as a mild oxidant,<ref>

===Ligand===
Related to its ability to dissolve many salts, DMSO is a common [[ligand]] in [[coordination chemistry]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ccr.2004.02.005| title = Structure and bonding in metal sulfoxide complexes: An update| journal = Coordination Chemistry Reviews| volume = 248| issue = 3–4| pages = 351–375| year = 2004| last1 = Calligaris| first1 = Mario}}</ref> Illustrative is the complex [[dichlorotetrakis(dimethyl sulfoxide)ruthenium(II)]] (RuCl<sub>2</sub>(dmso)<sub>4</sub>). In this complex, three DMSO ligands are bonded to [[ruthenium]] through sulfur. The fourth DMSO is bonded through oxygen. In general, the oxygen-bonded mode is more common.

==Applications==

===Solvent===
[[File:Vacuum distillation of DMSO at 70C.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Distillation of DMSO requires a partial vacuum to achieve a lower boiling point.]]
DMSO is a [[polar aprotic solvent]] and is less toxic than other members of this class, such as [[dimethylformamide]], [[dimethylacetamide]], [[Methylpyrrolidone|''N''-methyl-2-pyrrolidone]], and [[Hexamethylphosphoramide|HMPA]]. DMSO is frequently used as a [[solvent]] for chemical reactions involving salts, most notably [[Finkelstein reaction]]s and other [[nucleophilic substitution]]s. It is also extensively used as an extractant in biochemistry and cell biology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exactantigen.com/review/DMSO.html |title=DMSO|accessdate=2009-10-02|work=exactantigen.com}}</ref> Because DMSO is only weakly acidic, it tolerates relatively strong bases and as such has been extensively used in the study of [[carbanion]]s.  A set of non-aqueous [[pKa]] values (C-H, O-H, S-H and N-H acidities) for thousands of organic compounds have been determined in DMSO solution.<ref>

Because of its high boiling point, {{convert|189|C|F}}, DMSO evaporates slowly at normal atmospheric pressure. Samples dissolved in DMSO cannot be as easily recovered compared to other solvents, as it is very difficult to remove all traces of DMSO by conventional [[rotary evaporation]]. One technique to fully recover samples is removal of the organic solvent by evaporation followed by addition of water (to dissolve DMSO) and [[freeze-drying|cryodesiccation]] to remove both DMSO and water. Reactions conducted in DMSO are often diluted with water to precipitate or phase-separate products. The relatively high freezing point of DMSO, {{convert|18.5|C|F}}, means that at, or just below, room temperature it is a solid, which can limit its utility in some chemical processes (e.g. [[crystallization]] with cooling).

In its [[deuterium|deuterated]] form ([[Deuterated DMSO|DMSO-d<sub>6</sub>]]), it is a useful solvent for [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] spectroscopy, again due to its ability to dissolve a wide range of analytes, the simplicity of its own spectrum, and its suitability for high-temperature NMR spectroscopic studies. Disadvantages to the use of [[Deuterated DMSO|DMSO-d<sub>6</sub>]] are its high viscosity, which broadens signals, and its [[hygroscopicity]], which leads to an overwhelming H<sub>2</sub>O resonance in the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum. It is often mixed with [[deuterated chloroform|CDCl<sub>3</sub>]] or [[deuterated dichloromethane|CD<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>]] for lower viscosity and melting points.

===Biology===
DMSO is used in [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) to inhibit [[Stem-loop|secondary structures]] in the [[DNA#Polymerases|DNA template]] or the [[DNA primer]]s. It is added to the PCR mix before reacting, where it interferes with the self-complementarity of the DNA, minimizing interfering reactions.<ref>

DMSO in a PCR reaction is applicable for supercoiled plasmids (to relax before amplification) or DNA templates with high [[GC-content]] (to decrease [[thermostability]]).

===Medicine===
Use of DMSO in medicine dates from around 1963, when an [[Oregon Health & Science University]] Medical School team, headed by [[Stanley Jacob]], discovered it could penetrate the skin and other membranes without damaging them and could carry other compounds into a biological system. In medicine, DMSO is predominantly used as a topical [[analgesic]], a vehicle for topical application of pharmaceuticals, as an [[anti-inflammatory]], and an [[antioxidant]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Johannes Geiss |title=The century of space science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=22FJysl__WcC&pg=PA20#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Kluwer Academic |year=2001 |page=20 |isbn=0-7923-7195-X|accessdate=Aug 7, 2011}}</ref> Because DMSO increases the rate of absorption of some compounds through organic [[Biological tissue|tissues]], including [[skin]], it is used in some [[transdermal]] [[drug delivery]] systems.  Its effect may be enhanced with the addition of [[EDTA]]. It is frequently compounded with antifungal medications, enabling them to penetrate not just skin but also toenails and fingernails.

DMSO has been examined for the treatment of numerous conditions and ailments, but the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has approved its use only for the symptomatic relief of patients with [[interstitial cystitis]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_169.html|title=Import Alert 62-06|website=www.accessdata.fda.gov|access-date=2017-03-05}}</ref> A 1978 study concluded that DMSO brought [[statistical significance|significant]] relief to the majority of the 213&nbsp;patients with inflammatory [[genitourinary]] disorders that were studied.<ref>

In [[interventional radiology]], DMSO is used as a solvent for [[EVOH|ethylene vinyl alcohol]] in the [[Onyx (Interventional radiology)|Onyx]] liquid embolic agent, which is used in [[embolization]], the therapeutic occlusion of blood vessels.

In medical research, DMSO is often used as a drug vehicle in ''[[in vivo]]'' and ''[[in vitro]]'' experiments. However, when a researcher is unaware of its [[Pleiotropy (drugs)|pleiotropic]] effects, or when the control groups are not carefully planned, a bias can occur; an effect of DMSO can be falsely attributed to the drug.<ref name=" kelava ">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kelava T, Cavar I | title = Biological actions of drug solvents | journal = Periodicum Biologorum | volume = 113 | issue = 3| pages = 311–320 |date=Nov 2011 | pmid = | doi = | url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/74090}}</ref> For example, even a very low dose of DMSO has a powerful protective effect against [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen)-induced liver injury in mice.<ref name=" PMID 20962895 ">{{cite journal | author = Kelava T, Cavar I | title = Influence of small doses of various drug vehicles on acetaminophen-induced liver injury | journal = Can J Physiol Pharmacol | volume = 88 | issue = 10 | pages = 980–87 |date=Oct 2010 | doi = 10.1139/Y10-065| pmid = 20962895| last2 = Cavar | last3 = Culo }}</ref>

In [[cryobiology]] DMSO has been used as a [[cryoprotectant]] and is still an important constituent of cryoprotectant [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrification]] mixtures used to preserve organs, tissues, and cell suspensions. Without it, up to 90% of frozen cells will become inactive. It is particularly important in the freezing and long-term storage of [[embryonic stem cells]] and [[hematopoietic stem cell]]s, which are often frozen in a mixture of 10%&nbsp;DMSO, a freezing medium, and 30% [[fetal bovine serum]]. In the cryogenic freezing of heteroploid cell lines (MDCK, VERO, etc.) a mixture of 10%&nbsp;DMSO with 90%&nbsp;[[EMEM]] (70%&nbsp;EMEM + 30%&nbsp;fetal bovine serum + antibiotic mixture) is used. As part of an [[autologous]] [[bone marrow transplant]] the DMSO is re-infused along with the patient's own [[hematopoietic stem cell]]s.

DMSO is metabolized by [[disproportionation]] to [[dimethyl sulfide]] and [[dimethyl sulfone]]. It is subject to renal and pulmonary excretion. A possible side effect of DMSO is therefore elevated blood dimethyl sulfide, which may cause a blood borne [[halitosis]] symptom.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===Alternative medicine===
DMSO is marketed as an [[alternative medicine]]. Its popularity as an alternative cure is stated to stem from a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' documentary featuring an early proponent.<ref name=NCAHF>>[http://www.ncahf.org/articles/c-d/dmso.html DMSO], [[National Council Against Health Fraud]]</ref> However, DMSO is an ingredient in some products listed by the U.S. FDA as fake cancer cures<ref name="FDA-fake">[http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/EnforcementActivitiesbyFDA/ucm171057.htm 187 fake cancer "cures" to avoid], FDA</ref> and the FDA has had a running battle with distributors.<ref name=NCAHF /> One such distributor is Mildred Miller, who promoted DMSO for a variety of disorders and was consequently convicted of [[Medicare fraud]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncahf.org/articles/c-d/dmso.html|title=DMSO|website=www.ncahf.org|access-date=2017-03-05}}</ref>

===Veterinary medicine===
DMSO is commonly used in veterinary medicine as a [[liniment]] for [[horse]]s, alone or in combination with other ingredients.  In the latter case, often, the intended function of the DMSO is as a solvent, to carry the other ingredients across the skin.  Also in horses, DMSO is used intravenously, again alone or in combination with other drugs.  It is used alone for the treatment of increased intracranial pressure and/or cerebral edema in horses.

The perceived garlic taste upon skin contact with DMSO may be due to [[olfaction|nonolfactory]] activation of [[Transient receptor potential cation channel, member A1|TRPA1]] receptors in [[trigeminal ganglia]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0077998|title=Transient Receptor Potential Channels Encode Volatile Chemicals Sensed by Rat Trigeminal Ganglion Neurons|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=10|pages=e77998|date=October 21, 2013|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0077998|pmid=24205061|last1=Lübbert|first1=Matthias|last2=Kyereme|first2=Jessica|last3=Schöbel|first3=Nicole|last4=Beltrán|first4=Leopoldo|last5=Wetzel|first5=Christian Horst|last6=Hatt|first6=Hanns|bibcode=2013PLoSO...877998L|pmc=3804614}}</ref>  Unlike [[dimethyl disulfide|dimethyl]] and [[diallyl disulfide|diallyl]] disulfide (also with odors resembling garlic), the [[dimethyl sulfide|mono-]] and [[dimethyl trisulfide|tri-]] sulfides (typically with disgusting odors), and other similar structures, the pure chemical DMSO is odorless.

==Safety==

===Toxicity===
DMSO is a non-toxic solvent with a [[median lethal dose]] higher than ethanol (DMSO: LD<sub>50</sub> Oral-Rat-14,500&nbsp;mg/kg;<ref>[http://www.gaylordchemical.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GAYLORD-CHEMICAL-SDS-DMSO-US-OSHA-01062016.pdf][http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9927347], [[Material Safety Data Sheet DMSO]]</ref> ethanol: LD<sub>50</sub> Oral-Rat-7,060&nbsp;mg/kg <ref>[http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9923955], [[Material Safety Data Sheet Ethanol]]</ref>).

Early clinical trials with DMSO were stopped because of questions about its safety, especially its ability to harm the eye. The most commonly reported side effects include headaches and burning and itching on contact with the skin. Strong allergic reactions have been reported.{{full citation needed|date=January 2013}} DMSO can cause contaminants, toxins, and medicines to be absorbed through the skin, which may cause unexpected effects. DMSO is thought to increase the effects of blood thinners, steroids, heart medicines, sedatives, and other drugs. In some cases this could be harmful or dangerous.<ref name=ACS>[http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/pharmacologicalandbiologicaltreatment/dmso DMSO] information from [[American Cancer Society]]</ref> It is a developmental neurotoxin.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 19100327 | year = 2009 | last1 = Hanslick | first1 = JL | last2 = Lau | first2 = K | last3 = Noguchi | first3 = KK | last4 = Olney | first4 = JW | last5 = Zorumski | first5 = CF | last6 = Mennerick | first6 = S | last7 = Farber | first7 = NB | title = Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) produces widespread apoptosis in the developing central nervous system | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–10 | doi = 10.1016/j.nbd.2008.11.006 | pmc = 2682536 | journal = Neurobiology of disease}}</ref>

Because DMSO easily penetrates the [[skin]], substances dissolved in DMSO may be quickly absorbed. [[Glove]] selection is important when working with DMSO. [[Butyl rubber]], [[fluoroelastomer]], [[neoprene]], or thick (15 [[mil (imperial)|mil]]) [[latex]] gloves are recommended.<ref>[http://mykin.com/rubber-chemical-resistance-chart-2 Rubber Chemical Resistance Chart]</ref> [[Nitrile rubber|Nitrile]] gloves, which are very commonly used in chemical laboratories, may protect from brief contact but have been found to degrade rapidly with exposure to DMSO.<ref>{{cite web

On September 9, 1965, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that a manufacturer of the chemical warned that the death of an Irish woman after undergoing DMSO treatment for a sprained wrist may have been due to the treatment, although no autopsy was done, nor was a causal relationship established.<ref>

</ref> However, chemically pure DMSO is odorless because of the lack of C-S-C ([[Sulfide#Organic chemistry|sulfide]]) and C-S-H ([[thiol|mercaptan]]) linkages. Deodorization of DMSO is achieved by removing the odorous impurities it contains.<ref>George Kvakovszky, ''et. al.'', "Process for preparing low malodorous dimethyl sulfoxide", US patent application number 20090005601 (2009).</ref>

===Explosions===
Dimethyl sulfoxide can produce an explosive reaction when exposed to [[acyl chloride]]s; at a low temperature, this reaction produces the [[oxidizing agent|oxidant]] for [[Swern oxidation]].

DMSO can decompose at the boiling temperature of 189&nbsp;°C at normal pressure,<ref name="Roth/Weller">Roth/Weller: ''Gefährliche Chemische Reaktionen'', ecomed Sicherheit, Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm, Landsberg/Lech, 31. Ergänzungslieferung 8/2000.</ref> possibly leading to an explosion. The decomposition is catalyzed by acids and bases and therefore can be relevant at even lower temperatures.<ref name="Roth/Weller"/> A strong to explosive reaction also takes place in combination with halogen compounds, metal nitrides, metal perchlorates, sodium hydride, periodic acid and fluorinating agents.<ref name="Roth/Weller"/><ref name="Römpp">[[Römpp Chemie Lexikon|Thieme Römpp Online]]</ref>{{full citation needed|date=January 2013}}
