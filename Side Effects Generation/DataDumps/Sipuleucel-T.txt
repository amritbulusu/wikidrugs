'''Sipuleucel-T''' (APC8015, trade name '''Provenge'''),<ref name="Plosker_2011"/><ref name="US6210662"/> developed by [[Dendreon]] Corporation, is a cell-based [[cancer immunotherapy]] for [[prostate cancer]] (CaP). It is a personalized treatment that works by programming each patient's immune system to seek out cancer and attack it as if it were foreign.

While referred to as a [[therapeutic vaccine]] rather than a preventive vaccine that prevents infectious disease, sipuleucel-T is instead an [[immunostimulant]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

On February 20, 2015, [[Valeant Pharmaceuticals]] received approval to purchase all Dendreon assets (including Provenge).

The treatment cost $93,000 at FDA approval, rising to over $100,000 in 2014.<ref name="Begley">[https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/11/us-drugs-dendreon-provenge-idUSBRE89A15420121011 Exclusive: Questionable data propped up cancer drug Provenge], By Sharon Begley, Reuters, Oct 11, 2012</ref>

== Treatment method ==

A course of treatment consists of three basic steps:

* The patient's white blood cells, primarily [[dendritic cell]]s, a type of [[antigen-presenting cells]] (APCs), are extracted in a [[leukapheresis]] procedure.
* The blood product is sent to a production facility and incubated with a fusion protein (PA2024) consisting of two parts:
** The [[antigen]] [[prostatic acid phosphatase]] (PAP), which is present in 95% of prostate cancer cells and
** An immune signaling factor [[granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor]] (GM-CSF) that helps the APCs to mature.
*The activated blood product (APC8015) is returned from the production facility to the infusion center and reinfused into the patient.<ref name="Kantoff" /><ref name="Small" />

A complete sipuleucel-T treatment includes three courses at two week intervals.<ref name="pmid16752945" />

== Use ==
Sipuleucel-T is used to treat people with [[metastatic]], asymptomatic, [[hormone-refractory prostate cancer]] (HRPC).  Other names for this stage are metastatic castrate-resistant (mCRPC) and androgen independent (AI) or (AIPC). This stage leads to mCRPC with lymph node involvement and distal (distant) tumors; this is the lethal stage of CaP. The [[prostate cancer staging]] designation is T4,N1,M1c.<ref name="Kantoff"/><ref name="Small"/><ref name="Longo"/>

==Clinical trials==

=== Completed ===
Sipuleucel-T showed [[survival rate|overall survival]] (OS) benefit to patients in three double-blind randomized [[phase III clinical trials]], D9901,<ref name="Small"/> D9902a,<ref name="Higano"/><ref name = "ECCO"/> and IMPACT.<ref name="Kantoff"/>

The IMPACT trial<ref name="Kantoff"/> served as the basis for FDA licensing. This trial enrolled 512 patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic HRPC randomized in a 2:1 ratio. The median survival time for sipuleucel-T patients was 25.8 months comparing to 21.7 months for placebo-treated patients, an increase of 4.1 months.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lacroix|first1=Marc|title=Targeted Therapies in Cancer|date=2014|publisher=Nova Sciences Publishers|location=Hauppauge, NY|isbn=978-1-63321-687-7|url=https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=50994}}</ref>  31.7% of treated patients survived for 36 months vs. 23.0% in the control arm.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kantoff|first1=Philip|title=Sipuleucel-T Immunotherapy for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=July 29, 2010|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1001294|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1001294|pmid=20818862|volume=363|issue=5|pages=411–22}}</ref>  Overall survival was [[statistically significant]] (P=0.032). The longer survival without tumor shrinkage or change in progression is surprising. This may suggest the effect of an unmeasured variable.<ref name="Longo"/>  The trial was conducted pursuant to a [[FDA Special Protocol Assessment]] (SPA), a set of guidelines binding trial investigators to specific agreed-upon parameters with respect to trial design, procedures and endpoints; compliance ensured overall scientific integrity and accelerated FDA approval.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The D9901 trial<ref name="Small"/> enrolled 127 patients with asymptomatic metastatic HRPC randomized in a 2:1 ratio. The median survival time for patients treated with sipuleucel-T was 25.9 months comparing to 21.4 months for placebo-treated patients. Overall survival was [[statistically significant]] ([[P-value|P=0.01]]).

The D9902a trial<ref name="Higano"/> was designed like the D9901 trial but enrolled 98 patients. The median survival time for patients treated with sipuleucel-T was 19.0 months comparing to 15.3 months for placebo-treated patients, but did not reach statistical significance.

===In progress===
As of August 2014, the PRO Treatment and Early Cancer Treatment (PROTECT) trial, a phase IIIB clinical trial started in 2001, was tracking subjects but no longer enrolling new subjects.<ref name="NCT00779402" /> Its purpose is to test efficacy for patients whose CaP is still controlled by either suppression of [[testosterone]] by hormone treatment or by [[surgical castration]]. Such patients have usually failed primary treatment of either surgical removal of the prostate, ([[EBRT]]), internal radiation, [[BNCT]] or ([[HIFU]]) for curative intent. Such failure is called biochemical failure and is defined as a PSA reading of 2.0&nbsp;ng/mL above nadir (the lowest reading taken post primary treatment).<ref name="Roach_2006" />

As of August 2014, a clinical trial administering sipuleucel-T in conjunction with [[ipilimumab]] (Yervoy) was tracking subjects but no longer enrolling new subjects; the trial evaluates the clinical safety and anti-cancer effects (quantified in PSA, radiographic and T cell response) of the combination therapy in patients with advanced prostate cancer.<ref name="sip-T-ipi-trial" />

==Side effects==
Common side effects include: bladder pain; bloating or swelling of the face, arms, hands, lower legs, or feet; bloody or cloudy urine; body aches or pain; chest pain; chills; confusion; cough; diarrhea; difficult, burning, or painful urination; difficulty with breathing; difficulty with speaking up to inability to speak; double vision; sleeplessnes; and inability to move the arms, legs, or facial muscles.<ref name="MayoClinic1">{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/sipuleucel-t-intravenous-route/side-effects/drg-20074285|title=Sipuleucel-T (Intravenous Route) - Side Effects |publisher=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=22 April 2015}}</ref><ref name="FDA1">{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/CellularGeneTherapyProducts/ApprovedProducts/UCM210031.pdf|title=Package Insert and Patient Information - Provenge (PDF - 157KB)|publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)|accessdate=22 April 2015}}</ref>

== Regulatory approval and reimbursement ==

Sipuleucel-T was approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) on April 29, 2010, to treat asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic HRPC.<ref name="Reuters approved"/><ref name= "FDA approval letter"/>

Shortly afterward, sipuleucel-T was added to the compendium of cancer treatments published by the [[National Comprehensive Cancer Network]] (NCCN) as a "category 1" (highest recommendation) treatment for HRPC. The NCCN Compendium is used by Medicare and major health care insurance providers to decide whether a treatment should be reimbursed.<ref name = "provenge-nccn"/><ref name="about-nccn"/>
