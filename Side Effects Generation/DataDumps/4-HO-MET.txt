'''4-HO-MET''' ('''4-hydroxy-''N''-methyl-''N''-ethyltryptamine''', '''metocin''', or '''methylcybin'''), is a lesser-known [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|psychedelic drug]]. It is a [[structural analog|structural]]− and [[Functional analog (chemistry)|functional analog]] of [[psilocin]] as well as the 4-[[hydroxyl]] [[analog (chemistry)|analog]] of [[N-Methyl-N-ethyltryptamine|methylethyltryptamine]] (MET). 4-HO-MET was first synthesized by [[Alexander Shulgin]]. In his book ''[[TiHKAL]]'' (''Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved''), the dosage is listed as 10-20 [[Milligram|mg]].<ref>{{CiteTiHKAL}}</ref> 4-HO-MET produces [[psilocin]]-like distortion of color, sound, and form. Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 4-HO-MET. There have been no reports of deaths from 4-HO-MET, even though people have reported taking doses up to 150&nbsp;mg,<ref name='erowid OD experience'> {{cite web | url = http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=71218 | title = Erowid Experience Vaults / Cosmic Mind Orgy | accessdate = 2014-02-25 | date = 2008-07-22 | publisher = [[Erowid]]}}</ref> more than an order of magnitude above the effective dose.<ref>http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.cgi?S1=436&S2=-1&C1=-1&Str=</ref>{{rs|date=December 2015}}

== Effects ==
{{medref|section|date=September 2017}}
Users report similar effects to [[psilocin]], including [[mydriasis]], closed and open eye visuals, [[euphoria]], time dilation and general change in thought processes. These effects occur in a wavelike pattern such as that of [[psilocybin]] with near-normal perception and high effect varying rapidly. The effects last for about 4–6 hours.<ref name='erowid effects'> {{cite web | url = http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/4_ho_met/4_ho_met_effects.shtml | title = 4-HO-MET Effects | accessdate = 2014-02-25 | publisher = [[Erowid]]}}</ref>
