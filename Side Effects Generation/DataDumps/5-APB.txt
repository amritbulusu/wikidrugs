'''5-APB''' (abbreviation of "<u>5-</u>(2-<u>a</u>mino<u>p</u>ropyl)<u>b</u>enzofuran"; see infobox for the correct IUPAC name) is an [[Empathogen-entactogen|empathogenic]] [[psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] compound of the [[substituted benzofuran]], [[substituted amphetamine]] and [[substituted phenethylamine]] classes. 5-APB and [[Benzofury (disambiguation)|other compounds]] are sometimes informally called "Benzofury".

5-APB is commonly found as the succinate and hydrochloride salt. The hydrochloride salt is 10% more potent by mass and doses should be adjusted accordingly.

5-APB has been sold as a [[designer drug]] since 2010.<ref>http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/implementation-reports/2010 EMCDDA–Europol 2010 Annual Report on the implementation of Council Decision 2005/387/JHA</ref>

==Pharmacology==
5-APB is a [[serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor]] with ''K''<sub>i</sub>([[norepinephrine transporter|NET]])=180&nbsp;nmol/L, ''K''<sub>i</sub>([[dopamine transporter|DAT]])=265&nbsp;nmol/L and ''K''<sub>i</sub>([[serotonin transporter|SERT]])=811&nbsp;nmol/L.{{r|Iversen2013}} It is also a serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Pharmacological profile of novel psychoactive benzofurans| year=2015| last1=Rickli| first1=A| last2=Kopf |first2=S |last3=Hoener |first3=MC |last4=Liechti |first4=ME| journal=British Pharmacological Society| volume=172| issue=13| doi=10.1111/bph.13128| pmc=4500375| pmid=25765500}}</ref> 5-APB is a potent [[agonist]] for the [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]] and [[5-HT2B receptor|5-HT<sub>2B</sub>]] receptors (K<sub>i</sub> of 14&nbsp;nmol/L at 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> with an efficacy of{{r|Iversen2013}} 0.924). This agonism for 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> makes it likely that 5-APB would be cardiotoxic with long term use, as seen in other 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> agonists such as [[fenfluramine]] and [[MDMA]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2017}} 5-APB is also an agonist of the [[5-HT2C|5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor]].<ref>{{ cite patent

==Detection==
A forensic standard of 5-APB is available, and the compound has been posted on the Forendex website of potential drugs of abuse.<ref>Southern Association of Forensic Scientists, http://forendex.southernforensic.org/index.php/detail/index/1135</ref> The [[United States Department of Justice|US Department of Justice]] and [[DEA]] have also conducted studies concerning the detection of 5-APB.<ref>USDOJ/DEA, http://www.justice.gov/dea/pr/microgram-journals/2011/mj8-2_62-74.pdf</ref>

==Effects==
Users describe effects as euphoric. Largely, effects reported were similar to that of the drug MDMA but not as strong.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}  Recreational use of 5-APB has been associated with death in combination with other drugs.<ref name=LATimes>{{cite news | url = http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-ucsd-student-drug-overdose-20140820-story.html | title = UCSD student dies of drug overdose after on-campus music festival | publisher = ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' | date = August 20, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid= 24012617 | quote = 5-APB ... has been implicated in 10 recent drug-related deaths in the UK | title = The effects of benzofury (5-APB) on the dopamine transporter and 5-HT2-dependent vasoconstriction in the rat | journal = Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry | date = Jan 3, 2014 | volume = 48 | pages = 57–63 |  doi = 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2013.08.013}}</ref>

==Legality==
On March 5, 2014 the UK Home Office announced that 6-APB would be made a class B drug on 10 June 2014 alongside every other benzofuran entactogen and many structurally related drugs.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2014/9780111110904 | title = The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Ketamine etc.) (Amendment) Order 2014 | accessdate = 2014-03-11 | author = UK Home Office | date = 2014-03-05 | publisher = UK Government}}</ref>
