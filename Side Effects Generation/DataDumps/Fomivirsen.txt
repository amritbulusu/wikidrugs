'''Fomivirsen''' (brand name '''Vitravene''') is an [[antisense therapy|antisense]] [[antiviral drug]] that was used in the treatment of [[cytomegalovirus retinitis]] (CMV) in [[immunocompromised]] patients, including those with [[AIDS]].  It was administered via intraocular injection.<ref name="isbn0-07-145153-6">{{cite book | author = Katzung, Bertram G. | title = Basic and Clinical Pharmacology | edition = 10th | language = | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical Publishing Division | location = New York | year = 2006 | origyear = | pages = 817 | quote = | isbn = 0-07-145153-6 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}</ref>

It was discovered at the NIH and was licensed and initially [[drug development|developed]] by [[Ionis Pharmaceuticals|Isis Pharmaceuticals]], which subsequently licensed it to [[Novartis]].<ref name=AJMC>{{cite news|last1=Bubela|first1=Tania|last2=McCabe|first2=Christopher|title=Value-Engineered Translation: Developing Biotherapeutics That Align With Health-System Needs|url=http://www.ajmc.com/journals/evidence-based-diabetes-management/2014/july-august-2014/value-engineered-translation-developing-biotherapeutics-that-align-with-health-system-needs/p-2|work=American Journal of Managed Care|date=21 July 2014}}</ref> It was licensed by the FDA for CMV in Aug 1998, and was the first antisense drug that was approved.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jiang|first1=Kevin|title=Biotech comes to its ‘antisenses’ after hard-won drug approval : Spoonful of Medicine|url=http://blogs.nature.com/spoonful/2013/02/biotech-comes-to-its-antisenses-after-hard-won-drug-approval.html|work=Nature Medicine: Spoonful of Medicine Blog|date=February 19, 2013}}</ref>  

Novartis withdrew the marketing authorization in the EU in 2002<ref>{{cite web|title=Public Statement on Vitravene (fomiversen): Withdrawal of the Marketing Authorization in the European Union|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Public_statement/2009/12/WC500018346.pdf|publisher=EMA|date=August 6, 2002}}</ref> and in the US in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|title=Initiating Coverage: Rexahn Pharmaceuticals (RNN)|url=http://www.baystreet.ca/articles/research_reports/lifesci/Rexahn052416.pdf|publisher=LifeSci Capital|date=May 23, 2016}}</ref>  The drug was withdrawn because while there was a high unmet need for drugs to treat CMV when the drug was initially discovered and developed due to the CMV arising in people with [[AIDS]], the development of [[HAART]] dramatically reduced the number of cases of CMV.<ref name=AJMC/>

It is an [[antisense]] [[oligonucleotide]] -- a synthetic 21 member [[oligonucleotide]] with [[thiophosphate|phosphorothioate]] linkages (which are resistant to degradation by [[nuclease]]s) and has the sequence:

* 5'-GCG TTT GCT CTT CTT CTT GCG-3'
