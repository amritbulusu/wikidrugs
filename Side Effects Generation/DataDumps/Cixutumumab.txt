'''Cixutumumab''' (IMC-A12) is a human [[monoclonal antibody]] for the treatment of solid tumors.<ref>[http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/365/cixutumumab.pdf Statement On A Nonproprietary Name Adopted By The Usan Council - Cixutumumab] ''American Medical Association.''</ref><ref>{{cite journal|pmid=19548856|year=2009|last1=McKian|first1=KP|last2=Haluska|first2=P|title=Cixutumumab|volume=18|issue=7|pages=1025â€“33|doi=10.1517/13543780903055049|journal=Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs|pmc=2939377}}</ref>

This drug was developed by [[ImClone Systems]], since acquired by [[Eli Lilly]], using [[phage display]] technology from [[Dyax]].

It is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against the human insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor ([[IGF-1R]]) with potential antineoplastic activity. Cixutumumab selectively binds to membrane-bound IGF-1R, thereby preventing the binding of the ligand IGF-1 and subsequent activation of [[PI3K]]/[[AKT]] signaling pathway. Downregulation of the PI3K/AKT survival pathway may result in the induction of cancer cell apoptosis and may decrease cancer cellular proliferation. IGF-1R, a receptor tyrosine kinase of the insulin receptor superfamily overexpressed by many cancer cell types, stimulates cell proliferation, enables oncogenic transformation, and suppresses apoptosis; IGF-1R signaling has been implicated in tumorigenesis and metastasis.<ref>[http://www.cancer.gov/drugdictionary/?CdrID=561575] ''National Cancer Institute''{{http://www.cancer.gov/drugdictionary/?CdrID=561575}}</ref>

Despite these extensive trials, more than 45 phase I and II clinical trials in total, phase III trials have never been undertaken and Eli Lilly has removed cixutumumab from their development pipeline.<ref>https://www.lilly.com/pipeline/index.html</ref>
