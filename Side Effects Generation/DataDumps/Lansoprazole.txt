<!-- Definition and medical uses -->
'''Lansoprazole''', sold under the brand name '''Prevacid''' among others, is a medication which inhibits the [[stomach]]'s production of [[gastric acid|acid]]. There is no evidence that its effectiveness is different from that of other PPIs.<ref name=TI(99)2016/> Lansoprazole, given through a [[Nasogastric intubation|nasogatric tube]], effectively controls [[pH]] inside the stomach and is an alternative to intravenous [[pantoprazole]] in people who are unable to swallow solid-dose formulations.<ref name="FrestonChiu2001">{{cite journal|last1=Freston|first1=James|last2=Chiu|first2=Yi-Lin|last3=Pan|first3=Wei-Jian|last4=Lukasik|first4=Nancy|last5=Taubel|first5=Jorg|title=Effects on 24-hour intragastric pH: a comparison of lansoprazole administered nasogastrically in apple juice and pantoprazole administered intravenously|journal=The American Journal of Gastroenterology|volume=96|issue=7|year=2001|pages=2058–2065|issn=0002-9270|doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.2001.03939.x|pmid=11467632}}</ref>

<!-- Mechanism -->
Lansoprazole is a [[proton-pump inhibitor]] (PPI) in the same pharmacologic class as [[omeprazole]].  Lansoprazole has been marketed for many years and is one of several PPIs available.<ref>http://www.patient.co.uk/showdoc/30002943/</ref> It is a [[racemate|racemic]] 1:1 mixture of the [[enantiomer]]s [[dexlansoprazole]] (Dexilant, [[Dexilant#Naming confusion|formerly named]] Kapidex) and levolansoprazole.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pharmacy Benefit Update|url=http://epharmacytechnicanschools.com/pharmacy-benefit-update/|accessdate=2 July 2014}}</ref> Dexlansoprazole is an enantiomerically pure active ingredient of a commercial drug as a result of the ''[[Chiral derivatizing agent|enantiomeric shift]]''. Lansoprazole's plasma elimination half-life (1.5 h) is not proportional to the duration of the drug's effects to the person (i.e. [[gastric acid]] suppression).<ref name="RxList">{{cite web | url = http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/lansop_cp.htm | title = Prevacid Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics, Studies, Metabolism | year = 2007 | accessdate = April 14, 2007 | publisher = RxList.com}}</ref> The effects of the medication last for over 24 hours after it has been used for a day or more.<ref name="prevacid24hr"/>

<!-- History and culture -->
It is manufactured by a number of companies worldwide under several [[#Brand names|brand names]]. In the United States, it was first approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1995.<ref name="Mosby's">[http://www.mosbysdrugconsult.com/DrugConsult/Top_200/Drugs/e3230.html Mosby's Drug Consult: Lansoprazole]</ref> Prevacid patent protection expired on November 10, 2009.<ref>[http://drugpatentwatch.com/ultimate/preview/tradename/index.php?query=PREVACID&archive=2008 Prevacid drug patents]</ref><ref name="Teva">[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/teva-to-release-prevacid-version-when-patent-expires Teva to release Prevacid version when patent expires]</ref>

==Medical uses==
Lansoprazole is used for treatment of:
* [[Peptic ulcer|Ulcers]] of the stomach and [[duodenum]], and [[NSAID]]-induced ulcers
* ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' infection, alongside [[antibiotics]] (adjunctive treatment), treatment to kill ''H. pylori'' causing ulcers or other problems involves using two other drugs besides lansoprazole known as "[[Helicobacter pylori eradication protocols|triple therapy]]", and involves taking twice daily for 10 or 14 days lansoprazole, [[amoxicillin]], and [[clarithromycin]]
* [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease]]
* [[Zollinger-Ellison syndrome]]<ref name="prevacid24hr" />

There is no good evidence that it works better than other PPIs.<ref name=TI(99)2016>{{cite web|title=[99] Comparative effectiveness of proton pump inhibitors {{!}} Therapeutics Initiative|url=http://www.ti.ubc.ca/2016/06/28/99-comparative-effectiveness-proton-pump-inhibitors/|accessdate=14 July 2016|date=28 June 2016}}</ref>

PPIs may be associated with a greater risk of hip fractures and ''[[Clostridium difficile colitis|Clostridium difficile]]''-associated [[diarrhea]].<ref name="prevacid24hr"/>{{rp|22}}

==Interactions==
Lansoprazole interacts with several other drugs, either due to its own nature or as a PPI.<ref>[http://bnf.org/bnf/bnf/current/41001i753.htm British National Formulary] (Free registration required) Lansoprazole interactions</ref>

* Increases plasma concentrations of [[cilostazol]] (risk of toxicity)

Lansoprazole possibly interacts with, among other drugs:
* [[sucralfate]]
* [[ampicillin]]
* [[bisacodyl]]
* [[clopidogrel]]
* [[delavirdine]]
* [[fluvoxamine]]
* iron salts
* [[voriconazole]]
* [[aminophylline]] and [[theophylline]]
