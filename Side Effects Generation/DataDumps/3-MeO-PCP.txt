==Pharmacology==
3-MeO-PCP has a K{{sub|i}} of 20&nbsp;nM for the [[dizocilpine]] (MK-801) site of the [[NMDA receptor]], 216&nbsp;nM for the [[serotonin transporter]] (SERT), and 42&nbsp;nM for the [[sigma receptor|sigma]] [[sigma-1 receptor|σ{{sub|1}} receptor]].<ref name="ACMD2012" /><ref name="pmid23527166" /> It does not bind to the [[norepinephrine transporter|norepinephrine]] or [[dopamine transporter]] nor to the sigma [[sigma-2 receptor|σ{{sub|2}} receptor]] (K<sub>i</sub> >10,000&nbsp;nM).<ref name="pmid23527166" /> Based on its structural similarity to [[3-hydroxy-PCP]] (3-HO-PCP), which uniquely among arylcyclohexylamines has high [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for the [[μ-opioid receptor]] in addition to the NMDA receptor, it was initially expected that 3-MeO-PCP would have [[opioid]] activity.<ref name="pmid24678061" /><ref name="Morris2011">{{cite web | url = https://www.vice.com/read/interview-with-ketamine-chemist-704-v18n2 | author = Morris, H. | date = 2011-02-11 | title=Interview with a ketamine chemist: or to be more precise, an arylcyclohexylamine chemist | publisher = Vice Magazine | accessdate = 2012-01-23 }}</ref> However, [[radioligand binding assay]]s with human proteins have shown that, contrary to common belief, the drug also does not interact with the [[μ-opioid receptor|μ-]], [[δ-opioid receptor|δ-]], or [[κ-opioid receptor|κ-]][[opioid receptor]]s at concentrations of up to 10,000&nbsp;nM.<ref name="pmid23527166" /> As such, the notion that 3-MeO-PCP has opioid activity has been described as a myth.<ref name="pmid24678061" />

3-MeO-PCP binds to the NMDA receptor with higher affinity than PCP and has the highest affinity of the three isomeric anisyl-substitutions of PCP, followed by [[2-MeO-PCP]] and [[4-MeO-PCP]].<ref name="pmid23527166" /><ref name="ACMD2012" />

==History==
3-MeO-PCP was first synthesized in 1979 to investigate the [[structure–activity relationship]]s of [[phencyclidine]] (PCP) [[chemical derivative|derivative]]s. The effects of 3-MeO-PCP in humans were not described until 1999 when a chemist using the pseudonym John Q.

==Society and culture==

===Legal status===

====United Kingdom====
On October 18, 2012 the [[Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs]] in the [[United Kingdom]] released a report] about [[methoxetamine]], saying that the "harms of methoxetamine are commensurate with [[Class B drug|Class B]] of the [[Misuse of Drugs Act of 1971|Misuse of Drugs Act (1971)]]".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/agencies-public-bodies/acmd1/methoxetamine2012 | title = Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) Methoxetamine report, 2012 | date = 18 October 2012 | publisher = Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs}}</ref> The report went on to suggest that all analogues of MXE should also become class B drugs and suggested a catch-all clause covering both existing and unresearched arylcyclohexylamines, including 3-MeO-PCP.<ref name="ACMD2012" />

====United States====
3-MeO-PCP is not a controlled substance in the [[United States]] but possession or distribution of 3-MeO-PCP for human use could potentially be prosecuted under the [[Federal Analogue Act]] due to its structural and pharmacological similarities to PCP.

====Sweden====
Sweden's public health agency suggested classifying 3-MeO-PCP as hazardous substance on November 10, 2014.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/nyheter-och-press/nyhetsarkiv/2014/november/cannabinoider-foreslas-bli-klassade-som-halsofarlig-vara/ | title=Cannabinoider föreslås bli klassade som hälsofarlig vara | accessdate=29 June 2015}}</ref>

====Czech Republic====
3-MeO-PCP is banned in the Czech Republic.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mzcr.cz/Admin/_upload/files/3/Nov%C3%A9%20PL.pdf | title=Látky, o které byl doplněn seznam č. 4 psychotropních látek (příloha č. 4 k nařízení vlády č. 463/2013 Sb.) | publisher=Ministerstvo zdravotnictví | language=Czech}}</ref>
