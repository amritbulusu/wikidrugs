===Foundation and early history===
[[File:Robert-wood-johnson-i.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Robert Wood Johnson]]
Inspired by a speech by [[antiseptic]] advocate [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]], [[Robert Wood Johnson I|Robert Wood Johnson]] joined his brothers [[James Wood Johnson]] and [[Edward Mead Johnson]] to create a line of ready-to-use [[Dressing (medical)|surgical dressings]] in 1885. The company produced its first products in 1886 and [[incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in 1887.

Robert Wood Johnson served as the first president of the company. He worked to improve [[sanitation]] practices in the nineteenth century, and lent his name to a [[Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital|hospital]] in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]]. Upon his death in 1910, he was succeeded in the presidency by his brother James Wood Johnson until 1932, and then by his son, [[Robert Wood Johnson (son)|Robert Wood Johnson II]].

Robert Wood Johnson's granddaughter, [[Mary Lea Johnson Richards]], was the first baby to appear on a Johnson & Johnson baby powder label.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/15/nyregion/about-books.html |work=The New York Times | title=About Books | first=Shirley | last=Horner | date=February 15, 1987 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q8HGjT8KnJkC&pg=PA126&lpg=PA126&dq=mary+lea+johnson+first+baby#v=onepage&q=mary%20lea%20johnson%20first%20baby&f=false |title=The Natural History of the Rich: A Field Guide |first=Richard |last=Conniff |publisher=W.

===1959: McNeil Consumer Healthcare===
McNeil Consumer Healthcare was founded on March 16, 1879 by 23-year-old Robert McNeil. In 1904, one of McNeil's sons, Robert Lincoln McNeil, became part of the company and together they created McNeil Laboratories in 1933. The company focused on [[direct marketing]] of prescription drugs to hospitals, pharmacists, and doctors. Development of [[acetaminophen]] began under the leadership of [[Robert L. McNeil, Jr.]], who later served as the firm's chairman.<ref>{{cite news|last=Singer|first=Natasha|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/04/business/04mcneil.html?pagewanted=print|title=Robert L. McNeil Jr., Chemist Who Introduced Tylenol, Dies at 94|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 3, 2010|accessdate=June 4, 2010}}</ref> In 1959, Johnson & Johnson acquired McNeil Laboratories and a year later the company was able to sell [[Tylenol (brand)|Tylenol]] for the first time ever, without a prescription. In 1977, two subsidiary companies were created; [[McNeil medicals products]] and [[McNeil Consumer Products Company]] (also known as McNeil Consumer Healthcare). The focus of McNeil medicals products is to market prescription drugs. In 1993 McNeil medicals products merged with the [[Ortho Pharmaceutical]] to form [[Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical]]. In 2001 McNeil Consumer Healthcare changed its name to McNeil Consumer & Specialty medicals products. However, it was later changed to "McNeil Consumer Healthcare".  The company markets [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] and [[Prescription drug|prescription]] medicals products including complete lines of [[Tylenol (brand)|Tylenol]] and [[Motrin]] IB ([[ibuprofen]]) products for adults and children.

===1959: Cilag===
In 1933, Swiss chemist [[Bernhard Joos]] set up a small research laboratory in [[Schaffhausen]], [[Switzerland]]. This set the basis for the founding of Chemische Industrie-Labor AG (Chemical Industry Laboratory AG or Cilag) on 12 May 1936. In 1959, Cilag joined the Johnson & Johnson family of companies. In the early nineties the marketing organizations of Cilag and [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]] were joined to form [[Janssen-Cilag]]. The non-marketing activities of both companies still operate under their original name. Cilag continues to have operations under the Cilag name in Switzerland, ranging from research and development through manufacturing and international services. In August 2014 Cilag acquired [[Covagen]] a biopharmaceutical company which specialises in the development of multi-specific protein based therapeutics. As part of the acquisition Cilag wll gain access to Covagen’s lead drug candidate, [[COVA 322]], a bi-specific anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha/anti-interleukin (IL)-17A FynomAb, is in a Phase Ib study for [[psoriasis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/janssen-affiliate-cilag-acquires-covagen/81250273/|title=Janssen Affiliate Cilag Acquires Covagen|work=GEN}}</ref>

===1961: Janssen Pharmaceuticals===
Janssen Pharmaceuticals can be traced back to 1933. In 1933 [[Constant Janssen]], the father of Paul Janssen, acquired the right to distribute the pharmaceutical products of [[Gedeon Richter Ltd.|Richter]], a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] pharmaceutical company, for Belgium, the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgian Congo]]. On 23 October 1934, he founded the N.V. Produkten Richter in [[Turnhout]]. After the Second World War, the name for the company products was changed to Eupharma, although the company name Richter would remain until 1956.<ref name=JanssenHist>{{cite journal|last1=Lopez-Munoz|first1=Francisco|last2=Alamo|first2=Cecilio|title=The Consolidation of Neuroleptic Therapy: Janssen, the Discovery of Haloperidol and Its Introduction into Clinical Practice|journal=Brain Research Bulletin|date=2009|volume=79|pages=130–141|pmid= 19186209|doi=10.1016/j.brainresbull.2009.01.005}}</ref>

Paul Janssen founded his own research laboratory in 1953 on the third floor of the building in the Statiestraat, still within the Richter-Eurpharma company of his father. On 5 April 1956, the name of the company was changed to NV Laboratoria Pharmaceutica C. Janssen (named after Constant Janssen). On 2 May 1958, the research department in Beerse became a separate legal entity, the N.V. Research Laboratorium C. Janssen. On 24 October 1961, the company was acquired by the American corporation Johnson & Johnson. On 10 February 1964, the name was changed to Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. Between 1990 and 2004, Janssen Pharmaceuticals expanded worldwide, with the company grew in size to approximately 28000 employees worldwide. In 1999, clinical research and non-clinical development become a global organization within Johnson & Johnson. In 2001, part of the research activities was transferred to the United States with the reorganization of research activities in the [[Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development]] organization. The research activities of the Janssen Research Foundation and the R.W. Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute were merged into the new global research organization. On 27 October 2004, the Paul Janssen Research Center, for discovery research, was inaugurated.

In August 2013, the company acquired [[Aragon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.]]. In November 2014, the company acquired [[Alios BioPharma, Inc.]] for $1.75 billion.

== JNJ Headquarters and the New Brunswick gentrification ==
The company has historically been located on the [[Delaware and Raritan Canal]] in New Brunswick. The company considered moving its headquarters out of New Brunswick in the 1960s, but decided to stay in the town after city officials promised to gentrify downtown New Brunswick by demolishing old buildings and constructing new ones.

While New Brunswick lost at least one historic edifice (the inn where [[Rutgers University]] began) to the redevelopment, the gentrification did attract people back to New Brunswick. Johnson & Johnson hired [[Henry N. Cobb]] from [[Pei Cobb Freed & Partners]] to design an addition to its headquarters. The white tower in a park across the [[Northeast Corridor|railroad tracks]] from the older portion of the headquarters in one of [[List of tallest buildings in New Brunswick|tallest buildings in New Brunswick]].

The stretch of Delaware and Raritan canal by the company's headquarters was replaced by a stretch of [[New Jersey Route 18|Route 18]] in the late 1970s,<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=F00714FC345D167493CBA9178CD85F438785F9 2 Long-Disputed Projects to Begin], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 9, 1977</ref> after a lengthy dispute.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=FA0914FC355F167493C4A8178FD85F438785F9 Old Raritan Canal Lock Is Focus of a Classic Dispute], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 16, 1977.</ref> In 2002, the company released its plan of setting up Asia-Pacific information technology headquarters in New South Wales within five years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LC20020314023 |title= JOHNSON & JOHNSON ASIA-PACIFIC INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY HEADQUARTERS |date=March 14, 2002 |accessdate=July 15, 2013}}</ref>

==Products==
The company's business is divided into three major segments, Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices, and Consumer Products.  In 2015, these segments contributed 44.9%, 35.9%, and 19.3%, respectively, of the company's total revenues.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/JNJ/1709744668x0x881109/474857DD-8E67-43B1-BB38-0A9712D93545/2015_annual_report_.pdf |format=PDF|work=files.shareholder.com |title=Downloads |accessdate=}}</ref>

===Pharmaceuticals===
The company's major franchises in the Pharmaceutical segment include Immunology, Neuroscience, Infectious Disease, and Oncology.

Immunology products include the anti-[[tumor necrosis factor]] antibodies Remicade ([[infliximab]]), and Simponi ([[golimumab]]) used for the treatment<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/103772s5359lbl.pdf |title=www.accessdata.fda.gov |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> of autoimmune diseases, including [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[Crohn's disease]] (Remicade only), [[ulcerative colitis]], [[ankylosing spondylitis]], and other disorders. In 2013, these two products accounted for 29% of Johnson and Johnson's pharmaceutical revenues, and 11.3% of the company's total revenues.  A third immunology product, Stelara ([[ustekinumab]]), targets [[interleukin-12]] and [[interleukin-23]] and is used for the treatment of [[psoriasis]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/125261s114lbl.pdf |title=www.accessdata.fda.gov |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Key infectious diseases products include Incivio ([[telaprevir]]), a hepatitis C protease inhibitor; Intelence ([[Etravirine]]), a non-nucleoside HIV polymerase inhibitor; and Prezista ([[darunavir]]), an HIV protease inhibitor. Telaprevir sales are expected to decline due to the recent approval of treatment regimens that are more efficacious and much better tolerated. Etravirine and darunavir are notable for their high barriers to resistance development.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ruela Corrêa JC, D'Arcy DM, dos Reis Serra CH, Nunes Salgado HR |title=Darunavir: a critical review of its properties, use and drug interactions |journal=Pharmacology |volume=90 |issue=1-2 |pages=102–9 |year=2012 |pmid=22797653 |doi=10.1159/000339862 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://tools.wmflabs.org/citation-template-filling/cgi-bin/index.cgi?ddb=&type=pubmed_id&id=++++23560740 |title=Wikipedia template filling |publisher=Tools.wmflabs.org |accessdate=2014-05-29}}</ref> Darunavir in combination with HIV polymerase inhibitors is recommended as a first line treatment option for treatment naive persons with HIV infection<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/contentfiles/lvguidelines/adultandadolescentgl.pdf |title=aidsinfo.nih.gov |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> but etravirine is approved only for use in treatment-experienced patients, owing in part to its requirement for twice-daily dosing.

The company's CNS products include the ADHD drug Concerta ([[methylphenidate]] extended release), and the long-acting injectable antipsychotics Invega Sustenna ([[paliperidone palmitate]]) and Risperdal Consta ([[risperidone]]). Invega Sustenna and Risperdal Consta were the first widely utilized long-acting depot injections for the treatment of schizophrenia.  Designed to address the issue of poor patient compliance with oral therapy, they are administered by intramuscular injection at intervals of 2 weeks and one month, respectively.  Only minimal improvements in outcomes relative to the oral versions of these drugs were observed in the clinical trial setting, but some evidence suggests that the advantages of long-acting injections in clinical practice may be greater than is readily demonstrated in the environment of a clinical trial.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaplan G, Casoy J, Zummo J |title=Impact of long-acting injectable antipsychotics on medication adherence and clinical, functional, and economic outcomes of schizophrenia |journal=Patient Prefer Adherence |volume=7 |issue= |pages=1171–80 |year=2013 |pmid=24265549 |pmc=3833623 |doi=10.2147/PPA.S53795 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kane JM, Kishimoto T, Correll CU |title=Assessing the comparative effectiveness of long-acting injectable vs. oral antipsychotic medications in the prevention of relapse provides a case study in comparative effectiveness research in psychiatry |journal=J Clin Epidemiol |volume=66 |issue=8 Suppl |pages=S37–41 |date=August 2013  |pmid=23849151 |doi=10.1016/j.jclinepi.2013.01.012 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fusar-Poli P, Kempton MJ, Rosenheck RA |title=Efficacy and safety of second-generation long-acting injections in schizophrenia: a meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials |journal=Int Clin Psychopharmacol |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=57–66 |date=March 2013  |pmid=23165366 |doi=10.1097/YIC.0b013e32835b091f |url=}}</ref>

=== 2010 hip-replacement recall ===
{{Main|2010 DePuy Hip Recall}}
On August 2009, 2010, DePuy, a subsidiary of American giant Johnson & Johnson, recalled its ASR (articular surface replacement) hip prostheses from the market. DePuy said the recall was due to unpublished National Joint Registry data showing a 12% revision rate for resurfacing at five years and an ASR XL revision rate of 13%. All hip prostheses fail in some patients, but it is expected that the rate will be about 1% a year.<ref name="Out of joint">{{cite news | url = http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.d2905.full | title = Out of joint: The story of the ASR | date = May 14, 2011 | author=Deborah Cohen }}</ref>
Pathologically, the failing prosthesis had several effects. Metal debris from wear of the implant led to a reaction that destroyed the soft tissues surrounding the joint, leaving some patients with long term disability. Ions of cobalt and chromium—the metals from which the implant was made—were also released into the blood and cerebral spinal fluid in some patients.<ref name="fda1">{{cite news | url = http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/ImplantsandProsthetics/MetalonMetalHipImplants/ucm241604.htm | title = FDA.

In March 2013, a jury in Los Angeles ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay more than $8.3 million in damages to a Montana man in the first of more than 10,000 lawsuits pending against the company in connection with the now-recalled DePuy hip.<ref name="Meier">{{cite news|last=Meier|first=Barry|title=J.&J.

=== Use of the Red Cross symbol ===
[[File:Flag of the Red Cross.svg|thumb|150px|Flag of the [[Red Cross]]]]

{{further|Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement#Use of the emblems}}
Johnson & Johnson registered the Red Cross as a U.S. trademark for "medicinal and surgical plasters" in 1905 and has used the design since 1887.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=71013666|title=Trademark Status & Document Retrieval|work=uspto.gov}}</ref> The [[Geneva Conventions]], which reserved the [[Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement#Red Cross|Red Cross emblem]] for specific uses, were first approved in 1864 and ratified by the United States in 1882. However, the emblem was not protected by U.S. law for the use of the [[American Red Cross]] and the U.S. military until after Johnson & Johnson had obtained its trademark. A clause in this law (now 18 U.S.C. 706) permits this pre-existing uses of the Red Cross to continue.

<!-- Please do NOT insert any further assertions that continued Johnson & Johnson use of the Red Cross violates the Geneva Conventions; as a the paragraph below states, the U.S. specifically excluded that application of the Geneva Conventions thru a reservation. -->
A declaration made by the U.S. upon its ratification of the 1949 Geneva Conventions includes a [[Reservation (law)|reservation]] that pre-1905 U.S. domestic uses of the Red Cross, such as Johnson & Johnson's, would remain lawful as long as the cross is not used on "aircraft, vessels, vehicles, buildings or other structures, or upon the ground," i.e., uses which could be confused with its military uses.<ref>[http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/NORM/D6B53F5B5D14F35AC1256402003F9920?OpenDocument U.S. reservations to the 1949 Geneva Conventions] ([[International Committee of the Red Cross]] website)</ref> This means that the U.S. did not agree to any interpretation of the 1949 Geneva Conventions that would overrule Johnson & Johnson's trademark. The American Red Cross continues to recognize the validity of Johnson & Johnson's trademark.<ref>[http://www.redcross.org/pressrelease/0,1077,0_314_6910,00.html American Red Cross Defends Use of Emblem and Mission] ([[American Red Cross]] press release, August 10, 2007)</ref>

In August 2007, Johnson & Johnson filed a lawsuit against the [[American Red Cross]] (ARC), demanding that the charity halt the use of the red cross symbol on products it sells to the public, though the company takes no issue with the charity's use of the mark for non-profit purposes.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118662527980592590 "Red Cross Is Sued by J&J Over Signature Emblem"] ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' August 9, 2007</ref> In May 2008, the judge in the case dismissed most of Johnson & Johnson's claims, and a month later the two organizations announced a settlement had been reached in which both parties would continue to use the symbol.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/18/business/18cross.html | title = Claim Over Red Cross Symbol Is Settled |work=The New York Times | date = June 18, 2008 | author=Stephanie  Saul }}</ref>

=== Patent-infringement case against Abbott ===
In 2007, Johnson & Johnson sued [[Abbott Laboratories]] over the development and sale of the arthritis drug [[Humira]]. Johnson & Johnson claimed that Abbott used technology patented by [[New York University]] and licensed exclusively to Johnson & Johnson's [[Centocor]] division to develop Humira. Johnson & Johnson won the court case, and in 2009 Abbott was ordered to pay Johnson & Johnson $1.17&nbsp;billion in lost revenues and $504&nbsp;million in royalties.<ref name=Bloomberg2009>[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aF0Qoxe0JCiw Abbott Told to Pay Record $1.67&nbsp;billion Award to J&J], ''Bloomberg News'', June 29, 2009</ref> The judge also added $175.6&nbsp;million in interest to bring the total to $1.84&nbsp;billion.<ref name= bloomberg2010>[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-02/abbott-challenges-1-67-billion-patent-loss-to-j-j-over-arthritis-therapy.html Abbott Challenges $1.67&nbsp;billion Patent Loss to J&J Over Humira], ''Bloomberg News'', November 2, 2010</ref> This was the largest patent-infringement award in U.S. history<ref name=Bloomberg2009/> until the 2013 decision against Teva in favor of Takeda and Pfizer for over 2.1 billion dollars.<ref name= WSJ2013>[https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324188604578541080995659790 Pfizer, Takeda to Get $2.15 Billion Settlement], ''WSJ'', 6 12 2013</ref>  Abbott has since successfully reversed the verdict at appeal.<ref name= BusinessWeek2011>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-02-23/abbott-wins-reversal-of-j-j-s-1-67-billion-patent-victory.html|title=Bloomberg Business|work=Bloomberg.com}}</ref>

===Vaginal mesh implants===
Tens of thousands of women worldwide have taken legal action against Johnson & Johnson after suffering serious complications following a vaginal mesh implant procedure.<ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/states-file-lawsuit-against-johnson-johnson-over-pelvic-mesh-implants/</ref> In 2016 the U.S. states of California and Washington filed a lawsuit against the company, accusing it of deception.<ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/states-file-lawsuit-against-johnson-johnson-over-pelvic-mesh-implants/</ref> More than 700 women began a [[class action]] against the company in the [[Federal Court of Australia]] in 2017, telling the court they "suffered irreparable, debilitating pain after the devices began to erode into surrounding tissue and organs, causing infections and complications." The class action alleged that Johnson & Johnson, which "aggressively marketed" the implants "failed to properly warn patients and surgeons of the risk, or test the devices adequately."<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jul/04/vaginal-mesh-risks-downplayed-by-johnson-johnson-court-told</ref>

===Baby powder===
In February 2016, J&J was ordered to pay $72 million in damages to the family of Jacqueline Fox, a 62-year-old woman who died of ovarian cancer in 2015.<ref name=BBC>{{cite news|title=Johnson & Johnson hit with $72m damages in talc-cancer case|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-35648252|accessdate=24 February 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=24 February 2016}}</ref> She had been sprinkling Johnson's [[Baby Powder]] on her underwear nearly every day since she was a teenager. J&J claimed that the safety of cosmetic talc is supported by decades of scientific evidence and it plans to appeal the verdict. The British charity, [[Ovacome]] was quoted as saying that while there were 16 studies which showed that using talc increased the risk of ovarian cancer by around a third and that a 2013 review of US studies came up with similar results for genital, but not general talcum powder use, J&J were not convinced that the results were reliable. Furthermore, Ovacome said, "[[Ovarian cancer]] is a rare disease, and increasing a small risk by a third still [still] gives a small risk."<ref name=BBC/>

By March 2017, over 1,000 U.S. women had sued J&J for covering up the possible cancer risk from its Baby Powder product; the company says that 70 percent of its Baby Powder is used by adults.<ref>[https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-baby-powder-cancer-lawsuits/ Johnson & Johnson Has a Baby Powder Problem] Bloomberg, Retrieved April 20, 2017.</ref>

On August 21, 2017, a California jury ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $417 million to a woman who claimed she developed ovarian cancer after using the company's talc-based products like Johnson's Baby Powder for feminine hygiene. The verdict included $70 million in compensatory damages and $347 million in punitive damages. J&J says they will appeal the verdict, believing that science supports the safety of their baby powder. <ref>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-johnson-johnson-cancer-lawsuit-idUSKCN1B121D</ref>
