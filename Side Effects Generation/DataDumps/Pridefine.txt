'''Pridefine''' ('''AHR-1,118''') is a [[drug]] which was investigated as an [[antidepressant]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but was never marketed.<ref name="pmid7426062">{{cite journal |vauthors=Vosmer G, DeMet EM, Halaris AE | title = Action of the antidepressant pridefine (AHR-1118) on biogenic amines in the rat brain | journal = [[Biochemical Pharmacology (journal)|Biochemical Pharmacology]] | volume = 29 | issue = 19 | pages = 2557–62 |date=1980 | pmid = 7426062 | doi = 10.1016/0006-2952(80)90066-0}}</ref> It acts as a balanced [[reuptake inhibitor]] of [[serotonin]], [[dopamine]], and [[norepinephrine]], and also has some weak [[releasing agent|releasing]] activity.<ref name="pmid7426062"/><ref name="pmid7406986">{{cite journal |vauthors=Halaris AE, Demet EM | title = Open trial evaluation of a pyrrolidine derivative (AHR-1118) on norepinephrine metabolism | journal = [[Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology]] | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 43–9 | year = 1980 | pmid = 7406986 | doi = 10.1016/0364-7722(80)90060-0}}</ref><ref name="pmid7205281">{{cite journal |vauthors=DeMet EM, Vosmer G, Halaris AE | title = Noncompetitive amine uptake inhibition by the new antidepressant pridefine | journal = [[Journal of Neurochemistry]] | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 917–23 |date=1981 | pmid = 7205281 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-4159.1981.tb01682.x }}</ref>

In [[clinical trial]]s pridefine was found to be as efficacious as the [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s [[amitriptyline]] and [[imipramine]] in the treatment of [[major depressive disorder]] but was much more [[tolerability|tolerable]] in comparison and also had an earlier [[onset of action]].<ref name="pmid7426062"/> It has been shown to be effective in the treatment of [[alcoholism]] as well.<ref name="pmid7426062"/>
