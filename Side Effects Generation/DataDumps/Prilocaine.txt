'''Prilocaine''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|r|aɪ|l|ə|ˌ|k|eɪ|n}}{{refn|{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|accessdate=2016-01-21|Prilocaine}}}}) is a [[local anesthetic]] of the [[amino]] [[amide]] type first prepared by [[Claes Tegner]] and [[Nils Löfgren]].  In its [[parenteral|injectable]] form (trade name '''Citanest'''), it is often used in [[dentistry]].  It is also often combined with lidocaine as a topical preparation for dermal anesthesia ([[lidocaine/prilocaine]] or [[EMLA]]), for treatment of conditions like [[paresthesia]].  As it has low cardiac toxicity, it is commonly used for [[intravenous regional anaesthesia]] (IVRA). 

== Contraindications ==
In some patients, ortho-toluidine, a metabolite of prilocaine, may cause [[methemoglobinemia]], which may be treated with [[methylene blue]].  Prilocaine may also be contraindicated in people with [[sickle cell anemia]], [[anemia]], or symptomatic [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Practical and Professional Clinical Skills|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_DY5PCOFH4EC&pg=PA267|publisher = Oxford University Press|date = 2011-09-15|isbn = 9780199585618|first = Vinod|last = Patel|first2 = John|last2 = Morrissey|page = 267}}</ref>

People with [[pseudocholinesterase deficiency]] may have difficulty metabolizing this anesthetic.

== Combinations ==
It is given as a [[Local anesthetic with vasoconstrictor|combination with the vasoconstrictor]] [[epinephrine]] under the trade name ''Citanest Forte''.

It is used as an [[eutectic]] mixture with [[lidocaine]], 50% w/w, as [[lidocaine/prilocaine]]. The mixture is an oil with a melting point of 18°C. A 5% [[emulsion]] preparation, containing 2.5% each of lidocaine/prilocaine, is marketed by [[APP Pharmaceuticals]] under the [[trade name]] '''EMLA''' (an abbreviation for '''Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics''').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/704761_2 |title=Topical Anesthesia Use in Children: Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics |publisher=Medscape.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-07}}</ref>
