===Climate===
[[File:Almora after rain sunlight.jpg|thumb|view of Almora after rains]]
The climate of Almora is characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year. The main seasons are summer from March to June, the [[monsoon]] season from July to November and winter from December to February. In summer, Almora is largely under the influence of moist, maritime airflow from the western side of the subtropical anticyclonic cells over low-latitude ocean waters. Temperatures are high and can lead to warm, oppressive nights. Summers are usually somewhat wetter than winters, with much of the rainfall coming from convectional thunderstorm activity; tropical cyclones also enhance warm-season rainfall in some regions. The coldest month is usually quite mild, although frosts are not uncommon, and winter precipitation is derived primarily from frontal cyclones along the polar front. The [[Köppen climate classification]] subtype for this climate is ''Cwa'' (Humid Subtropical Climate).<ref>{{cite web|title=Climate: Almora - Temperature, Climate graph, Climate table - Climate-Data.org|url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/24758/|website=en.climate-data.org|accessdate=31 August 2016}}</ref>

===Flora and fauna===
[[File:Forests and Valley of Uttarakhand India (2).jpg|thumb|Forests in Almora over hills]]
The region is immensely rich with 4000 species of plants, having remarkable diversity in its natural vegetation by virtue of its being at a great range of elevation. In addition to its climatic variations, particularly in temperature and precipitation associated with the alignment and altitudes of ranges and nature of valleys, determine the altitudinal growth and variety of vegetation. The flora of this region may be classified into tropical, Himalayan sub-tropical and sub alpine and alpine vegetation. The alpine and sub alpine zones are considered as the most natural abode of the largest number of medicinal plants.

The sub-alpine zones of Almora and outskirts are a natural sanctuary for [[leopard]], [[Langur]], [[Himalayan black bear]], [[kakar]], [[goral]] etc. Whereas the high altitude zones abound [[musk deer]], popularly called "Kastura Mrig", [[snow leopard]], [[blue sheep]], thar etc. The entire zone is rich in a remarkable variety of birds possessing plumage of magnificent design and colours like [[peacock]], which include [[Grey Quail]], Kala Titar, [[Whistling thrush]], [[Chakor]], [[Monal]], [[cheer pheasant]], koklas pheasant etc.
