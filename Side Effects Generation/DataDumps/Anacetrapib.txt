==Clinical trials==
At the 16th International Symposium on Drugs Affecting Lipid Metabolism (New York, Oct 4-7, 2007), Merck reported on a Phase IIb study. The eight-week study reported dosage correlated reduction in LDL-C and increases in HDL-C levels with no corresponding increases in blood pressure in any cohort. The increase in HDL was particularly significant, averaging 44 percent, 86 percent, 139 percent and 133 percent at doses of 10&nbsp;mg, 40&nbsp;mg, 150&nbsp;mg and 300&nbsp;mg.

Merck performed a dose-ranging study of anacetrapib,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00325455?term=NCT00325455&rank=1 | title = MK0859 Dose-Ranging Study | publisher = clinicaltrials.gov}}</ref> with the results presented in 2009.<ref>{{cite journal

A 2013 study of 407 Japanese patients found anacetrapib reduced LDL and raised HDL alone or with atorvastatin.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Efficacy and safety of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor anacetrapib in Japanese patients with dyslipidemia.|date = Sep 2013|journal = Atherosclerosis|doi = 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2013.05.012|pmid = 23958252 |volume=230 |pages=52–60}}</ref>

A concern raised in October 2013 is related to the time that the drug remains in people's bodies after they stop taking it. The report shows that even after 4 years the levels of the medicine were still detectable.<ref>{{cite web | title= Merck heart drug runs into a new worry | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2013/10/22/merck-heart-drug-runs-into-new-worry/ | author= Matthew Herper| publisher = Forbes.com |date=October 22, 2013}}</ref>

A 2014 study found HDL and drug levels remained elevated 2 to 4 years after discontinuation.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Evaluation of lipids, drug concentration, and safety parameters following cessation of treatment with the cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor anacetrapib in patients with or at high risk for coronary heart disease. |date = 2014-01-01|journal = The American Journal of Cardiology|doi = 10.1016/j.amjcard.2013.08.041 |pmid = 24188894 |volume=113 |pages=76–83}}</ref>

Early results from the DEFINE trial were presented on November 17 at AHA2010, a meeting of the [[American Heart Association]]. At 100&nbsp;mg dosage, LDL decreased by 36%, lipoprotein(a) decreased by 36.4%, while HDL increased by 138%. Systolic blood pressure showed no increase, and there was no association with increased CVD death or events.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1009744

Cardiologist [[Steven Nissen|Steve Nissen]] (in 2010) described DEFINE as a medium-sized safety trial intended to find out "whether anacetrapib would show the same increase in adverse cardiovascular events that was seen with torcetrapib." Fortunately, anacetrapib did not.  In his opinion the DEFINE study was too small to show a clear benefit, but the trends in the major adverse cardiovascular events were going in the right direction.<ref>{{cite web | title=DEFINE: Large effects on LDL and HDL cholesterol with CETP inhibitor anacetrapib | url=http://www.theheart.org/article/1151979.do|author =O'Riordan, Michael|publisher = theheart.org

A two-year follow up is due to complete by December 2012.{{update after|2013}} <!-- doesnt show ! -->

{{as of|March 2016}} the trial is due to complete in November 2017.<ref name=NCT00685776/>

===Phase III trial (REVEAL)===
The REVEAL (Randomized EValuation of the Effects of Anacetrapib Through Lipid-modification) will assess whether there is clinical benefit associated with anacetrapib. REVEAL recruited 30,000 participants<ref>{{cite web|title=HPS3/TIMI55 – REVEAL trial of Anacetrapib in high-risk vascular patients recruits the target of 30,000 participants |url=http://www.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/news/REVEAL%20Press%20Release%2002%20September%202013.pdf |publisher=University of Oxford Clinical Trial Service Unit & Epidemiological Studies Unit |date=September 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203022217/http://www.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/news/REVEAL%20Press%20Release%2002%20September%202013.pdf |archivedate=December 3, 2013 }}</ref> for a [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial]].

The study will compare patients with a history of vascular disease (such as heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease) on 100&nbsp;mg of anacetrapib daily to those on placebo, to determine if the addition of anacetrapib reduces the risk of major coronary events (defined as the composite of coronary death, myocardial infarction, and coronary revascularization).<ref>{{cite web | title= REVEAL: Randomized EValuation of the Effects of Anacetrapib Through Lipid-modification | url=http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01252953?term=reveal&rank=1 | author=National Institute of Health | publisher = clinicaltrials.gov |date=January 30, 2012}}</ref>

On June 27, 2017, Merck announced that anacetrapib met its primary endpoint of significantly reducing major coronary events in patients who were already receiving an effective LDL-C lowering regimen. This "REVEAL" study was published on September 28 2017 in the New England Journal of Medicine. The authors propose benefit in non-fatal events but there was no benefit in coronary deaths (P-value 0.25) or in overall mortality (P-value 0.46) with 7.5 ± 0.1% of over 30,000 patients dying regardless.

Other CETP inhibitors:
*[[Torcetrapib]] was developed by [[Pfizer]] until December 2006 but caused unacceptable increases in blood pressure and had net cardiovascular detriment.
*[[Dalcetrapib]] was developed by [[Hoffmann–La Roche]] until May 2012.  It did not raise blood pressure and did raise HDL, but it showed no clinically meaningful efficacy.
*[[Evacetrapib]] was developed by [[Eli Lilly & Company]] until October 2015.
