'''Premazepam''' is a [[benzodiazepine]] derivative.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Drug Metab Dispos |date=Mar–Apr 1984 | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 257–63 | title = Metabolic fate of premazepam, a new anti-anxiety drug, in the rat and the dog | author = Assandri A |author2=Barone D |author3=Ferrari P |author4=Perazzi A |author5=Ripamonti A |author6=Tuan G |author7=Zerilli LF  | pmid = 6144494}}</ref> It is a [[partial agonist]] of [[benzodiazepine]] receptors and was shown in 1984 to possess both [[anxiolytic]] and [[sedative]] properties in humans but was never marketed.

==Properties==
The initial doses of premazepam given to human test subjects demonstrated similar psychological test results to those produced by diazepam. It was also demonstrated that initial dosing with premazepam produces similar sedative effects as compared with diazepam, although psychomotor impairments are greater with premazepam than with diazepam after initial dosing. However, with repeated dosing for more than one day premazepam causes less sedation and less psychomotor impairment than [[diazepam]]. Premazepam possesses [[sedative]] and [[anxiolytic]] properties. Premazepam produces more slow wave and less fast wave [[EEG]] changes than [[diazepam]]. Tests have shown that 7.5&nbsp;mg of premazepam is approximately equivalent to 5&nbsp;mg of [[diazepam]].<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Br J Clin Pharmacol |date=August 1984 | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 127–33 | title = The psychopharmacological effects of premazepam, diazepam and placebo in healthy human subjects | author = Golombok S |author2=Lader M | pmid = 6148956 | pmc = 1463527 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.1984.tb02444.x}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==
Premazepam is a [[pyrrolodiazepine]] benzodiazepine and acts as a partial [[agonist]] at benzodiazepine receptors. The mean time taken to reach peak plasma levels is 2 hours and the mean half life of premazepam in humans is 11.5 hours. About 90% of the drug is excreted in unchanged form. Of the remaining 10% of the drug none of the metabolites showed any pharmacological activity. Thus premazepam produces no [[active metabolites]] in humans.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther Toxicol |date=May 1984 | volume = 22 | issue = 5 | pages = 273–7 | title = Pharmacokinetics and metabolism of premazepam, a new potential anxiolytic, in humans | author = Vitiello B |author2=Buniva G |author3=Bernareggi A |author4=Assandri A |author5=Perazzi A |author6=Fuccella LM |author7=Palumbo R  | pmid = 6146571}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | journal = Psychopharmacology | year = 1985 | volume = 86 | issue = 4 | pages = 464–7 | title = In vivo interaction of premazepam with benzodiazepine receptors: relation to its pharmacological effects | author = Mennini T |author2=Barone D |author3=Gobbi M  | pmid = 2863844 | doi = 10.1007/BF00427909}}</ref>
