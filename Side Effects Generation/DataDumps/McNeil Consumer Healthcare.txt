'''McNeil Consumer Healthcare''' is an American medicals products company belonging to the [[Johnson & Johnson]] [[Health care|healthcare]] products group.

==History==
The company was founded on March 16, 1879 by 23-year-old Robert McNeil, who paid $167 for a [[Pharmacy|drugstore]] complete with fixtures, inventory and [[soda fountain]], as a retail [[pharmacy]], in the [[Kensington, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Kensington]] section of [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], United States. Robert McNeil was a graduate of the [[Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science]] ([[University of the Sciences in Philadelphia]]).

In 1904, one of McNeil's sons, Robert Lincoln McNeil, became part of the company and together they created '''McNeil Laboratories''' in 1933. The company would focus on [[direct marketing]] of prescription drugs to hospitals, pharmacists, and doctors. Development of [[acetaminophen]] began under the leadership of [[Robert L. McNeil, Jr.]], who later served as the firm's chairman.<ref>{{cite news|last=Singer|first=Natasha|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/04/business/04mcneil.html?pagewanted=print|title=Robert L. McNeil Jr., Chemist Who Introduced Tylenol, Dies at 94|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 3, 2010|accessdate=June 4, 2010}}</ref> In 1953 McNeil Laboratories introduced Algoson, a preparation containing [[acetaminophen]] together with sodium [[butabarbital]], a [[sedative]]. In 1955, McNeil Laboratories introduced Tylenol Elixir for children, containing only acetaminophen.

In 1959, [[Johnson & Johnson]] acquired McNeil Laboratories and a year later the company was able to sell [[Tylenol (brand)|Tylenol]] for the first time ever, without a prescription. In 1961, the company moved into its [[Fort Washington, Pennsylvania]] headquarters. Along with its Fort Washington plant, McNeil also has plants worldwide.

In 1977, two companies were created: McNeil medicals products and McNeil Consumer Products Company or McNeil Consumer Healthcare. The focus of McNeil medicals products is to market prescription drugs. In 1993 McNeil medicals products merged with the [[Ortho Pharmaceutical]] to form [[Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical]].

In 2001, McNeil Consumer Healthcare changed its name to '''McNeil Consumer & Specialty medicals products'''. However, it was changed again and is now known as "McNeil Consumer Healthcare".

As part of Procter & Gamble's acquisition of Gillette in 2005, Procter & Gamble's Gillette was required by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] to divest itself of [[Rembrandt toothpaste]].<ref name="adage1">{{cite web|url=http://adage.com/article/news/johnson-johnson-buy-rembrandt-oral-care-line/47173/ |title=Johnson & Johnson To Buy Rembrandt Oral Care Line |publisher=Advertising Age|author=Jack Neff |date=October 24, 2005 |accessdate=April 12, 2014}}</ref>  Consequently, it sold Rembrandt to [[Johnson & Johnson]]'s  McNeil-PPC division.<ref name="adage1"/>

The company markets [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] and [[Prescription drug|prescription]] medicals products including complete lines of [[Tylenol (brand)|Tylenol]] and [[Motrin]] IB ([[ibuprofen]]) products for adults and children. The company is located in [[Fort Washington, Pennsylvania]], and currently employs 2,600 people. Annual sales in 2004 were US $2.1 billion. McNeil's Canadian head office is in [[Markham, Ontario]].

==McNeil Nutritionals==
'''McNeil Nutritionals, LLC''' markets and sells a range of products including [[Lactaid]], the branded [[sucralose]] sweetener [[Splenda]], and [[Benecol]] in the UK, Ireland, Belgium, and in the US under license from [[Raisio Group]].

In June 2007, McNeil became involved in lawsuits with [[Merisant]], the makers of the artificial sweetener [[Equal (sweetener)|Equal]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Artificial Sweetener Rivals Renew a Heated Court Fight|author=Browning, Lynnley|date=June 8, 2007|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/08/business/08sour.html}}</ref> It also produced a sweetener made with [[stevia]] and cane [[Table sugar|sugar]], marketed as Sun Crystals.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In 2012, it started to sell a [[monk fruit]]-based sweetener called [[Nectresse]].<ref name="Adams2012">Christopher Adams (Aug 28, 2012), [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=10829886 US launch sweet news for kiwi supplier], ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]''</ref>

==Johnson & Johnson Merck Joint Venture==
Known as the "JV," this 50/50 [[joint venture]] between [[Johnson & Johnson]] and [[Merck & Co.|Merck]] handled the OTC product lines [[Pepcid]], [[Mylanta]], and [[Mylicon]] and is located at the McNeil Consumer Healthcare headquarters in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania.

In September 2011, however, the JV ended, when Merck sold its 50 percent interest in the joint venture.  Merck said it sold its interest in the joint venture so it could focus on building the consumer products division it gained through its [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisition]] of [[Schering-Plough]] in 2009. By terminating the joint venture, Merck said it will have greater freedom to exploit opportunities to switch prescription medicines to over-the-counter products that can be purchased without a doctorâ€™s prescription. As a result, all former Johnson & Johnson-Merck products are now handled by McNeil Consumer Healthcare.
