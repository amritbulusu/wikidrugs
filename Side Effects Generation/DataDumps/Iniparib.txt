==History==
Iniparib was the first putative PARP inhibitor to commence [[Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_III|phase III clinical trial]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.p-d-r.com/ranking/Wolters%20Kluwer%20Health/July09/PARPi.WKHealth.29Jul09.pdf |title=PARP Inhibitors in Oncology.

In 2009, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] began [[Fast track (FDA)|fast-tracking]] the [[new drug application]] of iniparib for triple-negative breast cancer. However, phase III results disclosed in January 2011 were disappointing.<ref name="fiercebiotech">{{cite web |url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/sanofi-breast-cancer-drug-flunks-phase-iii-trial/2011-01-27 |title=Sanofi breast cancer drug flunks Phase III trial}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/32/34/3840.abstract |authors=Joyce O'Shaughnessy, Lee Schwartzberg, Michael A.

Iniparib was also studied as a potential chemotherapeutic agent in the fight against malignant [[glioma]], including [[glioblastoma]]. Glioma is a resilient type of primary brain tumor (not metastatic) that currently has limited effective therapies, especially for patients whose tumors are in an inoperable location of the brain, such as the interior of the brainstem.

During the 2013 [[American Society of Clinical Oncology]] conference, [[Sanofi]] disclosed that iniparib failed to help lung-cancer patients in a late-stage trial, prompting the company to end research into the once-promising compound and take a $285 million charge.<ref name=fiercebiotech/><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-03/sanofi-ends-iniparib-research-plans-285-million-charge.html | title = Sanofi Ends Iniparib Research}}</ref>
