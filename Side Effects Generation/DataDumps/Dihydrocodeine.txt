'''Dihydrocodeine''' is a semi-[[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] prescribed for pain or severe [[dyspnea]], or as an [[antitussive]], either alone or compounded with [[paracetamol]] (as in [[co-dydramol]]) or [[aspirin]]. It was developed in Germany in 1908 and first marketed in 1911.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qoyYobgX0uwC|title=Encyclopedia of Psychopharmacology|last=Stolerman|first=Ian|date=2010-07-31|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9783540686989|language=en}}</ref>

Commonly available as tablets, solutions, elixirs, and other oral forms, dihydrocodeine is also available in some countries as an injectable solution for deep subcutaneous and intra-muscular administration. As with [[codeine]], intravenous administration should be avoided, as it could result in [[anaphylaxis]] and life-threatening [[pulmonary edema]]. In the past, dihydrocodeine suppositories were used. Dihydrocodeine is available in suppository form on prescription.

Dihydrocodeine is used as an alternative or adjunct to codeine for the aforementioned indications.  It is available as the following salts, in approximate descending order of frequency of use:  bitartrate, phosphate, hydrochloride, tartrate, hydroiodide, methyliodide, hydrobromide, sulfate, and thiocyanate.  The salt to free base conversion factors are 0.67 for the bitartrate, 0.73 for the phosphate, and 0.89 for the hydrochloride.

Dihydrocodeine was developed during the intense international search for more effective antitussives, especially to help reduce the airborne spread of tuberculosis, pertussis, pneumonia, and similar diseases, in the years from c.a. 1895 to 1915. It is similar in chemical structure to [[codeine]]. Dihydrocodeine is twice as strong as codeine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chu-toulouse.fr/IMG/pdf/12_table_conversion_palier_ii_et_iii_v5-2.pdf|title=Equivalence table (in French)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date= 6 March 2016}}</ref>  Although dihydrocodeine does have extremely active metabolites, in the form of [[dihydromorphine]] and dihydromorphine-6-glucuronide (one hundred times more potent), these metabolites are produced in such small amounts that they do not have clinically significant effects.<ref name="IntJClinPharmacolTher2003-Schmidt">{{cite journal |vauthors=Schmidt H, Vormfelde S, Walchner-Bonjean M, Klinder K, Freudenthaler S, Gleiter C, Gundert-Remy U, Skopp G, Aderjan R, Fuhr U |title=The role of active metabolites in dihydrocodeine effects |journal=Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=95–106 |year=2003 |pmid=12665158}}</ref>

Dihydrocodeine is also the original member and chemical base of a number of similar semi-synthetic [[opioid]]s such as acetyldihydrocodeine, dihydrocodeine enol acetate, dihydroisocodeine, [[nicocodeine]], and nicodicodeine.

== Indications ==
{{Medref|section|date=August 2015}}
Approved indication for dihydrocodeine is the management of moderate to moderately severe [[pain]] as well as coughing and shortness of breath.  As is the case with other drugs in this group, the [[antitussive]] dose tends to be less than the [[analgesic]] dose, and dihydrocodeine is a powerful cough suppressant like all other members of the immediate codeine family (see below) and their cousins [[hydrocodone]], [[oxycodone]] and [[ethylmorphine]], whole opium preparations, and the strong opioid [[hydromorphone]].

For use against pain, dihydrocodeine is usually formulated as tablets or capsules containing 15–16&nbsp;mg or 30–32&nbsp;mg with or without other active ingredients such as aspirin, paracetamol (acetaminophen), [[ibuprofen]], or others.

Controlled-release dihydrocodeine is available for both pain and coughing, as indicated below, as waxy tablets containing 60 to 120&nbsp;mg of the drug. Some formulations, intended for use against coughing and the like, have other active ingredients such as antihistamines, decongestants and others. 
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Dhccontinus.jpg|thumb|Box of 56 controlled release 60mg dihydrocodeine tablets. 2 tablets a day=one month dosage (28 days)]] -->
Other oral formulations, such as packets of effervescent powder, sublingual drops, elixirs and the like are also available in many locations.

Injectable dihydrocodeine is most often given as a deep subcutaneous shot.

== Preparations and availability ==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
[[File:Dihydrcodeine Tablets Package Almus 30 mg 2017.jpg|thumb|Package of 100 Dihydrocodeine Tablets]]
Dihydrocodeine products which can be purchased over the counter in many European and Pacific Rim countries generally contain from 2 to 20&nbsp;mg of dihydrocodeine per dosing unit combined with one or more other active ingredients such as paracetamol (acetaminophen), aspirin, ibuprofen, antihistamines, decongestants, vitamins, medicinal herb preparations, and other such ingredients.  In a subset of these countries and foreign possessions, 30&nbsp;mg tablets and 60&nbsp;mg controlled-release tablets are available over the counter and chemists may very well be able to dispense the 90 and 120&nbsp;mg strengths at their discretion.

In the United States, the most common analgesic brands with dihydrocodeine are: DHC Plus (16 and 32&nbsp;mg), Panlor SS (32&nbsp;mg), ZerLor (32&nbsp;mg), Panlor DC (16&nbsp;mg) and Synalgos DC (16&nbsp;mg).  These combination products also include paracetamol (acetaminophen) and [[caffeine]].  Aspirin is used in the case of Synalgos DC.

Dihydrocodeine is sometimes marketed in combination preparations with paracetamol as [[co-dydramol]] ([[British Approved Name|BAN]]) to provide greater pain relief than either agent used singly (see [[Synergy#Examples|examples of synergy]]).

In the UK and other countries, 30&nbsp;mg tablets containing only dihydrocodeine as the active ingredient are available, also a 40&nbsp;mg Dihydrocodeine tablet is available in the UK as DF-118 Forte.

The original dihydrocodeine product, Paracodin, is an elixir of dihydrocodeine hydroiodide also available as a Tussionex-style suspension in many European countries.

In many European countries and elsewhere in the world, the most commonly found dihydrocodeine preparations are extended-release tablets made by encasing granules of the ingredient mixture, almost always using the bitartrate salt of dihydrocodeine, of four different sizes in a wax-based binder.  The usual strengths are 60, 90, and 120&nbsp;mg.  Common trade names for the extended-release tablets are Didor Continus, Codidol, Codi-Contin, Dicodin (made in France and the major product containing the tartrate salt), Contugesic, DHC, and DHC Continus.

Dihydrocodeine is available in Japan as tablets which contain 2.5&nbsp;mg of dihydrocodeine phosphate and caffeine, the decongestant [[N-Methylephedrine|d,l-methylephedrine HCl]], and the antihistamine [[chlorpheniramine]], and packets of granules which effervesce like Alka-Seltzer with 10&nbsp;mg of dihydrocodeine with [[lysozyme]] and chlorpheniramine, marketed for OTC sale as New Bron Solution-ACE.  These two formulations may have once contained [[phenyltoloxamine]] citrate as the antihistamine component.

<!-- for want of a section, group manufacture 'ads' here ??--> 
Elsewhere in the Pacific Rim, Dicogesic in analogous to Glaxo/Smith-Kline's DF-118.

The manufacturer of New Bron Solution-ACE; SS Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, also markets an ibuprofen with dihydrocodeine product called S.Tac EVE, which also includes d,l-methylephedrine HCl, chlorpheniramine, anhydrous caffeine, and vitamins B1 and C. 
 
The Panlor series is manufactured by Pan-American Laboratories of Covington, Louisiana, and they also market several dihydrocodeine-based prescription cough syrups in the United States.

== Side effects ==
{{Medref|section|date=August 2015}}
As with other opioids, tolerance and physical and psychological [[Drug addiction|dependence]] develop with repeated dihydrocodeine use. All opioids can impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery if taken in large doses.

Itching and flushing and other effects of blood vessel dilation are also common side-effects, due to histamine release in response to the drug using one or more types of receptors in the CNS or other responses elsewhere in the body.  First-generation antihistamines such as [[tripelennamine]] (Pyrabenzamine), [[clemastine]] (Tavist), [[hydroxyzine]] (Atarax), [[diphenhydramine]] (Benadryl), [[cyproheptadine]] (Periactin), [[brompheniramine]] (Dimetapp), [[chlorphenamine]] (Chlor-Trimeton), [[doxylamine]] (NyQuil) and [[phenyltoloxamine]] (Percogesic Original Formula) not only combat the histamine-driven side-effects, but are analgesic-sparing (potentiating) in various degrees. The antihistamine [[promethazine]] (Phenergan) may also have a positive effect on hepatic metabolism of dihydrocodeine as it does with codeine. Higher doses of promethazine may interfere with most other opioids with the exception of the pethidine family (Demerol and the like) by this or other unknown mechanisms.

As with all drugs, side-effects depend on the person taking the medication. They can range in severity from mild to extreme, from headaches to difficulty breathing.

Constipation is the one side-effect of dihydrocodeine and almost all opioids which is near-universal.  It results from the slowing of peristalsis in the gut and is a reason dihydrocodeine, ethylmorphine, codeine, opium preparations, and morphine are used to stop diarrhoea and combat [[irritable bowel syndrome]] (IBS) in its diarrhoeal and cyclical forms as well as other conditions causing hypermotility or intestinal cramping. Opium/opioid preparations are used often as a last resort where pain is severe and the bowels are organically loose. It is generally better to treat IBS with a non psycho-tropic opioid such as loperamide hydrochloride which stays contained in the bowel, thereby not causing drowsy effects and allowing many people to work using machines etc. For IBS, hyoscine butylbromide ([[Butylscopolamine|Buscopan]] in the UK) and [[Mebeverine|mebeverine hydrochloride]] (Colofac) can be effective with or without an opium related compound.

== Regulation ==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}

; Australia : In [[Australia]], dihydrocodeine is a [[Over-the-counter_drug|OTC]] 'pharmacy medicine' [[Standard_for_the_Uniform_Scheduling_of_Medicines_and_Poisons#Schedule_2:_pharmacy_medicine|Schedule 2]] drug when compounded with [[aspirin]] and no other therapeutically active substance, not exceeding 5mg per tablet and a recommended dose of 10mg. No more than 25 dosage units are permitted under Schedule 2 regulation for dihydrocodeine. It is a 'pharmacist only' [[Standard_for_the_Uniform_Scheduling_of_Medicines_and_Poisons#Schedule_3:_pharmacist_only_medicine|Schedule 3]] drug when compounded with one or more other therapeutically active substances and not exceeding 15mg dihydrocodeine per dose. Schedule 3 drugs, while still OTC, can only be dispensed after consultation with a pharmacist. It is a [[Standard_for_the_Uniform_Scheduling_of_Medicines_and_Poisons#Schedule_4:_prescription_only_medicine|Schedule 4]] (prescription only) drug when compounded with one or more other therapeutically active substances and not exceeding 100mg dihydrocodeine per dose. Single ingredient dihydrocodeine preparations fall under [[Standard_for_the_Uniform_Scheduling_of_Medicines_and_Poisons#Schedule_8:_controlled_drug|Schedule 8]] regulation and require a government authorized, secure prescription.<ref>{{cite web|title=Poisons Standard November 2016|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2016L01638/Html/Text#_Toc450920897|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=29 December 2016}}</ref> 
In late 2016 the [[Therapeutic_Goods_Administration|TGA]] announced that from February 2018, all [[codeine]] and subsequently dihydrocodeine medicines currently being sold under Schedule 2 or 3 will become prescription only.<ref>{{cite web|title=Painkillers with codeine won't be available over the counter from 2018|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-20/codeine-painkillers-won't-be-available-over-the-counter-2018/8133996|website=ABC.net.au|accessdate=29 December 2016}}</ref>

; Hong Kong : In Hong Kong, dihydrocodeine is regulated under Schedule 1 of Hong Kong's Chapter 134 ''Dangerous Drugs Ordinance''. It can only be used legally by health professionals and for university research purposes. A pharmacist can dispense Dihydrocodeine when furnished with a doctors prescription. Anyone who supplies the substance without a prescription can be fined $10000 (HKD). The penalty for trafficking or manufacturing the substance is a $5,000,000 ([[Hong Kong dollar|HKD]]) fine and life imprisonment. Possession of the substance for consumption, without a licence from the Department of Health, is illegal and carries a $1,000,000 (HKD) fine or 7 years imprisonment.

; Japan : In Japan, dihydrocodeine is available without a prescription; used in cough medicines such as New Bron Solution-ACE.  Dihydrocodeine is used as an antitussive in many products as a Dextromethorphan alternative.  Medicines in Japan which contain dihydrocodeine are coupled with caffeine to offset the sedative effects and discourage recreational use.  Cough medicines containing dihydrocodeine are controlled similarly to dextromethrophan in the United States, in that its sale is strictly limited by purchase quantity and is restricted to persons 20 and older for purchase.

; United Kingdom : In the United Kingdom, dihydrocodeine is a [[List of controlled drugs in the United Kingdom#Class B drugs|Class B]] drug; but, it is available over-the-counter in small amounts (less than 8&nbsp;mg), when combined with [[paracetamol]] (see [[co-dydramol]]). Dihydrocodeine is listed in Schedule 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 whereby it is exempt from prohibition on possession provided that it is in the form of a single preparation not being designed for [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] and less than 100&nbsp;mg (calculated as [[free base]]) or with a total concentration less than 2.5% (calculated as [[free base]]). Illegal possession of dihydrocodeine can result in up to 5 years in prison or an unlimited fine.

; United States : In the USA, dihydrocodeine is a [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule II|Schedule II]] substance, although preparations containing small amounts of dihydrocodeine are classified as [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule III drugs|Schedule III]] or [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule V drugs|Schedule V]], depending on the concentration of dihydrocodeine relative to other active constituents, such as paracetamol (acetaminophen).  This scheduling is similar to the UK's.  The DEA's ACSCN for dihydrocodeine free base and all salts is 9120.  The 2013 annual aggregate manufacturing quota is 250 kilos.

International treaties and the controlled-substances laws of most countries, such as the German ''[[Betäubungsmittelgesetz]]'', regulate dihydrocodeine at the same level as codeine.  Dihydrocodeine-based pharmaceuticals are especially used where chronic pain patients are able to have essentially OTC access to them provided they are registered with the provincial or national government as such a patient.

Controlled-release dihydrocodeine is a non-prescription item in some places, especially the 60&nbsp;mg strength.  A report by the Ivo Šandor Organisation in 2004 listed Andorra, Spain, Gibraltar and Austria as having varying degrees of access to these and other dihydrocodeine, nicocodeine and codeine products.

== Chemistry ==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
Dihydrocodeine is the parent drug of a series of moderately strong narcotics including, among others, [[hydrocodone]], [[nicocodeine]], [[nicodicodeine]], [[thebaine]] and [[acetyldihydrocodeine]].

Whereas converting [[codeine]] to [[morphine]] is a difficult and unrewarding task, dihydrocodeine can be converted to [[dihydromorphine]] with very high yields (over 95%).  Dihydromorphine is widely used in Japan. The dihydromorphine can be quantitatively converted to [[hydromorphone]] using potassium tert butoxide.

Dihydrocodeine can be presumptively detected by the [[Froehde reagent]].

== Recreational use ==
As dihydrocodeine can provide a euphoric high when taken in higher-than-therapeutic doses, it is quite commonly abused recreationally. The typical recreational dose can be anything from 70&nbsp;mg to 500&nbsp;mg, or, in users with tolerance, even more.  [[Potentiators]] and [[adjuvants]] are often included when dihydrocodeine is used in an unsupervised fashion, especially [[carisoprodol]], [[hydroxyzine]] and [[first-generation antihistamine]]s, both to intensify the effect and lessen side-effects such as itching.<ref>Jack El-Hai : ''The Nazi and the Psychiatrist: [[Hermann Göring]], Dr. Douglas M. Kelley, and a Fatal Meeting of Minds at the End of WWII'', Publisher: PublicAffairs,  2013, {{ISBN|161039156X}}</ref>

==History==
Two famous users of dihydrocodeine were [[William S. Burroughs]], who described it as "twice as strong as codeine and almost as good as heroin" and [[Hermann Göring]], who consumed up to 100 tablets (3 grams) of dihydrocodeine per day and was captured by the Allies with a large quantity of the drug in a suitcase, reportedly more than twenty thousand tablets, quite probably the entire world supply at the time.<ref name="books.google.com">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T93nvBI0gfIC|title=Hermann Göring: Hitler's Second-in-command|last=Ramen|first=Fred|date=2000-01-01|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=9780823933075|language=en}}</ref>  He was also very fond of morphine and oxycodone (Eukodal), beginning with therapeutic use of morphine after being wounded in the groin during the November 1923 Beer Hall Putsch in Munich and then specifically starting dihydrocodeine therapy in the early 1930s for a toothache.<ref name="books.google.com"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gaijinass.com/2010/07/12/world-leaders-that-had-serious-drug-addictions/|title=World leaders that had serious drug addictions|date=2010-07-12|website=Gaijinass|access-date=2016-07-26}}</ref>
