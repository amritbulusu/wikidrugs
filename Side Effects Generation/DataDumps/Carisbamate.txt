'''Carisbamate''' (YKP 509, proposed trade name '''Comfyde''') is an experimental [[anticonvulsant]] drug under development by [[Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development]]. In 1998, the compound was in-licensed from SK Corp. (currently Life Science Business Division of [[SK Holdings]]), a South Korean company. A phase II clinical trial in the treatment of partial seizures demonstrated that the compound has efficacy in the treatment of partial seizures and a good safety profile. Since late 2006, the compound has been undergoing a large multicenter phase III clinical trial for the treatment of partial seizures.  Its [[mechanism of action]] is unknown.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rogawski MA |title=Diverse mechanisms of antiepileptic drugs in the development pipeline |journal=Epilepsy Res |volume=69 |issue=3 |pages=273–294 |year=2006 |pmid=16621450 |doi=10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2006.02.004 |pmc=1562526}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Novak GP, Kelley M, Zannikos P, Klein B |title=Carisbamate (RWJ-333369) |journal=Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=106–109 |year=2007 |pmid=17199023 |doi=10.1016/j.nurt.2006.11.016}}</ref>

On October 24, 2008, [[Johnson & Johnson]] announced that it had submitted a [[New Drug Application]] to the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for carisbamate.<ref>{{cite press release

A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of carisbamate in 323 patients with migraine failed to demonstrate that the active drug was more effective than placebo.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cady RK, Mathew N, Diener HC, Hu P, Haas M, Novak GP, ((Study Group)) |title=Evaluation of carisbamate for the treatment of migraine in a randomized, double-blind trial|journal=Headache|year= 2009 |volume=49|pages=216–226 |pmid= 19222595 |issue=2 |doi=10.1111/j.1526-4610.2008.01326.x}}</ref> However, carisbamate was well tolerated at doses up to 600&nbsp;mg/day.
