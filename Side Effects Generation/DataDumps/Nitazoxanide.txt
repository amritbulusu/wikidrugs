<!--Drugank's pharmacodynamics section:
Nitazoxanide is an antifolate containing the pyrrolopyrimidine-based nucleus that exerts its antineoplastic activity by disrupting folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication. In vitro studies have shown that nitazoxanide inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), all folate-dependent enzymes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Nitazoxanide is transported into cells by both the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, nitazoxanide is converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibitors of TS and GARFT. Polyglutamation is a time- and concentration-dependent process that occurs in tumor cells and, to a lesser extent, in normal tissues. Polyglutamated metabolites have an increased intracellular half-life resulting in prolonged drug action in malignant cells.

Following oral administration, nitazoxanide is rapidly [[hydrolyzed]] to the pharmacologically active metabolite, [[tizoxanide]], which is 99% protein bound.<ref name="FDA Nitazoxanide" /><ref name="pmid17888524">{{cite journal |author=Korba BE |title=Nitazoxanide, tizoxanide and other thiazolides are potent inhibitors of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus replication |journal=Antiviral Res. |volume=77 |issue=1 |pages=56–63 |date=January 2008 |pmid=17888524 |doi=10.1016/j.antiviral.2007.08.005 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166-3542(07)00397-X |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Montero AB |author3=Farrar K |display-authors=3 |last4=Gaye |first4=Karen |last5=Mukerjee |first5=Sampa |last6=Ayers |first6=Marc S. |last7=Rossignol |first7=Jean-François}}</ref> Tizoxanide is then [[glucuronide conjugation|glucuronide conjugated]] into the active metabolite, [[tizoxanide glucuronide]].<ref name="FDA Nitazoxanide" />  Peak plasma concentrations of the metabolites tizoxanide and tizoxanide glucuronide are observed 1–4&nbsp;hours after oral administration of nitazoxanide, whereas nitazoxanide itself is not detected in [[blood plasma]].<ref name="FDA Nitazoxanide" />

{{expand section|date=January 2016}}
Nitazoxanide is the prototype member of the [[thiazolide]]s, which is a [[drug class]] of structurally-related broad-spectrum [[antiparasitic]] compounds.<ref name="Thiazolides" /> Nitazoxanide is a light yellow crystalline powder. It is poorly soluble in ethanol and practically insoluble in water.

== History ==
Nitazoxanide was originally discovered in the 1980s by [[Jean-François Rossignol]] at the [[Pasteur Institute]]. Initial studies demonstrated activity versus [[tapeworms]]. ''In vitro'' studies demonstrated much broader activity. Dr. Rossignol co-founded Romark Laboratories, with the goal of bringing nitazoxanide to market as an anti-parasitic drug. Initial studies in the USA were conducted in collaboration with Unimed Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ([[Marietta, GA]]) and focused on development of the drug for treatment of [[cryptosporidiosis]] in [[AIDS]]. Controlled trials began shortly after the advent of effective anti-retroviral therapies. The trials were abandoned due to poor enrollment and the FDA rejected an application based on uncontrolled studies.

Subsequently, Romark launched a series of controlled trials. A placebo-controlled study of nitazoxanide in cryptosporidiosis demonstrated significant clinical improvement in adults and children with mild illness. Among malnourished children in Zambia with chronic cryptosporidiosis, a three-day course of therapy led to clinical and parasitologic improvement and improved survival. In Zambia and in a study conducted in Mexico, nitazoxanide was not successful in the treatment of cryptosporidiosis in advanced infection with human immunodeficiency virus at the doses used. However, it was effective in patients with higher CD4 counts. In treatment of giardiasis, nitazoxanide was superior to placebo and comparable to [[metronidazole]]. Nitazoxanide was successful in the treatment of metronidazole-resistant giardiasis. Studies have suggested efficacy in the treatment of [[cyclosporiasis]], [[isosporiasis]], and [[amebiasis]].<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Am. J. Trop. Med.
