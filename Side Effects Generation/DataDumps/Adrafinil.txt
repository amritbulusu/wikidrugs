Adrafinil is a [[prodrug]]; it is primarily [[metabolize]]d ''[[in vivo]]'' to [[modafinil]], resulting in very similar [[pharmacology|pharmacological]] effects.<ref name="Milgram2014" /> Unlike modafinil, however, it takes time for the [[metabolite]] to accumulate to active levels in the bloodstream.

Adrafinil was marketed in France under the trade name '''Olmifon'''<ref name="IndexNominum2000" /> until September 2011 when it was voluntarily discontinued.<ref name="ANSM2011" />

Because [[alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]]s were found to block effects of adrafinil and modafinil in animals, "most investigators assume[d] that adrafinil and modafinil both serve as α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor agonists."<ref name="Milgram2014" /> However, adrafinil and modafinil have not been found to bind to the α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor and they lack [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] [[sympathomimetic]] [[side effect]]s associated with activation of this receptor;<ref name="pmid6310690">{{cite journal | vauthors = Simon P, Chermat R, Puech AJ | title = Pharmacological evidence of the stimulation of central alpha-adrenergic receptors | journal = Prog.

===Pharmacokinetics===
In addition to modafinil, adrafinil also produces [[modafinil acid]] (CRL-40467) and [[modafinil sulfone]] (CRL-41056) as metabolites, which form from metabolic modification of modafinil.

==History==
Adrafinil was discovered in 1974 by two chemists working for the French pharmaceutical company [[Laboratoires Lafon]] who were screening compounds in search of [[analgesic]]s.<ref name="Guglietta2014">{{cite book|author=Antonio Guglietta|title=Drug Treatment of Sleep Disorders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zTugBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA212|date=28 November 2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-11514-6|pages=212–}}</ref> Pharmacological studies of adrafinil instead revealed [[psychostimulant]]-like effects such as [[hyperactivity]] and [[wakefulness]] in animals.<ref name="Guglietta2014" /> The substance was first tested in humans, specifically for the treatment of narcolepsy, in 1977–1978.<ref name="Guglietta2014" /> Introduced by Lafon (now Cephalon), it reached the market in France in 1984,<ref name="ANSM2011" /> and for the treatment of narcolepsy in 1985.<ref name="Guglietta2014" /><ref name="LiJohnson2013">{{cite book|author1=Jie Jack Li|author2=Douglas S. Johnson|title=Modern Drug Synthesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NtdT5maa_pMC&pg=RA2-PA55|date=27 March 2013|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-70124-9|pages=2–}}</ref>

In 1976, two years after the discovery of adrafinil, modafinil, its [[active metabolite]], was discovered.<ref name="Guglietta2014" /> Modafinil appeared to be more potent than adrafinil in animal studies, and was selected for further clinical development, with both adrafinil and modafinil eventually reaching the market.<ref name="Guglietta2014" /> Modafinil was first approved in France in 1994, and then in the United States in 1998.<ref name="LiJohnson2013" /> Lafon was acquired by [[Cephalon]] in 2001.<ref>url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=1366624</ref> As of September 2011, Cephalon has discontinued '''Olmifon''', its adrafinil product, while modafinil continues to be marketed.<ref name="ANSM2011" />

==Society and culture==

===Regulation===

====Athletic doping====
Adrafinil and its [[active metabolite]] modafinil were added to the list of substances prohibited for athletic competition according to [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] in 2004.<ref>[http://www.wada-ama.org/rtecontent/document/2007_List_En.pdf ''World Anti-Doping Agency - 2007 Prohibited List''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410171528/http://www.wada-ama.org/rtecontent/document/2007_List_En.pdf |date=2009-04-10 }}</ref>

====New Zealand====
In 2005 a Medical Classification Committee in [[New Zealand]] recommended to MEDSAFE NZ that adrafinil be classified as a [[prescription medicine]] due to risks of it being used as a [[party drug]].  At that time adrafinil was not scheduled in New Zealand.<ref>[http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/profs/class/mccMinDec2005.htm MCC Minutes Out of Session Meeting]. Medsafe.govt.nz (2013-05-23). Retrieved on 2013-12-18.</ref>

==Research==
In a [[clinical trial]] with [[clomipramine]] and [[placebo]] as active comparators, adrafinil showed efficacy in the treatment of [[depression (mood)|depression]].<ref name="Milgram2014" /> In contrast to clomipramine however, adrafinil was well-tolerated, and showed greater improvement in [[psychomotor retardation]] in comparison.<ref name="Milgram2014" /> As such, "further investigations of the antidepressive effects of adrafinil are warranted."<ref name="Milgram2014" />
