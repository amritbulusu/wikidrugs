==Medical uses==
[[File:Succhs.jpg|thumb|A vial of suxamethonium chloride]]
Its medical uses are limited to short-term muscle relaxation in [[anesthesia]] and intensive care, usually for facilitation of [[endotracheal intubation]]. It is perennially popular in emergency medicine because it has the fastest onset and shortest duration of action of all muscle relaxants. The former is a major point of consideration in the context of [[trauma care]], where endotracheal intubation may need to be completed very quickly. The latter means that, should attempts at endotracheal intubation fail and the person cannot be [[ventilator|ventilated]], there is a prospect for neuromuscular recovery and the onset of spontaneous breathing before [[hypoxemia|low blood oxygen levels]] occurs. It is better than [[rocuronium]] in making it easy to intubate.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tran|first1=DT|last2=Newton|first2=EK|last3=Mount|first3=VA|last4=Lee|first4=JS|last5=Wells|first5=GA|last6=Perry|first6=JJ|title=Rocuronium versus succinylcholine for rapid sequence induction intubation.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=29 October 2015|volume=10|pages=CD002788|pmid=26512948|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002788.pub3}}</ref>

Suxamethonium is also commonly used as the sole [[muscle relaxant]] during [[electroconvulsive therapy]], favoured for its short duration of action.

Suxamethonium is quickly degraded by plasma [[butyrylcholinesterase]] and the duration of effect is usually in the range of a few minutes. When plasma levels of butyrylcholinesterase are greatly diminished or an atypical form is present (an otherwise harmless inherited disorder), paralysis may last much longer, as is the case in liver failure or in neonates.<ref name="Flower2011">{{cite book|author=Rod J. Flower|title=Rang and Dale's Pharmacology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Go5RQAACAAJ|date=25 March 2011|publisher=Elsevier Science Health Science Division|isbn=978-0-7020-3471-8|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910183148/https://books.google.com/books?id=6Go5RQAACAAJ|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=}}</ref>

It is recommended that the vials be stored at a temperature between 2°-8°C, for optimum action. This is all the more important in temperate and tropical countries where room temperatures can go as high as 30°C.

==Side effects==
[[Adverse drug reaction|Side effects]] include [[malignant hyperthermia]], muscle pains, acute [[rhabdomyolysis]] with [[hyperkalemia|high blood levels of potassium]],<ref name="Flower2011"/> transient [[ocular hypertension]], [[constipation]]<ref>DiPiro, Joseph, et al. Pharmacotherapy: A Pathophysiologic Approach. 6th ed. McGraw-Hill, 2005:685.</ref> and changes in cardiac rhythm, including [[bradycardia|slow heart rate]], and [[cardiac arrest]]. In people with neuromuscular disease or [[burn]]s, an injection of suxamethonium can lead to a large release of [[potassium]] from [[skeletal muscles]], potentially resulting in cardiac arrest. Conditions having susceptibility to suxamethonium-induced high blood potassium are burns, [[closed head injury]], [[acidosis]], [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]], cerebral [[stroke]], [[drowning]], severe intra-abdominal [[sepsis]], massive [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]], [[myopathy]], and [[tetanus]].

Suxamethonium does not produce [[unconsciousness]] or [[anesthesia]], and its effects may cause considerable psychological distress while simultaneously making it impossible for a patient to communicate. Therefore, administration of the drug to a conscious patient is contraindicated.

===Hyperkalemia===
The side effect of high blood potassium may occur because the acetylcholine [[Cell surface receptor|receptor]] is propped open, allowing continued flow of potassium ions into the [[extracellular fluid]]. A typical increase of potassium ion serum concentration on administration of suxamethonium is 0.5&nbsp;[[mmol]] per [[liter]]. The increase is transient in otherwise healthy patients. The normal range of potassium is 3.5 to 5 mEq per liter. High blood potassium does not generally result in adverse effects below a concentration of 6.5 to 7 [[mEq]] per liter. Therefore, the increase in serum potassium level is usually not catastrophic in otherwise healthy patients.

Severely high blood levels of potassium will cause changes in [[cardiac electrophysiology]], which, if severe, can result in [[asystole]].

=== Malignant hyperthermia ===
[[Malignant hyperthermia]] (MH) from suxamethonium administration can result in a drastic and uncontrolled increase in skeletal muscle [[oxidative metabolism]]. This overwhelms the body's capacity to supply [[oxygen]], remove [[carbon dioxide]], and regulate body temperature, eventually leading to [[circulatory collapse]] and death if not treated quickly.

Susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia is often inherited as an [[autosomal dominant]] disorder, for which there are at least six [[gene|genetic loci]] of interest, the most prominent being the [[ryanodine]] receptor gene (RYR1). MH susceptibility is [[phenotypically|phenotype]] and genetically related to [[central core disease]] (CCD), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized both by MH symptoms and by [[myopathy]]. MH is usually unmasked by [[anesthesia]], or when a family member develops the symptoms. There is no simple, straightforward test to diagnose the condition. When MH develops during a procedure, treatment with [[dantrolene]] sodium is usually initiated; dantrolene and the avoidance of suxamethonium administration in susceptible people have markedly reduced the mortality from this condition.

===Apnea===

{{See also|Pseudocholinesterase deficiency}}

The normal short duration of action of suxamethonium is due to the rapid metabolism of the drug by non-specific plasma cholinesterases. However plasma cholinesterase activity is reduced in some people due to either genetic variation or acquired conditions, which results in a prolonged duration of neuromuscular block. Genetically, ninety six percent of the population have a normal (Eu:Eu) genotype and block duration; however, some people have atypical genes (Ea, Es, Ef) which can be found in varying combinations with the Eu gene, or other atypical genes (see [[Pseudocholinesterase deficiency]]). Such genes will result in a longer duration of action of the drug, ranging from 20 minutes up to several hours. Acquired factors that affect plasma cholinesterase activity include [[pregnancy]], [[liver disease]], [[kidney failure]], [[heart failure]], [[thyrotoxicosis]], and cancer, as well as a number of other drugs.<ref>Pharmacology for Anaesthesia and Intensive Care. 2nd Edition. Peck, Hill & Williams</ref>

If unrecognized by a clinician it could lead to awareness if anesthesia is discontinued whilst still paralyzed or hypoxemia (and potentially fatal consequences) if artificial ventilation is not maintained. Normal treatment is to maintain sedation and ventilate the patient on an intensive care unit until muscle function has returned. Blood testing for cholinesterase function can be performed.

[[Mivacurium]], a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug, is also metabolized via the same route with a similar clinical effect in patients deficient in plasma cholinesterase activity.

Deliberate induction of conscious apnea using this drug led to its use as a form of [[aversion therapy]] in the 1960s and 1970s in some prison and institutional settings.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Reimring | first1 = MJ | last2 = Morgan | first2 = SW | last3 = Bramwell | first3 = PF | year = 1970 | title = Succinylcholine as a modifier of acting-out behavior | url = | journal = Clinical Medicine | volume = 77 | issue = 7| page = 28 }}</ref><ref>[[Nicholas von Hoffman|von Hoffman, Nicholas]] (1972) "A Bit of 'Clockwork Orange,' California-Style."

==Mechanism of action==
There are two phases to the blocking effect of suxamethonium.

===Phase 1 block===
Phase 1 blocking has the principal paralytic effect. Binding of suxamethonium to the [[nicotinic acetylcholine]] receptor results in opening of the receptor's [[Valence electron|monovalent]] [[cation]] channel; a disorganized [[depolarization]] of the [[motor end-plate]] occurs and [[calcium]] is released from the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]].

In normal skeletal muscle, [[acetylcholine]] dissociates from the receptor following depolarization and is rapidly hydrolyzed by the [[enzyme]] [[acetylcholinesterase]]. The muscle cell is then ready for the next signal.

Suxamethonium has a longer duration of effect than acetylcholine, and is not hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase. By maintaining the [[membrane potential]] above threshold, it does not allow the muscle cell to repolarize. When acetylcholine binds to an already depolarized receptor, it cannot cause further depolarization.

Calcium is removed from the muscle cell [[cytoplasm]] independent of repolarization (depolarization signaling and muscle contraction are independent processes). As the calcium is taken up by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the muscle relaxes. This explains muscle [[flaccidity]] rather than [[Tetany (medical sign)|tetany]] following [[fasciculation]]s.

The results are membrane depolarization and transient fasciculations, followed by paralysis.

===Phase 2 block===
This phase is not abnormal and is a part of its mechanism of action. It is caused by the blood concentration of suxamethonium exceeding the therapeutic window. Desensitization occurs at the nerve terminal, and the myocyte becomes less sensitive to acetylcholine; the membrane repolarizes and cannot be depolarized again.

==Chemistry==
Suxamethonium is an odorless, white [[crystal]]line substance. Aqueous solutions have a [[pH]] of about 4. The [[dihydrate]] melts at 160&nbsp;°C, whereas the [[anhydrous]] melts at 190&nbsp;°C. It is highly soluble in water (1&nbsp;gram in about 1 mL), soluble in [[ethanol|ethyl alcohol]] (1&nbsp;gram in about 350 mL), slightly soluble in [[chloroform]], and practically insoluble in [[diethyl ether|ether]].  Suxamethonium is a [[hygroscopic]] compound.<ref>Gennaro, Alfonso. Remington: ''The Science and Practice of Pharmacy'', 20th ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2000:1336.</ref> The compound consists of two [[acetylcholine]] molecules that are linked by their [[acetyl]] groups. It can also be viewed as a central [[moiety (chemistry)|moiety]] of [[succinic acid]] with two [[choline]] moieties, one on each end.

==History==
Suxamethonium was first discovered in 1906 by Reid Hunt and René de M. Taveau. When studying the drug, animals were given curare and thus they missed the neuromuscular blocking properties of suxamethonium. Instead in 1949 an Italian group led by [[Daniel Bovet]] was first to describe succinylcholine induced paralysis. The clinical introduction of suxamethonium was described in 1951 by several groups. Papers published by Stephen Thesleff and Otto von Dardel in Sweden are important but also to be mentioned is work by Bruck, Mayrhofer and Hassfurther in Austria, Scurr and Bourne in UK, and Foldes in America.<ref name="pmid7047939">{{cite journal|last=Dorkins|first=HR|title=Suxamethonium-the development of a modern drug from 1906 to the present day.|journal=Medical History|date=Apr 1982|volume=26|issue=2|pages=145–68|doi=10.1017/S0025727300041132|pmid=7047939|pmc=1139149}}</ref>

==Society and culture==
Suxamethonium has been described as a "perfect poison" for murder, and has been used by criminals in murders.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2012/05/the-history-of-sux-the-worlds-most-discrete-murder-weapon/ |title=The History Of Sux, The World's Most Discrete Murder Weapon |first=Rubidium |last=Jayfk |work=gizmodo.com.au |date=29 May 2012 |accessdate=17 December 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222123455/http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2012/05/the-history-of-sux-the-worlds-most-discrete-murder-weapon/ |archivedate=22 December 2015 |df= }}</ref>
