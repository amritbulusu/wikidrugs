Vancomycin is indicated for the treatment of serious, life-threatening infections by [[Gram-positive]] bacteria unresponsive to other antibiotics.

==Side effects==
Serum vancomycin levels may be monitored in an effort to reduce side effects, although the value of such monitoring has been questioned.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Cantú TG, Yamanaka-Yuen NA, Lietman PS |title=Serum vancomycin concentrations: reappraisal of their clinical value|journal=Clin Infect Dis|year=1994|volume=18|issue=4|pages=533&ndash;43|pmid=8038306|doi=10.1093/clinids/18.4.533}}</ref> Peak and trough levels are usually monitored, and for research purposes, the area under the concentration curve is also sometimes used. Toxicity is best monitored by looking at trough values.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Lodise TP, Patel N, Lomaestro BM, Rodvold KA, Drusano GL |title=Relationship between initial vancomycin concentration‐time profile and nephrotoxicity (toxic to the kidneys) among hospitalized patients|journal=Clin Infect Dis|year=2009|volume=49|issue=4|pages=507&ndash;514|doi=10.1086/600884|pmid=19586413}}</ref>

Common [[adverse drug reaction]]s (≥1% of patients) associated with IV vancomycin include: local pain, which may be severe, and [[thrombophlebitis]].

Damage to the kidneys and to the hearing were a side effect of the early impure versions of vancomycin, and these were prominent in the clinical trials conducted in the mid-1950s.<ref name="Levine2006" /><ref name="Moellering2006" /> Later trials using purer forms of vancomycin found [[nephrotoxicity]] is an infrequent adverse effect (0.1% to 1% of patients), but this is accentuated in the presence of [[aminoglycoside]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Farber BF, ((Moellering RC Jr)) | title=Retrospective study of the toxicity of preparations of vancomycin from 1974 to 1981 | journal=Antimicrob Agents Chemother | year=1983 | volume=23 | pages=138–41 | pmid=6219616 | issue=1 | pmc=184631 | doi=10.1128/AAC.23.1.138 }}</ref>

Rare adverse effects (<0.1% of patients) include: [[anaphylaxis]], [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]], [[erythema multiforme]], [[Vancomycin#Red man syndrome|red man syndrome]], [[superinfection]], [[thrombocytopenia]], [[neutropenia]], [[leukopenia]], [[tinnitus]], [[Vancomycin#Ototoxicity|dizziness and/or ototoxicity]], and [[Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms|DRESS syndrome]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Blumenthal|first=Kimberly G.|last2=Patil|first2=Sarita U.|last3=Long|first3=Aidan A.|date=2012-04-01|title=The importance of vancomycin in drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome|journal=Allergy and Asthma Proceedings|volume=33|issue=2|pages=165–171|doi=10.2500/aap.2012.33.3498|issn=1539-6304|pmid=22525393}}</ref>

Vancomycin can induce platelet-reactive antibodies in the patient, leading to severe [[thrombocytopenia]] and bleeding with florid [[Petechia|petechial hemorrhages]], [[ecchymoses]], and wet [[purpura]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Drygalski A, Curtis BR | title=Vancomycin-Induced Immune Thrombocytopenia | journal= N Engl J Med | year=2007 | volume=356 | pages=904–10 | doi=10.1056/NEJMoa065066 | pmid=17329697 | issue=9}}</ref>

Vancomycin has traditionally been considered a nephrotoxic and ototoxic drug, based on observations by early investigators of elevated serum levels in renally impaired patients who had experienced ototoxicity, and subsequently through case reports in the medical literature. However, as the use of vancomycin increased with the spread of MRSA beginning in the 1970s, the previously reported rates of toxicity were recognized as not being observed. This was attributed to the removal of the impurities present in the earlier formulation of the drug, although those impurities were not specifically tested for toxicity.<ref name="Levine2006"/>

===Nephrotoxicity===
Subsequent reviews of accumulated case reports of vancomycin-related nephrotoxicity found  many of the patients had also received other known nephrotoxins, in particular, [[aminoglycosides]]. Most of the rest had other confounding factors, or insufficient data regarding the possibility of such, that prohibited the clear association of vancomycin with the observed renal dysfunction.

In 1994, the use of vancomycin monotherapy was clearly documented in only three of 82 available cases in the literature.<ref name="Cantu1994" /> Prospective and retrospective studies attempting to evaluate the incidence of vancomycin-related nephrotoxicity have largely been methodologically flawed and have produced variable results. The most methodologically sound investigations indicate  the actual incidence of vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity is around 5% to 7%. To put this into context, similar rates of renal dysfunction have been reported for [[cefamandole]] and [[benzylpenicillin]], two reputedly non-nephrotoxic antibiotics.

In addition, evidence to relate nephrotoxicity to vancomycin serum levels is inconsistent. Some studies have indicated an increased rate of nephrotoxicity when trough levels exceed 10&nbsp;µg/ml, but others have not reproduced these results. Nephrotoxicity has also been observed with concentrations within the "therapeutic" range, as well. In essence, the reputation of vancomycin as a nephrotoxin is overstated, and it has not been demonstrated that maintaining vancomycin serum levels within certain ranges will prevent its nephrotoxic effects, when they do occur.

===Ototoxicity===<!-- This section is linked from [[Vancomycin]] (this page)-->
Attempts to establish rates of vancomycin-induced ototoxicity are even more difficult due to the scarcity of quality evidence. The current consensus is that clearly related cases of vancomycin ototoxicity are rare. The association between vancomycin serum levels and ototoxicity is also uncertain. While cases of ototoxicity have been reported in patients whose vancomycin serum level exceeded 80&nbsp;µg/ml, cases have been reported in patients with therapeutic levels, as well. Thus, whether [[therapeutic drug monitoring]] of vancomycin for the purpose of maintaining "therapeutic" levels will prevent ototoxicity also remains unproven.

===Interactions with other nephrotoxins===
Another area of controversy and uncertainty concerns the question of whether, and if so, to what extent, vancomycin increases the toxicity of other nephrotoxins. Clinical studies have yielded variable results, but animal models indicate some increased nephrotoxic effect probably occurs when vancomycin is added to nephrotoxins such as aminoglycosides. However, a dose- or serum level-effect relationship has not been established.

==Dosing considerations==

===Intravenous vs oral administration===
Vancomycin must be given [[intravenous]]ly (IV) for systemic therapy, since it is not absorbed from the intestine. It is a large hydrophilic molecule that partitions poorly across the gastrointestinal [[mucosa]]. Due to short half-life, it is often injected twice daily.<ref name=VB2006>{{cite journal |author=Van Bambeke F |title=Glycopeptides and glycodepsipeptides in clinical development: a comparative review of their antibacterial spectrum, pharmacokinetics and clinical efficacy |journal=Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs |volume=7 |issue=8 |pages=740–9 | date=August 2006 |pmid=16955686}}</ref>

The only approved indication for oral vancomycin therapy is in the treatment of pseudomembranous colitis, where it must be given orally to reach the site of infection in the colon. Following oral administration, the fecal concentration of vancomycin is around 500&nbsp;µg/ml<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Edlund C, Barkholt L, Olsson-Liljequist B, Nord CE |title=Effect of vancomycin on intestinal flora of patients who previously received antimicrobial therapy |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=729–32 | date=September 1997 |pmid=9314469 |doi=10.1086/513755}}</ref> (sensitive strains of ''C. difficile'' have a mean inhibitory concentration of ≤2&nbsp;µg/ml<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Peláez T, Alcalá L, Alonso R, etal |title=Reassessment of ''Clostridium difficile'' susceptibility to metronidazole and vancomycin|journal=Antimicrob Agents Chemother|year=2002|volume=46|issue=6|pages=1647&ndash;1650|doi=10.1128/AAC.46.6.1647-1650.2002}}</ref>)

Inhaled vancomycin has also been used ([[off-label]]), via [[nebulizer]], for treatment of various infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract.

The caustic nature of vancomycin makes IV therapy using peripheral lines a risk for thrombophlebitis. Ideally, central lines<!--explain, PICCs, --> or infusion ports should be used.<ref>[http://www.nursingcenter.com/prodev/ce_article.asp?tid=745323 Choosing the Right Intravenous Catheter<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110320035150/http://www.nursingcenter.com/prodev/ce_article.asp?tid=745323 |date=2011-03-20 }}</ref>

Vancomycin is recommended to be administered in a dilute solution slowly, over at least 60 min (maximum rate of 10&nbsp;mg/min for doses >500&nbsp;mg)<ref name="AMH2006" /> due to the high incidence of pain and thrombophlebitis and to avoid an infusion reaction known as the "red man syndrome" or "red neck syndrome". This syndrome, usually appearing within 4 to 10&nbsp;min after the commencement or soon after the completion of an infusion, is characterized by flushing and/or an [[erythematous]] rash that affects the face, neck, and upper torso. These findings are due to interaction of vancomycin with MRGPRX2, a GPCR mediating IgE-independent mast cell degranulation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Azimi|first1=E|last2=Reddy|first2=VB|last3=Lerner|first3=EA|title=Brief communication: MRGPRX2, atopic dermatitis and red man syndrome.|journal=Itch (Philadelphia, Pa.)|date=March 2017|volume=2|issue=1|doi=10.1097/itx.0000000000000005|pmid=28367504}}</ref> Less frequently, [[hypotension]] and [[angioedema]] may also occur.

===Therapeutic drug monitoring===
Plasma level monitoring of vancomycin is necessary due to the drug's biexponential distribution, intermediate hydrophilicity, and potential for ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, especially in populations with poor renal function and/or increased propensity to bacterial infection. Vancomycin activity is considered to be time-dependent; that is, antimicrobial activity depends on the duration that the serum drug concentration exceeds the [[minimum inhibitory concentration]] <!-- (MIC) --> of the target organism. Thus, peak serum levels have not been shown to correlate with efficacy or toxicity; indeed, concentration monitoring is unnecessary in most cases. Circumstances in which [[therapeutic drug monitoring]] <!-- (TDM) --> is warranted include: patients receiving concomitant aminoglycoside therapy, patients with (potentially) altered [[pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]] parameters, patients on [[hemodialysis|haemodialysis]], patients administered high-dose or prolonged treatment, and patients with impaired renal function. In such cases, trough concentrations are measured.<ref name="AMH2006" /><ref name="Cantu1994">{{cite journal | last1 = Cantú | first1 = TG | last2 = Yamanaka-Yuen | first2 = NA | last3 = Lietman | first3 = PS | title = Serum vancomycin concentrations: reappraisal of their clinical value | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 533–43 | year = 1994 | pmid = 8038306 | doi = 10.1093/clinids/18.4.533 }}</ref><ref name="Moellering1994">{{cite journal | last1 = Moellering Jr | first1 = RC | title = Monitoring serum vancomycin levels: climbing the mountain because it is there? | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 544–6 | year = 1994 | pmid = 8038307 | doi=10.1093/clinids/18.4.544}}</ref><ref name="Karam1999">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1592/phco.19.4.257.30933 | last1 = Karam | first1 = CM | last2 = McKinnon | first2 = PS | last3 = Neuhauser | first3 = MM | last4 = Rybak | first4 = MJ | title = Outcome assessment of minimizing vancomycin monitoring and dosing adjustments | journal = Pharmacotherapy | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 257–66 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10221365 }}</ref>

A set of multienzymes (peptide synthase CepA, CepB, and CepC) are responsible for assembling the heptapeptide. (Figure 2). The organization of CepA, CepB, and Cep C closely resembles other peptide synthases such as those for [[surfactin]] (SrfA1, SrfA2, and SrfA3) and [[gramicidin]] (GrsA and GrsB).<ref name="pmid9545426"/> Each peptide synthase activates codes for various amino acids to activate each domain. CepA codes for modules 1, 2, and 3. CepB codes for modules 4, 5, and 6, and CepC codes for module 7.

==Pharmacology and chemistry==
Vancomycin is a branched [[Wiktionary:tricyclic|tricyclic]] [[Glycosylation|glycosylated]] [[nonribosomal peptide]] produced by the [[Actinobacteria]] species ''Amycolatopsis orientalis'' (formerly designated ''Nocardia orientalis'').

Vancomycin exhibits [[atropisomer]]ism — it has multiple chemically distinct [[rotamer]]s owing to the rotational restriction of some of the bonds. The form present in the drug is the thermodynamically more stable [[Conformational isomerism|conformer]], so has more potent activity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

=== Mechanism of action ===

Vancomycin acts by inhibiting proper cell wall synthesis in Gram-positive bacteria. Due to the different mechanism by which Gram-negative bacteria produce their cell walls and the various factors related to entering the outer membrane of [[Gram-negative]] organisms, vancomycin is not active against them (except some nongonococcal species of ''[[Neisseria]]'').

The large [[hydrophilic]] molecule is able to form [[hydrogen bond]] interactions with the terminal D-alanyl-D-alanine moieties of the NAM/NAG-peptides. Under normal circumstances, this is a five-point interaction. This binding of vancomycin to the D-Ala-D-Ala prevents cell wall synthesis of the long polymers of N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) that form the backbone strands of the bacterial cell wall, and it prevents the backbone polymers that do manage to form from cross-linking with each other.<ref>[http://www.clinicalpharmacology-ip.com/Forms/Monograph/monograph.aspx?cpnum=638&sec=monmech Clinical Pharmacology<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

{{wide image|Vancomycin resistance.svg|800px|
Mechanism of vancomycin action and resistance: This diagram shows only one of two ways vancomycin acts against bacteria (inhibition of cell wall cross-linking) and only one of many ways that bacteria can become resistant to it.
# Vancomycin is added to the bacterial environment while it is trying to synthesize new cell wall. Here, the cell wall strands have been synthesized, but not yet cross-linked.
# Vancomycin recognizes and binds to the two D-ala residues on the end of the peptide chains. However, in resistant bacteria, the last D-ala residue has been replaced by a D-lactate, so vancomycin cannot bind.
# In resistant bacteria, cross-links are successfully formed. However, in the nonresistant bacteria, the vancomycin bound to the peptide chains prevents them from interacting properly with the cell wall cross-linking enzyme.
# In the resistant bacteria, stable cross-links are formed. In the sensitive bacteria, cross-links cannot be formed and the cell wall falls apart.

===Acquired resistance===
Evolution of microbial [[antibiotic resistance|resistance]] to vancomycin is a growing problem, in particular, within healthcare facilities such as hospitals. While newer alternatives to vancomycin exist, such as [[linezolid]] (2000) and [[daptomycin]] (2003), the widespread use of vancomycin makes resistance to the drug a significant worry, especially for individual patients if resistant infections are not quickly identified and the patient continues the ineffective treatment. [[Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus|Vancomycin-resistant ''Enterococcus'']] <!-- (VRE) --> emerged in 1987. Vancomycin resistance evolved in more common pathogenic organisms during the 1990s and 2000s, including [[vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|vancomycin-intermediate ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (VISA) and [[vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|vancomycin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (VRSA).<ref name="Smith1999">{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = TL | last2 = Pearson | first2 = ML | last3 = Wilcox | first3 = KR | last4 = Cruz | first4 = C | last5 = Lancaster | first5 = MV | last6 = Robinson-Dunn | first6 = B | last7 = Tenover | first7 = FC | last8 = Zervos | first8 = MJ | last9 = Band | first9 = JD | title = Emergence of vancomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus.

One mechanism of resistance to vancomycin involves the alteration to the terminal amino acid residues of the NAM/NAG-peptide subunits, under normal conditions, <small>D</small>-alanyl-<small>D</small>-alanine, to which vancomycin binds. The <small>D</small>-alanyl-<small>D</small>-lactate variation results in the loss of one hydrogen-bonding interaction (4, as opposed to 5 for <small>D</small>-alanyl-<small>D</small>-alanine) possible between vancomycin and the peptide. This loss of just one point of interaction results in a 1000-fold decrease in affinity. The <small>D</small>-alanyl-<small>D</small>-serine variation causes a six-fold loss of affinity between vancomycin and the peptide, likely due to steric hindrance.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Pootoolal J, Neu J, Wright GD |title=Glycopeptide antibiotic resistance |journal=Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol | year=2002 | pages=381–408 | volume=42 | pmid=11807177 |doi=10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.42.091601.142813 }}</ref>

In enterococci, this modification appears to be due to the expression of an enzyme that alters the terminal residue. Three main resistance variants have been characterised to date among resistant ''Enterococcus faecium'' and ''E. faecalis'' populations:
*VanA - enterococcal resistance to vancomycin and [[teicoplanin]]; inducible on exposure to these agents
*VanB - lower-level  enterococcal resistance; inducible by vancomycin, but strains may remain susceptible to teicoplanin
*VanC - least clinically important; enterococci resistant only to vancomycin; constitutive resistance

Variant of vancomycin has been tested that binds to the resistant D-lactic acid variation in vancomycin-resistant bacterial cell walls, and also binds well to the original target (vancomycin-susceptible bacteria).<ref>{{cite journal | title=A Redesigned Vancomycin Engineered for Dual d-Ala-d-Ala and d-Ala-d-Lac Binding Exhibits Potent Antimicrobial Activity Against Vancomycin-Resistant Bacteria | last = Xie | first = J | journal = [[J.

== History ==
Vancomycin was first isolated in 1953 by [[Edmund Kornfeld]] (working at [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]]) from a soil sample collected from the interior jungles of [[Borneo]] by a missionary.<ref name="Shnayerson">Shnayerson, Michael; Plotkin, Mark (2003). ''The Killers Within: The Deadly Rise of Drug-Resistant Bacteria''. Back Bay Books. {{ISBN|978-0-316-73566-7}}.</ref> The organism that produced it was eventually named ''[[Amycolatopsis orientalis]]''.<ref name="Levine2006">{{cite journal | author=Levine, D. | title=Vancomycin: A History | journal=Clin Infect Dis | year=2006 | volume=42| pages=S5–S12 | pmid=16323120 | doi=10.1086/491709 }}</ref> The original indication for vancomycin was for the treatment of penicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus''.<ref name="Levine2006"/><ref name="Moellering2006">{{cite journal | author=Moellering, RC Jr. | title=Vancomycin: a 50-year reassessment | journal=Clin Infect Dis |date=January 2006 | volume=42 Suppl 1 | pages = S3–4 | pmid=16323117 | doi=10.1086/491708 }}</ref>

The compound was initially called compound 05865, but was eventually given the generic name vancomycin, derived from the term "vanquish".<ref name="Levine2006"/> One advantage that was quickly apparent was that staphylococci did not develop significant resistance, despite serial passage in culture media containing vancomycin. The rapid development of penicillin resistance by staphylococci led to its being fast-tracked for approval by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] <!-- (FDA) --> in 1958. Eli Lilly first marketed vancomycin hydrochloride under the trade name Vancocin<ref name="Moellering2006"/>

Vancomycin never became the first-line treatment for ''S. aureus'' for several reasons:
#It possesses poor oral bioavailability, so must be given intravenously for most infections.
#β-Lactamase-resistant semisynthetic penicillins such as [[methicillin]] (and its successors, [[nafcillin]] and [[cloxacillin]]) were subsequently developed, which have better activity against non-MRSA staphylococci.
#Early trials used early, impure forms of the drug ("Mississippi mud"), which were found to be toxic to the [[inner ear]] and to the kidneys;<ref name="Griffiths1981">{{cite journal | author=Griffith RS. | title=Introduction to vancomycin | journal=Rev Infect Dis | year=1981 | volume=3 | pages=S200–S204 | pmid=7043707 }}</ref> these findings led to vancomycin's being relegated to the position of a drug of last resort.<ref name="Moellering2006"/>

In 2004, Eli Lilly licensed Vancocin to [[ViroPharma]] in the U.S., Flynn Pharma in the UK, and [[Aspen Pharmacare]] in Australia. The [[patent]] had expired in the early 1980s, and the FDA authorized the sale of several generic versions in the USA, including from manufacturers Bioniche Pharma, [[Baxter Healthcare]], [[Sandoz]], [[Akorn]]-[[Strides Shasun|Strides]], and [[Hospira]].<ref>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/docs/tempai.cfm Orange Book: Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817081251/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/docs/tempai.cfm |date=2016-08-17 }}</ref>

==Cost==
Vancomycin is available as a generic medication.<ref name=Ric2015/> The wholesale cost of an intravenous dose is about US$1.70 to 6.00.<ref name=ERC2015/> In the United States, the pills are very expensive.<ref name=AHFS2015/> The intravenous solution may be taken by mouth for'' C. difficile'' to reduce costs.<ref name=Man2014/>
