'''Apraclonidine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]), also known under the brand name '''Iopidine''', is a [[Sympathomimetic drug|sympathomimetic]] used in [[glaucoma]] therapy. It is an [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptor]] [[agonist]] and a weak [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub> adrenergic receptor]] agonist.

Topical apraclonidine is administered at a concentration of 1% for the prevention and treatment of post-surgical [[intraocular pressure]] (IOP) elevation and 0.5% for short-term adjunctive therapy in patients on maximally tolerated medical therapy who require additional reduction of IOP. One drop is usually added one hour prior to laser [[eye surgery]] and another drop is given after the procedure is complete.

==Clinical uses==
Apraclonidine is indicated for the short-term adjunctive treatment of glaucoma for patients on maximally tolerated medical therapy who require additional reduction of IOP. These patients, who are treated with apraclonidine to delay surgery, should have frequent follow-up examinations and treatment should be discontinued if the intraocular pressure rises significantly.

Apraclonidine may be useful in the diagnosis of [[Horner's syndrome]]. In Horner's syndrome, the sympathetic innervation to the pupillary dilator muscle is lost. The affected pupil is thus miotic and the pupillary dilator responds to denervation by increasing α<sub>1</sub> receptors. Apraclonidine is useful in this case due to its weak α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic properties. When applied to the denervated (and thus hyper-sensitive) pupillary dilator muscle, a super-normal dilatory response is generated in which the pupil dilates to a degree greater than that which would be seen in a non-denervated muscle. This causes the reversal of [[anisocoria]] that is characteristic of Horner's.

Topical apraclonidine can also decrease IOP in glaucoma patients by increasing trabecular outflow, in a similar way to [[clonidine]],<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0161-6420(95)31000-7| title = Effects of Apraclonidine on Aqueous Humor Dynamics in Human Eyes| journal = Ophthalmology| volume = 102| issue = 3| pages = 456| year = 1995| last1 = Toris | first1 = C.
