'''Rapastinel''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) (former developmental code names '''GLYX-13''', '''BV-102''') is a novel [[antidepressant]] that is under development by [[Allergan]] (previously [[Naurex]]) as an [[adjunctive therapy]] for the treatment of [[treatment-resistant depression|treatment-resistant]] [[major depressive disorder]].<ref name="pmid23455590">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hashimoto K, Malchow B, Falkai P, Schmitt A | title = Glutamate modulators as potential therapeutic drugs in schizophrenia and affective disorders | journal = Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci | volume = 263 | issue = 5 | pages = 367–77 |date=August 2013  | pmid = 23455590 | doi = 10.1007/s00406-013-0399-y | url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid26997507">{{cite journal | vauthors = Moskal JR, Burgdorf JS, Stanton PK, Kroes RA, Disterhoft JF, Burch RM, Amin Khan M | title = The Development of Rapastinel (Formerly GLYX-13); a rapid acting and long lasting antidepressant | journal = Curr Neuropharmacol | volume = | issue = | pages = | year = 2016 | pmid = 26997507 | doi = | url = }}</ref> It is a [[central nervous system|centrally active]], [[intravenous]]ly [[drug administration|administered]] (non-[[oral administration|orally active]]) [[amide|amidated]] [[tetrapeptide]] (Thr-Pro-Pro-Thr-NH<sub>2</sub>) that acts as a [[binding selectivity|selective]], weak [[partial agonist]] (mixed [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]]/[[agonist]]) of an [[allosteric site]] of the [[glycine]] site of the [[NMDA receptor]] complex ([[intrinsic activity|E<sub>max</sub>]] ≈ 25%).<ref name="pmid23455590" /><ref name="pmid26997507" /> The drug is a rapid-acting and long-lasting antidepressant as well as robust [[cognitive enhancer]] by virtue of its ability to both inhibit and enhance NMDA receptor-mediated [[signal transduction]].<ref name="pmid23455590" /><ref name="pmid26997507" />

On March 3, 2014, the U.S. FDA granted [[FDA Fast Track Development Program|Fast Track designation]] to the development of rapastinel as an adjunctive therapy in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder.<ref>FDA Grants Fast Track Designation to Naurex's Rapid-Acting Novel Antidepressant GLYX-13 http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fda-grants-fast-track-designation-to-naurexs-rapid-acting-novel-antidepressant-glyx-13-248174561.html</ref> As of 2015, the drug had completed [[Phases of clinical research#Phase II|phase II]] clinical development for this indication.<ref name="Naurex2014">http://naurex.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Naurex_P2b_Data_Press_Release_FINAL_Approved.pdf</ref> On January 29, 2016, Allergan (who acquired Naurex in July 2015) announced that rapastinel had received [[Breakthrough Therapy]] designation from the U.S. FDA for adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder.

Rapastinel belongs to a group of compounds, referred to as ''[[glyxin]]s'' (hence the original developmental code name of rapastinel, GLYX-13),<ref name="BurgdorfZhang2011">{{cite journal|last1=Burgdorf|first1=Jeffrey|last2=Zhang|first2=Xiao-lei|last3=Weiss|first3=Craig|last4=Matthews|first4=Elizabeth|last5=Disterhoft|first5=John F.|last6=Stanton|first6=Patric K.|last7=Moskal|first7=Joseph R.|title=The N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor modulator GLYX-13 enhances learning and memory, in young adult and learning impaired aging rats|journal=Neurobiology of Aging|volume=32|issue=4|year=2011|pages=698–706|issn=0197-4580|doi=10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2009.04.012|pmid=19446371|pmc=3035742}}</ref> that were derived via [[structural modification]] of [[B6B21]], a [[monoclonal antibody]] that similarly binds to and modulates the NMDA receptor.<ref name="pmid26997507" /><ref name="pmid1828831">{{cite journal | vauthors = Haring R, Stanton PK, Scheideler MA, Moskal JR | title = Glycine-like modulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors by a monoclonal antibody that enhances long-term potentiation | journal = J.

[[Apimostinel]] (NRX-1074), an [[structural analog|analogue]] of rapastinel with the same [[mechanism of action]] but dramatically improved [[potency (pharmacology)|potency]], is being developed by the same company as a follow-on compound to rapastinel.
