'''Diethylstilbestrol''' ('''DES'''), also known formerly (and inappropriately) as '''stilboestrol''', is a [[Organic compound#Synthetic compounds|synthetic]], [[nonsteroidal]] [[estrogen]] of the [[stilbestrol]] group that was first synthesized in 1938.<ref name="Elks2014">{{cite book | vauthors = Elks J | title = The Dictionary of Drugs: Chemical Data: Chemical Data, Structures and Bibliographies | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0vXTBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA396 | date = 14 November 2014 | publisher = Springer | isbn = 978-1-4757-2085-3 | pages = 396– }}</ref> It is also classified as an [[endocrine disruptor]]. Human exposure to DES occurred through diverse sources, such as dietary ingestion from supplemented cattle feed and medical treatment for certain conditions, including breast and prostate cancers. From about 1940 to 1971, DES was given to pregnant women in the mistaken belief it would reduce the risk of pregnancy complications and losses.

In 1971, DES was shown to cause [[Clear-cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina|clear cell carcinoma]], a rare vaginal tumor, in girls and women who had been exposed to this drug ''[[in utero]]''. The United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] subsequently withdrew approval of DES as a treatment for pregnant women. Follow-up studies have indicated that DES also has the potential to cause a variety of significant adverse medical complications during the lifetimes of those exposed.<ref name="urlDES Update: For Consumers.

==Medical uses==
{{unreferenced|section|date=September 2017}}
DES has been used in the past for the following indications:

* [[Recurrent miscarriage]] in [[pregnancy]]
* [[Hormone replacement therapy]] for [[menopausal]] [[symptom]]s such as [[hot flash]]es and [[atrophic vaginitis|vaginal atrophy]]
* Hormone replacement therapy for [[hypoestrogenism]] (e.g., [[gonadal dysgenesis]], [[premature ovarian failure]], and after [[oophorectomy]])
* [[Postpartum]] [[lactation suppression]] to prevent or reverse [[breast engorgement]]
* [[Gonorrhea]]l [[vaginitis]] (discontinued following the introduction of the [[antibiotic]] [[penicillin]])
* [[Prostate cancer]] and [[breast cancer]]
* Prevention of [[tall stature]] in tall adolescent girls
* As an [[emergency contraceptive|emergency postcoital contraceptive]]
* As a means of [[chemical castration]] for [[hypersexuality]] and [[paraphilia]]s in men and [[sex offender]]s.

===Second generation===

====DES daughters====
DES gained notoriety when it was shown to cause a rare vaginal tumor in girls and young women who had been exposed to this drug ''in utero''. In 1971, the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' published a report showing that seven of eight girls and young women (ages 14 to 22) who had been diagnosed with [[Clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina|vaginal clear cell adenocarcinoma]] had been exposed prenatally to DES.<ref name=herbst>{{cite journal | vauthors = Herbst AL, Ulfelder H, Poskanzer DC | title = Adenocarcinoma of the vagina. Association of maternal stilbestrol therapy with tumor appearance in young women | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 284 | issue = 15 | pages = 878–81 | date = April 1971 | pmid = 5549830 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM197104222841604 }}</ref> Subsequent studies have shown an approximate 40-fold increased risk of vaginal/cervical clear cell adenocarcinoma in women exposed ''in utero'' to DES. As a consequence of this evidence, DES is considered an established human carcinogen. DES was one of the first transplacental carcinogens discovered in humans, meaning a toxin could cross the placenta and harm the fetus. It had originally been believed that the placenta protected the developing fetus but it is now known that is not true. Daughters exposed to DES ''in utero'' may also have an increased risk of moderate to severe cervical squamous cell dysplasia and an increased risk of breast cancer.<ref name="pmid17390375">{{cite journal | vauthors = Troisi R, Hatch EE, Titus-Ernstoff L, Hyer M, Palmer JR, Robboy SJ, Strohsnitter WC, Kaufman R, Herbst AL, Hoover RN | title = Cancer risk in women prenatally exposed to diethylstilbestrol | journal = International Journal of Cancer | volume = 121 | issue = 2 | pages = 356–60 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17390375 | doi = 10.1002/ijc.22631 }}</ref>

In addition to its carcinogenic properties, DES is a known [[teratogen]], an agent capable of causing malformations in daughters and sons who were exposed ''in utero''. DES-exposed daughters are at an increased risk of abnormalities of the reproductive tract, including vaginal epithelial changes such as [[vaginal adenosis]] (which means a type of cell normally found in the uterus, columnar cells, are also present in the vagina), an increased cervical transformation zone, and uterine abnormalities, such as [[T-shaped uterus]]. These anomalies contribute to an increased risk of infertility and adverse pregnancy outcomes in prenatally DES-exposed daughters. The most recent published research on DES daughters' adverse health outcomes documented by the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) appears in the October 6, 2011 issue of the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' under the authorship of RN Hoover ''et al.'', and lists these adverse effects and risk factors: Cumulative risks in women exposed to DES, as compared with those not exposed, were as follows: for infertility, 33.3% vs. 15.5%; spontaneous abortion, 50.3% vs. 38.6%; preterm delivery, 53.3% vs. 17.8%; loss of second-trimester pregnancy, 16.4% vs. 1.7%; ectopic pregnancy, 14.6% vs. 2.9%; preeclampsia, 26.4% vs. 13.7%; stillbirth, 8.9% vs. 2.6%; early menopause, 5.1% vs. 1.7%; grade 2 or higher cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, 6.9% vs. 3.4%; and breast cancer at 40 years of age or older, 3.9% vs. 2.2%.<ref name="pmid21991952">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoover RN, Hyer M, Pfeiffer RM, Adam E, Bond B, Cheville AL, Colton T, Hartge P, Hatch EE, Herbst AL, Karlan BY, Kaufman R, Noller KL, Palmer JR, Robboy SJ, Saal RC, Strohsnitter W, Titus-Ernstoff L, Troisi R | title = Adverse health outcomes in women exposed in utero to diethylstilbestrol | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 365 | issue = 14 | pages = 1304–14 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21991952 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1013961 }}</ref> Daughters with prenatal exposure to DES may also have an increased risk of uterine fibroids, and [[Cervical incompetence|incompetent cervix]] in adulthood.<ref name="urlorwh.od.nih.gov">{{cite web | url = http://orwh.od.nih.gov/health/fibroidsrevisedmarch2006.pdf | title = Status of Research on Uterine Fibroids (leiomyomata uteri) at the National Institutes of Health | author = Office of Research on Women’s Health, NIH, DHHS| date = March 2006 | publisher = United States National Institutes of Health }}</ref>

In an [[animal model]] designed to study  environmental estrogens, DES turned out to be an [[obesogen]] capable of causing adult weight gain in female mice which had been exposed to DES during neonatal development.

====DES sons====
Initially, fewer studies documented risks of prenatal exposure to DES on males (referred to as "DES sons"). In the 1970s and early 1980s, studies published on prenatally DES-exposed males investigated increased risk of testicular cancer, infertility and urogenital abnormalities in development, such as [[cryptorchidism]] and [[hypospadias]].<ref name="pmid972792">{{cite journal | vauthors = Henderson BE, Benton B, Cosgrove M, Baptista J, Aldrich J, Townsend D, Hart W, Mack TM | title = Urogenital tract abnormalities in sons of women treated with diethylstilbestrol | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 58 | issue = 4 | pages = 505–7 | date = October 1976 | pmid = 972792 }}</ref><ref name="pmid37351">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gill WB, Schumacher GF, Bibbo M, Straus FH, Schoenberg HW | title = Association of diethylstilbestrol exposure in utero with cryptorchidism, testicular hypoplasia and semen abnormalities | journal = The Journal of Urology | volume = 122 | issue = 1 | pages = 36–9 | date = July 1979 | pmid = 37351 }}</ref> Research published in the U.S. by Palmer ''et al.'' in 2009 further confirmed evidence of these findings.<ref name="pmid19689815">{{cite journal | vauthors = Palmer JR, Herbst AL, Noller KL, Boggs DA, Troisi R, Titus-Ernstoff L, Hatch EE, Wise LA, Strohsnitter WC, Hoover RN | title = Urogenital abnormalities in men exposed to diethylstilbestrol in utero: a cohort study | journal = Environmental Health | volume = 8 | pages = 37 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19689815 | pmc = 2739506 | doi = 10.1186/1476-069X-8-37 }}</ref> Additional research published in Finland in 2012 has further confirmed an increased risk of [[cryptorchidism]] among males exposed prenatally to DES.<ref name="pmid22127307">{{cite journal | vauthors = Virtanen HE, Adamsson A | title = Cryptorchidism and endocrine disrupting chemicals | journal = Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology | volume = 355 | issue = 2 | pages = 208–20 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22127307 | doi = 10.1016/j.mce.2011.11.015 }}</ref>

Various neurological changes occur after prenatal exposure of embryonic males to DES and other estrogenic endocrine disrupters. Animals that exhibited these structural neurological changes were also shown to demonstrate various gender-related behavioral changes (so-called "feminization of males").

====DES Daughters and Sons====
A study of around 5,600 women and 2,600 men who had documented prenatal exposure to DES, called "DES Daughters" and "DES Sons", respectively, found that "DES Daughters were just as likely as unexposed women to be left-handed. DES Sons were slightly more likely to be left-handed than unexposed men (14% vs. 11%, respectively). The researchers found no association between DES exposure and reported mental illness in DES Daughters, although the authors cautioned that this aspect may be under-represented due to the nature of self-reported data. In addition, no association was found between DES exposure and anorexia or bulimia."<ref>{{cite web|title=Recent DES Research: Psychosexual Characteristics of Men and Women Exposed Prenatally to Diethylstilbestrol|url=https://www.cdc.gov/des/consumers/research/recent_psychosexual.html|publisher=CDC|accessdate=16 May 2017}}</ref>

===Psychological anomalies===
Most of the initial research documenting the psychological effects of prenatal DES exposure was poorly conducted, often by mail card. Despite that, some more carefully conducted studies show a clear link to depression,<ref name="pmid8310108">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pillard RC, Rosen LR, Meyer-Bahlburg H, Weinrich JD, Feldman JF, Gruen R, Ehrhardt AA | title = Psychopathology and social functioning in men prenatally exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 55 | issue = 6 | pages = 485–91 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8310108 | doi = 10.1097/00006842-199311000-00003 }}</ref><ref name="Diethylstilbestrol exposure in utero and depression in women">{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Reilly EJ, Mirzaei F, Forman MR, Ascherio A | title = Diethylstilbestrol exposure in utero and depression in women | journal = American Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 171 | issue = 8 | pages = 876–82 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20332145 | pmc = 2877444 | doi = 10.1093/aje/kwq023 }}</ref> and a more recent French study asserts that there was an 83% increase in psychological disorders for offspring that were prenatally exposed to DES.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Soyer-Gobillard MO, Paris F, Gaspari L, Courtet P, Sultan C | title = Association between fetal DES-exposure and psychiatric disorders in adolescence/adulthood: evidence from a French cohort of 1002 prenatally exposed children | journal = Gynecological Endocrinology | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–9 | date = 2016 | pmid = 26172930 | doi = 10.3109/09513590.2015.1063604 }}</ref>

===Third generation===
Current research also looks at DES in the third generation. These are the grandchildren of women who were given DES during pregnancy and whose mother or father was therefore exposed to DES ''in utero''. Studies of the third generation are important because DES might be associated with [[epigenetics|epigenetic]] changes, which involve changes to the way genes behave (not involving the DNA itself) that may be heritable from one generation to another. If epigenetic changes occur and are heritable, studies of the DES-exposed third generation have implications for the influence of environmental endocrine disruptors on human health and evolution.

Recent studies from the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) show that the daughters of women who were exposed ''in utero'' to DES may be less likely than the unexposed to have regular menstrual periods.<ref name=DES_Granddaughters>{{cite journal | vauthors = Titus-Ernstoff L, Troisi R, Hatch EE, Wise LA, Palmer J, Hyer M, Kaufman R, Adam E, Strohsnitter W, Noller K, Herbst AL, Gibson-Chambers J, Hartge P, Hoover RN | title = Menstrual and reproductive characteristics of women whose mothers were exposed in utero to diethylstilbestrol (DES) | journal = International Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 862–8 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16723367 | doi = 10.1093/ije/dyl106 | url = http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/4/862.full.pdf+html }}</ref> A possible increased risk of infertility in the older, third generation daughters was also noted. The NCI study provides limited evidence of an increased risk of birth defects in the sons or daughters of women who were exposed prenatally to DES. An increased risk of ovarian cancer in the daughters of women exposed ''in utero'' was observed, but it was based on three cases of almost 800, so the finding is considered preliminary and requires further study.

Some evidence suggests the sons of prenatally DES-exposed women might have an increased risk of [[hypospadias]],<ref name="lancet">{{cite journal | vauthors = Klip H, Verloop J, van Gool JD, Koster ME, Burger CW, van Leeuwen FE | title = Hypospadias in sons of women exposed to diethylstilbestrol in utero: a cohort study | journal = Lancet | volume = 359 | issue = 9312 | pages = 1102–7 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11943257 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08152-7 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kalfa N, Paris F, Soyer-Gobillard MO, Daures JP, Sultan C | title = Prevalence of hypospadias in grandsons of women exposed to diethylstilbestrol during pregnancy: a multigenerational national cohort study | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 95 | issue = 8 | pages = 2574–7 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21458804 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2011.02.047 }}</ref> but other studies suggest the increase in risk might not be as great as once thought.<ref name="repro">{{cite journal | vauthors = Brouwers MM, Feitz WF, Roelofs LA, Kiemeney LA, de Gier RP, Roeleveld N | title = Hypospadias: a transgenerational effect of diethylstilbestrol? | journal = Human Reproduction | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 666–9 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16293648 | doi = 10.1093/humrep/dei398 }}</ref>

===Pharmacodynamics===

====Estrogenic activity====

As can be seen in the table above, similarly to [[ethinylestradiol]], DES shows a marked and disproportionately strong effect on [[Liver#Synthesis|hepatic protein production]].<ref name="pmid16112947" />

====Other activities====
DES has been identified as an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of all three [[isoform|isotypes]] of the [[estrogen-related receptor]]s (ERRs), the [[ERRα]], [[ERRβ]], and [[ERRγ]].<ref name="pmid15161930">{{cite journal | vauthors = Greschik H, Flaig R, Renaud JP, Moras D | title = Structural basis for the deactivation of the estrogen-related receptor gamma by diethylstilbestrol or 4-hydroxytamoxifen and determinants of selectivity | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 279 | issue = 32 | pages = 33639–46 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15161930 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M402195200 }}</ref>

In addition to the ERs, an ''[[in vitro]]'' study found that DES also possesses activity, albeit relatively weak, at a variety of other [[steroid hormone receptor]]s.<ref name="pmid22294742">{{cite journal | vauthors = Coss CC, Jones A, Parke DN, Narayanan R, Barrett CM, Kearbey JD, Veverka KA, Miller DD, Morton RA, Steiner MS, Dalton JT | title = Preclinical characterization of a novel diphenyl benzamide selective ERα agonist for hormone therapy in prostate cancer | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 153 | issue = 3 | pages = 1070–81 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22294742 | doi = 10.1210/en.2011-1608 }}</ref> Whereas the study found [[EC50|EC<sub>50</sub>]] values of 0.18&nbsp;nM and 0.06&nbsp;nM of DES for the ERα and ERβ, respectively, the drug showed significant [[glucocorticoid]] activity at a concentration of 1&nbsp;μm that surpassed that of 0.1&nbsp;nM [[dexamethasone]] as well as significant [[receptor antagonist|antagonism]] of the [[androgen receptor|androgen]], [[progesterone receptor|progesterone]], and [[mineralocorticoid receptor]]s (75%, 85%, and 50% inhibition of positive control stimulation, respectively, at a concentration of 1&nbsp;μm).<ref name="pmid22294742" /> It also showed approximately 25% inhibition of the activation of [[PPARγ]] and [[LXRα]] at a concentration of 10&nbsp;μm.<ref name="pmid22294742" /> The researchers stated that, to the best of their knowledge, they were the first to report such actions of DES, and hypothesized that these actions could be involved in the clinical effects of DES, for instance, in prostate cancer (notably in which particularly high dosages of DES are employed).<ref name="pmid22294742" /> However, they also noted that the importance of the activities requires further study in [[animal model]]s at [[pharmacology|pharmacologically]] relevant doses.<ref name="pmid22294742" />

==History==

===Synthesis===
DES was first synthesized in early 1938 by Leon Golberg, then a graduate student of [[Robert Robinson (organic chemist)|Sir Robert Robinson]] at the [[Dyson Perrins Laboratory]] at the [[University of Oxford]]. Golberg's research was based on work by Wilfrid Lawson at the Courtauld Institute of Biochemistry, (led by [[Charles Dodds|Sir Edward Charles Dodds]] at [[Middlesex Hospital#Middlesex Hospital Medical School|Middlesex Hospital Medical School]] now part of [[University College London]]). A report of its synthesis was published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' on 5 February 1938.<ref name=Dodds_1938>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dodds EC, Goldberg L, Lawson W, Robinson R | year =1938 | title = Estrogenic activity of certain synthetic compounds | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 141 | issue = 3562 | pages = 247–8 | doi = 10.1038/141247b0 }}</ref><ref name=dodds2>{{cite book | vauthors = Dodds EC | year = 1957 | title = Biochemical contributions to endocrinology; experiments in hormonal research | location = Stanford | publisher = Stanford University Press | oclc = 1483899}}</ref><ref name=meyers>{{cite book | vauthors = Meyers R | year = 1983 | title = D.E.S., the bitter pill | location = New York | publisher = Seaview/Putnam | isbn = 0-399-31008-8 }}</ref>

DES research was funded by the UK Medical Research Council [[Medical Research Council (UK)|(MRC)]], which had a policy against patenting drugs discovered using public funds. Because it was not patented, DES was produced by more than 200 pharmaceutical and chemical companies worldwide.

===Clinical use===
DES (in tablets up to 5&nbsp;mg) was approved by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration (FDA)]] on September 19, 1941 for four indications: [[gonorrhea]]l [[vaginitis]], [[atrophic vaginitis]], [[menopausal]] symptoms, and postpartum [[breastfeeding|lactation]] suppression to prevent breast engorgement.<ref name=meyers/> The gonorrheal vaginitis indication was dropped when the [[antibiotic]] [[penicillin]] became available. From its very inception, the drug was highly controversial.<ref name=langston>{{cite book | vauthors = Langston N | year = 2010 | title = Toxic bodies: Hormone disruptors and the legacy of DES |location=New Haven, CT | publisher = Yale University Press | isbn = 978-0-300-13607-4}}</ref><ref name=seaman>{{cite book | vauthors = Seaman B | year = 2003 | title = The greatest experiment ever performed on women: Exploding the estrogen myth | location = New York | publisher = Hyperion | isbn = 978-0-7868-6853-7 }}</ref>

In 1941, [[Charles Huggins]] and Clarence Hodges at the [[University of Chicago]] found DES to be the first effective drug for the treatment of metastatic [[prostate cancer]].<ref name="pmid4625049">{{cite journal | vauthors = Huggins C, Hodges CV | title = Studies on prostatic cancer.

[[Orchiectomy]] or DES or both were the standard initial treatment for symptomatic advanced prostate cancer for over 40 years, until the [[GnRH agonist]] [[leuprolide]] was found to have efficacy similar to DES without estrogenic effects and was approved in 1985.<ref name="pmid6436700">{{cite journal | vauthors = ((The Leuprolide Study Group)) | title = Leuprolide versus diethylstilbestrol for metastatic prostate cancer.  | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 311 | issue = 20 | pages = 1281–6 | date = November 1984 | pmid = 6436700 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM198411153112004 }}</ref>

From the 1940s until the late 1980s, DES was FDA-approved as [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|estrogen-replacement therapy]] for estrogen deficiency states such as [[gonadal dysgenesis|ovarian dysgenesis]], [[premature ovarian failure]], and after [[oophorectomy]].

In the 1940s, DES was used off-label to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with a history of miscarriage. On July 1, 1947, the FDA approved the use of DES for this indication. The first such approval was granted to [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]], allowing use of 25&nbsp;mg (and later 100&nbsp;mg) tablets of DES during pregnancy. Approvals were granted to other pharmaceutical companies later in the same year.<ref name=dutton>{{cite book | vauthors = Dutton DB | year = 1988 | title = Worse than the disease: pitfalls of medical progress | location = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 0-521-34023-3}}</ref> The recommended regimen started at 5&nbsp;mg per day in the seventh and eighth weeks of pregnancy (from first day of last menstrual period), increased every other week by 5&nbsp;mg per day through the 14th week, and then increased every week by 5&nbsp;mg per day from 25&nbsp;mg per day in the 15th week to 125&nbsp;mg per day in the 35th week of pregnancy.<ref name=pdr1961>{{cite book | year = 1961 | title = Physicians' desk reference to pharmaceutical specialties and biologicals | edition = 15th | location = Oradell NJ | publisher = Medical Economics | page = 625 | isbn = 0-00-093447-X }}</ref> 
DES was originally considered effective and safe for both the [[pregnancy|pregnant]] woman and the developing baby. It was aggressively marketed and routinely prescribed. Sales peaked in 1953.

In the early 1950s, a [[double-blind]] clinical trial at the University of Chicago assessed pregnancy outcomes in women who were assigned to either receive or not receive DES.<ref name=dieckmann>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dieckmann WJ, Davis ME, Rynkiewicz LM, Pottinger RE | title = Does the administration of diethylstilbestrol during pregnancy have therapeutic value? | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 66 | issue = 5 | pages = 1062–81 | date = November 1953 | pmid = 13104505 }}</ref> 
The study showed no benefit of taking DES during pregnancy; adverse pregnancy outcomes were not reduced in the women who were given DES. By the late 1960s, six of seven leading textbooks of obstetrics said DES was ineffective at preventing miscarriage.<ref name=dutton/><ref name=apfel>{{cite book | vauthors = Apfel RJ, Fisher SM | year = 1984 | title = To do no harm: DES and the dilemmas of modern medicine | location = New Haven | publisher = Yale University Press | isbn = 0-300-03192-0 }}</ref>

Despite an absence of evidence supporting the use of DES to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes, DES continued to be given to pregnant women through the 1960s. In 1971, a report published in the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' showed a probable link between DES and vaginal [[Clear-cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina|clear cell adenocarcinoma]] in girls and young women who had been exposed to this drug ''in utero''. Later in the same year, the FDA sent an FDA Drug Bulletin to all U.S. physicians advising against the use of DES in pregnant women. The FDA also removed prevention of miscarriage as an indication for DES use and added pregnancy as a contraindication for DES use.<ref name=fr1971>{{cite journal | vauthors = ((United States Food and Drug Administration)) | year = 1971 | title = Certain estrogens for oral or parenteral use.

DES was also used in other countries, most notably France, the Netherlands, and Great Britain.

From the 1950s through the beginning of the 1970s, DES was prescribed to prepubescent girls to begin puberty and thus stop growth by closing growth plates in the bones. Despite its clear link to cancer, doctors continued to recommend the hormone for "excess height".<ref>{{cite web | vauthors = Zuger A | date = 2009-07-27 | title = At What Height, Happiness?

In 1973, in an attempt to restrict [[off-label use]] of DES as a [[emergency contraceptive|postcoital contraceptive]] (which had become prevalent at many university health services following publication of an influential study in 1971 in ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]]'') to emergency situations such as rape, an ''FDA Drug Bulletin'' was sent to all U.S. physicians and pharmacists that said the FDA had approved, under restricted conditions, postcoital contraceptive use of DES.<ref name="pmid5171004">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuchera LK | title = Postcoital contraception with diethylstilbestrol | journal = JAMA | volume = 218 | issue = 4 | pages = 562–3 | date = October 1971 | pmid = 5171004 | doi = 10.1001/jama.218.4.562 }}</ref>

In 1975, the FDA said it had not actually given (and never did give) approval to any manufacturer to market DES as a postcoital contraceptive, but would approve that indication for emergency situations such as rape or incest if a manufacturer provided patient labeling and special packaging as set out in a FDA final rule published in 1975.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = FDA | year = 1975 | title = Diethylstilbestrol as posticoital oral contraceptive; patient labeling | journal = Fed Regist | volume = 40 | issue = 25 | pages = 5451–5 }}; {{Federal Register|40|5451}}</ref> To discourage off-label use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive, the FDA in 1975 removed DES 25&nbsp;mg tablets from the market and ordered the labeling of lower doses (5&nbsp;mg and lower) of DES still approved for other indications changed to state: "This drug product should not be used as a postcoital contraceptive" in block capital letters on the first line of the physician prescribing information package insert and in a prominent and conspicuous location of the container and carton label.<ref name=des25mg>{{cite journal | vauthors = FDA | year = 1975 | title = Certain estrogens for oral use.

In 1978, the FDA removed postpartum [[lactation suppression]] to prevent breast engorgement from their approved indications for DES and other estrogens.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = FDA | year = 1978 | title = Estrogens for postpartum breast engorgement | journal = Fed Regist | volume = 43 | issue = 206 | pages = 49564–7 }}; {{Federal Register|43|49564}}</ref> In the 1990s, the only approved indications for DES were treatment of advanced prostate cancer and treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women. The last remaining U.S. manufacturer of DES, [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]], stopped making and marketing it in 1997.

===Lawsuits===
In the 1970s, the negative publicity surrounding the discovery of DES's long-term effects resulted in a huge wave of lawsuits in the United States against its manufacturers. These culminated in a landmark 1980 decision of the [[Supreme Court of California]], ''[[Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories]]'', in which the court imposed a [[rebuttable presumption]] of [[market share liability]] upon all DES manufacturers, proportional to their share of the market at the time the drug was consumed by the mother of a particular plaintiff.

A lawsuit was filed in Boston Federal Court by 53 DES daughters who say their breast cancers were the result of DES being prescribed to their mothers while pregnant with them.  Their cases survived a [[Daubert]] hearing.  In 2013, the Fecho sisters who initiated the breast cancer/DES link litigation agreed to an undisclosed settlement amount on the second day of trial. The remaining litigants have received various settlements.<ref>{{cite news|last=LAVOIE|first=DENISE|title=DES Pregnancy Drug Lawsuit: Settlement Reached Between Melnick Sisters And Eli Lilly And Co.|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/09/des-pregnancy-drug-lawsuit-melnick-sisters_n_2442937.html|accessdate=19 March 2014|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=9 January 2013}}</ref>

==Society and culture==
[[Alan Turing]], the ground breaking cryptographer, founder of computing science and programmable computers, who also proposed the actual theoretical model of biological morphogenesis,  was placed on the medication to induce chemical castration as a treatment for his homosexuality shortly before he committed suicide.<ref>{{cite web | last1 = West-Taylor | first1 = Zoe | name-list-format = vanc | title = The Alan Turing Law – a Formal Pardon for Unpardonable Homophobia | url = http://affinitymagazine.us/2016/09/24/the-alan-turing-law-a-formal-pardon-for-unpardonable-homophobia/|website=Affinity magazine | accessdate = 3 December 2016 }}</ref>

==Veterinary use==

===Female canine incontinence===
DES has been very successful in treating female canine incontinence stemming from poor sphincter control. It is still available from compounding pharmacies, and at the low (1&nbsp;mg) dose, does not have the carcinogenic properties that were so problematic in humans.<ref>{{cite web|title=Urinary Incontinence|url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/191024.htm|work=Merck Veterinary Manual|publisher=[[Merck Veterinary Manual]]|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref>  It is generally administered once a day for seven to ten days and then once every week as needed.

===Growth promotion in livestock===
The greatest usage of DES was in the livestock industry, used to improve [[Feed conversion ratio|feed conversion]] in beef and poultry. During the 1960s, DES was used as a [[growth hormone]] in the beef and poultry industries. It was later found to cause cancer by 1971, but was not phased out until 1979.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Harris RM, Waring RH | title = Diethylstilboestrol--a long-term legacy | journal = Maturitas | volume = 72 | issue = 2 | pages = 108–12 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22464649 | doi = 10.1016/j.maturitas.2012.03.002 }}</ref><ref name="urlenvirocancer.cornell.edu">{{cite web | url = http://envirocancer.cornell.edu/factsheet/diet/fs37.hormones.cfm | title = Consumer Concerns About Hormones in Food | vauthors = Gandhi R, Snedeker S | date = 2000-06-01 | work = Fact Sheet #37, June 2000 | publisher = Program on Breast Cancer and Environmental Risk Factors, Cornell University | accessdate = 2011-07-20 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110719175735/http://envirocancer.cornell.edu/Factsheet/Diet/fs37.hormones.cfm | archivedate = 2011-07-19 | df =  }}</ref> When DES was discovered to be harmful to humans, it was moved to veterinary use.
