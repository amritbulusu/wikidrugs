==Medical uses==
Lamivudine has been used for treatment of chronic [[hepatitis B]] at a lower dose than for treatment of [[HIV/AIDS]]. It improves the [[seroconversion]] of e-antigen positive hepatitis B and also improves histology staging of the liver. Long-term use of lamivudine leads to emergence of a resistant hepatitis B virus (YMDD) mutant. Despite this, lamivudine is still used widely as it is well tolerated.

===Resistance===
{{See also|resistance mutation}}
In HIV, high level resistance is associated with the M184V/I mutation in the [[reverse transcriptase]] gene as reported by Raymond Schinazi's group at [[Emory University]]. [[GlaxoSmithKline]] claimed that the M184V mutation reduces "viral fitness", because of the finding that continued lamivudine treatment causes the HIV viral load to rebound but at a much lower level, and that withdrawal of lamivudine results in a higher viral load rebound with rapid loss of the M184V mutation; GSK therefore argued that there may be benefit in continuing lamivudine treatment even in the presence of high level resistance, because the resistant virus is "less fit".  The COLATE study has suggested that there is no benefit to continuing lamivudine treatment in patients with lamivudine resistance.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Fox Z | title=A randomized trial to evaluate continuation versus discontinuation of lamivudine in individuals failing a lamivudine-containing regimen: The COLATE trial | journal=Antiviral Therapy | volume=11 | pages=761&ndash;70 | year=2006 | pmid=17310820 | issue=6 |name-list-format=vanc| author2=Dragsted UB | author3=Gerstoft J | display-authors=3 | last4=Phillips | first4=AN | last5=Kjaer | first5=J | last6=Mathiesen | first6=L | last7=Youle | first7=M | last8=Katlama | first8=C | last9=Hill | first9=A }}</ref>  A better explanation of the data is that lamivudine continues to have a partial anti-viral effect even in the presence of the M184V mutation.

In hepatitis B, lamivudine resistance was first described in the YMDD ([[tyrosine]]-[[methionine]]-[[aspartate]]-aspartate) locus of the HBV reverse transcriptase gene.  The HBV reverse transcriptase gene is 344 amino acids long and occupies codons 349 to 692 on the viral genome.  The most commonly encountered resistance mutations are M204V/I/S.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hivdb.stanford.edu/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701092825/http://hivdb.stanford.edu/index.html |archivedate=2010-07-01 |df= }} ''Stanford University Drug Resistance Database''.</ref> The change in amino acid sequence from YMDD to YIDD results in a 3.2 fold reduction in the error rate of the reverse transcriptase, which correlates with a significant growth disadvantage of the virus. Other resistance mutations are L80V/I, V173L and L180M.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Koziel MJ, Peters MG | year=2007 | journal=N Engl J Med | volume=356 | pages=1445&ndash;54 | issue=14 | title=Viral hepatitis in HIV infection  | doi=10.1056/NEJMra065142 | pmid=17409326}}</ref>

==Side effects==
# Minor side effects may include [[nausea]], [[Fatigue_(medical)|fatigue]], [[headaches]], [[diarrhea]], [[cough]] and [[nasal congestion]].
# Do not prescribe lamivudine/zidovudine, abacavir/lamivudine, or abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine to patients taking [[emtricitabine]].
# Long-term use of lamivudine can trigger a resistant [[hepatitis B virus]] (YMDD) mutant.
# HIV or HBV-infected women on lamivudine are warned to discontinue [[breastfeeding]] as this puts the baby at risk for HIV transmission and medication side effects. 
# Patients who are infected with [[HIV]] and [[Hepatitis_C_virus|HCV]] and are on both [[interferon]] and lamivudine can experience liver damage. 
# The drug can trigger an [[inflammatory response]] to opportunistic infections (e.g., [[Mycobacterium avium complex]] [MAC], M. [[tuberculosis]], [[cytomegalovirus]] [CMV], [[Pneumocystis]] jirovecii [formerly P. carinii).
# [[Autoimmune]] disorders have been reported and [[symptoms]] can occur many months after initiation of the [[antiretroviral]] therapy.
# Use with caution for patients with impaired [[renal]] function and do not prescribe this treatment to patients with impaired [[hepatic]] function.

==Mechanism of action==
Lamivudine is an [[analog (chemistry)|analogue]] of [[cytidine]]. It can inhibit both types (1 and 2) of [[HIV]] [[reverse transcriptase]] and also the reverse transcriptase of [[hepatitis B virus]].  It is phosphorylated to active metabolites that compete for incorporation into viral DNA. They inhibit the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme competitively and act as a chain terminator of DNA synthesis. The lack of a 3'-OH group in the incorporated nucleoside analogue prevents the formation of the 5' to 3' phosphodiester linkage essential for DNA chain elongation, and therefore, the viral DNA growth is terminated.

Lamivudine is administered by mouth, and it is rapidly absorbed with a bio-availability of over 80%. Some research suggests that lamivudine can cross the [[blood–brain barrier]]. Lamivudine is often given in combination with [[zidovudine]], with which it is highly synergistic. Lamivudine treatment has been shown to restore zidovudine sensitivity of previously resistant HIV. Lamivudine showed no evidence of [[carcinogen]]icity or [[mutagen]]icity in ''in vivo'' studies in mice and rats at doses from 10 to 58 times those used in humans.<ref name="package-insert">{{cite web | url = http://us.gsk.com/products/assets/us_epivir.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = [[GlaxoSmithKline]] | title = Epivir package insert | accessdate = January 20, 2011 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928062844/http://us.gsk.com/products/assets/us_epivir.pdf | archivedate = September 28, 2011 | df =  }}</ref>

It has a [[half-life]] of 5-7 hours in adults and 2 hours in HIV-infected children. 

==History==
Racemic BCH-189 (the minus form is known as lamivudine) was invented by [[Bernard Belleau]] while at work at [[McGill University]] and Paul Nguyen-Ba at the Montreal-based IAF BioChem International, Inc. laboratories in 1988 and the minus enantiomer isolated in 1989. Samples were first sent to Yung-Chi Cheng of [[ Yale University]] for study of its toxicity. When used in combination with AZT, he discovered that lamivudine's negative form reduced side effects and increased the drug's efficiency at inhibiting reverse transcriptase.<ref>{{cite web| title=US Patent Office| url=http://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/ip/boards/bpai/decisions/inform/104523-58.pdf| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616180439/http://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/ip/boards/bpai/decisions/inform/104523-58.pdf| archivedate=2016-06-16| df=}}</ref>The combination of lamivudine and AZT increased the efficiency at inhibiting an enzyme HIV uses to reproduce its genetic material. As a result, lamivudine was identified as a less toxic agent to mitochondria DNA than other retroviral drugs.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sodestrom|first1=Jon|title=National Institutes of Health: Moving Research from the Bench to the Bedside|url=https://www.aau.edu/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2626|date=2003|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024056/https://www.aau.edu/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2626|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Wide-Ranging Effects of Nucleoside Analogs:A Look at Mitochondrial Toxicity|url=http://www.thebody.com/content/art2633.html?|last1=Gilden|first1=Dave|date=2000|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916214133/http://www.thebody.com/content/art2633.html|archivedate=2016-09-16|df=}}</ref>

Lamivudine was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) on November 17, 1995 for use with [[zidovudine]] (AZT) and again in 2002 as a once-a-day dosed medication.
