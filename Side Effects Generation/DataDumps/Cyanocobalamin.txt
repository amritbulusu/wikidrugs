'''Cyanocobalamin''' is a synthetic form of [[Vitamin B12|vitamin {{chem|B|12}}]]. Vitamin {{chem|B|12}} is the "generic descriptor" name for any [[vitamer]]s of vitamin {{chem|B|12}}. Because humans and animals can convert cyanocobalamin to any one of the active vitamin {{chem|B|12}} compounds,{{R|PMC2809139}} by definition this makes cyanocobalamin itself a form (or vitamer) of {{chem|B|12}}.

==Medical use==
Cyanocobalamin is usually prescribed after surgical removal of part or all of the [[stomach]] or [[intestine]] to ensure adequate serum levels of vitamin {{chem|B|12}}. It is also used to treat [[pernicious anemia]], vitamin {{chem|B|12}} deficiency (due to low intake from food), [[thyrotoxicosis]], [[hemorrhage]], [[malignancy]], liver disease and kidney disease. Cyanocobalamin injections are often prescribed to [[gastric bypass]] patients who have had part of their [[small intestine]] bypassed, making it difficult for {{chem|B|12}} to be acquired via food or vitamins. Cyanocobamide is also used to perform the [[Schilling test]] to check ability to absorb vitamin {{chem|B|12}}.{{R|umm}}

==Side effects==
Possible side effects of cyanocobalamin injection include allergic reactions such as [[hives]], difficult breathing; redness of the face; swelling of the arms, hands, feet, ankles or lower legs; extreme thirst; and [[diarrhea]]. Less-serious side effects may include headache, dizziness, leg pain, [[itching]], or [[rash]].{{R|Sides2}}

Treatment of [[megaloblastic anemia]] with concurrent vitamin {{chem|B|12}} deficiency using {{chem|B|12}} vitamers (including cyanocobalamin), creates the possibility of [[hypokalemia]] due to increased [[erythropoiesis]] (red blood cell production) and consequent cellular uptake of [[potassium]] upon anemia resolution.{{R|Anemia}} When treated with vitamin {{chem|B|12}}, patients with [[Leber's disease]] may suffer serious [[optic atrophy]], possibly leading to blindness.{{R|blind}}

==Chemistry==
Cyanocobalamin is one of the most widely manufactured [[vitamer]]s in the vitamin {{chem|B|12}} family (the family of chemicals that function as {{chem|B|12}} when put into the body), because cyanocobalamin is the most{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} air-stable of the {{chem|B|12}} forms. It is the easiest{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} to crystallize and therefore easiest{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} to purify after it is produced by [[bacterial fermentation]], or [[Vitamin B12 total synthesis|synthesized ''in vitro'']].  It can be obtained as dark red crystals or as an amorphous red powder. Cyanocobalamin is [[hygroscopic]] in the [[anhydrous]] form, and sparingly soluble in water (1:80). It is stable to [[autoclaving]] for short periods at {{convert|121|C|F}}. The vitamin {{chem|B|12}} [[coenzymes]] are unstable in light. After consumption the cyanide [[ligand]] is replaced by other groups ([[adenosyl]], [[methyl]]), which are the biologically active forms.  The [[cyanide]] is excreted{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}.

===Chemical reactions===

In the cobalamins, [[cobalt]] normally exists in the trivalent state, Co(III). However, under reducing conditions, the cobalt center is reduced to Co(II) or even Co(I), which are usually denoted as {{chem|B|12r}}and {{chem|B|12s}}, for reduced and super reduced, respectively.

{{chem|B|12r}} and {{chem|B|12s}} can be prepared from cyanocobalamin by controlled potential reduction, or chemical reduction using [[sodium borohydride]] in alkaline solution, [[zinc]] in [[acetic acid]], or by the action of [[thiols]]. Both {{chem|B|12r}} and {{chem|B|12s}}are stable indefinitely under oxygen-free conditions. {{chem|B|12r}} appears orange-brown in solution, while {{chem|B|12s}}appears bluish-green under natural daylight, and purple under artificial light.{{R|MechB12}}

{{chem|B|12s}}is one of the most nucleophilic species known in aqueous solution. This property allows the convenient preparation of cobalamin analogs with different [[substituents]], via [[nucleophilic]] attack on [[alkyl halide]]s and vinyl halides.{{R|MechB12}}

For example, cyanocobalamin can be converted to its analog cobalamins via reduction to {{chem|B|12s}}, followed by the addition of the corresponding [[alkyl halides]], [[acyl halides]], [[alkene]] or [[alkyne]]. [[Steric hindrance]] is the major limiting factor in the synthesis of the {{chem|B|12}} coenzyme analogs. For example, no reaction occurs between [[neopentyl]] chloride and {{chem|B|12s}}, whereas the secondary alkyl halide analogs are too unstable to be isolated.{{R|MechB12}} This effect may be due to the strong coordination between [[benzimidazole]] and the central cobalt atom, pulling it down into the plane of [[corrin]] ring. The [[trans effect]] determines the polarizability of the Co-C bond so formed. However, once the [[benzimidazole]] is detached from cobalt by quaternization with [[methyl iodide]], it is replaced by {{chem|H|2|O}} or [[hydroxyl]] ions. Various secondary alkyl halides are then readily attacked by the modified {{chem|B|12s}}to give the corresponding stable cobalamin analogs.{{R|InnoCatalyst}} The products are usually extracted and purified by phenol-methylene chloride extraction or by column chromatography.{{R|MechB12}}

Cobalamin analogs prepared by this method include the naturally occurring coenzymes [[methylcobalamin]] and [[cobamamide]], and other cobalamins that do not occur naturally, such as vinylcobalamin, carboxymethylcobalamin and cyclohexylcobalamin.{{R|MechB12}} This reaction is under review for use as a catalyst for [[chemical dehalogenation]], organic reagent and photosensitized catalyst systems.{{R|Catalysis}}

[[File:Various reduced forms of Cyanocobalamin.jpg|thumb|none|300px|Reduced forms of Cyanocobalamin, with a Co(I) (upper) center, Co(II) (middle) center, and Co(III) (lower) center]]

==Production==
Cyanocobalamin is commercially prepared by [[bacterial fermentation]]. Fermentation by a variety of [[microorganism]]s yields a mixture of methyl-, hydroxo- and [[adenosylcobalamin]]. These compounds are converted to cyanocobalamin by addition of [[potassium cyanide]] in the presence of [[sodium nitrite]] and heat. Since multiple species of [[Propionibacterium]] produce no [[exotoxin]]s or [[endotoxin]]s and have been granted [[GRAS]] status (generally regarded as safe) by the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]], they are the preferred bacterial fermentation organisms for vitamin {{chem|B|12}} production.{{R|Riaz}}

Historically, a form of vitamin {{chem|B|12}} called [[hydroxocobalamin]] is often produced by bacteria and was then changed to cyanocobalamin during purification in [[activated charcoal]] columns after separation from the bacterial cultures. This change was not immediately realized when vitamin {{chem|B|12}} was first extracted for characterization. [[Cyanide]] is naturally present in activated charcoal. Hydroxocobalamin, which has affinity for cyanide, picks it up and changes to cyanocobalamin. Cyanocobalamin is the form in most pharmaceutical preparations because adding cyanide stabilizes the molecule.{{R|herbert}}

As of 2000 France accounted for 80% of the world's 10+ tonnes/year of production. 55% of sales is destined for animal feed, while the remaining 45% is for human consumption.{{R|Ullmann}}

== Metabolism ==
The two bioactive forms of vitamin {{chem|B|12r}} are [[methylcobalamin]] in [[cytosol]] and [[adenosylcobalamin]] in [[mitochondria]]. Multivitamins often contain cyanocobalamin, which is presumably converted to bioactive forms in the body. Both methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin are commercially available as supplement pills. The [[MMACHC]] gene product catalyzes the decyanation of cyanocobalamin as well as the dealkylation of alkylcobalamins including methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin.{{R|Hannibal}} This function has also been attributed to [[Cyanocobalamin reductase (cyanide-eliminating)|cobalamin reductases]].{{R|Watanabe}} The MMACHC gene product and cobalamin reductases enable the interconversion of cyano- and alkylcobalamins.{{R|Quadros}}

B12 cyanocobalamin is added to fortify{{R|DSM-fortify}} nutrition, including baby milk powder, breakfast cereals and energy drinks for humans, also animal feed for poultry, swine and fish. Vitamin {{chem|B|12}} becomes inactive due to [[Hydrogen cyanide]] and [[Nitric oxide]] in cigarette smoke. Vitamin {{chem|B|12}} also becomes inactive due to [[Nitrous oxide]] {{chem|N|2|O}} commonly known as laughing gas, used for [[anaesthesia]] and abused as a recreational drug.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Thompson AG, Leite MI, Lunn MP, Bennett DL |title=Whippits, nitrous oxide and the dangers of legal highs |journal=Pract Neurol |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=207–9 |year=2015 |pmid=25977272 |pmc=4453489 |doi=10.1136/practneurol-2014-001071 |url=}}</ref> Vitamin {{chem|B|12}} becomes inactive due to microwaving or other forms of heating.{{R|Watanabe2}}

=== In the cytosol ===
Vitamin {{chem|B|12}} [[methylcobalamin]] and [[5-methyltetrahydrofolate]] are needed by [[Methionine synthase]] in the [[Methionine]] cycle to transfer a methyl group from [[5-methyltetrahydrofolate]] to [[homocysteine]], thereby generating [[tetrahydrofolate]] (THF) and [[methionine]], which is used to make [[SAMe]]. [[SAMe]] is the universal methyl donor and is used for [[DNA methylation]] and to make [[Lipid bilayer|phospholipid]] [[Cell membrane|membranes]], [[choline]], [[sphingomyelin]] and [[acetylcholine]] and other [[neurotransmitters]].

=== In mitochondria ===
[[File:Odd-chain FA oxydation.png|thumb|upright|Vitamin B12 [[adenosylcobalamin]] in [[mitochondrion]]—cholesterol and protein metabolism]]

The enzymes that use {{chem|B|12}} as a built-in cofactor are [[methylmalonyl-CoA mutase]] ([[Protein Data Bank|PDB]] 4REQ{{R|4REQ}}) and [[methionine synthase]] ([[Protein Data Bank|PDB]] 1Q8J).{{R|1Q8J}}

The metabolism of [[propionyl-CoA]] occurs in the mitochondria and requires Vitamin {{chem|B|12}} (as [[adenosylcobalamin]]) to make [[succinyl-CoA]]. When the conversion of propionyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA in the mitochondria fails due to Vitamin {{chem|B|12}} deficiency, elevated blood levels of [[methylmalonic acid]] (MMA) occur. Thus, elevated blood levels of [[homocysteine]] and MMA may both be indicators of [[vitamin B12 deficiency|Vitamin {{chem|B|12}} deficiency]].

Vitamin {{chem|B|12}} [[adenosylcobalamin]] is needed as [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] in [[methylmalonyl-CoA mutase]]—MUT enzyme. Processing of cholesterol and protein gives [[propionyl-CoA]] that is converted to [[methylmalonyl-CoA]], which is used by [[methylmalonyl-CoA mutase|MUT enzyme]] to make [[succinyl-CoA]]. Vitamin {{chem|B|12}} is needed to prevent anemia, since making [[porphyrin]] and [[heme]] in [[mitochondria]] for producing hemoglobin in red blood cells depends on [[succinyl-CoA]] made by vitamin {{chem|B|12}}.

=== Absorption and transport ===
Poor absorption of vitamin {{chem|B|12}} may be related to [[coeliac disease]]. Intestinal absorption of vitamin {{chem|B|12}} requires successively three different protein molecules: [[Haptocorrin]], [[Intrinsic Factor]] and [[Transcobalamin II]].
