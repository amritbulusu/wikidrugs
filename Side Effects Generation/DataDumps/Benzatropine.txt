'''Benzatropine''', also known as '''benztropine''', is an [[anticholinergic]] marketed under the [[trade name]] '''Cogentin''' which is used in the treatment of [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Parkinsonism]], and [[dystonia]].

== Medical uses ==
Benzatropine is an [[anticholinergic]] drug used in patients to reduce the side effects of [[antipsychotic]] treatment. Benzatropine is also a second-line drug for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. It improves [[tremor]], and may alleviate rigidity and [[bradykinesia]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}. Benzatropine is also sometimes used for the treatment of [[dystonia]], a rare disorder that causes abnormal muscle contraction, resulting in twisting postures of limbs, trunk, or face. In veterinary medicine, benzatropine is used to treat [[priapism]] in stallions.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=DV|last2=Nickels|first2=FA|last3=Williams|first3=MA|title=Pharmacologic treatment of priapism in two horses|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|date=1 Nov 1991|pages=1183–4|accessdate=}}</ref>

== Adverse effects ==
These are principally anticholinergic:

* [[Dry mouth]]
* Blurred vision
* Cognitive changes
* [[Constipation]]
* [[Urinary retention]]
* [[Tachycardia]]
* [[Anorexia (symptom)|Anorexia]]
* Severe [[delirium]] and [[hallucinations]] (in overdose)

While some studies suggest that use of anticholinergics increases the risk of [[tardive dyskinesia]] (a long-term side effect of antipsychotics),<ref>{{ Cite journal |vauthors=Kane JM, Smith JM | title = Tardive dyskinesia: Prevalence and risk factors, 1959 to 1979 | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | year = 1982 | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 473–81 | pmid = 6121548 | doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1982.04290040069010}}</ref><ref name="pmid11534539">{{cite journal |vauthors=Wszola BA, Newell KM, Sprague RL | title = Risk factors for tardive dyskinesia in a large population of youths and adults | journal = Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology | year = 2001 | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 285–96 | pmid = 11534539 | doi = 10.1037/1064-1297.9.3.285 }}</ref> other studies have found no association between anticholinergic exposure and risk of developing tardive dyskinesia,<ref name="pmid9546009">{{cite journal |vauthors=van Harten PN, Hoek HW, Matroos GE, Koeter M, Kahn RS | title = Intermittent neuroleptic treatment and risk for tardive dyskinesia: Curaçao Extrapyramidal Syndromes Study III | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | year = 1998 | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 565–7 | pmid = 9546009 }}</ref> although symptoms may be worsened.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Yassa R | title = Tardive dyskinesia and anticholinergic drugs.

Drugs that decrease cholinergic transmission may impair storage of new information into long-term memory.

== Pharmacology ==
Benzatropine is a centrally acting [[anticholinergic]]/[[antihistamine]] agent. It is a selective M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. Benzatropine partially blocks cholinergic activity in the basal ganglia and has also been shown to increase the availability of dopamine by blocking its reuptake and storage in central sites, and as a result, increasing dopaminergic activity. Animal studies have indicated that anticholinergic activity of benzatropine is approximately one-half that of atropine, while its antihistamine activity approaches that of [[mepyramine]]. Its anticholinergic effects have been established as therapeutically significant in the management of Parkinsonism. Benzatropine antagonizes the effect of [[acetylcholine]], decreasing the imbalance between the neurotransmitters acetylcholine and [[dopamine]], which may improve the symptoms of early Parkinson's disease.<ref>MIMS Australia Pty Ltd. MIMS.</ref>

Benzatropine analogues are atypical [[dopamine reuptake inhibitors]],<ref name="pmid24194527 ">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hiranita T, Kohut SJ, Soto PL, Tanda G, Kopajtic TA, Katz JL | title = Preclinical efficacy of N-substituted benztropine analogs as antagonists of methamphetamine self-administration in rats| journal = J Pharmacol Exp Ther.| year = 2014 | volume = 348 | issue = 1 | pages = 174–91 | doi = 10.1124/jpet.113.208264 | pmid = 24194527 | pmc = 3868882 }}</ref> which might make them useful for people with [[akathisia]] secondary to antipsychotic therapy.<ref>{{cite journal | title = A controlled comparison of the effects of propranolol, benztropine, and placebo on akathisia: an interim analysis.| year = 1993 | pmid = 8290678 | volume=29 | journal=Psychopharmacol Bull | pages=283–6 | vauthors=Adler LA, Peselow E, Rosenthal M, Angrist B}}</ref>

Benzatropine also acts as a [[FIASMA|functional inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase]] (FIASMA).<ref name="pmid18504571">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kornhuber J, Muehlbacher M, Trapp S, Pechmann S, Friedl A, Reichel M, Mühle C, Terfloth L, Groemer T, Spitzer G, Liedl K, Gulbins E, Tripal P | title = Identification of novel functional inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase | journal = PLoS ONE | year = 2011 | volume = 6 | issue = 8 | pages = e23852 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0023852 | pmid = 21909365 | pmc = 3166082 }}</ref>

Benzatropine has been also identified, by a high throughput screening approach, as a potent differentiating agent for [[oligodendrocyte]]s, possibly working through [[M1 muscarinic receptor|M1]] and [[M3 muscarinic receptor|M3]] [[muscarinic receptor]]s. In preclinical models for multiple sclerosis, benzatropine decreased clinical symptoms and enhanced re-myelination.<ref name="pmid24107995">{{cite journal |vauthors=Deshmukh VA, Tardif V, Lyssiotis CA, Green CC, Kerman B, Kim HJ, Padmanabhan K, Swoboda JG, Ahmad I, Kondo T, Gage FH, Theofilopoulos AN, Lawson BR, Schultz PG, Lairson LL | title = A regenerative approach to the treatment of multiple sclerosis | journal = Nature | year = 2013 | volume = 502 | issue = 7471 | pages = 327–332 | doi = 10.1038/nature12647 | pmid = 24107995 | pmc=4431622}}</ref>
