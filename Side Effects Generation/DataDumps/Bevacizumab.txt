==Medical uses==

=== Colorectal cancer ===
Bevacizumab was approved by the FDA in February 2004 for use in metastatic [[colorectal cancer]] when used with standard chemotherapy treatment (as first-line treatment) and with 5-fluorouracil-based therapy for second-line metastatic colorectal cancer.

Bevacizumab has also been examined as an add on to other chemotherapy drugs in people with non-metastatic colon cancer. The data from two large randomized studies showed no benefit in preventing the cancer from returning and a potential to cause harm in this setting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/29/1/1.full |title=Lessons From the Adjuvant Bevacizumab Trial on Colon Cancer: What Next? |publisher=Jco.ascopubs.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}</ref>

It was approved by the [[European Medicines Agency|EMA]] in January 2005 for use in [[colorectal cancer]].<ref name=":0" />

=== Lung cancer ===
In 2006, the FDA approved bevacizumab for use in first-line advanced nonsquamous [[Non-small-cell lung carcinoma|non-small cell lung cancer]] in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy. The approval was based on the pivotal study E4599 (conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group), which demonstrated a 2-month improvement in overall survival in patients treated with bevacizumab (Sandler, et al. NEJM 2004). A preplanned analysis of histology in E4599 demonstrated a 4-month median survival benefit with bevacizumab for patients with adenocarcinoma (Sandler, et al. JTO 2010); adenocarcinoma represents approximately 85% of all non-squamous cell carcinomas of the lung.
A subsequent European clinical trial, AVAiL, was first reported in 2009 and confirmed the significant improvement in progression-free survival shown in E4599 (Reck, et al. Ann. Oncol. 2010). An overall survival benefit was not demonstrated in patients treated with bevacizumab; however, this may be due to the more limited use of bevacizumab as maintenance treatment in AVAiL versus E4599 (this differential effect is also apparent in the European vs US trials of bevacizumab in colorectal cancer: Tyagi and Grothey, Clin Colorectal Cancer, 2006). As an anti-angiogenic agent, there is no mechanistic rationale for stopping bevacizumab before disease progression. Stated another way, the survival benefits achieved with bevacizumab can only be expected when used in accordance with the clinical evidence: continued until disease progression or treatment-limiting side effects.
Another large European-based clinical trial with bevacizumab in lung cancer, AVAPERL, was reported in October 2011 (Barlesi, et al. ECCM 2011). First-line patients were treated with bevacizumab plus cisplatin/pemetrexed for four cycles, and then randomized to receive maintenance treatment with either bevacizumab/pemetrexed or bevacizumab alone until disease progression. Maintenance treatment with bevacizumab/pemetrexed demonstrated a 50% reduction in risk of progression vs bevacizumab alone (median PFS: 10.2 vs 6.6 months, HR 0.50, p<0.001).
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends bevacizumab as standard first-line treatment in combination with any platinum-based chemotherapy, followed by maintenance bevacizumab until disease progression. Higher doses are usually given with carboplatin-based chemotherapy, whereas the lower dose is usually given with cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

=== Breast cancer ===
In December 2010, the FDA removed the breast cancer indication from bevacizumab, saying that it had not been shown to be safe and effective in [[breast cancer]] patients. The combined data from four different clinical trials showed that bevacizumab neither prolonged overall survival nor slowed disease progression sufficiently to outweigh the risk it presents to patients. This only prevented Genentech from marketing bevacizumab for breast cancer. Doctors are free to prescribe bevacizumab off label, although insurance companies are less likely to approve off-label treatments.<ref name="FDA breast1">{{cite press release| title=FDA begins process to remove breast cancer indication from Avastin label| publisher=FDA |date=2010-12-16| url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm237172.htm |accessdate=2010-12-17}}

A panel of cancer experts ruled for a second time that Avastin, the best-selling cancer drug in the world, should no longer be used in breast cancer patients, clearing the way for the U.S. government to remove its endorsement from the drug. The June 2011 meeting of the FDA's oncologic drug advisory committee was the last step in an appeal by the drug's maker.  The committee concluded that breast cancer clinical studies of patients taking Avastin have shown no advantage in survival rates, no improvement in quality of life, and significant side effects.  Patient support groups were disappointed by the committee's decision.<ref name=scijul11>{{cite journal|author1=Jennifer Couzin-Frankel |author2=Yasmin Ogale |title= Once on 'Fast Track', Avastin Now Derailed |journal=Science|pages= 143–4 |volume= 333 |date= 8 July 2011|doi=10.1126/science.333.6039.143|issue= 6039|pmid= 21737712 }}</ref>

On October 11, 2011, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) announced that the agency is revoking the agency’s approval of the breast cancer indication for bevacizumab after concluding that the drug has not been shown to be safe and effective for that use.

=== Renal cancers ===
In certain renal (kidney) cancers, bevacizumab improves the progression free survival time but not survival time. In 2009, the FDA approved bevacizumab for use in metastatic [[renal cell carcinoma|renal cell cancer]] (a form of [[kidney cancer]]).<ref>{{cite news |title=FDA clears Genentech drug for kidney cancer |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=August 2, 2009 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2009/08/02/financial/f190253D65.DTL |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930173358/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2009%2F08%2F02%2Ffinancial%2Ff190253D65.DTL |archivedate=September 30, 2010 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/news/bnitem.aspx?name=59562374 |title=FDA Gives Roche's Avastin the Go-Ahead for Metastatic Renal Carcinoma |publisher=Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News |work=GENNewsHighlights |date=August 3, 2009 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref> following earlier reports of activity<ref>{{cite journal |pages=1098–106 |doi=10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1989 |title=Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-Targeted Therapy in Renal Cell Carcinoma: Current Status and Future Directions |year=2007 |last1=Rini |first1=B.

===Eye disease===
Many diseases of the eye, such as [[age-related macular degeneration]] (AMD) and [[diabetic retinopathy]], damage the [[retina]] and cause blindness when blood vessels around the retina grow abnormally and leak fluid, causing the layers of the retina to separate. This abnormal growth is caused by VEGF, so bevacizumab has been successfully used to inhibit VEGF and slow this growth.

Bevacizumab has recently been used by ophthalmologists in an [[off-label use]] as an [[vitreous humour|intravitreal agent]] in the treatment of proliferative (neovascular) eye diseases, particularly for [[choroidal neovascularization|choroidal neovascular membrane]] (CNV) in AMD. Although not currently approved by the FDA for such use, the injection of 1.25-2.5&nbsp;mg of bevacizumab into the vitreous cavity has been performed without significant intraocular toxicity.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Arevalo, JF | year = 2008 | title = Primary intravitreal bevacizumab for subfoveal choroidal neovascularization in age-related macular degenation: results of the Pan-American Collaborative Retina Study Group at 12 months follow up | journal = Retina | volume = 28 | pages = 1387–94 | pmid = 18827735 | issue = 10 | doi = 10.1097/IAE.0b013e3181884ff4| last2 = Fromow-Guerra | first2 = Jans | last3 = Sanchez | first3 = Juan G. | last4 = Maia | first4 = Mauricio | last5 = Berrocal | first5 = Maria H. | last6 = Wu | first6 = Lihteh | last7 = Saravia | first7 = Mario J. | last8 = Costa | first8 = Rogerio A. |display-authors=etal}}</ref> Many retina specialists have noted impressive results in the setting of CNV, proliferative [[diabetic retinopathy]], [[neovascular glaucoma]], diabetic [[macular edema]], [[retinopathy of prematurity]]<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.4103/0301-4738.33057 |title=Intravitreal bevacizumab in aggressive posterior retinopathy of prematurity |year=2007 |last1=Azad |first1=Rajvardhan |last2=Chandra |first2=Parijat |journal=Indian Journal of Ophthalmology |volume=55 |issue=4 |page=319 |pmid=17595491}}</ref> and macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusions.

===Administration===
Bevacizumab is usually given intravenously every 14 days. In colon cancer, it is given in combination with the chemotherapy drug 5-FU ([[5-fluorouracil]]), [[leucovorin]], and [[oxaliplatin]] or [[irinotecan]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} For treatment of eye diseases it is injected intravitreously.

==Adverse effects==
Bevacizumab inhibits the growth of blood vessels, which is part of the body's normal healing and maintenance. The body grows new blood vessels in [[wound healing]], and as [[collateral circulation]] around blocked or [[atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic]] blood vessels. One concern is that bevacizumab will interfere with these normal processes, and worsen conditions like [[coronary artery disease]] or [[peripheral artery disease]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Semenza GL |title=A new weapon for attacking tumor blood vessels |journal=N.

==Chemistry==

Bevacizumab was originally derived from a mouse monoclonal antibody generated from mice immunized with the 165-residue- form of recombinant human vascular endothelial growth factor.  It was humanized by retaining the [[complementarity determining region|binding region]] and replacing the rest with a human full [[Immunoglobulin light chain|light chain]] and a human truncated  IgG1 [[Immunoglobulin heavy chain|heavy chain]], with some other substitutions.  The resulting plasmid was transfected into [[Chinese Hamster Ovary cell]]s which are grown in [[industrial fermentation]] systems.<ref name=":0">European Medicines Agency. 2005 [http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Scientific_Discussion/human/000582/WC500029262.pdf Bevacizumab Scientific DIscussion]</ref>{{rp|4}}

It received its first approval in the United States in 2004, for combination use with standard [[chemotherapy]] for metastatic [[colon cancer]].<ref name=PrescribingInformation>{{cite web |title=Avastin full Prescribing Information - Genentech |url=http://www.gene.com/gene/products/information/pdf/avastin-prescribing.pdf |agency=Gene.com |date=2011 |format=PDF}}</ref> It has since been approved for use in certain lung cancers, renal cancers, ovarian cancers, and [[glioblastoma multiforme]] of the brain.

==Society and culture==

===Costs===
In countries with national health care systems (such as the UK and Canada), many of those national health services have restricted bevacizumab on the basis of cost-benefit calculations; in the U.K., for example, the [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] has taken the position that bevacizumab should not be funded by the NHS because it costs nearly £21,000 per patient but only minimal benefit in many cancers.<ref name="BBCReport">{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11060968 |title=Critics condemn bowel cancer drug rejection| author=Briggs, Helen (BBC News Health Reporter)| accessdate=2010-08-24|date=August 24, 2010}}</ref> In 2006, the Scottish Medicines Consortium recommended against the NHS funding Avastin for first-line treatment of metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum, due to estimated costs of £24,000 to £93,000 per [[quality-adjusted life year]] (QALY).<ref>{{cite web|title=Bevacizumab|url=http://www.scottishmedicines.org.uk/files/bevacizumab__Avastin__Resubmissionn_May_06_FINAL_for_website.pdf|publisher=Scottish Medicines|accessdate=18 July 2012}}</ref>

The addition of bevacizumab to standard treatment can prolong the lives of breast and lung cancer patients by several months, at a cost of $100,000 a year in the United States.<ref>{{cite news |author=Berenson, Alex |title=A Cancer Drug Shows Promise, at a Price That Many Can't Pay |newspaper=New York Times |date=February 15, 2006 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/15/business/15drug.html}}</ref> For [[colorectal cancer]], Robert J.

===Use for macular degeneration===
When bevacizumab is used in the treatment of [[wet age-related macular degeneration]] (wet AMD), only tiny and relatively inexpensive doses (compared to amounts used in colon and other cancers)  are required.  Some investigators believe that bevacizumab at a cost of around $42 a dose is as effective as [[ranibizumab]] at a cost of over $1,593 a dose.<ref>{{cite news |title=Medicare Eye Study Finds Untapped Savings |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=June 17, 2010 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB20001424052748703513604575311070894017154 |first=Alicia |last=Mundy}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.c2459 |title=Bevacizumab for neovascular age related macular degeneration (ABC Trial): multicentre randomised double masked study |year=2010 |last1=Tufail |first1=A. |last2=Patel |first2=P.

As of April 2015, there was a fierce debate in the UK and other European countries concerning the choice of prescribing bevacizumab or [[ranibizumab]] (Lucentis) for wet AMD.<ref name=BMJ2015pt1>{{cite news|title=Why have UK doctors been deterred from prescribing Avastin?|URL=http://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h1654|accessdate=2 April 2015|publisher=The British Medical Journal|date=1 April 2015}}</ref>  In the UK, part of the tension was between on the one hand, both the [[European Medicines Agency]] and the [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] which had approved Lucentis but not Avastin for wet AMD, and their interest in ensuring that doctors to do not use medicines off-label when there are other, approved medications for the same indication, and on the other hand, [[NICE]] in the UK, which sets treatment guidelines, and has been unable so far to appraise Avastin as a first-line treatment, in order to save money for the [[National Health Service]].<ref name=BMJ2015pt1/>  Novartis and Roche (which respectively have marketing rights and ownership rights for Avastin) had not conducted clinical trials to get approval for Avastin for wet AMD and had no intention of doing so.<ref name=BMJ2015pt1/>  Further, both companies lobbied against treatment guidelines that would make Avastin a first-line treatment, and when government-funded studies comparing the two drugs were published, they published papers emphasizing the risks of using Avastin for wet AMD.<ref name=BMJ2015pt1/>

=== Breast cancer approval ===
In 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration removed bevacizumab indication for metastatic breast cancer after concluding that the drug has not been shown to be safe and effective. The specific indication that was withdrawn was for the use of bevacizumab in metastatic breast cancer, with paclitaxel for the treatment of people who have not received chemotherapy for metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer.

In 2010, before the FDA announcement, The [[National Comprehensive Cancer Network]] (NCCN) updated the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines for Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for Breast Cancer to affirm the recommendation regarding the use of bevacizumab in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In 2008, the FDA approved bevacizumab for use in [[breast cancer]]. A panel of outside advisers voted 5 to 4 against approval, but their recommendations were overruled. The panel expressed concern that data from the clinical trial did not show any increase in quality of life or prolonging of life for patients — two important benchmarks for late-stage [[cancer]] treatments. The [[clinical trial]] did show that bevacizumab reduced tumor volumes and showed an increase in [[Progression Free Survival|progression free survival time]].  It was based on this data that the FDA chose to overrule the recommendation of the panel of advisers. This decision was lauded by patient advocacy groups and some oncologists. Other oncologists felt that granting approval for late-stage cancer therapies that did not prolong or increase the quality of life for patients would give license to [[pharmaceutical companies]] to ignore these important benchmarks when developing new late-stage cancer therapies.<ref name=nytimesref />

On March 28, 2007, the European Commission approved bevacizumab in combination with [[paclitaxel]] for the first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer.<ref name="Austria-Codex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Jasek, W|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2007|edition=2007/2008|isbn=978-3-85200-181-4|language=German}}{{Page needed|date=July 2011}}</ref>

===Counterfeit===
On Tuesday, February 14, 2012, Roche and its U.S. biotech unit Genentech announced that counterfeit Avastin had been distributed in the United States.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/15/us-counterfeits-cancer-drug-avastin-foun-idUSTRE81E1TK20120215 | work=Reuters | title=Counterfeits of cancer drug Avastin found in U.S | date=February 15, 2012}}</ref>  The investigation is ongoing, but differences in the outer packaging make identification of the bogus drugs simple for medical providers.  Roche analyzed three bogus vials of Avastin and found they contained [[salt]], [[starch]], [[citrate]], [[isopropanol]], [[propanediol]], [[t-butanol]], [[benzoic acid]], di-fluorinated benzene ring, [[acetone]] and [[phthalate]] moiety, but no active ingredients of the cancer drug.   According to Roche, the levels of the chemicals were not consistent; whether the chemicals were at harmful concentrations could not therefore be determined.  The counterfeit Avastin has been traced back to Egypt, and it entered legitimate supply chains via Europe to the United States.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/02/27/us-avastin-idUKTRE81Q29X20120227|title=Fake Avastin had salt, starch, chemicals:Roche|author=Berkrot, Bill|publisher=Reuters|date=February 27, 2012|accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/phony-avastin-vials-contained-chemicals-no-drugs/2012-02-28|title=Phony Avastin vials contained chemicals, but no drugs|author=Staton, Tracy|publisher=FiercePharma.com|date=February 28, 2012|accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref>

In July 2014, two [[Pharming (genetics)|pharming]] companies, PlantForm and PharmaPraxis, announced plans to commercialize a [[biosimilar]] version of bevacizumab made using a [[tobacco]] expression system in collaboration with the [[Fraunhofer Society#Fraunhofer USA|Fraunhofer Center for Molecular Biology]].<ref>Brennan, Zachary.

===Specialty drugs===
On September 16, 2014 Genentech reclassified bevacizumab as [[specialty drugs]] which are only available through specialty pharmacies. "Specialty drugs usually fall under the FDA’s Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program, established for compounds like the testosterone... that may have unusual side effects; or for drugs that are unusually expensive."<ref name="Time_2014" /> This has caused concern to hospitals as the price increased.<ref name="Time_2014">{{cite web | url=http://time.com/3541484/cancer-drug-price-hikes/ | title=Hospitals Furious at Cancer-Drug Price Hikes | work=Time | date=27 October 2014 | accessdate=26 October 2015 | author=Saporito, Bill}}</ref>  According to [[IMS Health]], the average price charged by hospitals for bevacizumab is approximately $9000 compared to approximately $2300 when administered in a doctor's office.
