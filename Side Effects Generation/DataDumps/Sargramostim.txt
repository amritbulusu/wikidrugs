'''Sargramostim''' (marketed by [[Genzyme]] under the tradename '''Leukine''') is a [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] [[granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor]] (GM-CSF) that functions as an [[immunostimulator]].<ref name="pmid17512160">{{cite journal |author=Kirman I |title=Perioperative sargramostim (recombinant human GM-CSF) induces an increase in the level of soluble VEGFR1 in colon cancer patients undergoing minimally invasive surgery |journal= European Journal of Surgical Oncology |volume= 33|issue= 10|pages= 1169–1176|year=2007 |pmid=17512160 |doi=10.1016/j.ejso.2007.03.014 |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Belizon A |author3=Balik E |display-authors=3 |last4=Feingold |first4=D |last5=Arnell |first5=T |last6=Horst |first6=P |last7=Kumara |first7=S |last8=Cekic |first8=V |last9=Jain |first9=S}}</ref>

==Therapeutic uses==
Sargramostim is primarily used for myeloid reconstitution after autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. It is also used to treat [[neutropenia]] induced by chemotherapy during the treatment of [[acute myeloid leukemia]].  Sargramostim has recently shown promise in treating Crohn's disease and other GI inflammatory disorders.  This medication is being investigated in trials to treat autoimmune [[pulmonary alveolar proteinosis]] (PAP).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00901511 |title=Whole Lung Lavage (WLL)/Inhaled Granulocyte-macrophage Colony-stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) in Autoimmune Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis (PAP). Phase II/III trial 2009-2013 |publisher=Clinicaltrials.gov |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref>  It is also being investigated in combination with oncolytic reovirus in brain cancer.

==Contraindications==
Sargramostim should not be used in patients with excessive leukemic myeloid blasts in the bone marrow or peripheral blood (≥ 10%), in patients with known hypersensitivity to GM-CSF, yeast-derived products or any component of the product and for concomitant use with chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

==History==
The sequence of human [[GM-CSF]] was first identified in 1985 and soon three recominbant human GM-CSFs were produced, one in bacteria, one in mammalian cells, and one in yeast;<ref name=Blood1998rev>{{cite journal|last1=Armitage|first1=JO|title=Emerging applications of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.|journal=Blood|date=15 December 1998|volume=92|issue=12|pages=4491-508|pmid=9845514|url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/92/12/4491?sso-checked=true}}</ref> [[Immunex]] developed GM-CSF manufactured in yeast into Leukine.<ref name=back/>  Clinical trials of sargramostim were initiated in 1987;<ref name=Immunexhist/> in that same year it was administered to six people as part of a compassionate-use protocol for the victims of cesium irradiation from the [[Goiânia accident]].<ref>{{cite web|author = Schmeck HM | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/02/world/radiation-team-sent-to-brazil-saves-two-with-a-new-drug.html | title = Radiation Team Sent to Brazil Saves Two With a New Drug | publisher = New York Times | date = 1987-11-02 | accessdate = 2012-06-20 }}</ref>

===Liquid formulation - withdrawn===
On January 23, 2008, Bayer informed healthcare professionals of the market withdrawal of the current liquid formulation of sargramostim. The liquid formulation was withdrawn because of an upward trend in spontaneous reports of adverse reactions, including [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]] (fainting), which are temporally correlated with a change that was made to the formulation around April 2007 to include edetate disodium ([[EDTA]]).<ref name=back>{{cite journal|last1=Staff|title=Back to the Future: Original Liquid Leukine® Coming Soon|journal=Oncology Business Review|date=May 2008|url=https://obroncology.com/documents/OBR_may08_LEUKINE.pdf}}</ref>   The upward trend in adverse reaction reporting rates had not been observed with the use of [[Freeze-drying|lyophilized]] sargramostim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/safety/medwatch/safetyinformation/safetyalertsforhumanmedicalproducts/ucm128145.pdf|title=MedWatch Safety Alerts for Human Medical Products |publisher=Fda.gov |date=2008-11-06 |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref>  The original liquid formulation without EDTA was returned to the market in the US in May 2008.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Chi|first1=Judy|title=Bayer launches Leukine without EDTA|url=http://drugtopics.modernmedicine.com/drug-topics/news/clinical/community-pharmacy/bayer-launches-leukine-without-edta|publisher=Drug Topics|date=May 21, 2008}}</ref>
