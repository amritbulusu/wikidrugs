'''Amobarbital''' (formerly known as '''amylobarbitone''' or '''sodium amytal''') is a drug that is a [[barbiturate]] derivative. It has [[sedative]]-[[hypnotic]] properties. It is a white crystalline powder with no odor and a slightly bitter taste. It was first synthesized in [[Germany]] in 1923. If amobarbital is taken for extended periods of time, physical and [[Substance dependence|psychological dependence]] can develop. Amobarbital withdrawal mimics [[delirium tremens]] and may be life-threatening.

==Pharmacology==
In an ''[[in vitro]]'' study in rat thalamic slices amobarbital worked by activating [[GABA A receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor]]s, which decreased input resistance, depressed [[action potential|burst and tonic firing]], especially in [[Thalamus|ventrobasal and intralaminar]] [[neuron]]s, while at the same time increasing burst duration and mean [[Electrical conductance|conductance]] at individual [[chloride channel]]s; this increased both the amplitude and decay time of [[Wiktionary:inhibit|inhibitory]] [[postsynaptic]] [[current (electricity)|current]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal

===Unapproved/off-label===
When given slowly by an intravenous route, sodium amobarbital has a reputation for acting as a so-called [[truth serum]]. Under the influence, a person will divulge information that under normal circumstances they would block. As such, the drug was first employed clinically by Dr. [[William Bleckwenn]] at the University of Wisconsin to circumvent inhibitions in psychiatric patients.<ref>{{ cite journal | last1 = Bleckwenn | first1 = W.

It was used by the [[United States armed forces]] during [[World War II]] in an attempt to treat [[shell shock]] and return soldiers to the [[Front (military)|front-line]] duties.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/bulge/filmmore/pt.html |work=Battle of the Bulge - program transcript |title=Use of sodium amytal during WWII |quote=Ben Kimmelman, Captain, 28th Infantry: The assumptions were that this would have some kind of cathartic effect, the sodium amytal, which the men called ''blue 88's.'' You know, the most effective artillery piece of the Germans was the 88 and this was ''blue 88s'', because the sodium amytal was a blue tablet. |publisher=PBS}}</ref> This use has since been discontinued as the powerful sedation, cognitive impairment, and dis-coordination induced by the drug greatly reduced soldiers' usefulness in the field.

==Interactions==
Amobarbital has been known to decrease the effects of hormonal birth control, sometimes to the point of uselessness.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Being chemically related to [[phenobarbital]], it might also do the same thing to [[digitoxin]], a [[cardiac glycoside]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Overdose==
Some side effects of overdose include confusion (severe); decrease in or loss of reflexes; drowsiness (severe); fever; irritability (continuing); low body temperature; poor judgment; shortness of breath or slow or troubled breathing; slow heartbeat; slurred speech; staggering; trouble in sleeping; unusual movements of the eyes; weakness (severe).

==Chemistry==
[[File:Amobarbital synthesis.png|800px]]

Amobarbital (5-ethyl-5-isoamylbarbituric acid), like all barbiturates, is synthesized by reacting [[malonic acid]] derivatives with [[urea]] derivatives. In particular, in order to make amobarbital, α-ethyl-α-isoamylmalonic ester is reacted with urea (in the presence of [[sodium ethoxide]]).<ref>{{ cite patent

==Society and culture==
It has been used to convict alleged murderers such as [[Andres English-Howard]], who strangled his girlfriend to death but claimed innocence. He was surreptitiously administered the drug by his lawyer, and under the influence of it he revealed why he strangled her and under what circumstances. A year later he confessed on the witness stand and was convicted on the basis of these statements. He later committed suicide in his cell.<ref name=CBS>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/04/07/60II/main548221.shtml |title=Truth Serum: A Possible Weapon |publisher=[[CBS News]] |work=[[60 Minutes]] |date=February 11, 2009 |author=Rebecca Leung}}</ref>

On the night of August 28, 1951, [[Robert Walker (actor, born 1918)|Robert Walker]]'s housekeeper found the actor in an emotional state. She called Walker's psychiatrist who arrived and administered amobarbital for sedation. Walker was allegedly drinking prior to his emotional outburst, and it is believed the combination of amobarbital and alcohol resulted in a severe reaction. As a result, he passed out and stopped breathing, and all efforts to resuscitate him failed. Walker died at 32 years old.

Street names for Amobarbital include "blues", "blue angels", "blue birds", and "blue devils".{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
