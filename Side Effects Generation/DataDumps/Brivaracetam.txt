'''Brivaracetam''' (trade name '''Briviact'''), a chemical analog of [[levetiracetam]], is a [[racetam]] derivative with [[anticonvulsant]] (antiepileptic) properties.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = von Rosenstiel P | title = Brivaracetam (UCB 34714) | journal = Neurotherapeutics | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 84–7 | date = Jan 2007 | pmid = 17199019 | doi = 10.1016/j.nurt.2006.11.004 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Malawska B, Kulig K | title = Brivaracetam UCB | journal = Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs | volume = 6 | issue = 7 | pages = 740–746 | date = Jul 2005 | pmid = 16044671 }}</ref> It is marketed by the pharmaceutical company [[UCB (company)|UCB]].

==Medical uses==
Brivaracetam is used to treat partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation, in combination with other antiepileptic drugs. No data are available for its effectiveness and safety in patients younger than 16 years.<ref name="Drugs.com">[[Drugs.com]]: {{Drugs.com|parent|briviact}} for Briviact.</ref><ref name="EMA" />

==Adverse effects==
The most common adverse effects include sleepiness, [[dizziness]], [[nausea]] and vomiting. More rarely, coordination problems and changes in behaviour can occur.<ref name="Drugs.com" /><ref name="EMA" />

==Interactions==
Coadministration of brivaracetam with [[carbamazepine]] may increase exposure to carbamazepine-epoxide, the [[active metabolite]] of carbamazepine, and could theoretically lead to reduced tolerability. Coadministration of brivaracetam with [[phenytoin]] may increase phenytoin levels. Coadministration of other antiseizure drugs are unlikely to affect brivaracetam exposure. Brivaracetam provides no added therapeutic benefit when administered in conjunction with levetiracetam that acts on the same protein.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors= Rolan P, Sargentini-Maier ML, Pigeolet E, Stockis A |date= 2008|title= The pharmacokinetics, CNS pharmacodynamics and adverse event profile of brivaracetam after multiple increasing oral doses in healthy men |journal= Br J Clin Pharmacol.|volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=71–5 |pmc= 2485265|pmid=18341673 |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2125.2008.03158.x}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
Brivaracetam is believed to act by binding to the ubiquitous [[synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A]] (SV2A), like levetiracetam. but with 20-fold greater affinity.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rogawski MA, Bazil CW | title = New molecular targets for antiepileptic drugs: alpha(2)delta, SV2A, and K(v)7/KCNQ/M potassium channels | journal = Current Neurology and Neuroscience Reports | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 345–352 | date = Jul 2008 | pmid = 18590620 | pmc = 2587091 | doi = 10.1007/s11910-008-0053-7 }}</ref><ref name="AC">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2015|language=German}}</ref> There is some evidence that racetams including levetiracetam and brivaracetam access the luminal side of recycling synaptic vesicles during vesicular endocytosis. They may reduce excitatory neurotransmitter release and enhance synaptic depression during trains of high-frequency activity, such as is believed to occur during epileptic activity.
<ref>{{cite journal | author = Rogawski MA | date=2016 | title=A new SV2A ligand for epilepsy | journal=Cell | volume=167| pages=587|doi= 10.1016/j.cell.2016.09.057 | pmid=27768878}}</ref>

===Pharmacokinetics===
Brivaracetam exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over a wide dose range, is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration, has an elimination half-life of 7 to 8 hours, and has [[plasma protein binding]] of less than 20%. It is extensively [[metabolize]]d (>90%), primarily via hydrolysis of the [[acetamide]] group, and secondarily through hydroxylation mediated by the liver enzyme [[CYP2C19]]. The three major metabolites (hydroxy, acid, and hydroxyacid) are pharmacologically inactive. Brivaracetam is eliminated as [[urine|urinary]] metabolites, with over 95% of a radioactive test dose recovered in the urine within 72 hours, including only 8.6% as unchanged brivaracetam.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors= Sargentini-Maier ML, Espié P, Coquette A, Stockis A |date= 2008 |title= Pharmacokinetics and metabolism of 14C-brivaracetam, a novel SV2A ligand, in healthy subjects|journal= Drug Metab Dispos. |volume= 36|issue=1 |pages=36–45 |pmid= 17908923|doi= 10.1124/dmd.107.017129 }}</ref>

==Chemical and physical properties==
[[File:Levetiracetam.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|Levetiracetam, for comparison]]
Brivaracetam is the 4''R''-propyl [[chemical analogue|analogue]] of the anticonvulsant levetiracetam.
