'''Radafaxine''' is [[drug]] candidate designated '''GW-353,162'''<ref>[http://www.bioportfolio.com/reports/DMD_Restless%20Legs%20Syndrome%20First%20Approval.htm Restless Legs Syndrome: First Approval<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  by [[GlaxoSmithKline]], investigated for treatment of [[restless leg syndrome]] and as an NDRI antidepressant.  GlaxoSmithKline was targeting Radafaxine for regulatory filing in 2007,<ref>[http://www.biospace.com/news_story.aspx?StoryID=18222420&full=1 {1} Reviews Novel Therapeutics For CNS Disorders And Confirms Strong Pipeline Momentum - News, Search Jobs, Events<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> but development was discontinued in 2006 due to "poor test results".<ref>Independent.co.uk: [http://news.independent.co.uk/business/news/article1199374.ece#10919204097707524565 GSK breakthrough on bird flu vaccine].</ref>

==Chemistry==
It is a potent [[Metabolite#Metabolites|metabolite]] of [[Bupropion#Pharmacokinetics|bupropion]], the compound in GlaxoSmithKline's [[Wellbutrin]]. More specifically, "[[hydroxybupropion]]" is an analogue of bupropion, and radafaxine is an isolated isomer ((2S,3S)-) of hydroxybupropion.<ref>{{MeshName|radafaxine}}</ref>

Therefore, radafaxine builds on at least some of the properties of bupropion in humans.<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=105&STORY=/www/story/11-23-2004/0002499330 GlaxoSmithKline Reviews Novel Therapeutics for CNS Disorders and Confirms Strong Pipeline Momentum<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Effects==
In various [[clinical trials]], radafaxine has been studied as a treatment for [[clinical depression]], [[obesity]], and [[neuropathy|neuropathic pain]].  Radafaxine is described as a [[norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor]] (NDRI).

Unlike [[bupropion]] (which has a much higher effect on [[dopamine]] [[reuptake]]), radafaxine seems to have a higher potency on [[norepinephrine]]. Radafaxine has about 70% of bupropion's efficacy in blocking dopamine reuptake, and 392% of efficacy in blocking norepinephrine reuptake, making it fairly selective for inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine over dopamine.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Xu | first1 = H | last2 = Loboz | first2 = KK | last3 = Gross | first3 = AS | last4 = McLachlan | first4 = AJ |name-list-format=vanc| year = 2007 | title = Stereoselective analysis of hydroxybupropion and application to drug interaction studies | url = | journal = Chirality | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 163–70 | doi = 10.1002/chir.20356 | pmid = 17167747 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bondarev | first1 = ML | last2 = Bondareva | first2 = TS | last3 = Young | first3 = R | last4 = Glennon | first4 = RA |name-list-format=vanc| year = 2003 | title = Behavioral and biochemical investigations of bupropion metabolites | url = | journal = Eur J Pharmacol | volume = 474 | issue = 1| pages = 85–93 | doi = 10.1016/S0014-2999(03)02010-7 | pmid = 12909199 }}</ref> This, according to GlaxoSmithKline, may account for the increased effect of radafaxine on [[pain]] and [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]].<ref>[http://213.219.8.102/pdfs/gsk/cns_seminar/353162.pdf Microsoft PowerPoint - slides_05_burch.ppt<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

At least one study suggests that radafaxine has a low [[Drug abuse|abuse]] potential similar to bupropion.<ref>[http://www.biopsychiatry.com/radafaxine.htm Radafaxine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
