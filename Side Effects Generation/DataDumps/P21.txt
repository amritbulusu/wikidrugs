== Function ==

=== CDK inhibition ===

p21 is a potent [[cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor]] (CKI). The p21 (CIP1/WAF1) protein binds to and inhibits the activity of [[cyclin]]-[[Cyclin-dependent kinase 2|CDK2]], -[[Cyclin-dependent kinase 1|CDK1]], and -[[cyclin-dependent kinase 4|CDK4]][[cyclin-dependent kinase 6|/6]] complexes, and thus functions as a regulator of [[cell cycle]] progression at [[Cell cycle checkpoint#G1 .28Restriction.29 Checkpoint|G<sub>1</sub>]] and [[S phase]].<ref name="pmid15899785">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gartel AL, Radhakrishnan SK | title = Lost in transcription: p21 repression, mechanisms, and consequences | journal = Cancer Res. | volume = 65 | issue = 10 | pages = 3980–5  | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15899785 | doi = 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3995 }}</ref><ref name="Deng Zhang Harper Elledge 1995 pp. 675–684">{{cite journal | last=Deng | first=Chuxia | last2=Zhang | first2=Pumin | last3=Harper | first3=J.

Experiments looking at CDK2 activity within single cells have also shown p21 to be responsible for a bifurcation in CDK2 activity following mitosis, cells with high p21 enter a [[G0 phase|G<sub>0</sub>/quiescent]] state, whilst those with low p21 continue to proliferate.<ref name="Spencer Cappell Tsai Overton 2013 pp. 369–383">{{cite journal | last=Spencer | first=Sabrina~L. | last2=Cappell | first2=Steven~D. | last3=Tsai | first3=Feng-Chiao | last4=Overton | first4=K.~Wesley | last5=Wang | first5=Clifford~L. | last6=Meyer | first6=Tobias | title=The Proliferation-Quiescence Decision Is Controlled by a Bifurcation in CDK2 Activity at Mitotic Exit | journal=Cell | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=155 | issue=2 | year=2013 | pages=369–383 | url=https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.cell.2013.08.062 | doi=10.1016/j.cell.2013.08.062 | accessdate=2017-03-20}}</ref> Follow up work, found evidence that this bistability is underpinned by double negative feedback between p21 and CDK2, were CDK2 inhibits p21 activity via [[ubiquitin ligase]] activity.<ref name="Overton Spencer Noderer Meyer 2014 pp. E4386–E4393">{{cite journal | last=Overton | first=K.

=== PCNA inhibition ===

p21 interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen ([[PCNA]]), a DNA polymerase accessory factor, and plays a regulatory role in S phase DNA replication and DNA damage repair.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Flores-Rozas H ''et al'' | year = 1994 | title = Cdk-interacting protein 1 directly binds with proliferating cell nuclear antigen and inhibits DNA replication catalyzed by the DNA polymerase delta holoenzyme | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 91 | issue = 18| pages = 8655–8659 | doi=10.1073/pnas.91.18.8655}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Waga S ''et al'' | year = 1994 | title = The p21 inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases controls DNA replication by interaction with PCNA | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 369 | issue = 6481| page = 574 | doi=10.1038/369574a0}}</ref><ref name="pmid1358458">{{cite journal | vauthors = Xiong Y, Zhang H, Beach D | year = 1992 | title = D type cyclins associate with multiple protein kinases and the DNA replication and repair factor PCNA | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 71 | issue = 3| pages = 505–14 | pmid = 1358458 | doi=10.1016/0092-8674(92)90518-h}}</ref> Specifically, p21 has a high affinity for the PIP-box binding region on PCNA,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Warbrick E, Lane DP, Glover DM, Cox LS | year = 1997 | title = Homologous regions of Fen1 and p21Cip1 compete for binding to the same site on PCNA: a potential mechanism to co-ordinate DNA replication and repair | url = | journal = Oncogene | volume = 14 | issue = 19| pages = 2313–2321 | doi=10.1038/sj.onc.1201072 | pmid=9178907}}</ref> binding of p21 to this region is proposed to block the binding of processivity factors necessary for PCNA dependent S-phase DNA synthesis, but not PCNA dependent [[nucleotide excision repair]]  (NER).<ref name="Gulbis Kelman Hurwitz ODonnell 1996 pp. 297–306">{{cite journal | last=Gulbis | first=Jacqueline M | last2=Kelman | first2=Zvi | last3=Hurwitz | first3=Jerard | last4=O'Donnell | first4=Mike | last5=Kuriyan | first5=John | title=Structure of the C-Terminal Region of p21WAF1/CIP1 Complexed with Human PCNA | journal=Cell | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=87 | issue=2 | year=1996 | pages=297–306 | url=https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fs0092-8674%2800%2981347-1 | doi=10.1016/s0092-8674(00)81347-1 | accessdate=2017-03-20 | pmid=8861913}}</ref> As such, p21 acts as an effective inhibitor of DNA S-phase DNA synthesis though permits NER, leading to the proposal that p21 acts to preferentially select polymerase processivity factors depending on the context of DNA synthesis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Podust VN, Podust LM, Goubin F, Ducommun B, Huebscher U | year = 1995 | title = Mechanism of inhibition of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-dependent DNA synthesis by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 | url = | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 34 | issue = 27| pages = 8869–8875 | doi=10.1021/bi00027a039}}</ref>

=== Apoptosis inhibition ===

This protein was reported to be specifically cleaved by [[CASP3]]-like [[caspase]]s, which thus leads to a dramatic activation of CDK2, and may be instrumental in the execution of [[apoptosis]] following [[caspase]] activation. However p21 may inhibit apoptosis and does not induce cell death on its own.<ref name="pmid11960320">{{cite journal | vauthors = Almond JB, Cohen GM | title = The proteasome: a novel target for cancer chemotherapy | journal = Leukemia | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 433–43  | date = April 2002 | pmid = 11960320 | doi = 10.1038/sj.leu.2402417 }}</ref> The ability of p21 to inihbit apoptosis in response to replication fork stress has also been reported.<ref name="pmid16280359">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rodriguez R, Meuth M | title = Chk1 and p21 cooperate to prevent apoptosis during DNA replication fork stress | journal = Mol.

== Regulation ==

=== p53 dependent response ===

Studies of p53 dependent cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage identified p21 as the primary mediator of downstream cell cycle arrest. Notably, El-Diery ''et al.'' identified a protein p21 which was present in cells expressing wild type p53 but not those with mutant p53, moreover constituitive expression of p21 led to cell cycle arrest in a number of cell types.<ref name="El-Deiry 1993 pp. 817–825">{{cite journal | last=El-Deiry | first=W | title=WAF1, a potential mediator of p53 tumor suppression | journal=Cell | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=75 | issue=4 | year=1993 | pages=817–825 | url=https://doi.org/10.1016%2F0092-8674%2893%2990500-p | doi=10.1016/0092-8674(93)90500-p | accessdate=2017-03-20 | pmid=8242752}}</ref> Dulcic ''et al.'' also found that γ-irradiation of fibroblasts induced a p53 and p21 dependent cell cycle arrest, here p21 was found bound to inactive [[cyclin E]]/[[CDK2]] complexes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dulić V ''et al'' | year = 1994 | title = p53-dependent inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase activities in human fibroblasts during radiation-induced G1 arrest | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 76 | issue = 6| pages = 1013–1023 | doi=10.1016/0092-8674(94)90379-4}}</ref> Working in mouse models, it was also shown that whilst mice lacking p21 were healthy, spontaneous tumours developed and G1 checkpoint control was compromised in cells derived from these mice.<ref name="Brugarolas Chandrasekaran Gordon Beach 1995 pp. 552–557">{{cite journal | last=Brugarolas | first=James | last2=Chandrasekaran | first2=Chitra | last3=Gordon | first3=Jeffrey I. | last4=Beach | first4=David | last5=Jacks | first5=Tyler | last6=Hannon | first6=Gregory J. | title=Radiation-induced cell cycle arrest compromised by p21 deficiency | journal=Nature | publisher=Springer Nature | volume=377 | issue=6549 | year=1995 | pages=552–557 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038%2F377552a0 | doi=10.1038/377552a0 | accessdate=2017-03-20}}</ref><ref name="Deng Zhang Harper Elledge 1995 pp. 675–684" /> Taken together, these studies thus defined p21 as the primary mediator of p53-dependent cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage.

Recent work exploring p21 activation in response to DNA damage at a single-cell level have demonstrated that pulsatile p53 activity leads to subsequent pulses of p21, and that the strength of p21 activation is cell cycle phase dependent.<ref name="Stewart-Ornstein Lahav 2016 pp. 1800–1811">{{cite journal | last=Stewart-Ornstein | first=Jacob | last2=Lahav | first2=Galit | title=Dynamics of CDKN1A in Single Cells Defined by an Endogenous Fluorescent Tagging Toolkit | journal=Cell Reports | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=14 | issue=7 | year=2016 | pages=1800–1811 | url=https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.celrep.2016.01.045 | doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2016.01.045 | accessdate=2017-03-20}}</ref> Moreover, studies of p21-levels in populations of cycling cells, not exposed to DNA damaging agents, have shown that DNA damage occurring in mother cell S-phase can induce p21 accumulation over both mother G2 and daughter G1 phases which subsequently induces cell cycle arrest;<ref name="Barr Cooper Heldt Butera 2017 p=14728">{{cite journal | last=Barr | first=Alexis R. | last2=Cooper | first2=Samuel | last3=Heldt | first3=Frank S. | last4=Butera | first4=Francesca | last5=Stoy | first5=Henriette | last6=Mansfeld | first6=Jörg | last7= Novák | first7=Béla | last8=Bakal | first8=Chris | title=DNA damage during S-phase mediates the proliferation-quiescence decision in the subsequent G1 via p21 expression | journal=Nature Communications | publisher=Springer Nature | volume=8 | year=2017 | page=14728 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038%2Fncomms14728 | doi=10.1038/ncomms14728 | accessdate=2017-03-20}}</ref> this responsible for the bifurcation in CDK2 activity observed in Spencer ''et al.''.<ref name="Spencer Cappell Tsai Overton 2013 pp. 369–383" />

Studies of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) commonly report the nonfunctional p53-p21 axis of the G1/S checkpoint pathway, and its relevance for cell cycle regulation and the DNA damage response (DDR). p21 mRNA is clearly present and upregulated after the DDR in hESCs, but p21 protein is not detectable. In this cell type, p53 activates numerous microRNAs (like miR-302a, miR-302b, miR-302c, and miR-302d) that directly inhibit the p21 expression in hESCs.<ref name="pmid22511267">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dolezalova D, Mraz M, Barta T, Plevova K, Vinarsky V, Holubcova Z, Jaros J, Dvorak P, Pospisilova S, Hampl A | title = MicroRNAs regulate p21(Waf1/Cip1) protein expression and the DNA damage response in human embryonic stem cells | journal = Stem Cells | volume = 30 | issue = 7 | pages = 1362–72 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22511267 | doi = 10.1002/stem.1108 }}</ref>

=== Degradation ===

p21 is negatively regulated by [[ubiquitin ligases]] both over the course of the cell cycle and in response to DNA damage. Specifically, over the G1/S transition it has been demonstrated that the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex [[SCF complex|SCF]]<sup>[[SKP2|Skp2]]</sup> induces degradation of p21.<ref name="Yu Gervais Zhang 1998 pp. 11324–11329">{{cite journal | last=Yu | first=Z.-K. | last2=Gervais | first2=J.

== Clinical significance ==

Cytoplasmic p21 expression can be significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis, distant metastases, advanced [[TNM staging system|TNM]] stage (a classification of cancer staging that stands for: tumor size, describing nearby lymph nodes, and distant metastasis), depth of invasion and OS ([[overall survival rate]]). A study on immunohistochemical markers in malignant thymic epithelial tumors shows that p21 expression has a negatively influenced survival and significantly correlated with [[World Health Organization|WHO]] (World Health Organization) type B2/B3. When combined with low p27 and high p53, [[Disease-free survival|DFS]] (Disease-Free Survival) decreases.<ref name="Leisibach Schneiter Soltermann Yamada 2016 pp. 2580–2591">{{cite journal | last=Leisibach | first=Priska | last2=Schneiter | first2=Didier | last3=Soltermann | first3=Alex | last4=Yamada | first4=Yoshi | last5=Weder | first5=Walter | last6=Jungraithmayr | first6=Wolfgang | title=Prognostic value of immunohistochemical markers in malignant thymic epithelial tumors | journal=Journal of Thoracic Disease | publisher=AME Publishing Company | volume=8 | issue=9 | year=2016 | pages=2580–2591 | url=https://doi.org/10.21037%2Fjtd.2016.08.82 | doi=10.21037/jtd.2016.08.82 | accessdate=2017-03-20 | pmid=27747012 | pmc=5059354}}</ref>
