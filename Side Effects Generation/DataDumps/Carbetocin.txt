==Medical uses==
Carbetocin works as an [[oxytocic]], [[antihemorrhagic]] and [[uterotonic]] drug in the peripheral nervous system. The most common causes of [[postpartum hemorrhage]] are lack of tone in the uterus from overstretching or the use of an anesthetic.<ref name="drug">{{cite web |url=http://ferring.com/en/therapeutic/Reproductive_Health/Products/Obstetrics+Products.htm |title=Therapeutic Areas - Reproductive Health |work=Ferring Pharmaceuticals |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68CghDGla?url=http://ferring.com/en/therapeutic/Reproductive_Health/Products/Obstetrics%2BProducts.htm |archivedate=5 June 2012 |accessdate=5 June 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> Carbetocin has been approved for use immediately following an elective [[Cesarean section]] when a local or spinal [[anesthesia]] has been administered.<ref name="attilakos">{{cite journal|last=Attilakos|first=G|author2=Psaroudakis, D |author3=Ash, J |author4=Buchanan, R |author5=Winter, C |author6=Donald, F |author7=Hunt, LP |author8= Draycott, T |title=Carbetocin versus oxytocin for the prevention of postpartum haemorrhage following caesarean section: the results of a double-blind randomised trial |journal=BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology|date=July 2010|volume=117|issue=8|pages=929–36|pmid=20482535|doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.2010.02585.x}}</ref> Since the uterus cannot contract on its own following incision during a Cesarean section, exogenous administration of oxytocin or an analog is necessary to restore uterine tone and prevent hemorrhage.<ref name="attilakos"/><ref name="moertl">{{cite journal|last=Moertl|first=MG|author2=Friedrich, S |author3=Kraschl, J |author4=Wadsack, C |author5=Lang, U |author6= Schlembach, D |title=Haemodynamic effects of carbetocin and oxytocin given as intravenous bolus on women undergoing caesarean delivery: a randomised trial |journal=BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology|date=October 2011|volume=118|issue=11|pages=1349–56|pmid=21668768|doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.2011.03022.x}}</ref>

Safety of carbetocin following vaginal births and emergency Cesarean sections has not been established, though studies have suggested efficacy following vaginal births to that following Cesarean sections. Some studies have shown that a 10-70&nbsp;ug dose following vaginal delivery caused contractions and no adverse side effects.<ref name="silcox">{{cite journal |last=Silcox|first=J|author2=Schulz, P |author3=Horbay, GL |author4= Wassenaar, W |title=Transfer of carbetocin into human breast milk|journal=Obstetrics and gynecology|date=September 1993|volume=82|issue=3|pages=456–9|pmid=8355953}}</ref> Carbetocin has also been shown to increase uterine involution (the return of the uterus to its contracted state after the birth of the baby) in humans, horses and cows.<ref name="bajcsy">{{cite journal|last=Bajcsy|first=AC |author2=Szenci, O |author3=van der Weijden, GC |author4=Doornenbal, A |author5=Maassen, F |author6=Bartyik, J |author7=Taverne, MA |title=The effect of a single oxytocin or carbetocin treatment on uterine contractility in early postpartum dairy cows|journal=Theriogenology|date=20 January 2006|volume=65|issue=2|pages=400–14|pmid=15993938|doi=10.1016/j.theriogenology.2005.05.040}}</ref><ref name=schramme>{{cite journal|last=Schramme|first=AR|author2=Pinto, CR |author3=Davis, J |author4=Whisnant, CS |author5= Whitacre, MD |title=Pharmacokinetics of carbetocin, a long-acting oxytocin analogue, following intravenous administration in horses|journal=Equine veterinary journal|date=November 2008|volume=40|issue=7|pages=658–61|pmid=19165935|doi=10.2746/042516408X334343}}</ref>

Carbetocin has also been shown to stimulate milk letdown through its action on the oxytocin receptors on the myoepithelial cells and there was not a significant amount of carbetocin in breastmilk.<ref name="silcox"/>

Each dose of Duratocin contains 100 micrograms of carbetocin, 9&nbsp;mg sodium chloride and ascetic acid. pH is 3.8 and peptide content is greater than 85 percent.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Carbetocin is to be used in the hospital by prescription only. It can be administered intravenously or intramuscularly. In both cases, the recommended dose for an average adult female is 100&nbsp;ug.  Contractile effects of the uterus are apparent within two minutes and can be observed for approximately one hour,<ref name="info">{{cite web |url=http://secure.healthlinks.net.au/content/ferring/pi.cfm?product=fppdurai11007 |title=Product Information - Duratocin |work=healthlinks.net |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115071733/http://secure.healthlinks.net.au/content/ferring/pi.cfm?product=fppdurai11007 |archivedate=15 November 2011 |accessdate=5 June 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> though maximum binding occurs about 30 minutes after intramuscular injection. Administration is performed immediately following parturition to minimize risk of postpartum hemorrhage by inducing uterine contractions, increasing muscle tone and thickening the blood. If further uterine stimulation is needed, treatment with other forms of [[oxytocic]] [[uterotonic]] drugs should be used.<ref name="info"/>

Endogenous and synthetic oxytocin has a half-life of approximately 3.5 minutes.<ref name="moertl"/><ref name="engstrom">{{cite journal |last=Engstrøm |first=T |author2=Barth, T |author3=Melin, P |author4= Vilhardt, H  |title=Oxytocin receptor binding and uterotonic activity of carbetocin and its metabolites following enzymatic degradation|journal=European Journal of Pharmacology|date=21 August 1998|volume=355|issue=2–3|pages=203–10|pmid=9760035 |doi=10.1016/S0014-2999(98)00513-5}}</ref> Carbetocin, in comparison, has a much longer half-life ranging from 85–100 minutes.<ref name="moertl"/><ref name="engstrom"/> The bioavailable dose is around 80%.<ref name="silcox"/> The elimination half-life following intravenous administration is around 40 minutes, though the elimination mechanism is not entirely known.<ref name="info"/> Studies have shown that elimination is only minimally renal (0.7%), but may occur at least partially through enzymatic degradation of peptides, primarily on the C-terminal end.<ref name="engstrom"/> Both elimination and volume of distribution are not dose dependent.<ref name="info"/>

==Mechanism of action==
Carbetocin functions as an agonist at peripheral oxytocin receptors, particularly in the myometrium, with lesser affinity for myopepithelial cells. Oxytocin receptors are G protein-coupled<ref name="gimpl2001">{{cite journal |last=Gimpl |first=G|author2=Fahrenholz, F |title=The oxytocin receptor system: structure, function, and regulation |journal=Physiological reviews |date=April 2001 |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=629–83 |pmid=11274341}}</ref> and their mechanism of action involves second messengers and the production of inositol phosphates.<ref name="gimpl2005">{{cite journal |last=Gimpl |first=G |author2=Postina, R |author3=Fahrenholz, F |author4= Reinheimer, T  |title=Binding domains of the oxytocin receptor for the selective oxytocin receptor antagonist barusiban in comparison to the agonists oxytocin and carbetocin |journal=European Journal of Pharmacology|date=7 March 2005|volume=510|issue=1–2|pages=9–16|pmid=15740719 |doi=10.1016/j.ejphar.2005.01.010}}</ref> Carbetocin mimics this mechanism.<ref name="engstrom"/> Binding for carbetocin and other oxytocin agonists has been shown to be nonselective at the extracellular N-terminus and loops E2 and E3.<ref name="gimpl2005"/> While the oxytocin receptor shows equal affinity for oxytocin and carbetocin, the biological effect of carbetocin is almost 50% that of endogenous or exogenous oxytocin.<ref name="engstrom"/><ref name="gimpl2005"/> Carbetocin has a much longer lasting effect than oxytocin, necessitating only a single dose. Carbetocin inhibits endogenous oxytocin release, interrupting the uterine feedback loop with the hypothalamus and decreasing both central and peripheral release of oxytocin.<ref name="gimpl2001"/>

During pregnancy, the synthesis of oxytocin receptors in the uterus greatly increases, reaching a peak during labor and delivery. Consequently, the administration of carbetocin or another oxytocin analog during or immediately following birth will have increased uterotonic and contractile effect. The application of carbetocin does not affect a non-pregnant uterus with lower oxytocin receptor expression.<ref name="moertl"/> Carbetocin also functions to thicken the blood, further preventing post-partum hemorrhage.<ref name="drugs">{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/international/carbetocin.html |title=Carbetocin |work=drugs.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68ChBtEOd?url=http://www.drugs.com/international/carbetocin.html |archivedate=5 June 2012 |accessdate=5 June 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> Carbetocin should not be used to induce or augment labor since it could cause cardiac or respiratory distress to mother or infant.<ref name="attilakos"/><ref name="moertl"/>

==Interactions with other drugs and neurotransmitter systems==
Due to oxytocin’s close sequence [[Homology (chemistry)|homology]] with [[vasopressin]], [[oxytocin]] analogs often bind with much lower affinity to vasopressin receptors V1, in the uterine lining, and V2, in the kidneys<ref name="mims">{{cite web |url=http://www.mims.com/Malaysia/drug/info/Duratocin/Duratocin%20infusion?type=full |title=Duratocin - Detailed Prescribing Information (Membership Required) |work=MIMS Malaysia |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68ChX5CXc?url=https://member.ubmmedica.com/index.php?referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mims.com%2FMalaysia%2FSsoOtherMembership%2Findex%2F |archivedate=5 June 2012 |accessdate=5 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and may consequently interact with or disrupt the vasopressin circuitry and feedback loops.

Carbetocin may work synergistically with drugs such as [[Dinoprostone]] and [[Misoprostol]] that ripen the cervix. Concurrent use of these drugs can be risky, particularly during pregnancy and prenatal care, possibly causing premature labor or abortion.

==Adverse effects==
Ten to forty percent of patients will experience nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, itching skin, increased body temperature, trembling and weakness. One to five percent of patients may experience back and chest pain, dizziness, [[anemia]], chills and sweating, metallic taste, [[tachycardia]] and respiratory distress.<ref name="info"/><ref name="drugs"/><ref name="mims"/>

Contraindications for the use of carbetocin include inappropriate timing during labor and delivery (such as before parturition or to induce labor) or allergic reactions to carbetocin or other oxytocin homologues.<ref name="info"/> Additionally, carbetocin should not be used if a patient has high blood pressure or cardiovascular problems. Overdosage or repeated use of carbetocin, particularly if used during pregnancy, could cause hyper-excitation of the oxytocin receptors resulting in excessive and prolonged stimulation of uterine contractions, increasing risk of [[uterine rupture]], [[placental abruption]], fetal respiratory distress and [[postpartum hemorrhage]].<ref name="info"/>

==Comparison with other drugs==
Due to carbetocin's considerably longer half-life, its effects are longer lasting than other oxytocin homologs such as Pitocin or [[barusiban]].<ref name="gimpl2005"/> A single carbetocin administration compared to a placebo or an eight-hour intravenous drip of oxytocin in a randomized blind study, necessitated significantly less additional [[oxytocin]] therapy following a Cesarean section. Oxytocin receptor antagonists, such as Barusiban or [[atosiban]] have the opposite effect of depressing oxytocin receptor activity and can be used to stop premature labor and uterine contractions.<ref name="gimpl2005"/>

==Legal approval==
Carbetocin has been approved for use under the following three brand names in 23 countries, not including the United States: Duratocin (Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Italy, Malaysia, Singapore, New Zealand), Lonactene (Mexico), and Pabal (Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Estonia, France, UK, Hungary, Lithuania, Luxembourg). Duratocin has also been approved for veterinary use in Poland, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, France and the Netherlands.<ref name="drugs"/>
