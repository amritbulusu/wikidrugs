==Medical uses==

===Intravenous and intrathecal===
Intravenous fentanyl is often used for [[anaesthesia]] and [[analgesia]]. During anaesthesia it is often used along with a hypnotic agent like [[propofol]]. It is also administered in combination with a [[benzodiazepine]], such as [[midazolam]], to produce [[Procedural sedation and analgesia|sedation]] for procedures such as endoscopy, cardiac catheterization, and oral surgery, or in emergency rooms.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Godwin|first1=SA|last2=Burton|first2=JH|last3=Gerardo |first3=CJ|last4=Hatten|first4=BW|last5=Mace|first5=SE|last6=Silvers|first6=SM|last7=Fesmire|first7=FM|last8=American College of Emergency|first8=Physicians |title=Clinical policy: procedural sedation and analgesia in the emergency department.|journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine|date=February 2014|volume=63|issue=2 |pages=247–58.e18|doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2013.10.015|pmid=24438649}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=HS|last2=Colson|first2=J|last3=Sehgal|first3=N |title=An update of evaluation of intravenous sedation on diagnostic spinal injection procedures.|journal=Pain Physician|date=April 2013|volume=16|issue=2 Suppl |pages=SE217–28|pmid=23615892|url=http://www.painphysicianjournal.com/current/pdf?article=MTg4MQ%3D%3D&journal=74}}</ref> It is often used in the [[pain management|management]] of [[chronic pain]] including [[cancer pain]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Plante|first1=GE|last2=VanItallie|first2=TB|title=Opioids for cancer pain: the challenge of optimizing treatment.|journal=Metabolism: Clinical and Experimental|date=October 2010|volume=59 Suppl 1|pages=S47–52|doi=10.1016/j.metabol.2010.07.010|pmid=20837194}}</ref>

Fentanyl is sometimes given [[Intrathecal administration|intrathecally]] as part of [[spinal anaesthesia]] or epidurally for [[epidural anaesthesia]] and [[epidural analgesia|analgesia]]. Because of fentanyl's high lipid solubility, its effects are more localized than morphine, and some clinicians prefer to use morphine to get a wider spread of analgesia.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bujedo|first1=BM|title=Current evidence for spinal opioid selection in postoperative pain.|journal=The Korean journal of pain|date=July 2014|volume=27|issue=3|pages=200–9|pmid=25031805|pmc=4099232}}</ref>

===Patches===
[[File:Fentanyl Patch from Israel.jpg|thumb|right|A fentanyl patch from [[Israel]]]]
Fentanyl [[transdermal patch]]es (Durogesic/Duragesic) are used in chronic pain management. The patches work by slowly releasing fentanyl through the skin into the bloodstream over 48 to 72 hours, allowing for long-lasting pain management.<ref name="AC-Durogesic">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Jasek, W|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2007|edition=62nd|pages=2621f|isbn=978-3-85200-181-4|language=German}}</ref> Dosage is based on the size of the patch, since, in general, the transdermal absorption rate is constant at a constant skin temperature.<ref name="AC-Durogesic"/> Rate of absorption is dependent on a number of factors. Body temperature, skin type, amount of body fat, and placement of the patch can have major effects. The different delivery systems used by different makers will also affect individual rates of absorption. Under normal circumstances, the patch will reach its full effect within 12 to 24 hours; thus, fentanyl patches are often prescribed with a fast-acting opiate (such as morphine or [[oxycodone]]) to handle breakthrough pain.<ref name="AC-Durogesic" />

It is unclear if fentanyl gives long term pain relief to people with neuropathic pain.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Derry|first=Sheena|last2=Stannard|first2=Cathy|last3=Cole |first3=Peter|last4=Wiffen|first4=Philip J.|last5=Knaggs|first5=Roger|last6=Aldington|first6=Dominic|last7=Moore|first7=R. Andrew|date=2016-10-11|title=Fentanyl for neuropathic pain in adults|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=10|pages=CD011605|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011605.pub2|pmid=27727431}}</ref>

In [[palliative care]], transdermal fentanyl has a definite, but limited, role for:
*people already stabilized on other opioids who have persistent swallowing problems and cannot tolerate other parenteral routes such as subcutaneous administration.
*people with moderate to severe [[renal failure|kidney failure]].
*troublesome side effects of oral morphine, [[hydromorphone]], or oxycodone.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Care must be taken to guard against the application of external heat sources (such as direct sunlight, heating pads, etc.) which in certain circumstances can trigger the release of too much medication and cause life-threatening complications.

Duragesic was first approved by the College ter Beoordeling van Geneesmiddelen, the Medicines Evaluation Board in the Netherlands, on July 17, 1995, as 25, 50, 75 and 100&nbsp;µg/h formulations after a set of successful clinical trials, and on October 27, 2004, the 12&nbsp;µg/h (actually 12.5&nbsp;µg/h) formulation was approved as well. On January 28, 2005, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved first-time generic formulations of 25, 50, 75, and 100&nbsp;µg/h fentanyl transdermal systems (made by Mylan Technologies, Inc.; brand name Duragesic, made by Alza Corp.) through an FTC consent agreement derailing the possibility of a monopoly in the treatment of breakthrough chronic pain by Alza Corp. In some cases, physicians instruct patients to apply more than one patch at a time, giving a much wider range of possible dosages. For example, a patient may be prescribed a 37.5&nbsp;µg dosage by applying one 12.5&nbsp;µg patch and one 25&nbsp;µg patch simultaneously, or contingent on the large size of the (largest) 100&nbsp;μg/h patch, multiple patches are commonly prescribed for doses exceeding 100μg/h, such as two 75&nbsp;μg/h patches worn to afford a 150&nbsp;μg/h dosage regimen. Although the commonly referred to dosage rates are 12/25/50/75/100&nbsp;µg/h, the "12&nbsp;µg" patch actually releases 12.5&nbsp;µg/h.<ref name=prescribing>{{cite web|url=http://www.duragesic.com/duragesic/shared/pi/duragesic.pdf|title=Official Duragesic Full Prescribing Information|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828212225/http://www.duragesic.com/duragesic/shared/pi/duragesic.pdf|archivedate=2008-08-28|df=}}</ref> It is designed to release half the dose of the 25&nbsp;µg/h dose patch.

Duragesic is manufactured by [[ALZA Corporation]] and marketed by [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]] (both subsidiaries of [[Johnson & Johnson]]). During the period of June 2002 through June 2003, Duragesic sales totaled more than $1 billion.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

As of July 2009, construction of the Duragesic patch had been changed from the gel pouch and membrane design to "a drug-in-adhesive matrix designed formulation", as described in the prescribing information.<ref name=prescribing/> This construction makes illicit use of the fentanyl more difficult.

====Storage and disposal====
The fentanyl patch is one of a small number of drugs that may be especially harmful, and in some cases fatal, with just one dose, if used by someone other than the person for whom the drug was prescribed.<ref name="U.S. Food and Drug Administration"/> Unused fentanyl patches should be kept in a secure location that is out of children’s sight and reach, such as a locked cabinet.

When patches cannot be disposed of through a drug take-back program, flushing is recommended for fentanyl patches because it is the fastest and surest way to remove them from the home so they cannot harm children, pets and others who were not intended to use them.<ref name="U.S. Food and Drug Administration">{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/EnsuringSafeUseofMedicine/SafeDisposalofMedicines/ucm186187.htm |title= Disposal of Unused Medicines: What You Should Know |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |date= |access-date=2013-09-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/EnsuringSafeUseofMedicine/SafeDisposalofMedicines/ucm186187.htm#MEDICINES |title= Medicines Recommended for Disposal by Flushing |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |date= |access-date=2013-09-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DrugSafety/UCM088584.pdf |title=Medication Guide and Instructions for Use – Duragesic (fentanyl) Transdermal System |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |date= |access-date=2013-09-10}}</ref>

====Recalls====
In February 2004, a leading fentanyl supplier, Janssen Pharmaceutica Products, L.P., recalled one lot, and then later, additional lots of fentanyl (brand name: Duragesic) patches because of seal breaches which might have allowed the drug to leak from the patch. A series of Class II recalls was initiated in March 2004, and in February 2008 ALZA Corporation recalled their 25&nbsp;µg/h Duragesic patches due to a concern that small cuts in the gel reservoir could result in accidental exposure of patients or health care providers to the fentanyl gel.<ref name="recall">{{cite web |title=PRICARA RECALLS 25 mcg/hr DURAGESIC (fentanyl transdermal system) CII PAIN PATCHES |publisher=FDA |date=2008-02-12 |url=http://www.fda.gov/oc/po/firmrecalls/pricara02_08.html}}</ref>

In February 2011, the manufacturer suspended production of all Duragesic patches due to quality control issues involving unspecified "microscopic crystallization" detected during the manufacturing process of the 100&nbsp;µg/h strength.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Intranasal===
The bioavailability of intranasal fentanyl is about 70–90%, but with some imprecision due to clotted nostrils, pharyngeal swallow and incorrect administration. For both emergency and palliative use, intranasal fentanyl is available in doses of 50, 100, and 200 µg. In emergency medicine, safe administration of intranasal fentanyl with a low rate of side effects and a promising pain reducing effect was demonstrated in a prospective observational study in about 900 out-of-hospital patients.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=24268523|year=2014|author1=Karlsen|first1=A.

In children, intranasal fentanyl is useful for the treatment of moderate and severe pain and is well tolerated.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Murphy A, O'Sullivan R, Wakai A, Grant TS, Barrett MJ, Cronin J, McCoy SC, Hom J, Kandamany N |title=Intranasal fentanyl for the management of acute pain in children |journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews |volume=10 |pages=CD009942 |date=Oct 10, 2014 |pmid=25300594 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009942.pub2}}</ref>

===Lozenges===
[[File:Fentanyl lollipops Actiq 400 mcg.jpg|thumb|Package and example of fentanyl lollipop (brand: Actiq), 400 micrograms.]]
Fentanyl lozenges (''Actiq'') are a solid formulation of fentanyl citrate on a [[lollipop|stick]] in the form of a lollipop that dissolves slowly in the mouth for transmucosal absorption. These lozenges are intended for opioid-tolerant individuals and are effective in treating breakthrough cancer pain.<ref name="AC-Actiq">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Jasek, W|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2007|edition=62nd|pages=89–92|isbn=978-3-85200-181-4 |language=German}}</ref> It has also been used for breakthrough pain for patients with nonmalignant (not cancer related) pain, but this application is controversial.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Connor AB |title=Is actiq use in noncancer-related pain really "a recipe for success"? |journal=Pain Medicine |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=258–60; author reply 261–5 |year=2008 |pmid=18298711 |doi=10.1111/j.1526-4637.2008.00413.x}}</ref> The unit is a berry-flavoured lozenge on a stick swabbed on the mucosal surfaces inside the mouth—inside of the cheeks, under and on the tongue and gums—to release the fentanyl quickly into the system. It is most effective when the lozenge is consumed within 15 minutes. About 25 % of the drug is absorbed through the oral mucosa, resulting in a fast onset of action, and the rest is swallowed and absorbed in the small intestine, acting more slowly. The lozenge is less effective and acts more slowly if swallowed as a whole, as despite good absorbance from the small intestine there is extensive first-pass metabolism, leading to an oral bioavailability of about 33 % as opposed to 50 % when used correctly, (25 % via the mouth mucosa and 25 % via the gut).<ref name="AC-Actiq" />

''Actiq'' is produced by the pharmaceutical company [[Cephalon]] on a plastic stick; this provides the means by which the drug can maintain its placement while it dissolves slowly in the mouth for absorption across the [[buccal mucosa]], in a manner similar to sublingual [[buprenorphine/naloxone]] film strips. An Actiq lozenge contains two grams of sugar (eight calories).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/actiq.html|title=Actiq (fentanyl citrate) Uses, Dosage, Side Effects - Drugs.com|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/actiq.html|title=Actiq|last=Fentanyl citrate (oral transmucosal) (FEN ta nil SIT rayt)|first=|date=|website=drugs.com|access-date=}}</ref> Actiq has been linked to dental decay, with some users who had no prior dental issues suffering tooth loss, and in the U.S many users have started their own Facebook pages to educate users about the severe dental issues caused by the so-called fentanyl lollipops.

==Adverse effects==
Fentanyl's most common side effects (more than 10 % of patients) include diarrhoea, nausea, constipation, dry mouth, [[somnolence]], confusion, [[asthenia]] (weakness), sweating, and less frequently (3 to 10 % of patients) abdominal pain, headache, fatigue, anorexia and weight loss, dizziness, nervousness, hallucinations, anxiety, depression, flu-like symptoms, [[dyspepsia]] (indigestion), [[dyspnoea]] (shortness of breath), [[hypoventilation]], [[apnoea]], and urinary retention. Fentanyl use has also been associated with [[aphasia]].<ref name="urlDrugs@FDA: FDA Approved Drug Products" />

Despite being a more potent analgesic, fentanyl tends to induce less nausea, as well as less [[histamine]]-mediated itching, than morphine.<ref name="medscape.com" />

The precise reason for sudden respiratory depression is unclear, but there are several hypotheses:
* Saturation of the body fat compartment in patients with rapid and profound body fat loss (patients with cancer, cardiac or infection-induced [[cachexia]] can lose 80 % of their body fat).
* Early carbon dioxide retention causing cutaneous vasodilatation (releasing more fentanyl), together with acidosis, which reduces protein binding of fentanyl, releasing yet more fentanyl.
* Reduced sedation, losing a useful early warning sign of opioid toxicity and resulting in levels closer to respiratory-depressant levels.

==Pharmacology==
{{Main|Opioid#Pharmacology}}
Fentanyl provides some of the effects typical of other opioids through its agonism of the [[opioid receptors]]. Its strong potency in relation to that of morphine is largely due to its high [[lipophilicity]], per the [[Theories of general anaesthetic action#Lipid solubility-anaesthetic potency correlation (the Meyer-Overton correlation)|Meyer-Overton correlation]]. Because of this, it can more easily penetrate the [[Central Nervous System|CNS]].<ref name="medscape.com">Stacey Mayes, PharmD MS, Marcus Ferrone, PharmD BCNSP, 2006.[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/549359_3 Fentanyl HCl Patient-Controlled Iontophoretic Transdermal System for Pain: Pharmacology] ''The Annals of Pharmacotherapy''.</ref>

===Detection in biological fluids===
Fentanyl may be measured in blood or urine to monitor for abuse, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Commercially-available immunoassays are often used as initial screening tests, but chromatographic techniques are generally used for confirmation and quantitation. Blood or plasma fentanyl concentrations are expected to be in a range of 0.3–3.0 μg/l in persons using the drug therapeutically, 1–10 μg/l in intoxicated patients and 3-300 μg/l in victims of acute overdosage.<ref>Baselt, R. (2017) ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 11th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, pp. 883–886.</ref>

==History==
Fentanyl was first synthesized by [[Paul Janssen]] under the label of his relatively newly formed [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]] in 1959.<ref name=JanssenHist>{{cite journal|last1=Lopez-Munoz|first1=Francisco|last2=Alamo|first2=Cecilio|title=The Consolidation of Neuroleptic Therapy: Janssen, the Discovery of Haloperidol and Its Introduction into Clinical Practice|journal=Brain Research Bulletin|date=2009|volume=79|pages=130–141|pmid=19186209|doi=10.1016/j.brainresbull.2009.01.005|issue=2}}</ref> In the 1960s, fentanyl was introduced as an intravenous anaesthetic under the trade name of Sublimaze.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} In the mid-1990s, Janssen Pharmaceutica developed and introduced into clinical trials the Duragesic patch, which is a formation of an inert alcohol gel infused with select fentanyl doses, which are worn to provide constant administration of the opioid over a period of 48 to 72&nbsp;hours. After a set of successful clinical trials, Duragesic fentanyl patches were introduced into medical practice.

Following the patch, a flavoured [[lollipop]] of fentanyl citrate mixed with inert fillers was introduced under the brand name of Actiq, becoming the first quick-acting formation of fentanyl for use with chronic breakthrough pain. Fentanyl has been developed into an effervescent tab for [[Cheek|buccal]] absorption much like the Actiq lollipop, followed by a buccal spray device for fast-acting relief and other delivery methods currently in development.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

A fentanyl product has been approved by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for breakthrough cancer pain called Onsolis. It uses a drug delivery technology called BEMA (fentanyl buccal soluble film) on a small disc placed in the mouth. Unlike many other fentanyl products, the drug cannot be abused by crushing and inhaling.

Fentanyl has a US [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] [[Administrative Controlled Substances Code Number|ACSCN]] of 9801 and a 2013 annual aggregate manufacturing quota of 2,108.75&nbsp;kg, unchanged from the prior year.

===Legal action===
On June 19, 2007, a $5.5 million jury verdict was awarded in a US case against Johnson & Johnson subsidiaries, Alza Corporation and Janssen Pharmaceutica Products, the manufacturers of the Duragesic fentanyl transdermal pain patch. This case, the first Federal trial involving the Duragesic fentanyl patch, was tried in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of Florida, West Palm Beach Division.

===Public health advisories===
The US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has issued public health advisories related to fentanyl patch dangers. Among these, in July 2005, the FDA issued a Public Health Advisory,<ref name="fda.gov">{{cite web|url= http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm114961.htm |title= Fentanyl Transdermal System (marketed as Duragesic) Information |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |date= |access-date=2013-09-10}}</ref> which advised that "deaths and overdoses have occurred in patients using both the brand name product Duragesic and the generic product." In December 2007, as part of this continuing investigation, the FDA issued a second Public Health Advisory<ref name="fda.gov" /> stating, "The FDA has continued to receive reports of deaths and life-threatening side effects in patients who use the fentanyl patch. The reports indicate that doctors have inappropriately prescribed the fentanyl patch... In addition, the reports indicate that patients are continuing to incorrectly use the fentanyl patch..."

[[Substance abuse|Illicit use]] of pharmaceutical fentanyl and its analogues first appeared in the mid-1970s in the medical community and continues in the present. United States authorities classify fentanyl as a [[narcotic]] and an [[opioid]]. To date, more than 12 different analogues of fentanyl have been produced [[clandestine chemistry|clandestinely]] and identified in the U.S. drug traffic. The biological effects of the fentanyl analogues are similar to those of heroin, with the exception that many users report a noticeably less euphoric high associated with the drug and stronger sedative and analgesic effects.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Fentanyl analogues may be hundreds of times more potent than street heroin, and tend to produce significantly more [[respiratory depression]], making it much more dangerous than heroin to users. Fentanyl is used orally, smoked, snorted, or injected. Fentanyl is sometimes sold as heroin or [[oxycodone]], often leading to overdoses. Many fentanyl overdoses are initially classified as heroin overdoses.<ref>Boddiger, D. (2006, August 12).[http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2806%2969181-2/fulltext Fentanyl-laced street drugs "kill hundreds"]. ''[[The Lancet]]''. Retrieved June 15, 2010.</ref> [[Estonia]] has the highest rate of [[3-methylfentanyl]] overdose deaths in the EU, due to its high rate of recreational use.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17524945 |title=Synthetic drug fentanyl causes overdose boom in Estonia |publisher=BBC News |date=30 March 2012}}</ref>

Fentanyl is sometimes sold on the black market in the form of transdermal fentanyl patches such as [[Duragesic]], diverted from legitimate medical supplies. The gel from inside the patches may be ingested or injected.<ref name=DEA2015 />

Another form of fentanyl that has appeared on the streets is the Actiq lollipop formulation. The pharmacy retail price ranges from $15 to $50 per unit based on the strength of the lozenge, with the black market cost ranging from $5 to $25, depending on the dose.<ref name="trib2">"[http://opioids.com/fentanyl/actiq.html Painkiller is topic of inquiry]", Bob Mims, ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'', 11 November 2004</ref> The attorneys general of Connecticut and Pennsylvania have launched investigations into its diversion from the legitimate pharmaceutical market, including Cephalon's "sales and promotional practices for [[Provigil]], Actiq and [[Gabitril]]".<ref name="trib2" />

Non-medical use of fentanyl by individuals without opiate tolerance can be very dangerous and has resulted in numerous deaths.<ref name=DEA2015>{{cite web |url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_chem_info/fentanyl.pdf |title=Fentanyl |date=March 2015 |publisher=[[Drug Enforcement Administration]]}}</ref> Even those with opiate tolerances are at high risk for overdoses. Once the fentanyl is in the user's system, it is extremely difficult to stop its course because of the nature of absorption. Illicitly synthesized fentanyl powder has also appeared on the United States market. Because of the extremely high strength of pure fentanyl powder, it is very difficult to dilute appropriately, and often the resulting mixture may be far too strong and, therefore, very dangerous.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Some heroin dealers mix fentanyl powder with heroin to increase potency or compensate for low-quality heroin. In 2006, illegally manufactured, non-pharmaceutical fentanyl often mixed with [[cocaine]] or heroin caused an outbreak of overdose deaths in the United States and Canada, heavily concentrated in the cities of Dayton, Ohio; Chicago; Detroit; and Philadelphia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5729a1.htm |title=CDC Nonpharmaceutical Fentanyl-Related Deaths – Multiple States, April 2005 – March 2007 |publisher=Cdc.gov |access-date=2010-07-28}}</ref>

Several large quantities of illicitly produced fentanyl have been seized by U.S. law enforcement agencies.

The DEA reported that millions of pills could have been distributed from this location over the course of time. The accused owned a pill press and ordered fentanyl in powder form from China.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/news/4623595-155/thousands-of-fentanyl-pills-confiscated-in|title=Thousands of fentanyl pills confiscated in Utah drug raid|last=Tribune|first=Courtney Tanner |newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fox13now.com/2016/11/22/dea-investigating-drug-operation-near-cottonwood-heights-school/|title=Cottonwood Heights drug bust one of the largest in Utah history|date=2016-11-22 |publisher=fox13now.com|access-date=2016-11-23}}</ref>

In a separate study conducted by the CDC, 82% of fentanyl overdose deaths involved illegally manufactured fentanyl, while only 4% were suspected to originate from a prescription.<ref>{{cite report |title=Characteristics of Fentanyl Overdose — Massachusetts, 2014–2016 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date=April 14, 2017}}</ref>

Beginning in 2015, Canada has seen a widespread number of fentanyl overdoses. Authorities suspect that the drug is being imported from Asia to the western coast by organized crime groups in powder form and being pressed into pseudo-OxyContin tablets.<ref>[http://www.metronews.ca/news/canada/2015/08/06/lethal-fentanyl-profiting-gangs-in-western-canada-while-deaths-climb.html Lethal fentanyl profiting gangs in Western Canada while deaths climb], Metro News Edmonton, August 6, 2015.</ref> Traces of the drug have also been found in other recreational drugs including cocaine, [[MDMA]], and heroin.

===Incapacitating agent===
{{Main|Moscow hostage crisis chemical agent}}
Russian [[spetsnaz]] security forces used a "fentanyl gas" to incapacitate people rapidly in the [[Moscow theater hostage crisis]] in 2002. The siege was ended, but about 130 of the 850 hostages died from the gas. The Russian Health Minister later stated that the gas was based on fentanyl,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2377563.stm |title=Russia names Moscow Siege Gas |date=October 31, 2002 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref> but the exact chemical agent has not been identified.

==Veterinary use==
Fentanyl in injectable formulation is commonly used for analgesia and as a component of balanced sedation and general anaesthesia in small animal patients. Its potency and short duration of action make it particularly useful in critically ill patients. In addition, it tends to cause less vomiting and regurgitation than other pure-opioid agonists (morphine, hydromorphone) when given as a continuous post-operative infusion. As with other pure opioids, fentanyl can be associated with [[dysphoria]] in both dogs and cats.

[[Transdermal]] fentanyl has also been used for many years in dogs and cats for post-operative analgesia. This is usually done with off-label fentanyl patches manufactured for humans with chronic pain. In 2012 a highly concentrated (50&nbsp;mg/ml) transdermal solution, trade name ''Recuvyra'', has become commercially available for dogs only. It is FDA approved to provide four days of analgesia after a single application prior to surgery. It is not approved for multiple doses or other species.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/Products/ApprovedAnimalDrugProducts/FOIADrugSummaries/UCM314828.pdf|title=Original new animal drug application: Recuvyra|publisher=}}</ref> The drug is also approved in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/veterinary/medicines/002239/vet_med_000245.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058008d7a8|title=European Medicines Agency – Veterinary medicines – Recuvyra|publisher=|access-date=28 March 2016}}</ref>
