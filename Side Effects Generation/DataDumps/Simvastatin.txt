==Medical uses==
The primary uses of simvastatin are to treat [[dyslipidemia]] and to prevent atherosclerosis-related complications such as stroke and heart attacks in those who are at high risk.<ref name="AHFS2015"/> It is recommended to be used as an addition to a low cholesterol diet.<ref name="AHFS2015"/>

In the [[Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study]] (a placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of 5 years duration), simvastatin reduced overall mortality in people with existing cardiovascular disease and high LDL cholesterol by 30% and reduced cardiovascular mortality by 42%. The risks of heart attack, stroke, or needing a coronary revascularization procedure were reduced by 37%, 28%, and 37% respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2015/019766s093lbl.pdf|title=www.accessdata.fda.gov|format=|work=|accessdate=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208172832/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2015/019766s093lbl.pdf|archivedate=2015-12-08|df=}}</ref>

The [[Heart Protection Study]] evaluated the effects of simvastatin in people with risk factors including existing cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or stroke but having relatively low LDL cholesterol.  In this trial, which lasted 5.4 years, overall mortality was reduced by 13% and cardiovascular mortality was reduced by 18%.  People receiving simvastatin experienced 38% fewer non-fatal heart attacks and 25% fewer strokes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2015/019766s093lbl.pdf|title=www.accessdata.fda.gov|format=|work=|accessdate=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208172832/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2015/019766s093lbl.pdf|archivedate=2015-12-08|df=}}</ref>

In March 2012, the FDA updated its guidance for statin users to address reports of memory loss, liver damage, increased blood sugar, development of [[type 2 diabetes]], and muscle injury.<ref>{{cite web|title=FDA Expands Advice on Statin Risks|url=http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm293330.htm|publisher=FDA|accessdate=12 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629162246/http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm293330.htm|archivedate=29 June 2012|df=}}</ref> The new guidance indicates:
* FDA has found that liver injury associated with statin use is rare but can occur.
* The reports about memory loss, forgetfulness, and confusion span all statin products and all age groups. The FDA says these experiences are rare but that those affected often report feeling “fuzzy” or unfocused in their thinking.
* A small increased risk of raised blood sugar levels and the development of type 2 diabetes have been reported with the use of statins.
* Some drugs interact with statins in a way that increases the risk of muscle injury called myopathy, characterized by unexplained muscle weakness or pain.

==Interactions==
Simvastatin has important interactions with [[grapefruit]] juice and other drugs, including some that are commonly used for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.  These interactions are clinically important because increasing simvastatin serum levels above those normally provided by the maximum recommended dose increases the risk of muscle damage, including the otherwise rare and potentially fatal side effect of [[rhabdomyolysis]].<ref name="FDAJun2011"/>

All statins act by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG) coenzyme A reductase.

Statins are more effective than other lipid-regulating drugs at lowering LDL-[[cholesterol]] concentration, but they are less effective than the fibrates in reducing triglyceride concentration. However, statins reduce cardiovascular disease events and total mortality irrespective of the initial cholesterol concentration. This is a major piece of evidence that statins work in another way than the lowering of cholesterol (called pleiotropic effects).<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 21391729 | year = 2010 | last1 = Pedersen | first1 = TR | title = Pleiotropic effects of statins: Evidence against benefits beyond LDL-cholesterol lowering | volume = 10 Suppl 1 | pages = 10–7 | doi = 10.2165/1158822-S0-000000000-00000 | journal = American Journal of Cardiovascular Drugs}}</ref>

The drug is in the form of an inactive [[lactone]] that is [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] after ingestion to produce the active agent. It is a white, [[nonhygroscopic]], crystalline powder that is practically insoluble in water, and freely soluble in [[chloroform]], [[methanol]], and [[ethanol]].

Simvastatin is an effective [[lipid]]-lowering drug that can decrease [[low density lipoprotein]] (LDL) levels by up to 50%.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
Recently, simvastatin had been shown to interact with lipid lowering transcription factor PPAR-alpha (Roy etal. Cell Metabolism 2015) and that interaction might control the neurotrophic action of the drug.

==History==
The development of simvastatin was closely linked with [[lovastatin]]. Biochemist Jesse Huff and his colleagues at Merck began researching the biosynthesis of cholesterol in the early 1950s.<ref>{{cite book |author=Jie Jack Li |title=Triumph of the Heart : The Story of Statins |pages=59 |year=2009 | isbn = 0198043511 | publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> In 1956, [[mevalonic acid]] was isolated from a yeast extract by [[Karl Folkers]], Carl Hoffman, and others at Merck, while Huff and his associates confirmed that mevalonic acid was an intermediate in cholesterol biosynthesis. In 1959, the [[HMG-CoA reductase]] enzyme (a major contributor of internal cholesterol production) was discovered by researchers at the [[Max Planck Institute]]. This discovery encouraged scientists worldwide to find an effective inhibitor of this enzyme.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

By 1976, [[Akira Endo (biochemist)|Akira Endo]] had isolated the first inhibitor, [[mevastatin]], from the [[fungus]] ''[[Penicillium|Penicillium citrinium]]'' while working at [[Daiichi Sankyo]] in Japan.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Liao JK, Laufs U |title=Pleiotropic effects of statins |journal=Annu.

While developing and researching lovastatin, Merck scientists synthetically derived a more potent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor from a fermentation product of ''A. terreus'', which was designated MK-733 (later to be named simvastatin).<ref name="preview">{{cite book |title=Innovation Management - Strategies, Implementation, and Profits |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~afuah/ |editor=Allan Afuah |year=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |author1=Olivia Williams |author2=Anne-Marie Jacks |author3=Jim Davis |author4=Sabrina Martinez |chapter=Case 10: Merck(A): Mevacor |chapterurl=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~afuah/cases/case10.html |isbn=0-19-511346-2 |accessdate=2006-07-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060809153819/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~afuah/ |archivedate=2006-08-09 |df= }}</ref>

In 1994, publication of the results of the [[Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study]] (4S) provided the first unequivocal evidence that lowering LDL cholesterol via statin treatment reduces cardiovascular events and overall mortality.  A total of 4,444 people with coronary heart disease 5.5 to 8.0&nbsp;mmol/L were randomized to simvastatin treatment or placebo and followed for an average of 5 years. Compared to the placebo group, those treated with simvastatin experienced a 30% decrease in overall mortality, a 42% reduction in coronary death, a 34% reduction in major coronary events, and a 37% reduction in revascularization procedures.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Tobert JA |title=Lovastatin and beyond: the history of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors |journal=Nat Rev Drug Discov |volume=2 |issue=7 |pages=517–26 |year=2003 |pmid=12815379 |doi=10.1038/nrd1112 |url=}}</ref>

==Society and culture==

===Economics===
Simvastatin was introduced in the late 1980s, and since 2006 in many countries, it is available as a [[Generic drug|generic]] preparation. This has led to a decrease of the price of most statin drugs, and a reappraisal of the health economics of preventive statin treatment.  In the UK in 2008, the typical per-patient cost to the NHS of simvastatin was about £1.50 per month.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/politics_show/7192271.stm |title=NHS overspends on statins |date=Jan 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214163933/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/politics_show/7192271.stm |archivedate=2009-02-14 |df= }}</ref> (40&nbsp;mg/day costs UK NHS £1.37/month in 2012<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cks.nhs.uk/diabetes_type_2/drugs_in_this_topic/scenario_managing_lipids/simvastatin_40mg_tablets |title=Simvastatin 40mg tablets }}</ref>)

Prior to losing U.S. patent protection, simvastatin was Merck & Co.'s largest-selling drug and second-largest-selling cholesterol lowering drug in the world. In 2005, recorded US$3.1&nbsp;[[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] of sales in the US and US$4.4&nbsp;[[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Berenson|first1=Alex|title=Merck Loses Protection for Patent on Zocor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/23/business/23statin.html?_r=0|accessdate=14 January 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=23 June 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114212534/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/23/business/23statin.html?_r=0|archivedate=14 January 2015|df=}}</ref>

Zocor had an original patent expiry date of January 2006, but was extended by the United States Patent Trademark Office (PTO) to expire on June 23, 2006.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The PTO granted the patent extension after Merck submitted data from studies of the drug’s positive effect on children. In the UK, the patent for simvastatin had expired by 2004.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In the UK, simvastatin is the most prescribed medication in the community, with 39.9 million items dispensed in 2013. This compares to 30.9 million items for [[aspirin]], and 27.7 million for [[levothyroxine sodium]], the second and third most prescribed drugs in the UK in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Twenty most prescribed drugs in the community in England in 2013|url=http://www.qualitywatch.org.uk/indicator/antibiotic-prescribing|website=QualityWatch|publisher=Nuffield Trust & Health Foundation|accessdate=14 January 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114213112/http://www.qualitywatch.org.uk/indicator/antibiotic-prescribing|archivedate=14 January 2015|df=}}</ref>
