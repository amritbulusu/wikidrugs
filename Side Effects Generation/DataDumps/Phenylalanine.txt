'''Phenylalanine''' (<small>US:</small> {{IPAc-en|ˌ|f|ɛ|n|əl|ˈ|æ|l|ə|n|iː|n}}, <small>UK:</small> {{IPAc-en|ˌ|f|iː|n|aɪ|l|ˈ|æ|l|ə|n|iː|n}}; abbreviated as '''Phe''' or '''F''')<ref>{{ cite web | author = IUPAC-IUBMB Joint Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature | title = Nomenclature and Symbolism for Amino Acids and Peptides | year = 1983 | work = Recommendations on Organic & Biochemical Nomenclature, Symbols & Terminology etc. | url = http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/AminoAcid/ | accessdate = 2007-05-17 }}</ref> is an α-[[amino acid]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] {{chem|C|9|H|11|N|O|2}}. It can be viewed as a [[benzyl]] group [[substituent|substituted]] for the [[methyl group]] of [[alanine]], or a [[phenyl]] group in place of a terminal hydrogen of alanine. This [[essential amino acid]] is classified as neutral, and [[chemical polarity|nonpolar]] because of the inert and [[hydrophobic]] nature of the [[benzyl]] side chain. The [[chirality (chemistry)#Naming conventions|<small>L</small>-isomer]] is used to biochemically form [[protein]]s, coded for by [[DNA]]. The [[codons]] for <small>L</small>-phenylalanine are UUU and UUC. Phenylalanine is a precursor for [[tyrosine]]; the [[monoamine neurotransmitter]]s [[dopamine]], [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline), and [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline); and the skin [[pigment]] [[melanin]].

Phenylalanine is found naturally in the [[breast milk]] of mammals. It is used in the manufacture of food and drink products and sold as a nutritional supplement for its reputed [[analgesic]] and [[antidepressant]] effects.  It is a direct precursor to the [[neuromodulation|neuromodulator]] [[phenethylamine]], a commonly used [[dietary supplement]]. As an essential amino acid, phenylalanine is not synthesized [[De novo synthesis|de novo]] in humans and other animals, who must ingest phenylalanine or phenylalanine-containing proteins.

==History==
The first description of phenylalanine was made in 1879, when Schulze and Barbieri identified a compound with the [[empirical formula]], C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>11</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>, in [[Lupinus luteus|yellow lupine]] (''Lupinus luteus'') seedlings. In 1882, [[Emil Erlenmeyer|Erlenmeyer]] and Lipp first synthesized phenylalanine from [[phenylacetaldehyde]], hydrogen cyanide, and ammonia.<ref>{{ cite book | vauthors = Thorpe TE | authorlink = Thomas Edward Thorpe | title = A Dictionary of Applied Chemistry | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6uVYAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA191 | accessdate = 2012-06-04 | year = 1913 | publisher = Longmans, Green, and Co. | pages = 191–193 }}</ref><ref>{{ cite book | vauthors = Plimmer RH | veditors = Plimmer RH,  Hopkins FG | title = The Chemical Composition of the Proteins | url = https://books.google.com/?id=7JM8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA93 | accessdate = 2012-06-04 | edition = 2nd | series = Monographs on Biochemistry | volume = Part I. Analysis | origyear = 1908 | year = 1912 | publisher = Longmans, Green and Co. | location = London | pages = 93–97 }}</ref>

The genetic [[codon]] for phenylalanine was first discovered by [[J. Heinrich Matthaei]] and [[Marshall W. Nirenberg]] in 1961. They showed that by using [[messenger RNA|mRNA]] to insert multiple [[uracil]] repeats into the [[genome]] of the [[bacterium]] ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', they could cause the bacterium to produce a [[peptide|polypeptide]] consisting solely of repeated phenylalanine amino acids. This discovery helped to establish the nature of the [[coding strand|coding]] relationship that links information stored in [[genome|genomic]] nucleic acid with [[proteome|protein expression]] in the living cell.

==Dietary sources==
Good sources of phenylalanine are eggs, chicken, liver, beef, milk, and soybeans.<ref name="RossRoth1991">{{cite book | first1 = Harvey M. | last1 = Ross | first2 = June | last2 = Roth | name-list-format = vanc | title = The Mood Control Diet: 21 Days to Conquering Depression and Fatigue | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hHWQCZvGUMEC | date = 1 April 1991 | publisher = Simon & Schuster | isbn = 978-0-13-590449-7 | page = 59 }}</ref>

==Dietary Recommendations==
The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the U.S. Institute of Medicine set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for [[essential amino acid]]s in 2002. For phenylalanine plus tyrosine, for adults 19 years and older, 33 mg/kg body weight/day.<ref name="DRItext">{{cite book | last1 = [[Institute of Medicine]] | title = Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrates, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids | chapter = Protein and Amino Acids | publisher = The National Academies Press | year = 2002 | location = Washington, DC | pages = 589–768 | url = https://www.nap.edu/read/10490/chapter/12}}</ref>

==Other biological roles==
<small>L</small>-Phenylalanine is biologically converted into <small>L</small>-[[tyrosine]], another one of the DNA-encoded amino acids.  <small>L</small>-tyrosine in turn is converted into [[L-DOPA]], which is further converted into [[dopamine]], [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline), and [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline). The latter three are known as the [[catecholamines]].

Phenylalanine uses the same active transport channel as [[tryptophan]] to cross the [[blood–brain barrier]]. In excessive quantities, supplementation can interfere with the production of [[serotonin]] and other [[aromatic amino acid]]s as well as [[nitric oxide]] due to the overuse (eventually, limited availability) of the associated cofactors, [[iron]] or [[tetrahydrobiopterin]]. The corresponding enzymes in for those compounds are the [[aromatic amino acid hydroxylase]] family and [[nitric oxide synthase]].{{Phenylalanine biosynthesis|caption=Phenylalanine in humans may ultimately be metabolized into a range of different substances.}}<!--

===In plants===
Phenylalanine is the starting compound used in the [[biosynthesis|synthesis]] of  [[flavonoid]]s.  [[Lignan]] is derived from phenylalanine and from [[tyrosine]]. Phenylalanine is converted to [[cinnamic acid]] by the enzyme [[phenylalanine ammonia-lyase]].<ref name=Nelson>{{ cite book | vauthors = Nelson DL, Cox MM | title = Lehninger, Principles of Biochemistry | edition = 3rd | publisher = Worth Publishing | location = New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 1-57259-153-6 }}</ref>

==Phenylketonuria==
{{main article|Phenylketonuria}}
The genetic disorder [[phenylketonuria]] (PKU) is the inability to metabolize phenylalanine because of a lack of the enzyme [[phenylalanine hydroxylase]]. Individuals with this disorder are known as "phenylketonurics" and must regulate their intake of phenylalanine. Phenylketonurics often use blood tests to monitor the amount of phenylalanine in their blood.  Lab results may report phenylalanine levels using either mg/dL and μmol/L. One mg/dL of phenylalanine is approximately equivalent to 60 μmol/L.

A (rare) "variant form" of phenylketonuria called [[hyperphenylalaninemia]] is caused by the inability to synthesize a [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] called [[tetrahydrobiopterin]], which can be supplemented. Pregnant women with hyperphenylalaninemia may show similar symptoms of the disorder (high levels of phenylalanine in blood) but these indicators will usually disappear at the end of gestation.  Pregnant women with PKU must control their blood phenylalanine levels even if the fetus is heterozygous for the defective gene because the fetus could be adversely affected due to hepatic immaturity.{{medcn|date=April 2016}} 

A non-food source of phenylalanine is the artificial sweetener [[aspartame]]. This compound, sold under the trade names [[Equal_(sweetener)|Equal]] and [[NutraSweet]], is metabolized by the body into several chemical byproducts including phenylalanine. The breakdown problems phenylketonurics have with the buildup of phenylalanine in the body also occurs with the ingestion of aspartame, although to a lesser degree. Accordingly, all products in Australia, the U.S. and Canada that contain aspartame must be labeled: "Phenylketonurics: Contains phenylalanine." In the UK, foods containing aspartame must carry ingredient panels that refer to the presence of "aspartame or E951"<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/additivesbranch/sweeteners/55174#h_4 | title = Aspartame | publisher = Food Standards Agency | location = UK }}</ref> and they must be labeled with a warning "Contains a source of phenylalanine." In Brazil, the label "Contém Fenilalanina" (Portuguese for "Contains Phenylalanine") is also mandatory in products which contain it. These warnings are placed to help individuals avoid such foods.

Geneticists have recently sequenced the genome of [[macaques]]. Their investigations have found "some instances where the normal form of the macaque protein looks like the diseased human protein" including markers for PKU.<ref name = "Gibbs_2007"/>

==<small>D</small>-, <small>L</small>- and <small>DL</small>-phenylalanine==
The [[stereoisomer]] <small>D</small>-phenylalanine (DPA) can be produced by conventional [[organic synthesis]], either as a single [[enantiomer]] or as a component of the [[racemic]] mixture. It does not participate in [[protein biosynthesis]] although it is found in proteins in small amounts - particularly aged proteins and food proteins that have been [[processed food|processed]]. The biological functions of <small>D</small>-amino acids remain unclear, although <small>D</small>-phenylalanine has [[pharmacological activity]] at [[niacin receptor 2]].<ref>{{cite web|title=D-phenylalanine|url=http://www.iuphar-db.org/DATABASE/LigandDisplayForward?tab=biology&ligandId=5797|website=IUPHAR|accessdate=24 June 2014}}</ref>

<small>DL</small>-Phenylalanine (DLPA) is marketed as a nutritional supplement for its purported [[analgesic]] and [[antidepressant]] activities.  <small>DL</small>-Phenylalanine is a mixture of <small>D</small>-phenylalanine and <small>L</small>-phenylalanine. The reputed analgesic activity of <small>DL</small>-phenylalanine may be explained by the possible blockage by <small>D</small>-phenylalanine of [[enkephalin]]  [[Chemical decomposition|degradation]] by the [[enzyme]] [[carboxypeptidase A]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Christianson DW, Mangani S, Shoham G, Lipscomb WN | title = Binding of D-phenylalanine and D-tyrosine to carboxypeptidase A | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 264 | issue = 22 | pages = 12849–53 | date = August 1989 | pmid = 2568989 | url = http://www.jbc.org/content/264/22/12849.full.pdf | format = pdf }}</ref> The mechanism of <small>DL</small>-phenylalanine's supposed antidepressant activity may be accounted for by the [[protein precursor|precursor]] role of <small>L</small>-phenylalanine in the synthesis of the [[neurotransmitters]] [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]]. Elevated brain levels of norepinephrine and dopamine are thought to have an antidepressant effect.  <small>D</small>-Phenylalanine is absorbed from the small intestine and transported to the liver via the [[portal circulation]]. A small amount of <small>D</small>-phenylalanine appears to be converted to <small>L</small>-phenylalanine. <small>D</small>-Phenylalanine is distributed to the various tissues of the body via the [[systemic circulation]]. It appears to cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] less efficiently than <small>L</small>-phenylalanine, and so a small amount of an ingested dose of <small>D</small>-phenylalanine is excreted in the [[urine]] without penetrating the central nervous system.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}
