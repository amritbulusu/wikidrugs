'''Enrofloxacin''' (ENR) is a [[fluoroquinolone]] antibiotic sold by the [[Bayer|Bayer Corporation]] under the trade name '''Baytril'''. Enrofloxacin is currently approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] for the treatment of individual pets and domestic animals in the United States. In September 2005, the FDA withdrew approval of Baytril for use in water to treat flocks of poultry, as this practice was noted to promote the evolution of fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of the bacterium ''[[Campylobacter]]'', a human pathogen.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/cvm/FQWithdrawal.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210231646/http://www.fda.gov/cvm/FQWithdrawal.html |archivedate=2007-02-10 |df= }}</ref>

It is a [[bactericidal]] agent. The bactericidal activity of enrofloxacin is concentration-dependent, with susceptible bacteria cell death occurring within 20–30 minutes of exposure. Enrofloxacin has demonstrated a significant post-antibiotic effect for both [[Gram-negative]]  and [[Gram-positive]] bacteria and is active in both stationary and growth phases of bacterial replication. Enrofloxacin is partially deethylated by CYP450 into the active metabolite [[ciprofloxacin]], which is also a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, used preferentially in humans.

==Activity and susceptibility data==
Enrofloxacin is a synthetic antibacterial agent from the class of the [[fluoroquinolone]] carboxylic acid derivatives. It has antibacterial activity against a broad spectrum of [[Gram-negative]] and [[Gram-positive]] bacteria. It is effective against:
* ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''
* ''[[Klebsiella]]''
* ''[[Escherichia coli]]''
* ''[[Enterobacter]]''
* ''[[Campylobacter]]''
* ''[[Shigella]]''
* ''[[Salmonella]]''
* ''[[Aeromonas]]''
* ''[[Haemophilus]]''
* ''[[Proteus (bacterium)|Proteus]]''
* ''[[Yersinia]]''
* ''[[Serratia]]''
* ''[[Vibrio]]''
* ''[[Brucella]]''
* ''[[Chlamydia trachomatis]]''
* ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' (including penicillinase-producing and methicillin-resistant strains)
* ''[[Mycoplasma]]''
* ''[[Mycobacterium]]''

Variable activity against:
* ''[[Streptococcus]]''

Ineffective against:
* [[Anaerobic organism|Anaerobe]]s

The following data represent minimum inhibitory concentration ranges for a few medically significant bacterial pathogens:
* ''Escherichia coli'' - 0.022 - 0.03&nbsp;µg/ml
* ''Staphylococcus aureus'' - 0.0925 - 64&nbsp;µg/ml
* ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' - 0.05&nbsp;µg/ml

==Contraindications/precautions==
Usage in poultry.

==Adverse effects/warnings==

Enrofloxacin was banned for poultry use in 2005.<ref>Washington Post, April 30, 2005 FDA Calls Efforts For Bayer Illegal
Lawmakers' Help for Drug Firm Tests Limits Dan Morgan and Marc Kaufman</ref>

==Overdosage/acute toxicity==
It is unlikely that an acute overdose of either compound would result in symptoms more serious than either anorexia or vomiting, but the adverse effects noted above could occur. Dogs receiving 10 times the labeled dosage rate of enrofloxacin for at least 14 days developed only vomiting and anorexia. Death did occur in some dogs when fed 25 times the labeled rate for 11 days, however.
* Oral {{LD50}}: greater than 5000&nbsp;mg/kg
* Dermal LD<sub>50</sub>: greater than 2000&nbsp;mg/kg
* Inhalation LD<sub>50</sub>: greater than 3547&nbsp;mg/m3 (4-hour exposure)
* Eye effects: irritant; reversible in less than 7 days.  In cats, it can produce sudden onset blindness when administered by injection, as it is retinotoxic.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Degradation==
The brown rot fungus ''[[Gloeophyllum]] striatum'' can degrade the fluoroquinolone enrofloxacin using hydroxyl radicals.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=9361414|title=Degradation of the fluoroquinolone enrofloxacin by the brown rot fungus Gloeophyllum striatum: identification of metabolites|author1=Wetzstein HG|author2=Schmeer N|author3=Karl W|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|volume=63|pages=4272–81|pmc=168747|year=1997}}
