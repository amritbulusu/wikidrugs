'''Pegloticase''' (trade name '''Krystexxa''') is a medication for the treatment of severe, treatment-refractory, chronic [[gout]]. It is a third line treatment in those in whom other treatments are not tolerated.<ref name=Lancet2016/> The drug is administered by infusion [[intravenous]]ly.

It was developed by [[Savient Pharmaceuticals]].<ref name="USAN">[http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/365/pegloticase.pdf Statement on a nonproprietary name adopted by the USAN Council]</ref><ref>[http://www.savientpharma.com/pipeline/puricase.asp Savient Pharmaceuticals: Uricase]</ref> In September 2010, the FDA approved pegloticase for marketing in the United States after two clinical trials demonstrated the drug lowered uric acid levels and reduced deposits of uric acid crystals in joints and soft tissue. The [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) granted marketing authorization in 2013 for treatment of disabling tophaceous gout. In 2016 this authorization was ended in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|title=Krystexxa Withdrawal of the marketing authorisation in the European Union|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Public_statement/2016/07/WC500210911.pdf|accessdate=25 March 2017}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
It is an option for the 3% of people with gout who are intolerant to other medications.<ref name=FDA2010>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm225810.htm |title=FDA approves new drug for gout |work=FDA |date=September 14, 2010}}</ref> Pegloticase is given as an intravenous infusion every two weeks,<ref name=FDA2010/> and has been found to reduce uric acid levels in this population.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Sundy JS, Baraf HS, Yood RA, Edwards NL, Gutierrez-Urena SR, Treadwell EL, Vázquez-Mellado J, White WB, Lipsky PE, Horowitz Z, Huang W, Maroli AN, Waltrip RW, Hamburger SA, Becker MA |title=Efficacy and tolerability of pegloticase for the treatment of chronic gout in patients refractory to conventional treatment: two randomized controlled trials|journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association|date=Aug 17, 2011|volume=306|issue=7|pages=711–20|pmid=21846852|doi=10.1001/jama.2011.1169}}</ref> It is likely useful for tophi but has a high rate of side effects.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sriranganathan|first1=MK|last2=Vinik|first2=O|last3=Bombardier|first3=C|last4=Edwards|first4=CJ|title=Interventions for tophi in gout|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=Oct 20, 2014|volume=10|issue=10|pages=CD010069|pmid=25330136|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010069.pub2}}</ref> About 40% of people develop resistance to the medication over time.<ref name=Lancet2016>{{cite journal|last1=Dalbeth|first1=N|last2=Merriman|first2=TR|last3=Stamp|first3=LK|title=Gout.|journal=Lancet|date=22 October 2016|volume=388|issue=10055|pages=2039–2052|pmid=27112094}}</ref>

==Side effects==
In individuals with [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]], pegloticase may precipitate a severe, life-threatening [[hemolysis]] with [[methemoglobinemia]]; it is therefore contraindicated in such individuals. Pegloticase may also show [[immunogenicity]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Abraham J. Domb, Neeraj Kumar|title=Biodegradable Polymers in Clinical Use and Clinical Development|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LUOQu6_kLZQC&dq=immunogenicity+Pegloticase|date=2 August 2011|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|isbn=9781118015803}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Pegloticase is a recombinant [[porcine]]-like [[uricase]]. Similarly to [[rasburicase]], it metabolises [[uric acid]] to [[allantoin]]. This reduces the risk of precipitates, since allantoin is five to ten times more soluble than uric acid.

In contrast to rasburicase, pegloticase is [[pegylated]] to increase its elimination half-life from about eight hours to ten or twelve days, and to decrease the immunogenicity of the foreign uricase protein. This modification allows for an application just once every two to four weeks, making this drug suitable for long-term treatment.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Biggers|first=K|author2=Scheinfeldt, N|date=2008|journal=Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs|volume=9|issue=4|pages=422–429|pmid=18393109|title=Pegloticase, a polyethylene glycol conjugate of uricase for the potential intravenous treatment of gout}}</ref>

== Chemistry ==
Pegloticase is a [[tetramer]]ic protein composed of four identical chains of about 300 [[amino acid]]s each. Approximately nine of the 30 [[lysine]] residues in each chain are pegylated. These PEG chains consist of about 225 [[ethylene glycol]] units each (10&nbsp;kg/mol PEG).<ref name="USAN" />
