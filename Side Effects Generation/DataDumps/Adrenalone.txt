'''Adrenalone''' is an [[adrenergic agonist]] used as a topical [[vasoconstrictor]] and [[hemostatic]]. Formerly, it was also used to prolong the action of [[local anesthetic]]s. It is the [[ketone]] form of [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline). Contrary to epinephrine, adrenalone mainly acts on [[alpha-1 adrenergic receptor]]s, but has little affinity for beta receptors. The drug is largely obsolete, being superseded by other hemostatics such as [[thrombin]], [[fibrinogen]], and [[vasopressin analogue]]s.<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile">

==Contraindications and interactions==
Adrenalone does not stop bleeding from large blood vessels. It is not approved for systemic use. Combination with [[antithrombotic]]s is not useful because they contravene the action of adrenalone.<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" />

==Side effects==
Vasoconstriction by adrenalone may lead to local [[necrosis]].<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" />

==Pregnancy and lactation==
Adrenalone passes into breast milk, but adverse effects are unlikely because of its very low systemic resorption.<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" />

==Chemical properties==
Adrenalone is a derivative of epinephrine, having the alcohol function replaced with a ketone. As a consequence, it is not [[optically active]] any more.

Solubility in water, [[ethanol]] and [[diethyl ether]] is low. The substance is typically used in form of the [[hydrochloride]], a white crystalline powder which tastes bitter and slightly acidic, and is soluble in water (1:8) and 94% ethanol (1:45). The melting point of the hydrochloride is {{convert|243|°C|°F}}.<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" />

==Pharmacology==
After local application, only traces of adrenalone are found in the blood, which is partly a consequence of the vasoconstriction caused by the drug via alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. In an (unspecified) pharmacological model, [[hypertensive]] (blood pressure increasing) action has been found to be about 0.5% that of epinephrine at equivalent plasma concentrations. Therefore, systemic effects are unlikely.

Like epinephrine, adrenalone is metabolised by [[catechol-O-methyl transferase]] (COMT), yielding 3O-methyladrenalone, which in turn is N-demethylized by [[monoamine oxidase]] (MAO). Alternatively, it can first undergo metabolization by MAO and then by COMT; in both cases, the resulting 3O-methyl-N-demethyladrenalone is conjugated to [[sulfate]] or [[glucuronide]] and excreted by the kidney. No reduction to epinephrine has been observed ''in vivo''.<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" />
