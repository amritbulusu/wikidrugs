'''Methoprene''' is a [[juvenile hormone]] (JH) [[analog (chemistry)|analog]] which acts as a growth regulator when used as an [[insecticide]].  It is an amber-colored liquid with a faint fruity odor which is essentially nontoxic to humans when ingested or inhaled. It is used in drinking water cisterns to control mosquitoes which spread dengue fever and malaria.<ref>{{cite web | work = Water Sanitation and Health | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | title = Methoprene | url= http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/methoprenesum_2ndadd.pdf | year = 2008 }}</ref>

Methoprene does not kill insects.  Instead, it acts as an [[insect growth regulator]], mimicking natural [[juvenile hormone]].  Juvenile hormone must be absent for a [[pupa]] to molt to an adult, so methoprene-treated larvae will be unable to successfully change from  pupae to adults.  This breaks the [[biological life cycle]] of the insect, preventing recurring infestation. Methoprene is used in the production of a number of foods, including meat, milk, mushrooms, peanuts, rice, and cereals. It also has several uses on domestic animals (pets) for controlling fleas. Methoprene is considered a biological pesticide because rather than controlling target pests through direct toxicity, methoprene interferes with an insect’s lifecycle and prevents it from reaching maturity or reproducing.<ref>{{ cite web | title = Insect Growth Regulators: S-Hydroprene (128966), S-Kinoprene (107502), Methoprene (105401), S-Methoprene (105402) Fact Sheet | publisher = [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] Office of Pesticide Programs | url = http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/chem_search/reg_actions/registration/fs_G-107_06-Dec-01.pdf }}</ref>

Methoprene is commonly used as a [[mosquito]] [[larvicide]] used to help stop the spread of the [[West Nile virus]].

Methoprene is also used as a food additive in cattle feed to prevent fly breeding in the manure.

The [[endocrine disruptor]] methoprene may be responsible for the death of [[lobster]]s.<ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Walker, A.
