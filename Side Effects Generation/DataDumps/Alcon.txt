== History ==
Alcon was founded in 1945<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.alcon.com/about-us/who-we-are/history|title= Improving Vision through Innovation Since 1945}}</ref> in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], [[United States|USA]].  The company started as a small [[pharmacy]] in Fort Worth and was named for its founders, [[pharmacist]]s Robert Alexander and William Conner.  Conner and Alexander focused on [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]] [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmic]] products.

[[Nestlé]] of [[Switzerland]] purchased Alcon in 1977.  Alcon expanded its manufacturing capability with new plants in South America and Europe and drastically increased its investment in research.  In 1979, Alcon acquired Texas Pharmacal Company which became Dermatological Products of Texas (and is now [[DPT Laboratories]]). In 1984, Alcon founded the Technical Excellence Award to promote achievements in R&D excellence and has awarded it to more than 100 recipients. The Alcon product line has expanded from [[pharmaceuticals]] to the surgical arena. Today, Alcon has operations in 75 countries and their products are sold in over 180 countries.

[[Nestlé]] conducted an initial public offering of 25% of its stake in Alcon in 2002. The stock is traded under the [[ticker symbol]] ACL. In July 2008, Novartis purchased approximately 25% of Nestlé's stake in Alcon, with an option to buy Nestlé's remaining shares beginning in 2010.<ref>[http://links.reuters.com/r/SCXS8/P81DY/JIQCHE/H9SK4/IOW2A/YT/h Reuters - Novartis announces offer to buy Nestlé's shares in Alcon] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Novartis bought 52% stake from Nestlé for $28.1 Billion. This deal brought the total ownership of Novartis to 77%. Beginning January 2010 Novartis formally announced it will be completing the exercise options for finishing purchasing the rest of Alcon and then promptly continue to exercise merger and takeover of Alcon.<ref name="scribd.com" /> On March 29, 2010, Alcon acquired Durezol and Zyclorin from Sirion Therapeutics. Alcon received regulatory approval to acquire the rights of Durezol emulsion in the US and the global rights, excluding Latin America, for Zyclorin from Sirion Therapeutics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100329006744/en/Alcon-Completes-Acquisition-DUREZOL%E2%84%A2-ZYCLORIN%E2%84%A2-Sirion|title=Alcon Completes Acquisition of DUREZOL™ and ZYCLORIN™ from Sirion|date=March 29, 2010|access-date=March 16, 2016|publisher=[[Business Wire]]}}</ref>

On June 28, 2010, Alcon's Independent Director Committee announced that a recommendation by the Committee was an indispensable first step before the board of the company can decide on the merger proposal of [[Novartis AG]], refuted Novartis’ public implications that it would be able to unilaterally impose the merger irrespective of the Independent Director Committee’s position once Novartis became Alcon’s majority shareholder. On July 8, 2010, Alcon's independent director committee (IDC) had set up a $50 million litigation trust to ensure company's minority shareholders get the best deal from bidder Novartis AG.<ref name="ceoworld">{{cite web|url=http://ceoworld.biz/ceo/2010/07/08/alcon-acl-sets-up-trust-for-litigation-between-with-novartis-to-protect-minorities |title=Alcon (ACL) Sets up trust for litigation between with Novartis to protect minorities |work=The Chief Executive Forum |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710193111/http://ceoworld.biz/ceo/2010/07/08/alcon-acl-sets-up-trust-for-litigation-between-with-novartis-to-protect-minorities |archivedate=2010-07-10 }}</ref>

In August 2010, Novartis acquired the remaining 52 percent of Alcon shares that Nestlé owned, completing the second step of the transaction to become Alcon’s majority owner.
