'''A-836,339''' is a drug developed by [[Abbott Laboratories]] that acts as a potent [[cannabinoid]] [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] [[full agonist]]. It is selective for [[Cannabinoid receptor 2|CB<sub>2</sub>]], with [[Dissociation constant#Protein-ligand binding|''K''<sub>i</sub>]] values of 0.64&nbsp;nM at CB<sub>2</sub> vs 270&nbsp;nM at the psychoactive [[Cannabinoid receptor 1|CB<sub>1</sub>]] receptor, but while it exhibits selective [[analgesic]], [[anti-inflammatory]] and [[hyperalgesia|anti-hyperalgesic]] effects at low doses,<ref>{{Cite journal |doi= 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.11.015 |pmid= 19063946 |year= 2009 |last= McGaraughty |first= S. |title= A CB(2) receptor agonist, A-836339, modulates wide dynamic range neuronal activity in neuropathic rats: contributions of spinal and peripheral CB(2) receptors |volume= 158 |issue= 4 |pages= 1652–1661 |journal= Neuroscience |display-authors=etal}}
