== Medical uses ==

Ivermectin is a broad-spectrum antiparasitic agent, traditionally against [[parasitic worm]]s and other multicellular  parasites. It is mainly used in humans in the treatment of [[onchocerciasis]] (river blindness), but is also effective against other worm infestations (such as [[strongyloidiasis]], [[ascariasis]], [[trichuriasis]], [[filariasis]] and [[enterobiasis]]), and some epidermal parasitic skin diseases, including [[scabies]].

Ivermectin is currently being used to help eliminate river blindness (onchocerciasis) in the [[Americas]], and to stop [[transmission (medicine)|transmission]] of [[lymphatic filariasis]] and onchocerciasis around the world in programs sponsored by the Carter Center using ivermectin donated by Merck.<ref name="RBP">{{cite web | author=The Carter Center | title=River Blindness (Onchocerciasis) Program | url=http://www.cartercenter.org/health/river_blindness/index.html | accessdate=July 17, 2008 | postscript=<!--None--> | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720091056/http://cartercenter.org/health/river_blindness/index.html | archivedate=July 20, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name="LFEP">{{cite web | author=The Carter Center | title=Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination Program | url=http://www.cartercenter.org/health/lf/index.html | accessdate=July 17, 2008 | postscript=<!--None--> | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720092050/http://cartercenter.org/health/lf/index.html | archivedate=July 20, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name="APOC">{{cite web | author=WHO | title=African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control | url=http://www.who.int/blindness/partnerships/APOC/en/ | accessdate=November 12, 2009 | postscript=<!--None--> | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922222045/http://www.who.int/blindness/partnerships/APOC/en/ | archivedate=September 22, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> The disease is common in 30 African countries, six Latin American countries, and Yemen.<ref name="UFAR">{{cite web|author=United Front Against Riverblindness |title=Onchocerciasis or Riverblindness |url=http://www.riverblindness.org/index.php?menu=tn2&page=aboutRiverblindness |postscript= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826234834/http://www.riverblindness.org/index.php?menu=tn2&page=aboutRiverblindness |archive-date=August 26, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> The drug rapidly kills microfilariae, but not the adult worms.

=== Rosacea ===

An ivermectin cream has been approved by the [[FDA]], as well as in Europe, for the treatment of inflammatory [[lesion]]s of [[rosacea]]. The treatment is based upon the hypothesis that parasitic mites of the genus ''[[Demodex]]'' play a role in rosacea. In a clinical study, ivermectin reduced lesions by 83% over 4 months, as compared to 74% under a [[metronidazole]] standard therapy.<ref>[http://www.drugs.com/newdrugs/galderma-receives-fda-approval-soolantra-ivermectin-cream-rosacea-4135.html Galderma Receives FDA Approval of Soolantra (Ivermectin) Cream for Rosacea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122021246/http://www.drugs.com/newdrugs/galderma-receives-fda-approval-soolantra-ivermectin-cream-rosacea-4135.html |date=January 22, 2015 }}"</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=b1d5b166-ab06-4ab5-b0c6-31126238118a|title=SOOLANTRA- ivermectin cream (NDC Code(s): 0299-3823-30, 0299-3823-45, 0299-3823-60)|website=DailyMed|date=December 2014|access-date=September 9, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160224120140/http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=b1d5b166-ab06-4ab5-b0c6-31126238118a|archivedate=February 24, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.galderma.com/News/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/79/Galderma-Announces-Positive-Outcome-of-European-Decentralised-Procedure-for-Approval-of-SOOLANTRA-ivermectin-Cream-10mgg-for-Rosacea-Patients|publisher=Galderma|title=Galderma Announces Positive Outcome of European Decentralised Procedure for Approval of Soolantra (ivermectin) Cream 10mg/g for Rosacea Patients|date=March 27, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305154203/http://www.galderma.com/News/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/79/Galderma-Announces-Positive-Outcome-of-European-Decentralised-Procedure-for-Approval-of-SOOLANTRA-ivermectin-Cream-10mgg-for-Rosacea-Patients|archivedate=March 5, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

== Side effects ==

The main concern is neurotoxicity, which in most mammalian species may manifest as [[central nervous system depression]], and consequent [[ataxia]], as might be expected from potentiation of inhibitory GABA-ergic synapses.

Dogs with defects in the P-glycoprotein gene (''MDR1''), often collie-like herding dogs, can be severely poisoned by ivermectin.

Since drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 enzymes often also inhibit P-glycoprotein transport, the risk of increased absorption past the blood-brain barrier exists when ivermectin is administered along with other CYP3A4 inhibitors. These drugs include statins, HIV protease inhibitors, many calcium channel blockers, and glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone, lidocaine, and the benzodiazepines.<ref>Goodman and Gilman's Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 11th edition, pages 122, 1084–1087.</ref>

For dogs, the insecticide [[spinosad]] may have the effect of increasing the potency of ivermectin.<ref>{{cite web|title=COMFORTIS® and ivermectin interaction Safety Warning Notification|url=http://www.fda.gov/animalveterinary/newsevents/cvmupdates/ucm047942.htm|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829064135/http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/NewsEvents/CVMUpdates/ucm047942.htm|archive-date=August 29, 2009}}</ref>

== Pharmacology ==

=== Pharmacodynamics ===

Ivermectin and other avermectins ([[insecticide]]s most frequently used in home-use [[ant]] baits) are [[cyclic compound|macrocyclic]] [[lactones]] derived from the [[bacterium]] ''[[Streptomyces avermitilis]]''. Ivermectin kills by interfering with [[nervous system]] and [[muscle]] function, in particular by enhancing inhibitory [[neurotransmission]].

The drug binds to glutamate-gated [[chloride channels]] (GluCls) in the membranes of [[invertebrate]] nerve and muscle cells, causing increased permeability to chloride ions, resulting in cellular hyper-polarization, followed by paralysis and death.<ref name=AHFS2016 /><ref name="pmid15313134">{{cite journal |vauthors=Yates DM, Wolstenholme AJ |title=An ivermectin-sensitive glutamate-gated chloride channel subunit from Dirofilaria immitis |journal=Int.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===

Ivermectin can be given either by mouth or injection. It does not readily cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] of [[mammal]]s due to the presence of [[P-glycoprotein]],<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Borst P, Schinkel AH | title = What have we learnt thus far from mice with disrupted P-glycoprotein genes?| journal = European Journal of Cancer| volume = 32| issue = 6| pages =985–990|date=June 1996| pmid =| doi = 10.1016/0959-8049(96)00063-9}}</ref> (the ''MDR1'' gene mutation affects function of this protein). Crossing may still become significant if ivermectin is given at high doses (in which case, brain levels peak 2–5 hr after administration).
In contrast to mammals, ivermectin can cross the blood–brain barrier in tortoises, often with fatal consequences.

=== Ecotoxicity ===

Field studies have demonstrated the dung of animals treated with ivermectin supports a significantly reduced diversity of invertebrates, and the dung persists longer.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Iglesias LE, Saumell CA, Fernández AS, etal | title = Environmental impact of ivermectin excreted by cattle treated in autumn on dung fauna and degradation of faeces on pasture| journal = Parasitology Research| volume = 100| issue = 1| pages = 93–102|date=December 2006| pmid = 16821034| doi = 10.1007/s00436-006-0240-x}}</ref>

== History ==

The discovery of the [[avermectin]] family of compounds, from which ivermectin is chemically derived, was made by [[Satoshi Ōmura]] of Kitasato University, Tokyo and [[William C. Campbell (scientist)|William C. Campbell]] of the Merck Institute for Therapeutic research. Ōmura identified avermectin from the bacterium ''[[Streptomyces avermitilis]]''. Campbell purified avermectin from cultures obtained from Ōmura and led efforts leading to the discovery of ivermectin, a derivative of greater potency and lower toxicity.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fisher MH, Mrozik H |title=The chemistry and pharmacology of avermectins |journal=Annu.

== Veterinary use ==

In veterinary medicine ivermectin is used against many intestinal worms (but not tapeworms), most mites, and some lice. Despite this, it is not effective for eliminating ticks, flies, flukes, or fleas. Eggs and larvae mature and come back to the host. It is effective against larval heartworms, but not against adult heartworms, though it may shorten their lives. The dose of the medicine must be very accurately measured as it is very toxic in over-dosage. It is sometimes administered in combination with other medications to treat a broad spectrum of animal parasites. Some dog breeds (especially the [[Rough Collie]], the [[Smooth Collie]], the [[Shetland Sheepdog]], and the [[Australian Shepherd]]), though, have a high incidence of a certain mutation within the ''[[MDR1]]'' gene (coding for [[P-glycoprotein]]); affected animals are particularly sensitive to the toxic effects of ivermectin.<ref>[http://www.ashgi.org/articles/mdr1.htm "MDR1 FAQs"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213125320/http://www.ashgi.org/articles/mdr1.htm |date=December 13, 2007 }}, Australian Shepherd Health & Genetics Institute, Inc.</ref><ref>[http://vcpl.vetmed.wsu.edu/vcpl-home "Multidrug Sensitivity in Dogs"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623212433/http://vcpl.vetmed.wsu.edu/vcpl-home |date=June 23, 2015 }}, Washington State University's College of Veterinary Medicine</ref> Clinical evidence suggests kittens are susceptible to ivermectin toxicity.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Frischke H, Hunt L | title = Suspected ivermectin toxicity| journal = Canadian Veterinary Journal| volume = 32| issue = 4| page = 245|date=April 1991| doi =| pmc=1481314| pmid=17423775}}</ref> A 0.01% ivermectin topical preparation for treating [[ear mite]]s in cats (Acarexx) is available.

Ivermectin is sometimes used as an [[acaricide]] in reptiles, both by injection and as a diluted spray. While this works well in some cases, care must be taken, as several species of reptiles are very sensitive to ivermectin. Use in turtles is particularly contraindicated.

== Research ==

Ivermectin is also being studied as a potential antiviral agent against the viruses [[chikungunya]] and [[yellow fever]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Varghese FS | date = Feb 2016 | title = Discovery of berberine, abamectin and ivermectin as antivirals against chikungunya and other alphaviruses | url = | journal = Antiviral Res | volume = 126 | issue = | pages = 117–24 | doi = 10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.12.012 | pmid = 26752081 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>

A 2012 [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane review]] found weak evidence suggesting that ivermectin could result in the reduction of chorioretinal lesions and prevent loss of vision in people with [[onchocerciasis]].<ref name="Ejere">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ejere HO, Schwartz E, Wormald R, Evans JR |title= Ivermectin for onchocercal eye disease (river blindness) |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=8 |issue= 8 |pages= CD002219 |date=2012 |pmid= 22895928|doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD002219.pub2 |pmc=4425412}}</ref>
