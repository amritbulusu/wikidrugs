HSDD was recognized as a distinct sexual function disorder for more than 30 years, but was removed from the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] in 2013, and replaced with a new diagnosis called [[female sexual arousal disorder|female sexual interest/arousal disorder]] (FSIAD).<ref>American Psychiatric Association.

==Medical uses==
Flibanserin is used for [[hypoactive sexual desire disorder]] among women. Those receiving flibanserin report a 0.5 increase compared to placebo in the number of times they had “satisfying sexual events”.<ref name=JAMA2016/> In those on flibanserin it rose from 2.8 to 4.5 times a month while women receiving placebo reported also an increase of “satisfying sexual events” from 2.7 to 3.7 times a month.<ref>Jolly E, Thorp J, Clayton AH, et al.

The effectiveness of flibanserin was evaluated in three phase 3 clinical trials. Each of the three trials had two co-primary endpoints, one for satisfying sexual events (SSEs) and the other for sexual desire. Each of the 3 trials also had a secondary endpoint that measured distress related to sexual desire. All three trials showed that flibanserin produced an increase in the number of SSEs and reduced distress related to sexual desire. The first two trials used an electronic diary to measure sexual desire, and did not find an increase. These two trials also measured sexual desire using the Female Sexual Function index (FSFI) as a secondary endpoint, and an increase was observed using this latter measure. The FSFI was used as the co-primary endpoint for sexual desire in the third trial, and again showed a statistically significant increase.<ref name="PrescribingInfo" />

==Side effects==
[[adverse effect|Adverse event]]s are more common among women taking flibanserin. The majority of adverse events were mild to moderate. The most commonly reported adverse events included [[dizziness]], [[nausea]], [[Fatigue (medical)|feeling tired]], [[somnolence|sleepiness]], and [[insomnia|trouble sleeping]].<ref name=UCM215437>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/ReproductiveHealthDrugsAdvisoryCommittee/UCM215437.pdf |format=PDF |title=Proposed Indication: Flibanserin is indicated for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in premenopausal women |date=May 20, 2010 |accessdate=June 16, 2010}}</ref>

The proposed [[mechanism of action]] refers to the Kinsey dual control model of [[sexual arousal|sexual response]].<ref>Janssen, E, Bancroft J.

The balance between these systems is of significance for a normal sexual response. By modulating serotonin and dopamine activity in certain parts of the brain, flibanserin may improve the balance between these neurotransmitter systems in the regulation of sexual response.<ref name=Pfaus09>{{cite journal |author=Pfaus JG |title=Pathways of sexual desire |journal=J Sex Med |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=1506–33 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19453889 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2009.01309.x}}</ref><ref name=Allers10>{{cite journal |vauthors=Allers K, Dremencov E, Ceci A |title=Acute and repeated flibanserin administration in female rats modulates monoamines differentially across brain areas: a microdialysis study |journal=J Sex Med |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=1757–67 |pmid=20163532 |date=May 2010 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.01763.x |display-authors=etal}}</ref>

Former proposed but abandoned trade names of flibanserin include Ectris and Girosa, and its former developmental code name was BIMT-17.
Current brand name is Addyi

===Approval process and advocacy===
On June 18, 2010, a federal advisory panel to the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) unanimously voted against recommending approval of flibanserin, citing an inadequate risk-benefit ratio. The Committee acknowledged the validity of hypoactive sexual desire as a  diagnosis, but expressed concern with the drug's side effects and insufficient evidence for efficacy, especially the drug's failure to show a statistically significant effect on the co-primary endpoint of sexual desire.<ref>{{citation |contribution=June 18, 2010 meeting of the FDA Advisory Committee for Reproductive Health Drugs |title=Minutes |contribution-url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/ReproductiveHealthDrugsAdvisoryCommittee/UCM248751.pdf |accessdate=2015-11-18 }}</ref> Earlier in the week, a FDA staff report also recommended non-approval of the drug. Ahead of the votes, Boehringer Ingelheim had mounted a publicity campaign to promote the controversial disorder of "hypoactive sexual desire".<ref>{{Cite news |title = Drug for sexual desire disorder opposed by panel|newspaper = [[New York Times]]|date = 18 June 2010|postscript = <!--None-->|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/19/business/19sexpill.html}}</ref> In 2010 the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter, stating that [[New Drug Application]]  could not be approved in its current form.  The letter cited several concerns, including the failure to demonstrate a statistical effect on the co-primary endpoint of sexual desire and overly restrictive entry criteria for the two Phase 3 trials. The Agency recommended performing a new Phase 3 trial with less restrictive entry criteria.<ref name="BRUDAC">{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/DrugSafetyandRiskManagementAdvisoryCommittee/UCM449088.pdf |title=Joint Meeting of the Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Drugs Advisory Committee (BRUDAC) and the Drug Safety and Risk Management (DSaRM) Advisory Committee |accessdate=}}</ref> On October 8, 2010, Boehringer announced that it would discontinue its development of flibanserin in light of the FDA's decision.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6970TN20101008 | work=Reuters | first=Ludwig | last=Burger | title=Boehringer pulls the plug on "pink Viagra" | date=8 October 2010}}</ref>

These include two studies in healthy subjects to determine if flibanserin impairs their ability to drive, and to determine if it interferes with other biochemical pathways.

The approval was opposed by the [[National Women's Health Network]], the [[National Center for Health Research]] and [[Our Bodies Ourselves]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article31116701.html |title=Raleigh’s Sprout Pharmaceuticals awaits FDA ruling on female libido drug &#124; News & Observer |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> A representative of [[PharmedOut]] said "To approve this drug will set the worst kind of precedent — that companies that spend enough money can force the FDA to approve useless or dangerous drugs."<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.minnpost.com/second-opinion/2015/06/faux-advocacy-not-science-prompted-fda-panels-ok-low-libido-drug-women-critic |title='Faux-advocacy,' not science, prompted FDA panel's OK of 'low libido' drug for women, critics charge |first=Susan |last=Perry |work=minnpost.com |date=8 June 2015 |accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref> An editorial in [[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] noted that " Although flibanserin is not the first product to be supported by a consumer advocacy group in turn supported by pharmaceutical manufacturers, claims of gender bias regarding the FDA’s regulation have been particularly noteworthy, as have the extent of advocacy efforts ranging from social media campaigns to letters from members of Congress".<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gellad WF, Flynn KE, Alexander GC |title=Evaluation of Flibanserin: Science and Advocacy at the FDA |journal=JAMA |volume=314 |issue=9 |pages=869–70 |year=2015 |pmid=26148201 |doi=10.1001/jama.2015.8405 |url=}}</ref>

==Reception==
The initial response since the 2015 introduction of flibanserin to the U.S. market was slow with 227 prescriptions written during the first three weeks.<ref name=bb>{{cite web| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-17/valeant-s-newest-problem-the-female-libido-pill-isn-t-selling|author1=Anna Edney |author2=Laura Colbey | title=The Female Libido Pill Is No Viagra |publisher=[[Bloomberg Business]]| date=November 17, 2015 |accessdate=November 18, 2015}}</ref> The slow response may be related to a number of factors: physicians require an about 10 minute online training to get certified, women are not allowed to drink alcohol, the medication has to be taken daily and is costly, about US$800 per month, and questions about the drug's efficacy and need.<ref name=bb/> Prescriptions for the drug continue to be few  with less than 4,000 being made as of February 2016. <ref>{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Katie|title=The Female Viagra, Undone by a Drug Maker’s Dysfunction|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/business/female-viagra-addyi-valeant-dysfunction.html?_r=1|accessdate=9 April 2016|publisher=The New York Times}}</ref>
