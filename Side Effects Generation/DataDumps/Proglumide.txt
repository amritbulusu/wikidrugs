'''Proglumide''' ('''Milid''') is a [[drug]] that inhibits [[gastrointestinal]] [[motility]] and reduces [[gastric secretion]]s. It acts as a [[cholecystokinin antagonist]],<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 2862828 | year = 1985 | last1 = Bunney | first1 = BS | last2 = Chiodo | first2 = LA | last3 = Freeman | first3 = AS | title = Further studies on the specificity of proglumide as a selective cholecystokinin antagonist in the central nervous system | volume = 448 | pages = 345–51 | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1985.tb29929.x}}</ref> which blocks both the [[Cholecystokinin A receptor|CCK<sub>A</sub>]] and [[Cholecystokinin B receptor|CCK<sub>B</sub>]] subtypes.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-079X.2005.00239.x | title = Selective CCK-A but not CCK-B receptor antagonists inhibit HT-29 cell proliferation: Synergism with pharmacological levels of melatonin | year = 2005 | last1 = Gonzalez-Puga | first1 = Cristina | last2 = Garcia-Navarro | first2 = Ana | last3 = Escames | first3 = Germaine | last4 = Leon | first4 = Josefa | last5 = Lopez-Cantarero | first5 = Manuel | last6 = Ros | first6 = Eduardo | last7 = Acuna-Castroviejo | first7 = Dario | journal = Journal of Pineal Research | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 243–50 | pmid = 16150104}}</ref> It was used mainly in the treatment of [[stomach ulcers]],<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 7231338 | year = 1981 | last1 = Bergemann | first1 = W | last2 = Consentius | first2 = K | last3 = Braun | first3 = HE | last4 = Hirschmann | first4 = H | last5 = Marowski | first5 = B | last6 = Munck | first6 = A | last7 = Rehs | first7 = HU | last8 = Stopik | first8 = D | last9 = Wilke | first9 = G | title = Duodenal ulcer - multicenter double-blind study with proglumide | volume = 76 | issue = 8 | pages = 226–9 | journal = Medizinische Klinik }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 3572816 | year = 1987 | last1 = Tariq | first1 = M | last2 = Parmar | first2 = NS | last3 = Ageel | first3 = AM | title = Gastric and duodenal antiulcer and cytoprotective effects of proglumide in rats | volume = 241 | issue = 2 | pages = 602–7 | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics}}</ref> although it has now been largely replaced by newer drugs for this application.

An interesting side effect of proglumide is that it enhances the [[analgesia]] produced by [[opioid]] drugs,<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 12792559 | year = 2003 | last1 = McCleane | first1 = GJ | title = The cholecystokinin antagonist proglumide enhances the analgesic effect of dihydrocodeine | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 200–1 | journal = The Clinical journal of pain | doi=10.1097/00002508-200305000-00008}}</ref> and can prevent or even reverse the development of [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]] to opioid drugs.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 6546809 | year = 1984 | last1 = Watkins | first1 = LR | last2 = Kinscheck | first2 = IB | last3 = Mayer | first3 = DJ | title = Potentiation of opiate analgesia and apparent reversal of morphine tolerance by proglumide | volume = 224 | issue = 4647 | pages = 395–6 | journal = Science | doi=10.1126/science.6546809}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 6462377 | year = 1984 | last1 = Tang | first1 = J | last2 = Chou | first2 = J | last3 = Iadarola | first3 = M | last4 = Yang | first4 = HY | last5 = Costa | first5 = E | title = Proglumide prevents and curtails acute tolerance to morphine in rats | volume = 23 | issue = 6 | pages = 715–8 | journal = Neuropharmacology | doi=10.1016/0028-3908(84)90171-0}}</ref> This can make it a useful [[adjuvant]] treatment to use alongside opioid drugs in the treatment of chronic pain conditions such as cancer, where opioid analgesics may be required for long periods and development of tolerance reduces clinical efficacy of these drugs.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 9654837 | year = 1998 | last1 = Bernstein | first1 = ZP | last2 = Yucht | first2 = S | last3 = Battista | first3 = E | last4 = Lema | first4 = M | last5 = Spaulding | first5 = MB | title = Proglumide as a morphine adjunct in cancer pain management | volume = 15 | issue = 5 | pages = 314–20 | journal = Journal of pain and symptom management | doi=10.1016/s0885-3924(98)00003-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 9806692 | year = 1998 | last1 = McCleane | first1 = GJ | title = The cholecystokinin antagonist proglumide enhances the analgesic efficacy of morphine in humans with chronic benign pain | volume = 87 | issue = 5 | pages = 1117–20 | journal = Anesthesia and Analgesia | doi=10.1213/00000539-199811000-00025}}</ref>

Proglumide has also been shown to act as a [[delta Opioid receptor|δ-opioid]] agonist, which may contribute to its analgesic effects.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 3030338 | year = 1987 | last1 = Rezvani | first1 = A | last2 = Stokes | first2 = KB | last3 = Rhoads | first3 = DL | last4 = Way | first4 = EL | title = Proglumide exhibits delta opioid agonist properties | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 135–46 | journal = Alcohol and drug research}}</ref>

Proglumide also works as a placebo effect amplifier for pain conditions. When injected visibly to a subject, its analgesic effect is bigger than a similarly administered placebo. When injected secretly, it does not have any effect, whereas standard pain drugs have an effect, even if they are administered without the subject's awareness.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 7475687 | year = 1995 | last1 = Benedetti | first1 = F | last2 = Amanzio | first2 = M | last3 = Maggi | first3 = G | title = Potentiation of placebo analgesia by proglumide | volume = 346 | issue = 8984 | pages = 1231 | journal = Lancet | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(95)92938-X}}</ref> The supposed mechanism is an enhancement of the neural pathways of expectation as a result of dopamine and endogenous opioids being suddenly released throughout numerous structures of the brain and spinal cord. 

The [[ventral tegmental area]] is the structure believed to mediate proglumides analgesic and euphoric effects, however dozens of areas with a wide range of physical and psychological functions are implicated in the mediation of the placebo effect (this accounts for proglumides ability to produce physically measurable effects on [[vital signs]] such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiration rate, and [[tidal volume]] which can not be accounted for by its clinically insignificant δ-opioid affinity.
