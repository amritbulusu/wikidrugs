'''2C-T-2''' is a [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] and [[empathogen-entactogen|entactogenic]] [[phenethylamine]] of the [[2C (psychedelics)|2C family]]. It was first synthesized in 1981 by [[Alexander Shulgin]], and rated by him as one of the "magical half-dozen" most important psychedelic phenethylamine compounds.<ref name="Theobald">{{cite journal| last =Theobald| first =DS|author2=R Staack|author3=M Puetz|author4=HH Mauer| title =New designer drug 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylthio-β-phenethylamine (2C-T-2): studies on its metabolism and toxicological detection in rat urine using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry| journal =[[Journal of Mass Spectrometry]]| volume =40| issue =9| pages =1157–1172 | url =| doi =10.1002/jms.890| pmid =16041763 |date=September  2005}}</ref>  The drug has structural and pharmacodynamic properties similar to those of [[2C-T-7]] ("Blue Mystic").

==Dosage==

In [[Alexander Shulgin]]'s book ''[[PiHKAL]]'', the dosage range is listed as 12 to 25&nbsp;mg.  According to [[Erowid]] a threshold dose would be 5&nbsp;mg, a light dose would range from 8–15&nbsp;mg, a common dose is 15–22&nbsp;mg and a strong dose would be considered to be 20–40&nbsp;mg.

==Effects==

Effects are similar to the related [[2C-T-7]], but 2C-T-2 is said to produce more of a [[body load]] and other reactions which can be unpleasant, reported effects being reddening of the face and warm flushes. It can also be very nauseating while coming up, some users report a period of restlessness during the come up and feeling cold.  There have been no reported deaths from 2C-T-2, unlike 2C-T-7, and the psychedelic effects have been much milder. The onset usually starts after an hour of ingestion and rises for about two hours until the user hits the plateau. Insufflated doses reach a peak much faster and have been compared to the effect of [[ketamine]] on the body.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

[[Hallucinations]] similar to those created by [[LSD]] and other [[serotonergic psychedelic]]s are very prominent on typical 2C-T-2 doses. The trip is often described as being similar to LSD due to the serotonergic effects and hallucinations. Some users describe "beautiful" visuals, similar to 2C-T-7, which has coined its street name "Rosy". In some aspects the effect is similar to other [[phenethylamines]] like [[MDMA]] (users sometimes have [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoric]] rushes); however, unlike MDMA, 2C-T-2 is a strong psychedelic, and its effects can be unpredictable, even for "experienced" users.

2C-T-2 can be just as powerful as LSD and other hallucinogens. Due to the particular body load effect of this substance, it is significantly different from most popular hallucinogens though it is still capable of producing a [[bad trip]]. Effects can last up to 16 hours from dosing.

When insufflated, 2C-T-2 can give rise to an instant come-up that is intense and possibly nauseating, with intense visuals manifesting within approximately 2 minutes. Common effects include waves of euphoria, laughing fits, and geometric patterns through to full-on hallucinations, lasting roughly 5–6 hours.

==Pharmacology==

The [[mechanism of action]] that produces 2C-T-2’s hallucinogenic and entheogenic effects has not been specifically established, however it is most likely to result from action as a [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]] [[5-HT receptor|serotonin receptor]] [[agonist]] in the brain, a mechanism of action shared by all of the hallucinogenic tryptamines and phenethylamines for which the mechanism of action is known.

==Dangers==

There are no known reports of [[neurotoxicity]], but very little scientific knowledge exists for 2C-T-2.

All confirmed fatalities involving 2C-T drugs involve high dosages taken by the nasal route, or dangerous combinations with stimulant and depressant drugs such as [[Alcohol]], [[MDMA]] and [[Cocaine]].

===Netherlands===
The Netherlands became the first country in the world to ban 2C-T-2, and classify it as a hard drug, by law. In April, 1999, 2C-T-2 became a list I drug of the [[Opium Law]].

===Sweden===
Schedule I in Sweden.

2C-T-2 was first classified as "health hazard" under the act [[:sv:Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor|''Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor'']] (translated ''Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health'') as of April 1, 1999, under '''SFS 1999:58'''<ref>http://www.notisum.se/rnp/sls/fakta/a9990058.HTM</ref> that made it illegal to sell or possess.

[[Riksdag|The Riksdag]] added 2C-T-2 to [[:sv:Narkotikastrafflagen|Narcotic Drugs Punishments Act]] under ''Swedish schedule I'' (''"substances, plant materials and fungi which normally do not have medical use"'') as of March 16, 2004, published by [[Medical Products Agency (Sweden)|Medical Products Agency (MPA)]] in regulation ''LVFS 2004:3'' listed as '''2C-T-2, 2,5-dimetoxi-4-etyltiofenetylamin'''.<ref>https://lakemedelsverket.se/upload/lvfs/LVFS_2004-3.pdf</ref>

===UK===
2C-T-2 and all other compounds featured in [[PiHKAL]] are illegal drugs in the [[United Kingdom]].

===USA===
2C-T-2 is specifically listed as a schedule I substance under SEC. 1152 of S.3187: [[Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012]].

===Australia===
2C-T-2 is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the [[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons|Poisons Standard]] (October 2015).<ref name="Poisons Standard">Poisons Standard October 2015 https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2015L01534</ref> A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.<ref name="Poisons Standard" />
