===Psychoactive ingredients===
According to the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC), "the amount of THC present in a cannabis sample is generally used as a measure of cannabis potency."<ref name="Why Does Cannabis Potency Matter?">{{Cite journal |url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/2009/June/why-does-cannabis-potency-matter.html |title=Why Does Cannabis Potency Matter? |date=2009-06-29 |publisher=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime}}</ref> The three main forms of cannabis products are the flower, resin (hashish), and oil (hash oil). The UNODC states that cannabis often contains 5% THC content, resin "can contain up to 20% THC content", and that "Cannabis oil may contain more than 60% THC content."<ref name="Why Does Cannabis Potency Matter?" />

A 2012 review found that the THC content in marijuana had increased worldwide from 1970 to 2009.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cascini|first1=F|last2=Aiello|first2=C|last3=Di Tanna|first3=G|title=Increasing delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ-9-THC) content in herbal cannabis over time: systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=Current drug abuse reviews|date=March 2012|volume=5|issue=1|pages=32–40|pmid=22150622|doi=10.2174/1874473711205010032}}</ref> It is unclear, however, whether the increase in THC content has caused people to consume more THC or if users adjust based on the potency of the cannabis. It is likely that the higher THC content allows people to ingest less tar. At the same time, CBD levels in seized samples have lowered, in part because of the desire to produce higher THC levels and because more illegal growers cultivate indoors using artificial lights. This helps avoid detection but reduces the CBD production of the plant.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2014/jan/17/cannabis-memory-loss-cbd|title=Cannabis and memory loss: dude, where's my CBD?|author=Dana Smith|work=the Guardian}}</ref>

[[John Gregory Bourke]] described the use of "mariguan", which he identifies as ''Cannabis indica'' or Indian hemp, by Mexican residents of the [[Rio Grande]] region of [[Texas]] in 1894. He described its uses for treatment of asthma, to expedite delivery, to keep away witches, and as a love-philtre. He also wrote that many Mexicans added the herb to their cigarritos or [[Mezcal|mescal]], often taking a bite of sugar afterward to intensify the effect. Bourke wrote that because it was often used in a mixture with [[toloachi]] (which he inaccurately describes as ''[[Datura stramonium]]''), mariguan was one of the several plants known as "[[loco weed]]". Bourke compared mariguan to hasheesh, which he called "one of the greatest curses of the East", citing reports that users "become maniacs and are apt to commit all sorts of acts of violence and murder", causing degeneration of the body and an idiotic appearance, and mentioned laws against sale of hasheesh "in most Eastern countries".<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KQMpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA138|title=Popular medicine, customs, and superstitions of the Rio Grande|author=John G.

It also required parties to "exercise an effective control of such a nature as to prevent the illicit international traffic in Indian hemp and especially in the resin".<ref>{{Cite journal |url= http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/history/e1920/willoughby.htm |author=W.

Many jurisdictions have lessened the penalties for possession of small quantities of cannabis so that it is punished by confiscation and sometimes a fine, rather than imprisonment, focusing more on those who traffic the drug on the [[black market]].

In some areas where cannabis use has been historically tolerated, some new restrictions have been put in place, such as the closing of [[cannabis coffee shop]]s near the borders of the Netherlands,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.expatica.com/nl/leisure/arts_culture/many-dutch-coffee-shops-close-as-liberal-policies-change-46376.html |title=Many Dutch coffee shops close as liberal policies change, Exaptica |date=2007-11-27 |publisher=Expatica.com |accessdate=2010-09-20}}</ref> closing of coffee shops near secondary schools in the Netherlands and crackdowns on "Pusher Street" in [[Freetown Christiania|Christiania]], Copenhagen in 2004.<ref>[http://www.writsdc.com/make-cannabis-oil/ EMCDDA Cannabis reader]: Global issues and local experiences, Perspectives on Cannabis controversies, treatment and regulation in Europe, 2008, p. 157.</ref><ref>[http://www.rnw.nl/internationaljustice/news/international/6061587/43-Amsterdam-coffee-shops-to-close-doors "43 Amsterdam coffee shops to close door"], Radio Netherlands, Friday 21 November 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202130012/http://www.rnw.nl/internationaljustice/news/international/6061587/43-Amsterdam-coffee-shops-to-close-doors |date=December 2, 2008 }}</ref>

Some jurisdictions use free voluntary treatment programs and/or mandatory treatment programs for frequent known users. Simple possession can carry long prison terms in some countries, particularly in East Asia, where the sale of cannabis may lead to a sentence of life in prison or even execution. More recently, however, many political parties, non-profit organizations, and causes based on the legalization of medical cannabis and/or legalizing the plant entirely (with some restrictions) have emerged.

====Production====
{{Main article|Cannabis cultivation}}
<!-- PLEASE, do not add more detail to this section, contributions are more than welcome at [[Cannabis (drug) cultivation]]. THANKS. -->

It is often claimed by growers and breeders of herbal cannabis that advances in breeding and cultivation techniques have increased the potency of cannabis since the late 1960s and early '70s when THC was first discovered and understood. However, potent seedless cannabis such as "[[Thai sticks]]" were already available at that time. ''Sinsemilla'' (Spanish for "without seed") is the dried, seedless inflorescences of female cannabis plants. Because THC production drops off once pollination occurs, the male plants (which produce little THC themselves) are eliminated before they shed pollen to prevent pollination. Advanced cultivation techniques such as [[Cannabis (drug) cultivation#Hydroponic cultivation|hydroponics]], [[Cannabis (drug) cultivation#Feminized seeds|cloning]], [[Cannabis (drug) cultivation#Light|high-intensity artificial lighting]], and [[Cannabis (drug) cultivation#SOG|the sea of green method]] are frequently employed as a response (in part) to prohibition enforcement efforts that make outdoor cultivation more risky. It is often cited that the average levels of THC in cannabis sold in the United States rose dramatically between the 1970s and 2000, but such statements are likely skewed because undue weight is given to much more expensive and potent, but less prevalent samples.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2074151 |publisher=Slate.com |title=The Myth of Potent Pot |author=Daniel Forbes |date=2002-11-19}}</ref>

{{anchor|Skunk}}
"Skunk" refers to several named strains of potent cannabis, grown through selective breeding and sometimes [[hydroponics]]. It is a cross-breed of ''Cannabis sativa'' and ''C. indica'' (although other strains of this mix exist in abundance). Skunk cannabis potency ranges usually from 6% to 15% and rarely as high as 20%. The average THC level in [[Cannabis coffee shop|coffee shops]] in the Netherlands is about 18–19%.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/WDR-2006.html |title=World Drug Report 2006 |publisher=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime}} Ch. 2.3.</ref>

====Price====

===Gateway drug===
{{main article|Gateway drug theory}}

The Gateway Hypothesis states that cannabis use increases the probability of trying "harder" drugs. The hypothesis has been hotly debated as it is regarded by some as the primary rationale for the United States prohibition on cannabis use.<ref name="Rand">{{Cite journal |date=2002-12-02 |url=https://www.rand.org/news/press.02/gateway.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104124529/https://www.rand.org/news/press.02/gateway.html |archivedate=2006-11-04 |title=RAND study casts doubt on claims that marijuana acts as "gateway" to the use of cocaine and heroin|publisher=RAND Corporation}}</ref><ref name="Benavie2009x">{{cite book|author=Arthur Benavie (University of North Carolina)|title=Drugs: America's Holy War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DQxXDgLnKD8C&pg=PA90|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-7890-3840-1|pages=90–}}</ref> A Pew Research Center poll found that political opposition to marijuana use was significantly associated with concerns about health effects and whether legalization would increase marijuana use by children.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.people-press.org/2014/04/02/section-2-views-of-marijuana-legalization-decriminalization-concerns/ |title=Public Views of Marijuana – Legalization, Decriminalization, Concerns &#124; Pew Research Center for the People and the Press |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

The gateway effect may appear due to social factors involved in using any illegal drug. Because of the illegal status of cannabis, its consumers are likely to find themselves in situations allowing them to acquaint with individuals using or selling other illegal drugs.<ref name="morral2002">{{cite journal |vauthors=Morral AR, McCaffrey DF, Paddock SM |title=Reassessing the marijuana gateway effect |journal=[[Addiction (journal)|Addiction]] |volume=97 |issue=12 |pages=1493–504 |year=2002 |pmid=12472629 |doi=10.1046/j.1360-0443.2002.00280.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mpp.org/about/faq.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622204803/http://www.mpp.org/about/faq.html|archivedate=2008-06-22|title=Marijuana Policy Project – FAQ}}</ref> Utilizing this argument some studies have shown that alcohol and tobacco may additionally be regarded as gateway drugs;<ref name="pmid8246462">{{cite journal |vauthors=Torabi MR, Bailey WJ, Majd-Jabbari M |title=Cigarette Smoking as a Predictor of Alcohol and Other Drug Use by Children and Adolescents: Evidence of the "Gateway Drug Effect" |journal=[[Journal of School Health]] |volume=63 |issue=7 |pages=302–6 |year=1993 |pmid=8246462 |doi=10.1111/j.1746-1561.1993.tb06150.x}}</ref> however, a more parsimonious explanation could be that cannabis is simply more readily available (and at an earlier age) than illegal hard drugs. In turn alcohol and tobacco are easier to obtain at an earlier point than is cannabis (though the reverse may be true in some areas), thus leading to the "gateway sequence" in those individuals since they are most likely to experiment with any drug offered.<ref name="Rand" />

An alternative to the gateway hypothesis is the common liability to addiction (CLA) theory. It states that some individuals are, for various reasons, willing to try multiple recreational substances. The "gateway" drugs are merely those that are (usually) available at an earlier age than the harder drugs. Researchers have noted in an extensive review, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3600369/ Vanyukov et al.], that it is dangerous to present the sequence of events described in gateway "theory" in causative terms as this hinders both research and intervention.<ref name=Vanyukov2012>{{cite journal |vauthors=Vanyukov MM, Tarter RE, Kirillova GP |title=Common liability to addiction and 'gateway hypothesis': theoretical, empirical and evolutionary perspective |journal=Drug Alcohol Depend |volume=123 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=S3–17 |date=June 2012 |pmid=22261179 |pmc=3600369 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2011.12.018 |type=Review|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

There are also other difficulties in researching the effects of cannabis.
