=== Other uses ===
Phenobarbital properties can effectively reduce tremors and seizures associated with abrupt withdrawal from benzodiazepines.

Phenobarbital is a [[cytochrome P450]] inducer, and is used to reduce the toxicity of some drugs.

Phenobarbital is occasionally prescribed in low doses to aid in the conjugation of [[bilirubin]] in people with [[Crigler-Najjar syndrome]] (Type II),<ref>{{Cite book|title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 19th edition|last=Kasper|first=Dennis|publisher=Mc Graw Hill|year=|isbn=978-0071802154|location=|pages=2002|quote=Bilirubin concentrations during phenobarbital administration do not return to normal but are typically in the range of 51-86 µmol/L (3-5 mg/dL).

For this reason, phenobarbital therapy is highly recommended, a single bedtime dose often sufficing to maintain clinically safe serum bilirubin concentrations.|via=}}</ref> or in patients with [[Gilbert syndrome]] {{citation needed|date=May 2016}}.

Phenobarbital can also be used to relieve [[cyclic vomiting syndrome]] symptoms.

Phenobarbital is a commonly used agent in high purity and dosage for lethal injection of "death row" criminals.

In infants suspected of neonatal biliary atresia, phenobarbital is used in preparation for a <sup>99m</sup>Tc-IDA hepatobiliary study that differentiates atresia from hepatitis or cholestasis.

Phenobarbital is used as a secondary agent to treat newborns with [[neonatal abstinence syndrome]], a condition of withdrawal symptoms from exposure to opioid drugs in utero.

In massive doses, phenobarbital is prescribed to terminally ill patients to allow them to end their life through [[Physician-assisted suicide|physician assisted suicide]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.doh.wa.gov/portals/1/Documents/Pubs/422-109-DeathWithDignityAct2015.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215140943/http://www.doh.wa.gov/portals/1/Documents/Pubs/422-109-DeathWithDignityAct2015.pdf |archivedate=2017-02-15 |df= }}</ref>

== Side effects ==
Sedation and hypnosis are the principal side effects (occasionally, they are also the intended effects) of phenobarbital. [[Central nervous system]] effects, such as dizziness, [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]] and [[ataxia]], are also common. In elderly patients, it may cause excitement  and confusion, while in children, it may result in [[paradoxical reaction|paradoxical hyperactivity]]. Another very rare side effect is [[amelogenesis imperfecta]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Phenobarbital is a [[cytochrome P450]] hepatic enzyme inducer. Drugs that are metabolized by the CYP450 enzyme system will decrease effectiveness because of faster clearance from the system.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Caution is to be used with children.

== Contraindications ==
[[Acute intermittent porphyria]], hypersensitivity to any barbiturate, prior dependence on barbiturates, severe respiratory insufficiency and [[hyperkinesia]] in children are contraindications for phenobarbital use.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

== Overdose ==
{{Main article|Barbiturate overdose}}

Phenobarbital causes a depression of the body's systems, mainly the [[central nervous system|central]] and [[peripheral nervous system]]s. Thus, the main characteristic of phenobarbital overdose is a "slowing" of bodily functions, including decreased [[consciousness]] (even [[coma]]), [[bradycardia]], [[bradypnea]], [[hypothermia]], and [[hypotension]] (in massive overdoses). Overdose may also lead to [[pulmonary edema]] and [[acute renal failure]] as a result of [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], and can result in death.

The [[electroencephalogram]] of a person with phenobarbital overdose may show a marked decrease in electrical activity, to the point of mimicking [[brain death]]. This is due to profound depression of the central nervous system, and is usually reversible.<ref name="Habal">{{cite web| url = http://www.emedicine.com/MED/topic207.htm| title = Barbiturate Toxicity| accessdate = 2006-09-14| author = Rania Habal| date = 2006-01-27| work = eMedicine| publisher = WebMD| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080720013401/http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic207.htm| archivedate = 2008-07-20| df = }}</ref>

Treatment of phenobarbital overdose is supportive, and mainly consists of the maintenance of [[airway]] patency (through [[endotracheal intubation]] and [[mechanical ventilation]]), correction of bradycardia and hypotension (with [[intravenous therapy|intravenous fluids]] and [[vasopressor]]s, if necessary) and removal of as much drug as possible from the body. Depending on how much time has elapsed since ingestion of the drug, this may be accomplished through [[gastric lavage]] (stomach pumping) or use of [[activated charcoal]]. [[Hemodialysis]] is effective in removing phenobarbital from the body, and may reduce its half-life by up to 90%.<ref name="Habal" /> No specific antidote for barbiturate poisoning is available.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000951.htm |title= Barbiturate intoxication and overdose |accessdate= 15 July 2008 |publisher= MedLine Plus |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081001212130/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000951.htm |archivedate= 1 October 2008 |df=  }}</ref>

British veterinarian [[Donald Sinclair (veterinarian)|Donald Sinclair]], better known as "Siegfried Farnon" in the "All Creatures Great and Small" books of [[James Herriot]], committed suicide at the age of 84 by injecting himself with an overdose of phenobarbital.

== Mechanism of action ==
Through its action on GABA receptors, phenobarbital increases flux of [[chloride]] ions into the neuron which decreases excitability. Direct blockade of excitatory [[glutamate]] signaling is also believed to contribute to the hypnotic/anticonvulsant effect that is observed with the barbiturates.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Phenobarbital has an oral [[bioavailability]] of about 90%. Peak plasma concentrations are reached eight to 12 hours after oral administration. It is one of the longest-acting barbiturates available – it remains in the body for a very long time (half-life of two to seven days) and has very low [[Plasma protein binding|protein binding]] (20 to 45%). Phenobarbital is metabolized by the liver, mainly through [[hydroxylation]] and [[glucuronidation]], and induces many [[isozyme]]s of the [[cytochrome P450 oxidase|cytochrome P450 system]]. Cytochrome P450 2B6 ([[CYP2B6]]) is specifically induced by phenobarbital via the [[Constitutive androstane receptor|CAR]]/[[Retinoid X receptor|RXR]] [[nuclear receptor]] [[heterodimer]]. It is excreted primarily by the [[kidney]]s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

== Veterinary uses ==

== History ==
The first barbiturate drug, [[barbital]], was synthesized in 1902 by German chemists [[Franz Joseph Emil Fischer|Emil Fischer]] and [[Joseph von Mering]] and was first marketed as '''Veronal''' by [[Bayer|Friedr. Bayer et comp]]. By 1904, several related drugs, including phenobarbital, had been synthesized by Fischer. Phenobarbital was brought to market in 1912 by the drug company Bayer as the brand '''Luminal'''. It remained a commonly prescribed sedative and hypnotic until the introduction of [[benzodiazepine]]s in the 1960s.<ref name="Sneader2005">{{cite book| last = Sneader| first = Walter| title = Drug Discovery| date=  2005-06-23| publisher = John Wiley and Sons| isbn = 0-471-89979-8| page = 369}}</ref>

Phenobarbital's soporific, sedative and hypnotic properties were well known in 1912, but it was not yet known to be an effective anticonvulsant. The young doctor Alfred Hauptmann<ref>{{cite web |url         = http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/2764.html |title       = Alfred Hauptmann |accessdate  = 2006-09-06 |author      = Ole Daniel Enersen |deadurl     = no |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20061109210437/http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/2764.html |archivedate = 2006-11-09 |df          = }}</ref> gave it to his epilepsy patients as a tranquilizer and discovered their seizures were susceptible to the drug. Hauptmann performed a careful study of his patients over an extended period. Most of these patients were using the only effective drug then available, [[potassium bromide|bromide]], which had terrible side effects and limited efficacy. On phenobarbital, their epilepsy was much improved: The worst patients suffered fewer and lighter seizures and some patients became seizure-free. In addition, they improved physically and mentally as bromides were removed from their regimen. Patients who had been institutionalised due to the severity of their epilepsy were able to leave and, in some cases, resume employment. Hauptmann dismissed concerns that its effectiveness in stalling seizures could lead to patients suffering a build-up that needed to be "discharged". As he expected, withdrawal of the drug led to an increase in seizure frequency – it was not a cure. The drug was quickly adopted as the first widely effective anticonvulsant, though [[World War I]] delayed its introduction in the U.S.<ref name="Scott1993">{{cite book| last = Scott,| first = Donald F| title = The History of Epileptic Therapy| date = 1993-02-15| publisher = Taylor & Francis| isbn = 1-85070-391-4| pages = 59–65}}</ref>

In 1939 a German family asked [[Adolf Hitler]] to have their disabled son killed, the five-month-old boy was given a lethal dose of Luminal after Hitler sent his own doctor to examine him. A few days later 15 psychiatrists were summoned to Hitler's Chancellery and directed to commence a clandestine euthanasia program.<ref>{{cite news|last=Zoech|first=Irene|title=Named: the baby boy who was Nazis' first euthanasia victim|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/1443967/Named-the-baby-boy-who-was-Nazis-first-euthanasia-victim.html|accessdate=1 November 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=12 October 2003|quote=The case was to provide the rationale for a secret Nazi decree that led to 'mercy killings' of almost 300,000 mentally and physically handicapped people.

In 1940, at a clinic in [[Ansbach]], Germany, around 50 intellectually disabled children were injected with Luminal and killed that way. A plaque was erected in their memory in 1988 in the local hospital at Feuchtwanger&nbsp;Strasse 38, although a newer plaque does not mention that patients were killed using barbiturates on site.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kaelber|first=Lutz|title=Kinderfachabteilung Ansbach|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~lkaelber/children/ansbach/ansbach.html|work=Sites of Nazi "Children's 'Euthanasia'" Crimes and Their Commemoration in Europe|publisher=University of Vermont|accessdate=1 November 2013|date=8 March 2013|quote=In the late 1980s, important developments occurred at the clinic that led to the first publication on the subject and the display of two plaques. Dr Reiner Weisenseel wrote his dissertation under Dr Athen, then the director of the Ansbacher Bezirkskrankenhaus, on the involvement of the clinic in Euthanasia crimes, including the operation of the Kinderfachabteilung. In 1988 two members of the Green Party as well as the regional diet (Bezirkstag) were horrified to find portraits of physicians involved in Nazi euthanasia crimes among the honorary display of medical personnel in the administrative building, and they successfully petitioned to have these portraits removed. Since 1992 a plaque hangs in the entry hall way of the administrative building. It reads: 'In the Third Reich the Ansbach facility delivered to their death more than 2000 of the patients entrusted to it as life unworthy of living: They were transferred to killing facilities or starved to death. In their own way many people incurred responsibility.' It continues: 'Half a century later full of shame we commemorate the victims and call to remember the Fifth Commandment.' The killing of children ''specifically transferred to the clinic to be murdered'' is not noted. The plaque does not address that that euthanasia victims were not only starved or transported to gassing facilities but killed using barbiturates on site.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103075613/http://www.uvm.edu/~lkaelber/children/ansbach/ansbach.html|archivedate=3 November 2013|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Binder | first = Johann | title = Die Heil- und Pflegeanstalt Ansbach während des Nationalsozialismus | url = http://www.bezirksklinikum-ansbach.de/fileadmin/user_upload/bilder/Ansbach/BklMfr_Flyer_61_AN_Gedenkorte_DRUCK_neu.pdf | work = Bezirksklinikum Ansbach | publisher = Bezirkskliniken Mittelfranken | accessdate = 1 November 2013 | language = German | format = PDF | date = October 2011 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131103130325/http://www.bezirksklinikum-ansbach.de/fileadmin/user_upload/bilder/Ansbach/BklMfr_Flyer_61_AN_Gedenkorte_DRUCK_neu.pdf | archivedate = 3 November 2013 | df =  }}</ref> Luminal was used in the Nazi "children's euthanasia" program until at least 1943.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kaelber|first=Lutz|title=Jewish Children with Disabilities and Nazi "Euthanasia" Crimes|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~lkaelber/children/leipzigdoesen/bull2013-Kaelber1.pdf|work=The Bulletin of the Carolyn and Leonard Miller Center for Holocaust Studies|publisher=University of Vermont|accessdate=1 November 2013|date=Spring 2013|quote=Two Polish physicians reported at the time that 235 children from ages up to 14 were listed in the booklet, of whom 221 had died.

== Names ==
Phenobarbital is the [[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]] and phenobarbitone is the [[British Approved Name|BAN]].

== Synthesis ==
[[Barbiturate]] drugs are obtained via [[condensation reaction]]s between a [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivative]] of [[diethyl malonate]] and [[urea]] in the presence of a strong [[base (chemistry)|base]].<ref name=Vogel>{{cite book|author1=Furniss, Brian|author2=Hannaford, Antony|author3=Smith, Peter|author4=Tatchell, Austin|title=Vogel's Textbook of Practical Organic Chemistry 5th Ed.|year=1996|publisher=Longman Science & Technical|location=London|isbn=978-0-582-46236-6|pages=1174–1179|url=https://archive.org/details/TextbookOfPracticalOrganicChemistry5thEd|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311011821/https://archive.org/details/TextbookOfPracticalOrganicChemistry5thEd|archivedate=2016-03-11|df=}}</ref> The synthesis of Phenobarbital uses this common approach as well but differs in the way in which this [[malonate]] derivative is obtained. The reason for this difference is due to the fact that [[aryl halide]]s do not typically act as [[nucleophiles]] in [[Malonic ester synthesis]] in the same way as [[aliphatic]] [[organosulfate]]s or [[halocarbon]]s do.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Adams|first1=Roger|title=Organic Reactions, Volume 9|date=1957|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-00726-5|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471007269.html|accessdate=18 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031013218/http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471007269.html|archivedate=31 October 2014|df=}}</ref> To overcome this lack of [[Reactivity (chemistry)|chemical reactivity]] two dominant synthetic approaches using [[benzyl cyanide]] as a starting material have been developed:

The first of these methods consists of a [[Pinner reaction]] of benzyl cyanide, giving [[phenylacetic acid]] ethyl ester.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=Roger|last2=Thal|first2=A.
