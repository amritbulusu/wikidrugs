'''Oxandrolone''' (brand names '''Oxandrin''', '''Anavar''', '''Lonavar''', others), is a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]], [[oral administration|orally active]] [[anabolic-androgenic steroid]] (AAS) that first became available as a [[prescription drug]] in the [[United States]] in 1964. It is a [[17α-alkylated AAS|17α-methylated]] [[chemical derivative|derivative]] of [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT) that has an [[oxygen]] [[atom]] in place of the [[carbon]] at the 2 position.

Researchers and medical professionals have used oxandrolone to treat a wide variety of disorders. These include [[idiopathic short stature]], [[Turner syndrome]], body mass loss from [[catabolic]] illness or long-term [[corticosteroid]] treatment, severe burns, surgical or general trauma, [[osteoporosis]], [[anemia]], [[hereditary angioedema]], [[HIV/AIDS]]-induced [[wasting]], [[alcoholic hepatitis]], and [[hypogonadism]].<ref name="Bork2012">{{cite journal|last1=Bork|first1=Konrad|title=Current Management Options for Hereditary Angioedema|journal=Current Allergy and Asthma Reports|volume=12|issue=4|year=2012|pages=273–280|issn=1529-7322|doi=10.1007/s11882-012-0273-4}}</ref>

Oxandrolone increases both short-term and long-term outcomes in patients recovering from severe burns. Most evidence shows that it reduces the amount of time spent hospitalized and that improved muscle and bone recovery are still measurable a year after injury.<ref name="LiGuo2016" /><ref name="RojasFinnerty2012" />
<!-- we should discuss the details of Turner syndrome treatment here -->

Research suggests that oxandrolone is also effective in the treatment of [[alcoholic hepatitis]].<ref name="ChoiRunyon2012">{{cite journal|last1=Choi|first1=Gina|last2=Runyon|first2=Bruce Allen|title=Alcoholic Hepatitis: A Clinician’s Guide|journal=Clinics in Liver Disease|volume=16|issue=2|year=2012|pages=371–385|issn=1089-3261|doi=10.1016/j.cld.2012.03.015}}</ref>

==Contraindications==
Like other anabolic steroids, oxandrolone may worsen [[hypercalcemia]] by increasing [[osteolytic bone resorption]].<ref name="UpsherSmithLabel" /> When taken by pregnant women, oxandrolone may have unintended effects such as [[masculinization]] on the fetus.<ref name="UpsherSmithLabel" />

==Side effects==
{{See also|Anabolic steroid#Adverse effects}}

Women who are administered oxandrolone may experience [[virilization]], irreversible development of masculine features such as [[voice deepening]], [[hirsutism]], [[menstrual disturbance|menstruation abnormalities]], [[male-pattern hair loss]], and [[clitoral enlargement]].<ref name="ShortStature2015" /><ref name="UpsherSmithLabel" /><ref name="SasGault2014" /> Oxandrolone may disrupt growth in children, reducing their adult height.<ref name="medline" />{{Better source needed|date=June 2017}} Because of these side effects, doses given to women and children are chosen carefully and patients are usually monitored for virilization and growth abnormalities.<ref name="ShortStature2015" /><ref name="SasGault2014" /> Like other [[androgen]]s, oxandrolone can cause or worsen [[acne]] and [[priapism]] (unwanted or prolonged erections).<ref name="UpsherSmithLabel" /><ref name="medline">{{cite web | url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a604024.html | title=Oxandrolone | publisher=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Inc. | work=MedlinePlus | date=15 May 2016 | accessdate=21 June 2016}}</ref> Oxandrolone can also reduce males' fertility, another side effect common among androgens.<ref name="medline" /> In an attempt to compensate for the exogenous increase in androgens, the body may reduce testosterone production via [[testicular atrophy]] and inhibition of [[gonadotropic]] activity.<ref name="UpsherSmithLabel" />

Unlike some AAS, oxandrolone does not generally cause [[gynecomastia]] because it is not [[aromatized]] into [[estrogenic]] metabolites.<ref name="CoronaRastrelli2012" /> However, although no reports of gynecomastia were made in spite of widespread use, oxandrolone was reported in a publication in 1991 to have been associated with 33&nbsp;cases of gynecomastia in adolescent boys treated with it for [[short stature]].<ref name="Aronson2009">{{cite book|author=Jeffrey K.

Like other anabolic steroids, oxandrolone is an [[agonist]] of the [[androgen receptor]], similarly to [[androgen]]s like [[testosterone]] and DHT. This increases protein synthesis, which increases muscle growth, lean body mass, and bone mineral density.<ref name="RojasFinnerty2012" />

Compared to testosterone and many other anabolic steroids, oxandrolone is less androgenic relative to its strength as an [[anabolic]].<ref name="katzung">{{cite book | editor-last = Katzung | editor-first = Bertram G. | last = Chrousos | first = George P. | chapter = The Gonadal Hormones & Inhibitors | title = Basic & Clinical Pharmacology | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical McGraw-Hill distributor | location = New York London | year = 2012 | isbn = 0071764011 | page = 735 }}</ref> This often motivates its medical use in children and women because less androgenic effect implies less risk of virilization. The bodybuilding community also considers this fact when choosing between steroids.<ref name="llewellyn" />

==Dosage==
Children with idiopathic short stature or Turner syndrome are given doses of oxandrolone far smaller than those given to burn patients. Researchers have chosen dose ranges for children with great care to minimize the likelihood of virilization and premature maturation.<ref name="ShortStature2015" /><ref name="SasGault2014">{{cite journal|last1=Sas|first1=T.C.J.|last2=Gault|first2=E.J.|last3=Zeger Bardsley|first3=M.|last4=Menke|first4=L.A.|last5=Freriks|first5=K.|last6=Perry|first6=R.J.|last7=Otten|first7=B.J.|last8=de Muinck Keizer-Schrama|first8=S.M.P.F.|last9=Timmers|first9=H.|last10=Wit|first10=J.M.|last11=Ross|first11=J.L.|last12=Donaldson|first12=M.D.C.|title=Safety and Efficacy of Oxandrolone in Growth Hormone-Treated Girls with Turner Syndrome: Evidence from Recent Studies and Recommendations for Use|journal=Hormone Research in Paediatrics|volume=81|issue=5|year=2014|pages=289–297|issn=1663-2826|doi=10.1159/000358195}}</ref> Most adults treated with oxandrolone receive moderate doses.<ref name="LiGuo2016" /><ref name="ChoiRunyon2012" /><ref name="CoronaRastrelli2012">{{cite journal|last1=Corona|first1=Giovanni|last2=Rastrelli|first2=Giulia|last3=Vignozzi|first3=Linda|last4=Maggi|first4=Mario|title=Emerging medication for the treatment of male hypogonadism|journal=Expert Opinion on Emerging Drugs|volume=17|issue=2|year=2012|pages=239–259|issn=1472-8214|doi=10.1517/14728214.2012.683411|pmid=22612692}}</ref> Bodybuilders often take doses much higher than these.<ref name=":0" /> Oxandrolone is generally administered at least once daily.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2016}}

Oxandrolone was first made by Raphael Pappo and Christopher J. Jung while at [[Searle Laboratories]] (now part of [[Pfizer]]). The researchers first described the chemical in 1962.<ref name="PappoJung1962">{{cite journal|last1=Pappo|first1=Raphael|last2=Jung|first2=Christopher J.|title=2-oxasteroids: A new class of biologically active compounds|journal=Tetrahedron Letters|volume=3|issue=9|year=1962|pages=365–371|issn=0040-4039|doi=10.1016/S0040-4039(00)70883-5}}</ref><ref name="FoxMinot1962">{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=Maurice|last2=Minot|first2=Ann S.|last3=Liddle|first3=Grant W.|title=Oxandrolone: A Potent Anabolic Steroid of Novel Chemical Configuration|journal=The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism|volume=22|issue=9|year=1962|pages=921–924|issn=0021-972X|doi=10.1210/jcem-22-9-921}}</ref> They were immediately interested in oxandrolone's very weak androgenic effect relative to its anabolic effect.<ref name="PappoJung1962" /> It was released as a pharmaceutical drug in the United States in 1964.

The drug was prescribed to promote muscle regrowth in disorders which cause involuntary weight loss, and is used as part of treatment for [[HIV/AIDS]].  It had also been shown to be partially successful in treating cases of [[osteoporosis]]. However, in part due to bad publicity from its illicit use by [[bodybuilding|bodybuilders]], production of Anavar was discontinued by Searle Laboratories in 1989. It was picked up by Bio-Technology General Corporation, which changed its name to [[Savient Pharmaceuticals]], which following successful clinical trials in 1995, released it under the tradename Oxandrin.<ref name="llewellyn"/> BTG subsequently won approvals for [[orphan drug]] status by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] for treating [[alcoholic hepatitis]], [[Turner syndrome]], and HIV-induced [[wasting syndrome|weight loss]].  It is also indicated as an offset to [[protein catabolism]] caused by long-term administration of [[corticosteroids]].

==Society and culture==

===Legal status===
{{See also|Anabolic steroid#Legal status}}
In the United States, oxandrolone is categorized as a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule III controlled substances|Schedule III controlled substance]] under the [[Controlled Substances Act]] along with many other anabolic steroids.<ref>{{cite web | title=Controlled Substances Act | url=http://www.fda.gov/regulatoryinformation/legislation/ucm148726.htm | publisher=United States Food and Drug Administration | date=11 June 2009 | accessdate=17 June 2016}}</ref> It is a [[Schedule IV (Canada)|Schedule IV]] controlled substance in Canada,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-38.8/page-15.html|title=Consolidated federal laws of canada, Controlled Drugs and Substances Act|last=Branch|first=Legislative Services|website=laws-lois.justice.gc.ca|access-date=2017-01-14}}</ref> and a [[Controlled Drug in United Kingdom#Schedule 4|Schedule 4 Controlled Drug]] in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/controlled-drugs-list--2/list-of-most-commonly-encountered-drugs-currently-controlled-under-the-misuse-of-drugs-legislation|title=List of most commonly encountered drugs currently controlled under the misuse of drugs legislation - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|access-date=2017-01-14}}</ref>

===Non-medical use===
<!-- "Non-medical use" seems like a better title than "Recreational use" for this case  -Risc64 -->
Many bodybuilders and athletes use oxandrolone for its muscle-building properties. It is much less [[Anabolic steroid#Anabolic and androgenic effects|androgenic than anabolic]], so women and those seeking less intense steroid regimens use it particularly often.<ref name="llewellyn" /> Many also value oxandrolone's low hepatotoxicity relative to most other orally active steroids.<ref name="llewellyn" />
The infamous "duchess" cocktail administered to Russian athletes at the Sochi Winter Olympics consisted of Oxandrolone, [[Methenolone]] and [[Trenbolone]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=McLaren|first1=Richard|title=WADA investigation of Sochi allegations|url=https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/mclaren_report_part_ii_2.pdf|accessdate=9 December 2016}}</ref>

===Brand names===
The original brand name of oxandrolone was Anavar. Oxandrin is often used as a generic trade name. Oxandrolone has also been sold under the trade names Lonavar (Argentina, Australia), Antitriol (Spain), Anatrophill (France), Protivar, and Vasorome.<ref name="llewellyn">{{cite book | last=Llewellyn | first=William | title=William Llewellyn's Anabolics | publisher=Molecular Nutrition, LLC | location=Jupiter, FL | year=2011 | isbn=978-0-9828280-1-4 | pages=610–616}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Drugs_of_Abuse.pdf | title=Drugs of Abuse | publisher=United States Drug Enforcement Administration | year=2011 | pages=22}}</ref> Additional brand names exist for products that are manufactured for the steroid black market.<ref name="llewellyn" />
