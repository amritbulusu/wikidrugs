[[File:Butrans10mcg.jpeg|thumb|Butrans 10mcg/hr patches in the pouch with packaging. A removed patch is shown on the left.]]

Its primary uses in medicine are in the treatment of those addicted to opioids, such as [[heroin]] and [[oxycodone]], but it may also be used to treat pain, and sometimes nausea in [[antiemetic]] intolerant individuals, most often in [[transdermal patch]] form.<ref name = AMH/>

===Opioid addiction===
{{See also|Buprenorphine/naloxone}}

====Buprenorphine versus methadone====
Both buprenorphine and [[methadone]] are medications used for detoxification, short- and long-term [[opioid replacement therapy]]. Buprenorphine has the advantage of being only a partial agonist; hence negating the potential for life-threatening respiratory depression in cases of abuse.<ref name = MD/> Studies show the effectiveness of buprenorphine and methadone are almost identical, and largely share adverse-effect profiles apart from more sedation among methadone users. At low flexible doses from 2 to 6&nbsp;mg, however, buprenorphine has a lower retention rate than from low doses 40&nbsp;mg or less of [[methadone]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mattick|first=Richard P.|last2=Breen|first2=Courtney|last3=Kimber|first3=Jo|last4=Davoli|first4=Marina|date=2014-02-06|title=Buprenorphine maintenance versus placebo or methadone maintenance for opioid dependence|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=2|pages=CD002207|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002207.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=24500948}}</ref>

====Inpatient rehabilitation and detoxification====
Rehabilitation programs consist of "detox" and "treatment" phases. The detoxification ("detox") phase consists of medically supervised withdrawal from the drug of dependency onto buprenorphine, sometimes aided by the use of medications such as [[benzodiazepine]]s like [[oxazepam]] or [[diazepam]] (modern milder tranquilizers that assist with anxiety, sleep, and muscle relaxation), [[clonidine]] (a blood-pressure medication that may reduce some opioid withdrawal symptoms), and [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug|anti-inflammatory/pain relief]] drugs such as [[ibuprofen]] and [[aspirin]].

The treatment phase begins once the person is stabilized and receives medical clearance. This portion of treatment consists of multiple therapy sessions, which include both group and individual counseling with various chemical dependency counselors, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, and other professionals. In addition, many treatment centers utilize twelve-step facilitation techniques, embracing the 12-step programs practiced by such organizations as [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] and [[Narcotics Anonymous]]. Some people on maintenance therapies have veered away from such organizations as Narcotics Anonymous, instead opting to create their own twelve-step fellowships (such as Methadone Anonymous) or depart entirely from the twelve-step model of recovery, seeking a program which is secular and based on science (such as [[SMART Recovery]]) rather than faith.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Glickman L, Galanter M, Dermatis H, Dingle S | title = Recovery and spiritual transformation among peer leaders of a modified methadone anonymous group | journal = J Psychoactive Drugs | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 531–3 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17373569 | doi = 10.1080/02791072.2006.10400592 }}<br />{{cite journal |vauthors=Gilman SM, Galanter M, Dermatis H | title = Methadone Anonymous: A 12-Step Program for Methadone Maintained Heroin Addicts | journal = Subst Abus | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 247–256 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 12466684 | doi = 10.1080/08897070109511466 }}<br />{{cite journal | author = McGonagle D | title = Methadone anonymous: a 12-step program.

===Chronic pain relief===
A [[transdermal patch]] is available for the treatment of chronic pain. It is not indicated for use in acute pain, pain that is expected to last only for a short period of time, or post-operative pain, nor is it indicated or recommended for use in the treatment of opioid addiction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Butrans Medication Guide|url=http://app.purduepharma.com/xmlpublishing/pi.aspx?id=b&medguide=1|website=Butrans Medication Guide|publisher=Purdue Pharma L.P.|accessdate=7 July 2014}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
[[File:Rational harm assessment of drugs radar plot.svg|thumb|Addiction experts in psychiatry, chemistry, pharmacology, forensic science, epidemiology, and the police and legal services engaged in [[Delphi method|delphic analysis]] of 20 popular recreational drugs. Buprenorphine was ranked 9th in dependence, 8th in physical harm, and 11th in social harm.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nutt|first1=D|last2=King|first2=LA|last3=Saulsbury|first3=W|last4=Blakemore|first4=C|title=Development of a rational scale to assess the harm of drugs of potential misuse.|journal=Lancet|date=24 March 2007|volume=369|issue=9566|pages=1047–53|pmid=17382831|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60464-4}}</ref>]]

Common [[adverse drug reaction]]s associated with the use of buprenorphine are similar to those of other opioids and include: nausea and vomiting, drowsiness, dizziness, headache, memory loss, cognitive and neural inhibition, perspiration, itchiness, dry mouth, shrinking of the pupils of the eyes ([[miosis]]), [[orthostatic hypotension]], male ejaculatory difficulty, decreased libido, and [[urinary retention]]. [[Constipation]] and CNS effects are seen less frequently than with morphine.<ref name="Budd">Budd K, Raffa RB. (eds.) ''Buprenorphine – The unique opioid analgesic''. Thieme, 200, {{ISBN|3-13-134211-0}}</ref>

===Buprenorphine dependence===
Buprenorphine treatment carries the risk of causing psychological or physical dependence. Buprenorphine has a slow onset, has a mild effect, and is very long acting with a half-life of 24 to 60 hours. Once a patient has stabilized on the drug, there are two treatment options: continual use/maintenance, or medically supervised withdrawal from the physical dependence to the drug.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buprenorphine.samhsa.gov/about.html|title=About Buprenorphine Therapy|website=Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration|accessdate=15 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215121106/http://buprenorphine.samhsa.gov/about.html|archivedate=15 December 2014|df=}}</ref>

===Respiratory effects===
The most severe and serious adverse reaction associated with opioid use, in general, is respiratory depression, the mechanism behind fatal overdose.

Buprenorphine behaves differently than other opioids in this respect, as it shows a [[Ceiling effect (pharmacology)|ceiling effect]] for respiratory depression.<ref name="Budd"/> Moreover, doubts about the antagonisation of the respiratory effects by naloxone have been disproved: Buprenorphine effects can be antagonised with a continuous infusion of naloxone.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=van Dorp E, Yassen A, Sarton E, Romberg R, Olofsen E, Teppema L, Danhof M, Dahan A | title = Naloxone reversal of buprenorphine-induced respiratory depression | journal = Anesthesiology | volume = 105 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–7 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16809994 | doi = 10.1097/00000542-200607000-00012 }}</ref>

Concurrent use of buprenorphine with other CNS depressants (such as alcohol or [[benzodiazepine]]s) is contraindicated as it may lead to fatal respiratory depression. Benzodiazepines, in recommended doses, are not contraindicated in individuals tolerant to either opioids or benzodiazepines.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Pain management===
People on high-dose buprenorphine therapy may be unaffected by even large doses of opioids such as [[oxycodone]], [[morphine]], or [[hydromorphone]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

It is also difficult to achieve acute opioid [[analgesia]] in persons using buprenorphine for opioid replacement therapy.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Acute Pain Management for Patients Receiving Maintenance Methadone or Buprenorphine Therapy|journal = Annals of Internal Medicine|date = 17 January 2006|issn = 0003-4819|pmc = 1892816|pmid = 16418412|pages = 127–134|volume = 144|issue = 2|first = Daniel P.|last = Alford|first2 = Peggy|last2 = Compton|first3 = Jeffrey H.|last3 = Samet|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-144-2-200601170-00010}}</ref>

====Opioid receptor modulator====
Buprenorphine has been reported to possess the following [[pharmacological activity]]:<ref name="pmid24903063" />

* [[μ-Opioid receptor]] (MOR): Weak partial agonist. Binds with high affinity, but only partially activates the receptor. This behavior is responsible for buprenorphine's ability to block most μ agonists and the phenomenon of withdrawal effects when used in actively opioid dependent persons.
* [[κ-Opioid receptor]] (KOR): Very weak partial agonist or functional antagonist. Possible therapeutic applications as animal models show antidepressive, anxiolytic, stress relieving, and anti-addictive properties with κ antagonists.
* [[δ-Opioid receptor]] (DOR): Antagonist. Possible attenuation of drug reward.
* [[Nociceptin receptor]] (NOP, ORL-1): Weak affinity. Very weak partial agonist. May be involved in lack of respiratory depression with buprenorphine in overdose.

In simplified terms, buprenorphine can essentially be thought of as a non-selective, mixed [[agonist–antagonist]] [[opioid receptor modulator]],<ref name="pmid572694">{{cite journal |vauthors=Jacob JJ, Michaud GM, Tremblay EC | title = Mixed agonist-antagonist opiates and physical dependence | journal = Br J Clin Pharmacol | volume = 7 Suppl 3 | issue = | pages = 291S–296S | year = 1979 | pmid = 572694 | pmc = 1429306 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2125.1979.tb04703.x| url = }}</ref> acting as a weak [[partial agonist]] of the MOR, an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of the KOR, an antagonist of the DOR, and a relatively low-affinity, very weak partial agonist of the ORL-1.<ref name="pmid18997874" /><ref name="pmid18567516">{{cite journal | author = Kress HG | title = Clinical update on the pharmacology, efficacy and safety of transdermal buprenorphine | journal = Eur J Pain | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 219–30 |date=March 2009 | pmid = 18567516 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejpain.2008.04.011 | url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid12481193">{{cite journal | author = Robinson SE | title = Buprenorphine: an analgesic with an expanding role in the treatment of opioid addiction | journal = CNS Drug Rev | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 377–90 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12481193 | doi = | url = }}</ref><ref name="RuizStrain2011">{{cite book | author1 = Pedro Ruiz | author2 = Eric C.

====Other actions====
Unlike some other opioids and opioid antagonists, buprenorphine binds only weakly to and possesses little if any activity at the [[sigma receptor]].<ref name="Doweiko2014">{{cite book|author=Harold E. Doweiko|title=Concepts of Chemical Dependency|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IuAbCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA149|date=14 March 2014|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-285-45717-8|pages=149–}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=USP DI.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I-SwfGseCqoC|publisher=United States Pharmacopeial Convention}}</ref>

Buprenorphine also blocks [[voltage-gated sodium channel]]s via the [[local anesthetic]] binding site, and this underlies its potent local anesthetic properties.<ref name="pmid22504149" />

Similarly to various other opioids, buprenorphine has also been found to act as an agonist of the [[toll-like receptor 4]], albeit with very low affinity.<ref name="pmid19679181" />

===Pharmacokinetics===
Buprenorphine is metabolised by the [[liver]], via [[CYP3A4]] (also [[CYP2C8]] seems to be involved) isozymes of the [[cytochrome P450 oxidase|cytochrome P450]] enzyme system, into [[norbuprenorphine]] (by ''N''-dealkylation). The [[glucuronidation]] of buprenorphine is primarily carried out by [[UGT1A1]] and [[UGT2B7]], and that of norbuprenorphine by [[UGT1A1]] and [[UGT1A3]]. These glucuronides are then eliminated mainly through excretion into the bile. The [[elimination half-life]] of buprenorphine is 20–73 hours (mean 37). Due to the mainly hepatic elimination, there is no risk of accumulation in people with renal impairment.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Moody DE, Fang WB, Lin SN, Weyant DM, Strom SC, Omiecinski CJ | title = Effect of Rifampin and Nelfinavir on the Metabolism of Methadone and Buprenorphine in Primary Cultures of Human Hepatocytes | journal = Drug Metabolism and Disposition | volume = 37 | issue = 12 | pages = 2323–2329 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19773542 | pmc = 2784702 | doi = 10.1124/dmd.109.028605 }}</ref>

One of the major [[active metabolite]]s of buprenorphine is norbuprenorphine, which, contrary to buprenorphine itself, is a [[full agonist]] of the MOR, DOR, and ORL-1, and a partial agonist at the KOR.<ref name="pmid">{{cite journal |vauthors=Yassen A, Kan J, Olofsen E, Suidgeest E, Dahan A, Danhof M | title = Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling of the respiratory depressant effect of norbuprenorphine in rats | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 321 | issue = 2 | pages = 598–607 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17283225 | doi = 10.1124/jpet.106.115972 }}</ref><ref name="pmid11303059">{{cite journal |vauthors=Huang P, Kehner GB, Cowan A, Liu-Chen LY | title = Comparison of pharmacological activities of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine: Norbuprenorphine is a potent opioid agonist | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 297 | issue = 2 | pages = 688–695 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11303059 }}</ref> However, relative to buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine has extremely little antinociceptive potency (1/50th that of buprenorphine), but markedly depresses respiration (10-fold more than buprenorphine).<ref name="pmid22739506">{{cite journal |vauthors=Brown SM, Campbell SD, Crafford A, Regina KJ, Holtzman MJ, Kharasch ED | title = P-glycoprotein is a major determinant of norbuprenorphine brain exposure and antinociception | journal = J.

==Chemistry==
Buprenorphine is a semi-synthetic analogue of [[thebaine]]<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Heel RC, Brogden RN, Speight TM, Avery GS | title = Buprenorphine: a review of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic efficacy. | journal = Drugs | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 81–110 | date = February 1979 | pmid = 378645 | doi = 10.2165/00003495-197917020-00001 }}</ref> and is fairly soluble in water, as its hydrochloride salt.<ref name = MD/> It degrades in the presence of light.<ref name = MD/>

===Detection in body fluids===
Buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine may be quantitated in blood or urine to monitor use or abuse, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or assist in a medicolegal investigation. There is a significant overlap of drug concentrations in body fluids within the possible spectrum of physiological reactions ranging from asymptomatic to comatose. Therefore, it is critical to have knowledge of both the route of administration of the drug and the level of tolerance to opioids of the individual when results are interpreted.<ref>{{Cite book | author = Baselt, R. | date = 2008 | title = Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man | edition = 8th | publisher = Biomedical Publications | location = Foster City, CA | pages = 190–192 | isbn = 0962652377}}</ref>

==History==
In 1969, researchers at Reckitt & Colman (now [[Reckitt Benckiser]]) had spent 10 years attempting to synthesize an opioid compound "with structures substantially more complex than morphine [that] could retain the desirable actions whilst shedding the undesirable side effects". [[Physical dependence]] and withdrawal from buprenorphine itself, remains an issue because it is a long-acting opiate.<ref>{{cite web|title=IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION|url=http://www.suboxone.com/medical-treatment/side-effects-adverse-events}}</ref> Reckitt found success when researchers synthesized RX6029 which had showed success in reducing dependence in test animals.

==Society and culture==

===Regulation===
In the United States, buprenorphine (Subutex) and buprenorphine with [[naloxone]] (Suboxone) were approved for opioid addiction by the [[United States]] [[Food and Drug Administration]] in October 2002.<ref name=FDAApproval>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2002/20732,20733ltr.pdf Subutex and Suboxone Approval Letter]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (October 8, 2002). fda.gov.</ref> The FDA rescheduled buprenorphine from a [[Controlled Substances Act|Schedule V drug]] to a [[Controlled Substances Act|Schedule III drug]] just before approval of Subutex and Suboxone. The ACSCN for buprenorphine is 9064, and being a Schedule III substance it does not have an annual manufacturing quota imposed by the DEA.<ref>[http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/quotas/conv_factor/index.html Quotas – Conversion Factors for Controlled Substances]. Deadiversion.usdoj.gov. Retrieved on 2016-11-07.</ref> The salt in use is the hydrochloride, which has a free base conversion ratio of 0.928.

In the years prior to Suboxone's approval, Reckitt Benckiser had lobbied Congress to help craft the [[Drug Addiction Treatment Act]] of 2000 (DATA 2000), which gave authority to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to grant a waiver to physicians with certain training to prescribe and administer Schedule III, IV, or V narcotic drugs for the treatment of addiction or detoxification. Prior to the passage of this law, such treatment was not permitted in outpatient settings except for clinics designed specifically for drug addiction.<ref name=SAMHSA>[http://buprenorphine.samhsa.gov/titlexxxv.html "Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304203025/http://buprenorphine.samhsa.gov/titlexxxv.html |date=2013-03-04 }}. SAMHSA, U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.</ref>

The waiver, which can be granted after the completion of an eight-hour course, is required for outpatient treatment of opioid addiction with Subutex and Suboxone. Initially, the number of patients each approved physician could treat was limited to ten. This was eventually modified to allow approved physicians to treat up to a hundred patients with buprenorphine for opioid addiction in an outpatient setting.<ref>[http://naabt.org/30_patient_limit.cfm/ The National Alliance of Advocates for Buprenorphine Treatment]. naabt.org. Retrieved on 2013-05-19.</ref> This limit was recently increased by the Obama administration, raising the number of patients to which doctors can prescribe to 275.<ref>[http://www.businessinsider.com/obama-buprenorphine-suboxone-policy-2016-7 Obama administration's change on buprenorphine policy]. Business Insider (2016-07-06). Retrieved on 2016-11-07.</ref> Still, due to this patient limit and the requisite eight-hour training course, many continuing patients can find it very difficult to get a prescription, despite the drug's effectiveness.<ref>[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/02/02/practically-a-book-review-dying-to-be-free/ Practically a book review: Dying to be Free.] [[Slate Star Codex]]. Retrieved June 2015</ref>

In the [[European Union]], Subutex and Suboxone, buprenorphine's high-dose sublingual tablet preparations, were approved for opioid addiction treatment in September 2006.<ref>[http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/000697/human_med_001067.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d124 Suboxone EU Approval]. Ema.europa.eu. Retrieved on 2016-11-07.</ref> In the [[Netherlands]], buprenorphine is a List II drug of the [[Opium Law]], though special rules and guidelines apply to its prescription and dispensation.

===Brand names===
Buprenorphine is available under the trade names Cizdol, Suboxone, Subutex (typically used for opioid addiction), Temgesic ([[sublingual]] tablets for moderate to severe pain), Buprenex (solutions for injection often used for acute pain in primary-care settings), Norspan and Butrans ([[transdermal patch|transdermal preparations]] used for chronic pain).<ref name = MD>{{cite web|title=Buprenorphine|work=Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference|publisher=Pharmaceutical Press|location=London, UK|date=14 January 2014|accessdate=6 April 2014|url=http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/martindale/current/ms-19995-d.htm}}</ref>

Buprenorphine has been introduced in most European countries as a transdermal formulation (marketed as Transtec) for the treatment of chronic pain not responding to non-opioids.
