'''Plitidepsin''' (also known as '''dehydrodidemnin B''', marketed by PharmaMar, S.A. under the trade name '''Aplidin''') is a [[chemical compound]] extracted from the [[Ascidiacea|ascidian]] ''Aplidium albicans''.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Cragg, G.M.  |author2=Newman, D.J.  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal = Journal of Natural Products | year = 2004 | volume = 67 | issue = 8 | pages = 1216–1238 | doi=10.1021/np040031y | pmid=15332835 | title=Marine natural products and related compounds in clinical and advanced preclinical trials}}</ref> It is currently undergoing clinical trial testing.  It is a member of the class of compounds known as [[didemnin]]s.

==Chemical structure==
Plitidepsin is a cyclic [[depsipeptide]], meaning it is a [[Cyclic molecule|cyclic]] [[peptide]] in which there is one or more [[ester]] bond in place of one or more of a peptide bond. Its chemical structure is very close to that of [[didemnin B]], the only difference being that the [[Lactic acid|lactate]] residue in didemnin B is present in the [[Oxidation#Redox reactions in biology|oxidized]] [[pyruvate]] version.

==Pharmacological activity==
Like all didemnin compounds, plitidepsin exhibits [[Antineoplastic|antitumor]], [[Antiviral drug|antiviral]] and [[Immunosuppression|immunosuppressive]] activities. It shows promise in shrinking tumors in pancreatic, stomach, bladder, and prostate cancers.<ref>Garrison, Tom. ''Oceanography: An Invitation to Marine Science'' 4th ed. United States: Brooks/Cole. 2002. 98.</ref><ref name=Adrio>{{cite journal | title = Total Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Tamandarin B Analogues | author = Adrio, J.| journal = Journal of Organic Chemistry | year = 2007 | volume = 72 | issue = 14 | pages = 5129–5138 | doi=10.1021/jo070412r|display-authors=etal}}</ref> 

==Clinical trials==
In July 2003, plitidepsin was granted [[orphan drug]] status by the [[European Medicines Agency]] for treating [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]].<ref>[http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/comp/opinion/037804en.pdf Public Summary of Positive Opinion for Orphan Designation of Aplidine for the Treatment of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia]</ref>

As of 2007, it was undergoing multicenter [[Clinical trial#Phase II|phase II clinical trials]].<ref name=Adrio/> 

In 2016, early results in a small phase I trial for [[multiple myeloma]] were announced.<ref>[http://www.medpagetoday.com/clinical-context/MultipleMyeloma/58398 ASCO: Plitidepsin Shows Activity in Multiple Myeloma. June 2016]</ref>
