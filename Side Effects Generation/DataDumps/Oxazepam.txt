<!-- History, society and culture -->
Oxazepam was initially patented and marketed in 1965.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shorter|first1=Edward|title=A Historical Dictionary of Psychiatry|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780190292010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=juAJCAAAQBAJ&pg=PT66|chapter=B}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
It is an intermediate-acting benzodiazepine with a slow onset of action,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Galanter |first1=Marc |last2=Kleber |first2=Herbert D. |title=The American Psychiatric Publishing Textbook of Substance Abuse Treatment |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6wdJgejlQzYC&pg=PA216 |edition=4th |date=1 July 2008 |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing Inc |location=United States of America |isbn=978-1-58562-276-4 |page=216 |chapter= |chapterurl= }}</ref> so it is usually prescribed to individuals who have trouble staying asleep, rather than falling asleep. It is commonly prescribed for anxiety disorders with associated tension, irritability, and agitation. It is also prescribed for drug and [[alcohol withdrawal]], and for anxiety associated with [[clinical depression|depression]]. Physicians may use oxazepam outside its approved indications to treat [[social anxiety disorder|social phobia]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[insomnia]], [[premenstrual syndrome]], and other conditions.<ref>http://www.psychatlanta.com/documents/serax.pdf</ref>

==Use==
Oxazepam, along with diazepam, nitrazepam, and temazepam, were the four benzodiazepines listed on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and represented 82% of the benzodiazepine prescriptions in Australia in 1990-1991.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1753-6405.1993.tb00167.x | author = Mant A |author2=Whicker SD |author3=McManus P |author4=Birkett DJ |author5=Edmonds D |author6=Dumbrell D.  | title =Benzodiazepine utilisation in Australia: report from a new pharmacoepidemiological database | journal = Aust J Public Health. | volume =17 | issue =4 | pages=345–9 |date=December 1993 | pmid = 7911332 }}</ref>

==Side effects==
The side effects of oxazepam are similar to those of other benzodiazepines, and may include dizziness, drowsiness, headache, memory impairment, [[Paradoxical reaction|paradoxical excitement]], and [[anterograde amnesia]], but does not affect [[transient global amnesia]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}  Side effects due to rapid decrease in dose or abrupt withdrawal from oxazepam may include abdominal and muscle cramps, convulsions, depression, inability to fall asleep or stay asleep, sweating, tremors, or vomiting.<ref>[http://www.drugs.com/pdr/oxazepam.html Oxazepam patient advice including side effects<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Tolerance, dependence and withdrawal===
Oxazepam, as with other benzodiazepine drugs, can cause [[drug tolerance|tolerance]], [[physical dependence]], [[Substance dependence|addiction]], and [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]]. Withdrawal from oxazepam or other benzodiazepines often leads to withdrawal symptoms which are similar to those seen during alcohol and [[barbiturate]] withdrawal. The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can occur, though, at standard dosages and also after short-term use. Benzodiazepine treatment should be discontinued as soon as possible by a slow and gradual dose reduction regimen.<ref>{{cite journal | author = MacKinnon GL |author2=Parker WA. | year = 1982 | title = Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome: a literature review and evaluation | journal = The American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–33 | pmid = 6133446| doi = 10.3109/00952998209002608 }}</ref>

==Contraindications==
Oxazepam is contraindicated in [[myasthenia gravis]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], and limited pulmonary reserve, as well as severe [[hepatic disease]].

==Special precautions==
Benzodiazepines require special precautions if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals, and individuals with [[comorbid]] [[psychiatric disorders]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Authier | first1 = N. | last2 = Balayssac | first2 = D. | last3 = Sautereau | first3 = M. | last4 = Zangarelli | first4 = A. | last5 = Courty | first5 = P. | last6 = Somogyi | first6 = AA. | last7 = Vennat | first7 = B. | last8 = Llorca | first8 = PM. | last9 = Eschalier | first9 = A. | title = Benzodiazepine dependence: focus on withdrawal syndrome | journal = Ann Pharm Fr | volume = 67 | issue = 6 | pages = 408–13 |date=November 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharma.2009.07.001 | pmid = 19900604  }}</ref> Benzodiazepines including oxazepam are lipophilic drugs and rapidly penetrate membranes, so rapidly crosses over into the placenta with significant uptake of the drug.

===Pregnancy===
Oxazepam when taken during late in pregnancy, the [[third trimester]], causes a definite risk to the [[neonate]] including a severe [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]] including [[hypotonia]], and reluctance to suck, to [[apnoeic]] spells, [[cyanosis]], and impaired [[metabolic]] responses to cold stress. Floppy infant syndrome and sedation in the newborn may also occur. Symptoms of floppy infant syndrome and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome have been reported to persist from hours to months after birth.<ref>{{cite journal | author = McElhatton PR. |date=Nov–Dec 1994 | title = The effects of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy and lactation | journal = Reprod Toxicol. | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = 461–75 | pmid = 7881198 | doi = 10.1016/0890-6238(94)90029-9 }}</ref>

==Interactions==
As oxazepam is an active metabolite of diazepam, an overlap in possible interactions is likely with other drugs or food, with exception of the pharmacokinetic [[CYP450]] interactions (e.g. with [[cimetidine]]). Precautions and following the prescription are required when taking oxazepam (or other benzodiazepines) in combinations with antidepressant medication ([[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRI]]s such as [[Prozac]], [[Zoloft]], and [[Paxil]], or multiple reuptake inhibitors such as [[Wellbutrin]], [[Cymbalta]], or [[Effexor]]), potent [[Analgesic|painkillers]] (opioids, e.g. [[morphine]], [[oxycodone]] or [[methadone]]). Concurrent use of these medicines (as well as other benzodiazepines) can interact in a way that is difficult to predict.  Drinking alcohol when taking oxazepam is not recommended. Concomitant use of oxazepam and alcohol can lead to increased [[sedation]], severe problems with [[Motor coordination|coordination]] ([[ataxia]]), decreased muscle tone, and in severe cases or in predisposed patients, even to life-threatening [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]]s with [[respiratory depression]], [[coma]], and [[Collapse (medical)|collapse]].

==Overdose==
{{main|Benzodiazepine overdose}}
Oxazepam is generally less toxic in overdose than other benzodiazepines.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Buckley NA, Dawson AH, Whyte IM, O'Connell DL |title=Relative toxicity of benzodiazepines in overdose |journal=BMJ |volume=310 |issue=6974 |pages=219–21 |date=28 January 1995|pmid=7866122 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/310/6974/219 |pmc=2548618 |doi=10.1136/bmj.310.6974.219 }}</ref> Important factors which affect the severity of a benzodiazepine overdose include the dose ingested, the age of the patient, and health status prior to overdose. Benzodiazepine overdoses can be much more dangerous if a coingestion of other [[CNS depressants]] such as opiates or alcohol has occurred.

==Pharmacology==
Oxazepam is an intermediate-acting benzodiazepine of the 3-hydroxy family; it acts on [[benzodiazepine receptors]], resulting in increased effect of [[Gamma-aminobutyric acid|GABA]] to the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor which results in inhibitory effects on the [[central nervous system]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Skerritt JH |author2=Johnston GA. | date =  May 6, 1983 |  title = Enhancement of GABA binding by benzodiazepines and related anxiolytics | journal = Eur J Pharmacol. | volume = 89 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 193–8 | pmid = 6135616 | doi = 10.1016/0014-2999(83)90494-6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Oelschläger H. | date =  July 4, 1989 |  title = [Chemical and pharmacologic aspects of benzodiazepines] | journal = Schweiz Rundsch Med Prax. | volume = 78 | issue = 27–28 | pages = 766–72 | pmid = 2570451 | doi=}}</ref> The [[Biological half-life|half-life]] of oxazepam is four to 15 hours.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bcnc.org.uk/equivalence.html | title = Benzodiazepine equivalency table | accessdate = September 23, 2007 | author = Professor heather Ashton |date=April 2007 }}</ref> It has been shown to suppress [[cortisol]] levels.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Christensen P |author2=Lolk A |author3=Gram LF |author4=Kragh-Sørensen P.  | year = 1992 | title = Benzodiazepine-induced sedation and [[cortisol]] suppression.

Oxazepam is an active metabolite formed during the breakdown of [[diazepam]], [[nordazepam]], and certain similar drugs. It may be safer than many other benzodiazepines in patients with impaired liver function because it does not require hepatic oxidation, but rather, it is simply metabolized by [[glucuronidation]], so oxazepam is less likely to accumulate and cause adverse reactions in the elderly or people with liver disease. Oxazepam is similar to [[lorazepam]] in this respect. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=8700792&itool=iconabstr&query_hl=14&itool=pubmed_DocSum (1)]
Preferential storage of oxazepam occurs in some organs, including the heart of the neonate. Absorption by any administered route and the risk of accumulation is significantly increased in the neonate, and withdrawal of oxazepam during pregnancy and breast feeding is recommended, as oxazepam is excreted in breast milk.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Olive G |author2=Dreux C. |date=January 1977 | title = Pharmacologic bases of use of benzodiazepines in peréinatal medicine | journal = Arch Fr Pediatr | volume = 34 | pages = 74–89 | pmid = 851373 | issue = 1 }}</ref>

==Chemistry==
Oxazepam exists as a [[racemic mixture]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Aso |first=Yukio |last2= et al |first2= |date=1988 |title=The Kinetics of the Racemization of Oxazepam in Aqueous Solution |url=http://doi.org/10.1248/cpb.36.1834 |journal=Chemical and Pharmaceutical Bulletin |publisher= |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=1834–1840 |doi= 10.1248/cpb.36.1834|access-date=September 9, 2016 }}</ref> Early attempts to isolate [[enantiomers]] were unsuccessful; the corresponding [[acetate]] has been isolated as a single enantiomer. Given the different rates of [[epimerization]] that occur at different pH levels, it was determined that there would be no therapeutic benefit to the administration of a single enantiomer over the racemic mixture.<ref>{{cite book |last=Crossley |first=Roger J. |date=1995 |title=Chirality and Biological Activity of Drugs |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N7zds_HN9r4C&lpg=PA8&ots=ehPmhw-g-9&dq=oxazepam%20racemate&pg=PA8#v=onepage&q=oxazepam%20racemate&f=false |location= |publisher=CRC Press |page= |isbn=0849391407}}</ref>

===Misuse===
{{See also|Benzodiazepine drug misuse}}
Oxazepam has the potential for misuse, defined as taking the drug to achieve a high, or continuing to take the drug in the long term against medical advice.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Griffiths RR, Johnson MW |title=Relative abuse liability of hypnotic drugs: a conceptual framework and algorithm for differentiating among compounds |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=66 Suppl 9 |issue= |pages=31–41 |year=2005 |pmid=16336040 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Benzodiazepines, including diazepam, oxazepam, nitrazepam, and flunitrazepam, accounted for the largest volume of forged drug prescriptions in Sweden from 1982 to 1986. During this time, a total of 52% of drug forgeries were for benzodiazepines, suggesting they were a major prescription drug class of abuse.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bergman U |author2=Dahl-Puustinen ML. | year = 1989 | title = Use of prescription forgeries in a drug abuse surveillance network | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 621–3 | pmid = 2776820 | journal = Eur J Clin Pharmacol.| doi = 10.1007/BF00637747}}</ref>

However, due to its slow rate of absorption and its slow onset of action,<ref name="autogenerated386"/> oxazepam has a relatively low potential for abuse compared to some other benzodiazepines, such as temazepam, flunitrazepam, or [[triazolam]], which have a high potential for abuse similar to barbiturates.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Griffiths RR, Wolf B |title=Relative abuse liability of different benzodiazepines in drug abusers |journal=J Clin Psychopharmacol |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=237–43 |date=August 1990 |pmid=1981067 |doi= 10.1097/00004714-199008000-00002|url=}}</ref>
