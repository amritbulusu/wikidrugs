'''Benzalkonium chloride''', also known as '''BZK''', '''BKC''', '''BAC''', '''alkyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride''' and '''ADBAC''', is a type of [[Surfactant#Cationic head groups|cationic surfactant]].  It is an organic [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] classified as a [[quaternary ammonium compound]].  It has three main categories of use: as a [[biocide]], a [[cationic]] [[surfactant]], and as a [[phase transfer agent]].<ref>Maximilian Lackner, Josef Peter Guggenbichler "Antimicrobial Surfaces" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2013.  {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.q03_q01}}</ref>  ADBACs are a [[mixture]] of alkylbenzyldimethylammonium chlorides, in which the alkyl group has various even-numbered alkyl chain lengths.

==Solubility and physical properties==
Depending on purity, benzalkonium chloride ranges from colourless to a pale yellow (impure).  Benzalkonium chloride is readily soluble in [[ethanol]] and [[acetone]]. Although dissolution in water is slow, [[aqueous solution]]s are easier to handle and are preferred. Aqueous solutions should be neutral to slightly alkaline. Solutions foam when shaken.  Concentrated solutions have a bitter taste and a faint almond-like odour.

Standard concentrates are manufactured as 50% and 80% w/w solutions, and sold under trade names such as BC50, BC80, BAC50, BAC80, etc. The 50% solution is purely aqueous, while more concentrated solutions require incorporation of [[rheology]] modifiers ([[alcohol]]s, [[polyethylene glycol]]s, etc.) to prevent increases in viscosity or gel formation under low temperature conditions.

==Cationic surfactant==
Benzalkonium chloride also possesses surfactant properties, dissolving the lipid phase of the tear film and increasing drug penetration, making it a useful [[excipient]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Clinical Ocular Pharmacology|publisher=Elsevier|year=2013|isbn=1-483-19391-8|edition=2|page=20|last1=Bartlett|first1=J}}<!--ISBN 1-483-19391-8, ISBN 978-1-483-19391-5 --></ref>
* Laundry detergents and treatments
* Softeners for textiles

==Phase transfer agent==
{{main|Phase transfer catalysis}}
Benzalkonium chloride is a mainstay of phase-transfer catalysis, an important technology in the synthesis of organic compounds, including drugs.

==Bioactive agents==
Especially for their antimicrobial activity, benzalkonium chloride is an active ingredient in many consumer products:
* Pharmaceutical products such as [[eye drop|eye]], [[ear drop|ear]] and nasal drops or [[Nasal spray|sprays]], as a preservative
* Personal care products such as [[hand sanitizer]]s, [[wet wipe]]s, [[shampoo]]s, deodorants and cosmetics
* Skin antiseptics, such as [[Bactine]] and [[Dettol]]
* Some disinfectant solutions, such as post-[[Body piercing|piercing]] ear disinfectants.
* Throat lozenges<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/medicine-guides/pages/MedicineOverview.aspx?medicine=Bradosol%20Sugar%20Free%20lozenges|title=Bradosol|publisher=}}</ref> and [[mouthwash]]es, as a biocide
* [[Spermicide|Spermicidal]] creams
* Over-the-counter single-application treatments for herpes, cold-sores, and fever blisters, such as RELEEV and Viroxyn
* Burn and ulcer treatment
* Spray disinfectants for hard surface sanitization
* Cleaners for floor and hard surfaces as a disinfectant, such as [[Lysol]]
* [[Algaecide]]s for clearing of algae, moss, lichens from paths, roof tiles, swimming pools, masonry, etc.
Benzalkonium chloride is also used in many non-consumer processes and products, including as an active ingredient in surgical disinfection. A comprehensive list of uses includes industrial applications.<ref>{{cite book|title=Handbook of Preservatives|last2=Ash|first2=I|publisher=Synapse Info Resources|year=2004|isbn=1-890-59566-7|page=286|last1=Ash|first1=M}}<!--ISBN 1-890-59566-7, ISBN 978-1-890-59566-1 --></ref>  An advantage of benzalkonium chloride, not shared by ethanol-based antiseptics or hydrogen peroxide antiseptic, is that it does not cause a burning sensation when applied to broken skin.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}},

Benzalkonium chloride has been in common use as a pharmaceutical preservative and antimicrobial since the 1940s. While early studies confirmed the corrosive and irritant properties of benzalkonium chloride, investigations into the adverse effects of, and disease states linked to, benzalkonium chloride have only surfaced during the past 30 years.

Benzalkonium chloride is classed as a Category III antiseptic active ingredient by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]]. Ingredients are categorised as Category III when "available data are insufficient to classify as safe and effective, and further testing is required”. Benzalkonium chloride is excluded from the current United States Food and Drug Administration review of the safety and effectiveness of consumer antiseptics and topical antimicrobial over-the-counter drug products, meaning it will remain a Category III ingredient.<ref name="FDAFederalRegister">{{cite web | title=Safety and Effectiveness of Consumer Antiseptics; Topical Antimicrobial Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use; Proposed Amendment of the Tentative Final Monograph; Reopening of Administrative Record | url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/12/17/2013-29814/safety-and-effectiveness-of-consumer-antiseptics-topical-antimicrobial-drug-products-for}}</ref> There is acknowledgement that more data are required on its safety, efficacy and effectiveness, especially with relation to:

* Human pharmacokinetic studies, including information on its metabolites
* Studies on animal absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion
* Data to help define the effect of formulation on dermal absorption
* Carcinogenicity

==Biological activity==
The greatest biocidal activity is associated with the C12 dodecyl & C14 [[1-Tetradecanol|myristyl]] alkyl derivatives. The mechanism of [[bactericide|bactericidal]]/[[microbicide|microbicidal]] action is thought to be due to disruption of intermolecular interactions. This can cause dissociation of [[cellular membrane]] [[lipid bilayer]]s, which compromises cellular permeability controls and induces leakage of cellular contents. Other biomolecular complexes within the bacterial cell can also undergo dissociation. [[Enzyme]]s, which finely control a wide range of respiratory and metabolic cellular activities, are particularly susceptible to deactivation. Critical intermolecular interactions and tertiary structures in such highly specific biochemical systems can be readily disrupted by cationic surfactants.

Benzalkonium chloride solutions are fast-acting biocidal agents with a moderately long duration of action. They are active against bacteria and some viruses, fungi, and protozoa. Bacterial spores are considered to be resistant. Solutions are [[bacteriostatic]] or [[bactericidal]] according to their concentration. [[Gram-positive]] bacteria are generally more susceptible than [[gram-negative]] bacteria. Activity is not greatly affected by pH, but increases substantially at higher temperatures and prolonged exposure times.

In a 1998 study utilizing the FDA protocol, a non-alcohol sanitizer with benzalkonium chloride as the active ingredient met the FDA performance standards, while [[Purell]], a popular alcohol-based sanitizer, did not. The study, which was undertaken and reported by a leading US developer, manufacturer and marketer of topical antimicrobial pharmaceuticals based on quaternary ammonium compounds, found that their own benzalkonium chloride-based sanitizer performed better than alcohol-based hand sanitizer after repeated use.<ref name=AORN>{{cite journal| title = Testing a New Alcohol-Free Hand Sanitizer to Combat Infection| last1 = Dyer| first1 = David| last2 = Gerenraich | first2 = Kenneth| last3 = Whams| first3 = Peter| location = AORN Journal Vol 68 Issue 2| year = 1998| pages = 239–251| url = http://www.aornjournal.org/article/S0001-2092%2806%2962517-9/abstract}}</ref>

Advancements in the quality and efficacy of benzalkonium chloride in current non-alcohol hand sanitizers has addressed the CDC concerns regarding gram negative bacteria, with the leading products being equal if not more effective against gram negative, particularly [[New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1]] and other antibiotic resistant bacteria.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Newer formulations using benzalkonium blended with various [[quaternary ammonium]] derivatives can be used to extend the biocidal spectrum and enhance the efficacy of benzalkonium based disinfection products.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} Formulation techniques have been used to great effect in enhancing the virucidal activity of quaternary ammonium-based disinfectants such as Virucide 100 to typical healthcare infection hazards such as [[hepatitis]] and [[HIV]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} The use of appropriate [[excipient]]s can also greatly enhance the spectrum, performance and [[detergent|detergency]], and prevent deactivation under use conditions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} Formulation can also help minimise deactivation of benzalkonium solutions  in the presence of organic and inorganic contamination.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Degradation==
[[File:Biodegradation pathways of BAC.jpg|thumb|Biodegradation Pathways of BAC with Fenton Process (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/Fe<sup>2+</sup>)<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title = Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients 6th Edition|last = Rowe|first = Raymond|publisher = Pharmaceutical Press|year = 2009|isbn = 978 1 58212 135 2|location = London, UK|pages = 56–58}}</ref>]]
Benzalkonium chloride degradation follows consecutive debenzylation, dealkylation, and demethylation steps producing [[benzyl chloride]], alkyl dimethyl amine, [[dimethyl amine]], long chain alkane, and [[ammonia]].<ref name=":0" /> The intermediates, major, and minor products can then be broken down into CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, NH<sub>3</sub>, and Cl<sup>–</sup>. The first step to the biodegradation of BAC is the fission or splitting of the alkyl chain from the quaternary nitrogen as shown in the diagram. This is done by abstracting the hydrogen from the alkyl chain by using a hydroxyl radical leading to a carbon centered radical. This results in benzyl dimethyl amine as the first intermediate and [[dodecanal]] as the major product.<ref name=":0" /> From here, benzyl dimethyl amine can be oxidized to benzoic acid using the Fenton process. The [[trimethyl amine]] group in [[dimethylbenzylamine]] can be cleaved to form a benzyl that can be further oxidized to [[benzoic acid]]. Benzoic acid uses [[hydroxylation]] (adding a hydroxyl group) to form [[p-hydroxybenzoic acid]]. Benzyldimethylamine can then be converted into ammonia by performing [[demethylation]] twice, which removes both methyl groups, followed by debenzylation, removing the benzyl group using [[hydrogenation]].<ref name=":0" /> The diagram represents suggested pathways of the biodegradation of BAC for both the hydrophobic and the hydrophilic regions of the surfactant. Since Stearalkonium chloride is a type of BAC, the biodegradation process should happen in the same manner.

==Regulation==
In September 2016, the FDA announced a ban on nineteen ingredients in consumer antibacterial soaps citing a lack of evidence for safety and effectiveness. A ban on three additional ingredients, including benzalkonium chloride, was deferred to allow ongoing studies to be completed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/06/2016-21337/safety-and-effectiveness-of-consumer-antiseptics-topical-antimicrobial-drug-products-for|title=Safety and Effectiveness of Consumer Antiseptics; Topical Antimicrobial Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use|date=2016-09-06|access-date=2016-10-05}}</ref>
