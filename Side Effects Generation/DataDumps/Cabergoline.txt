'''Cabergoline''' (brand names Dostinex and others), an [[ergot]] derivative, is a potent [[dopamine receptor]] [[agonist]] on [[Dopamine receptor D2|D<sub>2</sub> receptors]]. Rat studies show cabergoline has a direct [[inhibitory]] effect on [[pituitary]] [[lactotroph]] ([[prolactin]]) cells.<ref name="Dostinex at www.rxlist.com">{{cite web | url=http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/cabergoline.htm | title=Dostinex at www.rxlist.com | accessdate=2007-04-27 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070506113520/http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/cabergoline.htm | archivedate=2007-05-06 | df= }}</ref> It is frequently used as a first-line agent in the management of [[prolactinoma]]s due to its higher affinity for D<sub>2</sub> receptor sites, less severe side effects, and more convenient dosing schedule than the older [[bromocriptine]].

* adjunctive therapy of [[acromegaly]], cabergoline has low efficacy in suppressing growth hormone levels and is highly efficient in suppressing hyperprolactinemia that is present in 20-30% of acromegaly cases; [[growth hormone]] and [[prolactin]] are similar structurally and have similar effects in many target tissues, therefore targeting prolactin may help symptoms when growth hormone secretion can not be sufficiently controlled by other methods;

===Off-label===
It has at times been used as an adjunct to [[SSRI]] [[antidepressants]] as there is some evidence that it counteracts certain [[adverse effect|side effects]] of those [[drugs]], such as reduced [[libido]] and [[anorgasmia]]. It also has been suggested that it has a possible [[recreational]] use in reducing or eliminating the male [[refractory period (sex)|refractory period]], thereby  allowing men to experience multiple ejaculatory orgasms in rapid succession, and at least one scientific study supports those speculations.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Krüger TH, Haake P, Haverkamp J | title = Effects of acute prolactin manipulation on sexual drive and function in males | journal = [[Journal of Endocrinology]] | volume = 179 | issue = 3 | pages = 357–65 |date=December 2003 | pmid = 14656205 | doi = 10.1677/joe.0.1790357 | url = |display-authors=etal}}</ref> Additionally, a systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that prophylactic treatment with cabergoline reduces the incidence, but not the severity, of [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome]] (OHSS), without compromising pregnancy outcomes, in females undergoing stimulated cycles of [[in vitro fertilization]] ([[IVF]]).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Youssef MA, van Wely M, Hassan MA |title=Can dopamine agonists reduce the incidence and severity of OHSS in IVF/ICSI treatment cycles?

===Pregnancy and lactation===
Relatively little is known about the effects of this medication during pregnancy and lactation. In some cases the related [[bromocriptine]] may be an alternative when pregnancy is expected.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
* [[Pregnancy]]: available preliminary data indicates a somewhat increased rate of [[congenital]] abnormalities in patients who became pregnant while treated with cabergoline.{{Citation needed|reason=due to use as adjunct therapy with IVF, citation needed to clarify type of abnormalities, whether increase is meaningful, when treatment occurred, etc.|date=August 2011}}.  However, one study concluded that "foetal exposure to cabergoline through early pregnancy does not induce any increase in the risk of miscarriage or foetal malformation." <ref>{{cite journal|last=Colao|first=A|author2=Abs R.|title=Pregnancy outcomes following cabergoline treatment: extended results from a 12-year observational study|journal=Clinical Endocrinology|date=January 2008|volume=68|issue=1|pages=66–71|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2265.2007.03000.x|pmid=17760883|display-authors=etal}}</ref> 
* [[Lactation]]: In rats cabergoline was found in the maternal [[milk]]. Since it is not known if this effect also occurs in humans, breastfeeding is usually not recommended if/when treatment with cabergoline is necessary.
* [[Lactation suppression]]: In some countries cabergoline (Dostinex) is sometimes used as a lactation suppressant. It is also used in veterinary medicine to treat [[false pregnancy]] in dogs.

==Contraindications and precautions==
* [[Hypersensitivity]] to [[ergot]] [[derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]]
* [[Pediatric]] patients (no clinical experience)
* Severely impaired liver function or [[cholestasis]]
* [[Co-medication]] with drugs metabolized mainly by CYP P450 such as [[erythromycin]] and [[ketoconazole]], because increased [[blood plasma|plasma]] levels of cabergoline may result (although cabergoline undergoes minimal CYP450 metabolism).
* Cautions: severe [[cardiovascular disease]], [[Raynaud's disease]], [[Peptic ulcer|gastroduodenal ulcers]], active gastrointestinal bleeding, [[hypotension]].

==Side effects==
Side effects are mostly dose dependent. Much more severe side effects are reported for treatment of Parkinson's disease and (off-label treatment) for [[restless leg syndrome]] which both typically require very high doses. The side effects are considered mild when used for treatment of hyperprolactinemia and other endocrine disorders or gynecologic indications where the typical dose is one hundredthe to one tenth that for Parkinson's disease.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Cabergoline requires slow dose titration (2–4 weeks for hyperprolactinemia, often much longer for other conditions) to minimise side effects. The extremely long bioavailability of the medication may complicate dosing regimens during titration and require particular precautions.

Cabergoline is considered the best tolerable option for hyperprolactinemia treatment although the newer and less tested [[quinagolide]] may offer similarly favourable side effect profile with quicker titration times.

Approximately 200 patients with newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease participated in a [[Clinical trial|clinical study]] of cabergoline monotherapy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Seventy-nine (79) percent reported at least one side effect. These side effects were chiefly mild or moderate:
* GI tract: Side effects were extremely frequent. Fifty-three percent of patients reported side effects.  Very frequent: [[Nausea]] (30%), [[constipation]] (22%), and dry mouth (10%). Frequent:  Gastric irritation (7%), [[vomiting]] (5%), and [[dyspepsia]] (2%).
* [[psychiatry|Psychiatric]] disturbances and [[central nervous system]] (CNS): Altogether 51 percent of patients were affected.  Very frequent: Sleep disturbances ([[somnolence]] 18%, [[insomnia]] 11%), [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]] (27%), and [[Clinical depression|depression]] (13%). Frequent: [[dyskinesia]] (4%) and [[hallucinations]] (4%).
* Cardiovascular: Approximately 30 percent of patients experienced side effects. Most frequent were hypotension (10%), peripheral [[edema]] (14%) and non-specific edema (2%). [[Arrhythmias]] were encountered in 4.8%, [[palpitations]] in 4.3%, and [[angina pectoris]] in 1.4%.

In a combination study with 2,000 patients also treated with levodopa, the incidence and severity of side effects was comparable to monotherapy. Encountered side effects required a termination of cabergoline treatment in 15% of patients. Additional side effects were infrequent cases of [[hematology|hematological]] side effects, and an occasional increase in liver [[enzymes]] or [[Blood serum|serum]] [[creatinine]] without [[Medical sign|sign]]s or [[symptoms]].

As with other ergot derivatives, [[pleuritis]], [[exudative]] pleura disease, pleura [[fibrosis]], [[lung]] fibrosis, and [[pericarditis]] are seen. These side effects are noted in less than 2% of patients. They require immediate termination of treatment. Clinical improvement and normalization of [[X-ray]] findings are normally seen soon after cabergoline [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]]. It appears that the dose typically used for treatment of hyperprolactinemia is too low to cause this type of side effects.

===Valvular heart disease===
In two studies published in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' on January 4, 2007, cabergoline was implicated along with [[pergolide]] in causing [[valvular heart disease]].<ref>{{Cite journal| last1=Schade| first1=Rene| last2=Andersohn |first2=Frank |last3=Suissa |first3=Samy |last4=Haverkamp |first4=Wilhelm |last5=Garbe |first5=Edeltraut |title=Dopamine Agonists and the Risk of Cardiac-Valve Regurgitation |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=356 |issue=1 |pages=29–38 |date=2007-01-04 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/356/1/29 |doi= 10.1056/NEJMoa062222|id=| pmid=17202453| postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| last1=Zanettini| first1=Renzo| last2=Antonini |first2=Angelo |last3=Gatto |first3=Gemma |last4=Gentile |first4=Rosa |last5=Tesei |first5=Silvana |last6=Pezzoli |first6=Gianna |title=Valvular Heart Disease and the Use of Dopamine Agonists for Parkinson's Disease |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=356 |issue=1 |pages=39–46 |date=2007-01-04 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/356/1/39 |doi= 10.1056/NEJMoa054830|id=| pmid=17202454| postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>  As a result of this, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] removed pergolide from the U.S. market on March 29, 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/advisory/pergolide.htm |title=Food and Drug Administration Public Health Advisory |date=2007-03-29 |accessdate=2007-04-27 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070408111551/http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/advisory/pergolide.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-04-08}}</ref>  Since cabergoline is not approved in the U.S. for Parkinson's Disease, but for hyperprolactinemia, the drug remains on the market.

==Interactions==
No [[drug interaction|interactions]] were noted with levodopa or [[selegiline]]. The drug should not be combined with other ergot derivatives. Dopamine [[Receptor antagonist|antagonists]] such as [[antipsychotics]] and [[metoclopramide]] counteract some effects of cabergoline. The use of [[antihypertensive]] drugs should be intensively monitored because excessive hypotension may result from the combination.

==Pharmacology==
Although cabergoline is commonly described principally as a dopamine [[Dopamine receptor D2|D<sub>2</sub> receptor]] agonist, it also possesses significant affinity for the [[Dopamine receptor D3|D<sub>3</sub>]], [[Dopamine receptor D4|D<sub>4</sub>]], [[5-HT1A|5-HT<sub>1A</sub>]], [[5-HT2A|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]], [[5-HT2B|5-HT<sub>2B</sub>]], [[5-HT2C|5-HT<sub>2C</sub>]], [[α2B-adrenergic|α<sub>2B</sub>-]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s, and moderate/low affinity for the [[Dopamine receptor D1|D<sub>1</sub>]] and [[5-HT7|5-HT<sub>7</sub>]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s. Cabergoline functions as an agonist at all of these receptors except for [[5-HT7|5-HT<sub>7</sub>]] and [[α2B-adrenergic|α<sub>2B</sub>-]], where it acts as an antagonist.<ref name="pmid18992242">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sharif NA, McLaughlin MA, Kelly CR, Katoli P, Drace C, Husain S, Crosson C, Toris C, Zhan GL, Camras C | title = Cabergoline: Pharmacology, ocular hypotensive studies in multiple species, and aqueous humor dynamic modulation in the Cynomolgus monkey eyes | journal = [[Experimental Eye Research]] | volume = 88 | issue = 3 | pages = 386–97 |date=March 2009 | pmid = 18992242 | doi = 10.1016/j.exer.2008.10.003 | url = }}</ref>

==Pharmacokinetics==
Following a single oral [[Dose (biochemistry)|dose]], resorption of cabergoline from the [[gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal (GI) tract]] is highly variable, typically occurring within 0.5 to 4 hours. Ingestion with [[food]] does not alter its absorption rate. [[Human]] [[bioavailability]] has not been determined since the drug is intended for oral use only.  In [[mice]] and [[rat]]s the absolute bioavailability has been determined to be 30 and 63 percent, respectively.  Cabergoline is rapidly and extensively [[metabolism|metabolized]] in the [[liver]] and excreted in [[bile]] and to a lesser extent in [[urine]]. All [[metabolites]] are less active than the parental drug or inactive altogether. The human elimination [[half life|half-life]] is estimated to be 63 to 68 hours in patients with [[Parkinson's disease]] and 79 to 115 hours in patients with [[pituitary gland|pituitary]] [[tumor]]s. Average elimination [[half life|half-life]] is 80 hours.

The therapeutic effect in treatment of hyperprolactinemia will typically persist for at least 4 weeks after cessation of treatment.

==Mechanism of action==
Cabergoline is a long-acting dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor agonist and in vitro rat studies show a direct inhibitory effect on the prolactin secretion in the pituitary's lactotroph cells. Cabergoline decreased serum prolactin levels in [[reserpine|reserpinized]] rats.

Receptor binding studies indicate a low affinity for dopamine [[Dopamine receptor D1|D<sub>1</sub> receptors]], α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors, and α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors.<ref name="Dostinex at www.rxlist.com"/>

==Research==
Cabergoline was studied in one person with [[Cushing's disease]], to lower [[ACTH]] levels and cause regression of ACTH producing pituitary adenomas.<ref>{{Cite journal| pmid = 15754738| year = 2004| last1 = Miyoshi | first1 = T.| title = Effect of cabergoline treatment on Cushing's disease caused by aberrant adrenocorticotropin-secreting macroadenoma| volume = 27| issue = 11| pages = 1055–1059| journal = Journal of endocrinological investigation|display-authors=etal| doi=10.1007/bf03345309}}</ref>
