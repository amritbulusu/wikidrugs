==Medical use==
Mebendazole is a highly effective, broad-spectrum [[antihelmintic]] indicated for the treatment of [[nematode]] infestations, including roundworm, hookworm, whipworm, threadworm, pinworm, and the intestinal form of [[trichinosis]] prior to its spread into the tissues beyond the digestive tract. Other drugs are used to treat worm infections outside the digestive tract, as mebendazole is poorly absorbed into the bloodstream.<ref name = "Goodman">Petri WA in Brunton LL, Chabner BA, Knollmann BC, Ed. Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 12th ed., Chapter 42. McGraw-Hill, 2011 New York.</ref> Mebendazole is used alone in those with mild to moderate infestations.  It kills parasites relatively slowly, and in those with very heavy infestations, it can cause some parasites to migrate out of the digestive system, leading to appendicitis, bile duct problems, or intestinal perforation.  To avoid this, heavily infested patients may be treated with piperazine, either before or instead of mebendazole.  [[Piperazine]] paralyses the parasites, causing them to pass in the feces.<ref>Martin AR in Wilson and Gisvold's Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, 8th edition, Doerge RF, ed. J.B. Lippincott, 1982, Chapter 4</ref> It is also used rarely in the treatment of hydatid disease. Evidence for effectiveness for this disease, however, is poor.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mebendazole|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/mebendazole.html|website=drugs.com|accessdate=25 January 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222112913/http://www.drugs.com/monograph/mebendazole.html|archivedate=22 February 2015|df=}}</ref>

Mebendazole and other benzimidazole antithelmetics are active against both larval and adult stages of nematodes, and in the cases of roundworm and whipworm, kill the eggs, as well. Paralysis and death of the parasites occurs slowly, and elimination in the feces may require several days.<ref name = Goodman />

===Special populations===
Mebendazole is pregnancy category C, which means  it has been shown to cause ill effects in pregnancy in animal models, and no adequate studies of its effects in human pregnancy have been conducted. Whether it can be passed by breastfeeding is unknown.<ref name = Harrison>Finberg R, Fingeroth J in Longo DL, Fauci AS, Kasper DL, Hauser SL, Jameson JL, Loscalzo, Ed. Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 18th ed., McGraw-Hill, 2012, Chapter 217.</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Mebendazole sometimes causes diarrhea, abdominal pain, and elevated liver enzymes.  In rare cases, it has been associated with a dangerously low white blood cell count, [[thrombocytopenia|low platelet count]], and hair loss,<ref name = Harrison /><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Andersohn F, Konzen C, Garbe E |title=Systematic review: agranulocytosis induced by nonchemotherapy drugs |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=146 |issue=9 |pages=657–65 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17470834 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-146-9-200705010-00009 |url=http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=734449 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108042837/http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=734449 |archivedate=2014-01-08 |df= }}</ref> with a risk of [[agranulocytosis]] in rare cases

===Drug interactions===
[[Carbamazepine]] and [[phenytoin]] lower serum levels of mebendazole. [[Cimetidine]] does not appreciably raise serum mebendazole (in contrast to the similar drug [[albendazole]]), consistent with its poor systemic absorption.<ref>{{cite web |title       = Drug Interactions |url         = http://www.medicinechestonline.co.uk/static/professional2/drug_interactions.htm |publisher   = Medicine chest |accessdate  = 2008-05-06 |deadurl     = no |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070206161215/http://www.medicinechestonline.co.uk/static/professional2/drug_interactions.htm |archivedate = 2007-02-06 |df          = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | author = Luder PJ, Siffert B, Witassek F, Meister F, Bircher J| title = Treatment of hydatid disease with high oral doses of mebendazole.

[[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]] and the more severe [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]] can occur when mebendazole is combined with high doses of [[metronidazole]].<ref name="pmid12604501">{{Cite journal |author1=Chen, K.

==Mechanism==
Mebendazole is thought to work by selectively inhibiting the synthesis of microtubules in parasitic worms, and by destroying extant cytoplasmic microtubules in their intestinal cells, thereby blocking the uptake of glucose and other nutrients, resulting in the gradual immobilization and eventual death of the helminths.<ref name = Goodman />

==Society and culture==

===Cost===
Mebendazole is available as a [[generic medication]].<ref name=Ric2012/> The wholesale cost is between 0.004 and 0.04 USD per dose.<ref name=GlobP2014/> In the United States a single dose is about 18 USD.<ref name=AHFS2015/>

As of 2016, pricing has dramatically increased in the U.S. as Amedra Pharmaceuticals acquired the rights to this drug from Teva in 2013.  It should also be noted that in 2010, Amedra also bought the U.S. Marketing rights to the only other interchangeable anti-parasitic medication, albendazole, from GSK.  The result of these acquisitions created a monopoly for this 40+ year old medication and its alternative medication.<ref>High-Cost Generic Drugs — Implications for Patients and Policymakers

N Engl J Med 2014; 371:1859-1862</ref> The retail price was approximately 380 USD per 100&nbsp;mg tablet in Florida in September, 2016, and marketed under the brand name, Emverm, by Amedra Pharmaceuticals. In Taiwan, a package of 10 capsules (100 mg) sells for $3 US dollars.

=== Availability ===
Mebendazole is distributed in international markets by [[Johnson and Johnson]] and a number of generic manufacturers.<ref>{{Citation
