'''Cyclopentolate''' is a medication commonly used during [[pediatric]] [[eye examination]]s that dilates the eye ([[mydriatic]]), prevents [[Accommodation (eye)|accommodation]] of the eye to different distances ([[cycloplegia|cycloplegic]]), and blocks specific receptors called [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor|muscarinic receptors]] ([[muscarinic antagonist]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00979|title=Cyclopentolate|accessdate=June 15, 2012}}</ref>  Cyclopentolate is also administered as an [[atropine]] substitute to reverse muscarinic and central nervous system effects of indirect [[cholinomimetic]] (anti-AChase) administration.

When used in eye drops in paediatric eye examinations, cyclopentolate 0.5 percent and 1.0 percent is used to stop the eye focusing at any distance closer than infinity. This enables the [[ophthalmologist]] or [[optometrist]] to obtain a more accurate reading of the correcting lenses required for clear vision at distance. Brand names include Cyclogyl, Cylate, Mydrilate, and Pentolair.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/cyclopentolate_hydrochloride-eye_drops/article.htm|title=cyclopentolate hydrochloride solution - ophthalmic, Cyclogyl, Cylate, Pentolair|accessdate=June 15, 2012}}</ref>

Cyclopentolate drops act rapidly to dilate the pupil.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/profs/Datasheet/c/Cyclogyleyedrop.pdf|title=Cyclogyl Eye Drops Medsafe data sheet New Zealand|last=|first=|date=11 January 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 June 2017}}</ref> They have a shorter half-life than atropine. Pupil dilation can last up to 96 hours, with patients advised not to drive a vehicle or operate machinery for at least 12 hours. The pupils become wider when cyclopentolate is administered, making the eyes more sensitive to light. Close objects (and possibly distant objects) will also appear blurred.

Side effects to cyclopentolate are rare, but can include effects such as disorientation, incoherent speech or visual disturbances during the 24-hour period that the drug has an effect. The side effects are more common in children.
