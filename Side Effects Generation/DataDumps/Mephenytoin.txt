'''Mephenytoin''' (marketed as '''Mesantoin''' by Novartis) is a [[hydantoin]], used as an [[anticonvulsant]]. It was introduced approximately 10 years after [[phenytoin]], in the late 1940s. The significant [[metabolite]] of mephenytoin is [[nirvanol]] (5-ethyl-5-phenylhydantoin), which was the first hydantoin (briefly used as a [[hypnotic]]). However, nirvanol is quite toxic and mephenytoin was only considered after other less toxic anticonvulsants had failed. It can cause potentially fatal blood [[dyscrasia]] in 1% of patients.

Mephenytoin is no longer available in the US or the UK. It is still studied largely because of its interesting [[hydroxylation]] [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]].
