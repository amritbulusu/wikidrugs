==Medical uses==
Ritonavir is used along with other medications to treat [[HIV/AIDS]].<ref name=AHFS2015/>

==Side effects==
When administered at doses effective for anti-HIV therapy, the side effects of ritonavir are those shown below.  It is currently (2015) much more widely used at lower doses as a pharmacokinetic inhibitor.  The adverse effects of these lower doses of ritonavir do not appear to have been extensively characterized.<ref>[http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/ritonavirsol_ad.htm Norvir] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627024638/http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/ritonavirsol_ad.htm |date=2007-06-27 }}, rxlist.com</ref>

* dizziness
* insomnia
* sweating
* taste abnormality
* metabolic
** [[hypercholesterolemia]]
** [[hypertriglyceridemia]]
** elevated [[transaminase]]s
** elevated [[Creatine kinase|CPK]]

One of ritonavir's side effects is [[hyperglycemia]]. It appears that ritonavir directly inhibits the [[GLUT4]] insulin-regulated transporter, keeping glucose from entering fat and muscle cells.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}  This can lead to [[insulin resistance]] and cause problems for people with [[type Ⅱ diabetes]]. The capsules of the medication do not have the same bioavailability as the tablets.<ref name=AHFS2015/>

==Mechanism of action==
[[Image:HIV protesase with ritonavir.png|Ritonavir (center) bound to the active site of HIV protease.|200px|thumb|left]]

Ritonavir was originally developed as an [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] of [[HIV protease]]. It is one of the most complex inhibitors. It is now rarely used for its own antiviral activity, but remains widely used as a booster of other [[Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitor]]s. More specifically, ritonavir is used to inhibit a particular liver enzyme that normally [[metabolize]]s protease inhibitors, [[CYP3A4|cytochrome P450-3A4]] (CYP3A4).<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/53/1/4 |vauthors=Zeldin RK, Petruschke RA |title=Pharmacological and therapeutic properties of ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor therapy in HIV-infected patients |journal=[[Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy]] |volume=53 |pages=4–9 |year=2004 |doi=10.1093/jac/dkh029 |pmid=14657084 |issue=1 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821190515/http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/53/1/4 |archivedate=2007-08-21 |df= }}</ref> The drug's molecular structure inhibits CYP3A4, so a low dose can be used to enhance other protease inhibitors.  This discovery, which has drastically reduced the adverse effects and improved the efficacy of protease inhibitors and HAART, was first communicated in an article published in the journal [[AIDS (journal)|''AIDS'']] in 1997 by researchers at the [[University of Liverpool]].<ref>{{cite journal | journal = AIDS | year = 1997 | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = F29–F33 | url = http://www.aidsonline.com/pt/re/aids/fulltext.00002030-199704000-00001.htm;jsessionid=GzjRLZg2JD63hFQWx2LLZVLJzWLGwz72zpQ290nsQ4FywKbR5X5h!3145886!-949856145!8091!-1 | title = Saquinavir pharmacokinetics alone and in combination with ritonavir in HIV-infected patients |author1=Merry, Concepta |author2=Barry, Michael G. |author3=Mulcahy, Fiona |author4=Ryan, Mairin |author5=Heavey, Jane |author6=Tjia, John F. |author7=Gibbons, Sara E. |author8=Breckenridge, Alasdair M. |authorlink8=Alasdair Breckenridge |author9=Back, David J. | doi = 10.1097/00002030-199704000-00001 | pmid = 9084785}}</ref>  This effect does come with a price: it also affects the efficacy of numerous other medications, making it difficult to know how to administer them concurrently.

==History==
[[File:HIV new infections and deaths 1981-2008.jpg|thumb|alt=United States HIV new infections and HIV deaths before and after the FDA approval of ritonavir.|HIV deaths in the United States fell from approximately 50,000 per year to 18,000 in the two years following the FDA approval of ritonavir<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/wk/mm6021.pdf|title=www.cdc.gov|format=|work=|accessdate=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924044850/http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/wk/mm6021.pdf|archivedate=2015-09-24|df=}}</ref>]]
Ritonavir is manufactured as Norvir by [[AbbVie|AbbVie, Inc.]]. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved ritonavir on March 1, 1996, making it the seventh approved antiretroviral drug and the second approved protease inhibitor in the United States.  Within 2 years of the approval of ritonavir (and of saquinavir a few months earlier), the U.S. HIV-associated death rate fell from over 50,000 per year to about 18,000.<ref>{{Cite web | title = HIV Surveillance --- United States, 1981--2008 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6021a2.htm | publisher =  | accessdate = 8 November 2013 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131109001606/http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6021a2.htm | archivedate = 9 November 2013 | df =  }}</ref>

In 2003, Abbott (now AbbVie, Inc.) raised the price of a Norvir course from [[United States dollar|USD]] $1.71 per day to $8.57 per day, leading to claims of [[price gouging]] by patients' groups and some members of Congress. Consumer group [[Essential Inventions]] petitioned the NIH to override the Norvir patent, but the NIH announced on August 4, 2004 that it lacked the legal right to allow generic production of Norvir.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A40430-2004Aug4.html| title=NIH Declines to Enter AIDS Drug Price Battle| accessdate=2006-01-16| author=Ceci Connolly| publisher=Washington Post| date=2004-08-05| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820201659/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A40430-2004Aug4.html| archivedate=2008-08-20| df=}}</ref>

==Polymorphism and temporary market withdrawal==
Ritonavir was originally dispensed as an ordinary capsule, which did not require refrigeration. This was as a crystal of what is now called form I.<ref name="bauer">{{cite journal |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/k655264600tjh122/ |author=Bauer J|title=Ritonavir: An Extraordinary Example of Conformational Polymorphism |journal=Pharmaceutical Research |volume=18 |pages=859–866 |year=2001 |doi=10.1023/A:1011052932607 |pmid=11474792 |issue=6 |name-list-format=vanc|display-authors=etal}}</ref> However, like many drugs, ritonavir exhibits [[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphism]], i.e., the same molecule crystallizes into more than one type of crystal. The different crystals, or polymorphs, are made of the same molecules but in different crystalline arrangements. The solubility and hence the [[bioavailability]] is very different in the two different arrangements.<ref name="morissette">{{cite journal |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/100/5/2180.long/ |author1=S. L. Morissette |author2=S. Soukasene |author3=D. Levinson |author4=M. J. Cima |author5=O. Almarsson |title=Elucidation of crystal form diversity of the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir by high-throughput crystallization |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA |volume=100 |pages=2180–84 |year=2003 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0437744100 |pmid=12604798 |issue=5 |pmc=151315 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160929071342/http://www.pnas.org/content/100/5/2180.long |archivedate=2016-09-29 |df= }}</ref>

During development (it was introduced in 1996), only the polymorph now called form I was found, but in 1998, a lower free energy, more stable polymorph (form II) appeared. This more stable (and so less soluble) crystal form compromised the oral bioavailability of the drug. This caused the removal of the oral capsule formulation from the market.<ref name="morissette"/>

Even a trace of form II can catalyse the transformation from the more bioavailable form I to form II.
Thus form II threatened existing supplies of ritonavir as the lower solubility polymorph caused the therapeutically effective polymorph to convert to form II. Form II, which was not therapeutically effective because of poor solubility and resulting much lower [[bioavailability]], entered production lines and effectively halted production processes.<ref name="bauer"/>

After this discovery in the late 1990s, Abbott (now AbbVie) withdrew the original capsules from the market, and recommended people switch to Norvir suspension while researchers worked to solve the problem. The capsules have been replaced with refrigerated gelcaps, to solve the crystallization problem of the original capsules.

In 2000 Abbott (now AbbVie) was awarded approval by the FDA for a tablet (called [[lopinavir/ritonavir]]) which contains ritonavir that does not require refrigeration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kaletra.com/information/FAQ.aspx |title=KALETRA FAQ |date=2011 |website=AbbVie's Kaletra product information |publisher=AbbVie |accessdate=5 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140707075122/http://www.kaletra.com/information/FAQ.aspx |archivedate=7 July 2014 |df= }}</ref>
