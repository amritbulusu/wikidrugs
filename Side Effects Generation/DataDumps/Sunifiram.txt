==Pharmacology==
The [[mechanism of action]] of sunifiram is unknown.<ref name="pmid25831025" /> Sunifiram, as well as unifiram, were assayed at a wide panel of sites, including the most important [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s, [[ion channel]]s, and [[membrane transport protein|transporter]]s, but showed no [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for any of the sites.<ref name="pmid25831025">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gualtieri F | title = Unifi nootropics from the lab to the web: a story of academic (and industrial) shortcomings | journal = J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–94 | year = 2016 | pmid = 25831025 | doi = 10.3109/14756366.2015.1021252 | url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid16834757">{{cite journal | vauthors = Romanelli MN, Galeotti N, Ghelardini C, Manetti D, Martini E, Gualtieri F | title = Pharmacological characterization of DM232 (unifiram) and DM235 (sunifiram), new potent cognition enhancers | journal = CNS Drug Rev | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 39–52 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16834757 | doi = 10.1111/j.1527-3458.2006.00039.x | url = }}</ref> They specifically did not bind to the [[glutamate receptor|glutamate]], [[GABA receptor|GABA]], [[serotonin receptor|serotonin]], [[dopamine receptor|dopamine]], [[adrenergic receptor|adrenergic]], [[histamine receptor|histamine]], [[acetylcholine receptor|acetylcholine]], or [[opioid receptor]]s at concentrations of up to 1&nbsp;μM.<ref name="pmid25831025" /><ref name="pmid16834757" /> In addition, the drugs were tested on recombinant [[AMPA receptor]]s and showed no potentiation of the receptors, indicating that they do not act as [[AMPA receptor positive allosteric modulator]]s.<ref name="pmid25831025" /> However, they were able to prevent the [[amnesia]] induced by the AMPA receptor [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] [[NBQX]] in the passive avoidance test, suggesting that [[upstream and downstream (transduction)|indirect/downstream]] AMPA receptor activation may be involved in their memory-enhancing effects.<ref name="pmid16834757" />

Sunifiram, as well as other nootropics such as piracetam, [[levetiracetam]], and [[aniracetam]] are able to antagonize inhibition of [[glucose]] transport by [[barbiturate]]s (e.g., [[pentobarbital]]), [[diazepam]], and certain other drugs in human [[erythrocyte]]s ''[[in vitro]]'' (K<sub>i</sub> = 26.0&nbsp;uM for sunifiram), and this action has been found to correlate with their potency in reversing [[scopolamine]]-induced memory deficits in mice.<ref name="pmid16834757" /> However, this action has been regarded as very unlikely to represent the main mechanism of action of sunifiram.<ref name="pmid25831025" />
