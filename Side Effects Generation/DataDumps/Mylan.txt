In 2016, Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen, an [[epinephrine autoinjector]], became controversial and was widely referred to as "price gouging".  As a result, investigations were opened into whether Mylan had misclassified the EpiPen under the [[Medicaid Drug Rebate Program]], a common form of [[pharmaceutical fraud]].  In October 2016, Mylan settled these investigations with the U.S. Department of Justice, agreeing to pay $465 million and enter into a corporate integrity agreement concerning the rebate program. In a report published on June 12, 2017 the Institutional Shareholder Services criticized Mylan for the "outsized compensation" of Mylan's directors. Former CEO [[Robert Coury]] received a "$98 million" 2016 "pay package" in spite of the "harm to the company inflicted by the EpiPen controversies" and "steep shareholder losses." The report urged Mylan's shareholders to "oust all of Mylan's existing directors".<ref name="CNN_CEO_revolt">{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/13/investing/epipen-mylan-exec-pay-shareholder-revolt/index.html?sr=twCNN061417epipen-mylan-exec-pay-shareholder-revolt0246AMStoryLink&linkId=38675750 |title=EpiPen maker faces revolt over exec's $98 million pay package |first=Matt |last=Egan |work=CNN Money}}</ref>

==History==

Mylan Pharmaceuticals was founded as a drug distributor in 1961 by [[Milan Puskar]] and [[Don Panoz]].<ref name="PuskarObit"/> In 1966 Mylan began manufacturing [[penicillin G]] tablets as well as vitamins and other dietary supplements.<ref name="PuskarObit"/><ref name=NYTexpose1989/>

Panoz left Mylan in 1969 and Puskar quit the company in 1973, as it grew and experienced financial difficulties; the board hired Roy McKnight as board chairman, who convinced Puskar to return in 1976.<ref name=NYTexpose1989/>

Mylan discontinued operating as a [[contract manufacturing organization]] in 1980 and instead chose to market their products under their own "Mylan-labeled" brand.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

With the passage of the [[Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act|Hatch-Waxman Act]] in 1984, Mylan and other small generic companies gained value; in the eighteen months following passage of the law Mylan's earnings grew 166% to $12.5 million and its stock value rose 800%.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=Ralph A.|title=The Emerging Effects of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984|journal=Journal of Contemporary Health Law & Policy|date=1992|volume=8|issue=1|pages=361‚Äì378|url=http://scholarship.law.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1539&context=jchlp}}</ref>

In the 1980s one of the most prescribed drugs in the US was Dyazide, a [[diuretic]] that was a [[combination drug]] containing [[triamterene]] and [[hydrochlorothiazide]]; it had been on the market since 1965 and its patents had expired in 1980.<ref name=Philly1987>Ron Wolf for the Philadelphia Inquirer.

Some generic companies committed fraud trying to bring a generic version of Dyazide.  Bolar Pharmaceutical had the first generic version approved in 1987,<ref name=Philly1987/>  but it turned out that Bolar had fraudulently substituted Dyazide for its own version to conduct studies that were submitted to the FDA. By 1989 the FDA rescinded its approval based on its suspicions and filed criminal charges against Bolar, to which Bolar eventually pled guilty in 1991.<ref name=Siege/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Shaw|first1=Donna|title=U.s.

Mylan chose to develop a new version of a triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide combination drug instead of going the generic route;  it developed a different, more stable formulation<ref name=MylanHistDyazide/> and used different dosages of each active ingredient (50&nbsp;mg hydrochlorothiazide and 75&nbsp;mg triamterene, compared with Dyazide's 25&nbsp;mg hydrochlorothiazide and 50&nbsp;mg triamterene).<ref name=MaxApprovable/> This drug had to get approval as a new drug, as opposed to a generic; their product was called Maxzide and was approved in 1984.<ref name=MaxApprovable>Pink Sheet October 22, 1984 [https://pink.pharmamedtechbi.com/PS007364/MYLANs-MAXZIDE-IS-APPROVABLE-AT-FDA-LEDERLE-TO-MARKET-BRAND-COMPETITION-TO-SMITHKLINEs-No-3RANKED-DYAZIDE-FINAL-APPROVAL-ANTICIPATED-IMMINENTLY Mylan's Maxzide is "Approvable" at FDA: Lederle To Market Brand Competition to Smithkline's No. 3-Ranked Dyazide; Final Approval Anticipated "Imminently"]</ref><ref>FDA [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.Set_Current_Drug&ApplNo=019129&DrugName=MAXZIDE&ActiveIngred=HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE%3B%20TRIAMTERENE&SponsorApplicant=MYLAN%20PHARMS%20INC&ProductMktStatus=1&goto=Search.Label_ApprovalHistory Approval History NDA 019129: Maxzide] Page accessed September 8, 2016</ref>  The higher dose allowed once per day dosing, which Mylan and its marketing partner, Lederle, believed would help it compete against Dyazide, which had $210M in sales in 1983.<ref name=MaxApprovable/>  However, Mylan's patents on the drug were declared invalid in court, and its marketing exclusivity expired in 1987, prompting a rush of generic competition<ref>{{cite news|last1=Reid|first1=Kenneth|title=US Judge to Rule on Drug Marketing|url=http://www.joc.com/us-judge-rule-drug-marketing_19871117.html|publisher=Journal of Commerce|date=November 17, 1987}}</ref>

Mylan had concerns about the practices of its competitors and the FDA in general, and also with regard to companies seeking to bring generic versions of Maxzide.  Mylan hired private investigators to examine its competitors' practices, and when it found evidence of corruption, it submitted it to the [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations|House Oversight and Investigations Committee]], which investigated and found fraud and corruption within the [[Food and Drug Administration]]'s generic drugs division and at other generic companies.<ref name=NYTexpose1989>{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/10/business/exposing-the-fda.html?pagewanted=all|title = Exposing the F.D.A.|last = Freudenheim|first = Milt|date = September 10, 1989|work = New York Times|accessdate = }}</ref>  Two of the companies that had gotten approval to market generic versions of Maxzide,  Vitarine Pharmaceutical and [[Par Pharmaceutical]], were targets of Mylan's initial investigation and were found to have used Mylan's Maxzide to obtain their bioequivalence data, leading both companies to withdraw its generic competitor to Mylan's product.<ref name=NYTexpose1989/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Andrews|first1=Edmund L.|title=F.D.A.

The corruption in the nascent generics industry and at the office in the FDA regulating it was widely covered in the media, and led to widespread concern among doctors and the public in the late 1980s and early 1990s that generic drugs were not really the same as the branded drugs they were meant to replace.<ref name=Siege>{{cite news|last1=Strickland|first1=Carol|title=Bolar: A Drug Company Under Siege|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/15/nyregion/bolar-a-drug-company-under-siege.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|date=October 15, 1989}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Cimons|first1=Marlene|title=FDA to Lift OK of Last Dyazide Generic Version|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-08-29/news/mn-1184_1_generic-drug|work=Los Angeles Times|date=August 29, 1989}}</ref><ref name="auto"/>

In 1987 Mylan agreed to enter into a joint venture with Bolar to buy Somerset Pharmaceuticals; Mylan wanted access to Somersets' drug discovery capabilities as well as its new drug for Parkinson's, [[selegiline]]; the deal was completed in 1988 but its consummation was dependent on FDA approval of selegiline, which came in 1989.<ref name=NYTexpose1989/><ref>{{cite news|title=Bolar and Mylan Team to Purchase Somerset Labs|url=https://pink.pharmamedtechbi.com/PS014590/BOLAR-AND-MYLAN-TEAM-TO-PURCHASE-SOMERSET-LABS|work=Pink Sheet|date=November 14, 1988}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Somerset Eldepryl June 5 Approval Clears Way For Mylan/Bolar Acquisition|url=https://pink.pharmamedtechbi.com/PS015763/SOMERSET-ELDEPRYL-JUNE-5-APPROVAL-CLEARS-WAY-FOR-MYLANBOLAR-ACQUISITION|work=Pink Sheet|date=June 12, 1989}}</ref>

In 1998 when it was the world's second largest generics company, Mylan came under investigation from the [[Federal Trade Commission]] after it raised the prices of its products, tripling them in the case of [[lorazepam]];  Mylan had entered into an exclusive agreement with Profarmica, an Italian company that supplied drug ingredients, after which Mylan's competitors had higher prices and a diminished supply of raw ingredients for lorazepam and other drugs.<ref name="NYT1998">{{cite news|last1=Labaton|first1=Stephen|title=A Drug Maker Is Said to Face A Suit on Prices|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/05/business/a-drug-maker-is-said-to-face-a-suit-on-prices.html|work=The New York Times|date=December 5, 1998}}</ref> Before the round of price increases the price of generic drugs had been 5 - 10% of the price of branded drugs and afterwards it was around 50%.<ref name="NYT1998"/>  The FTC filed suit at the end of 1998 and 32 states filed parallel actions;  the case was settled in 2000, with Mylan paying a total of $147M --  $100M in disgorged profits into a fund to reimburse consumers and state agencies that had overpaid, $8 million in attorney's fees to the State Attorneys General, $35 million, plus $4 million in attorney's fees, to settle certain class actions with insurers and managed care organizations‚Äîand Mylan and three ingredient suppliers (Cambrex Corporation, Profarmaco S.R.L., and Gyma Laboratories) also agreed to an injunction barring them from entering into similar anticompetitive agreements in the future.<ref>{{cite news|title=Press release: FTC Reaches Record Financial Settlement To Settle Charges of Price-fixing in Generic Drug Market {{!}} Federal Trade Commission|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2000/11/ftc-reaches-record-financial-settlement-settle-charges-price|work=FTC|date=November 29, 2000}}</ref><ref name = "nyt">

In December 2012, the [[National Association of State Boards of Education]] launched a policy initiative designed to "help state boards of education as they develop student health policies regarding anaphylaxis and epinephrine auto-injector access and use," and advocated for state laws protecting school from legal liability for stocking and using epinephrine autoinjectors.  Gayle Manchin, the mother of Mylan's CEO, Heather Bresch, had become president of the association in 2010, and shortly after had discussed donations from her "daughter's company" to the association.  Manchin had been appointed to the West Virginia state school board by her husband, then-governor of the state [[Joe Manchin]], in 2007.<ref name=USAtodayFamily>{{cite news|last1=O'Donnell|first1=Jayne|title=Family matters:  EpiPens had high-level help getting into schools|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/09/20/family-matters-epipens-had-help-getting-schools-manchin-bresch/90435218/|work=USA Today|date=September 21, 2016}}</ref>

After successful lobbying from Mylan,<ref name=BloomMarketing/> in 2013, the "School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act" became law after passing Congress with broad and bipartisan support; it protected anyone from liability if they administered epinephrine to a child in a school (previously, only trained professionals or the affected person were allowed to administer the drug, and were open to liability), and it provided some financial incentives for schools that didn‚Äôt already stock epinephrine autoinjector to start stocking them.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Novak|first1=Matt|title=How Congress, the FDA, and Sarah Jessica Parker Helped EpiPen Become a $1 Billion Business|url=https://gizmodo.com/how-congress-the-fda-and-sarah-jessica-parker-helped-1785568792|publisher=Gizmodo|date=August 23, 2016}}</ref> Joe Manchin, the father of Mylan's CEO, was a senator at that time.<ref name=USAtodayFamily/>

Starting in 2014, according to a 2017 report in the ''New York Times'', mid-level executives began questioning the rate at which the company had increased and was planning to continue to increase the price of the Epi-Pen, and raising concerns that the price increases were unethical; the ''Times'' reported that when these concerns were brought to Robert Coury, the chairman of the board, Coury "replied that he was untroubled. He raised both his middle fingers and explained, using colorful language, that anyone criticizing Mylan, including its employees, ought to go copulate with themselves. Critics in Congress and on Wall Street, he said, should do the same. And regulators at the Food and Drug Administration? They, too, deserved a round of anatomically challenging self-fulfillment." &nbsp;The ''Times'' reported that Bresch provided similarly dismissive responses.<ref name=NYT2017copulate>{{cite news|last1=Duhigg|first1=Charles|title=Outcry Over EpiPen Prices Hasn‚Äôt Made Them Lower|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/04/business/angry-about-epipen-prices-executive-dont-care-much.html?_r=1|work=The New York Times|date=4 June 2017}}</ref>

In April 2015, Mylan tried negotiate with the management of [[Ireland|Irish]] pharmaceutical firm [[Perrigo]] to acquire the company, and when those negotiations failed Mylan attempted a hostile takeover, offering to buy $26B in shares directly from shareholders; too few shareholders agreed to sell their stock by the deadline set in November 2015 and the effort failed.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Koons|first1=Cynthia|title=Mylan's Hostile Bid for Perrigo Fails|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-13/mylan-s-hostile-bid-for-perrigo-fails-as-40-of-shares-tendered|work=Bloomberg|date=November 13, 2015}}</ref>

According to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General analysis, the U.S. government may have overpaid "as much as $1.27 billion between 2006 and 2016" to drugmaker Mylan N.V. for the EpiPen emergency allergy treatment. This represents three times the proposed settlement of $465 million announced by Mylan in October 2016.

In June 2017 the ''New York Times'' published an article reporting on internal Mylan discussions about price increases on the EpiPen between 2014 and 2016, in which the company chairman expressed disdain for people and agencies who might criticize the company; the reporter wrote: "Those top leaders‚Äô responses are a far cry from the message on Mylan‚Äôs website, which says that 'we challenge every member of every team to challenge the status quo,' and that 'we put people and patients first, trusting that profits will follow.'", and also noted that "The firm is a case study in the limits of what consumer and employee activism, as well as government oversight, can achieve." <ref name=NYT2017copulate/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Novak|first1=Matt|title=Drug Company Chairman to America: Go Fuck Yourself|url=https://gizmodo.com/drug-company-chairman-to-america-go-fuck-yourself-1795816263|work=Gizmodo|date=5 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Mole|first1=Beth|title=Mylan chairman: Drug pricing critics ought to go copulate with themselves |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/06/mylan-chairman-drug-pricing-critics-ought-to-go-copulate-with-themselves/|work=Ars Technica|date=5 June 2017|language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Loew|first1=Derek|title=Mylan Begins Harvesting the Crop It's Sown|url=http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/06/12/mylan-begins-harvesting-the-crop-its-sown|work=In the Pipeline|date=12 June 2017}}</ref>

===Execution drugs===

Mylan manufactures [[rocuronium bromide]], which is approved by the state of [[Alabama]] for use in executions by [[lethal injection]]. European manufacturers refuse to sell drugs which can be used for executions to the United States, except to distributors or users who sign legally binding agreements that the drug will not be used for executions down the delivery chain.<ref name="execution">{{cite journal

In September 2014, the [[London]]-based [[human rights]] organization [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]] told Mylan that they were the only [[FDA]]-approved manufacturer of [[rocuronium bromide]] without legal controls in place to prevent its use in executions, and there was "a very real risk that Mylan may soon become the go-to provider of execution drugs for states across the country". The German asset manager {{Interlanguage link multi|DJE Kapital|de}} [[divested]] itself of $70 million in Mylan shares for that reason. Mylan said that their distribution was "legally compliant".<ref name="execution"/>
