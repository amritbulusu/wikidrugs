==Medical uses==
Chlorpromazine is classified as a low-potency [[typical antipsychotic]] and in the past was used in the treatment of both acute and chronic [[psychosis|psychoses]], including [[schizophrenia]] and the manic phase of [[bipolar disorder]], as well as [[Amphetamine|amphetamine-induced]] psychoses. Low-potency antipsychotics have more [[anticholinergic]] side effects, such as dry mouth, sedation, and constipation, and lower rates of [[Extrapyramidal symptoms|extrapyramidal]] side effects, while high-potency antipsychotics (such as [[haloperidol]]) have the reverse profile.<ref name =GG/>

In a 2013 comparison of 15 antipsychotics in schizophrenia, chlorpromazine demonstrated mild-standard effectiveness. It was 13% more effective than [[lurasidone]] and [[iloperidone]], approximately as effective as [[ziprasidone]] and [[asenapine]], and 12-16% less effective than [[haloperidol]], [[quetiapine]], and [[aripiprazole]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Leucht|first1=Stefan|last2=Cipriani|first2=Andrea|last3=Spineli|first3=Loukia|last4=Mavridis|first4=Dimitris|last5=Örey|first5=Deniz|last6=Richter|first6=Franziska|last7=Samara|first7=Myrto|last8=Barbui|first8=Corrado|last9=Engel|first9=Rolf R|last10=Geddes|first10=John R|last11=Kissling|first11=Werner|last12=Stapf|first12=Marko Paul|last13=Lässig|first13=Bettina|last14=Salanti|first14=Georgia|last15=Davis|first15=John M|title=Comparative efficacy and tolerability of 15 antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia: a multiple-treatments meta-analysis|journal=The Lancet|date=September 2013|volume=382|issue=9896|pages=951–962|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60733-3}}</ref> 

Chlorpromazine has also been used in [[porphyria]] and as part of [[tetanus]] treatment. It still is recommended for short-term management of severe anxiety and psychotic aggression.

Very rarely, elongation of the QT interval may occur, increasing the risk of potentially fatal arrhythmias.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Thomas D |title=The antipsychotic drug chlorpromazine inhibits HERG potassium channels |journal=British Journal of Pharmacology |volume=139 |issue=3|pages=567–74|date=June 2003 |pmid=12788816 |pmc=1573882 |doi=10.1038/sj.bjp.0705283|author2=Wu K|author3=Kathöfer S|display-authors=3|last4=Katus|first4=Hugo A|last5=Schoels|first5=Wolfgang|last6=Kiehn|first6=Johann|last7=Karle|first7=Christoph A}}</ref>

===Interactions===
Consuming food prior to taking chlorpromazine orally limits its absorption, likewise cotreatment with [[benztropine]] can also reduce chlorpromazine absorption.<ref name = TGA/> [[Ethanol|Alcohol]] can also reduce chlorpromazine absorption.<ref name = TGA/> Antacids slow chlorpromazine absorption.<ref name = TGA/> [[Lithium (medication)|Lithium]] and chronic treatment with [[barbiturates]] can increase chlorpromazine clearance significantly.<ref name = TGA/> [[Tricyclic antidepressants]] (TCAs) can decrease chlorpromazine clearance and hence increase chlorpromazine exposure.<ref name = TGA/> Cotreatment with [[CYP1A2]] inhibitors like [[ciprofloxacin]], [[fluvoxamine]] or [[vemurafenib]] can reduce chlorpromazine clearance and hence increase exposure and potentially also adverse effects.<ref name = TGA/> Chlorpromazine can also potentiate the CNS depressant effects of drugs like [[barbiturates]], [[benzodiazepines]], [[opioids]], lithium and anaesthetics and hence increase the potential for adverse effects such as [[respiratory depression]] and [[sedation]].<ref name =TGA/>

It is also a moderate inhibitor of [[CYP2D6]] and also a substrate for [[CYP2D6]] and hence can inhibit its own metabolism.<ref name =GG/> It can also inhibit the clearance of [[CYP2D6]] substrates such as [[dextromethorphan]] and hence also potentiate their effects.<ref name = GG/> Other drugs like [[codeine]] and [[tamoxifen]] which require [[CYP2D6]]-mediated activation into their respective active metabolites may have their therapeutic effects attenuated.<ref name = GG/> Likewise [[CYP2D6]] inhibitors such as [[paroxetine]] or [[fluoxetine]] can reduce chlorpromazine clearance and hence increase serum levels of chlorpromazine and hence potentially also its adverse effects.<ref name = TGA/> Chlorpromazine also reduces [[phenytoin]] levels and increases [[valproic acid]] levels.<ref name =TGA/> It also reduces [[propranolol]] clearance and antagonises the therapeutic effects of [[antidiabetic]] agents, [[levodopa]] (a [[Parkinson's]] medication. This is likely due to the fact that chlorpromazine antagonises the D<sub>2</sub> receptor which is one of the receptors dopamine, a levodopa metabolite, activates), [[amfetamine]]s and [[anticoagulant]]s.<ref name = TGA/> It may also interact with anticholinergic drugs such as [[orphenadrine]] to produce [[hypoglycaemia]] (low blood sugar).<ref name = TGA/>

Chlorpromazine may also interact with [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline) to produce a paradoxical fall in blood pressure.<ref name = TGA/> [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitors]] (MAOIs) and [[thiazide]] diuretics may also accentuate the orthostatic hypotension experienced by those receiving chlorpromazine treatment.<ref name = TGA/> Quinidine may interact with chlorpromazine to increase [[myocardium|myocardial]]depression.<ref name = TGA/> Likewise it may also antagonize the effects of [[clonidine]] and [[guanethidine]].<ref name = TGA/> It also may reduce the seizure threshold and hence a corresponding titration of anticonvulsant treatments should be considered.<ref name = TGA/> [[Prochlorperazine]] and [[desferrioxamine]] may also interact with chlorpromazine to produce transient metabolic [[encephalopathy]].<ref name = TGA/>

Other drugs that prolong the QT interval such as [[quinidine]], [[verapamil]], [[amiodarone]], [[sotalol]] and [[methadone]] may also interact with chlorpromazine to produce additive [[QT interval]] prolongation.<ref name = TGA/>

===Tolerance and withdrawal===
The [[British National Formulary]] recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotic treatment to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse.<ref name="BNF">{{cite book | isbn = 978-0-85711-084-8 | title = British National Formulary (BNF) | last1 = Joint Formulary Committee | year = 2013 | publisher = Pharmaceutical Press | location = London, UK | edition = 65  | pages =  }}</ref> While withdrawal symptoms can occur, there is no evidence that tolerance develops to the drug's antipsychotic effects. A patient can be maintained for years on a therapeutically effective dose without any decrease in effectiveness being reported. Tolerance appears to develop to the sedating effects of chlorpromazine when it is first administered. Tolerance also appears to develop to the extrapyramidal, parkinsonian and other neuroleptic effects, although this is debatable.<ref name="Kin"/>

A failure to notice withdrawal symptoms may be due to the relatively long half life of the drug resulting in the extremely slow excretion from the body. However, there are reports of muscular discomfort, exaggeration of psychotic symptoms and movement disorders, and difficulty sleeping when the antipsychotic drug is suddenly withdrawn, but after years of normal doses these effects are not normally seen.<ref name="Kin"/>

===Pharmacodynamics===
Chlorpromazine is a very effective antagonist of [[Dopamine receptor D2|D2]] [[dopamine]] receptors and similar receptors, such as [[Dopamine receptor D3|D3]] and [[Dopamine receptor D5|D5]]. Unlike most other drugs of this genre, it also has a high affinity for [[Dopamine receptor D1|D1]] receptors. Blocking these receptors causes diminished neurotransmitter binding in the forebrain, resulting in many different effects. [[Dopamine]], unable to bind with a receptor, causes a feedback loop that causes dopaminergic neurons to release more dopamine. Therefore, upon first taking the drug, patients will experience an increase in dopaminergic neural activity. Eventually, dopamine production of the neurons will drop substantially and dopamine will be removed from the [[synaptic cleft]]. At this point, neural activity decreases greatly; the continual blockade of receptors only compounds this effect.<ref name="GG"/>

Chlorpromazine acts as an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] (blocking agent) on different postsynaptic and presynaptic receptors:

*[[Dopamine receptor]]s (subtypes D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub> and D<sub>4</sub>), which account for its different antipsychotic properties on productive and unproductive symptoms, in the mesolimbic dopamine system accounts for the antipsychotic effect whereas the blockade in the nigrostriatal system produces the extrapyramidal effects
*[[Serotonin receptor]]s (5-HT<sub>1</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2</sub>), with anxiolytic, and antiaggressive properties as well as an attenuation of [[extrapyramidal side effect]]s, but also leading to weight gain and ejaculation difficulties.
*[[Histamine receptor]]s ([[histamine H1 receptor|H<sub>1</sub> receptor]]s, accounting for sedation, antiemetic effect, vertigo, and weight gain)
*[[Adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>- and α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor]]s (accounting for sympatholytic properties, lowering of blood pressure, reflex tachycardia, vertigo, sedation, hypersalivation and incontinence as well as sexual dysfunction, but may also attenuate pseudoparkinsonism—controversial. Also associated with weight gain as a result of blockage of the adrenergic alpha 1 receptor)
*[[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor|M<sub>1</sub> and M<sub>2</sub> muscarinic acetylcholine receptor]]s (causing anticholinergic symptoms such as dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, difficulty or inability to urinate, sinus tachycardia, [[electrocardiogram|electrocardiographic]] changes and loss of memory, but the anticholinergic action may attenuate extrapyramidal side effects).

The presumed effectiveness of the antipsychotic drugs relied on their ability to block dopamine receptors. This assumption arose from the dopamine hypothesis that maintains that both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are a result of excessive dopamine activity. Furthermore, psychomotor stimulants like cocaine that increase dopamine levels can cause psychotic symptoms if taken in excess.<ref name="Girault, 2004">{{Cite journal|vauthors=Girault J, Greengard P |title=The neurobiology of dopamine signaling |journal=Arch Neurol |volume=61|issue=5|pages=641–44 |year=2004 |pmid=15148138 |doi=10.1001/archneur.61.5.641}}</ref>

Chlorpromazine and other typical [[antipsychotics]] are primarily blockers of [[D2 receptors]]. In fact an almost perfect correlation exists between the therapeutic dose of a typical antipsychotic and the drug's affinity for the D2 receptor. Therefore, a larger dose is required if the drug’s affinity for the D2 receptor is relatively weak. A correlation exists between average clinical potency and affinity of the antipsychotics for [[dopamine]] receptors.<ref name="Kin">{{Cite book| last=McKim| first=William A.| title=Drugs and behavior: an introduction to behavioral pharmacology| edition=6th| publisher=Prentice Hall| location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey| year=2007| page=416| isbn=978-0-13-219788-5}}</ref>
Chlorpromazine tends to have greater effect at [[serotonin]] receptors than at [[Dopamine receptor D2|D2]] receptors, which is notably the opposite effect of the other typical antipsychotics. Therefore, chlorpromazine with respect to its effects on dopamine and serotonin receptors is more similar to the atypical antipsychotics than to the typical antipsychotics.<ref name="Kin"/>

Chlorpromazine and other antipsychotics with [[sedative]] properties such as [[promazine]] and [[thioridazine]] are among the most potent agents at [[α-adrenergic receptor]]s. Furthermore, they are also among the most potent antipsychotics at [[histamine]] [[Histamine H1 receptor|H1]] receptors. This finding is in agreement with the pharmaceutical development of chlorpromazine and other antipsychotics as anti-histamine agents. Furthermore, the brain has a higher density of histamine H1 receptors than any body organ examined which may account for why chlorpromazine and other [[phenothiazine]] antipsychotics are as potent at these sites as the most potent classical [[antihistamines]].<ref name="Per">{{Cite journal|vauthors=Peroutka SJ, Synder SH |title=Relationship of neuroleptic drug effects at brain dopamine, serotonin, alpha-adrenergic, and histamine receptors to clinical potency |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=137|issue=12 |pages=1518–22 |date=December 1980 |pmid=6108081 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=6108081}}</ref>

In addition to influencing the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, [[epinephrine]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[acetylcholine]] it has been reported that antipsychotic drugs could achieve glutamanergic effects. This mechanism involves direct effects on antipsychotic drugs on [[glutamate]] receptors. By using the technique of functional neurochemical assay chlorpromazine and phenothiazine derivatives have been shown to have inhibitory effects on [[NMDA]] receptors that appeared to be mediated by action at the Zn site. It was found that there is an increase of NMDA activity at low concentrations and suppression at high concentrations of the drug. No significant difference in glutamate and [[glycine]] activity from the effects of chlorpromazine were reported. Further work will be necessary to determine if the influence in NMDA receptors by antipsychotic drugs contributes to their effectiveness.<ref name="Lid">{{Cite journal|vauthors=Lidsky TI, Yablonsky-Alter E, Zuck LG, Banerjee SP |title=Antipsychotic drug effects on glutamatergic activity |journal=Brain Research|volume=764 |issue=1–2 |pages=46–52 |date=August 1997 |pmid=9295192 |doi=10.1016/S0006-8993(97)00423-X}}</ref>

Chlorpromazine does also act as [[FIASMA]] (functional inhibitor of [[Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase|acid sphingomyelinase]]).<ref name="pmid18504571">{{cite journal |author=Kornhuber J, Muehlbacher M, Trapp S, Pechmann S, Friedl A, Reichel M, Mühle C, Terfloth L, Groemer T, Spitzer G, Liedl K, Gulbins E, Tripal P|title=Identification of novel functional inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=6|issue=8|pages=e23852|year=2011|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0023852|pmid=21909365|pmc=3166082|editor1-last=Riezman |editor1-first=Howard}}</ref>

===Peripheral effects===
Chlorpromazine is an antagonist to [[histamine H1 receptor|H<sub>1</sub> receptor]]s (provoking antiallergic effects), [[histamine H2 receptor|H<sub>2</sub> receptor]]s (reduction of forming of gastric juice), [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor|M<sub>1</sub> and M<sub>2</sub> receptor]]s (dry mouth, reduction in forming of gastric juice) and some [[5-HT receptor]]s (different anti-allergic/gastrointestinal actions).

Because it acts on so many receptors, chlorpromazine is often referred to as a "[[Dirty Drug|dirty drug]]".<ref name="Falkai">{{Cite web |url=http://www.biopsychiatry.com/antipsychotics.htm |title=The chances of new atypical substances |last=Falkai |first=P |author2=Vogeley K |date=April 2000 |publisher=biopsychiatry.com |accessdate=6 July 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724041027/http://www.biopsychiatry.com/antipsychotics.htm |archivedate=24 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Thorazine advert.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for Thorazine (chlorpromazine) from the early 1960s<ref>{{cite web| title= Thorazine advertisement| publisher= Smith Kline & French | year= c. 1963| quote=When the patient lashes out against 'them' — THORAZINE (brand of chlorpromazine) quickly puts an end to his violent outburst. 'Thorazine' is especially effective when the psychotic episode is triggered by delusions or hallucinations. At the outset of treatment, Thorazine's combination of antipsychotic and sedative effects provides both emotional and physical calming. Assaultive or destructive behavior is rapidly controlled. As therapy continues, the initial sedative effect gradually disappears. But the antipsychotic effect continues, helping to dispel or modify delusions, hallucinations and confusion, while keeping the patient calm and approachable. SMITH KLINE AND FRENCH LABORATORIES leaders in psychopharmaceutical research}}</ref>]]
In 1933, the French pharmaceutical company [[Laboratoires Rhône-Poulenc]] began to search for new anti-histamines.  In 1947, it synthesized [[promethazine]], a [[phenothiazine]] derivative, which was found to have more pronounced sedative and antihistaminic effects than earlier drugs.<ref>{{Cite book |last        = Healy |first       = David |title       = The creation of psychopharmacology |year        = 2004 |publisher   = Harvard University Press |isbn        = 978-0-674-01599-9 |page        = 77 |chapter     = Explorations in a new world |url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=6O2rPJnyhj0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn=978-0-674-01599-9&cd=1#v=onepage&q |deadurl     = no |accessdate  = 26 November 2013 |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170908170912/https://books.google.com/books?id=6O2rPJnyhj0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn=978-0-674-01599-9&cd=1#v=onepage&q |archivedate = 8 September 2017 |df          = dmy-all}}</ref> A year later, the French surgeon Pierre Huguenard used promethazine together with [[pethidine]] as part of a cocktail to induce relaxation and indifference in surgical patients. Another surgeon, [[Henri Laborit]], believed the compound stabilized the central nervous system by causing "artificial hibernation", and described this state as "sedation without [[narcotic|narcosis]]". He suggested to Rhône-Poulenc that they develop a compound with better stabilizing properties.<ref>{{Cite book| last=Healy| first=David| title=The creation of psychopharmacology| year=2004| publisher=Harvard University Press| isbn=978-0-674-01599-9| page=80| chapter=Explorations in a new world}}</ref> In December 1950, the chemist Paul Charpentier produced a series of compounds that included RP4560 or chlorpromazine.<ref name="history05"/> Simone Courvoisier conducted behavioural tests and found chlorpromazine produced indifference to [[aversives|aversive stimuli]] in rats. Chlorpromazine was distributed for testing to physicians between April and August 1951. Laborit trialled the medicine on at the [[Val-de-Grâce]] military hospital in Paris, using it as an anaesthetic booster in intravenous doses of 50 to 100&nbsp;mg on surgery patients and confirming it as the best drug to date in calming and reducing shock, with patients reporting improved well being afterwards. He also noted its hypothermic effect and suggested it may induce artificial hibernation. Laborit thought this would allow the body to better tolerate major surgery by reducing shock, a novel idea at the time. Known colloquially as "Laborit's drug", chlorpromazine was released onto the market in 1953 by Rhône-Poulenc and given the trade name ''Largactil'', derived from ''large'' "broad" and ''acti*'' "activity''.<ref name="history05"/><!-- cites previous four sentences -->

Following on, Laborit considered whether chlorpromazine may have a role in managing patients with severe burns, [[Raynaud's phenomenon]], or psychiatric disorders. At the Villejuif Mental Hospital in November 1951, he and Montassut administered an intravenous dose to psychiatrist Cornelia Quarti who was acting as a volunteer. Quarti noted the indifference, but fainted upon getting up to go to the toilet, and so further testing was discontinued ([[orthostatic hypotension]] is a possible side effect of chlorpromazine). Despite this, Laborit continued to push for testing in psychiatric patients during early 1952. Psychiatrists were reluctant initially, but on January 19, 1952, it was administered (alongside pethidine, [[pentothal]] and ECT) to Jacques Lh. a 24-year-old manic patient, who responded dramatically, and was discharged after three weeks having received 855&nbsp;mg of the drug in total.<ref name="history05"/><!-- cites previous four sentences -->

[[Pierre Deniker]] had heard about Laborit's work from his brother-in-law, who was a surgeon, and ordered chlorpromazine for a clinical trial at the Hôpital Sainte-Anne in Paris where he was Men's Service Chief.<ref name="history05"/> Together with the Director of the hospital, Professor [[Jean Delay]], they published their first clinical trial in 1952, in which they treated 38 psychotic patients with daily injections of chlorpromazine without the use of other sedating agents.<ref name="Turner2007"/> The response was dramatic; treatment with chlorpromazine went beyond simple sedation with patients showing improvements in thinking and emotional behaviour.<ref name="healy1">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6O2rPJnyhj0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn=978-0-674-01599-9&cd=1#v=onepage&q=chlorpromazie |title=The Creation of Psychopharmacology |last=Healy |first=David |year=2004 |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=37–73 |isbn=978-0-674-01599-9 |deadurl=no |accessdate=26 November 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908170912/https://books.google.com/books?id=6O2rPJnyhj0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn=978-0-674-01599-9&cd=1#v=onepage&q=chlorpromazie |archivedate=8 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> They also found that doses higher than those used by Laborit were required, giving patients 75–100&nbsp;mg daily.<ref name="history05"/>

Deniker then visited America, where the publication of their work alerted the American psychiatric community that the new treatment might represent a real breakthrough. Heinz Lehmann of the [[Douglas Hospital|Verdun Protestant Hospital]] in Montreal trialled it in 70 patients and also noted its striking effects, with patients' symptoms resolving after many years of unrelenting psychosis.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} By 1954, chlorpromazine was being used in the United States to treat [[schizophrenia]], [[mania]], psychomotor excitement, and other [[psychosis|psychotic]] disorders.<ref name="GG">{{cite book | isbn = 978-0-07-162442-8 | title = [[Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics]] | edition = 12th | last1= Brunton| first1= L| last2= Chabner| first2= B| last3= Knollman| first3= B | year = 2010 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | location = New York }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| last=Long|first=James W.|title=The Essential guide to prescription drugs| publisher= HarperPerennial| location= New York|year=1992|pages=321–325|isbn=978-0-06-271534-0}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| last= Reines| first= Brandon P| year= 1990| title= The Relationship Between Laboratory and Clinical Studies in Psychopharmacologic Discovery| journal= Perspectives on Medical Research| volume= 2| publisher= Medical Research Modernization Society| url= http://www.curedisease.net/reports/Perspectives/vol_2_1990/PsycholDisc.html| deadurl= no| accessdate= 26 November 2013| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150907024721/http://www.curedisease.net/reports/Perspectives/vol_2_1990/PsycholDisc.html| archivedate= 7 September 2015| df= dmy-all}}</ref>
