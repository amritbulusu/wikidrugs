== Medical uses ==
Biperiden is used for the adjunctive treatment of all forms of [[Parkinson's disease]] and for reduced sweating in [[methadone]] users (postencephalitic, [[idiopathic]], and arteriosclerotic). It seems to exert better effects in the postencephalitic and idiopathic than in the arteriosclerotic type.

Biperiden is also commonly used to improve parkinsonian signs and symptoms related to [[antipsychotic]] drug therapy, such as [[akathisia]].

It relieves [[muscle rigidity]], reduces [[abnormal sweating]] related with [[clozapine]] and [[methadone]] use<ref name="pmid11481174">{{cite journal |vauthors=Richardson C, Kelly DL, Conley RR |title=Biperiden for excessive sweating from clozapine |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=158 |issue=8 |pages=1329–30 |date=August 2001 |pmid=11481174 |doi= 10.1176/appi.ajp.158.8.1329-a|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11481174}}</ref><ref name="pmid12562595">{{cite journal |vauthors=Caflisch C, Figner B, Eich D |title=Biperiden for excessive sweating from methadone |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=160 |issue=2 |pages=386–7 |date=February 2003 |pmid=12562595 |doi= 10.1176/appi.ajp.160.2.386|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12562595}}</ref> and [[salivation]], improves [[abnormal gait]], and to lesser extent, [[tremor]].

In its role as a synthetic acetylcholine antagonist, biperiden has been analyzed as an alternative anticonvulsant for usage in the treatment of intoxication by organophosphorus nerve agents, such as [[sarin]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shim|first=TM|author2=McDonough JH |title=Efficacy of biperiden and atropine as anticonvulsant treatment for organophosphorus nerve agent intoxication|journal=Archives of Toxicology|date=May 2000|volume=74|issue=3|pages=165–172|doi=10.1007/s002040050670|pmid=10877003}}</ref>

=== Pregnancy and lactation ===
* Pregnancy : In animal studies biperiden had no embryo- or fetotoxic effects. There is no sufficient clinical data on pregnant women. The drug should therefore be used cautiously during pregnancy.
* Lactation : Biperiden is found in the milk of lactating women. No sufficient clinical data exists regarding effects for the newborns. Additionally, biperiden may decrease maternal milk production. It is therefore recommended that biperiden is not used during lactation.

=== Children ===
Children and adolescents aged 1 year and older may be treated. The clinical experience is mainly on the short-term treatment of acute drug induced dystonic reactions. Doses should be reduced according to the weight of the patients.

== Contraindications ==
* Hypersensitivity to biperiden
* Narrow angle [[glaucoma]]
* [[Ileus]]
* Caution : People with obstructive diseases of the urogenital tract, people with a known history of seizures and those with potentially dangerous [[tachycardia]]

== Side effects ==
Dose-dependent [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]]s are frequent. Particularly geriatric patients may react with confusional states or develop [[delirium]].

* CNS : [[Drowsiness]], [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], [[headache]], and [[dizziness]] are frequent. With high doses nervousness, agitation, [[anxiety]], delirium, and confusion are noted. Biperiden may be abused due to a short acting mood-elevating and euphoriant effect. The normal sleep architecture may be altered ([[REM sleep]] depression). Biperiden may lower the seizure-threshold.  Some instances of dementia have been noted to correlate with chronic administration of [[anticholinergic]] medications such as Biperiden for [[Parkinson's disease]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Nishiyama K, Mizuno T, Sakuta M, Kurisaki H | title = Chronic dementia in Parkinson's disease treated by anticholinergic agents. Neuropsychological and neuroradiological examination. | journal = Adv Neurol | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 479&ndash;83 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8420174}}</ref>
* Peripheral side effects : Blurred vision, dry mouth, impaired sweating, abdominal discomfort, and obstipation are frequent. Tachycardia may be noted. Allergic skin reactions may occur. Parenteral use may cause orthostatic hypotension.
* Eyes : Biperiden causes [[mydriasis]] with or without [[photophobia]]. It may precipitate narrow angle glaucoma.

== Interactions ==
* Other anticholinergic drugs (e.g. spasmolytics, [[antihistamine]]s, TCAs) : Side effects of biperiden may be increased.
* [[Quinidine]] : Increased anticholinergic action (particular on AV conduction).
* Antipsychotics : Long-term use of biperiden may mask or increase the risk of [[tardive dyskinesia]].
* [[Pethidine]] (meperidine) : Central effects and side effects of pethidine may be increased.
* [[Metoclopramide]] : Action of metoclopramide is decreased.
* Alcohol : Risk of serious intoxication.

== Overdose ==
Biperiden mimics an atropine intoxication with mydriasis, dryness of mucous membranes, red face, atonic states of bowels and bladder, and [[hyperthermia]] in high doses. Central consequences are agitation, confusion, and hallucinations. An untreated overdose may be fatal, particular in children. Premortal signs are respiratory depression and cardiac arrest. A specific antagonist is [[physostigmine]] which combines a peripheral and a central action. [[Carbachol]] can be used to treat atonic bowels and bladder. The vital functions should be monitored and stabilized. It may be necessary to treat hyperthermia with cooling blankets.

== Pharmacokinetics ==
The oral [[bioavailability]] is only 33 ± 5% due to extensive [[First pass effect|first-pass metabolism]]. In young, healthy volunteers, peak plasma concentrations following a single oral 4&nbsp;mg immediate-release dose are reached after 1.5 hours. The [[elimination half-life]] has been determined as 18.4 hours, and may be prolonged in geriatric patients. After a 4&nbsp;mg intravenous dose, the elimination half-life is approximately 24 hours.

== Pharmacology ==
Biperiden has an [[atropine]]-like blocking effect on all peripheral structures which are parasympathetic-innervated (e.g. cardiovascular and visceral organs). It also has a prominent central blocking effect on [[Muscarinic receptor#Receptor Subtype M1|M1 receptor]]s. Biperiden does also act as [[FIASMA]] (functional inhibitor of [[Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase|acid sphingomyelinase]]).<ref name="pmid18504571">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kornhuber J, Muehlbacher M, Trapp S, Pechmann S, Friedl A, Reichel M, Mühle C, Terfloth L, Groemer T, Spitzer G, Liedl K, Gulbins E, Tripal P |title=Identification of novel functional inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=6|issue=8|pages=e23852|year=2011|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0023852|pmid=21909365|pmc=3166082}}</ref>

== History ==
Biperiden was synthesized by the German chemist W. Klavehn from Knoll AG, Germany. In March 1953 a patent was applied for in Germany<ref>[http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?DB=worldwide.espacenet.com&II=31&ND=3&adjacent=true&locale=en_EP&FT=D&date=19570328&CC=DE&NR=1005067B&KC=B Espacenet - Bibliographic data<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and subsequently in many other countries. A US patent application was filed in March 1954 and granted in April 1957.<ref>[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=2789110.PN.&OS=PN/2789110&RS=PN/2789110 United States Patent: 2789110<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
