==Medical uses==
Intravenous sodium bicarbonate is indicated in the treatment of [[metabolic acidosis]], such as can occur in, for example, severe [[renal disease]], [[diabetic ketoacidosis]], [[circulatory insufficiency]], [[extracorporeal circulation]] of blood, in [[hemolysis]] requiring alkalinization of the urine to avoid [[nephrotoxicity]] of blood pigments, and certain [[drug intoxication]]s, such as by [[barbiturate overdose]], [[salicylate poisoning]], [[tricyclic antidepressant overdose]] or [[methanol poisoning]].<ref name=drugs/> In addition, sodium bicarbonate is indicated in severe [[diarrhea]], where large amounts of bicarbonate may be lost.<ref name=drugs/> However, overall treatment should also strive to treat the underlying cause of the acidosis, such as giving [[insulin]] in case of [[diabetic ketoacidosis]].<ref name=drugs/>

==Contraindications==
Intravenous sodium bicarbonate is contraindicated in patients who are losing [[chloride]], such as by vomiting.<ref name=drugs/>

Because of its sodium content, intravenous sodium bicarbonate should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with [[congestive heart failure]] and severe [[renal insufficiency]], where [[Low sodium diet|low sodium intake]] is strongly indicated to prevent [[sodium retention]].<ref name=drugs/> By similar rationale, intravenous sodium bicarbonate should be given with caution to patients receiving [[corticosteroids]].<ref name=drugs/>

==Side effects==
[[Extravasation]] of intravenous sodium bicarbonate has been reported to cause [[chemical cellulitis]] because of its alkalinity, resulting in tissue [[necrosis]], [[ulceration]] and/or [[sloughing]] at the site of infiltration. This condition is managed by prompt elevation of the part, warmth and local injection of [[lidocaine]] or [[hyaluronidase]].<ref name=drugs/>

==Interactions==
Norepinephrine and dobutamine cannot be used as additives in an intravenous sodium bicarbonate solution.<ref name=drugs/>

Intravenous sodium bicarbonate should not be mixed with [[calcium]], as they may [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]], except where compatibility has been previously established for the preparations at hand.<ref name=drugs/>

==Overdosing==
Overdose of intravenous sodium bicarbonate results in solute and/or [[fluid overload]], potentially leading to [[edema]], including [[pulmonary edema]].<ref name=drugs/> Also, it can cause [[metabolic alkalosis]] (with signs including [[muscular twitching]]s, [[irritability]] and [[tetany]]).<ref name=drugs/> [[Hypernatremia]] is also possible.<ref name=drugs/> Repeated fractional doses and frequent monitoring by laboratory tests are recommended to minimize the possibility of overdosing.<ref name=drugs/>

Rapid administration (equal to or exceeding 10 mL/min) of intravenous sodium bicarbonate into neonates and children under two years of age may produce [[hypernatremia]], resulting in a decrease in [[cerebrospinal fluid pressure]] and, possibly, [[intracranial hemorrhage]]. Therefore, the rate of administration to such patients should not exceed 8 mEq/kg/day, unless a very strong indication is present.<ref name=drugs/>

==Composition==
It is administered as a [[hypertonic solution]] of [[sodium bicarbonate]], most commonly in concentrations of 4.2%, 5.0%, 7.5% or 8.4%.<ref name=drugs>[http://www.drugs.com/pro/sodium-bicarbonate.html Sodium Bicarbonate, Dosage Form: injection, solution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303061531/http://www.drugs.com/pro/sodium-bicarbonate.html |date=2011-03-03 }} from [[Drugs.com]]. Revised: 03/2011 by General Injectables & Vaccines, Inc.</ref> 

The solutions generally contain no [[antimicrobial agent]] or other added buffer.<ref name=drugs/>

==Mechanism of action==
After injection, intravenous sodium bicarbonate dissociates to provide sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) and bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>âˆ’</sup>) [[anion]]s. Bicarbonate anions can consume hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) and thereby be converted to [[carbonic acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), which can subsequently be converted to water (H<sub>2</sub>O) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) which can be excreted by the lungs.<ref name=drugs/>
