'''Fluvoxamine''' (brand names: '''Faverin''', '''Fevarin''', '''Floxyfral''', '''Dumyrox''' and '''Luvox''') is a medication which functions as a [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SSRI) and [[Sigma 1 receptor|σ<sub>1</sub> receptor]] [[agonist]]. Fluvoxamine is used primarily for the treatment of [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD),<ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/FDA+ADVISORY+COMMITTEE+RECOMMENDS+LUVOX+(FLUVOXAMINE)+TABLETS+FOR...-a014258615 "FDA Advisory Committee Recommends Luvox (Fluvoxamine) Tablets for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder," PRNewswire, 10/18/93]</ref> and is also used to treat [[major depressive disorder]] and [[anxiety disorder]]s such as [[panic disorder]] and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].<ref>{{cite journal | first = David P.
