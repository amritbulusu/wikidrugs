'''Thioridazine''' ('''Mellaril''' or '''Melleril''') is a [[piperidine]] typical [[antipsychotic]] [[psychoactive drug|drug]] belonging to the [[phenothiazine]] drug group and was previously widely used in the treatment of [[schizophrenia]] and [[psychosis]]. The branded product was withdrawn worldwide in 2005 because it caused severe cardiac arrhythmias. However, generic versions are still available in the US.<ref name = NHS/>
