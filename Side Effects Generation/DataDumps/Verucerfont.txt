'''Verucerfont''' ('''GSK-561,679''') is a drug developed by [[GlaxoSmithKline]] which acts as a [[Corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1|CRF-1]] antagonist. Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), also known as [[Corticotropin releasing hormone]], is an endogenous peptide hormone which is released in response to various triggers such as [[chronic stress]], and activates the two [[corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor]]s CRH-1 and CRH-2. This then triggers the release of [[Adrenocorticotropic hormone|corticotropin]] (ACTH), another hormone which is involved in the physiological response to stress. 

Verucerfont blocks the CRH-1 receptor, and so reduces ACTH release following chronic stress. It is under investigation as a potential treatment for [[alcoholism]], as chronic stress is often a factor in both development of alcoholism and relapse in recovering alcoholics. It has shown promising results in animal studies but has not been tested in humans.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2012.12.017 |pmid=23294766 |pmc=3596012 |title=Behavioral, biological, and chemical perspectives on targeting CRF1 receptor antagonists to treat alcoholism |journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence |volume=128 |issue=3 |pages=175â€“86 |year=2013 |last1=Zorrilla |first1=Eric P. |last2=Heilig |first2=Markus |last3=De Wit |first3=Harriet |last4=Shaham |first4=Yavin }}</ref>
