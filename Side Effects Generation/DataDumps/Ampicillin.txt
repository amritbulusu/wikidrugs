==Medical uses==
Ampicillin is used to treat infections by many [[Gram-positive bacteria|Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative bacteria]].  Ampicillin was the first 'broad spectrum' penicillin with activity against Gram-positive bacteria including ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'', some isolates of ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' (but not penicillin-resistant or methicillin-resistant strains), and some ''[[Enterococcus]]''. Activity against Gram-negative bacteria includes ''[[Neisseria meningitidis]]'', some ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'', and some of the [[Enterobacteriaceae]]. Its spectrum of activity is enhanced by co-administration of [[sulbactam]], a drug that inhibits [[beta lactamase]], an enzyme produced by bacteria to inactivate ampicillin and related antibiotics.<ref name =Hauser>Hauser AR (2013).

Ampicillin can be administered by [[oral administration |mouth]], an [[intramuscular injection]] (shot) or by [[intravenous infusion]].<ref name=AHFS2015/>

===Indications===
*[[respiratory infections]]
*[[sinusitis]]
*[[bronchitis]]
*[[pharyngitis]]
*[[otitis media]]
*[[bacterial meningitis]]<ref name = Davis/>
*''[[Salmonella]]'', ''[[Shigella]]'', and ''[[Listeria]]'' bacteria.
*[[gastrointestinal]] infections caused by contaminated water or food.
*[[healthcare-associated infections]] related to infection from [[catheter | urinary catheter use]] unresponsive to other medications.<ref name = Harrison>Finberg R, Fingeroth J in Longo DL, Fauci AS, Kasper DL, Hauser SL, Jameson JL, Loscalzo (eds.)

*''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'', ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' infections.
*[[Genito-urinary tract]] infections
*prevent infection (prophylaxis) in those who previously had rheumatic heart disease or are undergoing dental procedures.<ref name = Davis/>

==Side effects==
Ampicillin is comparatively less toxic than other antibiotics. In very rare cases, it causes severe side effects such as [[angioedema]], [[anaphylaxis]], and ''C. difficile'' infection. Some develop [[Black hairy tongue|black 'furry' tongue']]. The most serious adverse effects are [[seizure]]s, [[serum sickness]], [[anaphylaxis]], [[pseudomembranous colitis]]. The most common side effects to be expected in ten percent of users are [[diarrhea]] and [[rash]]. Less common side effects can be [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[itching]], blood [[dyscrasia#Modern use|dyscrasia]]s, and mild [[allergic reactions]]. Other conditions may develop up several weeks after treatment.<ref name=AHFS2015/><ref name=Davis> {{cite web| url = http://davisplus.fadavis.com/| access-date = March 22, 2017| publisher = Davis| title = Ampicillin| date = 2017| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170225031940/http://davisplus.fadavis.com/| archivedate = 25 February 2017| df = dmy-all}}</ref>

==Interactions==
Ampicillin reacts with [[probenecid]] to decrease [[renal excretion]]. Large doses of ampicillin can increase the risk of bleeding with concurrent use of [[warfarin]]. Ampicillin use can make [[oral contraceptives]] less effective.<ref name=AHFS2015/><ref name = Davis/>

==Mechanisms==
Ampicillin is in the [[penicillin]] group of [[β-Lactam antibiotic|beta-lactam antibiotic]]s and is part of the [[aminopenicillin]] family. It is roughly equivalent to [[amoxicillin]] in terms of activity.<ref name=AHFS2015/>

Ampicillin is able to penetrate Gram-positive and some Gram-negative bacteria. It differs from [[Benzylpenicillin|penicillin G]], or benzylpenicillin, only by the presence of an [[amino]] group. That amino group helps the drug penetrate the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Delcour|first=Anne H.|date=May 2009|title=Outer Membrane Permeability and Antibiotic Resistance|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2696358/|journal=Biochimica et biophysica acta|volume=1794|issue=5|pages=808–816|doi=10.1016/j.bbapap.2008.11.005|issn=0006-3002|pmc=2696358|pmid=19100346}}</ref>

Ampicillin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme [[DD-transpeptidase|transpeptidase]], which is needed by bacteria to make the cell wall.<ref name=AHFS2015/> It inhibits the third and final stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis in [[binary fission]], which ultimately leads to cell [[lysis]]; therefore, ampicillin is usually bacteriolytic.<ref name=AHFS2015/><ref name = "Goodman">Petri WA in Brunton LL, Chabner BA, Knollmann BC (eds.) (2011 ) ''Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics'', 12th ed., Chapter 53. McGraw-Hill, New York.</ref>

==History==
Ampicillin has been used extensively to treat bacterial infections since 1961.<ref name = acred>{{cite journal |title=Pharmacology and chemotherapy of ampicillin--a new broad-spectrum penicillin |journal=Br J Pharmacol Chemother |volume=18 |issue= 2|pages=356–69 |date=April 1962 |pmid=13859205 |pmc=1482127 |doi= 10.1111/j.1476-5381.1962.tb01416.x|url=|author1=Acred |first1=P |last2=Brown |first2=D.

J. }}</ref> Until the introduction of ampicillin by the British company [[Beecham (pharmaceutical company)|Beecham]], penicillin therapies had only been effective against Gram-positive organisms such as [[Staphylococcus|staphylococci]] and [[Streptococcus|streptococci]].<ref name=Goodman/> Ampicillin (originally branded as 'Penbritin') also demonstrated activity against Gram-negative organisms such as ''H. influenzae'', [[coliform]]s, and ''[[Proteus (bacterium)|Proteus]]'' spp.<ref name = acred/>

==Cost==
Its wholesale costs is between US$0.13 and 1.20 for a vial of the intravenous solution as of 2014.<ref name=Erc2015/> In the United States, it is available as a [[generic medication]] and 10 days of treatment cost about $13.<ref name=AHFS2015/>
