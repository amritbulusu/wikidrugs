<!-- *** For standardization ***
The neurotransmitter noradrenaline, mentioned many times in this article, is the same as norepinephrine (they're synonyms).
This article uses British English. Brits (I think) use the more common "noradrenaline" spelling, but I've made this article use only "norepinephrine" in order to keep consistency and not confuse readers (currently, no page exists for "Serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor"). Change this when and if you feel it should be changed, or if you feel I don't know what I'm talking about.

==Medical uses==
Venlafaxine is used primarily for the treatment of [[major depressive disorder|depression]], [[general anxiety disorder]], [[social phobia]], [[panic disorder]], and [[vasomotor symptoms]].<ref name=AHFS>{{cite web |title=venlafaxine-hydrochloride |url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/venlafaxine-hydrochloride.html |work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists |accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref> At low doses (<150&nbsp;mg/day), it acts only on serotonergic transmission. At moderate doses (>150&nbsp;mg/day), it acts on serotonergic and noradrenergic systems, whereas at high doses (>300&nbsp;mg/day), it also affects [[Dopamine transporter|dopaminergic neurotransmission]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Redrobe JP, Bourin M, Colombel MC, Baker GB | title = Dose-dependent noradrenergic and serotonergic properties of venlafaxine in animal models indicative of antidepressant activity | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 138 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–8 | date = July 1998 | pmid = 9694520 | doi = 10.1007/s002130050638 | url = https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s002130050638.pdf }}</ref>

Some doctors may prescribe venlafaxine [[Off-label use|off label]] for the treatment of [[diabetic neuropathy]] (in a similar manner to [[duloxetine]]) and [[migraine]] prophylaxis (in some people, however, venlafaxine can exacerbate or cause migraines). Studies have shown venlafaxine's effectiveness for these conditions,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Grothe DR, Scheckner B, Albano D | title = Treatment of pain syndromes with venlafaxine. | journal = Pharmacotherapy | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 621–9 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15162896 | doi = 10.1592/phco.24.6.621.34748 }}</ref> although agents that are marketed for this purpose (like [[pregabalin]] or [[duloxetine]]) are likely preferred. It has also been found to reduce the severity of 'hot flashes' in [[menopause|menopausal]] women and men on hormonal therapy for the treatment of prostate cancer.<ref>{{cite web |author=Mayo Clinic staff |year=2005 |title=Beyond hormone therapy: Other medicines may help |work=Hot flashes: Ease the discomfort of menopause |publisher=Mayo Clinic |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/invoke.cfm?id=HQ01409 |accessdate=19 August 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Schober CE, Ansani NT | title = Venlafaxine hydrochloride for the treatment of hot flashes | journal = The Annals of Pharmacotherapy | volume = 37 | issue = 11 | pages = 1703–7 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14565812 | doi = 10.1345/aph.1C483 }}</ref>

Due to its action on both the [[serotoninergic]] and [[adrenergic]] systems, venlafaxine is also used as a treatment to reduce episodes of [[cataplexy]], a form of muscle weakness, in patients with the [[sleep disorder]] [[narcolepsy]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Medications |work= |publisher=Stanford University School of Medicine, Center for Narcolepsy |date=7 February 2003 |url=http://med.stanford.edu/school/Psychiatry/narcolepsy/medications.html |doi= |accessdate=3 September 2007}}</ref> Some open-label and three double-blind studies have suggested the efficacy of venlafaxine in the treatment of [[attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ghanizadeh A, Freeman RD, Berk M | title = Efficacy and adverse effects of venlafaxine in children and adolescents with ADHD: a systematic review of non-controlled and controlled trials | journal = [[Reviews on recent clinical trials]] | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–8 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23157376 | doi = 10.2174/1574887111308010002 }}</ref> Clinical trials have found possible efficacy in those with [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Pae CU, Lim HK, Ajwani N, Lee C, Patkar AA | title = Extended-release formulation of venlafaxine in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. | journal = Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | pages = 603–15 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17563244 | doi = 10.1586/14737175.7.6.603 }}</ref>

===Depression===
Multiple [[double blind]] studies show venlafaxine's effectiveness in treating depression. Venlafaxine has similar efficacy to the [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s [[amitriptyline]] (Elavil) and [[imipramine]], and is better tolerated than amitriptyline. Its efficacy is similar to or better than [[sertraline]] (Zoloft) and [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac), depending on the criteria and rating scales used. Higher doses of venlafaxine are more effective, and more patients achieved [[Remission (medicine)|remission]] or were "very much improved". The efficacy was similar if the number of patients who achieved "response" or were "improved" was considered. A [[meta-analysis]] comparing venlafaxine and combined groups of [[SSRI]] or tricyclic antidepressants showed venlafaxine's superiority.<ref name="pmid11098413">{{cite journal |vauthors=Golden RN, Nicholas L | title = Antidepressant efficacy of venlafaxine | journal = Depression and Anxiety | volume = 12 Suppl 1 | issue =  | pages = 45–9 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11098413 | doi = 10.1002/1520-6394(2000)12:1+<45::AID-DA5>3.0.CO;2-5 }}</ref> Judged by the same criteria, venlafaxine was similar in efficacy to the atypical antidepressant [[bupropion]] (Wellbutrin); however, the remission rate was significantly lower for venlafaxine.<ref name="pmid16974189">{{cite journal |vauthors=Thase ME, Clayton AH, Haight BR, Thompson AH, Modell JG, Johnston JA | title = A double-blind comparison between bupropion XL and venlafaxine XR: sexual functioning, antidepressant efficacy, and tolerability | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology | volume = 26 | issue = 5 | pages = 482–8 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16974189 | doi = 10.1097/01.jcp.0000239790.83707.ab }}</ref> In a double-blind study, patients who did not respond to an SSRI were switched to venlafaxine or [[citalopram]].

===Suicide===
The US Food and Drug Administration body (FDA) requires all antidepressants, including venlafaxine, to carry a [[black box warning]] with a generic warning about a possible suicide risk.

A 2014 meta analysis of 21 clinical trials of venlafaxine for the treatment of depression in adults found that compared to placebo, venlafaxine reduced the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gibbons RD, Brown CH, Hur K, Davis J, Mann JJ | title = Suicidal thoughts and behavior with antidepressant treatment: reanalysis of the randomized placebo-controlled studies of fluoxetine and venlafaxine | journal = Arch. Gen. Psychiatry | volume = 69 | issue = 6 | pages = 580–7 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22309973 | pmc = 3367101 | doi = 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.2048 | url =  }}</ref>

A study conducted in Finland followed more than 15,000 patients for 3.4 years. Venlafaxine increased suicide risk by 60% (statistically significant), as compared to no treatment. At the same time, [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac) halved the suicide risk.<ref name="pmid17146010">{{cite journal |vauthors=Tiihonen J, Lönnqvist J, Wahlbeck K, Klaukka T, Tanskanen A, Haukka J | title = Antidepressants and the risk of suicide, attempted suicide, and overall mortality in a nationwide cohort | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 63 | issue = 12 | pages = 1358–67 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17146010 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.63.12.1358 | url = http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/data/Journals/PSYCH/5262/yoa60037_1358_1367.pdf | format = PDF }}</ref>

In another study, the data on more than 200,000 cases were obtained from the UK general practice research database. At baseline, patients prescribed venlafaxine had a greater number of risk factors for suicide (such as prior suicide attempts) than patients treated with other anti-depressants. The patients taking venlafaxine had significantly higher risk of completed suicide than the ones on [[fluoxetine]] or [[citalopram]] (Celexa).  After adjusting for known risk factors, venlafaxine was associated with an increased risk of suicide relative to fluoxetine and dothiepin that was not statistically significant. A statistically significant greater risk for attempted suicide remained after adjustment, but the authors concluded that it could be due to residual confounding.<ref name="pmid17164297">{{cite journal |vauthors=Rubino A, Roskell N, Tennis P, Mines D, Weich S, Andrews E | title = Risk of suicide during treatment with venlafaxine, citalopram, fluoxetine, and dothiepin: retrospective cohort study | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 334 | issue = 7587 | page = 242 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17164297 | pmc = 1790752 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.39041.445104.BE | url = http://www.bmj.com/highwire/filestream/340470/field_highwire_article_pdf/0/242.full.pdf | format = PDF }}</ref>

An analysis of clinical trials by the FDA statisticians showed the incidence of suicidal behaviour among the adults on venlafaxine to be not significantly different from fluoxetine or [[placebo]].<ref name=FDA>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/06/briefing/2006-4272b1-01-FDA.pdf |title=Overview for December 13 Meeting of Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee |accessdate=20 June 2007 |date=16 November 2006 |format=PDF |publisher=Food and Drug Administration: Center for Drug Evaluation and Research |pages= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316092329/http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/06/briefing/2006-4272b1-01-FDA.pdf |archivedate=16 March 2007 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

Venlafaxine is contraindicated in children, adolescents and young adults. According to the FDA analysis of clinical trials<ref name=FDA/> venlafaxine caused a statistically significant 5-fold increase in suicidal ideation and behaviour in persons younger than 25. In another analysis, venlafaxine was no better than placebo among children (7–11 years old), but improved depression in adolescents (12–17 years old). However, in both groups, hostility and suicidal behaviour increased in comparison to those receiving a placebo.<ref name="pmid17420682">{{cite journal |vauthors=Emslie GJ, Findling RL, Yeung PP, Kunz NR, Li Y | title = Venlafaxine ER for the treatment of pediatric subjects with depression: results of two placebo-controlled trials | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry | volume = 46 | issue = 4 | pages = 479–88 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17420682 | doi = 10.1097/chi.0b013e31802f5f03 }}</ref> In a study involving antidepressants that had failed to produce results in depressed teenagers, teens whose [[SSRI]] treatment had failed who were randomly switched to either another SSRI or to venlafaxine showed an increased rate of suicide on venlafaxine.

==Overdose==
Most patients overdosing with venlafaxine develop only mild symptoms.

There is no specific [[antidote]] for venlafaxine, and management is generally supportive, providing treatment for the immediate symptoms. Administration of [[activated charcoal]] can prevent absorption of the drug. Monitoring of cardiac rhythm and vital signs is indicated. Seizures are managed with [[benzodiazepine]]s or other anticonvulsants. [[Forced diuresis]], [[hemodialysis]], [[exchange transfusion]], or [[hemoperfusion]] are unlikely to be of benefit in hastening the removal of venlafaxine, due to the drug's high [[volume of distribution]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hanekamp BB, Zijlstra JG, Tulleken JE, Ligtenberg JJ, van der Werf TS, Hofstra LS | title = Serotonin syndrome and rhabdomyolysis in venlafaxine poisoning: a case report | journal = The Netherlands Journal of Medicine | volume = 63 | issue = 8 | pages = 316–8 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16186642 | url = http://www.njmonline.nl/getpdf.php?id=432 | format = PDF }}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
===Pharmacology===
Venlafaxine is usually categorized as a [[serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] (SNRI), but it has been referred to as a [[serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor]] (SNDRI).<ref>{{cite web |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |year=2008 |title=Acute Effectiveness of Additional Drugs to the Standard Treatment of Depression |publisher=ClinicalTrials.gov |url=http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00001483 |accessdate=21 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Goeringer KE, McIntyre IM, Drummer OH | title = Postmortem tissue concentrations of venlafaxine | journal = Forensic Science International | volume = 121 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 70–5 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11516890 | doi = 10.1016/S0379-0738(01)00455-8 }}</ref> It works by blocking the [[Monoamine transporter|transporter "reuptake" proteins]] for key [[neurotransmitter]]s affecting mood, thereby leaving more active neurotransmitters in the [[synapse]]. The neurotransmitters affected are [[serotonin]] and [[norepinephrine]]. Additionally, in high doses it weakly inhibits the reuptake of [[dopamine]],<ref name="CNSDrugs2001-Wellington">{{cite journal |vauthors=Wellington K, Perry CM | title = Venlafaxine extended-release: a review of its use in the management of major depression | journal = CNS Drugs | volume = 15 | issue = 8 | pages = 643–69 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11524036 | doi = 10.2165/00023210-200115080-00007 | url = https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.2165/00023210-200115080-00007.pdf | format = PDF }}</ref> with recent evidence showing that the [[norepinephrine transporter]] also transports some [[dopamine]] as well, since dopamine is inactivated by norepinephrine reuptake in the [[frontal cortex]].

Venlafaxine indirectly affects [[opioid receptor]]s (mu-, kappa1- kappa3- and delta-opioid receptor subtypes) as well as the alpha2-adrenergic receptor, and was shown to increase pain threshold in mice. When mice were tested with a hotplate analgesia meter (to measure pain), both venlafaxine and [[mirtazapine]] induced a dose-dependent, naloxone-reversible antinociceptive effect following [[intraperitoneal]] injection. These findings suggest venlafaxine's seemingly superior efficacy in severe depression as opioids become increasingly used as a measure of last resort for refractory cases.<ref>{{cite journal<!--

===Pharmacokinetics===
Venlafaxine is well absorbed, with at least 92% of an oral dose being absorbed into systemic circulation. It is extensively metabolized in the liver via the [[CYP2D6]] [[isoenzyme]] to [[desvenlafaxine]] (''O-desmethylvenlafaxine''), which is just as potent a SNRI as the parent compound, meaning that the differences in metabolism between extensive and [[poor metaboliser]]s are not clinically important in terms of efficacy. Side effects, however, are reported to be more severe in [[CYP2D6]] poor metabolisers.<ref name="JCPT JClinPharmTher2006-shams">{{cite journal | author = Shams ME, Arneth B, Hiemke C, Dragicevic A, Müller MJ, Kaiser R, Lackner K, Härtter S | title = CYP2D6 polymorphism and clinical effect of the antidepressant venlafaxine | journal = Journal of Clinical Pharmacy and Therapeutics | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 493–502 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 16958828 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2710.2006.00763.x | last2 = Arneth | last3 = Hiemke | last4 = Dragicevic | last5 = Müller | last6 = Kaiser | last7 = Lackner | last8 = Härtter }}</ref> Steady-state concentrations of venlafaxine and its [[metabolite]] are attained in the [[blood]] within 3 days.

==Chemistry==
The [[chemical structure]] of venlafaxine is designated (R/S)-1-[2-(dimethylamino)-1-(4 methoxyphenyl)ethyl] cyclohexanol hydrochloride or (±)-1-[a [a- (dimethylamino)methyl] p-methoxybenzyl] cyclohexanol hydrochloride, and it has the [[empirical formula]] of C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>27</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>. It is a white to off-white crystalline solid. Venlafaxine is structurally and pharmacologically related to the atypical opioid [[analgesic]] [[tramadol]], and more distantly to the newly released opioid [[tapentadol]], but not to any of the conventional antidepressant drugs, including [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s, SSRIs, MAOIs, or [[Reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A|RIMAs]].<ref name="QJM2003-Whyte">{{cite journal | author = Whyte IM, Dawson AH, Buckley NA | title = Relative toxicity of venlafaxine and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in overdose compared to tricyclic antidepressants | journal = QJM: Monthly Journal of the Association of Physicians | volume = 96 | issue = 5 | pages = 369–74 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12702786 | doi = 10.1093/qjmed/hcg062 | url = http://qjmed.oxfordjournals.org/content/96/5/369.full.pdf | format = PDF | last2 = Dawson | last3 = Buckley }}</ref>

Venlafaxine extended release is chemically the same as normal venlafaxine. The extended release (controlled release) version distributes the release of the drug into the [[gastrointestinal tract]] over a longer period than normal venlafaxine. This results in a lower peak plasma concentration. Studies have shown that the extended release formula has a lower incidence of [[nausea]] as a side effect, resulting in better compliance.<ref>{{cite journal | author = DeVane CL | title = Immediate-release versus controlled-release formulations: pharmacokinetics of newer antidepressants in relation to nausea | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 64 | issue = Suppl 18 | pages = 14–9 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14700450 }}</ref>
