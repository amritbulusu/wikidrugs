'''Pimobendan''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], or '''pimobendane'''; tradenames '''Vetmedin,''' '''Acardi''', and '''Heartmedin''') is a veterinary medication. It is a calcium sensitizer and a selective inhibitor of [[phosphodiesterase 3]] (PDE3) with positive [[inotropic]] and [[vasodilator]] effects.

Pimobendan is used in the management of [[heart failure]] in dogs, most commonly caused by myxomatous mitral valve disease (also previously known as endocardiosis), or [[dilated cardiomyopathy]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gordon SG, Miller MW, Saunders AB |title=Pimobendan in heart failure therapy—a silver bullet? |journal=J Am Anim Hosp Assoc |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=90–3 |year=2006 |pmid=16527909 |doi= |url=http://www.jaaha.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16527909}}</ref> Research has shown that as a monotherapy, pimobendan increases survival time and improves quality of life in canine patients with [[congestive heart failure]] secondary to mitral valve disease when compared with [[benazepril]], an [[ACE inhibitor|angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor]].<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Häggström J, Boswood A, O'Grady M, etal |title=Effect of Pimobendan or Benazepril Hydrochloride on Survival Times in Dogs with Congestive Heart Failure Caused by Naturally Occurring Myxomatous Mitral Valve Disease: The QUEST Study |journal=J.

Under the trade name Acardi, it is available for human use in [[Japan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rad-ar.or.jp/siori/english/kekka.cgi?n=54 |title=Kusuri-no-Shiori Drug Information Sheet |date=April 2005 |publisher=RAD-AR Council, Japan |accessdate=2008-08-06}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Pimobendan is a positive [[inotrope]] (increases myocardial contractility). It sensitizes and increases the binding efficiency of cardiac troponin in the [[myofibril]] to the calcium ions that are already present in systole. In normal hearts it increases the consumption of oxygen and energy to the same degree as dobutamine but in diseased hearts it may not.<ref>Hata K1, Goto Y, Futaki S, Ohgoshi Y, Yaku H, Kawaguchi O, Takasago T, Saeki A, Taylor TW, Nishioka T, et al. Mechanoenergetic effects of pimobendan in canine left ventricles. Comparison with dobutamine. Circulation. 1992 Oct;86(4):1291-301.</ref><ref>Goto Y1, Hata K. Mechanoenergetic effect of pimobendan in failing dog hearts. Heart Vessels. 1997;Suppl 12:103-5.</ref> Pimobendan also causes peripheral [[vasodilation]] by inhibiting the function of [[PDE3|phosphodiesterase III]]. This results in decreased resistance to blood flow through systemic arterioles, which decreases [[afterload]] (decreases the failing heart's workload) and reduces the amount of mitral regurgitation.<ref>Verdouw PD, Hartog JM, Duncker DJ, Roth W, Saxena PR. Cardiovascular profile of pimobendan, a benzimidazole-pyridazinone derivative with vasodilating and inotropic properties. Eur J Pharmacol. 1986 Jul 15;126(1-2):21-30.</ref><ref>Kanno N, Kuse H, Kawasaki M, Hara A, Kano R, Sasaki Y. Effects of pimobendan for mitral valve regurgitation in dogs. J Vet Med Sci. 2007 Apr;69(4):373-7.</ref>

==Pharmacokinetics==
Pimobendan is absorbed rapidly when given via the oral route and has a [[bioavailability]] of 60-65%.<ref>http://www.vetmedin.com/Vetmedin%20Insert_6-07.pdf</ref> Bioavailability is markedly decreased when ingested with food. It is metabolized into an active metabolite (desmethylpimobendan) by the [[liver]]. The parent compound, pimobendan, is a potent calcium sensitizer while desmethylpimobendan is a more potent phosphodiesterase III inhibitor.<ref>Hanzlicek AS1, Gehring R, Kukanich B, Kukanich KS, Borgarelli M, Smee N, Olson EE, Margiocco M. Pharmacokinetics of oral pimobendan in healthy cats. J Vet Cardiol. 2012 Dec;14(4):489-96.</ref> The [[half-life]] of pimobendan in the blood is 0.4 hours and the half-life of its metabolite is 2 hours. Elimination is by excretion in the bile and then feces. Pimobendan is 90–95% [[plasma protein binding|bound to plasma proteins]] in circulation. This may have implications in patients suffering from low blood protein levels ([[hypoproteinemia]]/[[hypoalbuminemia]]) and in patients that are on concurrent therapies that are also highly protein bound.

==Combinations==
Pimobendan is often used in combination with three other drugs to palliate dogs with heart failure (pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, ascites). These are:
* [[Furosemide]], a diuretic, to reduce [[edema]] and effusion.
* [[Spironolactone]], an [[aldosterone antagonist]]. This has two actions, firstly, as a [[potassium-sparing diuretic]], although its diuretic properties are small compared with those of furosemide. Secondly, it reduces aldosterone-mediated myocardial fibrosis, possibly slowing the progression of heart disease.
*An [[ACE inhibitor]], often [[enalapril]] (trade name Enacard) or [[benazepril]] (Fortekor). These drugs inhibit the action of [[angiotensin-converting enzyme]], producing a balanced vasodilation, along with other potentially favorable effects.

Other drugs may also be used as required to manage certain [[arrhythmias]] that are often associated with heart disease.
