'''Cortisporin''' is a drug consisting of [[Neomycin]], [[bacitracin]], [[polymyxin B]] and [[hydrocortisone]]. It is a combination [[antibiotic]] and cortisone-like medicine. It can be used to treat infections of the [[ear canal]] and to help provide relief from redness, [[irritation]], and discomfort of certain ear problems, including so-called [[swimmer's ear]].  In 2016, the drug came under scrutiny when [[Los Angeles Times]] columnist [[David Lazarus]] highlighted it as an example of unwarranted drug price markups by pharmaceutical companies.<ref name=latimes>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-lazarus-shkreli-20160204-column.html |title=Martin Shkreli isn't alone in ripping off patients with crazy drug prices |publisher=latimes.com |first=David|last=Lazarus|date=2016-02-04 |accessdate=2016-02-05}}</ref>  The drug is owned by Dublin, Ireland-based [[Endo International]].

==History==
Cortisporin was developed by [[Glaxo Wellcome]] and was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] in 1975.  In 1997, the rights were sold to Monarch Pharmaceuticals, a division of [[King Pharmaceuticals]].  In 2007, King sold it to JHP Pharmaceuticals.  [[Par Pharmaceutical]] acquired JHP in 2014.  In 2015, Endo International purchased Par.<ref name ="latimes"/>

===Price history===
In David Lazarus' February 4, 2016 LA Times column, a pharmacist recalled a 10 milliliter vial of the drug selling for around $10 in the early 2010s.  In 2015, the price was $100, and in 2016, it reportedly was selling for $195.  A generic version, which is thinner and reportedly doesn't work as well, is priced at $144.<ref name ="latimes"/>
