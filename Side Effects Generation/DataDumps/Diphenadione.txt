'''Diphenadione''' is a [[vitamin K antagonist]] that has [[anticoagulant]] effects and is used as a [[rodenticide]] against rats, mice, voles, ground squirrels and other rodents.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The [[chemical compound]] is an [[anti-coagulant]] with active half-life{{verification needed|date=April 2016}} longer than [[warfarin]] and other synthetic [[indandione]] anticoagulants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/extoxnet/dienochlor-glyphosate/diphacinone-ext.html |title=Diphacinone |author = EXTOXNET Staff | publisher= EXTOXNET |date= 1993-09-01 | accessdate=2011-12-07}}{{Update inline|date=April 2016}}</ref>{{better source|date=April 2016}}
