'''Vosaroxin''' ('''AG-7352''', '''SPC-595''', '''SNS 595''', '''voreloxin''') is a [[Type II topoisomerase|topoisomerase II]] [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] causing site-selective [[DNA damage]]. It is under phase III clinical trial investigation for [[acute myelogenous leukemia]] (AML) and [[ovarian cancer]] sponsored by [[Sunesis Pharmaceuticals|Sunesis]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Vosaroxin  | publisher = Selleck Chemicals|url=http://www.selleckchem.com/products/voreloxin-sns-595.html}}</ref>

== Mechanism of action==
Vosaroxin is a [[naphthyridine]] [[structural analog|analog]] of the anticancer [[quinolone]] derivatives (AQDs), a class of compounds that has not been used previously for the treatment of cancer. Topoisomerase II enzymes are essential for the survival of [[eukaryotic cell]]s. Vosaroxin hinders the reunion of topoisomerase II-induced double-strand breaks at selective sites in [[DNA]], resulting in [[G2 phase|G2 arrest]] and cell death by [[apoptosis]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Vosaroxin (Formerly Voreloxin) | publisher = Sunesis | url=http://www.sunesis.com/products-in-development/product/Vosaroxin.php}}</ref>
