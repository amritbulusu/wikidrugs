'''Tifluadom'''<ref>US Patent 4325957</ref> is a [[benzodiazepine]] derivative with an unusual activity profile. Unlike most benzodiazepines, tifluadom has no activity at the [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor]], but instead is a selective [[agonist]] for the [[Kappa opioid receptor|κ-opioid receptor]].<ref>Romer D, Buscher HH, Hill RC, Maurer R, Petcher TJ, Zeugner H, Benson W, Finner E, Milkowski W, Thies PW.

While tifluadom has several effects which might have potential uses in medicine such as analgesia and appetite stimulation, κ-opioid agonists tend to produce undesirable effects in humans such as [[dysphoria]] and [[hallucinations]], and so these drugs tend to only be used in [[scientific research]]. Dysphoric effects are similar to those seen when using other κ-opioid receptor agonists like [[pentazocine]] and [[salvinorin A]], and can be considered the opposite of morphine-induced euphoria. As such, kappa agonists are believed to have very limited abuse potential.
