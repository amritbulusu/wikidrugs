'''Apremilast''' (brand name '''Otezla''') is a medication for the treatment of certain types of [[psoriasis]] and [[psoriatic arthritis]]. It may also be useful for other immune system related inflammatory diseases. The drug acts as a selective inhibitor of the enzyme [[phosphodiesterase 4]] (PDE4) and inhibits spontaneous production of [[Tumor necrosis factor alpha|TNF-alpha]] from human [[rheumatoid synovial cell]]s.<ref>[http://www.adooq.com/apremilast-cc-10004.html Apremilast]</ref> It is taken by mouth.

==Medical use==
Apremilast was approved by the [[United States]] [[Food and Drug Administration]] in 2014 for treatment of adults with active [[psoriatic arthritis]] and moderate to severe [[plaque psoriasis]].<ref name="fda">[http://ir.celgene.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=872240 "Oral Otezla (apremilast) Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the Treatment of Patients with Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis"] (Press release). Celgene Corporation. 23 September 2014. Retrieved 29 October 2014.</ref><ref>[http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm390091.htm FDA approves Otezla to treat psoriatic arthritis]</ref> Apremilast, like [[methotrexate]], is taken by mouth.<ref name="oral">[http://www.rheumatology.org/Publications/Hotline/Apremilast_for_the_Treatment_of_Psoriatic_Arthritis/ Apremilast for the Treatment of Psoriatic Arthritis]  American College of Rheumatology (14 June 2014). Retrieved 29 October 2014.</ref>

==Contraindications==
In Europe, the drug is contraindicated during pregnancy because mice and monkeys receiving very high doses of apremilast have been observed to suffer [[miscarriage]]s and other pregnancy problems.<ref name="AC">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2015|language=German}}</ref> In the U.S., it may be used for pregnant women "if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus".<ref>[[Drugs.com]]: Otezla {{Drugs.com|pregnancy|otezla}}.</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Common, usually mild to moderate adverse effects associated with apremilast include headache, back pain, nausea, diarrhea, [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[nasopharyngitis]] and [[upper respiratory tract infections]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mease|first=PJ|author2=Armstrong, AW|title=Managing Patients with Psoriatic Disease: The Diagnosis and Pharmacologic Treatment of Psoriatic Arthritis in Patients with Psoriasis|journal=Drugs|date=25 February 2014|volume=74|issue=4|pages=423–41|pmid=24566842|doi=10.1007/s40265-014-0191-y|pmc=3958815}}</ref>

Other side effects include:
* Depression: Worsening depression, suicidal thoughts, and other mood changes may occur with apremilast.<ref name = "pi">[http://www.otezla.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/otezla-prescribing-information.pdf "Otezla (Prescribing Information)"]. Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ; March 2014. Retrieved 29 October 2014.</ref>
* Weight loss: Weight loss has been associated with apremilast. Reports from clinical studies indicated a 5 to 10% decrease in body weight in 10% of patients taking apremilast (compared to 3.3% of patients taking placebo).<ref name = "pi"/>

==Interactions==
Concurrent use of strong [[cytochrome P450]] enzyme inducers has been shown to decrease exposure of apremilast and can result in reduced or loss of efficacy of apremilast. It is not recommended to use simultaneously with strong P450 enzyme inducers, including [[rifampicin]], [[phenobarbital]], [[carbamazepine]], [[phenytoin]],<ref name = "pi"/> and [[St. John's Wort]].<ref>{{cite web|title=OTEZLA Product Monograph|url=http://www.celgenecanada.net/pdfs/Otezla_Product_Monograph_English_Version.pdf|website=Celgene Canada|publisher=Celgene Corporation|accessdate=3 April 2015}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
Apremilast is a [[small molecule]] inhibitor of PDE4,<ref>{{Drugs.com|pro|otezla}} for Otezla.</ref> an enzyme that breaks down [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate]] (cAMP). In inflammatory cells, PDE4 is the dominant enzyme responsible for this reaction. The resulting increase in cAMP levels down-regulates expression of a number of pro-inflammatory factors like [[tumor necrosis factor alpha]] (TNFα), [[interleukin 17]], [[interleukin 23]], and many others, and up-regulates the anti-inflammatory [[interleukin 10]]. The importance of these individual factors for the clinical effect of apremilast is not clear.<ref name="AC" />

===Pharmacokinetics===
Apremilast is absorbed from the gut well (73%) and independently of food intake, and reaches peak [[blood plasma]] concentrations after 2.5 hours. [[Plasma protein binding]] is 68%. It is metabolised in the liver, mainly via the enzyme [[CYP3A4]], but to a minor extent via [[CYP1A2]] and [[CYP2A6]]. The main [[metabolite]] is ''O''-desmethylapremilast [[glucuronide]].<ref name = MSR /><ref name="AC" />

The half-life is 6–9 hours. The substance is eliminated through the kidney (58%) and feces (39%), mainly in form of its metabolites. Only 3% of the original substance are found in the urine, and 7% in the feces.<ref name = MSR /><ref name="AC" />

==Chemistry==
Apremilast is a [[phthalimide]] derivative. It is a white to pale yellow, non-[[hygroscopic]] powder that is practically insoluble in water and [[buffer solution]]s in a wide [[pH]] range, but is soluble in [[lipophilic]] solvents such as [[acetone]], [[acetonitrile]], [[butanone]], [[dichloromethane]], and [[tetrahydrofuran]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Public_assessment_report/human/003746/WC500182629.pdf|title=Assessment report for Otezla|publisher=EMA|date=20 November 2014}}</ref>

[[Celgene]] reported seven kinds of [[Crystal structure|crystal form]] A, B, C, D, E, F, and G and thought the crystal form B was the most [[thermodynamic stability|thermodynamically stable]] anhydrous form. However, [[Utopharm]] reported another more thermodynamically stable anhydrous crystal form II than the crystal form B.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utopharm.com/youchuo_en/news_sub.aspx?id=61 |title=A novel stable and non-solvate crystal form II on Apremilast and processes for the preparation thereof |publisher=Utopharm |date=2015-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531020846/http://www.utopharm.com/youchuo_en/news_sub.aspx?id=61 |archivedate=31 May 2015 }}</ref>

==Accessibility==
Otezla is available in the U.S., but is dispensed only through a network of specialty pharmacies.<ref name="fda"/> The estimated wholesale price is $22,500 for a year of treatment.<ref name="oral"/> In Austria, the drug is available in all pharmacies, and a year of treatment costs health insurances about €11,000.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Warenverzeichnis|volume=I|date=January 2016|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|language=de}}</ref>
