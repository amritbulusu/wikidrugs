'''Zomepirac''' is an orally effective [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] (NSAID) that has [[antipyretic]] actions. It was developed by  [[McNeil Laboratories|McNeil Pharmaceutical]], approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] in 1980, and sold as the sodium salt zomepirac sodium, under the brand name '''Zomax'''. Due to its clinical effectiveness, it was preferred by doctors in many situations and obtained a large share of the analgesics market; however, it was subsequently withdrawn in March 1983 due to its tendency to cause serious [[anaphylaxis]] in an unpredictable subset of the patient population.<ref>[[Peter Rheinstein|Peter H.

== Chemical structure ==
Zomepirac is the sodium salt of 5-(4-chlorobenzoyl)-1,4 dimethyl-1''H''-pyrrole-2-acetate dihydrate.  It is a [[pyrrole]]-[[acetic acid]] which is structurally related to [[tolmetin]].  The chemical structure differs from other NSAIDs in that the central benzene ring has been replaced by a pyrrole.

== Mechanism of action ==
Zomepirac is a [[prostaglandin synthetase]] [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]].<ref>DC McLeod, [http://www.theannals.com/cgi/content/abstract/15/7/522 Zomepirac (Zomax, McNeil Pharmaceutical)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928041224/http://www.theannals.com/cgi/content/abstract/15/7/522 |date=September 28, 2007 }}, ''Drug Intelligence & Clinical Pharmacy'': Vol. 15, No. 7, pp. 522-530.</ref>

== Toxicity ==
Zomepirac does not cause anaphylaxis directly, but it is metabolized by [[UDP-glucuronosyltransferase]] (UGT) to a reactive [[glucuronide]] which binds irreversibly to plasma [[albumin]].<ref name="Smith1986">{{cite journal|last1= Smith|first1=P. C.|last2= McDonagh|first2=A. F.|last3= Benet|first3=L. Z.|author3-link= Leslie Z. Benet|title= Irreversible binding of zomepirac to plasma protein ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo''|journal= Journal of Clinical Investigation|volume= 77|issue= 3|year= 1986|pages= 934–939|doi= 10.1172/JCI112392|pmid= 3949982|pmc= 423485 }}</ref>

== Synthesis ==
Zomepirac can be synthesized from diethyl 1,3-acetonedicarboxylate, [[chloroacetone]], and aqueous [[methylamine]] (MeNH<sub>2</sub>) via modification of the [[Hantzsch pyrrole synthesis]] to give intermediate '''1'''. Saponification, monoesterification, and thermal decarboxylation gives ester '''2'''. This is acylated with ''N'',''N''-dimethyl-''p''-chlorobenzamide, and finally [[saponification]] gives zomepirac ('''3''').
