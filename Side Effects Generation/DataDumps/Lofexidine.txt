'''Lofexidine''' (sold under the brand names: '''BritLofex''' and '''Kai Er Ding''') is an [[alpha-2A adrenergic receptor|α<sub>2A</sub> adrenergic receptor]] agonist, historically used as an [[Antihypertensive drug|antihypertensive]], but more commonly used to alleviate the physical symptoms of [[heroin]] and other types of [[opioid]] withdrawal.<ref name = BNF/>

==Indication==
In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[hydrochloride]] form, lofexidine HCl, has been licensed and sold since 1992 for opiate withdrawal relief in tablet form as BritLofex by Britannia Pharmaceuticals.<ref name = BNF/> BritLofex is only available by [[medical prescription|prescription]]. Lofexidine is also commonly used in conjunction with the opioid receptor antagonist [[naltrexone]] in rapid detoxification cases. When these two drugs are paired, naltrexone is administered to induce an opioid-receptor blockade sending the subject into immediate withdrawal and accelerating the [[Drug detoxification|detoxification]] process, while lofexidine is given to relieve the symptoms associated with the withdrawal including chills, sweating, stomach cramps, muscle pain, and runny nose.

Lofexidine inhibits the release of [[norepinephrine]] in the central and peripheral nervous system, thereby reducing some of the withdrawal symptoms, but it has no documented effect on drug [[Craving (withdrawal)|craving]] and [[endogenous opioid]] levels.<ref name="BNF">{{cite book | isbn = 978-0-85711-084-8 | title = British National Formulary (BNF) | last1 = Joint Formulary Committee | year = 2013 | publisher = Pharmaceutical Press | location = London, UK | edition = 65 | page = 330  }}</ref>

==Use in opioid detoxification==
Lofexidine is not an opioid, whereas methadone is. Some opioid detox programs use methadone in decreasing amounts in their detox protocol, whereas other detox programs use lofexidine. The drugs are completely chemically unrelated, and their physiological effects are completely unrelated, although both are used as part of an opioid detoxification protocol. Whereas lofexidine cannot stop opioid withdrawal and merely eases some symptoms of withdrawal, methadone—being an opioid itself—will completely ameliorate all withdrawal symptoms in a sufficient dose. Indeed, one suggested use for lofexidine is to ease withdrawal symptoms of methadone dependence. While abstaining from opiates and taking lofexidine, effective detoxification can succeed in as little as 3 days,<ref name=gerra>G. Gerra, et al., Lofexidine versus clonidine in rapid opiate detoxification, Journal of Substance Abuse TreatmentVolume 21, Issue 1, , July 2001, Pages 11-17.</ref> although the standard duration of detoxification using lofexidine is 10 days.<ref>J. Bearn, M. Gossop, J. Strang, Drug Alcohol Depend. 43, 87 (1996)</ref> The {{LD50}} of lofexidine is 77&nbsp;mg/kg. Lofexidine is not currently available in the [[United States]].  Britannia Pharmaceuticals has licensed lofexidine to be sold by US World Meds for sale in North America,<ref>[http://www.britannia-pharm.co.uk/ Britannia Pharmaceuticals Limited<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and clinical trials are currently underway to secure approval for sale in the United States by the [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).<ref>[http://www.usworldmeds.com/lofexidine.htm US WorldMeds | +1 502 893 3235<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
 
An additional benefit of lofexidine treatment is that it is given as part of an [[outpatient]], or ambulatory regimen, and can be completed without a hospital stay.  This reduces costs for both healthcare provider and patient, and keeps specialist hospital beds free for particularly difficult withdrawal cases.

==Structural similarities to clonidine==
[[Image:Clonidine and lofexidine.svg|thumb|350px|right|Structure of clonidine and lofexidine]]
Lofexidine is structurally analogous to [[clonidine]], another α<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptor agonist used for treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms. A comparison of the two structures is shown at right. Both contain an [[imidazole]] ring and a 2,6-dichlorinated [[phenyl]] ring. The differences in structure are shown in red, while the similarities are in black. In addition to the structural differences, administration of lofexidine in heroin addicts has been shown to be more effective for a longer duration, with fewer withdrawal symptoms than clonidine even after one day.<ref name=gerra/> However, clonidine is often preferred as it is substantially cheaper than lofexidine when purchased with a private (non-NHS) prescription. This factor is exacerbated by the considerable number of and quantities of medications prescribed to alleviate the constellation of withdrawal signs and symptoms. Additionally, clonidine has been shown to significantly lower blood pressure. Therefore, although similar to lofexidine, clonidine is most frequently prescribed to treat [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]].

==Other clinical uses==
The possibility of using lofexidine to treat alcohol addiction withdrawal symptoms has been investigated, and has not yet been shown to be an effective treatment.<ref>Keaney F, Strang J, Gossop M, Marshall EJ, Farrell M, Welch S, Hahn B, Gonzalez A. A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial of lofexidine in alcohol withdrawal: lofexidine is not a useful adjunct to chlordiazepoxide. Alcohol Alcohol (2001) 36:426–30.</ref> It is also used in treatment of cases suffering from postmenopausal [[Hot flash|hot flush]]es.
