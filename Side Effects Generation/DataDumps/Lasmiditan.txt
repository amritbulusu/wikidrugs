'''Lasmiditan''' ('''COL-144''') is an investigational drug for the treatment of acute [[migraine]]. It is being developed by [[Eli Lilly]] and is in phase III [[clinical trial]]s. It is a first-in-class "neurally acting anti-migraine agent" [[ditan]].

==Mechanism of action==
Lasmiditan is a [[serotonin receptor agonist]] that, like the unsuccessful [[LY-334,370]], selectively binds to the [[5-HT1F receptor|5-HT<sub>1F</sub> receptor]] subtype. A number of [[triptan]]s have been shown to act on this subtype as well, but only after their affinity for [[5-HT1B receptor|5-HT<sub>1B</sub>]] and [[5-HT1D receptor|5-HT<sub>1D</sub>]] has been made responsible for their anti-migraine activity. The lack of affinity for these receptors might result in fewer side effects related to [[vasoconstriction]] compared to triptans in susceptible patients, such as those with [[ischemic heart disease]], [[Raynaud's phenomenon]] or after a [[myocardial infarction]],<ref name="Prous" /> although a 1998 review has found such side-effects to rarely occur in patients taking triptans.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Dahlöf | first1 = CG | last2 = Mathew | first2 = N | title = Cardiovascular safety of 5HT1B/1D agonists--is there a cause for concern? | journal = Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache | volume = 18 | issue = 8 | pages = 539–45 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9827245| doi=10.1046/j.1468-2982.1998.1808539.x}}</ref><ref name="Mutschler" />

== Discovery and development ==
Lasmiditan was discovered by [[Eli Lilly and Company]] and was out-licensed to [[CoLucid Pharmaceuticals]] in 2006, until CoLucid was bought by Eli Lilly in 2017 to reacquire the drug.<ref>http://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/lilly-buys-migraine-biotech-colucid-for-960m-and-drug-it-out-licensed</ref> The drug is protected by patents until 2031.<ref name="adisinsight">http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800028519</ref>

Phase II clinical trials for dose finding purposes were completed in 2007 for an intravenous form<ref name="NCT00384774" /> and in early 2010 for an oral form.<ref name="NCT00883051" /> Two separate Phase III clinical trials for the oral version are currently ongoing under special protocol agreements with the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). Eli Lilly has stated that they intend to submit a [[new drug application]] to the FDA in early 2018.<ref name="adisinsight" />

As of 2017, three phase III clinical trials have been completed or are in progress. The SPARTAN trial compares placebo with 50, 100, and 200&nbsp;mg of lasmiditan.<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT02605174|Three Doses of Lasmiditan (50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg) Compared to Placebo in the Acute Treatment of Migraine (SPARTAN)}}</ref> SAMURAI compared placebo with 100 and 200 mg doses of lasmidatin. In 2016, CoLucid announced that the trial had met its primary and secondary endpoints of patients being pain-free two hours after dosing.<ref name="adisinsight" /> GLADIATOR is an [[open-label]] study comparing 100 and 200&nbsp;mg doses of lasmidatin in patients that received the drug as part of a prior trial.<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT02565186|An Open-label, Long-term, Safety Study of Lasmiditan for the Acute Treatment of Migraine (GLADIATOR)}}</ref> In August of 2017 topline results from the SPARTAN trial showed that the drug induced met its primary and secondary endpoints in the trial. The primary result showed a statistically significant improvement in pain relief relative to placebo 2 hours after the first dose. The secondary result showed a statistically significantly greater percentage of patients were free of their most bothersome symptom (MBS) compared with placebo at two hours following the first dose. <ref>https://investor.lilly.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=1036101</ref>
