'''Lomustine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]), abbreviated '''CCNU''' (original brand name (formerly available) is '''CeeNU''', now marketed as '''Gleostine'''), is an [[alkylating antineoplastic agent|alkylating]] [[nitrosourea compounds|nitrosourea compound]] used in [[chemotherapy]]. It is closely related to [[semustine]] and is in the same family as [[streptozotocin]]. It is a highly lipid-soluble drug<ref name = "Drug Manual">{{cite web | title = BC Cancer Agency Cancer Drug Manual. Lomustine (CCNU; CeeNU) | url = http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/drug-database-site/Drug%20Index/Lomustine_monograph_1Apr07.pdf | accessdate = 15 July 2016}}</ref> and thus crosses the [[blood-brain barrier]]. This property makes it ideal for treating [[brain tumor]]s, which is its primary use. Lomustine has a long time to nadir (the time when [[white blood cell]]s reach their lowest number).

Unlike [[carmustine]], lomustine is administered orally. It is a monofunctional alkylating agent, alkylates both [[DNA]] and [[RNA]], has the ability to cross-link DNA.<ref>{{cite book | editor1-last = Pizzo | editor1-first = PA | editor2-last = Poplack | editor2-first = DG | title = Principles and Practice of Pediatric Oncology | date = 2006 | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | location = Philadelphia | isbn = 9780781754927 | page = 300 | edition = 5 | accessdate = 15 July 2016}}</ref> As with other nitrosoureas, it may also inhibit several key enzymatic processes by carbamoylation of amino acids in proteins.<ref name="PI">{{cite web | title = Gleostine (lomustine) Capsules, for Oral Use.

In 2014, the drug was re-launched and rebranded as Gleostine, manufactured by NextSource Biotechnology.<ref>{{cite web | title = NextSource Biotechnology Gains FDA Approval for Use of Tradename Gleostine (lomustine), an Anti-Cancer Chemotherapy Agent | url = http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nextsource-biotechnology-gains-fda-approval-for-use-of-tradename-gleostine-lomustine-an-anti-cancer-chemotherapy-agent-270367311.html | website = www.prnewswire.com | publisher = NextSource Biotechnology | accessdate = 15 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Gleostine (lomustine) Capsules — Healthcare Providers | url = http://www.nextsourcebiotechnology.com/products/gleostine.aspx | publisher = NextSource Biotechnology | accessdate = 15 July 2016}}</ref>
