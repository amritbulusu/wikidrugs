Some sources regard clotiapine as a [[typical antipsychotic]] rather than [[Atypical antipsychotic|atypical]] due to its high incidence of [[extrapyramidal side effects]] compared to the atypicals like [[clozapine]] and [[quetiapine]], to which it is structurally related.<ref name = ClotChlor>{{cite journal|title=Clotiapine compared with chlorpromazine in chronic schizophrenia|journal=Schizophrenia Research|volume=80|issue=2–3|pages=343–347|author1=Geller, V |author2=Gorzaltsan, I |author3=Shleifer, T |author4=Belmaker, RH |author5=Bersudsky, Y |pmid=16126373|date=December 2005|doi=10.1016/j.schres.2005.07.007}}</ref> Despite its profile of a relatively high incidence of extrapyramidal side effects it has demonstrated efficacy in treatment-resistant individuals with schizophrenia according to a number of psychiatrists with clinical experience with it, some weak clinical evidence supports this view too.<ref name = forg>{{cite journal|title=Clotiapine: Another forgotten treasure in psychiatry?|journal=European Neuropsychopharmacology|volume=7|issue=Suppl 2|pages=S217|doi=10.1016/S0924-977X(97)88712-3|date=September 1997|author1=Lokshin, P |author2=Kotler, M |author3=Belmaker, RH }}</ref><ref name = ClotChlor/><ref>{{cite journal|title=chlorpromazine, clotiapine and thioridazine--a comparative clinical trial on Bantu psychotic patients|journal=South African Medical Journal|date=August 1971|volume=45|issue=34|pages=945–947|pmid=4939661|url=http://archive.samj.org.za/1971%20VOL%20XLV%20Jul-Dec/Articles/08%20August/4.3%20CHLORPROMOZAINE,%20CLOTIAPINE%20AND%20THIORIDAZINE%20-%20A%20COMPARATIVE%20CLINICAL%20TRIAL%20AND%20BANTU%20PSYCHOT.pdf|format=PDF|author1=Van Wyk, AJ |author2=Marais, GF }}</ref> A [[systematic review]] compared clotiapine with other antipsychotic drugs:

|-
| No significant improvement || There is no clear difference between people given clotiapine and those receiving other antipsychotic drugs for acute psychotic illnesses. These findings are based on data of low quality.
 || [[Relative risk|RR]] 0.88 (0.39 to 1.98) || [[The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach|Low]]
|-
| Not well enough to be discharged || Clotiapine is not clearly different to other antipsychotic drugs for this outcome - for people who are acutely unwell. These findings are based on data of low quality.
 || RR 1.04 (0.93 to 1.16) || [[The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach|Low]]
|-
! colspan="4" style="text-align: left;"| [[Adverse event|Adverse effects]]
|-
| Movement disorders - use of antiparkinsonian medication || Clotiapine may reduce the use of antiparkinsonian drugs - implying that clotiapine causes less of this effect, but, at present it is not possible to be confident about the difference between the two treatments and data supporting this finding are very limited.
 || RR 0.43 (0.05 to 3.53) || [[The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach|Very low]]
|-
| Seizure || Clotiapine may increase the risk of fits, but, the difference between the two treatments is not clear. This finding is based on data of low quality.
 || RR 3.67 (0.16 to 84.66) || [[The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach|Low]]
|-

| Leaving the study early - any reason || There is no clear difference between people given clotiapine and those receiving other antipsychotics for acute psychotic illnesses. These findings are based on data of low quality. 
 || RR 2.09 (0.81 to 5.42) || [[The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach|Low]]
