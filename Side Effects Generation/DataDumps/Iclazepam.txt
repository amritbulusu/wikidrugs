'''Iclazepam''' ('''Clazepam''') is a drug which is a [[benzodiazepine]] derivative. It has [[sedative]] and [[anxiolytic]] effects similar to those produced by other benzodiazepine derivatives, and is around the same potency as [[chlordiazepoxide]].

Iclazepam is a derivative of [[nordazepam]] substituted with a cyclopropylmethoxyethyl group on the ''N''<sup>1</sup> nitrogen. Once in the body, iclazepam is quickly metabolised to [[nordazepam]] and its ''N''-(2-hydroxyethyl) derivative, which are thought to be mainly responsible for its effects.<ref>Giudicelli JF, Berdeaux A, Idrissi N, Richer C.
