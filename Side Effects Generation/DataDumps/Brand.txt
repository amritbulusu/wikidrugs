A '''brand''' is a name, term, design, symbol, or other feature that distinguishes an organization or product from its rivals in the eyes of the customer.<ref>[[American Marketing Association]] [http://www.marketingpower.com/_layouts/Dictionary.aspx?dLetter=B Dictionary]. Retrieved 2011-06-29.

The practice of branding is thought to have begun with the ancient Egyptians who were known to have engaged in [[livestock branding]] as early as 2,700 BC.<ref>Wheeler, H., ''The Miracle Of Man,'' London, Longacre, 1946, p. 84.</ref> Branding was used to differentiate one person’s cattle from another's by means of a distinctive symbol burned into the animal’s skin with a hot [[branding iron]]. If a person would steal the animals, anyone could detect the symbol and deduce the actual owner. However, the term has been extended to mean a strategic personality for a product or company, so that ‘brand’ now suggests the values and promises that a consumer may perceive and buy into. Over time, the practice of branding objects extended to a broader range of packaging and goods offered for sale including oil, wine, cosmetics and fish sauce.

'''Branding''' is a set of [[marketing]] and communication methods that help to distinguish a [[company]] or products from competitors, aiming to create a lasting impression in the minds of [[customer]]s. The key components that form a brand's toolbox include a brand’s identity, brand communication (such as by [[logo]]s and [[trademark]]s), [[brand awareness]], [[brand loyalty]], and various branding ([[brand management]]) strategies.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal|last=Bhimrao M. Ghodeswar|date=2008-02-29|title=Building brand identity in competitive markets: a conceptual model|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/10610420810856468|journal=Journal of Product & Brand Management|volume=17|issue=1|pages=4–12|doi=10.1108/10610420810856468|issn=1061-0421}}</ref>

[[Brand equity]] is the measurable totality of a brand's worth and is validated by assessing the effectiveness of these branding components.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal|last=Keller|first=Kevin Lane|date=1993-01-01|title=Conceptualizing, Measuring, and Managing Customer-Based Brand Equity|jstor=1252054|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume=57|issue=1|pages=1–22|doi=10.2307/1252054}}</ref> As markets become increasingly dynamic and fluctuating, brand equity is a marketing technique to increase customer satisfaction and customer loyalty, with side effects like reduced price sensitivity.<ref name=":0"/> A brand is in essence a promise to its customers of they can expect from their products, as well as emotional benefits.<ref name=":0"/> When a customer is familiar with a brand, or favours it incomparably to its competitors, this is when a corporation has reached a high level of brand equity.<ref name=":1"/>

Many companies believe that there is often little to differentiate between several types of products in the 21st century, and therefore branding is one of a few remaining forms of [[product differentiation]].<ref>ranchhod, 2004</ref>

In accounting, a brand defined as an [[intangible asset]] is often the most valuable asset on a corporation’s balance sheet. Brand owners manage their brands carefully to create shareholder value, and [[brand valuation]] is an important management technique that ascribes a money value to a brand, and allows marketing investment to be managed (e.g.: prioritized across a portfolio of brands) to maximize shareholder value. Although only acquired brands appear on a company's balance sheet, the notion of putting a value on a brand forces marketing leaders to be focused on long term stewardship of the brand and managing for value.

The word ‘brand’ is often used as a [[Metonymy|metonym]] referring to the company that is strongly identified with a brand.

[[wikt:marque|Marque]] or [[wikt:make|make]] are often used to denote a brand of [[motor vehicle]], which may be distinguished from a [[car model]]. A ''concept brand'' is a brand that is associated with an abstract concept, like [[breast cancer awareness]] or [[environmentalism]], rather than a specific product, service, or business. A ''commodity brand'' is a brand associated with a [[commodity]].

==Etymology==
The word, ''brand'', derives from the ancient North Scandavian term “brandr” meaning "to burn."  It is a reference to the practice of using branding irons to burn a mark into the hides of livestock, and may also refer to the practice of craftsmen engraving brand names into products, tools or personal belongings.<ref>Briciu, V.A, and Briciu, A., "A Brief History of Brands and the Evolution of Branding," Bulletin of the Transilvania University of Braşov [Series VII: Social Sciences], Vol. 9 (58) No. 2 2016, p.137 <Online: http://webbut.unitbv.ro/bulletin/Series%20VII/BULETIN%20I/22_Briciu.pdf</ref>

==History==
[[File:Amphorae for wine and oil, Archaeological Museum, Dion (6934667366).jpg|thumb|In pre-literate society, the distinctive shape of amphorae was used to provide consumers with information about goods and quality. Pictured: Amphorae for wine and oil, Archaeological Museum, Dion]] 
Branding and labelling have a very ancient history. Branding probably began with the practice of branding livestock in order to deter theft. Images of branding oxen and cattle have been found in ancient Egyptian tombs, dating to around 2,700 BCE.<ref>Khan, S.U. and Mufti, O., "The Hot History and Cold Future of Brands," ''Journal of Managerial Sciences,'' Vol. 1, No. 1, 2007, p. 76</ref> Branding was adapted to other types of goods. Identity marks, such as stamps on ceramics, were also used in ancient Egypt.<ref>Starcevic, S., "The Origin and Historical Development of Branding and Advertising in the Old Civilizations of Africa, Asia and Europe," ''Marketing,'' Vol. 46, No, 3, 2015, pp 29-46</ref>

Diana Twede has argued that the "consumer packaging functions of protection, utility and communication have been necessary whenever packages were the object of transactions" (p.&nbsp;107). She has shown that amphoras used in Mediterranean trade between 1500 and 500 BCE exhibited a wide variety of shapes and markings, which consumers used to glean information about the type of goods and the quality. Systematic use of stamped labels dates from around the fourth century BCE. In a largely pre-literate society, the shape of the amphora and its pictorial markings conveyed information about the contents, region of origin and even the identity of the producer which were understood to convey information about product quality.<ref>Twede, D., "Commercial amphoras: The earliest consumer packages?" ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 22, No. 1, 2002, pp 98–108</ref> David Wengrow has argued that branding became necessary following the urban revolution in ancient Mesopotamia in the 4th century BCE, when large-scale economies started mass-producing commodities such as alcoholic drinks, cosmetics and textiles. These ancient societies imposed strict forms of quality control over commodities, and also needed to convey value to the consumer through branding. Producers began by attaching simple stone seals to products which, over time, were transformed into clay seals bearing impressed images, often associated with the producer's personal identity thus giving the product a personality.<ref>Wengrow, D., "Prehistories of Commodity Branding," ''Current Anthropology,''Vol. 49, No. 1, 2008, pp. 7-34</ref>  Not all historians agree that these markings are comparable with modern brands or labels, with some suggesting that the early pictorial brands or simple thumbprints used in pottery should be termed ''proto-brands.'' <ref>Moore, K. and Reid., S., "The Birth of the Brand: 4000 Years of Branding," ''Business History,'' Vol. 50, 2008. p. 5; 23</ref>

Numerous scholarly studies have found evidence of branding, packaging and labelling in antiquity.<ref>Maran, J. and Stockhammer, P.W. (eds), ''Materiality and Social Practice: Transformative Capacities of Intercultural Encounters,'' Oxford, UK, Oxbow, 2012</ref><ref>Demirdjian, Z.

Archaeological evidence of potters' stamps has been found across the breadth of the Roman Empire and in ancient Greece. Stamps were used on bricks, pottery, storage containers as well as fine ceramics.<ref>Peacock, D.C.S., "Pottery in the Roman World: An Ethnoarchaeological Approach,'' Longman, 1982, p. 121-25</ref> Pottery marking was commonplace in ancient Greece by the 6th century BCE. A vase created in around 490 BCE bears the inscription “[[Sophilos]] painted me” indicating that the object was both fabricated and painted by a single potter.<ref>Starčević, S., "The Origin and Historical Development of Branding and Advertising in the Old Civilizations of Africa, Asia and Europe, ''Marketing,'' Vol. 46, No. 3, p.187</ref> Branding may have been necessary to support the extensive trade in such pots. For example, 3rd century Gaulish pots, bearing the names of well-known potters and the place of manufacture such as Attianus of Lezoux, Tetturo of Lezoux and Cinnamus of Vichy, have been found as far away as Essex in England.<ref>Fox, A. ''Roman Exeter (Isca Dumnoniorum): Excavations in the War-damaged Areas, 1945-1947,''Manchester University Press, 1952, p.70; Hartley, B.R., "Gaulish Potters' Stamps," ''The Antiquaries Journal,'' Vol. 46, No. 1, 1966, pp. 102-103, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003581500062922</ref> The use of [[hallmark]]s, a type of brand, on precious metals dates to around the 4th century CE. A series of five marks has been found on [[Byzantine]] silver dating from this period.<ref>Benson, P.L and Gilmore, R.S., "Non-Destructive Imaging of Worn-off Hallmarks and Engravings from Metal Objects of Art Using Scanning Acoustic Microscopy," https://www.ncptt.nps.gov/blog/non-destructive-imaging-of-worn-off-hallmarks-and-engravings-from-metal-objects-of-art-using-acoustic-microscopy-2004-06/, LA, [[National Center for Preservation Technology and Training]] [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]], 2004</ref>

Starčević has argued that some form of branding or proto-branding emerged spontaneously and independently throughout Africa, Asia and Europe at different times, depending on local conditions. Seals, which acted as quasi-brands, have been found on early Chinese products of the Qin Dynasty(221-206 BCE); large numbers of seals from the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappan]] civilization of the Indus Valley  (3300–1300 BCE) where the local community depended heavily on trade; cylinder seals were introduced in Ur, Mesopotamia in around 3,000 BCE and facilitated the labelling of goods and property; and the use of maker's marks on pottery was commonplace in both ancient Greece and Rome <ref>Starčević, S., "The Origin and Historical Development of Branding and Advertising in the Old Civilizations of Africa, Asia and Europe, ''Marketing,'' Vol. 46, No. 3, pp 181-197</ref> Some of the earliest use of maker's marks, dating to about 1300 BCE, have been found in India.<ref>Khan, S.U. and Mufti, O., "The Hot History and Cold Future of Brands," ''Journal of Managerial Sciences,'' Vol. 1, No. 1, 2007, pp 76-77</ref> The oldest generic brand, in continuous use in India since the [[Vedic period]] (ca. 1100 BCE to 500 BCE), is the herbal paste known as ''[[Chyawanprash]]'', consumed for its purported health benefits and attributed to a revered ''[[rishi]]'' (or seer) named Chyawan.<ref>Sanskrit Epic Mahabharat, Van Parva, p. 3000, Shalok 15–22</ref> This product was developed at [[Dhosi Hill]], an extinct volcano in northern India.

In ancient Rome, a commercial brand or inscription applied to objects offered for sale, was known as a [[titulus pictus]]. The inscription typically specified information such as place of origin, destination, type of product and occasionally quality claims or the name of the manufacturer.<ref>Latin Words and Phrase, http://www.2qk.net/latin-words-and-phrases.html</ref> Roman marks or inscriptions were applied to a very wide variety of goods including, pots, ceramics, amphorae (storage/ shipping containers)<ref>Moore, K. and Reid, S., ''The Birth of Brand: 4000 Years of Branding," ''Business History,'' Vol. 50, No. 4, pp 419-432</ref> and on factory-produced oil lamps.<ref>"New brand discovery in Modena Ancient Roman Oil Lamp 'Factory Town' Found," 2008, http://www.archeobologna.beniculturali.it/modena/viale_reiter_fornace/factory_08_en.htm</ref> Carbonized loaves of bread, found at Herculaneum, indicate that some bakers stamped their bread with the producer's name.<ref>Beard, M., ''The Fires of Vesuvius: Pompeii Lost and Found,'' Harvard University Press, 2008; See Chapter 5, "Earning a Living: Baker, Banker and Garum Maker,"</ref> [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] glassmakers branded their works, with [[Ennion]] being the most prominent.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Ken|title=Review: ‘Ennion,’ at the Met, Profiles an Ancient Glassmaker|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/06/arts/design/review-ennion-at-the-met-profiles-an-ancient-glassmaker.html|accessdate=26 March 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=5 March 2015}}</ref>

[[File:Garum Mosaik Pompeji.JPG|thumb|left|Mosaic showing garum container, from the house of Umbricius Scaurus of Pompeii. The inscription which reads "G(ari) F(los) SCO(mbri) SCAURI EX OFFI(CI)NA SCAURI" has been translated as "The flower of garum, made of the mackerel, a product of Scaurus, from the shop of Scaurus"]]

One merchant who made good use of the [[titulus pictus]] was Umbricius Scauras, a manufacturer of fish sauce (also known as [[garum]]) in Pompeii, circa 35 CE. Mosaic patterns in the atrium of his house were decorated with images of [[amphora]]e bearing his personal brand and quality claims. The mosaic comprises four different amphora, one at each corner of the atrium, and bearing labels as follows:<ref>Clarke, J. R. in Dobbins, J. J. and Foss, P.

Scauras' fish sauce was known to be of very high quality across the Mediterranean and its reputation travelled as far away as modern France.<ref>Curtis, R.I., "A Personalized Floor Mosaic from Pompeii," ''American Journal of Archaeology,'' Vol. 88, No. 4 (Oct., 1984), DOI: 10.2307/504744, pp. 557-566, Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/504744</ref> In both Pompeii and nearby Herculaneum, archaeological evidence also points to evidence of branding and labelling in relatively common use across a broad range of goods. Wine jars, for example, were stamped with names, such as  "Lassius" and "L. Eumachius;" probably references to the name of the producer.

The use of identity marks on products declined following the fall of the Roman Empire. However, in the Middle Ages with the rise of the [[merchant]]'s [[guild]]s, the use of marks resurfaced and was associated with specific types of goods. The Italians used brands in the form of [[watermark]]s on paper in the 13th century.<ref>{{cite news|last=Colapinto|first=John|title=Famous Names |url= http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/10/03/111003fa_fact_colapinto |accessdate=9 October 2011|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=3 October 2011}}</ref> [[Blind Stamp]]s, [[hallmark]]s, and silver-makers' marks, all types of brand, became widely used across Europe during the Medieval period. Hallmarks, although known from the 4th century, only fell into general use during the Medieval period.<ref>Dodd, E.C. ''Byzantine Silver Stamps,'' [Dumbarton Oaks Studies] Vol. 7, Washington, Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, 1961, pp 23–35</ref>

The widespread use of modern brands is associated with 19th century mass-marketing originating and the advent of packaged [[Good (economics)|goods]].<ref>Khan, S.U. and Mufti, O., "The Hot History and Cold Future of Brands," ''Journal of Managerial Sciences,'' Vol. 1, No. 1, 2007, p. 78</ref> [[Industrialisation|Industrialization]] moved the production of many household items, such as [[soap]], from local communities to centralized [[factory|factories]]. When shipping their items, the factories would literally [[wood branding|brand]] their [[logo]] or [[insignia]] on the barrels used, extending the meaning of ''brand'' to that of a trademark.<ref>Schwarzkopf, S., "Turning Trade Marks into Brands: how Advertising Agencies Created Brands in the Global Market Place, 1900–1930" CGR Working Paper, Queen Mary University, London, 18 August 2008</ref> Factories established during the [[Industrial Revolution]] introduced mass-produced goods and needed to sell their products to a wider market - to customers previously familiar only with locally produced goods. It quickly became apparent that a generic package of soap had difficulty competing with familiar, local products. The packaged-goods manufacturers needed to convince the market that the public could place just as much trust in the non-local product. [[Pears (soap)|Pears soap]], [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell's soup]], soft drink [[Coca-Cola]], [[Juicy Fruit|Juicy Fruit chewing gum]], [[Aunt Jemima]] pancake mix, and [[Quaker Oats Company|Quaker Oats]] oatmeal were among the first products to be "branded" in an effort to increase the consumer's familiarity with their merits. Other brands which date from that era, such as [[Uncle Ben's]] rice and [[Kellogg's]] breakfast cereal, furnish illustrations of the trend.

Some brands still in existence date from the 17th, 18th  and 19th centuries' period of mass production. [[Bass Brewery|Bass & Company]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[brewery]], claims their red-triangle brand as the world's first trademark. [[Tate & Lyle]] of Lyle's [[Golden syrup|Golden Syrup]] makes a similar claim, having been recognized by Guinness World Records<ref>{{cite news|last=Hibbert|first=Colette|title=Golden celebration for 'oldest brand'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/7180268.stm|publisher=BBC News UK|date=2008-01-10}}</ref> as Britain's oldest brand, with its green-and-gold packaging having remained almost unchanged since 1885. Another example comes from Antiche Fornaci Giorgi in [[Italy]], which has stamped or carved its bricks (as found in [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's Basilica]] in the [[Vatican City]]) with the same proto-logo since 1731.

[[File:Pears' Soap advertisement 1886.jpg|thumb|left|Pears carved a distinct brand identity and packaging in the 19th century. Pictured: APears' Soap advertisement, 1886]]

Around 1900, [[James Walter Thompson]] published a house advertisement explaining [[trademark]] advertising. This was an early commercial explanation of what we now know as branding. Companies soon adopted [[slogan]]s, [[mascot]]s, and [[jingle]]s that began to appear on [[radio]] and early [[television]]. By the 1940s,<ref>Mildred Pierce, [http://newmediagroup.co.uk/pphistory1.htm Newmediagroup.co.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206032132/http://newmediagroup.co.uk/pphistory1.htm |date=December 6, 2006 }}</ref> manufacturers began to recognize the way in which consumers were developing relationships with their brands in a social/psychological/anthropological sense.

Manufacturers quickly learned to build their brands' [[brand identity|identity]] and [[personality]] such as youthfulness, fun or luxury. This began the modern practice now known as ''branding'', where the consumers buy ''the brand'' instead of the product. This trend continued to the 1980s, and is now quantified in concepts such as [[value (ethics)|brand value]] and [[brand equity]]. Naomi Klein has described this development as "brand equity mania".<ref name="nologo" /> In 1988, for example, [[Altria Group|Philip Morris]] purchased [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]] for six times what the company was worth on paper. Business analysts have reported that what they really purchased was its brand name.

April 2, 1993, or [[Marlboro Friday]], is often considered the death of the brand<ref name="nologo" /> – the day [[Altria Group|Philip Morris]] declared that they were cutting the price of [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro cigarettes]] by 20% in order to compete with bargain [[cigarette]]s. Marlboro cigarettes were noted{{by whom|date=October 2013}} at the time for their heavy [[advertising]] campaigns and well-nuanced brand image. In response to the announcement, [[Wall Street]] stocks nose-dived<ref name="nologo" /> for a large number of branded companies: [[Heinz]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Quaker Oats Company|Quaker Oats]], [[PepsiCo]], [[Tide (brand)|Tide]], and [[Lysol]]. Many thought the event signalled the beginning of a trend towards "brand blindness" (Klein 13), questioning the power of "brand value".

==Concepts==
Effective branding can result in higher sales of not only one product, but of other products associated with that brand.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} If a customer loves Pillsbury biscuits and trusts the brand, he or she is more likely to try other products offered by the company - such as chocolate-chip cookies, for example. Brand development, often the task of a [[design]] [[team]], takes time to produce. Brand is the [[personality]] ''that identifies'' a product, service or company (name, term, sign, symbol, or design, or combination of them) and how it relates to key constituencies: customers, staff, partners, investors, etc.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Some people{{who|date=September 2014}} distinguish the psychological aspect (brand associations like thoughts, feelings, perceptions, images, experiences, beliefs, attitudes, and so on that become linked to the brand) of a brand from the experiential aspect. The experiential aspect consists of the sum of all points of contact with the brand and is known{{by whom|date=September 2014}} as the ''[[brand experience]]''. The brand experience is a brand's action perceived by a person.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The psychological aspect, sometimes referred to as the ''brand image'', is a symbolic construct created within the minds of people, consisting of all the information and expectations associated with a product, with a service, or with the companyies providing them.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

People engaged in branding seek to develop or align the expectations behind the brand experience, creating the impression that a brand associated with a product or service has certain qualities or characteristics that make it special or unique.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} A brand can therefore become one of the most valuable elements in an [[advertising theme]], as it demonstrates what the brand owner is able to offer in the [[market (place)|marketplace]].{{clarify|date=August 2016}} The art of creating and maintaining a brand is called [[brand management]]. Orientation of an entire organization towards its brand is called [[brand orientation]]. Brand orientation develops in response to [[market intelligence]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Careful brand management seeks to make products or services relevant to a [[target audience]]. Brands should be seen{{by whom|date=August 2016}} as more than the difference between the actual cost of a product and its selling price – they represent the sum of all valuable qualities of a product to the consumer.

A widely known brand is said{{by whom|date=August 2016}} to have "[[brand recognition]]". When brand recognition builds up to a point where a brand enjoys a critical mass of positive sentiment in the marketplace, it is said to have achieved [[brand franchise]]. Brand recognition is most successful when people can state a brand without being explicitly exposed to the company's name, but rather through visual signifiers like logos, slogans, and colors.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brand-recognition.asp#axzz1ZU3vlT4j |title = Brand Recognition Definition |publisher = Investopedia |date= 2013-04-19 |accessdate = 2013-04-29}}</ref> For example, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] successfully branded its particular script font (originally created for Walt Disney's "signature" logo), which it used in the logo for [[go.com]].

Consumers may look on branding as an aspect of products or services,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} as it often serves to denote a certain attractive quality or characteristic (see also [[#Brand promise|brand promise]]). From the perspective of brand owners, branded products or services can command higher prices. Where two products resemble each other, but one of the products has no associated branding (such as a [[generic brand|generic]], store-branded product), potential purchasers may often select the more expensive branded product on the basis of the perceived quality of the brand or on the basis of the reputation of the brand owner.

===Corporate brand identity===
Brand identity is the embodiment behind a corporation's reason for existence.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Simply, the brand identity is a set of individual components, such as a name, a design, a set of imagery, a slogan, a vision, etc. which set the brand aside from others.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|title= Principles of marketing|last= Kotler,|first= Philip|publisher= Pearson Education Australia|year= 2009|isbn= 9781442500419|location= |pages= }}</ref><ref>

However, that expansion of the meaning of brand identity causes some confusion because it overlaps with other common branding terms, such as brand image, brand personality, and brand meaning. [...] ''Brand identity'' and ''brand image'' are only two of the buzz words that are used and confused by brand experts and brand managers.

In order for a company to exude a strong sense of brand identity, it must have an in-depth understanding of its target market, competitors and the surrounding business environment.<ref name=":0" /> Brand identity includes both the core identity and the extended identity.<ref name=":0" /> The core identity reflects consistent long-term associations with the brand; whereas the extended identity involves the intricate details of the brand that help generate a constant motif.<ref name=":0" />

According to Kotler et al. (2009), a brand's identity may deliver four levels of meaning:

# attributes
# benefits
# values
# personality

A brand's '''attributes''' are a set of labels with which the corporation wishes to be associated. For example, a brand may showcase its primary attribute as environmental friendliness. However, a brand's attributes alone are not enough to persuade a customer into purchasing the product.<ref name=":2" /> These attributes must be communicated through '''benefits''', which are more emotional translations. If a brand's attribute is being environmentally friendly, customers will receive the benefit of feeling that they are helping the environment by associating with the brand. Aside from attributes and benefits, a brand's identity may also involve branding to focus on representing its core set of '''values'''.<ref name=":2" /> If a company is seen to symbolise specific values, it will, in turn, attract customers who also believe in these values.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} For example, Nike's brand represents the value of a "just do it" attitude.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Thus,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} this form of brand identification attracts customers who also share this same value. Even more extensive than its perceived values is a brand's '''personality'''.<ref name=":2" /> Quite literally, one can easily describe a successful brand identity as if it were a person.<ref name=":2" /> This form of brand identity has proven to be the most advantageous in maintaining long-lasting relationships with consumers, as it gives them a sense of personal interaction with the brand <ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last= Madhavaram|first= Sreedhar|last2= Badrinarayanan|first2= Vishag|last3= McDonald|first3= Robert E.|date= 2005-12-01|title= INTEGRATED MARKETING COMMUNICATION (IMC) AND BRAND IDENTITY AS CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF BRAND EQUITY STRATEGY: A Conceptual Framework and Research Propositions|url= https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00913367.2005.10639213|journal= Journal of Advertising|volume= 34|issue= 4|pages= 69–80|doi= 10.1080/00913367.2005.10639213|issn= 0091-3367}}</ref> Collectively, all four forms of brand identification help to deliver a powerful meaning behind what a corporation hopes to accomplish, and to explain why customers should choose one brand over its competitors.<ref name=":0" />

===Brand awareness===

{{Main|Brand awareness}}
[[Brand awareness]] involves a customers' ability to recall and/or recognise brands, logos and branded advertising. Brands helps customers to understand which brands or products belong to which product or service category. Brands assist customers to understand the constellation of benefits offered by individual brands, and how a given brand within a category is differentiated from competing brands, and thus the brand helps customers understand which brand satisfies their needs. Thus, the brand offers the customer a short-cut to understanding the different product or service offerings that make up a category.

Brand awareness is a key step in the customer's purchase decision process, since some kind of awareness is a precondition to purchasing. That is, customers will not consider a brand if they are not aware of it.<ref>Tan, Donald (2010). "Success Factors In Establishing Your Brand" Franchising and Licensing Association. Retrieved from http://www.flasingapore.org/info_branding.php</ref> Brand awareness is a key component in understanding the effectiveness both of a brand's identity and of its communication methods.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|title= integrated marketing communications|last= Chitty|first= Williams|publisher= Thomson|year= 2005|isbn= 0 17 012008 2|location= |pages= }}</ref> Successful brands are those that consistently generate a high level of brand awareness, as this can often{{quantify|date=August 2016}} be the pivotal factor in securing customer transactions.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|doi= 10.1002/mar.4220090402|title= A model of brand awareness and brand attitude advertising strategies|journal= Psychology and Marketing|volume= 9|issue= 4|pages= 263|year= 1992|last1= Percy|first1= Larry|last2= Rossiter|first2= John R.}}</ref>  Various forms of brand awareness can be identified. Each form reflects a different stage in a customer's cognitive ability to address the brand in a given circumstance.<ref name=":1" />

* Most companies aim for "'''Top-of-Mind'''". [[Top-of-mind awareness]] occurs when a brand pops into a consumer's mind when asked to name brands in a product category. For example, when someone is asked to name a type of facial tissue, the common answer, "Kleenex", will represent a top-of-mind brand.
* '''Unaided awareness''' (also known as ''brand recall'' or ''spontaneous awareness'') refers to the brand or set of brands that a consumer can elicit from memory when prompted with a product category
* '''Aided awareness''' (also known as ''brand recognition'') occurs when consumers see or read a list of brands, and express familiarity with a particular brand only after they hear or see it as a type of memory aide.
* '''Strategic awareness''' occurs when a brand is not only top-of-mind to consumers, but also has distinctive qualities which consumers perceive as making it better than other brands in the particular market. The distinction(s) that set a product apart from the competition is/are also known{{by whom|date=August 2016}} as the [[Unique selling proposition|unique selling point]] or USP.

'''Brand recognition''' is the initial phase of brand awareness and validates whether or not a customer remembers being pre-exposed to the brand.<ref name=":5" /> When customers experience brand recognition, they are triggered by either a visual or verbal cue.<ref name=":1" /> For example, when looking to satisfy a category need such as toilet paper, the customer would firstly be presented with multiple brands to choose from. Once the customer is visually or verbally faced with a brand, he/she may remember being introduced to the brand before. This would be classified{{by whom|date=August 2016}} as brand recognition, as the customer can retrieve the particular memory node that referred to the brand, once given a cue.<ref name=":1" /> Often, this form of brand awareness assists customers in choosing one brand over another when faced with a low-involvement purchasing decision.<ref name=":6">{{Cite journal|last= Macdonald|first= Emma K|last2= Sharp|first2= Byron M|date= 2000-04-01|title= Brand Awareness Effects on Consumer Decision Making for a Common, Repeat Purchase Product:: A Replication|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296398000708|journal= Journal of Business Research|volume= 48|issue= 1|pages= 5–15|doi= 10.1016/S0148-2963(98)00070-8}}</ref>

Unlike brand recognition, '''brand recall''' is not triggered by a visual or verbal cue. Instead, brand recall "requires that the consumers correctly retrieve the brand from memory".<ref name=":1" /> Rather than being given a choice of multiple brands to satisfy a need, consumers are faced with a need first, and then must recall a brand from their memory to satisfy that need. This level of brand awareness is stronger than brand recognition, as the brand must be firmly cemented in the consumer's memory to enable unassisted remembrance.<ref name=":5" /> Thus, brand recall is a confirmation that previous branding [[touchpoint]]s have successfully fermented in the minds of its consumers.<ref name=":6" />

[[Marketing mix modeling|Marketing-mix modeling]] can help [[marketing leader]]s optimize how they spend marketing budgets to maximize the impact on brand awareness or on sales. Managing brands for [[Value proposition|value creation]] will often involve applying marketing-mix modeling techniques in conjunction with [[brand valuation]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Brand communication===
Although brand identity is regarded{{by whom|date=August 2016}} as the most fundamental asset to a brand's [[brand equity|equity]], the worth of a brand's identity would become obsolete without ongoing brand communication.<ref>Shirazi A, Lorestani HZ, Mazidi AK. Investigating the effects of brand identity on customer loyalty from social identity perspective. Iranian Journal of Management Studies. 2013;6(2):153-78.</ref> [[Integrated marketing communications]] (IMC) relates to how a brand transmits a clear consistent message to its [[stakeholder (disambiguation)|stakeholder]]s .<ref name=":4" /> Five key components comprise IMC:<ref name=":2" />

# advertising
# sales promotions
# direct marketing
# personal selling
# public relations

The effectiveness of a brand's communication is determined by how accurately the customer perceives the brand's intended message through its IMC. Although IMC is a broad strategic concept, the most crucial brand communication elements are pinpointed{{by whom|date=August 2016}} to how the brand sends a message and what touch points the brand uses to connect with its customers.<ref name=":4" />

One can analyse the traditional communication model into several consecutive steps:<ref name=":2" />

* Firstly, a source/sender wishes to convey a message to a receiver. This source must encode the intended message in a way that the receiver will potentially understand.<ref name=":4" /> 
* After the encoding stage, the forming of the message is complete and is portrayed through a selected channel.<ref name=":7">{{Cite book|title= Advertising and promotion: an integrated marketing communications perspective|last= Belch|first= G .E|publisher= McGrawHill Irwin|year= 2012|isbn= |location= New York, NY United States of America|pages= }}</ref> In IMC, channels may include media elements such as advertising, public relations, sales promotions, etc.<ref name=":4" />
* It is at this point where the message can often deter from its original purpose as the message must go through the process of being decoded, which can often lead to unintended misinterpretation.<ref name=":7" />
* Finally, the receiver retrieves the message and attempts to understand what the sender was aiming to render. Often, a message may be incorrectly received due to noise in the market, which is caused by "…unplanned static or distortion during the communication process".<ref name=":2" />
* The final stage of this process is when the receiver responds to the message, which is received by the original sender as feedback.<ref name=":3"/>

When a brand communicates a brand identity to a receiver, it runs the risk of the receiver incorrectly interpreting the message. Therefore, a brand should use appropriate communication channels to positively "…affect how the psychological and physical aspects of a brand are perceived" <ref name=":8">Dahlen M, Lange F, Smith T. Marketing communications: A brand narrative approach. West Sussex, UK: John Wiley & Sons; 2010.</ref>

In order for brands to effectively communicate to customers, marketers must "…consider all [[touchpoint|touch point]]s, or sources of contact, that a customer has with the brand".<ref name=":9">Shimp TA. Integrated marketing communications in advertising and promotion. 8 ed. Mason, OH United States of America: South Western, Cengage Learning; 2009.</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2016}} Touch points represent the channel stage in the traditional communication model, where a message travels from the sender to the receiver. Any point where a customer has an interaction with the brand - whether watching a television advertisement, hearing about a brand through word of mouth, or even noticing a branded license plate - defines a touch point. According to Dalen ''et al.'' (2010), every touch point has the "…potential to add positive - or suppress negative - associations to the brand's equity" <ref name=":8" /> Thus a brand's IMC should cohesively deliver positive messages through appropriate touch points associated with its target market. One methodology involves using sensory stimuli touch points to activate customer emotion.<ref name=":9" /> For example, if a brand consistently uses a pleasant smell as a primary touch point, the brand has a much higher chance of creating a positive lasting effect on its customers' senses as well as memory.<ref name=":3" />  Another way a brand can ensure that it is utilising the best communication channel, is by focusing on touch points that suit particular areas associated with [[customer experience]].<ref name=":2" /> As suggested Figure 2, certain touch points link with a specific stage in customer-brand-involvement. For example, a brand may recognise that advertising touch points are most effective during the pre-purchase experience stage therefore they may target their advertisements to new customers rather than to existing customers. Overall, a brand has the ability to strengthen brand equity by using IMC branding communications through touch points.<ref name=":9" />

Brand communication is important in ensuring brand success in the [[business sector|business world]] and refers to how  businesses transmit their brand messages, characteristics and attributes to their [[consumer]]s.<ref>Uzunolu, E. and Kip, S.M., 2014. Brand communication through digital influencers: Leveraging blogger engagement. International Journal of Information Management, [online] 34(5), pp.592–602. Available at: <http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0268401214000450> [Accessed 21 Feb. 2015]</ref> One method of brand communication which companies can exploit involves [[electronic word-of mouth]] (eWOM). EWoM is a relatively new{{when|date=August 2016}} approach identified{{by whom|date=August 2016}} to communicate with consumers. One popular method of eWOM involves [[Social networking service|social networking sites]] (SNSs) such as [[Twitter]].<ref>Kim, E., Sung, Y. and Kang, H., 2014. Brand followers' retweeting behavior on Twitter: How brand relationships influence brand electronic word-of-mouth. Computers in Human Behavior, 37, pp.18–25</ref> A study found that consumers classed their relationship with a brand as closer if that brand was active on a specific social media site (Twitter). Research further found that the more consumers "retweeted" and communicated with a brand, the more they trusted the brand. This suggests that a company could look to employ a [[social-media marketing|social-media campaign]] to gain consumer trust and loyalty as well as in the pursuit of communicating brand messages.

McKee (2014) also looked into brand communication and states that when communicating a brand, a company should look to simplify its message as this will lead to more value being portrayed as well as an increased chance of target consumers recalling and recognising the brand.<ref>.McKee, S., 2014. Branding Made Simple. [online] Bloomberg Business. Available at: <https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-10-13/branding-made-simple> [Accessed 6 Feb. 2015]</ref>

In 2012 Riefler stated that if the company communicating a brand is a global organisation or has future global aims, that company should look to employ a method of communication which is globally appealing to their consumers, and subsequently choose a method of communication with will be internationally understood.<ref name="Riefler, P. 2012. pp.25">Riefler, P., 2012. Why consumers do (not) like global brands: The role of globalization attitude, GCO and global brand origin. International Journal of Research in Marketing, 29(1), pp.25–34</ref> One way a company can do this involves choosing a product or service's brand name, as this name will need to be suitable for the marketplace that it aims to enter.<ref>Sappington, D.E.M. and Wernerfelt, B., 1985. To Brand or Not to Brand? A Theoretical and Empirical Question. The Journal of Business, [online] 58(3), p.279. Available at: <http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/296297> [Accessed 17 Apr. 2015]</ref>

It is important that if a company wishes to develop a global market, the company name will also need to be suitable in different cultures and not cause offense or be misunderstood.<ref>Anon., 2009. Idea Branding. [online] ''The Economist''. Available at: <http://www.economist.com/node/14126533> [Accessed 1 Feb. 2015]</ref> It has also been found{{by whom|date=August 2016}} that when communicating a brand a company needs to be aware that they must not just visually communicate their brand message and should take advantage of portraying their message through multi-sensory information.<ref>Schmitt, B., 2012. The consumer psychology of brands. Journal of Consumer Psychology, [online] 22(1), pp.7–17. Available at: <http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1057740811001008> [Accessed 1 Feb. 2015]</ref> One article suggests that other senses, apart from vision, need to be targeted when trying to communicate a brand with consumers.<ref>
Anon., 2007. Sensory branding Sound effects. [online] The Economist. Available at: <http://www.economist.com/node/9079881> [Accessed 5 Feb. 2015]</ref>
For example, a jingle or background music can have a positive effect on brand recognition, purchasing behaviour and brand recall.

Therefore, when looking to communicate a brand with chosen consumers, companies should investigate a channel of communication which is most suitable for their short-term and long-term aims and should choose a method of communication which is most likely to be adhered to{{clarify|date=August 2016}} by their chosen consumers.<ref name="Riefler, P. 2012. pp.25"/> The match-up between the product, the [[consumer lifestyle]], and the endorser is important for effectiveness of brand communication.

==Global brand variables==

===Brand name===
[[File:Relationships trade marks – brand.svg|thumb|Relationship between trade marks and brand]]
The term "brand name" is quite often{{quantify|date=November 2015}} used{{by whom|date=November 2015}} interchangeably with "brand", although it is more correctly used to specifically denote written or spoken linguistic elements of any product. In this context a "brand name" constitutes a type of [[trademark]], if the brand name exclusively identifies the brand owner as the commercial source of products or services. A brand owner may seek to protect [[Intellectual property|proprietary rights]] in relation to a brand name through trademark registration - such trademarks are called{{by whom|date=November 2015}} "Registered Trademarks". Advertising spokespersons have also become part of some brands, for example: [[Mr. Whipple]] of [[Charmin]] toilet tissue and [[Tony the Tiger]] of [[Frosted Flakes|Kellogg's Frosted Flakes]]. Putting a value on a brand by [[brand valuation]] or using [[marketing mix modeling]] techniques is distinct to valuing a [[trademark]].

====Types of brand names====
Brand names come in many styles.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://merriamassociates.com/2009/02/styles-and-types-of-company-and-product-names/ |title= MerriamAssociates.com |publisher= MerriamAssociates.com |date= 2012-11-15 |accessdate= 2013-04-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822050819/http://merriamassociates.com/2009/02/styles-and-types-of-company-and-product-names/|archivedate= 2009-08-22}}</ref>
A few include:
* '''initialism''': a name made of initials, such as "UPS" or "IBM"
* '''descriptive''': names that describe a product benefit or function, such as "Whole Foods" or "Toys R' Us"
* '''alliteration and rhyme''': names that are fun to say and which stick in the mind, such as "Reese's Pieces" or "Dunkin' Donuts"
* '''evocative''': names that can evoke a vivid image, such as "Amazon" or "Crest"
* '''neologisms''': completely made-up words, such as "Wii" or "Häagen-Dazs"
* '''foreign word''': adoption of a word from another language, such as "Volvo" or "Samsung"
* '''founders' names''': using the names of real people, (especially a founder's name), such as "Hewlett-Packard", "Dell", "Disney", "Stussy" or "Mars"
* '''geography''': naming for regions and landmarks, such as "[[Cisco Systems|Cisco]]" or "[[Fujifilm|Fuji Film]]"
* '''personification''': taking names from myths, such as [[Nike, Inc.|"Nike"]]; or from the minds of ad execs, such as "[[Betty Crocker]]"
* '''punny''': some brands create their name by using a silly pun, such as "[[Lord of the Flies|Lord of the Fries]]", "Wok on Water" or "Eggs Eggscetera"
* '''combination''': combining multiple words together to create one, such as "Microsoft" ("microcomputer" and "software"), "Comcast" ("communications" and "broadcast"), "Evernote" ("forever" and "note"), "Vodafone" ("voice", "data", "telephone")

The act of associating a product or service with a brand has become part of [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. Most products have some kind of brand identity, from common [[Salt|table salt]] to [[Designer clothing|designer jeans]]. A [[Generic trademark|brandnomer]] is a brand name that has [[Colloquialism|colloquial]]ly become a generic term for a product or service, such as [[Band-Aid]], [[Nylon]], or [[Kleenex]]—which are often used to describe any brand of adhesive bandage; any type of hosiery; or any brand of facial tissue respectively. [[Xerox]], for example, has become [[synonym]]ous with the word "copy".

===Brand line===
A brand line allows the introduction of various subtypes of a product under a common, ideally already established, brand name. Examples would be the individual [[Kinder Chocolate]]s by Ferrero SA, the subtypes of [[Coca-Cola]], or [[special edition]]s of popular brands. See also [[#Brand extension and brand dilution|brand extension]].

===Brand identification===
[[Open Knowledge International|Open Knowledge Foundation]] created in December 2013 the [[BSIN]] (Brand Standard Identification Number). [[BSIN]] is universal and is used by the Open Product Data Working Group <ref>http://product.okfn.org</ref> of the [[Open Knowledge International|Open Knowledge Foundation]] to assign a brand to a product. The OKFN Brand repository is critical for the Open Data movement.

===Brand identity===
The outward expression of a brand – including its name, trademark, communications, and visual appearance – is brand identity.<ref name="Dictionary of Brand">Neumeier, Marty (2004), ''The Dictionary of Brand''. {{ISBN|1-884081-06-1}}, pp.20</ref> Because the identity is assembled by the brand owner, it reflects how the owner ''wants'' the consumer to perceive the brand – and by extension the branded company, organization, product or service. This is in contrast to the brand image, which is a customer's mental picture of a brand.<ref name="Dictionary of Brand" /> The brand owner will seek to bridge the gap between the brand image and the brand identity. Brand identity is fundamental to consumer recognition and symbolizes the brand's differentiation from competitors.

Brand identity is what the owner wants to communicate to its potential consumers. However, over time, a product's brand identity may acquire (evolve), gaining new attributes from consumer perspective but not necessarily from the marketing communications an owner percolates to targeted consumers. Therefore, businesses research consumer's brand associations.

====Visual brand identity====
[[File:Mobil manuals.png|thumb|The visual brand identity manual for [[Mobil|Mobil Oil]] (developed by [[Chermayeff & Geismar & Haviv]]), one of the first visual identities to integrate logotype, icon, alphabet, color palette, and station architecture.]]

A brand can also be used to attract customers by a company, if the brand of a company is well established and has goodwill. The recognition and perception of a brand is highly influenced by its visual presentation. A brand's visual identity is the overall look of its communications. Effective visual brand identity is achieved by the consistent use of particular visual elements to create distinction, such as specific fonts, colors, and graphic elements. At the core of every brand identity is a brand mark, or [[logo]]. In the United States, brand identity and logo design naturally grew out of the Modernist movement in the 1950s and greatly drew on the principles of that movement – simplicity ([[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies van der Rohe]]'s principle of "Less is more") and geometric abstraction. These principles can be observed in the work of the pioneers of the practice of visual brand identity design, such as [Lippincott and Margulies], [[Paul Rand]], [[Chermayeff & Geismar (later Chermayeff, Geismar & Haviv)]], and [[Saul Bass]]. As part of a company's brand identity, a logo should complement the company's message strategy. An effective logo is simple, memorable, and works well in any medium including both online and offline applications.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Color is a particularly important element of visual brand identity and color mapping provides an effective way of ensuring color contributes to differentiation in a visually cluttered marketplace (O'Connor, 2011).<ref>{{cite web|last=O'Connor|first=Z|title=Logo colour and differentiation: A new application of environmental colour mapping|url=http://www.academia.edu/404544/Logo_Colour_and_Differentiation_A_New_Application_of_Environmental_Colour_Mapping._Color_Research_and_Application_36_1_55-60|work=Color Research & Application, 36 (1), pp. 55–60. Also available from Colour & Design Research}}</ref>

===Brand trust===
Brand trust is the intrinsic 'believability' that any entity evokes. In the commercial world, the intangible aspect of brand trust impacts the behavior and performance of its business stakeholders in many intriguing ways. It creates the foundation of a strong brand connect with all stakeholders, converting simple awareness to strong commitment. This, in turn, metamorphoses normal people who have an indirect or direct stake in the organization into devoted ambassadors, leading to concomitant advantages like easier acceptability of brand extensions, perception of premium, and acceptance of temporary quality deficiencies.

''[[The Brand Trust Report]]'' is a syndicated primary research that has elaborated on this metric of brand trust. It is a result of action, behavior, communication and attitude of an entity, with the most trust results emerging from its action component. Action of the entity is most important in creating trust in all those audiences who directly engage with the brand, the primary experience carrying primary audiences. However, the tools of communications play a vital role in the transferring the trust experience to audiences which have never experienced the brand, the all important secondary audience.

===Brand parity===
Brand parity is the perception of the customers that some brands are equivalent.<ref>
Paul S. Richardson, Alan S. Dick and Arun K. Jain "Extrinsic and Intrinsic Cue Effects on Perceptions of Store Brand Quality", Journal of Marketing October 1994 pp. 28-36
</ref>
This means that shoppers will purchase within a group of accepted brands rather than choosing one specific brand. When brand parity operates, quality is often not a major concern because consumers believe that only minor quality differences exist.

==Expanding role of brand==
Branding was meant to make identifying and differentiating a product easier, while also providing the benefit of letting the name sell a second rate product. Over time, brands came to embrace a performance or benefit promise, for the product, certainly, but eventually also for the company behind the brand.

Today, brand plays a much bigger role. Brands have been co-opted as powerful symbols in larger debates about economics, social issues, and politics. The power of brands to communicate a complex message quickly, with emotional impact and with the ability of brands to attract media attention makes them ideal tools in the hands of activists.<ref>{{cite web |author=Bianca |url=http://merriamassociates.com/2010/12/wikileaks-hacktivism-and-brands-as-political-symbols/ |title=Wikileaks, Hacktivism and Brands as Political Symbols « Merriam Associates, Inc.

===Company name===
Often, especially in the industrial sector, it is just the company's name which is promoted (leading to{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} one of the most powerful statements of branding: saying just before the company's downgrading. This approach has not worked as well for [[General Motors]], which recently overhauled how its corporate brand relates to the product brands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://merriamassociates.com/2010/11/general-motors-a-reorganized-brand-architecture-for-a-reorganized-company/ |title=General Motors: A Reorganized Brand Architecture for a Reorganized Company « Merriam Associates, Inc.

Decisions about company names and [[Product naming|product names]] and their relationship depends on more than a dozen strategic considerations.<ref>{{cite web|author=Nisha Roy (nisharoy) – Pearltrees |url=http://merriamassociates.com/2009/09/brand-architecture-strategic-considerations/ |title=Brand Architecture: Strategic Considerations « Merriam Associates, Inc.

In this case, a strong brand name (or company name) is made the vehicle for a range of products (for example, [[Mercedes-Benz]] or [[Black & Decker]]) or a range of subsidiary brands (such as [[Cadbury]] Dairy Milk, Cadbury Flake, or [[Cadbury Fingers]] in the UK).

Each brand has a separate name (such as [[7 Up|Seven-Up]], [[Kool-Aid]], or [[Nivea]] Sun ([[Beiersdorf]]), which may compete against other brands from the same company (for example, [[Persil]], Omo, [[Surf (detergent)|Surf]], and [[Axe (brand)|Lynx]] are all owned by [[Unilever]]).

===Challenger brands===
{{main article|Challenger brand}}
A challenger brand is a brand in an industry where it is neither the market leader or a niche brand. Challenger brands are categorised by a mindset which sees them have business ambitions beyond conventional resources and an intent to bring change to an industry.

===Multiproduct branding strategy===
Multiproduct branding strategy is when a company uses one name across all their products in a product class. When the company's trade name is used, multiproduct branding is also known as corporate branding, family branding or umbrella branding. Examples of companies that use corporate branding are [[Microsoft]], [[Samsung]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and [[Sony]] as the company's brand name is identical to their trade name.  
Other examples of multiproduct branding strategy include [[Virgin Group|Virgin]] and [[Church & Dwight]]. Virgin, a multination conglomerate uses the punk inspired, handwritten red logo with the iconic tick for all its products ranging from airlines, hot air balloons, telecommunication to healthcare. Church & Dwight, a manufacturer of household products displays the [[Arm & Hammer (brand)|Arm & Hammer]] family brand name for all its products containing baking soda as the main ingredient. Multiproduct branding strategy has many advantages. It capitalises on brand equity as consumers that have a good experience with the product will in turn pass on this positive opinion to supplementary objects in the same product class as they share the same name. Consequently, the multiproduct branding strategy makes product line extension possible.

====Product line extension====
{{main article|Product line extension}}
Product line extension is the procedure of entering a new market segment in its product class by means of using a current brand name. An example of this is the [[Campbell Soup Company]], predominately a producer of canned soups. They utilize a multiproduct branding strategy by way of soup line extensions. They have over 100 soup flavours putting forward varieties such as regular Campbell soup, condensed, chunky, fresh-brewed, organic, and soup on the go. This approach is seen as favourable as it can result in a lower promotion costs and advertising due to the same name being used on all products, therefore increasing the level of brand awareness. Although, line extension has potential negative outcomes with one being that other items in the company's line may be disadvantaged because of the sale of the extension. Line extensions work at their best when they deliver an increase in company revenue by enticing new buyers or by removing sales from competitors.

====Subbranding====
{{main article|Subbranding}}
Subbranding is used by certain multiproduct branding companies. Subbranding merges a corporate, family or umbrella brand with the introduction of a new brand in order to differentiate part of a product line from others in the whole brand system. Subbranding assists to articulate and construct offerings. It can alter a brand's identity as subbranding can modify associations of the parent brand. Examples of successful subbranding can be seen through [[Gatorade]] and [[Porsche]]. Gatorade, a manufacturer of sport-themed food and beverages effectively introduced Gatorade G2, a low-calorie line of Gatorade drinks. Likewise, Porsche, a specialised automobile manufacturer successfully markets its lower-end line, [[Porsche Boxster/Cayman|Porsche Boxster]] and higher-end line, [[Porsche Carrera]].

====Brand extension====
{{main article|Brand extension}}
Brand extension is the system of employing a current brand name to enter a different product class. Having a strong brand equity allows for brand extension. Nevertheless, brand extension has its disadvantages. There is a risk that too many uses for one brand name can oversaturate the market resulting in a blurred and weak brand for consumers. Examples of brand extension can be seen through [[Kimberly-Clark]] and [[Honda]]. Kimberly-Clark is a corporation that produces personal and health care products being able to extend the [[Huggies]] brand name across a full line of toiletries for toddlers and babies. The success of this brand extension strategy is apparent in the $500 million in annual sales generated globally. Similarly, Honda using their reputable name for automobiles has spread to other products such as motorcycles, power equipment, engines, robots, aircraft, and bikes.

====Co-branding====
{{main article|Co-branding}}
Co-branding is a variation of brand extension. It is where a single product is created from the combining of two brand names of two manufacturers. Co-branding has its advantages as it lets firms enter new product classes and exploit a recognized brand name in that product class. An example of a co-branding success is Whitaker's working with [[Lewis Road Creamery]] to create a co-branded beverage called Lewis Road Creamery and Whittaker's Chocolate Milk. This product was a huge success in the New Zealand market with it going viral.

===Multibranding strategy===
Multibranding strategy is when a company gives each product a distinct name. Multibranding is best used as an approach when each brand in intended for a different market segment. Multibranding is used in an assortment of ways with selected companies grouping their brands based on price-quality segments. [[Procter & Gamble]] (P&G), a multinational consumer goods company that offers over 100 brands, each suited for different consumer needs. For instance, [[Head & Shoulders]] that helps consumers relieve dandruff in the form of a shampoo, [[Oral-B]] which offers inter-dental products, [[Vicks]] which offers cough and cold products, and [[Downy]] which offers dryer sheets and fabric softeners. Other examples include [[Coca-Cola]], [[Nestlé]], [[Kellogg's]], and [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars]].

This approach usually results in higher promotion costs and advertising. This is due to the company being required to generate awareness among consumers and retailers for each new brand name without the benefit of any previous impressions. Multibranding strategy has many advantages. There is no risk that a product failure will affect other products in the line as each brand is unique to each market segment. Although, certain large multiband companies have come across that the cost and difficulty of implementing a multibranding strategy can overshadow the benefits. For example, [[Unilever]], the world's third-largest multination consumer goods company recently streamlined its brands from over 400 brands to centre their attention onto 14 brands with sales of over 1 billion euros. Unilever accomplished this through product deletion and sales to other companies. Other multibrand companies introduce new product brands as a protective measure to respond to competition called fighting brands or fighter brands.

====Fighting brands====
{{main article|Fighter brands}}
The main purpose of fighting brands is to challenge competitor brands. For example, [[Qantas]], Australia's largest flag carrier airline, introduced [[Jetstar Airways|Jetstar]] to go head-to-head against the low-cost carrier, [[Virgin Australia]] (formerly known as Virgin Blue). Jetstar is an Australian low-cost airline for budget conscious travellers, but it receives many negative reviews due to this. The launching of Jetstar allowed Qantas to rival Virgin Australia without the criticism being affiliated with Qantas because of the distinct brand name.

===Private branding strategy===
Private branding is also known as reseller branding, private labelling, store brands, or own brands have increased in popularity. Private branding is when a company manufactures products but it is sold under the brand name of a wholesaler or retailer. Private branding is popular because it typically produces high profits for manufacturers and resellers. The pricing of private brand product are usually cheaper compared to competing name brands. Consumers are commonly deterred by these prices as it sets a perception of lower quality and standard but these views are shifting.

In Australia, their leading supermarket chains, both [[Woolworths Supermarkets|Woolworths]] and [[Coles Supermarkets|Coles]] are saturated with store brands (or private labels). For example, in the United States, Paragon Trade Brands, [[Ralcorp|Ralcorp Holdings]], and [[Spectrum Brands|Rayovac]] are major suppliers of diapers, grocery products, and private label alkaline batteries, correspondingly. [[Costco]], [[Walmart]], [[RadioShack]], [[Sears]], and [[Kroger]] are large retailers that have their own brand names. Similarly, [[Macy's]], a mid-range chain of department stores offers a wide catalogue of private brands exclusive to their stores, from brands such as First Impressions which supply newborn and infant clothing, Hotel Collection which supply luxury linens and mattresses, and Tasso Elba which supply European inspired menswear. They use private branding strategy to specifically target consumer markets.

===Mixed branding strategy===
Mixed branding strategy is where a firm markets products under its own name(s) and that of a reseller because the segment attracted to the reseller is different from its own market. 
For example, [[Elizabeth Arden, Inc.]], a major American cosmetics and fragrance company, uses mixed branding strategy. The company sells its Elizabeth Arden brand through department stores and line of skin care products at [[Walmart]] with the "skin simple" brand name. Companies such as [[Whirlpool Corporation|Whirlpool]], [[Del Monte Foods|Del Monte]], and [[Dial (soap)|Dial]] produce private brands of home appliances, pet foods, and soap, correspondingly. Other examples of mixed branding strategy include [[Michelin]], [[Seiko Epson|Epson]], [[Microsoft]], [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]], and [[Toyota]]. Michelin, one of the largest tire manufacturers allowed [[Sears]], an American retail chain to place their brand name on the tires. Microsoft, a multinational technology company is seriously regarded as a corporate technology brand but it sells its versatile home entertainment hub under the brand Xbox to better align with the new and crazy identity. Gillette catered to females with Gillette for Women which has now become known as Venus. The launch of Venus was conducted in order to fulfil the feminine market of the previously dominating masculine razor industry. Similarly, Toyota, an automobile manufacturer used mixed branding. In the U.S., Toyota was regarded as a valuable car brand being economical, family orientated and known as a vehicle that rarely broke down. But Toyota sought out to fulfil a higher end, expensive market segment, thus they created [[Lexus]], the luxury vehicle division of premium cars.

===Attitude branding and iconic brands===
Attitude branding is the choice to represent a larger feeling, which is not necessarily connected with the product or [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of the product at all. [[Marketing]] labeled as attitude branding include that of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Starbucks]], [[The Body Shop]], [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]], and [[Apple Inc.]]. In the 2000 book ''[[No Logo]]'',<ref name="nologo">{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} [[Naomi Klein|Klein, Naomi]] (2000) ''[[No logo]]'', Canada: Random House, {{ISBN|0-676-97282-9}}</ref> [[Naomi Klein]] describes attitude branding as a "fetish strategy". Schaefer and Kuehlwein analyzed brands such as [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Ben & Jerry's]] or [[Chanel]] describing them as 'Ueber-Brands' - brands that are able to gain and retain "meaning beyond the material."<ref>Schaefer, Wolf and Kuehlwein, JP. 2015. Rethinking Prestige Branding - Secrets of the Ueber-Brands. Kogan Page. p.17. {{ISBN|9780749470036}}</ref><ref>Mathur, Sarita, Kuehlwein, JP and Schaefer, Wolf.

Asia Management Insights, Singapore Management University. vol.3 2016</ref>
<blockquote>A great brand raises the bar – it adds a greater sense of purpose to the experience, whether it's the challenge to do your best in sports and fitness, or the affirmation that the cup of coffee you're drinking really matters. – [[Howard Schultz]] (president, CEO, and chairman of [[Starbucks]])
</blockquote>

[[File:English & Hebrew Coke labels.jpg|thumb|alt=Bottles of Coca-Cola with labels printed in English and Hebrew|The color, letter font and style of the [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Diet Coke|Diet Coca-Cola]] [[logo]]s in [[English language|English]] were copied into matching [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] logos to maintain brand identity in Israel.]]

Iconic brands are defined as having aspects that contribute to consumer's self-expression and personal identity. Brands whose value to consumers comes primarily from having identity value are said to be "identity brands". Some of these brands have such a strong identity that they become more or less cultural icons which makes them "iconic brands". Examples are: [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], and [[Harley-Davidson]]. Many iconic brands include almost ritual-like behaviour in purchasing or consuming the products.

There are four key elements to creating iconic brands (Holt 2004):
# "Necessary conditions" – The performance of the product must at least be acceptable, preferably with a reputation of having good quality.
# "Myth-making" – A meaningful storytelling fabricated by cultural insiders. These must be seen as legitimate and respected by consumers for stories to be accepted.
# "Cultural contradictions" – Some kind of mismatch between prevailing ideology and emergent undercurrents in society. In other words, a difference with the way consumers are and how they wish they were.
# "The cultural brand management process" – Actively engaging in the myth-making process in making sure the brand maintains its position as an icon.

Schaefer and Kuehlwein propose the following 'Ueber-Branding' principles.  They derived them from studying successful modern Prestige brands and what elevates them above mass competitors and beyond considerations of performance and price (alone) in the minds of consumers:<ref>Schaefer, Wolf and Kuehlwein, JP. 2015.

# "Longing versus Belonging" - Playing with the opposing desires of people for Inclusion on the one hand and Exclusivity on the other.

==="No-brand" branding===
Recently, a number of companies have successfully pursued "no-brand" strategies by creating packaging that imitates [[generic brand]] simplicity. Examples include the [[Japan]]ese company [[Muji]], which means "No label" in English (from 無印良品 – "Mujirushi Ryohin" – literally, "No brand quality goods"), and the Florida company No-Ad Sunscreen. Although there is a distinct Muji brand, Muji products are not branded. This no-brand strategy means that little is spent on advertisement or classical marketing and Muji's success is attributed to the word-of-mouth, a simple shopping experience and the anti-brand movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.venturerepublic.com/resources/Muji_The_Japanese_No-Brand.asp |title=Muji brand strategy, Muji branding, no name brand |publisher=VentureRepublic |date= |accessdate=2013-04-29}}</ref><ref>Matt Heig, Brand Royalty: How the World's Top 100 Brands Thrive and Survive, pg.216</ref><ref>[https://archive.is/20130122022144/http://www.emeasee.com/no-brand-brand/ EMEASEE.com]</ref>
"No brand" branding may be construed as a type of branding as the product is made conspicuous through the absence of a brand name.
"Tapa Amarilla" or "Yellow Cap" in Venezuela during the 1980s is another good example of no-brand strategy. It was simply recognized by the color of the cap of this cleaning products company.

==={{anchor|derivative}} Derived brands<!-- Section linked from [[Horus Heresy]] [[Horus Heresy (novels)]] -->===
In this case the supplier of a key component, used by a number of suppliers of the end-product, may wish to guarantee its own position by promoting that component as a brand in its own right. The most frequently quoted example is [[Intel]], which positions itself in the [[Personal computer|PC]] market with the slogan (and sticker) "[[Intel Inside]]".

===Brand extension and brand dilution===
The existing strong brand name can be used as a vehicle for new or modified products;
for example, many [[fashion]] and designer companies extended brands into fragrances, shoes and [[Fashion accessory|accessories]], home textile, [[Interior design|home decor]], [[baggage|luggage]], (sun-) glasses, furniture, hotels, etc.

Mars extended its brand to ice cream, [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] to shoes and watches, [[Michelin]] to a restaurant guide, [[Adidas]] and [[Puma SE|Puma]] to personal hygiene. [[Dunlop (brands)|Dunlop]] extended its brand from tires to other rubber products such as shoes, golf balls, tennis racquets, and adhesives. Frequently, the product is no different from what else is on the market, except a brand name marking. Brand is product identity.

There is a difference between brand extension and [[#Brand line|line]] extension. A line extension is when a current brand name is used to enter a new market segment in the existing product class, with new varieties or flavors or sizes.
When [[Coca-Cola]] launched "Diet Coke" and "Cherry Coke", they stayed within the originating product category: non-alcoholic carbonated beverages. [[Procter & Gamble]] (P&G) did likewise extending its strong lines (such as Fairy Soap) into neighboring products (Fairy Liquid and Fairy Automatic) within the same category, dish washing detergents.

The risk of over-extension is brand dilution where the brand loses its brand associations with a market segment, product area, or quality, price or cachet.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Social media brands===
In 'The Better Mousetrap: Brand Invention in a Media Democracy' (2012), author and brand strategist Simon Pont posits that social media brands may be the most evolved version of the brand form, because they focus not on themselves but on their users. In so doing, social media brands are arguably more charismatic, in that consumers are compelled to spend time with them, because the time spent is in the meeting of fundamental human drivers related to belonging and individualism. "We wear our physical brands like badges, to help define us – but we use our digital brands to help express who we are. They allow us to be, to hold a mirror up to ourselves, and it is clear. We like what we see." <ref name= "Media Democracy">[https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Better-Mousetrap-Invention-Democracy/dp/0749466219], 'The Better Mousetrap: Brand Invention in a Media Democracy' (2013) Simon Pont. Kogan Page. {{ISBN|978-0749466213}}</ref>

===Multi-brands===
{{refimprove section|date=February 2016}}
Alternatively, in a market that is fragmented amongst a number of brands a supplier can choose deliberately to launch totally new brands in apparent competition with its own existing strong brand (and often with identical product characteristics); simply to soak up some of the share of the market which will in any case go to minor brands. The rationale is that having 3 out of 12 brands in such a market will give a greater overall share than having 1 out of 10 (even if much of the share of these new brands is taken from the existing one). In its most extreme manifestation, a supplier pioneering a new market which it believes will be particularly attractive may choose immediately to launch a second brand in competition with its first, in order to pre-empt others entering the market. This strategy is widely known as multi-brand strategy.

Individual brand names naturally allow greater flexibility by permitting a variety of different products, of differing quality, to be sold without confusing the consumer's perception of what
business the company is in or diluting higher quality products.

Once again, [[Procter & Gamble]] is a leading exponent of this philosophy, running as many as ten detergent brands in the US market. This also increases the total number of "facings" it receives on supermarket shelves. [[Sara Lee Corporation|Sara Lee]], on the other hand, uses it to keep the very different parts of the business separate—from Sara Lee cakes through Kiwi polishes to L'Eggs pantyhose. In the hotel business, [[Marriott International|Marriott]] uses the name [[Fairfield Inn by Marriott|Fairfield Inns]] for its budget chain (and [[Choice Hotels]] uses [[Rodeway Inn|Rodeway]] for its own cheaper hotels).

[[Cannibalization (marketing)|Cannibalization]] is a particular problem of a multi-brand strategy approach, in which the new brand takes business away from an established one which the organization also owns. This may be acceptable (indeed to be expected) if there is a net gain overall. Alternatively, it may be the price the organization is willing to pay for shifting its position in the market; the new product being one stage in this process.

===Private labels===
[[Private label]] brands, also called [[own brand]]s, or [[store brand]]s have become popular. Where the retailer has a particularly strong identity (such as [[Marks & Spencer]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] clothing sector) this "own brand" may be able to compete against even the strongest brand leaders, and may outperform those products that are not otherwise strongly branded.

'''Designer Private Labels'''

A relatively recent innovation in retailing is the introduction of designer private labels. Designer-private labels involve a collaborative contract between a well-known fashion designer and a retailer. Both retailer and designer collaborate to design goods with popular appeal pitched at price points that fit the consumer’s budget. For retail outlets, these types of collaborations give them greater control over the design process as well as access to exclusive store brands that can potentially drive store traffic.

In Australia, for example, the department store, Myer, now offers a range of exclusive designer private labels including Jayson Brundson, Karen Walker, Leona Edmiston, Wayne Cooper, Fleur Wood and ‘L’ for Lisa Ho.<ref>Schetzer, A., "Private Labels in Designer Sheep's Clothing, Sydney Morning Herald, 7 September 2014 Online:http://www.smh.com.au/business/private-labels-in-designer-sheeps-clothing-20140925-10ilia.html</ref> Another up-market department store, David Jones, currently offers ‘Collette’ for leading Australian designer, Collette Dinnigan, and has recently announced its intention to extend the number of exclusive designer brands.<ref>Roy Morgan Research,"Private Label Could be the New Black" Research Finding no. 5613, [Media Release] May, 2014 Online: http://roymorgan.com.au/findings/5613-private-label-could-be-new-black-201405292337</ref> Target has teamed up with Danii Minogue to produce her “Petites’ range.<ref>Roy Morgan Research, "Target On Target for New Era Women's Fashion," Research Finding, no. 5756, August, 2014 Online: http://roymorgan.com.au/findings/5756-target-on-target-for-new-era-womens-fashion-201408260520</ref> Specsavers has joined up with Sydney designer, Alex Perry to create an exclusive range of spectacle frames while Big W stocks frames designed by Peter Morrissey.

===Individual and organizational brands===
With the development of brand, Branding is no longer limited to a product or service.<ref name="The Wall Street Journal">{{cite news|url=http://deloitte.wsj.com/cio/2014/12/16/is-your-personal-brand-working-for-or-against-you/?KEYWORDS=branding |title=Is Your Personal Brand Working For or Against You? |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=2014-12-16 |accessdate=2015-02-01}}</ref> There are kinds of branding that treat individuals and organizations as the products to be branded. Most [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organizations]] carry their brand as a fundraising tool. The purpose of most NGOs is leave social impact so their brand become associated with specific social life matters. [[Amnesty International]], [[Habitat for Humanity]], [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]] and [[AIESEC]] are among the most recognized brands around the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_role_of_brand_in_the_nonprofit_sector|title=The Role of Brand in the Nonprofit Sector (SSIR)|website=ssir.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-06-07}}</ref> NGOs and non-profit organizations moved beyond using their brands for fundraising to express their internal identity and to clarify their social goals and long-term aims.

===Crowd sourced branding===
These are brands that are created by "the public" for the business, which is opposite to the traditional method where the business create a brand.

===Personalised branding===

Many businesses have started to use elements of personalisation in their branding strategies, offering the client or consumer the ability to choose from various brand options or have direct control over the brand. Examples of this include the #ShareACoke campaign by [[Coca-Cola]]{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} which printed people's names and place names on their bottles encouraging people. [[AirBNB]] has created the facility for users to create their own symbol for the software to replace the brand's mark known as The Bélo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ft.com/tech-blog/2014/07/airbnb-new-logo-belo/ |title=Airbnb says its new logo belongs to everyone |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921204457/http://blogs.ft.com/tech-blog/2014/07/airbnb-new-logo-belo/ |archivedate=September 21, 2014 }}</ref>

===Nation branding (place branding and public diplomacy)===
[[Nation branding]] is a field of theory and practice which aims to measure, build and manage the reputation of countries (closely related to [[place branding]]). Some approaches applied, such as an increasing importance on the symbolic value of products, have led countries to emphasise their distinctive characteristics. The branding and image of a nation-state "and the successful transference of this image to its exports – is just as important as what they actually produce and sell."

===Destination branding===
Destination branding is the work of cities, states, and other localities to promote to themselves. This work is designed to promote the location to tourists and drive additional revenues into a tax base. These activities are often undertaken by governments, but can also result from the work of community associations. The Destination Marketing Association International is the industry leading organization.

==Doppelgänger brand image (DBI)==
A doppelgänger brand image or "DBI"  is a disparaging image or story about a brand that it circulated in popular culture. DBI targets tend to be widely known and recognizable brands. The purpose of DBIs is to undermine the positive brand meanings the brand owners are trying to instill through their marketing activities.<ref name="Thompson 50–64">{{cite journal|title=Emotional Branding and the Strategic Value of the Doppelgänger Brand Image|url=http://journals.ama.org/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.2006.70.1.50|journal=Journal of Marketing|date=2006-01-01|issn=0022-2429|pages=50–64|volume=70|issue=1|doi=10.1509/jmkg.2006.70.1.50|first=Craig J.|last=Thompson|first2=Aric|last2 = Rindfleisch|first3=Zeynep|last3=Arsel}}</ref>

The term stems from the combination of the German words ''doppel'' (double) and ''gänger'' (walker).

Doppelgänger brands are typically created by individuals or groups to express criticism of a brand and its perceived values, through a form of parody, and are typically unflattering in nature.

Due to the ability of Doppelgänger brands to rapidly propagate virally through digital media channels, they can represent a real threat to the equity of the target brand. Sometimes the target organization is forced to address the root concern or to re-position the brand in a way that defuses the criticism.

Examples include:
* '''Joe Chemo''' campaign organized to criticize the marketing of tobacco products to children and their harmful effects.<ref>{{cite web|title=Joe Chemo: A Camel Who Wishes He'd Never Smoked|url=http://www.joechemo.org/|website = www.joechemo.org|accessdate=2015-09-10}}</ref>

In the 2006 article "Emotional Branding and the Strategic Value of the Doppelgänger Brand Image", Thompson, Rindfleisch, and Arsel suggest that a doppelgänger brand image can be a benefit to a brand if taken as an early warning sign that the brand is losing emotional authenticity with its market.<ref name="Thompson 50–64"/>
