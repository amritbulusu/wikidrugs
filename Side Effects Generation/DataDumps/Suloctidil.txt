'''Suloctidil''' was a sulfer-containing [[aminoalcohol]] that was brought to market in the early 1970s as a [[vasodilator]] by Continental Pharma, a Belgian company.<ref>Josef Hladovec.

Continental was bought by [[Monsanto]] in 1984, primarily on the promise of sales of suloctidil, which was approved in Europe at the time, but not in the US.<ref>Staff, The Pink Sheet.
