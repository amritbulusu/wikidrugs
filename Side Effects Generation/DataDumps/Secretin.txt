'''Secretin''' is a [[hormone]] that regulates [[Osmoregulation|water homeostasis]] throughout the body and influences the environment of the [[duodenum]] by regulating secretions in the [[stomach]], [[pancreas]], and [[liver]]. It is a [[peptide hormone]] produced in the [[S cell]]s of the duodenum, which are located in the [[intestinal gland]]s.<ref name="pmid7000396">{{cite journal |vauthors=Häcki WH |title=Secretin |journal=Clinics in Gastroenterology |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=609–32 |year=1980 |pmid=7000396 }}</ref> In humans, the secretin peptide is encoded by the SCT [[gene]].<ref name="pmid2315322">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kopin AS, Wheeler MB, Leiter AB |title=Secretin: structure of the precursor and tissue distribution of the mRNA |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=87 |issue=6 |pages=2299–303 |year=1990 |pmid=2315322 |pmc=53674 |jstor=2354038 |bibcode=1990PNAS...87.2299K |doi=10.1073/pnas.87.6.2299 }}</ref>

Secretin helps regulate the [[pH]] of the duodenum by (1) inhibiting the secretion of [[gastric acid]] from the [[parietal cells]] of the stomach and (2) stimulating the production of [[bicarbonate]] from the [[centroacinar cell]]s and intercalated ducts of the pancreas.<ref name="pmid11060443">{{cite journal |vauthors=Whitmore TE, Holloway JL, Lofton-Day CE, Maurer MF, Chen L, Quinton TJ, Vincent JB, Scherer SW, Lok S |title=Human secretin (SCT): gene structure, chromosome location, and distribution of mRNA |journal=Cytogenetics and Cell Genetics |volume=90 |issue=1–2 |pages=47–52 |year=2000 |pmid=11060443 |doi=10.1159/000015658 }}</ref> It also stimulates [[bile]] production by the liver; the bile emulsifies dietary fats in the duodenum so that [[pancreatic lipase]] can act upon them. Meanwhile, in concert with secretin's actions, the other main hormone simultaneously issued by the duodenum, [[cholecystokinin]], is stimulating the [[gallbladder]] to contract, delivering its stored bile for the same reason.

'''Prosecretin''' is a precursor to secretin, which is present in digestion. Secretin is stored in this unusable form, and is activated by [[gastric acid]] in the lower intestine to neutralize the pH and ensure no damage is done to the small intestine by the aforementioned acid.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gafvelin G, Jörnvall H, Mutt V | title = Processing of prosecretin: isolation of a secretin precursor from porcine intestine | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 87 | issue = 17 | pages = 6781–5 | date = Sep 1990 | pmid = 2395872 | pmc = 54621 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.87.17.6781 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/87/17/6781.full.pdf }}</ref>

==Discovery ==
Secretin was the first hormone to be identified.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Henriksen JH, Schaffalitzky de Muckadell OB |title=Sekretin - det første hormon |trans_title=Secretin--the first hormone |language=Danish |journal=Ugeskrift for Laeger |volume=164 |issue=3 |pages=320–5 |year=2002 |id={{INIST|13419424}} |pmid=11816326 }}</ref> In 1902, [[William Bayliss]] and [[Ernest Starling]] were studying how the nervous system controls the process of digestion.<ref name="Bayliss_1902">{{cite journal |vauthors=Bayliss WM, Starling EH |title=The mechanism of pancreatic secretion |journal=The Journal of Physiology |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=325–53 |year=1902 |pmid=16992627 |pmc=1540572 |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1902.sp000920 }}</ref> It was known that the pancreas secreted digestive juices in response to the passage of food (chyme) through the pyloric sphincter into the duodenum. They discovered (by cutting all the nerves to the pancreas in their experimental animals) that this process was not, in fact, governed by the nervous system. They determined that a substance secreted by the intestinal lining stimulates the pancreas after being transported via the bloodstream. They named this intestinal secretion ''secretin''. Secretin was the first such "chemical messenger" identified. This type of substance is now called a [[hormone]], a term coined by Bayliss in 1905.<ref name="pmid_15308687">{{Citation |last=Hirst |first=BH |year=2004 |title=Secretin and the exposition of hormonal control |journal=J Physiol |volume=560 |pages=339 |pmid=15308687 |pmc=1665254 |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2004.073056 |postscript=.}}</ref>

==Structure==

Secretin is initially synthesized as a 120 amino acid precursor protein known as [[prosecretin]]. This precursor contains an [[N-terminus|N-terminal]] signal peptide, spacer, secretin itself (residues 28–54), and a 72-amino acid [[C-terminus|C-terminal]] peptide.<ref name="pmid2315322"/>

The mature secretin peptide is a linear [[peptide hormone]], which is composed of 27 [[amino acids]] and has a [[molecular weight]] of 3055. A helix is formed in the amino acids between positions 5 and 13. The amino acids sequences of secretin have some similarities to that of [[glucagon]], [[vasoactive intestinal peptide]] (VIP), and [[gastric inhibitory peptide]] (GIP). Fourteen of 27 amino acids of secretin reside in the same positions as in glucagon, 7 the same as in VIP, and 10 the same as in GIP.<ref name="isbn0-7216-9398-9">{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Robert L. |title=Textbook of Endocrinology |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=1981 |page=697 |isbn=0-7216-9398-9 }}</ref>

Secretin also has an amidated [[carboxyl-terminal]] amino acid which is valine.<ref name="isbn0-7216-2888-5">{{cite book |last1=DeGroot |first1=Leslie Jacob |editor1-first=J.

==Physiology==

===Production and secretion===
Secretin is synthesized in cytoplasmic secretory granules of S-cells, which are found mainly in the [[mucosa]] of the [[duodenum]], and in smaller numbers in the jejunum of the [[small intestine]].<ref name="pmid4945081">{{cite journal |vauthors=Polak JM, Coulling I, Bloom S, Pearse AG |title=Immunofluorescent localization of secretin and enteroglucagon in human intestinal mucosa |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Gastroenterology |volume=6 |issue=8 |pages=739–44 |year=1971 |pmid=4945081 |doi=10.3109/00365527109179946 }}</ref>

Secretin is released into circulation and/or intestinal lumen in response to low duodenal pH that ranges between 2 and 4.5 depending on species; the acidity is due to [[hydrochloric acid]] in the [[chyme]] that enters the duodenum from the stomach via the [[pyloric sphincter]].<ref name="isbn0-07-022001-8">{{cite book |last1=Frohman |first1=Lawrence A. |last2=Felig |first2=Philip |editor1-first=P.

Div |location=New York |year=2003 |chapter=Regulation of Gastrointestinal Function |isbn=0-07-140236-5 }}{{page needed|date=January 2016}}</ref>

Secretin release is inhibited by [[H2 antagonist|H<sub>2</sub> antagonist]]s, which reduce gastric acid secretion. As a result, if the pH in the duodenum increases above 4.5, secretin cannot be released.<ref name="pmid7249893">{{cite journal |vauthors=Rominger JM, Chey WY, Chang TM |title=Plasma secretin concentrations and gastric pH in healthy subjects and patients with digestive diseases |journal=Digestive Diseases and Sciences |volume=26 |issue=7 |pages=591–7 |year=1981 |pmid=7249893 |doi=10.1007/BF01367670 }}</ref>

===Function===
====pH regulation====
Secretin primarily functions to  neutralize the pH in the [[duodenum]], allowing digestive [[enzyme]]s from the pancreas (e.g., [[pancreatic amylase]] and [[pancreatic lipase]]) to function optimally.<ref name="isbn0-7216-0240-1"/>

Secretin targets the [[pancreas]]; pancreatic centroacinar cells have [[secretin receptors]] in their plasma membrane. As secretin binds to these receptors, it stimulates adenylate cyclase activity and converts [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to [[cyclic AMP]].<ref name="isbn">{{cite book |last1=Gardner |first1=JD |editor1-last=Sleisenger |editor1-first=MH |editor2-last=Fordtran |editor2-first=JS |title=Gastrointestinal Disease |edition=2nd |publisher=WB Saunders Company |location=Philadelphia |year=1978 |chapter=Receptors and gastrointestinal hormones |pages=179–95 }}</ref> Cyclic AMP acts as second messenger in intracellular signal transduction and causes the organ to secrete a [[bicarbonate]]-rich fluid that flows into the [[intestine]]. Bicarbonate is a base that neutralizes the acid, thus establishing a pH favorable to the action of other digestive enzymes in the small intestine.<ref name="pmid631638">{{cite journal |vauthors=Osnes M, Hanssen LE, Flaten O, Myren J |title=Exocrine pancreatic secretion and immunoreactive secretin (IRS) release after intraduodenal instillation of bile in man |journal=Gut |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=180–4 |year=1978 |pmid=631638 |pmc=1411891 |doi=10.1136/gut.19.3.180 }}</ref> 

Secretin also increases water and bicarbonate secretion from duodenal [[Brunner's gland]]s to buffer the incoming [[protons]] of the acidic chyme,<ref name="isbn0-7216-0240-1">{{cite book |last1=Hall |first1=John E. |last2=Guyton |first2=Arthur C. |title=Textbook of medical physiology |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=St. Louis, Mo |year=2006 |pages=800–1 |isbn=0-7216-0240-1 }}</ref> and also reduces acid secretion by [[parietal cells]] of the [[stomach]].<ref name="isbn0-7020-3085-6">{{cite book |editor1-last=Colledge |editor1-first=NR |editor2-last=Walker |editor2-first=BR |editor3-last=Ralston |editor3-first=SH |last1=Palmer |first1=KR |last2=Penman |first2=ID |title=Davidson's Principles and Practice of Medicine |edition=20th |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |location=Edinburgh |year=2010 |isbn=0-7020-3085-6 |chapter=Alimentary track and pancreatic disease |page=844}}</ref> It does this through at least three mechanisms: 1) By stimulating release of [[somatostatin]], 2) By inhibiting release of [[gastrin]] in the [[pyloric antrum]], and 3) By direct [[downregulation]] of the parietal cell acid secretory mechanics.<ref name="isbn9781437717532">{{cite book |last1=Boron |first1=Walter F. |last2=Boulpaep |first2=Emile L. |title=Medical Physiology |edition=2nd |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2012 |page=1352 |isbn=978-1-4377-1753-2 |chapter=Acid secretion }}</ref><ref name="isbn0-07-022001-8"/>

====Osmoregulation====

Secretin modulates [[Osmoregulation|water]] and [[electrolyte]] transport in [[pancreatic duct]] cells,<ref name="pmid7875488">{{cite journal |vauthors=Villanger O, Veel T, Raeder MG |title=Secretin causes H+/HCO3- secretion from pig pancreatic ductules by vacuolar-type H(+)-adenosine triphosphatase |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=108 |issue=3 |pages=850–9 |year=1995 |pmid=7875488 |doi=10.1016/0016-5085(95)90460-3 }}</ref> liver [[cholangiocytes]],<ref name="pmid9148905">{{cite journal |vauthors=Marinelli RA, Pham L, Agre P, LaRusso NF |title=Secretin promotes osmotic water transport in rat cholangiocytes by increasing aquaporin-1 water channels in plasma membrane.

Secretin is found in the magnocellular neurons of the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the [[hypothalamus]] and along the neurohypophysial tract to [[neurohypophysis]]. During increased osmolality, it is released from the [[posterior pituitary]]. In the hypothalamus, it activates [[vasopressin]] release.<ref name="Chu"/> It is also needed to carry out the central effects of angiotensin II. In the absence of secretin or its receptor in the gene knockout animals, central injection of angiotensin II was unable to stimulate water intake and vasopressin release.<ref name="pmid20739612">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee VH, Lee LT, Chu JY, Lam IP, Siu FK, Vaudry H, Chow BK |title=An indispensable role of secretin in mediating the osmoregulatory functions of angiotensin II |journal=FASEB Journal |volume=24 |issue=12 |pages=5024–32 |year=2010 |pmid=20739612 |pmc=2992369 |doi=10.1096/fj.10-165399 }}</ref>

It has been suggested that abnormalities in such secretin release could explain the abnormalities underlying type D [[syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion]] (SIADH).<ref name="Chu"/> In these individuals, vasopressin release and response are normal, although abnormal renal expression, translocation of [[aquaporin 2]], or both are found.<ref name="Chu"/> It has been suggested that "Secretin as a neurosecretory hormone from the posterior pituitary, therefore, could be the long-sought vasopressin independent mechanism to solve the riddle that has puzzled clinicians and physiologists for decades."<ref name="Chu"/>

====Food intake====

Secretin and its receptor are found in discrete nuclei of the hypothalamus, including the paraventricular nucleus and the arcuate nucleus, which are the primary brain sites for regulating body energy homeostasis. It was found that both central and peripheral injection of Sct reduce food intake in mouse, indicating an anorectic role of the peptide. This function of the peptide is mediated by the central melanocortin system.<ref name="pmid20927047">{{cite journal |vauthors=Cheng CY, Chu JY, Chow BK |title=Central and peripheral administration of secretin inhibits food intake in mice through the activation of the melanocortin system |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=459–71 |year=2011 |pmid=20927047 |pmc=3055665 |doi=10.1038/npp.2010.178 }}</ref>

== Uses ==
Secretin is used in a diagnostic tests for pancreatic function; secretin is injected and the pancreatic output can then be imaged with [[magnetic resonance imaging]], a noninvasive procedure, or secretions generated as a result can gathered either through an endoscope or through tubes inserted through the mouth, down into the duodenum.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lieb|first1=John-G|title=Pancreatic function testing: Here to stay for the 21st century|journal=World Journal of Gastroenterology|date=2008|volume=14|issue=20|pages=3149|doi=10.3748/WJG.14.3149|pmid=18506918|pmc=2712845}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Domínguez Muñoz|first1=J.

==Research==
A wave of enthusiasm for secretin as a possible treatment for [[autism spectrum|autism]] arose in the 1990s based on a hypothetical gut-brain connection; as a result the NIH ran a series of clinical trials that showed that secretin was not effective, which brought an end to popular interest.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Stokstad|first1=Erik|title=News this Week: Stalled Trial for Autism Highlights Dilemma of Alternative Treatments|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/321/5887/news-summaries|work=Science|date=18 July 2008|pages=324|language=en}}</ref><ref name="urlThe Use of Secretin to Treat Autism">{{cite web |url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/news/releases/secretin.cfm |title=The Use of Secretin to Treat Autism |date=1998-10-16 |work=NIH News Alert |publisher=United States National Institutes of Health |accessdate=2008-11-30 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sandler AD, Sutton KA, DeWeese J, Girardi MA, Sheppard V, Bodfish JW |title=Lack of benefit of a single dose of synthetic human secretin in the treatment of autism and pervasive developmental disorder |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=341 |issue=24 |pages=1801–6 |year=1999 |pmid=10588965 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199912093412404 }}</ref>
