'''Apixaban''', sold under the tradename '''Eliquis''', is an [[anticoagulant]] for the treatment of [[venous thromboembolism|venous thromboembolic events]]. It is taken by mouth. It is a [[direct factor Xa inhibitor]].
 
Apixaban was approved in Europe in 2012.<ref>{{cite press release|title=ELIQUIS<sup>®</sup> (apixaban) Approved In Europe For Preventing Venous Thromboembolism After Elective Hip Or Knee Replacement |publisher=[[Pfizer]] |url=http://www.pfizer.com/news/press_releases/pfizer_press_release.jsp?guid=20110520005666en&source=RSS_2011&page=13 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120906042348/http://www.pfizer.com/news/press_releases/pfizer_press_release.jsp?guid=20110520005666en&source=RSS_2011&page=13 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 6, 2012 |date=April 20, 2012 |accessdate=2012-05-29 }}</ref> It was approved in the U.S. in 2014 for treatment and secondary prophylaxis of [[deep vein thrombosis]] (DVT) and [[pulmonary embolism]] (PE).<ref name="pfizer1">{{cite press release |title=U.S. FDA Approves Eliquis (apixaban) for the Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE), and for the Reduction in the Risk of Recurrent DVT and PE Following Initial Therapy |url=http://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/u_s_fda_approves_eliquis_apixaban_for_the_treatment_of_deep_vein_thrombosis_dvt_and_pulmonary_embolism_pe_and_for_the_reduction_in_the_risk_of_recurrent_dvt_and_pe_following_initial_therapy |publisher=Pfizer |date=August 21, 2014 |accessdate=2016-02-26}}</ref> It was developed in a joint venture by [[Pfizer]] and [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.bms.com/index.php?s=press_releases&item=254 | title = Bristol-Myers Squibb News Release 26 April 2007 | accessdate = 2007-09-15 | format = | work = | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070911112133/http://newsroom.bms.com/index.php?s=press_releases&item=254| archivedate= 11 September 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Nainggolan|first=Lisa|title=Apixaban better than European enoxaparin regimen for preventing VTE | url = http://www.theheart.org/article/1052599.do | accessdate = 2011-04-01 }}</ref>

==Medical uses==
Apixaban is indicated for the following:<ref name="PI" />
* To lower the risk of [[stroke]] and [[embolism]] in patients with nonvalvular [[atrial fibrillation]].
* [[Deep vein thrombosis]] (DVT) prophylaxis. DVTs may lead to [[pulmonary embolism]] (PE) in knee or hip replacement surgery patients. 
* Treatment of both DVT and PE.
* To reduce the risk of recurring DVT and PE after initial therapy.

===Atrial fibrillation===
Apixaban is recommended by the [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and at least one of the following risk factors: prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, age 75 years or older, [[diabetes mellitus]], or symptomatic [[heart failure]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta275/documents/stroke-and-systemic-embolism-prevention-nonvalvular-atrial-fibrillation-apixaban-final-appraisal-determination-document2 |title=Apixaban for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in people with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation |format=PDF |publisher=[[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] |date=January 2013 |accessdate=2016-02-26}}</ref>

Apixaban and other newer anticoagulants ([[dabigatran]] and [[rivaroxaban]]) appear equally effective as warfarin in preventing non-hemorrhagic stroke in people with atrial fibrillation and are associated with lower risk of intracranial bleeding.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gómez-Outes|first1=A|last2=Terleira-Fernández|first2=AI|last3=Calvo-Rojas|first3=G|last4=Suárez-Gea|first4=ML|last5=Vargas-Castrillón|first5=E|title=Dabigatran, Rivaroxaban, or Apixaban versus Warfarin in Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Subgroups.|journal=Thrombosis|date=2013|volume=2013|pages=640723|pmid=24455237|doi=10.1155/2013/640723|pmc=3885278}}</ref>

==Side effects==
Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including apixaban, increases thrombotic event risk. This is not due to any rebound effect from discontinuation. To reduce this risk, administering another anticoagulant is advised.<ref name="urlELIQUIS® (apixaban) tablets Factor Xa Inhibitor">{{cite web |url = http://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/drugsafety/postmarketdrugsafetyinformationforpatientsandproviders/ucm333723.pdf |title = ELIQUIS® (apixaban) tablets Factor Xa Inhibitor |date = August 2014 |publisher= FDA | accessdate= 2014-11-02}}</ref>

===Bleeding===
Apixaban can increase the risk of bleeding and may cause serious, potentially fatal, bleeding. Concurrent use with drugs affecting [[hemostasis]] (e.g. other anticoagulants, heparin, aspirin and other antiplatelet drugs, [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]], [[Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors|serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors]], and [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs|nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs) can further increase the risk of bleeding.<ref name="PI" />

One concern with the use of apixaban and the other newer anticoagulants is the absence of well-established protocol for reversal of their activity (no antidote is available).  This is an important disadvantage relative to warfarin when bleeding complications occur or when people taking the drugs require emergency surgery.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Enriquez A, Lip GY, Baranchuk A |title=Anticoagulation reversal in the era of the non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants |journal=Europace |volume= 18|issue= |pages= 955–64|year=2015 |pmid=25816811 |doi=10.1093/europace/euv030 |url=}}</ref>

===Spinal puncture===
When spinal/epidural anesthesia or puncture is utilized, patients who are being treated with anti-thrombotic agents for the prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk for developing a [[hematoma]], which can cause long-term or permanent paralysis. The risk of this may be increased by using epidural or intrathecal [[catheter]]s after a surgical operation or from the concurrent use of medicinal agents that affect [[hemostasis]].<ref name="PI" />

==Mechanism of action==
Apixaban is a highly selective, orally bioavailable, and reversible direct inhibitor of free and clot-bound [[factor Xa]]. Factor Xa catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, the final enzyme in the coagulation cascade that is responsible for [[fibrin]] clot formation.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Frost C, Wang J, Nepal S |title=Apixaban, an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor: single dose safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and food effect in healthy subjects |journal=Br J Clin Pharmacol |volume=75 |issue=2 |pages=476–87 | date=February 2013 |pmid=22759198 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.2012.04369.x|display-authors=etal |pmc=3558798}}</ref> Apixaban has no direct effect on [[platelet aggregation]], but by inhibiting factor Xa, it indirectly decreases clot formation induced by thrombin.<ref name="PI">{{cite web|title=Eliquis (apixaban) [prescribing information] |url=http://packageinserts.bms.com/pi/pi_eliquis.pdf |location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=Bristol-Myers Squibb |date=March 2014 |accessdate=2014-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024034839/http://packageinserts.bms.com/pi/pi_eliquis.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-24 }}</ref>

== FDA approval ==
A [[new drug application]] (NDA) for the approval of apixaban was submitted to the FDA by [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] and [[Pfizer]] jointly after conclusion of the ARISTOTLE clinical trial in 2011.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Granger, M.D. et. al.|first1=Christopher|title=Apixaban versus Warfarin in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date = September 15, 2011|issue=11|pages=981–992|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1107039|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1107039|accessdate=17 September 2015|volume=365|pmid=21870978}}</ref>

Apixaban was approved for the prevention of stroke in people with atrial fibrillation on December 28, 2012.<ref name="fda1">[http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm333634.htm FDA approves Eliquis to reduce the risk of stroke, blood clots in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation]</ref> On March 14, 2014, it was approved for the additional use of preventing [[deep vein thrombosis]] and [[pulmonary embolism]] in people that had recently undergone knee or hip replacement.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Neale|first1=Todd|title=FDA OKs Apixaban for DVT Prevention|url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/Cardiology/VenousThrombosis/44776| accessdate=17 September 2015| agency=MedPage Today| date=March 14, 2014}}</ref> 

On August 21, 2014, the FDA approved apixaban for the treatment of recurring [[deep vein thrombosis]] and [[pulmonary embolism]].<ref name="pfizer1"/>

During its development the drug was known as BMS-562247-01.
