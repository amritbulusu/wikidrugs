Naproxen's medical uses are related to its mechanism of action as an anti-inflammatory compound. Naproxen is used to treat a variety of inflammatory conditions and symptoms that are due to excessive [[inflammation]], such as [[pain]] and [[fever]] (naproxen has fever-reducing, or [[antipyretic]], properties in addition to its anti-inflammatory activity). Notably, not all medications that reduce fever are anti-inflammatory compounds (such as [[paracetamol]]). Inflammatory sources of pain that may respond to naproxen's anti-inflammatory activity are conditions such as [[migraine]], [[osteoarthritis]], [[kidney stones]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[psoriatic arthritis]], [[gout]], [[ankylosing spondylitis]], [[menstrual cramp]]s, [[tendinitis]] and [[bursitis]].<ref name="drugs" /> It is also used to treat primary [[dysmenorrhea]].<ref name="pmid15686299">{{cite journal | author = French L | title = Dysmenorrhea | journal = [[Am Fam Physician]] | volume = 71 | issue = 2 | pages = 285–91 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15686299 | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2005/0115/p285.pdf }}</ref>

Because of its anti-inflammatory mechanism of action, one would not expect naproxen to be useful in treating non-inflammatory causes of pain (e.g.,, [[diabetic neuropathy|diabetic nerve pain]]).

Naproxen is used as a "bridge therapy" in [[medication overuse headache|medication-overuse headache]] to wean patients off other medications.<ref name="Chronic HA">{{cite web|last1=Garza|first1=Ivan|last2=Schwedt|first2=Todd J.|title=Diagnosis and Management of Chronic Daily Headache|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/723842_4|website=medscape.com|publisher=WebMD LLC|accessdate=17 May 2017}}</ref>

===Diagnostics===

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Naproxen is a minor substrate of [[CYP1A2]] and [[CYP2C9]]. It is extensively metabolized in the liver to 6-O-desmethylnaproxen, and both the parent drug and the desmethyl metabolite undergo further metabolism to their respective acylglucuronide conjugated metabolites.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Vree|first1=Tom|last2=Van Den Biggelaar-Martea|first2=Magdalena|last3=Verwey-Van Wissen|first3=Corrien|last4=Vree|first4=Jeroen|last5=Guelen|first5=Pieter|title=Pharmacokinetics of naproxen, its metabolite O-desmethylnaproxen, and their acyl glucuronides in humans|journal=Biopharmaceutics & Drug Disposition|date=August 1993|volume=14|issue=6|pages=491-502|accessdate=21 July 2017}}</ref> An analysis of two [[clinical trials]] shows that naproxen's time to [[Cmax (pharmacology)|peak plasma concentration]] occurs between 2–4 hours after oral administration, though naproxen sodium reaches peak plasma concentrations within 1–2 hours.<ref name="CV Safety Review Article" />

==Use in horses==
Naproxen is given orally to horses at a dose of 10&nbsp;mg/kg, and has shown to have a wide safety margin (no toxicity when given at 3-times the recommended dose of 42 days).<ref>McIlwraith CW, Frisbie DD, Kawcak CE. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs. Proc. AAEP 2001 (47): 182-187.</ref> It is more effective for [[myositis]] than the commonly used NSAID [[phenylbutazone]], and has shown especially good results for treatment of [[equine exertional rhabdomyolysis]],<ref>May SA, Lees P.

==Synthesis==
Naproxen has been industrially produced by [[Syntex]] starting from [[2-naphthol]] as follows:<ref name = Harrington>{{cite journal | journal = [[Org. Process Res.
