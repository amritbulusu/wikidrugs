'''Pemoline''' is a [[stimulant]] drug of the 4-[[oxazolidinone]] class. It was first synthesized in 1913<ref>Chemische Berichte,1913,vol.46, p. 2083</ref> but its activity was not discovered until the 1930s.<ref>Acta Academiae Aboensis, Series B: Mathematica et Physica,   1939, vol. 11, #14 p. 3,7</ref> Under the names '''Betanamin''', '''Cylert''', '''Tradon''', and '''Ceractiv''' it was used as a medication to treat [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) and [[narcolepsy]]. Under the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]], it is a Schedule IV drug.<ref>[http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/green.pdf Annual Estimates Of Requirements Of Narcotic Drugs, Manufacture Of Synthetic Drugs, Opium Production And Cultivation Of The<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051205000000/http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/green.pdf |date=December 5, 2005 }}</ref> It is no longer generally available in the United States as a result of the FDA withdrawing approval of pemoline as an indicated treatment for ADHD, due to its implication in liver failures among children who were receiving the medication. An FDA Alert warned against prescribing pemoline for ADHD. This spurred Abbott Laboratories, the patent owner of Cylert, to cease manufacturing Cylert. Manufacturers of the generic equivalents followed suit.

==Mechanism of action==
Pemoline is generally considered [[dopaminergic]], but its precise method of action hasn't yet been definitively determined.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cylert (Pemoline)|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2003/016832s022_017703s018lbl.pdf|publisher=FDA|accessdate=15 February 2014|date=December 2002}}</ref> Pemoline passes the [[blood–brain barrier]] and acts as a surrogate for dopamine, not affecting endogenous intracellular dopamine. For this reason, and the fact that it has little or no affinity for adrenaline receptors, pemoline has minimal [[sympathomimetic]] side effects such as: dry mouth, reduction in appetite, high blood pressure, increased heart rate, constriction of smooth muscle, cardiac stress, dilated pupils and insomnia. There is some data to suggest that pemoline is a [[nootropic]] acting as a catalyst conductor in the synapses of the brain's memory centers, raising the efficiency of memory and assisting [[RNA]] formation in the brain. While drugs like [[dexamphetamine]] and [[methylphenidate]] are classified as [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule II controlled substances|Schedule II]], pemoline is listed as [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule IV controlled substances|Schedule IV]] (non-narcotic). In studies conducted on primates, pemoline fails to demonstrate a potential for self-administration.

Pemoline is Schedule IV Non-Narcotic (Stimulant) controlled substance with a DEA ACSCN of 1530 and is not subject to annual manufacturing quotas.  The salts in use are pemoline magnesium (free base conversion ratio .751), pemoline iron (.578), pemoline copper (.644), pemoline nickel (.578), pemoline rubidium, pemoline calcium, pemoline chromium, and chelates of the above which are identical in weight to the salt mentioned.  Pemoline free base and pemoline cobalt, strontium, silver, barium, lithium, sodium, potassium, zinc, manganese, and caesium are research chemicals which can be produced in situ for experiments.<ref>DEA office of Diversion Control site: Federal Register publications of CSA schedules, 2014 Q1</ref><ref>The A-Z Encyclopaedia of Alcohol and Drug Abuse</ref><ref>CRC Handbook of Chemistry & Physics</ref>  Others such as lanthanide pemoline salts such as pemoline cerium can be prepared; pemoline beryllium would presumably be toxic.

==Interactions==
Other stimulants and [[MAOI]]’s are contraindicated with pemoline.

==Liver toxicity==
In some patients pemoline is suspected of causing [[hepatotoxicity]],<ref name="pmid9602211">{{cite journal |vauthors=Marotta PJ, Roberts EA |title=Pemoline hepatotoxicity in children |journal=J.

In March 2005 [[Abbott Laboratories]] and generic manufacturers withdrew pemoline from the American market due to concerns about the liver toxicity risk.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Pemoline - Withdrawn due to liver toxicity risk | journal = WHO Pharmaceuticals Newsletter | year = 2005 | issue = 5 | url = http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js8120e/1.3.html#Js8120e.1.3}}</ref>

==Overdose==
Overdose of pemoline may present with [[choreoathetosis]] symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Stork CM, Cantor R |title=Pemoline induced acute choreoathetosis: case report and review of the literature |journal=J.

==Synthesis==
Pemoline is synthesized by the condensation of racemic [[mandelic acid|ethyl mandelate]] with [[guanidine]].
