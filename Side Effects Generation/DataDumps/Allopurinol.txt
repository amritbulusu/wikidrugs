==Medical uses==

===Gout===

Allopurinol is used to reduce urate/uric acid formation in conditions where urate/uric acid deposition has already occurred or is predictable.  The specific diseases and conditions where it is used include gouty arthritis, skin tophi, kidney stones, idiopathic gout; uric acid lithiasis; acute uric acid nephropathy; neoplastic disease and myeloproliferative disease with high cell turnover rates, in which high urate levels occur either spontaneously, or after cytotoxic therapy; certain enzyme disorders which lead to overproduction of urate, for example: [[hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase]], including [[Lesch–Nyhan syndrome]]; [[glucose 6-phosphatase]] including [[glycogen storage disease]]; [[Ribose-phosphate diphosphokinase|phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase]], [[Amidophosphoribosyltransferase|phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase]]; [[adenine phosphoribosyltransferase]].

It is also used to treat kidney stones caused by deficient activity of [[adenine phosphoribosyltransferase]].

===Tumor lysis syndrome===
Allopurinol was also commonly used to treat [[tumor lysis syndrome]] in chemotherapeutic treatments, as these regimens can rapidly produce severe acute hyperuricemia,<ref name=Labeltablet/> although it has gradually been replaced by [[urate oxidase]] therapy.<ref name="pmid11694945">{{cite journal |author= Jeha S. |title= Tumor lysis syndrome |journal= Semin Hematol.|volume= 38 |issue=4 Suppl 10 |pages=4–8 |year=2001 |pmid=11694945 |doi= 10.1016/S0037-1963(01)90037-X }}</ref>  IV formulations are used in this indication when people cannot take medicine by mouth.<ref name=Labelinject/>

===Inflammatory bowel disease===
Allopurinol cotherapy is used to improve outcomes for people with [[inflammatory bowel disease]] and [[Crohn's disease]] who do not respond to thiopurine monotherapy.<ref>Bradford K, Shih DQ. Optimizing 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine therapy in the management of inflammatory bowel disease. World J Gastroenterol. 2011 Oct 7;17(37):4166-73.

===Epilepsy===
Allopurinol is used as an add-on drug for refractory [[epilepsy]], because it is an adenosine agonist, which inhibits glutamine release from excitatory neurons, but does not change the plasma concentration of other epilepsy drugs.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1056/NEJMc1111683 |title=Drug-Resistant Epilepsy|journal=N Engl J Med|year=2011|volume=365|issue=23|pages=2238–2240}}</ref>

==Contraindications and drug interactions==
Allopurinol should not be given to people who are allergic to it.<ref name=Labeltablet/>

Drug interactions are extensive, and are as follows:<ref name=Labeltablet/>

* [[Azathioprine]] and [[6-mercaptopurine]]: Azathioprine is metabolised to 6-mercaptopurine which in turn is inactivated by the action of xanthine oxidase - the target of allopurinol.  Giving allopurinol with either of these drugs at their normal dose will lead to overdose of either drug;  only one-quarter of the usual dose of 6-mercaptopurine or azathioprine should be given;
* [[Didanosine]]: plasma didanosine Cmax and AUC values were approximately doubled with concomitant allopurinol treatment; it should not be co-administered with allopuroinol and if it must be, the dose of should be reduced and the person should be closely monitored.

Allopurinol may also increase the activity or half-life of the following drugs, in order of seriousness and certainty of the interaction:<ref name=Labeltablet/>
* [[Ciclosporin]]
* [[Coumarin]] anticoagulants (reported rarely, but is serious when it occurs)
* [[Vidarabine]]
* [[Chlorpropamide]]
* [[Phenytoin]]
* [[Theophylline]]
* [[Cyclophosphamide]], [[doxorubicin]], [[bleomycin]], [[procarbazine]], [[mechlorethamine]]

Co-administration of the following drugs may make allopurinol less active or decrease its half-life:<ref name=Labeltablet/>
* [[Salicylates]] and [[uricosuric|medicines that increase the secretion of uric acid]]
* [[furosemide]] (see more on diuretics below)

Co-administration of the following drugs may cause hypersensitivity or skin rash:<ref name=Labeltablet/>
* [[Ampicillin]] and [[amoxicillin]]
* [[Diuretics]], in particular thiazides, especially in renal impairment
* [[ACE inhibitors|Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors]] (ACE inhibitors)

== Side effects ==
Because allopurinol is not a [[uricosuric]], it can be used in people with poor [[kidney]] function.  However, allopurinol has two important disadvantages.

First, its dosing is complex.<ref name="pmid17897242">{{cite journal |pages=391–5 |doi=10.1111/j.1525-139X.2007.00270.x |title=Allopurinol Dosing in Renal Impairment: Walking the Tightrope Between Adequate Urate Lowering and Adverse Events |year=2007 |last1=Dalbeth |first1=Nicola |last2=Stamp |first2=Lisa |journal=Seminars in Dialysis |volume=20 |issue=5 |pmid=17897242}}</ref> Second, some patients are hypersensitive to the drug, therefore its use requires careful monitoring.<ref name=Derm2016rev/><ref name="pmid20509717">{{cite journal |vauthors= Tsai TF, Yeh TY |title= Allopurinol in dermatology |journal= Am J Clin Dermatol. |volume= 11 |issue=4 |pages=225–232 |year=2010 |pmid=20509717 |doi=10.2165/11533190-000000000-00000}}</ref>

Allopurinol has rare but potentially fatal adverse effects involving the skin. The most serious adverse effect is a hypersensitivity syndrome consisting of fever, skin rash, [[eosinophilia]], [[hepatitis]], and worsened renal function.<ref name=Derm2016rev/> Allopurinol is one of the drugs commonly known to cause [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]] and [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]], two life-threatening [[dermatology|dermatological]] conditions.<ref name=Derm2016rev/> More common is a less-serious rash that leads to discontinuing this drug.<ref name=Derm2016rev>{{cite journal|last1=Chung|first1=WH|last2=Wang|first2=CW|last3=Dao|first3=RL|title=Severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions.|journal=The Journal of dermatology|date=July 2016|volume=43|issue=7|pages=758–66|pmid=27154258|doi=10.1111/1346-8138.13430}}</ref>

More rarely, allopurinol can also result in the depression of bone marrow elements, leading to [[cytopenia]]s, as well as [[aplastic anemia]]. Moreover, allopurinol can also cause [[peripheral neuritis]] in some patients, although this is a rare side effect. Another side effect of allopurinol is [[interstitial nephritis]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Marc E. De Broe |author2=William M. Bennett |author3=George A. Porter |title=Clinical Nephrotoxins: Renal Injury from Drugs and Chemicals |url=https://books.google.com/?id=sLM8F-IBgNcC&pg=PA317&dq=interstitial+nephritis+allopurinol#v=onepage&q=interstitial%20nephritis%20allopurinol&f=false|year=2003|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|quote=Acute interstitial nephritis has also been reported associated with by the administration of allopurinol.|isbn=9781402012778}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==

A common misconception is that allopurinol is metabolized by its target, [[xanthine oxidase]], but this action is principally carried out by [[aldehyde oxidase]].<ref name="pmid2323062">{{cite journal |vauthors=Reiter S, Simmonds HA, Zöllner N |title= Demonstration of a combined deficiency of xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase in xanthinuric patients not forming oxipurinol |journal= Clin Chim Acta |volume= 187 |issue=3 |pages=221–234 |year=1990 |pmid=2323062 |doi= 10.1016/0009-8981(90)90107-4  |displayauthors= etal  }}</ref> The active [[metabolite]] of allopurinol is [[oxipurinol]], which is also an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. Allopurinol is almost completely metabolized to oxipurinol within two hours of oral administration, whereas oxipurinol is slowly excreted by the kidneys over 18–30 hours. For this reason, oxipurinol is believed responsible for the majority of allopurinol's effect.<ref name="pmid17655371">{{cite journal |vauthors=Day RO, Graham GG, Hicks M |title= Clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of allopurinol and oxypurinol |journal= Clin Pharmacokinet. |volume= 46 |issue=8 |pages=623–644 |year=2007 |pmid=17655371 |doi= 10.2165/00003088-200746080-00001  |displayauthors= etal  }}</ref>

=== Mechanism of action ===
Allopurinol is a purine analog; it is a structural [[isomer]] of [[hypoxanthine]] (a naturally occurring [[purine]] in the body) and is an [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] of the enzyme [[xanthine oxidase]].<ref name=Patcher2006rev/> Xanthine oxidase is responsible for the successive oxidation of hypoxanthine and [[xanthine]], resulting in the production of [[uric acid]], the product of human purine metabolism.<ref name=Patcher2006rev/> In addition to blocking uric acid production, inhibition of xanthine oxidase causes an increase in hypoxanthine and xanthine. While xanthine cannot be converted to purine ribotides, hypoxanthine can be salvaged to the purine [[ribotide]]s [[adenosine monophosphate|adenosine]] and [[guanosine monophosphate]]s. Increased levels of these ribotides may cause feedback inhibition of [[amidophosphoribosyl transferase]], the first and rate-limiting enzyme of purine biosynthesis. Allopurinol, therefore, decreases uric acid formation and may also inhibit purine synthesis.<ref name="pmid8439471">{{cite journal |vauthors= Cameron JS, Moro F, Simmonds HA |title= Gout, uric acid and purine metabolism in paediatric nephrology |journal= Pediatr Nephrol.|volume= 7 |issue=1 |pages=105–118 |year=1993 |pmid=8439471 |doi= 10.1007/BF00861588 }}</ref>

===Pharmacogenetics===
The HLA-B*5801 allele is a genetic marker for allopurinol-induced severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).<ref name="pharmgkb.org">http://www.pharmgkb.org/haplotype/PA165956630#tabview=tab3&subtab=</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">http://www.pharmgkb.org/pathway/PA165980774</ref> The frequency of the HLA-B*5801 allele varies between ethnicities: Han Chinese and Thai populations have HLA-B*5801 [[allele frequency|allele frequencies]] of around 8%, as compared to European and Japanese populations, who have allele frequencies of around 1.0% and 0.5%, respectively.<ref>http://www.allelefrequencies.net</ref> The increase in risk for developing allopurinol-induced SJS or TEN in individuals with the HLA-B*5801 allele (as compared to those who do not have this allele) is very high, ranging from a 40-fold to a 580-fold increase in risk, depending on ethnicity.<ref name="pharmgkb.org"/><ref name="ReferenceA"/> As of 2011 the FDA-approved drug label for allopurinol did not contain any information regarding the HLA-B*5801 allele, though FDA scientists did publish a study in 2011 which reported a strong, reproducible and consistent association between the allele and allopurinol-induced SJS and TEN.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Zineh I, Mummaneni P, Lyndly J |title=Allopurinol pharmacogenetics: assessment of potential clinical usefulness|journal=Pharmacogenomics|volume=12 |issue=12|pages=1741–9|date=December 2011|pmid= 22118056|pmc=|doi=10.2217/pgs.11.131|url=|displayauthors=etal }}</ref> However, the American College of Rheumatology recommends screening for HLA-B*5801 in high-risk populations (''e.g.'' Koreans with stage 3 or worse chronic kidney disease and those of Han Chinese and Thai descent), and prescribing patients who are positive for the allele an alternative drug.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Khanna D, Fitzgerald JD, Khanna PP |title=2012 American College of Rheumatology guidelines for management of gout.

== History ==
Allopurinol was first synthesized and reported in 1956 by Roland K. Robins (1926-1992), in a search for antineoplastic agents.<ref name=Patcher2006rev/><ref>{{cite journal | author = R. K.
