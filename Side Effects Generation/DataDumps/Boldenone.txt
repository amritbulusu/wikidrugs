'''Boldenone''', also known as '''Δ<sup>1</sup>-testosterone''', is a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]] [[anabolic-androgenic steroid]] (AAS) and the 1(2)-[[dehydrogenated]] [[structural analog|analogue]] of [[testosterone]]. Boldenone itself has never been marketed; as a [[pharmaceutical drug]], it is used as [[boldenone undecylenate]], the [[undecylic acid|undecylenate]] [[ester]].

==Side effects==
{{See also|Anabolic steroid#Adverse effects}}

==Pharmacology==
The activity of boldenone is mainly [[anabolic]], with a low [[androgenic]] potency. Boldenone will increase [[nitrogen]] retention, protein synthesis, increases appetite and stimulates the release of [[erythropoietin]] in the kidneys.<ref>Forbes GB (1985) The effect of anabolic steroids on lean body mass the dose response curve. Metab Clin Exp 34(6) 571–573</ref> Boldenone was synthesized in an attempt to create a long-acting injectable [[methandrostenolone]] (Dianabol), for androgen deficiency disorders. Boldenone acts similar to methandrostenolone with fewer adverse androgenic effects.{{medcn|date=September 2015}}  Although commonly compared to [[nandrolone]], boldenone lacks progesterone receptor interaction and all the associated [[progestogen]]ic side effects.

==Chemistry==
{{See also|List of androgens/anabolic steroids}}

Boldenone, also known as '''Δ<sup>1</sup>-testosterone''', '''1-dehydrotestosterone''', or '''androsta-1,4-dien-17β-ol-3-one''', is a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]] [[androstane]] [[steroid]] and a [[chemical derivative|derivative]] of [[testosterone]]. It is specifically testosterone with a [[double bond]] between the C1 and C2 positions.
