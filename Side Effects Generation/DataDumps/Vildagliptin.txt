'''Vildagliptin''' (previously '''LAF237''', trade names '''Galvus''', '''Zomelis''',) is an oral anti-hyperglycemic agent ([[anti-diabetic drug]]) of the new [[DPP-4 inhibitors|dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor]] class of drugs. Vildagliptin inhibits the inactivation of [[Glucagon-like peptide-1|GLP-1]]<ref name=ahren/><ref name=mentlein/> and [[glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide|GIP]]<ref name=mentlein>{{cite journal | last1 = Mentlein | first1 = R | last2 = Gallwitz | first2 = B | last3 = Schmidt | first3 = WE | title = Dipeptidyl-peptidase IV hydrolyses gastric inhibitory polypeptide, glucagon-like peptide-1(7-36)amide, peptide histidine methionine and is responsible for their degradation in human serum | journal = European Journal of Biochemistry / FEBS | volume = 214 | issue = 3 | pages = 829–35 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8100523 | doi=10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb17986.x}}</ref> by DPP-4, allowing GLP-1 and GIP to potentiate the secretion of insulin in the beta cells and suppress glucagon release by the alpha cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas.

==Combination with metformin==
The [[European Medicines Agency|EMEA]] has also approved a new oral treatment released by Novartis, called '''Eucreas''', a combination of vildagliptin and [[metformin]].<ref name=reuters_eucreas>EU approves Novartis's Eucreas diabetes drug. [https://www.reuters.com/article/companyNews/idUSZAT00747520080225 Reuters, February 25, 2008].</ref>

==Adverse Effects==
Adverse effects observed in clinical trials include nausea, hypoglycemia, tremor, headache and dizziness. Rare cases of hepatoxicity have been reported.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Product_Information/human/000771/WC500020327.pdf |title=www.ema.europa.eu |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

There have been case reports of pancreatitis associated with DPP-IV inhibitors. A group at UCLA reported increased pre-cancerous pancreatic changes in rats and in human organ donors who had been treated with DPP-IV inhibitors.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Matveyenko AV, Dry S, Cox HI, etal |title=Beneficial endocrine but adverse exocrine effects of sitagliptin in the human islet amyloid polypeptide transgenic rat model of type 2 diabetes: interactions with metformin |journal=Diabetes |volume=58 |issue=7 |pages=1604–15 |date=July 2009  |pmid=19403868 |pmc=2699878 |doi=10.2337/db09-0058 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors =Butler AE, Campbell-Thompson M, Gurlo T, Dawson DW, Atkinson M, Butler PC |title=Marked expansion of exocrine and endocrine pancreas with incretin therapy in humans with increased exocrine pancreas dysplasia and the potential for glucagon-producing neuroendocrine tumors |journal=Diabetes |volume=62 |issue=7 |pages=2595–604 |date=July 2013  |pmid=23524641 |doi=10.2337/db12-1686 |url= |pmc=3712065}}</ref> In response to these reports, the United States FDA and the European Medicines Agency each undertook independent reviews of all clinical and preclinical data related to the possible association of DPP-IV inhibitors with pancreatic cancer. In a joint letter to the New England Journal of Medicines, the agencies stated that "Both agencies agree that assertions concerning a causal association between incretin-based drugs and pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer, as expressed recently in the scientific literature and in the media, are inconsistent with the current data. The FDA and the EMA have not reached a final conclusion at this time regarding such a causal relationship. Although the totality of the data that have been reviewed provides reassurance, pancreatitis will continue to be considered a risk associated with these drugs until more data are available; both agencies continue to investigate this safety signal."<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1314078 |pmid=24571751 |title=Pancreatic Safety of Incretin-Based Drugs — FDA and EMA Assessment — NEJM |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=370 |issue=9 |pages=794–7 |format= |work= |accessdate=|year=2014 |last1=Egan |first1=Amy G. |last2=Blind |first2=Eberhard |last3=Dunder |first3=Kristina |last4=De Graeff |first4=Pieter A. |last5=Hummer |first5=B.
