'''Clofibrate''' (tradename '''Atromid-S''') is an [[organic compound]].  It is marketed as a [[fibrate]]. It is a lipid-lowering agent used for controlling the high cholesterol and [[triacylglyceride]] level in the blood. It increases [[lipoprotein lipase]] activity to promote the conversion of [[VLDL]] to [[LDL]], and hence reduce the level of VLDL. It can increase the level of [[High Density Lipoprotein|HDL]] as well. 

==Complications and controversies==
It can induce [[syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion|SIADH]], syndrome of inappropriate secretion of [[vasopressin|antidiuretic hormone ADH]] (vasopressin). Clofibrate can also result in formation of cholesterol stones in the gallbladder.

The [[World Health Organization]] Cooperative Trial on Primary Prevention of [[Ischaemic Heart Disease]] using clofibrate to lower serum [[cholesterol]] observed excess mortality in the clofibrate-treated group despite successful cholesterol lowering (47% more deaths during treatment with clofibrate and 5% after treatment with clofibrate) than the non-treated high cholesterol group. These deaths were due to a wide variety of causes other than heart disease, and remain "unexplained".<ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=WHO cooperative trial on primary prevention of ischaemic heart disease with clofibrate to lower serum cholesterol: final mortality follow-up.

Clofibrate was discontinued in 2002 due to adverse effects.
