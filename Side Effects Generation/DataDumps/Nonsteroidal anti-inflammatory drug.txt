'''Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs''' ('''NSAIDs''') are a [[drug class]] that groups together [[drug]]s that [[analgesic|reduce pain]], [[antipyretic|decrease fever]], and, in higher doses, [[anti-inflammatory|decrease inflammation]]. Side effects include an increased risk of [[stomach ulcers]] and [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bally|first1=M|last2=Dendukuri|first2=N|last3=Rich|first3=B|last4=Nadeau|first4=L|last5=Helin-Salmivaara|first5=A|last6=Garbe|first6=E|last7=Brophy|first7=JM|title=Risk of acute myocardial infarction with NSAIDs in real world use: bayesian meta-analysis of individual patient data.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=9 May 2017|volume=357|pages=j1909|pmid=28487435}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lanas|first1=A|last2=Chan|first2=FK|title=Peptic ulcer disease.|journal=Lancet|date=23 February 2017|pmid=28242110}}</ref>

The term ''nonsteroidal'' distinguishes these drugs from [[steroid]]s, which, among a broad range of other effects, have a similar [[eicosanoid]]-depressing, anti-inflammatory action. First used in 1960, the term served to distance these medications from steroids.<ref name="Buer_2014">{{cite journal |vauthors=Buer JK |title=Origins and impact of the term 'NSAID' |journal=Inflammopharmacology |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=263–7 |date=Oct 2014 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264248818_Origins_and_impact_of_the_term_'NSAID' |pmid=25064056 |doi=10.1007/s10787-014-0211-2 }}</ref>

It treats pain mainly by blocking COX-2 mostly in the central nervous system, but not much in the rest of the body.<ref name="Hinz_2008" />

Most NSAIDs inhibit the activity of [[cyclooxygenase]]-1 (COX-1) and [[COX-2 inhibitor|cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)]], and thereby the synthesis of [[prostaglandins]] and [[thromboxane]]s. It is thought that inhibiting COX-2 leads to the anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic effects and that those NSAIDs also inhibiting COX-1, particularly aspirin, may cause gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcers in large doses.<ref name=integrada>Clive P.

[[Aspirin]], the only NSAID able to irreversibly inhibit [[COX-1]], is also indicated for inhibition of [[platelet]] aggregation. This is useful for the management of arterial [[thrombosis]] and prevention of adverse cardiovascular events. Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by inhibiting the action of [[thromboxane A2|thromboxane A<sub>2</sub>]].

NSAIDs are useful in the management of post-operative dental pain following invasive dental procedures such as dental extraction. When not contra-indicated they are favoured over the use of paracetamol alone due to the anti-inflammatory effect they provide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sdcep.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SDCEP-Drug-Prescribing-for-Dentistry-3rd-edition.pdf |title=SDCEP Guidance on prescribing in Dentistry |last= |first=|date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=}}</ref>  When used in combination with paracetamol the analgesic effect has been proven to be improved.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Moore |first=R.

An estimated 10–20% of NSAID patients experience [[dyspepsia]]. In the 1990s high doses of prescription NSAIDs were associated with serious upper gastrointestinal adverse events, including bleeding.<ref name="pmid11464731"/> Over the past decade, deaths associated with gastric bleeding have declined.

NSAIDs, like all drugs, may interact with other medications. For example, concurrent use of NSAIDs and [[Quinolone antibiotic|quinolones]] may increase the risk of quinolones' adverse [[central nervous system]] effects, including seizure.<ref>

If a [[COX-2 inhibitor]] is taken, a traditional NSAID (prescription or over-the-counter) should not be taken at the same time.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070129065844/http://orthoinfo.aaos.org:80/fact/thr_report.cfm?Thread_ID=398&topcategory=About ]</ref>{{Failed verification|date=March 2014}} In addition, people on daily aspirin therapy (e.g., for reducing cardiovascular risk) must be careful if they also use other NSAIDs, as these may inhibit the cardioprotective effects of aspirin.

===Gastrointestinal===

The main adverse drug reactions ([[adverse drug reactions|ADRs]]) associated with NSAID use relate to direct and indirect irritation of the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] (GI) tract. NSAIDs cause a dual assault on the GI tract: the acidic molecules directly irritate the [[gastric mucosa]], and inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 reduces the levels of protective [[prostaglandins]]. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the GI tract causes increased gastric acid secretion, diminished bicarbonate secretion, diminished mucus secretion and diminished trophic{{Clarify |date=July 2010}} effects on the epithelial mucosa.

Common gastrointestinal ADRs include:<ref name="isbn0-9757919-2-3"/>

* Nausea/vomiting
* [[Dyspepsia]]
* [[Gastric ulcer]]ation/bleeding<ref name="pmid7888445">{{cite journal |vauthors=Traversa G, Walker AM, Ippolito FM, Caffari B, Capurso L, Dezi A, Koch M, Maggini M, Alegiani SS, Raschetti R |title=Gastroduodenal toxicity of different nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs |journal=Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.) |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=49–54 |date=January 1995 |pmid=7888445 |doi=10.1097/00001648-199501000-00010 |issn=1044-3983 }}</ref>
* [[Diarrhea]]

Clinical NSAID ulcers are related to the systemic effects of NSAID administration. Such damage occurs irrespective of the route of administration of the NSAID (e.g., oral, rectal, or parenteral) and can occur even in patients with [[achlorhydria]].<ref>Textbook of Gastroenterology, Tadataka Yamada, 2008, Ch.40, Peptic Ulcer Disease, page 941</ref>

Ulceration risk increases with therapy duration, and with higher doses. To minimize GI ADRs, it is prudent to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time—a practice that studies show is often not followed. Recent studies show that over 50% of patients who take NSAIDs have sustained some mucosal damage to their small intestine.<ref name="pmid19568687">{{cite journal |vauthors=Higuchi K, Umegaki E, Watanabe T, Yoda Y, Morita E, Murano M, Tokioka S, Arakawa T |title=Present status and strategy of NSAIDs-induced small bowel injury |journal=Journal of Gastroenterology |volume=44 |issue=9 |pages=879–888 |date=July 2009 |pmid=19568687 |doi=10.1007/s00535-009-0102-2 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/p637716362731058/ |issn=1435-5922 }}</ref>

There are also some differences in the propensity of individual agents to cause gastrointestinal ADRs. [[Indomethacin]], [[ketoprofen]] and [[piroxicam]] appear to have the highest prevalence of gastric ADRs, while [[ibuprofen]] (lower doses) and [[diclofenac]] appear to have lower rates.<ref name="isbn0-9757919-2-3"/>

Certain NSAIDs, such as aspirin, have been marketed in [[enteric coating|enteric-coated]] formulations that manufacturers claim reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal ADRs. Similarly, some believe that rectal formulations may reduce gastrointestinal ADRs. However, consistent with the systemic mechanism of such ADRs, and in clinical practice, these formulations have not demonstrated a reduced risk of GI ulceration.<ref name="isbn0-9757919-2-3"/>

Commonly, gastric (but not necessarily intestinal) adverse effects can be reduced through suppressing acid production, by concomitant use of a [[proton pump inhibitor]], e.g., [[omeprazole]], [[esomeprazole]], or the prostaglandin analog [[misoprostol]]. Misoprostol is itself associated with a high incidence of gastrointestinal ADRs (diarrhea). While these techniques may be effective, they are expensive for maintenance therapy.

===Inflammatory bowel disease===

NSAIDs should be used with caution in individuals with [[inflammatory bowel disease]] (e.g., [[Crohn's disease]] or [[ulcerative colitis]]) due to their tendency to cause gastric bleeding and form ulceration in the gastric lining.

===Renal===
NSAIDs are also associated with a fairly high incidence of adverse drug reactions ([[adverse drug reactions|ADRs]]) on the kidney and over time can lead to [[chronic kidney disease]]. The mechanism of these kidney ADRs is due to changes in kidney blood flow. Prostaglandins normally dilate the [[afferent arteriole]]s of the [[glomerulus|glomeruli]]. This helps maintain normal glomerular perfusion and [[glomerular filtration rate]] (GFR), an indicator of [[renal function|kidney function]]. This is particularly important in kidney failure where the kidney is trying to maintain renal perfusion pressure by elevated angiotensin II levels. At these elevated levels, angiotensin II also constricts the afferent arteriole into the glomerulus in addition to the efferent arteriole it normally constricts. Since NSAIDs block this prostaglandin-mediated effect of afferent arteriole dilation, particularly in kidney failure, NSAIDs cause unopposed constriction of the afferent arteriole and decreased RPF (renal perfusion flow) and GFR.

Common ADRs associated with altered kidney function include:<ref name="isbn0-9757919-2-3"/>

* Salt ([[Sodium]]) and fluid retention
* [[Hypertension]] (high blood pressure)

These agents may also cause kidney impairment, especially in combination with other nephrotoxic agents. Kidney failure is especially a risk if the patient is also concomitantly taking an [[ACE inhibitor]] (which removes angiotensin II's vasoconstriction of the efferent arteriole) and a [[diuretic]] (which drops plasma volume, and thereby RPF)—the so-called "triple whammy" effect.<ref name="pmid10772593">{{cite journal |author=Thomas MC |title=Diuretics, ACE inhibitors and NSAIDs—the triple whammy |journal=The Medical journal of Australia |volume=172 |issue=4 |pages=184–5 |date=February 2000 |pmid=10772593 |issn=0025-729X }}</ref>

In rarer instances NSAIDs may also cause more severe kidney conditions:<ref name="isbn0-9757919-2-3"/>

* [[Interstitial nephritis]]
* [[Nephrotic syndrome]]
* [[Acute kidney failure]]
* [[Acute tubular necrosis]]
* [[Renal papillary necrosis]]

NSAIDs in combination with excessive use of [[phenacetin]] or [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) may lead to [[analgesic nephropathy]].<ref name="pmid9459649">{{cite journal |vauthors=De Broe ME, Elseviers MM |title=Analgesic nephropathy |journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume=338 |issue=7 |pages=446–52 |date=February 1998 |pmid=9459649 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199802123380707 |issn=0028-4793 }}</ref>

===Photosensitivity===

[[Photodermatitis|Photosensitivity]] is a commonly overlooked adverse effect of many of the NSAIDs.<ref name="pmid12020173">{{cite journal |author=Moore DE |title=Drug-induced cutaneous photosensitivity: incidence, mechanism, prevention and management |journal=Drug Safety |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=345–72 |year=2002 |pmid=12020173 |doi=10.2165/00002018-200225050-00004 |issn=0114-5916 }}</ref> The 2-arylpropionic acids are the most likely to produce photosensitivity reactions, but other NSAIDs have also been implicated including [[piroxicam]], [[diclofenac]] and [[benzydamine]].

[[Benoxaprofen]], since withdrawn due to its [[hepatotoxicity|liver toxicity]], was the most photoactive NSAID observed. The mechanism of photosensitivity, responsible for the high photoactivity of the 2-arylpropionic acids, is the ready [[decarboxylation]] of the [[carboxylic acid]] [[functional group|moiety]]. The specific absorbance characteristics of the different [[chromophore|chromophoric]] 2-aryl substituents, affects the decarboxylation mechanism. While [[ibuprofen]] has weak absorption, it has been reported as a weak photosensitising agent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

NSAIDs are not recommended during pregnancy, particularly during the [[third trimester]].

===Allergy/allergy-like hypersensitivity reactions===

A variety of allergic or allergic-like [[NSAID hypersensitivity reactions]] follow the ingestion of NSAIDs.  These hypersensitivity reactions differ from the other adverse reactions listed here which are toxicity reactions, i.e. unwanted reactions that result from the pharmacological action of a drug, are dose-related, and can occur in any treated individual; hypersensitivity reactions are idiosyncratic reactions to a drug.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kowalski ML, Makowska JS |title=Seven steps to the diagnosis of NSAIDs hypersensitivity: how to apply a new classification in real practice? |journal=Allergy Asthma Immunol Res. |year=2015 |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=312–320 |doi=10.4168/aair.2015.7.4.312 |pmid=25749768 |pmc=4446629 |url=http://e-aair.org/DOIx.php?id=10.4168/aair.2015.7.4.312}} {{open access}}</ref>  Some NSAID hypersensitivity reactions are truly allergic in origin: '''1)''' repetitive [[IgE]]-mediated [[urticarial]] skin eruptions, [[angioedema]], and [[anaphylaxis]] following immediately to hours after ingesting one structural type of NSAID but not after ingesting structurally unrelated NSAIDs; and '''2)''' Comparatively mild to moderately severe [[T cell]]-mediated delayed onset (usually more than 24 hour), skin reactions such as [[maculopapular rash]], [[fixed drug eruption]]s, [[photosensitivity reaction]]s, delayed [[urticaria]], and [[contact dermatitis]]; or '''3)''' far more severe and potentially life-threatening t-cell-mediated delayed systemic reactions such as the [[DRESS syndrome]], [[acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis]], the [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]], and [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]].  Other NSAID hypersensitivity reactions are allergy-like symptoms but do not involve true allergic mechanisms; rather, they appear due to the ability of NSAIDs to alter the metabolism of arachidonic acid in favor of forming metabolites that promote allergic symptoms.  Afflicted individuals may be abnormally sensitive to these provocative metabolites or overproduce them and typically are susceptible to a wide range of structurally dissimilar NSAIDs, particularly those that inhibit COX1.  Symptoms, which develop immediately to hours after ingesting any of various NSAIDs that inhibit COX-1, are: '''1)''' exacerbations of asthmatic and rhinitis (see [[aspirin-induced asthma]]) symptoms in individuals with a history of [[asthma]] or [[rhinitis]] and '''2)''' exacerbation or first-time development of [[wheals]] or [[angioedema]] in individuals with or without a history of chronic [[urticarial]] lesions or angioedema.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

NSAIDs are also implicated in some cases of [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]].

Most NSAIDs penetrate poorly into the [[central nervous system]] (CNS). However, the COX enzymes are expressed constitutively in some areas of the CNS, meaning that even limited penetration may cause adverse effects such as somnolence and dizziness.

Various widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) enhance [[endocannabinoid]] signaling by blocking the anandamide-degrading membrane enzyme [[fatty acid amide hydrolase]] ([[FAAH]]).<ref name="pmid23240907">{{cite journal |vauthors=Bertolacci L, Romeo E, Veronesi M, Magotti P, Albani C, Dionisi M, Lambruschini C, Scarpelli R, Cavalli A, De Vivo M, Piomelli D, Garau G |title=A binding site for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in fatty acid amide hydrolase |journal=J Am Chem Soc. 2013 |volume=135 |issue=1 |pages=22–25 |doi=10.1021/ja308733u |pmid=23240907 |date=Jan 2013 |pmc=3562592}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==

Most NSAIDs act as nonselective inhibitors of the [[enzyme]] [[cyclooxygenase]] (COX), inhibiting both the [[cyclooxygenase-1]] (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) [[isoenzyme]]s. This inhibition is competitively [[Reversible inhibition#Reversible inhibitors|reversible]] (albeit at varying degrees of reversibility), as opposed to the mechanism of [[aspirin]], which is irreversible inhibition.<ref>{{cite web |last=Knights |first=Kathleen |title=Defining the COX Inhibitor Selectivity of NSAIDs: Implications for Understanding Toxicity |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/733075_5 |publisher=Web MD LLC |accessdate=17 February 2013}}</ref>  COX catalyzes the formation of [[prostaglandin]]s and [[thromboxane]] from [[arachidonic acid]] (itself derived from the cellular [[phospholipid]] bilayer by [[phospholipase A2|phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>]]). Prostaglandins act (among other things) as messenger molecules in the process of [[inflammation]]. This [[mechanism of action]] was elucidated by [[John Vane]] (1927–2004), who received a [[Nobel Prize]] for his work (see [[Mechanism of action of aspirin]]).

COX-1 is a constitutively expressed enzyme with a "house-keeping" role in regulating many normal physiological processes. One of these is in the [[stomach]] lining, where prostaglandins serve a protective role, preventing the stomach [[mucosa]] from being eroded by its own acid. COX-2 is an enzyme facultatively expressed in inflammation, and it is inhibition of COX-2 that produces the desirable effects of NSAIDs.

When nonselective COX-1/COX-2 inhibitors (such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen) lower stomach prostaglandin levels, [[peptic ulcer|ulcers]] of the [[stomach]] or [[duodenum]] internal [[bleeding]] can result.

NSAIDs have been studied in various assays to understand how they affect each of these enzymes.  While the assays reveal differences, unfortunately, different assays provide differing ratios.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jpp.krakow.pl/journal/archive/11_06_s5/pdf/113_11_06_s5_article.pdf |title=INHIBIT ORS OF CYCLOOXYGENASES: MECHANISMS, SELECTIVITY AND USES |publisher=Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology |accessdate=16 March 2014}}</ref>

The discovery of COX-2 led to research to the development of selective COX-2 inhibiting drugs that do not cause gastric problems characteristic of older NSAIDs.

[[Paracetamol]] (acetaminophen)  is not considered an NSAID because it has little anti-inflammatory activity.  It treats pain mainly by blocking COX-2 mostly in the central nervous system, but not much in the rest of the body.<ref name="Hinz_2008" />

However, many aspects of the mechanism of action of NSAIDs remain unexplained, and for this reason, further COX pathways are hypothesized. The [[COX-3]] pathway was believed to fill some of this gap but recent findings make it appear unlikely that it plays any significant role in humans and alternative explanation models are proposed.<ref name="Hinz_2008">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hinz B, Cheremina O, Brune K |title=Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor in man. |journal=The FASEB Journal |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=383–390 |year=2008 |pmid=17884974 |doi=10.1096/fj.07-8506com }}</ref>

NSAIDs interact with the [[endocannabinoid system]] and its [[endocannabinoids]], as COX2 have been shown to utilize endocannabinoids as substrates, and may have a key role in both the [[Therapeutic effect|therapeutic]] and [[Adverse effect|adverse]] effects of NSAIDs, as well as in NSAIDs-induced [[placebo]] responses.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fowler |first=C J |date=2017-01-27 |title=The contribution of cyclooxygenase-2 to endocannabinoid metabolism and action |journal=British Journal of Pharmacology |volume=152 |issue=5 |pages=594–601 |doi=10.1038/sj.bjp.0707379 |issn=0007-1188 |pmc=2190012 |pmid=17618306}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Rouzer |first=Carol A. |last2=Marnett |first2=Lawrence J. |date=2008-03-28 |title=Non-redundant Functions of Cyclooxygenases: Oxygenation of  Endocannabinoids |journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=283 |issue=13 |pages=8065–8069 |doi=10.1074/jbc.R800005200 |issn=0021-9258 |pmc=2417164 |pmid=18250160}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Hamza |first=May |last2=Dionne |first2=Raymond A. |date=2009-01-01 |title=Mechanisms of Non-Opioid Analgesics Beyond Cyclooxygenase Enzyme Inhibition |journal=Current molecular pharmacology |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=1–14 |issn=1874-4672 |pmc=2749259 |pmid=19779578 |doi=10.2174/1874-470210902010001}}</ref>

==Classification==
NSAIDs can be classified based on their chemical structure or mechanism of action. Older NSAIDs were known long before their mechanism of action was elucidated and were for this reason classified by chemical structure or origin. Newer substances are more often classified by mechanism of action.

{{colend}}

===Chirality===

Most NSAIDs are [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] molecules ([[diclofenac]] is a notable exception). However, the majority are prepared in a [[racemic]] mixture. Typically, only a single [[enantiomer]] is pharmacologically active. For some drugs (typically profens), an [[isomerase]] [[enzyme]] ''in vivo'' converts the inactive enantiomer into the active form, although its activity varies widely in individuals. This phenomenon is likely responsible for the poor correlation between NSAID efficacy and plasma concentration observed in older studies, when specific analysis of the active enantiomer was not performed.

[[Ibuprofen]] and [[ketoprofen]] are now available in single, active enantiomer preparations (dexibuprofen and dexketoprofen), which purport to offer quicker onset and an improved side-effect profile. [[Naproxen]] has always been marketed as the single active enantiomer.

===Main practical differences===

NSAIDs within a group tend to have similar characteristics and tolerability. There is little difference in clinical efficacy among the NSAIDs when used at equivalent doses.<ref name=dean/> Rather, differences among compounds usually relate to dosing regimens (related to the compound's [[elimination half-life]]), route of administration, and tolerability profile.

Regarding adverse effects, selective [[COX-2 inhibitor]]s have lower risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, and there is no significant increase in risk of [[myocardial infarction]].<ref name=dean>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK45590/ |title=Comparing NSAIDs – PubMed Clinical Q&A |work=NCBI Bookshelf |publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine |author=Dean L |quote= Summaries of key questions from the Drug Effectiveness Review Project (DERP), Oregon Health & Science University }}</ref> With the exception of [[naproxen]], nonselective NSAIDs increase the risk of having a heart attack.<ref name=dean/> Some data also supports that the partially selective [[nabumetone]] is less likely to cause gastrointestinal events.<ref name=dean/>

A consumer report noted that [[ibuprofen]], naproxen, and [[salsalate]] are less expensive than other NSAIDs, and essentially as effective and safe when used appropriately to treat osteoarthritis and pain.<ref>[http://www.consumerreports.org/health/resources/pdf/best-buy-drugs/Nsaids2.pdf Treating Osteoarthritis and Pain: The Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Comparing Effectiveness, Safety, and Price]
Consumers Union 2005</ref>

==Pharmacokinetics==

Most nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are weak acids, with a pKa of 3–5. They are absorbed well from the [[stomach]] and intestinal mucosa. They are highly protein-bound in plasma (typically >95%), usually to [[human serum albumin|albumin]], so that their [[volume of distribution]] typically approximates to plasma volume. Most NSAIDs are metabolized in the [[liver]] by oxidation and conjugation to inactive metabolites that typically are excreted in the [[urine]], though some drugs are partially excreted in [[bile]]. Metabolism may be abnormal in certain disease states, and accumulation may occur even with normal dosage.

Ibuprofen and diclofenac have short half-lives (2–3 hours). Some NSAIDs (typically oxicams) have very long half-lives (e.g. 20–60 hours).

==History==
[[File:Bayer Aspirin ad, NYT, February 19, 1917.jpg|thumb|200px|right|One of the first advertisements for Bayer Aspirin, published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1917]]
From the era of Greek medicine to the mid-19th century, the discovery of medicinal agents was classed as an [[empirical evidence|empirical]] art; folklore and mythological guidance were combined in deploying the vegetable and mineral products that made up the expansive pharmacopeia of the time. [[Myrtus|Myrtle]] leaves were in use by 1500 BCE. Hippocrates (460–377 BCE) first reported using [[willow]] bark<ref name=organica>John McMurry.

Published by Cengage Learning Editores, 2005. {{ISBN|970-686-354-0}}</ref> and in 30 BCE [[Celsus]] described the signs of inflammation and also used willow bark to mitigate them.

==Veterinary use==

Research supports the use of NSAIDs for the control of pain associated with veterinary procedures such as dehorning and castration of calves. The best effect is obtained by combining a short-term local anesthetic such as [[lidocaine]] with an NSAID acting as a longer term analgesic. However, as different species have varying reactions to different medications in the NSAID family, little of the existing research data can be extrapolated to animal species other than those specifically studied, and the relevant government agency in one area sometimes prohibits uses approved in other jurisdictions.

For example, [[ketoprofen]]'s effects have been studied in horses more than in [[ruminants]] but, due to controversy over its use in racehorses, veterinarians who treat livestock in the United States more commonly prescribe [[flunixin meglumine]], which, while labeled for use in such animals, is not indicated for post-operative pain.

In the United States, [[meloxicam]] is approved for use only in canines, whereas (due to concerns about liver damage) it carries warnings against its use in cats<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/Products/ApprovedAnimalDrugProducts/FOIADrugSummaries/ucm118006.pdf |title=NADA 141–213: New Animal Drug Application Approval (for Metacam® (meloxicam) 0.5 mg/mL and 1.5 mg/mL Oral Suspension) |date=15 April 2003 |publisher=US Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=24 July 2010}}</ref><ref name="ProdInsert">Metacam [http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/Products/ApprovedAnimalDrugProducts/DrugLabels/UCM050394.pdf Client Information Sheet], product description: "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for oral use in dogs only", and in the "What Is Metacam" section in bold-face type: "Do not use in cats.", January 2005.</ref> except for one-time use during surgery.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/Products/ApprovedAnimalDrugProducts/FOIADrugSummaries/ucm118027.pdf Metacam 5 mg/mL Solution for Injection, Supplemental Approval] 28 October 2004.</ref>  In spite of these warnings, meloxicam is frequently prescribed "off-label" for non-canine animals including cats and livestock species.<ref>Off-label use discussed in: Arnold Plotnick MS, DVM, ACVIM, ABVP, [http://www.manhattancats.com/Articles/pain.html Pain Management using Metacam], and Stein, Robert, [http://www.vasg.org/perioperative_pain_management_part_iv.htm Perioperative Pain Management] Part IV, Looking Beyond Butorphanol, September 2006.</ref>  In other countries, for example The European Union (EU), there is a label claim for use in cats.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}
