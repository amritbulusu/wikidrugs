'''Plomestane''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]; former developmental code name '''MDL-18,962'''; also known as '''propargylestrenedione''', '''PED''', and '''10-propargylestr-4-ene-3,17-dione''') is a [[steroid]]al, [[irreversible inhibition|irreversible]] [[aromatase inhibitor]] which was under development by [[Marion Merrell Dow]]/[[Hoechst Marion Russell]] (now [[Hoechst AG]]) as an [[antineoplastic agent]] for the treatment of [[breast cancer]].<ref name="Macdonald1997">{{cite book | author = F.

In addition to its activity as an aromatase inhibitor, plomestane has weak [[androgen]]ic properties.<ref name="pmid9456245" />
