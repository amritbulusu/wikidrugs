==Use in the United Kingdom==
Naphyrone emerged as a new legal high in the United Kingdom only months after the ban of similar drug [[mephedrone]] (which was also a [[cathinone]] derivative). Until July 2010 the substance was not controlled by the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]] and was therefore not illegal for someone to possess. The Medicines Act prevented naphyrone from being sold for human consumption, and therefore it was sometimes sold as 'pond cleaner' or as another substance not normally consumed by humans. In response to this emerging trend of new [[designer drug]]s, Home Office Minister [[James Brokenshire]] said, "action to address the issue of emerging legal highs coming on to the market is a priority for the government."<ref>{{cite web|last=Francis |first=Nick |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/2984320/Next-meow-meow-to-hit-clubs-and-festivals.html |title=Next meow meow to hit clubs and festivals &#124; The Sun &#124;Features |publisher=The Sun |date=2010-05-24 |accessdate=2010-07-17}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2010}}

A study by researchers at Liverpool John Moores University found that only one out of ten products labelled as "NRG-1" actually contained naphyrone when they were subjected to laboratory analysis. Compounds found in products labelled NRG-1 included [[MDPV]], [[flephedrone]], [[mephedrone]], [[butylone]] and [[caffeine]], one product tested was [[inorganic]] in composition.<ref name=Confusing/>  In the case of an individual possessing a product labelled NRG-1 that contains MDPV or other illegal substances, they are in possession of a controlled substance.

On 12 July 2010, the [[Home Office]] announced that naphyrone had been banned and made a [[Class B drug]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/10602398.stm |title=NRG-1 'legal high' drug is banned |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-07-12 |accessdate=2010-07-17}}</ref> following a report from the [[Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/drugs/acmd1/naphyrone-report |title=Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs Naphyrone Report (2010) |publisher=Home Office |date=2010-07-07 |accessdate=2010-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717121420/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/drugs/acmd1/naphyrone-report |archivedate=2010-07-17 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2010/pdf/uksi_20101799_en.pdf |title=The Misuse of Drugs (Amendment No. 2) (England, Wales and Scotland) Regulations 2010 No. 1799 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-07-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2010/em/uksiem_20101799_en.pdf |title=Explanatory Memorandum To The Misuse of Drugs (Amendment No. 2) (England, Wales and Scotland) Regulations 2010 No. 1799 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-07-18}}</ref>

== Pharmacology ==
As a triple reuptake inhibitor, naphyrone has been shown ''[[in vitro]]'' to affect the [[reuptake]] of the [[neurotransmitter]]s [[serotonin]], [[dopamine]] and [[norepinephrine]] by interacting with the [[serotonin transporter]] (SERT), [[dopamine transporter]] (DAT), and [[norepinephrine transporter]] (NET).

One study found that the [[dissociation constant]] of naphyrone interacting with SERT is 33.1nM ± 1.1, with DAT is 20.1nM ± 7.1 and with NET is 136nM ± 27. The [[IC50|concentration of naphyrone required to inhibit the transporters by 50%]] is 46.0nM ± 5.5 for SERT, 40.0nM ± 13 for DAT and 11.7nM ± 0.9 for NET. Of a number of [[pyrovalerone]] analogues tested, naphyrone was found to be the only [[triple reuptake inhibitor]] found to be active at [[nano-|n]][[Molar concentration|M]] concentrations.<ref name="Meltzer" />

Some samples of β-naphyrone sold have also been found to contain the alternative [[isomer]] α-naphyrone,<ref>{{Cite journal
