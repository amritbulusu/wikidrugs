'''Ethinylestradiol''' ('''EE''') is an [[oral administration|orally active]] [[estrogen]] and a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]] [[derivative (chemistry)|derivative]] of [[estradiol]], a [[steroid hormone]] and the major [[endogenous]] estrogen in humans.<ref name="Elks2014" /> EE is used as a medication and is a component of almost all [[oral contraceptive formulations|formulation]]s of [[combined oral contraceptive]] (COC) pills, being nearly the exclusive estrogen used for this purpose.<ref name="pmid25841596">{{cite journal | pmid = 25841596 | doi=10.1016/j.mcna.2015.01.004 | volume=99 | title=Oral contraception | journal=Med Clin North Am | pages=479–503 | author=Evans G, Sutton EL}}</ref>{{outdated inline|date=October 2017}}

<!-- History and culture -->
EE was patented in 1935 and came into medical use in 1943.<ref name=Fis2006>{{cite book|last1=Fischer|first1=Janos|last2=Ganellin|first2=C.

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Medical uses==
Under the brand name Estinyl, EE was formerly used for [[hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] in [[menopause]] and the treatment of female [[hypogonadism]], loss of [[menstruation]], [[dysmenorrhea]], [[acne]], [[prostate cancer]], and [[breast cancer]].<ref>[http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic3/estinyl_ids.htm RxList.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060110152353/http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic3/estinyl_ids.htm |date=2006-01-10 }} - Estinyl (ethynyl estradiol)</ref> However, in more recent times, EE is mainly used in COCs. In contraception, due to concerns of unopposed estrogen action and the possible increased risk of [[endometrial cancer]] that accompanies this, EE is formulated in combination with [[progestin]]s. EE is little used in menopausal hormone replacement therapy.<ref name="OettelSchillinger2012" />

EE has been used at very high dosages (1–2&nbsp;mg/day) in the treatment of prostate cancer.<ref name="SatoskarRege1973">{{cite book|author1=R. S. Satoskar|author2=S. D. Bhandarkar &nirmala N. Rege|title=Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapeutics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7d493VOD4P8C&pg=PA934|year=1973|publisher=Popular Prakashan|isbn=978-81-7991-527-1|pages=934–}}</ref>

==Contraindications==
EE should be avoided in women with a history of or known susceptibility to [[thrombosis]] ([[blood clot]]s), particularly [[venous thromboembolism]] (VTE).

Due to risk of [[cholestatic hepatotoxicity]], it is widely considered that COCs containing EE should be avoided in women with a history of [[cholestasis of pregnancy]], [[hepatic tumor]]s, active [[hepatitis]], and familial defects in biliary excretion.<ref name="Aronson2009" />

==Side effects==
Side effects of EE are the same as for other estrogens and include [[breast tenderness]], [[headache]], [[water retention (medicine)|fluid retention]] ([[bloating]]), [[nausea]], [[dizziness]], and [[weight gain]].<ref name="pmid23375353" /><ref name="Aronson2009" /> The estrogen component of oral contraceptives, which is almost always EE, can cause [[breast tenderness]] and [[breast enlargement|fullness]].<ref name="Becker2001" />

===Rare reactions===

====Venous thromboembolism====
EE carries a greater risk of blood clot formation and VTE than does natural estradiol, which is thought to be due to different degrees of hepatic metabolism between the two drugs (see [[#Potency|below]]).

The original formulations of COCs contained as much as 150&nbsp;μg EE.<ref name="FalconeHurd2007" /> However, it was soon found that EE is associated with incidence of VTE and that the risk is dose-dependent.<ref name="FalconeHurd2007" /> Subsequently, the dosage of EE was greatly reduced, and is now generally between 25 and 35&nbsp;μg,<ref name="FalconeHurd2007" /> in some cases less than 20&nbsp;μg,<ref name="FalconeHurd2007" /> and not more than 50&nbsp;μg.<ref name="BreastCancer1991">{{cite book|author=Committee on the Relationship Between Oral Contraceptives and BreastCancer|title=Oral Contraceptives and Breast Cancer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=upYrAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA143|date=1 January 1991|publisher=National Academies|pages=143–|id=NAP:13774|quote=Following a recommendation by its Fertility and Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently ordered the removal from the market of all oral contraceptives with [ethinylestradiol] contents greater than 50 μg.}}</ref><ref name="DIANE">{{cite book|title=Multigenerational Reproductive Toxicology Study of Ethinyl Estradiol (CAS No. 57636) in SpragueDawley Rats (Feed Studies)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wAnRHsPQcBQC&pg=PA27|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-1-4379-4231-6|pages=27–|quote=Oral contraceptive formulations containing greater than 50 ug ethinyl estradiol were removed from the United States market in 1989, and currently marketed formulations generally contain between 20 and 35 μg ethinyl estradiol.}}</ref><ref name="Becker2001">{{cite book|author=Kenneth L.

COCs containing ≥50 μg of estrogen should no longer be routinely used for contraception. [...] The estrogen component of COCs can cause breast fullness and tenderness.}}</ref> These lower dosages have a significantly reduced risk of VTE with no loss of contraceptive effectiveness.<ref name="FalconeHurd2007" /> According to a bulletin posted by the {{abbrlink|U.S.|United States}} {{abbrlink|FDA|Food and Drug Administration}}, the rate of [[deep vein thrombosis]] in women taking COCs containing 20 to 40&nbsp;μg EE is 4 per 10,000, which is approximately equivalent to the rate of 3 per 10,000 in women not taking a COC.<ref name="WallaceHahn2007">{{cite book|author1=Daniel Jeffrey Wallace|author2=Bevra Hahn|title=Dubois' Lupus Erythematosus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tj9JR3IITy8C&pg=PA1252|year=2007|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-9394-0|pages=1252–}}</ref> No study has shown a further reduced risk of VTE below an EE dosage of 30 or 35&nbsp;μg.<ref name="FalconeHurd2007" />

====Cholestatic hepatotoxicity====
EE has, albeit rarely (at the low dosages that are now used in COCs), been associated with [[cholestasis|cholestatic]] [[hepatotoxicity]] similarly to [[17α-alkylated anabolic steroid|17α-alkylated]] [[anabolic-androgenic steroid]]s and 17α-ethynylated [[19-nortestosterone]] progestins.<ref name="TraunerJansen2004">{{cite book|author1=Michael Trauner|author2=Peter L.

Aronson|title=Meyler's Side Effects of Endocrine and Metabolic Drugs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BWMeSwVwfTkC&pg=PA177|date=21 February 2009|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-093292-7|pages=177, 219, 223, 224, 230, 232, 239, 242}}</ref>

====Endometrial cancer====
The high doses of EE that were used in early COCs were associated with a significantly increased risk of [[endometrial cancer]] in certain preparations, for instance those containing the progestogen [[dimethisterone]].<ref name="Blaustein2013">{{cite book|author=A. Blaustein|title=Pathology of the Female Genital Tract|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4MXSBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA291|date=11 November 2013|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4757-1767-9|pages=291–}}</ref> Unopposed estrogens like EE have carcinogenic effects in the endometrium and progestogens protect against these effects, but dimethisterone is a relatively weak progestogen and was unable to adequately antagonize the endometrial carcinogenic effects of EE, in turn resulting in the increased risk of endometrial cancer.<ref name="Blaustein2013" /> COCs containing dimethisterone have since been discontinued (with more potent progestogens used instead) and doses of EE in COCs in general have been dramatically reduced, abrogating the risk.<ref name="Blaustein2013" /> In turn, most studies of modern COCs have found a decreased risk of endometrial cancer.<ref name="SurwitAlberts2012">{{cite book|author1=Earl A. Surwit|author2=David Alberts|title=Endometrial Cancer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jbshBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA11|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4613-0867-6|pages=11–}}</ref>

==Interactions==
[[Enzyme inducer|Inducer]]s of certain [[cytochrome P450]] enzymes such as [[CYP3A4]] can decrease circulating concentrations of EE.<ref name="Aronson2009" /> Examples include [[anticonvulsant]]s like [[phenytoin]], [[primidone]], [[ethosuximide]], [[phenobarbital]], and [[carbamazepine]], [[azole]] [[antifungal]]s like [[fluconazole]], and [[rifamycin]] [[antibiotic]]s like [[rifampin]] ([[rifampicin]]).<ref name="Aronson2009" /> Conversely, inhibitors of CYP3A4 and certain other cytochrome P450 enzymes may increase circulating levels of EE.<ref name="Aronson2009" /> An example is [[troleandomycin]], which is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of CYP3A4.<ref name="Aronson2009" />

[[Paracetamol]] has been found to [[competitive inhibition|competitively inhibit]] the sulfation of EE, with pretreatment of 1&nbsp;g paracetamol significantly increasing the [[area-under-curve (pharmacokinetics)|AUC]] levels of EE (by 22%) and decreasing the AUC levels of EE sulfate in women.<ref name="Aronson2009" /> The same has been found for [[ascorbic acid]] (vitamin C) and EE, although the significance of the interaction has been regarded as dubious.<ref name="Aronson2009" />

Unlike the case of estradiol, there is probably no pharmacokinetic interaction between [[smoking]] (which potently induces certain [[cytochrome P450]] [[enzyme]]s and markedly increases the 2-hydroxylation of estradiol) and EE.<ref name="Aronson2009" /> This suggests that estradiol and EE are metabolized by different cytochrome P450 enzymes.<ref name="Aronson2009" /> There is however still an increased risk of cardiovascular complications with smoking and EE, similarly to the case of smoking and other estrogens.<ref name="Aronson2009" />

The 19-nortestosterone progestins, [[gestodene]] and, to a lesser extent, [[desogestrel]], have been found to inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes and to progressively inhibit the metabolism and increase the concentrations of EE.<ref name="Aronson2009" />

EE has been found to significantly increase (by 38%) the AUC of [[omeprazole]] (which is metabolized by [[CYP2C19]]).<ref name="Aronson2009" />

==Pharmacology==
EE is an [[estrogen]] similarly to natural estrogens like estradiol and [[conjugated equine estrogen]]s and synthetic estrogens like [[diethylstilbestrol]]. It binds to and activates both [[isoform]]s of the [[estrogen receptor]], [[Estrogen receptor alpha|ERα]] and [[Estrogen receptor beta|ERβ]].<ref name="OettelSchillinger2012">{{cite book|author1=Michael Oettel|author2=Ekkehard Schillinger|title=Estrogens and Antiestrogens II: Pharmacology and Clinical Application of Estrogens and Antiestrogen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wBvyCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA369|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-60107-1|pages=248, 369|quote=The binding affinity of EE2 for the estrogen receptor is similar to that of estradiol.

As can be seen in the table below, EE shows strong and disproportionate effects on [[Liver#Synthesis|hepatic protein production]] relative to estradiol.<ref name="pmid16112947" /> The [[liver]] as well as the [[uterus]] express [[17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]] (17β-HSD), and this [[enzyme]] serves to inactivate estradiol and effectively suppress its potency in these tissues (analogously but in the opposite manner to potentiation of [[testosterone]] by [[5α-reductase]] into the more potent [[dihydrotestosterone]] in so-called [[androgen]]ic tissues like the [[skin]], [[hair follicle]]s, and [[prostate gland]])<ref name="IIIBarbieri2013">{{cite book|author1=Jerome F. Strauss, III|author2=Robert L.

On the other hand, due to the loss of inactivation of EE by 17β-HSD in the [[endometrium]] (uterus), EE is relatively more active than estradiol in the endometrium and, for this reason, is associated with a significantly lower incidence of [[vaginal bleeding|vaginal bleeding and spotting]] in comparison.<ref name="pmid16112947" /> This is particularly so in the case of combined estrogen and progestogen therapy (as in COCs or menopausal HRT), as progestogens induce the expression of 17β-HSD in the endometrium.<ref name="pmid16112947" /> The reduced vaginal bleeding and spotting with EE is one of the main reasons that it is used in COCs instead of estradiol,<ref name="pmid22468839" /> in spite of its potentially inferior safety profile (related to its adverse effects on hepatic protein synthesis and VTE incidence).<ref name="pmid21538049">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sitruk-Ware R, Nath A | title = Metabolic effects of contraceptive steroids | journal = Rev Endocr Metab Disord | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 63–75 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21538049 | doi = 10.1007/s11154-011-9182-4 | url = }}</ref>

EE has been found to have similar effects on hepatic protein production and VTE risk regardless of whether the [[route of administration]] is oral, transdermal, or vaginal, indicating that oral versus non-oral routes do not reduce the hepatic actions of EE relative to non-hepatic actions.<ref name="Lobo2007" /> In contrast, at typical menopausal dosages, whereas oral estradiol shows significant effects on hepatic protein production, transdermal estradiol shows little or no such effects.<ref name="pmid16112947" />

==Pharmacokinetics==

===Absorption===
The [[oral administration|oral]] [[bioavailability]] of EE is between 38 and 48%, with a wide range of 20% to 65% (mean 45%) that is due to high [[interindividual variability]].<ref name="pmid23375353" /> Although relatively low, the oral bioavailability of EE is considerably higher than that of estradiol (5%).<ref name="pmid2256522" /><ref name="pmid23375353" /> Following a single 20&nbsp;μg dose of EE in combination with 1&nbsp;mg [[norethisterone]] in postmenopausal women, EE concentrations have been found to reach a maximum of 50&nbsp;pg/mL within an average of 1.5&nbsp;hours.<ref name="pmid16112947">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuhl H | title = Pharmacology of estrogens and progestogens: influence of different routes of administration | journal = Climacteric | volume = 8 Suppl 1 | issue = | pages = 3–63 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16112947 | doi = 10.1080/13697130500148875 | url = }}</ref> Following the first dose, mean levels of EE in general further increase by about 50% until [[steady-state concentration]]s are reached;<ref name="pmid16112947" /> steady-state is reached after one week of daily administration.<ref name="OettelSchillinger2012" /> For comparison, the mean peak levels of estradiol achieved with 2&nbsp;mg micronized estradiol or [[estradiol valerate]] are 40&nbsp;pg/mL following the first dose and 80&nbsp;pg/mL after three weeks of administration.<ref name="pmid16112947" /> These concentrations of estradiol are in the same range as the concentrations of EE that are produced by an oral dose of EE that is 100 times lower by weight, which is in accordance with the approximately 100-fold increased oral potency of EE relative to estradiol.<ref name="GomelMunro1990" /><ref name="pmid16112947" /> In accordance with the high interindividual variability in the oral bioavailability of EE, there is a large degree of interindividual variation in EE levels.<ref name="pmid16112947" />

===Distribution===
Unlike estradiol, which binds with high affinity to [[sex hormone-binding globulin]] (SHBG), EE has no affinity for this protein and is instead bound almost exclusively to [[human serum albumin|albumin]] (97–98%).<ref name="(Firm)Inc2005" /><ref name="pmid16112947" /><ref name="pmid23375353">{{cite journal | vauthors = Stanczyk FZ, Archer DF, Bhavnani BR | title = Ethinyl estradiol and 17β-estradiol in combined oral contraceptives: pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and risk assessment | journal = Contraception | volume = 87 | issue = 6 | pages = 706–27 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23375353 | doi = 10.1016/j.contraception.2012.12.011 | url = }}</ref><ref name="NotelovitzKeep2012">{{cite book|author1=M.

===Metabolism===
Due to high first-pass metabolism in the [[intestine]]s and [[liver]], only 1% of an oral dose of an EE appears in the circulation as EE itself.<ref name="pmid16112947" /> During first-pass metabolism, EE is extensively [[conjugation (pharmacokinetics)|conjugated]] via [[sulfation]] into the hormonally inert EE sulfate, and levels of EE sulfate in circulation are between 6- and 22-fold higher than those of EE.<ref name="pmid16112947" /> For comparison, with oral administration of 2&nbsp;mg micronized estradiol, levels of [[estrone]] and [[estrone sulfate]] are 4- to 6-fold and 200-fold higher than those of estradiol, respectively.<ref name="pmid16112947" /> In contrast to estradiol, EE, due to [[steric hindrance]] by its C17α ethynyl group, is not metabolized or inactivated by 17β-HSD,<ref name="Shellenberger1986" /> and this is the primary factor responsible for the dramatically increased potency of oral EE relative to oral estradiol.<ref name="pmid16112947" /> Due to the formation of EE sulfate, [[enterohepatic circulation]] is involved in the [[pharmacokinetics]] of EE similarly to estradiol, although to a lesser extent.<ref name="pmid16112947" />

Aside from sulfate conjugation, EE is mainly [[metabolism|metabolized]] by [[hydroxylation]] into [[catechol estrogen]]s.<ref name="pmid16112947" /> This is mainly by 2-hydroxylation into 2-hydroxy-EE, which is catalyzed primarily by [[CYP3A4]].<ref name="pmid23375353" /> Hydroxylation of EE at the C4, C6α, and C16β positions into 4-, 6α-, and 16β-hydroxy-EE has also been reported, but appears to contribute to its metabolism to only a small extent.<ref name="pmid23375353" /> 2- and 4-methoxy-EE are also formed via transformation by [[catechol O-methyltransferase]] of 2- and 4-hydroxy-EE.<ref name="pmid16112947" /> Unlike the case of estradiol, 16α-hydroxylation does not occur with EE, owing to [[steric hindrance]] by its ethynyl group at C17α.<ref name="pmid23375353" /><ref name="pmid16112947" /> The ethynylation of EE is largely irreversible, and so EE is not metabolized into estradiol, unlike [[estradiol ester]]s.<ref name="pmid16112947" /> A review found that the range of the reported [[terminal half-life]] of EE in the literature was 13.1 to 27.0 hours.<ref name="pmid2256522">{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldzieher JW, Brody SA | title = Pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and mestranol | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 163 | issue = 6 Pt 2 | pages = 2114–9 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2256522 | doi = | url = }}</ref> Another review reported a terminal half-life of EE of 10–20 hours.<ref name="pmid23375353" /> However, the terminal half-life of EE has also been reported by other sources to be as short as 7 hours<ref name="Shellenberger1986" /> and as long as 36 hours.<ref name="HughesWaters2016" />

Unlike the case of estradiol, in which there is a rapid rise in its levels and which remain elevated in a plateau-like curve for many hours, levels of EE fall rapidly after peaking.<ref name="pmid16112947" /> This is thought to be because estrone and estrone sulfate can be reversibly converted back into estradiol and serve as a hormonally inert reservoir for estradiol, whereas the EE sulfate reservoir for EE is much smaller in comparison.<ref name="pmid16112947" />

EE, following [[oxidation|oxidative]] formation of a very reactive [[metabolite]], [[irreversible inhibition|irreversibly inhibit]]s [[cytochrome P450]] [[enzyme]]s involved in its metabolism, and this may also play a role in the increased potency of EE relative to estradiol.<ref name="pmid16112947" /> Indeed, EE is said to have a marked effect on hepatic metabolism, and this is one of the reasons, among others, that natural estrogens like estradiol may be preferable.<ref name="NotelovitzKeep2012" />

===Elimination===
EE is [[elimination (pharmacokinetics)|eliminated]] 62% in the [[feces]] and 38% in the [[urine]].<ref name="pmid23375353" />

==Chemistry==
EE is an [[estrane]] [[steroid]] and a derivative of [[estradiol]] with an [[ethynyl group|ethynyl substitution]] at the C17α position. It is also known as '''17α-ethynylestradiol''' or as '''17α-ethynylestra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17β-diol'''. The 17α-ethynylation of EE is analogous to the 17α-substitution of [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]] derivatives such as 17α-ethynylated progestins like [[ethisterone]] (17α-ethynyltestosterone) and [[norethisterone]] (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) and 17α-alkylated anabolic-androgenic steroids like [[methyltestosterone]] (17α-methyltestosterone).

===Derivatives===
A number of [[chemical derivative|derivative]]s of EE exist. These include [[mestranol]] (EE 3-methyl ether), [[quinestrol]] (EE 3-cyclopentyl ether), [[ethinylestradiol sulfonate]] (EE 3-isopropylsulfonate), and [[moxestrol]] (11β-methoxy-EE). The former three are [[prodrug]]s of EE, while the latter is not.

===Analogues===
A few 17α-substituted [[structural analog|analogue]]s of EE exist. Examples include [[methylestradiol]], [[ethinylestriol]], and [[nilestriol]] (ethinylestriol 3-cyclopentyl ether).

==History==
EE was the first orally active synthetic estrogen and was described in 1938 by Hans Herloff Inhoffen and Walter Hohlweg of [[Schering AG]] in [[Berlin]].<ref name="Inhoffen 1938">{{Cite journal | last1 = Inhoffen | first1 = H.
