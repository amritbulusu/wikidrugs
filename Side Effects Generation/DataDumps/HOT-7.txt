'''HOT-7''', or '''2,5-dimethoxy-4-(β-propylthio)-N-hydroxyphenethylamine''', is a [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] [[phenethylamine]] of the [[2C's|2C family]].  It was presumably first synthesized by [[Alexander Shulgin]] and reported in his book, ''[[PiHKAL|PiHKAL (Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved)]]''.

==Chemistry==

HOT-7's full chemical name is 2-[4-(2-[[propyl]][[Thio-|thio]])-2,5-di[[methoxy]][[phenyl]]&ndash;[[Nitrogen|N]]&ndash;[[hydroxyl|hydroxyethanamine]].  It has [[structure|structural]] properties similar to [[2C-T-7]] and to other drugs in the HOT- series, with the most closely related compounds being [[HOT-2]] and [[HOT-17]].

==General information==

The dosage range of HOT-7 is typically 15-25 [[milligram|mg]] and its duration is approximately 6–8 hours according to Shulgin.  HOT-7 produces closed-eye and open-eye visuals.  It also induces a feeling similar to that of being [[drunk]].
