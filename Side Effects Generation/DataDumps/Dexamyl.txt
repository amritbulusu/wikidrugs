'''Dexamyl''' (or '''Drinamyl''' in the UK) is the brand name of a combination drug composed of [[amobarbital]] (previously called amylbarbitone) and [[dextroamphetamine]].<ref>''The Primrose To Drug'', [[Charleston, West Virginia]] Sunday Gazette-Mail, March 28,
1965, Page 54.</ref>

First introduced in 1950 by Smith, Kline and French, Dexamyl was marketed as an [[antidepressant]] medication that did not cause agitation, and also as an anti-anxiety drug and diet drug.  Amphetamine alone had previously been marketed as an antidepressant (under the Benzedrine Sulfate brand) beginning around 1938. The amphetamine in Dexamyl was intended to elevate mood, while the [[barbiturate]] was added to counter the side effects of the amphetamine. Its name is a [[portmanteau]] of ''dex''troamphetamine and ''amyl''barbitone.

Dexamyl was discontinued in the 1970s in favor of [[MAO inhibitors]] and [[tricyclic antidepressants]].

==History==
The British Prime Minister [[Anthony Eden]] was prescribed Dexamyl; he was using it to treat abdominal pain. It has been suggested that the drug impaired his judgement during the [[Suez crisis]].{{Citation needed|reason=According to Whom?|date=October 2016}} The failure of his Suez policies led to his ousting while he was recovering in [[Jamaica]].

In Britain during the early 1960s, the drug was taken by "tired housewives", and was also abused by youths who took excessively large doses and nicknamed the triangular blue tablets "purple hearts". This became a celebrated part of the [[Mod (subculture)|Mod]] subculture. The main character of the film of ''[[Quadrophenia (film)|Quadrophenia]]'' by [[The Who]] is shown taking purple hearts at a party, then subsequently appearing to suffer an attack of amphetamine psychosis.<ref>[[Nicolas Rasmussen|Rasmussen, Nicolas]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=1mf5eEG0nRUC&pg=PA173&dq=Dexamyl+%22purple+heart%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=cnY_UeOuK8SMOL_UgcAF&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Dexamyl%20%22purple%20heart%22&f=false ''On speed : the many lives of amphetamine'', New York University Press, (New York), 2008, pp.172–173.]</ref>

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Dexamyl spansules—a clear and green capsule containing green and white "beads"—became popular as a street-drug upper nicknamed "Christmas trees," a reference to its appearance.

The [[Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs]] and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] decided to recall all diet drugs that contained amphetamines and required all of them to be off the market by June 30, 1973. [[Smith, Kline & French]], the producer of Dexamyl and [[Eskatrol]], was excepted from an order banning interstate shipment of its drugs. The
company asked for a hearing before the F.D.A.<ref>''U.S. Sets Diet Drug Recall In Drive on Amphetamines'', [[New York Times]], April 2,
1973, Page 73.</ref>

In his autobiography ''My Life of Absurdity'', [[Chester Himes]] writes of his use of Dexamyl in the mid-1950s. He also writes that he stopped taking the pill after his friend Vandi Haygood died from "steady doses of Dexamyl."<ref>{{cite book|title=My Life of Absurdity: The Autobiography of Chester Himes Volume II|date=1976|publisher=Doubleday & Company|year=|isbn=|location=Garden City, New York,|pages=19|quote=|via=|last1=Himes|first1=Chester|accessdate=9 November 2016}}</ref>

Dr. [[George C. Nichopoulos]] was indicted in May 1980 for having improperly prescribed Dexamyl and [[Preludin]] to the singer [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], despite knowing he was addicted to them.<ref>''Presley Doctor Indicted on Drugs'', New York Times, May 17, 1980, Page 8.</ref>
Dr. Patrick A. Mazza, [[team physician]] for the [[Reading Phillies]], said he prescribed Dexamyl, Eskatrol, [[Dexedrine]], and Preludin for [[Steve Carlton]], [[Larry Christenson]], [[Tim McCarver]], [[Pete Rose]], [[Larry Bowa]], and [[Greg Luzinski]]. The charges against Mazza were dropped after he contended that he had provided the prescriptions in good faith to the baseball players at their request.<ref>''Charges Dismissed In Phils' Drug Case'', New York Times, February 5, 1981, Page B7.</ref> The pill was noted writer [[Terry Southern]]'s drug of choice for many years.<ref>http://www.oxfordamerican.org/item/784-nights-of-terror-days-of-weird</ref>
