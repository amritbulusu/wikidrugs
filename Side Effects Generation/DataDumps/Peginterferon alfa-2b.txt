==Medical uses==

For hepatitis C it may also be used with [[boceprevir]], [[telaprevir]], [[simeprevir]], or [[sofosbuvir]].<ref name=UW2017/>

=== Host genetic factors===

For genotype 1 hepatitis C treated with [[Peginterferon alfa-2a|pegylated interferon-alfa-2a]] or pegylated interferon-alfa-2b combined with [[ribavirin]], it has been shown that genetic polymorphisms near the human IL28B gene, encoding interferon lambda 3, are associated with significant differences in response to the treatment.  This finding, originally reported in Nature,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Genetic variation in IL28B predicts hepatitis C treatment-induced viral clearance |vauthors=Ge D, Fellay J, Thompson AJ, etal |journal=Nature |year=2009 |volume=461|pages=399–401 |pmid=19684573 |doi=10.1038/nature08309|issue=7262}}</ref> showed that genotype 1 hepatitis C patients carrying certain genetic variant alleles near the IL28B gene are more likely to achieve sustained virological response after the treatment than others.  A later report from Nature<ref>{{cite journal|title=Genetic variation in IL28B and spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus |vauthors=Thomas DL, Thio CL, Martin MP, etal |journal=Nature |year=2009  |pmid=19759533 |doi=10.1038/nature08463|volume=461|issue=7265|pages=798–801 |pmc=3172006}}</ref> demonstrated that the same genetic variants are also associated with the natural clearance of the genotype 1 hepatitis C virus.

==Side effects==
Common side effects include headache, feeling tired, mood changes, trouble sleeping, hair loss, nausea, pain at the site of injection, and fever.<!-- <ref name=Pro2017/> --> Severe side effects may include [[psychosis]], [[liver problems]], [[blood clots]], [[infections]], or an [[irregular heartbeat]].<ref name=Pro2017/> Use with ribavirin is not recommended during [[pregnancy]].<ref name=Pro2017/>

==Mechanism of action==
One of the major mechanisms of PEG-interferon alpha-2b utilizes the [[JAK-STAT]] signaling pathway. The basic mechanism works such that PEG-interferon alpha-2b will bind to its receptor, interferon-alpha receptor 1 and 2 (IFNAR1/2). Upon ligand binding the Tyk2 protein associated with [[IFNAR1]] is [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] which in turn phosphorylates Jak1 associated with IFNAR2. This kinase continues its signal transduction by phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 and 2 via Jak 1 and Tyk2 respectively. The phosphorylated STATs then dissociate from the receptor heterodimer and form an interferon transcription factor with p48 and IRF9 to form the interferon stimulate transcription factor-3  (ISGF3). This transcription factor then translocates to the nucleus where it will transcribe several genes involved in cell cycle control, cell differentiation, [[apoptosis]], and immune response.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ward AC, Touw I, Yoshimura A |title=The Jak-Stat pathway in normal and perturbed hematopoiesis |journal=Blood |volume=95 |issue=1 |pages=19–29 |date=January 2000 |pmid=10607680 |url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10607680}}</ref><ref>[http://www.networksandpathways.org/pathway?name=IFNalpha&description=IFN%20alpha PATHWAYS :: IFN alpha<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
   
PEG-interferon alpha-2b acts as a multifunctional immunoregulatory cytokine by transcribing several genes, including [[interleukin 4]] (IL4). This cytokine is responsible for inducing T helper cells to become type 2 helper [[T cells]]. This ultimately results in the stimulation of B cells to proliferate and increase their antibody production. This ultimately allows for an immune response, as the [[B cells]] will help to signal the immune system that a foreign antigen is present.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Thomas H, Foster G, Platis D |title=Corrigendum to ‘‘Mechanisms of action of interferon and nucleoside analogues’’ J Hepatol 39 (2003) S93–8 |journal=J Hepatol |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=364 |date=February 2004 |doi=10.1016/j.jhep.2003.12.003 |url=http://www.journal-of-hepatology.eu/article/S0168-8278(03)00640-8/fulltext}}</ref>

Another major mechanism of type I interferon alpha (IFNα) is to stimulate [[apoptosis]] in malignant cell lines. Previous studies have shown that IFNα can cause cell cycle arrest in U266, Daudi, and Rhek-1 cell lines.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sangfelt O, Erickson S, Castro J, Heiden T, Einhorn S, Grandér D |title=Induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cell growth are independent responses to interferon-alpha in hematopoietic cell lines |journal=Cell Growth Differ. |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=343–52 |date=March 1997 |pmid=9056677 |url=http://cgd.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/8/3/343 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426201616/http://cgd.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/8/3/343 |archivedate=2014-04-26 |df= }}</ref>
      
A follow-up study researched to determine if the [[caspases]] were involved in the apoptosis seen in the previous study as well as to determine the role of mitochondrial cytochrome c release. The study confirmed that there was cleavage of caspase-3, -8, and -9. All three of these cysteine proteases play an important role in the initiation and activation of the apoptotic cascade. Furthermore, it was shown that IFNα induced a loss in the mitochondrial membrane potential which resulted in the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. Follow-up research is currently being conducted to determine the upstream activators of the apoptotic pathway that are induced by IFNα.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Thyrell L, Erickson S, Zhivotovsky B, etal |title=Mechanisms of Interferon-alpha induced apoptosis in malignant cells |journal=Oncogene |volume=21 |issue=8 |pages=1251–62 |date=February 2002 |pmid=11850845 |doi=10.1038/sj.onc.1205179 }}</ref>

==History==
It was developed by Schering-Plough. [[Merck & Co.|Merck]] studied it for melanoma under the [[brand]] name Sylatron. It was approved for this use in April 2011.
