'''Paliperidone''', sold under the trade name '''Invega''' among others, is a [[dopamine antagonist]] and [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub> antagonist]] of the  [[atypical antipsychotic]] class of medications. It is marketed by [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]]. Invega is an extended release formulation of paliperidone that uses the [[OROS]] extended release system to allow for once-daily dosing.

'''Paliperidone palmitate''' is a long-acting injectable formulation of paliperidone [[palmitic acid|palmitoyl]] [[ester]] indicated for once-every 28 days injection after an initial titration period.  Paliperidone is used to treat mania and at lower doses as maintenance for [[bipolar disorder]]. It is also indicated in the US by the FDA for [[schizophrenia]] and [[schizoaffective disorder]].

==Medical use==
It is used for the treatment of schizophrenia and [[schizoaffective disorder]]. In a 2013 study in a comparison of 15 antipsychotic drugs in effectiveness in treating schizophrenic symptoms, paliperidone was ranked fifth, demonstrating standard-high effectiveness. 10-14% more effective than [[haloperidol]], [[quetiapine]], and [[aripiprazole]], 11% less effective than [[risperidone]] (4th), and 43% less effective than [[clozapine]] (1st).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Leucht|first1=Stefan|last2=Cipriani|first2=Andrea|last3=Spineli|first3=Loukia|last4=Mavridis|first4=Dimitris|last5=Örey|first5=Deniz|last6=Richter|first6=Franziska|last7=Samara|first7=Myrto|last8=Barbui|first8=Corrado|last9=Engel|first9=Rolf R|last10=Geddes|first10=John R|last11=Kissling|first11=Werner|last12=Stapf|first12=Marko Paul|last13=Lässig|first13=Bettina|last14=Salanti|first14=Georgia|last15=Davis|first15=John M|title=Comparative efficacy and tolerability of 15 antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia: a multiple-treatments meta-analysis|journal=The Lancet|date=September 2013|volume=382|issue=9896|pages=951–962|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60733-3}}</ref>

|When flexibly dosed every four weeks, paliperidone palmitate appears comparable in [[Efficacy|efficacy]] and tolerability to risperidone. In short-term studies, paliperidone palmitate - the longer-acting injection - has a similar adverse effect profile to related compounds such as risperidone by mouth. No difference was found in the high rate of reported adverse sexual outcomes and paliperidone palmitate is associated with an increase in serum prolactin. <ref name=Nus2012/>

==Pharmacology==
Paliperidone is the primary active metabolite of the older antipsychotic [[risperidone]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01267|title=The DrugBank database}}</ref>  While its specific mechanism of action is unknown, it is believed paliperidone and risperidone act via similar, if not identical, pathways.

Paliperidone has antagonist effect at α<sub>1</sub> and α<sub>2</sub> [[adrenergic receptor]]s and at [[Histamine H1 receptor|H<sub>1</sub> histamine receptors]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prescribingreference.com/products/showProducts/which/Invega|title=Prescribing Reference: New Product Releases - INVEGA|accessdate=2008-05-25}}</ref> It does not bind to [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor]]s. In addition, it blocks dopamine and serotonin receptors.

Paliperidone has less affinity for [[D4 receptor]]s than risperidone.<ref>http://pdsp.med.unc.edu/pdsp.php?knowID=&kiKey=&receptorDD=&receptor=&speciesDD=&species=&sourcesDD=&source=&hotLigandDD=&hotLigand=&testDDRadio=testDDRadio&testLigandDD=2327&testLigand=&referenceDD=&reference=&KiGreater=&KiLess=&kiAllRadio=all&doQuery=Submit+Query{{full}}</ref><ref>http://pdsp.med.unc.edu/pdsp.php?knowID=&kiKey=&receptorDD=&receptor=&speciesDD=&species=&sourcesDD=&source=&hotLigandDD=&hotLigand=&testDDRadio=testDDRadio&testLigandDD=2328&testLigand=&referenceDD=&reference=&KiGreater=&KiLess=&kiAllRadio=all&doQuery=Submit+Query{{full}}</ref>

Food increases the absorption of Invega type ER OROS prolonged-release tablet. Food increased exposure of Paliperidone by up to 50-60%, however, half-life was not significantly affected. The effect was probably due to a delay in the transit of the ER OROS formulation in the upper part of the GI channel, resulting in increased absorption (uptake).<ref name=EMA-InvegaOriginalSA>{{cite web|title=Paliperidone extended release: Scientific Discussion|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Scientific_Discussion/human/000746/WC500034928.pdf|publisher=EMA|date=16 July 2007}} Linked from [http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/000746/human_med_000848.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d124 EMA main page on drug], in "Assessment History" tab.</ref>

==History==
Paliperidone (as Invega) was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for the treatment of [[schizophrenia]] in 2006.  Paliperidone was approved by the FDA for the treatment of schizoaffective disorder in 2009. The long-acting injectable form of paliperidone, marketed as Invega Sustenna in U.S. and Xeplion in Europe, was approved by the FDA on July 31, 2009. It is the only available brand in Bangladesh under the brand name "Palimax ER" manufactured & marketed by ACI Pharmaceuticals. 

It was initially approved in Europe in 2007 for schizophrenia, the extended release form and use for schizoaffective disorder were approved in Europe in 2010, and extension to use in adolescents older than 15 years old was approved in 2014.<ref name=EMAhistory>{{cite web|title=Procedural steps taken and scientific information after the authorisation|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Procedural_steps_taken_and_scientific_information_after_authorisation/human/000746/WC500034930.pdf|publisher=EMA|date=16 July 2015}} Linked from [http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/000746/human_med_000848.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d124 EMA main page on drug], in "Assessment History" tab.</ref>
