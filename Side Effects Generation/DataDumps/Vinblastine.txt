Vinblastine is reported to be an effective component of certain chemotherapy regimens, particularly when used with bleomycin, and methotrexate in VBM chemotherapy for Stage IA or IIA Hodgkin lymphomas.
The inclusion of vinblastine allows for lower doses of bleomycin and reduced overall toxicity with larger resting periods between chemotherapy cycles.<ref>{{cite journal|last1 = Gobbi|first1 = Paolo G.|last2 = Broglia|first2 = Chiara|last3 = Merli|first3 = Francesco|last4 = Dell'Olio|first4 = Matteo|last5 = Stelitano|first5 = Caterina|last6 = Iannitto|first6 = Emilio|last7 = Federico|first7 = Massimo|last8 = Berté|first8 = Raffaella|last9 = Luisi|first9 = Dimitri|last10 = Molica|first10 = Stefano|last11 = Cavalli|first11 = Carla|last12 = Dezza|first12 = Laura|last13 = Ascari|first13 = Edoardo|title = Vinblastine, Bleomycin, and Methotrexate Chemotherapy plus Irradiation for Patients with Early-Stage, Favorable Hodgkin Lymphoma: The experience of the Gruppo Italiano Studio Linfomi|journal = [[Cancer (journal)|Cancer]]|year = 2003|volume = 98|issue = 11|pages = 2393–2401|pmid = 14635074|doi = 10.1002/cncr.11807|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.11807/pdf|format = pdf|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151203004824/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.11807/pdf|archivedate = 2015-12-03|df = }}</ref>

==Isolation and synthesis==
Vinblastine may be isolated from the Madagascar Periwinkle (''[[Catharanthus roseus]]''), along with several of its precursors, [[catharanthine]] and [[vindoline]].  Extraction is costly and yields of vinblastine and its precursors are low, although procedures for rapid isolation with improved yields avoiding auto-oxidation have been developed.  Enantioselective synthesis has been of considerable interest in recent years, as the natural mixture of isomers is not an economical source for the required C16’S, C14’R  stereochemistry of biologically active vinblastine.  Initially, the approach depends upon an enantioselective Sharpless epoxidation, which sets the stereochemistry at C20.  The desired configuration around C16 and C14 can then be fixed during the ensuing steps.  In this pathway, vinblastine is constructed by a series of cyclization and coupling reactions which create the required stereochemistry.  The overall yield may be as great as 22%, which makes this synthetic approach more attractive than extraction from natural sources, whose overall yield is about 10%.<ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Kuehne, M.

== History ==
Vinblastine was first isolated by [[Robert Noble]] and [[Charles Thomas Beer]] at the University of [[Western Ontario]] from the [[Madagascar periwinkle]] plant. Vinblastine's utility as a chemotherapeutic agent was first suggested by its effect on the body when an extract of the plant was injected in rabbits to study the plant's supposed anti-diabetic effect. (A tea made from the plant was a folk-remedy for diabetes.) The rabbits succumbed to a bacterial infection, due to a [[leukopenia|decreased number of white blood cells]], so it was hypothesized that vinblastine might be effective against cancers of the [[white blood cell]]s such as [[lymphoma]].<ref>R.C. Noble, C.T. Beer, and J.H. Cutts (5 December 1958) "Role of chance observations in chemotherapy:  ''Vinca rosea''," ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'', '''76''' (3):  882-894.</ref>
