'''5-EAPB''' ('''1-(benzofuran-5-yl)-''N''-ethylpropan-2-amine''') is an [[entactogenic]] [[Substituted amphetamine|amphetamine]] which is structurally related to [[5-MAPB]] and [[5-APB]]. It might be predicted to show similar effects to these drugs in humans, but the pharmacology of 5-EAPB remains unstudied as of 2013.

5-EAPB is similar in structure to compounds such as [[5-APB]] which are claimed to be agonists of the [[5-HT2C|5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor]] <ref>{{ cite patent

==Legality==
As an N-ethyl derivative of 5-APB, 5-EAPB falls outside the scope of the Temporary Class Drug ban issued by the Home Office on June 10, 2013,<ref name="ACMD report">{{cite web | url = https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/temporary-class-drug-order-report-on-benzofury-and-nbome-compounds | title = Temporary class drug order report on 5-6APB and NBOMe compounds | accessdate = 2013-07-10 | date = 4 Jun 2013 | publisher = UK Home Office}}</ref> and remains uncontrolled in the UK as of November 2013.
The ACMD has advised that 5-EAPB (and other -APBs) are moved to Class B,<ref>https://www.gov.uk/government/news/acmd-recommends-permanent-ban-on-two-legal-highs</ref> this will likely come into action on 10 June 2014.

5-EAPB is listed in the Fifth Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) and therefore illegal in Singapore as of May 2015.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cnb.gov.sg/Libraries/CNB_Newsroom_Files/CNB_NR_-_30_Apr_2015.sflb.ashx | title=CNB NEWS RELEASE | publisher=Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) | date=30 April 2015 | accessdate=24 July 2015}}</ref>

==Adverse reactions and deaths==
Three people in their 30s were hospitalised after each taking approximately 500&nbsp;mg of 5-EAPB, one of whom later died in hospital, whilst attending Brownstock music festival in Essex, UK on August 31, 2013.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/sep/01/festivalgoer-death-drug-warning-brownstock Festivalgoer's death prompts drug warning.
