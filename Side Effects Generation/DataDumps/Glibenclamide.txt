'''Glibenclamide''', also known as '''glyburide''', is an [[antidiabetic drug]] in a class of medications known as [[sulfonylurea]]s, closely related to [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]] [[antibiotics]]. It was developed in 1966 in a cooperative study between [[Boehringer Mannheim]] (now part of [[Hoffmann–La Roche|Roche]]) and [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst]] (now part of [[Sanofi-Aventis]]).<ref name="pmid4999930">{{cite journal | author = Marble A | title = Glibenclamide, a new sulphonylurea: whither oral hypoglycaemic agents? | journal = Drugs | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 109–15 | year = 1971 | pmid = 4999930 | doi = 10.2165/00003495-197101020-00001 }}</ref>

== Medical uses ==
It is used in the treatment of [[type 2 diabetes]]. As of 2003, in the United States, it was the most popular sulfonylurea.<ref name="pmid12574174">{{cite journal | author = Riddle MC | title = Editorial: sulfonylureas differ in effects on ischemic preconditioning--is it time to retire glyburide? | journal = J.

It is not as good as either [[metformin]] or [[insulin]] in those who have [[gestational diabetes]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Balsells|first1=M|last2=García-Patterson|first2=A|last3=Solà|first3=I|last4=Roqué|first4=M|last5=Gich|first5=I|last6=Corcoy|first6=R|title=Glibenclamide, metformin, and insulin for the treatment of gestational diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=21 January 2015|volume=350|pages=h102|pmid=25609400|doi=10.1136/bmj.h102|pmc=4301599}}</ref>

== Side effects and contraindications ==
This drug is a major cause of drug-induced [[hypoglycemia]]. The risk is greater than with other [[sulfonylurea]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gangji|first=A. S.|author2=Cukierman, T. |author3=Gerstein, H. C. |author4=Goldsmith, C. H. |author5= Clase, C.

Glibenclamide may be not recommended in those with G6PD deficiency, as it may cause acute haemolysis.<ref name="pmid8562390">{{cite journal |vauthors=Meloni G, Meloni T | title = Glyburide-induced acute haemolysis in a G6PD-deficient patient with NIDDM | journal = Br.

== Mechanism of action ==
The drug works by binding to and inhibiting the [[ATP-sensitive potassium channel]]s (K<sub>ATP</sub>) inhibitory regulatory subunit [[sulfonylurea receptor|sulfonylurea receptor 1]] (SUR1) <ref name="pmid17015627">{{cite journal |vauthors=Serrano-Martín X, Payares G, Mendoza-León A | title = Glibenclamide, a blocker of K+(ATP) channels, shows antileishmanial activity in experimental murine cutaneous leishmaniasis | journal = Antimicrob.

This inhibition causes cell membrane [[depolarization]], opening [[voltage-dependent calcium channel]]s.  This results in an increase in intracellular [[calcium]] in the [[beta cell]] and subsequent stimulation of [[insulin]] release.

After a cerebral ischemic insult, the [[blood–brain barrier]] is broken and glibenclamide can reach the central nervous system. Glibenclamide has been shown to bind more efficiently to the ischemic hemisphere.<ref name="pmid22387180">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ortega FJ, Gimeno-Bayon J, Espinosa-Parrilla JF, Carrasco JL, Batlle M, Pugliese M, Mahy N, Rodríguez MJ | title = ATP-dependent potassium channel blockade strengthens microglial neuroprotection after hypoxia-ischemia in rats | journal = Exp.
