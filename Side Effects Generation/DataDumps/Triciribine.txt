'''Triciribine''' is a cancer drug which was first synthesized in the 1970s and [[clinical trials|studied clinically]] in the 1980s and 1990s without success. Following the discovery in the early 2000s that the drug would be effective against tumours with hyperactivated [[Protein kinase B|Akt]], it is now again under consideration in a variety of cancers. As PTX-200, the drug is currently in two early stage clinical trials in breast cancer and ovarian cancer being conducted by the small molecule drug development company [[Prescient Therapeutics]].

== Background ==

Triciribine is a cell-permeable tricyclic [[nucleoside]] that inhibits the phosphorylation, activation, and signalling of all three family members of Akt - Akt-1, Akt-2 and Akt-3. These are [[serine]]/[[threonine]] protein [[kinase]]s in the [[phosphoinositide 3-kinase]] (PI3K) signalling pathway that play a critical role in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival. Following recruitment of Akt to the plasma membrane, phosphorylation at threonine 308 and serine 473 (Akt-1 numbering) by [[Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1|PDK-1]] or PDK-2 results in full activation of the enzyme. Triciribine does not inhibit PI3K or PDK1, the direct upstream activators of Akt, nor does it inhibit [[Protein kinase C|PKC]], [[Protein kinase A|PKA]], [[Extracellular signal-regulated kinases|ERK]]1/2, serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase, p38, [[STAT3]], or JNK signalling pathways.<ref>{{cite journal
