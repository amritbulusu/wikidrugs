'''Butorphanol''' (BC 2627) is a [[morphinan]]-type synthetic [[agonist–antagonist]] [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] developed by [[Bristol-Myers]].<ref name="Elks2014">{{cite book|author=J.

It is now only available in its generic formulations, manufactured by Novex, [[Mylan]], Apotex and Ben Venue Laboratories. Butorphanol is most closely structurally related to [[levorphanol]]. Butorphanol is available as the tartrate salt in injectable, tablet, and intranasal spray formulations. The tablet form is only used in dogs and cats due to low bioavailability  in humans.

==Medical uses==
The most common indication for butorphanol is management of [[migraine]] using the intranasal spray formulation. It may also be used [[parenteral]]ly for management of moderate-to-severe pain, as a supplement for balanced general [[anesthesia]], and management of pain during [[Labour (childbirth)|labor]].  Butorphanol is also quite effective at reducing post-operative shivering (owing to its Kappa agonist activity). Butorphanol is more effective in reducing pain in women than in men.<ref name=gear/>

==Pharmacology==
Butorphanol exhibits [[partial agonist]] and [[opioid antagonist|antagonist]] activity at the [[μ-opioid receptor]], as well as partial agonist activity at the [[κ-opioid receptor]] (K<sub>i</sub> = 2.5 nM; [[EC50|EC<sub>50</sub>]] = 57 nM; [[intrinsic activity|E<sub>max</sub>]] = 57%).<ref name=gear>{{cite journal | first = RW | last = Gear |author2=Miaskowski C |author3=Gordon NC |author4=Paul SM |author5=Heller PH |author6=Levine JD  |date=November 1999 | title = The kappa opioid nalbuphine produces gender- and dose-dependent analgesia and antianalgesia in patients with postoperative pain | journal = Pain | volume = 83 | issue = 2 | pages = 339–45 | pmid = 10534607 | doi = 10.1016/S0304-3959(99)00119-0}}</ref><ref name="GharagozlouHashemi2006">{{cite journal|last1=Gharagozlou|first1=Parham|last2=Hashemi|first2=Ezzat|last3=DeLorey|first3=TimothyM|last4=Clark|first4=J David|last5=Lameh|first5=Jelveh|title=Pharmacological profiles of opioid ligands at Kappa opioid receptors|journal=BMC Pharmacology|volume=6|issue=1|year=2006|pages=3|issn=1471-2210|doi=10.1186/1471-2210-6-3|pmid=16433932|pmc=1403760}}</ref> Stimulation of these receptors on [[central nervous system]] [[neuron]]s causes an intracellular [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibition]] of [[adenylate cyclase]], closing of influx membrane [[voltage-dependent calcium channel|calcium channels]], and opening of membrane [[potassium channel]]s. This leads to hyperpolarization of the cell [[membrane potential]] and suppression of action potential transmission of ascending pain pathways.
Because of its κ-agonist activity, at analgesic doses butorphanol increases pulmonary arterial pressure and cardiac work. Additionally, κ-agonism can cause [[dysphoria]] at therapeutic or supertherapeutic doses; this gives butorphanol a lower potential for abuse than other opioid drugs.<ref>http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/quality_safety/4.1ButhorphanolCritReview.pdf</ref>

==Side effects==
As with other opioid analgesics, central nervous system effects (such as [[sedation]], [[mental confusion|confusion]], and [[dizziness]]) are considerations with butorphanol. [[Nausea]] and [[vomiting]] are common. Less common are the gastrointestinal effects of other opioids (mostly constipation).  Another side effect experienced by people taking the medication is increased perspiration.

==Society and culture==

===Name===
''Butorphanol'' is the [[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]], and [[Australian Approved Name|AAN]], while ''torbugesic'' is the [[Japanese Accepted Name|JAN]].<ref name="Elks2014" /><ref name="IndexNominum2000" /><ref name="MortonHall2012" /> As the [[tartrate]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]], butorphanol is known as ''butorphanol tartrate'' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]]).<ref name="Elks2014" /><ref name="IndexNominum2000" /><ref name="MortonHall2012" />

===Availability===
Butorphanol is available in the U.S. as a [[generic drug]]; it is available in various nations under one of any number of trade names, including Moradol and Beforal (Brand name Stadol no longer available in the US); veterinary trade names include Butorphic, Dolorex, Morphasol, Torbugesic, and Torbutrol.

===Legality===
Butorphanol is listed under the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs|Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961]] and in the United States is a Schedule IV Narcotic controlled substance with a DEA ACSCN of 9720; being in Schedule IV it is not subject to annual aggregate manufacturing quotas. The free base conversion ratio of the hydrochloride is 0.69.<ref>http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/quotas/conv_factor/index.html</ref> Butorphanol was originally in Schedule II and at one point it was decontrolled.

==Veterinary use==
In [[veterinary anesthesia]], butorphanol (trade name: Torbugesic) is widely used as a [[sedative]] and analgesic in dogs, cats and horses. For sedation, it may be combined with tranquilizers such as alpha-2 agonists ([[medetomidine]]), benzodiazepines, or [[acepromazine]] in dogs, cats and exotic animals. It is frequently combined with [[xylazine]] or [[detomidine]] in horses.<ref>NOAH Compendium of Data Sheets for Animal Medicines 2005</ref>

Butorphanol is frequently used for post-operative and accident-related pain in small mammals such as dogs, cats, ferrets, coatis, raccoons, mongooses, various marsupials, some rodents and perhaps some larger birds, both in the operating suite and as a regular prescription medication for home use, for management of moderate to severe pain. 

Although butorphanol is commonly used for pain relief in reptiles, no studies (as of 2014) have conclusively shown that is an effective analgesic in reptiles.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sladky|first1=KK|editor1-last=Mader|editor1-first=DR|editor2-last=Divers|editor2-first=SJ|title=Current therapy in reptile medicine & surgery|date=2014|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780323242936|pages=217–229|chapter=Chapter 18: Analgesia}}</ref>

===Use in horses===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
Butorphanol is a commonly used narcotic for pain relief in horses. It is administered either IM or IV, with its analgesic properties beginning to take effect about 15 minutes after injection and lasting 4 hours. It is also commonly paired with sedatives, such as [[xylazine]] and [[detomidine]], to make the horse easier to handle during veterinary procedures.

Side effects specific to horses include sedation, CNS excitement (displayed by [[head pressing]] or tossing). Overdosing may result in seizures, falling, salivation, constipation, and muscle twitching. If an overdose occurs, a narcotic antagonist, such as [[naloxone]], may be given. Caution should be used if butorphanol is administered in addition to other narcotics, sedatives, depressants, or antihistamines as it will cause an additive effect.

Butorphanol can cross the placenta, and it will be present in the milk of lactating mares who are given the drug.

The drug is also prohibited for use in competition by most equestrian organizations, including the [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|FEI]], which considers it a class A drug.
