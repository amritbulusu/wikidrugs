'''Phenadoxone (Heptalgin, Morphidone, Heptazone)''' is an [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] of the [[open chain]] class ([[methadone]] and relatives) invented in Germany by [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst]] in 1947. It is one of a handful of useful synthetic analgesics which were used in the United States for various lengths of time in the 20 or so years after the end of the [[Second World War]] but which were withdrawn from the market for various or no known reason and which now are mostly in Schedule I of the United States' Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or (like [[phenazocine]] and [[bezitramide]]) in Schedule II but not produced or marketed in the US.  Others on this list are [[ketobemidone]] (Ketogin), [[dextromoramide]] (Dimorlin, Palfium and others), [[phenazocine]] (Narphen and Prinadol), [[dipipanone]] (Diconal, Pipadone and Wellconal), [[piminodine]] (Alvodine), [[propiram]] (Algeril), [[anileridine]] (Leritine) and [[alphaprodine]] (Nisentil).

Phenadoxone has a US DEA ACSCN of 9637 and recently has had a zero annual manufacturing quota under the Controlled Substances Act 1970<ref>http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/quotas/2013/fr0620.htm</ref>  Its withdrawal from US distribution prior to the promulgation of said act is a large part of its Schedule I designation; it is, however, used as a legitimate medication in other countries and consumption is increasing worldwide as indicated below.

Phenadoxone is generally considered to be a strong opioid analgesic and is regulated in much the same way as [[morphine]] where it is used. The usual starting dose is 10â€“20&nbsp;mg and it has a duration of analgesic effect of 1 to 4 hours.  By comparison, [[methadone]] has an analgesic effect lasting from 3 to 6 hours although for use in opioid maintenance the dose is different from that used for analgesia and the sought effect of suppressing withdrawal symptoms for 24-48 hours but after a small time euphoria disappears and euphoria is blocked from practically all other opioids. Phenadoxone is not used at this time for purposes other than pain relief.

Worldwide consumption of phenadoxone has actually increased slightly in recent years according to a recent report from the [[World Health Organisation]]. Like its drug subcategory prototype methadone, phenadoxone can be used as the opioid analgesic in Brompton Mixture, aka [[Brompton cocktail]].  Phenadoxone is most used at the current time in [[Denmark]] and various countries in eastern Europe.
