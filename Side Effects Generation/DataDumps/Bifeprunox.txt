'''Bifeprunox''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) (code name '''DU-127,090''') is an [[atypical antipsychotic]] which, similarly to [[aripiprazole]], combines minimal [[D2 receptor|D<sub>2</sub> receptor]] [[agonist|agonism]] with [[serotonin receptor]] agonism.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cuisiat S, Bourdiol N, Lacharme V, Newman-Tancredi A, Colpaert F, Vacher B |title=Towards a new generation of potential antipsychotic agents combining D2 and 5-HT1A receptor activities |journal=J.

Bifeprunox has a novel mechanism of action. Conventional antipsychotics are classed into typical and atypical. The [[typical antipsychotics]], such as [[chlorpromazine]] and [[haloperidol]], are potent D<sub>2</sub> [[receptor antagonist]]s. The [[atypical antipsychotic]]s started with [[clozapine]], these are classified as multireceptor interacting compounds, acting as an agonist towards 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and an antagonist towards D<sub>2</sub> receptors among other 5-HT and DA receptors. Bifeprunox and other novel atypical antipsychotics will instead of antagonizing D<sub>2</sub> receptors, will act as [[partial agonist]]s, as well as partial agonists towards 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bardin L, Auclair A, Kleven MS |title=Pharmacological profiles in rats of novel antipsychotics with combined dopamine D2/serotonin 5-HT1A activity: comparison with typical and atypical conventional antipsychotics |journal=Behav Pharmacol |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=103–18 |year=2007 |pmid=17351418 |doi=10.1097/FBP.0b013e3280ae6c96|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

In a multi-center, placebo-controlled study, 20&nbsp;mg of bifeprunox was found to be significantly more effective than placebo at reducing symptoms of schizophrenia, with a low incidence of side effects.<ref name="pmid18597078">{{cite journal

An NDA for Bifeprunox was filed with the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] in January 2007. The FDA rejected the application in August 2007.<ref>[http://www.finanznachrichten.de/nachrichten-2007-08/artikel-8796651.asp Wyeth and Solvay say FDA rejects application for antipsychotic drug bifeprunox.] Thomson Financial, August 10, 2007.</ref> In June 2009, Solvay and Lundbeck decided to cease development because "efficacy data did not support pursuing the existing development strategy of stabilisation of non-acute patients with schizophrenia."<ref name="Lundbeck" />
