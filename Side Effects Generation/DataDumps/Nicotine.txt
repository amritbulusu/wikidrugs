'''Nicotine''' is a [[potency (pharmacology)|potent]] [[parasympathomimetic]] stimulant and an [[alkaloid]] found in the [[nightshade]] family of plants. Nicotine acts as an [[agonist]] at most [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s (nAChRs),<ref name="IUPHAR" /><ref name="Malenka Nicotine" /> except at two [[nicotinic receptor subunits]] ([[nAChRα9]] and [[nAChRα10]]) where it acts as a [[receptor antagonist]].<ref name=IUPHAR /> Nicotine is found in the leaves of ''[[Nicotiana rustica]]'', in amounts of 2–14%;  in the [[tobacco]] plant, ''[[Nicotiana tabacum]]''; in ''[[Duboisia hopwoodii]]''; and in ''[[Asclepias syriaca]]''.<ref name="metcalf">{{citation|author=Robert L.

When a [[cigarette]] is smoked, nicotine-rich blood passes from the [[human lung|lungs]] to the [[human brain|brain]] within seven seconds and immediately stimulates [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s; this indirectly promotes the release of many chemical messengers such as [[acetylcholine]], [[norepinephrine]], [[epinephrine]], [[arginine vasopressin]], [[serotonin]], [[dopamine]], and [[beta-endorphin]] in parts of the brain.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pomerleau|first1=Ovide F.|last2=Pomerleau|first2=Cynthia S.|title=Neuroregulators and the reinforcement of smoking: Towards a biobehavioral explanation|journal=Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews|volume=8|issue=4|year=1984|pages=503–513|doi=10.1016/0149-7634(84)90007-1|pmid=6151160}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pomerleau|first1=Ovide F.|last2=Rosecrans|first2=John|title=Neuroregulatory effects of nicotine|journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology|volume=14|issue=6|year=1989|pages=407–423|doi=10.1016/0306-4530(89)90040-1}}</ref> Nicotine also extends the duration of positive effects of dopamine and increases the sensitivity of the brain's [[reward system]] to [[rewarding stimuli]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Easton, John |title=Nicotine extends duration of pleasant effects of dopamine |journal=The University of Chicago Chronicle|volume=21|issue=12|date=March 28, 2002|url=http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/020328/nicotine.shtml}}</ref><ref name=Kenny>{{cite journal|vauthors=Kenny PJ, Markou A |title=Nicotine self-administration acutely activates brain reward systems and induces a long-lasting increase in reward sensitivity|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|volume=31|issue=6|pages=1203–11|date=Jun 2006|doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1300905|pmid=16192981}}</ref> Most cigarettes contain 1–3 milligrams of inhalable nicotine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/nicotine/nicotine_dose.shtml|title=Erowid Nicotine Vault: Dosage|publisher=Erowid.org|date=2011-10-14|accessdate=2012-12-19}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2017}} Studies suggest that when smokers wish to achieve a stimulating effect, they take short quick puffs, which produce a low level of blood nicotine.<ref>{{cite book|doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-0888-9_9|chapter=Factors Governing Recruitment to and Maintenance of Smoking|title=Drug and Alcohol Use|year=1989|last1=Golding|first1=J.

The primary therapeutic use of nicotine is in treating nicotine dependence in order to eliminate [[smoking]] with the damage it does to health. Controlled levels of nicotine are given to patients through [[nicotine gum|gums]], [[nicotine patches|dermal patches]], lozenges, electronic/substitute cigarettes or nasal sprays in an effort to wean them off their dependence. Studies have found that these therapies increase the chance of success of quitting by 50 to 70%,<ref name=CD000146/> though reductions in the population as a whole have not been demonstrated.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031811-124624|title=Quitlines and Nicotine Replacement for Smoking Cessation: Do We Need to Change Policy?|year=2012|last1=Pierce|first1=John P.|last2=Cummins|first2=Sharon E.|last3=White|first3=Martha M.|last4=Humphrey|first4=Aimee|last5=Messer|first5=Karen|journal=Annual Review of Public Health|volume=33|pages=341–56|pmid=22224888}}</ref>

===Fetal development===
In pregnancy, a 2013 review noted that "nicotine is only 1 of more than 4000 compounds to which the fetus is exposed through maternal smoking. Of these, ∼30 compounds have been associated with adverse health outcomes. Although the exact mechanisms by which nicotine produces adverse fetal effects are unknown, it is likely that hypoxia, undernourishment of the fetus, and direct vasoconstrictor effects on the placental and umbilical vessels all play a role. Nicotine also has been shown to have significant deleterious effects on brain development, including alterations in brain metabolism and neurotransmitter systems and abnormal brain development." It also notes that "abnormalities of newborn neurobehavior, including impaired orientation and autonomic regulation and abnormalities of muscle tone, have been identified in a number of prenatal nicotine exposure studies" and that there is weak data associating fetal nicotine exposure with newborn [[facial cleft]]s, and that there is no good evidence for newborns suffering [[nicotine withdrawal]] from fetal exposure to nicotine.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Behnke M, Smith VC |title=Prenatal substance abuse: short- and long-term effects on the exposed fetus |journal=Pediatrics |volume=131 |issue=3 |pages=e1009–24 |date=March 2013  |doi=10.1542/peds.2012-3931 |pmid=23439891}}</ref>

===Reinforcement disorders{{anchor|Dependence and withdrawal}}===
{{see also|Nicotine withdrawal|Smoking cessation}}
[[Nicotine dependence]] involves aspects of both [[psychological dependence]] and [[physical dependence]], since discontinuation of extended use has been shown to produce both affective (e.g., anxiety, irritability, craving, [[anhedonia]]) and somatic (mild motor dysfunctions such as [[tremor]]) withdrawal symptoms.<ref name="Dependence-withdrawal">{{cite journal | vauthors = D'Souza MS, Markou A | title = Neuronal mechanisms underlying development of nicotine dependence: implications for novel smoking-cessation treatments | journal = Addict Sci Clin Pract | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–16 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22003417 | pmc = 3188825 | doi = | quote = Withdrawal symptoms upon cessation of nicotine intake: Chronic nicotine use induces neuroadaptations in the brain’s reward system that result in the development of nicotine dependence. Thus, nicotine-dependent smokers must continue nicotine intake to avoid distressing somatic and affective withdrawal symptoms. Newly abstinent smokers experience symptoms such as depressed mood, anxiety, irritability, difficulty concentrating, craving, bradycardia, insomnia, gastrointestinal discomfort, and weight gain (Shiffman and Jarvik, 1976; Hughes et al., 1991). Experimental animals, such as rats and mice, exhibit a nicotine withdrawal syndrome that, like the human syndrome, includes both somatic signs and a negative affective state (Watkins et al., 2000; Malin et al., 2006). The somatic signs of nicotine withdrawal include rearing, jumping, shakes, abdominal constrictions, chewing, scratching, and facial tremors. The negative affective state of nicotine withdrawal is characterized by decreased responsiveness to previously rewarding stimuli, a state called anhedonia.}}</ref> Withdrawal symptoms peak in the first day or two<ref name=Hughes2007>{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=John|title=Effects of abstinence from tobacco: Etiology, animal models, epidemiology, and significance: A subjective review|journal=Nicotine & Tobacco Research|volume=9|issue=3|year=2007|pages=329–339|issn=1462-2203|doi=10.1080/14622200701188927|pmid=17365765}}</ref> and can persist for several weeks.<ref name="HKS2010">{{cite journal | title=Meta-analysis of the acute effects of nicotine and smoking on human performance | author=Heishman, SJ, Kleykamp, BA, Singleton, EG | journal=Pharmacology |date=July 2010  | volume=210 | issue=4 | pages=453–69 | doi=10.1007/s00213-010-1848-1 | quote=The significant effects of nicotine on motor abilities, attention, and memory likely represent true performance enhancement because they are not confounded by withdrawal relief.

The formation of ΔFosB in multiple brain regions, and the molecular pathway leading to the formation of AP-1 complexes is well understood. The establishment of a functional purpose for ΔFosB has allowed further determination as to some of the key aspects of its molecular cascades, involving effectors such as GluR2 (87,88), Cdk5 (93) and NFkB (100). Moreover, many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the structural, physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure (60,95,97,102). New frontiers of research investigating the molecular roles of ΔFosB have been opened by epigenetic studies, and recent advances have illustrated the role of ΔFosB acting on DNA and histones, truly as a ‘‘molecular switch’’ (34). As a consequence of our improved understanding of ΔFosB in addiction, it is possible to evaluate the addictive potential of current medications (119), as well as use it as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions (121,122,124).}}</ref><ref name="RouteDFosB Primary">{{cite journal |vauthors=Marttila K, Raattamaa H, Ahtee L | title = Effects of chronic nicotine administration and its withdrawal on striatal FosB/DeltaFosB and c-Fos expression in rats and mice | journal = Neuropharmacology | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 44–51 | date = July 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2006.02.014 | pmid = 16631212}}</ref> Consequently, repeated daily exposure (possibly excluding [[oral route]]) to nicotine can result in accumbal ΔFosB overexpression, in turn causing nicotine addiction.<ref name="Nestler 2013Rev" /><ref name="Addiction molecular neurobiology" />

The amount of nicotine absorbed by the body from smoking can depend on many factors, including the types of tobacco, whether the smoke is inhaled, and whether a filter is used.

The biosynthetic pathway of nicotine involves a coupling reaction between the two cyclic structures that compose nicotine.

The NAD pathway in the genus ''[[nicotiana]]'' begins with the oxidation of aspartic acid into α-imino succinate by aspartate oxidase (AO). This is followed by a condensation with [[glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate]] and a cyclization catalyzed by quinolinate synthase (QS) to give [[quinolinic acid]]. Quinolinic acid then reacts with phosphoriboxyl pyrophosphate catalyzed by quinolinic acid phosphoribosyl transferase (QPT) to form niacin mononucleotide (NaMN). The reaction now proceeds via the NAD salvage cycle to produce niacin via the conversion of [[nicotinamide]] by the enzyme [[nicotinamidase]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The ''N''-methyl-Δ<sup>1</sup>-pyrrollidium cation used in the synthesis of nicotine is an intermediate in the synthesis of tropane-derived alkaloids. Biosynthesis begins with [[decarboxylation]] of [[ornithine]] by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) to produce [[putrescine]]. Putrescine is then converted into ''N''-methyl putrescine via [[methylation]] by SAM catalyzed by putrescine ''N''-methyltransferase (PMT). ''N''-methylputrescine then undergoes [[deamination]] into 4-methylaminobutanal by the ''N''-methylputrescine oxidase (MPO) enzyme, 4-methylaminobutanal then spontaneously cyclize into ''N''-methyl-Δ<sup>1</sup>-pyrrollidium cation.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The final step in the synthesis of nicotine is the coupling between ''N''-methyl-Δ<sup>1</sup>-pyrrollidium cation and niacin. Although studies conclude some form of coupling between the two component structures, the definite process and mechanism remains undetermined. The current agreed theory involves the conversion of niacin into 2,5-dihydropyridine through 3,6-dihydronicotinic acid. The 2,5-dihydropyridine intermediate would then react with ''N''-methyl-Δ<sup>1</sup>-pyrrollidium cation to form [[enantiomer]]ically pure (–)-nicotine.<ref name=plant-meta>{{cite book |editor1-first=Hiroshi |editor1-last=Ashihara |editor2-first=Alan |editor2-last=Crozier |editor3-first=Atsushi |editor3-last=Komamine |title=Plant metabolism and biotechnology |publisher=Wiley |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-470-74703-2}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref>

===Detection in body fluids===

Nicotine can be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning or to facilitate a medicolegal death investigation. Urinary or salivary cotinine concentrations are frequently measured for the purposes of pre-employment and health insurance medical screening programs. Careful interpretation of results is important, since passive exposure to cigarette smoke can result in significant accumulation of nicotine, followed by the appearance of its metabolites in various body fluids.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Benowitz|first=Neal L.|last2=Hukkanen|first2=Janne|last3=Jacob|first3=Peyton|date=2009-01-01|title=Nicotine Chemistry, Metabolism, Kinetics and Biomarkers|journal=Handbook of experimental pharmacology|volume=192|issue=192|pages=29–60|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-69248-5_2|issn=0171-2004|pmc=2953858|pmid=19184645|series=Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology|isbn=978-3-540-69246-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Randall Clint |last=Baselt|title=Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man|year=2014|publisher=Biomedical Publications|isbn=978-0-9626523-9-4|edition=10th|pages=1452–6}}</ref> Nicotine use is not regulated in competitive sports programs.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Mündel T, Jones DA|title=Effect of transdermal nicotine administration on exercise endurance in men|journal=Experimental Physiology|volume=91|issue=4|pages=705–13|date=July 2006|doi=10.1113/expphysiol.2006.033373|pmid=16627574}}</ref>

==History==
{{See also|History of tobacco}}
Nicotine is named after the tobacco plant ''[[Nicotiana tabacum]],'' which in turn is named after the [[France|French]] ambassador in [[Portugal]], [[Jean Nicot|Jean Nicot de Villemain]], who sent tobacco and seeds to [[Paris]] in 1560, presented to the French King,<ref name="Rang H. P 2007, page 598">Rang H. P et al., Rang and Dale's Pharmacology 6th Edition, 2007, Elsevier, page 598</ref> and who promoted their medicinal use. Smoking was believed to protect against illness, particularly the plague.<ref name="Rang H. P 2007, page 598"/>

[[Tobacco]] was introduced to [[Europe]] in 1559, and by the late 17th century, it was used not only for [[smoking]] but also as an [[insecticide]]. After [[World War II]], over 2,500 tons of nicotine insecticide were used worldwide, but by the 1980s the use of nicotine insecticide had declined below 200 tons. This was due to the availability of other insecticides that are cheaper and less harmful to [[mammal]]s.<ref name=Ujvary/>

Currently, nicotine, even in the form of tobacco dust, is prohibited as a [[pesticide]] for [[organic farming]] in the United States.<ref>US Code of Federal Regulations.

===Chemical identification===
Nicotine was first isolated from the tobacco plant in 1828 by physician Wilhelm Heinrich Posselt and chemist Karl Ludwig Reimann of [[Germany]], who considered it a poison.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Posselt, W.|author2=Reimann, L.|title=Chemische Untersuchung des Tabaks und Darstellung eines eigenthümlich wirksamen Prinzips dieser Pflanze|trans_title=Chemical investigation of tobacco and preparation of a characteristically active constituent of this plant|language=German|journal=Magazin für Pharmacie|volume=6|issue=24|pages=138–161|year=1828|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cgkCAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA138}}</ref><ref name="pmid16463054">{{cite journal|vauthors=Henningfield JE, Zeller M|title=Nicotine psychopharmacology research contributions to United States and global tobacco regulation: a look back and a look forward|journal=Psychopharmacology|volume=184|issue=3–4|pages=286–91|date=March 2006|doi=10.1007/s00213-006-0308-4|pmid=16463054}}</ref> Its chemical [[empirical formula]] was described by [[Louis Melsens|Melsens]] in 1843,<ref>Melsens, Louis-Henri-Frédéric (1843) [https://books.google.com/books?id=j-E3AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA465#v=onepage&q&f=false "Note sur la nicotine,"] ''Annales de chimie et de physique'', third series, vol. 9, pages 465-479; see especially page 470.

==Society and culture==

The nicotine content of popular American-brand cigarettes has increased over time, and one study found that there was an average increase of 1.78% per year between the years of 1998 and 2005.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Connolly|first1=G.

==Research==

While acute/initial nicotine intake causes activation of nicotine receptors, chronic low doses of nicotine use leads to desensitisation of nicotine receptors (due to the development of tolerance) and results in an antidepressant effect, with early research showing low dose nicotine patches could be an effective treatment of [[major depressive disorder]] in non-smokers.<ref name="pmid20965579">{{cite journal|vauthors=Mineur YS, Picciotto MR|title=Nicotine receptors and depression: revisiting and revising the cholinergic hypothesis |journal=Trends Pharmacol.
