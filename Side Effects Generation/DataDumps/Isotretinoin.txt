'''Isotretinoin''', also known as '''13-''cis''-retinoic acid''' (and colloquially referred to by its former brand name '''Accutane'''), is a medication primarily used to treat [[Acne vulgaris|severe acne]]. Rarely, it is also used to prevent certain skin cancers ([[squamous-cell carcinoma]]), and in the treatment of other cancers. It is used to treat [[harlequin-type ichthyosis]], a usually lethal skin disease, and [[lamellar ichthyosis]]. It is a [[retinoid]], meaning it is related to [[vitamin A]], and is found in small quantities naturally in the body. Its [[isomer]], [[tretinoin]], is also an acne drug.

Isotretinoin is primarily used as a treatment for severe acne. The most common adverse effects are a transient worsening of acne (lasting 1-4 months), dry lips ([[cheilitis]]), dry and fragile skin, and an [[Photosensitivity|increased susceptibility to sunburn]].  Uncommon and rare side effects include muscle aches and pains ([[myalgia]]s), and headaches. Isotretinoin is known to cause [[teratogen|birth defects]] due to in utero exposure because of the molecule's close resemblance to [[retinoic acid]], a natural vitamin A derivative which controls normal embryonic development. It is also associated with psychiatric side effects, including depression.

In the United States, a special procedure is required to obtain the pharmaceutical. In most other countries, a consent form is required which explains these risks. Women taking isotretinoin must not get pregnant during and for 1 month after the discontinuation of isotretinoin therapy. [[Sexual abstinence]] or effective contraception is mandatory during this period. Barrier methods by themselves (e.g., [[condom]]s) are not considered adequate due to the unacceptable [[Comparison of birth control methods|failure rates]] of approximately 3%. Women who fall pregnant whilst on isotretinoin therapy are generally counselled to have a [[Abortion|termination]]. Isotretinoin has no effect on male fertility.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Millsop JW, Heller MM, Eliason MJ, Murase JE |title=Dermatological medication effects on male fertility |journal=Dermatol Ther |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=337–46 |year=2013 |pmid=23914891 |doi=10.1111/dth.12069 }}</ref>

Isotretinoin was first marketed as '''Accutane''' by [[Hoffmann-La Roche]]. It sold well for many years, but in 2009, Roche decided to remove Accutane from the US market after juries had awarded millions of dollars in damages to former Accutane users over [[inflammatory bowel disease]] claims.  It then became generic and as of 2017 was marketed under many brand names worldwide.<ref name=brands/>

It is also somewhat effective for [[hidradenitis suppurativa]] and some cases of severe [[acne rosacea]].<ref name="Micromedex">Klasco RK, editor. Drugdex system, vol. 128. Greenwood Village (CO): Thomson Micromedex; 2006.{{Page needed|date=May 2012}}</ref> It can also be used to help treat [[Harlequin-type ichthyosis|harlequin ichthyosis]], lamellar ichthyosis and is used in [[xeroderma pigmentosum]] cases to relieve [[keratose]]s. Isotretinoin has been used to treat the extremely rare condition [[fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva]]. It is also used for treatment of [[neuroblastoma]], a form of nerve cancer.

Isotretinoin therapy has furthermore proven effective against [[genital warts]] in experimental use, but is rarely used for this indication as there are more effective treatments. Isotretinoin may represent an efficacious and safe alternative systemic form of therapy for [[recalcitrant condylomata acuminata]] (RCA) of the cervix. In most countries this therapy is currently unapproved and only used if other therapies failed.<ref name=Oral_isotretinoin_Therapy>{{cite journal |vauthors=Georgala S, Katoulis AC, Georgala C, Bozi E, Mortakis A | title = Oral isotretinoin in the treatment of recalcitrant condylomata acuminata of the cervix: a randomised placebo controlled trial | journal = Sex Transm Infect | volume = 80 | issue = 3 | pages = 216–8 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15170007 | pmc = 1744851 | doi = 10.1136/sti.2003.006841 }}</ref><ref name=Unapproved_Isotretinoin>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sehgal VN, Srivastava G, Sardana K | title = Isotretinoin--unapproved indications/uses and dosage: a physician's reference | journal = Int.

=== Prescribing restrictions ===
Isotretinoin is a [[teratogen]]; there is about a 20–35% risk for congenital defects in infants exposed to the drug ''in utero'', and about 30–60% of children exposed to isotretinoin prenatally have been reported to show neurocognitive impairment.<ref name=Choi2013>Choi JS, Koren G, Nulman I. Pregnancy and isotretinoin therapy. CMAJ. 2013 Mar 19;185(5):411-3. {{doi|10.1503/cmaj.120729}}. {{PMID|23296582}}. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3602257/ PMC 3602257]</ref>  Because of this, there are strict controls on prescribing isotretinoin to women who may become pregnant and women who become pregnant while taking isotretinoin are strongly advised to terminate their pregnancies.<ref name=Choi2013/>

In most countries, isotretinoin can only be prescribed by dermatologists or specialist physicians; some countries also allow limited prescription by general practitioners and family doctors. In the United Kingdom<ref name="BNF47">Joint Formulary Committee. [[British National Formulary]]. 47th ed. London: British Medical Association and Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain. {{ISBN|0-85369-584-9}}{{Page needed|date=May 2012}}</ref> and Australia,<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.australiandoctor.com.au/news/latest-news/fresh-call-for-gps-to-prescribe-roaccutane|title=Fresh call for GPs to prescribe Roaccutane|work=AustralianDoctor|date=19 June 2012}}</ref><ref>Specifically, doctors who are fellows of the Australasian College of Dermatologists (FACD); cf.

Because severe cystic acne has the potential to cause permanent scarring over a short period, restrictions on its more immediate availability have proved contentious.<ref name=James_1996>{{cite journal | author = James M | title = Isotretinoin for severe acne | journal = Lancet | volume = 347 | issue = 9017 | pages = 1749–50 | date = June 1996 | pmid = 8656912 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(96)90814-4 }}</ref> In New Zealand, isotretinoin can be prescribed by any doctor but subsidised only when prescribed by a vocationally-registered general practitioner, dermatologist or nurse practitioner.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Acne, Isotretinoin, and Depression|publisher=MEDSAFE (New Zealand Ministry of Health)|url=http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/profs/puarticles/isotretdtb.htm|origyear=June 2005|date=June 2013|accessdate=7 February 2014}}</ref>

In the United States, dispensing of isotretinoin is by an [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]-mandated website called [[iPLEDGE]]. iPLEDGE has applied to isotretinoin prescriptions since 1 March 2006. Under it, dermatologists must register their patients on the system before prescribing isotretinoin. Pharmacists must then verify the prescription on the iPLEDGE website before dispensing isotretinoin. The website allows no more than thirty days' supply of the drug to be prescribed or dispensed; and after issuance, another prescription may not be written for at least 30 days (even in the case of lost prescriptions). Prescriptions expire from iPLEDGE if not picked up from the pharmacy seven days after issuance. Physicians and pharmacists must verify written prescriptions on the system before filling an isotretinoin prescription. Due to the teratogenic effects of isotretinoin, iPLEDGE makes additional requirements of female patients filling prescriptions for the drug: women with child-bearing potential must commit to using two forms of effective contraception simultaneously for the duration of isotretinoin therapy and for a month immediately preceding and a month immediately following therapy. Additionally they must have two negative pregnancy tests 30 days apart and have negative pregnancy tests before each prescription is written.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ipledgeprogram.com/AboutiPLEDGE.aspx|title=iPledge (About iPledge)}}</ref> Alerts continue to exist against purchasing isotretinoin online.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm094305.htm|title=Isotretinoin (marketed as Accutane) Capsule Information|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)}}</ref>

== Adverse effects ==
Increasingly higher dosages will result in higher toxicity, resembling [[vitamin A toxicity]].

===  Skin and mucocutaneous tissue ===
The most common side effects are mucocutaneous: dry lips, skin and nose. Other common mucocutaneous side effects are inflammation and chapping of the lips ([[cheilitis]]), redness of the skin ([[erythema]]), rashes, peeling, eczema ([[dermatitis]]), itching ([[Itch|prunitis]]) and nose bleeds ([[Nosebleed|epistaxis]]).<ref name=Brelsford2008rev>{{cite journal|last1=Brelsford|first1=M|last2=Beute|first2=TC|title=Preventing and managing the side effects of isotretinoin.|journal=Seminars in cutaneous medicine and surgery|date=September 2008|volume=27|issue=3|pages=197–206|doi=10.1016/j.sder.2008.07.002|pmid=18786498}}</ref> Absence of dryness of the lips is considered an indication of non-compliance with treatment (not taking the drug as advised), as it occurs in almost all patients.<ref name=Brelsford2008rev/>

For this reason waxing of hair, tattooing, tattoo removal, piercings, dermabrasion, exfoliation, etc. are not recommended. Treatment of acne scars is generally deferred until 12 months after completion of a course of isotretinoin.

Acne usually flares up 2–3 weeks into the treatment and is usually mild and tolerable. Occasionally this flare-up is severe, necessitating oral antiobiotics such as [[erythromycin]]. A short course of oral [[prednisolone]] may be required. Some dermatologists favour a few weeks of pre-treatment with oral antibiotics before commencing isotretinoin to reduce the chance of a severe flare. A "stepped" course may also be used to reduce the chance of this initial flare, by which the initial dose is low (e.g. 0.5&nbsp;mg/kg) and subsequently increased throughout the course.

Isotretinoin use can rarely lead to a more severe form of acne, [[acne fulminans]].

=== Teratogenicity ===
{{anchor|Teratogenicity (Birth defects)|Teratogenicity (birth defects)}} <!-- This section is linked from [[Postpartum depression]] -->
Isotretinoin is a [[teratogen]] highly likely to cause birth defects if taken by women during pregnancy or even a short time before conception. A few of the more common birth defects this drug can cause are hearing and visual impairment, missing or malformed earlobes, facial dysmorphism, and abnormalities in brain function. Isotretinoin is classified as [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] [[Pregnancy category (pharmaceutical)|Pregnancy Category]] X and [[Australian Drug Evaluation Committee|ADEC]] Category X, and use is contraindicated in pregnancy.<ref name="Micromedex" />

The manufacturer recommends pregnancy be excluded in female patients two weeks prior to commencement of isotretinoin, and they should use two simultaneous forms of effective contraception at least one month prior to commencement, during, and for at least one month following isotretinoin therapy.<ref name="RoaccutanePI">Roche Products Pty Ltd.

In the [[United States|U.S.]], more than 2,000 women have become pregnant while taking the drug between 1982 and 2003, with most pregnancies ending in [[abortion]] or [[miscarriage]]. About 160 babies with birth defects were born. As a consequence, the [[iPLEDGE]] program was introduced by the U.S. FDA on 12 August 2005 in an attempt to ensure female patients receiving isotretinoin do not become pregnant. As of 1 March 2006, only prescribers registered and activated in iPLEDGE are able to prescribe isotretinoin, and only patients registered and qualified in iPLEDGE will be able to have isotretinoin dispensed by a registered pharmacy. All patients, including women not of child-bearing age and men, must register with iPLEDGE.  FDA's intent with the iPLEDGE program is to tightly control the distribution and dispensing of isotretinoin and thereby prevent the potential for distribution or sharing of the drug outside of the program to women of child-bearing age. In 2011, 155  pregnancies occurred among 129,544 women of childbearing potential taking isotrentinoin (0.12%)<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Leyden JJ, Del Rosso JQ, Baum EW | title = The use of isotretinoin in the treatment of acne vulgaris: clinical considerations and future directions | journal = J Clin Aesthet Dermatol | volume = 7 | issue = 2 Suppl | pages = S3–S21 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24688620 | pmc = 3970835 | doi =  }}</ref>

Patients receiving isotretinoin therapy are not permitted to donate blood during and for at least one month after discontinuation of therapy due to its teratogenicity.<ref>BNF, edition 57{{Page needed|date=October 2010}}</ref>

===Psychological effects===
The association between isotretinoin use and psychopathology has been controversial. Beginning in 1983, isolated case reports emerged suggesting mood change, particularly depression, occurring during or soon after isotretinoin use.<ref name=bjd2010>{{cite journal |vauthors=Goodfield MJ, Cox NH, Bowser A, McMillan JC, Millard LG, Simpson NB, Ormerod AD | title = Advice on the safe introduction and continued use of isotretinoin in acne in the U.K. 2010 | journal = British Journal of Dermatology | volume = 162 | issue = 6 | pages = 1172–1179 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21250961 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2010.09836.x | url = http://www.bad.org.uk/Portals/_Bad/Guidelines/Clinical%20Guidelines/Isotretinoin%20Guidelines%202010.pdf | issn = 0007-0963  | format = PDF }}</ref> A number of studies have been conducted since then of the drug's effect on depression, psychosis, suicidal thoughts and other psychological effects.<ref name=bjd2010/>

The product information leaflet distributed with isotretinoin states that rare psychological side effects may include depression, worsening of pre-existing depression, aggressive tendencies and anxiety. Very rare effects include abnormal behaviour, [[psychosis]], suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and [[suicide]].<ref name=UKLabel2015/> In a total of 5577 [[Adverse drug reaction|adverse reactions]] reported to the UK's [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency|MHRA]] up to 31 March 2017, the majority (1207, or 22%) concerned psychiatric effects.<ref name=MHRAreport>{{Cite web|url=https://info.mhra.gov.uk/drug-analysis-profiles/dap.html?drug=./UK_EXTERNAL/NONCOMBINED/UK_NON_000285965613.zip&agency=MHRA|title=Interactive Drug Analysis Profile - Isotretinoin|last=|first=|date=31 March 2017|website=mhra.gov.uk|publisher=Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref> There were 85 reports of suicidal ideation, 56 of completed suicide and 43 of suicide attempts.<ref name=MHRAreport/> Isotretinoin is the only non-psychiatric drug on the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]'s top 10 list of drugs associated with depression<ref name=Kontaxakis2009rev/> and is also within the top 10 for suicide attempts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wysowski|first=D.

In 2012, a systematic review covering all articles in the literature related to isotretinoin, depression and suicide, as well as articles related to class effect, dose response, and biologic plausibility found that the literature reviewed was consistent with an association of isotretinoin administration and depression and with suicide in a subgroup of vulnerable individuals.<ref name=Bremner2012rev>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bremner JD, Shearer KD, McCaffery PJ | title = Retinoic acid and affective disorders: the evidence for an association | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 73 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–50 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 21903028 | pmc = 3276716 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.10r05993 | type = Systematic Review }}</ref> Following this systematic review, in a 2014 review a group of Australian dermatologists and psychiatrists collaborated on a set of recommendations for safe prescribing of isotretinoin.<ref name=Rowe2014>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rowe C, Spelman L, Oziemski M, Ryan A, Manoharan S, Wilson P, Daubney M, Scott J | title = Isotretinoin and mental health in adolescents: Australian consensus | journal = The Australasian Journal of Dermatology | volume = 55 | issue = 2 | pages = 162–7 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24283385 | doi = 10.1111/ajd.12117 | type = Review }}</ref> However, whether isotretinoin use is causally associated with mental illness remains controversial.<ref name=Rowe2014/> In a survey published in February 2015, 37% of 591 dermatologists stated that they believe that isotretinoin may cause psychiatric disturbances.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nagler|first=Arielle R.|last2=Orlow|first2=Seth J.|date=2015-02-01|title=Dermatologists' attitudes, prescription, and counseling patterns for isotretinoin: a questionnaire-based study|journal=Journal of drugs in dermatology: JDD|volume=14|issue=2|pages=184–189|issn=1545-9616|pmid=25689814}}</ref>

Evidence for depression being causally associated with isotretinoin use includes 41 reports of positive [[Challenge–dechallenge–rechallenge|challenge/dechallenge/rechallenge]] with isotretinoin, involving administering isotretinoin, withdrawing the drug and then re-administering it.<ref name=Bremner2012rev/> The majority of these cases had no psychiatric history.<ref name=Bremner2012rev/>  Bremner et al. state that "these examples of depression resulting from isotretinoin use ... make for a very strong case for their link in some individuals."<ref name=Bremner2012rev/> There is also a temporal relationship between development of depression and initiation of isotretinoin treatment, with most cases developing after 1–2 months of treatment.<ref name=Bremner2012rev/> Further, higher doses of isotretinoin increases the risk of developing depression, with 25% of patients showing depression on a dose of 3&nbsp;mg/kg/day as compared with 3-4% at normal doses.<ref name=Bremner2012rev/>

Rarely, [[Irritability|irritable mood]] and [[aggression]] have been reported during isotretinoin use.<ref name=Bremner2012rev/><ref>{{cite journal| last1 = Byrne | first1 = Alan | last2 = Costello | first2 = Morgan | last3 = Greene | first3 = Elaine | last4 = Zibin | first4 = Terry | name-list-format = vanc | date = 1998-06-01 | title = Isotretinoin therapy and depression – evidence for an association | url = https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/irish-journal-of-psychological-medicine/article/isotretinoin-therapy-and-depression-evidence-for-an-association/ABC58BFCB08BF65B541670BC118AA727 | journal = Irish Journal of Psychological Medicine | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 58–60 | doi = 10.1017/S0790966700003530 }}</ref><ref name=Kontaxakis2009rev>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kontaxakis VP, Skourides D, Ferentinos P, Havaki-Kontaxaki BJ, Papadimitriou GN | title = Isotretinoin and psychopathology: a review | journal = Annals of General Psychiatry | volume = 8 | pages = 2 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19154613 | pmc = 2637283 | doi = 10.1186/1744-859X-8-2 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1744-859X-8-2 }}</ref><ref name=Borovaya2013rev>{{cite journal | vauthors = Borovaya A, Olisova O, Ruzicka T, Sárdy M | title = Does isotretinoin therapy of acne cure or cause depression? | journal = International Journal of Dermatology | volume = 52 | issue = 9 | pages = 1040–52 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23962262 | doi = 10.1111/ijd.12169 }}</ref>

Some research studies emphasise the potential for positive behavioural outcomes of isotretinoin treatment associated with its efficacy in treating acne and subsequent improvements in self-esteem. However, such studies are unable to support the conclusion that acne results in clinical depression, nor that isotretinoin treatment leads to an improvement in clinical measures of depression and/or anxiety.<ref name=Bremner2012rev/> Many of the studies cited to support the existence of a relationship between isotretinoin treatment and decreased symptoms of depression and/or anxiety have significant methodological flaws. For instance, one of the most commonly cited studies<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gupta|first=M. A.|last2=Gupta|first2=A. K.|last3=Schork|first3=N. J.|last4=Ellis|first4=C. N.|last5=Voorhees|first5=J.

==== Biological basis ====
A possible biological basis for the case reports of depression involves decreased metabolism in the [[orbitofrontal cortex]] (OFC) of the [[frontal lobe]].<ref name=Bremner2012rev/>

Studies in mice and rats have found that retinoids, including isotretinoin, bind to [[Dopamine receptor|dopaminergic receptors]] in the central nervous system.<ref name=Kontaxakis2009rev/><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Magin|first=Parker|last2=Pond|first2=Dimity|last3=Smith|first3=Wayne|date=2005-02-01|title=Isotretinoin, depression and suicide: a review of the evidence|url=http://bjgp.org/content/55/511/134|journal=Br J Gen Pract|language=en|volume=55|issue=511|pages=134–138|issn=0960-1643|pmc=1463189|pmid=15720936}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hong Ng|first=Chee|last2=Schweitzer|first2=Isaac|date=2003-02-01|title=The Association Between Depression and Isotretinoin Use in Acne|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1440-1614.2003.01111.x|journal=Australian & New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry|language=en|volume=37|issue=1|pages=78–84|doi=10.1046/j.1440-1614.2003.01111.x|pmid=12534661}}</ref> Isotretinoin may affect dopaminergic [[neurotransmission]] by disrupting the structure of dopamine receptors and decreasing dopaminergic activity.<ref name=Borovaya2013rev /> The dopaminergic system is implicated in numerous psychological disorders, including depression. Isotretinoin is also thought to affect the [[Serotonin|serotonergic]] system - it increases expression of [[5-HT1A receptor|5-HT<sub>1A</sub>&nbsp;receptors]] in the pre-synaptic neuron, which inhibit serotonin secretion.<ref name=Borovaya2013rev/> Isotretinoin also directly and indirectly increases the translation of the [[Serotonin transporter|serotonin transporter protein]], leading to increased [[reuptake]] and consequently reduced synaptic availability of serotonin.<ref name=Borovaya2013rev/>

Inhibition of [[Hippocampus|hippocampal]] [[neurogenesis]] may also play a role in the development of isotretinoin-induced depression.<ref name=Bremner2012rev/>  A further effect of isotretinoin on the brain involves retinoic acid function in the [[hypothalamus]], the hormone regulatory centre of the brain and part of the [[Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis|hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis]], a key part of the body's stress response.<ref name=Bremner2012rev/> Other brain regions regulated by [[retinoic acid]] and potentially disrupted by isotretinoin include the [[Frontal lobe|frontal cortex]] and the [[striatum]].<ref name=Bremner2012rev/>

=== Musculoskeletal ===
Isotretinoin has a number of [[Human musculoskeletal system|muscoloskeletal]] effects. [[Myalgia]] (muscular pain) and [[arthralgia]] (joint pain) are very common side effects.<ref name="Brelsford_2008">{{cite journal | vauthors = Brelsford M, Beute TC | title = Preventing and managing the side effects of isotretinoin | journal = Seminars in Cutaneous Medicine and Surgery | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 197–206 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18786498 | doi = 10.1016/j.sder.2008.07.002 }}</ref>  [[Retinoid]]s, including isotretinoin, are well-known to cause bone changes, the most common type of which is [[Hyperostosis|hyperostotic changes]] (excessive bone growth), especially in growing children and adolescents.<ref name="Brelsford_2008" /> Other problems include premature [[Epiphyseal plate|epiphyseal closure]] and [[calcification]] of tendons and ligaments.<ref name="Brelsford_2008" /> The bones of the spine and feet are most commonly affected. Risk factors for skeletal effects include older age, greater dosage and longer course of treatment. Most bone changes cause no symptoms and may only be noticed using [[X-ray|X-ray imaging]].<ref name="Brelsford_2008" />

=== Gastrointestinal ===
Isotretinoin may cause non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, diarrhoea and abdominal pain.<ref name=Brelsford2008rev/> The drug is associated with [[inflammatory bowel disease]] (IBD) -  [[ulcerative colitis]], but not Crohn's disease.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crockett|first=Seth D.|last2=Porter|first2=Carol Q.|last3=Martin|first3=Christopher F.|last4=Sandler|first4=Robert S.|last5=Kappelman|first5=Michael D.|date=2017-05-06|title=Isotretinoin Use and the Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Case Control Study|journal=The American journal of gastroenterology|volume=105|issue=9|pages=1986–1993|doi=10.1038/ajg.2010.124|issn=0002-9270|pmc=3073620|pmid=20354506}}</ref> There are also reports of patients developing [[Irritable bowel syndrome|Irritable Bowel Syndrome]] (IBS) and worsening of existing IBS.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lowenstein|first=Elie B.|last2=Lowenstein|first2=Eve J.|title=Isotretinoin systemic therapy and the shadow cast upon dermatology's downtrodden hero|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0738081X11002306|journal=Clinics in Dermatology|volume=29|issue=6|pages=652–661|doi=10.1016/j.clindermatol.2011.08.026}}</ref>

=== Ocular ===
Isotretinoin and other retinoids are well known to affect the eyes. [[Dry eye syndrome|Dry eyes]] are very common during treatment and is caused by isotretinoin's apoptotic effect on the [[meibomian gland]]s. Some patients develop contact lens intolerance as a result.<ref name=Brelsford2008rev/> In some patients, these changes are long-lasting or irreversible and represent [[Meibomian gland dysfunction|Meibomian Gland Dysfunction]] (MGD).<ref name=Moy2015rev/> Other common effects on the eyes include inflammation of the eyelid ([[blepharitis]]), red eye caused by [[conjunctivitis]] and irritation of the eye. More rare ocular side effects include blurred vision, decreased night vision (which may be permanent), [[Color blindness|colour blindness]], development of corneal opacities, inflammation of the cornea ([[keratitis]]), swelling of the optic disk ([[Papilledema|papilloedema]], associated with [[Idiopathic intracranial hypertension|IIH]]), [[photophobia]] and other visual disturbances.<ref name=UKLabel2015>{{cite web|title=Roaccutane 20mg Soft Capsules - Summary of Product Characteristics|url=https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/21511|publisher=UK Electronic Medicines Compendium|language=en|date=1 July 2015}}</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==
Isotretinoin's exact [[mechanism of action]] is unknown, but several studies have shown that isotretinoin induces [[apoptosis]] (programmatic cell death) in various cells in the body.

Isotretinoin is primarily (99.9%) bound to plasma proteins, mostly [[albumin]]. Three metabolites of Isotretinoin are detectable in human plasma after oral administration: 4-''oxo''-isotretinoin, retinoid acid (tretinoin), and 4-''oxo''-retinoic acid (4-''oxo''-tretinoin). Isotretinoin also oxidizes, irreversibly, to 4-''oxo''-isotretinoin—which forms its geometric isomer 4-''oxo''-tretinoin.

== History ==
The compound 13-cis retinoic acid was first studied in the 1960s at Roche Laboratories in Switzerland by Werner Bollag as a treatment for skin cancer.  Experiments completed in 1971 showed that the compound was likely to be ineffective for cancer and, surprisingly, that it could be useful to treat acne.  However, they also showed that the compound was likely to cause birth defects, so in light of the events around  [[thalidomide]], Roche abandoned the product. In 1975, Gary Peck and Frank Yoder independently rediscovered the drug's use as a treatment of cystic acne while studying it as a treatment for [[lamellar ichthyosis]], and published that work.  Roche resumed work on the drug. In clinical trials, subjects were carefully screened to avoid including women who were or might become pregnant.  Roche's [[New Drug Application]] for isotretinoin for the treatment of acne included data showing that the drug caused birth defects in rabbits. The FDA approved the application in 1982.

Scientists involved in the clinical trials published articles warning of birth defects at the same time the drug was launched in the US, but nonetheless isotretinoin was taken up quickly and widely, both among dermatologists and general practitioners. Cases of birth defects showed up in the first year, leading the FDA to begin publishing case reports and to Roche sending warning letters to doctors and placing warning stickers on drug bottles, and including stronger warnings on the label.  Lawsuits against Roche started to be filed.  In 1983 the FDA's advisory committee was convened and recommended stronger measures, which the FDA took and were that time unprecedented: warning blood banks not to accept blood from people taking the drug, and adding a warning to the label advising women to start taking contraceptives a month before starting the drug.   However use of the drug continued to grow, as did the number of babies born with birth defects.  In 1985 the label was updated to include a [[boxed warning]].  In early 1988 the FDA called for another advisory committee, and FDA employees prepared an internal memo estimating that around 1,000 babies had been born with birth defects due isotretinoin, that up to around 1,000 miscarriages had been caused, and that between 5,000 and 7,000 women had had abortions due to isotretinoin.  The memo was leaked to the New York Times<ref>Gina Kolata for the New York Times. April 22, 1988 [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/22/us/anti-acne-drug-faulted-in-birth-defects.html?pagewanted=all Anti-Acne Drug Faulted in Birth]</ref> a few days before the meeting, leading to a storm of media attention.  In the committee meeting, dermatologists and Roche each argued to keep the drug on the market but to increase education efforts; pediatricians and the CDC argued to withdraw the drug from the market.  The committee recommended to restrict physicians who could prescribe the drug and to require a second opinion before it could be prescribed.  The FDA, believing it did not have authority under the law to restrict who had the right to prescribe the drug, kept the drug on the market but took further unprecedented measures: it required to Roche to make warnings yet more visible and graphic, provide doctors with [[informed consent]] forms to be used when prescribing the drug, and to conduct follow up studies to test whether the measures were reducing exposure of pregnant women to the drug.  Roche implemented those measures, and offered to pay for contraception counseling and pregnancy testing for women prescribed the drug - the program was called the "Pregnancy Prevention Program".

A CDC report published in 2000<ref>CDC. January 21, 2000 [https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4902a2.htm Accutane®-Exposed Pregnancies -- California, 1999] MMWR Weekly 49(02);28-31</ref> showed problems with the Pregnancy Prevention Program and showed that the increase in prescriptions was from off-label use, and prompted Roche to revamp its program, renaming it the "Targeted Pregnancy Prevention Program" and adding label changes like requirements for two pregnancy tests, two kinds of contraception, and for doctors to provide pharmacists with prescriptions directly; providing additional educational materials, and providing free pregnancy tests. The FDA had another advisory meeting in late 2000 that again debated how to prevent pregnant women from being exposed to the drug; dermatologists testified about the remarkable efficacy of the drug, the psychological impact of acne, and demanded autonomy to prescribe the drug; others argued that the drug be withdrawn or much stricter measures be taken.  In 2001 the FDA announced a new regulatory scheme called SMART (the System to Manage Accutane Related Teratogenicity) that required Roche to provide defined training materials to doctors, and for doctors to sign and return a letter to Roche acknowledging that they had reviewed the training materials, for Roche to then send stickers to doctors, which doctors would have to place on prescriptions they give patients after they have confirmed a negative pregnancy test; prescriptions could only be written for 30 days and could not be renewed, thus requiring a new pregnancy test for each prescription.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

In February 2002, Roche's patents for isotretinoin expired, and there are now many other companies selling cheaper generic versions of the drug. On June 29, 2009, [[Roche Pharmaceuticals]], the original creator and distributor of isotretinoin, officially discontinued both the manufacture and distribution of their '''Accutane''' brand in the [[United States]] due to what the company described as business reasons related to low market share (below 5%), coupled with the high cost of defending personal-injury lawsuits brought by some patients prescribed the drug.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-sci-accutane7-2009nov07-story.html#page=1 | publisher = [[LA Times]] | title = New study may deal final blow to acne drug Accutane |date=7 November 2009 | author = Shari Roan}}</ref> Generic isotretinoin will remain available in the United States through various manufacturers.

Several trials over inflammatory bowel disease claims have been held in the United States thus far, with many of them resulting in multimillion-dollar judgments against the makers of isotretinoin.<ref>{{cite news |author = Voreacos D |date=May 30, 2007 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/29/AR2007052901946.html |title=Roche Found Liable in First Of 400 Suits Over Accutane |agency=Bloomberg News |accessdate=April 30, 2012 |work=The Washington Post}}</ref>
