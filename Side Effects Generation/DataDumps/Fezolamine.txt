'''Fezolamine''' ('''Win-41,528-2''') is a [[drug]] which was investigated by [[Sterling Drug]] as an [[antidepressant]] in the 1980s.<ref>{{US Patent|4182895}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jm00380a020| pmid = 3968690| title = 3,4-Diphenyl-1H-pyrazole-1-propanamine antidepressants| journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry| volume = 28| issue = 2| pages = 256–60| year = 1985| last1 = Bailey | first1 = D.

It acts as a [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[dopamine]] [[reuptake inhibitor]], with 3- to 4-fold preference for the former [[neurotransmitter]].<ref>{{Cite journal
