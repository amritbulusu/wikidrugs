'''Parathyroid hormone '''('''PTH'''), also called '''parathormone''' or '''parathyrin''', is a [[hormone]] secreted by the [[parathyroid gland]]s that is important in [[bone remodeling]], which is an ongoing process in which [[bone tissue]] is alternately [[bone resorption|resorbed]] and [[ossification|rebuilt]] over time.  PTH is secreted in response to low blood serum [[calcium]] (Ca2+) levels.  PTH indirectly stimulates [[osteoclast]] activity within [[bone marrow]], in an effort to release more ionic calcium (Ca2+) into the blood to elevate serum [[calcium]] (Ca2+) levels.  The [[bone]]s act as a (metaphorical) "[[bank]] of [[calcium]]" from which the body can make "withdrawals" as needed to keep [[calcium in biology#Measurement|the amount of calcium in the blood]] at appropriate [[concentration|levels]] despite the ever-present challenges of [[metabolism]], [[stress (biology)|stress]], and [[nutrition]]al variations. PTH is "a key that unlocks the bank vault" to remove the calcium. In consequence, PTH is vital to [[health]], and health problems that yield too little or too much PTH (such as [[hypoparathyroidism]], [[hyperparathyroidism]], or [[paraneoplastic syndrome]]s) can wreak havoc in the form of [[bone disease]], [[hypocalcaemia]], and [[hypercalcaemia]].

PTH is secreted by the [[parathyroid chief cell|chief cells]] of the parathyroid glands as a [[polypeptide]] containing 84 [[amino acids]], which is a [[prohormone]]; effective hormone-receptor interaction requires solely the 34-N-terminal amino acids.  While PTH acts to increase the concentration of ionic [[calcium]] (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) in the [[blood]], [[calcitonin]], a hormone produced by the [[parafollicular cells]] (C cells) of the [[thyroid gland]], acts to decrease ionic calcium concentration. PTH essentially acts to increase the concentration of calcium in the blood by acting upon the [[parathyroid hormone 1 receptor]], which is present at high levels in bone and kidney, and the [[parathyroid hormone 2 receptor]], which is present at high levels in the central nervous system, pancreas, testis, and placenta.<ref>{{GeorgiaPhysiology|5/5ch6/s5ch6_11}}</ref> PTH half-life is approximately 4 minutes.<ref name="pmid12324490">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bieglmayer C, Prager G, Niederle B | title = Kinetic analyses of parathyroid hormone clearance as measured by three rapid immunoassays during parathyroidectomy | journal = Clinical Chemistry | volume = 48 | issue = 10 | pages = 1731–8 | date = Oct 2002 | pmid = 12324490 | doi =  | url = http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/content/abstract/48/10/1731 }}</ref> It has a molecular mass of approximately 9500 [[Dalton (unit)|Da]].<ref name="pmid4509319">{{cite journal | vauthors = Brewer HB, Fairwell T, Ronan R, Sizemore GW, Arnaud CD | title = Human parathyroid hormone: amino-acid sequence of the amino-terminal residues 1-34 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 69 | issue = 12 | pages = 3585–8 | year = 1972 | pmid = 4509319 | pmc = 389826 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.69.12.3585}}</ref>

Stimulation is indirect since osteoclasts do not have a receptor for PTH; rather, PTH binds to [[osteoblast]]s, the cells responsible for creating bone. Binding stimulates osteoblasts to increase their expression of RANKL and inhibits their secretion of [[Osteoprotegerin]] (OPG). Free OPG competitively binds to [[RANKL]] as a decoy receptor, preventing RANKL from interacting with RANK, a receptor for RANKL. The binding of RANKL to [[RANK]] (facilitated by the decreased amount of OPG available for binding the excess RANKL) stimulates these osteoclast precursors to fuse, forming new osteoclasts, which ultimately enhances [[bone resorption]]. Another mechanism to regulate this pathways as PTH does is by estrogen. Estrogen suppresses T cell TNF production by regulating T cell differentiation and activity in the bone marrow, thymus, and peripheral lymphoid organs. In the bone marrow, estrogen downregulates the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells through an IL-7 dependent mechanism.<ref name="pmid12633785">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bord S, Ireland DC, Beavan SR, Compston JE | title = The effects of estrogen on osteoprotegerin, RANKL, and estrogen receptor expression in human osteoblasts | journal = Bone | volume = 32 | issue = 2 | pages = 136–41 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12633785 | doi = 10.1016/S8756-3282(02)00953-5 }}</ref>

In the kidney, approximately 250&nbsp;mmol of calcium ions are filtered into the [[glomerular filtrate]] per day. Most of this (245&nbsp;mmol/d) is reabsorbed from the tubular fluid, leaving about 5&nbsp;mmol/d to be excreted in the urine.

The main determinant of the amount of calcium excreted into the urine per day is the plasma ionized calcium concentration itself. The plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration only increases or decreases the amount of calcium excreted at any ''specified plasma ionized calcium concentration''. Thus, in primary [[hyperparathyroidism]] the quantity of calcium excreted in the urine per day is ''increased'' despite the high levels of PTH in the blood. This is because hyperparathyroidism results in [[hypercalcemia]], which increases the urinary calcium concentration ([[hypercalcuria]]) despite the moderately increased rate of calcium re-absorption from the renal tubular fluid caused by PTH's direct effect on those tubules. [[Renal stones]] are therefore often a first indication of hyperparathyroidism, especially since the hypercalcuria is accompanied by an increase in urinary phosphate excretion (a direct result of the high plasma PTH levels). Together the calcium and phosphate tend to precipitate out as water-insoluble salts, which readily  form solid “stones”.<ref name="pmid25287933" /><ref name=Harrison>{{cite book | last1 = Harrison | first1 = T.R. | last2 = Adams | first2 = R.D. | last3 = Bennett | first3 = I.L. | last4 = Resnick | first4 = W.H. | last5 = Thorn | first5 = G.W. | last6 = Wintrobe | first6 = M.M. | name-list-format = vanc | title = Principles of Internal Medicine | edition = Third | date = 1958 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Book Company | location = New York | pages = 575–578 | chapter = Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.parathyroid.com/parathyroid-symptoms.htm | title = Symptoms of Hyperparathyroidism and Symptoms of Parathyroid Disease. | work = Parathyroid.com | publisher = Norman Parathyroid Center | access-date = 2015-12-30 }}</ref> |group=nb}}). A more important effect of PTH on the kidney is, however, its inhibition of the reabsorption of [[phosphate]] (HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>) from the tubular fluid, resulting in a decrease in the plasma phosphate concentration.

In the intestine, via kidney, PTH enhances the absorption of calcium in the [[intestine]] by increasing the production of activated [[vitamin D]]. Vitamin D activation occurs in the kidney. PTH up-regulates [[25-hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-hydroxylase|25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> 1-alpha-hydroxylase]], the enzyme responsible for 1-alpha [[hydroxylation]] of [[25-hydroxy vitamin D]], converting vitamin D to its active form ([[1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D]]). This activated form of vitamin D increases the absorption of calcium (as Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions) by the intestine via [[calbindin]].

PTH was one of the first hormones to be shown to use the G-protein, [[adenylyl cyclase]] second messenger system.

=== Regulation of serum phosphate ===

PTH reduces the reabsorption of [[phosphate]] from the [[proximal tubule]] of the [[kidney]],<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Gardner | first1 = David | first2 = Dolores | last2 = Shoback | name-list-format = vanc | page = 232 | title = Greenspan's Basic & Clinical Endocrinology | year=2011 | location = | publisher = McGraw Hill | isbn = 978-0-07-162243-1 | edition = 9th }}</ref> which means more phosphate is excreted through the urine.

However, PTH enhances the uptake of phosphate from the intestine and bones into the blood. In the bone, slightly more calcium than phosphate is released from the breakdown of bone. In the intestines, absorption of both calcium and phosphate is mediated by an increase in activated vitamin D. The absorption of phosphate is not as dependent on vitamin D as is that of calcium. The end result of PTH release is a small net drop in the serum concentration of phosphate.

=== Vitamin D synthesis ===

PTH increases the activity of [[1-α-hydroxylase]] enzyme, which converts 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, the major circulating form of inactive vitamin D, into 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, the active form of [[vitamin D]], in the [[kidney]].

== Regulation of PTH secretion ==

Secretion of parathyroid hormone is determined chiefly by [[blood plasma|serum]] ionized calcium concentration through [[feedback inhibition|negative feedback]]. Parathyroid cells express [[calcium-sensing receptor]]s on the cell surface. PTH is secreted when [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] is decreased (Calcitonin is secreted when serum calcium levels are elevated). The G-protein coupled calcium receptors bind extracellular calcium and may be found on the surface on a wide variety of cells distributed in the [[brain]], [[heart]], [[skin]], [[stomach]], C cells, and other tissues.  In the parathyroid gland, high concentrations of extracellular calcium result in activation of the Gq G-protein coupled cascade through the action of [[phospholipase C]].  This hydrolyzes [[phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate]] (PIP2) to liberate intracellular messengers [[Inositol trisphosphate|IP3]] and [[diacylglycerol]] (DAG).  Ultimately, these two messengers result in a release of calcium from intracellular stores into the cytoplasmic space.  Hence a high extracellular calcium concentration leads to an increase in the cytoplasmic calcium concentration.  In contrast to the mechanism that most secretory cells use, this high cytoplasmic calcium concentration inhibits the fusion of vesicles containing granules of preformed PTH with the membrane of the parathyroid cell, and thus inhibits release of PTH.

In the parathyroids, magnesium serves this role in stimulus-secretion coupling. A mild decrease in serum magnesium levels stimulates the resorptive activity PTH has on the kidneys. Severe [[hypomagnesemia]] inhibits PTH secretion and also causes resistance to PTH, leading to a form of hypoparathyroidism that is reversible.<ref name="pmid10405219">{{cite journal | vauthors = Agus ZS | title = Hypomagnesemia | journal = Journal of the American Society of Nephrology | volume = 10 | issue = 7 | pages = 1616–22 | date = Jul 1999 | pmid = 10405219 | doi =  | url = http://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/10/7/1616.full }}</ref>

=== Stimulators ===

* Decreased serum [Ca<sup>2+</sup>].
* Mild decreases in serum [Mg<sup>2+</sup>].
* An increase in serum phosphate (increased phosphate causes it to complex with serum calcium,  forming calcium phosphate, which reduces stimulation of Ca-sensitive receptors (CaSr) that do not sense calcium phosphate, triggering an increase in PTH).

=== Inhibitors ===

* Increased serum [Ca<sup>2+</sup>].
* Severe decreases in serum [Mg<sup>2+</sup>], which also produces symptoms of [[hypoparathyroidism]] (such as [[hypocalcemia]]).<ref name=brs>{{cite book | last = Costanzo | first = Linda S. | authorlink =  | title = BRS Physiology | publisher = Lippincott, Williams, & Wilkins | year = 2007 | location =  | pages = 260 | url = https://www.amazon.com/Physiology-Board-Review-Linda-Costanzo/dp/0781773113/ | doi =  | id =  | isbn = 978-0-7817-7311-9 }}</ref>

== Clinical significance ==

[[Hyperparathyroidism]], the presence of excessive amounts of parathyroid hormone in the blood, occurs in two very distinct sets of circumstances. Primary hyperparathyroidism is due to autonomous, abnormal hypersecretion of PTH from the parathyroid gland, while [[secondary hyperparathyroidism]] is an appropriately high PTH level seen as a physiological response to [[hypocalcaemia]]. A low level of PTH in the blood is known as  [[hypoparathyroidism]] and is most commonly due to damage to or removal of parathyroid glands during thyroid surgery.

There are a number of rare but well-described genetic conditions affecting parathyroid hormone metabolism, including [[pseudohypoparathyroidism]], [[familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia]], and autosomal dominant hypercalciuric hypocalcemia. Of note, PTH is unchanged in [[pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism]]. In [[Osteoporosis|osteoporotic]] women, administration of an exogenous parathyroid hormone analogue ([[teriparatide]], by daily injection) superimposed on estrogen therapy produced increases in bone mass and reduced vertebral and nonvertebral fractures by 45 to 65%.<ref name="pmid11346808">{{cite journal | vauthors = Neer RM, Arnaud CD, Zanchetta JR, Prince R, Gaich GA, Reginster JY, Hodsman AB, Eriksen EF, Ish-Shalom S, Genant HK, Wang O, Mitlak BH | title = Effect of parathyroid hormone (1-34) on fractures and bone mineral density in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 344 | issue = 19 | pages = 1434–41 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 11346808 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200105103441904 }}</ref>

PTH can be measured in the blood in several different forms: intact PTH; N-terminal PTH; mid-molecule PTH, and C-terminal PTH, and different tests are used in different clinical situations.
