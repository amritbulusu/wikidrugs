*Sparfloxacin achieves a high degree of penetration into most tissues, except for the central nervous system.
*Following a single 400&nbsp;mg oral dose of sparfloxacin, the mean peak concentration in cantharides-induced inflammatory fluid is 1.3 lA-g per ml after a mean duration of 5 h post-dose. Thus, overall sparfloxacin penetration into inflammatory fluid is 117% and the mean elimination half-life from this fluid is 19.7 h.<ref name="pmid1336947">{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnson JH, Cooper MA, Andrews JM, Wise R |title=Pharmacokinetics and inflammatory fluid penetration of sparfloxacin |journal=Antimicrob.

Shimada et al. ( 1993) has summarized many of the studies published in Japanese regarding the tissue distribution of sparfloxacin. (high concentrations are achieved in sputum, pleural fluid, skin, lung, prostate, gynecological tissues, breast milk and otolaryngological tissues. *Salivary concentrations are 66-70% of plasma levels, while CSF penetration appears to be somewhat limited with CSF:plasma concentration ratios of only 0.25-0.35.
*Sparfloxacin achieves concentrations in bile and gallbladder of 7.1- to 83-fold the concurrent serum levels.
In rabbits, sparfloxacin achieves very good penetration into the ocular vitreous (54%), cornea (76%) and lens (36%).<ref>{{Cite journal

==Adverse drug reactions==
{{See also|Quinolone#Adverse effects}}
*In a review of 2081 adult patients participating in a Phase III clinical trial of sparfloxacin in community-acquired, lower respiratory tract infections, sparfloxacin (200- or 400&nbsp;mg loading dose then 100 or 200&nbsp;mg daily; i.e. 200/100&nbsp;mg and 400/200&nbsp;mg) had a similar incidence of adverse events as the comparator agents (Rubinstein, 1996). The overall rates of drug-related adverse reactions for sparfloxacin 400/200&nbsp;mg versus comparators and 200/100&nbsp;mg versus the comparator (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) were 13.7 versus 17.7%, and 9.5 versus 13.2%, respectively. However, many of these reported reactions were very minor; discontinua- tion of the antibacterial agent because of drug-related adverse reactions occurred in 1.6 versus 1.6%, and 1) versus 1.1%, respectively. Adverse reactions affecting the nervous system were reported in 5.7% of the sparfloxacin group, with insomnia and other sleep disorders the most common events.
*Phototoxicity was noted in 2.0% of sparfloxacin recipients, with the average delay in onset being 6.3 :t<!--±?--> 4.5 days (range 1&ndash;14 days) after commencing sparfloxacin. Mostly this consisted of erythema on the face and hands which lasted an average of 6.4 :t<!--±?--> 4.2 days. The incidence of phototoxicity associated with sparfloxacin appears to be higher than that observed with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin but less than that reported for fleroxacin, pefloxacin, enoxacin and nalidixic acid.
*Most importantly, features of the hemolytic-uremic syndrome such as that associated with temafloxacin<ref>(p.&nbsp;II44){{Clarify|date=June 2011}}<!--citation details needed--></ref> have not been reported.<ref>Ramsay and Obershkova, 1974{{Clarify|date=June 2011}}<!--citation details needed--></ref><ref>Bowie et al., 1989{{Clarify|date=June 2011}}<!--citation details needed--></ref><ref>Davey, 1989{{Clarify|date=June 2011}}<!--citation details needed--></ref><ref>Wolfson and Hooper, 1991{{Clarify|date=June 2011}}<!--citation details needed--></ref><ref>{{Cite journal

==Mechanism of action==
Sparfloxacin, like other [[quinolones]] and [[fluoroquinolones]], are bactericidal drugs, actively killing bacteria. Quinolones inhibit the bacterial DNA [[gyrase]] or the [[topoisomerase IV]] enzyme, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and transcription. Quinolones can enter cells easily and therefore are often used to treat intracellular pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. For many gram-negative bacteria DNA gyrase is the target, whereas topoisomerase IV is the target for many gram-positive bacteria. Eukaryotic cells do not contain DNA [[gyrase]] or [[topoisomerase IV]].
