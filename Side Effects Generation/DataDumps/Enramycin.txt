'''Enramycin''' or '''Enduracidin''' is a [[polypeptide antibiotic]] produced by ''[[Streptomyces fungicidus]]''. Enramycin is widely used as a feed additive for pigs and chickens to prevent necrotic enteritis induced by [[Gram positive|Gram-positive]] gut pathogens.<ref>Schering-Plough. "Enramycin." Darou Gostar Group. N.p., n.d. Web. 13 Mar. 2014.</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==
Enramycin acts as an inhibitor of the enzyme, MurG, which is essential for [[Cell wall#Bacterial cell walls|cell wall]] biosynthesis in [[Gram positive|Gram-positive]] bacteria. MurG catalyzes the transglycosylation reaction in the last step of [[peptidoglycan]] biosynthesis. Inhibiting this step greatly compromises cell wall integrity leading to cell lysis.<ref>{{Cite journal

== Spectrum of susceptibility ==
Enramycin has been found to be very effective against [[Gram positive|Gram-positive]] gut pathogens, most notably, ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]''; a leading cause of necrotic enteritis.{{Citation needed|reason="leading cause" claim not found in toku-e.com reference below|date=May 2017}} The following represents MIC data for a couple of veterinary pathogens.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toku-e.com/Assets/MIC/Enramycin.pdf |title=Enramycin Susceptibilty and Resistance Data}}</ref>
* ''Clostridium perfringens'': 0.05 μg/ml – 1.6 μg/ml
* ''Staphylococcus aureus'': 0.013 μg/ml – 0.413 μg/ml

== Composition ==
Standard grade enramycin is composed of two main components called enramycin A and enramycin B. These two components are routinely used as analytical reference standards; however, their activity as individual compounds does not appear to be widely studied or characterized.<ref>{{Cite journal
