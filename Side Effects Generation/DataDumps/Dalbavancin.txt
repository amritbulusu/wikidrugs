'''Dalbavancin''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], trade names '''Dalvance''' in the US and '''Xydalba''' in Europe) is a novel second-generation [[glycopeptide antibiotic|lipoglycopeptide]] [[antibiotic]]. It belongs to the same class as [[vancomycin]], the most widely used and one of the few treatments available to patients infected with [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA).<ref>[http://www.drugs.com/nda/dalbavancin_041221.html Vicuron Pharmaceuticals Submits New Drug Application for Dalbavancin to U.S. Food and Drug Administration]</ref>

The [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved dalbavancin in May 2014 for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs) caused by certain susceptible bacteria such as ''Staphylococcus aureus'' including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains of ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'', in intravenous dosage form.<ref>[http://www.pharmacistspharmajournal.org/2014/05/us-fda-approves-novel-lipoglycopeptide.html US FDA approves drug Dalvance containing Dalbavancin]</ref>

==Medical uses==
Dalbavancin is an antibiotic used to treat acute bacterial [[skin and skin structure infection]]s (ABSSSI) in adults caused by susceptible Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (MRSA).  MRSA infections have become problematic in the community and in healthcare settings due to resistance to many available antibiotics.<ref>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - Methicillin-Resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (MRSA) infections. https://www.cdc.gov/mrsa/</ref>  Because dalbavancin has demonstrated efficacy against MRSA and other microorganisms to treat serious or life-threatening infections, it was the first drug approved as a [[Qualified Infectious Disease Product]] under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) act, which is part of the FDA Safety and Innovation Act.<ref name="rph">Dalbavancin: First I.V. antibiotic for acute bacterial skin infections. http://www.pharmacist.com/dalbavancin-first-iv-antibiotic-acute-bacterial-skin-infections</ref>

It has strong activity against many Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'', ''Streptococcus pyogenes'', ''Streptococcus agalactiae'', ''Streptococcus anginosus'', ''Streptococcus intermedius'', and ''Streptococcus constellatus.''<ref name="pi">Dalvance (dalbavancin) for injection Full Prescribing Information. http://content.stockpr.com/duratatherapeutics/files/docs/Dalvance+APPROVED+USPI.PDF
</ref>  Based on MIC data and other studies, dalbavancin is more potent and bactericidal and therefore requires lower concentrations than vancomycin against these organisms.<ref name="nih">Bennet JW, Lewis JS, Ellis MW (2008).

Two trials, DISCOVER 1 and DISCOVER 2, demonstrated noninferiority of dalbavancin compared to vancomycin/linezolid in the treatment of ABSSSI.  Patients were randomly assigned to receive two doses of dalbavancin on days 1 and 8, or to receive intravenous vancomyin for at least 3 days with the option of switching to oral linezolid to complete 10 to 14 days of therapy.  Investigators assessed the cessation of spread of infection-related erythema and the absence of fever at 48 to 72 hours as the primary endpoint and found that once-weekly dalbavancin was as effective as twice-daily intravenous vancomycin followed by oral linezolid.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Boucher | first1 = HW | last2 = Wilcox | first2 = M | last3 = Talbot | first3 = GH | last4 = Puttagunta | first4 = S | last5 = Das | first5 = AF | last6 = Dunne | first6 = MW | year = 2014 | title = Once-Weekly Dalbavancin versus Daily Conventional Therapy for Skin Infection | url = | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 370 | issue = | pages = 2169–2179 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1310480 | pmid=24897082}}</ref>  This once-weekly dosing regimen may offer an advantageous treatment option compared to daily or twice-daily dosing.<ref name="rph" />

==Contraindications==
Dalbavancin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to dalbavancin, such as skin reactions or anaphylaxis, and caution is advised for patients with known hypersensitivity to other glycopeptides.  There is currently no data on cross-reactivity between dalbavancin and vancomyin.<ref name="pi" />

==Side effects==
The most common adverse reactions encountered in Phase II and Phase III trials were nausea (5.5%), headache (4.7%), and diarrhea (4.4%), as well as rash (2.7%) and itchiness (2.1%).  Other less frequent but serious adverse reactions included hematologic disorders, hepatotoxicity, ''Clostridium difficile'' colitis, bronchospasm, infusion-related reactions including [[Red man syndrome (Drug eruption)|Red Man Syndrome]], and anaphylactic shock.<ref name="pi" />  In trials, dalbavancin was associated with higher rates of hemorrhagic events compared to comparator groups and should be a precaution in patients undergoing surgery or taking anticoagulants.<ref name="nih" />  Patients on dalbavancin also had post-baseline alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels that were 3 times the upper normal limit, some even having elevations 10 times the upper normal limit; however, eight of the twelve dalbavancin-treated patients had comorbid conditions that could affect their ALT, compared to only one patient in the comparator group.<ref name="pi" />  There is no evidence of ototoxicity associated with dalbavancin.<ref name="fda" />

===Drug interactions===
Clinical drug-drug interactions with dalbavancin have not been studied, and dalbavancin does not appear to interact with cytochrome P450 substrates, inhibitors, or inducers. It was found to have an ''in vitro'' synergistic interaction with the antimicrobial oxacillin, but the clinical significance of this interaction has yet to be established.<ref name="pi" />

===Pregnancy and lactation===
Use of dalbavancin in pregnant women has not been studied sufficiently and should only occur when the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.  Animal studies did not show embryo or fetal toxicity at doses that were 1.2 and 0.7 times the human dose.  However, delayed fetal maturation was observed at a dose that was 3.5 times the human dose.  While dalbavancin is excreted in rat milk, it is unknown if it is excreted in human milk.  It should be used in nursing mothers only when the potential benefit exceeds the potential risk.<ref name="pi" />  There is no evidence in animals of teratogenicity.<ref name="fda" />

==Mechanism of action==
Dalbavancin is a lipoglycopeptide belonging in the same glycopeptide class as vancomycin.  Similar to other glycopeptides, dalbavancin exerts its bactericidal effect by disrupting cell wall biosynthesis.  It binds to the D-alanyl-D-alanyl residue on growing peptidoglycan chains and prevents transpeptidation from occurring, preventing peptidoglycan elongation and cell wall formation.  Dalbavancin also dimerizes and anchors itself in the lipophilic bacterial membrane, thereby increasing its stability in the target environment and its affinity for peptidoglycan.<ref name="nih" />

Antimicrobial activity correlates with the ratio of area under the concentration-time curve to minimum inhibitory concentration for ''Staphylococcus aureus''.<ref name="pi" />

==History==
Dalbavancin has undergone a phase-III clinical trial for adults with complicated skin infections, but in December 2007, the [[US Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] said more data were needed before approval.<ref name=Dec2007/> On September 9, 2008, Pfizer announced  it will withdraw all marketing applications to conduct another phase-III clinical trial.<ref>{{cite press release
