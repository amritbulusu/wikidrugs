'''Cetuximab''' is an [[epidermal growth factor receptor]] (EGFR) inhibitor used for the treatment of metastatic [[colorectal cancer]], metastatic non-small cell [[lung cancer]] and [[head and neck cancer]]. Cetuximab is a chimeric (mouse/human) [[Monoclonal antibodies|monoclonal antibody]] given by intravenous infusion that is distributed under the trade name '''Erbitux''' in the U.S. and Canada by the drug company [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] and outside the U.S. and Canada by the drug company [[Merck KGaA]]. In Japan, Merck KGaA, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Eli Lilly have a co-distribution.

In July 2009, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approved cetuximab (Erbitux) for treatment of colon cancer with wild-type [[KRAS]], since it had little or no effect in colorectal tumors harboring a [[KRAS]] mutation (this also applied to the EGFR antibody [[panitumumab]]).<ref name="urlCetuximab (Erbitux) and Panitumumab (Vectibix)">{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDER/ucm172905.htm | title = Class Labeling Changes to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies, cetuximab (Erbitux) and panitumumab (Vectibix): KRAS Mutations  | date = 2010-01-11 | work = | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration }}</ref> This was the first genetic test to guide treatment of cancer.<ref name="Messersmith_Ahnen_2008"/> In July 2012, the FDA approved a real time [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] [[companion diagnostic]] test for KRAS, the therascreen KRAS test.<ref name="urltherascreen® KRAS RGQ PCR Kit - P110030">{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/DeviceApprovalsandClearances/Recently-ApprovedDevices/ucm312055.htm | title = Therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR Kit – P110030 | date = 2012-07-06 | work = Device Approvals and Clearances | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration }}</ref>

== Medical uses ==

A diagnostic immunohistochemistry assay (EGFR pharmDx) can be used to detect EGFR expression in the tumor material. Approximately 75% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer have an EGFR-expressing tumor and are therefore considered eligible for treatment with cetuximab or [[panitumumab]], according to FDA guidelines. Unfortunately, there is evidence that immunohistochemical EGFR receptor testing does not predict response to either cetuximab or panitumumab, so that this has been called a "misleading biomarker" that has nevertheless caused insurers and even health systems to deny payment for EGFR antibody treatment for patients who lack a positive tumor EGFR histochemical test.<ref name="Messersmith_Ahnen_2008">{{cite journal | vauthors = Messersmith WA, Ahnen DJ | title = Targeting EGFR in colorectal cancer | journal = N. Engl. J. Med. | volume = 359 | issue = 17 | pages = 1834–6  | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18946069 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMe0806778 }}</ref>

=== Head and neck cancer ===

Cetuximab was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] in March 2006 for use in combination with [[radiation therapy]] for treating [[squamous cell carcinoma]] of the head and neck ([[Head and neck cancer|SCCHN]]) or as a single agent in patients who have had prior platinum-based therapy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/results/head-neck-cetuximab0604 |title=Cetuximab Beneficial in Head and Neck Cancer - National Cancer Institute |publisher=Cancer.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-04-13}}</ref>

== Side effects ==
One of the more serious side effects of cetuximab therapy is the incidence of [[acneiform rash|acne-like rash]].  This rash rarely leads to dose reductions or termination of therapy. It is generally reversible.<ref name="pmid19925924">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nguyen A, Hoang V, Laquer V, Kelly KM | title = Angiogenesis in cutaneous disease: part I | journal = J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. | volume = 61 | issue = 6 | pages = 921–42; quiz 943–4  | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19925924 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaad.2009.05.052 }}</ref>

Further severe infusion reactions include but are not limited to: fevers, chills, [[rigors]], [[urticaria]], [[pruritus|itchiness]], rash, hypotension, nausea, vomiting, headache, shortness of breath, wheezing, angioedema, dizziness, [[anaphylaxis]], and cardiac arrest.  Therefore, pretreatment with [[diphenhydramine]] 30-60 min. before administration is standard of care.  Other common side effects include photosensitivity, [[hypomagnesemia]] due to magnesium wasting, and less commonly pulmonary and cardiac toxicity.

=== Alpha-gal allergy ===
Certain geographic regions have a high rate of anaphylactic reactions to cetuximab upon the first exposure to the medication. This is unusual because exposure to the allergen must occur before the development of an allergy. Fewer than 1% of people in the northeast United States reacted, while greater than 20% in the southeast did.<ref>{{cite journal |pmc=3964477|year=2013|author1=Berg|first1=E. A.|title=Drug allergens and food—the cetuximab and galactose-α-1,3-galactose story|journal=Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology|volume=112|issue=2|pages=97–101|last2=Platts-Mills|first2=T. A.|last3=Commins|first3=S. P.|doi=10.1016/j.anai.2013.11.014|pmid=24468247}}</ref><ref name=Chi2008/> The [[alpha-gal allergy]] is believed to result from tick bites. [[Lone star tick]]s are native to the regions of the US where reactions occurred and were found to be the vector. Cetuximab is produced in the mouse myeloma cell line SP2/0 and thus contains the alpha-gal oligosaccharide, as do all mammals other than primates.

== Mechanism of action ==
Cetuximab is a chimeric (mouse/human) monoclonal antibody which binds to and inhibits EGFR.<ref name=Chi2008>{{cite journal|first1=Christine H.|last1=Chung|first2=Beloo|last2=Mirakhur|first3=Emily|last3=Chan|first4=Quynh-Thu|last4=Le|title=Cetuximab-Induced Anaphylaxis and IgE Specific for Galactose-α-1,3-Galactose|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=13 March 2008|issn=0028-4793|pages=1109–1117|volume=358|issue=11|pmid=18337601|pmc=2361129|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa074943|first5=Jordan|last5=Berlin|first6=Michael|last6=Morse|first7=Barbara A.|last7=Murphy|first8=Shama M.|last8=Satinover|first9=Jacob|last9=Hosen|first10=David|last10=Mauro|first11=Robbert J.|last11=Slebos|first12=Qinwei|last12=Zhou|first13=Diane|last13=Gold|first14=Tina|last14=Hatley|first15=Daniel J.|last15=Hicklin|first16=Thomas A.E.|last16=Platts-Mills}}</ref>

== KRAS Testing ==

The [[KRAS]] gene encodes a small G protein on the EGFR pathway. Cetuximab and other EGFR inhibitors only work on tumors in which KRAS is not mutated.<ref name="pmid19339720">{{cite journal | vauthors = Van Cutsem E, Köhne CH, Hitre E, Zaluski J, Chang Chien CR, Makhson A, D'Haens G, Pintér T, Lim R, Bodoky G, Roh JK, Folprecht G, Ruff P, Stroh C, Tejpar S, Schlichting M, Nippgen J, Rougier P | title = Cetuximab and chemotherapy as initial treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer | journal = N.

KRAS mutational analysis is commercially available from a number of laboratories.

In July 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updated the labels of two anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody drugs ([[panitumumab]] (Vectibix) and cetuximab (Erbitux)) indicated for treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer to include information about KRAS mutations.<ref name="urlCetuximab (Erbitux) and Panitumumab (Vectibix)"/>

Studies have indicated that detection of KRAS gene mutations helps physicians identify patients that are unlikely to respond to treatment with targeted EGFR inhibitors, including cetuximab and panitumumab. Accordingly, genetic testing to confirm the absence of KRAS mutations (and so the presence of the KRAS wild-type gene), is now clinically routine before the start of treatment with EGFR inhibitors. mCRC patients with wild-type KRAS tumors have been shown to benefit from a response rate of over 60% and a decreased risk for progression of over 40% when treated with Erbitux as 1st-line therapy.{{mcn|date=February 2016}}  Around 65% of mCRC patients have the KRAS wild-type gene.{{mcn|date=February 2016}}

=== Insider trading ===
{{Main|ImClone stock trading case}}
Cetuximab failed to get FDA approval in 2001, which caused the stock price of the developer [[ImClone]] to drop dramatically. Prior to the announcement, several executives sold stock, and the SEC launched an investigation into [[insider trading]]. This resulted in a widely publicized criminal case, which resulted in prison terms for media celebrity [[Martha Stewart]], ImClone chief executive officer [[Samuel D. Waksal]] and Stewart's broker at [[Merrill Lynch]], Peter Bacanovic.

==Research==
The efficacy of cetuximab was explored in a clinical trial of advanced [[gastric cancer]] published in 2013; cetuximab showed no survival benefit.<ref>Li K, Li J.
