'''Flavoxate''' is an [[anticholinergic]] with [[antimuscarinic]] effects. Its [[muscle relaxant]] properties may be due to a direct action on the smooth muscle rather than by antagonizing muscarinic receptors.

== Clinical uses ==
Flavoxate is used to treat urinary bladder spasms. It is available under the trade name Urispas (Paladin), Genurin (by Recordati, Italy) in Italy and KSA, Uritac by El Saad company in Syria,  under the name Bladderon by [[Nippon Shinyaku]] of Japan, or Bladuril in Chile, Utispas ( Apex Pharma) in Nepal.

Flavoxate is indicated for symptomatic relief of [[interstitial cystitis]], dysuria, urgency, nocturia, suprapubic pain, frequency and incontinence as may occur in cystitis, prostatitis, urethritis, urethrocystitis/urethrotrigonitis.

== Side effects ==
Flavoxate is generally well tolerated, but can potentially cause, vomiting, upset stomach, dry mouth or throat, blurred vision, eye pain,<ref>Zakir SM, Zaka-ur-Rab S, Salman MT, Khan RA. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2125.2008.03254.x/full Bilateral acute angle closure glaucoma in a 50-year-old female after oral administration of flavoxate]. British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology. 2008. 66(5):726-727</ref> and increased sensitivity of your eyes to light.

== Contraindications ==
Flavoxate is contraindicated in patients who have any of the following obstructive conditions: pyloric or duodenal obstruction, obstructive intestinal lesions or ileus, achalasia, gastrointestinal hemorrhage and obstructive uropathies of the lower urinary tract.
==Synthesis==

[[Nitration]] of [[hydroxypropiophenone]] ('''1''') followed by conversion of the phenol to its methyl by means of [[MeI]] provides the intermediate '''2'''; the nitro group is then reduced to the corresponding amine ('''3''') by catalytic reduction. The newly formed amine is then replaced by a nitrile group by successive conversion to the [[diazonium salt]] by means of [[nitrous acid]] followed by treatment with [[cuprous cyanide]] ('''4'''). Rxn with aluminium chloride|AlCl<sub>3</sub>]] cleaves the methyl ether to afford the ''ortho'' acylphenol ('''5'''). This is converted to the [[chromone]]/[[flavone]] ('''6''') in a [[Kostanecki acylation]] rxn with [[BzCl]] and [[sodium benzoate|NaOBz]]. The nitrile is next hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid ('''7''') by means of [[thionyl chloride|SOCl<sub>2</sub>]] and that treated with Î²-Piperidylethanol. There is thus obtained flavoxate ('''8'''), a muscle relaxant whose name reflects its flavone nucleus.
