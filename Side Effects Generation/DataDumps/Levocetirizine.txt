Chemically, levocetirizine is simply the isolated [[levorotary]] [[enantiomer]] of cetirizine, which is sold as a [[racemic]] mixture.

==Medical uses==
Levocetirizine is used for allergy symptoms including watery eyes, runny nose, sneezing, hives, and itching.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-148989/levocetirizine-oral/details | title = Levocetirizine Oral | publisher = [[WebMD]]}}</ref> The manufacturers claim it to be more effective with fewer [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] than previous second-generation drugs; however, there have been no published studies supporting this assertion. A study part-funded by the manufacturer [[UCB (company)|UCB]] concluded it may be more effective than some other second- and third-generation anti-histamines, but did not compare it to cetirizine.<ref name="pmid11868924">{{cite journal | vauthors = Grant JA, Riethuisen JM, Moulaert B, DeVos C | title = A double-blind, randomized, single-dose, crossover comparison of levocetirizine with ebastine, fexofenadine, loratadine, mizolastine, and placebo: suppression of histamine-induced wheal-and-flare response during 24 hours in healthy male subjects | journal = Ann.

==Side effects==
Levocetirizine is called a non-sedating antihistamine as it does not enter the brain in significant amounts, and is therefore unlikely to cause drowsiness. However, some people may experience some slight [[sleepiness]], [[headache]], [[Xerostomia|mouth dryness]], [[lightheadedness]], vision problems (mainly [[blurred vision]]), [[palpitations]] and [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]].<ref>XOZAL technical specifications booklet.</ref>

==Pharmacology==
Levocetirizine is an [[antihistamine]]. It acts as an [[inverse agonist]] that decreases activity at [[histamine H1 receptor]]s. This in turn prevents the release of other allergy chemicals and increase the blood supply to the area, and provides relief from the typical symptoms of hay fever. It does not prevent the actual release of histamine from [[mast cell]]s.

==Chemistry==
Chemically, levocetirizine is the active levorotary [[enantiomer]] of cetirizine, also called the ''l''-enantiomer of cetirizine. It is a member of the [[diphenylmethylpiperazine]] group of antihistamines.

==History==
Levocetirizine was first launched in 2001 by Belgian pharmaceutical company [[UCB (company)|UCB]].

===Availability===
On 31 January 2017, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved Xyzal as an over-the-counter drug.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDER/ucm106378.htm|accessdate=February 9, 2017|title=Prescription to Over-the-Counter (OTC) Switch List}}</ref> Although the drug was only authorized by the FDA on 25 May 2007, it was already available in most European countries. Like many new drugs it entered the market at a higher price than currently available third and second generation antihistamines. In India, one form of the drug is available as Crohist MK tablets and syrup, a formulation of levocetirizine hydrochloride and [[montelukast]]. In India, Crohist MK is a [[Schedule 'H']] drug and may only be prescribed by a registered medical practitioner. In Finland, Hungary, China, The United States and Kuwait<ref>On different names: http://www.hazipatika.com/gyogyszerkereso/termek/sefaller_5_mg_filmtabletta/54120</ref> the drug is sold over-the-counter.
