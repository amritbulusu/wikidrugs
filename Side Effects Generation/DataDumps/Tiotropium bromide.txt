'''Tiotropium bromide''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]])<ref>{{cite journal|journal=WHO Drug Information|date=1993|volume=7|issue=3|page=142|title=lnternational Nonproprietary Names for Pharmaceutical Substances |url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/druginformation/innlists/RL33.pdf?ua=1}}</ref> (originally marketed as '''Spiriva''')<ref>{{cite news|title=Tiotropium bromide|url=http://adis.springer.com/drugs/800001954|accessdate=8 March 2017|work=AdisInsight|language=en}}</ref> is a long-acting, 24-hour, [[anticholinergic]] [[bronchodilator]] used in the management of [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD). 

Tiotroprium was discovered in 1991 and came to market in 2004.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Corey|first1=E.J.|title=Molecules and Medicine|date=2012|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781118361733|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=jz2GN6DYoOoC&lpg=RA1-PT108&pg=RA1-PT39|chapter=Tiotropium bromide}}</ref>

== Medical uses ==

Tiotropium is used for maintenance treatment of [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema.<ref name=AHFS>{{cite web|title=Spiriva Handihaler|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/spiriva-handihaler.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref> It is not however used for [[Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|acute exacerbations]].<ref name=AHFS/>

== Adverse effects ==

Adverse effects are mainly related to its [[antimuscarinic]] effects. Common [[adverse drug reaction]]s (≥1% of patients) associated with tiotropium therapy include: dry mouth and/or throat irritation. Rarely (<0.1% of patients) treatment is associated with:[[urinary retention]], constipation, acute [[angle closure glaucoma]], palpitations (notably [[supraventricular tachycardia]] and [[atrial fibrillation]]) and/or allergy (rash, [[angioedema]], [[anaphylaxis]]).<ref>{{cite book |editor=Rossi S |title=[[Australian Medicines Handbook]] |location=Adelaide |year=2006 }}</ref>

Tiotropium and another member of its class [[ipratropium]] were linked to increased risk of heart attacks, stroke and cardiovascular death.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Singh S, Loke YK, Furberg CD |title=Inhaled anticholinergics and risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=JAMA |volume=300 |issue=12 |pages=1439–50 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18812535 |doi=10.1001/jama.300.12.1439 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18812535}}</ref> The FDA requested further trials; these are now complete, and adequately resolve the previous safety concerns.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/DrugSafetyInformationforHeathcareProfessionals/ucm197429.htm FDA.

Tiotropium mist inhaler ([[Respimat]]) has been found to be associated with an increase of all cause mortality in people with COPD.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Singh|first=S |author2=Loke, YK |author3=Enright, PL |author4=Furberg, CD|title=Mortality associated with tiotropium mist inhaler in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=Jun 14, 2011|volume=342|pages=d3215|pmid=21672999|doi=10.1136/bmj.d3215|pmc=3114950}}</ref>

== Dosage ==

The standard dose of tiotropium is 18 mcg which is administered by a HandiHaler inhalation device.<ref>Wise RA, Anzueto A, Cotton D, Dahl R, Devins T, Disse B, et al. Tiotropium respimat inhaler and the risk of death in COPD. N Engl J Med. 2013 08/30; 2013/10.</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==

Tiotropium is a [[muscarinic receptor]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]], often referred to as an antimuscarinic or [[anticholinergic]] agent. Although it does not display selectivity for specific muscarinic receptors, when topically applied it acts mainly on [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3|M<sub>3</sub>]] muscarinic receptors<ref name="pmid17127817">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kato M, Komamura K, Kitakaze M |title=Tiotropium, a novel muscarinic M3 receptor antagonist, improved symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease complicated by chronic heart failure |journal=Circ. J. |volume=70 |issue=12 |pages=1658–60 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17127817 |doi= 10.1253/circj.70.1658|url=http://joi.jlc.jst.go.jp/JST.JSTAGE/circj/70.1658?from=PubMed }}</ref> located on smooth muscle cells and submucosal glands. This leads to a reduction in [[smooth muscle]] contraction and mucus secretion and thus produces a [[bronchodilator]]y effect.

== Mode of delivery ==
The patient removes one tiotropium capsule from the blister pack, places it into the piercing chamber of the inhalation device and closes the mouthpiece.

The capsule is manually pierced, and the medication is inhaled through the mouthpiece. It is recommended that inhalations be repeated 2 to 3 times to ensure all medication is drawn from the capsule. When properly done, the capsule will make a distinctive flutter or rattle, audible to the patient.

Once the powder capsules are removed from the blister pack, it should be taken immediately via the inhalation device. If a capsule is exposed to the air, it will rapidly degrade to the point the dose will become ineffective. Any previously exposed capsules should be discarded.

The capsules cannot be taken orally - they will not be effective as respiratory medication if absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and may have side effects if absorbed via this route.
