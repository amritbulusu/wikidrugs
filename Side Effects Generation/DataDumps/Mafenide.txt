'''Mafenide''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]; usually as mafenide [[acetate]], trade name '''Sulfamylon''') is a [[sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]]-type medication used as an antibiotic. It was approved by the FDA in 1948.

==Uses==
Mafenide is used to treat severe [[Burn (injury)|burns]].<ref>{{cite journal | journal= J. Pharm.

It is [[bacteriostatic]] against many gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Some sources state that mafenide is more appropriate for non-facial burns, while [[chloramphenicol]]/[[prednisolone]] or [[bacitracin]] are more appropriate for facial burns.<ref name="pmid15967581">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Haik J, Ashkenazy O, Sinai S, etal |title=Burn care standards in Israel: lack of consensus |journal=Burns |volume=31 |issue=7 |pages=845–9 |date=November 2005 |pmid=15967581 |doi=10.1016/j.burns.2005.04.012 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0305-4179(05)00130-0}}</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==
Mafenide works by reducing the bacterial population present in the avascular tissues of burns and permits spontaneous healing of deep partial-thickness burns.

== Adverse reactions ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
Adverse reactions can include superinfection, pain or burning upon application, rash, pruritus, tachypnea, or hyperventilation. Mafenide is metabolized to a [[carbonic anhydrase inhibitor]], which could potentially result in metabolic acidosis.

== Drug interactions ==
There are no significant interactions.

== Contraindications ==
Mafenide is contraindicated in those with sulfonamide hypersensitivity or renal impairment.

== Dosage ==
For use as adjunctive therapy for second- and third-degree burns to prevent infection, adults and children should apply topically to a thickness of approximately 1.6&nbsp;mm to cleaned and debrided wound once or twice per day with a sterile gloved hand. The burned area should be covered with cream at all times.
