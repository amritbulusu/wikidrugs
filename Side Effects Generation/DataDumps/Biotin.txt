'''Biotin''' is a water-soluble [[B vitamins|B-vitamin]], also called '''vitamin B<sub>7</sub>''' and formerly known as '''vitamin H''' or '''coenzyme R'''.<ref name=mlp/>

It is composed of a ureido ring fused with a [[tetrahydrothiophene]] ring. A [[valeric acid]] substituent is attached to one of the carbon atoms of the tetrahydrothiophene ring.  Biotin is a [[coenzyme]] for [[carboxylase]] enzymes, involved in the synthesis of [[fatty acid]]s, [[isoleucine]], and [[valine]], and in [[gluconeogenesis]].

[[Biotin deficiency]] can be caused by inadequate dietary intake or inheritance of one or more inborn genetic disorders that affect biotin metabolism. Subclinical deficiency can cause mild symptoms, such as hair thinning or skin rash typically on the face. Neonatal screening for biotinidase deficiency began in the United States in 1984 and today many countries test for this disorder at birth. Individuals born prior to 1984 are unlikely to have been screened, thus the true prevalence of the disorder is unknown.

==General==

[[File:M. Dean Burk.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Dean Burk]], American biochemist who co-discovered biotin.]]
Biotin is necessary for cell growth, the production of fatty acids, and the metabolism of fats and [[amino acids]].<ref name=mlp/> Biotin assists in various metabolic reactions involving the transfer of [[carbon dioxide]]. It may also be helpful in maintaining a steady [[blood sugar]] level. Biotin is often recommended as a [[dietary supplement]] for strengthening hair and nails, though scientific data supporting this outcome are weak.<ref name=mlp/>  Nevertheless, biotin is found in many cosmetics and health products for the hair and skin.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=11800048 | volume=20 Suppl 4 | title=Final report on the safety assessment of biotin. | year=2001 | journal=Int J Toxicol | pages=1–12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/vitamin-h-000342.htm|title=Vitamin H (Biotin)|date=1 June 2011|publisher=[[University of Maryland Medical Center]]|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref>

Biotin deficiency is rare. The amounts needed are small, a wide range of foods contain biotin, and intestinal bacteria synthesize biotin, which is then absorbed by the host animal. For that reason, statutory agencies in many countries, for example the USA<ref name="The National Academies Press">{{Cite book|editor1=Otten, JJ |editor2=Hellwig, JP |editor3=Meyers, LD. | title=Dietary Reference Intakes: The Essential Guide to Nutrient Requirements| publisher= The National Academies Press| year=  2006 | isbn = 0-309-10091-7}}</ref> and Australia,<ref>[http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/file/publications/synopses/n35.pdf National Health and Medical Research Council: Nutrient Reference Values for Australia and New Zealand]</ref> have not formally established a recommended daily intake of biotin. Instead, an Adequate Intake (AI) is identified based on the theory that average intake meets needs. Future research could result in biotin AIs with EARs and RDAs (see Dietary Reference Intake section).

A number of rare [[Biotin#Metabolic disorders|metabolic disorders]] exist in which an individual's metabolism of biotin is abnormal, such as deficiency in the holocarboxylase synthetase enzyme which covalently links biotin onto the carboxylase, where the biotin acts as a cofactor.<ref name="pmid19727438">{{cite journal |vauthors=Zempleni J, Hassan YI, Wijeratne SS | title = Biotin and biotinidase deficiency | journal = Expert Rev Endocrinol Metab | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages = 715–724 | year = 2008 | pmid = 19727438 | pmc = 2726758 | doi = 10.1586/17446651.3.6.715 }}</ref>

==Biosynthesis==
Biotin has an unusual structure (see above figure), with two rings fused together via one of their sides. The two rings are ureido and [[thiophene]] moieties.  Biotin is a heterocyclic, S-containing mono[[carboxylic acid]]. It is made from two precursors, [[alanine]] and [[Pimelic acid|pimeloyl]]-CoA via three enzymes.  8-Amino-7-oxopelargonic acid synthase is a [[pyridoxal 5'-phosphate]] enzyme. The pimeloyl-CoA, could be produced by a modified fatty acid pathway involving a malonyl thioester as the starter. 7,8Diaminopelargonic acid (DAPA) aminotransferase is unusual in using [[S-adenosyl methionine]] (SAM) as the NH<sub>2</sub> donor. Dethiobiotin synthetase catalyzes the formation of the ureido ring via a DAPA carbamate activated with ATP. Biotin synthase reductively cleaves SAM into a deoxyadenosyl radical—a first radical formed on dethiobiotin is trapped by the sulfur donor, which was found to be the iron-sulfur (Fe-S) center contained in the enzyme.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Marquet A, Bui BT, Florentin D | title = Biosynthesis of biotin and lipoic acid | journal = Vitam.

==Cofactor biochemistry==
<small>D</small>-(+)-Biotin is a [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] responsible for [[carbon dioxide]] transfer in several [[carboxylase]] [[enzyme]]s:

* [[Acetyl-CoA carboxylase|Acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha]]
* [[Acetyl-CoA carboxylase|Acetyl-CoA carboxylase beta]]
* [[Methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase]]
* [[Propionyl-CoA carboxylase]]
* [[Pyruvate carboxylase]]

Biotin is important in [[fatty acid synthesis]], branched-chain [[amino acid catabolism]], and [[gluconeogenesis]].<ref name=mlp/> It covalently attaches to the epsilon-amino group of specific [[lysine]] residues in these carboxylases. This [[biotinylation]] reaction requires [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and is catalyzed by [[holocarboxylase synthetase]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Zempleni J, Wijeratne SS, Hassan YI | title = Biotin | journal = BioFactors | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 36–46 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19319844 | doi = 10.1002/biof.8 }}</ref> In bacteria, biotin is attached to [[biotin carboxyl carrier protein]] (BCCP) by biotin protein ligase (BirA in ''E. coli'').<ref name="pmid10064313">{{cite journal |vauthors=Chapman-Smith A, Cronan JE | title = Molecular biology of biotin attachment to proteins | journal = J.

Biotin binds tightly to the tetrameric protein [[avidin]] (also [[streptavidin]] and [[neutravidin]]), with a [[dissociation constant]] ''K''<sub>d</sub> on the order of 10<sup>−15</sup> M, which is one of the strongest known protein-ligand interactions.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Laitinen OH, Hytönen VP, Nordlund HR, Kulomaa MS | title = Genetically engineered avidins and streptavidins | journal = Cell Mol Life Sci. | volume = 63 | issue = 24 | pages = 2992–3017 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17086379 | doi = 10.1007/s00018-006-6288-z }}</ref> This is often used in different biotechnological applications.

==Dietary recommendations==
The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for biotin in 1998. At that time there was not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs for biotin. In instances such as this, the Board sets Adequate Intakes (AIs), with the understanding that at some later date, AIs will be replaced by more exact information. The current AI for adults ages 19 and up is 30 μg/day. AI for pregnancy is 30 μg/day. AI for lactation is 35 μg/day. For infants up to 12 months the AI is 5-6 μg/day For children ages 1–18 years the AI increases with age from 8 to 25 μg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (known as ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of biotin there is no UL, as there is no human data for adverse effects from high doses. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s (DRIs).<ref name="DRItext">{{cite book | last1 = [[Institute of Medicine]] | title = Dietary Reference Intakes for Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin, and Choline | chapter = Biotin | publisher = The National Academies Press | year = 1998 | location = Washington, DC | pages = 374–389 | url = http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6015&page=374 | accessdate = 2017-08-29 | isbn = 0-309-06554-2}}</ref>  

The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined the same as in United States. For women and men over age 18 the Adequate Intake (AI) is set at 40 μg/day. AI for pregnancy is 40 μg/day, for lactation 45 μg/day. For children ages 1–17 years the AIs increase with age from 20 to 35 μg/day. These AIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs.<ref>{{cite web | title = Overview on Dietary Reference Values for the EU population as derived by the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies| year = 2017| url = https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf}}</ref> The EFSA also reviewed the safety question and reached the same conclusion as in United States - that there was not sufficient evidence to set a UL for biotin.<ref>{{cite web | title = Tolerable Upper Intake Levels For Vitamins And Minerals| publisher = European Food Safety Authority| year = 2006| url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf}}</ref>

For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For biotin labeling purposes 100% of the Daily Value was 300 μg, but as of May 27, 2016 it was revised to 30 μg to bring it into agreement with the AI.<ref name="FedReg">{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-27/pdf/2016-11867.pdf |title=Federal Register May 27, 2016 Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels}}</ref> A table of the old and new adult Daily Values is provided at [[Reference Daily Intake]]. The original deadline to be in compliance was July 28, 2018, but on September 29, 2017 the FDA released a proposed rule that extended the deadline to January 1, 2020 for large companies and January 1, 2021 for small companies.<ref name="FDAdelay"> [https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm385663.htm#dates "Changes to the Nutrition Facts Panel - Compliance Date"]</ref>

Biotin is also available in [[dietary supplement]]s, as an ingredient in multi-vit/min products or as a biotin-containing supplement with health benefit claims.

== Import into the cell ==
In [[mammal]]s biotin is imported into cells by the Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent multivitamin ([[Pantothenic acid|pantothenate]], biotin, [[Lipoic acid|lipoate]]) transporter ([[SMVT]]).<ref>[http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.21.5.2 Na+-dependent multivitamin (pantothenate, biotin, lipoate) transporter] in the [http://www.tcdb.org/ Transporter Classification Database], accessed 7 Jan 2016</ref>

In [[bacteria]], several families of proteins, especially the BioY family of transporters, imports biotin into cells.<ref>[http://www.tcdb.org/search/index.php?query=biotin%20transporter&type=system biotin transporters] in the [http://www.tcdb.org/ Transporter Classification Database], accessed 7 Jan 2016</ref>

==Bioavailability==
Biotin is also called vitamin H (the H represents ''Haar und Haut'', German words for "hair and skin") or vitamin B<sub>7</sub>. Studies on its [[bioavailability]] have been conducted in rats and in chicks. Based on these studies, biotin bioavailability may be low or variable, depending on the type of food being consumed. In general, biotin exists in food as protein-bound form or [[biocytin]].<ref name=Gropper>{{Cite book| vauthors= Gropper SS, Smith JL, Groff JL | title= Advanced nutrition and human metabolism| year=2005| publisher= Belmont| isbn= 0-534-55986-7}}</ref> Proteolysis by protease is required prior to absorption. This process assists free biotin release from biocytin and protein-bound biotin. The biotin present in corn is readily available; however, most grains have about a 20-40% bioavailability of biotin.<ref name=Combs>{{Cite book| author = Combs, Gerald F. Jr. | title= The Vitamins: Fundamental Aspects in Nutrition and Health | year= 2008| publisher= San Diego: Elsevier, Inc| isbn = 978-0-12-183493-7}}</ref>

The wide variability in biotin bioavailability may be due to the ability of an organism to break various biotin-protein bonds from food. Whether an organism has an enzyme with that ability will determine the bioavailability of biotin from the foodstuff.<ref name="Combs" />

===Factors that affect biotin requirements===
The frequency of marginal biotin status is not known, but the incidence of low circulating biotin levels in alcoholics has been found to be much greater than in the general population.  Also, relatively low levels of biotin have been reported in the urine or plasma of patients who have had a partial [[gastrectomy]] or have other causes of [[achlorhydria]], burn patients, [[epileptics]], elderly individuals, and athletes.<ref name="Combs" /> Pregnancy and [[lactation]] may be associated with an increased demand for biotin.  In pregnancy, this may be due to a possible acceleration of biotin [[catabolism]], whereas, in lactation, the higher demand has yet to be elucidated.  Recent studies have shown marginal biotin deficiency can be present in [[human gestation]], as evidenced by increased urinary excretion of [[beta-Hydroxy beta-methylbutyric acid|3-hydroxyisovaleric acid]], decreased urinary excretion of biotin and [[bisnorbiotin]], and decreased plasma concentration of biotin.  Additionally, smoking may further accelerate biotin catabolism in women.<ref>{{Cite book|editor1=Bowman, BA |editor2=Russell, RM. | title=Present Knowledge in Nutrition, Ninth Edition, Vol 1| publisher= Washington, DC: International Life Sciences Institute| year=  2006 | contribution=Biotin | isbn = 978-1-57881-198-4 }}</ref>

==Deficiency==

[[Biotin deficiency]] typically occurs from dietary absence of the vitamin. Daily consumption of white raw eggs for several months may result in biotin deficiency.<ref name=mlp>{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/313.html |title=Biotin: MedlinePlus Supplements |date=13 September 2013 |accessdate=2013-09-29}}</ref>

Deficiency can be addressed with nutritional supplementation.<ref name=mlp/>

Deficiency symptoms include:
* Brittle and thin fingernails
* Hair loss ([[alopecia]])
* [[Conjunctivitis]]
* [[Dermatitis]] in the form of a scaly, red rash around the eyes, nose, mouth, and genital area.
* Neurological symptoms in adults, such as depression, lethargy, hallucination, and numbness and tingling of the extremities<ref name=mlp/>

The neurological and psychological symptoms can occur with only mild deficiencies. Dermatitis, conjunctivitis, and hair loss will generally occur only when deficiency becomes more severe.<ref name=mlp/>

Individuals with hereditary disorders of biotin deficiency have evidence of impaired immune system function, including increased susceptibility to bacterial and fungal infections.<ref name="Higdon">{{cite web | url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/vitamins/biotin | title=Biotin | publisher=Linus Pauling Institute, Micronutrient Information Center, Oregon State University, Corvallis | date=2016 | accessdate=12 October 2016 | author=Higdon, Jane}}</ref>

Pregnant women tend to have a higher risk of biotin deficiency. Nearly half of pregnant women have abnormal increases of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid, which reflects reduced status of biotin.<ref name=Higdon /><!--pg.2-->

==Metabolic disorders==
Inherited metabolic disorders characterized by deficient activities of biotin-dependent carboxylases are termed [[multiple carboxylase deficiency]]. These include deficiencies in the enzymes [[holocarboxylase synthetase]] or [[biotinidase]]. [[Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency]] prevents the body's cells from using biotin effectively, and thus interferes with multiple carboxylase reactions.<ref name="Wolf B, Grier RE, Secor McVoy JR, Heard GS. 1985 53–8">{{cite journal |vauthors=Wolf B, Grier RE, Secor McVoy JR, Heard GS | title = Biotinidase deficiency: a novel vitamin recycling defect | journal = J Inherit Metab Dis. | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 53–8 | year = 1985 | pmid = 3930841 | doi = 10.1007/BF01800660 }}</ref> Biochemical and clinical manifestations include: keto[[lactic acidosis]], [[organic aciduria]], [[hyperammonemia]], skin rash, feeding problems, [[hypotonia]], [[seizure]]s, [[developmental delay]], [[alopecia]], and [[coma]].

[[Biotinidase deficiency]] is not due to inadequate biotin, but rather to a deficiency in the [[enzymes]] that process it. [[Biotinidase]] catalyzes the cleavage of biotin from biocytin and biotinyl-peptides (the proteolytic degradation products of each [[holocarboxylase]]) and thereby recycles biotin. It is also important in freeing biotin from dietary protein-bound biotin.<ref name="Wolf B, Grier RE, Secor McVoy JR, Heard GS. 1985 53–8"/> General symptoms include decreased [[appetite]] and [[Human development (biology)|growth]]. Dermatologic symptoms include [[dermatitis]], alopecia, and [[achromotrichia]] (absence or loss of pigment in the hair). [[Perosis]] (a shortening and thickening of bones) is seen in the skeleton.  Fatty liver and kidney syndrome and [[hepatic steatosis]] also can occur.<ref name="Combs" />

==Use in biotechnology==
Biotin is widely used throughout the [[biotechnology]] industry to [[Conjugated protein|conjugate]] proteins for biochemical assays.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.piercenet.com/browse.cfm?fldID=4DDCADD2-5056-8A76-4E7E-2E00843BE346|title=Overview of Protein Labeling|publisher=[[Thermo Fisher Scientific]]|accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref> Biotin's small size means the biological activity of the protein will most likely be unaffected. This process is called [[biotinylation]]. Because both [[streptavidin]] and [[avidin]] bind biotin with high affinity (K<sub>d</sub> of  10<sup>−14</sup>&nbsp;mol/l to 10<sup>−15</sup>&nbsp;mol/l) and specificity, biotinylated proteins of interest can be isolated from a sample by exploiting this highly stable interaction.  The sample is incubated with streptavidin/avidin beads, allowing capture of the biotinylated protein of interest.  Any other proteins binding to the biotinylated molecule will also stay with the bead and all other unbound proteins can be washed away.  However, due to the extremely strong streptavidin-biotin interaction, very harsh conditions are needed to elute the biotinylated protein from the beads (typically 6M [[guanidine]] HCl at pH&nbsp;1.5), which often will denature the protein of interest.  To circumvent this problem, beads conjugated to monomeric avidin can be used, which has a decreased biotin-binding affinity of ~10<sup>−8</sup>&nbsp;mol/l, allowing the biotinylated protein of interest to be eluted with excess free biotin.

As one of the strongest non-covalent interactions, the binding of biotin to streptavidin is commonly used as the target molecular interaction in the research of biosensors and cell sorting.<ref name="JOSAA2013">{{cite journal|last1=Xu|first1=Zhida|last2=Xinhao|first2=Wang|last3=Han|first3=Kevin|last4=Li|first4=Shuo|last5=Liu|first5=Logan |title= Elastomeric 2D grating and hemispherical optofluidic chamber for multifunctional fluidic sensing |journal= Journal of the Optical Society of America A|date=2013 |volume=30 |issue=12 |at=pp. 2466–2472 |doi= 10.1364/JOSAA.30.002466 |url= https://www.osapublishing.org/josaa/abstract.cfm?uri=josaa-30-12-2466}}</ref><ref name="Nanoscale2016">{{cite journal |last1=Xu |first1=Zhida |last2=Jiang |first2=Jing |last3=Wang |first3=Xinhao |last4=Han |first4=Kevin |last5=Ameen |first5=Abid |last6=Khan |first6=Ibrahim |last7=Chang |first7=Te-Wei |last8=Liu |first8=Logan |title= Large-area, uniform and low-cost dual-mode plasmonic naked-eye colorimetry and SERS sensor with handheld Raman spectrometer |journal= Nanoscale |date=2016 |volume=8 |issue=11 |pages= 6162–6172 |doi= 10.1039/C5NR08357E |url= http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/nr/c5nr08357e#!divAbstract}}</ref>

[[ELISA]]s often make use of biotinylated detection antibodies against the antigen of interest, followed by a detection step using streptavidin conjugated to a reporter molecule, such as [[horseradish peroxidase]] or [[alkaline phosphatase]].

==Toxicity==
Animal studies have indicated few, if any, effects due to high level doses of biotin.  This may provide evidence that both animals and humans could tolerate doses of at least an order of magnitude greater than each of their nutritional requirements.  There are no reported cases of adverse effects from receiving high doses of the vitamin, in particular, when used in the treatment of metabolic disorders causing seborrheic [[dermatitis]] in infants.<ref name=Combs2>{{Cite book| author = Combs, Gerald F.
