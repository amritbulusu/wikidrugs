'''Bumetanide''' (trade names '''Bumex''' or '''Burinex''') is a [[loop diuretic]] of the sulfamyl category, most often used to treat [[heart failure]]. It is often used in people in whom high doses of [[furosemide]] or other diuretics are ineffective. It is marketed by [[Hoffmann-La Roche]]. The main difference between bumetanide and furosemide is in their [[bioavailability]] and potency. About 60% of furosemide is absorbed in the intestine, and there are substantial inter- and intraindividual differences in bioavailability (range 10-90%). About 80% of bumetanide is absorbed, and its absorption does not change when it is taken with food. It is said to be a more predictable diuretic, meaning that the predictable absorption is reflected in a more predictable effect.<ref name="Brunton, Laurence 2006">{{cite book |editor1-last=Brunton |editor1-first=Laurence |editor2-last=Lazo |editor2-first=John S. |editor3-last=Parker |editor3-first=Keith L. |year=2006 |title=Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=0-07-142280-3 |edition=11th |pages=749–753 }}</ref>

Bumetanide is 40 times more potent than furosemide for patients with normal [[renal function]].<ref name="Brunton, Laurence 2006" />

In the brain, bumetanide blocks the [[NKCC1]] cation-chloride co-transporter, and thus decreases internal chloride concentration in [[neurons]]. In turn, this concentration change makes the action of [[GABA]] more hyperpolarizing, which may be useful for treatment of [[neonatal]] [[seizure]]s, which quite often are not responsive to traditional GABA-targeted treatment, such as [[barbiturates]]. Bumetanide is therefore currently{{when|date=June 2017}} under evaluation as a prospective antiepileptic drug.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Löscher W, Puskarjov M, Kaila K |title=Cation-chloride cotransporters NKCC1 and KCC2 as potential targets for novel antiepileptic and antiepileptogenic treatments |journal=Neuropharmacology |volume=69 |issue= |pages=62–74 |date=June 2013  |pmid=22705273 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropharm.2012.05.045 |url=}}</ref>

==Abuse==
On October 24, 2008, ESPN reported that four [[NFL]] players were being suspended under the steroid policy as a result of taking bumetanide.<ref>{{cite web|title=McAllister, Smith, Grant, Texans' Pittman among players testing positive|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=3661845|website=ESPN.com|publisher=ESPN|access-date=June 6, 2017|date=October 26, 2008}}</ref> It is sometimes used for weight loss because, as a diuretic, it removes water, but it also masks other drugs, including steroids, by diluting the contents of the user's urine, yielding a lower concentration of filtered substances, which makes them less likely to be detected.

Bumetanide was an undisclosed [[active ingredient]] in the [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] [[weight loss]] supplement [[StarCaps]], which was removed from the market after its presence was discovered by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations – U.S. Department of Justice Press Release – Pills Sold Throughout the United States Contained an Undisclosed Prescription Drug Banned By the National Football League|url=https://www.fda.gov/iceci/criminalinvestigations/ucm391757.htm|website=fda.gov|publisher=United States Food and Drug Administration|access-date=June 6, 2017|date=March 26, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=George Gurley |title=Nikki Haskell Learns the Social Cost of Supporting Donald Trump |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/style/nikki-haskell-donald-trump-supporter-socialite.html?action=click&contentCollection=The%20Upshot&module=Trending&version=Full&region=Marginalia&pgtype=article |quote= |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=February 23, 2017 }}</ref>

==Synthesis==
Bumetanide, 3-butylamino-4-phenoxy-5-sulfamoylbenzoic acid, is synthesized from 4-chlorobenzoic acid. In the first stage of synthesis, it undergoes sulfonylchlorination by chlorosulfonic acid, forming 4-chloro-3-chlorosulfonylbenzoic acid, which is further nitrated with nitric acid to 4-chloro-3-chlorosulfonyl-5-nitrobenzoic acid. Reacting this with ammonia gives 5-aminosulfonyl-4-chloro-3-nitrobenzoic acid, which when reacted with sodium phenolate is transformed into 5-amino-sulfonyl-3-nitro-5-phenoxybenzoid acid. Reduction of the nitro group in this product by hydrogen using a palladium on carbon catalyst gives 3-amino-5-aminosulfonyl- 5-phenoxybenzoic acid. Finally, reacting this with butyl alcohol in the presence of sulfuric acid gives the desired bumetanide.{{cn|date=June 2017}}
