'''Growth hormone''' ('''GH'''), also known as '''somatotropin''' (or as '''human growth hormone''' [hGH or HGH] in its human form), is a [[peptide hormone]] that stimulates growth, [[cell (biology)|cell]] reproduction, and cell regeneration in humans and other animals. It is thus important in [[human development (biology)|human development]]. It is a type of [[mitogen]] which is specific only to certain kinds of cells. Growth hormone is a 191-[[amino acid]], single-chain [[polypeptide]] that is synthesized, stored, and secreted by [[somatotropic cell]]s within the lateral wings of the [[anterior pituitary]] gland.

GH is a [[stress hormone]] that raises the concentration of glucose and free fatty acids.<ref name="pmid21584161">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ranabir S, Reetu K | title = Stress and hormones | journal = Indian J Endocrinol Metab | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 18–22 |date=January 2011 | pmid = 21584161 | pmc = 3079864 | doi = 10.4103/2230-8210.77573 }}</ref><ref name="pmid5960526">{{cite journal |vauthors=Greenwood FC, Landon J | title = Growth hormone secretion in response to stress in man | journal = Nature | volume = 210 | issue = 5035 | pages = 540–1 |date=April 1966 | pmid = 5960526 | doi = 10.1038/210540a0 }}</ref> It also stimulates production of [[IGF-1]].

A [[recombinant DNA|recombinant]] form of hGH called '''somatropin''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) is used as a [[prescription drug]] to treat children's growth disorders and adult [[growth hormone deficiency]]. In the United States, it is only available legally from pharmacies, by prescription from a doctor. In recent years in the United States, some doctors have started to prescribe growth hormone in GH-deficient older patients (but not on healthy people) to increase vitality.   While legal, the efficacy and safety of this use for HGH has not been tested in a clinical trial.   At this time, HGH is still considered a very complex hormone, and many of its functions are still unknown.<ref name="ped">{{cite book | author = Powers M |veditors=Leaver-Dunn D, Houglum J, Harrelson GL | title = Principles of Pharmacology for Athletic Trainers | edition = | language = | publisher = Slack Incorporated | location = | year = 2005 | origyear = | pages = 331–332 | chapter = Performance-Enhancing Drugs| quote = | isbn = 1-55642-594-5 }}</ref>

In its role as an [[anabolic]] agent, HGH has been used by competitors in sports since at least 1982,  and has been banned by the [[IOC]] and [[NCAA]].  Traditional [[urine]] analysis does not detect [[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|doping]] with HGH, so the ban was unenforceable until the early 2000s, when [[blood test]]s that could distinguish between natural and artificial HGH were starting to be developed. Blood tests conducted by [[World Anti-Doping Agency|WADA]] at the [[2004 Olympic Games]] in [[Athens, Greece]] targeted primarily HGH.<ref name=ped/>  Use of the drug for performance enhancement is not currently approved by the [[FDA]].

GH has been studied for use in raising livestock more efficiently in [[industrial agriculture]] and several efforts have been made to obtain governmental approval to use GH in livestock production.  These uses have been controversial.  In the United States, the only FDA-approved use of GH for livestock is the use of a cow-specific form of GH called [[bovine somatotropin]] for increasing milk production in dairy cows. Retailers are permitted to label containers of milk as produced with or without bovine somatotropin.

==Nomenclature==

The names ''somatotropin'' (''STH'') or ''somatotropic hormone'' refer to the [[growth hormone 1|growth hormone]] produced naturally in animals and extracted from carcasses. Hormone extracted from human cadavers is abbreviated hGH. The main growth hormone produced by [[recombinant DNA]] technology has the approved generic name somatropin ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) and the brand name Humatrope,<ref>{{cite journal | author=Daniels ME | title= Lilly's Humatrope Experience | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 10 | pages = 812 | year = 1992 | doi = 10.1038/nbt0792-812a | issue=7}}</ref> and is properly abbreviated rhGH in the scientific literature. Since its introduction in 1992 Humatrope has been a banned sports doping agent,<ref name="pmid16799101">{{cite journal |vauthors=Saugy M, Robinson N, Saudan C, Baume N, Avois L, Mangin P | title = Human growth hormone doping in sport | journal = Br J Sports Med | volume = 40 Suppl 1 | issue = | pages = i35–9 |date=July 2006 | pmid = 16799101 | pmc = 2657499 | doi = 10.1136/bjsm.2006.027573 }}</ref> and in this context is referred to as HGH.

===Gene===
{{Main|Growth hormone 1|Growth hormone 2}}
Genes for human growth hormone, known as [[growth hormone 1]] (somatotropin; pituitary growth hormone) and [[growth hormone 2]] (placental growth hormone; growth hormone variant), are localized in the q22-24 region of chromosome 17<ref name="urlGH1 growth hormone 1 (Homo sapiens) - Gene - NCBI">{{cite web | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2688 | title = GH1 growth hormone 1 (Homo sapiens) - Gene  | publisher = National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine }}</ref><ref name="urlGH2 growth hormone 2 (Homo sapiens) - Gene - NCBI">{{cite web | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2689 | title = GH2 growth hormone 2 (Homo sapiens) - Gene | publisher = National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine }}</ref> and are closely related to [[somatomammotropin|human chorionic somatomammotropin]] (also known as [[placental lactogen]]) genes. GH, human chorionic somatomammotropin, and [[prolactin]] belong to [[Somatotropin family|a group of homologous hormones]] with growth-promoting and lactogenic activity.

===Structure===

The major isoform of the human growth hormone is a protein of 191 [[amino acid]]s and a molecular weight of 22,124 [[Atomic mass unit|daltons]]. The structure includes four helices necessary for functional interaction with the GH receptor. It appears that, in structure, GH is evolutionarily homologous to prolactin and chorionic somatomammotropin. Despite marked structural similarities between growth hormone from different [[species]], only human and [[Old World monkey]] growth hormones have significant effects on the human [[growth hormone receptor]].<ref name="pmid12082127">{{cite journal |vauthors=Yi S, Bernat B, Pál G, Kossiakoff A, Li WH | title = Functional promiscuity of squirrel monkey growth hormone receptor toward both primate and nonprimate growth hormones | journal = Mol.

Several [[molecule|molecular]] isoforms of GH exist in the pituitary gland and are released to blood. In particular, a variant of approximately 20 kDa originated by an alternative splicing is present in a rather constant 1:9 ratio,<ref name="pmid12217902">{{cite journal |vauthors=Leung KC, Howe C, Gui LY, Trout G, Veldhuis JD, Ho KK | title = Physiological and pharmacological regulation of 20-kDa growth hormone | journal = Am.

===Regulation===
{{See also|Hypothalamic–pituitary–somatic axis}}

Secretion of growth hormone (GH) in the pituitary is regulated by the [[Neurosecretion|neurosecretory]] nuclei of the [[hypothalamus]]. 
These cells release the peptides [[Growth hormone-releasing hormone]] (GHRH or ''somatocrinin'') and [[Somatostatin|Growth hormone-inhibiting hormone]] (GHIH or ''somatostatin'') into the [[hypophyseal portal system|hypophyseal portal]] venous blood surrounding the pituitary.
GH release in the pituitary is primarily determined by the balance of these two peptides, which in turn is affected by many physiological stimulators (e.g., exercise, nutrition, sleep) and inhibitors (e.g., free fatty acids) of GH secretion.<ref name="isbn0-321-53910-9">{{cite book |vauthors=Bartholomew EF, Martini F, Nath JL | title = Fundamentals of anatomy & physiology | edition = | language = | publisher = Pearson Education Inc | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ | year = 2009 | origyear = | pages = 616–617 | quote = | isbn = 0-321-53910-9 }}</ref>

[[Somatotropic cell]]s in the [[anterior pituitary]] gland then synthesize and secrete GH in a pulsatile manner, in response to these stimuli by the hypothalamus. 
The largest and most predictable of these GH peaks occurs about an hour after onset of sleep with plasma levels of 13 to 72&nbsp;ng/mL.<ref name="Takahashi">{{cite journal |vauthors=Takahashi Y, Kipnis D, Daughaday W |title=Growth hormone secretion during sleep | journal = J Clin Invest | volume = 47 | issue = 9 | pages = 2079–90 | year = 1968 | pmid = 5675428 | doi = 10.1172/JCI105893 | pmc = 297368}}</ref> 
Otherwise there is wide variation between days and individuals. Nearly fifty percent of GH secretion occurs during the third and fourth [[NREM sleep]] stages.<ref name="pmid11817985">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mehta A, Hindmarsh PC | title = The use of somatropin (recombinant growth hormone) in children of short stature | journal = Paediatr Drugs | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–47 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11817985 | doi =  10.2165/00128072-200204010-00005}}</ref>

===Function===
[[File:Endocrine growth regulation.svg|thumb|240px|Main pathways in endocrine regulation of growth.]]

Effects of growth hormone on the tissues of the body can generally be described as [[anabolism|anabolic]] (building up).  Like most other protein hormones, GH acts by interacting with a specific [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] on the surface of cells.

Increased height during childhood is the most widely known effect of GH.  Height appears to be stimulated by at least two mechanisms:

# Because [[polypeptide]] hormones are not fat-[[soluble]], they cannot penetrate [[cell membranes]]. Thus, GH exerts some of its effects by binding to receptors on target cells, where it activates the [[MAPK/ERK pathway]].<ref name="Binder_2007">{{cite journal |vauthors=Binder G, Wittekindt N, Ranke MB | title = Noonan Syndrome: Genetics and Responsiveness to Growth Hormone Therapy | journal = Horm Res |date=February 2007 | volume = 67 | isbn = 978-3-8055-8255-1 | issue = Supplement 1 | pages = 45–49 | doi=10.1159/000097552 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=nQ9ilbixQEgC&pg=PA46&lpg=PA46&dq=gh+growth+hormone+ras&q=gh%20growth%20hormone%20ras}}</ref> Through this mechanism GH directly stimulates division and multiplication of [[chondrocyte]]s of [[cartilage]].

IGF-1 has growth-stimulating effects on a wide variety of tissues. Additional IGF-1 is generated within target tissues, making it what appears to be both an [[endocrine gland|endocrine]] and an [[autocrine]]/[[paracrine]] hormone. IGF-1 also has stimulatory effects on [[osteoblast]] and [[chondrocyte]] activity to promote bone growth.

In addition to increasing height in children and adolescents, growth hormone has many other effects on the body:
* Increases [[calcium]] retention{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}, and strengthens and increases the [[mineralization of bone]]
* Increases [[muscle]] mass through [[sarcomere]] [[hypertrophy]]
* Promotes [[lipolysis]]
* Increases [[protein synthesis]]

==Clinical significance==

===Excess===

The most common disease of GH excess is a pituitary tumor composed of somatotroph cells of the anterior pituitary. These somatotroph [[adenoma]]s are benign and grow slowly, gradually producing more and more GH. For years, the principal clinical problems are those of GH excess. Eventually, the adenoma may become large enough to cause headaches, impair vision by pressure on the optic nerves, or cause deficiency of other pituitary hormones by displacement.

Prolonged GH excess thickens the bones of the jaw, fingers and toes. Resulting heaviness of the jaw and increased size of digits is referred to as [[acromegaly]]. Accompanying problems can include sweating, pressure on nerves (e.g., [[carpal tunnel syndrome]]), muscle weakness, excess [[sex hormone-binding globulin]] (SHBG), insulin resistance or even a rare form of [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]], and reduced sexual function.

GH-secreting tumors are typically recognized in the fifth decade of life. It is extremely rare for such a tumor to occur in childhood, but, when it does, the excessive GH can cause excessive growth, traditionally referred to as [[gigantism|pituitary gigantism]].

Surgical removal is the usual treatment for GH-producing tumors. In some circumstances, focused radiation or a GH antagonist such as [[pegvisomant]] may be employed to shrink the tumor or block function. Other drugs like [[octreotide]] (somatostatin agonist) and [[bromocriptine]] ([[dopamine agonist]]) can be used to block GH secretion because both somatostatin and [[dopamine]] negatively inhibit GHRH-mediated GH release from the anterior pituitary.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Deficiency===
{{Main|Growth hormone deficiency}}
The effects of [[growth hormone deficiency]] vary depending on the age at which they occur. In children, [[growth failure]] and [[short stature]] are the major manifestations of GH deficiency, with common causes including genetic conditions and congenital malformations. It can also cause delayed sexual maturity. In adults, deficiency is rare,<ref name="Molitch et al. 2006">{{cite journal | author = Molitch ME, Clemmons DR, Malozowski S, Merriam GR, Shalet SM, Vance ML; Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee, Stephens PA | title = Evaluation and treatment of adult growth hormone deficiency: an Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline | journal = J. Clin. Endocrino. Metab. | volume = 91 | issue = 5 | pages = 1621–34 |date=May 2006 | pmid = 16636129 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2005-2227  }}</ref> with the most common cause a pituitary adenoma, and others including a continuation of a childhood problem, other structural lesions or trauma, and very rarely idiopathic GHD.

Adults with GHD "tend to have a relative increase in fat mass and a relative decrease in muscle mass and, in many instances, decreased energy and quality of life".<ref name="Molitch et al. 2006"/>

Diagnosis of GH deficiency involves a multiple-step diagnostic process, usually culminating in GH stimulation tests to see if the patient's pituitary gland will release a pulse of GH when provoked by various stimuli.

==Psychological effects==

===Quality of life===

Several studies, primarily involving patients with [[Growth hormone deficiency|GH deficiency]], have suggested a crucial role of GH in both mental and emotional well-being and maintaining a high energy level. Adults with GH deficiency often have higher rates of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] than those without.<ref name="Prodam_2012">{{cite journal |vauthors=Prodam F, Caputo M, Belcastro S, Garbaccio V, Zavattaro M, Samà MT, Bellone S, Pagano L, Bona G, Aimaretti G | title = Quality of life, mood disturbances and psychological parameters in adult patients with GH deficiency | journal = Panminerva Med | volume = 54 | issue = 4 | pages = 323–31 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23123585 | doi = | url = }}</ref>  While [[Growth hormone#Replacement therapy|GH replacement therapy]] has been proposed to treat depression as a result of GH deficiency, the long-term effects of such therapy are unknown.<ref name="Prodam_2012"/>

===Cognitive function===

GH has also been studied in the context of [[cognitive function]], including learning and memory.<ref name="Nyberg_2013">{{cite journal |vauthors=Nyberg F, Hallberg M | title = Growth hormone and cognitive function | journal = Nat Rev Endocrinol | volume = 9 | issue = 6 | pages = 357–65 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23629538 | doi = 10.1038/nrendo.2013.78 }}</ref> GH in humans appears to improve cognitive function and may be useful in the treatment of patients with cognitive impairment that is a result of GH deficiency.<ref name="Nyberg_2013"/>

==Medical uses==
{{Main|Growth hormone treatment}}

===Replacement therapy===

Treatment with exogenous GH is indicated only in limited circumstances,<ref name="Molitch et al. 2006"/> and needs regular monitoring due to the frequency and severity of side-effects. GH is used as replacement therapy in adults with GH deficiency of either childhood-onset or adult-onset (usually as a result of an acquired pituitary tumor). In these patients, benefits have variably included reduced fat mass, increased lean mass, increased bone density, improved lipid profile, reduced cardiovascular risk factors, and improved psychosocial well-being.

===Other approved uses===

GH can be used to treat conditions that produce short stature but are not related to deficiencies in GH. However, results are not as dramatic when compared to short stature that is solely attributable to deficiency of GH.  Examples of other causes of shortness often treated with GH are [[Turner syndrome]], [[chronic renal failure]], [[Prader–Willi syndrome]], [[intrauterine growth restriction]], and severe [[idiopathic short stature]]. Higher ("pharmacologic") doses are required to produce significant acceleration of growth in these conditions, producing blood levels well above normal ("physiologic"). Despite the higher doses, side-effects during treatment are rare, and vary little according to the condition being treated.

One version of rHGH has also been FDA approved for maintaining muscle mass in [[wasting]] due to [[AIDS]].<ref name="pmid11367383">{{cite journal | author = Gilden D | title = Human growth hormone available for AIDS wasting | journal = GMHC Treat Issues | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–11 |date=January 1995 | pmid = 11367383 | doi = | url = }}</ref>

===Off-label use===
{{Main|HGH controversies}}

[[off-label use|Off-label]] prescription of HGH is controversial and may be illegal.<ref name="DEA: Genotropin">DEA, US Department of Justice. [http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_chem_info/hgh.pdf DEA: Genotropin] Quote: "The illicit distribution of hGH occurs as the result of physicians illegally prescribing it for off-label uses, and for the treatment of FDA-approved medical conditions without examination and supervision"</ref>

Claims for GH as an anti-aging treatment date back to 1990 when the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' published a study wherein GH was used to treat 12 men over 60.<ref name="pmid2355952">{{cite journal |vauthors=Rudman D, Feller AG, Nagraj HS, Gergans GA, Lalitha PY, Goldberg AF, Schlenker RA, Cohn L, Rudman IW, Mattson DE | title = Effects of human growth hormone in men over 60 years old | journal = N.

The authors of the study noted that these improvements were the opposite of the changes that would normally occur over a 10- to 20-year aging period.  Despite the fact the authors at no time claimed that GH had reversed the aging process itself, their results were misinterpreted as indicating that GH is an effective anti-aging agent.<ref name="pmid17227934">{{cite journal | author = Liu H, Bravata DM, [[Ingram Olkin|Olkin I]], Nayak S, Roberts B, Garber AM, Hoffman AR | title = Systematic review: the safety and efficacy of growth hormone in the healthy elderly | journal = Ann.

A Stanford University School of Medicine [[meta-analysis]] of clinical studies on the subject published in early 2007 showed that the application of GH on healthy elderly patients increased muscle by about 2&nbsp;kg and decreased body fat by the same amount.<ref name="pmid17227934"/> However, these were the only positive effects from taking GH.  No other critical factors were affected, such as bone density, cholesterol levels, lipid measurements, maximal oxygen consumption, or any other factor that would indicate increased fitness.<ref name="pmid17227934" /> Researchers also did not discover any gain in muscle strength, which led them to believe that GH merely let the body store more water in the muscles rather than increase muscle growth. This would explain the increase in lean body mass.

GH has also been used experimentally to treat [[multiple sclerosis]], to enhance [[weight loss]] in [[obesity]], as well as in [[fibromyalgia]], [[heart failure]], [[Crohn's disease]] and [[ulcerative colitis]], and burns. GH has also been used experimentally in patients with [[short bowel syndrome]] to lessen the requirement for intravenous [[total parenteral nutrition]].

In 1990, the US Congress passed an omnibus crime bill, the [[Crime Control Act of 1990]], that amended the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]], that classified [[anabolic steroids]] as [[controlled substances]] and added a new section that stated that a person who "knowingly distributes, or possesses with intent to distribute, human growth hormone for any use in humans other than the treatment of a disease or other recognized medical condition, where such use has been authorized by the Secretary of Health and Human Services" has committed a [[felony]].<ref>Mannfred A. Hollinger. Introduction to Pharmacology, Third Edition.

The [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] of the US Department of Justice considers off-label prescribing of HGH to be illegal, and to be a key path for illicit distribution of HGH.<ref name="DEA: Genotropin"/>  This section has also been interpreted by some doctors, most notably<ref>News Author: Laurie Barclay, MD, CME Author: Désirée Lie, MD, MSEd for Medscape.

Sometimes it's used appropriately. Sometimes it's not."<ref name=VF/>

===Side-effects===

Use of GH as a drug has been approved by the FDA for several indications.  This means that the drug has acceptable safety in light of its benefits when used in the approved way.   Like every drug, there are several side effects caused by GH, some common, some rare.   Injection-site reaction is common.  More rarely, patients can experience  joint swelling, joint pain, [[carpal tunnel syndrome]], and an increased risk of [[diabetes]].<ref name="pmid17227934" />   In some cases, the patient can produce an immune response against GH.  GH may also  be a risk factor for [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]].<ref name="pmid16284435">{{cite journal |vauthors=Freedman RJ, Malkovska V, LeRoith D, Collins MT | title = Hodgkin lymphoma in temporal association with growth hormone replacement | journal = Endocr.

One survey of adults that had been treated with replacement cadaver GH (which has not been used anywhere in the world since 1985) during childhood showed a mildly increased incidence of colon cancer and prostate cancer, but linkage with the GH treatment was not established.<ref name="pmid12147369">{{cite journal |vauthors=Swerdlow AJ, Higgins CD, Adlard P, Preece MA | title = Risk of cancer in patients treated with human pituitary growth hormone in the UK, 1959-85: a cohort study | journal = Lancet | volume = 360 | issue = 9329 | pages = 273–7 |date=July 2002 | pmid = 12147369 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)09519-3 }}</ref>

==Performance enhancement==
{{Main|Growth hormone in sports}}

The first description of the use of GH as a doping agent was Dan Duchaine's "Underground Steroid handbook" which emerged from California in 1982; it is not known where and when GH was first used this way.<ref name="pmid19467612">{{cite journal |vauthors=Holt RI, Erotokritou-Mulligan I, Sönksen PH | title = The history of doping and growth hormone abuse in sport | journal = Growth Horm.

Athletes in many sports have used human growth hormone in order to attempt to enhance their athletic performance. Some recent studies have not been able to support claims that human growth hormone can improve the athletic performance of professional male athletes.<ref name="pmid18347346">{{cite journal |vauthors=Liu H, Bravata DM, Olkin I, Friedlander A, Liu V, Roberts B, Bendavid E, Saynina O, Salpeter SR, Garber AM, Hoffman AR | title = Systematic review: the effects of growth hormone on athletic performance | journal = Ann.

However, because GH is a potent endogenous protein, it is very difficult to detect GH doping. In the United States, GH is legally available only by prescription from a medical doctor.

==Dietary supplements==

To capitalize on the idea that GH might be useful to combat aging, companies selling [[dietary supplement]]s have websites selling products linked to GH in the advertising text, with medical-sounding names described as "HGH Releasers". Typical ingredients include amino acids, minerals, vitamins, and/or herbal extracts, the combination of which are described as causing the body to make more GH with corresponding beneficial effects. In the United States, because these products are marketed as dietary supplements it is illegal for them to contain GH, which is a drug. Also, under United States law, products sold as dietary supplements cannot have claims that the supplement treats or prevents any disease or condition, and the advertising material must contain a statement that the health claims are not approved by the FDA. The FTC and the FDA do enforce the law when they become aware of violations.<ref name="urlAtlas Operations, Inc.">{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/ucm215918.htm | title = Atlas Operations, Inc. | author = Singleton ER | date = 2010-06-04 | work = Warning Letter | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration | accessdate = 2011-08-28 }}</ref>

==Agricultural use==

In the United States, it is legal to give a bovine GH to dairy cows to increase milk production, and is legal to use GH in raising cows for beef; see articles on [[Bovine somatotropin]], [[cattle feeding]], [[dairy farming]] and the [[beef hormone controversy]].

==Drug development history==
{{Main|Growth hormone treatment#History}}
The identification, purification and later synthesis of growth hormone is associated with [[Choh Hao Li]].  [[Genentech]] pioneered the first use of [[recombinant DNA|recombinant]] human growth hormone for human therapy in 1981.

Prior to its production by recombinant DNA technology, growth hormone used to treat deficiencies was extracted from the [[pituitary gland]]s of [[cadaver]]s.  Attempts to create a wholly synthetic HGH failed.  Limited supplies of HGH resulted in the restriction of HGH therapy to the treatment of idiopathic short stature.<ref name = "Maybe_1984">{{cite book | author = Maybe, Nancy G | editor = Arthur P.

In 1985, unusual cases of [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] were found in individuals that had received cadaver-derived HGH ten to fifteen years previously.  Based on the assumption that infectious prions causing the disease were transferred along with the cadaver-derived HGH, cadaver-derived HGH was removed from the market.<ref name = "isbn0-07-144011-9"/>

In 1985, biosynthetic human growth hormone replaced pituitary-derived human growth hormone for therapeutic use in the U.S. and elsewhere.

As of 2005, recombinant growth hormones available in the United States (and their manufacturers) included Nutropin ([[Genentech]]), Humatrope ([[Eli Lilly and Company|Lilly]]), Genotropin ([[Pfizer]]), Norditropin ([[Novo Nordisk|Novo]]),  and Saizen ([[Merck Serono]]).
