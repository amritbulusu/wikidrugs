'''Dichlorvos''' or 2,2-dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate (commonly abbreviated as '''DDVP'''<ref name="hazmap">{{Cite web|url=http://hazmap.nlm.nih.gov/category-details?id=248&table=copytblagents|title=Dichlorvos|date=August 2015|website=Haz-Map|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine|access-date=2015-10-13}}</ref>) is a [[organophosphate]], widely used as an [[insecticide]] to control household pests, in public health, and protecting stored product from insects. The compound has been commercially available since 1961 and has become controversial because of its prevalence in urban waterways and the fact that its toxicity extends well beyond insects.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=DAS|first1=SUCHISMITA|title=A review of Dichlorvos toxicity in fish|journal=Current World Environment Journal|volume=8|issue=1|doi=10.12944/CWE.8.1.08}}</ref>

== Invention ==
Dichlorvos was developed from nerve gas agents after the end of World War II in 1955.

== Use ==
It is effective against mushroom flies, [[aphid]]s, [[spider mite]]s, [[caterpillar]]s, [[thrips]], and [[whitefly|whiteflies]] in greenhouse, outdoor fruit, and vegetable crops. It is also used in the milling and grain handling industries and to treat a variety of parasitic worm infections in dogs, livestock, and humans. It is fed to livestock to control [[bot fly]] larvae in the manure. It acts against insects as both a contact and a stomach poison. It is available as an aerosol and soluble concentrate. It is also used in pet collars and "no-pest strips" in the form of a pesticide-impregnated plastic; this material has been available to households since 1964 and has been the source of some concern, partly due to its misuse.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=W.

==Mechanism of action==
Dichlorvos, like other organophosphate insecticides, acts on [[acetylcholinesterase]], associated with the nervous systems of insects. Evidence for other modes of action, applicable to higher animals, have been presented.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pancetti | first1 = F. | last2 = Olmos | first2 = C. | last3 = Dagnino-Subiabre | first3 = A. | last4 = Rozas | first4 = C. | last5 = Morales | first5 = B. | year = 2007 | title = Noncholinesterase Effects Induced by Organophosphate Pesticides and their Relationship to Cognitive Processes: Implication for the Action of Acylpeptide Hydrolase | url = | journal = J.

==Regulation==
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] have reviewed the safety data of dichlorvos several times.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mennear|first1=John H.|title=Dichlorvos: A Regulatory Conundrum|journal=Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology|volume=27|issue=3|pages=265–272|doi=10.1006/rtph.1998.1217}}</ref> In 1995 a voluntary agreement was reached with the supplier, [[Amvac Chemical Corporation]] which restricted the use of dichlovos in many, but not all, domestic uses, all aerial applications, and other uses.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dichlorvos (DDVP): Deletion of Certain Uses and Directions.|url=https://federalregister.gov/a/95-9166|publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency: Office of Pesticide Programs.|ref=Docket Control Number OPP-38511.|pages=19580–19581|date=April 19, 1995|quote=Docket Control Number OPP-38511.}}</ref> Additional voluntary cancellations were implemented in 2006, 2008 and 2010.

==Safety==
People can be exposed to dichlorvos in the workplace by breathing it in, skin absorption, swallowing it, and eye contact. The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set the legal limit ([[permissible exposure limit]]) for dichlorvos exposure in the workplace as 1&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup> over an 8-hour workday. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 1&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup> over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 100&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup>, dichlorvos is [[IDLH|immediately dangerous to life and health]].<ref name=":0" />

== Effects on humans ==
Since it is an [[Cholinesterase inhibitor|acetylcholinesterase inhibitor]], symptoms of dichlorvos exposure include weakness, headache, tightness in chest, blurred vision, salivation, sweating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, eye and skin irritation, [[miosis]] (pupil constriction), eye pain, runny nose, [[wheezing]], [[laryngospasm]], [[cyanosis]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[muscle fasciculation]], paralysis, dizziness, [[ataxia]], convulsions, [[hypotension]] (low blood pressure), and [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s.<ref name=":0">{{PGCH|0202}}</ref>

It is also known to have an impact on DNA growth,<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Preferential Effect of Dichlorvos(Vapona) on Bacteria deficient in DNA polymerase|url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/33/3/458.full.pdf|journal=Cancer Research}}</ref> and interfere with the human nervous system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrdc.org/experts/mae-wu/big-court-win-public-health-pesticide-dichlorvos-bad-childrens-health|title=Big Court win for public health|website=www.nrdc.org}}</ref>

== Ban in Europe ==
The insecticide has been banned in EU since 1998.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pan-europe.info/old/Resources/Links/Banned_in_the_EU.pdf|title=Which pesticides are banned in Europe?|date=2008|website=pan-europe.info}}</ref>

== Pop culture==
DDVP was mentioned in episode 3 of season 1 of [[Rosewood (TV series)]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Dichlorvos was mentioned in [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]]'s science fiction novel "[[The Sheep Look Up]]". One of the book's many vignettes tells of a woman who nearly dies, having taken barbiturates and gone to sleep in a closed room where a fly-killing strip doused with the material was placed.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Sheep Look Up|last=Brunner|first=John|publisher=Ballantine Books|year=1976|isbn=|location=New York|pages=220|lccn=72-79705}}</ref>
