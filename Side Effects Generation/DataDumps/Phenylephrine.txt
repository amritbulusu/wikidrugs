'''Phenylephrine''' is a selective [[alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor]] [[agonist]] of the [[substituted phenethylamine|phenethylamine]] [[chemical classification|class]] used primarily as a [[decongestant]], as an agent to [[mydriasis|dilate the pupil]], and to increase [[blood pressure]]. Phenylephrine is marketed as an alternative for the decongestant [[pseudoephedrine]], although [[clinical trial]]s show phenylephrine, taken orally at the recommended dose, to be no more effective than [[placebo]] for allergy relief.<ref name="danzig09">{{Cite journal

==Medical uses==

===Decongestant===
Phenylephrine is used as a [[decongestant]] sold as an oral medicine or as a [[nasal spray]]. It is a common ingredient in [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] decongestants in the United States.  Other decongestants include [[oxymetazoline]] and [[pseudoephedrine]].

Phenylephrine is used as an alternative for pseudoephedrine in decongestant medicines due to pseudoephedrine's use in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine. Its efficacy as an oral decongestant has been questioned, with several recent independent studies finding that it provided no more relief to sinus congestion than a placebo.<!-- From Danzig09:"Phenylephrine was not significantly different from placebo in the primary end point" and Yao09: "There were no statistically significant differences between phenylephrine and placebo for any measures" --><ref name="danzig09"/><ref name="yao09"/>

Pharmacists Leslie Hendeles and Randy Hatton of the [[University of Florida]] suggested in 2006 that oral phenylephrine is ineffective as a decongestant at the 10-mg dose used, arguing that the studies used for the regulatory approval of the drug in the United States in 1976 were inadequate to prove effectiveness at the 10-mg dose, and safety at higher doses.<ref name="Hendeles2006">{{cite journal|author1=Heldeles, L.  |author2=Hatton, R. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Oral phenylephrine: An ineffective replacement for pseudoephedrine?|journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|volume=118|issue=1|pages=279–280|pmid=16815167|year=2006|doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2006.03.002}}</ref>

A 2007 meta-analysis by Hatton et al. concluded that the evidence for its effectiveness is insufficient,<ref name="Annals">{{cite journal|author=Hatton, R.C.|url=http://www.theannals.com/cgi/content/abstract/aph.1H679v1|title=Efficacy and Safety of Oral Phenylephrine: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis|journal=Annals of Pharmacotherapy|volume=41|pages=381–390|doi=10.1345/aph.1H679|pmid=17264159|year=2007|format=abstract|issue=3|display-authors=etal}}(published online Jan 2007)</ref> though another meta-analysis published shortly thereafter by researchers from [[GlaxoSmithKline]] found the standard 10-mg dose to be significantly more effective than a placebo; however, the fact that GSK markets many products containing phenylephrine has raised some speculation regarding selective publishing and other controversial techniques.<ref name="GSK">{{Cite journal

===Hemorrhoids===
[[Hemorrhoids]] are caused by swollen [[veins]] in the [[rectal]] area.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemorrhoids/basics/definition/con-20029852 Hemorrhoids - Mayo Clinic<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Phenylephrine can be used topically to prevent symptoms of hemorrhoids.  Phenylephrine causes the constriction of vascular smooth muscle and is often used in the treatment of hemorrhoids presumably to narrow the swollen veins and relieve the attendant pain. However, veins—unlike arteries—contain less vascular smooth muscle in their walls so the mechanism by which pain relief is achieved is likely related to something other than vascular change alone. Products for treatment may also include substances that will form a protective barrier over the inflamed area, resulting in less pain when [[faeces]] are passed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-76444-phenylephrine+HCl+Rect.aspx?drugid=76444&drugname=phenylephrine+HCl+Rect|title=phenylephrine rectal|work=webmd.com|accessdate=4 April 2015}}</ref>

===Pupil dilation===
{{redirect|Prefrin|the iron supplement|Proferrin}}
Phenylephrine is used as an eye drop to dilate the pupil to facilitate visualization of the retina. It is often used in combination with [[tropicamide]] as a synergist when tropicamide alone is not sufficient. Narrow-angle [[glaucoma]] is a [[contraindication]] to phenylephrine use. As a [[mydriasis|mydriatic]], it is available in 2.5% and 10% minims. Phenylephrine eye drops are applied to the eye after a topical anesthetic is applied.<ref>[http://akorn.com/documents/catalog/sell_sheets/17478-205-10.pdf Layout 1<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Vasopressor===
Phenylephrine is commonly used as a [[vasopressor]] to increase the blood pressure in unstable patients with [[hypotension]], especially resulting from septic shock. Such use is common in anesthesia or critical-care practices; it is especially useful in counteracting the hypotensive effect of [[epidural]] and [[subarachnoid]] [[anesthetics]], as well as the vasodilating effect of bacterial toxins and the inflammatory response in [[sepsis]] and [[systemic inflammatory response syndrome]].  The elimination half life of phenylephrine is about 2.5 to 3.0 hours.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kanfer | first1 = I | last2 = Dowse | first2 = R | last3 = Vuma | first3 = V | year = 1993 | title = Pharmacokinetics of oral decongestants | url = | journal = Pharmacotherapy | volume = 13 | issue = 6| pages = 116S-128S; discussion 143S-146S| pmid = 7507589 }}</ref> The clinical effects of a single intravenous bolus dose of phenylephrine are short lived and needs to be repeated every 10–15 minutes. Commonly the drug is given as a carefully titrated  intravenous infusion with a syringe pump or volumetric pump.

Because of its vasoconstrictive effect, phenylephrine can cause severe [[necrosis]] if it infiltrates the surrounding tissues. Because of this, it should be given through a central line if at all possible. Damage may be prevented or mitigated by infiltrating the tissue with the alpha blocker phentolamine by subcutaneous injection.<ref>Cooper, B. E. (2008). Review and Update on Inotropes and Vasopressors. AACN Advanced Critical Care, 19, 5–15.</ref>

Phenylephrine hydrochloride at 0.25% is used as a vasoconstrictor in some [[suppository]] formulations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=a23ded81-78ba-c199-a8f0-aaf360b216ff|title=DailyMed - PREPARATION H- cocoa butter and phenylephrine hydrochloride suppository|work=nih.gov|accessdate=4 April 2015}}</ref>

===Priapism===
Phenylephrine is used by urologists to abort [[priapism]]. It is diluted with normal saline and injected directly into the [[Corpus cavernosum penis|corpora cavernosa]]. The mechanism of action is to cause constriction of the blood vessels entering into the penis, thus causing decreased blood flow and relieving the priapism.  An injection is given every 3–5 minutes.  If priapism is not resolved in 1 hour, another form of therapy is considered.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.auanet.org/education/guidelines/priapism.cfm|title=Priapism : American Urological Association|work=auanet.org|accessdate=4 April 2015}}</ref>

==Side effects==

===Heart===
The primary side effect of phenylephrine is [[hypertension|high blood pressure]]. People with high blood pressure are typically advised to avoid  products containing it. Because this medication is a [[sympathomimetic]] amine without beta-adrenergic activity, it does not increase contractility force and output of the cardiac muscle. It may increase blood pressure resulting in a [[Reflex bradycardia|slow heart rate]] through stimulation of vascular (likely carotid) baroreceptors. A common side effect during IV administration is reflex bradycardia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reference.medscape.com/drug/vazculep-phenylephrine-342444|title=Medscape: Medscape Access|work=medscape.com|accessdate=4 April 2015}}</ref> The low concentration eye drops do not cause blood pressure changes and the changes with the higher dose drops do not last long.<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Stavert B, McGuinness MB, Harper CA, Guymer RH, Finger RP |title=Cardiovascular Adverse Effects of Phenylephrine Eyedrops: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis |journal=JAMA Ophthalmol |volume=133 |issue=6 |pages=647–52 |year=2015 |pmid=25789577 |doi=10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2015.0325 |url=}}</ref>

===Other===
[[Prostatic hyperplasia]] can also be worsened by use, and chronic use can lead to rebound [[hyperemia]].<ref name=pharmnemonics>{{Cite book|author=Shen, Howard|title=Illustrated Pharmacology Memory Cards: PharMnemonics|year=2008|publisher=Minireview|isbn=1-59541-101-1|page=3}}</ref> People with a history of anxiety or panic disorders, or on anticonvulsant medication for epilepsy should not take this substance.

Phenylephrine is pregnancy category C.  Due to the lack of studies done in animals and in humans, it is not known whether there is harm to the fetus.  Phenylephrine should only be given to pregnant women who have a clear need.<ref name="accessdata.fda.gov"/>

Extended use may cause [[rhinitis medicamentosa]], a condition of [[Rebound effect|rebound]] [[nasal congestion]].<ref name = nasal>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/mmx/neo-synephrine-nasal-spray.html|title=Neo-Synephrine Nasal Spray Drug Information, Professional|work=drugs.com|accessdate=4 April 2015}}</ref>

===Interactions===
The increase in [[blood pressure]] effect of phenylephrine may be increased by drugs such as [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s, [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s, and [[hydrocortisone]].  Patients taking these medications may need a lower dose of phenylephrine to achieve a similar increase in blood pressure.

Drugs that may decrease the effects of phenylephrine may include [[calcium channel blockers]], [[ACE inhibitors]] and [[benzodiazepine]]s.  Patients taking these medications may need a higher dose of phenylephrine to achieve a comparable increase in blood pressure.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/gview?wmode=transparent&url=http://www.vazculep.com/project_images/Vazculep_FINAL_PI.pdf&chrome=true|title=Vazculep_FINAL_PI.pdf|work=google.com|accessdate=4 April 2015}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Oral phenylephrine is extensively [[metabolism|metabolized]] by [[monoamine oxidase]],<ref name = DB>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00388#identification|title=DrugBank: Phenylephrine (DB00388)|work=drugbank.ca|accessdate=4 April 2015}}</ref> an [[enzyme]] that is present on the outside of cells, throughout the body.<ref name="pmid15279563">{{cite journal | author = Shih JC, Chen K | title = Regulation of MAO-A and MAO-B gene expression | journal = Curr.

Phenylephrine selectively binds to alpha receptors which cause blood vessels to constrict. Phenylephrine may cause side effects such as headache, [[reflex bradycardia]], excitability, restlessness and cardiac arrhythmias. Phenylephrine is not suggested for use in patients with hypertension.<ref name="dailymed.nlm.nih.gov">{{cite web|url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=72348406-e74f-46c5-b93d-34d07cffe1fd|title=DailyMed - PHENYLEPHRINE HYDROCHLORIDE- phenylephrine hydrochloride injection|work=nih.gov|accessdate=4 April 2015}}</ref>

Whereas pseudoephedrine causes both vasoconstriction and increase of [[mucociliary clearance]] through its nonspecific adrenergic activity, phenylephrine's selective α-adrenergic agonism causes vasoconstriction alone, creating a difference in their methods of action.

==Substitute for pseudoephedrine==
Pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine are both used as decongestants; and, until recently, [[pseudoephedrine]] was much more commonly available in the United States. This has changed because provisions of the [[Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005]] placed restrictions on the sale of pseudoephedrine products to prevent the  [[clandestine chemistry|clandestine manufacture]] of [[methamphetamine]]. Since 2004, phenylephrine has been increasingly marketed as a substitute for pseudoephedrine; some manufacturers have changed the active ingredients of products to avoid the restrictions on sales.<ref name="HeraldTribune"/>  Phenylephrine has been off [[patent]] for some time, and many generic brands are available.
