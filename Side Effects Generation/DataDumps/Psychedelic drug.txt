A '''psychedelic drug''' or '''classical [[hallucinogen]]''' is a [[drug|substance]] whose primary action is to alter [[cognition]] and [[perception]], typically as a [[serotonin receptor agonist]],<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v21/n1s/full/1395318a.html|title=Serotonin and Hallucinogens|work=Neuropsychopharmacology Reviews | doi=10.1016/S0893-133X(98)00135-3|volume=21|pages=16S–23S}}</ref> causing thought and visual/auditory changes, and heightened state of consciousness.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/apr/19/brain-scans-reveal-mind-opening-response-to-psychedelic-drug-trip-lsd-ketamine-psilocybin Psychedelic drugs induce 'heightened state of consciousness', brain scans show], guardian.com. Retrieved: 23.04.2017.</ref> Major psychedelic drugs include [[LSD]], [[mescaline]] (peyote's active ingredient), [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] and [[Hallucinogenic mushrooms|hallucinogenic mushrooms]].

Differing with other psychoactive drugs, such as [[stimulant]]s and [[opioid]]s, psychedelics tend to qualitatively alter ordinary conscious experience. Whereas stimulants cause energized feelings and opioids produce a relaxed euphoric state, the [[psychedelic experience]] is often compared to non-ordinary forms of consciousness such as [[trance]], [[meditation]], [[yoga]], [[religious ecstasy]], [[dream]]ing and even [[near-death experience]]s.  Most psychedelic drugs fall into one of the three families of chemical compounds: [[tryptamine]]s, [[phenethylamine]]s, or [[lysergamides]].

Many psychedelic drugs are illegal worldwide under the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs|UN conventions]], occasionally excepting use in a religious or research context. Despite these controls, recreational use of psychedelics is common.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=28 March 2013|title=Over 30 million psychedelic users in the United States|url=|journal=F1000Research|volume=2|pages=|doi=10.12688/f1000research.2-98.v1|issn=2046-1402|pmc=3917651|pmid=24627778|vauthors=Krebs TS, Johansen PØ}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|date=August 2016|title=Clinical applications of hallucinogens: A review|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27454674|journal=Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology|volume=24|issue=4|pages=229–268|doi=10.1037/pha0000084|issn=1936-2293|pmc=5001686|pmid=27454674|via=|vauthors=Garcia-Romeu A, Kersgaard B, Addy PH}}</ref>

==Origin of term==
The term ''psychedelic'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ψυχή (''psyche'', "soul, mind") and δηλείν (''delein'', "to manifest"), hence "soul-manifesting", the implication being that psychedelics can access the soul and develop unused potentials of the human mind.<ref>A. Weil, W. Rosen. (1993), ''From Chocolate To Morphine:Everything You Need To Know About Mind-Altering Drugs''.New York, Houghton Mifflin Company. p. 93</ref> The word was coined in 1956 by British psychiatrist, [[Humphry Osmond]], the spelling loathed by American [[ethnobotanist]], [[Richard Schultes]], but championed by the American psychologist, [[Timothy Leary]].<ref>W. Davis (1996), "One River: Explorations and Discoveries in the Amazon Rain Forest". New York, Simon and Schuster, Inc. p. 120</ref>

[[Aldous Huxley]] had suggested to Humphry Osmond in 1956 his own coinage ''phanerothyme'' (Greek "phaneroein-" visible + Greek "thymos" soul, thus "visible soul").<ref>[https://ia700700.us.archive.org/20/items/mokshawritingson00aldo/mokshawritingson00aldo.pdf iia700700.us.archive.org]</ref> Recently, the term [[entheogenic]] has come into use to denote the use of psychedelic drugs in a religious/spiritual/mystical context.

==Traditional use==
Psychedelics have a long history of traditional use in medicine and religion, for their perceived ability to promote physical and mental healing. In this context, they are often known as [[entheogens]]. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] practitioners using [[List of psychedelic plants#Mescaline|mescaline-containing cacti]] (most notably [[peyote]], [[Echinopsis pachanoi|San Pedro]], and [[Echinopsis peruviana|Peruvian torch]]) have reported success against [[alcoholism]], and [[Mazatec people|Mazatec]] practitioners routinely use [[psilocybin mushroom]]s for divination and healing. [[Ayahuasca]], which contains the potent psychedelic [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], is used in Peru and other parts of South America for spiritual and physical healing as well as in religious festivals.

==Examples==
[[File:Adams-hand-net.jpg|thumb|Doses of [[lysergic acid diethylamide]] (LSD)]]
{{main article|List of psychedelic drugs}}
Classical or [[serotonergic psychedelic]]s (agonists for the [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub> serotonin receptors]]) include [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] (also known as "acid"), [[psilocin]] (the active constituent of [[psilocybin mushroom]]s, commonly known as "magic mushrooms" or "shrooms"), [[mescaline]] (the active constituent of [[peyote]]), and [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] (the active constituent of [[ayahuasca]] and an [[Endogeny|endogenous]] compound produced in the human body).

==Pharmacological classes and effects==

===Serotonergic or classical psychedelics (5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor agonists)===
This class of psychedelics includes the classical hallucinogens, including the [[lysergamides]] like [[LSD]] and [[ergine|LSA]], [[tryptamine]]s like [[psilocybin]] and [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], and [[phenethylamine]]s like [[mescaline]] and [[2C-B]]. Many of these psychedelics cause remarkably similar effects, despite their different chemical structure. However, many users report that the three families have subjectively different qualities in the "feel" of the experience, which are difficult to describe. At lower doses, these include sensory alterations, such as the warping of surfaces, shape suggestibility, and color variations. Users often report intense colors that they have not previously experienced, and repetitive geometric shapes are common. Higher doses often cause intense and fundamental alterations of sensory perception, such as [[synesthesia]] or the experience of additional spatial or temporal dimensions.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Luke | first1 = D. | year = 2010 | title = Rock art or Rorschach: Is there more to entoptics than meets the eye? | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/48412631/Rock-Art-or-Rorschach-Is-there-More-to-Entoptics-than-Meets-the-Eye-David-Luke | journal = Time and Mind | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 9–28 | doi=10.2752/175169710x12549020810371}}</ref> Some compounds, such as [[2C-B]], have extremely tight "dose curves", meaning the difference between a non-event and an overwhelming disconnection from reality can be very slight. There can be very substantial differences between the drugs, however. For instance, [[5-MeO-DMT]] rarely produces the visual effects typical of other psychedelics and [[ibogaine]] (a 'complex [[tryptamine]]') is also an [[NMDA receptor antagonist]] and [[kappa Opioid receptor|κ-opioid receptor]] agonist in addition to being an agonist for the [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors]], resulting in [[dissociative]] effects as well (see [[Psychedelic drug#Dissociatives (NMDA antagonists)|dissociatives]] below).

===Empathogen-entactogens (serotonin releasers)===
The [[empathogen-entactogen]]s are [[phenethylamine]]s of the [[Substituted methylenedioxyphenethylamines|MDxx]] class such as [[MDMA]], [[Methylenedioxyethylamphetamine|MDEA]], and [[3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine|MDA]]. Their effects are characterized by feelings of openness, euphoria, empathy, love, heightened self-awareness, and by mild audio and visual distortions (an overall enhancement of sensory experience is often reported). Their adoption by the rave subculture is probably due to the enhancement of the overall social and musical experience. MDA is atypical to this experience, often causing hallucinations and psychedelic effects in equal profundity to the chemicals in the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> agonist category, but with substantially less mental involvement, and is both a serotonin releaser and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor agonist.

===Dissociatives===

====NMDA antagonists====
Certain [[dissociative]] drugs acting via NMDA antagonism are known to produce what some might consider psychedelic effects.  The main differences between dissociative psychedelics and serotonergic hallucinogens are that the dissociatives cause more intense [[derealization]] and [[depersonalization]].<ref>Vollenweider FX, Geyer MA. (2001) [http://wiki.dmt-nexus.com/w/images/8/83/Psychosis_and_hallucinogens_consciousness_model.pdf A systems model of altered consciousness: integrating natural and drug-induced psychoses]. Brain Res Bull. 56: 495–507.</ref> For example, [[ketamine]] produces sensations of being disconnected from one's body and that the surrounding environment is unreal, as well as perceptual alterations seen with other psychedelics.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pomarol-Clotet | first1 = E | last2 = Honey | first2 = GD | last3 = Murray | first3 = GK | last4 = Corlett | first4 = PR | last5 = Absalom | first5 = AR | last6 = Lee | first6 = M | last7 = McKenna | first7 = PJ | last8 = Bullmore | first8 = ET | last9 = Fletcher | first9 = PC | year = 2006 | title = Psychological effects of ketamine in healthy volunteers.

====Other====
''[[Salvia divinorum]]'' is a dissociative that is sometimes classified as an ''atypical psychedelic''. The active molecule in the plant, [[salvinorin A]], is a [[kappa opioid receptor]] agonist, working on a part of the brain that deals with pain. Activation of this receptor is also linked to the dysphoria sometimes experienced by users of [[opioid]]s either therapeutically or recreationally. An unusual feature of ''S. divinorum'' is its high potency (dosage is in the microgram range) and extremely disorienting effects, which often include "entity contact", complete loss of reality-perception and user's experiencing their consciousness as being housed in different objects e.g. a pane of glass or a pencil. Additionally, [[muscimol]], the active constituent of ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'', may be regarded as a psychedelic, dissociative or [[deliriant]].

In addition, many countries have analogue acts that automatically forbid any drugs sharing similar chemical structures to common illicit substances regardless of whether they are harmful.
