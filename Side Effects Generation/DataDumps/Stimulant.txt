== Effects ==
===Acute===
Stimulants in therapeutic doses, such as those given to patients with [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]], increases ability to focus, vigor, sociability, libido and may elevate mood.  However, in higher doses stimulants may actually decrease the ability to focus, a principle of the [[Yerkes-Dodson Law]].  In higher doses stimulants may also produce euphoria, vigor, and decrease need for sleep.  Many, but not all, stimulants have [[ergogenic]] effects.  Drugs such as ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, amphetamine and methylphenidate have well documented ergogenic effects, while drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine have the opposite effect.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Avois|first1=L|last2=Robinson|first2=N|last3=Saudan|first3=C|last4=Baume|first4=N|last5=Mangin|first5=P|last6=Saugy|first6=M|title=Central nervous system stimulants and sport practice|journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine|date=7 January 2017|volume=40|issue=Suppl 1|pages=i16–i20|doi=10.1136/bjsm.2006.027557|pmc=2657493|issn=0306-3674}}</ref>  Neurocognitive enhancing effects of stimulants, specifically [[modafinil]], amphetamine and methylphenidate have been documented in healthy adolescents, and is a commonly cited reason among illicit drug users for use, particularly among college students in the context of studying.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bagot|first1=Kara Simone|last2=Kaminer|first2=Yifrah|title=Efficacy of stimulants for cognitive enhancement in non-attention deficit hyperactivity disorder youth: a systematic review|journal=Addiction |date=1 April 2014|volume=109|issue=4|pages=547–557|pmid=24749160|issn=1360-0443}}</ref>

In some cases psychiatric phenomenon may emerge such as [[stimulant psychosis]], [[paranoia]], and [[suicidal ideation]].  Acute toxicity has been reportedly associated with a homicide, paranoia, aggressive behavior, motor dysfunction, and [[punding]].

[[File:Methamphetamines.PNG|thumb|A chart comparing the chemical structures of different [[Template:Amphetamines|amphetamine derivatives]]]]
Classifying stimulants is difficult, because of the large number of classes the drugs occupy, and the fact that they may belong to multiple classes; for example, [[MDMA|ecstasy]] can be classified as a [[substituted methylenedioxyphenethylamine]], a [[substituted amphetamine]] and consequently, a [[substituted phenethylamine]].{{Citation needed|reason=who says they are hard to classify?|date=January 2017}}

When referring to stimulants, the parent drug (e.g., ''amphetamine'') will always be expressed in the singular{{According to whom|date=January 2017}}; with the word "substituted" placed before the parent drug ([[substituted amphetamine|''substituted amphetamines'']]).<!--Referring to the class as "amphetamines" is an abuse of language. Racemic, levo-, and dextro-amphetamine are "amphetamines"; methamphetamine and the like are substituted amphetamines or "amphetamine-type" compounds.-->

===Cocaine analogues===
{{Main article|List of cocaine analogues}}

Hundreds of cocaine analogues have been created, all of them usually maintaining a benzyloxy connected to the 3 carbon of a tropane.  Various modifications include substitutions on the benzene ring, as well as additions or substitutions in place of the normal carboxylate on the tropane 2 carbon.  Various compound with similar structure activity relationships to cocaine that aren't technically analogues have been developed as well.

==Mechanisms of action==
{{see also|central fatigue}}
Stimulants can have a wide variety of mechanisms.  Many stimulants exert their effects through manipulations of [[monoamine]] [[neurotransmission]].  Monoamines are a class of neurotransmitter relevant in reward, motivation, temperature regulation and pain sensation that include [[dopamine]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[serotonin]].  Stimulants usually block the reuptake or stimulate the efflux of dopamine and norepinephrine resulting in increased activity of their circuits.  Some stimulants, notably those with [[empathogen]]ic and [[hallucinogen]]ic effects alter serotonergic neurotransmission.  Interference with vesicular storage, activating [[TAAR1]], and reversing the flow of monoamine transporters may play a mechanism in the activity of these drugs.  Adrenergic stimulants, such as ephedrine, may act by directly binding and activating the receptors that norepinephrine and epinephrine normally bind to([[adrenergic receptor]]s), producing sympathomimetic effects.

Caffeine is a stimulant compound belonging to the [[xanthine]] class of chemicals naturally found in [[coffee]], [[tea]], and (to a lesser degree) [[Cocoa solids|cocoa]] or [[chocolate]]. It is included in many [[soft drink]]s, as well as a larger amount in [[energy drink]]s. Caffeine is the world's most widely used psychoactive drug and by far the most common stimulant. In North America, 90% of adults consume caffeine daily.<ref name="demon drink">{{cite journal|author=Lovett R |title=Coffee: The demon drink? |journal=New Scientist |issue=2518 |date=24 September 2005 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=mg18725181.700 |accessdate=3 August 2009}} {{subscription required}}</ref> A few jurisdictions restrict its sale and use. Caffeine is also included in some medications, usually for the purpose of enhancing the effect of the primary ingredient, or reducing one of its side-effects (especially drowsiness).

=== Ephedrine ===
{{Main article|Ephedrine}}
Ephedrine is a [[sympathomimetic]] [[amine]] similar in molecular structure to the well-known drugs [[phenylpropanolamine]] and [[methamphetamine]], as well as to the important [[neurotransmitter]] [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline). Ephedrine is commonly used as a stimulant, [[appetite suppressant]], concentration aid, and [[decongestant]], and to treat [[hypotension]] associated with anaesthesia.

In chemical terms, it is an [[alkaloid]] with a [[phenethylamine]] skeleton found in various plants in the genus ''[[Ephedra (genus)|Ephedra]]'' (family [[Ephedraceae]]). It works mainly by increasing the activity of [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline) on [[adrenergic receptors]].<ref name=merck>[http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/lexicomp/ephedrine.html Merck Manuals EPHEDrine] Last full review/revision January 2010</ref> It is most usually marketed as the ''hydrochloride'' or ''sulfate'' salt.

The herb ''má huáng'' (''[[Ephedra sinica]]''), used in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] (TCM), contains ephedrine and [[pseudoephedrine]] as its principal active constituents. The same may be true of other herbal products containing extracts from other ''Ephedra'' species.

It comes in the form of tablets or a powder, which users can swallow, snort, or inject, producing similar effects to [[MDMA]], [[amphetamine]]s, and [[cocaine]].

Mephedrone was first synthesized in 1929, but did not become widely known until it was rediscovered in 2003. By 2007, mephedrone was reported to be available for sale on the Internet; by 2008 law enforcement agencies had become aware of the compound; and, by 2010, it had been reported in most of Europe, becoming particularly prevalent in the United Kingdom. Mephedrone was first made illegal in Israel in 2008, followed by Sweden later that year. In 2010, it was made illegal in many European countries, and, in December 2010, the EU ruled it illegal. In Australia, New Zealand, and the USA, it is considered an [[structural analog|analog]] of other illegal drugs and can be controlled by laws similar to the [[Federal Analog Act]]. In September 2011, the USA temporarily classified mephedrone as illegal, in effect from October 2011.

=== Methylphenidate ===
{{Main article|Methylphenidate}}Methylphenidate is a stimulant drug that is often used in the treatment of ADHD and narcolepsy and occasionally to treat obesity in combination with diet restraints and exercise. Its effects at therapeutic doses include increased focus, increased alertness, decreased appetite, decreased need for sleep and decreased impulsivity. Methylphenidate is not usually used recreationally, but when it is used, its effects are very similar to those of amphetamines.

Methylphenidate acts a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, by blocking the [[norepinephrine transporter]] (NET) and the [[dopamine transporter]] (DAT). Methylphenidate has a higher affinity for the dopamine transporter than for the norepinephrine transporter, and so its effects are mainly due to elevated dopamine levels caused by the inhibited reuptake  of dopamine, however increased norepinephrine levels also contribute to various of the effects caused by the drug.

Methylphenidate is sold in many forms, its most common trade name is the oral tablet '''Ritalin'''. Other versions include the long lasting tablet '''Concerta''' and the long lasting transdermal patch '''Daytrana'''.

Propylhexedrine is not an amphetamine, though it is structurally similar; it is instead a [[cycloalkylamine]], and thus has stimulant effects that are less potent than similarly structured amphetamines, such as methamphetamine.

The abuse potential of propylhexedrine is fairly limited, due its limited routes of administration: in the United States, Benzedrex is only available as an inhalant, mixed with lavender oil and menthol. These ingredients cause unpleasant tastes, and abusers of the drug have reported unpleasant "menthol burps."

=== Cocaine ===
{{Main article|Cocaine}}

Cocaine is an [[SNDRI]]. Cocaine is made from the leaves of the [[coca]] shrub, which grows in the mountain regions of South American countries such as [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], and [[Peru]]. In Europe, North America, and some parts of Asia, the most common form of cocaine is a white crystalline powder. Cocaine is a stimulant but is not normally prescribed therapeutically for its stimulant properties, although it sees clinical use as a local anesthetic, in particular in [[ophthalmology]]. Most cocaine use is recreational and its abuse potential is high (higher than amphetamine), and so its sale and possession are strictly controlled in most jurisdictions. Other [[tropane]] derivative drugs related to cocaine are also known such as [[troparil]] and [[lometopane]] but have not been widely sold or used recreationally.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=AJ Giannini |author2=WC Price |title=Contemporary drugs of abuse |journal=American Family Physician |volume=33 |pages=207–213 |year=1986}}</ref>

== Abuse ==
{{Main article|Recreational drug use#Stimulants}}
{{See also|Substance abuse}}

[[Drug abuse|Abuse]] of [[central nervous system]] (CNS) stimulants is common. [[Substance use disorder|Addiction]] to some CNS stimulants can quickly lead to [[medical]], [[psychiatric]], and [[psychosocial]] deterioration. [[Drug tolerance]], [[drug dependence|dependence]], and [[sensitization]] as well as a [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] syndrome can occur.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Dackis CA, Gold MS |title=Addictiveness of central stimulants |journal=Advances in Alcohol & Substance Abuse |volume=9 |issue=1–2 |pages=9–26 |year=1990 |pmid=1974121 |doi=10.1300/J251v09n01_02}}</ref>

Stimulants enhance the activity of the [[central nervous system|central]] and [[peripheral nervous system]]s. Common effects may include increased [[alertness]], [[awareness]], [[wakefulness]], [[endurance]], [[productivity]], and [[motivation]], [[arousal]], [[animal locomotion|locomotion]], [[heart rate]], and [[blood pressure]], and a diminished desire for [[food]] and [[sleep]].

Use of stimulants may cause the body to reduce significantly its production of natural body chemicals that fulfill similar functions. Until the body reestablishes its normal state, once the effect of the ingested stimulant has worn off the user may feel depressed, lethargic, confused, and miserable. This is referred to as a "crash", and may provoke reuse of the stimulant.

Stimulants may be screened for in animal discrimination and self-administration models which have high sensitivity albeit low specificity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Huskinson|first1=Sally L.|last2=Naylor|first2=Jennifer E.|last3=Rowlett|first3=James K.|last4=Freeman|first4=Kevin B.|title=PREDICTING ABUSE POTENTIAL OF STIMULANTS AND OTHER DOPAMINERGIC DRUGS: OVERVIEW AND RECOMMENDATIONS|journal=Neuropharmacology|date=7 January 2017|volume=0|pages=66–80|doi=10.1016/j.neuropharm.2014.03.009|pmc=4171344|issn=0028-3908}}</ref>  Research on a progressive ratio [[Self-administration]] protocol has found amphetamine, methylphenidate, modafinil, cocaine, and nicotine to all have a higher break point than placebo that scales with dose indicating reinforcing effects.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Stoops|first1=William W.|title=Reinforcing Effects of Stimulants in Humans: Sensitivity of Progressive-Ratio Schedules|journal=Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology|date=7 January 2017|volume=16|issue=6|pages=503–512|doi=10.1037/a0013657|pmc=2753469|issn=1064-1297}}</ref>

== Testing ==
The presence of stimulants in the body may be tested by a variety of procedures. Serum and urine are the common sources of testing material although saliva is sometimes used. Commonly used tests include chromatography, immunologic assay, and mass spectrometry.<ref>AJ Giannini. ''Drug Abuse''. Los Angeles, Health Information Press, 1999, pp.203–208</ref>
