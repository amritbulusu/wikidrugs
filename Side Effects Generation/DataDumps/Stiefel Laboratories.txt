==History==
The company's origins lie in the J.D. Stiefel Company which was established in 1847, in [[Germany]], by John David Stiefel; its first products were [[candles]] but the company began making medicated [[soap]]s within several years of its founding. In the 1880s, the company began worldwide export of its products.<ref name="stiefel1946">{{cite web|url=http://www.stiefel.com/about-stiefel/1847-1946.html |title=Stiefel, a GSK company- History 1847 - 1946 |publisher=Stiefel.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-14}}</ref>

The company's products were brought to the [[United States]] for the first time by August C. Stiefel, the grandson of J.D. Stiefel (the founder), in 1910 and named the company Stiefel Medicinal Soap Co., Inc.<ref name="stiefel1946"/>

By 1914, Stiefel produced 103 different toilet, perfumed, and medicinal soaps and were packaged in seven different languages.<ref name="stiefel1946"/>

One of J.D. Stiefel Company’s original products in the 1920s, was called [[Stiefel Freckle Soap]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} In early advertisements, Freckle Soap claimed to wash “[[freckles]] and unsightly tan” away. At this time, soaps were packaged in tins to prolong the product’s shelf life.<ref name="stiefel1946"/>

In 1947 the business was resurrected, and registered in the [[New York (state)|State of New York]] under the name the Stiefel Medicinal Soap Company, Inc., initially operating from a former creamery in Oak Hill, [[New York City|New York]]. As the product line grew and diversified beyond medicinal soaps, the company was renamed Stiefel Laboratories, Inc.<ref name="stiefel1947">{{cite web|url=http://www.stiefel.com/about-stiefel/1947-1979.html |title=Stiefel, a GSK company- History 1947 - 1979 |publisher=Stiefel.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-14}}</ref>

In 1948, the Stiefel Medicinal Soap Company worked with dermatologists to develop the [[Oilatum]] family of products, which treat dry skin and [[atopic dermatitis]].<ref name="stiefel1947"/>

In 1959, [[Zeasorb]] has the ability to absorb six times its weight in moisture. Stiefel developed Zeasorb products with dermatologists, who identified the need for such a powder.

Introduced in 1960, [[Polytar]] first featured the combination of tars in a shampoo.<ref name="stiefel1947"/>

In 1966, Stiefel introduced the first [[benzoyl peroxide]] product for acne—[[Sulfoxyl Lotion]] (5% benzoyl peroxide, 2% sulfur). The treatment was introduced to Canadian dermatologists as [[BenOxyl Lotion]].<ref name="stiefel1947"/>

As the Stiefel Medicinal Soap Company’s product line grew and diversified beyond medicinal soaps, the company name was changed to Stiefel Laboratories, Inc. At that time, all production was done at the Oak Hill, New York, facility. Eventually its network of distributors, subsidiaries and manufacturing facilities in other countries allowed the company to manufacture and distribute products around the globe. During the 1960s, sales and manufacturing operations expanded to include Canada, Puerto Rico, Germany, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, Costa Rica, the Philippines, Ireland and other locations.

By 1969, non-US international sales had reached $200,000. In the 1970s, the company expanded into South and Central America, the Caribbean, and France. The distributorship in Canada became a subsidiary, and manufacturing operations began in Sligo, Ireland. Between 1970 and 1979, the company averaged fifty percent growth every year and sales grew to $10.4 million.<ref name="stiefel1947"/>

In 1977 the headquarters were relocated to [[Coral Gables]], Florida.<ref name="stiefel1947"/>

During the 1980s, Stiefel’s first [[research and development]] facility outside of the US was established in 1985 in [[Slough]], a town near the company’s United Kingdom headquarters. (It was later moved to [[Maidenhead]].)<ref name="stiefel1980">{{cite web|url=http://www.stiefel.com/about-stiefel/year-1980-present.html |title=Stiefel, a GSK company – History 1980 - Present |publisher=Stiefel.com |date=2008-08-06 |accessdate=2011-12-14}}</ref>

Another R&D facility was established in Brazil. At the close of the 1980s international sales had grown to nearly $50 million. The company’s operations continued to expand and by the 1990s Stiefel Laboratories had subsidiaries in more than 30 countries and relationships with distributors in 70 others.  By the end of the decade, factories were operating in [[Ireland]], [[Brazil]], [[Singapore]] and [[Mexico]], supplying markets around the world.  Sales had reached $180 million.<ref name="stiefel1980"/>

In 1991, Stiefel Laboratories founded [[Glades Pharmaceuticals]] to market generic dermatology products. Glades Pharmaceuticals later matured to market a full line of products including branded-generic and branded products. [[Brevoxyl/Solugel Creamy Wash]] is launched as the first benzoyl peroxide product containing [[dimethyl isosorbide]] to dissolve the benzoyl peroxide crystals and reduce irritation.<ref name="stiefel1980"/>

In 2000, Stiefel Introduced [[Physiogel]], a brand of skin care products.<ref name="stiefel1980"/>

In 2006, Stiefel Laboratories makes its first major corporate acquisition when it acquires California-based [[Connetics Corporation]], a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapeutics for the dermatology market.<ref name="stiefel1980"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Business Wire |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20061023005508/en/Connetics-Corporation-Stiefel-Laboratories-Sign-Definitive-Merger |title=Connetics Corporation and Stiefel Laboratories, Inc. Sign Definitive Merger Agreement |publisher=Business Wire |date=2006-10-23 |accessdate=2011-12-14}}</ref>

In 2007, [[Revaléskin]] was introduced formulated with the antioxidant ingredient, [[CoffeeBerry]].<ref name="stiefel1980"/>

William D. (Bill) Humphries was promoted to president of Stiefel Laboratories, Inc., the privately held dermatology company in 2008. An acquisition of Barrier Therapeutics, Inc. (“Barrier Therapeutics”) on August 6, 2008 was also completed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wraltechwire.com/business/tech_wire/biotech/story/2514433/ |title=Stiefel Labs Goes Outside Founding Family in Choice for President |publisher=WRAL Tech Wire |date=2008-03-03 |accessdate=2011-12-14}}</ref>

Stiefel was acquired by GlaxoSmithKline in July 2009 to create a new specialist dermatology business. As part of the acquisition, Stiefel Laboratories is now branded "Stiefel, a GSK company" in advertising.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsk.com/media/pressreleases/2009/2009_pressrelease_10078.htm |title=GlaxoSmithKline completes acquisition of Stiefel |publisher=Gsk.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-14}}</ref>
