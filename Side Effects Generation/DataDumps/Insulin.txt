<!-- Clinical significance -->
If beta cells are destroyed by an [[autoimmunity|autoimmune reaction]], insulin can no longer be synthesized or be secreted into the blood. This results in [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes mellitus]], which is characterized by abnormally high blood glucose concentrations, and generalized body wasting.<ref name="urlInsulin Injection - PubMed Health">{{cite web | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0000729 | title = Insulin Injection  | author = American Society of Health-System Pharmacists  | date = 2009-02-01 | work = PubMed Health | publisher = National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine | accessdate = 2012-10-12 }}</ref> In [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes mellitus]] the destruction of beta cells is less pronounced than in type 1 diabetes, and is not due to an autoimmune process.

<!-- Structure -->
The human insulin protein is composed of 51 [[amino acid]]s, and has a [[molecular mass]] of 5808 [[Dalton (unit)|Da]]. It is a [[protein dimer|dimer]] of an A-chain and a B-chain, which are linked together by [[disulfide bond]]s. Insulin's structure varies slightly between [[species]] of animals. Insulin from animal sources differs somewhat in effectiveness (in [[carbohydrate metabolism]] effects) from human insulin because of these variations. [[Pig|Porcine]] insulin is especially close to the [[human]] version, and was widely used to treat type 1 diabetics before human insulin could be produced in large quantities by [[Recombinant DNA#Applications of recombinant DNA technology|recombinant DNA]] technologies.<ref name=recombination>Drug Information Portal NLM – Insulin human USAN http://druginfo.nlm.nih.gov/drugportal/</ref><ref name="urlGenentech">{{cite web|url=http://www.gene.com/media/press-releases/4160/1978-09-06/first-successful-laboratory-production-o|title=First Successful Laboratory Production of Human Insulin Announced|last=|first=|date=1978-09-06|website=|publisher=Genentech|access-date=|work=News Release|accessdate=2016-09-26}}</ref><ref name="urlRecombinant DNA technology in the synthesis of human insulin">{{cite web | url = http://www.littletree.com.au/dna.htm | title = Recombinant DNA technology in the synthesis of human insulin | author = Tof I  | year = 1994 | work = | publisher = Little Tree Publishing | accessdate = 2009-11-03 }}</ref><ref name="pmid23222785">{{cite journal | vauthors = Aggarwal SR | title = What's fueling the biotech engine-2011 to 2012 | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 30 | issue = 12 | pages = 1191–7 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23222785 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2437 }}</ref>

== Protein structure ==
{{See also|Insulin/IGF/Relaxin family|Insulin and its analog structure}}
Within vertebrates, the amino acid sequence of insulin is [[conserved sequence|strongly conserved]]. [[Cow|Bovine]] insulin differs from human in only three [[amino acid]] residues, and [[Pig|porcine]] insulin in one. Even insulin from some species of fish is similar enough to human to be clinically effective in humans. Insulin in some invertebrates is quite similar in sequence to human insulin, and has similar physiological effects. The strong homology seen in the insulin sequence of diverse species suggests that it has been conserved across much of animal evolutionary history. The C-peptide of [[proinsulin]] (discussed later), however, differs much more among species; it is also a hormone, but a secondary one.

Insulin is produced and stored in the body as a hexamer (a unit of six insulin molecules), while the active form is the monomer. The hexamer is an inactive form with long-term stability, which serves as a way to keep the highly reactive insulin protected, yet readily available. The hexamer-monomer conversion is one of the central aspects of insulin formulations for injection. The hexamer is far more stable than the monomer, which is desirable for practical reasons; however, the monomer is a much faster-reacting drug because diffusion rate is inversely related to particle size. A fast-reacting drug means insulin injections do not have to precede mealtimes by hours, which in turn gives people with diabetes more flexibility in their daily schedules.<ref name="pmid16158220">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dunn MF | title = Zinc-ligand interactions modulate assembly and stability of the insulin hexamer – a review | journal = Biometals | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 295–303 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16158220 | doi = 10.1007/s10534-005-3685-y }}</ref> Insulin can aggregate and form [[fibrillar]] interdigitated [[beta-sheet]]s.

== Synthesis, physiological effects, and degradation ==

=== Synthesis ===
Insulin is produced in the [[pancreas]] and the Brockmann body (in some fish), and released when any of several stimuli are detected. These stimuli include ingested protein and glucose in the blood produced from digested food.<ref name=MedicalPhysiology>{{cite book|last1=Rhoades|first1=Rodney A.|last2=Bell|first2=David R.| name-list-format = vanc | title=Medical physiology : principles for clinical medicine|date=2009|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-7817-6852-8|pages=644–647|edition=3rd}}</ref> [[Carbohydrate]]s can be polymers of simple sugars or the simple sugars themselves. If the carbohydrates include glucose, then that glucose will be absorbed into the bloodstream and blood glucose level will begin to rise. In target cells, insulin initiates a [[signal transduction]], which has the effect of increasing [[glucose]] uptake and storage. Finally, insulin is degraded, terminating the response.

[[File:Insulin path.svg|thumb|400px|Insulin undergoes extensive posttranslational modification along the production pathway. Production and secretion are largely independent; prepared insulin is stored awaiting secretion. Both C-peptide and mature insulin are biologically active. Cell components and proteins in this image are not to scale.]]

In mammals, insulin is synthesized in the pancreas within the beta cells. One million to three million pancreatic islets form the [[endocrine]] part of the pancreas, which is primarily an [[exocrine]] [[gland]]. The endocrine portion accounts for only 2% of the total mass of the pancreas. Within the pancreatic islets, beta cells constitute 65–80% of all the cells.

Insulin consists of two polypeptide chains, the A- and B- chains, linked together by disulfide bonds. It is however first synthesized as a single polypeptide called [[preproinsulin]] in beta cells. Preproinsulin contains a 24-residue [[signal peptide]] which directs the nascent polypeptide chain to the rough [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (RER).  The signal peptide is cleaved as the polypeptide is translocated into lumen of the RER, forming [[proinsulin]].<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=ohgjG0qAvfgC&pg=PA66#v=onepage&q&f=false |title= Joslin's Diabetes Mellitus |author= [[C. Ronald Kahn]]|edition=14th |pages= |publisher= Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |year=2005 |isbn=978-8493531836 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> In the RER the proinsulin folds into the correct conformation and 3 disulfide bonds are formed.  About 5–10 min after its assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum, proinsulin is transported to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) where immature granules are formed. Transport to the TGN may take about 30 min.

Proinsulin undergoes maturation into active insulin through the action of cellular endopeptidases known as [[prohormone convertase]]s ([[Proprotein convertase 1|PC1]] and [[proprotein convertase 2|PC2]]), as well as the exoprotease [[carboxypeptidase E]].<ref name="pmid16591494">{{cite journal | vauthors = Steiner DF, Oyer PE | title = The biosynthesis of insulin and a probable precursor of insulin by a human islet cell adenoma | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 473–80 | date = February 1967 | pmid = 16591494 | pmc = 335530 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.57.2.473 }}</ref>  The endopeptidases cleave at 2 positions, releasing a fragment called the [[C-peptide]], and leaving 2 peptide chains, the B- and A- chains, linked by 2 disulfide bonds.

=== Release ===
{{See also|Blood glucose regulation}}

[[Beta Cell|Beta cells]] in the [[islets of Langerhans]] release insulin in two phases. The first-phase release is rapidly triggered in response to increased blood glucose levels, and lasts about 10 minutes. The second phase is a sustained, slow release of newly formed vesicles triggered independently of sugar, peaking in 2 to 3 hours. Reduced first-phase insulin release may be the earliest detectable beta cell defect predicting onset of [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type&nbsp;2 diabetes]].<ref name="pmid11815469">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gerich JE | title = Is reduced first-phase insulin release the earliest detectable abnormality in individuals destined to develop type 2 diabetes? | journal = Diabetes | volume = 51 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = S117-21 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 11815469 | doi = 10.2337/diabetes.51.2007.s117}}</ref> First-phase release and [[Insulin resistance|insulin sensitivity]] are independent predictors of diabetes.<ref name="pmid20805282">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lorenzo C, Wagenknecht LE, Rewers MJ, Karter AJ, Bergman RN, Hanley AJ, Haffner SM | title = Disposition index, glucose effectiveness, and conversion to type 2 diabetes: the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS) | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 33 | issue = 9 | pages = 2098–103 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20805282 | pmc = 2928371 | doi = 10.2337/dc10-0165 }}</ref>

The description of first phase release is as follows:

* Glucose enters the β-cells through the [[glucose transporters]], [[GLUT2]]. These glucose transporters have a relatively low affinity for glucose, ensuring that the rate of glucose entry into the β-cells is proportional to the extracellular glucose concentration (within the physiological range).

* The calcium ion concentration in the cytosol of the beta cells can also, or additionally, be increased through the activation of [[phospholipase|phospholipase C]] resulting from the binding of an extracellular [[ligand]] (hormone or neurotransmitter) to a [[G protein]]-coupled membrane receptor. Phospholipase C cleaves the membrane phospholipid, [[phosphatidyl inositol 4,5-bisphosphate]], into [[inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate]] and [[diglyceride|diacylglycerol]]. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) then binds to receptor proteins in the plasma membrane of the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER). This allows the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions from the ER via IP3-gated channels, which raises the cytosolic concentration of calcium ions independently of the effects of a high blood glucose concentration.

This is the primary mechanism for release of insulin.

Release of insulin is strongly inhibited by [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline), which leads to increased blood glucose levels during stress.

When the glucose level comes down to the usual physiologic value, insulin release from the β-cells slows or stops. If the blood glucose level drops lower than this, especially to dangerously low levels, release of hyperglycemic hormones (most prominently [[glucagon]] from islet of Langerhans alpha cells) forces release of glucose into the blood from the liver glycogen stores, supplemented by [[gluconeogenesis]] if the glycogen stores become depleted. By increasing blood glucose, the hyperglycemic hormones prevent or correct life-threatening hypoglycemia.

Evidence of impaired first-phase insulin release can be seen in the [[glucose tolerance test]], demonstrated by a substantially elevated blood glucose level at 30 minutes after the ingestion of a glucose load (75 or 100 g of glucose), followed a slow drop over the next 100 minutes, to remain above 120&nbsp;mg/100 ml after two hours after the start of the test. In a normal person the blood glucose level is corrected (and may even be slightly over-corrected) by the end of the test.

=== Signal transduction ===
The effects of insulin are initiated by its binding to a receptor present in the cell membrane. The receptor molecule contains an α- and β subunits. Two molecules are joined to form what is known as a homodimer. Insulin binds to the α-subunits of the homodimer, which faces the extracellular side of the cells. The β subunits have tyrosine kinase enzyme activity which is triggered by the insulin binding. This activity provokes the autophosphorylation of the β subunits and subsequently the phosphorylation of proteins inside the cell known as insulin receptor substrates (IRS). The phosphorylation of the IRS activates a signal transduction cascade that leads to the activation of other kinases as well as transcription factors that mediate the intracellular effects of insulin.<ref name="diabetesincontrol.com">{{Cite news|url=http://www.diabetesincontrol.com/handbook-of-diabetes-4th-edition-excerpt-4-normal-physiology-of-insulin-secretion-and-action/|title=Handbook of Diabetes, 4th Edition, Excerpt #4: Normal Physiology of Insulin Secretion and Action|date=2014-07-28|work=Diabetes In Control.

The cascade that leads to the insertion of GLUT4 glucose transporters into the cell membranes of muscle and fat cells, and to the synthesis of glycogen in liver and muscle tissue, as well as the conversion of glucose into triglycerides in liver, adipose, and lactating mammary gland tissue, operates via the activation, by IRS-1, of phosphoinositol 3 kinase ([[phosphoinositide 3-kinase|PI3K]]). This enzyme converts a [[phospholipid]] in the cell membrane by the name of  [[phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate]] (PIP2), into [[Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate|phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate]] (PIP3), which, in turn, activates [[AKT|protein kinase B]] (PKB). Activated PKB facilitates the fusion of GLUT4 containing [[endosome]]s with the cell membrane, resulting in an increase in GLUT4 transporters in the plasma membrane.<ref name="pmid15791206">{{cite journal | vauthors = McManus EJ, Sakamoto K, Armit LJ, Ronaldson L, Shpiro N, Marquez R, Alessi DR | title = Role that phosphorylation of GSK3 plays in insulin and Wnt signalling defined by knockin analysis | journal = The EMBO Journal | volume = 24 | issue = 8 | pages = 1571–83 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15791206 | pmc = 1142569 | doi = 10.1038/sj.emboj.7600633 }}</ref> PKB also phosphorylates [[GSK-3|glycogen synthase kinase]] (GSK), thereby inactivating this enzyme.<ref name="pmid11035810">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fang X, Yu SX, Lu Y, Bast RC, Woodgett JR, Mills GB | title = Phosphorylation and inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 by protein kinase A | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 97 | issue = 22 | pages = 11960–5 | date = October 2000 | pmid = 11035810 | pmc = 17277 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.220413597 }}</ref> This means that its substrate, [[glycogen synthase]] (GS), cannot be phosphorylated, and remains dephosphorylated, and therefore active.

After the intracellular signal that resulted from the binding of insulin to its receptor has been produced, termination of signaling is then needed.  As mentioned below in the section on degradation, endocytosis and degradation of the receptor bound to insulin is a main mechanism to end signaling.<ref name="Najjar_2001" />  In addition, the signaling pathway is also terminated by dephosphorylation of the tyrosine residues in the various signaling pathways by tyrosine phosphatases.

=== Physiological effects ===
[[File:Insulin glucose metabolism ZP.svg|thumbnail|400px|'''Effect of insulin on glucose uptake and metabolism.''' Insulin binds to its receptor (1), which starts many protein activation cascades (2).

The actions of insulin on the global human metabolism level include:

* Increase of cellular intake of certain substances, most prominently glucose in muscle and [[adipose tissue]] (about two-thirds of body cells)<ref name="pmid21864752">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dimitriadis G, Mitrou P, Lambadiari V, Maratou E, Raptis SA | title = Insulin effects in muscle and adipose tissue | journal = Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice | volume = 93 Suppl 1 | issue =  | pages = S52-9 | date = August 2011 | url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eirini_Maratou/publication/221930616_Insulin_effects_in_muscle_and_adipose_tissue/links/00b7d527a370a8fd76000000.pdf  | pmid = 21864752 | doi = 10.1016/S0168-8227(11)70014-6 }}</ref>
* Increase of [[DNA replication]] and [[protein synthesis]] via control of amino acid uptake
* Modification of the activity of numerous [[enzymes]].

The actions of insulin (indirect and direct) on cells include:
* '''Stimulates the uptake of glucose''' –  Insulin decreases blood glucose concentration by inducing intake of glucose by the cell. This is possible because Insulin causes the insertion of the GLUT4 transporter in the cell membranes of muscle and fat tissues which allows glucose to enter the cell.  <ref name="diabetesincontrol.com"/>
* '''Induce glycogen synthesis''' – When glucose levels are high, insulin induces the formation of glycogen by the activation of the hexokinase enzyme, which adds a phosphate group in glucose, thus resulting in a molecule that cannot exit the cell. At the same time, insulin inhibits the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which removes the phosphate group. These two enzymes are key for the formation of glycogen. Also, insulin activates the enzymes phosphofructokinase and glycogen synthase which are responsible for glycogen synthesis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/endocrine/pancreas/insulin_phys.html|title=Physiologic Effects of Insulin|website=www.vivo.colostate.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-06-01}}</ref>

=== Degradation ===
Once an insulin molecule has docked onto the receptor and effected its action, it may be released back into the extracellular environment, or it may be degraded by the cell. The two primary sites for insulin clearance are the liver and the kidney. The liver clears most insulin during first-pass transit, whereas the kidney clears most of the insulin in systemic circulation. Degradation normally involves [[endocytosis]] of the insulin-receptor complex, followed by the action of [[insulin-degrading enzyme]]. An insulin molecule produced endogenously by the beta cells is estimated to be degraded within about one hour after its initial release into circulation (insulin [[biological half-life|half-life]] ~ 4–6&nbsp;minutes).<ref name="pmid">{{cite journal | vauthors = Duckworth WC, Bennett RG, Hamel FG | title = Insulin degradation: progress and potential | journal = Endocrine Reviews | volume = 19 | issue = 5 | pages = 608–24 | date = October 1998 | pmid = 9793760 | doi = 10.1210/er.19.5.608 }}</ref><ref name="urlCarbohydrate and insulin metabolism in chronic kidney disease">{{cite web | url = http://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbohydrate-and-insulin-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease | title = Carbohydrate and insulin metabolism in chronic kidney disease |vauthors=Palmer BF, Henrich WL | work = UpToDate, Inc }}</ref>

In insulin-resistant [[adipocyte]]s, patterns of insulin-induced enzyme expression is disturbed in a manner consistent with elevated EC [[Biosynthesis|synthesis]] and reduced EC degradation.

== Hypoglycemia ==
{{Main article|Hypoglycemia}}

Although other cells can use other fuels (most prominently fatty acids), [[neurons]] depend on glucose as a source of energy, unless the person is in [[ketosis]]. They do not require insulin to absorb glucose, unlike muscle and adipose tissue, and they have very small internal stores of glycogen. Glycogen stored in liver cells (unlike glycogen stored in muscle cells) can be converted to glucose, and released into the blood, when glucose from digestion is low or absent, and the [[glycerol]] backbone in triglycerides can also be used to produce blood glucose.

Sufficient lack of glucose and scarcity of these sources of glucose can dramatically make itself manifest in the impaired functioning of the [[central nervous system]]: dizziness, speech problems, and even loss of consciousness. Low blood glucose level is known as [[hypoglycemia]] or, in cases producing unconsciousness, "hypoglycemic coma" (sometimes termed "insulin shock" from the most common causative agent). Endogenous causes of insulin excess (such as an [[insulinoma]]) are very rare, and the overwhelming majority of insulin excess-induced hypoglycemia cases are [[Iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]] and usually accidental. A few cases of murder, attempted murder, or suicide using insulin overdoses have been reported, but most insulin shocks appear to be due to errors in dosage of insulin (e.g., 20 units instead of 2) or other unanticipated factors (did not eat as much as anticipated, or exercised more than expected, or unpredicted kinetics of the subcutaneously injected insulin itself).

Possible causes of hypoglycemia include:

* External insulin (usually injected subcutaneously)
* Oral hypoglycemic agents (e.g., any of the sulfonylureas, or similar drugs, which increase insulin release from β-cells in response to a particular blood glucose level)
* Ingestion of low-carbohydrate [[sugar substitute]]s in people without diabetes or with type 2 diabetes. Animal studies show these can trigger insulin release, albeit in much smaller quantities than sugar, according to a report in ''Discover'' magazine, August 2004, p 18. (This can never be a cause of hypoglycemia in patients with mature type 1 diabetes, since there is no endogenous insulin production to stimulate. It can occur during the honeymoon period, a period up to several years after a type 1 diabetes diagnosis during which endogenous insulin production still occurs.)

== Diseases and syndromes ==
There are several conditions in which insulin disturbance is pathologic:

* [[Diabetes mellitus]] – general term referring to all states characterized by hyperglycemia
** [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|Type 1]] – autoimmune-mediated destruction of insulin-producing β-cells in the pancreas, resulting in absolute insulin deficiency
** [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2]] – either inadequate insulin production by the β-cells or [[insulin resistance]] or both because of reasons not completely understood.
*** there is correlation with [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]], with sedentary lifestyle, with [[obesity]], with age and with [[metabolic syndrome]]. Causality has been demonstrated in multiple model organisms including mice and monkeys; Importantly, non-obese people do get Type 2 diabetes due to diet, sedentary lifestyle and unknown risk factors.
*** it is likely that there is genetic susceptibility to develop Type 2 diabetes under certain environmental conditions
** Other types of impaired glucose tolerance (see the [[Diabetes]])
* [[Insulinoma]] – a tumor of beta cells producing excess insulin or [[reactive hypoglycemia]].
* [[Metabolic syndrome]] – a poorly understood condition first called Syndrome X by [[Gerald Reaven]]. It is currently not clear whether the syndrome has a single, treatable cause, or is the result of body changes leading to type 2 diabetes. It is characterized by elevated blood pressure, dyslipidemia (disturbances in blood cholesterol forms and other blood lipids), and increased waist circumference (at least in populations in much of the developed world). The basic underlying cause may be the insulin resistance that precedes type 2 diabetes, which is a diminished capacity for [[Insulin#Physiological effects|insulin response]] in some tissues (e.g., muscle, fat). It is common for morbidities such as essential [[hypertension]], [[obesity]], type 2 diabetes, and [[cardiovascular disease]] (CVD) to develop.
* [[Polycystic ovary syndrome]] – a complex syndrome in women in the reproductive years where [[anovulation]] and [[androgen]] excess are commonly displayed as [[hirsutism]]. In many cases of PCOS, insulin resistance is present.

Several analogs of human insulin are available. These insulin analogs are closely related to the human insulin structure, and were developed for specific aspects of glycemic control in terms of fast action (prandial insulins) and long action (basal insulins).<ref>[[Insulin analog]]</ref> The first biosynthetic insulin analog was developed for clinical use at mealtime (prandial insulin), [[Humalog]] (insulin lispro),{{citation needed|reason=Humulin first introduced in 1982 per humulin.com, I don't have any peer-reviewed lit though|date=April 2015}} it is more rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous injection than regular insulin, with an effect 15&nbsp;minutes after injection. Other rapid-acting analogues are [[NovoRapid]] and [[Apidra]], with similar profiles. All are rapidly absorbed due to amino acid sequences that will reduce formation of dimers and hexamers (monomeric insulins are more rapidly absorbed). Fast acting insulins do not require the injection-to-meal interval previously recommended for human insulin and animal insulins. The other type is long acting insulin; the first of these was [[Lantus]] (insulin glargine). These have a steady effect for an extended period from 18 to 24&nbsp;hours. Likewise, another protracted insulin analogue ([[Levemir]]) is based on a fatty acid acylation approach. A myristyric acid molecule is attached to this analogue, which associates the insulin molecule to the abundant serum albumin, which in turn extends the effect and reduces the risk of hypoglycemia. Both protracted analogues need to be taken only once daily, and are used for type 1 diabetics as the basal insulin. A combination of a rapid acting and a protracted insulin is also available, making it more likely for patients to achieve an insulin profile that mimics that of the body´s own insulin release.

Insulin is usually taken as [[subcutaneous injection]]s by single-use [[syringe]]s with [[hypodermic needle|needle]]s, via an [[insulin pump]], or by repeated-use [[insulin pen]]s with disposable needles. [[Inhaled insulin]] is also available in the U.S. market now.

Synthetic insulin can trigger adverse effects, so some people with diabetes rely on animal-source insulin.<ref>http://www.iddt.org/diabetic-commonsense/the-great-debate-natural-animal-or-artificial-human-insulin</ref>

Unlike many medicines, insulin currently cannot be taken orally because, like nearly all other proteins introduced into the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]], it is reduced to fragments, whereupon all activity is lost. There has been some research into ways to protect insulin from the digestive tract, so that it can be administered orally or sublingually.<ref name="pmid27364922">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wong CY, Martinez J, Dass CR | title = Oral delivery of insulin for treatment of diabetes: status quo, challenges and opportunities | journal = The Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 1093–108 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27364922 | doi = 10.1111/jphp.12607 }}</ref><ref name="pmid27014614">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shah RB, Patel M, Maahs DM, Shah VN | title = Insulin delivery methods: Past, present and future | journal = International Journal of Pharmaceutical Investigation | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–9 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27014614 | pmc = 4787057 | doi = 10.4103/2230-973X.176456 }}</ref>

== Study History ==

=== Discovery ===
In 1869, while studying the structure of the [[pancreas]] under a [[microscope]], [[Paul Langerhans]], a medical student in [[Berlin]], identified some previously unnoticed tissue clumps scattered throughout the bulk of the pancreas. The function of the "little heaps of cells", later [[eponym|known as]] the ''[[islets of Langerhans]]'', initially remained unknown, but [[Edouard Laguesse]] later suggested they might produce secretions that play a regulatory role in digestion. Paul Langerhans' son, Archibald, also helped to understand this regulatory role. The term "insulin" originates from ''insula'', the Latin word for islet/island.

In 1889, the physician [[Oskar Minkowski]], in collaboration with [[Joseph von Mering]], removed the pancreas from a healthy dog to test its assumed role in digestion. On testing the urine, they found sugar, establishing for the first time a relationship between the pancreas and diabetes. In 1901, another major step was taken by the American physician and scientist [[Eugene Lindsay Opie]], when he established the link between the islets of Langerhans and diabetes: "Diabetes mellitus when the result of a lesion of the pancreas is caused by destruction of the islands of Langerhans and occurs only when these bodies are in part or wholly destroyed".<ref name="Johns Hopkins Hosp. Bull. p.264)">{{cite journal | vauthors = Opie EL | title = Diabetes Mellitus Associated with Hyaline Degeneration of the islands of Langerhans of the Pancreas | journal = Bulletin of the Johns Hopkins Hospital | volume = 12 | issue = 125 | pages = 263–264 | year = 1901 }}</ref><ref name="J.

Over the next two decades researchers made several attempts to isolate – as a potential treatment – whatever the islets produced. In 1906 [[George Ludwig Zuelzer]] achieved partial success in treating dogs with pancreatic extract, but he was unable to continue his work. Between 1911 and 1912, E.L. Scott at the [[University of Chicago]] used aqueous pancreatic extracts, and noted "a slight diminution of glycosuria", but was unable to convince his director of his work's value; it was shut down. [[Israel Kleiner (biochemist)|Israel Kleiner]] demonstrated similar effects at [[Rockefeller University]] in 1915, but [[World War I]] interrupted his work and he did not return to it.<ref name="J. Nutrition 92">{{cite journal | url = http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/reprint/92/4/507.pdf | author = The American Institute of Nutrition |title=Proceedings of the Thirty-first Annual Meeting of the American Institute of Nutrition | journal = Journal of Nutrition | volume = 92 | year = 1967 | page = 509 | format = PDF }}</ref>

In 1916, [[Nicolae Paulescu]], a [[Romanians|Romanian]] professor of physiology at the [[Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy|University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Bucharest]], developed an [[aqueous]] [[Pancreas|pancreatic]] extract which, when injected into a [[Diabetes|diabetic]] dog, had a normalizing effect on [[blood sugar|blood-sugar]] levels. He had to interrupt his experiments because of [[World War I]], and in 1921 he wrote four papers about his work carried out in [[Bucharest]] and his tests on a diabetic dog. Later that year, he published "Research on the Role of the [[Pancreas]] in Food Assimilation".<ref name="nrjs">{{Cite journal | author = Paulesco NC | journal = Archives Internationales de Physiologie | title= Recherche sur le rôle du pancréas dans l'assimilation nutritive|volume= 17|issue=|pages= 85–103| date=August 31, 1921 }}

=== Extraction and purification ===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2017}}<!--first 4 paragraphs hae no citations-->
In October 1920, Canadian [[Frederick Banting]] concluded that it was the very digestive secretions that Minkowski had originally studied that were breaking down the islet secretion(s), thereby making it impossible to extract successfully. He jotted a note to himself: "Ligate pancreatic ducts of the dog. Keep dogs alive till acini degenerate leaving islets. Try to isolate internal secretion of these and relieve glycosurea."

The idea was the pancreas's internal secretion, which, it was supposed, regulates sugar in the bloodstream, might hold the key to the treatment of diabetes. A surgeon by training, Banting knew certain arteries could be tied off that would lead to atrophy of most of the pancreas, while leaving the islets of Langerhans intact. He theorized a relatively pure extract could be made from the islets once most of the rest of the pancreas was gone.

In the spring of 1921, Banting traveled to [[Toronto]] to explain his idea to [[John James Rickard Macleod|J.J.R. Macleod]], Professor of Physiology at the [[University of Toronto]], and asked Macleod if he could use his lab space to test the idea. Initially skeptical, Macleod eventually agreed and supplied Banting with ten test animals (dogs) and two medical students, [[Charles Herbert Best|Charles Best]] and Clark Noble, as lab assistants. Since Banting required only one lab assistant, Best and Noble flipped a coin to see which would assist Banting for the first half of the summer. Best won the coin toss and took the first shift. This may have proved unfortunate for Noble, Banting decided to keep Best for the entire summer and eventually shared half his Nobel Prize money and a large part of the credit for the discovery.<ref name="pmid12473641">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wright JR | title = Almost famous: E. Clark Noble, the common thread in the discovery of insulin and vinblastine | journal = Cmaj | volume = 167 | issue = 12 | pages = 1391–6 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12473641 | pmc = 137361 | doi =  }}</ref> Banting's method was to tie a [[ligature (medicine)|ligature]] around the pancreatic duct; when examined several weeks later, the pancreatic digestive cells had died and been absorbed by the immune system, leaving thousands of islets. They then isolated an extract from these islets, producing what they called "isletin" (what we now know as insulin), and tested this extract on the dogs starting July 27.<ref name="Krishnamurthy2002">{{cite book | author = Krishnamurthy K | title = Pioneers in scientific discoveries | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dAXYzzDL_9oC&pg=PA266 | accessdate = 26 July 2011 | year = 2002 | publisher = Mittal Publications | isbn = 978-81-7099-844-0 | page=266 }}</ref> Banting and Best were then able to keep a pancreatectomized dog named Marjorie alive for the rest of the summer by injecting her with the crude extract they had prepared. Removal of the pancreas in test animals in essence mimics diabetes, leading to elevated blood glucose levels. Marjorie was able to remain alive because the extracts, containing isletin, were able to lower her blood glucose levels.

Banting and Best presented their results to Macleod on his return to Toronto in the fall of 1921, but Macleod pointed out flaws with the experimental design, and suggested the experiments be repeated with more dogs and better equipment. He then supplied Banting and Best with a better laboratory, and began paying Banting a salary from his research grants. Several weeks later, the second round of experiments was also a success; and Macleod helped publish their results privately in Toronto that November. However, six weeks required to extract the isletin forced considerable delays. Banting suggested they try to use fetal calf pancreas, which had not yet developed digestive glands; he was relieved to find this method worked well. With the supply problem solved, the next major effort was to purify the extract. In December 1921, Macleod invited the [[biochemist]] [[James Collip]] to help with this task, and, within a month, the team felt ready for a clinical test.

On January 11, 1922, [[Leonard Thompson (diabetic)|Leonard Thompson]], a 14-year-old diabetic who lay dying at the [[Toronto General Hospital]], was given the first injection of insulin.<ref name="pmid8409364">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bliss M | title = Rewriting medical history: Charles Best and the Banting and Best myth | journal = Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences | volume = 48 | issue = 3 | pages = 253–74 | date = July 1993 | pmid = 8409364 | doi = 10.1093/jhmas/48.3.253 }}</ref> However, the extract was so impure, Thompson suffered a severe [[anaphylaxis|allergic reaction]], and further injections were canceled. Over the next 12&nbsp;days, Collip worked day and night to improve the ox-pancreas extract, and a second dose was injected on January 23. This was completely successful, not only in having no obvious side-effects but also in completely eliminating the [[glycosuria]] sign of diabetes. The first American patient was [[Elizabeth Hughes Gossett]], the daughter of U.S. Secretary of State [[Charles Evans Hughes]].<ref name=miracle>{{cite news |author = Zuger A | title = Rediscovering the First Miracle Drug | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/05/health/05insulin.html?_r=1&hp=&pagewanted=all | quote = Elizabeth Hughes was a cheerful, pretty little girl, five feet tall, with straight brown hair and a consuming interest in birds.

Children dying from diabetic ketoacidosis were kept in large wards, often with 50 or more patients in a ward, mostly comatose. Grieving family members were often in attendance, awaiting the (until then, inevitable) death.

Banting and Best never worked well with Collip, regarding him as something of an interloper, and Collip left the project soon after.

Over the spring of 1922, Best managed to improve his techniques to the point where large quantities of insulin could be extracted on demand, but the preparation remained impure. The drug firm [[Eli Lilly and Company]] had offered assistance not long after the first publications in 1921, and they took Lilly up on the offer in April. In November, Lilly's head chemist, [[George B. Walden]] discovered [[Protein precipitation#Isoelectric precipitation|isoelectric precipitation]] and was able to produce large quantities of highly refined insulin. Insulin was offered for sale shortly thereafter.

=== Synthesis ===
Purified animal-sourced insulin was the only type of insulin available to diabetics until genetic advances occurred later with medical research. The amino acid structure of insulin was characterized in the early 1950s by [[Frederick Sanger#Sequencing insulin|Frederick Sanger]],<ref name="Stretton_2002"/> and the first synthetic insulin was produced simultaneously in the labs of [[Panayotis Katsoyannis]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and [[Helmut Zahn]] at [[RWTH Aachen University]] in the early 1960s.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Costin GE | title = What is the advantage of having melanin in parts of the central nervous system (e.g. substantia nigra)? | journal = IUBMB Life | volume = 56 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–9 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14992380 | doi = 10.1080/15216540310001659029 | publisher = Time Inc. }}</ref><ref name="isbn1-4020-0655-1">{{cite book |vauthors=Wollmer A, Dieken ML, Federwisch M, De Meyts P | title = Insulin & related proteins structure to function and pharmacology | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers | location = Boston | year = 2002 | pages = | isbn = 1-4020-0655-1 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Ula72_FSwy8C&lpg=PP11&dq=Panayotis%20Katsoyannis&pg=PP11#v=onepage&q=Panayotis%20Katsoyannis }}</ref>

The first genetically engineered, synthetic "human" insulin was produced using [[Escherichia coli|''E. coli'']] in 1978 by [[Arthur Riggs (geneticist)|Arthur Riggs]] and [[Keiichi Itakura]] at the [[Beckman Research Institute]] of the [[City of Hope National Medical Center|City of Hope]] in collaboration with [[Herbert Boyer]] at [[Genentech]].<ref name="urlGenentech" /><ref name="urlRecombinant DNA technology in the synthesis of human insulin" /> Genentech, founded by Swanson, Boyer and [[Eli Lilly and Company]], went on in 1982 to sell the first commercially available biosynthetic human insulin under the brand name [[Humulin]].<ref name="urlRecombinant DNA technology in the synthesis of human insulin"/> The vast majority of insulin currently used worldwide is now biosynthetic recombinant "human" insulin or its analogues.<ref name="pmid23222785" />

Recombinant insulin is produced either in yeast (usually ''[[baker's yeast|Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'') or ''E. coli''.<ref name="pmid11030562">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kjeldsen T | title = Yeast secretory expression of insulin precursors | journal = Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology | volume = 54 | issue = 3 | pages = 277–86 | date = September 2000 | pmid = 11030562 | doi = 10.1007/s002530000402 }}</ref> In yeast, insulin may be engineered as a single-chain protein with a KexII endoprotease (a yeast homolog of PCI/PCII) site that separates the insulin A chain from a c-terminally truncated insulin B chain.  A chemically synthesized c-terminal tail is then grafted onto insulin by reverse proteolysis using the inexpensive protease trypsin; typically the lysine on the c-terminal tail is protected with a chemical protecting group to prevent proteolysis.  The ease of modular synthesis and the relative safety of modifications in that region accounts for common insulin analogs with c-terminal modifications (e.g. lispro, aspart, glulisine).  The Genentech synthesis and completely chemical synthesis such as that by [[Bruce Merrifield]] are not preferred because the efficiency of recombining the two insulin chains is low, primarily due to competition with the precipitation of insulin B chain.

=== Nobel Prizes ===
[[File:C. H. Best and F. G. Banting ca. 1924.png|thumb|Frederick Banting joined by [[Charles Herbert Best|Charles Best]] in office, 1924]] 
The [[Nobel Prize]] committee in 1923 credited the practical extraction of insulin to a team at the [[University of Toronto]] and awarded the Nobel Prize to two men: [[Frederick Banting]] and [[John James Rickard Macleod|J.J.R. Macleod]].<ref name="urlThe Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1923">{{cite web | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1923/ | title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1923 | publisher = The Nobel Foundation }}</ref> They were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1923 for the discovery of insulin. Banting, insulted that Best was not mentioned, shared his prize with him, and Macleod immediately shared his with [[James Collip]]. The patent for insulin was sold to the [[University of Toronto]] for one half-dollar.

The [[primary structure]] of insulin was determined by British molecular biologist [[Frederick Sanger]].<ref name="Stretton_2002">{{cite journal | vauthors = Stretton AO | title = The first sequence. Fred Sanger and insulin | journal = Genetics | volume = 162 | issue = 2 | pages = 527–32 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12399368 | pmc = 1462286 | doi =  }}</ref> It was the first protein to have its sequence be determined. He was awarded the 1958 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for this work.

In 1969, after decades of work, [[Dorothy Hodgkin]] determined the spatial conformation of the molecule, the so-called [[tertiary structure]], by means of [[X-ray diffraction]] studies. She had been awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964 for the development of [[crystallography]].

[[Rosalyn Sussman Yalow]] received the 1977 Nobel Prize in Medicine for the development of the [[radioimmunoassay]] for insulin.

[[George Minot]], co-recipient of the 1934 Nobel Prize for the development of the first effective treatment for [[pernicious anemia]], had [[diabetes mellitus]].  Dr. [[William Bosworth Castle|William Castle]] observed that the 1921 discovery of insulin, arriving in time to keep Minot alive, was therefore also responsible for the discovery of a cure for [[pernicious anemia]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Castle WB | title = The Gordon Wilson Lecture.

=== Nobel Prize controversy ===
[[Image:Nicolae Paulescu - Foto03.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Nicolae Paulescu]]]]

Professor Ian Murray was particularly active in working to correct "the historical wrong" against [[Nicolae Paulescu]]. Murray was a professor of physiology at the Anderson College of Medicine in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], the head of the department of Metabolic Diseases at a leading Glasgow hospital, vice-president of the British Association of Diabetes, and a founding member of the [[International Diabetes Federation]]. Murray wrote:

<blockquote>Insufficient recognition has been given to Paulescu, the distinguished [[Romania]]n scientist, who at the time when the Toronto team were commencing their research had already succeeded in extracting the antidiabetic hormone of the pancreas and proving its efficacy in reducing the hyperglycaemia in diabetic dogs.<ref name="pmid4560502">{{cite journal | vauthors = Drury MI | title = The golden jubile of insulin | journal = Journal of the Irish Medical Association | volume = 65 | issue = 14 | pages = 355–63 | date = July 1972 | pmid = 4560502 | doi =  }}</ref>
