'''Fenproporex''' ('''Perphoxene''') is a [[stimulant]] [[drug]] of the [[substituted phenethylamine|phenethylamine]] and [[substituted amphetamine|amphetamine]] [[chemical class]]es which was developed in the 1960s. It is used as an [[appetite suppressant]] for the treatment of [[obesity]].<ref>Warembourg H, Jaillard J. Clinical experimentation with fenproporex in the treatment of obesity. Apropos of 40 cases. (French). ''Journal de la Faculte de m√©decine et de pharmacie de l'Universite de Lille''. 1968 Mar;13(3):Suppl:273-6.</ref>

Fenproporex produces [[amphetamine]] as a [[metabolite]],<ref>Tognoni G, Morselli PL, Garattini S. Amphetamine concentrations in rat brain and human urine after fenproporex administration. ''European Journal of Pharmacology''. 1972 Oct;20(1):125-6.</ref><ref>Cody JT. Metabolic precursors to amphetamine and methamphetamine. ''Forensic Science Reviews'' 1993; 5:109.</ref> and was withdrawn in many countries following problems with [[drug abuse|abuse]],<ref>Pelissier-Alicot AL, Piercecchi-Marti MD, Bartoli C, Kuhlmann E, Coiffait PE, Sanvoisin A, Giocanti D, Leonetti G. Abusive prescription of psychostimulants: a study of two cases. ''Journal of Forensic Science''. 2006 Mar;51(2):407-10.</ref> but it is still prescribed in some countries.  It is sometimes combined with [[benzodiazepines]], [[antidepressants]] and other compounds to create the "Brazilian diet pill".<ref>Cohen PA. Imported fenproporex-based diet pills from Brazil: a report of two cases.  Journal of General Internal Medicine 2009; 24(3):430-3.</ref><ref>Cohen PA, McCormick D, Casey C, Dawson G, Hacker KA. Imported compounded diet pill use among Brazilian women immigrants in the United States. Journal of Immigrant and Minority Health 2009; 11(3):229-236.</ref>

Fenproporex has never been approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|US Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for sale in the US due to lack of efficacy and safety data.  However, in March 2009 the FDA warned consumers that it has been detected as an unlabeled component of diet pills available over the Internet.<ref>http://www.fda.gov/cder/consumerinfo/weight_loss_products.htm</ref> Fenproporex is designated a Schedule IV [[controlled substance]] in the US pursuant to the [[Controlled Substances Act]].<ref name="21CFR1308.14e4">{{cite web
