'''Thiomersal''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]), or '''thimerosal''' ([[United States Pharmacopeia|USP]]), is an [[organomercury]] compound. This compound is a well established [[antiseptic]] and [[antifungal agent]].

The pharmaceutical corporation [[Eli Lilly and Company]] gave thiomersal the trade name '''Merthiolate'''. It has been used as a [[preservative]] in [[vaccine]]s, [[immunoglobulin]] preparations, [[Allergy#Diagnosis|skin test antigens]], [[antivenin]]s, [[ophthalmology|ophthalmic]] and nasal products, and [[tattoo]] inks.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Sharpe | first1 = M.

== History ==
[[Morris Kharasch]], a [[chemist]] at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], filed a patent application for thiomersal in 1927;<ref>{{US patent|1672615}} "Alkyl mercuric sulphur compound and process of producing it".</ref> Eli Lilly later marketed the compound under the trade name Merthiolate.<ref name="Baker"/> [[In vitro]] tests conducted by Lilly investigators H. M. Powell and W. A. Jamieson found that it was forty to fifty times as effective as [[phenol]] against ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''.<ref name="Baker"/> It was used to kill bacteria and prevent contamination in antiseptic ointments, creams, jellies, and sprays used by consumers and in hospitals, including nasal sprays, eye drops, contact lens solutions, [[immunoglobulin]]s, and vaccines. Thiomersal was used as a preservative ([[bactericide]]) so that multidose vials of vaccines could be used instead of single-dose vials, which are more expensive. By 1938, Lilly's assistant director of research listed thiomersal as one of the five most important drugs ever developed by the company.<ref name="Baker"/>

== Structure ==
Thiomersal features [[Mercury (element)|mercury]](II) with a coordination number 2, ''i.e.'' two [[ligands]] are attached to Hg, the [[thiolate]] and the ethyl group.  The [[carboxylate]] group confers solubility in water.  Like other two-coordinate Hg(II) compounds, the coordination geometry of Hg is linear, with a 180° S-Hg-C angle.  Typically, organomercury thiolate compounds are prepared from organomercury chlorides.<ref name="molstruct">{{ cite journal | first1 = J.

== Use ==
Thiomersal's main use is as an antiseptic and antifungal agent, due to the [[oligodynamic effect]]. In multidose injectable drug delivery systems, it prevents serious adverse effects such as the ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' infection that, in one 1928 incident, killed 12 of 21 children [[vaccinate]]d with a [[diphtheria]] vaccine that lacked a preservative.<ref name=T-in-vaccines/> Unlike other vaccine preservatives used at the time, thiomersal does not reduce the potency of the vaccines that it protects.<ref name=Baker>{{cite journal |journal= Am J Public Health |year=2008 |title= Mercury, Vaccines, and Autism: One Controversy, Three Histories |author= Baker JP |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2007.113159 |pmid=18172138 |volume=98 |issue=2 |pages=244–53 |pmc= 2376879}}</ref> [[Bacteriostatic]]s such as thiomersal are not needed in single-dose injectables.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/cber/vaccine/thimfaq.htm | title = Thimerosal in Vaccines: Frequently Asked Questions | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] | accessdate = 2008-03-09 }}</ref>

== Toxicology ==
Thiomersal is very toxic by inhalation, ingestion, and in contact with skin (EC [[hazard symbol]] T+), with a danger of cumulative effects. It is also very toxic to aquatic organisms and may cause long-term adverse effects in aquatic environments (EC hazard symbol N).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merck-chemicals.com/documents/sds/emd/int/en/8170/817043.pdf |format=PDF |date=2005-06-12 |accessdate=2010-01-01 |publisher=Merck |title=Safety data sheet, Thiomersal Ph Eur, BP, USP }}</ref> In the body, it is metabolized or degraded to [[ethylmercury]] (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>Hg<sup>+</sup>) and [[thiosalicylate]].<ref name=T-in-vaccines/>

Cases have been reported of severe [[mercury poisoning]] by accidental exposure or attempted suicide, with some fatalities.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Environ Health Perspect |year=2002 |volume=110 |issue=S1 |pages=11–23 |title=The three modern faces of mercury |author=Clarkson TW |pmid=11834460 |pmc=1241144 |url=http://www.ehponline.org/members/2002/suppl-1/11-23clarkson/clarkson-full.html |doi=10.1289/ehp.02110s111 }}</ref> Animal experiments suggest that thiomersal rapidly dissociates to release ethylmercury after injection; that the disposition patterns of mercury are similar to those after exposure to equivalent doses of ethylmercury chloride; and that the central nervous system and the kidneys are targets, with lack of motor coordination being a common sign. Similar signs and symptoms have been observed in accidental human [[Mercury poisoning|poisonings]]. The mechanisms of toxic action are unknown. Fecal excretion accounts for most of the elimination from the body. Ethylmercury clears from blood with a [[half-life]] of about 18 days in adults by breakdown into other chemicals, including inorganic mercury. Ethylmercury is eliminated from the brain in about 14 days in infant monkeys. Risk assessment for effects on the nervous system have been made by extrapolating from dose-response relationships for [[methylmercury]].<ref name=Clarkson/> Methylmercury and ethylmercury distribute to all body tissues, crossing the [[blood–brain barrier]] and the [[placental barrier]], and ethylmercury also moves freely throughout the body.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Clarkson TW, Vyas JB, Ballatori N |title=Mechanisms of mercury disposition in the body |journal= Am J Ind Med |volume=50 |issue=10 |pages=757–64 |year=2007 |pmid=17477364 |doi=10.1002/ajim.20476 }}</ref> Concerns based on extrapolations from methylmercury caused thiomersal to be removed from U.S. childhood vaccines, starting in 1999. Since then, it has been found that ethylmercury is eliminated from the body and the brain significantly faster than methylmercury, so the late-1990s risk assessments turned out to be overly conservative.<ref name=Clarkson/>  Though inorganic mercury metabolized from ethylmercury has a much longer half-life in the brain, at least 120 days, it appears to be much less [[Mercury poisoning#Mechanism|toxic]] than the inorganic mercury produced from mercury vapor, for reasons not yet understood.<ref name=Clarkson>{{cite journal |journal=Crit Rev Toxicol |year=2006 |volume=36 |issue=8 |pages=609–62 |title=The toxicology of mercury and its chemical compounds |vauthors=Clarkson TW, Magos L |doi=10.1080/10408440600845619 |pmid=16973445 }}</ref>
