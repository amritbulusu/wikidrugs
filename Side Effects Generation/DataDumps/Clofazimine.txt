==Medical uses==
The primary use of clofazimine is for the treatment of leprosy.<ref name=AHFS2016/> Other uses have not been proven to be safe or effective.<ref name=AHFS2016/>

It has been used studied in combination with other antimycobacterial drugs to treat ''[[Mycobacterium avium]]'' infections in people with [[HIV/AIDS]] and ''[[Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis]]''. Clofazimine also has a marked anti-inflammatory effect and is given to control the leprosy reaction, [[erythema]] nodosum leprosum (ENL). (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1993, p1619). The drug is given as an alternative to people who can not tolerate the effects of [[dapsone]] for leprosy.<ref name="ReferenceA">Clinical Microbiology Made Ridiculously Simple</ref>

==Side effects==
Clofazimine produces pink to brownish skin pigmentation in 75-100% of patients within a few weeks, as well as similar discoloration of most bodily fluids and secretions. These discolorations are reversible but may take months to years to disappear. There is evidence in medical literature that as a result of clofazimine administration, several patients have developed [[Depression (mood)|depression]] which in some cases resulted in suicide. It has been hypothesized that the depression was a result of this chronic skin discoloration.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brown, Stoudemire|title=Psychiatric Side Effects of Prescription and Over-the-counter Medications: Recognition and Management|date=1998|publisher=American Psychiatric Pub|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=K7kevbILCuQC&pg=RA2-PA1985&dq=clofazimine+suicide&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=clofazimine%20suicide&f=false|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305024758/https://books.google.ca/books?id=K7kevbILCuQC&pg=RA2-PA1985&dq=clofazimine+suicide&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=clofazimine%20suicide&f=false|archivedate=2016-03-05|df=}}</ref>

Cases of [[icthyosis]] and skin dryness are also reported in response to this drug (8%-28%), as well as rash and itchiness (1-5%).

40-50% of patients develop gastrointestinal intolerance. Rarely, patients have died from bowel obstructions and intestinal bleeding, or required abdominal surgery to correct the same problem.

==Mechanism==
Clofazimine works by binding to the guanine bases of bacterial DNA, thereby blocking the template function of the DNA and inhibiting bacterial proliferation.<ref name="Arbiser">{{cite journal |vauthors=Arbiser JL, Moschella SL |date=Feb 1995 | title = Clofazimine: a review of its medical uses and mechanisms of action | url = | journal = J Am Acad Dermatol | volume = 32 | issue = 2  Pt 1 | pages = 241–7 | doi=10.1016/0190-9622(95)90134-5 | pmid=7829710}}</ref><ref name="Morrison">{{cite journal |author1=Morrison N.

Clofazimine is also a [[FIASMA]] (functional inhibitor of [[Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase|acid sphingomyelinase]]).<ref name="pmid18504571">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kornhuber J, Muehlbacher M, Trapp S, Pechmann S, Friedl A, Reichel M, Mühle C, Terfloth L, Groemer T, Spitzer G, Liedl K, Gulbins E, Tripal P |title=Identification of novel functional inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=6|issue=8|pages=e23852|year=2011|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0023852|pmid=21909365|pmc=3166082}}</ref>

Clofazimine has a biological half life of about 70 days.

==History==
Clofazimine, initially known as B663, was first synthesised in 1954 by a team of scientists at [[Trinity College, Dublin]]: [[Frank Winder]], J.G. Belton, Stanley McElhinney, M.L. Conalty, Seán O'Sullivan, and Dermot Twomey, led by [[Vincent Barry]]. Clofazimine was originally intended as an anti-tuberculosis drug but drug proved ineffective. In 1959, a researcher named Y. T. Chang identified its effectiveness against leprosy. After clinical trials in Nigeria and elsewhere during the 1960s, Swiss pharmaceutical company [[Novartis]] launched the product in 1969 under the brand name Lamprene.

Novartis was granted FDA approval of clofazimine in December 1986 as an [[orphan drug]]. The drug is currently no longer available in the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://reference.medscape.com/drug/clofazimine-342661 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709002738/http://reference.medscape.com/drug/clofazimine-342661 |archivedate=2014-07-09 |df= }}</ref>

==Society and culture==
Clofazimine is marketed under the trade name Lamprene by [[Novartis]]. One of the world's only producers of the clofazimine molecule is Sangrose Laboratories, located in [[Mavelikara]], [[India]].

==Research==
The immunosuppressive effects of clofazimine were immediately noticed when applied in animal model. Macrophages were first reported to be inhibited due to the stabilization of lysosomal membrane by clofazimine.<ref name="pmid4948088">{{cite journal |vauthors=Conalty ML, Barry VC, Jina A |title=The antileprosy agent B.663 (Clofazimine) and the reticuloendothelial system. |journal=Int J Lepr Other Mycobact Dis. |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=479–92 |date=Apr 1971 |pmid=4948088 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Clofazimine also showed a dosage-dependent inhibition of neutrophil motility, lymphocyte transformation,<ref name="pmid7098757">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gatner EM, Anderson R, van Remsburg CE, Imkamp FM |title=The in vitro and in vivo effects of clofazimine on the motility of neutrophils and transformation of lymphocytes from normal individuals. |journal=Lepr Rev. |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=85–90 |date=Jun 1982 |pmid=7098757 |doi= |url=}}</ref> mitogen-induced [[PBMC]] proliferation<ref name="pmid7049077">{{cite journal |vauthors=van Rensburg CE, Gatner EM, Imkamp FM, Anderson R |title=Effects of clofazimine alone or combined with dapsone on neutrophil and lymphocyte functions in normal individuals and patients with lepromatous leprosy. |journal=Antimicrob Agents Chemother. |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=693–7 |date=May 1982 |pmid=7049077 |doi= 10.1128/aac.21.5.693|url= |pmc=181995}}</ref> and complement-mediated solubilization of pre-formed immune complexes in vitro.<ref name="pmid1624226">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kashyap A, Sehgal VN, Sahu A, Saha K |title=Anti-leprosy drugs inhibit the complement-mediated solubilization of pre-formed immune complexes in vitro. |journal=Int J Immunopharmacol. |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=269–73 |date=Feb 1992 |pmid=1624226 |doi= 10.1016/0192-0561(92)90039-N|url=}}</ref> A mechanistic studying of clofazimine in human [[T cells]] revealed that this drug is a Kv1.3 ([[KCNA3]]) channel blocker.<ref name="pmid19104661">{{cite journal |author=Ren YR, Pan F, Parvez S, Fleig A, Chong CR, Xu J, Dang Y, Zhang J, Jiang H, Penner R, Liu JO. |editor1-last=Alberola-Ila |editor1-first=Jose |title=Clofazimine inhibits human Kv1.3 potassium channel by perturbing calcium oscillation in T lymphocytes. |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=3 |issue=12 |pages=e4009 |date=Dec 2008 |pmid=19104661 |doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0004009|url= |pmc=2602975}}</ref> This indicates that clofazimine will be potentially used for treatment of [[multiple sclerosis]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[type 1 diabetes]].
