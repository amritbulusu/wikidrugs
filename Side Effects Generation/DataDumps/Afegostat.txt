'''Afegostat''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]; also known as '''isofagomine'''; planned trade name '''Plicera''') was an experimental drug for the treatment of certain forms of [[Gaucher's disease]] that was being developed by [[Amicus Therapeutics]] and [[Shire plc]] until a failed clinical trial in 2009 led to termination of its development. The substance was used in form of the [[tartrate]].

==Mechanism of action==
[[β-Glucocerebrosidase]], an enzyme needed for the metabolisation of [[glucocerebroside]], is misfolded in individuals with Gaucher's disease due to various mutations, one of which is called N370S. Afegostat, an [[iminosugar]], binds selectively to N370S glucocerebrosidase and restores its correct [[Protein structure|conformation]] and, consequently, enhances its activity about threefold.<ref>{{cite journal

==Invention and development==

Afegostat was invented by [[Mikael Bols]] and Troels Skrydstrup and was first prepared by Jespersen and Bols.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jespersen|first1=T.

Amicus Therapeutics licensed patents related to afegostat from Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, University of Maryland, and Novo Nordisk A/S. They also signed a collaboration agreement with [[Shire plc]] related to this drug and others.<ref name=AmiocusAR2010>Amicus [http://ir.amicustherapeutics.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=950123-10-23137&CIK=1178879 Amicus 10-K Annual Report Filed Mar 10, 2010]</ref>{{rp|13}}  

It was granted [[orphan drug]] status by the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA)<ref>[http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/comp/opinion/48831507en.pdf Public summary of positive opinion for orphan designation of isofagomine tartrate for the treatment of Gaucher disease] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718151103/http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/comp/opinion/48831507en.pdf |date=July 18, 2009 }}</ref> and by the [[US FDA]].<ref name=AmiocusAR2010/>{{rp|10}}

When afegostat failed a Phase II clinical trial in 2009, Shire terminated the collaboration agreement and Amicus determined it would no longer develop the afegostat.<ref name=AmiocusAR2010/>{{rp|2,10,11}}  The first patents in Amicus' patent portfolio on afegostat expire in 2015.<ref name=AmiocusAR2010/>{{rp|12}}
