==Medical uses==
Fluconazole is a first-generation [[triazole]] antifungal medication.  It differs from earlier [[azole antifungals]] (such as [[ketoconazole]]) in that its structure contains a triazole ring instead of an [[imidazole]] ring.  While the imidazole antifungals are mainly used topically, fluconazole and certain other triazole antifungals are preferred when systemic treatment is required because of their improved safety and predictable absorption when administered orally.<ref name="US Pharmacist">{{cite web |url=http://www.uspharmacist.com/content/d/feature/c/22034/ |title=US Pharmacist |accessdate=2015-01-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210053347/http://www.uspharmacist.com/content/d/feature/c/22034/ |archivedate=2015-02-10 |df= }}</ref>

===Resistance===
Fungal resistance to drugs in the [[azole]] class tends to occur gradually over the course of prolonged drug therapy, resulting in clinical failure in immunocompromised patients (e.g., patients with advanced [[HIV]] receiving treatment for [[candidiasis|thrush]] or esophageal ''Candida'' infection).<ref name=Bennett>{{Cite book | author = Bennett J.

In ''[[Candida albicans|C. albicans]]'', resistance occurs by way of mutations in the ''ERG11'' gene, which codes for [[14α-demethylase]]. These mutations prevent the azole drug from binding, while still allowing binding of the enzyme's natural substrate, [[lanosterol]]. Development of resistance to one azole in this way will confer resistance to all drugs in the class. Another resistance mechanism employed by both ''C. albicans'' and ''C. glabrata'' is increasing the rate of efflux of the azole drug from the cell, by both [[ATP-binding cassette]] and major facilitator superfamily transporters. Other gene mutations are also known to contribute to development of resistance.<ref name=Bennett/> ''C. glabrata'' develops resistance by up regulating CDR genes, and resistance in ''C. krusei'' is mediated by reduced sensitivity of the target enzyme to inhibition by the agent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=575 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023123/http://labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=575 |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}</ref>

Fluconazole therapy has been associated with [[QT interval]] prolongation, which may lead to serious [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s. Thus, it is used with caution in patients with risk factors for prolonged QT interval, such as electrolyte imbalance or use of other drugs that may prolong the QT interval (particularly [[cisapride]] and [[pimozide]]).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Fluconazole taken at low doses is in FDA pregnancy category C. However, high doses have been associated with a rare and distinct set of birth defects in infants. If taken at these doses, the pregnancy category is changed from category C to category D. Pregnancy category D means there is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on human data. In some cases, the potential benefits from use of the drug in pregnant women with serious or life-threatening conditions may be acceptable despite its risks.

===Drug interactions===
Fluconazole is an inhibitor of the human [[cytochrome P450]] system, particularly the isozyme [[CYP2C19]] ([[CYP3A4]] and [[CYP2C9]] to lesser extent) <ref name="online.lexi.com">{{cite web |url=http://online.lexi.com/lco/action/doc/retrieve/docid/patch_f/6918 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221232723/http://online.lexi.com/lco/action/doc/retrieve/docid/patch_f/6918 |archivedate=2016-12-21 |df= }}</ref> In theory, therefore, fluconazole decreases the metabolism and increases the concentration of any drug metabolised by these enzymes. In addition, its potential effect on [[QT interval]] increases the risk of [[cardiac arrhythmia]] if used concurrently with other drugs that prolong the QT interval. [[Berberine]] has been shown to exert synergistic effects with fluconazole even in drug-resistant ''Candida albicans'' infections.<ref name="XuWang2009">{{cite journal|last1=Xu|first1=Yi|last2=Wang|first2=Yan|last3=Yan|first3=Lan|last4=Liang|first4=Rong-Mei|last5=Dai|first5=Bao-Di|last6=Tang|first6=Ren-Jie|last7=Gao|first7=Ping-Hui|last8=Jiang|first8=Yuan-Ying|title=Proteomic Analysis Reveals a Synergistic Mechanism of Fluconazole and Berberine against Fluconazole-ResistantCandida albicans: Endogenous ROS Augmentation|journal=Journal of Proteome Research|volume=8|issue=11|year=2009|pages=5296–5304|issn=1535-3893|doi=10.1021/pr9005074|pmid=19754040}}</ref> Fluconazole may decrease the metabolism of benzodiazepines.

==Mechanism of action==
Like other [[imidazole]]- and [[triazole]]-class antifungals, fluconazole inhibits the fungal [[cytochrome P450]] enzyme [[14α-demethylase]]. Mammalian demethylase activity is much less sensitive to fluconazole than fungal demethylase. This inhibition prevents the conversion of [[lanosterol]] to [[ergosterol]], an essential component of the fungal [[cytoplasmic membrane]], and subsequent accumulation of 14α-methyl sterols.<ref name="DiflucanPI">Pfizer Australia Pty Ltd. Diflucan (Australian Approved Product Information). West Ryde (NSW): Pfizer Australia; 2004.</ref> Fluconazole is primarily fungistatic; however, it may be [[fungicidal]] against certain organisms in a dose-dependent manner, specifically ''Cryptococcus''.<ref name="LongleyMuzoora2008">{{cite journal|last1=Longley|first1=Nicky|last2=Muzoora|first2=Conrad|last3=Taseera|first3=Kabanda|last4=Mwesigye|first4=James|last5=Rwebembera|first5=Joselyne|last6=Chakera|first6=Ali|last7=Wall|first7=Emma|last8=Andia|first8=Irene|last9=Jaffar|first9=Shabbar|title=Dose Response Effect of High‐Dose Fluconazole for HIV‐Associated Cryptococcal Meningitis in Southwestern Uganda|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|volume=47|issue=12|year=2008|pages=1556–1561|issn=1058-4838|doi=10.1086/593194|pmid=18990067|last10=Harrison|first10=Thomas S.}}</ref>

It is interesting to note, when fluconazole was in development at Pfizer, it was decided early in the process to avoid producing any [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] centers in the drug so subsequent synthesis and purification would not encounter difficulties with [[enantiomer]] separation and associated variations in biological effect.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} A number of related compounds were found to be extremely potent [[teratogens]], and were subsequently discarded.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==Pharmacokinetics==
Following oral dosing, fluconazole is almost completely absorbed within two hours.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} [[Bioavailability]] is not significantly affected by the absence of stomach acid. Concentrations measured in the urine, tears, and skin are approximately 10 times the plasma concentration, whereas saliva, sputum, and vaginal fluid concentrations are approximately equal to the plasma concentration, following a standard dose range of between 100&nbsp;mg and 400&nbsp;mg per day.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The [[elimination half-life]] of fluconazole follows zero order kinetics, and only 10% of elimination is due to [[metabolism]], the remainder being excreted in urine and sweat. Patients with impaired renal function will be at risk of overdose.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
