'''Meloxicam''' is a [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] (NSAID) with [[analgesic]] and [[anti-pyretic|fever reducer]] effects. It is an [[oxicam]] closely related to [[piroxicam]], and falls in the [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug#Enolic_acid_.28Oxicam.29_derivatives|enolic acid]] group of NSAIDs.<ref name=drugs.com>{{cite web

==Side effects==
Meloxicam use can result in [[human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] toxicity and bleeding, headaches, rash, and [[melena|very dark or black stool]] (a sign of intestinal bleeding). Like other [[NSAID]]s, its use is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events such as [[heart attack]] and [[stroke]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Stamm O, Latscha U, Janecek P, et al |title=Development of a special electrode for continuous subcutaneous pH measurement in the infant scalp |journal=Am.

===Cardiovascular side effects===
Persons with hypertension, high cholesterol, or diabetes are at risk for cardiovascular side effects. Persons with family history of heart disease, heart attack, or stroke must tell their treating physician as the potential for serious cardiovascular side effects is significant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a601242.html|title=Medline Plus|publisher=Nlm.nih.gov|accessdate=15 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drugs.com/meloxicam.html|title=Drugs.com|publisher=Drugs.com|accessdate=15 November 2014}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
{{Main|Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug}}
Meloxicam blocks [[cyclooxygenase]] (COX), the [[enzyme]] responsible for converting [[arachidonic acid]] into [[prostaglandin H2|prostaglandin H<sub>2</sub>]]—the first step in the synthesis of [[prostaglandin]]s, which are mediators of inflammation.
Meloxicam has been shown, especially at its low therapeutic doses, selectively to inhibit [[COX-2]] over [[COX-1]].<ref name=drugs1996/>

Meloxicam concentrations in [[synovial fluid]] range from 40% to 50% of those in [[blood plasma|plasma]]. The free fraction in synovial fluid is 2.5 times higher than in plasma, due to the lower albumin content in synovial fluid as compared to plasma. The significance of this penetration is unknown,<ref name=drugs.com/> but it may account for the fact that it performs exceptionally well in treatment of arthritis in animal models.<ref>{{cite journal

|pmid= 8564518}}</ref>

==Veterinary use==
Meloxicam is used in [[veterinary medicine]], most commonly in dogs and cats, but also sees [[off-label use]] in other animals such as cattle and exotics.<ref>Off-label use discussed in: Arnold Plotnick MS, DVM, ACVIM, ABVP, [http://www.manhattancats.com/Articles/pain.html Pain Management using Metacam], and Stein, Robert, [http://www.vasg.org/perioperative_pain_management_part_iv.htm Perioperative Pain Management] Part IV, Looking Beyond Butorphanol, Sep 2006, Veterinary Anesthesia & Analgesia Support Group.</ref><ref>For off-label use example in rabbits, see Krempels, Dana, [http://www.bio.miami.edu/hare/paresis.html Hind Limb Paresis and Paralysis in Rabbits], University of Miami Biology Department.</ref> 

Side effects in animals are similar to those found in humans; the principal side effect is gastrointestinal irritation (vomiting, diarrhea, and [[peptic ulcer|ulceration]]). Rarer but important side effects include liver and kidney toxicity.

A peer-reviewed journal article cites feline overdose of NSAIDs, including meloxicam, as being a cause of severe kidney damage in cats.<ref>Merola, Valentina, DVM, DABT, and Dunayer Eric, MS, VMD, DABT, [http://www.aspcapro.org/mydocuments/zl-vetm0606_339-342.pdf The 10 most common toxicoses in cats], Toxicology Brief, Veterinary Medicine, pp. 340–342, June, 2006.</ref>

Meloxicam has been investigated as an alternative to [[Diclofenac]] by the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds|RSPB]] to prevent deaths of [[vulture]]s.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

===Pharmacokinetics===
In dogs, the [[Absorption (pharmacokinetics)|absorption]] of meloxicam from the stomach is not affected by the presence of food,<ref name="Khan 2012">{{cite journal|last1=Khan|first1=SA|last2=McLean|first2=MK|title=Toxicology of frequently encountered nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in dogs and cats|journal=The Veterinary clinics of North America. Small animal practice|date=March 2012|volume=42|issue=2|pages=289-306, vi-vii|doi=10.1016/j.cvsm.2012.01.003|pmid=22381180}}</ref> with the peak concentration ([[Cmax (pharmacology)|C<sub>max</sub>]]) of meloxicam occurring in the blood 7–8 hours after administration.<ref name="Khan 2012" /> The [[Biological half-life|half-life]] of meloxicam is approximately 24 hours in dogs.<ref name="Khan 2012"/>

In the [[koala]] (''Phascolarctos cinereus''), very little meloxicam is absorbed into the blood after [[oral administration]] (that is, it has poor [[bioavailability]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kimble|first1=B.|last2=Black|first2=L.

===Legal status===
====United States====
Since 2003, meloxicam has been approved in the U.S. for use in dogs for the management of pain and inflammation associated with [[osteoarthritis]], as an [[dosage forms#Oral|oral]] ([[suspension (chemistry)|liquid]]) formulation of meloxicam.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/Products/ApprovedAnimalDrugProducts/FOIADrugSummaries/ucm118006.pdf|title=NADA 141-213: New Animal Drug Application Approval (for Metacam (meloxicam) 0.5 mg/mL and 1.5 mg/mL Oral Suspension)|date=April 15, 2003|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=24 July 2010}}</ref> In January 2005, the product insert added a warning in bold-face type: "Do not use in cats."<ref name="ProdInsert">Metacam [http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/Products/ApprovedAnimalDrugProducts/DrugLabels/UCM050394.pdf Client Information Sheet], product description: "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for oral use in dogs only", and in the "What Is Metacam" section in bold-face type: "Do not use in cats.", January 2005.</ref> An [[injectable]] formulation for use in dogs was approved by the FDA in November 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/Products/ApprovedAnimalDrugProducts/FOIADrugSummaries/ucm118026.pdf |format=PDF|title=Metacam 5 mg/mL Solution for Injection|publisher=Fda.gov|accessdate=15 November 2014}}</ref> 

In October 2004, a formulation for use in cats was approved for use prior to surgery only.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/Products/ApprovedAnimalDrugProducts/FOIADrugSummaries/ucm118027.pdf|format=PDF|title=Metacam 5 mg/mL Solution for Injection, Supplemental Approval|date=October 28, 2004|publisher=Fda.gov|accessdate=15 November 2014}}</ref> This is an injectable meloxicam, indicated for as a single, one-time dose only, with specific and repeated warnings not to administer a second dose.<ref>See the manufacturer's [http://www.metacam.com/index.php/FAQs-Veterinary-Professionals FAQ] on its website, and its [http://www.bi-vetmedica.com/product_sites/METACAMINCats/documents/Metacam_Inj_cats_label.pdf clinical dosing instructions for cats.]</ref>

In 2005, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] sent a Notice of Violation to the manufacturer for its promotional materials which included promotion of the drug for off-label use.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/ComplianceEnforcement/ucm042460.pdf US FDA Notice of Violation] for off-label use promotion, April 2005.</ref>

====European Union====
In Europe, where the product has been available since the early 1990s,{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} it is licensed for other anti-inflammatory benefits including relief from both [[acute pain|acute]] and [[chronic pain]] in dogs. In June 2007, an oral version of meloxicam was licensed for the long-term relief of pain in cats.
Meloxicam is also licenced for use in horses, to relieve the pain associated with [[musculoskeletal]] disorders.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Maddison|editor1-first=JE|editor2-last=Page|editor2-first=SW|editor3-last=Church|editor3-first=D|title=Small animal clinical pharmacology|date=2008|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|location=Edinburgh|isbn=9780702028588|pages=301-302|edition=2nd|chapter=Meloxicam}}</ref>

====Other countries====
As of June 2008, meloxicam is registered for long-term use in cats in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada.
