'''Serutan''' was an early fiber-type [[laxative]] product which was widely promoted on [[United States|U.S.]] [[radio]] and [[television]] from the 1930s through the 1960s. Serutan was folded into Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s 1957 acquisition of J. B. Williams Co., founded in 1885.<ref>{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Times| first = Special To The New York| title = SALES AND MERGERS; Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

B. Williams Co. was bought out by [[Nabisco]] in 1971.

The origin of the brand name was straightforward. The makers merely decided to spell "natures" backwards, and "Read it backwards" was the product's [[advertising]] [[slogan]]. This was to differentiate it as being a "natural" product as opposed to laxative brands which stimulated the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] by chemical action. 

The product was almost uniformly promoted on programs whose core audience was known to be considerably older than the typical television viewer. Serutan is especially associated with ''[[The Lawrence Welk Show]]'' and ''[[The Original Amateur Hour]]'', both of which were also sponsored by J. B. Williams products [[Sominex]], a sleeping pill, and [[Geritol]], a vitamin supplement. Serutan was the target of numerous jokes by [[Bob Hope]] and other radio comedians during the 1930s and 1940s.

==Popular culture==

In Harvard Lampoon's ''[[Bored of the Rings]]'', the parody version of [[Saruman]] is named Serutan.  

In ''[[National Lampoon's Doon]]'', the parody version of [[Princess Irulan]] is named Princess Serutan.

[[Don De Lillo]]'s ''Libra'' mentions the slogan in its first chapter.

In ''Exit The Body'', a play by Fred Carmichael, Kate Bixley refers to the protagonist's husband, who writes a newspaper column under the alias "Dorothy Duckworth" and is attending a convention for lonely-hearts column writers, as "The only female at the convention who ''doesn't'' take Serutan."

A running gag in the 1944-1945 season of the Jack Benny Radio Show was a series of commercials by Frank Nelson for "Sympathy Soothing Cream", which used the slogan "Sympathy spelled backwards is Yhtapmys."  Several variations were introduced, most notably the rival brand, Sdrawrof cream.

In the Looney Tunes cartoon "￼￼[[Rocket-bye_Baby|Rocket-bye Baby,]]" a message from the planet Mars is signed Sir U Tan.

Archaeologist Kent Flannery has used the term "Serutan" to describe systemic archaeologists. (Flannery 1973a:49-53)
