'''Nitroxoline''' is an [[antibiotic]]<ref name="pmid7793877">{{cite journal |vauthors=Pelletier C, Prognon P, Bourlioux P |title=Roles of divalent cations and pH in mechanism of action of nitroxoline against Escherichia coli strains |journal=Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=707–13 |year=1995 |pmid=7793877 |doi= 10.1128/aac.39.3.707|url=http://aac.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7793877 |pmc=162609}}</ref> that has been in use in Europe for about fifty years, and has proven to be very effective at combating [[biofilm]] infections.  Nitroxoline was shown to cause a decrease in the biofilm density of ''[[P. aeruginosa]]'' infections, which would allow access to the infection by the immune system ''in vivo''.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sobke A, Klinger M, Hermann B, Sachse S, Nietzsche S, Makarewicz O, Keller PM, Pfister W, Straube E |title=The Urinary Antibiotic 5-Nitro-8-Hydroxyquinoline (Nitroxoline) Reduces the Formation and Induces the Dispersal of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms by Chelation of Iron and Zinc |journal=Antimicrob. Agents Chemother.  |volume=56 |pages=6021–6025 |year=2012 |url=http://aac.asm.org/content/56/11/6021 |issue=11 |doi=10.1128/aac.01484-12 |pmid=22926564 |pmc=3486607}}</ref> It was shown that nitroxoline functions by [[chelating]] Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions from the biofilm matrix; when Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> were reintroduced into the system, biofilm formation was reconstituted.  The activity of biofilm degradation is comparable to [[EDTA]], but has a history of human use in clinical settings and therefore has a precedent with which to allow its use against “slimy” biofilm infections.

==Anticancer Activity==
The chelating activities of nitroxoline have also been used in an anticancer setting.  Nitroxoline has been shown to be more [[cytotoxic]] to [[HL60]], DHL-4, Panc-1, and A2780 cells lines than [[clioquinol]] and other [[8-hydroxyquinoline]] derivatives.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Jiang H, Taggart JE, Zhang X, Benbrook DM, Lind SE, Ding W |title=Nitroxoline (8-hydroxy-5-nitroquinoline) is more a potent anti-cancer agent than clioquinol (5-chloro-7-iodo-8-quinoline) |journal=Cancer Lett |volume=312 |pages=11–17 |year=2011 |pmc=3395224 |doi=10.1016/j.canlet.2011.06.032 |pmid=21899946 |issue=1}}</ref>   It also demonstrated an increase in [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) production over controls, especially when Cu<sup>2+</sup> was added.  The ROS levels reached over 350% of the controls with addition of CuCl<sub>2</sub>.  Interestingly, the cytotoxicity production was markedly decreased with addition of ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, indicating, based on this model, that nitroxoline is not a zinc chelator.  Because the zinc chelating action of clioquinol has been associated with [[subacute myelo-optic neuropathy]], the use of nitroxoline as a cytotoxic drug in the treatment of cancers should not exhibit neurotoxic effects in humans, and ''in vivo'' trials on tumour xenografts in mice have not yielded any negative neurodegenerative effects.

Nitroxoline has been shown to [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibit the enzymatic activity]] of [[cathepsin B]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mirkovic B, Renko M, Turk S, Sosic I, Jevnikar Z, Obermajer N, Turk D, Gobec S, Kos J |title=Novel Mechanism of Cathepsin B Inhibition by Antibiotic Nitroxoline and Related Compounds |journal=ChemMedChem |volume=6 |pages=1351–1356 |year=2011  |doi=10.1002/cmdc.201100098}}</ref>  Cathepsin B degrades extra-cellular membrane proteins in tumor cells, allowing them to proliferate more freely, and metastasize throughout the body.  Nitroxoline was shown to be a noncompetitive, reversible inhibitor of these actions in MCF-10A neoT cells.  The ''K''<sub>i</sub> ([[dissociation constant]]) values it demonstrates are comparable to other reversible inhibitors of cathepsin B.  This indicates that it may be a candidate for further trials as an anticancer drug, especially given its history as an antimicrobial agent and its well-known [[pharmacokinetic]] profile.  The mechanism of action by which nitroxoline inhibits cathepsin B may also suggest that further research of noncovalent, noncompetitive inhibitors of cathepsin B could be warranted.  In fact, it was recently shown that a balance exists between the potency and the kinetics of a molecule, reflected in the molecular weight, which must be optimized in order to create the best drug for inhibition of a target enzyme.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sosic I, Mirkovic B, Arenz K, Stefane B, Kos J, Gobec S |title=Development of New Cathepsin B Inhibitors: Combining Bioisosteric Replacements and Structure-Based Design To Explore the Structure-Activity Relationships of Nitroxoline Derivatives |journal=J Med Chem |volume=56 |pages=521–533 |year=2013 |url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm301544x |doi=10.1021/jm301544x}}</ref>  For example, a certain inhibitor may have a high affinity for an enzyme, but it may prove impractical to use in a clinical setting for treatment because of its size.

Nitroxoline and its analogues have also been shown to have [[antiangiogenic]] properties.<ref name="doi=10.1093/jnci/djq457">{{cite journal |author=Joong Sup Shim, Yoshiyuki Matsui, Shridhar Bhat, Benjamin A. Nacev, Jing Xu, Hyo-eun CB, Surajit Dhara, Kee Chung Han, Curtis R. Chong, Martin G. Pomper, Alan So Jun O.

With different derivatives of nitroxoline demonstrating various levels of inhibition, nitroxoline may also prove to be a novel starting point for future research into cancer treatment.
