'''Fingolimod''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], trade name '''Gilenya''',	Novartis) is an immunomodulating drug, mostly used for treating [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS).<ref name=AHFS2015/> It has reduced the rate of relapses in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis by approximately one-half over a two-year period.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sanford|first1=M|title=Fingolimod: a review of its use in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.|journal=Drugs|date=August 2014|volume=74|issue=12|pages=1411–33|pmid=25063048|doi=10.1007/s40265-014-0264-y}}</ref> Fingolimod is a [[sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor]] [[Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator|modulator]], which sequesters lymphocytes in lymph nodes, preventing them from contributing to an autoimmune reaction.

==Medical uses==
Fingolimod is used in the treatment of the relapsing form of [[multiple sclerosis]].<!-- <ref name=AHFS2015/> --> Its effect in those with primary progressive MS is not clear.<!-- <ref name=AHFS2015/> --> May also be used in [[chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy]].<ref name=AHFS2015>{{cite web|title=Fingolimod Hydrochloride|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/fingolimod-hydrochloride.html|publisher=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=Aug 9, 2015}}</ref> It was originally proposed as an [[antirejection medication]] indicated after transplantation but it failed to show any significant benefit in post-transplantation clinical trials.

==Side effects==
The most common side effects of fingolimod have been head colds, headache, and fatigue. A few cases of skin cancer have been reported, which has also been reported in patients taking [[natalizumab]] (Tysabri), an approved MS drug.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/multiple-sclerosis/news/20080416/good-news-for-oral-ms-drug-fingolimod |title=Good News for Oral MS Drug Fingolimod |publisher=Webmd.com |date=2008-04-16 |accessdate=2013-09-30}}</ref> Fingolimod has also been associated with potentially fatal infections, bradycardia and, recently, a case of hemorrhaging focal [[encephalitis]], an inflammation of the brain with bleeding.<ref>{{vcite2 journal |vauthors=Leypoldt F, Münchau A, Moeller F, Bester M, Gerloff C, Heesen C |title=Hemorrhaging focal encephalitis under fingolimod (FTY720) treatment: a case report |journal=Neurology |volume=72 |issue=11 |pages=1022–4 |year=2009 |pmid= 19289744|doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000344567.51394.e3}}</ref> Two people died: one due to brain herpes infection, and a second one due to [[zoster]].

The [[European Medicines Agency]] has advised doctors to increase their level of monitoring of people after the first dose of the medicine. This includes electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring before treatment and then continuously for the first six hours after the first dose, and measurement of blood pressure and heart rate every hour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/news_and_events/news/2012/01/news_detail_001425.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058004d5c1 |title=European Medicines Agency - News and Events - European Medicines Agency starts review of Gilenya (fingolimod) |publisher=Ema.europa.eu |date=2012-01-20 |accessdate=2013-09-30}}</ref>

==Structure and mechanism==
It is derived from [[myriocin]] (ISP-1), a metabolite of the fungus ''[[Isaria sinclairii]]''. It is a structural [[analog (chemistry)|analogue]] of [[sphingosine]] and is [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] by [[sphingosine kinase]]s in the cell (most importantly sphingosine kinase 2).<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Paugh SW, Payne SG, Barbour SE, Milstien S, Spiegel S |title=The immunosuppressant FTY720 is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase type 2 |journal=FEBS Lett |volume=554 |issue=1–2 |pages=189–93 |year=2003 |pmid=14596938 |doi=10.1016/S0014-5793(03)01168-2}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Billich A, Bornancin F, Dévay P, Mechtcheriakova D, Urtz N, Baumruker T |title=Phosphorylation of the immunomodulatory drug FTY720 by sphingosine kinases |journal=J Biol Chem |volume=278 |issue=48 |pages=47408–15 |year=2003 |pmid=13129923 |doi=10.1074/jbc.M307687200}} [http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/278/48/47408 Free full text]</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| pmid=12954648 | year=2003 | last1=Sanchez | first1=T | last2=Estrada-Hernandez | first2=T | last3=Paik | first3=JH | last4=Wu | first4=MT | last5=Venkataraman | first5=K | last6=Brinkmann | first6=V | last7=Claffey | first7=K | last8=Hla | first8=T | title=Phosphorylation and action of the immunomodulator FTY720 inhibits vascular endothelial cell growth factor-induced vascular permeability | volume=278 | issue=47 | pages=47281–90 | doi=10.1074/jbc.M306896200 | journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry }}</ref> The molecular biology of phospho-fingolimod is thought to lie in its activity at one of the five sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors, [[S1PR1]].<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Hla T, Lee MJ, Ancellin N, Paik JH, Kluk MJ |title=Lysophospholipids--receptor revelations |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=294 |issue=5548 |pages=1875–8 |year=2001 |pmid=11729304 |doi=10.1126/science.1065323}}</ref>  Phospho-fingolimod causes the internalization of S1P receptors, which sequesters [[lymphocytes]] in lymph nodes, preventing them from moving to the central nervous system and cause a relapse in [[multiple sclerosis]].

==History==
First synthesized in 1992 by Yoshitomi Pharmaceuticals, fingolimod was derived from an immunosuppressive natural product, [[myriocin]] (ISP-I)  through chemical modification.  Myriocin was isolated from the culture broth a type of [[entomopathogenic fungus]] (''[[Isaria sinclairii]]'') that was an [[eternal youth]] nostrum in traditional Chinese medicine.<ref name="Adachi2007">{{Cite journal| last1=Adachi | first1=K | last2=Chiba | first2=K | title=FTY720 Story.

[[Structure activity relationship]] (SAR) studies on myriocin homologs and partially synthetic derivatives showed that the configuration at the carbon bearing the 3-hydroxy group or the 14-ketone, the 6-double bond, and the 4-hydroxy group were not important for its activity and simplification of the structure of ISP-I was done in an attempt to reduce toxicity and improve drugability.<ref name="Adachi2007" />

Elimination of side chain functionalities and removal of chiral centers was part of the simplification process and an intermediate compound (ISP-I-28) with the carboxylic acid of myriocin transformed to a hydroxymethyl group was generated.  ISP-I-28 was found to be less toxic and more effective at lengthening rat skin allograft time than ISP-1.

==Approval==
On September 21, 2010, fingolimod became the first ''oral'' disease-modifying drug approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] to reduce relapses and delay disability progression in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/gilenya.html |title=Gilenya Information from |publisher=Drugs.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-30}}</ref><ref>[http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm226755.htm FDA press release on approval of Gilenya]</ref> [[Novartis]] announced on March 10, 2011 that it had received a [[notice of compliance]] from [[Health Canada]] and that the drug would be available April 1, 2011 at pharmacies.<ref>First oral MS treatment approved for Canada http://www.vancouversun.com/health/First+oral+treatment+approved+Canada+says+drug+company/4420028/story.html</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.news-medical.net/news/20110310/Novartis-new-MS-treatment-receives-Notice-of-Compliance-in-Canada.aspx |date=10 March 2011 |title=Novartis new MS treatment receives Notice of Compliance in Canada |publisher=NewsMedical.net }}</ref> On March 17, 2011, the [[European Medicines Agency]] approved the drug for use in the European Union.<ref>[http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/002202/human_med_001433.jsp&murl=menus/medicines/medicines.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d125 EMA approval information about Gilenya]</ref>

===Multiple sclerosis===
In two Phase III clinical trials, fingolimod reduced the rate of relapses in relapsing-remitting [[multiple sclerosis]] by over half compared both to placebo and to the active comparator [[interferon beta-1a]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Jeffrey A.

A double-blind randomized control trial comparing fingolimod to placebo<ref>[http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00289978 Efficacy and Safety of Fingolimod in Patients With Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis.] ClinicalTrials.gov</ref>
found the drug reduced the annualized frequency of relapses to 0.18 relapses per year at 0.5&nbsp;mg/day or 0.16 relapses per year at 1.25&nbsp;mg/day, compared to 0.40 relapses per year for those patients taking the placebo. The probability of disease progression at 24 month followup was lower in the fingolimod groups compared to placebo (hazard ratio 0.70 at 0.5&nbsp;mg and 0.68 at 1.25&nbsp;mg). Fingolimod patients also had better results according to MRI imaging of new or enlarged lesions at 24 month followup. Side effects leading to discontinuation of the study drug were more common in the higher dose group (14.2% of patients) than at the lower dose (7.5%) or placebo (7.7%). Serious adverse events in the fingolimod group included [[bradycardia]], relapse, and [[basal-cell carcinoma]]. Seven episodes of bradycardia occurred during the monitoring period after administration of the first dose, and were asymptomatic in six of these cases. There was a higher rate of lower respiratory tract infections (including bronchitis and pneumonia) in the fingolimod groups (9.6% at 0.5&nbsp;mg, 11.4% at 1.5&nbsp;mg) than the placebo group (6.0%). Other adverse events reported on the study drug included [[macular edema]], cancer, and laboratory abnormalities.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors = Kappos L, Radue EW, O'Connor P, Polman C, Hohlfeld R, Calabresi P, Selmaj K, Agoropoulou C, Leyk M, Zhang-Auberson L, Burtin P,((for the FREEDOMS Study Group))|title=A placebo-controlled trial of oral fingolimod in relapsing multiple sclerosis |journal= New England Journal of Medicine |volume=362 |issue=5 |pages=387–401 |year=2010 |pmid=20089952 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0909494}}</ref>

(2005) 21:247-269</ref> Paks are widely expressed in mammalian tissue and at least three Pak isoforms exist in the heart, including Pak14. Pak1 has been shown to regulate many cellular functions in the heart including cell growth, survival, and motility.<ref name=Liu/><ref name=Mao/> Pak1 has also been implicated in the regulation of vital cardiac processes such as hypertrophy and contractility.<ref name=Ke/>

Previous studies have shown that Pak1 activation contributes to the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy through multiple mechanisms.<ref name=Mao>Mao, K., Kobayashi, S., Jaffer, Z.M., Huang, Y., Volden, P., Chernoff, J., and Liang, Q.

(2000) 105:875-886</ref> Contrary to this, a recent study has discovered Pak1 plays a cardioprotective role during the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy and thus heart failure.<ref name=Liu/> A knock-out mouse model and myocyte cell culture experiments have identified Pak1 as a key player in a signaling cascade relaying antihypertrophic signals within the heart. This effect is a result of a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent cascade directly downstream of Pak1 activation. Results of this study revealed fingolimod as a potential antihypertrophic cardiac treatment through its activation of Pak1 and the resultant antihypertrophic effects seen in animal models.<ref name=Liu/>

A study using ''ex vivo'' rat hearts and myocyte cell culture has also identified fingolimod as a candidate drug for preventing cardiac arrhythmias resulting from ischemic/reperfusion injury.<ref name=Egom/><ref name=Egom2/> Fingolimod prevents arrhythmias through the activation of Pak1 and its downstream effectors. These include upregulation of protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A) and subsequent dephosphorylation of troponin I (TnI,) and activation of the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling cascade.<ref name=Egom2/> The latter inhibits cardiac pacemaker rate by altering the activity of acetylcholine-regulated potassium channels (KACh).<ref>Guo, J., MacDonell, K.L., and Giles, W.R.
