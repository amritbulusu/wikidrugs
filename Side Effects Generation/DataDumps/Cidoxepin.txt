'''Cidoxepin''' (former developmental code name '''P-4599'''), also known as '''''cis''-doxepin''' or '''(''Z'')-doxepin''', is a [[tricyclic antidepressant]] which was developed in the 1960s but was never marketed.<ref name="Elks2014">{{cite book|author=J.

Cidoxepin has recently been reinvestigated and is now currently under development as an [[antihistamine]] by Elorac, Inc. for the treatment of chronic [[urticaria]] (hives).<ref name="AdisInsight">http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800032883</ref> As of 2017, it is in [[Phases of clinical research#Phase II|phase II]] [[clinical trial]]s for this indication.<ref name="AdisInsight" /> The drug was also under investigation for the treatment of [[allergic rhinitis]] (hay fever), [[atopic dermatitis]] (atopic [[eczema]]), and [[contact dermatitis]], but development for these indications was discontinued.<ref name="AdisInsight" />
