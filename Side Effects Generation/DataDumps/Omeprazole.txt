==Medical uses==
{{See also|Proton-pump inhibitor}}

Omeprazole can be used in the treatment of [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] (GERD), [[peptic ulcers]], [[erosive esophagitis]], and [[Zollinger-Ellison syndrome]].<ref name=AHFS2015/>

===Peptic ulcers===
Peptic ulcers may be treated with omeprazole. Treatment of ''H. pylori'' infection can be completed by taking a triple therapy combination of omeprazole, [[amoxicillin]], and [[clarithromycin]] for 7–14 days.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=17938394|year=2007|author1=Fuccio|first1=L|title=Meta-analysis: Duration of first-line proton-pump inhibitor based triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|volume=147|issue=8|pages=553–62|last2=Minardi|first2=M.

Since their introduction, proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs, especially omeprazole) have also been associated with several cases of [[acute interstitial nephritis]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Härmark |first1 = Linda | display-authors = et al |year = 2007 |title = Proton pump inhibitor‐induced acute interstitial nephritis | journal = British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 64 | issue = 6| pages = 819–823 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.2007.02927.x| pmid = 17635502 | pmc = 2198775 }}</ref> an inflammation of the [[kidneys]] that often occurs as an adverse drug reaction.

Long-term use of PPIs is strongly associated with the development of benign [[polyp (medicine)|polyps]] from [[fundic glands]] (which is distinct from [[fundic gland polyposis]]); these polyps do not cause cancer and resolve when PPIs are discontinued. No association is seen between PPI use and cancer, but use of PPIs may mask gastric cancers or other serious gastric problems and physicians should be aware of this effect.<ref name=Corleto2014>{{cite journal |author=Corleto, V.D. |title=Proton pump inhibitor therapy and potential long-term harm. |journal=Curr Opin Endocrinol Diabetes Obes|date=February 2014 |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=3–8 |pmid=24310148 |doi=10.1097/med.0000000000000031}}</ref>

There is a tentative association between long term use and dementia which requires further study to confirm.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Eusebi|first1=LH|last2=Rabitti|first2=S|last3=Artesiani|first3=ML|last4=Gelli|first4=D|last5=Montagnani|first5=M|last6=Zagari|first6=RM|last7=Bazzoli|first7=F|title=Proton pump inhibitors: Risks of long-term use.|journal=Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology|date=July 2017|volume=32|issue=7|pages=1295–1302|doi=10.1111/jgh.13737|pmid=28092694}}</ref>

===Pregnancy and breast-feeding===
Epidemiological data do not show an increased risk of major birth defects after maternal use of omeprazole during [[pregnancy]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1002689 |pmid=21105793 |title=Use of Proton-Pump Inhibitors in Early Pregnancy and the Risk of Birth Defects |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=363 |issue=22 |pages=2114–23 |year=2010 |last1=Pasternak |first1=Björn |last2=Hviid |first2=Anders}}</ref>

No [[clinical studies|clinical trials]] have deeply evaluated the potential consequences of the use of omeprazole in breastfeeding. However, the pharmacokinetics of omeprazole molecule strongly suggest the safety of omeprazole use during breastfeeding:
* Omeprazole has a high plasma protein binding rate (95%),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pdr.net/drug-summary/prilosec-delayed-release-capsules-and-oral-suspension?druglabelid=1123 |title=Omeprazole drug summary |publisher=PDR.net |date= |accessdate=2014-03-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303163837/http://www.pdr.net/drug-summary/prilosec-delayed-release-capsules-and-oral-suspension?druglabelid=1123 |archivedate=3 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> indicating that little amount of drug is transferred to the [[milk duct]] during breast milk formation.
* Omeprazole needs to be administrated in an enteric-coated formulation due to its rapid degradation in the acidic conditions of the stomach. This suggests that most of the free molecules ingested by the infant are likely degraded before being absorbed.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Omeprazole at normal doses is likely safe during breastfeeding.<ref>{{cite web|title=LACTMED: OMEPRAZOLE|url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search2/r?dbs+lactmed:@term+@rel+@rn+73590-58-6|accessdate=1 December 2015|date=2015-03-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908170635/https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search2/r?dbs+lactmed%253A%2540term+%2540rel+%2540rn+73590-58-6|archivedate=8 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Drugs that depend on an acidic stomach environment (such as [[ketoconazole]] or [[atazanavir]]) may be poorly absorbed, whereas acid-labile antibiotics (such as [[erythromycin]] which is a very strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) may be absorbed to a greater extent than normal due to the more alkaline environment of the stomach.<ref name=Stedman/>

Proton-pump inhibitors like omeprazole have been found to increase the plasma concentrations of [[methotrexate]].<ref name = MD>{{cite web |title=Methotrexate |work=Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference |publisher=Pharmaceutical Press |date=6 January 2014 |accessdate=12 April 2014 |url= http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/martindale/current/ms-9550-n.htm |editor=Brayfield, A}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
===Mechanism of action===
Omeprazole is a selective and irreversible proton pump inhibitor. It suppresses stomach acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase system found at the secretory surface of gastric [[parietal cells]]. Because this enzyme system is regarded as the acid (proton, or H<sup>+</sup>) pump within the gastric mucosa, omeprazole inhibits the final step of acid production.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Omeprazole also inhibits both basal and stimulated acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00338#pharmacology |title=DrugBank: Omeprazole (DB00338) |publisher=Drugbank.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205140533/http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00338#pharmacology |archivedate=5 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The inhibitory effect of omeprazole occurs within 1 hour after oral administration. The maximum effect occurs within 2 hours. The duration of inhibition is up to 72 hours. When omeprazole is stopped, baseline stomach acid secretory activity returns after 3 to 5 days. The inhibitory effect of omeprazole on acid secretion will plateau after 4 days of repeated daily dosing.<ref>[http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=bced816b-6927-49fb-851f-f83a678dac97#nlm34090-1 Omeprazole &#91;package insert&#93;.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419020303/http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=bced816b-6927-49fb-851f-f83a678dac97 |date=19 April 2014 }} India: Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited.

===Pharmacokinetics===
The absorption of omeprazole takes place in the small intestine and is usually completed within 3 to 6 hours. The systemic [[bioavailability]] of omeprazole after repeated dose is about 60%.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Omeprazole, as well as other PPIs, are only effective on active H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pumps. These pumps are stimulated in the presence of food to aid in digestion. For this reason, patients should be advised to take omeprazole with a glass of water on an empty stomach.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Katz | first1 = PO | last2 = Gerson | first2 = LB | last3 = Vela | first3 = MF | year = 2013 | title = Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease | url = | journal = Am J Gastroenterol | volume = 108 | issue = 3| pages = 308–28 | doi=10.1038/ajg.2012.444 | pmid=23419381}}</ref><ref>[http://pharmacistanswers.com/are-you-taking-your-medication-correctly-.html PharmacistAnswers Webpage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305221111/http://pharmacistanswers.com/are-you-taking-your-medication-correctly-.html |date=5 March 2014 }} Retrieved 27 February 2014</ref> Additionally, most sources recommend that after taking omeprazole, at least 30 minutes should be allowed to elapse before eating<ref>{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/omeprazole|title=Omeprazole, in The Free Medical Dictionary|accessdate=11 November 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/omeprazole.html|title=Omeprazole|publisher=Drugs.com|accessdate=11 November 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219135631/http://www.drugs.com/monograph/omeprazole.html|archivedate=19 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> (at least 60 minutes for immediate-release omeprazole plus sodium bicarbonate products, such as Zegerid),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rxlist.com/zegerid-drug-patient.htm#howtake |title=Zegird, How to take |publisher=rxlist.com |accessdate=11 November 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026072806/http://www.rxlist.com/zegerid-drug-patient.htm#howtake |archivedate=26 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> though some sources say that with delayed-release forms of omeprazole, waiting before eating after taking the medication is not necessary.<ref>[http://www.mims.com/page.aspx?menuid=mng&name=omeprazole+omeprazole essential drug information].

Omeprazole is completely metabolized by the [[cytochrome P450]] system, mainly in the liver. Identified metabolites are the [[sulfone]], the [[sulfide]], and hydroxy-omeprazole, which exert no significant effect on acid secretion. About 80% of an orally given dose is excreted as metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found in the feces, primarily originating from bile secretion.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Chemistry==
[[File:Omeprazole enantiomers.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|(''S'')-(−) and (''R'')-(+)-[[enantiomer]]s of omeprazole, a [[racemate]] (1:1 mixture of both enantiomers)]] {{clear left}}
Omeprazole contains a tricoordinated sulfinyl sulfur in a pyramidal structure and therefore can exist as either the (''S'')- or (''R'')-[[enantiomer]]s. Omeprazole is a [[racemate]], an equal mixture of the two. In the acidic conditions of the [[canaliculus (parietal cell)|canaliculi]] of [[parietal cells]], both enantiomers are converted to  [[chiral]] products ([[sulfenic acid]] and [[sulfenamide]] configurations) which react with a [[cysteine]] group in [[Hydrogen potassium ATPase|H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase]], thereby inhibiting the ability of the parietal cells to produce [[gastric acid]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

:[[File:omeprazol.svg|400px|Omeprazol rearrangement in the body]]

[[AstraZeneca]] has also [[drug development|developed]] [[esomeprazole]] (Nexium) which is a [[eutomer]], purely the (''S'')-enantiomer, rather than a racemate like omeprazole.

Omeprazole undergoes a [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral shift]] ''[[in vivo]]'' which converts the inactive (''R'')-enantiomer to the active (''S'')-enantiomer, doubling the concentration of the active form.<ref name="www1.astrazeneca-us.com">[http://www1.astrazeneca-us.com/pi/Nexium.pdf Nexium Prescribing Information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008000830/http://www1.astrazeneca-us.com/pi/Nexium.pdf |date=8 October 2009 }}. AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals.</ref> This chiral shift is accomplished by the [[CYP2C19]] [[isozyme]] of [[cytochrome P450]], which is not found equally in all human populations. Those who do not metabolize the drug effectively are called "poor metabolizers". The proportion of the poor metabolizer [[phenotype]] varies widely between populations, from 2.0–2.5% in African Americans and white Americans to >20% in Asians; several [[pharmacogenomics]] studies have suggested that PPI treatment should be [[personalized medicine|tailored]] according to CYP2C19 metabolism status.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Furuta T, Shirai N, Sugimoto M, Nakamura A, Hishida A, Ishizaki T | title = Influence of CYP2C19 pharmacogenetic polymorphism on proton pump inhibitor-based therapies | journal = Drug Metab Pharmacokinet | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 153–67 |date=Jun 2005 | pmid = 15988117 | doi = 10.2133/dmpk.20.153}}</ref>

===Measurement in body fluids===
Omeprazole may be quantified in plasma or serum to monitor therapy or to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients. Plasma omeprazole concentrations are usually in a range of 0.2–1.2&nbsp;mg/l in persons receiving the drug therapeutically by the oral route and 1–6&nbsp;mg/l in victims of acute overdose. Enantiomeric [[chromatography|chromatographic]] methods are available to distinguish esomeprazole from racemic omeprazole.<ref>Baselt RC, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 1146–7. {{ISBN|978-0-9626523-7-0}}.</ref>

==History==
{{main|Discovery and development of proton pump inhibitors }}
Omeprazole was first marketed in the United States in 1989 by [[Astra AB]], now AstraZeneca, under the brand name Losec. In 1990, at the request of the [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]], the brand name Losec was changed to Prilosec to avoid confusion with the [[diuretic]] Lasix ([[furosemide]]).<ref name=farley>{{cite journal |last        = Farley |first       = D |title       = Making it easier to read prescriptions |journal     = [[FDA Consum]] |volume      = 29 |issue       = 6 |pages       = 25–7 |date        = July–August 1995 |pmid        = 10143448 |url         = http://www.thebody.com/content/art13913.html |deadurl     = no |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120315172345/http://www.thebody.com/content/art13913.html |archivedate = 15 March 2012 |df          = dmy-all}}</ref> The new name led to confusion between omeprazole (Prilosec) and [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac), an [[antidepressant]].<ref name=farley />

When Prilosec's U.S. patent expired in April 2001, AstraZeneca introduced esomeprazole (Nexium) as a patented replacement drug.<ref>{{cite news |title=Prilosec's Maker Switches Users To Nexium, Thwarting Generics |author=Gardiner Harris |work=The Wall Street Journal |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1023326369679910840 |date=6 June 2002 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806181248/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1023326369679910840 |archivedate=6 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  Many companies introduced generics as AstraZeneca's patents expired worldwide, which are available under many brand names.

==Dosage forms==
[[File:Omeprazole 10mg UK.jpg|thumb|Omeprazole 10-mg, from UK]]
Omeprazole is available as tablets and capsules (containing omeprazole or omeprazole magnesium) in strengths of 10, 20, 40, and in some markets 80&nbsp;mg; and as a powder (omeprazole sodium) for [[intravenous]] injection. Most oral omeprazole preparations are [[enteric coating|enteric-coated]], due to the rapid degradation of the drug in the acidic conditions of the stomach. This is most commonly achieved by formulating enteric-coated granules within capsules, enteric-coated tablets, and the multiple-unit pellet system (MUPS).<ref>Jerome Aubert*, Chris JJ Mulder†, Karsten Schrör**, Stephan R Vavricka††.

It is also available for use in injectable form (IV) in Europe, but not in the U.S. The injection pack is a combination pack consisting of a vial and a separate ampule of reconstituting solution. Each 10-ml clear glass vial contains a white to off-white lyophilised powder consisting of omeprazole sodium 42.6&nbsp;mg, equivalent to 40&nbsp;mg of omeprazole.

Omeprazole is also available as an oral suspension of enteric-coated beads in the UK as an unlicensed product. Oral suspensions are predominantly used for children, but can also be used by those with difficulty swallowing or those using a feeding tube.
