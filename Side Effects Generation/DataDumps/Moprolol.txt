Typically moprolol is prescribed to treat [[hypertension]], high blood pressure, [[Anxiety disorder|anxiety]], and [[glaucoma]]<sup><ref>{{Cite web|title = Human Metabolome Database: Showing metabocard for Moprolol (HMDB41935)|url = http://www.hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB41935|website = www.hmdb.ca|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}</ref></sup>. Moprolol was first introduced by SIMS, or S.p.A Societa Italiana Medicinali e Sintetici, in 1982. SIMS is a private Italian company that has been present in the pharmaceutical industry since 1937. In 1972 SIMS first submitted a [[Drug Master File|Drug Master file]] to the US [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] and has continued to do so over the years.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Storia SIMS Italy|url = http://www.simsitaly.it/storia-azienda-sims.php|website = www.simsitaly.it|accessdate = 2015-12-05|language = en-us}}</ref> In addition to formulating moprolol SIMES has also manufactured Omeral and Levotensin, derivatives of moprolol.

== Regulation History ==

Moprolol was prominent in both literature and clinical trials up until the 1990s. At this point moprolol was pulled from the market. This could have been for a number of reasons, including FDA recalls and ineffective formulations. Through some clinical trials it was seen that moprolol was not as effective for treating blood pressure as originally thought, and this will be covered in the clinical section.

Even though there were no specific FDA recalls issued for moprolol, the FDA has issued warnings to SIMS. In 2000 the FDA and the United States Department of Health and Sciences issued a warning letter to the SIMS facility.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Warning Letters and Notice of Violation Letters to Pharmaceutical Companies - Warning Letters 2000|url = http://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/enforcementactivitiesbyfda/warninglettersandnoticeofviolationletterstopharmaceuticalcompanies/ucm164551.htm|website = www.fda.gov|accessdate = 2015-12-14|first = Center for Drug Evaluation and|last = Research}}</ref> In this letter it stated that during a routine inspection of the SIMS facility it was found that there were significant deviations from the US [[Good manufacturing practice|good]] manufacturing practices when manufacturing active pharmaceutical ingredients. SIMS was then notified that until these deviations were corrected and another FDA inspection was completed the FDA will disapprove any applications for active pharmaceutical ingredients from the SIMS facility.

Then in June 2015 the FDA issued an Import alert including SIMS.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Import Alert 66-66|url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_202.html|website = www.accessdata.fda.gov|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref> This alert stated that some active pharmaceutical ingredients appeared to be misbranded. Therefore, any active pharmaceutical ingredients can be refused admission if the facility they are from is listed in this alert.

Before being pulled from the market moprolol was a prescription drug, meaning it must be prescribed from a doctor, and could not be given over the counter.

== Clinical Studies ==
Moprolol has been the subject for many clinical trials to study the effect moprolol has on both blood pressure and glaucoma.

In many hypertension and blood pressure studies the moprolol is prescribed as a tablet given once a day, typically on a schedule. For glaucoma studies moprolol is typically prescribed as an ophthalmic solution where ½ a drop of 1% moprolol solution was given 2-3 times a day.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 0118940 USE OF L-MOPROLOL FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF A FLUID OPHTHALMIC COMPOSITION FOR TREATING GLAUCOMA|url = https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=EP11491007&recNum=5&maxRec=1664&office=&prevFilter=&sortOption=Relevance&queryString=ALLTXT%253A%2528Moprolol%2529&tab=PCTDescription|website = patentscope.wipo.int|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref> The specific dosages and concentrations can vary depending on the severity of the condition.

One significant clinical study in hypertension ran in 2013 using non-selective beta-blocker to study the effects on lowering blood pressure.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Blood pressure lowering efficacy of nonselective beta-blockers for primary hypertension|url = http://www.cochranelibrary.com/enhanced/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007452.pub2|doi = 10.1002/14651858.cd007452.pub2|first = Gavin WK|last = Wong|first2 = James M|last2 = Wright}}</ref> In this study 30 participants were given 75&nbsp;mg of moprolol twice a day. Through this study it was found that moprolol had no significant effect on lowering the heart rate.

Another important clinical trial for the treatment of glaucoma with moprolol was conducted in 1994.<ref name=":0" /> This was a double-blind prospective trial to test the efficacy of lowering intraocular pressure when using l-moprolol alone and in combination with dipivefrin. In this study 27 patients that had glaucoma or ocular hypertension were given l-moprolol eye drops twice a day for 4 weeks. After this a combination of l-moprolol and dipivefrin eye drops were given for another 4 weeks. Through this study it was found that l-moprolol was a good treatment for glaucoma but that a treatment consisting of a combination of hypertension medications can have a greater effect at lowering ocular pressure.

Both studies show that moprolol, or its derivatives, has some effect at lowering blood pressure but may not have an effect on the heart rate. This opens a way for future studies, especially in the treatment for glaucoma.

== Commercialization ==
Moprolol was first patented by SIMS in 1987 under US patent number 4647590.<ref>{{Citation|title = Pharmaceutical compositions and their use in the treatment of glaucoma|url = http://www.google.co.ve/patents/US4647590|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref> In this patent SIMS states that moprolol can be used to treat glaucoma when administered locally as well as arterial hypertension. Then it goes into the studies conducted that proved the effectiveness of moprolol to treat these conditions without having the side effects of treatments on the market. This led to many other patents over the years, a few of which are listed in the table below:

As previously mentioned moprolol is currently off the market, most likely due to the SIMS facility being in violation of US good manufacturing practices. This means that currently there are no sales being brought in by moprolol.

That being said there is still a huge market for moprolol, both for hypertension and glaucoma treatment. A similar beta-blocker, metoprolol, that is very popular both overseas and in the US brought in an estimated €2.2 million in 2010 in Europe.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.recordati.com/resources/Pubblicazione/___c704bb007ee74caba42916d7e680ff1d_/annual-report-2010.pdf|title = Annual Report 2010|date = |accessdate = |website = Recordati|publisher = Recordati S.p.A|last = |first = }}</ref> Metoprolol is also sold for $2.93-$0.76 per pill here in the US.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Buy  The Cheapest Offers|url = http://plusvision.eu/toprol-xl-price|website = plusvision.eu|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref> Since moprolol and metoprolol both treat hypertension the market and estimated sales should be the same, all of which is reasonable for this type of non-invasive treatment.
