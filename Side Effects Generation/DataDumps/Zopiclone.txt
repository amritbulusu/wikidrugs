'''Zopiclone''' (brand names Zimovane and Imovane) is a [[nonbenzodiazepine]] [[hypnotic]] agent used in the treatment of [[insomnia]]. Zopiclone is molecularly distinct from benzodiazepine drugs and is classed as a [[cyclopyrrolone]]. However, zopiclone increases the normal transmission of the [[neurotransmitter]] [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid]] in the central nervous system, via modulating benzodiazepine receptors in the same way that [[benzodiazepine]] drugs do.

As zopiclone is [[sedative|sedating]], it is marketed as a sleeping pill. It works by causing a depression or tranquilization of the central nervous system.  After prolonged use, the body can become accustomed to the effects of zopiclone. When the dose is then reduced or the drug is abruptly stopped, withdrawal symptoms may result. These can include a range of symptoms similar to those of [[benzodiazepine withdrawal]]. Although withdrawal from therapeutic doses of zopiclone and its isomers (i.e. [[eszopiclone]]) do not typically present with convulsions and are therefore not considered life-threatening, patients may experience such significant agitation or anxiety that they seek emergency medical attention.

In the United States, zopiclone is not commercially available,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/cons/zopiclone.html |title=Zopiclone consumer information from |publisher=Drugs.com |accessdate=2013-06-06}}</ref> although its active [[stereoisomer]], [[eszopiclone]], is sold under the name Lunesta. Zopiclone is a controlled substance in the United States, Japan, [[Brazil]], and some European countries, and may be illegal to possess without a prescription. However, it is readily available in other countries where it is marketed under the brand name Imovane, and is not a controlled substance in its available 7.5&nbsp;mg, 5&nbsp;mg, and 3.75&nbsp;mg oral tablet formulations.

Zopiclone is known colloquially as a "[[Z-drug]]". Other Z-drugs include [[zaleplon]] (Sonata) and [[zolpidem]] (Ambien and AmbienCR) and were initially thought to be less addictive or habit-forming than benzodiazepines. However, this appraisal has shifted somewhat in the last few years as cases of addiction and habituation have been presented. Zopiclone is recommended to be taken on a short-term basis, usually a week or less.<ref>http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/TA077publicinfoenglish.pdf</ref> Daily or continuous use of the drug is not usually advised, and caution must be taken when the compound is used in conjunction with antidepressants, sedatives or other drugs affecting the central nervous system.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=2744064 |url= |year=1989 |author=Van, Der, Kleijn, E |title=Effects of zopiclone and temazepam on sleep, behaviour and mood during the day |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=247–251 |issn=0031-6970 |journal=European journal of clinical pharmacology |doi=10.1007/BF00558155 }}</ref>

==Medical uses==
[[File:Zopiclone 7.5mg.jpg|thumb|right|A 7.5 mg zopiclone tablet]]
Zopiclone is indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia where sleep initiation or sleep maintenance are prominent symptoms. Long-term use is not recommended, as [[drug tolerance|tolerance]], dependence, and addiction can occur with prolonged use.<ref>{{cite journal |title=What's wrong with prescribing hypnotics? |journal=Drug Ther Bull |volume=42 |issue=12 |pages=89–93 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15587763 |doi= 10.1136/dtb.2004.421289|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Touitou Y |title=[Sleep disorders and hypnotic agents: medical, social and economical impact] |language=French |journal=Ann Pharm Fr |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=230–238 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17652991 |doi= |url=}}</ref> One low quality study found that zopiclone is ineffective in improving sleep quality or increasing sleep time in [[shift work]]ers - more research in this area has been recommended.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Pharmacological interventions for sleepiness and sleep disturbances caused by shift work|journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date = 2014|issn = 1469-493X|pmid = 25113164|pages = CD009776|volume = 8|doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD009776.pub2|first = Juha|last = Liira|first2 = Jos H.|last2 = Verbeek|first3 = Giovanni|last3 = Costa|first4 = Tim R.|last4 = Driscoll|first5 = Mikael|last5 = Sallinen|first6 = Leena K.|last6 = Isotalo|first7 = Jani H.|last7 = Ruotsalainen}}</ref>

===Elderly===
Zopiclone, similar to other benzodiazepines and [[nonbenzodiazepine]] [[hypnotic]] drugs, causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. The combination with alcohol consumption increases these impairments. Partial, but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments.<ref name="Mets-2010">{{Cite journal | last1 = Mets | first1 = M.A. | last2 = Volkerts | first2 = E.R. | last3 = Olivier | first3 = B. | last4 = Verster | first4 = J.C. | title = Effect of hypnotic drugs on body balance and standing steadiness | journal = Sleep Medicine Reviews | volume = 14 |date=February 2010 | issue = 4 | pages = 259–267 | doi = 10.1016/j.smrv.2009.10.008 | pmid = 20171127 }}</ref>

An extensive review of the medical literature regarding the management of insomnia and the elderly found that considerable evidence of the effectiveness and lasting benefits of nondrug treatments for insomnia exist. Compared with the benzodiazepines, the nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics, such as zopiclone, offer few if any advantages in efficacy or tolerability in elderly persons. Newer agents such as the [[Melatonin receptor agonist]]s may be more suitable and effective for the management of chronic insomnia in elderly people. Long-term use of sedative-hypnotics for insomnia lacks an evidence base and is discouraged for reasons that include concerns about such potential adverse drug effects as [[Developmental disability|cognitive impairment]] ([[anterograde amnesia]]), daytime sedation, motor incoordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls. In addition, the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drugs remains to be determined.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Am J Geriatr Pharmacother |date=June 2006 | volume = 4 | issue = 2 |pages = 168–192 | title = Management of chronic insomnia in elderly persons | author = Bain KT | pmid = 16860264 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjopharm.2006.06.006}}</ref>

==Adverse reactions==
The [[British National Formulary]] states adverse reactions as follows: "taste disturbance; less commonly nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, headache; rarely amnesia, confusion, depression, hallucinations, nightmares; very rarely light headedness, incoordination, paradoxical effects [...] and sleep-walking also reported".<ref name=bnf>{{citation |publisher=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence |date=19 September 2016 |url=https://www.evidence.nhs.uk/document?ci=https%3a%2f%2fwww.evidence.nhs.uk%2fformulary%2fbnf%2fcurrent%2f4-central-nervous-system%2f41-hypnotics-and-anxiolytics%2f411-hypnotics%2fzaleplon-zolpidem-and-zopiclone%2fzopiclone&returnUrl=Search%3fq%3dzopiclone&q=zopiclone |title=Zopiclone |work=British National Formulary}}</ref>

==Contraindications==
Zopiclone causes [[driving under the influence|impaired driving]] skills similar to those of benzodiazepines. Long-term users of hypnotic drugs for [[sleep disorder]]s develop only partial tolerance to adverse effects on driving with users of hypnotic drugs even after 1 year of use still showing an increased motor vehicle accident rate.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Staner L, Ertlé S, Boeijinga P, etal |title=Next-day residual effects of hypnotics in DSM-IV primary insomnia: a driving simulator study with simultaneous electroencephalogram monitoring |journal=Psychopharmacology |volume=181 |issue=4 |pages=790–798 |date=October 2005 |pmid=16025317 |doi=10.1007/s00213-005-0082-8 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/q3742117g8140426/fulltext.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref> Patients who drive motor vehicles should not take zopiclone unless they stop driving due to a significant increased risk of accidents in zopiclone users.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Barbone F, McMahon AD, Davey PG, etal |title=Association of road-traffic accidents with benzodiazepine use |journal=Lancet |volume=352 |issue=9137 |pages=1331–1336 |date=October 1998 |pmid=9802269 |doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(98)04087-2|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(98)04087-2/fulltext}}</ref> Zopiclone induces impairment of psychomotor function.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Yasui M |author2=Kato A |author3=Kanemasa T |author4=Murata S |author5=Nishitomi K |author6=Koike K |author7=Tai N |author8=Shinohara S |author9=Tokomura M |author10=Horiuchi M |author11=Abe K |title=[Pharmacological profiles of benzodiazepinergic hypnotics and correlations with receptor subtypes] |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=143–151 |date=June 2005 |pmid=16045197 |journal=Nihon Shinkei Seishin Yakurigaku Zasshi }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=2278337 |url= |date=December 1990 |author1=Rettig, Hc |author2=De, Haan, P |author3=Zuurmond, Ww |author4=Von, Leeuwen, L |title=Effects of hypnotics on sleep and psychomotor performance.

Zopiclone is in the [[cyclopyrrolone]] family of drugs. Other cyclopyrrolone drugs include [[suriclone]]. Zopiclone, although molecularly different from benzodiazepines, shares an almost identical pharmacological profile as benzodiazepines, including anxiolytic properties. Its mechanism of action is by binding to the benzodiazepine site and acting as a [[full agonist]], which in turn positively modulates benzodiazepine-sensitive GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and enhances GABA binding at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors to produce zopiclone's pharmacological properties.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Blanchard JC |author2=Julou L.  |date=March 1983 | title = Suriclone: a new cyclopyrrolone derivative recognizing receptors labeled by benzodiazepines in rat hippocampus and cerebellum | journal = Journal of Neurochemistry | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 601–607 | pmid = 6298365  | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-4159.1983.tb08023.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|pmid=6135616|date=May 1983|author1=Skerritt, Jh |author2=Johnston, Ga |title=Enhancement of GABA binding by benzodiazepines and related anxiolytics.|volume=89|issue=3-4|pages=193–198|issn=0014-2999|journal=European Journal of Pharmacology|url=|doi=10.1016/0014-2999(83)90494-6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=2905900 |date=September 1988 |author1=De, Deyn, Pp |author2=Macdonald, Rl |title=Effects of non-sedative anxiolytic drugs on responses to GABA and on diazepam-induced enhancement of these responses on mouse neurones in cell culture |volume=95 |issue=1 |pages=109–120 |issn=0007-1188 |pmc=1854132 |journal=[[British Journal of Pharmacology]] |doi=10.1111/j.1476-5381.1988.tb16554.x}}</ref> In addition to zopiclone's benzodiazepine pharmacological properties, it also has some [[barbiturate]]-like properties.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Julou L |author2=Bardone MC |author3=Blanchard JC |author4=Garret C |author5=Stutzmann JM.  | year = 1983 | title = Pharmacological studies on zopiclone | journal = Pharmacology | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 46–58 | pmid = 6142468| doi = 10.1159/000137911 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Blanchard JC |author2=Boireau A |author3=Julou L.  | year = 1983 | title = Brain receptors and zopiclone | journal = Pharmacology | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 59–69 | pmid = 6322210| doi = 10.1159/000137912 }}</ref>

In [[EEG]] studies, zopiclone significantly increases the energy of the beta frequency band and shows characteristics of high-voltage slow waves, desynchronization of hippocampal theta waves, and an increase in the energy of the delta frequency band. Zopiclone increases both stage 2 and slow-wave sleep (SWS), while zolpidem, an α1-selective compound, increases only SWS and causes no effect on stage 2 sleep. Zopiclone is less selective to the α1 site and has higher affinity to the α2 site than zaleplon. Zopiclone is therefore very similar pharmacologically to benzodiazepines.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Noguchi H |author2=Kitazumi K |author3=Mori M |author4=Shiba T.  |date=March 2004 | title = Electroencephalographic properties of zaleplon, a non-benzodiazepine sedative/hypnotic, in rats | journal = J Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 94 | issue = 3 |pages = 246–251 | pmid = 15037809 | url = http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jphs/94/3/246/_pdf | format = PDF  | doi = 10.1254/jphs.94.246 }}</ref>

==Pharmacokinetics==
[[Image:Zopiclone metabolism.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.65|alt=Two major zopiclone metabolites.|Two major zopiclone metabolites.]]{{clear left}}
After oral administration, zopiclone is rapidly absorbed, with a bioavailability around 75–80%. Time to peak plasma concentration is 1–2 hours. High-fat meal preceding zopiclone administration does not change absorption (as measured by [[Area under the curve (pharmacokinetics)|AUC]]), but reduces peak plasma levels and delays its occurrence, thus may delay the onset of therapeutic effects.

The plasma protein-binding of zopiclone has been reported to be weak, between 45 and 80% (mean 52–59%). It is rapidly and widely distributed to body tissues, including the brain, and is excreted in urine, saliva, and [[breast milk]]. Zopiclone is partly extensively metabolized in the liver to form an active ''N''-demethylated derivative (''N''-desmethylzopiclone) and an inactive zopiclone-''N''-oxide. Hepatic enzymes playing the most significant role in zopiclone metabolism are [[CYP3A4]] and [[CYP2E1]]. In addition, about 50% of the administered dose is decarboxylated and excreted via the lungs. In urine, the ''N''-demethyl and ''N''-oxide metabolites account for 30% of the initial dose. Between 7 and 10% of zopiclone is recovered from the urine, indicating extensive metabolism of the drug before excretion. The terminal elimination half-life of zopiclone ranges from 3.5 to 6.5 hours (5 hours on average).<ref name = "Assessment" />

The [[pharmacokinetics]] of zopiclone in humans are [[Stereoselectivity|stereoselective]]. After oral administration of the [[racemic mixture]], C<sub>max</sub> (time to maximum plasma concentration), area under the plasma time-concentration curve ([[Area under the curve (pharmacokinetics)|AUC]]) and [[Biological half-life|terminal elimination half-life]] values are higher for the [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|dextrorotatory]] [[enantiomer]]s, owing to the slower total clearance and smaller [[volume of distribution]] (corrected by the bioavailability), compared with the levorotatory enantiomer. In urine, the concentrations of the dextrorotatory enantiomers of the ''N''-demethyl and ''N''-oxide metabolites are higher than those of the respective [[Antipode (chemistry)|antipodes]].

==History==
Zopiclone was developed and first introduced in 1986 by [[Rhône-Poulenc]] S.A., now part of [[Sanofi-Aventis]], the main worldwide manufacturer. Initially, it was promoted as an improvement on benzodiazepines, but a recent meta-analysis found it was no better than benzodiazepines in any of the aspects assessed.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Holbrook AM, Crowther R, Lotter A, Cheng C, King D |title=Meta-analysis of benzodiazepine use in the treatment of insomnia |journal=CMAJ |volume=162 |issue=2 |pages=225–233 |date=January 2000 |pmid=10674059 |pmc=1232276 |doi= }}</ref> On April 4, 2005, the U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] listed zopiclone under [[Controlled Substances Act|schedule IV]], due to evidence that the drug has [[Drug addiction|addictive]] properties similar to benzodiazepines.

Zopiclone, as traditionally sold worldwide, is a [[racemic]] mixture of two [[stereoisomer]]s, only one of which is active.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=8398600 |url= |year=1993 |author1=Blaschke, G |author2=Hempel, G |author3=Müller, We |title=Preparative and analytical separation of the zopiclone enantiomers and determination of their affinity to the benzodiazepine receptor binding site |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=419–421 |issn=0899-0042 |doi=10.1002/chir.530050605|journal=Chirality }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=7905394 |url= |date=November 1993 |author1=Fernandez, C |author2=Maradeix, V |author3=Gimenez, F |author4=Thuillier, A |author5=Farinotti, R |title=Pharmacokinetics of zopiclone and its enantiomers in Caucasian young healthy volunteers |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=1125–1128 |issn=0090-9556 |journal=Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals }}</ref> In 2005, the pharmaceutical company [[Sepracor]] of [[Marlborough, Massachusetts]] began marketing the active stereoisomer [[eszopiclone]] under the name Lunesta in the United States. This had the consequence of placing what is a [[generic drug]] in most of the world under patent control in the United States. Although it was expected to be available in generic form by 2010, no generic has become available there at present.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insomnia.emedtv.com/lunesta/generic-lunesta.html |title=Generic Lunesta |publisher=Insomnia.emedtv.com |accessdate=2013-06-06}}</ref>{{Update after|2013|01|31}} However, zopiclone is currently available off-patent in a number of European countries, as well as [[Brazil]], Canada, and Hong Kong. The eszopiclone/zopiclone difference is in the dosage&mdash;the strongest eszopiclone derivative dosage contains 3&nbsp;mg of the therapeutic stereoisomer, whereas the highest zopiclone dosage (7.5&nbsp;mg) contains 3.75&nbsp;mg of the active stereoisomer. The two agents have not yet been studied in head-to-head clinical trials to determine the existence of any potential clinical differences (efficacy, side effects, developing dependence on the drug, safety, etc.).

==Recreational use==
Zopiclone has the potential for misuse and dosage escalation, drug abuse, and drug dependence. It is abused orally and sometimes intravenously, and often combined with alcohol to achieve a combined sedative hypnotic—alcohol euphoria. Patients abusing the drug are also at risk of dependence. Withdrawal symptoms can be seen after long-term use of normal doses even after a gradual reduction regimen. The Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties recommends zopiclone prescriptions not exceed 7 to 10 days, owing to concerns of addiction, tolerance, and physical dependence.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cimolai N |title=Zopiclone: is it a pharmacologic agent for abuse? |journal=Can Fam Physician |volume=53 |issue=12 |pages=2124–2129 |date=December 2007 |pmid=18077750 |pmc=2231551 |doi= }}</ref> Two types of drug misuse can occur: either recreational misuse, wherein the drug is taken to achieve a high, or when the drug is continued long-term against medical advice.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Griffiths RR, Johnson MW |title=Relative abuse liability of hypnotic drugs: a conceptual framework and algorithm for differentiating among compounds |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=66 Suppl 9 |issue= |pages=31–41 |year=2005 |pmid=16336040 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hoffmann F, Pfannkuche M, Glaeske G |title=[High usage of zolpidem and zopiclone.

==Detection in biological fluids==
Zopiclone may be measured in blood, plasma, or urine by chromatographic methods. Plasma concentrations are typically less than 100 μg/l during therapeutic use, but frequently exceed 100 μg/l in automotive vehicle operators arrested for impaired driving ability and may exceed 1000 μg/l in acutely poisoned patients. ''Post mortem'' blood concentrations are usually in a range of 0.4-3.9&nbsp;mg/l in victims of fatal acute overdose.<ref>Kratzsch C, Tenberken O, Peters FT et al.
