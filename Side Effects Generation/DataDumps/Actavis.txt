==History==
The company was founded in the spring of 1983,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/q/pr?s=ACT+Profile|title=ACT Profile - Actavis plc Ordinary Shares Stock - Yahoo! Finance|work=yahoo.com}}</ref> when, with funding from friends and family, colleagues [[Allen Chao, Ph.D.]] and David Hsia, Ph.D., began a small drug development enterprise. Just two months later, the founders established an initial product development and analytical laboratory with six employees (including both founders) in a leased space in [[Libertyville, Illinois]].

By late fall of the same year, the company moved to [[Southern California]] into an initial 2,000-square-foot (190 m2) leased facility in [[Corona]], and the development and manufacturing of generic pharmaceuticals began.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tbiweb.org/tbi/newsevents.php?news_id=28&pid=6 |work=TBI |title=Watson Pharmaceuticals acquired Arrow Group for 1.75B |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402194755/http://www.tbiweb.org/tbi/newsevents.php?news_id=28&pid=6 |archivedate=2015-04-02 }}</ref> The Corona site became the corporate headquarters for the rapidly expanding U.S. company.

==Company evolution==
===The 1990s===
Throughout its history, Actavis has expanded both organically and as the result of strategic acquisitions. In 1993, Actavis, then Watson, announced its initial public offering (IPO) of shares of common stock. The company was initially listed on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol WATS. The company moved to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 1997, and began trading under the symbol WPI.
