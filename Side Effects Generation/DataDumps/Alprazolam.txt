==Medical uses==
Alprazolam is mostly used to treat [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[panic disorder]]s, and [[nausea]] due to [[chemotherapy]].<ref name=AHFS/> Alprazolam may also be indicated for the treatment of [[generalized anxiety disorder]], as well as for the treatment of anxiety conditions with [[co-morbid]] depression.<ref name="xcppdmm" /> The FDA label advises that the physician should periodically reassess the usefulness of the drug.<ref name=fdalabel082011/> 

===Panic disorder===
Alprazolam is effective in the relief of moderate to severe [[anxiety]] and [[panic attacks]].<ref name=fdalabel082011/> However, it is not a first line treatment since the development of [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]].

[[Ethanol|Alcohol]] is one of the most common interactions; alcohol and alprazolam taken in combination have a [[synergistic]] effect on one another, which can cause severe sedation, behavioral changes, and intoxication.

{{main article|Benzodiazepine overdose}}

Overdoses of alprazolam can be mild to severe depending on how much of it taken and other drugs that have been taken.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1=Isbister | first1=G. K. | last2=O'Regan | first2=L. | last3=Sibbritt | first3=D. | last4=Whyte | first4=I.

Alprazolam overdoses cause excess [[central nervous system]] (CNS) depression and may include one or more of the following symptoms:<ref name=ase/>
* Coma and death if alprazolam is combined with other substances.
* [[Fainting]]
* [[Hypotension]] (low blood pressure)
* [[Hypoventilation]] (shallow breathing)
* Impaired [[motor functions]]
** [[Dizziness]]
** [[Balance disorder|Impaired balance]]
** Impaired or absent [[reflexes]]
** [[Muscle weakness]]
* [[Orthostatic hypotension]] (fainting while standing up too quickly)
* [[Somnolence]] (drowsiness)

===Dependence and withdrawal===
{{See also|Benzodiazepine dependence|Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome}}

Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, binds to specific sites on the GABA<sub>A</sub> ([[gamma-amino-butyric acid]]) receptor. When bound to these sites, which are referred to as benzodiazepine receptors, it modulates the effect of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and, thus, of GABAergic neurons. Long-term use causes adaptive changes in the benzodiazepine receptors, making them less sensitive to stimulation and thus making the drugs less potent.<ref name=Stahl>{{Cite book | last=Stahl | first=S. | title=Essential Pharmacology: Neuroscientific Basis and Practical Applications | year=1996 | isbn=0-521-42620-0 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}</ref>

[[Drug withdrawal|Withdrawal]] and [[rebound symptoms]] commonly occur and necessitate a gradual reduction in dosage to minimize withdrawal effects when discontinuing.<ref name=Verster2004/>

Not all withdrawal effects are evidence of true dependence or withdrawal. Recurrence of symptoms such as anxiety may simply indicate that the drug was having its expected anti-anxiety effect and that, in the absence of the drug, the symptom has returned to pretreatment levels. If the symptoms are more severe or frequent, the person may be experiencing a [[rebound effect]] due to the removal of the drug. Either of these can occur without the person actually being drug-dependent.<ref name="Stahl"/>

Alprazolam and other benzodiazepines may also cause the development of [[physical dependence]], [[drug tolerance|tolerance]], and [[benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms]] during rapid dose reduction or cessation of therapy after long-term treatment.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Juergens | first1=S.

Those taking more than 4&nbsp;mg per day have an increased potential for dependence.

In a 1983 study, only 5% of patients who had abruptly stopped taking long-acting benzodiazepines after less than 8 months demonstrated withdrawal symptoms, but 43% of those who had been taking them for more than 8 months did. With alprazolam&nbsp;– a short-acting benzodiazepine&nbsp;– taken for 8 weeks, 65% of patients experienced significant rebound anxiety.

The benzodiazepines [[diazepam]] (Valium) and [[oxazepam]] (Serepax) have been found to produce fewer withdrawal reactions than alprazolam (Xanax), [[temazepam]] (Restoril/Normison), or [[lorazepam]] (Temesta/Ativan). Factors that determine the risk of [[Substance dependence|psychological dependence]] or [[physical dependence]] and the severity of the [[benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms]] during dose reduction of alprazolam include: dosage used, length of use, frequency of dosing, personality characteristics of the individual, previous use of cross-dependent/cross-tolerant drugs (alcohol or other sedative-hypnotic drugs), current use of cross-dependent/-tolerant drugs, use of other short-acting, high-potency benzodiazepines,<ref name="wolf1991">{{cite journal | last1=Wolf | first1=B. | last2=Griffiths | first2=R.

==Detection in body fluids==
Alprazolam may be quantified in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients, provide evidence in an impaired driving arrest, or to assist in a [[Medical jurisprudence|medicolegal]] death investigation. Blood or plasma alprazolam concentrations are usually in a range of 10–100 μg/L in persons receiving the drug therapeutically, 100–300 μg/L in those arrested for impaired driving, and 300–2000 μg/L in victims of acute overdosage. Most commercial [[immunoassays]] for the benzodiazepine class of drugs cross-react with alprazolam, but confirmation and quantitation is usually performed using [[chromatographic]] techniques.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Jones | first=A.

As a benzodiazepine, alprazolam produces a variety of therapeutic and adverse effects by binding to the benzodiazepine receptor site on the [[GABA A receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub>]] receptor and modulating its function; [[GABA receptor]]<nowiki/>s are the most prolific inhibitory receptor within the brain. The GABA chemical and receptor system mediates inhibitory or calming effects of alprazolam on the nervous system. The GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor is made up of 5 subunits out of a possible 19, and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors made up of different combinations of subunits have different properties, different locations within the brain, and, importantly, different activities with regard to benzodiazepines. Alprazolam and other triazolobenzodiazepines like [[triazolam]] that have a triazol ring attached to their structure appear to have [[antidepressant]] properties, since the structure resembles that of [[Tricyclic antidepressant|tricyclic antidepressants]], which also have rings.<ref name=Barbee95>{{cite journal | last1=Barbee | first1=J.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Alprazolam is taken orally, and is absorbed well – 80% of alprazolam binds to [[Blood proteins|proteins in the serum]] (the majority binding to [[albumin]]). The concentration of alprazolam peaks after one to two hours.<ref name=xcppdmm />

Alprazolam is metabolized in the liver, mostly by the enzyme [[CYP3A4|cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4)]]. Two major metabolites are produced: 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam, as well as an inactive [[benzophenone]]. The low concentrations and low potencies of 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam indicate that they have little to no contribution to the effects of alprazolam.<ref name=xcppdmm />

The metabolites, as well as some unmetabolized alprazolam, are filtered out by the kidneys and are excreted in the urine.<ref name=xcppdmm />

==Forms of alprazolam==
Alprazolam regular release and orally disintegrating tablets are available as 0.25&nbsp;mg, 0.5&nbsp;mg, 1&nbsp;mg, and 2&nbsp;mg tablets,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rxwiki.com/alprazolam#forms_of_medication | title=Alprazolam Dosage, Uses, Overdose Info and More | date=18 November 2013 | publisher=RXwiki.com | accessdate=22 January 2014}}{{unreliable source?|date=January 2014}} {{plays audio}}</ref> while extended release tablets are available as 0.5&nbsp;mg, 1&nbsp;mg, 2&nbsp;mg, and 3&nbsp;mg.

===Recreational use===
{{See also|Benzodiazepine misuse}}
There is a risk of misuse and dependence in both patients and non-medical users of alprazolam; alprazolam's high affinity binding, high potency, and rapid onset increase its abuse potential. The physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome of alprazolam also add to its addictive nature. In the small subgroup of individuals who escalate their doses there is usually a history of alcohol or other substance use disorders.<ref name="moylan2012"/> Despite this, most prescribed alprazolam users do not use their medication recreationally, and the long-term use of benzodiazepines does not generally correlate with the need for dose escalation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Soumerai | first1=S.

Alprazolam, along with other benzodiazepines, is often used with other recreational drugs. These uses include aids to relieve the panic or distress of [[Dysphoria|dysphoric]] ("[[bad trip]]") reactions to [[psychedelic drugs]], such as [[LSD]], and the drug-induced [[psychomotor agitation|agitation]] and [[insomnia]] in the "[[Comedown (drugs)|comedown]]" stages of [[stimulant]] use, such as [[amphetamine]], [[cocaine]], and [[MDMA]] allowing sleep. Alprazolam may also be used with other [[depressant|depressant drugs]], such as [[ethanol]], [[heroin]] and other [[opioid]]s, in an attempt to enhance their psychological effects. Alprazolam may be used in conjunction with [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], with users citing a synergistic effect achieved after consuming the combination.

The [[poly-drug use]] of powerful depressant drugs poses the highest level of health concerns due to a significant increase in the likelihood of experiencing an [[drug overdose|overdose]], which may cause fatal [[respiratory depression]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Walker | first1=B.
