'''Turoctocog alfa''' (trade name '''NovoEight''') is a recombinant [[antihemophilic factor|antihemophilic]] [[factor VIII]] used for the treatment of and prophylaxis of bleeding patients with [[haemophilia A]]. It is marketed by [[Novo Nordisk]].<ref>NovoEight {{Drugs.com|UK|novoeight}}</ref><ref name="Spreitzer">{{cite journal| author = H. Spreitzer| date = 7 January 2014| title = Neue Wirkstoffe – NovoEight| journal = Österreichische Apothekerzeitung| issue = 1/2014| page = 18| language = German}}</ref> It was first launched in Germany in January 2014 and has been approved in the US, EU and Japan.<ref>Novo Nordisk annual report 2013</ref>

==Medical uses==
In the safety and efficacy trial for prevention and treatment of bleeds, in hemophilia patients the success rate for treatment of bleeds was 84.5% (excluding bleeds for which there was no outcome reported) and out of a total of nine surgeries in nine patients performed during the trial, haemostasis was successful in all the surgeries and no treatment failures were reported. It is also used for perioperative management and routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes. Turoctocog alfa is not indicated for the treatment of [[von Willebrand disease]].<ref name="FDA Approval Document">{{cite web|title=FDA Approval Document|accessdate=2014-04-27|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/biologicsbloodvaccines/bloodbloodproducts/approvedproducts/licensedproductsblas/fractionatedplasmaproducts/ucm371094.pdf}}</ref>

==Benefits and risks==
In a study conducted with 150 patients aged 12 and above, adolescents after using turoctocog alfa as a treatment, had an average of 5.55 bleedings per year while the adults had an average of 6.68 bleeding per year. According to data, turoctocog alfa was considered an 'excellent' treatment for 403 out of 499 bleeding episodes.
In another study involving 63 patients aged less than 12 years, children had an average of 5.33 bleedings per year after using turoctocog alfa as hemophilia treatment. In this study too turoctocog alfa was considered as an 'excellent' treatment for 116 out of 126 bleeding episodes.<ref>{{cite web|title=European Drug Assessment Report|accessdate=2014-04-27|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Summary_for_the_public/human/002719/WC500157556.pdf}}</ref>

Alongside the benefits, a few of the common turoctocog alfa adverse effects would be injection site reaction, [[pyrexia]] and augmented liver enzyme levels. Rare cases of allergic reactions have been reported as well. There is a possibility of patients developing hypersensitivity to the drug since it contains traces of hamster proteins. Activity-neutralising antibodies may be developed whereby expected plasma factor VIII activity levels may not be achieved and thus the bleeding would not be controlled as needed.<ref name="FDA Approval Document"/>

==Preparation==
As cell culture, [[Chinese hamster ovary cell]]s (CHO) are used in order to acquire proper processing of factor VIII protein, that has demonstrated good efficacy in [[thrombin]] generation and clot formation in preclinical evaluations in murine (mouse) and canine (dog) models of hemophilia A and in patient-derived whole blood.<ref>{{cite web|author=Haddley K.|title=Turoctog alfa for the treatment of hemophilia A|publisher=Drugs today|accessdate=2014-04-07|url=http://0-www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.elis.tmu.edu.tw/pubmed/24619589}}</ref>

==Difference between NovoSeven and NovoEight==
Even though both treatments are plasma-derived and recombinant analogues of blood clotting factors, [[NovoSeven]] is developed as a congenital FVIIa analogue for hemophilia A and B patients while NovoEight (turoctocog alfa) is for congenital FVIII deficiency. NovoSeven is called a bypassing agent because it skips the need for factor VIII or IX in people with inhibitors and activates [[factor X]] directly.<ref>{{cite web|title=How NovoSeven Works|accessdate=2014-04-27|url=https://www.novosevenrt.com/hemophilia-bleed-control/how-works.html}}</ref>
