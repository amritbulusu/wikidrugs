The most important side effect is an increase in [[seizure threshold|risk for epileptic seizures]], which caused the drug to be withdrawn from the market for some time and then caused the recommended dosage to be reduced.<ref name="pmid16027765" /> In comparison to many other antidepressants, it does not cause as much [[weight gain]], [[sexual dysfunction]], or [[sleepiness]].<ref name="pmid16027765" /> Bupropion acts as an [[Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors|norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor]] (NDRI).

<!-- History and culture -->
Bupropion was first made by [[Nariman Mehta]] and patented by Burroughs Wellcome in 1969, which later became part of what is now [[GlaxoSmithKline]]. It was first approved for medical use in the United States in 1989. It was originally called by the generic name amfebutamone, before being renamed in 2000.<ref>The INN originally assigned in 1974 by the [[World Health Organization]] was "amfebutamone". In 2000, the INN was reassigned as ''bupropion''. See {{cite journal | author = [[World Health Organization]] | title = International Nonproprietary Names for Pharmaceutical Substances (INN).

A typical bupropion treatment course lasts up to twelve weeks, with the people halting the use of tobacco about ten days into the course. Bupropion approximately doubles the chance of quitting smoking successfully.<ref name=pmid17156479/> The effectiveness of bupropion is comparable to [[nicotine replacement therapy]], but less effective than [[varenicline]].<ref name=pmid17156479/>{{update inline|date=February 2017}}

Animal studies indicate that administration of bupropion at less than the recommended therapeutic dose may actually enhance the rewarding properties of nicotine, i.e., low doses augment nicotine self-administration and high doses attenuate it.<ref name=Dwoskin/>

In Australia and the UK smoking cessation is the only licensed use of bupropion.<ref name = AMH/><ref name = BNF/>

==Contraindications==
The drug label advises that bupropion should not be prescribed to individuals with [[epilepsy]] or other conditions that lower the [[seizure threshold]], such as [[anorexia nervosa]], [[bulimia nervosa]], active brain tumors, or concurrent alcohol and/or [[benzodiazepine]] use and/or withdrawal. It should be avoided in individuals who are also taking [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAOIs). When switching from MAOIs to bupropion, it is important to include a washout period of about two weeks between the medications.<ref name=BupropionLabel/> The label recommends that caution should be exercised when treating people with liver damage, severe [[nephropathy|kidney disease]], and severe [[hypertension]], and in children, adolescents and young adults due to the increased risk of [[suicidal ideation]].<ref name=BupropionLabel>FDA [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/018644s048,020358s055lbl.pdf Buproprion Label] Last revised December 16, 2014 as described on the  [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.Set_Current_Drug&ApplNo=018644&DrugName=WELLBUTRIN&ActiveIngred=BUPROPION%20HYDROCHLORIDE&SponsorApplicant=GLAXOSMITHKLINE&ProductMktStatus=1&goto=Search.Label_ApprovalHistory FDA Label Website].

==Side effects==
{{See also|List of side effects of bupropion}}

[[Epileptic seizure]]s are the most important adverse effect of bupropion. A high incidence of seizures was responsible for the temporary withdrawal of the drug from the market between 1986 and 1989. The risk of seizure is strongly dose-dependent, but also dependent on the preparation. The sustained-release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0.1% at daily dosages of less than 300&nbsp;mg of bupropion and 0.4% at 300–400&nbsp;mg.<ref name=Hales>{{cite book | name-list-format = vanc |editors=Hales E, Yudofsky JA |title=The American Psychiatric Press Textbook of Psychiatry |location=Washington, DC |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. |year=2003}}</ref> The immediate release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0.4% for dosages below 450&nbsp;mg; the incidence climbs to 5% for dosages between 450–600&nbsp;mg per day.<ref name=Hales/> For comparison, the incidence of unprovoked seizure in the general population is 0.07 to 0.09%, and the risk of seizure for a variety of other antidepressants is generally between 0.1 and 1.5% at recommended dosage levels.<ref name="pmid11888352">{{cite journal |vauthors=Pisani F, Oteri G, Costa C, Di Raimondo G, Di Perri R | title = Effects of psychotropic drugs on seizure threshold | journal = Drug Saf | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 91–110 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11888352 | doi = 10.2165/00002018-200225020-00004 }}</ref> Clinical depression itself has been reported to increase the occurrence of seizures, and a study examining FDA clinical trial data has suggested that in most cases, low to moderate doses of antidepressants may not actually increase seizure risk at all.<ref name="pmid17223086">{{cite journal |vauthors=Alper K, Schwartz KA, Kolts RL, Khan A | title = Seizure incidence in psychopharmacological clinical trials: an analysis of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) summary basis of approval reports | journal = Biol.

The frequency of this adverse effect was under 1% and not significantly higher than found with placebo.<ref name=BupropionLabel/> A review of the available data carried out in 2008 indicated that bupropion is safe to use in people with a variety of serious cardiac conditions.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Taylor D | title = Antidepressant drugs and cardiovascular pathology: a clinical overview of effectiveness and safety | journal = Acta Psychiatr Scand | volume = 118 | issue = 6 | pages = 434–42 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 18785947 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2008.01260.x }}</ref>

In the UK, more than 7,600 reports of suspected adverse reactions were collected in the first two years after bupropion's approval by the [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] as part of the [[Yellow Card Scheme]], which monitored side effects. Approximately 540,000 people were treated with bupropion for smoking cessation during that period. The MHRA received 60 reports of "''suspected'' [emphasis MHRA's] adverse reactions to Zyban which had a fatal outcome".

===Psychiatric===
Suicidal thoughts and behaviors are rare in clinical trials, and the FDA requires all antidepressants, including bupropion, to carry a [[boxed warning]] stating that antidepressants may increase the risk of suicide in persons younger than 25. This warning is based on a statistical analysis conducted by the FDA which found a 2-fold increase in [[suicidal ideation|suicidal thought]] and behavior in children and adolescents, and 1.5-fold increase in the 18–24 age group.<ref name=FDA>{{cite web |vauthors=Levenson M, Holland C | title =Antidepressants and suicidality in adults: statistical evaluation.

In 2009 the FDA issued a health advisory warning that the prescription of bupropion for smoking cessation has been associated with reports about unusual behavior changes, agitation and hostility.

==Interactions==
Since bupropion is metabolized to [[hydroxybupropion]] by the [[CYP2B6]] enzyme, drug interactions with CYP2B6 inhibitors are possible: this includes medications like paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, [[diazepam]], [[clopidogrel]], and [[orphenadrine]]. The expected result is the increase of bupropion and decrease of hydroxybupropion blood concentration. The reverse effect (decrease of bupropion and increase of hydroxybupropion) can be expected with CYP2B6 [[enzyme induction and inhibition|inducers]], such as [[carbamazepine]], [[clotrimazole]], [[rifampicin]], [[ritonavir]], [[Hypericum perforatum|St John's wort]], [[phenobarbital]], [[phenytoin]] and others.<ref name="pmid16368442">{{cite journal |vauthors=Jefferson JW, Pradko JF, Muir KT | title = Bupropion for major depressive disorder: Pharmacokinetic and formulation considerations | journal = Clin Ther | volume = 27 | issue = 11 | pages = 1685–95 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16368442 | doi = 10.1016/j.clinthera.2005.11.011 }}</ref> Conversely, because bupropion is itself a strong inhibitor of [[CYP2D6]] ([[Dissociation constant|K<sub>i</sub>]] = 21&nbsp;μM),<ref name = EMCsustained/><ref name=Dwoskin/> as is its active metabolite, hydroxybupropion (K<sub>i</sub> = 13.3&nbsp;μM), it can slow the clearance of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme.<ref name = EMCsustained/><ref name = PREXATON/><ref name=BupropionLabel/><ref name="pmid16368442"/> As an example, the ratio of [[dextromethorphan]] (a drug that is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6) to its major [[metabolite]] [[dextrorphan]] increased approximately 35-fold when it was administered to people being treated with 300&nbsp;mg/day bupropion, indicative of a major drug interaction with a common [[over-the-counter]] medicine.<ref name="pmid16368442" />

===Pharmacokinetics===
[[File:Bupropion metabolism.png|thumb|upright=1.7|[[Drug metabolism|Phase I Metabolism]] of racemic bupropion. The carbonyl reductase enzyme that is responsible for producing ''erythro''-bupropion is unknown as of March 2015.]]
Bupropion is metabolized in the liver by the [[cytochrome P450]] isoenzyme [[CYP2B6]].<ref name=Hales/> It has several active metabolites: ''R,R''-hydroxybupropion, ''S,S''-hydroxybupropion, ''threo''-hydrobupropion and ''erythro''-hydrobupropion, which are further metabolized to inactive metabolites and eliminated through excretion into the urine. Both bupropion and its primary metabolite hydroxybupropion act in the liver as potent inhibitors of the enzyme [[CYP2D6]], which metabolizes not only bupropion itself but also a variety of other drugs and biologically active substances.<ref name=Dwoskin/> This mechanism creates the potential for a variety of drug interactions.

The biological activity of bupropion can be attributed to a significant degree to its active metabolites, in particular to ''S,S''-hydroxybupropion. GlaxoSmithKline developed this metabolite as a separate drug called [[radafaxine]],<ref>{{cite press release | url = http://www.biospace.com/news_story.aspx?StoryID=18222420&full=1 | title = GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Reviews Novel Therapeutics For CNS Disorders And Confirms Strong Pipeline Momentum | date = 23 November 2004 | accessdate = 18 August 2007 | publisher = PRNewswire}}</ref> but discontinued development in 2006 due to "an unfavourable risk/benefit assessment".<ref>GlaxoSmithKline (26 July 2006) {{cite web|url=http://www.gsk.com/investors/reports/gsk_q22006/q22006.pdf |title=''Pipeline Update'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927173339/http://www.gsk.com/investors/reports/gsk_q22006/q22006.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }} &nbsp;{{small|(136&nbsp;KB)}}.

In April 2008, the FDA approved a formulation of bupropion as a hydrobromide salt instead of a hydrochloride salt, to be sold under the name Aplenzin by [[Sanofi|Sanofi-Aventis]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/574187 |title=FDA Approvals: Advair, Relistor, Aplenzin |accessdate=9 May 2008 |author=Waknine, Yael |date=8 May 2008 |publisher=[[Medscape]]}}</ref>

In 2012, the U.S. Justice Department announced that GlaxoSmithKline had agreed to plead guilty and pay a $3-billion fine, in part for promoting the unapproved use of Wellbutrin for weight loss and sexual dysfunction.<ref>{{cite news|title=Glaxo agrees to pay $3 billion in fraud settlement |newspaper=The New York Times|date=2 July 2012|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/03/business/glaxosmithkline-agrees-to-pay-3-billion-in-fraud-settlement.html |vauthors=Thomas K, Schmidt MS }}</ref>
