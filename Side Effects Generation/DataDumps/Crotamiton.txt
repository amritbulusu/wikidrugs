'''Crotamiton''' is a drug that is used both as a scabicidal (for treating [[scabies]]) and as a general [[antipruritic]] (anti-itching drug). It is a prescription lotion based medicine that is applied to the whole body to get rid of the scabies [[parasite]] that burrows under the [[skin]] and causes [[itching]].

==Use==
For treating scabies, crotamiton should be applied to the whole body rather than a localized area. It is applied two or three times, with a 24-hour delay in between applications, and the patient is asked to take a [[shower]] no sooner than after 48 hours. For children under 3 years, it is applied once daily.  It can also be used to treat itching stemming from other causes, e.g. insect bites, in which case it is applied to the itching areas only, and repeated if necessary after 4 to 8 hours.  Use near the eyes, or breaks in the skin, should be avoided.

==Pharmacology==
The mechanism of action of crotamiton is unknown, however it is toxic to the scabies mite.<ref>[http://www.medscape.com/druginfo/monograph?cid=med&drugid=6258&drugname=Crotamiton+Top&monotype=monograph&secid=6 Medscape drug information - mechanism of action]</ref>

==Pharmacokinetics==
After topical application, crotamiton is absorbed systemically. It has an elimination half-life of 30.9 hours and 4.8-8.8% is excreted in the urine.<ref>[http://www.medscape.com/druginfo/monograph?cid=med&drugid=6258&drugname=Crotamiton+Top&monotype=monograph&secid=7 Medscape drug information - pharmacokinetics]</ref>

==Side effects==
The most common [[Adverse effect|side effect]] of crotamiton is skin [[irritation]].

==Trade name==
Crotamiton is marketed under the [[trade name]]s Eurax, which is manufactured by Ranbaxy Laboratories in the USA, and GlaxoSmithKline in the UK, and Euracin, which is manufactured by Green Cross in South Korea.  In Germany, it is marketed under the brand name, Crotamitex.
In India,  it is sold as Eurax by [[Ranbaxy Laboratories]]
