'''Acivicin''' is an analog of [[glutamine]]. It is an [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] of [[gamma-glutamyl transferase]]. 

It is a [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] product of ''[[Streptomyces sviceus]]''.<ref name=Allen>{{ cite journal | last1 = Allen | first1 = L. | last2 = Meck | first2 = R. | last3 = Yunis | first3 = A. | title = The Inhibition of γ-Glutamyl Transpeptidase from Human Pancreatic Carcinoma Cells by (αS,5S)-α-Amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazoleacetic Acid (AT-125; NSC-163501) | journal = Research Communications in Chemical Pathology and Pharmacology| year = 1980 | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 175–182

After its discovery in 1972, acivicin was studied as an anti-cancer agent, but trials were unsuccessful due to toxicity.<ref>http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2015/sc/c4sc02339k</ref>

==Research==
An in vitro study showed that Acivicin at a concentration of 5 µM Acivicin inhibited by 78% the growth of human [[pancreatic]] [[carcinoma]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] (MIA PaCa-2) after 72 hours in continuous culture. It was also found that acivicin at a concentration of 450 µM irreversibly inactivated MIA PaCa-2 γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (10 nmol/min/10<sup>6</sup> cells) with an inactivation half-life of 80 minutes.<ref name=Allen/>

===Phase I studies===
Phase I dose escalating studies conducted in 23 cancer patients administered acivicin with a concomitant 96-h i.v. infusion of a mixture of 16 amino acids showed reversible, dose-limiting CNS toxicity, characterized  by lethargy, confusion and decreased mental status.
