'''Levomepromazine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]], [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]), also known as '''methotrimeprazine''', is a [[phenothiazine]] [[neuroleptic]] [[medication|drug]]. It is sold in many countries under the generic name (levomepromazine) or under brand names such as Nozinan, Levoprome, Detenler, Hirnamin, Levotomin, Neurocil and many more. It is a low-potency antipsychotic (approximately half as potent as [[chlorpromazine]]) with strong [[analgesic]], [[hypnotic]] and [[antiemetic]] properties that is primarily used in [[palliative care]].<ref name = MD>{{cite web|title=Levomepromazine|work=Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference|publisher=Pharmaceutical Press|location=London, UK|date=13 December 2013|accessdate=12 May 2014|url=http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/martindale/current/ms-7068-r.htm|editor=Brayfield, A}}</ref><ref name = BNF/>

Serious side effects include [[tardive dyskinesia]], [[akathisia]], [[QT interval|abnormalities in the electrical cycle of the heart]], [[hypotension|low blood pressure]] and the potentially fatal [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]].<ref name = MD/><ref name = BNF/>

As is typical of phenothiazine antipsychotics, levomepromazine is a "[[dirty drug]]", that is, it exerts its effects by [[receptor antagonist|blocking]] a variety of [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s, including [[adrenergic receptor]]s, [[dopamine receptor]]s, [[histamine receptor]]s, [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor]]s and [[serotonin receptor]]s.<ref name = MD/><ref name = BNF/>

==Medical uses==
It can be used as an analgesic for moderate to severe pain in non-[[ambulant]] patients (the latter being because of its strong sedative effects).<ref name="FTK">{{cite web|url=https://www.farmacotherapeutischkompas.nl/bladeren-volgens-boek/preparaatteksten/l/levomepromazine|title=Levomepromazine|website=Farmacotherapeutisch Kompas|access-date=5 October 2016|language=nl}}</ref>

Levomepromazine is also used at lower doses for the treatment of [[nausea]] and [[insomnia]].<ref name = MD/>

Levomepromazine is frequently prescribed and valued worldwide in palliative care medicine for its multimodal action, to treat intractable nausea or vomiting, and for severe delirium/agitation in the last days of life. Palliative care physicians will commonly prescribe it orally or via subcutaneous syringe drivers in combination with opioid analgesics such as hydromorphone.<ref name = MD/><ref name = BNF/>

Levomepromazine is used for the treatment of [[psychosis]], particularly those of [[schizophrenia]], and [[mania|manic]] phases of [[bipolar disorder]]. It should only be used with caution in the treatment of [[clinical depression|agitated depression]]s, as it can cause [[akathisia]] as a side effect, which could worsen the agitation.<ref name = MD/><ref name="BNF">{{cite book | isbn = 978-0-85711-084-8 | title = British National Formulary (BNF) | last1 = Joint Formulary Committee | year = 2013 | publisher = Pharmaceutical Press | location = London, UK | edition = 65  | pages =  }}</ref>A 2010 [[systematic review]] compared the efficacy of levomepromazine with atypical antipsychotic drugs:

==Adverse effects==
The most common side effect is [[akathisia]].<ref name = BNF/> Levomepromazine has prominent [[sedative]] and [[anticholinergic]]/[[sympatholytic]] effects (dry mouth, [[hypotension]], [[sinus tachycardia]], night sweats) and may cause weight gain.<ref name = BNF/> These side effects normally preclude prescribing the drug in doses needed for full [[remission (medicine)|remission]] of schizophrenia, so it has to be combined with a more potent antipsychotic.<ref name = BNF/> In any case, blood pressure and [[EKG]] should be monitored regularly.<ref name = BNF/>

A rare but life-threatening side effect is [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] (NMS).<ref name = BNF/> The symptoms of NMS include muscle stiffness, convulsions and fever.<ref name = BNF/>
