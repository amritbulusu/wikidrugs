'''Doxylamine''' is a first-generation [[antihistamine]]. It can be used by itself as a short-term [[sedative]] and in combination with other drugs to provide night-time [[allergy]] and [[common cold|cold]] relief. Doxylamine is also used in combination with the analgesics [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) and [[codeine]] as an analgesic/calmative preparation, and is prescribed in combination with [[vitamin B6|vitamin B<sub>6</sub>]] ([[pyridoxine]]) to prevent [[morning sickness]] in [[pregnancy|pregnant]] women. Its [[fetal]] safety is "A" in ''Briggs’ Reference Guide to Foetal and Neonatal Risk''.<ref name="BriggsFreeman2008">{{cite book |last1=Briggs |first1=Gerald G.|last2=Freeman|first2=Roger K.|last3=Yaffe|first3=Sumner J.|title=Drugs in Pregnancy and Lactation: A Reference Guide to Fetal and Neonatal Risk |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YOEV2w3XTxsC |year=2008|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-7876-3|doi=10.1258/om.2009.090002}}</ref>

==Side effects==
Doxylamine succinate is a potent [[anticholinergic]] and has a [[adverse drug reaction|side-effect]] profile common to such drugs, including [[Xerostomia|dry mouth]], [[ataxia]], [[urinary retention]], drowsiness, memory problems, inability to concentrate, hallucinations, psychosis, and a marked increased sensitivity to external stimuli. Like many hypnotics, it should not be combined with other antihistamines,{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} such as cetirizine (Zyrtec) or diphenhydramine (Benadryl), as this combination can increase the risk of serious side effects. Using doxylamine over a long period of time is not recommended. However, the drug is not addictive, and withdrawal effects are unlikely to be experienced with prolonged use.

Because of its relatively long [[elimination half-life]] (10–12&nbsp;hours), doxylamine is associated with daytime/next-day [[drowsiness]], [[grogginess]], [[dry mouth]], and [[tiredness]] when used as a [[hypnotic]].<ref name="Avidan2017">{{cite book|author=Alon Y.

* In [[Canada]]:
** doxylamine succinate and [[pyridoxine]] ([[vitamin B6|vitamin B<sub>6</sub>]]) are the ingredients of Diclectin, which is used to prevent [[morning sickness]].
** It is also available in combination with vitamin B<sub>6</sub> and [[folic acid]] under the brand name Evanorm (marketed by Ion Healthcare) {{where?|date=November 2015}}.
