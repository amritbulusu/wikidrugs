'''Epratuzumab''' (planned trade name '''LymphoCide''') is a [[humanized monoclonal antibody]].  Potential uses may be found in [[oncology]] and in treatment of [[inflammation|inflammatory]] [[autoimmune disorder]]s, such as [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] (SLE).<ref>[http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/full/9/10/3982S Epratuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting CD22: characterization of in vitro properties] Clinical Cancer Research Vol. 9,  September 1, 2003 ''free full text''</ref><ref>[http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/full/11/14/5215 Dose-Fractionated Radioimmunotherapy in Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Using DOTA-Conjugated, 90Y-Radiolabeled, Humanized Anti-CD22 Monoclonal Antibody, Epratuzumab] Clinical Cancer Research Vol. 11, July 15, 2005 ''free full text''</ref>

==Clinical trials==
A clinical trial for relapsed adult [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] (ALL) has reported initial results.<ref name=IMMU-Epra/>

Results have been published for a phase II trial in untreated [[follicular lymphoma]].<ref name=IMMU-Epra/>

Early results from a phase II trial for [[Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma]] (DLBCL) were encouraging.<ref name=IMMU-Epra/><ref name=Micallef2011>{{cite journal |url=http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/bloodjournal/118/15/4053.full.pdf |author= Micallef |title=Epratuzumab with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. |journal=Blood |volume=118 |issue=15 |pages=4053â€“61 |doi=10.1182/blood-2011-02-336990 |year=2011|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

July 28 2015]</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Epratuzumab binds to the glycoprotein [[CD22]] of mature and malignant [[B-cells]].

Elevated CD22 and other B-cell receptor (BCR) proteins are associated with SLE. "Epratuzumab's mechanism of action transfers these BCR proteins to [[T helper cell|helper cells called effector cell]]s which reduces B-cell destruction and epratuzumab's impact on the body's immune system"<ref name=SA201507/> via a process called [[trogocytosis]].<ref name=IMMU-Epra>[http://www.immunomedics.com/epratuzumab-demo.shtml Epratuzumab]</ref> (Other SLE therapies destroy B-cells which compromises the immune system.)
