It was developed by [[Shionogi]]. In 2013 Crestor was the fourth-highest selling drug in the United States, accounting for approx. $5.2 billion in sales.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 100 Drugs for Q2 2013 by Sales|url=http://www.drugs.com/stats/top100/sales|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref> A generic version became available in the United States in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=FDA approves first generic Crestor|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm498373.htm|website=FDA|accessdate=3 May 2016|date=April 29, 2016}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
The primary use of rosuvastatin is for the treatment of [[dyslipidemia]].<ref name=AHFS>{{cite web|title=Crestor|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/crestor.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref>

===Effects on cholesterol levels===
The effects of rosuvastatin on LDL cholesterol are dose-related. Higher doses were more efficacious in improving the lipid profile of patients with hypercholesterolemia than milligram-equivalent doses of atorvastatin and milligram-equivalent or higher doses of simvastatin and pravastatin.<ref name="Jones-2003">{{cite journal |vauthors=Jones PH, Davidson MH, Stein EA, Bays HE, McKenney JM, Miller E, Cain VA, Blasetto JW | title=Comparison of the efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin across doses (STELLAR Trial) | journal=Am J Cardiol | year=2003 | volume=92 | issue=2 | pages=152–60 | pmid=12860216 | doi=10.1016/S0002-9149(03)00530-7}}</ref>

==Structure==
Rosuvastatin has structural similarities with most other synthetic [[statin]]s, e.g., [[atorvastatin]], [[cerivastatin]] and [[pitavastatin]], but unlike other statins, rosuvastatin contains [[sulfur]] (in [[sulfonyl]] functional group).

Crestor is actually a [[calcium]] salt of rosuvastatin, i.e. rosuvastatin calcium,<ref name="FDAlabel"/> in which calcium replaces the hydrogen in the [[carboxylic acid]] group on the right of the skeletal formula at the top right of this page.

==Mechanism of action==
{{further|Statin}}

Rosuvastatin is a [[Competitive inhibition|competitive inhibitor]] of the enzyme [[HMG-CoA reductase]], having a mechanism of action similar to that of other statins.<!--

==Society and culture==

===Indications and regulation===
Rosuvastatin is approved in the United States for the treatment of high [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL cholesterol]] ([[dyslipidemia]]), total cholesterol ([[hypercholesterolemia]]), and/or [[triglyceride]]s ([[hypertriglyceridemia]]).<ref name="pill">{{cite web | title=Core Data Sheet, Crestor Tablets | url=http://www.crestor.info/gUserFiles/CRESTOR_CDS_10_40_mg_FINAL_170603.pdf | format=PDF | date=June 17, 2003 | publisher=AstraZeneca PLC | accessdate=2005-03-20}} - NOTE: this is provider-oriented information and should not be used without the supervision of a physician.</ref> In February 2010, rosuvastatin was approved by the FDA for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events.<ref name="fdaap">http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2010/021366s016ltr.pdf</ref>

As of 2004, rosuvastatin had been approved in 154 countries and launched in 56. Approval in the United States by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] came on August 12, 2003.<ref name="FDAapproval">{{cite news|title=FDA Approves New Drug for Lowering Cholesterol |url=http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2003/ANS01247.html |date=August 12, 2003 |publisher=The Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=2005-03-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050207153150/http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2003/ANS01247.html |archivedate=2005-02-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>

The results of the [[JUPITER trial]] (2008) suggested rosuvastatin may decrease the [[relative risk]] of [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and [[stroke]] in patients without [[hyperlipidemia]], but with elevated levels of [[C-reactive protein|highly sensitive C-reactive protein]].

===FDA advisory for East Asian patients===
According to the FDA, the risk of myopathy during rosuvastatin therapy may be increased in Asian Americans:
<blockquote>Because Asians appear to process the drug differently, half the standard dose can have the same cholesterol-lowering benefit in those patients, though a full dose could increase the risk of side-effects, a study by the drug's manufacturer, AstraZeneca, indicated.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2005/mar/03/nation/na-crestor3 FDA Advisory Targets Asian Patients (Los Angeles Times)].</ref></blockquote>

Therefore, physicians should start Asian-American or East Asian patients at the lowest dose level.<ref>[http://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/news/20050303/fda-updates-crestor-warning-information Asian-Americans Among Groups More at Risk of Serious Muscle Damage (WebMD)].</ref>

===Patent protection and generic versions===
The main patent protecting rosuvastatin (RE37,314 — due to expire in 2016) was challenged as being an improper reissue of an earlier patent. This challenge was rejected in 2010, confirming protection until 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20100701/BUSINESS/7010316/1003/RSS01 |title=AstraZeneca's Crestor patent upheld;No generic competition until 2016 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>

In April 2016 the FDA approved the first [[generic drug|generic]] version of rosuvastatin (from Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc).<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm498373.htm FDA approves first generic Crestor. April 2016]</ref>

In July 2016 Mylan gained approval for its generic rosuvastatin calcium.<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mylan-launches-generic-crestor-tablets-300301446.html Mylan Launches Generic Crestor® Tablets. July 2016]</ref>

===Marketing===
The drug was billed as a "super-statin" during its clinical development; the claim was that it offers high potency and improved cholesterol reduction compared to rivals in the class. The main competitors to rosuvastatin are [[atorvastatin]] (Lipitor) and [[simvastatin]] (Zocor). However, people can also combine [[ezetimibe]] with either simvastatin or atorvastatin and other agents on their own, for somewhat similar augmented response rates. {{as of|2006}} some published information for comparing rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, and ezetimibe/simvastatin results is available, but many of the relevant studies are still in progress.<ref name="ASTEROID"/>

First launched in 2003, sales of rosuvastatin were $129 million and $908 million in 2003 and 2004, respectively, with a total patient treatment population of over 4 million by the end of 2004.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}
Typical per patient costs to the UK NHS are £18.03–26.02/month (compared to £0.85–1.37/month for [[simvastatin]]).

===Debate and criticisms===
In October 2003, several months after its introduction in [[Europe]], [[Richard Horton (editor)|Richard Horton]], the editor of the [[medical journal]] ''[[The Lancet]]'', criticized the way Crestor had been introduced. "AstraZeneca's tactics in marketing its cholesterol-lowering drug, rosuvastatin, raise disturbing questions about how drugs enter clinical practice and what measures exist to protect patients from inadequately investigated medicines," according to his editorial. ''The Lancet's'' editorial position is that the data for Crestor’s superiority rely too much on extrapolation from the lipid profile data (surrogate end-points) and too little on hard clinical end-points, which are available for other statins that had been on the market longer. The manufacturer responded by stating that few drugs had been tested so successfully on so many patients. In correspondence published in ''The Lancet'', AstraZeneca's CEO [[Tom McKillop|Sir Tom McKillop]] called the editorial "flawed and incorrect" and slammed the journal for making "such an outrageous critique of a serious, well-studied medicine."<!--

In 2004, the consumer interest organization [[Public Citizen]] filed a [[Citizen's Petition]] with the FDA, asking that Crestor be withdrawn from the US market. On March 11, 2005, the FDA issued a letter to Sidney M. Wolfe, M.D. of Public Citizen both denying the petition and providing an extensive detailed analysis of findings that demonstrated no basis for concerns about rosuvastatin compared with the other statins approved for marketing in the United States.<ref name="FDA ruling">{{cite web | author =Food and Drug Administration | title = Docket No. 2004P-0113/CP1 |url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/04p0113/04p-0113-pdn0001.pdf|format=PDF }}</ref>

===Myopathy===
As with all statins, there is a concern of [[rhabdomyolysis]], a severe undesired side effect. The FDA has indicated that "it does not appear that the risk [of rhabdomyolysis] is greater with Crestor than with other marketed statins", but has mandated that a warning about this side-effect, as well as a kidney toxicity warning, be added to the product label.<!--
