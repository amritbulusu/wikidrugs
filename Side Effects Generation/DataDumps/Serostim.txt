'''Serostim''' (recombinant DNA somatropin) is [[Serono]]'s [[brand name]] [[prescription drug]] form of [[recombinant DNA|synthetic]] [[growth hormone]], marketed for [[AIDS|HIV-associated]] [[cachexia|wasting]].<ref>http://www.serostim.com/</ref> 

In December 2007, the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts settled a [[class-action lawsuit]] that involved [[Merck Serono]] and the drug Serostim. The lawsuit claims that Merck Serono encouraged doctors to prescribe Serostim [[off-label]] for criteria that were not approved by the FDA. Merck Serono denies these claims and any liability. However, Merck Serono has entered into a settlement "solely to avoid the further expense, inconvenience, burden, and uncertainty of these lawsuits."

The settlement will pay consumers of Serostim who paid the full cash amount or a co-payment as part of their medical treatment.
