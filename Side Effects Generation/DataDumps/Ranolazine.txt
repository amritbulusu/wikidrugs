'''Ranolazine''', sold under the [[trade name]] '''Ranexa''' by [[Gilead Sciences]], is a drug to treat [[angina]] that was first approved in 2006.

==Medical uses==
Ranolazine is used to treat chronic [[angina]].<ref name=Banon>Banon D et al.  The usefulness of ranolazine for the treatment of refractory chronic stable angina pectoris as determined from a systematic review of randomized controlled trials. Am J Cardiol. 2014 Mar 15;113(6):1075-82. {{PMID|24462341}}</ref> It may be used concomitantly with [[Beta blocker|β blocker]]s, [[Nitrovasodilator|nitrate]]s, [[calcium channel blocker]]s, [[Antiplatelet drug|antiplatelet therapy]], [[Lipid-lowering agent|lipid-lowering therapy]], [[ACE inhibitor]]s, and [[Angiotensin II receptor antagonist|angiotensin receptor blocker]]s.<ref name="Ranexa PI">{{cite web|title=Ranexa (ranolazine) Extended-Release Tablets, for Oral Use. Full Prescribing Information|url=http://www.gilead.com/~/media/Files/pdfs/medicines/cardiovascular/ranexa/ranexa_pi.ashx|publisher=Gilead Sciences, Inc. Foster City, CA 94404|accessdate=8 September 2016}}</ref>

==Contraindications==
Some contraindications for ranolazine are related to its metabolism and are described under Drug Interactions. Additionally, in clinical trials ranolazine slightly increased [[QT interval]] in some patients<ref name=Kloner/> and the FDA label contains a warning for doctors to beware of this effect in their patients.<ref name="Ranexa PI" /> The drug's effect on the QT interval is increased in the setting of liver dysfunction; thus it is contraindicated in persons with mild to severe liver disease.<ref name="FDANews-2006">{{cite news |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2006/ucm108587.htm |title=FDA Approves New Treatment for Chest Pain |publisher=FDA News |date=2006-01-31 |accessdate=2011-03-02}}</ref>

==Side effects==
The most common side effects are dizziness (11.8%) and constipation (10.9%).<ref name=Banon/>  Other side effects include headache and nausea.<ref name=Kloner>Kloner RA, et al.  Efficacy and safety of ranolazine in patients with chronic stable angina. Postgrad Med. 2013 Nov;125(6):43-52. {{PMID|24200760}}</ref>

==Drug interactions==
Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by the [[CYP3A]] enzyme. It also inhibits another metabolizing enzyme, [[CYP2D6|cytochrome CYP2D6]].<ref name="Ranexa PI" /> For this reason, the doses of ranolazine and drugs that interact with those enzymes need to be adjusted when they are used by the same patient.

Ranolazine should not be used with drugs like [[ketoconazole]], [[clarithromycin]], and [[nelfinavir]] that strongly inhibit CYP3A nor with drugs that activate CYP3A like [[rifampin]] and [[phenobarbital]].<ref name="Ranexa PI" />

For drugs that are moderate CYP3A inhibitors like [[diltiazem]], [[verapamil]], [[erythromycin]], the dose of ranolazine should be reduced.<ref name="Ranexa PI" />

Drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 like [[tricyclic antidepressants]] may need to be given at reduced doses when administered with ranolazine.<ref name="Ranexa PI" />

==Mechanism of action==
Ranolazine inhibits persistent or late inward sodium current (''I''<sub>Na</sub>) in heart muscle<ref>D Noble and P J Noble. Late sodium current in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease: consequences of sodium–calcium overload Heart. Jul 2006; 92(Suppl 4): iv1–iv5. {{PMID|16775091}} {{PMC|1861316}}</ref> in a variety of [[Sodium channel#Voltage-gated|voltage-gated sodium channel]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sokolov|first1=S|last2=Peters|first2=CH|last3=Rajamani|first3=S|last4=Ruben|first4=PC|title=Proton-dependent inhibition of the cardiac sodium channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 by ranolazine|journal=Frontiers in Pharmacology|date=2013|volume=4|pages=78|doi=10.3389/fphar.2013.00078|pmid=23801963|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3689222/pdf/fphar-04-00078.pdf|accessdate=8 September 2016|pmc=3689222}}</ref>  Inhibiting that current leads to reductions in elevated intracellular calcium levels.  This in turn leads to reduced tension in the heart wall, leading to reduced oxygen requirements for the muscle.<ref name=Kloner/> The [[Drug-induced QT prolongation|QT prolongation effect]] of ranolazine on the surface electrocardiogram is the result of inhibition of [[hERG|''I''<sub>Kr</sub>]], which prolongs the ventricular [[action potential]].<ref name="Ranexa PI" /> Ranolazine also exhibits its effects on the delayed rectifier current (hERG/''I''<sub>Kr</sub> Potassium channels), it readily stimulates myogenesis, it reduces a pro-oxidant inflammation/oxidative condition, and activates the calcium signaling pathway.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thomsen|first=Morten B.|year=2006|title=Assessing the proarrhythmic potential of drugs: Current status of models and surrogate parameters of torsades de pointes arrhythmias|url=|journal=Pharmacology & Therapeutics|volume=|pages=151–163|via=}}</ref>

Ranolazine prolongs the action potential duration, with corresponding QT interval prolongation on electrocardiography, blocks the ''I''<sub>Na</sub> current, and prevents calcium overload caused by the hyperactive ''I''<sub>Na</sub> current, thus it stabilizes the membrane and reducing excitability.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Banerjee|first=Kinjal|year=2017|title=Role of Ranolazine in cardiovascular disease and diabetes: Exploring beyond angina|url=|journal=International Journal of Cardiology|volume=|pages=557|via=}}</ref>

==Legal status==
Ranolazine was approved by the FDA in January 2006, for the treatment of patients with chronic angina as a second-line treatment in addition to other drugs.<ref name=Kloner/> In 2007 the label was updated to make ranolazine a first-line treatment, alone or with other drugs.<ref name=Kloner/> In April 2008 ranolazine was approved by the European EMEA for use in angina.<ref>EMEA [http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/000805/human_med_001009.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d124 Ranolazine page at the EMEA]</ref>

==History==
In 1996, CV Therapeutics licensed the North American and European rights to ranolazine from [[Syntex]], a subsidiary of [[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche]], which had discovered the drug and had developed it through Phase II trials in angina.<ref>CV Therapeutics press release.  April 1, 1996 [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/CV+THERAPEUTICS+LICENSES+LATE-STAGE+ANTI-ANGINAL+DRUG+FROM+SYNTEX...-a018143758 CV Therapeutics Licenses Late-Stage Anti-Anginal Drug from Syntex (U.S.A.), an Affiliate of Roche Holding Ltd.]</ref>  In 2006, CV Therapeutics acquired the remaining worldwide rights to ranolazine from Roche.<ref>CV Therapeutics, 22 June 2006 [http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cv-therapeutics-acquires-rights-to-ranolazine-in-asia-56223507.html CV Therapeutics Acquires Rights to Ranolazine in Asia]</ref> In 2008 CV Therapeutics exclusively licensed rights for ranolazine in Europe and some other countries to [[Menarini]].<ref>Thepharmaletter.com 22 September 2008 [http://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/italy-s-menarini-to-pay-up-to-385-million-for-rights-to-cv-thera-s-ranexa Italy's Menarini to pay up to $385 million for rights to CV Thera's Ranexa]</ref>
In 2009, Gilead acquired CV Therapeutics.<ref>Reuters, via the New York Times. 12 March 2009.
