'''2C-T-4''' ('''2,5-dimethoxy-4-isopropylthiophenethylamine''') is a [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] [[phenethylamine]] of the [[2C (psychedelics)|2C family]].  It was first synthesized by [[Alexander Shulgin]] and is used as [[entheogen]]ic [[recreational drug]].

==Chemistry==

2C-T-4 is the [[2C (psychedelics)|2-carbon]] [[homologous series|homolog]] of [[Aleph (psychedelic)|aleph-4]]. The full chemical name is 2-[4-([[isopropyl]][[Thio-|thio]])-2,5-di[[methoxy]][[phenyl]]]-[[ethyl group|ethan]][[amine]].  The drug has [[structure|structural]] and [[pharmacodynamic]] properties similar to [[2C-T-7]] and [[2C-T-9]].{{cn|date=March 2015}}

==Effects==
2C-T-4 produces psychedelic and entheogenic effects that develop slowly and can last 8–16 hours.{{medcn|date=March 2015}}  While users may experience virtually no effects for the first hour after ingestion, results vary drastically between individuals and range from [[hallucination]] and [[euphoria]] to intense sickness and anxiety.<ref name="CitePiHKAL">{{CitePiHKAL}}</ref>  Shulgin devoted a chapter in the first part of his book ''[[PiHKAL]]'' to this compound, describing an intense [[Shulgin Rating Scale|"plus-four"]] psychedelic experience mediated by a twelve milligram dose.

==Pharmacology==
{{OR section|date=March 2015}}
The mechanism that produces 2C-T-4’s hallucinogenic and entheogenic effects has not been specifically established, however it is most likely to result from action as a [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]] [[5-HT receptor|serotonin receptor]] [[agonist]] in the brain, a mechanism of action shared by all of the hallucinogenic tryptamines and phenethylamines for which the mechanism of action is known.

==Popularity==

2C-T-4 is relatively unknown on the black market, but has been sold to a limited extent on the [[research chemical]] market.

==Drug prohibition laws==

===Canada===
As of October 31st, 2016; 2C-T-4 is a controlled substance (Schedule III) in Canada. http://gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2016/2016-05-04/html/sor-dors72-eng.php

===Sweden===
[[Riksdag|''Sveriges riksdags'']] health ministry [[:sv:Statens folkhälsoinstitut|''Statens folkhälsoinstitut'']] classified 2C-T-4 as "health hazard" under the act [[:sv:Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor|''Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor'']] (translated ''Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health'') as of Jul 15, 2007,  in their regulation '''SFS 2007:600''' listed as '''2,5-dimetoxi-4-isopropyltiofenetylamin (2C-T-4)''', making it illegal to sell or possess.<ref>http://www.notisum.se/rnp/sls/sfs/20070600.pdf</ref>

===USA===
As of July 9, 2012, 2C-T-4 is a Schedule I substance in the United States, under the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012.<ref>{{cite web|last=Portman|title=Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/s3190/text|publisher=Govtrack|accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref>

==Homologue==

[[Image:Psi-2C-T-4.png|thumb|200px|right|Ψ-2C-T-4, the homologue of 2C-T-4]]

2C-T-4 has one homologue, the structural isomer Ψ-2C-T-4 (2,6-dimethoxy-4-(i)-propylthiophenethylamine).  This compound was tested by [[Alexander Shulgin]] at a dose of 12 mg. 

At this dosage its duration was very short and it produced few effects, however based on the research into the better characterized compound [[Psi-DOM|Ψ-DOM]], the potency of Ψ-2C-T-4 is likely to be around 1/3 that of 2C-T-4 itself, so a more effective dosage of Ψ-2C-T-4 might be in the region of 20–60 mg;<ref name="CitePiHKAL"/> however high doses such as this might well be associated with toxic side effects, and so extreme caution would be advised.
