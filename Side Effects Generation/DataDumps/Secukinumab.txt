'''Secukinumab''', [[trade name]] '''Cosentyx''', is a human IgG1Îº [[monoclonal antibody]] that binds to the protein [[interleukin 17|interleukin (IL)-17A]],
and is marketed by [[Novartis]] for the treatment of [[psoriasis]], [[ankylosing spondylitis]], and [[psoriatic arthritis]].<ref name=UKlabel>{{cite web|title=Cosentyx 150 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen - Summary of Product Characteristics|url=https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/29848|publisher=UK Electronic Medicines Compendium|accessdate=2 October 2017|language=en|date=15 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=USlabel>{{cite web|title=Cosentyx (secukinumab) injection|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/125504s016lbl.pdf|publisher=FDA|date=September 2017}} For label updates see [https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=overview.process&varApplNo=125504 FDA index page for BLA 125504]</ref>

It inhibits a member of the [[cytokine]] family, [[IL17A|interleukin 17A]].<ref name=UKlabel/>

== Medical uses ==
It is used to treat [[psoriasis]], [[ankylosing spondylitis]], and [[psoriatic arthritis]].<ref name=UKlabel/><ref name=USlabel/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Patel|first1=NU|last2=Vera|first2=NC|last3=Shealy|first3=ER|last4=Wetzel|first4=M|last5=Feldman|first5=SR|title=A Review of the Use of Secukinumab for Psoriatic Arthritis.|journal=Rheumatology and therapy|date=28 August 2017|doi=10.1007/s40744-017-0076-0|pmid=28849401}}</ref>  It is given by [[subcutaneous injection]]  and is sold in a pre-filled syringe or [[autoinjector]] that can be used at home and as a lyophilized powder for use in hospitals and clinics.<ref name=USlabel/>

Secukinumab was not tested in pregnant women; animal studies did not show harm at relevant doses.  The FDA advises that the drug should be used in pregnant women only if the risk to the fetus justifies the potential benefit;<ref name=USlabel/> the EMA advises that women should not become pregnant while taking it.<ref name=UKlabel/>

It should not be given to people with active infections since it is suppresses the immune system.<ref name=UKlabel/>

== Adverse effects ==
Very common (greater than 10% of people experience them) adverse effects include upper respiratory tract infections
<ref name=UKlabel/>

Common (between 1% and 10% of people experience them) include oral herpes, runny nose, and diarrhea.<ref name=UKlabel/>

In clinical trials there were rare instances of hypersensitivity reactions, severe infections, and some cases of serious inflammatory bowel disease, some of which were new and some of which were exacerbations of existing conditions.<ref name=USlabel/>

== Pharmacology ==
It inhibits a member of the [[cytokine]] family, [[IL17A|interleukin 17A]], which is produced mainly by inflammatory [[T helper 17 cell]]s.<ref name=Lubrano2016>{{cite journal|last1=Lubrano|first1=E|last2=Perrotta|first2=FM|title=Secukinumab for ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis.|journal=Therapeutics and clinical risk management|date=2016|volume=12|pages=1587-1592|doi=10.2147/TCRM.S100091|pmid=27799780|pmc=5085310}}</ref>  IL17A is upregulated in serum of people with psoriasis and in the synovial fluid of people with psoriatic arthritis, and promotes inflammation when it binds to the [[interleukin-17 receptor]] which is expressed in various types of cells, including [[keratinocytes]] in skin.<ref name=Lubrano2016/><ref name=Shirley2016>{{cite journal|last1=Shirley|first1=M|last2=Scott|first2=LJ|title=Secukinumab: A Review in Psoriatic Arthritis.|journal=Drugs|date=July 2016|volume=76|issue=11|pages=1135-45|doi=10.1007/s40265-016-0602-3|pmid=27299434}}</ref>

It is mostly eliminated by being taken up into cells via [[endocytosis]] and being broken down inside them.<ref name=UKlabel/>

Secukinumab is a recombinant fully human IgG1/kappa monoclonal antibody and is manufactured in chinese hamster ovary cells.<ref name=UKlabel/>
