'''Girentuximab''' (trade name '''Rencarex''') is a [[chimeric antibody|chimeric]] IgG1 [[monoclonal antibody]] to [[carbonic anhydrase IX]] (CAIX).<ref>{{cite web|title=Statement On A Nonproprietary Name Adopted By The USAN Council: Girentuximab|publisher=[[American Medical Association]]|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/usan/girentuximab.pdf}}</ref> CAIX is expressed on the surface of most renal cancer cells and is hypothesized to be on the surface of other tumor cells. It is investigational agent in clinical trials for [[renal cell carcinoma]].<ref name="pmid24215158">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bedke J, Stenzl A | title = Immunotherapeutic strategies for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma: where are we now? | journal = Expert Review of Anticancer Therapy | volume = 13 | issue = 12 | pages = 1399â€“408 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24215158 | doi = 10.1586/14737140.2013.856761 }}</ref> Its development was suspended as a "naked" or unconjugated antibody during phase III trials due to efficacy.<ref>https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00087022?term=girentuximab&rank=6</ref><ref>http://www.fiercebiotech.com/r-d/cyclacel-s-cancer-drug-isn-t-working-phase-iii-but-won-t-stop-trial</ref> 

Girentuximab was originally developed by Wilex AG. It was granted [[fast track (FDA)|fast track]] status and [[orphan drug designation]] by the [[FDA]] for renal cancer.<ref>adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800006571</ref> In January 2017, Telix Pharmaceuticals Limited, an Australian biotechnology company, announced that it had in-licensed Girentuximab for use as a radioimmunoconjugate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wilex.de/press-investors/announcements/press-releases/20170116-2/|title=WILEX signs antibody license agreement with Telix Pharmaceuticals Limited {{!}} WILEX AG|website=www.wilex.de|language=de-DE|access-date=2017-09-18}}</ref>

It triggers [[antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity]] (ADCC). It does this by activating [[natural killer cell]]s by binding to [[carbonic anhydrase IX]].<ref>[http://www.hsric.nihr.ac.uk/topics/girentuximab-rencarex-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/ Girentuximab (Rencarex) for renal cell carcinoma]</ref>
