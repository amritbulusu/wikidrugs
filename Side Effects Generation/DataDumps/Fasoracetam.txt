'''Fasoracetam'''  is a [[research chemical]] of the [[racetam]] family.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=198695|title=5-oxo-D-prolinepiperidinamide monohydrate - Compound Summary|accessdate=21 July 2013}}</ref> It is a [[nootropic]], and has been in clinical trials for [[vascular dementia]] and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]].<ref name=adis/><ref>{{cite journal|title=Recommended INN List 40|journal=WHO Drug Information|date=1998|volume=12|issue=2|url=https://mednet-communities.net/inn/db/media/docs/r-innlist40.pdf}}</ref>

Fasoracetam appears to agonize all three [[metabotropic glutamate receptor]]s and has improved cognitive function in rodent studies.<ref name=Connolly/> It is orally available and is excreted mostly unchanged via the urine.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Malykh|first1=AG|last2=Sadaie|first2=MR|title=Piracetam and piracetam-like drugs: from basic science to novel clinical applications to CNS disorders.|journal=Drugs|date=12 February 2010|volume=70|issue=3|pages=287-312|doi=10.2165/11319230-000000000-00000|pmid=20166767}}</ref>

Fasoracetam was discovered by scientists at the Japanese pharmaceutical company [[Nippon Shinyaku]], which brought it through Phase 3 clinical trials for [[vascular dementia]], and abandoned it due to lack of efficacy.<ref name=Connolly>{{cite journal |title=ADHD & Pharmacotherapy: Past, Present and Future: A Review of the Changing Landscape of Drug Therapy for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. | volume=49(5) | journal=Ther Innov Regul Sci  | pages=632-642 | last1 = Connolly| first1 = J | last2 = Glessner | first2 = J | last3 = Kao | first3 = C | last4 = Elia | first4 = J | last5 = Hakonarson | first5 = H | doi=10.1177/2168479015599811|pmid=26366330|pmc=4564067}}</ref><ref name=Hoskowitz>{{cite book|last1=Moskowitz|first1=D.

Scientists at [[Children's Hospital of Philadelphia]] led by Hakon Hakonarson identified fasoracetam's potential use in [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]].<ref name=Connolly/> Hakonarson started a company called neuroFix Therapeutics, LLC to try to bring the drug to market for this use; neuroFix acquired Nippon Shinyaku's clinical data as part of its efforts.<ref name=Hoskowitz/><ref name=Alpha/>   neuroFix was acquired by Medgenics in 2015.<ref name=Alpha/>  Medgenics changed its name to Aevi Genomic Medicine in 2016.<ref>{{cite web | title=Press Release: Medgenics, Inc.
