'''Pentoxyverine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|rINN]]) or '''carbetapentane''' is an [[antitussive]] (cough suppressant) commonly used for cough associated with illnesses like [[common cold]]. It is sold [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] in the United States as '''Solotuss''',<ref name="Drugs.com">
{{cite web

{{cite web

The drug is available in the form of drops, [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]]s and [[suppositories]].<ref name="Drugs.com" /><ref name="AustriaCodex">

==Uses==
The drug is used for the treatment of dry cough associated with conditions such as common cold, [[bronchitis]] or [[sinusitis]]. Like [[codeine]] and other antitussives, it relieves the symptom, but does not heal the illness.<ref name="Drugs.com" /> No controlled [[clinical trial]]s regarding the efficiency of pentoyxverine are available.<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" />

[[Pharmacologist]]s use the substance as a selective [[agonist]] at the [[sigma-1 receptor]] in animal<ref name="Brown">

}}</ref> or other kinds of [[respiratory insufficiency]] (breathing difficulties), as well as angle-closure [[glaucoma]]. No data are available for the use of pentoxyverine during pregnancy, [[lactation]], or children under two years of age, wherefore the drug must not be used under these circumstances.<ref name="AustriaCodex" />

Antitussive drugs are not useful in patients with extensive [[phlegm]] production because they prevent coughing up the phlegm.<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" />

==Adverse effects==
The most common side effects (seen in more than 1% of patients) are upper abdominal (belly) pain, diarrhoea, dry mouth, and nausea or vomiting. [[Allergic reaction]]s of the skin like itching, rashes, [[hives]] and [[angiooedema]] are rare. The same is true for [[anaphylactic shock]] and [[convulsion]]s.<ref name="AustriaCodex" /><ref>

==Overdose==
Overdosage leads to drowsiness, [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]], nausea and [[anticholinergic]] effects like [[tachycardia]] (high heart rate), dry mouth, blurred vision, glaucoma, or [[urinary retention]].<ref name="Drugs.com" /><ref name="AustriaCodex" /> Especially in children, pentoxyverine can cause [[hypoventilation]],<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" /> but much more seldom than codeine and other [[opioid]] antitussives.

The treatment of overdosage aims at the symptoms; there are no specific [[antidote]]s available.<ref name="AustriaCodex" />

==Interactions==
No interactions have been described at usual doses. It is possible that pentoxyverine can increase the potency of sedative drugs like [[benzodiazepine]]s, some [[anticonvulsant]]s and [[antidepressant]]s, and alcohol. Likewise, some consumer informations warn patients from taking the drug in combination with or up to two weeks after [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s, which are known to cause potentially fatal reactions in combination with the (chemically only distantly related) antitussive [[dextromethorphan]].<ref name="Drugs.com" /><ref name="AustriaCodex" /><ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" />

==Mechanism of action==
Pentoxyverine suppresses the [[cough reflex]] in the [[central nervous system]],<ref name="Drugs.com" /> but the exact mechanism of action is not known with certainty. The drug acts as an [[Receptor antagonist | antagonist]] at [[muscarinic receptors]]<ref name="AustriaCodex" /> (subtype [[M1 receptor | M<sub>1</sub>]]) and as an agonist at [[sigma receptor]]s (subtype σ<sub>1</sub>).<ref name="Brown" /> Its [[anticholinergic]] properties can theoretically relax the [[pulmonary alveoli]] and reduce phlegm production. [[Antispasmodic|Spasmolytic]] and local anaesthetic properties have also been described.<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" /> The clinical relevance of these mechanisms is uncertain.

==Pharmacokinetics==
The substance is absorbed quickly from the gut and reaches its [[Cmax (pharmacology)|maximum plasma concentration]] (C<sub>max</sub>) after about two hours. If applied rectally, C<sub>max</sub> is reached after four hours. The [[bioavailability]] of the suppositories, measured as [[Area under the curve (pharmacokinetics)|area under the curve]] (AUC), is about twofold that of oral formulations, due to a [[first pass effect]] of over 50%. By far the most important metabolisation reaction is [[ester hydrolysis]], which accounts for 26.3% of the total clearance through the kidneys. Only 0.37% are cleared in form of the original substance.<ref name="AustriaCodex" /> The [[Biological half-life|plasma half life]] is 2.3 hours for oral formulations and three to 3.5 hours for suppositories.<ref>

==Chemical properties==
Pentoxyverine dihydrogen [[citrate]], the salt that is commonly used for oral preparations, is a white to off-white, crystalline powder. It dissolves easily in water or [[chloroform]], but not in [[benzene]], [[diethyl ether]], or [[petroleum ether]]. It melts at {{convert|90 to 95|C|F}}.<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" /> Other orally available salts are the [[hydrochloride]] and the [[tannate]];<ref>
