'''Mitoxantrone''' (INN, BAN, USAN; also known as '''Mitozantrone''' in Australia; trade name '''Novantrone''') is an [[anthracenedione]] [[antineoplastic]] agent.

==Uses==
Mitoxantrone is used to treat certain types of cancer, mostly [[metastasis|metastatic]] [[breast cancer]], [[acute myeloid leukemia]], and [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]]. It improves the survival rate of children suffering from [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] relapse.<ref name="Parker">{{cite journal |vauthors=Parker C, Waters R, Leighton C, Hancock J, Sutton R, Moorman AV, Ancliff P, Morgan M, Masurekar A, Goulden N, Green N, Révész T, Darbyshire P, Love S, Saha V |title=Effect of mitoxantrone on outcome of children with first relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL R3): an open-label randomised trial |journal=Lancet |volume= 376|issue= 9757|pages= 2009–2017|year=2010 |pmid=21131038 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)62002-8 |pmc=3010035}}</ref>

The combination of mitoxantrone and [[prednisone]] is approved as a second-line treatment for metastatic hormone-refractory [[prostate cancer]]. Until recently this combination was the first line of treatment; however, a combination of [[docetaxel]] and prednisone improves survival rates and lengthens the disease-free period.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Cancer Chemotherapy |author=Katzung, Bertram G. |title=Basic and clinical pharmacology |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical Publishing Division |location=New York |year=2006 |isbn=0-07-145153-6 |edition=10th |oclc=157011367}}</ref>
 
Mitoxantrone is also used to treat [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS), most notably the [[Multiple sclerosis#Clinical course|subset of the disease]] known as secondary-progressive MS. Absent a cure mitoxantrone is effective in slowing the progression of secondary-progressive MS and extending the time between relapses in both relapsing-remitting MS and progressive-relapsing MS.<ref name="Fox">{{cite journal |author=Fox E |title=Management of worsening multiple sclerosis with mitoxantrone: a review |journal=Clin Ther |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=461–74 |year=2006 |pmid=16750460 |doi=10.1016/j.clinthera.2006.04.013}}</ref>

==Side effects==
Mitoxantrone, as with other drugs in its class,  may cause [[adverse drug reaction|adverse reactions]] of varying severity, including [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[hair loss]], heart damage and [[immunosuppression]], possibly with delayed onset. [[Cardiomyopathy]] is a particularly concerning effect as it is irreversible; thus regular monitoring with [[echocardiogram]]s or [[MUGA scan]]s is recommended for patients.

Because of the risk of cardiomyopathy, mitoxantrone carries a limit on the cumulative lifetime dose (based on body surface area) in MS patients.<ref name="FDA Postmarket Drug Safety">{{cite web|title=Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride (marketed as Novantrone and generics) – Healthcare Professional Sheet text version|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm126445.htm|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=19 September 2014|ref=fdapostmarket}}</ref>
