==Discovery==
Lacosamide was discovered by Dr. Harold Kohn, Dr. Shridhar Andurkar, and colleagues at the University of Houston in 1996.<ref name="pmid_8627614">{{cite journal|last=Choi|first=D|author2=Stables, JP |author3=Kohn, H |title=Synthesis and anticonvulsant activities of ''N''-Benzyl-2-acetamidopropionamide derivatives.|journal=Journal of Medicinal Chemistry|date=Apr 26, 1996|volume=39|issue=9|pages=1907–16|pmid=8627614|doi=10.1021/jm9508705}}</ref><ref>https://www.google.com/patents/WO2000000463A1?cl=en&dq=shridhar+andurkar&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiV4IXozOzOAhWCPBoKHV8JDMQQ6AEILDAC</ref> They hypothesized that modified amino acids may be therapeutically useful in the treatment of epilepsy. A few hundred such molecules were synthesized over several years and these were tested phenotypically in an epilepsy disease model performed in rats. N-benzyl-2-acetamido-3-methoxypropionamide was found to be highly efficacious in this model, with the biological activity traced specifically to its R enantiomer.<ref name="pmid_8627614"/> 
This compound was to become Lacosamide after being licensed by Schwarz Pharma, which completed its pre-clinical and early clinical development. After its purchase of Schwarz Pharma in 2006, Union Chimique Belge ([[UCB (company)|UCB]]) completed the clinical development program and obtained marketing approval for Lacosamide. Interestingly, its precise mechanism of action was unknown at the time of approval.<ref name="works.bepress.com">{{cite journal |author1=Michael A. Rogawski |author2=Azita Tofighy |author3=H.

==Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamics==
Lacosamide is a functionalized amino acid that produces activity in the maximal electroshock seizure (MES) test, that, like some other [[antiepileptic drugs]] (AEDs), are believed to act through [[Sodium channel|voltage-gated sodium channels]].<ref name="works.bepress.com"/> Lacosamide enhances the slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels without affecting the fast inactivation of [[Sodium channel|voltage-gated sodium channels]]. This inactivation prevents the channel from opening, helping end the action potential. Many antiepileptic drugs, like [[carbamazepine]] or [[lamotrigine]], slow the recovery from inactivation and hence reduce the ability of neurons to fire [[action potentials]]. Inactivation only occurs in neurons firing action potentials; this means that drugs that modulate fast inactivation selectively reduce the firing in active cells. Slow inactivation is similar but does not produce complete blockade of voltage gated sodium channels, with both activation and inactivation occurring over hundreds of milliseconds or more. Lacosamide makes this inactivation happen at less depolarized [[membrane potential]]s. This means that lacosamide only affects neurons which are depolarized or active for long periods of time, typical of neurons at the focus of [[epilepsy]].<ref name="pmid17940193">{{cite journal |vauthors=Errington AC, Stöhr T, Heers C, Lees G |title=The investigational anticonvulsant lacosamide selectively enhances slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels |journal=Molecular Pharmacology |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=157–69 |date=January 2008 |pmid=17940193 |doi=10.1124/mol.107.039867 |url=}}</ref> Lacosamide administration results in the inhibition of repetitive neuronal firing, the stabilization of hyperexcitable neuronal membranes, and the reduction of long-term channel availability, but does not affect physiological function.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Doty|first=P|author2=Hebert D |author3=Mathy FX |author4=Byrnes W |author5=Zackheim J |author6=Simontacchi K |title=Development of lacosamide for the treatment of partial-onset seizures|journal=Ann N Y Acad Sci|year=2013|volume=1291|pages=56–68|doi=10.1111/nyas.12213|pmid=23859801 |pmc=3759704}}</ref>  Lacosamide has a dual mechanism of action. It also modulates [[Collapsin response mediator protein family|collapsin response mediator protein 2]] (CRMP-2), preventing the formation of abnormal neuronal connections in the brain.<ref>{{cite news|title=SCHWARZ PHARMA Highlights the Results of 13 Lacosamide Data Presentations at North American Regional Epilepsy Congress in San Diego|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/schwarz-pharma-highlights-the-results-of-13-lacosamide-data-presentations-at-north-american-regional-epilepsy-congress-in-san-diego-55922847.html|accessdate=2 April 2014|newspaper=Schwarz Pharma|date=5 December 1996}}</ref>

==Pharmacokinetics==
When administered orally in healthy individuals, lacosamide is rapidly absorbed from the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]]. Little of the drug is lost via the [[first pass effect]], and thus has an oral [[bioavailability]] of nearly 100%.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hovinga|first=CA|title=SPM-927 (Schwarz Pharma)|journal=IDrugs|year=2003|volume=6|issue=5|pages=479–85|pmid=12789603|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12789603|accessdate=2 April 2014}}</ref>   In adults, lacosamide demonstrates a low plasma protein binding of <15, which reduces the potential for interaction with other drugs. Lacosamide is at its highest concentration in blood plasma approximately 1 to 4 hours after oral administration. Lacosamide has a half life of about 12–16 hours, which remains unchanged if the patients is also taking enzyme inducers. Consequently, the drug is administered twice per day at 12-hour intervals. Lacosamide is excreted renally, with 95% of the drug eliminated in the urine.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Italiano|first=D|author2=Perucca E |title=Clinical pharmacokinetics of new-generation antiepileptic drugs at the extremes of age: an update|journal=Clin Pharmacokinet|year=2013|volume=52|issue=8|pages=627–45|doi=10.1007/s40262-013-0067-4|pmid=23640503|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23640503|accessdate=2 April 2014}}</ref>  40% of the compound remains unchanged from its original structure, while the rest of the elimination product consists of metabolites of lacosamide.

===Dosage===
Lacosamide is initially prescribed in oral doses of 50&nbsp;mg twice per day, with a total dose of 100&nbsp;mg/day.The dosing can be increased by 100&nbsp;mg/day following a twice-daily dose up to a total dose of 200–400&nbsp;mg/day. Clinical trials showed that a dose of 600&nbsp;mg/day was not more effective than a dose of 400&nbsp;mg/day, but resulted in more adverse reactions. Lacosamide is administered orally through film-coated tablets of 50&nbsp;mg (pink), 100&nbsp;mg (dark yellow), 150&nbsp;mg (salmon), and 200&nbsp;mg (blue). It can also be administered by injection at a concentration of 200&nbsp;mg/20 mL or by oral solution at a concentration of 10&nbsp;mg/mL.<ref name="Vimpat">{{cite web|title=Highlights of Prescribing Information|url=http://www.vimpat.com/pdf/pi.pdf|publisher=Vimpat|accessdate=2 April 2014}}</ref>

===Warnings===
Suicidal behavior and ideation have been observed as early as one week after starting treatment with lacosamide, and is an [[adverse reaction]] from use of most AEDs. In clinical trials with a medial treatment duration of 12 weeks, the incidence of suicidal ideation was 0.43% among 27,863 patients as opposed to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients. Suicidal behavior was observed in 1 of every 530 patients treated.<ref name="Vimpat"/>>

===In pregnancy===
In a study conducted to assess the [[Teratogen|teratogenic potential]] of AEDs in the zebrafish embryo, the teratogenicity index of lacosamide was found to be higher than that of [[lamotrigine]], [[levetiracetam]], and [[ethosuximide]]. Lacosamide administration resulted in different malformations in the neonatal zebrafish depending on dosage.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=SH|author2=Kang, JW |author3=Lin, T |author4=Lee, JE |author5= Jin, DI |title=Teratogenic potential of antiepileptic drugs in the zebrafish model.|journal=BioMed research international|year=2013|volume=2013|pages=726478|doi=10.1155/2013/726478|pmid=24324971 |pmc=3845484}}</ref>

The [[FDA]] has assigned lacosamide to pregnancy category C. Animal studies have reported incidences of fetal mortality and growth deficit. Lacosamide has not been tested during human pregnancy, and should be administered with caution. In addition, it has not been determined whether the excretion of lacosamide occurs in breast milk.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lacosamide Pregnancy and Breastfeeding Warnings|url=http://www.drugs.com/pregnancy/lacosamide.html|publisher=Drugs.com|accessdate=2 April 2014}}</ref>

===Off-label use===
Lacosamide may have a variety of off-label uses, including for [[pain management]] and treatment of [[mental health disorders]]. Lacosamide and other AEDs have been used off-label in the management of [[bipolar disorder]], cocaine addiction, [[dementia]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[Diabetic neuropathy|diabetic peripheral neuropathy]], [[fibromyalgia]], [[headache]], [[hiccoughs]], [[Huntington's disease]], [[mania]], [[migraine]], [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], [[panic disorder]], [[restless leg syndrome]], and [[tinnitus]]. Combinations of AEDs are often employed for seizure reduction. Studies are underway for the use of lacosamide as a monotherapy for partial onset seizures, diabetic neuropathy, and fibromyalgia.<ref name="Therapeutic Class Review"/>

==Chemistry==
Lacosamide is a powdery, white to light yellow crystalline compound. The chemical name of lacosamide is (''R'')-2-acetamido-''N''-benzyl-3-methoxypropionamide and the systemic name is  ''N2''-Acetyl-''N''-benzyl-''O''-methyl-''D''-serinamide.<ref name="Beyreuther 21–42"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Lacosamide|url=http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.189902.html|publisher=ChemSpider|accessdate=2 April 2014}}</ref>  Lacosamide is a functionalized amino acid molecule that has high solubility in water and DMSO, with a solubility of 20.1&nbsp;mg/mL in [[phosphate-buffered saline]] (PBS, pH 7.5, 25&nbsp;°C).<ref name="Beyreuther 21–42"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Biton|first=V|author2=Rosenfeld, WE |author3=Whitesides, J |author4=Fountain, NB |author5=Vaiciene, N |author6= Rudd, GD |title=Intravenous lacosamide as replacement for oral lacosamide in patients with partial-onset seizures.|journal=Epilepsia|date=Mar 2008|volume=49|issue=3|pages=418–24|pmid=17888078 |doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2007.01317.x}}</ref>   The molecule has six rotatable bonds and one [[aromatic]] ring.

===Synthesis===
The following three-step synthesis of lacosamide was proposed in 1996.

[[File:Synthesis of Lacosamide.jpg|500pm]]

(''R'')-2-amino-3-hydroxypropanoic acid is treated with [[acetic anhydride]] and [[acetic acid]]. The product is treated first with ''N''-methylmorpholine, isobutyl chloroformate, and [[benzylamine]], next with [[methyl iodide]] and [[silver oxide]], forming lacosamide.<ref name="pmid_8627614"/>

More efficient routes to synthesis have been proposed in recent years, including the following.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morieux|first=P|author2=Stables, JP |author3=Kohn, H |title=Synthesis and anticonvulsant activities of ''N''-benzyl-(2''R'')-2-acetamido-3-oxysubstituted propionamide derivatives.|journal=Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry|date=Oct 1, 2008|volume=16|issue=19|pages=8968–75|pmid=18789868|doi=10.1016/j.bmc.2008.08.055|pmc=2701728}}</ref>
