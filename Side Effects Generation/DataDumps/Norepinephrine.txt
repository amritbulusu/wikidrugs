'''Norepinephrine''' ('''NE'''), also called '''noradrenaline''' ('''NA''') or '''noradrenalin''', is an [[organic compound|organic chemical]] in the [[catecholamine]] family that functions in the [[brain]] and [[human body|body]] as a [[hormone]] and [[neurotransmitter]]. The name "noradrenaline," derived from Latin roots meaning "at/alongside the kidneys," is more commonly used in the United Kingdom; in the United States, "norepinephrine," derived from Greek roots having that same meaning, is usually preferred.<ref name=BMJ>{{cite journal | vauthors = Aronson JK | title = "Where name and image meet"--the argument for "adrenaline" | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 320 | issue = 7233 | pages = 506–9 | date = Feb 2000 | pmid = 10678871 | pmc = 1127537 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.320.7233.506 }}</ref> "Norepinephrine" is also the [[international nonproprietary name]] given to the [[norepinephrine (drug)|drug]].<ref name="Norepi INN – IUPHAR">{{cite web|title=(-)-noradrenaline|url=http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?tab=summary&ligandId=505|work=IUPHAR database|publisher=International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology|accessdate=2 January 2016}}</ref> Regardless of which name is used for the substance itself, parts of the body that produce or are affected by it are referred to as '''noradrenergic'''.

In the brain, norepinephrine is produced in nuclei that are small yet exert powerful effects on other brain areas. The most important of these nuclei is the [[locus coeruleus]], located in the [[pons]]. Outside the brain, norepinephrine is used as a neurotransmitter by [[sympathetic ganglion|sympathetic ganglia]] located near the [[spinal cord]] or in the [[abdomen]], and it is also released directly into the bloodstream by the [[adrenal gland]]s. Regardless of how and where it is released, norepinephrine acts on target cells by binding to and activating [[noradrenergic receptor]]s located on the cell surface.

The general function of norepinephrine is to mobilize the brain and body for action.  Norepinephrine release is lowest during sleep, rises during wakefulness, and reaches much higher levels during situations of stress or danger, in the so-called [[fight-or-flight response]]. In the brain, norepinephrine increases arousal and alertness, promotes vigilance, enhances formation and retrieval of memory, and focuses attention; it also increases restlessness and anxiety. In the rest of the body, norepinephrine increases [[heart rate]] and [[blood pressure]], triggers the release of [[glucose]] from energy stores, increases [[blood flow]] to [[skeletal muscle]], reduces blood flow to the gastrointestinal system, and inhibits voiding of the bladder and [[gastrointestinal motility]].

A variety of medically important drugs work by altering the actions of norepinephrine systems.  [[Norepinephrine (drug)|Norepinephrine]] itself is widely used as an injectable drug for the treatment of critically low blood pressure.  [[Beta blocker]]s, which counter some of the effects of norepinephrine, are frequently used to treat [[glaucoma]], [[migraine]], and a range of cardiovascular problems.  [[Alpha blocker]]s, which counter a different set of norepinephrine effects, are used to treat several cardiovascular and psychiatric conditions.  [[Alpha-adrenergic receptor|Alpha-2 agonists]] often have a sedating effect, and are commonly used as anesthesia-enhancers in surgery, as well as in treatment of drug or alcohol dependence. Many important psychiatric drugs exert strong effects on norepinephrine systems in the brain, resulting in side-effects that may be helpful or harmful.

Norepinephrine is a [[catecholamine]] and a [[phenethylamine]].<ref name=PubChem>{{cite web |url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/439260 |title=Norepinephrine |work=PubChem |accessdate=6 November 2015}}</ref> Its structure differs from that of [[epinephrine]] only in that epinephrine has a [[methyl group]] attached to its nitrogen, whereas the methyl group is replaced by a hydrogen atom in norepinephrine.<ref name=PubChem/> The prefix ''[[nor-]]'' is derived as an abbreviation of the word "normal", used to indicate a [[Demethylation|demethylated]] compound.<ref name="gaddum-apology">{{cite journal |author=Gaddum JH |title=The Prefix 'Nor' in Chemical Nomenclature |language= |journal=Nature |volume=177 |issue=1046 |pages= 1046–1046|date=June 1956 |pmid= |doi=10.1038/1771046b0 |url=|bibcode = 1956Natur.177.1046G }}</ref>

==Biochemical mechanisms==

===Biosynthesis===

{{Catecholamine and trace amine biosynthesis|align=right|caption=Norepinephrine is synthesized from dopamine in the human body by the [[dopamine β-hydroxylase]] (DBH) [[enzyme]].}}
Norepinephrine is [[biosynthesis|synthesized]] from the [[amino acid]] [[tyrosine]] by a series of enzymatic steps in the [[adrenal medulla]] and [[postganglionic neuron]]s of the [[sympathetic nervous system]]. While the conversion of tyrosine to dopamine occurs predominantly in the cytoplasm, the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine by [[dopamine β-monooxygenase]] occurs predominantly inside [[synaptic vesicle|neurotransmitter vesicles]].<ref name=Musacchio/> The [[metabolic pathway]] is:

:Phenylalanine → Tyrosine → L-DOPA → Dopamine → Norepinephrine<ref name=Musacchio/>

Thus the direct precursor of norepinephrine is [[dopamine]], which is synthesized indirectly from the essential amino acid [[phenylalanine]] or the non-essential amino acid [[tyrosine]].<ref name=Musacchio/> These amino acids are found in nearly every protein and, as such, are provided by ingestion of protein-containing food, with tyrosine being the most common.

Phenylalanine is converted into tyrosine by the enzyme [[phenylalanine hydroxylase]], with molecular [[oxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>) and [[tetrahydrobiopterin]] as [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]].  Tyrosine is converted into [[L-DOPA]] by the enzyme [[tyrosine hydroxylase]], with [[tetrahydrobiopterin]], O<sub>2</sub>, and probably [[ferrous|ferrous iron]] (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) as cofactors.<ref name=Musacchio>{{cite book |title=Biochemistry of Biogenic Amines |chapter=Chapter 1: Enzymes involved in the biosynthesis and degradation of catecholamines | vauthors= Musacchio JM | veditors = Iverson L |publisher=Springer |isbn=1-4684-3171-4 |year=2013 |pages=1–35}}</ref> L-DOPA is converted into dopamine by the enzyme [[aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase|aromatic <small>L</small>-amino acid decarboxylase]] (also known as DOPA decarboxylase), with [[pyridoxal phosphate]] as a cofactor.<ref name=Musacchio/> Dopamine is then converted into norepinephrine by the enzyme [[dopamine beta-monooxygenase|dopamine β-monooxygenase]] (formerly known as ''dopamine β-hydroxylase''), with O<sub>2</sub> and [[ascorbic acid]] as cofactors.<ref name=Musacchio/>

Norepinephrine itself can further be converted into [[epinephrine]] by the enzyme [[phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase|phenylethanolamine ''N''-methyltransferase]] with [[S-Adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl-<small>L</small>-methionine]] as cofactor.<ref name=Musacchio/>

=== Degradation ===

In mammals, norepinephrine is rapidly degraded to various [[metabolite]]s. The initial step in the breakdown can be catalyzed by either of the enzymes [[monoamine oxidase]] (mainly [[monoamine oxidase A]]) or [[catechol-O-methyl transferase|COMT]].<ref name="Foye's">{{cite book | editor-last3 = Zito | editor-first3 = S.

The principal end products are either [[Vanillylmandelic acid]] or a conjugated form of [[3-Methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethylene glycol|MHPG]], both of which are thought to be biologically inactive and are excreted in the urine.<ref name=Rang&Dale>{{cite book | chapter = Chapter 14: Noradrenergic transmission | vauthors = Rang HP, Ritter JM, Flower R, Henderson G | title = Rang & Dale's Pharmacology | publisher = Elsevier Health Sciences | year = 2014 | pages = 177–196 | isbn = 978-0-7020-5497-6 }}</ref>

Like many other biologically active substances, norepinephrine exerts its effects by binding to and activating [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] located on the surface of cells. Two broad families of norepinephrine receptors have been identified, known as alpha and beta adrenergic receptors.<ref name=Rang&Dale/>  Alpha receptors are divided into subtypes [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>]] and [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>2</sub>]]; beta receptors into subtypes [[Beta-1 adrenergic receptor|β<sub>1</sub>]], [[Beta-2 adrenergic receptor|β<sub>2</sub>]], and [[Beta-3 adrenergic receptor|β<sub>3</sub>]].<ref name=Rang&Dale/> All of these function as [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s, meaning that they exert their effects via a complex [[second messenger system]].<ref name=Rang&Dale/> Alpha-2 receptors usually have inhibitory effects, but many are located pre-synaptically (i.e., on the surface of the cells that release norepinephrine), so the net effect of alpha-2 activation is often a decrease in the amount of norepinephrine released.<ref name=Rang&Dale/>  Alpha-1 receptors and all three types of beta receptors usually have excitatory effects.<ref name=Rang&Dale/>

====Storage, release, and reuptake====

[[File:Synapse noradrenergique1.png|thumb|right|400px|Norepinephrine (labeled "noradrenaline" in this drawing) processing in a synapse.  After release norepinephrine can either be taken up again by the presynaptic terminal, or broken down by enzymes.|alt=Cartoon diagram of a noradrenergic synapse, showing the synthetic and metabolic mechanisms as well as the things that can happen after release.]]
Inside the brain norepinephrine functions as a [[neurotransmitter]], and is controlled by a set of mechanisms common to all [[monoamine neurotransmitter]]s. After synthesis, norepinephrine is transported from the [[cytosol]] into [[vesicle (biology and chemistry)|synaptic vesicles]] by the [[vesicular monoamine transporter]] (VMAT).<ref name=Eiden>{{cite journal | vauthors = Eiden LE, Schäfer MK, Weihe E, Schütz B | title = The vesicular amine transporter family (SLC18): amine/proton antiporters required for vesicular accumulation and regulated exocytotic secretion of monoamines and acetylcholine | journal = Pflugers Arch. | volume = 447 | issue = 5 | pages = 636–40  | year=2004 | pmid = 12827358 | doi = 10.1007/s00424-003-1100-5 }}</ref> Norepinephrine is stored in these vesicles until it is ejected into the [[chemical synapse|synaptic cleft]], typically after an [[action potential]] causes the vesicles to release their contents directly into the [[chemical synapse|synaptic cleft]] through a process called [[exocytosis]].<ref name=Rang&Dale/>

Once in the synapse, norepinephrine binds to and activates receptors.  After an action potential, the norepinephrine molecules quickly become unbound from their receptors. They are then absorbed back into the presynaptic cell, via [[reuptake]] mediated primarily by the [[norepinephrine transporter]] (NET).<ref name=Torres>{{cite journal | vauthors=Torres GE, Gainetdinov RR, Caron MG | title=Plasma membrane monoamine transporters: structure, regulation and function | journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume=4 | issue=1 | pages=13–25 | year=2003 | pmid =12511858 | doi=10.1038/nrn1008 }}</ref> Once back in the cytosol, norepinephrine can either be broken down by [[monoamine oxidase]] or repackaged into vesicles by VMAT, making it available for future release.<ref name=Eiden/>

=== Sympathetic nervous system ===
{{main article|Sympathetic nervous system}}
[[File:Blausen 0838 Sympathetic Innervation.png|thumb|400px|Schema of the sympathetic nervous system, showing the sympathetic ganglia and the parts of the body to which they connect.]]
Norepinephrine is the main neurotransmitter used by the sympathetic nervous system, which consists of about two dozen [[sympathetic chain ganglia]] located next to the spinal cord, plus a set of [[prevertebral ganglia]] located in the chest and abdomen.<ref name=Hamill>{{cite book |title=Primer on the Autonomic Nervous System |chapter=Peripheral Autonomic Nervous System| authors=Hamill RW, Shapiro RE, Vizzard MA |editors=Robertson D, Biaggioni I, ''et al.'' |publisher=Academic Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-12-386525-0 |pages=17–20}}</ref>  These sympathetic ganglia are connected to numerous organs, including the eyes, salivary glands, heart, lungs, liver, gallbladder, stomach, intestines, kidneys, urinary bladder, reproductive organs, muscles, skin, and adrenal glands.<ref name=Hamill/>  Sympathetic activation of the adrenal glands causes the part called the [[adrenal medulla]] to release norepinephrine into the bloodstream, from which, functioning as a [[hormone]], it gains further access to a wide variety of tissues.<ref name=Hamill/>

Broadly speaking, the effect of norepinephrine on each target organ is to modify its state in a way that makes it more conducive to active body movement, often at a cost of increased energy use and increased wear and tear.<ref name=Schacter>{{cite book|title=Psychology: European Edition |authors=Schacter D, Gilbert D, Wegner D, Hood B |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-230-34367-2 |page=93}}</ref>  This can be contrasted with the [[acetylcholine]]-mediated effects of the [[parasympathetic nervous system]], which modifies most of the same organs into a state more conducive to rest, recovery, and digestion of food, and usually less costly in terms of energy expenditure.<ref name=Schacter/>

The sympathetic effects of norepinephrine include:
* In the eyes, an increase in production of tears, making the eyes more moist.,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dartt DA | title = Neural regulation of lacrimal gland secretory processes: relevance in dry eye diseases | journal = Progress in Retinal and Eye Research | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 155–77 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19376264 | pmc = 3652637 | doi = 10.1016/j.preteyeres.2009.04.003 }}</ref> and [[mydriasis|pupil dilation]] through contraction of the [[iris dilator]].

* Multiple effects on the [[immune system]].  The sympathetic nervous system is the primary path of interaction between the immune system and the brain, and several components receive sympathetic inputs, including the [[thymus]], [[spleen]], and [[lymph node]]s.  However the effects are complex, with some immune processes activated while others are inhibited.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kenney MJ, Ganta CK | title = Autonomic nervous system and immune system interactions | journal = Comprehensive Physiology | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 1177–200 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24944034 | pmc = 4374437 | doi = 10.1002/cphy.c130051 }}</ref>

* In the [[stomach]] and intestines, a reduction in digestive activity.  This results from a generally inhibitory effect of norepinephrine on the [[enteric nervous system]], causing decreases in gastrointestinal mobility, blood flow, and secretion of digestive substances.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Konturek SJ, Konturek JW, Pawlik T, Brzozowski T |title=Brain-gut axis and its role in the control of food intake |journal=J.

=== Central nervous system ===

[[File:Noradrenergic neurons.png|thumb|Brain areas containing noradrenergic neurons.]]
The noradrenergic neurons in the brain form a [[neurotransmitter system]], that, when activated, exerts effects on large areas of the brain. The effects are manifested in alertness, [[arousal]], and readiness for action.

[[Noradrenergic]] neurons (i.e., neurons whose primary neurotransmitter is norepinephrine) are comparatively few in number, and their cell bodies are confined to a few relatively small brain areas, but they send projections to many other brain areas and exert powerful effects on their targets.  These [[noradrenergic cell groups]] were first mapped in 1964 by Annica Dahlström and Kjell Fuxe, who assigned them labels starting with the letter "A" (for "aminergic").<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dahlstroem A, Fuxe K | title = Evidence for the existence of monoamine-containing neurons in the central nervous system.

Supplementum | volume = 232 | issue = Supplement 232 | pages = 1–55 | year = 1964 | pmid = 14229500 }}</ref>  In their scheme, areas A1 through A7 contain the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (A8 through A14 contain [[dopamine]]).  [[Noradrenergic cell group A1]] is located in the caudal ventrolateral part of the medulla, and plays a role in the control of body fluid metabolism.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Antunes-Rodrigues J, de Castro M, Elias LL, Valença MM, McCann SM | title = Neuroendocrine control of body fluid metabolism | journal = Physiological Reviews | volume = 84 | issue = 1 | pages = 169–208 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14715914 | doi = 10.1152/physrev.00017.2003 | url = http://physrev.physiology.org/content/84/1/169.long }}</ref> [[Noradrenergic cell group A2]] is located in a brainstem area called the [[solitary nucleus]]; these cells have been implicated in a variety of responses, including control of food intake and responses to stress.<ref name=Rinaman>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rinaman L | title = Hindbrain noradrenergic A2 neurons: diverse roles in autonomic, endocrine, cognitive, and behavioral functions | journal = American Journal of Physiology.

The most important source of norepinephrine in the brain is the [[locus coeruleus]], which contains [[noradrenergic cell group A6]] and adjoins cell group [[Noradrenergic cell group A4|A4]].  The locus coeruleus is quite small in absolute terms—in primates it is estimated to contain around 15,000 neurons, less than one millionth of the neurons in the brain—but it sends projections to every major part of the brain and also to the spinal cord.<ref name=SaraNeuron>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sara SJ, Bouret S |title=Orienting and reorienting: the locus coeruleus mediates cognition through arousal |journal=Neuron |volume=76 |issue=1 |pages=130–41 |year=2012 |pmid=23040811 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2012.09.011 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627312008197}}</ref>

The level of activity in the locus coeruleus correlates broadly with vigilance and speed of reaction.  LC activity is low during sleep and drops to virtually nothing during the REM (dreaming) state.<ref name=Berridge>{{cite journal |vauthors=Berridge CW, Schmeichel BE, España RA |title=Noradrenergic modulation of wakefulness/arousal |journal=Sleep Med Rev |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=187–97 |year=2012 |pmid=22296742 |pmc=3278579 |doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2011.12.003 |url=}}</ref>  It runs at a baseline level during wakefulness, but increases temporarily when a person is presented with any sort of stimulus that draws attention.  Unpleasant stimuli such as pain, difficulty breathing, bladder distension, heat or cold generate larger increases.  Extremely unpleasant states such as intense fear or intense pain are associated with very high levels of LC activity.<ref name=SaraNeuron/>

Norepinephrine released by the locus coeruleus affects brain function in a number of ways.  It enhances processing of sensory inputs, enhances attention, enhances formation and retrieval of both long term and working memory, and enhances the ability of the brain to respond to inputs by changing the activity pattern in the prefrontal cortex and other areas.<ref name=Sara>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sara SJ |title=Locus Coeruleus in time with the making of memories |journal=Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. |volume=35 |issue= |pages=87–94 |year=2015 |pmid=26241632 |doi=10.1016/j.conb.2015.07.004 |url=}}</ref>  The control of arousal level is strong enough that drug-induced suppression of the LC has a powerful sedating effect.<ref name=Berridge/>

There is great similarity between situations that activate the locus coeruleus in the brain and situations that activate the sympathetic nervous system in the periphery:  the LC essentially mobilizes the brain for action while the sympathetic system mobilizes the body.  It has been argued that this similarity arises because both are to a large degree controlled by the same brain structures, particularly a part of the brainstem called the [[nucleus gigantocellularis]].<ref name=SaraNeuron/>

==Pharmacology==

A large number of important drugs exert their effects by interacting with norepinephrine systems in the brain or body.  Their uses include treatment of cardiovascular problems, shock, and a variety of psychiatric conditions.

===Sympathomimetic and sympatholytic drugs===

[[Sympathomimetic drug]]s mimic or enhance at least some of the effects of norepinephrine released by the sympathetic nervous system; [[sympatholytic]] drugs, in contrast, block at least some of the effects.<ref name=Gardenhire>{{cite book |title=Rau's Respiratory Care Pharmacology |author=Gardenhire DS |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-323-27714-3 |page=88}}</ref>  Both of these are large groups with diverse uses, depending on exactly which effects are enhanced or blocked.<ref name=Gardenhire/>  [[Norepinephrine (medication)|Norepinephrine]] itself is classified as a sympathomimetic drug:  its effects when given by intravenous injection of increasing heart rate and force and constricting blood vessels make it very useful for treating medical emergencies that involve critically low blood pressure.<ref name=Gardenhire/>

===Beta blockers===
{{main article|Beta blocker}}

These are drugs that block the effects of beta noradrenergic receptors while having little or no effect on alpha receptors.  They are sometimes used to treat [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[atrial fibrillation]] and [[congestive heart failure]], but recent reviews have concluded that other types of drugs are usually superior for those purposes.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal |vauthors=Deedwania PC |title=Management of Patients With Stable Angina and Type 2 Diabetes |journal=Rev Cardiovasc Med |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=105–13 |year=2015 |pmid=26198557 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mareev Y, Cleland JG |title=Should β-Blockers Be Used in Patients With Heart Failure and Atrial Fibrillation? |journal=Clin Ther |volume= 37|issue= |pages= 2215–24|year=2015 |pmid=26391145 |doi=10.1016/j.clinthera.2015.08.017 |url=}}</ref>  Beta blockers may be a viable choice for other cardiovascular conditions, though, including [[angina]] and [[Marfan syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kumar A, Agarwal S |title=Marfan syndrome: An eyesight of syndrome |journal=Meta Gene |volume=2 |issue= |pages=96–105 |year=2014 |pmid=25606393 |pmc=4287801 |doi=10.1016/j.mgene.2013.10.008 |url=}}</ref>  They are also widely used to treat [[glaucoma]], either in pill form or in eyedrops.<ref name=Inoue>{{cite journal |vauthors=Inoue K |title=Managing adverse effects of glaucoma medications |journal=Clin Ophthalmol |volume=8 |issue= |pages=903–13 |year=2014 |pmid=24872675 |pmc=4025938 |doi=10.2147/OPTH.S44708 |url=}}</ref>  Because of their effects in reducing anxiety symptoms and tremor, they have sometimes been used by entertainers, public speakers and athletes to reduce [[performance anxiety]], although they are not medically approved for that purpose and are banned by the [[International Olympic Committee]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Brugués AO |title=Music performance anxiety-part 2. a review of treatment options |journal=Med Probl Perform Art |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=164–71 |year=2011 |pmid=21987072 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fitch K |title=Proscribed drugs at the Olympic Games: permitted use and misuse (doping) by athletes |journal=Clin Med |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=257–60 |year=2012 |pmid=22783779 |doi= 10.7861/clinmedicine.12-3-257|url=}}</ref>

===Alpha blockers===
{{main article|Alpha blocker}}

These are drugs that block the effects of noradrenergic alpha receptors while having little or no effect on beta receptors.<ref name=Lilley>{{cite book |title=Pharmacology and the Nursing Process, 7th edition |authors=Lilley LL, Collins SR, Snyder JS |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |year=2014| isbn=978-0-323-29361-7 |pages=313–316}}</ref>  Drugs belonging to this group can have very different effects, however, depending on whether they primarily block alpha-1 receptors, alpha-2 receptors, or both.  Alpha-2 receptors, as described elsewhere in this article, are frequently located on norepinephrine-releasing neurons themselves and have inhibitory effects on them; consequently blockage of alpha-2 receptors usually results in an increase in norepinephrine release.<ref name=Lilley/>  Alpha-1 receptors are usually located on target cells and have excitatory effects on them; consequently blockage of alpha-1 receptors usually results in blocking some of the effects of norepinephrine.<ref name=Lilley/>  Drugs such as [[phentolamine]] that act on both types of receptors can produce a complex combination of both effects. In most cases when the term "alpha blocker" is used without qualification, it refers to a selective alpha-1 antagonist.

Selective [[alpha-1 blocker]]s have a variety of uses.  Because one of their effects is to relax the muscles in the neck of the bladder, they are often used to treat [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]], and to help with the expulsion of [[bladder stone]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Campschroer T, Zhu Y, Duijvesz D, Grobbee DE, Lock MT |title=Alpha-blockers as medical expulsive therapy for ureteral stones |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=4 |issue= |pages=CD008509 |year=2014 |pmid=24691989 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008509.pub2 |url=}}</ref> Their effects on the central nervous system make them useful for treating [[generalized anxiety disorder]], [[panic disorder]], and [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Green B |title=Prazosin in the treatment of PTSD |journal=J Psychiatr Pract |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=253–9 |year=2014 |pmid=25036580 |doi=10.1097/01.pra.0000452561.98286.1e |url=}}</ref> They may, however, have significant side-effects, including a drop in blood pressure.<ref name=Lilley/>

Some antidepressants function partly as selective [[alpha-2 blocker]]s, but the best-known drug in that class is [[yohimbine]], which is extracted from the bark of the African [[Pausinystalia yohimbe|yohimbe]] tree.<ref name=Corazza>{{cite journal |vauthors=Corazza O, Martinotti G, Santacroce R, Chillemi E, Di Giannantonio M, Schifano F, Cellek S |title=Sexual enhancement products for sale online: raising awareness of the psychoactive effects of yohimbine, maca, horny goat weed, and Ginkgo biloba |journal=Biomed Res Int |volume=2014 |issue= |pages=841798 |year=2014 |pmid=25025070 |pmc=4082836 |doi=10.1155/2014/841798 |url=}}</ref>  Yohimbine acts as a [[erectile dysfunction|male potency enhancer]], but its usefulness for that purpose is limited by serious side-effects including anxiety and insomnia.<ref name=Corazza/>  Overdoses can cause a dangerous increase in blood pressure.<ref name=Corazza/>  Yohimbine is banned in many countries, but in the United States, because it is extracted from a plant rather than chemically synthesized, it is sold [[over the counter]] as a [[nutritional supplement]].<ref name=EFSA>{{cite journal |journal=EFSA Journal |year=2013 |volume=11 |issue=7 |page=3302 |title=Scientific Opinion on the evaluation of the safety in use of Yohimbe |url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/scientific_output/files/main_documents/3302.pdf |authors=EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources Added to Food}}</ref>

===Alpha-2 agonists===

These are drugs that activate alpha-2 receptors or enhance their effects.  Because alpha-2 receptors are inhibitory and many are located presynaptically on norepinephrine-releasing cells, the net effect of these drugs is usually to reduce the amount of norepinephrine released.<ref name=Lemke>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lemke KA |title=Perioperative use of selective alpha-2 agonists and antagonists in small animals |journal=Can.

J. |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=475–80 |year=2004 |pmid=15283516 |pmc=548630}}</ref>  Drugs in this group that are capable of entering the brain often have strong sedating effects, due to their inhibitory effects on the [[locus coeruleus]].<ref name=Lemke/>  [[Clonidine]], for example, is used for the treatment of anxiety disorders and insomnia, and also as a sedative [[premedication]] for patients about to undergo surgery.<ref name=Belkin>{{cite journal |vauthors=Belkin MR, Schwartz TL |title=Alpha-2 receptor agonists for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder |journal=Drugs Context |volume=4 |issue= |pages=212286 |year=2015 |pmid=26322115 |pmc=4544272 |doi=10.7573/dic.212286 |url=}}</ref>  [[Xylazine]], another drug in this group, is also a powerful sedative and is often used in combination with [[ketamine]] as a [[general anaesthesia|general anaesthetic]] for [[veterinary surgery]]—in the United States it has not been approved for use in humans.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Greene SA, Thurmon JC |title=Xylazine—a review of its pharmacology and use in veterinary medicine |journal=J.

===Stimulants and antidepressants===
{{See also|Stimulant#Mechanisms of action|Antidepressant#Pharmacology}}
These are drugs whose primary effects are thought to be mediated by different neurotransmitter systems ([[dopamine]] for [[stimulant]]s, [[serotonin]] for [[antidepressant]]s), but many also increase levels of norepinephrine in the brain.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} [[Amphetamine]], for example, is a stimulant that increases release of norepinephrine as well as dopamine.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Heal |first1=David J. |last2=Smith |first2=Sharon L. |last3=Gosden |first3=Jane |last4=Nutt |first4=David J. |date=June 2013 |title=Amphetamine, past and present—a pharmacological and clinical perspective |journal=Journal of Psychopharmacology |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=479–496 |doi=10.1177/0269881113482532 |pmc=3666194 |pmid=23539642 }}</ref> [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s are antidepressants that inhibit the metabolic degradation of norepinephrine as well as serotonin.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In some cases it is difficult to distinguish the norepinephrine-mediated effects from the effects related to other neurotransmitters.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Diseases and disorders==

A number of important medical problems involve dysfunction of the norepinephrine system in the brain or body.

===Sympathetic hyperactivation===

Hyperactivation of the [[sympathetic nervous system]] is not a recognized condition in itself, but it is a component of a number of conditions, as well as a possible consequence of taking [[sympathomimetic drug]]s.  It causes a distinctive set of symptoms including aches and pains, rapid heartbeat, elevated blood pressure, sweating, palpitations, anxiety, headache, paleness, and a drop in blood glucose.  If sympathetic activity is elevated for an extended time, it can cause weight loss and other stress-related body changes.

The list of conditions that can cause sympathetic hyperactivation includes severe brain injury,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lump D, Moyer M |title=Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity after severe brain injury |journal=Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep |volume=14 |issue=11 |pages=494 |year=2014 |pmid=25220846 |doi=10.1007/s11910-014-0494-0 |url=}}</ref> spinal cord damage,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Amzallag M |title=Autonomic hyperreflexia |journal=Int Anesthesiol Clin |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=87–102 |year=1993 |pmid=8440534 |doi= 10.1097/00004311-199331010-00009|url=}}</ref> heart failure,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=McCrink KA, Brill A, Lymperopoulos A |title=Adrenal G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 in regulation of sympathetic nervous system activity in heart failure |journal=World J Cardiol |volume=7 |issue=9 |pages=539–43 |year=2015 |pmid=26413230 |doi=10.4330/wjc.v7.i9.539 |pmc=4577680}}</ref> high blood pressure,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Malpas SC |title=Sympathetic nervous system overactivity and its role in the development of cardiovascular disease |journal=Physiol.

===Pheochromocytoma===

A [[pheochromocytoma]] is a rarely occurring tumor of the [[adrenal medulla]], caused either by genetic factors or certain types of cancer.  The consequence is a massive increase in the amount of norepinephrine and epinephrine released into the bloodstream.  The most obvious symptoms are those of sympathetic hyperactivation, including particularly a rise in blood pressure that can reach fatal levels.  The most effective treatment is surgical removal of the tumor.

===Stress===

[[Stress (biology)|Stress]], to a physiologist, means any situation that threatens the continued stability of the body and its functions.<ref name=Chrousos>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chrousos GP |title=Stress and disorders of the stress system |journal=Nat Rev Endocrinol |volume=5 |issue=7 |pages=374–81 |year=2009 |pmid=19488073 |doi=10.1038/nrendo.2009.106 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/George_Chrousos/publication/26258826_Stress_and_disorders_of_the_stress_system/links/09e4150f0899bf1a02000000.pdf}}</ref> Stress affects a wide variety of body systems:  the two most consistently activated are the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] and the norepinephrine system, including both the [[sympathetic nervous system]] and the [[locus coeruleus]]-centered system in the brain.<ref name=Chrousos/>  Stressors of many types evoke increases in noradrenergic activity, which mobilizes the brain and body to meet the threat.<ref name=Chrousos/>  Chronic stress, if continued for a long time, can damage many parts of the body.  A significant part of the damage is due to the effects of sustained norepinephrine release, because of norepinephrine's general function of directing resources away from maintenance, regeneration, and reproduction, and toward systems that are required for active movement.  The consequences can include slowing of growth (in children), sleeplessness, loss of libido, gastrointestinal problems, impaired disease resistance, slower rates of injury healing, depression, and increased vulnerability to addiction.<ref name=Chrousos/>

===ADHD===

[[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] is a psychiatric condition involving problems with attention, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness.<ref name=Kooij>{{cite journal |authors= Kooij SJ, Bejerot S | title = European consensus statement on diagnosis and treatment of adult ADHD: The European Network Adult ADHD | journal = BMC Psychiatry | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 67 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20815868 | pmc = 2942810 | doi = 10.1186/1471-244X-10-67 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> It is most commonly treated using [[stimulant]] drugs such as [[methylphenidate]] (Ritalin), whose primary effect is to increase [[dopamine]] levels in the brain, but drugs in this group also generally increase brain levels of norepinephrine, and it has been difficult to determine whether these actions are involved in their clinical value.  Also there is substantial evidence that many people with ADHD show "biomarkers" involving altered norepinephrine processing.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Faraone SV, Bonvicini C, Scassellati C |title=Biomarkers in the diagnosis of ADHD--promising directions |journal=Curr Psychiatry Rep |volume=16 |issue=11 |pages=497 |year=2014 |pmid=25298126 |doi=10.1007/s11920-014-0497-1 |url=}}</ref> Several drugs whose primary effects are on norepinephrine, including [[guanfacine]], [[clonidine]], and [[atomoxetine]], have been tried as treatments for ADHD, and found to have effects comparable to those of stimulants.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bello NT |title=Clinical utility of guanfacine extended release in the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents |journal=Patient Prefer Adherence |volume=9 |issue= |pages=877–85 |year=2015 |pmid=26170637 |pmc=4494608 |doi=10.2147/PPA.S73167 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Clemow DB, Bushe CJ |title=Atomoxetine in patients with ADHD: A clinical and pharmacological review of the onset, trajectory, duration of response and implications for patients |journal=J.

===Autonomic failure===

Several conditions, including [[Parkinson's disease]], [[diabetes]] and so-called [[pure autonomic failure]], can cause a loss of norepinephrine-secreting neurons in the sympathetic nervous system.  The symptoms are widespread, the most serious being a reduction in heart rate and an extreme drop in resting blood pressure, making it impossible for severely affected people to stand for more than a few seconds without fainting.  Treatment can involve dietary changes or drugs.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Shibao C, Okamoto L, Biaggioni I |title=Pharmacotherapy of autonomic failure |journal=Pharmacol.

==History==
{{main article|History of catecholamine research}}

Early in the twentieth century [[Walter Bradford Cannon|Walter Cannon]], who had popularized the idea of a [[sympathoadrenal system]] preparing the body for [[Fight-or-flight response|fight and flight]], and his colleague [[Arturo Rosenblueth]] developed a theory of two ''sympathins'', ''sympathin E'' (excitatory) and ''sympathin I'' (inhibitory), responsible for these actions.<ref name=Bacq/> The Belgian pharmacologist [[Zénon Bacq]] as well as Canadian and US-American pharmacologists between 1934 and 1938 suggested that noradrenaline might be a sympathetic transmitter.<ref name=Bacq>{{cite book |author=Bacq ZM |chapter=Chemical transmission of nerve impulses |editors=Parnham MJ, Bruinvels J |title=Discoveries in Pharmacology, Volume 1 |location=Amsterdam |publisher=Elsevier |year=1983 |pages=49–103 |isbn=0-444-80493-5}}</ref> In 1939, Hermann Blaschko and Peter Holtz independently identified the biosynthetic mechanism for norepinephrine in the vertebrate body.<ref name="Blaschko1987">{{cite journal | author = Herman Blaschko|year = 1987|title = A half-century of research on catecholamine biosynthesis|journal=Journal of Applied Cardiology|volume = |pages = 171–183}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author =P.
