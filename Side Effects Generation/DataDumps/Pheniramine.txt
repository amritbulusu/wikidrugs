'''Pheniramine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], trade name '''Avil''', among others) is an [[antihistamine]] with [[anticholinergic]] properties used to treat [[allergy|allergic]] conditions such as [[hay fever]] or [[urticaria]]. It has relatively strong sedative effects, and may sometimes be used off-label as an over-the-counter sleeping pill in a similar manner to other sedating antihistamines such as [[diphenhydramine]]. Pheniramine is also commonly found in [[eyedrops]] used for the treatment of [[allergic conjunctivitis]].

Pheniramine is generally sold in combination with other medications, rather than as a stand-alone drug, although some formulations are available containing pheniramine by itself. As an example, [[TheraFlu]]/Neo Citran contains pheniramine.

==Chemical relatives==
[[Halogenation]] of pheniramine increases its potency 20-fold. Halogenated derivatives of pheniramine include [[chlorphenamine]], [[brompheniramine]], [[dexchlorpheniramine]], [[dexbrompheniramine]], and [[zimelidine]]. Two other halogenated derivatives, [[fluorpheniramine]] and [[iodopheniramine]], are currently in use for research on combination therapies for malaria and some cancers.

Other analogs include [[triprolidine]]. Similar molecules include [[diphenhydramine]], [[doxylamine]], and [[tripelennamine]].

==Side effects==
Pheniramine may cause drowsiness or [[bradycardia]], and over-dosage may lead to sleep disorders.

Overdose may lead to [[seizures]], especially in combination with alcohol.

People combining with [[cortisol]] in the long term should avoid pheniramine as it may decrease levels of adrenaline (epinephrine) which may lead to loss of consciousness.

Pheniramine is a [[deliriant]] (hallucinogen) in toxic doses. Recreational use of Robitussin for the [[dissociative]] (hallucinogenic) effect of its dextromethorphan is hazardous because it also contains chlorpheniramine.
