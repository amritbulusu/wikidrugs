== Molecular mechanism ==
Fasudil (HA-1077) is a selective RhoA/[[Rho-associated protein kinase|Rho kinase]] (ROCK) inhibitor.<ref name="Nagumo_2000">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nagumo H, Sasaki Y, Ono Y, Okamoto H, Seto M, Takuwa Y | title = Rho kinase inhibitor HA-1077 prevents Rho-mediated myosin phosphatase inhibition in smooth muscle cells | journal = American Journal of Physiology. Cell Physiology | volume = 278 | issue = 1 | pages = C57–65 | date = Jan 2000 | pmid = 10644512 }}</ref> ROCK is an enzyme that plays an important role in mediating vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling in the pathogenesis of PH. ROCK induces vasoconstriction by phosphorylating the myosin-binding subunit of myosin light chain (MLC) phosphatase, thus decreasing MLC phosphatase activity and enhancing vascular smooth muscle contraction.<ref name="Nagumo_2000"/>

=== ACE  expression ===
[[Angiotensin-converting enzyme]] (ACE) is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of [[Angiotensin#Angiotensin_I|angiotensin-I]] (Ang-I) to [[Angiotensin#Angiotensin_II|angiotensin-II]] (Ang-II). Ang-II is a peptide hormone which increases blood pressure by initiating [[vasoconstriction]] and [[aldosterone]] secretion. ROCK increases ACE expression and activity in PH. By inhibiting ROCK with fasudil, circulating ACE and Ang-II are reduced, leading to a decrease in pulmonary vascular pressure.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ocaranza MP, Rivera P, Novoa U, Pinto M, González L, Chiong M, Lavandero S, Jalil JE | title = Rho kinase inhibition activates the homologous angiotensin-converting enzyme-angiotensin-(1-9) axis in experimental hypertension | journal = Journal of Hypertension | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 706–15 | date = Apr 2011 | pmid = 21330937 | doi = 10.1097/HJH.0b013e3283440665 }}</ref>

=== eNOS expression ===
[[Endothelial nitric oxide synthase]] (eNOS) mediates the production of the vasodilator [[nitric oxide]] (NO). Pulmonary arterial cell cultures treated with fasudil showed a significant increase in eNOS mRNA levels in a dose dependent manner, and the half-life of eNOS mRNA increased 2-folds. These findings suggested that ROCK inhibition with fasudil increases eNOS expression by stabilizing eNOS mRNA, which contributed to an increase of NO level to enhance vasodilation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Takemoto M, Sun J, Hiroki J, Shimokawa H, Liao JK | title = Rho-kinase mediates hypoxia-induced downregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase | journal = Circulation | volume = 106 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–62 | date = Jul 2002 | pmid = 12093770 | doi=10.1161/01.cir.0000020682.73694.ab}}</ref>

=== ERK activation ===
The proliferative effects of ROCK on vascular endothelial cells is due to the activation of [[extracellular signal-regulated kinase]] (ERK).<ref name="Liu_2011">{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu AJ, Ling F, Wang D, Wang Q, Lü XD, Liu YL | title = Fasudil inhibits platelet-derived growth factor-induced human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation by up-regulation of p27kip¹ via the ERK signal pathway | journal = Chinese Medical Journal | volume = 124 | issue = 19 | pages = 3098–104 | date = Oct 2011 | pmid = 22040563 }}</ref> ERK mediates cell proliferation via the phosphorylation of p27Kip1, thus accelerating the degradation rate of [[CDKN1B|p27Kip1]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Delmas C, Manenti S, Boudjelal A, Peyssonnaux C, Eychène A, Darbon JM | title = The p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation triggers p27Kip1 degradation independently of CDK2/cyclin E in NIH 3T3 cells | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 276 | issue = 37 | pages = 34958–65 | date = Sep 2001 | pmid = 11418594 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.m101714200 }}</ref> p27Kip1 is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor which down-regulates cell cycle by binding cyclin-CDK complex.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fouty BW, Rodman DM | title = Mevastatin can cause G1 arrest and induce apoptosis in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells through a p27Kip1-independent pathway | journal = Circulation Research | volume = 92 | issue = 5 | pages = 501–9 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12600884 | doi = 10.1161/01.RES.0000061180.03813.0F }}</ref> Human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells treated with fasudil showed a decrease in cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner.
