'''Troparil''' (also known as '''(–)-2β-Carbomethoxy-3β-phenyltropane''', '''WIN 35,065-2''', or '''β-CPT''') is a [[stimulant]] drug used in scientific research. Troparil is a [[phenyltropane]]-based [[dopamine reuptake inhibitor]] (DRI) that is derived from [[methylecgonidine]]. Troparil is a few times more potent than [[cocaine]] as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor,<ref>{{Cite journal

The lack of an ester linkage removes the [[local anesthetic]] action from the drug, so troparil is a pure stimulant.

==Background==
The first known published synthesis of troparil and the related compound [[WIN 35428]] is by Clarke and co-workers during the 1970s.<ref>{{US patent|3813404}}</ref><ref name=Clarke/> Apparently, it was their intention to separate the stimulant actions of cocaine from its toxicity and dependence liability. Troparil is the only regular [[phenyltropane]] having a [[Norepinephrine transporter|NET]] affinity that exceeds the [[Dopamine active transporter|DAT]] affinity.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Application ==
Phenyltropanes are likely to have less abuse and dependency compared with cocaine.<ref>{{Cite journal| first1 = S.

== Legality ==

The legal status of troparil is unclear, but it may be considered a [[Federal Analog Act|controlled substance analog]] of cocaine in the [[United States]] on the grounds of its related chemical structure. The legal status of troparil and many other cocaine analogs in Canada, is dependent on if ecgonine, coca, or cocaine were derivatives of the compound, according to the wording on the entry of coca in Schedule 1 of the [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act]].<ref>http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-38.8/page-24.html#h-28</ref>
