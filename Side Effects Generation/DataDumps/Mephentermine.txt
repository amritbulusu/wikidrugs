'''Mephentermine''' is a [[cardiac stimulant]].  It was formerly used in Wyamine nasal decongestant inhalers and before that as a stimulant in psychiatry.

It has been used as a treatment for [[hypotension|low blood pressure]].<ref name="pmid14000433">{{cite journal |author=WHITTINGTON RM |title=Mephentemine Sulphate as a Hypertensive Agent in General Practice |journal=J Coll Gen Pract |volume=6 |issue= 2|pages=336–7 |date=May 1963 |pmid=14000433 |pmc=1878111 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

'''ATC Classification:''' 	C01CA11 - mephentermine ; Belongs to the class of adrenergic and dopaminergic cardiac stimulants excluding [[glycoside]]s. Used in the treatment of [[heart failure]].

==Mechanism of Action==
Mephentermine appears to act by indirect stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors causing the release of [[norepinephrine]] from its storage sites. It has a positive [[Inotrope|inotropic]] effect on the [[myocardium]]. AV conduction and refractory period of [[Atrioventricular node|AV node]] is shortened with an increase in ventricular conduction velocity. It dilates arteries and arterioles in the skeletal muscle and mesenteric vascular beds, leading to an increase in venous return.

'''Onset:''' 5–15 minutes (IM), immediate (IV).

'''Duration:''' 4 hr (IM), 30 minutes (IV).

==Indication & Dosage==
'''Maintenance of blood pressure in hypotensive states'''
Adult: 30–45&nbsp;mg as a single dose, repeated as necessary or followed by IV infusion of 0.1% mephentermine in 5% dextrose, rate and duration of administration will depend on patient's response.

'''Hypotension secondary to spinal anaesthesia in obstetric patients'''
Adult: 15&nbsp;mg as a single dose, repeat if needed.Maximum dose 30 mg.

==Caution==

===Contraindications===
Low blood pressure caused by [[phenothiazine]]s. [[Hypertension]]. [[Pheochromocytoma]].

===Special Precautions===
Patient on [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAOIs]]. 
For shock due to loss of blood or fluid, give fluid replacement therapy primarily, CVS disease, hypertension, [[hyperthyroidism]], chronic illnesses, lactation, pregnancy.

===Adverse Drug Reactions===
Drowsiness, incoherence, hallucinations, convulsions, slow heart rate (Reflex Bradycardia). Fear, anxiety, restlessness, tremor, insomnia, confusion, irritability, and psychosis. Nausea, vomiting, reduced appetite, urinary retention, dyspnea, weakness.

'''Potentially Fatal:''' AV block, CNS stimulation. Cerebral hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, ventricular arrhythmias.

===Drug Interactions===
Antagonizes effect of agents that lower blood pressure. Severe hypertension with MAOIs and possibly [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s. Additive vasoconstricting effects with [[ergot]] alkaloids, [[oxytocin]].

'''Potentially Fatal:''' Risk of abnormal heart rhythm in people undergoing anesthesia with [[cyclopropane]] and [[halothane]].
