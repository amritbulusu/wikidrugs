These include psychedelic agents, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), which are used for their ability to produce perceptual distortions at low and moderate doses. The use of these drugs is associated with the rapid development of tolerance and the absence of positive reinforcement (Chapter 6). Partial agonist effects at 5HT2A receptors are implicated in the psychedelic actions of LSD and related hallucinogens. 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), commonly called ecstasy, is an amphetamine derivative. It produces a combination of psychostimulant-like and weak LSD-like effects at low doses. Unlike LSD, MDMA is reinforcing—most likely because of its interactions with dopamine systems—and accordingly is subject to compulsive abuse. The weak psychedelic effects of MDMA appear to result from its amphetamine-like actions on the serotonin reuptake transporter, by means of which it causes transporter-dependent serotonin efflux. MDMA has been proven to produce lesions of serotonin neurons in animals and humans.}}</ref>

<!-- Definition and uses -->
'''Lysergic acid diethylamide''' ('''LSD'''), also known as '''acid''', is a [[psychedelic drug]] known for its psychological effects. This may include altered awareness of the surroundings, perceptions, and feelings as well as [[pseudohallucinations|sensations and images that seem real though they are not]].<ref name=NIH2016>{{cite web |title= What are hallucinogens? |url= https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/hallucinogens |website= National Institute of Drug Abuse |accessdate= April 24, 2016 |date= January 2016}}</ref> It is used mainly as a [[recreational drug use|recreational drug]] and for [[entheogen|spiritual reasons]]. LSD is typically either swallowed or held under the tongue.<ref name=NIH2016/> It is often sold on [[Blotting paper|blotter paper]], a sugar cube, or [[gelatin]]. It can also be injected.

<!-- Side effects and mechanism -->
LSD is not [[addictive]].<ref name=NIH2016/><ref name="pmid17105338"/> However, adverse psychiatric reactions such as [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]], [[paranoia]], and [[delusion]]s are possible.<ref name="Passie-2008">{{cite journal |vauthors= Passie T, Halpern JH, Stichtenoth DO, Emrich HM, Hintzen A |title= The Pharmacology of Lysergic Acid Diethylamide: a Review |journal= CNS Neuroscience & Therapeutics |volume= 14 |issue=4 |pages= 295–314 |year= 2008 |pmid= 19040555 |doi= 10.1111/j.1755-5949.2008.00059.x}}</ref> LSD is in the [[ergoline]] family.

<!-- History -->
LSD was first [[chemical synthesis|made]] by [[Albert Hofmann]] in Switzerland in 1938 from [[ergotamine]], a chemical from the fungus [[ergot]]. The laboratory name for the compound was the acronym for the German "Lyserg-säure-diäthylamid", followed by a sequential number: LSD-25.<ref name="tihkal" /><ref name="problem-child">Hofmann, Albert.

===Spiritual===
LSD is considered an [[entheogen]] because it can catalyze intense spiritual experiences, during which users may feel they have come into contact with a greater spiritual or cosmic order. Users sometimes report [[out of body]] experiences. In 1966, [[Timothy Leary]] established the [[League for Spiritual Discovery]] with LSD as its [[sacrament]].<ref>Alcohol and Drugs in North America: A Historical Encyclopedia, by David M.

=== Physical ===
LSD can cause [[Mydriasis|pupil dilation]], reduced [[appetite]], and wakefulness. Other physical reactions to LSD are highly variable and nonspecific, some of which may be secondary to the psychological effects of LSD. Among the reported symptoms are numbness, weakness, nausea, [[hypothermia]] or [[hyperthermia]], elevated [[blood sugar]], [[goose bumps]], heart rate increase, jaw clenching, perspiration, [[saliva]] production, [[mucus]] production, [[hyperreflexia]], and [[tremor]]s.{{mcn|date=June 2015}}

===Psychological===
The most common immediate psychological effects of LSD are [[visual hallucination]]s and [[illusion]]s (colloquially known as "[[acid trip|trips]]"), which can vary greatly depending on how much is used and how the brain responds. Trips usually start within 20–30 minutes of taking LSD by mouth (less if snorted or taken intravenously), peak three to four hours after ingestion, and last up to 12 hours. Negative experiences, referred to as "bad trips", produce intense negative emotions, such as irrational fears and anxiety, panic attacks, paranoia, rapid mood swings, [[intrusive thoughts]] of hopelessness, wanting to harm others, and [[suicidal ideation]]. It is impossible to predict when a bad trip will occur.<ref name=MedlinePlus>{{citation|title=Substance use - LSD|first=Timothy|last=Rogge|date=21 May 2014|accessdate=14 July 2016|publisher=MedlinePlus, U.S. National Library of Medicine|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000795.htm}}</ref><ref name=CESAR>{{citation|title=LSD |author=CESAR |publisher=Center for Substance Abuse Research, University of Maryland |date=29 October 2013 |accessdate=14 July 2016 |url=http://www.cesar.umd.edu/cesar/drugs/lsd.asp |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160715071823/http://www.cesar.umd.edu/cesar/drugs/lsd.asp |archivedate=July 15, 2016 |df= }}</ref> Good trips are stimulating and pleasurable, and typically involve feeling as if one is floating, disconnected from reality, feelings of joy or euphoria (sometimes called a "rush"), decreased inhibitions, and the belief that one has extreme mental clarity or superpowers.<ref name=MedlinePlus/>

=== Sensory ===
Some sensory effects may include an experience of radiant colors, objects and surfaces appearing to ripple or "breathe", colored patterns behind the closed eyelids ([[eidetic imagery]]), an altered sense of time (time seems to be stretching, repeating itself, changing speed or stopping), crawling geometric patterns overlaying walls and other objects, and morphing objects.<ref name="linton-langs">{{cite journal |author1=Linton Harriet B. |author2=Langs Robert J. | year = 1962 | title = Subjective Reactions to Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD-25) | url = http://www.maps.org/w3pb/new/1962/1962_linton_2052_1.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Arch.

LSD causes an [[animated]] sensory experience of [[sense]]s, [[emotion]]s, [[memory|memories]], time, and [[awareness]] for 6 to 14 hours, depending on dosage and tolerance. Generally beginning within 30 to 90 minutes after ingestion, the user may experience anything from subtle changes in perception to overwhelming [[cognitive shift]]s. Changes in auditory and visual perception are typical.<ref name="linton-langs" /><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Katz MM, Waskow IE, Olsson J | title = Characterizing the psychological state produced by LSD | journal = J Abnorm Psychol | volume = 73 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–14 | year = 1968 | pmid = 5639999 | doi = 10.1037/h0020114 }}</ref> Visual effects include the illusion of [[motion aftereffect|movement of static surfaces]] ("walls breathing"), [[after image]]-like trails of moving objects ("tracers"), the appearance of moving colored geometric patterns (especially with closed eyes), an intensification of colors and brightness ("sparkling"), new textures on objects, blurred vision, and shape suggestibility. Users commonly report{{Weasel inline|date=January 2015}} that the inanimate world appears to animate in an inexplicable way; for instance, objects that are static in three dimensions can seem to be moving relative to one or more additional spatial dimensions.<ref>See, ''e.g.,'' Gerald Oster's article "[http://www.maps.org/w3pb/new/1966/1966_oster_3875_1.pdf Moiré patterns and visual hallucinations]". ''Psychedelic Rev.'' No. 7 (1966): 33–40.</ref> Many of the basic visual effects resemble the [[phosphene]]s seen after applying pressure to the eye and have also been studied under the name "[[form constant]]s". The auditory effects of LSD may include [[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]]-like distortions of sounds, changes in ability to discern concurrent auditory stimuli, and a general intensification of the experience of music. Higher doses often cause intense and fundamental distortions of sensory perception such as [[synaesthesia]], the experience of additional spatial or temporal dimensions, and temporary [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]].{{mcn|date=January 2015}}

== Adverse effects ==
[[File:Rational harm assessment of drugs radar plot.svg|thumb|Addiction experts in psychiatry, chemistry, pharmacology, forensic science, epidemiology, and the police and legal services engaged in [[Delphi method|delphic analysis]] regarding 20 popular recreational drugs.

Of the 20 drugs ranked according to individual and societal harm by [[David Nutt]], LSD was third to last, approximately 1/10th as harmful as alcohol.  The most significant adverse effect was impairment of mental functioning while intoxicated.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nutt|first1=David J.|last2=King|first2=Leslie A.|last3=Phillips|first3=Lawrence D.|title=Drug harms in the UK: a multicriteria decision analysis|journal=Lancet |date=6 November 2010|volume=376|issue=9752|pages=1558–1565|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61462-6|issn=1474-547X|pmid=21036393}}</ref>

=== Mental disorders ===
LSD may trigger [[panic attack]]s or feelings of extreme anxiety, known familiarly as a "bad trip." Review studies suggest that LSD likely plays a role in precipitating the onset of acute psychosis in previously healthy individuals with an increased likelihood in individuals who have a family history of schizophrenia.<ref name="Passie-2008" /><ref name="Murray" /> There is evidence that people with severe mental illnesses like [[schizophrenia]] have a higher likelihood of experiencing adverse effects from taking LSD.<ref name="Murray">{{citation|title=What can we learn about schizophrenia from studying the human model, drug-induced psychosis?|vauthors=Murray RM, Paparelli A, Morrison PD, Marconi A, Di Forti M|journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics Part B|volume=162|issue= 7, Special Issue: Identifying the Origins of Mental Illness: A Festschrift in Honor of Ming T.

=== Flashbacks ===
{{See also|Flashback (psychology)}}

"Flashbacks" are a reported psychological phenomenon in which an individual experiences an episode of some of LSD's subjective effects after the drug has worn off, "persisting for months or years after [[hallucinogen]] use".<ref name="Halpern2003" /> Several studies have tried to determine the likelihood that a user of LSD, not suffering from known psychiatric conditions, will experience flashbacks.

[[Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder]] (HPPD) describes a post-LSD exposure syndrome in which LSD-like visual changes are not temporary and brief, as they are in flashbacks, but instead are persistent, and cause clinically significant impairment or distress. The syndrome is a [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]] diagnosis. Several scientific journal articles have described the disorder.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Abraham HD, Aldridge AM | title = Adverse consequences of lysergic acid diethylamide | journal = [[Addiction (journal)|Addiction]] | volume = 88 | issue = 10 | pages = 1327–34 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8251869 | doi = 10.1111/j.1360-0443.1993.tb02018.x }}</ref> HPPD differs from flashbacks in that it is persistent and apparently entirely visual (although mood and anxiety disorders are sometimes diagnosed in the same individuals). A recent review suggests that [[hallucinogen persisting perception disorder|HPPD]] (as defined in the DSM-IV) is uncommon and affects a distinctly vulnerable subpopulation of users.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Halpern JH, Pope HG | title = Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder: what do we know after 50 years? | journal = Drug Alcohol Depend | volume = 69 | issue = 2 | pages = 109–19 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12609692 | doi = 10.1016/S0376-8716(02)00306-X }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Halpern JH | title = Hallucinogens: an update | journal = Curr Psychiatry Rep | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = 347–54 | year = 2003 | pmid = 13678554 | doi = 10.1007/s11920-003-0067-4 }}</ref>

== Overdose ==
Reassurance in a calm, safe environment is beneficial. Agitation can be safely addressed with [[benzodiazepine]]s such as [[lorazepam]] or [[diazepam]]. [[Neuroleptic]]s such as [[haloperidol]] are recommended against because they may have adverse effects. LSD is rapidly absorbed, so activated charcoal and emptying of the stomach will be of little benefit, unless done within 30–60 minutes of ingesting an overdose of LSD. Sedation or physical restraint is rarely required, and excessive restraint may cause complications such as [[hyperthermia]] (over-heating) or [[rhabdomyolysis]].<ref name=Medscape>{{EMedicine|article|1011615|LSD Toxicity Treatment & Management|treatment}}</ref>

Massive doses require supportive care, which may include [[endotracheal intubation]] or respiratory support.<ref name=Medscape/> Overdose has been recorded at 1,000 to 7,000μg per 100ml & 2.1 to 26&nbsp;ng per ml in serum concentrations of the tartrate salt form. It is recommended that high blood pressure, [[tachycardia]] (rapid heart-beat), and hyperthermia, if present, are treated symptomatically, and that low blood pressure is treated initially with fluids and then with [[pressor]]s if necessary. Intravenous administration of [[anticoagulants]], [[vasodilators]], and [[sympatholytics]] may be useful with massive doses.<ref name=Medscape/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Klock |first1=John C. |last2=Boerner |first2=Udo |last3=Becker |first3=Charles E. |title=Coma, Hyperthermia and Bleeding Associated with Massive LSD Overdose: A Report of Eight Cases |journal=The Western Journal of Medicine |volume=120 |issue=3 |pages=183–8 |year=1974 |pmid=4816396 |pmc=1129381 }}</ref>

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
[[File:LSDaffinities.GIF|thumb|Binding affinities of LSD for various receptors. The lower the [[dissociation constant]] (K<sub>i</sub>), the more strongly LSD binds to that receptor (i.e. with higher affinity). The horizontal line represents an approximate value for human plasma concentrations of LSD, and hence, receptor affinities that are above the line are unlikely to be involved in LSD's effect. Data averaged from data from the [[Ki Database|K<sub>i</sub> Database]]]]

Most [[serotonergic psychedelic]]s are not significantly [[dopaminergic]], and LSD is therefore atypical in this regard. The agonism of the [[dopamine receptor D2|D<sub>2</sub> receptor]] by LSD may contribute to its psychoactive effects in humans.<ref name="nichols_closes_shop">{{cite journal |vauthors=Marona-Lewicka D, Thisted RA, Nichols DE | title = Distinct temporal phases in the behavioral pharmacology of LSD: Dopamine D2 receptor-mediated effects in the rat and implications for psychosis | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 180 | issue = 3 | pages = 427–435 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15723230 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1007/s00213-005-2183-9 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Nichols|first=David|title=The End of a Chemistry Era...

LSD binds to most serotonin receptor subtypes except for the [[5-HT3 receptor|5-HT<sub>3</sub>]] and [[5-HT4 receptor|5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor]]s.

[[File:Lysergide stereoisomers structural formulae v.2.png|thumb|The four possible stereoisomers of LSD. Only (+)-LSD is psychoactive.]]

LSD is a [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] compound with two [[stereocenter]]s at the [[carbon]] atoms C-5 and C-8, so that theoretically four different [[optical isomerism|optical isomers]] of LSD could exist. LSD, also called (+)-<small>D</small>-LSD, has the [[absolute configuration]] (5''R'',8''R''). The C-5 [[isomer]]s of lysergamides do not exist in nature and are not formed during the synthesis from <small>D</small>-lysergic acid. [[Retrosynthesis|Retrosynthetically]], the C-5 stereocenter could be analysed as having the same configuration of the alpha carbon of the naturally occurring amino acid L-[[tryptophan]], the precursor to all biosynthetic ergoline compounds.

However, LSD and iso-LSD, the two C-8 isomers, rapidly interconvert in the presence of [[base (chemistry)|bases]], as the alpha proton is acidic and can be [[deprotonation|deprotonated]] and reprotonated. Non-psychoactive iso-LSD which has formed during the synthesis can be separated by [[chromatography]] and can be isomerized to LSD.

Pure salts of LSD are [[triboluminescent]], emitting small flashes of white light when shaken in the dark.<ref name="tihkal" /> LSD is strongly [[fluorescent]] and will glow bluish-white under [[UV light]].

===Synthesis===
LSD is an [[ergoline]] derivative. It is commonly synthesized by reacting [[diethylamine]] with an activated form of [[lysergic acid]].

=== Dosage ===
[[File:10 strip.jpg|thumb|White on White blotters (WoW) for sublingual administration]]

</ref>

=== Reactivity and degradation ===
"LSD," writes the chemist [[Alexander Shulgin]], "is an unusually fragile molecule… As a salt, in water, cold, and free from air and light exposure, it is stable indefinitely."<ref name="tihkal" />

LSD has two [[Lability|labile]] protons at the tertiary stereogenic C5 and C8 positions, rendering these centres prone to [[epimerisation]]. The C8 proton is more labile due to the electron-withdrawing [[carboxamide]] attachment, but removal of the [[Chirality|chiral]] proton at the C5 position (which was once also an alpha proton of the parent molecule [[tryptophan]]) is assisted by the inductively withdrawing nitrogen and pi electron delocalisation with the [[indole]] ring.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

LSD also has [[enamine]]-type reactivity because of the electron-donating effects of the indole ring. Because of this, [[chlorine]] destroys LSD molecules on contact; even though chlorinated tap water contains only a slight amount of chlorine, the small quantity of compound typical to an LSD solution will likely be eliminated when dissolved in tap water.<ref name="tihkal" /> The [[covalent bond|double bond]] between the 8-position and the [[aromatic hydrocarbon|aromatic ring]], being conjugated with the indole ring, is susceptible to [[Nucleophile|nucleophilic]] attacks by water or [[alcohol]], especially in the presence of light. LSD often converts to "lumi-LSD", which is inactive in human beings.<ref name="tihkal" />

A controlled study was undertaken to determine the stability of LSD in pooled urine samples.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Li Z, McNally AJ, Wang H, Salamone SJ | title = Stability study of LSD under various storage conditions | journal = J. Anal. Toxicol. | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 520–5 | date = October 1998 | pmid = 9788528 | doi = 10.1093/jat/22.6.520 }}</ref>
The concentrations of LSD in urine samples were followed over time at various temperatures, in different types of storage containers, at various exposures to different wavelengths of light, and at varying pH values. These studies demonstrated no significant loss in LSD concentration at 25&nbsp;°C for up to four weeks. After four weeks of incubation, a 30% loss in LSD concentration at 37&nbsp;°C and up to a 40% at 45&nbsp;°C were observed. Urine fortified with LSD and stored in amber glass or nontransparent polyethylene containers showed no change in concentration under any light conditions. Stability of LSD in transparent containers under light was dependent on the distance between the light source and the samples, the wavelength of light, exposure time, and the intensity of light. After prolonged exposure to heat in alkaline pH conditions, 10 to 15% of the parent LSD epimerized to iso-LSD. Under acidic conditions, less than 5% of the LSD was converted to iso-LSD. It was also demonstrated that trace amounts of metal ions in buffer or urine could catalyze the decomposition of LSD and that this process can be avoided by the addition of [[EDTA]].

=== Detection in body fluids ===
LSD may be quantified in urine as part of a [[Drug test|drug abuse testing program]], in plasma or serum to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims or in whole blood to assist in a forensic investigation of a traffic or other criminal violation or a case of sudden death. Both the parent drug and its major metabolite are unstable in biofluids when exposed to light, heat or alkaline conditions and therefore specimens are protected from light, stored at the lowest possible temperature and analyzed quickly to minimize losses.<ref>R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 871–874.</ref>

The apparent plasma half life of LSD is considered to be around 5.1 hours with peak plasma concentrations occurring 3 hours after administration.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=2374410 | doi=10.1093/jat/14.3.189 | volume=14 | title=Measurement of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in human plasma by gas chromatography/negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry | year=1990 |vauthors=Papac DI, Foltz RL | journal=J Anal Toxicol | pages=189–90}}</ref>

Beginning in the 1950s, the US [[Central Intelligence Agency]] began a research program code named [[Project MKULTRA]]. Experiments included administering LSD to CIA employees, military personnel, doctors, other government agents, prostitutes, mentally ill patients, and members of the general public in order to study their reactions, usually without the subjects' knowledge. The project was revealed in the US congressional [[United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States|Rockefeller Commission report]] in 1975.

In 1963, the Sandoz patents expired on LSD.<ref name="henderson-glass"/> Several figures, including [[Aldous Huxley]], [[Timothy Leary]], and [[Alfred Matthew Hubbard|Al Hubbard]], began to advocate the consumption of LSD.

In San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, brothers Ron and Jay Thelin opened the Psychedelic Shop in January 1966. The Thelins' store is regarded as the first ever [[head shop]]. The Thelins opened the store to promote safe use of LSD, which was then still legal in California.  The Psychedelic Shop helped to further popularize LSD in the Haight and to make the neighborhood the unofficial capital of the hippie counterculture in the United States.  Ron Thelin was also involved in organizing the Love Pageant rally, a protest held in Golden Gate park to protest California's newly adopted ban on LSD in October 1966. At the rally, hundreds of attendees took acid in unison. Although the Psychedelic Shop closed after barely a year-and-a-half in business, its role in popularizing LSD was considerable.<ref>Joshua Clark Davis, The Business of Getting High: Head Shops, Countercultural Capitalism, and the Marijuana Legalization Movement.

[[File:Lysergic Acid Diethylamide.ogg|thumb|right|Lysergic Acid Diethylamide, by Lambert P. Lambert and the Gorgettes, from the album Abbra Cadaver, 1967.]]A similar and connected nexus of LSD use in the creative arts developed around the same time in [[London]]. A key figure in this phenomenon in the UK was British academic [[Michael Hollingshead]], who first tried LSD in America in 1961 while he was the Executive Secretary for the Institute of British-American Cultural Exchange. After being given a large quantity of pure Sandoz LSD (which was still legal at the time) and experiencing his first "trip", Hollingshead contacted [[Aldous Huxley]], who suggested that he get in touch with Harvard academic [[Timothy Leary]], and over the next few years, in concert with Leary and [[Richard Alpert]], Hollingshead played a major role in their famous LSD research at [[Millbrook New York|Millbrook]] before moving to New York City, where he conducted his own LSD experiments. In 1965 Hollingshead returned to the UK and founded the World Psychedelic Center in [[Chelsea, London]]. Among the many famous people in the UK that Hollingshead is reputed to have introduced to LSD are artist and [[Hipgnosis]] founder [[Storm Thorgerson]], and musicians [[Donovan]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[John Lennon]], and [[George Harrison]]. Although establishment concern about the new drug led to it being declared an illegal drug by the Home Secretary in 1966, LSD was soon being used widely in the upper echelons of the British art and music scene, including members of [[the Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[the Moody Blues]], [[the Small Faces]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Jimi Hendrix]] and others, and the products of these experiences were soon being both heard and seen by the public with singles like The Small Faces' "[[Itchycoo Park]]" and LPs like the Beatles' ''[[Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' and Cream's ''[[Disraeli Gears]]'', which featured music that showed the obvious influence of the musicians' recent psychedelic excursions, and which were packaged in elaborately-designed album covers that featured vividly-coloured psychedelic artwork by artists like [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], [[Martin Sharp]], [[Hapshash and the Coloured Coat]] ([[Nigel Waymouth]] and [[Michael English (illustrator)|Michael English]]) and art/music collective "[[The Fool (design collective)|The Fool]]".

In the 1960s, musicians from [[psychedelic music]] and [[psychedelic rock]] bands began to refer (at first indirectly, and later explicitly) to the drug and attempted to recreate or reflect the experience of taking LSD in their music. A number of features are often included in psychedelic music. Exotic instrumentation, with a particular fondness for the [[sitar]] and [[tabla]] are common.<ref>R. Rubin and J. P.

LSD had a strong influence on the [[Grateful Dead]] and the culture of [[Deadhead]]s, as well as the impact for artist [[Keith Haring]], early [[techno]] music, and the [[jam band]] [[Phish]].<ref name=Jarnow/>

=== Legal status ===
The [[United Nations]] [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]] (adopted in 1971) requires the signing parties to prohibit LSD. Hence, it is illegal in all countries that were parties to the convention, including the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and most of [[Europe]]. However, enforcement of those laws varies from country to country. Medical and scientific research with LSD in humans is permitted under the 1971 UN Convention.<ref>UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971 [http://www.unodc.org/pdf/convention_1971_en.pdf Final act of the United Nations Conference]</ref>

==== Australia ====
LSD is a [[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons|Schedule 9]] prohibited substance in Australia under the [[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons|Poisons Standard]] (February 2017).<ref name="Poisons Standard">[https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2017L00057 Poisons Standard July 2016]</ref> A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.<ref name="Poisons Standard" />

In [[Western Australia]] section 9 of the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1981]] provides for summary trial before a magistrate for possession of less than 0.004g; section 11 provides rebuttable presumptions of intent to sell or supply if the quantity is 0.002g or more, or of possession for the purpose of trafficking if 0.01g.<ref>Misuse of Drugs Act 1981 (2015) [http://www.slp.wa.gov.au/pco/prod/FileStore.nsf/Documents/MRDocument:28280P/$FILE/Misuse%20Of%20Drugs%20Act%201981%20-%20%5B06-e0-00%5D.pdf?OpenElement Slp.wa.gov.au]</ref>

==== Canada ====
In [[Canada]], LSD is a controlled substance under Schedule III of the [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act]].<ref name="cdasa">{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-38.8/page-26.html#h-30 |title=Controlled Drugs and Substances Act |accessdate=December 15, 2013 |publisher=Canadian Department of Justice |year=1996 |author=Canadian government |work=Justice Laws |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215170432/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-38.8/page-26.html |archivedate=December 15, 2013 }}</ref> Every person who seeks to obtain the substance, without disclosing authorization to obtain such substances 30 days before obtaining another prescription from a practitioner, is guilty of an indictable offense and liable to [[imprisonment]] for a term not exceeding 3 years. Possession for purpose of trafficking is an indictable offense punishable by imprisonment for 10 years.

==== United Kingdom ====
In the United Kingdom, LSD is a Schedule 1 Class 'A' drug. This means it has no recognized legitimate uses and possession of the drug without a license is punishable with 7 years' imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine, and trafficking is punishable with life imprisonment and an unlimited fine (''see main article on drug punishments [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]]).''

In 2000, after consultation with members of the [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]]' Faculty of Substance Misuse, the UK Police Foundation issued the [[Runciman Report]] which recommended ''"the transfer of LSD from Class A to Class B"''.<ref>[http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/Library/studies/runciman/pf3.htm Drugs and the law: Report of the inquiry into the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971] London: Police Foundation, 2000, [[Runciman Report]]</ref>

In November 2009, the UK [[Transform Drug Policy Foundation]] released in the House of Commons a guidebook to the legal regulation of drugs, ''After the War on Drugs: Blueprint for Regulation'', which details options for regulated distribution and sale of LSD and other psychedelics.<ref>[http://www.tdpf.org.uk/blueprint%20download.htm After the War on Drugs: Blueprint for Regulation] Transform Drug Policy Foundation 2009</ref>

==== United States ====
LSD is Schedule I in the United States, according to the [[Controlled Substances Act]] of 1970.<ref>From {{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/concern/lsd.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 5, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005063651/http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/concern/lsd.html |archivedate=October 5, 2009 }}: ''LSD is a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act.''</ref> This means LSD is illegal to manufacture, buy, possess, process, or distribute without a license from the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA). By classifying LSD as a Schedule I substance, the DEA holds that LSD meets the following three criteria: it is deemed to have a high potential for abuse; it has no legitimate medical use in treatment; and there is a lack of accepted safety for its use under medical supervision. There are no documented deaths from chemical [[toxicity]]; most LSD deaths are a result of behavioral toxicity.<ref>{{EMedicine|article|1011615|LSD Toxicity}}</ref>

There can also be substantial discrepancies between the amount of chemical LSD that one possesses and the amount of possession with which one can be charged in the U.S. This is because LSD is almost always present in a medium (e.g. blotter or neutral liquid), and the amount that can be considered with respect to sentencing is the total mass of the drug and its medium. This discrepancy was the subject of 1995 [[United States Supreme Court]] case, ''Neal v. U.S.''<ref>{{cite court| litigants=Neal v. United States| reporter=U.S.| volume=516| opinion=284| pinpoint=| court=|year=1996| url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/94-9088.ZO.html}}, originating from U.S. v. Neal, 46 F.3d 1405 (7th Cir. 1995)</ref>

Lysergic acid and lysergic acid amide, LSD precursors, are both classified in [[Schedule III (US)|Schedule III]] of the Controlled Substances Act. [[Ergotamines|Ergotamine]] [[tartrate]], a precursor to lysergic acid, is regulated under the [[Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act]].

====Mexico====
In April 2009, the Mexican Congress approved changes in the General Health Law that decriminalized the possession of illegal drugs for immediate consumption and personal use, allowing a person to possess a moderate amount of LSD. The only restriction is that people in possession of drugs should not be within a 300-meter radius of schools, police departments, or correctional facilities. Marijuana, along with cocaine, opium, heroin, and other drugs were also decriminalized, it will not be considered as a crime as long as the dose does not exceed the limit established in the General Health Law.<ref>[http://www.elpensador.com.mx/2009/10/17/Ley-de-Narcomenudeo/ Ley de Narcomenudeo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130224127/http://www.elpensador.com.mx/2009/10/17/Ley-de-Narcomenudeo/ |date=November 30, 2010 }}, ''El Pensador'' {{es icon}}, 17 October 2009</ref> Many question this, as cocaine is as much synthesised as heroin, both are produced as extracts from plants. The law establishes very low amount thresholds and strictly defines personal dosage. For those arrested with more than the threshold allowed by the law this can result in heavy prison sentences, as they will be assumed to be small traffickers even if there are no other indications that the amount was meant for selling.<ref>[http://www.druglawreform.info/index.php?option=com_flexicontent&view=items&cid=97%3Alegislative-reform-of-drug-policies&id=220%3Amexico-the-law-against-small-scale-drug-dealing&Itemid=34&lang=en Mexico: The Law Against Small-Scale Drug Dealing.

====Czech Republic====
In the [[Czech Republic]], until 31 December 1998 only drug possession "''for other person''" (i.e. intent to sell) was criminal (apart from production, importation, exportation, offering or mediation, which was and remains criminal) while possession for personal use remained legal.<ref name="Cz expl rep" />

On 1 January 1999, an amendment of the Criminal Code, which was necessitated in order to align the Czech drug rules with the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]], became effective, criminalizing possession of "''amount larger than small''" also for personal use (Art. 187a of the Criminal Code) while possession of small amounts for personal use became a misdemeanor.<ref name="Cz expl rep">{{Citation

==== Production ====
[[File:LSDLabGlassware.jpg|thumb|Glassware seized by the DEA]]

An active dose of LSD is very minute, allowing a large number of doses to be synthesized from a comparatively small amount of raw material. Twenty five kilograms of precursor [[ergotamine]] [[tartrate]] can produce 5–6&nbsp;kg of pure crystalline LSD; this corresponds to 100&nbsp;million doses. Because the masses involved are so small, concealing and transporting illicit LSD is much easier than smuggling [[cocaine]], [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], or other illegal drugs.<ref name="DEA-pub">{{cite web|author      = DEA|year        = 2007|title       = LSD Manufacture – Illegal LSD Production|url         = https://fas.org/irp/agency/doj/dea/product/lsd/lsd-5.htm|work        = LSD in the United States|publisher   = U.S. Department of Justice Drug Enforcement Administration|archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070829023659/https://fas.org/irp/agency/doj/dea/product/lsd/lsd-5.htm|archivedate = August 29, 2007}}</ref>

Manufacturing LSD requires laboratory equipment and experience in the field of [[organic chemistry]]. It takes two to three days to produce 30 to 100 grams of pure compound. It is believed that LSD is not usually produced in large quantities, but rather in a series of small batches. This technique minimizes the loss of precursor chemicals in case a step does not work as expected.<ref name="DEA-pub" />{{Dead link|date=January 2015}}

===== Forms =====
[[File:5 LSD blotters.png|thumb|Five doses of LSD, often called a "five strip"]]

LSD is produced in crystalline form and then mixed with [[excipient]]s or redissolved for production in ingestible forms. Liquid solution is either distributed in small vials or, more commonly, sprayed onto or soaked into a distribution medium. Historically, LSD solutions were first sold on sugar cubes, but practical considerations forced a change to [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablet]] form. Appearing in 1968 as an orange tablet measuring about 6&nbsp;mm across, "Orange Sunshine" acid was the first largely available form of LSD after its possession was made illegal. [[Tim Scully]], a prominent chemist, made some of these tablets, but said that most "Sunshine" in the USA came by way of [[Ronald Stark]], who imported approximately thirty-five million doses from Europe.<ref name=Stafford1992>{{cite book | last = Stafford | first = Peter | year = 1992 | title = Psychedelics Encyclopaedia | chapter = Chapter 1 – The LSD Family | page = 62 | edition = Third Expanded | publisher = Ronin Publishing Inc | isbn = 0-914171-51-8 }}</ref>

Over a period of time, tablet dimensions, weight, shape and concentration of LSD evolved from large (4.5–8.1&nbsp;mm diameter), heavyweight (≥150&nbsp;mg), round, high concentration (90–350&nbsp;µg/tab) dosage units to small (2.0–3.5&nbsp;mm diameter) lightweight (as low as 4.7&nbsp;mg/tab), variously shaped, lower concentration (12–85&nbsp;µg/tab, average range 30–40&nbsp;µg/tab) dosage units. LSD tablet shapes have included cylinders, cones, stars, spacecraft, and heart shapes. The smallest tablets became known as "Microdots".<ref name=Laing2003>{{cite book | last = Laing | first = Richard R. |author2=Barry L. Beyerstein |author3=Jay A.

===== Modern distribution =====
LSD manufacturers and traffickers in the [[United States]] can be categorized into two groups: A few large-scale producers, and an equally limited number of small, clandestine chemists, consisting of independent producers who, operating on a comparatively limited scale, can be found throughout the country.<ref>^ Maclean, J.R.; Macdonald, D.C.; Ogden, F.; Wilby, E., "LSD-25 and mescaline as therapeutic adjuvants." In: Abramson, H., Ed., The Use of LSD in Psychotherapy and Alcoholism, Bobbs-Merrill: New York, 1967, pp. 407–426; Ditman, K.S.; Bailey, J.J., "Evaluating LSD as a psychotherapeutic agent," pp.74–80; Hoffer, A., "A program for the treatment of alcoholism: LSD, malvaria, and nicotinic acid," pp. 353–402.</ref> As a group, independent producers are of less concern to the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] than the larger groups because their product reaches only local markets.<ref>^ LSD: The Drug</ref>

Many LSD dealers and chemists describe a religious or humanitarian purpose that motivates their illicit activity. Nicholas Schou's book ''Orange Sunshine: The Brotherhood of Eternal Love and Its Quest to Spread Peace, Love, and Acid to the World'' describes one such group, the [[Brotherhood of Eternal Love]]. The group was a major American LSD trafficking group in the late 1960s and early 1970s.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schou|first1=Nicholas|title=Orange Sunshine: The Brotherhood of Eternal Love and Its Quest to Spread Peace, Love, and Acid to the World|date=2010|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books}}</ref>

In the second half of the 20th century, dealers and chemists loosely associated with the [[Grateful Dead]] like [[Owsley Stanley]],  [[Nicholas Sand]], Karen Horning, Sarah Maltzer, "Dealer McDope," and [[Leonard Pickard]] played an essential role in distributing LSD.<ref name=Jarnow>{{cite book|last1=Jarnow|first1=Jesse|title=Heads: A Biography of Psychedelic America|date=2016|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=9780306822551}}</ref>

== Research ==
A number of organizations—including [[Beckley Foundation|the Beckley Foundation]], [[Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies|MAPS]], [[Heffter Research Institute]] and the [[Albert Hofmann]] Foundation—exist to fund, encourage and coordinate research into the medicinal and spiritual uses of LSD and related psychedelics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hofmann.org/ |title=The Albert Hofmann Foundation |accessdate=September 27, 2007 |work=Hofmann Foundation }}</ref> New clinical LSD experiments in humans started in 2009 for the first time in 35 years.<ref name="new research">{{cite web|url=https://www.maps.org/research/psilo-lsd/|title=LSD & Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy for Anxiety|accessdate=October 16, 2013}}</ref> As it is illegal in many areas of the world, potential medical uses are difficult to study.<ref name=Nutt2009/>

In 2001 the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|United States Drug Enforcement Administration]] stated that LSD "produces no aphrodisiac effects, does not increase creativity, has no lasting positive effect in treating [[Alcoholism|alcoholics]] or [[criminals]], does not produce a '[[model psychosis]]', and does not generate immediate personality change."<ref>{{cite web|author=DEA Public Affairs |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/lsd/lsd-4.htm |title=DEA – Publications – LSD in the US – The Drug |publisher=Web.petabox.bibalex.org |date=November 16, 2001 |accessdate=November 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990427145322/http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/lsd/lsd-4.htm |archivedate=April 27, 1999 |df= }}</ref> More recently, experimental uses of LSD have included the treatment of alcoholism<ref name=":0">{{cite journal | author = Bogenschutz MP | title = Studying the effects of classic hallucinogens in the treatment of alcoholism: Rationale, methodology, and current research with psilocybin | journal = Current Drug Abuse Reviews | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 17–29 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23627783 | doi=10.2174/15733998113099990002}}</ref> and pain and cluster headache relief.<ref name="autogenerated295">{{cite journal |vauthors=Passie T, Halpern JH, Stichtenoth DO, Emrich HM, Hintzen A | title = The pharmacology of lysergic acid diethylamide: A review | journal = CNS Neuroscience & Therapeutics | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 295–314 | year = 2008 | pmid = 19040555 | doi = 10.1111/j.1755-5949.2008.00059.x }}</ref>

=== Psychedelic therapy ===
In the 1950s and 1960s LSD was used in psychiatry to enhance psychotherapy known as [[psychedelic therapy]]. Some psychiatrists{{who|date=January 2015}} believed LSD was especially useful at helping patients to "unblock" repressed subconscious material through other [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] methods,<ref>Cohen, S. (1959). The therapeutic potential of LSD-25. ''A Pharmacologic Approach to the Study of the Mind,'' p251–258.</ref> and also for treating alcoholism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.erowid.org/references/texts/show/1852docid1733 |title=Use of d-lysergic acid diethylamide in the treatment of alcoholism |accessdate=June 20, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hofmann.org/papers/blewett_1.html |title=Use of d-Lysergic Acid Diethylamide in the Treatment of Alcoholism |publisher=Hofmann.org |date=November 14, 2003 |accessdate=February 22, 2012}}</ref> One study concluded, "The root of the therapeutic value of the LSD experience is its potential for producing [[self-acceptance]] and self-surrender,"<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chwelos N, Blewett DB, Smith CM, Hoffer A | title = Use of d-lysergic acid diethylamide in the treatment of alcoholism | journal = Quart. J. Stud. Alcohol | volume = 20 | pages = 577–90 | year = 1959 | pmid = 13810249 }}</ref> presumably by forcing the user to face issues and problems in that individual's psyche.

Two recent reviews concluded that conclusions drawn from most of these early trials are unreliable due to serious [[Methodology|methodological]] flaws.  These include the absence of adequate [[control groups]], lack of followup, and vague criteria for [[Therapy|therapeutic]] outcome.  In many cases studies failed to convincingly demonstrate whether the drug or the therapeutic interaction was responsible for any beneficial effects.<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 20717121| year = 2010| author1 = Vollenweider| first1 = F.

* [[Jerry Garcia]] stated in a July 3, 1989 interview for [[Relix Magazine]], in response to the question "Have your feelings about LSD changed over the years?," "They haven’t changed much. My feelings about LSD are mixed. It’s something that I both fear and that I love at the same time.
