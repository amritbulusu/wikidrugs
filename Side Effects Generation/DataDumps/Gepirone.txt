'''Gepirone''' is an [[antidepressant]] and [[anxiolytic]] [[drug]] of the [[azapirone]] group that was synthesized by [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] in 1986 and has been under development for the treatment of [[depression (mood)|depression]] but has yet to be marketed.<ref name="AdisInsight">{{cite web | url = http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800000684 | title = Gepirone ER | publisher = Adis Insight}}</ref><ref name="SchatzbergNemeroff2009" /><ref name="KishiMeltzer2013">{{cite journal|last1=Kishi|first1=T.|last2=Meltzer|first2=H.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Like other azapirones, gepirone acts as a [[binding selectivity|selective]] [[partial agonist]] of the [[5-HT1A receptor|5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor]].<ref name="KishiMeltzer2013" /> Unlike its relative [[buspirone]] however, gepirone has greater [[intrinsic activity|efficacy]] in activating the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and has negligible [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for the [[D2 receptor|D<sub>2</sub> receptor]] (30- to 50-fold lower in comparison).<ref name="SchatzbergNemeroff2009">{{cite book|author1=Alan F. Schatzberg|author2=Charles B. Nemeroff|title=The American Psychiatric Publishing Textbook of Psychopharmacology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xx7iNGdV25IC&pg=PA494|year=2009|publisher=American Psychiatric Pub|isbn=978-1-58562-309-9|pages=494–}}</ref> However, similarly to buspirone, gepirone [[metabolism|metabolize]]s into [[1-(2-pyrimidinyl)piperazine]], which is known to act as a [[potency (pharmacology)|potent]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of the [[alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor]].<ref name="HalbreichMontgomery2008">{{cite book|author1=Uriel Halbreich|author2=Stuart A. Montgomery|title=Pharmacotherapy for Mood, Anxiety, and Cognitive Disorders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g9NiQh7gleEC&pg=PA375|date=1 November 2008|publisher=American Psychiatric Pub|isbn=978-1-58562-821-6|pages=375–}}</ref>

==History==
Gepirone was originally [[drug development|developed]] by Bristol-Myers Squibb, but was out-licensed to [[Fabre-Kramer]] in 1993. The FDA rejected approval for gepirone in 2004. It was submitted for the preregistration (NDA) phase again in May 2007 after adding additional information from clinical trials as the FDA required in 2004. However, in 2007 it once again failed to convince the FDA of its qualities for treating anxiety and depression. In December 2015, the FDA once again gave gepirone a negative review for depression due to concerns of efficacy.<ref name="AdisInsight" /> However, in March 2016, the FDA reversed its decision and gave gepirone ER a positive review, clearing the way for the drug to finally gain market approval in the U.S.<ref>{{cite press release | url = http://www.drugs.com/nda/travivo_160317.html | title = FDA Rules Favorably On Efficacy Of Travivo (Gepirone ER) For Treatment Of Major Depressive Disorder | date = March 17, 2016 }}</ref> As of September 2017, it is still in preregistration.<ref name="AdisInsight" />

During its development it has been called BMY 13805, MJ 13805, Org 33062, and TGFK07AD and it has had two proposed trade names: Travivo and Variza.<ref name="AdisInsight" />
