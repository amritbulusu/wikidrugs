<!-- Definition and medical uses -->
'''Penicillin''' ('''PCN''' or '''pen''') is a group of [[antibiotic]]s which include [[benzylpenicillin|penicillin G]] ([[Intravenous therapy|intravenous use]]), [[phenoxymethylpenicillin|penicillin V]] (use by mouth), [[procaine benzylpenicillin|procaine penicillin]], and [[benzathine benzylpenicillin|benzathine penicillin]] ([[Intramuscular injection|intramuscular use]]). Penicillin antibiotics were among the first medications to be effective against many [[bacterial infection]]s caused by [[staphylococcus|staphylococci]] and [[streptococcus|streptococci]]. Penicillins are still widely used today, though many types of [[bacteria]] have developed [[antibiotic resistance|resistance]] following extensive use.

<!-- Side effects and mechanism -->
About 10% of people report that they are [[allergy|allergic]] to penicillin; however, up to 90% of this group may not actually be allergic.<ref name=Al2015 /> Serious allergies only occur in about 0.03%.<ref name=Al2015>{{cite journal|last1=Gonzalez-Estrada|first1=A|last2=Radojicic|first2=C|title=Penicillin allergy: A practical guide for clinicians|journal=Cleveland Clinic journal of medicine|date=May 2015|volume=82|issue=5|pages=295–300|pmid=25973877|doi=10.3949/ccjm.82a.14111|doi-broken-date=2017-01-01}}</ref> All penicillins are [[beta-lactam antibiotic|β-lactam antibiotics]].

<!-- History and culture -->
Penicillin was discovered in 1928 by Scottish scientist [[Alexander Fleming]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Discovery and Development of Penicillin|url=http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/flemingpenicillin.html|publisher=American Chemical Society|accessdate=30 August 2015}}</ref> People began using it to treat infections in 1942.<ref>{{cite book|title=Oxford Handbook of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology|year=2009|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-103962-1|page=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5W-WBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT56}}</ref> There are several enhanced penicillin families  which are effective against additional bacteria; these include the [[antistaphylococcal penicillins]], [[aminopenicillin]]s and the [[antipseudomonal penicillins]].

== Medical uses ==
The term "penicillin" is often used generically to refer to [[benzylpenicillin]] (penicillin G, the original penicillin found in 1928), [[procaine benzylpenicillin]] (procaine penicillin), [[benzathine benzylpenicillin]] (benzathine penicillin), and [[phenoxymethylpenicillin]] (penicillin V). Procaine penicillin and benzathine penicillin have the same antibacterial activity as benzylpenicillin but act for a longer period of time. Phenoxymethylpenicillin is less active against [[gram-negative]] bacteria than benzylpenicillin.<ref>{{cite journal

=== Susceptibility ===
While the number of penicillin-resistant bacteria is increasing, penicillin can still be used to treat a wide range of infections caused by certain susceptible bacteria, including Streptococci, Staphylococci, Clostridium, and Listeria genera. The following list illustrates [[minimum inhibitory concentration]] susceptibility data for a few medically significant bacteria:<ref name="Antimicrobial Index">{{cite web |url=http://antibiotics.toku-e.com/antimicrobial_914_18.html |title=Penicillin (Benzylpenicillin, Penicillin G, Bicillin C-R/L-A, Pfizerpen, Wycellin) |work=The Antimicrobial Index |publisher=Knowledgebase |accessdate=4 March 2014}}</ref><ref name="TOKU-E">{{cite web |url=http://www.toku-e.com/Assets/MIC/Penicillin%20G%20sodium%20salt.pdf |title=Penicillin G sodium salt Susceptibilty and Resistance Data |publisher=TOKU-E |accessdate=4 March 2014}}</ref>

* ''Neisseria meningitidis'': from less than or equal to 0.03 μg/ml to 0.5 μg/ml
* ''Staphylococcus aureus'': from less than or equal to 0.015 μg/ml to more than 32 μg/ml

== Side effects ==
{{Main|Side effects of penicillin}}
Common (≥ 1% of people) [[adverse drug reaction]]s associated with use of the penicillins include [[diarrhoea]], [[hypersensitivity]], [[nausea]], rash, [[neurotoxicity]], [[urticaria]], and [[superinfection]] (including [[candidiasis]]). Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of people) include fever, vomiting, [[erythema]], [[dermatitis]], [[angioedema]], [[seizures]] (especially in people with [[epilepsy]]), and [[pseudomembranous colitis]].<ref name="AMH2006" /> Penicillin can also induce [[serum sickness]] or a [[serum sickness-like reaction]] in some individuals. Serum sickness is a [[type III hypersensitivity]] reaction that occurs one to three weeks after exposure to drugs including penicillin. It is not a true drug allergy, because allergies are [[type I hypersensitivity]] reactions, but repeated exposure to the offending agent can result in an anaphylactic reaction.{{mcn|date=May 2017}} [[Anaphylaxis]] will occur in approximately 0.01% of patients.<ref name="AMH2006" />

Pain and inflammation at the injection site is also common for [[Parenteral#Parenteral by injection or infusion|parenterally]] administered benzathine benzylpenicillin, benzylpenicillin, and, to a lesser extent, procaine benzylpenicillin.{{mcn|date=May 2017}}

{{Main|Beta-lactam antibiotic}}
[[File:Penicillin spheroplast generation horizontal.svg|upright|Bacteria that attempt to grow and divide in the presence of penicillin fail to do so, and instead end up shedding their cell walls.|thumb|right|600px]]
[[File:Penicillin inhibition.svg|thumb|upright|right|Penicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics act by inhibiting [[penicillin-binding proteins]], which normally catalyze cross-linking of bacterial cell walls.]]

Bacteria constantly remodel their [[peptidoglycan]] cell walls, simultaneously building and breaking down portions of the cell wall as they grow and divide. [[beta-lactam antibiotic|''β''-Lactam antibiotics]] inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan [[cross-link]]s in the bacterial [[cell wall]]; this is achieved through binding of the four-membered ''β''-lactam [[cycloalkane|ring]] of penicillin to the [[enzyme]] [[DD-transpeptidase]]. As a consequence, DD-transpeptidase cannot [[Catalysis|catalyze]] formation of these cross-links, and an imbalance between cell wall production and degradation develops, causing the cell to rapidly die.

The enzymes that [[hydrolyze]] the peptidoglycan cross-links continue to function, even while those that form such cross-links do not. This weakens the cell wall of the bacterium, and osmotic pressure becomes increasingly uncompensated—eventually causing cell death ([[cytolysis]]). In addition, the build-up of peptidoglycan precursors triggers the activation of bacterial cell wall hydrolases and autolysins, which further digest the cell wall's peptidoglycans. The small size of the penicillins increases their potency, by allowing them to penetrate the entire depth of the cell wall. This is in contrast to the [[glycopeptide antibiotics]] [[vancomycin]] and [[teicoplanin]], which are both much larger than the penicillins.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Van Bambeke|first1=Francois|last2=Lambert|first2=Didier|last3=Mingeot-Leclercq|first3=Marie-Paule|last4=Tulkens|first4=Paul|title=Mechanism of Action|date=1999|url=http://www.facm.ucl.ac.be/Full-texts-FACM/Vanbambeke-1999-3.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

Gram-positive bacteria are called [[protoplast]]s when they lose their cell walls. [[Gram-negative]] bacteria do not lose their cell walls completely and are called [[spheroplast]]s after treatment with penicillin.

Penicillin shows a synergistic effect with [[aminoglycosides]], since the inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis allows aminoglycosides to penetrate the bacterial cell wall more easily, allowing their disruption of bacterial protein synthesis within the cell. This results in a lowered [[Minimum Bactericidal Concentration|MBC]] for susceptible organisms.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Winstanley|first1=TG|last2=Hastings|first2=JG|title=Penicillin-aminoglycoside synergy and post-antibiotic effect for enterococci.|journal=J Antimicrob Chemother|date=1989|volume=23|issue=2|pages=189–199|pmid=2708179|doi=10.1093/jac/23.2.189}}</ref>

Penicillins, like other ''β''-lactam antibiotics, block not only the division of bacteria, including [[cyanobacteria]], but also the division of cyanelles, the [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[organelle]]s of the [[glaucophyte]]s, and the division of [[chloroplast]]s of [[bryophyte]]s. In contrast, they have no effect on the [[plastid]]s of the highly developed [[vascular plant]]s. This supports the [[endosymbiotic theory]] of the [[evolution]] of plastid division in land plants.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Britta|last1=Kasten|first2=Ralf|last2=Reski|authorlink2=Ralf Reski|date=March 30, 1997|title=β-lactam antibiotics inhibit chloroplast division in a moss (Physcomitrella patens) but not in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum)|journal=Journal of Plant Physiology|volume=150|pages=137–140|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=2640663|issue=1–2|doi=10.1016/S0176-1617(97)80193-9}}</ref>

The chemical structure of penicillin is triggered with a very precise, pH-dependent directed mechanism, effected by a unique spatial assembly of molecular components, which can activate by protonation. It can travel through bodily fluids, targeting and inactivating enzymes responsible for cell-wall synthesis in gram-positive bacteria, meanwhile avoiding the surrounding non-targets. Penicillin can protect itself from spontaneous hydrolysis in the body in its anionic form, while storing its potential as a strong acylating agent, activated only upon approach to the target transpeptidase enzyme and protonated in the active centre. This targeted protonation neutralizes the carboxylic acid moiety, which is weakening of the β-lactam ring N–C(=O) bond, resulting in a self-activation. Specific structural requirements are equated to constructing the perfect mouse trap for catching targeted prey.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mucsi|first1=z|last2=Chass|first2=GA|last3=Ábrányi-Balogh|first3=P|last4=Jójárt|first4=B|last5=Fang|first5=DC|last6=Ramirez-Cuesta|first6=AJ|last7=Viskolcz|first7=B|last8=Csizmadia|first8=IG|title=Penicillin's catalytic mechanism revealed by inelastic neutrons and quantum chemical theory|journal=Phys Chem Chem Phys|year=2013|volume=15|issue=47|pages=20447–20455|pmid=23760063|doi=10.1039/c3cp50868d}}</ref>

== Structure ==
[[File:Penicillin-G 3D.png|thumb|right|Chemical structure of Penicillin G. The sulfur and nitrogen of the five-membered [[thiazolidine]] ring are shown in yellow and blue respectively. The image shows that the thiazolidine ring and fused four-membered ''β''-lactam are not in the same [[Plane (geometry)|plane]].]]

The term "[[penam]]" is used to describe the common core skeleton of a member of the penicillins. This core has the molecular formula R-C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>11</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>S, where R is the variable side chain that differentiates the penicillins from one another. The penam core has a [[molecular weight]] of 243&nbsp;g/mol, with larger penicillins having molecular weights near 450—for example, [[cloxacillin]] has a molecular weight of 436&nbsp;g/mol. The key structural feature of the penicillins is the four-membered ''β''-lactam ring; this structural [[moiety (chemistry)|moiety]] is essential for penicillin's antibacterial activity. The ''β''-lactam ring is itself fused to a five-membered [[thiazolidine]] ring. The fusion of these two rings causes the ''β''-lactam ring to be more reactive than monocyclic ''β''-lactams because the two fused rings distort the ''β''-lactam [[amide bond]] and therefore remove the [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance stabilisation]] normally found in these chemical bonds.<ref>Nicolaou (1996), pg. 43.</ref>

=== Discovery ===
{{Main|History of penicillin}}
[[File:Alexander Fleming.jpg|thumb|Alexander Fleming, who is credited with discovering penicillin in 1928.]]
[[File:Sample of penicillin mould presented by Alexander Fleming to Douglas Macleod, 1935 (9672239344).jpg|thumb|Sample of penicillium mould presented by Alexander Fleming to Douglas Macleod, 1935]]

Starting in the late 19th century there had been many accounts by scientists and physicians on the antibacterial properties of the different types of moulds including the mould [[penicillium]] but they were unable to discern what process was causing the effect.<ref>Thomas J. Dougherty, Michael J. Pucci, Antibiotic Discovery and Development, Springer Science & Business Media – 2011, pages 79–80</ref> The effects of penicillium mould would finally be isolated in 1928 by Scottish scientist [[Alexander Fleming]], in work that seems to have been independent of those earlier observations.<ref>Ralph Landau, Basil Achilladelis, Alexander Scriabine, Pharmaceutical Innovation: Revolutionizing Human Health, Chemical Heritage Foundation – 1999, page 162</ref> Fleming recounted that the date of his discovery of penicillin was on the morning of Friday 28 September 1928.<ref>{{cite book |author=Haven, Kendall F. |title=Marvels of Science : 50 Fascinating 5-Minute Reads |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |location=Littleton, CO |year=1994 |pages=182 |isbn=1-56308-159-8 }}</ref> The traditional version of this story describes the discovery as a [[Serendipity|serendipitous]] accident: in his laboratory in the basement of [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St&nbsp;Mary's Hospital]] in London (now part of [[Imperial College]]), Fleming noticed a Petri dish containing [[Staphylococcus]] that had been mistakenly left open was contaminated by blue-green mould from an open window, which formed a visible growth.<ref name=Lax2004>{{cite book |last= Lax |first= Eric |year= 2004 |title= The Mold in Dr. Florey's Coat: The Story of the Penicillin Miracle |publisher= Holt Paperbacks |isbn= 978-0-8050-7778-0 }}</ref> There was a halo of inhibited bacterial growth around the mould.

Once Fleming made his discovery he grew a pure [[cell culture|culture]] and discovered it was a ''Penicillium'' mould, now known as ''[[Penicillium chrysogenum]]''. Fleming coined the term "penicillin" to describe the [[filtrate]] of a broth culture of the ''Penicillium'' mould. Fleming asked C. J. La Touche to help identify the mould, which he incorrectly identified as ''[[Penicillium rubrum]]'' (later corrected by [[Charles Thom]]). He expressed initial optimism that penicillin would be a useful disinfectant, because of its high potency and minimal toxicity in comparison to antiseptics of the day, and noted its laboratory value in the isolation of ''Bacillus influenzae'' (now called ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'').<ref name=Lax2004 /><ref name=Fleming1929>{{cite journal | author=Fleming A. | title=On the antibacterial action of cultures of a penicillium, with special reference to their use in the isolation of ''B. influenzæ'' | journal=British Journal of Experimental Pathology | year=1929 | volume=10 | issue=31 | pages=226–236 | pmc=2048009 }} Reprinted in {{cite journal| author=Fleming A. | title=On the antibacterial action of cultures of a penicillium, with special reference to their use in the isolation of ''B. influenzæ'' |pmc=2566493 | pmid=11545337 | volume=79 | issue=8 | year=2001 | journal=Bull. World Health Organ. | pages=780–90}}</ref>

Fleming was a famously poor communicator and orator, which meant his findings were not initially given much attention.<ref name=Lax2004 /> He was unable to convince a chemist to help him extract and stabilize the antibacterial compound found in the broth filtrate. Despite this, he remained interested in the potential use of penicillin and presented a paper entitled "A Medium for the Isolation of Pfeiffer's Bacillus" to the [[Medical Research Club]] of London, which was met with little interest and even less enthusiasm by his peers. Had Fleming been more successful at making other scientists interested in his work, penicillin for medicinal use would possibly have been developed years earlier.<ref name=Lax2004 />

Despite the lack of interest of his fellow scientists, he did conduct several experiments on the antibiotic substance he discovered. The most important result proved it was nontoxic in humans by first performing toxicity tests in animals and then on humans. His following experiments on penicillin's response to heat and pH allowed Fleming to increase the stability of the compound.<ref name=Fleming1929 /> The one test that modern scientists would find missing from his work was the test of penicillin on an infected animal, the results of which would likely have sparked great interest in penicillin and sped its development by almost a decade.<ref name=Lax2004 />

=== Medical application ===
[[File:Howard Walter Florey 1945.jpg|thumb|Florey (pictured), Fleming and Chain shared a Nobel Prize in 1945 for their work on penicillin.]]
In 1930, Cecil George Paine, a [[pathologist]] at the [[Sheffield Royal Infirmary|Royal Infirmary]] in [[Sheffield]], attempted to use penicillin to treat [[sycosis barbae]], eruptions in beard follicles, but was unsuccessful.  Moving on to [[Neonatal conjunctivitis|ophthalmia neonatorum]], a gonococcal infection in infants, he achieved the first recorded cure with penicillin, on November 25, 1930. He then cured four additional patients (one adult and three infants) of eye infections, and failed to cure a fifth.<ref name="Wainwright, M & Swan, HT 1986 42–56">{{cite journal

Penicillin is actively excreted, and about 80% of a penicillin dose is cleared from the body within three to four hours of administration. Indeed, during the early penicillin era, the drug was so scarce and so highly valued that it became common to collect the urine from patients being treated, so that the penicillin in the urine could be isolated and reused.<ref name=Silverthorn2004>{{cite book | author=Silverthorn, DU. | title=Human physiology: an integrated approach. | edition=3rd | location=Upper Saddle River (NJ) | publisher=Pearson Education | year=2004 | isbn=0-8053-5957-5}}</ref> This was not a satisfactory solution, so researchers looked for a way to slow penicillin excretion. They hoped to find a molecule that could compete with penicillin for the organic acid transporter responsible for excretion, such that the transporter would preferentially excrete the competing molecule and the penicillin would be retained. The [[uricosuric]] agent [[probenecid]] proved to be suitable. When probenecid and penicillin are administered together, probenecid competitively inhibits the excretion of penicillin, increasing penicillin's concentration and prolonging its activity. Eventually, the advent of mass-production techniques and semi-synthetic penicillins resolved the supply issues, so this use of probenecid declined.<ref name=Silverthorn2004 /> Probenecid is still useful, however, for certain infections requiring particularly high concentrations of penicillins.<ref name=AMH2006>{{cite book | editor=Rossi S | title=[[Australian Medicines Handbook]] | year=2006 | location=Adelaide | publisher=Australian Medicines Handbook | isbn=0-9757919-2-3}}</ref>{{Update inline|date=May 2017}}

After World War II, Australia was the first country to make the drug available for civilian use.

=== Developments from penicillin ===
The narrow range of treatable diseases or "spectrum of activity" of the penicillins, along with the poor activity of the orally active phenoxymethylpenicillin, led to the search for derivatives of penicillin that could treat a wider range of infections. The isolation of 6-APA, the nucleus of penicillin, allowed for the preparation of semisynthetic penicillins, with various improvements over [[benzylpenicillin]] (bioavailability, spectrum, stability, tolerance).

The first major development was [[ampicillin]] in 1961. It offered a broader spectrum of activity than either of the original penicillins. Further development yielded β-lactamase-resistant penicillins, including [[flucloxacillin]], [[dicloxacillin]], and [[methicillin]]. These were significant for their activity against β-lactamase-producing bacterial species, but were ineffective against the [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) strains that subsequently emerged.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Another development of the line of true penicillins was the antipseudomonal penicillins, such as [[carbenicillin]], [[ticarcillin]], and [[piperacillin]], useful for their activity against [[Gram-negative]] bacteria. However, the usefulness of the β-lactam ring was such that related antibiotics, including the [[mecillinam]]s, the [[carbapenem]]s and, most important, the [[cephalosporin]]s, still retain it at the center of their structures.<ref>{{cite journal | last = James, PharmD | first = Christopher W. | author2 = Cheryle Gurk-Turner, RPh | title = Cross-reactivity of beta-lactam antibiotics | journal = Baylor University Medical Center Proceedings | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 106–7 | publisher = Baylor University Medical Center | location = Dallas, Texas |pmc=1291320 | pmid = 16369597 | date = January 2001}}</ref>

== Production ==
[[File:Penicillin bioreactor.jpg|thumb|A 1957 fermentor (bioreactor) used to grow ''Penicillium'' mould.]]
Penicillin is a [[Secondary metabolism|secondary metabolite]] of certain species of ''[[Penicillium]]'' and is produced when growth of the fungus is inhibited by stress. It is not produced during active growth. Production is also limited by feedback in the synthesis pathway of penicillin.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

::[[alpha-Ketoglutaric acid|α-ketoglutarate]] + [[Acetyl-CoA|AcCoA]] → [[Homocitric acid|homocitrate]] → [[alpha-Aminoadipic acid|<small>L</small>-α-aminoadipic acid]] → [[Lysine|<small>L</small>-lysine]] + [[Beta-lactam|β-lactam]]

The by-product, {{Smallcaps|l}}-lysine, inhibits the production of homocitrate, so the presence of exogenous lysine should be avoided in penicillin production.

The ''Penicillium'' cells are grown using a technique called [[fed-batch]] culture, in which the cells are constantly subject to stress, which is required for induction of penicillin production. The available carbon sources are also important: [[Glucose]] inhibits penicillin production, whereas [[lactose]] does not. The [[pH]] and the levels of nitrogen, lysine, phosphate, and oxygen of the batches must also be carefully controlled.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The [[Biotechnology|biotechnological]] method of [[directed evolution]] has been applied to produce by mutation a large number of ''Penicillium'' strains. These techniques include [[Polymerase chain reaction|error-prone PCR]], [[DNA shuffling]], {{abbr|ITCHY|incremental truncation for the creation of hybrid enzymes}}, and strand-overlap PCR.

Semisynthetic penicillins are prepared starting from the penicillin nucleus [[6-APA]].

=== Biosynthesis ===
[[File:Penicillin-biosynthesis.png|thumb|Penicillin G biosynthesis]]
Overall, there are three main and important steps to the biosynthesis of [[penicillin G]] (benzylpenicillin).
* The first step is the condensation of three amino acids—<small>L</small>-α-aminoadipic acid, <small>L</small>-cysteine, <small>L</small>-valine into a [[tripeptide]].<ref name ="Regulation">{{cite book

* The second step in the biosynthesis of penicillin G is the [[Redox|oxidative]] conversion of linear ACV into the [[Bicyclic molecule|bicyclic]] intermediate isopenicillin N by [[isopenicillin N synthase]] (IPNS), which is encoded by the gene ''pcbC''.<ref name ="Regulation" /><ref name=Molecular /> Isopenicillin N is a very weak intermediate, because it does not show strong antibiotic activity.<ref name=Fern />
* The final step is a [[transamidation]] by [[isopenicillin N N-acyltransferase]], in which the α-aminoadipyl side-chain of isopenicillin N is removed and exchanged for a [[Phenylacetic acid|phenylacetyl]] side-chain. This reaction is encoded by the gene ''penDE'', which is unique in the process of obtaining penicillins.<ref name ="Regulation" />
