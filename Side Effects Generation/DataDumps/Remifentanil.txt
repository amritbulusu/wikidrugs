'''Remifentanil'''  is a potent, short-acting synthetic [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] [[medication|drug]].  It is given to patients during surgery to relieve pain and as an adjunct to an [[anaesthetic]].  Remifentanil is used for [[sedation]] as well as combined with other medications for use in [[general anesthesia]]. The use of remifentanil has made possible the use of high-dose opioid and low-dose hypnotic anesthesia, due to synergism between remifentanil and various hypnotic drugs and volatile anesthetics.

== Clinical use ==
Remifentanil is used as an [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] that has a rapid onset and rapid recovery time.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title = Remifentanil, IV opioid analgesic, Remi  {{!}} Ultiva|url = http://www.ultiva.com/|website = www.ultiva.com|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}</ref> It has been used effectively during [[Craniotomy|craniotomies]],<ref>Gesztesi Z, Mootz BL, White PF.

==Administration==
It is administered in the form ''remifentanil hydrochloride'' and in adults is given as an [[intravenous infusion]] in doses ranging from 0.1 microgram per kilogram per minute to 0.5 (µg/kg)/min.  Children may require higher infusion rates (up to 1.0 (µg/kg)/min).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Weale NK, Rogers CA, Cooper R, Nolan J, Wolf AR |title=Effect of remifentanil infusion rate on stress response to the pre-bypass phase of paediatric cardiac surgery |journal=Br J Anaesth |volume=92 |issue=2 |pages=187–94 |date=February 2004 |pmid=14722167 |doi=10.1093/bja/aeh038}}</ref> The clinically useful infusion rates are 0.025-0.1 (µg/kg)/min for sedation (rates adjusted to age of patient, severity of their illness and invasiveness of surgical procedure). Small amounts of other sedative medications are usually co-administered with remifentanil to produce sedation.  Clinically useful infusion rates in [[general anesthesia]] vary but are usually 0.1-1&nbsp;µg/kg/min.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fass.se/LIF/product?userType=0&nplId=20090807000024|title=Remifentanil Actavis|language=Swedish|accessdate=21 Aug 2014}}</ref>

Remifentanil can be administered as part of an anesthesia technique called TIVA (Total Intravenous Anesthesia) using computer controlled infusion pumps in a process called target controlled infusion or TCI. A target plasma concentration is entered as ng/ml into the pump, which calculates its infusion rate according to patient factors like age and weight. Induction levels of 40&nbsp;ng/ml are commonly used, but it generally varies between 3-8&nbsp;ng/ml. For certain surgical procedures that produce particularly strong stimuli a level of up to 15&nbsp;ng/ml might be needed. The relatively short [[context-sensitive half-life]] of Remifentanil allows the desired [[blood plasma]] level to be achieved quickly and also for the same reason, recovery occurs quickly.

Remifentanil's short context-sensitive half-life makes it ideal for intense pain of short duration. As such, it has been used for analgesia in labor successfully; however, it is not as effective as epidural analgesia.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Anesthesia and Analgesia|title=A randomized controlled trial of the efficacy and respiratory effects of patient-controlled intravenous remifentanil analgesia and patient-controlled epidural analgesia in laboring women.|date= Mar 2014|pmid=24149580|doi=10.1213/ANE.0b013e3182a7cd1b|volume=118|issue=3|pages=589–97}}</ref>

In combination with [[propofol]], remifentanil is used for anesthesia of patients undergoing [[Electroconvulsive therapy]].<ref name=" pmid = 24398757 ">{{cite journal | author = Ulusoy H H | title = Sevoflurane/remifentanil versus propofol/remifentanil for electroconvulsive therapy: comparison of seizure duration and haemodynamic responses. | journal = J Int Med Res | volume = 42 | issue = 1|date=Feb 2014 | pmid = 24398757 | url = http://imr.sagepub.com/content/42/1/111.long | pages = 111–119 | doi=10.1177/0300060513509036}}</ref>

==Metabolism==
Unlike other synthetic opioids which are hepatically metabolized, remifentanil has an [[ester]] linkage which undergoes rapid hydrolysis by non-specific tissue and plasma [[esterase]]s.  This means that accumulation does not occur with remifentanil and its [[context-sensitive half-life]] remains at 4 minutes after a 4-hour infusion.

Remifentanil is metabolized to a compound (remifentanil acid) which has 1/4600th the potency of the parent compound.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hoke JF, Cunningham F, James MK, Muir KT, Hoffman WE |title=Comparative pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of remifentanil, its principle metabolite (GR90291) and alfentanil in dogs |journal=J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. |volume=281 |issue=1 |pages=226–32 |date=April 1997 |pmid=9103501}}</ref>

Due to its quick metabolism and short effects, remifentanil has opened up new possibilities in anesthesia. When remifentanil is used together with a hypnotic (i.e. one that produces sleep) it can be used in relative high doses.  This is because remifentanil will be rapidly eliminated from the blood plasma on termination of the remifentanil infusion, hence the effects of the drug will quickly dissipate even after very long infusions. Owing to synergism between remifentanil and hypnotic drugs (such as [[propofol]]) the dose of the hypnotic can be substantially reduced.<ref name = Patel>{{cite journal |doi= 10.2165/00003495-199652030-00009 |vauthors=Patel SS, Spencer CM |title=Remifentanil |journal= Drugs |volume= 52|date=Sep 1996 |issue=3 |pages=417–27 |pmid=8875131}}</ref> This leads often to more hemodynamic stability during surgery and a quicker post-operative recovery time.

==Side-effects==
Remifentanil is a specific [[Μ-opioid receptor|μ-receptor]] agonist.<ref name = Patel/>   Hence, it causes a reduction in [[sympathetic nervous system]] tone, [[respiratory depression]] and [[analgesia]]. The drug's effects include a dose-dependent decrease in [[heart rate]] and [[arterial pressure]] and [[respiratory rate]] and [[tidal volume]]. [[Muscle rigidity]] is sometimes noted.

The most common side effects reported by patients receiving this medication are a sense of extreme "dizziness" (often short lived, a common side effect of other fast-acting synthetic phenylpiperidine narcotics such as [[fentanyl]] and [[alfentanil]]) and intense itching ([[pruritus]]), often around the face.  These side effects are often controlled by either altering the administered dose  (decreasing or in some cases, increasing the dose) or by administering other [[sedative]]s that allow the patient to tolerate or lose awareness of the side effect.

Because pruritus is due to excessive serum histamine levels, antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) are often co-administered. This is done with care, however, as excessive sedation may occur.

Nausea can occur as a side effect of remifentanil, however, it is usually transient in nature due to the drug's short half-life which rapidly removes it from the patient's [[Circulatory system|circulation]] once the infusion is terminated.

==Potency==
Remifentanil is approximately twice as potent as fentanyl, and 100-200 times as potent as morphine.

==Circumventing naltrexone==
Remifentanil has been used with some success to circumvent [[naltrexone]] in patients who are in need of pain management.

== Abuse potential ==
Remifentanil, being a [[Μ-opioid receptor|μ-receptor]] [[agonist]], functions like other μ-receptor agonists, such as [[morphine]] and [[codeine]], and can cause euphoria and has the potential for abuse.<ref>Ternes, J. W., & O'Brien, C. P. (1990). The opioids: Abuse liability and treatments for dependence. ''Advances in alcohol & substance abuse'', ''9''(1-2), 27-45.</ref><ref>Panlilio, L. V., & Schindler, C. W. (2000). Self-administration of remifentanil, an ultra-short acting opioid, under continuous and progressive-ratio schedules of reinforcement in rats. ''Psychopharmacology'', ''150''(1), 61-66.</ref> However, due to its rapid metabolism and short-acting half-life the likelihood of becoming abused is quite low. Nevertheless, there have been some documentations of remifentanil abuse.<ref>Baylon, G. J., Kaplan, H. L., Somer, G., Busto, U. E., & Sellers, E. M. (2000).

== Development and Marketing ==
Prior to the development of remifentanil, most short-acting hypnotics and amnestics faced issues with prolonged use, where accumulation would result in unfavorable lingering effects during post-operative recovery. Remifentanil was designed to serve as a strong anesthetic with an ultra-short and predictable duration that would not have accumulation issues.<ref>Feldman, P. L. (2006).
