'''Octreotide''' (trade name '''Sandostatin''', among others) is an [[peptide|octapeptide]] that mimics natural [[somatostatin]] pharmacologically, though it is a more potent inhibitor of [[growth hormone]], [[glucagon]], and [[insulin]] than the natural hormone. It was first synthesized in 1979 by the chemist Wilfried Bauer.

==Medical uses==

===Tumors===
Octreotide is used for the treatment of [[growth hormone]] producing tumors ([[acromegaly]] and [[gigantism]]), when surgery is contraindicated, pituitary tumors that secrete [[thyroid stimulating hormone]] (thyrotropinoma), [[diarrhea]] and [[Flushing (physiology)|flushing]] episodes associated with [[carcinoid syndrome]], and diarrhea in people with [[vasoactive intestinal peptide]]-secreting tumors ([[VIPoma]]s).

===Bleeding esophageal varices===
Octreotide is often given as an infusion for management of acute [[haemorrhage]] from [[esophageal varices]] in liver [[cirrhosis]] on the basis that it reduces [[Portal hypertension|portal venous pressure]], though current evidence suggests that this effect is transient and does not improve survival.<ref name="pmid18677774">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gøtzsche PC, Hróbjartsson A | title = Somatostatin analogues for acute bleeding oesophageal varices | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = | issue = 3 | pages = CD000193 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18677774 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD000193.pub3 }}</ref>

===Radiolabelling===
{{Further|Octreotide scan}}
Octreotide is used in [[nuclear imaging|nuclear medicine imaging]] by labelling with [[indium-111]] (Octreoscan) to noninvasively image neuroendocrine and other tumours expressing somatostatin receptors.<ref>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/406655_3 Medscape: Octreoscan review]</ref>  More recently, it has been radiolabelled with [[carbon-11]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chin J, Vesnaver M, Bernard-Gauthier V, Saucke-Lacelle E, Wängler B, Wängler C, Schirrmacher R | year = 2013 | title = Amino Acids: Direct one-step labeling of cysteine residues on peptides with 11C-methyl triflate for the synthesis of PET radiopharmaceuticals | url = | journal = Amino Acids | volume =  45| issue = | pages =  1097–108| doi = 10.1007/s00726-013-1562-5 | pmid = 23921782 }}</ref> as well as [[gallium-68]], enabling imaging with [[positron emission tomography]] (PET), which provides higher resolution and sensitivity.

Octreotide can also be labelled with a variety of radionuclides, such as [[yttrium-90]] or [[lutetium-177]], to enable [[peptide receptor radionuclide therapy]] (PRRT) for the treatment of unresectable neuroendocrine tumours.

===Acromegaly===
Octreotide can also be used in the treatment of Acromegaly, a disorder of excessive growth hormone (GH). Octreotide, being a somatostatin analog, inhibits the release of GH from the pituitary gland through a process normally involved in negative feedback.

===Gastrointestinal fistulae===
Octreotide helps in management of the fistula by reducing GI secretions and inhibiting GI motility, thus controlling and reducing its output.{{fact|date=March 2016}} The value in healing intestinal fistulas is yet to be proven and routine use is limited because of the side effects.

==Contraindications==
Octreotide has not been adequately studied for the treatment of children and pregnant and lactating women. The drug is given to these groups of patients only if a [[risk-benefit analysis]] is positive.<ref name="AustriaCodex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2009|edition=2009/2010|isbn=3-85200-196-X|language=German}}</ref><ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile">{{cite book|title=Arzneistoff-Profile|editor=Dinnendahl, V |editor2=Fricke, U|publisher=Govi Pharmazeutischer Verlag|location=Eschborn, Germany|year=2010|edition=23|volume=8|isbn=978-3-7741-9846-3|language=German}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
The most frequent adverse effects (more than 10% of patients) are headache, [[hypothyroidism]], [[Electrical conduction system of the heart|cardiac conduction]] changes, [[gastrointestinal]] reactions (including cramps, nausea/vomiting and diarrhoea or constipation), [[gallstone]]s, reduction of [[insulin]] release, [[hyperglycemia]]<ref name="pmid20132129">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hovind P, Simonsen L, Bülow J | title = Decreased leg glucose uptake during exercise contributes to the hyperglycaemic effect of octreotide | journal = Clin Physiol Funct Imaging | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 141–5 |date=March 2010 | pmid = 20132129 | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-097X.2009.00917.x }}</ref> or [[hypoglycemia]], and (usually transient) injection site reactions. [[Slow heart rate]], skin reactions such as [[pruritus]], [[hyperbilirubinemia]], [[hypothyroidism]], [[dizziness]] and [[dyspnoea]] are also fairly common (more than 1%). Rare side effects include acute [[anaphylactic reaction]]s, [[pancreatitis]] and [[hepatitis]].<ref name="AustriaCodex" /><ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" /> One study reported a possible association with rheumatoid arthritis.<ref name="pmid21737909">{{cite journal | author = Saif MW | title = Rheumatoid arthritis associated with the use of Sandostatin® LAR® depot in a patient with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor.

==Overdose==
Octreotide is useful in overdose management of sulfonylurea type hypoglycemic medications, when recurrent or refractory to parenteral dextrose.  Mechanism of action is the suppression of insulin secretion.

== Interactions ==
Octreotide can reduce the intestinal resorption of [[ciclosporin]], possibly making it necessary to increase the dose.<ref name="Arzneimittel-Interaktionen">{{cite book|title=Arzneimittel-Interaktionen|editor=Klopp, T|publisher=Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Pharmazeutische Information|year=2010|edition=2010/2011|isbn=978-3-85200-207-1|language=German}}</ref> Patients with [[diabetes mellitus]] might need less [[insulin]] or [[oral antidiabetic]]s when treated with octreotide. The [[bioavailability]] of [[bromocriptine]] is increased;<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" />  besides being an [[antiparkinsonian]], bromocriptine is also used for the treatment of acromegaly.

==Pharmacology==
Since octreotide resembles somatostatin in physiological activities, it can:
* inhibit secretion of many hormones, such as [[gastrin]], [[cholecystokinin]], [[glucagon]], [[growth hormone]], [[insulin]], [[secretin]], [[pancreatic polypeptide]], [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]], and [[vasoactive intestinal peptide]],
* reduce secretion of fluids by the intestine and [[pancreas]],
* reduce gastrointestinal motility and inhibit contraction of the [[gallbladder]],
* inhibit the action of certain hormones from the [[anterior pituitary]],
* cause [[vasoconstriction]] in the blood vessels, and
* reduce portal vessel pressures in bleeding varices.

It has also been shown to produce [[analgesic]] effects, most probably acting as a [[partial agonist]] at the [[mu opioid receptor]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Maurer R, Gaehwiler BH, Buescher HH, Hill RC, Roemer D | date = Aug 1982 | title = Opiate antagonistic properties of an octapeptide somatostatin analog | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA | volume = 79 | issue = 15| pages = 4815–7 | pmid = 6126877 | pmc=346769 | doi=10.1073/pnas.79.15.4815}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen MP, Blake JF, Bryce DK, Haggan ME, Liras S, McLean S, Segelstein BE | year = 2000 | title = Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of 3-amino-3-phenylpropionamide derivatives as novel mu opioid receptor ligands | url = | journal = Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters | volume = 10 | issue = 6| pages = 523–6 | pmid = 10741545 | doi=10.1016/s0960-894x(00)00034-2}}</ref>

===Pharmacokinetics===
Octreotide is absorbed quickly and completely after [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous]] application. Maximal plasma concentration is reached after 30 minutes. The [[elimination half-life]] is 100 minutes (1.7 hours) on average when applied subcutaneously; after [[intravenous injection]], the substance is eliminated in two phases with half-lives of 10 and 90 minutes, respectively.<ref name="AustriaCodex" /><ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" />

==Research==
Octreotide has also been used [[off-label use|off-label]] for the treatment of severe, refractory diarrhea from other causes. It is used in toxicology for the treatment of prolonged recurrent hypoglycemia after [[sulfonylurea]] and possibly meglitinides overdose.  It has also been used with varying degrees of success in infants with [[nesidioblastosis]] to help decrease insulin hypersecretion. Several clinical trials also proves the effect of octreotide as acute treatment (abortive agent) in [[cluster headache]], where it shows that administration of subcutaneous octreotide is effective when compared with placebo.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 15455406 | doi=10.1002/ana.20210 | volume=56 | title=Subcutaneous octreotide in cluster headache: randomized placebo-controlled double-blind crossover study | journal=Ann Neurol | pages=488-94 | vauthors=Matharu MS, Levy MJ, Meeran K, Goadsby PJ}}</ref>
