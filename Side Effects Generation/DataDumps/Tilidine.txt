'''Tilidine''', or '''tilidate''' (brand names: '''Tilidin''', '''Valoron''' and '''Valtran''') is a synthetic [[opioid]] painkiller, used mainly in [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]], [[South Africa]] and [[Belgium]] for treatment of moderate to severe pain, both acute and chronic.<ref name = MD>{{cite web|title=Tilidine Hydrochloride|work=Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference|publisher=Pharmaceutical Press|date=13 December 2013|accessdate=18 April 2014|url=http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/martindale/current/6262-z.htm|editor=Brayfield, A}}</ref> Its onset of pain relief after oral administration is about 10–15 minutes and peak relief from pain occurs about 25–50 minutes after oral administration.<ref name = SPC/>

==Medical uses==
[[File:12-08-18-tilidin-retard.jpg|thumb|left|Tilidine]]
Tilidine is used in the form of [[hydrochloride]] or [[phosphate]] salt. In Germany, tilidine is available in a fixed combination with [[naloxone]] for oral administration (Valoron N and generics); the mixture of naloxone is claimed to lower the [[drug abuse|abuse]] liability of the opioid analgesic.<ref name = SPC/> This is so that if people take the medication orally (which is the way they are meant to) the opioid blocker, naloxone, has minimal effects on them but if they inject it the naloxone becomes bioavailable and hence antagonises the effects of the tilidine producing withdrawal effects.<ref name = SPC/><ref name="GG">{{cite book | isbn = 978-0-07-162442-8 | title = [[Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics]] | edition = 12th |author1=Brunton, L |author2=Chabner, B |author3=Knollman, B | year = 2010 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | location = New York }}</ref> In Switzerland the original Valoron brand with only tilidine and no naloxone is also available.<ref name = MD/>

As well as its use as an analgesic, tilidine is also commonly used in Germany for treatment of [[restless legs syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Tings, T |author2=Trenkwalder, C | title = When L-Dopa Preparations, Dopamine Agonists or Opioids?

P. Reynolds 'Cycloaliphatic Compoundss Thereof as analgesics' September 22, 1981</ref> is also known and is also a prodrug. 

Tilidine is a controlled substance in most countries, listed in the German BtMG, Austrian SMG, and in the USA under the Controlled Substances Act 1970 as ACSCN 9750 as a Narcotic under Schedule I, with an annual aggregate manufacturing quota of 10 grammes in 2014. It is used as the hydrochloride (free base conversion ratio 0.882) and HCl hemihydrate (0.858) <ref>http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/quotas/conv_factor/index.html</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Its most common adverse effects are transient nausea and vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, headache and nervousness; less commonly, nausea and vomiting (after repeated dosing), hallucinations, confusion, euphoria, tremor, hyperreflexia, clonus and increased sweating.<ref name = SPC/> Uncommonly, somnolence; rarely, diarrhoea and abdominal pain.<ref name = SPC/>

==Physicochemistry==
It usually comes in its [[hydrochloride]] [[hemihydrate]] salt form; in this form it is highly soluble in water, ethanol and [[dichloromethane]] and appears as a white/almost white crystalline powder.<ref name = MD/> Its storage is restricted by its insensitivity to light and sensitivity to degradation by oxygen, hence necessitating its storage in amber bottles and at temperatures below 30 degrees Celsius, respectively.<ref name = SPC/><ref name = MD/>

==Pharmacology==
Considered a low-to-medium-potency opioid, tilidine has the oral potency of about 0.2, that is, a dose of 100&nbsp;mg p.o. is equianalgesic to approximately 20&nbsp;mg [[morphine]] sulfate orally. It is administered orally (by mouth), rectally (by a [[suppository]]), or by [[injection (medicine)|injection]] (SC, IM or slowly IV) with single doses of 50 to 100&nbsp;mg, the maximal daily dose being up to 600&nbsp;mg.<ref>{{cite book | author = Waldvogel, HH | title = Analgetika, Antinozizeptiva, Adjuvanzien: Handbuch für die Schmerzpraxis | language = German | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-3-540-65796-5 }}</ref>

Tilidine itself is only a weak opioid, but is rapidly metabolised in the liver and gut to its active metabolite [[nortilidine]] and then to [[bisnortilidine]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book | author = Buschmann, H | title = Analgesics: From Chemistry and Pharmacology to Clinical Application | publisher = Wiley-VCH | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-3-527-30403-5 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Schulz, R |author2=Bläsig, J |author3=Wüster, M |author4=Herz, A | title = The Opiate-Like Action of Tilidine is Mediated by Metabolites | journal = Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology | year = 1978 | volume = 304 | issue = 2 | pages = 89–93 | pmid = 212687 | doi=10.1007/bf00495543}}</ref> It is the (1''S'',2''R'')-isomer (dextilidine)<ref>http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.27988.html?rid=61b9b5fa-0630-4dcb-8f35-ba86b3ba7000</ref> that is responsible for its analgesic activity.<ref>Drug Discovery and Commercial Exploitation Gerhard Satzinger Drug News Project pages 200–201 14(4) May 2001.</ref> The reversed ester of Tilidine is known<ref>US 4291059 'Cycloaliphatic Compounds Analgesic possessions Thereof' Derek P. Reynolds</ref> 

==Synthesis==
It is manufactured by a [[Diels-Alder reaction]] of 1-''N'',''N''-dimethylaminobuta-1,3-diene with ethyl atropate, yielding a mixture of [[isomer]]s,<ref>{{cite patent | inventor = Satzinger, G | title = Substituted Cyclohexenes, Derivatives thereof and Processes for Obtaining Same | country = US | status = patent | number = 3557127 | gdate = 1971-01-19 }}.</ref> of which only the (''E'')-(''trans'')-isomers are active and are separated subsequently from the mixture by [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of the inactive (''Z'')-(''cis'')-isomers as [[zinc]] [[complex (chemistry)|complex]].<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The inactive (''Z'')-(''cis'')-isomers may be epimerized to the more thermodynamically favored (''E'')-(''trans'')-isomers via reflux in diluted phosphoric acid.
