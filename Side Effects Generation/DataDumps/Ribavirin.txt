<!-- Definition and medical uses -->
'''Ribavirin''', also known as '''tribavirin''', is an [[antiviral medication]] used to treat [[Human respiratory syncytial virus|RSV infection]], [[hepatitis C]], and [[viral hemorrhagic fever]].<ref name=AHFS2016/> For hepatitis C it is used with other medications such as [[simeprevir]], [[sofosbuvir]], [[peginterferon alfa-2b]] or [[peginterferon alfa-2a]].<ref name=AHFS2016/> Among the viral hemorrhagic fevers it is used for [[Lassa fever]], [[Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever]], and [[Hantavirus infection]] but not [[Ebola]] or [[Marburg]].

==Mechanisms of action==
It is a [[guanosine]] (ribonucleic) [[Structural analog|analog]] used to stop viral RNA synthesis and viral mRNA capping, thus, it is a [[nucleoside]] inhibitor. Ribavirin is a [[prodrug]], which when metabolized resembles [[purine]] [[RNA]] [[nucleotide]]s. In this form, it interferes with RNA metabolism required for viral replication. Over five direct and indirect mechanisms have been proposed for its mechanism of action.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Graci JD, Cameron CE | title = Mechanisms of action of ribavirin against distinct viruses | journal = Reviews in medical virology | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 37-48 | date = January 2006  }}</ref>



===RNA viruses===
Ribavirin's carboxamide group can make the native nucleoside drug resemble [[adenosine]] or guanosine, depending on its rotation. For this reason, when ribavirin is incorporated into RNA, as a base analog of either adenine or guanine, it pairs equally well with either uracil or cytosine, inducing mutations in RNA-dependent replication in RNA viruses. Such hypermutation can be lethal to RNA viruses.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ortega-Prieto AM, Sheldon J, Grande-Pérez A, Tejero H, Gregori J, Quer J, Esteban JI, Domingo E, Perales C | title = Extinction of hepatitis C virus by ribavirin in hepatoma cells involves lethal mutagenesis | journal = PloS One | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = e71039 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23976977 | pmc = 3745404 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0071039 | editor1-last = Vartanian | editor1-first = Jean-Pierre }}</ref><ref name="pmid11907645">{{cite journal | vauthors = Crotty S, Cameron C, Andino R | title = Ribavirin's antiviral mechanism of action: lethal mutagenesis? | journal = Journal of Molecular Medicine | volume = 80 | issue = 2 | pages = 86–95 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 11907645 | doi = 10.1007/s00109-001-0308-0 }}</ref>

===DNA viruses===
Neither of these mechanisms explains ribavirin's effect on many DNA viruses, which is more of a mystery, especially given the complete inactivity of ribavirin's 2' deoxyribose analogue, which suggests that the drug functions only as an RNA nucleoside mimic, and never a DNA nucleoside mimic. Ribavirin 5'-monophosphate inhibits cellular [[IMP dehydrogenase|inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase]], thereby depleting intracellular pools of GTP.<ref name="pmid16421290">{{cite journal | vauthors = Leyssen P, De Clercq E, Neyts J | title = The anti-yellow fever virus activity of ribavirin is independent of error-prone replication | journal = Molecular Pharmacology | volume = 69 | issue = 4 | pages = 1461–7 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16421290 | doi = 10.1124/mol.105.020057 | url = http://molpharm.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16421290 }}</ref>

It was reported that ribavirin was active against a variety of RNA and DNA viruses in culture and in animals, without undue toxicity.<ref name="Sidwell1972">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sidwell RW, Huffman JH, Khare GP, Allen LB, Witkowski JT, Robins RK | title = Broad-spectrum antiviral activity of Virazole: 1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide | journal = Science | volume = 177 | issue = 4050 | pages = 705–6 | date = August 1972 | pmid = 4340949 | doi = 10.1126/science.177.4050.705 }}</ref>

===Names===
Ribavirin is the [[international nonproprietary name|INN]] and [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]], whereas tribavirin is the [[British Approved Name|BAN]]. Brand names of [[Generic drug|generic]] forms include Copegus, Ribasphere, Rebetol.<ref name=AHFS2016/>

==Derivatives==
Ribavirin is possibly best viewed as a ribosyl purine analogue with an incomplete purine 6-membered ring. This structural resemblance historically prompted replacement of the 2' nitrogen of the triazole with a carbon (which becomes the 5' carbon in an imidazole), in an attempt to partly "fill out" the second ring--- but to no great effect. Such 5' imidazole [[riboside]] derivatives show antiviral activity with 5' hydrogen or halide, but the larger the substituent, the smaller the activity, and all proved less active than ribavirin.<ref>{{cite book | author=Smith RA &amp; Kirkpatrick W (eds.) | year=1980 | chapter=Ribavirin: structure and antiviral activity relationships | title=Ribavirin: A Broad Spectrum Antiviral Agent | pages=1&ndash;21 | publisher=Academic Press | location=New York }}</ref> Note that two natural products were already known with this imidazole [[riboside]] structure: substitution at the 5' carbon with OH results in pyrazomycin/pyrazofurin, an antibiotic with antiviral properties but unacceptable toxicity, and replacement with an amino group results in the natural purine synthetic precursor 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside ([[Acadesine|AICAR]]), which has only modest antiviral properties.

===Taribavirin===
{{main article|Taribavirin}}
The most successful ribavirin derivative to date is the 3-carboxamidine derivative of the parent 3-carboxamide, first reported in 1973 by J.T.Witkowski et al.,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Witkowski JT, Robins RK, Khare GP, Sidwell RW | title = Synthesis and antiviral activity of 1,2,4-triazole-3-thiocarboxamide and 1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamidine ribonucleosides | journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 16 | issue = 8 | pages = 935–7 | date = August 1973 | pmid = 4355593 | doi = 10.1021/jm00266a014 }}</ref> and now called [[taribavirin]] (former names ''viramidine'' and ''ribamidine''). This drug shows a similar spectrum of antiviral activity to ribavirin, which is not surprising as it is now known to be a pro-drug for ribavirin. Viramidine, however, has useful properties of less erythrocyte-trapping and better liver-targeting than ribavirin. The first property is due to viramidine's basic amidine group which inhibits drug entry into RBCs, and the second property is probably due to increased concentration of the enzymes which convert amidine to amide, in liver tissue. Viramidine is in [[Clinical trial#Phase III|phase III]] human trials and may one day be used in place of ribavirin, at least against certain kinds of viral hepatitis. Viramidine's slightly superior toxicological properties may eventually cause it to replace ribavirin in all uses of ribavirin.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sidwell RW, Bailey KW, Wong MH, Barnard DL, Smee DF | title = In vitro and in vivo influenza virus-inhibitory effects of viramidine | journal = Antiviral Research | volume = 68 | issue = 1 | pages = 10–7 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16087250 | doi = 10.1016/j.antiviral.2005.06.003 }}</ref>
