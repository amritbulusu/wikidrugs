'''Oxidopamine''', also known as '''6-hydroxydopamine''' ('''6-OHDA''') or '''2,4,5-trihydroxyphenethylamine''', is a [[neurotoxin|neurotoxic]] synthetic [[organic compound]] used by researchers to selectively destroy [[dopaminergic]] and [[noradrenergic]] neurons in the brain. 6-OHDA is thought to enter the neurons via the [[dopamine]] and noradrenaline ([[norepinephrine]]) [[reuptake transporter]]s. Oxidopamine is often used in conjunction with a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (such as [[desipramine]]) to selectively destroy dopaminergic neurons.

The main use for oxidopamine in scientific research is to induce [[Parkinsonism]] in laboratory animals such as mice, rats and monkeys, in order to develop and test new medicines and treatments for [[Parkinson's disease]]. In order to induce this condition in animals, around 70% of the dopaminergic neurons in the [[substantia nigra]] of the brain must be destroyed, and this is achieved either with oxidopamine or [[MPTP]]. Both these agents likely destroy neurons by generating reactive oxygen species such as [[superoxide]] radical. Oxidopamine toxicity in neonatal rodents is also used as an animal model for the [[Lesch-Nyhan syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Breese GR, Knapp DJ, Criswell HE, Moy SS, Papadeas ST, Blake BL |title=The neonate-6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rat: a model for clinical neuroscience and neurobiological principles |journal=Brain Res.
