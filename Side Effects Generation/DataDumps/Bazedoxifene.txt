'''Bazedoxifene''', or '''bazedoxifene acetate''', is a third generation [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]] (SERM), [[drug development|developed]] by [[Pfizer]] following the completion of their takeover of [[Wyeth|Wyeth Pharmaceuticals]]. In late 2013, Pfizer received approval for bazedoxifene as part of the [[combination drug]] [[DUAVEE]] in the prevention (not treatment) of [[menopause|postmenopausal]] [[osteoporosis]].<ref>{{Cite journal

}}</ref> Bazedoxfiene is the result of an exclusive research collaboration between [[Wyeth|Wyeth Pharmaceuticals]] and [[Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Ligand Pharmaceuticals]]. 

It is also being studied for possible treatment of breast cancer and pancreatic cancer.<ref>http://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-06-osteoporosis-drug-growth-breast-cancer.html</ref>

The drug is a member of the [[2-phenylindole]] group of SERMs, along with [[zindoxifene]] and [[pipendoxifene]].<ref name="Gribble2010">{{cite book|author=Gordon W.

===Approval===
As of December 2011, the FDA have not given approval for the use of bazedoxifene in the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.SearchResults_Browse&DrugInitial=B|title=Drugs@FDA - Drug Names Beginning with "B"|date=7 July 2009|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=2009-07-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090711151804/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.SearchResults_Browse&DrugInitial=B| archivedate= 11 July 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The drug was approved in the European Union by the [[European Medicines Agency]] on April 27, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emea.europa.eu/humandocs/Humans/EPAR/conbriza/conbriza.htm|title=EPARs for authorised medicinal products for human use - Conbriza|date=26 May 2009|publisher=European Medicines Agency|language=|accessdate=2009-07-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090611221539/http://www.emea.europa.eu/humandocs/Humans/EPAR/conbriza/conbriza.htm| archivedate= 11 June 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

On October 3, 2013 the FDA approved the combination product of bazedoxifene 20 mg with 0.45 mg [[Premarin]] (conjugated estrogens) for the treatment of menopausal osteoporosis and the treatment of moderate to severe hot flushes.  This is the first approved hormone replacement therapy product that contains a SERM (bazedoxifene) and an estrogen.
