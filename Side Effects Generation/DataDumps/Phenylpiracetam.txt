[[Pilot-Cosmonaut of the Russian Federation|Pilot-cosmonaut]] [[Aleksandr Serebrov]] described being issued and using Phenylpiracetam, as well as it being included in the Soyuz spacecraft's standard emergency medical kit, during his [[Soyuz_TM-17|197-days working in space]] aboard the [[Mir]] space station.  He reported "the drug acts as the equalizer of the whole organism, 'combs' it(sic причесывает), completely excluding impulsiveness and irritability inevitable in the stressful conditions of space flight." <ref>https://medi.ru/info/427</ref>

Clinical trials were conducted at the Serbsky State Scientific Center for Social and Forensic Psychiatry. The [[Serbsky Center]], Moscow Institute of Psychiatry, and [[I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University|Russian Center of Vegetative Pathology]] are reported  to have confirmed the effectiveness of Phenylpiracetam(Phenytropil) describing the following effects: improvement of regional blood flow in ischemic regions of the brain, reduction of depressive and anxiety disorders, increase the resistance of brain tissue to hypoxia and toxic effects, improving concentration and mental activity, a psychoactivating(sic) effect, increase in the threshold of pain sensitivity, improvement in the quality of sleep, and an anticonvulsant action, though with the side effect of an anorexic effect in extended use.<ref>https://medi.ru/info/427</ref>

===Animal Model Research===
In [[Wistar rats]] with gravitational [[cerebral ischemia]], Phenylpiracetam reduced the extent of neuralgic deficiency manifestations, retained the locomotor, research, and memory functions, increased the survival rate, and lead to the favoring of local cerebral flow restoration upon the occlusion of [[carotid arteries]] to a greater extent than did [[piracetam]].<ref>{{ cite journal |vauthors=Tiurenkov IN, Bagmetov MN, Epishina VV | title = Comparative evaluation of the neuroprotective activity of phenotropil and piracetam in laboratory animals with experimental cerebral ischemia | journal = Eksp Klin Farmakol | year = 2007 | volume = 70 | issue = 2 | pages = 24–29 | pmid = 17523446 }}</ref>

====Operant behavior====
Phenylpiracetam is known to increase operant behavior.  In tests against a [[control group|control]], [[Sprague-Dawley]] rats given free access to less-preferred [[rat chow]] and trained to operate a lever repeatedly to obtain preferred rat chow performed additional work when given [[methylphenidate]], [[d-amphetamine]], and phenylpiracetam.  Rats given 1&nbsp;mg/kg amphetamine performed an average of 150% as much work and consumed 50% as much non-preferred rat chow than control rats; rats given 10&nbsp;mg/kg Methylphenidate performed 170% as much work and consumed similarly; and rats given 100&nbsp;mg/kg Phenylpiracetam performed an average of 375% as much work, and consumed little non-preferred rat chow.

{{quote|Present data show that (R)-phenylpiracetam increases motivation, i.e., the work load, which animals are willing to perform to obtain more rewarding food. At the same time consumption of freely available normal food does not increase. Generally this indicates that (R)-phenylpiracetam increase motivation [...] The effect of (R)-phenylpiracetam is much stronger than that of methylphenidate and amphetamine.<ref name="EP20140000021">{{cite patent

==Pharmacology==

Phenylpiracetam binds to [[α4β2]] nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the
mouse brain cortex with [[IC50]] = 5.86 μM.<ref name=firstova/>

In [[rats]], [[scopolamine]] is used to model memory impairment. It impairs performance in the conditioned passive avoidance reflex test, increases cortical [[Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor|nACh]] and hippocampal [[NMDA]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] densities, and decreases striatal [[Dopamine receptor D1|D<sub>1</sub>]] and cortical [[benzodiazepine]] receptor densities. Phenylpiracetam demonstrates antiamnestic activity by restoring performance in the passive avoidance test and partially reversing each of these scopolamine-induced receptor density changes.<ref name = firstova>{{ cite journal

Experiments performed on [[Sprague-Dawley]] rats in a European patent for using Phenylpiracetam to treat [[sleep disorders]] showed an increase in extracellular dopamine levels after administration.  The patent asserts discovery of phenypiracetam's action as a [[dopamine reuptake inhibitor]]<ref name="EP20140000021"/> as its basis.

{{quote|The peculiarity of this invention compared to former treatment approaches for treating sleep disorders is the so far unknown therapeutic efficacy of (R)-phenylpiracetam, which is presumably based at least in part on the newly identified activity of (R)-phenylpiracetam as the dopamine re-uptake inhibitor}}

Phenylpiracetam may also act as a [[noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor]], making it an [[Norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor|NDRI]].<ref name=firstova/>

==Availability==
[[File:Phenotropil.jpg|thumb|alt=Phenotropil|Phenotropil 100 mg from Russia]]
While not prescribed as a pharmaceutical in the [[Western world|West]], in [[Russia]] it is available as a prescription medicine under the name Phenotropil (but most drugstores sell it without prescriptions).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Phenylpiracetam is not scheduled by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA in the U.S]].<ref>[http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/orangebook/c_cs_alpha.pdf List of Controlled Substances]</ref>

Phenylpiracetam is readily-synthesized commercially. To avoid the problem of attaching the phenyl group to [[piracetam]] at position 5 rather than 3 or 4, commercial syntheses cyclizes [[phenibut]] by replacing the [[hydroxide]] with a [[hydrogen]] to create a [[pyrrole]] group and then reacting [[bromoacetic acid]] and [[ammonia]] to replace the [[bromine]] with the [[nitrogen]] on the pyrrole.  This produces a racemic phenylpiracetam, which then undergoes purification to produce the final product.

==Athlete doping==
Because it increases physical [[Endurance|stamina]] and provides improved tolerance to cold weather, it appears on the lists of stimulants banned for in-competition use by the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]]. This list is applicable in all [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] sports.<ref>https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/2016-09-29_-_wada_prohibited_list_2017_eng_final.pdf Page-6</ref>
