Aldosterone is part of the [[renin–angiotensin system]]. It has a [[plasma half-life]] of under 20&nbsp;minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK13300/|title=Pharmacokinetics of Corticosteroids|accessdate=15 June 2016|year=2003}}</ref> Drugs that interfere with the secretion or action of aldosterone are in use as antihypertensives, like [[lisinopril]], which lowers blood pressure by blocking the [[angiotensin-converting enzyme]] (ACE), leading to lower aldosterone secretion. The net effect of these drugs is to reduce sodium and water retention but increase retention of potassium. In other words, these drugs stimulate the excretion of sodium and water in urine, while they block the excretion of potassium. 

Another example is [[spironolactone]], a [[potassium-sparing diuretic]] of the [[steroid]]al [[spirolactone]] group, which decreases blood pressure by releasing fluid from the body while retaining potassium.

Aldosterone was first isolated by [[Sylvia Agnes Sophia Tait|Simpson]] and [[James Francis Tait|Tait]] in 1953.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Williams JS, Williams GH |title=50th anniversary of aldosterone |journal=J Clin Endocrinol Metab. |volume=88 |issue=6 |pages=2364–72 |date=June 2003 |pmid=12788829 |doi= 10.1210/jc.2003-030490|url=http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12788829}}</ref>

==Biosynthesis==
The [[corticosteroids]] are synthesized from [[cholesterol]] within the [[zona glomerulosa]] of [[adrenal cortex]]. Most [[steroidogenic]] reactions are catalysed by enzymes of the [[cytochrome]] P450 family. They are located within the [[mitochondria]] and require [[adrenodoxin]] as a cofactor (except [[21-hydroxylase]] and [[17α-hydroxylase]]).

Aldosterone and [[corticosterone]] share the first part of their biosynthetic pathways. The last parts are mediated either by the [[aldosterone synthase]] (for aldosterone) or by the [[11β-hydroxylase]] (for [[corticosterone]]). These enzymes are nearly identical (they share 11β-hydroxylation and [[18-hydroxylation]] functions), but aldosterone synthase is also able to perform an 18-[[oxidation]]. Moreover, aldosterone synthase is found within the zona glomerulosa at the outer edge of the [[adrenal cortex]]; 11β-hydroxylase is found in the [[zona glomerulosa]] and  [[zona fasciculata]].

[[File:Steroidogenesis.svg|thumb|450px|[[Steroidogenesis]], showing aldosterone synthesis at upper-right corner.<ref name="HäggströmRichfield2014">{{cite journal|last2=Richfield|first2=David|year=2014|title=Diagram of the pathways of human steroidogenesis|journal=WikiJournal of Medicine|volume=1|issue=1|doi=10.15347/wjm/2014.005|issn=2002-4436|last1=Häggström|first1=Mikael}}</ref>]]

Note: [[aldosterone synthase]] is absent in other sections of the [[adrenal gland]].

===Stimulation===
Aldosterone synthesis is stimulated by several factors:

* increase in the plasma concentration of angiotensin III, a metabolite of angiotensin II
* increase in [[blood plasma|plasma]] [[angiotensin II]], [[ACTH]], or [[potassium]] levels, which are present in proportion to plasma sodium deficiencies. (The increased potassium level works to regulate aldosterone synthesis by depolarizing the cells in the [[zona glomerulosa]], which opens the [[voltage-dependent calcium channel]]s.) The level of angiotensin II is regulated by [[angiotensin I]], which is in turn regulated by [[renin]], a hormone secreted in the kidneys.
* Serum potassium concentrations are the most potent stimulator of aldosterone secretion.
* the [[ACTH stimulation test]], which is sometimes used to stimulate the production of aldosterone along with [[cortisol]] to determine whether primary or secondary [[adrenal insufficiency]] is present. However, ACTH has only a minor role in regulating aldosterone production; with hypopituitarism there is no atrophy of the zona glomerulosa.
* plasma [[acidosis]]
* the [[Mechanoreceptors|stretch receptors]] located in the [[Atrium (heart)|atria]] of the heart. If decreased blood pressure is detected, the adrenal gland is stimulated by these stretch receptors to release aldosterone, which increases sodium reabsorption from the urine, sweat, and the gut. This causes increased osmolarity in the extracellular fluid, which will eventually return blood pressure toward normal.
* adrenoglomerulotropin, a [[lipid factor]], obtained from pineal extracts. It selectively stimulates secretion of aldosterone.<ref>{{cite journal |author =Farrell G |title=Adrenoglomerulotropin |journal=Circulation |volume=21 |issue= 5|pages=1009–15 |date=May 1960 |pmid=13821632 |doi= 10.1161/01.CIR.21.5.1009}}</ref>

The secretion of aldosterone has a [[Day|diurnal]] rhythm.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hurwitz S, Cohen RJ, Williams GH |title=Diurnal variation of aldosterone and plasma renin activity: timing relation to melatonin and cortisol and consistency after prolonged bed rest |journal=J App Physiol |volume=96 |issue=4 |pages=1406–14 |date=April 2004 |pmid=14660513 |doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.00611.2003 |url=http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/96/4/1406}}</ref>

==Biological function==
Aldosterone is the primary of several endogenous members of the class of [[mineralocorticoid]]s in humans. [[Deoxycorticosterone]] is another important member of this class. Aldosterone tends to promote Na<sup>+</sup> and water retention, and lower plasma K<sup>+</sup> concentration by the following mechanisms:

# Acting on the nuclear [[mineralocorticoid receptor]]s (MR) within the principal cells of the [[distal tubule]] and the [[collecting duct]] of the kidney nephron, it upregulates and activates the [[basolateral]] [[Na+/K+-ATPase|Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pumps]], which pumps three sodium ions out of the cell, into the interstitial fluid and two potassium ions into the cell from the interstitial fluid. This creates a concentration gradient which results in reabsorption of sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) ions and water (which follows sodium) into the blood, and secreting potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) ions into the urine (lumen of collecting duct).
# Aldosterone upregulates epithelial sodium channels ([[ENaC]]s) in the [[Collecting duct system|collecting duct]] and the colon, increasing apical membrane permeability for Na<sup>+</sup> and thus absorption.
# Cl<sup>−</sup> is reabsorbed in conjunction with sodium cations to maintain the system's electrochemical balance.
# Aldosterone stimulates the secretion of K<sup>+</sup> into the tubular lumen.<ref name="pmid10760062">{{cite journal|year=2000|last1=Palmer|first1=LG|last2=Frindt|first2=G|title=Aldosterone and potassium secretion by the cortical collecting duct|journal=Kidney International|volume=57|issue=4|pages=1324–8|pmid=10760062|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1755.2000.00970.x}}</ref> 
# Aldosterone stimulates Na<sup>+</sup> and water reabsorption from the gut, salivary and sweat glands in exchange for K<sup>+</sup>.
# Aldosterone stimulates secretion of H<sup>+</sup> via the H+/ATPase in the [[intercalated cells]] of the cortical collecting tubules
# Aldosterone upregulates expression of [[Sodium-chloride symporter|NCC]] in the distal convoluted tubule chronically and its activity acutely.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Aldosterone acutely stimulates NCC activity via a SPAK-mediated pathway|journal = American Journal of Physiology.

Aldosterone is responsible for the reabsorption of about 2% of filtered sodium in the kidneys, which is nearly equal to the entire sodium content in human blood under normal [[glomerular filtration rate]]s.<ref>{{cite book |author =Sherwood, Lauralee |title=Human physiology: from cells to systems |publisher=Brooks/Cole |location=Pacific Grove, CA |year=2001 |pages= |isbn=0-534-56826-2 |oclc= 43702042|doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Aldosterone, probably acting through mineralocorticoid receptors, may positively influence neurogenesis in the [[dentate gyrus]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fischer AK, von Rosenstiel P, Fuchs E, Goula D, Almeida OF, Czéh B |title=The prototypic mineralocorticoid receptor agonist aldosterone influences neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the adrenalectomized rat |journal=Brain Res. |volume=947 |issue=2 |pages=290–3 |date=August 2002 |pmid=12176172 |doi= 10.1016/S0006-8993(02)03042-1|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006899302030421}}</ref>

==Mineralocorticoid receptors==
[[Steroid receptor]]s are [[intracellular]]. The aldosterone [[mineralocorticoid receptor]] (MR) complex binds on the DNA to specific [[hormone response element]], which leads to gene specific [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]].

Some of the transcribed genes are crucial for transepithelial sodium transport, including the three [[Protein subunit|subunits]] of the [[epithelial sodium channel]] (ENaC), the [[Na+/K+-ATPase|Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pumps]] and their regulatory proteins [[serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase]], and [[channel-inducing factor]], respectively.

The MR is stimulated by both aldosterone and cortisol, but a mechanism protects the body from excess aldosterone receptor stimulation by glucocorticoids (such as cortisol), which happen to be present at much higher concentrations than mineralocorticoids in the healthy individual. The mechanism consists of an enzyme called [[11-Beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase|11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]] (11β-HSD). This enzyme co-localizes with intracellular adrenal steroid receptors and converts cortisol into cortisone, a relatively inactive metabolite with little affinity for the MR. [[Liquorice]], which contains [[glycyrrhetinic acid]], can inhibit 11β-HSD and lead to a mineralocorticoid excess syndrome.

====The role of baroreceptors====
Pressure-sensitive [[baroreceptor]]s are found in the vessel walls of nearly all large arteries in the thorax and neck, but are particularly plentiful in the sinuses of the carotid arteries and in the arch of the aorta. These specialized receptors are sensitive to changes in mean arterial pressure. An increase in sensed pressure results in an increased rate of firing by the baroreceptors and a negative feedback response, lowering systemic arterial pressure. Aldosterone release causes sodium and water retention, which causes increased blood volume, and a subsequent increase in blood pressure, which is sensed by the baroreceptors.<ref>Copstead, E. C. & Banasik, J. L. (2010.) Pathophysiology. (4th ed.). St. Louis, Mo: Saunders Elsevier.</ref>  To maintain normal homeostasis these receptors also detect low blood pressure or low blood volume, causing aldosterone to be released. This results in sodium retention in the kidney, leading to water retention and increased blood volume.<ref>Marieb, E. N. (2004) Human anatomy and physiology (6th ed) San Francisco: Pearson Benjamin Cummings.</ref>

Thus, the potassium is strongly regulated at all sodium intakes by aldosterone when the supply of potassium is adequate, which it usually is in primitive diets.

===Aldosterone feedback===
Feedback by aldosterone concentration itself is of a nonmorphological character (that is, other than changes in the cells' number or structure) and is poor, so the electrolyte feedbacks predominate, short term.<ref name=Glaz/>

==Associated clinical conditions==
[[Hyperaldosteronism]] is abnormally increased levels of aldosterone, while [[hypoaldosteronism]] is abnormally decreased levels of aldosterone.

A measurement of aldosterone in blood may be termed a ''plasma aldosterone concentration'' (''PAC''), which may be compared to [[plasma renin activity]] (PRA) as an [[aldosterone-to-renin ratio]].

===Hyperaldosteronism===
[[Primary aldosteronism]], also known as ''primary hyperaldosteronism'', is characterized by the overproduction of aldosterone by the [[adrenal gland]]s,<ref name=conn>{{cite journal |vauthors=Conn JW, Louis LH |title=Primary aldosteronism:  a new clinical entity |journal=Trans. Assoc. Am. Physicians |volume=68 |issue= |pages=215–31; discussion, 231–3 |year=1955 |pmid=13299331 |doi= |url=}}</ref> when not a result of excessive renin secretion. It leads to [[arterial hypertension]] (high blood pressure) associated with hypokalemia, usually a diagnostic clue. [[Secondary hyperaldosteronism]], on the other hand, is due to overactivity of the [[renin-angiotensin system]].

[[Conn's syndrome]] is primary hyperaldosteronism caused by an aldosterone-producing adenoma.

Depending on cause and other factors, hyperaldosteronism can be treated by surgery and/or medically, such as by [[aldosterone antagonist]]s.

===Hypoaldosteronism===
An [[ACTH stimulation test#Aldosterone stimulation|ACTH stimulation test for aldosterone]] can help in determining the cause of [[hypoaldosteronism]], with a low aldosterone response indicating a primary hypoaldosteronism of the adrenals, while a large response indicating a secondary hypoaldosteronism.
