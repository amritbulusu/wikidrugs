It was marketed by the [[pharmaceutical company]] [[Bayer|Bayer A.G.]] in the late 1990s, competing with [[Pfizer Inc.|Pfizer]]'s highly successful [[atorvastatin]] (Lipitor). Cerivastatin was voluntarily withdrawn from the market worldwide in 2001, due to reports of fatal [[rhabdomyolysis]].

During [[postmarketing surveillance]], 52 deaths were reported in patients using cerivastatin, mainly from rhabdomyolysis and its resultant [[renal failure]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Furberg CD, Pitt B|title=Withdrawal of cerivastatin from the world market|journal=Curr Control Trials Cardiovasc Med|year=2001|volume=2|page=205&ndash;207|pmid=11806796|doi=10.1186/cvm-2-5-205|pmc=59524}}</ref> Risks were higher in patients using [[fibrate]]s, mainly [[gemfibrozil]] (Lopid), and in patients using the highest (0.8&nbsp;mg/day) dose of cerivastatin.

This put the risk of this (rare) complication at 5-10 times that of the other [[statin]]s.
