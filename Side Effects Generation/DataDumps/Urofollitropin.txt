Given by [[subcutaneous injection]], it is used in combination with [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG) to assist in [[ovulation]] and [[fertility]].<ref name="Drugs.com">Drugs.com: [http://www.drugs.com/cons/urofollitropin-intramuscular-subcutaneous-injection.html Urofollitropin (Intramuscular route, Subcutaneous route, Injection route)]</ref> It is also used with [[in vitro fertilization|''in vitro'' fertilization]] methods. The dosage is adjusted to each individual's response.<ref name="Drugs.com" />

The most common side effects are abdominal or pelvic pain, bloating, as well as redness, pain or swelling at the injection site. Follitropin is possibly associated with increased risk of endometrial carcinoma. It is not for use during pregnancy, as there is evidence for birth defects under follitropin treatment.<ref name="Drugs.com" />
