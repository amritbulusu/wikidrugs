'''Diosmin''' is a [[flavone]], a member of the flavonoid family. Diosmin [[aglycone]] is [[diosmetin]]. It can be found in ''[[Teucrium gnaphalodes]]'', a plant endemic to the Iberian Peninsula.<ref>Flavonoid Aglycones and Glycosides from Teucrium gnaphalodes. F. A. T. Barberán, M. I. Gil, F. Tomás, F. Ferreres and A. Arques, J. Nat. Prod., 1985, 48 (5), pages 859–860, {{doi|10.1021/np50041a040}}</ref>

== Drug  ==
Diosmin is a [[semisynthetic]] [[flavonoid]] molecule derived from citrus d (modified [[hesperidin]]). It is an oral phlebotropic drug used in the treatment of venous disease, i.e., [[chronic venous insufficiency]] (CVI) including spider and varicose veins, leg swelling ([[edema]]), [[stasis dermatitis]] and [[venous ulcer]]s. It is also used as a stand-alone or surgical adjunctive therapy in [[hemorrhoid]]al disease (HD).

There are extensive clinical trials that show diosmin improves all stages of venous disease including venous ulcers and improves quality of life.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jantet|first=G.|date=2002-06-01|title=Chronic venous insufficiency: worldwide results of the RELIEF study.

Diosmin is currently a prescription medication in some European countries (under the Dio-PP, Venotec, Daflon etc. tradenames), and is sold as a nutritional supplement in the United States.

Diosmin has been found to be effective in mitigating hyperglycemia in diabetic rats.<ref>Leelavinothan Pari, Subramani Srinivasan, Antihyperglycemic effect of diosmin on hepatic key enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism in streptozotocin-nicotinamide-induced diabetic rats, Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy, Volume 64, Issue 7, September 2010, Pages 477-481.</ref> It is also speculated that diosmin might have potential in the treatment of [[Neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative disease]]<nowiki/>s,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sirlak|first=Mustafa|last2=Akar|first2=A.

=== Mechanisms ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2008}}
Diosmin prolongs the [[vasoconstrictor]] effect of [[norepinephrine]] on the vein wall, increasing venous tone, and therefore reducing venous capacitance, distensibility, and [[stasis (medicine)|stasis]]. This increases the venous return and reduces venous hyperpressure present in patients suffering from CVI.

Diosmin improves lymphatic drainage by increasing the frequency and intensity of lymphatic contractions, and by increasing the total number of functional lymphatic capillaries. Furthermore, diosmin with hesperidine decreases the diameter of lymphatic capillaries and the intralymphatic pressure.

At the microcirculation level, diosmin reduces capillary hyperpermeability and increases capillary resistance by protecting the microcirculation from damaging processes.

Diosmin reduces the expression of [[endothelial adhesion molecules]] ([[ICAM1]], [[VCAM1]]), and inhibits the adhesion, migration, and activation of leukocytes at the capillary level. This leads to a reduction in the release of inflammatory mediators, principally oxygen free radicals and [[prostaglandins]] ([[PGE2]], PGF2a).

=== Regulatory status ===
Diosmin is distributed in the U.S. as a dietary supplement and as a prescription [[medical food]].<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/95s0316/95s-0316-rpt0293-01-vol228.pdf Public Health Service memorandum], Sept. 13, 2005</ref>  The [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] concluded  that there was inadequate evidence on which to base an expectation of safety.,<ref>New Dietary Ingredients in Dietary Supplements, U. S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements
February 2001 (Updated September 10, 2001)

[http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/95s0316/rpt0083_01.pdf]</ref>
however, diosmin products have beed used in Europe for over 40 years with no safety issues. One company that markets diosmin supplements, Nutratech, has responded that diosmin can reasonably be expected to be safe on the basis of clinical trials, and has a long history of use in Europe.  In the U.S., dietary supplements are regulated under [[Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994]], which does not require proof of efficacy so long as no specific health claims are made. The enhanced version of diosmin, is sold as a medical food product Under [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] regulation, [[medical food]] products must obtain [[GRAS]] (generally recognized as safe) status and have scientifically proven efficacy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/ucm054048.htm|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>
