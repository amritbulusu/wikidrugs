A '''British Approved Name''' ('''BAN''') is the official non-proprietary or generic name given to a [[pharmaceutical]] [[Chemical substance|substance]], as defined in the [[British Pharmacopoeia|British Pharmacopoeia (BP)]].<br> The BAN is also the official name used in some countries across the world, because starting in 1953, proposed new names were evaluated by a panel of experts from [[World Health Organization|WHO]] in conjunction with the BP commission  to ensure naming consistency worldwide<ref name="Cartwright2015">{{cite book|author=Mr Anthony C Cartwright|title=The British Pharmacopoeia, 1864 to 2014: Medicines, International Standards and the State|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fw6yCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA155|date=28 June 2015|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4724-2032-9|pages=155–}}</ref> (an effort leading to the [[International Nonproprietary Name]] system).

==Combination preparations==
BANs are unique in that names are assigned for combination preparations as well as single-drug preparations. For example, the BAN [[Co-amoxiclav]] is assigned to preparations containing [[amoxicillin]] and [[clavulanic acid]]. Most other pharmacopoeias simply refer to combination products by both ingredients in the preparation, in this example "amoxicillin with clavulanic acid".

The prefix of "co-" is used for many combination drugs, including opioid with paracetamol or aspirin [[analgesics]] (e.g., [[Co-codamol]], [[Co-codaprin]], [[Co-dydramol]], [[Co-proxamol]]). The other commonly encountered opioid combination is the [[anti-diarrhoeal]], non-analgesic mixture of [[diphenoxylate]] and [[atropine]], [[Co-phenotrope]] (a.k.a. [[Lomotil]]). Also [[antibiotics]] (e.g., [[Co-fluampicil]] and [[Co-trimoxazole]]), drugs to lower blood pressure (e.g., [[Co-tenidone]]), [[diuretics]] (e.g., [[Co-amilofruse]] and [[Co-amilozide]]), [[gastrointestinal]] drugs (e.g., [[Co-danthrusate]]), and anti-[[Parkinsonism]] agents such as [[Co-careldopa]], [[Co-beneldopa]], and others (e.g., [[Co-cyprindiol]]).

==BAN harmonisation==
[[European Union]] legislation from 2001 required harmonisation of the BP with the [[European Pharmacopoeia|European Pharmacopoeia (EP)]], as well as the adoption of [[International Nonproprietary Name]]s through directives (2001/82/EC <ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/health/files/eudralex/vol-5/dir_2001_82/dir_2001_82_en.pdf "2001/82/EC"]</ref> and 2001/83/EC,<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:2001L0083:20070126:en:PDF "2001/83/EC"]</ref> as amended, and 2003/63/EC <ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:159:0046:0094:en:PDF "2003/63/EC"]</ref>). Across the EU has meant that, with the notable exception of [[epinephrine|adrenaline/epinephrine]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Aronson|first1=JK|title="Where name and image meet"--the argument for "adrenaline".|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=19 February 2000|volume=320|issue=7233|pages=506–9|pmid=10678871|doi=10.1136/bmj.320.7233.506|pmc=1127537}}</ref> BANs are now the same as the INNs. For example, the old BAN ''methicillin'' was replaced with the current BAN ''[[meticillin]]'', matching the INN.

This has resulted in an interesting situation in other countries that use BANs. While the British Pharmacopoeia and BANs are the official pharmacopoeia/names defined by legislation in many of these countries, the former BANs often continue to be used, purportedly because of the difficulty of changeover.  Despite the importance of the BP, there appears to be little or no movement in the direction of changing these names. In Australia, the [[Australian Approved Name]]s are generally the same as BANs, but a few exceptions remain.
