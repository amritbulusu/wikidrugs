'''Edrecolomab''' (MAb17-1A, trade name '''Panorex''') is a mouse-derived [[monoclonal antibody]] targeting the cell-surface [[glycoprotein]] [[EpCAM]] (17-1A), which is expressed on [[epithelium|epithelial tissues]] and on various [[carcinoma]]s.

Preliminary studies had shown promise of a possible use in patients with stage III [[colorectal carcinoma]] (with [[metastasis]] to the [[lymph nodes]]).<ref name="Lancet1994">Riethmüller G, Schneider-Gädicke E, Schlimok G ''et al.''

Edrecolomab was well tolerated in these studies and as such research has now concentrated on whether it can be of any use in other forms of cancer.
