'''Methoxsalen''' — also called '''xanthotoxin''', marketed under the trade names '''''Oxsoralen''''', '''''Deltasoralen''''', '''''Meladinine''''' — is a [[medication|drug]] used to treat [[psoriasis]], [[eczema]], [[vitiligo]], and some [[lymphoma|cutaneous lymphomas]] in conjunction with exposing the skin to UVA light from lamps or sunlight. Methoxsalen modifies the way skin cells receive the [[Ultraviolet|UVA]] radiation, allegedly clearing up the disease. The dosage comes in 10&nbsp;mg tablets, which are taken in the amount of 30&nbsp;mg 75&nbsp;minutes before a [[PUVA]] ([[psoralen]] + [[Ultraviolet|UVA]]) light treatment. Levels of individual patient PUVA exposure were originally determined using the [[Fitzpatrick scale]]. The scale was developed after patients demonstrated symptoms of [[phototoxicity]] after oral ingestion of Methoxsalen followed by PUVA therapy.
Chemically, methoxsalen belongs to a class of organic natural molecules known as [[furanocoumarin]]s. They consist of [[coumarin]] [[annulate]]d with [[furan]]. It can also be injected and used topically.

== Natural occurrences ==
Methoxsalen is extracted from ''[[Ammi majus]]'', a plant of the family [[Apiaceae]]. The substance is also present in other Apiaceae as well as [[Rutaceae]], for example [[monarda|bergamot]] oil which is used in many perfumes and aromatherapy oils. When these products are applied to skin and exposed to UVA radiation, the skin may turn brownish due to the phototoxic effects of methoxsalen present in the bergamot oil.<ref>{{cite web | title=Bergamot | url=http://www.oilsandplants.com/bergamot.htm | publisher=oilsandplants.com | accessdate=2010-12-29}}</ref> Most modern perfumes containing bergamot have the Methoxsalen removed.

== Biosynthesis ==
The biosynthetic pathway is a combination of the [[shikimate]] pathway, which produces [[umbelliferone]], and the [[mevalonate pathway]].

=== Synthesis of umbelliferone ===
[[File:Umbelliferone.svg|thumb|[[Umbelliferone]]]]
Umbelliferone is a [[phenylpropanoid]] and as such is synthesized from [[L-phenylalanine]], which in turn is produced via the shikimate pathway. Phenylalanine is lysated into [[cinnamic acid]], followed by [[hydroxylation]] by [[cinnamate 4-hydroxylase]] to yield [[4-coumaric acid]]. The 4-coumaric acid is again hydroxylated by cinnamate/coumarate 2-hydroxylase to yield 2,4-dihydroxy-cinnamic acid ([[umbellic acid]]) followed by a bond rotation of the unsaturated bond adjacent to the [[carboxylic acid]] group. Finally an intramolecular attack from the hydroxyl group of C2' to the carboxylic acid group closes the ring and forms the [[lactone]] umbelliferone.

=== Synthesis of methoxsalen ===
[[File:DMAPP.png|thumb|[[Dimethylallyl pyrophosphate]]]]
The biosynthetic route then continues with the activation of [[dimethylallyl pyrophosphate]] (DMAPP), produced via the mevalonate pathway, to form a carbo-cation via the cleavage of the diphosphates. Once activated, the enzyme umbelliferone 6-prenyltransferase catalyzes a C-alkylation between DMAPP and umbelliferone at the activated position ortho to the phenol, yielding demethylsuberosin. This is then followed by a hydroxylation catalyzed by the enzyme marmesin synthase to yield [[marmesin]]. Another hydroxylation is catalyzed by [[psoralen synthase]] to yield [[psoralen]]. A third hydroxylation by the enzyme psoralen 8-monooxygenase yields xanthotoxol which is followed by a methylation via the enzyme [[xanthotoxol O-methyltransferase]] and [[S-adenosyl methionine]] to yield methoxsalen.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dewick|first=P. M.|title=Medicinal Natural Products: A Biosynthetic Approach|edition=3rd|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2009|pages=161, 164–165}}</ref>

== Risks and side effects ==
Patients with [[high blood pressure]] or a history of [[liver]] problems are at risk for inflammation and irreparable damage to both liver and skin.  The eyes must be protected from UVA radiation.  Side effects include [[nausea]], [[headache]]s, [[dizziness]], and in rare cases [[insomnia]]. Methoxsalen has also been classified as an [[IARC Group 1 carcinogen]] (known to cause cancer) but is only cancerous when combined with UVA radiation.<ref>http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/othercarcinogens/generalinformationaboutcarcinogens/known-and-probable-human-carcinogens</ref>

== Cultural aspects ==
Author [[John Howard Griffin]] (1920–1980) used the chemical to darken his skin in order to investigate racial segregation in the American South. He wrote the book ''[[Black Like Me (1961)|Black Like Me ]]'' (1961) about his experiences.<ref>[http://www.snopes.com/horrors/freakish/griffin.asp Dead Like Me on snopes.com]</ref>
