'''Erdosteine''' is a [[mucolytic agent|mucolytic]]. Specifically it is a [[thiol]] derivative developed for the treatment of [[chronic bronchitis|chronic obstructive bronchitis]], including acute infective exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. Erdosteine contains two blocked sulfhydryl groups which are released following [[first pass effect|first-pass metabolism]]. The three active metabolites exhibit mucolytic and [[radical (chemistry)|free radical]] scavenging activity. Erdosteine modulates mucus production and viscosity and increases mucociliary transport, thereby improving expectoration. It also exhibits inhibitory activity against the effects of free radicals produced by cigarette smoke.

Clinical studies in patients with [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|chronic obstructive lung disease]] have demonstrated the efficacy and tolerability of erdosteine.<ref>Drugs Exp Clin Res. 2004;30(4):143-52.The effect of long-term treatment with erdosteine on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: the EQUALIFE Study</ref> Erdosteine 300 mg twice daily reduced cough (both frequency and severity) and sputum viscosity more quickly and more effectively than placebo and reduced the adhesivity of sputum more effectively than [[bromhexine]] 30 mg twice daily.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Co-administration of erdosteine and [[amoxicillin]] in patients with acute infective exacerbation of chronic bronchitis resulted in higher concentrations of the antibiotic in the sputum, leading to earlier and more pronounced amelioration of clinical symptoms compared with placebo.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Erdosteine is associated with a low incidence of adverse events, most of which are gastrointestinal and generally mild. The {{LD50}} is very high, 3,500-5,000 mg/kg.
