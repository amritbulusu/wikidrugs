'''Clioquinol''' ('''iodochlorhydroxyquin''') is an [[antifungal drug]] and [[antiprotozoal]] drug.  It is [[neurotoxic]] in large doses.  It is a member of a family of drugs called [[hydroxyquinolines]] which inhibit certain enzymes related to DNA replication.  The drugs have been found to have activity against both [[virus|viral]] and [[protozoal]] infections.<ref name="pmid185949">{{cite journal |vauthors=Rohde W, Mikelens P, Jackson J, Blackman J, Whitcher J, Levinson W |title=Hydroxyquinolines inhibit ribonucleic acid-dependent deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase and inactivate Rous sarcoma virus and herpes simplex virus |journal=Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=234–40 |year=1976 |pmid=185949 |doi= 10.1128/aac.10.2.234|pmc=429727}}</ref>

==Antiprotozoal use==

A 1964 report described the use of Clioquinol in both the treatment and prevention of [[shigella]] infection and ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'' infection in institutionalized individuals at Sonoma State Hospital in California.  The report indicates 4000 individuals were treated over a 4-year period with few side effects.<ref name="pmid14162901">{{cite journal |vauthors=GHOLZ LM, ARONS WL |title=Prophylaxis And Therapy Of Amebiasis And Shigellosis With Iodochlorhydroxyquin |journal=Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. |volume=13 |issue= |pages=396–401 |year=1964 |pmid=14162901 |doi=}}</ref>

Several recently reported journal articles describing its use as an antiprotozoal include:

* A 2005 reference to its use in treating a Dutch family for ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'' infection.<ref name="pmid15651505">{{cite journal |author=Kager PA |title=[Outbreak of amoebiasis in a Dutch family; tropics unexpectedly nearby] |language=Dutch, Flemish |journal=Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde |volume=149 |issue=1 |pages=51–2; author reply 52–3 |year=2005 |pmid=15651505 |doi=}}</ref>
* A 2004 reference to its use in the Netherlands in the treatment of ''[[Dientamoeba fragilis]]'' infection.<ref name="pmid15074181">{{cite journal |vauthors=Bosman DK, Benninga MA, van de Berg P, Kooijman GC, van Gool T |title=[Dientamoeba fragilis: possibly an important cause of persistent abdominal pain in children] |language=Dutch, Flemish |journal=Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde |volume=148 |issue=12 |pages=575–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15074181 |doi=}}</ref>

==Subacute myelo-optic neuropathy==
Clioquinol's use as an [[antiprotozoal]] drug has been restricted or discontinued in some countries due to an event in Japan where over 10,000 people developed [[subacute myelo-optic neuropathy]] (SMON) between 1957 and 1970.  The drug was used widely in many countries before and after the SMON event without similar reports.<ref name="pmid6091394">{{cite journal |author=Wadia NH |title=SMON as seen from Bombay |journal=Acta Neurol. Scand. Suppl. |volume=100 |issue= |pages=159–64 |year=1984 |pmid=6091394 |doi=}}</ref>  As yet, no explanation exists as to why it produced this reaction, and some researchers have questioned whether clioquinol was the causative agent in the disease, noting that the drug had been used for 20 years prior to the epidemic without incident, and that the SMON cases began to reduce in number prior to the discontinuation of the drug.<ref name="pmid127638">{{cite journal |author=Meade TW |title=Subacute myelo-optic neuropathy and clioquinol. An epidemiological case-history for diagnosis |journal=British journal of preventive & social medicine |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=157–69 |year=1975 |pmid=127638 |doi= 10.1136/jech.29.3.157|pmc=478909}}</ref>  Theories suggested have included improper dosing, the permitted use of the drug for extended periods of time,<ref name="pmid15152488">{{cite journal |author=Takasu T |title=[SMON--a model of the iatrogenic disease] |language=Japanese |journal=Rinsho Shinkeigaku |volume=43 |issue=11 |pages=866–9 |year=2003 |pmid=15152488 |doi=}}</ref> and dosing which did not consider the smaller average stature of Japanese; however a dose dependant relationship between SMON development and clioquinol use was never found, suggesting the interaction of another compound.  Researchers have also suggested the SMON epidemic could have been due to a viral infection with an Inoue-Melnick virus.<ref name="pmid9625419">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ito M, Nishibe Y, Inoue YK |title=Isolation of Inoue-Melnick virus from cerebrospinal fluid of patients with epidemic neuropathy in Cuba |journal=Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. |volume=122 |issue=6 |pages=520–2 |year=1998 |pmid=9625419 |doi=}}</ref>

==Topical use==

Clioquinol is a constituent of the prescription medicine Vioform, which is a topical [[Antifungal medication|antifungal]] treatment. It is also used in the form of a cream (and in combination with betamethasone or fluocinolone) in the treatment of inflammatory skin disorders.

==Potential Use as a Preventative or Treatment in Prostate Cancer==
It has long been recognized that normal prostate cells have high zinc content through ZIP1 mediated uptake, and have low respiration (OXPHOS ATP generation is diverted to citrate export for sperm energetics). Prostate cancer cells have downregulated ZIP1 transporters which leads to greater ATP generation which is diverted to cancer proliferation. An example of a normal-like metabolic phenotype instead being malignant (disguised Warburg effect?). The zinc ionophore clioquinol was shown in mice to restore zinc levels and stop the growth of prostate tumors (see Figure 13).<ref name="pmid27132038">{{cite journal |vauthors=Costello LC, Franklin RB |title=A comprehensive review of the role of zinc in normal prostate function and metabolism; and its implications in prostate cancer|journal=Arch Biochem Biophys|volume=611 |issue=1 |pages=100–112 |year=2016 |pmid=27132038|doi=10.1016/j.abb.2016.04.014 |pmc=5083243}}</ref>

==Use in neurodegenerative diseases==

Research at [[University of California, San Francisco|UCSF]] indicates that clioquinol appears to block the genetic action of [[Huntington's disease]] in mice and in cell culture.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Nguyen T, Hamby A, Massa SM |title=Clioquinol down-regulates mutant huntingtin expression in vitro and mitigates pathology in a Huntington's disease mouse model |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=102 |issue=33 |pages=11840–5 |year=2005 |pmid=16087879 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0502177102 |pmc=1187967}}</ref>

Recent animal studies have shown that clioquinol can reverse the progression of Alzheimer's, [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]] and Huntington's diseases.<ref>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=18614028 Rapid restoration of cognition in Alzheimer's transgenic mice with 8-hydroxy quinoline analogs is associated with decreased interstitial Abeta.]</ref> According to Dr. [[Siegfried Hekimi]] and colleagues at [[McGill University|McGill's]] Department of Biology, clioquinol acts directly on a protein called [[Clk-1]], often informally called “clock-1,” and might slow down the aging process. They theorize that this may explain the apparent ability of the drug to be effective in the above conditions, but warn against individuals experimenting with this drug.<ref>[https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/news/item/?item_id=103574]</ref>
