'''Siponimod''' ([[International nonproprietary name|INN]],<ref name="INN">{{cite web|title=International Nonproprietary Names for Pharmaceutical Substances (INN). Recommended International Nonproprietary Names: List 67|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/druginformation/innlists/RL67.pdf|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=18 February 2017|page=86|date=2012}}</ref> code name '''BAF312''') is a selective [[sphingosine-1-phosphate]] [[Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor|receptor]] modulator for oral use that is an [[investigational drug]] for [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS). It is intended for once-daily oral administration.<ref name=Kappos2013>[http://www.neurology.org/cgi/content/meeting_abstract/80/1_MeetingAbstracts/P07.126 Siponimod (BAF312) for the Treatment of Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis: Design of the Phase 3 EXPAND Trial (P07.126)]</ref>

{{As of|2016|1}} it is in a phase III clinical trial for secondary progressive MS due to complete December 2016.

==Clinical trials==
(June 8, 2009) It is in Phase II trial. "A back-up compound for fingolimod, BAF 312" is in Phase II studies.<ref>[http://www.abpi.org.uk/publications/publication_details/targetMS/msandp3.asp#  Multiple sclerosis and the pharmaceutical industry/Medicines in development for MS:] abpi.org.uk  2009</ref> It is being tested for the first time on people having multiple sclerosis. Worldwide 275 patients will participate in this phase II trial the outcome of which is to establish what the optimal dosage of BAF312 is for patients affected with multiple sclerosis for use in further trials. In order to identify "the optimal dosage", participants in group I will be randomly selected to take either placebo, or BAF312 in doses of 0.5&nbsp;mg/day, 2&nbsp;mg/day, or 10&nbsp;mg/day and will be regularly controlled in order to measure and determine the effectiveness, the tolerability and the safety of the dosages. {{update|date=January 2016}}

A phase III trial should run from December 2012 to December 2016.<ref name=NCT01665144>[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01665144 Exploring the Efficacy and Safety of Siponimod in Patients With Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (EXPAND)]</ref>

==Approvals and indications==
None yet

==Mechanism of action==
<!-- initial text copied from [[Multiple Sclerosis research]] -->
Siponimod binds selectively to some of the [[Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor]] forms — including [[Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1]] — found on [[lymphocyte]]s and other cell types.

This binding inhibits the migration of the lymphocytes to the location of the inflammation (e.g. in MS).

Siponimod may be very similar to [[fingolimod]] but preventing [[lymphopenia]], one of its main side effects, by preventing egress of lymphocytes from lymph nodes. Siponimod may be more selective in the particular sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors (8 in number) that it modulates.<ref>{{cite patent|WO|2008000419|title=S1P Receptor modulators for treating multiple sclerosis |url=http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?WO=2008000419&IA=EP2007005597&DISPLAY=DESC |inventor=Hiestand, Peter C; Schnell, Christian |assignee=Novartis}} {{primary-inline|date=November 2013}}</ref> It is selective for the -1 and -5 SIP receptors.<ref name=Kappos2013/>
