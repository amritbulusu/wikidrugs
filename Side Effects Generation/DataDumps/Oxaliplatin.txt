== Medical uses ==
Oxaliplatin is used for treatment of [[colorectal cancer]], typically along with [[folinic acid]] and [[5-fluorouracil]] in a combination known as [[FOLFOX]]. Oxaliplatin has been compared with other platinum compounds used for advanced cancers, such as [[cisplatin]] and [[carboplatin]].

=== Advanced colorectal cancer ===
In clinical studies, oxaliplatin by itself has modest activity against advanced colorectal cancer.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Becouarn Y, Ychou M, Ducreux M, etal | year = 1998 | title = Phase II trial of oxaliplatin as first-line chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer patients.  Digestive Group of French Federation of Cancer Centers | url = | journal = J Clin Oncol | volume = 16 | issue = 8| pages = 2739–44 | pmid = 9704726 }}</ref> When compared with just [[5-fluorouracil]] and [[folinic acid]] administered according to the [[de Gramont regimen]], a FOLFOX4 regime produced no significant increase in overall survival, but did produce an improvement in [[progression-free survival]], the primary end-point of the phase III randomized trial.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=De Gramont A, Figer A, Seymour M, etal | year = 2000 | title = Leucovorin and fluorouracil with or without oxaliplatin as first-line treatment in advanced colorectal cancer | url = | journal = J Clin Oncol | volume = 18 | issue = 16| pages = 2938–47 | pmid = 10944126 }}</ref>

=== Adjuvant treatment of colorectal cancer ===
After and/or before<ref>[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/rectal/HealthProfessional/page4 National Cancer Institute, Rectal Cancer Treatment (PDQ®)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808055320/http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/rectal/HealthProfessional/page4 |date=2014-08-08 }}</ref> the curative resection of colorectal cancer, chemotherapy based on 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid reduces the risk of relapse. The benefit is clinically relevant when cancer has spread to locoregional lymph nodes or penetrated through the wall of the rectum or colon (stage III, Dukes C). The addition of oxaliplatin improves relapse-free survival, but data on overall survival have not yet been published ''in extenso''.

When cancer has not spread to the locoregional lymph nodes, nor penetrated through the wall of the rectum or colon (stage II, Dukes B) the benefit of chemotherapy is marginal{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} and the decision on whether to give adjuvant chemotherapy should be carefully evaluated by discussing with the patient the realistic benefits and the possible toxic side effects of treatment. This is even more relevant when the oncologist proposes treatment with oxaliplatin.{{why|date=February 2016}}

== Adverse effects ==
Side-effects of oxaliplatin treatment can potentially include:
* [[Neurotoxicity]] leading to [[chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy]], a progressive, enduring and often irreversible tingling numbness, intense pain and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes involving the arms and legs, often with deficits in [[proprioception]].<ref name=pasetto>{{cite journal | pmid = 16806962 | doi=10.1016/j.critrevonc.2006.01.001 | volume=59 | issue=2 | title=Oxaliplatin-related neurotoxicity: how and why? |date=August 2006 |vauthors=Pasetto LM, D'Andrea MR, Rossi E, Monfardini S | journal=Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. | pages=159–68}}</ref>
* [[Fatigue (physical)|Fatigue]]
* [[Nausea]], [[vomiting]], or [[diarrhea]]
* [[Neutropenia]] (low number of a type of white blood cells)
* [[Ototoxicity]] (hearing loss)
* [[Extravasation]] if oxaliplatin leaks from the infusion vein it may cause severe damage to the connective tissues.
* [[Hypokalemia]] (low blood potassium), which is more common in women than men<ref name=chay>{{cite journal | pmid = 20092386 | doi=10.3109/02841860903464015 | volume=49 | issue=4 | title=An association between transient hypokalemia and severe acute oxaliplatin-related toxicity predominantly in women |date=May 2010 |vauthors=Chay WY, Chew L, Yeoh TT, Tan MH | journal=Acta Oncol | pages=515–7}}</ref>
* Persistent [[hiccups]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drugs.com/sfx/oxaliplatin-side-effects.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905140215/http://www.drugs.com/sfx/oxaliplatin-side-effects.html |archivedate=2014-09-05 |df= }}</ref>
* [[Rhabdomyolysis]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mein.sanofi.de/produkte/Eloxatin/Downloads?id=dafcc9b3-4397-4205-aeb3-581a3fa90edd |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827232728/https://mein.sanofi.de/produkte/Eloxatin/Downloads?id=dafcc9b3-4397-4205-aeb3-581a3fa90edd |archivedate=2016-08-27 |df= }}</ref>

In addition, some patients may experience an [[allergy|allergic reaction]] to platinum-containing drugs. This is more common in women.<ref name=chay/>

Oxaliplatin has less ototoxicity and [[nephrotoxicity]] than cisplatin and carboplatin.<ref name=pasetto/>

== Structure and mechanism ==
The compound features a [[square planar]] platinum(II) center. In contrast to [[cisplatin]] and [[carboplatin]], oxaliplatin features the [[bidentate]] ligand [[1,2-diaminocyclohexane]] in place of the two [[Denticity|monodentate]] ammine [[ligand]]s. It also features a bidentate [[oxalate]] group.<ref name=App2015/>

According to [[in vivo]] studies, oxaliplatin fights [[carcinoma]] of the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] through non-targeted [[cytotoxic]] effects. Like other platinum compounds, its cytotoxicity is thought to result from inhibition of [[DNA synthesis]] in cells. In particular, oxaliplatin forms both inter- and intra-strand cross links in DNA,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Graham|first=Joanne|author2=Mushin, Mohamed |author3=Kirkpatrick, Peter |title=Oxaliplatin|journal=Nature Reviews Drug Discovery|date=January 2004|volume=3|issue=1|pages=11–2|doi=10.1038/nrd1287|pmid=14756144}}</ref> which prevent DNA replication and transcription, causing cell death.

==History==
Oxaliplatin was discovered in 1976 at [[Nagoya City University]] by Professor Yoshinori Kidani, who was granted U.S. Patent 4,169,846 in 1979. Oxaliplatin was subsequently in-licensed by [[Debiopharm]] and developed as an advanced colorectal cancer treatment. [[Debiopharm]]  licensed the drug to [[Sanofi-Aventis]] in 1994. It gained European approval in 1996 (initially in France) and approval by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] in 2002. [[Generic drug|Generic]] oxaliplatin was first approved in the United States in August 2009.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.drugs.com/availability/generic-eloxatin.html | title=Generic Eloxatin availability | publisher=[[Drugs.com]] | accessdate=19 April 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607135331/http://www.drugs.com/availability/generic-eloxatin.html | archivedate=7 June 2013 | df= }}</ref> Patent disputes caused generic production to stop in 2010, but it restarted in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hospira-announces-us-re-launch-of-generic-oxaliplatin-injection-165568176.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924145942/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hospira-announces-us-re-launch-of-generic-oxaliplatin-injection-165568176.html |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fiercepharma.com/special-reports/top-10-best-selling-cancer-drugs/eloxatin-12-billion | title=Top 10 best-selling cancer drugs: Eloxatin–$1.2 billion | work=FiercePharma | date=15 May 2012 | accessdate=20 April 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421064504/http://www.fiercepharma.com/special-reports/top-10-best-selling-cancer-drugs/eloxatin-12-billion | archivedate=21 April 2014 | df= }}</ref>
