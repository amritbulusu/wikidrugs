'''Clomethiazole''' (also called '''chlormethiazole''') is a [[sedative]] and [[hypnotic]] originally developed by Hoffmann-La Roche in the 1930s.<ref>

}}</ref> The drug is used in treating and preventing symptoms of acute alcohol withdrawal.

It is structurally related to [[thiamine]] (vitamin B<sub>1</sub>), but acts like a sedative, hypnotic, [[muscle relaxant]] and [[anticonvulsant]]. It is also rarely used for the management of [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]], restlessness, short-term [[insomnia]] and [[Parkinson's disease]] in the elderly, when all other treatment options have failed. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], it is sold under the brand '''Heminevrin''' ([[AstraZeneca|AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals]]). Another brand name includes '''Nevrin''' in Romania, '''Distraneurin''' in [[Germany]] and '''Distraneurine''' in Spain. The drug is marketed either as a [[Free base (chemistry)|free base]] in an oily suspension containing 192&nbsp;mg in capsule form, or as clomethiazole [[Ethanedisulfonic acid|edisylate]] syrup. Due to its high toxicity compared to similar drugs it is not recommended as a first-line treatment for any indication and is particularly dangerous to patients with an elevated risk for drug abuse such as those with a personal or familial history of addiction.

== Pharmacology ==
Chlomethiazole acts as a [[Allosteric regulation|positive allosteric modulator]] at the [[barbiturate]]/[[picrotoxin]] site of the [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub>]] [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]. It works to enhance the action of the [[neurotransmitter]] [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]] at this receptor.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain and produces anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative, and hypnotic effects. Chlomethiazole appears to also have another mechanism of action mediating some of its hypothermic and neuroprotective effects.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Adverse effects==
Long term and frequent use of chlomethiazole can cause [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]] and [[physical dependence]]. Abrupt withdrawal may result in symptoms similar to those of sudden withdrawal of alcohol or [[benzodiazepine]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal

}}</ref>

==Overdose==
Chlomethiazole is particularly toxic and dangerous in [[Drug overdose|overdose]] and can be potentially fatal. Alcohol multiplies the effect. As the drug can be fatal in high doses, prescribing clomethiazole outside a controlled environment, like a hospital, is not recommended, especially because there are much less toxic alternatives, such as [[diazepam]]. Diazepam is one of many drugs belonging to the benzodiazepine class, with a long half-life (50–100 hours) and a very low risk of fatal overdose, as long as the patient does not consume alcohol or certain other types of medication.<ref>{{Cite journal

Due to clomethiazole's action at the barbiturate complex the benzodiazepine antidote [[flumazenil]] cannot reverse the effects of overdose; overdose treatment is restricted to the application of a mechanical ventilation apparatus until enough of the drug has been metabolized and/or excreted for the patient to breathe sufficiently without assistance. As with all GABA<sub>A</sub> agonists/allosteric agonists chomethiazole has a high potential for misuse and abuse, and intentional overdoses have been documented.

Drummer [[Keith Moon]] of the rock band [[The Who]] died of a clomethiazole overdose.<ref name="lastinterview">{{cite web |url=http://www.openculture.com/2013/05/keith_moons_last_interview_1978.html |title=Keith Moon's Last Interview, 1978 |last=Springer |first=Mike |date=2013-05-20 |accessdate=2014-10-11 |quote=An autopsy showed that Moon had taken 32 tablets of Clomethiazole. His doctor had told him not to exceed three per day. }}</ref>
