'''Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Limited''' is a multinational South African holding company for pharmaceutical concerns,<ref name="bloombergprofile" /> and the largest drug company in Africa.<ref name="simeon2010" /><ref name="Meléndez-OrtizRoffe2009" />

== History ==

=== Activity in HIV/AIDS-related medicines ===
After complaints of anticompetitive activities by [[Boehringer Ingelheim]] and [[GlaxoSmithKline]] in 2003, Aspen was granted licenses from the companies to create generic versions of [[antiretrovirals]] (ARV) for use in the [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Sub-Saharan]] portion of Africa.<ref name="OseweNkrumah2008" /> At the time, Aspen was already the largest generic medicine distributor in South Africa.<ref name="OseweNkrumah2008" /> Subsequent inspections by international organizations led to a rapid increase in distribution capabilities, primarily though integration with alliance partners.<ref name="OseweNkrumah2008" />  The company's efforts led to expanded access to affordable treatments for HIV/AIDS.<ref name="LoucheIdowu2010" />

===Price-gouging===
Aspen has been criticised for increasing the prices of generic drugs it sells. It was fined for price-gouging in Italy where it paid $5.5m in October 2016 for its behaviour. It has been accused of the same practices, including artificially restricting supply, in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, France and Brazil. In France 3 people died after being given [[cyclophosphamide]], an alternative drug to Aspen's [[melphalan]] which had gone up in price. An investigation is currently ongoing.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/28/nhs-drug-firms-cancer-patients-at-risk-prices-inflated|title=Drugs firms are accused of putting cancer patients at risk over price hikes|first=Sarah Boseley Health|last=Editor|date=28 January 2017|publisher=|accessdate=14 April 2017|via=The Guardian}}</ref>

Similarly, Aspen's [[busulfan]], a treatment for [[chronic myeloid leukaemia]], was bought by the UK's [[NHS]] for 21p for 2mg in 2011, rising to £2.61 in 2016, a hike of 1,143%.<ref name="auto"/>

The Guardian newspaper has linked this activity to a rise in Aspen's share price. Between 2009 and 2016 it rose more than 650% and GSK sold its shares in Aspen earning about £1.5bn.<ref name="auto"/>

In May 2017, the European Commission announced it would open an investigation into Aspen's pricing practices.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-aspen-pharmacare-idUSKCN18B11M|title=Aspen under EU antitrust spotlight over excessive cancer drug prices|date=15 May 2017|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-06-19}}</ref>

=== Thyrax shortage in The Netherlands ===
January 2016, Aspen announced that due to production problems, tablets with 0.025mg Thyrax would not be available from mid-2106. Later, it was announced that this shortage would last well into 2017.  People who took this medication had to switch to alternatives, which led to 30% of them experiencing side-effects because of this shift.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.knmp.nl/downloads/eindrapport-nivel-tekort-thyrax-duotab.pdf|title=Report about the effects on patients that had to switch from thyrax|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>

== Products ==
As of 2007 Aspen supplied more than 650 branded medicines, specialising in generics and treatments for [[HIV/AIDS]] and [[tuberculosis]].<ref name="Meléndez-OrtizRoffe2009"/>
