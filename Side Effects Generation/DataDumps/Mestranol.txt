==Pharmacology==
Mestranol is the 3-[[methyl]] [[ether]] of [[ethinylestradiol]],<ref name="Elks2014" /> and is a biologically inactive [[prodrug]] of ethinylestradiol to which it is [[demethylation|demethylated]] in the [[liver]] with a conversion efficiency of 70% (50&nbsp;µg of mestranol is [[pharmacokinetic]]ally [[bioequivalent]] to 35&nbsp;µg of ethinylestradiol, or ethinylestradiol being about 1.7 times as orally potent by weight as mestranol).<ref name=faigle>{{cite book |author1=Faigle, Johann W. |author2=Schenkel, Lotte |editor1=in Fraser |editor2=Ian S. |year=1998 |chapter=Pharmacokinetics of estrogens and progestogens |title=Estrogens and Progestogens in Clinical Practice |pages=273–294 |location=London |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |isbn=0-443-04706-5}}</ref><ref name="FalconeHurd2007">{{cite book|author1=Tommaso Falcone|author2=William W.

==History==
In April 1956, [[noretynodrel]] was investigated, in [[Puerto Rico]], in the first large-scale [[clinical trial]] of a [[progestogen]] as an oral contraceptive.<ref name="Sneader2005">{{cite book|author=Walter Sneader|title=Drug Discovery: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cb6BOkj9fK4C&pg=PA202|date=23 June 2005|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-471-89979-2|pages=202–}}</ref><ref name="LentzLobo2012">{{cite book|author1=Gretchen M.

Around 1969, mestranol was replaced by ethinylestradiol in most or all combined oral contraceptives due to widespread panic about the recently uncovered increased risk of [[venous thromboembolism]] with estrogen-containing oral contraceptives.<ref name="Aronson2009">{{cite book|author=Jeffrey K.
