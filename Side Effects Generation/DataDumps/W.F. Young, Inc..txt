Private Company Information – Business Week|publisher=Investing.businessweek.com|accessdate=2012-11-19}}</ref> These brands and products are sold online, in farm, feed, and tack shops, and pet retailers.

The corporation was founded in 1892 by Wilbur Fenelon Young and Mary Ida Young and has been family owned and run by the Young family since 1892. Its headquarters are in [[East Longmeadow, Massachusetts]].

==Founder's History==
Wilbur Fenelon Young was born on November 18, 1863 in [[Wallingford, Connecticut]] to Charles and Julia Tyler (Hine). On June 24, 1887 Wilbur married his first wife, Sadie Wilcox, who died in 1891. A year later, on November 16, 1892, he married Mary Ida Stephenson Young. Mary Ida was born on June 29, 1865 in Stonington, [[Maryland]]. Her parents were Thomas Bronson and Amelia F. (Stone) Stephenson. Mary Ida was a descendant of Thomas Stone, the first Protestant governor of Maryland and a signer of the [[Declaration of Independence]]. Together Wilbur and Mary Ida had two children, Wilbur II and Sally.

==Company history==
W.F. Young, Inc. is an American company founded by Wilbur F. and Mary Ida Young in 1892 in [[Meriden, Connecticut]]. Wilbur delivered cargo with a team of workhorses while Mary Ida cared for the horses and home.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.umassmag.com/2009/Spring_09/features/horse-sense.html|title=W.F. Young Heritage-Horse Sense|publisher=UMASS Amherst}}</ref> In 1892, "blistering"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esc.rutgers.edu/ask_expert/ate_emo.htm#blist|title=Ask the Expert-Equine Management |publisher=Esc.rutgers.edu |date=2012-09-14 |accessdate=2012-11-19}}</ref> was a common practice done to heal horse muscles, tendons, and joints faster when they were strained. The purpose was allow more blood to enter the area to heal the skin as it was believed that the injured joint would benefit from the extra blood flow. Wilbur and Mary Ida disapproved of this harsh method of treatment. Mary Ida was a [[herbalist]], and formulated a [[liniment]] of menthol, wormwood oil, and herbs in her kitchen tub as an alternative to blistering, which she named Absorbine Veterinary Liniment.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wfyoung.com/ourstory/|title=Our Story |publisher=Wfyoung.com|accessdate=2012-11-19}}</ref>

The couple then founded W.F. Young, P.D.F. to market and sell the liniment. As neighboring farmers and drivers tried the liniment on their own horses, it grew in popularity. In 1893, W.F. Young, P.D.F. moved to [[Springfield, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.absorbine.com/our-story/news-press-releases/wf-young-inc-celebrates-115-years-as-an-industry-leader-and-innovator|title=W.F. Young, Inc. Celebrates 115 Years as an Industry|publisher=Wfyoung.com|accessdate=2012-11-19}}</ref>

A few years later, Wilbur was inspired by his son to create a version of the liniment for humans, and Absorbine Jr. was introduced in 1903.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.absorbinejr.com/about/history/|title=Absobrbine Jr. History|publisher=Absorbinejr.com|accessdate=2012-11-19}}</ref> Today, Absorbine Jr. products can be found in grocery, retailer supercenters, and drug stores. It is reported that the development of Absorbine Jr. was partially inspired by stories of local farmers using the Veterinary Liniment on themselves after a hard day's work.

After Wilbur Fenelon Young's death in 1918, Wilbur F. Young II took over the business at 20 years old. The following year, in 1919, W.F. Young, P.D.F. was incorporated to become W.F. Young, Inc. as it is known today.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.absorbine.com/our-story/news-press-releases/wf-young-inc-celebrates-115-years-as-an-industry-leader-and-innovator|title=W.F. Young, Inc. Celebrates 115 Years as an Industry|publisher=Wfyoung.com|accessdate=2012-11-19}}</ref> W.F. Young Inc. moved to Lyman Street in Springfield, Massachusetts in 1923.

When Wilbur II died in 1928, Mary Ida took over the business from her son. She ran the business until 1957, when her daughter, Sadie Stephenson (Sally) Young, and grandson Wilbur F. Young III were each promoted to president. Mary Ida Stephenson Young died on October 31, 1960 at age 95. Following Sally Young's death in 1977, Wilbur III became the sole president. He was president for 10 years until his death in 1987. At that time, Wilbur III's son, Tyler Young, became President and CEO.

W.F. Young, Inc. acquired the Equine America company and products on November 1, 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.masslive.com/business/republican/index.ssf?/base/business-2/119451042710260.xml&coll=1|title=W.F. Young Inc. Buys SC Firm|publisher=Masslive.com|accessdate=2012-11-19}}</ref> Equine America products include supplements, grooming aids, and muscle & joint relief.

On October 15, 2008 the board of directors at W.F. Young, Inc. appointed Adam D. Raczkowski as President of the company, with Tyler F. Young retaining his current role of CEO.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tntmagissues.tackntogs.com/tnt/08_TNT_11/tnt27_1108.pdf|title=Raczkwoski named President of W.F. Young, Inc.|publisher=Tackntogs.com|accessdate=2012-11-19}}</ref>

In 2012, W.F. Young, Inc. underwent a strategic reorganization of the business to focus exclusively on animal care.  They continued to grow their equine care product lines and expanded their offerings into the livestock<ref>http://www.absorbine.com/our-story/news-press-releases/Flys-X-Insect-Control-for-Multi-Species-Use</ref> and companion pet<ref>http://www.absorbine.com/our-story/news-press-releases/Appoints-Director-of-New-Pet-Care-Division</ref> categories. With this change, W.F. Young divested itself of its human healthcare division. In 2013, DSE Healthcare took on the Absorbine Jr. brand.

In 2013, the Equine America line of products was discontinued in the United States in an effort to focus on the growth of the Absorbine line. This led to the decision to move key Equine America brand products into the Absorbine family of products. B-L and Fungasol are now sold under the Absorbine name. The remaining Equine America products are available outside of the U.S. only.

In 2015, Tyler F. Young was promoted to Executive Chairman of the Board, with Adam D. Raczkowski taking over as CEO. Chris Jacobi, who had been serving as the general manager of the equine division, was appointed as President.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wfyoung.com/w-f-young-inc-absorbine-announces-strategic-management-promotions/|title=W.
