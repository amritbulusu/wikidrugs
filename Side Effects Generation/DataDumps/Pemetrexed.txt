===Carboplatin===
Pemetrexed is also recommended in combination with [[carboplatin]] for the first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer.<ref>Ettinger DS et al.

===Supplementation===
Patients should take [[folic acid]] and [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] supplement even if levels are normal when they are on pemetrexed therapy.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hazarika M, White RM, Johnson JR, Pazdur R |title=FDA drug approval summaries: pemetrexed (Alimta) |journal=Oncologist |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=482–8 |year=2004 |pmid=15477632 |doi=10.1634/theoncologist.9-5-482 |url=http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15477632}}</ref><ref>{{cite web

==Mechanism of action==
[[File:Pathway of tetrahydrofolate and antimetabolites.pdf|thumb|Pathway of tetrahydrofolate and antimetabolites]]
Pemetrexed is chemically similar to [[folic acid]] and is in the class of chemotherapy drugs called [[folate antimetabolite]]s.  It works by inhibiting three enzymes used in [[purine]] and [[pyrimidine]] synthesis—[[thymidylate synthase]] (TS), [[dihydrofolate reductase]] (DHFR), and [[glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase]]<ref>{{Cite journal

==History==
The molecular structure of pemetrexed was developed by [[Edward C. Taylor]] at [[Princeton University]] and clinically developed by Indianapolis-based drug maker, [[Eli Lilly and Company]] in 2004.

It has been researched in the [[PARAMOUNT trial]].

==Society and culture==
=== Trade names ===
In addition to the brand name ''Alimta'', this drug is also marketed in India by Abbott Healthcare as ''Pleumet'' and by [[Cadila Healthcare]] as  ''Pemecad''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Cost===
In the United States as of 2015 each vial of medicine costs between 2,623 and 3,100 USD.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Langreth|first1=Robert|title=Decoding Big Pharma’s Secret Drug Pricing Practices|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-drug-prices/|accessdate=15 July 2016|publisher=Bloomberg|date=June 29, 2016}}</ref>
