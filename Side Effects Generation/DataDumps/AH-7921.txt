'''AH-7921''' is an [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] drug selective for the [[mu opioid receptor|µ-opioid receptor]], having around 80% the potency of [[morphine]] when administered orally.<ref>{{cite journal | first1=R.

==Use==
Although AH-7921 was extensively studied in vitro and in animals, though not in humans, by the developing company, it was never sold commercially for medical use. In 2013, AH-7921 was discovered to have been used as an active ingredient in "[[synthetic cannabis]]" products in Japan.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11419-013-0182-9 | title=Two new-type cannabimimetic quinolinyl carboxylates, QUPIC and QUCHIC, two new cannabimimetic carboxamide derivatives, ADB-FUBINACA and ADBICA, and five synthetic cannabinoids detected with a thiophene derivative α-PVT and an opioid receptor agonist AH-7921 identified in illegal products |author1=Nahoko Uchiyama |author2=Satoru Matsuda |author3=Maiko Kawamura |author4=Ruri Kikura-Hanajiri |author5=Yukihiro Goda | journal=Forensic Toxicology |date=July 2013  | volume=31 | issue=2 | pages=223–240 | doi=10.1007/s11419-013-0182-9}}</ref>
In October 2015, two horses (Bossmon and Literata) trained by owner-trainer Roy Sedlacek tested positive for AH-7921 at Belmont Park racetrack.<ref>{{cite web|title=Two horses test positive for designer drug|url=http://www.racingpost.com/news/horse-racing/usa-two-horses-test-positive-for-designer-drug/1987810/|website=Racing Post|accessdate=29 April 2016}}</ref>

==Legality==
AH-7921 was made a [[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons#Schedule 9: prohibited substance|Prohibited Substance]] (Schedule 9 of the [[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons]]) in Australia in May 2014.<ref>[https://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/scheduling-decisions-1405-final.pdf Final decisions and reasons for decisions by delegates of the Secretary to the Department of Health]</ref>  Although this amendment was repealed in June 2014,<ref>[https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2014L00566 Poisons Standard Amendment No. 2 of 2014]</ref> which simply means the amendment document ceases, but the actual scheduling is permanent as part of the main document (all SUSMP amendments cease after a few weeks).  It may, however, still be a banned import.

AH-7921 has been illegal to distribute in Israel since December 2013.<ref>[http://www.nevo.co.il/Law_word/law01/P170_001.doc פקודת הסמים המסוכנים נוסח חדש, תשל"ג-1973]</ref>

In Brazil, AH-7921 has been an illegal drug since May 2015.<ref>[http://portal.anvisa.gov.br/documents/10181/2879690/(1)RDC_87_2016.pdf/ Resolução da Diretoria Colegiada - RDC nº 87 de 28/06/2016]</ref>

As of October 2015 AH-7921 is a controlled substance in China.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sfda.gov.cn/WS01/CL0056/130753.html | title=关于印发《非药用类麻醉药品和精神药品列管办法》的通知 | publisher=China Food and Drug Administration | date=27 September 2015 | language=Chinese | accessdate=1 October 2015}}</ref>

AH-7921 is banned in the Czech Republic.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mzcr.cz/Admin/_upload/files/3/Nov%C3%A9%20PL.pdf | title=Látky, o které byl doplněn seznam č. 4 psychotropních látek (příloha č. 4 k nařízení  vlády č. 463/2013 Sb.) | publisher=Ministerstvo zdravotnictví | language=Czech}}</ref>

In the United States, AH-7921 was placed into Schedule I of the [[Controlled Substances Act]] on May 16, 2016.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/rules/2016/fr0414_4.htm | title=Schedules of Controlled Substances: Placement of AH-7921 Into Schedule I | publisher=Drug Enforcement Administration | date=14 April 2016}}</ref>

The Canadian [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act]] was amended in 2016 to include the substance as a Schedule I substance. Possession without legal authority can result in maximum 7 years imprisonment. Further, [[Health Canada]] amended the ''Food and Drug Regulations'' in May, 2016 to classify AH-7921 as a restricted drug.<ref>[http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2016/2016-06-01/html/sor-dors106-eng.php Regulations Amending the Food and Drug Regulations (Parts G and J — Lefetamine, AH-7921, MT-45 and W-18)]</ref> Only those with a law enforcement agency, person with an exemption permit or institutions with Minister's authorization may possess the drug in Canada.
