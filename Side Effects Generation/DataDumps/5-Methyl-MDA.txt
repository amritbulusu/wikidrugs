'''5-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine''' ('''5-Methyl-MDA''') is an [[entactogen]] and [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] [[designer drug]] of the [[substituted amphetamine|amphetamine]] class. It is a [[functional group|ring]]-[[methyl]]ated [[Homology (chemistry)|homologue]] of [[3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine|MDA]] and a [[structural isomer]] of [[3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine|MDMA]].<ref name="pmid9526575">{{cite journal | vauthors = Parker MA, Marona-Lewicka D, Kurrasch D, Shulgin AT, Nichols DE | title = Synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of ring-methylated derivatives of 3,4-(methylenedioxy)amphetamine (MDA) | journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 41 | issue = 6 | pages = 1001–5 |date=March 1998 | pmid = 9526575 | doi = 10.1021/jm9705925 }}</ref>

==Effects and research==
{{contradict section|date=June 2016}}
{{reliable sources| section|date=June 2016}}
[[Classical conditioning|Drug discrimination]] studies showed that 5-methyl-MDA substitutes for MDA, [[5-methoxy-6-methyl-2-aminoindane|MMAI]], and [[lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], but not [[amphetamine]], suggesting that it produces a mix of entactogen and hallucinogenic effects without any [[stimulant]] effects.<ref name="urlSynthesis of 5-Methyl-MDA - [www.rhodium.ws]">{{cite web | url = http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/5-methyl-mda.html | title = Synthesis of 5-Methyl-MDA - [www.rhodium.ws] | date = | work = | publisher = | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = }}</ref>

5-Methyl-MDA acts as a [[selective serotonin releasing agent]] (SSRA) with [[IC50|IC<sub>50</sub>]] values of 107nM, 11,600nM, and 1,494nM for [[serotonin]], [[dopamine]], and [[norepinephrine]] efflux.<ref name="pmid9526575" /> It is over 5x more potent than MDA, with a suitable active dose possibly being around 15–25&nbsp;mg.<ref name="pmid9526575" /><ref name="urlSynthesis of 5-Methyl-MDA - [www.rhodium.ws]" /> Subsequent testing, however, has found that it is not as potent as once thought and is active at at least 100mg. [[2-Methyl-MDA]] is also much more potent than MDA, but is not quite as potent as 5-methyl-MDA.<ref name="pmid9526575" /> [[Madam-6|6-methyl-MDMA]] (also known as Madam-6) is mostly inactive, likely due to [[steric hindrance]].<ref name="pmid9526575" /><ref>[http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal098.shtml PIHKAL #98]</ref>

Recent research has used data on 2-methyl-MDA and 5-methyl-MDA to help guide computer modeling of the [[serotonin transporter]] complex.<ref name="pmid18354055">{{cite journal | vauthors = Walline CC, Nichols DE, Carroll FI, Barker EL | title = Comparative molecular field analysis using selectivity fields reveals residues in the third transmembrane helix of the serotonin transporter associated with substrate and antagonist recognition | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 325 | issue = 3 | pages = 791–800 |date=June 2008 | pmid = 18354055 | pmc = 2637348 | doi = 10.1124/jpet.108.136200 | url = http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18354055 | issn = }}</ref>

==Legal status==
5-Methyl-MDA is not scheduled by the [[United Nations]]' [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]].<ref name="UNCPS">[https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/commissions/CND/conventions.html Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971]</ref>

===United States===
5-Methyl-MDA is not [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedules of controlled substances|scheduled]] at the [[Federal government of the United States|federal level]] in the [[United States]],<ref name="PART 1308 — SCHEDULES OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES - 1308.11 Schedule I">[http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1308/1308_11.htm §1308.11 Schedule I.]</ref> but it is possible that 5-Methyl-MDA could legally be considered an [[Structural analog#Chemistry|analog]] of [[3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine|MDA]], in which case, sales or [[Drug possession|possession]] could potentially be prosecuted under the [[Federal Analogue Act]].<ref>[https://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/law/analog/analog_info1.shtml Erowid Analog Law Vault : Federal Controlled Substance Analogue Act Summary]</ref>
