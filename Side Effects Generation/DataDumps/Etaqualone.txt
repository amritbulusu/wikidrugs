It has [[sedative]], [[hypnotic]], [[muscle relaxant]] and [[central nervous system depressant]] properties resulting from its agonist activity at the β-subtype of the [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor]], and was used for the treatment of [[insomnia]].

The dosage and effects are reported to be similar to those of methaqualone, but shorter acting and slightly weaker.
Typical reports use between 50 and 500&nbsp;mg of etaqualone, depending on desired effects. Old pharmaceutical formulations of Ethinazone were 350&nbsp;mg tablets. 
Etaqualone is thought to act in a similar way to barbiturates and benzodiazepines by increasing the sensitivity of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Recreational effects include euphoria, relaxation, increased sociability and sexuality, reduction of short-term memory, and loss of coordination. Combination with other depressants has a potentiating effect and can cause overdose. Tolerance to benzodiazepines or alcohol will also reduce effects.

Ethaqualone can be present as a free base, insoluble in water but soluble in alcohol and nonpolar solvents, or as a water-soluble hydrochloride salt which is about 85% as potent as the freebase by weight.

The most common route of administration of ethaqualone is oral, but snorting the salt or smoking the free base have also been reported.
