'''Alfentanil''' ('''R-39209''', trade name '''Alfenta''', '''Rapifen''' in Australia) is a potent but short-acting synthetic [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] [[medication|drug]], used for [[anaesthesia]] in [[surgery]].  It is an analogue of [[fentanyl]] with around 1/4 to 1/10 the potency of fentanyl and around 1/3 of the duration of action, but with an onset of effects 4x faster than fentanyl.<ref>[http://www.google.com/patents?id=msJ_AAAAEBAJ&dq=7208604 Jacob Mathew, J. Kendall Killgore. Methods for the synthesis of alfentanil, sufentanil, and remifentanil. US Patent 7,208,604]</ref> Alfentanil has a pKa of approximately 6.5, which leads to a very high proportion of the drug being uncharged at physiologic pH.  This unique characteristic is responsible for its rapid onset. It is an agonist at [[mu opioid receptor]]s.

While alfentanil tends to cause fewer [[cardiovascular]] complications than other similar drugs such as [[fentanyl]] and [[remifentanil]], it tends to give stronger [[respiratory depression]] and so requires careful monitoring of breathing and vital signs. Almost exclusively used by anesthesia providers during portions of a case where quick, fast acting (though not long lasting) pain control is needed (i.e. during a nerve block, head pinning etc..) Alfentanil is administered by the [[wikt:Parenteral|parenteral]] (injected) route for fast onset of effects and precise control of dosage.

Alfentanil is a restricted drug which is classified as [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule II drugs|Schedule II]] in the USA, according to the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|U.S. DEA]] website.<ref name="http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/listby_sched/sched2.htm">[http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/listby_sched/sched2.htm From DEA website, accessed 23 Jan 2007]</ref>

Alfentanil was discovered at [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]] in 1976.

Side effects of [[fentanyl]] analogs are similar to those of fentanyl itself, which include [[itching]], [[nausea]] and potentially serious [[respiratory depression]], which can be life-threatening. Fentanyl analogs have killed hundreds of people throughout Europe and the former Soviet republics since the most recent resurgence in use began in Estonia in the early 2000s, and novel derivatives continue to appear.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.ijdp.org/article/S0955-3959%2815%2900097-3/abstract | title=Fentanyls: Are we missing the signs?
