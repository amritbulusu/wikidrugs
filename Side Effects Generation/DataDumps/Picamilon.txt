'''Picamilon''' (also known as '''N-nicotinoyl-GABA''', '''pycamilon''', and '''pikamilon''') is a drug formed by a synthetic combination of [[niacin]] and [[Gamma-aminobutyric acid|GABA]]. It was developed in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1969<ref name=" Some approaches to the directed search for new drugs based on nicotinic acid">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kopelevich VM, Gunar VI | title =  Some approaches to the directed search for new drugs based on nicotinic acid | journal = Pharmaceutical Chemistry Journal | volume = 33 | issue = 4 | pages = 177–187 |date=April 1999 | pmid =  | doi = 10.1007/BF02509934 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/r8430r0l4x596027/ }}</ref> and further studied in both [[Russia]]<ref name="pmid2707413">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mirzoian RS, Gan'shina TS | title = [The new cerebrovascular preparation pikamilon] | language = Russian | journal = Farmakologiia i Toksikologiia | volume = 52 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–6 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2707413 | doi =  }}</ref> and [[Japan]] as a [[prodrug]] of GABA.<ref name="pmid6529802">{{cite journal | vauthors = Matsuyama K, Yamashita C, Noda A, Goto S, Noda H, Ichimaru Y, Gomita Y | title = Evaluation of isonicotinoyl-gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and nicotinoyl-GABA as pro-drugs of GABA | journal = Chemical & Pharmaceutical Bulletin | volume = 32 | issue = 10 | pages = 4089–95 | date = Oct 1984 | pmid = 6529802 | doi = 10.1248/cpb.32.4089 | url = http://www.journalarchive.jst.go.jp/english/jnlabstract_en.php?cdjournal=cpb1958&cdvol=32&noissue=10&startpage=4089 }}</ref>

In Russia, picamilon is sold as a prescription drug. The rights to the drug belong to the Russian pharmaceutical company NPK ECHO ("НПК ЭХО"). It is not approved for sale in the United States and has been deemed as an adulterating agent in [[dietary supplements]], with five American companies required to remove their picamilon products from the market in November, 2015.<ref name="nutra">{{cite web | url = http://www.nutraingredients-usa.com/Regulation/FDA-sends-five-warning-letters-over-supplements-containing-picamilon/?c=7InNqGv0AjdjxWpyk%2BfGQw%3D%3D&p2= | title = FDA sends five warning letters over supplements containing picamilon | date = 2 December 2015 | publisher = NutraIngredients-USA.com, William Reed Business Media|accessdate=3 December 2015}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action and potential therapeutic applications==
One study in animals showed that picamilon permeated the [[blood–brain barrier]]<ref name="pmid1884802">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dorofeev BF, Kholodov LE | title = [Pikamilon pharmacokinetics in animals] | language = Russian | journal = Farmakologiia i Toksikologiia | volume = 54 | issue = 2 | pages = 66–9 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1884802 | doi =  }}</ref> and then is [[hydrolyzed]] into GABA and niacin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://picamilon.org/|title=Technical Description of Picamilon}}</ref> The released GABA in theory would activate [[GABA receptor]]s potentially producing an [[anxiolytic]] response.<ref name="pmid2884549">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shephard RA | title = Behavioral effects of GABA agonists in relation to anxiety and benzodiazepine action | journal = Life Sciences | volume = 40 | issue = 25 | pages = 2429–36 | date = Jun 1987 | pmid = 2884549 | doi = 10.1016/0024-3205(87)90758-2 }}</ref> The second released component, [[niacin]], is a [[vasodilator]].<ref name="pmid17705685">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gille A, Bodor ET, Ahmed K, Offermanns S | title = Nicotinic acid: pharmacological effects and mechanisms of action | journal = Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology | volume = 48 | issue =  | pages = 79–106 | year = 2008 | pmid = 17705685 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.48.113006.094746 }}</ref><ref name="pmid15673472">{{cite journal | vauthors = Prousky J, Seely D | title = The treatment of migraines and tension-type headaches with intravenous and oral niacin (nicotinic acid): systematic review of the literature | journal = Nutrition Journal | volume = 4 | issue =  | pages = 3 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15673472 | pmc = 548511 | doi = 10.1186/1475-2891-4-3 }}</ref>

== Detection in biological fluids ==
Plasma picamilon concentrations are generally in the 500–3000 ''μ''g/L range during the first few hours after single oral doses of 50–200&nbsp;mg with a [[half-life]] of 1–2 hours.<ref name="cui">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cui W, Chen X, Zhan Y, Zhang Z, Zhang Y, Zhong D | title = Determination of picamilon concentration in human plasma by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry | journal = Journal of Chromatography B | volume = 878 | issue = 15-16 | pages = 1181–4 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20359966 | doi = 10.1016/j.jchromb.2010.03.013 }}</ref> The drug undergoes hydrolysis to GABA and nicotinic acid. Urinary excretion of parent drug and the two metabolites accounts for up to 79% of a single dose.<ref name="cui"/>

== Regulation ==
In the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] ruled in 2015 that picamilon does not fit any of the dietary ingredient categories in the [[Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994]],<ref name="nutra"/><ref>{{cite web | last1 = Welch | first1 = Cara| name-list-format = vanc | title = Declaration of Dr. Cara Welch|url=https://blog.priceplow.com/wp-content/uploads/Picamilon-FDA_Ruling-20150928.pdf|publisher=Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=21 October 2015}}</ref> namely that it is not a [[vitamin]]; a [[dietary mineral]]; an [[herb]] or other [[botanical]]; an [[amino acid]]; a dietary substance for use by humans to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any ingredient described above. This led to the removal of picamilon as a pure substance or from various supplements manufactured in the US.<ref name="nutra"/><ref>{{cite web | last1 = Roberto | first1 = Mike | name-list-format = vanc | title = Picamilon Under FDA Attack | url = https://blog.priceplow.com/supplement-news/picamilon-fda|website=PricePlow | accessdate = 21 October 2015 | date = 13 October 2015 }}</ref>
