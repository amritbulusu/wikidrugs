'''Buphedrone''', also known as '''α-methylamino-butyrophenone''' ('''MABP'''), is a [[stimulant]] of the [[substituted phenethylamine|phenethylamine]] and [[substituted cathinone|cathinone]] [[chemical class]]es that was first [[Organic synthesis|synthesized]] in 1928.<ref>Hyde JF, Browning E, Adams R. Synthetic Homologs of d, l-Ephedrine. ''Journal of the American Chemical Society''. 1928; 50(8):2287–2292. {{doi|10.1021/ja01395a032}}</ref> It is legal in most countries as a [[research chemical]], as long as it is not intended for human consumption.

== Chemistry ==
Buphedrone is a beta-ketone and is related to the naturally occurring compounds, [[cathinone]] and [[cathine]]. It is also related to [[methamphetamine]], differing by the β-[[ketone]] substituent (at the beta carbon) and an [[ethyl group]] replacing the [[methyl]] group at the carbon alpha to the [[amine]].
One other name for Buphedrone is : Phenylacetoethyl-methylamine

Buphedrone as free base is very unstable; the [[ketone]] is readily reduced to a [[hydroxyl]] group, thus forming the corresponding [[alcohol]]. Structurally, this occurs when the C=O bond at the Rβ-position is converted into a C-OH bond. Because of this, it is sold as various salts, with a [[hydrochloride]] being most common.

== Effects ==
Buphedrone increases spontaneous rodent [[Animal locomotion|locomotor]] activity, potentiates the release of [[dopamine]] from [[dopaminergic]] [[nerve]] terminals in the [[brain]], and causes [[appetite suppression]]. It also causes a possibly dangerous effect of decreasing subjective feeling of thirst. The effects of buphedrone have also been compared to [[methamphetamine]], with more euphoria and less physical stimulation. Most commonly reported effects include:

* Elevated mood, [[euphoria]]
* Increased alertness
* Dilated [[pupil]]s (rare)
* Slurred speech (rare)
* Increased heart rate
* Talkativeness
* Increased empathy and sense of communication
* Increased sex drive
* Temporary erectile dysfunction in men
* Restlessness
* Insomnia
* Increased motivation

Depending on the route of administration, the duration varies from approximately 2.5 (IV) to 6 hours (orally) and may be followed by unpleasant symptoms associated with [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]], which may include:
* Dysphoria
* Tiredness
* Sweating
* Loss of concentration

==Legal Status==

As of October 2015 Buphedrone is a controlled substance in China.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sfda.gov.cn/WS01/CL0056/130753.html | title=关于印发《非药用类麻醉药品和精神药品列管办法》的通知 | publisher=China Food and Drug Administration | date=27 September 2015 | language=Chinese | accessdate=1 October 2015}}</ref>

Buphedrone is an [[Drugs controlled by the German Betäubungsmittelgesetz|Anlage II]] controlled drug in Germany.
