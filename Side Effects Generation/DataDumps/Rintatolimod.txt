==Mechanism of action==

One mode of action of this drug is to protect and stimulate the [[innate immune system]], also called the nonspecific immune system, and the first line of defense. According to a study published in the [[Journal of Immunology]]<ref name="J Immuno">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gowen BB, Wong MH, Jung KH, Sanders AB, Mitchell WM, Alexopoulou L, Flavell RA, Sidwell RW | title = TLR3 is essential for the induction of protective immunity against Punta Toro Virus infection by the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), poly(I:C12U), but not Poly(I:C): differential recognition of synthetic dsRNA molecules | journal = J.

TLR-3 receptors are located on cell surfaces. They are part of a family of "pattern recognition" receptors that detect pathogens immediately, even those the body has not yet encountered, long before [[adaptive immunity]] can intervene against foreign invaders. These receptors are critical to the first line of immunological defense against a broad range of pathogens, including otherwise lethal viruses and various forms of cancer. When, for example, double-stranded RNA molecules from an RNA viral infection bind to TLR-3 receptors, the virus in this way inactivates the innate immune system, rendering it unable to signal the rest of the body's defenses. When rintatolimod binds to TLR-3 receptors, the virus cannot do so, and the body is able to marshal its defenses and launch an assault on the virus.

The mechanism of rintatolimod in relation to CFS is not certain, but is thought to include the [[RNase L]] enzyme.<ref name="pmid7893988">{{cite journal |vauthors=Suhadolnik RJ, Reichenbach NL, Hitzges P, Adelson ME, Peterson DL, Cheney P, Salvato P, Thompson C, Loveless M, Müller WE | title = Changes in the 2-5A synthetase/RNase L antiviral pathway in a controlled clinical trial with poly(I)-poly(C12U) in chronic fatigue syndrome | journal = In Vivo (Athens, Greece) | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 599–604 | year = 1994 | pmid = 7893988 | doi =  | url =  }}</ref> Rintatolimod is a dsRNA, and when TLR-3 senses a dsRNA, it is thought to relay a message to cells to produce [[interferon|interferons (IFNs)]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/15216540600838232 | volume=58 | title=RNase L: Its biological roles and regulation | year=2006 | journal=IUBMB Life (International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology: Life) | pages=508–514 | last1 = Liang | first1 = Shu-Ling}}</ref> IFNs are a group of [[cytokine|signaling molecules]] released by cells in response to the presence of pathogenic viruses or bacteria. These signaling molecules activate (among other things) the protective defenses of the immune system that eradicate pathogens. One such defense mechanism thought to be activated by rintatolimod is the production of the enzyme RNase L. This enzyme degrades pathogenic RNA, both viral and cellular. Degradation of RNA prevents viral and cell replication, and destruction of all RNA within a virus or cell is the last step before apoptosis or death. Accumulation of an inactive form of RNase L may be associated with CFS.<ref name="deMeirleir">{{cite journal |vauthors=Nijs J, De Meirleir K | title = Impairments of the 2-5A synthetase/RNase L pathway in chronic fatigue syndrome | journal = In Vivo | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 1013–21 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16277015 }}</ref>

==History==
Rintatolimod development evolved from a 1960s synthesis by [[Merck & Co.]], a double-stranded [[RNA]] compound of inosinic and cytidylic acid residues (poly I:poly C or poly I:C). Poly I:C inhibited tumor growth by inducing [[interferon]] production, but was too toxic to use. In the mid-1970s, William A. Carter, a post-doctoral researcher at [[Johns Hopkins University]], modified the [[dsRNA]] molecule by adding uridylic acid molecules at specific intervals along the RNA chain. The new compound, called Ampligen (for AMPLIfied GENetic activity) stimulated interferon production like poly I:C, but with much lower toxicity.<ref name="kitei">Kitei, Mindy. [http://www.cfs-news.org/kitei.htm A History of Ampligen: The AIDS Drug No One Can Have]." ''Philadelphia Magazine.'' October 1994. Retrieved on February 25, 2007.</ref> It is also known as "poly I:poly C12U".

Dr. Carter founded a company based upon the compound, and licensed it from Johns Hopkins. By the late 1980s, Carter and his company, HEM Research, Inc., were pursuing human therapeutic uses for rintatolimod, as well as non-therapeutic uses, such as diagnostic testing for [[HIV]] and protecting plants from pathogens.<ref name="hemospherx">"[http://tobaccodocuments.org/pm/2024986987-7026.html?pattern=ampligen%5Ba-z%5D%2A& Business Description: HEM Research, Inc.]" 1986. Retrieved on February 25, 2007.</ref>

Rintatolimod was tested in clinical trials in the United States beginning in 1988, after [[DuPont]] invested $30 million in Hemispherx. Initial success in a small trial for [[AIDS]] treatment was followed by difficulties in persuading the FDA to permit large scale trials. By 1991, it was thought that the chance of approval for a large trial being conducted in the USA had gone. Hemispherx then began to move clinical trials to [[Canada]] and [[Belgium]].<ref name="johnson">{{cite book | last = Johnson | first = H | title = Osler's Web: Inside the Labyrinth of the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Epidemic | year = 1996 | publisher = [[Crown Publishing Group]] | pages = 647–9 | isbn = 051770353X }}</ref>

In Belgium, rintatolimod has been available for use since the drug's trial beginning in May 1996. It has also been available under Canada's Emergency Drug Release Program for both [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] (CFS) and HIV treatment since 1996, with marketing rights controlled by Biovail Corporation International.<ref name="biovail">Melnyk, Eugene; Howling, Kenneth G.

Over its developmental history, rintatolimod has received various designations, including "orphan drug product" and "emergency compassionate cost recovery sales authorization," both from the FDA, and "promising" clinical outcome recognition based on the evaluation of certain summary clinical reports (AHRQ, Agency Health Research Quality).<ref name="sec2">"[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/946644/000114420407013492/v068807_10k.htm Securities and Exchange Commission]</ref>

According to the US National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine, "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a disease characterized by profound fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, sleep abnormalities, autonomic manifestations, pain, and other symptoms that are made worse by exertion of any sort. CFS can severely impair patients’ ability to conduct their normal lives."<ref>[http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2015/ME-CFS.aspx "Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Redefining an Illness" February 10, 2015]</ref> In October 2007, Hemispherx BioPharma submitted their first New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for rintatolimod to treat CFS. In December 2007, the agency deemed the application incomplete, citing deficiencies including lack of dose ranging, statistical analysis plans inconsistent with protocols, database discrepancies, and lack of clinical pharmacology and carcinogenicity data.<ref>http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/NewsEvents/ucm337759.htm ["FDA Drugs: News & Events"]Last Updated 02/05/2013: Retrieved February 21, 2015</ref> In early 2009, Hemispherx again submitted rintatolimod for FDA approval for CFS treatment.

In 2007, and again during the [[2009 swine flu outbreak]], Carter said that rintatolimod could also be used as an [[H1N1]] flu vaccine booster, citing in vitro studies with Ampligen and neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir (brand names Tamiflu and Relenza).<ref>[http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-technology/Hemispherx-Presents-Evidence-of-Ampligen-Synergies-with-Existing-0AAntivirals-at-International-Avian-Influenza-Conference-453-1 "Ampligen Synergies with Existing Avian Flu Antivirals"] (June 4, 2007) Retrieved February 21, 2015</ref>

Hemispherx Biopharma continues to work with the FDA on rintatolimod approval for CFS treatment. On December 20, 2012, an FDA Advisory Committee voted in favor of rintatolimod's safety for commercial use (vote 8 to 5), but not in favor of its efficacy (4 to 9).<ref>[http://www.firstwordpharma.com/node/1265104?tsid=28&region_id=4#axzz3Sc7bwODe "US National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine Reframes Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS)"]</ref> The Complete Response Letter asked for more study data prior to rintatolimod approval.<ref>http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/NewsEvents/ucm337759.htm ["FDA Drugs: News & Events"] Last Updated 02/05/2013: Retrieved February 21, 2015]</ref>
Recently, on January 12, 2015, the company released new in vitro study findings showing that low natural killer cell function associates with greater CFS disease symptom severity, and that rintatolimod treatment increases average NK cell activity over 100%. The new study report, "Low Natural Killer (NK) Activity Observed Across the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) Disease Spectrum," has been submitted as a scientific paper for peer-review and publication. In addition to the new study findings, the paper summarizes 6 supportive publications of results with more than 150 CFS patients, correlating increased debility of CFS and low NK cell activity.<ref name="hemispherx.net">[http://hemispherx.net/content/investor/default.asp?goto=817 "Hemispherx Press Release" (February 23, 2015)]</ref> Clinical testing is currently under way to determine whether NK cell activity augmentation by rintatolimod in vivo associates with lessened CFS disease severity and increased physical endurance and performance measures.<ref name="hemispherx.net"/>

==Controversy==
Twice, in 1998 and 2000, Hemispherx received notices of violation from the FDA for promoting rintatolimod as safe and effective before FDA approval, in violation of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]].<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/EnforcementActivitiesbyFDA/WarningLettersandNoticeofViolationLetterstoPharmaceuticalCompanies/UCM166046.pdf Notice of Violation] - FDA, 7 July 2000,</ref><ref>[http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/EnforcementActivitiesbyFDA/WarningLettersandNoticeofViolationLetterstoPharmaceuticalCompanies/UCM168052.pdf Notice of Violation] - FDA, 15 Oct 1998</ref>

In 1998, Hemispherx Biopharma filed a complaint against Asensio and his company, alleging defamation, conspiracy and interference with its business relations through a short-selling plot.<ref name="google.brand.edgar-online.com"/> After a jury rejected the defamation claims against Asensio, a mistrial was declared.<ref>[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/946644/000114420406045520/v056547_10-q.txt Securities and Exchange Commission]</ref>

The following year, on November 2, 1999, [[Mary Schweitzer]], a chronic fatigue syndrome patient who had been treated with rintatolimod, raised the question of why Ampligen has never been fast-tracked by the US public health authorities at the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Co-ordinating Committee of the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]].<ref>[http://www.cfids-me.org/mystory10.html "My History with ME/CFS:Mary M.

The FDA concluded that the two RCTs "did not provide credible evidence of efficacy."  The agency recommended a minimum of one additional six-month, 300-patient study, and rodent carcinogenicity studies.

Rintatolimod is administered [[intravenously]]. It is generally administered twice weekly for periods of one year or longer. Two toxicology studies had been completed as of 2007, which established the safety of intranasal and intramucosal methods of Ampligen administration as a vaccine immunostimulant.<ref name="sec">, p. 20</ref> Hemispherx has conducted research on a [[Oragen|by mouth versions]] of rintatolimod using nucleic acid technology related to rintatolimod.<ref>[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20030804005302/en/Hemispherx-Biopharma-Receives-Patents-Oral-Dosed-Broad-Spectrum#.VNfKsmjF88g "Hemispherx Biopharma Receives New Patents for Oral Broad-Spectrum Immune Activators (2003)" Retrieved February 8, 2015]</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 15357629 | volume=5 | title=Mismatched double-stranded RNA: polyI:polyC12U | journal=Drugs R D | pages=297–304 | year=2004 | doi=10.2165/00126839-200405050-00006}}</ref>
