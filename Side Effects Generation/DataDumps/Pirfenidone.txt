'''Pirfenidone''' is a medication used for the treatment of [[idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis]] (IPF). It works by reducing lung fibrosis through downregulation of the production of [[growth factors]] and [[procollagen]]s I and II.

It was developed by several companies worldwide, including the original patent holder, Marnac,<ref>http://www.patentdocs.org/2007/11/intermune-buys.html</ref> InterMune Inc. (now part of Roche), Shionogi Ltd., and GNI Group Ltd. In 2008, it was first approved in Japan for the treatment of IPF after clinical trials, under the trade name of Pirespa by [[Shionogi]]. In October 2010, the Indian Company [[Cipla]] launched it as Pirfenex. In 2011, it was approved for use in Europe for IPF under the trade name Esbriet;<ref name=Intermune>{{cite web | url = http://www.gene.com/patients/medicines/esbriet | title = InterMune: Pirfenidone | date = | format = | work = | publisher = InterMune }}</ref> it was approved in Canada in 2012 under the trade name Esbriet; and was approved in the United States in October 2014 under the same name. In September 2011, the Chinese State Food and Drug Administration provided GNI Group Ltd with new drug approval of pirfenidone in China,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.evaluatepharma.com/Universal/View.aspx?type=Story&id=256625 | title = China SFDA Approves F647/pirfenidone for the Treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis | date = 2011-09-22 | work = Press Release | publisher = EvaluatePharma  }}</ref> and later manufacture approval in 2013 under the trade name of Etuary.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://contents.xj-storage.jp/xcontents/AS02433/7727095e/1924/4e98/94dd/7e4b92dc5341/20140213113639388s.pdf | title = GNI Group receives manufacture approval for F647 from China FDA for first idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis drug in China | date = 2014-01-06 | work = Press Release }}</ref>

In 2014 it was approved in Mexico under the name KitosCell LP, indicated for pulmonary fibrosis and liver fibrosis.<ref>kitoscelllp.com</ref> There is also a topical form created for the treatment of abnormal wound healing processes.<ref>Coadjuvant treatment with surgery and pirfenidone in severe facial trauma due to dog bite. The journal of Craniofacial Surgery, volume 24, Number 2, March 2013</ref>

==Medical uses==
In Europe, pirfenidone is indicated for the treatment of mild-to-moderate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. It was approved by the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) in 2011.<ref name=Intermune /> In October 2008, it was approved for use in Japan, in India in 2010, and in China in 2011 (commercial launch in 2014). In October 2014, it was approved for sale in the United States.

In Mexico it has been approved on a gel<ref>http://www.kitoscell.com</ref> form for the treatment of scars and fibrotic tissue<ref>A controlled clinical trial with pirfenidone in the treatment of pathological skin scarring caused by burns in pediatric patients, annals of plastic surgery, volume 68, number 1, january 2012</ref> and has proven to be effective in the treatment of [[skin ulcers]]

==Adverse effects==

===Gastrointestinal===
Pirfenidone is frequently associated with gastrointestinal side effects such as [[dyspepsia]], [[nausea]], gastritis, [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] (GERD) and [[vomiting]].To reduce the severity of these reactions, pirfenidone is to be taken after meals.<ref name=SPC />

===Skin===
Pirfenidone is known to cause [[photosensitivity]] reactions, [[rash]], [[pruritus]] and [[dry skin]]. Patients are usually advised to avoid direct exposure to sunlight, including [[sun lamp]]s, and to use protective clothing and [[sunscreening agents]]. Continuing photosensitivity reactions are usually managed by dose adjustment and temporary discontinuation of treatment if required, along with local symptomatic treatment.<ref name=SPC />

===Hepatic dysfunction===
Pirfenidone can increase hepatic enzyme levels, especially those of [[aspartate transaminase]] (AST), [[alanine transaminase]] (ALT) and [[gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase]] (GGT); periodic monitoring of hepatic enzyme levels is required during therapy: once before the initiation of therapy, monthly monitoring until 6 months after initiation of therapy, and 3 monthly thereafter. Extra precaution is required while prescribing the drug in patients with hepatic impairment and in patients who are concomitantly taking a [[CYP1A2]] [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]]. The drug is contraindicated in patients who have severe hepatic impairment.<ref name=SPC />

===Dizziness and fatigue===
[[Dizziness]] and fatigue have been reported in patients undergoing pirfenidone treatment. Dizziness typically resolves, although patients should know how they react to pirfenidone before undertaking activities that need mental alertness or coordination. If severe, dose adjustment or treatment discontinuation may be required.<ref name=SPC />

===Weight loss===
Weight loss has been reported in patients treated with pirfenidone. Doctors should monitor patients’ weight and encourage increased caloric intake if necessary.<ref name=SPC />

==Interactions==
Most drug interactions are mediated by various [[cytochrome P450]] (CYP) enzymes.<ref name=SPC />

===CYP1A2 inhibitors===
Since Pirfenidone is metabolised through the CYP1A2 enzyme pathway, any drug which inhibits this enzyme is likely to precipitate the toxicity of pirfenidone: concomitant therapy is to be avoided. [[Fluvoxamine]] is contraindicated in patients who are on treatment with pirfenidone. Other inhibitors of CYP1A2 such as [[ciprofloxacin]], [[amiodarone]] and [[propafenone]] should be used with caution.<ref name=SPC />

===Other CYP inhibitors===
Some pirfenidone is also metabolized by CYP enzymes other than CYP1A2. Consequently, strong inhibitors of other CYP systems such as [[fluconazole]] ([[CYP2C9]]), [[chloramphenicol]] ([[CYP2C19]]), [[fluoxetine]] and [[paroxetine]] (both [[CYP2D6]]) should be used with caution.<ref name=SPC />

===CYP1A2 inducers===
Moderate [[Enzyme induction|inducers]] of CYP1A2 such as [[omeprazole]] should be used with caution since they might reduce the circulating plasma levels of the drug.<ref name=SPC />

===Cigarette smoking===
Cigarette smoking causes increased [[Clearance (medicine)|clearance]] of pirfenidone by inducing CYP1A2, thereby decreasing exposure to the drug. Patients must be advised to abstain from cigarette smoking while on therapy with pirfenidone.<ref name=SPC />

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
Pirfenidone has well-established [[antifibrotic]] and [[anti-inflammatory]] properties in various in vitro systems and animal models of [[fibrosis]].<ref name=Schaefer>{{cite journal |vauthors=Schaefer CJ, Ruhrmund DW, Pan L, Seiwert SD, Kossen K | title = Antifibrotic activities of pirfenidone in animal models | journal = Eur Respir Rev | volume = 20 | issue = 120 | pages = 85–97 |date=June 2011 | pmid = 21632796 | doi = 10.1183/09059180.00001111 }}</ref> A number of cell-based studies have shown that pirfenidone reduces [[fibroblast]] proliferation,<ref name=DiSario>{{cite journal |vauthors=Di Sario A, Bendia E, Svegliati Baroni G, Ridolfi F, Casini A, Ceni E, Saccomanno S, Marzioni M, Trozzi L, Sterpetti P, Taffetani S, Benedetti A | title = Effect of pirfenidone on rat hepatic stellate cell proliferation and collagen production | journal = J.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Pirfenidone is administered orally. Though the presence of food significantly reduces the extent of [[absorption (pharmacokinetics)|absorption]], the drug is to be taken after food, to reduce the nausea and dizziness associated with the drug. The drug is around 60% bound to [[plasma proteins]], especially to [[albumin]].<ref name=SPC>{{cite web | url = http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Product_Information/human/002154/WC500103049.pdf | title = Esbriet 267 mg hard capsules | work = Summary of product characteristics | publisher = European Medicines Agency  }}</ref>  Up to 50% of the drug is metabolized by hepatic [[CYP1A2]] enzyme system to yield 5-carboxypirfenidone, the inactive [[metabolite]].

==History==

===Preclinical studies in models of fibrosis===
In animal models, pirfenidone displays a systemic antifibrotic activity and has been shown to reduce [[biochemical]] and [[histopathological]] indices of fibrosis of the lung, liver, heart and kidney.<ref name=Schaefer />

Pirfenidone demonstrates a consistent antifibrotic effect in several animal models of [[pulmonary fibrosis]].<ref name=Kakugawa>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kakugawa T, Mukae H, Hayashi T, Ishii H, Abe K, Fujii T, Oku H, Miyazaki M, Kadota J, Kohno S | title = Pirfenidone attenuates expression of HSP47 in murine bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis | journal = Eur.

The first Phase III clinical trial to evaluate the [[efficacy]] and safety of pirfenidone for the treatment of patients with IPF was conducted in Japan. This was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, trial, in which 275 patients with IPF were randomly assigned to receive pirfenidone 1800&nbsp;mg/day (110 patients), pirfenidone 1200&nbsp;mg/day (56 patients), or [[placebo]] (109 patients), for 52 weeks. Pirfenidone 1800 or 1200&nbsp;mg/day reduced the mean decline in vital capacity from baseline to week 52 compared with placebo. [[Progression-free survival]] was also improved with pirfenidone compared with placebo.<ref name=Taniguchi />

The CAPACITY (004 & 006) studies were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trials in eleven countries across Europe, North America, and Australia.<ref name=Noble /> Patients with IPF were randomly assigned to treatment with oral pirfenidone or placebo for a minimum of 72 weeks.<ref name=Noble /> In study 004, pirfenidone reduced decline in [[forced vital capacity]] (FVC) (p=0.001). Mean change in FVC at week 72 was –8.0% (SD 16.5) in the pirfenidone 2403&nbsp;mg/day group and –12.4% (SD 18.5) in the placebo group, a difference of 4.4% (95% CI 0.7 to 9.1). Thirty-five (20%) of 174 versus 60 (35%) of 174 patients, respectively, had an FVC decline of at least 10%. In study 006, the difference between groups in FVC change at week 72 was not significant (p=0.501). Mean change in FVC at week 72 was –9.0% (SD 19.6) in the pirfenidone group and –9.6% (19.1) in the placebo group. The difference between groups in change in predicted FVC at week 72 was not significant (0.6%, 95% CI –3.5 to 4.7).<ref name=Noble />

In May, 2014, the results of the ASCEND study (Phase III) were published. ASCEND is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 555 patients. The results confirmed observations from previous clinical studies that pirfenidone significantly reduced IPF disease progression as measured by change in percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) from Baseline to Week 52 (rank ANCOVA p<0.000001). In addition, significant treatment effects were shown on both of the key secondary endpoints of six-minute walk test distance change (p=0.0360) and progression-free survival (p=0.0001). A pre-specified analysis of the pooled population (N=1,247) from the combined ASCEND and CAPACITY studies (taking CAPACITY mortality data through Week 52) showed that the risk of all-cause mortality was reduced by 48% in the pirfenidone group compared to the placebo group (HR=0.52, log rank p=0.0107).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intermune.com/pirfenidone |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213173132/http://www.intermune.com/pirfenidone |archivedate=February 13, 2014 }}</ref>

A review by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] concluded that pirfenidone appears to improve progression-free survival and, to a lesser effect, pulmonary function in patients with IPF.<ref name=Spagnolo>{{cite journal |vauthors=Spagnolo P, Del Giovane C, Luppi F, Cerri S, Balduzzi S, Walters EH, D'Amico R, Richeldi L | title = Non-steroid agents for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = | issue = 9 | pages = CD003134 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20824834 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003134.pub2 }}</ref> Randomised studies comparing non-steroid drugs with placebo or steroids in adult patients with IPF were included. Four placebo-controlled trials of pirfenidone treatment were reviewed, involving a total of 1155 patients. The result of the meta-analysis showed that pirfenidone significantly reduces the risk of disease progression by 30%. In addition, meta-analysis of the two Japanese studies confirmed the beneficial effect of pirfenidone on the change in [[Vital capacity|VC]] from baseline compared with placebo.<ref name=Spagnolo />

===Regulatory progress===
In May 2010, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] declined to approve the use of pirfenidone for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, requesting additional clinical trials.<ref name=PHP>{{cite web | url = http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/FDAGeneral/19933 | title = FDA Nixes Pirfenidone for Now, Wants New Trial | author = Frieden J | date = 2010-05-10 | publisher = MedPage Today }}</ref> In December 2010 an advisory panel to the [[European Medicines Agency]] recommended approval of the drug.<ref name=Intermune /> In February 2011, the [[European Commission]] (EC) has granted marketing authorisation in all 27 EU member states and China FDA granted approval in September, 2011. Afterwards, a randomised, Phase III trial (the ASCEND study) was completed in the U.S. in 2014,<ref name=clinicaltrials>{{cite web | url = http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01366209?term=pirfenidone&rank=4 | title = Efficacy and Safety of Pirfenidone in Patients With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) | work = NCT01366209  | publisher = U.S. National Institutes of Health: ClinicalTrials.gov }}</ref> with regulatory approval in U.S. following shortly after.

In Mexico it has been approved in gel for the treatment of chronic wounds and skin injuries and the oral form it is approved for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis and liver fibrosis.
