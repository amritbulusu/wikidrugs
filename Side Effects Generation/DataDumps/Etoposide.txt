==Medical uses==
Etoposide is used as a form of [[chemotherapy]] for cancers such as [[Kaposi’s sarcoma]], [[Ewing's sarcoma]], [[lung cancer]], [[testicular cancer]], [[lymphoma]], nonlymphocytic [[leukemia]], and [[glioblastoma multiforme]]. It is often given in combination with other drugs (such as [[bleomycin]] in treating testicular cancer). It is also sometimes used in a conditioning regimen prior to a [[bone marrow transplant|bone marrow]] or [[stem cell transplant|blood stem cell]] transplant.<ref name="wow" />

===Administration===
It is given [[intravenously]] (IV) or orally in capsule or tablet form. If the drug is given IV, it must be done slowly over a 30- to 60-minute period because it can lower [[blood pressure]] as it is being administered. Blood pressure is checked often during infusing, with the speed of administration adjusted accordingly.

==Side effects==
Common are:
* infusion site reactions
* [[hypotension|low blood pressure]]
* [[alopecia|hair loss]]
* pain and or burning at the IV site
* [[constipation]] or [[diarrhea]]
* [[parageusia|metallic food taste]]
* [[Bone marrow]] suppression, leading to:
** decreased [[white blood cell]] counts (leading to increased susceptibility to [[infection]]s)
** low [[red blood cell]] counts ([[anemia]])
** low [[platelet]] counts (leading to easy bruising and bleeding)

Less common are:
* [[nausea]] and vomiting
* allergic-type reactions
* [[rash]]
* [[fever]], often occurring shortly after IV administration and not due to [[infection]]
* [[mouth ulcer|mouth sores]]
* [[Acute myeloid leukemia]] (which ironically can be treated with etoposide itself)

When given with [[warfarin]], it may cause bleeding.<ref name="gale">{{Cite book| author = Longe JL |title=Gale Encyclopedia Of Cancer: A Guide To Cancer And Its Treatments |publisher=Thomson Gale |location=Detroit |year=2002 |pages=397–399 |isbn=978-1-4144-0362-5}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
Etoposide forms a ternary complex with [[DNA]] and the [[topoisomerase II]] enzyme (which aids in DNA unwinding), prevents [[Ligation (molecular biology)|re-ligation]] of the DNA strands, and by doing so causes DNA strands to break.<ref name="pmid20534341">{{cite journal |vauthors=Pommier Y, Leo E, Zhang H, Marchand C | title = DNA topoisomerases and their poisoning by anticancer and antibacterial drugs | journal = Chem. Biol. | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 421–33 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20534341 | doi = 10.1016/j.chembiol.2010.04.012 }}</ref> [[Cancer]] cells rely on this enzyme more than healthy cells, since they divide more rapidly. Therefore, this causes errors in [[DNA synthesis]] and promotes [[apoptosis]] of the cancer cell.<ref name="wow" /><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gordaliza M, García PA, del Corral JM, Castro MA, Gómez-Zurita MA |title=Podophyllotoxin: distribution, sources, applications and new cytotoxic derivatives |journal=Toxicon |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=441–59 |year=2004 |doi=10.1016/j.toxicon.2004.05.008 |pmid=15302526}}</ref>

==Chemistry==
[[File:Podophyllum peltatum - Köhler–s Medizinal-Pflanzen-246.jpg|thumb|An illustration of the [[wild mandrake]], showing part of the [[rhizome]] (at bottom)]]
Etoposide is a [[semisynthetic]] derivative of [[podophyllotoxin]] from the [[rhizome]] of the [[wild mandrake]] (''Podophyllum peltatum''). More specifically, it is a [[glycoside]] of podophyllotoxin with a <small>D</small>-[[glucose]] derivative. It is chemically similar to the anti-cancer drug [[teniposide]], being distinguished only by a [[methyl]] rest where teniposide has a [[thienyl]].<ref name="Mutschler">{{Cite book|last1=Mutschler|first1=Ernst|last2=Schäfer-Korting|first2=Monika|title=Arzneimittelwirkungen|language=German|location=Stuttgart|publisher=Wissenschaftliche Verlagsgesellschaft|year=2001|edition=8|pages=894–5|isbn=3-8047-1763-2}}</ref> Both these compounds have been developed with the aim of creating less toxic derivatives of podophyllotoxin.<ref name="Dinnendahl">{{cite book|title=Arzneistoff-Profile|editor1=Dinnendahl, V |editor2=Fricke, U |publisher=Govi Pharmazeutischer Verlag|location=Eschborn, Germany|date=2015|edition=28|volume=4|isbn=978-3-7741-9846-3|language=German}}</ref>

The substance is a white to yellow-brown, crystalline powder. It is soluble in organic solvents.<ref name="Dinnendahl" />

It is used in form of its [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] etoposide phosphate.

==History==
Etoposide was first synthesized in 1966 and U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] approval was granted in 1983.<ref name="wow">{{cite journal | author = Hande KR | title = Etoposide: four decades of development of a topoisomerase II inhibitor | journal = Eur.

The nickname VP-16 likely comes from a compounding of the last name of one of the chemists who performed early work on the drug (von Wartburg) and podophyllotoxin.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kuhn M, Von Wartburg A |title=''Podophyllum''-Lignane: Struktur und Absolutkonfiguration von Podorhizol-β-D-glucosid ( = Lignan F). 19.
