== History ==
Daiichi Sankyo was established in 2005 through the merger of {{nihongo|'''Sankyo Company, Limited'''|三共株式会社|Sankyō Kabushiki Kaisha}} and {{nihongo|'''Daiichi Pharmaceutical Company, Limited'''|第一製薬株式会社|Daiichi Seiyaku Kabushiki Kaisha}}, which were century-old [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]] based in [[Japan]]. Sankyo Co., Ltd. was founded by Dr. [[Jokichi Takamine]], who patented the isolation of adrenalin.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bennett|first1=Joan|title=The Time Line: Adrenalin and cherry trees|url=http://pubs.acs.org/subscribe/archive/mdd/v04/i12/html/12timeline.html|website=pubs.acs.org|accessdate=24 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Kawakami|first1=K. K.|title=Jokichi Takamine: A Record of his American Achievements|date=1928|publisher=William Edwin Rudge|location=New York}}</ref> Takamine was also the first president of Sankyo Co., Ltd from March 1913 – July 1922.<ref>{{cite web|title=13th Takamine Memorial Daiichi Sankyo Prize Winner Announced - Media & Investors - Daiichi Sankyo|url=http://www.daiichisankyo.com/media_investors/media_relations/press_releases/detail/006324.html|website=www.daiichisankyo.com|accessdate=24 January 2016}}</ref>

=== Kickbacks ===
Daiichi Sankyo is being "closely monitored" after settling charges concerning payment of remuneration to physicians in the form of speaker fees as part of company's Physician Organization and Discussion program, in violation of the [[False Claims Act]], an anti-[[kickback (bribery)|kickback]] statute.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/daiichi-sankyo-inc-agrees-pay-39-million-settle-kickback-allegations-under-false-claims-act|title=Daiichi Sankyo Inc. Agrees to Pay $39 Million to Settle Kickback Allegations Under the False Claims Act {{!}} OPA {{!}} Department of Justice|website=www.justice.gov|access-date=2016-04-06}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>

Daiichi Sankyo agreed to pay the United States and state [[Medicaid]] programs $39 million to settle allegations by the [[United States Department of Justice]] over kickbacks to doctors.<ref name=":0" /> As part of the company's Physician Organization and Discussion program, Daiichi Sankyo paid physicians improper kickbacks in the form of speaker fees to induce physicians to prescribe Daiichi drugs, including Azor, Benicar, Tribenzor and Welchol.<ref name=":0" /> Allegedly, payments were made to physicians even when physician participants in PODs took turns “speaking” on duplicative topics over Daiichi-paid dinners, the recipient spoke only to members of his or her own staff in his or her own office, or the associated dinner was so lavish that its cost exceeded Daiichi’s own internal cost limitation of $140 per person.<ref name=":0" />

“Schemes such as this are particularly abhorrent,” said Inspector General [[Daniel R. Levinson]] for the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]].<ref name=":0" /> “Manufacturers and physicians who engage in them are cheating Medicare and Medicaid out of millions of dollars and threatening programs upon which many elderly and disabled Americans rely. My office will take whatever steps necessary to guard against improper alliances between manufacturers of drugs and those who prescribe them. Through our corporate integrity agreement we will be closely monitoring Daiichi.”<ref name=":0" />
