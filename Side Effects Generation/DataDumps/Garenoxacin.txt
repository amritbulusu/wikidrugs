'''Garenoxacin''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) is a [[Quinolone antibiotic|quinolone]] [[antibiotic]] for the treatment of [[Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative]] bacterial infections.

Garenoxacin was discovered by Toyama Chemical Co., Ltd. of Tokyo, Japan, and is currently being marketed in [[Japan]] under the tradename Geninax. [[Schering-Plough]] holds worldwide rights for garenoxacin, except for Japan, [[South Korea]], and [[China]].

On February 13, 2006, [[Schering-Plough]] announced that the [[United States]] [[Food and Drug Administration]] had accepted the New Drug Application (NDA) for garenoxacin, and had been granted a 10-month review.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drugs.com/nda/garenoxacin_060213.html |title=Drugs.com, Schering-Plough Reports Garenoxacin NDA Accepted for FDA Review |accessdate=2008-03-25 |work= }}</ref> As of 2015, however, it has not been approved in the USA.

Schering-Plough later withdrew its application to the United States Food and Drug Administration, FDA, (August 20, 2006) for approval of the antibiotic Garenoxacin.<ref>http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/schering-plough-pulls-its-garenoxacin-app/2006-08-21</ref>

The [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMEA) had also been formally notified by Schering-Plough Europe (July 28, 2007) of its decision to withdraw the application for a centralized marketing authorization for garenoxacin as well.<ref>http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/78052.php</ref><ref>http://www.emea.europa.eu/humandocs/PDFs/EPAR/garenoxacinmesylate/34117407en.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.emea.europa.eu/humandocs/PDFs/EPAR/garenoxacinmesylate/H-747-WAR.pdf</ref>  Based on the CHMP review of the data regarding safety and efficacy (risk/benefit), the CHMP considered the application for garenoxacin to be unapprovable.<ref>http://www.emea.europa.eu/humandocs/PDFs/EPAR/garenoxacinmesylate/H-747-WAR.pdf</ref>
