'''Becaplermin''' (brand name '''Regranex''') is a [[cicatrizant]], available as a topical gel. Regranex is a human [[platelet-derived growth factor]] indicated along with good wound care for the treatment of lower extremity diabetic neuropathic ulcers. <ref> http://www.regranex.com/patient/pdf/PI_full_version.pdf.</ref> It is also known as "platelet-derived growth factor BB".<ref>{{MeshName|becaplermin}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
The drug is used for the treatment of [[diabetic]] [[foot ulcer]]s.<ref name="pmid11849120">{{cite journal |author=Nagai MK, Embil JM |title=Becaplermin: recombinant platelet derived growth factor, a new treatment for healing diabetic foot ulcers |journal=Expert Opin Biol Ther |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=211â€“8 |date=February 2002|pmid=11849120 |doi=10.1517/14712598.2.2.211 |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1517/14712598.2.2.211}}</ref> Studies of becaplermin showed that when used with good wound care, complete healing significantly increased and the ulcers healed on average 6 weeks faster.<ref>Wieman TJ, Smiell JM, Su Y.

The amount of becaplermin to be applied will vary depending upon the size of the ulcer area. Becaplermin should be stored in the refrigerator. <ref>http://www.regranex.com/patient/pdf/PI_full_version.pdf</ref>
Analysis of healing human wounds showed that PDGF-BB induces fibroblast proliferation and differentiation and was found to increase healing in patients with decreased healing capacity, such as people living with diabetes. <ref>Heldin CH, Westermark B. Mechanism of action and in vivo role of platelet-derived growth factor. Physiol Rev. 1999;79:1283-1316.</ref>

==Contraindications==
Becaplermin must not be used at the site of a [[skin cancer]].<ref name="Drugs.com">{{Drugs.com|pro|regranex}} for Regranex.</ref>

==Adverse effects==
The most common side effects in clinical studies were [[erythematous rash]]es.<ref name="Drugs.com" />

A [[boxed warning]] has been added to the safety label to describe an increase rate of death from [[cancer]] when three or more tubes are used.<ref>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/575748?sssdmh=dm1.359512&scr=ddd Medscape Article]</ref>
Regranex should be used with caution in patients with known malignancy.<ref>http://www.regranex.com/patient/pdf/PI_full_version.pdf</ref>
