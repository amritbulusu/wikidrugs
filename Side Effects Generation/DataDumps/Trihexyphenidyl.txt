'''Trihexyphenidyl''' ('''Artane''', '''Apo-Trihex''', '''Parkin''', '''Pacitane'''), also known as '''benzhexol''', '''Ariane''', and '''trihex''', is an [[antiparkinsonian]] agent of the [[antimuscarinic]] class.  It has been in clinical usage for decades.{{vague|date=June 2017}}

== Uses ==
Trihexyphenidyl is used for the symptomatic treatment of [[Parkinson's disease]] in mono and combination therapy. It is active in [[Postencephalitic parkinsonism|postencephalitic]], [[arteriosclerotic]], and [[idiopathic]] forms. The drug is also commonly used to treat [[Extrapyramidal symptoms|extrapyramidal]] side effects occurring during [[antipsychotic]] treatment. It reduces the frequency and duration of [[oculogyric crisis|oculogyric crises]] as well as of [[Dyskinesia|dyskinetic]] movements and spastic contractions.  Trihexyphenidyl may improve [[psychotic depression]] and [[mental inertia]] frequently associated with Parkinson's disease and symptomatic problems caused by antipsychotic treatment.{{mcn|date=May 2017}}

The drug cannot cure Parkinson's disease, but may provide substantial alleviation of symptoms. An estimated 50 to 75% of people with Parkinson's disease will react positively and experience a 20 to 30% symptomatic improvement. To increase therapeutic activity trihexyphenidyl is often given concomitantly with [[levodopa]], other antimuscarinic or antihistaminic (e.g. [[diphenhydramine]]) agents. Combination treatment with dopaminergic agonists such as [[cabergoline]] is also possible. This is often termed a 'multidimensional approach'. It has also been prescribed for [[essential tremor]] and [[akathisia]].{{mcn|date=May 2017}}

== Contraindications ==
Contradindications include:{{mcn|date=May 2017}}
* Hypersensitivity to trihexyphenidyl
* Narrow angle [[glaucoma]]
* [[Ileus]]
* Caution : People with obstructive diseases of the urogenital tract, people with a known history of seizures and those with potentially dangerous [[tachycardia]]
* People under 18 yrs. of age should not be treated due to a lack of clinical experience.
* People should allow a period to adjust to the dose when first starting trihexyphenidyl and when the dose has been increased or added to a regimen with other drugs because acute somnolence and accumulated fatigue can make it particularly dangerous to operate an automobile, heavy machinery etc.

== Adverse effects ==
Dose-dependent [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]]s are frequent, but typically lessen over time as the body adapts to the medication. All of the following symptoms considered, Artane has been shown to dramatically and consistently improve neurologic defects in people aged 16-86 over the course of five years.<ref> Doshay, L. J., K. Constable, and A. Zier. "Five year follow-up of treatment with trihexyphenidyl (Artane): Outcome in four hundred eleven cases of paralysis agitans." Journal of the American Medical Association 154.16 (1954): 1334-1336. </ref> People who are older or who psychiatric conditions  may become confused or develop [[delirium]]. Side effects include but are not limited to:<ref>{{cite web|title=Trihexyphenidyl|url=http://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-8720/trihexyphenidyl-oral/details#side-effects|website=Web MD|publisher=First Databank Inc}}</ref>

* Central nervous system: [[drowsiness]], [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], [[headache]], and [[dizziness]] are frequent. With high doses nervousness, agitation, [[anxiety]], delirium, and confusion are noted. Trihexyphenidyl may be abused due to a short acting mood-elevating and euphoric effect. The normal sleep architecture may be altered ([[REM sleep]] depression). Trihexyphenidyl may lower the seizure-threshold.
* Peripheral side effects: dry mouth, impaired sweating, abdominal discomfort, [[nausea]], and [[constipation]] are frequent. [[Tachycardia]] or heart palpitations (fast heart rate) may be noted. Allergic reactions are rare, but may occur. Many of these peripheral symptoms, especially considering an acute increase in anxiety with various physical complaints, as well as evidence of orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia are indicative of [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]], especially in people with psychiatric conditions <ref> TRIHEXYPHENIDYL
http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/r?dbs+hsdb:@term+@rn+@rel+144-11-6 </ref>
* Eyes: trihexyphenidyl causes [[mydriasis]] with or without [[photophobia]]. It may precipitate narrow angle glaucoma or cause blurred vision.
* Tolerance may develop during therapy which requires dose adjustments.
* Striated musculature and weight gain.

Trihexyphenidyl is a [[pregnancy category]] C drug. It is advised to only use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.<ref>{{cite web|title=trihexyphenidyl (Rx)|url=http://reference.medscape.com/drug/trihexyphenidyl-343054#6|website=Medscape}}</ref>

== Overdose ==
{{medref|section|date=May 2017}}
Trihexyphenidyl (THP) and other antiparkinsonian drugs are known to be substances of abuse. This is true both in abusers of other substances and in chronic schizophrenics, the latter being infrequent abusers of other drugs. Trihexyphenidyl mimics an atropine intoxication with mydriasis, dryness of mucous membranes, red face, atonic states of bowels and bladder, and [[hyperthermia]] in high doses. Central consequences are agitation, confusion, and hallucinations. An untreated overdose may be fatal, particularly in children. Premortal signs are respiratory depression and cardiac arrest. A specific antagonist is [[physostigmine]] which combines a peripheral and a central action. [[Carbachol]] can be used to treat atonic bowel and bladder. The vital functions should be monitored and stabilized. It may be necessary to treat hyperthermia with cooling blankets. Clinical case reports have repeatedly shown overdose of Trihexyphenidyl alongside other substances.

== Interactions ==
{{medref|section|date=May 2017}}
* Other anticholinergic drugs (e.g. spasmolytics, [[antihistamine]]s, TCAs) : Side effects of trihexyphenidyl may be increased.
* [[Quinidine]] : Increased anticholinergic action (particular on AV conduction).
* Antipsychotics : Long term use of trihexyphenidyl  may mask or increase the risk of [[tardive dyskinesia]].
* [[Pethidine]] (meperidine) : Central effects and side effects of pethidine may be increased.
* [[Metoclopramide]] : Action of metoclopramide is decreased.
* Alcohol : Risk of serious intoxication.

== Pharmacology ==
The exact mechanism of action in parkinsonian syndromes is not precisely understood, but it is known that trihexyphenidyl blocks efferent impulses in parasympathetically innervated structures like smooth muscles (spasmolytic activity), salivary glands, and eyes ([[mydriasis]]). In higher doses direct central inhibition of cerebral motor centers may contribute. In very high doses central toxicity as seen in [[atropine]] overdose is noted. It binds to the [[M1 muscarinic receptor]]<ref>{{Cite journal

==Chemistry==
Trihexyphenidyl can be synthesized in two ways, one linear and one convergent synthesis.

In the first way, the initial 2-(1-piperidino)propiophenone is synthesized in turn by the aminomethylation of [[acetophenone]] using [[paraformaldehyde]] and [[piperidine]] in a [[Mannich reaction]]. In the second step the 2-(1-piperidino)propiophenone is reacted with cyclohexylmagnesium bromide in a [[Grignard reaction]].<ref>Weiss, Martin J., and Maurice D. O'Donoghue.

== History ==
Artane, or its generic form Trihexyphenidyl HCL, was approved by the FDA on June 25th, 2003 for the clinical use of all types of parkinsonism.<ref>{{citeweb|last1=Katz|first1=Russell|last2=Feeney|first2=John|last3=Ressler|first3=Timothy|last4=David|first4=Paul|title=Approval Package for Application No. 6-773/36|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2003/006773_S036_ARTANE.pdf|website=Access Data from the Food and Drug Association|publisher=FDA|accessdate=8 May 2017}}</ref>However, it has been clinically relevant in trials pertaining to Parkinson's disease since 1949.<ref> Doshay, L. J., and Constable, K.: Artane Therapy for Parkinsonism, J.A.M.A. 140:1317 (Aug. 27) 1949</ref> Artane is an anticholinergic drug which is prescribed by doctors throughout the world. It is also abused, typically in combination with other drugs or delicate pharmaceutical agents. Prisons in Iraq were among the places where abuse was obvious, along with within communities of Iraqi soldiers.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

==Society and culture==
=== Recreational use ===
In a 2008 news report, trihexyphenidyl was seen to be used for recreational purposes among Iraqi soldiers and police, among other prescription drugs. The report states that the drugs were taken to relieve combat stress.<ref>{{citation |author=Mudhafer Al-Husaini; Erica Goode |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/21/world/middleeast/21drugs.html?pagewanted=all |title=Abuse of Prescription Drugs Rises Among Stressed Iraqi Soldiers |publisher=New York Times |date=2008-12-20}}</ref> Although that may be the case for some, others used Artane as a substitute or more intense version of LSD. This was especially prevalent in the 1960's, according to a report in "The New Yorker". Similarly to those in Iraqi forces, some of the appeal was that the individual may retain partial control while under the influence.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sacks|first1=Oliver|title=Altered States|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/08/27/altered-states-3|website=The New Yorker|publisher=Condé Nast|accessdate=7 May 2017}}</ref>

The neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]] reports using the drug recreationally in the 1960s.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2012/oct/30/oliver-sacks-shares-hallucinations |title=Oliver Sacks shares his hallucinations |publisher=Guardian |date=2012-10-30}}</ref> He recalled taking "a large dose" knowing full well the drug was intended for people with Parkinson's. More recounts of Dr. Sack's experiences - including experimentation with [[mescaline]], [[psilocybin]], [[LSD]], and probably [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] <ref>{{cite book|last1=Sacks|first1=Oliver|title=Hallucinations|date=2012|publisher=Random House Inc.|location=Ch. 6}}</ref> - have been compared in his novel [[Hallucinations (book)]].
