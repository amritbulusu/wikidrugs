'''Benzydamine''' (also known as Tantum Verde and branded in some countries as Difflam), available as the hydrochloride salt, is a locally-acting [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] (NSAID) with local [[anaesthetic]] and [[analgesic]] properties for pain relief and anti-inflammatory treatment of inflammatory conditions of the [[mouth]] and [[throat]].<ref>{{Cite journal

==Medical use==
* [[odontology|Odonto]][[stomatology]]: [[gingivitis]], [[stomatitis]], [[glossitis]], [[aphthous ulcers]], [[dental surgery]] and oral [[Mouth ulcer|ulceration]] due to [[radiation therapy]].
* Otorhinolaryngology: [[glandular fever]], [[pharyngitis]], [[tonsillitis]], post-[[tonsillectomy]], [[radiation]] or [[intubation]] [[mucositis]].
It may be used alone or as an adjunct to other therapy giving the possibility of increased [[therapeutic effect]] with little risk of interaction.

In some markets, the drug is supplied as an over-the-counter cream (Lonol in Mexico from [[Boehringer Ingelheim]]) used for topical treatment of musculoskeletal system disorders: sprains, strains, bursitis, tendinitis, synovitis, myalgia, periarthritis.

==Antimicrobial activity==
Studies indicate that benzydamine has notable [[in vitro]] [[antibacterial]] activity and also shows synergism in combination with other antibiotics, especially tetracyclines, against antibiotic-resistant strains of [[Staphylococcus aureus]] and [[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]].<ref>Fanaki NH, el-Nakeeb MA. Antimicrobial activity of benzydamine, a non-steroid anti-inflammatory agent. ''J Chemother.'' 1992 Dec;4(6):347-52. {{PMID|1287137}}</ref><ref>Fanaki NH, el-Nakeeb MA. Antibacterial activity of benzydamine and antibiotic-benzydamine combinations against multifold resistant clinical isolates. ''Arzneimittelforschung.'' 1996 Mar;46(3):320-3. {{PMID|8901158}}</ref>

==Contraindications==
There are no contraindications to the use of benzydamine except for known [[hypersensitivity]].

==Side effects==
Benzydamine is well tolerated. Occasionally oral tissue numbness or stinging sensations may occur, as well as itching, a skin rash, skin swelling or redness, difficulty breathing and wheezing.

==Pharmacology==
It selectively binds to inflamed tissues ([[Prostaglandin#Biosynthesis|Prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor]]) and is normally free of adverse systemic effects.
Unlike other NSAIDs, it does not inhibit cyclooxygenase or lipooxygenase, and is not ulcerogenic.<ref name=clintox/>

==Recreational use==
Benzydamine has been used recreationally. In overdosages it acts a [[deliriant]] and [[CNS stimulant]].<ref name=clintox>{{Cite journal

==Synthesis==

Synthesis starts with the reaction of the ''N''-benzyl derivative from [[methyl anthranilate]] with [[nitrous acid]] to give the ''N''-nitroso derivative. Reduction by means of [[sodium thiosulfate]] leads to the transient hydrazine ('''3'''), which undergoes spontaneous internal hydrazide formation. Treatment of the enolate of this amide with 3-chloro-1-dimethylamkino propane gives benzydamine ('''5'''). Please note there is an error in this section: US3318905 states that the nitroso derivative is reduced with sodium hydrosulfite (sodium dithionite) and not with sodium hyposulfite (sodium thiosulfate), as shown in the above scheme and stated in text. 
[[File:Benzydamine synthesis 2.svg|thumb|center|500px|<ref name=Palazzo/><ref>L. Baiocchi, G. Corsi and G. Palazzo, Ann.Chim. (Roma), 55, 116 (1965).</ref>]]
An interesting alternative synthesis of this substance starts by sequential reaction of ''N''-benzylaniline with [[phosgene]], and then with [[sodium azide]] to product the corresponding carbonyl azide. On heating, nitrogen is evolved and a separatable mixture of [[nitrene]] insertion product and the desired ketoindazole # results. The latter reaction appears to be a [[Curtius rearrangement]] type product to produce an N-isocyanate #, which then cyclizes. Alkylation of the enol with sodium methoxide and 3-dimethylaminopropyl chloride gives benzydamine.

Alternatively, use of [[chloroacetamide]] in the alkylation step followed by acid hydrolysis produces [[bendazac]] instead.
