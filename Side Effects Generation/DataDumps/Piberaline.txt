'''Piberaline''' ('''EGYT-475'''; '''Trelibet''') is a [[psychoactive drug]] and member of the [[piperazine]] [[chemical class]] which was [[drug development|developed]] in the 1980s. It has [[stimulant]] and [[antidepressant]] effects which are thought to be due largely to its active metabolite [[benzylpiperazine]].<ref>Tekes K, Tothfalusi L, Malomvolgyi B, Herman F, Magyar K. Studies on the biochemical mode of action of EGYT-475, a new antidepressant. Polish Journal of Pharmacology and Pharmacy. 1987 Mar-Apr;39(2):203-11.</ref> It was researched to a limited extent in Hungary and Spain, but was not widely accepted and does not seem to be in current use, although a closely related drug [[befuraline]] with similar effects has been slightly more successful.
