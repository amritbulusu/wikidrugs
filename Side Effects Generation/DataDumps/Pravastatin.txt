'''Pravastatin''' (marketed as '''Pravachol''' or '''Selektine''') is a member of the drug class of [[statin]]s, used in combination with diet, exercise, and weight loss for lowering [[cholesterol]] and preventing [[cardiovascular disease]].

==Medical uses==
Pravastatin is primarily used for the treatment of [[dyslipidemia]] and the prevention of [[cardiovascular disease]].<ref name=AHFS>{{cite web|title=Pravachol|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/pravachol.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref> It is recommended to be used only after other measures, such as diet, exercise, and weight reduction, have not improved cholesterol levels.<ref name=AHFS />

The evidence for the use of pravastatin is generally weaker than for other statins. The antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatment to prevent heart attack trial (ALLHAT), failed to demonstrate a difference in all-cause mortality or nonfatal [[myocardial infarction]]/fatal [[coronary heart disease]] rates between patients receiving pravastatin 40&nbsp;mg daily (a common starting dose) and those receiving usual care.<ref>{{cite journal|last=No Authors Listed|title=Major outcomes in moderately hypercholesterolemic, hypertensive patients randomized to pravastatin vs usual care: The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT-LLT)|journal=JAMA|year=2002|volume=288|issue=23|pages=2998–3007|doi=10.1001/jama.288.23.2998|pmid=12479764}}</ref>

==Adverse effects and contraindications==
Pravastatin has undergone over 112,000 patient-years of double-blind, randomized trials using the 40-mg, once-daily dose and placebos. These trials indicate pravastatin is well tolerated and displays few noncardiovascular abnormalities in patients.<ref>Pfeffer MA, Keech A, Sacks FM, et al. "Safety and tolerability of pravastatin in long-term clinical trials: prospective Pravastatin Pooling (PPP) Project." ''Circulation'' 2002;105:2341-2346</ref>  However, side effects may occur. A doctor should be consulted if symptoms such as heartburn or headache are severe and do not go away.

These uncommon side effects should be promptly reported to the prescribing doctor or an emergency medical service:<ref name=AHFS />
* muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness
* lack of energy
* fever
* [[jaundice]], yellowing of the skin or eyes
* pain in the upper right part of the stomach
* nausea
* extreme tiredness
* unusual bleeding or bruising
* dark-colored urine
* loss of appetite
* flu-like symptoms
* rash
* hives
* itching
* difficulty breathing or swallowing
* swelling of the face, throat, tongue, lips, eyes, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs
* hoarseness

These symptoms should be reported to the prescribing doctor if they persist or increase in severity:
* heartburn
* headache
* memory loss or forgetfulness
* confusion

[[Contraindication]]s, conditions that warrant withholding treatment with pravastatin, include pregnancy and breastfeeding.<ref name=RxList>{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Eni|title=Pravachol Side Effects Center|url=http://www.rxlist.com/pravachol-side-effects-drug-center.htm|publisher=RxList|accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref> Taking pravastatin while pregnant could lead to birth defects. While the amount of pravastatin ingested by an infant from breastfeeding is low, patients breastfeeding should not take pravastatin due to potential effects on the infant's lipid metabolism.<ref name=LactMed>{{cite web|title=Pravastatin|url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/f?./temp/~MNhuQa:1|work=LactMed|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine|accessdate=1 December 2012}}</ref>

==Drug interactions==
Medications that should not be taken with pravastatin include, but are not limited to:<ref name="AHFS"/><ref name=RxList/>
* [[Cimetidine]] (Tagamet) 
* [[Colchicine]] (Colcrys)
* [[Cyclosporine]] (Neoral, Sandimmune)
* [[Ketoconazole]] (Nizoral)
* Additional cholesterol-lowering medications such as: [[fenofibrate]] (Tricor), [[gemfibrozil]] (Lopid), [[cholestyramine]] (Questran, Questran Light, Cholybar), and [[niacin]] (nicotinic acid, Niacor, Niaspan);
* Specific [[HIV protease inhibitor]]s such as: [[lopinavir]] and ritonavir (Kaletra), and [[ritonavir]] (Norvir) taken with [[darunavir]] (Prezista); and [[spironolactone]] (Aldactone).

Pravastatin is cleared by the kidney, giving it a distinct advantage over other statins when a potential for drug interactions using the hepatic pathway exists.

==Mechanism of action==
Pravastatin acts as a lipoprotein-lowering drug through two pathways. In the major pathway, pravastatin inhibits the function of [[HMG-CoA reductase|hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase]]. As a [[reversible inhibitor|reversible]] [[competitive inhibition|competitive]] inhibitor, pravastatin [[steric hindrance|sterically hinders]] the action of HMG-CoA reductase by occupying the active site of the enzyme. Taking place primarily in the liver, this enzyme is responsible for the conversion of [[HMG-CoA]] to [[mevalonic acid|mevalonate]] in the rate-limiting step of the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol. Pravastatin also inhibits the synthesis of very-low-density lipoproteins, which are the precursor to low-density lipoproteins (LDL). These reductions increase the number of cellular LDL receptors, thus LDL uptake increases, removing it from the bloodstream.<ref>Vaughan, C. J., and A. M. Gotto, Jr. 2004. Update on statins: 2003. ''Circulation'' 110: 886–892.</ref> Overall, the result is a reduction in circulating cholesterol and LDL. A minor reduction in triglycerides and an increase in high-density lipoproteins (HDL) are common.

==History==
Initially known as CS-514, pravastatin is a derivative of ML236B (compactin), which was identified in a fungus called ''[[Penicillium citrinum]]'' in the 1970s by researchers of the [[Daiichi Sankyo Co.|Sankyo Pharma Inc.]]<ref name=Tolbert>Jonathan A. Tobert  [http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v2/n7/full/nrd1112.html Lovastatin and beyond: the history of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors] Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 2, 517-526 (July 2003) {{PMID|12815379}}</ref>  It is being marketed outside [[Japan]] by the [[pharmaceutical company]] [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]]. In 2005, Pravachol was the 22nd-highest selling brand-name drug in the United States, with sales totaling $1.3 billion.<ref name="fda announcement">{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2006/ucm108644.htm |title=FDA Approves First Generic Pravastatin |accessdate=2008-01-20 |work=}}</ref>

The [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] approved generic pravastatin for sale in the [[United States]] for the first time on April 24, 2006. Generic pravastatin sodium tablets are manufactured by [[Biocon]] Ltd, [[India]] and TEVA Pharmaceuticals in Kfar Sava, [[Israel]].<ref name="fda announcement" />
