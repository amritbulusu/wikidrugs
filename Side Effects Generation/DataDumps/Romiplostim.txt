'''Romiplostim''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|rINN]], [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]) is a [[fusion protein]] analog of [[thrombopoietin]], a [[hormone]] that regulates [[platelet]] production.

==Indications and Marketing==
The drug was developed by [[Amgen]] and is marketed under the trade name '''Nplate''' through a restricted usage program called NEXUS.<ref name=Medscape/>  During development and [[clinical trial]]s the drug was called AMG531.

Romiplostim is indicated as a potential treatment for [[immune thrombocytopenic purpura|chronic idiopathic (immune) thrombocytopenic purpura]] (ITP).<ref name="pmid18242413">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Kuter DJ, Bussel JB, Lyons RM, etal |title=Efficacy of romiplostim in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura: a double-blind randomised controlled trial |journal=Lancet |volume=371 |issue=9610 |pages=395–403 |date=February 2008 |pmid=18242413 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60203-2 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(08)60203-2}}</ref>   Romiplostim was designated an [[orphan drug]] by the [[United States Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 2003, as the chronic ITP population in the USA is under 200,000 (the chronic adult ITP population in the USA is thought to be around 60,000, with women outnumbering men by a factor of two).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.drugs.com/nda/romiplostim_080312.html | title=Amgen to Discuss Romiplostim BLA | date=March 12, 2008 | accessdate=2008-11-04 | publisher=drugs.com}}</ref> The wholesale cost of romiplostim if administered weekly is currently estimated at US $55,250 per year.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 19386944 | doi=10.2146/ajhp080524 | volume=66 | title=Romiplostim: a novel thrombopoiesis-stimulating agent | journal=Am J Health Syst Pharm | pages=817–24 | last1 = Perreault | first1 = S | last2 = Burzynski | first2 = J}}</ref>

On August 22, 2008, the FDA approved romiplostim as a long-term treatment for chronic ITP in adults who have not responded to other treatments, such as [[corticosteroid]]s, [[intravenous immunoglobulin]], [[Rho(D) immune globulin]] or [[splenectomy]].<ref name=Medscape>{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/580032 |title=FDA Approvals: Nplate, Aloxi, Vidaza |author=Waknine, Yael |date=September 4, 2008 |accessdate=2008-09-04 |publisher=[[Medscape]]}} Freely available with registration.</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.amgen.com/media/pr.jsp?year=2008 |title=FDA Approves Nplate(TM) for Long-Term Treatment of Adult Chronic ITP |date=August 22, 2008 |accessdate=2008-09-04 |publisher=Amgen}}</ref>

==Treatment regimen==
Romiplostim treatment is generally administered at weekly intervals via [[subcutaneous injection]].  Prior to injection, a [[complete blood count]] (CBC) is obtained, as the dosage is dependent on the individual's body weight and [[platelet count]] at the time of treatment.  The goal of treatment is to maintain the count above 50,000 per cubic millimeter (mm<sup>3</sup>) of blood, not to achieve a normal count&mdash;defined as 150,000&ndash;450,000 per mm<sup>3</sup> in most healthy individuals.  If a count of 200,000 or higher is achieved for two consecutive weeks a reduced dose is administered or treatment is suspended until the count decreases below 200,000.  Discontinuation of romiplostim must be approached with great caution, as a rapid decrease in the platelet count may occur, possibly leading to [[bleeding diathesis]].

==Clinical efficacy==
In well designed, 24-week, Phase III trials, romiplostim was significantly more effective than placebo in achieving the primary endpoint of a protocol-defined durable platelet response in nonsplenectomized or splenectomized adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Frampton J. E., Lyseng-Williamson K. A.|title=Romiplostim|language=en|journal=Drugs |date=2009|pages=307–317|pmid=19275274|doi=10.2165/00003495-200969030-00006|volume=69|issue=3}}</ref>

==Side-effects==
Romiplostim's effect is to stimulate the patient's [[megakaryocyte]]s to produce platelets at a more rapid than normal rate, thus overwhelming the [[immune system]]'s ability to destroy them. As doing so involves changes to the [[bone marrow]] chemistry, a number of potentially serious [[adverse drug reaction|side-effects]] may develop, including death, [[myalgia]], joint and extremity discomfort, [[insomnia]], [[thrombocytosis]], which may lead to potentially fatal [[clot]]s, and [[myelofibrosis|bone marrow fibrosis]], the latter which may result in an [[anemia|unsafe decrease]] in the [[red blood count]].
