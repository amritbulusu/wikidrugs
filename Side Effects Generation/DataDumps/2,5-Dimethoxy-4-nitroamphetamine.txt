'''2,5-Dimethoxy-4-nitroamphetamine''' ('''DON''') is a [[recreational drug]] and [[amphetamine]].  It is a [[structural analog|analog]] of [[2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine|DOM]] and [[2,5-Dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine|DOB]].  It is also closely related to [[2C-N]].

==Chemistry==
DON is in a class of compounds commonly known as alpha-[[methyl]] [[phenethylamine]]s, or [[amphetamine]]s and the full chemical name is 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-nitrophenyl)propan-2-amine.  It has a [[stereocenter]]. 

==Effects==
In his book ''[[PiHKAL|PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known And Loved)]]'', [[Alexander Shulgin]] lists a dosage of DON as being 3-4.5 [[milligram|mg]] orally with amphetamine-like stimulation lasting 8–15 hours.<ref name= pihkal >[http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal070.shtml DON Entry in PiHKAL]</ref>

==Dangers==
The toxicity of DON is not known.

==Legality==
DON is unscheduled in the [[United States]], but because of its close similarity in structure and effects to [[2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine|DOM]] and [[2,5-Dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine|DOB]], possession and sale of DON may be subject to prosecution under the [[Federal Analog Act]].{{cn|date=February 2013}} DON is listed as a Class A drug in the [[Drugs controlled by the UK Misuse of Drugs Act]] after the table of contents of Pihkal and Tihkal were added to the schedules.
