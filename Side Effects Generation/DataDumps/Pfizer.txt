== History ==
Pfizer was founded in 1849 by cousins [[Charles Pfizer]] and [[Charles F. Erhart]] in New York City as a manufacturer of [[fine chemical]]s. Its discovery of Terramycin ([[oxytetracycline]]) in 1950 put it on a path towards becoming a research-based pharmaceutical company. It has made numerous acquisitions, including [[Warner–Lambert]] in 2000, [[Pharmacia]] in 2003, and [[Wyeth]] in 2009 (the largest of the three at $68&nbsp;billion).<ref name="NYT_2009">{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/26/business/26drug.html | title=Pfizer Agrees to Pay $68 billion for Rival Drug Maker Wyeth |work=The New York Times |date=January 26, 2009 |author1=Andrew Ross Sorkin  |author2=Duff Wilson  |lastauthoramp=yes }}</ref><ref name=PfizerWyeth>{{cite web|url=http://www.pfizer.com/investors/shareholder_services/wyeth_transaction.jsp |title=Wyeth Transaction |publisher=Pfizer |accessdate=October 25, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019062550/http://www.pfizer.com/investors/shareholder_services/wyeth_transaction.jsp |archivedate=October 19, 2009 }}</ref>

=== 19th century ===
[[File:Charlespfizer.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Charles Pfizer]]
Pfizer is named after [[German-American]] [[Charles Pfizer]] who co-founded the company with his cousin [[Charles F. Erhart]]. Originally from [[Ludwigsburg]], Germany, they launched a chemicals business, '''Charles Pfizer and Company''', from a building at the intersection of Harrison Avenue and Bartlett Street<ref name="Citycyclopedia">Kenneth T. Jackson. ''The Encyclopedia of New York City''. The New York Historical Society; Yale University Press; September 1995. P. 895. {{ISBN|978-0-300-05536-8}}</ref> in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]], in 1849. There, they produced an [[antiparasitic]] called [[santonin]]. This was an immediate success, although it was the production of [[citric acid]] that really kick-started Pfizer's growth in the 1880s. Pfizer continued to buy property to expand its lab and factory on the block bounded by Bartlett Street; Harrison Avenue; Gerry Street; and [[Flushing Avenue]]. Pfizer's original administrative headquarters was at 81 Maiden Lane in Manhattan.<ref name="Citycyclopedia"/>

===20th century===
By 1906, sales totaled $3.4 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=Charles Pfizer|url=http://www.pfizer.com/about/history/charles_pfizer|publisher=Pfizer|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>

World War I caused a shortage of [[calcium citrate]] that Pfizer imported from [[Italy]] for the manufacture of citric acid, and the company began a search for an alternative supply. Pfizer chemists learned of a fungus that ferments sugar to citric acid and were able to commercialize production of citric acid from this source in 1919. As a result, Pfizer developed expertise in [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] technology. These skills were applied to the mass production of the [[antibiotic]] [[penicillin]] during [[World War II]] in response to the need of the U.S. government to treat injured Allied soldiers; most of the penicillin that went ashore with the troops on [[D-Day]] was made by Pfizer.<ref name="Forbes">{{cite newsgroup | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnlamattina/2014/07/16/a-plan-for-big-pharma-involvement-in-superbug-rd/ | title=A Plan For Big Pharma Involvement In Superbug R&D | date=2014-07-16 | accessdate=9 August 2014}}</ref>

In the 1940s, penicillin became very inexpensive. As a result, Pfizer searched for new antibiotics with greater profit potential. Pfizer's discovery and commercialization of [[oxytetracycline|Terramycin (oxytetracycline)]] in 1950 changed the company from a manufacturer of [[fine chemical]]s to a research-based pharmaceutical company. To augment its research in fermentation technology, Pfizer developed a drug discovery program focusing on in vitro synthesis. Pfizer also established an animal health division in 1959 with an {{convert|700|acre|km2 |adj=on}} farm and research facility in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]].

By the 1950s, Pfizer had established offices in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Cuba, Mexico, Panama, Puerto Rico, and the United Kingdom. In 1960, the company moved its medical research laboratory operations out of New York City to a new facility in Groton, Connecticut. In 1980 Pfizer launched [[piroxicam|Feldene (piroxicam)]], a prescription [[anti-inflammatory]] medication that became Pfizer's first product to reach one billion United States dollars in total sales.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pfizer Inc: Exploring Our History 1951–1999|url=http://www.pfizer.com/about/history/1951-1999|publisher=Pfizer}}</ref>

During the 1980s and 1990s, Pfizer Corporation growth was sustained by the discovery and marketing of [[Zoloft]], [[Lipitor]], [[Norvasc]], [[Zithromax]], [[Aricept]], [[Diflucan]], and [[Viagra]].

=== 2000–10 ===
In this decade, Pfizer grew by mergers, including those with [[Warner–Lambert]] (2000), [[Pharmacia]] (2003), and [[Wyeth]] (2009).

In 2003, the company acquired [[Esperion Therapeutics]] for $1.3 billion (later selling the unit in 2008), protecting Lipitor from [[ETC-216]].<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmunos/2015/11/30/pfizer-does-not-need-a-merger-it-needs-a-rebellion/#63d5153e21d6|title=Pfizer Does Not Need A Merger, It Needs A Rebellion|first=Bernard|last=Munos|publisher=|accessdate=May 23, 2017}}</ref> In 2004, Pfizer announced it would acquire Meridica for $125 million.<ref name="auto"/> In 2005, the company made a number of acquisitions: Vicuron Pharmaceuticals for $1.9 billion, Idun for just less than $300 million and finally Angiosyn for $527 million.<ref name="auto"/>

On June 26, 2006, Pfizer announced it would sell its Consumer Healthcare unit (manufacturer of [[Listerine]], [[Nicorette]], [[Visine]], [[Sudafed]] and [[Neosporin]]) to [[Johnson & Johnson]] for $16.6&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmax.com/money/archives/articles/2006/6/26/082230.cfm |date=June 26, 2006 |title=Johnson & Johnson to Buy Pfizer Unit |accessdate=July 19, 2007 |publisher=MoneyNews.com }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref name="investor_dec_2006">{{cite press release| url = http://www.investor.jnj.com/releaseDetail.cfm?releaseid=223093| title = Johnson & Johnson Completes Acquisition Of Pfizer Consumer Healthcare| publisher=[[Johnson & Johnson]]| date = 20 December 2006}}</ref><ref name="NYT_dec_2006">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/27/business/27johnson.html| title = Johnson & Johnson Buys Pfizer Unit for $16.6&nbsp;billion| first=Stephanie | last=Saul| date = 27 June 2006| work=The New York Times |accessdate=24 November 2015}}</ref> Development of [[torcetrapib]], a drug that increases production of [[high density lipoprotein|HDL]], or "good cholesterol", which reduces [[low density lipoprotein|LDL]] thought to be correlated to heart disease, was cancelled in December 2006.

In September 2009, Pfizer pleaded guilty to the illegal marketing of the arthritis drug [[Valdecoxib#2009 settlement for off-label uses promotions|Bextra]] for uses unapproved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), and agreed to a $2.3 billion settlement, the largest health care fraud settlement at that time.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/03/business/03health.html "Pfizer pays $2.3 billion to settle marketing case"], ''The New York Times,'' September 2, 2009.</ref>

A July 2010 article in ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek|BusinessWeek]]'' reported that Pfizer was seeing more success in its battle against makers of [[counterfeit]] prescription drugs by pursuing civil lawsuits rather than criminal prosecution. Pfizer has hired customs and narcotics experts from all over the globe to track down fakes and assemble evidence that can be used to pursue civil suits for [[trademark infringement]]. Since 2007, Pfizer has spent $3.3&nbsp;million on investigations and legal fees and recovered about $5.1&nbsp;million, with another $5&nbsp;million tied up in ongoing cases.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bennett |first=Simeon |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_29/b4187021988297.htm |title=Pfizer: Civil Suits for Drug Counterfeiters |work=BusinessWeek |date=July 8, 2010 |accessdate=July 11, 2011}}</ref>

====Warner–Lambert acquisition====
Pfizer acquired [[Warner–Lambert]] in 2000 for $111.8&nbsp;billion.<ref>Pfizer, [http://www.pfizer.com/about/history/pfizer_warner_lambert.jsp 2000: Pfizer joins forces with Warner–Lambert], accessed April 7, 2010</ref> Warner–Lambert was founded as a [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] drug store in 1856 by William R. Warner. Inventing a tablet-coating process gained Warner a place in the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. Parke–Davis was founded in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] in 1866 by Hervey Parke and George Davis. Warner–Lambert took over Parke–Davis in 1976, and acquired [[Wilkinson Sword]] in 1993 and Agouron Pharmaceuticals in 1999.

====Pharmacia acquisition====
In 2002, Pfizer merged with [[Pharmacia]]. The merger was again driven in part by the desire to acquire full rights to a product, this time Celebrex ([[celecoxib]]), the [[COX-2 selective inhibitor]] previously jointly marketed by [[G. D. Searle & Company|Searle]] (acquired by Pharmacia) and Pfizer. In the ensuing years, Pfizer carried out a massive restructuring that resulted in numerous site closures and the loss of jobs including [[Terre Haute, Indiana|Terre Haute]], Indiana; [[Holland, Michigan|Holland]], Michigan; [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]], Connecticut; [[Brooklyn]], New York; [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]], UK; and [[Puerto Rico]].

Pharmacia had been formed by a series of mergers and acquisitions from its predecessors, including Searle, [[Upjohn]] and [[SUGEN]].

Searle was founded in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], in April 1888. The founder was Gideon Daniel Searle. In 1908, the company was incorporated in [[Chicago]], Illinois. In 1941, the company established headquarters in Skokie, Illinois. It was acquired by the [[Monsanto Company]], headquartered in [[St. Louis]], Missouri, in 1985.

The Upjohn Company was a pharmaceutical manufacturing firm founded in 1886 in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]], by Dr. [[William E. Upjohn]], an 1875 graduate of the [[University of Michigan]] medical school. The company was originally formed to make friable pills, which were specifically designed to be easily digested.  Greenstone was founded in 1993 by Upjohn as a generics division.<ref name=PT2008/> In 1995, Upjohn merged with Pharmacia, to form [[Pharmacia & Upjohn]]. Pharmacia was created in April 2000 through the merger of Pharmacia & Upjohn with the Monsanto Company and its G.D. Searle unit. The merged company was based in Peapack, New Jersey. The agricultural division was spun off from Pharmacia, as Monsanto, in preparation for the close of the acquisition by Pfizer.<ref name="urlPharmacia to Spin Off Monsanto Stake, Less Than 2 Years After Firms Merger Wall Street Journal 28nov01">{{cite web | url = http://www.mindfully.org/Industry/Monsanto-Pharmacia-SpinOff.htm | title = Pharmacia to spin-off Monsanto stake, less than 2 years after firms' merger |work=Wall Street Journal|publisher=mindfully.org|date=November 28, 2001}}</ref>

SUGEN, a company focused on [[protein kinase]] inhibitors, was founded in 1991 in [[Redwood City, California]], and acquired by [[Pharmacia]] in 1999. The company pioneered the use of ATP-mimetic small molecules to block [[signal transduction]]. After the Pfizer merger, the SUGEN site was shut down in 2003, with the loss of over 300 jobs, and several programs were transferred to Pfizer. These included [[sunitinib]] (Sutent), which was approved for human use by the FDA in January 2006, passed $1&nbsp;billion in annual revenues for Pfizer in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pfizer.com/files/annualreport/2010/financial/financial2010.pdf |title=Pfizer 2010 annual financial review, p 25. |format=PDF |accessdate=July 11, 2011}}</ref> A related compound, SU11654 ([[Toceranib]]), was also approved for [[Cancer in dogs|canine tumors]], and the [[ALK inhibitor]] [[Crizotinib]] also grew out of a SUGEN program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-06-05/pfizer-drug-targets-gene-flaw-to-shrink-lung-tumors-update1-.html |title=Pfizer Drug Targets Gene Flaw to Shrink Lung Tumors (Update1) |work=Businessweek |accessdate=July 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711122156/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-06-05/pfizer-drug-targets-gene-flaw-to-shrink-lung-tumors-update1-.html |archivedate=July 11, 2010 }}</ref>

In 2003, the new Pfizer made Greenstone (originally established as a division of Upjohn) its generic division, and its focus turned to selling [[authorized generics]] of Pfizer's products.<ref name=PT2008>{{cite news|last1=Staff|title=Greenstone LLC - A Successful Business Model|url=http://www.pharmacytimes.com/publications/supplement/2008/supp_2008-08/supp_2008-08_006|publisher=Pharmacy Times|date=August 1, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Hensley|first1=Scott|title=Pfizer to Make Generic Version of Its Zoloft|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115154467879893805|work=Wall Street Journal|date=29 June 2006}}</ref>

In 2008, Pfizer announced 275 job cuts at the Kalamazoo manufacturing facility. Kalamazoo was previously the world headquarters for the Upjohn Company.<ref name="urlPfizer plant in Michigan to cut 275 - FiercePharma">{{cite web | url = http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/pfizer-plant-michigan-cut-275/2008-07-15 | title = Pfizer plant in Michigan to cut 275 – FiercePharma | quote = }}</ref>

====Wyeth acquisition====
On January 26, 2009, after more than a year of talks between the two companies, Pfizer agreed to buy pharmaceuticals rival [[Wyeth]] for a combined US$68&nbsp;billion in cash, shares and loans, including some US$22.5&nbsp;billion lent by five major [[Wall Street]] banks. The deal cemented Pfizer's position as the largest pharmaceutical company in the world, with the merged company generating over US$20&nbsp;billion in cash each year, and was the largest corporate merger since [[AT&T Inc.|AT&T]] and [[BellSouth]]'s US$70&nbsp;billion deal in March 2006.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/26/business/26drug.html Pfizer Agrees to Pay $68&nbsp;billion for Rival Drug Maker Wyeth] By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and DUFF WILSON. January 26, 2009. ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref> The combined company was expected to save US$4&nbsp;billion annually through streamlining; however, as part of the deal, both companies must repatriate billions of dollars in revenue from foreign sources to the United States, which will result in higher tax costs. The acquisition was completed on October 15, 2009, making Wyeth a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer.<ref name=PfizerWyeth/>

The merger was broadly criticized. [[Harvard Business School]]'s Gary Pisano told [[The Wall Street Journal]], "the record of big mergers and acquisitions in Big Pharma has just not been good. There's just been an enormous amount of shareholder wealth destroyed."<ref>[http://industry.bnet.com/pharma/1000627/the-pfizer-wyeth-deal-worst-case-scenario/ The Pfizer–Wyeth Deal Worst-Case Scenario] By Jim Edwards | January 23, 2009 – BNET</ref> Analysts said at the time, "The Warner–Lambert and Pharmacia mergers do not appear to have achieved gains for shareholders, so it is unclear who benefits from the Wyeth–Pfizer merger to many critics."<ref name="Matthew">Matthew Karnitschnig, & Jonathan D.

====King Pharmaceuticals acquisition====
In October 2010, Pfizer agreed to buy [[King Pharmaceuticals]] for $3.6&nbsp;billion in cash or $14.25 per share: an approximately 40% premium over King's closing share price October 11, 2010.<ref name="htanna">{{cite news|title=Pfizer to buy King Pharma for $3.6&nbsp;billion in cash|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1216434820101012|agency=Reuters |accessdate=October 12, 2010 | date=October 12, 2010}}</ref>

On September 4, 2012, the FDA approved a Pfizer pill for a rare type of [[leukemia]]. The medicine, called Bosulif, treats [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]] (CML), a blood and [[bone marrow]] disease that usually affects older adults.<ref>{{cite web|title=FDA approves Pfizer leukemia drug |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/04/us-pfizer-leukemia-idUSBRE88314720120904 |publisher= Reuters|accessdate=4 September 2012}}</ref>

In July 2014, the company announced it would acquire Innopharma for $225&nbsp;million, plus up to $135&nbsp;million in milestone payments, in a deal that expanded Pfizer's range of generic and injectable drugs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/pfizer-to-acquire-innopharma-for-up-to-360m/81250112/?kwrd=pfizer%20acquire|title=GEN - News Highlights:Pfizer to Acquire InnoPharma for Up to $360M|work=GEN}}</ref>

====Attempted Allergan acquisition====
{{main article|Allergan, Plc}}
On November 23, 2015, Pfizer and [[Allergan, Plc]] announced their intention to merge for an approximate sum of $160&nbsp;billion, making it the largest pharmaceutical deal ever, and the third largest corporate merger in history. As part of the deal, the Pfizer CEO, Ian Read, was to remain as CEO and chairman of the new company, to be called "Pfizer plc", with Allergan's CEO, Brent Saunders, becoming president and chief operating officer. As part of the deal, Allergan shareholders would receive 11.3 shares of the company, with Pfizer shareholders receiving one. The terms proposed that the merged company would maintain Allergan's [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] domicile, resulting in the new company being subject to [[corporation tax]] at the Irish rate of 12.5%--considerably lower than the 35% rate that Pfizer paid at the time.<ref name="BBC_23_nov_2015">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-34900344|title=Pfizer seals $160bn Allergan deal to create drugs giant|work=BBC News |accessdate=24 November 2015 |date=23 November 2015 }}</ref> The deal was to constitute a [[reverse merger]], whereby Allergan acquired Pfizer, with the new company then changing its name to "Pfizer, plc".<ref name="Genegnews_2015">{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/pfizer-to-acquire-allergan-for-160b/81252011/|title=Pfizer to Acquire Allergan for $160B|work=GEN}}</ref><ref name="bloomberg_22_Nov_2015">{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-22/pfizer-allergan-said-to-be-close-to-150-billion-merger|title=Pfizer and Allergan to Combine With Joint Value of $160 Billion|author=Cynthia Koons|date=November 22, 2015|work=Bloomberg.com}}</ref><ref name="premier_2015">{{cite web|url=http://www.premierbiopharmaleader.com/en/media/press-releases/pfizer-and-allergan-to-combine/|title=Disclaimer - PremierBiopharmaLeader|work=premierbiopharmaleader.com}}</ref> The deal was expected to be completed in the second half of 2016, subject to certain conditions: US and EU approval, approval from both sets of shareholders, and the completion of Allergan's divestiture of its generics division to [[Teva Pharmaceuticals]] (expected in the first quarter of 2016).<ref name="Genegnews_2015"/> On April 6, 2016, Pfizer and Allergan announced they would be calling off the merger after the Obama administration introduced new laws intended to limit [[corporate inversion|corporate tax inversions]] (the extent to which companies could move their headquarters overseas in order to reduce the amount of taxes they pay).<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/07/business/dealbook/pfizer-allergan-merger.html?_r=0 | title=Pfizer and Allergan Call Off Merger After Tax-Rule Changes | work=New York Times | date=6 April 2016 | accessdate=6 April 2016 | author=Bray, Chad}}</ref>

===Brigham Young University===
Controversy arose over the drug "Celebrex". [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) said that a professor of chemistry, Dr. [[Daniel L. Simmons]], discovered an enzyme in the 1990s that would later lead towards the development of Celebrex. BYU was originally seeking 15% royalty on sales, which would equate to $9.7 billion. The court filings show that a research agreement was made with [[Monsanto]], whose pharmaceutical business was later acquired by Pfizer, to develop a better aspirin. The enzyme that Dr. Simmons claims to have discovered would induce pain and inflammation while causing gastrointestinal problems, which Celebrex is used to reduce those issues. A battle ensued, lasting over six years, because BYU claimed that Pfizer did not give him credit or compensation while Pfizer claims it had met all obligations regarding the Monsanto agreement. This culminated in a $450 million amicable settlement without going to trial. Pfizer said it would take a $450 million charge against first quarter earnings to settle.<ref>[http://www.ajc.com/health/pfizer-settles-lawsuit-involving-1429314.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601055014/http://www.ajc.com/health/pfizer-settles-lawsuit-involving-1429314.html |date=1 June 2012 }}</ref>

===Litigation in which Pfizer was not a party===
Pfizer was discussed as part of the [[Kelo v. New London]] case that was decided by [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in 2005.  In February 1998 Pfzer announced it would build a research facility in  [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], Connecticut, and local planners, hoping to promote [[economic development]] and build on the influx of jobs the planned facility would bring to the town, created a plan that included seizing property to redevelop it under [[eminent domain]], and local residents sued to stop the seizure.  The case went to the Supreme Court, and with regard to Pfizer, the court cited a prior decision that said: "The record clearly demonstrates that the development plan was not intended to serve the interests of Pfizer, Inc., or any other private entity, but rather, to revitalize the local economy by creating temporary and permanent jobs, generating a significant increase in tax revenue, encouraging spin-off economic activities and maximizing public access to the waterfront”.<ref name=Kelo>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/04-108.ZO.html|title=Kelo V.

Pfizer has inherited Wyeth's liabilities in the [[American Cyanamid]] site in Bridgewater, New Jersey. This site is highly toxic and an EPA declared Superfund site.

Pfizer is one of the single largest lobbying interests in United States politics. For example, in the first 9 months of 2009 Pfizer spent over $16.3&nbsp;million on lobbying US congressional lawmakers, making them the sixth largest lobbying interest in the US (following Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), which ranked fourth but also represents many of their interests). A spokeswoman for Pfizer said the company “wanted to make sure our voice is heard in this conversation” in regards to the company's expenditure of $25&nbsp;million in 2010 to lobby health care reform.<ref>Steinbrook, R., 2009.
