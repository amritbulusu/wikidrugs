'''Salmeterol''' is a [[Long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist|long-acting β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptor agonist]] (LABA) used in the maintenance and prevention of [[asthma]] symptoms and maintenance of [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) symptoms.<ref name=GOLD>{{cite web|title=global initiative for chronic obstructive disease|url=http://www.goldcopd.org/uploads/users/files/GOLDReport_April112011.pdf|website=goldcopd.org|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref> Symptoms of [[bronchospasm]] include [[Dyspnea|shortness of breath]], [[Wheeze|wheezing]], [[cough]]ing and chest tightness. It is also used to prevent breathing difficulties during exercise ([[exercise-induced bronchoconstriction]]).<ref name=NIH>{{cite web|title=National Asthma Education and Prevention Program|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a695001.html#why|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref> It is marketed as Serevent in the US.<ref name=medicinet>{{cite web|title=Salmeterol inhalation index|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/salmeterol/page2.htm|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref> It is available as a [[dry powder inhaler]] that releases a powdered form of the drug.

==Medical uses==
Salmeterol is used in moderate-to-severe persistent asthma following previous treatment with a short-acting [[Beta2-adrenergic agonist|β<sub>2</sub> adrenoreceptor agonist]] (SABA) such as  [[Salbutamol|salbutamol (albuterol)]]. LABAs should not be used as a monotherapy, instead, they should be used concurrently with an inhaled corticosteroid, such as [[beclometasone dipropionate]] or [[fluticasone propionate]] in the treatment of [[asthma]] to minimize serious reactions such as asthma-related deaths. In [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), LABAs may be used as monotherapy or in combination with corticosteroids. In exercise-induced [[bronchospasm]] monotherapy may be indicated in patients without persistent asthma. LABAs should not be used to treat acute symptoms.<ref name="GOLD"/><ref name=GINA>{{cite web|title=global initiative for astma|url=http://www.ginasthma.org/local/uploads/files/GINA_Report_2014_Aug12.pdf|website=ginasthma.org|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref><ref name=MHRA>{{cite web|title=Use of long-acting beta agonist in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Safetyinformation/DrugSafetyUpdate/CON087967|website=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Safetyinformation/DrugSafetyUpdate/CON087967|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref>

The primary noticeable difference of salmeterol from [[salbutamol]], and other short-acting [[Beta2-adrenergic agonist|β<sub>2</sub> adrenoreceptor agonist]]s (SABAs), is its duration of action. Salmeterol lasts approximately 12 hours in comparison with the [[salbutamol]], which last about 4&ndash;6 hours.<ref name="GOLD"/><ref name="GINA"/>

When used regularly every day as prescribed, inhaled salmeterol decreases the number and severity of asthma attacks. However, like all LABA medications, it is not for use in relieving an asthma attack that has already started.

Inhaled salmeterol works like other β<sub>2</sub> agonists, causing bronchodilation by relaxing the smooth muscle in the airway so as to treat the exacerbation of asthma. The long duration of action occurs by the molecules initially diffusing into the plasma membrane of the lung cells, and then slowly being released back outside the cell where they can come into contact with the β<sub>2</sub> adrenoreceptors, with the long carbon chain forming an anchor in the membrane. Interestingly, salmeterol binding to the β<sub>2</sub> adrenoreceptor does not induce desensitization or internalization of receptors which may also contribute to its long therapeutic duration of action. [[Formoterol]] has been demonstrated to have a faster onset of action than salmeterol as a result of a lower [[lipophilic]]ity, and has also been demonstrated to be more potent&mdash;a 12&nbsp;''µ''g dose of formoterol has been demonstrated to be equivalent to a 50&nbsp;''µ''g dose of salmeterol.<ref name="NIH"/><ref name=Partnership>{{cite web|title=Recommended Medication for Asthma|url=http://www.partnershiphp.org/Members/HealthEd/Asthma%20pdf/LongTermControlMeds12-adult_043010.pdf|website=www.partnershiphp.org}}</ref>

===Pregnancy and lactation===
The FDA assigns a Category C to salmeterol in pregnancy. Salmeterol use during pregnancy must be decided based on the risks versus benefits to the mother. There are no well-controlled studies with salmeterol in pregnant women. Some animal studies showed developmental malformation when the mother was given several clinical doses orally. In rats, salmeterol xinafoate is excreted in the milk. However, since there are no data to show excretion of salmeterol in a mother's breast milk, a decision on whether to continue or discontinue therapy should be decided based on the important benefits it provides to the mother. Pregnant and lactating women should consult their doctors before using salmeterol.<ref name=accessdata>{{cite web|title=Serevent Diskus|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2007/020692s028lbl.pdf|website=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2007/020692s028lbl.pdf|accessdate=3 November 2014}}</ref>

==Side effects==
Due to its vasodilation properties, the common side effects of salmeterol are [[dizziness]], [[Sinusitis|sinus infection]], and [[Migraine|migraine headaches]]. In most cases, salmeterol side effects are minor and either don't require treatment or can easily be treated. Certain side effects, however, should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately. Some of these more serious side effects include a very fast heart rate, [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]], and worsening [[Dyspnea|breathing problems]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Medtv|url=http://asthma.emedtv.com/salmeterol/side-effects-of-salmeterol.html|publisher=HealthSavy|accessdate=8 March 2012}}</ref>

==Structure-activity relationship==
Salmeterol has an aryl alkyl group with a chain length of 11 atoms from the amine. This bulkiness makes the compound more lipophilic and it also makes it selective to β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptors.<ref>[http://pharmaxchange.info/notes/medicinal_chemistry/adrenergics_cholinergics.html Medicinal Chemistry of Adrenergics and Cholinergics]</ref>

==History==
[[Image:AsthmaInhaler.jpg|thumb|Previously Used Metered Dose [[inhaler]] of Serevent brand salmeterol]]
[[File:Salmeterol diskus.jpg|thumb|A typical Dry Powder inhaler Salmeterol diskus]]
Salmeterol, first marketed and manufactured by [[GlaxoSmithKline|Glaxo]] (now GlaxoSmithKline, GSK) in the 1980s, was released as Serevent in 1990.<ref name="FDA"/> The product is marketed by GSK under the Allen & Hanburys brand in the UK.

In November 2005, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] released a health advisory, alerting the public to findings that show the use of long-acting β<sub>2</sub> agonists could lead to a worsening of symptoms, and in some cases death.<ref name=fda>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/infopage/LABA/default.htm |title=Advair Diskus, Advair HFA, Brovana, Foradil, Perforomist, Serevent Diskus, and Symbicort Information (Long Acting Beta Agonists)|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref>

While the use of inhaled LABAs are still recommended in asthma guidelines for the resulting improved symptom control,<ref name=SIGN>British Thoracic Society & Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN). ''British Guideline on the Management of Asthma''. Guideline No. 63. Edinburgh:SIGN; 2004. ([http://www.sign.ac.uk/guidelines/fulltext/63/index.html HTML], [http://www.sign.ac.uk/pdf/sign63.pdf Full PDF], [http://www.sign.ac.uk/pdf/qrg63.pdf Summary PDF])</ref> further concerns have been raised. A large meta-analysis of pooled results from 19 trials with 33,826 participants, suggests that salmeterol may increase the small risks of asthma-related deaths, and this additional risk is not reduced with the additional use of inhaled steroids (e.g., as with the combination product [[fluticasone/salmeterol]]).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Salpeter S, Buckley N, Ormiston T, Salpeter E | title = Meta-analysis: effect of long-acting beta agonists on severe asthma exacerbations and asthma-related deaths | journal = Ann Intern Med | volume = 144 | issue = 12 | pages = 904–12 | year = 2006 | pmid=16754916 | doi=10.7326/0003-4819-144-12-200606200-00126}}</ref>
This seems to occur because although LABAs relieve asthma symptoms, they also promote bronchial inflammation and sensitivity without warning.<ref>{{cite news | author=Krishna Ramanujan | title=Common asthma inhalers cause up to 80 percent of asthma-related deaths, Cornell and Stanford researchers assert  | url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/June06/AsthmaDeaths.kr.html | date=June 9, 2006 | publisher=ChronicalOnline - Cornell University}}</ref>

==Long-acting β<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptor agonists (LABAs)==
Currently available long-acting β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptor agonists include salmeterol (inhaled or sustained-release oral), [[formoterol]], [[bambuterol]] and some others. Combinations of inhaled steroids and these long-acting bronchodilators are becoming more widespread; the most common combination currently in use is [[fluticasone/salmeterol]] (brand names '''Seretide''' <small>([[United Kingdom|UK]])</small> and '''Advair''' <small>([[United States|U.S.]])</small>).
