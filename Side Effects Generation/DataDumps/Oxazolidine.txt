An''' oxazolidine''' is a five-membered ring compound consisting of three [[carbon]]s, a [[nitrogen]], and an [[oxygen]]. The oxygen and NH are the 1 and 3 positions, respectively. In oxazolidine derivatives, there is always a carbon between the oxygen and the nitrogen (or it would be an ''isoxazolidine'').<ref>{{cite web | url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?sid=3881507 | title=SID 3881507 -- PubChem Substance Summary | work=The PubChem Project | publisher=United States National Center for Biotechnology Information | accessdate=13 December 2005}}</ref><ref>Dr Neil G Carter [http://www.chemsoc.org/pdf/gcn/Industrial.pdf OXAZOLIDINE DILUENTS: REACTING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT] Industrial Copolymers Limited</ref> All of the carbons in oxazolidines are reduced (compare to [[oxazole]] and [[oxazoline]]). Some of their derivatives, the [[oxazolidinedione]]s, are used as [[anticonvulsant]]s.

Oxazolidines have been around for over 100 years.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/cr60165a005 | volume=53 | title=The Oxazolidines. | journal=Chemical Reviews | pages=309–352 | last1 = Bergmann | first1 = Ernst D.}}</ref>

==Dioxooxazolidines==
Oxazolidines where the carbon centers at the 1 and 3 positions are [[carbonyl group|carbonyl]]s are called dioxooxazolidines.  Some of these are commercial [[fungicide]]s including chlozolinate, [[vinclozolin]], and [[famoxadone]].<ref>Franz Müller, Peter Ackermann and Paul Margot "Fungicides, Agricultural, 2. Individual Fungicides" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.o12_o06}}</ref>

==Bisoxazolidines==
'''Bisoxazolidines''' are chemical compounds that contain two oxazolidine rings, they are used as performance modifiers in [[polyurethane]] coatings and paints. The rings [[hydrolysis|hydrolyze]] in the presence of moisture to give [[amine]] and [[hydroxyl]] groups, these can then react with [[diisocyanate]]s to form a coating.<ref>[http://www.chemsoc.org/chembytes/ezine/2001/daniels_oct01.htm Emission control] chembytes e-zine 2001.</ref> The use of a bisoxazolidine in a polyurethane systems can prevent the unwanted reaction between isocyanate and moisture resulting in coating defects, as a result of carbon dioxide release. This moisture triggered curing route is preferential to moisture cure.

The choice of linker between the two oxazolidine rings has a large impact on the performance when used to cure isocyanates. A rigid linker group increases a polyurethanes toughness. A flexible linker group imparts flexibility and increases elongation of a coating. These differences are the reason why bisoxazolidines are used to enhance the performance of polyurethane systems. Usually the rings are linked by esters, urethanes, carbonate or have the two rings fused together.

==Isoxazolidines==
In an '''isoxazolidine''' nitrogen and oxygen occupy positions 1 and 2 in the ring:

It is the saturated relative of [[Isoxazole]].

* [[Thiazole]],  an analog with the oxygen replaced by a sulfur.
* [[Benzoxazole]], where the oxazole is fused to another aromatic ring.
* [[Pyrrole]], an analog without the oxygen atom.
* [[Furan]], an analog without the nitrogen atom.
* [[Oxazoline]], which has only one double bond reduced.
* [[Oxazolidinedione]], which has two in-cycle keto groups (a carbamate and a lactam).
* [[Oxazolidinone]], which has an in-cycle carbamate.
