'''Milnacipran''' (trade names '''Ixel''', '''Savella''', '''Dalcipran''', '''Toledomin''') is a [[serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] (SNRI) used in the clinical treatment of [[fibromyalgia]]. It is not approved for the clinical treatment of [[major depressive disorder]] in the USA, but it is in other countries.

}}</ref> concluded that there were no statistically significant differences in efficacy, acceptability and tolerability when comparing milnacipran with other antidepressant agents. However, compared with [[Tricyclic antidepressant|TCAs]], significantly fewer patients taking milnacipran dropped out due to adverse events. As with other antidepressants, 1 to 3 weeks may elapse before significant antidepressant action becomes clinically evident.

===Fibromyalgia===
During its development for [[fibromyalgia]], milnacipran was evaluated utilizing a composite responder approach. To be considered as a responder for the composite ‘treatment of ﬁbromyalgia’ endpoint, each patient had to show concurrent and clinically meaningful improvements in pain, physical function and global impression of disease status. A systematic review in 2015 showed moderate relief for a minority of people with fibromyalgia. Milnacipran was associated with increased adverse events and discontinuing use of the drug.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cording|first1=M|last2=Derry|first2=S|last3=Phillips|first3=T|last4=Moore|first4=RA|last5=Wiffen|first5=PJ|title=Milnacipran for pain in fibromyalgia in adults.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=20 October 2015|issue=10|pages=CD008244|pmid=26482422}}</ref>

==Contraindications==
Administration of milnacipran should be avoided in individuals with the following:

* Known hypersensitivity to milnacipran (absolute contraindication)
* Patients under 15 years of age (no sufficient clinical data)
* Concomitant treatment with irreversible [[MAO inhibitor]]s (e.g. [[tranylcypromine]] (Parnate), [[phenelzine]] (Nardil), >10&nbsp;mg [[selegiline]]) or [[digitalis]] [[glycoside]]s is an absolute contraindication.

Administration of milnacipran should be done with caution in individuals with the following:

* Concomitant treatment with parenteral [[epinephrine]], [[norepinephrine]], with [[clonidine]], [[Reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A|reversible MAO-A Inhibitors]] (such as [[moclobemide]], [[toloxatone]]) or 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>-agonists (e.g. [[triptan]] migraine drugs)
* Advanced renal disease (decreased dosage required)
* Hypertrophy of the prostate gland (possibly urination hesitancy induced), with hypertension and heart disease (tachycardia may be a problem) as well as with open angle glaucoma.

Milnacipran should not be used during pregnancy because it may cross the placenta barrier and no clinical data exists on harmful effects in humans and animal studies. Milnacipran is contraindicated during lactation because it is excreted in the milk, and it is not known if it is harmful to the newborn.

==Side effects==
The most frequently occurring adverse reactions (≥ 5% and greater than placebo) were nausea, headache, constipation, dizziness, insomnia, hot flush, hyperhydrosis, vomiting, palpitations, heart rate increase, dry mouth, and hypertension [FDA Savella prescribing information]. Milnacipran can have a significant impact on sexual functions, including both a decrease in sexual desire and ability{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; most papers indicate the opposite.|date=March 2015}}. Milnacipran can cause pain of the testicles in men.  The incidence of cardiovascular and [[anticholinergic]] side effects was significantly lower compared to [[Tricyclic antidepressant|TCA]]s as a controlled study with over 3,300 patients revealed. Elevation of [[liver enzymes]] without signs of symptomatic liver disease has been infrequent. Mood swing to [[mania]] has also been seen and dictates termination of treatment. In [[psychotic]] patients emergence of [[delirium]] has been noticed. Milnacipran has a low incidence of [[sedation]] but improves [[sleep]] (both duration and quality) in depressed patients. In [[Psychomotor agitation|agitated]] patients or those with [[suicidal]] thoughts additive sedative/anxiolytic treatment is usually indicated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/022256s014s015lbl.pdf |title=www.accessdata.fda.gov |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Interactions==
* [[MAOI]]s — hyperserotonergia ([[serotonin syndrome]]), potentially lethal hypertensive crisis
* 5-HT<sub>1</sub> receptor agonists — coronary vasoconstriction with risk of [[angina pectoris]] and [[myocardial infarction]]
* [[Epinephrine]], [[norepinephrine]] (also in local anesthesia) — hypertensive crisis and/or possible cardiac arrhythmia
* [[Clonidine]] — antihypertensive action of clonidine may be antagonized
* [[Digitalis]] — hemodynamic actions increased
* [[Triptans]] — there have been rare postmarketing reports of hyperserotonergia (serotonin syndrome). If concomitant treatment of milnacipran with a triptan is clinically warranted, careful observation of patient is advised when starting or increasing dosages.<ref>National Institute of Health. ''DailyMed.'' http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=08214b30-3dab-4621-a6c0-6bb68529dee3</ref>
* [[Alcohol]] — no interactions known; however, because milnacipran can cause mild elevation of liver enzymes, caution is recommended; the FDA advises against the concomitant use of alcohol and milnacipran

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Milnacipran [[reuptake inhibitor|inhibit]]s the [[reuptake]] of [[serotonin]] and [[norepinephrine]] in an approximately 1:3 ratio, respectively; in practical use this means a relatively balanced action upon both [[neurotransmitter]]s. Increasing both neurotransmitters concentration simultaneously works synergistically to treat both depression and fibromyalgia. Milnacipran exerts no significant actions on [[H1 receptor|H<sub>1</sub>]], [[alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>]], [[D1 receptor|D<sub>1</sub>]], [[D2 receptor|D<sub>2</sub>]], and [[muscarinic receptor|mACh]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s, nor on [[benzodiazepine site|benzodiazepine]] and [[opioid receptor|opioid]] [[binding site]]s.<ref name="Moret">{{cite journal

Recently, [[levomilnacipran]], the [[levorotatory]] [[enantiomer]] of milnacipran, has been found to act as an [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] of [[beta-secretase 1|beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1]] (BACE-1), which is responsible for [[β-amyloid]] plaque formation, and hence may  be a potentially useful drug in the treatment of [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref name="pmid25345508">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rizvi SM, Shaikh S, Khan M, Biswas D, Hameed N, Shakil S | title = Fetzima (levomilnacipran), a drug for major depressive disorder as a dual inhibitor for human serotonin transporters and beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 | journal = CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets | volume = 13 | issue = 8 | pages = 1427–31 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25345508 | doi = 10.2174/1871527313666141023145703| url = }}</ref> Other BACE-1 inhibitors, such as [[CTS-21166]] (ASP1720), [[MK-8931]], and [[AZD3293]] are currently in [[clinical trial]]s for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.<ref name="pmid25100992">{{cite journal | vauthors = Menting KW, Claassen JA | title = β-secretase inhibitor; a promising novel therapeutic drug in Alzheimer's disease | journal = Front Aging Neurosci | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 165 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25100992 | pmc = 4104928 | doi = 10.3389/fnagi.2014.00165 | url = }}</ref>

===Pharmacokinetics===
Milnacipran is well absorbed after oral dosing and has a bioavailability of 85%. Meals do not have an influence on the rapidity and extent of absorption. Peak plasma concentrations are reached 2 hours after oral dosing. The elimination half-life of 8 hours is not increased by liver impairment and old age, but by significant renal disease. Milnacipran is conjugated to the inactive glucuronide and excreted in the urine as unchanged drug and conjugate. Only traces of active metabolites are found.

==History==
Milnacipran was first approved for the treatment of major depressive episodes in [[France]] in December 1996. It is currently marketed (as '''Ixel''') for this indication in over 45 countries worldwide including several [[Europe]]an countries such as [[Austria]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Portugal]], and [[Russia]]. It is also available in [[Japan]] (as '''Toledomin''') and [[Mexico]] (as '''Dalcipran'''). [[Cypress Bioscience]] bought the exclusive rights for approval and marketing of the drug for any purpose in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] in 2003 from the manufacturer [[Laboratoires Pierre Fabre]].

In January 2009 the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved milnacipran (under the brand name '''Savella''') only for the treatment of [[fibromyalgia]], making it the third medication approved for this purpose in the United States. In July and November 2009, the [[European Medicines Agency]] refused marketing authorization for a milnacipran product (under the brand name '''Impulsor''') for the treatment of fibromylagia.<ref name="Doc.
