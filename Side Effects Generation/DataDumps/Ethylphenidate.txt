'''Ethylphenidate''' ('''EPH''') is a [[stimulant|psychostimulant]] and a close [[structural analog|analog]] of [[methylphenidate]].

Ethylphenidate acts as both a [[dopamine reuptake inhibitor]] and [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]], meaning it effectively boosts the levels of the [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]] [[neurotransmitter]]s in the brain,  by binding to, and partially blocking the transporter [[protein]]s that normally remove those [[monoamine]]s from the [[synaptic cleft]].

However, considering the close similarities between ethylphenidate and methylphenidate and the fact that methylphenidate, like cocaine, actually does not primarily act as a "classical" reuptake inhibitor, but rather as an "[[inverse agonist]] at the [[Dopamine transporter|DAT]]" (also called a "[[negative allosteric modulator]] at the DAT"),<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24953830 | title=Dopamine reuptake transporter (DAT) "inverse agonism"--a novel hypothesis to explain the enigmatic pharmacology of cocaine. |author1=Heal DJ |author2=Gosden J |author3=Smith SL | journal=[[Neuropharmacology (journal)|Neuropharmacology]] | date= Dec 2014 | volume=87 | pages=19–14 | doi=10.1016/j.neuropharm.2014.06.012 | pmid=24953830 | quote = In vivo experiments in animals demonstrate that cocaine's monoaminergic pharmacology is profoundly different from that of other prescribed monoamine reuptake inhibitors, with the exception of methylphenidate. These findings led us to conclude that the highly unusual stimulant profile of cocaine and related compounds, eg methylphenidate, is not mediated by monoamine reuptake inhibition alone. We describe the experimental findings which suggest cocaine serves as a negative allosteric modulator to alter the function of the dopamine reuptake transporter (DAT) and reverse its direction of transport. This results in a firing-dependent, retro-transport of dopamine into the synaptic cleft. [...] Because the physiological role of DAT is to remove dopamine from the synapse and the action of cocaine is the opposite of this, we have postulated that cocaine's effect is analogous to an inverse agonist.}}</ref> it is at least very likely that ethylphenidate also primarily acts as an inverse DAT agonist instead of (or at least only secondarily) as a classical reuptake inhibitor (which could be called a "[[competitive antagonist]] at the DAT" using a similar terminology as "negative allosteric modulator at the DAT", which per definition means that its mechanism is [[Receptor antagonist#Non-competitive|non-competitive]]).

There have been anecdotal reports of a perforated septum resulting from even just a few uses of ethylphenidate by insufflation (snorting). Some users also report the drug is extremely painful to insufflate. This is almost certainly due to the ethylphenidate that is sourced from [[grey market]] vendors containing caustic impurities. There is absolutely no evidence that pure ethylphenidate would have caustic effects, since ethylphenidate only differs from methylphenidate in that MPH's [[methyl acetate]] is replaced with an [[ethyl acetate]] in EPH. Methyl acetate and ethyl acetate have exactly the same [[pKa]] of 25,<ref>https://owl.oit.umass.edu/departments/OrganicChemistry/appendix/pKaTable.html</ref><ref>https://www.proprofs.com/flashcards/story.php?title=pka-values_1</ref> which means that they are both even less acidic than water, which has a pKa of 14<ref>https://chem.libretexts.org/Core/Organic_Chemistry/Fundamentals/What_is_the_pKa_of_water%3F</ref> (the lower the pKa the stronger the acid). Considering the fact that methylphenidate has been [[recreational drug use|recreationally]] insufflated by 4% of the general population<ref>{{cite journal| pmid=19630746 | volume=2 | issue=2 | title=Illicit methylphenidate use: a review of prevalence, availability, pharmacology, and consequences | year=2009 | journal=Curr Drug Abuse Rev | pages=157–76 | last1 = Bogle | first1 = KE | last2 = Smith | first2 = BH}}</ref> without any reports of perforated septums and since ethylphenidate is certainly not more [[Corrosive substance|corrosive]] than methylphenidate, it is clear that the cause for the pain caused can ony be impurities.

==Pharmacokinetics==
