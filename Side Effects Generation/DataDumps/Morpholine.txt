'''Morpholine''' is an [[Organic compound|organic]] [[chemical compound]] having the [[chemical formula]] [[oxygen|O]]([[carbon|C]][[hydrogen|H]]<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>[[nitrogen|N]]H. This [[heterocycle]] features both [[amine]] and [[ether]] [[functional group]]s. Because of the amine, morpholine is a [[base (chemistry)|base]]; its [[conjugate acid]] is called morpholinium. For example, treating morpholine with [[hydrochloric acid]] makes the [[salt]] morpholinium chloride.

==Production==
Morpholine may be produced by the dehydration of [[diethanolamine]] with [[sulfuric acid]]:<ref name = weissermel>{{cite book | title = Industrial Organic Chemistry |first1=Klaus |last1=Weissermel |first2=Hans-Jürgen |last2=Arpe |first3=Charlet R. |last3=Lindley |first4=Stephen |last4=Hawkins | publisher = [[Wiley-VCH]] | year = 2003 | isbn = 3-527-30578-5 | pages = 159–161 | chapter = Chapter 7.

==Uses==
===Industrial applications===
Morpholine is a common additive, in parts per million [[concentration]]s, for [[pH]] adjustment in both [[fossil fuel power plant|fossil fuel]] and [[nuclear power plant]] [[steam]] systems. Morpholine is used because its [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] is about the same as [[water (molecule)|water]], so once it is added to the water, its concentration becomes distributed rather evenly in both the water and steam [[phase (matter)|phases]]. Its pH-adjusting qualities then become distributed throughout the steam plant to provide [[corrosion]] protection. Morpholine is often used in conjunction with low concentrations of [[hydrazine]] or [[ammonia]] to provide a comprehensive all-volatile treatment chemistry for corrosion protection for the steam systems of such plants. Morpholine decomposes reasonably slowly in the absence of [[oxygen]] at the high [[temperature]]s and [[pressure]]s in these steam systems.

===Organic synthesis===
Morpholine undergoes most [[chemical reaction]]s typical for other secondary [[amine]]s, though the presence of the ether oxygen withdraws electron density from the nitrogen, rendering it less nucleophilic (and less basic) than structurally similar secondary amines such as [[piperidine]]. For this reason, it forms a stable chloramine (CAS#23328-69-0).<ref>{{OrgSynth | last1= Lindsay Smith |first1=J. R. |last2=McKeer |first2=L. C. |last3=Taylor |first3=J.

It is commonly used to generate [[enamine]]s.<ref>{{OrgSynth | authorlink = Ryoji Noyori|last1=Noyori |first1=R. |last2=Yokoyama |first2=K. |last3=Hayakawa |first3=Y. | title = Cyclopentenones from α,α′-Dibromoketones and Enamines: 2,5-Dimethyl-3-Phenyl-2-Cyclopenten-1-one | collvol = 6 | collvolpages = 520 | year = 1988 | prep = CV6P0520}}</ref>

Morpholine is widely used in [[organic synthesis]]. For example, it is a building block in the preparation of the antibiotic [[linezolid]], the anticancer agent [[gefitinib]] (Iressa) and the analgesic [[dextromoramide]].

In research and in industry, the low cost and [[Polarity (chemistry)|polarity]] of morpholine lead to its common use as a [[solvent]] for chemical reactions.

=== Producers ===
Most (as above) is widespread in Europe and the USA; accordingly, producers in Europe and the USA are able to cover the domestic and export markets.

=== Agriculture ===
==== As a fruit coating ====
Morpholine is used as a chemical [[emulsifier]] in the process of waxing fruit. Naturally, fruits make waxes to protect against insects and fungal contamination, but this can be lost as the fruit is cleaned. A small amount of new wax is applied to replace it. Morpholine is used as an emulsifier and solubility aid for [[shellac]], which is used as a wax for fruit coating.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Raymond G. |last1=McGuire |first2=Dimitrios A. |last2=Dimitroglou | url = http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a713655919~db=all  | title = Evaluation of Shellac and Sucrose Ester Fruit Coating Formulations that Support Biological Control of Post-harvest Grapefruit Decay | journal = Bio-control Science and Technology | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | year = 1999 | pages = 53–65}}</ref> The [[European Union]] has forbidden the use of morpholine in fruit coating.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.salltd.co.uk/news_item.jsp?file=2010-09-29%20Morpholine%20residues%20detected%20in%20apples%20from%20Chile.html | title = Morpholine | publisher = Scientific Analysis Laboratories Ltd}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nwhort.org/UKCountryAlert.html | title = Morpholine Issues in the United Kingdom | date = September 28, 2010 | publisher = Northwest Horticultural Council}}</ref>

====As a component in fungicides====
Morpholine derivatives used as agricultural fungicides in cereals are known as [[ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitor]]s.
