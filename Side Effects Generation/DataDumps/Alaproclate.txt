'''Alaproclate''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]) (developmental code name '''GEA-654''') is a [[drug]] that was being [[drug development|developed]] as an [[antidepressant]] by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical company]] [[Astra AB]] (now [[AstraZeneca]]) in the 1970s. It acts as a [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SSRI), and along with [[zimelidine]] and [[indalpine]], was one of the first of its kind. Development was discontinued due to the observation of [[liver toxicity|liver complication]]s in [[animal testing on rodents|rodent studies]]. In addition to its SSRI properties, alaproclate has been found to act as a non-competitive [[NMDA receptor antagonist]], but does not have discriminative stimulus properties similar to [[phencyclidine]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Alaproclate acts as a potent, reversible and noncompetitive antagonist of the NMDA receptor coupled ion flow |vauthors =Wilkinson A, Courtney M, Westlind-Danielsson A, Hallnemo G, Akerman KE |journal=The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics |date=December 1994 |volume=271 |issue=3 |pages=1314–9 |pmid=7996440 |url=http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7996440 |subscription=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Evaluation of the phencyclidine-like discriminative stimulus effects of novel NMDA channel blockers in rats |vauthors =Nicholson KL, Balster RL |journal=Psychopharmacology |date=November 2003 |volume=170 |issue=2 |pages=215–24 |pmid=12851738 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00213-003-1527-6 |subscription=yes |doi=10.1007/s00213-003-1527-6}}</ref>
