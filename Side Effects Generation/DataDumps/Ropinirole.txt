'''Ropinirole''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]; trade names '''Requip''', '''Repreve''', '''Ronirol''', '''Adartrel''') is a [[dopamine agonist]] of the non-[[ergoline]] class of medications. It is manufactured by [[GlaxoSmithKline]] (GSK), [[Cipla]], [[Dr. Reddy's Laboratories]] and [[Sun Pharmaceutical]]. It is used in the [[therapy|treatment]] of [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[restless legs syndrome]] (RLS).  Ropinirole is one of three medications approved by the FDA to treat RLS, the other two being [[pramipexole]] (Mirapex) and [[gabapentin enacarbil]] (Horizant).  The discovery of the drug's utility in RLS has been used as an example of successful [[drug repurposing]].<ref name=Lipp_GEN2008>{{Cite news

}} ''Note: The opinion that ropinirole's use in RLS was a successful example of drug repurposes was reported as being that of Josef Scheiber, a post-doctoral fellow at the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research.''</ref>

Ropinirole's patent expired in May 2008, and the drug is now available in [[generic drug|generic]] form.<ref>[http://www.tevausa.com/default.aspx?pageid=75 New pharmaceutical products: Ceftriaxon-Rocephin, Granisetron-Kytril, Ipratropium-Albuterol]</ref>

==Medical uses==
Ropinirole is prescribed for mainly [[Parkinson's disease]], RLS and [[extrapyramidal symptoms]]. It can also reduce the side effects caused by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, including Parkinsonism syndrome as well as [[sexual dysfunction]] and [[erectile dysfunction]] caused by either [[SSRI]]s<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00334048}} - "Treating Sexual Dysfunction From SSRI Medication: a Study Comparing Requip CR to Placebo"</ref> or antipsychotics.

== Dosage ==
Ropinirole in the Requip form is available in various preparations, ranging from a 0.25&nbsp;mg tablet to a 5&nbsp;mg tablet. The primary reason is [[dose titration]]. This implies that the person taking Requip has to closely interact and communicate with the primary care physician with regard to how much should actually be taken by the patient.

For Parkinson's disease, the maximum recommended dose is 24&nbsp;mg per day, taken in three separate doses spread throughout the day. The maximum dose recommendations of ropinirole for subjects with [[Chronic kidney disease|end stage renal disease]] (ESRD) should be reduced by 25% compared with those recommended for subjects with normal renal function. A 25% dose reduction represents a more straightforward dosage regimen in terms of available tablet strength, compared with a 30% dose reduction.<ref name="RPL"/>

For RLS, the maximum recommended dose is 4&nbsp;mg per day, taken 1 to 3 hours before bedtime.  A 52-week [[open label study]] had a mean dosage of 1.90&nbsp;mg, once daily 1 to 3 hours before bedtime.<ref name="52wkOpenLabel">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Garcia-Borreguero D, Grunstein R, Sridhar G, etal |title=A 52-week open-label study of the long-term safety of ropinirole in patients with restless leg syndrome |journal=Sleep Med. |volume=8 |issue=7–8 |pages=742–52 |date=November 2007 |pmid=17512789 |doi=10.1016/j.sleep.2006.09.009 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1389-9457(06)00622-8}}</ref>

== Pharmacology ==
Ropinirole acts as a [[Dopamine receptor D2|D<sub>2</sub>]], [[Dopamine receptor D3|D<sub>3</sub>]], and [[Dopamine receptor D4|D<sub>4</sub>]] [[dopamine]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] [[agonist]] with highest [[Chemical affinity|affinity]] for D<sub>2</sub>. It is weakly active at the [[5-HT2 receptor|5-HT<sub>2</sub>]], and [[alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>2</sub>]] receptors and is said to have virtually no affinity for the [[5-HT1 receptor|5-HT<sub>1</sub>]], [[GABA receptor|GABA]], [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor|mAChRs]], [[alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>]], and [[Beta adrenergic receptor#.CE.B2 receptors|β-adrenoreceptors]].<ref name="RopPharmacology">{{cite journal | author=Eden, R.

Ropinirole is metabolized primarily by [[cytochrome P450]] [[CYP1A2]] to form two [[metabolites]]; SK&F-104557 and SK&F-89124, both of which are renally excreted,<ref name="RPL">[http://www.richmondpharmacology.com/downloads/Publications/L3%20MDS%20ESRD%20poster.pdf An open-label, parallel-group, repeat-dose study to investigate the effects of end-stage renal disease and haemodialysis on the pharmacokinetics of ropinirole] | Authors: Debra J.

At doses greater than 24&nbsp;mg, [[CYP2D6]] may be inhibited, although this has only been tested [[in vitro]].<ref name=TompsonD/>

== Side effects ==
Ropinirole can cause nausea, dizziness, hallucinations, [[orthostatic hypotension]], and sudden sleep attacks during the daytime. Unusual side effects specific to D<sub>3</sub> agonists such as ropinirole and [[pramipexole]] can include [[hypersexuality]], [[punding]] and [[compulsive gambling]], even in patients without a history of these behaviours.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.4065/84.4.310 |vauthors=Bostwick JM, Hecksel KA, Stevens SR, Bower JH, Ahlskog JE | title= Frequency of new-onset pathologic compulsive gambling or hypersexuality after drug treatment of idiopathic Parkinson disease |journal=Mayo Clinic Proceedings| volume=84 |issue=4 |pages=310–6 | year=2009 | pmid= 19339647 | pmc=2665974 }}</ref>

==Lawsuits==
In November 2012, [[GlaxoSmithKline]] was ordered by a [[Rennes]] appeals court to pay Frenchman Didier Jambart 197,000 euros ($255,824); Jambart had taken ropinirole from 2003 to 2010 and exhibited risky hypersexual behavior and gambled excessively until stopping the Parkinson's treatment.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/29/didier-jambart-parkinsons-drug-gay-sex-addict-glaxosmithkline_n_2212348.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Curtis | last=Wong | title=Court Rules Parkinson's Drug Turned Straight Patient Into A Gay Sex Addict | date=2012-11-29}}</ref>
