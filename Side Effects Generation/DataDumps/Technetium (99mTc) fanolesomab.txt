'''Technetium (<sup>99m</sup>Tc) fanolesomab''' (trade name '''NeutroSpec''', manufactured by Palatin Technologies) is a [[mouse]] [[monoclonal antibody]] formerly used to aid in the diagnosis of [[appendicitis]]. It is [[isotopic labeling|labeled]] with a [[radioisotope]], [[technetium-99m]] (<sup>99m</sup>Tc).

==History and use==
NeutroSpec was approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in June 2004 for imaging of patients with symptoms of appendicitis.  It consisted of an intact murine (mouse) IgM monoclonal antibody against human [[CD15]], labeled with technetium-99m so as to be visible on a [[gamma camera]] image.  Since anti-CD15 antibodies bind selectively to white blood cells such as [[neutrophils]], it could be used to localize the site of an infection.

==Deaths and associated recall==
The FDA received reports from Palatin of 2 deaths and 15 life-threatening [[adverse drug reaction|adverse events]] in patients who had received NeutroSpec.

<blockquote>
These events occurred within minutes of administration of NeutroSpec and included [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]], [[hypotension|low blood pressure]], and [[cardiac arrest|cardiopulmonary arrest]]. Affected patients required resuscitation with intravenous fluids, blood pressure support, and oxygen. Most, but not all, of the patients who experienced these events had existing cardiac and/or pulmonary conditions that may have placed them at higher risk for these adverse events. A review of all [[postmarketing surveillance|post-marketing reports]] showed an additional 46 patients who experienced adverse events that were similar but less severe. All of the reactions occurred immediately after NeutroSpec was administered.<ref>{{cite press release | url = http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/advisory/technetium99.htm | title = FDA Public Health Advisory: Suspended Marketing of NeutroSpec (Technetium (99m Tc) fanolesomab) | date = December 19, 2005 | accessdate = 2007-11-27 | publisher = U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]]}}</ref>

Marketing of the product was suspended in December 2005.
