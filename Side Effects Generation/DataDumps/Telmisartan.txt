'''Telmisartan''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) {{IPAc-en|t|ɛ|l|m|ɪ|ˈ|s|ɑr|t|ən}} is an [[angiotensin II receptor antagonist]] (angiotensin receptor blocker, ARB) used in the management of [[hypertension]]. It was discovered by [[Boehringer Ingelheim]] and launched in 1999 as '''Micardis'''.<ref>[http://www.boehringer-ingelheim.com/corporate_profile/history/history3.html History of Boehringer Ingelheim] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.boehringer-ingelheim.com/corporate_profile/history/history3.html |date=* }}</ref>

In January 2014, Actavis as generic version of Micardis got appoval from [[FDA]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://newdrugapprovals.org/2014/01/09/telmisartan-actavis-generic-version-of-micardis-receives-fda-approval/ |title=TELMISARTAN ..Actavis’ Generic Version of Micardis Receives FDA Approval |accessdate=September 28, 2016}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
Telmisartan is indicated in the treatment of [[essential hypertension]].<ref name="Pritor prescribing information">Pritor prescribing information</ref><ref name="Drugs.com-pro">Drugs.com: [http://www.drugs.com/monograph/telmisartan.html Telmisartan]</ref>

==Contraindications==
Telmisartan is contraindicated during [[pregnancy]]. Like other drugs affecting the [[renin-angiotensin system]] (RAS), telmisartan can cause [[birth defect]]s, [[stillbirth]]s, and [[neonatal death]]s. It is not known whether the drug passes into the breast milk.<ref name="Drugs.com">Drugs.com: [http://www.drugs.com/micardis.html Micardis]</ref> Also it is contraindicated in bilateral [[renal artery stenosis]] in which it can cause renal failure.

==Side effects==
Side effects are similar to other angiotensin II receptor antagonists and include [[tachycardia]] and [[bradycardia]] (fast or slow heartbeat), [[hypotension]] (low blood pressure), [[edema]] (swelling of arms, legs, lips, tongue, or throat, the latter leading to breathing problems), and [[allergic reaction]]s.<ref name="Drugs.com" />

==Interactions==
Due to its mechanism of action, telmisartan increases blood [[potassium]] levels. Combination with potassium preparations or [[potassium-sparing diuretic]]s could cause [[hyperkalaemia]] (excessive potassium levels). Combination with [[NSAIDs]], especially in patients with impaired kidney function, has a risk of causing (usually reversible) [[kidney failure]].<ref name="AC">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2015|language=German}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
Telmisartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker that shows high affinity for the [[angiotensin II receptor type 1]] (AT<sub>1</sub>), with a binding affinity 3000 times greater for AT<sub>1</sub> than [[Angiotensin II receptor type 2|AT<sub>2</sub>]].

In addition to blocking the RAS, telmisartan acts as a selective modulator of [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma]] (PPAR-γ), a central regulator of [[insulin]] and [[glucose]] metabolism. It is believed that telmisartan’s dual mode of action may provide protective benefits against the vascular and renal damage caused by [[diabetes]] and [[cardiovascular disease]] (CVD).<ref name="Benson SC 1002"/>

Telmisartan's activity at the [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta]] (PPAR-δ) receptor has prompted speculation around its potential as a sport doping agent as an alternative to [[GW 501516]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Sanchis-Gomar | first1 = F. | last2 = Lippi | first2 = G. | doi = 10.1519/JSC.0b013e31824301b6 | title = Telmisartan as metabolic modulator: A new perspective in sports doping? | journal = Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research | pages = 1 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22130396| pmc = | volume=26 | issue=3}}</ref> Telmisartan activates PPAR-δ receptors in several tissues.<ref>{{cite book|title=Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Receptors: Advances in Research and Application: 2011 Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9qCMLa1sIN0C&pg=PA21|accessdate=2 April 2013|year=2012|publisher=ScholarlyEditions|isbn=978-1-464-93110-9|pages=21–}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal

===Pharmacokinetics===
The substance is quickly but to varying degrees absorbed from the gut. The average [[bioavailability]] is about 50% (42–100%). Food intake has no clinically relevant influence on the kinetics of telmisartan. [[Plasma protein binding]] is over 99.5%, mainly to [[albumin]] and [[alpha-1-acid glycoprotein]].<ref name="AC" /> It has the longest half-life of any ARB (24 hours)<ref name="Pritor prescribing information"/><ref name="Benson SC 1002">{{Cite journal

The study aimed to investigate the role of telmisartan in [[cardiovascular]] (CV) protection through the primary composite outcome of death from CV causes, [[myocardial infarction]], [[stroke]] or hospitalization for [[heart failure]], in high CV risk patients.

The study showed telmisartan was as effective as ramipril but with lower rates of [[cough]] and [[angioedema]], which led to fewer discontinuations. The combination group experienced similar efficacy, but with increased risk of [[hypotensive]] symptoms. Moreover, in a patient population selected to tolerate ACE inhibitors, telmisartan was shown to be better tolerated and associated with higher treatment compliance than ramipril.<ref>Bayer Healthcare: [http://www.ICMAedu.com Telmisartan approved by the European Commission to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity in a broad spectrum of at risk patients]</ref>

===TRANSCEND===
As part of the ONTARGET study, patients who could not tolerate ACE inhibitors were randomly assigned to receive either telmisartan or [[placebo]] as part of the Telmisartan Randomized Assessment Study in ACE Intolerant Subjects with Cardiovascular Disease (TRANSCEND) study. An accompanying editorial comments: "Overall, data supporting use of angiotensin-receptor blockers to prevent vascular events in various cardiovascular groups, other than heart failure, are incomplete. TRANSCEND's results challenge the non-inferiority shown in ONTARGET and suggest no more than a modest effect, if any at all."<ref>{{Cite journal
