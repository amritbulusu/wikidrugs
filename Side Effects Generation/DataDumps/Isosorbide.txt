'''Isosorbide''' is a [[heterocyclic compound]] that is derived from [[glucose]]. Isosorbide and its two [[isomer]]s, namely [[isoidide]] and [[isomannide]], are  1,4:3,6-[[dianhydrohexitol]]s.
It is a white solid that is prepared from the double [[dehydration reaction|dehydration]] of [[sorbitol]].   Isosorbide is a non-toxic [[diol]] produced from biobased feedstocks, that is biodegradable and thermally stable.  It is used in medicine and has been touted as a potential biofeedstock.

==Production==
[[Hydrogenation]] of glucose gives [[sorbitol]]. Isosorbide is obtained by double [[dehydration reaction|dehydration]] of sorbitol:
:(CHOH)<sub>4</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>OH)<sub>2</sub>    →    C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>  +  2 H<sub>2</sub>O

An intermediate in the dehydration is the monocycle [[sorbitan]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = M. Rose, R.

==Application==
Isosorbide is used as a [[diuretic]], mainly to treat [[hydrocephalus]], and is also used to treat [[glaucoma]].<ref>{{pubChem|12597}}</ref>
Other medications are derived from isosorbide, including [[isosorbide dinitrate]] and [[isosorbide mononitrate]], are used to treat [[angina pectoris]].  Other isosorbide-based medicines are used as osmotic [[diuretic]]s and for treatment of esophageal varices.  Like other [[nitric oxide]] donors (see [[biological functions of nitric oxide]]), these drugs lower portal pressure by [[vasodilation]] and decreasing cardiac output. Isosorbide dinitrate and [[hydralazine]] are the two components of the anti-hypertensive drug [[isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine]] (Bidil).

Isosorbide is also used as a building block for bio based polymers such as [[polyester]]s.<ref>{{cite journal| doi = 10.1002/macp.201100146| title = Efficiency Increase of Poly (ethylene terephthalate‐co‐isosorbide terephthalate) Synthesis using Bimetallic Catalytic Systems | year= 2011 | author1 = Bersot J.C.| journal = Macromol.
