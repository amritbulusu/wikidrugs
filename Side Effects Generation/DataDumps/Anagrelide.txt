'''Anagrelide''' (Agrylin/Xagrid, [[Shire Pharmaceuticals Group|Shire]] and Thromboreductin, [[AOP Orphan Pharmaceuticals AG]]) is a drug used for the treatment of [[essential thrombocytosis]] (ET; essential thrombocythemia), or overproduction of blood platelets. It also has been used in the treatment of [[chronic myeloid leukemia]].<ref name="pmid17091608">{{cite journal |vauthors=Voglová J, Maisnar V, Beránek M, Chrobák L |title=[Combination of imatinib and anagrelide in treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in blastic phase] |language=Czech |journal=Vnitr̆ní lékar̆ství |volume=52 |issue=9 |pages=819–22 |year=2006 |pmid=17091608 |doi=}}</ref>

According to a 2005 [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] randomized trial, the combination of [[hydroxyurea]] with [[aspirin]] is superior to the combination of anagrelide and [[aspirin]] for the initial management of ET.  The [[hydroxyurea]] arm had a lower likelihood of [[myelofibrosis]], [[arterial]] [[thrombosis]], and [[bleeding]], but it had a slightly higher rate of [[venous thrombosis]].<ref name="HarrisonCN2" />  Anagrelide can be useful in times when hydroxyurea proves ineffective.

== Side-effects ==
Common [[adverse drug reaction|side effects]] are headache, diarrhea, unusual weakness/fatigue, hair loss, nausea and dizziness.

The same MRC trial mentioned above also analyzed the effects of anagrelide on bone marrow fibrosis, a common feature in patients with myelofibrosis. The use of anagrelide was associated with a rapid increase in the degree of reticulin deposition (the mechanism by which fibrosis occurs), when compared to those in whom hydroxyurea was used. Patients with myeloproliferative conditions are known to have a very slow and somewhat variable course of marrow fibrosis increase. This trend may be accelerated by anagrelide. Interestingly, this increase in fibrosis appeared to be linked to a drop in hemoglobin as it progressed. Fortunately, stopping the drug (and switching patients to hydroxyurea) appeared to reverse the degree of marrow fibrosis. Thus, patients on anagrelide may need to be monitored on a periodic basis for marrow reticulin scores, especially if anemia develops, or becomes more pronounced if present initially.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Campbell PJ, Bareford D, Erber WN |title=Reticulin accumulation in essential thrombocythemia: prognostic significance and relationship to therapy |journal=J. Clin. Oncol. |volume=27 |issue=18 |pages=2991–9 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19364963|doi=10.1200/JCO.2008.20.3174 |url=http://www.jco.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=19364963 |pmc=3398138|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

Less common side effects include: congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, cardiomegaly, complete heart block, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, pericarditis, pulmonary infiltrates, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, pancreatitis, gastric/duodenal ulceration, renal impairment/failure and seizure.

Due to these issues, anagrelide should not generally be considered for first line therapy in ET.
== Mechanism of action ==
Anagrelide works by inhibiting the maturation of [[platelets]] from [[megakaryocytes]].<ref name="pmid16810615">{{cite journal |author =Petrides PE |title=Anagrelide: what was new in 2004 and 2005? |journal=Semin.

Condensation of benzyl chloride '''1''' with ethyl ester of glycine gives alkylated product '''2'''. Reduction of the nitro group leads to the aniline and reaction of this with [[cyanogen bromide]] possibly gives cyanamide '''3''' as the initial intermediate. Addition of the aliphatic would then lead to formation of the [[quinazoline]] ring ('''4'''). Amide formation between the newly formed imide and the ester would then serve to form the imidazolone ring, whatever the details of the sequence, there is obtained anagrelide ('''5''').
