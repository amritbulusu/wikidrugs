'''Stanozolol''', sold under many brand names,<ref name="Drugs.com"/> is a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]] [[anabolic-androgenic steroid]] (AAS) which was derived from [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT).<ref name="IndexNominum2000" /> It was developed by American pharmaceutical company [[Winthrop Laboratories]] (Sterling Drug) in 1962, and has been approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] for human use, though it is no longer marketed in this country.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Drugs@FDA: FDA Approved Drug Products|url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.DrugDetails|website = www.accessdata.fda.gov|access-date = 2016-02-18}}</ref>

Unlike most injectable AAS, stanozolol is not [[ester]]ified and is sold as an [[aqueous solution|aqueous]] suspension, or in oral tablet form. The drug has a high oral [[bioavailability]], due to a C17α-alkylation which allows the hormone to survive first-pass [[liver]] metabolism when ingested. It is because of this that stanozolol is also sold in [[tablet (pharmacy)|tablet]] form.

Stanozolol is one of the AAS commonly used as [[performance-enhancing drug]]s and is banned from use in sports competition under the auspices of the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF) and many other sporting bodies.  Additionally, stanozolol has been used in US [[horse racing]].<ref>[http://www.slate.com/id/2217357/ Win, Place, and Dope] ''Slate'', May 1, 2009</ref>

==Medical uses==
Stanozolol has been used in both animals and human patients for a number of conditions. In humans, it has been demonstrated to be successful in treating [[anaemia]] and [[angioedema|hereditary angioedema]], the latter of which it has been specifically approved for the treatment of in some countries.<ref name="MangusMiller2005">{{cite book|author1=Brent C Mangus|author2=Michael G Miller|title=Pharmacology Application in Athletic Training|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tV72AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA151|date=11 January 2005|publisher=F.A. Davis|isbn=978-0-8036-2027-8|pages=151–}}</ref> [[Veterinarian]]s may prescribe the drug to improve muscle growth, red blood cell production, increase bone density and stimulate the appetite of debilitated or weakened animals.

==Non-medical use==

===Bodybuilding===
Stanozolol is subject to non-medically supervised off-label use by some athletes for its anabolic properties frequently presenting with concomitant reduction of body fat. Stanozolol is a modified derivative of DHT and thus not aromatized to oestrogens via the aromatase class of enzymes (see chemical structure to right). Bodybuilders frequently misuse the term "dry" in describing their joint pain while using stanozolol either orally or via IM injection of an aqueous suspension; a reference to their perceived reason for an increase in joint pain. Rather, stanozolol as a DHT derivative can selectively compete with progesterone and other natural and synthetic progestins (nandrolone) for progestin receptors; yielding a reduction in progesterone mediated anti-inflammatory processes and presenting patients with a perception of increased joint discomfort.

Stanozolol is used by athletes and [[bodybuilders]] to lose fat while retaining lean body mass.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} It is usually used in a "cutting or leaning out" cycle, to help preserve lean body mass while metabolizing [[adipose]],{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} although it has not been proven conclusively that it has any special fat-burning properties.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Stanozolol (PIM 918)|url = http://www.inchem.org/documents/pims/pharm/pim918.htm#PartTitle:4.|website = www.inchem.org|access-date = 2016-02-18}}</ref>

==Side effects==
{{See also|Anabolic steroid#Adverse effects}}

==Pharmacology==
As an AAS, stanozolol is an [[agonist]] of the [[androgen receptor]] (AR), similarly to [[androgen]]s like [[testosterone]] and DHT.<ref name="Llewellyn2011">{{cite book|author=William Llewellyn|title=Anabolics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=afKLA-6wW0oC&pg=PT434|year=2011|publisher=Molecular Nutrition Llc|isbn=978-0-9828280-1-4|pages=434–}}</ref><ref name="Kicman2008">{{cite journal |last1=Kicman |first1=A T |title=Pharmacology of anabolic steroids |journal=British Journal of Pharmacology |volume=154 |issue=3 |year=2008 |pages=502–521 |doi=10.1038/bjp.2008.165|pmid=18500378 |pmc=2439524}}</ref> It is not a [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] for [[5α-reductase]] as it is already 5α-reduced, and so is not potentiated in so-called "androgenic" tissues like the [[skin]], [[hair follicle]]s, and [[prostate gland]].<ref name="Llewellyn2011" /><ref name="Kicman2008" /> This results in a greater ratio of [[anabolic]] to [[androgenic]] activity compared to [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]].<ref name="Llewellyn2011" /><ref name="Kicman2008" /> In addition, due to its 5α-reduced nature, stanozolol is non-[[aromatase|aromatizable]], and hence has no propensity for producing [[estrogenic]] effects such as [[gynecomastia]] or [[water retention (medicine)|fluid retention]].<ref name="Llewellyn2011" /><ref name="Kicman2008" /> Stanozolol also does not possess any [[progestogen]]ic activity of significance.<ref name="Llewellyn2011" /><ref name="Kicman2008" /> Because of the presence of its 17α-methyl group, the [[metabolism]] of stanozolol is [[steric hindrance|sterically hindered]], resulting in it being [[oral administration|orally active]], although also [[hepatotoxicity|hepatotoxic]].<ref name="Llewellyn2011" /><ref name="Kicman2008" />

===Detection in body fluids===
Stanozolol is subject to extensive hepatic biotransformation by a variety of enzymatic pathways. The primary  metabolites are unique to stanozolol and are detectable in the urine for up to 10 days after a single 5–10&nbsp;mg oral dose. Methods for detection in urine specimens usually involve gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mateus-Avois L, Mangin P, Saugy M |title=Use of ion trap gas chromatography-multiple mass spectrometry for the detection and confirmation of 3'hydroxystanozolol at trace levels in urine for doping control |journal=Journal of Chromatography B |volume=816 |issue=1-2 |pages=193–201 |year=2005 |pmid=15664350 |doi=10.1016/j.jchromb.2004.11.033 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Pozo OJ, Van Eenoo P, Deventer K, Lootens L, Grimalt S, Sancho JV, Hernández F, Meuleman P, Leroux-Roels G, Delbeke FT |title=Detection and structural investigation of metabolites of stanozolol in human urine by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry |journal=Steroids |volume=74 |issue=10-11 |pages=837–52 |year=2009 |pmid=19464304 |doi=10.1016/j.steroids.2009.05.004 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=R. |last=Baselt |title=Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man |edition=8th |publisher=Biomedical Publications |location=Foster City, CA |year=2008 |pages=1442–3 }}</ref>

==History==
In 1962, Stanozolol was brought to market in the US by [[Sterling Drug|Winthrop]] under the tradename "Winstrol" and in Europe by Winthrop's partner, [[Bayer]], under the name "Stromba".<ref>Levin J, Trafford JA, Bishop PM.  Stanozolol, a new anabolic steroid. J New Drugs. 1962 Jan-Feb;2:50-5. {{PMID|14464563}}</ref>

Also in 1962, the [[Kefauver Harris Amendment]] was passed, amending the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] to require drug manufacturers to provide proof of the effectiveness of their drugs before approval.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/CentennialofFDA/CentennialEditionofFDAConsumer/ucm093787.htm |title=Promoting Safe and Effective Drugs for 100 Years |work=The Kefauver-Harris Drug Amendments |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration }}</ref> The FDA implemented its [[Drug Efficacy Study Implementation]] (DESI) program to study and regulate drugs, including stanozolol, that had been introduced prior to the amendment.  The DESI program was intended to classify all pre-1962 drugs that were already on the market as effective, ineffective, or needing further study.<ref>Pharmacy Today. August 2008.  [http://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/enforcementactivitiesbyfda/selectedenforcementactionsonunapproveddrugs/ucm119899.pdf FDA aims to remove unapproved drugs from market: Risk-based enforcement program focuses on  removing potentially harmful products]</ref>  The FDA enlisted the [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] to evaluate publications on relevant drugs under the DESI program.<ref>National Academies of Sciences archives.  [http://www.nasonline.org/about-nas/history/archives/collections/des-1966-1969-1.html The Drug Efficacy Study of the National Research Council’s Division of Medical Sciences, 1966-1969]</ref>

In June 1970 the FDA announced its conclusions on the effectiveness of certain AAS, including stanozolol, based on the NAS/NRC reports made under DESI. The drugs were classified as probably effective as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of senile and postmenopausal [[osteoporosis]] but only as an adjunct, and in [[pituitary dwarfism]] (with a specific caveat for dwarfism, "until growth hormone is more available"), and as lacking substantial evidence of effectiveness for several other indications.  Specifically, the FDA found a lack of efficacy for stanozolol as "an adjunct to promote body tissue-building processes and to reverse tissue-depleting processes in such conditions as malignant diseases and chronic nonmalignant diseases; debility in elderly patients, and other emaciating diseases; gastrointestinal disorders resulting in alterations of normal metabolism; use during pre-operative and postoperative periods in undernourished patients and poor-risk surgical cases due to traumatism; use in infants, children, and adolescents who do not reach an adequate weight; supportive treatment to help restore or  maintain a favorable metabolic balance,  as in postsurgical, postinfectious, and convalescent patients; of value in pre- operative patients who have lost tissue  from a disease process or who have associated symptoms, such as anorexia;  retention and utilization of calcium; surgical applications; gastrointestinal disease, malnourished adults, and chronic  illness; pediatric nutritional problems; prostatic carcinoma; and endocrine deficiencies."<ref name=FedReg1970>Food and Drug Administration Notice. "DESI 7630. Certain Anabolic Steroids.  Drugs for Human Use:  Drug Efficacy Study Implementation" [https://archive.org/details/federalregister35cunit Federal Register Vol 35, No. 122. June 24, 1970].  page 10327–28</ref>  The FDA gave Sterling six months to stop marketing stanozolol for the indications for which there was no evidence for efficacy, and one year to submit further data for the two indications for which it found probable efficacy.<ref name=FedReg1970/>

In August and September 1970, Sterling submitted more data; the data was not sufficient but the FDA allowed the drug to be continued to be marketed, since there was an unmet need for drugs for osteoporosis and pituitary dwarfism, but Sterling was required to submit more data.<ref name=FedReg1984>Food and Drug Administration Notice.

In 1980 the FDA removed the dwarfism indication from the label for stanozolol since [[human growth hormone]] drugs had come on the market, and mandated that the label for stanozolol and other steroids say: "As adjunctive therapy in senile and postmenopausal osteoporosis. AAS are without value as primary therapy but may be of value as adjunctive therapy. Equal or greater consideration should be given to diet, calcium balance, physiotherapy, and good general health promoting measures." and gave Sterling a timeline to submit further data for other indications it wanted for the drug.<ref name=FedReg1980>Food and Drug Administration Notice.

The FDA's Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee considered the data submitted for osteoporosis in two meetings held 1981 and the data for [[aplastic anemia]] in 1983.<ref name=FedReg1984/>

In April 1984, the FDA announced that the data was not sufficient, and withdrew the marketing authority for stanozolol for senile and postmenopausal osteoporosis and for raising hemoglobin levels in aplastic anemia.<ref name=FedReg1984/><ref>The Pink Sheet 30 April 1984 [https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet/46/018/sterling-winstrol-stanozolol-nda-withdrawal-process-beginning-fda Sterling Winstrol (Stanozolol) NDA Withdrawal Process Beginning, FDA]</ref>

It is used in veterinary medicine as an adjunct in the management of wasting diseases, to stimulate the [[erythropoeisis|formation of red blood cells]], arouse appetite, and promote weight gain, but the evidence for these uses is weak.  It is used as a performance-enhancing drug in race horses.  Its side effects include weight gain, water retention, and [[azotemia|difficulty eliminating nitrogen-based waste products]] and it is toxic to the liver, especially in cats. Because it may promote the growth of tumors, it is contraindicated in dogs with enlarged prostates.<ref>Jim E. Riviere, Mark G. Papich. ''Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics''.

===Regulation===
{{Globalize/US|date=January 2012}}

In the [[United States]], like other AAS, stanozolol is classified as a [[controlled substance]] under federal regulation; they were included as Schedule III controlled substances under the Anabolic Steroids Act, which was passed as part of the [[Crime Control Act of 1990]].<ref>Steven B. Karch.  Pathology, Toxicogenetics, and Criminalistics of Drug Abuse. CRC Press, 2007 {{ISBN|9781420054569}}</ref>{{rp|30}} In New York, the state legislature classifies AAS under DEA [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule III controlled substances|Schedule III]].

Stanozolol and other synthetic steroids were first banned by the [[International Olympic Committee]] and the [[International Amateur Athletic Federation]] in 1974, after methods to detect them had been developed.<ref>Shänzer, W.
