'''Azaperone''' is a [[pyridinylpiperazine]] and [[butyrophenone]] [[neuroleptic]] [[drug]] with [[sedative]] and [[antiemetic]] effects, which is used mainly as a [[tranquilizer]] in [[veterinary]] medicine. It is uncommonly used in humans as an [[antipsychotic]] drug. 

Azaperone acts primarily as a [[dopamine]] [[antagonist (pharmacology)|antagonist]] but also has some [[histamine|antihistaminic]] and [[choline|anticholinergic]] properties as seen with similar drugs such as [[haloperidol]]. Azaperone may cause [[hypotension]] and while it has minimal effects on respiration in pigs, high doses in humans can cause [[respiratory depression]]. 

== Veterinary use ==

The most common use for azaperone is in relatively small doses to reduce aggression in farmed pigs, either to stop them fighting or to encourage sows to accept piglets. Higher doses are used for [[anesthesia]] in combination with other drugs such as [[xylazine]], [[tiletamine]] and [[zolazepam]]. Azaperone is also used in combination with strong narcotics such as [[etorphine]] or [[carfentanil]] for tranquilizing large animals such as elephants.<ref>[http://www.elephantcare.org/Drugs/azaperon.htm The Elephant Formulary]</ref> Use in horses is avoided as adverse reactions may occur.

The [[European Medicines Agency]] has established a [[maximum residue limit]] for azaperone when administered to pigs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Azaperone Summary Report (2)|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Maximum_Residue_Limits_-_Report/2009/11/WC500010786.pdf|website=European Medicines Agency|publisher=Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products|accessdate=2017-01-15|date=November 1997}}</ref>

Azaperone (under the brand name Stresnil) was approved for use in pigs in the USA in 1983, under NADA 115-732.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Rules and Regulations|journal=Federal Register|date=18 October 1983|volume=48|issue=202|page=48229|url=http://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/fedreg/fr048/fr048202/fr048202.pdf|accessdate=2017-01-15}}</ref>
