'''Topiramate''' (brand name '''Topamax''') is an [[anticonvulsant]] (antiepilepsy) drug. In late 2012, topiramate was approved by the [[FDA|United States Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) [[phentermine/topiramate|in combination]] with [[phentermine]] for weight loss. The drug had previously been used [[Off-label use|off-label]] for this purpose. Topiramate was originally produced by [[Ortho-McNeil Neurologics]] and Noramco, Inc., both divisions of the [[Johnson & Johnson]] Corporation. This medication was discovered in 1979 by [[Bruce E. Maryanoff]] and Joseph F. Gardocki during their research work at [[McNeil Pharmaceuticals]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Maryanoff |first1=BE |last2=Nortey |first2=SO |last3=Gardocki |first3=JF |last4=Shank |first4=RP |last5=Dodgson |first5=SP |title=Anticonvulsant O-alkyl sulfamates. 2,3:4,5-Bis-O-(1-methylethylidene)-beta-D-fructopyranose sulfamate and related compounds |journal=Journal of Medicinal Chemistry |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=880–7 |year=1987 |pmid=3572976 |doi=10.1021/jm00388a023}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Maryanoff |first1=BE |last2=Costanzo |first2=MJ |last3=Nortey |first3=SO |last4=Greco |first4=MN |last5=Shank |first5=RP |last6=Schupsky |first6=JJ |last7=Ortegon |first7=MP |last8=Vaught |first8=JL |title=Structure-activity studies on anticonvulsant sugar sulfamates related to topiramate.

==Warnings and contraindications==
People taking topiramate should be aware of the following risks: 
*Avoid activities requiring mental alertness and coordination until drug effects are realized.
*Topiramate may impair heat regulation,<ref name="side-effects" /> especially in children. Use caution with activities leading to an increased core temperature, such as strenuous exercise, exposure to extreme heat, or dehydration.
*Topiramate may cause visual field defects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/ucm195797.htm|title=Topamax (topiramate) tablets and sprinkle capsules|publisher=Fda.gov|accessdate=17 October 2014}}</ref>
*Topiramate may decrease effectiveness of oestrogen-containing oral contraceptives.
*Taking topiramate in the 1st trimester of pregnancy may increase risk of cleft lip/cleft palate in infant.<ref name="fda.gov"/>
*As is the case for all antiepileptic drugs, it is advisable not to suddenly discontinue topiramate as there is a theoretical risk of rebound seizures.

==Interactions==
Topiramate has many drug-drug interactions. Some of the most common are listed below:
* As topiramate inhibits [[carbonic anhydrase]], use with other inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase (e.g. [[acetazolamide]]) increases the risk of [[kidney stones]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
* [[Enzyme inducer]]s (e.g. [[carbamazepine]]) can increase the elimination of topiramate, possibly necessitating dose escalations of topiramate.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
* Topiramate may increase the plasma-levels of phenytoin.
* Topiramate itself is a weak inhibitor of [[CYP2C19]] and induces [[CYP3A4]]; a decrease in plasma levels of estrogens and [[digoxin]] has been noted during topiramate therapy. This can reduce the effectiveness of [[combined oral contraceptive pill|oral contraceptives]] (birth control  pills); use of alternative birth control methods is recommended.<ref name=Martindale_OC>{{cite book|editor=Sweetman, Sean C. |chapter=Sex hormones and their modulators|title=[[Martindale: The complete drug reference]] |edition=36th |year=2009 |page=2068 |publisher=Pharmaceutical Press |location=London|isbn=978-0-85369-840-1}}</ref> Neither [[intrauterine device]]s (IUDs) nor [[Depo-Provera]] are affected by topiramate.<ref name=Martindale_OC/>
* Alcohol may cause increased sedation or drowsiness, and increase the risk of having a seizure.
* As listed in the 06/29/2005 label posted at the Drugs@FDA website page 14,'conditions or therapies that predispose to acidosis may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of Topiramate'.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2005/020505s018lbl.pdf FDA.gov]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205092259/http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2005/020505s018lbl.pdf |date=February 5, 2007 }}</ref>
* [[Anhidrosis|Oligohidrosis]] and hyperthermia were reported in post-marketing reports about topiramate; [[antimuscarinic]] drugs (like trospium) can aggravate these disorders.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Pharmacology==
Chemically, topiramate is a [[sulfamic acid|sulfamate]]-substituted [[monosaccharide]], related to [[fructose]], a rather unusual chemical structure for an anticonvulsant.

Topiramate is quickly absorbed after oral use. Most of the drug (70%) is excreted in the urine unchanged. The remainder is extensively metabolized by [[hydroxylation]], [[hydrolysis]], and [[glucuronidation]]. Six [[metabolite]]s have been identified in humans, none of which constitutes more than 5% of an administered dose.

Several cellular targets have been proposed to be relevant to the therapeutic activity of topiramate.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Porter RJ, Dhir A, Macdonald RL, Rogawski MA |chapter= Mechanisms of action of antiseizure drugs | title= Handb Clin Neurol | year= 2012 | volume = 108 | pages = 663–681 | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-444-52899-5.00021-6 |url = http://works.bepress.com/michael_rogawski/41/ }}</ref> These include (1) voltage-gated [[sodium channels]]; (2) high-voltage-activated [[calcium channels]]; (3) [[GABA-A receptor]]s; (4) AMPA/kainate receptors; and (5) [[carbonic anhydrase]] isoenzymes. There is evidence that topiramate may alter the activity of its targets by modifying their phosphorylation state instead of by a direct action.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Meldrum BS, Rogawski MA | title= Molecular targets for antiepileptic drug development |journal=Neurotherapeutics |year=2007 | volume=4 | issue =1 |pages= 18–61 |pmid= 17199015 |pmc= 1852436 | doi=10.1016/j.nurt.2006.11.010}}</ref> The effect on sodium channels could be of particular relevance for seizure protection. Although topiramate does inhibit high-voltage-activated calcium channels, the relevance to clinical activity is uncertain. Effects on specific GABA-A receptor isoforms could also contribute to the antiseizure activity of the drug. Topiramate selectively inhibits cytosolic (type II) and membrane associated (type IV) forms of carbonic anhydrase. The action on carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes may contribute to the drug’s side-effects, including its propensity to cause metabolic acidosis and calcium phosphate kidney stones.

Topiramate inhibits maximal electroshock and [[pentylenetetrazol]]-induced seizures as well as partial and secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures in the kindling model, findings predictive of a broad spectrum of activities clinically. Its action on [[mitochondrial permeability transition]] pores has been proposed as a mechanism.<ref name="pmid15571505">{{cite journal |last1=Kudin |first1=AP|last2=Debska-Vielhaber |first2=G |last3=Vielhaber |first3=S |last4=Elger |first4=CE |last5=Kunz |first5=WS |title=The mechanism of neuroprotection by topiramate in an animal model of epilepsy |journal=Epilepsia |volume=45 |issue=12 |pages=1478–87 |year=2004|pmid=15571505 |doi=10.1111/j.0013-9580.2004.13504.x}}</ref>

While many [[anticonvulsants]] have been associated with [[apoptosis]] in young animals, animal experiments have found that topiramate is one of the very few anticonvulsants [see: levetiracetam, carbamazepine, lamotrigine] that do not induce apoptosis in young animals at doses needed to produce an anticonvulsant effect.<ref name="Czuczwar-2004">{{cite journal |last1=Czuczwar |first1=K |last2=Czuczwar |first2=M |last3=Cieszczyk |first3=J|last4=Gawlik |first4=P |last5=Luszczki |first5=JJ |last6=Borowicz |first6=KK |last7=Czuczwar |first7=SJ |title=Neuroprotective activity of antiepileptic drugs |journal=Przeglad lekarski |volume=61 |issue=11 |pages=1268–71 |year=2004 |pmid=15727029}}</ref>

===Detection in body fluids===
Blood, serum or plasma topiramate concentrations may be measured using immunoassay or chromatographic methods to monitor therapy, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Plasma levels are usually less than 10&nbsp;mg/L during therapeutic administration, but can range from 10–150&nbsp;mg/L in overdose victims.<ref>Goswami D, Kumar A, Khuroo AH, et al.
