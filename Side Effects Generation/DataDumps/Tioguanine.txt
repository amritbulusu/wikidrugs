===Hepatic veno-occlusive disease===

The major concern that has inhibited the use of thioguanine has been veno-occlusive disease (VOD) and its histological precursor nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH).

==Interactions==
Cancers that do not respond to treatment with mercaptopurine do not respond to thioguanine. On the other hand, some cases of IBD that are resistant to mercaptopurine (or its pro-drug azathioprine) may be responsive to thioguanine.

==Pharmacogenetics==
The enzyme [[thiopurine S-methyltransferase]] (TPMT) is responsible for the direct inactivation of thioguanine to its methylthioguanine base – this [[methylation]] prevents thioguanine from further conversion into active, [[cytotoxic]] thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) metabolites.<ref name="pmid21270794">{{cite journal | author=Relling MV, Gardner EE, Sandborn WJ, Schmiegelow K, Pui CH, Yee SW, Stein CM, Carrillo M, Evans WE, Klein TE; Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guidelines for thiopurine methyltransferase genotype and thiopurine dosing| journal=Clin Pharmacol Ther | volume=89 | issue=3 | pages=387–91 |date=March 2011 | pmid=21270794| PMC=3098761 | doi=10.1038/clpt.2010.320}}</ref><ref name="pmid19952870">{{cite journal |vauthors=Zaza G, Cheok M, Krynetskaia N, Thorn C, Stocco G, Hebert JM, McLeod H, Weinshilboum RM, Relling MV, Evans WE, Klein TE, Altman RB | title=Thiopurine pathway | journal=Pharmcogenet Genomics | volume=20 | issue=9 | pages=573–4 |date=September 2010 | pmid=19952870 | doi=10.1097/FPC.0b013e328334338f | pmc=3098750}}</ref><ref name="pmid17691917">{{cite journal |vauthors=Fujita K, Sasaki Y | title=Pharmacogenomics in drug-metabolizing enzymes catalyzing anticancer drugs for personalized cancer chemotherapy | journal=Curr.

==Metabolism and pharmacokinetics==
A single oral dose of thioguanine has incomplete metabolism, absorption and high interindividual variability. The bioavailability of thioguanine has an average of 30% (range 14-46%). The maximum concentration in plasma after a single oral dose is attained after 8 hours.

Thioguanine, like other thiopurines, is cytotoxic to white cells; as a result it is immunosuppressive at lower doses and anti-leukemic/anti-neoplastic at higher doses. Thioguanine is incorporated into human bone marrow cells, but like other thiopurines, it is not known to cross the blood-brain barrier. Thioguanine cannot be demonstrated in [[cerebrospinal fluid]], similar to the closely related compound 6-mercaptopurine which also cannot penetrate to the brain.

The plasma half-life of thioguanine is short, due to the rapid uptake into liver and blood cells and conversion to 6-TGN. The median plasma half-life of 80-minutes with a range of 25–240 minutes. Thioguanine is excreted primarily through the kidneys in urine, but mainly as a metabolite, 2-amino-6-methylthiopurine.  However, the intra-cellular thio-nucleotide metabolites of thioguanine (6-TGN) have longer half-lives and can therefore be measured after thioguanine is eliminated from the plasma.

Thioguanine is catabolized (broken down) via two pathways.<ref>{{cite book |author1= Oncea I |author2=Duley J. |chapter=Chapter 38. Pharmacogenetics of Thiopurines. |title=[[Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics]]|editor1-first=L. L. |editor1-last=Brunton |editor2-first=J. S. |editor2-last=Lazo |editor3-first=K. |editor3-last=Parker|publisher=McGraw-Hill's Access Medicine (on-line) |year=2008 |edition=11th }}</ref> One route is through the deamination by the enzyme [[guanine deaminase]] to 6-thioxanthine, which has minimal anti-neoplastic activity, then by oxidation by [[xanthine oxidase]] of the thioxanthine to [[thiouric acid]]. This metabolic pathway is not dependent on the efficacy of xanthine oxidase, so that the inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, the drug allopurinol, does not block the breakdown of thioguanine, in contrast to its inhibition of the breakdown of the related thiopurine 6-mercaptopurine. The second pathway is the methylation of thioguanine to 2-amino-6-methylthiopurine, which is minimally effective as an anti-neoplastic and significantly less toxic than thioguanine. This pathway also is independent of the enzyme activity of xanthine oxidase.

==Mechanism of action==
{{Further|Azathioprine#Mechanism of action}}
6-Thioguanine is a thio analogue of the naturally occurring purine base guanine. 6-thioguanine utilises the enzyme [[hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase]] (HGPRTase) to be converted to 6-thioguanosine monophosphate (TGMP). High concentrations of TGMP may accumulate intracellularly and hamper the synthesis of guanine nucleotides via the enzyme Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase ([[IMP dehydrogenase]]).<ref name="pmid15228163">{{cite journal |author= Evans WE. |title= Pharmacogenetics of thiopurine S-methyltransferase and thiopurine therapy. |journal= Ther Drug Monit. |volume= 26 |issue=2 |pages=186–91 |year=2004 |pmid=15228163 |doi=10.1097/00007691-200404000-00018}}</ref>

TGMP is converted by phosphorylation to thioguanosine diphosphate (TGDP) and thioguanosine triphosphate (TGTP). Simultaneously deoxyribosyl analogs are formed, via the enzyme [[ribonucleotide reductase]]. The TGMP, TGDP and TGTP are collectively named 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN). 6-TGN are cytotoxic to cells by: (1) incorporation into DNA during the synthesis phase (S-phase) of the cell; and (2) through inhibition of the GTP-binding protein ([[G protein]]) [[Rac1]], which regulates the Rac/Vav pathway.<ref name="pmid18043678">{{cite journal  |vauthors=de Boer NK, van Bodegraven AA, Jharap B, etal |title= Drug Insight: pharmacology and toxicity of thiopurine therapy in patients with IBD. |journal= Nat Clin Pract Gastroenterol Hepatol. | volume=4 |issue=12 |pages=686–94 |date=Dec 2007  |pmid=18043678 |doi=10.1038/ncpgasthep1000}}</ref> An additional effect may be derived from the incorporation of 6-thioguanine into RNA. This yields a modified RNA strand which cannot be read by the ribosomes.

==Chemistry==
It is a pale yellow, odorless, crystalline powder.

==Names==
Tioguanine ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]]), or thioguanine ([[Australian Approved Name|AAN]], [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]).

Thioguanine is administered by mouth (as a tablet – 'Lanvis').
