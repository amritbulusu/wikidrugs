It is a second generation compound that exhibits structural functionalities of the PDE4 inhibitors [[cilomilast]] and [[roflumilast]]. The structure for piclamilast was first elucidated in a 1995 European patent application.<ref>{{Cite patent|EP|0497564|application}}</ref> The earliest mention of the name "piclamilast" was used in a 1997 publication.<ref>{{cite journal | author =  | year = 1997 | title = Evidence that cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors suppress interleukin-2 release from murine splenocytes by interacting with a 'low-affinity' phosphodiesterase 4 conformer | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 121 | issue = 4 | pmid = 9208143| pages = 743–750 | url =

== Mechanism of action ==
Piclamilast functions through the selective inhibition of the four [[PDE4]] isoforms (PDE4A-D). It shows no inhibition of the other PDEs.  The PDE4 isoforms are especially important to inflammatory and immunomodulatory cells. They are the most common PDE in inflammatory cells such as [[mast cells]], [[neutrophils]], [[basophils]], [[eosinophils]], [[T lymphocytes]], [[macrophages]], and structural cells such as [[sensory nerves]] and [[epithelial cells]]. PDE4 [[hydrolyzes]] [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate]] (cAMP) to inactive [[adenosine monophosphate]] (AMP). Inhibition of PDE4 blocks hydrolysis of cAMP thereby increasing levels of cAMP within cells. cAMP suppresses the activity of immune and inflammatory cells. PDE4 inhibition in an induced chronic lung disease [[murine]] model was shown to have anti-inflammatory properties, attenuate pulmonary [[fibrin]] deposition and vascular alveolar leakage, and prolong survival in hyperoxia-induced neonatal lung injury. A study of PDE4 inhibition in a murine model of allergic asthma showed that piclamilast significantly improves the pulmonary function, airway inflammation and [[goblet cell]] hyperplasia.<ref>{{cite journal | author =  | year = 2006 | title = Inhibition of phosphodiesterase activity, airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness by PDE4 inhibitor and glucocorticoid in a murine model of allergic asthma | journal = Life Sciences | volume = 79 | issue = 22 | pmid = 16875702| pages = 2077–2085 | url =  | format =  | accessdate = | doi = 10.1016/j.lfs.2006.07.001 | last1 = Sun | first1 = J. | last2 = Deng | first2 = Y. | last3 = Wu | first3 = X. | last4 = Tang | first4 = H. | last5 = Deng | first5 = J. | last6 = Chen | first6 = J. | last7 = Yang | first7 = S. | last8 = Xie | first8 = Q. }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | year = 2008 | title = Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibition attenuates pulmonary inflammation in neonatal lung injury | journal = European Respiratory Journal | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pmid = 18094015| pages = 633–644 | url =  | format =  | accessdate = | doi = 10.1183/09031936.00071307 | last1 = De Visser | first1 = Y.

== Side effects ==
[[Vomiting]] is the most commonly cited [[side effect]] of piclamilast. It has proven difficult to separate the emetic side effects from the therapeutic benefits of several PDE4 inhibitors, including piclamilast.<ref>{{cite journal | author =  | year = 2007 | title = Correlation between emetic effect of phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors and their occupation of the high-affinity rolipram binding site in Suncus murinus brain | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 573 | issue = 1–3 | pmid = 17658510| pages = 93–99 | url =  | format =  | accessdate = | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2007.06.045 | last1 = Hirose | first1 = R. | last2 = Manabe | first2 = H. | last3 = Nonaka | first3 = H. | last4 = Yanagawa | first4 = K. | last5 = Akuta | first5 = K. | last6 = Sato | first6 = S. | last7 = Ohshima | first7 = E. | last8 = Ichimura | first8 = M. }}</ref>
