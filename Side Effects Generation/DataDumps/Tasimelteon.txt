==Development==

Tasimelteon (previously known as BMS-214,778) was developed for the treatment of [[insomnia]] and other sleep disorders. A phase II trial on circadian rhythm sleep disorders was concluded in March 2005.<ref>

On completion of Phase III trials, interpretations of the clinical trials by the research team concluded that the drug may have therapeutic potential for transient insomnia in circadian rhythm sleep disorders.<ref>

==FDA approval==
In May 2013 Vanda Pharmaceuticals submitted a [[New Drug Application]] to the [[Food and Drug Administration]] for tasimelteon for the treatment of non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder in totally blind people.  It was approved by the FDA on January 31, 2014 under the brand name Hetlioz.<ref name="approval" /> In the opinion of [[Public Citizen]], an [[advocacy group]], the FDA erroneously allowed it to be labelled without stating that it is only approved for use by totally blind people.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Carome|first1=Michael|title=Outrage of the Month: FDA Makes Major Blunder After Approving Drug for Rare Sleep Disorder|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-carome-md/outrage-of-the-month-fda-_b_7706492.html|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=8 July 2015|date=1 July 2015}}</ref> However, FDA updated its press release on Oct. 2, 2014 to clarify the approved use of Hetlioz, which includes both sighted and blind individuals. The update did not change the drug labeling (prescribing information).<ref>{{cite news|title=FDA NEWS RELEASE: FDA approves Hetlioz: first treatment for non-24 hour sleep–wake disorder in blind individuals |author=Food and Drug Administration| date=January 31, 2014|publisher=FDA |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm384092.htm}}</ref>

==Toxicity==
Experiments with rodents revealed fertility impairments, an increase in certain cancers, and serious adverse events during pregnancy at dosages in excess of what is considered the "human dose".<ref>
