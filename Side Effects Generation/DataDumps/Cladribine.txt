'''Cladribine''' is a medication used to treat [[hairy cell leukemia]] (HCL, leukemic reticuloendotheliosis) and [[B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia]].<ref name=EMA>{{cite journal|title=European Medicines Agency -  - Litak|journal=www.ema.europa.eu|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/000504/human_med_000888.jsp&amp;mid=WC0b01ac058001d124}}</ref><ref name=EMC>{{cite journal|title=Leustat Injection. - Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) - (eMC)|journal=www.medicines.org.uk|url=http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/6737}}</ref>  Its chemical name is 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (2CdA).

As a [[purine analog]], it is a synthetic chemotherapy agent that targets lymphocytes and selectively suppresses the immune system.  Chemically, it mimics the [[nucleoside]] [[adenosine]] and thus inhibits the enzyme [[adenosine deaminase]], which interferes with the cell's ability to process DNA.  Cladribine is activated only by lymphocytes, and non-activated cladribine is removed quickly from all other cells. This means that there is very little non-target cell loss.<ref name=EMA/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Leist|first1=TP|last2=Weissert|first2=R|title=Cladribine: mode of action and implications for treatment of multiple sclerosis.|journal=Clinical neuropharmacology|date=2010|volume=34|issue=1|pages=28–35|pmid=21242742|doi=10.1097/wnf.0b013e318204cd90}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
Cladribine is used for as a first and second-line treatment for symptomatic [[hairy cell leukemia]] and for [[B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia]] and is administered by intravenous infusion.<ref name=EMC/><ref name=Label>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/020229s034lbl.pdf Cladribine label], last updated July 2012.  Page accessed January 14, 2015</ref>

It used, often in combination with other cytotoxic agents, to treat various kinds of [[histiocytosis]], including [[Erdheim–Chester disease]]<ref>Histiocytosis Association [http://www.histio.org/page.aspx?pid=405#.V1BDvuTaHqk Erdheim-Chester Disease] Page accessed Aug 20, 2016</ref> and [[Langerhans cell histiocytosis]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Aricò M | year = 2016 | title = Langerhans cell histiocytosis in children: from the bench to bedside for an updated therapy | url = | journal = Br J Haematol | volume = 173 | issue = 5| pages = 663–70 | doi = 10.1111/bjh.13955 | pmid = 26913480 | quote=The combination of cytarabine and cladribine is the current standard for second-line therapy of refractory cases with vital organ dysfunction. }}</ref>

Cladribine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman and is listed by the FDA as [[Pregnancy category#United States|Pregnancy Category D]]; safety and efficacy in children has not been established.<ref name=Label/>

==Adverse effects==
Injectable cladribine suppresses the body's ability to make new blood cells (called [[Bone marrow suppression|Myelosuppression]]); data from HCL studies showed that about 70% of people taking the drug had [[Neutropenia|fewer white blood cells]] and about 30% developed infections and some of those progressed to [[septic shock]]; about 40% of people taking the drug had fewer [[red blood cells]] and became severely [[anemia|anemic]];  and about 10% of people had too few [[platelets]].<ref name=Label/>

At the dosage used to treat HCL in two clinical trials, 16% of people had rashes and 22% had nausea, the nausea generally did not lead to vomiting.<ref name=Label/>

==History==
[[Ernest Beutler]] and [[Dennis A. Carson]] had studied [[adenosine deaminase deficiency]] and recognized that because the lack of adenosine deaminase led to the destruction of B cell lymphocytes, a drug designed to inhibit adenosine deaminase might be useful in lymphomas.  Carson then synthesized cladribine, and through clinical research at Scripps starting in the 1980s, Beutler tested it as intravenous infusion and found it was especially useful to treat hairy cell leukemia (HCL).  No pharmaceutical companies were interested in selling the drug because HCL was an orphan disease, so Beutler's lab synthesized and packaged it and supplied it to the hospital pharmacy; the lab also developed a test to monitor blood levels.  This was the first treatment that led to prolonged remission of HCL, which was previously untreatable.<ref name=NASbeutler>Marshall A. Lichtman [http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/beutler-ernest.pdf Biographical Memoir: Ernest Beutler 1928–2008] National Academy of Sciences, 2012</ref>{{rp|14–15}}

In February 1991 Scripps began a collaboration with [[Johnson & Johnson]] to bring intravenous cladribine to market and by December of that year J&J had filed an [[New Drug Application|NDA]]; cladrabine was approved by the FDA in 1993 for HCL as an [[orphan drug]],<ref name=Pink1993>Staff, The Pink Sheet Mar 8, 1993 [https://pink.pharmamedtechbi.com/PS022259/ORTHO-BIOTECHs-LEUSTATIN-FOR-HAIRY-CELL-LEUKEMIA Ortho Biotech’s Leustatin For Hairy Cell Leukemia]</ref> and was approved in Europe later that year.<ref name=EMAsciLitak>EMA 2004 [http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Scientific_Discussion/human/000504/WC500041660.pdf Litak EMA package: Scientific Discussion]</ref>{{rp|2}}

===Multiple sclerosis===
In the mid-1990s Buetler, in collaboration with Jack Sipe, a neurologist at Scripps, ran several clinical trials exploring the utility of cladribine in multiple sclerosis, based on the drug's immunosuppressive effects, Sipe's insight into MS, and Buetler's interest in MS due to his sister's having it.<ref name=NASbeutler/>{{rp|17}}<ref>Eric Sauter and Mika Ono for Scripps News and Views.

In 2015 Merck KGgA announced it would again seek regulatory approval with data from the completed clinical trials in hand,<ref name=Fierce2015reup/> and in 2016 the EMA accepted its application for review.<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/merck-receives-european-medicines-agency-acceptance-for-review-of-marketing-authorization-application-for-cladribine-tablets-587207901.html Press release]</ref> On June 22, 2017, the&nbsp;EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use&nbsp;(CHMP) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a&nbsp;marketing authorisation for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/cladribine-tablets-receives-positive-chmp-opinion-for-treatment-of-relapsing-forms-of-multiple-sclerosis-630335053.html|title=Cladribine Tablets Receives Positive CHMP Opinion for Treatment of Relapsing Forms of Multiple Sclerosis|last=Merck|website=www.prnewswire.co.uk|access-date=2017-08-22}}</ref>
