'''Etanercept''' (trade name '''Enbrel''') is a [[biopharmaceutical]] that treats autoimmune diseases by interfering with [[tumor necrosis factor]] (TNF; a soluble inflammatory cytokine) by acting as a [[TNF inhibitor]]. It has U.S. F.D.A. approval to treat [[rheumatoid arthritis]], juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and [[psoriatic arthritis]], plaque psoriasis and [[ankylosing spondylitis]]. [[TNF-alpha]] is the "master regulator" of the inflammatory (immune) response in many organ systems. Autoimmune diseases are caused by an overactive immune response. Etanercept has the potential to treat these diseases by inhibiting TNF-alpha.<ref name="titleTNF defined as a therapeutic target for rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases - Nature Medicine">{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v9/n10/full/nm939.html |title=TNF defined as a therapeutic target for rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases |journal= Nature Medicine |accessdate=2008-01-10 |doi=10.1038/nm939 |volume=9 |pages=1245–1250 |pmid=14520364 |date=October 2003 |author=Feldmann M, Maini RN}}</ref>

Etanercept is a [[fusion protein]] produced by [[recombinant DNA]]. It fuses the TNF receptor to the constant end of the IgG1 antibody. First, the developers isolated the DNA sequence that codes the human gene for soluble [[CD120|TNF receptor 2]], which is a receptor that binds to tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Second, they isolated the DNA sequence that codes the human gene for the [[Fragment crystallizable region|Fc]] end of [[immunoglobulin G1]] (IgG1). Third, they linked the DNA for TNF receptor 2 to the DNA for IgG1 Fc. Finally, they expressed the linked DNA to produce a protein that links the protein for TNF receptor 2 to the protein for IgG1 Fc.
The prototypic fusion protein was first synthesized and shown to be highly active and unusually stable as a modality for blockade of TNF in vivo in the early 1990s by [[Bruce A. Beutler]], an academic researcher then at the [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas]], and his colleagues.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Peppel|first1=K.|title=A tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-IgG heavy chain chimeric protein as a bivalent antagonist of TNF activity|journal=Journal of Experimental Medicine|date=1 December 1991|volume=174|issue=6|pages=1483–1489|doi=10.1084/jem.174.6.1483|pmid=1660525|pmc=2119031}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Peppel K.

There has also been a report of [[strongyloides]] hyperinfection after use of Etanercept.<ref>http://www.uptodate.com/contents/strongyloidiasis/abstract/67?utdPopup=true</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==
It reduces the effect of naturally present TNF, and hence is a [[TNF inhibitor]], functioning as a [[decoy receptor]] that binds to TNF.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Zalevsky J, Secher T, Ezhevsky SA, etal |title=Dominant-negative inhibitors of soluble TNF attenuate experimental arthritis without suppressing innate immunity to infection |journal=J. Immunol. |volume=179 |issue=3 |pages=1872–83 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17641054 |doi= 10.4049/jimmunol.179.3.1872|url=}}</ref>

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) is a [[cytokine]] produced by [[lymphocyte]]s and [[macrophage]]s, two types of [[white blood cell]]s. It mediates the immune response by attracting additional white blood cells to sites of [[inflammation]], and through additional molecular mechanisms which initiate and amplify inflammation. Inhibition of its action by etanercept reduces the inflammatory response which is especially useful for treating [[autoimmune disease]]s.

There are two types of TNF [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s: those found embedded in white blood cells that respond to TNF by releasing other cytokines, and ''soluble'' TNF receptors which are used to deactivate TNF and blunt the immune response. In addition, TNF receptors are found on the surface of virtually all nucleated cells (red blood cells, which are not nucleated, do not contain TNF receptors on their surface). Etanercept mimics the inhibitory effects of naturally occurring soluble TNF receptors, the difference being that etanercept, because it is a fusion protein rather than a simple TNF receptor, has a greatly extended half-life in the bloodstream, and therefore a more profound and long-lasting biologic effect than a naturally occurring soluble TNF receptor.<ref name="pmid16135466">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Madhusudan S, Muthuramalingam SR, Braybrooke JP, etal |title=Study of etanercept, a tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor, in recurrent ovarian cancer |journal=J.

==Structure==
Etanercept is made from the combination of two naturally occurring soluble human 75-kilodalton TNF receptors linked to an Fc portion of an IgG1.<ref name="pmid1936291">{{Cite journal | pmid = 1936291| year = 1991| author1 = Smola| first1 = M.

==History==
Etanercept was developed by researchers at Immunex, and was released for commercial use in late 1998, soon after the release of [[infliximab]] (''Remicade''), which was the first chimeric [[monoclonal antibody]] against TNFα to be marketed for clinical use.

Etanercept is a [[protein dimer|dimeric molecule]],<ref name="pmid11712048">{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith KJ, Skelton HG |title=Rapid onset of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in patients with rheumatoid arthritis after starting tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor IgG1-Fc fusion complex therapy |journal=[[J.

During its development at Immunex Corporation an earlier monomeric version did not have sufficient biologic activity.

==Society and culture==

===Marketing===
In North America, etanercept is marketed by [[Amgen]] under the trade name Enbrel in two separate formulations, one in powder form, the other as a pre-mixed liquid. [[Wyeth]] [now part of Pfizer] was the sole marketer of Enbrel outside North America excluding Japan where [[Takeda Pharmaceuticals]] markets the drug.

===Sales===
The U.S. retail price of Enbrel has risen over time.  In 2008, the cost of Enbrel was reported to be $1,500 per month or $18,000 per year.<ref>[http://seattletimes.com/html/health/2008120449_drugs18m.html What's behind the whopping price tags on the newest generation of drugs;] The story behind the production of Enbrel, Amgen's popular rheumatoid arthritis drug, provides insights as to why bioengineered drugs are so expensive.  Carol M. Ostrom, Seattle Times, August 18, 2008</ref>  By 2011, the cost had reportedly exceeded $20,000 per year.<ref name="NYTAmgen2011">[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/23/business/amgens-new-enbrel-patent-may-undercut-health-care-plan.html Patent for Amgen Drug May Undercut Health Care Plan], By ANDREW POLLACK, New York Times, November 23, 2011</ref><ref>[http://bostonherald.com/news/columnists/view/2011_1103painful_reality Co-pay hike a painful reality; Miracle drug monthly cost jumps from $42 to $600], By Margery Eagan, Boston Herald, November 3, 2011</ref>  In 2013, a survey by the International Federation of Health Plans (IFHP) found that the average U.S. cost for Enbrel was $2,225 per month, or $26,700 per year.<ref name="IFHP2013">{{cite web |url=http://www.ifhp.com/s/2013-iFHP-FINAL-4-14-14.pdfP+FINAL+4+14+14.pdf |format=PDF |title=2013 Comparative Price Report |publisher=International Federation of Health Plans |accessdate=2015-08-14 }}</ref>  The IFHP report also found wide variation in prices charged to various U.S. health plans, between $1,946 per month at the 25th percentile and $4,006 per month at the 95th percentile.<ref name="IFHP2013" />

Enbrel is more expensive in the U.S. than in other countries.<ref name="IFHP2013" />  As of 2013, average monthly costs in surveyed nations ranged from $1,017 in Switzerland to $1,646 in Canada, compared to an average monthly cost of $2,225 per month in the U.S.<ref name="IFHP2013" />

Amgen sells Enbrel within the U.S. and Canada, while Pfizer, Inc. sells the drug outside of the U.S. and Canada.<ref name="NYTAmgen2011" />  Sales within the U.S. and Canada were $3.5 billion in 2010.<ref name="NYTAmgen2011" />  Sales of Enbrel outside the U.S. and Canada were $3.3 billion in 2010.<ref>[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78003/000119312511048877/dex13.htm Pfizer, Inc.

===Patents===
The patent on Enbrel was originally set to expire on October 23, 2012,<ref>http://www.uspto.gov/patents/resources/terms/156.html</ref> but, in the United States, a second patent, granting exclusivity for another 16 years, has been granted.<ref>http://www.burrillreport.com/article-amgen_issued_new_patent_on_ra_drug_enbrel.html</ref> Before the extension it seemed unlikely that a generic would have been available. As a biologic, etanercept is subject to different laws from those applicable to chemical formulations. Currently many countries do not permit the manufacture of generic biologics. However, the [[European Union]] and the United States ([http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ApprovalApplications/TherapeuticBiologicApplications/Biosimilars/ Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009]) do currently have in place a system to approve generic biologics ([[biosimilars]]) which "requires mandatory clinical testing and periodic review".<ref>http://www.law.duke.edu/journals/dltr/articles/2008dltr0009.html</ref>

In April 2013, the Indian pharma major Cipla made an announcement about launching the first biosimilar of Etanercept in India under the brand name 'Etacept' for the treatment of rheumatic disorders. The company's April 17, 2013 press release claimed that the biosimilar will cost 30% less as compared to the innovator.<ref>http://www.cipla.com/CiplaSite/Media/PDF/News-Archives/Press-Release-Launch-of-first-biosimilar-of-Etanercept-in-India.pdf?ext=.pdf</ref>

In January 2015, [[Samsung]] and [[Biogen]]'s joint venture "Samsung Bioepis" successfully submitted '''Benepali''', a biosimilar version of the drug, for review to the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA), and announced that it will seek regulatory approvals in other territories as well. Later the same year, the European Medicines Agency also accepted [[Sandoz]]’s application for review of its etanercept product that will be marketed by [[Novartis]].<ref>[http://www.gabionline.net/Biosimilars/News/Biosimilar-etanercept-submitted-for-approval-in-EU Biosimilar etanercept submitted for approval in EU] GaBI Online - Generics and Biosimilars Initiative (Jan 2015). Retrieved 13 July 2016.</ref>

In the US, Sandoz submitted a biologics license application (BLA) for the proposed etanercept product "GP2015" in July 2016.  Upon acceptance of the first application process, the U.S. FDA reviewed data from European clinical trials and bio-analytical investigations, demonstrating the biosimilarity of GP2015 to the US-licensed Enbrel. Sandoz in 2009 tried to invalidate the patents held by Hoffman-La Roche/Immunex and exclusively licensed to Amgen but lost in federal court. Sandoz was then countersued by Amgen for patent infringements related to the methods of treating psoriasis and/or psoriatic arthritis. The case Immunex Corp. et al. vs. Sandoz Inc. et al., 16-cv-01118-CCC-JBC (D.N.J.) is pending.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/ArthritisAdvisoryCommittee/UCM510493.pdf FDA Briefing Document Arthritis Advisory Committee Meeting July 13, 2016].

==Research==
Etanercept is being studied as treatment for a number of diseases. This includes certain forms of [[vasculitis]] (such as [[granulomatosis with polyangiitis]], in which it was not effective).<ref>{{cite journal |title=Etanercept plus standard therapy for Wegener's granulomatosis |journal=N.
