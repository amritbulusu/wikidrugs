'''Tasquinimod''' (ABR-215050, CID 54682876) is an experimental drug currently being investigated for the treatment of solid tumors. Tasquinimod has been mostly studied in [[prostate cancer]], but its mechanism of action suggests that it could be used to treat other cancers. Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), formerly called hormone-resistant or hormone-refractory prostate cancer, is prostate cancer that grows despite medical or surgical androgen deprivation therapy. Tasquinimod targets the tumor microenvironment and counteracts cancer development by inhibiting angiogenesis and metastasis and by modulating the immune system.<ref name="isaacs2006">{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/pros.20509 |title=Identification of ABR-215050 as lead second generation quinoline-3-carboxamide anti-angiogenic agent for the treatment of prostate cancer |year=2006 |last1=Isaacs |first1=John T. |last2=Pili |first2=Roberto |last3=Qian |first3=David Z. |last4=Dalrymple |first4=Susan L. |last5=Garrison |first5=Jason B. |last6=Kyprianou |first6=Natasha |last7=Björk |first7=Anders |last8=Olsson |first8=Anders |last9=Leanderson |first9=Tomas |journal=The Prostate |volume=66 |issue=16 |pages=1768–78 |pmid=16955399 }}</ref><ref name="isaacs2012">{{cite journal |doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-2730 |title=Tasquinimod is an Allosteric Modulator of HDAC4 Survival Signaling within the Compromised Cancer Microenvironment |year=2012 |last1=Isaacs |first1=J.

== Mechanism of action ==
Tasquinimod is a novel small-molecule inhibitor that targets the tumor microenvironment by controlling the accumulation and immunosuppressive, pro-angiogenic and pro-metastatic functions of regulatory myeloid cells (also called myeloid-derived suppressor cells).<ref name="isaacs2006" /><ref name="kallberg2012" /><ref name="jennbacken2012" /><ref name="murdoch2008">{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nrc2444 |title=The role of myeloid cells in the promotion of tumour angiogenesis |year=2008 |last1=Murdoch |first1=Craig |last2=Muthana |first2=Munitta |last3=Coffelt |first3=Seth B. |last4=Lewis |first4=Claire E. |journal=Nature Reviews Cancer |volume=8 |issue=8 |pages=618–31 |pmid=18633355}}</ref> It binds to and inhibits the interactions of [[S100A9]], an immunomodulatory protein that promotes tumor development,<ref name="turovskaya2008">{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/carcin/bgn188 |title=RAGE, carboxylated glycans and S100A8/A9 play essential roles in colitis-associated carcinogenesis |year=2008 |last1=Turovskaya |first1=O. |last2=Foell |first2=D. |last3=Sinha |first3=P. |last4=Vogl |first4=T. |last5=Newlin |first5=R. |last6=Nayak |first6=J. |last7=Nguyen |first7=M. |last8=Olsson |first8=A. |last9=Nawroth |first9=P.

Tasquinimod may also target the tumor microenvironment by suppressing the tumor hypoxic response, in which genes involved in the adaptation and survival of cells during hypoxia are induced.<ref name="isaacs2012" /> Tasquinimod reduces tumor [[angiogenesis]]; but its anti-angiogenic effects do not appear to be linked to [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF) neutralization or VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition.<ref name="isaacs2006" /><ref name="olsson2010" />

== Clinical studies ==
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II study comparing tasquinimod with placebo in 206 men with metastatic CRPC was completed in 2009.<ref name=pili2011 /> The primary endpoint in the trial was to show a difference in the number of patients with disease progression at 6 months.<ref name=pili2011 /> The proportion of patients who were disease progression-free after 6 months was 69% for patients treated with tasquinimod versus 37% for placebo-treated patients (p<0.001).<ref name=pili2011 /> Median [[progression-free survival]] (PFS) was significantly improved in patients treated with tasquinimod compared with patients receiving placebo (7.6 vs 3.3 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39, 0.85, p=0.0042).<ref name=pili2011 /> Tasquinimod thus delayed disease progression by about 4.3 months. Overall survival (OS) observed for tasquinimod-treated patients was longer than previously reported in this patient population.<ref name=armstrong2012 /> Median overall survival was 33.4 months for the tasquinimod group versus 30.4 months for the placebo group (p=0.49).<ref name=armstrong2012 /> Using a multivariate analysis, treatment with tasquinimod was associated with an OS advantage with a HR of 0.64 (95% CI 0.42, 0.97, p=0.034).<ref name=armstrong2012 /> It was hypothesized that the prolongation in PFS observed with tasquinimod treatment may lead to a survival advantage in men with metastatic CRPC. Also, a stronger trend for survival benefit was seen in patients with bone metastases; 34.2 for the tasquinimod group vs 27.1 months for the placebo group (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.46, 1.17, p=0.19).<ref name=armstrong2012 /> 

Analysis of up to 3 years of safety data from phase II studies showed that treatment-related [[adverse event]]s were mild to moderate, manageable and less frequent after 2 months of therapy.<ref name=ABPRDec2012 /> Adverse events observed included gastrointestinal disorders, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain as well as elevations of some laboratory parameters.<ref name=ABPRDec2012 /> 

A phase III randomized controlled trial called 10TASQ10<ref name="NCT01234311" /> to confirm tasquinimod’s effect on disease progression is ongoing. More than 1,200 patients with asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic metastatic CRPC were successfully enrolled in the study, as planned in the clinical protocol.<ref name=ABPRDec2012 /> The study is expected to complete in 2016.<ref name=NCT01234311 /> Other indications are currently under investigation.<ref name=NCT01234311 /><ref name="NCT01743469">{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT01743469|A Study With Tasquinimod Treating Patients in Four Independent Cohorts of Hepatocellular, Ovarian, Renal Cell and Gastric Cancers}}</ref>
