== Medical use ==

Clopidogrel is used to prevent heart attack and stroke in people who are at high risk of these events, including those with a history of myocardial infarction and other forms of [[acute coronary syndrome]], stroke, and those with [[peripheral artery disease]].

Treatment with clopidogrel or a related drug is recommended by the [[American Heart Association]] and the [[American College of Cardiology]] for people who:

Consensus-based therapeutic guidelines also recommend the use of clopidogrel rather than ASA for antiplatelet therapy in people with a history of gastric ulceration, as inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins by ASA can exacerbate this condition.

In the CURE trial, people with acute coronary syndrome without [[ST elevation]] were treated with aspirin plus clopidogrel or placebo and followed for up to one year. The following rates of major bleed were seen:<ref name="PrescribingInfo" />
* Any major bleeding: clopidogrel 3.7%, placebo 2.7%
* Life-threatening bleeding: clopidogrel 2.2%, placebo 1.8%
* Hemorrhagic stroke: clopidogrel 0.1%, placebo 0.1%

The CAPRIE trial compared clopidogrel monotherapy to aspirin monotherapy for 1.6 years in people who had recently experienced a stroke or heart attack. In this trial the following rates of bleeding were observed.<ref name="PrescribingInfo" />
* Gastrointestinal hemorrhage: clopidogrel 2.0%, aspirin 2.7%
* Intracranial bleeding: clopidogrel 0.4%, aspirin 0.5%

In CAPRIE, itching was the only adverse effect seen more frequently with clopidogrel than aspirin.  In CURE, there was no difference in the rate of non-bleeding adverse events.<ref name="PrescribingInfo" />

[[Rashes]] and itching were uncommon in studies (between 0.1 and 1% of people); serious [[hypersensitivity]] reactions are rare.<ref name="Austria-Codex" />

== Interactions ==
Clopidogrel generally has a low potential to interact with other pharmaceutical drugs. Combination with other drugs that affect blood clotting, such as [[aspirin]], [[heparin]]s and [[thrombolytic drug|thrombolytic]]s, showed no relevant interactions. [[Naproxen]] did increase the likelihood of [[occult bleeding|occult]] [[gastrointestinal bleeding]], as might be the case with other [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s. As clopidogrel inhibits the liver enzyme [[CYP2C9]] in cellular models, it has been theorized that it might increase blood plasma levels of drugs that are metabolized by this enzyme, such as [[phenytoin]] and [[tolbutamide]]. Clinical studies showed that this mechanism is irrelevant for practical purposes.<ref name="Austria-Codex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Jasek, W|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2007|edition=62nd|isbn=978-3-85200-181-4|pages=6526–7|language=German}}</ref>

== Pharmacology ==

=== Mechanism of action ===
Clopidogrel acts by inhibiting the ADP receptor on [[platelet]] cell membranes. It is a [[prodrug]], which requires CYP2C19 for its activation.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=23046071 | doi=10.1089/gtmb.2012.0119 | volume=16 | title=The influence of omeprazole on platelet inhibition of clopidogrel in various CYP2C19 mutant alleles | year=2012 | journal=Genet Test Mol Biomarkers | pages=1293–7 |vauthors=Liu Q, Dang DS, Chen YF, Yan M, Shi GB, Zhao QC }}</ref> The drug specifically and irreversibly inhibits the [[P2Y12|P2Y<sub>12</sub>]] subtype of ADP receptor, which is important in activation of platelets and eventual cross-linking by the protein [[fibrin]].<ref name=Brown2015>{{cite journal|vauthors=Brown DG, Wilkerson EC, Love WE | title=A review of traditional and novel oral anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy for dermatologists and dermatologic surgeons|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology|volume=72|issue=3|pages=524–34|date=March 2015|pmid=25486915|doi= 10.1016/j.jaad.2014.10.027}}</ref>
Platelet inhibition can be demonstrated two hours after a single dose of oral clopidogrel, but the onset of action is slow, so a loading dose of either 600 or 300&nbsp;mg is administered when a rapid effect is needed.<ref>Clopidogrel {{Drugs.com|MTM|clopidogrel}}</ref>

=== Pharmacokinetics and metabolism ===
[[File:Clopidogrel activation.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.5|Clopidogrel (top left) being activated: The first step is an oxidation mediated (mainly) by CYP2C19, unlike the activation of the related drug prasugrel. The two structures at the bottom are [[tautomer]]s of each other; and the final step is a hydrolysis. The active metabolite (top right) has [[E-Z notation|''Z''&nbsp;configuration]] at the double bond C3–C16 and possibly [[Chirality (chemistry)#By configuration: R- and S-|''R''&nbsp;configuration]] at the newly asymmetric C4.<ref name="metabolite">

After repeated oral doses of 75&nbsp;mg of clopidogrel (base), plasma concentrations of the parent compound, which has no platelet-inhibiting effect, are very low and, in general, are below the quantification limit (0.258&nbsp;µg/l) beyond two hours after dosing.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Clopidogrel is activated in the liver by cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP2C19. Due to opening of the thiophene ring, the chemical structure of the active metabolite has three sites that are stereochemically relevant, making a total of eight possible isomers. These are: a stereocentre at C4 (attached to the —SH thiol group), a double bond at C3—C16, and the original stereocentre at C7. Only one of the eight structures is an active antiplatelet drug. This has the following configuration: ''Z'' configuration at the C3—C16 double bond, the original ''S'' configuration at C7,<ref name="metabolite" /> and, although the stereocentre at C4 cannot be directly determined, as the thiol group is too reactive, work with the active metabolite of the related drug prasugrel suggests the ''R''-configuration of the C4 group is critical for P2Y<sub>12</sub> and platelet-inhibitory activity.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The active metabolite has an elimination half-life of about 0.5 to 1.0 h, and acts by forming a disulfide bridge with the platelet ADP receptor. Patients with a variant allele of CYP2C19 are 1.5 to 3.5 times more likely to die or have complications than patients with the high-functioning allele.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mega JL, Close SL, Wiviott SD, Shen L, Hockett RD, Brandt JT, Walker JR, Antman EM, Macias W, Braunwald E, Sabatine MS | title = Cytochrome p-450 polymorphisms and response to clopidogrel | journal = [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] | volume = 360 | issue = 4 | pages = 354–62 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19106084 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa0809171}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Simon T, Verstuyft C, Mary-Krause M, Quteineh L, Drouet E, Méneveau N, Steg PG, Ferrières J, Danchin N, ((Becquemont L, French Registry of Acute ST-Elevation Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (FAST-MI) Investigators)) | title = Genetic Determinants of Response to Clopidogrel and Cardiovascular Events | journal = [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] | volume = 360 | issue = 4 | pages = 363–75 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19106083 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa0808227}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Collet JP, Hulot JS, Pena A, Villard E, Esteve JB, Silvain J, Payot L, Brugier D, Cayla G, Beygui F, Bensimon G, Funck-Brentano C, Montalescot G | title = Cytochrome P450 2C19 polymorphism in young patients treated with clopidogrel after myocardial infarction: a cohort study | journal = [[The Lancet]] | volume = 373 | issue = 9660 | pages = 309–17 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19108880 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61845-0}}</ref>

Following an oral dose of <sup>14</sup>C-labeled clopidogrel in humans, about 50% was excreted in the urine and 46% in the feces in the five days after dosing.

*Effect of food: Administration of clopidogrel bisulfate with meals did not significantly modify the bioavailability of clopidogrel as assessed by the pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite.
*Absorption and distribution: Clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed after oral administration of repeated doses of 75-milligram clopidogrel (base), with peak plasma levels (about 3&nbsp;mg/l) of the main circulating metabolite occurring around one hour after dosing. The pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite are linear (plasma concentrations increased in proportion to dose) in the dose range of 50 to 150&nbsp;mg of clopidogrel. Absorption is at least 50% based on urinary excretion of clopidogrel-related metabolites.
Clopidogrel and the main circulating metabolite bind reversibly ''in vitro'' to human plasma proteins (98% and 94%, respectively). The binding is not saturable ''in vitro'' up to a concentration of 110&nbsp;μg/ml.

*Metabolism and elimination: ''In vitro'' and ''in vivo'', clopidogrel undergoes rapid hydrolysis into its [[carboxylic acid]] derivative. In plasma and urine, the glucuronide of the carboxylic acid derivative is also observed.

In March 2010, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] added a boxed warning to Plavix alerting that the drug can be less effective in people unable to metabolize the drug to convert it to its active form.<ref name="FDA Black Box">{{cite press release| title = FDA Announces New Boxed Warning on Plavix: Alerts patients, health care professionals to potential for reduced effectiveness| date = March 12, 2010| url = http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm204253.htm| publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)| accessdate = March 13, 2010| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100315133622/http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm204253.htm| archivedate = March 15, 2010| df = }}</ref><ref>

=== Pharmacogenetics ===
CYP2C19 is an important drug-metabolizing enzyme that catalyzes the biotransformation of many clinically useful drugs, including antidepressants, barbiturates, proton pump inhibitors, and antimalarial and antitumor drugs. Clopidogrel is one of the drugs metabolized by this enzyme.

Several recent landmark studies have proven the importance of 2C19 genotyping in treatment using clopidogrel. In March 2010, the FDA put a black box warning on Plavix to make patients and healthcare providers aware that CYP2C19-poor metabolizers, representing up to 14% of patients, are at high risk of treatment failure and that testing is available.<ref name="FDA Black Box" /> Patients with variants in cytochrome P-450 2C19 (CYP2C19) have lower levels of the active metabolite of clopidogrel, less inhibition of platelets, and a 3.58-times greater risk for major adverse cardiovascular events such as death, heart attack, and stroke; the risk was greatest in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.pgxnews.org/web/the-news/1-latest-news/47-fda-updates-plavix-label-with-pgx-data | title=FDA updates Plavix label with PGx data | author=PGxNews.Org| publisher=PGxNews.Org| accessdate=2009-06-13|date=June 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
