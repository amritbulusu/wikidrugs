==Medical uses==
It is used for angina, in addition to other medications for congestive heart failure, and for esophageal spasms.<ref name="AHFS2016"/>

Long-acting nitrates can be more useful as they are generally more effective and stable in the short term.

==Side effects==

After long-term use for treating chronic conditions, tolerance may develop in patients, reducing its effectiveness.  The mechanisms of [[nitrate tolerance]] have been thoroughly investigated in the last 30 years and several hypotheses have been proposed. These include: 
#  Severe allergic reactions (rash; hives; itching; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue); fainting; fast or slow heartbeat; nausea; new or worsening chest pain; vomiting.
# Impaired biotransformation of ISDN to its active principle NO (or a NO-related species)
# Neurohormonal activation, causing sympathetic activation and release of vasoconstrictors such as endothelin and angiotensin II which counteract the vasodilation induced by ISDN
# Plasma volume expansion
# The oxidative stress hypothesis (proposed by Munzel et al. in 1995)

The last hypothesis might represent a unifying hypothesis, and an ISDN-induced inappropriate production of oxygen free radicals might induce a number of abnormalities which include the ones described above. 
Furthermore, nitrate tolerance is shown to be associated with vascular abnormalities which have the potential to worsen patients prognosis:<ref>(Nakamura et al.)</ref> these include endothelial and autonomic dysfunction.<ref>(Gori et al.).</ref>   
In the short run, ISDN can cause severe headaches, necessitating analgesic (very rarely up to morphine)  administration for relief of pain, as well as severe hypotension, and, in certain cases, bradycardia. This makes some physicians nervous and should prompt caution when starting nitrate administration.

==Society and culture==
Isosorbide dinitrate is sold in the USA under the brand names Dilatrate-SR by [[Schwarz Pharma|Schwarz]] and Isordil by [[Valeant Pharmaceuticals|Valeant]], according to [[Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations|FDA Orange Book]]. In the United Kingdom, Argentina, and Hong Kong, a trade name of it is Isoket. It is also a component of [[BiDil]].
