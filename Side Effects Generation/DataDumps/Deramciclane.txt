==Commercial history==
Deramciclane was discovered by EGIS Pharmaceuticals Ltd in Budapest, Hungary. In 2000, EGIS signed over exclusive rights to Orion Pharma to further develop, register, and market deramciclane. Successful pre-clinical, Phase I, and Phase II trials looked promising to the company and its investors even up until the third quarter of 2002.<ref name="Blow">Blow to Orion as deramciclane fails in Phase III anxiety studies, 2003 http://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/blow-to-orion-as-deramciclane-fails-in-phase-iii-anxiety-studies</ref> Phase I studies show little to no side effects of deramciclane.<ref name="Huupponen1"/><ref name="Drabant">{{Cite journal

===Metabolism===
It is important to understand the metabolism pathway of a drug to better understand its pharmacology, toxicity, and animal model predictability. The metabolism pathway in humans is not entirely clear, though certain reactions have been shown to happen in the breakdown of deramciclane.  For example, deramciclane undergoes [[side chain modification]] and [[oxidation]] at multiple positions on the molecule.<ref name="Monostory"/>  The side chain reaction forms [[phenylborneol]] and N-desmethyl deramciclane which is the active metabolite of deramciclane.<ref name="Monostory"/>  Oxidation of the molecule results in many hydroxy-, carboxy-, and N-oxide derivatives.<ref name="Monostory"/>

===Food interaction===
Also important to the pharmacokinetics of a drug is its interactions with food during adsorption because this affects the dosage required. Deramciclane is an acid-labile compound. Acid-labile compounds are more easily broken down in acidic environments, so the decrease in stomach pH as a result of the presence of food could have adverse effects on the bioavailability of deramciclane. Clinical studies investigating the effects of food or lack thereof on deramciclane adsorption show that there is a statistically significant, but not clinically relevant, increase in bioavailability of deramciclane when administered with food because the point of critical instability of deramciclane is relatively low at a pH of 2. The presence of food does not affect deramciclane’s elimination [[half-life]] (T1/2) or mean [[residence time (fluid dynamics)|residence time]] (MRT).<ref name="Drabant"/>

==Safety and side effects==
All clinical studies have shown that deramciclane is well-tolerated in humans at dosages ranging between 0.2–150&nbsp;mg.<ref name="Kanerva1"/> All reported side effects were mild-moderate with the most common side effect being headache and dizziness. No severe side effects were reported in any clinical trial, and no side effects were found to be dose-dependent.<ref name="Kanerva1"/> Trial participants showed no significant increases in liver [[enzyme]] activity<ref name="Huupponen1"/> and no changes in [[ECG]]s,<ref name="Huupponen1"/> [[systolic blood pressure]], [[diastolic blood pressure]], [[HDL cholesterol]], or [[LDL cholesterol]] levels.<ref name="Kanerva2"/> Another advantage to deramciclane is that it did not produce any withdrawal effects after long-term studies, like other anxiolytics do.
