'''Procaine''' is a [[local anesthetic]] drug of the [[amino esters|amino ester]] group. It is used primarily to reduce the pain of [[intramuscular injection]] of [[penicillin]], and it is also used in [[dentistry]]. Owing to the ubiquity of the [[trade name]] '''Novocain''', in some regions, procaine is referred to [[Generic trademark|generically]] as '''novocaine'''. It acts mainly as a [[sodium channel blocker]].<ref>[http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00721 DrugBank - Showing drug card for Procaine (DB00721)] Update Date 2009-06-23</ref> Today it is used therapeutically in some countries due to its [[sympatholytic]], [[anti-inflammatory]], [[perfusion]]-enhancing, and [[Mood disorder|mood-enhancing]] effects.<ref>J.D.

Prior to the discovery of [[amylocaine]] and procaine, [[cocaine]] was the most commonly used local anesthetic.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Einhorn wished his new discovery to be used for amputations, but surgeons preferred general anesthetic.

==Pharmacology==

The primary use for procaine is as an anaesthetic.

Procaine is used less frequently today since more effective (and [[hypoallergenic]]) alternatives such as [[lidocaine]] (Xylocaine) exist. Like other local anesthetics (such as [[mepivacaine]], and [[prilocaine]]), procaine is a vasodilator,  thus is often coadministered with [[epinephrine]] for the purpose of [[vasoconstriction]]. Vasoconstriction helps to reduce bleeding, increases the duration and quality of anesthesia, prevents the drug from reaching systemic circulation in large amounts, and overall reduces the amount of anesthetic required.<ref>Sisk AL. Vasoconstrictors in local anesthesia for dentistry. Anesth Prog. 1992;39:187–93.</ref> Unlike [[cocaine]], a vasoconstrictor, procaine does not have the [[euphoria|euphoric]] and addictive qualities that put it at risk for abuse. 

Procaine, an [[ester]] anesthetic, is metabolized in the [[blood plasma|plasma]] by the enzyme [[Butyrylcholinesterase|pseudocholinesterase]] through [[hydrolysis]] into [[para-Amino benzoic acid|para-amino benzoic acid]] (PABA), which is then excreted by the [[kidney]]s into the [[urine]].

Procaine is the primary ingredient in the controversial preparation [[Gerovital H3]] by [[Ana Aslan]] ([[Romania]]), which is claimed by its advocates to remedy many effects of aging. The mainstream medical view is that these claims were seriously studied and discredited in the 1960s.

A 1% procaine injection has been recommended for the treatment of extravasation complications associated with venipuncture (along with moist heat, <!-- ??? ASA, --> steroids, and antibiotics).  It has likewise been recommended for treatment of inadvertent intra-arterial injections (10&nbsp;ml of 1% procaine), as it helps relieve pain and vascular spasm.

Procaine is an occasional additive in illicit street drugs, such as cocaine. [[MDMA]] manufacturers also use procaine as an additive at ratios ranging from 1:1 up to 10% MDMA with 90% procaine, which can be life-threatening.<ref>http://www.ecstasydata.org/search.php?substance1=2023</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Application of procaine leads to the depression of neuronal activity. The depression causes the nervous system to become hypersensitive, producing restlessness and shaking, leading to minor to severe convulsions. Studies on animals have shown the use of procaine led to the increase of [[dopamine]] and [[serotonin]] levels in the brain.<ref>Sawaki, K., and Kawaguchim, M. "Some Correlations between procaine-induced convulsions and monoamides in the spinal cord of rats". Japanese Journal of Pharmacology,51(3), 1989, p. 369-376.</ref>  Other issues may occur because of varying individual tolerance to procaine dosage. Nervousness and dizziness can arise from the excitation of the central nervous system, which may lead to respiratory failure if overdosed. Procaine may also induce weakening of the [[myocardium]] leading to [[cardiac arrest]].<ref>http://www.drugs.com/pro/novocain.html - Novocain Official FDA information. Updated(08/2007)</ref>

Procaine can also cause allergic reactions causing individuals to have problems with breathing, rashes, and swelling. Allergic reactions to procaine are usually not in response to procaine itself, but to its metabolite PABA. About one in 3000 white North Americans is homozygotic (i.e. has two copies of the abnormal gene) for the most common atypical form of the enzyme pseudocholinesterase,<ref name=OMIM_BCh>{{cite web|title=BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE|url=http://www.omim.org/entry/177400|website=OMIM|accessdate=4 September 2015}}</ref> and do not hydrolyze ester anesthetics such as procaine. This results in a prolonged period of high levels of the anesthetic in the blood and increased toxicity. However, certain populations in the world such as the Vysya community in India commonly have a deficiency of this enzyme.<ref name=OMIM_BCh />

==Synthesis==
Procaine can be [[organic synthesis|synthesized]] in two ways.

#The first consists of the direct reaction of the 4-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester with [[2-diethylaminoethanol]] in the presence of sodium ethoxide. 
#The second is by oxidizing [[4-nitrotoluene]] to 4-nitrobenzoic acid, which is further reacted with [[thionyl chloride]], the resulting acid chloride is then esterified with 2-diethylaminoethanol to give [[Nitrocaine]]. Finally, the nitro group is reduced by hydrogenation over [[Raney nickel]] catalyst.
