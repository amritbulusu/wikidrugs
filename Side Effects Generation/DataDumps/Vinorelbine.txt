==Side effects==
Vinorelbine has a number of side-effects that can limit its use:

[[Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy]] (a progressive, enduring and often irreversible tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes involving the arms and legs<ref name = NCI>{{vcite journal | author = del Pino BM | date = Feb 23, 2010 | journal = [[NCI Cancer Bulletin]] | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | page = 6 | title = Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy | url = http://www.cancer.gov/aboutnci/ncicancerbulletin/archive/2010/022310/page6}}</ref>), lowered resistance to infection, bruising or bleeding, [[anaemia]], [[constipation]], vomitings, [[diarrhea]], [[nausea]], tiredness and a general feeling of weakness ([[asthenia]]), inflammation of the vein into which it was injected  ([[phlebitis]]).  Seldom severe [[hyponatremia]] is seen.

Less common effects are hair loss and allergic reaction.

==Pharmacology==
The antitumor activity is due to inhibition of mitosis through interaction with tubulin.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Jordan  | first1 = M.

==History==
Vinorelbine was invented by the pharmacist Pierre Potier and his team from the [[CNRS]] in [[France]] in the 1980s and was licensed to the oncology department of the [[Pierre Fabre Group]].  The drug was approved in France in 1989 under the brand name Navelbine for the treatment of non-small cell [[lung cancer]]. It gained approval to treat [[metastatic breast cancer]] in 1991. Vinorelbine received approval by the [[United States]] [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in December 1994 sponsored by Burroughs Wellcome Company. Pierre Fabre Group now markets Navelbine in the U.S., where the drug went generic in February 2003.

In most European countries, vinorelbine is approved to treat non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer. In the United States it is approved only for non-small cell lung cancer.

==Oral formulation==
An oral formulation has been marketed and registered in most European countries.  It has similar efficacy as the intravenous formulation, but it avoids venous toxicities of an infusion and is easier to take.{{medcn|date=May 2015}}  The oral form is not approved in the United States or Australia.{{medcn|date=May 2015}}
