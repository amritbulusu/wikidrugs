'''Tiflorex''', formerly known as '''flutiorex''', is a [[stimulant]] [[amphetamine]]. Its most pronounced effect is in suppression of appetite; it has little effect on pulse rate, sleep, or mood.<ref name="brjclinpharm">T. Silverstone, Jill Fincham & Jill Plumley. An evaluation of the anorectic activity in man of a sustained release formulation of tiflorex. ''British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology'', 1979, 7, 353–356.</ref> It was found to be twice as potent an anorectic as [[fenfluramine]].<ref name="br j 1976">{{cite journal | author = J.F.
