'''''N,N''-Dipropyltryptamine''' ('''DPT''', also known as "The Light") is a [[Psychedelics, Dissociatives and Deliriants|psychedelic]] [[psychoactive drug|drug]] belonging to the [[tryptamine]] family, first reported in 1973.<ref>''International Pharmacopsychiatry''. 1973;8(1):104.</ref>  It is found either as its [[crystalline]] [[hydrochloride]] [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] or as an oily or crystalline [[base (chemistry)|base]].  It has not been found to occur naturally. It is a close structural [[Homology (chemistry)|homologue]] of [[dimethyltryptamine]].

Frequent physical effects are [[nausea]], [[paresthesia|numbness]] of the [[tongue]] or [[throat]], and [[mydriasis|pupil dilation]].

== Pharmacology ==

Studies on rodents have found that the effectiveness with which a selective [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor]] [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]] blocks the behavioral actions of this compound strongly suggest that the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor is an important site of action for DPT, but the modulatory actions of a [[5-HT1A receptor|5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor]] antagonist also imply a 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>-mediated component to the actions of DPT.<ref>William E. Fantegrossi, Chad J. Reissig, Elyse B. Katz, Haley L. Yarosh, Kenner C. Rice, Jerrold C. Winterb. Hallucinogen-like effects of N,N-dipropyltryptamine (DPT): possible mediation by serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors in rodents. Pharmacol Biochem Behav. 2008 January; 88(3): 358–365.</ref>

== Chemistry ==

DPT changes [[Ehrlich's reagent]] violet and causes the marquis reagent to turn yellow.<ref name='microgram2005'>{{cite journal | title = Analytical Profiles for Five "Designer" Tryptamines

== Psychedelic properties ==

While dipropyltryptamine is chemically similar to [[dimethyltryptamine]] (DMT), its psychoactive effects are markedly different.<ref>{{cite book

The most prominent features of the DPT experience are increased significance or intensity of [[music]], [[color]]s take on a new intensity or appearance, the body may have a buzz or vibratory feeling, a pleasant sensation of warmth, complete [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]] loss, [[apparitional experience|apparitions]] of faces.  {{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

While seeing other beings under the influence of DPT may occasionally occur, the perspective is more as an observer or watcher, as contrasted to the more personal real-feeling entity contact reported with DMT.<ref>{{cite book

Also sometimes reported is a loss of ego boundary; for example, the boundary between the [[self]] and a [[Table (furniture)|table]] may not be easy to distinguish.  Difficulty distinguishing other boundaries is common as well. For example, different colors may be difficult to distinguish.  Other sensory input may also become blended.  This is distinct from [[synaesthesia]].  {{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

A user may also encounter the feeling of experiencing the life of someone else, or having had all possible experiences simultaneously. One may have the experience of seeing the [[universe]] from different locations in [[space]] and [[time]]. {{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Visuals are often geometric, wavy, and/or spiraled. Other visual distortions and hallucinations tend to be experienced in the peripheral vision. The self or the environment may take on a stylized [[cartoon]]-like look or feel. Pleasant flashes of light and sparkles are also common. {{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

== Side Effects ==
Negative side effects of human consumption of this drug can include, increased heart rate, dizziness, and nausea. There is one death associated with the use of dipropyltryptamine, which appears to have been the result of a fatal seizure caused by the drug itself. The dosage taken by the victim was unknown however the drug has never been known to cause harm at usual doses so any fatality can be assumed to be a massive overdose. <ref>[http://www.startribune.com/carver-county-teen-s-death-puts-spotlight-on-ease-of-purchasing-synthetic-drugs-online/330344661/]</ref>

== Religious use ==

DPT is used as a [[religious]] [[sacrament]] by the [[Temple of the True Inner Light]], a [[New York City]] offshoot of the [[Native American Church]]. The Temple believes DPT and other [[entheogen]]s are physical manifestations of [[God]].<ref>[http://psychede.tripod.com/ Temple of the True Inner Light<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
