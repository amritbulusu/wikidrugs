'''Rivaroxaban''', sold under the brand name '''Xarelto,''' among others, is an [[anticoagulant]] medication (blood thinner), which is taken by mouth. It is commonly used to prevent [[Embolism|blood clots]]. It was initially developed by [[Bayer]]. In the United States, it is marketed by [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]]. It is the first available active [[direct factor Xa inhibitor]] which is taken by mouth. The maximum inhibition of [[factor X]]a occurs four hours after a dose. The effects last approximately 8–12 hours, but factor Xa activity does not return to normal within 24 hours, so once-daily dosing is possible.

Rivaroxaban was patented in the United States in 2007, approved for medical use in 2011, and begins to lose its patent coverage in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|title=Generic Xarelto Availability - Drugs.com|url=https://www.drugs.com/availability/generic-xarelto.html|website=Drugs.com|accessdate=9 May 2017}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
In those with non-valvular [[atrial fibrillation]] it appears to be as effective as [[warfarin]] in preventing nonhemorrhagic strokes and embolic events.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gómez-Outes |first1=A |last2= Terleira-Fernández |first2=AI|last3=Calvo-Rojas |first3=G|last4=Suárez-Gea |first4=ML |last5=Vargas-Castrillón |first5=E |title= Dabigatran, Rivaroxaban, or Apixaban versus Warfarin in Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Subgroups. |journal= Thrombosis |date= 2013 |volume= 2013 |pages= 640723 |pmid= 24455237 |doi= 10.1155/2013/640723 |pmc= 3885278}}</ref> Rivaroxaban is associated with lower rates of serious and fatal bleeding events than warfarin though rivaroxaban is associated with higher rates of bleeding in the [[gastrointestinal tract]].<ref name=Brown2015>{{cite journal |vauthors= Brown DG, Wilkerson EC, Love WE |title= A review of traditional and novel oral anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy for dermatologists and dermatologic surgeons |journal= Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology |volume=72 |issue=3 |pages= 524–34 |date=March 2015 |pmid= 25486915 |doi= 10.1016/j.jaad.2014.10.027}}</ref>

In July 2012, the UK´s [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] recommended rivaroxaban  to prevent and treat venous thromboembolism.<ref>[http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/TA261 NICE guidance TA261 NICE guidance TA261]. National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, July 2012</ref>

==Adverse effects==
The most serious adverse effect is [[bleeding]], including severe [[internal bleeding]].<ref>{{cite web |title= Medication Guide--Xarelto |url= http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DrugSafety/UCM280333.pdf |publisher= U.S. Food and Drug Administration |accessdate= 1 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= Xarelto Side Effects |url= http://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-156265/xarelto-oral/details/list-sideeffects |publisher= WebMD |accessdate=1 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Xarelto Side Effects Center |url= http://www.rxlist.com/xarelto-side-effects-drug-center.htm |publisher= RxList |accessdate= 1 September 2014}}</ref> Rivaroxaban is associated with lower rates of serious and fatal bleeding events than warfarin but is associated with higher rates of bleeding in the [[gastrointestinal tract]].<ref name=Brown2015/> There is currently no antidote for rivaroxaban (unlike warfarin, the action of which can be reversed with [[vitamin K]] or [[prothrombin complex concentrate]]), meaning that serious bleeding may be difficult to manage.

In October 2014, Portola Pharmaceuticals completed Phase I and II clinical trials for [[andexanet alfa]] as an antidote for Factor Xa inhibitors with few adverse effects, and started Phase III trials.<ref>{{cite web |last1= Schroeder |first1=C. |title= Possible Antidote Could Help Blood Thinner Patients In Bleeding Emergencies |url= https://www.drugnews.net/news/antidote-xarelto-blood-thinner-patients-emergency/ |website= DrugNews |accessdate= 20 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title= Recent advances in the development of specific antidotes for target-specific oral anticoagulants |vauthors= Mo Y, Yam FK |journal= Pharmacotherapy |date= Feb 2015 |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=198–207 |doi= 10.1002/phar.1532 |pmid= 25644580}}</ref> Andexanet alfa was expected to be approved in 2016.<ref name="reuters">{{Cite web |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pharmaceuticals-bloodthinners-idUSKBN0U617320151223 |title= New blood thinner 'antidote' to help doctors move past warfarin |last=Bill Berkrot  |date=December 23, 2015 |publisher=Reuters}}</ref>{{As of| 2017}}, the compound has yet to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Rivaroxaban has a [[boxed warning]] to make clear that people using the drug should not discontinue it before talking with their health care professional, because it can increase the risk of stroke.<ref name="fda-Xarelto-label">{{cite web|title = XARELTO (rivaroxaban) label|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/022406s015lbl.pdf|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Association}}</ref>

In 2015, rivaroxaban accounted for the highest number of reported cases of serious injury among regularly monitored drugs to the FDA's Adverse Events Reporting System (AERS).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schroeder|first1=C|title=ISMP Ranks Xarelto Most Dangerous Drug in the United States|url=https://www.drugnews.net/news/ismp-ranks-xarelto-most-dangerous-drug-in-US|website=DrugNews|publisher=DrugNews|accessdate=10 August 2016}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Rivaroxaban inhibits both free Factor Xa and Factor Xa bound in the [[prothrombinase|prothrombinase complex]].<ref name=discovery>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Roehrig S, Straub A, Pohlmann J, etal |title=Discovery of the novel antithrombotic agent 5-chloro-N-({(5S)-2-oxo-3- [4-(3-oxomorpholin-4-yl)phenyl]-1,3-oxazolidin-5-yl}methyl)thiophene- 2-carboxamide (BAY 59-7939): an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor |journal=Journal of Medicinal Chemistry |volume=48 |issue=19 |pages=5900–8 |date=September 2005  |pmid=16161994 |doi=10.1021/jm050101d}}</ref> It is a highly selective [[Direct factor Xa inhibitor|direct Factor Xa inhibitor]] with oral [[bioavailability]] and rapid onset of action. Inhibition of Factor Xa interrupts the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of the [[coagulation|blood coagulation cascade]], inhibiting both [[thrombin]] formation and development of thrombi. Rivaroxaban does not inhibit thrombin (activated Factor II), and no effects on [[platelets]] have been demonstrated.<ref name="Xarelto SPC"/> It allows predictable [[anticoagulation]] and dose adjustments and routine coagulation monitoring <ref name="Xarelto SPC"/> as well as dietary restrictions are not needed.<ref name= reuters/>

Unfractionated [[heparin]] (UFH), [[low molecular weight heparin]] (LMWH), and [[fondaparinux]] also inhibit the activity of factor Xa  but indirectly by binding to circulating [[antithrombin]] (AT III) and must be injected. Whereas, the orally active [[warfarin]], [[phenprocoumon]], and [[acenocoumarol]] are [[vitamin K antagonist]]s (VKA) decrease a number of coagulation factors, including Factor X.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Turpie AG |title=New oral anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation |journal=European Heart Journal |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=155–65 | date=January  2008 |pmid=18096568 |doi=10.1093/eurheartj/ehm575}}</ref>

Rivaroxaban has predictable [[pharmacokinetics]] across a wide spectrum of patients (age, gender, weight, race) and has a flat [[Dose-response relationship|dose response]] across an eightfold dose range (5–40&nbsp;mg).<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Eriksson BI, Borris LC, Dahl OE, etal |title=A once-daily, oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor, rivaroxaban (BAY 59-7939), for thromboprophylaxis after total hip replacement |journal=Circulation |volume=114 |issue=22 |pages=2374–81 | date=November  2006 |pmid=17116766 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.642074}}</ref>

==Chemistry==
[[File:Linezolid–rivaroxaban comparison.svg|thumb|left|Chemical structures of [[linezolid]] (top) and rivaroxaban (bottom). The shared structure is shown in blue.]]

Rivaroxaban bears a striking [[chemical structure|structural]] similarity to the antibiotic [[linezolid]]: both drugs share the same [[oxazolidinone]]-derived core structure. Accordingly, rivaroxaban was studied for any possible antimicrobial effects and for the possibility of [[mitochondrial toxicity]], which is a known complication of long-term linezolid use. Studies found that neither rivaroxaban nor its metabolites have any antibiotic effect against [[Gram-positive bacteria]]. As for mitochondrial toxicity, ''in vitro'' studies published before 2008 found the risk to be low.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emea.europa.eu/humandocs/PDFs/EPAR/xarelto/H-944-en6.pdf |title=CHP Assessment Report for Xarelto (EMEA/543519/2008) |author=European Medicines Agency |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-06-11}}</ref>
