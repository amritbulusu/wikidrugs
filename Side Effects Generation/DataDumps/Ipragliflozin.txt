'''Ipragliflozin''' ([[International nonproprietary name|INN]],<ref name="INN">{{cite web | title = International Nonproprietary Names for Pharmaceutical Substances (INN). Recommended International Nonproprietary Names: List 65 | url = http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/druginformation/innlists/RL65.pdf | publisher = World Health Organization}}</ref>{{rp|69}} trade names '''Suglat''') is a pharmaceutical drug for treatment of [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]]. Ipragliflozin, jointly developed by [[Astellas Pharma]] and Kotobuki Pharmaceutical, was approved in [[Japan]] on January 17, 2014.<ref>{{cite web | title = Approval of Suglat<sup>®</sup> Tablets, a Selective SGLT2 Inhibitor for Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes, in Japan | url = https://www.astellas.com/en/corporate/news/pdf/140117_1_Eg.pdf | publisher = Astellas Pharma Inc. | accessdate = 15 November 2016}}</ref>

Ipragliflozin is a [[SGLT2|Sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2)]] inhibitor ([[gliflozin]]).<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Nihon Yakurigaku Zasshi | date = 2015 | volume = 145 | issue = 1 | pages = 36–42 | doi= 10.1254/fpj.145.36 | title = Pharmacological and clinical profile of ipragliflozin (Suglat(®)): a new therapeutic agent for type 2 diabetes |vauthors=Takasu T, Takakura S, Kaku S | pmid=25743234}}</ref> These membrane proteins are on the cell surface and transfer glucose into the cells. SGLT2 is one subtype of SGLTs and plays a key role in the reuptake of glucose in the proximal tubule of the kidneys. Ipragliflozin reduces blood glucose levels by inhibiting the reuptake of glucose by selectively inhibiting SGLT2.<ref>{{cite news|title=Changing Tomorrow|url=https://www.astellas.com/en/ir/library/pdf/2014AR_en_0912.pdf|accessdate=12 November 2016|publisher=Astellas Pharma Inc.|date=31 March 2014}}</ref>

==Clinical trials==
The efficacy and safety of ipragliflozin were both observed in a [[Phases of clinical research#Phase III|Phase III]] study in monotherapy and clinical studies used in combination with other hypoglycemic agents (6 types) in Japan.<ref>{{cite news|title=About Astellas|url=https://www.astellas.com/en/corporate/about/|publisher=Astellas Pharma Inc.|date=2015}}</ref>

One placebo-controlled, double-blind study was carried out at 18 different sites in Korea and 12 in Taiwan. Patients were above 20 and had type 2 diabetes for atlas 12 weeks. They were given an 8-week period to clear their systems of all other drugs (besides metformin). Patients received either 50&nbsp;mg ipragliflozin or a placebo. The drugs were identical in all physical forms. The patients were prohibited from using any other anti diabetic drugs, other than metformin. The study ran for 24 weeks along with a 4-week follow-up period. 
The standard deviation in [[Glycated hemoglobin|hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub>]] were −0.94% and −0.47% in the ipragliflozin and placebo groups, respectively (between-group difference −0.46%, [[p-value|''p'']] <0.001). The changes in fasting plasma glucose and bodyweight were also significantly greater in the ipragliflozin group, with between-group differences of −14.1&nbsp;mg/dL and −1.24&nbsp;kg, respectively (both ''p'' <0.001). The most common adverse events that appeared were [[Upper respiratory tract infection|upper respiratory infection]]s and [[urinary tract infection]]s. From this it was concluded that ipragliflozin is both efficacious as well as safe.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lu|first1=Chieh-Hsiang|last2=Min|first2=Kyung Wan|last3=Chuang|first3=Lee-Ming|last4=Kokubo|first4=Satoshi|last5=Yoshida|first5=Satoshi|last6=Cha|first6=Bong-Soo|title=Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ipragliflozin in Asian patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and inadequate glycemic control with metformin: Results of a phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial|journal=Journal of Diabetes Investigation|date=14 October 2015|volume=7|issue=3|pages=366–373|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jdi.12422/full|accessdate=14 November 2016|doi=10.1111/jdi.12422}}</ref>

However, ipragliflozin is currently in Observational Case Control clinical trial to see the long-term (over three years) safety of using ipragliflozin. The estimated completion of this trial is October 2018.<ref name="ClinicalTrials.gov">{{cite web|title=Specified Drug Use Results Survey of Ipragliflozin Treatment in type2 Diabetes Patients (STELLALONGTERM)|url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02479399|website=ClinicalTrials.gov|publisher=ClinicalTrials.gov|accessdate=10 November 2016}}</ref>

Ipragliflozin was also in development for type 2 diabetes mellitus in the U.S., Europe and other countries, and three phase II trials were completed in combination with metformin. This was since discontinued.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Poole, Dungo|first1=Raewyn, Rosselle|title=Ipragliflozin: First Global Approval|journal=Drugs|volume=74|issue=5|date=26 March 2014|pages=611–617|doi = 10.1007/s40265-014-0204-x|pmid=24668021}}</ref>

==Commercialization==
As of 2014, Suglat was the top reimbursed drug in Japan. Peak sales reached {{USD}}515 million with 800,000 and the cost per patient reached {{USD}}644 per year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Big in Japan?

In 2014, the market for selective SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan was around 9 billion yen. Suglat’s share of this market was around 49%.

In 2015, sales of Suglat grew 77.8% to 7.3 billion [[Japanese yen|yen]], following the availability of long-term prescriptions from May 2015. Suglat's share of the market for selective SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan was around 39%.<ref name = "auto">{{cite news|title=Annual Report 2016|url=https://www.astellas.com/en/ir/ar2016/pdf/2016AR_en.pdf|accessdate=14 November 2016|publisher=Astellas Pharma Inc.|date=31 March 2016}}</ref>

The projected sales in 2016 is to jump all the way to 12.5 billion yen.<ref name="ClinicalTrials.gov"/>

==Marketing==
Ipragliflozin was the first drug of its kind sold by any company in Japan. Therefore, Astellas will focus their marketing in order to maintain the top share of this market that it holds.<ref>{{cite news|title=Annual Report 2015|url=https://www.astellas.com/en/ir/library/pdf/2015AR_en_1007-2.pdf|accessdate=14 November 2016|publisher=Astellas Pharma Inc.|date=31 March 2015}}</ref> Astellas has been building up post-marketing data in regard to the efficacy and safety of ipragliflozin. By supplying information based on this data, Astellas aims to increase the market penetration of ipragliflozin in the Japanese market.

In 2015, Astellas additionally launched Suglat in the Republic of Korea and [[Febuxostat|Feburic]] in Thailand.<ref name="auto"/>{{rp|50}}

==Intellectual Property== 
In May 2013, Boehringer Ingelheim of Germany applied for a Methods of Treatment, Pharmaceutical Compositions and uses thereof patent. This patent application included SGLT2 inhibitor ipragliflozin.<ref>{{cite news|title=United States Patent Application Publication|url=https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/1b6934ed99699fdc212f/US20130137646A1.pdf|accessdate=18 November 2016|date=30 May 2013}}</ref>
In April 2014, Boehringer Ingelheim applied for usage of SGLT2 inhibitors in equine animals. The usage of these inhibitors in an animal study allows for progression in the application in humans for more than just diabetes.<ref>{{cite web|title=United States Patent Application Publication|url=https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/fe21628842c80654fbc7/US20140303096A1.pdf|accessdate=19 November 2016}}</ref>
The National Institute of Biological Science out of Beijing filed a similar patent in September 2015. 
In January 2016, the Dalian University of Technology filed a patent on the synthetic method of ipragliflozin.<ref>{{cite news|title=Synthetic method of Ipragliflozin|url=https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/e6bf09bb38cf3e69502d/CN105541816A.pdf|accessdate=19 November 2016|date=20 January 2016}}</ref>
There are additional patents for the synthesis of the intermediates leading up to these types of inhibitors.
