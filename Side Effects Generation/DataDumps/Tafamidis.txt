Tafamidis was discovered in the [[Jeffery W. Kelly]] Laboratory at [[The Scripps Research Institute]]<ref>Razavi, H.; Palaninathan, S.K. Powers, E.T.; Wiseman, R.L.; Purkey, H.E.; Mohamadmohaideen, N.N.; Deechongkit, S.; Chiang, K.P.; Dendle, M.T.A.; Sacchettini, J.C.; Kelly, J.W.

FoldRx was led by Richard Labaudiniere when it was acquired by [[Pfizer]] in 2010.

Tafamidis functions by kinetic stabilization of the correctly folded [[tetrameric]] form of the [[transthyretin]] (TTR) protein.<ref>Hammarstrom, P.; Wiseman, R. L.; Powers, E.T.; Kelly, J.W. "Prevention of Transthyretin Amyloid Disease by Changing Protein Misfolding Energetics". ''Science'', 2003, 299, 713-716</ref> In patients with FAP, this protein dissociates in a process that is rate limiting for aggregation including [[amyloid]] fibril formation, causing failure of the autonomic nervous system and/or the peripheral nervous system ([[neurodegeneration]]) initially and later failure of the heart. Kinetic Stabilization of tetrameric transthyretin in familial amyloid polyneuropathy patients provides the first pharmacologic evidence that the process of amyloid fibril formation causes this disease, as treatment with tafamidis dramatically slows the process of amyloid fibril formation and the degeneration of post-mitotic tissue. Sixty % of the patients enrolled in the initial clinical trial have the same or an improved neurologic impairment score after six years of taking tafamidis, whereas 30% of the patients progress at a rate ≤ 1/5 of that predicted by the natural history. Importantly, all of the V30M FAP patients remain stage 1 patients after 6 years on tafamidis out of four stages of disease progression.

Neurology]]'', 2013 260, 2802-2814.</ref>
 
The process of wild type transthyretin amyloidogenesis also appears to cause [[wild-type transthyretin amyloid]]osis (WTTA), also known as senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA), leading to [[cardiomyopathy]] as the prominent phenotype.<ref>Westermark, P., Sletten, K., Johansson, B., and Cornwell, G.G., 3rd (1990).

"Tafamidis in transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy: effects on transthyretin stabilization and clinical outcomes." ''[[Circ. Heart. Fail.]]'' 2015 8, 519-526.</ref> this has yet to be demonstrated in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. Pfizer has enrolled a placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the ability of tafamidis to slow the progression of both [[familial amyloid cardiomyopathy]] and [[Wild-type transthyretin amyloid|senile systemic amyloidosis]]  (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01994889).

== Regulatory Process ==

Tafamidis was approved for use in the [[European Union]] by the European Medicines Agency in November 2011, specifically for the treatment of early stage [[transthyretin-related hereditary amyloidosis]] or familial amyloid polyneuropathy or FAP (all mutations). In September 2013 Tafamidis was approved for use in Japan by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, specifically for the treatment of  [[transthyretin-related hereditary amyloidosis]] or familial amyloid polyneuropathy or FAP (all mutations). Tafamidis is also approved for use in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and Israel by the relevant authorities.<ref>http://www.pfizer.com/sites/default/files/news/Brazil%20Approval%20Press%20Statement%2011-7-16_0.pdf</ref> It is currently being considered for approval by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for the treatment of early stage [[transthyretin-related hereditary amyloidosis]] or familial amyloid polyneuropathy or FAP.

In June 2012, the FDA Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee voted  “yes” (13-4 favorable vote) when asked if the findings of the pivotal clinical
study with tafamidis were “sufficiently robust to provide substantial evidence of efficacy for a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit”. The Advisory Committee voted "no" 4-13 to reject the drug–in spite of the fact that both primary endpoints were met in the efficacy evaluable population (n=87) and were just missed in the intent to treat population (n=125), apparently because more patients than expected in the intent to treat population were selected for liver transplantation during the course of the trial, not owing to treatment failure, but because their name rose to the top of the transplant list. However, these patients were classified as treatment failures in the conservative analysis used.
