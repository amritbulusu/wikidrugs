{{Other uses|Substance control (disambiguation)}}
A '''controlled substance''' is generally a drug or chemical whose manufacture, possession, or use is regulated by a government, such as [[illegal drugs|illicitly used drugs]] or [[prescription medication]]s that are designated a [[Controlled Drug in the United Kingdom]].<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/controlled-substances answers.com]</ref>

In the United States, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] is responsible for suppressing illegal drug use and distribution by enforcing the [[Controlled Substances Act]], which regulates both the drugs themselves and certain precursors.  Some U.S. states have additional restrictions for substances which might or might not be regulated by the federal government. During the [[Obama Administration]], the federal government also voluntarily suspended enforcement of federal laws restricting [[marijuana]] where people were operating in compliance with state law.

Some precursor chemicals used for the production of illegal drugs are also controlled substances in many countries, even though they may lack the pharmacological effects of the drugs themselves. Substances are classified according to schedules and consist primarily of potentially psychoactive substances. The controlled substances do not include many prescription items such as antibiotics.<ref>[http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/21usc/index.html Controlled Substance Act]</ref>

Some states in the U.S. have statutes against health care providers self-prescribing and/or administering substances listed in the Controlled Substance Act schedules. This does not forbid licensed providers from self-prescribing medications not on the schedules.
