'''Fimasartan''' is a non-peptide [[angiotensin II receptor antagonist]] (ARB) used for the treatment of [[hypertension]] and [[heart failure]].<ref name="tolerability">Chi, Y., Lee, H., Paik, S., Lee, J.H., Yoo, B.W., Kim, S.L., Hyun, K.T., and Kim, S.L.

American Journal Cardiovascular Drugs.11(5): 335-46.</ref> Through oral administration, fimasartan blocks [[angiotensin II receptor type 1]] (AT<sub>1</sub> receptors), reducing pro-hypertensive actions of [[angiotensin II]], such as systemic vasoconstriction and water retention by the kidneys.<ref name="systemic">DeMello, W.C., and Frohlich, E.D.

== Mechanism of action ==
Fimasartan acts on the kidney’s rennin-angiotensin cascade, which begins when [[renin]] release from the kidney causes the breakdown of [[angiotensinogen]] into [[angiotensin I]]. [[Angiotensin-converting enzyme]] (ACE) then catalyzes the reaction that forms [[angiotensin II]], which acts on AT<sub>1</sub> receptors on the blood vessels, heart, and kidneys.<ref name="burnier">Burnier, M. Angiotensin ll Type 1 Receptor Blockers. (2001). Circulation. 103: 904-912.</ref> On blood vessels, the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor is coupled to an intracellular pathway that causes smooth muscle contraction (vasoconstriction) of blood vessels.<ref name="rat plasma">Soo Shin, B., Kim, T.H., Paik, S., Chi, Y., Joo, H., Tan, H., Choi, Y., Kim, M., and Yoo, S.

At the kidney and adrenal gland, AT<sub>1</sub> blockage and prevention of [[aldosterone]] formation increase excretion of water and salt by the kidneys, which decreases overall [[blood volume]].<ref name="ARBs">Klabunde, Richard E.

ARBs like fimasartan have also shown to be protective against [[stroke]], [[myocardial infarction]], and [[heart failure]].<ref name="neal">Neal, B., MacMahon, S., Chapman, N.

== Side effects ==
Side effects
In clinical trials, fimasartan was well tolerated in all patients. However, higher dosing (360&nbsp;mg/day) was accompanied by increased dizziness (most likely due to the momentary decrease in blood pressure) and headaches in a low number of patients.<ref name="tolerability" /> Other side effects such as diarrhea, syncope, and cold feet were also experienced in a low number of subjects, which all resolved without medical intervention.<ref name="tolerability" />

== Pharmacology ==
Fimasartan is rapidly absorbed and has minimal accumulation in the body 7 days after administration.<ref name="tolerability" /> Fimasartan possesses a [[half-life]] of 9 to 16 hours,<ref name="concurrent" /> appropriate for daily dosing. Fimasartan was found to be effective in fasted or fed states, with a variety of dosing regimens. In trials, the maximum effects of the drug occurred slightly after the maximum plasma concentration ([[T-max]]) was achieved,<ref name="tolerability" /> which occurs 30 minutes to 3 hours after dosing.<ref name="warfarin">Gu, N., Kim, B., Kyoung, S.L., Kim, S.E., Nam, W.S., Yoon, S.H., Cho, J., Shin, S., Jang, I., Yu, K.

(2012). Clinical Therapeutics. 34(7): 1592-1600.</ref> Fimasartan was found mostly in unmetabolized form in the plasma and in [[bile]] excretions. Urinary elimination of the drug was low, at less than 3% 24 hours after administration, entailing that the fimasartan does not undergo renal excretion.<ref name="tolerability" />
