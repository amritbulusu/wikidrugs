'''Phentermine''' (contracted from [[phenyl|<u>phen</u>yl]]-[[Butyl#Nomenclature|<u>ter</u>tiary-butyl]][[amine|a<u>mine</u>]]), also known as '''α,α-dimethylphenethylamine''', is a [[psychostimulant]] [[drug]] of the [[substituted amphetamine]] chemical class, with pharmacology similar to [[amphetamine]]. It is used medically as an [[appetite suppressant]] for short term use, as an adjunct to exercise and reducing calorie intake.

Phentermine may produce cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and [[Central nervous system|CNS]] side effects; rare cases of [[pulmonary hypertension]] and [[cardiac valvular disease]] have been reported.  It should not be used by people who have a history of [[drug abuse]], have [[cardiovascular disease]], [[hyperthyroidism]], [[glaucoma]], or are [[pregnant]], planning to become pregnant, or [[breast-feeding]]. It should not be taken by anyone taking a [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]. Drinking alcohol while using phentermine may cause adverse effects.

It was first introduced in 1959, and became part of the drug combination [[fen-phen]] that was withdrawn from the market in 1997 due to the [[fenfluramine]]  component damaging people's heart valves.  In 2012 a different [[combination drug]], [[phentermine/topiramate]] was approved in the US.

Different formulations of phentermine as a single agent are available under various brand names, in many countries.<ref name=drugs.com/>

==Medical uses==
Phentermine is used for a short period of time to promote weight loss, if exercise and calorie reduction are not sufficient, and in addition to exercise and calorie reduction.<ref name = TGA/><ref name=USlabel/>

Phentermine is approved for up to 12 weeks of use and most weight loss occurs in the first weeks.<ref name="USlabel" /> However, significant loss continues through the sixth month and has been shown to continue at a slower rate through the ninth month.<ref name=Glazer>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Glazer G|date=August 2001|title=Long-term Pharmacotherapy of Obesity 2000|url=http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/751590|journal=Archives of Internal Medicine|language=en|volume=161|issue=15|pages=1814–1824|doi=10.1001/archinte.161.15.1814|issn=0003-9926}}</ref>

==Contraindications==
Phentermine use is [[contraindicated]] in those who:<ref name="TGA" /><ref name=USlabel/>
* have a history of [[drug abuse]].
* are allergic to [[sympathomimetic amine]] drugs.
* are taking a [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]] (MAOI) or have taken one within the last 14&nbsp;days.
* have [[cardiovascular disease]], [[hyperthyroidism]], or [[glaucoma]].
* are [[pregnant]], planning to become pregnant, or [[breast-feeding]].

==Drug interactions==
Phentermine may decrease the effect of drugs like [[clonidine]], [[methyldopa]], and [[guanethidine]]. Drugs to treat [[hypothyroidism]] may increase the effect of phentermine.<ref name=USlabel/>

==Adverse effects==
Rare cases of [[pulmonary hypertension]] and [[cardiac valvular disease]] have been reported.<ref name=USlabel/> Tolerance usually occurs however risks of dependence and addiction are considered negligible.<ref name=Glazer /><ref <ref name=Haslam >{{Cite journal|vauthors=Haslam D|date=February 2016|year=|title=Weight management in obesity – past and present|journal=International Journal of Clinical Practice|volume=70|issue=3|pages=206–217|doi=10.1111/ijcp.12771|issn=1368-5031|pmc=4832440|pmid=26811245}}</ref> People taking phentermine may be impaired when driving or operating machinery.<ref name=USlabel/>  Consumption of alcohol with phentermine may produce adverse effects.<ref name="USlabel" />

There is no evidence that phentermine is safe for women who are pregnant.<ref name="TGA" /><ref name="USlabel" />

Other adverse effects include:<ref name="TGA">{{cite web|title=METERMINE (Phentermine)|date=22 July 2013|accessdate=16 November 2013|work=TGA eBusiness Services|publisher=iNova Pharmaceuticals (Australia) Pty Limited|url=https://www.ebs.tga.gov.au/ebs/picmi/picmirepository.nsf/pdf?OpenAgent&id=CP-2010-PI-06558-3|format=PDF}}</ref><ref name="USlabel">{{cite web|title=Phentermine label at FDA|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/085128s065lbl.pdf|publisher=FDA|accessdate=13 October 2016|format=Last updated: January 2012}}</ref>

* Cardiovascular effects like [[palpitations]], [[tachycardia]], high blood pressure, precordial pain; rare cases of stroke, angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac failure and cardiac arrest have been reported.
* Central nervous system effects like overstimulation, restlessness, nervousness, insomnia, tremor, dizziness and headache; there are rare reports of euphoria followed by fatigue and depression, and very rarely,  psychotic episodes and hallucinations.
* Gastrointestinal effects include nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, cramps, unpleasant taste, diarrhea, and constipation.
* Other adverse effects include trouble urinating, rash, impotence, changes in libido, and facial swelling.

==Mechanism of action==
[[Image:Phentermine.jpg|frame]]
Phentermine has some similarity in its [[pharmacodynamics]] with its parent compound, [[amphetamine]], as they both are [[TAAR1 agonist]]s,<ref name="pmid18524885">{{cite journal |vauthors=Barak LS, Salahpour A, Zhang X, Masri B, Sotnikova TD, Ramsey AJ, Violin JD, Lefkowitz RJ, Caron MG, Gainetdinov RR | title = Pharmacological characterization of membrane-expressed human trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) by a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer cAMP biosensor | journal = Mol. Pharmacol. | volume = 74 | issue = 3 | pages = 585–94 |date=September 2008  | pmid = 18524885 | pmc = 3766527 | doi = 10.1124/mol.108.048884 | quote = we confirmed agonistic activity at human TAAR1 of several other compounds, including the trace amines octopamine and tryptamine, the amphetamine derivatives l-amphetamine, d-methamphetamine, (+)-MDMA, and phentermine, and the catecholamine metabolites 3-MT and 4-MT (Bunzow et al., 2001; Lindemann and Hoener, 2005; Reese et al., 2007; Wainscott et al., 2007; Wolinsky et al., 2007; Xie and Miller, 2007; Xie et al., 2007).}}</ref> where the activation of TAAR1 in [[monoamine]] neurons facilitates the efflux or, release into the synapse, of these neurochemicals; at clinically relevant doses, phentermine primarily acts as a [[releasing agent]] of [[norepinephrine]] in [[neuron]]s, although, to a lesser extent, it releases [[dopamine]] and [[serotonin]] into synapses as well.<ref name=Haslam /><ref name="Rothman">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Rothman RB, Baumann MH, Dersch CM, etal |title=Amphetamine-type central nervous system stimulants release norepinephrine more potently than they dopamine and serotonin |journal=Synapse |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=32–41 |date=January 2001 |pmid=11071707 |doi=10.1002/1098-2396(20010101)39:1<32::AID-SYN5>3.0.CO;2-3 |url=}}</ref>  Phentermine may also trigger the release of monoamines from [[VMAT2]], which is a common [[pharmacodynamic]] effect among [[substituted amphetamine]]s.  The primary mechanism of phentermine's action in treating obesity is the reduction of hunger perception, which is a cognitive process mediated primarily through several nuclei within the [[hypothalamus]] (in particular, the [[lateral hypothalamic nucleus]], [[arcuate nucleus]], and [[ventromedial nucleus]]). Outside the brain, phentermine releases [[norepinephrine]] and [[epinephrine]] – also known as noradrenaline and adrenaline respectively – causing fat cells to break down stored fat as well.

==History==
In 1959, phentermine first received approval from the United States FDA as an appetite-suppressing drug.<ref name="Ryan">{{cite book|last1=Ryan|first1=Donna A.|last2=Bray|first2=George A.|editor1-last=Bray|editor1-first=George A.|editor2-last=Bouchard|editor2-first=Claude|title=Handbook of Obesity - Volume 2 Clinical Applications, Fourth Edition.|date=2014|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=Hoboken|isbn=9781841849829|page=234|edition=4th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=64XOBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA234|chapter=Sibutramine, Phentermine, and Diethylproprion: Sympathomimetic Drugs in the Management of Obesity}}</ref> Eventually a hydrochloride salt and a [[resin]] form became available.<ref name="Ryan" />

Phentermine was marketed with [[fenfluramine]] or [[dexfenfluramine]] as a combination appetite suppressant and fat burning agent under the popular name [[fen-phen]]. In 1997, after 24 cases of heart valve disease in fen-phen users, fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine were voluntarily taken off the market at the request of the FDA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm179871.htm |title=FDA Announces Withdrawal Fenfluramine and Dexfenfluramine (Fen-Phen) |publisher=Fda.gov |date= |accessdate=12 July 2013}}</ref> Studies later showed nearly 30% of people taking fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for up to 24 months had abnormal valve findings.<ref name=2003rev>{{cite journal|last1=Weigle|first1=DS|title=Pharmacological therapy of obesity: past, present, and future.|journal=The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism|date=June 2003|volume=88|issue=6|pages=2462–9|pmid=12788841|doi=10.1210/jc.2003-030151}}</ref>

Phentermine is still available by itself in most countries, including the US.<ref name=Ryan/> However, because it is similar to [[amphetamine]], it is classified as a [[controlled substance]] in many countries. Internationally, phentermine is a schedule IV drug under the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]].<ref>[http://filofetch.com/pdf/Convention-on-Psychotropic-Substances.pdf Convention on Psychotropic Substances (PDF file)]</ref> In the United States, it is classified as a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule IV controlled substances|Schedule IV]] controlled substance under the [[Controlled Substances Act]]. In contrast, amphetamine preparations are classified as Schedule II controlled substances.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rueda-Clausen|first1=CF|last2=Padwal|first2=RS|last3=Sharma|first3=AM|title=New pharmacological approaches for obesity management.|journal=Nature Reviews.

A company called [[Vivus]] developed a [[combination drug]], [[phentermine/topiramate]] that it originally called Qnexa and then called Qsymia, which was invented and used off-label by Thomas Najarian, who opened a weight-clinic in [[Los Osos, California]] in 2001;  Najarian had previously worked at [[Interneuron Pharmaceuticals]], which had developed one of the fen-phen drugs previously withdrawn from the market.<ref name=NYT2012>{{cite news|last1=Pollack|first1=Andrew|title=Diet Treatment, Already in Use, to Get F.D.A.

==Chemistry==

===Synthesis===
Phentermine can be produced from [[benzaldehyde]] and [[2-Nitropropane|2-nitropropane]] as follows:<ref>{{US patent|2408345}}</ref><ref>{{US patent|2590079}}</ref>

# Benzaldehyde and 2-nitropropane are cross-reacted in a variant of the [[Henry reaction]]
# The [[Nitro compound|nitro]] group is reduced with hydrogen gas over [[Raney nickel]] [[catalyst]]
# The hydroxyl group is chlorinated with [[thionyl chloride]] to yield 2-amino-1-chloro-2-methyl-1-phenylpropane
# This is reduced with hydrogen gas over a palladium on [[magnesium glycinate]] catalyst to yield the product, phentermine
