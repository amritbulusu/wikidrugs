'''Mirtazapine''', sold under the brand name '''Remeron''' among others, is an [[atypical antidepressant]] which is used primarily in the treatment of [[depression (mood)|depression]].<ref name="pmid11607047" /> In addition to its [[antidepressant]] properties, mirtazapine has [[anxiolytic]], [[sedative]], [[antiemetic]], and [[appetite stimulant]] effects and is sometimes used in the treatment of [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[insomnia]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], and to produce [[weight gain]] when desirable.<ref name="pmid11607047" /><ref name="pmid12404669">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nutt DJ | title = Tolerability and safety aspects of mirtazapine | journal = Hum Psychopharmacol | volume = 17 Suppl 1 | issue = | pages = S37–41 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12404669 | doi = 10.1002/hup.388 | url = }}</ref> It is taken [[oral administration|by mouth]].

The drug acts as an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of certain [[adrenergic receptor|adrenergic]] and [[serotonin receptor]]s, and is also a strong [[antihistamine]].<ref name="pmid11607047" /> It is sometimes described as a [[noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant]] (NaSSA),<ref name="pmid11607047" /> although the actual evidence in support of this label has been regarded as poor.<ref name="pmid16342227" /> Chemically, mirtazapine is a [[tetracyclic antidepressant]] (TeCA), with four interconnected [[ring (chemistry)|ring]]s of atoms, and is a relative of the TeCA [[mianserin]] (Tolvon).<ref name="pmid17471183" /><ref name="MD" />

===Effectiveness and tolerability===
A 2011 Cochrane review that compared mirtazapine to other antidepressants, found that while it appears to have a faster onset in people for whom it works (measured at 2 weeks), it is about the same as other antidepressants at 6 weeks.<ref name=Cochrane2011>{{cite journal|last1=Watanabe|first1=N|last2=Omori|first2=IM|last3=Nakagawa|first3=A|last4=Cipriani|first4=A|last5=Barbui|first5=C|last6=Churchill|first6=R|last7=Furukawa|first7=TA|title=Mirtazapine versus other antidepressive agents for depression.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=7 December 2011|issue=12|pages=CD006528|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006528.pub2|pmid=22161405|pmc=4158430}}</ref>

A 2012 review focused on antidepressants and sleep found that in many people with sleep disorders caused by depression, mirtazapine reduces the time it takes to fall asleep and increases the quality of sleep, but that in some people it can disturb sleep, causing [[restless leg syndrome]] in 8 to 28% of people, and in rare cases causes [[Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder|REM sleep behavior disorder]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wichniak|first1=A|last2=Wierzbicka|first2=A|last3=Jernajczyk|first3=W|title=Sleep and antidepressant treatment.|journal=Current pharmaceutical design|date=2012|volume=18|issue=36|pages=5802–17|doi=10.2174/138161212803523608|pmid=22681161}}</ref>

In 2010 [[NICE]] published a guideline for treating depression that included a review of antidepressants. It recommended generic [[SSRI]]s as first line choices, as they are "are equally effective as other antidepressants and have a favourable risk–benefit ratio."<ref>{{cite book|title=Pharmacological Interventions: 10.14. Clinical Practice Recommendations|date=2010|publisher=National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health/British Psychological Society|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK63751/#ch10.s159|language=en}}</ref> With respect to mirtazapine, it found: "There is no difference between mirtazapine and other antidepressants on any efficacy measure, although in terms of achieving remission mirtazapine appears to have a statistical though not clinical advantage. In addition, mirtazapine has a statistical advantage over SSRIs in terms of reducing symptoms of depression, but the difference is not clinically important. However, there is strong evidence that patients taking mirtazapine are less likely to leave treatment early because of side effects, although this is not the case for patients reporting side effects or leaving treatment early for any reason."<ref>{{cite book|title=Pharmacological Interventions: Third-Generation Antidepressants: 10.8.3.

==Interactions==
Concurrent use with inhibitors or inducers of the [[cytochrome P450|cytochrome (CYP) P450]] [[isoenzyme]]s [[CYP1A2]], [[CYP2D6]], and/or [[CYP3A4]] can result in altered concentrations of mirtazapine, as these are the main [[enzyme]]s responsible for its metabolism.<ref name="pmid10885584" /><ref name="pmid11607047" /> As examples, [[fluoxetine]] and [[paroxetine]], inhibitors of these enzymes, are known to modestly increase mirtazapine levels, while [[carbamazepine]], an inducer, considerably decreases them.<ref name="pmid10885584" /> [[Liver failure|Liver]] and moderate [[Renal failure|renal impairment]] have been reported to decrease the oral clearance of mirtazapine by about 30%; severe renal impairment decreases it by 50%.<ref name="pmid10885584" />

====α<sub>2</sub>-Adrenergic receptor====
Antagonism of the α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors, which function largely as [[inhibitory postsynaptic potential|inhibitory]] [[autoreceptor]]s and [[heteroreceptor]]s, enhances [[adrenergic]] and [[serotonergic]] [[neurotransmission]], notably [[central nervous system|central]] [[5-HT1A receptor|5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor]] mediated transmission in the [[dorsal raphe nucleus]] and [[hippocampus]]; hence, mirtazapine's classification as a NaSSA. Indirect α<sub>1</sub> adrenoceptor-mediated enhancement of serotonin cell firing and direct blockade of inhibitory α<sub>2</sub> heteroreceptors located on serotonin terminals are held responsible for the increase in extracellular serotonin.<ref name="pmid11607047"/><ref name="pmid10446735"/><ref name="pmid7912194">{{cite journal | vauthors = De Boer T, Nefkens F, Van Helvoirt A | title = The alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist Org 3770 enhances serotonin transmission in vivo | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 253 | issue = 1–2 | pages = R5-6 | date = February 1994 | pmid = 7912194 | doi = 10.1016/0014-2999(94)90778-1 }}{{Unreliable medical source|date=October 2011}}</ref><ref name="pmid9361334">{{cite journal | vauthors = Berendsen HH, Broekkamp CL | title = Indirect in vivo 5-HT1A-agonistic effects of the new antidepressant mirtazapine | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 133 | issue = 3 | pages = 275–82 | date = October 1997 | pmid = 9361334 | doi = 10.1007/s002130050402 }}</ref><ref name="pmid15145142">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakayama K, Sakurai T, Katsu H | title = Mirtazapine increases dopamine release in prefrontal cortex by 5-HT1A receptor activation | journal = Brain Research Bulletin | volume = 63 | issue = 3 | pages = 237–41 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15145142 | doi = 10.1016/j.brainresbull.2004.02.007 }}{{Unreliable medical source|date=October 2011}}</ref> Because of this, mirtazapine has been said to be a functional "[[indirect agonist]]" of the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor.<ref name="pmid9361334"/> Increased activation of the central 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor is thought to be a major mediator of efficacy of most antidepressant drugs.<ref name="pmid11212592">{{cite journal | vauthors = Blier P, Abbott FV | title = Putative mechanisms of action of antidepressant drugs in affective and anxiety disorders and pain | journal = Journal of Psychiatry & Neuroscience | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–43 | date = January 2001 | pmid = 11212592 | pmc = 1408043 | doi = | url = http://www.cma.ca/multimedia/staticContent/HTML/N0/l2/jpn/vol-26/issue-1/pdf/pg37.pdf }}</ref>

===Pharmacokinetics===
The [[oral administration|oral]] [[bioavailability]] of mirtazapine is about 50%. It is found mostly [[plasma protein binding|bound]] to [[plasma protein]]s, about 85%. It is [[metabolism|metabolized]] primarily in the [[liver]] by [[demethylation]] and [[hydroxylation]] via [[cytochrome P450]] [[enzyme]]s. One of its major [[metabolite]]s is desmethylmirtazapine. The overall elimination half-life is 20–40 hours. About 75% is [[elimination (pharmacology)|eliminated]] in [[feces]] and 25% in [[urine]].<ref name=Schatzberg/>{{rp|430}}
