'''Drospirenone''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]), also known as '''1,2-dihydrospirorenone''', is a [[steroid]]al [[progestin]] of the [[spirolactone]] group used in birth control pills and postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy pills.<ref name="Buckingham 1994">{{cite book|editor-last=Buckingham|editor-first=John|year=1994|chapter=Spirorenone, INN S-01057|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4aNJh3pv2UC&pg=PA5201|title=Dictionary of Natural Products, Volume 5, R–Z, R-00001 – Z-00072|location=London|publisher=Chapman & Hall|isbn=0-412-46620-1|page=5201|accessdate=May 28, 2012}}</ref>

It is sold as a [[combined oral contraceptive]] under the brand names '''Yasmin''' (US, EU, Latin America), '''Jasmine''' (France), '''Yarina''' (Russia) <ref>http://www.doz.pl/leki/p8625-Daylette</ref> in a dosage containing drospirenone 3&nbsp;mg/[[ethinylestradiol]] 30&nbsp;µg. In the United States, [[Bayer Schering]] released [[Ethinylestradiol/drospirenone/levomefolic acid|a pill based on Yasmin]] with the B vitamin [[Folic acid|folate]] (B<sub>9</sub>), which is marketed under the names ''Safyral'' and ''Beyaz''.

Worldwide it is also sold under the brand names '''Yaz''' and '''Yasminelle''' in a lower dosage containing drospirenone 3&nbsp;mg/[[ethinylestradiol]] 20&nbsp;µg.

==Medical uses==
Drospirenone is an ingredient in some [[birth control pills]] and [[hormone replacement therapy]]. In combination with [[ethinylestradiol]] it is used as [[contraception]], and for women who want contraception it is also approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) to treat moderate [[acne vulgaris|acne]] and [[premenstrual dysphoric disorder]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Cerner Multum, Inc.|date=June 11, 2012|title=drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol|location=Auckland, New Zealand|publisher=Drugs.com|url=http://www.drugs.com/mtm/drospirenone-and-ethinyl-estradiol.html|accessdate=October 24, 2011}}</ref>

Women who take contraceptive pills containing drospirenone have a six- to sevenfold risk of developing [[thromboembolism]] (dangerous blood clots) compared to women who do not take any contraceptive pill, and have twice the risk (some epidemiological studies suggest thrice, according to the FDA) compared to women who take a contraceptive pill containing [[levonorgestrel]], though the actual risk is small, in the neighborhood of 9 to 27 out of 10,000 women on an oral contraceptive for a year (up to 9 for levonorgestrel vs up to 27 for drospirenone, or about 0.09% vs 0.3% per year.)<ref name="Lidegaard 2011">{{cite journal|last1=Lidegaard|first1=Øjvind|last2=Milsom|first2=Ian|last3=Skovlund|first3=Charlotte Wessel|last4=Skjeldestad|first4=Finn Egil|last5=Løkkegaard|first5=Ellen|date=October 25, 2011|title=Risk of venous thromboembolism from use of oral contraceptives containing different progestogens and oestrogen doses: Danish cohort study, 2001–9|journal=BMJ|volume=343|page=d6423|doi=10.1136/bmj.d6423|pmc=3202015|pmid=22027398|url=http://www.bmj.com/highwire/filestream/448051/field_highwire_article_pdf/0/bmj.d6423.full.pdf|accessdate=November 26, 2011}}</ref>

While all oral contraceptives can increase the risk for [[venous thrombosis|venous thrombembolic events]], including fatal blood clots, several studies have reported a greater risk for women taking contraceptives containing drospirenone.  (Before becoming alarmed at the huge "relative" differences in risk, one must remember that the "actual" risks involved are quite small — in the neighborhood of 1 in 10,000 to 27 in 10,000 in a year).<ref name="Lidegaard 2012">{{cite journal|last1=Lidegaard|first1=Øjvind|last2=Milsom|first2=Ian|last3=Geirsson|first3=Reynir Tomas|last4=Skjeldestad|first4=Finn Egil|date=July 2012|title=Hormonal contraception and venous thromboembolism|journal=Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica|volume=91|issue=7|pages=769–778|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0412.2012.01444.x|pmid=22568831|url=http://www.lidegaard.dk/Publ/12%20Lidegaard%20ACTA.pdf|accessdate=October 22, 2012}}</ref>
 
When the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) became concerned about the risks of drospirenone, they funded studies based on the medical records of more than 800,000 women taking oral contraceptives.  They found that the risk of VTE, which includes dangerous and potentially fatal blood clots, was 93% higher for women who had been taking oral contraceptives made with drospirenone for only 3 months or less and 290% higher for women taking drospirenone oral contraceptives for 7–12 months, compared to women taking other types of oral contraceptives.  To determine the exact risk for women of different ages and different circumstances, further study is warranted.<ref name="Dunn 2011">{{cite journal|last=Dunn|first=Nick|date=April 21, 2011|title=The risk of deep venous thrombosis with oral contraceptives containing drospirenone.

The FDA recently updated the label for contraceptives containing drospirenone to include warnings for stopping use prior to and after surgery, and to warn that contraceptives with drospirenone may have a higher risk of dangerous blood clots.<ref name="Yasmin PI 2012"/>

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Drospirenone binds strongly to the [[progesterone receptor]] (PR) and [[mineralocorticoid receptor]] (MR), with lower [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]], to the [[androgen receptor]] (AR), and very low affinity for the [[glucocorticoid receptor]] (GR).<ref name="pmid7625729" /><ref name="FuhrmannKrattenmacher1996">{{cite journal|last1=Fuhrmann|first1=Ulrike|last2=Krattenmacher|first2=Rolf|last3=Slater|first3=Emily P.|last4=Fritzemeier|first4=Karl-Heinrich|title=The novel progestin drospirenone and its natural counterpart progesterone: Biochemical profile and antiandrogenic potential|journal=Contraception|volume=54|issue=4|year=1996|pages=243–251|issn=0010-7824|doi=10.1016/S0010-7824(96)00195-3}}</ref> It is an [[agonist]] of the PR and an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of the MR and AR, and hence, a [[progestogen]], [[antimineralocorticoid]], and [[antiandrogen]].<ref name="pmid7625729" /> Drospirenone is said to be devoid of any [[estrogen]]ic or [[glucocorticoid]] or [[antiglucocorticoid]] activity.<ref name="pmid7625729" /> It has potent [[antigonadotropic]] effects at sufficient dosages as a result of PR activation.<ref name="pmid7625729" /> It has been regarded that drospirenone has a pharmacological profile that is very closely related to that of natural [[progesterone]], due to the combination of both progestogenic and antimineralocorticoid actions.<ref name="pmid7625729">{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Muhn P, Fuhrmann U, Fritzemeier KH, Krattenmacher R, Schillinger E | title = Drospirenone: a novel progestogen with antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic activity | journal = Ann.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Drospirenone is taken orally with about 76% [[bioavailability]]. It is bound not by [[sex hormone-binding globulin]] or [[Corticosteroid binding protein|corticosteroid binding globulin]], but by other serum proteins. Metabolites have not been shown to be biologically active, show up in urine and feces, and are essentially completely excreted within 10 days.

==Chemistry==
It is an [[analog (chemistry)|analog]] to [[spironolactone]], with a [[molecular weight]]  of 366.5 and the [[molecular formula]] C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>30</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.

==Formulations==
The compound is part of certain newer [[oral contraceptive formulations]]:
* Yasmin/Jamine/Yarina contains 3&nbsp;mg drospirenone and 30&nbsp;mcg [[ethinylestradiol]] per tablet. It is indicated for the prevention of pregnancy in women who elect an oral contraceptive.
* Safyral contains 3&nbsp;mg drospirenone and 30&nbsp;mcg [[ethinylestradiol]] per tablet. It is indicated for the prevention of pregnancy in women who elect an oral contraceptive as well as to provide a daily dose of folate supplementation, which is recommended for women in their reproductive years.� Folate lowers the risk of having rare neural tube birth defects in a pregnancy occurring during Safyral use or shortly after stopping.<ref name="Yasmin/Safyral US Website by Bayer Schering Pharma AG">{{cite web|title=Yasmin/Safyral|url=http://yasmin-us.com/index.html|accessdate=February 9, 2015}}</ref>
