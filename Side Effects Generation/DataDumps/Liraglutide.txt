'''Liraglutide''' (NN2211) is a derivative of human [[incretin]] ([[metabolic]] [[hormone]]) [[glucagon-like peptide-1]] (GLP-1) that is used as a long-acting [[glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist|glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist]], binding to the same receptors as does the [[endogenous]] [[metabolic]] [[hormone]] [[glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist|GLP-1]] that stimulates [[insulin]] secretion.  Marketed under the brand name '''Victoza''', it is an [[Injection (medicine)|injectable drug]] developed by [[Novo Nordisk]] for the treatment of [[type 2 diabetes]]. In 2015, [[Novo Nordisk]] began marketing a separate strength in the U.S. and E.U. under the brand name '''Saxenda''' as a treatment for adults who are obese or overweight with at least one weight-related [[Comorbidity|comorbid]] condition.

===Obesity===
Liraglutide has been approved as an injectable adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adult patients.  The specified criteria are an initial body mass index (BMI) of 30&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup> or greater (obese), or 27&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup> or greater (overweight), in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition (e.g. hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or dyslipidemia).  In late 2014, data were reported from the SCALE™ Obesity and Prediabetes trial,<ref name=SCALE>{{cite web| url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01272219?term=NCT01272219&rank=1| title=Effect of Liraglutide on Body Weight in Non-diabetic Obese Subjects or Overweight Subjects With Co-morbidities: SCALE™—Obesity and Pre-diabetes| publisher=[[ClinicalTrials.gov]]| date=13 November 2014|accessdate=17 January 2015| id=NCT01272219}}</ref> which is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational trial in non-diabetic people with obesity and non-diabetic people who are overweight with comorbidities. In this phase 3a trial, there were 3,731 participants randomised to treatment with liraglutide 3&nbsp;mg or placebo, both in combination with diet and exercise.

==Adverse effects==

===Thyroid cancer concerns===
At exposures eight times greater than those used in humans, liraglutide caused a statistically significant increase in thyroid tumors in rats.  The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.<ref name="www.accessdata.fda.gov">{{cite web |url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2010/022341lbl.pdf |title=www.accessdata.fda.gov |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> In clinical trials, the rate of thyroid tumors in patients treated with liraglutide was 1.3 per 1000 patient years (4 people) compared to 1.0 per 1000 patients (1 person) in comparison groups. The sole person in the comparator group and four of the five persons in the liraglutide group had serum markers (elevated calcitonin) suggestive of pre-existing disease at baseline.<ref name="www.accessdata.fda.gov"/>

The FDA said serum calcitonin, a biomarker of medullary thyroid cancer, was slightly increased in liraglutide patients, but still within normal ranges, and it required ongoing monitoring for 15 years in a cancer registry.<ref>N Engl J Med, 362:774</ref>

===Pancreatitis concerns===
In 2013, a group at [[Johns Hopkins]] reported an apparently statistically significant association between hospitalization for acute pancreatitis and prior treatment with GLP-1 derivatives (such as exenatide) and DPP-4 inhibitors (such as sitagliptin).<ref name=Singh>{{cite journal| title=Glucagonlike Peptide 1–Based Therapies and Risk of Hospitalization for Acute Pancreatitis in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus| authors=Sonal Singh; Hsien-Yen Chang; Thomas M.

In a joint 2014 letter to the New England Journal of Medicine, the agencies concluded that "A pooled analysis of data from 14,611 patients with type 2 diabetes from 25 clinical trials in the sitagliptin database provided no compelling evidence of an increased risk of pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer" and "Both agencies agree that assertions concerning a causal association between incretin-based drugs and pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer, as expressed recently in the scientific literature and in the media, are inconsistent with the current data. The FDA and the EMA have not reached a final conclusion at this time regarding such a causal relationship. Although the totality of the data that have been reviewed provides reassurance, pancreatitis will continue to be considered a risk associated with these drugs until more data are available; both agencies continue to investigate this safety signal."<ref name="FDA-EMA">{{cite journal |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1314078 |title=Pancreatic Safety of Incretin-Based Drugs—FDA and EMA Assessment—NEJM| journal= [[The New England Journal of Medicine]]| date=February 27, 2014|accessdate=January 17, 2015| doi=10.1056/NEJMp1314078 | pmid=24571751 | volume=370 |issue=9| pages=794–7|author1=Egan|first1=A.

==Pharmacodynamics==

Liraglutide is an [[acylated]] [[glucagon-like peptide-1]] (GLP-1) agonist, derived from human GLP-1-(7-37), a less common form of [[endogenous]] GLP-1.

Liraglutide leads to [[insulin]] release in [[pancreatic]] [[beta cells]] in the presence of elevated blood [[glucose]]. This insulin secretion subsides as glucose concentrations decrease and approach euglycemia (normal blood glucose level). It also decreases [[glucagon]] secretion in a glucose-dependent manner and delays [[gastric]] emptying. Unlike [[endogenous]] GLP-1, liraglutide is stable against [[metabolic]] degradation by [[peptidase]]s, with a [[Blood plasma|plasma]] half-life of 13 hours.<ref name="drugs.com"/><ref name= Goldstein/>

==Pharmacokinetics==
Endogenous GLP-1 has a [[Blood plasma|plasma]] [[half-life]] of 1.5–2 minutes due to degradation by the ubiquitous [[enzymes]], [[dipeptidyl peptidase-4]] (DPP4) and [[neutral endopeptidase]]s (NEP).  The half-life after intramuscular injection is approximately half an hour, so even administered this way, it has limited use as a therapeutic agent.  The metabolically active forms of GLP-1 are the [[endogenous]] GLP-1-(7-36)NH<sub>2</sub> and the more rare GLP-1-(7-37). The prolonged action of liraglutide is achieved by attaching a [[fatty acid]] molecule at one position of the GLP-1-(7-37) molecule, enabling it to both self-associate and bind to [[albumin]] within the [[subcutaneous tissue]] and bloodstream. The active GLP-1 is then released from albumin at a slow, consistent rate. Albumin binding also results in slower degradation and reduced [[renal]] elimination compared to that of GLP-1-(7-37).<ref name= Goldstein/>

==Society and culture==

===Brand names===
Liraglutide is marketed under the brand name Victoza in the U.S., U.K. UAE, India, Iran, Canada, Europe and Japan. It has been launched in Germany, Italy, Denmark, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden, Japan, Canada, the United States, Brazil, France, Malaysia and Singapore.  Liraglutide is also known to be marketed as Saxenda in Australia, Canada and the U.S.

===Marketing===
Novo Nordisk stated that it plans to use 500 of its 3,000-strong sales force in the United States to promote Saxenda in 2015, because it is considered to have the potential for sales of $1 billion a year within 8–10 years of launch around the world.  Analysts at [[Citigroup#Institutional Clients Group|Citi Research]] concur, assuming that the drug will reach less than 0.5 percent of the 107 million people in the United States classified as obese, and a daily price of $30 over 6 to 12 months' use. The company estimates that it has spent about $1 billion over ten years to take Saxenda from research to marketing.<ref name=reuters/>

===Controversy===
In 2010, Novo Nordisk breached the [[Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry|ABPI's]] code of conduct by failing to provide information about side effects of Victoza, and by promoting Victoza prior to being granted market authorization.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pmcpa.org.uk/?q=node/878|title=Novo Nordisk Limited, Eli Lilly and Company Limited, Grünenthal Ltd and Napp Pharmaceuticals Limited named in advertisements|publisher=Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority (PMCPA)|accessdate=2011-02-07}}</ref>

In 2012, the non-profit consumer advocacy group [[Public Citizen]] petitioned the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) to immediately remove liraglutide from the market because they concluded that risks of [[thyroid cancer]] and [[pancreatitis]] outweigh any documented benefits.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.citizen.org/pressroom/pressroomredirect.cfm?ID=3586|title=Public Citizen to FDA: Pull Diabetes Drug Victoza From Market Immediately|publisher=Public Citizen|accessdate=2013-04-02}}</ref>

==Research==
