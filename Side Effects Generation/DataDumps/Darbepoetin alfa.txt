'''Darbepoetin alfa''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) {{IPAc-en|d|ɑːr|b|ə|ˈ|p|oʊ|ᵻ|t|ᵻ|n}} is a re-engineered form of [[erythropoietin]] containing 5 amino acid changes (N30, T32, V87, N88, T90) resulting in the creation of 2 new sites for N-linked carbohydrate addition. It has a 3-fold longer serum half-life compared to epoetin alpha and epoetin beta. It stimulates [[erythropoiesis]] (increases [[red blood cell]] levels) by the same mechanism as rHuEpo (binding and activating the Epo receptor) and is used to treat [[anemia]], commonly associated with [[chronic renal failure]] and cancer [[chemotherapy]]. Darbepoetin is marketed by [[Amgen]] under the trade name '''Aranesp'''.

The drug was approved in September 2001 by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] for treatment of anemia in patients with chronic renal failure by intravenous or subcutaneous injection.<ref>{{cite web

[[Dr. Reddy's Laboratories]] launched darbepoetin alfa in India under the brand name ‘Cresp’ in August 2010. This is the world’s first follow-on biologic of darbepoetin alfa.

Darbepoetin is produced by [[recombinant DNA]] technology in modified [[Chinese hamster ovary cell]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=R E|last2=Jaiyesimi|first2=I A|last3=Meza|first3=L A|last4=Tchekmedyian|first4=N S|last5=Chan|first5=D|last6=Griffith|first6=H|last7=Brosman|first7=S|last8=Bukowski|first8=R|last9=Murdoch|first9=M|last10=Rarick|first10=M|last11=Saven|first11=A|last12=Colowick|first12=A B|last13=Fleishman|first13=A|last14=Gayko|first14=U|last15=Glaspy|first15=J|title=Novel erythropoiesis stimulating protein (NESP) for the treatment of anaemia of chronic disease associated with cancer|journal=British Journal of Cancer|date=16 June 2001|volume=84|issue=s1|pages=24–30|doi=10.1054/bjoc.2001.1749|url=http://www.nature.com/bjc/journal/v84/n1s/full/6691749a.html|accessdate=31 October 2014}}</ref> It differs from endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) by containing two more N-linked oligosaccharide chains.  It is an erythropoiesis-stimulating 165-[[amino acid]] [[protein]].

==Contraindications==
Use of darbepoetin alfa is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug, pre-existing uncontrolled hypertension, and pure red cell aplasia.<ref name="Lexi">"Darbepoetin Alfa (Lexi-Drugs)". LexiComp. Retrieved 29 October 2014.</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Darbepoetin alfa has [[Boxed warning|black box warnings]] in the United States for increased risk of [[death]], [[myocardial infarction]], [[stroke]], [[venous thromboembolism]], [[thrombosis]] of vascular access, and [[tumor]] progression or recurrence. To avoid side effects, it is recommended for patients with chronic renal failure or cancer to use the lowest possible dose needed to avoid red blood cell (RBC) [[Blood transfusion|transfusions]].<ref name=PI>{{cite web|title=Prescribing Information: Aranesp ® (darbepoetin alfa) injection, for intravenous or subcutaneous use|url=http://pi.amgen.com/united_states/aranesp/ckd/aranesp_pi_hcp_english.pdf|publisher=Amgen Inc. Thousand Oaks, CA|accessdate=3 November 2014}}</ref>

In addition to those listed in the black box warning, use of darbepoetin alfa also increases the risk of cardiovascular problems, including [[cardiac arrest]], arrhythmia, [[hypertension]] and  [[congestive heart failure]], and [[edema]].<ref name="Lexi"/> A recent study has extended these findings to treatment of patients exhibiting cancer-related anemia (distinct from anemia resulting from chemotherapy).<ref>{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Pollack

==Pregnancy and lactation==
Darbepoetin alfa is a Pregnancy Category C drug in the United States.<ref name="Lexi"/> Pregnant women who are taking darbepoetin alfa may enroll in Amgen’s Pregnancy Surveillance Program (800-772-6436).<ref name="PI"/>

It is not known if darbepoetin alfa is excreted in breast milk. Mothers who choose to breast-feed are advised to use caution.<ref name="Lexi"/>

==Mechanism of action==
Darbepoetin alfa binds to the [[erythropoietin receptor]] on [[erythroid progenitor cells]], stimulating RBC production and differentiation.<ref name="Lexi"/>

==Safety advisories in anemic cancer patients==
Amgen sent a "dear doctor" letter in January, 2007, that highlighted results from a recent anemia of cancer trial, and warned doctors to consider use in that off-label indication with caution.

Amgen advised the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as to the results of the [[DAHANCA]] 10 clinical trial.  The DAHANCA 10 data monitoring committee found that 3-year loco-regional control in subjects treated with Aranesp was significantly worse than for those not receiving Aranesp (p=0.01).

In response to these advisories, the FDA released a [[Public Health Advisory]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/advisory/RHE2007.htm |title=FDA Public Health Advisory: Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents (ESAs): Epoetin alfa (marketed as Procrit, Epogen), Darbepoetin alfa (marketed as Aranesp) |accessdate=2007-06-05 |work= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528103823/http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/advisory/RHE2007.htm |archivedate=2007-05-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>
on March 9, 2007, and a clinical alert<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/InfoSheets/HCP/RHE2007HCP.htm |title=Information for Healthcare Professionals: Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA) |accessdate=2007-06-05 |work= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515034509/http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/InfoSheets/HCP/RHE2007HCP.htm |archivedate=2007-05-15 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> for doctors on February 16, 2007, about the use of [[Erythropoiesis-stimulating agent|erythropoeisis-stimulating agents (ESAs)]] such as [[epoetin alfa]] (marketed as Epogen) and darbepoetin alfa.  The advisory recommended caution in using these agents in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy or off chemotherapy, and indicated a lack of clinical evidence to support improvements in quality of life or transfusion requirements in these settings.

According to the 2010 update to clinical practice guidelines from the [[American Society of Clinical Oncology]] (ASCO) and the [[American Society of Hematology]] (ASH), use of ESAs such as darbepoetin alfa in cancer patients is appropriate when following stipulations outlined in FDA-approved labeling.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rizzo |first1=J.

==Society and culture==
Like EPO, darbepoetin alfa has the potential to be abused by athletes seeking a competitive advantage. Its use during the [[2002 Winter Olympic Games]] to improve performance led to the disqualification of [[cross-country skiing (sport)|cross-country skiers]] [[Larisa Lazutina]] and [[Olga Danilova]] of Russia and [[Johann Mühlegg]] of Spain from their final races.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McGrath|first1=Matt|last2=Portal|first2=Gaetan|title=New drugs give cheats the edge|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1789625.stm|accessdate=3 November 2014|agency=BBC News|date=30 January 2002}}</ref>

==Economics==
Epogen and Aranesp had more than $6 billion in combined sales in 2006. Procrit sales were about $3.2 billion in 2006.
