'''Levacetylmethadol''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]), '''levomethadyl acetate''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]), '''OrLAAM''' (trade name) or levo-α-acetylmethadol ('''LAAM''')<ref>US Patent 2565592</ref> is a synthetic [[opioid]] similar in structure to [[methadone]]. It has a long duration of action due to its active [[metabolites]]. It was approved in 1993 by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] for use in the treatment of [[Drug addiction|opioid dependence]]. In 2001, levacetylmethadol was removed from the European market due to reports of life-threatening [[ventricular arrhythmia|ventricular rhythm disorders]].<ref>EMEA April 19, 2001 [http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Public_statement/2009/12/WC500018335.pdf EMEA Public Statement on the Recommendation to Suspend the Marketing Authorisation for Orlaam (Levacetylmethadol) in the European Union]</ref> In 2003, Roxane Laboratories, Inc. discontinued Orlaam in the US.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm153332.htm US FDA Safety Alerts: Orlaam (levomethadyl acetate hydrochloride)] Page Last Updated: Aug 20, 2013</ref>

==Indications==
LAAM is indicated as a second-line treatment for the treatment and management of [[Drug addiction|opioid dependence]] if patients fail to respond to drugs like [[methadone]] or [[buprenorphine]]. Before August 1993, LAAM was classified as a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule I controlled substances|schedule I]] drug in the United States. LAAM is not approved for use in [[Australia]] and [[Canada]].  At present, it is a Schedule II Narcotic controlled substance in the United States with a DEA ACSCN of 9648 and a national aggregate annual manufacturing quota of 4 grammes as of 2013.

==Chemistry and pharmacology==
Levacetylmethadyl acts as a [[mu-opioid receptor]] [[agonist]]. It also acts as a potent, [[noncompetitive]] [[alpha-3 beta-4 nicotinic receptor|α<sub>3</sub>β<sub>4</sub>]] neuronal [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]] [[nicotinic antagonist|antagonist]].<ref name="urlBlockade of Rat α3β4 Nicotinic Receptor Function by Methadone, Its Metabolites, and Structural Analogs — JPET">{{cite web | url = http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/299/1/366.abstract | title = Blockade of Rat α3β4 Nicotinic Receptor Function by Methadone, Its Metabolites, and Structural Analogs — JPET | work = | accessdate = }}</ref>

Levomethadyl acetate is the ''levo'' isomer of α-methadyl acetate. The ''dextro'' isomer, ''d''-[[alphacetylmethadol]], is more potent but shorter acting. The ''levo'' isomer is also less toxic with an {{LD50}} in mice of 110&nbsp;mg/kg s.c. and 172.8&nbsp;mg/kg orally as opposed to {{LD50}}s of 61&nbsp;mg/kg s.c. and 118.3&nbsp;mg/kg orally for ''dl''-α-methadyl acetate. It has a [[melting point]] of 215 °C and a [[molecular weight]] of 353.50. β-methadyl acetate also exists, however it is more [[toxic]] and less active than α-methadyl acetate and has no current medical use.

Levomethadyl acetate undergoes extensive first-pass [[metabolism]] to the active demethylated metabolite nor-LAAM, which is further demethylated to a second active metabolite, dinor-LAAM. These [[metabolites]] are more potent than the parent drug.

==Dosing==
LAAM is used as an [[mouth|oral]] [[solution]] of levomethadyl acetate [[hydrochloride]] at a concentration of 10&nbsp;mg/mL in bottles of 120 and 500 mL under the brand name Orlaam. The first dose of LAAM for patients who have not started treatment with [[methadone]] is 20–40&nbsp;mg. The first dose for patients who have been receiving [[methadone]] will be a little higher than the amount of methadone that was being taken every day, but not more than 120&nbsp;mg. Afterwards, the dosage may be adjusted as needed. Unlike methadone, which requires daily administration, LAAM is administered two to three times a week.
