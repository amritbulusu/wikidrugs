== History ==
Arena Pharmaceuticals Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company founded in 1997 and located in San Diego, California. Arena focused on discovering drugs that act on G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The company developed technology it called Constitutively Activated Receptor Technology (CART) that identified drug leads targeting GPCRs and other classes of receptors to. CART was used to identify drug leads able to act as receptor inhibitors to decrease a biological response or act as receptor activators to increase a biological response.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FilingID=827520&RcvdDate=6/5/2001&CoName=ARENA%20PHARMACEUTICALS%20INC&FormType=S-1&View=html|title=NASDAQ {{!}} SEC Filing|website=secfilings.nasdaq.com|access-date=2017-05-25}}</ref>

The company has one drug on the market, Belviq ([[lorcaserin]]), a weight-loss medication. The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved [[lorcaserin]] on June 27, 2012. The company commtitted to a sales force commitment of 200.<ref>{{Cite press release|title = FDA approves Belviq to treat some overweight or obese adults|date = June 27, 2012|publisher = US FDA|url = http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm309993.htm|accessdate = January 3, 2014|deadurl = no}}</ref> Lorcaserin is approved for use in adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or greater, which is considered obese, or adults with a BMI of 27 or greater and who have at least one weight-related health condition, such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or high cholesterol. However, sales of Belviq were disappointing. In 2015 the company laid off 80 workers; this was followed in July 2016 by the layoff of another 100 employees (approximately 73% of remaining workforce).<ref name = "Meiling" /> In January 2017 Arena announced that it is selling Belviq to its Japanese partner, Eisai Co.

The sale completes a pivot in emphasis toward drugs still under development.
