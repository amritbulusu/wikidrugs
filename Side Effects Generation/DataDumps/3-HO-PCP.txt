==Chemistry==
3-HO-PCP is an [[arylcyclohexylamine]].<ref name="pmid24678061" /> Close [[structural analog|analogue]]s of 3-HO-PCP include PCP, [[3-MeO-PCP]], [[4-MeO-PCP]], [[3-MeO-PCMo]], and somewhat more distantly [[ketamine]], [[methoxyketamine]], [[3-MeO-PCE]], and [[methoxetamine]].<ref name="pmid24678061" />

==Society and culture==

===Legal status===

====United Kingdom====
On October 18, 2012 the [[Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs]] in the [[United Kingdom]] released a report about [[methoxetamine]], saying that the "harms of methoxetamine are commensurate with [[Class B drug|Class B]] of the [[Misuse of Drugs Act of 1971|Misuse of Drugs Act (1971)]]", despite the fact that the act does not classify drugs based on harm. The report went on to suggest that all analogues of MXE should also become class B drugs and suggested a catch-all clause covering both existing and unresearched arylcyclohexamines, including 3-HO-PCP.<ref name='ACMD MXE report'>{{ cite web | url = https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/advisory-council-on-the-misuse-of-drugs-acmd-methoxetamine-report-2012 | title = (ACMD) Methoxetamine Report (2012) | accessdate = 2015-06-24 | date = 2012-10-18 | format = PDF | pages = 14 | work = UK Home Office}}</ref>

====United States====
3-HO-PCP is automatically a [[controlled substance]] in the [[United States]] under the [[Federal Analogue Act]] as a close [[structural analog|analogue]] of PCP.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}
