'''MMDA''' ('''3-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyamphetamine'''; '''5-methoxy-MDA''') is a [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] and [[entactogen]] [[drug]] of the [[substituted amphetamine|amphetamine]] class. It is an [[structural analog|analogue]] of [[lophophine]], [[3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine|MDA]], and [[MDMA]].

MMDA was described by [[Alexander Shulgin]] in his book ''[[PiHKAL]]''. Shulgin lists the dosage range of MMDA as 100–250&nbsp;mg. The first symptoms appear within 30–60 minutes following [[Wiktionary:oral|oral administration]]. MMDA produces [[euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]] and loving warmth, and attenuates feelings such as [[anxiety]] and [[loneliness]]. MMDA also produces eyes-closed [[Mental image|visuals]], a state of [[drowsiness]], [[muscle relaxant|muscle relaxation]], and [[time dilation]]. [[Adverse drug reaction|Side effects]] include moderate [[mydriasis]], [[dizziness]], sensations of [[hot flashes|heat or cold]], and [[trembling]]. The [[imagery analysis|imagery]] is generally realistic, and often related to everyday [[perception]] of people, landscapes, or objects. The effects of MMDA usually reach a [[peak experiences|peak]] during the first hour following the initial symptoms, and begin to wane during the second hour, and usually completely disappear by the end of the fifth hour.

== Psychotherapeutic actions ==
In his 1973 book, ''The Healing Journey'', [[Claudio Naranjo]] explored the [[psychotherapeutic]] potential of MMDA. Like MDA, he found that MMDA facilitates [[communication]] and suggested it has potential applications in [[psychotherapy]]. Worldwide {{As of|2005|lc=on}}, MMDA has not been approved for any human applications.

== Pharmacology ==
MMDA has been shown to act as a non-[[neurotoxic]] [[serotonin releasing agent]] with no effects on [[dopamine]] release and probably [[norepinephrine]] release as well,<ref name="pmid1829838">{{cite journal |vauthors=McKenna DJ, Guan XM, Shulgin AT | title = 3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) analogues exhibit differential effects on synaptosomal release of 3H-dopamine and 3H-5-hydroxytryptamine | journal = Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Behavior | volume = 38 | issue = 3 | pages = 505–12 |date=March 1991 | pmid = 1829838 | doi = 10.1016/0091-3057(91)90005-M| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0091-3057(91)90005-M}}</ref> and as a [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor]] [[agonist]].<ref name="pmid17203365">{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang Z, An L, Hu W, Xiang Y | title = 3D-QSAR study of hallucinogenic phenylalkylamines by using CoMFA approach | journal = Journal of Computer-aided Molecular Design | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 145–53 |date=April 2007 | pmid = 17203365 | doi = 10.1007/s10822-006-9090-y }}</ref> The latter property is responsible for its [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] effects, whereas the former mediates its [[Mood (psychology)|mood]]-lifting and [[empathogenic]] effects.

== Legal Status ==

===United States===
MMDA is classified as a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule I drugs|Schedule 1]] substance in the United States, and is similarly controlled in other parts of the world. Internationally, MMDA is a Schedule I drug under the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/green.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051205125434/http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/green.pdf |archivedate=2005-12-05 |df= }}</ref>

===Australia===
MMDA is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the [[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons|Poisons Standard]] (October 2015).<ref name="Poisons Standard">Poisons Standard October 2015 https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2015L01534</ref> A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.<ref name="Poisons Standard" />
