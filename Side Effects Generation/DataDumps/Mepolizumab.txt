'''Mepolizumab''' (trade name '''Nucala''') is a [[humanized antibody|humanized]] [[monoclonal antibody]] used for the treatment of severe [[eosinophilic asthma]]. It recognizes and blocks [[interleukin-5]] (IL-5), a signalling protein of the immune system.

==Medical uses==
Mepolizumab is approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for the maintenance treatment of severe asthma in patients aged 12 years or older and with an eosinophilic phenotype in combination with other medicines used to treat asthma.<ref name="FDA">{{cite news|title=FDA approves Nucala to treat severe asthma |publisher=FDA|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm471031.htm |date=4 Nov 2016}}</ref>
In Europe it is approved as an add-on treatment for severe refractory eosinophilic asthma in adult patients.<ref name="EPAR-summary">{{cite web|publisher=European Medicines Agency| title=Nucala EPAR Summary for the public |url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Summary_for_the_public/human/003860/WC500198039.pdf|date=December 2015}}</ref>

In studies, mepolizumab cut the necessity for hospitalisation due to asthma [[exacerbation]]s in half, as compared to [[placebo]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Meta-analysis of asthma-related hospitalization in mepolizumab studies of severe eosinophilic asthma|journal=The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology|pmid=27726946|doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2016.08.008|year=2016|author1=Yancey|first1=S.

==Side effects==
Common side effects in clinical trials included headache (19% of patients under mepolizumab treatment versus 18% under placebo), reactions at the site of injection (8% versus 3%), infections of the [[urinary tract]] (3% versus 2%) and the [[lower respiratory tract]], [[eczema]] and muscle spasms (both 3% versus <1%).<ref name="SPC">{{cite web|publisher=European Medicines Agency| title=Nucala Summary of Product Characteristics |url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Product_Information/human/003860/WC500198037.pdf|date=December 2015}}</ref><ref name="Drugs.com">{{drugs.com|pro|nucala}} for Nucala.</ref>

==Overdose==
Single doses of 15 times the usual therapeutic dose have been tolerated in studies without significant side effects.<ref name="SPC" /><ref name="Drugs.com" />

==Interactions==
No interaction studies have been conducted. As with other monoclonal antibodies, the interaction potential is considered to be low.<ref name="SPC" />

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===
Mepolizumab binds to IL-5 and prevents it from binding to [[Interleukin-5 receptor|its receptor]], more specifically the [[interleukin 5 receptor alpha subunit]], on the surface of [[eosinophil]] white blood cells. While eosinophils play a role in inflammation associated with asthma, the exact mechanism of mepolizumab is unknown.<ref name="Drugs.com" />

===Pharmacokinetics===
After [[subcutaneous injection]], mepolizumab has an estimated [[bioavailability]] of 80% and reaches highest blood plasma concentrations after four to eight days. Like other antibodies, it is degraded by [[proteolytic enzyme]]s. Its [[biological half-life]] is 20 days on average, ranging from 16 to 22 days in different individuals.<ref name="SPC" /><ref name="Drugs.com" />

==Chemistry==
The substance is an [[IgG1|IgG<sub>1</sub>]] kappa monoclonal antibody, the two [[immunoglobulin heavy chain|heavy chain]]s consisting of 449 amino acids each, and the two [[immunoglobulin light chain|light chain]]s consisting of 220 amino acids each. The protein part has a molar mass of about 146 [[kDa]], and the sugar part of 3 kDa.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=European Medicines Agency| title=Nucala European Public Assessment Report|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Public_assessment_report/human/003860/WC500198038.pdf|page=10|date=24 September 2015}}</ref>

==History==
Phase III clinical trials in severe eosinophilic asthma were completed in 2014. The FDA approved it in November 2015.<ref name="FDA" /> The [[European Commission]] granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union on 2 December 2015.<ref name="EPAR-summary" />

==Research==
Mepolizumab has been investigated or is under investigation for the treatment of [[atopic dermatitis]], [[hypereosinophilic syndrome]] (HES), [[eosinophilic esophagitis]] (EoE), [[nasal polyposis]], [[eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis]] (EGPA) and [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD).
