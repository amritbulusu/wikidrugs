== Dosage ==

=== Parkinson's disease ===
Administration of piribedil should be initiated with one sustained-release tablet (50&nbsp;mg) daily during the first week. Dosage should then be gradually increased every week until achieving the optimal therapeutic dose:
* as monotherapy: three to five tablets in three to five doses daily.
* in combination with <small>L</small>-DOPA therapy: one to three tablets daily.

=== Other indications ===
One tablet daily at the end of the main meal. In severe cases: two tablets daily in two doses.

== Adverse effects==
* Minor [[gastrointestinal]] upset ([[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[flatulence]], etc.) in predisposed individuals, or when taken between meals: adjust dosage individually, and/or add [[domperidone]];
* [[Orthostatic hypotension]] or [[drowsiness]] may occur, particularly in predisposed individuals (underlying condition or causative illness);
* Mild [[dizziness]], confusion and feeling "drunk" also may occur.

As with other dopamine agonists (like [[pramipexole]] and [[ropinirole]]), compulsive behavior like [[Problem gambling|pathological gambling]], overeating, [[Oniomania|excessive shopping]], increased [[libido]], sexual and/or other intense urges, may develop.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Tschopp L. |author2=Salazar Z. | title = Impulse control disorder and piribedil: report of 5 cases. | journal = Clin.

== Interactions ==
[[Dopamine antagonist]]s reduce the effect of piribedil.

== Overdose ==
At very high doses, piribedil has an emetic action on the [[chemoreceptor trigger zone]] (CTZ). Tablets will thus be rapidly rejected, which explains why no data are currently available concerning the risk of overdosage.

== Receptor affinities ==
* [[Dopamine receptor]] [[agonist]], selective for subtypes D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub>.
* [[Dopamine receptor]] [[antagonist]], selective for subtypes D<sub>4</sub>.<ref name="Arnsten">{{cite news|title=Piribedil|last=Arnsten et al., 2000; Nagaraja and Jayashree, 2001}}</ref><ref name="39875/1021571">{{cite journal | author = ADRIAN NEWMAN-TANCREDI, DIDIER CUSSAC, VALE´ RIE AUDINOT, JEAN-PAUL NICOLAS, FRE´ DE´ RIC DE CEUNINCK, JEAN-A.
