Noracymethadol is an acetyl ester of [[methadol]] and it can be said with some precision that it is either the [[heroin]] or [[6-monoacetylmorphine]] analogue of methadol, and being a methadol it exhibits optical isomerism.  The other methadols (acetylmethadol, methadol &c) have at least four optical isomers (see [[Orlaam]]).
