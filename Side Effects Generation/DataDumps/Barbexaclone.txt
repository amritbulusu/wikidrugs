'''Barbexaclone''' ('''Maliasin''') is a salt compound of [[phenobarbital]] and [[levopropylhexedrine]]. It was introduced in 1983. It has been reported to be as effective as phenobarbital but better tolerated; however, as of 2004, these "promising results" had not yet been confirmed nor denied in controlled trials. 

==Potency==
100 mg of barbexaclone is equivalent to 60 mg of phenobarbital. {{cn|date=May 2017}}
