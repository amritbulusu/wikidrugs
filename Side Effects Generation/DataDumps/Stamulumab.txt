'''Stamulumab''' (MYO-029<ref name="Wyeth Pipeline">[http://www.wyeth.com/research/pipeline Wyeth Product Pipeline], [[Wyeth]], Website accessed April 22, 2007</ref>) is an experimental [[myostatin]] inhibiting drug developed by [[Wyeth|Wyeth Pharmaceuticals]] for the treatment of [[muscular dystrophy]] (MD). Stamulumab was formulated and tested by Wyeth in [[Collegeville, Pennsylvania]].<ref name="NCT00104078">[[NIH]]'s [[ClinicalTrials.gov]], [http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00104078?order=6 Study Evaluating MYO-029 in Adult Muscular Dystrophy], record last updated January 24, 2007</ref> Myostatin is a [[protein]] that inhibits the growth of muscle tissue, stamulumab is a [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] human [[antibody]] designed to bind to and inhibit the activity of myostatin.<ref>medicalnewstoday.com, [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=20441 Wyeth Initiates Clinical Trial with Investigational Muscular Dystrophy Therapy MYO-029], Article Date: 28 Feb 2005 - 7:00 PDT</ref>

Stamulumab is a [[G1 phase|G1]] [[immunoglobulin]] antibody which binds to myostatin and prevents it from binding to its target site, thus inhibiting the growth-limiting action of myostatin on muscle tissue.  Research completed in 2002 found that Stamulumab might one day prove to be an effective treatment for [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]]<ref name="MDA 112702">[http://www.mdausa.org/news/021127micedmd.html Blocking Myostatin Proves Beneficial in Mice with DMD], MDA Research News, 27 November 2002</ref>

==Phase 1 and 2 trials==
Wyeth undertook a Phase 1 and 2 [[clinical trial]] in 2005 and 2006 of stamulumab. The multiple ascending dose trial (36 patients per [[cohort study|cohort]]) contained some measures of efficacy. The trial's participants included people afflicted with [[Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy]], [[Becker's muscular dystrophy]], and [[Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy]]. Through 2007 Wyeth had been analyzing the results but the hoped-for news and/or a publication in 2007 did not occur.<ref name="NCT00104078"/><ref name="being analyzed">[http://www.mda.org/research/061204myo_029_nov06.html Wyeth Analyzing MYO-029 Results], [[Muscular Dystrophy Association]] announcement, December 4, 2006</ref><ref name="FSHWatch 2007">[http://www.fshsociety.org/fsh/FSHSociety_FSHWatchNewsletterSummer2007.pdf FSH Watch Newsletter], pg 11, [[FSH Society]], Summer 2007</ref> In January 24, 2008, Wyeth announced that the study had been accepted by a peer-reviewed journal and publication was expected "in the next few months".<ref name="Wiredsciencejan08">[http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/01/pharma-company.html Pharma Company Responds to WiSci on Muscle-Building Drug], Wired Science, [[Alexis Madrigal]], January 24, 2008, 2008, 4:26:27 PM</ref> The publication appeared in [[Annals of Neurology]] in May 2008.<ref name="AnnNeurol2008">[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18335515 A phase I/IItrial of MYO-029 in adult subjects with muscular dystrophy.], Ann Neurol. 2008 May;63(5):561-71.</ref>

On 11 March 2008 it was announced that Wyeth would not develop the drug further for MD, but would continue to explore myostatin inhibition along with other strategies.<ref>[http://www.mda.org/research/080311md_myo-029.html Wyeth Won't Develop MYO-029 for MD]</ref>

Not belonging to the antibody class of molecules, the ACVR2B protein drug is rather mimicking myostatin's endogenous binding partner, therefore competing for its binding affinity.<ref name="MDA 010606">[http://www.mdausa.org/research/060106myostatin_blocker.html New Myostatin Blocker Makes Mouse Muscles 60 Percent Larger], [[Muscular Dystrophy Association|MDA]] Research News, January 6, 2006</ref>
