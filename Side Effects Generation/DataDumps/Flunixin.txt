'''Flunixin''' is a [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] (NSAID), [[analgesic]], and [[antipyretic]] used in horses, cattle and pigs. It is often formulated as the [[meglumine]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]].  In the United States, it is regulated by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), and may only be lawfully distributed by order of a licensed veterinarian. There are many trade names for the product.

==Dosage and uses in horses==
Flunixin is administered at a dose of 1.1&nbsp;mg/kg.<ref name="McIlwraith">McIlwraith CW, Frisbie DD, Kawcak CE. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs. Proc. AAEP 2001 (47): 182-187.</ref> The full analgesic and antipyretic effects usually occur 1–2 hours following treatment, but there is often an effective analgesic effect within approximately 15 minutes. Despite its short [[biological half life|plasma half life]] of 1.6-2.5 hours, effects can persist for up to 30 hours,<ref>May SA, Lees P. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In McIlwraith CW, Trotter GW, eds. Joint disease in the horse. Philadelphia: WB Saunders, 1996;223–237.</ref> with maximal effects occurring between 2 and 16 hours. This is likely due to accumulation of the drug at inflammatory foci. Flunixin is primarily eliminated by the kidneys.<ref>Soma, L R (11/01/1988). "Disposition and excretion of flunixin meglumine in horses". American journal of veterinary research (0002-9645), 49 (11), p. 1894.</ref>

Because it targets the inflamed tissue, flunixin is mainly used for [[colic]] pain, musculoskeletal pain, and ocular pain.<ref name="Foreman 2012">Foreman, J. H., Bergstrom, B. E., Golden, K.

Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine, 25: 1127–1133. doi: 10.1111/j.1939-1676.2011.0763.x</ref> It is also used as an [[antipyretic]] and to reduce the effects of [[endotoxemia]].<ref>Bryant, C.E., Farnfield, B.A. & Janicke, H.J. (2003) Evaluation of theability of carprofen and flunixin meglumine to inhibit activation ofnuclear factor kappa B. American Journal of Veterinary Research, 64,211–215.</ref>

==Side effects and precautions==
Flunixin is labeled for no more than 5 days of consecutive use and prolonged use increases the risk of toxicity. In horses, this includes [[equine gastric ulcer syndrome|gastric ulcers]],<ref>Videla, R. & Andrews, F.M. (2009) New perspectives in equine gastriculcer syndrome. The Veterinary Clinics of North America. Equine Practice, 25, 283–301.</ref> right dorsal colitis,<ref>McConnico, R.S., Morgan, T.W., Williams, C.C., Hubert, J.D. & Moore, R.M. (2008) Pathophysiologic effects of phenylbutazone on the rightdorsal colon in horses. American Journal of Veterinary Research, 69,1496–1505.</ref> and [[nephrotoxicity]].<ref>Black, H.E. (1986) Renal toxicity of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Toxicologic Pathology, 14,83–90.</ref>

Flunixin is a prohibited substance under [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports]] rules,<ref>{{cite web|title=FEI Prohibited Substances List|url=http://www.fei.org/fei/cleansport/ad-h/prohibited-list|accessdate=23 January 2016}}</ref> and its use is prohibited or restricted by many other equestrian organizations. At labeled dose (1.1&nbsp;mg/kg) given IV, detection time was found to be 144 hours.<ref>{{cite web|title=FEI List of Detection Times|url=http://www.fei.org/system/files/FEI%20detection%20times%20lab%202015.pdf|accessdate=23 January 2016}}</ref> However, drug recycling from bedding contamination by treated horses has been shown to potentially increase the clearance time.<ref>POPOT, M. A., GARCIA, P. and BONNAIRE, Y. (2011), Doping control in horses: housing conditions and oral recycling of flunixin by ingestion of contaminated straw. Journal of Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics, 34: 612–614. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2885.2011.01276.x</ref>

==Administration==
Flunixin may be given orally as a paste or as granules in feed. It can also be used intramuscularly (IM) or intravenously (IV). However, it is very irritating to tissue and IM administration has been associated with [[gas gangrene|myonecrosis]] in horses,<ref>Peek SF, Semrad SD, Perkins GA. Clostridial myonecrosis in horses (37 cases 1985–2000). Equine Vet J 2003;35:86–92</ref> so IV administration is preferred.

Administration of [[phenylbutazone]] to a horse also receiving flunixin has been shown to increase the risk of toxicity without improving analgesia.<ref>FOREMAN, J. H. and RUEMMLER, R. (2011), Phenylbutazone and flunixin meglumine used singly or in combination in experimental lameness in horses. Equine Veterinary Journal, 43: 12–17. doi: 10.1111/j.2042-3306.2011.00485.x</ref><ref>Reed, S.K., Messer, N.T., Tessman, R.K. and Keegan, K.G. (2006) Effects of phenylbutazone alone or in combination with flunixin meglumine on blood protein concentrations in horses. Am. J. vet. Res. 67, 398-402.</ref> For this reason, concurrent administration with another NSAID is not recommended. Doubling the dose of flunixin produces no improvement in analgesia, while potentially increasing the risk of toxicity.<ref name="Foreman 2012" />

In the US, the only labeled route for flunixin administration in cattle is intravenous.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} This is not the case in other countries; for example, in the UK, Allevenix is licensed for IV and intramuscular use,<ref name="NOAH1">{{cite web|title=Allevinix 50 mg/ml solution for injection for cattle, pigs and horses|url=http://www.noahcompendium.co.uk/?id=-453339|website=NOAH Compendium|publisher=National Office of National Health|accessdate=19 April 2017}}</ref> and a pour-on product also exists.<ref name="NOAH2">{{cite web|title=Finadyne Transdermal 50 mg/ml pour-on solution for cattle|url=http://www.noahcompendium.co.uk/?id=-454763|website=NOAH Compendium|publisher=National Office of National Health|accessdate=19 April 2017}}</ref>
