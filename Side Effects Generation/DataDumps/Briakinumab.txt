'''Briakinumab''' ('''ABT-874''') is a human [[monoclonal antibody]] being developed by [[Abbott Laboratories]] for the treatment of [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[inflammatory bowel disease]], and [[multiple sclerosis]]. As of 2011 drug development for [[psoriasis]] has been discontinued in the U.S. and Europe.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pharmatimes.com/article/11-01-17/Abbott_withdraws_briakinumab_applications_in_USA_Europe.aspx|title=Abbott withdraws briakinumab applications in USA, Europe|publisher=PharmaTimes|date=17 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417091156/http://www.pharmatimes.com/article/11-01-17/Abbott_withdraws_briakinumab_applications_in_USA_Europe.aspx|archivedate=17 April 2011|df=}}</ref>

Like [[ustekinumab]], the antibody targets the [[interleukin]]s [[Interleukin 12|12]] and [[Interleukin 23|23]].<ref>{{Cite journal

==Discovery==
The candidate drug was discovered by [[Cambridge Antibody Technology]] in collaboration with Abbott.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abbott.com/static/content/microsite/annual_report/2007/pharmaceuticals.html |title=Abbott 2007 Annual Report: Pharmaceuticals |publisher=Abbott.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731071321/http://www.abbott.com/static/content/microsite/annual_report/2007/pharmaceuticals.html |archivedate=2010-07-31 |df= }}</ref><ref>[http://www.medimmune.com/research_partnering.aspx MedImmune: External R&D Partnering]</ref>

==Trials==
{{as of|2009|11}}, Phase III [[clinical trial]]s for plaque psoriasis<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00570986|A Study Comparing the Safety and Efficacy of Two Dosing Regimens of ABT-874 to Placebo in Subjects With Moderate to Severe Chronic Plaque Psoriasis}}</ref><ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00691964|Study Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of ABT-874 to Etanercept and Placebo in Subjects With Moderate to Severe Chronic Plaque Psoriasis}}</ref> and a Phase II trial for multiple sclerosis<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00086671|Safety and Effectiveness of Two Doses of ABT-874 as Compared to Placebo in Subjects With Multiple Sclerosis (MS)}}</ref> have been completed, and a Phase II trial for [[Crohn's disease]] is underway.<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00562887|Dose Ranging Study Comparing the Efficacy, Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Intravenous Infusions of ABT-874 vs Placebo in Subjects With Active Crohn's Disease}}</ref>

Briakinumab was compared to [[etanercept]] and [[placebo]] in several [[double-blind]] trials. The [[Psoriasis Area Severity Index]] (PASI) was reduced significantly better than under the comparator treatments. 81–82% of patients under briakinumab, 40–56% under etanercept, and 7% under placebo reached PASI reduction of at least 75%.<ref>[http://www.abbott.com/global/url/pressRelease/en_US/60.5:5/Press_Release_0909.htm Abbott Press Release: Abbott Reports Psoriasis Phase III Results of its Investigational IL-12/23 Inhibitor Briakinumab (ABT-874)]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124021238/http://www.abbott.com/global/url/pressRelease/en_US/60.5%3A5/Press_Release_0909.htm |date=November 24, 2010  }}</ref> No head-to-head studies against ustekinumab, the other IL-12/23 inhibitor, are available.

On January 15, 2011, Abbott announced the withdrawal of its application to the US FDA and European regulators for briakinumab.  Following feedback from regulatory authorities indicating the need for further analysis, including the potential for additional studies, Abbott withdrew its applications and was evaluating next steps including possible resubmission at a later date.  This compound has never been resubmitted for approval.

==Royalties==
This is the second candidate from a deal with Cambridge Antibody Technology that Abbott have taken to late-stage clinical trials. As a result of the protracted royalty dispute over [[Humira]] Abbott agreed to pay CAT a reduced royalty of 4.75% on any future sales of ABT-874, from which CAT will pay a portion to the MRC and other licensors (according to CAT's 1997 agreement with the MRC).<ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Cambridge+Antibody+Technology+and+Abbott+Agree+Regarding+Royalties.-a0137937381 The Free Library: Cambridge Antibody Technology and Abbott Agree Regarding Royalties]</ref>
