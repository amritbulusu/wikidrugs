<!-- Definition and medical uses -->
'''Adalimumab''', sold under the [[trade name]] '''Humira''' among others, is a medication used to treat [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[psoriatic arthritis]], [[ankylosing spondylitis]], [[Crohn's disease]], [[ulcerative colitis]], chronic [[psoriasis]], [[hidradenitis suppurativa]], and [[juvenile idiopathic arthritis]]. In rheumatoid arthritis, adalimumab has a response rate similar to [[methotrexate]], and in combination, it nearly doubles the response rate of methotrexate alone.<ref name="AAFP">[http://www.aafp.org/afp/2008/1215/p1406.html Adalimumab (Humira) for the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis], BETH WELCH, Am Fam Physician. 2008 Dec 15;78(12):1406-1408.</ref>

<!-- Side effects and mechanism -->
Adalimumab is a [[TNF inhibitor|TNF-inhibiting]], [[anti-inflammatory]], [[Biopharmaceutical|biologic medication]]. It binds to [[tumor necrosis factor-alpha]] (TNFα), which normally binds to TNFα receptors, leading to the inflammatory response of [[autoimmune disease]]s. By binding to TNFα, adalimumab reduces this inflammatory response. Because TNFα is also part of the [[immune system]], which protects the body from infection, treatment with adalimumab may increase the risk of infections. 

<!-- Society and culture -->
Humira costs approximately $4370 per month(2017), like the TNFα inhibitor [[etanercept]]. From 2012 to US patent expiry in 2016, Humira led the list of top-selling pharmaceutical products, and in 2016, it had $16 billion of global sales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/the-lists/the-top-15-best-selling-drugs-of-2016/77900868|title=The Top 15 Best-Selling Drugs of 2016 - The Lists - GEN Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News - Biotech from Bench to Business - GEN|website=GEN}}</ref> Also in 2014, in India, the first adalimumab [[biosimilar]] came to market at a price of $200.

== Medical uses ==

Adalimumab is administered by [[subcutaneous injection]].<ref name="FPI">{{cite web|url=http://www.rxabbvie.com/pdf/humira.pdf|title=Humira - Full prescribing information|publisher=}}</ref> For most indications, the maintenance treatment is an injection every other week.<ref name="FPI" />

Like other [[Tumor necrosis factors|TNF]] inhibitors—such as [[infliximab]], [[etanercept]], [[certolizumab pegol]], and [[golimumab]]—it may be used to treat several conditions where the suppression of the immune response is desired. Not all of the listed applications have been approved worldwide. 

=== Rheumatoid arthritis ===

Adalimumab has been shown to reduce the signs and symptoms of moderate to severe [[rheumatoid arthritis]] (RA) in adults. It has also been shown to have efficacy in moderate to severe polyarticular [[juvenile idiopathic arthritis]] (JIA) in children 4 and older, and is approved for the treatment of that condition. In RA, it has been approved for use alone, or with [[methotrexate]] or similar medicines, in the U.S. since 2002.<ref>{{cite web | first = Jay P., M.D., FACP | last = Siegel | website = Center for Drug Evaluation and Research | title = Therapeutic Biologic Applications (BLA) – Humira Approval Letter 12/31/02 | accessdate = 2014-02-04 | url = http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ApprovalApplications/TherapeuticBiologicApplications/ucm128218.htm }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Humira® (Adalimumab) - 2011023-Humira.pdf | accessdate = 2014-02-04 | format = PDF | url = http://www.akdae.de/Arzneimitteltherapie/NA/Archiv/2011023-Humira.pdf }}</ref>

[[File:Components of a Adalimumab-Humira pen - annotated.jpg|thumbnail|Components of a Humira [[autoinjector]] pen. See file details for explanation of parts.]]
Because adalimumab suppresses TNF, which is part of the immune system, latent infections such as [[tuberculosis]] can be reactivated, and the immune system may be unable to fight new infections. This has led to fatal infections in some patients.<ref>Karen M. Frank, et al, Investigation of the cause of death in a gene-therapy trial, N Engl J Med 361:161, July 9, 2009</ref>

After a number of studies and reports of adverse events in patients receiving adalimumab—including serious and sometimes fatal blood disorders; serious infections, including tuberculosis and infections caused by viruses, fungi, or bacteria; rare reports of [[lymphoma]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdable.com/advanced_aers_query/c92ac23d3e2c43d72f398360cda8ce5c |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710232946/http://www.fdable.com/advanced_aers_query/c92ac23d3e2c43d72f398360cda8ce5c |archivedate=2011-07-10 |df= }}</ref> and [[Neoplasm|solid tissue cancers]]; rare reports of serious [[liver]] injury; rare reports of [[demyelinating]] [[central nervous system]] disorders; and rare reports of cardiac failure—the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a [[black box warning]] to doctors, which appears in the product labeling of adalimumab and other TNF-inhibiting drugs, instructing them to screen and monitor potential patients more carefully.<ref name=medguide>FDA label – http://www.rxabbott.com/pdf/humira_medguide.pdf</ref> [[Anaphylaxis]] or other serious allergic reactions may also occur.<ref name=medguide />

== History ==
Adalimumab was the first fully human [[monoclonal antibody]] approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]. It was derived from [[phage display]]<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Brekke OH |author2=Sandlie I |title=Therapeutic antibodies for human diseases at the dawn of the twenty-first century |journal=Nat Rev Drug Discov |volume=2 |pages=52–62 |date=January 2003 |doi=10.1038/nrd984 |url=http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v2/n1/full/nrd984.html |issue=1 |pmid=12509759}}</ref> and was discovered through a collaboration between BASF Bioresearch Corporation (a unit of [[BASF]] based in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]) and [[Cambridge Antibody Technology]]. Initially named D2E7,<ref name="Kempeni99">{{cite journal |author =Kempeni J |date=January 1999 |title=Preliminary results of early clinical trials with the fully human anti-TNFα monoclonal antibody D2E7 |journal=Ann Rheum Dis |volume=58 |issue=suppl 1 |pages=I70–2 |pmid=10577977 |doi=10.1136/ard.58.2008.i70 |url=http://ard.bmj.com/content/58/suppl_1/I70.full |pmc=1766582}}</ref> it was then further manufactured at BASF Bioresearch Corporation, developed by BASF Knoll (BASF Pharma), and ultimately manufactured and marketed by [[Abbott Laboratories]] after Abbott's acquisition of BASF Pharma. On January 1, 2013, Abbott split into two companies, one retaining the Abbott name and the other named [[AbbVie]]. Humira is now owned by AbbVie.

Adalimumab was discovered as a result of a collaboration between BASF Bioresearch Corporation and [[Cambridge Antibody Technology]], which began in 1993.<ref>[http://www.cambridgeantibody.com/home/news_and_resources/news_archive/2003/cambridge_antibody_technology__humira]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Cambridge Antibody Technology website</ref> The brand name Humira stands for "'''hu'''man '''m'''onoclonal antibody '''i'''n '''r'''heumatoid '''a'''rthritis".

It was the third [[TNF inhibitor]], after infliximab and etanercept, to be approved in the United States. It was constructed from a fully human [[monoclonal antibody]], while infliximab is a mouse-human [[Chimera (protein)|chimeric]] antibody and etanercept is a TNF receptor-IgG [[fusion protein]].

The drug candidate was discovered initially using CAT's phage display technology and named D2E7.<ref name=Kempeni99 /> The key components of the drug were found by guiding the selection of human antibodies from phage display repertoires to a single epitope of an antigen TNF alpha.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Jespers LS, Roberts A, Mahler SM, Winter G, Hoogenboom HR |title=Guiding the selection of human antibodies from phage display repertoires to a single epitope of an antigen |journal=Biotechnology (N.Y.) |volume=12 |issue=9 |pages=899–903 |date=September 1994|pmid=7521646 |doi=10.1038/nbt0994-899 }}</ref> The ultimate clinical candidate, D2E7, was created and manufactured at BASF Bioresearch Corporation and taken through most of the drug development process by BASF Knoll, then further development, manufacturing and marketing by [[Abbott Laboratories]], after Abbott acquired the pharmaceutical arm of BASF Knoll.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.basf.us/corporate/news2000/newsknoll_pharma_121500.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212013858/http://www2.basf.us/corporate/news2000/newsknoll_pharma_121500.html |archivedate=2013-02-12 }}</ref>

On 2 January 2013, Abbott Laboratories separated into two independent companies, Abbott and AbbVie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abbott.com/press-release/abbott-completes-separation-of-researchbased-pharmaceuticals-business.htm|title=Abbott MediaRoom - Press Releases|work=abbott.com}}</ref> As a result, AbbVie is taking responsibility for the further development and marketing of Humira.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abbvie.com/products/home.html|title=AbbVie - Pharmaceutical Products|work=abbvie.com}}</ref>

As of 2008, adalimumab had been approved by the FDA for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, moderate to severe chronic psoriasis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Although only approved for ulcerative colitis from late 2012 by the FDA in the disease's management, it had been used for several years in cases that have not responded to conventional treatment at standard dosing for Crohn's disease.

=== Royalty litigation ===

In March 2003, Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT) stated its wish to "initiate discussions regarding the applicability of the royalty offset provisions for Humira" with Abbott Laboratories in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] of [[London]]. In November 2004, the trial began, and in December 2004, Justice [[Hugh Laddie]] ruled for CAT. 

A short version of the full statement of the proceedings was released.<ref>http://www.chandb.com/MBE/assessment_041220_CaT_Abbott_judgement_summary.doc{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In it Justice Laddie remarked, "Abbott was in error when it made its first royalty payment to CAT calculated on the basis that only 2% of the Net Sales was due. It should have calculated on the basis of the full royalty of just over 5% and should have paid and continued to pay CAT accordingly." Justice Laddie went on to observe "...that the construction advanced by Abbott does violence to the language of the agreements, renders them obscure and makes little or no commercial sense. For this reason CAT wins the action."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4112235.stm | work=BBC News | title=Biotech firm wins royalty fight | date=2004-12-20 | accessdate=2010-04-23}}</ref>

Abbott was required to pay CAT US$255 million, some of which was to be passed to its partners in development.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2924694/Drug-maker-CAT-surges-after-royalty-settlement.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Drug maker CAT surges after royalty settlement | first=Rosie | last=Murray- | date=2005-10-27 | accessdate=2010-04-23}}</ref> Of this sum, the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] received US$191M, and in addition, Abbott was asked to pay the MRC a further US$7.5M over five years from 2006, providing that Humira remains on the market. The MRC also is to receive a further £5.1M (sterling) in respect of past royalties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrctechnology.org/resources/PR/MRC_Humira_PRESS_RELEASE.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627194553/http://www.mrctechnology.org/resources/PR/MRC_Humira_PRESS_RELEASE.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-27 |df= }}</ref>
