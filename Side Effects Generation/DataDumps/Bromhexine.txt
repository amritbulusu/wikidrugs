'''Bromhexine''' is a [[mucolytic]] (expectorant) agent used in the treatment of [[respiratory system|respiratory]] disorders associated with viscid or excessive [[mucus]].  In addition, bromhexine has [[antioxidant]] properties.<ref name="CDoPA">{{cite book |last=Morton |first=Ian |author2=Hall, Judith |title=Concise Dictionary of Pharmacological Agents |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mqaOMOtk61IC&pg=PA55 |accessdate=2009-06-03 |year=1999 |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-7514-0499-3 |page=55}}</ref>

==Function==
Bromhexine is intended to support the body's mechanisms for clearing [[mucus]] from the [[respiratory tract]].

It is secretolytic, increasing the production of [[serous]] mucus in the respiratory tract and makes the [[phlegm]] thinner and less [[viscous]]. This contributes to a [[secretomotoric]] effect by helping the [[cilia]] transport the phlegm out of the [[lungs]]. For this reason it is often added to [[antitussive|cough syrups]].

Bromhexine is a synthetic derivative of the herbal active ingredient [[vasicine]]. It has been shown to increase the proportion of serous bronchial secretion, making it more easily [[expectorant|expectorated]]. It is indicated as "secretolytic therapy in bronchopulmonary diseases associated with abnormal mucus secretion and impaired mucus transport".

Bromhexine is contained in various formulations, high and low strength syrups 8&nbsp;mg/5&nbsp;ml, 4&nbsp;mg/5&nbsp;ml, tablets and soluble tablets (both with 8&nbsp;mg bromhexine) and solution for oral use 10&nbsp;mg/5&nbsp;ml, adapted to the need of the patients. The [[posology]] varies with the age and weight, but there are products for all age groups from infant on. Bromhexine is well established and tolerated.

Sometimes it is replaced by its metabolite [[ambroxol]], as in Mucosolvan or Mucoangin.
