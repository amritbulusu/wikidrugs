==Uses==
Chloroxylenol is used in hospitals and households for disinfection and sanitation. It is also commonly used in [[antibacterial soap]]s, wound-cleansing applications and household antiseptics such as Dettol liquid (to which it contributes its distinctive odor), cream and ointments.<ref name=Ascenzi>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tFPW4D70BmgC&pg=PA265 | title = Handbook of disinfectants and antiseptics | chapter = Chloroxylenol: an old-new antimicrobial | first = Joseph M. | last = Ascenzi | isbn = 978-0-8247-9524-5 | year = 1996 | publisher = M.

==Side effects==
Chloroxylenol is not significantly [[toxic]] to [[human]]s, is practically non-toxic to birds, and is moderately toxic to freshwater invertebrates.  It is highly toxic to [[fish]] and [[cats]] and should not be used around them.<ref>[http://www.drugs.com/uk/dettol-liquid-spc-10132.html Dettol liquid at drugs.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924045837/http://www.drugs.com/uk/dettol-liquid-spc-10132.html |date=2015-09-24 }}</ref> It is a mild [[skin]] [[irritation|irritant]] and may trigger [[allergic]] reactions in some individuals.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=K Verma|first1=Ghanshyam|last2=K Mahajan|first2=Vikram|last3=Shanker|first3=Vinay|last4=Ram Tegta|first4=Geeta|last5=Jindal|first5=Nidhi|last6=Minhas|first6=Samridhi|title=Contact depigmentation following irritant contact dermatitis to chloroxylenol (dettol)|journal=Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol|date=2011|volume=77|pages=612-4|url=http://www.ijdvl.com/article.asp?issn=0378-6323;year=2011;volume=77;issue=5;spage=612;epage=614;aulast=Verma|accessdate=14 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016202058/http://ijdvl.com/article.asp?issn=0378-6323%3Byear%3D2011%3Bvolume%3D77%3Bissue%3D5%3Bspage%3D612%3Bepage%3D614%3Baulast%3DVerma|archivedate=16 October 2011|df=}}</ref>

===Humans===
Chloroxylenol has the potential for causing lethal [[toxicity]]. It is [[poisonous]] when [[ingested|swallowed]] and even when it is unintentionally [[inhaled|breathed in]].

In a case report, a 42-year-old British man died from Dettol overexposure in May 2007.  He had "obsessive cleaning disorder" and used to keep buckets of Dettol around his flat with rooms littered with Dettol. The [[autopsy]] was not able to conclude whether the lethal exposure to Dettol was via ingestion or inhalation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/05/29/dettol_man/ |title='Dettol Man' cleans himself to death |date=29 May 2007 |author=Lester Haines |publisher=The Register |accessdate=2 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330101307/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/05/29/dettol_man/ |archivedate=30 March 2013 |df= }}</ref> A medical study which analyzed 177 cases of Dettol intoxications via ingestion in [[Hong Kong]] concluded that ″Dettol poisoning resulted in serious complications in 7% of patients, including death".<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.hkmj.org/system/files/hkm1208p270.pdf |title=Dettol poisoning and the need for airway intervention |author1=PK Lam |author2=CK Chan |author3=ML Tse |author4=FL Lau |date=August 2012 |journal=Hong Kong Medical Journal |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=270&ndash;275 |pmid=22865169 |accessdate=29 March 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402121406/http://www.hkmj.org/system/files/hkm1208p270.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df= }}</ref>

===Animals===
Chloroxylenol is toxic to many animals, especially cats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://icatcare.org/advice/cats-and-poisons|title=Cats and poisons|work=icatcare.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150831054415/http://icatcare.org/advice/cats-and-poisons|archivedate=2015-08-31|df=}}</ref>  Phenols are of particular concern because cats are unable to eliminate the toxins following ingestion. A cat may swallow the product by licking its paws after they have come into contact with it.

In [[Australia]], chloroxylenol spray has been shown to be lethal to [[cane toad]]s, an [[invasive species]] that was introduced from [[Hawaii]] as a result of bad judgment in 1935. It had been hoped that the amphibian would control the [[cane beetle]] but it became highly destructive within the ecosystem. Spraying the disinfectant at close range has been shown to cause rapid death to toads. It is not known whether the toxins are persistent or whether they harm other Australian flora and fauna.

Owing to concerns over potential harm to other Australian wildlife species, the use of chloroxylenol as an agent for [[pest control]] was banned in Western Australia by the [[Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia)|Department of Environment and Conservation]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/cane-toad-poison-banned/story-e6frg12c-1225715177178 |title=Cane toad poison banned |date=23 May 2009 |author=Narelle Towie |publisher=Perth Now |accessdate=2 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115231500/http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/cane-toad-poison-banned/story-e6frg12c-1225715177178 |archivedate=15 January 2013 |df= }}</ref>

==History==
Soon after it was created 'parachlorometaxylenol' was then called 'PCMX', but this was thought to be a horrible name and it was renamed 'Dettol' Then in 1930s it was marketed in England, and then in 1932 in India. It had a white on green bottle, similar to medicine bottles. Also it had a white sword similar to the Dr's symbol of a cross.<ref name="Pinto">{{cite web|last1=Susan Pinto|first1=Viveat|title=40 years ago...And now: Not just germs, Dettol fights rivals unabated|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/management/40-years-ago-and-now-not-just-germs-dettol-fights-rivals-unabated-115031201150_1.html|publisher=www.business-standard.com|accessdate=12 July 2017|date=12 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330213646/http://www.business-standard.com/article/management/40-years-ago-and-now-not-just-germs-dettol-fights-rivals-unabated-115031201150_1.html|archivedate=30 March 2017|df=}}</ref><ref>C.S.G.

==Society and culture==
A number of brand names are available.  Chloroxylenol is the active ingredient in Dettol.  It comprises 4.8% of Dettol's total [[Mixture|admixture]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/spcpil/documents/spcpil/con1412920124477.pdf |title=Summary of Product Characteristics / Dettol Liquid |date=22 November 2010 |publisher=MHRA |accessdate=9 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20150108224624/http%3A//www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/spcpil/documents/spcpil/con1412920124477.pdf |archivedate=8 January 2015 |df= }}</ref> with the rest made up by [[pine oil]], [[isopropanol]], [[castor oil]], soap and [[water]].
