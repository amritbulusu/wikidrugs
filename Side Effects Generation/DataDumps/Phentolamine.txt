'''Phentolamine''' (Regitine) is a reversible<ref name="isbn0-7817-4266-8">{{cite book |author1=Jewell, John R. |author2=Longworth, David L. |author3=Stoller, James K. |author4=Casey, David |title=The Cleveland Clinic internal medicine case reviews |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |year=2003 |isbn=0-7817-4266-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |page=32}}</ref> nonselective α-[[adrenergic antagonist]].<ref>{{MeshName|Phentolamine}}</ref>

==Mechanism==
Its primary action is [[vasodilation]] due to α<sub>1</sub> blockade.<ref>Brock G. Oral phentolamine (Vasomax). ''Drugs Today (Barcelona)''. 2000 Feb-Mar;36(2-3):121-4.</ref>

Non-selective α-blockers can cause a much more pronounced reflex [[tachycardia]] than the selective [[Alpha-1 blocker|α<sub>1</sub> blockers]]. Like the selective α<sub>1</sub> blockers, phentolamine causes a relaxation of systemic vasculature, leading to [[hypotension]]. This hypotension is sensed by the [[Baroreflex|baroreceptor reflex]], which results in increased sympathetic nerve firing on the heart, releasing [[norepinephrine]]. In response, the [[Beta-1 adrenergic receptor|β<sub>1</sub> adrenergic receptors]] on the heart increase its [[Heart rate|rate]], [[Myocardial contractility|contractility]], and [[Dromotropic|dromotropy]], which help to offset the decrease in systemic blood pressure. Unlike the α<sub>1</sub> selective blockers, phentolamine also inhibits the α<sub>2</sub> receptors, which function predominantly as [[Chemical synapse|presynaptic]] [[negative feedback]] for norepinephrine release. By abolishing this negative feedback phentolamine leads to even less regulated norepinephrine release, which results in a more drastic increase in heart rate.<ref name=pharmnemonics>{{Cite book | author=Shen, Howard | title=Illustrated Pharmacology Memory Cards: PharMnemonics | year=2008 | publisher=Minireview | isbn=1-59541-101-1 | page=14}}</ref>

==Uses==
The primary application for phentolamine is for the control of [[hypertensive emergency|hypertensive emergencies]], most notably due to [[pheochromocytoma]].<ref>Tuncel M, Ram VC. Hypertensive emergencies. Etiology and management. ''American Journal of Cardiovascular Drugs''. 2003;3(1):21-31.</ref>

It also has usefulness in the treatment of [[cocaine]]-induced cardiovascular complications, where one would generally avoid [[Beta blocker|β-blocker]]s (e.g. [[metoprolol]]), as they can cause unopposed α-adrenergic mediated [[Coronary vasospasm|coronary vasoconstriction]], worsening myocardial ischemia and hypertension. It is important to note that phentolamine is not a first-line agent for this indication. Phentolamine should only be given to patients who do not fully respond to [[benzodiazepine]]s, [[nitroglycerin]], and [[calcium channel blocker]]s.<ref>Hollander JE, Henry TD. Evaluation and management of the patient who has cocaine-associated chest pain. ''Cardiology Clinics''. 2006 Feb;24(1):103-14.</ref><ref>Chan GM, Sharma R, Price D, Hoffman RS, Nelson LS. Phentolamine Therapy for Cocaine-Association Acute Coronary Syndrome (CAACS). ''Journal of Medical Toxicology''. 2006 Sep;2(3):108-11.</ref>

When given by injection it causes blood vessels to [[vasodilation|dilate]], thereby increasing blood flow. When injected into the penis (intracavernosal), it increases blood flow to the penis, which results in an erection.<ref>Bella AJ, Brock GB. Intracavernous pharmacotherapy for erectile dysfunction. ''Endocrine''. 2004 Mar-Apr;23(2-3):149-55.</ref>

It may be stored in [[crash cart]]s to counteract severe peripheral vasoconstriction secondary to [[extravasation]] of peripherally placed [[vasopressor]] infusions, typically of [[norepinephrine]]. [[Epinephrine]] infusions are less vasoconstrictive than norepinephrine as they primarily stimulate β receptor more than α receptors, but the effect remains dose-dependent.

Phentolamine also has diagnostic and therapeutic roles in [[complex regional pain syndrome]] (reflex sympathetic dystrophy).<ref>Rowbotham MC. Pharmacologic management of complex regional pain syndrome. ''Clinical Journal of Pain''. 2006 Jun;22(5):425-9.</ref>

Phentolamine is marketed in the dental field as a local anesthetic reversal agent.  Branded as OraVerse, it is a phentolamine mesylate injection designed to reverse the local vasoconstrictor properties used in many local anesthetics to prolong anesthesia.<ref>http://www.novalar.com/oraverse-dental-specialty-pharmaceutical</ref><ref>Malamed S. What's new in local anaesthesia? ''Society For The Advancement Of Anaesthesia In Dentistry Digest''. 2009 Jan;25:4-14.</ref>

==Chemistry==
Phentolamine can be synthesized by alkylation of 3-(4-methylanilino)phenol using 2-chloromethylimidazoline:<ref>K. Miescher, A. Marxer, E. Urech, {{US Patent|2503059}} (1950)</ref><ref>E. Urech, A. Marxer, K. Miescher, Helv. Chim. Acta, 33, 1386 (1950)</ref>
