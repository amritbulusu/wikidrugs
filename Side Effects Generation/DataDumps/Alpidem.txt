'''Alpidem''' ('''Ananxyl''') is an [[anxiolytic]] drug from the [[imidazopyridine]] family, related to the more well known sleeping medication [[zolpidem]]. Unlike zolpidem however, alpidem does not produce [[sedative]] effects at normal doses, and is instead used specifically for the treatment of [[anxiety]].<ref>Zivkovic B, Morel E, Joly D, Perrault G, Sanger DJ, Lloyd KG. Pharmacological and behavioral profile of alpidem as an anxiolytic. ''Synthelabo Recherche'', L.E.R.S., Bagneux, France. 1990 May;23 Suppl 3:108-13. {{PMID|1974069}}</ref><ref>Sanger DJ, Zivkovic B.

Alpidem was developed by  Synth√©labo (now part of [[Sanofi-Aventis]]).  It was approved for marketing in France in 1991.  Clinical trial to obtain US FDA approval were halted in 1992 and the drug never received FDA approval.  It was withdrawn from the French market by 1994 and is not approved for marketing anywhere in the world.<ref>[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/druginfo/DRUG_INFO_8_2_1994.pdf  WHO Drug Information Vol. 8, No. 2, 1994, page 64]</ref>

Alpidem has nanomolar binding affinity for both the central benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) and the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) ([[translocator protein]] 18 kDa) (PBR (Ki ) 0.5-7 nM) and CBR (Ki ) 1-28 nM, respectively).<ref>(a) Bourguignon, J.

==Indications==

Alpidem is not approved for any indication.

==Use prior to removal from market==
Alpidem was generally prescribed to patients with moderate-to-severe [[anxiety]].<ref>Kunovac JL, Stahl SM. Future directions in anxiolytic pharmacotherapy. ''Psychiatric Clinics of North America''. 1995 Dec;18(4):895-909.</ref> Most of these patients had exhibited either [[Stimulus (physiology)|sensitivity]] or [[drug resistance|resistance]] to [[benzodiazepine]] therapy, and therefore switched to a non-benzodiazepine medication due to the reduced incidence of side effects relative to benzodiazepine drugs.<ref>Morton S, Lader M. Studies with alpidem in normal volunteers and anxious patients. ''Pharmacopsychiatry''. 1990 May;23 Suppl 3:120-3.</ref><ref>Frattola L, Garreau M, Piolti R, Bassi S, Albizzati MG, Borghi C, Morselli PL. Comparison of the efficacy, safety and withdrawal of alpidem and alprazolam in anxious patients. ''[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]''. 1994 Jul;165(2):94-100.</ref> Alpidem produced little or no [[sedative]] or [[hypnotic]] action at normal doses but may have produced sedation when used at a high dose, and only had [[anticonvulsant]] actions at much higher doses than those used clinically for the treatment of anxiety.<ref>Zivkovic B, Morel E, Joly D, Perrault G, Sanger DJ, Lloyd KG. Pharmacological and behavioral profile of alpidem as an anxiolytic. ''Pharmacopsychiatry''. 1990 May;23 Suppl 3:108-13.</ref>

==Dangers==
In 1995, Alpidem was [[List of withdrawn drugs|withdrawn from the market]] in most of the world following reports of severe [[Hepatotoxicity|liver damage]].<ref>Berson A, et al. (2001) [http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/299/2/793.full.pdf Toxicity of alpidem, a peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligand, but not zolpidem, in rat hepatocytes: role of mitochondrial permeability transition and metabolic activation].
