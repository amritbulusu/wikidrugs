'''Eribulin''' is an [[anticancer drug]] marketed by [[Eisai Co.]] under the trade name '''Halaven'''. Eribulin is also known as E7389 and ER-086526, and also carries the US NCI designation NSC-707389. It is used to treat certain patients with breast cancer and liposarcoma.

==Approvals and indications==

===Breast cancer===
The [[mesylate]] salt was approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] on November 15, 2010, to treat patients with [[metastatic breast cancer]] who have received at least two prior chemotherapy regimens for late-stage disease, including both [[anthracycline]]- and [[taxane]]-based [[chemotherapy|chemotherapies]].<ref>{{cite press release | title = FDA approves new treatment option for late-stage breast cancer | publisher = USFDA | date = 2010-11-15 | url = http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm233863.htm | accessdate = November 15, 2010}}</ref> It was approved by [[Health Canada]] on December 14, 2011, for treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer who have previously received at least two chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of metastatic disease.<ref>[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/prodpharma/sbd-smd/drug-med/nd_ad_2012_halaven_141946-eng.php Notice of Decision for HALAVEN]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===Liposarcoma===
On January 28, 2016 the US FDA approved Halaven for the treatment of inoperable [[liposarcoma]] in patients who received prior chemotherapy that contained an [[anthracycline]] drug.<ref name=FDA-lipo2016>[http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm483714.htm FDA approves first drug to show survival benefit in liposarcoma.

==Clinical trials==
Eribulin is also being investigated by Eisai Co. for use in a variety of other solid tumors, including [[non-small cell lung cancer]], [[prostate cancer]] and [[sarcoma]].<ref>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=eribulin+OR+E7389</ref>
