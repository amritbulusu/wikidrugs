'''Nitric oxide''' ([[nitrogen oxide]],<ref>[[IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry 2005]]. [http://old.iupac.org/publications/books/rbook/Red_Book_2005.pdf PDF].</ref> nitrogen monoxide) is a [[molecule|molecular]], [[chemical compound]] with [[chemical formula]] of [[unpaired electron|·]][[Nitrogen|N]][[Oxygen|O]]. One of several [[oxide]]s of nitrogen, it is a colorless gas under [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard conditions]]. Nitric oxide is a [[free radical]]—i.e., its bonding structure includes an [[unpaired electron]],<ref>{{cite book|author1=Lund, Anders |author2=Shimada, Shigetaka |author3=Shiotani, Masaru |title=Principles and Applications of ESR Spectroscopy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GWUqeLasL88C|date=2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-5344-3}}</ref> represented by the dot (·) on the nitrogen atom—and it is in the class of heteronuclear [[diatomic molecule]]s that are of historic theoretical interest (for the insights they gave in formulating early modern [[molecular orbital theory|theories of bonding]]). It is a particularly important [[Reaction intermediate|intermediate]] in the [[chemical industry]].  In addition, nitric oxide is formed in nitrogen-oxygen mixtures at high-temperature conditions, such as those found in combustion systems including [[Internal combustion engine|internal combustion piston engines]], [[Gas turbine|gas turbines]], [[Furnace|industrial furnaces]], and [[Boiler|boilers]]. It is also produced naturally by the extremely high air temperatures produced along the path of lightning in thunderstorms.

In mammals including humans, nitric oxide is an important cellular [[signaling molecule]] involved in many physiological and pathological processes.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=10390607|year=1999|last1=Hou|first1=YC|last2=Janczuk|first2=A|last3=Wang|first3=PG|title=Current trends in the development of nitric oxide donors|volume=5|issue=6|pages=417–41|journal=Current pharmaceutical design}}</ref> It is a powerful vasodilator with a short half-life of a few seconds in the blood. Long-known pharmaceuticals such as [[nitroglycerine]] and [[amyl nitrite]] were found to be precursors to nitric oxide more than a century after their first use in medicine. Low levels of nitric oxide production are important in protecting organs such as the liver from [[ischemic damage]]. Nitric oxide production is associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and is essential for hepatic lipid metabolism under starvation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gu|first1=Qilin|last2=Yang|first2=Xiaojie|last3=Lin|first3=Li|last4=Li|first4=Shaoyang|last5=Li|first5=Qing|last6=Zhong|first6=Shan|last7=Peng|first7=Jinrong|last8=Cui|first8=Zongbin|title=Genetic ablation of solute carrier family 7a3a leads to hepatic steatosis in zebrafish during fasting|journal=Hepatology|date=December 2014|volume=60|issue=6|pages=1929–1941|doi=10.1002/hep.27356|pmid=25130427}}</ref>

==Reactions==
*When exposed to [[oxygen]], nitric oxide is converted into [[nitrogen dioxide]].
:: 2 ·NO + O<sub>2</sub> → 2 NO<sub>2</sub>

:This conversion has been speculated as occurring via the ONOONO intermediate. In water, nitric oxide reacts with oxygen and water to form HNO<sub>2</sub> or [[nitrous acid]]. The reaction is thought to proceed via the following [[stoichiometry]]:
:: 4 ·NO + O<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O → 4 HNO<sub>2</sub>

*Nitric oxide will react with [[fluorine]], [[chlorine]], and [[bromine]] to form the XNO species, known as the nitrosyl halides, such as [[nitrosyl chloride]]. Nitrosyl iodide can form but is an extremely short-lived species and tends to reform I<sub>2</sub>.
:: 2 ·NO + Cl<sub>2</sub> → 2 NOCl
*[[Nitroxyl]] (HNO) is the reduced form of nitric oxide.
*Nitric oxide dimer N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>is formed when nitric oxide is cooled.
*Nitric oxide reacts with [[acetone]] and an [[alkoxide]] to a ''diazeniumdiolate'' or ''nitrosohydroxylamine'' and [[methyl acetate]]:<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/jlac.18983000108|title=Ueber Synthesen stickstoffhaltiger Verbindungen mit Hülfe des Stickoxyds|year=1898|last1=Traube|first1=Wilhelm|journal=Justus Liebig's Annalen der Chemie|volume=300|pages=81–128}}</ref>

:This reaction was discovered around 1898, and remains of interest in nitric oxide [[prodrug]] research. Nitric oxide can also react directly with [[sodium methoxide]], forming [[sodium formate]] and [[nitrous oxide]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/jo7020423|title=Nitric Oxide Reacts with Methoxide|year=2008|last1=Derosa|first1=Frank|last2=Keefer|first2=Larry K.|last3=Hrabie|first3=Joseph A.|journal=The Journal of Organic Chemistry|volume=73|pages=1139–42|pmid=18184006|issue=3}}</ref>

===Preparation===
In commercial settings, nitric oxide is produced by the [[oxidation]] of [[ammonia]] at 750–900&nbsp;°C (normally at 850&nbsp;°C) with [[platinum]] as [[catalyst]]:

:4 NH<sub>3</sub> + 5 O<sub>2</sub> → 4 ·NO + 6 H<sub>2</sub>O

The uncatalyzed [[endothermic]] reaction of [[oxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>) and [[nitrogen]] (N<sub>2</sub>), which is performed at high temperature (>2000&nbsp;°C) by lightning has not been developed into a practical commercial synthesis (see [[Birkeland–Eyde process]]):

:N<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → 2 ·NO

In the laboratory, nitric oxide is conveniently generated by reduction of dilute [[nitric acid]] with [[copper]]:

:8 HNO<sub>3</sub> + 3 Cu → 3 Cu(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 4 H<sub>2</sub>O + 2 ·NO

or by the reduction of nitrous acid in the form of [[sodium nitrite]] or [[potassium nitrite]]:
: 2 NaNO<sub>2</sub> + 2 NaI + 2 H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> → I<sub>2</sub> + 4 NaHSO<sub>4</sub> + 2 ·NO
: 2 NaNO<sub>2</sub> + 2 FeSO<sub>4</sub> + 3 H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> → Fe<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> + 2 NaHSO<sub>4</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O + 2 ·NO
: 3 KNO<sub>2(l)</sub> + KNO<sub>3(l)</sub> + Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3(s)</sub> → 2 K<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4(s)</sub> + 4 NO<sub>(g)</sub>

The iron(II) sulfate route is simple and has been used in undergraduate laboratory experiments. So-called [[NONOate]] compounds are also used for nitric oxide generation.

===Coordination chemistry===
{{Main article|Metal nitrosyl}}
Nitric oxide reacts with all [[transition metal]]s to give complexes called [[metal nitrosyl]]s. The most common bonding mode of nitric oxide is the terminal linear type (M−NO). The angle of the M−N−O group varies from 160° to 180° but is still termed "linear". In this case, the nitric oxide group is considered a 3-electron donor under the covalent (neutral) method of electron counting, or a 2-electron donor under the ionic method.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Robert H.| last=Crabtree |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0bXMwefSs-kC&pg=PA32 |title=The Organometallic Chemistry of the Transition Metals|publisher= John Wiley and Sons|year= 2005|page=32|isbn=9780471718758}}</ref> One can view such complexes as derived from NO<sup>+</sup>, which is isoelectronic with [[carbon monoxide]] (CO).

In the case of a bent M−N−O conformation, the ·NO group can be considered a one-electron donor using neutral counting, or a 2-electron donor using ionic counting.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Robert H.| last=Crabtree |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0bXMwefSs-kC&pg=PA32 |title=The Organometallic Chemistry of the Transition Metals|publisher= John Wiley and Sons|year= 2005|pages=96–98|isbn=9780471718758}}</ref>

Nitric oxide can serve as a one-electron pseudohalide. In such complexes, the M−N−O group is characterized by an angle between 120° and 140°.

The ·NO group can also bridge between metal centers through the nitrogen atom in a variety of geometries.

===Concentration measurement===
[[File:The production and diffusion of nitric oxide (NO) (white) in the cytoplasm (green) of clusters of conifer cells one hour after mechanical agitation.jpg|thumb|250px|Nitric oxide (white) in [[pinophyta|conifer]] cells, visualized using DAF-2 DA (diaminofluorescein diacetate)]]

Nitric oxide concentration can be determined using a simple [[chemiluminescence|chemiluminescent reaction]] involving [[ozone]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Homogeneous chemiluminescent measurement of nitric oxide with ozone. Implications for continuous selective monitoring of gaseous air pollutants|year=1970 |last1=Fontijn |first1=Arthur. |last2=Sabadell |first2=Alberto J. |last3=Ronco |first3=Richard J. |journal=Analytical Chemistry |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=575–579 |doi=10.1021/ac60288a034}}</ref> A sample containing nitric oxide is mixed with a large quantity of ozone. The nitric oxide reacts with the ozone to produce [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen dioxide]], accompanied with emission of [[light]] ([[chemiluminescence]]):
: ·NO + O<sub>3</sub> → NO<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> + ''hν''
which can be measured with a [[photodetector]]. The amount of light produced is proportional to the amount of nitric oxide in the sample.

Other methods of testing include [[electrochemistry|electroanalysis]] (amperometric approach), where ·NO reacts with an electrode to induce a current or voltage change. The detection of NO radicals in biological tissues is particularly difficult due to the short lifetime and concentration of these radicals in tissues. One of the few practical methods is [[spin trapping]] of nitric oxide with iron-[[dithiocarbamate]] complexes and subsequent detection of the mono-nitrosyl-iron complex with [[electron paramagnetic resonance]] (EPR).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vanin |first1=A |last2=Huisman |first2=A |last3=Van Faassen |first3=E |year=2002 |title=Iron dithiocarbamate as spin trap for nitric oxide detection: Pitfalls and successes |journal=Methods in enzymology |volume=359 |pages=27–42 |pmid=12481557 |doi=10.1016/S0076-6879(02)59169-2 |series=Methods in Enzymology |isbn=9780121822620}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nagano |first1=T |last2=Yoshimura |first2=T |year=2002 |title=Bioimaging of nitric oxide |journal=Chemical Reviews |volume=102 |issue=4 |pages=1235–70 |doi=10.1021/cr010152s |pmid=11942795}}</ref>

A group of [[fluorescent dye]] indicators that are also available in [[acetyl]]ated form for intracellular measurements exist. The most common compound is [[4,5-diaminofluorescein]] (DAF-2).<ref name="undefined">{{cite journal

== Production ==
From a thermodynamic perspective, ·NO is unstable with respect to O<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>, although this conversion is very slow at ambient temperatures in the absence of a [[catalyst]]. Because the heat of formation of ·NO is [[endothermic]], its synthesis from molecular nitrogen and oxygen requires elevated temperatures above 1000&nbsp;°C.

A major natural source is [[lightning]]. The use of [[internal combustion engine]]s has drastically increased the presence of nitric oxide in the environment. One purpose of [[catalytic converter]]s in cars is to minimize ·NO emission by catalytic reversion to O<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>.

== Environmental effects ==
{{Main article|NOx}}

=== Acid deposition ===
Nitric oxide reacts with the hydroperoxy radical (HO<sub>2</sub><sup>•</sup>) to form nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), which then can react with a hydroxyl radical (<sup>[[Hydroxyl radical|•]]</sup>[[Hydroxyl radical|OH]]) to produce [[nitric acid]] (HNO<sub>3</sub>):
: ·NO + HO<sub>2</sub><sup>•</sup>→ <sup>•</sup>NO<sub>2</sub> + <sup>•</sup>OH
: ·NO<sub>2</sub> +  <sup>•</sup>OH → HNO<sub>3</sub>
Nitric acid, along with [[sulfuric acid]], contribute [[acid rain]] deposition.

=== Ozone depletion ===
Furthermore, ·NO participates in [[ozone layer depletion]]. In this process, nitric oxide reacts with stratospheric [[ozone]] to form O<sub>2</sub> and nitrogen dioxide:
: ·NO + O<sub>3</sub> → NO<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>
As seen in the Concentration Measurement section, this reaction is also utilized to measure concentrations  of ·NO in control volumes.

=== Precursor to NO<sub>2</sub> ===
As seen in the Acid deposition section, nitric oxide can transform into nitrogen dioxide (this can happen with the hydroperoxy radical, HO<sub>2</sub><sup>•</sup>, or diatomic oxygen, O<sub>2</sub>). Symptoms of short-term nitrogen dioxide exposure include nausea, [[dyspnea]] and headache. Long-term effects could include impaired immune and [[Respiratory system|respiratory]] function.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ipcsneng/neng0930.html|title = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|date=1 July 2014 |accessdate = 10 December 2015|website =NIOSH |publisher = }}</ref>

==Technical applications==
Although ·NO has relatively few direct uses, it is produced on a massive scale as an intermediate in the [[Ostwald process]] for the synthesis of [[nitric acid]] from [[ammonia]]. In 2005, the US alone produced 6 million metric tons of nitric acid.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Production: Growth is the Norm|journal= Chemical and Engineering News|date= July 10, 2006|volume=84 |issue=28|pages= 59–68|doi=10.1021/cen-v084n028.p059}}</ref> It finds use in the [[semiconductor]] industry for various processes. In one of its applications, it is used along with [[nitrous oxide]] to form [[silicon oxynitride|oxynitride]] gates in [[CMOS]] devices.

===Miscellaneous applications===
Nitric oxide can be used for detecting surface radicals on polymers. Quenching of surface [[Radical (chemistry)|radicals]] with nitric oxide results in incorporation of nitrogen, which can be quantified by means of [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]].

==Biological functions==
{{Main article|Biological functions of nitric oxide}}
NO is one of the few [[gaseous signaling molecules]] known and is additionally exceptional due to the fact that it is a radical gas. It is a key [[vertebrate]] [[signal transduction|biological messenger]], playing a role in a variety of biological processes.<ref>Weller, Richard, [http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_weller_could_the_sun_be_good_for_your_heart.html Could the sun be good for your heart?] TedxGlasgow.

Nitric oxide, known as an [[endothelium-derived relaxing factor]] (EDRF), is biosynthesized endogenously from [[arginine|<small>L</small>-arginine]], [[oxygen]], and [[NADPH]] by various [[nitric oxide synthase]] (NOS) [[enzyme]]s. Reduction of inorganic nitrate may also serve to make nitric oxide. The [[endothelium]] (inner lining) of [[blood vessel]]s uses nitric oxide to signal the surrounding [[smooth muscle]] to relax, thus resulting in [[vasodilation]] and increasing blood flow. Nitric oxide is highly reactive (having a lifetime of a few seconds), yet diffuses freely across membranes. These attributes make nitric oxide ideal for a transient [[paracrine]] (between adjacent cells) and [[autocrine]] (within a single cell) signaling molecule.<ref name="stryer">{{cite book|last = Stryer| first = Lubert| title = Biochemistry, 4th Edition| publisher = W.H.

The inducible pathway (iNOS) of nitrogen oxide synthesis in phagocytes can generate large amounts of [[unpaired electron|·]][[Nitrogen|N]][[Oxygen|O]] that trigger [[apoptosis]] in and thereby the death of cells.

Nitric oxide can contribute to [[reperfusion injury]] when an excessive amount produced during reperfusion (following a period of [[ischemia]]) reacts with [[superoxide]] to produce the damaging oxidant [[peroxynitrite]]. In contrast, inhaled nitric oxide has been shown to help survival and recovery from [[paraquat]] poisoning, which produces lung tissue-damaging superoxide and hinders NOS metabolism.

In plants, nitric oxide can be produced by any of four routes: (i) L-arginine-dependent nitric oxide synthase,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Cellular and subcellular localization of endogenous nitric oxide in young and senescent pea plants|author=Corpas, F.

Two important biological reaction mechanisms of nitric oxide are S-[[nitrosation]] of thiols, and nitrosylation of transition metal ions. S-nitrosation involves the (reversible) conversion of [[thiol]] groups, including [[cysteine]] residues in proteins, to form S-nitrosothiols (RSNOs). S-[[Nitrosation]] is a mechanism for dynamic, post-translational regulation of most or all major classes of protein.<ref>van Faassen, E. and Vanin, A. (eds.) (2007) ''Radicals for life: The various forms of nitric oxide''. Elsevier, Amsterdam, {{ISBN|978-0-444-52236-8}}</ref> The second mechanism, nitrosylation, involves the binding of ·NO to a transition metal ion like iron or copper. In this function, ·NO is referred to as a nitrosyl ligand. Typical cases involve the nitrosylation of heme proteins like cytochromes, thereby disabling the normal enzymatic activity of the enzyme. Nitrosylated ferrous iron is particularly stable, as the binding of the nitrosyl ligand to ferrous iron (Fe(II)) is very strong. Hemoglobin is a prominent example of a heme protein that may be modified by ·NO by both pathways: ·NO may attach directly to the heme in the nitrosylation reaction, and independently form S-nitrosothiols by S-nitrosation of the thiol moieties.<ref>van Faassen, E. and Vanin, A. (2004) "Nitric Oxide", in ''Encyclopedia of Analytical Science'', 2nd ed., Elsevier, {{ISBN|0127641009}}.</ref>

===Mechanism of action===
There are several mechanisms by which ·NO has been demonstrated to affect the biology of living cells. These include oxidation of iron-containing proteins such as [[ribonucleotide reductase]] and [[aconitase]], activation of the soluble [[guanylate cyclase]], ADP ribosylation of proteins, protein sulfhydryl group [[nitrosylation]], and iron regulatory factor activation.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=7658698|year=1995|last1=Shami|first1=PJ|last2=Moore|first2=JO|last3=Gockerman|first3=JP|last4=Hathorn|first4=JW|last5=Misukonis|first5=MA|last6=Weinberg|first6=JB|title=Nitric oxide modulation of the growth and differentiation of freshly isolated acute non-lymphocytic leukemia cells|volume=19|issue=8|pages=527–33|journal=Leukemia research|doi=10.1016/0145-2126(95)00013-E}}</ref> ·NO has been demonstrated to activate [[NF-κB]] in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, an important transcription factor in iNOS gene expression in response to inflammation.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Kaibori M. |author2=Sakitani K. |author3=Oda M. |author4=Kamiyama Y. |author5=Masu Y. |author6=Okumura T. |year=1999|title=Immunosuppressant FK506 inhibits inducible nitric oxide synthase gene expression at a step of NF-κB activation in rat hepatocytes|journal=J.

It was found that ·NO acts through the stimulation of the soluble guanylate cyclase, which is a heterodimeric enzyme with subsequent formation of cyclic-GMP. Cyclic-GMP activates [[protein kinase G]], which causes reuptake of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and the opening of calcium-activated potassium channels. The fall in concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ensures that the myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) can no longer phosphorylate the myosin molecule, thereby stopping the crossbridge cycle and leading to relaxation of the smooth muscle cell.<ref>{{cite book|pmid=174|year=2003|last1=Rhoades|first1=RA|last2=Tanner|first2=GA|title=Medical physiology 2nd edition}}</ref>

==Medical use==

=== Neonatal use ===
Nitric oxide/oxygen blends are used in critical care to promote capillary and pulmonary dilation to treat primary [[pulmonary hypertension]] in neonatal patients<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barrington|first=Keith J.|last2=Finer|first2=Neil|last3=Pennaforte|first3=Thomas|last4=Altit|first4=Gabriel|date=2017|title=Nitric oxide for respiratory failure in infants born at or near term|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=1|pages=CD000399|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000399.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=28056166|via=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chotigeat U, Khorana M, Kanjanapattanakul W |title=Inhaled nitric oxide in newborns with severe hypoxic respiratory failure |journal=J Med Assoc Thai |volume=90 |issue=2 |pages=266–71 |year=2007 |pmid=17375630 }}</ref> and post-meconium aspiration related to birth defects. These are often a last-resort gas mixture before the use of [[extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]] (ECMO). Nitric oxide therapy has the potential to significantly increase the quality of life and, in some cases, save the lives of infants at risk for pulmonary vascular disease.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=10690334|year=1999|last1=Hayward|first1=CS|last2=Kelly|first2=RP|last3=MacDonald|first3=PS|title=Inhaled nitric oxide in cardiology practice|volume=43|issue=3|pages=628–38|journal=Cardiovascular research|doi=10.1016/S0008-6363(99)00114-5}}</ref>

=== Pediatric and adult use ===
The primary use is in the form of [[Nitroglycerin_(drug)|nitroglycerin]], either pill or liquid spray forms, which, as a prodrug, is [[Denitration|denitrated]] and releases the active metabolite nitric oxide (NO).

As with all supplements of nitric oxide, the response is short-lived because, as a normally produced internal physiologic control mechanism, increased concentrations leads to increased rates of clearance, the reason that sustained use of nitroglycerin for vasodilation fades to none after hours to days.

In the United States, ongoing direct use of nitric oxide use is only approved for [[neonates]]. In the adult ICU setting, inhaled ·NO can improve hypoxemia in [[acute lung injury]], [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]], and severe [[pulmonary hypertension]], although the effects are short-lived and there are no studies demonstrating improved clinical outcomes. It is used on an individualized basis in ICUs as an adjunct to other definitive therapies for reversible causes of hypoxemic respiratory distress.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Mark J.D. Griffiths, M.R.C.P. |author2=Timothy W. Evans, M.D. |title= Inhaled Nitric Oxide Therapy in Adults |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=353 |pages=2683–2695 |date=December 22, 2005 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra051884 |issue=25 |pmid=16371634}}</ref>

=== Dosage and strength ===
Currently in the United States, nitric oxide is a gas available in concentrations of only 100 ppm and 800 ppm. Overdosage with inhaled nitric oxide will be seen by elevations in [[methemoglobin]] and pulmonary toxicities associated with inspired ·NO. Elevated NO may cause [[acute lung injury]].

=== Contraindications ===
Inhaled nitric oxide is contraindicated in the treatment of neonates known to be dependent on right-to-left shunting of blood. This is as the nitric oxide decreases the pulmonary circulation's resistance by dilating pulmonary blood vessels. The increased pulmonary return increases pressure in the left atrium, causing closure of the foramen ovale and reducing the blood flow through the ductus arteriosus. Closing these shunts can kill neonates with heart malformations that rely on the right-to-left shunting of blood.

=== Pulmonary embolism ===
Nitric oxide is also administered as [[salvage therapy]] in patients with acute [[right ventricular failure]] secondary to [[pulmonary embolism]].<ref name="pmid22005573">{{cite journal| vauthors=Summerfield DT, Desai H, Levitov A, Grooms DA, Marik PE | title=Inhaled Nitric Oxide as Salvage Therapy in Massive Pulmonaryembolism: A Case Series | journal=Respir Care | year= 2011 | volume=  57| issue=  3| pages=  444–8| pmid=22005573 | doi=10.4187/respcare.01373 }}</ref>

=== Pharmacology ===
Nitric oxide is considered an [[Antianginal|anti]][[Angina pectoris|anginal]] drug: It causes [[vasodilation]], which can help with ischemic pain, known as angina, by decreasing the cardiac workload. By dilating (expanding) the arteries, nitric oxide drugs lower arterial pressure and left ventricular filling pressure.<ref name="Jonathan Abrams 1996">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0002-9149(96)00186-5|title=Beneficial actions of nitrates in cardiovascular disease|year=1996|last1=Abrams|first1=J|journal=The American Journal of Cardiology|volume=77|pages=31C–7C|pmid=8638524|issue=13}}</ref>

This vasodilation does not decrease the volume of blood the heart pumps, but rather it decreases the force the heart muscle must exert to pump the same volume of blood. Nitroglycerin pills, taken sublingually (under the tongue), are used to prevent or treat acute chest pain. The nitroglycerin reacts with a [[thiol|sulfhydryl]] group (–SH) to produce nitric oxide, which eases the pain by causing vasodilation. There is a potential role for the use of nitric oxide in alleviating bladder contractile dysfunctions,<ref name="Moro et al. 2013">{{cite journal | last1 = Moro| first1 = C | last2 = Leeds | first2 = C | last3 = Chess-Williams | first3 = R | title = Contractile activity of the bladder urothelium/lamina propria and its regulation by nitric oxide | journal = Eur J Pharmacol. |date=January 2012| volume = 674| issue = 2–3 | pages = 445–449| pmid = 22119378 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.11.020}}</ref><ref name="Andersson et al. 2008">{{cite journal | last1 = Andersson| first1 = M.C | last2 = Tobin | first2 = G | last3 = Giglio | first3 = D | title = Cholinergic nitric oxide release from the urinary bladder mucosa in cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis of the anaesthetized rat | journal = Br J Pharmacol |date=February 2008| volume = 153| issue = 7 | pages = 1438–44| pmc = 2437908 | doi = 10.1038/bjp.2008.6 | pmid=18246091}}</ref> and recent evidence suggests that nitrates may be beneficial for treatment of angina due to reduced myocardial oxygen consumption both by decreasing preload and afterload and by some direct vasodilation of coronary vessels.<ref name="Jonathan Abrams 1996"/>

=== Associated problems ===
There are some associated complaints with utilization of nitric oxide in neonatal patients. Some of them include dose errors associated with the delivery system, headaches associated with environmental exposure of nitric oxide in hospital staff, [[hypotension]] associated with acute withdrawal of the drug, hypoxemia associated with acute withdrawal of the drug, and pulmonary edema in patients with CREST syndrome.

=== Mechanism of action ===
Nitric oxide is a compound produced by many cells of the body. It relaxes vascular smooth muscle by binding to the heme moiety of cytosolic guanylate cyclase, activating guanylate cyclase and increasing intracellular levels of cyclic-guanosine 3’,5’-monophosphate, which then leads to vasodilation. When inhaled, nitric oxide dilates the pulmonary vasculature and, because of efficient scavenging by hemoglobin, has minimal effect on the vasculature of the entire body.<ref name="pmid16870914">{{cite journal|vauthors=Kinsella JP, Cutter GR, Walsh WF, Gerstmann DR, Bose CL, Hart C | title=Early inhaled nitric oxide therapy in premature newborns with respiratory failure | journal=N Engl J Med | year= 2006 | volume= 355 | issue= 4 | pages= 354–64 | pmid=16870914 | doi=10.1056/NEJMoa060442 | displayauthors=etal  }}</ref>

Inhaled nitric oxide appears to increase the [[partial pressure of arterial oxygen]] (P<sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) by dilating pulmonary vessels in better-ventilated areas of the lung, moving pulmonary blood flow away from lung segments with low ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) ratios toward segments with normal or better ratios.<ref name="pmid16870913">{{cite journal|vauthors=Ballard RA, Truog WE, Cnaan A, Martin RJ, Ballard PL, Merrill JD | title=Inhaled nitric oxide in preterm infants undergoing mechanical ventilation | journal=N Engl J Med | year= 2006 | volume= 355 | issue= 4 | pages= 343–53 | pmid=16870913 | doi=10.1056/NEJMoa061088  | displayauthors=etal  }}</ref>

==== Pharmacokinetics ====
Nitric oxide is absorbed systemically after inhalation. Most of it moves across the pulmonary capillary bed where it combines with hemoglobin that is 60% to 100% oxygen-saturated.

Nitrate has been identified as the predominant nitric oxide metabolite excreted in the urine, accounting for >70% of the nitric oxide dose inhaled. [[Nitrate]] is cleared from the plasma by the kidney at rates approaching the rate of glomerular filtration.

As a result of its broad antibacterial properties as well as high penetrability in cells, as of 2007 inhaled nitric oxide therapy was being studied as a potential therapeutic intervention in acute and chronic lung infections.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fang|first1=FC|title=Antimicrobial reactive oxygen and nitrogen species: concepts and controversies.|journal=Nature reviews.

== Occupational safety and health ==
People can be exposed to nitric oxide in the workplace by breathing it in. The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set the legal limit ([[permissible exposure limit]]) for nitric oxide exposure in the workplace as 25 ppm (30&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup>) over an 8-hour workday. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 25 ppm (30&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup>) over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 100 ppm, nitric oxide is [[IDLH|immediately dangerous to life and health]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = CDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards - Nitric oxide|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0448.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-20}}</ref>
