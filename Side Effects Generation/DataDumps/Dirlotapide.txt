'''Dirlotapide''' is a drug used to treat obesity in dogs.<ref name="PI" /> It is manufactured by [[Pfizer]] and [[Zoetis]] and marketed under the brand name '''Slentrol'''.

It works as a gut-selective [[microsomal triglyceride transfer protein]] (MTTP or MTP) inhibitor.<ref>http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2016/0002264.html</ref>  This blocks the assembly and release of [[lipoprotein]]s into the bloodstream, thereby reducing fat absorption.  It also elicits a [[Hunger|satiety]] signal from lipid-filled cells lining the intestine.

== Usage ==
It is supplied as an oral solution.  It is not intended for use in humans, cats, birds, rodents, or other animals.

Dirlotapide is used to manage obesity in dogs and helps by reducing appetite. It is used as part of an overall weight control program that also includes proper diet and exercise, under the supervision of a veterinarian. Side effects may include vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, drooling, or uncoordination. Allergic reaction to the medication may include, facial swelling, hives, scratching, sudden onset of diarrhea, vomiting, shock, seizures, pale gums, cold limbs, or coma.

== Regulation and safety ==
On January 5, 2007, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved Slentrol, the first time the FDA has approved a drug for obese dogs.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 2769592 | pmid=19885086 | volume=1 | title=Dirlotapide, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved first-in-class obesity drug for dogs-will humans be next? | year=2007 | journal=J Diabetes Sci Technol | pages=314–6 | last1 = Klonoff | first1 = DC | doi=10.1177/193229680700100301}}</ref><ref name="FDA approves Slentrol">{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070106/ap_on_he_me/doggie_diet_drug |title=FDA approves 1st drug for obese dogs |first=Andrew |last=Bridges |access-date=January 6, 2007 |agency=Associated Press |via=Yahoo!

However, concerns have since been raised, since 2010, about adverse effects<ref>http://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-pfizer-doesnt-want-the-fda-studying-its-diet-drug-for-dogs/</ref> that might more strongly affect particular [[Dog breed|breeds]].<ref>https://blogs.wsj.com/health/2010/10/14/fda-sniffing-around-pfizers-doggy-weight-loss-drug-slentrol/</ref>

Dirlotapide (under the brand name Slentrol) was authorized for use in the EU by the [[European Medicines Agency]] for helping weight loss in dogs, but has since been withdrawn from the market in the EU.<ref name="German 2016">{{cite journal|last1=German|first1=AJ|title=Weight management in obese pets: the tailoring concept and how it can improve results|journal=Acta veterinaria Scandinavica|date=20 October 2016|volume=58|issue=Suppl 1|pages=57|doi=10.1186/s13028-016-0238-z|pmid=27766974|pmc=5073926}}</ref>
