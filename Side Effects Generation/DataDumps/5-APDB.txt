'''5-(2-Aminopropyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran''' ('''5-APDB''', '''3-Desoxy-MDA''', '''EMA-4''') is a putative [[entactogen]] [[drug]] of the [[substituted phenethylamine|phenethylamine]] and [[substituted amphetamine|amphetamine]] classes.<ref name="pmid8246240">{{cite journal |vauthors=Monte AP, Marona-Lewicka D, Cozzi NV, Nichols DE | title = Synthesis and pharmacological examination of benzofuran, indan, and tetralin analogues of 3,4-(methylenedioxy)amphetamine | journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 36 | issue = 23 | pages = 3700–6 |date=November 1993 | pmid = 8246240 | doi = 10.1021/jm00075a027| url = }}</ref> It is an [[structural analog|analogue]] of [[3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine|MDA]] where the [[heterocyclic]] 3-position oxygen from the 3,4-[[methylenedioxy]] [[functional group|ring]] has been replaced by a [[methylene bridge]].<ref name="pmid8246240"/> 6-APDB is an analogue of 5-APDB where the 4-position oxygen has been replaced by a methylene bridge instead.<ref name="pmid8246240"/> 5-APDB was developed by a team led by [[David E. Nichols]] at [[Purdue University]] as part of their research into non-[[neurotoxic]] analogues of [[MDMA]].<ref name="pmid8246240"/>

In animal studies, 5-APDB's effects generalize most closely to non-[[stimulant]] MDMA analogues such as [[MBDB]] and [[5-Methyl-6-methoxy-2-aminoindane|MMAI]], while producing no substitution for [[LSD]] or [[amphetamine]].<ref name="pmid8246240"/> ''[[In vitro]]'' studies show that 5-APDB acts as a highly [[binding selectivity|selective]] [[serotonin releasing agent]] (SSRA), with [[IC50|IC<sub>50</sub>]] values of 130 nM, 7,089 nM, and 3,238 nM for [[reuptake inhibitor|inhibiting]] the [[reuptake]] of [[serotonin]], [[dopamine]], and [[norepinephrine]], respectively.<ref name="pmid8246240"/> In contrast, 6-APDB is more balanced on the three [[monoamine neurotransmitter|monoamine]] [[neurotransmitter]]s and acts more similarly to MDA and MDMA.<ref name="pmid8246240"/> 

Methoxy-substituted analogues of 5-APDB and 6-APDB have also been made and substituted for [[2,5-Dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine|DOM]] in animal tests, although they were around one tenth as potent as DOM.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jm00152a022 | last1 = Nichols | first1 = DE | last2 = Hoffman | first2 = AJ | last3 = Oberlender | first3 = RA | last4 = Riggs | first4 = RM | title = Synthesis and evaluation of 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran analogues of the hallucinogen 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)-2-aminopropane: drug discrimination studies in rats. | journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 302–4 | year = 1986 | pmid = 3950910 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jm00105a043 | last1 = Nichols | first1 = DE | last2 = Snyder | first2 = SE | last3 = Oberlender | first3 = R | last4 = Johnson | first4 = MP | last5 = Huang | first5 = XM | title = 2,3-Dihydrobenzofuran analogues of hallucinogenic phenethylamines. | journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 276–81 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1992127 }}</ref>

==Legal status==

===China===
As of October 2015 5-APDB is a controlled substance in China.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sfda.gov.cn/WS01/CL0056/130753.html | title=关于印发《非药用类麻醉药品和精神药品列管办法》的通知 | publisher=China Food and Drug Administration | date=27 September 2015 | language=Chinese | accessdate=1 October 2015}}</ref>

===UK===
On June 10, 2013 5-APDB and a number of analogues were classified as [[Temporary class drug|Temporary Class Drugs]] in the UK following an ACMD recommendation.<ref name='ACMD report'>{{cite web | url = https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/temporary-class-drug-order-report-on-benzofury-and-nbome-compounds | title = Temporary class drug order report on 5-6APB and NBOMe compounds | accessdate = 2013-06-13 | date = 4 Jun 2013 | publisher = UK Home Office}}</ref> This means that sale and import of the named substances are criminal offences and are treated as for class B drugs.<ref>{{cite news | title = 'NBOMe' and 'Benzofury' banned | date = 4 Jun 2013 | url = https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nbome-and-benzofury-to-be-banned | work = UK Home Office | accessdate = 2013-06-13}}</ref>
