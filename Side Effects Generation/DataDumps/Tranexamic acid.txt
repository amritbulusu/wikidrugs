===Special populations===
* Tranexamic acid is categorized as [[pregnancy category]] B. No harm has been found in animal studies.<ref name="Ferring Pharmaceuticals" />
* Small amounts appears in breast milk if taken during lactation.<ref name="Ferring Pharmaceuticals" /> If it is required for other reasons, breastfeeding may be continued.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tranexamic Acid use while Breastfeeding|url=http://www.drugs.com/breastfeeding/tranexamic-acid.html|website=www.drugs.com|accessdate=27 May 2016|date=7 Nov 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918132713/https://www.drugs.com/breastfeeding/tranexamic-acid.html|archivedate=18 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
* Tranexamic acid is also not indicated for postmenopausal women and geriatrics.<ref name="Ferring Pharmaceuticals" />
* In kidney impairment, tranexamic acid is not well studied. However, due to the fact that it is 95% excreted unchanged in the urine, it should be dose adjusted in patients with renal impairment.<ref name="Ferring Pharmaceuticals" />
* In liver impairment, dose change is not needed as only a small amount of the drug is metabolized through the liver.<ref name="Ferring Pharmaceuticals" />

==Mechanism of action==
Tranexamic acid is a synthetic [[functional analog (chemistry)|analog]] of the [[amino acid]] [[lysine]]. It serves as an [[antifibrinolytic]] by reversibly binding four to five lysine receptor sites on plasminogen or [[plasmin]]. This prevents plasmin ([[antiplasmin]]) from binding to and degrading [[fibrin]] and preserves the framework of fibrin's matrix structure.<ref name="Ferring Pharmaceuticals" /> Tranexamic acid has roughly eight times the [[antifibrinolytic]] activity of an older analogue, [[Aminocaproic acid|ε-aminocaproic acid]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
