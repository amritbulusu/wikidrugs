'''Piroxicam''' {{IPAc-en|p|aɪ|ˈ|r|ɒ|k|s|ɪ|ˌ|k|æ|m}} ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]], [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]], [[Australian Approved Name|AAN]]; in some countries it is spelt piroksikam or piroxikam) is a [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] (NSAID) of the [[oxicam]] class used to relieve the symptoms of painful, inflammatory conditions like [[arthritis]].<ref name = MD/><ref>{{cite journal | title=TGA Approved Terminology for Medicines, Section 1 – Chemical Substances | date=July 1999 | publisher=Therapeutic Goods Administration, Department of Health and Ageing, Australian Government | page=97 | url=http://www.tga.gov.au/pdf/medicines-approved-terminology-chemical.pdf | format=PDF }}</ref> Piroxicam works by preventing the production of endogenous [[prostaglandins]] which are involved in the mediation of pain, stiffness, tenderness and swelling.<ref name = MD/> The medicine is available as [[capsule (pharmacy)|capsules]], [[tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]] and (not in all countries) as a prescription-free [[gel]] 0.5%.<ref name = BNF/> It is also available in a betadex formulation, which allows a more rapid absorption of piroxicam from the digestive tract.<ref name = MD>{{cite web|title=Piroxicam|work=Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference|publisher=Pharmaceutical Press|date=14 January 2014|accessdate=24 June 2014|url=http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/martindale/current/ms-2692-v.htm|editor=Brayfield, A|location=London, UK}}</ref>

It was originally brought to market by [[Pfizer]] under the tradename '''Feldene''' in 1980, became generic in 1992,<ref name=NRDD/> and is marketed worldwide under many brandnames.<ref name=drugsInternat/>

==Medical uses==
It used in the treatment of [[rheumatoid arthritis|rheumatoid]] and [[osteoarthritis]], primary [[dysmenorrhoea]], postoperative pain; and act as an [[analgesic]], especially where there is an [[inflammation|inflammatory]] component.<ref name = MD/> The [[European Medicines Agency]] issued a review of its use in 2007 and recommended that its use be limited to the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions, as it only in these circumstances that its risk-benefit ratio proves to be favourable.<ref name = BNF/><ref name = EMA>{{cite web|title=COMMITTEE FOR MEDICINAL PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN USE (CHMP) OPINION FOLLOWING AN ARTICLE 31(2) REFERRAL PIROXICAM CONTAINING MEDICINAL PRODUCTS|work=European Medicines Agency|publisher=European Medicines Agency|date=20 September 2007|location=London, UK|accessdate=24 June 2014|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Referrals_document/Piroxicam_31/WC500011770.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
{{See also|Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug}}

As with other NSAIDs the principal side effects include: digestive complaints like [[nausea]], discomfort, [[diarrhoea]] and bleeds or ulceration of the [[stomach]], as well as [[headache]], dizziness, nervousness, [[depression (mood)|depression]], drowsiness, [[insomnia]], vertigo, hearing disturbances (such as [[tinnitus]]), [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[oedema]], light sensitivity, skin reactions (including, albeit rarely, [[Stevens-Johnson syndrome]] and [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]]) and rarely, [[kidney failure]], [[pancreatitis]], [[liver]] damage, visual disturbances, pulmonary [[eosinophilia]] and [[alveolitis]].<ref name="BNF">{{cite book | isbn = 978-0-85711-084-8 | title = British National Formulary (BNF) | last1 = Joint Formulary Committee | year = 2013 | publisher = Pharmaceutical Press | location = London, UK | edition = 65  | pages = 665, 673–674  }}</ref> Compared to other NSAIDs it is more prone to causing gastrointestinal disturbances and serious skin reactions.<ref name = BNF/>

==Mechanism of action==
{{See also|Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug}}

Piroxicam is an NSAID and, as such, is a non-selective [[cyclooxygenase|COX]] inhibitor possessing both analgesic and [[antipyretic]] properties.<ref name = BNF/>

==Chemical properties==
Piroxicam exists as enol [[tautomer]] in organic solvents and as [[zwitterion]]ic form in water.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ivanova D, Deneva V, Nedeltcheva D, Kamounah FS, Gergov G, Hansen PE, Kawauchi S, Antonov L | title = Tautomeric transformations of piroxicam in solution: a combined experimental and theoretical study  | journal = RSC Advances. | volume = 5 | pages = 31852–31860 | year = 2015 | doi=10.1039/c5ra03653d}}</ref>

==History==
The project that produced piroxicam began in 1962 at [[Pfizer]]; the first clinical trial results were reported in 1977, and the product launched in 1980 under the brand name "Feldene".<ref name=NRDD>Lombardino JG, Lowe JA 3rd.
