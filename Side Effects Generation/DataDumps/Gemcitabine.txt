==Contraindications and&nbsp;drug interactions==
Taking gemcitabine can also affect fertility in men and women, sex life, and menstruation. Women taking gemcitabine should not become pregnant, and pregnant and breastfeeding women should not take it.<ref name="Macmillan Cancer Support 2014" />

As of 2014 drug interactions had not been studied.<ref name=USlabel2014/><ref name=UKlabel2014/>

==Adverse effects==
Gemcitabine is a [[chemotherapy]] drug that works by killing any cells that are dividing.<ref name=UKlabel2014/> Cancer cells divide rapidly and so are targeted at higher rates by gemcitabine, but many essential cells divide rapidly as well, including cells in skin, the scalp, the lining of the stomach, and bone marrow, resulting in adverse effects.<ref>{{cite book | name-list-format = vanc  |author=Rachel Airley|title=Cancer Chemotherapy |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location= |year=2009 |isbn=0-470-09254-8}}</ref>{{rp|265}}

The gemcitabine label carries warnings that it can suppress bone marrow function and cause [[leukopenia|loss of white blood cells]], [[thrombocytopenia|loss of platelets]], and [[anaemia|loss of red blood cells]], that it should be used carefully in people with liver, kidney, or cardiovascular disorders, that people taking it should not take live vaccines, that it may cause [[posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome]], that it may cause [[capillary leak syndrome]], that it may cause severe lung conditions like [[pulmonary edema]], [[pneumonia]], and [[adult respiratory distress syndrome]], and that it may harm sperm.<ref name=UKlabel2014/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Siddall|first1=E|last2=Khatri|first2=M|last3=Radhakrishnan|first3=J|title=Capillary leak syndrome: etiologies, pathophysiology, and management.|journal=Kidney International|date=16 March 2017|doi=10.1016/j.kint.2016.11.029|pmid=28318633}}</ref>

Very common (more than 10% of people develop them) adverse effects include difficulty breathing, low white and red blood cells counts and low platelet counts, vomiting and nausea, [[elevated transaminases]], rashes and itchy skin, hair loss, blood and protein in urine, flu-like symptoms, and edema.<ref name=UKlabel2014/><ref name="Macmillan Cancer Support 2014">{{cite web|last1=Macmillan Cancer Support|title=Gemcitabine|url=http://www.macmillan.org.uk/cancerinformation/cancertreatment/treatmenttypes/chemotherapy/individualdrugs/gemcitabine.aspx|website=Macmillan Cancer Support|accessdate=6 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325222945/http://www.macmillan.org.uk/cancerinformation/cancertreatment/treatmenttypes/chemotherapy/individualdrugs/gemcitabine.aspx|archivedate=25 March 2017|df=}}</ref>

Common adverse effects (occurring in 1–10% of people) include fever, loss of appetite, headache, difficulty sleeping, tiredness, cough, runny nose, diarrhea, mouth and lip sores, sweating, back pain, and muscle pain.<ref name=UKlabel2014/>

==Pharmacology==
Gemcitabine is [[hydrophilic]] and must be transported into cells via molecular transporters for [[nucleoside]]s (the most common transporters for gemcitabine are SLC29A1 SLC28A1, and SLC28A3).<ref name=Alvarellos2014/><ref name=Mini2006/> After entering the cell, gemcitabine is first modified by attaching a [[phosphate]] to it, and so it becomes gemcitabine monophosphate (dFdCMP).<ref name=Alvarellos2014/><ref name=Mini2006/>  This is the [[rate-determining step]] that is catalyzed by the [[enzyme]] [[deoxycytidine kinase]] (DCK).<ref name=Alvarellos2014/><ref name=Mini2006/>  Two more phosphates are added by other enzymes. After the attachment of the three phosphates gemcitabine is finally pharmacologically active as gemcitabine triphosphate (dFdCTP).<ref name=Alvarellos2014/>

After being thrice [[phosphorylated]], gemcitabine can masquerade as [[cytidine]] and is incorporated into new DNA strands being synthesized as the cell [[self-replication|replicates]].<ref name="AHFS2016" /><ref name=Alvarellos2014>{{cite journal|last1=Alvarellos|first1=ML|last2=Lamba|first2=J|last3=Sangkuhl|first3=K|last4=Thorn|first4=CF|last5=Wang|first5=L|last6=Klein|first6=DJ|last7=Altman|first7=RB|last8=Klein|first8=TE|title=PharmGKB summary: gemcitabine pathway.|journal=Pharmacogenetics and genomics|date=November 2014|volume=24|issue=11|pages=564–74|pmid=25162786|pmc=4189987}}</ref><ref name=Mini2006>{{cite journal|last1=Mini|first1=E|last2=Nobili|first2=S|last3=Caciagli|first3=B|last4=Landini|first4=I|last5=Mazzei|first5=T|title=Cellular pharmacology of gemcitabine.|journal=Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology|date=May 2006|volume=17 Suppl 5|pages=v7-12|doi=10.1093/annonc/mdj941|pmid=16807468}}</ref>

When gemcitabine is incorporated into DNA it allows a native, or normal, nucleoside base to be added next to it. This leads to “masked chain termination” as gemcitabine is a “faulty” base, but due to its neighboring native nucleoside it eludes the cell's normal repair system ([[base-excision repair]]). Thus, incorporation of gemcitabine into the cell's DNA creates an irreparable error that leads to inhibition of further DNA synthesis, and thereby leading to cell death.<ref name="AHFS2016" /><ref name=Alvarellos2014/><ref name=Mini2006/>

The form of gemcitabine with two phosphates attached (dFdCDP) also has activity; it inhibits the enzyme [[ribonucleotide reductase]] (RNR), which is needed to create new nucleotides.  The lack of nucleotides drives the cell to uptake more of the components it needs to make nucleotides from outside the cell, which increases uptake of gemcitabine as well.<ref name="AHFS2016" /><ref name=Alvarellos2014/><ref name=Mini2006/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors=Cerqueira NM, Fernandes PA, Ramos MJ | title = Understanding ribonucleotide reductase inactivation by gemcitabine | journal = [[Chemistry: A European Journal]] | year = 2007 | volume = 13 | issue = 30 | pages = 8507–15 | doi = 10.1002/chem.200700260 | pmid = 17636467}}</ref>

The synthesis described and pictured below is the original synthesis done in the Eli Lilly Company labs. Synthesis begins with enantiopure D-glyceraldehyde (R)-2 as the starting material which can made from D-mannitol in 2–7 steps. Then fluorine is introduced by a "building block" approach using ethyl bromoidfluroacetate. Then, reformatsky reaction under standard conditions will yield a 3:1 anti/syn diastereomeric mixture, with one major product. Separation of the diastereomers is carried out via HPLC, thus yielding the anti-3 gemcitabine in a 65% yield.<ref name="Synthesis" /><ref name="Sythnesis Two" /> At least two other full synthesis methods have also been developed by different groups.<ref name="Sythnesis Two" />

==History==
Gemcitabine was first synthesized in [[Larry Hertel]]'s lab at [[Eli Lilly]] during the early 1980s.  It was intended as an [[Antiviral drug|antiviral]] drug, but preclinical testing showed that it killed leukemia cells ''in vitro''.<ref name=Sneader>{{cite book| author = Sneader, Walter| title = Drug discovery: a history| publisher = Wiley| location = New York| year = 2005| pages = 259| isbn = 0-471-89979-8| oclc = }}</ref>

During the early 1990s gemcitabine was studied in clinical trials. The pancreatic cancer trials found that gemcitabine increased one-year survival time significantly, and it was approved in the UK in 1995<ref name=UKlabel2014/> and approved by the FDA in 1996 for pancreatic cancers.<ref name=NCI2017/> In 1998, gemcitabine received FDA approval for treating non-small cell lung cancer and in 2004, it was approved from metastatic breast cancer.<ref name=NCI2017/>

Because it is clinically valuable and is only useful when delivered intravenously, methods to reformulate it so that it can be given by mouth have been a subject of research.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dyawanapelly|first1=S|last2=Kumar|first2=A|last3=Chourasia|first3=MK|title=Lessons Learned from Gemcitabine: Impact of Therapeutic Carrier Systems and Gemcitabine's Drug Conjugates on Cancer Therapy.|journal=Critical reviews in therapeutic drug carrier systems|date=2017|volume=34|issue=1|pages=63–96|doi=10.1615/CritRevTherDrugCarrierSyst.2017017912|pmid=28322141}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Birhanu|first1=G|last2=Javar|first2=HA|last3=Seyedjafari|first3=E|last4=Zandi-Karimi|first4=A|title=Nanotechnology for delivery of gemcitabine to treat pancreatic cancer.|journal=Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie|date=April 2017|volume=88|pages=635–643|doi=10.1016/j.biopha.2017.01.071|pmid=28142120}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dubey|first1=RD|last2=Saneja|first2=A|last3=Gupta|first3=PK|last4=Gupta|first4=PN|title=Recent advances in drug delivery strategies for improved therapeutic efficacy of gemcitabine.|journal=European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences|date=10 October 2016|volume=93|pages=147–62|doi=10.1016/j.ejps.2016.08.021|pmid=27531553}}</ref>

Research into [[pharmacogenomics]] and [[pharmacogenetics]] has been ongoing. As of 2014, it was not clear whether or not genetic tests could be useful in guiding dosing and which people respond best to gemcitabine.<ref name=Alvarellos2014/>  However, it appears that variation in the expression of proteins ([[SLC29A1]], [[SLC29A2]], [[SLC28A1]], and [[SLC28A3]]) used for transport of gemcitabine into the cell lead to variations in its potency. Similarly, the genes that express proteins that lead to its inactivation ([[deoxycytidine deaminase]], [[cytidine deaminase]], and [[NT5C]]) and that express its other intracellular targets ([[RRM1]], [[RRM2]], and [[RRM2B]]) lead to variations in response to the drug.<ref name=Alvarellos2014/>  Research has also been ongoing to understand how mutations in pancreatic cancers themselves determine response to gemcitabine.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pishvaian|first1=MJ|last2=Brody|first2=JR|title=Therapeutic Implications of Molecular Subtyping for Pancreatic Cancer.|journal=Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)|date=15 March 2017|volume=31|issue=3|pages=159–66, 168|pmid=28299752|url=http://www.cancernetwork.com/oncology-journal/therapeutic-implications-molecular-subtyping-pancreatic-cancer|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703100305/http://www.cancernetwork.com/oncology-journal/therapeutic-implications-molecular-subtyping-pancreatic-cancer|archivedate=3 July 2017|df=}}</ref>

It has been studied as a treatment for [[Kaposi sarcoma]], a common cancer in people with full blown [[AIDS]] which is uncommon in the developed world but not uncommon in the developing world.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Krown|first1=SE|title=Treatment strategies for Kaposi sarcoma in sub-Saharan Africa: challenges and opportunities.|journal=Current Opinion in Oncology|date=September 2011|volume=23|issue=5|pages=463–8|pmid=21681092|pmc=3465839}}</ref>
