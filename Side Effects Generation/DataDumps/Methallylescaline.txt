'''Methallylescaline''', or '''4-[[methyl|meth]][[allyl]][[Ketone|oxy]]-3,5-di[[methoxy]][[phenethylamine]]''', is a lesser-known [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|psychedelic drug]].  It is also the 4-[[methyl]] [[Analog (chemistry)|analog]] of [[allylescaline]]. Methallylescaline was first synthesized by [[Alexander Shulgin]]. In his book ''[[PiHKAL|PiHKAL (Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved)]]'', the dosage range is listed as 40–65&nbsp;mg, and the duration listed as 12–16 hours. Methallylescaline produces intense open and closed-eye visuals, such as [[neon]] [[colors]] and [[kaleidoscope]]-like imagery. Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of methallylescaline.

== Legal status ==
Allylescaline is illegal in Sweden as of 26 January 2016.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/nyheter-och-press/nyhetsarkiv/2015/november/31-nya-amnen-kan-klassas-som-narkotika-eller-halsofarlig-vara/ | title=31 nya ämnen kan klassas som narkotika eller hälsofarlig vara | publisher=Folkhälsomyndigheten | language=Swedish | date=November 2015}}</ref>
