===Methadone maintenance===
Methadone is indicated for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependency (i.e. opioid use disorder per the fifth edition of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM). A 2009 [[Cochrane review]] found that methadone was effective in retaining people in treatment and in the reduction or cessation of heroin use as measured by self-report and urine/hair analysis but did not affect criminal activity or risk of death.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002209.pub2 |title=Methadone maintenance therapy versus no opioid replacement therapy for opioid dependence |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2009 |last1=Mattick |first1=Richard P |last2=Breen |first2=Courtney |last3=Kimber |first3=Jo |last4=Davoli |first4=Marina |editor1-last=Mattick |editor1-first=Richard P |pmid=19588333 |issue=4 |pages=CD002209}}</ref>

The treatment of opioid-dependent persons with methadone will follow one of two routes.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} MMT (methadone maintenance therapy) is prescribed to individuals who wish to abstain from illicit drug use but have failed to maintain abstinence from opioids for significant periods. The duration of methadone maintenance ranges from a few months to lifelong. Methadone reduction programs are suitable for addicted persons who wish to completely stop using drugs. The length of the reduction program will depend on the starting dose and speed of reduction, this varies between clinics and from person to person.<ref name="JosephStancliffLangrod"/><ref name="Connock">{{cite journal |pmid=17313907 |year=2007 |last1=Connock |first1=M |last2=Juarez-Garcia |first2=A |last3=Jowett |first3=S |last4=Frew |first4=E |last5=Liu |first5=Z |last6=Taylor |first6=RJ |last7=Fry-Smith |first7=A |last8=Day |first8=E |last9=Listerine |first9=N |last10=Roberts |first10=T |last11=Burls |first11=A |last12=Taylor |first12=RS |title=Methadone and buprenorphine for the management of opioid dependence: A systematic review and economic evaluation |volume=11 |issue=9 |pages=1–171, iii–iv |journal=Health Technology Assessment |doi=10.3310/hta11090}}</ref> In addition, enrollment in methadone [[Maintenance dose|maintenance]] has the potential to reduce the transmission of infectious diseases associated with opiate injection, such as hepatitis and HIV.<ref name="JosephStancliffLangrod"/> The principal goals of methadone maintenance are to relieve opioid cravings, suppress the abstinence syndrome, and block the euphoric effects associated with opioids. However, methadone abuse does carry the potential for dependence. When used correctly, methadone maintenance has been found to be medically safe and non-sedating, and provides a slow recovery from opioid addiction.<ref name="JosephStancliffLangrod"/> It is also indicated for pregnant women addicted to opioids.<ref name="JosephStancliffLangrod">{{cite journal |pmid=11064485 |year=2000 |last1=Joseph |first1=H |last2=Stancliff |first2=S |last3=Langrod |first3=J |title=Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT): A review of historical and clinical issues |volume=67 |issue=5–6 |pages=347–64 |journal=The Mount Sinai Journal of Medicine}}</ref>

===Pain===
Methadone is used as an [[analgesic]] in chronic pain. Methadone is a very effective pain medication. Due to its activity at the [[NMDA receptor]], it may be more effective against [[neuropathic pain]]; for the same reason, tolerance to the analgesic effects may be less than that of other opioids.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1742-1241.2008.01990.x |title=The role of methadone in cancer pain treatment - a review |year=2009 |last1=Leppert |first1=W. |journal=International Journal of Clinical Practice |volume=63 |issue=7 |pages=1095–109 |pmid=19570126}}</ref><ref name=Cochrane2007>{{cite journal | last1 = Nicholson | first1 = AB | date = Oct 2007 | title = Methadone for cancer pain | url = | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev. | volume = 4 | issue = | page = CD003971 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003971.pub3 | pmid = 17943808 }}</ref>

People with long-term pain will sometimes have to perform so-called ''opioid rotation''.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0885-3924(95)90924-C |title=Opioid rotation for toxicity reduction in terminal cancer patients |year=1995 |last1=De Stoutz |first1=Noe´mi D. |last2=Bruera |first2=Eduardo |last3=Suarez-Almazor |first3=Maria |journal=Journal of Pain and Symptom Management |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=378–84 |pmid=7673770}}</ref> Opioid rotation involves switching from one opioid to another, usually at intervals of between a few weeks, or more commonly, several months. Opioid rotation may allow for a lower equivalent dose, and hence fewer side effects may be encountered to achieve the desired effect. Then, over time, tolerance increases with the new opioid, requiring higher doses. This, in turn, increases the possibility of adverse reactions and toxicity. Then it is time to rotate again to another opioid. Such opioid rotation is standard practice for managing people with tolerance development. Usually when doing opioid rotation, one cannot go down to a completely naive dose, because there is cross-tolerance carried over to the new opioid. However, methadone has a lower cross-tolerance when switching to it from other opioids, than other opioids.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0304-3959(96)03112-0 |title=Individualized use of methadone and opioid rotation in the comprehensive management of cancer pain associated with poor prognostic indicators |year=1996 |last1=Vigano' |first1=Antonio |last2=Fan |first2=David |last3=Bruera |first3=Eduardo |journal=Pain |volume=67 |pages=115–9 |pmid=8895238 |issue=1}}</ref> This means that methadone can start at a comparatively lower dose than other opiates, and the time for the next switch will be longer.

===Opioid detoxification===
Methadone is approved in the US, and many other parts of the world, for the treatment of opioid addiction. Its use for the treatment of addiction is usually strictly regulated. In the US, outpatient treatment programs must be certified by the Federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and registered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in order to prescribe methadone for opioid addiction.

On 29 November 2006, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] issued a Public Health Advisory about methadone titled "Methadone Use for Pain Control May Result in Death and Life-Threatening Changes in Breathing and Heart Beat". The advisory said that "the FDA has received reports of death and life-threatening side effects in patients taking methadone. These deaths and life-threatening side effects have occurred in patients newly starting methadone for pain control and in patients who have switched to methadone after being treated for pain with other strong opioid pain relievers. Methadone can cause slow or shallow breathing and dangerous changes in heartbeat that may not be felt by the patient." The advisory urged that physicians use caution when prescribing methadone to people who are not used to the drug and that people take the drug exactly as directed.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/safety/2006/safety06.htm#Methadone | title = 2006 Safety Alerts for Drugs, Biologics, Medical Devices, and Dietary Supplements | work = MedWatch | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061129174443/http://www.fda.gov/Medwatch/safety/2006/safety06.htm#Methadone | archivedate = 2006-11-29 | df =  }}</ref>

Methadone withdrawal symptoms are reported as being significantly more protracted than withdrawal from opioids with shorter half-lives.

Methadone is sometimes administered as an oral liquid. Methadone has been implicated in contributing to significant [[tooth decay]]. Methadone causes [[xerostomia|dry mouth]], reducing the protective role of [[saliva]] in preventing decay. Other putative mechanisms of methadone-related tooth decay include craving for carbohydrates related to opioids, poor dental care, and general decrease in personal hygiene. These factors, combined with sedation, have been linked to the causation of extensive dental damage.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brondani|first1=M|last2=Park|first2=PE|title=Methadone and oral health--a brief review.|journal=Journal of dental hygiene : JDH / American Dental Hygienists' Association|date=16 May 2011|volume=85|issue=2|pages=92–8|pmid=21619737}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Graham|first1=CH|last2=Meechan|first2=JG|title=Dental management of patients taking methadone.|journal=Dental update|date=October 2005|volume=32|issue=8|pages=477–8, 481–2, 485|pmid=16262036}}</ref>

===Overdose===
Most people who have overdosed on methadone may show some of the following symptoms:
* [[Miosis]] (constricted pupils)<ref name=medline-methadone>{{cite web | url = http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682134.html | title = Methadone (meth' a done) | publisher = National Institutes of Health | work = MedlinePlus | date = 1 February 2009 | accessdate = 23 October 2013 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131017172738/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682134.html | archivedate = 17 October 2013 | df =  }}</ref>

* [[Hypoventilation]] (breathing that is too slow/shallow)<ref name=medline-methadone/>
* [[Drowsiness]],<ref name=medline-methadone/> sleepiness, disorientation, sedation, unresponsiveness
* Skin that is cool, clammy (damp), and pale<ref name=medline-methadone/>

* [[Unconsciousness]]<ref name=medline-methadone/> and [[coma]]<ref name=medline-methadone/>
* Death<ref name=MedlinePlusOverdose/>

The respiratory depression of an overdose can be treated with [[naloxone]].<ref name=sadovsky>{{cite journal | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0715/p428.html | title = Tips from Other Journals – Public Health Issue: Methadone Maintenance Therapy | first = Richard | last = Sadovsky, M.D. | journal = American Family Physician | date = 15 July 2000 | volume = 62 | pages = 428–432 | issue = 2 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150904004312/http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0715/p428.html | archivedate = 4 September 2015 | df =  }}</ref> Naloxone is preferred to the newer, longer acting antagonist [[naltrexone]]. Despite methadone's much longer duration of action compared to either heroin and other shorter-acting agonists, and the need for repeat doses of the antagonist naloxone, it is still used for overdose therapy. As naltrexone has a longer half-life, it is more difficult to titrate. If too large a dose of the opioid antagonist is given to a dependent person, it will result in withdrawal symptoms (possibly severe). When using naloxone, the naloxone will be quickly eliminated and the withdrawal will be short lived. Doses of naltrexone take longer to be eliminated from the person's system. A common problem in treating methadone overdoses is that, given the short action of naloxone (versus the extremely longer-acting methadone), a dosage of naloxone given to a methadone-overdosed person will initially work to bring the person out of overdose, but once the naloxone wears off, if no further naloxone is administered, the person can go right back into overdose (based upon time and dosage of the methadone ingested).

===Tolerance and dependence===
As with other opioid medications, tolerance and dependence usually develop with repeated doses. There is some clinical evidence that tolerance to analgesia is less with methadone compared to other opioids; this may be due to its activity at the NMDA receptor. Tolerance to the different physiological effects of methadone varies; tolerance to analgesic properties may or may not develop quickly, but tolerance to euphoria usually develops rapidly, whereas tolerance to constipation, sedation, and respiratory depression develops slowly (if ever).<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.atforum.com/pdf/DosingandSafetyWP.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Addiction Treatment Forum | date = September 2003 | title = Methadone Dosing & Safety in the Treatment of Opioid Addiction | first = Stewart B. | last = Leavitt}}</ref>

===Mortality===
In the United States, deaths linked to methadone more than quadrupled in the five-year period between 1999 and 2004. According to the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/pubs/pubd/hestats/methadone1999-04/methadone1999-04.htm |title=Increases in Methadone-Related Deaths:1999-2004 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411213556/http://cdc.gov/nchs/products/pubs/pubd/hestats/methadone1999-04/methadone1999-04.htm |archivedate=2010-04-11 |df= }}</ref> as well as a 2006 series in the ''Charleston Gazette'' (West Virginia),<ref name="http://www.wvgazette.com/section/Series/The+Killer+Cure">[http://www.wvgazette.com/section/Series/The+Killer+Cure "The Killer Cure"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618125503/http://wvgazette.com/section/Series/The+Killer+Cure |date=2006-06-18 }} ''The Charleston Gazette'' 2006</ref> medical examiners listed methadone as contributing to 3,849 deaths in 2004. That number was up from 790 in 1999. Approximately 82 percent of those deaths were listed as accidental, and most deaths involved combinations of methadone with other drugs (especially [[benzodiazepines]]).

Although deaths from methadone are on the rise, methadone-associated deaths are not being caused primarily by methadone intended for methadone treatment programs, according to a panel of experts convened by the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]], which released a report titled "Methadone-Associated Mortality, Report of a National Assessment". The consensus report concludes that "although the data remains incomplete, National Assessment meeting participants concurred that methadone tablets or diskettes distributed through channels other than opioid treatment programs most likely are the central factors in methadone-associated mortality."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://alcoholism.about.com/cs/heroin/a/blsam040209.htm |title=Methadone-Associated Mortality, Report of a National Assessment |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101081924/http://alcoholism.about.com/cs/heroin/a/blsam040209.htm |archivedate=2016-01-01 |df= }}</ref>

In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a caution about methadone, titled “Methadone Use for Pain Control May Result in Death.” The FDA also revised the drug's package insert. The change deleted previous information about the usual adult dosage. The ''Charleston Gazette'' reported, "The old language about the 'usual adult dose' was potentially deadly, according to pain specialists."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://wvgazette.com/News/TheKillerCure/200611280003 | newspaper = Charleston Gazette | title = New warning issued on methadone | date = 28 November 2006 | first = Scott | last = Finn | first2 = Tara | last2 = Tuckwiller | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100213212647/http://wvgazette.com/News/TheKillerCure/200611280003 | archivedate = 13 February 2010 | df =  }}</ref>

==Detection in biological fluids==
Methadone and its major metabolite, 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP), are often measured in urine as part of a drug abuse testing program, in plasma or serum to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims, or in whole blood to assist in a forensic investigation of a traffic or other criminal violation or a case of sudden death. Methadone usage history is considered in interpreting the results as a chronic user can develop tolerance to doses that would incapacitate an opioid-naive individual. Chronic users often have high methadone and EDDP baseline values.<ref>{{cite book |first=R. |last=Baselt |title=Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man |edition=8th |publisher=Biomedical Publications |location=Foster City, CA |year=2008 |pages=941–5}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==
Methadone acts by binding to the µ-opioid receptor, but also has some affinity for the [[NMDA]] ionotropic glutamate receptor. Methadone is metabolized by [[CYP3A4]], [[CYP2B6]], [[CYP2D6]] and is a substrate for the P-Glycoprotein efflux protein in the intestine and brain. The bioavailability and elimination half-life of methadone is subject to substantial inter-individual variability. Its main [[route of administration]] is oral. Adverse effects include sedation, [[hypoventilation]], [[constipation]] and [[miosis]], in addition to tolerance, dependence and withdrawal difficulties. The withdrawal period can be much more prolonged than with other opioids, spanning anywhere from two weeks to several months. Many factors contribute to its metabolism and excretion rate including the individual's body weight, history of use/abuse, metabolic dysfunctions, renal system dysfunction, among others.


===Mechanism of action===
[[Levomethadone]] (the ''R'' enantiomer) is a [[μ-opioid receptor]] agonist with higher [[intrinsic activity]] than morphine, but lower affinity.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Davis|editor1-first=MP|editor2-last=Glare|editor2-first=P|editor3-last=Hardy|editor3-first=JR|editor4-last=Columba|editor4-first=Q|title=Opioids in Cancer Pain|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-0-19-923664-0|edition=2nd|pages=211-212}}</ref> [[Dextromethadone]] (the ''S'' enantiomer) does not affect opioid receptors but binds to the [[glutamatergic]] [[NMDA]] (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor, and thus acts as a [[receptor antagonist]] against [[glutamate]]. Methadone has been shown to reduce neuropathic pain in rat models, primarily through NMDA antagonism. Glutamate is the primary excitatory [[neurotransmitter]] in the [[central nervous system|CNS]]. NMDA receptors have a very important role in modulating long-term excitation and memory formation. NMDA antagonists such as [[dextromethorphan]] (DXM), [[ketamine]] (a dissociative anaesthetic, also M.O.A+.), [[tiletamine]] (a veterinary anaesthetic) and [[ibogaine]] (from the African tree [[Tabernanthe iboga]], also M.O.A+.) are being studied for their role in decreasing the development of tolerance to opioids and as possible for eliminating addiction/tolerance/withdrawal, possibly by disrupting memory circuitry. Acting as an NMDA antagonist may be one mechanism by which methadone decreases craving for opioids and tolerance, and has been proposed as a possible mechanism for its distinguished efficacy regarding the treatment of neuropathic pain. The [[dextrorotary]] form ([[d-methadone]]) acts as an NMDA antagonist and is devoid of opioid activity: it has been shown to produce analgesia in experimental models of chronic pain. Methadone also acted as a potent, [[noncompetitive]] [[alpha-3 beta-4 nicotinic receptor|α<sub>3</sub>β<sub>4</sub>]] neuronal [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]] [[nicotinic antagonist|antagonist]] in rat receptors, expressed in human embryonic kidney cell lines.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Xiao |first1=Yingxian |last2=Smith |first2=Richard D. |last3=Caruso |first3=Frank S. |last4=Kellar |first4=Kenneth J. |title=Blockade of Rat α3β4 Nicotinic Receptor Function by Methadone, Its Metabolites, and Structural Analogs |journal=The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics |volume=299 |issue=1 |pages=366–71 |date=October 2001 |pmid=11561100 |url=http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11561100}}</ref>

===Metabolism===
Methadone has a slow metabolism and very high [[Lipophilicity|fat solubility]], making it longer lasting than morphine-based drugs. Methadone has a typical elimination [[half-life]] of 15 to 60 hours with a mean of around 22. However, metabolism rates vary greatly between individuals, up to a factor of 100,<ref name="Kell">{{cite journal |doi=10.1300/J069v13n01_02 |title=Utilization of Plasma and Urine Methadone Concentrations to Optimize Treatment in Maintenance Clinics: |year=1994 |last1=Kell |first1=Michael Jon |journal=Journal of Addictive Diseases |volume=13 |pages=5–26 |pmid=8018740 |issue=1}}</ref><ref name=Europad>{{cite journal |last1=Eap |first1=Chin B.

Many substances can also induce, inhibit or compete with these enzymes further affecting (sometimes dangerously) methadone half-life. A longer half-life frequently allows for administration only once a day in Opioid [[Drug detoxification|detoxification]] and maintenance programs. People who metabolize methadone rapidly, on the other hand, may require twice daily dosing to obtain sufficient symptom alleviation while avoiding excessive peaks and troughs in their blood concentrations and associated effects.<ref name="EapI"/> This can also allow lower total doses in some such people. The analgesic activity is shorter than the pharmacological half-life; dosing for pain control usually requires multiple doses per day.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

===Route of administration===
The most common [[route of administration]] at a methadone clinic is in a [[racemic]] oral solution, though in Germany, only the ''R'' [[enantiomer]] (the [[levorotatory|L]] optical isomer) has traditionally been used, as it is responsible for most of the desired opioid effects.<ref name="EapI"/> The single-isomer form is becoming less common due to the higher production costs.

Methadone is available in traditional pill, [[sublingual]] tablet, and two different formulations designed for the person to drink. Drinkable forms include ready-to-dispense liquid (sold in the [[United States]] as Methadose), and "Diskets" which are tablets designed to disperse themselves rapidly in water for oral administration, used in a similar fashion to [[Alka-Seltzer]]. The liquid form is the most common as it allows for smaller dose changes. Methadone is almost as effective when administered orally as by injection. In fact, injection of methadone does not result in a "[[Rush (psychology)|rush]]" as with some other strong opioids such as [[morphine]] or [[hydromorphone]], because its extraordinarily high [[pharmacokinetics|volume of distribution]] causes it to diffuse into other tissues in the body, particularly fatty tissue; the peak concentration in the blood is achieved at roughly the same time, whether the drug is injected or ingested.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Oral medication is usually preferable because it offers safety, simplicity and represents a step away from injection-based drug abuse in those recovering from addiction.

==History==

Methadone was developed in 1937 in Germany by scientists working for [[I.G.

Farbenkonzern at the Farbwerke Hoechst were confiscated by the U.S. Department of Commerce Intelligence, investigated by a Technical Industrial Committee of the U.S. Department of State and then brought to the US.<ref name=JanssenHist/>   The report published by the committee noted that while methadone was potentially addictive, it produced less sedation and respiratory depression than morphine and was thus interesting as a commercial drug.<ref name=JanssenHist/>

In the early 1950s, methadone (most times the racemic HCl salts mixture) was also investigated for use as an antitussive.<ref>J Pharmacol Exp Ther November 1979 211:401-408</ref>

From this research came a generally non-controlled—or controlled for having the same precursors and effects of strong pure agonist agents of the open chain type, this one a phenaloxam derivative, [[levopropoxyphene]] with optical isomerism and one of which appeared to have no narcotic properties but was an antitussive which did have dissociative effects if misused; the isomer form which is removed from the racemic salts to yield dextromethorphan, or remove the other isomer to purify a dextropropoxyphene, or left in to finish with a racemic salts mixture [[dimethorphan]].<ref>Appleton & Lange's 2003 Nursing Drug Guide, pp 177</ref>  The open chain opioids tend to have at least one isomer that is at some level a strong pure mu opioid receptor agent.<ref>The Oxford Textbook of Pharmacology & Clinical Drug</ref>
 
[[Isomethadone]], [[noracymethadol]], [[levacetylmethadol|LAAM]], and [[normethadone]] were first developed in Germany, United Kingdom, Belgium, Austria, Canada, and the United States in the thirty or so years after the 1937 discovery of [[pethidine]], the first synthetic opioid used in medicine, prolonging and increasing length and depth of satiating any opiate cravings and generating very strong analgesia (the long metabolic half-life and the strong receptor affinity at the mu opioid receptor sites, therefore imparting much of the satiating and anti-addictive effects of methadone) by means of suppressing drug cravings and the discovery in the early 1950s.<ref>Morphine & Allied Drugs, Reynolds et al 1957 Ch 8</ref> of methadone's [[antitussive]] properties first tested in dogs in Europe in 1952-1955 with different inert placebos, active placebos like [[codeine]].<ref>Morphine & Allied Drugs, 1957 Ch 8</ref>

It was only in 1947 that the drug was given the generic name “methadone” by the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry of the American Medical Association. Since the patent rights of the I.G. Farbenkonzern and Farbwerke Hoechst were no longer protected each pharmaceutical company interested in the formula could buy the rights for the commercial production of methadone for just one dollar (MOLL 1990).

Methadone was introduced into the United States in 1947 by [[Eli Lilly and Company]] as an analgesic under the trade name Dolophine,<ref name=JanssenHist/> which is now registered to [[Roxane Laboratories]]. Since then, it has been best known for its use in treating opioid dependence. A great deal of anecdotal evidence was available "on the street" that methadone might prove effective in treating heroin withdrawal and is not uncommonly used in hospitals and other de-addiction centers to enhance rates of completed opioid withdrawal. It was not until studies performed at the [[Rockefeller University]] in New York City by Professor [[Vincent Dole]], along with [[Marie Nyswander]] and [[Mary Jeanne Kreek]], that methadone was systematically studied as a potential substitution therapy. Their studies introduced a sweeping change in the notion that drug addiction was not necessarily a simple character flaw, but rather a disorder to be treated in the same way as other diseases. To date, methadone maintenance therapy has been the most systematically studied and most successful,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} and most politically polarizing, of any pharmacotherapy for the treatment of people with drug addiction.

Methadone was first manufactured in the US by Eli Lilly, who obtained FDA approval on August 14, 1947, for their Dolophine 5&nbsp;mg and 10&nbsp;mg Tablets. Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals did not receive approval until December 15, 1947 to manufacture their bulk compounding powder. Mallinckrodt received approval for their branded generic, Methadose, on April 15, 1993 for their 5&nbsp;mg and 10&nbsp;mg Methadose Tablets. Mallinckrodt who also makes 5&nbsp;mg, 10&nbsp;mg and 40&nbsp;mg generic tablets in addition to their branded generic Methadose received approval for their plain generic tablets on April 27, 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814072104/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/Scripts/cder/DrugsatFDA/index.cfm |archivedate=2012-08-14 |df= }}{{full citation needed|date=December 2013}}</ref>

The trade name Dolophine was created by Eli Lilly after World War II and used in the United States; the claim that [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] leader [[Adolf Hitler]] ordered the manufacture of methadone or that the brand name 'Dolophine' was named after him is an urban legend.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=The History of Methadone and Methadone Prescribing. |last1=Preston |first1=A. |last2=Bennett |first2=G. |title=In: Methadone Matters.

==Society and culture==

===Brand names===
Brand names include Dolophine, Symoron, Amidone, Methadose, Physeptone, and Heptadon among others.

===Cost===

====Methadone maintenance treatment====
Methadone maintenance clinics in the US charge anywhere from $5 to $400 per week, which may be covered by private insurance or [[Medicaid]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In Germany, methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is fully covered by all public and private insurance plans. The annual cost per person is less than 3000 euros, while [[heroin-assisted treatment]] costs up to 10,000 euros per year.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

MMT cost analyses often compare the cost of clinic visits versus the overall societal costs of illicit opioid use.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.drugpolicy.org/library/research/methadone.cfm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030511203202/http://www.drugpolicy.org/library/research/methadone.cfm#note3 | archivedate=2003-05-11 |title=Methadone Maintenance Treatment | publisher=Drug Policy Alliance Lindesmith Library}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://international.drugabuse.gov/collaboration/guide_methadone/partb_question15.html |title=Methadone Research Web Guide |publisher=NIDA |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215142535/http://international.drugabuse.gov/collaboration/guide_methadone/partb_question15.html |archivedate=2010-02-15 |df= }}</ref>

As of 2015 China had the largest methadone maintenance treatment program with over 250,000 people in over 650 clinics in 27 provinces.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sullivan|first1=Sheena G.|last2=Wu|first2=Zunyou|last3=Rou|first3=Keming|last4=Pang|first4=Lin|last5=Luo|first5=Wei|last6=Wang|first6=Changhe|last7=Cao|first7=Xiaobin|last8=Yin|first8=Wenyuan|last9=Liu|first9=Enwu|last10=Mi|first10=Guodong|title=Who uses methadone services in China?

===Controversy===
Methadone substitution as a treatment of opioid addiction has been widely criticized in the social sciences for its role in social control of addicts.<ref name=Bennett2011>{{cite journal|last1=Bennett|first1=C|title=Methadone Maintenance Treatment: Disciplining the "Addict"|journal=Health and history|date=2011|volume=13|issue=2|pages=130–57|doi=10.5401/healthhist.13.2.0130|pmid=22329263}}</ref> It is suggested that methadone does not function as much to curb addiction as to redirect it and maintain dependency on authorised channels. Several authors apply a [[Foucauldian discourse analysis|Foucauldian analysis]] to the widespread prescription of the drug and use in institutions such as prisons, hospitals and rehabilitation centres.<ref name=Bergschmidt2004>Bergschmidt V (2004) 'Pleasure, Power, and Dangerous Substances: Applying Foucault to the study of "Heroin Dependence" in Germany' Anthropology and Medicine Vol. 11 (1) pp. 59-73</ref> Such critique centers on the notion that substance addiction is reframed with a disease model. Thus methadone, which mimics the effects of opioids and renders the addict compliant, is labeled as a “treatment” and so obscures the disciplinary objectives of “managing undesirables”.<ref name=Bennett2011/>

===Regulation===
Methadone is a Schedule II controlled substance in the United States, with an ACSCN of 9250 and a 2014 annual aggregate manufacturing quota of 31 875 kilos for sale. [[Methadone intermediate]] is also controlled, under ACSCN 9226 also under Schedule II, with a quota of 38 875 kilos. In most countries of the world, methadone is similarly restricted. The salts of methadone in use are the hydrobromide (free base conversion ratio 0.793), hydrochloride (0.894), and HCl monohydrate (0.850).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/quotas/conv_factor/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302162948/http://deadiversion.usdoj.gov/quotas/conv_factor/index.html |archivedate=2016-03-02 |df= }}</ref> Methadone is also regulated internationally as a Schedule I controlled substance under the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/quotas/2014/fr0825.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053357/http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/quotas/2014/fr0825.htm |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}</ref><ref name="Nordegren2002">{{cite book | author = Thomas Nordegren | title = The A-Z Encyclopedia of Alcohol and Drug Abuse | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4yaGePenGKgC&pg=PA366 | accessdate = 16 May 2012 | date = 1 March 2002 | publisher = Universal-Publishers | isbn = 978-1-58112-404-0 | page = 366 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140101085353/http://books.google.com/books?id=4yaGePenGKgC&pg=PA366 | archivedate = 1 January 2014 | df =  }}</ref>

In [[Russia]], methadone treatment is illegal. [[Gennadiy Onishchenko]], Chief Sanitary Inspector, claimed in 2008 that health officials are not convinced of the treatment's efficacy. Instead, doctors encourage immediate cessation of drug use, rather than the gradual process that methadone substitution therapy entails. People are often given [[sedative]]s and non-opioid [[analgesic]]s to cope with withdrawal symptoms.<ref>{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Schwirtz |title=Russia Scorns Methadone for Heroin Addiction |work=The New York Times |date=July 22, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/22/health/22meth.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161207145850/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/22/health/22meth.html |archivedate=December 7, 2016 |df= }}</ref>
