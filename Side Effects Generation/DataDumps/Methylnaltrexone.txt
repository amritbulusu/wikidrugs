'''Methylnaltrexone''' ('''MNTX''', brand name '''Relistor'''), used in form of '''methylnaltrexone bromide''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]]), is one of the newer agents of peripherally acting [[Mu opioid receptor|μ-opioid]] [[Receptor antagonist|antagonists]] that act to reverse some of the side effects of [[opioid]] drugs such as [[constipation]] without affecting [[analgesia]] or precipitating [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]]s. Because MNTX is a [[quaternary ammonium cation]], it cannot cross the [[blood–brain barrier]], and so has antagonist effects throughout the body, counteracting effects such as [[itching]] and constipation, but without affecting opioid effects in the brain such as analgesia.<ref name="npsradar">{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.org.au/health_professionals/publications/nps_radar/2010/march_2010/methylnaltrexone |title=Methylnaltrexone injections (Relistor) for opioid-induced constipation in palliative care |author=National Prescribing Service |date=1 March 2010 |accessdate=12 March 2010}}</ref> However, since a significant fraction (up to 60%) of opioid analgesia can be mediated by opioid receptors on peripheral sensory neurons, particularly in inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, traumatic or surgical pain,<ref name="Stein C, Lang LJ (2009)">Stein C, Lang LJ (2009) Peripheral mechanisms of opioid analgesia.

==Medical uses==
Methylnaltrexone is approved for the treatment of [[opioid-induced constipation]] (OIC). It is generally only to be used when ordinary [[laxatives]] have failed.

==Mechanism of action==
Methylnaltrexone binds to the same receptors as opioid analgesics such as morphine, but it acts as an antagonist, blocking the effects of those analgesics, specifically the constipating effects on the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, as methylnaltrexone cannot cross the blood–brain barrier, it does not reverse the pain-killing properties of opioid agonists or cause withdrawal symptoms. Methylnaltrexone is unable to enter the brain primarily because it carries a positive charge on its nitrogen atom. This is the primary difference that makes methylnaltrexone behave differently from [[naltrexone]].<ref name="FDALabel">{{cite web |url=http://www.wyeth.com/content/showlabeling.asp?id=499 |title=Relistor Full Prescribing Information|accessdate=2009-05-09|format=|work=}}</ref>

== History ==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2010}}
In 1978 a colleague presented Leon Goldberg with a clinical challenge. One of his patients, struggling with the pain of prostatic cancer that had metastasized to his bones, was now declining the morphine he required for analgesia because of constipation. Research on opioids which would target only the sub-types of receptors associated with pain relief and not with side effects had seen little success outside of in-vitro models. Considering drugs such as [[loperamide]], which acted on the opioid receptors in the gut without acting on the central nervous system, Goldberg proposed a targeted opioid receptor antagonist.

Thousands of opioid-like molecules had been synthesized by pharmaceutical companies looking for the better analgesic - and many of those with no pain relieving properties had been shelved. Screening these compounds led to the examination of putative antagonists which when modified had properties that suggested they might not readily cross the blood–brain barrier based on their size and charge. One of these compounds, N-methyl-naltrexone (MNTX), was amongst a group of compounds synthesized by Boehringer Ingelheim.<ref>{{cite patent|country=US|number=3101339|status=patent|title=Quaternary salts of normorphine and its acylated derivatives|gdate=1963-08-20|fdate=1959-10-26|pridate=1958-10-30|inventor=Karl Zeile and Kurt Freter|invent1=Zeile, Karl|invent2=Freter, Kurt|assign1=C.

Research on methylnaltrexone continued in the Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care at the University of Chicago through the 1990s. More recent investigations, however, discovered opioid receptors on peripheral sensory neurons.<ref name="Stein C, Schäfer M, Machelska H (2003)">Stein C, Schäfer M, Machelska H (2003) Attacking pain at its source: new perspectives on opioids.

In December 2005, [[Wyeth]] and Progenics entered into an exclusive, worldwide agreement for the joint development and commercialization of methylnaltrexone for the treatment of opioid-induced side effects, including constipation and post-operative [[ileus]] (POI), a prolonged dysfunction of the gastrointestinal tract following surgery. Under the terms of the agreement, the companies are collaborating on worldwide development. Wyeth received worldwide rights to commercialize methylnaltrexone, and Progenics retained an option to co-promote the product in the United States. Wyeth will pay Progenics royalties on worldwide sales and co-promotion fees within the United States.

Methylnaltrexone is being developed in subcutaneous and oral forms to treat opioid induced constipation (OIC).

The use of methylnaltrexone (Relistor) for more than 4 months has not been studied.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wyeth.com/hcp/relistor/information-14 |title=Relistor Dosage and Administration |publisher=Wyeth |accessdate=2010-08-12}}</ref>

===Forms===
As of 2010, methylnaltrexone is supplied as an injection in trays containing seven one dose vials containing 0.6 mL of solution. Each tray also contains seven {{convert|12|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} 1 mL 27 gauge needles with retractable tips, and alcohol wipes for home use. A single vial can treat someone who weighs as much as {{convert|115|kg|lb}}.<ref name="FDALabel" />  For hospital use, vials are available separately.
