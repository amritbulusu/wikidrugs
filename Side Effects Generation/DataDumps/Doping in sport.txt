{{Doping in sport sidebar|expanded=History}}
In competitive sports, '''doping''' refers to the use of banned [[ergogenic aid|athletic performance-enhancing drugs]] by athletic competitors, where the term ''doping'' is widely used by organizations that regulate sporting competitions. The use of banned drugs to enhance performance is considered unethical, and therefore prohibited, by most international sports organizations, including the [[International Olympic Committee]]. Furthermore, athletes (or athletic programs) taking explicit measures to evade detection exacerbates the ethical violation with overt [[deception]] and [[cheating]].

Historically speaking, the origins of doping in sports go back to the very creation of sport itself. From ancient usage of substances in [[chariot racing]] to more recent controversies in [[baseball]] and [[cycling]], popular views among athletes have varied widely from country to country over the years. The general trend among authorities and sporting organizations over the past several decades has been to strictly regulate the use of drugs in sport. The reasons for the ban are mainly the health risks of performance-enhancing drugs, the equality of opportunity for athletes, and the exemplary effect of drug-free sport for the public. Anti-doping authorities state that using performance-enhancing drugs goes against the "spirit of sport".

==History==
The use of drugs in sports goes back centuries, about all the way back to the very invention of the concept of sports.<ref name=against/> In ancient times, when the fittest of a nation were selected as athletes or combatants, they were fed diets and given treatments considered beneficial. For instance, Scandinavian mythology says [[Berserkers]] could drink a mixture called "butotens", to greatly increase their physical power at the risk of insanity.  One theory is that the mixture was prepared from the ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' mushroom, though this has been disputed. The German missionary and doctor [[Albert Schweitzer]] wrote of [[Gabon]] in the early 19th century: "The people of the country can, having eaten certain leaves or roots, toil vigorously all day without feeling hungry, thirsty or tired and all the time showing a happiness and gaiety."<ref>Schweitzer, Albert: À l'Orée de la Forêt Vierge, récits et réflexions d'un médecin en Afrique équatoriale française, Albin Michel, France 1952</ref>

The [[Ancient Olympic Games|ancient Olympics in Greece]] have been alleged to have been contaminated with forms of doping. In [[ancient Rome]], where [[chariot racing]] had become a huge part of their culture, athletes drank [[Herbs|herbal infusions]] to strengthen them before chariot races.<ref name=against>{{cite journal|url=http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/44/Suppl_1/i8.3|title=Competing against doping|first=Rajesh|last=Kumar|date=1 September 2010|publisher=|journal=Br J Sports Med|volume=44|issue=Suppl 1|pages=i8–i8|accessdate=9 June 2016|via=bjsm.bmj.com|doi=10.1136/bjsm.2010.078725.23}}</ref>

More recently, a participant in an endurance [[Pedestrianism|walking race]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], Abraham Wood, said in 1807 that he had used [[laudanum]] (which contains [[opiates]]) to keep him awake for 24&nbsp;hours while competing against Robert Barclay Allardyce.<ref name=DeMon/> By April 1877, walking races had stretched to 500 miles and the following year, also at the Agricultural Hall in [[Islington]], London, to 520 miles. The ''Illustrated London News'' chided:

:It may be an advantage to know that a man can travel 520 miles in 138 hours, and manage to live through a week with an infinitesimal amount of rest, though we fail to perceive that anyone could possibly be placed in a position where his ability in this respect would be of any use to him [and] what is to be gained by a constant repetition of the fact.<ref>Grajewski, Tadeusw: The Building That Would Not Go Away, Royal Agriciultural Hall, UK, 1989</ref>

The event proved popular, however, with 20,000 spectators attending each day.<ref name=TIR>Woodland, Les: This Island Race, Mousehold Press, UK, 2005</ref> Encouraged, the promoters developed the idea and soon held similar races for cyclists.

:"...and much more likely to endure their miseries publicly; a tired walker, after all, merely sits down – a tired cyclist falls off and possibly brings others crashing down as well. That's much more fun".<ref name=TIR/>

The fascination with six-day bicycle races spread across the Atlantic and the same appeal brought in the crowds in America as well. And the more spectators paid at the gate, the higher the prizes could be and the greater was the incentive of riders to stay awake—or be kept awake—to ride the greatest distance. Their exhaustion was countered by [[soigneurs]] (the French word for "carers"), helpers akin to seconds in [[boxing]]. Among the treatments they supplied was [[nitroglycerine]], a drug used to stimulate the heart after cardiac attacks and which was credited with improving riders' breathing.<ref>Novich, Max M., ''Abbotempo'', UK, 1964</ref> Riders suffered hallucinations from the exhaustion and perhaps the drugs. The American champion [[Major Taylor]] refused to continue the New York race, saying: "I cannot go on with safety, for there is a man chasing me around the ring with a knife in his hand."<ref>Bearings, US, 24 December 1896, cited Ritchie, Andrew, ''Major Taylor'', Bicycle Books, US, 1988</ref>

Public reaction turned against such trials, whether individual races or in teams of two. One report said:

:An athletic contest in which the participants 'go queer' in their heads, and strain their powers until their faces become hideous with the tortures that rack them, is not sport, it is brutality. It appears from the reports of this singular performance that some of the bicycle riders have actually become temporarily insane during the contest... Days and weeks of recuperation will be needed to put the racers in condition, and it is likely that some of them will never recover from the strain.<ref>New York Times, US, 1897, cited McCullagh, James, ''American Bicycle Racing, Rodale Press, U.S., 1976</ref>

The father of [[anabolic steroid]]s in the United States was [[John Bosley Ziegler|John Ziegler]] (1917–1983), a physician for the U.S. weightlifting team in the mid-20th century. In 1954, on his tour to Vienna with his team for the world championship, Ziegler learned from his Russian colleague that the Soviet weightlifting team's success was due to their use of [[testosterone]] as a performance-enhancing drug. Deciding that U.S. athletes needed chemical assistance to remain competitive, Ziegler worked with the CIBA Pharmaceutical Company to develop an oral anabolic steroid. This resulted in the creation of [[methandrostenolone]], which appeared on the market in 1960. During the Olympics that year, the Danish cyclist [[Knud Enemark Jensen]] collapsed and died while competing in the 100-kilometer (62-mile) race. An autopsy later revealed the presence of [[amphetamine]]s and a drug called [[nicotinyl tartrate]] in his system.

The American specialist in doping, Max M. Novich, wrote: "Trainers of the old school who supplied treatments which had cocaine as their base declared with assurance that a rider tired by a six-day race would get his second breath after absorbing these mixtures."<ref>Novich, ibid. Cited De Mondenard, Dr Jean-Pierre: ''Dopage, l'imposture des performances, Chiron, France, 2000</ref> John Hoberman, a professor at the University of Texas in Austin, Texas, said six-day races were "de facto experiments investigating the physiology of stress as well as the substances that might alleviate exhaustion."<ref>Hoberman, John; Dopers on Wheels: The Tour's sorry history, www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19462071/ retrieved December 2007</ref>

== Prevalence ==
Over 30 % of athletes participating in 2011 World Championships admitted having used banned substances during their careers. According to a study commissioned by WADA, actually 44% of them had used them. Nevertheless, only 0.5% of those tested were caught.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-017-0765-4|title=Doping in Two Elite Athletics Competitions Assessed by Randomized-Response Surveys|journal=Sports Medicine|publisher=Springer|year=2017|pages=1-9|author=Ulrich, R. et al.|doi=10.1007/s40279-017-0765-4}}</ref><ref name=bbcsport>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/41084175|title=Doping: More than 30% of athletes at 2011 Worlds admit to doping|date=August 29, 2017|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref>

The whole Russian track and field team was banned from the 2016 Olympic Games, because the Russian State had sponsored their doping program.<ref name=bbcsport/>

===Goldman's dilemma===
{{main article|Goldman's dilemma}}
Goldman's dilemma, or the Goldman dilemma, is a question that was posed to elite [[sportsperson|athletes]] by [[physician]], [[osteopathy|osteopath]] and [[publicist]] Bob Goldman, asking whether they would take a drug that would guarantee them success in sport, but cause them to die after five years. In his research, as in previous research by Mirkin, approximately half the athletes responded that they would take the drug,<ref name=Goldman1992>{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Robert|title=Death in the locker room: drugs & sports|year=1992|publisher=Elite Sports Medicine Publications|isbn=9780963145109|page=24|edition=2nd|author2=Ronald Klatz}}</ref> but modern research by James Connor and co-workers has yielded much lower numbers, with athletes having levels of acceptance of the dilemma that were similar to the general population of Australia.<ref name=Connor2013>{{cite journal|last=Connor|first=James|first2=Jules |last2=Woolf |first3=Jason |last3=Mazanov|title=Would they dope?

== By substance ==

=== Steroids ===
Over the last 20 years the appearance of steroids in sports has been seen as an epidemic. Research and limited tests have been conducted only to find short-term, reversible effects on athletes that are both physical and mental. These side effects would be alleviated if athletes would be allowed the use of  controlled substances under proper medical supervision. These side-effects include Intramuscular abscesses and other microbial bacteria that can cause infections, from counterfeited products the user decides to purchase on the black market, high blood pressure and cholesterol, as well as infertility, and dermatological conditions like severe acne. Mental effects include increased aggression, depression, and in rare cases suicide has been seen as well. Most studies on the effects of steroids have shown to be improper and lacking credible tests as well as performing studies in a skewed fashion to predetermine the world’s view on the use of steroids in sports. Long-term effects have not been able to be pinpointed just yet due to the recency of testing these substances but would start show up as early steroid users reach the age of 50 and older.

====Strychnine at the Olympics====
[[File:Marathon Hicks1904.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Hicks and supporters at the [[1904 Summer Olympics]].]]
These "de facto experiments investigating the physiology of stress as well as the substances that might alleviate exhaustion" were not unknown outside cycling.

[[Thomas Hicks (athlete)|Thomas Hicks]], an American born in England on 7 January 1875, won the [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[marathon (sports)|marathon]] in 1904. He crossed the line behind a fellow American [[Fred Lorz]], who had been transported for 11 miles of the course by his trainer, leading to his disqualification. However, Hicks's trainer Charles Lucas, pulled out a [[syringe]] and came to his aid as his runner began to struggle.

:I therefore decided to inject him with a milligram of sulphate of [[strychnine]] and to make him drink a large glass brimming with brandy. He set off again as best he could [but] he needed another injection four miles from the end to give him a semblance of speed and to get him to the finish.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Parienté|first1=R|last2=Lagorce|first2=G|title=La Fabuleuse Histoire des Jeux Olympiques|publisher=ODIL|location=France|year=1973|isbn=2-8307-0583-1}}</ref>

The use of strychnine, at the time, was thought necessary to survive demanding races, according to sports historians Alain Lunzenfichter<ref>{{cite news|last=Lunzenfichter|first=Alain|title=C'est pas du Jeu!|work=L'Équipe|location=France|date=10 December 2007}}</ref> and historian of sports doping, Dr Jean-Pierre de Mondenard, who said:

:It has to be appreciated that at the time the menace of doping for the health of athletes or of the purity of competition had yet to enter the morals because, after this marathon, the official race report said: The marathon has shown from a medical point of view how drugs can be very useful to athletes in long-distance races.<ref name=DeMon/>

Hicks was, in the phrase of the time, "between life and death" but recovered, collected his gold medal a few days later, and lived until 1952. Nonetheless, he never again took part in athletics.<ref>{{cite book|last=Woodland|first=Les|title=Dope, the use of drugs in Sport|publisher=David and Charles|location=UK|year=1980|isbn=0-7153-7894-5}}</ref>

===Stimulants===
Stimulants are drugs that usually act on the central nervous system to modulate mental function and behavior, increasing an individual's sense of excitement and decreasing the sensation of fatigue.  In the World Anti-Doping Agency list of prohibited substances, stimulants are the second largest class after the anabolic steroids.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Deventer|first1=K|last2=Roels|first2=K|last3=Delbeke|first3=FT|last4=Van Eenoo|first4=P|title=Prevalence of legal and illegal stimulating agents in sports.|journal=Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry|date=August 2011|volume=401|issue=2|pages=421–32|pmid=21479548|doi=10.1007/s00216-011-4863-0}}</ref>  Examples of well known stimulants include [[caffeine]], [[cocaine]], [[amphetamine]], [[modafinil]], and [[ephedrine]]. Caffeine, although a stimulant has not been banned by the International Olympic Committee or the World Anti Doping Agency since 2004.<ref>http://www.usada.org/wp-content/uploads/wada-2016-prohibited-list-en.pdf</ref>

[[Benzedrine]] is a trade name for amphetamine. The Council of Europe says it first appeared in sport at the Berlin Olympics in 1936.<ref>''Doping of athletes, a European survey'', Council of Europe, France, 1964</ref> It was produced in 1887 and the derivative, Benzedrine, was isolated in the U.S. in 1934 by [[Gordon Alles]]. Its perceived effects gave it the street name "speed". British troops used 72&nbsp;million amphetamine tablets in the Second World War<ref name=DeMon/>  and the RAF got through so many that "Methedrine won the Battle of Britain" according to one report.<ref>Grant, D.N.W.; ''Air Force, UK, 1944</ref> The problem was that amphetamine leads to a lack of judgement and a willingness to take risks, which in sport could lead to better performances but in fighters and bombers led to more crash landings than the RAF could tolerate. The drug was withdrawn but large stocks remained on the black market. Amphetamine was also used legally as an aid to slimming and also as a [[thymoleptic]] before being phased out by the appearance of newer agents in the 1950s.

[[Everton F.C.|Everton]], one of the top clubs in the English [[association football|football]] league, were champions of the 1962–63 season. And it was done, according to a national newspaper investigation, with the help of Benzedrine. Word spread after Everton's win that the drug had been involved. The newspaper investigated, cited where the reporter believed it had come from, and quoted the goalkeeper, Albert Dunlop, as saying:

:I cannot remember how they first came to be offered to us. But they were distributed in the dressing rooms. We didn't have to take them but most of the players did. The tablets were mostly white but once or twice they were yellow. They were used through the 1961–62 season and the championship season which followed it. Drug-taking had previously been virtually unnamed in the club. But once it had started we could have as many tablets as we liked. On match days they were handed out to most players as a matter of course. Soon some of the players could not do without the drugs.<ref name=Gabbert>Gabbert, Michael: How we uncovered the Everton drug scandal, ''The People'', UK, 13 September 1964</ref>

The club agreed that drugs had been used but that they "could not possibly have had any harmful effect." Dunlop, however, said he had become an addict.<ref name=Gabbert/>

In November 1942, the Italian cyclist [[Fausto Coppi]] took "seven packets of amphetamine" to beat the world hour record on the track.<ref>Brera, G. ''Le Géant et la Lime'' (French title), Ed. Campagnolo, Italy, 1995, cited De Mondenard</ref> In 1960, the Danish rider [[Knud Enemark Jensen]] collapsed during the 100&nbsp;km team time trial at the Olympic Games in Rome and died later in hospital. The autopsy showed he had taken amphetamine and another drug, [[Nicotinyl alcohol|Ronicol]], which dilates the blood vessels. The chairman of the Dutch cycling federation, Piet van Dijk, said of Rome that "dope – whole cartloads – [were] used in such royal quantities."<ref>Van Dijk, Pieter: ''Doping bestaat en doen we eraan'', Het Vrije Volk, Holland, 13 December 1961</ref>

The 1950s British cycling professional Jock Andrews would joke: "You need never go off-course chasing the peloton in a big race – just follow the trail of empty syringes and dope wrappers."<ref>Cited by fellow professional Tony Hewson in Journal, Fellowship of Cycling Old Timers, 158/72</ref>

The Dutch cycling team manager Kees Pellenaars told of a rider in his care:

:I took him along to a training camp in Spain. The boy changed then into a sort of lion. He raced around as though he was powered by rockets. I went to talk to him. He was really happy he was riding well and he told me to look out for him. I asked if he wasn't perhaps "using something" and he jumped straight up, climbed on a chair and from deep inside a cupboard he pulled out a plastic bag full of pills. I felt my heart skip a beat. I had never seen so many fireworks together. With a [[soigneur]] we counted the pills: there were 5,000 of them, excluding hormone preparations and sleeping pills. I took them away, to his own relief. I let him keep the hormones and the sleeping pills. Later he seemed to have taken too many at once and he slept for a couple of days on end. We couldn't wake him up. We took him to hospital and they pumped out his stomach. They tied him to his bed to prevent anything going wrong again. But one way or another he had some stimulant and fancied taking a walk. A nurse came across him in the corridor, walking along with the bed strapped to his back.<ref>Huyskens, P: ''Daar was 't, een biografie van Kees Pellenaars'', Netherlands,1973</ref>

Currently [[modafinil]] is being used throughout the sporting world, with many high-profile cases attracting press coverage as prominent United States athletes have tested positive for this substance. Some athletes who were found to have used modafinil protested as the drug was not on the prohibited list at the time of their offence, however, the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) maintains it is a substance related to those already banned, so the decisions stand. [[Modafinil]] was added to the list of prohibited substances on 3 August 2004, ten days before the start of the [[2004 Summer Olympics]].

One approach of athletes to get around regulations on stimulants is to use new designer stimulants, which have not previously been officially prohibited, but have similar chemical structures or biological effects.  Designer stimulants that attracted media attention in 2010 included mephendrone, ephendrome, and fluoroamphetamines; which have chemical structures and effects similar to ephedrine and amphetamine.

===Anabolic steroids===
{{Main article|Ergogenic use of anabolic steroids|Anabolic steroid}}
Anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) were first isolated, identified and [[chemical synthesis|synthesized]] in the 1930s, and are now used therapeutically in [[medicine]] to induce [[bone]] growth, stimulate [[appetite]], induce male [[puberty]], and treat chronic [[wasting]] conditions, such as [[cancer]] and [[AIDS]]. Anabolic steroids also increase muscle mass and physical strength, and are therefore used in [[sports]] and [[bodybuilding]] to enhance strength or physique. Known side effects include harmful changes in [[cholesterol]] levels (increased [[Low density lipoprotein]] and decreased [[High density lipoprotein]]), [[Acne vulgaris|acne]], [[high blood pressure]], and [[hepatotoxicity|liver damage]]. Some of these effects can be mitigated by taking supplemental drugs.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kanayama G, Hudson JI, Pope HG |title=Long-term psychiatric and medical consequences of anabolic-androgenic steroid abuse: A looming public health concern? |journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence |volume=98 |issue=1–2 |pages=1–12 |date=November 2008 |pmid=18599224 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2008.05.004 |url= |pmc=2646607}}</ref>

AAS use in sports began in October 1954 when [[John Bosley Ziegler|John Ziegler]], a doctor who treated American athletes, went to [[Vienna]] with the American weightlifting team. There he met a Russian physician who, over "a few drinks", repeatedly asked "What are you giving your boys?"  When Ziegler returned the question, the Russian said that his own athletes were being given testosterone. Returning to America, Ziegler tried low doses of testosterone on himself, on the American trainer Bob Hoffman and on two lifters, Jim Park and Yaz Kuzahara. All gained more weight and strength than any training programme would produce but there were side-effects.<ref>Laure, P.: Les répresentations du dopage; approche psycho-sociologique, Thèse STAPS, Nancy, France, 1994</ref> Ziegler sought a drug without after-effects and hit on an anabolic steroid, [[methandrostenolone]], (Dianabol, DBOL), made in the US in 1958 by [[Ciba Specialty Chemicals|Ciba]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yesalis CE, Anderson WA, Buckley WE, Wright JE |title=Incidence of the nonmedical use of anabolic-androgenic steroids |journal=NIDA research monograph |volume=102 |issue= |pages=97–112 |year=1990 |pmid=2079979 |doi= |url=http://www.drugabuse.gov/pdf/monographs/102.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Fair JD |title=Isometrics or Steroids?

The results were so impressive that lifters began taking more, and steroids spread to other sports. Paul Lowe, a former running back with the San Diego Chargers American football team, told a California legislative committee on drug abuse in 1970: "We had to take them [steroids] at lunchtime. He [an official] would put them on a little saucer and prescribed them for us to take them and if not he would suggest there might be a fine."

Olympic statistics show the weight of shot putters increased 14 percent between 1956 and 1972, whereas steeplechasers weight increased 7.6 per cent. The gold medalist pentathlete [[Mary Peters (athlete)|Mary Peters]] said: "A medical research team in the United States attempted to set up extensive research into the effects of steroids on weightlifters and throwers, only to discover that there were so few who weren't taking them that they couldn't establish any worthwhile comparisons."<ref>Peters, Mary: Mary P, Arrow Books, UK, 1976</ref> In 1984, [[Jay Silvester]], a former four-time Olympian and 1972 silver medalist in the discus, who was then with the physical education department of Brigham Young University in the U.S., questioned competitors at that year's Olympics.<ref>{{Cite web|title = USATF – Hall of Fame|url = http://www.usatf.org/HallOfFame/TF/showBio.asp?HOFIDs=154|website = www.usatf.org|accessdate = 17 July 2015}}</ref> The range of steroid use he found ranged from 10&nbsp;mg a day to 100&nbsp;mg.

However, drug testing can be wildly inconsistent and, in some instances, has gone unenforced.

A number of studies measuring anabolic steroid use in high school athletes found that out of all 12th grade students, 6.6 percent of them had used anabolic steroids at some point in their high school careers or were approached and counseled to use them.  Of those students who acknowledged doping with anabolic–androgenic steroids, well over half participated in school-sponsored athletics, including football, wrestling, track and field, and baseball.  A second study showed 6.3 percent of high school student Football players admitted to current or former AAS use. At the collegiate level, surveys show that AAS use among athletes range from 5 percent to 20 percent and continues to rise. The study found that skin changes were an early marker of steroid use in young athletes, and underscored the important role that dermatologists could play in the early detection and intervention in these athletes.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-4632.2009.04139.x/abstract|title=Cutaneous Manifestations of Anabolic-Androgenic Steroid Use in Athletes|work=International Journal of Dermatology|pages=1044–1048|volume=48|issue=10|year=2009|accessdate=15 December 2013|doi=10.1111/j.1365-4632.2009.04139.x}}</ref>

===1988 Seoul Olympics===
A famous case of AAS use in a competition was Canadian [[Ben Johnson (athlete)|Ben Johnson]]'s victory in the 100&nbsp;m at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]].<ref>[[1988 Summer Olympics]]</ref> He subsequently failed the drug test when [[stanozolol]] was found in his urine. He later admitted to using the steroid as well as [[Dianabol]], testosterone, [[Furazabol]], and [[human growth hormone]] amongst other things. Johnson was stripped of his gold medal as well as his world-record performance. [[Carl Lewis]] was then promoted one place to take the Olympic gold title. Lewis had also run under the current world record time and was therefore recognized as the new record holder.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Carl Lewis {{!}} biography – American athlete|url = http://www.britannica.com/biography/Carl-Lewis|accessdate = 16 July 2015}}</ref> In 2003, however, Wade Exum, the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) director of drug control administration from 1991 to 2000, gave copies of documents to ''Sports Illustrated'' which revealed that some 100 American athletes who failed drug tests and should have been prevented from competing in the Olympics were nevertheless cleared to compete; among those athletes was Carl Lewis.

Lewis broke his silence on allegations that he was the beneficiary of a drugs cover-up, admitting he had tested positive for banned substances but claiming he was just one of "hundreds" of American athletes who were allowed to escape bans, concealed by the USOC. Lewis has now acknowledged that he failed three tests during the 1988 US Olympic trials, which under international rules at the time should have prevented him from competing in the Seoul games.<ref name="guardian_2003">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/apr/24/athletics.duncanmackay|title=Lewis: 'Who cares I failed drug test?'|last=Mackay|first=Duncan|date=24 April 2003|work=The Guardian|accessdate=13 April 2009 | location=London}}</ref> Former athletes and officials came out against the USOC cover-up.

===East Germany===
{{Main article|Doping in East Germany}}
In 1977, one of East Germany's best sprinters, [[Doping in East Germany#Renate Neufeld|Renate Neufeld]], fled to the West with the Bulgarian she later married. A year later she said that she had been told to take drugs supplied by coaches while training to represent East Germany in the 1980 Olympic Games.

:At 17, I joined the East Berlin Sports Institute. My speciality was the 80m [[hurdles]]. We swore that we would never speak to anyone about our training methods, including our parents. The training was very hard. We were all watched. We signed a register each time we left for dormitory and we had to say where we were going and what time we would return. One day, my trainer, Günter Clam, advised me to take pills to improve my performance: I was running 200m in 24 seconds. My trainer told me the pills were vitamins, but I soon had cramp in my legs, my voice became gruff and sometimes I couldn't talk any more. Then I started to grow a moustache and my periods stopped. I then refused to take these pills. One morning in October 1977, the secret police took me at 7am and questioned me about my refusal to take pills prescribed by the trainer. I then decided to flee, with my fiancé.<ref name="ReferenceA">Sport Information Dienst, W Germany, December 1978</ref><ref>Costelle D, Berlioux M, ''Histoires des Jeux Olympiques'', Larousse, France, 1980</ref>

She brought with her to the West grey tablets and green powder she said had been given to her, to members of her club, and to other athletes. The West German doping analyst Manfred Donike reportedly identified them as anabolic steroids. She said she stayed quiet for a year for the sake of her family. But when her father then lost his job and her sister was expelled from her handball club, she decided to tell her story.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-Z0802-015, Ilona Slupianek.jpg|thumb|[[Ilona Slupianek]] in 1981.]]

East Germany closed itself to the sporting world in May 1965.<ref name=DeMon/> In 1977, the [[Shot put|shot-putter]] Ilona Slupianek, who weighed 93&nbsp;kg, tested positive for anabolic steroids at the European Cup meeting in [[Helsinki]] and thereafter athletes were tested before they left the country. At the same time, the Kreischa testing laboratory near [[Dresden]] passed into government control, which was reputed to make around 12,000 tests a year on East German athletes but without any being penalised.<ref name=DeMon/>

The [[International Association of Athletics Federations|International Amateur Athletics Federation]] suspended Slupianek for 12 months, a penalty that ended two days before the European championships in [[Prague]]. In the reverse of what the IAAF hoped, sending her home to East Germany meant she was free to train unchecked with anabolic steroids, if she wanted to, and then compete for another gold medal, which she won.

After that, almost nothing emerged from the East German sports schools and laboratories. A rare exception was the visit by the sports writer and former athlete, Doug Gilbert of the ''Edmonton Sun'', who said:

:Dr (Heinz) Wuschech knows more about anabolic steroids than any doctor I have ever met, and yet he cannot discuss them openly any more than Geoff Capes or Mac Wilkins can openly discuss them in the current climate of amateur sports regulation. What I did learn in East Germany was that they feel there is little danger from anabolica, as they call it, when the athletes are kept on strictly monitored programmes. Although the extremely dangerous side-effects are admitted, they are statistically no more likely to occur than side-effects from the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]]. If, that is, programmes are constantly medically monitored as to dosage.<ref>Cited Woodland, Les: Dope, the use of drugs in sport, David and Charles, UK, 1980</ref>

Other reports came from the occasional athlete who fled to the West. There were 15 between 1976 and 1979. One, the ski-jumper [[Hans-Georg Aschenbach]], said: "Long-distance skiers start having injections to their knees from the age 14 because of their intensive training."<ref name=DeMon/> He said: "For every Olympic champion, there at least 350 invalids. There are gymnasts among the girls who have to wear corsets from the age of 18 because their spine and their ligaments have become so worn... There are young people so worn out by the intensive training that they come out of it mentally blank [''lessivés'' – washed out], which is even more painful than a deformed spine."<ref>''Le Figaro'', France, 19 January 1989</ref>

After German reunification, on 26 August 1993 the records were opened and the evidence was there that the [[Stasi]], the state secret police, supervised systematic doping of East German athletes from 1971 until reunification in 1990. Doping existed in other countries, says the expert Jean-Pierre de Mondenard, both communist and capitalist, but the difference with East Germany was that it was a state policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,786574,00.html |title=Sports Doping Statistics Reach Plateau in Germany |publisher=''[[Deutsche Welle]]'' |date=26 February 2003 |accessdate=4 August 2007}}</ref> The ''[[Sports Club Dynamo|Sportvereinigung Dynamo]]'' (English:''Dynamo Sports Club'')<ref>Pain And Injury in Sport: Social And Ethical Analysis, Section III, Chapter 7, Page 111, by Sigmund Loland, Berit Skirstad, Ivan Waddington, Published by Routledge in 2006, ASIN: B000OI0HZG</ref> was especially singled out as a center for doping in the former East Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.lycos.co.uk/dopingopfer/kommentar_ordner/09_2002/dynamo_liste_web.htm |title=Dynamo Liste (in German) |publisher=doping_opfer@yahoo.com |date=September 2002 |accessdate=10 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040420072135/http://members.lycos.co.uk/dopingopfer/kommentar_ordner/09_2002/dynamo_liste_web.htm |archivedate=20 April 2004 |df=dmy }}</ref> Many former club officials and some athletes found themselves charged after the dissolution of the country.

State-endorsed doping began with the Cold War when every eastern bloc gold was an ideological victory. From 1974, Manfred Ewald, the head of the GDR's sports federation, imposed blanket doping. At the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, the country of 17&nbsp;million collected nine gold medals. Four years later the total was 20 and in 1976 it doubled again to 40.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/news/story?id=2048448|title=Jenapharm says drugs were legal|publisher=ESPN|date=28 April 2005|accessdate=11 March 2008}}</ref> Ewald was quoted as having told coaches, "They're still so young and don't have to know everything."

==Endurance sports==
The use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport has become an increasing problem across a wide range of sports.<ref name="Rosen">{{cite book|last=Rosen|first=Daniel|title=Dope: A History of Performance Enhancement in Sports from the Nineteenth Century to Today.}}</ref> It is defined as any substance or drug that, when taken, gives an athlete an unfair advantage relative to a "clean" athlete.<ref name="Rosen"/> The banning of these drugs promotes a level playing field and equality among athletes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Wayne|title=Doping in Elite Sport: The Politics of Drugs in the Olympic Mvnt: The Politics of Drugs in the Olympic Movement|year=2000|publisher=Human Kinetics}}</ref> The use of 'the suit' in swimming, which gives athletes an advantage in the way of hydrodynamics, has been banned from international competition due to the unfair advantage it delivered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/full-body-swimsuit-now-banned-professional-swimmers/story?id=9437780#.T1DSDIdbc-A|title=Full Body Swimsuit Now Banned for Professional Swimmers|accessdate=1 March 2012}}</ref> The drugs taken by athletes differ widely based on the performance needs of the sport.

[[Erythropoietin]] (EPO) is largely taken by endurance athletes who seek a higher level of red blood cells, which leads to more oxygenated blood, and a higher [[VO2 max]]. An athlete's VO2 max is highly correlated with success within endurance sports such as swimming, long-distance running, cycling, rowing, and cross-country skiing. [[Erythropoietin|EPO]] has recently become prevalent amongst endurance athletes due to its potentcy and low degree of detectability when compared to other methods of doping such as [[blood transfusion]]. While EPO is believed to have been widely used by athletes in the 1990s, there was not a way to directly test for the drug until 2002. Athletes at the Olympic Games are tested for EPO through blood and urine tests. Stringent guidelines and regulations can lessen the danger of doping that has existed within some endurance sports. As of 2012, 18 pro cyclists in the last 15 years have died from using EPO.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Doping In Professional Sports – CrimeWire|url = http://www.instantcheckmate.com/crimewire/doping-in-professional-sports/|accessdate = 15 July 2015}}</ref>

{{see also|List of doping cases in cycling|Doping at the Tour de France|Doping at the 2007 Tour de France}}

====''The Convicts of the Road''====
In 1924 the journalist [[Albert Londres]] followed the Tour de France for the French newspaper ''[[Le Petit Parisien]]''. At [[Coutances]] he heard that the previous year's winner, [[Henri Pélissier]], his brother [[Francis Pélissier|Francis]] and a third rider, Maurice Ville, had resigned from the competition after an argument with the organiser [[Henri Desgrange]]. Pélissier explained the problem—whether or not he had the right to take off a jersey—and went on to talk of drugs, reported in Londres' race diary, in which he invented the phrase ''Les Forçats de la Route'' (''The Convicts of the Road''):

:"You have no idea what the Tour de France is," Henri said. "It's a [[Calvary]]. Worse than that, because the road to the Cross has only 14 stations and ours has 15. We suffer from the start to the end. You want to know how we keep going? Here..." He pulled a [[phial]] from his bag. "That's cocaine, for our eyes. This is [[chloroform]], for our gums."

:"This," Ville said, emptying his shoulder bag "is liniment to put warmth back into our knees."

:"And pills. Do you want to see pills? Have a look, here are the pills." Each pulled out three boxes.

:"The truth is," Francis said, "that we keep going on dynamite."

Henri spoke of being as white as shrouds once the dirt of the day had been washed off, then of their bodies being drained by [[diarrhea]], before continuing:

:"At night, in our rooms, we can't sleep. We twitch and dance and jig about as though we were doing [[Sydenham's chorea|St Vitus's Dance]]..."

:"There's less flesh on our bodies than on a skeleton," Francis said.<ref>Londres, Albert: Les frères Pélissier et leur camarade Ville abandonnent, ''Le Petit Parisien'', 27 June 2014, France</ref>

Francis Pélissier said much later: "Londres was a famous reporter but he didn't know about cycling. We kidded him a bit with our cocaine and our pills. Even so, the Tour de France in 1924 was no picnic."<ref name=DeMon>{{cite book |author= Jean-Pierre de Mondenard |title=Dopage : L'imposture des performances |publisher=Chiron |location=Wilmette, Ill |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=2-7027-0639-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>Woodland, Les: ''Yellow Jersey Guide to the Tour de France'', Yellow Jersey, London, 2007</ref> The acceptance of drug-taking in the Tour de France was so complete by 1930, when the race changed to national teams that were to be paid for by the organisers, that the rule book distributed to riders by the organiser, [[Henri Desgrange]], reminded them that drugs were not among items with which they would be provided.<ref>Maso, Benji:Zweet van de Goden, Holland</ref> The use of [[Pot Belge]] by road cyclists in continental Europe exemplifies a cross-over between recreational and performance-enhancing abuse of drugs by sportsman.

====Festina affair====
{{main article|Festina affair|Doping at the 1998 Tour de France}}
In 1998, the entire [[Festina]] team were excluded from the [[Tour de France]] following the discovery of a team car containing large amounts of various performance-enhancing drugs. The team director later admitted that some of the cyclists were routinely given banned substances. Six other teams pulled out in protest including [[Netherlands|Dutch]] team [[TVM (cycling team)|TVM]] who left the tour still being questioned by the [[police]]. The Festina scandal overshadowed cyclist [[Marco Pantani]]'s tour win, but he himself later failed a test. The infamous "[[Pot Belge|pot belge]]" or "Belgian mix" has a decades-long history in pro cycling, among both riders and support staff. [[David Millar]], the 2003 World-Time Trial Champion, admitted using [[erythropoietin|EPO]], and was stripped of his title and suspended for two years. [[Roberto Heras]] was stripped of his victory in the 2005 [[Vuelta a España]] and suspended for two years after testing positive for EPO.

After beating cancer and breaking records he was accused of doping.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://bv8ja7kw5x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.atitle=ETHICAL+IMPLICATIONS+OF+LANCE+ARMSTRONG%27S+PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING+DRUG+CASE&rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Legal%2C+Ethical+and+Regulatory+Issues&rft.au=Enyonam+M+Osei-Hwere&rft.au=Greg+G+Armfield&rft.au=Emily+S+Kinsky&rft.au=R+Nicholas+Gerlich&rft.date=2014-01-01&rft.pub=Jordan+Whitney+Enterprises%2C+Inc&rft.issn=1544-0036&rft.eissn=1544-0044&rft.volume=17&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=1&rft.externalDocID=3567682381&paramdict=en-US|title = Ethical implications of Lance Armstrong's performance-enhancing drug case|last = Osei-Hwere|first = E.M.|date = 1 January 2014|journal = Journal of Legal, Ethical, Regulatory Issues|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Armfield|first2 = G.G.|last3 = Kinsky|first3 = E.S.|last4 = Drumheller|first4 = K.}}</ref>  Teammates of Lance had been caught taking EPO ([[Erythropoietin]]) which made the accusations against Armstrong stronger.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/doi/10.1111/j.1465-7287.2007.00076.x/full|title = Are athletes doped?

On 22 October 2012 [[Lance Armstrong]] was stripped of his [[Tour de France]] titles since 1998.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lance Armstrong Doping Accusation|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/lance-armstrong-stripped-of-tour-de-france-titles-has-no-place-in-cycling-international-cycling-federation-president-says/2012/10/22/8591e8be-1c8c-11e2-9cd5-b55c38388962_story.html|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=22 October 2012|date=23 October 2012}}</ref> As a response to the decisions of the USADA and UCI, Armstrong resigned from the [[Lance Armstrong Foundation]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Lance Armstrong|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=50133348n|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=22 October 2012}}</ref> On 14 January 2013, Armstrong confessed to doping in an interview with [[Oprah Winfrey]] which was aired on 17 January on the [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|Oprah Winfrey Network]].

===Other endurance sports===
In triathlon, 2004 Hawaii Ironman winner [[Nina Kraft]], was disqualified for a positive test to EPO. She remains the only Hawaii Ironman winner to be disqualified for doping offences. Sports lawyer Michelle Gallen has said that the pursuit of doping athletes has turned into a modern-day [[witch-hunt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/features/?id=2004/witchhunt1|title=www.cyclingnews.com - the world centre of cycling|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2016}}</ref>

==Non-endurance sports==
{{medref|section|date=July 2015}}
In sports where physical strength is favored, athletes have used [[anabolic steroid]]s, known for their ability to increase physical strength and muscle mass.<ref name="Michael Powers 2005, p. 330">Michael Powers, "Performance-Enhancing Drugs" in Joel Houglum, in Gary L. Harrelson, Deidre Leaver-Dunn, "Principles of Pharmacology for Athletic Trainers", SLACK Incorporated, 2005, {{ISBN|1-55642-594-5}}, p. 330</ref> The drug mimics the effect of [[testosterone]] and dihydrotestosterone in the body.<ref name="Michael Powers 2005, p. 330"/> They were developed after Eastern Bloc countries demonstrated success in weightlifting during the 1940s.<ref name="Michael Powers 2005, p. 330"/> At the time they were using testosterone, which carried with it negative effects, anabolic steroids were developed as a solution. The drug has been used across a wide range of sports from football and basketball to weightlifting and track and field. While not as life-threatening as the drugs used in endurance sports, anabolic steroids have negative side effects, including:

===Side effects in men===
*acne
*impaired liver function
*impotency
*breast formation (gynecomastia)
*increase in estrogen
*erectile dysfunction
*increased sex drive
*male pattern baldness

===Side effects in women===
Side effects in women include:<ref>{{Cite web|title = Anabolic steroid misuse – NHS Choices|url = http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/anabolic-steroid-abuse/Pages/Introduction.aspx|website = www.nhs.uk|accessdate = 17 July 2015}}</ref>
*hair loss
*male pattern baldness
*hypertrophy of the [[clitoris]]
*increased sex drive
*irregularities of the menstrual cycle
*development of masculine facial traits
*increased coarseness of the skin
*premature closure of the [[epiphysis]]

In countries where the use of these drugs is controlled, there is often a [[Illegal drug trade|black market trade]] of smuggled or counterfeit drugs. The quality of these drugs may be poor and can cause health risks. In countries where anabolic steroids are strictly regulated, some have called for a regulatory relief. Steroids are available over-the-counter in some countries such as [[Thailand]] and [[Mexico]].

==Reaction from sports organizations==
Many sports organizations have banned the use of performance-enhancing drugs and have very strict rules and penalties for people who are caught using them. The International Amateur Athletic Federation, now the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]], were the first international governing body of [[sport]] to take the situation seriously. In 1928 they banned participants from doping, but with little in the way of testing available they had to rely on the word of the [[sportsperson|athlete]] that they were clean.<ref>{{Cite web|title = IAAF: A Piece of Anti-Doping History:  IAAF Handbook 1927–1928 {{!}} iaaf.org|url = http://www.iaaf.org/news/news/a-piece-of-anti-doping-history-iaaf-handbook|website = iaaf.org|accessdate = 15 July 2015}}</ref>
It was not until 1966 that [[FIFA]] and [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] ([[cycling]]) joined the IAAF in the fight against drugs, followed by the [[International Olympic Committee]] the following year.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Tribune – Magazine section – Saturday Extra|url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20061209/saturday/main2.htm|website = www.tribuneindia.com|accessdate = 15 July 2015}}</ref> Progression in [[pharmacology]] has always outstripped the ability of sports federations to implement rigorous testing procedures but since the creation of the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] in 1999, it has become more effective to catch athletes who use drugs.<ref>{{Cite web|title = What we do|url = https://www.wada-ama.org/en/what-we-do|website = World Anti-Doping Agency|accessdate = 15 July 2015}}</ref> The first tests for athletes were at the 1966 European Championships and two years later the IOC implemented their first drug tests at both the [[1968 Summer Olympics|Summer]] and [[1968 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Steroids and Doping in Sports: A Reference Handbook: A Reference Handbook|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tAtIAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA295 |publisher = ABC-CLIO|date = 26 November 2013|isbn = 9781610693141|first = David E. Newton|last = Ph.D}}</ref> [[Anabolic steroid]]s became prevalent during the 1970s and after a method of detection was found they were added to the IOC's prohibited substances list in 1975.<ref>{{Cite web|title = What Performance Enhancing Drugs Have Been or Are Banned Olympics? - Drug Use in Sports - ProCon.org|url = http://sportsanddrugs.procon.org/view.answers.php?questionID=001238|website = sportsanddrugs.procon.org|accessdate = 15 July 2015}}</ref>

Over the years, different sporting bodies have evolved differently in the struggle against doping. Some, such as athletics and cycling, are becoming increasingly vigilant against doping. However, there has been criticism that sports such as football (soccer) and baseball are doing nothing about the issue, and letting athletes implicated in doping away unpunished.

Some commentators maintain that, as outright prevention of doping is an impossibility, all doping should be legalised. However, most disagree with this, pointing out the claimed harmful long-term effects of many doping agents. Opponents claim that with doping legal, all competitive athletes would be compelled to use drugs, and the net effect would be a level playing field but with widespread health consequences. Considering that anti-doping is largely ineffective due to both testing limitations and lack of enforcement, this is not markedly different from the situation already in existence.

Another point of view is that doping could be legalized to some extent using a drug [[whitelist]] and medical counseling, such that medical [[safety]] is ensured, with all usage published. Under such a system, it is likely that athletes would attempt to cheat by exceeding official limits to try to gain an advantage; this could be considered conjecture as drug amounts do not always correlate linearly with performance gains.

==Anti-Doping organizations and legislation==
{{Expand section|date=July 2015}}
{{Main article|World Anti-Doping Agency}}
*In February 2011, the [[United States Olympic Committee]] and the [[Ad Council]] launched an anti-steroid campaign called [http://facebook.com/playasteriskfree Play Asterisk Free] aimed at teens.  The campaign first launched in 2008 under the name "Don't Be An Asterisk!".<ref>[http://www.adcouncil.org/newsDetail.aspx?id=241 Adcouncil.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929214131/http://www.adcouncil.org/newsDetail.aspx?id=241 |date=29 September 2011 }}, ''Ad Council'', 8 August 2008</ref>
*In October 2012, the [[USADA]] released evidence to corroborate their doping claim against cyclist [[Lance Armstrong]]. According to USADA CEO Travis T. Tygart, the evidence against Armstrong includes, "...scientific data and laboratory test results that further prove the use, possession and distribution of performance enhancing drugs".<ref>[http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/10/10/162640916/doping-agency-says-11-teammates-testified-against-lance-armstrong]''NPR'', 10 October 2012</ref>
*On 1 November 1989, [[US Senator]] [[Joseph Biden]] introduced S. 1829, The Steroid Trafficking Act of 1989. The purpose of the act was simple: It would "amend the Controlled Substances Act to further restrict the use of steroids. By designating anabolic steroids as a Schedule II controlled substance, the bill would crack down on illegal steroid use". (Senate Judiciary Committee, 2002, p.&nbsp;282).<ref>{{Cite web|title = |url = https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/101/s1829|website = |accessdate = 15 July 2015}}</ref>

==Test methods==
Under established doping control protocols, the participant{{clarify|date=May 2016}} will be asked to provide a urine sample, which will be divided into two, each portion to be preserved within sealed containers bearing the same unique identifying number and designation respectively as A- and B-samples.<ref>{{cite book

"It should be stressed that anti-doping is one of the few types of controls in society in which a confirmation procedure is used in order to protect individuals, and the very rare cases in which the analysis of the B-sample did not match the results of the A-sample have shown the usefulness of such procedure."<ref>

===Re-testing of samples===
According to Article 6.5 in the World Anti-Doping Code samples may be re-tested later. Samples from high-profile events, such as the [[Olympic Games]], are now re-tested up to eight years later to take advantage of new techniques for detecting banned substances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wada-ama.org/Documents/World_Anti-Doping_Program/WADP-The-Code/WADA_Anti-Doping_CODE_2009_EN.pdf |title=Ressources |publisher= |accessdate=9 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611203342/http://www.wada-ama.org/Documents/World_Anti-Doping_Program/WADP-The-Code/WADA_Anti-Doping_CODE_2009_EN.pdf |archivedate=11 June 2014 |df= }}</ref><ref>

===Cheating the tests===
Athletes seeking to avoid testing positive use various methods. The most common methods include:
*Urine replacement, which involves replacing dirty urine with clean urine from someone who is not taking banned substances. Urine replacement can be done by catheterization or with a [[prosthetic penis]] such as [[Whizzinator|The Original Whizzinator]].
*Diuretics, used to cleanse the system before having to provide a sample.
*Blood transfusions, which increase the blood's oxygen carrying capacity, in turn increasing endurance without the presence of drugs that could trigger a positive test result.

===Validity===
Donald Berry, writing in the journal ''Nature'', has called attention to potential problems with the validity of ways in which many of the standardised tests are performed;<ref>{{cite journal |author=Berry, D.A. |title=The science of doping |journal=Nature |volume=454 |issue=7205 |pages=692–3 |date=2008-08-07 |pmid=18685682 |doi=10.1038/454692a |url=}}{{subscription required}}</ref><sup>[''subscription required'']</sup> in his article, as described in an accompanying editorial, Berry{{quote| argues that anti-doping authorities have not adequately defined and publicized how they arrived at the criteria used to determine whether or not a test result is positive [which are] ...calibrated in part by testing a small number of volunteers taking the substance in question. [Berry argues] ...that individual labs need to verify these detection limits in larger groups that include known dopers and non-dopers under blinded conditions that mimic what happens during competition.<ref name=NatureEditorial08>{{cite journal |author= Nature editors |title=A level playing field? |journal=Nature |volume=454 |issue=7205 |page=667 |date=2008-08-07 |pmid=18685647 |doi=10.1038/454667a |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v454/n7205/full/454667a.html}}</ref>}} The editorial closes, saying "Nature believes that accepting 'legal limits' of specific metabolites without such rigorous verification goes against the foundational standards of modern science, and results in an arbitrary test for which the rate of false positives and false negatives can never be known."<ref name=NatureEditorial08/>

==Defense==
G. Pascal Zachary argues in a ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' essay that legalizing performance-enhancing substances, as well as genetic enhancements once they became available, would satisfy society's need for [[übermensch]]en and reverse the decline in public interest in sports.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2004/04/steroids-for-everyone/|title=Steroids for Everyone!|publisher=WIRED|accessdate=9 June 2016}}</ref>

Sports scholar Verner Moller argues that society is hypocritical when it holds athletes to moral standards, but do not conform to those morals themselves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/latest_news/2013/?a=28410|title=http://www.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/latest_news/2013/?a=28410|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2016}}</ref> Fox Sports writer Jen Floyd Engel stated in an article, "We live in a pharmacological society. We live in a society of short cuts, of fake this and enhanced that, and somehow we keep trying to sell the line that sports has become this evil empire of cheating. The reality is athletes are merely doing what so many of us do and celebrate and watch every single day of our lives."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/melky-cabrera-lance-armstrong-barry-bonds-end-the-fake-steroid-outrage-082912|title=Engel: Enough with the fake steroid outrage|first=Jen Floyd|last=Engel|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2016}}</ref>

Sociologist Ellis Cashmore argues that what is considered doping is too arbitrary: [[Blood doping|transfusing blood cells]] is not allowed, but other methods of boosting blood cell count, such as [[hypobaric chamber]]s, are allowed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle-old/424/olympics.shtml|title=The Olympics Meets the War on Drugs|last=Cashmore|first=Ellis|date=February 24, 2006|website=StoptheDrugWar.org|publisher=The Drug Reform Coordination Network|access-date=October 26, 2016}}</ref> Other scholars have advanced similar arguments.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=Rory|title=Lowering Restrictions on Performance Enhancing Drugs in Elite Sports|journal=Inquiries Journal|date=2017|volume=9|issue=3|url=http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/1590/lowering-restrictions-on-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-elite-sports|accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref>

==Legal==
Anti-doping policies instituted by individual sporting governing bodies may conflict with local laws. A notable case includes the [[National Football League]] (NFL) inability to suspend players found with banned substances, after it was ruled by a [[United States District Court for the District of Minnesota|federal court]], that local labor laws superseded the NFL's anti-doping regime. The challenge was supported by the [[National Football League Players Association]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4543169|title=Congress to review blocked doping suspensions|date=8 October 2009|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/04/sports/football/04starcaps.html?_r=1&hpw | work=The New York Times | title=N.F.L. Seeks Congressional Help on Drug Policy | first=Ken | last=Belson | date=4 November 2009 | accessdate=27 May 2010}}</ref>

Athletes caught doping may be subject to penalties from their locality as well from the individual sporting governing body. The legal status of anabolic steroids varies from country to country. Using performance-enhancing drugs in mixed martial arts competitions like the [[UFC]] could find the guilty fighter charged or sued once Bill S-209 passes.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://topmmanews.com/2013/03/09/legal-ramifications-for-using-peds-in-canadian-mma/ | work=TopMMANews.com | title=Legal Ramifications for Using PEDs in MMA? | first=Erik| last=Magraken| date=9 March 2013 | accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref>

Under certain circumstances, when athletes need to take a prohibited substance to treat a medical condition, a therapeutic use exemption may be granted.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wada-ama.org/en/what-we-do/science-medical/therapeutic-use-exemptions | title = Therapeutic Use Exemptions | publisher = [[World Anti-Doping Agency]]}}</ref>
