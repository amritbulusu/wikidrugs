'''Chlormethine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]]), also known as '''mechlorethamine''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]], [[United States Pharmacopeia|USP]]), '''mustine''', '''HN2''', and (in [[post-Soviet states]]) '''Embichin''' (эмбихин), is a [[nitrogen mustard]] sold under the brand name '''Mustargen'''. It is the prototype of [[alkylating agent]]s, a group of [[cancer|anticancer]] chemotherapeutic drugs. It works by binding to DNA, crosslinking two strands and preventing cell duplication. It binds to the N7 nitrogen on the DNA base [[guanine]]. As the chemical is a [[blister agent]], its use is strongly restricted within the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] where it is classified as a [[List of Schedule 1 substances (CWC)|Schedule 1 substance]].

Mechlorethamine belongs to the group of [[nitrogen mustard]] [[alkylating antineoplastic agent|alkylating agents]].<ref name="pmid10746948">{{cite journal |vauthors=Rappeneau S, Baeza-Squiban A, Jeulin C, Marano F |title=Protection from cytotoxic effects induced by the nitrogen mustard mechlorethamine on human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro |journal=Toxicol.

==Uses==
It has been derivatized into the [[estrogen]] analogue [[estramustine phosphate]], used to treat [[prostate cancer]]. It can also be used in [[chemical warfare]] where it has the code-name '''HN2'''. This chemical is a form of nitrogen [[mustard gas]] and a powerful [[vesicant]]. Historically, some uses of mechlorethamine have included lymphoid malignancies such as Hodgkin’s disease, lymphosarcoma, chronic myelocytic leukemia, polycythemia vera, and bronchogenic carcinoma <ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 8085692| year = 1994| author1 = Bunn Jr| first1 = P.

Retrieved from http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682223.html</ref> but when compounded into a topical formulation it can also be used to treat skin diseases.

Another important use of chlormethine is in the synthesis of [[meperidine]].

==Side effects and toxicity==
Mechlorethamine is a highly toxic medication, especially for women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or of childbearing age.<ref>Recordati Rare Diseases Inc. (2013). Mustargen Package Insert. Retrieved from http://www.drugs.com/pro/mustargen.html</ref><ref>Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (2013) Valchlor Package Insert.  Retrieved from http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/202317lbl.pdf</ref> At high enough levels, exposure can be fatal.<ref name=":0" />

The adverse effects of mechlorethamine depend on the formulation.<ref>[http://www.drugs.com/pro/mustargen.html Mustargen] and [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/202317lbl.pdf Valchlor]</ref> When used in chemical warfare, it can cause immunosuppression and damage to mucous membranes of the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract. Mucous membranes and damp or damaged skin are more affected by exposure to HN-2. Though symptoms of exposure are generally delayed, the DNA damage it causes occurs very quickly. More serious exposures cause symptoms to develop sooner. Eye symptoms develop first, in the first 1–2 hours (severe exposure) or 3–12 hours (mild to moderate exposure) followed by airway (2-6/12–24 hours) and skin symptoms (6–48 hours). Hot, humid weather shortens the latent (symptom-free) period.<ref name=":0" />

Symptoms of toxic exposure to HN-2 vary based on the route of exposure. Eye exposure causes [[Tears|lacrimation]] (tear production), burning, irritation, itching, a feeling of grittiness or dryness, [[blepharospasm]] (spasms of the eyelid), and [[miosis]] (pinpoint pupils). More severe cases cause [[edema]] (swelling from fluid accumulation) in the eyelids, [[photophobia]] (extreme sensitivity to light), severe pain, [[corneal ulcer]]ation, and blindness.<ref name=":0" />

Inhalation of chlormethine damages the upper and lower airways sequentially, with more severe exposures causing faster damage that afflicts lower parts of the respiratory tract. Early symptoms include [[rhinorrhea]] (runny nose), [[Nosebleed|epistaxis]] (nosebleed), toneless voice, sneezing, barking cough, and [[dyspnea]] (in smokers and asthmatics). Later symptoms include pain in the nose/sinuses and inflammation of the airway. In severe cases, there may be epithelial necrosis throughout the respiratory tract, causing pseudomembrane formation, which can obstruct the airway. [[Pneumonia]] may develop and prove fatal.<ref name=":0" />

Skin exposure mainly causes [[erythema]] (redness) and [[Blister|vesication]] (blistering) at first, but absorption through the skin causes systemic toxicity. In cases where more than 25% of the skin is affected, fatal exposure is likely to have occurred.<ref name=":0" />

Though ingestion is uncommon, if mechlorethamine is swallowed it causes severe chemical burns to the gastrointestinal tract and concomitant nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hemorrhage.<ref name=":0" />

Long-term effects of acute or chronic chlormethine exposure are caused by damage to the [[immune system]]. [[White blood cell]] counts drop, increasing the risk of infection, and [[red blood cell]] and [[platelet]] counts may also drop due to [[bone marrow]] damage. Chronic eye infections may result from exposure, but blindness is temporary. Long-term effects on the respiratory system include [[anosmia]] (inability to smell), [[ageusia]] (inability to taste), inflammation, chronic infections, fibrosis, and cancer. Skin that has been damaged by HN2 can change pigmentation or become scarred, and may eventually develop cancer.<ref name=":0" />

==History==
Successful clinical use of chlormethine (mechlorethamine) resulted in development of the field of anticancer chemotherapy, led by [[Cornelius P. Rhoads]] at [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering]].  The drug is a nitrogen-based analogue of [[mustard gas]] (which is sulfur-based) and was derived from [[chemical warfare]] research.  Secret clinical trials of the agent for [[Hodgkin's disease]] and several other [[lymphoma]]s and [[leukemia]]s in humans began in December 1942.  Because of wartime secrecy restrictions, it was not until 1946 that the results of these trials were published openly.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gilman A. | title = The initial clinical trial of nitrogen mustard | journal = Am J Surg | year = 1963 | volume = 105 | pages = 574–578 | pmid = 13947966 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9610(63)90232-0 | issue = 5}}</ref>
