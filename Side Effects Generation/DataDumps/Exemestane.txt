'''Exemestane''' (trade name '''Aromasin''') is a medication used to treat [[breast cancer]]. It is a member of the class of [[antiestrogen]]s known as [[aromatase inhibitor]]s. Some breast cancers require [[estrogen]] to grow. Those cancers have estrogen [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] (ERs), and are called ER-positive. They may also be called estrogen-responsive, hormonally-responsive, or hormone-receptor-positive. [[Aromatase]] is an [[enzyme]] that synthesizes estrogen. Aromatase inhibitors block the synthesis of estrogen. This lowers the estrogen level, and slows the growth of cancers.

==Medical uses==
Exemestane is [[Indication (medicine)|indicated]] for the adjuvant treatment of [[postmenopausal]] women with estrogen-receptor positive early breast cancer who have received two to three years of [[tamoxifen]] and are switched to it for completion of a total of five consecutive years of adjuvant hormonal therapy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Coombes RC |year=2007 |title=Survival and safety of exemestane versus tamoxifen after 2–3 years' tamoxifen treatment (Intergroup Exemestane Study): a randomised controlled trial |journal=[[The Lancet|Lancet]] |volume=369 |issue=9561 |pages=559–70 |pmid=17307102 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60200-1|display-authors=etal}}</ref>
US FDA approval was in October 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/druginfo/fda-exemestane|publisher=National Cancer Institute|title=FDA Approval for Exemestane|date=5 October 2005}}</ref>

Exemestane is also indicated for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women whose disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy.<ref>[http://www.aromasin.com/content/for_advanced.aspx Aromasin For Advanced Breast Cancer] on Aromasin.com</ref>

==Contraindications==
The drug is contraindicated in [[premenopausal]] women, which of course includes pregnant and [[lactating]] women.<ref name="Austria-Codex" />

==Adverse effects==
The most common side effects (more than 10% of patients) are [[hot flash]]es and sweating, which are typical of estrogen deficiency as caused by exemestane, and also [[insomnia]], headache, and [[joint pain]]. Nausea and [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] are mainly observed in patients with advanced breast cancer.<ref name="Austria-Codex" /><ref name="Drugs.com">Drugs.com: {{drugs.com|monograph|exemestane}} on exemestane.</ref>

An occasional decrease in lymphocytes has been observed in approximately 20% of patients receiving Aromasin, particularly in patients with pre-existing lymphopenia. <ref>https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/2484</ref>

Exemestane has [[androgen]]ic properties similarly to [[formestane]] and can produce androgenic side effects such as [[acne]] and [[weight gain]], although these are generally associated with supratherapeutic dosages of the drug.<ref name="pmid12404296">{{cite journal | vauthors = Buzdar AU, Robertson JF, Eiermann W, Nabholtz JM | title = An overview of the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the newer generation aromatase inhibitors anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane | journal = Cancer | volume = 95 | issue = 9 | pages = 2006–16 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12404296 | doi = 10.1002/cncr.10908 | url = }}</ref>

==Overdose==
Single doses of up to at least 32-fold (800&nbsp;mg), as well as continuous therapy with 24-fold (600&nbsp;mg) the usual daily dose are well tolerated. No life-threatening overdosing is known in humans, but only in animal studies with 2000- to 4000-fold doses (adjusted to [[body surface area]]).<ref name="Austria-Codex" />

==Interactions==
Exemestane is metabolized by the liver enzyme [[CYP3A4]]. While the CYP3A4 inhibitor [[ketoconazole]] had no significant effect on exemestane levels in a clinical trial, the strong CYP3A4 inductor [[rifampicin]] significantly cut exemenstane levels about in half ([[Area under the curve (pharmacokinetics)|AUC]] −54%, [[Cmax (pharmacology)|C<sub>max</sub>]] −41% for a single dose), potentially compromising its effectiveness. Other 3A4 inductors such as [[carbamazepine]] and [[St John's Wort]] are expected to have similar effects.<ref name="Austria-Codex" /><ref name="Drugs.com" /> The clinical relevance of this effect has not been investigated.<ref name="Dinnendahl" />

Estrogens probably reduce exemestane effectiveness:<ref name="Drugs.com" /> It would usually be counter-productive to reduce the body's estrogen synthesis with exemestane and then substitute estrogen with pharmaceuticals.

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
Exemestane is an oral steroidal aromatase inhibitor that is used in ER-positive breast cancer in addition to surgery and/or radiation in post-menopausal women.

The main source of [[estrogen]] is the ovaries in premenopausal women, while in post-menopausal women most of the body's estrogen is produced via the conversion of [[androgen]]s into estrogen by the aromatase enzyme in the peripheral tissues (i.e. adipose tissue like that of the breast) and a number of sites in the brain. Estrogen is produced locally via the actions of the aromatase enzyme in these peripheral tissues where it acts locally.  Any circulating estrogen in post-menopausal women as well as men is the result of estrogen escaping local metabolism and entering the circulatory system.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Simpson ER |title=Sources of estrogen and their importance |journal=The Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology |volume=86 |issue=3–5 |pages=225–30 |year=2003 |pmid=14623515 |doi=10.1016/S0960-0760(03)00360-1}}</ref>

Exemestane is an irreversible, steroidal aromatase inactivator of type I, structurally related to the natural substrate [[4-androstenedione]]. It acts as a false substrate for the aromatase enzyme, and is processed to an intermediate that binds irreversibly to the active site of the enzyme causing its inactivation, an effect also known as "[[suicide inhibition]]." By being structurally similar to enzyme targets, exemestane permanently binds to the enzymes, preventing them from converting androgen into estrogen.<ref name="Austria-Codex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Jasek, W|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2007|edition=62nd|isbn=978-3-85200-181-4|pages=656–660|language=German}}</ref>

Type II aromatase inhibitors such as [[anastrozole]] and [[letrozole]], by contrast, are not steroids and work by interfering with the aromatase's [[heme]].<ref name="Dinnendahl">{{cite book|title=Arzneistoff-Profile|editor=Dinnendahl, V |editor2 = Fricke, U|publisher=Govi Pharmazeutischer Verlag|location=Eschborn, Germany|date=2007|edition=21|volume=4|isbn=978-3-7741-9846-3|language=German}}</ref>

The estrogen suppression rate for exemestane varies from 35% for [[estradiol]] (E2) to 70% for [[estrone]] (E1).<ref>

===Pharmacokinetics===
Exemestane is quickly absorbed from the gut, but undergoes a strong [[first-pass effect]] in the liver. Highest blood plasma concentrations are reached after 1.2 hours in breast cancer patients and after 2.9 hours in healthy subjects. Maximal aromatase inhibition occurs after two to three days.<ref name="Dinnendahl" /> 90% of the absorbed substance are bound to [[plasma protein]]s. The liver enzyme CYP3A4 [[Redox|oxidizes]] the [[methylene group|methylidene]] group in position 6, and the 17-[[ketone|keto]] group (on the five-membered ring) is reduced by [[aldo-keto reductase]]s to an [[alcohol]]. Of the resulting metabolites, 40% are excreted via the urine and 40% via the feces within a week. The original substance accounts for only 1% of excretion in the urine. The terminal half-life is 24 hours.<ref name="Austria-Codex" /><ref name="Mutschler">{{Cite book|last1=Mutschler|first1=Ernst|last2=Schäfer-Korting|first2=Monika|title=Arzneimittelwirkungen|language=German|location=Stuttgart|publisher=Wissenschaftliche Verlagsgesellschaft|year=2001|edition=8|page=904|isbn=3-8047-1763-2}}</ref>

==Chemistry==
[[File:Androstendion.svg|thumb|[[4-Androstenedione]] for comparison]]
Exemestane is known chemically as '''6-methylideneandrosta-1,4-diene-3,17-dione'''. Like the aromatase inhibitors [[formestane]] and [[atamestane]], exemestane is a [[steroid]] that is structurally similar to 4-androstenedione, the natural substrate of aromatase. It is distinguished from the natural substance only by the methylidene group in position 6 and an additional double bond in position 1.<ref name="Steinhilber">{{cite book|title=Medizinische Chemie|last1=Steinhilber|first1=D|last2=Schubert-Zsilavecz|first2=M|last3=Roth|first3=HJ|publisher=Deutscher Apotheker Verlag|location=Stuttgart|year=2005|isbn=3-7692-3483-9|pages=467f|language=German}}</ref>

Pure exemestane is a white to off-white powder that is soluble in [[Dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]] to at least 20&nbsp;mg/mL. [[Optical rotation]] [α]<sub>''D''</sub> is +250 to 300° (per g/100&nbsp;cm³ and decimetre at 589&nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]] wavelength).<ref name="Sigma">{{Sigma-Aldrich|Sigma|id=PZ0006|name=Exemestane, ≥ 98% (HPLC)|accessdate=12 December 2015}}</ref>

==Society and culture==

===Recreational use in men===
Exemestane has been used in [[Doping in sport|doping]] to raise [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) and [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) levels, which in turn increases the ratio of male over female sexual hormones and so improves performance. The drug also counteracts [[gynecomastia]] as well as fat and [[water retention (medicine)|water retention]] following excessive aromatase production due to [[testosterone]] doping.<ref>{{cite book|title=Das Schwarze Buch – Anabole Steroide|year=2007|page=133|isbn=978-3-00-020944-4|language=de}}</ref>

Along with other aromatase inhibitors, exemestane is on the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]]'s list of prohibited substances.<ref>[http://www.karatecanada.org/docs/medical/CCES-PUB-SubstanceClassification-E.pdf Substance Classification Booklet], Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport, Version 4.0, January 2009.</ref>

==Research==
Oral exemestane 25&nbsp;mg/day for 2–3 years of adjuvant therapy was generally more effective than 5 years of continuous adjuvant [[tamoxifen]] in the treatment of postmenopausal women with early-stage estrogen receptor-positive/unknown receptor status breast in a large well-designed{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} trial. Preliminary data from the open-label TEAM trial comparing exemestane with tamoxifen indicated in 2009 that exemestane 25&nbsp;mg/day is also effective in the primary adjuvant treatment of early-stage breast cancer in postmenopausal women.<ref name="exem">{{cite journal |vauthors=Deeks ED, Scott LJ |url=http://adisonline.com/drugs/Abstract/2009/69070/Exemestane__A_Review_of_its_Use_in_Postmenopausal.7.aspx |title=Exemestane: A Review of its Use in Postmenopausal Women with Breast Cancer |doi=10.2165/00003495-200969070-00007 |journal=Drugs |volume=69 |issue=7 |pages=889–918 |year=2009 }}</ref>

Interim phase III trial results in 2011 showed that adding [[everolimus]] to exemestane therapy against advanced breast cancer can significantly improve [[progression-free survival]] compared with exemestane therapy alone.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/positive-trial-data-leads-novartis-to-plan-breast-cancer-filing-for-afinitor-by-year-end/81245384/ |title=Positive Trial Data Leads Novartis to Plan Breast Cancer Filing for Afinitor by Year End |year=2011 }}</ref>

A Phase III trial was reported in 2011, concluding that the use of exemestane in postmenopausal women at an increased risk for breast cancer reduced the incidence of invasive breast cancer.  In 4,560 women, after 35 months, the administration of exemestane at a dose of 25&nbsp;mg/day resulted in a 65% reduction in the risk of breast cancer compared with placebo; annual incidence rates were 0.19% and 0.55%, respectively (hazard ratio: 0.35; 95% CI [0.18-0.70]; p = 0.002).<ref>{{cite web | last=Goss | first=Paul E.|title=Exemestane Offers New Option for Breast Cancer Prevention|url=http://chicago2011.asco.org/ASCODailyNews/HER2.aspx|date= June 6, 2011|accessdate= June 6, 2011|publisher=American Society of Clinical Oncology}}</ref>
