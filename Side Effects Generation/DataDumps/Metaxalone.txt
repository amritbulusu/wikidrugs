'''Metaxalone''' (marketed by [[King Pharmaceuticals]] under the brand name '''Skelaxin''') is a [[muscle relaxant]] used to relax muscles and relieve pain caused by strains, [[sprain]]s, and other musculoskeletal conditions.  Its exact mechanism of action is not known, but it may be due to general [[central nervous system]] [[depressant|depression]].  It is considered to be a moderately strong muscle relaxant, with relatively low incidence of side effects.  Skelaxin is available in an 800&nbsp;mg scored tablet.  Possible side effects include nausea, vomiting, drowsiness and [[Central nervous system|CNS]] side effects, such as dizziness, headache, and irritability.

The metabolism of metaxalone involves the liver cytochrome P450 system.  Based on the information in the labeling, patients receiving metaxalone therapy and physicians prescribing metaxalone are directed to take precaution when coadministering it with other medications involving the P450 system.<ref>[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=7,122,566.PN.&OS=PN/7,122,566&RS=PN/7,122,566 United States Patent No. 7,122,566, by Jie Du, et al]</ref><ref>[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=7,378,434.PN.&OS=PN/7,378,434&RS=PN/7,378,434 United States Patent No. 7,378,434, by Jie Du, et al]</ref>

Because of potential for side effects, this drug is considered high risk in the elderly. {{As of|2015}} the cost for a typical month of medication in the United States is 100 to 200 USD.<ref name=Ric2015>{{cite book|last1=Hamilton|first1=Richart|title=Tarascon Pocket Pharmacopoeia 2015 Deluxe Lab-Coat Edition|date=2015|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning|isbn=9781284057560|page=2}}</ref>

Nirogi ''et al.''<ref name="pmid16803662" /> reported a liquid chromatographic method coupled to tandem mass spectrometry for the quantification of metaxalone in human plasma. A stability-indicating HPLC method was introduced by P.K. Sahu ''et al.''<ref>Prafulla Kumar Sahu, M.
