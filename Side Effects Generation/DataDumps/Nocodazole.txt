'''Nocodazole''' is an [[antineoplastic agent]] which exerts its effect in cells by interfering with the [[polymer]]ization of [[microtubule]]s. Microtubules are one type of fibre which constitutes the [[cytoskeleton]], and the dynamic microtubule network has several important roles in the cell, including vesicular transport, forming the [[mitotic spindle]] and in [[cytokinesis]]. Several drugs including [[vincristine]] and [[colcemid]] are similar to nocodazole in that they interfere with microtubule polymerization.

Interestingly, nocodazole has been shown to decrease the oncogenic potential of cancer cells via another microtubules-independent mechanisms. Nocodazole stimulates the expression of LATS2 which potently inhibits the [[Wnt signaling pathway]] by abrogating the interaction between the Wnt-dependent transcriptional co-factors [[beta-catenin]] and [[BCL9]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title = LATS2 suppresses oncogenic Wnt signaling by disrupting β-catenin/BCL9 interaction|journal = Cell Reports|date = 2013-12-26|issn = 2211-1247|pmc = 3897473|pmid = 24360964|pages = 1650–1663|volume = 5|issue = 6|doi = 10.1016/j.celrep.2013.11.037|first = Jiong|last = Li|first2 = Xiaohong|last2 = Chen|first3 = Xiangming|last3 = Ding|first4 = Yingduan|last4 = Cheng|first5 = Bin|last5 = Zhao|first6 = Zhi-Chun|last6 = Lai|first7 = Khalid|last7 = Al Hezaimi|first8 = Razqallah|last8 = Hakem|first9 = Kun-Liang|last9 = Guan}}</ref>

It is related to [[mebendazole]] by replacement of the left most benzene ring by [[thiophene]].

==Use in cell biology research==
As nocodazole affects the cytoskeleton, it is often used in [[cell biology]] experiments as a control: for example, some dominant negative [[Rho]] [[small GTPase]]s cause a similar effect as nocodazole, and constitutively activated mutants often reverse or negate the effect.

Nocodazole is frequently used in cell biology laboratories to synchronize the [[cell cycle|cell division cycle]]. Cells treated with nocodazole arrest with a [[G2 phase|G2]]- or [[Mitosis|M]]-phase DNA content when analyzed by [[flow cytometry]]. Microscopy of nocodazole-treated cells shows that they do enter [[mitosis]] but cannot form [[metaphase]] [[mitotic spindle|spindles]] because microtubules (of which the spindles are made) cannot polymerise. The absence of microtubule attachment to [[kinetochore]]s activates the [[spindle checkpoint|spindle assembly checkpoint]], causing the cell to arrest in [[prometaphase]]. For cell synchronization experiments, nocodazole is usually used at a concentration of 40–100&nbsp;ng/mL of culture medium for a duration of 12–18 hours. Prolonged arrest of cells in mitosis due to nocodazole treatment typically results in cell death by [[apoptosis]].

Another standard cell biological application of nocodazole is to induce the formation of Golgi ministacks in [[eukaryotic]] cells. The perinuclear structural organization of the [[Golgi apparatus]] in eukaryotes is dependent on microtubule trafficking, but disrupting the trafficking of Golgi elements from the endoplasmic reticulum treatment with nocodazole (33 ''μ''M for 3 hours) induces numerous Golgi elements to form adjacent to ER exit sites. These functional Golgi ministacks remain distributed about the cell, unable to track forward to form a perinuclear Golgi since nocodazole has depolymerized the microtubules.

Also used with Mad2p protein as an anti-microtubule drug.
