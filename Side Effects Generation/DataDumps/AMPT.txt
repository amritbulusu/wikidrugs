AMPT is successful at inhibiting catecholamine production in humans whether the rate of synthesis is high, as in pheochromocytoma, or normal as in patients with hypertension.<ref name="engelman 1968" />

===Effect on blood pressure===

Pheochromocytoma patients exhibited a drop in blood pressure when taking AMPT.<ref name=engelman /> AMPT had no effect in patients with hypertension (high blood pressure).<ref name=engelman />

==Pharmacokinetics==
'''''Absorption''''' 
AMPT is minimally metabolized by the body and absorbed well after oral ingestion making its bioavailability high.<ref name=brogden /> Single-dose studies have shown that a 1,000&nbsp;mg dose results in AMPT levels in the plasma of 12-14&nbsp;µg/mL after 1 to 3 hours of ingestion.<ref name=engelman /> Maintenance-dose studies have shown that absorption of AMPT is overall the same in all individuals taking doses in the range of 300-4,000&nbsp;mg per day.<ref name=engelman />

'''''Half-life'''''

The half-life of AMPT in normal patients is 3.4 to 3.7 hours.<ref name=brogden /> In amphetamine addicts the half-life is 7.2 hours.<ref name=brogden />

'''''Elimination'''''

Small amounts of metabolites (alpha-methyldopa and alpha-methyldopamine) were found after the administration of both single-doses and maintenance-doses of AMPT.<ref name="engelman 1968" />  Small amounts of methyltyramine and alpha-methylnoradrenaline were found in patients undergoing AMPT therapy.<ref name="engelman 1968" />  Urine analysis also recovered 45 to 88 percent of unchanged AMPT after drug ingestion.<ref name=brogden /> Of the total AMPT excreted, 50 to 60 percent appeared in urine within the first 8 hours and 80 to 90 percent appeared within 24 hours of oral administration.<ref name=brogden />

==Medical Use==
'''''Pheochromocytoma'''''

Pheochromocytoma is a rare neuroendocrine tumor that results in the release of too much epinephrine and norepinephrine, hormones that control heart rate, metabolism, and blood pressure.<ref name="pedia">[Encyclopedia, A.D.A.M.

'''''Drug Interactions'''''

''Psychosis''-
Phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase at Ser31 or Ser40 can increase dopamine biosynthesis; therefore an increase in pSer31 or pSer40 elevates dopamine synthesis in DA neurons.<ref name=ankenman />  Excessive dopamine in the mesolimbic pathways of the brain produces psychotic symptoms.<ref name=nestler /> Antipsychotic medications block dopamine D2 receptors in the caudate and putamen as well as in limbic target areas, they can also block or partially block serotonin.<ref name=nestler />  Therapy with AMPT could prove to be more specific to dopamine and therefore eliminate some of the negative side effects of antipsychotic drugs.

''Cocaine and Methamphetamines''-
The dopamine transporter (DAT) is a principal site of action for cocaine. Cocaine inhibits DAT function and vesicular dopamine transport (VMAT).<ref name="brown">{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Jeffrey M.|last2=Hanson|first2=Glen R.|last3=Fleckenstein|first3=Annette E.|date=2001|title=Regulation of the Vesicular Monoamine Transporter-2: A Novel Mechanism for Cocaine and Other Psychostimulants|url=http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/296/3/762|journal=Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics|language=en|volume=296|issue=3|pages=762–767|issn=0022-3565|pmid=11181904}}</ref> Cocaine administration abruptly and reversibly increases both the Vmax of dopamine uptake and the Bmax of vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT-2) ligand (dihydrotetrabenazine) binding.<ref name=brown />  Dopamine depletion resulting from administration of AMPT had similar neuropharmacological effects as cocaine.<ref name=brown />  Administration of methamphetamine, a dopamine-releasing agent, rapidly decreased vesicular uptake.<ref name=brown />  A relationship between cytoplasmic dopamine concentration and VMAT activity was established using cocaine, methamphetamines, and AMPT. Although it is not well understood, this relationship allows for AMPT’s inhibitory property, which blocks tyrosine hydroxylase, to increase dopamine transport by the vesicle monoamine transporter-2.<ref name=brown /> This leads to a reduction in the newly synthesized pool of dopamine from replenished tyrosine.<ref name="thomas">{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=David M.|last2=Francescutti-Verbeem|first2=Dina M.|last3=Kuhn|first3=Donald M.|date=2016|title=The newly synthesized pool of dopamine determines the severity of methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity|journal=Journal of Neurochemistry|volume=105|issue=3|pages=605–616|doi=10.1111/j.1471-4159.2007.05155.x|issn=0022-3042|pmc=2668123|pmid=18088364}}</ref> AMPT’s effect on dopamine concentration and transport is reversible and short-lived. If methamphetamine is administered while cytoplasmic dopamine is depleted to about 50% of the control levels, its neurotoxic effects are averted (Thomas et al., 2008).  The recovery of dopamine to normal levels after AMPT administration takes about 2 to 7 days, and this repletion of dopamine is not changed by methamphetamine.<ref name=thomas />  For these reasons AMPT seems to be a better treatment drug in methamphetamine addicts than reserpine, which is also being researched as a possible methamphetamine treatment drug. Reserpine causes almost full loss of dopamine from the striatum by disrupting vesicle storage. The repletion of dopamine after reserpine administration is slower than AMPT.<ref name=thomas />  Additionally, administration of reserpine when dopamine is maximally depleted causes neurotoxic effects, which does not occur with AMPT treatment.<ref name=thomas /> AMPT’s role in addiction has also been studied via changes in dopamine binding to D2 and D3 receptors in the striatum (caudate, putamen, and ventral striatum) after the administration of AMPT.<ref name="martinez">{{Cite journal|last=Martinez|first=Diana|last2=Greene|first2=Kaitlin|last3=Broft|first3=Allegra|last4=Kumar|first4=Dileep|last5=Liu|first5=Fei|last6=Narendran|first6=Rajesh|last7=Slifstein|first7=Mark|last8=Van Heertum|first8=Ronald|last9=Kleber|first9=Herbert D.|date=2016|title=Lower Level of Endogenous Dopamine in Patients With Cocaine Dependence: Findings From PET Imaging of D2/D3 Receptors Following Acute Dopamine Depletion|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=166|issue=10|pages=1170–1177|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2009.08121801|issn=0002-953X|pmc=2875882|pmid=19723785}}</ref> Findings revealed that cocaine-dependent subjects exhibited lower levels of endogenous dopamine relative to healthy subjects after AMPT administration. Similar positive effects were found in the role of AMPT in methamphetamine-addicted subjects.

''Dystonia and Dyskinesia''-
Dystonias and dyskinesias onset seems to derive from inconsistent regulation of dopamine in dopamine pathways.<ref name=ankenman /> AMPT’s ability to deplete dopamine in the CNS makes it a promising target for treatment of dopamine related disorders.

==Side-effects==
AMPT administration in healthy subjects has shown to cause increased sleepiness, decreased calmness, increased tension and anger, and a trend for increased depression.<ref name=brogden /> Sedation was also reported as a side effect of AMPT ingestion. However, sedation was not seen in AMPT doses of less than 2g per day.<ref name=engelman /> Patients have reported insomnia as a withdrawal symptom post AMPT exposure.<ref name="engelman 1968" />  When L-dopa is administered following AMPT administration, the effects of AMPT are reversed.<ref name="mccann">{{Cite journal|last=McCann|first=Una D.|last2=Thorne|first2=David|last3=Hall|first3=Martica|last4=Popp|first4=Kathy|last5=Avery|first5=Warren|last6=Sing|first6=Helen|last7=Thomas|first7=Maria|last8=Belenky|first8=Gregory|date=1995|title=The Effects of L-Dihydroxyphenylalanine on Alertness and Mood in α-Methyl-Para-Tyrosine-Treated Healthy Humans|url=http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v13/n1/pdf/1380274a.pdf|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=41–52|doi=10.1016/0893-133X(94)00134-L|issn=0893-133X|pmid=8526970}}</ref> These findings suggest that AMPT's effect on alertness and anxiety is catecholamine-specific and further supports that catecholamines are involved in the regulation of normal states of arousal and pathological anxiety symptoms.<ref name="mccann" />  Patients have reported hand, leg, and trunk tremors as well as tightening of the jaw post AMPT drug therapy.

==Mechanism==
As a [[competitive inhibitor]] of [[tyrosine hydroxylase]],  it prevents the conversion of [[tyrosine]] to [[L-DOPA]], the precursor to [[dopamine]]. This results in lowered systematic [[catecholamine]] ([[dopamine]], [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]]) levels.
