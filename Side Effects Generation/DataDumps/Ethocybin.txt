'''Ethocybin''' ('''CEY-19'''; 4-phosphoryloxy-DET; 4-PO-DET) is a [[Homology (chemistry)|homologue]] of the mushroom [[alkaloid]] [[psilocybin]], and a [[semi-synthetic]] [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] [[alkaloid]] of the [[tryptamine]] family. Effects of ethocybin are comparable to those of a shorter [[LSD]] or [[psilocybin]], although intensity and duration vary depending on dosage, individual physiology, and [[set and setting]].{{Fact|date=March 2009}}

== Chemistry ==
As with psilocybin, miprocybin and metocybin, ethocybin is a [[prodrug]] that is converted into the [[Pharmacology|pharmacologically]] active compound [[4-HO-DET|ethocin]] in the body by [[dephosphorylation]].{{Fact|date=March 2009}} This [[chemical reaction]] takes place under strongly [[acidic]] conditions or [[Enzyme|enzymatically]] by [[phosphatase]]s in the body.

[[Albert Hofmann]] was the first to produce this chemical, soon after his discovery of [[psilocin]] and [[psilocybin]].<ref>{{US patent reference | number = 3075992  | y = 1963 | m = 1 | d = 29 | inventor = Hofmann, Albert; Troxler, Franz.  | title = Esters of indoles }}</ref> It was sold under the code name CEY-39.

== Pharmacology ==

As with psilocybin, ethocybin is rapidly dephosphorylated in the body to [[4-HO-DET]]  which then acts as a [[partial agonist]] at the [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]] [[serotonin receptor]] in the brain where it mimics the effects of [[serotonin]] (5-HT).{{Fact|date=March 2009}}

== Medicine ==

Ethocybin has been studied as a treatment for several disorders since the early 1960s, and numerous papers are devoted to this material.{{Fact|date=March 2009}}  Its short-lived action was considered a virtue. A 2010 Study showed that Ethocybin helped with [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar personality disorder]].

== Effects ==

Ethocybin is absorbed through the lining of the mouth and stomach. Effects begin 20-45 minutes after ingestion, and last from 2-4 hours depending on dose, species, and individual metabolism.{{Fact|date=March 2009}}  The effects are somewhat shorter compared to psilocybin.

== Pharmacology ==

Ethocybin is probably metabolized mostly in the [[liver]] where it becomes ethocin, but is also broken down by the enzyme [[monoamine oxidase]].{{Fact|date=March 2009}}

Mental and physical tolerance to psilocybin builds and dissipates quickly. Taking ethocybin more than three or four times in a week (especially two days in a row) can result in diminished effects. Tolerance dissipates after a few days, so frequent users often keep doses spaced five to seven days apart to avoid the effect.

== Legality ==

Ethocybin is not controlled in the USA, but possession or sale may be considered illegal under the [[Federal Analog Act]].
