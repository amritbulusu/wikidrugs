Thiotepa is an [[organophosphorus compound]] with the formula SP(NC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Maanen, M. J.; Smeets, C. J.; [[Jos Beijnen|Beijnen, J.

It is manufactured by heating [[aziridine]] with [[thiophosphoryl chloride]].

==History==
Thiotepa was developed by the [[American Cyanamid]] company in the early 1950s and reported to media outlets in 1953.<ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Sykes, M. P. |author2=Karnofsky, D. A. |author3=Philips, F. S. |author4=Burchenal, J.

On January 29, 2007, the [[European Medicines Agency]] designated thiotepa as an [[orphan drug]]. On April 2, 2007, the [[United States]] FDA designated thiotepa as a conditioning treatment for use prior to [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dddmag.com/news-EMA-Grants-Adienne-Marketing-Rights-for-Tepadina-31910.aspx | title = EMA Grants Adienne Marketing Rights for Tepadina | date = 19 March 2010 | work = dddmag.com | publisher = Drug Discovery & Development | accessdate = 25 November 2011}}</ref> Adienne Pharma & Biotech ([[Italy]]), the owner of thiotepa (Tepadina) applied for these designations.

==Use==
Thiotepa is indicated for use in combination with other [[chemotherapy|chemotherapeutic]] agents. This can be with or without [[total body irradiation]] (TBI), as a conditioning treatment prior to allogeneic or autologous [[hematopoietic]] progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) in [[haematological disease|hematological disease]]s in adult and pediatric patients. These diseases include Hodgkin's disease and leukaemia. Thiotepa is also used with high-dose chemotherapy with HPCT support to treat certain solid tumors in adult and pediatric patients.<ref name="FDA">{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DrugSafety/DrugShortages/UCM251666.pdf | title = Urgent, thioTEPA update | date = 5 April 2011 | work = [[Food and Drug Administration]] | publisher = Adienne Pharma & Biotech | accessdate = 25 November 2011 }}</ref>

Thiotepa is used in the [[Palliative care|palliation]] of many [[Neoplasm|neoplastic disease]]s. The best results are found in the treatment of [[adenocarcinoma]] of the [[breast]], adenocarcinoma of the [[ovary]], [[papillary thyroid cancer]] and [[bladder cancer]]. Thiotepa is used to control intracavitary effusions caused by [[Serous membrane|serosal]] neoplastic deposits.<ref name="FDA" />

===Intravesical use===
Thiotepa is used as intravesical [[chemotherapy]] in bladder cancer.<ref>Droller M. [https://books.google.com/books?id=q19Iox_cJNUC&pg=PA207&dq=thiotepa&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjzvdnjlerVAhWCbbwKHdYHCaEQ6AEIMTAC#v=onepage&q=thiotepa&f=false ''Urothelial Tumors''] PMPH-USA, 2004. p. 207 {{ISBN|1550091735}}</ref>

It may be used prophylactically to prevent seeding of tumor cells at cystoscopic biopsy; as an adjunctive agent at the time of biopsy; or as a therapeutic agent to prevent recurrence after cystoscopic resection of bladder tumor ([[transurethral resection of bladder tumor]], TURBT). For intravesical use, thiotepa is given in 30&nbsp;mg doses weekly, for four to six weeks. Efficacy in tumor control may reach 55 percent. The main toxicity of this therapy is [[bone marrow suppression]] due to systemic absorption of the drug.

==Side effects==
The main side effect of thiotepa is [[bone marrow suppression]] resulting in [[leukopenia]], [[thrombocytopenia]] and [[anemia]].<ref>{{cite journal | author1 = Agnelli, G. |author2=de Cunto, M. |author3=Gresele, P. |author4=del Favero, A. | title = Early onset life-threatening myelosuppression after low dose of intravesical thiotepa | journal = Postgraduate Medical Journal | year = 1982 | volume = 58 | issue = 680 | pages = 380–381 | pmid = 6812036 | pmc = 2426344 | doi = 10.1136/pgmj.58.680.380 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2426344/pdf/postmedj00210-0063.pdf | format = pdf }}</ref> Liver and lung toxicity may also occur.
