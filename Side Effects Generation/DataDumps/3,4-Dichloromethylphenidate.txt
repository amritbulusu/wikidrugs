'''3,4-Dichloromethylphenidate''' is a [[stimulant]] drug related to [[methylphenidate]].  Dichloromethylphenidate is a potent psychostimulant that acts as both a [[dopamine]] reuptake inhibitor and [[norepinephrine]] reuptake inhibitor, meaning it effectively boosts the levels of the norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmitters in the brain, by binding to, and partially blocking the transporter proteins that normally remove those monoamines from the synaptic cleft

'''3,4-CTMP''', the ''threo''-diastereomer, is approximately seven times more potent than methylphenidate in animal studies, but has weaker reinforcing effects due to its slower onset of action.<ref>{{Cite journal

==Legality==

As of October 2015 3,4-CTMP is a controlled substance in China.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sfda.gov.cn/WS01/CL0056/130753.html | title=关于印发《非药用类麻醉药品和精神药品列管办法》的通知 | publisher=China Food and Drug Administration | date=27 September 2015 | language=Chinese | accessdate=1 October 2015}}</ref>

3,4-CTMP was banned in the UK as a [[Temporary Class Drug]] from April 2015 following its unapproved sale as a [[designer drug]].<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/420983/TCDO_methylphenidate_NPS.pdf Methylphenidate-based NPS: A review of the evidence of use and harm.

Sweden's public health agency suggested to classify 3,4-CTMP as hazardous substance on November 10, 2014.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/nyheter-och-press/nyhetsarkiv/2014/november/cannabinoider-foreslas-bli-klassade-som-halsofarlig-vara/ | title=Cannabinoider föreslås bli klassade som hälsofarlig vara  | accessdate=29 June 2015}}</ref>
