'''Bepotastine''' ('''Talion''', '''Bepreve''') is a 2nd generation [[antihistamine]].<ref>{{cite journal |title = Effects of bepotastine, cetirizine, fexofenadine, and olopatadine on histamine-induced wheal-and flare-response, sedation, and psychomotor performance |author1=H.

It is currently marketed in the United States under the brand-name Bepreve, by [[ISTA Pharmaceuticals]].

== Pharmacology ==
Bepotastine is available as an [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmic]] solution and oral tablet. It is a direct [[h1 antagonist|H<sub>1</sub>-receptor antagonist]] that inhibits the release of [[histamine]] from [[mast cell]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |title = Bepotastine Monograph |journal = LexiComp |url = http://online.lexi.com/lco/action/doc/retrieve/docid/patch_f/1844380#f_pharmacology-and-pharmacokinetics}}</ref> The ophthalmic formulation has shown minimal systemic absorption, between 1 and 1.5% in healthy adults.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url = http://www.bausch.com/Portals/109/-/m/BL/United%20States/Files/Downloads/ECP/Pharma/BEPREVE-Prescribing-Info.pdf|title = Bepreve prescribing Information|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}</ref> Common side effects are eye irritation, headache, unpleasant taste, and nasopharyngitis.<ref name=":0" /> The main route of elimination is urinary excretion, 75-90% excreted unchanged.<ref name=":0" />

== Marketing history  ==
It is marketed in Japan by [[Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma|Tanabe Seiyaku]] under the brand name Talion. Talion was co-developed by Tanabe Seiyaku and [[Ube Industries]], the latter of which discovered bepotastine. In 2001, Tanabe Seiyaku granted Senju, now owned by [[Allergan]], exclusive worldwide rights, with the exception of certain Asian countries, to develop, manufacture and market bepotastine for ophthalmic use. Senju, in turn, has granted the [[United States]] rights for the ophthalmic preparation to ISTA Pharmaceuticals.

== Sales and patents  ==
In 2011, ISTA pharmaceuticals experienced a 2.4% increase in net revenues from 2010, which was driven by the sales of Bepreve.

== Clinical trials ==
A Phase III clinical trial was carried out in 2010 to evaluate the effectiveness of bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solutions 1.0% and 1.5%.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Multicenter Clinical Evaluation of Bepotastine Besilate Ophthalmic Solutions 1.0% and 1.5% to Treat Allergic Conjunctivitis|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002939410001133|journal = American Journal of Ophthalmology|date = 2010-07-01|pages = 122–127.e5|volume = 150|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.ajo.2010.02.007|first = Thomas T.|last = Macejko|first2 = Mark T.|last2 = Bergmann|first3 = Jon I.|last3 = Williams|first4 = James A.|last4 = Gow|first5 = Paul J.|last5 = Gomes|first6 = Timothy R.|last6 = McNamara|first7 = Mark B.|last7 = Abelson}}</ref> These solutions were compared to a placebo and evaluated for their ability to reduce ocular itchiness. The study was carried out with 130 individuals and evaluated after 15 minutes, 8 hours, or 16 hours. There was a reduction in itchiness at all-time points for both ophthalmic solutions. The study concluded that bepotastine besilate ophthalmic formulations reduced ocular itchiness for at least 8 hours after dosing compared to placebo. Phase I and II trials were carried out in Japan.

Studies have been performed in animals and bepotastine besilate was not found to be teratogenic in rats during fetal development, even at 3,300 times more that typical use in humans.<ref name=":0" />  Evidence of infertility was seen in rats at 3,3000 times the typical ocular does in humans.<ref name=":0" /> The safety and efficacy has not been established in patients under 2 years of age  and has been extrapolated from adults for patients under 10 years of age.<ref name=":0" />
