'''Parke-Davis''' is a [[subsidiary]] of the [[pharmaceutical company]] [[Pfizer]]. Although no longer an independent corporation, it was once America's oldest and largest drug maker,<ref>[http://www.pfizer.com/pfizer/history/2000.jsp Exploring Our History: 2000 - Pfizer acquires Warner-Lambert]. from Pfizer corporate website. Accessed May 19, 2006.</ref> and played an important role in medical history. 

Parke-Davis was acquired by [[Warner–Lambert]] in 1970, which in turn was bought by [[Pfizer Inc.|Pfizer]] in 2000.

Parke-Davis and Company was founded in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] by Dr. Samuel P. Duffield, a physician and pharmacist. In 1860 Dr. Duffield owned a small drugstore at the corner of Gratiot and Woodward Avenues. Dr. Duffield made a variety of pharmaceutical preparations, including Hoffman’s anodyne and mercurial ointment, but was overwhelmed by the operations of the business. <ref name="bull hist">{{cite journal| title= THE EARLY HISTORY OF PARKE-DAVIS AND COMPANY| journal= [[Bull. Hist. Chem.]]|volume= 25| issue= 1| year= 2000| last= Hoefle| first= Milton L.| url= http://www.scs.illinois.edu/~mainzv/HIST/bulletin_open_access/v25-1/v25-1%20p28-34.pdf}}</ref>

A partnership of Dr. Duffield and [[HErvey Parke|Hervey Coke Parke]] was formed in October 1866, with George S. Davis becoming a third partner in 1867. Parke was a businessman looking for business opportunities and Davis an ambitious man with skills in sales.<ref name="bull hist"/> Duffield withdrew in 1869 because of poor health and an interest in practicing medicine. The name Parke, Davis & Company was formally adopted in 1871, being incorporated in 1875. {{citation needed|date= January 2015}} 

In 1871 the company sent expeditions to Central and South America and the West Indies in search of medicinal plants. The company produced an herbal laxative drug [[Rhamnus purshiana|Cascara]] found from Native Americans in the Pacific Northwest.<ref name="bull hist"/>

It was once the world's largest [[pharmaceutical company]], and is credited with building the first modern pharmaceutical laboratory and developing the first systematic methods of performing [[clinical trials]] of new medications. The [[Parke-Davis Research Laboratory]] is a [[National Historic Landmark]]; the surrounding [[Parke-Davis and Company Pharmaceutical Company Plant]] is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

The production facility on Parkdale Road in what was then Avon Township MI (site now in Rochester MI) was also a landmark in that vicinity, and is now used by PAR Pharmaceuticals.

Parke-Davis was acquired by [[Warner-Lambert]] in 1970. Warner-Lambert was bought by [[Pfizer Inc.|Pfizer]] in 2000.{{citation needed|date= January 2015}}

In the case of ''[[Franklin v. Parke-Davis]]'' (2002) the company was accused of illegal [[marketing]] practices, including the promotion of [[Off-label use|off-label]] uses of its anticonvulsant medication [[Neurontin]].<ref>[http://bipolar.about.com/cs/neurontin/a/neurontin_suit.htm Suit: Neurontin Marketed Illegally for Bipolar Disorder]. ''About.com''. May 16, 2004.</ref> The drug had only been approved for use in patients with [[epilepsy]], but in 2001 over 80% of its $1.8 billion in sales were for indications unapproved by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]]. In 2004, Pfizer "admitted that Parke-Davis aggressively marketed Neurontin by illicit means for unrelated conditions including bipolar disorder, pain, migraine headaches, and drug and [[alcohol withdrawal]]", and consented to $430 million in penalties although it claimed the violations originated in 1996, well before Pfizer's acquisition of Warner-Lambert.<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/05/14/BUGKK6L0LB1.DTL Huge penalty in drug fraud Pfizer settles felony case in Neurontin off-label promotion]. San Francisco Chronicle. Friday, May 14, 2004.</ref>

As announced on January 22, 2007, Pfizer closed its research facilities in Ann Arbor, Michigan.<ref>[https://www.forbes.com/2007/01/22/pfizer-changes-layoffs-biz-cz_mh_0122changes.html?partner=biotech_newsletter At Pfizer, Brutal Cuts And Big Changes]</ref>

== Products ==
<!--  [[Adrenaline (disambiguation)]] links to this section  -->

One of Parke-Davis' early products was an [[amylase]] isolated from ''[[Aspergillus oryzae]]'' by Dr. [[Jokichi Takamine]].<ref>[http://www.deerland-enzymes.com/files/Dr_Jokichi%20Takamine_Bio.pdf Bennett, Joan and Yamomoto, Yutaka. Dr. Jokichi Takamine: Japanese father of American Biotechnology]. ''Deerland Enzymes''.</ref> The enzyme was originally intended for use in [[distilleries]], but was more successfully marketed as "Taka-diastase" for [[dyspepsia]].

In addition, Parke-Davis distributed Coley's toxins, the first cancer vaccine, which was developed by William Coley to treat osteosarcoma.  In addition, the company entered into a distribution agreement with the Inoculation Department of St Mary's (London) and distributed a number of vaccines for infectious diseases and even acne and cancer.<ref name="fleming">{{cite book| title=Penicillin Man: Alexander Fleming and the Antibiotic Revolution| author=Kevin Brown| url=https://www.amazon.com/Penicillin-Man-Alexander-Antibiotic-Revolution/dp/0750931531| publisher=The History Press| date=December 2005| isbn=978-0750931533}}</ref>

Another of the company's products developed by Takamine was a pure form of adrenaline. The compound was patented in 1900 and trademarked as "Adrenalin". Because of the similarity of this name to "Adrenaline", the use of the alternative name "epinephrine" for generics was mandated in the United States and is used to this day. Parke-Davis filed a lawsuit against [[H. K. Mulford Company]] alleging infringement of its Adrenalin patents.  The ruling in favor of Parke-Davis by judge [[Learned Hand]] is considered crucial to modern patent law.

Like [[Bayer]] with [[heroin]]; before the criminalization of [[cocaine]], the drug was sold by Parke-Davis in various forms, including cigarettes, powder, and even a cocaine mixture that could be injected directly into the user’s veins with the included needle. The company promised that its cocaine products would "supply the place of food, make the coward brave, the silent eloquent and ... render the sufferer insensitive to pain." In October 1915, [[Aleister Crowley]], author of ''[[Diary of a Drug Fiend]]'' and ''[[The Confessions of Aleister Crowley]]'', stopped by Parke-Davis in Detroit, where, according to Crowley, the cooperation was complete. "[They] were kind enough to interest themselves in my researches in [[Anhalonium lewinii]] (peyote) and made me some special preparations on the lines indicated by my experience which proved greatly superior to previous preparations."<ref>{{cite book |last=Sutin |first=Lawrence |title=Do What Thou Wilt: a life of Aleister Crowley |page=253 |year=2000 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0312252434}}</ref> Parke-Davis also was the original manufacturer and patent holder of 
[[phencyclidine]] (PCP) which is currently listed as a Schedule II drug in the United States. They also developed Ketalar ([[ketamine]] hydrochloride), a general anesthetic and dissociative drug, in 1962.

Parke-Davis marketed the first widely available [[epilepsy]] treatment, [[Dilantin]], which was approved in 1939, although it discovered neither the compound nor the application on its own.<ref>[http://www.remarkablemedicine.com/Medicine/flaw2.html A Flaw in the System]. ''remarkablemedicine.com'' Accessed May 16, 2006.</ref>

In partnership with the Japanese firm [[Daiichi Sankyo Co.]] and the British firm [[Glaxo Wellcome]], Parke-Davis developed and marketed the anti-diabetic drug Rezulin ([[troglitazone]]) in the late 1990s. The drug was withdrawn in 2000 because of liver toxicity.

The first bacterial [[vaccine]] was developed by Parke-Davis, and the company was thus known as a pioneer in the field of [[Vaccinology]]. It was also among the five firms contracted to manufacture the original [[Jonas Salk|Salk]] killed-virus [[polio vaccine|vaccine]].<ref>Bayly, M. Beddow. The Story of the Salk Anti-Poliomyelitis Vaccine. 1956.</ref> A combination of the [[DPT vaccine|DPT]] and polio vaccines, called [[Quadrigen]], was developed in 1954 and approved in 1959. Quadrigen was later removed from the market in 1968 after a series of lawsuits pertaining to adverse effects in vaccinated children.  Parke-Davis also produced the broad-spectrum antibiotic [[chloramphenicol]], which was a blockbuster product before discovery of its association with [[aplastic anemia]].

Other products popularized by the company included [[anti-infective]]s and brands of [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]s.
