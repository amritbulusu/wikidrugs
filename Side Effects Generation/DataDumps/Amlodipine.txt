== Interactions ==
Several drugs interact with amplodipine to increase levels of amlodipine in the body. CYP3A inhibitors, by nature of inhibiting the enzyme that metabolizes amlodipine, [[CYP3A4]], is one such drug. Others include the calcium-channel blocker [[diltiazem]], the antibiotic [[clarithromycin]], and possibly some antifungals.<ref name=norvasc /> Amlodipine also causes several drugs to increase in levels, including [[cyclosporine]], [[simvastatin]], and [[tacrolimus]] (the increase in the last one being more likely in people with CYP3A5*3 genetic polymorphisms).<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Effect of CYP3A5*3 Polymorphism on Pharmacokinetic Drug Interaction between Tacrolimus and Amlodipine|url = https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/dmpk/28/5/28_DMPK-12-RG-148/_pdf|journal = Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics|date = 2013|pages = 398–405|volume = 28|issue = 5|doi = 10.2133/dmpk.DMPK-12-RG-148|first = Xiao-cong|last = Zuo|first2 = Ya-nan|last2 = Zhou|first3 = Bi-kui|last3 = Zhang|first4 = Guo-ping|last4 = Yang|first5 = Ze-neng|last5 = Cheng|first6 = Hong|last6 = Yuan|first7 = Dong-sheng|last7 = Ouyang|first8 = Shi-kun|last8 = Liu|first9 = Jeffrey S.|last9 = Barrett|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170811010432/https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/dmpk/28/5/28_DMPK-12-RG-148/_pdf|archivedate = 11 August 2017|df = dmy-all}}</ref> When more than 20&nbsp;mg of simvastatin, a [[lipid-lowering agent]], is given with amlodipine, there is also an increased risk of [[myopathy]].<ref>{{Cite web|work = Drug Safety and Availability|title = FDA Drug Safety Communication: New restrictions, contraindications, and dose limitations for Zocor (simvastatin) to reduce the risk of muscle injury|url = http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm256581.htm|publisher = FDA|accessdate = 2015-11-05|author = Center for Drug Evaluation and Research|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130106223019/http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm256581.htm|archivedate = 6 January 2013|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Giving amlodipine with [[Viagra]] increases the risk of hypotension.<ref name="norvasc" /><ref name="ASHP2016" />

== Pharmacology ==
=== Mechanism of action ===
Amlodipine is an angioselective [[calcium channel blocker]] and inhibits the movement of calcium ions into [[vascular smooth muscle]] cells and [[cardiac muscle cell]]s which inhibits the contraction of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle cells. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells. This causes vasodilation and a reduction [[peripheral vascular resistance]], thus lowering blood pressure. Its effects on cardiac muscle also prevent excessive constriction in the [[coronary arteries]].<ref name=ASHP2016/>

Negative [[inotrope|inotropic]] effects can be detected ''in vitro'', but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Among the two stereoisomers [''R''(+), ''S''(–)], the (–) isomer has been reported to be more active than the (+) isomer.<ref name="J.R.

*[[Stable angina]]: amlodipine reduces the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the heart works and reduces the [[rate pressure product]], thereby lowering myocardial oxygen demand, at any given level of exercise.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Cardiovascular Diseases: From Molecular Pharmacology to Evidence-Based Therapeutics|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rXy0BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA189|publisher = John Wiley & Sons|date = 2015|isbn = 9780470915370|first = Y.

Side effects are quite rare, but cats on amlodipine have a possibility of developing [[azotemia]] (high concentration of nitrogen), [[hypokalemia]], [[reflex tachycardia]], [[lethargy]], and weight loss.
