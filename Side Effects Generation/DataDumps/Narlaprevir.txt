== Mechanism of action==
Narlaprevir is an oral NS3 serine protease inhibitor of hepatitis C virus. It inhibits viral [[DNA replication|replication]] in infected host [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s.<ref name = "Tong" /> The mechanism of inhibition involves reversible [[Covalent bond|covalent binding]] of narlaprevir with NS3 protease [[active site]] via the [[amide|ketoamide]] functional group.<ref name = "Tong" />

Narlaprevir does not bind to human [[protease]]s, with the exception of [[cathepsin B]] (69% inhibition). Overexpression of cathepsin B is associated with the development of malignancies.<ref name = "Arasappan">{{cite journal | last1 = Arasappan | first1 = A | last2 = Bennett | first2 = F | last3 = Bogen | first3 = SL | last4 = Venkatraman | first4 = S | last5 = Blackman | first5 = M | last6 = Chen | first6 = KX | last7 = Hendrata | first7 = S | last8 = Huang | first8 = Y | last9 = Huelgas | first9 = RM | last10 = Nair | first10 = L | last11 = Padilla | first11 = AI | last12 = Pan | first12 = W | last13 = Pike | first13 = R | last14 = Pinto | first14 = P | last15 = Ruan | first15 = S | last16 = Sannigrahi | first16 = M | last17 = Velazquez | first17 = F | last18 = Vibulbhan | first18 = B | last19 = Wu | first19 = W | last20 = Yang | first20 = W | last21 = Saksena | first21 = AK | last22 = Girijavallabhan | first22 = V | last23 = Shih | first23 = NY | last24 = Kong | first24 = J | last25 = Meng | first25 = T | last26 = Jin | first26 = Y | last27 = Wong | first27 = J | last28 = McNamara | first28 = P | last29 = Prongay | first29 = A | last30 = Madison | first30 = V | last31 = Piwinski | first31 = JJ | last32 = Cheng | first32 = KC | last33 = Morrison | first33 = R | last34 = Malcolm | first34 = B | last35 = Tong | first35 = X | last36 = Ralston | first36 = R | last37 = Njoroge | first37 = FG | title = Discovery of Narlaprevir (SCH 900518): A Potent, Second Generation HCV NS3 Serine Protease Inhibitor | journal = ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters | date = 13 May 2010 | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 64–69 | doi = 10.1021/ml9000276 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4007962/pdf/ml9000276.pdf | pmc = 4007962}}</ref>

== Usage ==
;Indications

Treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection genotype 1 in combination with [[ritonavir]], pegylated [[Interferon alfa-2b|interferon alfa]] and [[ribavirin]], in patients older than 18 years with compensated [[liver]] disease who are treatment-naïve or have failed dual combination of pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin.

== Efficacy studies==
H. Reesink et al. (2009) demonstrated narlaprevir safety and antiviral activity both as a single agent and in dual combination with pegylated interferon alfa-2b.<ref name = "Reesink">{{cite journal | last1 = Reesink | first1 = H | last2 = Bergmann | first2 = J | last3 = de Bruijne | first3 = J | last4 = Weegink | first4 = C | last5 = van Lier | first5 = J | last6 = van Vliet | first6 = A | last7 = Keung | first7 = A | last8 = Li | first8 = J | last9 = O'Mara | first9 = E | last10 = Treitel | first10 = M | last11 = Hughes | first11 = E | last12 = Janssen | first12 = H | last13 = de Knegt | first13 = R | title = Safety and Antiviral Activity of SCH 900518 Administered as Monotherapy and in Combination with Peginterferon Alfa-2B to Naive and Treatment-Experienced HCV-1 Infected Patients | journal = Journal of Hepatology | date = 2009 | volume = 50 | issue = Supp. 1 | pages = S35–S36}}</ref>

X. Tong et al. (2010) demonstrated narlaprevir activity against HCV [[mutation]]s causing [[Drug resistance|resistance]] to [[boceprevir]] and [[telaprevir]].<ref name = "Tong" />

In the year 2016 a large-scale phase III multicenter PIONEER study was completed. Sustained virologic response (SVR) was 89% in treatment-naïve and 70% in treatment-experienced patients 24 weeks after the end of treatment in the narlaprevir group, whereas in the control group SVR was only 59.6% in treatment-naïve and 24.5% in treatment-experienced patients on dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin. Adding narlaprevir to dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin did not affect narlaprevir safety profile. A phase I study of narlaprevir [[pharmacokinetics]] in combination with ritonavir in patients with compensated [[cirrhosis]] was also completed (Liver Meeting AASLD, 13–17 February 2015, San Francisco, California, USA).<ref name = "RPharm" /><ref>{{cite web | last1 = Bakulin | first1 = IG | last2 = Abdurakhmanov | first2 = DT | last3 = Bogomolov | first3 = PO | last4 = Burnevich | first4 = EZ | last5 = Voloshina | first5 = NB | last6 = Geivandova | first6 = NI | last7 = Galushko | first7 = MY | last8 = Zhdanov | first8 = KV | last9 = Znoyko | first9 = OO | last10 = Ivashkin | first10 = VT | last11 = Kizhlo | first11 = SN | last12 = Klimova | first12 = EA | last13 = Konstantinov | first13 = DY | last14 = Mayevskaya | first14 = MV | last15 = Mironova | first15 = NI | last16 = Morozov | first16 = VG | last17 = Nikitin | first17 = IG | last18 = Osipenko | first18 = MF | last19 = Pasechnikov | first19 = VD | last20 = Sagalova | first20 = OI | last21 = Khayertynova | first21 = IM | last22 = Chulanov | first22 = VP | last23 = Yakovlev | first23 = AA | last24 = Koloda | first24 = DE | last25 = Tikhonova | first25 = NY | last26 = Samsonov | first26 = MY | last27 = Sandler | first27 = YG | last28 = Keiyan | first28 = VA | title = Preliminary Results of a Phase III Study of New Protease Inhibitor Narlaprevir in Treatment-Naïve and Treatment-Experieced Patiens with Chronic Hepatitis C Genotype 1 (PIONEER Study) | url = http://гастросессия.рф/d/722621/d/02.03.16_tezisy(3).pdf | page = 20 | language = Russian}}</ref>

According to professor I.G. Bakulin, the head of the Department of Hepatology of the Moscow clinical research center and chief gastroenterologist of Moscow government healthcare department, the regulatory approval of narlaprevir has become a major milestone accomplished in the fight against hepatitis C in Russia.<ref name = "RPharm" />
