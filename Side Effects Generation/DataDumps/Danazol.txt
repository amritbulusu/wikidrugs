==Medical uses==
Danazol is used primarily in the treatment of [[endometriosis]]. It has also been used – mostly [[off-label]] – for other indications, namely in the management of [[menorrhagia]], [[fibrocystic breast disease]], [[immune thrombocytopenic purpura]], [[premenstrual syndrome]], [[mastodynia|breast pain]], and [[hereditary angioedema]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Rod Flower |author2=Humphrey P.

==Contraindications==
Danazol is contraindicated during [[pregnancy]] because it has the potential to [[virilization|virilize]] female [[fetus]]es. Women taking danazol should practice effective [[contraception]] to prevent pregnancy if [[human sexual activity|sexually active]].<ref name=Hoffman />

Since danazol is [[metabolism|metabolized]] by the [[liver]], it cannot be used by patients with [[liver disease]], and in patients receiving long-term therapy, liver function must be monitored on a periodic basis.

==Side effects==
{{See also|Anabolic steroid#Adverse effects}}

Androgenic side effects are of concern, as some women taking danazol may experience unwanted hair growth ([[hirsutism]]), [[acne vulgaris|acne]], irreversible [[voice change|deepening of the voice]],<ref name="NieschlagBehre2010" /> or adverse [[lipid profile|blood lipid profile]]s.<ref name=Hoffman /> In addition, [[breast atrophy]] and decreased breast size may occur.<ref name="NieschlagBehre2010" /> The drug may also cause [[hot flash]]es, [[elevated transaminases|elevation of liver enzyme]]s, and [[mood disorder|mood changes]].<ref name=Hoffman /> Some patients who use danazol experience [[weight gain]] and [[Water retention (medicine)|fluid retention]]. Due to its side effects, danazol is seldom prescribed continuously beyond six months.

The use of danazol for endometriosis has been linked to an increased risk of [[ovarian cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cottreau CM, Ness RB, Modugno F, Allen GO, Goodman MT |title=Endometriosis and Its Treatment with Danazol or Lupron in Relation to Ovarian Cancer |journal=Clinical Cancer Research |volume=9 |issue= 14|pages=5142–4 |year=2003 |pmid=14613992 |doi=}}</ref> Patients with endometriosis have specific risk factors for ovarian cancer, so this may not apply for other uses.

Danazol, like most other androgenic drugs, has been linked with an increased risk of [[liver tumors]]. These are generally [[benign tumor|benign]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Velazquez I, Alter BP |title=Androgens and liver tumors: Fanconi's anemia and non-Fanconi's conditions |journal=Am. J.

==Pharmacology==
Danazol possesses a complex [[pharmacology]], with multiple [[mechanisms of action]].<ref name="JonesRock2015" /><ref name="ThomasRock2012">{{cite book|author1=Eric J.

===Modulation of steroid hormone receptors===
The [[steroid hormone receptor]] [[pharmacodynamics|activity profile]] of danazol is as follows:<ref name="NieschlagBehre2010" /><ref name="ThomasRock2012" />

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Receptor !! Affinity !! Effect
|-
| [[Androgen receptor]] || 90 nM || [[Agonist]]
|-
| [[Progesterone receptor]] || 6,000 nM || [[Agonist-antagonist]]
|-
| [[Glucocorticoid receptor]] || 5,000 nM || Agonist
|-
| [[Estrogen receptor]] || 80,000 nM || Agonist
|}

As such, danazol is described as a possessing high affinity for the AR, moderate affinity for the PR and GR, and poor affinity for the ER.<ref name="ThomasRock2012" /> As an androgen, danazol is described as weak, being about 200-fold less potent than testosterone in [[bioassay]]s.<ref name="AltchekDeligdisch2003" /> The drug can act as both an agonist and [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of the PR depending on the bioassay, indicating that it could be regarded as a [[selective progesterone receptor modulator]].<ref name="ThomasRock2012" /> Although the [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] and [[intrinsic activity|efficacy]] of danazol itself at the PR are relatively low, ethisterone, one of the major metabolites of danazol, is described as a weak progestogen (and has been employed clinically as a progestogenic contraceptive), and this presumably balances the ''[[in vivo]]'' progestogenic activity of danazol.<ref name="Kurman2013">{{cite book|author=Robert J. Kurman|title=Blaustein's Pathology of the Female Genital Tract|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sM3eBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA390|date=17 April 2013|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4757-3889-6|pages=390–}}</ref> The activity of danazol at the ER is considered to be minimal, although at very high concentrations the drug can act significantly as an ER agonist.<ref name="ThomasRock2012" /> Danazol is considered to act significantly as an agonist of the GR, and thus, as a [[glucocorticoid]].<ref name="ThomasRock2012" /> In accordance, it can [[immunosuppression|suppress the immune system]].<ref name="JonesRock2015" /><ref name="ThomasRock2012" /><ref name="AltchekDeligdisch2003" />

===Inhibition of steroidogenesis enzymes===
Danazol has been found to act as an inhibitor of the following steroidogenesis enzymes:<ref name="ThomasRock2012" />

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Enzyme !! Affinity (K<sub>i</sub>) !! Inhibition type !! Est. inhibition at 2 μM
|-
| [[Cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme]] || 20 μM || Competitive || ?
|-
| [[3β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase|3β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Δ<sup>5-4</sup> isomerase]] || 5.8 μM || Competitive || 4.3%
|-
| [[17α-Hydroxylase]] || 2.4 μM || Competitive || 2.9%
|-
| [[17,20-Lyase]] || 1.9 μM || Competitive || 3.9%
|-
| [[17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]] || 4.4 μM || Competitive || 15%
|-
| [[21-Hydroxylase]] || 0.8 μM || Competitive || 37%
|-
| [[11β-Hydroxylase]] || 1 μM || Competitive || 21%
|-
| [[Aromatase]] || >100 μM || – || 0%
|}

Danazol has also been found to be a weak inhibitor of [[steroid sulfatase]] (K<sub>i</sub> = 2.3–8.2&nbsp;μM), the enzyme that converts {{abbrlink|DHEA-S|dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate}} to {{abbrlink|DHEA|dehydroepiandrosterone}} and [[estrone sulfate]] to [[estrone]] (which can then subsequently be transformed into estrone (with [[androstenedione]] as an intermediate) and [[estradiol]], respectively),<ref name="Shields-BotellaChetrite2005">{{cite journal|last1=Shields-Botella|first1=J.|last2=Chetrite|first2=G.|last3=Meschi|first3=S.|last4=Pasqualini|first4=J.R.|title=Effect of nomegestrol acetate on estrogen biosynthesis and transformation in MCF-7 and T47-D breast cancer cells|journal=The Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology|volume=93|issue=1|year=2005|pages=1–13|issn=0960-0760|doi=10.1016/j.jsbmb.2004.11.004|pmid=15748827}}</ref> though another study reported its inhibition to be potent and potentially clinically relevant.<ref name="pmid6238495">{{cite journal | vauthors = Carlström K, Döberl A, Pousette A, Rannevik G, Wilking N | title = Inhibition of steroid sulfatase activity by danazol | journal = Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand Suppl | volume = 123 | issue = | pages = 107–11 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6238495 | doi = | url = }}</ref> Although in contradiction with the above data, another study found that danazol weakly inhibited aromatase as well, with 44% inhibition at a concentration of 10&nbsp;μM.<ref name="Shields-BotellaChetrite2005" />

For reference, circulating concentrations of danazol are in the range of 2&nbsp;μM at a dosage of 600&nbsp;mg/day in women.<ref name="ThomasRock2012" />

In accordance with the above, clinical studies have demonstrated that danazol directly and markedly inhibits [[adrenal gland|adrenal]], [[ovary|ovarian]], and [[testicle|testicular]] steroidogenesis ''[[in vivo]]''.<ref name="ThomasRock2012" /> The enzymatic production of [[estradiol]], [[progesterone]], and [[testosterone]] have all specifically been found to be inhibited.<ref name="ThomasRock2012" />

===Occupation and downregulation of carrier proteins===
Danazol is known to bind to two steroid hormone carrier proteins: [[sex hormone-binding globulin]] (SHBG), which binds [[androgen]]s and [[estrogen]]s; and [[transcortin]] (corticosteroid-binding globulin), which binds progesterone and [[cortisol]].<ref name="NieschlagBehre2010" /><ref name="ThomasRock2012" /> Binding of danazol to SHBG is considered to be more important clinically.<ref name="ThomasRock2012" /> By occupying SHBG and transcortin, danazol increases the ratio of free to [[plasma protein]]-bound testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, and cortisol.<ref name="NieschlagBehre2010" /><ref name="ThomasRock2012" /> The following table shows the difference in testosterone levels in untreated premenopausal women and women treated with danazol:<ref name="ThomasRock2012" />

{| class="wikitable"
|+ style="text-align: center;" | Testosterone protein binding in women
|-
! Group !! Free !! Albumin !! SHBG
|-
| '''Normal (no danazol)''' || 1% || 39% || 60%
|-
| '''Danazol treatment''' || 3% || 79% || 18%
|}

As can be seen, the percentage of free testosterone is tripled in women being treated with danazol.<ref name="ThomasRock2012" /><ref name="HelmsQuan2006">{{cite book|author1=Richard A. Helms|author2=David J. Quan|title=Textbook of Therapeutics: Drug and Disease Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aVmRWrknaWgC&pg=PA383|year=2006|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-5734-8|pages=383–}}</ref> The ability of danazol to increase free testosterone levels suggests that a portion of its weak androgenic effects are mediated indirectly by facilitating the activity of testosterone and [[dihydrotestosterone]] through the displacement of them from SHBG.<ref name="ThomasRock2012" /><ref name="HelmsQuan2006" /> In addition to binding to and occupying SHBG however, danazol also decreases the hepatic production of SHBG and therefore SHBG levels, and so downregulation of SHBG may be involved as well.<ref name="NieschlagBehre2010" /><ref name="ThomasRock2012" /> Danazol likely decreases hepatic production of SHBG by reducing estrogenic and increasing androgenic activity in the liver (as androgens and estrogens increase and decrease, respectively, hepatic SHBG synthesis).<ref name="WakelinMaibach2015">{{cite book|author1=Sarah H. Wakelin|author2=Howard I. Maibach|author3=Clive B.

It is noteworthy that 2-hydroxymethylethisterone, a major metabolite of danazol, circulates at concentrations 5–10 times greater than those of danazol and is twice as potent as danazol in displacing testosterone from SHBG.<ref name="Westphal2012">{{cite book|author=Ulrich Westphal|title=Steroid-Protein Interactions II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3DD6CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA256|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-82486-9|pages=256–}}</ref> As such, most of the occupation of SHBG by danazol may actually be due to this metabolite.<ref name="Westphal2012" />

===Antigonadotropic activity===
Via its weak progestogenic and androgenic activity, through activation of the PR and AR in the [[pituitary gland]], danazol produces [[antigonadotropic]] effects.<ref name="ThomasRock2012" /> Although its does not significantly affect basal [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) and [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) levels in premenopausal women (and hence does not profoundly suppress [[gonadotropin]] or sex hormone levels like other, stronger antigonadotropins do),<ref name="TollisonSatterthwaite2002">{{cite book|author1=C.

Because danazol reduces estrogen production and levels,<ref name="TollisonSatterthwaite2002" /> it has functional [[antiestrogen]]ic properties.<ref name="Taylor1998">{{cite book|author=Robert B.

==Research==

===Telomere diseases===
A 2016 phase 1–2 prospective study orally administered 800&nbsp;mg per day to 27 patients with [[telomere]] diseases. The primary efficacy endpoint was a 20% reduction in the annual rate of telomere attrition measured. Toxic effects formed the primary safety endpoint. The study was halted early, after telomere attrition was reduced in all 12 patients who could be evaluated. 12 of 27 patients achieved the primary efficacy end point, 11 of whom increased telomere length at 24 months. [[Hematology|Hematologic]] responses (secondary efficacy endpoint) occurred in 10 of 12 patients who could be evaluated at 24 months. Elevated liver-enzyme levels and muscle cramps (known adverse effects) of grade 2 or less occurred in 41% and 33% of the patients, respectively.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Townsley|first=Danielle M.|last2=Dumitriu|first2=Bogdan|last3=Liu|first3=Delong|last4=Biancotto|first4=Angélique|last5=Weinstein|first5=Barbara|last6=Chen|first6=Christina|last7=Hardy|first7=Nathan|last8=Mihalek|first8=Andrew D.|last9=Lingala|first9=Shilpa|date=2016-05-18|title=Danazol Treatment for Telomere Diseases|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1515319|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|language=EN|volume=374|issue=20|pages=1922–1931|doi=10.1056/nejmoa1515319}}</ref>
