'''Acipimox''' (trade name '''Olbetam''' in Europe) is a [[niacin]] derivative used as a [[lipid-lowering agent]]. It reduces [[triglyceride]] levels and increases [[High-density lipoprotein|HDL]] cholesterol.
It may have less marked adverse effects than niacin, although it is unclear whether the recommended dose is as effective as standard doses of niacin.

==Contraindications==
Contraindications are [[peptic ulcer]]s, acute bleeding, fresh [[myocardial infarction]], [[acute decompensated heart failure]], and severe [[renal insufficiency]].<ref name="AC" />

==Adverse effects==
As with niacin and related drugs, the most common adverse effects are [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]] (associated with [[prostaglandin D2|prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub>]]<ref name="Benyo" />) and gastrointestinal disturbances such as [[indigestion]], which occur in at least 10% of patients.<ref name="AC" /> Flushing can be reduced by taking [[aspirin]] 20 to 30 minutes before taking acipimox. [[Palpitations]] have also been described.{{fact|date=July 2016}} High doses can cause headache,<ref name="Dinnendahl" /> and precipitate [[gout]].{{fact|date=July 2016}}  In contrast to niacin, no impairment of [[glucose tolerance]] and no disorders of liver function have been found in studies, even under high doses of acipimox.<ref name="AC" /><ref name="Dinnendahl" />

==Interactions==
No interactions with other drugs are known. Theoretically, combination with [[statin]]s and [[fibrates]] could increase the incidence of [[myalgia]]. Alcohol can increase the risk of flushing.<ref name="AC" /><ref name="Dinnendahl" />

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===
Like niacin, acipimox acts on the [[niacin receptor 1]], inhibiting the enzyme [[triglyceride lipase]]. This reduces the concentration of [[fatty acid]]s in the blood plasma and their inflow into the liver. Consequently, [[Very low-density lipoprotein|VLDL]] cholesterol production in the liver is reduced, which leads indirectly to a reduction in [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]] and increase in HDL cholesterol.<ref name="AC" /><ref name="Benyo" />

===Pharmacokinetics===
Acipimox is completely absorbed from the gut. It is not bound to blood [[plasma protein]]s and not metabolized. Elimination occurs in two phases, the first having a half-life of two hours, the second of 12 to 14 hours. The substance is eliminated via the kidney.<ref name="AC" />
