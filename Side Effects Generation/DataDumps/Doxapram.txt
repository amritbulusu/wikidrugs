'''Doxapram hydrochloride''' (marketed as '''Dopram''', Stimulex or Respiram) is a respiratory stimulant. Administered [[intravenous]]ly, doxapram stimulates an increase in [[Lung volumes|tidal volume]], and [[respiration (physiology)|respiratory rate]].

==Mechanism of action==
[[File:Doxapram.JPG|thumb|alt=photograph of a vial of doxapram|A vial of doxapram]]

Doxapram stimulates [[chemoreceptor]]s in the [[carotid bodies]] of the carotid arteries, which in turn,  stimulates the respiratory centre in the [[brain stem]].

==Appearance==
Doxapram is a white to off-white, odorless, crystalline powder that is stable in light and air. It is soluble in water, sparingly soluble in alcohol and practically insoluble in ether. Injectable products have a pH from 3.5-5. [[Benzyl alcohol]] or [[chlorobutanol]] is added as a preservative agent in the commercially available injections.

==Uses==
Doxapram is used in [[intensive care]] settings to stimulate the respiratory rate in patients with [[respiratory failure]]. It may be useful for treating respiratory depression in patients who have taken excessive doses of drugs such as [[buprenorphine]] or fentanyl analogues which may fail to respond adequately to treatment with [[naloxone]].<ref>[http://www.naabt.org/documents/packageinsert.pdf Buprenorphine Drug Data Sheet]</ref>

It is equally as effective as [[pethidine]] in suppressing shivering after [[surgery]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Singh | first1 = P | last2 = Dimitriou | first2 = V | last3 = Mahajan | first3 = RP | last4 = Crossley | first4 = AW | title = Double-blind comparison between doxapram and pethidine in the treatment of postanaesthetic shivering | journal = British journal of anaesthesia | volume = 71 | issue = 5 | pages = 685â€“8 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8251281 | doi = 10.1093/bja/71.5.685 }}</ref>

==Side effects==
Side effects include high blood pressure, [[panic attack]]s, rapid heart rate, [[tremor]], sweating and vomiting. [[Epileptic seizure|Convulsions]] have been reported. Its use is relatively contraindicated in people with [[coronary heart disease]], [[epilepsy]], and high blood pressure. It is also contraindicated in newborns and small children, mainly due to the presence of benzyl alcohol, which is included as a [[preservative]].
