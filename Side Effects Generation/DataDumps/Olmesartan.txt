'''Olmesartan medoxomil''' is an [[angiotensin II receptor antagonist]] which is used for the treatment of [[hypertension|high blood pressure]]. It was developed by [[Daiichi Sankyo Co.|Sankyo]] in 1995, and is sold under the trade name '''Benicar''', among others. An ester [[prodrug]], it is completely and rapidly [[hydrolyzed]] to the active acid form, '''olmesartan''' (RNH-6270).<ref name=Aulakh_2007>{{Citation

==Indications==
Olmesartan is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.<ref name=RxList>{{cite web

The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has determined that the benefits of Benicar continue to outweigh its potential risks when used for the treatment of patients with high blood pressure according to the drug label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/fda/benicar-olmesartan-ongoing-safety-review-12946.html |title=FDA Alert: Benicar (olmesartan): Ongoing Safety Review |publisher=Drugs.com |accessdate=2013-06-27}}</ref>

==Contraindications==

[[Contraindication]]s for treatment with olmesartan include [[biliary obstruction]]. Another major contraindication is pregnancy; reports in the scientific literature reveal fetal malformations for pregnant women taking sartan-derived drugs.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hünseler | first1 = C | last2 = Paneitz | first2 = A | last3 = Friedrich | first3 = D | last4 = Lindner | first4 = U | last5 = Oberthuer | first5 = A | last6 = Körber | first6 = F | last7 = Schmitt | first7 = K | last8 = Welzing | first8 = L | last9 = Müller | first9 = A | last10 = Herkenrath | first10 = P | last11 = Hoppe | first11 = B | last12 = Gortner | first12 = L | last13 = Roth | first13 = B | last14 = Kattner | first14 = E | last15 = Schaible | first15 = T | date = Jan 2011 | title = Angiotensin II receptor blocker induced fetopathy: 7 cases | url = | journal = Klin Padiatr | volume = 223 | issue = 1| pages = 10–4 | doi=10.1055/s-0030-1269895}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
The incidence of adverse effects with Benicar (the US trade name for olmesartan medoxomil) is reported as similar to placebo; the only adverse effect that occurred in >1% of patients treated with it and more frequently than placebo was dizziness (3% vs 1%).  The full prescribing information for Benicar notes as with all drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system, olmesartan is contraindicated in pregnancy and can cause injury and even death to the developing fetus. In studies of angiotensin II receptor antagonists such as olmesartan, patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen have been reported. There has been no long-term use of olmesartan medoxomil in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but similar results may be expected.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.benicar.com/pdf/prescribing_information.pdf|title=BENICAR Prescribing Information|accessdate=2011-01-20}}</ref>
Rarely, olmesartan can cause severe [[gastrointestinal issues]]. The symptoms, which include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and electrolyte abnormalities, are common among those who have [[celiac disease]].<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=De Petris G, Caldero SG, Chen L, etal |title=Histopathological changes in the gastrointestinal tract due to medications: an update for the surgical pathologist (part II of II) |journal=Int. J. Surg. Pathol. |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=202–11 | date=May  2014 |pmid=24021900 |doi=10.1177/1066896913502230 |url=}}</ref> Recent studies suggested this form of sprue-like enteropathy could be caused by the inhibition of [[Transforming growth factor beta|TGF-β]], a polypeptide cytokine that maintains intestinal homeostasis. However, it is still unclear why this action was never observed with other ARBs.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Severe Spruelike Enteropathy Associated With Olmesartan|journal = Mayo Clinic Proceedings|date = 2012-08-01|issn = 0025-6196|pmc = 3538487|pmid = 22728033|pages = 732–738|volume = 87|issue = 8|doi = 10.1016/j.mayocp.2012.06.003|first = Alberto|last = Rubio-Tapia|first2 = Margot L.|last2 = Herman|first3 = Jonas F.|last3 = Ludvigsson|first4 = Darlene G.|last4 = Kelly|first5 = Thomas F.|last5 = Mangan|first6 = Tsung-Teh|last6 = Wu|first7 = Joseph A.|last7 = Murray}}</ref>

==Dosage and administration==
The usual recommended starting dose of olmesartan is 20&nbsp;mg once daily. The dose may be increased to 40&nbsp;mg after two weeks of therapy, if further reduction in blood pressure is desirable. Doses above 40&nbsp;mg do not appear to have greater effect, and twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily.<ref name=RxList/> No adjustment of dosage is typically necessary for advanced age, renal impairment, or hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g., patients treated with diuretics), olmesartan should be initiated with caution; consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose in such cases.<ref name=RxList/> If blood pressure is not controlled by Benicar alone, a diuretic may be added. Benicar may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Benicar may be administered with or without food.<ref name=RxList/>

==Preparations==
Olmesartan and Sevikar HCT combined is marketed worldwide by [[Daiichi Sankyo]], in India by Abbott Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. under the trade name WinBP,  by Zydus Cadila under the trade name Olmy, by Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. under the trade name Olvance, Olsar by Unichem Laboratories and in Canada by Schering-Plough as Olmetec.  Several preparations containing olmesartan and other antihypertensives are available. Teva Pharmaceuticals produces a formulation containing olmesartan, amlodipine, and hydrochlorothiazide for once daily use.<ref>https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=5c128ef2-60a6-40f3-b37f-ee139fe27987</ref> Benicar HCT is the brand name of a medication containing olmesartan medoxomil in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. Benitec H, another medication containing olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide, is marketed by GlaxoSmithKline in India.
