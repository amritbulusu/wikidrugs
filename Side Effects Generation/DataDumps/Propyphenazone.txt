==Countries that have banned propyphenazone==
Excerpt from [[WHO]] comments:
::''“Propyphenazone, a [[pyrazolone]] derivative with [[anti-inflammatory]], [[analgesic]] and [[antipyretic]] activity, was introduced in 1951 for the treatment of [[rheumatic disorders]]. As it is structurally related to aminophenazone it has been associated with severe blood [[dyscrasia]]s. However, it cannot be transformed into potentially carcinogenic [[nitrosamines]] and has therefore been widely used as a replacement drug for [[aminophenazone]]. In certain countries, products containing propyphenazone have now been restricted in their indications, whereas in others they are still available, sometimes as over-the-counter preparations.”''<ref name="Rejected">{{ cite book | title = Consolidated List of Products whose Consumption and/or Sale have been Banned, Withdrawn, Severely Restricted or not Approved by Governments, Twelfth Issue | publisher = Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat | year = 2005 | location = New York | page = 232 | url = https://www.un.org/esa/coordination/CL12.pdf | format = pdf }}</ref>
