'''Phenelzine''' ('''Nardil, Nardelzine''') is a non-[[binding selectivity|selective]] and [[irreversible inhibition|irreversible]] [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]] (MAOI) of the [[hydrazine]] class which is used as an [[antidepressant]] and [[anxiolytic]]. Along with [[tranylcypromine]] and [[isocarboxazid]], phenelzine is one of the few non-selective and irreversible MAOIs still in widespread clinical use.  It is typically available in 15&nbsp;mg tablets and doses usually range from 30–90&nbsp;mg per day, with 15&nbsp;mg every day or every other day suggested as a maintenance dose following a successful course of treatment.

==Indications==
Phenelzine is used primarily in the [[therapy|treatment]] of [[major depressive disorder]] (MDD). Patients with depressive symptomology characterized as "atypical", "nonendogenous", and/or "neurotic" respond particularly well to phenelzine.<ref>Parke-Davis Division of Pfizer Inc. (2007).

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Phenelzine is a non-selective and [[Irreversible inhibition|irreversible inhibitor]] of the [[enzyme]] [[monoamine oxidase]] (MAO). It inhibits both of the respective [[isoform]]s of MAO, [[MAO-A]] and [[MAO-B]], and does so almost equally, with slight preference for the former. By inhibiting MAO, phenelzine prevents the breakdown of the [[monoamine]] [[neurotransmitter]]s [[serotonin]], [[melatonin]], [[norepinephrine]], [[epinephrine]], and [[dopamine]], as well as the [[trace amine]] [[neuromodulator]]s such as [[phenethylamine]], [[tyramine]], [[octopamine (neurotransmitter)|octopamine]], and [[tryptamine]]. This leads to an increase in the [[extracellular]] [[concentration]]s of these [[neurochemical]]s and therefore an alteration in [[neurochemistry]] and [[neurotransmission]]. This action is thought to be the primary mediator in phenelzine's [[therapeutic benefit]]s.

Phenelzine and its metabolites also inhibit at least two other enzymes to a lesser extent, of which are [[alanine transaminase]] (ALA-T),<ref>{{Cite journal

}}</ref> the latter of which is not caused by phenelzine itself, but by a phenelzine metabolite [[phenylethylidenehydrazine]] (PEH). By inhibiting ALA-T and GABA-T, phenelzine causes an increase in the [[alanine]] and [[GABA]] levels in the brain and body. GABA is the major [[inhibitory]] neurotransmitter in the [[mammalian]] [[central nervous system]], and is very important for the normal suppression of anxiety, stress, and depression. Phenelzine's action in increasing GABA concentrations may significantly contribute to its antidepressant, and especially, anxiolytic/antipanic properties, the latter of which have been considered superior to those of other antidepressants. As for ALA-T inhibition, though the consequences of disabling this enzyme are currently not well understood, there is some evidence to suggest that it is this action of the hydrazines (including phenelzine) which may be responsible for the occasional incidence of [[hepatitis]] and [[liver failure]].

Phenelzine has also been shown to metabolize to phenethylamine (PEA).<ref name="pmid4004908">{{cite journal |vauthors=Dyck LE, Durden DA, Boulton AA | title = Formation of beta-phenylethylamine from the antidepressant, beta-phenylethylhydrazine | journal = [[Biochemical Pharmacology (journal)|Biochemical Pharmacology]] | volume = 34 | issue = 11 | pages = 1925–9 |date=June 1985 | pmid = 4004908 | doi = 10.1016/0006-2952(85)90310-7| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0006-2952(85)90310-7}}</ref> PEA acts as a [[releasing agent]] of norepinephrine and dopamine, and produces effects very similar to those of [[amphetamine]], though with markedly different pharmacokinetics such as a far shorter duration of action. Phenelzine's enhancement of PEA levels may contribute further to its overall antidepressant effects to some degree. In addition, phenethylamine is a substrate for MAO-B, and treatment with MAOIs that inhibit MAO-B such as phenelzine have been shown to consistently and significantly elevate its concentrations.

Like many other antidepressants, phenelzine usually requires several weeks of treatment to achieve full therapeutic effects. The reason for this delay is not fully understood, but it is believed to be due to many factors, including achieving steady-state levels of MAO inhibition and the resulting adaptations in mean neurotransmitter levels, the possibility of necessary [[downregulation|desensitization]] of [[autoreceptor]]s which normally inhibit the release of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, and also the upregulation of enzymes such as [[serotonin N-acetyltransferase]]. Typically, a therapeutic response to MAOIs is associated with an inhibition of at least 80-85% of monoamine oxidase activity.<ref>{{Cite journal

===Pharmacokinetics===
[[Image:NardilTablets.jpg|thumb|right|Phenelzine 15 mg tablets.]]

Phenelzine is administered orally in the form of phenelzine sulfate and is rapidly absorbed from the [[gastrointestinal tract]]. Time to peak plasma concentration is 43 minutes and half-life is 11.6 hours. Unlike most other drugs, phenelzine irreversibly disables MAO, and as a result, it does not necessarily need to be present in the blood at all times for its effects to be sustained. Because of this, upon phenelzine treatment being ceased, its effects typically do not actually wear off until the body replenishes its enzyme stores, a process which can take as long as 2–3 weeks.

Phenelzine is [[metabolized]] primarily in the liver and its [[metabolite]]s are excreted in the urine. Oxidation is the primary routine of metabolism, and the major metabolites are phenylacetic acid and parahydroxyphenylacetic acid, recovered as about 73% of the excreted dose of phenelzine in the urine over the course of 96 hours after single doses. Acetylation to N<sup>2</sup>-acetylphenelzine is a minor pathway. Phenelzine may also interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes, inactivating these enzymes through formation of a heme adduct. Two other minor metabolites of phenelzine, as mentioned above, include phenylethylidenehydrazine and phenethylamine.

==Adverse effects==
Common side effects of phenelzine may include [[dizziness]], [[blurry vision]], [[dry mouth]], [[headache]], [[lethargy]], [[sedation]], [[somnolence]], [[insomnia]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[weight gain]] or [[weight loss|loss]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]], [[constipation]], [[urinary retention]], [[mydriasis]], [[muscle tremor]]s, [[hyperthermia]], [[sweating]], [[hypertension]] or [[hypotension]], [[orthostatic hypotension]], [[paresthesia]], [[hepatitis]], and [[sexual dysfunction]] (consisting of loss of [[libido]] and [[anorgasmia]]). Rare side effects usually only seen in susceptible individuals may include [[hypomania]] or [[mania]], [[psychosis]] and [[acute liver failure]], the last of which is usually only seen in people with pre-existing [[liver damage]], [[old age]], [[Long-term effects of alcohol|alcohol consumption]], or [[viral infection]].<ref>{{Cite journal

==Interactions==
{{See also|Monoamine oxidase inhibitor#Dangers}}
{{See also|Foods containing tyramine}}

The MAOIs are infamous for their problematic food restrictions and drug interactions. [[Hypertensive crisis]] may result from the overconsumption of [[tyramine]]-containing foods. As a result, patients on phenelzine and other MAOIs must avoid excess quantities of certain foods that contain tyramine such as [[aged cheese]]s and [[cured meat]]s, among others. [[Serotonin syndrome]] may result from an interaction with certain drugs which increase serotonin activity such as [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]], [[serotonin releasing agent]]s, and [[serotonin]] [[agonist]]s. Several deaths have been reported due to drug interaction-related [[serotonin syndrome]] such as the case of [[Libby Zion]].

As is the case with other MAOIs, there is a concern regarding phenelzine and the use of both [[Local anesthetic|local]] and [[general anesthetic]]s. Anyone taking phenelzine should inform their psychiatrist before proceeding with dental surgery, and surgery in any other contexts.

Phenelzine has also been linked to [[vitamin B6|vitamin B<sub>6</sub>]] [[Vitamin B6#Deficiencies|deficiency]].<ref>{{Cite journal

Both phenelzine and vitamin B<sub>6</sub> are rendered inactive upon these reactions occurring. For this reason, it may be recommended to supplement with vitamin B<sub>6</sub> while taking phenelzine.  The pyridoxine form of B<sub>6</sub> is recommended for supplementation, since this form has been shown to reduce hydrazine toxicity from phenelzine and, in contrast, the pyridoxal form has been shown to increase the toxicity of hydrazines.<ref>{{Cite journal
