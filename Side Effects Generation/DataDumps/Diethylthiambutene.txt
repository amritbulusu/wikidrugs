'''Diethylthiambutene''' ('''Thiambutene''', '''Themalon''', Diethibutin, ''N'',''N''-Diethyl-1-methyl-3,3-di-2-thienylallylamine) is an [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] drug developed in the 1950s<ref> BECKETT AH, CASY AF, HARPER NJ, PHILLIPS PM. Analgesics and their antagonists: some steric and chemical considerations. II. The influence of the basic group on physico-chemical properties and the activity of methadone and thiambutene-type compounds. Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology. 1956 Nov;8(11):860-73.</ref> which was mainly used as an [[anesthetic]] in [[veterinary]] medicine and continues, along with the other two thiambutenes [[dimethylthiambutene]] and [[ethylmethylthiambutene]] to be used for this purpose, particularly in Japan.<ref> Hayes MJ. The use of thiambutene hydrochloride. The Veterinary Record. 1968 Nov 16;83(20):528. </ref><ref> Harbison WD, Slocombe RF, Watts SJ, Stewart GA. Thiambutene and acepromazine as analgesic and preanaesthetic agents in horses and sheep. Australian Veterinary Journal. 1974 Dec;50(12):543-6. </ref> It is now under international control under Schedule I of the UN Single Convention On Narcotic Drugs 1961, presumably due to high abuse potential, although little more information is available.  It is listed under Schedule I of the US Controlled Substances Act as a Narcotic and has an ACSCN of 9616 with zero annual manufacturing quota as of 2013.
