==Medical uses==

===Skin use===
Tretinoin is most commonly used to treat [[acne vulgaris|acne]].<ref name=TopicalLabel/>  It is also used off-label to treat and reduce the appearance of [[stretch marks]] by increasing [[collagen]] production in the [[dermis]].<ref>{{cite book|title = Straight talk about cosmetic surgery|year =2007|author=Arthur W.

Other significant side effects include a risk of [[thrombosis]], [[benign intracranial hypertension]] in children, high lipids ([[hypercholesterolemia]] and/or [[hypertriglyceridemia]]), and liver damage.<ref name=OralLabel/>

There are many significant side effects from this drug that include malaise (66%), shivering (63%), hemorrhage (60%), infections (58%), peripheral edema (52%), pain (37%), chest discomfort (32%), edema (29%), disseminated intravascular coagulation (26%), weight increase (23%), injection site reactions (17%), anorexia (17%), weight decrease (17%), and myalgia (14%).<ref name=OralLabel/>

Respiratory side effects usually signify retinoic acid syndrome, and include  upper respiratory tract disorders (63%), dyspnea (60%), respiratory insufficiency (26%), pleural effusion (20%),  pneumonia (14%), rales (14%), and expiratory wheezing (14%), and many others at less than 10%.<ref name=OralLabel/>

==Mechanism of action==
For its use in cancer, its mechanism of action is unknown, but on a cellular level, laboratory test show that tretinoin forces APL cells to [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] and stops them from proliferating; in people there is evidence that it forces the primary cancerous [[promyelocyte]]s to differentiate into their final form, allowing normal cells to take over the bone marrow.<ref name=OralLabel/>

For its use in acne, the mechanism is unknown, but again on a cellular level there is evidence that it decreases the ability of [[epithelial cells]] in hair follicles to stick together, leading to fewer blackheads; it also seems to make the epithelial cells divide faster, causing the blackheads to be pushed out.<ref name=TopicalLabel/>

==History==
Tretinoin was co-developed for its use in acne by [[James Fulton (dermatologist)|James Fulton]] and [[Albert Kligman]] when they were at University of Pennsylvania in the late 1960s.<ref name=FultonObit>Vivant Pharmaceuticals, LLC Press Release.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name ''tretinoin'' is uncertain,<ref name="MWU">{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |authorlink=Merriam-Webster |title=Merriam-Webster's Unabridged Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/unabridged/ |postscript=.}}</ref><ref name="OxfordDictionaries">{{Citation |author=Oxford Dictionaries |authorlink=OxfordDictionaries.com |title=Oxford Dictionaries Online |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/ |postscript=.}}</ref> although several sources agree (one with probability,<ref name="MWU"/> one with asserted certainty<ref name="AHD">{{Citation |author=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |url=https://ahdictionary.com/ |postscript=.}}</ref>) that it probably comes from ''[[wikt:trans-#Prefix|trans-]]'' + ''[[wikt:retinoic#Adjective|retinoic]] [acid]'' + ''[[wikt:-in#Suffix|-in]]'', which is plausible given that tretinoin is the [[cis–trans isomerism|all-trans isomer]] of [[retinoic acid]]. The name ''[[isotretinoin]]'' is the same root ''tretinoin'' plus the prefix ''[[wikt:iso-#Prefix|iso-]]''. Regarding pronunciation, the following variants apply equally to both ''tretinoin'' and ''isotretinoin''. Given that ''retinoic'' is pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˌ|r|ɛ|t|ɪ|ˈ|n|oʊ|ɪ|k}},<ref name="OxfordDictionaries"/><ref name="AHD"/><ref name="MW_Medical">{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |authorlink=Merriam-Webster |title=Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/medical/ |postscript=.}}</ref><ref name="Dorlands">{{Citation |author=Elsevier |authorlink=Elsevier |title=Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary |publisher=Elsevier |url=http://dorlands.com/ |postscript=.}}</ref> it is [[natural language|natural]] that {{IPAc-en|ˌ|t|r|ɛ|t|ɪ|ˈ|n|oʊ|ɪ|n}} is a commonly heard pronunciation. Dictionary transcriptions also include {{IPAc-en|ˌ|t|r|ɪ|ˈ|t|ɪ|n|oʊ|ɪ|n}} ({{respell|tri|TIN|oh|in}})<ref name="OxfordDictionaries"/><ref name="MW_Medical"/> and {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|r|ɛ|t|ɪ|n|ɔɪ|n}}.<ref name="AHD"/><ref name="Dorlands"/>

==Research==
Tretinoin has been explored as a treatment for hair loss, potentially as a way to increase the ability of [[minoxidil]] to penetrate the scalp, but the evidence is weak and contradictory.<ref>Ralph M.
