'''Meprobamate''' — marketed as '''''Miltown''''' by [[Wallace Laboratories]] and '''''Equanil''''' by [[Wyeth]], among others — is a [[carbamate]] derivative used as an [[anxiolytic]] drug. It was the best-selling [[minor tranquilizer]] for a time, but has largely been replaced by the [[benzodiazepine]]s due to their wider [[therapeutic index]] (lower risk of toxicity at therapeutically prescribed doses) and lower incidence of serious side effects.

==History==
In the mid-1940s, Frank Milan Berger was working in a laboratory of a British drug company, looking for a preservative for penicillin, when he noticed that a compound called [[mephenesin]] had a sedative effect in laboratory rodents. Berger subsequently referred to this sedating or “tranquilizing” effect in a now-historic article, published by ''The British Journal of Pharmacology'' in 1946. However, there were three major drawbacks to the use of mephenesin as a tranquilizer: a very short duration of action, greater effect on the spinal cord than on the brain, and a weak activity.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Berger FM. | title = Mode of Action of Myanesin | journal = [[Br J Pharmacol]]. | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 241–250 | year = 1947 | doi=10.1111/j.1476-5381.1947.tb00341.x}}</ref> In May 1950, after moving to [[Carter Products]] in New Jersey, Berger and a chemist, Bernard John Ludwig, synthesized a chemically related tranquilizing compound, meprobamate, that was able to overcome these three drawbacks.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja01156a086 |vauthors=Ludwig BJ, Piech E | title = Some anticonvulsant agents derived from 1, 3-propanediol | journal = J Am Chem Soc. | volume = 73 | issue = 12 | pages = 5779–5781 | year = 1951 }}</ref>  Wallace Laboratories, a subsidiary of Carter Products, bought the license and named their new product "Miltown" after the borough of [[Milltown, New Jersey|Milltown]] in [[New Jersey]].

A December 1955 study of 101 patients at the Mississippi State Hospital in Whitfield, Mississippi, found meprobamate useful in the alleviation of "mental symptoms." Three percent of the patients made a complete recovery, 29% were greatly improved, and 50% were somewhat better. Eighteen percent realized little change. Self-destructive patients became cooperative and calmer, and experienced a resumption of logical thinking. In 50% of the cases relaxation brought about more favorable sleep habits. [[Hydrotherapy]] and all types of [[Electroconvulsive therapy|shock treatment]] were halted.<ref>"New Hope Arises On Cancer Serum", ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 28, 1955, Page 21.</ref> Meprobamate was found to help in the treatment of alcoholics by 1956.<ref>{{cite news |last = Author unknown |title = ALCOHOLIC PERIL FOUND IN DRUGS; Some Tranquilizing Therapy May Be Habit-Forming, Physicians Tell Parley |page = 28 |work = [[The New York Times]] |date = 1956-04-01 |url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00910F83F5F157A93C3A9178FD85F428585F9 |accessdate = 2009-01-23}}</ref> By 1957, over 36 million prescriptions had been filled for meprobamate in the US alone, a billion pills had been manufactured, and it accounted for fully a third of all prescriptions written.<ref>{{cite news |last = Dokoupil |first = Tony  |title = How Mother Found Her Helper |work = [[Newsweek]]  |date = 2009-01-22  |url = http://www.newsweek.com/id/180998  |accessdate = 2009-01-23}}</ref>
Berger, clinical director of Wallace Laboratories (who died on March 16, 2008, aged 94<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/21/health/research/21berger.html?partner=permalink&exprod=permalink|title=Frank Berger, 94, Miltown Creator, Dies |date=2008-03-21 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2009-02-01 |last=Carey |first=Benedict}}</ref>), described it as a relaxant of the [[central nervous system]], whereas other
[[tranquilizers]] suppressed it. A [[University of Michigan]] study found that meprobamate affected driving skills. Though patients reported being able to relax more easily, meprobamate did not completely alleviate their tense feelings. The disclosures came at a special scientific meeting at the [[Barbizon Plaza Hotel]] in [[New York City]], at which [[Aldous Huxley]] addressed an evening session. He predicted the development of many chemicals "capable of changing the quality of human consciousness", in the next few years.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10C15FD395916738FDDA00994D8415B8689F1D3 |title='BEHAVIOR' DRUGS NOW ENVISIONED; Aldous Huxley Predicts They Will Bring Re-Examining of Ethics and Religion |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1956-10-19 |accessdate=2009-02-01 }}</ref>

In January 1960, Carter Products, Inc. and American Home Products Corporation (which marketed meprobamate as ''Equanil'') were charged with having conspired to monopolize the market in mild tranquilizers. It was revealed that the sale of meprobamate earned $40,000,000 for the defendants. Of this amount American Home Products accounted for approximately 2/3 and Carter about 1/3. The U.S. government sought an order mandating that Carter make its meprobamate patent available at no charge to any company desiring to use it.<ref>

In April 1965, meprobamate was removed from the list of tranquilizers when experts ruled that the drug was a [[sedative]] instead. The ''[[U.S. Pharmacopoeia]]'' published the ruling. At the same time the ''[[Medical Letter]]'' disclosed that meprobamate could be addictive at dosage levels not much above recommended.<ref>

Production continued throughout the 1960s, but by 1970 meprobamate was listed as a controlled substance after it was discovered to cause physical and psychological dependence.

On January 19, 2012, the [[European Medicines Agency]] withdrew marketing authorization in the [[European Union]] for all medicines containing meprobamate, "due to serious side effects seen with the medicine."  The Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) "concluded that the benefits of meprobamate do not outweigh its risks."<ref>

==Pharmacology==
Although it was marketed as being safer, meprobamate has most of the pharmacological effects and dangers of the [[barbiturate]]s and acts at the barbiturate binding site (though it is less sedating at effective doses). It is reported to have some anticonvulsant properties against [[absence seizure]]s, but can exacerbate generalized [[tonic-clonic seizure]]s.

Meprobamate's mechanism of action is not completely known. It has been shown in animal studies to have effects at multiple sites in the central nervous system, including the [[thalamus]] and [[limbic system]]. Meprobamate binds to [[GABA A receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors]]<ref name="pmid9067327">{{cite journal |vauthors=Rho JM, Donevan SD, Rogawski MA |title=Barbiturate-like actions of the propanediol dicarbamates felbamate and meprobamate |journal=J.

It has been shown that meprobamate has the ability to activate currents even in the absence of GABA.<ref name="pmid9067327"/>  This relatively unique property makes meprobamate exceptionally dangerous when used in combination with other GABA-mediated drugs (including alcohol). It is also a potent [[adenosine reuptake inhibitor]] (AdoRI),<ref name="pmid6468504">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0014-2999(84)90174-2 |vauthors=Phillis JW, Delong RE | title = A purinergic component in the central actions of meprobamate | journal = Eur J Pharmacol. | volume = 101 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 295–297 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6468504 }}</ref><ref name="pmid4085561">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0014-2999(85)90149-9 |vauthors=DeLong RE, Phillis JW, Barraco RA | title = A possible role of endogenous adenosine in the sedative action of meprobamate | journal = Eur J Pharmacol. | volume = 118 | issue = 3 | pages = 359–362 | year = 1985 | pmid = 4085561 }}</ref>

==Indications==
Meprobamate is licensed for the short-term relief of anxiety, although it is not known whether the purported anti-anxiety effects of meprobamate are separable from its sedative effects. Its effectiveness as a selective agent for the treatment of anxiety has not been proven in humans,<ref>{{Cite book

Meprobamate is available in 200&nbsp;mg and 400&nbsp;mg tablets for oral administration. Meprobamate is also a component of the combination drug [[Equagesic]] (discontinued in the UK in 2002) acting as a [[muscle relaxant]].

Meprobamate, like barbiturates, possesses an analgesic/anesthetic potential. It is also found as a component of the combination analgesic "Stopayne" capsules (along with [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen), [[caffeine]], and [[codeine]] phosphate).

==Overdose==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}
Symptoms of meprobamate overdose include: drowsiness, sluggishness, unresponsiveness, or coma; loss of muscle control; severe impairment or cessation of breathing; or shock. Death has been reported with ingestion of as little as 12 g of meprobamate and survival with as much as 40 g. In an overdose, meprobamate tablets may form a gastric [[bezoar]], requiring physical removal of the undissolved mass of tablets through an endoscope; therefore, administration of [[Charcodote|activated charcoal]] should be considered even after 4 or more hours or if levels are rising.

Preparations which contain [[paracetamol]] may also induce severe liver toxicity resulting from paracetamol poisoning. The exact form of the preparation used should be identified immediately if possible, as patients who have also overdosed on paracetamol can reduce/avoid permanent liver damage with the administration of [[acetylcysteine]].

Meprobamate overdosage is still a continuing problem.<ref>[Medical Toxicology - Page 897 - Google Books Result Richard C. Dart - 2004 - Medical Meprobamate overdosage: a continuing 93. problem, din Toxicol 1977;11(5):501-515. 58. Frcund LCi. .... Sweetman S. Martindale: the complete drug reference. https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0781728452]</ref>

==Health issues==
Meprobamate is a [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Schedules of Controlled Substances|Schedule IV]] drug (US) (S5 in South Africa) under the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]].  With protracted use it can cause physical dependence and a potentially life-threatening abstinence syndrome similar to that of [[barbiturates]] and [[alcohol]] ([[delerium tremens]]). For this reason, discontinuation is often achieved through an extended regimen of slowly decreasing doses over a period of weeks, or even months. Alternatively, the patient may be switched to a longer-acting [[GABA agonist|gabaergic]] agent such as [[diazepam]] (in a manner similar to the use of methadone therapy for opiate addiction) before attempting de-titration.

An acute [[cerebral edema]] caused by a reaction to [[Equagesic]], a combination of [[aspirin]] and meprobamate, is believed to have caused the death of [[Bruce Lee]].

"In the January 2008 issue of Drug Safety Update, a Stop press article announced the recent European review of carisoprodol for which the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the risks of treatment outweigh the benefits. This review was triggered by concerns from the Norwegian Medical Agency that carisoprodol (converted to meprobamate after administration) was associated with increased risk of abuse, addiction, intoxication, and psychomotor impairment."  February 2008.<ref>Carisoprodol and meprobamate: risks outweigh benefits.  Article date: February 2008. http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Safetyinformation/DrugSafetyUpdate/CON084737</ref>

European Medicines Agency recommended suspension of marketing authorisations for meprobamate-containing medicines in the European Union in January 2012.
