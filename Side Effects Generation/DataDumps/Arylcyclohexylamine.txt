'''Arylcyclohexylamines''', also known as '''arylcyclohexamines''' or '''arylcyclohexanamines''', are a [[chemical class]] of [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]], [[designer drug|designer]], and [[experimental drug]]s.

== History ==
[[Phencyclidine]] (PCP) is believed to be the first arylcyclohexylamine with recognized anesthetic properties, but several arylcyclohexylamines were described before PCP in the scientific literature, beginning with PCA (1-phenylcyclohexan-1-amine) the synthesis of which was first published in 1907. [[Eticyclidine|PCE]] was reported in 1953 and PCMo in 1954, with the latter compound described as a potent sedative.<ref name=Morris>{{cite journal|first1=H.|last1=Morris|first2=J.|last2=Wallach|title=From PCP to MXE: a comprehensive review of the non-medical use of dissociative drugs|journal=Drug Testing and Analysis|year=2014|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dta.1620/abstract|doi=10.1002/dta.1620|pmid=24678061|volume=6|issue=7–8|pages=614–32}}</ref> Arylcyclohexylamines anesthetics were intensively investigated at [[Parke-Davis]], beginning with the 1956 synthesis of [[phencyclidine]] and later the related compound [[ketamine]].<ref name="Morris"/> The 1970s saw the debut of these compounds, especially PCP and its [[structural analog|analogues]], as illicitly used [[recreational drugs]] due to their [[dissociative]] [[hallucinogen]]ic and [[euphoriant]] effects. Since, the class has been expanded by [[scientific research]] into [[stimulant]], [[analgesic]], and [[neuroprotective]] agents, and also by [[:wikt:clandestine|clandestine]] [[chemist]]s in search of novel [[recreational drug]]s.

== Structure ==
[[Image:acha markush.png|120px|thumb|General structure of arylcyclohexylamines]]
An arylcyclohexylamine is composed of a [[cyclohexylamine]] unit with an [[aryl]] [[Moiety (chemistry)|moiety]] attachment. The aryl group is positioned [[geminal]] to the [[amine]]. In the simplest cases, the aryl moiety is typically a [[phenyl ring]], sometimes with additional substitution. The amine is usually not primary, secondary amines such as methylamino or ethylamino, or tertiary cycloalkylamines such as [[piperidine|piperidino]] and [[pyrrolidine|pyrrolidino]], are the most commonly encountered N-substituents.

Antagonism of the NMDA receptor confers anesthetic, anticonvulsant, neuroprotective, and dissociative effects; blockade of the [[dopamine transporter]] mediates stimulant and euphoriant effects as well as [[psychosis]] in high amounts; and activation of the μ-opioid receptor causes analgesic and euphoriant effects. Stimulation of the σ and D<sub>2</sub> receptors may also contribute to hallucinogenic and psychomimetic effects.<ref name="pmid15852061"/>

Versatile agents with a wide range of possible pharmacological activities depending on the extent and range to which chemical modifications are implemented.

* Other cycloalkane ring sizes have been experimented with than just purely thinking in terms of the cyclohexylamine. The requisite cycloalkylketone is reacted with PhMgBr; 3° alcohol is then reacted with NaN<sub>3</sub>; azide then reduced with LAH.
