'''4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxy-1-benzylpiperazine''' ('''2C-B-BZP''') is a [[psychoactive drug]] and [[research chemical]] of the [[piperazine]] [[chemical class]] which has been sold as a "[[designer drug]]".<ref name="pmid19345524">{{cite journal |vauthors=Westphal F, Junge T, Girreser U, Stobbe S, Pérez SB |title=Structure elucidation of a new designer benzylpiperazine: 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxybenzylpiperazine |journal=Forensic Science International |volume=187 |issue=1-3 |pages=87–96 |date=May 2009 |pmid=19345524 |doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2009.03.003 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid20814349">{{cite journal |vauthors=Peters FT, Martinez-Ramirez JA |title=Analytical toxicology of emerging drugs of abuse |journal=Therapeutic Drug Monitoring |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=532–9 |date=October 2010 |pmid=20814349 |doi=10.1097/FTD.0b013e3181f33411 |url=}}</ref> It produces [[stimulant]] effects similar to those of [[benzylpiperazine]] (BZP).

== Chemistry ==

2C-B-BZP contains a benzylpiperazine base as well as the ring-substitution pattern of the [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] [[phenethylamine]] [[2C-B]]. 2C-B-BZP is not a phenethylamine itself and does not produce psychedelic effects, as the binding groups are in the wrong position to activate the [[5-HT2A|5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor]], while 2C-B-phenylpiperazine substitutes for DOM in DOM-trained rats with around 1/10th the potency of DOM, but does not substitute for TFMPP.<ref name="Trachsel">{{cite book |author=Daniel Trachsel |author2=David Lehmann |author3=Christoph Enzensperger |last-author-amp=yes |year=2013 |title=Phenethylamine: Von der Struktur zur Funktion |publisher=Nachtschatten Verlag AG |isbn=978-3-03788-700-4}}</ref>{{rp|867–868}}

== Effects ==

2C-B-BZP produces stimulant effects which last 3–6 hours. It is also said by several sources to increase the effects of other compounds when combined {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}. Side effects include headaches and nausea, similar to those of other recreationally-used piperazine derivatives.

== Legality ==

2C-B-BZP is unscheduled and uncontrolled in the [[United States]], but possession and sale of 2C-B-BZP could possibly be prosecuted under the [[Federal Analog Act]] because of its structural similarities to benzylpiperazine. 2C-B-BZP is illegal to possess, use or sell in [[Japan]] where it used to be sold in local [[smartshop]]s.
