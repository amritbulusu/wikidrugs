'''Perindopril''' is a long-acting [[ACE inhibitor]] used to treat [[high blood pressure]], heart failure, or stable [[coronary artery disease]]<ref>{{cite web

According to the Australian government's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme website, based on data provided to the Australian Department of Health and Aging by the manufacturer, perindopril arginine and perindopril erbumine are therapeutically equivalent and may be interchanged without differences in clinical effect.<ref>{{cite web

==Medical uses==
Perindopril shares the indications of ACE inhibitors as a class, including essential [[hypertension]], stable coronary artery disease (reduction of risk of cardiac events in patients with a history of [[myocardial infarction]] and/or revascularization) and treatment of symptomatic heart disease or failure. In addition, the Perindopril pROtection aGainst REcurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS) found that perindopril reduces the risk of [[stroke]] in both hypertensive and nonhypertensive individuals with a history of stroke or [[transient ischemic attack]].<ref name="PROGRESS">{{cite journal|title=Randomised trial of a perindopril-based blood-pressure-lowering regimen among 6,105 individuals with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack|author=PROGRESS Collaborative Group|journal=The Lancet|series=2001 Sep 29;|volume=358|issue=9287|pages=1033–1041|pmid=11589932|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(01)06178-5}}</ref>

The Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial showed the benefits of taking the two drugs perindopril and [[amlodipine]] together. About 9000 British patients aged 40 to 79 were involved in the five-year trial. Half were given the new drug combination; the rest were given traditional drugs. Perindopril and amlodipine were found to be so effective, the trial was stopped early so all patients could receive the combination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jadn.co.uk/w/CoversylAmlodipineForHighBloodPressure.htm|title=What you need to know about the new wonder drug cocktail for high blood pressure...|work=JADN Repository|year=2005|author=Charlotte Harding|accessdate=2007-07-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/451914|title=ASCOT: Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial -- Results From The Lipid-Lowering Arm|work=Medscape Today|author=Linda Brookes|year=2003|accessdate=2007-07-01}}</ref>

==Composition==
Each tablet contains 2, 4, or 8&nbsp;mg of the tert-butylamine salt of perindopril.  Perindopril is also available under the trade name [[Coversyl Plus]], containing 4&nbsp;mg of perindopril combined with 1.25&nbsp;mg [[indapamide]].

In Australia, each tablet contains 2.5, 5, or 10&nbsp;mg of perindopril arginine. Perindopril is also available under the trade name Coversyl Plus, containing 5&nbsp;mg of perindopril arginine combined with 1.25&nbsp;mg indapamide and [[Coversyl Plus LD]], containing 2.5&nbsp;mg of perindopril arginine combined with 0.625&nbsp;mg indapamide.

The efficacy and tolerability of a fixed-dose combination of 4&nbsp;mg perindopril and 5&nbsp;mg [[amlodipine]], a calcium channel antagonist, has been confirmed in a prospective, observational multicenter trial of 1,250 hypertensive patients.<ref name="test">Bahl VK, Jadhav UM, Thacker HP. Management of Hypertension with the Fixed Combination of Perindopril and Amlodipine in Daily Clinical Practice: Results from the STRONG Prospective, Observational, Multicenter Study. ''American Journal of Cardiovascular Drugs'' May 22, 2009; '''9''' (3): 135-42 [http://adisonline.com/cardiovascular/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2009&issue=09030&article=00001&type=abstract Link text]</ref> A preparation of the two drugs is available commercially as Coveram.

==Trade names==
Also, it is available under the brand names:

*Acertil
*Actiprex
*Armix
*Coverene
*Coverex
*Coversum
*Coversyl
*Covinace
*Perineva
*Prenessa
*Prestarium
*Preterax
*Prexanil
*Prexum
*Procaptan
*Provinace
*Pericard
*Percarnil

==Contraindications==
*Children
*Pregnancy
*Lactation
*Situations where a patient has a history of hypersensitivity 
*Renal failure

==Precautions==
*Assess [[kidneys|renal]] function before and during treatment where appropriate.
*[[Renovascular hypertension]]
*Surgery/anesthesia
*Renal failure: the dose should be cautiously adjusted in accordance with the creatinine clearance (refer to complete data sheet). 
*Symptomatic hypotension is rarely seen, but is more likely in volume-depleted patients, those receiving [[diuretic]]s, or with the first two doses. In diuretic-treated patients, stop the diuretic three days before starting perindopril. A diuretic may later be given in combination if necessary; potassium-sparing diuretics are not recommended. Combination with neuroleptics or imipramine-type drugs may increase the hypotensive effect. Serum lithium concentrations may rise during lithium therapy.

==Side effects==
Side effects are mild, usually at the start of treatment; they include:
*Cough
*Fatigue
*Weakness/[[Asthenia]]
*Headache
*Disturbances of mood and/or sleep

Less often
*Taste impairment
*[[Epigastric]] discomfort
*Nausea
*Abdominal pain
*Rash

Reversible increases in blood [[urea]] and [[creatinine]] may be observed. [[Proteinuria]] has occurred in some patients. Rarely, angioneurotic [[edema]] and decreases in [[hemoglobin]], red cells, and [[platelets]] have been reported.

==Marketing==
On 9 July 2014, the [[European Commission]] imposed fines of €427,700,000 on [[Laboratoires Servier]] and 5 companies which produce generics due to Servier's abuse of their dominant market position, in breach of [[European Union]] Competition law. Servier's strategy had included acquiring the principal source of generic production of Perindopril and entering into several pay-for-delay agreements with potential generic competitors.<ref>http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-799_en.htm</ref>
