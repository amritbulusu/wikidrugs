'''''para''-Methoxyphenylpiperazine''' ('''MeOPP''', '''pMPP''', '''4-MPP'''; '''Paraperazine''') is a [[piperazine]] derivative with [[stimulant]] effects which has been sold as an ingredient in "[[Party pills]]", initially in [[New Zealand]] and subsequently in other countries around the world.

==Pharmacology==
MeOPP is anecdotally said to induce significantly less anxiety than similar piperazines, and is usually taken at doses between 120–200&nbsp;mg. It does not produce prominent stimulant effects, but is instead said to be relaxing,{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} however it is often mixed with stimulant piperazine derivatives such as [[benzylpiperazine]] (BZP) for a combined effect.

MeOPP has been found ''in vitro'' to [[reuptake inhibitor|inhibit]] the [[reuptake]] and induce the [[releasing agent|release]] of the [[monoamine]] [[neurotransmitter]]s. This is a mechanism of action shared with drugs of abuse such as [[amphetamines]], and MeOPP produces somewhat similar effects although it is much less potent and is thought to have relatively insignificant abuse potential.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Nagai | first1 = F | last2 = Nonaka | first2 = R | last3 = Satoh Hisashi | first3 = Kamimura K | year = 2006 | title = The effects of non-medically used psychoactive drugs on monoamine neurotransmission in rat brain | url = | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 559| issue = | pages = 132–137| doi=10.1016/j.ejphar.2006.11.075 | pmid=17223101}}</ref> Piperazine derivatives such as [[trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine]] (TFMPP) have also been shown to exert a major part of their mechanism of action as nonselective [[serotonin receptor agonist]]s, and MeOPP has also been demonstrated to act in this way.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Maurer | first1 = HH | last2 = Kraemer | first2 = T | last3 = Springer | first3 = D | last4 = Staack | first4 = RF | date = Apr 2004 | title = Chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology, and hepatic metabolism of designer drugs of the amphetamine (ecstasy), piperazine, and pyrrolidinophenone types: a synopsis | url = | journal = Therapeutic Drug Monitoring | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 127–31 | doi=10.1097/00007691-200404000-00007 | pmid=15228152}}</ref>

==Legal status==

===New Zealand===
Based on the recommendation of the EACD, the New Zealand government has passed legislation which placed BZP, along with a number of other piperazine derivatives into Class C of the New Zealand Misuse of Drugs Act 1975. A ban was intended to come into effect in New Zealand on December 18, 2007, but the law change did not go through until the following year, and the sale of BZP and the other listed piperazines became illegal in New Zealand as of 1 April 2008. An amnesty for possession and usage of these drugs remained until October 2008, at which point they became completely illegal.<ref>[http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/PB/Legislation/Bills/d/3/d/00DBHOH_BILL8220_1-Misuse-of-Drugs-Classification-of-BZP-Amendment.htm Misuse of Drugs (Classification of BZP) Amendment Bill 2008]</ref>

===United States===
MeOPP is not scheduled at the federal level in the [[United States]].<ref name="PART 1308 — SCHEDULES OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES - 1308.11 Schedule I">[http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1308/1308_11.htm 21 CFR — SCHEDULES OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES §1308.11 Schedule I.]</ref>

====Florida====
"Methoxyphenylpiperazine" is a Schedule I [[controlled substance]] in the state of [[Florida]] making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess in Florida.<ref name="Florida Statutes - Chapter 893 - DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION AND CONTROL">[http://leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0800-0899/0893/0893.html Florida Statutes - Chapter 893 - DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION AND CONTROL]</ref>
