Hydromorphinol was developed in Austria in 1932.  It is available, and commonly used, as a medicine in Sweden. In the [[United States]], it was never available and is classified as a Schedule I drug with a DEA [[ACSCN]] of 9301.  The salts in use are the bitartrate (free base conversion ratio 0.643) and hydrochloride (0.770).  The 2014 national aggregate manufacturing quota was 2 grams, unchanged from prior years. <ref>http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/quotas/2014/fr0825.htm</ref>

Hydromorphinol is metabolised mainly in the liver in the same fashion as many other opioids and is itself a minor active metabolite of [[14-Hydroxydihydrocodeine]], an uncommonly used opiate (but is therefore also an active metabolite of a first-order active metabolite of [[oxycodone]]).

It is distributed under the trade name Numorphan in some countries.  It is controlled under the Single Convention On Narcotic Drugs.
