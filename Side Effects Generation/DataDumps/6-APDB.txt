'''6-(2-Aminopropyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran''' ('''6-APDB''', '''4-Desoxy-MDA''', '''EMA-3''') is a [[stimulant]] and [[entactogen]] [[drug]] of the [[substituted phenethylamine|phenethylamine]] and [[substituted amphetamine|amphetamine]] classes.<ref name="pmid8246240">{{cite journal | vauthors = Monte AP, Marona-Lewicka D, Cozzi NV, Nichols DE | title = Synthesis and pharmacological examination of benzofuran, indan, and tetralin analogues of 3,4-(methylenedioxy)amphetamine | journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 36 | issue = 23 | pages = 3700â€“6 |date=November 1993 | pmid = 8246240 | doi = 10.1021/jm00075a027| url = }}</ref> It is an [[structural analog|analogue]] of [[3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine|MDA]] where the [[heterocyclic]] 4-position [[oxygen]] from the 3,4-[[methylenedioxy]] [[functional group|ring]] has been replaced with a [[methylene bridge]].<ref name="pmid8246240"/> [[5-APDB]] (3-Desoxy-MDA) is an analogue of 6-APDB where the 3-position oxygen has been replaced with a methylene instead.<ref name="pmid8246240"/> 6-APDB, along with 5-APDB, was first [[Organic synthesis|synthesized]] by [[David E. Nichols]] in the early 1990s while investigating non-[[neurotoxic]] [[3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine|MDMA]] [[structural analog|analogue]]s.<ref name="pmid8246240"/>

In animal studies, 6-APDB fully substitutes for [[N-methyl-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)butan-2-amine|MBDB]] and [[5-methoxy-6-methyl-2-aminoindane|MMAI]] but not for [[amphetamine]] or [[LSD]].<ref name="pmid8246240"/> ''[[In vitro]]'', 6-APDB has been shown to [[reuptake inhibitor|inhibit]] the [[reuptake]] of [[serotonin]], [[dopamine]], and [[norepinephrine]] with [[IC50|IC<sub>50</sub>]] values of 322 nM, 1,997 nM, and 980 nM, respectively.<ref name="pmid8246240"/> These values are very similar to those of MDA, but with those for the [[catecholamine]]s slightly lower in comparison, perhaps more similarly to MDMA.<ref name="pmid8246240"/> In contrast, 5-APDB is highly selective for serotonin.<ref name="pmid8246240"/> Though 6-APDB does not substitute for amphetamine in rats at the doses used in referenced study, based on its ''in vitro'' profile it can be suggested that it may have amphetamine-like effects at higher doses.

The unsaturated benzofuran derivative [[6-APB]], or 6-(2-aminopropyl)benzofuran is also known, but the difference in pharmacological effects between 6-APB and 6-APDB is unclear.

6-APDB is a class B drug in the UK since June 10, 2013. It is banned by a blanket law on benzofurans and related compounds.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2014/9780111110904 | title = The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Ketamine etc.) (Amendment) Order 2014 | accessdate = 2014-03-11 | author = UK Home Office | date = 2014-03-05 | publisher = UK Government}}</ref>
