'''Benfluorex''' is an [[anorectic]] and [[hypolipidemic agent]] that is structurally related to [[fenfluramine]] patented and manufactured by a French pharmaceutical company [[Servier]]. Two clinical studies have shown it may improve [[glycemic control]] and decrease [[insulin resistance]] in people with poorly controlled [[diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]].<ref>{{ cite journal | author1 = Moulin, P. | author2 = Andre, M. | author3 = Alawi, H. | last4 = dos Santos | first4 = L.

On 18 December 2009, the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) recommended the withdrawal of all medicines containing benfluorex in the [[European Union]], because their risks, particularly the risk of [[heart valve disease]] (fenfluramine-like cardiovascular side-effects), are greater than their benefits.<ref>{{ cite web | title = European Medicines Agency recommends withdrawal of benfluorex from the market in European Union | url = http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/referral/benfluorex/Benfluorex_81503309en.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = European Medicines Agency | date = 2009-12-18 }}</ref> Thus Frachon ''et al.'' showed a significantly higher prevalence of unexplained valvular [[cardiovascular disease|heart disease]] in patients taking benfluorex compared to controls.<ref>{{Cite journal

In France the medication had been marketed as by Servier as an adjuvant [[anti-diabetic drug|antidiabetic]] under the name '''Mediator'''. The drug was on the market between 1976 and 2009 and is thought to have caused between 500 – 2,000 deaths.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12155639 | title = France braced for diabetic drug scandal report | publisher = BBC News | date = 2011-01-11 }}</ref> The drug was also used in Spain (trade name, '''Modulator'''), Portugal and Cyprus.

Fenfluramine, a related drug, had been withdrawn from the market in 1997 after reports of [[heart valve]] disease,<ref name="pmid9271479">{{ cite journal | author1 = Connolly, H.

This side effect is mediated by the metabolite [[norfenfluramine]] on [[5-HT2B receptor|5HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor]]s of heart valves (Rothman et al., Circulation 2000), leading to a characteristic pattern of heart failure following proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts on the [[tricuspid valve]]. Both fenfluramine and benfluorex form norfenfluramine as a metabolite. This side effect led to the withdrawal of fenfluramine as an anorectic drug worldwide, and later to the withdrawal of benfluorex in Europe.
