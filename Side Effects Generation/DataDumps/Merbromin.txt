'''Merbromin''' (marketed as '''Mercurochrome''', '''Merbromine''', '''Sodium mercurescein''', '''Asceptichrome''', '''Supercrome''', '''Brocasept''' and '''Cinfacromin''') is a [[topical]] [[antiseptic]] used for minor cuts and scrapes. Merbromin is an [[organomercury|organomercuric]] disodium salt [[Chemical compound|compound]] and a [[fluorescein]]. It is readily available in most countries but, because of its [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] content, it is no longer sold in Switzerland, France, Germany, and the United States.<ref name="us"/><ref name="de"/><ref name="fr"/>

==Uses==
Merbromin's best-known use is as a topical antiseptic to treat minor wounds, burns, and scratches.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prospecto autorizado Mercromina Film ®|url=http://www.aemps.es/cima/especialidad.do?metodo=verFichaWordPdf&codigo=49319&formato=pdf&formulario=PROSPECTOS&file=prospecto.pdf|accessdate=15 May 2013}}</ref> It is also used in the antisepsis of the umbilical cord<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sellares Casas|first1=E|title=Eficacia de una aplicación frente a 3 de merbromina en el tiempo de caída del cordón|journal=Acta pediátrica Española|volume=60|issue=9|accessdate=2002|display-authors=etal}}</ref> and the antisepsis of wound of difficult scar formation, like neuropathic ulcers, and diabetic foot sores.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gaitan Enríquez|first1=J|title=Merbromina como tratamiento de elección en úlceras de pie diabético|journal=Clínica rural|date=September 1997|volume=497|quote=Se ha estudiado en 72 pacientes la eficacia de la merbromina comparativamente con la clorhexidina como antisépticos usados en la curación de múltiples afecciones en el pie diabético. Con el uso de merbromina se consigue disminuir apreciablemente el tiempo de cicatrización de las heridas, y se ha observado también una ausencia de complicaciones en los casos estudiados.}}</ref> When applied on a wound, it stains the skin a distinctive [[carmine|carmine red]], which can last up to 2 weeks through repeated washings. It is useful on infections of the finger or toe nails because of its permanence, and lethality to bacteria. It was known in many households as "monkey blood".<ref>http://www.retroist.com/2013/08/19/monkeys-blood-for-those-boo-boos/</ref>

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1998 classified merbromin as "not Generally Recognized as Safe" together with a multitude of other active compounds, based on the absence of interest on the part of pharmaceutical companies in funding new studies or updated supporting information, due to the high costs of said studies in comparison to sales, rather than due to being toxic.<ref>{{cite web|title=Status of Certain Additional Over-the-Counter Drug Category II and III Active Ingredients|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/search?conditions%5Bterm%5D=63+fr+19799|ref=21 CFR part 310, 63 FR 19799}}</ref>

In the United States, its use has been superseded by other agents (''e.g.'', [[povidone iodine]], [[benzalkonium chloride]], [[chloroxylenol]]{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}). In Canada, [[Jean Coutu]]/Personnelle brand sells as "mercurochrome" what is actually [[chlorhexidine]].  Mercurochrome is still an important antiseptic, particularly in developing nations, due to its “unbelievably low cost.”<ref name=Mohite>{{cite journal | title = Mercurochrome 1% as an Antiseptic for Burns: Economical - but is it Efficacious and Safe? |author1=Mohite, P.

Merbromin is also used as a biological dye to mark tissue margins and as a metal dye in industrial [[dye penetrant inspection]] to detect metal fractures.

==Synthesis==
Merbromin is synthesized by combining dibromofluorescein with mercuric acetate and sodium hydroxide or alternatively, through action of the mercuric acetate upon or (combining with) sodium dibromofluorescein.   Because of its anionic character, it is chemically incompatible with acids, the majority of alkaloid salts and most local anesthetics.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Budavary|editor1-first=Susan|title=The Merck Index, An Encyclopedia of Chemicals, Drugs, and Biologicals|date=1989|publisher=Merck & Co|location=Rahway, New Jersey, USA.|isbn=091191028X|edition=11}}</ref>

==Mercurochrome==
Mercurochrome is a trade name of merbromin.  The name is also commonly used for [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] antiseptic [[solution]]s consisting of merbromin (typically at 2% concentration) dissolved in either [[ethanol|ethyl alcohol]] ([[tincture]]) or water ([[aqueous solution|aqueous]]). Despite the name, the compound contains no [[chromium]].

Its antiseptic qualities were discovered by [[Hugh H. Young]] in 1918, while working at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] as a [[physician]].<ref name=Wilner>{{cite book | author = Wilner, I. | title = The Man Time Forgot: A Tale of Genius, Betrayal, and the Creation of Time Magazine | page = 230 | year = 2006 | publisher = Harper Collins | isbn = 0-06-050549-4 }}</ref> The chemical soon became popular among parents and physicians for everyday antiseptic uses, and it was commonly used for minor injuries in the schoolyard.

The United States [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) moved it from the “generally recognized as safe” classification into the “untested” classification to effectively halt its distribution in the United States on {{#dateformat:October 19, 1998}} over fears of potential [[mercury poisoning]].<ref name="us">{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Legislation/FederalFoodDrugandCosmeticActFDCAct/SignificantAmendmentstotheFDCAct/FDAMA/ucm100219.htm | work = Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) | title = Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis of Mercury Compounds in the List | publisher = [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] | date = 2009-04-30 }}</ref> Sales were halted in Germany in 2003,<ref name="de">[[:de:Merbromin]]</ref> and in France in 2006.<ref name="fr">[[:fr:Merbromine]]</ref>  It is readily available in most other countries.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Within the United States, products such as Humco Mercuroclear play on the brand recognition history of Mercurochrome, but substitute other ingredients with similar properties (Mercuroclear: "Aqueous solution of benzalkonium chloride and lidocaine hydrochloride").<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.humco.com/_pdfs/data-sheets/1637-Mercuroclear.pdf |format = pdf | title = Mercuroclear MSDS | publisher = Humco }}</ref>
