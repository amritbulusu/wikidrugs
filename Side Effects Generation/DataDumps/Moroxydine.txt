It was reported in March 2014 that three [[kindergarten]]s in two [[provinces of China]] had been found to be secretly dosing their students with moroxydine hydrochloride to try to prevent them from becoming ill. The kindergartens are paid only for the days that pupils attend and wanted to ensure that they maximised their earnings.<ref>{{cite news|last=Moore|first=Malcolm|title=China: All children to be given drug tests after schools caught medicating pupils|url=http://www.theage.com.au/world/china-all-children-to-be-given-drug-tests-after-schools-caught-medicating-pupils-20140320-hvkpf.html|accessdate=2014-03-20|newspaper=The Age|date=2014-03-20}}</ref>
