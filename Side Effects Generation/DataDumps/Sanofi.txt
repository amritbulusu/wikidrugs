===Sanofi-Synthélabo===
Sanofi was founded in 1973<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lexpansion.lexpress.fr/entreprises/le-fondateur-de-sanofi-est-mort_1366122.html|title=Le fondateur de Sanofi est mort|work=lexpress.fr|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref> as a subsidiary of [[Elf Aquitaine]] (a French oil company subsequently acquired by [[Total S.A.|Total]]), when Elf Aquitaine took control of the Labaz group, a pharmaceutical company.

[[Synthélabo]] was founded in 1970 through the merger of two French pharmaceutical laboratories, Laboratoires Dausse (founded in 1834) and Laboratoires Robert & Carrière (founded in 1899).

===Aventis===
[[File:Aventis logo.png|left]]

Aventis was formed in 1999 when French company [[Rhône-Poulenc]] S.A. merged with the German corporation [[Hoechst Marion Roussel]], which itself was formed from the 1995 merger of [[Hoechst AG]] with [[Cassella]], [[Roussel Uclaf]] and [[Marion Merrell Dow]].

====Sanofi-Aventis merger====
Sanofi-Aventis was formed in 2004 when Sanofi-Synthélabo acquired Aventis. In early 2004, Sanofi-Synthélabo made a [[Takeover|hostile takeover]] bid worth €47.8 billion for Aventis. Initially, Aventis rejected the bid because it felt that the bid offered inferior value based on the company's share value, and the board of Aventis went so far as to enact [[Shareholder rights plan|poison pill]] provisions and to invite [[Novartis]] to enter merger negotiations.<ref>Heather Timmons for the New York Times. 3 April 2004 [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/03/business/international-business-aventis-invites-novartis-to-counter-sanofi-s-bid.html Aventis Invites Novartis To Counter Sanofi's Bid]</ref> The three-month takeover battle concluded when Sanofi-Synthélabo launched a friendly bid of €54.5 billion in place of the previously rejected hostile bid.  The [[France|French]] government played a strong role, desiring what it called a "local solution", by putting heavy pressure on Sanofi-Synthélabo to raise its bid for Aventis and for Aventis to accept the offer<ref>Heather Timmons for the New York Times. 27 April 2004 [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/27/business/france-helped-broker-the-aventis-sanofi-deal.html France Helped Broker the Aventis-Sanofi Deal]</ref> and by rejecting Aventis' poison pill proposal.<ref>New York Times 24 April 2004 [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/24/business/aventis-plan-is-rejected.html Aventis Plan Is Rejected]</ref>  One of the largest risks in the deal for both sides, was the fate of the patents protecting [[Clopidogrel]] (Plavix) which was one of the top-selling drugs in the world at the time and the major source of Sanofi's revenue.<ref>Kimberly S Cleaves and Ann M Thayer [http://pubs.acs.org/subscribe/archive/mdd/v07/i08/pdf/804business2.pdf Warning, merge with care: Sanoﬁ-Aventis] Modern Drug Discovery, August 2004:21-26</ref>

In 2007 Sanofi-Aventis expanded on Aventis' prior relationship with [[Regeneron]]; in the new deal Sanofi-Aventis agreed to pay Regeneron $100 million each year for five years, under which Regeneron would use its [[monoclonal antibody]] [[drug discovery|discovery]] platform to create new [[biopharmaceuticals]], which Sanofi-Aventis gained the exclusive right to co-develop.<ref name=RegenExpand>Ron Winslow for the Wall Street Journal. 10 Nov. 2009 [https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703808904574528224003357650 Sanofi Expands Regeneron Deal]</ref>  In 2009 the companies expanded the deal to $160 million per year and extended it through 2017.<ref name=RegenExpand/><ref name=GEN2009>Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News. 11 Nov 2009 [http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/sanofi-aventis-commits-over-2-8b-to-regeneron-in-mab-discovery-alliance/68174500/ Sanofi-Aventis Commits Over $2.8B to Regeneron in mAb Discovery Alliance]</ref>  As of 2009 the collaboration had four antibodies in clinical development and had filed an IND for a fifth.

==Rename to Sanofi and beyond==

The company dropped the -Aventis suffix of its name on 6 May 2011 after receiving approval at its [[annual general meeting]]. The reason given by the company for the change was to make its name easier to pronounce in countries such as China.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mennella|first=Noelle|title=Sanofi changes name, pace of acquisitions to slow|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/06/sanofi-idUSLDE74521Z20110506|accessdate=7 May 2011|date=6 May 2011|agency=[[Reuters]]}}</ref>

In January 2012, Sanofi co-invested in the $125 million [[Series A round|Series A financing]] of Warp Drive Bio.  Sanofi sought support for its internal cancer research program and also took on an obligation to acquire Warp Drive if certain milestones were met.<ref>Arlene Weintraub for Xconomy.  10 January 2012 [http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2012/01/10/warp-drive-bio-launches-with-125m-from-third-rock-greylock-sanofi/?single_page=true Warp Drive Bio Launches With $125M from Third Rock, Greylock, Sanofi]</ref>

In January 2014, Genzyme and [[Alnylam Pharmaceuticals]], a US biotechnology company developing [[RNAi]] therapeutics, announced that Genyzme would invest $700 million in Alnylam.  Under the deal, Genzyme obtained further rights to patisiran, an RNAi treatment for [[transthyretin]]-mediated [[amyloidosis]] - a condition that can result in [[familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy]] and [[familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy]],<ref>Alnylam, [http://www.alnylam.com/product-pipeline/ttr-amyloidosis-fap/ TTR Amyloidosis (FAP)]</ref> and obtained rights to other compounds in Alnylam's pipeline.<ref>Chad Bray for the New York Times' Dealbook. 13 January 2014 [https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/13/sanofi-unit-to-buy-700-million-stake-in-rare-disease-company/ Sanofi Unit to Buy $700 Million Stake in Rare Disease Company]</ref>

In March 2014 Sanofi joined the bidding for Merck & Co.’s over-the-counter health-products unit, the maker of [[Coppertone (sunscreen)|Coppertone]] sunblock and [[Pseudoephedrine/loratadine|Claritin]] allergy medicine; bids were expected to range between $10 billion and $12 billion.<ref>Bloomberg News [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-24/sanofi-said-to-join-bidders-for-merck-s-consumer-health-business.html] 24 March 2014</ref>

In October 2014, Sanofi's directors fired US-resident chief executive Chris Viehbacher, blaming his alleged lack of communication with the board and poor execution of his strategy.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/29/us-sanofi-sa-management-idUSKBN0II0BH20141029  ''French drugmaker Sanofi sacks CEO, shares drop'',  Natalie Huet and Noëlle Mennella, Reuters news agency, New York 29 October 2014].Retrieved: 6 July 2015.</ref>  Board chairperson Serge Weinberg took over as interim CEO until 2 April 2015 when [[Bayer|Bayer Healthcare]] board chairperson [[Olivier Brandicourt]] (appointed by Sanofi on 19 February 2015<ref>[http://en.sanofi.com/NasdaQ_OMX/local/press_releases/sanofi___sanofi_appoints_olivi_1896027_19-02-2015!22_45_00.aspx  ''Sanofi : Sanofi Appoints Olivier Brandicourt as Chief Executive Officer'', Sanofi corporate website, 19 February 2015].Retrieved: 6 July 2015.</ref>) took over.  Before Brandicourt even started his new job, French government ministers [[Stéphane Le Foll]] and [[Ségolène Royal]] attacked the $4.5 million [[golden handshake]] he was getting from Sanofi - and his pay of about $4.7 million a year.<ref>[https://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2015/02/24/french-government-slams-sanofi-over-brandicourt-pay-package/ French Government Slams Sanofi Over Brandicourt Pay Package], ''The Wall Street Journal'', 24 February 2015].Retrieved: 6 July 2015.</ref>

In July 2015, [[Genzyme]] announced it would acquire the rare cancer drug Caprelsa ([[vandetanib]]) from [[AstraZeneca]] for up to $300 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/genzyme-to-buy-caprelsa-from-astrazeneca-for-up-to-300m/81251554/|title=Genzyme to Buy Caprelsa from AstraZeneca for Up to $300M - GEN News Highlights - GEN|publisher=}}</ref> In the same month In July 2015, the company announced a new global collaboration with [[Regeneron]] to discover, develop, and commercialise new immuno-oncology drugs, which could generate more than $2 billion for Regeneron,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/regeneron-sanofi-launch-2b-immuno-oncology-collaboration/81251558/|title=Regeneron, Sanofi Launch $2B+ Immuno-Oncology Collaboration - GEN News Highlights - GEN|publisher=}}</ref> with $640 million upfront, $750 million for proof of concept data and $650 million from the development of [[REGN2810]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/struggling-sanofi-paying-18b-partner-regeneron-immuno-oncology/2015-07-28|title=UPDATED: Struggling Sanofi paying $1.8B to partner with Regeneron on immuno-oncology - FierceBiotech|publisher=}}</ref>

'''Product Recall and Effects''': The Epinephrine auto-injection devices made by Sanofi SA currently on the market in the U.S. and Canada were voluntarily recalled on October 28, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/allerject-epinephrine-auto-injectors-recalled-by-drugmaker-sanofi-1.3293765|title=All Allerject epinephrine auto-injectors recalled|publisher=}}</ref><ref>http://www.allerject.ca/Common/docs/en/Sanofi-Canada-Issues-Voluntary-Recall-of-Allerject.pdf</ref>  The reason stated by Sanofi was that the products have been found to potentially have inaccurate dosage delivery, which may include failure to deliver drug.<ref name="auvi-q.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.auvi-q.com/|title=Auvi-Q® (epinephrine injection, USP)|publisher=}}</ref><ref name="fda.gov">{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm469980.htm|title=Recalls, Market Withdrawals, & Safety Alerts - UPDATED: Sanofi US Issues Voluntary Nationwide Recall of All Auvi-Q® Due to Potential Inaccurate Dosage Delivery|first=Office of Regulatory Affairs, Office of the|last=Commissioner|website=www.fda.gov|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref>

Sanofi US also added the following warning: If a patient experiencing a serious allergic reaction (i.e., anaphylaxis) did not receive the intended dose, there could be significant health consequences, including death because anaphylaxis is a potentially life‑threatening condition.<ref name="auvi-q.com"/>

In its news Release on October 28, 2015, Sanofi Canada stated that it was "actively working with suppliers of alternative epinephrine auto-injectors to have a full stock available in Canada as soon as possible. Canadian customers were asked to immediately return the Allerject product to their local pharmacy to obtain an alternate epinephrine auto-injector."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/sanofi-canada-issues-voluntary-nationwide-recall-of-allerject-due-to-potential-inaccurate-dosage-delivery-538090301.html|title=Sanofi Canada Issues Voluntary Nationwide Recall of Allerject® Due to Potential Inaccurate Dosage|publisher=}}</ref>

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also filed a news release<ref name="fda.gov"/> confirming that the recall involves all Auvi-Q currently on the market in the U.S. The FDA release went on to provide information for consumers re: exchanging the device for another brand of product, also provided on the Auivi-Q web site. Sanofi US will provide reimbursement for out of pocket costs incurred for the purchase of new, alternate epinephrine auto-injectors with proof of purchase.

The alternate products expected to most commonly replace the recalled Sanofi devices are the EpiPens made by [[Mylan]] in the US and by Pfizer—under license from Mylan—in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.epipen101.ca/en/welcome|title=Welcome to EpiPen® 101|publisher=}}</ref> Mylan already had an 85% market share of the auto-injectors in the US<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-23/how-marketing-turned-the-epipen-into-a-billion-dollar-business|title=How Marketing Turned the EpiPen Into a Billion-Dollar Business|first=Cynthia Koons CynthiaLKoons Robert Langreth RobertLangreth|last=Reprints|publisher=}}</ref> in the first half of 2015. Maylan is expected to benefit from the recall by its competitor Sanofi, according to a report published in the Fierce Pharma newsletter of November 2, 2015: ".... it is very hard to see Auvi-Q returning to the market, as it will need to be redesigned and face uphill battle to recapture patient trust after the recall," Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal wrote in a note to clients on Monday.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercepharmamarketing.com/story/sanofis-auvi-q-recall-puts-mylans-rival-epipen-full-control-blockbuster-mar/2015-11-02|title=Sanofi's Auvi-Q recall puts Mylan's rival EpiPen in full control of blockbuster market - FiercePharma|publisher=}}</ref> Gal also believes that the company will eventually have 95% of the Epinephrine auto-injector market, according to another Fierce Pharma report on November 3, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/its-open-season-mylans-epipen-sanofi-teva-stumble/2015-11-02|title=It's open season for Mylan's EpiPen as Sanofi, Teva stumble - FiercePharma|publisher=}}</ref>

In January 2012, Sanofi moved its head office location to 54, [[Rue La Boétie]] in the [[8th arrondissement of Paris]]. This former mansion designed by architect René-Patouillard had previously been the head office of Alcatel-Lucent.

Sanofi's previous head office was located in the [[13th arrondissement of Paris]], 174 Avenue de France.
