== Synthesis ==

The discovery of carbomycin was first reported by Fred W. Tanner Jr. of [[Pfizer]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Carbomycin|journal=The British Medical Journal|date=26 December 1953|volume=2|pages=1421–22|jstor=20313504|issue=4851}}</ref> Carbomycin can be isolated from ''Streptomyces halstedii'' via extraction from a fermentation broth and purified through crystallization from alcohol-water mixtures.<ref name="Wagner1953" /> Carbomycin can be further purified with the use of preparative [[thin-layer chromatography]]. The most efficient solvent is one consisting of ethanol-hexane-water in 90-10-0.15 volume ratio.<ref name=Biosynth>{{cite journal|last=Baghlaf|first=A.O. |author2=A.Z.A Abou-Zeid |author3=A.I. El-Diwzny|title=Biosynthesis of Carbomycin, its Extraction, Purification and Mode of Action on Bacillus subtilis|journal=Journal of Chemical Technology and Biotechnology|year=1981|volume=31|issue=1|pages=241–46|doi=10.1002/jctb.503310133}}</ref>

In the biosynthesis of carbomycin by ''Streptomyces halstedii'', when soybean meal is used to ferment the antibiotic, the addition of several substances can increase the yield of carbomycin. When [[blackstrap molasses]], a carbon source, is added, an increased yield is observed. Nitrogen sources [[ammonium chloride]], [[ammonium nitrate]], and [[ammonium dihydrogen phosphate]] have the same effect on the production of carbomycin. The addition of the organic salts [[sodium acetate]] and [[sodium tartrate]] also increases the yield of the antibiotic.<ref name=Factors>{{cite journal|last=Ghonaim|first=S.A. |author2=A.M. Khalil |author3=A.A. Abou-Zeid|title=Factors affecting fermentative production of magnamycin by Streptomyces halsted II|journal=Agricultural Wastes|date=March 1980|volume=2|issue=1|pages=31–36|doi=10.1016/0141-4607(80)90044-X}}</ref>

Studies of the chemical degradation of carbomycin and comparison of molar activities of [[propionate]]-labeled carbomycins and their degradation products suggest that the [[biosynthesis]] of carbomycin by ''Streptomyces halstedii'' include the synthesis of the [[lactone]] backbone from eight [[acetate]] units and one propionate unit with the branching [[methyl]] group deriving from [[C3 carbon fixation|C-3]] of propionate.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Srinivasan|first=Dorothy|author2=P.R. Srinivasan|title=Studies on the Biosynthesis of Magnamycin|journal=Biochemistry|year=1967|volume=6|issue=10|pages=3111–18|doi=10.1021/bi00862a019}}</ref>

==Medical use==

As carbomycin is not a strong antibiotic, it is not used extensively and is considered a minor antibiotic; it is most effective when used in combination with other drugs.<ref>{{cite book|last=Welch|first=Henry|title=The Antibiotic Saga|year=1960|publisher=The University of Michigan|location=New York|pages=88, 96|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015007092722;view=1up;seq=2}}</ref> The range of activity of carbomycin is similar to that of [[erythromycin]]. In testing the response of 74 strains of bacteria, their susceptibility across carbomycin and [[erythromycin]] was consistent. However, a higher concentration of carbomycin is needed to achieve the same effect as that of erythromycin.<ref name=TBMJ>{{cite journal|journal=The British Medical Journal|year=1953|volume=2|issue=4851|pages=1421–22|doi=10.1038/jid.1954.34|title=The Effect of Washing with Soap and with a Detergent on the 4-Hour Sebaceous Secretion in the Forehead12|last1=Kirk|first1=J E|last2=Effersøe|first2=H}}</ref> The effectiveness of carbomycin as an antibiotic varies. When used to treat 45 patients with pneumonia, carbomycin was as effective as other antibiotics for six patients. Two developed meningitis, while, for twelve patients, it was necessary that the use of carbomycin in treatment be replaced with [[penicillin]].<ref name="TBMJ"/> Carbomycin has been successful in treating neither [[staphylococcal]] [[sepsis]] nor [[bacterial endocarditis]].<ref name="TBMJ"/> In 1954, carbomycin was found to be an effective treatment for [[granuloma inguinale]] by Harry M. Robinson and Morris M. Cohen.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Harry M.|title=Magnamycin in the Treatment of Granuloma Inguinale|journal=Journal of Investigative Dermatology|year=1954|volume=22|issue=4|pages=263–4|pmid=13152395|url=http://www.nature.com/jid/journal/v22/n4/full/jid195436a.html|doi=10.1038/jid.1954.36|last2=Cohen|first2=MM}}</ref>  However, complete healing from the condition depends on the severity and duration of the condition. There were no adverse reactions found to be associated with the use of carbomycin.

==Mode of action==
''[[In vivo]]'' studies have demonstrated that carbomycin stimulates the "accumulation of peptidyl-[[tRNA]] in cells at the nonpermissive temperature" of 40˚C in ''[[E. coli]]'' and thereby inhibits [[protein synthesis]]. Carbomycin is able to inhibit protein synthesis by stimulating the dissociation of peptidyl-tRNA from the ribosome, inhibiting the nascent peptide chain from passing through the exit tunnel and out of the [[ribosome]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Menninger|first=J.R.|author2=D.P. Otto|title=Erythromycin, carbomycin, and spiramycin inhibit protein synthesis by stimulating the dissociation of peptidyl-tRNA from ribosomes|journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy|year=1982|volume=21|issue=5|pages=811–18|pmc=182017|doi=10.1128/AAC.21.5.811|pmid=6179465}}</ref>
