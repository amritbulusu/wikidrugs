In 2006, the large STAR clinical study concluded that [[raloxifene]] is equally effective in reducing the incidence of breast cancer, but after an average 4-year follow-up there were 36% fewer [[uterine cancer]]s and 29% fewer blood clots in women taking raloxifene than in women taking tamoxifen, although the difference was not statistically significant.<ref name="NCI">{{cite web| url = http://www.cancer.gov/star| title = Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR) Trial| accessdate = July 3, 2007| author = National Cancer Institute| date = 2006-04-26| publisher = U.S. National Institutes of Health| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070704091218/http://www.cancer.gov/star| archivedate = July 4, 2007| df = }}</ref><ref name="STAR">{{cite web | url = http://www.nsabp.pitt.edu/STAR/Index.html| title = STAR Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifen | accessdate = July 3, 2007| author = University of Pittsburgh | date = | publisher = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070611194336/http://www.nsabp.pitt.edu/STAR/Index.html |archivedate = June 11, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dslrf.org/breastcancer/content.asp?L2=2&L3=6&SID=130&CID=391&PID=14&CATID=0 | title = Study Finds New Use for Raloxifene: Reducing Breast Cancer in High-Risk Postmenopausal Women | accessdate = March 19, 2009 | author = Dr [[Susan Love]] | date = April 22, 2006 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090802013050/http://www.dslrf.org/breastcancer/content.asp?L2=2&L3=6&SID=130&CID=391&PID=14&CATID=0 | archivedate = August 2, 2009 | df =  }}</ref>

===Infertility===
Tamoxifen is used to treat infertility in women with [[Anovulatory cycle|anovulatory]] disorders. It is given at days 3–7 of a woman's cycle.<ref name="Steiner_2005">{{cite journal | vauthors = Steiner AZ, Terplan M, Paulson RJ | title = Comparison of tamoxifen and clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction: a meta-analysis | journal = Human Reproduction | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 1511–5 | date = Jun 2005 | pmid = 15845599 | doi = 10.1093/humrep/deh840 }}</ref>

Tamoxifen improves fertility in males with infertility by disinhibiting the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (via ER antagonism) and thereby increasing the secretion of [[luteinizing hormone]] and [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] and increasing testicular [[testosterone]] production.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chua|first1=ME|last2=Escusa|first2=KG|last3=Luna|first3=S|last4=Tapia|first4=LC|last5=Dofitas|first5=B|last6=Morales|first6=M|title=Revisiting oestrogen antagonists (clomiphene or tamoxifen) as medical empiric therapy for idiopathic male infertility: a meta-analysis.|journal=Andrology|date=September 2013|volume=1|issue=5|pages=749–57|pmid=23970453|doi=10.1111/j.2047-2927.2013.00107.x}}</ref>

===Gynecomastia===
Tamoxifen is used to prevent or treat [[gynecomastia]].<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/748626_6 | title = Gynecomastia: Incidence, Causes, and Treatment: Treatment  | publisher = [[Medscape]]}}</ref> It is taken as a preventative measure in small doses, or used at the onset of any symptoms such as nipple soreness or sensitivity. Other drugs are taken for similar purposes such as [[clomiphene citrate]] and the anti-aromatase drugs which are used in order to try to avoid the hormone-related adverse effects.

===Others===
Occasionally tamoxifen is used in treatment of the rare conditions of [[retroperitoneal fibrosis]]<ref name="pmid16418409">{{cite journal | vauthors = van Bommel EF, Hendriksz TR, Huiskes AW, Zeegers AG | title = Brief communication: tamoxifen therapy for nonmalignant retroperitoneal fibrosis | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 144 | issue = 2 | pages = 101–6 | date = Jan 2006 | pmid = 16418409 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-144-2-200601170-00007 }}</ref> and [[idiopathic sclerosing mesenteritis]].<ref name="pmid17478346">{{cite journal | vauthors = Akram S, Pardi DS, Schaffner JA, Smyrk TC | title = Sclerosing mesenteritis: clinical features, treatment, and outcome in ninety-two patients | journal = Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = 589–96; quiz 523–4 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17478346 | pmc = | doi = 10.1016/j.cgh.2007.02.032 }}</ref>

==Side effects==
A report in September 2009 from Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality suggests that tamoxifen, raloxifene, and tibolone used to treat breast cancer significantly reduce invasive breast cancer in midlife and older women, but also increase the risk of adverse side effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oncogenetics.org/web/Medications-Effective-in-Reducing-Risk-of-Breast-Cancer-But-Increase-Risk-of-Adverse-Effects |title=Medications Effective in Reducing Risk of Breast Cancer But Increase Risk of Adverse Effects |author=OncoGenetics.Org |publisher=OncoGenetics.Org |accessdate=2009-09-14 |date=September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924092345/http://www.oncogenetics.org/web/Medications-Effective-in-Reducing-Risk-of-Breast-Cancer-But-Increase-Risk-of-Adverse-Effects |archivedate=September 24, 2009 }}</ref>
 
Some cases of lower-limb lymphedema have been associated with the use of tamoxifen, due to the blood clots and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) that can be caused by this medication. Resolution of the blood clots or DVT is needed before lymphedema treatment can be initiated.
 
===Bone===
A beneficial side effect of tamoxifen is that it prevents bone loss by acting as an ER [[agonist]] (i.e., mimicking the effects of estrogen) in this cell type. Therefore, by inhibiting [[osteoclasts]], it prevents [[osteoporosis]].<ref name="pmid17803905">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakamura T, Imai Y, Matsumoto T, Sato S, Takeuchi K, Igarashi K, Harada Y, Azuma Y, Krust A, Yamamoto Y, Nishina H, Takeda S, Takayanagi H, Metzger D, Kanno J, Takaoka K, Martin TJ, Chambon P, Kato S | title = Estrogen prevents bone loss via estrogen receptor alpha and induction of Fas ligand in osteoclasts | journal = Cell | volume = 130 | issue = 5 | pages = 811–23 | date = Sep 2007 | pmid = 17803905 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2007.07.025 }}</ref><ref name="pmid18219273">{{cite journal | vauthors = Krum SA, Miranda-Carboni GA, Hauschka PV, Carroll JS, Lane TF, Freedman LP, Brown M | title = Estrogen protects bone by inducing Fas ligand in osteoblasts to regulate osteoclast survival | journal = The EMBO Journal | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 535–45 | date = Feb 2008 | pmid = 18219273 | pmc = 2241656 | doi = 10.1038/sj.emboj.7601984 }}</ref> When tamoxifen was launched as a drug, it was thought that tamoxifen would act as an ER antagonist in all tissue, including bone, and therefore it was feared that it would contribute to osteoporosis. It was therefore very surprising that the opposite effect was observed clinically. Hence tamoxifen's tissue selective action directly led to the formulation of the concept of SERMs.<ref name="Mincey_2000">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mincey BA, Moraghan TJ, Perez EA | title = Prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in women with breast cancer | journal = Mayo Clinic Proceedings | volume = 75 | issue = 8 | pages = 821–9 | date = Aug 2000 | pmid = 10943237 | doi = 10.4065/75.8.821 }}</ref> In contrast tamoxifen appears to be associated with bone loss in premenopausal women who continue to menstruate after adjuvant chemotherapy.<ref name="pmid16446340">{{cite journal | vauthors = Vehmanen L, Elomaa I, Blomqvist C, Saarto T | title = Tamoxifen treatment after adjuvant chemotherapy has opposite effects on bone mineral density in premenopausal patients depending on menstrual status | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 675–80 | date = Feb 2006 | pmid = 16446340 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2005.02.3515 }}</ref>

The [[American Cancer Society]] lists tamoxifen as a known [[carcinogen]], stating that it increases the risk of some types of uterine cancer while lowering the risk of breast cancer recurrence.<ref name="ACS">{{cite web| url =http://www.cancer.org/docroot/PED/content/PED_1_3x_Known_and_Probable_Carcinogens.asp?sitearea=PED| title =Known and Probable Carcinogens| accessdate =2008-03-21| author =| authorlink =| coauthors =| date =2006-02-03| work =| publisher =American Cancer Society| pages =| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080317051133/http://www.cancer.org/docroot/PED/content/PED_1_3x_Known_and_Probable_Carcinogens.asp?sitearea=PED| archivedate =2008-03-17| quote =| deadurl =no| df =}}</ref> The ACS states that its use should not be avoided in cases where the risk of breast cancer recurrence without the drug is higher than the risk of developing uterine cancer with the drug.

4-OHT binds to ER competitively (with respect to the endogenous agonist estrogen) in tumor cells and other tissue targets, producing a nuclear complex that decreases DNA synthesis and inhibits estrogen effects. It is a nonsteroidal agent with potent antiestrogenic properties which compete with estrogen for [[Cell signaling|binding sites]] in breast and other tissues. Tamoxifen causes cells to remain in the G<sub>0</sub> and G<sub>1</sub> phases of the [[cell cycle]]. Because it prevents (pre)cancerous cells from dividing but does not cause cell death, tamoxifen is cytostatic rather than cytocidal.
 
The scientific literature is complex with respect to the activity of tamoxifen, and care should be taken to establish whether tamoxifen, or the 4-hydroxy metabolite was used, especially in in vitro assays.

N,N-Didesmethyl-4-hydroxytamoxifen ([[norendoxifen]]), another [[active metabolite]] of tamoxifen, has been found to act as a potent competitive [[aromatase inhibitor]] ([[IC50|IC<sub>50</sub>]] = 90 nM), and may also be involved in its antiestrogenic activity.<ref name="pmid23824607">{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu J, Flockhart PJ, Lu D, Lv W, Lu WJ, Han X, Cushman M, Flockhart DA | title = Inhibition of cytochrome p450 enzymes by the e- and z-isomers of norendoxifen | journal = Drug Metab.

==History==
In the late 1950s, pharmaceutical companies were actively researching a newly discovered class of anti-estrogen compounds in the hope of developing a morning-after contraceptive pill.
Arthur L Walpole was a reproductive [[endocrinologist]] who led such a team at the [[Alderley Park]] research laboratories of [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] Pharmaceuticals. It was there in 1966 that Dora Richardson first synthesised tamoxifen, known then as ICI-46,474.<ref name="isbn0-471-89979-8">{{cite book | last = Sneader | first = Walter | name-list-format = vanc | title = Drug Discovery: A History | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-471-89979-8 | oclc = | doi = | page = 472 pages }}</ref>
Walpole and his colleagues filed a UK patent covering this compound in 1962, but patent protection on this compound was repeatedly denied in the US until the 1980s.<ref name="Jordan_2003">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jordan VC | title = Tamoxifen: a most unlikely pioneering medicine | journal = Nature Reviews.

A link between estrogen and breast cancer had been known for many years, but cancer treatments were not a corporate priority at the time, and Walpole's personal interests were important in keeping support for the compound alive in the face of this and the lack of patent protection.<ref name="Jordan_2006" />

Tamoxifen is one of three drugs in an [[angiogenesis inhibitor|anti-angiogenetic]] protocol developed by [[Judah Folkman|Dr. Judah Folkman]], a researcher at Children's Hospital at Harvard Medical School in Boston. Folkman discovered in the 1970s that [[angiogenesis]] – the growth of new blood vessels – plays a significant role in the development of cancer. Since his discovery, an entirely new field of cancer research has developed. Clinical trials on [[angiogenesis inhibitor]]s have been underway since 1992 using myriad different drugs. The Harvard researchers developed a specific protocol for a golden retriever named Navy who was cancer-free after receiving the prescribed cocktail of [[celecoxib]], [[doxycycline]], and tamoxifen – the treatment subsequently became known as the Navy Protocol.<ref name="urlUSA_Today">{{cite web | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2002-07-24-cover-cancer_x.htm | title = Dog's tale of survival opens door in cancer research | author = Kirk E | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | date = 2002-07-24 | work = Health and Behavior | publisher = USA Today | pages =  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080628110635/http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2002-07-24-cover-cancer_x.htm | archivedate = 2008-06-28 | quote =  | accessdate = 2008-06-24 | deadurl = no | df =  }}</ref> Furthermore, tamoxifen treatment alone has been shown to have anti-angiogenetic effects in animal models of cancer which appear to be, at least in part, independent of tamoxifen's ER antagonist properties.<ref name="pmid11106254">{{cite journal | vauthors = Blackwell KL, Haroon ZA, Shan S, Saito W, Broadwater G, Greenberg CS, Dewhirst MW | title = Tamoxifen inhibits angiogenesis in estrogen receptor-negative animal models | journal = Clinical Cancer Research | volume = 6 | issue = 11 | pages = 4359–64 | date = Nov 2000 | pmid = 11106254 | doi =  | url = http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/6/11/4359 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080906195254/http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/6/11/4359 | archivedate = 2008-09-06 | df =  }}</ref>

1980 saw the publication of the first trial to show that tamoxifen given in addition to chemotherapy improved survival for patients with early breast cancer.<ref name="Baum_2003">{{cite journal | vauthors = Baum M, Brinkley DM, Dossett JA, McPherson K, Patterson JS, Rubens RD, Smiddy FG, Stoll BA, Wilson A, Lea JC, Richards D, Ellis SH | title = Improved survival among patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen after mastectomy for early breast cancer | journal = Lancet | volume = 2 | issue = 8347 | pages = 450 | date = Aug 1983 | pmid = 6135926 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(83)90406-3 }}</ref> In advanced disease, tamoxifen is now only recognized as effective in ER+ patients, but the early trials did not select ER+ patients, and by the mid 1980s the clinical trial picture was not showing a major advantage for tamoxifen.<ref name="FURR_1984">{{cite journal | vauthors = Furr BJ, Jordan VC | title = The pharmacology and clinical uses of tamoxifen | journal = Pharmacology & Therapeutics | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 127–205 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6438654 | doi = 10.1016/0163-7258(84)90043-3 }}</ref> Nevertheless, tamoxifen had a relatively mild side-effect profile, and a number of large trials continued.

This story is told in: V. Craig Jordan, ed. 2013. "Estrogen Action, Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators and Women's Health" Imperial College Press, Singapore.

It was not until 1998 that the meta-analysis of the Oxford-based Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group showed definitively that tamoxifen saved lives in early breast cancer.<ref name="pmid9605801">{{cite journal | author = Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group | title = Tamoxifen for early breast cancer: an overview of the randomised trials.

==Society and culture==
===Economics===
Global sales of tamoxifen in 2001 were $1,024 million.<ref name="urlCancer the generic impact">{{cite web| url =http://www.bioportfolio.com/news/datamonitor_16.htm| title =Cancer the generic impact| author =| authorlink =| coauthors =| date =| work =| publisher =BioPortfolio Limited| pages =| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080516032316/http://www.bioportfolio.com/news/datamonitor_16.htm| archivedate =2008-05-16| quote =| accessdate =2008-11-14| deadurl =yes| df =}}</ref>
Since the expiration of the patent in 2002, it is now widely available as a [[generic drug]] around the world.
As of 2004, tamoxifen was the world's largest selling hormonal drug for the treatment of breast cancer.<ref name="urlwww.astrazeneca.se">{{cite web| url =http://www.astrazeneca.com/_mshost3690701/content/resources/media/investors/2004-abr-brent-vose-oncology.pdf| title =AstraZenecain Cancer: Slide #15:| author =Vose B| authorlink =| coauthors =| date =| work =AstraZeneca Annual Business Review| publisher =www.astrazeneca.com| pages =| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100131160325/http://astrazeneca.com/_mshost3690701/content/resources/media/investors/2004-abr-brent-vose-oncology.pdf| archivedate =2010-01-31| quote =2004 tamoxifen market share: 70% Source: IMS HEALTH, IMS MIDAS Monthly.

==Research==
Tamoxifen is used as a research tool to trigger tissue-specific gene expression in many conditional expression constructs in genetically modified animals including a version of the [[Cre-Lox recombination]] technique.<ref name="pmid8855277">{{cite journal | vauthors = Feil R, Brocard J, Mascrez B, LeMeur M, Metzger D, Chambon P | title = Ligand-activated site-specific recombination in mice | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 93 | issue = 20 | pages = 10887–90 | date = Oct 1996 | pmid = 8855277 | pmc = 38252 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.93.20.10887 | bibcode = 1996PNAS...9310887F }}</ref>

The drug has also been studied in several additional indications.

===Riedel's thyroiditis===
Tamoxifen has been proposed as part of a treatment plan for [[Riedel's thyroiditis]].<ref name="pmid12698518">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dabelic N, Jukic T, Labar Z, Novosel SA, Matesa N, Kusic Z | title = Riedel's thyroiditis treated with tamoxifen | journal = Croatian Medical Journal | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages = 239–41 | date = Apr 2003 | pmid = 12698518 | doi =  | url = http://www.cmj.hr/2003/44/2/12698518.pdf | format = PDF | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080910130853/http://www.cmj.hr/2003/44/2/12698518.pdf | archivedate = 2008-09-10 | df =  }}</ref>

===Bipolar disorder===
Tamoxifen has been shown to be effective in the treatment of [[mania]] in patients with [[bipolar disorder]] by blocking [[protein kinase C]] (PKC), an [[enzyme]] that regulates [[neuron]] activity in the [[brain]]. Researchers believe PKC is over-active during the mania in bipolar patients.<ref name="nimh">{{cite web |publisher= [[National Institute of Mental Health|National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)]] |title= Manic Phase of Bipolar Disorder Benefits from Breast Cancer Medication |url= http://www.nimh.nih.gov/science-news/2007/manic-phase-of-bipolar-disorder-benefits-from-breast-cancer-medication.shtml |date= September 12, 2007 |accessdate= 2008-03-10 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071013184947/http://nimh.nih.gov/science-news/2007/manic-phase-of-bipolar-disorder-benefits-from-breast-cancer-medication.shtml |archivedate= October 13, 2007 |df=  }}</ref><ref name="pmid18316672">{{cite journal | vauthors = Yildiz A, Guleryuz S, Ankerst DP, Ongür D, Renshaw PF | title = Protein kinase C inhibition in the treatment of mania: a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of tamoxifen | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 65 | issue = 3 | pages = 255–63 | date = Mar 2008 | pmid = 18316672 | doi = 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2007.43 }}</ref>

===McCune-Albright syndrome===
In [[McCune-Albright syndrome]] (MAS) tamoxifen has been used to treat [[premature puberty]] and the consequences of premature puberty. Tamoxifen has been seen to decrease rapid bone maturation which is the result of excessive estrogen and alter predicted adult height (PAH).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Eugster EA, Shankar R, Feezle LK, Pescovitz OH | title = Tamoxifen treatment of progressive precocious puberty in a patient with McCune-Albright syndrome | journal = Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 681–6 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10703542 | doi=10.1515/jpem.1999.12.5.681}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Eugster EA, Rubin SD, Reiter EO, Plourde P, Jou HC, Pescovitz OH | title = Tamoxifen treatment for precocious puberty in McCune-Albright syndrome: a multicenter trial | journal = The Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 143 | issue = 1 | pages = 60–6 | date = Jul 2003 | pmid = 12915825 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-3476(03)00128-8 }}</ref> The same effects have also been seen in short pubertal boys.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kreher NC, Eugster EA, Shankar RR | title = The use of tamoxifen to improve height potential in short pubertal boys | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 116 | issue = 6 | pages = 1513–5 | date = Dec 2005 | pmid = 16322179 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2005-0577 }}</ref>

However, one ''in vitro'' study in 2007 and later an ''in vivo'' study in 2008 have shown that tamoxifen induces apoptosis in growth plate chondrocytes, reduces serum [[IGF-I]] levels and causes persistent retardation of longitudinal and cortical radial bone growth in young male rats, leading the researches to express concern giving tamoxifen to growing individuals.<ref name="pmid18348701"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chagin AS, Karimian E, Zaman F, Takigawa M, Chrysis D, Sävendahl L | title = Tamoxifen induces permanent growth arrest through selective induction of apoptosis in growth plate chondrocytes in cultured rat metatarsal bones | journal = Bone | volume = 40 | issue = 5 | pages = 1415–24 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17293177 | doi = 10.1016/j.bone.2006.12.066 }}</ref>
