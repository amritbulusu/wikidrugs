'''Triflusal''' is a [[platelet aggregation inhibitor]] that was discovered and developed in the Uriach Laboratories, and commercialised in Spain since 1981. Currently, it is available in 25 countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and America. It is a drug of the [[salicylate]] family but it is not a derivative of [[acetylsalicylic acid]] (ASA). Trade names include '''Disgren''', '''Grendis''', '''Aflen''' and '''Triflux'''.<ref>Murdoch D, et al. Triflusal: a review of its use in cerebral infarction and [[myocardial infarction]], and as thromboprophylaxis in atrial fibrillation.Drugs 2006; 66(5):671-92</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Triflusal is a selective platelet antiaggregant through;
* blocks [[cyclooxygenase]] inhibiting [[thromboxane A2]], preventing aggregation
* preserves vascular [[prostacyclin]], thus promoting anti-aggregant effect
* blocks [[phosphodiesterase]] thereby increasing [[cyclic AMP|cAMP]] concentration, thereby promoting anti-aggregant effect due to inhibition of calcium mobilization

==Indication==
Triflusal is indicated for;
* Prevention of [[cardiovascular events]] such as [[stroke]]
* Acute treatment of [[cerebral infarction]], [[myocardial infarction]]
* [[Thromboprophylaxis]] due to [[atrial fibrillation]]

==Prevention of stroke==
In the 2008 guidelines for stroke management from the European Stroke Organization, triflusal was for the first time recommended as lone therapy, as an alternative to acetylsalicylic acid plus [[dipyridamole]], or [[clopidogrel]] alone for secondary prevention of [[atherothrombosis|atherothrombotic]] stroke. This recommendation was based on the double-blind, randomised TACIP and TAPIRSS trials, which found triflusal to be equally as effective as Aspirin in preventing post-stroke vascular events, while having a more favourable safety profile.<ref>Matías-Guiu J, Ferro JM, Alvarez J, et al; for the TACIP Investigators.

The European Stroke Organization(ESO) Executive Committee and the ESO Writing Committee.Cerebrovasc Dis. 2008; 25: 57-507</ref>

==Pharmacokinetics==
It is absorbed in the small intestine and its [[bio-availability]] ranges from 83% to 100%.<ref>Ramis J, Mis R, Conte L, Forn J. Rat and human plasma protein binding of the main metabolite of triflusal. Eur J Pharmacol.1990; 183: 1867-1868</ref><ref>Ramis J, Mis R, Forn J, Torrent J, Gorina E, Jané F.
