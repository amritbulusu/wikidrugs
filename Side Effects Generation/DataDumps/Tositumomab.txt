'''Tositumomab''' is a murine IgG2a lambda monoclonal antibody directed against the [[CD20]] antigen, produced in mammalian cells.<ref name=Label>GlaxoSmithKline and FDA> [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/125011s0126lbl.pdf Bexxar label].  Last updated August 2012.  Page accessed January 18, 2016</ref> Combined with [[radioisotope]] [[iodine 131]]<ref name=Timmerman2013/> it was called '''Iodine I 131 Tositumomab'''.  Unlabelled tositumomab together with iodine-labelled tositumomab was called '''Bexxar'''<ref name=Label/>  and a personlized regimen using Bexxar was approved for the treatment of relapsed or [[chemotherapy]]/[[rituxan]]-[[refractory]] [[Non-Hodgkin lymphoma]] in 2003.<ref name=Srinivasan2011rev>Srinivasan A, Mukherji SK.

The treatment regimen was personalized for each person receiving the drug in order to maximize the radiation delivered to the tumor and to minimize the amount of radiation to which the person would be exposed.<ref name=Label/><ref name=2002Descrip>FDA [http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/02/briefing/3916B1_02_D-FDA%20-%20Product%20Description.pdf Description of the Product]. December 17, 2002.  Linked from index page [http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/02/briefing/3916b1.htm here.</ref>{{rp|14–15}}  A first dose of labelled antibody was given once, and whole-body radiation was measured with a [[gamma camera]] over seven days.  Analysis of that imaging data allowed an optimal dose of labelled antibody to be calculated, which was then administered once a day, for up to seven days.<ref name=Label/><ref name=2002Descrip/>{{rp|14–15}}  Each time the labelled antibody was administered, it was always preceded by unlabelled antibody because early clinical trials had shown that  total body residence times of radioactivity were longer in people who first received unlabelled antibody, so that a lower dose of labelled antibody was needed to deliver the required total dose of radiation; additionally labelled antibody targeted tumors better in people pre-treated with unlabelled antibody.<ref name=2002Descrip/>{{rp|21}}

This drug combination was developed by [[Corixa (company)|Corixa]] which was purchased by [[GlaxoSmithKline]] in 2005.<ref>Carla Mozee for MarketWatch.  April 29, 2005 [http://www.marketwatch.com/story/corixa-agrees-to-glaxo-acquisition-for-300-million Glaxo to acquire Corixa for $300 million]</ref>  It was sold for about $25,000 for one round of treatment.<ref name=Srinivasan2011rev/>

Sale of Bexxar was discontinued and marketing approval was withdrawn in February 2014 due to the decline in usage (fewer than 75 patients in 2012) even though it had a 70% response rate; the lack of demand was due to the fact that oncologists could not sell it directly to patients but had to refer patients to third parties, and the emergence of other drugs that were as good and could be administered by the oncologists.<ref name=Timmerman2013>{{cite web | url = http://www.xconomy.com/national/2013/08/26/why-good-drugs-sometimes-fail-in-the-market-the-bexxar-story/ | title = Why Good Drugs Sometimes Fail: The Bexxar Story}}</ref><ref>Notice by the Food and Drug Administration on October 23, 2013.
