'''Rofecoxib''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|r|ɒ|f|ᵻ|ˈ|k|ɒ|k|s|ɪ|b}} is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ([[NSAID]]) that has now been withdrawn over safety concerns. It was marketed by [[Merck & Co.]] to treat [[osteoarthritis]], [[acute pain]] conditions, and [[dysmenorrhea]]. Rofecoxib was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on May 20, 1999, and was marketed under the [[brand name]]s '''Vioxx''', '''Ceoxx''', and '''Ceeoxx'''.

Rofecoxib gained widespread acceptance among physicians treating patients with arthritis and other conditions causing chronic or acute pain. Worldwide, over 80 million people were prescribed rofecoxib at some time.<ref name="NPR_Merck_2004">{{citation |title=Merck Pulls Arthritis Drug Vioxx from Market |date=September 30, 2004 |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4054991 |first=Richard |last=Knox |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111103315/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4054991 |archive-date=November 11, 2010 |accessdate=December 24, 2016}}</ref>

On September 30, 2004, Merck withdrew rofecoxib from the market because of concerns about increased risk of [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and [[stroke]] associated with long-term, high-dosage use. Merck withdrew the drug after disclosures that it withheld information about rofecoxib's risks from doctors and patients for over five years, resulting in between 88,000 and 140,000 cases of serious heart disease.<ref>{{cite news<!--double param: | work=Slate--> | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn6918-up-to-140000-heart-attacks-linked-to-vioxx.html | title=Up to 140,000 heart attacks linked to Vioxx. | work=[[New Scientist]] | date=2005-01-25 |page=1 }}</ref> Rofecoxib was one of the most widely used drugs ever to be withdrawn from the market.

Rofecoxib was available on [[Medical prescription|prescription]] in both tablet-form and as an oral suspension. It was available by injection for hospital use.

==Mode of action==
{{See also|Cyclooxygenase}}
[[Cyclooxygenase]] (COX) has two well-studied isoforms, called COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 mediates the synthesis of [[prostaglandins]] responsible for protection of the stomach lining, while COX-2 mediates the synthesis of prostaglandins responsible for pain and inflammation. By creating "selective" NSAIDs that inhibit COX-2, but not COX-1, the same pain relief as traditional NSAIDs is offered, but with greatly reduced risk of fatal or debilitating peptic ulcers. Rofecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor, or "coxib".

Others include Merck's [[etoricoxib]] (Arcoxia), Pfizer’s [[celecoxib]] (Celebrex) and [[valdecoxib]] (Bextra). Interestingly, at the time of its withdrawal, rofecoxib was the only coxib with clinical evidence of its superior gastrointestinal adverse effect profile over conventional NSAIDs. This was largely based on the VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, which compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of rofecoxib and [[naproxen]].<ref name="Bombardier 2000">{{Cite journal

On March 11, 2009, [[Scott Reuben|Scott S. Reuben]], former chief of acute pain at Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, Mass., revealed that data for 21 studies he had authored for the efficacy of the drug (along with others such as [[celecoxib]]) had been fabricated in order to augment the analgesic effects of the drugs. There is no evidence that Reuben colluded with Merck in falsifying his data. Reuben was also a former paid spokesperson for the drug company [[Pfizer]] (which owns the intellectual property rights for marketing celecoxib in the United States). The retracted studies were not submitted to either the FDA or the European Union's regulatory agencies prior to the drug's approval. Drug manufacturer [[Merck & Co.|Merck]] had no comment on the disclosure.<ref name="WSJ-3-2009">{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123672510903888207?mod=loomia&loomia_si=t0:a16:g2:r1:c0.0270612:b22894832 | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Top Pain Scientist Fabricated Data in Studies, Hospital Says | first=Keith J. | last=Winstein | date=March 11, 2009}}</ref><ref name="WSJ_Mathews_2004">{{citation |title=E-Mails Suggest Merck Knew Vioxx's Dangers at Early Stage As Heart-Risk Evidence Rose: Officials Played Hardball; Internal Message: 'Dodge!' |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB109926864290160719 |authors=Anna Wilde Mathews and Barbara Martinez |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=November 1, 2004}}</ref>

{{See also|Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug}}

[[Image:VIOXX sample blister pack.jpg|right|100px]]Aside from the reduced incidence of gastric ulceration, rofecoxib exhibits a similar adverse effect profile to other [[NSAID]]s.
Prostaglandin is a large family of lipids. Prostaglandin I2/PGI2/prostacyclin is just one member of it. Prostaglandins other than PGI2 (such as PGE2) also play important roles in vascular tone regulation. Prostacyclin/thromboxane are produced by both COX-1 and COX-2, and rofecoxib suppresses just COX-2 enzyme, so there is no reason to believe that prostacyclin levels are significantly reduced by the drug. And there is no reason to believe that only the balance between quantities of prostacyclin and thromboxane is the determinant factor for vascular tone.<ref>{{Cite journal

====VIGOR study and publishing controversy====
The VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, conducted by Bombardier, et al., which compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of rofecoxib and naproxen, had indicated a significant 4-fold increased risk of acute [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack) in rofecoxib patients when compared with [[naproxen]] patients (0.4% vs 0.1%, [[relative risk|RR]] 0.25) over the 12-month span of the study. The elevated risk began during the second month on rofecoxib. There was no significant difference in the mortality from cardiovascular events between the two groups, nor was there any significant difference in the rate of myocardial infarction between the rofecoxib and naproxen treatment groups in patients without high cardiovascular risk. The difference in overall risk was by the patients at higher risk of heart attack, i.e. those meeting the criteria for low-dose aspirin prophylaxis of secondary cardiovascular events (previous myocardial infarction, angina, [[cerebrovascular accident]], [[transient ischemic attack]], or [[coronary artery bypass graft|coronary artery bypass]]).

Merck's scientists interpreted the finding as a protective effect of naproxen, telling the FDA that the difference in heart attacks "is primarily due to" this protective effect.<ref name="Cardio">{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/01/briefing/3677b2_06_cardio.pdf|format=PDF|title=NAME OF DRUG: Rofecoxib (MK-0966) : Memorandum|publisher=Fda.gov|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref> Some commentators have noted that naproxen would have to be three times as effective as [[aspirin]] to account for all of the difference,<ref>[http://www.powerlinefacts.com/Sciam_article_on_lobbying.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104200843/http://www.powerlinefacts.com/Sciam_article_on_lobbying.htm |date=January 4, 2015 }}</ref> and some outside scientists warned Merck that this claim was implausible before VIGOR was published.<ref>[http://www.saferdrugsnow.org/documents/vio/E-mailreCarloPatronoVIGOR.pdf]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625011642/http://www.saferdrugsnow.org/documents/vio/E-mailreCarloPatronoVIGOR.pdf |date=June 25, 2006 }}</ref> No evidence has since emerged for such a large cardioprotective effect of naproxen, although a number of studies have found protective effects similar in size to those of aspirin.<ref>{{Cite journal

The results of the VIGOR study were submitted to the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in February 2001. In September 2001, the FDA sent a warning letter to the CEO of Merck, stating, "Your promotional campaign discounts the fact that in the VIGOR study, patients on Vioxx were observed to have a four to five fold increase in myocardial infarctions (MIs) compared to patients on the comparator non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), Naprosyn (naproxen)."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/EnforcementActivitiesbyFDA/WarningLettersandNoticeofViolationLetterstoPharmaceuticalCompanies/UCM166383.pdf|format=PDF|title=Warning Letter|publisher=Fda.gov|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref> This led to the introduction, in April 2002, of warnings on Vioxx labeling concerning the increased risk of cardiovascular events (heart attack and stroke).

Months after the preliminary version of VIGOR was published in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'', the journal editors learned that certain data reported to the FDA were not included in the ''NEJM'' article. Several years later, when they were shown a Merck memo during the depositions for the first federal Vioxx trial, they realized that these data had been available to the authors months before publication. The editors wrote an editorial accusing the authors of deliberately withholding the data.<ref name="Curfman 2006a">{{Cite journal

''NEJM'' editor Gregory Curfman explained that the quick release was due to the imminent presentation of his deposition testimony, which he feared would be misinterpreted in the media. He had earlier denied any relationship between the timing of the editorial and the trial. Although his testimony was not actually used in the December trial, Curfman had testified well before the publication of the editorial.<ref>[https://www.forbes.com/work/feeds/ap/2006/02/13/ap2523250.html] {{dead link|date=December 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>

The editors charged that "more than four months before the article was published, at least two of its authors were aware of critical data on an array of adverse cardiovascular events that were not included in the VIGOR article." These additional data included three additional heart attacks, and raised the relative risk of Vioxx from 4.25-fold to 5-fold. All the additional heart attacks occurred in the group at low risk of heart attack (the "aspirin not indicated" group) and the editors noted that the omission "resulted in the misleading conclusion that there was a difference in the risk of myocardial infarction between the aspirin indicated and aspirin not indicated groups." The relative risk for myocardial infarctions among the aspirin not indicated patients increased from 2.25 to 3 (although it remained statistically insignificant). The editors also noted a statistically significant (2-fold) increase in risk for serious thromboembolic events for this group, an outcome that Merck had not reported in the ''NEJM'', though it had disclosed that information publicly in March 2000, eight months before publication.<ref name="Curfman 2006b">{{Cite journal

The authors of the study, including the non-Merck authors, responded by claiming that the three additional heart attacks had occurred after the prespecified cutoff date for data collection and thus were appropriately not included. (Utilizing the prespecified cutoff date also meant that an additional stroke in the naproxen population was not reported.) Furthermore, they said that the additional data did not qualitatively change any of the conclusions of the study, and the results of the full analyses were disclosed to the FDA and reflected on the Vioxx warning label. They further noted that all of the data in the "omitted" table were printed in the text of the article. The authors stood by the original article.<ref>{{Cite journal

''NEJM'' stood by its editorial, noting that the cutoff date was never mentioned in the article, nor did the authors report that the cutoff for cardiovascular adverse events was before that for gastrointestinal adverse events. The different cutoffs increased the reported benefits of Vioxx (reduced stomach problems) relative to the risks (increased heart attacks).<ref name="Curfman 2006b"/>

On May 15, 2006, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that a late night email, written by an outside public relations specialist and sent to ''Journal'' staffers hours before the Expression of Concern was released, predicted that "the rebuke would divert attention to Merck and induce the media to ignore the ''New England Journal of Medicine''{{'}}s own role in aiding Vioxx sales."<ref name="WSJ515">{{cite news| author=David Armstrong | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB114765430315252591 | title=How the New England Journal Missed Warning Signs on Vioxx | work=[[Wall Street Journal]] | date=2006-05-15 |page=A1 }}</ref>

====Alzheimer's disease====
In 2000 and 2001, Merck conducted several studies of rofecoxib aimed at determining if the drug slowed the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Merck has placed great emphasis on these studies on the grounds that they are relatively large (almost 3000 patients) and compared rofecoxib to a placebo rather than to another pain reliever. These studies found an elevated death rate among rofecoxib patients, although the deaths were not generally heart-related. However, they did not find any elevated cardiovascular risk due to rofecoxib.<ref>{{Cite journal

In 2001, Merck commenced the APPROVe (Adenomatous Polyp PRevention On Vioxx) study, a three-year trial with the primary aim of evaluating the efficacy of rofecoxib for the [[prophylaxis]] of [[polyp (medicine)|colorectal polyps]]. [[Celecoxib]] had already been approved for this indication, and it was hoped to add this to the indications for rofecoxib as well. An additional aim of the study was to further evaluate the cardiovascular safety of rofecoxib.

The APPROVe study was terminated early when the preliminary data from the study showed an increased relative [[risk]] of adverse thrombotic cardiovascular events (including [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and [[stroke]]), beginning after 18 months of rofecoxib therapy. In patients taking rofecoxib, versus [[placebo]], the relative risk of these events was 1.92 (rofecoxib 1.50 events vs placebo 0.78 events per 100 patient years). The results from the first 18 months of the APPROVe study did not show an increased relative risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Moreover, overall and cardiovascular mortality rates were similar between the rofecoxib and placebo populations.<ref name="Bresalier 2005">{{Cite journal

In summary, the APPROVe study suggested that long-term use of rofecoxib resulted in nearly twice the risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke compared to patients receiving a placebo.

====Other studies====
Pre-approval Phase III [[clinical trials]], like the APPROVe study, showed no increased relative risk of adverse cardiovascular events for the first eighteen months of rofecoxib usage (Merck, 2004). Others have pointed out that "study 090," a pre-approval trial, showed a 3-fold increase in cardiovascular events compared to placebo, a 7-fold increase compared to nabumetone (another [NSAID]), and an 8-fold increase in heart attacks and strokes combined compared to both control groups.<ref name="Cardio"/><ref>{{Cite journal

}}</ref> Although this was a relatively small study and only the last result was statistically significant, critics have charged that this early finding should have prompted Merck to quickly conduct larger studies of rofecoxib's cardiovascular safety. Merck notes that it had already begun VIGOR at the time Study 090 was completed. Although VIGOR was primarily designed to demonstrate new uses for rofecoxib, it also collected data on adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

Several very large observational studies have also found elevated risk of heart attack from rofecoxib. For example, a recent retrospective study of 113,000 elderly Canadians suggested a borderline statistically significant increased relative risk of heart attacks of 1.24 from Vioxx usage, with a relative risk of 1.73 for higher-dose Vioxx usage. (Levesque, 2005). Another study, using [[Kaiser Permanente]] data, found a 1.47 relative risk for low-dose Vioxx usage and 3.58 for high-dose Vioxx usage compared to current use of celecoxib, though the smaller number was not statistically significant, and relative risk compared to other populations was not statistically significant. (Graham, 2005).

Furthermore, a more recent meta-study of 114 randomized trials with a total of 116,000+ participants, published in JAMA, showed that Vioxx uniquely increased risk of renal (kidney) disease, and heart arrhythmia.<ref name="cox2drugreview.org">{{Cite journal

Nevertheless, it is likely that trials of newer drugs in the category will be extended in order to supply additional evidence of cardiovascular safety. Examples are some more specific COX-2 inhibitors, including [[etoricoxib]] (Arcoxia) and [[lumiracoxib]] (Prexige), which are currently (circa 2005) undergoing Phase III/IV [[clinical trial]]s.

Besides, regulatory authorities worldwide now require warnings about cardiovascular risk of COX-2 inhibitors still on the market. For example, in 2005, EU regulators required the following changes to the product information and/or packaging of all COX-2 inhibitors:<ref name="EMEA2005">{{cite web |url=http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/press/pr/20776605en.pdf |publisher=European Medicines Agency |title=European Medicines Agency concludes action on COX-2 inhibitors |accessdate=2008-04-16 |format=pdf |work=}}</ref>

* Contraindications stating that COX-2 inhibitors must not be used in patients with established ischaemic heart disease and/or cerebrovascular disease (stroke), and also in patients with peripheral arterial disease
* Reinforced warnings to healthcare professionals to exercise caution when prescribing COX-2 inhibitors to patients with risk factors for heart disease, such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia (high cholesterol levels), diabetes and smoking
* Given the association between cardiovascular risk and exposure to COX-2 inhibitors, doctors are advised to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration of treatment

====Other NSAIDs====
Since the withdrawal of Vioxx it has come to light that there may be negative cardiovascular effects with not only other COX-2 inhibitiors, but even the majority of other NSAIDs. It is only with the recent development of drugs like Vioxx that drug companies have carried out the kind of well executed trials that could establish such effects and these sort of trials have never been carried out in older "trusted" NSAIDs such as [[ibuprofen]], [[diclofenac]] and others. The possible exceptions may be [[aspirin]] and [[naproxen]] due to their anti-platelet aggregation properties.

==Withdrawal==
Due to the findings of its own APPROVe study, Merck publicly announced its voluntary withdrawal of the drug from the market worldwide on September 30, 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/newsroom/vioxx/pdf/vioxx_press_release_final.pdf |title=Merck Announces Voluntary Worldwide Withdrawal of VIOXX |format=pdf |publisher=Merck.com |accessdate=4 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417053059/http://www.merck.com/newsroom/vioxx/pdf/vioxx_press_release_final.pdf |archivedate=17 April 2012 |df= }}</ref><ref name="NPR_2004">{{citation |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4054991 |work=National Public Radio (NPR) |date=2004 |title=Q&A on the case, following withdrawal announcement |accessdate=December 24, 2016}}</ref>

In addition to its own studies, on September 23, 2004, Merck apparently received information about new research by the FDA that supported previous findings of increased risk of heart attack among rofecoxib users (Grassley, 2004). FDA analysts estimated that Vioxx caused between 88,000 and 139,000 heart attacks, 30 to 40 percent of which were probably fatal, in the five years the drug was on the market.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/health/july-dec04/vioxx_11-18.html |title=Congress Questions Vioxx, FDA | accessdate = 2013-06-03 | date = 2004-11-18 | work= [[PBS NewsHour]] }}</ref>

On November 5, 2004, the medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'' published a [[meta-analysis]] of the available studies on the safety of rofecoxib<ref name="Jüni_2004_Lancet">{{cite journal |title=Risk of cardiovascular events and rofecoxib: cumulative meta-analysis |authors=Peter Jüni, Linda Nartey, Stephan Reichenbach, Rebekka Sterchi, Paul A Dieppe, Matthias Egger |journal=The Lancet |url=http://vioxxnationalclassaction.ca/Press/2004_11_06_Lancet.pdf |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429083940/http://vioxxnationalclassaction.ca/Press/2004_11_06_Lancet.pdf |archive-date=April 2016 |accessdate=December 24, 2016 |date=December 4, 2004 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17514-4 |volume=364 |issue=9450 |pages=2021–2029}}</ref> (Jüni ''et al.'', 2004). The authors concluded that, owing to the known [[cardiovascular]] risk, rofecoxib should have been withdrawn several years earlier. ''The Lancet'' published an editorial which condemned both Merck and the FDA for the continued availability of rofecoxib from 2000 until the recall.<ref>[http://thelancet.com/journal/vol364/iss9446/full/llan.364.9446.early_online_publication.31178.1]  {{dead link|date=January 2015}}</ref><ref name="Lancet_Implosion_Merck_2004">{{cite journal |title=Vioxx, the Implosion of Merck, and Aftershocks at the FDA |last=Horton |first=Richard |journal=The Lancet |date= December 2004|volume=364 |issue=9450 |pages=1995–1996 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17523-5}}</ref> Merck responded by issuing a rebuttal of the Jüni ''et al.'' meta-analysis that noted that Jüni omitted several studies that showed no increased cardiovascular risk. (Merck & Co., 2004).

In 2005, advisory panels in both the U.S. and Canada encouraged the return of rofecoxib to the market, stating that rofecoxib's benefits outweighed the risks for some patients. The FDA advisory panel voted 17-15 to allow the drug to return to the market despite being found to increase heart risk. The vote in Canada was 12-1, and the Canadian panel noted that the cardiovascular risks from rofecoxib seemed to be no worse than those from [[ibuprofen]]&mdash;though the panel stated that further study was needed for all NSAIDs to fully understand their risk profiles. Notwithstanding these recommendations, Merck has not returned rofecoxib to the market.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/prodpharma/activit/sci-consult/cox2/sap_summary_gcs_sommaire_cox2_e.html | title = SUMMARY: Report of the Expert Advisory Panel on the Safety of Cox-2 Selective Non-steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) | accessdate = 2011-06-04 | date = 2005-07-06 | publisher = [[Health Canada]] }}</ref>

===The Martin Report 2006===

In 2005, Merck retained [[John S. Martin Jr.]], a former US District Judge for the Southern District of New York and colleagues at Debevoise & Plimpton LLP to investigate Vioxx study results and communications conducted by Merck. Through the report, it was found that Merck's senior management acted in good faith, and that the confusion over the clinical safety of Vioxx was due to the sales team's overzealous behavior. The report that was filed gave a timeline of the events surrounding Vioxx and showed that Merck intended to operate honestly throughout the process. Any mistakes that were made regarding the mishandling of clinical trial results and withholding of information was the result of oversight, not malicious behavior. The Martin Report did conclude that the Merck's marketing team exaggerated the safety of Vioxx and replaced truthful information with sales tactics.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The report was published in February 2006, and Merck was satisfied with the findings of the report and promised to consider the recommendations contained in the Martin Report.<ref name="Martin_report_2006">{{cite report |title=Report of the Honorable Judge [[John S.

The first [[Wrongful death claim|wrongful death]] trial, ''Rogers v. Merck'', was scheduled in [[Alabama]] in the spring of 2005, but was postponed after Merck argued that the plaintiff had falsified evidence of rofecoxib use.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/13/business/13drug.html?ex=1271044800&en=3225bb00e74eab08&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland|title=Merck Asks for a Dismissal in First of Suits Over Vioxx|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=4 January 2015|first=Alex|last=Berenson|date=13 April 2005}}</ref>

On August 19, 2005, a jury in [[Texas]] voted 10-2 to hold Merck liable for the death of Robert Ernst, a 59-year-old man who allegedly died of a rofecoxib-induced heart attack. The plaintiff's lead attorney was [[Mark Lanier]]. Merck argued that the death was due to [[cardiac arrhythmia]], which had not been shown to be associated with rofecoxib use. The jury awarded Carol Ernst, widow of Robert Ernst, $253.4 million in damages. This award was capped at no more than US$26.1 million because of punitive damages limits under Texas law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9006921/|title=Jury finds Merck liable in landmark Vioxx case|work=msnbc.com|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref> Merck appealed and the verdict was overturned in 2008<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/business/article/Houston-court-rejects-Vioxx-death-link-26-1-1770637.php|title=Houston court rejects Vioxx-death link, $26.1 million award|work=chron.com|accessdate=28 September 2017}}</ref>.
On November 3, 2005, Merck won the second case ''Humeston v. Merck'', a personal injury case, in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. The plaintiff experienced a mild myocardial infarction and claimed that rofecoxib was responsible, after having taken it for two months. Merck argued that there was no evidence that rofecoxib was the cause of Humeston's injury and that there is no scientific evidence linking rofecoxib to cardiac events with short durations of use. The jury ruled that Merck had adequately warned doctors and patients of the drug's risk.<ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4988532]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921162135/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4988532 |date=September 21, 2015 }}</ref>

The first federal trial on rofecoxib, ''Plunkett v. Merck'', began on November 29, 2005 in [[Houston]]. The trial ended on December 12, 2005 when Judge Eldon E. Fallon of U.S. District Court declared a mistrial because of a [[hung jury]] with an eight to one majority, favoring the defense. Upon retrial in February 2006 in [[New Orleans]], where the Vioxx [[multidistrict litigation]] (MDL) is based, a jury found Merck not liable, even though the plaintiffs had the ''NEJM'' editor testify as to his objections to the VIGOR study.<ref name="NYT_Berenson_2005">{{citation |url=http://tech.mit.edu/V125/N61/61long4.html |title=Judge Declares Mistrial in Merck Vioxx Trial Because of Hung Jury |first=Alex |last=Berenson |publisher=The New York Times |date=December 13, 2005 |accessdate=December 24, 2016}}</ref>

On January 30, 2006, a New Jersey state court dismissed a case brought by Edgar Lee Boyd, who blamed Vioxx for gastrointestinal bleeding that he experienced after taking the drug. The judge said that Boyd failed to prove the drug caused his stomach pain and internal bleeding.

In January 2006, ''Garza v. Merck'' began trial in Rio Grande City, Texas. The plaintiff, a 71-year-old smoker with heart disease, had a fatal heart attack three weeks after finishing a one-week sample of rofecoxib. On April 21, 2006 the jury awarded the plaintiff $7 million compensatory and $25 million punitive. The Texas state court of appeals in San Antonio later ruled Garza's fatal heart attack probably resulted from pre-existing health conditions unrelated to his taking of Vioxx, thus reversing the $32 million jury award.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aVKMz77jAVo4&refer=home|title=Merck Wins Reversal of Jury's $32 Million Vioxx Award (Update3)|publisher=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref>

On April 5, 2006, the jury held Merck liable for the heart attack of 77-year-old John McDarby, and awarded Mr McDarby $4.5 million in compensatory damages based on Merck's failure to properly warn of Vioxx safety risks. After a hearing on April 11, 2006, the jury also awarded Mr McDarby an additional $9 million in punitive damages. The same jury found Merck not liable for the heart attack of 60-year-old Thomas Cona, a second plaintiff in the trial, but was liable for fraud in the sale of the drug to Cona.

In March 2010, an Australian class-action lawsuit against Merck ruled that Vioxx doubled the risk of heart attacks, and that Merck had breached the [[Trade Practices Act]] by selling a drug which was unfit for sale.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/drug-unfit-for-sale-says-judge-in-compo-case-20100305-powh.html|title=Drug unfit for sale, says judge in compo case|work=The Age|accessdate=4 January 2015|location=Melbourne}}</ref>
