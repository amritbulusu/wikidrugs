'''Corixa''' was a [[biotechnology]]/[[pharmaceutical]] company based in [[Seattle, Washington]] involved in the development of [[immunotherapy|immunotherapeutics]] to combat [[autoimmune disease]]s, [[infectious disease]]s, and [[cancer]]. It was founded in 1994. It operated a laboratory and production facility in [[Hamilton, Montana]].

The name Corixa comes from the true bug (Insecta: Hemiptera: Heteroptera) genus ''Corixa'' (family Corixidae, [[Corixidae|Water boatman]]), described by Geoffroy, in 1762.

On 12 July 2005, the European pharmaceuticals giant [[GlaxoSmithKline]] completed the acquisition of Corixa. GSK had formerly made use of the Corixa's MPL (''Monophosphoryl lipid A'', a derivative of the [[lipid A]] molecule), an [[adjuvant]] in some of their [[vaccine]]s.

On 31 March 2006, Corixa's doors closed after over 11 years in business.
