'''Rimantadine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], sold under the trade name '''Flumadine''') is an orally administered [[antiviral drug]]<ref name="pmid15561867">{{cite journal |vauthors=Govorkova EA, Fang HB, Tan M, Webster RG |title=Neuraminidase Inhibitor-Rimantadine Combinations Exert Additive and Synergistic Anti-Influenza Virus Effects in MDCK Cells |journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy |volume=48 |issue=12 |pages=4855–63 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15561867 |pmc=529183 |doi=10.1128/AAC.48.12.4855-4863.2004 |url=http://aac.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15561867}}</ref> used to treat, and in rare cases prevent, [[influenzavirus A]] infection.  When taken within one to two days of developing symptoms, rimantadine can shorten the duration and moderate the severity of influenza. Both rimantadine and the similar drug [[amantadine]] are derivates of [[adamantane]].  Rimantadine was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1994.

Rimantadine was approved for medical use in 1993.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Long|first1=Sarah S.|last2=Pickering|first2=Larry K.|last3=Prober|first3=Charles G.|title=Principles and Practice of Pediatric Infectious Disease|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=1437727026|page=1502|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nQ7-o8JAH7kC&pg=PA1502|language=en}}</ref> 100% of seasonal H3N2 and [[2009 pandemic flu]] samples tested have shown resistance to rimantadine and it is no longer recommended to prescribe for treatment of the flu.<ref>[https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6001a1.htm Antiviral Agents for the Treatment and Chemoprophylaxis of Influenza: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)]</ref>

==Medical use==
Rimantadine is believed to inhibit influenza's [[Virus#Viral replication|viral replication]], possibly by preventing the uncoating of the virus's protective shells, which are the [[Virus#Viral structure|envelope and capsid]].  Genetic studies suggest that the virus [[M2 protein]], an [[ion channel]] specified by virion M2 [[gene]], plays an important role in the susceptibility of influenza A virus to inhibition by rimantadine. Resistance to rimantadine can occur as a result of amino acid substitutions at certain locations in the transmembrane region of M2. This prevents binding of the antiviral to the channel.<ref name="pmid18669647">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Jing X, Ma C, Ohigashi Y, etal |title=Functional studies indicate amantadine binds to the pore of the influenza A virus M2 proton-selective ion channel |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=105 |issue=31 |pages=10967–72 |date=August 2008 |pmid=18669647 |pmc=2492755 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0804958105 |url=}}</ref>

Rimantadine, like its antiviral cousin [[amantadine]], possesses some [[NMDA receptor antagonist|NMDA antagonistic]] properties and is used as an antiparkinsonic drug (i.e., in the treatment of [[Parkinson's disease]]).  However, in general, neither rimantadine nor amantadine is a preferred agent for this therapy and would be reserved for cases of the disease that are less responsive to front-line treatments.

==Drug interactions==
Taking [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen, Tylenol) or [[acetylsalicylic acid]] (aspirin) while taking rimantadine is known to reduce the body's uptake of rimantadine by approximately 12%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/antivirals/influenza/flumadine.htm |title=fda.gov |work= |accessdate=2008-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050630080607/http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/antivirals/influenza/flumadine.htm |archivedate=June 30, 2005 }}</ref> [[Cimetidine]] also affects the body's uptake of rimantadine.

==Side effects==
Rimantadine can produce [[gastrointestinal]] and [[central nervous system]] [[Adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]].  Approximately 6% of patients (compared to 4% of patients taking a placebo) reported side-effects at a dosage of 200&nbsp;mg/d.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/treatment/side-effects.htm |title=<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="unique_title" -->CDC - Influenza (Flu) &#124; Antivirals: Side-Effects &#124; REMOVED!<!-- InstanceEndEditable --> |work= |accessdate=2008-11-05}}</ref> Common side effects include:

*[[nausea]]
*upset stomach
*nervousness
*tiredness
*lightheadedness
*trouble sleeping
*difficulty concentrating

== History ==
Rimantadine was discovered in 1963<ref>[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3352912.pdf US patent 3352912 to W. W. Prichard]</ref><ref>[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4551552.html United States Patent № 4551552: Process for preparing rimantadine]: ''Rimantadine and related compounds useful as antivirals were first described by Prichard in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,352,912 and 3,592,934.
