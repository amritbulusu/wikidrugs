'''Cisapride''' is a [[gastroprokinetic agent]], a [[pharmaceutical drug|drug]] that increases [[motility]] in the upper [[gastrointestinal tract]]. It acts directly as a [[serotonin]] [[5-HT4 receptor|5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor]] [[agonist]] and indirectly as a [[parasympathomimetic]]. Stimulation of the serotonin receptors increases [[acetylcholine]] release in the [[enteric nervous system]]. It has been sold under the trade names '''Prepulsid''' (Janssen-Ortho) and '''Propulsid''' (in the United States). It was discovered by [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]] in 1980.  In many countries, it has been either withdrawn from the market or had its indications limited because of side-effects.

The commercial preparations of this drug are the [[racemic]] mixture of both [[enantiomer]]s of the compound. The (+) enantiomer itself<!-- what is the absolute configuration? --> has the major pharmacologic effects and does not induce many of the detrimental side-effects of the mixture.<ref>{{US patent reference |number = 5955478 |y=  1999 |m= Sep |d= 21 | inventor = Nancy M. Gray, N. M.; Young, J. W |title= Methods for treating gastrointestinal motility dysfunction using optically pre (+) cisapride }}</ref>

==Medical uses==
Cisapride has been used for the treatment of [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] (GERD). There is no evidence it is effective for this use in children.<ref name=GERD2010>{{cite journal|last=Maclennan|first=S|author2=Augood, C |author3=Cash-Gibson, L |author4=Logan, S |author5= Gilbert, RE |title=Cisapride treatment for gastro-oesophageal reflux in children.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=Apr 14, 2010|issue=4|pages=CD002300|pmid=20393933 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002300.pub2}}</ref> It also increases gastric emptying in people with diabetic [[gastroparesis]]. Evidence for its use in [[constipation]] is not clear.<ref name=Cochrane2011>{{cite journal|last=Aboumarzouk|first=OM|author2=Agarwal, T |author3=Antakia, R |author4=Shariff, U |author5= Nelson, RL |title=Cisapride for intestinal constipation.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=Jan 19, 2011|issue=1|pages=CD007780|pmid=21249695 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007780.pub2}}</ref>

In many countries, it has been either withdrawn or had its indications limited because of reports of the side-effect [[long QT syndrome]], which may cause [[arrhythmia]]s. The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) issued a warning letter to doctors,<ref name="urlFDA UPDATES WARNINGS FOR CISAPRIDE">{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm175000.htm |title=Propulsid (cisapride) Safety Information |work= |accessdate=2011-07-14}}</ref> and cisapride was voluntarily removed from the U.S. market on July 14, 2000. Its use in Europe has also been limited.<ref name=GERD2010/> It was banned in India and in the Philippines in 2011.<ref name=ban>{{cite web|url=http://cdsco.nic.in/html/drugsbanned.html|title=Drugs banned in India|publisher=Central Drugs Standard Control Organization, Dte.GHS, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India|accessdate=2013-09-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221053621/http://cdsco.nic.in/html/drugsbanned.html|archivedate=2015-02-21|df=}}</ref>

==Veterinary uses==
Cisapride is still available in the United States and Canada for use in animals, and is commonly prescribed by veterinarians to treat [[megacolon]] in cats.

Cisapride is also commonly used to treat GI stasis in rabbits, sometimes in conjunction with [[metoclopramide]] (Reglan).

==Kinetics==
Oral bioavailability of cisapride is approximately 33%. It is inactivated primarily by hepatic metabolism by [[CYP3A4]] with a half-life of 10 hours. The dose of the drug should be reduced in case of liver diseases.<ref>[http://www.springerlink.com/content/j6m77n406404u404/ "Comparative bioavailability of a cisapride suppository and tablet formulation in healthy volunteers" European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology] T Hedner et al. Volume 38, Number 6, 629-631, {{doi|10.1007/BF00278595}}</ref>

==Pharmacology and mechanism of action==

As a [[prokinetic agent]] that increases [[gastrointestinal motility]], cisapride acts as a selective [[serotonin agonist]] in the 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor subtype. Cisapride also relieves constipation-like symptoms by indirectly stimulating the release of [[acetylcholine]] in the [[muscarinic receptor]]s.
