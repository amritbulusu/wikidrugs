'''Bethanechol''' is a [[parasympathomimetic]] [[choline]] [[carbamate]] that selectively stimulates [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor|muscarinic receptors]] without any effect on [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor|nicotinic receptors]]. Unlike [[acetylcholine]], bethanechol is not [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] by [[cholinesterase]] and will therefore have a long duration of action. 
Bethanechol is sold under the brand names Duvoid (Roberts), Myotonachol (Glenwood), Urecholine (Merck Frosst) and Urocarb (Hamilton).

== Uses ==

Bethanechol alleviates dry mouth<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The efficacy of pilocarpine and bethanechol upon saliva production in cancer patients with hyposalivation following radiation therapy|journal = Oral Surgery, Oral Medicine, Oral Pathology, Oral Radiology, and Endodontics|date = 2004-02-01|issn = 1079-2104|pmid = 14970777|pages = 190–195|volume = 97|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/S107921040300564X|first = Meir|last = Gorsky|first2 = Joel B.|last2 = Epstein|first3 = Jamie|last3 = Parry|first4 = Matthew S.|last4 = Epstein|first5 = Nhu D.|last5 = Le|first6 = Sol|last6 = Silverman}}</ref> and is sometimes given [[Wiktionary:oral|orally]] or [[subcutaneous injection|subcutaneously]] to treat [[urinary retention]] resulting from [[general anesthetic]], [[diabetic neuropathy]] of the bladder, or a side effect of [[antidepressants]]; or to treat gastrointestinal [[Atony|lack of muscular tone]]. The muscarinic receptors in the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] and [[gastrointestinal tract]] stimulate contraction of the bladder and expulsion of [[urine]], and increased gastrointestinal motility, respectively. Bethanechol should be used to treat these disorders only after mechanical obstruction is ruled out as a possible cause.

Its potential benefit in the treatment of [[cerebral palsy]] has been investigated.<ref name="pmid18759732">{{cite journal |author=Carter WJ |title=Unexpected benefits of bethanechol in adults with cerebral palsy |journal=Med. J. Aust. |volume=189 |issue=5 |pages=293 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18759732 |doi= |url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/189_05_010908/letters_010908_fm-2.html}}</ref> Bethanechol is a powerful cholinergic agent which does not cross the blood - brain barrier and may have powerful [[nootropic]] properties in enhancement of neural signaling and processing speed as well.

Atropine is given preoperatively to prevent voiding of the bowel/bladder during surgery, Bethanechol is then given postoperatively to revert this action.<ref>{{cite book|last=Obied|first=Hassan|title=Cholinergic Pharmacology|year=2011|publisher=CSU}}</ref>

== Contraindications ==

Use of bethanechol, as well as all other muscarinic receptor agonists, is contraindicated in patients with [[asthma]], [[coronary insufficiency]], [[peptic ulcer]]s, [[intestinal obstruction]] and [[hyperthyroidism]]. The parasympathomimetic action of this drug will exacerbate the symptoms of these disorders.
