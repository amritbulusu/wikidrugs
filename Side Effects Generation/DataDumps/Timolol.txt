<!-- Definition and medical uses -->
'''Timolol'''  is a medication used either by mouth or as [[eye drops]].<ref name=AHFS2016Eye/><ref name=AHFS2016PO/> As eye drops it is used to treat increased [[pressure inside the eye]] such as in [[ocular hypertension]] and [[glaucoma]].<ref name=AHFS2016Eye/> By mouth it is used for [[high blood pressure]], [[angina|chest pain due to insufficient blood flow to the heart]], to prevent further complications after a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]], and to prevent [[migraines]].<ref name=AHFS2016PO>{{cite web|title=Timolol Maleate|url=https://www.drugs.com/monograph/timolol-maleate.html|publisher=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate= 8 December 2016}}</ref>

==Medical uses==

===By mouth===
In its by mouth form, it is used:
* to treat [[hypertension|high blood pressure]]
* to prevent [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]s
* to prevent [[migraine]] headaches<ref name="MarcusBain2009">{{cite book|author1=Dawn A. Marcus|author2=Philip A. Bain|title=Effective Migraine Treatment in Pregnant and Lactating Women: A Practical Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5YWpjj89NEC&pg=PA141|accessdate=14 November 2010|date=27 February 2009|publisher=シュプリンガー・ジャパン株式会社|isbn=978-1-60327-438-8|pages=141–}}</ref>

===Eye drops===
In its eye drop form it is used to treat open-angle and, occasionally, secondary [[glaucoma]]. The mechanism of action of timolol is probably the reduction of the formation of aqueous humor in the ciliary body in the eye. It was the first β blocker approved for topical use in treatment of glaucoma in the USA (1978). When used by itself, it depresses [[intraocular pressure]] (IOP) 18–34% below baseline within first few treatments. However, there are short-term escape and long-term drift effects in some patients. That is, tolerance develops. It may reduce the extent of diurnal IOP curve up to 50%. IOP higher during sleep. It is 5–10× more potent β blocker than [[propranolol]]. Timolol is light-sensitive; it is usually preserved with 0.01% [[benzalkonium chloride]] (BAC), but also comes BAC-free. Can also be used in adjunctive therapy with [[pilocarpine]] or [[carbonic anhydrase inhibitor]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = A multicenter study comparing dorzolamide and pilocarpine as adjunctive therapy to timolol: patient preference and impact on daily life|date = Jul 1998|website = |publisher = |last = |first = |pmid=9697378 |volume=69 |issue = 7|journal=J Am Optom Assoc |pages=441–51|author1 = Strohmaier|first1 = K|last2 = Snyder|first2 = E|last3 = Adamsons|first3 = I}}</ref>

A [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane Systematic Review]] compared the effect of timolol versus [[brimonidine]] in slowing the progression of open angle glaucoma in adult participants.<ref name="Sena">{{cite journal |author=Sena DF, Lindsley K |title= Neuroprotection for treatment of glaucoma in adults |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume= |issue=1|pages= CD006539 |date=2017 |pmid= 28122126|doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD006539.pub4}}</ref>

==Side effects==
The most serious possible side effects include cardiac [[arrhythmia]]s and severe [[bronchospasm]]s. Timolol can also lead to [[Syncope (medicine)|fainting]], [[Heart failure|congestive heart failure]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[confusion]], worsening of [[Raynaud's syndrome]] and [[Erectile dysfunction|impotence]].

Side effects when given in the eye include: burning sensation, eye redness, superficial punctate keratopathy, corneal numbness.

==Formulations==
It is available in tablet and liquid formulations.

For ophthalmic use, timolol is also available combined:
* with [[carbonic anhydrase inhibitor]]s:
** timolol and [[brinzolamide]]
** [[Dorzolamide/timolol|timolol and dorzolamide]]
* with [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>2</sub>]] agonists:
** [[Brimonidine/timolol|timolol and brimonidine]] 
* with [[Prostaglandin analogue|prostaglandin analogs]]:
** [[Latanoprost/timolol|timolol and latanoprost]]
** timolol and [[travoprost]]

==Brand names==
Timolol is marketed under many [[trade name]]s worldwide.<ref name=genericnames/>
