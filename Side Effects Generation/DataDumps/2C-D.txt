'''2C-D''' ('''2,5-[[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry|di]][[methoxy]]-4-[[methyl]][[phenethylamine]]''', also known as '''2C-M''') is a [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|psychedelic drug]] of the [[2C (psychedelics)|2C family]] that is sometimes used as an [[entheogen]]. It was first synthesized in 1970 by a team from the Texas Research Institute of Mental Sciences,<ref name="pmid5412084">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ho BT, Tansey LW, Balster RL, An R, McIsaac WM, Harris RT |title=Amphetamine analogs. II. Methylated phenethylamines |journal=Journal of Medicinal Chemistry |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=134–5 |date=January 1970 |pmid=5412084 |doi= 10.1021/jm00295a034|url=}}</ref> and its activity was subsequently investigated in humans by [[Alexander Shulgin]]. The full name of the chemical is 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methyl[[phenethylamine]]. In his book ''[[PiHKAL|PiHKAL (Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved)]]'', Shulgin lists the dosage range as being from 20 to 60&nbsp;mg and many people recommend higher doses. Lower doses (generally 10&nbsp;mg or less) of 2C-D have been explored as a potential [[nootropic]], albeit with mixed results. 2C-D is generally taken orally, though may be insufflated (i.e. taken nasally). Insufflating tends to cause intense pain, however, and the dosage level is usually much lower, typically in the region of 1 to 15&nbsp;mg. 

Not much information is known about the toxicity of 2C-D, as no major studies have been conducted. According to Shulgin, the effects of 2C-D typically last for 4–6 hours. Shulgin himself referred to this substance as a “pharmacological [[tofu]],” meaning that when mixed with other substances, it can extend or potentiate their effects without coloring the experience too much, in a manner similar to how tofu absorbs the flavors of sauces or spices it is cooked with. Some people have claimed 2C-D is relatively uninteresting on its own, but many other users have strongly disagreed with this assessment and believe instead 2C-D to be a true [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] in its own right. [[Hanscarl Leuner]], working in Germany, explored the use of 2C-D under the name LE-25 in psychotherapeutic research.
