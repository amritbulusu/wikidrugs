'''2C-B-FLY''' is a [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] [[phenethylamine]] of the [[2C's|2C family]].  It was first synthesized by [[Aaron P. Monte]].

==Chemistry==
2C-B-FLY is 8-bromo-2,3,6,7-benzo-dihydro-difuran-ethylamine.  The full name of the chemical is 2-(8-bromo-2,3,6,7-tetrahydrofuro[2,3-f] [1]benzofuran-4-yl)ethanamine. It has been subject to little formal study, but its appearance as a [[designer drug]] has led the DEA to release analytical results for 2C-B-FLY and several related compounds.<ref>[http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/programs/forensicsci/microgram/journal_v5_num14/pg4.html Reed EC, Kiddon GS. The Characterization of Three FLY Compounds (2C-B-FLY, 3C-B-FLY, and Bromo-DragonFLY) ''DEA Microgram Journal''. 2007;Volume 5, Numbers 1-4]</ref>

===Analogues and derivatives===
{{2C-B analogues and derivatives}}

In theory, dihydrodifuran analogues of any of the 2Cx / DOx family of drugs could be made, and would be expected to show similar activity to the parent compound. So in the same way that 2C-B-FLY is the dihydrodifuran analogue of [[2C-B]], the 8-iodo equivalent 2C-I-FLY would be the dihydrodifuran analogue of [[2C-I]], and the 8-methyl equivalent 2C-D-FLY would be the dihydrodifuran analogue of [[2C-D]].

Other related compounds can also be produced, where the alpha carbon of the ethylamine chain is methylated, the amphetamine derivative [[DOB-FLY]] can be made, this compound being the dihydrodifuran analogue of [[2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine|DOB]], or conversely can be viewed as the saturated derivative of [[Bromo-DragonFLY]].

Where only one methoxy group of a 2Cx drug is cyclised into a dihydrofuran ring, the resulting compound is known as a "hemifly", and when an unsaturated furan ring is used, the compound is known as a "hemi-dragonfly". The larger saturated hexahydrobenzodipyran ring derivatives have been referred to as "butterfly" compounds.<!-- note that the fly/hemifly/dragonfly/butterfly naming scheme is not from the scientific papers reporting these compounds, but rather from websites such as Bluelight and Erowid which are not considered reliable sources, but nevertheless these common names have been broadly accepted by the various inventors of these compounds, and by government agencies such as the DEA --> The 8-bromo group can also be replaced by other groups to give compounds such as [[TFMFly]].

A large number of symmetrical and unsymmetrical derivatives can be produced by using different combinations of ring systems. Because the 2- and 5- positions (using phenethylamine numbering scheme, 1,5-positions if numbered as benzodifuran) are not equivalent, all unsymmetrical combinations also have two possible positional isomers, with different potencies at the various 5-HT<sub>2</sub> subtypes. Isomeric "[[Psi-DOM|Ψ]]"-derivatives with the oxygens positioned at the 2,6- positions, and [[mescaline]] analogues with the oxygens at 3,5- have also been made, but both are less potent than the corresponding 2,5- isomers.<ref name="pmid9301661">{{cite journal |author =Monte AP |title=Dihydrobenzofuran analogues of hallucinogens. 4.

==Dosage==
[[Alexander Shulgin]] lists a dosage of 2C-B-FLY at 10&nbsp;mg orally.

==Effects==
2C-B-FLY produces psychedelic effects that last 6–8 hours, or up to 12 hours in larger doses.

==Toxicity==
The toxicity of 2C-B-FLY in humans is unknown.  Two deaths occurred in October 2009, in [[Denmark]] and the [[United States]], after ingestion of a substance that was sold as 2C-B-FLY a small-time RC shop, but in fact consisted of Bromo-DragonFLY contaminated with a small amount of unidentified impurities.<ref name="Erowid">{{cite web |url=http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/2cb_fly/2cb_fly_death1.shtml |title=Erowid 2C-B-Fly Vault: Death Report }}</ref>

==Legality==

===Canada===
As of October 31, 2016; 2C-B-FLY is a controlled substance (Schedule III) in Canada. http://gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2016/2016-05-04/html/sor-dors72-eng.php

===United States===
{{globalize/US|section|date=May 2016}}
2C-B-FLY is unscheduled and uncontrolled in the United States.  However, it may fall under the scope of the [[Federal Analog Act]] if it is intended for human consumption given its similarity to [[2C-B]].

==Pharmacology==
The hallucinogenic effect of 2C-B-FLY is mediated by its partial [[agonist]]ic activity at the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> [[5-HT receptor|serotonin receptor]], but also has a high [[molecular binding|binding]] [[Chemical affinity|affinity]] for the 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1E</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> and  5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Psychedelics and the Human Receptorome | author=Thomas S.
