'''Betaxolol''' (trade names '''Betoptic''', '''Betoptic S''', '''Lokren''', '''Kerlone''') is a selective [[beta blocker|beta<sub>1</sub> receptor blocker]] used in the treatment of [[hypertension]] and [[glaucoma]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Buckley|first1=MM|last2=Goa|first2=KL|last3=Clissold|first3=SP|title=Ocular betaxolol. A review of its pharmacological properties, and therapeutic efficacy in glaucoma and ocular hypertension.|journal=Drugs|date=July 1990|volume=40|issue=1|pages=75–90|pmid=2202584|doi=10.2165/00003495-199040010-00005}}</ref> Being selective for beta<sub>1</sub> receptors, it typically has fewer systemic [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]]s than non-selective beta-blockers, for example, not causing [[bronchospasm]] (mediated by beta<sub>2</sub> receptors) as [[timolol]] may.  Betaxolol also shows greater affininty for beta<sub>1</sub> receptors than [[metoprolol]]. In addition to its effect on the heart, betaxolol reduces the pressure within the eye ([[intraocular pressure]]). This effect is thought to be caused by reducing the production of the liquid (which is called the [[aqueous humor]]) within the eye. The precise mechanism of this effect is not known. The reduction in intraocular pressure reduces the risk of damage to the [[optic nerve]] and loss of vision in patients with elevated intraocular pressure due to [[glaucoma]].

Betaxolol was approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for ocular use as a 0.5% solution ('''Betoptic''') in 1985 and as a 0.25% solution ('''Betoptic S''') in 1989.

==Clinical uses==
* Oral: for the management of hypertension
* Ophthalmic: for the management of glaucoma
* the drug seems to have an effect of neuroprotection in glaucoma treatment

==Dosage==
* Oral: The initial dose in hypertension is ordinarily 10&nbsp;mg once daily either alone or added to diuretic therapy.
* Ophthalmic: The recommended dose one to two drops in the affected eye(s) twice daily.

==Contraindications==
* Hypersensitivity to the drug
* Patients with sinus bradycardia, heart block greater than first degree, cardiogenic shock, and overt cardiac failure

==See also==
*[[Levobetaxolol]]
*[[Cicloprolol]]
