==Appearance==
The hydrochloride salt exists as a very fine, [[hygroscopic]], crystalline powder that tends to clump to itself, resembling something like powdered sugar. Its color can range from pure white to a yellowish-tan and has a slight odor that strengthens as it colors. Impurities are likely to consist of either [[pyrrolidine]] or alpha-dibrominated alkylphenones from either excess pyrrolidine or incomplete amination, respectively, during synthesis. These impurities likely account for its discoloration and fishy (pyrrolidine) or bromine-like odor, which worsens upon exposure to air, moisture, or bases.<ref name="2010BrandtS">{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/dta.204 |title=Analysis of NRG 'legal highs' in the UK: Identification and formation of novel cathinones |year=2011 |last1=Brandt |first1=S.

Other drugs with a similar chemical structure include [[alpha-pyrrolidinopropiophenone|α-pyrrolidinopropiophenone]] (α-PPP), [[4'-Methyl-α-pyrrolidinopropiophenone|4'-methyl-α-pyrrolidinopropiophenone]] (M-α-PPP), [[3',4'-Methylenedioxy-α-pyrrolidinopropiophenone|3',4'-methylenedioxy-α-pyrrolidinopropiophenone]] (MDPPP) and [[alpha-Pyrrolidinopentiophenone|1-phenyl-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-pentanone]] (α-PVP).

==Effects==
MDPV acts as a stimulant and has been reported to produce effects similar to those of [[cocaine]], [[methylphenidate]], and [[amphetamine]]s.<ref name="DEA MDPV report" />

The primary psychological effects have a duration of roughly 3 to 4 hours, with after effects such as [[tachycardia]], [[hypertension]], and mild stimulation lasting from 6 to 8 hours.<ref name="DEA MDPV report" /> High doses have been observed to cause intense, prolonged [[panic attack]]s in stimulant-intolerant users,<ref name="DEA MDPV report" /> and there are anecdotal reports of [[psychosis]] from sleep withdrawal and [[drug addiction|addiction]] at higher doses or more frequent dosing intervals.<ref name="DEA MDPV report" /> It has also been repeatedly noted for inducing irresistible [[Craving (withdrawal)|cravings]] to re-administer.<ref name="DEA MDPV report">{{cite web|url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_chem_info/mdpv.pdf | title=Report on MDPV | work=Drugs of Concern |publisher=DEA | date=May 2013}}</ref><ref name="ACMD: Consideration of the cathinones">{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/119173/acmd-cathinodes-report-2010.pdf | title=Consideration of the Cathinones | publisher=Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs | date=31 March 2010}}</ref>

Reported modalities of intake include oral consumption, [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflation]], [[smoking]], [[rectal]] and [[intravenous]] use. It is supposedly active at 3–5&nbsp;mg, with typical doses ranging between 5–20&nbsp;mg.<ref name="DEA MDPV report" />

==Long term effects==
Although there is no experience about the long-term effects of MDPV in humans, its has been reported that mice treated with MDPV during adolescence show reinforcing behavior patterns to cocaine which are higher than the control group. Also, these behavioural changes are related to alterations of factor expression directly related to addiction. All this suggests an increased vulnerability to cocaine abuse<ref>{{cite journal|last1=López-Arnau|first1=R|last2=Luján|first2=MA|last3=Duart-Castells|first3=L|last4=Pubill|first4=D|last5=Camarasa|first5=J|last6=Valverde|first6=O|last7=Escubedo|first7=E|title=Exposure of mice to MDPV during adolescence increases the psychostimulant, rewarding and reinforcing effects of cocaine in adulthood|journal=Br.

==Detection in biological specimens==

MDPV may be quantified in blood, plasma or urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma MDPV concentrations are expected to be in a range of 10–50 μg/L in persons using the drug recreationally, >50 μg/L in intoxicated patients, and >300 μg/L in victims of acute overdose.<ref>{{cite book  | author = Baselt RC  | title = Disposition of toxic drugs and chemicals in man | year = 2014 | publisher = Biomedical Publications | location = Seal Beach, Ca. | isbn = 978-0-9626523-9-4 | pages = 1321–1322 }}</ref>

==Legality==

In the UK, following the [[Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs|ACMD]]'s report on [[substituted cathinone]] derivatives,<ref name="ACMD: Consideration of the cathinones" /> MDPV is a Class B drug under The [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]] (Amendment) Order 2010, making it illegal to sell, buy, or possess without a license.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/corporate-publications-strategy/home-office-circulars/circulars-2010/010-2010/ | archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130125102358/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/corporate-publications-strategy/home-office-circulars/circulars-2010/010-2010/ | dead-url=yes | archive-date=25 January 2013 | title=A change to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 : Control of mephedrone and other cathinone derivatives | publisher=Home Office | date=16 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/1207/article/2/made | title=The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Amendment) Order 2010 | publisher=Home Office | date=12 April 2010}}</ref>

MDPV is specifically listed as a [[controlled substance]] in [[Finland]] (listed appendix IV substance as of June 28, 2010),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2010/20100596 |title=Finlex: huumausaineina pidettävistä aineista, valmisteista ja kasveista annetun valtioneuvoston asetuksen liitteen IV muuttamisesta |author=Suomen valtioneuvosto |date=28 June 2010 |work=Oikeusministeriö |publisher=Oikeusministeriö |language=Finnish |accessdate=January 25, 2011}}</ref> [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]].

===Australia===
In Western Australia, MDPV has been banned under the Poisons Act 1964, having been included in Appendix A Schedule 9 of the Poisons Act 1964 as from February 11, 2012. The [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] for [[Western Australia]] announced that anyone intending to sell or supply MDPV faces a maximum $100,000 fine or 25 years in jail. Users face a $2000 fine or two years' jail. Therefore, anyone caught with MDPV can be charged with possession, selling, supplying or intent to sell or supply.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Barnett/2012/02/Emerging-drug,-MDPV-banned-in-WA.aspx | title=Emerging drug, MDPV banned in WA | publisher=Government of Western Australia | date=8 February 2012}}</ref>

===Canada===
Canadian Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq announced on June 5, 2012 that MDPV would be listed on Schedule I of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, which was realized on September 26, 2012.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/bath-salts-drug-ingredient-banned-in-canada-1.1174926 | title='Bath salts' drug ingredient banned in Canada | date=26 September 2012 | newspaper=CBC News}}</ref>

===United States===
In the United States, MDPV is a [[DEA]] federally scheduled drug. On October 21, 2011, the DEA issued a temporary one-year ban on MDPV, classifying it as a schedule I substance. Schedule I status is reserved for those substances with a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted use for treatment in the United States and a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision.<ref name="DEA Press release">{{cite press release | url=https://www.dea.gov/pubs/pressrel/pr102111.html | title=Chemicals Used in "Bath Salts” Now Under Federal Control and Regulation | publisher=Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) | date=21 October 2011}}</ref>

Prior to the Federal ban being announced, it was already banned in Louisiana and Florida.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/2011/02/08/133399834/florida-bans-cocaine-like-bath-salts-sold-in-stores |title=Florida Bans Cocaine-Like 'Bath Salts' Sold in Stores |last=Allen |first=Greg |newspaper=[[NPR]] |date=8 February 2011}}</ref> On March 24, 2011, Kentucky passed bill HB 121 which makes MDPV, as well as three other cathinones, controlled substances in the state.

On December 8, 2011, under the Synthetic Drug Control Act, the [[US House of Representatives]] voted to ban MDPV and a variety of other synthetic drugs which had been sold legally in stores.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/house-votes-ban-fake-marijuana-fake-cocaine/story?id=15116235 | title=House Votes to Ban 'Spice,' 'Bath Salts' | date=8 December 2011 | last=Kreider | first=Randy | newspaper=ABC News}}</ref>

==Documented fatalities==
In April 2011, two weeks after they went missing, two men in northwestern Pennsylvania were found dead in a remote location on government land. The official cause of death of both men was [[hypothermia]], but toxicology reports later confirmed that both Troy Johnson, 29, and Terry Sumrow, 28, had ingested MDPV shortly before their deaths. "It wasn't anything to kill them, but enough to get them messed up," the county coroner said. MDPV containers were found in their vehicle along with spoons, hypodermic syringes and marijuana paraphernalia. In April 2011, an [[Alton, Illinois]], woman apparently died from an MDPV overdose.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/health/ct-met-bath-salts-ban-20110512-story.html | title=Illinois lawmakers target bath salts used as a drug | date=12 May 2011 | last=Wilson | first=Todd | newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}</ref>
In May 2011, The CDC reported a hospital [[emergency department]] (ED) visit after the use of "bath salts" in Michigan. One person was reported dead on arrival at the ED. Associates of the dead person reported that he had used bath salts. His toxicology results revealed high levels of MDPV in addition to marijuana and prescription drugs.

A total of 107 non-fatal intoxications and 99 analytically confirmed deaths related to MDPV between September 2009 and August 2013 were reported by nine European countries.<ref name="EMCDDA">{{cite web | url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/system/files/publications/819/TDAS14001ENN_466653.pdf | title=EMCDDA–Europol Joint Report on a new psychoactive substance: MDPV (3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone) | publisher=European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) | date=January 2014}}</ref>

==Overdose treatment==
Physicians often treat MDPV overdose cases with [[anxiolytic]]s, such as [[benzodiazepine]]s, to lessen the drug-induced activity in the brain and body.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/42451802/ns/health-health_care/t/synthetic-drugs-sent-thousands-er/ | title=Synthetic drugs sent thousands to ER | date=6 April 2011 | first1=Jim | last1=Salter | last2=Suhr | first2=Jim | newspaper=NBC News}}</ref> In some cases, general anesthesia was used because sedatives were ineffective.<ref>{{cite news | first1=Abby | last1=Goodnough | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/17/us/17salts.html | title=An Alarming New Stimulant, Legal in Many States | date=16 July 2011 | last2=Zezima | first2=Katie | newspaper=New York Times}}</ref>

Treatment in the emergency department for severe hypertension, tachycardia, agitation, or seizures consists of large doses of [[lorazepam]] in 2–4&nbsp;mg increments every 10–15 minutes intravenously or intramuscularly. If this is not effective, [[haloperidol]] is an alternative treatment. It has been found that the use of any [[beta blockers]] to treat hypertension in these patients can cause an unopposed peripheral alpha-adrenergic effect with a dangerous paradoxical rise in blood pressure.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdch/Bath_Salts_FAQ_Health_Care_Providers_April2012_v2_384317_7.pdf | title=“Bath Salts” Health Care Provider Fact Sheet | publisher=Michigan Department of Community Health | date=30 April 2012}}</ref>
