==Medical uses==
Amiodarone has been used both in the treatment of acute life-threatening arrhythmias as well as the chronic suppression of arrhythmias. It is used both in supraventricular arrhythmias and ventricular arrhythmias.

===Cardiac arrest===
[[Defibrillation]] is the treatment of choice for [[ventricular fibrillation]] (VF) and [[ventricular tachycardia]] resulting in [[cardiac arrest]]. However, amiodarone has been used in shock-refractory VF. The 2010 guidelines of the [[American Heart Association]] included amiodarone as a second line agent (after [[epinephrine]] or [[vasopressin]]).<ref name="2010AHA">{{cite journal |author=2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care |title=Part 8: Adult Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support |journal=Circulation |date=November 2010 |volume=122 |issue=18 Suppl |pages=S729–S767 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.970988 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/122/18_suppl_3/S729 |pmid=20956224 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110618091622/http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/122/18_suppl_3/S729 |archivedate=2011-06-18 |df= }}</ref> They believed that amiodarone was more effective than [[lidocaine]] in VF or pulseless [[ventricular tachycardia]].<ref name="2010AHA"/>

A 2016 review, however, found that amiodarone did not improve survival or positive outcomes in those who had a cardiac arrest.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Laina|first1=A|last2=Karlis|first2=G|last3=Liakos|first3=A|last4=Georgiopoulos|first4=G|last5=Oikonomou|first5=D|last6=Kouskouni|first6=E|last7=Chalkias|first7=A|last8=Xanthos|first8=T|title=Amiodarone and cardiac arrest: Systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=International journal of cardiology|date=9 July 2016|volume=221|pages=780–788|pmid=27434349|doi=10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.07.138}}</ref>

===Ventricular tachycardia===
Amiodarone may be used in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia in certain instances.  Individuals with hemodynamically ''unstable'' ventricular tachycardia ''should not'' initially receive amiodarone.  These individuals should be [[cardioversion|cardioverted]].

Amiodarone can be used in individuals with hemodynamically stable ventricular tachycardia.  In these cases, amiodarone can be used regardless of the individual's underlying heart function and the type of ventricular tachycardia; it can be used in individuals with [[monomorphic ventricular tachycardia]], but is contraindicated in individuals with [[polymorphic ventricular tachycardia]] as it is associated with a prolonged QT interval which will be made worse with anti-arrhythmic drugs.<ref>Resucitation Council (UK) [https://www.resus.org.uk/resuscitation-guidelines/ Peri-arrest arrhythmias - Tachycardia algorithm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103224521/https://www.resus.org.uk/resuscitation-guidelines/ |date=2016-01-03 }} Retrieved 25/01/2016</ref>

===Atrial fibrillation===
Individuals who have undergone [[coronary artery bypass surgery|open heart surgery]] are at an increased risk of developing [[atrial fibrillation]] (or AF) in the first few days post-procedure.  In the ARCH trial, [[intravenous]] amiodarone (2 g administered over 2 d) has been shown to reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation after open heart surgery when compared to placebo.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Guarnieri T, Nolan S, Gottlieb SO, Dudek A, Lowry DR |title=Intravenous amiodarone for the prevention of atrial fibrillation after open heart surgery: the Amiodarone Reduction in Coronary Heart (ARCH) trial |journal=J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=343–7 |year=1999 |pmid=10440143|doi=10.1016/S0735-1097(99)00212-0}}</ref>  However, clinical studies have failed to demonstrate long-term efficacy and have shown potentially fatal side effects such as pulmonary toxicities.  While amiodarone is not approved for AF by the FDA, it is a commonly prescribed off-label treatment due to the lack of equally effective treatment alternatives.

So-called 'acute onset atrial fibrillation', defined by the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology (NASPE) in 2003, responds well to short duration treatment with amiodarone. This has been demonstrated in seventeen randomized controlled trials, of which five included a placebo arm. The incidence of severe side effects in this group is low.

The benefit of amiodarone in the treatment of atrial fibrillation in the critical care population has yet to be determined but it may prove to be the agent of choice where the patient is hemodynamically unstable and unsuitable for DC cardioversion. It is recommended in such a role by the UK government's [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE).

==Contraindications==
Women who are [[pregnant]] or may become pregnant are strongly advised to not take amiodarone.  Since amiodarone can be expressed in breast milk, women taking amiodarone are advised to stop nursing.

It is contraindicated in individuals with [[sinus node|sinus nodal]] [[bradycardia]], [[atrioventricular node|atrioventricular]] block, and second or third degree heart block who do not have an [[artificial pacemaker]].

Individuals with baseline depressed lung function should be monitored closely if amiodarone therapy is to be initiated.

Formulations of amiodarone that contain benzyl alcohol should not be given to neonates, because the benzyl alcohol may cause the potentially fatal "gasping syndrome".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Centers for Disease Control|first1=(CDC)|title=Neonatal deaths associated with use of benzyl alcohol--United States.|journal=MMWR. Morbidity and mortality weekly report|date=11 June 1982|volume=31|issue=22|pages=290–1|pmid=6810084|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001109.htm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830225243/http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001109.htm|archivedate=30 August 2012|df=}}</ref>

Amiodarone can worsen the cardiac arrhythmia brought on by [[digitalis]] toxicity.

== Side effects ==
Amiodarone has numerous side effects. Most individuals administered amiodarone on a chronic basis will experience at least one side effect.

===Lung===
[[Image:IPF amiodarone.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|A chest X-ray demonstrating [[pulmonary fibrosis]] due to amiodarone.]]
Side effects of amiodarone include various [[pulmonary]] effects.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.drugs.com/sfx/amiodarone-side-effects.html | title = Amiodarone Side Effects | publisher = drugs.com | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160224012131/http://www.drugs.com/sfx/amiodarone-side-effects.html | archivedate = 2016-02-24 | df =  }}</ref>  The most serious reaction that is due to amiodarone is [[interstitial lung disease]].  Risk factors include high cumulative dose, more than 400 milligrams per day, duration over two months, increased age, and preexisting pulmonary disease.  Some individuals were noted to develop [[pulmonary fibrosis]] after a week of treatment, while others did not develop it after years of continuous use.  Common practice is to avoid the agent if possible in individuals with decreased lung function.

The most specific test of pulmonary toxicity due to amiodarone is a dramatically decreased [[Dlco|DL<sub>CO</sub>]] noted on [[pulmonary function test]]ing.

=== Thyroid ===
Induced abnormalities in [[thyroid]] function are common. Both under- and overactivity of the thyroid may occur.

Amiodarone is structurally similar to [[thyroxine]] and  also contains iodine. Both of these contribute to the effects of amiodarone on thyroid function.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=George M.|last2=Hunter|first2=Jennifer M.|last3=Cooper|first3=Mark S.|title=Core Topics in Endocrinology in Anaesthesia and Critical Care|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139486125|page=170|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3xd9O-W1HE8C&pg=PA170|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908192558/https://books.google.com/books?id=3xd9O-W1HE8C&pg=PA170|archivedate=2017-09-08|df=}}</ref> Amiodarone also causes an anti-thyroid action, via [[Wolff–Chaikoff effect]], due its large amount of iodine in its molecule, which causes a particular "cardiac hypothyroidism " with bradycardia and arrhythmia.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Venturi, Sebastiano|title=Evolutionary Significance of Iodine|journal=Current Chemical Biology-|volume=5 |pages=155–162|year=2011|issn=1872-3136|doi=10.2174/187231311796765012|issue=3}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Venturi, Sebastiano|title=Iodine, PUFAs and Iodolipids in Health and Disease: An Evolutionary Perspective|journal=Human Evolution-|volume= 29 |issue= 1-3|pages=185–205|year=2014|issn=0393-9375}}</ref>

Measurement of free [[thyroxine]] alone may be unreliable in detecting these problems and [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH) should therefore also be checked every 6 months.<ref>[[British National Formulary]] guidance on thyroid function monitoring ([http://www.bnf.org/bnf/bnf/49/openat/2417.htm?q=%22amiodarone%22 BNF Amiodarone])</ref>

* [[Hypothyroidism]] (slowing of the thyroid) occurs frequently; in the SAFE trial, which compared amiodarone with other medications for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, biochemical hypothyroidism (as defined by a TSH level of 4.5-10 mU/l) occurred in 25.8% of the amiodarone-treated group as opposed to 6.6% of the control group (taking placebo or [[sotalol]]). Overt hypothyroidism (defined as TSH >10 mU/l) occurred at 5.0% compared to 0.3%; most of these (>90%) were detected within the first six months of amiodarone treatment.<ref name=Batcher>{{cite journal |vauthors=Batcher EL, Tang XC, Singh BN, Singh SN, Reda DJ, Hershman JM |date=October 2007 |title=Thyroid function abnormalities during amiodarone therapy for persistent atrial fibrillation |journal=Am J Med |volume=120 |issue=10 |pages=880–85  |url=http://www.amjmed.com/article/PIIS0002934307004718/abstract | doi =10.1016/j.amjmed.2007.04.022 |pmid=17904459}}</ref>
* [[Hyperthyroidism]] (an overactive thyroid, due to the [[Jod-Basedow phenomenon|Jod-Basedow Effect]]) can also occur. However, in the SAFE trial, the increased rate of hyperthyroidism (5.3% compared to 2.4%) was not statistically significant. Most hyperthyroid patients (defined as TSH <0.35 mU/l) were asymptomatic.<ref name=Batcher/>

Thyroid uptake measurements (I-123 or I-131), which are used to differentiate causes of hyperthyroidism, are generally unreliable in patients who have been taking amiodarone.  Because of the high iodine content of amiodarone, the thyroid gland is effectively saturated, thus preventing further uptake of isotopes of iodine.  However, the radioactive iodine uptake (nuclear thyroid uptake test) may still be helpful in the diagnosis and management of amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

===Liver===
Abnormal [[liver enzyme]] results are common in patients on amiodarone. Much rarer are [[jaundice]], [[hepatomegaly]] (liver enlargement), and [[hepatitis]] (inflammation of the liver).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Flaharty KK, Chase SL, Yaghsezian HM, Rubin R |title=Hepatotoxicity associated with amiodarone therapy |journal=Pharmacotherapy |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=39–44 |year=1989 |pmid=2646621 |doi=10.1002/j.1875-9114.1989.tb04102.x}}</ref>

===Skin===
Long-term administration of amiodarone (usually more than eighteen months) is associated with a light-sensitive blue-grey discoloration of the skin; such patients should avoid exposure to the sun and use [[sunscreen]] that protects against [[ultraviolet]]-A  and -B. The discoloration will slowly improve upon cessation of the drug, however, the skin color may not return completely

===Epididymis===

Amiodarone is sometimes responsible for [[epididymitis]], a condition of the epididymis, and is normally associated with bacterial infections but which can also occur as a non-bacterial inflammatory condition. Amiodarone accumulates in the head of the organ and can cause unilateral or bilateral inflammation. It tends to resolve if amiodarone is stopped.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Thomas A, Woodard C, Rovner ES, Wein AJ |title=Urologic complications of nonurologic medications |journal=Urol. Clin.

===Cancer===
A study published in 2013 showed a possible association between amiodarone and an increased risk of cancer, especially in males, with a [[Dose–response relationship|dose-dependent]] effect.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Vincent Yi-Fong Su |author2=Yu-Wen Hu |author3=Kun-Ta Chou |title=Amiodarone and the risk of cancer |journal=Cancer |volume=119 |issue=8 |date=April 2013 | doi=10.1002/cncr.27881|display-authors=etal |pages=1699–1705}}</ref>

==Metabolism==
Amiodarone is extensively metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 3A4 and can affect the metabolism of numerous other [[medication|drugs]]. It interacts with digoxin, warfarin, phenytoin, and others. The major metabolite of amiodarone is desethylamiodarone (DEA), which also has antiarrhythmic properties.  The metabolism of amiodarone is inhibited by [[grapefruit]] juice, leading to elevated [[blood plasma|serum]] levels of amiodarone.

On August 8, 2008, the FDA issued a warning of the risk of [[rhabdomyolysis]], which can lead to [[kidney failure]] or death, when [[simvastatin]] is used with amiodarone. This interaction is dose-dependent with simvastatin doses exceeding 20&nbsp;mg. This drug combination especially with higher doses of simvastatin should be avoided.<ref name="urlInformation on Simvastatin/Amiodarone">{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/infopage/simvastatin_amiodarone/default.htm |title=Information on Simvastatin/Amiodarone |work= |accessdate=2008-09-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080921230357/http://www.fda.gov/Cder/drug/infopage/simvastatin_amiodarone/default.htm| archivedate= 21 September 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Interactions===
The [[pharmacokinetics]] of numerous [[medication|drugs]], including many that are commonly administered to individuals with [[heart]] disease, are affected by amiodarone.  Particularly, doses of [[digoxin]] should be halved in individuals taking amiodarone.

Amiodarone potentiates the action of [[warfarin]] by inhibiting the clearance of both (S) and (R) warfarin.  Individuals taking both of these medications should have their warfarin doses adjusted based off their dosing of amiodarone, and have their anticoagulation status (measured as [[prothrombin time]] (PT) and [[international normalized ratio]] (INR)) measured more frequently. Dose reduction of warfarin is as follows: 40% reduction if amiodarone dose is 400&nbsp;mg daily, 35% reduction if amiodarone dose is 300&nbsp;mg daily, 30% reduction if amiodarone dose is 200&nbsp;mg daily, and 25% reduction if amiodarone dose is 100&nbsp;mg daily.
The effect of amiodarone on the warfarin concentrations can be as early as a few days after initiation of treatment; however, the interaction may not peak for up to seven weeks.

Amiodarone inhibits the action of the [[cytochrome P450]] [[isozyme]] family. This reduces the clearance of many drugs, including the following:
* [[Ciclosporin]]
* [[Digoxin]]
* [[Flecainide]]
* [[Procainamide]]
* [[Quinidine]]
* [[Sildenafil]]
* [[Simvastatin]]

In March 2015, [[Gilead Sciences]] e-mailed warnings to health care providers about nine patients that began taking its hepatitis C drugs [[Harvoni]] (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir) or [[Sovaldi]] (sofosbuvir) along with the heart treatments amiodarone, [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]]'s [[daclatasvir|Daklinza (daclatasvir)]], or [[Johnson & Johnson]]'s [[simeprevir|Olysio (simeprevir)]] developed abnormally slow heartbeats and one died of [[cardiac arrest]]. Three required a [[pacemaker]] to be inserted. Gilead said the combinations aren't recommended and product labels will be updated.<ref>West, Stephen.

=== Excretion ===
Excretion is primarily hepatic and biliary with almost no elimination via the renal route and it is not dialyzable [Package Insert- Pacerone(R)]. Elimination half-life average of 58 days (ranging from 25–100 days [Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 21st edition]) for amiodarone and 36 days for the active metabolite, desethylamiodarone (DEA) [Package Insert- Pacerone(R)]. There is 10-50% transfer of amiodarone and DEA in the placenta as well as a presence in breast milk [Package Insert- Pacerone(R)].   Accumulation of amiodarone and DEA occurs in adipose tissue and highly perfused organs (i.e. liver, lungs) [Package Insert- Pacerone(R)], therefore, if an individual was taking amiodarone on a chronic basis, if it is stopped it will remain in the system for weeks to months.

==Mechanism of action==
Amiodarone is categorized as a class III [[antiarrhythmic agent]], and prolongs phase 3 of the [[cardiac action potential]], the repolarization phase where there is normally decreased calcium permeability and increased potassium permeability.  It has numerous other effects, however, including actions that are similar to those of antiarrhythmic classes Ia, II, and IV.

Amiodarone slows conduction rate and prolongs the refractory period of the SA and AV nodes.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=edited by Luke|last2=Williams|first2=Romeo Roncucci ; foreword by E.M. Vaughan|title=Amiodarone : pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, toxicology, clinical effects|date=1986|publisher=Médecine et sciences internationales|location=Paris|isbn=2864391252|page=12}}</ref> It also prolongs the refractory periods of the ventricles, bundles of His, and the Purkinje fibres without exhibiting any effects on the conduction rate.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=edited by Luke|last2=Williams|first2=Romeo Roncucci ; foreword by E.M.

It also shows  [[beta blocker]]-like and [[calcium channel blocker]]-like actions on the [[SA node|SA]] and [[AV node]]s, increases the refractory period via sodium- and potassium-channel effects, and slows intra-cardiac conduction of the [[cardiac action potential]], via sodium-channel effects.

Amiodarone chemically resembles [[thyroxine]] (thyroid hormone), and its binding to the nuclear thyroid receptor might contribute to some of its pharmacologic and toxic actions.<ref>Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 11th Edition.</ref>

==History==
The original observation that amiodarone's progenitor molecule, [[khellin]], had cardioactive properties, was made by the Russian physiologist [[Anrep effect|Gleb von Anrep]] while working in Cairo in 1946.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 20292400 | volume=8 | title=Ammi visnaga in the treatment of the anginal syndrome | year=1946 | journal=Br Heart J | pages=171–7 | author= Anrep GV, Barsoum GS | doi=10.1136/hrt.8.4.171}}</ref> Khellin is obtained from a plant extract of [[Khella]] or ''[[Ammi visnaga]]'', a common plant in north Africa. Anrep noticed that one of his technicians had been cured of anginal symptoms after taking khellin, then used for various, non-cardiac ailments.  This led to efforts by European pharmaceutical industries to isolate an active compound.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Amiodarone was initially developed in 1961 at the Labaz company, [[Belgium]], by chemists Tondeur and Binon, who were working on preparations derived from khellin. It became popular in Europe as a treatment for [[angina pectoris]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Deltour G, Binon F, Tondeur R |title=[Studies in the benzofuran series. VI.

As a doctoral candidate at Oxford University, Bramah Singh determined that amiodarone and [[sotalol]] had antiarrhythmic properties and belonged to a new class of antiarrhythmic agents (what would become the class III antiarrhythmic agents).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Singh BN, Vaughan Williams EM |title=The effect of amiodarone, a new anti-anginal drug, on cardiac muscle |journal=Br. J. Pharmacol. |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=657–67 |year=1970 |pmid=5485142 |doi= 10.1111/j.1476-5381.1970.tb09891.x|pmc=1702721}}</ref> Today the mechanisms of action of amiodarone and sotalol have been investigated in more detail. Both drugs have been demonstrated to prolong the duration of the [[action potential]], prolonging the refractory period, by interacting among other cellular function with [[K+ channels]].

Based on Singh's work, the [[Argentina|Argentinian]] physician Mauricio Rosenbaum began using amiodarone to treat his patients who suffered from supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, with impressive results.  Based on papers written by Rosenbaum developing Singh's theories, physicians in the [[United States]] began prescribing amiodarone to their patients with potentially life-threatening arrhythmias in the late 1970s.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rosenbaum MB, Chiale PA, Halpern MS |title=Clinical efficacy of amiodarone as an antiarrhythmic agent |journal=Am.

The FDA was reluctant to officially approve the use of amiodarone since initial reports had shown increased incidence of serious pulmonary side-effects of the drug.  In the mid-1980s, the European pharmaceutical companies began putting pressure on the FDA to approve amiodarone by threatening to cut the supply to American physicians if it was not approved.  In December 1985, amiodarone was approved by the FDA for the treatment of arrhythmias.<ref>{{cite web|title=Drug Approval Package: Cordarone (Amiodarone Hydrochloride) Tablets.

==Dosing==
Amiodarone is available in oral and intravenous formulations.

Orally, it is available under the trade names Pacerone (produced by Upsher-Smith Laboratories, Inc.) and Cordarone (produced by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories). It is also available under the trade name Aratac (produced by Alphapharm Pty Ltd) in Australia and New Zealand, and further in Australia under the brands Cardinorm and Rithmik as well as a number of generic brands.  Also Arycor in South Africa (Produced by Winthrop Pharmaceuticals.). In South America, it is known as Atlansil and is produced by Roemmers.

In India, amiodarone is marketed(produced by Cipla Pharmaceutical) under the brand name Tachyra. It is also available in intravenous ampules and vials.

The dose of amiodarone administered is tailored to the individual and the dysrhythmia that is being treated.  When administered orally, the [[bioavailability]] of amiodarone is quite variable.  Absorption ranges from 22 to 95%, with better absorption when it is given with food.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Siddoway LA |title=Amiodarone: guidelines for use and monitoring |journal=American Family Physician |volume=68 |issue=11 |pages=2189–96 |year=2003 |pmid=14677664 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20031201/2189.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515211137/http://www.aafp.org/afp/20031201/2189.html |archivedate=2008-05-15 |df= }}</ref>

== Administration ==
Amiodarone IV should be administered via a Central Venous Catheter.  It has a pH of 4.08.  If administered outside of the standard concentration of 900&nbsp;mg/500mL it should be administered using a 0.22 micron filter to prevent preciptiate from reaching the patient.  Amiodarone IV is a known vesicant. For infusions of longer than 1 hour, do not exceed concentrations of 2&nbsp;mg/mL unless a central venous catheter is used.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Infusion Nurses Society Task Force, Gorskey, et al|first=|date=January–February 2017|title=Development of an Evidence-Based List of Noncytotoxic Vesicant Medications and Solutions|url=|journal=Journal of Infusion Nurses Society|volume=40 #1|pages=26–40}}</ref>
