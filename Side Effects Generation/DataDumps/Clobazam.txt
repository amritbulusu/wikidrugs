==Medical uses==
Clobazam is used for [[epilepsy]].

It is also approved for adjunctive therapy for epilepsy in patients who have not responded to first-line drugs and in children who are refractory to first-line drugs. It is not recommended for use in children between the ages of six months and three years, unless there is a compelling need.<ref name=clobazam_anxiety_UK /> In addition to epilepsy and severe anxiety, clobazam is also approved as a short-term (2–4 weeks) adjunctive agent in [[schizophrenia]] and other [[psychotic disorder]]s to manage [[anxiety]] or [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]].<ref name=clobazam_anxiety_UK />

Clobazam is also available as an oral suspension in the UK, under the trade name of Tapclob.

Clobazam is sometimes used for refractory epilepsies. However, long-term prophylactic treatment of epilepsy has considerable drawbacks, most importantly loss of antiepileptic effects due to tolerance which may render long-term therapy ineffective.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Isojärvi |first1=JI |last2=Tokola |first2=RA |title=Benzodiazepines in the treatment of epilepsy in people with intellectual disability |journal=Journal of intellectual disability research |volume=42 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=80–92 |year=1998 |pmid=10030438}}</ref> Other antiepileptic drugs may therefore be preferred for the long-term management of epilepsy. Furthermore, benzodiazepines have the drawback, particularly after long-term use, of causing rebound seizures upon abrupt or over-rapid discontinuation of therapy forming part of the [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]].

==Contraindications==
Clobazam should be used with great care in patients with the following disorders:
*[[Myasthenia gravis]]
*[[Sleep apnea]]
*Severe [[liver]] diseases such as [[cirrhosis]] and [[hepatitis]]<ref name=clobazamliver>{{cite journal |last1=Monjanel-Mouterde |first1=Suzanne |last2=Antoni |first2=Michel |last3=Bun |first3=Hot |last4=Botta-Frindlund |first4=Danielle |last5=Gauthier |first5=André |last6=Durand |first6=Alain |last7=Cano |first7=Jean Paul |title=Pharmacokinetics of a Single Oral Dose of Clobazam in Patients with Liver Disease |journal=Pharmacology & Toxicology |volume=74 |pages=345–50 |year=1994 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0773.1994.tb01371.x |issue=4–5}}</ref>
*Severe Respiratory Insufficiency

Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with [[comorbid]] [[psychiatric disorders]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Authier |first1=N. |last2=Balayssac |first2=D. |last3=Sautereau |first3=M. |last4=Zangarelli |first4=A. |last5=Courty |first5=P. |last6=Somogyi |first6=A.A. |last7=Vennat |first7=B. |last8=Llorca |first8=P.-M. |last9=Eschalier |first9=A. |title=Benzodiazepine dependence: Focus on withdrawal syndrome |journal=Annales Pharmaceutiques Françaises |volume=67 |issue=6 |pages=408–13 |year=2009 |doi=10.1016/j.pharma.2009.07.001 |pmid=19900604 }}</ref>

==Side effects==

===Common===
Common side effects include fever, lethargy or sleepiness, drooling, and constipation.<ref name=FDAlabel>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/202067s003,203993s003lbl.pdf Clobazam label] Last updated December 2014</ref>

===Post Marketing Experience===
include other adverse reactions
*[[Urticaria]]
*[[Rash]]es

===Warnings and Precautions===
In December 2013 the FDA added warnings to the label for clobazam, that it can cause serious skin reactions, [[Stevens-Johnson syndrome]] and [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]], especially in the first 8 weeks of treatment.<ref name=SkinWarning>FDA. December 3rd, 2013 [http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/DrugSafetyPodcasts/ucm378483.htm FDA Drug Safety Podcast: FDA warns of serious skin reactions with the anti-seizure drug Onfi (clobazam) and has approved label changes]</ref>

===Drug interactions===
*[[Alcohol]] increases bioavailability by 50%
*[[Cimetidine]] increases the effects of clobazam
*[[Valproate]]

===Overdose===
Overdose and intoxication with benzodiazepine, including ONFI, may lead to CNS depression, associated with drowsiness, confusion and lethargy, possibly progressing to ataxia, respiratory depression, hypotension and rarely coma or death. The risk of a fatal outcome is increased in cases of combined poisoning with other CNS depressants, including alcohol.<ref name=inchem>Fruchtengarten L [http://www.inchem.org/documents/pims/pharm/pim921.htm Inchem - Clobazam]. Created July 1997, Reviewed 1998.</ref>

===Tolerance, dependence, and abuse potential ===
{{See also|Benzodiazepine drug misuse}}
Clobazam in animal studies has been shown to increase reward seeking behaviours which may suggest an increased risk of addictive behavioural patterns.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Thiébot |first1=Marie-Hélène |last2=Bihan |first2=Claudine |last3=Soubrié |first3=Philippe |last4=Simon |first4=Pierre |title=Benzodiazepines reduce the tolerance to reward delay in rats |journal=Psychopharmacology |volume=86 |issue=1–2 |pages=147–52 |year=1985 |pmid=2862657 |doi=10.1007/BF00431700}}</ref> Significant clobazam abuse has been reported in some countries, according to a 1983 World Health Organisation report.<ref>{{cite journal |author=WHO Review Group |year=1983 |title=Use and abuse of benzodiazepines |journal=Bull World Health Organ |volume=61 |pmid=6605211 |issue=4 |pages=551–562 |publisher=World Health Organisation |pmc=2536139}}</ref>

In humans tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of clobazam may occur<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Loiseau |first1=P |title=Benzodiazepines in the treatment of epilepsy |journal=L'Encéphale |volume=9 |issue=4 Suppl 2 |pages=287B–292B |year=1983 |pmid=6373234}}</ref> and withdrawal seizures can occur during abrupt or overrapid withdrawal.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Robertson |first1=MM |title=Current status of the 1,4- and 1,5-benzodiazepines in the treatment of epilepsy: the place of clobazam |journal=Epilepsia |volume=27 Suppl 1 |pages=S27–41 |year=1986 |pmid=3527689 |doi=10.1111/j.1528-1157.1986.tb05730.x}}</ref>

Clobazam as with other [[benzodiazepine]] drugs can lead to [[physical dependence]], [[Substance dependence|addiction]] and what is known as the [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]]. Withdrawal from clobazam or other benzodiazepines after regular use often leads to withdrawal symptoms which are similar to those seen during alcohol and [[barbiturate]] withdrawal. The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken for, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can, however, occur from standard dosages and also after short-term use{{nonspecific|date=October 2016}}. Benzodiazepine treatment should be discontinued as soon as possible via a slow and gradual dose reduction regimen.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=MacKinnon |first1=Glenda L. |last2=Parker |first2=William A. |title=Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Syndrome: A Literature Review and Evaluation |journal=The American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=19–33 |year=1982 |pmid=6133446 |doi=10.3109/00952998209002608}}</ref>

==Physical properties==
Clobazam is a 1,5-benzodiazepine, meaning that its [[diazepine]] ring has [[nitrogen]] atoms at the 1 and 5 positions (instead of the usual 1 and 4).<ref name=50years>Shorvon SD. Drug treatment of epilepsy in the century of the ILAE: the second 50 years, 1959-2009.

It is not soluble in water and is available in oral form only.<ref name=MedscapeEpilepsyDrugs/><ref name=inchem/>

==Pharmacology==
Clobazam is a GABA-A receptor agonist action and may affect sodium channels and voltage-sensitive calcium channels.<ref name=MedscapeEpilepsyDrugs>{{cite web | author=Ochoa, Juan G. | year=2005 | title=Antiepileptic Drugs: An Overview.

Like other 1,5-benzodiazepines (e.g., [[arfendazam]], [[lofendazam]], [[CP-1414S]]), the active metabolite ''N''-desmethyl-clobazam has less [[Affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for the [[Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit alpha-1|α<sub>1</sub>]] [[Protein subunit|subunit]] of the [[GABA A receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor]] compared to the 1,4-benzodiazepines.

In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial published in 1990 comparing it to [[clonazepam]], 10&nbsp;mg of clobazam was shown to be less sedating than either 0.5&nbsp;mg or 1&nbsp;mg of clonazepam.<ref name=vsclonazepam>{{cite journal |last1=Wildin |first1=JD |last2=Pleuvry |first2=BJ |last3=Mawer |first3=GE |last4=Onon |first4=T |last5=Millington |first5=L |title=Respiratory and sedative effects of clobazam and clonazepam in volunteers |journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=169–77 |year=1990 |pmid=2106335 |pmc=1380080 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.1990.tb03616.x}}</ref>

The α<sub>1</sub> subtype of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, was shown to be responsible for the sedative effects of [[diazepam]] by McKernan et al. in 2000, who also showed that its anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties could still be seen in mice whose α<sub>1</sub> receptors were insensitive to diazepam.<ref name=McKernan>{{cite journal |last1=McKernan |first1=R.

In 1996, Nakamura et al. reported that clobazam and its active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam (norclobazam), work by enhancing [[gamma-aminobutyric acid|GABA]]-activated [[chloride]] currents at GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptor-coupled [[ion channel|Cl<sup>−</sup> channel]]s. It was also reported that these effects were inhibited by the GABA [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]] [[flumazenil]], and that clobazam acts more efficiently in GABA-deficient [[brain]] tissue.<ref name=Nakamura_et_al_1996>{{cite journal |last1=Nakamura |first1=Fumihiro |last2=Suzuki |first2=Setsuo |last3=Nishimura |first3=Shigeko |last4=Yagi |first4=Kazuichi |last5=Seino |first5=Masakazu |title=Effects of Clobazam and Its Active Metabolite on GABA-Activated Currents in Rat Cerebral Neurons in Culture |journal=Epilepsia |volume=37 |issue=8 |pages=728–35 |year=1996 |pmid=8764810 |doi=10.1111/j.1528-1157.1996.tb00643.x}}</ref>
