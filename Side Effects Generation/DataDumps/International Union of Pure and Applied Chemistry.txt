==Creation and history==
[[File:Frkekulé.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A black and white image of a bald man in a dark outfit, with a bushy white beard and moustache|Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz]]

The need for an international standard for chemistry was first addressed in 1860 by a committee headed by German scientist [[Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz]]. This [[working group|committee]] was the first international conference to create an international naming system for [[organic compounds]].<ref name="History of IUPAC"/> The ideas that were formulated in that conference evolved into the official [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry]].<ref name="History of IUPAC"/> IUPAC stands as a legacy of this meeting, making it one of the most important historical international collaborations of [[list of chemistry societies|chemistry societies]].<ref name="History of IUPAC"/> Since this time, IUPAC has been the official organization held with the responsibility of updating and maintaining official [[organic nomenclature]].<ref name="Chemistry The Central Science">{{Cite book|last= Brown |first= Theodore L. |author2= H.

During World War II, IUPAC was affiliated with the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]], but had little involvement during the war effort itself. After the war, [[East Germany|East]] and [[West Germany]] were eventually readmitted to IUPAC.<ref name="Wissenschaften und Wissenschaftspolitik: Bestandsaufnahmen zu Formationen, Brüchen und Kontinuitäten im Deutschland des 20.

In 2016, IUPAC denounced the use of [[chlorine]] as a [[chemical weapon]]. The organization pointed out their concerns in a letter to Ahmet Üzümcü, the director of the [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons]] (OPCW), in regards to the practice of utilizing chlorine for [[Syrian Civil War|weapon usage in Syria]] among other locations. The letter stated, "Our organizations deplore the use of chlorine in this manner. The indiscriminate attacks, possibly carried out by a member state of the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] (CWC), is of concern to chemical scientists and engineers around the globe and we stand ready to support your mission of implementing the CWC." According to the CWC, "the use, stockpiling, distribution, development or storage of any chemical weapons is forbidden by any of the 192 state party signatories."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/biological-threats/bioterrorism/20344-international-chemical-industry-condemns-use-chlorine-weapon/|title=International chemical industry condemns the use of chlorine as a weapon|last=|first=|date=2016-12-01|work=|newspaper=Homeland Preparedness News|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-08|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901014921/https://homelandprepnews.com/biological-threats/bioterrorism/20344-international-chemical-industry-condemns-use-chlorine-weapon/|archivedate=1 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Committees and governance==
IUPAC is governed by several committees that all have different responsibilities. The committees are as follows: Bureau, CHEMRAWN (Chem Research Applied to World Needs) Committee, Committee on Chemistry Education, Committee on Chemistry and Industry, Committee on Printed and Electronic Publications, Evaluation Committee, Executive Committee, Finance Committee, Interdivisional Committee on Terminology, Nomenclature and Symbols, Project Committee, and Pure and Applied Chemistry Editorial Advisory Board.<ref name="governing committees"/> Each committee is made up of members of different National Adhering Organizations from different countries.<ref name="nao"/>

==Nomenclature==
{{main|Preferred IUPAC name}}
IUPAC committee has a long history of officially naming [[Organic compound|organic]] and [[inorganic compound]]s. [[IUPAC nomenclature]] is developed so that any compound can be named under one set of standardized rules to avoid duplicate names. The first publication, which is information from the International Congress of Applied Chemistry,<ref name="publications">[http://www.iupac.org/indexes/books/years/1900 IUPAC Publications List] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509232007/http://www.iupac.org/indexes/books/years/1900 |date=9 May 2010 }} retrieved 15 April 2010</ref> on [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry|IUPAC nomenclature of organic compounds]], can be found from the early 20th century in ''A Guide to IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds'' (1900).

===Organic nomenclature===
IUPAC organic nomenclature has three basic parts: the [[substituents]], [[carbon chain]] length and chemical ending.<ref name="Chemistry The Central Science"/> The substituents are any functional groups attached to the main carbon chain. The main carbon chain is the longest possible continuous chain. The chemical ending denotes what type of molecule it is. For example, the ending ''ane'' denotes a single bonded carbon chain, as in "hexane" ({{chem|C|6|H|14}}).<ref name="Organic Chemistry I As a Second Language: Translating the Basic Concepts">{{Cite book|last= Klein |first= David R. |title= Organic Chemistry I As a Second Language: Translating the Basic Concepts Second Edition |publisher= John Wiley & Sons Inc. |year= 2008 |isbn=978-0-470-12929-6}}</ref>

Another example of IUPAC organic nomenclature is [[cyclohexanol]]:

[[File:Cyclohexanol acsv.svg|thumb|150px|center|Cyclohexanol]]
* The substituent name for a [[ring compound]] is ''cyclo''.
* The indication (substituent name) for a six [[carbon chain]] is ''hex''.
* The chemical ending for a single bonded carbon chain is ''ane''
* The chemical ending for an [[alcohol]] is ''ol''
* The two chemical endings are combined for an ending of ''anol'' indicating a single bonded carbon chain with an alcohol attached to it.<ref name="Chemistry The Central Science"/><ref name="Organic Chemistry I As a Second Language: Translating the Basic Concepts"/><ref name="Gold Book second edition">{{cite web |url=http://old.iupac.org/publications/compendium/ |title=Gold Book web page |publisher=Old.iupac.org |date=19 October 2006 |accessdate=8 June 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525165659/http://old.iupac.org/publications/compendium/ |archivedate=25 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===Inorganic nomenclature===
Basic IUPAC inorganic nomenclature has two main parts: the [[cation]] and the [[anion]]. The cation is the name for the positively charged [[ion]] and the anion is the name for the negatively charged ion.<ref name="Chemistry The Central Science"/>

An example of IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry is [[potassium chlorate]] (KClO<sub>3</sub>):

[[File:Potassium-chlorate-composition.png|thumb|150px|center|Potassium chlorate]]
* "[[Potassium]]" is the cation name.
* "[[Chlorate]]" is the anion name.<ref name="Chemistry The Central Science"/>

==Amino acid and nucleotide base codes==
IUPAC also has a system for giving codes to identify [[amino acid]]s and [[nucleotide]] bases. IUPAC needed a coding system that represented long sequences of amino acids. This would allow for these sequences to be compared to try to find [[homologies]].<ref name="Amino Acid">[http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/misc/naabb.html Amino Acid Codes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205191106/http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/misc/naabb.html |date=5 February 2007 }} retrieved 15 April 2010</ref> These codes can consist of either a one letter code or a three letter code.

These codes make it easier and shorter to write down the amino acid sequences that make up [[protein]]s. The nucleotide bases are made up of [[purines]] ([[adenine]] and [[guanine]]) and [[pyrimidines]] ([[cytosine]] and [[thymine]] or [[uracil]]). These nucleotide bases make up [[DNA]] and [[RNA]]. These nucleotide base codes make the genome of an organism much smaller and easier to read.<ref name="Amino">[http://www.ebi.ac.uk/2can/tutorials/aa.html Amino Acid and Nucleotide Base Codes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712133614/http://www.ebi.ac.uk/2can/tutorials/aa.html |date=12 July 2009 }} retrieved 15 April 2010</ref>
