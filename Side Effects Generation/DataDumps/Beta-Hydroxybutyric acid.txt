'''β-Hydroxybutyric acid''', also known as '''3-hydroxybutyric acid''', is an organic compound and a [[beta hydroxy acid]] with the formula CH<sub>3</sub>CH(OH)CH<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H; its [[conjugate base]] is '''''beta''-hydroxybutyrate''', also known as '''3-hydroxybutyrate'''. β-Hydroxybutyric acid is a [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] compound having two [[enantiomers]], <small>D</small>-β-hydroxybutyric acid and <small>L</small>-β-hydroxybutyric acid. Its oxidized and polymeric derivatives occur widely in nature.

==Biosynthesis==
In humans, <small>D</small>-3-hydroxybutyrate is synthesized in the [[liver]] from acetoacetate, the first ketone produced in the fasting state.  The biosynthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme [[3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase|beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase]].

''beta''-hydroxybutyrate's concentration, as with other [[ketone bodies]], is raised in [[ketosis]].<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2087381-overview#a4 Beta-Hydroxybutyrate]. Medscape. Retrieved 2017-02-08. http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2087381-overview#a4 </ref> This elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate level is naturally expected, as beta-hydroxybutyrate is formed from acetoacetate. The compound can be used as an energy source by the brain when blood [[glucose]] is low.<ref>{{cite journal|author=O. E. Owen|title=Brain Metabolism during Fasting|journal=The Journal of Clinical Investigation|volume=46|issue=10|year=1967|pages=1589–1595|pmid=6061736|doi=10.1172/JCI105650|pmc=292907|display-authors=etal}}</ref>  [[Diabetic]] patients can have their ketone levels tested via urine or blood to indicate [[diabetic ketoacidosis]].  In alcoholic ketoacidosis, this ketone body is produced in greatest concentration.  Ketogenesis occurs if [[oxaloacetate]] in the liver cells is depleted, a circumstance created by reduced carbohydrate intake (through diet or starvation), prolonged, excessive alcohol consumption, and/or insulin deficiency. Because oxaloacetate is crucial for entry of [[Acetyl-CoA]] into the TCA cycle, the rapid production of Acetyl-CoA from fatty acid oxidation in the absence of ample oxaloacetate overwhelms the decreased capacity of the TCA cycle, and the resultant excess of Acetyl-CoA is shunted towards ketone body production.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Biological activity==
β-Hydroxybutyric acid is able to cross the [[blood-brain-barrier]] into the [[central nervous system]].<ref name="pmid27253067">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sleiman SF, Henry J, Al-Haddad R, El Hayek L, Abou Haidar E, Stringer T, Ulja D, Karuppagounder SS, Holson EB, Ratan RR, Ninan I, Chao MV |title=Exercise promotes the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) through the action of the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate |journal=Elife |volume=5 |issue= |pages= |year=2016 |pmid=27253067 |pmc=4915811 |doi=10.7554/eLife.15092 |url=}}</ref> Levels of β-hydroxybutyric acid increase in the [[liver]], [[heart]], [[muscle]], [[brain]], and other tissues with [[exercise]], [[calorie restriction]], [[fasting]], and [[ketogenic diet]]s.<ref name="pmid27253067" /> The compound has been found to act as a [[histone deacetylase inhibitor|histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor]].<ref name="pmid27253067" /> Through inhibition of the HDAC class I [[isoenzyme]]s [[HDAC2]] and [[HDAC3]], β-hydroxybutyric acid has been found to increase [[brain-derived neurotrophic factor]] (BDNF) levels and [[TrkB]] [[cell signaling|signaling]] in the [[hippocampus]].<ref name="pmid27253067" /> Moreover, it has been determined that β-hydroxybutyric acid mediates the effects of exercise on BDNF levels in the hippocampus.<ref name="pmid27253067" /> These findings may have clinical relevance in the treatment of [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], and [[cognitive impairment]].<ref name="pmid27253067" />

In [[epilepsy]] patients on the ketogenic diet, blood β-hydroxybutyrate levels correlate best with degree of [[seizure]] control. The threshold for optimal [[anticonvulsant]] effect appears to be approximately 4&nbsp;mmol/L.<ref name="pmid11198492">{{cite journal | vauthors=Gilbert DL, Pyzik PL, Freeman JM | title=The ketogenic diet: seizure control correlates better with serum beta-hydroxybutyrate than with urine ketones | journal= JOURNAL OF CHILD NEUROLOGY | volume=15 | issue=3 | pages=787-790 | year=2000  | doi= 10.1177/088307380001501203 | PMID = 11198492 }}</ref>

==Laboratory and industrial chemistry==
''beta''-Hydroxybutyric acid is the precursor to polyesters, which are [[biodegradable plastics]].  Known as [[Polyhydroxybutyrate|poly(3-hydroxybutyrate)]], this polymer is also produced biologically by the bacteria ''[[Alcaligenes eutrophus]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Yoshiharu Doi |author2=Masao Kunioka |author3=Yoshiyuki Nakamura |author4=Kazuo Soga | title = Nuclear magnetic resonance studies on unusual bacterial copolyesters of 3-hydroxybutyrate and 4-hydroxybutyrate | journal = Macromolecules | year = 1988 | volume = 21 | issue = 9 | pages = 2722–2727 | doi=10.1021/ma00187a012}}</ref>

''beta''-Hydroxybutyrate can be extracted from poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) by acid [[hydrolysis]].<ref>Dieter Seebach, Albert K. Beck, Richard Breitschuh, and Kurt Job "Direct Degradation of the Biopolymer Poly[(R)-3-Hydroxybutrric Acid to (R)-3-Hydroxybutanoic Acid and Its Methyl Ester" Org. Synth. 1993, 71, 39. {{DOI|10.15227/orgsyn.071.0039}}</ref>

Blood beta-hydroxybutyrate levels are measured through a test that uses beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, with NAD+ as an electron-accepting cofactor.  The conversion of B-OHB to acetoacetate catalyzed by the enzyme reduces the NAD+ to NADH, generating an electrical change, the magnitude of which can then be used to extrapolate the amount of beta-hydroxybutyrate in the sample.
