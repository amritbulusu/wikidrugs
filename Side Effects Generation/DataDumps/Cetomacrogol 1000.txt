'''Cetomacrogol 1000''' is the [[tradename]] for '''polyethylene glycol hexadecyl ether''', which is [[nonionic surfactant]] produced by the [[ethoxylation]] of [[cetyl alcohol]] to give a material with the general formula HO(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O)<sub>''n''</sub>C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>33</sub>. Several grades of this material are available depending of the level of ethoxylation performed, with [[repeat unit]]s (''n'') of [[polyethylene glycol]] varying between 2 and 20. If n=20 it is named Brij58. If n=10, it is named Brij56.
It is used as a solubilizer and [[emulsifying agent]] in foods, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals, often as an ointment base, and also as a research tool. It is used as O/W emulsifier for creams/lotions; Wetting agent in sticks; Conforms to BP specifications. Use 0.5-5%.
