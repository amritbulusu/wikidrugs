'''Flunitrazolam''' is a [[benzodiazepine]] derivative that has been sold online as a [[designer drug]], and is a potent [[hypnotic]] and [[sedative]] drug similar to related compounds such as [[flunitrazepam]], [[clonazolam]] and [[flubromazolam]]. It was first definitively identified and reported to the [[EMCDDA]] Early Warning System, by an analytical laboratory in Germany in October 2016,<ref>[https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/tdan17001enn_pdfweb.pdf Europol 2016 Annual Report on the implementation of Council Decision 2005/387/JHA]</ref> and had not been described in the scientific or patent literature before this.<ref>Manchester KR, Lomas EC, Waters L, Dempsey FC, Maskell PD.
