'''Phenacetin''' (or '''acetophenetidin''') is a [[analgesic|pain-relieving]] and [[antipyretic|fever-reducing]] drug, which was widely used between its introduction in 1887 and the 1983 ban imposed by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/Over-the-CounterOTCDrugs/StatusofOTCRulemakings/UCM078577.pdf|title=Drugs withdrawn from the market containing phenacetin|publisher=FDA, Department of Health and Human Services}}</ref>

==History==
Phenacetin was introduced in 1887 in [[Elberfeld]] by German company [[Bayer]], and was used principally as an analgesic; it was one of the first synthetic fever reducers to go on the market. It is also known historically to be one of the first non-[[opioid]] analgesics without anti-inflammatory properties.

==Known mechanism of action==
Its analgesic effects are due to its actions on the sensory tracts of the spinal cord. In addition, phenacetin has a depressant action on the heart, where it acts as a negative [[inotrope]]. It is an [[antipyretic]], acting on the brain to decrease the temperature set point. It is also used to treat [[rheumatoid arthritis]] (subacute type) and intercostal [[neuralgia]].

It is metabolized in the body as [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen), which is also a clinically relevant analgesic.

==Preparation==
The first synthesis was reported in 1878 by [[Harmon Northrop Morse]].<ref>{{cite journal

Phenacetin may be synthesized as an example of the [[Williamson ether synthesis]]: [[ethyl iodide]], [[paracetamol]], and anhydrous [[potassium carbonate]] are refluxed in [[2-butanone]] to give the crude product, which is recrystallized from water.<ref>{{cite web | title = Conversion of Acetaminophen into Phenacetin | publisher = [[California State University Stanislaus]] | work = Chemistry Department Master Experiment Archive | url = http://wwwchem.csustan.edu/archive/Phenacetin.htm}}</ref>

==Analogs==
#[[Lactylphenetidin]].
#[[Bucetin]] Analgesic. Weak mutagen, less mutagenic than phenacetin.
#[[Butacetin]]
#[[Methacetin]]

==Uses==
[[File:Vicks Double-Buffered Cold Tablets.jpg|left|thumb|Vicks cold tablets, containing: salicylamide, phenacetin 2½ grs., pyrilamine maleate, caffeine, ephedrine sulphate, magnesium hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide complex (U.S. Pat. 2,446,981). That patent number is from 1948; these tablets would have been made shortly thereafter.]]
Phenacetin was widely used until the third quarter of the twentieth century, often in the form of an '''"A.P.C."''' or [[aspirin]]-phenacetin-[[caffeine]] [[compound analgesic]], as a remedy for fever and pain. An early formulation (1919) was [[Vincent's APC]] in Australia. However the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] ordered the withdrawal of drugs containing phenacetin in November 1983, owing to its [[carcinogen]]ic and kidney-damaging properties (Federal Register of October 5, 1983 (48 FR 45466)). It was also banned in India.<ref name=ban>{{cite web|url=http://cdsco.nic.in/html/drugsbanned.html|title=Drugs banned in India|publisher=Central Drugs Standard Control Organization, Dte.GHS, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India|accessdate=2013-09-17}}</ref> As a result, some branded, previously phenacetin-based preparations continued to be sold, but with the phenacetin replaced by safer alternatives. A popular brand of phenacetin was [[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche]]'s [[Saridon]], which was reformulated in 1983 to contain [[propyphenazone]], [[paracetamol]] and [[caffeine]]. [[Coricidin]] was also reformulated without phenacetin. Paracetamol is a metabolite of phenacetin with similar analgesic and antipyretic effects, but the new formulation has not been found to have phenacetin's carcinogenicity.

Phenacetin is now being used as a [[cutting agent]] to adulterate [[cocaine]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Canada]], owing to the similar physical features of the two drugs.<ref>{{cite news | publisher = [[BBC News]] | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6178026.stm | title = Cancer chemical in street cocaine | date=  23 November 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Luba|first1=Frank|title=Used cocaine lately?

Due to low-cost phenacetin is used for research into the physical and refractive properties of crystals. It is an ideal compound for this type of research.<ref>http://www.opticsinfobase.org/josaa/abstract.cfm?uri=josaa-17-6-1012</ref><ref>http://www.turpion.org/php/paper.phtml?journal_id=qe&paper_id=556</ref>

==Safety==
Phenacetin, and products containing phenacetin, have been shown in an [[animal model]] to have the side effect and after-effect of [[carcinogenesis]]. In humans, many case reports have implicated products containing phenacetin in urothelial neoplasms, especially [[urothelial carcinoma]] of the [[renal pelvis]]. In one prospective series, phenacetin was associated with an increased risk of death due to urologic or renal diseases, death due to cancers, and death due to cardiovascular diseases.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199101173240304 |vauthors=Dubach U, Rosner B, Stürmer T | title = An epidemiologic study of abuse of analgesic drugs. Effects of phenacetin and salicylate on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity (1968 to 1987) | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 324 | issue = 3 | pages = 155–60 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1984193}}</ref>
In addition, people with [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]] may experience acute [[hemolysis]], or dissolution of blood cells, while taking this drug. Acute hemolysis is possible in the case of patients who develop an [[IgM]] response to phenacetin leading to immune complexes that bind to [[erythrocytes]] in blood. The erythrocytes are then lysed when the complexes activate the [[complement system]].

Chronic use of phenacetin is known to lead to [[analgesic nephropathy]] characterized by [[renal papillary necrosis]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cochran A, Lawson D, Linton A | title = Renal papillary necrosis following phenacetin excess | journal = Scott Med J | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = 246–50 | year = 1967 | pmid = 6036245}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Tan G, Rabbino M, Hopper J | title = Is Phenacetin a Nephrotoxin?: A Report on Twenty-three Users of the Drug | journal = Calif Med | volume = 101 | issue = 2| pages = 73–7 | year = 1964 | pmid = 14180501 | pmc = 1515485}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Brix A | title = Renal papillary necrosis | journal = Toxicol Pathol | volume = 30 | issue = 6 | pages = 672–4 | year = 2002| pmid = 12512867 | doi = 10.1080/01926230290166760}}</ref> This is a condition which results in destruction of some or all of the [[renal papilla]]e in the kidneys.

One notable death that can possibly be attributed to the use of this drug was that of the aviation pioneer [[Howard Hughes]]. He had been using phenacetin extensively for the treatment of [[chronic pain]]; it was stated during his autopsy that phenacetin use may have been the cause of his [[kidney failure]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tennant |first=Forest |date=July{{ndash}}August 2007 |title=Howard Hughes & Pseudoaddiction |url=http://www.foresttennant.com/pdfs/HowardHughes.pdf |journal=Practical Pain Management |publisher=PPM Communications |volume=7 |issue=6 |page=20 |access-date=2 November 2015 |quote=The phenacetin in the codeine compound produced, over time, kidney failure and death.}}</ref>
