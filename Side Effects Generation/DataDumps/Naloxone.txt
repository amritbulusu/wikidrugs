=== Opioid overdose ===
[[File:NaloxoneKit.jpg|thumb|A naloxone kit as distributed in British Columbia, Canada]]
Naloxone is useful both in acute [[opioid overdose]] and in reducing respiratory or mental depression due to opioids.<ref name=AHFS2015/> Whether it is useful in those in [[cardiac arrest]] due to an opioid overdose is unclear.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lavonas|first1=EJ|last2=Drennan|first2=IR|last3=Gabrielli|first3=A|last4=Heffner|first4=AC|last5=Hoyte|first5=CO|last6=Orkin|first6=AM|last7=Sawyer|first7=KN|last8=Donnino|first8=MW|title=Part 10: Special Circumstances of Resuscitation: 2015 American Heart Association Guidelines Update for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care.|journal=Circulation|date=3 November 2015|volume=132|issue=18 Suppl 2|pages=S501-18|pmid=26472998|doi=10.1161/cir.0000000000000264}}</ref>

=== Preventing opioid abuse ===
Naloxone is poorly absorbed when taken by mouth, so it is commonly combined with a number of oral opioid preparations, including [[buprenorphine]] and [[pentazocine]], so that when taken orally, just the opioid has an effect, but if misused by injecting, the naloxone blocks the effect of the opioid.<ref name=AHFS2015/><ref name=Orman2009>{{cite journal|last1=Orman|first1=JS|last2=Keating|first2=GM|title=Buprenorphine/naloxone: a review of its use in the treatment of opioid dependence.|journal=Drugs|date=2009|volume=69|issue=5|pages=577–607|pmid=19368419|doi=10.2165/00003495-200969050-00006}}</ref> This combination is used in an effort to prevent abuse.<ref name=Orman2009/>

===Other===
In a meta-analysis of people with [[circulatory shock|shock]], including [[septic shock|septic]], cardiogenic, hemorrhagic, or spinal shock, those who received naloxone had improved blood flow. The importance of this is unclear.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Boef|first=B|author2=Poirier V |author3=Gauvin F |author4=Guerguerian AM |author5=Roy C |author6=Farrell CA |author7=Lacroix J |title=Naloxone for shock.|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev.|date=2003|issue=4|pmid=14584016|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004443 |pages=CD004443}}</ref>

Naloxone is also experimentally used in the treatment for [[congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis]], an extremely rare disorder (one in 125 million) that renders one unable to feel pain or differentiate temperatures.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Naloxone can also be used as an antidote in overdose of [[clonidine]], a medication that lowers blood pressure.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Niemann|first1=JT|last2=Getzug|first2=T|last3=Murphy|first3=W|title=Reversal of clonidine toxicity by naloxone.|journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine|date=October 1986|volume=15|issue=10|pages=1229–31|pmid=3752658|doi=10.1016/s0196-0644(86)80874-5}}</ref>

In Germany, [[tilidine]] is sold in a fixed combination with&nbsp;naloxone.

== Side effects ==
Naloxone has little to no effect if opioids are not present. In people with opioids in their system, it may cause increased sweating, nausea, restlessness, trembling, vomiting, flushing, and headache, and has in rare cases been associated with heart rhythm changes, [[seizures]], and [[pulmonary edema]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drugs.com/sfx/naloxone-side-effects.html |title=Naloxone Side Effects in Detail |website=Drugs.com |accessdate=5 May 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507072325/http://www.drugs.com/sfx/naloxone-side-effects.html |archivedate=7 May 2015 |df= }}</ref><ref name="pmid3662194">{{cite journal |vauthors=Schwartz JA, Koenigsberg MD | title = Naloxone-induced pulmonary edema | journal = Ann Emerg Med | volume = 16 | issue = 11 | pages = 1294–6 |date=November 1987  | pmid = 3662194 | doi = 10.1016/S0196-0644(87)80244-5 }}</ref>

Naloxone has been shown to block the action of pain-lowering [[endorphin]]s which the body produces naturally. These endorphins likely operate on the same opioid receptors that naloxone blocks. It is capable of blocking a [[placebo]] pain-lowering response, both in clinical and experimental pain, if the placebo is administered together with a hidden or blind injection of naloxone.<ref name="pmid15820838">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sauro MD, Greenberg RP | title = Endogenous opiates and the placebo effect: a meta-analytic review | journal = J Psychosom Res | volume = 58 | issue = 2 | pages = 115–20 |date=February 2005  | pmid = 15820838 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2004.07.001 }}</ref> Other studies have found that placebo alone can activate the body's μ-opioid endorphin system, delivering pain relief by the same receptor mechanism as morphine.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Special populations==

===Pregnancy and breast feeding===
Naloxone is [[pregnancy category]] B or C in the United States.<ref name=AHFS2015/> Studies in rodents given a daily maximum dose of 10&nbsp;mg naloxone showed no harmful effects to the fetus, although human studies are lacking and the drug does cross the [[placenta]], which may lead to the precipitation of withdrawal in the fetus. In this setting, further research is needed before safety can be assured, so naloxone should only be used during pregnancy if it is a medical necessity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sobor|first=M |author2=Timar, J. |author3=Riba, P. |author4=Kiraly, KP.|title=Behavioural studies during the gestational-lactation period in morphine treated rats|journal=Neuropsychopharmacol Hung|date=2013|volume=15|issue=4|pages=239–251|pmid=24380965}}</ref>

Whether naloxone is excreted in [[breast milk]] is unknown.

===Kidney and liver dysfunction===
Currently, no established clinical trials have been conducted in person with insufficient kidney function or liver disease, and as such, these people should be monitored closely if naloxone is clinically indicated.

==Pharmacodynamics==
Naloxone has an extremely high affinity for [[μ-opioid receptor]]s in the [[central nervous system]] (CNS). Naloxone is a μ-opioid receptor (MOR) [[inverse agonist]],<ref name="Sirohi et al. 2009">{{cite journal|last1=Sirohi|first1=S.|last2=Dighe|first2=S. V.|last3=Madia|first3=P. A.|last4=Yoburn|first4=B. C.|title=The Relative Potency of Inverse Opioid Agonists and a Neutral Opioid Antagonist in Precipitated Withdrawal and Antagonism of Analgesia and Toxicity|journal=Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics|date=12 May 2009|volume=330|issue=2|pages=513–519|doi=10.1124/jpet.109.152678|pmid=19435929|pmc=2713087}}</ref> and its rapid blockade of those receptors often produces rapid onset of [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms. Naloxone also has an antagonist action, though with a lower affinity, at [[kappa Opioid receptor|κ-]] (KOR) and [[delta Opioid receptor|δ-opioid receptors]] (DOR). If administered in the absence of concomitant opioid use, no functional pharmacological activity occurs (except the inability for the body to combat pain naturally). In contrast to direct opiate agonists, which  elicit opiate withdrawal symptoms when discontinued in opiate-tolerant people, no evidence indicates the development of tolerance or dependence on naloxone.  The mechanism of action is not completely understood, but studies suggest it functions to produce withdrawal symptoms by competing for opiate receptor sites within the CNS (a competitive antagonist, not a direct agonist), thereby preventing the action of both [[endogenous]] and [[xenobiotic]] opiates on these receptors without directly producing any effects itself.<ref name="Daily Med">{{cite web|title=NALOXONE HYDROCHLORIDE injection, solution|url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=8535cc84-ad4a-4d67-8480-fb5a2e3406f8|publisher=Daily Med|accessdate=21 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422232959/http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=8535cc84-ad4a-4d67-8480-fb5a2e3406f8|archivedate=22 April 2014|df=}}</ref>

The K<sub>i</sub> [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] values of (−)-naloxone for the MOR, KOR, and DOR have been reported as 0.559 nM, 4.91 nM, and 36.5 nM, respectively, whereas for (+)-naloxone, 3,550 nM, 8,950 nM, and 122,000 nM, respectively, have been reported.<ref name="pmid7562497">{{cite journal |vauthors=Codd EE, Shank RP, Schupsky JJ, Raffa RB | title = Serotonin and norepinephrine uptake inhibiting activity of centrally acting analgesics: structural determinants and role in antinociception | journal = J.

==Pharmacokinetics==
When administered [[wikt:parenteral|parenterally]] (nonorally or nonrectally, e.g. intravenously or by injection), as is most common, naloxone has a rapid distribution throughout the body.  The mean serum half life has been shown to range from 30 to 81 minutes, shorter than the average half life of some opiates, necessitating repeat dosing if opioid receptors must be stopped from triggering for an extended period.  Naloxone is primarily metabolized by the liver.  Its major metabolite is naloxone-3-glucuronide, which is excreted in the urine.<ref name="Daily Med"/>

==Administration==
Naloxone is most commonly injected [[intravenously]] for fastest action, which usually causes the drug to act within a minute, and lasts up to 45 minutes. It can also be administered via [[intramuscular]], subcutaneous injection, or nasal spray.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title = DailyMed - NARCAN- naloxone hydrochloride spray|url = http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=724df050-5332-4d0a-9a5f-17bf08a547e1|website = dailymed.nlm.nih.gov|access-date = 2016-01-22|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160130063652/http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=724df050-5332-4d0a-9a5f-17bf08a547e1|archivedate = 2016-01-30|df = }}</ref> There is a pre packaged nasal spray that does not require assembly and delivers a consistent dose.

If minimal or no response is observed within 2–3 minutes, dosing may be repeated every 2 minutes until the maximum dose of 10&nbsp;mg has been reached. If no response occurs at this time, alternative diagnosis and treatment should be pursued. If people show a response, they should remain under close monitoring; the effects of naloxone may wear off before those of the opioids, and they may require repeat dosing at a later time.

In April 2014, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved a hand-held automatic injector naloxone product that is pocket-sized and can be used in nonmedical settings such as in the home.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lavonas|first1=EJ|last2=Drennan|first2=IR|last3=Gabrielli|first3=A|last4=Heffner|first4=AC|last5=Hoyte|first5=CO|last6=Orkin|first6=AM|last7=Sawyer|first7=KN|last8=Donnino|first8=MW|title=Part 10: Special Circumstances of Resuscitation: 2015 American Heart Association Guidelines Update for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care.|journal=Circulation|date=3 November 2015|volume=132|issue=18 Suppl 2|pages=S501-18|pmid=26472998|doi=10.1161/cir.0000000000000264}}</ref> It is designed for use by laypersons, including family members and caregivers of opioid users at-risk for an opioid emergency, such as an overdose.<ref name="FDA News Release">{{cite web|last1=FDA News Release|title=FDA approves new hand-held auto-injector to reverse opioid overdose|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm391465.htm|website=FDA.gov|accessdate=2015-07-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716003000/http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm391465.htm|archivedate=2015-07-16|df=}}</ref> A nasal spray was developed in a partnership between LightLake Therapeutics and the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/noras-blog/2015/11/narcan-nasal-spray-life-saving-science-nida|title=NARCAN Nasal Spray: Life Saving Science at NIDA|last=Volkow|first=Nora|date=18 November 2015|website=DrugAbuse.gov—"Nora's Blog"|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170226133910/https://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/noras-blog/2015/11/narcan-nasal-spray-life-saving-science-nida|archive-date=2017-02-26|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}</ref> The approval process was fast-tracked as one initiative to reduce the death toll caused by opiate overdoses.

Naloxone can be used along with [[oxycodone]] controlled release and may help reduce constipation associated with opioids. By mouth administration of naloxone blocks opioid action at the intestinal receptor level, but has low systemic bioavailability due to hepatic first pass metabolism.<ref name="pmid10601678">{{cite journal |vauthors=Meissner W, Schmidt U, Hartmann M, Kath R, Reinhart K | title = Oral naloxone reverses opioid-associated constipation | journal = Pain | volume = 84 | issue = 1 | pages = 105–9 |date=January 2000  | pmid = 10601678 | doi = 10.1016/S0304-3959(99)00185-2 }}</ref>

==History==
Naloxone was patented in 1961 by [[Jack Fishman]], Mozes J. Lewenstein, and the company [[Daiichi Sankyo|Sankyo]].<ref name="nyti_Jack"/>

==Society and culture==

=== Names ===
The [[patent]] for naloxone has expired. It is available in [[generic drug|generic medication]]. Trade names include: Narcan, Nalone, Evzio, Prenoxad Injection, Narcanti, Narcotan, and others.

===Legal status===
In the [[United States]], naloxone is classified as a prescription medication, though it is not a [[controlled substance]].<ref>21 U.S.C.A. §§801-904; see e.g., LA Rev Stat. Ann. §40:964 (specifically excluding Naloxone from the schedule of controlled substances.)</ref> While it is legal to prescribe naloxone in every state, dispensing the drug by medical professionals (including physicians or other licensed prescribers) at the point of service is subject to rules that vary by jurisdiction. In the following states, you can purchase naloxone from a pharmacist directly without getting a prescription from a doctor: [[Alabama]], [[Alaska]], [[Arizona]], [[Arkansas]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Connecticut]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Idaho]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Iowa]], [[Kentucky]], [[Maine]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Minnesota]], [[Nevada]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Jersey]], [[New Mexico]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[North Carolina]], [[Ohio]], [[Oregon]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Rhode Island]], [[South Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], [[Texas]], [[Utah]], [[Vermont]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[West Virginia]] and [[Wisconsin]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ambrosiatc.com/addiction/narcan/ |title=Everything You Need to Know About Narcan |website=Ambrosia Treatment Center |date=20 July 2016 |accessdate=1 March 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302030645/http://www.ambrosiatc.com/addiction/narcan/ |archivedate=2 March 2017 |df= }}</ref>

While paramedics have carried naloxone for decades, law enforcement officers in many states throughout the country carry naloxone to reverse the effects of heroin overdoses when reaching the location prior to paramedics. As of July 12, 2015, law enforcement departments in 28 states carry naloxone to quickly respond to opioid overdoses.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nchrc.org/law-enforcement/us-law-enforcement-who-carry-naloxone/ |title=US Law Enforcement Who Carry Naloxone |website=North Carolina Harm Reduction Coalition |date= |accessdate=12 July 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713032125/http://www.nchrc.org/law-enforcement/us-law-enforcement-who-carry-naloxone/ |archivedate=13 July 2015 |df= }}</ref>

In Australia, as of February 1, 2016, naloxone is now available "over the counter" in pharmacies without a prescription.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/how-painkiller-use-becomes-a-heroin-addiction/7129964 |title=Why the 'heroin antidote' naloxone is now available in pharmacies |publisher=ABC |date=1 February 2016 |accessdate=1 February 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204040604/http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/how-painkiller-use-becomes-a-heroin-addiction/7129964 |archivedate=4 February 2016 |df= }}</ref> It comes in single use filled syringe similar to law enforcement kits.

In Canada, naloxone single-use syringe kits are distributed and available at various clinics and emergency rooms. Alberta Health Services is increasing the distribution points for naloxone kits at all emergency rooms, and various pharmacies and clinics province-wide.  Also in [[Alberta]], take-home naloxone kits are available and commonly distributed in most drug treatment or rehabilitation centres, as well as in pharmacies where pharmacists can distribute single-use take-home naloxone kits or prescribe the drug to addicts. All [[Edmonton Police Service]] and [[Calgary Police Service]] patrol cars carry an emergency single-use naloxone syringe kit. Some [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] patrol vehicles also carry the drug, occasionally in excess to help distribute naloxone among users and concerned family/friends. Nurses, paramedics, medical technicians, and emergency medical responders can also prescribe and distribute the drug.

Following Alberta Health Services, [[Health Canada]] reviewed the prescription-only status of naloxone, resulting in plans to remove it in 2016, allowing naloxone to be more accessible.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/health/naloxone-s-prescription-only-status-to-get-health-canada-review-1.3166867 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205205030/http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/health/naloxone-s-prescription-only-status-to-get-health-canada-review-1.3166867 |archivedate=2016-02-05 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.health.alberta.ca/health-info/AMH-Naloxone-Take-home.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205142858/http://www.health.alberta.ca/health-info/AMH-Naloxone-Take-home.html |archivedate=2016-02-05 |df= }}</ref> Due to the rising number of drug deaths across the country, Health Canada proposed a change to make naloxone more widely available to Canadians in support of efforts to address the growing number of opioid overdoses.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=1027679 |title=Health Canada Statement on Change in Federal Prescription Status of Naloxone |website=news.gc.ca |date=January 14, 2016 |accessdate=February 29, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110031441/http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=1027679 |archive-date=January 10, 2017 |via=[[Wayback Machine]] |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> In March 2016, Health Canada did change the prescription status of naloxone, as "pharmacies are now able to proactively give out naloxone to those who might experience or witness an opioid overdose."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/prodpharma/pdl-ord/pdl-ldo-qa-naloxone-qr-eng.php |title=Questions and Answers - Naloxone |website=[[Health Canada]] |date=March 22, 2017 |accessdate=June 12, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908140357/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/prodpharma/pdl-ord/pdl-ldo-qa-naloxone-qr-eng.php |archivedate=September 8, 2017 |df= }}</ref>

Following the use of the nasal spray device by police officers on Staten Island in New York, an additional 20,000 police officers will begin carrying naloxone in mid-2014. The state's Office of the Attorney General will provide US$1.2 million to supply nearly 20,000 kits.

A survey of US naloxone prescription programs in 2010 revealed that 21 out of 48 programs reported challenges in obtaining naloxone in the months leading up to the survey, due mainly to either cost increases that outstripped allocated funding or the suppliers' inability to fill orders.<ref name="cdc.gov"/> The approximate cost of a 1&nbsp;ml ampoule of naloxone in the US is estimated to be significantly higher than in most Western countries.<ref name="Beletsky_2009"/>
