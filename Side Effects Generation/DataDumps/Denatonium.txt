Dilutions of as little as 10 [[Parts-per notation#Types of Parts-per notations|ppm]] are unbearably bitter to most humans. Denatonium salts are usually colorless and odorless solids but are often traded as solutions. They are used as [[aversive agent]]s ([[bitterant]]s) to prevent inappropriate [[eating|ingestion]].

== Structure and physical properties ==

Denatonium is a [[quaternary ammonium cation]]. It is a compound of a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] with an [[Chemically inert|inert]] [[ion|anion]] like [[benzoate]] or [[saccharide]]. The structure of denatonium is related to the [[local anesthetic]] [[lidocaine]], differing only by the addition of a [[benzyl]] [[Functional group|group]] to the [[amino group|amino]] [[nitrogen]]. Other similar compounds are [[procaine]] and [[benzocaine]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Holvoet|first1=Jean-Patrick|title=Denatonium|url=http://www.sentinalco.com/page/denatonium/f1.html|publisher=Sentinalco|accessdate=2 October 2015}}</ref>

One of the chemical names for the compound is ''[[Lidocaine]]'' benzylbenzoate, although denatonium only denotes the [[quaternary ammonium cation]] species itself, and does not necessitate the benzoate [[counterion]].

== Biochemistry ==

Denatonium in humans is recognized by eight distinct [[Taste receptor#Bitter|bitter taste receptors]]: [[TAS2R4]], [[TAS2R8]], [[TAS2R10]], [[TAS2R39]], [[TAS2R43]], [[TAS2R16]], [[TAS2R46]], [[TAS2R47]], with TAS2R47 being by far the most sensitive to the compound.<ref name="Meyerhof2010">{{Cite journal | last1 = Meyerhof | first1 = W. | last2 = Batram | first2 = C. | last3 = Kuhn | first3 = C. | last4 = Brockhoff | first4 = A. | last5 = Chudoba | first5 = E. | last6 = Bufe | first6 = B. | last7 = Appendino | first7 = G. | last8 = Behrens | first8 = M. | doi = 10.1093/chemse/bjp092 | title = The Molecular Receptive Ranges of Human TAS2R Bitter Taste Receptors | journal = Chemical Senses | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 157–170 | year = 2009 | pmid =  20022913| pmc = }}</ref><ref name=bitterdb>{{cite web|title=BitterDB - Denatonium benzoate|url=http://bitterdb.agri.huji.ac.il/bitterdb/compound.php?id=94|publisher=Hebrew University of Jerusalem|accessdate=11 June 2013}}</ref>

Denatonium can act as a [[bronchodilator]] by activating bitter taste receptors in the airway smooth muscle.<ref name="Desphande2010">{{Cite journal | last1 = Deshpande | first1 = D.

== Applications ==
The bitterness of the compound guides most applications of denatonium. Denatonium benzoate is used to [[denatured alcohol|denature ethanol]] so that it is not treated as an [[alcoholic beverage]] with respect to taxation and sales restrictions. One designation in particular, [[SD alcohol 40-B|SD-40B]], indicates that ethanol has been denatured using denatonium benzoate. The common name for this chemical, ''denat''onium, alludes to this application.

Denatonium is commonly included in placebo medications used in clinical trials to match the bitter taste of certain medications.

Denatonium also discourages consumption of harmful [[alcohol]]s like [[methanol]], and additives like [[ethylene glycol]]. Denatonium is used in [[rubbing alcohol]] as an inactive ingredient. It is also added to many kinds of harmful liquids including [[solvent]]s (such as [[nail polish remover]]), [[paint]]s, [[varnish]]es, toiletries and other [[personal care]] items, special nail polish for preventing nail biting, and various other household products.  It is also added to less hazardous aerosol products (such as [[gas duster]]s) to discourage [[inhalant abuse]] of the volatile vapors.

In 1995, the U.S. state of [[Oregon]] required that denatonium benzoate be added to products containing sweet-tasting [[ethylene glycol]] and [[methanol]] such as [[antifreeze]] and [[windshield washer fluid]] to prevent poisonings of children and animals.<ref name="Mullins">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mullins ME, Zane Horowitz B |title=Was it necessary to add Bitrex (denatonium benzoate) to automotive products? |journal=Veterinary and human toxicology |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=150–2 |date=June 2004 |pmid=15171494 |doi= |issn=0145-6296 }}</ref> In December 2012, U.S. manufacturers voluntarily agreed to add denatonium benzoate to antifreeze sold nationwide.<ref>{{cite web|title=Antifreeze and Engine Coolant Being Bittered Nationwide|url=http://www.cspa.org/category/news-releases/2012/12/antifreeze-and-engine-coolant-being-bittered-nationwide/|publisher=Consumer Specialty Products Association|accessdate=30 June 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228225407/http://www.cspa.org/news-media-center/news-releases/2012/12/antifreeze-and-engine-coolant-being-bittered-nationwide|archivedate=28 December 2012|date=13 December 2012}}</ref>

Animals are known to have different sensitivities to the effects of denatonium. It is used in some animal repellents (especially for such large [[mammal]]s as [[deer]]).  It has been used to safeguard [[rat poison]]s from human consumption,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pestcontrolshop.co.uk/acatalog/rats.html |title=Rats - Rat Poison & Rat Bait Stations |publisher=Pestcontrolshop.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106210619/http://www.pestcontrolshop.co.uk/acatalog/rats.html |archivedate=2011-01-06 |df= }}</ref> as humans are able to detect denatonium at much lower concentrations than rodents.<ref>Frank ME, Bouverat BP, MacKinnon BI, Hettinger TP.

The video game company [[Nintendo]] uses denatonium benzoate on their physical [[Nintendo game card|Game Cards]] for their hybrid gaming console, the [[Nintendo Switch]]. The aversive agent is coated on the game cartridges to deter children from ingesting them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14778316/nintendo-switch-cartridge-taste-test-dont-lick-it|title=Yes, Nintendo Switch cartridges taste terrible|author=Kwame Opam|date=1 March 2017|work=theverge.com}}</ref>
