'''Eli Lilly and Company''' is an American global [[pharmaceutical]] company with headquarters located in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], in the [[United States]].  The company also has offices in [[Puerto Rico]] and 17 other countries. Its products are sold in approximately 125 countries. The company was founded in 1876 by Col. [[Eli Lilly]], a pharmaceutical [[chemist]] and veteran of the [[American Civil War]], after whom the company was named. Eli Lilly and Company is listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and its shares have been a component of the [[S&P 500 Index]] since 1971.

Lilly was the first company to mass-produce [[penicillin]], the [[Jonas Salk|Salk]] [[polio vaccine]], and [[insulin]]. Its achievements include being one of the first [[pharmaceutical]] companies to produce human [[insulin]] using [[recombinant DNA]] including [[Insulin (medication)|Humulin]], [[Insulin lispro|Humalog]], and the first approved biosimilar insulin product in the US, [[Insulin glargine|Basaglar]].

===Company founder===
{{main|Eli Lilly}}
The company's founder was Colonel [[Eli Lilly]], a [[pharmacist|pharmaceutical chemist]] and [[Union Army|Union army]] veteran of the [[American Civil War]].<ref name=IHSHBR1>{{cite web | title =Eli Lilly & Company |publisher=[[Indiana Historical Society]] | location=Indianapolis | page=1| url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | format =pdf| accessdate =2013-02-26}}</ref> Lilly served as the company president until his death in 1898.<ref name=IHSHBR3>{{cite web| publisher =Indiana Historical Society | title =Eli Lilly & Company | page=3 | url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | format =pdf| accessdate =2013-02-26}}</ref> A stylized version of his signature still appears in the company's logo.<ref name=IHSHBR1/>

In 1869, after working for drugstores in Greencastle and Indianapolis, Indiana, Lilly became a partner in a [[Paris, Illinois]], drugstore with James W. Binford.<ref name=b911>{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Indianapolis|author=David J. Bodenhamer and Robert G. Barrows, eds. |publisher=Indiana University Press | location =Bloomington and Indianapolis | year=1994 |page=911| isbn=0-253-31222-1}}</ref> Although the drugstore was profitable, Lilly was more interested in medicinal manufacturing than running a pharmacy. He began formulating plans to create a company of his own. Lilly left the partnership with Binford in 1873 and returned to Indianapolis. Lilly opened a drug manufacturing operation called Johnston and Lilly with John F. Johnston as his partner in 1874, but dissolved the failing partnership on March 27, 1876. Lilly used his share of the assets, which amounted to an estimated $400 in merchandise (several pieces of equipment and a few gallons of unmixed chemicals) and about $1,000 in cash, to open his own pharmaceutical manufacturing business in Indianapolis in May 1876.<ref name=LillyBio>{{cite web| title =Colonel Eli Lilly (1838â€“1898) | work = | publisher =Lilly Archives  | date =January 2008 | url =http://www.in.gov/governorhistory/mitchdaniels/files/Press/lillybio.pdf | format =pdf | accessdate =October 24, 2016}}</ref><ref name =m6>{{cite book | author=James H.

===Early days: 1870s&ndash;1900===
On May 10, 1876, Lilly opened his own laboratory in a rented, two-story brick building (now demolished) at 15 West Pearl Street in Indianapolis, where he began to manufacture medicinal drugs. The sign outside, above the shop's door, read: "Eli Lilly, Chemist."<ref name=IHSHBR1/><ref name=b540 /><ref>The [[Indiana Historical Society]] recreated a replica of the first Lilly laboratory on Pearl Street for its exhibition, "You Are There: ''Eli Lilly at the Beginning''," at the Eugene and Marilyn Glick Indiana History Center in Indianapolis.

The company outgrew its first location on Pearl Street, where it remained from 1876 to 1878, and moved to larger quarters at 36 South Meridian Street. In 1881 Lilly purchased a complex of buildings on property at McCarty and Alabama Streets and moved the company to its new headquarters in Indianapolis's south-side industrial area. Lilly later purchased additional facilities for research and production.<ref name=IHSHBR14>{{cite web | title =Eli Lilly & Company  |page=1 and 4 | url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | format =pdf | accessdate =2013-02-26}}</ref><ref name=m27>Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 27.</ref>

Lilly committed himself to producing high-quality prescription drugs, in contrast to the common and often ineffective [[patent medicine]]s. From its facilities in Indianapolis the company manufactured and sold "ethical drugs" for use by the medical profession. Lilly's medicines included labels that disclosed product ingredients.<ref name=IHSHBR1/> Lilly's first innovation was gelatin-coating for pills and capsules. The companyâ€™s other early innovations included fruit flavorings and sugarcoated pills, which made the medicines easier to swallow.<ref name=p59/>

In 1881 Lilly formally incorporated the business as Eli Lilly and Company, elected a board of directors, and issued stock to family members and close associates.<ref name=Kahn23/> Colonel Lilly's only son, Josiah (J. K.), a pharmaceutical chemist, graduated from the [[Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science|Philadelphia College of Pharmacy]] in 1882, and joined the family business as a superintendent of its laboratory after college. J. K. became company president in 1898.<ref name=b913>Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 913.</ref> In 1883 the company contracted to mix and sell Succus Alteran, its first widely successful product and one its best sellers. The product was marketed as a "blood purifier" and as a treatment for [[syphilis]], some types of rheumatism, and skin diseases such as [[eczema]] and [[psoriasis]].<ref name=m27/><ref name=MadisonM72>{{cite journal | author =James H.

As the Lilly company grew, other businesses set up operations near the plant on Indianapolis's near south side. The area developed into one of the city's major business and industrial hubs. Lilly's production, manufacturing, research, and administrative operations in Indianapolis eventually occupied a complex of more than two dozen buildings covering a fifteen-block area, as well as production plants along Kentucky Avenue.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Robert M.

Around 1890 Colonel Lilly turned over the day-to-day management of the business to his son, J. K., who ran the company for thirty-four years. Although the 1890s were a tumultuous decade economically, the company flourished and came out stronger than ever.<ref name = b911/><ref name = p60>Price, ''Indiana Legends'', p. 60.</ref> In 1894 Lilly purchased a manufacturing plant to be used solely for creating capsules. The company also made several technological advances in the manufacturing process, including automating its capsule production. Over the next few years the company annually created tens of millions of capsules and pills.<ref name=PodczekJones>{{cite book|title=Pharmaceutical Capsules|author1=Fridrun Podczeck  |author2=Brian E.

Until the turn of the century Lilly operated in Indianapolis and the surrounding area as many other pharmaceutical businesses did&mdash;manufacturing and selling "sugar-coated pills, fluid extracts, elixirs, and syrups."<ref name=MadisonM72/> The company used plants for its raw materials and produced its products by hand. One historian noted, "Although the Indianapolis firm was more careful in making and promoting drugs than the patent medicine men of the era, the company remained ambivalent about scientific research."<ref name=MadisonM72/>

In addition to Colonel Lilly, his brother, James, and son, Josiah (J. K.), the growing company employed other Lilly family. Colonel Lilly's cousin, Evan Lilly, was hired as a bookkeeper.<ref name=p60/> As young boys, Lilly's grandsons, [[Eli Lilly (industrialist)|Eli]] and [[Josiah K. Lilly, Jr.|Josiah Jr.]] (Joe), ran errands and performed other odd jobs. Eli and Joe joined the family business after college. Eventually, each grandson served as company president and chairman of the board.<ref name="IHSHBR256">{{cite web | title =Eli Lilly & Company | pages=2, 5 and 6 | url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | format =pdf| accessdate =2013-02-26}}</ref>

Josiah (J. K.), Colonel Lilly's son and Eli and Joe's father, inherited the company after Colonel Lilly died and became its president in 1898.<ref name=IHSHBR3/> At the time of Colonel Lilly's death the company had a product line of 2,005 items and annual sales of more than $300,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|300000|1898|2015}}}} in 2015 chained dollars).<ref name=bb912>Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 912.</ref> Colonel Lilly was a pioneer in the modern pharmaceutical industry, with many of his early innovations later becoming standard practice.

===Modernization:1900&ndash;40===
Just before and after World War I, the Lilly company experienced rapid change.<ref name=MadisonM72/> Expansion of Lilly's manufacturing facilities at the McCarty Street plant improved production capacity with a new Science Building (Building 14), opened in 1911, and a new capsule plant (Building 15) in 1913.<ref>Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 30.</ref> The company also began constructions of the [[Lilly Biological Laboratories]], a research and manufacturing plant on 150 acres near Greenfield, Indiana, in 1913.<ref>{{cite book | author=Taylor|title =Indiana: A New Historical Guide | page =481|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref name="SHAARD">{{cite web| url = https://secure.in.gov/apps/dnr/shaard/welcome.html| title = Indiana State Historic Architectural and Archaeological Research Database (SHAARD) | publisher = Department of Natural Resources, Division of Historic Preservation and Archaeology | format = Searchable database| accessdate = 2016-04-01}} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web| url =https://secure.in.gov/apps/dnr/shaard/r/1b3be/N/Lilly_Biological_Labs_Hancock_CO_Nom.pdf| title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Lilly Biological Laboratories| accessdate = 2016-04-01| author=Eugene F. Rodman| format = PDF| date=April 1976}} and Accompanying photographs.</ref>

In addition to development of new medicines, the company achieved several technological advances, including automation of its production facilities. Lilly was also an innovator in pill capsule manufacturing. It was among the first manufacturers to insert medications into empty gelatin capsules, which provided a more exact dosage.<ref name=IHSHBR1/> Lilly manufactured capsules for its own needs and sold its excess capacity to others.<ref name=MadisonM73>Madison, "Manufacturing Pharmaceuticals," ''Business and Economic History'', p. 73.</ref> A 1917 ''Scientific American'' article claimed the Lilly operation in Indianapolis was "the largest capsule factory in the world" and was "capable of producing 2.5 million capsules a day".<ref name=MadisonM73/> One of Lilly's innovations was fruit flavoring for medicines and sugar-coated pills to make their medicines easier to swallow.<ref name = p59>Price, ''Indiana Legends'', p. 59.</ref> Over the next few years the company began to create tens of millions of capsules and pills annually.<ref name=PodczekJones/>

Other advances improved plant efficiency and eliminated production errors. Eli Lilly, grandson of the company founder, introduced a method for blueprinting manufacturing tickets in 1909.<ref>Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 29.</ref> This process, which created multiples copies of a drug formula, helped eliminate manufacturing and transcription errors.<ref name=MadisonM73/> In the 1920s Eli introduced the new concept of straight-line production, where raw materials entered at one end of the facility and the finished product came out the other end, in the companyâ€™s manufacturing process. Under Eliâ€™s supervision, the design for Building 22, a new 5-floor plant that opened in Indianapolis in 1926, implemented the straight-line concept to improve production efficiency and lower production costs.<ref>Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 46.</ref><ref name=MadisonM74>Madison, "Manufacturing Pharmaceuticals," ''Business and Economic History'', p. 74.</ref> One historian noted, "It was probably the most sophisticated production system in the American pharmaceutical industry."<ref name=MadisonM74/> This more efficient manufacturing process also allowed the company to hire a regular workforce. Instead of recalling workers at peak times and laying them off when production demand fell, Lilly's regular workforce produced less-costly medicines in off-peak times using the same manufacturing facilities.<ref name="IHSHBR256"/>

During the 1920s the introduction of new products also brought the company financial success.<ref name=MadisonM72/> In 1919 Josiah hired biochemist George Henry Alexander Clowes as director of biochemical research. In 1921 three University of Toronto scientists, [[J. J. R. Macleod]], [[Frederick G. Banting]], and [[Charles H. Best]], were working on the development of [[insulin]] for treatment of diabetes.<ref name=MadisonM76/> Clowes and Eli Lilly met with the researchers in 1922 to negotiate an agreement with the [[University of Toronto]] scientists to mass-produce insulin.<ref>Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 55&ndash;57.</ref> The collaboration led to the first successful large-scale production of insulin.<ref name="Roberts">{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=Jacob|title=Sickening sweet|journal=Distillations|date=2015|volume=1|issue=4|pages=12â€“15|url=https://www.chemheritage.org/distillations/magazine/sickening-sweet|accessdate=3 January 2017}}</ref> In 1923 Lilly began selling Iletin (Insulin, Lilly), their tradename for the first commercially available insulin product in the U.S for the treatment of diabetes.<ref name=MLilly61>Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 61.</ref> Banting and Macleod won a Nobel Prize in 1923 for their research. Insulin, "the most important drug" in the companyâ€™s history, did "more than any other" to make Lilly "one of the major pharmaceutical manufacturers in the world."<ref name=MadisonM76/>

The success of insulin enabled the company to attract well-respected scientists and, with them, make more medical advances. By its fiftieth anniversary in 1926 sales reached $9 million and the company produced more than 2,800 different items.<ref name="IHSHBR256"/> In 1928 Lilly introduced Liver Extract 343 for the treatment of pernicious anemia, a blood disorder, in a joint venture with two [[Harvard University]] scientists, [[George R. Minot]] and [[William P. Murphy]]. In 1930 Lilly introduced Liver Extract No. 55 in collaboration with [[George Whipple]], a [[University of Rochester]] scientist.<ref>Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 66&ndash;67.</ref> Minot, Murphy, and Whipple won the 1934 Nobel Prize in medicine for their research.<ref name=MLilly67>Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 67.</ref>

Despite the economic challenges of the Great Depression, Lilly's sales rose to $13 million in 1932.<ref name=IHSHBR5/> That same year [[Eli Lilly (industrialist)|Eli Lilly]], the eldest grandson of Col. Lilly, was named as the company's president to succeed his father, who remained as chairman of the board until 1948. Eli joined the family business in 1909.<ref name=IHSHBR3/> In his early years at the company Eli was especially interested in improving production efficiency and introduced a number of labor-saving devices. He also introduced scientific management principles and implemented cost-savings measures that modernized the company.<ref>Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 28&ndash;34.</ref> In addition Eli was involved in expanding the companyâ€™s research efforts and collaborations with university researchers.<ref>Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 62&ndash;65.</ref>

In 1934, the firm opened two new facilities on the McCarty Street complex: a replica of Lillyâ€™s 1876 laboratory and the new [[Lilly Research Laboratories]], "one of the most fully equipped facilities in the world."<ref>Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 91.</ref> In the 1930s the company also continued expansion overseas.<ref name=MLilly111>Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 111.</ref> In 1934, Eli Lilly and Company Limited, the company's first overseas subsidiary was established in [[England]], with headquarters in [[London]] and a manufacturing plant in [[Basingstoke, England|Basingstoke]].<ref name=IHSHBR5/><ref name=MLilly111/>

===Expansion: 1940&ndash;70===
[[World War II]] brought production at Lilly to a new high with the manufacturing of [[Thiomersal|Merthiolate]] and penicillin. During the war Lilly also cooperated with the [[American Red Cross]] to process blood plasma and by war's end the company had dried over two million pints of blood, "about 20 percent of the United States' total".<ref name="Madison, Eli Lilly, p. 105">Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 105.</ref> Merthiolate, first introduced in 1930, was an "anticeptic and germicide" that became a U.S. army "standard issue" during World War II.<ref>Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 65 and 106.</ref><ref name=MLilly65>{{cite book | last = Madison | first = James H. | title =Eli Lilly: A Life, 1885&ndash;1977 | page=65| publisher =Indiana Historical Society | year =1989 | location =Indianapolis | isbn =0-87195-047-2}}</ref> In the early 1940s Lilly became one of the companies mass-producing [[penicillin]].<ref>Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 107&ndash;8.</ref>

International operations expanded even further during World War II.<ref name=MLilly111/> Eli Lilly International Corp. was formed in 1943 as a subsidiary to encourage business trade abroad. By 1948 Lilly employees worked in thirty-five countries, most of them as sales representatives in Latin America, Asia, and Africa.<ref name=MLilly111/>

At the end of World War II the company continued to grow. In 1945 Lilly began a major expansion effort that would include two manufacturing operations in Indianapolis. The company purchased the massive Curtiss-Wright propeller plant on South Kentucky Avenue, west of the company's McCarty Street operation. When renovation was completed in mid-1947, the Kentucky Avenue location manufactured antibiotics and capsules and housed the companyâ€™s shipping department.<ref>Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 110.</ref> By 1948 Lilly employed nearly 7,000 people.<ref name=b540>Bodenhamer and Barrows, p. 540.</ref>

Eli Lilly, who had served as the company's president since 1932, retired from active management of the company in 1948, became chairman of the board, and relinquished the presidency to his brother, [[Josiah K. Lilly, Jr.]] (Joe).<ref>Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 91, 119&ndash;20.</ref> During Eli's sixteen-year presidency sales rose from $13 million in 1932 to $117 million in 1948.

Over the next several decades Lilly continued to develop and introduce new drugs to the marketplace. In the 1950s Lilly introduced two new antibiotics: vancomycin and erythromycin. In addition Lilly was heavily involved in production and distribution of [[Jonas Salk]]'s [[Polio vaccine|poliomyelitis (polio) vaccine]]. In 1954 the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (NFIP) contracted with five pharmaceutical companies to produce Salk's polio vaccine for clinical trials. These included Lilly as well as Parke, Davis and Company, Cutter Laboratories, Wyeth Laboratories, and Pitman-Moore Company.<ref name=IHSpolio5>{{cite web | title =Polio and Eli Lilly and Company | work =  | publisher =Indiana Historical Society  |location=Indianapolis | page=5| url =http://www.indianahistory.org/teachers-students/plan-a-field-trip/Polio%20and%20Lilly%20background%20essay.pdf| format =pdf  | accessdate =2013-02-20}}</ref> Lilly's selection to produce the vaccine was, in part, due to its previous experience in collaborations with university researchers.<ref name=IHSpolio6>{{cite web | title =Polio and Eli Lilly and Company | work =  | publisher =Indiana Historical Society  |location=Indianapolis | page=6| url =http://www.indianahistory.org/teachers-students/plan-a-field-trip/Polio%20and%20Lilly%20background%20essay.pdf| format =pdf  | accessdate =2013-02-20}}</ref> Lilly manufactured 60 percent of the Salk vaccine in 1955.

During the mid-twentieth century Lilly continued to expand its production facilities outside of Indianapolis. In 1950 Lilly began Tippecanoe Laboratories in [[Lafayette, Indiana]],<ref name=b541>Bodenhamer and Barrows, p. 541.</ref> and increased [[antibiotic]] production with its patent on [[erythromycin]]. In 1954 Lilly formed Elanco Products Company for the production of [[veterinary]] pharmaceuticals. In 1969, the company opened a new plant in [[Clinton, Indiana]].<ref name=b541/>

After a company reorganization and transition to non-family management in 1953, Lilly continued to expand its global presence. In the 1960s Lilly operated thirteen affiliate companies outside the United States.<ref name=IHSHBR6/> In 1962, with an acquisition from Distillers Company, the company established a major factory in [[Liverpool]], England. In 1968, Lilly built its first research facility, the Lilly Research Centre Limited, outside the United States near [[London|London, England]].

===1970&ndash; present===
During the 1970s and 1980s, Eli Lilly and Company saw a flurry of drug production: an antibiotic, [[Cefalexin|Keflex]], in 1971; a heart drug, [[Dobutamine|Dobutrex]], in 1977; Ceclor, which would become the world's top selling oral antibiotic, in 1979; a [[leukemia]] drug, Eldisine; an antiarthritic, [[Benoxaprofen|Oraflex]]; and an analgesic, [[Dextropropoxyphene|Darvon]]. When generic drugs flooded the marketplace after the expiration of patents for drugs discovered in the 1950s and 1960s, Lilly diversified into other areas, most notably agricultural chemicals, animal-health products, cosmetics, and medical instruments.

To further diversify its product line, Lilly made an uncharacteristic, but ultimately profitable move in 1971, when it bought cosmetic manufacturer [[Elizabeth Arden, Inc.]] for $38 million. Although the subsidiary continued to lose money for five years after Lilly acquired it, executive management changes at Arden helped turn it into a financial success. By 1982 the subsidiary's "sales were up 90 percent from 1978, with profits doubling to nearly $30 million." Sixteen years after its acquisition, Lilly sold Arden to [[FabergÃ© (cosmetics)|FabergÃ©]] in 1987 for $657 million.<ref name=IHSHBR7>{{cite web | title =Eli Lilly & Company | page=7 | url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | format =pdf| accessdate =2013-02-26}}</ref>

In 1977, Lilly ventured into medical instruments with the acquisition of IVAC Corporation, which manufactures vital signs and [[intravenous]] fluid infusion monitoring systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/14/archives/eli-lilly-signs-agreement-to-acquire-ivac-corp.html?nytmobile=0|title=Eli Lilly Signs Agreement To Acquire Ivac Corp.|last=Times|first=Special to the New York|access-date=2017-08-17}}</ref> Lilly also purchased Cardiac Pacemakers Incorporated, a manufacturer of [[Artificial pacemaker|heart pacemakers]] in 1977. In 1980, Lilly acquired Physio-Control Corporation. Other acquisitions included Advance Cardiovasular Systems Incorporated in 1984, Hybritech in 1986, and Devices for Vascular Intervention, Incorporated in 1989. Lilly acquired Pacific Biotech in 1990 and Origin Medsystems and Heart Rhythm Technologies, Incorporated in 1992. In the early 1990s, Lilly combined these medical equipment companies into a Medical Devices and Diagnostics Division that "contributed about 20 percent" of Lillyâ€™s annual revenues.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In 1989, a joint agri-chemical venture between Elanco Products Company and [[Dow Chemical]] created DowElanco. In 1997, Lilly sold its 40 percent share in the company to Dow Chemical for $1.2 billion and the name was changed to [[Dow AgroSciences]].<ref name=IHSHBR68>{{cite web | title =Eli Lilly & Company | page=6 and 8 | url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | format =pdf| accessdate =2013-02-26}}</ref><ref name=DowElanco>{{cite web | title =Dow AgroSciences Fast Facts | work = | publisher =Dow AgroSciences | url =http://www.dowagro.com/newsroom/fast_facts/index.htm | accessdate =2013-02-20 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://archive.is/20130410180827/http://www.dowagro.com/newsroom/fast_facts/index.htm | archivedate =10 April 2013 | df =dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[http://www.dowagro.com/newsroom/mediakit/facts.htm dowagro.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081115233259/http://www.dowagro.com/newsroom/mediakit/facts.htm |date=15 November 2008 }}</ref>

In 1994, Lilly acquired PCS Systems, a drug delivery business for Health Maintenance Organizations, and later added two similar organizations to its holdings.<ref name=IHSHBR8>{{cite web | title =Eli Lilly & Company | page=8 | url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | format =pdf| accessdate =2013-02-26}}</ref> Lilly purchased PCS, which was the largest U.S. prescription drug benefits manager at the time, for $4 billion.<ref name=Kokomo73194>{{cite news | last =Armor | first =Nancy | title =New Lilly Chief Nurtures Change | newspaper =Kokomo Tribune | location =Kokomo, IN | page = | language = | publisher = | date =1994-07-31 | url = | accessdate =2013-02-27}}</ref>

In 1991, Vaughn Bryson was named [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Eli Lilly. During his 20-month tenure, the company reported its first quarterly loss as a publicly traded company.<ref name=KokomoTrib62893/> In 1993 [[Randall L.

In 1998, Eli Lilly formed a joint venture with [[Icos|Icos Corporation]] (ICOS), a [[Bothell, Washington]]-based biotechnology company, to develop and commercialize [[Tadalafil|Cialis]], a product for the treatment of [[erectile dysfunction]].

==Collaborative research==
{{further|Lilly Research Laboratories}}
Eli Lilly and Company has a long history of collaboration with research scientists. In 1886 Ernest G. Eberhardt, a chemist, joined the company as its first full-time research scientist.<ref name=IHSHBR12>{{cite web | title =Eli Lilly & Company | page=1 and 2 | url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | format =pdf| accessdate =2013-02-26}}</ref> Lilly also hired two botanists, Walter H. Evans and John S. Wright, to join its early research efforts.<ref name=IHSHBR2/><ref>Eberhardt and Evans were [[Purdue University]] graduates. See {{cite web | title =Eli Lilly & Company | page=2 | url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | format =pdf| accessdate =2013-02-26}}</ref> After World War I the companyâ€™s expanded production facilities and introduction of new management methods set the stage for Lilly's next crucial phase&mdash;its "aggressive entry into scientific research and development."<ref name=b540 /> The first big step came in 1919 when Josiah Lilly hired biochemist George Henry Alexander Clowes as director of biochemical research.<ref>Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 53.</ref> Clowes had extensive medical research expertise and links to the scientific research community, which led to the company's collaborations with researchers in the U.S. and elsewhere.<ref name=MLilly55>Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 55.</ref> Clowes's first major collaboration with researchers who developed [[insulin]] at the [[University of Toronto]] significantly impacted the companyâ€™s future.<ref name=MLilly55/> Lillyâ€™s success with insulin production secured the company's position as a leading research-based pharmaceutical manufacturer, allowing it to attract and hire more research scientists and to collaborate with other universities in additional medical research.<ref>Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 63.</ref> In 1934 the company built a new research laboratory in Indianapolis.<ref name=MadisonM76>Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 76.</ref> As part of its research and product development process Lilly also conducted clinical studies at Indianapolis City Hospital (Wishard Memorial Hospital). Lilly continues to conduct clinical studies to test medications before their introduction to the market.<ref name=IHSHBR4>{{cite web |  title =Eli Lilly & Company | page=4 | url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | format =pdf| accessdate =2013-02-26}}.</ref> In 1949 Eli Lilly actually went into partnership with the United States Army Reserve setting up a local Strategic Intelligence Research and Analysis (SIRA)Unit to allow employees to research company data for the Scientific Logistics and Eurasian fields of study (source: declassified Defense Intelligence Agency document MDR -0191-2008 dated 17 Sep 2012). In 1998 the company dedicated new laboratories for clinical research at the Indiana University Medical Center in Indianapolis.

===Publicly funded research===
In addition to internal research and development activities, Lilly is also involved in publicly funded research projects with other industrial and academic partners. One example in the area of [[Pre-clinical development|non-clinical]] safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox, a collaboration with pharmaceutical companies, research organizations, and the [[European Commission]] to improve the safety of drugs.<ref>{{cite web | title =Alliances | work = | publisher =Genedata | location =Basel, Switzerland | url =http://www.genedata.com/alliances.html | accessdate =2013-02-27 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=Consortium>{{cite web | title = InnoMed PredTox Consortium Members Present Preliminary Study Results | publisher =Genedata | location = Basel, Switzerland | date =2008-05-15 | url =http://www.genedata.com/index.php?id=211&L=0&tx_ttnews%5bpS%5d=1259741735&tx_ttnews%5btt_news%5d=22&cHash=139a0c79812ccfccf9dbf2a79a1001ab}} {{dead link|date=October 2015}}</ref> In 2008 this consortium, which included Lilly S.A.

==Pharmaceutical brands==
The company's most important products introduced prior to World War II included [[insulin]], which Lilly marketed as Iletin (Insulin, Lilly), Amytal, Merthiolate, ephedrine, and liver extracts.<ref name=MLilly65/> Introduced in 1923, Iletin (Insulin, Lilly) was Lilly's first commercial insulin product. In 2002 the company was the leading producer of products for those with diabetes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

During World War II Lilly produced penicillins and other antibiotics. In addition to penicillin, other wartime production included "antimalarials," blood plasma, encephalitis vaccine, typhus and influenza vaccine, gas gangrene antitoxin, Merthiolate, and Iletin (Insulin, Lilly).<ref>Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 105&ndash;6.</ref>

Among the company's more recent pharmaceutical developments are [[cephalosporin]], [[erythromycin]], and [[Prozac]] (fluoxetine), a [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SSRI) for the treatment of [[clinical depression]]. Ceclor, introduced in the 1970s, was an oral cephalosporin antibiotic. Prozac, introduced in the 1980s, quickly became the company's best-selling product for treatment of depression, but Lilly lost its U.S. patent protection for this product in 2001. Among other distinctions, Lilly is the world's largest manufacturer and distributor of medications used in a broad range of [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] and [[mental health]]-related conditions, including [[clinical depression]], [[generalized anxiety disorder]], [[narcotic]] addiction, [[insomnia]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[schizophrenia]], and others.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Cialis===
{{further|Tadalafil}}
In 2003, Eli Lilly introduced [[Tadalafil|Cialis]] (tadalafil), a competitor to [[Pfizer]]'s blockbuster [[Viagra]] for [[erectile dysfunction]]. Cialis maintains an active period of 36 hours, causing it sometimes to be dubbed the "weekend pill". Cialis was developed in a partnership with [[biotechnology]] company Icos Corporation. On December 18, 2006, Lilly bought Icos in order to gain full control of the product.<ref>With its television advertisement for Cialis during the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII|2004 Super Bowl Halftime Show]], Eli Lilly was one of several companies whose costly 2004 [[Super Bowl]] Halftime advertisements were largely overshadowed by the [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Justin Timberlake]] [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}</ref>

===Cymbalta===
{{further|Duloxetine}}
Another Lilly manufactured anti-depressant, [[Duloxetine|Cymbalta]], a [[serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] used predominantly in the treatment of major depressive disorders and generalized anxiety disorder, ranks with Prozac as one of the most financially successful pharmaceuticals in industry history.  It is also used in the treatment of [[fibromyalgia]], [[neuropathy]], [[chronic pain]] and [[osteoarthritis]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Gemzar===
{{further|Gemcitabine}}
In 1996, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] approved [[gemcitabine|Gemzar]] for the treatment of [[pancreatic cancer]]. Gemzar is commonly used in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, usually in coordination with 5-FU [[chemotherapy]] and radiology. Gemzar also is routinely used in the treatment of non-small cell [[lung cancer]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Methadone===
{{further|Methadone}}
Eli Lilly was the first distributor of [[methadone]], an [[analgesic]] used frequently in the treatment of [[heroin]], [[opium]] and other [[opioid]] and [[narcotic]] [[drug addiction]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Prozac===
{{further|Fluoxetine}}
Prozac was one of the first therapies in its class to treat clinical depression by blocking the uptake of [[serotonin]] within the [[human brain]].  It is prescribed to more than fifty-four million people worldwide.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Prozac was approved by the U.S. FDA in 1987 for use in treating depression. In 2001 Lilly lost its U.S. patent protection for Prozac and in January 2002 the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Lilly's final appeal, a decision that allows other companies to make generic versions of the drug. Prozac has given rise to a number of comparably functioning therapies for the treatment of clinical depression and other [[central nervous system]] disorders such as [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], [[bulimia nervosa]], and panic disorders.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

====Prozac in popular culture====
Because of its wide appeal as a popular anti-depressant, references to Prozac have appeared in books, movies, and music. ''[[Prozac Nation (book)|Prozac Nation]]'' (1994), an autobiographical book by [[Elizabeth Wurtzel]], was turned into a [[Prozac Nation (film)|film]] of the same name in 2001 and starred [[Christina Ricci]]. ''[[Listening to Prozac]]'' (1993), by Peter Kramer, was a generally analytical look at Prozac and its uses, not only to treat disorders but to diagnose them as well. ''Talking Back to Prozac'' (1994), by psychiatrist [[Peter Breggin]], focuses on Prozac's side effects. Rapper [[Jay-Z]] referenced Prozac in the song, "[[Nigga What, Nigga Who (Originator 99)|Nigga What, Nigga Who]]" (1998). In [[HBO]]'s fictional series, ''[[The Sopranos]]'', [[Tony Soprano]]'s use of Prozac is periodically referenced.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Secobarbital===
{{further|Secobarbital}}
Eli Lilly has manufactured [[Secobarbital]], a [[barbiturate]] derivative with [[anaesthetic]], [[anticonvulsant]], [[sedative]] and [[hypnosis|hypnotic]] properties. Lilly marketed Secobarbital under the brand name Seconal. Secobarbital is indicated for the treatment of [[epilepsy]], temporary [[insomnia]] and as a pre-operative medication to produce anaesthesia and [[anxiolysis]] in short surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures which are minimally painful. With the onset of new therapies for the treatment of these conditions, Secobarbital has been less utilized, and Lilly ceased manufacturing it in 2001.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

====Secobarbital overdoses====
Secobarbital gained considerable attention during the 1970s, when it gained wide popularity as a [[Recreational drug use|recreational drug]]. On September 18, 1970, [[rock music|rock]] guitarist legend [[Jimi Hendrix]] died from a secobarbital overdose. On June 22, 1969, secobarbital overdose was the cause of death of actress [[Judy Garland]]. The drug was a central part of the plot of the hugely popular novel ''[[Valley of the Dolls]]'' (1966) by [[Jacqueline Susann]] in which three highly successful [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] women each fall victim, in various ways, to the drug. The novel was later released as a film by the same name.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Thimerosal===
{{further|Thiomersal}}
Eli Lilly has developed the [[vaccine]] preservative [[thiomersal]] (also called merthiolate and thimerosal). Thiomersal is effective by causing susceptible bacteria to [[Autolysis (biology)|autolyze]]. Launched in 1930, merthiolate was a mercury-based antiseptic and germicide that "had been formulated at the [[University of Maryland]] with support of a Lilly research fellowship."<ref name=MLilly65/>

===Zyprexa===

[[Olanzapine|Zyprexa]] (for [[schizophrenia]] and [[bipolar disorder]], as well as [[off-label]] uses) Released in 1996, and as of 2010, Lilly's best-selling drug of all time<ref>{{cite news|author=Wilson, Duff|title=Side Effects May Include Lawsuits|date=October 2, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/business/03psych.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|accessdate=September 23, 2011}}</ref>
==Leadership==
After three generations of Lilly family leadership under company founder, Col. Eli Lilly, his son, Josiah K. Lilly Sr., and two grandsons, Eli Lilly Jr. and Josiah K. Lilly Jr., the company announced a reorganization in 1944 that prepared the way for future expansion and the eventual separation of company management from its ownership.<ref name=MLilly112>Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 112.</ref> The large, complex corporation was divided into smaller groups headed by vice presidents and in 1953 Eugene N. Beesley was named the first non-family member to become the companyâ€™s president.<ref name=IHSHBR6>{{cite web | title =Eli Lilly & Company | work = | publisher =Indiana Historical Society | location=Indianapolis |page=6 | url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-services/books-publications/hbr/eli-lilly.pdf | format =pdf| accessdate =2013-02-26}}</ref>

Although Lilly family members continued to serve as chairman of the board until 1969, Beesley's appointment began the transition to non-family management.<ref name=IHSHBR6/> In 1972 Richard D. Wood became Lilly's president and CEO after the retirement of Burton E. Beck.<ref>{{cite news | last =Associated Press | first = | title =Lilly Director Dies in Hawaii | newspaper =Anderson Herald | location =Anderson, IN | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =1977-03-29 | url = | accessdate =2013-02-27}}</ref> In 1991 Vaughn Bryson became president and Wood became board chairman.<ref>{{cite news | last =Associated Press | first = | title =Lilly Move No Big Surprise | newspaper =Kokomo Tribune | location =Kokomi, IN | page = | language = | publisher = | date =1991-09-18 | url = | accessdate =2013-02-27}}</ref> During Bryson's 20-month tenure as Lilly's president and CEO, the company reported its first quarterly loss as a publicly traded company.<ref name=KokomoTrib62893 />

[[Randall L. Tobias]], a vice chairman of [[AT&T Corporation]], was named chairman, president, and CEO in June 1993. Tobias, a Lilly board member since 1986, was recruited from outside the company's executive ranks to replace Lilly's president, Vaughn Bryson, and board chairman, Richard Wood.<ref name=KokomoTrib62893>{{cite news | last =Associated Press | first = | title =New Lilly Chief Doesn't Have Own 'Agenda' | newspaper =[[Kokomo Tribune]] | location =Kokomi, IN | date =1993-06-26 | url =https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/2578015/ | accessdate =2015-10-27|subscription=yes}}</ref> Tobias later became the U.S. director of Foreign Assistance and administrator of the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] (USAID), with the rank of ambassador.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2006-03-29/pdf/CREC-2006-03-29-pt1-PgS2546-3.pdf|title=Congressional Record, March 29, 2006, S2546|publisher=}}</ref>

[[Sidney Taurel]], former chief operating officer of Lilly, was named CEO in July 1998 to replace Tobias, who retired.

===Community service===
The Lilly family as well as Eli Lilly and Company has a long history of community service. Around 1890 Col. Lilly turned over operation of the family business to his son, Josiah, who ran the company for the next several decades.<ref name=IHSHBR2/> Col. Lilly remained active in civic affairs and assisted a number of local organizations, including the Commercial Club of Indianapolis, which later became the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce,<ref name=b399>Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 399.</ref> and the [[Charity Organization Society]], a forerunner to the Family Services Association of Central Indiana, an organization supported by [[United Way of America|United Way]].<ref name=IHSHBR2/><ref>Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., pp. 402&ndash;03, 911&ndash;12, and 560&ndash;61.</ref> Josiahâ€™s sons, Eli and Joe, were also philanthropists who supported numerous cultural and educational organizations.<ref name=b91012>Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., pp. 910&ndash;12.</ref>

It was Josiah Sr. who continued his father's civic mindedness and began the company tradition of sending aid to disaster victims.<ref name=IHSHBR3 /> Following the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], the company sent much needed medicine to support recovery efforts and provided relief after the 1936 [[Johnstown Flood]].<ref name=IHSHBR3/>

===Lilly Endowment===
{{main|Lilly Endowment}}
In 1937, Josiah K. Lilly Sr. and his two sons, Eli and Joe, founded the [[Lilly Endowment]], a private charitable foundation, with gifts of Lilly stock.<ref name=MLilly20506>Madison, ''Eli Lilly'', p. 205&ndash;6.</ref>

===Eli Lilly and Company Foundation===
The Eli Lilly and Company Foundation, which is separate from the Lilly Endowment, operates as a tax-exempt private charitable foundation that the company established in 1968.
