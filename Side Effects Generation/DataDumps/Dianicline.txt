'''Dianicline''' ('''SSR-591,813''') is a drug developed by [[Sanofi-Aventis]] which acts as a [[partial agonist]] at neural [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s. It is subtype-selective, binding primarily to the [[Alpha-4 beta-2 nicotinic receptor|α4β2]] [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor#Subunits|subtype]]. It is being developed as a medication for the treatment of [[nicotine]] dependence to assist in [[smoking cessation]].<ref>Cohen C, Bergis OE, Galli F, Lochead AW, Jegham S, Biton B, Leonardon J, Avenet P, Sgard F, Besnard F, Graham D, Coste A, Oblin A, Curet O, Voltz C, Gardes A, Caille D, Perrault G, George P, Soubrie P, Scatton B. SSR591813, a novel selective and partial alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor agonist with potential as an aid to smoking cessation. ''Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics''. 2003 Jul;306(1):407-20. {{PMID|12682217}}</ref> Dianicline is very similar to the already marketed drug [[varenicline]] and it is unclear what advantages it will have over the older drug, although it may have an improved side effect profile. It has been through human trials up to Phase II, although results have not yet been reported. Drug development has been discontinued after reporting of unfavourable results during Phase III trials.<ref>Fagerström K, Balfour DJK.
