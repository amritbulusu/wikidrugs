==History==
Muromonab-CD3 (OKT3) was approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1985,<ref name="Smith">{{Cite journal

In the [[European Communities]], it was the first drug to be approved under the [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] 87/22/EWG, a precursor of the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMEA) centralised approval system in the [[European Union]]. This process included an assessment by the [[Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products]] (CPMP, now CHMP), and a subsequent approval by the national health agencies; in [[Germany]], for example, in 1988 by the Paul Ehrlich Institute in [[Frankfurt]]. However, the manufacturer of Muromonab-CD3 has voluntarily withdrawn<ref>{{cite journal|last=Abdi|first=Reza|author2=Spencer Martin |author3=Steven Gabardi |title=Immunosuppressive Strategies in Human Renal Transplantation – Induction Therapy|journal=Nephrology Rounds|year=2009|volume=7|issue=4|url=http://www.nephrologyrounds.org/crus/304-072.pdf|accessdate=11 November 2012}}</ref> it from the United States market due to decreased utilization; current OKT3 supplies are expected to be exhausted by mid-2010.

==Indications==
Muromonab-CD3 is approved for the therapy of acute, [[glucocorticoid]]-resistant rejection of [[Allotransplantation|allogeneic]] [[Renal transplant|renal]], [[Heart transplant|heart]] and [[liver transplant]]s.<ref name="DrugsCom">{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/mmx/orthoclone-okt3.html|title=Orthoclone OKT3|work=Professional Drug Information|publisher=Drugs.com|accessdate=3 January 2010}}</ref> Unlike the monoclonal antibodies [[basiliximab]] and [[daclizumab]], it is not approved for [[prophylaxis]] of transplant rejection, although a 1996 review has found it to be safe for that purpose.<ref name="Smith" />

It has also been investigated for use in treating [[T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma|T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia]].<ref name="pmid7885036">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Gramatzki M, Burger R, Strobel G, etal |title=Therapy with OKT3 monoclonal antibody in refractory T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia induces interleukin-2 responsiveness |journal=Leukemia |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=382–90 |date=March 1995 |pmid=7885036}}</ref>

==Pharmacodynamics and chemistry==
T cells recognise [[antigen]]s primarily via the [[T cell receptor]]. This receptor needs various co-receptors to function, one of which is CD3. The T cell receptor-CD3 complex transduces the signal for the T cell to [[Cell proliferation|proliferate]] and attack the antigen.

Muromonab-CD3 is a [[murine]] (mouse) monoclonal [[IgG2]]a antibody which was created using [[hybridoma technology]]. It binds to the T cell receptor-CD3-complex (specifically the CD3 epsilon chain) on the surface of circulating T cells, initially leading to an activation, but subsequently inducing blockage and [[apoptosis]] of the T cells. This protects the transplant against the T cells.<ref name="Mutschler" /><ref name="DrugsCom" />
After application of muromonab-CD3, normal T cell function is said to be restored within a week. When administered for transplant induction, the drug is administered daily thereafter for up to 7 days.<ref>Bhorade, S. M., Stern, E. (2009). Immunosuppression for Lung Transplantation. Proc Am Thorac Soc 6: 47-53</ref>

Newer monoclonal antibodies in development with the same mechanism of action include [[otelixizumab]] (also known as TRX4), [[teplizumab]] (also known as hOKT3γ1(Ala-Ala) ), and [[visilizumab]] (with a tentative trade name of ''Nuvion''). They are being investigated for the treatment of other conditions like [[Crohn's disease]], [[ulcerative colitis]], and [[type 1 diabetes]]. Further development of [[teplizumab]] is uncertain, due to one-year data from a recent Phase III trial being "disappointing".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/macrogenics-and-lilly-ponder-future-of-diabetes-mab-after-phase-iii-flop/81244098/ |title=MacroGenics and Lilly Ponder Future of Diabetes mAb after Phase III Flop |date=21 Oct 2010 }}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Especially during the first infusion, the binding of muromonab-CD3 to CD3 can activate T cells to release [[cytokines]] like [[tumor necrosis factor]] and [[interferon gamma]]. This [[cytokine release syndrome]], or CRS, includes side effects like skin reactions, [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[fever]], [[chills]], [[myalgia]], [[headaches]], [[nausea]] and [[diarrhea]],<ref>{{Cite journal

}}</ref> and could lead to life-threatening conditions like [[apnoea]], [[cardiac arrest]], and [[flash pulmonary edema]].<ref name="DrugsCom" /> To minimize the risk of CRS and to offset some of the minor side effects patient experience, [[glucocorticoid]]s (such as [[methylprednisolone]]), [[acetaminophen]], and [[diphenhydramine]] are given before the infusion.<ref>Bhorade, S. M., Stern, E. (2009). Immunosuppression for Lung Transplantation. Proc Am Thorac Soc 6: 47-53</ref>

Other adverse effects include [[leucopenia]], as well as an increased risk for severe infections and [[malignancies]] typical of immunosuppressive therapies. [[Neurology|Neurological]] side effects like [[aseptic meningitis]] and [[encephalopathy]] have been observed. Possibly, they are also caused by the T cell activation.<ref name="DrugsCom" />

Repeated application can result in [[tachyphylaxis]] (reduced effectiveness) due to the formation of anti-mouse antibodies in the patient, which accelerates elimination of the drug. It can also lead to an [[anaphylactic reaction]] against the mouse protein,<ref name="Mutschler" /> which may be difficult to distinguish from a CRS.

==Contraindications==
Except under special circumstances, the drug is contraindicated for patients with an allergy against mouse proteins, as well as patients with uncompensated [[heart failure]], uncontrolled [[arterial hypertension]] or [[epilepsy]]. It should not be used during [[pregnancy]] or [[lactation]].<ref name="Mutschler" /><ref name="DrugsCom" />

==Etymology==
Muromonab-CD3 was developed before the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] [[nomenclature of monoclonal antibodies]] took effect, and consequently its name does not follow this convention. Instead, it is a contraction from "''mur''ine ''mon''oclonal ''a''nti''b''ody targeting ''CD3''".<ref name="Mutschler" />
