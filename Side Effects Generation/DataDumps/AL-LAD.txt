'''AL-LAD''', also known as '''6-[[allyl]]-6-''nor''-LSD''', is a [[psychedelic drug]] and an [[structural analog|analog]] of [[lysergic acid diethylamide]] (LSD).<ref>{{cite journal | author1=Simon D.

It is synthesized starting from nor-LSD as a precursor, using [[allyl bromide]] as a reactant.

== Effects in humans ==
[[File:AL-LAD blotter.jpg|thumb|right|AL-LAD on blotter paper]]

While AL-LAD has subtly different effects than LSD, and appears to be slightly shorter lasting, their potencies are similar;<ref>{{cite book | url=https://link.springer.com/bookseries/7854 | chapter-url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/7854_2016_15 | DOI=10.1007/7854_2016_15 | pmid=27272067 | ISSN=1866-3370 | title=Current Topics in Behavioral Neurosciences | publisher=Springer International Publishing | author=Fabrizio Schifano | author2=Laura Orsolini | author3=Duccio Papanti | author4=John Corkery | date=June 2016 | pages=1–30 | OCLC=643052237 | chapter=NPS: Medical Consequences Associated with Their Intake}}</ref><ref name="pmid4032428">{{cite journal |author=Hoffman AJ, Nichols DE |title=Synthesis and LSD-like discriminative stimulus properties in a series of N(6)-alkyl norlysergic acid N,N-diethylamide derivatives |journal=Journal of Medicinal Chemistry |volume=28 |issue=9 |pages=1252–5 |date=September 1985 |pmid=4032428 |doi= 10.1021/jm00147a022|url=|last2=Nichols }}</ref> an active dose of AL-LAD is reported to be between 50 and 150 [[microgram]]s.<ref name="tihkal 26">{{cite book | url=https://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal26.shtml | title=TiHKAL: The Continuation | publisher=Transform Press | author=Shulgin, Alexander | authorlink=Alexander Shulgin | year=1997 | location=Berkeley, California | isbn=0-9630096-9-9|page=392}}</ref> AL-LAD has a known but short and highly uncommon history of recreational human use, which originated in Ireland and the UK, but spread internationally.

==Chemistry==
AL-LAD does not cause a color change with the [[Marquis reagent|Marquis]], [[Mecke reagent|Mecke]] or [[Mandelin reagent|Mandelin]] reagents,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ecstasydata.org/view.php?id=2829 | title = EcstasyData.org - AL-LAD (Not sold as ecstasy) | accessdate = 2013-12-25 | author = Ecstasydata}}</ref> but does cause the [[Ehrlich's reagent]] to turn purple because of the presence of the [[indole]] moiety in its structure.

== Legal status ==
AL-LAD is not scheduled by the [[United Nations]]' [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]].<ref name="UNCPS">[https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/commissions/CND/conventions.html Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971]</ref>

=== Denmark ===
AL-LAD is illegal in Denmark.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://laegemiddelstyrelsen.dk/en/licensing/company-authorisations-and-registrations/euphoriant-substances/lists-of-substances | title=Lists of euphoriant substances | publisher=The Danish Medicines Agency | date=September 2015}}</ref>

=== Latvia ===
AL-LAD is possibly illegal in Latvia. Although it isn't specifically scheduled, it may be controlled as an LSD structural analog due to an amendment made on June 1, 2015.<ref name="likumi.lv">[http://likumi.lv/doc.php?id=121086 Noteikumi par Latvijā kontrolējamajām narkotiskajām vielām, psihotropajām vielām un prekursoriem (2.4.punkts)]</ref>

=== Sweden ===
[[Riksdag|The Riksdag]] added AL-LAD to [[:sv:Narkotikastrafflagen|Narcotic Drugs Punishments Act]] under ''swedish schedule I'' (''"substances, plant materials and fungi which normally do not have medical use"'' ) as of January 26, 2016, published by [[Medical Products Agency (Sweden)|Medical Products Agency (MPA)]] in regulation ''HSLF-FS 2015:35'' listed as '''6-allyl-6-nor-LSD, AL-LAD''', and '''6-allyl-N,N-dietyl-9,10-didehydroergolin-8-karboxamid'''.<ref>https://lakemedelsverket.se/upload/lvfs/HSLF-FS/HSLFS-FS_2015_35.pdf</ref>

=== Switzerland ===
AL-LAD is illegal in Switzerland.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/20101220/index.html | title=Verordnung des EDI über die Verzeichnisse der Betäubungsmittel, psychotropen Stoffe, Vorläuferstoffe und Hilfschemikalien | publisher=Der Bundesrat | language=German}}</ref>

=== United Kingdom ===
AL-LAD is illegal in the UK. On June 10, 2014 the UK [[Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs]] (ACMD) recommended that AL-LAD be specifically named in the [[UK Misuse of Drugs Act]] as a class A drug despite not identifying any harm associated with its use.<ref name="ACMD tryptamines">{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/318693/UpdateGenericDefinitionTryptamines.pdf | title=Update of the Generic Definition  for Tryptamines | publisher=UK Home Office | date=10 June 2014 | accessdate=10 June 2014 | author=ACMD|page=12}}</ref> The UK Home office accepted this advice and announced a ban of the substance to be enacted on 6 January 2015 as part of [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/3271/made The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 2014].

===United States===
AL-LAD is not [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedules of controlled substances|scheduled]] as a [[controlled substance]] at the [[Federal government of the United States|federal level]] in the [[United States]],<ref name="PART 1308 — SCHEDULES OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES - 1308.11 Schedule I">[http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1308/1308_11.htm §1308.11 Schedule I.]</ref> but AL-LAD could legally be considered an [[structural analog|analog]] of [[LSD]], in which case, sales or [[Drug possession|possession]] with intent for human consumption could be prosecuted under the [[Federal Analogue Act]].<ref>[https://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/law/analog/analog_info1.shtml Erowid Analog Law Vault : Federal Controlled Substance Analogue Act Summary]</ref>
