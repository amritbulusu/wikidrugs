'''Forodesine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]; also known as '''Immucillin H'''; trade names '''Mundesine''' and '''Fodosine''') is a transition-state analog inhibitor of purine nucleoside phosphorylase<ref name="pmid11287638">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kicska GA, Long L, Hörig H |title=Immucillin H, a powerful transition-state analog inhibitor of purine nucleoside phosphorylase, selectively inhibits human T lymphocytes |journal=Proc.

Forodesine was originally discovered by [[Vern Schramm]]'s laboratory at the [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]] in New York and [[Industrial Research Limited]] in New Zealand. 

Forodesine is being [[drug development|developed]] by [[BioCryst Pharmaceuticals]]. {{As of|2008}}, it is currently in [[clinical trial|phase II clinical trials]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=Forodesine&flds=Xabce |title=Complete list of clinical trials for forodesine (BCX-1777) (ClinicalTrials.gov) |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-07-22}}</ref>{{update inline|date=March 2015}}.

In 2006, BioCryst entered into a licensing agreement with Mundipharma International Holdings Limited to develop and commercialize forodesine in markets across Europe, Asia, and Australasia for use in oncology.<ref>{{Cite press release | url = http://investor.shareholder.com/biocryst/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=225663 | title = Biocryst Initiates Pivotal Fodosine Phase IIb Clinical Trial In Patients With Relapsed/Refractory T-Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma | date = January 16, 2007}}</ref>

In April 2017, forodesine was approved in Japan for the treatment of relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma.<ref>{{Cite press release | url = http://investor.shareholder.com/biocryst/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=1019740| title = BioCryst Announces Mundipharma Receives Approval for Mundesine<sup>®</sup> in Japan| date = April 3, 2017}}</ref>

What benefit has Atriance  shown during the studies? Atriance was shown to be effective in a proportion of the patients in both studies. In the first study,  among the 39 children and young adults who se cancer  had  not responded to  two or more previous  treatments, five (13%) had a complete response to treatment after a month, with no evidence of  disease and normal blood counts. In the second study, among the 28 adults and adolescents with  cancer that  had  not responded to  two or more previous tre atments, five (18%) had a complete  response to treatment. In both studies, more patients had a partial response to Atriance treatment,  with blood counts returning towards normal levels.
