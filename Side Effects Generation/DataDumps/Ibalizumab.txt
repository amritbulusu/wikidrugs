Results from a previous Phase II of ibalizumab, reported by the original developer [[Tanox]] in 2006,<ref name="studyresults">{{cite web| url=http://www.aegis.com/default.asp?req=http://www.aegis.com/news/pr/2006/PR060501.html| title=Tanox Reports 48-Week Results From TNX-355 Phase 2 Clinical Trial| publisher=AEGiS| date=2006-05-02}}</ref> showed that persons with HIV who received the drug, in combination with an optimized background regimen (OBR), maintained a considerably greater reduction in [[viral load]] and experienced a [[statistically significant]] increase in [[CD4+]] cells than did patients given [[placebo]] in combination with OBR. Thus, pending results of further trials, it is one of a limited number of viable alternative strategies to contain the virus without recourse to antiretroviral drug cocktails or a vaccine.

== Development ==
Ibalizumab is being developed by [[TaiMed Biologics]] but was first developed by Tanox, now part of [[Genentech]]. As part of Genentech's takeover of Tanox, the patent for ibalizumab was sold to TaiMed Biologics, a biotech company formed in 2007 with support from the Taiwanese Government through a $20 million investment by the state-owned National Development Fund.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://seekingalpha.com/article/47462-genentech-partners-with-taiwan-company-on-aids-drug |title=Genentech Partners with Taiwan Company on AIDS Drug| work=Seeking Alpha| date=2007-09-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2007/09/15/2003378907 |title=Government pushes biotech industry |work=Taipei Times |date=2007-09-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.biohouston.org/en/rel/?18 |title=Tanox's AIDS Drug Survives |work=BioHouston |date=2008-04-11}}</ref>
