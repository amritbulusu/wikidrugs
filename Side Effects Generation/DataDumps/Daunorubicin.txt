==Medical uses==
It slows or stops the growth of cancer cells in the body. Treatment is usually performed together with other chemotherapy drugs (such as [[cytarabine]]), and its administration depends on the type of tumor and the degree of response.

In addition to its major use in treating [[acute myeloid leukemia|AML]], daunorubicin is also used to treat [[neuroblastoma]]. Daunorubicin has been used with other chemotherapy agents to treat the blastic phase of [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]].

Daunorubicin is also used as the starting material for semi-synthetic manufacturing of [[doxorubicin]], [[epirubicin]] and [[idarubicin]].

== Mechanism of action ==
Similar to [[doxorubicin]], daunorubicin interacts with DNA by [[Intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalation]] and inhibition of macromolecular [[biosynthesis]].<ref name="fornari">{{cite journal |vauthors=Fornari FA, Randolph JK, Yalowich JC, Ritke MK, Gewirtz DA |title=Interference by doxorubicin with DNA unwinding in MCF-7 breast tumor cells |journal=[[Molecular Pharmacology|Mol Pharmacol]] |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=649–56 |date=April 1994 |pmid=8183243}}</ref><ref name="momparler">{{cite journal |vauthors=Momparler RL, Karon M, Siegel SE, Avila F |title=Effect of adriamycin on DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis in cell-free systems and intact cells |journal=Cancer Res |volume=36 |issue=8 |pages=2891–5 |date=August 1976 |pmid=1277199 |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/reprint/36/8/2891 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205063327/http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/reprint/36/8/2891 |archivedate=2009-02-05 |df= }}</ref> This inhibits the progression of the enzyme [[topoisomerase II]], which relaxes supercoils in DNA for [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]. Daunorubicin stabilizes the topoisomerase II complex after it has broken the DNA chain for replication, preventing the DNA double helix from being resealed and thereby stopping the process of [[DNA replication|replication]].
On binding to DNA, daunomycin [[intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalates]], with its daunosamine residue directed toward the minor groove. It has the highest preference for two adjacent G/C [[base pair]]s flanked on the 5' side by an A/T base pair.  Crystallography shows that daunomycin induces a local unwinding angle of 8°, and other conformational disturbances of adjacent and second-neighbour base pairs.<ref>{{Cite journal |title = Molecular structure of an anticancer drug-DNA complex: daunomycin plus d(CpGpTpApCpG) |author = G J Quigley |author2 = A H Wang |author3 = G Ughetto |author4 = G van der Marel |author5 = J H van Boom |author6 = A Rich |last-author-amp = yes |journal = PNAS |date = December 1980 |volume = 77 |issue = 12 |pages = 7204–7208 |url = http://www.pnas.org/content/77/12/7204.short |doi = 10.1073/pnas.77.12.7204 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924164649/http://www.pnas.org/content/77/12/7204.short |archivedate = 2015-09-24 |df =  }}</ref>

== History ==
{{See also|Anthracycline#History|Doxorubicin#History|History of cancer chemotherapy}}
In the 1950s, an [[Italy|Italian]] research company, Farmitalia Research Laboratories, began an organized effort to isolate anticancer compounds from soil-based [[microbe]]s. A soil sample was isolated from the area surrounding the [[Castel del Monte (Apulia)|Castel del Monte]], a 13th-century castle in [[Apulia]]. A new strain of ''[[Streptomyces peucetius]]'' which produced a red pigment was isolated, and an antibiotic was produced from this bacterium that was found to have good activity against [[Murinae|murine]] tumors. Since a group of [[France|French]] researchers discovered the same compound at about the same time, the two teams named the compound daunorubicin, combining the name ''[[Dauni]]'', a pre-Roman tribe that occupied the area of Italy where the compound was isolated, with the French word for [[ruby]], ''rubis'', describing the color.<ref name="weiss">{{cite journal |author=Weiss RB |title=The anthracyclines: will we ever find a better doxorubicin? |journal=Seminars in Oncology |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=670–86 |date=December 1992 |pmid=1462166}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 5332105 | volume=60 | title=Clinical trials in Plasmodium falciparum malaria with a long-acting sulphonamide | year=1966 | journal=Trans.

However, by 1967, it was recognized that daunorubicin could produce fatal cardiac toxicity.<ref name="TanC">{{cite journal |vauthors=Tan C, Tasaka H, Yu KP, Murphy ML, Karnofsky DA |title=Daunomycin, an antitumor antibiotic, in the treatment of neoplastic disease.

In 2015-16, a team at [[Ohio State University]] "showed that, by carefully manipulating strands of viral DNA, an origami structure with complex folds can be created in just 10 minutes. Incredibly, these structures are only 100 nanometers across – that’s 1,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair. Small volumes of daunorubicin can be wrapped up in these minuscule pods, which can then be released into a leukemia cell-filled environment."  http://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/researchers-kill-drug-resistant-leukemia-cells-using-dna-trojan-horse-attack

==Route of administration==
Daunorubicin should only be administered in a rapid [[intravenous infusion]]. It should not be administered [[intramuscular]]ly or [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous]]ly, since it may cause extensive tissue [[necrosis]].
It should also never be administered [[intrathecal]]ly (into the [[spinal canal]]), as this will cause extensive damage to the [[nervous system]] and may lead to [[death]]. Daunorubicin has been used intravitreally (inside the eye) for the purposes of preventing proliferative vitreoretinopathy, a common complication following retinal detachment surgery, but has not been found to be effective and is not used for any other ophthalmic purposes at this time.<ref>{{cite journal | author= Mortensen, ME | title= Inadvertent intrathecal injection of daunorubicin with fatal outcome | journal=Med Pediatr Oncol| year= 1992 | volume= 20 | issue= 3 | pages= 249–253 | pmid= 1574039|display-authors=etal | doi=10.1002/mpo.2950200315}}</ref>
