'''Sterling Drug''' was an American global pharmaceutical company, known as '''Sterling-Winthrop, Inc.''' after the merger with '''Winthrop-Stearns Inc.''' (which resulted from the merger of ''Winthrop Chemical Company Inc.'' and  ''Frederick Stearns & Company''). It was formerly known as ''Sterling Winthrop Pharmaceuticals'', whose primary product lines included [[Radiocontrast|diagnostic imaging agents]], hormonal products, [[cardiovascular]] products, [[analgesic]]s, [[antihistamine]]s and muscle relaxants.

Chemical compounds produced by this company were often known by their manufacturing code which consisted of the abbreviation WIN (for '''Win'''throp) followed by a number. For example, [[WIN 18,320]] was [[nalidixic acid]], the first quinolone [[antibiotic]].<ref name=jac2003>{{Cite journal| last1 = Emmerson | first1 = A. M.| last2 = Jones    | first2 = A.

==History==

===1910s===
The Company was established in 1901 (then called ''Neuralgyline Co.'') in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], by Albert H. Diebold and William E. Weiss, a pharmacist.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} At the end of [[World War I]] in 1918, Sterling purchased the US assets of a German company now known as [[Bayer|Bayer AG]] for US $5.3 million. This purchase was directed under the [[Alien Property Custodian]] Act. In 1919, Sterling sold its dye division for $2.5 million to the ''Grasselli Chemical Company'' (based in [[Linden, New Jersey]]), which employed many former Bayer personnel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colorantshistory.org/GeneralAnilineLinden.html |title=General Aniline Linden, New Jersey |accessdate=August 13, 2007}}</ref>

===1920s===
A 1920 agreement between Sterling and Bayer AG granted Sterling the rights to the "Bayer" brand to sell aspirin. In return, Bayer was allowed back into its former Latin American markets. In 1922, 50% of Sterling's new holding company, ''Winthrop'', was given to the German Bayer company, while the American Bayer retained the rights to use Bayer brand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.h-net.org/~business/bhcweb/publications/BEHprint/v023n1/p0201-p0211.pdf |title=Foreigh Trade Strategies of I.G.

===1940s===
In 1940, a cross-contamination from equipment sharing resulted in Winthrop Chemical producing contaminated [[sulfathiazole]] tablets contaminated with phenobarbital. Each [[sulfathiazole]] tablet was contaminated with about 350&nbsp;mg of phenobarbital. An investigation by US [[Food and Drug Administration]] and the findings resulted in actions. The incident was influential in the introduction of [[Good Manufacturing Practice]]s for drugs.<ref name="Pepling2005">{{cite journal

===1960s to 1970s===
In 1967, Sterling Drug acquired Lehn & Fink, the makers of [[Lysol]], Resolve, and [[d-CON]]. In 1974, Sterling opened a manufacturing plant in [[McPherson, Kansas]]. The various companies which would eventually acquire Sterling chose to keep the factory open.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===1980s to 1990s===
In 1988, Sterling was acquired by [[Eastman Kodak]] for $5.1 billion.<ref name=SterlingHist>{{cite journal|first1 = Joseph C.|last1 = Collins|first2 = John R.|last2 = Gwilt|url = http://www.scs.illinois.edu/~mainzv/HIST/bulletin_open_access/v25-1/v25-1%20p22-27.pdf|title = The Life Cycle of Sterling Drug, Inc.|journal = [[Bull.

In August 1994, Kodak sold the remainder of Sterling Winthrop, including its [[over the counter]] drug business which had been generating about $1 billion in revenue annually, to the British firm SmithKline Beecham for US $2.925 billion cash.<ref name=AP>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-08-30/business/fi-32940_1_health-products-business|title=Kodak to Sell Remaining Sterling Winthrop Unit : Drugs: SmithKline Beecham will buy the consumer health products business for $2.925 billion.|accessdate=May 3, 2013|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|author=Associated Press|date=August 30, 1994}}</ref>

Bayer was a losing bidder for the purchase of Sterling Winthrop, but in September 1994, it purchased the over the counter division of Sterling Winthrop in the US, Canada and Puerto Rico from SmithKline Beecham for $1 billion. Bayer also re-acquired the brand rights to the "Bayer Aspirin" name it had lost because of [[World War I]].<ref name=latsept1994>{{cite news|last=Olmos|first=David|title=German Firm to Reclaim Bayer Aspirin Name : Drugs: It will acquire Sterling Winthrop's over-the-counter business and recover the rights it lost after WWI|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-09-13/business/fi-38019_1_bayer-aspirin|accessdate=May 3, 2013|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 14, 1994}}</ref>

Spinoffs from the sale of Sterling include [[Starwin Products]], created in 1987 from Sterling’s original branch in [[Ghana]]. The Lehn & Fink division was acquired by Reckitt & Colman (now [[Reckitt Benckiser]]) at the time of the deal.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-09-30/business/9409300257_1_lysol-philip-morris-usa-clorox|title=Solid Player Leaps To Big Leagues With Lysol Buy|date=September 30, 1994|accessdate=April 9, 2017}}</ref>
