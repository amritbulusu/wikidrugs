'''Aganirsen''' (previously '''GS-101''') is a 25 mer DNA antisense [[oligonucleotide]] therapeutic inhibiting [[insulin receptor substrate-1]] ([[IRS1|IRS-1]]), which is being investigated as a topical treatment for ocular [[neovascularization]]. Aganirsen is a candidate for the treatment of ocular neovascularization in patients suffering from front of the eye (cornea) or back of the eye (retinal) diseases, including progressive corneal neovascularization in patients suffering from infectious [[keratitis]] and wet [[age related macular degeneration]] (AMD).

Aganirsen actively inhibits the production of IRS-1 by binding IRS-1 [[mRNA]] ([[antisense therapy]]). Aganirsen therefore induces an upstream inhibition of the neovascularization pathway, most notably by inhibiting excess [[VEGF]] and [[Il-1β]] expression.

==Structure==
Aganirsen is a 25-mer (5’-TATCCGGAGGGCTCGCCATGCTGCT-3’), first-generation [[antisense oligonucleotide]] (phosphorothioate linkage).  Aganirsen has a molecular mass of 8036 (Da), a melting point of approximately 64.2&nbsp;°C, and a GC content of 64%. Aganirsen is highly soluble in water.

IRS-1 is an intracellular docking protein deprived of enzymatic activity.<ref>Sun, Xiao Jian, "Structure of the insulin receptor substrate IRS-1 defines a unique signal transduction protein."

In April 2007, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) granted Gene Signal orphan designation for aganirsen for the prevention of [[corneal graft rejection]] associated with excessive neovascularisation of the host cornea (EMEA/COMP/108186/2007).<ref>http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/orphans/2009/11/human_orphan_000451.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d12b</ref> In April 2014, the EMA also granted Aganirsen an Orphan drug designation for ischemic Central retinal vein Occlusion (iCRVO).<ref>http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Committee_meeting_report/2014/04/WC500165377.pdf</ref> A randomised, double-masked, 3-group, placebo-controlled trial (STRONG Study) has received European Health Directorate (FP-7) funding to assess the drug’s efficacy in reducing the rate of anterior and posterior segment neovascularisation and Neovascular Glaucoma (NVG) development after ischemic CRVO.<ref>Lorenz, K., The STRONG study.

==Delivery==
Aganirsen is under investigation for [[Topical medication|topical delivery]] (eye drops and eye emulsion). Toxicology studies in rabbits and humans revealed that aganirsen was well tolerated independently of the concentration delivered.<ref>Cloutier et al « Antiangiogenic activity of Aganirsen in primate and rodent models of retinal neovascular disease after topical administration: IOVS, March 2012, Vol. 53, No.3</ref>
