==Medical uses==
Bupivacaine is indicated for local infiltration, [[peripheral nerve block]], sympathetic nerve block, and [[epidural]] and caudal blocks.  It is sometimes used in combination with [[epinephrine]] to prevent systemic absorption and extend the duration of action.  The 0.75% (most concentrated) formulation is used in [[retrobulbar block]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Lexicomp|title=Bupivacaine (Lexi-Drugs)|url=http://www.online.lexi.com|accessdate=20 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410053005/http://online.lexi.com/|archivedate=10 April 2014|df=}}</ref>   It is the most commonly used local anesthetic in epidural anesthesia during labor, as well as in postoperative pain management.<ref name="Miller">{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Ronald D.|title=Basics of Anesthesia|date=November 2, 2006|publisher=Churchill Livingstone}}</ref>

==Contraindications==
Bupivacaine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity reactions to bupivacaine or amino-amide anesthetics.  It is also contraindicated in obstetrical paracervical blocks and intravenous regional anaesthesia ([[Bier block]]) because of potential risk of tourniquet failure and systemic absorption of the drug and subsequent [[cardiac arrest]].  The 0.75% formulation is contraindicated in epidural anesthesia during labor because of the association with refractory cardiac arrest.<ref name="Lexicomp"/>

==Adverse effects==

Compared to other local anaesthetics, bupivacaine is markedly [[cardiotoxic]]. However, [[adverse drug reaction]]s (ADRs) are rare when it is administered correctly. Most ADRs are caused by accelerated absorption from the injection site, unintentional intravascular injection, or slow metabolic degradation.  However, [[allergy|allergic]] reactions can rarely occur.<ref name="Lexicomp"/>

Clinically significant adverse events result from systemic absorption of bupivacaine and primarily involve the central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular system.  CNS effects typically occur at lower [[blood plasma]] concentrations.  Initially, cortical inhibitory pathways are selectively inhibited, causing symptoms of neuronal excitation.  At higher plasma concentrations, both inhibitory and excitatory pathways are inhibited, causing CNS depression and potentially coma.  Higher plasma concentrations also lead to cardiovascular effects, though cardiovascular collapse may also occur with low concentrations.<ref>{{cite book|title=Australian Medicines Handbook|date=2006|publisher=Adelaide|isbn=0-9757919-2-3}}</ref>  Adverse CNS effects may indicate impending cardiotoxicity and should be carefully monitored.<ref name=Lexicomp>{{cite web|title=Bupivacaine (Lexi-Drugs)|url=http://www.online.lexi.com|accessdate=20 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410053005/http://online.lexi.com/|archivedate=10 April 2014|df=}}</ref>

* CNS: circumoral numbness, facial tingling, [[vertigo]], [[tinnitus]], restlessness, anxiety, dizziness, [[seizure]], [[coma]]
* Cardiovascular: [[hypotension]], [[arrhythmia]], [[bradycardia]], [[heart block]], [[cardiac arrest]]<ref name="Miller"/><ref name="Lexicomp"/>

Toxicity can also occur in the setting of subarachnoid injection during high spinal anesthesia.  These effects include: [[parasthesia]], [[paralysis]], [[apnea]], [[hypoventilation]], [[fecal incontinence]], and [[urinary incontinence]].  Additionally, bupivacaine can cause [[chondrolysis]] after continuous infusion into a joint space.<ref name="Lexicomp"/>

Bupivacaine has caused several deaths when the epidural anaesthetic has been administered intravenously accidentally.<ref>[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=104790 ABS-CBN Interactive: Filipino nurse dies in UK due to wrong use of anaesthetic]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=Level C |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===Pregnancy and lactation===
Bupivacaine crosses the placenta and is a pregnancy category C drug.  However, it is approved for use at term in obstetrical anesthesia.  Bupivacaine is excreted in breast milk.  Risks of discontinuing breast feeding versus discontinuing bupivacaine should be discussed with the patient.<ref name="Lexicomp"/>

==Mechanism of action==
Bupivacaine binds to the intracellular portion of voltage-gated [[sodium channels]] and blocks sodium influx into [[neuron|nerve cells]], which prevents [[depolarization]].  Without depolarization, no initiation or conduction of a pain signal can occur.

==Pharmacokinetics==
The rate of systemic absorption of bupivacaine and other local anesthetics is dependent upon the dose and concentration of drug administered, the route of administration, the vascularity of the administration site, and the presence or absence of epinephrine in the preparation.<ref name="Package Insert">{{cite web|title=bupivacaine hydrochloride (Bupivacaine Hydrochloride) injection, solution|url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/archives/fdaDrugInfo.cfm?archiveid=1828|publisher=FDA|accessdate=20 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421052148/http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/archives/fdaDrugInfo.cfm?archiveid=1828|archivedate=21 April 2014|df=}}</ref> 
* Onset of action (route and dose-dependent): 1-17 min
* Duration of action (route and dose-dependent): 2-9 hr
* Half life: neonates, 8.1 hr, adults: 2.7 hr
* Time to peak plasma concentration (for peripheral, epidural, or caudal block): 30-45 min
* Protein binding: about 95%
* Metabolism: hepatic
* Excretion: renal (6% unchanged)<ref name="Lexicomp"/>

==Chemical structure==
Like [[lidocaine]], bupivacaine is an amino-amide anesthetic; the aromatic head and the hydrocarbon chain are linked by an [[amide bond]] rather than an ester as in earlier local anesthetics.  As a result, the amino-amide anesthetics are more stable and less likely to cause allergic reactions.  Unlike lidocaine, the terminal amino portion of bupivacaine (as well as mepivacaine, ropivacaine, and levobupivacaine) is contained within a [[piperidine]] ring; these agents are known as pipecholyl xylidines.<ref name="Miller"/>

==Cost==
Bupivacaine is available as a [[generic medication]] and is not very expensive.<ref name=AHFS2015/><ref name=Ric2015/> The wholesale cost of a vial of bupivacaine is about US$2.10.<ref name=ERC2015/>

==Research==
[[Levobupivacaine]] is the (''S'')-(–)-[[enantiomer]] of bupivacaine, with a longer duration of action, producing less vasodilation.  Durect Corporation is developing a biodegradable, controlled-release drug delivery system for after surgery.  It has currently completed a phase-III clinical trial.<ref>Bupivacaine Effectiveness and Safety in SABER™ Trial (BESST); {{cite web |url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01052012 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227221026/http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01052012 |archivedate=2011-12-27 |df= }} ClinicalTrials.gov processed this record on February 29, 2012.</ref>
