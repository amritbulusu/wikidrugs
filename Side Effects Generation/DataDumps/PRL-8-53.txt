'''PRL-8-53''' is a [[nootropic]] [[research chemical]] [[derivative (chemistry)|derived]] from [[benzoic acid]] and [[phenylmethylamine]] (Benzylamine) that has been shown to act as a [[hypermnesia|hypermnesic]] drug in humans; it was first synthesized by medical chemistry professor [[Nikolaus Hansl]] at [[Creighton University]] in the 1970s as part of his work on amino ethyl meta benzoic acid esters.<ref name="trial">{{cite journal |author2=Beverley T. Mead |title=PRL-8-53: Enhanced learning and subsequent retention in humans as a result of low oral doses of new psychotropic agent|journal=Psychopharmacology|year=1978|volume=56|issue=3|pages=249–253|doi=10.1007/BF00432846|pmid=418433|last1=Hansl|first1=NR}}</ref><ref>[http://www.google.com/patents/US3870715 US Patent 3870715 A: Substituted amino ethyl meta benzoic acid esters]</ref>

==Nootropic effects==
{{medref|section|reason=A primary report of a single small scale clinical trial is insufficient to meet [[WP:MEDRS]] guidelines|date=July 2015}}
A single study in humans was reported in 1978.  The [[double-blind]] trial of PRL-8-53 in 47 healthy volunteers measured its effects on a variety of cognitive measures. 5&nbsp;mg of the drug was administered orally 2–2.5 hours before the study tasks.<ref name="trial" /> Overall improvements in recollection differed based on how many words were recalled under placebo, with the poor performers (six words or fewer) experiencing a 87.5-105% increase in recollection and the high performers (eight or more words) a 7.9-14% increase which failed to reach statistical significance; when controlling for subjects over the age of 30 only, a 108-152% increase was noted. The researchers noted that this was likely a result of a ceiling effect due to many of their subjects scoring close to 100% on the recall test even on placebo.<ref name="trial" /> No side effects were reported during the trial.<ref name="trial" />

==Mechanism of action==
The exact [[mechanism of action]] of PRL-8-53 remains unknown. Doses up to 200 mg/kg are not observed to have stimulant properties, and a dosage of 20 mg/kg does not potentiate the effects of [[dextroamphetamine]] in rats.<ref name="trial" /> It displays possible [[cholinergic]] properties, and potentiates [[dopamine]] while partially inhibiting [[serotonin]]. PRL-8-53 reverses the [[catatonic]] and [[Ptosis (eyelid)|ptotic]] effects of [[reserpine]].<ref name="trial" /><ref name="toxicity" />

==Toxicity==

PRL-8-53 is relatively non-toxic, with an oral {{LD50}} in mice of 860&nbsp;mg/kg, giving the drug a high [[therapeutic index]]. Doses above 8&nbsp;mg/kg have brief [[hypotensive]] effects in the canine. High doses depress motor activity in the rat and mouse, with the [[Effective dose (pharmacology)|ED<sub>50</sub>]] for a 50% reduction in motor activity of mice at 160&nbsp;mg/kg. PRL-8-53 displays [[Antispasmodic|spasmolytic]] effects.<ref name="toxicity">{{Cite journal
