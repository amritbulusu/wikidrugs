'''Sodium cyclamate''' (sweetener code 952) is an [[artificial sweetener]]. It is 30&ndash;50 times sweeter than sucrose (table sugar), making it the least potent of the commercially used artificial sweeteners. It is often used with other artificial sweeteners, especially [[saccharin]]; the mixture of 10 parts cyclamate to 1 part saccharin is common and masks the off-tastes of both sweeteners.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jim Smith, Lily Hong-Shum|title=Food Additives Data Book|date=Apr 15, 2008|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|page=960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7T8c12ifxaYC&pg=PA959&lpg=PA959&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9781405172417}}</ref> It is less expensive than most sweeteners, including [[sucralose]], and is stable under heating.

==Chemistry==
Cyclamate is the [[sodium]] or [[calcium]] [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] of [[cyclamic acid]] (cyclohexanesulfamic acid), which itself is prepared by the [[sulfonation]] of [[cyclohexylamine]]. This can be accomplished by reacting cyclohexylamine with either [[sulfamic acid]] or [[sulfur trioxide]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McKetta Jr|first1=John J.|title=Sweeteners, High Intensity|journal=Encyclopedia of Chemical Processing and Design|date=Jun 19, 1996|volume= 56|page=72|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gb9UKnQEbeUC&pg=PA72&lpg=PA72&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9780824726072}}</ref>

Prior to 1973, Abbott Laboratories produced sodium cyclamate (Sucaryl) by a mixture of ingredients including the addition of pure sodium (flakes or rods suspended in kerosene) with cyclohexylamine, chilled and filtered through a high speed centrifugal separator, dried, granulated and micro-pulverised for powder or tablet usage.

==History==
[[File:Funny Face drink mix 1969.jpg|thumb|right|Funny Face [[drink mix]] packet from 1970-71 advertising "No Cyclamate - Just Add Sugar"]]
Cyclamate was discovered in 1937 at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]] by graduate student [[Michael Sveda]]. Sveda was working in the lab on the synthesis of anti-fever medication. He put his [[cigarette]] down on the lab bench, and, when he put it back in his mouth, he discovered the sweet taste of cyclamate.<ref>{{cite book |author=Packard, Vernal S. |title=Processed foods and the consumer: additives, labeling, standards, and nutrition |publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]] |location=Minneapolis |year=1976 |pages=332 |isbn=0-8166-0778-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/21/business/michael-sveda-the-inventor-of-cyclamates-dies-at-87.html Michael Sveda, the Inventor Of Cyclamates, Dies at 87 - New York Times<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The patent for cyclamate was purchased by [[DuPont]] but later sold to [[Abbott Laboratories]], which undertook the necessary studies and submitted a New Drug Application in 1950. Abbott intended to use cyclamate to mask the bitterness of certain drugs such as [[antibiotics]] and [[pentobarbital]]. In 1958, it was designated GRAS ([[Generally Recognized as Safe]]) by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]]. Cyclamate was marketed in tablet form for use by diabetics as an alternative tabletop sweetener, as well as in a liquid form. As cyclamate is stable to heat, it was and is marketed as suitable for use in cooking and baking.

In 1966, a study reported that some intestinal bacteria could desulfonate cyclamate to produce [[cyclohexylamine]], a compound suspected to have some chronic toxicity in animals. Further research resulted in a 1969 study that found the common 10:1 cyclamate:saccharin mixture to increase the incidence of [[bladder cancer]] in [[rat]]s. The released study was showing that eight out of 240 rats fed a mixture of saccharin and cyclamates, at levels of humans ingesting 550 cans of diet soda per day, developed bladder tumors.<ref>{{cite web|title=Not all are convinced by sweet science|url=http://www.canada.com/cityguides/hamilton/info/story.html?id=de4d77a6-d926-45c2-8bc3-d61797d89cc0}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Case against Sugar|last=Taubes|first=Gary|publisher=Portobello books|year=2017|isbn=9781846276378|location=London, England|pages=143-144}}</ref>

Sales continued to expand, and in 1969, annual sales of cyclamate had reached $1 billion, which increased pressure from public safety watchdogs to restrict the usage of cyclamate. In October 1969, [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health, Education & Welfare]] Secretary [[Robert Finch (American politician)|Robert Finch]], bypassing [[Food and Drug Administration]] Commissioner [[Herbert L. Ley, Jr.]], removed the GRAS designation from cyclamate and banned its use in general-purpose foods, though it remained available for restricted use in dietary products with additional labeling; in October 1970, the FDA, under a new Commissioner, banned cyclamate completely from all food and drug products in the United States.<ref name="The Search for Sweetness">{{cite journal|last1=Chedd|first1=Grahm|title=The Search for Sweetness|journal=New Scientist|date=May 9, 1974|volume=62|issue=897|page=299|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zTFpyBr4WvgC&pg=PA299#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>

Abbott Laboratories claimed that its own studies were unable to reproduce the 1969 study's results, and, in 1973, Abbott petitioned the FDA to lift the ban on cyclamate. This petition was eventually denied in 1980 by FDA Commissioner [[Jere Goyan]].<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> Abbott Labs, together with the [[Calorie Control Council]] (a political [[Lobbying|lobby]] representing the diet foods industry), filed a second petition in 1982. Although the FDA has stated that a review of all available evidence does not implicate cyclamate as a [[carcinogen]] in mice or rats,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/documentStore/c/y/b/cyb51c00/Scyb51c00.pdf|title=FDA Talk Paper, NAS Report on Cyclamate}}</ref> cyclamate remains banned from food products in the United States.

In 2000 a paper was published describing the results of a 24 year long experiment in which 16 monkeys were fed a normal diet and twenty-one monkeys were fed either 100 or 500 mg/kg cyclamate per day; the higher dose corresponds to about 30 cans of a diet beverage. Two of the high-dosed monkeys and one of the lower-dosed monkeys were found to have malignant cancer, each with a different kind of cancer, and three benign tumors were found. The authors concluded that the study failed to demonstrate that cyclamate was carcinogenic because the cancers were all different and there was no way to link cyclamate to each of them.<ref name=one>{{cite journal|title=Artificial sweeteners—do they bear a carcinogenic risk?|authors=Weihrauch MR, Diehl V|journal=Ann Oncol|year=2004|volume=15|issue=10|pages=1460–5|pmid=15367404|url=http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/10/1460.long|doi=10.1093/annonc/mdh256}}</ref> The substance did not show any DNA-damaging properties in DNA repair assays.<ref name=one/>

== Legal status ==

Cyclamate is approved as a sweetener in at least 130 countries.<ref>http://www.cyclamate.org/pdf/Cyclamate_worldwidestatus.pdf</ref>
