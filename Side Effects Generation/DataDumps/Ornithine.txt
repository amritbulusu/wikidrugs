'''Ornithine''' is a [[non-proteinogenic amino acid]] that plays a role in the [[urea cycle]]. Ornithine is abnormally accumulated in the body in [[ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency]]. The [[radical (chemistry)|radical]] is '''ornithyl'''.

==Role in urea cycle==
<small>L</small>-Ornithine is one of the products of the action of the enzyme [[arginase]] on <small>L</small>-[[arginine]], creating [[urea]]. Therefore, ornithine is a central part of the urea cycle, which allows for the disposal of excess [[nitrogen]]. Ornithine is recycled and, in a manner, is a catalyst. First, ammonia is converted into [[carbamoyl phosphate]] ({{chem|H|2|NC(O)OPO|3|2−}}). Ornithine is converted into a urea derivative at the δ (terminal) nitrogen by carbamoyl phosphate synthetase. Another nitrogen is added from [[aspartate]], producing the denitrogenated [[fumarate]], and the resulting [[arginine]] (a [[guanidinium]] compound) is hydrolysed back to ornithine, producing urea. The nitrogens of urea come from the ammonia and aspartate, and the nitrogen in ornithine remains intact.

Ornithine is not an amino acid coded for by [[DNA]], that is, not [[Proteinogenic amino acid|proteinogenic]]. However, in mammalian non-hepatic tissues, the main use of the urea cycle is in arginine biosynthesis, so, as an intermediate in metabolic processes, ornithine is quite important.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01795749 |first1=Arthur L.|last1= Weber |first2= Stanley L.|last2= Miller |title=Reasons for the Occurrence of the Twenty Coded Protein Amino Acids |journal=J.

==Other reactions==
Ornithine, via the action of [[ornithine decarboxylase]] (E.C. 4.1.1.17), is the starting point for the synthesis of [[polyamine]]s such as [[putrescine]].

In bacteria, such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', ornithine can be synthesized from [[glutamic acid|<small>L</small>-glutamate]].<ref>{{Cite journal | url = http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/reaction/AminoAcid/Orn.html | title = Ornithine Biosynthesis | accessdate = 2007-08-17 | publisher = School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary, University of London }}</ref>

==Research==

===Exercise fatigue===
<small>L</small>-Ornithine supplementation attenuated fatigue in subjects in a placebo-controlled study using a cycle ergometer. The results suggested that <small>L</small>-ornithine has an antifatigue effect in increasing the efficiency of energy consumption and promoting the excretion of ammonia.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 19083482 | year = 2008 | last1 = Sugino | first1 = T. | last2 = Shirai | first2 = T. | last3 = Kajimoto | first3 = Y. | last4 = Kajimoto | first4 = O. | title = L-ornithine supplementation attenuates physical fatigue in healthy volunteers by modulating lipid and amino acid metabolism | volume = 28 | issue = 11 | pages = 738–43 | doi = 10.1016/j.nutres.2008.08.008 | journal = Nutrition research}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 20717126 | year = 2010 | last1 = Demura | first1 = S. | last2 = Yamada | first2 = T. | last3 = Yamaji | first3 = S. | last4 = Komatsu | first4 = M. | last5 = Morishita | first5 = K. | title = The effect of L-ornithine hydrochloride ingestion on performance during incremental exhaustive ergometer bicycle exercise and ammonia metabolism during and after exercise | volume = 64 | issue = 10 | pages = 1166–71 | doi = 10.1038/ejcn.2010.149 | journal = European journal of clinical nutrition}}</ref>

===Weightlifting supplement===
[[Amino acid]] supplements, including <small>L</small>-ornithine, are frequently marketed to bodybuilders and weightlifters with claims for increasing levels of [[human growth hormone]] (HGH), muscle mass and strength. A clinical study reported that L-ornithine at 2 g/d did not increase HGH.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Fogelholm |first = G.
