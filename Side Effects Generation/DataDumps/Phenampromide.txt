'''Phenampromide''' is an [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] from the ampromide family of drugs, related to other drugs such as [[propiram]] and [[diampromide]]. It was invented in the 1960s<ref>Portoghese PS. Stereochemical Studies on Medicinal Agents II. Absolute Configuration of (-)-Phenampromide. ''Journal of Medicinal Chemistry''. 1965 Mar;8:147-50.</ref> by American Cyanamid Co.<ref>US Patent 3016382</ref> 
Although never given a general release, it was trialled and  50mg codeine â‰ˆ 60mg phenampromide. Tests on the 2 isomers showed that all of the analgesic effects were caused by the (S) isomer. In the book <ref>Opioids - R.Lenz et all</ref> a 4-benzyl group added to the piperidine-ring produces a drug some x60 morphine. When overlaid with the most potent isomer of [[3-methylfentanyl]], the 2 compounds overlay perfectly. This is of academic interest only since the synthetic complexity is beyond clandestine drug manufacturers.

Phenampromide produces similar effects to other opioids, including [[analgesia]], [[sedation]], [[dizziness]] and [[nausea]].

Phenampromide is in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act 1970 of the United States as a Narcotic with ACSCN 9638 with a zero aggregate manufacturing quota as of 2014.  The free base conversion ratio for salts includes 0.88 for the hydrochloride.<ref>http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/quotas/2014/fr0825.htm</ref>  It is listed under the Single Convention for the Control of Narcotic Substances 1961 and is controlled in most countries in the same fashion as is morphine.
