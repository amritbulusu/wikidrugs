'''Cilnidipine''' ([[International Non-proprietary Name|INN]]) is a [[calcium channel blocker]]. It is a calcium antagonist accompanied with [[L-type calcium channel|<small>L</small>-type]] and [[N-type calcium channel|<small>N</small>-type calcium channel]] blocking functions. It was jointly developed by [[Fuji Viscera Pharmaceutical Company]] and [[Ajinomoto]],<nowiki/> and was approved to enter the market and be used as an [[anti-hypertensive]] in 1995.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Unlike other calcium antagonists, cilnidipine can act on the <small>N</small>-type calcium channel in addition to acting on the <small>L</small>-type calcium channel. Cilnidipine is approved for use in Japan, China, India, Korea, and some European countries to treat [[hypertension]]. 

== Medical uses ==
Cilnidipine decreases blood pressure and is used to treat hypertension and its [[Comorbidity|comorbidities]]. Due to its blocking action at the <small>N</small>-type and <small>L</small>-type calcium channel, cilnidipine dilates both [[arteriole]]s and [[venule]]s, reducing the pressure in the [[capillary bed]]. Cilnidipine is vasoselective and has a weak direct dromotropic effect, a strong vasodepressor effect, and an arrhythmia-inhibiting effect.

== Side effects ==
The side effects could be severe diziness, fast heartbeat, and swelling of face, lips, tongue, eyelids, hands and feet. Lesser side effects include stomach pain, diarrhea and hypotension.

[[Peripheral edema]], a common side effect from the use of [[amlodipine]], was reduced when patients were shifted to cilnidipine.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Minami|first=Junichi|last2=Kawano|first2=Yuhei|last3=Makino|first3=Yuriko|last4=Matsuoka|first4=Hiroaki|last5=Takishita|first5=Shuichi|date=2017-05-01|title=Effects of cilnidipine, a novel dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, on autonomic function, ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate in patients with essential hypertension|journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology|volume=50|issue=6|pages=615–620|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2125.2000.00299.x|issn=0306-5251|pmc=2015014|pmid=11136301}}</ref>

== Clinical benefits ==

Cilnidipine has enhanced [[lipophilicity]], leading to prolonged [[anti-hypertensive]] effects, correlated with occupancy of the binding site. In a 24-hour clinical assessment, once-daily administration of cilnidipine reduced blood pressure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Minami|first=Junichi|last2=Kawano|first2=Yuhei|last3=Making|first3=Yuriko|last4=Matsuoka|first4=Hiroaki|last5=Takishita|first5=Shuichi|date=2017-05-01|title=Effects of cilnidipine, a novel dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, on autonomic function, ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate in patients with essential hypertension|journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology|volume=50|issue=6|pages=615–620|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2125.2000.00299.x|issn=0306-5251|pmc=2015014|pmid=11136301}}</ref> The inhibitory effect on the [[N-type calcium channel|<small>N</small>-type Ca<sup>2+</sup>]] channel may bestow an additional clinical advantage for the treatment of hypertension, such as suppression of [[reflex tachycardia]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shetty|first=Ranjan|last2=Vivek|first2=G|last3=Naha|first3=Kushal|last4=Tumkur|first4=Anil|last5=Raj|first5=Abhinav|last6=Bairy|first6=K L|date=2017-05-01|title=Excellent Tolerance to Cilnidipine in Hypertensives with Amlodipine - Induced Edema|journal=North American Journal of Medical Sciences|volume=5|issue=1|pages=47–50|doi=10.4103/1947-2714.106203|issn=2250-1541|pmc=3560139|pmid=23378956}}</ref>

As [[catecholamine]]s induce platelet activation via [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>2</sub>-receptor]] on the platelet membrane, a decrease in [[norepinephrine]] levels caused by cilnidipine leads to attenuation of [[platelet activation]].

== Brand names ==
In Bangladesh, cilnidipine is marketed by [[The ACME Laboratories Ltd]] and [[Opsonin Pharma Limited]] under the brand names Duocard and CILDIP, respectively, available as both 5&nbsp;mg and 10&nbsp;mg. In India it is marketed by JBCPL{{expand acronym|date=September 2017}} under the brand name Cilacarand, available in 5&nbsp;mg, 10&nbsp;mg, 20&nbsp;mg and other doses.
In Japan it is marketed by [[Ajinomoto|Ajinomoto Pharmaceuticals]] under the brand name Atelec. In the United States it is available through different brands, including Atelec and Cilacar.
