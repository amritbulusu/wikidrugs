'''Almotriptan'''  (trade name '''Axert''' and others) is a [[triptan]] [[Pharmaceutical drug|drug]] discovered and developed by [[Almirall]] for the treatment of heavy [[migraine headache]].

== Medical uses ==
Almotriptan is prescribed to treat the acute headache phase of migraine attacks with or without [[Aura (symptom)|aura]].<ref name=Drugs-Almotriptan>{{cite web|title=Almotriptan Facts and Comparisons|url=http://www.drugs.com/cdi/almotriptan.html|publisher=Drugs.com|accessdate=7 October 2012}}</ref> Almotriptan is the only oral triptan approved in the USA for the treatment of migraine in adolescent from 12 to 17 years of age.{{fact|date=October 2016}}

=== Efficacy ===
The efficacy and tolerability of almotriptan has been studied in numerous randomised, control-led trials totaling more than 4800 adults with either moderate or severe attacks of migraine. Its efficacy is significantly more effective than placebo and alleviates [[nausea]], [[photophobia]] and [[phonophobia]] linked to migraine attacks. Almotriptan has similar efficacy as a standard dose of [[sumatriptan]], another triptan drug, and fewer adverse effects.<ref name=Keam2002 />

== Contraindications ==
As with other triptans, almotriptan should not be used in patients with a history, symptoms or signs of [[ischaemic heart disease]] (myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, documented silent ischaemia, Prinzmetal’s angina) or severe [[hypertension]] and uncontrolled mild or moderate hypertension.
Other contraindications are previous [[cerebrovascular accident]] (CVA) or [[transient ischaemic attack]] (TIA), [[peripheral vascular disease]], severe hepatic impairment, concomitant administration of [[ergotamine]], ergotamine derivatives (including methysergide) and other 5-HT1<sub>B/D</sub> agonists.

== Side effects ==
Almotriptan has proved to have an adverse effects profile similar to [[placebo]] when used following the [[Summary of Product Characteristics]] instructions (see references).

==Pharmacology ==
=== Mechanism of action ===
Like all triptans, almotriptan has a high and specific affinity for serotonin [[5-HT receptor|5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptors]]. Binding of the drug to the receptor leads to [[vasoconstriction]] of the cranial (brain) blood vessels and thus affects the redistribution of blood flow. Almotriptan significantly increases cerebral blood flow and reduces blood flow through extracerebral cranial vessels. Even though it affects cranial blood vessels a single standard dose of almotriptan has no clinically significant effect on blood pressure or heart rate in both young and elderly healthy volunteers. Larger doses seem to slightly increase blood pressure but not beyond clinical relevance.<ref name=Keam2002>{{cite journal|last=Keam|first=SJ|author2=Goa, KL|author3= Figgitt, DP|title=Almotriptan: a review of its use in migraine.|journal=Drugs|year=2002|volume=62|issue=2|pages=387–414|pmid=11817980|doi=10.2165/00003495-200262020-00010}}</ref>

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Almotriptan has linear [[pharmacokinetics]] up to the 16-fold standard dose. Its [[biological half-life]] is 3 hours, and its [[bioavailability]] 70%.
[[Cmax (pharmacology)|C<sub>max</sub>]] is observed 1.5–4 hours after oral administration, and approximately 50% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. Metabolism is mediated through the enzymes [[MAO-A]] and [[CYP3A4]] and [[CYP2D6]] oxidation.
Almotriptan [[Clearance (pharmacology)|clearance]] is moderately reduced in the elderly but does not require dose adjustment. Sex does not alter the pharmacokinetics of the drug. People with moderate-to-severe renal dysfunction are recommended to use only half the dose.<ref name=McEnroe2005>{{cite journal|last=McEnroe|first=JD|author2=Fleishaker, JC|title=Clinical pharmacokinetics of almotriptan, a serotonin 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist for the treatment of migraine.|journal=Clinical pharmacokinetics|year=2005|volume=44|issue=3|pages=237–46|pmid=15762767|doi=10.2165/00003088-200544030-00002}}<!--|accessdate=7 October 2012--></ref>

== Interactions ==
As mentioned previously, almotriptan is metabolized mainly by MAO-A and to lesser extent by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Studies of drugs used as preventive against migraine ([[propranolol]] and [[verapamil]]), anti-depressants ([[moclobemide]] and [[fluoxetine]]) yielded results that showed significant altering of the pharmacokinetics of almotriptan though they were deemed not clinically relevant.<ref name=Keam2002 />

== Society and culture ==
=== Brand names ===
Brand names include ''Axert'' (US, Canada), ''Almogran'' (Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, South Korea…), ''Almotrex'' (Italy), ''Almozen'' (Bulgaria and Poland) and ''Amignul'' (Spain).
