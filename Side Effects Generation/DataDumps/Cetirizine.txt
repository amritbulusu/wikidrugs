'''Cetirizine''', sold under the brand name '''Zyrtec''' among others, is a potent [[second-generation antihistamine]] used in the treatment of [[hay fever]], [[allergies]], [[angioedema]], and [[urticaria]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/561316|title=Medscape Log In|publisher=}}</ref> It acts as a [[binding selectivity|selective]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of the [[histamine]] [[H1 receptor|H<sub>1</sub> receptor]].

Second-generation antihistamines like cetirizine are less able to cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] and therefore have diminished effects on the [[central nervous system]] compared to first-generation drugs. As such, they are less likely to cause [[drowsiness]] or [[memory impairment]].

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Medical uses==

===Allergies===
Cetirizine's primary indication is for [[hay fever]] and other allergies. Because the symptoms of itching and redness in these conditions are caused by histamine acting on the H<sub>1</sub> receptor, blocking those receptors temporarily relieves those symptoms.

Cetirizine is also commonly prescribed to treat acute and (in particular cases) chronic [[urticaria]], more efficiently than any other second-generation antihistamine{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}.

===Rhinovirus infection===
[[Interleukin 6]] and [[interleukin 8]] have been shown to be elevated in acute respiratory distress syndrome.<ref name="pmid8406851">{{cite journal| last1=Chollet-Martin| first1=S| last2=Montravers| first2=P| last3=Gibert| first3=C| last4=Elbim| first4=C| last5=Desmonts| first5=JM| last6=Fagon| first6=JY| last7=Gougerot-Pocidalo| first7=MA| title=High levels of interleukin-8 in the blood and alveolar spaces of patients with pneumonia and adult respiratory distress syndrome| journal=Infection and immunity| volume=61| issue=11| pages=4553–9| year=1993| pmid=8406851| pmc=281204}}</ref> One recent study of airway epithelial cells showed that [[levocetirizine]], the active [[enantiomer]] of cetirizine, may have beneficial effects on the pathophysiologic changes related to human rhinovirus ([[rhinovirus|HRV]]) infection.<ref name="pmid19110001">{{cite journal| vauthors = Jang YJ, Wang JH, Kim JS, Kwon HJ, Yeo NK, Lee BJ| title = Levocetirizine inhibits rhinovirus-induced ICAM-1 and cytokine expression and viral replication in airway epithelial cells | journal = Antiviral Res.| volume = 81| issue = 3| pages = 226–33|date=March 2009| pmid = 19110001| doi = 10.1016/j.antiviral.2008.12.001}}</ref>

===Kimura's disease===
Cetirizine is an effective agent in treating the symptoms of [[Kimura's disease]] which predominantly affects the lymph nodes and soft tissue of the head and neck in the form of tumor-like lesions. Cetirizine's properties of being effective both in the treatment of [[pruritus]] (itching) and as an anti-inflammatory agent make it suitable for the treatment of the pruritus associated with these lesions.<ref name="kimura">{{cite journal|vauthors = Ben-Chetrit E, Amir G, Shalit M| title = Cetirizine: An effective agent in Kimura's disease| journal = Arthritis Rheum.| volume = 53| issue = 1|pages = 117–8|date=February 2005|doi = 10.1002/art.20908| pmid = 15696573}}</ref> In a 2005 study, the American College of Rheumatology conducted treatments initially using [[prednisone]], followed by steroid dosages and [[azathioprine]], [[omeprazole]], and [[calcium]] and [[vitamin D]] supplements over the course of two years.<ref name="kimura" /> The skin condition of the patient began to improve and the skin lesions lessened. However, there were symptoms of [[cushing syndrome|cushingoid]] and [[hirsutism]] observed before the patient was removed from the courses of steroids and placed on 10&nbsp;mg/day of cetirizine to prevent skin lesions;<ref name="kimura" /> an agent suitable for the treatment of pruritus associated with such lesions.<ref name="kimura" /> Asymptomatically, the patient's skin lesions disappeared after treatment with cetirizine, blood [[eosinophil]] counts became normal,<ref name="kimura" /> corticosteroid effects were resolved,<ref name="kimura" /> and a remission began within a period of two months.<ref name="kimura" /> It is also thought that the inhibition of eosinophils may be the key to treatment of Kimura's disease due to the role of eosinophils, rather than other cells with regards to the lesions of the skin.<ref name="kimura"/>

===Available forms===
Cetirizine is available in the form of 5 and 10&nbsp;mg [[tablet (pharmacy)|tablet]]s.<ref name="pmid14680442" />

==Adverse effects==
Commonly reported side effects of cetirizine include [[headache]] (16%), [[dry mouth]] (5.7%), [[drowsiness]] (5–20%), and [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] (5.6%), while more serious but rare side effects include [[cardiac failure]], [[tachycardia]], and [[edema]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Zyrtec Side Effects|url=http://www.drugs.com/sfx/zyrtec-side-effects.html|website=drugs.com|publisher=Drugs.com|accessdate=21 August 2015}}</ref>

===Withdrawal===
Long-term daily usage of cetirizine may result in what resembles antihistamine dependency. No official study has been conducted to determine how long a patient may take cetirizine daily before expecting to encounter withdrawal symptoms when treatment stops. Many patients seeking help with withdrawal symptoms report having taken cetirizine for more than three years, while others report having taken it for no longer than one week. <ref>{{cite web|title=Zyrtec Withdrawal Is a Nightmare|url=https://www.peoplespharmacy.com/2013/02/21/zyrtec-withdrawal-is-a-nightmare/|website=People's Pharmacy|accessdate=9 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Itching Withdrawal From Cetirizine Or Zyrtec|url=http://www.medschat.com/Discuss/Itching-Withdrawal-from-Cetirizine-or-Zyrtec-204553.htm|website=MedsChat.com|accessdate=9 September 2017}}</ref>

Insatiable, generalized itching is the most commonly-reported withdrawal side effect, though others have reported severe [[rebound effect|rebound]] of original, pre-treatment systems as well, including sneezing and runny nose. <ref>{{cite web|title=Cetirizine (Zyrtec) Withdrawal & Unbearable Itching|url=https://www.peoplespharmacy.com/2013/05/06/cetirizine-zyrtec-withdrawal-unbearable-itching/|website=People's Pharmacy|accessdate=9 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=addicted to zyrtec?|url=http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Allergy/addicted-to-zyrtec/show/600862|website=MedHelp|accessdate=9 September 2017}}</ref>

The 1-[(4-chlorophenylmethyl]-piperazine is alkylated with methyl (2-chloroethoxy)-acetate in the presence of sodium carbonate and xylene solvent to produce the Sn2 substitution product in 28% yield. Saponification of the acetate ester is done by refluxing with [[potash]] in absolute ethanol to afford a 56% yield of the potassium salt intermediate. This is then hydrolyzed with aqueous HCl and extracted to give an 81% yield of the carboxylic acid product.

Formerly prescription-only in many countries, cetirizine is now available without prescription in most countries. In some countries it is available over-the-counter only in packages containing seven or ten 10&nbsp;mg doses.

Like many other antihistamine medications, cetirizine is commonly prescribed in combination with [[pseudoephedrine]], a [[decongestant]]. These combinations are often marketed using the same brand name as the cetirizine with a "-D" suffix ('''Zyrtec-D''', '''Virlix-D''', etc.)
