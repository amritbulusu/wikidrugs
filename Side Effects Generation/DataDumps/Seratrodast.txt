==Medical uses==
Seratrodast is used to treat asthma.<ref name=Rolin2006rev/><ref name="Bronica2" />

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of seratrodast in pregnant women. The drug should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefits justify the risk to the fetus.<ref name="Bronica2" /> Seratrodast should not be used during lactation.<ref name="Bronica2">{{cite web|title=医療用医薬品 : ブロニカ (Japanese label)|url=http://www.kegg.jp/medicus-bin/japic_med?japic_code=00002634|publisher=KEGG|accessdate=8 March 2017|language=ja|date=October 2016}}</ref>

The safety and efficacy of seratrodast has not been established in children (<18 years of age).<ref name="Bronica2" />

==Contraindications and interactions==
Seratrodast should not be used in people with liver disease.<ref name="Bronica2" />

Use with [[paracetamol]] or with [[cephem]] antibiotics increases the risk of liver damage.  Use with [[aspirin]] increases the bioavailability of seratrodast.<ref name="Bronica2" />

==Adverse effects==
The most frequently observed (0.1 to 5%) adverse reactions include [[elevated transaminases]], nausea, loss of appetite, stomach discomfort, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dry mouth, taste disturbance, drowsiness, headache, dizziness, palpitations and malaise.<ref name="Bronica2" /> Less than 0.1% of patients experienced vomiting, thrombocytopenia, epistaxis, bleeding tendency, insomnia, tremor, numbness, hot flushes and edema.<ref name="Bronica2" /> All the adverse reactions reported were of mild to moderate severity, and resolved when the drug was discontinued.<ref name="Bronica2" />

==Pharmacology==
[[Thromboxane A2]] (TXA<sub>2</sub>) is generated in the lungs of people with asthma, and when it signals through the [[thromboxane receptor]] it causes [[bronchoconstriction]],  [[vasoconstriction]], [[mucous]] secretion, and [[airway hyper-responsiveness]]. Seratrodast inhibits the activity of the [[thromboxane receptor]], blocking the effects of TXA<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=Dogne2002rev>{{cite journal|last1=Dogné|first1=JM|last2=de Leval|first2=X|last3=Benoit|first3=P|last4=Rolin|first4=S|last5=Pirotte|first5=B|last6=Masereel|first6=B|title=Therapeutic potential of thromboxane inhibitors in asthma.|journal=Expert opinion on investigational drugs|date=February 2002|volume=11|issue=2|pages=275–81|doi=10.1517/13543784.11.2.275|pmid=11829716}}</ref>

==History==
Seratrodast was the first [[thromboxane receptor antagonist]] to reach the market as a treatment for asthma; it was approved in Japan in 1997.<ref name=Rolin2006rev>{{cite journal|last1=Rolin|first1=S|last2=Masereel|first2=B|last3=Dogné|first3=JM|title=Prostanoids as pharmacological targets in COPD and asthma.|journal=European journal of pharmacology|date=8 March 2006|volume=533|issue=1-3|pages=89–100|doi=10.1016/j.ejphar.2005.12.058|pmid=16458293}}</ref>

==Society and culture==
As of 2017 seratrodast was marketed as Bronica in Japan, Changnuo, Mai Xu Jia, Quan Kang Nuo in China and as Seradair in India.<ref name=brands/>

==Research==
Seratrodast was studied in [[allergic rhinitis|perennial allergic rhinitis]], [[chronic bronchitis]] and [[Emphysema|chronic pulmonary emphysema]] but efforts to bring the drug to market in those indications was abandoned around 2000.<ref name=Adis/>
