'''Oxybutynin''' (brand names '''Ditropan''', '''Lyrinel XL''', '''Lenditro''' <small>([[South Africa|ZA]])</small>, '''Driptane''' <small>([[Russia|RU]])</small>, '''Uripan''' (Middle East)<ref>{{cite web|title=Uripan Tablets|url=http://www.adwia.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=212&Itemid=274&lang=en|publisher=Adwia Pharmaceuticals|accessdate=22 November 2015}}</ref>) is an [[anticholinergic]] medication used to relieve urinary and bladder difficulties, including frequent urination and inability to control urination ([[Urinary incontinence#Urge incontinence|urge incontinence]]), by decreasing muscle spasms of the bladder.<ref>Chapple CR. "Muscarinic receptor antagonists in the treatment of overactive bladder". ''Urology'' (55)5, Supp. 1:33-46, 2000.</ref> It is also given to help with symptoms associated with kidney stones.

It [[Competitive antagonist|competitively]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonizes]] the [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1|M<sub>1</sub>]], [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2|M<sub>2</sub>]], and [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3|M<sub>3</sub>]] subtypes of the [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor]]. It also has direct [[muscle relaxant#Spasmolytics|spasmolytic]] effects on bladder smooth muscle as a [[Voltage-gated calcium channel|calcium antagonist]] and local anesthetic, but at concentrations far above those used clinically.

Oxybutynin is also a possible treatment of [[hyperhidrosis]] (hyperactive sweating).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Tupker RA, Harmsze AM, Deneer VH | title = Oxybutynin therapy for generalized hyperhidrosis. | journal = Arch Dermatol | volume = 142| issue = 8 | pages = 1065–6| year = 2006 | pmid = 16924061 | doi = 10.1001/archderm.142.8.1065 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mijnhout GS, Kloosterman H, Simsek S, Strack van Schijndel RJ, Netelenbos JC | title = Oxybutynin: dry days for patients with hyperhidrosis. | journal = Neth J Med  | volume = 64 | issue = 9 | pages = 326–8| year = 2006 | pmid = 17057269 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Schollhammer M, Misery L | title = Treatment of hyperhidrosis with oxybutynin. | journal = Arch Dermatol.  | volume = 143 | issue = 4 | pages = 544–5| year = 2007 | pmid = 17438194 | doi = 10.1001/archderm.143.4.544 }}</ref>

== Chemistry ==
Oxybutynin contains one [[Chirality (chemistry)|stereocenter]]. Commercial formulations are sold as the [[Racemic|racemate]]. The [[Enantiomer|(''R'')-enantiomer]] is a more potent anticholinergic than either the racemate or the (''S'')-enantiomer, which is essentially without anticholinergic activity at doses used in clinical practice.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kachur JF | year = 1988 | title = R and S enantiomers of oxybutynin: pharmacological effects in guinea pig bladder and intestine | url = | journal = Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 247 | issue = | pages = 867–72 |display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Noronha-Blob L, Kachur JF | year = 1991 | title = Enantiomers of oxybutynin: in vitro pharmacological characterization at M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2</sub> and M<sub>3</sub> muscarinic receptors and in vivo effects on urinary bladder contraction, mydriasis and salivary secretion in guinea pigs | url = | journal = Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 256 | issue = | pages = 562–7 }}</ref> However, (''R'')-oxybutynin administered alone offers little or no clinical benefit above and beyond the racemic mixture. The other actions (calcium antagonism, local anesthesia) of oxybutynin are not stereospecific. (''S'')-Oxybutynin has not been clinically tested for its spasmolytic effects, but may be clinically useful for the same indications as the racemate, without the unpleasant anticholinergic side effects.

==Clinical efficacy==
In two trials of patients with overactive bladder, transdermal oxybutynin 3.9&nbsp;mg/day decreased the number of incontinence episodes and increased average voided volume to a significantly greater extent than placebo. There was no difference in transdermal oxybutynin and extended-release oral tolterodine.<ref name="oxybut">Baldwin C, Keating GM.[http://adisonline.com/drugs/abstract/2009/69030/Transdermal_Oxybutynin.8.aspx]" ''Drugs'' 2009;69 (3):327-337. {{doi|10.2165/00003495-200969030-00008}}.</ref>

== Adverse effects ==
Common adverse effects that are associated with oxybutynin and other [[anticholinergics]] include: dry mouth, difficulty in [[urination]], constipation, blurred vision, drowsiness, and dizziness.<ref>Mehta D (Ed.) 2006. [[British National Formulary]] 51. Pharmaceutical Press. {{ISBN|0-85369-668-3}}</ref> Anticholinergics have also been known to induce [[delirium]].<ref>Andreasen NC and Black DW, "Introductory Textbook of Psychiatry." American Psychiatric Publishing Inc. 2006</ref>

These are dose-related and sometimes severe. In one population studied—after six months, more than half of the patients had stopped taking the medication because of side effects{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} and calcium defects. An intake of calcium of 800 to 1000&nbsp;mg is suggested.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Dry mouth may be particularly severe; one estimate is that over a quarter of patients who begin oxybutynin treatment may have to stop because of dry mouth.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}
Oxybutynin's tendency to reduce sweating can be dangerous. Reduced sweating increases the risk of heat exhaustion and heat stroke in apparently safe situations where normal sweating keep others safe and comfortable. <ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0011534/?report=details#warning</ref> Adverse effects of elevated body temperature are more likely for the elderly and for those with health issues, especially multiple sclerosis. <ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/23599395/?i=4&from=/20671034/related</ref>

''N''-Desethyloxybutynin is an active metabolite of oxybutynin that is thought responsible for much of the adverse effects associated with the use of oxybutynin.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Allen B. Reitz |author2=Suneel K. Gupta |author3=Yifang Huang |author4=Michael H. Parker |author5=Richard R.

The long-acting formulations also allow once-daily administration instead of the twice-daily dosage required with the immediate-release form. The transdermal patch, in addition to the benefits of the extended-release oral formulations, bypasses the [[First pass effect|first-pass hepatic effect]] that the oral formulations are subject to.<ref>Oki T, et al. "Advantages for Transdermal over Oral Oxybutynin to Treat Overactive Bladder: Muscarinic Receptor Binding, Plasma Drug Concentration, and Salivary Secretion". ''Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics'' Fast Forward 316:1137-1145, 2006.</ref>  In those with overflow incontinence because of diabetes or neurological diseases like multiple sclerosis or spinal cord trauma, oxybutynin can worsen overflow incontinence since the fundamental problem is that the bladder is not contracting.

A large study linked the development of [[Alzheimer's disease]] and other forms of dementia in those over 65 to the use of oxybutynin, due to its [[anticholinergic]] properties.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gray|first=Shelly L.|last2=Anderson|first2=Melissa L.|date=January 26, 2015|title=Cumulative Use of Strong Anticholinergics and Incident Dementia: A Prospective Cohort Study|url=http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2091745|journal=JAMA Intern.

== Clinical pharmacology ==
Oxybutynin chloride exerts direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. It exhibits one-fifth of the [[anticholinergic]] activity of [[atropine]] on the rabbit detrusor muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects).

Sources say the drug is absorbed within one hour and has an elimination half-life of 2 to 5 hours.<ref>[http://www.drugs.com/pro/oxybutynin.html] "Oxybutynin" Retrieved on 30 August 2012.</ref><ref name="pubmed3234461">{{cite journal | pmid = 3234461 | volume=35 | title=The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in man | journal=Eur J Clin Pharmacol | pages=515–20 | vauthors=Douchamps J, Derenne F, Stockis A, Gangji D, Juvent M, Herchuelz A | doi=10.1007/bf00558247}}</ref><ref>[http://americareoncall.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/DITROPAN.4992339.pdf] "Oxybutynin" Retrieved on 30 August 2012.</ref> There is a wide variation among individuals in the drug's concentration in blood. This, and its low concentration in urine, suggest that it is eliminated through the liver.<ref name="pubmed3234461" />

== Contraindications ==
Oxybutynin chloride is contraindicated in patients with untreated narrow angle [[glaucoma]], and in patients with untreated narrow anterior chamber angles—since [[Anticholinergic|anticholinergic drugs]] may aggravate these conditions. It is also contraindicated in partial or complete obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract, hiatal hernia, [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]], paralytic ileus, intestinal atony of the elderly or debilitated patient, [[megacolon]], [[toxic megacolon]] complicating [[ulcerative colitis]], severe colitis, and [[myasthenia gravis]]. It is contraindicated in patients with [[obstructive uropathy]] and in patients with unstable cardiovascular status in acute hemorrhage. Oxybutynin chloride is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the product.

== Formulations==
It is available orally in generic formulation or as the brand-names Ditropan, Lyrinel XL, or Ditrospam, as a transdermal patch under the brand name Oxytrol, and as a topical gel under the brand name Gelnique.
