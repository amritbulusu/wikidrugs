'''Tedizolid''' (formerly '''torezolid''', trade name '''Sivextro'''),<ref name=Nov2011>{{cite news |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2011/oct/31/trius-grows-lead-antibiotic-moves-forward/ |title=Trius grows as lead antibiotic moves forward |date=31 Oct 2011 }}</ref> is an [[oxazolidinone]]-class antibiotic. '''Tedizolid phosphate''' is a [[phosphate ester]] prodrug of the active compound tedizolid. It was developed by [[Cubist Pharmaceuticals]], following acquisition of [[Trius Therapeutics]] (originator: Dong-A Pharmaceuticals), and is marketed for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (also known as [[complicated skin and skin-structure infections]] (cSSSIs)).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://investors.cubist.com/Mobile/file.aspx?IID=4093793&FID=18531897 |title=Cubist Pharmaceuticals to Acquire Trius Therapeutics |date=July 2013 }}</ref>

Tedizolid has been approved by the U.S [[Food and Drug Administration]] on June 20, 2014, for the treatment of acute bacterial [[Skin and skin structure infection]]s (ABSSSI) caused by certain susceptible bacteria, including ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' (including methicillin-resistant strains, [[MRSA]], and methicillin-susceptible strains), various ''[[Streptococcus]]'' species (''S. pyogenes'', ''S. agalactiae'', and ''S. anginosus'' group including ''S. anginosus'', ''S. intermedius'', and ''S. constellatus''), and ''[[Enterococcus faecalis]]''.<ref name ="FDA Approval">{{cite news |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm402174.htm |title=FDA approves Sivextro to treat skin infections |date=June 2014 }}</ref><ref name= "Prescribing Info">[http://sivextro.com/pdf/sivextro-prescribing-info.pdf "Sivextro Prescribing info"]. Lexington, MA: Cubist.Updated March 2015.</ref> Tedizolid is a second-generation [[oxazolidinone]] derivative that is 4-to-16-fold more potent against staphylococci and enterococci compared to [[linezolid]].<ref>[http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1517/13543784.2012.660250 "Tedizolid (TR-701): a new oxazolidinone with enhanced potency"]. Accessed 2015-03-16.</ref> The recommended dosage for treatment is 200&nbsp;mg once daily for a total duration of six days, either orally (with or without food) or through an intravenous injection (if patient is older than 18 years old).<ref name="Prescribing Info"/>

==Mechanism of action==
Tedizolid phosphate (TR-701) is a [[prodrug]] activated by plasma or intestinal [[phosphatases]] to tedizolid (TR-700) following administration of the drug either orally or intravenously.<ref name="Prescribing Info"/><ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 2715649 | pmid=19528279 | doi=10.1128/AAC.00228-09 | volume=53 | title=In vitro activity of TR-700, the active ingredient of the antibacterial prodrug TR-701, a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agent | date=August 2009 | journal=Antimicrob.

==Clinical trials==
Tedizolid proved its noninferiority to linezolid in two phase-III trials, known as the ESTABLISH trials.<ref>[http://aac.asm.org/content/59/2/864.long "Analysis of the Phase 3 ESTABLISH Trials of Tedizolid versus Linezolid in Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections"]. Accessed March 16, 2015</ref>

Tedizolid is the second treatment approved by the FDA under the new federal law [[Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now]] (known as the GAIN Act).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm320643.htm |title=New FDA task force will support innovation in antibacterial drug development |date=September 2012 }}</ref><ref name ="GAIN">{{cite news |url=http://blogs.fda.gov/fdavoice/index.php/tag/gain-act/ |title=Three encouraging steps towards new antibiotics |date=September 2014 }}</ref> New antibiotics manufactured under this new act will be designed as a [[Qualified Infectious Disease Product]] (QIDP), allowing an expedited review by the FDA and an additional five years of market exclusivity.<ref name="GAIN"/>

==Adverse effects==
The most common adverse effects found in the clinical trials were nausea, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, and dizziness.<ref name="Prescribing Info"/> Tedizolid has also been found to have hematologic (blood) effects, as shown in [[phase I clinical trial|Phase-I]] studies in which subjects exposed to doses longer than 6 days showed a possible dose and duration effect on hematologic parameters.<ref name="Prescribing Info"/>  Its safety in patients with decreased levels of white blood cells has not been established.<ref name="FDA Approval"/>  Patients on tedizolid are also at low risk of peripheral and [[optic neuropathy]], similar to other members of the oxazolidinone class.<ref name="Prescribing Info"/>
