'''Benzethonium chloride''', also known as '''hyamine''' is a synthetic [[quaternary ammonium salt]]. This compound is an odorless white solid, soluble in water.  It has [[surfactant]], [[antiseptic]], and anti-infective properties, and it is used as a topical [[antimicrobial agent]] in [[first aid]] antiseptics. It is also found in [[cosmetics]] and [[toiletries]] such as [[mouthwashes]], anti-itch ointments, and antibacterial moist towelettes. Benzethonium chloride is also used in the food industry as a hard surface [[disinfectant]].<ref>{{HPD|2179}}</ref>

==Uses==

===Antimicrobial===
Benzethonium chloride exhibits a broad spectrum of microbiocidal activity against bacteria, fungi, mold and viruses.  Independent testing shows that benzethonium chloride is highly effective against such pathogens as [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']],  ''[[Salmonella]]'', ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|Clostridium difficile]]'', [[hepatitis B virus]], [[hepatitis C virus]], [[herpes simplex virus]] (HSV), [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV), [[respiratory syncytial virus]] (RSV), and [[norovirus]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) specifies that the safe and effective concentrations for benzethonium chloride are 0.1-0.2% in first aid products.<ref>[http://www.havlon.com/documents/Handbook_of_topical_microbials.pdf Tentative final monograph (21CFR 333)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522070818/http://www.havlon.com/documents/Handbook_of_topical_microbials.pdf |date=May 22, 2014 }}</ref>  Aqueous solutions of benzethonium chloride are not absorbed through the skin. It is not approved in the US and Europe for use as a [[food additive]]. Being a [[Quaternary ammonium cation|quaternary ammonium salt]], it is more toxic than negatively charged surfactants.<ref>[http://datasheets.scbt.com/sc-239299.pdf Data Sheets]</ref> However, in a two-year study on rats, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity.<ref>{{Cite journal

It is available under trade names '''Salanine''', '''BZT''', '''Diapp''', '''Quatrachlor''', '''Polymine D''', '''Phemithyn''', '''Antiseptol''', '''Disilyn''', '''Phermerol''', and others.<ref>[http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9923044 Sciencelab.com, Benzethonium chloride MSDS]</ref>  It is also found in several [[grapefruit seed extract]] preparations<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jf010222w| title = Identification of Benzethonium Chloride in Commercial Grapefruit Seed Extracts| journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry| volume = 49| issue = 7| pages = 3316–20| year = 2001| last1 = Takeoka | first1 = G. | last2 = Dao | first2 = L. | last3 = Wong | first3 = R.

===Other uses===
In addition to its highly effective antimicrobial activity, benzethonium chloride contains a positively charged nitrogen atom covalently bonded to four carbon atoms.  This positive charge attracts it to the skin and hair.  This contributes to a soft, powdery afterfeel on the skin and hair, as well as long-lasting persistent activity against micro-organisms. Also, this positively charged hydrophilic part of the molecule makes it a [[Detergent#Cationic detergents|cationic detergent]].<ref>[http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+567 TOXNET]</ref>

Benzethonium chloride is also used to [[titration|titrate]] the quantity of [[sodium dodecyl sulfate]] in a mixture of sodium dodecyl sulfate, [[sodium chloride]] and [[sodium sulfate]], using [[dimidium bromide]]-sulphan blue as an indicator.<ref name="euro pharmacopoeia">{{cite book | url=http://lib.njutcm.edu.cn/yaodian/ep/EP501E/16_monographs/19_monographs_q-z/sodium_laurilsulfate/0098e.pdf | title=European Pharmacopoeia 5.0 Monographs | publisher=European Pharmacopoeia Commission | pages=2440}}</ref>

It precipitates as turbidity with anionic polymers in aqueous solution, allowing it to be used to estimate the amount of such polymers present in a sample. This test is used in commercial and industrial water treatment, where polyacrylates, polymaleates, and sulfonated polymers are commonly employed as dispersants.

==Regulation==
Some data has suggested that long-term exposure to antibacterial ingredients could contribute to bacterial resistance or hormonal effects. Furthermore, there is little evidence that the use of such ingredients in consumer soaps is actually more effective than plain soap and water. In September 2016, the Food and Drug Administration issued a ban on nineteen consumer antiseptic wash ingredients. A ruling on benzethonium chloride, along with two other similar ingredients, was deferred for a year to allow for more data collection.<ref>{{cite web|title=FDA issues final rule on safety and effectiveness of antibacterial soaps|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm517478.htm|website=Food & Drug Administration|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=February 7, 2017}}</ref>
