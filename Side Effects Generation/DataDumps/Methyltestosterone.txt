==Medical uses==
Methyltestosterone is or has been used in the treatment of [[delayed puberty]], [[hypogonadism]], [[cryptorchidism]], and [[erectile dysfunction]] in males, and in low doses to treat [[menopause|menopausal symptom]]s (specifically for [[osteoporosis]], [[hot flash]]es, and to increase [[libido]] and [[energy (psychological)|energy]]), [[postpartum]] [[breast pain]] and [[breast engorgement|engorgement]], and [[breast cancer]] in women.<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /><ref name="Ebadi2007">{{cite book|author=Manuchair Ebadi|title=Desk Reference of Clinical Pharmacology, Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ihxyHbnj3qYC&pg=PA434|date=31 October 2007|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-4744-8|pages=434–}}</ref><ref name="YagielaDowd2010">{{cite book |author1= John A.

==Non-medical uses==
Methyltestosterone is used for [[performance-enhancing drug|physique- or performance-enhancing purpose]]s by [[competition|competitive]] [[athlete]]s, [[bodybuilder]]s, and [[powerlifter]]s, although it is not commonly used relative to other AAS for such purposes.<ref name="Llewellyn2009" />

==Dosage==
The dosages of methyltestosterone used are 10 to 50&nbsp;mg/day in men for common medical uses and physique- and performance-enhancing purposes and 2.5&nbsp;mg/day in women for menopausal symptoms.<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /> Higher dosages of as much as 200&nbsp;mg/day have been used to treat women with inoperable breast cancer that has failed to respond to other therapies.<ref name="Llewellyn2009" />

==Contraindications==
Methyltestosterone should be used with caution in women and children, as it can cause irreversible [[virilization]].<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /> Due to its estrogenicity, methyltestosterone can also accelerate [[epiphyseal closure]] and thereby produce [[short stature]] in children and adolescents.<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /> It can worsen symptoms in men with [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]].<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /> Methyltestosterone should not be used in men with [[prostate cancer]], as androgens can accelerate [[tumor progression]].<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /> The drug should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing [[hepatotoxicity]], due to its own potential for hepatotoxicity.<ref name="Llewellyn2009" />

==Side effects==
{{See also|Anabolic steroid#Adverse effects}}

[[Adverse effect]]s of methyltestosterone include [[androgen]]ic side effects like [[oily skin]], [[acne]], [[seborrhea]], increased [[facial hair|facial]]/[[body hair]] [[hair growth|growth]], [[pattern hair loss|scalp hair loss]], increased [[aggressiveness]] and [[sex drive]], and [[spontaneous erection]]s, as well as [[estrogen]]ic side effects like [[gynecomastia]], [[water retention (medicine)|fluid retention]], and [[edema]].<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /><ref name="Kicman2008" /> In women, methyltestosterone can cause partially irreversible [[virilization]], for instance [[voice deepening]], [[hirsutism]], [[clitoromegaly]], [[breast atrophy]], and [[muscle hypertrophy]], as well as [[menstrual irregularity|menstrual disturbance]]s and reversible [[infertility]].<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /><ref name="Kicman2008" /> In men, the drug may also cause [[hypogonadism]], [[testicular atrophy]], and reversible infertility at sufficiently high dosages.<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /><ref name="Kicman2008" />

Methyltestosterone can sometimes cause [[hepatotoxicity]], for instance [[elevated liver enzymes]], [[cholestatic jaundice]], [[peliosis hepatis]], [[hepatoma]]s, and [[hepatocellular carcinoma]], with extended use.<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /><ref name="Kicman2008" /><ref name="Aronson2009">{{cite book|author=Jeffrey K.

==Interactions==
[[Aromatase inhibitor]]s can be used to reduce or prevent the [[estrogen]]ic effects of methyltestosterone and [[5α-reductase inhibitor]]s can be used to prevent its potentiation in so-called "androgenic" tissues and thereby improve its ratio of [[anabolic]] to [[androgen]]ic activity and reduce its rate of androgenic [[side effect]]s.<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /> [[Antiandrogen]]s like [[bicalutamide]] and [[cyproterone acetate]] can block both the anabolic and androgenic effects of AAS like methyltestosterone.

==Pharmacology==
As an AAS, methyltestosterone is an [[agonist]] of the [[androgen receptor]] (AR), similarly to [[androgen]]s like [[testosterone]] and [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT).<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /><ref name="Kicman2008">{{cite journal |last1=Kicman |first1=A T |title=Pharmacology of anabolic steroids |journal=British Journal of Pharmacology |volume=154 |issue=3 |year=2008 |pages=502–521 |doi=10.1038/bjp.2008.165|pmid=18500378 |pmc=2439524}}</ref> It is a [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] for [[5α-reductase]] like testosterone, and so is potentiated analogously in so-called "androgenic" tissues like the [[skin]], [[hair follicle]]s, and [[prostate gland]] via [[biotransformation|transformation]] into the more [[potency (pharmacology)|potent]] AR agonist [[mestanolone]] (17α-methyl-DHT).<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /><ref name="Kicman2008" /> As such, methyltestosterone has a relatively low ratio of [[anabolic]] to [[androgen]]ic activity, with a similar ratio to that of testosterone (close to 1:1), and this makes it among the most androgenic AAS.<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /><ref name="Kicman2008" /> Due to efficient [[aromatization]] into the potent and [[metabolic stability|metabolically resistant]] [[estrogen]] [[methylestradiol]] (17α-methylestradiol), methyltestosterone has relatively high [[estrogen]]icity and hence potential for [[estrogen]]ic [[side effect]]s such as [[gynecomastia]] and [[water retention (medicine)|fluid retention]].<ref name="ThiemeHemmersbach2009" /><ref name="Genazzani2006">{{cite book|author=Andrea R. Genazzani|title=Postmenopausal Osteoporosis: Hormones & Other Therapies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P7tzqD9J7TgC&pg=PA243|date=17 January 2006|publisher=Taylor & Francis US|isbn=978-1-84214-311-7|pages=243–}}</ref> The drug possesses negligible [[progestogen]]ic activity.<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /><ref name="Kicman2008" />

Due to its combined disadvantages of a relatively poor ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity, unusually high estrogenicity, and the potential for [[hepatotoxicity]], methyltestosterone has not been used as commonly as many other AAS either in medicine or for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes.<ref name="Llewellyn2009" />

==Pharmacokinetics==
Because of its C17α methyl group, methyltestosterone has dramatically improved [[oral administration|oral]] [[bioavailability]] and [[metabolic stability]] relative to testosterone, and for this reason, unlike testosterone, is orally active.<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /><ref name="Kicman2008" /> The oral bioavailability of methyltestosterone is about 70%, and its [[terminal half-life]] is approximately 3&nbsp;hours (range 2.5–3.5&nbsp;hours),<ref name="LemkeWilliams2012">{{cite book|author1=Thomas L.
