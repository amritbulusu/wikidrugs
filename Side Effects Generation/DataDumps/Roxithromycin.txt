'''Roxithromycin''' is a semi-synthetic [[macrolide]] [[antibiotic]]. It is used to treat respiratory tract, urinary and soft tissue infections. Roxithromycin is derived from [[erythromycin]], containing the same 14-membered lactone ring. However, an N-oxime [[side chain]] is attached to the lactone ring.  It is also currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of male-pattern hair loss.<ref>{{cite web| title = The Effect of 0.5% Roxithromycin Lotion for Androgenetic Alopecia - ClinicalTrials.gov | url = http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00197379?order=8| accessdate = 2007-09-22}}</ref>

Roxithromycin is available under several brandnames. Roxithromycin is not available in the United States. Roxithromycin is available in Australia, Israel and New Zealand. Roxithromycin has also been tested to possess antimalarial activity.

== History ==
German pharmaceutical company [[Roussel Uclaf]] brought out roxithromycin in 1987.

== Available forms ==
Roxithromycin is commonly available as tablets or oral suspension.

== Mechanism of action ==
Roxithromycin prevents [[bacterium|bacteria]] from growing, by interfering with their [[protein synthesis]]. Roxithromycin binds to the subunit 50S of the bacterial [[ribosome]], and thus inhibits the synthesis of [[peptide]]s. Roxithromycin has similar antimicrobial spectrum as erythromycin, but is more effective against certain gram-negative bacteria, particularly ''[[Legionella pneumophila]]''.

== Pharmacokinetics ==
When taken before a meal, roxithromycin is very rapidly absorbed, and diffused into most tissues and [[phagocyte]]s. Due to the high concentration in [[phagocytes]], roxithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of roxithromycin are released.

== Metabolism ==
Only a small portion of roxithromycin is metabolised. Most of roxithromycin is secreted unchanged into the bile and some in expired air. Under 10% is excreted into the urine. Roxithromycin's half-life is 12 hours.

== Side effects ==
Most common side effects are gastrointestinal; diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain and vomiting.  Less common side effects include central or peripheral nervous system events such as headaches, dizziness, vertigo, and also the rarely seen rashes, abnormal liver function values and alteration in senses of smell and taste.

== Drug interactions ==
Roxithromycin has fewer interactions than [[erythromycin]] as it has a lower affinity for [[cytochrome P450]].

Roxithromycin does not interact with [[Hormonal contraception|hormonal contraceptives]], [[prednisolone]], [[carbamazepine]], [[ranitidine]] or [[antacids]].

When roxithromycin is administered with [[theophylline]], some studies have shown an increase in the [[Blood plasma|plasma]] concentration of [[theophylline]]. A change in dosage is usually not required but patients with high levels of [[theophylline]] at the start of the [[Pharmacotherapy|treatment]] should have their plasma levels monitored.

Roxithromycin appears to interact with [[warfarin]]. This is shown by an increase in prothrombin time and/or international normalised ratio (INR) in patients taking roxithromycin and [[warfarin]] concurrently. As a consequence, severe bleeding episodes have occurred.
