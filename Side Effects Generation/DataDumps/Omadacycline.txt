Paratek Pharmaceuticals is developing omadacycline as a treatment for serious community-acquired infections.

==In vitro Studies==
''[[In vitro]]'' studies have shown that omadacycline has activity against a broad range of [[Gram-positive]] and select [[Gram-negative]] pathogens.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tanaka|first1=S. Ken|title=In Vitro and In Vivo Assessment of Cardiovascular Effects with Omadacycline|journal=Antimicrob.

Omadacycline has also shown activity against common Gram-negative aerobes, some anaerobes and atypical bacteria such as ''[[Legionella]]'' and ''[[Chlamydia]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Villano|first1=Stephen|title=Omadacycline: development of a novel aminomethylcycline antibiotic for treating drug-resistant bacterial infections|journal=Future Microbiology|date=19 August 2016|doi=10.2217/fmb-2016-0100|url=http://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/pdf/10.2217/fmb-2016-0100|accessdate=24 August 2016|volume=11|pages=1421–1434}}</ref>   This activity translated to potent efficacy for omadacycline in an [[In vivo]] systemic infection model in mice.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1128/AAC.01242-13| pmid = 24295985| title = In Vitro and in Vivo Antibacterial Activities of Omadacycline, a Novel Aminomethylcycline| journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy| volume = 58| issue = 2| pages = 1127–1135| year = 2013| last1 = MacOne| first1 = A.

Additional ''in vitro'' and ''[[in vivo]]'' studies of omadacycline metabolism, dispositon and drug-drug interactions show that omadacycline is metabolically stable (no significant biotransformations) and does not inhibit or interact with metabolizing enzymes or transporters.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Flarakos|first1=Jimmy|title=Clinical disposition, metabolism and in vitro drug–drug interaction properties of omadacycline|journal=Xenobiotica|pages=1–15|date=8 Aug 2016|doi=10.1080/00498254.2016.1213465|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00498254.2016.1213465}}</ref>

==Mechanism of Action==
The mechanism of action for omadacycline has been shown to be primarily through inhibition of bacterial [[protein synthesis]].  Omadacycline has demonstrated activity against bacterial strains expressing the two main forms of tetracycline resistance ([[Efflux (microbiology)|efflux]] and [[Ribosomal protein|ribosomal]] protection).<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1128/AAC.01066-13| pmid = 24041885| title = Mechanism of Action of the Novel Aminomethylcycline Antibiotic Omadacycline| journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy| volume = 58| issue = 3| pages = 1279–1283| year = 2013| last1 = Draper| first1 = M.

==Clinical Trials==
A Phase 2 study was conducted comparing the safety and efficacy of omadacycline to [[linezolid]] for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI).  Patients were randomized to receive either omadacycline 100&nbsp;mg intravenously once daily with an option to transition to 200&nbsp;mg orally once daily or linezolid 600&nbsp;mg intravenously twice daily with an option to transition to 600&nbsp;mg orally twice daily at 11 US sites.  The phase 2 trial results support conclusions that omadacycline is well tolerated in cSSSI patients and has the potential to be an effective treatment for serious skin infections.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1128/AAC.00948-12| pmid = 22908151| title = A Randomized, Evaluator-Blind, Phase 2 Study Comparing the Safety and Efficacy of Omadacycline to Those of Linezolid for Treatment of Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections| journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy| volume = 56| issue = 11| pages = 5650–5654| year = 2012| last1 = Noel| first1 = G.

In June 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration ([[FDA]]) designated omadacycline as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product ([[QIDP]]) for both intravenous and oral formulations in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections ([[ABSSSI]]) and [[community-acquired bacterial pneumonia]] (CABP).<ref>http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paratek-pharmaceuticals-announces-fda-grant-of-qualified-infectious-disease-product-qidp-designation-for-its-lead-product-candidate-omadacycline-185554432.html</ref>

A 650 patient Phase 3 registration study known as OASIS (Omadacycline in Acute Skin and Skin Structure Infections Study), comparing omadacycline to linezolid for the treatment of Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections (ABSSSI) began in June 2015.<ref>http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/bioflash/2016/04/paratek-presents-new-trial-data-for-antibiotic-as.html</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Omadacycline Versus Linezolid for the Treatment of ABSSSI (EudraCT #2013-003644-23) - Full Text View - ClinicalTrials.gov|url = https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02378480?term=omadacycline&rank=2|website = clinicaltrials.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-13}}</ref> Omadacycline met the primary efficacy endpoint of early clinical response with statistical non-inferiority (10% margin) compared to linezolid.  Omadacycline was generally safe and well tolerated.  The most common treatment emergent adverse event was gastrointestinal events (18.0% for omadacycline vs. 15.8% for linezolid).<ref>{{cite web|title=Paratek Announces that Omadacycline Met All Primary and Secondary Efficacy Outcomes Designated by FDA and EMA in a Phase 3 Study in Acute Bacterial Skin Infections; Omadacycline was Generally Safe and Well-Tolerated|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paratek-announces-omadacycline-met-primary-200500457.html;_ylt=A0LEV2BtFXlXUB8A5QVXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTEyaGZiMzI1BGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwM0BHZ0aWQDQjIzNzBfMQRzZWMDc3I-|website=finance.yahoo.com|accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref>

A 750 global pivotal patient Phase 3 study known as OPTIC (Omadacyline Pneumonia Treatment In the Community) comparing omadacycline to [[moxifloxacin]] for the treatment of Community Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia (CABP) began in November 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Omadacycline vs Moxifloxacin for the Treatment of CABP (EudraCT #2013-004071-13) - Full Text View - ClinicalTrials.gov|url = https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02531438?term=omadacycline&rank=1|website = clinicaltrials.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-13}}</ref>  Omadacycline was shown to be statistically non-inferior to moxifloxacin at the early clinical response (ECR) 72-120 hours after therapy was initiated.<ref>{{cite web|title=Paratek Announces Positive Phase 3 Study of Omadacycline in Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia|url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/04/03/953801/0/en/Paratek-Announces-Positive-Phase-3-Study-of-Omadacycline-in-Community-Acquired-Bacterial-Pneumonia.html|website=www.globenewswire.com|accessdate=16 May 2017}}</ref>

In May 2016, a phase 1b study of omadacycline in [[Urinary Tract Infection]] was initiated.<ref>{{cite web|title=Paratek Initiates Phase 1b Study of Omadacycline in Urinary Tract Infection|url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/05/02/835655/0/en/Paratek-Initiates-Phase-1b-Study-of-Omadacycline-in-Urinary-Tract-Infection.html|website=globenewswire.com|accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref>

In August 2016, a second, pivotal phase 3 study of omadacycline in patients with ABSSSI was initiated.  The study assessed the efficacy and safety of once-daily, oral-only omadacycline compared to twice-daily, oral-only linezolid in patients with ABSSSI.<ref>{{cite web|title=Paratek Initiates Phase 3 Study of Oral-only Omadacycline in ABSSSI|url=http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/08/15/864138/0/en/Paratek-Initiates-Phase-3-Study-of-Oral-only-Omadacycline-in-ABSSSI.html|website=globenewswire.com|accessdate=15 August 2016}}</ref>  This study, named OASIS-2, reported in July 2017 positive top-line results.  The study met all of its primary and secondary endpoints required for submission to FDA and EMA.  This is the third positive Phase 3 registration study for omadacycline.<ref>{{cite web|title=Paratek Announces Phase 3 Study of Oral-Only Dosing of Omadacycline Met All Primary and Secondary FDA and EMA Efficacy Endpoints in Acute Bacterial Skin Infections|url=http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/07/17/1047604/0/en/Paratek-Announces-Phase-3-Study-of-Oral-Only-Dosing-of-Omadacycline-Met-All-Primary-and-Secondary-FDA-and-EMA-Efficacy-Endpoints-in-Acute-Bacterial-Skin-Infections.html|website=www.globenewswire.com|accessdate=19 July 2017}}</ref>
