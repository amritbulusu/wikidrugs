'''Nalidixic acid''' (tradenames '''Nevigramon''', '''Neggram''', '''Wintomylon''' and '''WIN 18,320''') is the first of the synthetic [[quinolone antibiotic]]s.

In a technical sense, it is a naphthyridone, not a quinolone: its ring structure is a 1,8-[[naphthyridine]] nucleus that contains two nitrogen atoms, unlike quinoline, which has a single nitrogen atom.<ref name=jac2003>{{cite journal | vauthors = Emmerson AM, Jones AM | title = The quinolones: decades of development and use | journal = The Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy | volume = 51 Suppl 1 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = 13–20 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12702699 | doi = 10.1093/jac/dkg208 | url = http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/51/suppl_1/13.full.pdf | format = pdf }}</ref>

Synthetic quinolone antibiotics were discovered by George Lesher and coworkers as a byproduct of [[chloroquine]] manufacture in the 1960s.<ref name=jac2003 /> Used clinically from 1967.<ref name=jac2003 />

Nalidixic acid is effective primarily against [[gram-negative bacteria]], with minor anti-[[gram-positive]] activity. In lower concentrations, it acts in a [[bacteriostatic]] manner; that is, it inhibits growth and reproduction. In higher concentrations, it is bactericidal, meaning that it kills bacteria instead of merely inhibiting their growth.

It has historically been used for treating [[urinary tract infections]], caused, for example, by ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Proteus (bacterium)|Proteus]]'', ''[[Shigella]]'', ''[[Enterobacter]]'', and ''[[Klebsiella]]''. It is no longer clinically used for this indication in the USA as less toxic and more effective agents are available.

It is also a tool in studies as a regulation of bacterial division. It selectively and reversibly blocks DNA replication in susceptible bacteria. Nalidixic acid and related antibiotics inhibit a subunit of [[DNA gyrase]] and [[topoisomerase IV]] and induce formation of cleavage complexes.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pommier | first1 = Y. | last2 = Leo | first2 = E. | last3 = Zhang | first3 = H. | last4 = Marchand | first4 = C. | year = 2010 | title = DNA topoisomerases and their poisoning by anticancer and antibacterial drugs | url = | journal = Chem.

== Adverse effects ==

Hives, rash, intense itching, or fainting soon after a dose may be a sign of [[anaphylaxis]]. Common adverse effects include rash, itchy skin, blurred or double vision, halos around lights, changes in color vision, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
