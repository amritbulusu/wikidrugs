'''Buspirone''', sold under the brand name '''Buspar''', is an [[anxiolytic]] [[drug]] that is primarily used to treat [[generalized anxiety disorder]] (GAD).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nami.org/Template.cfm?Section=Policymakers_Toolkit&Template=/ContentManagement/HTMLDisplay.cfm&ContentID=18971 | title=Commonly Prescribed Psychotropic Medications | publisher=NAMI | accessdate=25 June 2014}}</ref> It is also commonly used to [[augmentation (pharmacology)|augment]] [[antidepressant]]s in the treatment of [[major depressive disorder]].<ref name="pmid26535760" /> Unlike most anxiolytics, the [[pharmacology]] of buspirone is not related to that of [[benzodiazepine]]s, [[barbiturate]]s, or [[carbamate]]s (it is not a [[GABA receptor agonist]]), and so buspirone does not carry the risk of [[physical dependence]] and [[withdrawal symptom]]s for which those drug classes are known. Buspirone is not considered to be a drug-of-abuse, is safer in overdose than traditional [[anxiolytics]], and is significantly less impairing at therapeutic doses.

===Depression===
Although not approved for this indication, studies such as [[STAR*D]] have shown buspirone to be an effective [[augmentation (pharmacology)|augmentation]] agent alongside treatment with [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs) for [[clinical depression]] and is also used to counter the [[sexual dysfunction]] ([[anorgasmia]] and [[erectile dysfunction]]) associated with SSRIs.<ref>{{cite web|title=The STAR*D Trial: First Results|url=http://pro.psychcentral.com/the-stard-trial-first-results/002745.html#|website=Psych Central|publisher=The Carlat Psychiaty Report|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=National Institute Of Health |url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/trials/practical/stard/allmedicationlevels.shtml |title=Questions and Answers about the NIMH Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) Study — All Medication Levels |deadurl=no |accessdate=12 August 2012}}</ref><ref name="pmid16554526">{{cite journal | vauthors = Trivedi MH, Fava M, Wisniewski SR, Thase ME, Quitkin F, Warden D, Ritz L, Nierenberg AA, Lebowitz BD, Biggs MM, Luther JF, Shores-Wilson K, Rush AJ | title = Medication augmentation after the failure of SSRIs for depression | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 354 | issue = 12 | pages = 1243–52 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16554526 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa052964 }}</ref><ref name="pmid11465522">{{cite journal | vauthors = Appelberg BG, Syvälahti EK, Koskinen TE, Mehtonen OP, Muhonen TT, Naukkarinen HH | title = Patients with severe depression may benefit from buspirone augmentation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: results from a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, placebo wash-in study | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 62 | issue = 6 | pages = 448–52 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11465522 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.v62n0608 }}</ref> The drug has also been found to be effective in the treatment of depression as a standalone drug.<ref name="pmid26535760" />

====Miscellaneous====
Buspirone may be useful in the management of [[irritability]], [[psychomotor agitation|agitation]], and [[aggression]] in older patients with [[dementia]] and in pediatrics, although further research is necessary to more clearly establish its effectiveness.<ref name="pmid26535760" />

==Side effects==
{{Main|List of side effects of buspirone}}

Known [[side effect]]s associated with buspirone include [[dizziness]], [[headache]]s, [[nausea]], [[anxiety|nervousness]], and [[paresthesia]].<ref name="pmid22608068" /> Unlike benzodiazepines, buspirone is relatively [[tolerability|well-tolerated]], and is not associated with [[sedation]], [[cognitive impairment|cognitive]] and [[psychomotor retardation|psychomotor impairment]], [[muscle relaxation]], [[physical dependence]], or [[anticonvulsant]] effects.<ref name="pmid22608068" /> In addition, buspirone does not produce [[euphoria]],<ref name="SadockSadock2014" /> and is not a [[drug of abuse]].<ref name = TGA/>

==Overdose==
Buspirone appears to be relatively benign in cases of single-drug [[overdose]], although no definitive data on this subject appear to be available.<ref name="FultonBrogden1997">{{cite journal|last1=Fulton|first1=Bret|last2=Brogden|first2=Rex N.|title=Buspirone|journal=CNS Drugs|volume=7|issue=1|year=1997|pages=68–88|issn=1172-7047|doi=10.2165/00023210-199707010-00007}}</ref> In one [[clinical trial]], buspirone was administered to healthy male volunteers at a dosage of 375&nbsp;mg/day, and produced side effects including [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[dizziness]], [[drowsiness]], [[miosis]], and [[gastric distress]].<ref name=DM/><ref name=TGA/><ref name=EMC/> In early clinical trials, buspirone was given at dosages even as high as 2,400&nbsp;mg/day, with [[akathisia]], [[tremor]], and [[muscle rigidity]] observed.<ref name="Dart2004">{{cite book|author=Richard C.

==Interactions==
Buspirone has been shown ''in vitro'' to be [[metabolism|metabolized]] by the [[enzyme]] [[CYP3A4]].<ref name="pmid15640381" /> This finding is consistent with the ''in vivo'' interactions observed between buspirone and these inhibitors or inducers of [[cytochrome P450]] 3A4 (CYP3A4), among others:<ref name=mono/>

* [[Rifampicin]]: Decreased plasma levels of buspirone

==Chemistry==
Buspirone is a member of the [[azapirone]] [[chemical class]], and consists of [[azaspirodecanedione]] and [[pyrimidinylpiperazine]] components linked together by a [[butyl group|butyl]] [[side chain|chain]].

===Analogues===
[[Structural analogue]]s of buspirone include other azapirones like [[gepirone]], [[ipsapirone]], [[perospirone]], and [[tandospirone]].<ref name="pmid1679210">{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor DP, Moon SL | title = Buspirone and related compounds as alternative anxiolytics | journal = Neuropeptides | volume = 19 Suppl | issue = | pages = 15–9 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1679210 | doi = | url = }}</ref>

Alkylation of 1-(2-pyrimidyl)piperazine ('''1''') with 3-chloro-1-cyanopropane ('''2''', 4-chlorobutyronitrile) gives '''3''', which is reduced either by [[hydrogenation]] over [[Raney nickel]] catalyst, or with [[Lithium aluminum hydride|LAH]]. The resulting 1° amine ('''4''') from the previous step is then reacted with 3,3-tetramethyleneglutaric anhydride ('''5''', 8-Oxaspiro[4.5]decane-7,9-dione) in order to yield buspirone ('''6''').
