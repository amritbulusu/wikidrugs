'''Tapentadol''' (brand names: '''Nucynta''', '''Palexia''' and '''Tapal''') is a centrally acting [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] of the benzenoid class with a dual mode of action as an [[agonist]] of the [[Mu opioid receptor|μ-opioid receptor]] and as a [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] (NRI).<ref name=Fidman2010rev/>  Analgesia occurs within 32 minutes of oral administration, and lasts for 4–6 hours.<ref name = Saudi>{{cite journal|last=Singh|first=DR|author2=Nag, K |author3=Shetti, AN |author4= Krishnaveni, N |title=Tapentadol hydrochloride: A novel analgesic.|journal=Saudi Journal of Anaesthesia|date=July 2013|volume=7|issue=3|pages=322–326|doi=10.4103/1658-354X.115319|pmid=24015138|pmc=3757808}}</ref>

It is similar to [[tramadol]] in its dual mechanism of action; namely, its ability to activate the mu opioid receptor and inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine.<ref name = Saudi/> Unlike tramadol, it has only weak effects on the reuptake of serotonin and is a significantly more potent opioid with no known active metabolites.<ref name = Saudi/><ref name=Expert2012>{{cite journal|last=Raffa|first=RB |title=Mechanistic and functional differentiation of tapentadol and tramadol.|journal=Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy|date=July 2012|volume=13|issue=10|pages=1437–49|doi=10.1517/14656566.2012.696097|pmid=22698264|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Tapentadol is not a [[pro-drug]] and therefore does not rely on metabolism to produce its therapeutic effects; this makes it a useful moderate-potency analgesic option for patients who do not respond adequately to more commonly used opioids due to genetic disposition (poor metabolizers of [[CYP3A4]] and [[CYP2D6]]), as well as providing a more consistent dosage-response range among the patient population.

Tapentadol was approved by the US [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] in November 2008,<ref>{{cite web|title=Nucynta History|url=http://www.drugs.com/history/nucynta.html|website=drugs.com|accessdate=April 5, 2015}}</ref> by the [[Therapeutic Goods Administration|TGA]] of Australia in December 2010<ref>{{cite web|title=PALEXIA® SR PRODUCT INFORMATION|work=TGA eBusiness Services|publisher=CSL Limited|date=26 June 2013|accessdate=2 April 2014|url=https://www.ebs.tga.gov.au/ebs/picmi/picmirepository.nsf/pdf?OpenAgent&id=CP-2011-PI-02119-3|format=PDF}}</ref> and by the [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency|MHRA]] of the UK in February 2011.1<ref>{{cite web|title=Palexia film coated tablets|work=electronic Medicines Compendium|date=13 November 2013|accessdate=2 April 2014|url=http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/28375/SPC/Palexia+film+coated+tablets/|publisher=Grunenthal Ltd}}</ref>

==Medical use==
Tapentadol is used for the treatment of moderate to severe pain for both acute (following injury, surgery, etc.) and chronic musculoskeletal pain. It is also specifically indicated for controlling the pain of [[diabetic neuropathy]] when around-the-clock opioid medication is required.<ref name=Fidman2010rev>{{cite journal|title=Role of Tapentadol Immediate Release (Nucynta) in the Management Of Moderate-to-Severe Pain|pmc=2888545|year=2010|last1=Fidman|first1=B|last2=Nogid|first2=A|volume=35|issue=6|pages=330–357|journal=Pharmacy and Therapeutics}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://reference.medscape.com/drug/nucynta-tapentadol-999202|title=Medscape-Nucynta}}</ref>

Tapentadol is Pregnancy Category C.  There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of tapentadol in pregnant women, and tapentadol is not recommended for use in women during and immediately prior to labor and delivery.<ref name=Label2013>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/022304s014s015lbl.pdf Nucynta Label], last updated October 2013.

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of tapentadol in children.<ref name=Label2013/>

==Contraindications==
Tapentadol is contraindicated in people with epilepsy or who are otherwise prone to seizures. It raises intracranial pressure so should not be used in people with head injuries, brain tumors, or other conditions which increase intracranial pressure.  It increases the risk of respiratory depression so should not be used in people with asthma.  As with other mu-opioid agonists, tapentadol may cause spasms of the [[sphincter of Oddi]], and is therefore discouraged for use in patients with [[biliary tract]] disease such as both acute and chronic [[pancreatitis]].  People who are rapid or ultra rapid metabolizers for the CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 enzymes may not respond to tapentadol therapy.  Due to reduced clearance, tapentadol should be administered with caution to people with moderate liver disease and not at all in people with severe liver disease.<ref name=Label2013/>

==Adverse effects==
The most commonly reported side effects of tapentadol therapy in clinical trials were nausea, vomiting, dizziness, sleepiness, itchiness, dry mouth, headache, and fatigue.<ref name=Fidman2010rev/>

According to the World Health Organization there is little evidence to judge the abuse potential of tapentadol.<ref name=WHO2012>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/quality_safety/5.2ExpertreviewTapentadolpre-review.pdf|publisher=Wolrd Health Organization|accessdate=16 March 2014|title=Tapentadol: Expert peer review on pre-review report|vauthors=((35th Expert Committee on Drug Dependence, Hammamet, Tunisia))|date=June 2012}}</ref>  Although early pre-clinical animal trials suggested that tapentadol has a reduced abuse liability compared to other opioid analgesics<ref name=Fidman2010rev/> the US DEA placed tapentadol into Schedule II,<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors = Leonhart MM,((Deputy Administrator, Drug Enforcement Administration))|title=Schedules of Controlled Substances: Placement of Tapentadol Into Schedule II|journal=Federal Register|date=May 2009|volume=74|issue=97|pages=23790–93}}</ref> the same category as stronger opioids more commonly used recreationally, such as morphine, oxycodone, and [[fentanyl]].<ref name=Label2013/><ref>{{cite web|title=DEA Diversion Control – Controlled Substances Schedules|url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/index.html|publisher=US Federal Government|accessdate=2012-05-16}}</ref>

Like its proto-drug, O-desmethyltramadol, tapentadol has been demonstrated to reduce the seizure threshold in patients. Tapentadol should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures, and in patients who are also taking one or more other drugs which have also been demonstrated to reduce the seizure threshold. Patients at high risk include those using other serotogenic and adrenergic medications, as well as patients with head trauma, metabolic disorders, and those in alcohol and/or drug withdrawals.<ref name="janssen-cr">{{cite web| url=https://www.janssen.com/canada/sites/www_janssen_com_canada/files/product/pdf/nuccr08052014cpm_nc.pdf | title= NUCYNTA® CR | author= Janssen Inc.}}</ref>

Tapentadol has been demonstrated to potentially produce [[hypotension]] (low blood pressure), and should be used with caution in patients with low blood pressure, and patients who are taking one or more other medications which are also known to reduce blood pressure.<ref name="janssen-cr"/>

==Interactions==
Combination with [[SSRI]]s/[[SNRI]]s, [[Serotonin releasing agent|SRA]]s, [[serotonin receptor agonist]]s and/or [[MAOI]]s may lead to potentially lethal [[serotonin syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Nossaman, V. E. |author2=Ramadhyani, U. |author3=Kadowitz, P. J. |author4=Nossaman, B. D. |title=Advances in Perioperative Pain Management: Use of Medications with Dual Analgesic Mechanisms, Tramadol & Tapentadol|journal=Anesthesiology Clinics|year=2010|volume=28|issue=4|pages=647–66|doi=10.1016/j.anclin.2010.08.009|pmid=21074743}}</ref> Combination with MAOIs may also result in an [[adrenergic storm]]. Use of tapentadol with alcohol or other sedatives such as [[benzodiazepines]], [[barbiturates]], [[nonbenzodiazepines]], [[phenothiazines]], and other opiates may result in increased impairment, sedation, respiratory depression, and death.<ref name=Fidman2010rev/> Tapentadol is partially metabolized by the hepatic enzymes CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 so it innately has interactions with drugs that enhance or repress the activity/expression of one or more of these enzymes, as well as with substrates of these enzymes (due to competition for the enzyme); some enzyme mediators/substrates require dosing adjustments to one or both medications.<ref name=Fidman2010rev/>

The combination of tapentadol and [[ethanol|alcohol]] may result in increased plasma concentrations of tapentadol and produce respiratory depression to a degree greater than the sum of the two drugs when administered separately; patients should be cautioned against alcohol consumption when taking tapentadol as the combination may be fatal.<ref  name="janssen-cr"/>

Tapentadol should be used with caution in patients who are taking one or more [[anticholinergic]] drugs, as this combination may result in urine retention (which can result in serious renal damage and is considered a medical emergency).<ref name="janssen-cr"/>

==Pharmacology==
Tapentadol is an [[agonist]] of the [[Mu opioid receptor|μ-opioid receptor]] and a [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] (NRI).<ref name=Fidman2010rev/> Analgesia occurs within 32 minutes after oral administration, and lasts for 4–6 hours.<ref name = Saudi/>  It is 18 times less potent than morphine in terms of binding to human mu-opioid receptors in [[in vitro]] research on [[human tissue]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Tapentadol#section=Pharmacology-and-Biochemistry|title=Tapentadol|author=PubChem|access-date=June 14, 2016}}{{PD-notice}}</ref> [[In vivo]], only 32% of an oral dose of tapentadol will survive [[First pass effect|first pass metabolism]] and proceed to the [[bloodstream]] to produce its effects on the [[central nervous system|central]] and [[peripheral nervous system]]s of the patient.<ref name=Fidman2010rev/>

It is similar to [[tramadol]] in its dual mechanism of action but unlike tramadol, it has much weaker effects on the reuptake of serotonin and is a significantly more potent opioid with no known active metabolites.<ref name = Saudi/><ref name=Expert2012/>

Commercial preparations contain only the (R,R) [[Chirality (chemistry)|stereoisomer]], which is the weakest isomer in terms of opioid activity.<ref name=WHO2012/> The free base conversion ratio for salts includes 0.86 for the hydrochloride.<ref>http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/quotas/2014/fr0825.htm</ref>

The peak plasma concentration ([[Cmax (pharmacology)|Cmax]]; amount of active drug in the bloodstream) is increased by 8% and 18% for tapentadol IR and ER preparations, respectively. This difference is not clinically significant, and tapentadol may be administered orally with or without food as circumstances allow, and the patient will generally not notice any change in the efficacy and/or duration of analgesic effects if the drug is not consistently administered in fasting or fed states (patients will receive the same benefits from their dose regardless of what and when they last ate). The plasma concentration of tapentadol differs to a relevant degree based on the administered dose, with the highest tested dose (250&nbsp;mg) resulting in a higher Cmax than would be expected via the dose-proportionate plasma concentration expectations.<ref name="janssen-cr"/> Increased doses of tapentadol should be anticipated to be slightly stronger than predicted by linear functions of the previous dose-response relation.

==History==
[[File:Nucynta.jpg|thumb|75 mg Nucynta (tapentadol) tablets.]]

Tapentadol was discovered by scientists at the German pharmaceutical company [[Grünenthal]] in the late 1980s led by Helmut Buschmann; the team started by analyzing the chemistry and activity of [[tramadol]], which had been discovered at the same company in 1962.<ref name=AnalogDisc2013>Helmut Buschmann. Tapentadol – From Morphine and Tramadol to the Discovery of Tapentadol. Chapter 12 in Analogue-based Drug Discovery III, First Edition. Edited by Janos Fischer, C. Robin Ganellin, and David P. Rotella. Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA. 2013.  {{ISBN|9783527651108}}</ref>{{rp|302}}  Tramadol has several [[enantiomers]], and each forms metabolites after processing in the liver.  These tramadol variants have varying activities at the [[Mu opioid receptor|μ-opioid receptor]], the [[norepinephrine transporter]], and the [[serotonin transporter]], and differing half-lives, with the metabolites having the best activity.  Using tramadol as a starting point, the team aimed to discover a single molecule that minimized the serotonin activity, had strong μ-opioid receptor agonism and strong norepinephrine reuptake inhibition, and would not require metabolism to be active; the result was tapentadol.<ref name=AnalogDisc2013/>{{rp|301–302}}

In 2003 Grünenthal partnered with two [[Johnson & Johnson]] subsidiaries, [[Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development]] and [[Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical]] to develop and market tapentadol; Johnson & Johnson had exclusive rights to sell the drug in the US, Canada, and Japan while Grünenthal retained rights elsewhere.<ref name=Essence>Dan Froicu and Raymond S Sinatra.
