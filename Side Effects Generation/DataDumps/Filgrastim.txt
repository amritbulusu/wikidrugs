Filgrastim is also used to increase the number of [[hematopoietic stem cells]] in the blood before collection by [[leukapheresis]] for use in [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]].

==Adverse effects==
The most commonly observed adverse effect is mild bone pain after repeated administration and local skin reactions at the site of injection.<ref name="AmgenRx">Neupogen {{cite web | title=Neupogen: Patient Information Leaflet | url=http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/27485 | publisher=[[Amgen]] | accessdate=24 June 2013 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110185048/http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/27485 | archivedate=10 November 2013 | df= }}</ref> Other observed adverse effects include serious allergic reactions (including a rash over the whole body, shortness of breath, wheezing, dizziness, swelling around the mouth or eyes, fast pulse, and sweating), [[ruptured spleen]] (sometimes resulting in death), [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveolar]] [[Bleeding|hemorrhage]], [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]], and [[hemoptysis]].<ref name="AmgenRx" /> Severe [[Sickle cell crisis|sickle cell crises]], in some cases resulting in death, have been associated with the use of filgrastim in patients with sickle cell disorders.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.neupogen.com/pdf/Patient_Guide_PDF.pdf | title=NEUPOGEN® Patient Guide | publisher=[[Amgen]] | accessdate=24 June 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110185000/http://www.neupogen.com/pdf/Patient_Guide_PDF.pdf | archivedate=10 November 2013 | df= }}</ref>

==Interactions==
Drug interactions between filgrastim and other drugs have not been fully evaluated. Drugs which may potentiate the release of neutrophils‚ such as [[lithium]]‚ should be used with caution.

Increased hematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been associated with transient positive bone imaging changes; this should be considered when interpreting bone-imaging results.<ref name="RX List">{{cite web | url=http://www.rxlist.com/neupogen-drug.htm | title=Neupogen | publisher=RxList | date=4 June 2012 | accessdate=23 June 2013 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702112515/http://www.rxlist.com/neupogen-drug.htm | archivedate=2 July 2013 | df= }}</ref>

Filgrastim has not been studied in pregnant women and its effects on the fetus is unknown. If taking filgrastim while pregnant, it is possible that traces of the drug could be found in the baby's blood. It is not known if the drug can get into human breast milk.

==Mechanism of action==
Filgrastim is a human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) produced by recombinant DNA technology. G-CSF regulates the production of neutrophils within the bone marrow; endogenous G-CSF is a glycoprotein produced by monocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells.

G-CSF is a colony stimulating factor which has been shown to have minimal direct in vivo or in vitro effects on the production of other haematopoietic cell types. NEUPOGEN (filgrastim) is the name for recombinant methionyl human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (r-metHuG-CSF).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amgen.ca/Neupogen_PM.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222124538/http://www.amgen.ca/Neupogen_PM.pdf |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}</ref>

==Society and culture==

===Production===
It is produced by [[recombinant DNA]] technology. The gene for human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is inserted into the genetic material of ''[[Escherichia coli]]''.  The G-CSF then produced by ''E. coli'' is different from G-CSF naturally made in humans.

===Commercialization===
Filgrastim is marketed under several brand names, including:

And under the BPCI Act, only a biologic that has been approved as an “interchangeable” may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product. The FDA said its approval of Zarxio is based on review of evidence that included structural and functional characterization, animal study data, human pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics data, clinical immunogenicity data and other clinical safety and effectiveness data that demonstrates [[Zarxio]] is biosimilar to Neupogen.<ref name="NYT_Zarxio" />

{{quote|Zarxio is approved for the same indications as Neupogen, and can be prescribed by a health care professional for: patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy; patients with acute myeloid leukemia receiving induction or consolidation chemotherapy; patients with cancer undergoing bone marrow transplantation; patients undergoing autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell collection and therapy; and patients with severe chronic neutropenia.|FDA, March 6, 2015}}
