'''UCB''' (''Union Chimique Belge'') is a [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[biopharmaceutical]] company headquartered in [[Brussels]], Belgium. UCB is an international company with a revenue of € 4.178 billion  in 2016<ref name="ucb.com">http://www.ucb.com/investors/Financials/Key-figures</ref> which focuses primarily on research and development, specifically involving medications centered on epilepsy, Parkinson's, and Crohn's diseases.<ref>http://www.ucb.com/investors/Financials</ref> The Company's efforts are focused on treatments for severe diseases treated by specialists, particularly in the fields of [[central nervous system]] (CNS) disorders (including [[epilepsy]]), [[inflammation|inflammatory]] disorders (including [[allergy]]), and [[oncology]].

Every three years, the company presents the UCB Award under the patronage of the [[Queen Elisabeth Medical Foundation]] to promote neuroscience research. The winner of this award is selected by an independent scientific committee.

== History ==

UCB was founded on 18 January 1928 by [[Emmanuel Janssen]], a Belgian businessman. Initially focused on [[industrial chemical]]s (it was one of the first companies to distill ammonia from coal), the company also included a small pharmaceutical division based around '''Meurice Laboratories'''.

In the early 1950s, UCB set up a research centre where new medicines such as ''Atarax'' ([[hydroxyzine]]) were developed. Successful sales enabled the pharmaceutical division to expand, and led to the discovery of another important compound, called [[piracetam]]. This was marketed in the 1970s as ''Nootropil'' and used to treat memory and [[Balance disorder|balance problems]]. It remains one of UCB's key products. At this time, UCB was a company focusing on three core areas: [[pharmaceutical]]s, [[chemical]]s and [[film]]s.

The success of ''Nootropil'' made it possible for UCB to build a modern pharmaceutical site in [[Braine-l'Alleud]], south of Brussels. There, UCB developed ''Zyrtec'' ([[cetirizine]]), a [[blockbuster drug|blockbuster]] [[antihistamine]]. Other important products have followed including ''Keppra'' ([[levetiracetam]]), ''Xyzal'' ([[levocetirizine]]), and ''Cimzia'' ([[certolizumab pegol]]), which was acquired through the acquisition of Celltech.

At the end of 2002, the chemicals and films divisions were merged and UCB added the [[resin]]s, [[Chemical additive|additive]]s and [[adhesive]]s activities of [[Solutia]], to form the surface specialties division. The films part has since been sold to [[Innovia Films]] in September 2004. The chemicals division, Methylamines and Derivatives was spun off and later sold to form the company Taminco.

In May 2004, UCB acquired the British biotechnology company  ''[[Celltech]]'', followed in March 2005 by the sale of the surface specialties to [[Cytec Industries]]. By divesting all of its non-pharmaceutical activities, and acquiring Celltech for a mere $1 billion, UCB transformed itself into a global biopharmaceutical company.<ref>{{cite news

In 2006, UCB started the purchase of the German pharmaceutical company ''[[Schwarz Pharma|Schwarz]]'' for 4 [[1000000000 (4)|billion]].<ref>UCB S.A. [http://hugin.info/133973/R/1077360/185588.pdf Press Release of 25 September 2006]; accessed on 12 September 2008.</ref> {{As of|2007|7}}, UCB holds approximately 87% of Schwarz's [[Shares outstanding|outstanding shares]]. The purchase of Schwarz enabled UCB to introduce two new drugs against CNS disorders: ''Neupro'' ([[rotigotine]]), a [[transdermal patch]] for treatment of [[Parkinson's disease]] and ''Vimpat'' ([[lacosamide]]), a new [[anticonvulsant]]. Another new drug of the Schwarz [[portfolio (finance)|portfolio]], ''Toviaz'' ([[fesoterodine]]), a compound to treat [[overactive bladder]], was licensed to [[Pfizer]] in 2006.

In 2008, UCB established a multi-year collaboration with [[Beryllium (company)|Beryllium]], a developer of treatments for immune and CNS disorders.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=|title=UCB Gains Noncontrolling Interest in Beryllium|last=Staff|date=15 June 2014|work=[[Gen. Eng. Biotechnol.

In November 2014, UCB announced its intention to sell of its generics subsidiary (Kremers Urban Pharmaceuticals) for more than $1.5 billion to two private equity firms.<ref>http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/ucb-sells-generics-subsidiary-for-1-525b/81250569/</ref>
