'''Rubitecan''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], marketing name '''Orathecin''') is an oral [[topoisomerase]] inhibitor, developed by Supergen. 

==History==
On January 27, 2004, Supergen announced that it has completed the submission of an NDA for rubitecan to the US FDA,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drugs.com/nda/orathecin_040128.html |title=Drugs.com, SuperGen completes submission of New Drug Application (NDA) for Orathecin as an oral treatment for pancreatic cancer |accessdate=2008-03-25 |format= |work= }}</ref> and was accepted for filing on March 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drugs.com/nda/orathecin_040326.html |title=Drugs.com, SuperGen’s New Drug Application for Orathecin (rubitecan) capsules accepted by FDA for filing |accessdate=2008-03-25 |format= |work= }}</ref>
