'''Ethanol''', also called '''alcohol''', '''ethyl alcohol''', and '''drinking alcohol''', is a [[chemical compound|compound]] and simple [[alcohol]] with the [[chemical formula]] {{chem|C|2|H|5|OH}}. Its formula can be written also as {{chem|C|H|3}}−{{chem|C|H|2}}−{{chem|O|H}} or {{chem|C|2|H|5}}−{{chem|O|H}} (an [[ethyl group]] linked to a [[hydroxyl]] group), and is often abbreviated as '''EtOH'''. Ethanol is a [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]], [[flammability|flammable]], colorless liquid with a slight characteristic odor. It is [[alcohol (drug)|used as a drug]] and is the principal type of alcohol found in [[alcoholic drink]]s.

Ethanol is naturally produced by the [[fermentation]] of [[sugar]]s by [[yeast]]s or via [[petrochemistry|petrochemical]] processes, and is most commonly considered as a popular [[recreational drug]]. It also has medical applications as an [[antiseptic]] and [[disinfectant]]. The compound is widely used as a [[chemistry|chemical]] [[solvent]], either for scientific chemical testing or in [[chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of other [[organic compound]]s, and is a vital substance utilized across many different kinds of manufacturing industries. Ethanol is also used as a clean energy burning [[alcohol fuel|fuel]] source.

==Etymology==
''Ethanol'' is the [[systematic name]] defined by the [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry|International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)]] for a compound consisting of [[alkyl group]] with two carbon [[atom]]s (prefix "eth-"), having a single bond between them (infix "-an-"), attached [[functional group]]-OH group (suffix "-ol").<ref name="Pubchem">{{cite web|title = Ethanol – Compound Summary|url = https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=702|work = The PubChem Project|location = USA|publisher = National Center for Biotechnology Information}}</ref>

The "eth-" prefix and the qualifier "ethyl" in "ethyl alcohol" originally come from the name "ethyl" assigned in 1834 to the group {{chem|C|2|H|5}}- by [[Justus von Liebig|Justus Liebig]]. He coined the word from the [[German language|German]] name ''Aether'' of the compound {{chem|C|2|H|5}}-O-{{chem|C|2|H|5}} (commonly called "ether" in [[English language|English]], more specifically called "[[diethyl ether]]").<ref>Liebig, Justus (1834) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002457887;view=1up;seq=13 "Ueber die Constitution des Aethers und seiner Verbindungen"]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (On the constitution of ether and its compounds), ''Annalen der Pharmacie'', '''9''' : 1–39. From page 18: "''Bezeichnen wir die Kohlenwasserstoffverbindung 4C + 10H als das Radikal des Aethers mit E<sub>2</sub> und nennen es Ethyl'', ..." (Let us designate the hydrocarbon compound 4C + 10H as the radical of ether with E<sub>2</sub> and name it ethyl ...).</ref> According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], ''Ethyl'' is a contraction of the Ancient Greek αἰθήρ (aithḗr, “upper air”) and the Greek word ''{{lang|grc|ύλη}}'' (''hyle'', substance).<ref>{{OEtymD|ethyl}}</ref>

The name ''ethanol'' was coined as a result of a resolution that was adopted at the International Conference on Chemical Nomenclature that was held in April 1892 in Geneva, Switzerland.<ref>For a report on the 1892 International Conference on Chemical Nomenclature, see:
* {{cite journal|author=Armstrong, Henry |year=1892|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=LHkCAAAAIAAJ|page=56}} |title=The International Conference on Chemical Nomenclature|journal=Nature|volume=46|pages=56–59|doi=10.1038/046056c0|issue=1177|bibcode=1892Natur..46...56A}}

The term "[[alcohol]]" now refers to a wider class of substances in chemistry nomenclature, but in common parlance it remains the name of ethanol. The Oxford English Dictionary claims that it is a medieval loan from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''[[Kohl (cosmetics)|al-kuḥl]]'', a powdered ore of antimony used since antiquity as a cosmetic, and retained that meaning in [[Middle Latin]].<ref>[[OED]]; [[etymonline.com]]</ref> The use of "alcohol" for ethanol (in full, "alcohol of wine") is modern, first recorded 1753, and by the later 17th century referred to "any sublimated substance; [[Distilled beverage|distilled spirit]]" use for "the spirit of wine" (shortened from a full expression ''alcohol of wine''). The systematic use in chemistry dates to 1850.

==Uses==

===Medical===
{{Main|Alcohol (medicine)}}

====Antiseptic====
Ethanol is used in medical wipes and most common antibacterial [[hand sanitizer]] gels as an [[antiseptic]]. Ethanol kills organisms by [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturing]] their [[protein]]s and dissolving their [[lipid]]s and is effective against most [[bacteria]] and [[fungus|fungi]], and many [[virus]]es. However, ethanol is ineffective against bacterial [[Endospore|spores]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=McDonnell G, Russell AD|title=Antiseptics and disinfectants: activity, action, and resistance|journal=Clin.

The largest single use of ethanol is as an engine [[fuel]] and [[fuel additive]]. [[Brazil]] in particular relies heavily upon the use of ethanol as an engine fuel, due in part to its role as the globe's leading producer of ethanol.<ref>{{cite web|title=Availability of Sources of E85|url=http://www.cleanairtrust.org/Sources-Availability-E85.html|website=Clean Air Trust|accessdate=2015-07-27}}</ref> [[Gasoline]] sold in Brazil contains at least 25% [[anhydrous]] ethanol. Hydrous ethanol (about 95% ethanol and 5% water) can be used as fuel in more than 90% of new gasoline fueled cars sold in the country.

====Rocket fuel====
Ethanol was commonly used as fuel in early [[bipropellant]] [[rocket]] (liquid propelled) vehicles, in conjunction with an [[oxidizer]] such as liquid oxygen. The German [[V-2 rocket]] of [[World War II]], credited with beginning the space age, used ethanol, mixed with 25% of water to reduce the combustion chamber temperature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/V/V-2.html|title=The Internet Encyclopedia of Science: V-2|author=Darling, David}}</ref><ref name="braeunig">Braeunig, Robert A.

====Fuel cells====
Commercial fuel cells operate on reformed natural gas, [[hydrogen]] or [[methanol]]. Ethanol is an attractive alternative due to its wide availability, low cost, high purity and low toxicity. There are a wide range of fuel cell concepts that have been trialled including [[direct-ethanol fuel cell]]s, auto-thermal reforming systems and thermally integrated systems. The majority of work is being conducted at a research level although there are a number of organizations at the beginning of commercialization of ethanol fuel cells.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Badwal|first1=S.P.S.|last2=Giddey|first2=S.|last3=Kulkarni|first3=A.|last4=Goel|first4=J.|last5=Basu|first5=S.|title=Direct ethanol fuel cells for transport and stationary applications – A comprehensive review|journal=Applied Energy|date=May 2015|volume=145|pages=80–103|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.02.002}}</ref>

====Household heating====
Ethanol fireplaces can be used for home heating or for decoration.<ref>{{cite news|title=Can Ethanol Fireplaces Be Cozy?|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/one-fire-please-hold-the-soot-1449170833|accessdate=2 March 2016|agency=Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

{{Further|<!-- Chemical derivatives of ethanol -->#Reactions}}

Ethanol is an important industrial ingredient. It has widespread use as a precursor for other organic compounds such as ethyl [[halide]]s, ethyl [[ester]]s, diethyl ether, acetic acid, and ethyl [[amine]]s.

===Solvent===
Ethanol is [[miscible]] with [[water (molecule)|water]] and is a good general purpose [[solvent]]. It is found in [[paint]]s, [[tincture]]s, markers, and personal care products such as mouthwashes, perfumes and deodorants. However, [[polysaccharides]] [[Ethanol precipitation|precipitate]] from aqueous solution in the presence of alcohol, and ethanol precipitation is used for this reason in the purification of [[DNA]] and [[RNA]].

===Low-temperature liquid===
Because of its low melting point (−114.14&nbsp;°C) and low toxicity, ethanol is sometimes used in laboratories (with [[dry ice]] or other coolants) as a [[cooling bath]] to keep vessels at temperatures below the freezing point of water. For the same reason, it is also used as the active fluid in [[alcohol thermometer]]s.

==Chemistry==
{{Further|Ethanol (data page)}}

===Chemical formula===
Ethanol is a 2-carbon alcohol. Its [[chemical formula|molecular formula]] is CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH. An alternative notation is CH<sub>3</sub>−CH<sub>2</sub>−OH, which indicates that the carbon of a [[methyl group]] (CH<sub>3</sub>−) is attached to the carbon of a [[methylene group]] (−CH<sub>2</sub>–), which is attached to the oxygen of a [[Hydroxyl|hydroxyl group (−OH)]]. It is a constitutional [[isomer]] of [[dimethyl ether]]. Ethanol is sometimes abbreviated as '''EtOH''', using the common organic chemistry notation of representing the ethyl group (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>−) with '''Et'''.

===Physical properties===
[[File:Spiritusflamme mit spektrum.png|thumb|upright|Ethanol burning with its spectrum depicted]]
Ethanol is a volatile, colorless liquid that has a slight odor. It burns with a smokeless blue flame that is not always visible in normal light. The physical properties of ethanol stem primarily from the presence of its [[hydroxyl]] group and the shortness of its carbon chain. Ethanol's hydroxyl group is able to participate in hydrogen bonding, rendering it more viscous and less volatile than less polar organic compounds of similar molecular weight, such as [[propane]].

Ethanol is slightly more refractive than water, having a [[refractive index]] of 1.36242 (at λ=589.3&nbsp;nm and {{convert|18.35|C|F|disp=or}}).<ref name="crc" /> The [[triple point]] for ethanol is {{nowrap|150 [[Kelvin|K]]}} at a pressure of {{nowrap|4.3 × 10<sup>−4</sup> [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webanswers.com/science/what-is-the-triple-point-of-alcohol-a821b3 |publisher=Webanswers.com |title=What is the triple point of alcohol? |date=31 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514151711/http://www.webanswers.com/science/what-is-the-triple-point-of-alcohol-a821b3 |archivedate=14 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}{{SCICN|date=February 2014}}</ref>

===Solvent properties===
Ethanol is a versatile solvent, [[miscible]] with water and with many organic solvents, including [[acetic acid]], [[acetone]], [[benzene]], [[carbon tetrachloride]], [[chloroform]], [[diethyl ether]], [[ethylene glycol]], [[glycerol]], [[nitromethane]], [[pyridine]], and [[toluene]].<ref name="crc" /><ref name="merck" /> It is also miscible with light aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as [[pentane]] and [[hexane]], and with aliphatic chlorides such as [[1,1,1-Trichloroethane|trichloroethane]] and [[tetrachloroethylene]].<ref name="merck">{{cite book|author=Windholz, Martha|title=The Merck index: an encyclopedia of chemicals and drugs|publisher=Merck|location=Rahway, N.J., U.S.A|year=1976|isbn=0-911910-26-3|edition=9th}}{{page needed|date=February 2014}}</ref>

The miscibility gap tends to get wider with higher alkanes and the temperature for complete miscibility increases.

[[File:Ethanol-xtal-1976-3D-balls.png|thumb|300px|Hydrogen bonding in solid ethanol at −186&nbsp;°C]]

Hydrogen bonding causes pure ethanol to be [[hygroscopic]] to the extent that it readily absorbs water from the air. The polar nature of the hydroxyl group causes ethanol to dissolve many ionic compounds, notably [[sodium hydroxide|sodium]] and [[potassium hydroxide]]s, [[magnesium chloride]], [[calcium chloride]], [[ammonium chloride]], [[ammonium bromide]], and [[sodium bromide]].<ref name="merck" /> [[Sodium chloride|Sodium]] and [[potassium chloride]]s are slightly soluble in ethanol.<ref name="merck" /> Because the ethanol molecule also has a nonpolar end, it will also dissolve nonpolar substances, including most [[essential oil]]s<ref name="merckoils">''Merck Index of Chemicals and Drugs'', 9th ed.; monographs 6575 through 6669</ref> and numerous flavoring, coloring, and medicinal agents.

The addition of even a few percent of ethanol to water sharply reduces the [[surface tension]] of water. This property partially explains the "[[tears of wine]]" phenomenon. When wine is swirled in a glass, ethanol evaporates quickly from the thin film of wine on the wall of the glass. As the wine's ethanol content decreases, its surface tension increases and the thin film "beads up" and runs down the glass in channels rather than as a smooth sheet.

===Flammability===
An ethanol-water solution that contains 40% alcohol by weight will catch fire if heated to about {{convert|26|°C|°F}} and if an ignition source is applied to it. This is called its [[flash point]].<ref name="flash point">{{cite web|url=http://www.nttworldwide.com/tech2212.htm |title=Flash Point and Fire Point |website=Nttworldwide.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214222420/http://www.nttworldwide.com/tech2212.htm |archivedate=14 December 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref> The flash point of pure ethanol is {{convert|16.60|°C|°F}}, less than average room temperature. <!-- Weight % and volume % (ABV) are not the same.

===Fermentation===
{{Main article|Ethanol fermentation}}
{{See also|Yeast in winemaking}}

Ethanol in [[alcoholic beverage]]s and fuel is produced by fermentation. Certain species of [[yeast]] (e.g., ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'') [[metabolism|metabolize]] [[polysaccharide|sugar]], producing ethanol and carbon dioxide. The chemical equations below summarize the conversion:

: [[glucose|{{chem|C|6|H|12|O|6}}]] → 2 {{chem|CH|3|C|H|2|O}}H + 2 CO<sub>2</sub>
: [[sucrose|{{chem|C|12|H|22|O|11}}]] + {{chem|H|2|O}} → 4 {{chem|CH|3|C|H|2|O}}H + 4 CO<sub>2</sub>

Fermentation is the process of culturing yeast under favorable thermal conditions to produce alcohol. This process is carried out at around {{convert|35|-|40|C|F}}. Toxicity of ethanol to yeast limits the ethanol concentration obtainable by brewing; higher concentrations, therefore, are obtained by [[Fortified wine|fortification]] or [[distillation]]. The most ethanol-tolerant yeast strains can survive up to approximately 18% ethanol by volume.

To produce ethanol from starchy materials such as [[cereal grain]]s, the [[starch]] must first be converted into sugars. In brewing [[beer]], this has traditionally been accomplished by allowing the grain to germinate, or [[malt]], which produces the [[enzyme]] [[amylase]]. When the malted grain is [[mashing|mashed]], the amylase converts the remaining starches into sugars.

====Cellulose====
{{Main article|Cellulosic ethanol}}

Sugars for [[ethanol fermentation]] can be obtained from [[cellulose]]. Deployment of this technology could turn a number of cellulose-containing agricultural by-products, such as [[corncob]]s, [[straw]], and [[sawdust]], into renewable energy resources. Other agricultural residues such as sugar cane bagasse and [[energy crop]]s such as [[switchgrass]] may also be a sources of fermentable sugars.<ref>{{cite web|author=Clines, Tom|title=Brew Better Ethanol|publisher=Popular Science Online|date=July 2006|url=http://www.popsci.com/popsci/energy/6756226d360ab010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103083747/http://www.popsci.com/popsci/energy/6756226d360ab010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html|archivedate=3 November 2007}}</ref>

===Testing===
[[File:EthanolMIRInfraredSpectra.PNG|thumb|300px|Infrared reflection spectra of liquid ethanol, showing the -OH band centered at ≈3300&nbsp;cm<sup>−1</sup> and C-H bands at ≈2950&nbsp;cm<sup>−1</sup>.]]

[[Image:Ethanol near IR spectrum.png|thumb|300px|[[Near infrared spectrum]] of liquid ethanol.]]

Breweries and [[biofuel]] plants employ two methods for measuring ethanol concentration. Infrared ethanol sensors measure the vibrational frequency of dissolved ethanol using the CH band at 2900&nbsp;cm<sup>−1</sup>. This method uses a relatively inexpensive solid state sensor that compares the CH band with a reference band to calculate the ethanol content. The calculation makes use of the [[Beer-Lambert law]]. Alternatively, by measuring the density of the starting material and the density of the product, using a [[hydrometer]], the change in specific gravity during fermentation indicates the alcohol content. This inexpensive and indirect method has a long history in the beer brewing industry.

==Purification==

===Distillation===
Ethylene hydration or brewing produces an ethanol–water mixture. For most industrial and fuel uses, the ethanol must be purified. [[Fractional distillation]] at atmospheric pressure can concentrate ethanol to 95.6% by weight (89.5 mole%). This mixture is an [[azeotrope]] with a boiling point of {{convert|78.1|C|F}}, and ''cannot'' be further purified by distillation. Addition of an entraining agent, such as [[benzene]], [[cyclohexane]], or [[heptane]], allows a new ternary azeotrope comprising the ethanol, water, and the entraining agent to be formed. This lower-boiling ternary azeotrope is removed preferentially, leading to water-free ethanol.<ref name="ullmann">Naim Kosaric, Zdravko Duvnjak, Adalbert Farkas, Hermann Sahm, Stephanie Bringer-Meyer, Otto Goebel and Dieter Mayer in "Ethanol" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2011, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a09_587.pub2}}{{subscription required}}</ref>

At pressures less than atmospheric pressure, the composition of the ethanol-water azeotrope shifts to more ethanol-rich mixtures, and at pressures less than 70&nbsp;[[torr]] (9.333&nbsp;kPa), there is no azeotrope, and it is possible to distill absolute ethanol from an ethanol-water mixture. While vacuum distillation of ethanol is not presently economical, pressure-swing distillation is a topic of current research. In this technique, a reduced-pressure distillation first yields an ethanol-water mixture of more than 95.6% ethanol. Then, fractional distillation of this mixture at atmospheric pressure distills off the 95.6% azeotrope, leaving anhydrous ethanol at the bottom.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Molecular sieves and desiccants===
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2015}}

Apart from distillation, ethanol may be dried by addition of a [[desiccant]], such as [[molecular sieves]], [[cellulose]], and [[cornmeal]]. The desiccants can be dried and reused.<ref name="ullmann" /> [[Molecular sieve]]s can be used to selectively absorb the water from the 95.6% ethanol solution. Synthetic [[zeolite]] in pellet form can be used, as well as a variety of plant-derived absorbents, including [[cornmeal]], [[straw]], and [[sawdust]]. The zeolite bed can be regenerated essentially an unlimited number of times by drying it with a blast of hot [[carbon dioxide]]. Cornmeal and other plant-derived absorbents cannot readily be regenerated, but where ethanol is made from grain, they are often available at low cost. Absolute ethanol produced this way has no residual benzene, and can be used to fortify port and sherry in traditional winery operations.

===Membranes and reverse osmosis===
Membranes can also be used to separate ethanol and water. Membrane-based separations are not subject to the limitations of the water-ethanol azeotrope because the separations are not based on vapor-liquid equilibria. Membranes are often used in the so-called hybrid membrane distillation process. This process uses a pre-concentration distillation column as first separating step. The further separation is then accomplished with a membrane operated either in vapor permeation or pervaporation mode. Vapor permeation uses a vapor membrane feed and pervaporation uses a liquid membrane feed.

===Other techniques===
A variety of other techniques have been discussed, including the following:<ref name="ullmann" />

* Salting using [[potassium carbonate]] to exploit its insolubility will cause a phase separation with ethanol and water. This offers a very small potassium carbonate impurity to the alcohol that can be removed by distillation. This method is very useful in purification of ethanol by distillation, as ethanol forms an [[azeotrope]] with water.
* Direct [[electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide]] to ethanol under ambient conditions using copper nanoparticles on a carbon nanospike film as the catalyst;<ref>{{cite journal | last=Song | first=Yang | last2=Peng | first2=Rui | last3=Hensley | first3=Dale K. | last4=Bonnesen | first4=Peter V. | last5=Liang | first5=Liangbo | last6=Wu | first6=Zili | last7=Meyer, III | first7=Harry M. | last8=Chi | first8=Miaofang | last9=Ma | first9=Cheng | last10=Sumpter | first10=Bobby G. | last11=Rondinone | first11=Adam J. | date=2016 | title=High-Selectivity Electrochemical Conversion of CO2 to Ethanol using a Copper Nanoparticle/N-Doped Graphene Electrode| journal=ChemistrySelect | issue=Preprint | doi=10.1002/slct.201601169 | volume=1 | pages=6055–6061}}</ref>

===Grades of ethanol===

====Denatured alcohol====
{{Main article|Denatured alcohol}}

Pure ethanol and alcoholic beverages are heavily [[Sin tax|taxed]] as psychoactive drugs, but ethanol has many uses that do not involve its consumption. To relieve the tax burden on these uses, most jurisdictions waive the tax when an agent has been added to the ethanol to render it unfit to drink. These include [[bitterant|bittering agents]] such as [[denatonium benzoate]] and toxins such as [[methanol]], [[naphtha]], and [[pyridine]]. Products of this kind are called ''denatured alcohol.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.procurement.umich.edu/Contracts/Denatured_Alchohol.pdf|title=U-M Program to Reduce the Consumption of Tax-free Alcohol; Denatured Alcohol a Safer, Less Expensive Alternative|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=29 September 2007|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127095510/http://www.procurement.umich.edu/Contracts/Denatured_Alchohol.pdf|archivedate=27 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>Great Britain (2005).

====Absolute alcohol====
Absolute or anhydrous alcohol refers to ethanol with a low water content. There are various grades with maximum water contents ranging from 1% to a few parts per million (ppm) levels. If [[azeotropic distillation]] is used to remove water, it will contain trace amounts of the material separation agent (e.g. benzene).<ref>{{cite book|first=Raj K. |last=Bansal |last2=Bernthsen |first2=August |title=A Textbook of Organic Chemistry|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=1B6ijcTkD5EC|page=402}}|year=2003|publisher=New Age International Limited|isbn=978-81-224-1459-2|pages=402–}}</ref> Absolute alcohol is not intended for human consumption. Absolute ethanol is used as a solvent for laboratory and industrial applications, where water will react with other chemicals, and as fuel alcohol. Spectroscopic ethanol is an absolute ethanol with a low absorbance in [[ultraviolet]] and visible light, fit for use as a solvent in [[ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy]].<ref>Christian, Gary D. (2003) ''Analytical chemistry'', Vol. 1, Wiley, {{ISBN|0-471-21472-8}}{{page needed|date=February 2014}}</ref>

Pure ethanol is classed as 200 [[proof (alcohol)|proof]] in the U.S., equivalent to 175 degrees proof in the UK system.<ref name="Andrews2007">{{cite book|first=Sudhir |last=Andrews|title=Textbook Of Food & Bevrge Mgmt|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=HfHtaq1GWUcC&|page=268}}|date=1 August 2007|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07-065573-7|pages=268–}}</ref>

====Rectified spirits====
Rectified spirit, an azeotropic composition of 96% ethanol containing 4% water, is used instead of anhydrous ethanol for various purposes. Wine spirits are about 94% ethanol (188 [[proof (alcohol)|proof]]). The impurities are different from those in 95% (190 proof) laboratory ethanol.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Appl Microbiol.|year=1968|volume=16|issue=7|pmc=547590|title=Sugar and Alcohol Stabilization of Yeast in Sweet Wine|author1=Kunkee, Ralph E. |author2=Amerine, Maynard A. |pmid=5664123|pages=1067–75}}</ref>

==Reactions==
{{Details|Alcohol}}

Ethanol is classified as a primary alcohol, meaning that the carbon its hydroxyl group attaches to has at least two hydrogen atoms attached to it as well. Many ethanol reactions occur at its [[hydroxyl]] group.

===Ester formation===
In the presence of acid catalysts, ethanol reacts with [[carboxylic acid]]s to produce ethyl [[ester]]s and water:
:[[carboxylic acid|RCOOH]] + HOCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> → [[ester|RCOOCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>]] + H<sub>2</sub>O
This reaction, which is conducted on large scale industrially, requires the removal of the water from the reaction mixture as it is formed. Esters react in the presence of an acid or base to give back the alcohol and a salt. This reaction is known as [[saponification]] because it is used in the preparation of soap. Ethanol can also form esters with inorganic acids. [[Diethyl sulfate]] and [[triethyl phosphate]] are prepared by treating ethanol with sulfur trioxide and [[phosphorus pentoxide]] respectively. [[Diethyl sulfate]] is a useful ethylating agent in [[organic synthesis]]. [[Ethyl nitrite]], prepared from the reaction of ethanol with [[sodium nitrite]] and sulfuric acid, was formerly used as a [[diuretic]].

===Dehydration===
Strong acid desiccants cause the partial dehydration of ethanol to form [[diethyl ether]] and other byproducts. If the dehydration temperature exceeds around {{convert|160|C|F}}, full dehydration will occur and [[ethylene]] will be the main product.
:2 CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH → [[diethyl ether|CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>]] + H<sub>2</sub>O (ca. 120 °C)
:&nbsp;&nbsp; CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH → [[ethylene|H2C=CH2]] + H<sub>2</sub>O (above 160 °C)

===Combustion===
Complete [[combustion]] of ethanol forms [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water]]:
:C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH (l) + 3 O<sub>2</sub> (g) → 2 CO<sub>2</sub> (g) + 3 H<sub>2</sub>O (l); −ΔH<sub>c</sub> = 1371&nbsp;kJ/mol<ref>{{cite journal|title=Heats of Formation of Simple Organic Molecules|author=Rossini, Frederick D. |journal=Ind. Eng. Chem.|year=1937|volume=29|pages=1424–1430|doi=10.1021/ie50336a024|issue=12}}</ref> = 29.8&nbsp;kJ/g = 327&nbsp;kcal/mol = 7.1&nbsp;kcal/g

:C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH (l) + 3 O<sub>2</sub> (g) → 2 CO<sub>2</sub> (g) + 3 H<sub>2</sub>O (g); −ΔH<sub>c</sub> = 1236&nbsp;kJ/mol = 26.8&nbsp;kJ/g = 295.4&nbsp;kcal/mol = 6.41 kcal/g<ref>Calculated from heats of formation from CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 49th Edition, 1968–1969.</ref>

Specific heat = 2.44 kJ/(kg·K)

===Acid-base chemistry===
Ethanol is a neutral molecule and the [[pH]] of a solution of ethanol in water is nearly 7.00. Ethanol can be quantitatively converted to its [[conjugate base]], the [[Alkoxide|ethoxide]] ion (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O<sup>−</sup>), by reaction with an [[alkali metal]] such as [[sodium]]:<ref name="m_and_b" />
:2 CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH + 2 Na → 2 CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>ONa + H<sub>2</sub>
or a very strong base such as [[sodium hydride]]:
:CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH + NaH → CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>ONa + H<sub>2</sub>
The acidity of water and ethanol are nearly the same, as indicated by their [[Acid dissociation constant|pKa]] of 15.7 and 16 respectively. Thus, sodium ethoxide and [[sodium hydroxide]] exist in an equilibrium that is closely balanced:
:CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH + NaOH {{eqm}} CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>ONa + H<sub>2</sub>O

===Halogenation===
Ethanol is not used industrially as a precursor to ethyl halides, but the reactions are illustrative. Ethanol reacts with [[hydrogen halide]]s to produce [[haloalkane|ethyl halides]] such as [[ethyl chloride]] and [[ethyl bromide]] via an [[SN2 reaction|S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction]]:
:CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH + [[hydrogen chloride|HCl]] → CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>Cl + H<sub>2</sub>O
These reactions require a catalyst such as [[zinc chloride]].<ref name="s_and_h">{{cite book |author1=[[Andrew Streitwieser|Streitweiser, Andrew Jr.]] |author2=[[Clayton Heathcock|Heathcock, Clayton H.]]|title=Introduction to Organic Chemistry|year=1976|publisher=MacMillan|isbn=0-02-418010-6}}</ref>
HBr requires [[refluxing]] with a [[sulfuric acid]] catalyst.<ref name="s_and_h" /> Ethyl halides can, in principle, also be produced by treating ethanol with more specialized [[Halogenation|halogenating agents]], such as [[thionyl chloride]] or [[phosphorus tribromide]].<ref name="m_and_b" /><ref name="s_and_h" />
:CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH + SOCl<sub>2</sub> → CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>Cl + SO<sub>2</sub> + HCl

Upon treatment with halogens in the presence of base, ethanol gives the corresponding [[haloform]] (CHX<sub>3</sub>, where X = Cl, Br, I). This conversion is called the [[haloform reaction]].<ref>Chakrabartty, in Trahanovsky, ''Oxidation in Organic Chemistry'', pp 343–370, Academic Press, New York, '''1978'''</ref> "
An intermediate in the reaction with chlorine is the [[aldehyde]] called [[chloral]], which forms [[chloral hydrate]] upon reaction with water:<ref name=Ull>Reinhard Jira, Erwin Kopp, Blaine C. McKusick, Gerhard Röderer, Axel Bosch and Gerald Fleischmann "Chloroacetaldehydes" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2007, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a06_527.pub2}}</ref>
:4 Cl<sub>2</sub> + CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH → CCl<sub>3</sub>CHO + 5 HCl
:CCl<sub>3</sub>CHO + H<sub>2</sub>O → CCl<sub>3</sub>C(OH)<sub>2</sub>H

===Oxidation===
Ethanol can be oxidized to [[acetaldehyde]] and further oxidized to [[acetic acid]], depending on the reagents and conditions.<ref name="s_and_h" /> This oxidation is of no importance industrially, but in the human body, these oxidation reactions are catalyzed by the [[enzyme]] [[liver alcohol dehydrogenase]]. The oxidation product of ethanol, acetic acid, is a nutrient for humans, being a precursor to [[acetyl CoA]], where the acetyl group can be spent as energy or used for biosynthesis.
