'''Renzapride''' is a [[gastroprokinetic agent]] and [[antiemetic]] which acts as a full [[5-HT4|5-HT<sub>4</sub>]] [[full agonist]] and [[5-HT3|5-HT<sub>3</sub>]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]].<ref name="pmid18095752">{{cite journal | vauthors = Meyers NL, Hickling RI | title = Pharmacology and metabolism of renzapride : a novel therapeutic agent for the potential treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. | journal = Drugs R D. | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 37â€“63 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18095752 }}</ref><ref>Camilleri M., McKinzie S., Fox J., Foxx-Orenstein A., Burton D., Thomforde G., Baxter K. and Zinsmeister A. R. (2004). "Effect of Renzapride on Transit in Constipation-Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome", ''Clin. Gastroent. and Hepatology''; '''2''':895-904</ref> It also functions as a [[5-HT2B receptor|5-HT<sub>2B</sub>]] antagonist and has some affinity for the [[5-HT2A|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]] and [[5-HT2C|5-HT<sub>2C</sub>]] receptors.<ref name="pmid18095752" />

Renzapride was being developed by Alizyme plc of the United Kingdom. In May 2016, [[EndoLogic]] LLC, a US based pharmaceutical and medical device company acquired the US and world wide patent rights to Renzapride. EndoLogic plans to develop Renzapride for the treatment of gastroparesis.

[[Gastroparesis]] is a common condition affecting more than 20 million people in the US including 5 million diabetics. Currently, only one drug, [[metoclopramide]], dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, is FDA approved for the treatment of gastroparesis in the US.

Patients treated with metoclopramide are at risk for serious side effects, some of which are permanent, such as [[tardive dyskinesia]], hence limiting the use of metoclopramide to no more than 12 weeks.

== Clinical trials ==

Renzapride was being investigated for the treatment of constipation-predominant [[irritable bowel syndrome]] (IBS-C). It is also potentially effective for [[irritable bowel syndrome]] with alternating stool pattern (IBS-A).  It is being developed by [[Alizyme]] [[Public limited company|plc]] of the United Kingdom.

As of 23 April 2008, Alizyme ceased all development of renzapride, after a Phase III trial in the U.S. did not show enough efficacy over placebo to justify further development.<ref name=developmenthalted>{{cite press release |url=http://www.alizyme.com/alizyme/media/press/show.jsp?ref=128 |title=Results from Renzapride |date=23 April 2008 |publisher=Alizyme plc |accessdate=7 May 2009}}</ref>
