==Medical uses==
Primary uses include [[nausea]], [[vomiting]] and [[dizziness]] associated with [[motion sickness]], [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]] and post-operatively following administration of [[general anesthesia]] and [[opioid]]s. It is sometimes given in [[hyperemesis gravidarum]], although the manufacturer advises that it be avoided in pregnancy. Off-license use often occurs with specialists in hospitals to treat inpatients who have become severely dehydrated in pregnancy. An off-label use is as an opioid/opiate potentiator.<ref name=valoid>

The drug Diconal is a combination of cyclizine and the opioid [[dipipanone]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emc.medicines.org.uk/emc/assets/c/html/DisplayDoc.asp?DocumentID=15199|title=Diconal Tablets by Amdipharm|work=Electronic Medicines Compendium|publisher=Datapharm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401052533/http://emc.medicines.org.uk/emc/assets/c/html/displaydoc.asp?documentid=15199|archivedate=2008-04-01|df=}}</ref> Dipipanone is a [[schedule I controlled substance]] in the US, due to its high abuse potential.

==Contraindications==
Its antimuscarinic action warrants caution in patients with [[Benign prostatic hyperplasia|prostatic hypertrophy]], urinary retention, or angle-closure [[glaucoma]]. Liver disease exacerbates its sedative effects.<ref name=valoid/>

==Adverse effects==
'''Common''' (over 10%) — [[Drowsiness]], [[xerostomia|dry mouth]].

'''Uncommon''' (1% to 10%) — Headache, psychomotor impairment, dermatitis, and [[antimuscarinic]] effects such as diplopia (double vision), [[tachycardia]], [[constipation]], [[urinary retention]] and gastro-intestinal disturbances.

'''Rare''' (less than 1%) — Hypersensitivity reactions ([[bronchospasm]], [[angioedema]], [[anaphylaxis]], rashes and [[photosensitivity]] reactions), [[extrapyramidal symptoms|extrapyramidal]] effects, dizziness, confusion, depression, sleep disturbances, [[tremor]], liver dysfunction, and [[hallucination]]s.

==Pharmacology==
Cyclizine is a [[piperazine]] derivative with histamine H<sub>1</sub>-receptor antagonist ([[antihistamine]]) activity. The precise mechanism of action in inhibiting the symptoms of motion sickness is not well understood. It may have effects directly on the vestibular apparatus and on the [[chemoreceptor trigger zone]]. Cyclizine exerts a central [[anticholinergic]] ([[antimuscarinic]]) action.<ref name=valoid/>

==Chemistry==
Cyclizine is a member of the [[diphenylmethylpiperazine]] group of antihistamines.

==History==
Cyclizine was developed in the American division of pharmacy company [[Burroughs Wellcome]] (today [[GlaxoSmithKline]]) during a research study involving many drugs of the antihistamine group. Cyclizine was quickly clinically found as a potent and long-acting antiemetic. The company named the substance – or more precisely cyclizine's [[hydrochloride]] form which it usually appears in – "marezine hydrochloride" and started to sell it in the United States under trade name ''Marezine''. Selling was begun in [[France]] under trade name ''Marzine'' in 1965.<ref name="discovery">

The substance received more credit when [[NASA]] chose it as a space antiemetic for the [[Apollo 11|first occupied moon flight]]. Cyclizine was introduced to many countries as a common antiemetic. It is an over-the-counter drug in many countries because it has been well tolerated, although it has not been studied much.<ref name="discovery" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drugs.smd.qmul.ac.uk/drugs/html5/Anti-emetics/AN-FEF54A37-6289-402B-E208-9284E183608A.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402111754/http://www.drugs.smd.qmul.ac.uk/drugs/html5/Anti-emetics/AN-FEF54A37-6289-402B-E208-9284E183608A.html |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}</ref>

Some people using methadone recreationally combine cyclizine with their methadone dose, a combination that is known to produce strong [[psychoactive]] effects.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1   = Ruben    | first1 = S.
