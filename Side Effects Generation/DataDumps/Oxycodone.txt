'''Oxycodone''' is a [[semisynthesis|semisynthetic]] [[opioid]] synthesized from [[thebaine]], an opioid [[alkaloid]] found in the [[Papaver bracteatum|Persian poppy]], and one of the many alkaloids found in the [[Papaver somniferum|opium poppy]]. It is a moderately potent opioid [[analgesic]], generally indicated for relief of moderate to severe pain.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Drewes |first=Asbjørn M |last2=Jensen |first2=Rasmus D |last3=Nielsen |first3=Lecia M |last4=Droney |first4=Joanne |last5=Christrup |first5=Lona L |last6=Arendt-Nielsen |first6=Lars |last7=Riley  |first7=Julia |last8=Dahan |first8=Albert |date=2013 |title=Differences between opioids: pharmacological, experimental, clinical and economical perspectives |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3555047/pdf/bcp0075-0060.pdf |format=PDF |journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume=75 |issue=1 |pages=60–78 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.2012.04317.x |issn=0306-5251 |pmc=3555047 |pmid=22554450}}</ref> Oxycodone was developed in 1917 in Germany<ref>German (DE) Patent 296916</ref><ref name="Oxysynthesis"/> as one of several semi-synthetic opioids in an attempt to improve on the existing opioids.<ref name="Kalso">{{cite journal |author = Kalso E |title = Oxycodone |journal = Journal of Pain and Symptom Management |volume = 29 |issue = 5S |pages = S47–S56 |year = 2005 |pmid = 15907646 |doi = 10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2005.01.010}}</ref>

Oxycodone is available as single-ingredient medication in immediate release and controlled release. Parenteral formulations of 10&nbsp;mg/mL and 50&nbsp;mg/mL are available in the UK for IV/IM administration.<ref>{{cite web |title=eMC |url=http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/searchresults.aspx?term=Oxycodone&searchtype=QuickSearch |publisher=eMC |accessdate=1 July 2014}}</ref> Combination products are also available as immediate-release formulations, with non-narcotic analgesic ingredients such as [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) and [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs), including [[aspirin]] and [[ibuprofen]]. 

As it has euphoric effects similar to other [[opioid]]s, oxycodone is one of the drugs abused in the current [[opioid epidemic]] in the United States.<ref>[http://www.sent-trib.com/news/front_page/adamhs-associate-director-opiate-epidemic-prevalent-everywhere/article_b16bdc9d-a7dd-5575-a71d-15c0a9beaf14.html]</ref><ref>[http://www.raps.org/Regulatory-Focus/News/2017/06/13/27895/FDA-to-Take-Closer-Look-at-Abuse-Deterrent-Opioids/]</ref> An abuse-deterrent [[oxycodone/naloxone|combination with naloxone]] is available in managed-release tablets.

In the U.S., extended-release oxycodone is approved for use in children as young as 11 years old. The approved indication is for relief of cancer pain, trauma pain, or pain due to major surgery, in children already treated with opioids, who can tolerate at least 20&nbsp;mg per day of oxycodone; this provides an alternative to Duragesic (fentanyl) the only other extended-release [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] approved for children.<ref>[http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/fda-approves-oxycontin-for-kids-11-to-16/ar-BBlK3zS?ocid=spartandhp msn.com]</ref>

===Administration===
In the United States, oxycodone is only approved for oral use, available as tablets and oral solutions. In Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, oxycodone is also approved for [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] (IV) and [[Intramuscular injection|intramuscular]] (IM) use. When first introduced in Germany during World War I, both IV and IM administrations of oxycodone were commonly used for postoperative pain management of [[Central Powers]] soldiers.<ref name="Kalso"/>

Serious side effects of oxycodone include reduced sensitivity to pain (beyond the pain the drug is taken to reduce), [[euphoria]], [[anxiolysis]], feelings of [[relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]], and [[respiratory depression]].<ref name="FitzgibbonLoeser2012" /> Common side effects of oxycodone include [[constipation]] (23%), [[nausea]] (23%), [[vomiting]] (12%), [[somnolence]] (23%), [[dizziness]] (13%), [[pruritus|itching]] (13%), [[dry mouth]] (6%), and [[sweating]] (5%).<ref name="FitzgibbonLoeser2012" /><ref name=drugscomSE>{{cite web |title=Oxycodone Side Effects |url=http://www.drugs.com/sfx/oxycodone-side-effects.html |publisher=Drugs.com|accessdate=22 May 2013}}</ref> Less common side effects (experienced by less than 5% of patients) include [[anorexia (symptom)|loss of appetite]], [[anxiety|nervousness]], [[abdominal pain]], [[diarrhea]], [[urinary retention|urine retention]], [[dyspnea]], and [[hiccups]].<ref name="OxyContinInsertUS" />

In high doses, [[overdose]]s, or in some persons not tolerant to opioids, oxycodone can cause [[shallow breathing]], [[bradycardia|slowed heart rate]], cold/clammy skin, [[apnea|pauses in breathing]], [[hypotension|low blood pressure]], [[miosis|constricted pupils]], [[circulatory collapse]], [[respiratory arrest]], and [[death]].<ref name="OxyContinInsertUS" />

Oxycodone overdose has also been described to cause spinal cord infarction in high doses and ischemic damage to the brain, due to prolonged hypoxia from suppressed breathing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314274959_Clinical_Reasoning_A_young_woman_with_respiratory_failure_hearing_loss_and_paraplegia|title=Clinical Reasoning: A young woman with respiratory failure, hearing loss, and paraplegia|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-03-09}}</ref>

===Dependence, addiction, and withdrawal===
{{main article|Opioid dependence}}
The risk of experiencing severe [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms is high if a patient has become physically dependent and discontinues oxycodone abruptly. Medically, when the drug has been taken regularly over an extended period, it is withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. People who regularly use oxycodone recreationally or at higher than prescribed doses are at even higher risk of severe withdrawal symptoms. The symptoms of oxycodone withdrawal, as with other opioids, may include "[[anxiety]], [[panic attack]], [[nausea]], [[insomnia]], [[muscle pain]], [[muscle weakness]], [[fever]]s, and other [[Flu-like syndrome|flu-like symptoms]]".<ref name="CESAR2005">{{cite web |url=http://www.cesar.umd.edu/cesar/drugs/oxycodone.asp |title=Oxycodone |accessdate=2009-03-25 |date=2005-05-02 |publisher=Center for Substance Abuse Research}}</ref>

Withdrawal symptoms have also been reported in newborns whose mothers had been either injecting or orally taking oxycodone during pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rao R, Desai NS |title = OxyContin and neonatal abstinence syndrome |journal = J Perinatol |volume = 22 |issue = 4 |pages = 324–5 |date = June 2002 |pmid = 12032797 |doi = 10.1038/sj.jp.7210744 |url = http://www.nature.com/jp/journal/v22/n4/pdf/7210744a.pdf |format = PDF |accessdate = 2009-03-25 }}</ref>

===Hormone imbalance===
{{Main article|Opioid#Hormone imbalance}}
As with other opioids, chronic use of oxycodone (particularly with higher doses) often causes concurrent [[hypogonadism]] or [[hormone imbalance]].<ref>{{cite journal |author = Brennan MJ |title = The effect of opioid therapy on endocrine function |journal = The American Journal of Medicine |volume = 126 |issue = 3 Suppl 1 |pages = S12-8 |year = 2013 |pmid = 23414717 |doi = 10.1016/j.amjmed.2012.12.001 }}</ref>

==Interactions==
Oxycodone is [[metabolized]] by the [[enzyme]]s [[CYP3A4]] and [[CYP2D6]], and its clearance therefore can be altered by [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]]s and [[enzyme inducer|inducer]]s of these enzymes.<ref name="Forbes2007" /> (For lists of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors and inducers, see [[CYP3A4#CYP3A4 ligands|here]] and [[CYP2D6#Ligands|here]], respectively.) Natural [[genetic variation]] in these enzymes can also influence the clearance of oxycodone, which may be related to the wide inter-individual variability in its [[half-life]] and [[potency (pharmacology)|potency]].<ref name="Forbes2007" />

[[Ritonavir]] or [[lopinavir/ritonavir]] greatly increase plasma concentrations of oxycodone in healthy human volunteers due to inhibition of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6.<ref name="NieminenHagelberg2010">{{cite journal|last1=Nieminen|first1=Tuija H. |last2=Hagelberg |first2=Nora M.|last3=Saari|first3=Teijo I. |last4=Neuvonen |first4=Mikko |last5=Neuvonen |first5=Pertti J. |last6=Laine |first6=Kari |last7=Olkkola |first7=Klaus T. |title=Oxycodone concentrations are greatly increased by the concomitant use of ritonavir or lopinavir/ritonavir |journal=European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume=66|issue=10|year=2010|pages=977–985|issn=0031-6970 |doi=10.1007/s00228-010-0879-1}}</ref> [[Rifampicin]] greatly reduces plasma concentrations of oxycodone due to strong induction of CYP3A4.<ref name="NieminenHagelberg2009">{{cite journal |last1=Nieminen |first1=Tuija H. |last2=Hagelberg |first2=Nora M. |last3=Saari |first3=Teijo I. |last4=Pertovaara |first4=Antti|last5=Neuvonen |first5=Mikko |last6=Laine |first6=Kari |last7=Neuvonen |first7=Pertti J.|last8=Olkkola |first8=Klaus T. |title=Rifampin Greatly Reduces the Plasma Concentrations of Intravenous and Oral Oxycodone |journal=Anesthesiology |volume=110 |issue=6 |year=2009 |pages=1371–1378 |issn=0003-3022 |doi=10.1097/ALN.0b013e31819faa54 |pmid=19417618}}</ref> There is also a case report of [[fosphenytoin]], a CYP3A4 inducer, dramatically reducing the analgesic effects of oxycodone in a chronic pain patient.<ref name="Pon, PharmDHwang, PharmD Candidate2015">{{cite journal |last1=Pon, PharmD |first1=Doreen |last2=Hwang, PharmD Candidate |first2=Joon|last3=Lo, PharmD Candidate |first3=Teresa |last4=Van Zyl, MD, FACEP |first4=Carin |title=Case study.

Oxycodone is a highly selective [[full agonist]] of the [[mu Opioid receptor|μ-opioid receptor]] (MOR), with low [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for the [[delta Opioid receptor|δ-opioid receptor]] (DOR) and [[kappa Opioid receptor|κ-opioid receptor]] (KOR).<ref name="Davis2009" /><ref name="Forbes2007" /> After oxycodone binds to the MOR, a [[G protein]]-complex is released, which inhibits the release of [[neurotransmitter]]s by the cell by reducing the amount of [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] produced, closing [[calcium channel]]s, and opening [[potassium channel]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author = Chahl L |year = 1996 |title = Opioids- mechanism of action |url = |journal = Aust Prescr |volume = 19 |issue = |pages = 63–65 |doi=10.18773/austprescr.1996.063}}</ref>

Similarly to most other opioids, oxycodone increases [[prolactin]] secretion, but its influence on [[testosterone]] levels is unknown.<ref name="Davis2009" /> Unlike [[morphine]], oxycodone lacks [[immunosuppressive]] activity (measured by natural killer cell activity and [[interleukin 2]] production ''[[in vitro]]''); the clinical relevance of this has not been clarified.<ref name="Davis2009" />

===Controversy===
In 1997, a group of Australian researchers proposed (based on a study in rats) that oxycodone acts on KORs, unlike morphine, which acts upon MORs.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ross FB, Smith MT |title = The intrinsic antinociceptive effects of oxycodone appear to be κ-opioid receptor mediated |journal = Pain |volume = 73 |issue = 2 |pages = 151–157 |year = 1997 |pmid = 9415500 |doi = 10.1016/S0304-3959(97)00093-6 }}</ref> Further research by this group indicated the drug appears to be a κ<sub>2b</sub>-opioid agonist.<ref>{{cite journal |author = Smith MT |title = Differences between and combinations of opioids re-visited |journal = Curr Opin Anaesthesiol |volume = 21 |issue = 5 |pages = 596–601 |year = 2008 |pmid = 18784485 |doi = 10.1097/ACO.0b013e32830a4c4a }}</ref> However, this conclusion has been disputed, primarily on the basis that oxycodone produces effects that are typical of μ-opioid agonists.<ref name="pmid17961923">{{cite journal |author = Kalso E |title = How different is oxycodone from morphine? |journal = Pain |volume = 132 |issue = 3 |pages = 227–228 |year = 2007 |pmid = 17961923 |doi = 10.1016/j.pain.2007.09.027 }}</ref>

In 2006, research by a Japanese group suggested the effect of oxycodone is mediated by different receptors in different situations. Specifically in diabetic mice, the κ-opioid receptor appears to be involved in the antinociceptive effects of oxycodone,<ref name="pmid16533506">{{cite journal |vauthors=Nozaki C, Saitoh A, Kamei J |title = Characterization of the antinociceptive effects of oxycodone in diabetic mice |journal = Eur.

==Pharmacokinetics==

===Absorption===
After a dose of conventional (instant-release) oral oxycodone, the [[onset of action]] is 10–30 minutes,<ref name="ElliottSmith2016" /><ref name="SmithPassik2008" /> and peak plasma levels of the drug are attained within roughly 30–60 minutes;<ref name="ElliottSmith2016" /><ref name="SmithPassik2008" /><ref name="LalovicKharasch2006" /> in contrast, after a dose of OxyContin (an oral controlled-release formulation), peak plasma levels of oxycodone occur in about three hours.<ref name="OxyContinInsertUS">{{cite book|title=1.

===Distribution===
Oxycodone in the blood is distributed to skeletal muscle, liver, intestinal tract, lungs, spleen, and brain.<ref name="OxyContinInsertUS" /> Conventional oral preparations start to reduce pain within 10–15 minutes on an empty stomach; in contrast, OxyContin starts to reduce pain within one hour.<ref name="AHFS" />

===Metabolism===
The [[metabolism]] of oxycodone in humans is extensive (about 95%) and complex, with many minor [[metabolic pathway|pathway]]s and resulting [[metabolite]]s.<ref name="SmithPassik2008">{{cite book |author1=Howard Smith |author2=Steven Passik |title=Pain and Chemical Dependency |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T88C-9VTDXMC&pg=PA195 |date=25 April 2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=978-0-19-530055-0 |pages=195–}}</ref><ref name="pmid14516487">{{cite journal |vauthors=Moore KA, Ramcharitar V, Levine B, Fowler D |title = Tentative identification of novel oxycodone metabolites in human urine |journal = J Anal Toxicol |volume = 27 |issue = 6 |pages = 346–52 |date = September 2003 |pmid = 14516487 |doi = 10.1093/jat/27.6.346 }}</ref> Around 10% (range 8–14%) of a dose of oxycodone is excreted essentially unchanged (unconjugated or [[conjugation (biochemistry)|conjugated]]) in the [[urine]].<ref name="SmithPassik2008" /> The major metabolites of oxycodone are [[noroxycodone]] (70%), [[noroxymorphone]] ("relatively high concentrations"),<ref name="FitzgibbonLoeser2012">{{cite book|author1=Dermot R.

* N-[[demethylation]] to [[noroxycodone]] predominantly via [[CYP3A4]]
* O-demethylation to [[oxymorphone]] predominantly via [[CYP2D6]]
* 6-[[wikt:ketoreduction|ketoreduction]] to [[6α-oxycodol|6α-]] and [[6β-oxycodol]]
* N-[[oxidation]] to [[oxycodone-N-oxide]]

In humans, N-demethylation of oxycodone to noroxycodone by CYP3A4 is the major metabolic pathway, accounting for 45% ± 21% of a dose of oxycodone, while O-demethylation of oxycodone into oxymorphone by CYP2D6 and 6-ketoreduction of oxycodone into 6-oxycodols represent relatively minor metabolic pathways, accounting for 11% ± 6% and 8% ± 6% of a dose of oxycodone, respectively.<ref name="SmithPassik2008" /><ref name="Davis2009" />

Several of the immediate [[metabolite]]s of oxycodone are subsequently conjugated with [[glucuronic acid]] and excreted in the [[urine]].<ref name="SmithPassik2008" /> 6α-Oxycodol and 6β-oxycodol are further metabolized by N-demethylation to [[nor-6α-oxycodol]] and [[nor-6β-oxycodol]], respectively, and by N-oxidation to [[6α-oxycodol-N-oxide]] and [[6β-oxycodol-N-oxide]] (which can subsequently be [[glucuronidation|glucuronidated]] as well), respectivelyrespectively.<ref name="SmithPassik2008" /><ref name="McPhersonPincus2016" /> Oxymorphone is also further metabolized, as follows:<ref name="SmithPassik2008" /><ref name="McPhersonPincus2016" /><ref name="AnzenbacherZanger2012" />

* 3-glucuronidation to [[oxymorphone-3-glucuronide]] predominantly via [[UGT2B7]]
* 6-ketoreduction to [[oxymorphol|6α-oxymorphol]] and [[oxymorphol|6β-oxymorphol]]
* N-demethylation to [[noroxymorphone]]

The first pathway of the above three accounts for 40% of the metabolism of oxymorphone, making oxymorphone-3-glucuronide the main metabolite of oxymorphone, while the latter two pathways account for less than 10% of the metabolism of oxymorphone.<ref name="AnzenbacherZanger2012" /> After N-demethylation of oxymorphone, [[noroxymorphone]] is further glucuronidated to [[noroxymorphone-3-glucuronide]].<ref name="AnzenbacherZanger2012" />

====Activity contribution of metabolites====
A few of the metabolites of oxycodone have also been found to be active as MOR agonists, some of which notably have much higher [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for (as well as higher [[intrinsic activity|efficacy]] at) the MOR in comparison.<ref name="LalovicKharasch2006">{{cite journal |last1=Lalovic |first1=B |last2=Kharasch |first2=E |last3=Hoffer|first3=C |last4=Risler |first4=L |last5=Liuchen |first5=L|last6=Shen|first6=D|title=Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral oxycodone in healthy human subjects: Role of circulating active metabolites |journal=Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics |volume=79 |issue=5 |year=2006 |pages=461–479 |issn=0009-9236 |doi=10.1016/j.clpt.2006.01.009 |pmid=16678548}}</ref><ref name="KlimasWitticke2013">{{cite journal |last1=Klimas |first1=Romina |last2=Witticke |first2=Diana |last3=El Fallah |first3=Sarah |last4=Mikus |first4=Gerd |title=Contribution of oxycodone and its metabolites to the overall analgesic effect after oxycodone administration |journal=Expert Opinion on Drug Metabolism & Toxicology |volume=9 |issue=5 |year=2013 |pages=517–528 |issn=1742-5255 |doi=10.1517/17425255.2013.779669}}</ref><ref name="LembergSiiskonen2008">{{cite journal |last1=Lemberg |first1=Kim K. |last2=Siiskonen |first2=Antti O. |last3=Kontinen|first3=Vesa K.|last4=Yli-Kauhaluoma|first4=Jari T. |last5=Kalso|first5=Eija A. |title=Pharmacological Characterization of Noroxymorphone as a New Opioid for Spinal Analgesia |journal=Anesthesia & Analgesia |volume=106 |issue=2 |year=2008 |pages=463–470 |issn=0003-2999 |doi=10.1213/ane.0b013e3181605a15 |pmid=18227301}}</ref> Oxymorphone possesses 3- to 5-fold higher affinity for the MOR than does oxycodone,<ref name="SmithPassik2008" /> while noroxycodone and noroxymorphone possess one-third of and 3-fold higher affinity for the MOR, respectively,<ref name="SmithPassik2008">{{cite book |author1=Howard Smith |author2=Steven Passik |title=Pain and Chemical Dependency |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T88C-9VTDXMC&pg=PA195 |date=25 April 2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=978-0-19-530055-0 |pages=195–}}</ref><ref name="LembergSiiskonen2008" /> and MOR activation is 5- to 10-fold less with noroxycodone but 2-fold higher with noroxymorphone relative to oxycodone.<ref name="Preedy2016" /> Noroxycodone, noroxymorphone, and oxymorphone also have longer [[half-life|half-live]]s than oxycodone.<ref name="LalovicKharasch2006" /><ref name="FiresteinBudd2016">{{cite book |last1=Firestein |first1=Gary S. |last2=Budd |first2=Ralph C. |last3=Gabriel |first3=Sherine E. |last4=McInnes |first4=Iain B. |last5=O'Dell |first5=James R. |title=Kelley and Firestein's Textbook of Rheumatology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kBZ6DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA1080 |date=21 June 2016 |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=978-0-323-31696-5 |lccn=2016009254 |pages=1080–}}</ref>

However, despite the greater ''[[in vitro]]'' activity of some of its metabolites, it has been determined that oxycodone itself is responsible for 83.0% and 94.8% of its analgesic effect following [[oral administration|oral]] and [[intravenous administration]], respectively.<ref name="KlimasWitticke2013" /> Oxymorphone plays only a minor role, being responsible for 15.8% and 4.5% of the analgesic effect of oxycodone after oral and intravenous administration, respectively.<ref name="KlimasWitticke2013" /> Although the CYP2D6 [[genotype]] and the [[route of administration]] result in differential rates of oxymorphone formation, the unchanged parent compound remains the major contributor to the overall analgesic effect of oxycodone.<ref name="KlimasWitticke2013" /> In contrast to oxycodone and oxymorphone, noroxycodone and noroxymorphone, while also potent MOR agonists, poorly cross the [[blood-brain-barrier]] into the [[central nervous system]], and for this reason, are only minimally analgesic in comparison.<ref name="LalovicKharasch2006" /><ref name="Preedy2016" /><ref name="KlimasWitticke2013" /><ref name="LembergSiiskonen2008" /> In accordance, while higher CYP2D6 activity increases the effects of oxycodone (owing to increased conversion into oxymorphone), higher CYP3A4 activity has the opposite effect, and decreases the effects of oxycodone (owing to increased metabolism into noroxycodone and noroxymorphone).<ref name="SamerDaali2010">{{cite journal |last1=Samer |first1=CF |last2=Daali |first2=Y |last3=Wagner |first3=M |last4=Hopfgartner |first4=G|last5=Eap |first5=CB |last6=Rebsamen |first6=MC |last7=Rossier |first7=MF |last8=Hochstrasser |first8=D |last9=Dayer |first9=P |last10=Desmeules |first10=JA |title=Genetic polymorphisms and drug interactions modulating CYP2D6 and CYP3A activities have a major effect on oxycodone analgesic efficacy and safety |journal=British Journal of Pharmacology |volume=160 |issue=4 |year=2010 |pages=919–930 |issn=0007-1188 |doi=10.1111/j.1476-5381.2010.00709.x |pmid=20590588 |pmc=2935998}}</ref>

====Variation====
Oxycodone is metabolized by the [[cytochrome P450]] enzyme system in the liver, making it vulnerable to drug interactions.<ref name="OxyContinInsertUS" /> Some people are fast metabolizers, resulting in reduced analgesic effect, but increased adverse effects, while others are slow metabolisers, resulting in increased toxicity without improved analgesia.<ref name="pmid15625333">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gasche Y, Daali Y, Fathi M, Chiappe A, Cottini S, Dayer P, Desmeules J |title = Codeine intoxication associated with ultrarapid CYP2D6 metabolism  |journal = N.

===Elimination===
Oxycodone and its metabolites are mainly excreted in the urine and sweat; therefore, it accumulates in patients with [[renal|kidney]] impairment.<ref name="AHFS" />

===Bioavailability===
Oxycodone can be administered orally, intranasally, via [[intravenous]], [[intramuscular]], or [[subcutaneous injection]], or [[suppository|rectally]]. The [[bioavailability]] of oral administration of oxycodone averages 60–87%, with rectal administration yielding the same results; intranasal varies between individuals with a mean of 46%.<ref>Analgesic Expert Group.

==Chemistry==
Oxycodone's chemical name is derived from [[codeine]]. The chemical structures are very similar, differing only in that
* Oxycodone has a [[hydroxy group]] at carbon-14 (codeine has just a hydrogen in its place)
* Oxycodone has a 7,8-dihydro feature. Codeine has a [[double bond]] between those two carbons; and
* Oxycodone has a [[carbonyl group]] (as in [[ketone]]s) in place of the hydroxyl group of codeine. 
It is also similar to [[hydrocodone]], differing only in that it has a hydroxyl group at carbon-14.<ref name=AHFS/>

Oxycodone is marketed as various salts, most commonly as the hydrochloride salt. The [[free base]] conversion ratios of different salts are: hydrochloride (0.896), bitartrate (0.667), tartrate (0.750), camphosulphonate (0.576), pectinate (0.588), phenylpriopionate (0.678), sulphate (0.887), phosphate (0.763), and terephthalate (0.792). The hydrochloride salt is the basis of most American oxycodone products whilst bitartrate, tartrate, pectinate, terephthalate and phosphate salts are also available in European products. Methyiodide and hydroiodide are mentioned in older European publications.

===Biosynthesis===
In terms of biosynthesis, oxycodone has been found naturally in nectar extracts from the orchid family ''[[Epipactis helleborine]]''; together along with another opioid: 3-<nowiki/>{2-<nowiki/>{3-<nowiki/>{3-benzyloxypropyl}-3-indol, 7,8-didehydro- 4,5-epoxy-3,6-d-morphinan.<ref>[https://www.erowid.org/references/texts/show/8710docid7639 "Why do pollinators become 'sluggish'?

Jakubska A, Przado D, Steininger M, Aniol-Kwiatkowska A, Kadej M.</ref>

===Detection in biological fluids===
Oxycodone and/or its major metabolites may be measured in blood or urine to monitor for [[Clearance (medicine)|clearance]], abuse, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Many commercial opiate screening tests cross-react appreciably with oxycodone and its metabolites, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish oxycodone from other opiates.<ref>Baselt, R.

==History==
Freund and Speyer of the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]] in Germany first synthesized oxycodone from Thebaine in 1916,<ref name="Oxysynthesis">{{cite book|author=Sneader W|title=Drug discovery: a history |publisher=Wiley |year=2005 |location=Hoboken, NJ |page=119 |isbn=0-471-89980-1}}</ref> a few years after the German pharmaceutical company [[Bayer]] had stopped the mass production of [[heroin]] due to hazardous use, harmful use, and dependence. It was hoped that a [[thebaine]]-derived drug would retain the analgesic effects of morphine and heroin with less dependence. Unfortunately, this was ultimately not found to be the case.

The first clinical use of the drug was documented in 1917, the year after it was first developed.<ref name="Oxysynthesis"/><ref name="Sunshine">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sunshine A, Olson NZ, Colon A, Rivera J, Kaiko RF, Fitzmartin RD, Reder RF, Goldenheim PD |title = Analgesic efficacy of controlled-release oxycodone in postoperative pain |journal = J Clin Pharmacol |volume = 36 |issue = 7 |pages = 595–603 |date = July 1996 |pmid = 8844441 |doi = 10.1002/j.1552-4604.1996.tb04223.x |url = http://jcp.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/36/7/59 }}</ref> It was first introduced to the US market in May 1939. In early 1928, Merck introduced a combination product containing [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]], oxycodone, and [[ephedrine]] under the German initials for the ingredients '''SEE''', which was later renamed '''Scophedal''' (SCOpolamine ePHEDrine and eukodAL). This combination is essentially an oxycodone analogue of the morphine-based ´[[twilight sleep]]´, with ephedrine added to reduce circulatory and respiratory effects.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The personal notes of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s physician, Dr. [[Theodor Morell]], indicate Hitler received repeated injections of "eukodal" (oxycodone).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dw.com/en/a-fresh-light-on-the-nazis-wartime-drug-addiction/a-18703678 |title=A fresh light on the Nazis' wartime drug addiction |last=Breitenbach |first=Dagmar |date=9 September 2015 |website=Deutsche Welle |access-date=2016-04-24}}</ref>

In the early 1970s, the United States government classified oxycodone as a schedule II drug.

===Legal status===

====General====
Oxycodone is subject to international conventions on narcotic drugs. In addition, oxycodone is subject to national laws that differ by country. The 1931 [[Convention for Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs]] of the [[League of Nations]] included oxycodone.<ref>{{cite web|author=League of Nations|title=Convention for limiting the manufacture and regulating the distribution of narcotic drugs |year=1931 |url=http://treaties.un.org/doc/Treaties/1931/07/19310713%2006-44%20AM/Ch_VI_8_ap.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-04-04}}</ref> The 1961 [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] of the [[United Nations]], which replaced the 1931 convention, categorized oxycodone in Schedule I.<ref name="SingleConvention">{{cite web|title=United Nations conference for the adoption of a single convention on narcotic drugs.

====Australia====
Oxycodone is in Schedule I (derived from the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs) of the Commonwealth's Narcotic Drugs Act 1967.<ref>{{cite web|author=Commonwealth of Australia |title=Narcotic Drugs Act 1967 – first schedule|publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nda1967160/sch1.html |accessdate=2009-04-06}}</ref> In addition, it is in Schedule 8 of the Australian Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Drugs and Poisons ("Poisons Standard"), meaning it is a "controlled drug... which should be available for use but require[s] restriction of manufacture, supply, distribution, possession and use to reduce abuse, misuse and physical or psychological dependence".<ref>{{cite book|author=Australian Government. Department of Health and Aging. Therapeutic Goods Administration|title=Standard for the uniform scheduling of drugs and poisons no. 23 |url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/ComLaw/Legislation/LegislativeInstrument1.nsf/0/3BBB39C4645284BCCA2574A6001C711F/$file/PoisonsStandard2008.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |location=Canberra |isbn=1-74186-596-4 |date=June 2008 |accessdate=2009-04-06}}</ref>

====Canada====
Oxycodone is a controlled substance under Schedule I of the [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act]] (CDSA).<ref name="CanadaCDSA">{{cite web|last=Canada Department of Justice |title=Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (1996, c. 19) |date=2009-02-27 |url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowFullDoc/cs/C-38.8///en |accessdate=2009-03-23}}</ref>

=====Canadian legislative changes=====
In February 2012, Ontario passed legislation to allow the expansion of an already existing drug-tracking system for publicly funded drugs to include those that are privately insured. This database will function to identify and monitor patient’s attempts to seek prescriptions from multiple doctors or retrieve from multiple pharmacies. Other provinces have proposed similar legislation, while some, such as Nova Scotia, have legislation already in effect for monitoring prescription drug use. These changes have coincided with other changes in Ontario’s legislation to target the misuse of painkillers and high addiction rates to drugs such as oxycodone. As of February 29, 2012, Ontario passed legislation delisting oxycodone from the province’s public drug benefit program. This was a first for any province to delist a drug based on addictive properties. The new law prohibits prescriptions for OxyNeo except to certain patients under the Exceptional Access Program including palliative care and in other extenuating circumstances. Patients already prescribed oxycodone will receive coverage for an additional year for OxyNeo, and after that, it will be disallowed unless designated under the exceptional access program.<ref>Olgilvie, Megan. [https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/1133247--ontario-to-delist-oxycontin-and-its-substitute-from-drug-benefit-program "Ontario delisting OxyContin and its substitute from drug benefit program"] Toronto Star (2012-02-17)</ref>

Much of the legislative activity has stemmed from Purdue Pharma’s decision in 2011 to begin a modification of Oxycontin’s composition to make it more difficult to crush for snorting or injecting. The new formulation, OxyNeo, is intended to be preventative in this regard and retain its effectiveness as a painkiller. Since introducing its ''Narcotics Safety and Awareness Act'', Ontario has committed to focusing on drug addiction, particularly in the monitoring and identification of problem opioid prescriptions, as well as the education of patients, doctors, and pharmacists.<ref>[http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/public/programs/drugs/ons/ons_legislation.aspx Narcotics Safety and Awareness Act]. 2010.

Because laws are largely provincially regulated, many speculate a national strategy is needed to prevent smuggling across provincial borders from jurisdictions with looser restrictions.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/02/20/ontario-oxycontin-rules-national-regulations_n_1288375.html Ontario OxyContin Rules: New Restrictions Applauded But National Rules Needed]. Huffington Post. Canadian Press (2012-02-20)</ref>

In 2015, Purdue Pharma's abuse-resistant OxyNEO and six generic versions of OxyContin had been on the Canada-wide approved list for prescriptions since 2012. In June 2015, then federal Minister of Health Rona Ambrose announced that within three years all oxycodone products sold in Canada would need to be tamper-resistant. Some experts warned that the generic product manufacturers may not have the technology to achieve that goal, possibly giving Purdue Pharma a monopoly on this opiate.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Weeks |first1=Carly |last2=Howlett |first2=Karen |date=August 4, 2015 |title=New oxycodone rules would give drug maker a monopoly in Canada, experts warn |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/new-oxycodone-rules-would-give-drug-maker-a-monoply-in-canada-experts-warn/article25820214/|newspaper=Globe and Mail |location=Toronto, Ontario |access-date=December 15, 2015}}</ref>

=====Canadian lawsuits=====
Several class action suits across Canada have been launched against the Purdue group of companies and affiliates. Claimants argue the pharmaceutical manufacturers did not meet a standard of care and were negligent in doing so. These lawsuits reference earlier judgments in the United States, which held that Purdue was liable for wrongful marketing practices and misbranding. Since 2007, the Purdue companies have paid over CAN$650 million in settling litigation or facing criminal fines.<!-- <ref>Martin, Kevin.

====Japan====
Oxycodone is a restricted drug in Japan. Its import and export is strictly restricted to specially designated organizations having prior permit to import it. In a high-profile case an American who was a top Toyota executive living in Tokyo, who claimed to be unaware of the law, was arrested for importing oxycodone into Japan.<ref>[http://www.japantoday.com/category/crime/view/toyotas-american-pr-chief-arrested-on-suspected-drug-violation Toyota's American PR chief arrested for suspected drug violation]</ref><ref>[http://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/toyota-american-exec-did-not-intend-to-break-japan-law/ar-AAbP7OC Toyota: American exec did not intend to break Japan law]</ref>

====Singapore====
Oxycodone is listed as a Class A drug in the [[Misuse of Drugs Act (Singapore)|Misuse of Drugs Act]] of [[Singapore]], which means offences in relation to the drug attract the most severe level of punishment. A conviction for unauthorized manufacture of the drug attracts a [[mandatory sentencing|minimum sentence]] of 10 years of imprisonment and [[caning in Singapore|corporal punishment]] of 5 strokes of the cane, and a maximum sentence of life imprisonment or 30 years of imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.<ref>{{Singapore legislation|title=Misuse of Drugs Act|cap=185|ed=2008}} (Singapore), section 6(1).</ref> The minimum and maximum penalties for unauthorized trafficking in the drug are respectively 5 years of imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane, and 20 years of imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.<ref>Misuse of Drugs Act (Singapore), section 5(1).</ref>
