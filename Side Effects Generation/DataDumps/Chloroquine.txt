===Malaria===

Chloroquine has long been used in the treatment or prevention of [[malaria]]  from ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]'', ''[[Plasmodium ovale|P. ovale]]'', and ''[[Plasmodium malariae|P. malariae]]''. After the malaria parasite ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' started to develop widespread resistance to it.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Plowe CV |title=Antimalarial drug resistance in Africa: strategies for monitoring and deterrence |journal=Curr.

Chloroquine has been extensively used in [[mass drug administration]]s, which may have contributed to the emergence and spread of resistance. It is recommended to check if chloroquine is still effective in the region prior to using it.<ref>{{Cite web|title = DailyMed - CHLOROQUINE- chloroquine phosphate tablet  CHLOROQUINE- chloroquine phosphate tablet, coated|url = http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=9b585ad5-ae86-4403-b83f-8d8363d43da5|website = dailymed.nlm.nih.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-04|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208164343/http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=9b585ad5-ae86-4403-b83f-8d8363d43da5|archivedate = 8 December 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref> In areas where resistance is present, other [[Antimalarial drug|antimalarials]], such as [[mefloquine]] or [[atovaquone]], may be used instead.

===Amebiasis===

In treatment of [[amoebic liver abscess]], chloroquine may be used instead of or in addition to other medications in the event of failure of improvement with [[metronidazole]] or another [[nitroimidazole]] within 5 days or intolerance to metronidazole or a nitroimidazole.<ref>{{EMedicine|article|183920|Amebic Hepatic Abscesses|treatment}}</ref>

==Overdose==
Chloroquine is very dangerous in overdose. It is rapidly absorbed from the gut. In 1961, published studies showed three children who took overdoses died within 2.5 hours of taking the drug. While the amount of the overdose was not cited, the [[therapeutic index]] for chloroquine is known to be small.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cann |first1=Howard M. |last2=Verhulst |first2=Henry L. |title=Fatal acute chloroquine poisoning in children |journal=Pediatrics |volume=27 |issue= |pages=95–102 |year=1961 |pmid=13690445 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=13690445}}</ref> Symptoms of overdose include headache, drowsiness, visual disturbances, nausea and vomiting, cardiovascular collapse, seizures, and sudden respiratory and cardiac arrest.<ref name=":1" />

== Resistance in malaria ==

Since the first documentation of ''P. falciparum'' chloroquine resistance in the 1950s, resistant strains have appeared throughout East and West Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America. The effectiveness of chloroquine against ''P. falciparum'' has declined as resistant strains of the parasite evolved. They effectively neutralize the drug via a mechanism that drains chloroquine away from the digestive vacuole. Chloroquine-resistant cells efflux chloroquine at 40 times the rate of chloroquine-sensitive cells; the related mutations trace back to transmembrane proteins of the digestive vacuole, including sets of critical mutations in the ''P. falciparum'' chloroquine resistance transporter (''PfCRT'') gene. The mutated protein, but not the wild-type transporter, transports chloroquine when expressed in ''[[Xenopus]]'' oocytes and is thought to mediate chloroquine leak from its site of action in the digestive vacuole.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martin |first1=R. E. |last2=Marchetti |first2=R. V. |last3=Cowan |first3=A. I. |last4=Howitt |first4=S.

[[Verapamil]], a Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker, has been found to restore both the chloroquine concentration ability and sensitivity to this drug. Recently, an altered chloroquine-transporter protein CG2 of the parasite has been related to chloroquine resistance, but other mechanisms of resistance also appear to be involved.<ref>Essentials of medical pharmacology fifth edition 2003, reprint 2004, published by-Jaypee Brothers Medical Publisher Ltd, 2003, KD Tripathi, pages 739,740.</ref> Research on the mechanism of chloroquine and how the parasite has acquired chloroquine resistance is still ongoing, as other mechanisms of resistance are likely.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Other agents which have been shown to reverse chloroquine resistance in malaria are [[chlorpheniramine]], [[gefitinib]], [[imatinib]], [[tariquidar]] and [[zosuquidar]].<ref name=Alcantara2013>{{cite journal |last1=Alcantara |first1=Laura M. |last2=Kim |first2=Junwon |last3=Moraes |first3=Carolina B. |last4=Franco |first4=Caio H. |last5=Franzoi |first5=Kathrin D. |last6=Lee |first6=Sukjun |last7=Freitas-Junior |first7=Lucio H. |last8=Ayong |first8=Lawrence S. |title=Chemosensitization potential of P-glycoprotein inhibitors in malaria parasites |journal=Experimental Parasitology |volume=134 |issue=2 |pages=235–43 |year=2013 |pmid=23541983 |doi=10.1016/j.exppara.2013.03.022 }}</ref>

==Pharmacology==
* Absorption: Rapid and almost completely 
* Distribution: Widely distributed into body tissues
* Protein binding: 55% 
* Metabolism: Partially hepatic to main metabolite, desethylchloroquine
* Excretion: Urine (≥50% as unchanged drug); acidification of urine increases elimination
Chloroquine has a very high [[volume of distribution]], as it diffuses into the body's [[adipose tissue]]. Chloroquine and related [[quinine]]s have been associated with cases of [[retina]]l toxicity, particularly when provided at higher doses for longer times. Accumulation of the drug may result in deposits that can lead to blurred vision and [[blindness]]. With long-term doses, routine visits to an [[ophthalmologist]] are recommended.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Chloroquine is also a lysosomotropic agent, meaning it accumulates preferentially in the [[lysosomes]] of cells in the body. The pK<sub>a</sub> for the quinoline nitrogen of chloroquine is 8.5, meaning it is about 10% deprotonated at physiological pH as calculated by the [[Henderson-Hasselbalch equation]]. This decreases to about 0.2% at a lysosomal pH of 4.6. Because the deprotonated form is more membrane-permeable than the protonated form, a quantitative "trapping" of the compound in lysosomes results. (A quantitative treatment of this phenomenon involves the pK<sub>a</sub>s of all nitrogens in the molecule; this treatment, however, suffices to show the principle.){{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The lysosomotropic character of chloroquine is believed to account for much of its antimalarial activity; the drug concentrates in the acidic food vacuole of the parasite and interferes with essential processes. Its lysosomotropic properties further allow for its use for ''in vitro'' experiments pertaining to intracellular lipid related diseases,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chen |first1=Patrick M |last2=Gombart |first2=Zoë J |last3=Chen |first3=Jeff W |title=Chloroquine treatment of ARPE-19 cells leads to lysosome dilation and intracellular lipid accumulation: possible implications of lysosomal dysfunction in macular degeneration |journal=Cell & Bioscience |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=10 |year=2011 |pmid=21711726 |pmc=3125200 |doi=10.1186/2045-3701-1-10 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kurup |first1=Pradeep |last2=Zhang |first2=Yongfang |last3=Xu |first3=Jian |last4=Venkitaramani |first4=Deepa V. |last5=Haroutunian |first5=Vahram |last6=Greengard |first6=Paul |last7=Nairn |first7=Angus C. |last8=Lombroso |first8=Paul J. |title=Aβ-Mediated NMDA Receptor Endocytosis in Alzheimer's Disease Involves Ubiquitination of the Tyrosine Phosphatase STEP<sub>61</sub>|journal=Journal of Neuroscience |volume=30 |issue=17 |pages=5948–57 |year=2010 |pmid=20427654 |pmc=2868326 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0157-10.2010 }}</ref> autophagy, and apoptosis.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kim |first1=Ella L. |last2=Wüstenberg |first2=Robin |last3=Rübsam |first3=Anne |last4=Schmitz-Salue |first4=Christoph |last5=Warnecke |first5=Gabriele |last6=Bucker |first6=Eva-Maria |last7=Pettkus |first7=Nadine |last8=Speidel |first8=Daniel |last9=Rohde |first9=Veit |last10=Schulz-Schaeffer |first10=Walter |last11=Deppert |first11=Wolfgang |last12=Giese |first12=Alf |title=Chloroquine activates the p53 pathway and induces apoptosis in human glioma cells|journal=Neuro-Oncology |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=389–400 |year=2010 |pmid=20308316 |pmc=2940600 |doi=10.1093/neuonc/nop046 }}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==

===Antimalarial===
[[File:Birefringence of malaria pigment.jpg|thumb |[[Hemozoin]] formation in ''P. falciparum'': many antimalarials are strong inhibitors of hemozoin crystal growth.]]
Inside [[red blood cell]]s, the malarial [[parasite]], which is then in its asexual [[apicomplexa life cycle stage|lifecycle]] stage, must degrade [[hemoglobin]] to acquire essential amino acids, which the parasite requires to construct its own protein and for energy metabolism. Digestion is carried out in a vacuole of the parasitic cell.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Hemoglobin is composed of a protein unit (digested by the parasite) and a heme unit (not used by the parasite). During this process, the parasite releases the toxic and soluble molecule [[heme]]. The heme moiety consists of a porphyrin ring called Fe(II)-protoporphyrin IX (FP). To avoid destruction by this molecule, the parasite biocrystallizes heme to form  [[hemozoin]], a nontoxic molecule. Hemozoin collects in the digestive vacuole as insoluble crystals.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Chloroquine enters the red blood cell, inhibiting the parasite cell and digestive vacuole by simple diffusion. Chloroquine then becomes protonated (to CQ2+), as the digestive vacuole is known to be acidic (pH 4.7); chloroquine then cannot leave by diffusion. Chloroquine caps hemozoin molecules to prevent further [[biocrystallization]] of heme, thus leading to heme buildup. Chloroquine binds to heme (or FP) to form the FP-chloroquine complex; this complex is highly toxic to the cell and disrupts membrane function. Action of the toxic FP-chloroquine and FP results in cell lysis and ultimately parasite cell autodigestion. In essence, the parasite cell drowns in its own metabolic products.<ref>{{cite journal | author =  Hempelmann E.| title = Hemozoin biocrystallization in Plasmodium falciparum and the antimalarial activity of crystallization inhibitors| journal = Parasitol Research | volume = 100 | issue = 4 | pages = 671–676 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17111179 | doi =  10.1007/s00436-006-0313-x}}</ref> Parasites that do not form hemozoin are therefore resistant to chloroquine.<ref name="Lin2015">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Lin JW, Spaccapelo R, Schwarzer E, etal | title = Replication of Plasmodium in reticulocytes can occur without hemozoin formation, resulting in chloroquine resistance. | journal = J Exp Med | date = 2015 | pmid = 25941254 | doi = 10.1084/jem.20141731 | volume=212 | pages=893–903 | pmc=4451122}}</ref>

==History==

Chloroquine was discovered in 1934 by [[Hans Andersag]] and coworkers at the [[Bayer]] laboratories, who named it "Resochin".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Krafts |first1=Kristine |last2=Hempelmann |first2=Ernst |last3=Skórska-Stania |first3=Agnieszka |title=From methylene blue to chloroquine: a brief review of the development of an antimalarial therapy |journal=Parasitology Research |volume=111 |issue=1 |pages=1–6 |year=2012 |pmid=22411634 |doi=10.1007/s00436-012-2886-x }}</ref> It was ignored for a decade because it was considered too toxic for human use. During World War II, United States government-sponsored clinical trials for antimalarial drug development showed unequivocally that chloroquine has a significant therapeutic value as an antimalarial drug. It was introduced into clinical practice in 1947 for the prophylactic treatment of malaria.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/history/index.htm#chloroquine | title = The History of Malaria, an Ancient Disease | publisher = Centers for Disease Control | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100828183012/http://www.cdc.gov//malaria//history//index.htm#chloroquine | archivedate = 28 August 2010 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>
