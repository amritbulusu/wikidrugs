'''α-Ethyltryptamine''' ('''αET''', '''AET'''), also known as '''etryptamine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]], [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]), is a [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]], [[stimulant]], and [[entactogen]]ic [[drug]] of the [[tryptamine]] class.<ref>{{cite web|title="Erowid AET (alpha-ethyltryptamine) Vault".|url=http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/aet/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=''#11, a-ET: Alpha-Ethyltryptamine; Indole,3-(2-Aminobutyl); Tryptamine,Alpha-Ethyl; 3-(2-Aminobutyl)Indole; Monase,''|url=http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal11.shtml|work=[[TiHKAL|"Tryptamines i Have Known And Loved: The Continuation"]], Part 2, "The Chemistry Continues".|publisher=Erowid Online Library.|accessdate=15 November 2013|author=[[Alexander Shulgin]]|author2=[[Ann Shulgin]] |page=11}}</ref> It was originally developed and marketed as an [[antidepressant]] under the brand name '''Monase''' by [[Upjohn]] in the 1960s.<ref>{{ cite patent | country = US | number = 3296072 | status = Patent | title = ''Method of Treating Mental Depression'' | pubdate = 1967-01-03 | gdate =  | fdate = 1964-01-29 | pridate = 1962-06-11 | inventor = Szmuszkovicz Jacob | invent1 =  | invent2 =  | assign1 = Upjohn Co | assign2 =  | class =  | url=http://www.google.com/patents/US3296072}}</ref>
 
== History ==
Originally believed to exert its effects predominantly via [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor|monoamine oxidase inhibition]], alpha-ethyltryptamine was [[drug development|developed]] during the 1960s as an [[antidepressant]] by [[Upjohn|Upjohn chemical company]] in the [[United States]] under the name '''Monase''', but was withdrawn from potential commercial use due to incidence of [[idiosyncratic drug reaction|idiosyncratic]] [[agranulocytosis]].<ref name="tihkalbook"/>

α-ET gained limited recreational popularity as a [[designer drug]] in the 1980s. Subsequently, in the [[United States|USA]] it was added to the [[Controlled Substances Act|Schedule I]] list of [[illegal substance]]s in 1993.

== Pharmacology ==
αET is [[chemical structure|structurally]] and [[pharmacology|pharmacologically]] related to αMT, [[alpha-Methyltryptamine|α-methyltryptamine]], and it is believed<ref name="tihkalbook"/> its central stimulant activity is probably not due to its activity as an [[MAOI]], but appears to stem from its structural relationship to the [[indole|indolic]] psychedelics. In contrast to αMT, αET is less [[stimulant|stimulating]] and [[psychedelic drug|hallucinogenic]], its effects resembling more those of [[entactogen]]s like [[methylenedioxymethamphetamine|MDMA]] ("Ecstasy").

Similarly to α-MT, α-ET is a [[releasing agent]] of [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]], with [[serotonin]] being the primary [[neurotransmitter]] affected.<ref name="BloughLandavazo2014">{{cite journal|last1=Blough|first1=Bruce E.|last2=Landavazo|first2=Antonio|last3=Partilla|first3=John S.|last4=Decker|first4=Ann M.|last5=Page|first5=Kevin M.|last6=Baumann|first6=Michael H.|last7=Rothman|first7=Richard B.|title=Alpha-ethyltryptamines as dual dopamine–serotonin releasers|journal=Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters|volume=24|issue=19|year=2014|pages=4754–4758|issn=0960-894X|doi=10.1016/j.bmcl.2014.07.062|pmid=25193229|pmc=4211607}}</ref> In addition, it acts as a non-selective [[serotonin receptor]] [[agonist]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} A study performed in 1991<ref name="pmid1722753"/> with [[Laboratory rat|rat]] subjects provided evidence that a-ET may induce [[serotonergic]] [[neurotoxicity]] similar to that of [[MDMA]].
