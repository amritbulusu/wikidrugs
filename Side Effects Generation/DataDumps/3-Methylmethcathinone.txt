'''3-Methylmethcathinone''', also known as '''3-MMC''' and '''3-Mephedrone''',<ref>{{cite book|last1=Preedy|first1=Victor|title=Neuropathology of Drug Addictions and Substance Misuse Volume 2: Stimulants, Club and Dissociative Drugs, Hallucinogens, Steroids, Inhalants and International Aspects|publisher=KIng's College|location=London|isbn=978-0-12-800212-4|edition=2}}</ref> is a [[designer drug]] from the [[substituted cathinone]] family, with [[Empathogen-entactogen]] effects. 3-MMC is closely related in structure to the popular illicit drug [[mephedrone]] (4-MMC), and is illegal in most countries that have banned 3-mephedrone as it is a [[structural isomer]] of 4-mephedrone. However 3-MMC has still appeared on the "[[legal high]]" market as an alternative to mephedrone, and was first identified being sold in Sweden in 2012.<ref>[http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_190854_EN_TDAC12001ENC_.pdf EMCDDA 2012 Annual report on the state of the drugs problem in Europe]</ref>
Unlike other legal highs 3-MMC was tested and characterized in large mammals,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shimshoni|first1=J.

==Legal Status==

As of October 2015 3-MMC is a controlled substance in China.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sfda.gov.cn/WS01/CL0056/130753.html | title=关于印发《非药用类麻醉药品和精神药品列管办法》的通知 | publisher=China Food and Drug Administration | date=27 September 2015 | language=Chinese | accessdate=1 October 2015}}</ref>
