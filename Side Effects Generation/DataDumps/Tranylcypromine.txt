* [[Porphyria]]
* [[Cardiovascular disease|Cardiovascular]] or [[cerebrovascular disease]]
* [[Pheochromocytoma]]
* [[Tyramine]], found in several foods, is metabolized by MAO. Ingestion and absorption of tyramine causes extensive release of [[norepinephrine]], which can rapidly increase blood pressure to the point of causing [[hypertensive crisis]].
* Concomitant use of serotonin-enhancing drugs, including [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRIs]], serotonergic [[Tricyclic antidepressant|TCAs]], [[dextromethorphan]], and [[pethidine|meperidine]] may cause [[serotonin syndrome]].
* Concomitant use of [[Monoamine releasing agent|MRAs]], including [[fenfluramine]], [[amphetamine]], and [[pseudoephedrine]] may cause toxicity via serotonin syndrome or [[hypertensive crisis]].
* [[L-DOPA|<small>L</small>-DOPA]] given without [[carbidopa]] may cause hypertensive crisis.

===Dietary restrictions===
{{Main|Foods containing tyramine}}

[[Tyramine]] is a common component in many foods, and is normally rapidly metabolized by [[Monoamine oxidase A|MAO-A]]. Individuals not taking MAOIs may consume at least 2 grams of tyramine in a meal and not experience an increase in blood presure, whereas those taking MAOIs such as tranylcypromine may experience a sharp increase in blood pressure following consumption of as little as 10 mg of tyramine, which can lead to hypertensive crisis.<ref name="PMID28655495"/><ref name="pmid21192146"/>

Foods containing tyramine include [[aged cheese]]s, [[cured meat]]s, [[tofu]] and certain [[red wine]]s. Some, such as [[yeast extract]]s, contain enough tyramine to be potentially fatal in a single serving. [[Spoiled food]] is also likely to contain dangerous levels of tyramine.<ref name=EMC/>

Of note, there has not been found to be a correlation between sex and age below 65 regarding incidence of adverse effects.<ref name="pmid28579071"/>

Tranylcypromine is not associated with [[Weight gain|weight gain]] and has a low risk for hepatotoxicity compared to the [[hydrazine (Antidepressant)|hydrazine]] MAOIs.<ref name="pmid28579071"/><ref name="pmid22110357"/>

It is generally recommended that MAOIs be discontinued prior to [[anesthesia]]; however, this creates a risk of recurrent depression. In a retrospective observational cohort study, patients on tranylcypromine undergoing general anesthesia had a lower incidence of intraoperative hypotension, while there was no difference between patients not taking an MAOI regarding intraoperative incidence of bradycardia, tachycardia, or hypertension.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=van Haelst|first1=IM|last2=van Klei|first2=WA|last3=Doodeman|first3=HJ|last4=Kalkman|first4=CJ|last5=Egberts|first5=TC|last6=MAOI Study|first6=Group.|title=Antidepressive treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors and the occurrence of intraoperative hemodynamic events: a retrospective observational cohort study.|journal=The Journal of clinical psychiatry|date=August 2012|volume=73|issue=8|pages=1103-9|doi=10.4088/JCP.11m07607|pmid=22938842}}</ref> The use of indirect [[sympathomimetic drug]]s or drugs affecting serotonin reuptake, such as [[meperidine]] or [[dextromethorphan]] poses a risk for [[hypertension]] and [[serotonin syndrome]] respectively; alternative agents are recommended.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=MS|last2=Muir|first2=H|last3=Hall|first3=R|title=Perioperative management of drug therapy, clinical considerations.|journal=Drugs|date=February 1996|volume=51|issue=2|pages=238-59|pmid=8808166}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Blom-Peters|first1=L|last2=Lamy|first2=M|title=Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and anesthesia: an updated literature review.|journal=Acta anaesthesiologica Belgica|date=1993|volume=44|issue=2|pages=57-60|pmid=8237297}}</ref> Other studies have come to similar conclusions.<ref name="pmid28579071"/> Pharmacokinetic interactions with anesthetics are unlikely, given that tranylcypromine is a high-affinity substrate for [[CYP2A6]] and does not inhibit CYP enzymes at therapeutic concentrations.<ref name="PMID28655495"/>

Cases of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours have been reported during tranylcypromine therapy or early after treatment discontinuation.<ref name=EMC/>

Symptoms of tranylcypromine overdose are generally more intense manifestations of its usual effects.<ref name=EMC/>

==Interactions==
In addition to contraindicated concomitant medications, tranylcypromine inhibits [[CYP2A6]], which may reduce the metabolism and increase the toxicity of substrates of this enzyme, such as:<ref name="pmid21192146"/>

* [[Dexmedetomidine]]
* [[nicotine]]
* [[Tobacco-specific nitrosamines|TSNAs]] (found in cured tobacco products, including [[cigarette]]s)
* [[Valproate]]

[[Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s prevent neuronal uptake of [[tyramine]] and may reduce its [[pressor]] effects.<ref name="pmid21192146"/>

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
Tranylcypromine acts as a nonselective and irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase.<ref name="Foye's"/> Regarding the [[isoform]]s of monoamine oxidase, it shows slight preference for the [[MAO-B|MAOB]] [[isoenzyme]] over [[MAO-A|MAOA]].<ref name="PMID28655495"/> This leads to an increase in the availability of [[Monoamine neurotransmitter|monoamines]], such as [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[dopamine]], as well as a marked increase in the availability of [[trace amine]]s, such as [[tryptamine]], [[octopamine]], and [[phenethylamine]].<ref name="PMID28655495"/><ref name="pmid21192146"/> The clinical relevance of increased trace amine availability is unclear.

It may also act as a [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] at higher therapeutic doses.<ref name="PMID28655495"/> Compared to [[amphetamine]], tranylcypromine shows low potency as a [[dopamine]] [[releasing agent]], with even weaker potency for [[norepinephrine]] and [[serotonin]] release.<ref name="PMID28655495"/><ref name="pmid21192146"/>

Tranylcypromine has also been shown to inhibit the [[histone]] demethylase, BHC110/[[LSD1]]. Tranylcypromine inhibits this enzyme with an IC50 < 2 µM, thus acting as a small molecule inhibitor of histone demethylation with an effect to derepress the transcriptional activity of BHC110/LSD1 target genes.<ref name="pmid16793513">{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=MG|last2=Wynder|first2=C|last3=Schmidt|first3=DM|last4=McCafferty|first4=DG|last5=Shiekhattar|first5=R|title=Histone H3 lysine 4 demethylation is a target of nonselective antidepressive medications.|journal=Chemistry & Biology|date=June 2006|volume=13|issue=6|pages=563–7|doi=10.1016/j.chembiol.2006.05.004|pmid=16793513}}</ref> The clinical relevance of this effect is unknown.

Precisely because tranylcypromine was not, like [[isoniazid]] and [[iproniazid]], a [[hydrazine]] derivative, its clinical interest increased enormously, as it was thought it might have a more acceptable [[therapeutic index]] than previous MAOIs.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=López-Muñoz|first1=F|last2=Alamo|first2=C|title=Monoaminergic neurotransmission: the history of the discovery of antidepressants from 1950s until today.|journal=Current Pharmaceutical Design|date=2009|volume=15|issue=14|pages=1563–86|doi=10.2174/138161209788168001 |pmid=19442174}}</ref>
