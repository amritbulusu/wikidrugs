== Pharmacodynamics ==
Etoxadrol is a [[Non-competitive inhibition|non-competitive]] [[NMDA receptor antagonist]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Domino|first=EF|title=Chemical dissociation of human awareness: focus on non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonists.|journal=Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)|date=January 1992|volume=6|issue=3|pages=418–24|pmid=22291389|doi=10.1177/026988119200600312}}</ref> It binds [[irreversible inhibition|irreversibly]] and with high [[binding affinity|affinity]] to the [[Phencyclidine|PCP]] [[binding site]] on the [[NMDA receptor]] ([[Enzyme inhibitor#Quantitative description of reversible inhibition|K<sub>i</sub>]] = 107 nM, determined by the displacement of [[isotopic labeling|radiolabeled]] [[Tenocyclidine|TCP]]).<ref name="cite DOI|10.1021/jm00120a004"/><ref name="ReferenceA"/> Normally, the inactivated [[NMDA receptor]] possesses a [[magnesium|magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>)]] block in the [[ion channel|channel]], blocking the passage of [[Cations#Anions and cations|cations]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Paradiso|first=Mark F. Bear, Barry W. Connors, Michael A.|title=Neuroscience : exploring the brain|year=2007|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=0781760038|pages=154–155|edition=3rd}}</ref> [[File:NMDA Etoxadrol.png|thumb|NMDA receptor action in the absence (left) or presence (right) of etoxadrol.]]When the [[neurotransmitter]] [[glutamate]] binds to the [[NMDA receptor]], and the [[Postsynaptic cell#Structure|postsynaptic]] [[cell membrane]] is [[depolarization|depolarized]] (from the postsynaptic cell being activated), the [[magnesium]] block in the [[NMDA receptor]] channel is displaced. [[Calcium|Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)]] and [[sodium|sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>)]] can enter the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] via the open channel, while [[potassium|potassium (K<sup>+</sup>)]] can exit the cell. Etoxadrol [[receptor antagonist|antagonizes]] the [[NMDA receptor]] by binding to the [[phencyclidine|PCP]] site, located just above the [[magnesium]] block in the [[ion channel]]. In the event that the [[magnesium]] block is displaced, etoxadrol blocks the [[NMDA receptor]] channel, preventing [[Cations#Anions and cations|cations]] from entering or exiting the channel. This mechanism of action also applies to [[phencyclidine|PCP]], [[tenocyclidine|TCP]], [[ketamine]] and [[dexoxadrol]].

Etoxadrol binding does not affect the [[Ligand (biochemistry)#Receptor.2Fligand binding affinity|binding affinity]] of other sites on the [[NMDA receptor]], as found by binding studies showing the displacement of [[isotopic labeling|radiolabeled]] [[Tenocyclidine|TCP]] by etoxadrol (TCP binding in the absence of etoxadrol: [[Enzyme inhibitor#Quantitative description of reversible inhibition|K<sub>i</sub>]] = 19.2 x 10<sup>−9</sup> M, B<sub>max</sub> = 1.36 pmol/mg [[protein]]; TCP binding in the presence of etoxadrol: K<sub>i</sub> = 21.7 x 10<sup>−9</sup> M, B<sub>max</sub> = .66 pmol/mg protein).<ref name=thurkauf>{{cite journal|last=Thurkauf|first=A |author2=Mattson, MV |author3=Huguenin, PN |author4=Rice, KC |author5=Jacobson, AE|title=Etoxadrol-meta-isothiocyanate: a potent, enantioselective, electrophilic affinity ligand for the phencyclidine-binding site.|journal=FEBS Letters|date=Oct 10, 1988|volume=238|issue=2|pages=369–74|pmid=2901991|doi=10.1016/0014-5793(88)80514-3}}</ref>

Despite its [[anesthetic]] and [[analgesic]] effects, etoxadrol does not interact with [[Benzodiazepine receptor#Target for benzodiazepines|benzodiazepine]], [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor|muscarinic acetylcholine]], or [[mu Opioid receptor|mu opioid receptors]].<ref name=thurkauf />  However, etoxadrol may act in the [[dopamine]] [[mesolimbic pathway|reward pathway]], explaining its [[reinforcement|reinforcing properties]].<ref name="Brady 56–62"/>

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Etoxadrol goes into effect 90 seconds after [[intravenous|intravenous (IV) administration]], and its [[anesthetic]] effects typically last for half an hour to an hour.<ref name=Fredrickson>{{cite journal|last=Frederickson|first=EL |author2=Longnecker, DE |author3=Allen, GW|title=Clinical investigation of a new intravenous anesthetic--etoxadrol hydrochloride (CL-1848; U-37862A).|journal=Anesthesia and Analgesia|date=May–Jun 1976|volume=55|issue=3|pages=335–9|pmid=5921|doi=10.1213/00000539-197605000-00010}}</ref><ref name=traber>{{cite journal|last=Traber|first=DL |author2=Priano, LL |author3=Wilson, RD|title=Effects of CL 1848C, a new dissociative anesthetic, on the canine cardiovascular and respiratory systems.|journal=The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics|date=November 1970|volume=175|issue=2|pages=395–403|pmid=5481707}}</ref> Since etoxadrol is administered intravenously, the [[bioavailability|bioavailable dose]] is always the same as the administered dose. Etoxadrol’s [[analgesic]] effects can last for up to 2 hours or more after patients have regained [[consciousness]].<ref name=wilson>{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=RD |author2=Traber, DL |author3=Barratt, E |author4=Creson, DL |author5=Schmitt, RC |author6=Allen, CR|title=Evaluation of CL-1848C: a new dissociative anesthetic in normal human volunteers.|journal=Anesthesia and Analgesia|date=Mar–Apr 1970|volume=49|issue=2|pages=236–41|pmid=4931158|doi=10.1213/00000539-197003000-00011}}</ref>

Etoxadrol is [[lipophilic]] and can readily cross the [[blood–brain barrier]]. Because of its [[lipophilic]] structure, etoxadrol can be absorbed by [[adipose tissue|fat tissues]] and [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] (e.g. the [[liver]]). Etoxadrol also acts on the [[respiratory system|respiratory]] and [[cardiovascular system]]s.<ref name=traber />

== Treatment ==
Etoxadrol was intended as an [[anesthetic]] for patients requiring particularly long periods of [[anesthesia]] for [[surgery]]. As an [[anesthetic]], etoxadrol is more [[potency (pharmacology)|potent]] than [[ketamine]], but less potent than [[phencyclidine|PCP]].<ref name=wilson />

Etoxadrol is also a potent [[analgesic]]. Patients given etoxadrol often reported that they were aware of experiencing [[pain]] upon waking from [[anesthesia]], but it did not bother them.<ref name=Fredrickson /> Post-operative analgesics are rarely required after patients undergoing [[surgery]] are administered etoxadrol.

Etoxadrol (along with [[ketamine]], [[dexoxadrol]], and other [[NMDA receptor antagonist#Uncompetitive channel blockers|PCP-like drugs]]) is an [[anticonvulsant]], preventing [[Seizures#Classification|tonic seizures]] in [[mice]] that are administered [[pentylenetetrazol|pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)]], which normally induces [[seizures]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hayes|first=BA|author2=Balster, RL|title=Anticonvulsant properties of phencyclidine-like drugs in mice.|journal=European Journal of Pharmacology|date=Oct 29, 1985|volume=117|issue=1|pages=121–5|pmid=4085541|doi=10.1016/0014-2999(85)90480-7}}</ref>

== Side effects ==
Like [[ketamine]], etoxadrol produces increases in [[heart rate]] and [[respiratory rate]].<ref name=traber /> Etoxadrol may also cause [[vomiting]].<ref name=Fredrickson /> At high enough [[dose (biochemistry)|doses]], etoxadrol also exhibits effects on the [[muscular system]] such as [[convulsions]] or loss of the [[righting reflex]].<ref name=Hidalgo4994714>{{cite journal|last=Hidalgo|first=J |author2=Dileo, RM |author3=Rikimaru, MT |author4=Guzman, RJ |author5=Thompson, CR|title=Etoxadrol (CL-1848C) a new dissociative anesthetic: studies in primates and other species.|journal=Anesthesia and Analgesia|date=Mar–Apr 1971|volume=50|issue=2|pages=231–9|pmid=4994714|doi=10.1213/00000539-197103000-00016}}</ref> When administered in excess, etoxadrol can be [[Lethal dose|lethal]] on the [[respiratory system]]. [[Monkeys]] given extremely high (> 20&nbsp;mg/kg) [[dose (biochemistry)|doses]] of etoxadrol died of apparent [[respiratory failure]].

Etoxadrol produces a wide variety of [[dreams]], ranging from pleasant to frightening or aversive.<ref name=wilson /> Approximately half of patients given etoxadrol report pleasant dreams, 25% report unpleasant dreams, and the remaining 25% experience no dreams at all. Such dreams were frequently described as “floating,” “puffy” or “out of this world."  Dreams and [[hallucinations]] may persist for as long as 18 to 24 hours. In rare cases, etoxadrol can induce periods of [[psychosis|psychotic activity]] during this recovery period.<ref name=Fredrickson />
 
In the [[brain]], etoxadrol slows down the [[chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of [[serotonin]] to 50-60% of control rates and speeds up the rate of [[dopamine]] synthesis by up to 200% of the normal rate 4–6 hours after [[intravenous therapy|intravenous administration]].<ref name=Fredrickson />

Like a number of other [[drugs]] (e.g. [[cocaine]]), etoxadrol has been found to exhibit [[reinforcement|reinforcing properties]]. [[Monkeys]] will self-administer etoxadrol, [[dexoxadrol]] or [[phencyclidine|PCP]] in a lever-pressing paradigm.<ref name="Brady 56–62"/>
