'''Calcipotriol''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) or '''calcipotriene''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]) is a synthetic [[derivative (chemistry)|derivative]] of [[calcitriol]], a form of [[vitamin D]].  It is used in the treatment of [[psoriasis]], marketed under the trade name "Dovonex" in the United States, "Daivonex" outside of North America, and "Psorcutan" in Germany. This medication is safe for long-term application in psoriatic skin conditions.

==Contraindications==
Hypersensitivity, use on face, hypercalcaemia, or evidence of vitamin D toxicity are the only [[contraindications]] for calcipotriol use.<ref name = MSR/>

Cautions include exposure to excessive natural or artificial light, due to the potential for calcipotriol to cause photosensitivity.<ref name = MSR/>

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
The efficacy of calcipotriol in the treatment of psoriasis was first noticed by the observation of patients receiving various forms of vitamin D in an osteoporosis study.  Unexpectedly, some patients who also suffered from psoriasis experienced dramatic reductions in lesion counts.<ref>Morimoto, S., Kumahara, Y. A patient with psoriasis cured by 1-α-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub>. ''Med. J. Osaka Univ.'', '''1985''', 35:51–54</ref>

The precise mechanism of calcipotriol in remitting psoriasis is not well understood.  However, it has been shown to have comparable affinity with calcitriol for the [[vitamin D receptor]] (VDR), while being less than 1% as active as the calcitriol in regulating [[calcium metabolism]].  The vitamin D receptor belongs to the steroid/thyroid receptor superfamily, and is found on the cells of many different tissues including the thyroid, bone, kidney, and [[T cell]]s of the immune system. T cells are known to play a role in psoriasis, and it is thought that the binding of calcipotriol to the VDR modulates the T cells gene transcription of cell differentiation and proliferation related genes.

In mouse studies, topical calcipotriol administration to the ear and dorsal skin led to a dose-dependent increase in the production of the epithelial cell-derived cytokine [[Thymic stromal lymphopoietin|TSLP]] by [[keratinocyte]]s, and triggered [[atopic dermatitis]] at high concentrations.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Topical vitamin D3 and low-calcemic analogs induce thymic stromal lymphopoietin in mouse keratinocytes and trigger an atopic dermatitis|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date = 2006-08-01|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 1544239|pmid = 16880407|pages = 11736–11741|volume = 103|issue = 31|doi = 10.1073/pnas.0604575103|first = Mei|last = Li|first2 = Pierre|last2 = Hener|first3 = Zhikun|last3 = Zhang|first4 = Shigeaki|last4 = Kato|first5 = Daniel|last5 = Metzger|first6 = Pierre|last6 = Chambon}}</ref> This upregulation of TSLP production due to calcipotriol application is thought to be mediated through the [[Coactivation (Transcription)|coactivation]] of [[Calcitriol receptor|vitamin D receptor]]/[[Retinoid X receptor alpha|RXRα]] and vitamin D receptor/[[Retinoid X receptor beta|RXRβ]] heterodimers. As psoriasis is typically thought to be partially driven by [[T helper cell|Th1]]/[[T helper 17 cell|Th17]] inflammatory cytokines,<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Phototherapy in psoriasis: a review of mechanisms of action|journal = Journal of Cutaneous Medicine and Surgery|date = 2013-02-01|issn = 1203-4754|pmc = 3736829|pmid = 23364144|pages = 6–12|volume = 17|issue = 1|first = Tami|last = Wong|first2 = Leon|last2 = Hsu|first3 = Wilson|last3 = Liao|doi=10.2310/7750.2012.11124}}</ref> calcipotriol treatment at appropriate concentrations may alleviate psoriasis symptoms by repressing Th1/Th17 inflammation through TSLP production, which is linked to a [[T helper cell|Th2]] response. However, it is important to note that this has not yet been confirmed.

===Pharmacokinetics===
After application and systemic uptake, calcipotriol undergoes rapid [[hepatic]] metabolism. Calcipotriol is metabolized to MC1046 (the α,β−unsaturated ketone analog), which is subsequently metabolized to its primary metabolite, the saturated ketone analog MC1080. MC1080 is then slowly metabolized to [[calcitroic acid]].<ref name=Enstilar>{{cite web | title = Enstilar (calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate) Foam, 0.005%/0.064% for topical use. Full Prescribing Information | url =  http://enstilar.com/pdf/enstilar-pi.pdf | location = Parsippany, NJ | publisher = LEO Pharma Inc | date = 2015 }}</ref>

The metabolites of calcipotriol are less potent than the parent compound.

==Chemistry==
Calcipotriol is a white to almost white crystalline compound.
