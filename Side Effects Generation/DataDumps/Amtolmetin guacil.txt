'''Amtolmetin guacil''' is a [[NSAID]] which is a prodrug of [[tolmetin]] sodium.

==Background ==

Tolmetin sodium is an effective NSAID approved and marketed for the treatment of [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[osteoarthritis]] and [[juvenile rheumatoid arthritis]]. In humans, tolmetin sodium is absorbed rapidly with peak plasma levels observed 30 min after p.o. administration, but it is also eliminated rapidly with a mean plasma elimination tÂ½ of approximately 1 hr. The preparation of slow release formulations or chemical modification of NSAIDs to form prodrugs has been suggested as a method to reduce the gastrotoxicity of these agents.

Amtolmetin guacil is a non-acidic prodrug of tolmetin, having similar NSAID properties like tolmetin with additional analgesic, antipyretic, and gastro protective properties. Amtolmetin is formed by amidation of tolmetin by [[glycine]]

==Pharmacology==

*Almost is absorbed on oral administration. It is concentrated maximum in internal the gastric wall, and highest concentration reached in 2 hours after administration.
*Amtolmetin guacil hydrolysed in to following metabolites Tolmetin, MED5 and Guiacol.
*Elimination will complete in 24 hours. Happens mostly with urine in shape of gluconides products (77%), faecal (7.5%).
*It is advised to take the drug on empty stomach.
*Permanent anti-inflammatory action is continued up to 72 hours, with single administration.

==Mechanism of action==

Amtolmetin guacil stimulates [[capsaicin receptor]]s present on gastro intestinal walls, because of presence of vanillic moiety and also releases NO which is gastro protective. It also inhibits [[prostaglandin]] synthesis and [[cyclooxygenase]] (COX).
