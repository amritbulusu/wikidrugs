==Medical uses==
Rifabutin is now recommended as first-line treatment for [[tuberculosis treatment|tuberculosis]],<ref>{{cite book|publisher=World Health Organization|title=Guidelines for the programmatic management of drug-resistant tuberculosis: emergency update 2008 (WHO/HTM/TB/2008.402)|year=2008|location=Geneva, Switzerland|isbn=978-92-4-154758-1|url=http://www.who.int/tb/publications/2008/programmatic_guidelines_for_mdrtb/en/index.html|page=ix|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018020405/http://www.who.int/tb/publications/2008/programmatic_guidelines_for_mdrtb/en/index.html|archivedate=2008-10-18|df=}}</ref> but [[rifampicin]] was used more widely because of its cheaper cost. Due to expiration of patents the prices are equal as of current date. 

Rifabutin is used in the treatment of [[Mycobacterium avium complex|''Mycobacterium avium'' complex]] disease, a bacterial infection most commonly encountered in late-stage [[AIDS]] patients. Its main usefulness lies in the fact that it has lesser drug interactions than rifampicin; therefore HIV infected patients on [[HAART]] are usually given rifabutin for treatment of TB.

Rifabutin is well tolerated in patients with HIV-related tuberculosis (TB), but new findings suggest that patients with low CD<sub>4</sub> cell counts have a high risk of treatment failure or relapse due to acquired rifamycin resistance. Since patients co-infected with TB and HIV/AIDS are likely to get TB treated first, when the CD<sub>4</sub> is suppressed at the time TB treatment begins, doctors and patients should be aware of a possible rifamycin resistance.

Rifabutin is also being investigated in trials for treating [[Crohn's disease]] as part of the anti-[[Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis|MAP]] therapy. In a [[Phases of clinical research|Phase III]] study administering sub-therapeutic doses of rifabutin in combination therapy to patients not identified with MAP infections, it was associated with significant short term benefits.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=17570206 | doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2007.03.031 | volume=132 | issue=7 | title=Two-year combination antibiotic therapy with clarithromycin, rifabutin, and clofazimine for Crohn's disease |date=June 2007 | journal=Gastroenterology | pages=2313–9}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Kuenstner|first=J.

It has also found to be useful in the treatment of ''[[Chlamydophila pneumoniae]]'' (Cpn) infection.

==History==
Scientists at the Italian drug company Achifar discovered rifabutin in 1975. (Eventually Archifar became part of [[Farmitalia]] Carlo Erba, a unit of the conglomerate Montedison which was subsequently bought by [[Pharmacia]]) This company's Adria Laboratories subsidiary filed for [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approval of rifabutin under the brand name Mycobutin in the early 1990s and the drug gained FDA approval in December 1992.

Rifabutin is primarily bactericidal antibiotic drug used to treat tuberculosis. Its effect on bacteria is based on the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase blocking drug rifamycin S, a semi-synthetic derivative. It is effective, for example, in highly resistant mycobacteria, Gram-positive bacteria (and some are effective against Gram-negative bacteria), but also against ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'', ''M. leprae'', and ''M. avium intracellulare''.
