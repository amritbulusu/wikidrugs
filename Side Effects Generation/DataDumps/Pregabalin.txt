The effects of pregabalin appear after 1 week of use and is similar in effectiveness to [[lorazepam]], [[alprazolam]], and [[venlafaxine]], but pregabalin has demonstrated superiority by producing more consistent therapeutic effects for psychosomatic anxiety symptoms.<ref name="pmid17610384" /> Long-term trials have shown continued effectiveness without the development of [[drug tolerance|tolerance]], and, in addition, unlike benzodiazepines, it has a beneficial effect on sleep and [[sleep architecture]], characterized by the enhancement of [[slow-wave sleep]].<ref name="pmid17610384" /> It produces less severe cognitive and psychomotor impairment compared to those drugs; it also has a low potential for abuse and dependence and may be preferred over the benzodiazepines for these reasons.<ref name="pmid17610384">{{cite journal |last1=Bandelow |first1=Borwin |last2=Wedekind |first2=Dirk |last3=Leon |first3=Teresa |title=Pregabalin for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder: a novel pharmacologic intervention |journal=Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics |volume=7 |issue=7 |pages=769–81 |year=2007 |pmid=17610384 |doi=10.1586/14737175.7.7.769 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Owen |first1=R.T. |title=Pregabalin: Its efficacy, safety and tolerability profile in generalized anxiety |journal=Drugs of Today |volume=43 |issue=9 |pages=601–10 |year=2007 |pmid=17940637 |doi=10.1358/dot.2007.43.9.1133188 }}</ref>

== Side effects ==

Pregabalin has been shown to produce [[therapeutic effect]]s that are similar to other [[controlled substances]]. In a study with recreational users of [[sedative]] and [[hypnotic]] drugs, a 450&nbsp;mg dose of pregabalin resulted in subjective ratings of a "good drug effect" and "high" and "liking" similar to 30&nbsp;mg of [[diazepam]]. In clinical studies, pregabalin showed a [[side effect]] profile similar to other [[central nervous system depressants]].<ref name="ScheduleV" />

[[Adverse drug reaction]]s associated with the use of pregabalin include:<ref name="LyricaPI">Pfizer Australia Pty Ltd. Lyrica (Australian Approved Product Information).

=== Withdrawal symptoms ===
Following abrupt or rapid discontinuation of pregabalin, some people reported symptoms suggestive of [[physical dependence]]. The FDA determined that the [[substance dependence]] profile of pregabalin, as measured by a patient [[Drug withdrawal|physical withdrawal]] checklist, was quantitatively less than [[benzodiazepines]].<ref name="ScheduleV" />
Even people who have discontinued short term and or long term use of pregabalin have experienced [[withdrawal symptoms]], including [[insomnia]], headache, agitation, [[nausea]], [[anxiety]], diarrhea, [[flu like symptoms]], nervousness, [[major depression]], pain, [[convulsion]]s, [[hyperhidrosis]] and dizziness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicines.org.uk/EMC/medicine/14651/SPC/Lyrica+Capsules/|title=Lyrica Capsules|work=medicines.org.uk}}</ref>

===Pregnancy===
It is unclear if it is safe for use in pregnancy with some studies showing potential harm.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pregabalin Pregnancy and Breastfeeding Warnings|url=https://www.drugs.com/pregnancy/pregabalin.html|accessdate=29 August 2016}}</ref>

== Overdose ==
Several [[renal failure]] patients developed [[myoclonus]] while receiving pregabalin, apparently as a result of gradual accumulation of the drug. Acute overdosage may be manifested by [[somnolence]], [[tachycardia]] and [[hypertonicity]].

== Drug interactions ==
No interactions have been demonstrated ''[[in vivo]]''. The manufacturer notes some potential pharmacological interactions with [[opioids]], [[benzodiazepines]], [[barbiturates]], [[ethanol]] (alcohol), and other drugs that depress the central nervous system. ACE inhibitors may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Pregabalin. Pregabalin may enhance the fluid-retaining effect of Antidiabetic Agents (Thiazolidinedione).<ref>Pregabalin.

=== Pharmacodynamics ===
Although pregabalin is an [[Structural analog|analogue]] of GABA, it does not bind directly to [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub>]], [[GABAB receptor|GABA<sub>B</sub>]], [[GABAC receptor|GABA<sub>ϱ</sub>]], or [[benzodiazepine receptors]]. Nor does it block [[sodium channels]] and is not active at [[opioid receptors]]. [[Gabapentinoids]], such as pregabalin, are [[Voltage-dependent calcium channel#α2δ Subunit|α<sub>2</sub>δ subunit]] modifiers that affect GABA. In contrast to the distribution of α<sub>2</sub>δ-1 and α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 subunits binding correlates partially with GABAergic neurons.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dolphin |first1=Annette C. |title=Calcium channel auxiliary α<sub>2</sub>δ and β subunits: trafficking and one step beyond |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=13 |issue=8 |pages=542–55 |year=2012 |pmid=22805911 |doi=10.1038/nrn3311 }}  Errata is: {{cite journal |last1=Dolphin |first1=Annette C. |title=Calcium channel auxiliary α<sub>2</sub>δ and β subunits: trafficking and one step beyond |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=13 |issue=9 |year=2012 |pages=664 |doi=10.1038/nrn3317 }}</ref> Pregabalin increases the density of GABA [[Neurotransmitter transporter|transporter proteins]] and increases the rate of functional GABA [[Neurotransmitter transporter|transport]].<ref name="Pregabalin Clinical Pharmacology">{{cite web|last1=DBA Quality Care Products LLC|first1=Lake Erie Medical|title=LYRICA 200 mg|url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/fda/fdaDrugXsl.cfm?setid=e99d91ef-e189-4556-9343-5c8c9e1b6e1a&type=display|website=DailyMed|publisher=Lake Eric Medical DBA Quality Care Products LLC|accessdate=27 September 2015}}</ref> It also increases [[extracellular]] GABA concentrations in the brain by producing a dose-dependent increase in [[L-Glutamic acid decarboxylase]].<ref name="books.google.com"/>

=== Pharmacokinetics ===

[[File:Gabapentinoids.png|thumb|right|Pregabalin is not a GABA<sub>A</sub> or GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor agonist]]

==== Absorption ====

Pregabalin is rapidly absorbed when administered on an empty stomach, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within one hour. Pregabalin oral bioavailability is estimated to be greater than or equal to 90% and is independent of dose. The rate of pregabalin absorption is decreased when given with food resulting in a decrease in [[Cmax (pharmacology)|C<sub>max</sub>]] by approximately 25 to 30% and a delay in T<sub>max</sub> (time to reach C<sub>max</sub>) to approximately 3 hours.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Administration with food, however, has no clinically significant effect on the extent of absorption.<ref name="emea-spc">{{cite web |title=Summary of product characteristics |url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Product_Information/human/000546/WC500046602.pdf |date=6 March 2013 |publisher=European Medicines Agency |accessdate=6 May 2013}}</ref>

==== Distribution ====

Pregabalin has been shown to cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] in mice, rats, and monkeys. Pregabalin has been shown to cross the placenta in rats and is present in the milk of lactating rats. In humans, the [[volume of distribution]] of pregabalin for an orally administered dose is approximately 0.56 L/kg and is not bound to plasma proteins.<ref name="emea-spc" />

==== Metabolism ====

Pregabalin undergoes negligible metabolism in humans.<ref name="ADTPD">{{cite book |title=Antiepileptic Drugs to Treat Psychiatric Disorders |editor-first=Susan L. |editor-last=McElroy |editor2-first=Paul E. |editor2-last=Keck |editor3-first=Robert M. |editor3-last=Post |publisher=INFRMA-HC |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-8493-8259-8 |page=370 }}</ref> In experiments using [[nuclear medicine]] techniques, it was revealed that approximately 98% of the radioactivity recovered in the urine was unchanged pregabalin. The major metabolite is ''N''-methylpregabalin.<ref name="emea-spc" />

==== Excretion ====
Pregabalin is eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily by renal excretion as unchanged drug.<ref name="emea-spc" /> [[Renal clearance]] of pregabalin is 73 mL/minute.<ref>{{cite web |title= LYRICA – pregabalin capsule |url= http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/archives/fdaDrugInfo.cfm?archiveid=41099 |date= September 2010 |publisher= U.S. National Library of Medicine |work= DailyMed |accessdate= 6 May 2013}}</ref>

The drug was approved in the European Union in 2004. The US received [[The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or USFDA)|FDA]] approval for use in treating [[epilepsy]], [[diabetic]] [[neuropathic pain]], and [[postherpetic neuralgia]] in December 2004.

Pregabalin is marketed by [[Pfizer, Inc.|Pfizer]] under the trade name Lyrica. Pfizer described in an SEC filing that the drug could be used to treat [[epilepsy]], [[postherpetic neuralgia]], [[diabetic neuropathy|diabetic peripheral neuropathy]] and [[fibromyalgia]]. 

Since 2008, Pfizer has engaged in extensive [[direct-to-consumer advertising]] campaigns to promote its branded product Lyrica for [[fibromyalgia]] and diabetic nerve pain indications. In January 2016, the company spent a record amount, $24.6 million for a single drug on TV ads, reaching global revenues of $14 billion, more than half in the United States.<ref> B.
