'''Indiplon''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]] and [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]) is a [[nonbenzodiazepine]], [[hypnotic]] [[sedative]] that was developed in 2 formulations - an immediate release product for sleep onset and a modified-release (a.k.a. controlled-release or extended-release) version for sleep maintenance.

== Mode of action ==
Indiplon works by enhancing the action of the inhibitory neurotransmitter [[GABA]], like most other nonbenzodiazepine sedatives. It primarily binds to the α<sub>1</sub> subunits of the [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors]] in the brain.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Petroski RE |title=Indiplon is a high-affinity positive allosteric modulator with selectivity for alpha1 subunit-containing GABAA receptors |journal=J.

==History==
Indiplon was discovered at [[Lederle Laboratories]] (which was later acquired by [[Wyeth]]) in the 1980s and was called CL 285,489.<ref name=Neubauer>Neubauer, DN.  "Indiplon". pp 453-464 in GABA and Sleep: Molecular, Functional and Clinical Aspects.  Eds Jaime M. Monti, Seithikurippu Ratnas Pandi-Perumal, Hanns Möhler.  Springer Science & Business Media, 2010 {{ISBN|9783034602266}}</ref>{{rp|454}}  In 1998 Lederle licensed it, along with other early stage drug candidates, to [[DOV Pharmaceutical]], a startup formed by former Lederle employees, and Dov exclusively sublicensed its rights in the drug to [[Neurocrine Biosciences]] in that same year.<ref name=Neubauer/>  In 2002, Neurocrine entered into an agreement with Pfizer to develop the drug.<ref name=Neubauer/>

Indiplon was originally scheduled for release in 2007, when [[Sanofi-Aventis]]' popular hypnotic [[zolpidem]] lost its patent rights in the United States and thus became available as a much less expensive generic. In 2002, [[Neurocrine Biosciences]] had entered into an agreement with [[Pfizer]] to co-market indiplon in the US, in a deal worth a potential $400mn.<ref>[http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2010/06/18/san-diegos-neurocrine-biosciences-scores-second-bi.aspx San Diego's Neurocrine Biosciences Scores Second Big Deal in Two Days] - [[The Motley Fool]], 18 June 2010</ref>  However, following the issuing of a non-approvable letter for the modified-release 15&nbsp;mg formulation and an approvable letter with stipulations for the 5&nbsp;mg and 10&nbsp;mg immediate-release version by the FDA in May 2006,<ref>[http://www.thestreet.com/story/10285854/2/neurocrines-fda-nightmare.html Neurocrine's FDA Nightmare] - TheStreet.com, 16 May 2006</ref> [[Pfizer]] ended its relationship with Neurocrine.<ref>[http://www.thestreet.com/story/10293335/pfizer-drops-neurocrine-deal.html Pfizer Drops Neurocrine Deal] - TheStreet.com, 22 June 2006</ref> Neurocrine's stock price dropped 60% on the news.<ref>[http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/16/news/companies/indiplon/index.htm Neurocrine stock price plunges 60 percent:FDA's mixed review of sleeping pill Indiplon could threaten Pfizer-Neurocrine partnership] - CNN Money, 15 May 2006</ref>

Following a resubmission, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] in December 2007 deemed Neurocrine's [[new drug application]] (NDA) 'approvable' in the 5 and 10&nbsp;mg formulations,<ref name="pr1213">{{cite press release

Following the 2007 FDA letter, Neurocrine decided to discontinue all clinical and marketing development of Indiplon in the United States.<ref name="pr1213" /><ref name="pressrelease1" />
