'''Potassium sulfate (K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>)''' (in British English '''potassium sulphate''', also called '''sulphate of potash''', '''arcanite''', or archaically known as '''potash of sulfur''') is a non-flammable white crystalline [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] which is [[Solubility|soluble]] in [[water]]. The [[chemical compound]] is commonly used in [[fertilizer]]s, providing both [[potassium]] and [[sulfur]].

When potassium sulfate is heated in water and subjected to swirling in a beaker, the crystals form a multi-arm [[spiral]] structure when allowed to settle.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Sunil|title=Potassium sulfate forms a spiral structure when dissolved in solution|journal=Russian J Phys Chem B|date=2017|volume=11|pages=195–198|doi=10.1134/S1990793117010328|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1990793117010328}}</ref> Potassium sulfate could be used to study spiral structures in the laboratory.

==History==
Potassium sulfate (K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) has been known since early in the 14th century, and it was studied by [[Johann Rudolf Glauber|Glauber]], [[Robert Boyle|Boyle]], and Tachenius. In the 17th century, it was named ''arcanuni'' or ''sal duplicatum'', as it was a combination of an [[acid salt]] with an [[alkali]]ne salt. It was also known as ''vitriolic tartar'' and ''Glaser's salt'' or ''sal polychrestum Glaseri'' after the pharmaceutical chemist [[Christopher Glaser]] who prepared it and used medicinally.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=De Milt|first1=Clara|title=Christopher Glaser|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=19|pages=53|year=1942|doi=10.1021/ed019p53|issue=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Klooster|first1=van|title=Three centuries of Rochelle salt|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=36|pages=314|year=1959|doi=10.1021/ed036p314|issue=7}}</ref>

==Natural resources==
The mineral form of potassium sulfate, [[arcanite]], is relatively rare. Natural resources of potassium sulfate are [[minerals]] abundant in the [[Stassfurt salt]]. These are cocrystallizations of potassium sulfate and sulfates of [[magnesium]] [[calcium]] and [[sodium]].

Relevant minerals are:
*[[Kainite]], MgSO<sub>4</sub>·KCl·H<sub>2</sub>O
*[[Schönite]], K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>·MgSO<sub>4</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O
*[[Leonite]], K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>·MgSO<sub>4</sub>·4H<sub>2</sub>O
*[[Langbeinite]], K<sub>2</sub>Mg<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>
*[[Glaserite]], K<sub>3</sub>Na(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>
*[[Polyhalite]], K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>·MgSO<sub>4</sub>·2CaSO<sub>4</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O

The potassium sulfate can be separated from some of these minerals, like kainite, because the corresponding salt is less soluble in water.

[[Kieserite]], MgSO<sub>4</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O, can be combined with a solution of [[potassium chloride]] to produce potassium sulfate.

==Production==
Approximately 1.5 million tons were produced in 1985, typically by the reaction of [[potassium chloride]] with [[sulfuric acid]], analogous to the [[Nicolas Leblanc|Leblanc]] process. Potassium sulfate is produced according to the following reaction, which is conducted in so-called Mannheim furnaces:<ref name=Ullmann>H. Schultz, G. Bauer, E. Schachl, F. Hagedorn, P. Schmittinger "Potassium Compounds" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a22_039}}</ref>
:2 KCl  +  H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>   →   2 HCl  +  K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>

The [[James Hargreaves (chemist)|Hargreaves]] process uses [[sulfur dioxide]], [[oxygen]] and [[water]] and [[potassium chloride]] as the starting materials to produce potassium sulfate. Hydrochloric acid evaporates.  SO<sub>2</sub> is produced through the burning of sulfur.

==Structure and properties==
Two crystalline forms are known.  Orthorhombic β-K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is the common form, but it converts to α-K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> above 583&nbsp;°C.<ref name=Ullmann/> These structures are complex, although the sulfate adopts the typical tetrahedral geometry.<ref>Gaultier, M.; Pannetier, G. "Structure cristalline de la forme 'basse temperature' du sulfate de potassium K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>-beta" (Crystal structure of the "low temperature" β-form of potassium sulfate) Bulletin de la Societe Chimique de France 1968, vol. 1, pp. 105-12.</ref>

It does not form a hydrate, unlike [[sodium sulfate]].  The salt crystallize as double six-sided pyramids, classified as rhombic. They are transparent, very hard and have a bitter, salty taste. The salt is soluble in water, but insoluble in solutions of [[potassium hydroxide]] ([[Specific gravity|sp. gr.]] 1.35), or in absolute [[ethanol]].

==Uses==
The dominant use of potassium sulfate is as a [[fertilizer]]. K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> does not contain chloride, which can be harmful to some crops. Potassium sulfate is preferred for these crops, which include tobacco and some fruits and vegetables. Crops that are less sensitive may still require potassium sulfate for optimal growth if the soil accumulates chloride from irrigation water.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fertilizer manual|year=1998|publisher=Kluwer academic publ.|location=Dordrecht|isbn=0-7923-5032-4|pages=615|edition=3rd|author=organization, United Nations industrial development, UNIDO, [[International Fertilizer Development Center]], IFDC}}</ref>

The crude salt is also used occasionally in the manufacture of glass. Potassium sulfate is also used as a flash reducer in [[artillery]] [[propellant]] charges. It reduces [[muzzle flash]], flareback and blast overpressure.

It is sometimes used as an alternative blast media similar to [[sodium bicarbonate|soda]] in [[soda blasting]] as it is harder and similarly water-soluble.<ref>{{cite web|title=Super K (Potassium Sulphate)|url=http://americansurfaceprep.com/products/|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref>

==Reactions==

===Acidification===
[[Potassium hydrogen sulfate]] (also known as potassium bisulfate), KHSO<sub>4</sub>, is readily produced by reacting K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> with [[sulfuric acid]]. It forms [[rhombic pyramids]], which melt at {{convert|197|C|F}}. It dissolves in three parts of water at {{convert|0|C|F}}. The solution behaves much as if its two [[Congener (chemistry)|congener]]s, K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, were present side by side of each other uncombined; an excess of ethanol the precipitates normal sulfate (with little bisulfate) with excess acid remaining.

The behavior of the fused dry salt is similar when heated to several hundred degrees; it acts on [[silicate]]s, [[titanate]]s, etc., the same way as [[sulfuric acid]] that is heated beyond its natural boiling point does. Hence it is frequently used in analytical chemistry as a disintegrating agent. For information about other salts that contain sulfate, see [[sulfate]].

===Reduction===
At high temperatures, it is reduced to [[potassium sulfide]] by the action of [[carbon monoxide]].
