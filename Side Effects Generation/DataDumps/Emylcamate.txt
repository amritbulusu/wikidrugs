'''Emylcamate''' (marketed as '''Striatran''' by [[Merck & Co.|Merck]]) is an [[anxiolytic]] and [[muscle relaxant]]. It was patented in the US in 1961 (US Patent 2,972,564) and advertised for the treatment of anxiety and tension. It was claimed to be superior to [[meprobamate]], which was the market leader at the time. It is no longer prescribed.

A study of the drug's effects in mice was done in 1959. It concluded that at 50 mg/kg emylcamate gave a 63% decrease in motor activity compared with meprobamate's 32% decrease, a doubling in effective potency. The therapeutic index in mice was also established:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Meprobamate !! Emylcamate !! Effect
|-
| 175 || 123 || [[Effective_dose_(pharmacology)| ED<sub>50</sub>]] (mg/kg)
|-
| 600 || 550|| [[Median_lethal_dose| LD<sub>50</sub>]] (mg/kg)
|-
| 3.4 || 4.4|| [[Therapeutic index]]
|}

Emylcamate also has a faster intra-parenteral onset then meprobabamate, 3 minutes compared with 35.
