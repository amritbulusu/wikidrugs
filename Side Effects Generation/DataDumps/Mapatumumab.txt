'''Mapatumumab''' ('''HGS-ETR1''') is an experimental [[human]] [[monoclonal antibody]] undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of cancer.<ref>[http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/365/mapatumumab.doc Statement On A Nonproprietary Name Adopted By The Usan Council - Mapatumumab], ''American Medical Association''.</ref> It targets TRAIL-R1, also known as [[DR4]], which is expressed on the surface of many tumor cell types.

== Development history ==
This drug was discovered by [[Cambridge Antibody Technology]], now [[AstraZeneca]], and [[Human Genome Sciences]], now [[GlaxoSmithKline]], as a result of the collaboration between the two companies in 1999 in exploitation of CAT's [[phage display]] technology. Early work by the two companies indicated that mapatumumab induced cell death in multiple tumor types both in vitro and in vivo.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/sj.bjc.6602487|pmc=2361994|url=http://www.nature.com/bjc/journal/v92/n8/abs/6602487a.html|pmid=15846298|title=HGS-ETR1, a fully human TRAIL-receptor 1 monoclonal antibody, induces cell death in multiple tumour types in vitro and in vivo|year=2005|last1=Pukac|first1=L|last2=Kanakaraj|first2=P|last3=Humphreys|first3=R|last4=Alderson|first4=R|last5=Bloom|first5=M|last6=Sung|first6=C|last7=Riccobene|first7=T|last8=Johnson|first8=R|last9=Fiscella|first9=M|last10=Mahoney|first10=A|last11=Carrell|first11=J|last12=Boyd|first12=E|last13=Yao|first13=X T|last14=Zhang|first14=L|last15=Zhong|first15=L|last16=von Kerczek|first16=A|last17=Shepard|first17=L|last18=Vaughan|first18=T|last19=Edwards|first19=B|last20=Dobson|first20=C|last21=Salcedo|first21=T|last22=Albert|first22=V|journal=British Journal of Cancer|volume=92|issue=8|pages=1430–41|display-authors=8}}</ref>

== Clinical trials ==

A phase 1 [[clinical trial]] in 2004 demonstrated the safety and tolerability of mapatumumab in cancer patients with advanced solid tumors or [[non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma]], and supported further evaluation in phase 2 clinical trials, both as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hgsi.com/latest/human-genome-sciences-reports-results-of-ongoing-phase-1-clinical-trials-of-hgs-etr1-in-patients-with-advanced-ca.html|title=Human Genome Sciences reports results of ongoing phase 1 clinical trials of HGS-ETR1 in patients with advanced cancers|publisher=Human Genome Sciences|date=September 29, 2004}}</ref> In a phase 2 clinical trial, mapatumumab was well tolerated and could be administered safely in patients with advanced [[non-small-cell lung cancer]] (NSCLC) and advanced [[colorectal cancer]]. Stable disease was observed in a number of NSCLC patients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hgsi.com/latest/human-genome-sciences-reports-results-of-phase-2-clinical-trial-of-hgs-etr1-in-patients-with-non-small-cell-lung-c.html|title=Human Genome Sciences reports results of phase 2 clinical trial of HGS-ETR1 in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer|publisher=Human Genome Sciences|date=July 5, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hgsi.com/latest/human-genome-sciences-reports-results-of-phase-2-clinical-trial-of-hgs-etr1-in-patients-with-advanced-colorectal-c.html|title=Human Genome Sciences reports results of phase 2 clinical trial of HGS-ETR1 in patients with advanced colorectal cancer|publisher=Human Genome Sciences|date=November 1, 2005}}</ref> In two phase 1b clinical trials mapatumumab in combination with chemotherapy was well tolerated by patients with advanced [[solid tumor]]s.

===Multiple myeloma===
In 2008 HGS reported initial results of a randomised phase 2 trial of mapatumumab in combination with [[bortezomib]] in advanced [[multiple myeloma]].<ref name=HGS-MM-2008>{{cite web|url=http://www.hgsi.com/latest/human-genome-sciences-reports-initial-results-of-randomized-phase-2-trial-of-hgs-etr1-in-combination-with-bortezomib-in-advanced-multiple-my-5.html|title=Human Genome Sciences reports initial results of randomized phase 2 clinical trial of HGS-ETR1 in combination with bortezomib in advanced multiple myeloma|publisher=Human Genome Sciences|date=September 2, 2008}}</ref> However, in 2010, mapatumumab failed in a midstage study. There was no difference in disease response or progression-free survival rates between patients receiving the drug for multiple myeloma and the control group.<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9G7NV1O1.htm Human Genome Sciences says cancer drug fails study, bloomberg.com, June 9, 2010]</ref>

===Non-small-cell lung cancer===
"In August 2008, ... initial dosing of patients in a randomized Phase 2 trial of HGS-ETR1 (10 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg) in combination with [[paclitaxel]] and [[carboplatin]] as first-line therapy in patients with advanced [[non-small-cell lung cancer]] (NSCLC); initial data from the study are anticipated in 2009."<ref name=HGS-MM-2008/>

===Liver cancer===
"In July 2008, HGS initiated dosing in ... a randomized Phase 2 trial of HGS-ETR1 in combination with Nexavar ([[sorafenib]]) in patients with advanced hepatocellular cancer, which accounts for 80-90% of all [[liver cancer]]s."<ref name=HGS-MM-2008/>
