==Effects==
{{medref|section|date=June 2014}}
* The visual effects of 2C-C are similar to those of LSD or psilocybin mushrooms, though much less intense at commonly taken doses. Unique among the psychedelics, 2C-C is intensely relaxing, almost sedating.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Nasal [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflation]] (extremely painful) or rectal administration bypasses first pass metabolism, requiring about half the dose normally used orally; the effects occur within 2–30 minutes via these routes and tend to last about an hour or two. 
* The effects can take up to two hours to manifest.
* Over the approximate dose range 20–40&nbsp;mg, effects last respectively, approximately, 4 to 8 hours. Increased dosages increase the duration of the trip.<ref name="CitePiHKAL"/>
