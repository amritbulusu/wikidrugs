Along with other calcium channel blockers, verapamil is known to induce [[gingival hyperplasia]].

===Overdose===
Acute overdose is often manifested by nausea, asthenia, bradycardia, dizziness, hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmia. Plasma, serum, or blood concentrations of verapamil and norverapamil, its major active metabolite, may be measured to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of fatalities. Blood or plasma verapamil concentrations are usually in a range of 50-500 μg/l in persons on therapy with the drug, but may rise to 1–4&nbsp;mg/l in acute overdose patients and are often at levels of 5–10&nbsp;mg/l in fatal poisonings.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/15563650500514541 |title=Monitoring of Verapamil Enantiomers Concentration in Overdose |year=2006 |last1=Wilimowska |first1=Jolanta |last2=Piekoszewski |first2=Wojciech |last3=Krzyanowska-Kierepka |first3=Ewa |last4=Florek |first4=Ewa |journal=Clinical Toxicology |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=169–71 |pmid=16615674}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=R. |last=Baselt |title=Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man |edition=8th |publisher=Biomedical Publications |location=Foster City, California |year=2008 |pages=1637–9}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Verapamil's [[mechanism of action|mechanism]] in all cases is to block [[voltage-dependent calcium channel]]s.<ref name=":0" />  In cardiac pharmacology, calcium channel blockers are considered class-IV [[antiarrhythmic agents]]. Since calcium channels are especially concentrated in the [[Sinoatrial node|sinoatrial]] and [[atrioventricular node]]s, these agents can be used to decrease impulse conduction through the AV node, thus protecting the [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricles]] from atrial tachyarrhythmias.

Calcium channels are also present in the [[smooth muscle]] lining blood vessels. By relaxing the tone of this smooth muscle, calcium channel blockers dilate the blood vessels. This has led to their use in treating [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] and [[angina pectoris]]. The pain of angina is caused by a deficit in oxygen supply to the heart. Calcium channel blockers like verapamil dilate blood vessels, which increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.<ref>{{Cite web|title = DailyMed - VERAPAMIL HYDROCHLORIDE - verapamil hydrochloride tablet|url = http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=10881745-3a16-44c3-9b94-60433218f1d6|website = dailymed.nlm.nih.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-09|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160202015356/http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=10881745-3a16-44c3-9b94-60433218f1d6|archivedate = 2 February 2016|df = dmy-all}}</ref> This controls chest pain, but only when used regularly. It does not stop chest pain once it starts. A more powerful vasodilator such as [[glyceryl trinitrate|nitroglycerin]] may be needed to control pain once it starts.

==Pharmacokinetic details==
More than 90% of verapamil is absorbed when given orally,<ref name=":0" /> but due to high [[first-pass metabolism]], [[bioavailability]] is much lower (10–35%). It is 90% [[plasma protein binding|bound to plasma proteins]] and has a [[volume of distribution]] of 3–5 l/kg. It takes 1 to 2 hours to reach peak plasma concentration after oral administration.<ref name=":0" /> It is metabolized in the liver to at least 12 inactive metabolites (though one metabolite, norverapamil, retains 20% of the vasodilating activity of the parent drug). As its metabolites, 70% is excreted in the urine and 16% in feces; 3–4% is excreted unchanged in urine. This is a nonlinear dependence between plasma concentration and dosage. Onset of action is 1–2 hours after oral dosage. Half-life is 5–12 hours (with chronic dosages). It is not cleared by hemodialysis. It is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse reaction in nursing infants, nursing should be discontinued while verapamil is administered.

Verapamil has been reported to be effective in both short-term<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=6439057 |year=1984 |last1=Giannini |first1=AJ |last2=Houser Jr |first2=WL |last3=Loiselle |first3=RH |last4=Giannini |first4=MC |last5=Price |first5=WA |title=Antimanic effects of verapamil |volume=141 |issue=12 |pages=1602–3 |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry}}</ref> and long-term treatment of mania and hypomania.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=3325531 |year=1987 |last1=Giannini |first1=AJ |last2=Taraszewski |first2=R |last3=Loiselle |first3=RH |title=Verapamil and lithium in maintenance therapy of manic patients |volume=27 |issue=12 |pages=980–2 |journal=Journal of clinical pharmacology |doi=10.1002/j.1552-4604.1987.tb05600.x}}</ref> Addition of [[magnesium oxide]] to the verapamil treatment protocol enhances the antimanic effect.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0165-1781(99)00116-X |title=Magnesium oxide augmentation of verapamil maintenance therapy in mania |year=2000 |last1=Giannini |first1=A.James |last2=Nakoneczie |first2=Ann M. |last3=Melemis |first3=Stephen M. |last4=Ventresco |first4=James |last5=Condon |first5=Maggie |journal=Psychiatry Research |volume=93 |pages=83–7 |pmid=10699232 |issue=1}}</ref> It has on occasion been used to control [[mania]] in pregnant patients, especially in the first three months. It does not appear to be significantly teratogenic. For this reason, when one wants to avoid taking [[Depakote|valproic acid]] (which is high in teratogenicity) or [[lithium carbonate|lithium]] (which has a small but significant incidence of causing cardiac malformation), verapamil is usable as an alternative, albeit presumably a less effective one.

It is also used in fluorescent cell sorting for [[DNA]] content, as it blocks efflux of a variety of DNA-binding [[fluorophore]]s such as [[Hoechst 33342]]. [[Isotopic labeling|Radioactively labelled]] verapamil and [[positron emission tomography]] can be used with to measure P-glycoprotein function.<ref name="pgp2">{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jlcr.632 |title=Fully automated high yield synthesis of (R)- and (S)-[11C]verapamil for measuring P-glycoprotein function with positron emission tomography |year=2002 |last1=Luurtsema |first1=Gert |last2=Windhorst |first2=Albert D. |last3=Mooijer |first3=Martien P.J. |last4=Herscheid |first4=Jacobus D.M. |last5=Lammertsma |first5=Adriaan A. |last6=Franssen |first6=Eric J.F. |journal=Journal of Labelled Compounds and Radiopharmaceuticals |volume=45 |issue=14 |pages=1199–207}}</ref>
