'''Sulfoaildenafil''' (thioaildenafil) is a synthetic chemical compound that is a [[structural analog]] of [[sildenafil]] (Viagra).<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Gratz | first1 = SR | last2 = Zeller | first2 = M | last3 = Mincey | first3 = DW | last4 = Flurer | first4 = CL | title = Structural characterization of sulfoaildenafil, an analog of sildenafil | journal = Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis | volume = 50 | issue = 2 | pages = 228–31 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19427155 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpba.2009.04.003 }}</ref>  It was first reported in 2005,<ref>Li, Shuxin; Ren, Jianping; Zhao, Yanjin; Lv, Qiujun; Guo, Jinhua.

In December 2010, the [[Food and Drug Administration|United States Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) issued a warning to consumers about such products stating, "The FDA has found many products marketed as dietary supplements for sexual enhancement during the past several years that can be harmful because they contain active ingredients in FDA-approved drugs or variations of these ingredients."<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm236538.htm FDA warns consumers to avoid Man Up Now capsules], [[United States Food and Drug Administration]], Dec. 15, 2010</ref>
