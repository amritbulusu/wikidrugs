'''(-)-1-(Benzofuran-2-yl)-2-propylaminopentane''' ('''(-)-BPAP'''),<ref>US Patent 6214859</ref> BFPAPn, or BFPAP is a [[drug]] with an unusual effects profile. It can loosely be grouped with the [[stimulant]] or [[antidepressant]] drug families, but its mechanism of action is quite different.<ref>Shimazu S, Takahata K, Katsuki H, Tsunekawa H, Tanigawa A, Yoneda F, Knoll J, Akaike A. (-)-1-(Benzofuran-2-yl)-2-propylaminopentane enhances locomotor activity in rats due to its ability to induce dopamine release.

BPAP (along with another similar compound [[(-)-1-phenyl-2-propylaminopentane|PPAP]]) is classified as a [[catecholamine]]rgic and [[serotonergic]] activity enhancer. This means that it stimulates the [[Action potential|impulse]] propagation mediated transmitter release of the [[neurotransmitter]]s [[dopamine]], [[norepinephrine]] and [[serotonin]] in the brain. However, unlike stimulant drugs like [[amphetamine]], which release a flood of these neurotransmitters in an uncontrolled manner, BPAP instead only increases the amount of neurotransmitter that gets released when a [[neuron]] is stimulated by receiving an impulse from a neighbouring neuron. So while both amphetamine and BPAP increase the amount of neurotransmitters that get released, amphetamine causes neurons to dump neurotransmitter stores into the [[synapse]] regardless of external input, while with BPAP the pattern of neurotransmitter release is not changed, but when the neuron would normally release neurotransmitter, a larger amount than normal is released.<ref>Knoll J, Yoneda F, Knoll B, Ohde H, Miklya I. (-)-1-(Benzofuran-2-yl)-2-propylaminopentane, [(-)BPAP], a selective enhancer of the impulse propagation mediated release of catecholamines and serotonin in the brain. ''[[British Journal of Pharmacology]]'' 1999; 128: 1723-1732</ref><ref>Oka T, Yasusa T, Ando T, Watanabe M, Yoneda F, Ishida T, Knoll J. Enantioselective Synthesis and Absolute Configuration of (-)-1-(Benzofuran-2-yl)-2-propylaminopentane ((-)BPAP), a Highly Potent and Selective Catecholaminergic Activity Enhancer. ''Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry.'' 2001; 9: 1213-1219.</ref>

Other drugs which produce this effect are the [[endogenous]] [[trace amine]]s [[phenethylamine]] and [[tryptamine]], and the [[neuroprotective]] [[Monoamine oxidase B|MAO-B]] [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|inhibitor]] [[selegiline]].<ref>Shimazu S, Miklya I. Pharmacological studies with endogenous enhancer substances: Î²-phenethylamine, tryptamine, and their synthetic derivatives. ''Progress in Neuropsychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry''. 2004; 28: 421-427.</ref> However, while selegiline is a potent [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]], BPAP is only a weak [[Monoamine oxidase A|MAO-A]] inhibitor at high doses, and at low doses produces only the activity enhancer effect.

BPAP has been shown to have [[neuroprotective]] effects similar to those of selegiline, and has been researched for the treatment of [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[clinical depression]].<ref>Gaszner P, Miklya I. Major depression and the synthetic enhancer substances (-)-deprenyl and (-)-1-(Benzofuran-2-yl)-2-propylaminopentane.
