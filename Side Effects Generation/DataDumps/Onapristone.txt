As of 2016, onapristone has re-emerged and is under development for the treatment of [[prostate cancer]], currently in [[Phases of clinical research#Phase II|phase II]] [[clinical trial]]s.<ref name="AdisInsight">http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800000877</ref> It was also under development for the treatment of [[endometrial cancer]], breast cancer, [[ovarian cancer]], and [[uterine cancer]], but was discontinued for these indications in favor of focusing on prostate cancer.<ref name="AdisInsight" />
