'''25I-NBOH''' ('''NBOH-2CI''', '''Cimbi-27''', '''2-C-I-NBOH''') is a derivative of the [[phenethylamine]] derived hallucinogen [[2C-I]] that was discovered in 2006 by a team at [[Purdue University]]. It acts as a potent [[agonist]] for the [[5HT2A receptor|5HT<sub>2A</sub>]] [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]],<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Ettrup | first1 = A. | last2 = Hansen | first2 = M. | last3 = Santini | first3 = M.

25I-NBOH is notable as one of the most selective agonist ligands for the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor with an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.074 nM and more than 400x selectivity over the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Hansen | first1 = M. | last2 = Phonekeo | first2 = K. | last3 = Paine | first3 = J.

==Legality==

===Sweden===
[[Riksdag|The Riksdag]] added 25I-NBOH to [[:sv:Narkotikastrafflagen|Narcotic Drugs Punishments Act]] under ''swedish schedule I'' (''"substances, plant materials and fungi which normally do not have medical use"'') as of August 18, 2015, published by [[Medical Products Agency (Sweden)|Medical Products Agency (MPA)]] in regulation ''HSLF-FS 2015:12'' listed as '''25I-NBOH''', and '''2-([2-(4-jodo-2,5-dimetoxifenyl)etylamino]metyl)fenol'''.<ref>https://lakemedelsverket.se/upload/lvfs/HSLF_FS_2015_12.pdf</ref>
