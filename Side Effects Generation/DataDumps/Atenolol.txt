'''Atenolol''' is a selective [[beta-1 receptor|β<sub>1</sub> receptor]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]], a drug belonging to the group of [[beta blocker]]s (sometimes written β-blockers), a class of drugs used primarily in [[cardiovascular disease]]s. Introduced in 1976, atenolol was developed as a replacement for [[propranolol]] in the treatment of [[hypertension]]. It works by slowing down the heart and reducing its workload. Unlike [[propranolol]], atenolol does not readily pass through the [[blood–brain barrier]], thus decreasing the incidence of [[central nervous system]] side effects.<ref name="BBB">{{cite journal |vauthors=Agon P, Goethals P, Van Haver D, Kaufman JM |title=Permeability of the blood–brain barrier for atenolol studied by positron emission tomography |journal=Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology |volume=43 |issue=8 |pages=597–600 |date=August 1991 |pmid=1681079 |doi= 10.1111/j.2042-7158.1991.tb03545.x|url= }}</ref>

Atenolol is one of the most widely used β-blockers in the United Kingdom and was once the first-line treatment for hypertension.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Atenolol is effective at reducing blood pressure, but recent studies indicate that it does not reduce the [[morbidity]] or [[mortality rate|mortality]] caused by hypertension, and may even increase mortality in some subgroups.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">{{cite journal |pmid=23581644 | doi=10.1111/ggi.12073 | volume=14 | title=Atenolol use is associated with long-term mortality in community-dwelling older adults with hypertension | year=2014 | journal=Geriatrics & Gerontology International | pages=153–8 | vauthors=Testa G, Cacciatore F, Della-Morte D, Mazzella F, Mastrobuoni C, Galizia G, Gargiulo G, Rengo F, Bonaduce D, Abete P}}</ref>  This means that when people take this drug, they get better blood pressure numbers, but they still die of [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]] and [[stroke]]s, despite the lower blood pressure.

In addition, the role for β-blockers in general in hypertension was downgraded in June 2006 in the United Kingdom, and later in the United States, as they are less appropriate than newer blood pressure medications including [[calcium channel blocker]]s, [[thiazide]] diuretics, [[angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor|angiotension converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors]], and [[angiotension receptor blockers]], particularly in the elderly.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Medical uses==
Atenolol is used for a number of conditions including [[hypertension]], [[angina]], [[long QT syndrome]], [[acute myocardial infarction]], [[supraventricular tachycardia]], [[ventricular tachycardia]], and the symptoms of [[alcohol withdrawal]].<ref name=AHFS>{{cite web|title=Atenolol|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/atenolol.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref>

Off-label uses of atenolol, as with other cardioselective β-blockers, include symptomatic treatment of psychological issues such as anxiety. β-blockers are effective for some in treating the somatic (physical) effects of anxiety. In these instances, dosing is used as needed instead of regular daily dosing.

Due to its [[hydrophilic]] (water-attracting) properties, the drug is less suitable in [[migraine]] prophylaxis compared to propranolol, because, for this indication, atenolol would have to reach the brain in high concentrations, which is not the case, because atenolol does not pass through the [[blood–brain barrier]].<ref name="BBB"/>

==Side effects==
{{see also|Beta blocker}}

Atenolol was the main β-blocker identified as carrying a higher risk of provoking [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]], leading to its downgrading in the United Kingdom in June 2006 to fourth-line agent in the management of hypertension.<ref name="NHSnews">{{cite web|author=Sheetal Ladva |title=NICE and BHS launch updated hypertension guideline |url=http://www.nelm.nhs.uk/Record%20Viewing/viewRecord.aspx?id= |date=2006-06-28 |publisher=[[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617025556/http://www.nelm.nhs.uk/Record%20Viewing/viewRecord.aspx?id= |archivedate=17 June 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref>

Antihypertensive therapy with atenolol provides weaker protective action against cardiovascular complications (e.g. myocardial infraction and [[stroke]]) compared to other antihypertensive drugs. In some cases, [[diuretic]]s are superior.<ref name="pmid15530629">{{cite journal |vauthors=Carlberg B, Samuelsson O, Lindholm LH |title=Atenolol in hypertension: is it a wise choice? |journal=The Lancet |volume=364 |issue=9446 |pages=1684–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15530629 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17355-8}}</ref> In addition, atenolol has been found to lack mortality benefits<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 3941231 | pmid=24672712 | doi=10.1155/2014/919256 | volume=2014 | title=Beta-Blockers in the Management of Hypertension and/or Chronic Kidney Disease | year=2014 | journal=International Journal of Hypertension | pages=919256 | vauthors=Tomiyama H, Yamashina A}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 4371808 | pmid=25821584 | doi=10.1136/openhrt-2014-000230 | volume=2 | title=&beta;-Blockers in hypertension, diabetes, heart failure and acute myocardial infarction: a review of the literature | year=2015 | journal=Open Heart | pages=e000230 | vauthors=DiNicolantonio JJ, Fares H, Niazi AK, Chatterjee S, D'Ascenzo F, Cerrato E, Biondi-Zoccai G, Lavie CJ, Bell DS, O'Keefe JH}}</ref> and even to increase mortality in older adults.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/>

===Overdose===
Symptoms of [[overdose]] are due to excessive pharmacodynamic actions on β<sub>1</sub> and also β<sub>2</sub>-receptors. These include [[bradycardia]] (slow heartbeat), severe [[hypotension]] with [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], acute [[heart failure]], [[hypoglycemia]] and bronchospastic reactions. Treatment is largely symptomatic. Hospitalization and intensive monitoring is indicated. [[Activated charcoal]] is useful to absorb the drug. [[Atropine]] will counteract bradycardia, [[glucagon]] helps with hypoglycemia, [[dobutamine]] can be given against hypotension and the inhalation of a β<sub>2</sub>-mimetic as [[hexoprenalin]] or [[salbutamol]] will terminate bronchospasms. Blood or plasma atenolol concentrations may be measured to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Plasma levels are usually less than 3&nbsp;mg/L during therapeutic administration, but can range from 3–30&nbsp;mg/L in overdose victims.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = DeLima LG, Kharasch ED, Butler S | title = Successful pharmacologic treatment of massive atenolol overdose: sequential hemodynamics and plasma atenolol concentrations | journal = Anesthesiology | volume = 83 | pages = 204–207 | year = 1995 | doi = 10.1097/00000542-199507000-00025 | pmid = 7605000 | issue = 1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author = R.

==Society and culture==
Atenolol has been given as an example of how slow healthcare providers are to change their prescribing practices in the face of [[Evidence-based medicine|medical evidence]] that indicates that a drug is ineffective.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/when-evidence-says-no-but-doctors-say-yes|title=When Evidence Says No, But Doctors Say Yes|last=Epstein|first=David|date=2017-02-22|newspaper=ProPublica|access-date=2017-02-24|language=en}}</ref>  In 2012, 33.8 million prescriptions were written to American patients for this drug.<ref name=":0" /> In 2014, it was in the top (most common) 1% of drugs prescribed to Medicare patients.<ref name=":0" />  Although the number of prescriptions has been declining steadily since the evidence against its efficacy was published, it has been estimated that it would take 20 years for doctors to stop prescribing it for hypertension.<ref name=":0" />
