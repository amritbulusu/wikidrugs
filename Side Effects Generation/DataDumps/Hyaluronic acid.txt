'''Hyaluronic acid''' ('''HA'''; [[conjugate acid|conjugate base]] '''hyaluronate'''), also called '''hyaluronan''', is an [[Anion#Anions and cations|anionic]], [[Sulfation|nonsulfated]] [[glycosaminoglycan]] distributed widely throughout [[connective tissue|connective]], [[epithelial tissue|epithelial]], and [[neural tissue]]s. It is unique among glycosaminoglycans in that it is nonsulfated, forms in the [[plasma membrane]] instead of the [[Golgi apparatus]], and can be very large, with its [[molecular weight]] often reaching the millions.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Fraser JR, Laurent TC, Laurent UB |title=Hyaluronan: its nature, distribution, functions and turnover |journal=J.

One of the chief components of the [[extracellular matrix]], hyaluronan contributes significantly to cell proliferation and migration, and may also be involved in the progression of some malignant [[tumor]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stern|first=edited by Robert|title=Hyaluronan in cancer biology|year=2009|publisher=Academic Press/Elsevier|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=978-0-12-374178-3|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780123741783|edition=1st}}</ref>

== Physiological function ==
Until the late 1970s, hyaluronic acid was described as a "[[wikt:goo|goo]]" molecule, a ubiquitous carbohydrate polymer that is part of the extracellular matrix.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Toole BP | title = Hyaluronan is not just a goo! | journal = J. Clin. Invest. | volume = 106 | issue = 3 | pages = 335–336 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10930435 | pmc = 314333 | doi = 10.1172/JCI10706 | url = http://www.jci.org/articles/view/10706/pdf }}</ref>  For example, hyaluronic acid is a major component of the [[synovial fluid]], and was found to increase the viscosity of the fluid. Along with [[lubricin]], it is one of the fluid's main lubricating components.

Hyaluronic acid is an important component of articular [[cartilage]], where it is present as a coat around each cell ([[chondrocyte]]). When aggrecan monomers bind to hyaluronan in the presence of [[HAPLN1]] (hyaluronanic acid and proteoglycan link protein 1), large, highly negatively charged aggregates form.  These aggregates imbibe water and are responsible for the [[Resilience (materials science)|resilience]] of cartilage (its resistance to compression). The molecular weight (size) of hyaluronan in cartilage decreases with age, but the amount increases.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Holmes MW, Bayliss MT, Muir H | title = Hyaluronic acid in human articular cartilage. Age-related changes in content and size | journal = Biochem. J. | volume = 250 | issue = 2 | pages = 435–441 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3355532 | pmc = 1148875 | displayauthors = 1 }}</ref>

A lubricating role of hyaluronan in muscular connective tissues to enhance the sliding between adjacent tissue layers has been suggested. A particular type of fibroblasts, embedded in dense fascial tissues, has been proposed as being cells specialized for  the biosynthesis of the hyaluronan-rich matrix. Their related activity could be involved in regulating the sliding ability between adjacent muscular connective tissues.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Stecco C, Stern R, Porzionato A, Macchi V, Masiero S, Stecco A, De Caro R | year = 2011 | title = Hyaluronan within fascia in the etiology of myofascial pain | url = | journal = Surg Radiol Anat | volume = 33 | issue = 10| pages = 891–6 | doi = 10.1007/s00276-011-0876-9 }}</ref>

Hyaluronic acid is also a major component of skin, where it is involved in tissue repair. When skin is exposed to excessive [[UVB radiation|UVB rays]], it becomes inflamed ([[sunburn]]) and the [[Cell (biology)|cells]] in the dermis stop producing as much hyaluronan, and increase the rate of its degradation. Hyaluronan degradation products then accumulate in the skin after UV exposure.<ref name="pmid17082783">{{cite journal | vauthors = Averbeck M, Gebhardt CA, Voigt S, Beilharz S, Anderegg U, Termeer CC, Sleeman JP, Simon JC | title = Differential regulation of hyaluronan metabolism in the epidermal and dermal compartments of human skin by UVB irradiation | journal = J.

While it is abundant in extracellular matrices, hyaluronan also contributes to tissue hydrodynamics, movement and proliferation of cells, and participates in a number of cell surface receptor interactions, notably those including its primary receptors, [[CD44]] and [[RHAMM]]. Upregulation of CD44 itself is widely accepted as a marker of cell activation in lymphocytes.  Hyaluronan's contribution to tumor growth may be due to its interaction with CD44. Receptor CD44 participates in cell adhesion interactions required by tumor cells.

Although hyaluronan binds to receptor CD44, there is evidence hyaluronan degradation products transduce their inflammatory signal through [[toll-like receptor 2]] ([[TLR2]]), [[TLR4]], or both TLR2 and TLR4 in [[macrophages]] and [[dendritic cells]]. TLR and hyaluronan play a role in [[innate immunity]].

There are limitations including the in vivo loss of this compound limiting the duration of effect.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abate|first1=Michele|last2=Salini|first2=Vincenzo|title=Hyaluronic Acid in the Treatment of Osteoarthritis: What is New, Osteoarthritis - Diagnosis, Treatment and Surgery, Prof. Qian Chen (Ed.),|date=2012|publisher=InTech|location=Italy|isbn=978-953-51-0168-0|pages=102–114|url=http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs-wm/30684.pdf}}</ref><ref name="Synvisc-One (hylan GF-20) - P940015/S012"/>

=== Cancer ===

In some cancers, hyaluronic acid levels correlate well with malignancy and poor prognosis. Hyaluronic acid is, thus, often used as a [[tumor marker]] for [[prostate cancer|prostate]] and breast cancer. It may also be used to monitor the progression of the disease.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Josefsson A, Adamo H, Hammarsten P, Granfors T, Stattin P, Egevad L, Laurent AE, Wikström P, Bergh A | title = Prostate cancer increases hyaluronan in surrounding nonmalignant stroma, and this response is associated with tumor growth and an unfavorable outcome | journal = Am.

[[File:metastasis.jpeg|thumb|350px|Figure 1. The process of cancer metastasis in which HA-associated molecules play a role in the steps. Abbreviations: hyaluronic acid (HA), hyaluronic acid synthase (HAS), hyaluronic acid receptor (HAR), hyaluronidase (HAase/HYAL){{citation needed|date=March 2014}}]]
As shown in Figure 1, the various types of molecules that interact with hyaluronan can contribute to many of the stages of [[cancer metastasis]], i.e. further the spread of cancer.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Hyaluronic acid [[synthase]]s (HAS) play roles in all of the stages of cancer metastasis.  By producing anti-adhesive HA, HAS can allow tumor cells to release from the primary tumor mass, and if HA associates with receptors such as CD44, the activation of Rho GTPases can promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of the cancer cells. During the processes of intravasation or [[extravasation]], the interaction of HAS produced HA with receptors such as CD44 or RHAMM promote the cell changes that allow for the cancer cells to infiltrate the [[vascular]] or [[lymphatic]] systems. While traveling in these systems, HA produced by HAS protects the cancer cell from physical damage. Finally, in the formation of a metastatic lesion, HAS produces HA to allow the cancer cell to interact with native cells at the secondary site and to produce a tumor for itself.<ref name="pmid19218337">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bharadwaj AG, Kovar JL, Loughman E, Elowsky C, Oakley GG, Simpson MA | title = Spontaneous metastasis of prostate cancer is promoted by excess hyaluronan synthesis and processing | journal = Am.

=== Wound repair ===
Skin provides a mechanical barrier to the external environment and acts to prevent the ingress of infectious agents.<ref name="Kennedy J. F. 2002">Kennedy J. F., et al., HA, Volume 2 Biomedical, Medical and Clinical Aspects, 2002, Woodhead Publishing Limited.</ref> Once injured, the tissues beneath are exposed to infection; therefore, rapid and effective healing is of crucial significance to reconstruct a barrier function. Skin wound healing is a complex process, and includes many interacting processes initiated by haemostasis and the release of platelet-derived factors.<ref name="Kennndy J. F. 2002">Kennndy J. F., et al., HA, Volume 2 Biomedical, Medical and Clinical Aspects, 2002, Woodhead Publishing Limited.</ref> The following stages are inflammation, granulation tissue formation, reepithelization and remodeling. HA is likely to play a multifaceted role in mediation of these cellular and matrix events. The proposed roles of HA in this sequence of skin wound healing events are detailed below.

Hyaluronic acid has also been used in the synthesis of biological scaffolds for wound-healing applications. These scaffolds typically have proteins such as [[fibronectin]] attached to the hyaluronan to facilitate cell migration into the [[Wound healing|wound]]. This is particularly important for individuals with [[diabetes]] suffering from [[chronic wound]]s.<ref name="pmid14704979">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shu XZ, Ghosh K, Liu Y, Palumbo FS, Luo Y, Clark RA, Prestwich GD | title = Attachment and spreading of fibroblasts on an RGD peptide-modified injectable hyaluronan hydrogel | journal = J Biomed Mater Res A | volume = 68 | issue = 2 | pages = 365–75 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14704979 | doi = 10.1002/jbm.a.20002 }}</ref>

=== Inflammation ===
In the early inflammatory phase of wound repair, wounded tissue is abundant in HA, probably a reflection of increased synthesis.<ref name="Giovanni Abatangelo 1999"/> HA acts as a promoter of early inflammation, which is crucial in the whole skin wound-healing process. In a [[murine]] air pouch model of carrageenan/IL-1-induced inflammation, HA was observed to enhance cellular infiltration.<ref name="Giovanni Abatangelo 1999"/><ref name="pmid8568267">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wisniewski HG, Hua JC, Poppers DM, Naime D, Vilcek J, Cronstein BN | title = TNF/IL-1-inducible protein TSG-6 potentiates plasmin inhibition by inter-alpha-inhibitor and exerts a strong anti-inflammatory effect in vivo | journal = J.

It not only can promote the inflammation, as stated above, but also can moderate the inflammatory response, which may contribute to the stabilization of granulation tissue matrix, as described in the following part.

Although inflammation is an integral part of granulation tissue formation, for normal tissue repair to proceed, inflammation needs to be moderated. The initial granulation tissue formed is highly inflammatory with a high rate of tissue turnover mediated by matrix degrading enzymes and reactive oxygen metabolites that are products of inflammatory cells.<ref name="Giovanni Abatangelo 1999"/> Stabilization of granulation tissue matrix can be achieved by moderating inflammation. HA functions as an important moderator in this moderation process, which contradicts its role in inflammatory stimulation, as described above. HA can protect against free-radical damage to cells.<ref name="pmid2450149">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tammi R, Ripellino JA, Margolis RU, Tammi M | title = Localization of epidermal hyaluronic acid using the hyaluronate binding region of cartilage proteoglycan as a specific probe | journal = J.

In a rat model of free-radical scavenging property, HA has been shown to reduce damage to the granulation tissue.<ref name="pmid1966392">{{cite journal | vauthors = Foschi D, Castoldi L, Radaelli E, Abelli P, Calderini G, Rastrelli A, Mariscotti C, Marazzi M, Trabucchi E | title = Hyaluronic acid prevents oxygen free-radical damage to granulation tissue: a study in rats | journal = Int J Tissue React | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 333–9 | year = 1990 | pmid = 1966392 | doi = }}</ref>

In addition to the free-radical scavenging role, HA may also function in the negative [[feedback loop]] of inflammatory activation through its specific biological interactions with the biological constituents of inflammation.<ref name="Giovanni Abatangelo 1999"/> TNF-α, an important cytokine generated in inflammation, stimulates the expression of [[TSG-6]] (TNF-stimulated gene 6) in fibroblasts and inflammatory cells. TSG-6, a HA-binding protein, also forms a stable complex with the serum proteinase inhibitor IαI (Inter-α-inhibitor) with a synergistic effect on the latter’s plasmin-inhibitory activity. [[Plasmin]] is involved in activation of the [[Proteolysis|proteolytic]] cascade of matrix [[metalloproteinases]] and other [[proteinase]]s leading to inflammatory tissue damage. Therefore, the action of TSG-6/ IαI complex, which may be additionally organized by binding to HA in the extracellular matrix, may serve as a potent negative feedback loop to moderate inflammation and stabilize the granulation tissue as healing progresses.<ref name="Giovanni Abatangelo 1999"/><ref name="pmid9244409">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wisniewski HG, Vilcek J | title = TSG-6: an IL-1/TNF-inducible protein with anti-inflammatory activity | journal = Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 143–56 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9244409 | doi = 10.1016/s1359-6101(97)00008-7}}</ref> In the murine air pouch model of carragenan/IL-1 (Interleukin-1β)-induced inflammation, where HA has been shown to have a proinflammatory property, reduction of inflammation can be achieved by administrating TSG-6, and the result is comparable with systemic dexamethasone treatment.

=== Granulation ===
[[Granulation tissue]] is the [[Perfusion|perfused]], fibrous connective tissue that replaces a [[fibrin]] clot in healing wounds. It typically grows from the base of a wound and is able to fill wounds of almost any size it heals. HA is abundant in granulation tissue matrix. A variety of cell functions that are essential for tissue repair may attribute to this HA-rich network. These functions include facilitation of cell migration into the provisional wound matrix, cell proliferation and organization of the granulation tissue matrix.<ref name="Giovanni Abatangelo 1999"/> Initiation of inflammation is crucial for the formation of granulation tissue, therefore the pro-inflammatory role of HA as discussed above also contributes to this stage of wound healing.<ref name="Giovanni Abatangelo 1999"/>

=== Cell migration ===
Cell migration is essential for the formation of granulation tissue.<ref name="Giovanni Abatangelo 1999"/> The early stage of granulation tissue is dominated by a HA-rich extracellular matrix, which is regarded as a conducive environment for migration of cells into this temporary wound matrix. Contributions of HA to cell migration may attribute to its physicochemical properties as stated above, as well as its direct interactions with cells. For the former scenario, HA provides an open hydrated matrix that facilitates cell migration,<ref name="Giovanni Abatangelo 1999"/> whereas, in the latter scenario, directed migration and control of the cell locomotory mechanisms are mediated via the specific cell interaction between HA and cell surface HA receptors. As discussed before, the three principal cell surface receptors for HA are CD44, RHAMM, and ICAM-1. RHAMM is more related to cell migration. It forms links with several protein kinases associated with cell locomotion, for example, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), p125fak, and pp60c-src.<ref name="pmid1376732">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hardwick C, Hoare K, Owens R, Hohn HP, Hook M, Moore D, Cripps V, Austen L, Nance DM, Turley EA | title = Molecular cloning of a novel hyaluronan receptor that mediates tumor cell motility | journal = J.

=== Skin healing ===
HA plays an important role in the normal epidermis. HA also has crucial functions in the reepithelization process due to several of its properties. It serves as an integral part of the extracellular matrix of [[basal keratinocyte]]s, which are major constituents of the epidermis; its free-radical scavenging function and its role in keratinocyte proliferation and migration.<ref name="Giovanni Abatangelo 1999"/>

In normal skin, HA is found in relative high concentrations in the basal layer of the epidermis where proliferating keratinocytes are found.<ref name="Tammi R 1989">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tammi R, Ripellino JA, Margolis RU, Maibach HI, Tammi M | title = Hyaluronate accumulation in human epidermis treated with retinoic acid in skin organ culture | journal = J.

It has been suggested the free-radical scavenging property of HA contributes to protection against solar radiation, supporting the role of CD44 acting as a HA receptor in the epidermis.<ref name="Giovanni Abatangelo 1999"/>

Epidermal HA also functions as a manipulator in the process of keratinocyte proliferation, which is essential in normal epidermal function, as well as during reepithelization in tissue repair. In the wound healing process, HA is expressed in the wound margin, in the connective tissue matrix, and collocating with CD44 expression in migrating keratinocytes.<ref name="Giovanni Abatangelo 1999"/><ref name="KayaRodriguez1997"/> Kaya et al. found suppression of CD44 expression by an epidermis-specific [[antisense]] [[transgene]] resulted in animals with defective HA accumulation in the superficial dermis, accompanied by distinct morphologic alterations of basal keratinocytes and defective keratinocyte proliferation in response to [[mitogen]] and growth factors. Decrease in skin elasticity, impaired local inflammatory response, and impaired tissue repair were also observed.<ref name="Giovanni Abatangelo 1999"/> Their observations are strongly supportive of the important roles HA and CD44 have in skin physiology and tissue repair.<ref name="Giovanni Abatangelo 1999"/>

=== Fetal wound healing ===
Lack of [[scar|fibrous scarring]] is the primary feature of fetal wound healing. Even for longer periods, HA content in fetal wounds is still higher than that in adult wounds, which suggests that HA may, at least in part, reduce collagen deposition and therefore lead to reduced scarring.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Longaker MT, Chiu ES, Adzick NS, Stern M, Harrison MR, Stern R | title = Studies in fetal wound healing.

== Structure ==
Properties of hyaluronic acid were first determined in the 1930s in the laboratory of [[Karl Meyer (biochemist)|Karl Meyer]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Meyer K, Hobby GL, Chaffee E, Dawson MH | title = THE HYDROLYSIS OF HYALURONIC ACID BY BACTERIAL ENZYMES | journal = J.

Hyaluronic acid is a [[polymer]] of [[disaccharide]]s, themselves composed of [[Glucuronic acid|<small>D</small>-glucuronic acid]] and [[N-Acetylglucosamine|''N''-acetyl-<small>D</small>-glucosamine]], linked via alternating β-(1→4) and β-(1→3) [[glycosidic bond]]s. Hyaluronic acid can be 25,000 disaccharide repeats in length. Polymers of hyaluronic acid can range in size from 5,000 to 20,000,000 [[Atomic mass unit|Da]] ''in vivo''. The average molecular weight in human synovial fluid is 3–4 million Da, and hyaluronic acid purified from human [[umbilical cord]] is 3,140,000 Da.<ref name="pmid8406685">{{cite journal | vauthors = Saari H, Konttinen YT, Friman C, Sorsa T | title = Differential effects of reactive oxygen species on native synovial fluid and purified human umbilical cord hyaluronate | journal = Inflammation | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 403–15 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8406685 | doi = 10.1007/bf00916581}}</ref> Hyaluronic acid also contains Silicon, ranging between 350μg/g to 1900μg/g depending on location in the organism.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = A bound form of silicon in glycosaminoglycans and polyuronides|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date = 1973-05-01|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 433552|pmid = 4268099|pages = 1608–1612|volume = 70|issue = 5|first = K.|last = Schwarz|doi=10.1073/pnas.70.5.1608}}</ref>

Hyaluronic acid is energetically stable, in part because of the [[stereochemistry]] of its component disaccharides. Bulky groups on each sugar molecule are in sterically favored positions, whereas the smaller hydrogens assume the less-favorable axial positions.

== Biological synthesis ==
Hyaluronic acid is synthesized by a class of [[integral membrane protein]]s called [[hyaluronan synthase]]s, of which vertebrates have three types: [[HAS1]], [[HAS2]], and [[HAS3]]. These enzymes lengthen hyaluronan by repeatedly adding [[glucuronic acid]] and [[N-acetylglucosamine]] to the nascent polysaccharide as it is extruded via [[ABC-transporter]] through the [[cell membrane]] into the extracellular space.<ref name="pmid17540771">{{cite journal | vauthors = Schulz T, Schumacher U, Prehm P | title = Hyaluronan export by the ABC transporter MRP5 and its modulation by intracellular cGMP | journal = J.

Hyaluronic acid synthesis has been shown to be inhibited by 4-methylumbelliferone ([[hymecromone]], heparvit), a 7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin derivative.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kakizaki I, Kojima K, Takagaki K, Endo M, Kannagi R, Ito M, Maruo Y, Sato H, Yasuda T, Mita S, Kimata K, Itano N | title = A novel mechanism for the inhibition of hyaluronan biosynthesis by 4-methylumbelliferone | journal = J.

== Degradation ==
Hyaluronic acid can be degraded by a family of enzymes called [[hyaluronidase]]s. In humans, there are at least seven types of hyaluronidase-like enzymes, several of which are tumor suppressors. The degradation products of hyaluronan, the [[oligosaccharides]] and very low-molecular-weight hyaluronan, exhibit pro-[[angiogenic]] properties.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Matou-Nasri S, Gaffney J, Kumar S, Slevin M | title = Oligosaccharides of hyaluronan induce angiogenesis through distinct CD44 and RHAMM-mediated signalling pathways involving Cdc2 and gamma-adducin | journal = Int.

== Cell receptors for hyaluronic acid ==
So far, cell receptors that have been identified for HA fall into three main groups: CD44, Receptor for HA-mediated motility (RHAMM) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). CD44 and ICAM-1 were already known as cell adhesion molecules with other recognized ligands before their HA binding was discovered.<ref name="Wayne D. Comper 1996">Wayne D.

== Etymology ==
Hyaluronic acid is derived from ''hyalos'' (Greek for vitreous) and [[uronic acid]] because it was first isolated from the [[vitreous humour]] and possesses a high uronic acid content.

The term ''hyaluronate'' refers to the [[conjugate acid|conjugate base]] of hyaluronic acid. Because the molecule typically exists ''in vivo'' in its [[polyanionic]] form, it is most commonly referred to as ''hyaluronan''.

== History ==
The first hyaluronan biomedical product, Healon, was developed in the 1970s and 1980s by [[Pharmacia]], and approved for use in [[eye surgery]] (i.e., [[corneal transplantation]], cataract surgery, [[glaucoma]] surgery, and surgery to repair [[retinal detachment]]). Other biomedical companies also produce brands of hyaluronan for [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmic]] surgery.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In the late 1970s, intraocular lens implantation was often followed by severe [[corneal]] [[edema]], due to endothelial cell damage during the surgery. It was evident that a viscous, clear, physiologic lubricant to prevent such scraping of the endothelial cells was needed.<ref>1.

The name was changed to "hyaluronan" in 1986, because the polysaccharide synthesized by mammalian cells and certain species of microbes is a salt, not an acid. Since then, use of the name "hyaluronan" has become more prevalent.<ref>An Introduction to Biomaterials, Second Edition (Editor: Jeffrey O. Hollinger) 2011. John H. Brekke, Gregory E.

== Other animals ==
Hyaluronan is used in [[treatment of equine lameness#Intramuscular or intravenous joint therapies|treatment of articular disorders in horses]], in particular those in competition or heavy work. It is indicated for [[carpal]] and [[fetlock]] joint dysfunctions, but not when joint [[sepsis]] or fracture are suspected. It is especially used for [[synovitis]] associated with equine osteoarthritis. It can be injected directly into an affected joint, or intravenously for less localized disorders. It may cause mild heating of the joint if directly injected, but this does not affect the clinical outcome. Intra-articularly administered medicine is fully metabolized in less than a week.<ref>[http://www.genitrix.co.uk/2008datasheets/DS011_00HY-50.pdf Genitrix HY-50 Vet datasheet]</ref>

Due to its ability to regulate angiogenesis by stimulating endothelial cells to proliferate, hyaluronan can be used to create hydrogels to study vascular morphogenesis.<ref name="pmid18661325">{{cite journal | vauthors = Genasetti A, Vigetti D, Viola M, Karousou E, Moretto P, Rizzi M, Bartolini B, Clerici M, Pallotti F, De Luca G, Passi A | title = Hyaluronan and human endothelial cell behavior | journal = Connect.

For example, HA hydrogels are appealing for engineering vasculature from [[endothelial progenitor cell]]s by using appropriate growth factors such as [[VEGF]] and [[Ang-1]] to promote proliferation and vascular network formation.  Vacuole and lumen formation have been observed in these gels, followed by branching and sprouting through degradation of the hydrogel and finally complex network formation. The ability to generate vascular networks using HA hydrogels leads to opportunities for ''in vivo'' and clinical applications. One ''in vivo'' study, where HA hydrogels with endothelial colony forming cells were implanted into mice three days after hydrogel formation, saw evidence that the host and engineered vessels joined within 2 weeks of implantation, indicating viability and functionality of the engineered vasculature.<ref name="pmid21527523">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanjaya-Putra D, Bose V, Shen YI, Yee J, Khetan S, Fox-Talbot K, Steenbergen C, Burdick JA, Gerecht S | title = Controlled activation of morphogenesis to generate a functional human microvasculature in a synthetic matrix | journal = Blood | volume = 118 | issue = 3 | pages = 804–15 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21527523 | pmc = 3142913 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2010-12-327338 }}</ref>
