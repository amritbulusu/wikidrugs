Bapineuzumab is an antibody to the [[beta-amyloid]] (Aβ) plaques that are believed to underlie Alzheimer's disease neuropathology. In previous clinical trials for vaccination against human beta amyloid, called AN-1792, patients with Alzheimer's disease using [[active immunization]] had positive outcomes with removal of plaques, but 6% of subjects developed [[aseptic meningitis]] and the trial was stopped.<ref>{{cite journal
