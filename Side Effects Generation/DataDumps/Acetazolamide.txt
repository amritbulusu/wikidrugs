===High altitude sickness===
In the treatment of mountain sickness, acetazolamide forces the [[kidney]]s to excrete [[bicarbonate]], the [[conjugate base]] of [[carbonic acid]]. By increasing the amount of bicarbonate excreted in the urine, the blood becomes more acidic.<ref name="MD" /> As the body equates acidity of the blood to its CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, artificially acidifying the blood fools the body into thinking it has an excess of CO<sub>2</sub>, and it excretes this imaginary excess CO<sub>2</sub> by deeper and faster breathing, which in turn increases the amount of oxygen in the blood.<ref name="altorg">{{cite web |title=Altitude.org |year=2004 |url=http://www.altitude.org |accessdate=2009-06-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Leaf DE, Goldfarb DS |title=Mechanisms of action of acetazolamide in the prophylaxis and treatment of acute mountain sickness |journal=J.

===Pregnancy and lactation===
Acetazolamide is pregnancy category B3 in Australia, which means that studies in rats, mice and rabbits in which acetazolamide was given intravenously or orally caused an increased risk of fetal malformations, including defects of the limbs.<ref name = TGA/> Despite this there is insufficient evidence from studies in humans to either support or discount this evidence.<ref name = TGA/>

Limited data are available on the effects of nursing mothers taking acetazolamide. Therapeutic doses create low levels in breast milk and are not expected to cause problems in infants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search2/r?dbs+lactmed:@term+@DOCNO+489|publisher=[[National Institutes of Health]]|title=LactMed: Acetazolamide|accessdate=2017-10-10}}</ref>

==Side effects==
Common adverse effects of acetazolamide include the following: [[paraesthesia]], fatigue, drowsiness, depression, decreased libido, bitter or metallic taste, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, black feces, [[polyuria]], [[kidney stones]], [[metabolic acidosis]] and electrolyte changes ([[hypokalemia]], [[hyponatremia]]).<ref name="AMH">{{cite book | editor = Rossi, S | isbn = 978-0-9805790-9-3 | title = Australian Medicines Handbook | place = Adelaide | publisher = The Australian Medicines Handbook Unit Trust | year = 2013 | edition = 2013 }}</ref> Whereas less common adverse effects include [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]], [[anaphylaxis]] and blood dyscrasias.<ref name = AMH/>

* Hyperchloremic acidosis
* [[Hypokalemia]] (low blood potassium)
* [[Hyponatremia]] (low blood sodium)
* [[Adrenal insufficiency]] 
* Impaired kidney function
* Hypersensitivity to acetazolamide or other sulfonamides. 
* Marked liver disease or impairment of liver function, including cirrhosis because of the risk of development of hepatic encephalopathy. Acetazolamide decreases ammonia clearance.

===Interactions===
It is possible that it might interact with:<ref name = TGA/>
* [[Amphetamine]]s, due to the fact it increases the pH of the renal tubular urine, hence reducing the clearance of amphetamines.
* Other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors — potential for additive inhibitory effects on carbonic anhydrase and hence potential for toxicity. 
* [[Ciclosporin]], may increase plasma levels of ciclosporin.
* [[Antifolate]]s such as [[trimethoprim]], [[methotrexate]], [[pemetrexed]] and [[raltitrexed]].
* [[Hypoglycemic]]s, acetazolamide can both increase or decrease blood glucose levels.
* [[Lithium (medication)|Lithium]], increases excretion, hence reducing therapeutic effect.
* [[Methenamine]] compounds, reduces the urinary excretion of methenamines.
* [[Phenytoin]], reduces phenytoin excretion, hence increasing the potential for toxicity.
* [[Primidone]], reduces plasma levels of primidone. Hence reducing anticonvulsant effect.
* [[Quinidine]], reduces urinary excretion of quinidine, hence increasing the potential for toxicity.
* [[Salicylates]], potential for severe toxicity.
* [[Sodium bicarbonate]], potential for kidney stone formation.
* [[Anticoagulants]], [[cardiac glycosides]], may have their effects potentiated by acetazolamide.

:<ce>{H2CO3} <=> {HCO3^-} + {H+}</ce>

which has a [[Acid dissociation constant|pK<sub>a</sub>]] of 6.3.<ref name = chem>{{cite web|title=Carbonic Anhydrase 2|work=UC Davis Chemwiki|publisher=University of California|author=Larsen, D|accessdate=10 April 2014|url=http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/@api/deki/pages/2479/pdf?stylesheet=default&deep=false&showtoc=false}}</ref>

The mechanism of diuresis involves the proximal tubule of the kidney. The enzyme carbonic anhydrase is found here, allowing the reabsorption of bicarbonate, sodium, and chloride. By inhibiting this enzyme, these ions are excreted, along with excess water, lowering blood pressure, intracranial pressure, and intraocular pressure. By excreting bicarbonate, the blood becomes acidic, causing compensatory hyperventilation with deep respiration (Kussmaul respiration), increasing levels of oxygen and decreasing levels of carbon dioxide in the blood.<ref>http://www.life.illinois.edu/ib/426/handouts/Diamox%20mechanism_review_2007.pdf</ref>

In the eye this results in a reduction in [[aqueous humour]].<ref name="TGA" />

Bicarbonate ({{Chem|HCO|3|−}}) has a pK<sub>a</sub> of 10.3 with carbonate ({{Chem|CO|3|−}}), far further from physiologic pH (7.35–7.45), and so it is more likely to accept a proton than to donate one, but it is also far less likely for it to do either, thus bicarbonate will be the major species at physiological pH.

Under normal conditions in the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney, most of the carbonic acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) produced intracellularly by the action of carbonic anhydrase quickly dissociates in the cell to [[bicarbonate]] ({{Chem|HCO|3|−}}) and an {{Chem|H||+}} ion (a [[proton]]), as previously mentioned. The bicarbonate ({{Chem|HCO|3|−}}) exits at the basal portion of the cell via sodium ({{Chem|Na||+}}) symport and chloride ({{Chem|Cl||−}}) antiport and re-enters circulation, where it may accept a proton if blood pH decreases, thus acting as a weak, basic buffer. The remaining {{Chem|H||+}} left over from the intracellular production of carbonic acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) exits the apical (urinary lumen) portion of the cell by {{Chem|Na||+}} antiport, acidifying the urine. There, it may join with another bicarbonate ({{Chem|HCO|3|−}}) that dissociated from its {{Chem|H||+}} in the lumen of the urinary space only after exiting the proximal convoluted kidney cells/glomerulus as carbonic acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) because bicarbonate ({{Chem|HCO|3|−}}) itself can not diffuse across the cell membrane in its polar state. This will replenish carbonic acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) so that it then may be reabsorbed into the cell as itself or CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O (produced via a luminal carbonic anhydrase). As a result of this whole process, there is a greater net balance of {{Chem|H||+}} in the urinary lumen than bicarbonate ({{Chem|HCO|3|−}}), and so this space is more acidic than physiologic pH. Thus, there is an increased likelihood that any bicarbonate ({{Chem|HCO|3|−}}) that was left over in the lumen diffuses back into the cell as carbonic acid, {{Chem|CO|2}}, or H<sub>2</sub>O.

In short, under normal conditions, the net effect of carbonic anhydrase in the urinary lumen and cells of the proximal convoluted tubule is to acidify the urine and transport bicarbonate ({{Chem|HCO|3|−}}) into the body. Another effect is excretion of {{Chem|Cl||−}} as it is needed to maintain electroneutrality in the lumen, as well as the reabsorption of {{Chem|Na||+}} into the body.

Thus, by disrupting this process with acetazolamide, urinary {{Chem|Na||+}} and bicarbonate ({{Chem|HCO|3|−}}) are increased, and urinary {{Chem|H||+}} and {{Chem|Cl||−}} are decreased. Inversely, serum {{Chem|Na||+}} and bicarbonate ({{Chem|HCO|3|−}}) are decreased, and serum {{Chem|H||+}} and {{Chem|Cl||−}} are increased. H<sub>2</sub>O generally follows sodium, and so this is how the clinical diuretic effect is achieved, which reduces blood volume and thus preload on the heart to improve contractility and reduce blood pressure, or achieve other desired clinical effects of reduced blood volume such as reducing edema or intracranial pressure.<ref>Koeppen BM.
