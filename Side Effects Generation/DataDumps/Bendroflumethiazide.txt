'''Bendroflumethiazide''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]), formerly '''bendrofluazide''' ([[British Approved Name|BAN]]), trade name '''Aprinox''', is a [[thiazide]] [[diuretic]] used to treat [[hypertension]].

Bendroflumethiazide is a thiazide diuretic which works by inhibiting sodium reabsorption at the beginning of the [[distal convoluted tubule]] (DCT). Water is lost as a result of more sodium reaching the collecting ducts. Bendroflumethiazide has a role in the treatment of mild [[heart failure]] although [[loop diuretic]]s are better for reducing overload. The main use of bendroflumethiazide currently is in hypertension (part of the effect is due to [[vasodilation]]).

==Adverse effects==

Rare adverse effects:<ref>[http://www.drugs.com/sfx/bendroflumethiazide-side-effects.html Bendroflumethiazide Side Effects] Drugs.com</ref>

=== Alcohol ===
Bendroflumethiazide is known to have an adverse interaction with alcohol. It is advised that those using this diuretic should abstain from alcohol consumption during use, as it is possible to experience a sudden drop in blood pressure, especially if standing up.

=== Other considerations ===
Bendroflumethiazide should not be used by pregnant women, or women who have just given birth. Due to the nature of the medication, it is possible for it to pass into the breast milk and consequently to the child. It is also known that bendroflumethiazide suppresses the production of breast milk. Pregnant or lactating women with hypertension may need to discuss with their prescriber as to which alternative treatment may be more suitable. Bendroflumethiazide may also impair the user's motor skills, therefore it is important to be aware of its effects and to take caution when operating machinery of driving.<ref>[http://www.nhs.uk/medicine-guides/pages/MedicineOverview.aspx?condition=High%20blood%20pressure&medicine=bendroflumethiazide Bendroflumethiazide (Bendroflumethiazide 2.5mg tablets)] NHS.uk {{Dead link |date=November 2015}}</ref>
