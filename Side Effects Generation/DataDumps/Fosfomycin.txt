'''Fosfomycin''' (also known as '''phosphomycin''' or '''phosphonomycin''' and the trade names '''Monurol''' and '''Monuril''') is a [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]]<ref name="pmid11481290">{{cite journal | vauthors = Grif K, Dierich MP, Pfaller K, Miglioli PA, Allerberger F | title = In vitro activity of fosfomycin in combination with various antistaphylococcal substances | journal = The Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy | volume = 48 | issue = 2 | pages = 209–17 | date = Aug 2001 | pmid = 11481290 | doi = 10.1093/jac/48.2.209 | url = http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11481290 }}</ref> produced by certain ''[[Streptomyces]]'' species, although it can now be made by chemical synthesis.

As a single dose, fosfomycin is more convenient than a multiple-dose therapy [[norfloxacin]], for the same antibacterial efficacy.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Single-dose fosfomycin trometamol (Monuril) versus multiple-dose norfloxacin: results of a multicenter study in females with uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections. |author=de Jong Z1, Pontonnier F, Plante P. |pmid=1926651 | volume=46 |journal=Urol Int |pages=344–8 |doi=10.1159/000282164}}</ref>

==History==
Fosfomycin (originally known as phosphonomycin) was discovered in a joint effort of [[Merck and Co.]] and Spain's Compañía Española de Penicilina y Antibióticos (CEPA).  It was first isolated by screening broth cultures of ''[[Streptomyces fradiae]]'' isolated from soil samples for the ability to cause formation of [[spheroplasts]] by growing bacteria.  The discovery was described in a series of papers published in 1969.<ref>Silver, L.L. Rational approaches to antibiotic discovery: pre-genomic directed and phenotypic screening, 2.4.2 Screens for spheroplast formation. In:  Thomas Dougherty, Michael J. Pucci, ''Antibiotic Discovery and Development.'' Chap. 2, p. 46.</ref> CEPA began producing fosfomycin on an industrial scale in 1971 at its [[Aranjuez]] facility.<ref>Encros [http://www.ercros.es/eng/internas.asp?arxiu=qh_aranjuezh About us: Our history.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914142734/http://www.ercros.es/eng/internas.asp?arxiu=qh_aranjuezh |date=2011-09-14 }}</ref>

==Uses==
Fosfomycin is indicated in the treatment of [[urinary tract infection]]s (UTIs), where it is usually administered as a single oral megadose.<ref name="pmid9098664">{{cite journal | vauthors = Patel SS, Balfour JA, Bryson HM | title = Fosfomycin tromethamine.

The drug is well tolerated and has a low incidence of harmful side effects.<ref name="pmid9098664"/> However, development of bacterial resistance under therapy is a frequent occurrence and makes fosfomycin unsuitable for sustained therapy of severe infections. It is not recommended for children and those over 75 years old.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drugs.com/uk/monuril-sachets-3g-leaflet.html |title=MONURIL SACHETS 3G |accessdate=May 26, 2014}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==

Fosfomycin is bactericidal and inhibits bacterial cell wall biogenesis by inactivating the enzyme [[UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase|UDP-''N''-acetylglucosamine-3-enolpyruvyltransferase]], also known as MurA.<ref name="Brown">{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown ED, Vivas EI, Walsh CT, Kolter R | title = MurA (MurZ), the enzyme that catalyzes the first committed step in peptidoglycan biosynthesis, is essential in Escherichia coli | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 177 | issue = 14 | pages = 4194–7 | date = Jul 1995 | pmid = 7608103 | pmc = 177162 }}</ref> This enzyme catalyzes the [[committed step]] in [[peptidoglycan]] biosynthesis, namely the ligation of [[phosphoenolpyruvate]] (PEP) to the 3'-hydroxyl group of [[Uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine|UDP-''N''-acetylglucosamine]]. This pyruvate moiety provides the linker that bridges the glycan and peptide portion of peptidoglycan. Fosfomycin is a PEP analog that inhibits MurA by [[alkylation|alkylating]] an active site [[cysteine]] residue (Cys 115 in the ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' enzyme).<ref name="urlCell Envelope.1995">{{cite web |url=http://www.micro.siu.edu/micr425/425Notes/02-CellEnv.html |title=Cell Envelope.1995 |work= |accessdate=2008-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330140157/http://www.micro.siu.edu/micr425/425Notes/02-CellEnv.html |archivedate=2009-03-30 |df= }}</ref>

Fosfomycin enters the bacterial cell through the glycerophosphate transporter.<ref name="santoro">{{cite journal | vauthors = Santoro A, Cappello AR, Madeo M, Martello E, Iacopetta D, Dolce V | title = Interaction of fosfomycin with the glycerol 3-phosphate transporter of Escherichia coli. | journal =  Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1810 | issue = 12 | pages = 1323–1329| date = Jul 2011 | pmid = 21791237| doi =10.1016/j.bbagen.2011.07.006}}</ref>

==Antibacterial spectrum and susceptibility==
The fosfomycin molecule has an [[epoxide]] or oxirane ring, which is highly [[ring strain|strained]] and thus very reactive.

Fosfomycin has broad antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, with useful activity against ''E. faecalis'', ''E. coli'', and various Gram-negatives such as '' Citrobacter'' and ''Proteus''.  Given a greater activity in a low-pH milieu, and predominant excretion in active form into the urine, fosfomycin has found use for the prophylaxis and treatment of UTIs caused by these uropathogens.  Of note, activity against ''S. saprophyticus'', ''Klebsiella'', and ''Enterobacter'' is variable and should be confirmed by [[minimum inhibitory concentration]] testing. 
Activity against [[Beta-lactamase#Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase .28ESBL.29|extended-spectrum β-lactamase]]-producing pathogens, notably ESBL-producing ''E. coli'', is good to excellent, because the drug is not affected by cross-resistance issues.
Existing clinical data support use in uncomplicated UTIs, caused by susceptible organisms.  However, susceptibility break-points of 64&nbsp;mg/l should not be applied for systemic infections.

==Biosynthetic gene cluster==
The complete fosfomycin biosynthetic [[gene cluster]] from ''Streptomyces fradiae'' has been cloned and sequenced and the heterologous production of fosfomycin in ''S. lividans'' has been achieved by Ryan Woodyer of the [[Huimin Zhao]] and Wilfred van der Donk research groups.<ref name="pmid17113999">{{cite journal | vauthors = Woodyer RD, Shao Z, Thomas PM, Kelleher NL, Blodgett JA, Metcalf WW, van der Donk WA, Zhao H | title = Heterologous production of fosfomycin and identification of the minimal biosynthetic gene cluster | journal = Chemistry & Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 11 | pages = 1171–82 | date = Nov 2006 | pmid = 17113999 | doi = 10.1016/j.chembiol.2006.09.007 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1074-5521(06)00340-1 }}</ref>

==Resistance==
Mutations that inactivate the nonessential glycerophosphate transporter render bacteria resistant to fosfomycin.<ref name="navas">{{cite journal |vauthors=Navas J, León J, Arroyo M, García Lobo JM |title=Nucleotide sequence and intracellular location of the product of the fosfomycin resistance gene from transposon Tn2921 |journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy |volume=34 |issue=10 |pages=2016–8 |year=1990 |pmid=1963292 |pmc=171982 |doi=10.1128/AAC.34.10.2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kahan FM, Kahan JS, Cassidy PJ, Kropp H |title=The mechanism of action of fosfomycin (phosphonomycin) |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=235 |issue= |pages=364–86 |year=1974 |pmid=4605290 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1974.tb43277.x |bibcode=1974NYASA.235..364K }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Castañeda-García A, Blázquez J, Rodríguez-Rojas A |title=Molecular Mechanisms and Clinical Impact of Acquired and Intrinsic Fosfomycin Resistance |journal=Antibiotics |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=217–36 |year=2013 |pmid=27029300 |pmc=4790336 |doi=10.3390/antibiotics2020217 }}</ref>

===Fosfomycin resistance enzymes===
[[Enzyme]]s conferring resistance to fosfomycin have also been identified and are encoded both [[chromosome|chromosomally]] and on [[plasmid]]s.<ref name="rigsby">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rigsby RE, Fillgrove KL, Beihoffer LA, Armstrong RN | title = Fosfomycin resistance proteins: a nexus of glutathione transferases and epoxide hydrolases in a metalloenzyme superfamily | journal = Methods in Enzymology | volume = 401 | pages = 367–379 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16399398 | doi = 10.1016/S0076-6879(05)01023-2 | chapter = Fosfomycin Resistance Proteins: A Nexus of Glutathione Transferases and Epoxide Hydrolases in a Metalloenzyme Superfamily | isbn = 9780121828066 | series = Methods in Enzymology }}</ref>

Three related fosfomycin resistance enzymes (named FosA, FosB, and FosX) are members of the [[Lactoylglutathione lyase#Structure|glyoxalase]] superfamily. These enzymes function by nucleophilic attack on carbon 1 of fosfomycin, which opens the epoxide ring and renders the drug ineffective. The enzymes differ by the identity of the nucleophile used in the reaction: [[glutathione]] for FosA, [[bacillithiol]] for FosB,<ref name="pmid21751306">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharma SV, Jothivasan VK, Newton GL, Upton H, Wakabayashi JI, Kane MG, Roberts AA, Rawat M, La Clair JJ, Hamilton CJ | title = Chemical and Chemoenzymatic syntheses of bacillithiol: a unique low-molecular-weight thiol amongst low G + C Gram-positive bacteria | journal = Angewandte Chemie | volume = 50 | issue = 31 | pages = 7101–7104 | date = Jul 2011 | pmid = 21751306 | doi = 10.1002/anie.201100196 }}</ref><ref name="pmid23256780">{{cite journal | vauthors = Roberts AA, Sharma SV, Strankman AW, Duran SR, Rawat M, Hamilton CJ | title = Mechanistic studies of FosB: a divalent-metal-dependent bacillithiol-S-transferase that mediates fosfomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus | journal = The Biochemical Journal | volume = 451 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–79 | date = Apr 2013 | pmid = 23256780 | doi = 10.1042/BJ20121541 | pmc=3960972}}</ref> and water for FosX.<ref name="rigsby" /> In general, FosA and FosX enzymes are produced by Gram-negative bacteria, whereas FosB is produced by Gram-positive bacteria.<ref name="rigsby" />
