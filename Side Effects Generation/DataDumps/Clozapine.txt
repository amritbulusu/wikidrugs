==Medical uses==
Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug primarily used in people who are unresponsive to or intolerant of other antipsychotics.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Essali|first1=A|last2=Al-Haj Haasan|first2=N|last3=Li|first3=C|last4=Rathbone|first4=J|title=Clozapine versus typical neuroleptic medication for schizophrenia.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=21 January 2009|issue=1|pages=CD000059|pmid=19160174}}</ref> This means that they have failed to respond satisfactorily to at least two different antipsychotics.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Meltzer HY | title = Treatment-resistant schizophrenia--the role of clozapine | journal = Current Medical Research and Opinion | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–20 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9524789 | doi = 10.1185/03007999709113338 }}</ref> It has been shown to be more effective in reducing symptoms of schizophrenia than [[typical antipsychotics]], with more pronounced effects in those who have responded poorly to other medication.<ref name=Lancet2013/>

In a 2013 study in a comparison of 15 antipsychotic drugs in effectiveness in treating schizophrenic symptoms, clozapine was ranked first, demonstrating very high effectiveness. 25% more effective than [[amisulpride]] (2nd), 33% more effective than [[olanzapine]] (3rd), and twice as effective as [[haloperidol]], [[quetiapine]], and [[aripiprazole]].<ref name=Lancet2013/>

The effect of clozapine, however, is, at least, in the short term, not reflected in measures of global functioning such as ability to leave the hospital and maintain an occupation. The relapse rate is lower and patient acceptability is better.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Essali|first1=A|last2=Al-Haj Haasan|first2=N|last3=Li|first3=C|last4=Rathbone|first4=J|title=Clozapine versus typical neuroleptic medication for schizophrenia.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=21 January 2009|issue=1|pages=CD000059|pmid=19160174}}</ref> There is some evidence clozapine may reduce propensity for substance abuse in schizophrenic patients.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee M, Dickson RA, Campbell M, Oliphant J, Gretton H, Dalby JT |title = Clozapine and substance abuse in patients with schizophrenia |journal = Canadian Journal of Psychiatry |volume = 43 |pages = 855–856 |year = 1998 }}</ref>

It may be better than other antipsychotics in people with both [[schizophrenia]] and [[Parkinson's disease]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://asp.cumc.columbia.edu/psych/asktheexperts/ask_the_experts_inquiry.asp?SI=146 |title=How would you treat someone who has both schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease? |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211053108/http://asp.cumc.columbia.edu/psych/asktheexperts/ask_the_experts_inquiry.asp?SI=146 |archivedate=2013-12-11 |df= }}</ref>

Clozapine is not recommended for the treatment of behavior problems in older adults with dementia.

==Side effects==
Clozapine may cause side effects. Some are serious and potentially fatal. Common side effects include [[constipation]], bed-wetting, night-time [[drooling]], [[muscle stiffness]], [[sedation]], [[tremor]]s, [[orthostatic hypotension]], hyperglycemia, and [[weight gain]]. The risk of developing [[extrapyramidal symptoms]] such as tardive dyskinesia is below that of typical antipsychotics; this may be due to clozapine's anticholinergic effects. Extrapyramidal symptoms may subside somewhat after a person switches from another antipsychotic to clozapine.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/site/pharmacologymcqs/clozapine-clozaril |title=Clozapine |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110214051/https://sites.google.com/site/pharmacologymcqs/clozapine-clozaril |archivedate=2013-11-10 |df= }}</ref>

Clozapine also carries five black box warnings, including warnings for agranulocytosis, [[central nervous system depression]], [[leukopenia]], [[neutropenia]], seizure disorder, [[bone marrow suppression]], dementia, hypotension, myocarditis, [[orthostatic hypotension]] (with or without [[syncope (medicine)|syncope]]) and seizures.<ref>http://www.clinicalpharmacology-ip.com/Forms/Monograph/monograph.aspx?cpnum=142&sec=monadve</ref> Lowering of the [[seizure threshold]] may be dose related and slow initial titration of dose may decrease the risk for precipitating seizures. Slow titration of dosing may also decrease the risk for orthostatic hypotension and other adverse cardiovascular side effects.<ref name="MCQ">{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/pharmacologymcqs/clozapine-clozaril|title=Clozapine|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110214051/https://sites.google.com/site/pharmacologymcqs/clozapine-clozaril|archivedate=2013-11-10|df=}}</ref>

Many male patients have experienced cessation of [[ejaculation]] during [[orgasm]] as a side effect of clozapine, though this is not documented in official drug guides.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggaley M | title = Sexual dysfunction in schizophrenia: focus on recent evidence | journal = Human Psychopharmacology | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 201–209 | date = Apr 2008 | pmid = 18338766 | pmc = | doi = 10.1002/hup.924 }}</ref>

However, many side-effects can be managed and do not necessarily warrant discontinuation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nielsen J, Correll CU, Manu P, Kane JM | title = Termination of clozapine treatment due to medical reasons: when is it warranted and how can it be avoided? | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 74 | issue = 6 | pages = 603–13 | date = Jun 2013 | pmid = 23842012 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.12r08064 }}</ref>

===Agranulocytosis===
{{main|Agranulocytosis}}
Clozapine carries a black box warning for drug-induced agranulocytosis. Without monitoring, agranulocytosis occurs in about 1% of people who take clozapine during the first few months of treatment;<ref name="GoodmanGilman">{{cite book |last=Baldessarini |first=Ross J. |author2=Frank I.

===Cardiac toxicity===
Myocarditis is a sometimes fatal side effect of clozapine, which usually develops within the first month of commencement.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Haas SJ, Hill R, Krum H, Liew D, Tonkin A, Demos L, Stephan K, McNeil J | title = Clozapine-associated myocarditis: a review of 116 cases of suspected myocarditis associated with the use of clozapine in Australia during 1993-2003 | journal = Drug Safety | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–57 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17194170 | doi = 10.2165/00002018-200730010-00005 }}</ref> First manifestations of illness are fever which may be accompanied by symptoms associated with upper respiratory tract, gastrointestinal or urinary tract infection. Typically [[C-reactive protein]] (CRP) increases with the onset of fever and rises in the cardiac enzyme, [[troponin]], occur up to 5 days later.

===Gastrointestinal hypomotility===
Another underrecognized and potentially life-threatening side effect spectrum is gastrointestinal hypomotility, which may manifest as severe [[constipation]], [[fecal impaction]], paralytic [[ileus]], [[bowel obstruction]], acute megacolon, [[ischemia]] or [[necrosis]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Palmer SE, McLean RM, Ellis PM, Harrison-Woolrych M | title = Life-threatening clozapine-induced gastrointestinal hypomotility: an analysis of 102 cases | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 69 | issue = 5 | pages = 759–768 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18452342 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.v69n0509 }}</ref> Colonic hypomotility has been shown to occur in up to 80% of people prescribed clozapine when [[gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] function is measured objectively using [[radiopaque]] markers.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Every-Palmer S, Nowitz M, Stanley J, Grant E, Huthwaite M, Dunn H, Ellis, PM | title = Clozapine-treated patients have marked gastrointestinal hypomotility, the probable basis of life-threatening gastrointestinal complications: a cross sectional study | journal = EBioMedicine | volume = 5 | pages = 125–134 | date = March 2016 | doi = 10.1016/j.ebiom.2016.02.020 }}</ref> Clozapine-induced gastrointestinal hypomotility currently has a higher mortality rate than the better known side effect of agranulocytosis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen D, Bogers JP, van Dijk D, Bakker B, Schulte PF | title = Beyond white blood cell monitoring: screening in the initial phase of clozapine therapy | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 73 | issue = 10 | pages = 1307–1312 | date = 2012 | pmid = 23140648 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.11r06977 }}</ref> A [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane review]] found little evidence to help guide decisions about the best treatment for gastrointestinal hypomotility caused by clozapine and other [[antipsychotic]] medication.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Every-Palmer S, Newton-Howes G, Clarke MJ | title = Pharmacological treatment for antipsychotic | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 1 | date = 24 January 2017 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD011128.pub2}}</ref> Monitoring bowel function and the preemptive use of [[laxative]]s for all clozapine-treated people has been shown to improve colonic transit times and reduce serious sequelae.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Every-Palmer S, Ellis PM, Nowitz M, Stanley J, Grant E, Huthwaite M, Dunn H | title = The Porirua Protocol in the treatment of clozapine-induced gastrointestinal hypomotility and constipation: A pre- and post-treatment study | journal = CNS Drugs | volume = 31 | issue = 1 |pages = 75–85 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27826741| doi = 10.1007/s40263-016-0391-y }}</ref>

===Hypersalivation===
While clozapine is a [[muscarinic]] antagonist at the [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1|M1]], [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2|M2]], [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3|M3]], and [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M5|M5]] receptors, clozapine is a full agonist at the [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M4|M4]] subset. Because M4 is highly expressed in the [[salivary gland]], its M4 agonist activity is thought to be responsible for the hypersalivation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/409612_2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209042338/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/409612_2 |archivedate=2012-02-09 |df= }}</ref>

===Withdrawal effects===

===Pharmacokinetics===
[[File:Desmethylclozapine.svg|thumb|150px|left|''N''-[[desmethylclozapine]] (norclozapine), clozapine's major active metabolite.]]

The absorption of clozapine is almost complete, but the oral [[bioavailability]] is only 60 to 70% due to [[first-pass metabolism]]. The time to peak concentration after oral dosing is about 2.5 hours, and food does not appear to affect the bioavailability of clozapine.
The [[elimination half-life]] of clozapine is about 14 hours at [[steady state]] conditions (varying with daily dose).

Clozapine is extensively metabolized in the liver, via the [[cytochrome P450]] system, to [[Chemical polarity|polar]] metabolites suitable for elimination in the urine and feces. The major metabolite, ''norclozapine'' ([[demethylation|desmethyl]]-clozapine), is pharmacologically active. The cytochrome P450 [[isoenzyme]] [[CYP1A2|1A2]] is primarily responsible for clozapine metabolism, but 2C, [[CYP2D6|2D6]], [[CYP2E1|2E1]] and [[CYP3A4|3A3/4]] appear to play roles as well. Agents that [[enzyme induction and inhibition|induce]] (e.g., cigarette smoke) or [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibit]] (e.g., [[theophylline]], [[ciprofloxacin]], [[fluvoxamine]]) CYP1A2 may increase or decrease, respectively, the metabolism of clozapine. For example, the induction of metabolism caused by smoking means that smokers require up to double the dose of clozapine compared with non-smokers to achieve an equivalent plasma concentration.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rostami-Hodjegan A, Amin AM, Spencer EP, Lennard MS, Tucker GT, Flanagan RJ | title = Influence of dose, cigarette smoking, age, sex, and metabolic activity on plasma clozapine concentrations: a predictive model and nomograms to aid clozapine dose adjustment and to assess compliance in individual patients | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 70–8 | date = Feb 2004 | pmid = 14709950 | doi = 10.1097/01.jcp.0000106221.36344.4d }}</ref>

==History==
Clozapine was synthesized in 1958 by Wander AG, a Swiss pharmaceutical company, based on the chemical structure of the tricyclic antidepressant [[imipramine]]. The first test in humans in 1962 was considered a failure. Trials in Germany in 1965 and 1966 as well as a trial in Vienna in 1966 were successful. In 1967 Wander AG was acquired by [[Sandoz Laboratories|Sandoz]].<ref name=Cri2007 /> Further trials took place in 1972 when clozapine was released in Switzerland and Austria as Leponex. Two years later it was released in West Germany, and Finland in 1975. Early testing was performed in the United States around the same time.<ref name="Crilly">{{cite journal | vauthors = Crilly J | title = The history of clozapine and its emergence in the US market: a review and analysis | journal = History of Psychiatry | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 39–60 | date = Mar 2007 | pmid = 17580753 | doi = 10.1177/0957154X07070335 }}</ref><!-- cites previous three sentences --> In 1975, after reports of [[agranulocytosis]] leading to death in some clozapine-treated patients, clozapine was voluntarily withdrawn by the manufacturer.<ref>{{cite book |author=Healy, David |title=The Creation of Psychopharmacology |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2004 |pages=238–42 |isbn=0-674-01599-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6O2rPJnyhj0C}}</ref> Clozapine fell out of favor for more than a decade despite unclear reasons for the agranulocytosis which occurred in Finland, the rate of which was 20 times higher<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Griffith|first=R.W.|last2=Saameli|first2=K.|title=CLOZAPINE AND AGRANULOCYTOSIS|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S014067367590135X|journal=The Lancet|volume=306|issue=7936|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(75)90135-x|pages=657|year=1975}}</ref> than had been reported in any other country. However, when studies demonstrated that clozapine was more effective against treatment-resistant [[schizophrenia]] than other [[antipsychotics]], the FDA and health authorities in most other countries approved its use only for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and required Restricted Distribution, a Patient Registry and regular [[hematological]] monitoring to detect [[granulocytopenia]], before [[agranulocytosis]] develops.
