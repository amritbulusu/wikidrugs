'''TCN''' is the [[Sydney]] [[flagship (television)|flagship]] [[television station]] of the [[Nine Network]] in [[Australia]] and is located at [[Willoughby, New South Wales|Willoughby]]. The licence, issued to a company named Television Corporation Ltd headed by [[Frank Packer|Sir Frank Packer]], was one of the first four licences (two in Sydney, two in Melbourne) to be issued for commercial television stations in Australia. TCN-9 is the home of the NRL coverage and national-level Nine News bulletins.

==History==
TCN began broadcasting on 16 September 1956, and became the first station in Australia to begin regular transmissions. Test broadcasts, initially consisting of a test slide and later documentaries and dramas, had commenced two months earlier on 13 July 1956.<ref>"First test broadcast by TCN".

The first words spoken on the station were by John Godson, who introduced the station audio-only,<ref name="Original Voice">{{cite news

}}</ref> shortly before the first program, ''This Is Television'', was introduced by [[Bruce Gyngell]]. As Godson's voice only was heard, Gyngell (who spoke and was seen) is regarded as the first person to "appear" on Australian television. Original footage of Gyngell's opening address is not believed to exist, with the oft-screened "opening" footage being re-created in 1959 for archival purposes. Other early programming included the 1958 variety music program ''[[Bandstand (Australia)|Bandstand]]'' which was launched by [[Brian Henderson (television presenter)|Brian Henderson]]. It lasted for 14 years on the station and launched the careers of many Australian performers.

In 1957, the station formed an affiliation with [[Melbourne]] station [[HSV-7]], allowing them to share programming. In 1963, station affiliations changed; TCN-9 formed part of the [[National Television Network]] with [[GTV-9]] in Melbourne, [[QTQ-9]] in [[Brisbane]] and [[NWS-9]] in [[Adelaide]]. These stations formed the basis of what is now the [[Nine Network]], although only the Sydney and Melbourne stations were owned by the Packer-controlled company [[Nine Network|Nine Network Limited]].

On Sir Frank Packer's death in 1974 ownership of Nine Network passed to his younger son [[Kerry Packer]]. Kerry's older brother [[Clyde Packer]] had been groomed to take over from their father but after a bitter split with his father ca. 1970 he relinquished his role in the company and subsequently moved to the USA.
In January 1987, Kerry Packer sold the Sydney and Melbourne stations to [[Alan Bond (businessman)|Alan Bond]]'s Bond Media for $1.055 billion, including $200 million in shares of Bond Media. Bond already owned the [[Perth]] and [[Brisbane]] Nine affiliate stations (among others). In 1990, Bond Media's inability to pay out preference shares to Packer forced Nine into receivership. In July 1990, Packer bought back the expanded Nine network (Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane) for only $200 million, one-fifth of what he sold it for. Perth was not included due to Bond selling it to Sunraysia Television before Packer buying back the company.

In 1994, Packer's print operations (owned by [[Australian Consolidated Press]]) and the Nine Network were merged into one new company, [[Publishing and Broadcasting Limited]] (PBL). On 1 October 1997, TCN-9 performed the first on-air trial of [[digital television|digital broadcasting]] in the southern hemisphere.

TCN commenced digital television transmission in January 2001, broadcasting on VHF Channel 8 while maintaining analogue transmission on VHF Channel 9.
The analogue signal for TCN was shut off at 9.00am [[AEDST]], Tuesday, 3 December 2013.

==News==
{{further|Nine News Sydney|Nine News}}
''Nine News Sydney'' is TCN's flagship nightly news bulletin presented by [[Peter Overton]] on Sunday to Thursday nights and [[Georgie Gardner]] on Friday & Saturday nights. Sports news is presented by [[Cameron Williams]] on Sunday to Thursday nights and [[Erin Molan]] on Friday and Saturday nights. [[Amber Sherlock]] presents the weather on Sunday to Thursday nights and Belinda Russell on Friday and Saturday nights. [[Deborah Knight]] and [[Ben Fordham]] are regular fill-in presenters.

[[Brian Henderson (television presenter)|Brian Henderson]] was Nine's Sydney news presenter for a record 45 years - including 38 years presenting on weeknights. Retiring in November 2002, Henderson was succeeded as weeknight presenter by [[Jim Waley]], who was at the time host of the ''Sunday'' program and was one of Nine's most experienced presenters.

In January 2005, despite some considerable ratings success, Waley was replaced as weeknight presenter by [[Mark Ferguson (television presenter)|Mark Ferguson]], who was previously the weekend presenter. Ferguson's successor as weekend presenter [[Mike Munro]] resigned in 2008 and was replaced by [[Michael Usher]].

In 2009, following a continuing run of poor ratings, Ferguson was demoted to his former role as weekend news presenter, with [[Peter Overton]] taking over as news presenter on weeknights. Later in the year, Ferguson was removed from the presenting duties on the Sydney bulletins after announcing his decision to move to the [[Seven Network]], but he didn't move to Seven until he trialled the hosting duties on ''Nine's Afternoon News'' only appearing on-air up until his departure on September 25, 2009.

[[Georgie Gardner]] was appointed as Friday & Saturday night presenter with [[Peter Overton]] now also presenting the Sunday night bulletin.

In 2011, ''[[Nine News|Nine News Sydney]]'' officially overtook ''[[Seven News|Seven News Sydney]]'' in the ratings for the first time in seven years, winning 26 weeks to Seven's 14 weeks.<ref>[http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2011/10/22/nine-news-sydney-takes-ratings-crown-from-seven/ Nine News Sydney takes ratings crown from Seven], Media Spy, 22 October 2011</ref>
