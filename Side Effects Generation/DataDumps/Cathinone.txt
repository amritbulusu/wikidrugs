'''Cathinone''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|θ|ᵻ|n|oʊ|n}} (also known as '''benzoylethanamine''', or '''β-keto-amphetamine''') is a [[monoamine]] [[alkaloid]] found in the [[shrub]] ''[[Catha edulis]]'' ([[khat]]) and is chemically similar to [[ephedrine]], [[cathine]], [[methcathinone]] and other [[amphetamines]].   It is probably the main contributor to the [[stimulant]] effect of ''Catha edulis''. Cathinone differs from many other amphetamines in that it has a [[ketone]] [[functional group]]. Other phenethylamines that share this structure include the stimulants [[methcathinone]], [[MDPV]], [[mephedrone]] and the [[antidepressant]] [[bupropion]] among others.

==History==

===Discovery=== 
[[Khat]] has been cultivated in the Horn of Africa and Arabian Peninsula region of the world for thousands of years. It is most commonly chewed for the [[euphoria|euphoric]] effect it produces. The active ingredient was first proposed in 1930, when [[cathine]] was identified as a predominant alkaloid in the plant.<ref name="Patel">{{cite journal|last1=Patel|first1=N.B.|title=Mechanism of Action of Cathinone: The Active Ingredient of Khat (Catha Edulis)|journal=East African Medical Journal|date=2009|volume=77|issue=6|pages=329–32|pmid=12858935|doi=10.4314/eamj.v77i6.46651}}</ref> Cathine was thought to be the main active ingredient in khat until the 1960s, when it was found that the amount of cathine in the khat leaves is insufficient to produce the effects observed. In 1975, the United Nations Narcotic Laboratory analyzed khat leaves from [[Yemen]], [[Kenya]] and [[Madagascar]] and found the presence of a different alkaloid, cathinone.<ref name="Patel"/> Cathinone is a similar molecule to cathine, but is much more abundant in younger plants.  This finding caused scientists to speculate about whether cathinone was the true active ingredient in khat.<ref name="Patel"/>  
  
A study was conducted in 1994 to test the effects of cathinone. Six volunteers who had never chewed khat were given an active khat sample and a cathinone-free [[placebo]] sample.<ref name="Wilder">{{cite journal|last1=Wilder|first1=Peter|last2=Mathys|first2=Karoline|last3=Brenneisen|first3=Rudolf|last4=Kalix|first4=Peter|last5=Fisch|first5=Hans-Ulrich|title=Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics of Khat: A Controlled Study|journal=Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics|date=May 1994|volume=55|issue=5|pages=556–62|pmid=7910126}}</ref> The researchers analyzed the participants’ moods, activity levels and blood pressure before and after consuming the khat or placebo. This analysis showed that cathinone produced amphetamine-like symptoms, leading the researchers to confirm that cathinone, not cathine, is the active ingredient in khat leaves.<ref name="Wilder"/>

===Cultural significance===
Over 20 million people in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and [[East Africa]] chew khat leaves daily.  It is an important piece of the culture and economy in this region, especially in [[Ethiopia]], where khat is said to have originated, Kenya, [[Djibouti]], and Yemen.  Men usually chew it during parties or other social gatherings while smoking cigarettes and drinking tea.  Farmers and other workers also use khat in the afternoon to reduce fatigue and hunger as the day goes on.  It functions like the [[caffeine]] in a strong cup of coffee as an anti-fatigue drug.  Students and drivers have been known to use it to stay alert for longer periods of time.<ref name="Kirby">{{cite web|last1=Kirby|first1=Alex|title=Yemen's khat habit soaks up water|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6530453.stm|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref> 
[[File:Qat man.jpg|thumb|left|Man chewing khat]]
In order to produce its desired effects, khat leaves should be chewed fresh.  The fresh leaves have a higher concentration of cathinone.  Waiting too long after cultivation to chew the leaf will allow the cathinone to break down into its less potent form, cathine.  Because of the need for quick chewing, it is a habit that has historically been prevalent only where the plant grows.  However, in the recent years with improvements in road and air transport, khat chewing has spread to all corners of the world.

The cultivation of khat in Yemen is a highly profitable industry for farmers.  Khat plants will grow differently depending on the climate they are grown in and each one will produce different amounts of cathinone.<ref name="Al-Motarreb">{{cite journal|last1=Al-Motarreb|first1=Ahmed|last2=Baker|first2=Kathryn|last3=Broadley|first3=Kenneth J.|title=Khat: Pharmacological and Medical Aspects and Its Social Use in Yemen|journal=Phytotherapy Research|date=2002|volume=16|issue=2|pages=403–13|doi=10.1002/ptr.1106|pmid=12203257}}</ref>  It generally doesn’t grow as well in coastal, hot climates.  In Yemen, the khat plant is named after the region in which it is grown.  The Nehmi khat plant has the highest known concentration of cathinone, 342.5&nbsp;mg/100g.<ref name="Al-Motarreb"/>

===Legality===
Internationally, cathinone is a [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Schedules of Controlled Substances|Schedule I]] drug under the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]].<ref name="urlwww.incb.org">{{cite web | url = http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/green.pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120831222336/http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/green.pdf | archivedate = 2012-08-31 | title = List of psychotropic substances under international control | format = PDF | work = International Narcotics Control Board | publisher = United Nations | year = 2003 }}</ref> Circa 1993, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] added cathinone to the [[Controlled Substances Act]]'s Schedule I.

The sale of khat is legal in some jurisdictions, but illegal in others (see [[Khat#Regulation|Khat (Regulation)]]). [[Substituted cathinone]]s were also often used as the key ingredient of recreational drug mixes commonly known as "[[Bath salts (drug)|bath salts]]" in the United States.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/science/july-dec12/bathsalts_09-20.html |title=Synthetic Street Drug Camouflaged as Bath Salts Has Dangerous, Bizarre Effects | publisher=PBS NewsHour | date=20 September 2012 | accessdate= 7 December 2013}}</ref><ref>The Guardian: [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/04/Israel Drugs and dance as Israelis blot out intifada | World news | The Guardian], accessdate: 4/19/2015</ref><ref>National | Globalnews.ca: [http://globalnews.ca/news/1942263/what-you-need-to-know-about-flakka-the-latest-drug-causing-erratic-behaviour/ What you need to know about flakka, the latest drug causing erratic behaviour - National | Globalnews.ca], accessdate: 4/19/2015</ref>

==Biological effects==

===Mechanism of action===
Cathinone has been found to stimulate the release of [[dopamine]] and inhibit the reuptake of [[epinephrine]], [[norepinephrine]] and [[serotonin]] in the [[central nervous system]] (CNS). These [[neurotransmitters]] are all considered [[monoamine]]s and share the general structure of an [[aromatic ring]] and an [[amine]] group attached by a two-carbon separator.<ref name="Al-Motarreb"/> Because cathinone is a [[hydrophobic]] molecule, it can easily cross cell membranes and other barriers, including the [[blood-brain barrier]].<ref name="Hugins"/> This property allows it to interact with the monoamine transporters in the [[synaptic cleft]] between [[neurons]]. Cathinone induces the release of [[dopamine]] from brain striatal preparations that are prelabelled either with dopamine or its precursors.<ref name="pmid6791236">{{cite journal | author = Kalix P | title = Cathinone, an alkaloid from khat leaves with an amphetamine-like releasing effect | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 74 | issue = 3 | pages = 269–70 | year = 1981 | pmid = 6791236 | doi = 10.1007/BF00427108 }}</ref>

The metabolites of cathinone, cathine and norephedrine also possess CNS stimulation, but create much weaker effects.<ref name="drugbank">{{cite web|title=Cathinone|url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01560|website=Drug Bank|publisher=Drug Bank|accessdate=10 March 2015}}</ref> The effects of cathinone on the body can be countered by a preceding administration of a dopamine-receptor [[antagonist]].<ref name="drugbank"/> The antagonist will keep the neuron at its resting state, so the cathinone cannot cause extraneous release of dopamine or other neurotransmitters.

Cathinone can also affect the [[peripheral nervous system]] (PNS) by blocking [[adrenergic receptor]]s and inhibiting [[smooth muscle]] contraction.<ref name="Hugins">{{cite web|last1=Hugins|first1=Kevin B.|title=Cathinone: History, Synthesis, and Human Applications|url=http://www.slideshare.net/KevinHugins/cathinone-history-synthesis-and-human-applications|website=slideshare|accessdate=8 March 2015}}</ref> It can also induce dry mouth, blurred vision and increased blood pressure and heart rate.<ref name="Al-Motarreb"/>

===Pharmacology===
Khat leaves are removed from the plant stalk and are kept in a ball in the cheek and chewed. Chewing releases juices from the leaves, which include the alkaloid cathinone. The absorption of cathinone has two phases: one in the [[buccal mucosa]] and one in the [[stomach]] and [[small intestine]].<ref name="Wilder"/> The stomach and small intestine are very important in the absorption of ingested alkaloids.<ref name="Wilder"/> At approximately 2.3 hours after chewing khat leaves, the maximum concentration of cathinone in blood plasma is reached. The mean residence time is 5.2 ± 3.4 hours.<ref name="Wilder"/> The elimination half-life of cathinone is 1.5 ± 0.8 hours.<ref name="Wilder"/> A two-compartment model for absorption and elimination best describes this data. However, at most, only 7% of the ingested cathinone is recovered in the urine.<ref name="Wilder"/> This indicates that the cathinone is being broken down in the body. Cathinone has been shown to selectively metabolize into R,S-(-)-norephedrine and cathine. The reduction of the [[ketone]] group in cathinone will produce cathine. This reduction is catalyzed by enzymes in the liver. The spontaneous breakdown of cathinone is the reason it must be chewed fresh after cultivation.<ref name="Wilder"/>

===Effects on health===
The first documentation of the khat plant being used in medicine was in a book published by an Arabian physician in the 10th century.<ref name="Al-Motarreb"/> It was used as an [[antidepressant]] because it led to feelings of happiness and excitement. Chronic khat chewing can also create drug dependence, as shown by animal studies.<ref name="Al-Motarreb"/> In such studies, monkeys were trained to push a lever to receive the drug reward. As the monkeys' dependence increased, they pressed the lever at an increasing frequency.<ref name="Al-Motarreb"/>

Khat chewing and the effects of cathinone on the body differ from person to person, but there's a general pattern of behavior that emerges after ingesting fresh cathinone:<ref name="Al-Motarreb"/>
# Feelings of euphoria that last for one to two hours
# Discussion of serious issues and increased [[irritability]]
# The chewer’s imagination is very active
# Depressive stage
# Irritability, [[anorexia]] and [[insomnia]]

There are other effects not related to the CNS. The chewer can develop [[constipation]] and [[heartburn]] after a khat session. Long-term effects of cathinone can include [[gum disease]] or [[oral cancer]], [[cardiovascular disease]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].<ref name="Al-Motarreb"/> The [[withdrawal symptoms]] of cathinone include, [[hot flashes]], [[lethargy]] and a great urge to use the drug for at least the first two days.<ref name="Al-Motarreb"/>

==Chemistry==

===Biosynthesis===
The synthesis of cathinone in khat begins with L-phenylalanine and the first step is carried out by L-phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), which cleaves off an ammonia group and creates a carbon-carbon double bond, forming [[cinnamic acid]].<ref name="Hagel"/>  After this, the molecule can either go through a beta-oxidative pathway or a non-beta-oxidative pathway.  The beta-oxidative pathway produces [[benzoyl-CoA]] while the non-beta-oxidative pathway produces [[benzoic acid]].<ref name="Hagel"/>  Both of these molecules can be converted to 1-phenylpropane-1,2-dione by a [[condensation reaction]] catalyzed by a ThDP-dependent enzyme (Thiamine diphosphate-dependent enzyme) with [[pyruvate]] and producing CO2.<ref name="Hagel"/>  1-phenylpropane-1,2-dione goes though a transaminase reaction to replace a ketone with an ammonia group to form (S)-cathinone.  (S)-Cathinone can then undergo a reduction reaction to produce the less potent but structurally similar cathine or norephedrine, which are also found in the plant.<ref name="Hagel">{{cite journal|last1=Hagel|first1=Jillian M.|last2=Krizevski|first2=Raz|last3=Kilpatrick|first3=Korey|last4=Sitrit|first4=Yaron|last5=Marsolais|first5=Frédéric|last6=Lewinsohn|first6=Efraim|last7=Facchini|first7=Peter J.|title=Expressed Sequence Tag Analysis of Khat (Catha Edulis) Provides a Putative Molecular Biochemical Basis for the Biosynthesis of Phenylpropylamino Alkaloids|journal=Genetics and Molecular Biology|date=October 2011|volume=34|issue=4|pages=640–646|doi=10.1590/S1415-47572011000400017|pmid=22215969|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Expressed+Sequence+Tag+Analysis+of+Khat+(Catha+Edulis)+Provides+a+Putative+Molecular+Biochemical+Basis+for+the+Biosynthesis+of+Phenylpropylamino+Alkaloids|accessdate=8 March 2015|pmc=3229120}}</ref>

[[File:Non-Beta Oxidative Biosynthesis of Cathinone.png|thumb|center|Mechanism of the Non-Beta Oxidation pathway for the biosynthesis of S-Cathinone in the Khat plant]]

Aside from the beta- and non-beta-oxidative pathways, the biosynthesis of cathinone can proceed through a CoA-dependent pathway.  The CoA-dependent pathway is actually a mix between the two main pathways as it starts like the beta-oxidative pathway and then when it loses CoA, it finishes the synthesis in the non-beta-oxidative pathway.  In this pathway, the trans-cinnamic acid produced from L-phenylalanine is ligated to a [[Coenzyme A]] (CoA), just like the beginning of the beta-oxidative pathway.<ref name="Hagel"/> It then undergoes [[hydration reaction|hydration]] at the double bond.  This product then loses the CoA to produce [[benzaldehyde]], an intermediate of the non-beta-oxidative pathway.  Benzaldehyde is converted into benzoic acid and proceeds through the rest of the synthesis.<ref name="Hagel"/>

===Synthetic production===
Cathinone can be synthetically produced from propiophenone through a [[Friedel-Crafts]] Acylation of propionic acid and benzene.<ref name="Hugins"/>  The resulting [[propiophenone]] can be brominated, and the bromine can be substituted with ammonia to produce a racemic mixture of cathinone. A different synthetic strategy must be employed to produce enantiomerically pure (S)-cathinone.  This synthetic route starts out with the N-acetylation of the [[optically active]] [[amino acid]], S-alanine.<ref name="Hugins"/>  Then, [[phosphorus pentachloride]] (PCl<sub>5</sub>) is used to chlorinate the [[carboxylic acid]] forming an acyl chloride. At the same time, a Friedel-Crafts acylation is preformed on benzene with aluminum chloride catalyst.  Finally, the [[acetyl]] protecting group is removed by heating with hydrochloric acid to form enantiomerically pure S-(-)-cathinone.<ref name="Hugins"/>

===Structure===
Cathinone can be extracted from ''[[Catha edulis]]'', or synthesized from ''α''-bromopropiophenone (which is easily made from [[propiophenone]]). Because cathinone is both a [[primary amine]] and a [[ketone]], it is very likely to [[dimer (chemistry)|dimerize]], especially as a free base isolated from plant matter.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shulgin|first=Alexander|title=4-Hydroxy-5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine, Psilocybe mushrooms, Psilocin|url=http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/shulgin/blg/2005/12/4-hydroxy-5-methoxy-nn_07.html|date=7 December 2005|work=Ask Dr. Shulgin Online|accessdate=10 September 2013}}</ref>

The structure of cathinone is very similar to that of other molecules.  By reducing the ketone, it becomes cathine if it retains its stereochemistry, or norephedrine if its stereochemistry is inverted.  Cathine is a less potent version of cathinone and cathinone's spontaneous reduction is the reason that older khat plants are not as stimulating and younger ones.  Cathinone and amphetamine are closely related in that amphetamine is only lacking the ketone C=O group.<ref name="Synthetic Cathinone">{{cite web|title=Synthetic cathinones drug profile|url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/drug-profiles/synthetic-cathinones|website=European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction|publisher=EMCDDA|accessdate=8 March 2015}}</ref>  Cathinone is structurally related to [[methcathinone]], in much the same way as [[amphetamine]] is related to [[methamphetamine]]. Cathinone differs from amphetamine by possessing a [[ketone]] [[oxygen]] atom (C=O) on the ''β'' (beta) position of the side chain.  The corresponding alcohol,  [[cathine]], is a less powerful stimulant. The biophysiological conversion from cathinone to cathine is to blame for the depotentiation of [[khat]] leaves over time. Fresh leaves have a greater ratio of cathinone to cathine than dried ones, therefore having more psychoactive effects.

[[File:Bupropion.png|thumb|left|Bupropion: a cathinone derivative]] 
There are many cathinone derivatives that include the addition of an R group to the amino end of the molecule.  Some of these derivatives have medical uses as well.  [[Bupropion]] is one of the most commonly prescribed antidepressants and its structure is Cathinone with a tertiary butyl group attached to the nitrogen and chlorine attached to the benzene ring [[meta- (chemistry)]] to the main carbon chain.<ref name="Synthetic Cathinone"/>

Other cathinone derivatives are strong psychoactive drugs.  One such drug is [[methylone]], a drug structurally similar to [[MDMA]].
