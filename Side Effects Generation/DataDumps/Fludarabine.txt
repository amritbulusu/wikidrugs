<!-- History and culture -->
Fludarabine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1991.<ref name=AHFS2016/> It is on the [[World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines]], the most effective and safe medicines needed in a [[health system]].<ref name=WHO19th>{{cite web|title=WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (19th List)|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/EML_2015_FINAL_amended_NOV2015.pdf?ua=1|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=8 December 2016|date=April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213052708/http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/EML_2015_FINAL_amended_NOV2015.pdf?ua=1|archivedate=13 December 2016|df=}}</ref> The wholesale cost in the [[developing world]] is about 54.00 USD per 50&nbsp;mg vial.<ref name=ERC2014>{{cite web|title=Fludarabine Phosphate|url=http://erc.msh.org/dmpguide/resultsdetail.cfm?language=english&code=FLUD50I&s_year=2014&year=2014&str=50%20mg&desc=Fludarabine%20Phosphate&pack=new&frm=VIAL&rte=INJ&class_code2=08%2E2%2E&supplement=&class_name=%2808%2E2%2E%29Cytotoxic%20and%20adjuvant%20medicines%3Cbr%3E|website=International Drug Price Indicator Guide|accessdate=8 December 2016}}</ref> In the United Kingdom it costs about 155.00 pounds per 50&nbsp;mg vial.<ref name=BNF69>{{cite book|title=British national formulary : BNF 69|date=2015|publisher=British Medical Association|isbn=9780857111562|page=590|edition=69}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
Fludarabine is highly effective in the treatment of [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]], producing higher response rates than [[alkylating antineoplastic agent|alkylating agent]]s such as [[chlorambucil]] alone.<ref name=Rai>{{cite journal | author = Rai KR ''et al.'' | year = 2000 | title = Fludarabine compared with chlorambucil as primary therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia | url = | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 343 | issue = | pages = 1750–7 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200012143432402 | pmid = 11114313 }}</ref>
Fludarabine is used in various combinations with [[cyclophosphamide]], [[mitoxantrone]], [[dexamethasone]] and [[rituximab]] in the treatment of [[Indolent condition|indolent]] [[lymphoma|non-Hodgkins lymphomas]].  As part of the ''FLAG'' regimen, fludarabine is used together with [[cytarabine]] and [[granulocyte colony-stimulating factor]] in the treatment of [[acute myeloid leukaemia]].  Because of its immunosuppressive effects, fludarabine is also used in some conditioning regimens prior to [[bone marrow transplant|allogeneic stem cell transplant]].

==Side effects==
Fludarabine is associated with profound [[lymphopenia]], and as a consequence, increases the risk of [[opportunistic infection]]s significantly. Patients who have been treated with fludarabine will usually be asked to take [[co-trimoxazole]] or to use monthly nebulised [[pentamidine]] to prevent [[Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia|''Pneumocystis jiroveci'' pneumonia]].  The profound lymphopenia caused by fludarabine renders patients susceptible to [[transfusion-associated graft versus host disease]], an oftentimes fatal complication of [[blood transfusion]].  For this reason, all patients who have ever received fludarabine should only be given [[irradiation|irradiated]] blood components.

Fludarabine causes anemia, thrombocytopenia and [[neutropenia]], requiring regular blood count monitoring.  Some patients require blood and [[platelet]] transfusion, or [[granulocyte colony-stimulating factor|G-CSF]] injections to boost [[neutrophil]] counts.

Fludarabine is associated with the development of severe [[autoimmune hemolytic anemia]] in a proportion of patients.<ref name=Gonzalez>{{cite journal | pmid = 9698219 | volume=40 | title=Severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia in eight patients treated with fludarabine | date=June 1998 | author=Gonzalez H, Leblond V, Azar N, ''et al.'' | journal=Hematol Cell Ther | pages=113–8}}</ref>

Difficulties are often encountered when harvesting peripheral blood stem cells from patients previously treated with fludarabine.<ref name=Tournilhac>{{cite journal | author = Tournilhac O ''et al.'' | year = 2004 | title = Impact of frontline fludarabine and cyclophosphamide combined treatment on peripheral blood stem cell mobilization in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia | url = | journal = Blood | volume = 103 | issue = | pages = 363–5 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2003-05-1449 | pmid = 12969985 }}</ref>

==Pharmacology==
Fludarabine is a [[purine analog]], and can be given both orally and intravenously.  Fludarabine inhibits [[DNA synthesis]] by interfering with [[ribonucleotide reductase]] and [[DNA polymerase]].  It is active against both dividing and resting cells. Being phosphorylated, fludarabine is ionized at physiologic pH and is effectually trapped in blood. This provides some level of specificity for blood cells, both cancerous and healthy.

==History==
Fludarabine was produced by John Montgomery and Kathleen Hewson of the [[Southern Research Institute]] in 1968.<ref name="Sneader">{{cite book| author = Sneader, Walter| title = Drug discovery: a history| publisher = Wiley| location = New York| year = 2005| pages = 258| isbn = 0-471-89979-8| oclc = }}</ref>

==Names==
It is generally used as its phosphate salt known as fludarabine phosphate.
