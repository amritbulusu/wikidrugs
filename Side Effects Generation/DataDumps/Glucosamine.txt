'''Glucosamine''' (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>13</sub>NO<sub>5</sub>) is an [[amino sugar]] and a prominent precursor in the [[biochemical]] synthesis of [[glycosylation|glycosylated]] proteins and lipids. Glucosamine is part of the structure of the [[polysaccharide]]s [[chitosan]] and [[chitin]], which compose the exoskeletons of [[crustacean]]s and other [[arthropod]]s, as well as the cell walls of [[fungi]] and many higher organisms. Glucosamine is one of the most abundant [[monosaccharide]]s.<ref name="carb"/> It is produced commercially by the [[hydrolysis]] of crustacean [[exoskeleton]]s or, less commonly, by fermentation of a grain such as corn or wheat.

Evidence for the effectiveness of glucosamine supplements is mixed. In the United States, it is one of the most common non-vitamin, non-mineral, [[dietary supplement]]s used by adults.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nccam.nih.gov/news/2008/nhsr12.pdf|title=Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use Among Adults and Children: United States, 2007|date=December 10, 2008|publisher=National Center for Health Statistics|accessdate=2009-08-16}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
Oral glucosamine is a [[dietary supplement]] and is not a [[pharmaceutical drug]].  It is illegal in the US to market any dietary supplement as a treatment for any disease or condition.<ref>Staff, FDA Last Updated April 11, 2013 [http://www.fda.gov/Food/DietarySupplements/QADietarySupplements/default.htm Q&A on Dietary Supplements]</ref>  Glucosamine is marketed to support the structure and function of joints, and the marketing is targeted to people suffering from [[osteoarthritis]]. Commonly sold forms of glucosamine are glucosamine sulfate, glucosamine hydrochloride, and [[N-Acetylglucosamine|''N''-acetylglucosamine]]. Of the three commonly available forms of glucosamine, only glucosamine sulfate is given a "likely effective" rating for treating osteoarthritis.<ref name="mlp">{{cite web|title=Glucosamine sulfate|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/807.html|publisher=MedlinePlus, US National Library of Medicine|date=22 April 2016}}</ref> Glucosamine is often sold in combination with other supplements such as [[chondroitin sulfate]] and [[methylsulfonylmethane]].

Glucosamine, along with commonly used [[chondroitin]], is not routinely prescribed to treat people who have symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee, as there is insufficient evidence that this treatment is helpful.<ref name="AAOSfive">{{Citation |author1 = American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons |author1-link = American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons |date = February 2013 |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons |work = [[Choosing Wisely]]: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-academy-of-orthopaedic-surgeons/ |accessdate = 19 May 2013}}</ref>

As is common with heavily promoted dietary supplements, the claimed benefits of glucosamine are based principally on clinical and laboratory studies. Clinical studies are divided, with some reporting relief from arthritic pain and stiffness, while higher quality studies report no benefit above placebo.<ref name="towheed">{{cite journal|pmid=15846645|year=2005|author1=Towheed|first1=T.

{{main|Clinical trials on glucosamine and chondroitin}}

Since glucosamine is a precursor for [[glycosaminoglycan]]s, and glycosaminoglycans are a major component of [[cartilage]], research has focused on the potential for supplemental glucosamine to beneficially influence cartilage structure and alleviate [[arthritis]].

In the second study, oral glucosamine sulfate capsules (1500&nbsp;mg) were given daily for two weeks to 12 people with [[osteoarthritis]]. Glucosamine concentrations in plasma and [[synovial fluid]] increased significantly from baseline levels and the levels in the two fluids were highly correlated. The authors interpreted that these levels could be biologically advantageous to [[articular cartilage]], but the levels are still 10 - 100 fold lower than required to positively affect the [[cartilage]] ([[chondrocytes]]) to build new tissue.<ref>{{Cite journal

A number of studies have measured the bioavailability of glucosamine after oral administration to horses. When given as a single oral dose (nine grams) with or without [[chondroitin sulfate]] (three grams) to ten horses, glucosamine (hydrochloride) was detected in the blood with a maximum level of 10.6 (+/- 6.9) micrograms per millilitre at two hours after dosing.<ref>{{Cite journal

The authors calculated that these glucosamine synovial fluid levels achieved by the oral route were 500 fold lower than that required to have a positive effect on the metabolism of [[cartilage]] cells. A follow up study by the same research group compared glucosamine sulfate with glucosamine hydrochloride at the same dose (20&nbsp;mg/kg) in eight horses and found a higher fluid concentration with the sulfate preparation (158&nbsp;ng/mL compared to 89&nbsp;ng/mL one hour post oral dose).<ref>{{Cite journal
