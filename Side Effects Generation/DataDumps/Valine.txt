'''Valine''' (abbreviated as '''Val''' or '''V''') is an α-[[amino acid]] that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-[[amino group]] (which is in the protonated −NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> form under biological conditions), an α-[[Carboxylic acid|carboxylic acid group]] (which is in the deprotonated −COO<sup>−</sup> form under biological conditions), and a side chain [[Isopropyl|isopropyl group]], making it a [[Chemical polarity|non-polar]] [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] amino acid. It is [[Essential amino acid|essential]] in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it: it must be obtained from the diet. Human dietary sources are foods that contain protein, such as meats, dairy products, soy products, beans and legumes. In the [[genetic code]] it is encoded by all [[codons]] starting with GU, namely GUU, GUC, GUA, and GUG.

Like [[leucine]] and [[isoleucine]], valine is a [[Branched-chain amino acid|branched-chain]] amino acid. In [[sickle-cell disease]], a single [[glutamic acid]] in β-globin is replaced with valine. Because valine is [[Hydrophobic effect|hydrophobic]], whereas glutamic acid is hydrophilic, this change makes the hemoglobin prone to abnormal aggregation.

==History and etymology==
Valine was first isolated from [[casein]] in 1901 by [[Hermann Emil Fischer]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/622178/valine |title=valine |work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |accessdate=2015-12-06}}</ref> The name valine comes from [[valeric acid]], which in turn is named after the plant [[Valerian (herb)|valerian]] due to the presence of the acid in the roots of the plant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/valine |title=valine |work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |accessdate=2015-12-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/valeric+acid |title=valeric acid |work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |accessdate=2015-12-06}}</ref>

==Nomenclature==
According to [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry|IUPAC]], carbon atoms forming valine are numbered sequentially starting from 1 denoting the [[Carboxylic acid|carboxyl]] carbon, whereas 4 and 4' denote the two terminal [[Methyl group|methyl]] carbons.<ref>{{cite book

==Metabolism==
===Source and biosynthesis===
Valine, like other branched-chain amino acids, is synthesized by plants, but not by animals.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=shDYCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA159|title=Nitrogen metabolism in rice|last=Basuchaudhuri|first=Pranab|publisher=CRC Press|year=2016|isbn=9781498746687|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=159|oclc=945482059}}</ref> It is therefore an [[essential amino acid]] in animals, and needs to be present in the diet. Adult humans require about 4 mg/kg body weight daily.<ref name="DRItext">{{cite book | last1 = [[Institute of Medicine]] | title = Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrates, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids | chapter = Protein and Amino Acids | publisher = The National Academies Press | year = 2002 | location = Washington, DC | pages = 589–768 | url = https://www.nap.edu/read/10490/chapter/12}}</ref> It is synthesized in plants and bacteria via several steps starting from  [[pyruvic acid]]. The initial part of the pathway also leads to [[leucine]]. The intermediate [[alpha-Ketoisovaleric acid|α-ketoisovalerate]] undergoes [[reductive amination]] with [[glutamate]].  Enzymes involved in this biosynthesis include:<ref>{{Lehninger3rd}}.</ref>
# [[Acetolactate synthase]] (also known as acetohydroxy acid synthase)
# [[Ketol-acid reductoisomerase|Acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase]]
# [[Dihydroxyacid dehydratase]]
# [[Valine aminotransferase]]

=== Degradation ===
Like other branched-chain amino acids, the catabolism of valine starts with the removal of the amino group by [[transamination]], giving [[Alpha-Ketoisovaleric acid|alpha-ketoisovalerate]], an alpha-[[keto acid]], which is converted to [[isobutyryl-CoA]] through [[oxidative decarboxylation]] by the [[Branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex|branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=|title=Biochemistry|last=Mathews|first=Christopher K.,|date=2000|publisher=Benjamin Cummings|others=Van Holde, K. E., Ahern, Kevin G.|year=|isbn=0805330666|edition=3rd ed|location=San Francisco, Calif.|pages=776|oclc=42290721}}</ref> This is further oxidised and rearranged to [[succinyl-CoA]], which can enter the [[citric acid cycle]].

==Synthesis==
[[Racemic]] valine can be synthesized by bromination of [[3-Methylbutanoic acid|isovaleric acid]] followed by amination of the α-bromo derivative<ref>{{OrgSynth | last = Marvel | first = C.

=== Hematopoietic stem cells ===
Dietary valine is essential for [[hematopoietic stem cell]] (HSC) self-renewal, as demonstrated by experiments in mice.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Taya|first=Yuki|last2=Ota|first2=Yasunori|last3=Wilkinson|first3=Adam C.|last4=Kanazawa|first4=Ayano|last5=Watarai|first5=Hiroshi|last6=Kasai|first6=Masataka|last7=Nakauchi|first7=Hiromitsu|last8=Yamazaki|first8=Satoshi|date=2016-12-02|title=Depleting dietary valine permits nonmyeloablative mouse hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|journal=Science|volume=354|issue=6316|pages=1152–1155|doi=10.1126/science.aag3145}}</ref> Dietary valine restriction selectively depletes long-term repopulating HSC in mouse bone marrow. Successful stem cell transplantation was achieved in mice without irradiation after 3 weeks on a valine restricted diet. Long term survival of the transplanted mice was achieved when valine was returned to the diet gradually over a 2 week period to avoid [[refeeding syndrome]].
