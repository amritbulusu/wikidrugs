[[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]], the British Association for Psychopharmacology, and the World Federation of Societies for Biological Psychiatry suggest that there is little difference in effectiveness between antipsychotics in prevention of relapse, and recommend that the specific choice of antipsychotic be chosen based on persons preference and side effect profile.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/CG178 |title=Psychosis and schizophrenia in adults: treatment and management &#124; Guidance and guidelines &#124; NICE |publisher = National Institute for Health and Care Excellence }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Barnes TR | title = Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology | journal = J.

In a 2013 comparison of 15 antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia, olanzapine was ranked third. It was 5% more effective than [[risperidone]] (4th), 24-27% more effective than [[haloperidol]], [[quetiapine]], and [[aripiprazole]], and 33% less effective than [[clozapine]] (1st).<ref name=Leucht2013/> A 2013 review of first episode schizophrenia concluded that olanzapine is superior to [[haloperidol]] in providing a lower discontinuation rate, and in short-term symptom reduction, response rate, negative symptoms, depression, cognitive function, discontinuation due to poor efficacy, and long-term relapse, but not in positive symptoms or on the Clinical Global Impressions score. In contrast, pooled second generation antipsychotics showed superiority to first generation antipsychotics only against the discontinuation, negative symptoms (with a much larger effect seen among industry- compared to government-sponsored studies), and cognition scores.  Olanzapine caused less extrapyramidal side effects, less akathisia, but caused significantly more weight gain, serum cholesterol increase, and triglyceride increase than haloperidol.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang JP, Gallego JA, Robinson DG, Malhotra AK, Kane JM, Correll CU |title=Efficacy and safety of individual second-generation vs. first-generation antipsychotics in first-episode psychosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Int.

===Elderly===
Citing an increased risk of [[stroke]], in 2004 the [[Committee on the Safety of Medicines]] (CSM) in the UK issued a warning that olanzapine and [[risperidone]], both atypical antipsychotic medications, should not be given to elderly patients with [[dementia]]. In the U.S., olanzapine comes with a [[black box warning]] for increased risk of death in elderly patients. It is not approved for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis.<ref>{{cite web

==Adverse effects==
{{See also|List of adverse effects of olanzapine}}

The principal side effect of olanzapine is weight gain, which may be profound in some cases and/or associated with derangement in the blood lipid and blood sugar profiles (see section [[Olanzapine#Metabolic effects|metabolic effects]]). A recent meta-analysis of the efficacy and tolerance of 15 antipsychotic drugs (APDs) found that it had the highest propensity for causing weight gain out of the 15 APD compared with a SMD of 0.74<ref name=Leucht2013/> Extrapyramidal side effects, although potentially serious, are infrequent to rare from olanzapine<ref name="lexicomp">Lexi-Comp Inc. (2010) Lexi-Comp Drug Information Handbook 19th North American Ed. Hudson, OH: Lexi-Comp Inc. {{ISBN|978-1-59195-278-7}}.</ref> but may include tremors and muscle rigidity.

Several patient groups are at a heightened risk of side effects from olanzapine and antipsychotics in general. Olanzapine may produce non-trivial [[hyperglycemia|high blood sugar]] in people with [[diabetes mellitus]]. Likewise, the elderly are at a greater risk of falls and accidental injury. Young males appear to be at heightened risk of [[dystonia|dystonic]] reactions, although these are relatively rare with olanzapine. Most antipsychotics, including olanzapine, may disrupt the body's natural thermoregulatory systems, thus permitting excursions to dangerous levels when situations (exposure to heat, strenuous exercise) occur.<ref name = TGA>{{cite web|title=PRODUCT INFORMATION OLANZAPINE SANDOZ® 2.5mg/5mg/7.5mg/10mg/15mg/20mg FILM-COATED TABLETS |work=TGA eBusiness Services|publisher=Sandoz Pty Ltd|date=8 June 2012|accessdate=26 November 2013|url=https://www.ebs.tga.gov.au/ebs/picmi/picmirepository.nsf/pdf?OpenAgent&id=CP-2011-PI-02375-3|format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Stöllberger C. |author2=Lutz W. |author3=Finsterer J. | year = 2009 | title = Heat-related side-effects of neurological and non-neurological medication may increase heatwave fatalities | url = | journal = European Journal of Neurology | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 879–882 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-1331.2009.02581.x}}</ref><ref name = DM>{{cite web|title=OLANZAPINE (olanzapine) tablet OLANZAPINE (olanzapine) tablet, orally disintegrating [Prasco Laboratories]|work=DailyMed|publisher=Prasco Laboratories|date=September 2013|accessdate=26 November 2013|url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=4464f13c-b9b9-4464-a05e-5b2cdc091fb2}}</ref><ref name = EMC>{{cite web|title=Olanzapine 10 mg tablets - Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC)|work=electronic Medicines Compendium|publisher=Aurobindo Pharma - Milpharm Ltd.|date=17 May 2013|accessdate=26 November 2013|url=http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/27661/SPC/Olanzapine++10+mg+tablets/}}</ref><ref name = MSR>{{cite web|title=Zyprexa, Zyprexa Relprevv (olanzapine) dosing, indications, interactions, adverse effects, and more|accessdate=26 November 2013|work=Medscape Reference|publisher=WebMD|url=http://reference.medscape.com/drug/zyprexa-relprevv-olanzapine-342979#showall}}</ref>

===Paradoxical effects===
Olanzapine is used therapeutically to treat serious mental illness. Occasionally it can have the opposite effect and provoke serious [[paradoxical reaction]]s in a small subgroup of people, causing unusual changes in personality, thoughts or behavior; hallucinations and [[suicidal ideation|excessive thoughts about suicide]] have also been linked to olanzapine use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/mtm/olanzapine.html |title=Olanzapine |author=Cerner Multum Incorporated |authorlink=Cerner |date=27 September 2011 |publisher=Drugs.com }}</ref>

===Metabolic effects===
Direct glucuronidation and [[cytochrome P450]] mediated oxidation are the primary metabolic pathways for olanzapine. In vitro studies suggest that CYPs 1A2 and 2D6, and the flavin-containing monooxygenase system are involved in olanzapine oxidation. CYP2D6 mediated oxidation appears to be a minor metabolic pathway in vivo.
The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] requires all atypical antipsychotics to include a warning about the risk of developing [[hyperglycemia]] and [[diabetes]], both of which are factors in the [[metabolic syndrome]]. These effects may be related to the drugs' ability to induce weight gain, although there are some reports of metabolic changes in the absence of weight gain.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ramankutty G | title = Olanzapine-induced destabilization of diabetes in the absence of weight gain | journal = Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica | volume = 105 | issue = 3 | pages = 235–6; discussion 236–7 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11939979 | doi = 10.1034/j.1600-0447.2002.2c257a.x }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lambert MT, Copeland LA, Sampson N, Duffy SA | title = New-onset type-2 diabetes associated with atypical antipsychotic medications | journal = Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry | volume = 30 | issue = 5 | pages = 919–23 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16581171 | doi = 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.02.007 }}</ref>  Studies have indicated that olanzapine carries a greater risk of causing and exacerbating diabetes than another commonly prescribed atypical antipsychotic, Risperidone.

Olanzapine has a higher affinity for [[serotonin receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub> serotonin receptors]] than [[dopamine receptor|D<sub>2</sub> dopamine]] receptors, which is a common property of most atypical antipsychotics, aside from the benzamide antipsychotics such as [[amisulpride]] along with the non-benzamides [[aripiprazole]], [[brexpiprazole]], [[blonanserin]], [[cariprazine]], [[melperone]] and [[perospirone]].

The mode of action of olanzapine's antipsychotic activity is unknown. It may involve antagonism of [[dopamine]] and [[serotonin]] receptors. Antagonism of dopamine receptors is associated with [[extrapyramidal effects]] such as [[tardive dyskinesia]] (TD), and with therapeutic effects. Antagonism of [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptors]] is associated with [[anticholinergic]] side effects such as dry mouth and constipation, in addition it may suppress or reduce the emergence of [[extrapyramidal effects]] for the duration of treatment, however it offers no protection against the development of [[tardive dyskinesia]]. In common with other second generation (atypical) antipsychotics, olanzapine poses a relatively low risk of extrapyramidal side effects including TD, due to its high affinity for the D<sub>1</sub> receptor over the D<sub>2</sub> receptor.<ref name="foyes">Lemke TL, Williams DA (2009) Foye's Medicinal Chemistry, 6th edition.

Antagonizing H<sub>1</sub> histamine receptors causes sedation and may cause weight gain, although antagonistic actions at serotonin 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> and dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors have also been associated with weight gain and appetite stimulation.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081120102136/http://www.askdrjones.com/medication-best-meds/part-six-medication-and-weight-control/ "Medication and Weight Control"]</ref>

===Pharmacokinetics===

====Metabolism====
Olanzapine is metabolized by the [[cytochrome P450]] system; principally by isozyme 1A2 and to a lesser extent by 2D6. By these mechanisms more than 40% of the oral dose, on average, is removed by the [[First pass effect|hepatic first-pass effect]].<ref name="lexicomp"/> Drugs or agents that increase the activity of CYP1A2, notably tobacco smoke, may significantly increase hepatic first-pass clearance of Olanzapine; conversely, drugs which inhibit 1A2 activity (examples: [[Ciprofloxacin]], [[Fluvoxamine]]) may reduce Olanzapine clearance.<ref name = olanzapinepi />

===Controversy and litigation===
Eli Lilly has faced many lawsuits from people who claimed they developed diabetes or other diseases after taking Zyprexa, as well as by various governmental entities, insurance companies, and others.  Lilly produced a large number of documents as part of the [[Discovery (law)|discovery phase]] of this litigation, which started in 2004; the documents were ruled to be confidential by a judge and placed under [[Record sealing|seal]], and later themselves became the subject of litigation.<ref name=NYTrelease/>

In 2006, Lilly paid $700 million to settle around 8,000 of these lawsuits,<ref>{{cite news |last=Berenson|first=Alex|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/04/business/04drug.html |title=Mother Wonders if Psychosis Drug Helped Kill Son |work=The New York Times |date=January 4, 2007 |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}</ref>  and in early 2007,  Lilly settled around 18,000 suits for $500 million, which brought the total Lilly had paid to settle suits related to the drug to $1.2 billion.<ref name=NYT200101>{{cite news|last1=Berenson|first1=Alex|title=Lilly Settles With 18,000 Over Zyprexa|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/05/business/05drug.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=5 January 2007}}</ref><ref name=timeso/>

===Trade names===
Olanzapine is generic and is available under many trade names worldwide.<ref name=Drugnames>Drugs.com [http://www.drugs.com/international/olanzapine.html Drugs.com international listings for Olanzapine] Page accessed August 4, 2015</ref>

===Dosage forms===
Olanzapine is marketed in a number of countries, with tablets ranging from 2.5 to 20 milligrams. Zyprexa (and generic olanzapine) is available as an orally-disintegrating "wafer" which rapidly dissolves in saliva. It is also available in 10 milligram vials for intramuscular injection.<ref name = olanzapinepi />

==Research==
Olanzapine has been investigated for use as an [[antiemetic]], particularly for the control of [[chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting]] (CINV).  A 2007 study demonstrated its successful potential for this use, achieving a complete response in the acute prevention of nausea and vomiting in 100% of patients treated with moderately and highly-emetogenic [[chemotherapy]], when used in combination with [[palonosetron]] and [[dexamethasone]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Navari RM, Einhorn LH, Loehrer PJ, Passik SD, Vinson J, McClean J, Chowhan N, Hanna NH, Johnson CS | title = A phase II trial of olanzapine, dexamethasone, and palonosetron for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting: A Hoosier oncology group study | journal = Supportive Care in Cancer | volume = 15 | issue = 11 | pages = 1285–91 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17375339 | doi = 10.1007/s00520-007-0248-5  }}</ref>

Olanzapine has been considered as part of an [[early intervention in psychosis|early psychosis]] approach for schizophrenia.  The Prevention through Risk Identification, Management, and Education (PRIME) study, funded by the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] and Eli Lilly, tested the hypothesis that olanzapine might prevent the onset of psychosis in people at very high risk for [[schizophrenia]]. The study examined 60 patients with [[Prodrome|prodromal]] schizophrenia, who were at an estimated risk of 36–54% of developing schizophrenia within a year, and treated half with olanzapine and half with [[placebo]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=McGlashan TH, Zipursky RB, Perkins D, Addington J, Miller TJ, Woods SW, Hawkins KA, Hoffman R, Lindborg S, Tohen M, Breier A | title = The PRIME North America randomized double-blind clinical trial of olanzapine versus placebo in patients at risk of being prodromally symptomatic for psychosis | journal = Schizophrenia Research | volume = 61 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–18 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12648731 | doi = 10.1016/S0920-9964(02)00439-5 }}</ref> In this study, patients receiving olanzapine did not have a [[statistically significant|significantly]] lower risk of progressing to psychosis.
