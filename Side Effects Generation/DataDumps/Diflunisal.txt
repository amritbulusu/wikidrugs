'''Diflunisal''' is a [[salicylic acid]] derivative with analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity. It was developed by [[Merck Sharp & Dohme]] in 1971, as MK647, after showing promise in a research project studying more potent chemical analogs of [[aspirin]].<ref>{{Cite journal

}}</ref> It was first sold under the brand name '''Dolobid''', marketed by [[Merck & Co.]], but generic versions are now widely available. It is classed as a [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] (NSAID) and is available in 250&nbsp;mg and 500&nbsp;mg tablets.

==Mechanism of action==
Like all NSAIDs, diflunisal acts by inhibiting the production of [[prostaglandin]]s,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wallace|first1=J. L.|title=Prostaglandins, NSAIDs, and Gastric Mucosal Protection: Why Doesn't the Stomach Digest Itself?|journal=Physiological Reviews|date=1 October 2008|volume=88|issue=4|pages=1547–1565|doi=10.1152/physrev.00004.2008|pmid=18923189}}</ref> hormones which are involved in inflammation and pain. Diflunisal also has an [[antipyretic]] effect, but this is not a recommended use of the drug.<ref name=Tempero1977/>

It has been found to inhibit [[EP300|p300]] and [[CREB-binding protein]] (CBP), which are epigenetic regulators that control the levels of proteins that cause inflammation or are involved in cell growth.<ref>[http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/new-metabolic-pathway-reveals-aspirin-like-compound-s-anti-cancer-properties/81252777/ New Metabolic Pathway Reveals Aspirin-Like Compound’s Anti-Cancer Properties. June 2016]</ref>

==Duration of effect==
Though diflunisal has an onset time of 1 hour, and maximum [[analgesia]] at 2 to 3 hours, the plasma levels of diflunisal will not be steady until repeated doses are taken.<ref name=Tempero1977>{{cite journal |last1=Tempero|first1=KF |last2=Cirillo|first2=VJ |last3=Steelman|first3=SL |title=Diflunisal: a review of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, drug interactions, and special tolerability studies in humans.|journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology|date=Feb 1977 |volume=4 Suppl 1|pages=31S–36S|pmid=328032|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.1977.tb04511.x |pmc=1428837}}</ref> The long plasma half-life is a distinctive feature of diflunisal in comparison to similar drugs. To increase the rate at which the diflunisal plasma levels become steady, a loading dose is usually used. It is primarily used to treat symptoms of [[arthritis]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brogden|first1=RN|last2=Heel|first2=RC|last3=Pakes|first3=GE|last4=Speight|first4=TM|last5=Avery|first5=GS|title=Diflunisal: a review of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic use in pain and musculoskeletal strains and sprains and pain in osteoarthritis.|journal=Drugs|date=Feb 1980 |volume=19|issue=2|pages=84–106|pmid=6988202|doi=10.2165/00003495-198019020-00002}}</ref> and for acute pain following oral surgery, especially removal of [[wisdom teeth]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lawton|first1=GM|last2=Chapman|first2=PJ|title=Diflunisal--a long-acting non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug.

Effectiveness of diflunisal is similar to other NSAIDs, but the duration of action is twelve hours or more. This means fewer doses per day are required for chronic administration. In acute use, it is popular in dentistry when a single dose after oral surgery can maintain analgesia until the patient is asleep that night.

==Side effects==

=== Gastrointestinal ===
The inhibition of prostaglandins has the effect of decreasing the protection given to the stomach from its own acid. Like all NSAIDS, this leads to an increased risk of stomach ulcers, and their complications, with long-term use. Elderly users of diflunisal are at greater risk for serious GI events.

*Increased risk of GI events including bleeding, ulceration, and stomach or intestine perforation.
*Abdominal pain or cramps
*Constipation
*Gas
*Diarrhea
*Nausea and vomiting
*Dyspepsia

=== Cardiovascular ===
*Irregular heart beat
*Possible increased risk of serious and potentially fatal cardiovascular thrombotic events, MI, and stroke 
*Risks may increase with duration of use and for cardiovascular disease history

=== Ear, nose, throat, and eye ===
*Ringing in the ears
*Yellowing of eyes

=== Central nervous system ===
*Drowsiness
*Dizziness
*Headache
*Insomnia
*Fatigue
*Somnolence
*Nervousness

=== Skin ===
*Swelling of the feet, ankles, lower legs, and hands
*Yellowing of skin
*Rash
*Ecchymosis

== Contraindications ==

* [[Hypersensitivity]] to aspirin/NSAID-induced [[asthma]] or [[urticaria]]
* [[Aspirin triad]]
* 3rd [[:wikt:trimester|trimester]] [[pregnancy]]
* [[Coronary artery bypass surgery]] ([[peri-op]] pain)

==Cautions==
{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
{{colbegin|3}}
*Cardiovascular diseases
*Cardiac risk factors
*Hypertension
*Congestive heart failure
*Elderly or debilitated
*Impaired liver function
*Impaired kidney function
*Dehydration
*Fluid retention
*History of gastrointestinal bleeds/PUD
*Asthma
*Coagulopathy

*Corticosteriod use
*Anticoagulant use
*Alcohol use
*Diuretic use
*[[ACE inhibitor]] use

==Overdose==
Deaths that have occurred from diflunisal usually involved mixed drugs and or extremely high dosage. The oral {{LD50}} is 500&nbsp;mg/kg. Symptoms of overdose include coma, [[tachycardia]], stupor, and vomiting. The lowest dose without the presence of other medicines which caused death was 15&nbsp;grams. Mixed with other medicines, a death at 7.5&nbsp;grams has also occurred. Diflunisal usually comes in 250 or 500&nbsp;mg, making it relatively hard to overdose by accident.
