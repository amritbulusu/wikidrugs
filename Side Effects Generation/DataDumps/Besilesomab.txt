'''Besilesomab''' (trade name '''Scintimun''') is a [[mouse]] [[monoclonal antibody]] labelled with the radioactive isotope [[technetium-99m]]. It is used to detect inflammatory lesions and [[metastases]]. It binds to an [[immunoglobulin]], IgG1 [[isotype (immunology)|isotype]]. SCINTIMUN has been used since 1992 mainly in Hungary, Czech Republic, and Switzerland on the basis of local marketing authorizations, and in Germany (on the basis of individual prescription). Between 1992 and 2009, an estimated 90,000 patients has been studied. In 2009, the [[European Medicines Agency|EMEA]] has approved SCINTIMUN for marketing in all European countries.<ref>[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/druginfo/INN_2005_list54.pdf WHO Drug Information]</ref><ref>
