STS-135 launched on 8 July 2011, and landed on 21 July 2011, following a one-day mission extension. The four-person crew was the smallest of any shuttle mission since [[STS-6]] in April 1983. The mission's primary cargo was the [[Multi-Purpose Logistics Module]] (MPLM) ''[[Raffaello MPLM|Raffaello]]'' and a Lightweight Multi-Purpose Carrier (LMC), which were delivered to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS). The flight of ''Raffaello'' marked the only time that ''Atlantis'' carried an MPLM.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/06/sts-135-final-flights-timeline-takes-shape/ |title=STS-135/ULF-7 – The Final Flight's Timeline Takes Shape|author=Chris Gebhardt| publisher = NASA space flight |date=17 June 2011|accessdate=9 July 2011}}</ref>

Although the mission was authorized, it initially had no appropriation in the [[NASA]] budget, raising questions about whether the mission would fly.

During an address at the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] on 16 November 2010, NASA administrator [[Charles Bolden]] said that the agency needed to fly STS-135 to the station in 2011 due to possible delays in the development of commercial rockets and spacecraft designed to transport cargo to the ISS. "We are hoping to fly a third shuttle mission (in addition to [[STS-133]] and [[STS-134]]) in June 2011, what everybody calls the launch-on-need mission...and that's really needed to [buy down] the risk for the development time for commercial cargo," Bolden said.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.spacenews.com/civil/101119-extra-flights-needed-hedge-cots-delays.html |title=Bolden Says Extra Shuttle Flight Needed As Hedge Against Additional COTS Delays |first=Amy|last=Svitak|publisher=Space News|date=19 November 2010| accessdate= 27 November 2010}}</ref>

==Payload==
STS-135 delivered supplies and equipment to provision the space station through 2012, following the end of NASA's space shuttle program. Since the ISS program was extended to 2024,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Malick|first1=Tariq|title=International Space Station Gets Life Extension Through 2024|url=http://www.space.com/24208-international-space-station-extension-2024.html|accessdate=19 March 2017|work=Space.com|date=8 January 2014}}</ref> the station is resupplied by the [[Commercial Orbital Transportation Services]] program which took over resupply missions from the Shuttle. A shuttle extension beyond STS-135 wasn't seriously considered, <!--the entire space station won't be complete until the MLM laboratory module is launched in 2012, the USOS is now complete, however some US media outlets and official sources are stating incorrectly that the entire station is complete, this is not the case according to NASA, more information is available on the ISS page, media section, or the NASA manifest for the ISS -->and an ISS extension was never intended to be a guaranteed shuttle program extension,<ref>Since NASA had even before 2009 terminated many contracts with suppliers, shut down many facilities, and terminated or transferred many employees required to keep the Space Shuttles flying, any extension of the shuttle program at this point (for multiple flights after STS-135) would require a substantial portion of the expenses necessary to start the program in the late 1970s.

===Multi-Purpose Logistics Module===
The [[Multi-Purpose Logistics Module]] (MPLM) ''[[Raffaello MPLM|Raffaello]]'' made up the majority of the payload. This was ''Raffaello''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s fourth trip to the International Space Station since 2001 and the 12th use of an MPLM. Unlike previous MPLM missions that delivered large compartments and devices to outfit the space station laboratories, STS-135 delivered only bags and supply containers. The MPLM was filled with 16 resupply racks, which is the maximum that it could handle. Eight Resupply Stowage Platforms (RSPs), two Integrated Stowage Platforms (ISPs), six Resupply Stowage Racks (RSRs) and one Zero-G Stowage Rack (ZSR), which sits above another rack during transport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/566071main_135_press_kit2.pdf|title=STS-135 Press Kit (PDF)|publisher=NASA|date=July 2011|accessdate=11 January 2013}}</ref>

On flight day 4, ''Raffaello'' was lifted out of ''Atlantis'''s payload bay using the station's Canadarm2. It was berthed to nadir port of the Harmony node. After completing the cargo transfers to the ISS, ''Raffaello'' was loaded with almost {{convert|5700|lb|kg}} of unneeded equipment and station waste to be brought back to Earth. On flight day 11, the MPLM was detached from Harmony and was secured in the cargo bay of the shuttle.

===Lightweight Multi-Purpose Carrier===
The Lightweight Multi-Purpose Carrier (LMC) was also carried on STS-135. The External Thermal Cooling System (ETCS) Pump Module (PM) stored on [[ESP-2]], which failed and was replaced on orbit in August 2010, rode home on the LMC so that a failure analysis can be performed on the ground. The Robotic Refueling Mission rode up to the station on the underside of the LMC and was placed onto the ELC-4.

===Robotic Refueling Mission===
{{main article|Robotic Refueling Mission}}
[[File:Robotic Refueling Mission.ogv|thumb|350px|Video of the Robotic Refueling Mission.]]
''Atlantis'' carried the Robotic Refueling Mission (RRM) developed by the Satellite Servicing Capabilities project at the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] (GSFC).<ref>{{cite web|title=Robotic Refueling Mission (RRM)|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/RRM.html|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=5 August 2011}}</ref>  It planned to demonstrate the technology and tools to refuel satellites in orbit by robotic means.<ref name="RRM">{{cite web|url=http://www.spacenews.com/civil/100402-nasa-plans-refuel-mock-satellite.html|title=NASA Plans To Refuel Mock Satellite at the Space Station|author=Debra Werner|publisher=SPACE NEWS|date=2 April 2010|accessdate=10 March 2011}}</ref> After the proof of concept, the long-term goal of NASA is to transfer the technology to the commercial sector.<ref name="RRM" />

RRM included four tools, each with electronics and two cameras and lights.

=== Picosatellite Solar Cell Testbed 2 ===
{{main article|PSSC-2}}
Space Shuttle ''Atlantis'' carried a miniaturised satellite known as PSSC-2, or Picosatellite Solar Cell Testbed 2 into orbit. PSSC-2 was successfully deployed from the shuttle's cargo bay on flight day 13, becoming the 180th and last Space Shuttle payload to be placed into orbit.

===TriDAR===
{{unreferenced|section|date=July 2017}}
The mission was furthermore the third flight of the [[TriDAR]] sensor package designated DTO-701A (Detailed Test Objective), a 3D dual-sensing laser camera, intended for use as an autonomous rendezvous and docking sensor. It was developed by [[Neptec Design Group]] and funded by NASA and the [[Canadian Space Agency]]. TriDAR had previously flown on [[STS-128]] and [[STS-131]], aboard Space Shuttle ''Discovery''. TriDAR provides guidance information that can be used for rendezvous and docking operations in orbit, planetary landings and vehicle inspection/navigation of unmanned rovers. It does not rely on any reference markers, such as reflectors, positioned on the target spacecraft, instead using a laser-based 3D sensor and a thermal imager. Geometric information contained in successive 3D images is matched against the known shape of the target object to calculate its position and orientation in real-time.

The sensor was emplaced on the exterior airlock truss next to a Trajectory Control System (TCS) sensor. The TriDAR hardware was installed in ''Atlantis'''s payload bay on 6 April 2011. On STS-135, TriDAR was used to demonstrate technology for autonomous rendezvous and docking in orbit.

===Down-mass payload===
STS-135 returned to Earth carrying several items of [[downmass]] payload.  The [[Major incidents involving the International Space Station#2010 .E2.80.93 Failure in cooling loop A|failed ammonia Pump Module]] that was replaced in August 2010 was returned inside ''Atlantis'''s payload bay, on the upper side of the LMC. Also, a problematic Common Cabin Air Assembly (CCAA) Heat Exchanger (HX) was expected to be returned inside the [[Multi-Purpose Logistics Module|MPLM]]. The shuttle also brought back material, including experiments, in its middeck lockers. Since STS-135 only had four crew members, astronauts did not occupy the middeck and as a result compared to previous shuttle missions to the Space Station, it had additional storage space.

[[File:STS-135 Atlantis approaches the VAB.jpg|right|thumb|''Atlantis'' makes its rollover to the VAB.]]
[[Space Shuttle external tank|External Tank]] 138 (ET-138) was produced at the [[Michoud Assembly Facility]] (MAF) in New Orleans and arrived at the Kennedy Space Center on the Pegasus barge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2010/07/right-oms-pod-re-installation-et-138-arrives-sts-134/|title=Right OMS Pod set for re-installation as ET-138 arrives at KSC for STS-134|author=Chris Bergin|publisher=NASAspaceflight.com|date=13 July 2010|accessdate=29 April 2011}}</ref> After offloading, the tank was transported into a checkout cell inside the VAB on 14 July 2010.

NASA initially planned for [[STS-134]] (''Endeavour'') to fly with the newer ET-138 and for the LON STS-335 (''Atlantis'') mission to utilize the refurbished ET-122 only in the event that a rescue of ''Endeavour''{{'}}s crew were required. During Hurricane Katrina, ET-122 was damaged at the Michoud Assembly Facility (MAF) in New Orleans and while the tank was certified as completely flight-worthy after its repairs were completed, NASA management ruled that ET-122 posed a slightly higher risk of losing foam from the repaired areas and therefore assigned it to the STS-335 mission that would likely never fly. However, once it was decided to fly ''Atlantis'' on a full STS-135 mission, the tank assignments were swapped so that in the event STS-134 (''Endeavour'') were to suffer damage from ET-122, ''Atlantis'' with the newer and less risky ET-138 would be poised to rescue ''Endeavour''{{'}}s crew.<ref name=nsf0810>{{Cite web|title=Managers delay STS-134 ET/SRB mate ahead of tank allocation options|date=24 August 2010|first=Chris |last=Bergin |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2010/08/managers-delay-sts-134-etsrb-mate-ahead-of-tank-allocation-options/|publisher=NASAspaceflight.com}}</ref>

In early December 2010, ground technicians installed the main engines on ''Atlantis''. The Shuttle received the center engine on 7 December 2010, followed by the lower-right engine and the lower-left on 8 and 9 December 2010 respectively inside [[Orbiter Processing Facility]] (OPF-1). The event marked the last set of main engines ever to be installed on a space shuttle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts135/101210ssme/|title=Final set of shuttle main engines installed|publisher=Spaceflightnow.com|date=10 December 2010|accessdate=10 December 2010}}</ref>

Stacking operations of the Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) for the mission commenced in the evening hours of 29 March 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts135/110329srb/|title=Stacking of final shuttle rocket boosters underway|author=Justin Ray|publisher=Spaceflight Now|date=29 March 2011|accessdate=2 April 2011}}</ref> Technicians inside the VAB, lifted the left-aft segment from the handling crate and carefully maneuvered into High Bay No. 1 and finally onto the mobile launch platform. The booster stacking was completed in mid April. The completed boosters had a mixture of refurbished and unflown elements (11 sections on each booster). For example, the forward dome for the right-hand booster is new, while the upper cylinder on the left booster flew with [[STS-1]] – the historic maiden flight of [[Space Shuttle Columbia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts135/110418srbs/|title=Booster stacking finished for final shuttle flight|author=Justin Ray|publisher=Spaceflight Now|date=18 April 2011|accessdate=29 April 2011}}</ref> (For detailed information on the STS-135 boosters, see<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts135/fdf/135srbs.pdf|title=Case Use HistorySTS-135,&nbsp;June 2011 Flight Set 114|publisher=Spaceflight Now|accessdate=29 April 2011}}</ref>)

===Visit by President Obama's family===
President [[Barack Obama]], his wife [[Michelle Obama]], and their daughters, [[Family of Barack Obama#Malia and Sasha Obama|Malia and Sasha]], viewed ''Atlantis'' at the [[Orbiter Processing Facility]] (OPF-1) on their visit to the [[Kennedy Space Center]] on 29 April 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42828058/ns/technology_and_science-space/|title=Obama visits wounded congresswoman at space center|publisher=Space msnbc.com|author=Alan Boyle|date=30 April 2011|accessdate=30 April 2011}}</ref> The president's family missed the launch of ''Endeavour'' on the [[STS-134]] mission, as the first launch attempt was scrubbed due to problems with two heaters on one of ''Endeavour''{{'}}s [[auxiliary power unit]]s (APUs).

During their tour of the Orbiter Processing Facility, the president's family was accompanied by [[United Space Alliance]] tile technician Terry White and astronaut [[Janet Kavandi]]. Standing under the wings of space shuttle ''Atlantis'', White gave the president and his family an informal tutorial.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2011/04/obama-visits-cape-canaveral/1|title=Obama visits Cape Canaveral|author=Mimi Hall|work=USA TODAY |date=29 April 2011|accessdate=1 May 2011}}</ref>

===Rollover===

Inside the VAB transfer aisle, lifting operations to rotate ''Atlantis'' vertically commenced on 18 May 2011. The crane that hoisted the shuttle placed it into the adjacent high bay. ''Atlantis'' was next lowered to meet up with the external tank and the two solid rocket boosters. The mating operations were completed on 19 May 2011. On the same day, NASA officially announced 8 July 2011 as the intended launch date of the STS-135 mission.

===Rollout===
''Atlantis'' was rolled out to Launch Pad 39A on 1 June.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/rss/atlantis_update.xml|title=STS 135 RSS Feed – Atlantis Updates|author=NASA|publisher=NASA|date=1 June 2011|accessdate=1 June 2011}}</ref> The first motion of ''Atlantis'' out of the Vehicle Assembly Building began at 20:42 EDT on 31 May 2011.

Large crowds, including the families of NASA's workforce, were present during the rollout. The STS-135 crew was also at the Kennedy Space Center to witness the last-ever rollout of a Space Shuttle. The crew participated in an informal Question & Answer session with news media, which was aired live on [[NASA TV]]. While ''Atlantis'' was rolled out to the launch pad, ''Endeavour'' was landing a few miles away at the Shuttle Landing Facility, touching down on Kennedy Space Center's Runway 15 at 02:34 EDT after completing its final mission, STS-134.

===External tank fueling test===
''Atlantis''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s external tank for the STS-135 mission was put through a tanking test on 15 June 2011 to check the health of the tank's stringers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/06/sts-135-et-138-tanking-test-following-weather-delay/|title=STS-135: ET-138 Tanking Test reveals SSME Fuel Valve issue|author=Chris Bergin|publisher=NASAspaceflight.com|date=15 June 2011|accessdate=25 June 2011}}</ref> It was slightly delayed due to a lightning storm which passed over the Kennedy Space Center. During the test, technicians detected a hydrogen fuel valve leak in ''Atlantis''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s main engine No. 3, as it recorded temperatures below normal levels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts135/110616plans/index.html|title=Atlantis tank inspections, engine valve swap on tap|author=William Harwood|publisher=SPACEflight Now|date=16 June 2011|accessdate=25 June 2011}}</ref> The leaking hydrogen valve was replaced on 21 June.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts135/110622status/|title=Shuttle tank inspections going well, valve replaced|author=William Harwood|date=22 June 2011|accessdate=25 June 2011}}</ref>

On 18 June, engineers also commenced X-ray inspections to verify the performance of the radius block doublers that were installed over the top of the stringers. The stringers form the backbone of ET-138's central "intertank" compartment that separates the upper liquid oxygen tank from the larger liquid hydrogen tank below. The installation of the doublers on ET-138 was ordered after engineers found stringer cracks in the tank used for ''Discovery''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[STS-133]] mission. Technicians finished all X-ray scans of the stringers on 24 June, well ahead of schedule. After analyzing the results, they found no issues.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The STS-135 payload canister's move to Launch Pad 39A began in the night of 16 June.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universetoday.com/86826/final-payload-for-final-shuttle-flight-delivered-to-the-launch-pad/|title=Final Payload for Final Shuttle Flight Delivered to the Launch Pad|author=Ken Kremer|publisher=UNIVERSE TODAY|date=18 June 2011|accessdate=25 June 2011}}</ref> The canister's lifting up of the pad structure to place it into the cleanroom happened on the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts135/110619payloads/|title=Shuttle Atlantis receives payloads for space station|author=Justin Ray|publisher=Spaceflight NOW|date=19 June 2011|accessdate=25 June 2011}}</ref> Technicians at the launch pad closed the Rotating Service Structure (RSS) back around ''Atlantis'' to gain access to the orbiter's payload bay. The payload bay doors were opened on the night of 18 June and the cargo was installed into the shuttle's payload bay on 20 June.

===Terminal countdown demonstration test===
The STS-135 crew then traveled to Kennedy Space Center, arriving in T-38 training jets just after 17:30 EDT on 20 June to take part in the countdown dress rehearsal and emergency training drills.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts135/110620tcdt/|title=Shuttle crew comes to town for practice countdown|author=Justin Ray|date=20 June 2011|accessdate=25 June 2011}}</ref> After the arrival, the four astronauts spoke to reporters at the runway and acknowledged the historic nature of the final shuttle mission. "We're incredibly proud to represent the final flight," noted the commander, Chris Ferguson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/06/sts-135-crew-arrives-tcdt-mfv-work-begins-ssme-3/|title=STS-135: Crew arrives for TCDT as MFV work begins on SSME-3|author=Chris Bergin|publisher=NASAspaceflight.com|date=21 June 2011|accessdate=25 June 2011}}</ref> During the training, the crew spent time learning pad 39A evacuation procedures and test-drove an armored tank available for the astronauts to escape the area.

Shuttle Launch Integration Manager Michael P. Moses also issued a waiver for return to landing site (RTLS) weather. Later at the post-launch news conference, Mr. Moses explained that his decision was based on the fact although a few showers that were popping up within the {{convert|20|nmi|km|adj=on}} radius from the Shuttle Landing Facility at RTLS landing were a launch constraint, the showers would have been cleared by the time of a RTLS landing (if it did) 35 minutes later.

At the end of the poll Mr. Leinbach told the crew "Good luck to you and your crew on the final flight of this true American icon. Good luck, godspeed and have a little fun up there" to which commander Chris Ferguson replied "Thanks to you and your team Mike, We're completing a chapter of a journey that will never end. The crew of Atlantis is ready to launch".

At T-31 seconds, just before Atlantis's computers were supposed to take control of the flight, the launch countdown clock stopped. This was because of a lack of an indication that the Gaseous Oxygen Vent Arm had retracted and properly latched, a problem that had never occurred during previous launches in the program's history. Soon the launch team was able to verify the Vent Arm's position with the help of a closed circuit camera, and the countdown clock resumed after approximately 2 minutes, 18 seconds.

The final flight of Space Shuttle Atlantis launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] on 8 July at 11:29:03.9 EDT with launch commentator [[George Diller]] saying, "Two, one, zero and liftoff!

These included the 64 seconds OMS-2 burn which pushed Atlantis into a 230 x 158&nbsp;km orbit and the NC-1 engine firing for 94 seconds to adjust the shuttle's orbital path to match with the Space Station. The NC-1 firing altered the shuttle's velocity by about {{convert|144.7|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}.

NASA held a post-launch news conference at 12:10 CDT with Bill Gerstenmaier, [[Robert D. Cabana|Robert Cabana]] (director of NASA's John F. Kennedy Space Center), Mike Moses and Mike Leinbach.

After opening the shuttle's payload bay doors at 17:03:20 GMT, the crew began configuring Atlantis for on-orbit operations. The [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] antenna was deployed and the self-test was completed with satisfactory results.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/07/sts-135-ascent-reviews-point-superb-launch-performance-atlantis/|title=STS-135: Initial Ascent Reviews point to superb launch performance by Atlantis|author=Chris Bergin|publisher=NASAspaceflight.com|date=8 July 2011|accessdate=8 July 2011}}</ref> CAPCOM astronaut Barry Wilmore radioed the crew from mission control in Houston, reporting that a preliminary analysis found no signs of any significant debris or impact damage during the ascent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts135/110708launch/|title=America's space shuttle blasts off on one last mission|author=William Harwood|publisher=Spaceflight Now|date=8 July 2011|accessdate=9 July 2011}}</ref> Commander Ferguson and Pilot Hurley also powered up the Shuttle's Robotic Arm and checked its functions ahead of next day's planned thermal protection survey.

=== 9 July (Flight Day 2 – TPS survey) ===
[[File:STS-135 Chris Ferguson and Doug Hurley on the flight deck.jpg|right|thumb|Chris Ferguson and Doug Hurley on the flight deck of ''Atlantis''.]]
A crowd at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center greeted the crew with a unique "good morning" call. "Good morning ''Atlantis'', the Marshall Space Flight Center hopes you enjoyed your ride to orbit."<ref name="sat02">{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts135/news/STS-135-02.html|title=STS-135 MCC Status Report #02|author=NASA|publisher=NASA|date=9 July 2011|accessdate=10 July 2011}}</ref>  We wish you a successful mission and a safe return home," the workers said in a recorded video message.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/12228-final-space-shuttle-mission-smooth-start-atlantis.html|title=Final Shuttle Mission Off to Super Smooth Start, NASA Says|author=Tariq Malik|publisher=SPACE.com|date=9 July 2011|accessdate=10 July 2011}}</ref>

The main objective of the day was to inspect ''Atlantis'''s thermal protection system, using the shuttle's robotic arm and the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) to look for any signs of launch damage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/567942main_fd02_expk.pdf|title=STS-135/ULF7 FD02 Execute Package|author=NASA|publisher=NASA|date=9 July 2011|accessdate=10 July 2011}}</ref> To do so, Commander Ferguson, Pilot Hurley and Mission Specialist Magnus used the shuttle's robotic arm and the OBSS to get a close up look at [[reinforced carbon–carbon]] wing leading edges and the nose cap of the shuttle. The robotic arm grappled the OBSS at 6:58&nbsp;a.m. EDT. After raising out the arm-boom assembly, the crew activated the camera and laser sensor package on the boom to first scan the starboard wing. The nose cap was surveyed next followed by the port wing. The gathered visual and electronic data were downlinked during numerous Ku band communication opportunities to the ground. With imagery on their hand, experts began to review the data. The heat shield survey started around 11:00 [[UTC]], was wrapped about five hours later. In his NASA TV commentary, NASA Public Affairs Officer, Rob Navias, said that most of the time, the crew worked ahead of schedule opting to take meals while working. The crew received high praise for their efficient work from the Mission Control Houston including CAPCOM astronaut [[Stephen Robinson]] who communicated with them during the survey.

While the TPS survey was under way, Mission Specialist Walheim spent much of his afternoon on the shuttle's middeck. He worked to prepare items carried into orbit there for transfer to the space station.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts135/news/STS-135-03.html|title=STS-135 MCC Status Report #03|author=NASA|publisher=NASA|date=9 July 2011|accessdate=10 July 2011}}</ref> Later in the day, Walheim worked with Hurley to check out the rendezvous tools that would be used during ''Atlantis'''s docking with the ISS on Flight Day 3. Meanwhile, Ferguson and Magnus installed the center-line camera in the window of the shuttle's hatch for a view that would help them align ''Atlantis'' with the space station.

The NC2 and NC3 course correction burns were also performed during Flight Day 2 to change the flight path of ''Atlantis'' en route to the ISS. The NC3 maneuver lasted seven seconds and changed the shuttle's velocity by about {{convert|1.5|ft/s|m/s}}. Aboard the ISS, the Expedition 28 crew completed the pressurization of Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA-2), located at the forward docking port of the Harmony module, ahead of the shuttle's docking. Crew members Fossum, Volkov and Furukawa also held a meeting with the ground imagery experts to discuss the planned photography shoot during ''Atlantis'''s [[rendezvous pitch maneuver]] (RPM).

During the mission status briefing from the Johnson Space Flight Center (JSC), shuttle flight director [[Kwatsi Alibaruho]] said that ''Atlantis'' was off to one of the smoothest starts of any mission in the 30-year history of NASA's shuttle program. He told reporters, "I think this is certainly one of the better starts that we have seen".{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===10 July (Flight Day 3 – Docking)===
[[File:STS135 nadir view of Atlantis prior to docking.jpg|thumb|right|Top view of Atlantis prior to docking.]]
The STS-135 crew began their day at 07:29 UTC and prepared to dock with the ISS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts135/news/STS-135-04.html|title=STS-135 MCC Status Report #04 |author=NASA|publisher=NASA|date=10 July 2011|accessdate=13 July 2011}}</ref> The crew encountered a minor problem when Atlantis's General Purpose Computer (GPC3) failed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/07/sts-135-atlantis-docks-iss-wleids-review-rcc-panels/|title=STS-135: Atlantis docks with the ISS – WLEIDS review on RCC panels|author=Chris Bergin|publisher=NASAspaceflight.com|date=10 July 2011|accessdate=13 July 2011}}</ref> However, this held no impacts for the rendezvous and docking operations as two GPCs proved sufficient.

Commander Chris Ferguson and pilot Douglas Hurley performed a series of rendezvous burns (NH, NC4, NCC, MC1-4 and TI) to boost the orbit of Atlantis to match with that of the ISS. At 11:40 UTC, with about 9 miles (14&nbsp;km) separating the shuttle and the ISS, Ferguson performed the final 12-second terminal initiation (TI) burn, firing the left OMS engine of Atlantis at 12:29 UTC. It placed the shuttle {{convert|1,000|ft|m}} below the Space Station at 13:51 UTC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/blogs/space/index.jsp?plckController=Blog&plckScript=blogScript&plckElementId=blogDest&plckBlogPage=BlogViewPost&plckPostId=Blog%3a04ce340e-4b63-4d23-9695-d49ab661f385Post%3af3eb68f2-d04f-412c-9798-aa089093e395|title=Atlantis Astronauts Dock With International Space Station|author=Mark Carreau|publisher=AVIATION WEEK|date=10 July 2011|accessdate=13 July 2011}}</ref> By 13:26 UTC, with Ferguson flying Atlantis from the aft flight deck, the shuttle positioned {{convert|600|ft|m}} beneath the ISS and began the 360-degree flip rendezvous pitch maneuver (RPM). As the shuttle's underside rotated into view, three of the [[Expedition 28]] ISS crew members – Sergei Volkov, Mike Fossum and Satoshi Furukawa using cameras with 1000&nbsp;mm, 800&nbsp;mm and 400&nbsp;mm lenses, respectively, photographed Atlantis's under belly for 90 seconds, as part of post-launch inspections of the thermal protection system. The photos were being sent to mission control in Houston to be evaluated by experts on the ground to look for any damage.

Atlantis docked with the ISS Pressurized Mating Adapter-2 at 15:07 UTC as the two orbited 220 miles (350&nbsp;km) over the South Pacific Ocean east of New Zealand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/12230-shuttle-atlantis-space-station-final-docking.html|title=Shuttle Atlantis Docks at Space Station for Last Time|author=Denise Chow|publisher=SPACE.com|date=10 July 2011|accessdate=13 July 2011}}</ref> This was Atlantis's 19th docking to a Space Station. "Houston, station, Atlantis, capture confirmed and we see free drift," radioed Hurley, confirming the successful docking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts135/110710fd3/index2.html|title=Atlantis gracefully docks to International Space Station|author=William Harwood|date=10 July 2011|accessdate=13 July 2011}}</ref> In reply, "Atlantis arriving," said Ron Garan after the ceremonial ringing of the station's bell.

Shortly afterwards, the shuttle crew floated into the station's Harmony module at 16:55 UTC. After a brief welcoming ceremony by the station crew, Atlantis's astronauts received the standard station safety briefing.

The crew then got to work with Ferguson and Hurley using the shuttle arm to take its OBSS from the station's Canadarm2 operated by Garan and Furukawa. The station arm had plucked the OBSS from its stowage position on the shuttle cargo bay sill. The handoff was to prepare to use the boom for any shuttle heat shield late inspections if required. Magnus worked with TV setup and Walheim transferred spacewalk gear.

During Flight Day 3, flight controllers began monitoring reports from the Department of Defense's U.S. Strategic Command that an orbital debris piece of the Russian satellite COSMOS 375 may come near the station and shuttle complex about noon the next day. The team updated tracking information following the docking and determined that no course correction maneuver was necessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Space_debris_will_not_approach_station_NASA_999.html|title=Space debris will not approach station: NASA|date=11 July 2011|accessdate=14 July 2011|author=Staff Writers|publisher=SPACE DAILY}}</ref>

===11 July (Flight Day 4 – MPLM installation)===
[[File:STS-135 Sandy Magnus floats freely in the Raffaello MPLM.jpg|right|thumb|Sandy Magnus floats freely inside the ''Raffaello'' MPLM.]]
The main objective of Flight Day 4 was to install the ''Raffaello'' MPLM on the nadir port of the station's Harmony module.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts135/110711fd4/index2.html|title=Space station resupply pod hoisted from Atlantis's bay|author=William Harwood|publisher=SPACEFLIGHT NOW|date=11 July 2011|accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref> The crew started their day in space at 7:02 the song Tubthumping by Chumbawamba was played to wake the astronauts up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts135/news/STS-135-06.html|title=STS-135 MCC Status Report #06|author=NASA|publisher=NASA|date=11 July 2011|accessdate=14 July 2011}}</ref> Mission Specialist Sandra Magnus, along with Pilot Doug Hurley, used the Canadarm2, beginning at 9:09 UTC, to remove the ''Raffaello'' module from the payload bay of ''Atlantis''. The two installed the MPLM on the Harmony node at 10:46 UTC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/12234-shuttle-atlantis-space-station-cargo-delivery.html|title=At Space Station, Shuttle Astronauts Make Last Big Delivery|publisher=SPACE.com|author=Denise Chow|date=11 July 2011|accessdate=14 July 2011}}</ref> After leak checks, hatches between ''Raffaello'' and the ISS were opened before noon.

Because ''Atlantis'' launched on time with a full load of onboard consumables for its electricity-generating fuel cells, and due to power saving operations employed during the first three days, on Flight Day 4, NASA's managers approved a one-day mission extension. According to NASA, the mission was extended primarily to allow the crew spend more time on cargo transfers. CAPCOM [[Megan McArthur]] also notified commander Chris Ferguson that the Mission Management Team determined had decided not to do a Focused Inspection of the Atlantis's heat shield. The Damage Assessment Team had only found one tile ding along with four areas of minor damage to insulating blankets, said chairman Leroy Cain during the day's Mission Management Briefing aired on NASA TV.

===12 July (Flight Day 5 – Station spacewalk)===
[[File:STS-135 EVA Mike Fossum 5.jpg|right|thumb|Mike Fossum suspended on the end of the Canadarm2 during the spacewalk.]]
Flight day 5 saw Expedition 28 Flight Engineers Mike Fossum and Ron Garan perform a spacewalk.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts135/news/STS-135-08.html|title=STS-135 MCC Status Report #08|author=NASA|publisher=NASA|date=12 July 2011|accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref> Because of a short training flow and a requirement to launch the shuttle with a reduced crew of four, NASA opted not to utilize two spacewalkers from the STS-135 crew. The main tasks for the spacewalk included retrieving a failed pump module from an external stowage platform of the ISS for return to Earth inside shuttle's cargo bay, installing two experiments and repairing a new base for the station's robotic arm. The spacewalk began at 13:22 UTC (NASA Rule). For identification, Fossum's [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit|EMU]] spacesuit had red stripes around the legs, while Garan's had no markings. The spacewalkers used Canadarm2 to retrieve the pump module which failed in 2010. Operated by STS-135 Pilot Hurley and Mission Specialist Magnus in the station's cupola, Garan rode Canadarm2 to the pump module's stowage platform where he and Fossum removed it. Still on the arm, Garan took the pump module inside Atlantis's payload bay. There Fossum bolted it into place on the LMC. The astronauts next removed the Robotics Refueling Mission (RRM) experiment from the payload bay. Fossum, now on the arm, carried the experiment to a platform on [[Dextre]] for temporary storage, while Garan cleaned up tools and equipment in the payload bay of Atlantis. Recognizing the historical significance, "Take a look around, Ronny, You're the last EVA person in the payload bay of a shuttle." radioed Mission Specialist Rex Walheim, who served as the intra-vehicular officer to coordinate the spacewalk, from Atlantis's flight deck.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts135/110712fd5/index2.html|title=Final spacewalk in the space shuttle era is complete|author=William Harwood|date=12 July 2011|accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref>

Upon completion of the installation, Fossum moved to the front of the Zarya module and freed a wire stuck in one latch door at a data grapple fixture. The fixture had been installed during [[STS-134]], the previous shuttle mission. The grapple fixture serves as a base for Canadarm2, considerably extending its range of operation on the Russian segment of the ISS. Garan also deployed a materials experiment ([[Materials International Space Station Experiment#MISSE-8|MISSE-8]]) that focuses on optical reflector materials, also installed during STS-134, on Express Logistics Carrier (ELC-2) FRAM-3 site on the station's starboard truss. Back together again, Fossum and Garan moved on to the Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA-3) on the Tranquility node. They installed an insulating cover on the end of the adapter, an area exposed to considerable sunshine.

The two astronauts completed the six-hour, 31-minute spacewalk at 19:53 UTC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts135/news/STS-135-09.html|title=STS-135 MCC Status Report #09|author=NASA|publisher=NASA|date=12 July 2011|accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref> It was the 160th spacewalk in support of ISS assembly and maintenance and 249th spacewalk by U.S. astronauts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts135/110712fd5/index.html|title=Spacewalkers to stow broken pump into Atlantis's payload bay|author=William Harwood|publisher=Spaceflight NOW|date=12 July 2011|accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref> Inside the shuttle-station complex, transfer of material from the ''Raffaello'' MPLM began.

A urine processor in a U.S. toilet located in the Tranquility module was turned off since on Flight Day 4, as the astronauts reported a strong odor from the equipment. The decision was made since during the spacewalk, Hurley and Magnus used a robotics work station in the cupola.

===13 July (Flight Day 6 – Cargo transfers)===
[[File:STS-135 Atlantis and Southern Lights.jpg|right|thumb|[[Aurora Australis]] and a number of stars are visible as the Atlantis-Station complex passes over the southern hemisphere.]]
Atlantis crew received a special wakeup message from Sir [[Elton John]] to start flight day 6.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/12257-astronauts-unpack-giant-space-station-locker.html|title=Astronauts Unpack Giant Space Locker in Orbit|author=Denise Chow|publisher=SPACE.com|date=13 July 2011|accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref> The message followed the day's wakeup song which was played at 6:29 UTC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts135/news/STS-135-10.html|title=STS-135 MCC Status Report #10 |author=NASA|date=13 July 2011|accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref> Atlantis's crew focused on unpacking supplies from the ''Raffaello'' MPLM. The crew started the day 26 percent through the combined 15,069 pounds of cargo to transfer in or out of ''Raffaello''. The MPLM was launched with 9,403 pounds of cargo and it is expected to return 5,666 pounds when Atlantis lands. The supplies and equipment that Atlantis astronauts delivered to the orbiting outpost is expected to keep the station well supplied through 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts135/110713fd6/index2.html|title=Astronauts now focusing on hectic cargo transfer work|author=William Harwood|date=13 July 2011|accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref>

The crew had some help from the station crew of Andrey Borisenko, Sergei Volkov and Satoshi Furukawa in the transfer operations. Crew members also opened the Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA-3), attached to the Tranquility node, and stored some of the material from ''Raffaello'' there. Station lead flight director Chris Edelen said at an afternoon briefing that about 50% of the cargo had been moved from ''Raffaello'' and the shuttle's middeck to the space station.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts135/news/STS-135-11.html|title=STS-135 MCC Status Report #11 |author=NASA|date=13 July 2011|accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref>

All four shuttle crew members took some time out of their work at 16:54 UTC to talk with reporters from WBNG-TV and WICZ-TV in [[Binghamton]], [[New York (state)|New York]], near Pilot Doug Hurley's home town of [[Apalachin]] and KGO-TV of [[San Francisco]].

On the day, Space Shuttle Discovery also moved from the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF-2) to the nearby Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) to enter storage. The move was planned to house Atlantis in OPF-2 after landing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts133/rollovergallery/|title=Discovery leaves hangar to make room for Atlantis|author=Justin Ray|publisher=Spaceflight Now|date=13 July 2011|accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref>

===14 July (Flight Day 7 – Cargo transfers/Off-duty)===
[[File:STS-135 ISS-28 The All-American Meal 4.jpg|right|thumb|Shuttle and Station crews in the middeck of Atlantis during the "All American Meal".]]
Flight Day 7 saw crew unpacking more cargo from the ''Raffaello'' MPLM.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts135/news/STS-135-12.html|title=STS-135 MCC Status Report #12|author=NASA|publisher=NASA|date=14 July 2011|accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref>

The crew also took some time off to participate in several special events. At 10:59 UTC, Commander Ferguson and Mission Specialist Magnus spoke with reporters from [[Fox News]] Radio and KTVI-TV and KSDK-TV in [[St. Louis]]. Then, at about 13:20 UTC, the entire crew was interviewed by WBBM-TV in [[Chicago]], KTVU-TV in [[Oakland]], [[California]], and WTXF-TV in [[Philadelphia]]. Afterward the shuttle crew had most of the afternoon off.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts135/news/STS-135-13.html|title=STS-135 MCC Status Report #13|author=NASA|publisher=NASA|date=14 July 2011|accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref>  For supper, both the Atlantis and station crews enjoyed a special "All-American Meal" of barbecue brisket or grilled chicken and baked beans, southwestern corn and apple pie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts135/american_meal.html|title=Special American Meal Planned for Final Space Shuttle Crew|author=NASA|publisher=NASA|date=11 July 2011|accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref> NASA invited the public to share in it, virtually.

NASA on flight day 7 released the video captured by cameras mounted on each of Atlantis's solid rocket boosters showing the launch of the shuttle.

The shuttle astronauts went to sleep as planned but were awakened by the sound of a master alarm on board Atlantis at 22:07 GMT. The tone signaled a failure with one of Atlantis's five [[IBM AP-101]] General Purpose Computers (GPCs) No. 4.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/12291-shuttle-atlantis-onboard-computer-glitch.html|title=Space Shuttle Computer Failure Wakes Sleeping Astronauts|author=Denise Chow|publisher=SPACE.com|accessdate=16 July 2011|date=14 July 2011}}</ref> The alarm prompted Commander Ferguson to head to Atlantis and evaluate the issue. GPC-4 was running system management software at the time of failure. Ferguson with the help of Ground Control later transferred the failed GPC's programs onto GPC-2. The transfer took about 45 minutes, bypassing an expected period of loss of signal by utilizing communications at White Sands, [[New Mexico]]. After activating GPC-2 and with Atlantis in good shape, Ferguson and other crew members went back to sleep. "You all have done an absolutely fabulous job. We have polled the room, everyone is ready for you to go back to sleep," radioed CAPCOM [[Shannon Lucid]] from Mission Control.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectspace.com/flightdayjournal/sts-135/07.html|title=Computer failure wakes Atlantis' astronauts|date=14 July 2011|accessdate=16 July 2011|publisher=collectSPACE.com}}</ref>

As a result of the extra time spent on fixing the GPC-4 issue, Mission Control extended the crew sleep period by 30 minutes. Although no root cause was immediately identified, ground controllers immediately ruled out any connection between GPC-4 malfunction and the problem suffered by GPC-3 ahead of docking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/07/sts-135-gpc-4-issue-tps-clearance-overview/|title=STS-135: GPC-4 issue awakens crew – TPS clearance overview|author=Chris Gebhardt and Chris Bergin|date=14 July 2011|accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref>

===15 July (Flight Day 8 – Cargo transfers)===
[[File:STS-135 and Expedition 28 joint group portrait.jpg|right|thumb|Shuttle and Station crew members pose for a portrait.]]
The crew awakened at 4:59 UTC to a special message and a song from Sir Paul McCartney.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts135/news/STS-135-14.html|title=STS-135 MCC Status Report #14|author=NASA|publisher=NASA|date=15 July 2011|accessdate=17 July 2011}}</ref> The wake up call was 30 minutes later than Atlantis's crew had been scheduled in order to give them time to make up sleep they lost over the course of the night due to the failure of GPC-4. Early on the day, Atlantis commander Ferguson and pilot Hurley re-loaded software and successfully restarted the GPC-4.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts135/110715fd8/index.html|title=Astronauts restart computer; Obama to call Atlantis today|author=William Harwood|publisher=Spaceflight Now|date=15 July 2011|accessdate=17 July 2011}}</ref> Flight controllers in Houston also downloaded data dumps to carefully monitor the computer to make sure that it was running normally.

While Ferguson and Hurley focused on computer troubleshooting, Mission Specialists Magnus and Walheim together with the station crew continued to work on cargo transfers between Atlantis the Space Station. Walheim also transferred EMU/airlock items to Atlantis that won't be needed in the post-shuttle era.

Several media interviews happened at about 10:45 UTC. Ferguson and Doug Hurley talked with representatives of CBS Radio, KYW-TV in [[Philadelphia]] and [[Associated Press]]. Next, beginning at 12:04 UTC all STS-135 crew members talked with WPVI-TV and KYW Radio, both of [[Philadelphia]], and Reuters. At the 45-minute crew news conference, Atlantis crew members and their station colleagues gathered in the Japanese Kibo Laboratory to take questions from news media. Reporters at four NASA centers, NASA headquarters and in Japan participated.

President Barack Obama, at about 16:30 UTC also called the combined Expedition 28 and Atlantis crews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts135/110715fd8/index3.html|title=Obama calls space to praise shuttle and station crews|author=William Harwood|publisher=Spaceflight Now|date=15 July 2011|accessdate=17 July 2011}}</ref> He thanked those who had supported the shuttle program and said that he was proud of all the crew members. Shuttle Commander Chris Ferguson said that all the partners on the station were honored to represent their home countries in this multinational effort and station Flight Engineer Sergei Volkov described the station and shuttle crews, from three nations, as "one big family".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts135/news/STS-135-15.html|title=STS-135 MCC Status Report #15|author=NASA|publisher=NASA|date=15 July 2011|accessdate=17 July 2011}}</ref>

During the Mission Status Briefing, the STS-135 lead flight director Mr. [[Kwatsi Alibaruho]] said that transfers were right on timeline with 70% complete. The crew was ahead of timeline on earlier days but the computer problem caused to slow them down. He further mentioned that the latch on Atlantis's middeck locker for LiOH canisters is broken, and as a result, the entire panel had been fastened to floor with fasteners. The LiOH canisters are used to scrub Carbon Dioxide from the cabin air inside the shuttle. When Atlantis is docked to the Space station, the station Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050210002_2005208618.pdf|title=International Space Station Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (ISS CDRA) Concepts and Advancements|author=Dina El Sherif and James C. Knox|publisher=NASA|accessdate=17 July 2011}}</ref> takes care of both the station's and Atlantis's air revitalization. However, when Atlantis flies solo after undocking, LiOH canisters are required. Regarding the GPC-4 issue, Mr. Alibaruho said that it was a very infrequent failure, happened before only on [[STS-9]] and the last time a problem occurred on GPC 4 was on Atlantis's [[STS-71]] mission.

===16 July (Flight Day 9 – Cargo transfers)===
[[File:STS-135 Sandy Magnus in the Cupola.jpg|right|thumb|Astronaut Sandra Magnus in the cupola.]]
Flight day 9 was the bonus day added by the Mission Management Team earlier on the week as a result of Atlantis having been able to save enough cryogenic Oxygen and Hydrogen to power its fuel cells an extra day. Throughout the day, the four member STS-135 crew spent more time to move supplies and equipment between the ISS and the ''Raffaello'' MPLM.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts135/news/STS-135-17.html|title=STS-135 MCC Status Report #17|author=NASA|publisher=NASA|date=16 July 2011|accessdate=18 July 2011}}</ref>

Early on the day, Commander Ferguson and Pilot Hurley also spent some time working to successfully repair the door that gives the crew access to the LiOH canisters. Mission Specialist Magnus spent about an hour and a half in the morning taking microbial air samples on various locations in the space station. The collected samples will be returned for study and further analysis. Magnus also worked the Japanese Experiment Module Remote Manipulator System (JEMRMS). Mission Specialist Walheim along with station crew member Mike Fossum continued work with spacewalking equipment in the Quest airlock. Some of them will be left on the station, and will be utilized during an upcoming Russian spacewalks on 3 August 2011. Hurley working with station crew member Ron Garan stored some of the cargo in Atlantis's middeck to be returned. Since no astronaut was riding in the mid-deck, on the way back, it was expected to be fully packed with 1564 pounds of cargo. Among cargo brought to the space station, 2281 pounds were also in the mid-deck.

The STS-135 crew also provided a recorded message as a tribute to Atlantis, the entire Space Shuttle Program and team. In the message, Ferguson spoke about the U.S. flag displayed behind them that was flown on the first space shuttle mission, [[STS-1]]. It was flown on this mission to be presented to the space station crew. The flag will remain displayed on board the space station until the next crew launched from the U.S. retrieves it for return to Earth.

In a video celebrating the centennial of naval aviation, Commander Ferguson and Pilot Hurley also paid tribute to U.S. naval aviators. Among many those who have made significant contributions to the manned U.S. space program, Hurley mentioned several names such as [[Alan Shepard]], the first American to fly in space; [[John Glenn]], the first American to orbit the Earth; [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Eugene Cernan]], the first and last humans to set foot on the moon; [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]], the first pilots of the Space Shuttle; and Ferguson and Hurley, the commander and the pilot of the current (last) shuttle flight.

Just before the crew prepared to go for sleep, CAPCOM Megan McArthur notified them that the flight controllers thought that the GPC-4 failure was caused by a [[single event upset]] (teams on the ground listed a [[Coronal Mass Ejection]] as one of three potential contributing factors)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/07/sts-135-sun-may-contributed-atlantis-gpc-4-issue/|title=STS-135: The Sun may have contributed to Atlantis's GPC-4 issue|author=Chris Bergin|publisher=NASAspaceflight.com|date=16 July 2011|accessdate=18 July 2011}}</ref> and that GPC-4 was a healthy machine. Furthermore, she mentioned that the plan was to assign systems management (SM) to GPC-4 the next morning and if no further problems arose, it was to be kept for undocking.

===17 July (Flight Day 10 – Cargo transfers/Off duty)===

On Flight Day 10, the crew of Atlantis wrapped up the transfer work inside the ''Raffaello'' MPLM. During the Mission Status Briefing, Space Station lead Flight Director Chris Edelen said that "They (crew) reached a key milestone today in that the ''Raffaello'' logistics module was closed out, all the cargo that (came) up to space station has been transferred over, that was actually completed a couple of days ago, and today they've packed ''Raffaello'' with all the return cargo that's going to be coming back to Earth".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts135/110717fd10/index2.html|title=Station restocking completed by shuttle Atlantis crew|author=William Harwood|date=17 July 2011|accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref> STS-135 delivered 9403 pounds of cargo in the MPLM up to the space station and the crew packed up 5666 pounds of returning cargo inside the MPLM. The crew also installed the control and power assemblies in the hatch leading into the MPLM. On the next day, the controllers were used to drive the bolts to release the MPLM from Node 2.

At 10:10 UTC, pilot Doug Hurley and Mission Specialist Rex Walheim answered videotaped questions from students at NASA Explorer Schools across the United States. It was the last interactive educational event conducted by a space shuttle crew.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts135/news/STS-135-19.html|title=STS-135 MCC Status Report #19 |author=NASA|date=17 July 2011|accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref>

After their midday meal, Mission Specialist Sandra Magnus and Commander Chris Ferguson worked a little over an hour continuing to move experiments and equipment to and from Atlantis's middeck. At the end 84% of middeck transfers were completed. The crew transferred a new science refrigerator (GLACIER) from the Shuttle's middeck to the Space Station. Another couple of noteworthy middeck payloads that were transferred included the mass spectrometer in the mass constituent analyzer, a device in the U.S. segment that samples air from different parts of the station to determine its constituents. Flight Engineer Ron Garan removed the broken spectrometer and moved it to Atlantis's middeck for return. The suspect gyroscope in the TVIS treadmill located in the Russian segment removed by Flight Engineer [[Sergey Alexandrovich Volkov]] was also placed in the middeck. After completing those transfers, the shuttle crew had most of the afternoon off.

NASA TV also showed a recorded video in which Magnus, a soccer enthusiast and Station Flight Engineer Satoshi Furukawa cheer on their country's women's world cup soccer teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bnd.com/2011/07/17/1789323/magnus-cheers-us-women-in-world.html#ixzz1SqdQf6p8|title=Magnus cheers U.S. women in World Cup final|author=Jacqueline Lee|publisher=Belleville News Democrat|date=17 July 2011|accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref> On 17 July, the U.S. team played against Japan, in the [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup]] final in [[Hannover]], [[Germany]]. Japan won the final on a penalty shoot-out following a 2–2 tie after extra time.

===18 July (Flight Day 11 – MPLM return, farewells/Hatch closure)===
[[File:Sun Rising on the Final Shuttle Mission.ogv|thumb|Silhouetted against the Earth, ''Atlantis'' flies into the rising Sun with the reinstalled MPLM.]]
The STS-135 crew returned the MPLM back to Atlantis's payload bay on flight day 12, closed the hatches between the Space Station and the Shuttle and prepared for next day's undocking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts135/news/STS-135-20.html|title=STS-135 MCC Status Report #20|author=NASA|publisher=NASA|date=17 July 2011|accessdate=23 July 2011}}</ref>

Beginning at 5:03 UTC, the hatches separating ''Raffaello'' MPLM and the ISS were closed. With station's Canadarm2 locked onto ''Raffaello'', commands were issued at 10:14 UTC to begin the releasing operations of the 16 motorized bolts holding the MPLM in place on the station's Node 2. Arm operators, Mission Specialist Magnus and Pilot Hurley working inside the cupola, un-berthed ''Raffaello'' at 10:48 UTC and moved it back to Atlantis's payload bay. The move was completed by around 11:48 UTC. The securing of the ''Raffaello'' in the shuttle's payload bay marked the 10th and final transfer of an MPLM in the history of the Space Shuttle program.
Atlantis and Space Station crew members said their goodbyes and closed hatches between the two spacecraft at 14:28 UTC, ending seven days, 21 hours, 41 minutes of joined docked operations.<ref name="status report 21">{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts135/news/STS-135-21.html|title=STS-135 MCC Status Report #21|author=NASA|publisher=NASA|date=17 July 2011|accessdate=23 July 2011}}</ref> [[File:STS-135 Harmony's hatch with U.S. flag - closeup - cropped.jpg|thumb|left|The flag left aboard]]At the farewell ceremony, Commander Ferguson presented to the station a small U.S. flag that had flown on STS-1. He also presented a shuttle model signed by program officials and the mission's lead shuttle and station flight directors. "What you don't see is the signatures of the tens of thousands who rose to orbit with us over the past 30 years, if only in spirit," Ferguson said.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts135/110718fd11/index2.html|title=Raffaello cargo module returned to shuttle bay|author=William Harwood|date=18 July 2011|accessdate=23 July 2011|publisher=Spaceflight NOW}}</ref>

Ferguson thanked Expedition 28 commander Andrey Borisenko for the hospitality and his crew's help in making the mission a success. Borisenko replied by wishing the shuttle crew a safe trip home and happy landings. Station Flight Engineer Ron Garan especially thanked Magnus for her "load master" activity of moving cargo between the two spacecraft.

Shortly after hatches between the two spacecraft were closed, the crew returned to ''Atlantis''. They carried out tasks to prepare for the undocking from the Space Station. Ferguson and Hurley installed the centerline camera while hatch leak checks were still under way. Hurley and Walheim also checked out the rendezvous tools.

===19 July (Flight Day 12 – Undocking)===

[[File:STS 135 ISS From Atlantis.jpg|left|thumb|The first released image of the ISS taken by ''Atlantis'''s crew as the shuttle departed the Space Station.]]
Space Shuttle Atlantis undocked from the Space Station early on flight day 12, marking the end of shuttle visits to the orbiting outpost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts135/news/STS-135-22.html|title=STS-135 MCC Status Report #22|publisher=NASA|author=NASA|date=19 July 2011|accessdate=23 July 2011}}</ref> With pilot Douglas Hurley at the control, undocking occurred at 6:28 UTC as the two spacecraft flew through orbital night above the Pacific Ocean east of Christchurch, New Zealand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts135/110719fd12/index3.html|title=International Space Station bids goodbye to the shuttle|author=William Harwood|publisher=Spaceflight NOW|date=19 July 2011|accessdate=23 July 2011}}</ref> Shortly after, in keeping with naval tradition, flight engineer Ron Garan rang the station's bell in the Harmony module, and said "Atlantis, departing the International Space Station for the last time."

After undocking, Atlantis moved away, to a station keeping point about {{convert|600|ft|m}} ahead of the ISS. Before beginning a final half-lap unique fly, pilot Doug Hurley paused the shuttle by firing thrusters for a moment and during this time the space station changed its orientation by rotating 90 degrees to the right.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/12338-final-shuttle-astronauts-final-farewell-space-station.html|title=Last Shuttle Astronauts Bid Historic Farewell to Space Station | author = Clara Moskowitz|publisher=SPACE.com|date=19 July 2011|accessdate=23 July 2011}}</ref> That gave Atlantis crew a good opportunity to take still camera photographs and shoot video of station areas not normally documented in previous shuttle fly-arounds. The images are expected to help experts on the ground to get additional information on the station's conditions. The half-lap fly around which began around 7:30 UTC was completed about 25 minutes later.

Teams in both shuttle and station flight control rooms in Houston were working their last shuttle shift. Commander Ferguson thanked the Orbit 1 team of shuttle flight controllers headed by Flight Director Kwatsi Alibaruho. He urged them to pause a moment on their way out and "make a memory." From the station flight control room, CAPCOM [[Daniel Tani]], told Ferguson that it had been "a pleasure and an honor" to support the mission. "We are proud to be the last of a countless line of mission control teams who have watched while shuttles visited the ISS. The ISS wouldn't be here without the shuttle," noted Tani. "It's been an incredible ride. On behalf of the four of us, we're really appreciative we had the opportunity to work with you on this pivotal mission," replied Ferguson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts135/news/STS-135-23.html|title=STS-135 MCC Status Report #23|publisher=NASA|author=NASA|date=19 July 2011|accessdate=23 July 2011}}</ref>

At the end of the half-loop, ''Atlantis'' did two TI separation burns, the second at 8:18 UTC to move away from the vicinity of the space station.

After their midday meal, Ferguson, Hurley and Mission Specialist Sandra Magnus did the late survey of ''Atlantis'''s heat shield, focused on the reinforced carbon carbon (RCC) of the wing leading edges and the nose cap. They used the shuttle's RMS and its {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} OBSS to look first at the starboard wing, then the nose cap and finally the port wing. The crew completed the inspections at 2:30 UTC. Magnus and ground engineers began reviewing the collected data to verify that shuttle's TPS has received no impact damage from micrometeoroids or space junk during its docked operations or fly-around of the station. At the end of a highly successful day in space, the crew members went to bed at 4:59 UTC.

{{Rquote|right|One more satellite takes its place in the sky,
The last of many that the shuttle let fly.

[[Magellan (spacecraft)|Magellan]], [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]], [[Hubble Telescope|Hubble]], and more,

Have sailed beyond her payload bay doors.

There've filled science books, and still more to come,

The shuttle's legacy will live on when her flying is done.

We wish [[PSSC-2|PicoSat]] success in space where it roams,

It can stay up here, but we're going home.

Yes soon for the last time we'll gently touch down,

Then celebrate the shuttle with our friends on the ground.

Flight day 13 was the final full day in space for the STS-135 crew. They spent the day checking out ''Atlantis''′s flight control surfaces and hot-firing its reaction control system (RCS) jets, making sure everything was ready for deorbit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts135/news/STS-135-24.html|title=STS-135 MCC Status Report #24|author=NASA|date=20 July 2011|accessdate=23 July 2011}}</ref> Mission managers cleared ''Atlantis'' for re-entry after reviewing results of the late inspection survey of the shuttle's heat shield, performed by the crew on the flight day 12.

''Atlantis'''s crew also deployed an 8.2-lb (3.7-kg), 5×5×10-inch technology demonstration picosatellite, the Pico-Satellite Solar Cell experiment ([[PSSC-2]]), into a low Earth orbit at around 360&nbsp;km,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/PSSC.html|title=Pico-Satellite Solar Cell Experiment (PSSC) |author=NASA |publisher=NASA |date=10 June 2011 |accessdate=24 July 2011}}</ref> from inside a spring ejection canister in the shuttle's payload bay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts135/news/STS-135-25.html|title=STS-135 MCC Status Report #25|author=NASA|date=20 July 2011|accessdate=23 July 2011}}</ref> The picosatellite relayed data back on the performance of its solar cells, which were based on new technology intended for use on future satellites. PSSC-2, which was deployed at 7:54 UTC, was the 180th and final payload deployed by a Space Shuttle. Shortly after, CAPCOM astronaut [[Barry Wilmore]] congratulated the crew from the ground on the successful deployment. Mission specialist Rex Walheim marked the milestone by reciting an original poem. "Outstanding, Rex, we applaud you," Wilmore said amid cheers from the Houston Flight Control Room.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/12354-final-space-shuttle-satellite-deployment-picosat.html|title=Space Shuttle Releases Final Satellite Into Orbit|author=Clara Moskowitz|publisher=SPACE.com|date=20 July 2011|accessdate=23 July 2011}}</ref>

The crew also participated in one last round of interviews with reporters on the ground. At 8:44 UTC, the crew talked with ABC News, CBS News, CNN, Fox News and NBC News.

Later in the day, the crew finished their final preparations for ''Atlantis''’s planned landing. Commander Ferguson and Pilot Hurley practiced landing procedures with a video game-like simulator,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts135/110720fd13/index.html|title=Astronauts ready Atlantis for Thursday's predawn landing|author=William Harwood|publisher=Spaceflight NOW|date=20 July 2011|accessdate=23 July 2011}}</ref> the Portable Inflight Landing Operations Trainer (PILOT). At 6:15 UTC, Ferguson, Hurley and Walheim powered up one of the APUs to conduct OPS-8 activities. This process verified the functionality of ''Atlantis'''s flight control surfaces, actuating the rudder, speed brakes, wing and tail body flaps which guided the shuttle through the atmosphere. They then stowed the Ku-Band antenna at 10:34 a.m. EDT and went to sleep.

The [[Empire State Building]] in New York City paid tribute to 30 years of space shuttle flights by lighting up in red, white and blue throughout the night of 20 July.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.esbnyc.com/current_events_tower_lights.asp | title=Tower Lights – Empire State Building | accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref>

Recognizing the conclusion of an era, Mission Commentator Rob Navias declared on nose wheel touchdown "Having fired the imagination of a generation, a ship like no other, its place in history secured, the shuttle pulls into port for the last time. Its voyage, at an end." Just after wheels stop, also recognizing the historical enormity of the final landing, Commander Chris Ferguson said "Mission complete, Houston, After serving the world for over 30 years, the shuttle has earned its place in history, and it has come to a final stop." to which Entry CAPCOM Barry Wilmore replied "We congratulate you, ''Atlantis'', as well as the thousands of passionate individuals across this great space faring nation who truly empowered this incredible spacecraft which has inspired millions around the globe."

Hundreds turned out at Kennedy Space Center to witness the last-ever landing of a space shuttle. An estimated 4,000 shuttle program workers also gathered to watch TV coverage at the Johnson Space Center in [[Texas]]. Inside Mission Control, team members shook hands, hugged and took pictures of each other savoring the historical occasion.

After working through the checklists to safely power down the shuttle, the crew egressed Atlantis into the Crew Transport Vehicle (CTV). Shortly after, the Houston Mission Control Center handed over Atlantis to the landing convoy at the KSC. The crew performed the traditional walk-around of the shuttle after walking down the stairs from the CTV. On the runway, they also met NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, NASA Deputy Administrator Lori Garver, KSC Center Director Robert Cabana, shuttle program manager John Shannon, launch director Mike Leinbach, Atlantis flow manager Angie Brewer, and other NASA officials. Charles Bolden and Commander Ferguson spoke briefly on the tarmac. Feguson did note that the door to the Waste Collection System in shuttle's mid-deck flew open during entry. After the speech, the crew got into the AstroVan for the ride to the crew quarters building where they spend the night before returning to Houston on the next day.

Atlantis was towed back to Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF-2) where a walk-around for NASA/Kennedy Space Center employees was held. Following the event, the shuttle was returned to OPF-2 vacated by Space Shuttle Discovery on 13 July where technicians processed Atlantis in preparation for the shuttle's retirement as a museum exhibit in the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/07/atlantis-down-processing-mer-review-notes-flawless-return/ |title=Atlantis into down processing after MER review notes flawless return |author=Chris Bergin |date=22 July 2011 |accessdate=24 July 2011 |publisher=NASAspaceflight.com}}</ref>

A [[pledge of allegiance]] followed from KSC children, and NASA Administrator Charles Bolden and KSC Director Robert Cabana spoke to the shuttle program employees. During the event, Rita Wilcoxson and Patricia Stratton were presented with highest NASA honors: the Distinguished Service Medal and the Distinguished Public Service Medal respectively. The citations on both were identical, stating "for continuous outstanding leadership contributions provided to the nation's space shuttle program". A public "welcome home" ceremony was held for ''Atlantis'' at Houston's Ellington Field Hangar 990 on 22 July.<ref>[http://www.marylynnedittmar.com/?p=1085 "Final Shuttle Crew Welcome Ceremony Today"].

==Wake-up calls==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the [[Gemini program]], and first used music to wake up a flight crew during [[Apollo 15]]. Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts' families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.<ref name="chronology">{{cite news|title=Chronology of Wakeup Calls| date=2 August 2005| publisher= NASA| url= https://history.nasa.gov/wakeup.htm|accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref>

For STS-135, some of the wake-up calls were accompanied by greetings, from either the performing artist or NASA employees.
