'''Methasterone''' (nickname '''Superdrol'''), also known as '''methyldrostanolone''', is an [[oral administration|orally active]] [[anabolic-androgenic steroid]] (AAS) that was never marketed through legitimate channels for medicinal purposes. It was brought to market, instead, in a clandestine fashion as a “[[designer drug|designer steroid]].” [[Mebolazine]] is formed by hydrazone formation between 2 equivalents of methasterone with 1 equivalent of hydrazine.

==Medical use==
Methasterone was never a commercially available prescription drug. Its non-17α-alkylated counterpart, [[drostanolone propionate]], was commercialized by Syntex Corporation under the brand name Masteron.<ref>{{cite web | title = Superdrol, masteron en oxy komen uit hetzelfde nest" [Superdrol, Masteron, and Oxy come from the same nest] | publisher = Ergogenics.org | accessdate=February 2009 | url = http://www.ergogenics.org/157.html}}</ref>

==Non-medical use==
Methasterone resurfaced in 2005 as a “designer steroid”.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Van Enoo, Peter  |author2=Frans T. Delbeke  |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Metabolism and excretion of anabolic steroids in doping control—New steroids and new insights | journal = Journal of Steroid Biochemistry & Molecular Biology | volume = 101 | date = 2006 | pages = 173 | doi=10.1016/j.jsbmb.2006.06.024}}</ref>  It was brought to market by Designer Supplements as the primary ingredient of a [[dietary supplement]] named Superdrol.  Its introduction into commerce may have represented an attempted circumvention of the U.S. [[Anabolic Steroids Control Act of 1990]] (along with its 2004 revision), since the law is, in part, drug-specific;<ref>{{cite web | publisher = Office of Divesion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration, Department of Justice | title = Implementation of the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004 | accessdate=February 2009 | url = http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/rules/2005/fr1216.htm}}</ref>  methasterone, as is the case with many designer steroids, was not declared a Schedule III class anabolic steroid in that act because it was not commercially available at the time the act, and its subsequent revision, were signed into law.<ref>{{cite news | author = Shipley, Amy, Bonnie Berkowitz and Christina Rivero | title = Designer Steroids Hide and Seek | journal = The Washington Post | date = October 18, 2005 | accessdate=February 2009 | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2005/10/18/GR2005101800648.html}}</ref> Methasterone was therefore being sold as an over-the-counter dietary supplement.

==Side effects==

Methasterone is [[hepatotoxic]] (toxic to the liver). Many cases of liver damage due to the use of methasterone have been cited in the medical literature.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Jasiurkowski, Beata, Jaya Raj, David Wisinger, Richard Carlson, Lixian Zou, and Abdul Nadir | title = Cholestatic Jaundice and IgA Nephropathy Induced by OTC Muscle Building Agent Superdrol | journal = American Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 101 | issue = 11 | date = 2006 | pages = 2659–2662 | doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.2006.00735.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Nasr, John  |author2=Jawad Ahmad  |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Severe Cholestasis and Renal Failure Associated with the Use of the Designer Steroid Superdrol (Methasteron): A Case Report and Literature Review | journal = Digestive  Diseases and Sciences | volume = 10 | pages = 1007 | date = 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = L.

Methasterone, also known as '''2α,17α-dimethyl-5α-dihydrotestosterone''' ('''2α,17α-dimethyl-DHT''') or as '''2α,17α-dimethyl-5α-androstan-17β-ol-3-one''', is a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]] [[androstane]] [[steroid]] and a [[17α-alkylated AAS|17α-alkylated]] [[chemical derivative|derivative]] of DHT.

==History==
The synthesis of methasterone is first mentioned in the literature in 1956 in connection with research conducted by [[Syntex|Syntex Corporation]] in order to discover a compound with anti-tumor properties.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=H. J. Ringold  |author2=G. Rosenkranz  |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Steroids. LXXXIII. Synthesis of 2-Methyl and 2,2-Dimethyl Hormone Analogs | journal = Journal of Organic Chemistry | volume = 21 | date = 1956 | pages = 1333–1335 | doi=10.1021/jo01117a625}}</ref> In a 1959 research journal article, it is initially mentioned and is elaborated upon where its method of synthesis is discussed in greater detail, its tumor inhibiting properties are verified, and it is noted as being a “potent orally active anabolic agent exhibiting only weak androgenic activity.”<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ringold, H. J., E. Batres, O. Halpern, and E. Necoechea | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | title = Steroids.

Vida | title = Androgens and Anabolic Agents:     Chemistry and Pharmacology | location = New York | publisher = Academic Press | date = 1969 | pages = 23 & 168}}</ref>

===Controversy and FDA involvement===
It was in late 2005 that the status of methasterone, in addition to that of four other designer steroids, as an anabolic steroid was brought to public awareness by an article published in the ''Washington Post''.<ref>{{cite news | author = Amy Shipley | title = Steroids Detected in Dietary Tablets | publisher = The Washington Post | date = November 30, 2005 | accessdate=February 2009 | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/29/AR2005112901636.html}}</ref>   Don Catlin of the UCLA Olympic Laboratory, who conducted the studies, noted methasterone’s similarity to drostanolone. A warning by the FDA was issued soon after to the general public as well as to the distributor, Designer Supplements LLC, for the marketing of this compound.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration | title = FDA Warns Manufacturers About Illegal Steroid Products Sold as Dietary Supplements | date=March 9, 2006| accessdate=February 2009 | url = http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2006/NEW01332.html}}</ref>   Methasterone was subsequently added to the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) list of prohibited substances in sport.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=World Anti-Doping Agency |title=The World Anti-Doping Code: The 2009 Prohibited List: International Standard |accessdate=February 2009 |url=http://www.wada-ama.org/rtecontent/document/2009_Prohibited_List_ENG_Final_20_Sept_08.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203030039/http://www.wada-ama.org/rtecontent/document/2009_Prohibited_List_ENG_Final_20_Sept_08.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-03 |df= }}</ref> Despite all of this, methasterone has resurfaced within the supplement industry on several occasions since its banning by WADA.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1155395/5/index.htm | date = May 18, 2009 | title = What You Don't Know Might Kill You: Would-be experts and untested products feed a $20 billion obsession with better performance across all levels of sports |author1=David Epstein |author2=George Dohrmann | publisher = Sports Illustrated}}</ref>
