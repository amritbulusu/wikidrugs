'''Schering AG''' was a research-centered [[Germany|German]] [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[pharmaceutical company]] headquartered in [[Wedding (Berlin)|Wedding]], [[Berlin]], which operated as an independent company from 1851 to 2006. In 2006 it was bought by [[Bayer|Bayer AG]] and merged to form the Bayer subsidiary [[Bayer Schering Pharma|Bayer Schering Pharma AG]], which was renamed [[Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals]] in 2011. Schering was listed on the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]] and had 26,000 employees as of 2004.

The American pharmaceutical company [[Schering-Plough]], formerly the Schering Corporation, was originally the US subsidiary of Schering AG, and merged with [[Merck & Co.]] in 2009.

==History==
In 1851, [[Ernst Christian Friedrich Schering]] opened the ''Grüne Apotheke'' (Green Pharmacy) in [[Berlin]]'s ''Chausseestraße'', and in 1871 converted into the name ''Chemische Fabrik auf Actien'' (formerly E. Schering). This date is the company's date of incorporation.

The company grew strongly in the following years. In 1913, the company employed 935 workers, 112 [[Master craftsman#Germany|master craftsman]] and 180 office employees. In addition to the Berlin site, two factories were also located in Russia ([[Moscow]] and Wydriza) with over 1,000 workers and a plant in [[Great Britain]]. Turnover at the time was about 10 million [[German gold mark]], created with the production of photochemicals and pharmaceuticals. Important products produced were [[salicylic acid]], the antigout preparation [[Cinchophen|atophan]], various sleeping and disinfecting agents.

At the beginning of the 1920s, Schering took over the wash and colouring company {{ill|W. Spindler|de}} located in the Berlin district ''Köpenick''. In 1922, the management acquired the majority of shares in the chemical factory ''Chemischen Fabrik auf Actien'' (formerly E. Schering) from the [[Upper Silesia|Upper Silesian]] {{ill|Oberschlesische Kokswerke und Chemische Fabriken|de}}.

In 1937, the companies ''Kokswerke und Chemische Fabriken AG'' and the ''Chemischen Fabrik auf Actien'' amalgamated with the sister company ''Schering-Kahlbaum AG'' and, on the same day, renamed on account of the internationally respected name ''Schering'' to ''Schering Aktiengesellschaft''. The pharmaceutical business thus became part of a mining and chemical group, which also produced [[Radiography|radiographic]] products and [[pesticide]] products.

At the time of the merger, the company employed more than 26,000 people in 140 subsidiaries worldwide.  Schering's annual gross revenue was nearly €5 billion (2003).

Schering AG focused on the business areas of [[gynaecology]], [[andrology]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[oncology]], and [[Contrast medium|contrast agents]]. Schering's best-known products are probably its brands of [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]s. Other key products included the [[Interferon beta-1b|interferon-beta]] brand Betaferon (Betaseron in North America) and the paramagnetic contrast agent [[Gadopentetic acid|Magnevist]].

The largest German manufacturing facility was located in [[Bergkamen]].
