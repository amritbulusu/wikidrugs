'''Ibutilide''' is a Class III [[antiarrhythmic]] agent that is indicated for acute cardioconversion of [[atrial fibrillation]] and [[atrial flutter]] of a recent onset to sinus rhythm. It exerts its antiarrhythmic effect by induction of slow inward sodium current, which prolongs action potential and [[refractory period (physiology)]] of myocardial cells. Because of its Class III antiarrhythmic activity, there should not be concomitant administration of Class Ia and Class III agents.

Ibutilide is marketed as '''Corvert''' by [[Pfizer]]. Administration resulted in successful heart rhythm control in 31-44% of patients within 90 minutes, with sustained polymorphic [[ventricular tachycardia]] in 0.9-2.5% of patients. It appears to show better results in atrial flutter as compared to atrial fibrillation.<ref name="RythmControl">{{cite journal | last1 = Kowey | first1 = PR | last2 = Stoenescu | first2 = ML | title = Selection of drugs in pursuit of a rhythm control strategy | journal = Progress in cardiovascular diseases | volume = 48 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–45 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16253653 | doi = 10.1016/j.pcad.2005.06.009 }}</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==
Unlike most other Class III antiarrhythmic drugs, ibutilide does not produce its prolongation of action potential via blockade of cardiac delayed rectifier of potassium current{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}, nor does it have a sodium-blocking, antiadrenergic, and calcium blocking activity that other Class III agents possess. Thus it is often referred as a “pure” Class III antiarrhythmic drug.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Ibutilide, like other class III antiarrhythmic drugs, blocks delayed rectified potassium current.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=K. T.|title=Ibutilide|journal=Circulation|date=10 February 1998|volume=97|issue=5|pages=493–497|doi=10.1161/01.CIR.97.5.493}}</ref>

It does have action on the slow sodium channel and promotes the influx of sodium through these slow channels.

Although potassium current seems to play a role, their interactions are complex and not well understood.<ref name=Howard>Howard, P.A., Ibutilide: An antiarrhythmic agent for the treatment of atrial fibrillation or flutter. Annals of Pharmacotherapy, 1999. 33(1): p. 38-47. {{PMID|9972384}}</ref> Ibutilide’s unique mechanism works by an activation of a specific inward sodium current, thus producing its therapeutic response in which a prolonged [[action potential]] increases myocytes’ cardiac refractoriness in case of atrial fibrillation and flutter.

== Pharmacokinetics ==

===Absorption===
Ibutilide is intravenously administered. It has a high first-pass metabolism, which results in a poor [[bioavailability]] when taken orally. Individual pharmacokinetic properties are highly viable during the clinical trial.<ref name=Howard/><ref name=PI>Pharmacia-Upjohn, Corvert (ibutilide fumarate) injection package insert. July 2002: Kalamazoo, MI.</ref>

===Distribution===
Ibutilide has a relatively large volume of distribution among individual subjects, which is about 11L/kg. Approximately 40% of the drug is bound with plasma albumin of healthy volunteers in a trial. This is also approximately close to patients with atrial fibrillation and flutter.<ref name=PI/>

===Metabolism===
Ibutilide has a high systemic plasma [[Clearance (medicine)|clearance]] that closes to the hepatic blood flow  (29mL/min/kg). Its metabolic pathway is via liver’s cytochrome P450 system by isoenzymes other than [[CYP3A4]] and [[CYP2D6]] by which the heptyl side chain of ibutilide is oxidized.<ref name=Howard/><ref name=PI/> With eight metabolites are detected in the urine, however, only one is an active metabolite that shares the similar electrophysiologic property of the Class III antiarrhythmic agents.<ref name=Howard/><ref name=PI/><ref>Kelly C. Rogers, P., and Douglas A. Wolfe MD, Ibutilide: A class III rapidly acting antidysrhythmic for atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Journal of Emergency Medicine  January 2001. Volume 20( Issue 1): p. 67-71.</ref> The plasma concentration of this metabolite is only less than 10% of ibutilide.<ref name=PI/>

===Excretion===
After administration of ibutilide, it is quickly excreted by renal pathway with a half-life of approximately 6 hours. Approximately 82% of a 0.01&nbsp;mg/kg dose is excreted in the urine during the trial. Among those, around 7% is excreted as unchanged drug. The reminder of the drug is excreted in feces (about 19%).<ref name=Howard/>

==Adverse effects and contraindications==
Like other antiarrhythmics, ibutilide can lead to [[arrhythmia|abnormal heart rhythms]] due to its ability to prolong the [[QT interval]], which can lead to the potentially fatal abnormal heart rhythm known as [[torsades de pointes]]. Consequently, the drug is contraindicated in patients that are likely to develop abnormal heart rhythms; this includes persons that have had [[polymorphic ventricular tachycardia]] in the past, have a long QT interval, [[sick sinus syndrome]], or a recent [[myocardial infarction]], among others.<ref name="Austria-Codex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Jasek, W|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2007|edition=2007/2008|volume=1|pages=1768–71|isbn=978-3-85200-181-4|language=German}}</ref>

== Patient Information ==
This medication will be given intravenously for your heart disease. You will have continuously ECG monitoring during the infusion and 4 hours after your infusion. Some of the minor side effects are headache and irregular heartbeat. If you experience chest pain and respiratory difficulties, you should report to your doctors immediately.<ref>Lexi-Comp, Lexi-Drugs Online : Ibutilide.</ref>
