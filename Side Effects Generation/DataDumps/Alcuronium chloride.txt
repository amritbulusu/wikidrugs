'''Alcuronium''' is a neuromuscular blocking (NMB) agent, alternatively referred to as a skeletal [[muscle relaxant]]. It is a semi-synthetic substance prepared from C-[[toxiferine]] I,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Foldes FF | title = The Mode of Action of Quaternary Ammonium Type Neuromuscular Blocking Agents | journal = Br.

The replacement of both the ''N''-methyl groups with ''N-allyl'' moieties yielded ''N,N''-diallyl-''bis''-nortoxiferine, now recognized as alcuronium (and at one time marketed as the proprietary agent called Alloferin).

Inclusion of the allylic functions presented an enhanced potential area of biotransformation, and thus alcuronium is observed to have a much shorter duration of neuromuscular blocking action than its parent C-toxiferine I.<ref>Martin-Smith M (1971), In: Ariens EJ (ed.), "Drug Design".

== Effects ==

* Cardiovascular system: histamine release and blockage of the sympathetic ganglia including adrenal medulla could cause hypotension 
* Respiratory: apnea due to phrenic blockage but bronchoconstriction can occur from the histamine release
* Central nervous system: no effect on intraoccular pressure
* Autonomic ganglion blockade can cause decrease in gut motility

== Special points ==

* Duration of action prolonged in states of low potassium, calcium and protein, also in states of high magnesium and acidosis.
* Pharmaceutically incompatible with [[thiopentone]]
* Infusion can cause fixed dilated pupils
