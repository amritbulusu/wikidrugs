'''Setipiprant''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) (developmental code names '''ACT-129,968''', '''KYTH-105''') is a [[pharmaceutical drug|drug]] originally developed by [[Actelion]] which acts as a selective, orally available [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of the [[prostaglandin DP2 receptor|prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub> receptor 2]] (DP<sub>2</sub>).<ref>Fretz H, Valdenaire A, Pothier J, Hilpert K, Gnerre C, Peter O, Leroy X, Riederer MA.

However, following the discovery in 2012 that the [[prostaglandin D2 receptor|prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub> receptor]] (DP/PGD<sub>2</sub>) is expressed at high levels in the scalp of men affected by [[male pattern baldness]],<ref>Garza LA, et al. Prostaglandin D2 inhibits hair growth and is elevated in bald scalp of men with androgenetic alopecia. ''Science Translational Medicine'', 21 March 2012; 4(126):126ra34. doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.3003122</ref> the rights to setipiprant were acquired by Kythera with a view to potentially developing this drug as a novel treatment for baldness, with a previously unexploited mechanism of action.<ref>[https://www.google.com/patents/US20150072963 George Cotsarelis, Garret Fitzgerald, Luis Garza. Compositions and methods for regulating hair growth. US Patent application 2015/0072963]</ref> While it is too early to tell whether setipiprant will be an effective treatment for this condition, the favorable pharmacokinetics and relative lack of side effects seen in earlier clinical trials mean that fresh clinical trials for this new application can be conducted fairly quickly.<ref>[http://www.kythera.com/products/kyth-105-setipiprant/ Pipeline KYTH-105 (setipiprant)]</ref>

A phase 2A study is underway to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of oral setipiprant relative to a [[placebo]] and the active comparator, [[finasteride]], in 18 to 41 years old males with androgenetic [[alopecia]].<ref>https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02781311?intr=ACT-129968+OR+Setipiprant&rank=4</ref>
