<!-- Definition and medical uses -->

== Medical uses ==
Ipratropium is administered by inhalation for the treatment of [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) and asthma exacerbation. For that purpose, it is supplied in a canister for use in an inhaler or in single dose vials for use in a nebulizer.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0000965/ Ipratropium Oral Inhalation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902155604/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0000965/ |date=2012-09-02 }} ''PubMed Health'' Retrieved May 28, 2012</ref>

It is also used to treat and prevent minor and moderate bronchial asthma, especially asthma that is accompanied by cardiovascular system diseases.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

It is also [[Ipratropium/salbutamol|combined with salbutamol]] ([[albuterol]] — [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]) under the trade names Combivent (a non-aerosol [[metered-dose inhaler]] or MDI) and Duoneb ([[nebulizer]]) for the management of [[COPD]] and [[asthma]], and with [[fenoterol]] (trade names Duovent and Berodual N) for the management of asthma.

Ipratropium as a nasal solution sprayed into the nostrils can reduce [[rhinorrhea]] but will not help nasal congestion.<ref>[http://www.drugs.com/pro/atrovent-nasal-spray.html Atrovent Nasal Spray] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111005137/http://www.drugs.com/pro/atrovent-nasal-spray.html |date=2012-01-11 }} ''Drugs.com'' Retrieved May 28, 2012</ref>

Combination with [[Beta2-adrenergic agonist|beta-adrenergic agonists]] increases the dilating effect on the bronchi.

==Contraindications==
The main contraindication for inhaled ipratropium is [[hypersensitivity]] to [[atropine]] and related substances. For oral administration, contraindications are similar to other anticholinergics; they include narrow angle [[glaucoma]] and obstructions in the [[gastrointestinal tract]] and [[urinary system]].<ref name="AustriaCodex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2009|edition=2009/2010|isbn=3-85200-196-X|language=German}}</ref><ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile">{{cite book|title=Arzneistoff-Profile|editor=Dinnendahl, V |editor2=Fricke, U|publisher=Govi Pharmazeutischer Verlag|location=Eschborn, Germany|year=2010|edition=23|volume=2|isbn=978-3-7741-9846-3|language=German}}</ref>

===Peanut allergy===
Previously atrovent inhalers used [[chlorofluorocarbon]] (CFC) as a propellant and contained [[soy lecithin]] in the propellant ingredients.  In 2008 all CFC inhalers were phased out and [[hydrofluoroalkane]] (HFA) inhalers replaced them. [[Peanut allergy|Allergy to peanuts]] was noted for the inhaler as a contraindication but now is not. It has never been a contraindication when administered as a nebulized solution.<ref>[http://emsmedrx.wordpress.com/2011/03/21/ipratropium-soybean-and-nuts-allergy-myth-dispelled/ Ipratropium Soybean and Nuts Allergy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513115025/http://emsmedrx.wordpress.com/2011/03/21/ipratropium-soybean-and-nuts-allergy-myth-dispelled/ |date=2012-05-13 }} ''EMSMedRx'' Retrieved April 6, 2013</ref>

==Side effects==
If ipratropium is inhaled, side effects resembling those of other [[anticholinergic]]s are minimal. However, dry mouth and sedation have been reported. Also, effects such as skin flushing, tachycardia, acute angle-closure glaucoma, nausea, palpitations and headache have been observed. Inhaled ipratropium does not decrease [[mucociliary clearance]].<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" /> The inhalation itself can cause headache and irritation of the throat in a few percent of patients.<ref name="AustriaCodex" />

Urinary retention has been reported in patients receiving doses by nebulizer. As a result, caution may be warranted, especially by  men with prostatic hypertrophy.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Afonso | first1 = A. S. M. | last2 = Verhamme | first2 = K. M.

==Interactions==
Interactions with other anticholinergics like [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s, [[antiparkinson]] drugs and [[quinidine]], which theoretically increase side effects, are clinically irrelevant when ipratropium is administered as an inhalant.<ref name="AustriaCodex" /><ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" />

==Pharmacology==
Chemically, ipratropium bromide is a quaternary ammonium compound obtained by treating [[atropine]] with [[2-bromopropane|isopropyl bromide]], thus the name: '''i'''so'''pr'''opyl + '''atrop'''ine.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

Ipratropium exhibits broncholytic action by reducing cholinergic influence on the bronchial musculature. It blocks muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, without specificity for subtypes, and therefore promotes the degradation of [[cyclic guanosine monophosphate]] (cGMP), resulting in a decreased intracellular concentration of cGMP.<ref name="Drugs.com">[http://www.drugs.com/pro/ipratropium.html Ipratropium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519210114/http://www.drugs.com/pro/ipratropium.html |date=2012-05-19 }} ''Drugs.com''</ref> Most likely due to actions of cGMP on intracellular calcium, this results in decreased contractility of smooth muscle in the lung, inhibiting [[bronchoconstriction]] and [[mucus]] [[secretion]]. It is a nonselective [[muscarinic]] [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]],<ref name="AustriaCodex" /> and does not diffuse into the blood, which prevents systemic side effects.  Ipratropium is a derivative of [[atropine]]<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yamatake Y, Sasagawa S, Yanaura S, Okamiya Y |title=[Antiallergic asthma effect of ipratropium bromide (Sch 1000) in dogs (author's transl)] |language=Japanese |journal=Nippon Yakurigaku Zasshi |volume=73 |issue=7 |pages=785–91 |year=1977 |pmid=145994 |doi=10.1254/fpj.73.785}}</ref> but is a [[quaternary amine]] and therefore does not cross the [[blood–brain barrier]], which prevents central side effects (anticholinergic syndrome). Ipratropium is not considered a short-acting bronchodilator and should never be used in place of [[salbutamol]] (albuterol) as a rescue medication.
