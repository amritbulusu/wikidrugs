'''Chlorphenamine''' (also known as '''chlorpheniramine''', '''CP''', or '''CPM''') is a [[first-generation antihistamine|first-generation]] [[antihistamine]] used in the prevention of the [[symptom]]s of [[allergy|allergic]] conditions such as [[rhinitis]] and [[urticaria]]. Its sedative effects are relatively weak compared to other first-generation antihistamines. Chlorphenamine is one of the most commonly used antihistamines in [[veterinary medicine|small-animal veterinary practice]]. Although not generally approved as an [[antidepressant]] or [[anxiolytic|anti-anxiety]] medication, chlorphenamine appears to have these properties as well.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Carlsson, Arvid |author2=Lindqvist, Margit |title=Central and peripheral monoaminergic membrane-pump blockade by some addictive analgesics and antihistamines|url=http://chemport.cas.org/cgi-bin/sdcgi?APP=ftslink&action=reflink&origin=wiley&version=1.0&coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADyaF1MXksVyis7o%3D&md5=e1e71cf2cfef04ed57f6f38ba2dd00c2|work=Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology|publisher=Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology|accessdate=1 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Gruetter CA, Lemke SM, Anestis DK, Szarek JL, Valentovic MA |title=Potentiation of 5-hydroxytryptamine-induced contraction in rat aorta by chlorpheniramine, citalopram and fluoxetine|publisher=Department of Pharmacology, Marshall University School of Medicine, Huntington, WV|pmid=1358631|volume=217|date=Jul 1992|journal=Eur J Pharmacol|pages=109–18|doi=10.1016/0014-2999(92)90827-q}}</ref>

==Medical uses==

===Combination products===
Chlorphenamine is often combined with [[phenylpropanolamine]] to form an [[allergy]] medication with both [[antihistamine]] and [[decongestant]] properties, though phenylpropanolamine is no longer available in the US after studies showed it increased the risk of stroke in young women. Chlorphenamine remains available with no such risk. Brand names had included Demazin, Allerest 12 Hour, [[Codral]] Nighttime, Chlornade, Contac 12 Hour, Exchange Select Allergy Multi-Symptom, A. R. M. Allergy Relief, Ordrine, Ornade Spansules, Teldrin, Triaminic, and [[Tylenol (brand)|Tylenol]] Cold/Allergy.

Chlorphenamine is combined with a narcotic ([[hydrocodone]]) in the product [[Tussionex]], which is indicated for treatment of cough and upper respiratory symptoms associated with allergy or cold in adults and children 6 years of age and older.<ref>{{cite web | title = Tussionex® Pennkinetic® (hydrocodone polistirex and chlorpheniramine polistirex) Extended-Release Suspension | year = 2011 | publisher = UCB | url = http://www.ucb.com/_up/ucb_com_products/documents/Tussionex%20Current%20COL%20Rev.%203E%2012.2011.pdf | format = PDF }}</ref>  This combination is manufactured as a time-released formula, which allows for administration every 12 hours, versus the more common 4-to-6-hour regimen for other narcotic cough suppressants.

Chlorphenamine/[[dihydrocodeine]] immediate-release syrups are also marketed. The antihistamine is helpful in cases where allergy or common cold is the reason for the cough; it is also a potentiator of opioids, allowing enhanced suppression of cough, analgesia, and other effects from a given quantity of the drug by itself. In various places in the world, cough & cold preparations containing codeine and chlorphenamine are available.

In the drug [[Coricidin]], chlorphenamine is combined with the cough suppressant [[dextromethorphan]].

==Side effects==
The adverse effects include drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, constipation, anxiety, nausea, blurred vision, restlessness, decreased coordination, dry mouth, shallow breathing, hallucinations, irritability, problems with memory or concentration, tinnitus and trouble urinating.

A large study linked the development of [[Alzheimer's disease]] and other forms of dementia to the use of chlorphenamine and other first-generation antihistamines, due to their [[anticholinergic]] properties.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gray|first=Shelly L.|last2=Anderson|first2=Melissa L.|last3=Dublin|first3=Sascha|last4=Hanlon|first4=Joseph T.|last5=Hubbard|first5=Rebecca|last6=Walker|first6=Rod|last7=Yu|first7=Onchee|last8=Crane|first8=Paul K.|last9=Larson|first9=Eric B.|date=January 26, 2015|title=Cumulative Use of Strong Anticholinergics and Incident Dementia: A Prospective Cohort Study|url=http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2091745|journal=JAMA Intern.

Chlorphenamine acts primarily as a potent [[antihistamine]]. It is specifically a potent [[inverse agonist]] of the [[histamine]] [[H1 receptor|H<sub>1</sub> receptor]]. The drug is also commonly described as possessing weak [[anticholinergic]] activity by acting as an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of the [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor]]s. The [[dextrorotatory]] [[stereoisomer]], [[dexchlorpheniramine]], has been reported to possess K<sub>d</sub> values of 15&nbsp;nM for the H<sub>1</sub> receptor and 1,300&nbsp;nM for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in human brain tissue.<ref name="pmid6086881">{{cite journal | vauthors = Richelson E, Nelson A | title = Antagonism by antidepressants of neurotransmitter receptors of normal human brain in vitro | journal = J.

In addition to being a [[histamine H1 receptor|histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptor]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]], chlorphenamine has been found to act as a potent [[serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (K<sub>d</sub> = 15.2&nbsp;nM for the [[serotonin transporter]]).<ref name="pmid9537821"/><ref name="pmid4390069">{{cite journal | vauthors = Carlsson A, Lindqvist M | title = Central and peripheral monoaminergic membrane-pump blockade by some addictive analgesics and antihistamines | journal = J.

==Chemistry==
Chlorphenamine is an [[aliphatic amine|alkylamine]] and is a part of a series of antihistamines including [[pheniramine]] (Naphcon) and its [[halogen]]ated derivatives including [[fluorpheniramine]], [[dexchlorphenamine]] (Polaramine), [[brompheniramine]] (Dimetapp), [[dexbrompheniramine]] (Drixoral), [[deschlorpheniramine]], and [[iodopheniramine]]. The halogenated alkylamine antihistamines all exhibit [[optical isomerism]], and chlorphenamine in the indicated products is racemic chlorphenamine maleate, whereas dexchlorphenamine is the [[dextrorotary]] stereoisomer.

===Synthesis===
There are several patented methods for the [[organic synthesis|synthesis]] of chlorphenamine. In one example, [[4-chlorophenylacetonitrile]] is reacted with [[2-chloropyridine]] in the presence of [[sodium amide]] to form 4-chlorophenyl(2-pyridyl)acetonitrile. Alkylating this with 2-dimethylaminoethylchloride in the presence of [[sodium amide]] gives γ-(4-chlorphenyl)-γ-cyano-''N'',''N''-dimethyl-2-pyridinepropanamine, the [[hydrolysis]] and [[decarboxylation]] of which lead to chlorphenamine.

[[File:Chlorpheniramine synthesis.png|center|thumb|600px|Chlorpheniramine synthesis 1: D. Papa, E. Schwenk, N. Sperber, {{US Patent|2567245}} (1951).]]

A second method starts from [[pyridine]], which undergoes alkylation by 4-chlorophenylacetonitrile,<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja01181a508 | title=Brominations with Pyridine Hydrobromide Perbromide | journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society | date=1948 | volume=70 | issue=1 | pages=417–418 | first=Carl | last=Djerassi}}</ref>  giving 2-(4-chlorobenzyl)pyridine. Alkylating this with 2-dimethylaminoethylchloride in the presence of sodium amide gives chlorphenamine.
