'''Sultiame''', also known as '''sulthiame''', is a [[sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]] and [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] of the [[enzyme]] [[carbonic anhydrase inhibitor|carbonic anhydrase]]. It is used as an [[anticonvulsant]].

==History==
Sultiame was first synthesised in the laboratories of [[Bayer]] AG in the mid 1950s and eventually launched as '''Ospolot''' in [[Europe]] and other markets the early 1960s. It never became a registered drug in the United States. The brand was transferred to [[Desitin Arzneimittel GmbH|Desitin GmbH]] in 1993 and is sold in several European countries, in Israel, Japan, and Australia.

Sultiame became established as a second-line drug for treatment of [[Focal seizures|partial]] epilepsy in the 1960s and 1970s and was often used in combination with the established anticonvulsant [[phenytoin]]. [[temporal lobe epilepsy|Temporal lobe seizures]] appeared particularly responsive to sultiame. Doubts subsequently arose as to whether sultiame has [[intrinsic]] anticonvulsant properties. After discovering sultiame's ability to raise the blood levels of phenytoin,<ref>Hansen JM, Kristensen M, Skovsted L. ''Sulthiame (Ospolot) as inhibitor of diphenylhydantoin metabolism''. Epilepsia 1968;9:17-22. {{PMID|4386877}}</ref> it was assumed that sultiame would only act in combination with phenytoin. This finding, together with the [[equivocal]] results of a study in the US,<ref>Green JR et al. ''Sulthiame: Evaluation as an anticonvulsant''. Epilepsia 1974;15:329-49. {{PMID|4386877}}</ref> resulted in a quick decline of sultiame's use. It was only in 1988, that the [[Germany|German]] child neurologist [[Hermann Doose]] discovered its specific effects in [[benign focal epilepsies of childhood]].<ref>Doose H et al. ''Benign partial epilepsy - treatment with sulthiame''. Dev Med Child Neurol 1988;30:683-4. {{PMID|2906619}}</ref> Today,  sulthiame is the drug of choice for benign focal epilepsies of childhood (such as [[benign rolandic epilepsy]]) in the [[German language|German]]-speaking countries and Israel.<ref>Wohlrab G. [http://www.epi.ch/_files/Epileptologie_(PDF)/E1_2003.pdf ''Epilepsiebehandlung im Kindes- und Jugendalter: Kontinuität und Wandel''.] Epileptologie 2003;20:25-30.</ref> There is renewed interest in sultiame's other potential uses, e.g., in [[West syndrome]]<ref>Debus OM et al. ''Sulthiame in the primary therapy of West syndrome''. Epilepsia 2004;45:103-8. {{PMID|14738417}}</ref><ref>Milburn-McNulty P, Powell G, Sills GJ, Marson AG. Sulthiame add-on therapy for epilepsy. Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2015; 10: CD009472</ref> and other [[refractory]] epilepsies<ref>Koepp MJ et al. ''Sulthiame in adults with refractory epilepsy and learning disability: an open trial''. Epilepsy Res 2002;50:277-82. {{PMID|12200218}}</ref>

==Indications==
Historically, sultiame has been used to treat [[Focal seizures|partial]] seizures. In Australia, it is currently registered for behavioural disorders associated with [[epilepsy]]; [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|hyperkinetic]] behaviour; temporal lobe epilepsy; [[Myoclonus|myoclonic]] [[seizure]]s; [[grand mal]] attacks; and [[Jacksonian seizure]]s.<ref>[http://www.pharmalab.com.au/resources/5/Ospolot%20PI%20TAB002%20TAB003%20Version0804.pdf Pharmalab Pty Ltd. ''Product Information Ospolot (Sulthiame)''.]</ref> In contrast to other sulfonamide drugs, sultiame is devoid of [[antibacterial]] activity.

==Adverse effects==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
The more common adverse effects are [[ataxia]], [[paraesthesia]] of face and limbs, [[hyperpnoea]], [[dyspnoea]], and [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexia]]. Less common adverse effects include giddiness, rash, [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]], [[nausea]], weight loss, [[leukopenia]], headache, psychic changes, depression, drooling, increased pain, frequency of fits, [[insomnia]], [[status epilepticus]]. Disturbances in [[calcium]] and [[vitamin D]] [[metabolism]] have been occasionally reported after long-term use.

==Interactions==
Sultiame taken together with [[primidone]] may lead to severe side-effects, including psychotic reactions. The addition of sulthiame to phenytoin therapy has shown to be followed by a rise in the serum levels of phenytoin. Sultiame may also lead to a rise of [[phenobarbitone]] blood levels. [[Alcohol]] must not be consumed during treatment.

==Overdose==
[[Vomiting]], [[hypotension]], headache, [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], [[ataxia]], metabolic [[acidosis]] with [[hyperpnoea]] and [[catatonic]] state may occur. There is no specific [[antidote]]. It is not known whether [[dialysis]] may help in case of overdose.

==Synthesis==
[[File:Sultiame synthesis.png|thumb|center|700px|Sultiame synthesis: B. Helferich and R. Behnisch, {{US Patent|2,916,489}}  (1959).]]

p-Aminobenzenesulfonamide can be alkylated by ω-chlorobutylsulfonyl chloride in base via presumed intermediate, which spontaneously cyclizes to give sulthiame.
