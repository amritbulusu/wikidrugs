'''Famciclovir''' is a [[guanosine]] analogue [[antiviral drug]] used for the treatment of various [[herpesvirus]] infections, most commonly for [[herpes zoster]] (shingles). It is a [[prodrug]] form of [[penciclovir]] with improved oral [[bioavailability]]. Famciclovir is marketed under the trade name '''Famvir''' ([[Novartis]]).

Famciclovir was approved for medical use in 1994.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Long|first1=Sarah S.|last2=Pickering|first2=Larry K.|last3=Prober|first3=Charles G.|title=Principles and Practice of Pediatric Infectious Disease|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=1437727026|page=1502|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=nQ7-o8JAH7kC&pg=PA1502|language=en}}</ref> On August 24, 2007, the [[United States]] [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved the first generic version of famciclovir.

It is also indicated for treatment of recurrent episodes of herpes simplex in HIV patients.

==Adverse effects==
Side effects: mild to extreme stomach upset, headaches, mild fever.

==Herpes==

=== Early treatment ===
Several studies in humans and mice provide evidence that early treatment with famciclovir soon after the first infection with herpes can significantly lower the chance of future outbreaks. Use of famciclovir in this manner has been shown to reduce the amount of latent virus in the neural ganglia compared to no treatment or treatment with [[valaciclovir]].<ref>The effects of antiviral therapy on the distribution of herpes simplex virus type 1 to ganglionic neurons and its consequences during, immediately following and several months after treatment"[http://vir.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/81/10/2385]"</ref><ref>Famciclovir and Valaciclovir Differ in the Prevention of Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 Latency in Mice: a Quantitative Study"[http://aac.asm.org/cgi/content/full/42/7/1555]"</ref><ref>Persistence of Infectious Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 in the Nervous System in Mice after Antiviral Chemotherapy"[http://aac.asm.org/cgi/content/full/44/1/97]"</ref> A review of human subjects treated for five days with famciclovir 250&nbsp;mg three times daily during their first herpes episode found that only 4.2 percent experienced a recurrence within six months after the first outbreak, a fivefold decrease compared to the 19 percent recurrence in acyclovir-treated patients.<ref>Observation May Indicate A Possible Clinical Effect On Latency"[https://web.archive.org/web/20120216215210/http://www.pslgroup.com/dg/D29E.htm]"</ref> Neither drug affected latency if treatment was delayed for several months.<ref name=Thackray>{{cite journal
