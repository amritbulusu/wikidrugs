'''Zucapsaicin''' ('''Civanex''') is a [[medication]] used to treat [[osteoarthritis]] of the knee and other [[neuropathic pain]]. It is applied three times daily for a maximum of three months. It reduces pain, and improves articular functions.  It is the [[Cisâ€“trans isomerism|''cis''-isomer]] of [[capsaicin]]. '''Civamide''', manufactured by Winston Pharmaceuticals, is produced in formulations for oral, nasal, and topical use (patch and cream).<ref>Winston Pharmaceuticals website {{cite web|url=http://www.winstonlabs.com/productdevelopment/civamide.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425230507/http://www.winstonlabs.com/productdevelopment/civamide.asp |archivedate=April 25, 2012 }}</ref>

Zucapsaicin has been tested for treatment of a variety of conditions associated with ongoing nerve pain. This includes [[herpes simplex]] infections; [[cluster headache]]s and [[migraine]]; and knee [[osteoarthritis]].<ref>Zucapsaicin information from the National Library of Medicine http://druginfo.nlm.nih.gov/drugportal</ref>
