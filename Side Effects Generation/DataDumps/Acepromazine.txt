'''Acepromazine''', '''acetopromazine''' or '''acetylpromazine''' (more commonly known as '''ACP''', '''Ace''', or by the trade names '''Atravet''' or '''Acezine 2''', number depending on mg/ml dose) is a [[phenothiazine]] derivative [[antipsychotic]] drug. It was tested in humans in the 1950s as an [[antipsychotic]],<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Collard JF, Maggs R |title=Clinical Trial of Acepromazine Maleate in Chronic Schizophrenia |journal=British Medical Journal |volume=1 |issue=5085 |pages=1452–4 |date=June 1958 |pmid=13536530 |pmc=2029326 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.1.5085.1452|url=}}</ref> but is now almost exclusively used on [[veterinary medicine|animals]] as a [[sedative]] and [[antiemetic]]. Its closely related analogue, [[chlorpromazine]], is still used as an antipsychotic in humans. Acepromazine is used primarily as a chemical restraint in hyperactive or fractious animals. However, it does not relieve anxiety, and some believe it may make anxiety worse in the long run if used on an anxious animal (for example, thunderstorm phobias).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Väisänen |first1=M. |last2=Raekallio |first2=M. |last3=Kuusela |first3=E. |last4=Huttunen |first4=P. |last5=Leppäluoto |first5=J. |last6=Kirves |first6=P. |last7=Vainio |first7=O. |title=Evaluation of the perioperative stress response in dogs administered medetomidine or acepromazine as part of the preanesthetic medication. |journal=American Journal of Veterinary Research |volume=63 |issue=7 |pages=969–75 |year=2002 |pmid=12118677 |doi=10.2460/ajvr.2002.63.969}}</ref><!--

==Pharmacology==
The clinical pharmacology of acepromazine is similar to that of other phenothiazine derived anti-psychotic agents. The primary behavioral effects are attributed to its potent antagonism of post-synaptic [[D2 receptor|D<sub>2</sub> receptor]]s and, to a lesser degree, the other [[D2-like receptor|D<sub>2</sub>-like receptor]]s. Additional effects are related to its appreciable antagonistic effects on various other receptors, including the [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub> receptors]], [[histamine H1 receptor|H<sub>1</sub> receptors]], and [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor|mACh receptor]]s. It is metabolized by the liver, oxidized to produce its primary metabolite, hydroxyethylpromazine sulfoxide, which is then excreted in the urine.<ref name=choudhary>{{Cite web | last=Choudhary | first=Gargi | title=Determination of Acepromazine and its Major Metabolite in Equine Serum by LC-MS/MS using the Finnigan LCQ Deca XP Plus Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer | url=http://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/brochures/App-Note-318-Determination-of-Acepromazine-and-its-Major-Metabolite-in-Equine-Serum.pdf | publisher=Thermo Electron Corporation}}</ref><ref name=smallvet>{{cite book | editor-first=Jill E. |editor-last=Maddison |editor2-first=Stephen W. | editor2-last=Page |editor3-first=David | editor3-last=Church | title=Small Animal Clinical Pharmacology | location=Edinburgh; New York | date=2008 | edition=2 | publisher=Saunders/Elsevier | isbn=9780702028588 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RpsROVqemk8C&lpg=PA115}}</ref>{{rp|115}} Its action at the [[chemoreceptor trigger zone]] (in the [[area postrema]]) and the [[solitary nucleus]] (in the [[medulla oblongata]]) allow it to have an antiemetic effect.<ref name=valverde>{{cite journal | last1=Valverde | first1=A | last2=Cantwell | first2=S | last3=Hernández | first3=J | last4=Brotherson | first4=C | title=Effects of acepromazine on the incidence of vomiting associated with opioid administration in dogs | journal=Veterinary Anaesthesia and Analgesia | date=April 2003 | doi=10.1046/j.1467-2995.2003.01331.x | issn=1467-2987 | volume=30 | issue=2 | pages=99 | url=http://www.vaajournal.org/article/S1467-2987(16)30962-X/fulltext}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Kolahian|first=Saeed|title=Efficacy of Different Antiemetics with Different Mechanism of Action on Xylazine Induced Emesis in Cats| journal=Iranian Journal of Veterinary Surgery | year=2014 | volume=9 | number=1 | url=http://www.ivsajournals.com/article_5789_6e9336886fafc7a62f1c710ade9bc1ef.pdf | page=10}}</ref>

==Veterinary use==

===Canine and feline===
The most common uses of acepromazine in animals are as an oral sedative before stressful events (such as thunderstorms), an injectable tranquilizer for particularly aggressive or fractious animal, and when combined with [[opiates]], a [[premedication]] or a post-operative pain reliever. Its effects as a [[CNS depressant]] means that less opiates are required to reach the same amount of sedation, and it prevents the [[arrhythmia]] and vomiting that many opiates induce. Its use as an oral sedative is somewhat controversial; acepromazine can increase sensitivity to noise and cause exaggerated startle reflexes. The [[dysphoric]] effect of phenothiazines and this increase in sensitivity can make some aggressive dogs and fractious cats more so.<ref name=drugs.com>{{Cite web | title=Acepromazine Maleate Injection for Animal Use | work=Drugs.com | accessdate=2017-06-11 | url=https://www.drugs.com/vet/acepromazine-maleate-injection.html}}</ref><ref name=1800petmeds>{{Cite web | title=Acepromazine: Pet Anxiety Medication for Dogs & Cats | work=1800PetMeds | accessdate=2017-06-11 | url=https://www.1800petmeds.com/Acepromazine-prod10209.html}}</ref><ref name=khuly>{{Cite web | last=Khuly | first=Patty | title=Acepromazine: Why I'm not a big fan when it comes to sedation via 'ace' | work=PetMD | accessdate=2017-06-12 | date=2009-10-22 | url=http://www.petmd.com/blogs/fullyvetted/2009/october/acepromazine-why-im-not-big-fan-when-it-comes-sedation-ace-6937}}</ref><ref name=smallvet />{{rp|116,130}}

====Adverse effects in cats====
While acepromazine is also used in cats, its absorption is erratic and can differ wildly from one cat to the next. It also generally induces less sedation than in dogs.<ref name=marroum /><ref>{{cite book | last1=Wingfield | first1=Wayne | last2=Raffe | first2=Marc | title=The Veterinary ICU Book | date=2002-09-29 | publisher=Teton NewMedia | isbn=9781893441132|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-DN35GUKOBgC&pg=PA81}}</ref> It also causes spontaneous motor activity (in both cats and dogs, but more often in cats) by blocking dopamine receptors in the [[striatum]] and [[substantia nigra]].<ref name="Riviere 2009" />

====Adverse effects in dogs====
Literature from the 1950s raised concerns about phenothiazine-induced seizures in human patients. For this reason, caution has typically been advised when contemplating acepromazine use in epileptic canine patients, as it was widely believed to lower the seizures threshold. More current studies, however, have failed to show a positive association between use of acepromazine and seizure activity<ref name=brooks>{{Cite web | last=Brooks | first=Wendy | title=Acepromazine (PromAce) | work=The Pet Pharmacy | accessdate=2017-06-11 | url=http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content.plx?P=A&C=31&A=570&S=0}}</ref><ref name=smallvet />{{rp|116}} and show a possible role for acepromazine in seizure control: in a retrospective study at University of Tennessee, acepromazine was administered for tranquilization to 36 dogs with a prior history of seizures and to decrease seizure activity in 11 dogs. No seizures were seen within 16 hours of acepromazine administration in the 36 dogs that received the drug, and the seizures abated for 1.5 to 8 hours (n=6) or did not recur (n=2) in eight of 10 dogs that were actively seizing. Excitement-induced seizures were reduced for 2 months in one dog.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tobias KM, Marioni-Henry K, Wagner R |title=A retrospective study on the use of acepromazine maleate in dogs with seizures |journal=Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=283–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16822767 |doi= 10.5326/0420283|url=http://www.jaaha.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16822767}}</ref> A second retrospective study also concluded that administration of acepromazine to dogs with prior or acute seizure history did not potentiate seizures, and there was some trend toward seizure reduction.<ref>{{cite journal |authors=McConnell J, Kirby R, Rudloff E |title=A retrospective study on the use of acepromazine maleate in dogs with seizures |journal=Journal of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care|volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=262–7 |year=2007|doi=10.1111/j.1476-4431.2007.00231.x |pmid=16822767}}</ref> It should be noted that the original seizure cautions reported in the 1950s were in human patients on relatively high doses of the antipsychotic chlorpromazine while the doses of acepromazine used in the two published veterinary studies cited above are much lower.

In some boxers, acepromazine can cause [[vasovagal syncope]] (due to a decreased stimulation of the [[sympathetic nervous system]]) and [[hypotension]] (due to [[vasodilation]]), leading to collapse.<ref name="Ettinger 2010">{{cite book|editor1-last=Ettinger|editor1-first=SJ|editor2-last=Feldman|editor2-first=EC|title=Textbook of veterinary internal medicine: Diseases of the dog and the cat|date=2010|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=978-1-4160-6593-7|edition=7th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Qzau1jagOYC&pg=PA1394-IA32&dq=acepromazine%20cats&pg=PA1394-IA32}}</ref> This may occur only in certain families of boxers, but the unknown risk to a individual dog means that acepromazine should be used at reduced doses, or not at all, in this breed.<ref name="Riviere 2009">{{cite book|editor1-last=Riviere|editor1-first=JE|editor2-last=Papich|editor2-first=MG|title=Veterinary pharmacology and therapeutics.|date=2009|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Ames, Iowa|isbn=978-0-8138-2061-3|pages=340, 561|edition=9th}}</ref> Individual dogs of any breed can have a profound reaction characterized by hypotension, especially if there is an underlying heart problem.

In [[Giant dog breed|giant-breed dog]]s and [[sighthound]]s, the sedative effects of acepromazine may last for 12–24 hours, which is much longer than the usual 3–4 hours.<ref name=brooks /><ref name="Ettinger 2010"/>

====Dogs with a mutation in the ''ABCB1'' (''MDR1'') gene====
[[P-glycoprotein]] (P-gp), also known as multidrug resistant protein 1 (MDR1), is a protein found in cell membranes which is important in the metabolism and excretion of some drugs,<ref name=smallvet />{{rp|41–58}} such as acepromazine and [[ivermectin]].<ref name="Mealey 2013"/> This protein is encoded by the ''[[ABCB1]]'' gene (previously known as the ''MDR1'' gene). A mutation in ''ABCB1'' prevents P-gp from being correctly produced, so that dogs with this mutation have an increased sensitivity to drugs (such as acepromazine) which are substrates of P-gp.<ref name="Mealey 2013"/> Dogs which are [[heterozygous]] (that is, which have one functioning ''ABCB1'' gene, and one non-functioning gene) are less sensitive to acepromazine than dogs which are [[homozygous]] (that is, which have two copies of the mutant gene). 75% of [[Collie]]s carry the mutated ''ABCB1'' gene, as do 50% of [[Australian Shepherd]]s. Other affected breeds include: Border Collie, English Shepherd, German Shepherd, Old English Sheepdog, and Sighthounds, shelties, long haired greyhound.<ref name="Mealey 2013">{{cite journal|last1=Mealey|first1=KL|title=Adverse drug reactions in veterinary patients associated with drug transporters|journal=The Veterinary Clinics Of North America: Small Animal Practice|date=September 2013|volume=43|issue=5|pages=1067–78|doi=10.1016/j.cvsm.2013.04.004|pmid=23890239|url=http://www.vetsmall.theclinics.com/article/S0195-5616(13)00109-5/fulltext}}</ref>

Tests for this mutation are available.<ref>{{Cite web | title=Multidrug Sensitivity in Dogs | url=http://vcpl.vetmed.wsu.edu/|publisher=Washington State University}}</ref>

===Equine===
In [[equine]] [[surgery]], premedication with acepromazine has been shown to reduce the perianaesthetic mortality rate, possibly due to its actions as a [[sedative]] and [[anxiolytic]].<ref name="Dugdale 2016">{{cite journal|last1=Dugdale|first1=AH|last2=Taylor|first2=PM|title=Equine anaesthesia-associated mortality: where are we now?|journal=Veterinary anaesthesia and analgesia|date=May 2016|volume=43|issue=3|pages=242–55|doi=10.1111/vaa.12372|pmid=26970940|url=http://www.vaajournal.org/article/S1467-2987(16)30068-X/fulltext}}</ref> It is less effective as a sedative if the horse is already excited.<ref name=thayer>{{Cite web | last=Thayer | first=Asia | title=HA Special Care Drug Chart | accessdate=2017-06-19 | date=2009 | url=https://www.ponyclub.org/ContentDocs/Instruction/CertHA/HA%20Drug%20Chart.pdf}}</ref>

Additionally, acepromazine is used as a [[vasodilator]] in the treatment of [[laminitis]], where an oral dose equivalent to "mild sedation" is commonly used, although the dose used is highly dependent on the treating veterinarian. While it is shown to elicit vasodilation in the distal limb, evidence showing its efficacy at increasing perfusion in the laminae is lacking. It is also sometimes used to treat a horse experiencing [[equine exertional rhabdomyolysis]].<ref name=forney />

In the UK, acepromazine is not authorized for use in horses intended for human consumption.<ref>{{Cite book | last=National Office of Animal Health | title=NOAH Compendium of Data Sheets for Animal Medicines 2005:38 | location=Enfield | date=2004 | publisher=National Office of Animal Health | isbn=9780954803704}}</ref>

====Adverse effects====
Side effects are not common, but the use of acepromazine in [[stallions]] should be used with caution (but is not absolutely [[contraindicated]]) due to the risk of [[paraphimosis]] and [[priapism]].<ref name=plumb>{{cite book |last=Plumb |first=Donald C. |date=2011 |title=Plumb's Veterinary Drug Handbook, 7th ed. |url=http://www.plumbsonline.com |location=Ames, Iowa |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |pages=4–5 |isbn=978-0-4709-5965-7}}</ref>

Acepromazine also lowers blood pressure, and should therefore be used with caution in horses that are experiencing [[anemia]], [[dehydration]], [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], or [[horse colic|colic]]. It should not be used in horses dewormed with [[piperazine]].<ref name=thayer />
