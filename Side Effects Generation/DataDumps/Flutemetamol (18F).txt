'''Flutemetamol (<sup>18</sup>F)''' (trade name '''Vizamyl''', by [[GE Healthcare]]) is a [[PET scan]]ning [[radiopharmaceutical]] containing the radionuclide [[fluorine-18]], used as a diagnostic tool for [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref name="Spreitzer">{{cite journal

==Adverse effects==
Adverse effects of flutemetamol include headache, [[nausea]], dizziness, flushing and increased blood pressure.<ref>{{cite web|title=FDA Press Release|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm372261.htm|website=FDA|accessdate=November 17, 2016}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
After the substance is given [[intravenous]]ly, it accumulates in [[beta amyloid]] plaques in the patient's brain, which thus become visible via positron emission tomography (PET).<ref name="Spreitzer" />

== Manufacturing and distribution ==
Flutemetamol (<sup>18</sup>F) can be produced within five to six hours. It then undergoes a quality check and is ready to be distributed immediately after. The product must be used within a certain time frame for maximum efficacy. Because of the limited time window, flutemetamol is not produced until an order has been placed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gevizamyl.com/us/about/manufacturing-and-distribution/|title=Manufacturing and Distribution  {{!}}  Vizamyl (Flutemetamol F 18 Injection)|website=www.gevizamyl.com|access-date=2016-11-21}}</ref> 

Flutemetamol is typically administered [[intravenous]]ly in 1 to 10&nbsp;mL doses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www3.gehealthcare.co.uk/en-gb/products/categories/nuclear_imaging_agents/vizamyl#tabs/tab3E9C0BE2F0854E419605207DDF87001C|title=Life Sciences Content Alert|website=www3.gehealthcare.co.uk|access-date=2016-11-21}}</ref> Average costs for PET scans without insurance coverage are around $3,000. Currently [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] does not cover use of amyloid imaging agents except for in clinical trials.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.alz.org/documents_custom/hcp_faq_auc.pdf|title=Alzheimer's Association|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=November 20, 2016}}</ref> Because of this, there is a low market for flutemetamol. 

==History==
Flutemetamol was first approved for use in the US by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 2013 for intravenous use.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|title=GE Vizamyl|url=http://www.gevizamyl.com/us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Vizamyl-43-1067B-04_25_16_PI-3.pdf|website=gevizamyl|accessdate=November 20, 2016}}</ref>

=== Clinical trials ===
Two clinical trials were conducted for flutemetamol (<sup>18</sup>F). The first compared PET scans of terminally ill patients with flutemetamol to [[post mortem]] standard-of-truth assessments of cerebral cortical [[neuritic plaque]] density. The second trial assessed intra-reader reproducibility of PET scans using flutemetamol.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gevizamyl.com/us/about/efficacy-and-safety/|title=Efficacy and Safety  {{!}}  Vizamyl (Flutemetamol F 18 Injection)|website=www.gevizamyl.com|access-date=2016-11-20}}</ref>

==== Clinical trial 1 ====
Of the 176 patients imaged in this trail had a median age was 82, with 57 of patients being female. The initial flutemetamol PET scan resulted in 43 positive and 25 negative results for cerebral cortisol amyloid status. 69 of the initial patients died within 13 months of the flutemetamol PET scan. The autopsy for 67 of those patients determined the global brain neuritic plaque density category. Of those 67 patients 41 were positive and 26 were negative.<ref name=":0" /> These results correlate with the pre-mortem scan.

==== Clinical trial 2 ====
The second clinical trail included 276 subjects with a median age of 72. The trial measured the effectiveness of an electronic training program for flutemetamol image interpretation using PET scans from trial 1 among other subjects with a variety of cognitive impairment. Final results met the pre-specified success rate with a [[Fleiss' kappa statistic]] of 0.83.<ref name=":0" />

== Society and culture ==
=== Economics ===
GE Healthcare's largest marketing aspect for flutemetamol is that it is the only FDA approved amyloid imaging agent for color image interpretation. <ref name=":1" />
