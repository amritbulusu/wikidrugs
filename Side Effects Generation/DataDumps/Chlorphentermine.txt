'''Chlorphentermine''' (trade names '''Apsedon''', '''Desopimon''', '''Lucofen''') is a [[serotonergic]] [[anorectic|appetite suppressant]] of the [[substituted amphetamine|amphetamine]] family. Developed in 1962, it is the 4-chloro derivative of the better known appetite suppressant [[phentermine]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gylys | first1 = JA | last2 = Hart | first2 = JJ | last3 = Warren | first3 = MR | date = Sep 1962 | title = Chlorphentermine, a new anorectic agent | url = | journal = Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 137 | issue = | pages = 365–73 }}</ref> which is still in current use.

Chlorphentermine acts as a highly selective [[serotonin releasing agent]] (SRA).<ref name="pmid11071707">{{cite journal |vauthors=Rothman RB, Baumann MH, Dersch CM, Romero DV, Rice KC, Carroll FI, etal | title=Amphetamine-type central nervous system stimulants release norepinephrine more potently than they release dopamine and serotonin. | journal=Synapse | year= 2001 | volume= 39 | issue= 1 | pages= 32–41 | pmid=11071707 | doi=10.1002/1098-2396(20010101)39:1<32::AID-SYN5>3.0.CO;2-3 }}</ref> It is not a [[psychostimulant]] and has little or no [[abuse potential]], but is classed as a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule III controlled substances|Schedule III]] drug in the USA due mainly to its similarity to other appetite suppressants such as [[diethylpropion]] which have been more widely abused. It is no longer used due mainly to safety concerns, as it has a serotonergic effects profile similar to other withdrawn appetite suppressants such as [[fenfluramine]] and [[aminorex]] which were found to cause [[pulmonary hypertension]] and [[cardiac fibrosis]] following prolonged use.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rothman | first1 = RB | last2 = Ayestas | first2 = MA | last3 = Dersch | first3 = CM | last4 = Baumann | first4 = MH | date = Aug 1999 | title = Aminorex, fenfluramine, and chlorphentermine are serotonin transporter substrates.
