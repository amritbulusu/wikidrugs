'''Indapamide''' is a [[thiazide-like diuretic]]<ref>{{MeshName|Indapamide}}</ref> [[medication|drug]] marketed by [[Servier]], generally used in the treatment of [[hypertension]], as well as decompensated [[heart failure]]. Combination preparations with [[perindopril]] (an [[ACE inhibitor]] antihypertensive) are also available.

== Form and composition ==
Indapamide is available generically as 1.25 mg and 2.5 mg non-scored tablets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://online.lexi.com/crlsql/servlet/crlonline|title=Lexicomp Online Login|work=lexi.com}}</ref> It is now also available in SR (sustained release) form.

== Indications ==
Hypertension and edema due to congestive heart failure.  Indapamide has been proven in the HYVET trial to reduce stroke and all cause mortality when given with or without [[perindopril]] to people over the age of 80 for the treatment of hypertension.<ref>{{cite journal|title=HYVET Trial| pmid=18378519 | doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0801369 | volume=358| date=May 2008| journal=N. Engl. J. Med.| pages=1887–98 | last1 = Beckett | first1 = NS | last2 = Peters | first2 = R | last3 = Fletcher | first3 = AE | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al}}</ref>

== Dosage and administration ==
The adult dosage is 1.25 to 5 mg, orally and once daily, usually in the morning.

== Contraindications ==
Indapamide is contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to [[sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]]s, severe [[kidney failure]], [[hepatic encephalopathy]] or severe [[liver failure]], and a [[hypokalemia|low blood potassium level]].

There is insufficient safety data to recommend indapamide use in [[pregnancy]] or [[breastfeeding]].

== Interactions ==
Caution is advised in the combination of indapamide with [[lithium]] and nonantiarrhythmic drugs causing wave-burst arrhythmia (astemizole, bepridil, IV erythromycin, halofantrine, pentamidine, sultopride, terfenadine, vincamine).

== Precautions ==
Monitoring of potassium and uric acid serum levels is recommended, especially in subjects with a predisposition or a sensitivity to hypokalemia and in patients with gout.

== Adverse effects ==
Commonly reported [[adverse event]]s are hypokalemia (low potassium levels), [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[orthostatic hypotension]] (blood pressure decrease on standing up) and allergic manifestations.

== Overdosage ==
Symptoms of overdosage would be those associated with a diuretic effect, i.e. electrolyte disturbances, hypotension, and muscular weakness. Treatment should be symptomatic, directed at correcting electrolyte abnormalities.

* [[Perindopril/indapamide]] — a [[Combination drug|fixed-dose combination]] used for [[essential hypertension]]
