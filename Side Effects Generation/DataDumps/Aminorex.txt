'''Aminorex''' ('''Menocil''', '''Apiquel''', '''aminoxaphen''', '''aminoxafen''', '''McN-742''') is a weight loss ([[anorectic]]) [[stimulant]] [[drug]]. It was withdrawn from the market after it was found to cause [[pulmonary hypertension]].<ref name="pmid11083709">{{cite journal |vauthors =Gaine SP, Rubin LJ, Kmetzo JJ, Palevsky HI, Traill TA |title=Recreational use of aminorex and pulmonary hypertension |journal=Chest |volume=118 |issue=5 |pages=1496–7 |date=November 2000 |pmid=11083709 |doi= 10.1378/chest.118.5.1496|url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11083709}}</ref> In the U.S., it is an illegal [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule I controlled substances|Schedule I]] drug, with no medical use and poor safety profile.

Aminorex, in the 2-[[amine|amino]]-5-[[aryl]] [[oxazoline]] class, was developed by McNeil in 1962.<ref>US Patent 3161650 - 2-Amino-5-Aryloxazoline Products</ref> It is closely related to [[4-methylaminorex]]. Aminorex has been shown to have locomotor stimulant effects, lying midway between [[dextroamphetamine]] and [[methamphetamine]].  Aminorex effects have been attributed to the release of [[catecholamines]].<ref name="pmid9884392">{{cite journal |author =Fishman AP. |title=Aminorex to fen/phen - An epidemic foretold |journal=Circulation |issue=1 |pages=156–161 |date=Jan 1991 |pmid=9884392 |issn=0009-7322 |volume=99 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.99.1.156}}</ref> 

==History==
It was discovered in 1962 by [[Edward John Hurlburt]],<ref>{{US patent|3115494}}</ref> and was quickly found in 1963 to have an [[anorectic]] effect in [[rat]]s. It was introduced as a [[Prescription drug|prescription]] appetite suppressant in [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]] in 1965, but was withdrawn in 1972 after it was found to cause [[pulmonary hypertension]] in approximately 0.2% of patients, and was linked to a number of deaths.<ref name="pmid9884392"/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Weigle|first1=DS|title=Pharmacological therapy of obesity: past, present, and future.|journal=The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism|date=June 2003|volume=88|issue=6|pages=2462–9|pmid=12788841|doi=10.1210/jc.2003-030151}}</ref>

==Synthesis==
The synthesis was first reported in a [[structure-activity relationship]] study of 2-amino-5-aryl-2-oxazolines, where aminorex was found to be approximately 2.5 times more potent than ''D''-amphetamine sulfate in inducing anorexia in rats, and was also reported to have CNS stimulant effects.

The [[racemic]] synthesis involves addition/cyclization reaction of 2-amino-1-phenylethanol with [[cyanogen bromide]].<ref name="pmid14185981">{{cite journal |vauthors =Poos GI, Carson JR, Rosenau JD, Roszowski AP, Kelley NM, McGowin J  |title=2-Amino-5-aryl-2-oxazolines.
