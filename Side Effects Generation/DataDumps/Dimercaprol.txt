[[Arsenic]] and some other heavy metals act by chemically reacting with adjacent [[thiol]] residues on metabolic enzymes, creating a [[chelate]] complex that inhibits the affected enzyme's activity.<ref>Goldman M, Dacre JC. (1989) Lewisite: its chemistry, toxicology, and biological effects. Rev Environ Contam Toxicol 110: 75-115
</ref> Dimercaprol competes with the thiol groups for binding the metal ion, which is then excreted in the urine.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Dimercaprol is itself toxic, with a narrow [[therapeutic index|therapeutic range]] and a tendency to concentrate arsenic in some organs. Other drawbacks include the need to administer it by painful [[intramuscular injection]].<ref>Mückter H, Liebl B, Reichl FX et al. (1997) Are we ready to replace dimercaprol (BAL) as an arsenic antidote? Human and Experimental Toxicology 16: 460-465
</ref> Serious side effects include [[nephrotoxicity]] and [[hypertension]].

Dimercaprol has been found to form stable chelates ''in vivo'' with many other metals including inorganic [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[antimony]], [[bismuth]], [[cadmium]], [[chromium]], [[cobalt]], [[gold]], and [[nickel]].  However, it is not necessarily the treatment of choice for toxicity to these metals.  Dimercaprol has been used as an adjunct in the treatment of the acute encephalopathy of lead toxicity. It is a potentially toxic drug, and its use may be accompanied by multiple side effects.  Although treatment with dimercaprol will increase the excretion of cadmium, there is a concomitant increase in renal cadmium concentration, so that its use in case of cadmium toxicity is to be avoided.  It does, however, remove inorganic mercury from the kidneys; but is not useful in the treatment of alkylmercury or phenyl mercury toxicity. Dimercaprol also enhances the toxicity of [[selenium]] and [[tellurium]], so it is not to be used to remove these elements from the body.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}
