==History==
===Squibb===
The Squibb corporation was founded in 1858 by [[Edward Robinson Squibb]] in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], New York.  Squibb was known as a vigorous advocate of quality control and high purity standards within the fledgling pharmaceutical industry of his time, at one point self-publishing an alternative to the U.S. Pharmacopeia (''Squibb's Ephemeris of Materia Medica'') after failing to convince the [[American Medical Association]] to incorporate higher purity standards. Mentions of the ''Materia Medica'', Squibb products, and Edward Squibb's opinion on the utility and best method of preparation for various medicants are found in many medical papers of the late 1800s.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Inverse Type of Temperature in Typhoid Fever, with a Report of Two Cases — Temperature Peculiarities in Epidemics, with a Report of Seven Cases in One Family |journal=Boston Medical and Surgical Journal (Later, NEJM) |date=January 8, 1885 |last=Hollopeter |first=W.C. |volume=112 |pages=28–32 |doi=10.1056/NEJM188308301090903 |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM188710271171706 |accessdate=2014-11-25 |quote="The writer noticed (in December, 1882) the important fact that when common or Japan camphor and crystallized carbolic acid are mixed together and subjected to heat, a colorless liquid would be the result.

Squibb, " Ephemeris of Materia Medica", etc., on page 673, vol. ii., No. 5, where a brief allusion appears under the appellation of Compound Alum Powder. Dr. F. R.

===Bristol-Myers===
In 1887, [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] graduates [[William McLaren Bristol]] and [[John Ripley Myers]] purchased the Clinton Pharmaceutical company of [[Clinton, Oneida County, New York|Clinton]], New York. In 1898, they decided to rename it '''Bristol, Myers and Company'''. Following Myers' death in 1899, Bristol changed the name to the '''Bristol-Myers Corporation'''. The first nationally recognized product was [[Sal Hepatica]], a [[laxative]] mineral salt in 1903. Its second national success was [[Ipana]] toothpaste, from 1901 through the 1960s.<ref name="MarketingChannels">Bert Rosenbloom, ''Marketing Channels'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=6WMJAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA609 Bristol-Myers Squibb], 2011, page 609</ref>

In 1943, Bristol-Myers acquired Cheplin Biological Laboratories, a producer of [[acidophilus|acidophilus milk]] in [[East Syracuse, New York]], and converted the plant to produce [[penicillin]] for the [[Allies of World War II|World War II Allied forces]]. After the war, the company renamed the plant [[Bristol Laboratories]] in 1945 and entered the civilian [[antibiotics]] market, where it faced competition from Squibb, which had opened the world's largest penicillin plant in 1944 in New Brunswick, New Jersey.<ref name="MarketingChannels"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Bristol-Myers Squibb|url=https://www.drugwatch.com/manufacturer/bristol-myers-squibb/|website=Drugwatch|accessdate=November 14, 2016|date=February 25, 2016}}</ref> Penicillin production at the East Syracuse plant was ended in 2005, when it became less expensive to produce overseas,{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} but the facility continues to be used for the manufacturing process development and production of other [[biopharmaceutical|biologic medicines]] for clinical trials and commercial use.<ref>[http://www.bms.com/sustainability/worldwide_facilities/north_america/Pages/syracuse_new_york.aspx Bristol-Meyers Squibb, ''Syracuse, New York'']</ref>

===Merger===
Bristol-Myers and Squibb merged in 1989, with Bristol-Myers as the nominal survivor. The merged company became Bristol-Myers Squibb.

In 1999, President Clinton awarded Bristol-Myers Squibb the [[National Medal of Technology]], the nation's highest recognition for technological achievement, "for extending and enhancing human life through innovative pharmaceutical research and development and for redefining the science of clinical study through groundbreaking and hugely complex clinical trials that are recognized models in the industry."

===2000 to 2010===
In 2002, the company was involved in a lawsuit of maintaining illegally a monopoly on Taxol, its cancer treatment, and it was again sued for the antitrust lawsuit 5 years later, which cost the company $125 million for settlement.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2002/06/04/news/companies/bristol |title= Bristol hit with antitrust suit |date=June 4, 2002 |accessdate=Jul 10, 2013 |work=CNN}}</ref> 

The company was involved in an [[accounting scandal]] in 2002 that resulted in a significant restatement of revenues from 1999 to 2001. The restatement was the result of an improper booking of sales related to "[[channel stuffing]]" as the practice of offering excess inventory to customers to create higher sales numbers. The company has since settled with the [[United States Department of Justice]] and [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], agreeing to pay $150 million while neither admitting nor denying guilt.<ref>{{cite press release

On October 24, 2002, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. restated earnings downward for parts of 2000 and 2001 while revising this year's earnings upward because of its massive inventory backlog imbroglio that spurred two government investigations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-68980061.html |title= Bristol-Myers to restate earnings as third quarter profits plunge}}</ref> On March 15, 2004, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. adjusted upward its fourth-quarter and full-year 2003 results after reversing an earlier decision about how to deal with accounting errors made in prior years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-92165333.html |title= Bristol-Myers restates results upward due to accounting errors}}</ref> As part of a Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the company was placed under the oversight of a monitor appointed by the U.S. Attorney in New Jersey. In addition, the former head of the Pharma group, Richard Lane, and the ex-CFO, Fred Schiff, were indicted for federal securities violations. 

An investigation of the company was made public in July 2006, and the [[FBI]] raided the company's corporate offices. The investigation centered on the distribution of Plavix and charges of [[collusion]].<ref>[http://www.busrep.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=565&fArticleId=3367635 Business Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817193955/http://www.busrep.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=565&fArticleId=3367635 |date=17 August 2007 }}, July 31, 2006. Retrieved September 7, 2006. Archived at</ref> On September 12, 2006, the monitor, former Federal Judge [[Frederick B. Lacey]], urged the company to remove then CEO Peter Dolan over the Plavix dispute. Later that day, BMS announced that Dolan would indeed step down.<ref>[http://money.cnn.com/2006/09/12/news/companies/bristol/index.htm?postversion=2006091217 CNN.com], September 12, 2006. Retrieved September 12, 2006</ref> 

The Deferred Prosecution Agreement expired in June 2007 and the Department of Justice did not take any further legal action against the company for matters covered by the DPA. Under CEO Jim Cornelius, who was CEO following Dolan until May 2010, all executives involved in the "channel-stuffing" and generic competition scandals have since left the company. 

In 2009, a major restructuring involves focusing on the pharmaceutical business and biologic products, along with productivity initiatives and cost-cutting and streamlining business operations through a multi-year program of on-going layoffs.  As another cost-cutting measure Bristol-Myers also reduced subsidies for health-care to retirees and plans to freeze their pension plan at the end of 2009.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} In August, BMS acquired the [[biotechnology]] firm [[Medarex]] as part of the company's "String of Pearls" strategy of alliances, partnerships and acquisitions.<ref>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/BristolMyers-Squibb-to-bw-571310065.html?x=0&.v=1</ref> In November, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced that it was "splitting off" Mead Johnson Nutrition by offering BMY shareholders the opportunity to exchange their stock for shares in Mead Johnson. According to Bristol-Myers Squibb, this move was expected to further sharpen the company's focus on biopharmaceuticals. 

BMS is a Fortune 500 Company (#114 in 2010 list). Newsweek's 2009 Green Ranking recognized Bristol-Myers Squibb as 8th among 500 of the largest United States corporations. Also, BMS was included in the 2009 Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index of leading sustainability-driven companies. 

In October 2010, the company acquired ZymoGenetics, securing an existing product as well as pipeline assets in hepatitis C, cancer and other therapeutic areas.  [[Lamberto Andreotti]] was named [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] this year; he had previously served as "president and [[Chief operating officer|COO]] responsible for all pharmaceutical operations worldwide."<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|title = BMS CEO Andreotti to Retire; COO named as Successor|last = Staff|date = 15 February 2015|work = [[Gen.
