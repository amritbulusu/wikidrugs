'''Granisetron''' is a [[serotonin]] [[5-HT3 antagonist|5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist]] used as an [[antiemetic]] to treat [[nausea]] and vomiting following [[chemotherapy]]. Its main effect is to reduce the activity of the [[vagus nerve]], which is a nerve that activates the vomiting center in the [[medulla oblongata]].  It does not have much effect on vomiting due to motion sickness.  This drug does not have any effect on [[dopamine]] receptors or [[muscarinic receptor]]s.

Granisetron was developed by chemists working at the British drug company [[Beecham (pharmaceutical company)|Beecham]] around 1988 and is available as a generic. It is produced by [[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche Laboratories]] under the trade name Kytril. The drug was approved in the United Kingdom in 1991 and in United States in 1994 by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]].

A granisetron [[transdermal patch]] with the trade name Sancuso was approved by the US FDA on September 12, 2008.<ref>PRNewswire. [http://www.drugs.com/newdrugs/fda-approves-sancuso-first-only-patch-preventing-nausea-vomiting-cancer-patients-undergoing-1119.html FDA Approves Sancuso, the First and Only Patch for Preventing Nausea and Vomiting in Cancer Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy]. September 12, 2008.</ref> Sancuso is manufactured by 3M Drug Delivery Systems Division in St. Paul, MN, for ProStrakan, Inc., a pharmaceutical company headquartered in Bedminster, NJ, with global headquarters in Scotland.

Granisetron is metabolized slowly by the liver, giving it a longer than average [[Biological half-life|half-life]]. One dose usually lasts 4 to 9 hours and is usually administered once or twice daily.  This drug is removed from the body by the [[liver]] and [[kidney]]s.

==Medical uses==

===Chemotherapy===
It may be used for [[chemotherapy]]-induced nausea and vomiting and appears to work about the same as [[ondansetron]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Billio|first=A|author2=Morello, E |author3=Clarke, MJ |title=Serotonin receptor antagonists for highly emetogenic chemotherapy in adults.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=January 20, 2010|issue=1|pages=CD006272|pmid=20091591|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006272.pub2}}</ref> The most common side-effects of chemotherapy treatment are nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. This is one type of drug that a doctor can prescribe to prevent, lessen, or relieve discomfort.

===Post operative===
A number of medications including granisetron appear to be effective in controlling [[post-operative nausea and vomiting]] (PONV).<ref name=Carl2006/> It is unclear if it is more or less effective than other agents such as [[droperidol]], [[metoclopramide]], [[ondansetron]] or [[cyclizine]].<ref name=Carl2006>{{cite journal|last=Carlisle|first=JB|author2=Stevenson, CA|title=Drugs for preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=July 19, 2006|issue=3|pages=CD004125|pmid=16856030|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004125.pub2}}</ref>

Its efficacy has also been questioned with a research Dr. [[Yoshitaka Fujii]] having 12 published papers on this topic in Canadian Journal of Anesthesia retracted. A further five papers in the same journal on the same drug by Dr Fujii are considered indeterminate.

===Other===
* Is a possible therapy for nausea and vomiting due to acute or chronic medical illness or acute [[gastroenteritis]]
* Treatment of [[cyclic vomiting syndrome]] although there are no formal trials to confirm efficacy.

==Adverse effects==
Granisetron is a well-tolerated drug with few side effects. Headache, dizziness, and constipation are the most commonly reported side effects associated with its use.  There have been no significant drug interactions reported with this drug's use.  It is broken down by the [[liver]]'s [[cytochrome P450]] system and it has little effect on the metabolism of other drugs broken down by this system.

==Extended release==

An extended release injectable version of granisetron, known as Sustol is also available in the United States as of 2016.<ref>Drugs.com [https://www.drugs.com/newdrugs/heron-therapeutics-announces-fda-approval-sustol-granisetron-extended-release-prevention-4420.html Heron Therapeutics Announces FDA Approval of Sustol (granisetron) Extended-Release Injection for the Prevention of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting]</ref> The long acting form is used for the treatment of both acute and delayed CINV in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and anthrocycline and/or cyclophosphamide (AC) highly emetogenic regimens. In its review, the FDA did not grant the broad HEC label to the drug citing the focus on AC regimens, primarily breast-cancer, and lack of data.<ref>FDA.gov [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2016/022445s000lbl.pdf Sustol Prescribing Information].</ref>
