'''Desoxymethyltestosterone''' (nicknames '''Madol''', '''Pheraplex''') is a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]], [[oral administration|orally active]] [[anabolic-androgenic steroid]] (AAS) and a [[17α-alkylated anabolic steroid|17α-methylated]] [[chemical derivative|derivative]] of [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT). It was one of the first [[designer steroid]]s to be marketed as a [[performance-enhancing drug]] to [[athlete]]s and [[bodybuilder]]s.

Desoxymethyltestosterone is sometimes abbreviated as '''DMT''', though it should not be confused with the [[hallucinogen]] [[dimethyltryptamine]], which is also known by the same acronym.

==Side effects==
{{See also|Anabolic steroid#Adverse effects}}

==Pharmacology==
In animal studies, desoxymethyltestosterone has been found to bind to the [[androgen receptor]] (AR) about as half as strongly as DHT, and caused [[side effect]]s that are typical of 17α-alkylated AAS, such as [[hepatotoxicity|liver damage]] when taken in higher dosages as well as [[left ventricular hypertrophy]].<ref name="pmid17254722">{{cite journal | vauthors = Diel P, Friedel A, Geyer H, Kamber M, Laudenbach-Leschowsky U, Schänzer W, Thevis M, Vollmer G, Zierau O | title = Characterisation of the pharmacological profile of desoxymethyltestosterone (Madol), a steroid misused for doping | journal = Toxicol.

Desoxymethyltestosterone is unusual in that it is structurally a 2-[[-ene|ene]] compound, lacking the 3-[[ketone|keto]] group present in almost all commercial AAS (with [[ethylestrenol]] being a notable and one of the few exceptions). This does not mean it is a weak compound, and clinical research has determined that it is a fairly potent oral agent.<ref name="pmid17254722" /> Rat studies indicate that desoxymethyltestosterone has an anabolic effect 160% that of testosterone while being only 60% as androgenic, giving it a Q ratio of 6.5:1.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Edwards J.A. |author2=Bowers A. | journal = Chemistry and Industry | year = 1961 | pages = 1962–63}}</ref> Because of this favorable ratio, experiments in [[orchiectomy|orchiectomized]] rats have demonstrated that treatment with desoxymethyltestosterone resulted only in a stimulation of the weight of the levator ani muscle; the [[prostate gland|prostate]] and [[seminal vesicle]] weights remained unaffected leading the authors of one study to characterize desoxymethyltestosterone as a powerful AAS with attributes of a [[selective androgen receptor modulator]] (SARM) and some indication of [[toxicity]].<ref name="pmid17254722" />

Desoxymethyltestosterone, also known as '''3-desoxy-17α-methyl-δ<sup>2</sup>-5α-dihydrotestosterone''' ('''3-desoxy-17α-methyl-δ<sup>2</sup>-DHT''') or as '''17α-methyl-5α-androst-2-en-17β-ol''', is a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]] [[androstane]] [[steroid]] and a [[17α-alkylated AAS|17α-alkylated]] [[chemical derivative|derivative]] of [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT).

==History==
Desoxymethyltestosterone was invented in 1961 by Max Huffman who obtained a patent on the compound the same year.<ref name="pmid17254722" /> It was described in the scientific literature in 1963.<ref name="pmid17254722" /> However, it was never brought to market as a commercial drug.<ref>{{US patent|2996524}}</ref><ref name="pmid17254722" /> Desoxymethyltestosterone was rediscovered by chemist, AAS enthusiast, and amateur bodybuilder [[Patrick Arnold]] in 2005. Arnold produced desoxymethyltestosterone and supplied it to Victor Conte of [[Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative]] (BALCO), an American nutritional supplement company and steroid supplier.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/can/press/2006/2006_08_04_arnold_sentencing%20press.htm |title=Chemist Who Created "The Clear" Sentenced |publisher=United States Attorney for the Northern District of California |date=2006-08-04 |accessdate=2007-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014084938/http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/can/press/2006/2006_08_04_arnold_sentencing%20press.htm |archivedate=2006-10-14 |df= }}</ref>
