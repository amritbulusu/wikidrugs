==Structure==
[[X-ray crystallography]] studies have shown solithromycin, the first fluoroketolide in clinical development, has a third region of interactions with the bacterial ribosome,<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1128/AAC.00860-10 |vauthors=Llano-Sotelo B, Dunkle J, Klepacki D, Zhang W, Fernandes P, Cate JH, Mankin AS | title =  Binding and Action of CEM-101, a New Fluoroketolide Antibiotic That Inhibits Protein Synthesis| journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy| year = 2010 | volume = 54 | issue = 12 | pages = 4961–4970| pmid = 20855725 | pmc=2981243}}</ref> as compared with two binding sites for other [[ketolide]]s.

The only (previously) marketed [[ketolide]], [[telithromycin]], suffers from rare but serious [[side effect]]s.  Recent studies<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1128/AAC.00840-10|vauthors=Bertrand D, Bertrand S, Neveu E, Fernandes P | title =  Molecular characterization of off-target activities of telithromycin: a potential role for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors| journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy| year = 2010 | volume = 54 | issue = 12 | pages = 599–5402| pmid = 20855733 | pmc=2981250}}</ref> have shown this to be likely due to the presence of the [[pyridine]]-[[imidazole]] group of the telithromycin side chain acting as an antagonist towards various [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s.
