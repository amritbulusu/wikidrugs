==Medical uses==
Acamprosate is useful when used along with counselling in the treatment of [[alcoholism|alcohol dependence]].<ref name=Plo2015/> Over three to twelve months it increases the number of people who do not drink at all and the number of days without alcohol.<ref name=Plo2015/> It appears to work as well as [[naltrexone]].<ref name=Plo2015/>

==Contraindications==
Acamprosate is primarily removed by the kidneys and should not be given to people with severely impaired kidneys ([[Renal function#Creatinine Clearance CCr|creatinine clearance]] less than 30ml/min). A dose reduction is suggested in those with moderately impaired kidneys ([[Renal function#Creatinine Clearance CCr|creatinine clearance]] between 30ml/min and 50ml/min).<ref name=ClinicalPK>{{cite journal|last1=Saivin|first1=S|last2=Hulot|first2=T|last3=Chabac|first3=S|last4=Potgieter|first4=A|last5=Durbin|first5=P|last6=Houin|first6=G|title=Clinical Pharmacokinetics of Acamprosate|journal=Clinical Pharmacokinetics|date=Nov 1998|volume=35|issue=5|pages=331–345|pmid=9839087|doi=10.2165/00003088-199835050-00001}}</ref><ref name=AcamprosatePI>{{cite web|title=Campral Prescribing Information|date=2004|url=http://www.frx.com/pi/campral_pi.pdf|publisher=Forest Pharmaceuticals|accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref> It is also contraindicated in those who have a strong allergic reaction to acamprosate calcium or any of its components.<ref name="ClinicalPK"/><ref name="AcamprosatePI"/>

==Pharmacology==
[[File:Acamprosate Calcium Structural Formulae.png|200px|thumb|acamprosate calcium]]
The [[mechanism of action]] of acamprosate is unknown and controversial.<ref name="ReillyLobo2008">{{cite journal|last1=Reilly|first1=Matthew T.|last2=Lobo|first2=Ingrid A.|last3=McCracken|first3=Lindsay M.|last4=Borghese|first4=Cecilia M.|last5=Gong|first5=Diane|last6=Horishita|first6=Takafumi|last7=Adron Harris|first7=R.|title=Effects of Acamprosate on Neuronal Receptors and Ion Channels Expressed inXenopusOocytes|journal=Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research|volume=32|issue=2|year=2008|pages=188–196|issn=0145-6008|doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.2007.00569.x}}</ref> At high concentrations, well above those that occur clinically (1–3 μM), reports of inhibition of [[glutamate receptor]]-activated responses (1 mM), enhancement of [[NMDA receptor]] function (300 μM), weak [[receptor antagonist|antagonization]] of the NMDA receptor, [[partial agonism]] of the [[polyamine]] site of the NMDA receptor, and possible inhibition of the [[mGluR1]] and [[mGluR5]] (10 μM) have all been published.<ref name="ReillyLobo2008" /> However, no direct action of acamprosate at clinically-relevant concentrations has yet been reported. Moreover, a subsequent study found no action of acamprosate on the mGluR1 or mGluR5 at concentrations as high as 100 μM, nor at [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub>]] or [[glycine receptor]]s or [[voltage-gated sodium channel]]s.<ref name="ReillyLobo2008" />

===GABA===
Ethanol and benzodiazepines act on the central nervous system by binding to the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, increasing the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA (i.e., it is a positive allosteric modulator). In chronic alcohol abuse, one of the main mechanisms of tolerance is attributed to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors becoming downregulated (i.e. becoming generally less sensitive to the inhibitory effect of the GABA system). When alcohol is no longer consumed, these down-regulated GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor complexes are so insensitive to GABA that the typical amount of GABA produced has little effect; compounded with the fact that GABA normally inhibits action potential formation, there are not as many receptors for GABA to bind to — meaning that excitatory neurotransmission is unopposed, leading to over-excitation. Acamprosate's mechanism of action is supposed to be, at least partially, due to an enhancement effect on GABA receptors. It has been purported to open the chloride ion channel in a novel way as it does not require GABA as a cofactor, making it less liable for dependence than benzodiazepines. Acamprosate has been successfully used to control [[tinnitus]], hyperacusis, ear pain and inner ear pressure during alcohol use due to spasms of the tensor tympani muscle. {{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===NMDA===
In addition, alcohol also inhibits the activity of [[NMDA receptor|''N''-methyl-<small>D</small>-aspartate receptors]] (NMDARs). Chronic alcohol consumption leads to the overproduction ([[upregulation]]) of these receptors. Thereafter, sudden alcohol abstinence causes the excessive numbers of NMDARs to be more active than normal and to contribute to the symptoms of [[delirium tremens]] and [[excitotoxicity|excitotoxic]] neuronal death.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tsai | first1 = G | last2 = Coyle | first2 = JT | title = The role of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the pathophysiology of alcoholism | journal = Annual Review of Medicine | volume = 49 | pages = 173–84 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9509257 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.med.49.1.173 }}</ref> [[Drug withdrawal|Withdrawal]] from alcohol induces a surge in release of excitatory [[neurotransmitter]]s like [[Glutamic acid|glutamate]], which activates NMDARs.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tsai | first1 = GE | last2 = Ragan | first2 = P | last3 = Chang | first3 = R | last4 = Chen | first4 = S | last5 = Linnoila | first5 = VM | last6 = Coyle | first6 = JT | title = Increased glutamatergic neurotransmission and oxidative stress after alcohol withdrawal | url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/155/6/726 | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 155 | issue = 6 | pages = 726–32 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9619143 }}</ref> Acamprosate reduces this glutamate surge.<ref name="De Witte 2005">{{cite journal | last1 = De Witte | first1 = P | last2 = Littleton | first2 = J | last3 = Parot | first3 = P | last4 = Koob | first4 = G | title = Neuroprotective and abstinence-promoting effects of acamprosate: elucidating the mechanism of action | journal = CNS Drugs | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 517–37 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15963001 | doi=10.2165/00023210-200519060-00004}}</ref> The drug also protects cultured cells from excitotoxicity induced by [[ethanol withdrawal]]<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer | first1 = S | last2 = Harris | first2 = BR | last3 = Gibson | first3 = DA | last4 = Blanchard | first4 = JA | last5 = Prendergast | first5 = MA | last6 = Holley | first6 = RC | last7 = Littleton | first7 = J | title = Acamprosate, MK-801, and ifenprodil inhibit neurotoxicity and calcium entry induced by ethanol withdrawal in organotypic slice cultures from neonatal rat hippocampus | journal = Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research | volume = 26 | issue = 10 | pages = 1468–78 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12394279 | doi = 10.1097/01.ALC.0000033261.14548.D2 }}</ref> and from glutamate exposure combined with ethanol withdrawal.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Al Qatari | first1 = M | last2 = Khan | first2 = S | last3 = Harris | first3 = B | last4 = Littleton | first4 = J | title = Acamprosate is neuroprotective against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity when enhanced by ethanol withdrawal in neocortical cultures of fetal rat brain | journal = Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research | volume = 25 | issue = 9 | pages = 1276–83 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11584146 | doi = 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2001.tb02348.x }}</ref>

===Calcium===
In contrast to the aforementioned wide array of purported mechanisms of action, a 2013 profile animal study published in ''[[Neuropsychopharmacology (journal)|Neuropsychopharmacology]]''<ref name=Spanagel2014>{{cite journal |vauthors=Spanagel R, Vengeliene V, Jandeleit B, Fischer WN, Grindstaff K, Zhang X, Gallop MA, Krstew EV, Lawrence AJ, Kiefer F |title=Acamprosate produces its anti-relapse effects via calcium. |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology. |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=783–791 |date=March 2014 |pmid=24081303 |doi=10.1038/npp.2013.264 |url=}}</ref> suggests that acamprosate has by itself no psychotropic profile, no [[NMDA receptor|''N''-methyl-<small>D</small>-aspartate receptor]] or [[metabotropic glutamate receptor 5]] activity, and that therapeutic effects are due to the active calcium moiety co-administered with the acamprosate salt form. These findings have not yet been reproduced.

===Neuroprotective effects===
In addition to its apparent ability to help patients refrain from drinking, some evidence suggests that acamprosate is [[neuroprotection|neuroprotective]] (that is, it protects [[neuron]]s from damage and death caused by the effects of alcohol withdrawal, and possibly other causes of [[neurotoxicity]]).<ref name="De Witte 2005"/><ref name=MannReview>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mann K, Kiefer F, Spanagel R, Littleton J |title=Acamprosate: recent findings and future research directions |journal=Alcohol.

===Names===

"Acamprosate" is the [[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]] and [[British Approved Name|BAN]] for this substance. "Acamprosate calcium" is the [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]] and [[Japanese Accepted Name|JAN]]. It is also technically known as ''N''-acetylhomotaurine or as calcium acetylhomotaurinate,

It is sold under the brand name Campral.

===Approval===
While the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in the [[United States]] approved this drug in July 2004, it has been legal in [[Europe]] since 1989. After it approved the drug, the FDA released this statement:<blockquote>While its mechanism of action is not fully understood, Campral is thought to act on the [[brain]] pathways related to alcohol abuse. Campral was demonstrated to be safe and effective by multiple [[placebo]]-controlled [[clinical trial|clinical studies]] involving alcohol-dependent patients who had already been withdrawn from alcohol, (i.e., [[Drug rehabilitation|detoxified]]). Campral proved superior to placebo in maintaining [[abstinence]] (keeping patients off alcohol consumption), as indicated by a greater percentage of acamprosate-treated subjects being assessed as continuously abstinent throughout treatment. Campral is not [[Substance dependence|addicting]] and was generally well tolerated in clinical trials. The most common [[adverse drug reaction|adverse events]] reported for patients taking Campral included [[headache]], [[diarrhea]], [[flatulence]], and [[nausea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/answers/2004/ANS01302.html |title=FDA Approves New Drug for Treatment of Alcoholism |accessdate=2009-08-15 |date=2004-07-29 |work=FDA Talk Paper |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117175319/http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/answers/2004/ANS01302.html |archivedate=2008-01-17}}</ref></blockquote>
