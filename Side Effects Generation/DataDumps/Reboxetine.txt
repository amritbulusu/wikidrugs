'''Reboxetine''', sold under the brand name '''Edronax''' among others, is a drug of the [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] (NRI) class, marketed as an [[antidepressant]] by [[Pfizer]] for use in the treatment of [[major depressive disorder|major depression]], although it has also been used [[off-label]] for [[panic disorder]] and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD).<ref name = MD>{{cite book|title=Reboxetine Mesilate|work=Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference|publisher=The Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain|date=8 November 2011|accessdate=10 November 2013|url=http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/martindale/current/20430-f.htm}}</ref> It is approved for use in many countries worldwide, but has not been approved for use in the [[United States]].

==Medical uses==

===Major depressive disorder===
There has been much debate as to whether reboxetine is more efficacious than placebo into the treatment of depression. According to a 2009 meta-analysis of 12 second-generation antidepressants, reboxetine was no more effective than placebo, and was "significantly less" effective, and less acceptable, than the other drugs in treating the acute-phase of adults with unipolar major depression.<ref name=Lancet2009>{{cite journal | date = February 2009 |author1=Cipriani, A |author2=Furukawa, TA |author3=Salanti, G |author4=Geddes, JR |author5=Higgins, JP |author6=Churchill, R |author7=Watanabe, N |author8=Nakagawa, A |author9=Omori, IM |author10=McGuire, H | author11=Tansella, M |author12=Barbui, C | title = Comparative efficacy and acceptability of 12 new-generation antidepressants: a multiple-treatments meta-analysis | journal = Lancet | volume = 373 | issue = 9665 | pages = 746–758 | pmid = 19185342 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60046-5 | url = http://www.cipralex.co.il/sitecontent/ExternalFiles/213.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = }}</ref>

The British [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency|MHRA]] said in September 2011 that the study had several limitations, and that "Overall the balance of benefits and risks for reboxetine remains positive in its authorised indication."<ref name = MHRA>{{cite web|title=Reboxetine: benefit-risk balance reviewed|date=September 2011|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Safetyinformation/DrugSafetyUpdate/CON128957|work=Drug Safety Update|publisher=Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency|accessdate=10 November 2013}}</ref> A UK and Europe-wide review of available efficacy and safety data has confirmed that reboxetine has benefit over placebo in its authorised indication. Efficacy was clearly shown in patients with severe or very severe depression.<ref name = MHRA/>

According to a systematic review and meta-analysis by [[Institut für Qualität und Wirtschaftlichkeit im Gesundheitswesen|IQWiG]], including unpublished data, published data on reboxetine overestimated the benefit of reboxetine versus placebo by up to 115% and reboxetine versus SSRIs by up to 23%, and also underestimated harm, concluding that reboxetine was an ineffective and potentially harmful antidepressant. The study also showed that nearly three quarters of the data on patients who took part in trials of reboxetine were not published by Pfizer until now.<ref name=BMJ/>

Reboxetine is a fairly selective [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] (NRI) with approximately 20-fold [[binding selectivity|selectivity]] for the [[norepinephrine transporter]] (NET) over the [[serotonin transporter]] (SERT).<ref name = PDSP>{{cite web | title = PDSP K<sub>i</sub> Database |work = Psychoactive Drug Screening Program (PDSP) |author1=Roth, BL |author2=Driscol, J | url = http://pdsp.med.unc.edu/pdsp.php | publisher = University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the United States National Institute of Mental Health | accessdate = 10 November 2013 |date = 12 January 2011}}</ref> Despite this selectivity reboxetine does slightly inhibit the reuptake of serotonin at therapeutic doses.<ref name="AMH">{{cite book | editor = Rossi, S | isbn = 978-0-9805790-9-3 | title = Australian Medicines Handbook | place = Adelaide | publisher = The Australian Medicines Handbook Unit Trust | year = 2013 | edition = 2013 }}</ref> It does not interact with or inhibit the [[dopamine transporter]] (DAT).<ref name = PDSP /><ref name="GG" />

Reboxetine has been found to inhibit both brain and cardiac [[G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channel|GIRKs]], a characteristic it shares with the NRI [[atomoxetine]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kobayashi|first=T|author2=Washiyama, K |author3=Ikeda, K |title=Inhibition of G-protein-activated inwardly rectifying K+ channels by the selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors atomoxetine and reboxetine.|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|date=Jun 2010|volume=35|issue=7|pages=1560–9|pmid=20393461|doi=10.1038/npp.2010.27|pmc=3055469}}</ref>

===Pharmacokinetics===
Both the (''R'',''R'')-(–) and (''S'',''S'')-(+)-enantiomers of reboxetine are predominantly metabolized by the [[CYP3A4]] [[isoenzyme]].<ref name="DMM1999-Wienkers">{{cite journal |vauthors=Wienkers LC, Allievi C, Hauer MJ, Wynalda MA | title=Cytochrome P-450-Mediated Metabolism of the Individual Enantiomers of the Antidepressant Agent Reboxetine in Human Liver Microsomes | journal=Drug Metabolism & Disposition | volume=27 | issue=11 | year=1999 | pages=1334–1340 | pmid=10534319}}</ref>
The primary metabolite of reboxetine is ''O''-desethylreboxetine, and there are also three minor metabolites&mdash;Phenol A, Phenol B, and UK1, Phenol B being the most minor.<ref name="DMM1999-Wienkers"/>

==Chemistry==
Reboxetine has two [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral centers]]. Thus, four stereoisomers may exist, the (''R'',''R'')-, (''S'',''S'')-, (''R'',''S'')-, and (''S'',''R'')-isomers. The active ingredient of reboxetine is a racemic mixture of two [[enantiomer]]s, the (''R'',''R'')-(–)- and (''S'',''S'')-(+)-isomer.<ref name="Tetrahedron1985-Melloni">{{cite journal |vauthors=Melloni P, Della Torre A, Lazzari E, Mazzini G, Meroni M | title=Configuration studies on 2-[alpha -(2-ethoxyphenoxy)benzyl]-morpholine FCE 20124|journal=Tetrahedron | volume=41 | issue=1 | year=1985 | pages=1393–1399 | doi=10.1016/S0040-4020(01)96541-X}}</ref>

In 2010, the German [[Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care]] (IQEHC) published results of a meta-analysis of clinical trial data for reboxetine in acute depression, which included data on about 3,000 subjects that Pfizer had never published but had mentioned; IQEHC had combed through Pfizer's publications and reboxetine approvals and had determined this data was missing from the publication record.  The analysis of the complete data set yielded a result that reboxetine was not more effective than placebo but had more side effects than placebo and more than [[fluoxetine]]; the paper led to widespread and sharp criticism of Pfizer, and stronger calls for publication of all clinical trial data.<ref name = BMJ/><ref name=Lowe2011/><ref>Staff, Genetic Engineering News.
