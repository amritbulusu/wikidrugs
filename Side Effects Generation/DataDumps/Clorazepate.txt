'''Clorazepate'''<ref>US Patent 3966793</ref> (marketed under the brand names '''Tranxene''' and '''Novo-Clopate'''), also known as '''clorazepate dipotassium''', is a [[benzodiazepine]]. It possesses [[anxiolytic]], [[anticonvulsant]], [[sedative]], [[hypnotic]], and [[skeletal muscle relaxant]] properties. Clorazepate is an unusually long-lasting benzodiazepine and serves as a majoritive [[prodrug]] for the equally long-lasting [[desmethyldiazepam]], which is rapidly produced as an [[active metabolite]]. Desmethyldiazepam is responsible for most of the therapeutic effects of clorazepate.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ochs HR, Greenblatt DJ, Verburg-Ochs B, Locniskar A |title=Comparative single-dose kinetics of oxazolam, prazepam, and clorazepate: three precursors of desmethyldiazepam |journal=J Clin Pharmacol |volume=24 |issue=10 |pages=446–51 |date=October 1984 |pmid=6150943 |doi= 10.1002/j.1552-4604.1984.tb01817.x|url=http://jcp.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/24/10/446}}</ref>

==Indications==
Clorazepate is used in the treatment of [[anxiety disorder]]s and [[insomnia]]. It may also be prescribed as an [[anticonvulsant]] or [[muscle relaxant]].<ref name="nlmclor"/> It is also used as a premedication.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=17551699 | doi=10.1007/s00101-007-1208-7 | volume=56 | issue=9 | title=[Comparison of premedication regimes. A randomized, controlled trial] |date=September 2007 | journal=Anaesthesist | pages=890–2, 894–6 |vauthors=Meybohm P, Hanss R, Bein B |display-authors=etal}}</ref>

Clorazepate is prescribed principally in the treatment of [[alcohol withdrawal]] and [[epilepsy]], although it is also a useful [[anxiolytic]] because of its long half-life. The normal starting dosage range of Clorazepate is 15 to 60&nbsp;mg per day. The drug is to be taken two to four times per day. Dosages as high as 90 to 120&nbsp;mg per day may be used in the treatment of acute alcohol withdrawal. In the United States and Canada, Clorazepate is available in 3.75, 7.5, and 15&nbsp;mg capsules or tablets. In Europe, tablet formations are 5&nbsp;mg, 10&nbsp;mg, 20&nbsp;mg and 50&nbsp;mg.<ref>[http://www.ziekenhuis.nl/index.php?cat=medicijngids&medgids=item&id=51600 Tranxene prescribing information in the Netherlands (Dutch language)]; accessed 2007-03-08.</ref> Clorazepate SD (controlled release) is available and may have a reduced incidence of adverse effects. The sustained-release formulation of clorazepate has some advantages in that, if a dose is missed, less profound fluctuations in blood plasma levels occur, which may be helpful to some people with epilepsy at risk of break-through seizures.<ref name="Riss-2008"/>

==Pharmacology==
Clorazepate is a "classical" benzodiazepine.  Other classical benzodiazepines include [[chlordiazepoxide]], [[diazepam]], [[clonazepam]], [[oxazepam]], [[lorazepam]], [[nitrazepam]], [[bromazepam]] and [[flurazepam]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Braestrup C |author2=Squires RF. | date=1 April 1978| title = Pharmacological characterization of benzodiazepine receptors in the brain | journal = Eur J Pharmacol | volume = 48 | issue = 3 | pages = 263–70 | pmid = 639854 | doi = 10.1016/0014-2999(78)90085-7 }}</ref> Clorazepate is a long-acting benzodiazepine drug.<ref>{{cite journal | author = The Committee on the Review of Medicines (CRM) | date  =  March 29, 1980 |  title = Systematic review of the benzodiazepines.

Committee on the Review of Medicines | journal = Br Med J. | volume = 280 | issue = 6218 | pages = 910–2 | pmid = 7388368 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.280.6218.910 | pmc = 1601049 }}</ref> Clorazepate produces the [[active metabolite]] [[desmethyl-diazepam]], which is a [[partial agonist]] of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor and has a half life of 20 – 179 hours; a small amount of desmethyldiazepam is further metabolised into [[oxazepam]]. Clorazepate exerts its pharmacological properties via increasing the opening frequency of the chloride ion channel of [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors]]. This effect of benzodiazepines requires the presence of the neurotransmitter GABA and results in enhanced inhibitory effects of the neurotransmitter GABA acting on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors.<ref name="Riss-2008"/> Clorazepate, like other benzodiazepines, is widely distributed and is highly bound to plasma proteins; clorazepate also crosses readily over the [[placenta]] and into breast milk. Peak plasma levels of the [[active metabolite]] desmethyl-diazepam are seen between 30 minutes and 2 hours after oral administration of clorazepate. Clorazepate is completely metabolised to desmethyl-diazepam in the gastrointestinal tract and thus the pharmacological properties of clorazepate are largely due to desmethyldiazepam.<ref name="Riss-2008"/>

==Interactions==
[[Image:Clorazepate DOJ.jpg|frame|right]]
All [[sedatives]] or [[hypnotics]] e.g. other [[benzodiazepines]], [[antiepileptic]] drugs, [[alcohol]], [[antihistamines]], [[opiates]], [[neuroleptics]], [[sleep aids]] are likely to magnify the effects of clorazepate on the [[central nervous system]]. Drugs that may interact with clorazepate include, [[digoxin]], [[disulfiram]], [[fluoxetine]], [[isoniazid]], [[ketoconazole]], [[levodopa]], [[metoprolol]], [[hormonal contraception|hormonal contraceptives]], [[probenecid]], [[propranolol]], [[rifampin]], [[theophylline]], [[valproic acid]].<ref name="nlmclor">{{cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a682052.html |title=Clorazepate |accessdate=19 July 2008 |author=National Institutes of Health |year=2003 |publisher=National Library of Medicine |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520212630/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a682052.html |archivedate=20 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]], [[cimetidine]], [[macrolide]] antibiotics and [[antimycotics]] inhibit the metabolism of benzodiazepines and may result in increased plasma levels with resultant enhancement of adverse effects. [[Phenytoin]], [[phenobarbital]], and [[carbamazepine]] have the opposite effect, with coadministration leading to increased metabolism and decreased therapeutic effects of clorazepate.<ref name="Riss-2008"/>

==Adverse effects==
Adverse effects of clorazepate include, [[drug tolerance|tolerance]], [[drug dependence|dependence]], [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] reactions, cognitive impairment, [[confusion]], [[anterograde amnesia]], falls in the elderly, [[ataxia]], hangover effects, and drowsiness. It is unclear whether cognitive deficits resulting from the [[long-term use of benzodiazepines]] return to normal or persist indefinitely after withdrawal from benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines are also known to cause or worsen [[Major depression|depression]]. [[Paradoxical effects]] including excitement and paradoxical worsening of seizures can sometimes result from the use of benzodiazepines. Children, the elderly, individuals with a history of [[alcohol abuse]] or a history of aggressive behavior and anger are at greater risk of developing paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines.<ref name="Riss-2008">{{Cite journal | last1 = Riss | first1 = J. | last2 = Cloyd | first2 = J. | last3 = Gates | first3 = J. | last4 = Collins | first4 = S. | title = Benzodiazepines in epilepsy: pharmacology and pharmacokinetics | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/120119477/PDFSTART | format = PDF | journal = Acta Neurol Scand | volume = 118 | issue = 2 | pages = 69–86 |date=Aug 2008 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0404.2008.01004.x | pmid = 18384456 }}</ref>

===Tolerance, dependence and withdrawal===
{{Main|Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome}}
[[Delirium]] has been noted from discontinuation from clorazepate<ref>{{cite journal|last=Allgulander|first=C,|author2=Borg S.|title=Case Report: A Delirious Abstinence Syndrome Associated with Clorazepate (Tranxilen)|journal=British Journal of Addiction|year=1978|volume=73|pages=175–177|pmid=27202|issue=2|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.1978.tb00139.x}}</ref> 
A [[benzodiazepine dependence]] occurs in approximately one third of patients who take benzodiazepines for longer than 4 weeks, which is characterised by a withdrawal syndrome upon dose reduction. When used for [[seizure]] control, tolerance may manifest itself with an increased rate of seizures as well an increased risk of withdrawal seizures. In humans, tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of clorazepate occurs frequently with regular use. Due to the development of tolerance, benzodiazepines are, in general, not considered appropriate for the long-term management of epilepsy; increasing the dose may result only in the developing of tolerance to the higher dose combined with worsened adverse effects. Cross-tolerance occurs between benzodiazepines, meaning that, if individuals are tolerant to one benzodiazepine, they will display a tolerance to equivalent doses of other benzodiazepines. Withdrawal symptoms from benzodiazepines include a worsening of pre-existing symptoms as well as the appearance of new symptoms that were not pre-existing. The withdrawal symptoms may range from mild anxiety and insomnia to severe withdrawal symptoms such as [[seizures]] and [[psychosis]]. Withdrawal symptoms can be difficult in some cases to differentiate between pre-existing symptoms and withdrawal symptoms. Use of high doses, long-term use and abrupt or over-rapid withdrawal increases increase the severity of withdrawal syndrome.<ref name="Riss-2008"/> However, tolerance to the [[active metabolite]] of clorazepate may occur more slowly than with other benzodiazepines.<ref name="Riss-2008"/> Regular use of benzodiazepines causes the development of dependence characterised by tolerance to the therapeutic effects of benzodiazepines and the development of the [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]] including symptoms such as [[anxiety]], [[apprehension (fear)|apprehension]], [[tremor]], [[insomnia]], [[nausea]], and [[vomiting]] upon cessation of benzodiazepine use. Withdrawal from benzodiazepines should be gradual as abrupt withdrawal from high doses of benzodiazepines may cause [[confusion]], [[toxic psychosis]], [[convulsions]], or a condition resembling [[delirium tremens]]. Abrupt withdrawal from lower doses may cause depression, [[Anxiety|nervousness]], [[rebound insomnia]], [[irritability]], [[sweating]], and [[diarrhea]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Committee on the Review of Medicines | date  =  March 29, 1980 |  title = Systematic review of the benzodiazepines.

==Contraindications and special caution==
Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, children, alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with [[comorbid]] [[psychiatric disorders]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Authier | first1 = N. | last2 = Balayssac | first2 = D. | last3 = Sautereau | first3 = M. | last4 = Zangarelli | first4 = A. | last5 = Courty | first5 = P. | last6 = Somogyi | first6 = AA. | last7 = Vennat | first7 = B. | last8 = Llorca | first8 = PM. | last9 = Eschalier | first9 = A. | title = Benzodiazepine dependence: focus on withdrawal syndrome | journal = Ann Pharm Fr | volume = 67 | issue = 6 | pages = 408–13 |date=November 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharma.2009.07.001 | pmid = 19900604  }}</ref>

Chlorazepate if used late in pregnancy, the [[third trimester]], causes a definite risk a severe [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]] in the neonate with symptoms including [[hypotonia]], and reluctance to suck, to [[apnoeic]] spells, [[cyanosis]], and impaired [[metabolic]] responses to cold stress. [[Floppy infant syndrome]] and sedation in the newborn may also occur. Symptoms of floppy infant syndrome and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome have been reported to persist from hours to months after birth.<ref>{{cite journal | author = McElhatton PR. |date=Nov 1994 | title = The effects of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy and lactation | journal = Reprod Toxicol. | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = 461–75 | pmid = 7881198 | doi = 10.1016/0890-6238(94)90029-9 }}</ref>

Special precaution is required when using clorazepate in the elderly because the elderly metabolise clorazepate more slowly, which may result in excessive drug accumulation. Additionally the elderly are more sensitive to the adverse effects of benzodiazepines compared to younger individuals even when blood plasma levels are the same. Use of benzodiazepines in the elderly is only recommended for 2 weeks and it is also recommended that half of the usual daily dose is prescribed.<ref name="Riss-2008"/>

==Legal status==
In the United States, clorazepate is listed under [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule IV drugs|Schedule IV]] of the [[Controlled Substances Act]].

==Chemistry==
Chorazepate is used in the form of a dipotassium [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]. 

Chorazepate can be synthesized starting from 2-amino-5-chlorobenzonitrile, which upon reaction with [[phenylmagnesium bromide]] is transformed into 2-amino-5-chlorbenzophenone [[imine]].<ref>J. Schmitt, {{US Patent|3516988}} (1970)</ref><ref>J. Schmitt, {{Cite patent|DE|1518764}} (1965)</ref><ref>J. Schmitt, P. Comoy, M. Subsequent, G. Callet, I. Le Meur, T. Clim, M. Brunaud, J. Mereir, J. Salle, G. Siou, Chim. Ther., 4, 239 (1969)</ref>  Reacting this with aminomalonic ester gives a heterocyclization product, 7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-3-carbethoxy-5-phenyl-2''H''-benzodiazepin-2-one.  Upon hydrolysis using an alcoholic solution of [[potassium hydroxide]] forms a dipotassium salt, chlorazepate.
