'''Clinafloxacin''' is an [[investigational new drug|investigational]] [[fluoroquinolone]] [[antibiotic]]. Despite its promising antibiotic activity, the clinical development of clinafloxacin has been hampered by its risk for inducing serious [[side effects]].

==Medical uses==
Clinafloxacin has not been approved for any indication. The [[investigational new drug]] application was withdrawn by the manufacturer in 1999, citing safety concerns.<ref name="Pharmaletter 1999">{{cite web|title=W-L withdraws clinafloxacin NDA|url=https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/w-l-withdraws-clinafloxacin-nda|website=thepharmaletter.com|publisher=The Pharma Letter|accessdate=14 September 2017}}</ref>

===Available forms===
Clinafloxacin is available in both oral and intravenous formulations.<ref name="Kucers 6ed" />

===Specific populations===
There is a warning against using clinafloxacin in pregnant patients, due to possible damage to the developing fetus.<ref name="PubChem" />

==Adverse effects==
The use of clinafloxacin is associated with [[phototoxicity|drug-induced light sensitivity]] (phototoxicity) and [[hypoglycaemia|low blood sugar]].<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Rubinstein | first1 = E. | title = History of quinolones and their side effects. | journal = Chemotherapy | volume = 47 Suppl 3 | issue =  | pages = 3–8; discussion 44–8 | month =  | year = 2001 | doi =  10.1159/000057838| pmid = 11549783 }}</ref> [[Diarrhea]] has also been reported.<ref name="Kucers 6ed" />

The phototoxicity with clinafloxacin has been more associated with oral dosing as compared to intravenous dosing, though the studies that described this were subject to [[confounding]] by study site (that is, patients that received intravenous clinafloxacin were less mobile, and thereby received less sunlight exposure).<ref name="Kucers 6ed" /> 

The mechanism for clinafloxacin's phototoxicity involves the [[chlorine]] atom at position 8. In the presence of [[ultraviolet light]], the chemical structure of clinafloxacin is degraded, resulting in the formation of toxic, [[reactive oxygen species]] that can damage cellular structures--including [[DNA]]. For this reason clinafloxacin can also be classified as a [[photocarcinogen]] (a chemical that can cause light-induced cancer), though the risk of developing cancer in humans taking the medication is small.<ref name="Kucers 6ed" />

The mechanism for clinafloxacin's effect on blood glucose is thought to involve stimulation of the pancreatic [[beta cells]], which produce [[insulin]] (a hormone that lowers blood glucose levels).<ref name="Kucers 6ed" />

The symptoms of clinafloxacin overdose are unknown.<ref name="Clina Overdose">{{cite web|title=In case of emergency/overdose|url=http://www.clinafloxacin.com/clinafloxacin_emergency.html|website=clinafloxacin.com|accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref>

==Interactions==
===Drug-drug interactions===
Clinafloxacin inhibits multiple [[CYP450]] drug metabolizing enzymes, especially [[CYP1A2]].<ref name="Kucers 6ed" /> Clinafloxacin has induced the accumulation of CYP1A2 substrates, including [[theophylline]], at therapeutic doses.<ref name="Kucers 6ed" /> This can also affect the metabolism of caffeine, another CYP1A2 substrate. Caffeine consumption must be limited while taking clinafloxacin to prevent caffeine accumulation and overdose.<ref name="FLQ PK Review" />

There is also a known interaction of clinafloxacin with [[phenytoin]], resulting in a decrease in the clearance of phenytoin from the body.<ref name="Kucers 6ed" /> The increase in INR seen in patients taking both clinafloxacin and the [[anticoagulant]] [[warfarin]] has yet to be fully elucidated.<ref name="Kucers 6ed" />
===Food-drug interactions===
There are no known food-drug interactions with clinafloxacin.<ref name="FLQ PK Review" />

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===
Clinafloxacin's antibiotic mechanism of action, like other [[fluoroquinolones]] is derived from its activity against type II topoisomerases [[DNA gyrase]] and [[topoisomerase IV]].<ref name="PubChem">{{cite web|title=CLINAFLOXACIN|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/clinafloxacin|website=pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine|accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref>

Clinafloxacin has been described as a [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]] due to its activity against [[Gram-positive bacteria|Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative bacteria]]. In addition, clinafloxacin has antibiotic activity against [[anaerobic bacteria]], including the [[facultative anaerobe]] ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''.<ref name="Nord CE Review" /> Clinafloxacin's activity against anaerobic bacteria is higher than that of most other fluoroquinolones, including [[ciprofloxacin]], [[levofloxacin]], and [[moxifloxacin]].<ref name="Appebaum">{{cite journal|last1=Appelbaum|first1=PC|title=Quinolone activity against anaerobes.|journal=Drugs|date=1999|volume=58 Suppl 2|pages=60-4|pmid=10553708|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10553708|accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref>

===Pharmacokinetics===
The time that it takes for [[Serum (blood)|serum]] concentrations of clinafloxacin to reach the maximum concentration ([[Cmax (pharmacology)|Cmax]]) in healthy volunteers after taking a dose by mouth is 0.7 hours.<ref name="Nord CE Review" /> The elimination half-life in humans is 6.1 hours.<ref name="Nord CE Review" /> [[Pharmacokinetics#steady_state|Steady state]] levels of clinafloxacin are achieved in 3 days of twice daily dosing by mouth in healthy volunteers.<ref name="Kucers 6ed" />

About half of an administered clinafloxacin dose is found unchanged in the urine, meaning that the drug is cleared from the blood stream roughly equally by [[hepatic metabolism]] (liver-induced degradation) and [[renal clearance|renal elimination]] (kidney-mediated removal).<ref name="Kucers 6ed" />

==Chemistry==
Clinafloxacin is a [[fluoroquinolone]], structurally related to other fluoroquinolones like [[ciprofloxacin]].<ref name="PubChem" /> It is soluble in methanol (about 2 mg/mL at 25 °C) and water.<ref name="SCBT">{{cite web|title=Clinafloxacin Hydrochloride (CAS 105956-99-8)|url=https://www.scbt.com/scbt/product/clinafloxacin-hydrochloride-105956-99-8|website=scbt.com|publisher=Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc|accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref>

==History==
In the 1990s, clinafloxacin showed promise as a novel, broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic. However, further clinical trials raised serious concerns regarding its safety in humans, citing [[hypoglycemia|dangerously low blood sugar]], [[phototoxicity|drug-induced light sensitivity]], and multiple [[drug-drug interaction|drug-drug interactions]].<ref name="Kucers 6ed" />

==Research==
Clinical trials have been done to assess its efficacy in [[sepsis]] and other serious and potentially life-threatening infections.<ref name="Kucers 6ed" />
