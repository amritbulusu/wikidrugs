'''Perampanel''' (sold under the trade name '''Fycompa''') is an [[antiepileptic]] [[drug]] developed by [[Eisai Co.]] that is used in addition to other drugs to treat [[partial seizures]] and generalized [[tonic-clonic seizures]] for people older than 12 years.<ref name=LabelFDA>FDA [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2016/208277s000lbl.pdf Fycompa Label Tablets and Oral Suspension] Label updated April 2016, accessed August 2016</ref> It was first approved in 2012 and as of 2016 its optimal role in the treatment of epilepsy relative to other drugs was not clear.<ref name=Besag2016rev>{{cite journal|last1=Besag|first1=FM|last2=Patsalos|first2=PN|title=Clinical efficacy of perampanel for partial-onset and primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures.|journal=Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment|date=2016|volume=12|pages=1215–20|pmid=27274257|pmc=4876101|doi=10.2147/NDT.S83842}}</ref>  It was the first antiepileptic drug in the class of selective [[non-competitive antagonist]] of [[AMPA receptor]]s.<ref name=Chong2016rev>{{cite journal|last1=Chong|first1=DJ|last2=Lerman|first2=AM|title=Practice Update: Review of Anticonvulsant Therapy.|journal=Current neurology and neuroscience reports|date=April 2016|volume=16|issue=4|pages=39|pmid=26984292|doi=10.1007/s11910-016-0640-y}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
Perampanel is used in addition to other drugs to treat [[partial seizures]] and generalized [[tonic-clonic seizures]] for people older than 12 years.<ref name=LabelFDA/>

A 2016 review found it effective for both indications but due to the newness of the drug was unable to describe its optimal role in the treatment of epilepsy relative to other drugs.<ref name=Besag2016rev/>  A 2014 review of the probability of added benefit of perampanel to the standard of care was unable to come to any conclusions, as no trial conducted by Eisai compared perampanel to a drug within the standard of care, but only to placebo.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (Germany)|title=Perampanel -- Benefit Assessment According to §35a Social Code Book V [Internet].|journal=Extract of Dossier Assessment No. A14-16. IQWiG Dossier Assessment Extracts.|date=13 August 2014|pmid=26677496|url=https://www.iqwig.de/download/A14-16_Perampanel_Extract-of-dossier-assessment.pdf}}</ref>

==Contraindications and drug interactions==
Based on animal data, perampanel may cause fetal harm;<ref name=LabelFDA/> it is not recommended for women of child-bearing age not taking contraception.<ref name=EMAreport/>

People with severe liver impairment or severe kidney disease, including those on dialysis, should not take perampanel.<ref name=LabelFDA/>

Permapanel reduced the effectiveness of levonorgestrel [[oral contraceptives]] by about 40%.    Other antieptilectic drugs that induce cytochrome P450, including [[carbamazepine]], [[phenytoin]], and [[oxcarbazepine]] decrease the effectivenes of perampanel by 50-67%.  Use of perampanel with strong CYP3A inducers like [[rifampin]] or [[St. John’s wort]] is not recommended.  Use of perampanel with CNS depressants like alcohol may increase the effect of the CNS depressant.<ref name=LabelFDA/>

==Side effects==
Fycompa’s label has a [[black box warning]] noting that some people taking the drug have undergone serious psychiatric and behavioral changes. These events occurred in people who had no history of such issues, as well as people who had such a history.  The psychiatric changes included mood changes like euphoric mood, anger, irritability, aggression, belligerence, agitation, and anxiety, as well as psychosis (acute psychosis, hallucinations, delusions, paranoia) and delirium (delirium, confusional state, disorientation, memory impairment).  Behavioral changes included physical assault and homicidal ideation and/or threats.<ref name=LabelFDA/>

Other serious side effects include suicidal thoughts or behavior (like all anti-epileptic drugs), dizziness and gait disturbance, somnolence and fatigue, risk of falls, and increased risk of seizures if the drug is quickly withdrawn.<ref name=LabelFDA/>

In clinical trials, dizziness, somnolence, vertigo, aggression, anger, [[ataxia|loss of coordination]], blurred vision, irritability, and [[dysarthria|slurred speech]] were the side effects that most commonly led people to leave the trial.<ref name=LabelFDA/>

Perampanel is liable to be abused; very high doses produced euphoria responses similar to [[ketamine]], although subjects liked it less and had experienced it more negatively than ketamine; it produced dissociative effects similar to ketamine.<ref name=LabelFDA/> It is designated as a Schedule III [[controlled substance]] by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]].<ref name=LabelFDA/> A study of [[Substance dependence|dependence]] in rats found withdrawal symptoms when the drug was removed; dependence in humans wasn't studied well enough to make generalizations as of April 2016.<ref name=LabelFDA/>  There is limited experience with overdose.<ref name=LabelFDA/>

==Pharmacology==
Perampanel is a selective [[non-competitive antagonist]] of [[AMPA receptor]]s, the major subtype of [[ionotropic glutamate receptor]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Rogawski | first1 = M.

Whole-cell voltage clamp studies have demonstrated that perampanel is a negative allosteric AMPA receptor antagonist.<ref name="Chao2014">{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen CY, Matt L, Hell JW, Rogawski MA |title=Perampanel inhibition of AMPA receptor currents in cultured hippocampal neurons |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=9 |issue=9 |pages=e108021 |date=Sep 17, 2014 |pmid=25229608 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0108021 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0108021 |pmc=4168215}}</ref> Perampanel caused a slow (τ∼1 s at 3 µM), concentration-dependent inhibition of AMPA receptor currents. The rates of block and unblock of AMPA receptor currents were 1.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> and 0.58 s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Perampanel did not affect NMDA receptor currents. The extent of block (IC<sub>50</sub>, 0.56 µM) was similar at all agonist concentrations, demonstrating a noncompetitive blocking action. Parampanel did affect AMPA receptor desensitization, or the ratio of peak to late response to rapid application of AMPA.<ref name="Chao2014"/> Perampanel is a selective negative allosteric AMPA receptor antagonist of high-affinity and slow blocking kinetics, and is not use-dependent.

Perampanel has a prolonged terminal half-life in humans of approximately 105 hours. The drug is 95% bound to plasma protein. Its primary route of metabolism is by [[CYP3A4]]. It does not induce [[P450]] enzymes. About 70% of the dose is excreted in the feces and 30% in the urine; less than 2% of the dose is excreted unchanged into the urine.<ref name=EMAreport/>

==Chemistry==
Perampanel's chemical formula is 2-(2-oxo-1-phenyl-5-pyridin-2-yl-1,2-dihydropyridin-3-yl)benzonitrile; it has a [[bipyridine]] core structure that sets it apart from other [[AMPA receptor]] antagonists.<ref name=Hanada2013rev/>

The tablets contain lactose monohydrate, low substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, povidone, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, polyethylene glycol, talc, and titanium dioxide in addition to the API; the oral suspension contains sorbitol, microcrystalline cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, poloxamer, simethicone, citric acid, sodium benzoate and purified water in addition to the API.<ref name=LabelFDA/>

==History==
It was approved for marketing under the brand name Fycompa by the [[European Medicines Agency]] in July 2012<ref name=EMAreport/> and as of July 2016 was approved as an adjunct treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondarily generalised seizures in people with epilepsy older than 12 and as an adjunct treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures for people older than 12 years who have idiopathic generalised epilepsy.<ref name=EMAreport/>

It was first approved by the FDA under the same brand name in October 2012 and then in June 2015 for the same uses as those in Europe; it was one of four new drugs for epilepsy approved between 2010 and 2016, along with [[clobazam]] (Onfi), [[ezogabine]] (Potiga), and [[eslicarbazepine]] (Aptiom).<ref name=Chong2016rev/>

==Research==
As of August 2016 perampanel had been studied and development discontinued in migraine, multiple sclerosis, neuropathic pain, and Parkinson's disease<ref name=AdisInsight/>
