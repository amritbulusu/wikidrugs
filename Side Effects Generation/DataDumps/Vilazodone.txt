'''Vilazodone''' (United States trade name '''Viibryd''') is a [[serotonergic]] [[antidepressant]] developed by [[Merck KGaA]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20060817005289/en/Clinical-Datas-Vilazodone-Patient-Enrollment-Complete|date=17 August 2006|accessdate=12 April 2014|title=Clinical Data's Vilazodone Patient Enrollment Over One Third Complete|work=Business Wire|publisher=Berkshire Hathaway}}</ref> and licensed by Clinical Data, a biotech company purchased by [[Forest Laboratories]] in 2011.<ref>http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2015/04/13/blend-therapeutics-taps-former-clinical-data-chief-fromkin-as-new-ceo/</ref> Vilazodone was approved in 2011 by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] for use in the United States to treat [[major depressive disorder]].<ref name="approval">{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2111362920110122 | work=Reuters | title=FDA approves Clinical Data Inc's antidepressant | date=January 22, 2011}}</ref><ref name="FDA approves Clinical Data Inc's antidepressant">{{cite news | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2111362920110122 | title = FDA approves Clinical Data Inc's antidepressant| work = Reuters| accessdate = 12 April 2014 | date=January 22, 2011}}</ref><ref name="urlClinical Data, Inc. - Clinical Data, Inc.

== Medical uses ==

According to two eight-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults, vilazodone elicits an antidepressant response after one week of treatment. After eight weeks, subjects assigned to vilazodone 40&nbsp;mg daily dose (titrated over two weeks) experienced a higher response rate than the group given placebo (44% vs 30%, P = .002). Remission rates for vilazodone were not significantly different versus placebo.<ref name=intj>{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=SM|author2=Han, C |author3=Lee, SJ |author4=Patkar, AA |author5=Masand, PS |author6= Pae, CU |title=A review of current evidence for vilazodone in major depressive disorder.|journal=International Journal of Psychiatry in Clinical Practice|date=August 2013|volume=17|issue=3|pages=160–9|doi=10.3109/13651501.2013.794245|pmid=23578403}}</ref>

According to an article on the United States approval of vilazodone written by FDA staff, "it is unknown whether [vilazodone] has any advantages compared to other drugs in the antidepressant class."<ref name="pmid21951984">{{cite journal |vauthors=Laughren TP, Gobburu J, Temple RJ, Unger EF, Bhattaram A, Dinh PV, Fossom L, Hung HM, Klimek V, Lee JE, Levin RL, Lindberg CY, Mathis M, Rosloff BN, Wang SJ, Wang Y, Yang P, Yu B, Zhang H, Zhang L, Zineh I | title = Vilazodone: clinical basis for the US Food and Drug Administration's approval of a new antidepressant | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 72 | issue = 9 | pages = 1166–73 |date=September 2011 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.11r06984| pmid =21951984}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==

On September 6, 2016, the FDA wrote a letter to Forest Labs about Viibryd.  New warnings will be added to the Viibryd label related to a link between the drug and acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis can lead to serious injury and even death. Pancreatitis, especially if it reoccurs, can lead to pancreatic cancer, which is almost always fatal.

Additionally, it is expected that new warnings related to sleep paralysis will also added to the Viibryd label and prescribing information. Sleep paralysis is a condition in which a person is awake but cannot move or speak. Generally, sleep paralysis occurs upon waking and lasts less than one minute. Although sleep paralysis is a serious condition, and can cause psychological harm in the most severe cases, the condition is generally not life threatening.

After a one-year, open-label study assessing the safety and tolerability of vilazodone in people with major depressive disorder, the most common adverse effects were [[diarrhea]] (35.7%), [[nausea]] (31.6%), and [[headache]] (20.0%); greater than 90% of these adverse effects were mild or moderate.<ref name = intj/> Whereas in randomized controlled trials these rates were 28%, 23.4% and 13.3%, respectively.<ref name = intj/> In contrast to other [[SSRI]]s currently on the market, initial clinical trials showed that vilazodone did not cause significant [[Antidepressant#Sexual|decreased sexual desire/function]] as with many other antidepressants, which often cause people to abandon their use.<ref name="approval" />

===Incidence of adverse effects===
Incidence of adverse effects include:<ref name = DM />

;Very common adverse effects (incidence >10%):
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Headache

;Common adverse effects (1–10% incidence)
{{colbegin|2}}
* Vomiting
* Dry mouth
* Dizziness
* [[Insomnia]]
{{colend}}

;Uncommon adverse effects (0.1–1% incidence):
{{colbegin|4}}
* [[Somnolence]]
* [[Paraesthesia]]
* Tremor
* Abnormal dreams
* Libido decreased
* Restlessness
* [[Akathisia]]
* [[Restless legs syndrome]]
* Abnormal orgasms (male persons only)
* Delayed ejaculations (male persons only)
* [[Erectile dysfunction]] (male persons only)
* Fatigue
* Feeling jittery 
* [[Palpitations]]

;Rare adverse effects (<0.1% incidence):
* [[Serotonin syndrome]]—a serious adverse effect characterised by:
**Nausea
**Vomiting
**Mental status change (e.g. confusion, hallucinations, agitation, coma, stupor)
**Muscle rigidity
**Tremor
**[[Myoclonus]]
**[[Hyperreflexia]]—overresponsive/overactive reflexes
**Hyperthermia—elevated body temperature
**Autonomic instability (e.g. tachycardia, dizziness, abnormally excessive sweating, etc.)
* [[Mania]]/[[hypomania]]—a potentially dangerously elated/agitated mood. Every antidepressant has the potential to induce these psychiatric reactions. They are particularly problematic in those with a history of hypomania/mania such as those with [[bipolar disorder]].<ref name = "AMH">Australian Medicines Handbook 2013. The Australian Medicines Handbook Unit Trust; 2013.</ref>

;Unknown-incidence adverse effects:
* Suicidal ideation—all antidepressants can cause suicidal ideation especially in young adults and adolescents under the age of 25.
* Abnormal bleeding—the SSRIs are known for their ability to increase the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeds and other bleeding abnormalities.<ref name = "AMH" /><ref name = "Maudsley">Taylor D, Paton C, Kapur S, Taylor D.

* Seizures
* [[Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion]] (SIADH)—a condition characterised by an abnormally excessive secretion of [[antidiuretic hormone]] causing potentially-fatal electrolyte abnormalities (such as hyponatraemia). 
* [[Hyponatraemia]] (a complication of the former)—low blood sodium.

Vilazodone acts as a [[serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.1 nM; K<sub>i</sub> = 0.1 nM) and [[5-HT1A receptor|5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor]] [[partial agonist]] (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.2 nM; IA = ~60–70%).<ref name = intj/><ref name="pmid15740724">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Hughes ZA, Starr KR, Langmead CJ, etal | title = Neurochemical evaluation of the novel 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist/serotonin reuptake inhibitor, vilazodone | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 510 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 49–57 |date=March 2005 | pmid = 15740724 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2005.01.018 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0014-2999(05)00041-5}}</ref> It has negligible [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for other [[serotonin receptor]]s such as [[5-HT1D|5-HT<sub>1D</sub>]], [[5-HT2A|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]], and [[5-HT2C|5-HT<sub>2C</sub>]].<ref name="pmid15740724"/><ref name="pmid12183683">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Page ME, Cryan JF, Sullivan A, etal | title = Behavioral and neurochemical effects of 5-(4-[4-(5-Cyano-3-indolyl)-butyl)-butyl]-1-piperazinyl)-benzofuran-2-carboxamide (EMD 68843): a combined selective inhibitor of serotonin reuptake and 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) receptor partial agonist | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 302 | issue = 3 | pages = 1220–7 |date=September 2002 | pmid = 12183683 | doi = 10.1124/jpet.102.034280 | url = http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12183683}}</ref> It also exhibits clinically unimportant inhibitory activity at the norepinephrine and dopamine transporters (IC<sub>50</sub> = 56 nM for [[Norepinephrine transporter|NET]] and 37 nM for [[Dopamine transporter|DAT]]).<ref name = DM/>
