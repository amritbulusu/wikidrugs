'''Eletriptan''' (trade name '''Relpax''', used in the form of eletriptan hydrobromide) is a second generation [[triptan]] [[medication|drug]] intended for treatment of [[migraine]] [[headache]]s. It is used as an [[abortive medication]], blocking a migraine attack which is already in progress. Eletriptan is marketed and manufactured by [[Pfizer|Pfizer Inc]]. It is sold in the US and Canada under the brand name '''Relpax''', and in several other countries under the brand name '''Relert'''.

==Approval and availability==
Eletriptan was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) on December 26, 2002, for the acute treatment of migraine with or without [[Aura (symptom)|aura]] in adults.<ref name=accessdata>FDA AccessData entry  for [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/docs/obdetail.cfm?Appl_No=020763&TABLE1=OB_Rx Eletriptan Hydrobromide], accessed March 10, 2010.</ref>  It is available only by [[Medical prescription|prescription]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. It is not intended for the prophylactic therapy of migraine or for use in the management of hemiplegic or basilar migraine. It is available in 20&nbsp;mg and 40&nbsp;mg strengths.

Eletriptan is covered by {{US patent|5545644|U.S. Patent no. 5545644}}<ref name=accessdata/><ref>{{US patent|5545644|U.S. Patent  no. 5545644}}, John E. Macor &  Martin J. Wythes, ''Indole Derivatives'',  August 13, 1996.</ref> and {{US patent|6110940|U.S. Patent  no. 6110940}};<ref name=accessdata/><ref>{{US patent|6110940|U.S. Patent   no. 6110940}}, Valerie Denise Harding, ''et al.'', ''Salts of an anti-migraine indole derivative'', August 29, 2000.</ref>  the FDA lists the patents as scheduled for expiration on December 26, 2016, and August 29, 2017, respectively.<ref name=accessdata/>

==Mechanism of action==
Eletriptan is believed to reduce swelling of the blood vessels surrounding the brain. This swelling is associated with the head pain of a migraine attack. Eletriptan blocks the release of substances from nerve endings that cause more pain and other symptoms like nausea, and sensitivity to light and sound. It is thought that these actions contribute to relief of symptoms by eletriptan.

Eletriptan is a [[serotonin receptor agonist]], specifically an [[agonist]] of certain [[5-HT1 receptor|5-HT<sub>1</sub> family receptor]]s. Eletriptan binds with high affinity to the [[5-HT1B|5-HT<sub>[1B</sub>]]<sub>,</sub> [[5-HT1D|<sub>1D</sub>]]<sub>,</sub> [[5-HT1F|<sub>1F]</sub>]] receptors. It has a modest affinity to the [[5-HT1A|5-HT<sub>[1A</sub>]]<sub>,</sub> [[5-HT1E|<sub>1E</sub>]]<sub>,</sub> [[5-HT2B receptor|<sub>2B</sub>]]<sub>,</sub> [[5-HT7|<sub>7]</sub>]] receptors, and little to no affinity at the [[5-HT2A|5-HT<sub>[2A</sub>]]<sub>,</sub> [[5-HT2C receptor|<sub>2C</sub>]]<sub>,</sub> [[5-HT3|<sub>3</sub>]]<sub>,</sub> [[5-HT4|<sub>4</sub>]]<sub>,</sub> [[5-HT5A|<sub>5A</sub>]]<sub>,</sub> [[5-HT6|<sub>6]</sub>]] receptors.

Eletriptan has no significant affinity or pharmacological activity at [[adrenergic receptor|adrenergic]] [[alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>]], [[alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>2</sub>]], or [[beta-adrenergic receptor|β]]; [[dopamine receptor|dopaminergic]] [[D1 receptor|D<sub>1</sub>]] or [[D2 receptor|D<sub>2</sub>]]; [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor|muscarinic]]; or [[opioid receptor]]s. Eletriptan could be efficiently co-administrated with nitric oxide synthase (NOS's) inhibitors for the treatment of NOS-dependent diseases (US patent US 2007/0254940).

Two theories have been proposed to explain the efficacy of 5-HT<sub>1</sub> receptor agonists in migraine. One theory suggests that activation of 5-HT<sub>1</sub> receptors located on intracranial blood vessels, including those on the arteriovenous anastomoses, leads to vasoconstriction, which is correlated with the relief of migraine headache. The other hypothesis suggests that activation of 5-HT<sub>1</sub> receptors on sensory nerve endings in the trigeminal system results in the inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release.

==Side effects==
Common side effects include [[hypertension]], [[tachycardia]], headache, dizzyness, and symptoms similar to [[angina pectoris]]. Severe allergic reactions are rare.<ref name="AC">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Jasek, W|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2007|edition=62nd|isbn=978-3-85200-181-4|pages=6984–8|language=German}}</ref>

==Contraindications==
Eletriptan is contraindicated in patients with various diseases of the heart and circulatory system, such as angina pectoris, severe hypertension, and [[heart failure]], as well as in patients that have had a stroke or heart attack. This is due to the unusual side effect of coronary vasoconstriction due to serotonin 5HT<sub>1B</sub> antagonism, which can precipitate a [[heart attack]] in those already at risk. It is also contraindicated in severe [[renal]] or [[hepatic]] impairment due to its extensive liver metabolism through [[CYP3A4]].<ref name="AC" />

==Interactions==
Strong inhibitors of the liver enzyme CYP3A4, such as [[erythromycin]] and [[ketoconazole]], significantly increase blood plasma concentration and of eletriptan and should be separated by at least 72 hours. [[Ergot alkaloid]]s, such as [[dihydroergotamine]], add to the drug's hypertensive effect and should be separated by at least 24 hours.<ref name="AC" />
