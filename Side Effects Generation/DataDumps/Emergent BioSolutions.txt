In December 2016, [[Health Canada]] approved the purchase of Emergent's new botulism antitoxin called Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent (BAT). The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] and [[Public Health Agency of Canada]] both identified botulism, a type of [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]], as a likely biological threat. Emergent already has a ten-year contract with the Canadian military and national health service to supply BAT that began in 2012.

[[Soligenix]] Inc. and Emergent agreed to establish a “commercially viable production technology” for the development of RiVax, a potential vaccine aimed to protect against [[ricin]] exposure. Currently, there are no treatments for ricin poisoning that have been proven effective. Soligenix is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company that specializes in the development of treatments for rare diseases. A product of [[castor oil]] production, the ricin toxin can be a useful biological weapon due to its extreme potency, stability, and accessibility. The [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]] funded the development of RiVax costing an estimated $24.7 million. The organization also financially backed the contract between Emergent and Soligenix. Most of the work will be conducted in Baltimore, Maryland, at Emergent’s manufacturing facility.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/featured/20659-soligenix-emergent-biosolutions-extend-development-agreement-rivax-drug-substance-protein-antigen/|title=Soligenix, Emergent Biosolutions extend development agreement for RiVax drug substance protein antigen|last=|first=|date=2017-01-05|work=|newspaper=Homeland Preparedness News|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-20|via=}}</ref>

== Public affairs ==
Emergent Biosolutions was among many companies giving financial support to delegations at both major party political conventions in the summer of 2016. The conventions used the contributions for receptions, food and transportation, but by law could not use contributions to fund campaigns. For example, Emergent hosted a breakfast reception at the [[2016 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] in Philadelphia. The company sent representatives to both conventions with the aim of specifically meeting with Maryland delegates to educate the delegates about medical countermeasures.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-rnc-convention-sponsors-20160720-story.html|title=State issues, money follow delegates to conventions|last=Fritze|first=John|date=2016-07-20|work=The Baltimore Sun|access-date=2016-08-01|via=}}</ref>
