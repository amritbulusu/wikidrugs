==Chemical structure and properties==
{{expand section|1=source-based description of structure and properties|small=no|date=May 2015}}
This compound has [[tertiary amine]] and [[primary alcohol]] groups as functional groups. The alcohol functionality, in combination with the amine and its low molecular weight imparts water solubility on the compound, and makes [[carboxylate ester|ester]] derivatives possible; the amine functionality gives the compound its alkaline character, and allows for formulation of salts of the compound.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Safety and Toxicity===
Although preliminary, it seems that DMAE may aggravate or induce the formation of neural tube defects, as evidenced by in vitro studies on mouse embryonic cells.<ref name=pmid11919173>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fisher MC, Zeisel SH, Mar MH, Sadler TW |title=Perturbations in choline metabolism cause neural tube defects in mouse embryos in vitro |journal=FASEB Journal |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=619–21 |year=2002 |pmid=11919173 |doi=10.1096/fj.01-0564fje }}</ref> Under normal conditions, rat embryos uptake [[choline]] and convert it into phosphatidylcholine(PC) as an active substrate. DMAE supplementation seems to replace choline usage when it is present due to higher affinity and competition but fails to convert into PC due to an apparent lack of expression of the enzyme phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase (PeMT) in embryos. This enzyme is absolutely necessary for the conversion of Phosphatidylethanolamine into PC.<ref name=pmid25437>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hirata F, Viveros OH, Diliberto EJ, Axelrod J |title=Identification and properties of two methyltransferases in conversion of phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=75 |issue=4 |pages=1718–21 |year=1978 |pmid=25437 |pmc=392410 |doi=10.1073/pnas.75.4.1718}}</ref>

Essentially, DMAE competitively inhibits Choline uptake during the first few days of neural tube formation (1–10 days after impregnation), but the embryo is not yet able to use DMAE as well as an adult due to an immature CDP-choline metabolic pathway and underexpression of key enzymes.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

These mechanisms should not occur in adult cells due to the activity of the PeMT enzyme and a mature CDP-choline metabolic enzyme pathway.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

High-level inhalational exposure is a documented cause of [[reactive airways dysfunction syndrome]]{{cn|date=May 2017}}.

==Uses==
Its characteristics arise from its chemical features as well as from its overall structural similarity to chemical compounds involved in [[primary metabolism]] and neurophysiology.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
===Biochemical roles===
{{refimprove science|section|date=May 2015}}
{{expand section|1=thorough, secondary source-based explanation of the roles of this metabolite|small=no|date=May 2015}}
According to [http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-524-deanol.aspx?activeingredientid=524&activeingredientname=deanol WebMD]:

"''Deanol is a chemical that is involved in a series of reactions that form acetylcholine, a chemical that is found in the brain and other areas of the body. Acetylcholine is a "neurotransmitter" that helps nerve cells communicate.''

''Deanol is used for treating attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Alzheimer's disease, autism, and a movement disorder called tardive dyskinesia. It is also used for improving memory and mood; boosting thinking skills and intelligence; and increasing physical energy, oxygen efficiency, athletic performance, and muscle reflexes. It is also used for preventing aging or liver spots, improving red blood cell function, and extending life span.''

''Deanol is applied to the skin for reducing signs of aging, particularly loose or sagging skin.''

''Deanol was previously sold by Riker Laboratories as the prescription drug Deaner. It was prescribed for the management of children with behavior problems and learning difficulties. Deanol is not an approved food additive in the U.S., nor is it an orphan drug, as some advertising suggests.'' Dimethylaminoethanol may serve as a precursor of choline in the liver.<ref>Karen E. Haneke & Scott Masten, 2002, "Dimethylethanolamine (DMAE) [108-01-0] and Selected Salts and Esters: Review of Toxicological Literature (Update)," Report on National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Contract No. N01-ES-65402, November 2002, from Contractee Integrated Laboratory Systems, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709, see [http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/htdocs/chem_background/exsumpdf/dmae_update_110002_508.pdf], accessed 28 June 2017.</ref> In the brain, DMAE is incorporated into phospholipids, as phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine (PDME), which can then be converted, via ''N''-methylation, to [[phosphatidylcholine]].<ref>Karen E. Haneke & Scott Masten, 2002, "Dimethylethanolamine (DMAE) [108-01-0] and Selected Salts and Esters: Review of Toxicological Literature (Update)," Report on National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Contract No. N01-ES-65402, November 2002, from Contractee Integrated Laboratory Systems, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709, see [http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/htdocs/chem_background/exsumpdf/dmae_update_110002_508.pdf], accessed 28 June 2017.</ref> As a component of nerve membranes, PDME may increase fluidity and permeability, and acting as an antioxidant.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Topical Use===
DMAE, in the form of facial cream, is being looked at for improving skin quality for aging skin when applied as a 3% facial cream.<ref name=pmid15675889>{{cite journal |vauthors=Grossman R |title=The role of dimethylaminoethanol in cosmetic dermatology |journal=American Journal of Clinical Dermatology |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=39–47 |year=2005 |pmid=15675889 |doi=10.2165/00128071-200506010-00005}}</ref> It shows benefits in improving the appearance of coarse wrinkles, under-eye dark circles, nasolabial folds, sagging neck skin, and neck firmness and is generally very well tolerated.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

====Alzheimer's Disease====
V0191 (DMAE Pyroglutamate) in 55-90 year old persons (mean age 72.2) with mild cognitive impairment taking 1500mg of the supplement daily at breakfast over 24 weeks noted that although there was a trend to more response with treatment than placebo (defined as more than a 4 point improvement on the ADAS-cog rating scale), there were no statistically significant improvements nor improvement on global assessments.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Dubois B, Zaim M, Touchon J, Vellas B, Robert P, Murphy MF, Pujadas-Navinés F, Rainer M, Soininen H, Riordan HJ, Kanony-Truc C |title=Effect of six months of treatment with V0191 in patients with suspected prodromal Alzheimer's disease |journal=Journal of Alzheimer's Disease |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=527–35 |year=2012 |pmid=22330824 |doi=10.3233/JAD-2012-111370 }}</ref>

===Industrial uses===
{{refimprove science|section|date=May 2015}}

DMAE forms a number of salts with melting points below room temperature [[ionic liquids]], (e.g. ''N,N''-dimethylethanolammonium acetate and ''N,N''-dimethylethanolammonium octanoate), which can be used in applications where alternatives to conventional solvents are required.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sanders MW, Wright L, Tate L, Fairless G, Crowhurst L, Bruce NC, Walker AJ, Hembury GA, Shimizu S |title=Unexpected preferential dehydration of artemisinin in ionic liquids |journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry A |volume=113 |issue=38 |pages=10143–5 |year=2009 |pmid=19722599 |doi=10.1021/jp906436e }}</ref>
