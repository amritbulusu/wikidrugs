Carbamazepine is typically used for the treatment of [[seizure disorders]] and [[neuropathic pain]].<ref name=AHFS2015/> It is used [[off-label use|off-label]] as a second-line treatment for bipolar disorder and in combination with an [[antipsychotic]] in some cases of [[schizophrenia]] when treatment with a conventional antipsychotic alone has failed.<ref name=AHFS2015/><ref name="Ceron-Litvoc">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ceron-Litvoc D, Soares BG, Geddes J, Litvoc J, de Lima MS |title=Comparison of carbamazepine and lithium in treatment of bipolar disorder: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials |journal=Hum Psychopharmacol |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=19–28 |date=January 2009 |pmid=19053079 |doi=10.1002/hup.990}}</ref>  It is not effective for [[absence seizure]]s or [[myoclonic seizure]]s.<ref name=AHFS2015/>

==Pharmacokinetics==
Carbamazepine is relatively slowly but well absorbed after oral administration. Its plasma half-life is about 30 hours when it is given as single dose, but it is a strong inducer of hepatic enzymes and the plasma half-life shortens to about 15 hours when it is given repeatedly. {{mcn|date=December 2014}}

== Mechanism of action ==
Carbamazepine is a [[sodium channel blocker]]. <ref>{{cite journal |author = Rogawski MA, Löscher W, Rho JM |title = Mechanisms of Action of Antiseizure Drugs and the Ketogenic Diet | journal = Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med | year =  2016 | volume = 6(5) |pages= a022780 |doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a022780 | pmid = 26801895}}</ref>  It binds preferentially to voltage-gated sodium channels in their inactive conformation, which prevents repetitive and sustained firing of an action potential.  Carbamazepine has effects on serotonin systems but the relevance to its antiseizure effects is uncertain. There is evidence that it is a [[serotonin releasing agent]] and possibly even a [[serotonin reuptake inhibitor]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dailey|first1=JW|last2=Reith|first2=ME|last3=Steidley|first3=KR|last4=Milbrandt|first4=JC|last5=Jobe|first5=PC|title=Carbamazepine-induced release of serotonin from rat hippocampus in vitro|journal=Epilepsia|date=1998|pmid=9776325|volume=39|pages=1054–63|doi=10.1111/j.1528-1157.1998.tb01290.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dailey|first1=JW|last2=Reith|first2=ME|last3=Yan|first3=QS|last4=Li|first4=MY|last5=Jobe|first5=PC|title=Carbamazepine increases extracellular serotonin concentration: lack of antagonism by tetrodotoxin or zero Ca2+|journal=European Journal of Pharmacology|date=11 June 1997|pmid=9218697|volume=328|pages=153–62|doi=10.1016/s0014-2999(97)83041-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kawata|first1=Yuko|last2=Okada|first2=Motohiro|last3=Murakami|first3=Takuya|last4=Kamata|first4=Akihisa|last5=Zhu|first5=Gang|last6=Kaneko|first6=Sunao|title=Pharmacological discrimination between effects of carbamazepine on hippocampal basal evoked serotonin release|journal=British Journal of Pharmacology|date=2001|volume=133|issue=4|pages=557–567|doi=10.1038/sj.bjp.0704104|pmc=1572811|pmid=11399673}}</ref>

==History==
Carbamazepine was discovered by chemist Walter Schindler at J.R. Geigy AG (now part of [[Novartis]]) in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]], in 1953.<ref name=Scott1993>D.F. Scott. "Carbamazepine".

In 1971, Drs. Takezaki and Hanaoka first used carbamazepine to control mania in patients refractory to antipsychotics ([[Lithium pharmacology|lithium]] was not available in Japan at that time). Dr. Okuma, working independently, did the same thing with success. As they were also epileptologists, they had some familiarity with the antiaggression effects of this drug. Carbamazepine was studied for bipolar disorder throughout the 1970s.<ref name="pmid9682927">{{cite journal |vauthors=Okuma T, Kishimoto A |title=A history of investigation on the mood stabilizing effect of carbamazepine in Japan |journal=Psychiatry Clin.

Carbamazepine has been detected in wastewater [[effluent]].<ref name=Prosser>Prosser RS, Sibley PK2. Human health risk assessment of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in plant tissue due to biosolids and manure amendments, and wastewater irrigation. Environ Int. 2014 Dec 5;75C:223-233. {{doi|10.1016/j.envint.2014.11.020}}. {{PMID|25486094}}</ref>{{rp|224}}  Field and laboratory studies have been conducted to understand the accumulation of carbamazepine in food plants grown in soil treated with [[sludge]], which vary with respect to the concentrations of carbamazepine present in sludge and in the concentrations of sludge in the soil; taking into account only studies that used concentrations normally found, a 2014 review found that "the accumulation of carbamazepine into plants grown in soil amended with biosolids poses a ''de minimis'' risk to human health according to the approach."<ref name=Prosser/>{{rp|227}}
