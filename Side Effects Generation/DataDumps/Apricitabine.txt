'''Apricitabine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], codenamed '''AVX754''' and '''SPD754''', sometimes abbreviated to '''ATC''') is an experimental [[nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor]] (NRTI)  against [[HIV]]. It is structurally related to [[lamivudine]] and [[emtricitabine]], and, like these, is an [[analog (chemistry)|analogue]] of [[cytidine]].

==History==
It was first developed by BioChem Pharma (where it was called BCH10618). BioChem Pharma was then sold to [[Shire Pharmaceuticals]] (where apricitabine was called SPD754). Shire then sold the rights to develop the drug to Avexa Pharmaceuticals, an Australian pharmaceutical company.<ref name="aidsmeds">[http://www.aidsmeds.com/archive/apricitabine_1593.shtml AIDSmeds.com - apricitabine<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321211501/http://www.aidsmeds.com/archive/apricitabine_1593.shtml |date=March 21, 2008 }}</ref> {{As of|2009}}, apricitabine has closed its [[clinical trial#Phase III|phase III]] [[clinical trial]],<ref>''[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/166087.php Avexa Closes ATC's Phase III Trial To Evaluate Data]''</ref> and has been granted [[FDA Fast Track Development Program|fast track]] status by the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]].<ref name=AIDSinfo>{{cite web |url=http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov/DrugsNew/DrugDetailT.aspx?int_id=415 |title=Apricitabine |date=March 13, 2007 |publisher=U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] |work=AIDSinfo |accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref>

Avexa announced its decision to end work on apricitabine in May 2010, which Avexa spent more than A$100 million ($90 million) developing and was in the final of three stages of patient studies usually needed for U.S. regulatory approval. Grounds for the shutdown included the inability to find commercial partners for global licensing, concerns about legal protections of the drug in the US market, and difficulty confirming the effectiveness of the drug in patients where other retroviral drugs masked key indicators.<ref>Avexa Company Announcement: [http://www.avexa.com.au/freestyler/files/Avexa%20closes%20apricitabine%20program.pdf Avexa closes apricitabine (ATC) program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821164446/http://www.avexa.com.au/freestyler/files/Avexa%20closes%20apricitabine%20program.pdf |date=August 21, 2011 }}</ref>

In March 2011 it was announced by the company to the [[Australian Stock Exchange]] that the FDA had agreed that a new, shorter, single Phase III trial design, including about 300 patients dosed for 2 weeks, was required before approval.  A similar agreement with the EMA was announced in March 2012.<ref>Avexa: [http://www.avexa.com.au/freestyler/files/961373.pdf Avexa and FDA agree path forward for ATC] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320220219/http://www.avexa.com.au/freestyler/files/961373.pdf |date=March 20, 2012 }}</ref>

In November 2011 the company sought to extend its patents over apricitabine and was in discussions for fast-track approval with European regulators. The company also indicated that clinical trials had shown better-than-expected results from simultaneous provision of the drug alongside two other marketed drugs when compared to those drugs with [[lamivudine]], another NRTI.<ref>Avexa Company Announcement to Australian Stock Exchange: [http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20111123/pdf/422qxbgbg916vp.pdf Avexa files to extend ATC patent life]</ref>

Avexa's latest update in 2013 reported that the drug was still in phase IIb trials and had not yet started phase III.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.avexa.com.au/sites/default/files/asx/ASX%20Release%20Update%20on%20apricitabines%20clinical%20development.pdf |title=Update on apricitabine’s Clinical Development |date=2013-09-14 |accessdate=2014-04-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225224548/http://www.avexa.com.au/sites/default/files/asx/ASX%20Release%20Update%20on%20apricitabines%20clinical%20development.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-25 }}</ref>

==Dosage==
As a monotherapy, 1200&nbsp;mg apricitabine per day reduced the [[viral load]] by up to 1.65 logs (45 fold) in a small, 10-day [[randomized controlled trial]].<ref name="pmid16816554" />  An 800&nbsp;mg dose twice a day is being used in later studies.

==Adverse effects==
Apricitabine appears to be well tolerated. The most common [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]]s associated with its use were headache (although there was no [[statistical significance|significant]] difference between participants who took apricitabine and those given a [[placebo]]), [[nasal congestion]], and muscle pain.<ref name="pmid16816554">{{cite journal |author=Cahn P |title=Efficacy and tolerability of 10-day monotherapy with apricitabine in antiretroviral-naive, HIV-infected patients |journal=AIDS |volume=20 |issue=9 |pages=1261–8 |date=June 2006 |pmid=16816554 |doi=10.1097/01.aids.0000232233.41877.63 |url= |author2=Cassetti I |author3=Wood R |display-authors=3 |last4=Phanuphak |first4=Praphan |last5=Shiveley |first5=Leeann |last6=Bethell |first6=Richard C |last7=Sawyer |first7=James}}</ref> In a six-month trial, common adverse effects were [[nausea]], [[diarrhea]], [[hypertriglyceridemia|elevated blood levels of triglycerides]], and [[upper respiratory infection]]—similar to those of lamivudine; apricitabine was not associated with abnormal [[lipase]] levels, [[myelosuppression|bone marrow suppression]], or [[hepatotoxicity|liver]] and [[nephrotoxicity|kidney]] toxicity.<ref>{{cite conference |vauthors=Cox S, Moore S, Southby J |title=Safety profile of apricitabine, a novel NRTI, during 24-week dosing in experienced HIV-1 infected patients |booktitle=XVII International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2008) |date=August 5, 2008 |location=Mexico City |url=http://www.aids2008.org/Pag/Abstracts.aspx?SID=256&AID=4376 |id=Abstract TUAB0106 |accessdate=2008-08-29|display-authors=etal}} [http://www.hivandhepatitis.com/2008icr/AIDS2008/docs/082208_c.html Lay summary]</ref> No patients in either study had to stop taking apricitabine because of side effects.

==Drug resistance==
''In vitro'', apricitabine is effective against NRTI-(lamivudine and [[zidovudine]])-[[drug resistance|resistant]] virus strains, including M184V and multiple [[thymidine]] analogue mutations (TAMs).

In early studies, no mutations causing drug resistance were observed. Newer trials showed that apricitabine may induce K65R mutations, resulting in resistance against [[didanosine]] and [[tenofovir]].<ref name="aidsmeds"/>

In clinical studies, apricitabine has been good at reducing viral loads while apparently producing little selection pressure, resulting in the addition of no further mutations in treatment-experienced patients with common pre-existing mutations, including M184V or K65R or TAMs (M41L, M184V, and T215Y).<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Oliveira | first1 = M. | last2 = Moisi | first2 = D. | last3 = Spira | first3 = B. | last4 = Cox | first4 = S. | last5 = Brenner | first5 = B.
