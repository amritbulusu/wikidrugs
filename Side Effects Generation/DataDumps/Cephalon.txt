'''Cephalon, Inc.''' was a U.S. [[biopharmaceutical]] [[company]] co-founded in 1987 by [[Frank_Baldino,_Jr.|Frank Baldino, Jr]], pharmacologist,  Michael Lewis, neuroscientist and James C. Kauer, organic chemist, all three former scientists with the [[DuPont Company]]. Baldino served as the company's chairman and chief executive officer until his death in December 2010.<ref name=NYTBaldino>Meier, Barry. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/22/business/22baldino.html "Frank Baldino Jr., Founder of Pharmaceutical Company, Dies at 57"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 21, 2010. Retrieved December 24, 2010.</ref>  The company's name comes from the adjective "cephalic" meaning "related to the head or brain," and it was established primarily to pursue treatments for [[neurodegenerative disease]]s.

In the early years, Cephalon initially avoided involving itself in activities that would require maintaining a sales staff, managing clinical trials, and shepherding new drugs through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process. With no product to sell, Cephalon's only asset was its scientific expertise. That expertise proved sufficient to attract investors, and the company managed to fund its operations through research grants and contracts with larger pharmaceutical firms.<ref>{{Cite web|title = History of Cephalon, Inc. – FundingUniverse|url = http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/cephalon-inc-history/|website = www.fundinguniverse.com|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}</ref>

Sales revenues reached $2.8 billion in 2010, ranking Cephalon among the leading biopharmaceutical companies in the world.  In 2006, industry publication MedAd News named the company one of the ten most respected biotechnology firms in the world.  Cephalon employs more than 3,700.

Cephalon was first included in the Fortune 1000 list of U.S. companies based upon annual revenues for 2006.

On May 2, 2011, [[Teva Pharmaceutical Industries|Teva]] announced its acquisition of Cephalon.<ref>http://maya.tase.co.il/bursa/report.asp?report_cd=639962-00&Type=Pdf</ref>

==Background==
The company's early research efforts were focused on the development of [[IGF-1]], an [[insulin-like growth factor]], under a collaboration with [[Chiron Corporation]] to treat [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], or Lou Gehrig's Disease, but the product has never been approved.

The company developed and commercialized products for the treatment of sleep disorders, pain, addiction and cancer, establishing the "wake franchise" on the basis of Provigil (Modafinil) and later Nuvigil, with the R-enantiomer of modafinil.  In addition to conducting research on [[kinase inhibitor]]s and other small molecules, it has licensed compounds and acquired both products and other companies, including [[CIMA Labs]], [[Anesta]], and [[Laboratoire Lafon]]. It was from the latter company that Cephalon obtained the rights to [[modafinil]], which it marketed under the trade name Provigil for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness associated with [[narcolepsy]], [[sleep apnea]] and [[shift work sleep disorder]].<ref name=NYTBaldino/> Sales of Provigil reached nearly one billion dollars in 2008, by which time the company had acquired Lafon.

In February 2009, Cephalon announced its intention to acquire Australian biotechnology firm Arana Therapeutics, a move that represented one of the largest changes in the Australian life sciences landscape. The acquisition of Arana brought Cephalon its lead biologic candidate ART621 for inflammatory diseases. Moreover, Cephalon acquired biologics for the treatment of cancers.  In February 2010, Cephalon exercised its option to acquire Ception Therapeutics, following receipt of positive data from a clinical study in adults with eosinophilic asthma. Commenting on this Frank Baldino, Jr, the CEO of Cephalon, said “The acquisition of Ception is consistent with our strategy to diversify into biologics and provides us with an important phase three asset for further development.”<ref>[http://www.infogrok.com/index.php/pharmaceutical/cephalon-to-acquire-ception-therapeutics.html Cephalon To Acquire Ception Therapeutics].   {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wB4UwKNA?url=http://www.infogrok.com/index.php/pharmaceutical/cephalon-to-acquire-ception-therapeutics.html |date=February 1, 2011 }}</ref> 

{{anchor|chemgenex}}Cephalon acquired [[ChemGenex|ChemGenex Pharmaceuticals]], which provided Cephalon with marketing rights to [[Omapro]], a therapeutic agent for drug-resistant [[Chronic myelogenous leukemia|CML]].<ref>{{Citation|last = Bennett | first = Simeon | date = March 29, 2011| title = Cephalon agrees to acquire ChemGenex: Potential leukemia drug key to $230M purchase| periodical = Delaware Online | publisher = Bloomberg News| url = http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20110330/BUSINESS/103300304/-1/NLETTER01/Cephalon-agrees-to-acquire-ChemGenex| accessdate = March 30, 2011 }}</ref>

==Legal issues==
Cephalon settled a lawsuit for $17 million in which it faced claims that Baldino and other company executives had overstated the potential for a drug aimed at treating [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (known informally as Lou Gehrig's disease).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/14/Cephalon-Inc.html |title=Cephalon, Inc. - Company Profile, Information, Business Description, History, Background Information on Cephalon, Inc. |publisher=Referenceforbusiness.com |date= |accessdate=April 18, 2012}}</ref> The [[Federal Trade Commission]] claimed that Cephalon had made improper deals to postpone the availability of generic versions of modafinil.<ref name=NYTBaldino/> In September 2008, Cephalon paid $425 million to the federal government to settle four whistleblower lawsuits and a criminal  charge alleging Cephalon had marketed Actiq, Gabitril and Provigil for “off-label” (unapproved) uses.<ref name="cephalon pays">[http://www.phillipsandcohen.com/2008/Cephalon-pays-425-million-to-settle-unique-off-label-marketing-case-brought-by-whistleblower.shtml "Cephalon pays $425 million to settle unique off-label marketing case brought by whistleblower"], Phillips and Cohen LLP Press Release, September 29, 2008.</ref>
