Using Chicago's rail infrastructure, much of which was created in the 19th century, the [[Illinois General Assembly]] established the RTA, and later Metra, to serve commuters by rail. Metra's creation was a result of the anticipated failure of commuter service operated and owned by various private [[railroad]] companies in the 1970s. Freight rail companies still operate some routes; however, these operations are guided by [[contract]]ed service agreements. Metra owns all [[rolling stock]] and is responsible for all stations along with the respective municipalities. Since its inception, Metra has directed more than $5 billion into the commuter rail system of the Chicago metropolitan area.

==History==
{{see also|History of passenger rail in Chicago}}

=== Early Chicago commuter rail ===
Since its founding in the 19th century, Chicago has been a major Midwestern hub in the North American rail network.<ref name=ChicagoHistoryEncyc-Railroads>{{cite web  | title = Railroads | work = Encyclopedia of Chicago | publisher = Chicago Historical Society | url = http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1039.html | date = January 23, 2009 | accessdate = May 12, 2011}}</ref> It has more trackage radiating in more directions than any other city in North America.<ref name=ChicagoHistoryEncyc-Railroads /> Railroads set up their headquarters in the city and Chicago became a center for building freight cars, passenger cars and diesel locomotives.

By the 1930s Chicago had the world's largest public transportation system, but commuter rail services started to decline.<ref name=UIC-CCRC>{{cite web  | title = Chicago Commuter Rail Collection | work = Special Collection Finding Aids | publisher = [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] | url = http://www.uic.edu/depts/lib/specialcoll/services/rjd/findingaids/CCRb.html | date = August 17, 2006  | accessdate = May 12, 2011}}</ref> By the mid-1970s, the commuter lines faced an uncertain future. The [[Burlington Northern]], [[Milwaukee Road]], [[Chicago and North Western]] and [[Illinois Central]] were losing money and were using [[passenger car (rail)|passenger cars]] dating as far back as the 1920s.<ref name=ChicagoTransitRailfan-MetraHistory>{{cite web  | title = Metra History  | first = Bill | last= Vandervoort | work = Metra Railfanning | url = http://web.me.com/willvdv/chirailfan/hismetra.html | date = October 12, 2010 | accessdate = May 12, 2011}}</ref>

=== Formation of the RTA ===
To provide stability to the commuter rail system, the [[Illinois General Assembly]] formed the [[Regional Transportation Authority (Illinois)|Regional Transportation Authority]] in 1974.<ref name=Metra-History>{{cite web|title=Metra History |work=About Metra |publisher=Metra |url=http://metrarail.com/metra/en/home/about_metra/leadership/metra_history.html |date=April 19, 2011 |accessdate=May 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903123119/http://metrarail.com/metra/en/home/about_metra/leadership/metra_history.html |archivedate=September 3, 2011 |df= }}</ref> Its purpose was to fund and plan the Chicago region's public transportation. In the beginning the Regional Transportation Authority commuter train fleet consisted of second-hand equipment, until 1976 when the first order of new [[EMD F40PH]] locomotives arrived. That F40PH fleet is still in service today.<ref name=ChicagoTransitRailfan-MetraHistory />

Less than a decade later the Regional Transportation Authority was already suffering from ongoing financial problems. In 1983 the Illinois Legislature reorganized the agency. That reorganization left the Regional Transportation Authority in charge of day-to-day operations of all bus, heavy rail and commuter rail services throughout the Chicago metropolitan area. It was also responsible for directing fare and service levels, setting up budgets, finding sources for capital investment and planning.<ref name=Metra-History />

=== Metra branding ===
[[File:Metra 614.jpg|thumb|right|Metra 614 in [[Chicago]].]]
Due to the broad range of responsibilities entrusted with the Regional Transportation Authority, the Commuter Rail Service Board was created in 1984. It was renamed Metra in July 1985.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-07-11/news/8502140915_1_rail-board-metra-regional-transportation-authority | work=Chicago Tribune | title=Rail Board To Assume New Identity: Metra | date=July 11, 1985}}</ref> The newly reorganized Metra service helped to bring a single identity to the many infrastructure components serviced by the Regional Transportation Authority's commuter rail system.<ref name=Metra-History />
Metra's operating arm, the Northeast Illinois Regional Commuter Railroad Corporation, was created as a separate rail subsidiary which operates seven Metra owned routes. Contracts were set up with the [[Union Pacific]] and [[BNSF]] railroads to operate four other Metra routes. While Metra owns all rolling stock and is responsible for most stations on those routes, the freight carriers use their own employees and control the right-of-way for those routes. In keeping with Metra's purpose to provide a single identity for commuter rail in the region, the freight operators provide service under the Metra name.<ref name=Metra-History />

=== Growth, corruption and expansion ===
In the late 20th and early 21st century Metra experienced record ridership and expanded its services. In 1996 Metra organized its first new line, the [[North Central Service]], running from Union Station to Antioch. By 2006 it added new intermediate stops to that same route, extended the Union Pacific / West Line from Geneva to Elburn and extended SouthWest Service from Orland Park to Manhattan. In 2012 it boasted 95.8% average [[on-time performance]] (measured only for a train's arrivals at its last station no more than six minutes late).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metrarail.com/content/dam/metra/documents/ridership_reports/On_Time_Performance/OTPreport2012M12.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204041810/http://metrarail.com/content/dam/metra/documents/ridership_reports/On_Time_Performance/OTPreport2012M12.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-04 |df= }}</ref> It also posted its fourth highest volume in its history despite decreases in employment opportunities in downtown Chicago.<ref name=Metra-AnnualRidership>{{cite web|title=Metra Ridership Reports – Annual Ridership |work=Metra Annual Report |publisher=Metra |url=http://metrarail.com/metra/en/home/about_metra/planning_records_reports/ridership_reports/annual_ridership.html |date=March 10, 2012 |accessdate=May 4, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527172814/http://metrarail.com/metra/en/home/about_metra/planning_records_reports/ridership_reports/annual_ridership.html |archivedate=May 27, 2012 |df= }}</ref>

Metra continued to seek expansion options and to improve passenger service. Over the past three decades, Metra has invested more than $5 billion into its infrastructure. That investment has been used to purchase new rolling stock, build new stations, renovate tracks, modernize signal systems and upgrade support facilities.<ref name=Metra-History /> In addition to core improvements on the [[Union Pacific/Northwest Line|Union Pacific Northwest]] and [[Union Pacific/West Line|Union Pacific West]] routes, planning advanced on two new Metra routes, [[SouthEast Service (Metra)|SouthEast Service]] and the [[Suburban Transit Access Route]].<ref name=Metra-Connects>{{cite web|title=Metra Connects |publisher=Metra |url=http://metraconnects.metrarail.com/index.php |accessdate=May 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714080431/http://www.metraconnects.metrarail.com/index.php |archivedate=July 14, 2011 |df= }}</ref>

Metra also has been marred by allegations and investigations of corruption. In April 2010 Metra's executive director, Phil Pagano, faced investigation for taking an unauthorized $56,000 bonus and was later found to have improperly received $475,000 in vacation pay. The day that the agency's board was scheduled to discuss his fate, Pagano stepped in front of a moving Metra train in an apparent suicide. Around the time of Pagano's death, allegations also surfaced that a Metra employee demanded a $2,000 payoff from the studio that used Metra in the 2011 film ''[[Source Code]]''. That employee was later relieved of his duties.<ref name=Tribune-SourceCodePayoff>{{cite news |title = Metra probe of alleged shakedown got lost in 'chaos' following agency pay scandal |date = April 14, 2011|author = Wronski, Richard |author2 = Metz, Nina |url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-04-14/news/ct-met-metra-extortion-20110414_1_metra-probe-transit-agency-metra-official |newspaper = Chicago Tribune|location = [[Chicago]] | accessdate = May 12, 2011}}</ref>

In June 2013, Metra CEO Alex Clifford abruptly resigned his position with no public comment. It gradually was reported that his exit had been demanded by the Metra board, which negotiated a $871,000 severance package including a [[non-disclosure agreement]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/chicago/news/2013/08/21/rta-report-blasts-metra-over-clifford.html | title=RTA report blasts Metra board over Clifford severance}}</ref> Clifford's ouster was allegedly arranged because he rejected requests for [[patronage]] hiring and promotion, including a request to promote a longtime supporter of State Representative [[Michael Madigan]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-07-12/news/chi-former-metra-ceo-cites-madigan-influence-in-downfall-20130712_1_memo-metra-ceo-alex-clifford-inspector-general | work=Chicago Tribune | title=Metra CEO memo alleges more Madigan influences | date=July 12, 2013}}</ref> In the wake of this scandal, five board members resigned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abc7chicago.com/archive/9207882/|title=5th Metra board member, Stanley Rakestraw, resigns under pressure from Toni Preckwinkle|first=Eric|last=Horng|work=abc7chicago.com|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref> In August 2013, the remaining board members unanimously elected Don Orseno as interim CEO. (The six-member board was operating with reduced membership and thus lacked the authority to elect a permanent CEO. Orseno and Alex Wiggins shared duties as co-executive directors.) Orseno's long railroad career, beginning with work to set up trains and check doors for the [[Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad]] played favorably in the board's decision.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/22186467-418/metra-names-railroad-man-as-interim-ceo.html|title=Metra names ‘railroad man’ as interim CEO |last=Rossi|first=Rosalind|date=August 27, 2013|work=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=August 28, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/ct-met-metra-board-meeting-20130828,0,2334060.story|title=Veteran 'railroad guy' takes over at Metra |last=Wronski|first=Richard|author2=Stacy St. Clair|date=August 28, 2013|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=August 28, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2013/08/27/metra-board-picks-railroad-man-as-interim-ceo/|title=Metra Board Picks ‘Railroad Man’ As Interim Director|date=August 27, 2013|work=CBS Chicago|accessdate=August 28, 2013}}</ref> By October 2013, local officials had restored Metra's board to 11 members.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-10-21/news/ct-met-metra-board-20131019_1_new-board-members-new-ventra-fare-card-cook-county-commissioners|title=New board members take seats at Metra|date=October 21, 2013|work=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=March 11, 2014}}</ref> After reviewing four candidates, the re-constituted board formally appointed Orseno CEO of Metra in January 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-01-31/news/chi-metra-ceo-20140131_1_alex-clifford-metra-chief-executive-acting-chairman-jack-partelow|title=Former train engineer Orseno named Metra chief executive|date=January 31, 2014|work=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=March 11, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-01-30/news/ct-metra-executive-director-met-20140130_1_acting-chairman-jack-partelow-don-orseno-second-largest-commuter-rail-agency|title=Metra's board faces decision on new executive director|date=January 30, 2014|work=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=March 11, 2014}}</ref>

== Operations ==
[[File:Geneva Metra 071020.jpg|thumb|right|Passengers near an inbound train at [[Geneva (Metra)|Geneva Station]].]]

=== Stations ===
{{mainlist|List of Metra stations}}
Metra services passengers through stations throughout the [[Chicago metropolitan area]]. Each station, unless a route or branch terminus, provides travel toward (inbound) and away from (outbound) downtown Chicago. Therefore, a passenger can connect between the city and a suburb or between two points in the suburbs using Metra service. Although Metra's commuter rail system is designed to connect points all over the Chicago metropolitan area, it does provide some intracity connections within Chicago.<ref name=Metra-SystemMap>{{cite web |url= http://metrarail.com/content/metra/en/home/maps_schedules/metra_system_map.html |title= Metra System Map |date= April 3, 2011 |work= Maps and schedules |publisher= Metra |accessdate= May 12, 2011}}</ref>

In downtown Chicago, Metra trains originate from one of four stations. Six lines originate at [[Union Station (Chicago)|Union Station]]. The three Union Pacific lines originate at [[Ogilvie Transportation Center]]. The [[Rock Island District]] originates at [[LaSalle Street Station]], and the [[Metra Electric District]] originates at [[Millennium Station]]. All of these stations are situated within walking distance of the [[Chicago Loop]], so Metra passengers may also transfer to a different Metra line upon their arrival downtown.<ref name=Metra-SystemMap /> Metra's urban-centric service remains popular with suburban commuters working downtown, [[reverse commute]]rs, and those who visit Chicago for recreational activities and [[tourism]].<ref name=Ranney-TF022004>{{cite conference |url=http://www.chicagometropolis2020.org/documents/CM2020Testimony020604.pdf |title= Testimony to the Regional Transportation Task Force |first= George |last= Ranney |date= February 6, 2004 |conference= Regional Transportation Task Force |location= [[Chicago]] |accessdate= May 14, 2011}}</ref>

=== Routes ===
Of Metra's 11 routes, four are operated under contract. The BNSF Line service is operated by [[BNSF Railway]]. The lines out of the Ogilvie Transportation Center (formerly North Western Station) are operated by the [[Union Pacific Railroad]]. Lines not contracted are operated by the '''Northeast Illinois Regional Commuter Rail Corporation''' (NIRC), Metra's operating subsidiary. Inbound trains on every line at all times run through to their Chicago terminus, however, many outbound trains do not run through to their respective lines' terminus (for example, most trains on the Union Pacific/Northwest Line do not run through to Harvard; instead, terminating at Crystal Lake).

====Proposed routes====
Metra proposed two routes in the early 2000s, [[SouthEast Service]], which would connect some portions of the southern suburbs with downtown Chicago, and the [[Suburban Transit Access Route]], which would connect various suburbs with each other without going into the downtown. Both of these proposals are defunct.

=== Connections ===
[[Transportation in Chicago]] consists of a public transportation infrastructure allowing for [[Intermodal passenger transport|intermodal connections]] to local, regional, national and international transportation services. [[Parking lot]]s are available adjacent to most suburban Metra stations for passengers connecting with their train by [[Automobile|car]]. Most parking lots are operated by the municipality they are located in. Fees and fines are also assessed by the local municipality; however, parking is usually free on weekends and most holidays.<ref name=Metra-Parking>{{cite web |url= http://metrarail.com/metra/en/home/utility_landing/riding_metra/parking.html |title= Parking Map |date= February 23, 2011 |work= Riding Metra |publisher= Metra |accessdate= May 14, 2011}}</ref> Mass transit [[Chicago Transit Authority|CTA]] and suburban [[Pace (transit)|Pace]] buses connect with many Metra stations downtown and in the suburbs.

===Positive train control===
In regards to the [[Positive train control|PTC mandate]] that passed [[United States Congress|Congress]], Metra took steps to meet the deadline. Metra concluded that the December 31, 2015 mandate to have PTC running was an unreasonable requirement. This aligns with the stance taken by much of the railroad industry.<ref name="AAR PTC Stance">{{cite web|title=Positive Train Control|url=https://www.aar.org/policy/positive-train-control|website=Association of American Railroads}}</ref> This is due to a variety factors including but not limited to: delays from the government and the fundamental complexity of building a program from the ground up. Moreover, Metra estimates the cost of implementing the system on their {{convert|1100|mi|km}} of track in the Chicago region to be over $200 million.<ref name="Metra PTC Delay">{{cite web|last1=Wronksi|first1=Richard|title=Metra argues for delay of 'fail-safe' rail system|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-04-09/news/ct-met-metra-collision-prevention-20130409_1_metra-rock-island-ptc-safety-system|website=Chicago Tribune}}</ref> The fear is this unfunded mandate will divert scarce capital funds from other essential needs. This includes building and maintaining existing tracks, stations, signals, and other equipment that ensures a safe operating environment for all of Metra’s passengers. However, Metra recognizes the need for PTC but just would like a more reasonable timeline to implement such a program. This recognition is partially based on Metra’s previous accident history. Two noteworthy events were a pair of accidents on the Rock Island District within a span of a couple of years. The first event was a derailment that occurred on October 12, 2003 when a train flew through a 10&nbsp;mph crossing at 68&nbsp;mph. A second very similar occurrence happened on September 17, 2005 but was more serious. This derailment killed 2 passengers and injured 117.<ref name="Metra PTC Delay" /> Both of these incidents could have been prevented if PTC were in place. In both circumstances PTC would have overridden the engineer and slowed the train down to the appropriate speed to prevent an accident from occurring. 
	
Recently, Metra has taken significant steps in the process to fully implementing PTC. On April 22, 2015 the Metra board approved an $80 million contract to Parsons Transportation Group.<ref name="Metra $80million PTC contract">{{cite web|last1=Wronski|first1=Richard|title=Metra to spend $80 million to help launch safety system|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-metra-contracts-met-20150422-story.html|website=Chicago Tribune}}</ref> Parson’s was the sole bidder and speaks to the complexities of the project. They will be in charge of incorporating various devices from GPS, radio, to trackside antennas into one cohesive system. The group has some experience in this sector previously as Parsons worked with the southern California commuter rail agency Metrolink to install their system.

== Fare system and ticketing ==
[[File:Metra bilevel entrance.jpg|thumb|Entrance to a Metra [[bilevel rail car]].]]
Fare is determined by the distance travelled by a passenger. Each station along every route has been placed in a specific zone based on its distance from its respective downtown station. Downtown terminal and downtown stations are classified as zone 'A' and each additional zone generally represents an added {{Convert|5|mi|km}} from the downtown terminus. Multiple stations can be placed in the same zone even though they are on the same line.<ref name=Metra-Tickets /> Fare zones include A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, and M. There are no stations in zone L.

=== Tickets ===
Several ticketing options exist for passengers. Riders may choose to purchase one-way tickets, ten-ride tickets, weekend passes or monthly passes.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web  | title = Tickets | publisher = Metra | url = http://metrarail.com/metra/en/home/tickets.html | date = May 21, 2011 | accessdate = 4 June 2011}}</ref>
*A '''one-way ticket''' is used for one-way travel between two stations. For roundtrip travel, two one-way tickets can be purchased. One-way tickets can be purchased from ticket agents or on the train from a conductor. Conductors will charge an extra $5 if a ticket agent was available at the passenger's departing station.<ref name=Metra-Tickets /><ref>{{Cite web|title = Metra postpones hike in cost of ticket bought on-board - Chicago|url = http://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-politics/7/71/316055/metra-postpones-hike-cost-ticket-bought-board|accessdate = 2015-07-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Ventra app presented at show-and-tell, expected to be rolled out soon|url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-ventra-smartphone-app-met-0321-20150320-story.html|accessdate = 2015-07-29|first = Chicago|last = Tribune}}</ref>
*A '''ten-ride''' provides ten rides between two zones determined at the time of purchase. Ten-rides can be shared between passengers and expire after one year from the date of purchase. Ten-rides can be purchased from ticket agents, by mail or online from Metra's website.<ref name=Metra-Tickets />
*A '''weekend pass''' provides unlimited travel between any and all zones for one passenger on a Saturday and Sunday. Sometimes weekend passes are extended to include holidays adjacent to the weekend. Weekend passes can always be purchased from conductors without a surcharge and from ticket agents. As of 2015, weekend passes cost $8.<ref name=Metra-Tickets />
*A '''monthly pass''' provides unlimited travel between any two zones for one passenger on every day of a respective month. Monthly passes can be used on any line within the specified zones. Monthly passes can be purchased from ticket agents, by mail or online from Metra's website. Monthly pass holders may also purchase a Pace PlusBus card in conjunction with their monthly pass purchase. The PlusBus card provides unlimited rides on all Pace suburban buses.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Changes Coming as Link-Up, PlusBus Cards Transition to Ventra | publisher = Metra | url = https://metrarail.com/metra/en/home/utility_landing/newsroom/newsroom_archive/2013NewsroomArchive/changes_coming_aslink-upplusbuscardstransitiontoventra.html | date =  | accessdate = 20 June 2014}}</ref> A CTA/Pace Link-Up pass is also available for purchase. On CTA buses and the CTA 'L' the Link-Up pass allows unlimited travel during weekday rush hours and on Pace buses it allows unlimited travel anytime. Monthly pass holders may also travel beyond the zones listed on the monthly pass by purchasing incremental tickets from conductors on the train. Incremental tickets cost $1 beyond the first zone and 50 [[Penny (United States coin)|cents]] for every additional zone thereafter. There is no surcharge to purchase incremental tickets for monthly pass holders.<ref name=Metra-Tickets />

===Reduced fare programs===
Metra allows some travellers to purchase reduced fare tickets or even ride for free. These reduced fare and free ride programs are administered by Metra and the [[Regional Transportation Authority (Illinois)|RTA]]. Some pre-college [[student]]s, [[youth]], [[senior citizen]]s, members of the [[United States Armed Forces]] and persons with [[Disability|disabilities]] may qualify for these programs. Time-based and geographical restrictions apply to these programs and passengers must ensure they qualify before attempting to purchase special tickets or ride for free.<ref name=Metra-Tickets />

==Safety and security==
[[File:Metra Trains at Waukeegan.jpg|thumb|right|Metra F40PH locomotives at the [[Waukegan (Metra)|Waukegan Station]].]]
Metra employees, the [[Metra Police Department]] and other public safety agencies are responsible for maintaining safety and security on its lines, aboard its trains and at stations all to various degrees. Although rail transport is one of the safest forms of land travel,<ref name=NTS-Stats>{{Cite report |title=National Transportation Statistics. Table 2-1: Transportation Fatalities by Mode |url=http://www.bts.gov/publications/national_transportation_statistics/html/table_02_01.html |author= U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics |year=2010 |accessdate= May 11, 2011 }}</ref> compromises to Metra's safety and security can occur through pedestrian accidents, [[suicide]] attempts, vehicle collisions, [[derailment]], [[terrorism]] and other [[Train wreck|incidents]]. Failing to maintain safety and security can result in equipment and infrastructure damage, extensive service disruptions, traumatic injuries and [[death|loss of life]]. Therefore, Metra and other agencies consider safety a top priority and dedicate a significant amount of resources to combat these dangers.<ref name=Metra-SchoolSafety>{{cite web |url= http://metrarail.com/metra/en/home/utility_landing/riding_metra/rail_safety_security/school_safety.html|title= School Safety |date= May 14, 2011 |work= Rail Safety & Security |publisher= Metra |accessdate= May 14, 2011}}</ref>

Starting in early summer of 2013 Metra has announced plans to up police patrols on to the seven lines the agency operates: the Milwaukee Districts North and West, the North Central Service, the Heritage Corridor, South West Service, Rock Island and Electric District. The police patrols will not be help on the BNSF and Union Pacific train lines because those line are operated by the railroads that own them and security falls to those companies. When asked why there were increasing patrols spokesman Michael Gillis said, "There is no particular reason, other than the fact that we want to be more proactive and more deliberately visible to our riders,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20130612/news/706129747/|title=Metra ups police presence on trains|first=Marni|last=Pyke|date=12 June 2013|work=dailyherald.com|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref>

===Law enforcement===
The [[Metra Police Department]] is a special law enforcement agency charged with providing police services to passengers, employees, equipment and property. The department has more than 100 [[police officer]]s and is responsible for the safety of all routes and stations.<ref name=Metra-Security>{{cite web|url=http://metrarail.com/metra/en/home/utility_landing/riding_metra/rail_safety_security/security.html |title=Security |date=February 23, 2011 |work=Rail Safety & Security |publisher=Metra |accessdate=May 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110502133826/http://metrarail.com/metra/en/home/utility_landing/riding_metra/rail_safety_security/security.html |archivedate=May 2, 2011 |df= }}</ref> In an effort to help coordinate [[emergency preparedness]] and [[incident management]], all Metra police officers are certified in the [[National Incident Management System]].<ref name=Metra-Emergency>{{cite web |url= http://metrarail.com/metra/en/home/utility_landing/riding_metra/rail_safety_security/emergency_preparedness_public_awareness.html |title= Emergency Preparedness/Public Awareness |date= February 24, 2011 |work= Rail Safety & Security |publisher= Metra |accessdate= May 14, 2011}}</ref> In addition, the Metra police work with the [[Chicago Police Department]] as a member of the [[Chicago Alternative Policing Strategy]].<ref name=Metra-Security /> To date, only one Metra police officer has been killed in the line of duty.<ref name=OfficerDownMemorial>{{cite web|url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/18523-police-officer-thomas-alan-cook|title=Police Officer Thomas Alan Cook|work=odmp.org|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref>

===Rail safety===
The focus on rail safety by Metra comes from many fronts beyond operations including emergency preparedness and public awareness.<ref name=Metra-Emergency /> The setup of [[railway platform]]s, use of [[grade crossing signals]] and [[crossing sequence (railways)|horn blasts]] make up a critical system used to communicate movements of commuter trains to pedestrians and vehicles. Outside of these operational components, Metra aggressively pursues safety through public awareness. Metra utilizes its own [[Operation Lifesaver]] program and uses it to help spread safety messages. Metra also holds events promoting rail safety at schools and organizes a safety poster contest awarding winners with prizes and features their poster on monthly passes and at stations.<ref name=Metra-SchoolSafety />

Metra has been honored with several [[E. H. Harriman Award]]s for employee safety, most recently with a Bronze award in class B (line-haul railroads with between 4 and 15&nbsp;million employee hours per year) for 2005. Previous Harriman Awards conferred to Metra include Gold awards for 2003 and 2004 and a Silver award for 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nscorp.com/nscorp/application;JSESSIONID_nscorp=E0D2wDZLZ8t844Gn6WZDlSVqmCEM2UEJtEicpNZ1tBcpy4wFlISk!-1862265230?origin=content.jsp&event=bea.portal.framework.internal.refresh&pageid=NS+News&contentId=english/nscorp/news/whats_new/whats_new/news051606.html |title=Railroads Set Another Employee Safety Record in 2005 |author=Association of American Railroads (reprinted by Norfolk Southern Railway) |date=May 16, 2006 |accessdate=May 24, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213232521/http://www.nscorp.com/nscorp/application%3BJSESSIONID_nscorp%3DE0D2wDZLZ8t844Gn6WZDlSVqmCEM2UEJtEicpNZ1tBcpy4wFlISk%21-1862265230?origin=content.jsp&event=bea.portal.framework.internal.refresh&pageid=NS%2BNews&contentId=english%2Fnscorp%2Fnews%2Fwhats_new%2Fwhats_new%2Fnews051606.html |archivedate=February 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>

The worst passenger rail disaster in Illinois occurred prior to the formation of Regional Transportation Authority. The [[1972 Chicago commuter rail crash]] consisted of a two train collision on track now used for the Metra Electric District. The collision resulted in 45 deaths and 332 injuries.<ref name=ChiPubLib-1972Crash>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.chipublib.org/004chicago/disasters/ilcentral_crash.html |title=1972, October 30: Illinois Central Commuter Train Crash|publisher=Chicago Public Library|accessdate=2009-07-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927001031/http://www.chipublib.org/004chicago/disasters/ilcentral_crash.html |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}</ref> Two decades later, Metra experienced its first rail disaster, the [[1995 Fox River Grove bus–train collision]].<ref name=NTSB-FoxRiverGrove>{{Cite report |title=
