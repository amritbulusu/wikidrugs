'''Barbital''' (as known in the [[United States]]) or '''barbitone''' (as known elsewhere), marketed under the brand names '''Veronal''' for the pure acid and '''Medinal''' for the sodium salt, was the first commercially available [[barbiturate]]. It was used as a sleeping aid ([[hypnotic]]) from 1903 until the mid-1950s. The chemical names for barbitone are diethylmalonyl urea or diethylbarbituric acid; hence, the sodium salt (known as medinal, a genericised trademark in the United Kingdom) is known also as sodium diethylbarbiturate.

Also barbital is the ending of many barbiturates like [[phenobarbital]]
== Synthesis ==
Barbitone was first synthesized in 1902 by German chemists [[Hermann Emil Fischer|Emil Fischer]] and [[Joseph von Mering]],  who published their discovery in 1903.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Fischer | first1 = Emil | author1-link = Hermann Emil Fischer | last2 = von Mering | first2 = Joseph | title = Ueber eine neue Klasse von Schlafmitteln | journal = Therapie der Gegenwart | volume =  44 | pages = 97–101 | year = 1903 }}</ref> Barbitone was prepared by condensing diethylmalonic ester with [[urea]] in the presence of sodium ethoxide, and then by adding at least two molar equivalents of ethyl iodide to the silver salt of malonylurea or possibly to a basic solution of the acid. The result was an odorless, slightly bitter, white crystalline powder.

Barbitone can also be synthesized in a [[condensation reaction]] from [[urea]] and diethyl-2,2-diethylmalonate, a [[diethyl malonate]] derivative:

==Marketing==
[[File:Bottle for 'Veronal' crystals, Germany, 1903-1950 Wellcome L0057800.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.6|Bottle for "Veronal" crystals, named after the Italian city of Verona, was the first commercially available barbiturate, manufactured by Bayer.]]

Barbitone was marketed in 1904 by the [[Bayer]] company as “Veronal”.  A soluble salt of barbitone was marketed by the [[Schering AG|Schering]] company as “Medinal.”  It was dispensed for “[[insomnia]] induced by nervous excitability”.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title = Veronal | last = Finley | first = Ellingwood | encyclopedia = The American Materia Medica, Therapeutics and Pharmacognosy | year = 1919 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4CMTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA115 | page = 115 | accessdate = 25 July 2015}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=June 2010}} It was provided in either capsules or cachets.  The therapeutic dose was ten to fifteen [[Grain (measure)|grains]] (0.65-0.97 [[gram]]s). 3.5 to 4.4&nbsp;grams is the deadly dose but sleep has also been prolonged up to ten days with recovery.

== Pharmacology ==
Barbitone was considered to be a great improvement over the existing hypnotics. Its taste was slightly bitter, but better than the strong, unpleasant taste of the commonly used [[bromide]]s.  It had few side effects, and its therapeutic dose was far below the toxic dose. However, prolonged usage resulted in tolerance to the drug, requiring higher doses to reach the desired effect. "I'm literally saturated with it," the Russian tsarina [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Alexandra Feodeorovna]] confessed to a friend.<ref>Dehn, Lili ''The Real Tsaritsa'', Boston, Little Brown, 1922, p138</ref> Fatal overdoses of this slow-acting hypnotic were not uncommon. Pioneering aviator [[Arthur Whitten Brown]] (of "Alcock and Brown" fame) died of an accidental overdose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=8746392 |title=Arthur Whitten Brown (1886–1948) – Find A Grave Memorial |publisher=Findagrave.com |date= |accessdate=19 April 2014}}</ref> Japanese writer [[Ryūnosuke Akutagawa]] deliberately overdosed on the drug in 1927.

== pH buffer ==
Solutions of sodium barbital have also been used as [[Buffer solution|pH buffers]] for biological research, e.g., in [[immunoelectrophoresis]] or in fixative solutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.immunologie-labor.com/cellmarker_files/IET_reagents_02.pdf |title=Wolf D.

Ruzin |title=Plant Microtechnique and Microscopy |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1999 |accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref> As barbital is a controlled substance, barbital-based buffers have largely been replaced by other substances.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Monthony | first1 = JF | last2 = Wallace | first2 = EG | last3 = Allen | first3 = DM | title = A non-barbital buffer for immunoelectrophoresis and zone electrophoresis in agarose gels | journal = Clinical Chemistry | date = Oct 1978 | volume = 24 | issue = 10 | pages = 1825–7 | pmid=568042}}</ref>
