'''Artemisinin''', also known as '''''qinghao su''''' ({{zh|c=青蒿素}}), and its [[semisynthesis|semi-synthetic]] [[derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]] are a group of  [[medication|drugs]] used against  ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' [[malaria]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=White NJ |title=Assessment of the pharmacodynamic properties of antimalarial drugs in vivo |journal=Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. |volume=41 |issue=7 |pages=1413–22 |date=July 1997 |pmid=9210658 |pmc=163932 }}</ref> It was discovered by [[Tu Youyou]], a Chinese scientist, who was awarded half of the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|2015 Nobel Prize in Medicine]] for her discovery.<ref name="nobel-2015" /> Treatments containing an artemisinin derivative ([[artemisinin-combination therapy|artemisinin-combination therapies]], ACTs) are now standard treatment worldwide for ''P. falciparum'' malaria. Artemisinin is isolated from the plant ''[[Artemisia annua]]'', sweet wormwood, a herb employed in [[Chinese traditional medicine]]. A precursor compound can be produced using genetically engineered yeast.

Chemically, artemisinin is a [[sesquiterpene lactone]] containing an unusual [[peroxide]] bridge. This peroxide is believed to be responsible for the drug's mechanism of action. Few other natural compounds with such a peroxide bridge are known.<ref name=eic>{{cite journal|title=Artemisinin and a new generation of antimalarial drugs|author=Royal Society of Chemistry|journal=Education in Chemistry|date=July 2006|pages=|url=http://www.rsc.org/Education/EiC/issues/2006July/Artemisinin.asp}}</ref>

Artemisinin and its endoperoxides derivatives have been used for the treatment of ''P. falciparum'' related infections but low bioavailability, poor [[pharmacokinetic]] properties and high cost of the drugs are a major drawback of their use.<ref>[http://www.malariaworld.org/blog/development-novel-antimalarials Development of Novel Antimalarials].

Therapies that combine artemisinin or its derivatives with some other antimalarial drug are the preferred treatment for malaria and are both effective and well tolerated in patients.

The drug is also increasingly being used in ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]'' malaria.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Douglas NM, Anstey NM, Angus BJ, Nosten F, Price RN |title=Artemisinin combination therapy for vivax malaria |journal=Lancet Infect Dis |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=405–16 |date=June 2010 |pmid=20510281 |doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(10)70079-7 |pmc=3350863}}</ref>

==Medical use==

===Uncomplicated malaria===
Artemisinins can be used alone, but this leads to a high rate of [[recrudescence]] (return of parasites) and other drugs are required to clear the body of all parasites and prevent recurrence. The World Health Organization (WHO) is pressuring manufacturers to stop making the uncompounded drug available to the medical community at large, aware of the catastrophe that would result if the malaria parasite developed resistance to artemisinins.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rehwagen C |title=WHO ultimatum on artemisinin monotherapy is showing results |journal=BMJ |volume=332 |issue=7551 |page=1176 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16709988 |pmc=1463909 |doi=10.1136/bmj.332.7551.1176-b}}</ref>

The [[WHO]] has recommended [[Artemisinin-based combination therapies|artemisinin combination therapies]] (ACT) be the first-line therapy for ''P. falciparum'' malaria worldwide.<ref>{{cite book |title=Guidelines for the Treatment of Malaria. |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva |year=2006 |isbn=92-4-154694-8 }}</ref> Combinations are effective because the artemisinin component kills the majority of parasites at the start of the treatment, while the more slowly eliminated partner drug clears the remaining parasites.<ref>{{cite journal |author=White NJ |title=Antimalarial drug resistance |journal=J.

Several fixed-dose ACTs are now available containing an artemisinin component and a partner drug which has a long half-life, such as [[mefloquine]] (ASMQ<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Krudsood S, Looareesuwan S, Tangpukdee N |title=New Fixed-Dose Artesunate-Mefloquine Formulation against Multidrug-Resistant Plasmodium falciparum in Adults: a Comparative Phase IIb Safety and Pharmacokinetic Study with Standard-Dose Nonfixed Artesunate plus Mefloquine |journal=Antimicrob Agents Chemother |volume= 54|issue= 9|pages= 3730–7|date=June 2010 |pmid=20547795 |pmc=2935027 |doi=10.1128/AAC.01187-09 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>), [[lumefantrine]] ([[Coartem]]), [[amodiaquine]] ([[ASAQ]]), [[piperaquine]] (Duo-Cotecxin), and [[pyronaridine]] (Pyramax). Increasingly, these combinations are being made to [[Good manufacturing practice|GMP]] standard. A separate issue concerns the quality of some artemisinin-containing products being sold in Africa and Southeast Asia.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6951586.stm |title=Malaria drugs recalled in Kenya |date=17 August 2007 |work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Newton P, Proux S, Green M |title=Fake artesunate in southeast Asia |journal=Lancet |volume=357 |issue=9272 |pages=1948–50 |date=June 2001 |pmid=11425421 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)05085-6|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

Artemisinins are not used for malaria prophylaxis (prevention) because of the extremely short activity ([[half-life]]) of the drug. To be effective, it would have to be administered multiple times each day.

===Severe malaria===
[[Artesunate]] administered by intravenous or intramuscular injection has proven superior to [[quinine]] in large, randomised controlled trials in both adults <ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Dondorp A, Nosten F, Stepniewska K, Day N, White N |title=Artesunate versus quinine for treatment of severe falciparum malaria: a randomised trial |journal=Lancet |volume=366 |issue=9487 |pages=717–25 |year=2005 |pmid=16125588 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67176-0 |url=}}</ref> and children.<ref name="dondorp 2010">{{cite journal |vauthors=Dondorp AM, Fanello CI, Hendriksen IC |title=Artesunate versus quinine in the treatment of severe falciparum malaria in African children (AQUAMAT): an open-label, randomised trial |journal=Lancet |volume=376 |issue=9753 |pages=1647–57 |date=November 2010 |pmid=21062666 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61924-1 |url= |pmc=3033534|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Combining all trials comparing these two drugs, artesunate is associated with a mortality rate that is approximately 30% lower than that of quinine.<ref name="dondorp 2010" /> Reasons for this difference include reduced incidence of hypoglycaemia, easier administration and more rapid action against circulating and sequestered parasites. Artesunate is now recommended by the WHO for treatment of all cases of severe malaria.

== Mechanism of action ==
As of 2015, the mechanism of action of arteminisins was not known, but the most widely accepted theory was that they are first activated through cleavage after reacting with [[haem]] and [[iron(II) oxide]], which results in the generation of [[Radical (chemistry)#In biology|free radicals]] that in turn damage susceptible proteins, resulting in the death of the parasite.<ref name=Winzler2014rev>{{cite journal | vauthors = Winzeler EA, Manary MJ | title = Drug resistance genomics of the antimalarial drug artemisinin | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 15 | issue = 11 | page = 544 | pmid = 25470531 | doi = 10.1186/s13059-014-0544-6 | pmc=4283579 | year=2014}}</ref><ref name=Cravo2015rev>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cravo P, Napolitano H, Culleton R | title = How genomics is contributing to the fight against artemisinin-resistant malaria parasites | journal = Acta Tropica | volume = 148 | pages = 1–7 | date = Aug 2015 | pmid = 25910626 | doi = 10.1016/j.actatropica.2015.04.007 }}</ref> In 2016 artemisinin was shown to bind to a large number of targets suggesting that it acts in a promiscuous manner.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang J, Zhang CJ, Chia WN, Loh CC, Li Z, Lee YM, He Y, Yuan LX, Lim TK, Liu M, Liew CX, Lee YQ, Zhang J, Lu N, Lim CT, Hua ZC, Liu B, Shen HM, Tan KS, Lin Q | title = Haem-activated promiscuous targeting of artemisinin in Plasmodium falciparum | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 6 | page = 10111 | pmid = 26694030 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms10111 | pmc=4703832 | year=2015}}</ref>

China and Vietnam provide 70% and East Africa 20% of the raw plant material. Seedlings are grown in nurseries and then transplanted into fields. It takes about 8 months for them to reach full size.

Using seed supplied by Action for Natural Medicine (ANAMED), the [[World Agroforestry Centre]] (ICRAF) has developed a hybrid, dubbed A3, which can grow to a height of 3 m and produce 20 times more artemisinin than wild varieties. In northwestern [[Mozambique]], ICRAF is working together with a medical organisation, [[Médecins sans frontières]], ANAMED and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to train farmers on how to grow the shrub from cuttings, and to harvest and dry the leaves to make artemisia tea.

In April 2013, Sanofi announced the launch<ref name="Sanofi and PATH announce the launch of large-scale production of semisynthetic artemisinin against malaria">{{cite web|last=Pantjushenko|first=Elena|title=Sanofi and PATH announce the launch of large-scale production of semisynthetic artemisinin against malaria|url=http://www.path.org/news/press-room/422/|publisher=PATH}}</ref> of a production facility in Garessio, Italy, to manufacture the anti-plasmodial drug on a large scale. The partnership to create a new pharmaceutical manufacturing process was led by PATH’s Drug Development program (through an affiliation with [[OneWorld Health]]), with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and based on a modified biosynthetic process for artemisinic acid, initially designed by [[Jay Keasling]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and optimized by [[Amyris (company)|Amyris]]. The reaction is followed by a [[photochemical]] process creating singlet oxygen to obtain the end product. Sanofi expects to produce 25 tons of artemisinin in 2013, ramping up the production to 55–60 tons in 2014. The price per kg will be $350–400, roughly the same as the botanical source.<ref>Mark Peplow (April 2013).

Retrieved April 19, 2013.</ref> Despite concerns that this equivalent source would lead to the demise of companies, which produce this substance conventionally through extraction of ''A. annua'' biomass, an increased supply of this drug will likely produce lower prices and therefore increase the availability for ACTs treatment.  In August 2014, Sanofi announced the release of the first batch of semisynthetic artemisinin.  1.7 million doses of Sanofi's ArteSunate AmodiaQuine Winthrop (ASAQ Winthrop), a fixed-dose artemisinin-based combination therapy will be shipped to half a dozen African countries over the next few months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercepharmamanufacturing.com/story/sanofi-shipping-new-malaria-treatment-manufactured-semisynthetic-artemisini/2014-08-19|title=Sanofi shipping new malaria treatment manufactured from 'semisynthetic artemisinin'|author=Palmer, Eric|publisher=fiercepharmamanufacturing.com|date=19 August 2014|accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref>

A 2016 systematic review of four studies from East Africa concluded that subsidizing artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in the private retail sector in combination with training and marketing led to increased availability of ACTs in stores, increased use of ACTs for febrile children under five years of age, and decrease in the use of older, less effective antimalarials among children under five years of age; the underlying studies did not determine if the children had malaria nor determine if there were health benefits.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Opiyo|first1=Newton|last2=Yamey|first2=Gavin|last3=Garner|first3=Paul|title=Subsidising artemisinin-based combination therapy in the private retail sector|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=9 March 2016|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd009926.pub2|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009926.pub2/full|language=en|pmid= 26954551|volume=3|pages=CD009926}}</ref>

==Synthesis==

===Biosynthesis in ''A. annua''===
The biosynthesis of artemisinin is believed to involve the [[mevalonate pathway]] (MVA) and the cyclization of [[farnesyl diphosphate]] (FDP). It is not clear whether the [[non-mevalonate pathway]] can also contribute 5-carbon precursors ([[Isopentenyl pyrophosphate|IPP]] or/and [[Dimethylallyl pyrophosphate|DMAPP]]), as occurs in other sesquiterpene biosynthetic systems. The routes from artemisinic alcohol to artemisinin remain controversial, and they differ mainly in when the reduction step takes place. Both routes suggested dihydroartemisinic acid as the final precursor to artemisinin. Dihydroartemisinic acid then undergoes photo-oxidation to produce dihydroartemisinic acid hydroperoxide. Ring expansion by the cleavage of hydroperoxide and a second oxygen-mediated hydroperoxidation finish the biosynthesis of artemisinin.

===Chemical synthesis===
The total synthesis of artemisinin has been performed from available organic starting materials, using basic organic reagents, many times. The first two total syntheses were a "remarkable... stereoselective synthesis" by Schmid and Hofheinz at Hoffmann-La Roche in Basel starting from (−)-[[Menthol#Production|isopulegol]] (13 steps, ~5% overall yield) and a concurrent synthesis by Zhou and coworkers at the Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry from (''R'')-(+)-[[citronellal]] (20 steps, ~0.3% overall yield).<ref name=PirrungMorehad1997>Michael C.

New York:John Wiley & Sons, pp. 90–96.{{ISBN|047012962X}}</ref> Key steps of the Schmid-Hofheinz approach included an initial Ohrloff stereoselective hydroboration/oxidation to establish the "off-ring" methyl stereocenter on the propene side chain; two sequential lithium-reagent mediated alkylations that introduced all needed carbon atoms and that were, together highly diastereoselective; and further reduction, oxidation, and desilylation steps performed on this mono-carbocyclic intermediate, including a final [[singlet oxygen]]-utilizing [[Photooxygenation#Type II|photooxygenation]] and [[ene reaction]], which, after acidic workup closed the three remaining oxacyclic rings of the desired product, artemisinin, in a single step.<ref name=PirrungMorehad1997/><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/ja00341a054 |author1=Schmid G. |author2=Hofheinz W. |title=Total Synthesis of qinghaosu |journal=J.

A wide variety of further routes continue to be explored, from early days until today, including total synthesis routes from (''R'')-(+)-pulegone, [[List of compounds with carbon number 10|isomenthene]],<ref name=PirrungMorehad1997/> and even [[cyclohexenone|2-cyclohexen-1-one]],<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Zhu Chunyin |author2=Cook Silas P | year = 2012 | title = A Concise Synthesis of (+)-Artemisinin | url = | journal = J.

===Synthesis in engineered organisms===
The partnership to develop semisynthetic artemisinin was led by PATH’s Drug Development program (through an affiliation with [[OneWorld Health]]), with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The project began in 2004, and initial project partners included the University of California, Berkeley (which provided the technology on which the project was based – a process that genetically altered yeast to produce artemisinic acid);<ref name="Ball">{{cite journal|last1=Ball|first1=Philip|title=Man Made: A History of Synthetic Life|journal=Distillations|date=2016|volume=2|issue=1|pages=15–23|url=https://www.chemheritage.org/distillations/magazine/man-made-a-history-of-synthetic-life|accessdate=1 February 2017}}</ref> and Amyris, Inc. (a biotechnology firm in California, which refined the process to enable large-scale production and developed scalable processes for transfer to an industrial partner).

In 2006, a team from UC Berkeley reported they had engineered ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' yeast to produce small amount of the precursor artemisinic acid. The synthesized artemisinic acid can then be transported out, purified and chemically converted into artemisinin that they claim will cost roughly $0.25 per dose. In this effort of [[synthetic biology]], a modified [[mevalonate pathway]] was used, and the yeast cells were engineered to express the enzyme [[Amorpha-4,11-diene synthase|amorphadiene synthase]] and a [[cytochrome P450]] [[monooxygenase]] (CYP71AV1), both from ''A. annua''. A three-step oxidation of [[amorpha-4,11-diene]] gives the resulting artemisinic acid.<ref name="Ro DK, Paradise EM, Ouellet M, et al. 2006 940–3">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ro DK, Paradise EM, Ouellet M |title=Production of the antimalarial drug precursor artemisinic acid in engineered yeast |journal=Nature |volume=440 |issue=7086 |pages=940–3 |date=April 2006 |pmid=16612385 |doi=10.1038/nature04640|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

The Berkeley method was augmented using technology from various other organizations.  The final successful technology is based on inventions licensed from UC Berkeley and the National Research Council (NRC) Plant Biotechnology Institute of Canada.

Commercial production of semisynthetic artemisinin is now underway at Sanofi's site in Garessio, Italy. This second source of artemisinin is poised to enable a more stable flow of key antimalarial treatments to those who need them most.<ref name="Sanofi and PATH announce the launch of large-scale production of semisynthetic artemisinin against malaria"/>  The production goal is set at 35 tons for 2013. It is expected to increase to 50–60 tons per year in 2014, supplying approximately 1/3 of the global annual need for artemisinin.

On May 8, 2013, WHO’s Prequalification of Medicines Programme announced the acceptability of semisynthetic artemisinin for use in the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients submitted to WHO for prequalification, or that have already been qualified by WHO.<ref name="Semisynthetic artemisinin achieves WHO prequalification">{{cite web|last=Pantjushenko|first=Elena|title=Semisynthetic artemisinin achieves WHO prequalification|url=http://www.path.org/news/press-room/430/|publisher=PATH|accessdate=8 February 2014}}</ref>  Sanofi’s API produced from semisynthetic artemisinin (artesunate) was also prequalified by WHO on May 8, 2013, making it the first semisynthetic artemisinin derivative prequalified.

In 2010, a team from [[Wageningen University]] reported they had engineered a close relative of tobacco, ''[[Nicotiana benthamiana]]'', that can also produce the precursor artemisinic acid.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = van Herpen | first1 = TW. | last2 = Cankar | first2 = K. | last3 = Nogueira | first3 = M. | last4 = Bosch | first4 = D. | last5 = Bouwmeester | first5 = HJ. | last6 = Beekwilder | first6 = J. | title = Nicotiana benthamiana as a Production Platform for Artemisinin Precursors | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 5 | issue = 12 | pages = e14222 |date=3 December 2010 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0014222 | pmid = 21151979  | editor1-last = Yang  | editor1-first = Haibing  | pmc = 2997059 }}</ref>

== History ==

=== Etymology ===
Artemisinin is an antimalarial lactone derived from ''qinghao'' 青蒿 (''[[Artemisia annua]]'' or [[sweet wormwood]]). The medicinal value of this plant has been known to the Chinese for at least 2,000 years. In 1596, [[Li Shizhen]] recommended tea made from ''qinghao'' specifically to treat malaria symptoms in his "[[Compendium of Materia Medica]]". The genus name is derived from the Greek goddess [[Artemis]] and, more specifically, may have been named after Queen [[Artemisia II of Caria]], a botanist and medical researcher in the fourth century BCE.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Various|date= Jul 2014 |title= Etymologia: Artemisinin|url= http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/7/et-2007_article|journal= Emerg Infect Dis [Internet]|publisher=CDC |volume= 20|issue=7 |page= 1217|doi= 10.3201/eid2007.ET2007|accessdate=July 4, 2014}}</ref>

== Artemisinin derivatives ==
Because the physical properties of artemisinin itself, such as poor [[bioavailability]], limit its effectiveness, semisynthetic [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivative]]s of artemisinin have been developed. These include:

*[[Artemether]] (lipid-soluble: for oral, rectal or intramuscular use)
*[[Dihydroartemisinin]]
*[[Artelinic acid]]
*[[Artemotil]]
