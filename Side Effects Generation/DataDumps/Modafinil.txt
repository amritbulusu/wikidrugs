In English-speaking countries it is sold under the brand names '''Alertec''', '''Modavigil''', and '''Provigil'''. In the United States modafinil is classified as a [[Controlled Substances Act|schedule IV controlled substance]] and restricted in availability and usage, due to concerns about possible addiction potential.  In most other countries it is a prescription drug but not otherwise legally restricted.

Modafinil acts as an atypical, selective, and weak [[dopamine reuptake inhibitor]] which indirectly activates the release of [[orexin]] [[neuropeptide]]s and [[histamine]] from the [[lateral hypothalamus]] and [[tuberomammillary nucleus]], respectively, by unknown mechanisms, all of which contribute to heightened arousal.<ref name="Stahl's Essential Psychopharmacology - Modafinil">{{cite book | vauthors=Stahl SM | title=Prescriber's Guide: Stahl's Essential Psychopharmacology | date=March 2017 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge, United Kingdom | isbn=9781108228749 | pages=491–495 | edition=6th | chapter=Modafinil | accessdate=5 August 2017 }}</ref><ref name="pmid19300566">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gerrard P, Malcolm R | title = Mechanisms of modafinil: A review of current research | journal = Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 349–64 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 19300566 | pmc = 2654794 | doi = | url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid22640618">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ishizuka T, Murotani T, Yamatodani A | title = Action of modafinil through histaminergic and orexinergic neurons | journal = Vitamins and Hormones | volume = 89 | issue = | pages = 259–278 | date = 2012 | pmid = 22640618 | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-12-394623-2.00014-7 | url = }}</ref>

====Occupational use====
{{See also|List of drugs used by militaries}}
Armed forces of several countries are known to have expressed interest in modafinil as an alternative to [[amphetamine]]—the drug traditionally employed in combat situations or lengthy missions where troops face [[sleep deprivation]]. The [[France|French]] government indicated that the [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]] used modafinil during certain covert operations.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] commissioned research into modafinil<ref>{{cite news |author=Wheeler B |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6083840.stm |title=BBC report on MoD research into modafinil |publisher=BBC News |date=October 26, 2006 |accessdate=July 4, 2012}}</ref> from [[Qinetiq|QinetiQ]] and spent £300,000 on one investigation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/health/mod-s-secret-pep-pill-to-keep-forces-awake-1-1387967 |title=MoD's secret pep pill to keep forces awake |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=February 27, 2005 |accessdate=December 31, 2013}}</ref> In 2011, the [[Indian Air Force]] announced that modafinil was included in contingency plans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.punemirror.in/article/2/201102162011021606331644587714a65/Pilot-pill-project.html |title=Pilot pill project |work=News – City |publisher=PuneMirror |date=February 16, 2011 |accessdate=July 4, 2012}}</ref>

In the [[United States]] military, modafinil has been approved for use on certain [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] missions, and it is being investigated for other uses.<ref name="urlwww.dtic.mil">{{cite web |url=http://www.hep.afrl.af.mil/HEPF/Policy/modafinil.pdf |title=Modafinil and management of aircrew fatigue |author1=Taylor GP, Jr |author2=Keys RE |date=December 1, 2003 |format=PDF |work= |publisher=United States Department of the Air Force |accessdate=September 18, 2009}}</ref> As of November 2012, modafinil is the only drug approved by the Air Force as a "go pill" for fatigue management.<ref name=AF48>[http://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/afsoc/publication/afsoci48-101/afsoci48-101.pdf Air Force Special Operations Command Instruction 48–101] (sects. 1.7.4), U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command, November 30, 2012.</ref> The use of [[dextroamphetamine]] is no longer approved.<ref name=AF48/>

The [[Canadian Medical Association Journal]] also reports that modafinil is used by [[astronaut]]s on long-term missions aboard the [[International Space Station]]. Modafinil is "available to crew to optimize performance while fatigued" and helps with the disruptions in [[circadian rhythm]]s and with the reduced quality of sleep astronauts experience.<ref name="pmid19487390">{{cite journal | vauthors = Thirsk R, Kuipers A, Mukai C, Williams D | title = The space-flight environment: the International Space Station and beyond | journal = Cmaj | volume = 180 | issue = 12 | pages = 1216–20 | date = Jun 2009 | pmid = 19487390 | pmc = 2691437 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.081125 }}</ref>

==Contraindications==
Allergy and hypersensitivity are the only contraindications of the drug,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medmerits.com/index.php/article/modafinil/P4|title=Modafinil - Contraindications|publisher=}}</ref> but literature distributed by [[Cephalon]] advises that it is important to consult a [[physician]] before using it, as problems may arise for people who are sensitive to constituents of the tablets, people with [[cirrhosis]] (which may impair the metabolism of the drug), and people with various cardiovascular problems.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Adverse effects==
According to documentation distributed by [[Teva Pharmaceuticals]], one-third of participants in clinical trials reported experiencing headaches; 11% reported nausea; other negative side-effects such as nervousness, diarrhea, insomnia, anxiety, dizziness, and gastrointestinal problems were reported by fewer than 10% of participants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tevausa.com/assets/base/products/pi/Modafinil_PI.pdf |format=PDF |title=Modafinil Information Page |publisher=[[Teva Pharmaceuticals]] |date=February 1, 2012}}</ref>

Rare occurrences have been reported of more serious adverse effects, including severe skin rashes and other symptoms that are probably allergy-related. From the date of initial marketing, December 1998, to January 30, 2007, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] received six cases of severe cutaneous adverse reactions associated with modafinil, including [[erythema multiforme]] (EM), [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]] (SJS), [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]] (TEN), and [[DRESS syndrome]], involving adult and pediatric patients. The FDA issued a relevant alert. In the same alert, the FDA also noted that [[angioedema]] and multi-organ hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported in postmarketing experiences.<ref>{{cite web |title=Modafinil (marketed as Provigil): Serious Skin Reactions |publisher=Food and Drug Administration |year=2007 |url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/dsn/2007_fall/postmarketing.htm#modafinil}}</ref> In 2007, the FDA ordered Cephalon to modify the Provigil leaflet in bold-face print of several serious and potentially fatal conditions attributed to modafinil use, including TEN, DRESS syndrome, and SJS.

==Overdose==
In mice and rats, the [[median lethal dose]] (LD<sub>50</sub>) of modafinil is approximately or slightly greater than 1250&nbsp;mg/kg. Oral LD<sub>50</sub> values reported for rats range from 1000–3400&nbsp;mg/kg. Intravenous LD<sub>50</sub> for dogs is 300&nbsp;mg/kg. Clinical trials on humans involving taking up to 1200&nbsp;mg/day for 7–21&nbsp;days and known incidents of acute one-time overdoses up to 4500&nbsp;mg did not appear to cause life-threatening effects, although a number of adverse experiences were observed, including excitation or agitation, insomnia, anxiety, irritability, aggressiveness, confusion, nervousness, tremor, palpitations, sleep disturbances, nausea, and diarrhea.<ref name="fda_label"/> As of 2004, the FDA is not aware of any fatal overdoses involving modafinil alone (as opposed to multiple drugs, including modafinil).<ref name="fda_label"/>

==Interactions==
Coadministration with modafinil alongside [[opioid]]s such as [[hydrocodone]], [[oxycodone]], and [[fentanyl]], as well as various other drugs, may experience a drop in plasma concentrations. The reasoning behind this action is because modafinil is an [[enzyme inducer|inducer]] of the [[CYP3A4]] [[enzyme]]s. If not monitored closely, reduced efficacy or withdrawal symptoms can occur.{{Medical citation needed|date=October 2015}}

====DAT-independent actions====

In any case, there is nonetheless a good deal of evidence to indicate that modafinil is producing at least a portion of its wakefulness-promoting effects by acting as a DRI, or at least via activation of the dopaminergic system. In support of modafinil acting as a dopaminergic agent, its wakefulness-promoting effects are abolished in DAT [[knockout mice]] (although it is important to note that DAT knockout mice show D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptor and norepinephrine compensatory abnormalities, which might confound this finding), reduced by both [[D1 receptor|D<sub>1</sub>]] and [[D2 receptor|D<sub>2</sub> receptor]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]]s (although conflicting reports exist),<ref name="pmid8998404" /> and completely blocked by simultaneous inactivation of both D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptors.<ref name="Wisor2013" /> In accordance, modafinil shows full stimulus generalization to other DAT inhibitors including cocaine, methylphenidate, and vanoxerine, and discrimination is blocked by administration of both [[ecopipam]] (SCH-39166), a D<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist, and [[haloperidol]], a D<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonist.<ref name="QuisenberryBaker2015" /> Partial substitution was seen with the DRA dextroamphetamine and the D<sub>2</sub> receptor agonist [[PNU-91356A]], as well as with [[nicotine]] (which indirectly elevates dopamine levels through activation of [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s).<ref name="QuisenberryBaker2015" />

Modafinil may possess yet an additional mechanism of action. Both modafinil and its [[metabolite]], [[modafinil sulfone]], possess [[anticonvulsant]] properties in animals, and modafinil sulfone is nearly as potent as modafinil in producing this effect.<ref name="pmid15260124">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chatterjie N, Stables JP, Wang H, Alexander GJ | title = Anti-narcoleptic agent modafinil and its sulfone: a novel facile synthesis and potential anti-epileptic activity | journal = Neurochem.

==History==
Modafinil was originally developed in [[France]] by [[Neurophysiology|neurophysiologist]] and [[emeritus]] experimental medicine professor [[Michel Jouvet]] and Lafon Laboratories. Modafinil originated with the late 1970s invention of a series of benzhydryl sulfinyl compounds, including [[adrafinil]], which was first offered as an experimental treatment for narcolepsy in France in 1986. Modafinil is the primary metabolite of adrafinil, lacking the polar -OH group on its terminal amide,<ref name=Ballas>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ballas CA, Kim D, Baldassano CF, Hoeh N | title = Modafinil: past, present and future | journal = Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 449–57 | date = Jul 2002 | pmid = 19810941 | doi = 10.1586/14737175.2.4.449 }}</ref> and has similar activity to the parent drug but is much more widely used. It has been prescribed in France since 1994 under the name Modiodal, and in the US since 1998 as Provigil.

In 1998, modafinil was approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/may/02/science/la-sci-stay-awake-drug-modafinil-booming-20130502 |title=Use of wake-up drug modafinil takes off, spurred by untested uses – Los Angeles Times |publisher=LA Times |date=May 2, 2013 |accessdate=December 31, 2013 |first=Melissa |last=Healy | name-list-format = vanc }}</ref> for the treatment of [[narcolepsy]] and in 2003 for [[shift work sleep disorder]] and obstructive [[sleep apnea]]/[[hypopnea]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kesselheim AS, Myers JA, Solomon DH, Winkelmayer WC, Levin R, Avorn J |title= The prevalence and cost of unapproved uses of top-selling orphan drugs |journal=PloS One | volume=7 |issue=2 |page=e31894 |date= February 21, 2012 |pmid=22363762 |pmc= 3283698 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0031894 | editor1-last= Alessi-Severini |editor1-first= Silvia }}</ref> even though caffeine and amphetamine were shown to be more wakefulness promoting on the Stanford Sleepiness Test Score than modafinil.<ref name="pmid19300566" />

It was approved for use in the UK in December 2002. Modafinil is marketed in the US by [[Cephalon|Cephalon Inc.]], who originally leased the rights from Lafon, but eventually purchased the company in 2001.

Cephalon began to market the R-enantiomer armodafinil of modafinil in the U.S. in 2007. After protracted patent litigation and negotiations (see [[#Patent protection and antitrust litigation|below]]), [[generic drug|generic]] versions of modafinil became available in the U.S. in 2012.

===Patent protection and antitrust litigation===
{{US patent|4927855}} was issued to [[Laboratoire L. Lafon]] on May 22, 1990, covering the chemical compound modafinil. After receiving an interim term extension of 1066&nbsp;days and [[pediatric exclusivity]] of six months, it expired on October 22, 2010. On October 6, 1994, Cephalon filed an additional patent, covering modafinil in the form of particles of defined size. That patent, {{US patent|5618845}} was issued on April 8, 1997, but was reissued in 2002 as RE 37,516, which surrendered the 5618845 patent. With pediatric exclusivity, this patent expired on April 6, 2015.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2006/03/27/daily13.html |title=Cephalon gets six-month Provigil patent extension |publisher=Philadelphia Business Journal |date=March 28, 2006 |accessdate=July 21, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drugpatentwatch.com/ultimate/preview/patent/index.php?query=RE37516 |title=Details for Patent: RE37516}}</ref>

On December 24, 2002, anticipating the expiration of exclusive marketing rights, generic drug manufacturers Mylan, Teva, Barr, and Ranbaxy applied to the FDA to market a generic form of modafinil.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prescriptionaccess.org/lawsuitssettlements/current_lawsuits?id=0024 |title=Prescription Access Litigation (PAL) Project :: Prescription Access Litigation (PAL) Project :: Lawsuits & Settlements :: Current Lawsuits |publisher=Prescriptionaccess.org |accessdate=July 4, 2012}}</ref> At least one withdrew its application after early opposition by Cephalon based on the '516 patent. There is some question whether a particle size patent is sufficient protection against the manufacture of generics. Pertinent questions include whether modafinil may be modified or manufactured to avoid the granularities specified in the new Cephalon patent, and whether patenting particle size is invalid because particles of appropriate sizes are likely to be obvious to practitioners skilled in the art. However, under United States patent law, a patent is entitled to a legal presumption of validity, meaning that in order to invalidate the patent, much more than "pertinent questions" are required.

As of October 31, 2011, U.S. Reissue Patent No. RE 37,516 has been declared invalid and unenforceable.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/pennsylvania/paedce/2:2006cv02768/205626/514 |title=Document 514 :: APOTEX, INC. v.

Lafon); (3) was obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art under 35 U.S.C. section 103(a); and (4) failed the written description requirement of 35 U.S.C. section 112.<ref name="url_Justia">{{cite web |url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/pennsylvania/paedce/2:2006cv02768/205626/513 |title=Document 513 :: APOTEX, INC. v.

Cephalon made an agreement with four major generics manufacturers [[Teva Pharmaceutical Industries|Teva]], [[Barr Pharmaceuticals]], [[Ranbaxy Laboratories]], and [[Actavis|Watson Pharmaceuticals]] between 2005 and 2006 to [[Reverse payment patent settlement|delay]] sales of generic modafinil in the US until April 2012 by these companies in exchange for upfront and royalty payments.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/873364/000104746909001690/a2190556z10-k.htm |title=Cephalon Inc., SEC 10K 2008 disclosure |pages=9–10 |date=February 23, 2009 |accessdate=August 29, 2009}}</ref> Litigation arising from these agreements is still pending including an FTC suit filed in April 2008.<ref>{{cite news |title=CVS, Rite Aid Sue Cephalon Over Generic Provigil |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=arNEtMSU7D9s |accessdate=August 29, 2009 |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=August 21, 2009}}</ref> [[Apotex]] received regulatory approval in Canada despite a suit from Cephalon's marketing partner in Canada, [[Shire Pharmaceuticals]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mondaq.com/article.asp?articleid=71906 |title=Canada IP Year in Review 2008 |date=January 1, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Shire v.

===Legal status===
==== United States ====
Modafinil is {{As of|2005|alt=currently}} classified as a [[Controlled Substances Act|Schedule IV controlled substance]] under United States federal law; it is illegal to import by anyone other than a [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]]-registered importer without a prescription.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/illegal_internet.html |publisher=[[United States Drug Enforcement Administration]] |title=Is It Illegal to Obtain Controlled Substances From the Internet? |accessdate=July 21, 2007}}</ref> However, one may legally bring modafinil into the United States in person from a foreign country, provided that he or she has a prescription for it, and the drug is properly declared at the border crossing. U.S. residents are limited to 50 dosage units (e.g., pills).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1301/1301_26.htm |title=USC 201 Section 1301.26 Exemptions from import or export requirements for personal medical use |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]] |date=March 24, 1997}}</ref> Under the US [[Pure Food and Drug Act]], drug companies are not allowed to market their drugs for [[off-label use]]s (conditions other than those officially approved by the FDA);<ref>{{cite web |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |title=Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 (PDMA), PL 100-293 |url=http://www.fda.gov/opacom/laws/pdma.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223233036/http://www.fda.gov/opacom/laws/pdma.html |archivedate=February 23, 2008}}</ref> Cephalon was reprimanded in 2002 by the FDA because its promotional materials were found to be "false, lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/EnforcementActivitiesbyFDA/WarningLettersandNoticeofViolationLetterstoPharmaceuticalCompanies/UCM164556.pdfFDA |title=Letter to Cephalon 01/03/2002 |date=January 3, 2002 |accessdate=July 4, 2012}}</ref> Cephalon pleaded guilty to a criminal violation and paid several fines, including {{nowrap|$50 million}} and {{nowrap|$425 million}} fines to the U.S. government in 2008.<ref>"Cephalon executives have repeatedly said that they do not condone off-label use of Provigil, but in 2002 the company was reprimanded by the FDA for distributing marketing materials that presented the drug as a remedy for tiredness, "decreased activity" and other supposed ailments.

===Doping agent===
====Sports====
The regulation of modafinil as a [[Doping in sport|doping agent]] has been controversial in the sporting world, with high-profile cases attracting press coverage since several prominent American athletes have tested positive for the substance. Some athletes who were found to have used modafinil protested that the drug was not on the prohibited list at the time of their offenses. However, the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) maintains that it was related to already banned substances. The Agency added modafinil to its list of prohibited substances on August 3, 2004, ten days before the start of the [[2004 Summer Olympics]].

Modafinil has received some publicity in the past when several athletes (such as sprinter [[Kelli White]] in 2004, cyclist [[David Clinger]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/clinger-given-lifetime-ban-for-second-doping-infraction |title=Clinger given lifetime ban for second doping infraction |publisher=Cycling News |date=August 14, 2011|accessdate=October 8, 2014}}</ref> and basketball player [[Diana Taurasi]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/24/AR2010122402993.html |publisher=The Washington Post |title=Taurasi tested positive for modafinil |date=December 25, 2010 |accessdate=December 31, 2013}}</ref> in 2010, and rower Timothy Grant in 2015<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/23/british-rowers-handed-two-year-bans-doping-violations-sybren-hoogland-timothy-grant|title=British rowers handed two-year bans for taking banned substances|first=Guardian|last=sport|date=November 23, 2015|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}</ref>) were discovered allegedly using it as a performance-enhancing [[doping (sport)|doping]] agent.

A [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized]] [[double-blind study]] of modafinil showed that normal healthy volunteers between the ages of 30–44 showed general improvement in alertness as well as mood. In the three-day study, counterbalanced, randomized, crossover, inpatient trial of modafinil 400&nbsp;mg was administered as well as a placebo to the control group. The conclusion demonstrated that modafinil may have general mood-elevating effects in particular for the adjunctive use in [[treatment-resistant depression]].<ref name="Bonaventure"/>

===Cocaine addiction===
Modafinil is under investigation as a possible method to treat [[cocaine dependence]], for several reasons involving biochemical mechanisms of the two drugs, as well as the observation that clinical effects of modafinil are largely opposite to symptoms of cocaine withdrawal.

The pilot 8-week double-blind study of modafinil for cocaine dependence (2004) produced inconclusive results. The number of cocaine-positive urine samples was significantly lower in the modafinil group as compared to the placebo group in the middle of the trial, but by the end of the 8 weeks the difference stopped being significant. Even before the treatment began, the modafinil group had lower cocaine consumption further confounding the results. As compared to placebo, modafinil did not reduce cocaine craving or self-reported cocaine use, and the physicians ratings were only insignificantly better.<ref name="pmid15525998">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dackis CA, Kampman KM, Lynch KG, Pettinati HM, O'Brien CP | title = A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of modafinil for cocaine dependence | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 205–11 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15525998 | doi = 10.1038/sj.npp.1300600 }}</ref> Dan Umanoff, of the National Association for the Advancement and Advocacy of Addicts, criticized the authors of the study for leaving the negative results out of the discussion part and the abstract of the article.<ref name="pmid16294193">{{cite journal | vauthors = Umanoff DF | title = Trial of modafinil for cocaine dependence | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 30 | issue = 12 | pages = 2298; author reply 2299–300 | date = Dec 2005 | pmid = 16294193 | doi = 10.1038/sj.npp.1300866 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Dackis CA, Kampman KM, Lynch KG, Pettinati HM, O'Brien CP |title=Reply: Do Self-Reports Reliably Assess Abstinence in Cocaine-Dependent Patients? |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=30 |issue=12 |pages=2299–300 |year=2005 |doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1300867}}</ref>

However, the prescribing information for Provigil notes that "There were no clinically significant differences in body weight change in patients treated with Provigil compared to placebo-treated patients in the placebo-controlled clinical trials."<ref name="urlprovigil.com">{{cite web |url=http://provigil.com/media/PDFs/medication_guide.pdf |title=Provigil |date=November 1, 2010 |work=Medication Guide |publisher=Cephalon, Inc. |accessdate=December 31, 2013}}</ref>

In experimental studies, the appetite reducing effect of modafinil appears to be similar to that of [[substituted amphetamine]]s, but, unlike substituted amphetamines, the dose of modafinil that is effective at decreasing food intake does not significantly increase heart rate. Also, an article published in the ''Annals of Clinical Psychiatry'', presented the case of a 280-pound patient (BMI=35.52) who lost 40 pounds over the course of a year on modafinil (to 30.44 BMI). After three years, his weight stabilized at a 50-pound weight loss (29.59 BMI).

Modafinil has been studied as a possible treatment for [[delayed sleep phase syndrome]], which causes excessive daytime somnolence when the natural (delayed) diurnal rhythm is replaced by a socially determined earlier or forward shifted sleep schedule.<ref name="pmid20505660">{{cite journal | vauthors = Grady S, Aeschbach D, Wright KP, Czeisler CA | title = Effect of modafinil on impairments in neurobehavioral performance and learning associated with extended wakefulness and circadian misalignment | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 35 | issue = 9 | pages = 1910–20 | date = Aug 2010 | pmid = 20505660 | pmc = 2904872 | doi = 10.1038/npp.2010.63 }}</ref>

===Cognitive enhancement===

===Post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment===
Modafinil has been used [[off-label]] in trials with people with symptoms of [[post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment]], also known as "chemobrain", but in 2011 it was found to be no better than placebo.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Portela MA, Rubiales AS, Centeno C | title = The use of psychostimulants in cancer patients | journal = Current Opinion in Supportive and Palliative Care | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 164–8 | date = Jun 2011 | pmid = 21532350 | doi = 10.1097/SPC.0b013e3283462ff3 }}</ref> As of 2015 it had been studied for use in multiple sclerosis associated fatigue, but the resulting evidence was weak and inconclusive.<ref name=Cochrane2015>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mücke M, Mochamat CH, Peuckmann-Post V, Minton O, Stone P, Radbruch L | title = Pharmacological treatments for fatigue associated with palliative care | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 30 | issue =5  | pages = CD006788 | year = 2015 | pmid = 26026155 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006788.pub3 }}</ref>

===Motion sickness===
Modafinil has been evaluated alone and in combination with [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]] as an anti-motion sickness medication. It did not help by itself, but appeared to help in combination with scopolamine, acting to reduce symptoms of drowsiness associated with scopolamine.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hoyt|first1=RE|last2=Lawson|first2=BD|last3=McGee|first3=HA|last4=Strompolis|first4=ML|last5=McClellan|first5=MA|title=Modafinil as a potential motion sickness countermeasure.|journal=Aviation, space, and environmental medicine|date=August 2009|volume=80|issue=8|pages=709–15|pmid=19653573|doi=10.3357/asem.2477.2009}}</ref>
