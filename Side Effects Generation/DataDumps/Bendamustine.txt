==Adverse effects==
Common adverse reactions are typical for the class of [[nitrogen mustard]]s, and include nausea, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, constipation, loss of appetite, cough, headache, unintentional weight loss, difficulty breathing, rashes, and [[stomatitis]], as well as immunosuppression, anemia, and [[thrombocytopenia|low platelet counts]].

===Warning===
Bendamustine solution is not compatible with Closed System Transfer Devices (CSTD)
Situation:
* FDA issued a warning on March 11, 2015 not to use bendamustine solution with CSTDs, adapters and syringes which contain either polycarbonate or acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) due to the incompatibility with N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA).
Background:
* PhaSealR & SpirosR CSTDs contain either polycarbonate or ABS can dissolve when coming into contact with bendamustine (which contains DMA).
Assessment:
* This can lead to device failure, possible product contamination, and potential serious adverse health consequences, including skin reactions in health care professionals preparing and administering this product and the risk of small blood vessel blockage in patients.
Recommendations:
* Immediately, stop using all PhaSealR &/or SpirosR products including adapters when preparing & administering bendamustine.
* Only use polypropylene syringes with bendamustine. These syringes are translucent in appearance.
* Continue to use all universal PPE & safety precautions for hazardous drugs when preparing & administering bendamustine.

==Pharmacology==

Bendamustine is a white, water-soluble microcrystalline powder with [[amphoterism|amphoteric]] properties. It acts as an alkylating agent causing intra-strand and inter-strand cross-links between [[DNA]] bases.

After intravenous infusion it is extensively metabolised in the [[liver]] by [[cytochrome p450]]. More than 95% of the drug is bound to protein – primarily [[albumin]]. Only free bendamustine is active. Elimination is biphasic with a half-life of 6–10 minutes and a terminal half-life of approximately 30 minutes. It is eliminated primarily through the [[kidney]]s.

==History==
Bendamustine was first synthesized in 1963 by Ozegowski and Krebs in [[East Germany]] (the former German Democratic Republic). Until 1990 it was available only in East Germany. East German investigators found that it was useful for treating [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]], [[Hodgkin’s disease]], [[non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma]], [[multiple myeloma]] and [[lung cancer]].

Bendamustine received its first marketing approval in Germany, where it is marketed under the tradename Ribomustin, by Astellas Pharma GmbH's licensee, Mundipharma International Corporation Limited. It is indicated as a single-agent or in combination with other anti-cancer agents for indolent [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]], multiple myeloma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. SymBio Pharmaceuticals Ltd. holds exclusive rights to develop and market bendamustine HCl in Japan and selected Asia Pacific Rim countries.

In March 2008, [[Cephalon]] received approval from the [[United States]] [[Food and Drug Administration]] to market bendamustine in the US, where it is sold under the tradename Treanda, for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cephalon.com/newsroom/news_reader.aspx?ID=1120688 |title=Cephalon press release – Cephalon Receives FDA Approval for TREANDA, a Novel Chemotherapy for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia |accessdate=2008-03-23 |format= |work= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421212459/http://www.cephalon.com/newsroom/news_reader.aspx?ID=1120688 |archivedate=2008-04-21 |df= }}</ref>

In October 2008, the FDA granted further approval to market Treanda for the treatment of indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that has progressed during or within six months of treatment with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cephalon.com/media/news-releases/article/video-cephalon-receives-fda-approval-for-treanda-to-treat-patients-with-relapsed-indolent-non-hodgk/ |title=Cephalon press release -Cephalon Receives FDA Approval for TREANDA to Treat Patients with Relapsed Indolent Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma |accessdate=2008-11-03 |format= |work= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207010837/http://www.cephalon.com/media/news-releases/article/video-cephalon-receives-fda-approval-for-treanda-to-treat-patients-with-relapsed-indolent-non-hodgk/ |archivedate=2008-12-07 |df= }}</ref>

==Research==
It is also being studied for the treatment of [[sarcoma]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bagchi S |title=Bendamustine for advanced sarcoma |journal=Lancet Oncol. |volume=8 |issue=8 |pages=674 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17726779 |doi= 10.1016/S1470-2045(07)70225-5|url=}}</ref> It is also being investigated in phase II trials for the non-cancer treatment of [[AL amyloidosis]].
