Caroverine [1-(diethylaminoethyl) -3 – (p-methoxybenzyl) – 1, 2 – hydroquinoxaline-2-one] is a quinoxaline derivative developed in the 1960s. Caroverine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor antagonist together with antioxidant activity, has been shown to protect the inner ear from excitotoxicity and to be effective in the treatment of tinnitus, sudden hearing loss and speech discrimination disorders in presbyacusis.

In recent years, it is on grounds of its quinoxline-dione structure, glutamate antagonism of him excitatory, afferent synapses of the cochlear inner hair cells and its neuroprotective properties that caroverine has been investigated as a new drug in the pharmacological treatment of tinnitus.

Caroverine also acts as a reversible glutamate antagonist in afferent cochlear synapse. Theoretical justification for the introduction of caroverine in the pharmacotherapy of tinnitus is that glutamate, as a key neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, is the most likely transmitter-substance in the afferent cochlear synapse (Ehrenberger-K eta al., 1992; Ehrenberger-K et al., 1995a; Ehrenberger-K et al., 1995b).

==Application==
Caroverine has been demonstrated to have a high rate of efficacy in the treatment of cochlear-synaptic tinnitus.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Caroverine in tinnitus treatment. A placebo-controlled blind study. |vauthors=Denk DM, Heinzl H, Franz P, Ehrenberger K |date=Nov 1997 |journal=Acta Oto-Laryngologica |PMID=9442821 |volume=117 |pages=825–30 |doi=10.3109/00016489709114208}}</ref>

Caroverine is available in Injection and Capsule form.
