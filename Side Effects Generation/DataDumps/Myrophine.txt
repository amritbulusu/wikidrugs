'''Myrophine''' ('''Myristylbenzylmorphine''') is an [[opiate]] analogue that was developed in 1952. It is a derivative of [[morphine]]. 

Myrophine is substituted with a 3-[[benzyl]] group and a 6-[[Myristic acid|myristyl]] chain. It is metabolised to form [[benzylmorphine]] and then further to morphine, and so is a long-acting [[prodrug]] for morphine, but with a slow onset of effects. It is weaker than morphine as an [[analgesic]] but longer-lasting in effects, and was thought to have more [[local anesthetic]] effect than morphine, though with a somewhat greater tendency to cause [[histamine]] reactions like itching and rash. In addiction studies conducted in human subjects in the 1950's, myrophine did not substitute for morphine in withdrawal, did not produce notable morphine-like effects, and did not produce addiction or dependence regardless of dose or how it was administered. Consequently, it was thought to be useful in treating pain in addicts who were being detoxified from other opioid drugs.<ref>[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/bulletin/1957/Vol17/Vol17-No4-5/bulletin_1957_17%284-5%29_569-863.pdf Eddy NB, Halbach H, Braenden OJ.

It is a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule I controlled substances|Schedule I]] drug in the USA, considered to have high potential for abuse and no medical applications, and is controlled under international drug conventions.  Myrophine is almost invariably used as the hydrochloride (free base conversion ratio 0.94) and has a DEA Administrative Controlled Substance Control Number of 9308.
Myrophine is a Class A controlled substance in the UK,<ref name='isomerdesign UK'>{{cite web | url = http://isomerdesign.com/Cdsa/scheduleUK.php?schedule=1§ion=10&structure=C#a1_10_800 | title = Part I Class A Drugs - IsomerDesign | accessdate = 2012-03-24 | date = 2012-03-03}}</ref> and is on the UN's [[Narcotic#INCB_Yellow_List|Yellow list]].
