'''Methoxyflurane''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]), formerly marketed as '''Penthrane''' by [[Abbott Laboratories]], is a [[halogenated ether]] that was in clinical use as a [[Inhalational anaesthetic|volatile inhalational anesthetic]] from its introduction by [[Joseph F. Artusio]] ''et al'' in 1960 until the late 1970s. It was first [[chemical synthesis|synthesized]] in the late 1940s by [[William T. Miller]] and his team of [[chemist]]s following their involvement in the [[Manhattan Project]].<ref name=Miller1948/>

Methoxyflurane is an extremely [[Potency (pharmacology)|potent]] and highly [[Lipophilicity|lipid-soluble]] anesthetic agent, characterized by very slow induction (onset of action) and emergence (offset or dissipation) times. It is [[Flammability|non-flammable]], has relatively mild [[Hemodynamics|hemodynamic]] effects, and it does not predispose the heart to [[cardiac dysrhythmia|rhythm disturbances]]. It is, however, a significant [[Hypoventilation|respiratory depressant]]. Methoxyflurane has powerful [[analgesic]] (pain-relieving) properties at well below full anesthetic doses. It was utilized in self-administration devices for [[obstetrics|obstetric]] analgesia, in a manner that foreshadowed the [[patient-controlled analgesia]] [[infusion pump]]s of today.

The [[biodegradation]] of methoxyflurane produces [[Inorganic compound|inorganic]] [[fluoride]] and [[dichloroacetic acid]] (DCAA). The combined effects of these two [[Chemical compound|compounds]] may be responsible for the [[toxicity]] of methoxyflurane to some of the major [[Human anatomy#Major organ systems|organs]] of the human body. Methoxyflurane was determined to be [[Nephrotoxicity|nephrotoxic]] (damaging to the kidneys) in a dose-dependent response and [[hepatotoxicity|hepatotoxic]] (damaging to the liver) at anesthetic doses in 1973, and the drug was abandoned as a [[General anaesthetic|general anesthetic]] in the late 1970s.<ref name="Mazze, Richard I. M pp 843">{{cite journal | author = Mazze Richard I | year = 2006 | title = Methoxyflurane Revisited: Tale of an Anesthetic from Cradle to Grave | url = | journal = Anesthesiology | volume = 105 | issue = 4| pages = 843–846 | doi=10.1097/00000542-200610000-00031}}</ref> In 1999, the manufacturer discontinued distribution of methoxyflurane in the United States and Canada, and on September 6, 2005, the Food and Drug Administration determined that it should be withdrawn from the market for safety concerns.<ref name="Mazze, Richard I. M pp 843"/> It is however still used in Australia as an emergency analgesic for the initial management of pain due to acute [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]], as well as for brief painful procedures such as changing of [[Dressing (medical)|wound dressings]] or for [[Casualty movement|transport of injured people]].

==Medical use==
Methoxyflurane has been extensively used since the 1970s in Australia as an emergency analgesic for short-term use, mostly by the [[Australian Defence Force|Australian]] and [[New Zealand Defence Force|New Zealand]] Defence Forces,<ref name=McLennan2007/> and the [[Emergency medical services in Australia|Australian ambulance services]].<ref name=Babl2006/><ref name=Buntine2007/><ref name=Johnston2011/> The drug is currently only available from one manufacturer (Medical Developments International, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia). It is self-administered to children and adults using the [[Penthrox inhaler]], a hand-held inhaler device, known as "the green whistle".<ref name=McLennan2007/><ref name=Babl2006/><ref name=Babl2007/><ref name=Grindlay2009/> A non-[[opioid]] alternative to [[morphine]], it is also easier to use than [[nitrous oxide]].<ref name=RADAR2010/> As of 2010, methoxyflurane was listed under the [[Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme]] for the initial management of pain due to acute trauma, as well as for brief painful procedures such as changing of wound dressings or for patient transport.<ref name=RADAR2010/> A portable, disposable, single-use inhaler device (the Penthrox inhaler), along with a single 3&nbsp;milliliter brown glass vial of methoxyflurane is provided in doctor's kits that allows conscious hemodynamically stable patients (including children over the age of 5&nbsp;years) to self-administer the drug, under supervision.<ref name=RADAR2010/>

Each 3&nbsp;milliliter dose lasts approximately 30&nbsp;minutes.<ref name=Penthrox2009/> Pain relief begins after 6–8 breaths and continues for several minutes after stopping inhalation.<ref name=Wellness2010/> The maximum recommended dose is 6&nbsp;milliliters per day or 15&nbsp;milliliters per week because of the risk of cumulative dose-related nephrotoxicity, and it should not be used on consecutive days.<ref name=RADAR2010/> Despite the potential for renal impairment when used at anesthetic doses, no significant adverse effects have been reported in the literature when it is used at the lower doses (up to 6&nbsp;milliliters) used for producing analgesia and sedation.<ref name=Babl2006/><ref name=Grindlay2009/><ref name=Rossi2008/> Due to the risk of organ (especially renal) [[toxicity]], methoxyflurane is [[Contraindication|contraindicated]] in patients with pre-existing [[Nephropathy|kidney disease]] or [[diabetes mellitus]], and is not recommended to be administered in conjunction with tetracyclines or other potentially nephrotoxic or [[Enzyme inducer|enzyme-inducing]] drugs.<ref name=Grindlay2009/>

==Chemical and physical properties==
{{Further information|Organofluorine}}

[[File:Methoxyflurane-3D-vdW.png|thumb|left|alt=A apace-filling model, or three-dimensional structure of the methoxyflurane molecule, in red, yellow, green, black and white.|[[Space-filling model]] (three-dimensional molecular structure) of methoxyflurane]]

With a [[Chemical formula|molecular formula]] of C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>O and a [[Structural formula#Condensed formulas|condensed structural formula]] of CHCl<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>OCH<sub>3</sub>, the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) name for methoxyflurane is 2,2-dichloro-1,1-difluoro-1-methoxyethane. It is a halogenated [[ether]] in form of a clear, colorless [[liquid]], and its [[vapor]] has a strong fruity aroma. It is [[Miscibility|miscible]] with [[ethanol]], [[acetone]], [[chloroform]], [[diethyl ether]], and fixed [[oil]]s. It is soluble in [[Natural rubber|rubber]].<ref name=Penthrox2009/>

With a [[minimum alveolar concentration]] (MAC) of 0.16%,<ref name=Mazze1971/> methoxyflurane is an extremely potent anesthetic agent. It is a powerful analgesic agent at well below full anesthetic concentrations.<ref name=Babl2007/><ref name=Torda1963/><ref name=Tomlin1973/><ref name=Tomi1993/><ref name=Crankshaw2005/> Because of its low volatility and very high [[boiling point]] (104.8&nbsp;°C at 1&nbsp;atmosphere), methoxyflurane has a low [[vapor pressure]] at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure]]. It is therefore quite difficult to vaporize methoxyflurane using conventional [[Anaesthetic vaporiser|anesthetic vaporizers]].

The carbon–fluorine bond, a component of all organofluorine compounds, is the strongest [[chemical bond]] in organic chemistry.<ref name=Hagan2008/> Furthermore, this bond becomes shorter and stronger as more fluorine atoms are added to the same carbon on a given molecule. Because of this, [[fluorocarbon|fluoroalkanes]] are some of the most [[Chemical stability|chemically stable]] organic compounds.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Methoxyflurane has a very high lipid solubility (oil:gas [[partition coefficient]] of around 950), which gives it very slow [[pharmacokinetics]] (induction and emergence characteristics); this being undesirable for routine application in the clinical setting. Initial studies performed in 1961 revealed that in [[General anaesthesia#Premedication|unpremedicated]] healthy individuals, induction of general anesthesia with methoxyflurane-[[oxygen]] alone or with nitrous oxide was difficult or even impossible using the vaporizers available at that time. It was found to be necessary to administer an [[General anaesthetic#Injection|intravenous anesthetic agent]] such as [[sodium thiopental]] to ensure a smooth and rapid induction. It was further found that after thiopental induction, it was necessary to administer nitrous oxide for at least ten minutes before a sufficient amount of methoxyflurane could accumulate in the [[Circulatory system|bloodstream]] to ensure an adequate level of anesthesia. This was despite using high flow (liters/minute) of nitrous oxide and oxygen, and with the vaporizers delivering the maximum possible concentration of methoxyflurane.<ref name=Wyant1961/>

Similar to its induction pharmacokinetics, methoxyflurane has very slow and somewhat unpredictable emergence characteristics. During initial clinical studies in 1961, the average time to emergence after discontinuation of methoxyflurane was 59&nbsp;minutes after administration of methoxyflurane for an average duration of 87&nbsp;minutes. The longest time to emergence was 285&nbsp;minutes, after 165&nbsp;minutes of methoxyflurane administration.<ref name=Wyant1961/>

==Pharmacodynamics==
;Cardiovascular effects
The effects of methoxyflurane on the circulatory system resemble those of diethyl ether.<ref name=Siebecker1961/> In dogs, methoxyflurane anesthesia causes a moderate [[hypotension|decrease in blood pressure]] with minimal changes in [[heart rate]], and no significant effect on [[blood sugar]], [[epinephrine]], or [[norepinephrine]]. [[Bleeding]] and increased [[arterial blood gas|arterial]] [[partial pressure]] of [[carbon dioxide]] (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) both induce further decreases in blood pressure, as well as increases in blood glucose, epinephrine and norepinephrine.<ref name=Millar1961/> In humans, methoxyflurane produces some decrease in blood pressure, but [[cardiac output]], [[stroke volume]], and [[total peripheral resistance]] are only minimally depressed. Its effect on the [[pulmonary circulation]] is negligible, and it does not predispose the heart to [[cardiac dysrhythmia]]s.<ref name=Wyant1961/><ref name=Artusio1960/><ref name=VANPOZNAK1960-1/><ref name=VANPOZNAK1960-2/>

;Respiratory effects
Unlike diethyl ether, methoxyflurane is a significant respiratory depressant. In dogs, methoxyflurane causes a [[Dose-response relationship|dose-dependent]] decrease in [[respiratory rate]] and a marked decrease in [[respiratory minute volume]], with a relatively mild decrease in [[tidal volume]]. In humans, methoxyflurane causes a dose-dependent decrease in tidal volume and minute volume, with respiratory rate relatively constant.<ref name=Siebecker1961/> The net effect of these changes is profound respiratory depression, as evidenced by [[hypercapnia|CO<sub>2</sub> retention]] with a concomitant decrease in arterial [[pH]] (this is referred to as a [[respiratory acidosis]]) when anesthetized subjects are allowed to breathe spontaneously for any length of time.<ref name=Wyant1961/>

;Gastrointestinal effects
In a series of 500 consecutive obstetric [[patient]]s, Boisvert and Hudon observed vomiting in 12 (4.8%) patients during or after administration of methoxyflurane anesthesia. These findings compared favorably with those reported for [[cyclopropane]] (42%), [[trichloroethylene]] (28%) and halothane (4.6%).<ref name=Boisvert1962/> In another study of 645 obstetric patients, Romagnoli and Korman observed 8 cases (1.2%) of [[Postoperative nausea and vomiting|postoperative vomiting]], one of whom was [[retching]] before the administration of the anesthetic.<ref name=Romagnoli1962/>

;Analgesic effects
Although the high blood solubility of methoxyflurane is often undesirable, this property makes it useful in certain situations—it persists in the [[Compartment (pharmacokinetics)|lipid compartment]] of the body for a long time, providing [[sedation]] and analgesia well into the postoperative period.<ref name=Crankshaw2005/><ref name=Siebecker1961/> There is substantial data to indicate that methoxyflurane is an effective analgesic and sedative agent at subanesthetic doses.<ref name=McLennan2007/><ref name=Babl2006/><ref name=Buntine2007/><ref name=Johnston2011/><ref name=Major1966/><ref name=Dragon1967/><ref name=Packer1969/><ref name=Romagnoli1970/><ref name=Firn1972/><ref name=Josephson1974/><ref name=Lewis1984/><ref name=Komesaroff1995/><ref name=Chin2002/> Supervised [[self-administration]] of methoxyflurane in children and adults can briefly lead to deep sedation,<ref name=Babl2006/> and it has been used as a patient controlled analgesic for painful procedures in children in hospital [[emergency department]]s.<ref name=Babl2007/> During [[childbirth]], administration of methoxyflurane produces significantly better analgesia, less [[psychomotor agitation]], and only slightly more [[somnolence]] than trichloroethylene.<ref name=Major1966/>

In 1968, Robert Wexler of Abbott Laboratories developed the Analgizer, a disposable [[inhaler]] that allowed the self-administration of methoxyflurane vapor in air for analgesia.<ref name=Wexler1968/> The Analgizer consisted of a [[polyethylene]] cylinder 5&nbsp;inches long and 1&nbsp;inch in diameter with a 1&nbsp;inch long mouthpiece. The device contained a rolled [[Candle wick|wick]] of [[polypropylene]] [[felt]] which held 15&nbsp;[[Litre#SI prefixes applied to the litre|milliliters]] of methoxyflurane. Because of the simplicity of the Analgizer and the [[Pharmacology|pharmacological]] characteristics of methoxyflurane, it was easy for patients to self-administer the drug and rapidly achieve a level of [[Procedural sedation and analgesia|conscious analgesia]] which could be maintained and adjusted as necessary over a period of time lasting from a few minutes to several hours. The 15&nbsp;milliliter supply of methoxyflurane would typically last for two to three hours, during which time the user would often be partly [[Amnesia|amnesic]] to the sense of pain; the device could be refilled if necessary.<ref name=Romagnoli1970/> The Analgizer was found to be safe, effective, and simple to administer in obstetric patients during childbirth, as well as for patients with [[bone fracture]]s and [[joint dislocation]]s,<ref name=Romagnoli1970/> and for dressing changes on [[burn]] patients.<ref name=Packer1969/> When used for labor analgesia, the Analgizer allows labor to progress normally and with no apparent [[adverse effect]] on [[Apgar score]]s.<ref name=Romagnoli1970/> All [[vital signs]] remain normal in obstetric patients, newborns, and injured patients.<ref name=Romagnoli1970/> The Analgizer was widely utilized for analgesia and sedation until the early 1970s, in a manner that foreshadowed the patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps of today.<ref name=Major1966/><ref name=Dragon1967/><ref name=Firn1972/><ref name=Josephson1974/> The Analgizer inhaler was withdrawn in 1974, but use of methoxyflurane as a sedative and analgesic continues in Australia and New Zealand in the form of the [[Penthrox inhaler]].<ref name=McLennan2007/><ref name=Babl2006/><ref name=Babl2007/><ref name=Grindlay2009/> Trials of methoxyflurane as an analgesic in emergency medicine are going on in the UK.

==Biodegradation and toxicity==
{{Further information|Drug metabolism|Fluoride poisoning}}

The first report of nephrotoxicity appeared in 1964, when Paddock and colleagues reported three cases of acute renal insufficiency, two of whom were found to have calcium [[oxalate]] crystals in the renal tubules at autopsy.<ref name=Paddock1964/> In 1966, Crandell and colleagues reported a series in which 17/95 (18%) of patients developed an unusual type of [[nephropathy]] after operations in which methoxyflurane was used as a general anesthetic. This particular type of [[renal insufficiency]] was characterized by [[vasopressin]]-resistant [[Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus|high-output renal failure]] (production of large volumes of poorly concentrated urine) with a negative fluid balance, pronounced weight loss, elevation of serum sodium, chloride, [[osmolality]] and blood urea nitrogen. The urine of these patients was of a relatively fixed [[specific gravity]] and an osmolality very similar to that of the serum. Furthermore, the high urine output persisted a challenge test of fluid deprivation. Most cases resolved within 2–3 weeks, but evidence of renal dysfunction persisted for more than one year in 3 of these 17 cases (18%), and more than two years in one case (6%).<ref name=Crandell1966/>

Reports of severe and even fatal hepatotoxicity related to the use of methoxyflurane began to appear in 1966.<ref name=Klein1966/><ref name=Lischner1967/><ref name=Stefanini1970/><ref name=Brenner1971/><ref name=Joshi1974/><ref name=Rubinger1975/><ref name=Min1977/><ref name=Delia1983/><ref name=Okuno1985/> These reports prompted anesthesiologists to subject this agent to intense and systematic scrutiny. A study published in 1973 by Cousins and Mazze demonstrated that compared with halothane, methoxyflurane produces dose-dependent and deleterious abnormalities in [[renal function]]. The authors showed that [[Asymptomatic|subclinical]] nephrotoxicity occurred following methoxyflurane at minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) for 2.5 to 3&nbsp;hours (2.5 to 3&nbsp;MAC hours), while overt toxicity was present in all patients at dosages greater than five MAC hours.<ref name=Cousins1973/> This landmark study provided a model that would be used for the assessment of the nephrotoxicity of volatile anesthetics for the next two decades.<ref name=Barash2009-17/>

The biodegradation of methoxyflurane begins immediately after the onset of exposure. The [[nephrotoxicity|kidney]] and [[hepatotoxicity|liver]] toxicity observed after anesthetic doses is attributable to one or more [[metabolite]]s produced by O-[[demethylation]] of methoxyflurane. Significant products of this [[catabolism|catabolic process]] include methoxyfluoroacetic acid (MFAA), dichloroacetic acid (DCAA), and inorganic fluoride.<ref name=Gottlieb1974/> Methoxyflurane nephrotoxicity is dose dependent<ref name=Crandell1966/><ref name=Jones1972/><ref name=Mazze1976/> and irreversible, resulting from O-demethylation of methoxyflurane to fluoride and DCAA.<ref name=RADAR2010/> This effect is so predictable and reproducible that methoxyflurane now serves as a pharmacologic model of fluoride-related nephrotoxicity, one with which newer drugs are compared.<ref name=Barash2009-17/> It is not entirely clear whether the fluoride itself is toxic—it may simply be a [[Surrogate endpoint|surrogate measure]] for some other [[Toxication|toxic metabolite]].<ref name=Kharasch2006-1/> The concurrent formation of inorganic fluoride and DCAA is unique to methoxyflurane [[biotransformation]] compared with other volatile anesthetics, and this combination is more toxic than fluoride alone. This may explain why fluoride formation from methoxyflurane is associated with nephrotoxicity, while fluoride formation from other volatile anesthetics (such as [[enflurane]] and [[sevoflurane]]) is not.<ref name=Kharasch2006-2/> Furthermore, the concurrent use of [[tetracycline]]s and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.<ref name=Helsinn/>

Based on the findings of these and other studies in the early 1970s, the current consensus is that the use of methoxyflurane should be restricted only to healthy individuals, in situations where it offers specific advantages and even then, only at dosages less than 2.5&nbsp;MAC hours.<ref name=Cousins1973/><ref name=Gottlieb1974/> Partly because of these warnings, but also because of the development of newer volatile anesthetics such as enflurane, [[isoflurane]], [[desflurane]] and sevoflurane, the clinical use of methoxyflurane as a general anesthetic in humans was largely abandoned in the mid-1970s.

The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] maintains a [[recommended exposure limit]] for methoxyflurane as waste anesthetic gas of 2 ppm (13.5&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup>) over 60 minutes.<ref>{{Cite web|title = CDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards - Methoxyflurane|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0389.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}</ref>

==History==
All of the currently used volatile anesthetic agents are organofluorine compounds. Aside from the [[Thomas Midgley, Jr.#Synthesis of Freon|synthesis of Freon]] ([[Thomas Midgley, Jr.]] and [[Charles F. Kettering]], 1928)<ref name=Sneader2005/> and the discovery of [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] ([[Roy J. Plunkett]], 1938),<ref name=Dupont2010/> the field of [[organofluorine chemistry]] had not attracted a great deal of attention up to 1940 because of the extreme reactivity of elemental [[fluorine]], which had to be produced ''in situ'' for use in chemical reactions. The development of organofluorine chemistry was a [[government spin-off|spin-off]] from the [[Manhattan Project]], during which elemental fluorine was produced on an industrial scale for the first time.

The need for fluorine arose from the need to separate the [[Isotopes of uranium|isotope]]<sup>235</sup>U from <sup>238</sup>U because the former, present in natural [[uranium]] at a concentration of less than 1% is [[fissile]] (capable of sustaining a [[Chain reaction#Nuclear chain reactions|nuclear chain reaction]] of [[nuclear fission]] with [[Neutron temperature#Thermal neutrons|thermal neutrons]]),<ref name=Cotton2006/> whereas the latter is not. Members of the [[MAUD Committee]] (especially [[Francis Simon]] and [[Nicholas Kurti]]) proposed the use of [[gaseous diffusion]] for isotope separation, since, according to [[Graham's law]] the rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to molecular mass.<ref name=Rhodes1986/> After an extensive search, [[uranium hexafluoride]], UF<sub>6</sub>, was determined to be the most suitable compound of uranium to be used for the gaseous diffusion process.<ref name=Beaton1962/> Elemental fluorine is needed in the production of UF<sub>6</sub>.

Significant obstacles had to be overcome in the handling of both fluorine and UF<sub>6</sub>. Before the [[K-25]] gaseous diffusion [[chemical plant|plant]] could be built, it was first necessary to develop [[Reactivity (chemistry)|non-reactive]] [[chemical compound]]s that could be used as [[coating]]s, lubricants and gaskets for the surfaces which would come into contact with the UF<sub>6</sub> gas (a highly reactive and [[corrosive substance]]). William T. Miller,<ref name=obituary/> professor of [[organic chemistry]] at [[Cornell University]], was co-opted to develop such materials, because of his expertise in organofluorine chemistry. Miller and his team developed several novel non-reactive [[chlorofluorocarbon]] [[polymer]]s that were used in this application.

[[Charles Suckling]] synthesized [[halothane]] in 1951. Halothane was the first organofluorine anesthetic agent to be introduced into clinical practice in 1956.<ref name=Raventos1956/> Miller and his team continued to develop organofluorine chemistry after the end of World War II and methoxyflurane was synthesized in 1948.<ref name=Miller1948/>
