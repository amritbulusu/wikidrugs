'''2,5-Dimethoxy-4-chloroamphetamine''' ('''DOC''') is a [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] [[drug]] of the [[substituted phenethylamine|phenethylamine]] and [[substituted amphetamine|amphetamine]] [[chemical class]]es. It was presumably first [[Organic synthesis|synthesized]] by [[Alexander Shulgin]], and was described in his book ''[[PiHKAL]]'' (''Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved'').<ref name="PiHKAL">{{cite book | title = PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story | last = Shulgin | first = Alexander |author2= Shulgin, Ann   | publisher = Transform Press | location = United States | isbn = 0-9630096-0-5 | page = 978 | url = http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal.shtml| accessdate= 30 November 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100103030739/http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal.shtml| archivedate= 3 January 2010| deadurl= no |date= September 1991}}</ref>

== Chemistry ==

DOC is a [[substituent|substituted]] [[alpha carbon|alpha]]-[[methyl]]ated [[phenethylamine]], a class of compounds commonly known as [[amphetamine]]s. The phenethylamine equivalent (lacking the alpha-methyl group) is [[2C-C]]. DOC has a [[stereocenter]] and (''R'')-(−)-DOC is the more active [[stereoisomer]].

== Pharmacology ==

DOC acts as a selective [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]], [[5-HT2B receptor|5-HT<sub>2B</sub>]], and [[5-HT2C receptor|5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor]] [[partial agonist]]. Its psychedelic effects are mediated via its actions on the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

== Dosage ==

A normal average dose of DOC ranges from 0.5–7.0 [[Milligram|mg]]<ref name="urlErowid DOC Vault : Dosage">{{cite web|url=http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/doc/doc_dose.shtml |title=Erowid DOC Vault : Dosage |work= |accessdate=22 April 2008 <!--DASHBot--> |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502003536/http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/doc/doc_dose.shtml |archivedate=2 May 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref> the former producing threshold effects, and the latter producing extremely strong effects. Onset of the drug is 1–3 hours, peak and plateau at 4–8 hours, and a gradual come down with residual stimulation at 9-20h. After effects can last well into the next day. <ref name="urlErowid DOC Vault : Dosage"/><ref name="urlErowid Online Books : PiHKAL - #64 DOC">{{cite web |url=http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal064.shtml |title=Erowid Online Books : "PiHKAL" - #64 DOC |work= | accessdate= 17 November 2005 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>

== Effects ==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
Unlike simple amphetamines, DOC is considered a chemical that influences cognitive and perception processes of the brain. The strongest supposed effects include open and [[Closed eye hallucinations|closed eye visuals]], increased awareness of sound and movement, and euphoria. In the autobiography PiHKAL, Alexander Shulgin included a description of DOC as "an [[archetypal]] [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelic]]" (#64); its presumed full-range visual, audio, physical, and mental effects show exhilarating clarity, and some overwhelming, humbling, and "composting"/interweaving effects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal064.shtml|title=Erowid Online Books : "PIHKAL" - #64 DOC|website=www.erowid.org|access-date=2016-03-04}}</ref>

== Dangers ==

Very little data exists about the toxicity of DOC. In April 2013, a case of death due to DOC was reported. The source does not specify whether the drug alone caused the death.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bucks|first=Jonathan|title="Moment of madness": rare drug implicated in student death|url=http://www.thesaint-online.com/2013/04/moment-of-madness-rare-drug-implicated-in-student-death/|accessdate=25 April 2013|newspaper=The Saint|date=25 April 2013}}</ref> In 2014, a death was reported in which DOC was directly implicated as the sole causative agent in the death of a user. The autopsy indicated [[pulmonary edema]] and a [[subgaleal hemorrhage]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barnett|first=Rachel Y.|last2=Baker|first2=Daniel D.|last3=Kelly|first3=Nancy E.|last4=McGuire|first4=Calvin E.|last5=Fassette|first5=Timothy C.|last6=Gorniak|first6=Jan M.|date=2014-10-01|title=A Fatal Intoxication of 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-Chloroamphetamine: A Case Report|url=http://jat.oxfordjournals.org/content/38/8/589|journal=Journal of Analytical Toxicology|language=en|volume=38|issue=8|pages=589–591|doi=10.1093/jat/bku087|issn=0146-4760|pmid=25217551}}</ref>

== Detection in biological specimens ==
DOC may be quantitated in blood, plasma or urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma DOC concentrations are expected to be in a range of 1–10 μg/L in persons using the drug recreationally, >20 μg/L in intoxicated patients and >100 μg/L in victims of acute overdosage.<ref>{{cite book  | author = Baselt RC  | title = Disposition of toxic drugs and chemicals in man | year = 2014 | publisher = Biomedical Publications | location = Seal Beach, Ca. | isbn = 978-0-9626523-9-4 | page = 2173 }}</ref>

== Popularity ==

Although rare on the [[black market]], it has been available in bulk and shipped worldwide by select elite "Grey Market" Research Chemical suppliers for several years. Sales of DOC on [[blotting paper]] and in capsules was reported in late 2005 and again in late 2007. According to the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] [ December Microgram], the Concord Police Department in Contra Costa County, California, in the US, seized "a small piece of crudely lined white blotter paper without any design, suspected [[LSD]] 'blotter acid'". They added "Unusually, the paper appeared to be hand-lined using two pens, in squares measuring approximately 6 x 6 millimeters. The paper displayed fluorescence when irradiated at 365 nanometers; however, color testing for LSD with [[para-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde]] ([[ehrlich's reagent]]) was negative. Analysis of a methanol extract by GC/MS indicated not LSD but rather DOC (not quantitated but a high loading based on the TIC)".<ref>http://www.justice.gov/dea/pr/micrograms/2007/mg1207.pdf</ref> DOC is sometimes misrepresented as LSD by unscrupulous dealers. This is particularly dangerous, as DOC is not known to have the safety profile of LSD. It can be particularly unsafe, in comparison to LSD, for those suffering from hypertension, as amphetamine compounds are known to cause sharp increases in systolic blood pressure.
