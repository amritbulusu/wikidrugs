'''Cromoglicic acid''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) (also referred to as '''cromolyn''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]), '''cromoglycate''' (former [[British Approved Name|BAN]]), or '''cromoglicate''') is traditionally described as a [[mast cell stabilizer]], and is commonly marketed as the sodium salt '''sodium cromoglicate''' or '''cromolyn sodium'''.  This drug prevents the release of [[inflammation|inflammatory]] chemicals such as [[histamine]] from [[mast cell]]s.

Because of their convenience (and perceived safety), [[leukotriene antagonist|leukotriene receptor antagonist]]s have largely replaced it as the non-[[corticosteroid]] treatment of choice in the treatment of [[asthma]]. Cromoglicic acid requires administration four times daily, and does not provide additive benefit in combination with inhaled corticosteroids.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fanta CH |title=Asthma |journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume=360 |issue=10 |pages=1002–14 |date=March 2009 |pmid=19264689 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra0804579}} Review.</ref>

==History==
Cromolyn sodium was discovered by [[Roger Altounyan]] who was himself a lifelong asthma sufferer. It is considered a breakthrough drug in management of asthma, as the patients can be freed from steroids in many cases; however, it is mainly effective as a prophylaxis for allergic and exercise-induced asthma, not as a treatment for acute attacks.  Altounyan was investigating certain plants and herbs which have bronchodilating properties. One such plant was [[khella]] (''Ammi visnaga'') which had been used as a muscle relaxant since ancient times in Egypt. Altounyan deliberately inhaled derivatives of the active ingredient [[khellin]] to determine if they could block his asthma attacks. After several years of trial he isolated an effective and safe asthma-preventing compound called cromolyn sodium.

==Preparations==
Cromoglicic acid is available in multiple forms:

* as a [[nasal spray]] (Rynacrom(UK), Lomusol(France), Nasalcrom(US) ) to treat [[allergic rhinitis]].
* in a nebulizer solution for aerosol administration to treat [[asthma]].
* as an [[inhaler]] (Intal) for preventive management of [[asthma]].<ref name="pmid8635375">{{cite journal |vauthors=Schwartz HJ, Blumenthal M, Brady R |title=A comparative study of the clinical efficacy of nedocromil sodium and placebo.

Another oral product, Intercron (sodium cromoglicate in distilled water, from [[Zambon]] France), is used for food allergies.

==Mechanism of action==
"Cromolyn works because it prevents the release of mediators that would normally attract inflammatory cells and because it stabilizes the inflammatory cells. MCT mast cells found in the mucosa are stabilised."<ref>Werner's Pathophysiology page 224</ref>  [[Nedocromil]] is another mast cell stabilizer that also works in controlling asthma.
The underlying [[mechanism of action]] is not fully understood; for while cromoglicate stabilizes mast cells, this mechanism is probably not why it works in asthma.<ref name="rang">H. P. Rang et al., ''Pharmacology'', Fifth Edition. (2003) {{ISBN|0-443-07145-4}}</ref>  Pharmaceutical companies have produced 20 related compounds that are equally or more potent at stabilising mast cells and none of them have shown any anti-asthmatic effect.<ref name="rang"/> It is more likely that these work by inhibiting the response of sensory [[C fibers]] to the irritant [[capsaicin]], inhibiting local axon reflexes involved in asthma, and may inhibit the release of preformed T cell cytokines and mediators involved in asthma. (see review by Garland, 1991)

It is known to somewhat inhibit [[chloride channels]] (37% ± 7%)<ref>{{cite journal

 }}</ref> and thus ''may'' inhibit the:
* exaggerated neuronal reflexes triggered by stimulation of irritant receptors on sensory nerve endings (e.g. exercise-induced asthma)
* release of preformed [[cytokines]] from several type of inflammatory cells ([[T cell]]s, [[Eosinophil granulocyte|eosinophils]]) in allergen-induced asthma

Note: Another chemical (NPPB: 5-nitro-2(3-phenyl) propylamino-benzoic acid) was shown, in the same study, to be a more effective chloride channel blocker.

Finally it may act by inhibiting calcium influx.<!-- see DrugBank link above-->

Cromoglicate is classified as a [[chromone]].
