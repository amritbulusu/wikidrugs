'''Medrogestone''', sold under the brand name '''Colprone''' among others, is a [[progestin]] that has been used in [[hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] for [[menopause|menopausal]] [[symptom]]s and in the treatment of [[gynecological disorder]]s.<ref name="Elks2014">{{cite book| first = J. | last = Elks | name-list-format = vanc | title = The Dictionary of Drugs: Chemical Data: Chemical Data, Structures and Bibliographies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0vXTBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA760|date=14 November 2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4757-2085-3|pages=759–760}}</ref><ref name="IndexNominum2000">{{cite book | author =  Swiss Pharmaceutical Society | title = Index Nominum 2000: International Drug Directory | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5GpcTQD_L2oC&pg=PA638 | date = January 2000|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-3-88763-075-1|pages=638–}}</ref><ref name="MortonMorton1999">{{cite book | first1= Ian | last1 = Morton | first2 = I.K. | last2 = Morton | first3 = Judith M. | last3 = Hall | name-list-format = vanc | title = Concise Dictionary of Pharmacological Agents: Properties and Synonyms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mqaOMOtk61IC&pg=PA173|date=31 October 1999|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-0-7514-0499-9|pages=173–}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
In the past, medrogestone was used in the treatment of [[endometrial cancer]] and in some regimens for [[breast cancer]], and, in men, for [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]]. It still finds use in the treatment of [[amenorrhea]]<ref>{{MeSH name|Medrogestone}}</ref> and as the progestin component in certain forms of [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|menopausal hormone replacement therapy]].<ref name="Martindale" />

===Breast disorders===
Cyclic treatment with low-dose (10&nbsp;mg/day) medrogestone has been found to be effective in the treatment of [[fibrocystic breast changes]] and associated [[mastodynia]] (breast pain).<ref name="pmid12227885">{{cite journal | vauthors = Winkler UH, Schindler AE, Brinkmann US, Ebert C, Oberhoff C | title = Cyclic progestin therapy for the management of mastopathy and mastodynia | journal = Gynecol.

==Contraindications==
[[Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy]] (acute or in history), [[vaginal bleeding]] of unknown origin, and severe diseases of the [[liver]] such as [[tumor]]s are absolute contraindications for medrogestone, as are [[thrombotic]] events such as [[thrombophlebitis]] or [[stroke]].<ref name="Austria-Codex" /> Relative contraindications include a history of [[jaundice]] or [[itch]]ing in pregnancy or [[gestational pemphigoid]].{{mcn|date=July 2015}}

===Pregnancy and lactation===
Medrogestone is [[contraindication|contraindicated]] during [[pregnancy]] because progestogens are associated with risks for the [[fetus]] in animals and humans.<ref name="ODDB" /> Studies in pregnant rabbits have shown [[skeletal]] deformations under 3&nbsp;mg/kg medrogestone but not under 1&nbsp;mg/kg.{{mcn|date=July 2015}} Typical therapeutic doses of the drug are between 0.1 and 0.25&nbsp;mg/kg.

It is not known whether medrogestone passes into [[breast milk]], but it is to be expected given its [[lipophilicity]] and studies with structurally related progestins.<ref name="ODDB" />

==Side effects==
Medrogestone seldom produces [[side effect]]s, all of which are typical of progestogens. They include [[nausea]], [[depression (mood)|depression]],<ref name="Austria-Codex" /> [[anorexia (symptom)|decreased appetite]], [[headache]], and [[dizziness]].{{mcn|date=July 2015}}

==Overdose==
The [[acute toxicity]] of the drug is low. [[Overdose]] causes only harmless side effects such as nausea and [[vaginal bleeding]].<ref name="ODDB" /> The {{LD50}} has been found to range between 500&nbsp;mg/kg in dogs and over 3000&nbsp;mg/kg in rats. [[Chronic toxicity]] has been examined in animals, but nothing but the typical adverse effects of progestogens, and reduction of [[prostate gland|prostatic]] weight in [[rhesus monkey]]s, have been found. Accidental intake of the drug, including in children, is normally not dangerous. Intake of extremely large doses, or intake by patients with [[epilepsy]] or [[renal impairment|impaired kidney function]], can result in central nervous [[cramp]]ing.<ref name="Austria-Codex" />

==Interactions==
[[Enzyme inducer]]s such as [[barbiturate]]s, [[phenylbutazone]], [[phenytoin]], [[ampicillin]] or [[tetracyclines]] are expected to reduce plasma concentrations of medrogestone, but no systematic research has been done.<ref name="ODDB" />

==Pharmacology==
Medrogestone is described as a pure [[progestogen]] similar in profile to [[progesterone]].<ref name="ReveszChappel1966" /><ref name="Allahbadia2016">{{cite book|author=Gautam Allahbadia|title=Manual of Ovulation Induction & Ovarian Stimulation Protocols|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S8GfCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA94|date=29 February 2016|publisher=JP Medical Ltd|isbn=978-93-5090-958-4|pages=94–|quote=The natural preparations of P4 include progesterone, dydrogesterone, and medrogestone.}}</ref> In contrast to progesterone however, medrogestone is more potent and is orally active.<ref name="ReveszChappel1966" /> There is reportedly no information available on the [[affinity (pharmacology)|receptor binding]] of medrogestone at the various [[steroid hormone receptor]]s.<ref name="Kuhl2009" /> However, based on [[animal research]] (e.g., the [[Carl Clauberg#Clauberg test|Clauberg test]] and other [[bioassay|assay]]s), medrogestone appears to be a potent progestogen, devoid of [[androgenic]], [[estrogenic]], and [[glucocorticoid]] activity, but with weak [[antiandrogen]] and very weak [[antimineralocorticoid]] activity.<ref name="ReveszChappel1966" /> Accordingly, no evidence of androgenic or glucocorticoid activity, including effects on the estrogen-induced increase in [[triglycerides]] and [[HDL cholesterol]] and [[adrenal suppression]], were observed in clinical studies.<ref name="Kuhl2009" /><ref name="pmid14176912">{{cite journal| title = Evaluation of a new progestational agent, 6, 17α-dimethyl-6-dehydroprogesterone | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 89 | issue = 5| pages = 635–41 | year = 1964 | pmid = 14176912 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9378(64)90158-9 | url = | author1 = Carter | first1 = W.

Medrogestone, also known as '''6,17α-dimethyl-6-dehydroprogesterone''' or as '''6,17α-dimethyl-4,6-pregnadiene-3,20-dione''', is a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]] [[pregnane]] [[steroid]] and a [[chemical derivative|derivative]] of [[progesterone]]. It is structurally related to the [[17α-hydroxyprogesterone]] derivatives [[megestrol acetate]] and [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]].<ref name="SchindlerCampagnoli2003" /><ref name="Kuhl2009" /> Medrogestone itself is not a 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivative and is instead a derivative of [[17α-methylprogesterone]].<ref name="SchindlerCampagnoli2003" /><ref name="Kuhl2009" /> This is because it features a [[methyl group]] at the C17α position instead of a [[hydroxy group|hydroxy]] or [[acetoxy group]].<ref name="SchindlerCampagnoli2003" /><ref name="Kuhl2009" /> In addition to its C17α methyl group, medrogestone possesses a methyl group at the C6 position and a [[double bond]] between the C6 and C7 positions.<ref name="SchindlerCampagnoli2003" /> The only structural difference between medrogestone and megestrol acetate is the replacement of the C17α acetoxy group with a methyl group.<ref name="Elks2014" /><ref name="IndexNominum2000" /><ref name="Drugs.com" />

===Synthesis===
The oral activity of 17α-methylprogesterone has already been alluded to. This compound, which may well owe this property to the inhibition of metabolism in a manner analogous to synthetic androgens and estrogens, is not sufficiently potent in its own right to constitute a useful drug. Incorporation of known potentiating modifications yields the commercially available oral progestin medrogestone ('''4''').

The preparation of the 6-methyl-16-dehydropregnenolone acetate ('''1''') precursor is covered [[melengestrol acetate|here]].

[[File:Medrogestone synthesis.svg|thumb|center|700px|Medrogestone synthesis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Deghenghi R, Revesz C, Gaudry R | title = New Synthesis and Structure Activity Relationship in the 17-Alkylated Progesterone Series | journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 301–4 | date = May 1963 | pmid = 14185989 | doi = 10.1021/jm00339a019 }}</ref>]]

Reduction of the conjugated 16,17 double bond of 6-methyl-16-dehydropregnenolone acetate by means of lithium in liquid ammonia leads initially to the 17 enolate ion,; this is alkylated in situ with methyl iodide. The now-familiar steric control asserts itself to afford the 17α-methyl compound,.

The acetate group is lost as a side reaction. In an interesting modification on the usual scheme, ('''3''') is treated with [[aluminum isopropoxide]] and a ketone (Oppenauer conditions) as well as [[chloranil]] in a single reaction; the 4,6-diene, (medrogesterone), is obtained directly from this step.

==History==
Medrogestone was developed in the 1960s and appears to have been marketed since at least 1966.<ref name="ReveszChappel1966">{{cite journal | vauthors = Revesz C, Chappel CI | title = Biological activity of medrogestone: a new orally active progestin | journal = Journal of Reproduction and Fertility | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 473–87 | date = December 1966 | pmid = 4288903 | doi = 10.1530/jrf.0.0120473 }}</ref>
