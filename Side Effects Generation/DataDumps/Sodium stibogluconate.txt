==Side effects==
Sodium stibogluconate is exceedingly toxic to [[veins]].  One of the practical problems is that after a few doses it can become exceedingly difficult to find a vein in which to inject the drug.  The insertion of a [[peripherally inserted central catheter|PICC]] does not prevent the problem and can instead exacerbate it: the entire vein along the course of the PICC line can become inflamed and [[thrombosis|thrombose]].  Large doses of sodium stibogluconate are often administered as dilute solutions.

[[Pancreatitis]] is a common deleterious effect of the drug, and the [[blood plasma|serum]] [[amylase]] or [[lipase]] should be monitored twice weekly; there is no need to stop treatment if the amylase remains less than four times the upper limit of normal; if the amylase rises above the cut-off, then treatment should be interrupted until the amylase falls to less than twice the upper limit of normal, whereupon treatment can be resumed.  Cardiac conduction disturbances are less common, but [[electrocardiograph|ECG]] monitoring while the medicine is injected is advisable and changes quickly reverse after the drug is stopped or the infusion rate is decreased.

The drug can be given intramuscularly but is exceedingly painful when given by this route.  It can also be given intralesionally when treating [[cutaneous leishmaniasis]] (i.e., injected directly into the area of infected skin) and again, this is exceedingly painful and does not give results superior to intravenous administration.

Sodium stibogluconate can also cause a reduced appetite, metallic taste in mouth, [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[diarrhoea]], headache, tiredness, joint pains, muscle aches, dizziness, and [[anaphylaxis]].

==Dosing==
Sodium stibogluconate is available in the [[United Kingdom]] as Pentostam, where it is manufactured by [[GlaxoSmithKline]].  It is available in the [[United States]] on a named-patient basis from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC).

The dose of sodium stibogluconate is by slow intravenous infusion (at least five minutes with cardiac monitoring).  The injection are stopped if there is [[cough]]ing or central chest pain.  The chemotherapeutic index was established by [[Leonard Goodwin]] during the Second World War when a treatment was urgently required for Allied troops during the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|invasion of Sicily]].<ref name="tel">{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/4241645/Leonard-Goodwin.html|title=Leonard Goodwin  - Telegraph|date=14 January 2009|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=2009-01-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420055410/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/4241645/Leonard-Goodwin.html|archivedate=20 April 2009|df=}}</ref>

The duration of treatment is usually 10 to 21 days and depends on the species of ''[[Leishmania]]'' and the type of infection ([[cutaneous leishmaniasis|cutaneous]] or [[visceral leishmaniasis|visceral]]).

==Chemical structure==
The chemical structure of sodium stibogluconate is somewhat ambiguous, and the structure shown above is idealized.  Its solutions may contain multiple antimony compounds, although this heterogeneity may be unimportant.  It has been speculated that the active species contains only a single antimony centre.<ref>{{ cite journal | vauthors = Frézard F, Demicheli C, Ribeiro PR | title = Pentavalent Antimonials: New Perspectives for Old Drugs | journal = Molecules | year = 2009 | volume = 14 | issue = 7 | pages = 2317–2336 | doi = 10.3390/molecules14072317 | url = http://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/14/7/2317/pdf | format = pdf | pmid = 19633606 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303171646/http://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/14/7/2317/pdf | archivedate = 2016-03-03 | df =  }}</ref>

==Pharmacokinetics==
Although antimony itself is a cause of [[heavy metal poisoning]], stibogluconate does not appear to accumulate in the body and is excreted by the kidneys.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rees PH, Keating MI, Kager PA, Hockmeyer WT | title = Renal clearance of pentavalent antimony (sodium stibogluconate). | journal = Lancet | date = 1980 | volume = 2 | issue = 8188 | pages= 226&ndash;9 | pmid = 6105394 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(80)90120-8}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
The mechanism of sodium stibogluconate is poorly understood, but is thought to stem from the inhibition of macromolecular synthesis via a reduction in available ATP and GTP,  likely secondary to inhibition of the citric acid cycle and glycolysis. Bermann et al. studied the effects of stibogluconate on Leishmaniasis mexicana and demonstrated a 56-65% reduction in incorporation of a label into purine nucleoside triphosphates (ATP and GTP) as well as between a 34-60% increase of label incorporation into purine nucleoside mono and di phosphates (AMP, GMP, ADP, and GDP) following 4 hour exposure to stibogluconate.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Berman|first=J.
