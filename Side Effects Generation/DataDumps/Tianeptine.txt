<!-- History and culture -->
Tianeptine was discovered and patented by the French Society of Medical Research in the 1960s. Currently, tianeptine is approved in [[France]] and manufactured and marketed by Laboratories [[Servier]] SA; it is also marketed in a number of other European countries under the trade name Coaxil as well as in Asia (including [[Singapore]]) and Latin America as Stablon and Tatinol but it is not available in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom]], or the [[United States]].<ref name="akiki"/><ref name = MD>{{cite book|title=Tianeptine Sodium|date=5 December 2011|accessdate=2 December 2013|url=http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/martindale/current/17007-n.htm|work=Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference|publisher=Pharmaceutical Press|location=London, UK}}</ref>

Initial studies found that upon acute and repeated administration, tianeptine decreased the extracellular levels of serotonin in rat brain without a decrease in serotonin release and it was hence called a "(selective) serotonin [[reuptake enhancer]]".<ref name="akiki"/> In vitro tianeptine and its two principal metabolites showed no effects on monoamine uptake, release or neurotransmitter receptor binding in rats.<ref name="pmid3437921">{{cite journal |author1=Mennini, T |author2=Mocaer, E |author3=Garattini, S | title = Tianeptine, a selective enhancer of serotonin uptake in rat brain. | journal = Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol. | volume = 336 | issue = 5 | pages = 478–482 | year = 1987 | pmid = 3437921 | doi=10.1007/bf00169302}}</ref> The (−) [[enantiomer]] is more active in this sense than the (+) enantiomer.<ref>{{Cite journal |author1=Oluyomi, AO |author2=Datla, KP |author3=Curzon, G | title = Effects of the (+) and (-) enantiomers of the antidepressant drug tianeptine on 5-HTP-induced behaviour |journal = [[Neuropharmacology (journal)|Neuropharmacology]] | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 383–387 |date=March 1997  | pmid = 9175617 | doi=10.1016/s0028-3908(97)00016-6}}</ref> However, more recent studies found that long-term administration of tianeptine does not elicit any marked alterations (neither increases nor decreases) in extracellular levels of serotonin in rats.<ref name=mp09/> However, coadministration of tianeptine and the [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] [[fluoxetine]] inhibited tianeptine's effect on [[long-term potentiation]] in [[hippocampus anatomy|hippocampal CA1 area]]. This is considered an argument for the opposite effects of tianeptine and fluoxetine on serotonin uptake,<ref name="CNS2008" /> although it has been shown that [[fluoxetine]] can be partially substituted for tianeptine in animal studies.<ref name="pmid16292591">{{cite journal |author1=Alici, T |author2=Kayir, H |author3=Aygoren, MO |author4=Saglam, E |author5=Uzbay, IT |title=Discriminative stimulus properties of tianeptine |journal=Psychopharmacology |volume=183 |issue=4 |pages=446–51 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16292591 |doi=10.1007/s00213-005-0210-5 |url= }}</ref>

In contrast to most SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants, tianeptine modestly enhances the [[mesolimbic]] release of [[dopamine]]<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Invernizzi, R |author2=Pozzi, L |author3=Garattini, S |author4=Samanin, R |title=Tianeptine increases the extracellular concentrations of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens by a serotonin-independent mechanism |journal=Neuropharmacology|volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=221–7|date=March 1992 |pmid=1630590 |doi=10.1016/0028-3908(92)90171-K}}</ref> and potentiates [[Central nervous system|CNS]] [[Dopamine D2 receptor|D<sub>2</sub>]] and [[Dopamine D3 receptor|D<sub>3</sub> receptors]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dziedzicka-Wasylewska|first=M|author2=Rogoz, Z; Skuza, G; Dlaboga, D; Maj, J |title=Effect of repeated treatment with tianeptine and fluoxetine on central dopamine D(2) /D(3) receptors. |journal=Behavioural Pharmacology|date=March 2002  |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=127–138 |pmid=11981225 |doi=10.1097/00008877-200203000-00004}}</ref> but it is also unclear how this occurs because tianeptine has no affinity for the [[dopamine transporter]] or the [[dopamine receptor]]s.<ref name=mp09 />

Research suggests that tianeptine produces its antidepressant effects through indirect alteration of [[glutamate (neurotransmitter)|glutamate]] receptor activity (i.e., [[AMPA receptor]]s and [[NMDA receptor]]s) and release of {{abbrlink|BDNF|brain-derived neurotrophic factor}}, in turn affecting [[neural plasticity]].<ref name="mp09" /><ref name="pmid15550348" /><ref name="pmid15753957" /><ref name="pmid18221189" /<ref name="CNS2008" /><ref name="akiki" /> Some researchers hypothesize that tianeptine has a protective effect against stress induced [[neuroplasticity|neuronal remodeling]].<ref name=mp09/><ref name=CNS2008 /> There is also action on the [[NMDA receptor|NMDA]] and [[AMPA receptor]]s.<ref name=mp09/><ref name=CNS2008 /> In animal models, tianeptine inhibits the pathological stress-induced changes in glutamatergic neurotransmission in the amygdala and hippocampus. It may also facilitate signal transduction at the CA3 commissural associational synapse by altering the phosphorylation state of glutamate receptors. With the discovery of the rapid and novel antidepressant effects of drugs such as [[ketamine]], many believe the efficacy of antidepressants is related to promotion of [[synaptic plasticity]]. This may be achieved by regulating the excitatory amino acid systems that are responsible for changes in the strength of synaptic connections as well as enhancing [[BDNF]] expression, although these findings are based largely on [[preclinical]] studies.<ref name="akiki"/>

Research indicates possible [[anticonvulsant]] (anti-seizure) and [[analgesic]] (painkilling) activity of tianeptine via downstream modulation of [[adenosine]] [[adenosine A1 receptor|A<sub>1</sub> receptors]] (as the effects could be experimentally blocked by [[receptor antagonist|antagonists]] of this receptor).<ref name="pmid17826881"/>

====Atypical μ-opioid receptor agonist====
In 2014, tianeptine was found to be a [[μ-opioid receptor]] (MOR) [[full agonist]] using human proteins.<ref name="pmid25026323">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gassaway MM, Rives ML, Kruegel AC, Javitch JA, Sames D | title = The atypical antidepressant and neurorestorative agent tianeptine is a μ-opioid receptor agonist | journal = Transl Psychiatry | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = e411 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25026323 | pmc = 4119213 | doi = 10.1038/tp.2014.30 | url = }}</ref> It was also found to act as a full agonist of the [[δ-opioid receptor]] (DOR), although with approximately 200-fold lower potency.<ref name="pmid25026323" /> The same researchers subsequently found that the MOR is required for the acute and chronic antidepressant-like behavioral effects of tianeptine in mice and that its primary [[metabolite]] had similar activity as a MOR agonist but with a much longer [[elimination half-life]].<ref name="pmid28303899">{{cite journal | vauthors = Samuels BA, Nautiyal KM, Kruegel AC, Levinstein MR, Magalong VM, Gassaway MM, Grinnell SG, Han J, Ansonoff MA, Pintar JE, Javitch JA, Sames D, Hen R | title = The Behavioral Effects of the Antidepressant Tianeptine Require the Mu Opioid Receptor | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = | issue = | pages = | year = 2017 | pmid = 28303899 | doi = 10.1038/npp.2017.60 | url = }}</ref> Moreover, although tianeptine produced other [[opioid]]-like behavioral effects such as [[analgesia]] and [[reward system|reward]], it did not result in [[drug tolerance|tolerance]] or [[drug withdrawal|withdrawal]].<ref name="pmid28303899" /> The authors suggested that tianeptine may be acting as a [[biased agonist]] of the MOR and that this may be responsible for its atypical profile as a MOR agonist.<ref name="pmid28303899" /> However anecdotal reports from recreational, non-medical tianeptine users suggest that significant withdrawal effects resembling those of other typical opioid drugs (including but not limited to depression, insomnia, cold/flu-like symptoms) do manifest following prolonged high dose usage. In addition to its therapeutic effects, activation of the MOR is likely to also be responsible for the [[abuse potential]] of tianeptine at high doses that are well above the normal therapeutic range.<ref name="pmid25026323" />

When co-administered with morphine, tianeptine prevents morphine-induced [[respiratory depression]] without impairing analgesia.<ref name="pmid26068549">{{cite journal|last1=Cavalla|first1=D|last2=Chianelli|first2=F|title=Tianeptine prevents respiratory depression without affecting analgesic effect of opiates in conscious rats.|journal=European Journal of Pharmacology|date=August 2015|doi=10.1016/j.ejphar.2015.05.067|pmid=26068549}}</ref>

===Pharmacokinetics===
The [[bioavailability]] of tianeptine is approximately 99%.<ref name="pmid3180120" /><ref name="Tian2001" /> Its [[plasma protein binding]] is about 95%.<ref name="Tian2001" /> The [[metabolism]] of tianeptine is [[liver|hepatic]].<ref name="Tian2001" /> Its [[elimination half-life]] is 2.5 to 3&nbsp;hours.<ref name="pmid3180120" /><ref name="Tian2001" /> The elimination half-life has been found to be increased to 4 to 9&nbsp;hours in the [[elderly]].<ref name="CarlhantLeGarrec1990" /> The drug has an [[active metabolite]], with a much longer elimination half-life.<ref name="pmid28303899" /> Tianeptine is [[excretion|excreted]] 65% in the [[urine]] and 15% in [[feces]].<ref name="pmid3180120" /><ref name="Tian2001" />

===Analogues===
Although several related compounds are disclosed in the original patent,<ref>Charles Malen, Bernard Danrée, Jean-Claude Poignant. Nouveaux dérivés tricycliques et leur procédé de préparation. French Patent FR 2104728, 7 September 1971.</ref> it is unclear whether these share tianeptine's unique pharmacological effects. [[Amineptine]], the most closely related drug to have been widely studied, is a [[dopamine reuptake inhibitor]] with no significant effect on serotonin levels.

===Development===
Under the code names JNJ-39823277 and TPI-1062, tianeptine was previously under development for the treatment of major depressive disorder in the [[United States]] and [[Belgium]].<ref name="AdisInsight">{{cite web | title = Tianeptine - AdisInsight | author = AdisInsight | publisher = Springer | url = http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800039841 | accessdate = 31 January 2016}}</ref> [[Phases of clinical research#Phase I|Phase I]] [[clinical trial]]s were completed in Belgium and the United States in May and June 2009, respectively.<ref name="AdisInsight" /> For reasons that are unclear, development of tianeptine was discontinued in both countries in January 2012.<ref name="AdisInsight" />

===Recreational use===
Recreational use of tianeptine is rare and thus far has only been seen in persons already using multiple substances for recreational purposes. 141 cases of recreational use were identified in France between 1989 and 2004, correlating to an incidence of 1 to 3 cases per 1000 persons treated with tianeptine and 45 between 2006 and 2011. The main reason for recreational use is to achieve an anxiolytic effect. According to Servier, cessation of treatment with tianeptine is difficult, due to the possibility of [[drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms in a person. The severity of the withdrawal is dependent on the daily dose, with high doses being extremely difficult to quit.<ref>{{cite web | author=APM Health Europe| year=2007 | title= Addiction leads to warning on Servier's antidepressant Stablon  | url=http://health.apmnews.com/depechesPublieesDepeches.php?annee=2007&mois=5&jour=21 | accessdate=24 July 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author= Valerie Gibaja| year=2006 | title= Use, Drug Abuse and Tianeptine (in French) | url=http://www.chu-toulouse.fr/IMG/pdf/Actes_des_Xemes_rencontres_version_finale.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=24 July 2008 }}</ref><ref>http://www.prescrire.org/fr/3/31/47483/0/NewsDetails.aspx</ref>

In 2007, according to [[French Health Products Safety Agency]], tianeptine's manufacturer Servier agreed to modify the drug's label, following problems with dependency.<ref>{{cite web | author=French Health Products Safety Agency (Afssaps)| year=2007 | title=Important Information on Drug: Update of the Summary of Product Characteristics Stablon, 16 May 2007 (French)|url=http://agmed.sante.gouv.fr/htm/10/filltrpsc/lp070502.htm | accessdate=24 July 2008 }}</ref>

[[Singapore]]'s Ministry of Health has restricted the use of tianeptine to psychiatrists due to its recreational potential,<ref>{{cite web|author=World Health Organization| year=2001 | title=Pharmaceuticals: Restrictions in use and availability, March 2001|url=http://www.who.int/medicinedocs/pdf/s2203e/s2203e.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=24 July 2008 }}</ref> while [[Bahrain]] has classified it a controlled substance due to increasing reports of misuse and recreational use by persons.<ref>{{cite web | author=World Health Organization|year=2003 | title=Pharmaceuticals: Restrictions in use and availability, April 2003|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2003/EDM_QSM_2003.5.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=24 July 2008 }}</ref> In September 2012, France began treating Stablon as a controlled substance. Its use now requires a "secure prescription" form in France, just as is required for narcotics.

Tianeptine has been intravenously injected by drug users in [[Russia]].<ref name=mrp>{{cite web|author=Richard Ives | year=2008 |title=Assessment Mission Report for the SCAD V Programme, Component on Prevention and on Media Work|url=http://scadarmenia.org/docs/eng/mission_report_prevention.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=4 November 2008}}</ref><ref name=dt>{{cite web| work=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime | date=April 2008|title=Illicit Drug Trades in the Russian Federation|url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/regional/central-asia/Illicit%20Drug%20Trends%20Report_Russia.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref> This method of administration reportedly causes an [[opioid]]-like effect and is sometimes used in an attempt to lessen [[opioid#Dependence|opioid withdrawal symptoms]].<ref name=mrp /> Tianeptine tablets contain [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] and do not dissolve completely. Often the solution is not filtered well thus particles in the injected fluid block [[Capillary|capillaries]], leading to [[thrombosis]] and then severe [[necrosis]]. Thus, in Russia tianeptine (sold under the brand name “Coaxil”) is a Schedule III controlled substance in the same list as the majority of [[benzodiazepines]] and [[barbiturates]].<ref>[http://base.garant.ru/12112176 Decision of the Government of the Russian Federation No. 681 of June 30, 1998 on the Approval of the List of Narcotic Drugs, Psychotropic Substances and Their Precursors That Shall Be Subject to Control in the Russian Federation (with Amendments and Additions) ''(in Russian)'']</ref>
