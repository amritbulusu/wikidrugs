'''Mexx''' was an international fashion company that designed clothes and accessories for men, women and children.

==History==
In the 1970s, fashion designer [[Rattan Chadha]] and his business partners PK Sen Sharma, Adu Advaney, Suveer Arora, Ronny Lemmens, Horatio Ho and Arun Mehta (known as the Founders of the company) supplied clothes for department and [[wholesale]] stores in the [[Netherlands]], which were specifically designed and labelled for the stores. Revamping the business in 1980, they created two popular clothing brands—"Moustache" for men and "Emanuelle" for women. Both labels had coordinated collections focused on lifestyle and youth fashion.  In 1986, the two brand names were merged to form: '''M''' (from Moustache) + '''E''' (from Emanuelle) + '''XX''' (an abbreviation for "kiss kiss") to create MEXX.<ref name=mexx/>

Over time, Mexx has grown to become an international brand with over 800 stores in 55 countries and more than 10,000 point of sales.  It has grown rapidly and is now an internationally prominent company, employing over 6,000 people worldwide.<ref name=mexx>[http://www.mexx.com/mexxcms/opencms/mexx.com/site/company/whosmexx/index.jsp]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228050204/http://www.mexx.com/mexxcms/opencms/mexx.com/site/company/whosmexx/index.jsp |date=December 28, 2007 }}</ref>
