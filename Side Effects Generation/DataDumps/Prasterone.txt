'''Prasterone''', also known as '''dehydroepiandrosterone''' ('''DHEA'''), is a [[natural product|naturally occurring]] [[steroid]] which is used as a [[dietary supplement|supplement]] and [[medication]]. It is an [[androstane]] [[chemical derivative|derivative]] and a [[precursor (biochemistry)|precursor]] of [[steroid hormone]]s like [[testosterone]] and [[estradiol]]. Prasterone has weak [[androgen]]ic activity, weak [[estrogen]]ic activity, and [[neurosteroid]] activity, and acts as a [[prohormone]] of androgens and estrogens depending on its [[wikt:dosage|dosage]] and [[route of administration]]. As a medication, prasterone may be used to restore or increase DHEA levels in deficiency or old age, for [[menopause|menopausal]] women as a weak androgen or to treat [[atrophic vaginitis|vaginal atrophy]], and, in its sulfate form, for [[cervical dilation]] during [[childbirth]].

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Medical uses==

===Deficiency===
DHEA and DHEA sulfate are produced by the [[adrenal gland]]s. In people with [[adrenal insufficiency]] such as in [[Addison's disease]], there may be deficiency of DHEA and DHEA sulfate. In addition, levels of these steroids decrease throughout life and are 70 to 80% lower in the elderly relative to levels in young adults. As such, DHEA and DHEA sulfate levels are also lower in older people. Prasterone can be used to increase DHEA and DHEA sulfate levels in adrenal insufficiency and older age. Although there is deficiency of these steroids in such individuals, clinical benefits of supplementation, if any, are uncertain, and there is insufficient evidence at present to support the use of prasterone for such purposes.<ref name="pmid15261843">{{cite journal|last=Arlt|first=W|title=Dehydroepiandrosterone and ageing|journal=Best practice & research.

As a hormone precursor, there have been reports of side effects possibly caused by the hormone metabolites of prasterone.<ref name=WebMD>{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/druginfo/dosage?cid=med&drugid=3512&drugname=DHEA+Oral&monotype=default|title=DHEA Oral|last=Medscape|year=2010|work=Drug Reference|publisher=WebMD LLC.|accessdate=18 February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/patient-dhea.html#Safety|title=DHEA|last=Medline Plus|work=Drugs and Supplements Information|publisher=National Library of Medicine|accessdate=18 February 2010}}</ref>

It is not known whether prasterone is safe for long-term use. Some researchers believe prasterone supplements might actually raise the risk of [[breast cancer]], [[prostate cancer]], [[heart disease]], [[diabetes]],<ref name=WebMD/> and [[stroke]]. Prasterone may stimulate tumor growth in types of cancer that are sensitive to hormones, such as some types of breast, uterine, and prostate cancer.<ref name=WebMD/> Prasterone may increase prostate swelling in men with [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] (BPH), an enlarged prostate gland.<ref name=cancer/>

Prasterone is a [[steroid hormone]]. High doses may cause aggressiveness, irritability, trouble sleeping, and the growth of body or facial hair on women.<ref name=cancer/> It also may stop menstruation and lower the levels of [[High-density lipoprotein|HDL]] ("good" cholesterol), which could raise the risk of heart disease.<ref name=cancer/> Other reported side effects include acne, heart rhythm problems, liver problems, hair loss (from the scalp), and oily skin. It may also alter the body's regulation of blood sugar.<ref name=cancer/>

Prasterone may promote [[tamoxifen]] resistance.<ref name=cancer/> Patients on hormone replacement therapy may have more estrogen-related side effects when taking prasterone.

==Chemistry==
{{See also|List of androgens/anabolic steroids}}

Prasterone, also known as '''androst-5-en-3β-ol-17-one''', is a [[natural product|naturally occurring]] [[androstane]] [[steroid]] and a [[17-ketosteroid]]. It is closely related structurally to [[5-androstenediol|androstenediol]] (androst-5-ene-3β,17β-diol), [[4-androstenedione|androstenedione]] (androst-4-ene-3,17-dione), and [[testosterone]] (androst-4-en-17β-ol-3-one). Prasterone is the 5-[[dehydrogenation|dehydro]] [[structural analog|analogue]] of [[epiandrosterone]] (5α-androstan-3β-ol-17-one) and is also known as '''5-dehydroepiandrosterone''' or as '''δ<sup>5</sup>-epiandrosterone'''.

===Derivatives===
{{See also|List of androgen esters#Esters of other natural AAS}}

Prasterone is used medically as the C3β [[ester]]s [[prasterone enanthate]] and [[prasterone sodium sulfate]].<ref name="Elks2014" /> Another derivative is [[fluasterone]] (16α-fluoro-DHEA).<ref name="pmid15177053" />

===Marketing===
In the United States, prasterone or prasterone sulfate have been advertised, under the names DHEA and DHEA-S, with claims that they may be beneficial for a wide variety of ailments. Prasterone and prasterone sulfate are readily available in the United States, where they are sold as [[over-the-counter]] [[dietary supplement]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Calfee, R. |author2=Fadale, P. |title=Popular ergogenic drugs and supplements in young athletes |journal=Pediatrics |volume=117 |issue=3|pages=e577–89 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16510635 |doi=10.1542/peds.2005-1429 |url=|quote=In 2004, a new Steroid Control Act that placed androstenedione under Schedule III of controlled substances effective January 2005 was signed. DHEA was not included in this act and remains an over-the-counter nutritional supplement.}}</ref>

===Regulation===

====United States====
Prasterone is legal to sell in the United States as a dietary supplement. It is currently [[Grandfather clause|grandfathered]] in as an "Old Dietary Ingredient" being on sale prior to 1994. Prasterone is specifically exempted from the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 1990 and 2004.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/rules/2005/fr1216.htm | title = Drug Scheduling Actions – 2005 | publisher = [[Drug Enforcement Administration]]}}</ref>
It is banned from use in athletic competition.

====Canada====
In Canada, prasterone is a Controlled Drug listed under Section 23 of Schedule IV of the ''Controlled Drugs and Substances Act''<ref>[http://webprod.hc-sc.gc.ca/nhpid-bdipsn/ingredReq.do?id=4639&lang=eng Health Canada, DHEA listing in the Ingredient Database]</ref> and as such is available by prescription only.

====Australia====
In Australia, a prescription is required to buy prasterone, where it is also comparatively expensive compared to off-the-shelf purchases in US supplement shops. Australian customs classify prasterone as an "anabolic steroid[s] or precursor[s]" and, as such, it is only possible to carry prasterone into the country through customs if one possesses an import permit which may be obtained if one has a valid prescription for the hormone.<ref>[http://www.tga.gov.au/consumers/personal-importation-scheme.htm Therapeutic Goods Administration, Personal Importation Scheme]</ref>

====United Kingdom====
Prasterone is listed as an [[anabolic steroid]] and is thus a [[Drugs controlled by the UK Misuse of Drugs Act|class C controlled drug]].

====Sports and athletics====
Prasterone is a prohibited substance under the World Anti-Doping Code of the World Anti-Doping Agency,<ref>[http://www.wada-ama.org/en/ World Anti-Doping Agency]</ref> which manages drug testing for Olympics and other sports. In January 2011, [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] player [[O. J. Mayo]] was given a 10-game suspension after testing positive for prasterone. Mayo termed his use of prasterone as "an honest mistake," saying the prasterone was in an [[over-the-counter]] supplement and that he was unaware the supplement was banned by the NBA.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=6065824 Memphis Grizzlies' O. J. Mayo gets 10-game drug suspension], ''ESPN'', January 27, 2011.</ref> Mayo is the seventh player to test positive for performance-enhancing drugs since the league began testing in 1999. Rashard Lewis, then with the Orlando Magic, tested positive for prasterone and was suspended 10 games before the start of the 2009-10 season.<ref>[http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2011/jan/27/oj-mayo-suspended-10-games-violating-nba-anti-drug/ Memphis Grizzlies' O. J.

===Anabolic uses===

====Body composition====
A meta-analysis of intervention studies shows that prasterone supplementation in elderly men can induce a small but significant positive effect on body composition that is strictly dependent on prasterone conversion into its bioactive metabolites such as androgens or estrogens.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=23824417 | doi=10.1210/jc.2013-1358 | volume=98 | title=Dehydroepiandrosterone supplementation in elderly men: a meta-analysis study of placebo-controlled trials | year=2013 | journal=J.

===Cancer===
There is no evidence prasterone is of benefit in treating or preventing [[cancer]].<ref name=cancer/> Although prasterone is postulated as an inhibitor towards [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]] (G6PD) and suppresses leukemia cell proliferation ''in vitro'',<ref name="Di_1997">{{cite journal | vauthors = Di Monaco M, Pizzini A, Gatto V, Leonardi L, Gallo M, Brignardello E, Boccuzzi G | title = Role of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase inhibition in the antiproliferative effects of dehydroepiandrosterone on human breast cancer cells | journal = Br J Cancer | volume = 75 | pages = 589–92| date = 1997 | pmid = 9052415 | doi=10.1038/bjc.1997.102 | pmc=2063293}}</ref><ref name="Xu_2016">{{cite journal | vauthors = Xu SN, Wang TS, Li X, Wang YP | title = SIRT2 activates G6PD to enhance NADPH production and promote leukaemia cell proliferation | journal = Sci Rep | volume = 6 | pages = 32734| date = Sep 2016 | pmid = 27586085 | doi = 10.1038/srep32734 | pmc=5009355}}</ref> Prasterone may enhance G6PD mRNA expression, confounding its inhibitory effects.<ref name="Hecker_2013">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hecker PA, Leopold JA, Gupte SA, Recchia FA, Stanley WC | title = Impact of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency on the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease | journal = Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol | volume = 304 | pages = H491-500 | date = Feb 2013 | pmid = 23241320 | doi=10.1152/ajpheart.00721.2012 | pmc=3566485}}</ref>

===Cardiovascular disease===
A review in 2003 found the then-extant evidence sufficient to suggest that low serum levels of DHEA-S may be associated with coronary heart disease in men, but insufficient to determine whether prasterone supplementation would have any cardiovascular benefit.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 14609305 | volume=58 | issue=5 | title=Are low dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate levels predictive for cardiovascular diseases?

===Drug addiction===
A double-blind, placebo-controlled study in adult polydrug users in a detoxification program showed the efficacy of prasterone treatment combined with psychosocial enrichment and after-care. Prasterone administration positively affected decision-making, mood and well-being as early as one month into treatment, and had a long-lasting preventive effect on relapse to drug use. In a 16-month follow-up, relapse rates of prasterone-treated subjects were only 11.5%. No adverse symptoms were found. These findings demonstrate the long-term effect of prasterone on drug relapse.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ohana|first=D |author2=Maayan, R |author3=Delayahu, Y |author4=Roska, P |author5=Ponizovsky, AM |author6=Weizman, A |author7=Yadid, G |author8=Yechiam, E|title=Effect of dehydroepiandrosterone add-on therapy on mood, decision making and subsequent relapse of polydrug=Addiction Biology : |date=March 2015|volume=21|issue=4|pages=885–94|pmid= 25818161}}</ref>

===Lupus===
There is some evidence of short-term benefit in those with [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] but little evidence of long-term benefit or safety.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Crosbie|first=D|author2=Black, C|author3=McIntyre, L|author4=Royle, PL|author5=Thomas, S|title=Dehydroepiandrosterone for systemic lupus erythematosus|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=Oct 17, 2007|issue=4|page=CD005114|pmid=17943841|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005114.pub2|editor1-last=Crosbie|editor1-first=David}}</ref>

===Memory===
Prasterone supplementation has not been found to be useful for memory function in normal middle aged or older adults.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Grimley Evans|first=J |author2=Malouf, R |author3=Huppert, F |author4=van Niekerk, JK|title=Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) supplementation for cognitive function in healthy elderly people|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=Oct 18, 2006|issue=4|page=CD006221|pmid=17054283|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006221|editor1-last=Malouf|editor1-first=Reem}}</ref> It has been studied as a treatment for [[Alzheimer's disease]], but there is no evidence that it is effective.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fuller|first=SJ |author2=Tan, RS |author3=Martins, RN|title=Androgens in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease in aging men and possible therapeutic interventions|journal=Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD|date=September 2007|volume=12|issue=2|pages=129–42|pmid=17917157}}</ref>

===Mood===
A few small, short term clinical studies have found that prasterone improves mood but its long-term efficacy and safety, and how it compares to [[antidepressants]], was unknown as of 2015.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pluchino|first1=N|last2=Drakopoulos|first2=P|last3=Bianchi-Demicheli|first3=F|last4=Wenger|first4=JM|last5=Petignat|first5=P|last6=Genazzani|first6=AR|title=Neurobiology of DHEA and effects on sexuality, mood and cognition.|journal=The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology|date=January 2015|volume=145|pages=273–80|doi=10.1016/j.jsbmb.2014.04.012|pmid=24892797}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Maric|first1=NP|last2=Adzic|first2=M|title=Pharmacological modulation of HPA axis in depression - new avenues for potential therapeutic benefits.|journal=Psychiatria Danubina|date=September 2013|volume=25|issue=3|pages=299–305|pmid=24048401|url=http://www.hdbp.org/psychiatria_danubina/pdf/dnb_vol25_no3/dnb_vol25_no3_299.pdf}}</ref>

====Strength====
Evidence is inconclusive in regards to the effect of prasterone on strength in the elderly.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=WL|author2=Karan, S|author3=Kenny, AM|title=Effect of dehydroepiandrosterone on muscle strength and physical function in older adults: a systematic review|journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society|date=June 2011|volume=59|issue=6|pages=997–1002|pmid=21649617|doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.2011.03410.x}}</ref>

In middle-aged men, no significant effect of prasterone supplementation on lean body mass, strength, or [[testosterone]] levels was found in a randomized placebo-controlled trial.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Wallace, M. B. |author2=Lim, J. |author3=Cutler, A. |author4=Bucci, L. |title=Effects of dehydroepiandrosterone vs androstenedione supplementation in men |journal=Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise |volume=31 |issue=12|pages=1788–92 |year=1999 |pmid=10613429 |doi=10.1097/00005768-199912000-00014}}</ref>
