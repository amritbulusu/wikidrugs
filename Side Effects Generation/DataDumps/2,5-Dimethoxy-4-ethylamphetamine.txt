'''2,5-Dimethoxy-4-ethylamphetamine''' ('''DOET''', '''DOE''', '''Hecate''') is a [[psychedelic_drug|psychedelic]] [[drug]] of the [[substituted phenethylamine|phenethylamine]] and [[substituted amphetamine|amphetamine]] [[chemical class]]es. It was first [[Organic synthesis|synthesized]] by [[Alexander Shulgin]], and was described in his book ''[[PiHKAL]]'' (''Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved'').<ref name="PiHKAL">{{cite book | title = PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story | last = Shulgin | first = Alexander |author2= Shulgin, Ann   | publisher = Transform Press | location = United States | isbn = 0-9630096-0-5 | pages = 978 | url = https://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal.shtml |date= September 1991}}</ref>

== Chemistry ==
DOET is in a class of compounds commonly known as [[substituted amphetamine]]s; its full chemical name is 4-ethyl-2,5-dimethoxy-alpha-methylbenzeneethanamine, or 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylphenyl)propan-2-amine. It has an active [[stereocenter]] and (R)-DOET is the more active enantiomer. DOET is an extremely rare compound and reports of its effects and toxicology in humans are sparse.  However, like the more common 2,5-dimethoxy-amphetamine analogues DOB, DOI and DOM, it is a potent and long-acting psychedelic.  Removal of the alpha-methyl moiety yields the 2-carbon analogue, commonly known as [[2C-E]], another psychedelic compound first synthesized by Dr. [[Alexander Shulgin]].

== Pharmacology ==
Similarly to related drugs like [[2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine|DOM]], DOET likely acts as a [[5-HT2A|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]], [[5-HT2B|5-HT<sub>2B</sub>]], and [[5-HT2C|5-HT<sub>2C</sub>]] [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] [[partial agonist]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} It is an agonist of human [[TAAR1]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Articleid 50034244|url=http://www.bindingdb.org/jsp/dbsearch/PrimarySearch_pubmed.jsp?pubmed=50034244&pubmed_submit=TBD|work=Binding Database|accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Compound ID: CHEMBL2360469|url=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/compound/inspect/CHEMBL2360469|work=ChEMBL|accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref> 

== Effects ==
DOET produces psychedelic effects that last up 14-20 hours. In PiHKAL, Shulgin lists the dosage of DOET as being 2-7 mg orally, with 6-7 mg being the dosage for full, desired effects.<ref name="PiHKAL">{{cite book | title = PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story | last = Shulgin | first = Alexander |author2= Shulgin, Ann   | publisher = Transform Press | location = United States | isbn = 0-9630096-0-5 | pages = 978 | url = https://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal.shtml |date= September 1991}}</ref>

== Legal Status ==
Internationally, DOET is a Schedule I controlled drug under the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20070302130637/http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/green.pdf].
===United States===
DOET is classified as a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule I drugs|Schedule I]] substance in the United States, and is similarly controlled in other parts of the world. 

===Australia===
DOET is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the [[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons|Poisons Standard]] (October 2015).<ref name="Poisons Standard">Poisons Standard October 2015 https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2015L01534</ref> A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.<ref name="Poisons Standard" />
