'''Avobenzone''' ([[trade name]]s '''Parsol 1789''', '''Milestab 1789''', '''Eusolex 9020''', '''Escalol 517''', '''Neo Heliopan 357''' and others, [[International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients|INCI]] Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane) is an oil-soluble ingredient used in [[sunscreen]] products to absorb the full spectrum of [[Ultraviolet|UVA]] rays.

==History==
Avobenzone was patented in 1973 and was approved in the EU in 1978. It was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] in 1988. Its use is approved worldwide.

=== Stability ===
Avobenzone is sensitive to the properties of the solvent, being relatively stable in polar protic solvents and unstable in nonpolar environments. Also, when it is irradiated with UVA light, it generates a triplet excited state in the keto form which can either cause the avobenzone to degrade or it can transfer energy to biological targets and cause deleterious effects.<ref name="Paris2009" />

Avobenzone has been shown to degrade significantly in light, resulting in less protection over time.<ref>{{cite journal

=== Various ===
As an enolate, avobenzone forms with heavy metal ions (such as [[Fe3+|Fe<sup>3+</sup>]]) colored complexes, and [[chelating agents]] can be added to suppress them. [[Stearate]]s, aluminum, magnesium and zinc salts can lead to poorly soluble precipitates.<ref name="Making Cosmetics" /> Manufacturers also recommend to avoid the inclusion of iron and ferric salts, [[heavy metals]], formaldehyde donors and [[4-Aminobenzoic acid|PABA]] and PABA esters. The makers of Coppertone advise that avobenzone binds iron and can cause staining of clothes washed in iron-rich water. The staining properties of sunblock made with avobenzone are particularly noticeable on fiberglass boats with white gelcoat.

Avobenzone also reacts with boron trifluoride to form a stable crystalline complex that is highly fluorescent under UV irradiation. More interestingly, the emission color of the crystals relies on the molecular packing of the boron avobenzone complex. The photoluminescence may also be altered by mechanical force in the solid state, resulting in a phenomenon called "[[mechanochromic luminescence]]". The altered emission color recovers itself slowly at room temperature or more swiftly at higher temperatures.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Polymorphism and Reversible Mechanochromic Luminescence for Solid-State Difluoroboron Avobenzone|date=February 2010

== Preparation ==
The compound is prepared by reacting [[4-tert-butylbenzoic methyl ester]] (from [[4-tert-Butylbenzoic acid|4-tert-butylbenzoic acid]] by [[esterification]] with methanol) with [[4-methoxyacetophenone]] in [[toluene]] in the presence of [[sodium amide]] via [[Claisen condensation]].<ref>{{Patent|Land = US|V-Nr =4387089 |Code= |Titel= 4-(1,1-Dimethylethyl)-4′-methoxydibenzoylmethane |V-Datum =1983-6-7 |A-Datum =1981-5-18 |Erfinder=K.-F.

== Safety ==
Although avobenzone is considered safe, disintegration products may have significant health impacts and persist in the environment. A recent study at Lomonosov Moscow State University found that chlorinated water and ultraviolet light can cause avobenzone to disintegrate into various other organic compounds, including aromatic acids, aldehydes, phenols, and acetyl benzynes. Some of these compounds are known to be cancer causing.  <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-06/lmsu-scb062717.php|title=Sunscreen creams break down into dangerous chemical compounds under the sunlight|website=EurekAlert!|language=en|access-date=2017-06-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Cheng|last2=Bavcon Kralj|first2=Mojca|last3=Košmrlj|first3=Berta|last4=Yao|first4=Jun|last5=Košenina|first5=Suzana|last6=Polyakova|first6=Olga V.|last7=Artaev|first7=Viatcheslav B.|last8=Lebedev|first8=Albert T.|last9=Trebše|first9=Polonca|date=September 2017|title=Stability and removal of selected avobenzone's chlorination products|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653517306203|journal=Chemosphere|volume=182|pages=238–244|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.04.125}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Trebše|first=Polonca|last2=Polyakova|first2=Olga V.|last3=Baranova|first3=Maria|last4=Kralj|first4=Mojca Bavcon|last5=Dolenc|first5=Darko|last6=Sarakha|first6=Mohamed|last7=Kutin|first7=Alexander|last8=Lebedev|first8=Albert T.|date=2016-09-15|title=Transformation of avobenzone in conditions of aquatic chlorination and UV-irradiation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135416303931|journal=Water Research|volume=101|pages=95–102|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2016.05.067}}</ref>
