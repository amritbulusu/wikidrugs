'''Niacin''', also known as '''nicotinic acid''', is an [[organic compound]] and is, depending on the definition used, one of the 20 to 80 [[essential nutrient|essential human nutrients]]. Together with [[nicotinamide]] it makes up the group known as [[vitamin B3 complex|vitamin B<sub>3</sub> complex]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Krutmann|first1=Jean|last2=Humbert|first2=Philippe|title=Nutrition for Healthy Skin: Strategies for Clinical and Cosmetic Practice|date=2010|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9783642122644|page=153|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUNZHmpBu2sC&pg=PA153|language=en}}</ref> It has the [[chemical formula|formula]] {{chem|C|6|H|5|NO|2}} and belongs to the group of the [[pyridinecarboxylic acids]].

Medication and [[dietary supplement|supplemental]] niacin are primarily used to treat [[hypercholesterolemia|high blood cholesterol]] and [[pellagra]] (niacin deficiency). Insufficient niacin in the diet can cause nausea, skin and mouth lesions, anemia, headaches, and tiredness. The lack of niacin may also be observed in [[pandemic]] [[Nutrition disorder|deficiency disease]], which is caused by a lack of five crucial vitamins (niacin, [[vitamin C]], [[thiamin]], [[vitamin D]], and [[vitamin A]]) and is usually found in areas of widespread poverty and malnutrition. Niacin is provided in the diet from a variety of [[whole food|whole]] and [[processed foods]], with highest contents in [[fortified food|fortified]] [[packaged food]]s and [[meat]] from various animal sources. Some countries require its addition to [[food grains|grains]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ffinetwork.org/why_fortify/index.html |publisher=Food Fortification Initiative|title=Why fortify?|date=2017|accessdate=4 April 2017}}</ref>

This colorless, water-soluble solid is a derivative of [[pyridine]], with a [[carboxyl group]] (COOH) at the 3-position. Other forms of vitamin B<sub>3</sub> include the corresponding [[amide]] [[nicotinamide]] ("niacinamide"), where the carboxyl group has been replaced by a carboxamide group ({{chem|CONH|2}}), as well as more complex amides and a variety of esters. Nicotinic acid and niacinamide are convertible to each other with steady world demand rising from 8,500 tonnes per year in the 1980s to 40,000 in recent years.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cantarella L, Gallifuoco A, Malandra A, Martínková L, Spera A, Cantarella M | title = High-yield continuous production of nicotinic acid via nitrile hydratase-amidase cascade reactions using cascade CSMRs | journal = Enzyme and Microbial Technology | volume = 48 | issue = 4–5 | pages = 345–50 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22112948 | doi = 10.1016/j.enzmictec.2010.12.010 }}</ref>

==Dietary recommendations==
The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for B vitamins in 1998. The current EARs for niacin for women and men ages 14 and up are 11&nbsp;mg/day and 12&nbsp;mg/day, respectively; the RDAs are 14 and 16&nbsp;mg/day, respectively. RDAs are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements. RDA for pregnancy is 18&nbsp;mg/day. RDA for lactation is 17&nbsp;mg/day. For infants up to 12 months the Adequate Intake (AI) is 2–4&nbsp;mg/day. For children ages 1–13 years the RDA increases with age from 6 to 12&nbsp;mg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets [[Tolerable upper intake level]]s (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of niacin the UL is set at 35&nbsp;mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s (DRIs).<ref name="DRItext">{{cite book | last1 = [[Institute of Medicine]] | title = Dietary Reference Intakes for Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin, and Choline | chapter = Niacin | publisher = The National Academies Press | year = 1998 | location = Washington, DC | pages = 123-149 | url = https://www.nap.edu/read/6015/chapter/8 | accessdate = 2017-08-29 | isbn = 0-309-06554-2}}</ref>  

The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values (DRV), with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined the same as in United States. For women (including those pregnant or lactating), men and children the PRI is 1.6 mg niacin per megajoule (MJ) of energy consumed. As the conversion is 1 MJ = 238.8 kcal, an adult consuming 2388 calories should be consuming 16 mg niacin. This is comparable to U.S. RDAs.<ref name="EFSAtext">{{cite web | title = Overview on Dietary Reference Values for the EU population as derived by the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies| year = 2017| url = https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf}}</ref> The niacin UL is set at 10&nbsp;mg/day, which is much less than the U.S. value. The UL applies to niacin as a supplement consumed as one dose, and in intended to avoid the skin flush reaction. This explains why the PRI can be higher than the UL.<ref>{{cite web | title = Tolerable Upper Intake Levels For Vitamins And Minerals| publisher = European Food Safety Authority| year = 2006| url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf}}</ref>

Both the DRI and DRV describe amounts needed as niacin equivalents (NE), calculated as 1 mg NE = 1 mg niacin or 60 mg of the essential amino acid tryptophan. This is because the amino acid is utilized to synthesize the vitamin.<ref name="DRItext" /><ref name="EFSAtext" />  

For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For niacin labeling purposes 100% of the Daily Value was 20 mg, but as of May 27, 2016 it was revised to 16 mg to bring it into agreement with the RDA.<ref name="FedReg">{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-27/pdf/2016-11867.pdf |title=Federal Register May 27, 2016 Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels}}</ref> A table of the old and new adult Daily Values is provided at [[Reference Daily Intake]]. Food and supplement companies have until July 28, 2018 to comply with the change.

===Food sources===
Niacin is found in a variety of [[whole food|whole]] and [[processed foods]], including [[fortified food|fortified]] [[packaged food]]s, [[meat]] from various animal sources, [[seafoods]], and [[spices]].<ref name="usda">{{cite web|url=https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/nutrients/report/nutrientsfrm?max=25&offset=0&totCount=0&nutrient1=406&nutrient2=&nutrient3=&subset=1&fg=13&fg=1&fg=15&fg=17&fg=10&fg=5&fg=2&fg=11&sort=c&measureby=g|title=Niacin content per 100 grams; select food subset, abridged list by food groups|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, USDA Branded Food Products Database v.3.6.4.1|date=17 January 2017|accessdate=23 January 2017}}</ref>

==Side effects==
The most common adverse effects are flushing (e.g., warmth, redness, itching or tingling), headache, pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, rhinitis, pruritus and rash. These can be minimized by initiating therapy at low dosages, increasing dosage gradually, and avoiding administration on an empty stomach.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> High doses of niacin often temporarily reduce blood pressure as a result of acute [[vasodilation]].<ref name="pmid19054161">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bays HE, Rader DJ | title = Does nicotinic acid (niacin) lower blood pressure? | journal = Int.

===Facial flushing===
Flushing usually lasts for about 15 to 30 minutes, though it can sometimes last up to two hours. It is sometimes accompanied by a prickly or [[itching]] sensation, in particular, in areas covered by clothing. Flushing can be blocked by taking 300&nbsp;mg of [[aspirin]] half an hour before taking niacin, by taking one tablet of [[ibuprofen]] per day or by co-administering the [[prostaglandin receptor]] [[antagonist]] [[laropiprant]]. Taking niacin with meals also helps reduce this side effect. Acquired tolerance will also help reduce flushing; after several weeks of a consistent dose, most patients no longer experience flushing.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Guidelines for Niacin Therapy For the Treatment of Elevated Lipoprotein a (Lpa)  | publisher = [[Rush University Medical Center|Rush Hemophilia & Thrombophilia Center]]  | url = http://www.rush.edu/Rush_Document/Niacin%20therapy%20for%20elevated%20Lpa,0.pdf  | quote = facial flushing is a common side effect of niacin therapy that usually subsides after several weeks of consistent niacin use  | origyear = 15 August 2002| date = 27 July 2005  | accessdate = 20 November 2009}}</ref> Reduction of flushing focuses on altering or blocking the prostaglandin mediated pathway.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kamanna VS, Kashyap ML | title = Mechanism of action of niacin | journal = The American journal of cardiology | volume = 101 | issue = 8A | pages = 20B–26B | year = 2008 | pmid = 18375237 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjcard.2008.02.029 }}</ref>  Slow- or "sustained"-release forms of niacin have been developed to lessen these side effects.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book |author=Katzung, Bertram G. |title=Basic and clinical pharmacology |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical Publishing Division |location=New York |year=2006 |isbn=0-07-145153-6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = Options for therapeutic intervention: How effective are the different agents? | journal = European Heart Journal Supplements | volume = 8 | pages = F47–F53 | doi = 10.1093/eurheartj/sul041 | last = Barter | first = P | year = 2006 | issue = F}}</ref>  One study showed the incidence of flushing was significantly lower with a [[sustained release|sustained-release]] formulation,<ref name="pmid15324528">{{cite journal |vauthors=Chapman MJ, Assmann G, Fruchart JC, Shepherd J, Sirtori C | title = Raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol with reduction of cardiovascular risk: the role of nicotinic acid—a position paper developed by the European Consensus Panel on HDL-C | journal = Curr Med Res Opin | volume = 20 | issue = 8 | pages = 1253–68 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15324528 | doi = 10.1185/030079904125004402 }}</ref> though doses above 2 g per day have been associated with [[hepatotoxicity|liver damage]], in particular, with slow-release formulations.<ref name = G&G/>

==Deficiency==
{{Main article|Pellagra}}
[[File:Pellagra NIH.jpg|thumb|A man with pellagra, which is caused by a chronic lack of vitamin B<sub>3</sub> in the diet.]]
Between 1906 and 1940 more than 3 million Americans were affected by pellagra with more than 100,000 deaths. [[Joseph Goldberger]] was assigned to study pellagra by the Surgeon General of the United States and produced good results. In the late 1930s, studies by [[Tom Spies]], Marion Blankenhorn, and Clark Cooper established that niacin cured pellagra in humans. The disease was greatly reduced as a result.

At present, niacin deficiency is sometimes seen in developed countries, and it is usually apparent in conditions of poverty, malnutrition, and chronic alcoholism.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Pitsavas S, Andreou C, Bascialla F, Bozikas VP, Karavatos A | title = Pellagra encephalopathy following B-complex vitamin treatment without niacin | journal = Int J Psychiatry Med | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 91–5 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15242145 | doi = 10.2190/29XV-1GG1-U17K-RGJH | url = http://baywood.metapress.com/link.asp?id=29xv1gg1u17krgjh }}</ref>  It also tends to occur in less developed areas where people eat [[maize]] (corn) as a staple food, as maize is the only grain low in digestible niacin.  A cooking technique called [[nixtamalization]] i.e., pretreating with alkali ingredients, increases the bioavailability of niacin during maize meal/flour production. For this reason, people who consume corn as tortillas or hominy are not at risk of niacin deficiency.

Mild niacin deficiency has been shown to slow metabolism, causing decreased tolerance to cold.

Severe deficiency of niacin in the diet causes the disease [[pellagra]], which is characterized by diarrhea, dermatitis, and dementia, as well as [[Casal collar|Casal's necklace]] lesions on the lower neck, hyperpigmentation, thickening of the skin, inflammation of the mouth and tongue, digestive disturbances, amnesia, delirium, and eventually death, if left untreated.<ref name="Prakash 581–584">{{cite journal |vauthors=Prakash R, Gandotra S, Singh LK, Das B, Lakra A | title = Rapid resolution of delusional parasitosis in pellagra with niacin augmentation therapy | journal = General Hospital Psychiatry | volume = 30 | issue = 6 | pages = 581–4 | year = 2008 | pmid = 19061687 | doi = 10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2008.04.011 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6T70-4T24FKB-D/2/f619871a3d1f1d626b775c84523d6d94 }}</ref>  Common psychiatric symptoms of niacin deficiency include irritability, poor concentration, anxiety, fatigue, restlessness, apathy, and depression.<ref name="Prakash 581–584"/>  Studies have indicated that, in patients with alcoholic pellagra, niacin deficiency may be an important factor influencing both the onset and severity of this condition.  Patients with alcoholism typically experience increased [[intestinal permeability]], leading to negative health outcomes<!--(Junqueira-Franco et al., 2006)-->.

[[Hartnup disease]] is a [[hereditary]] nutritional disorder resulting in niacin deficiency.<ref name="Prakash 581–584"/>  This condition was first identified in the 1950s by the Hartnup family in London.  It is due to a deficit in the intestines and kidneys, making it difficult for the body to break down and absorb dietary [[tryptophan]] (an essential amino acid that is utilized to synthesize niacin).  The resulting condition is similar to pellagra, including symptoms of red, scaly rash, and sensitivity to sunlight.  Oral niacin is given as a treatment for this condition in doses ranging from 40–200&nbsp;mg, with a good prognosis if identified and treated early.<ref name="Prakash 581–584"/> Niacin synthesis is also deficient in [[carcinoid syndrome]], because of metabolic diversion of its precursor [[tryptophan]] to form [[serotonin]].

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===

Niacin's therapeutic effects are partly mediated through the activation of [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s, including [[niacin receptor 1]] (NIACR1) and [[niacin receptor 2]] (NIACR2) which are highly expressed in [[adipose tissue]], [[spleen]], [[immune cells]] and [[keratinocytes]] but not in other expected organs such as [[liver]], [[kidney]], [[heart]] or [[intestine]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Soga T, Kamohara M, Takasaki J, Matsumoto S, Saito T, Ohishi T, Hiyama H, Matsuo A, Matsushime H, Furuichi K | title = Molecular identification of nicotinic acid receptor | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 303 | issue = 1 | pages = 364–9 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12646212 | doi = 10.1016/S0006-291X(03)00342-5 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Wise A, Foord SM, Fraser NJ, Barnes AA, Elshourbagy N, Eilert M, Ignar DM, Murdock PR, Steplewski K, Green A, Brown AJ, Dowell SJ, Szekeres PG, Hassall DG, Marshall FH, Wilson S, Pike NB | title = Molecular identification of high and low affinity receptors for nicotinic acid | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 278 | issue = 11 | pages = 9869–74 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12522134 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M210695200 }}</ref> NIACR1 and NIACR2 inhibit [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate]] (cAMP) production and thus fat breakdown in [[adipose tissue]] and free [[fatty acids]] available for liver to produce [[triglycerides]] and  [[very-low-density lipoprotein]]s (VLDL) and consequently [[low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL) or "bad" cholesterol.<ref name="Gille, A. 2008">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gille A, Bodor ET, Ahmed K, Offermanns S | title = Nicotinic acid: Pharmacological effects and mechanisms of action | journal = Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology | volume = 48 | pages = 79–106 | year = 2008 | pmid = 17705685 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.48.113006.094746 | issue=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Wanders D, Judd RL | title = Future of GPR109A agonists in the treatment of dyslipidaemia | journal = Diabetes, obesity & metabolism | volume = 13 | issue = 8 | pages = 685–91 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21418500 | doi = 10.1111/j.1463-1326.2011.01400.x }}</ref> Decrease in free fatty acids also suppress hepatic expression of [[apolipoprotein C3]] (APOC3) and [[PPARGC1B|PPARg coactivator-1b]] (PGC-1b) thus increase VLDL turn over and reduce its production.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hernandez C, Molusky M, Li Y, Li S, Lin JD | title = Regulation of hepatic ApoC3 expression by PGC-1β mediates hypolipidemic effect of nicotinic acid | journal = Cell Metabolism | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 411–9 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20889132 | pmc = 2950832 | doi = 10.1016/j.cmet.2010.09.001 }}</ref> It also inhibits [[Diacylglycerol acyltransferase|diacylglycerol acyltransferase-2]] (important hepatic TG synthesis).

The mechanism behind increasing HDL is not totally understood but it seems to be done in various ways. Niacin increases [[apolipoprotein A1]] levels due to anti catabolic effects resulting in higher reverse cholesterol transport. It also inhibits HDL hepatic uptake, down-regulating production of the [[cholesterol ester transfer protein]] (CETP) gene.<ref name="Villines, T.

Research has been able to show the function of niacin in the pathway lipid metabolism. It is seen that this vitamin can decrease the synthesis of apoB-containing lipoproteins such as VLDL, LDL, IDL and Lipoprotein (a) via several mechanisms: (1) Directly inhibiting the action of DGAT2, a key enzyme for triglyceride synthesis; (2) It has the ability to bind to the receptor HCAR2 thereby decreasing lipolysis and FFA flux to the liver for triglyceride synthesis;[11] and (3) increased apoB catabolism. On the other hand, HDL cholesterol levels are increased by niacin through direct and indirect pathways. (4) Niacin decreases CETP mass and activity, and this synergistic effect with the decrease in triglyceride levels, can indirectly raise HDL cholesterol levels. The study has also been able to show direct effects on the beta chain of ATP synthase (5) and on production (6) and hepatic uptake (7) of apoA-I also increase HDL cholesterol levels. Thus by affecting the pathway reducing lipid levels help in reducing CVD.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Creider|first1=JC|last2=Hegele|first2=RA|last3=Joy|first3=TR|title=Niacin: another look at an underutilized lipid-lowering medication.|journal=Nature Reviews.

===Laboratory synthesis===
Several thousand tons of niacin are manufactured each year, starting from [[3-Methylpyridine|3-methylpyridine]].

==Preparations==
Niacin is available as a prescription product, and in the United States as a [[dietary supplement]]. Prescription products can be immediate release (Niacor, 500 mg tablets) or extended release (Niaspan, 500 and 1000 mg tablets). Dietary supplement products can be immediate or slow release, the latter including inositol hexanicotinate.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dunatchik|first=Andrew P.|last2=Ito|first2=Matthew K.|last3=Dujovne|first3=Carlos A.|date=2012-03-01|title=A systematic review on evidence of the effectiveness and safety of a wax-matrix niacin formulation|journal=Journal of Clinical Lipidology|volume=6|issue=2|pages=121–131|doi=10.1016/j.jacl.2011.07.003|issn=1933-2874|pmid=22385545}}</ref>

===Nicotinamide===
[[Nicotinamide]] may be obtained from the diet where it is present primarily as NAD+ and NADP+. These are hydrolysed in the intestine and the resulting nicotinamide is absorbed either as such, or following its hydrolysis to nicotinic acid. Nicotinamide is present in nature in only small amounts. In unprepared foods, niacin is present mainly in the form of the cellular pyridine nucleotides NAD and NADP. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the co-enzymes can occur during the course of food preparation. Boiling releases most of the total niacin present in sweet corn as nicotinamide (up to 55&nbsp;mg/kg).

Nicotinamide may be toxic to the liver at doses exceeding 3 g/day for adults.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Knip M, Douek IF, Moore WP, Gillmor HA, McLean AE, Bingley PJ, Gale EA | title = Safety of high-dose nicotinamide: a review | journal = Diabetologia | volume = 43 | issue = 11 | pages = 1337–45 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11126400 | doi = 10.1007/s001250051536 }}</ref>

==History==
Niacin was first described by chemist [[Hugo Weidel]] in 1873 in his studies of [[nicotine]].<ref>{{cite journal | first = H | last = Weidel | title = Zur Kenntniss des Nicotins | journal = [[Justus Liebigs Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie]] | year = 1873 | volume = 165 | pages = 330–349 | doi = 10.1002/jlac.18731650212 | issue = 2}}</ref>  The original preparation remains useful: the oxidation of [[nicotine]] using [[nitric acid]].<ref>{{OrgSynth | author = [[Samuel M.

Niacin was extracted from livers by biochemist [[Conrad Elvehjem]] in 1937, who later identified the active ingredient, then referred to as the "pellagra-preventing factor" and the "anti-blacktongue factor."<ref name=Elvehjem>{{cite journal |vauthors=Elvehjem CA, Madden RJ, Strongandd FM, Woolley DW |year=1938 |title=The isolation and identification of the anti-blacktongue factor J |journal = J.

Niacin is referred to as vitamin B<sub>3</sub> because it was the third of the [[B vitamins]] to be discovered. It has historically been referred to as "vitamin PP", "vitamin P-P" and "PP-factor", that are derived from the term "pellagra-preventive factor".<ref name="Pellagra And Its Prevention">{{cite web|title=Pellagra And Its Prevention And Control In Major Emergencies|url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/en/pellagra_prevention_control.pdf|website=World Health Organization|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref> When the biological significance of nicotinic acid was realized, it was thought appropriate to choose a name to dissociate it from nicotine, to avoid the perception that vitamins or niacin-rich food contains nicotine, or that cigarettes contain vitamins.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Niacin and Nicotinic Acid|date=March 7, 1942|volume=118|issue=10|doi=10.1001/jama.1942.02830100053014|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|page=823|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=254218|accessdate=May 7, 2016|publisher=American Medical Association}}</ref> The resulting name 'niacin' was derived from '''ni'''cotinic '''ac'''id + vitam'''in.'''<ref name="Pellagra And Its Prevention"/><ref>{{cite journal|title=Niacin and Niacin Amide|date=March 7, 1942|volume=118|issue=10|doi=10.1001/jama.1942.02830100049011|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|page=819|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=254210|accessdate=May 7, 2016|publisher=American Medical Association}}</ref>

Carpenter found in 1951 that niacin in corn is biologically unavailable, and can be released only in very alkaline [[Lime (material)|lime]] water of [[pH]] 11.<ref name="pmid14880960">{{cite journal |vauthors=Laguna J, Carpenter KJ | title = Raw versus processed corn in niacin-deficient diets | journal = J.

In 1955, Altschul and colleagues described niacin as having a lipid lowering property.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Altschul R, Hoffer A, Stephen JD | title = Influence of nicotinic acid on serum cholesterol in man | journal = Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics | volume = 54 | issue = 2 | pages = 558–9 | year = 1955 | pmid = 14350806 | doi = 10.1016/0003-9861(55)90070-9 }}</ref> As such, niacin is the oldest lipid lowering drug.

In animal models and in vitro, niacin produces marked anti-inflammatory effects in a variety of tissues&nbsp;– including the brain, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and [[Inflammation#Vascular component|vascular tissue]]&nbsp;– through the activation of [[NIACR1]].<ref name="Niacin neuroinflammation">{{cite journal | vauthors = Offermanns S, Schwaninger M | title = Nutritional or pharmacological activation of HCA(2) ameliorates neuroinflammation | journal = Trends Mol Med | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 245–255 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25766751 | doi = 10.1016/j.molmed.2015.02.002 | quote = Neuroinflammatory cells express HCA2, a receptor for the endogenous neuroprotective ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) as well as for the drugs dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and nicotinic acid, which have established efficacy in the treatment of MS and experimental stroke, respectively.
