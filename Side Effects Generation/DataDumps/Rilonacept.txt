'''Rilonacept''', also known as '''IL-1 Trap''' (marketed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals under the trade name '''Arcalyst'''), is an [[interleukin 1]] inhibitor.<ref>http://ard.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/ard.2009.108936v1?rss=1 "The IL-1 inhibitor rilonacept in treatment of chronic gouty arthritis: results of a placebo-controlled, monosequence crossover, nonrandomized, single-blind pilot study " Oct 2009</ref>

Rilonacept is a dimeric [[fusion protein]] consisting of the ligand-binding domains of the extracellular portions of the human interleukin-1 receptor component (IL-1R1) and IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) linked in-line to the fragment-crystallizable portion ([[Fc region]]) of human IgG1 that binds and neutralizes [[interleukin 1|IL-1]].<ref name="pmid18560622">{{cite journal | author = | title = Molecule of the month.

Rilonacept was given an "[[orphan drug]]" status by the [[United States]] [[Food and Drug Administration]] and is used for the treatment of [[cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome]]s (CAPS), including [[familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome]], [[Muckleâ€“Wells syndrome]] and [[neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease]] (It is not approved in the U.S. on this indication).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drugs.com/history/arcalyst.html |title=Arcalyst FDA Approval History - Drugs.com |accessdate=2012-05-08 |work= }}</ref>

On May 8th, 2012 an FDA Advisory Panel voted 11-0 against the approval of rilonacept for the treatment of [[gout]], stating that the benefits did not outweigh the risks associated with the drug.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/Rheumatology/GeneralRheumatology/32579 |title=Medical News: FDA Panel Nixes Gout Drug - in Rheumatology, General Rheumatology from MedPage Today |accessdate=2012-05-08 |work= }}</ref>
