It was developed in response to the growing rate of [[antibiotic resistance]] in bacteria such as ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', ''[[Acinetobacter baumannii]]'', and ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]''.<ref name="Rose-Rybak" /> As a tetracycline derivative antibiotic, its structural modifications has expanded its therapeutic activity to include Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, including those of multi-drug resistance.

Tigecycline is marketed by [[Pfizer]] under the brand name '''Tygacil.''' It was given a U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) fast-track approval and was approved on June 17, 2005.<ref name="Rose-Rybak" /><ref name="Kasbekar" />

==Medical uses==
Tigecycline is used to treat different kinds of bacterial infections, including complicated skin and structure infections, complicated intra-abdominal infections and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. The spectrum of activity of tigecycline is discussed below.
* Tigecycline can treat complicated skin and structure infections caused by; ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', vancomycin-susceptible ''[[Enterococcus faecalis]]'', [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (MRSA)]], ''[[Streptococcus agalactiae]]'', ''[[Streptococcus anginosus]]'' grp., ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'', ''[[Enterobacter cloacae]]'', ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'', and ''[[Bacteroides fragilis]]''.<ref name="Labeling">{{cite web|url = http://labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=491|title = TYGACIL U.S. Physician Prescribing Information|date = |accessdate = 2015-10-31|website = |publisher = Pfizer}}</ref> 
* Tigecycline is indicated for treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections caused by; ''[[Citrobacter freundii]]'', ''[[Enterobacter cloacae]]'', ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Klebsiella oxytoca]]'', ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'', vancomycin-susceptible ''[[Enterococcus faecalis]]'', [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (MRSA)]], ''[[Streptococcus anginosus]]'' grp., ''[[Bacteroides fragilis]]'', ''Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron'', ''Bacteroides uniformis'', ''Bacteroides vulgatus'', ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'', and ''Peptostreptococcus micros''.<ref name="Labeling"/>

Tigecycline is given intravenously and has activity against a variety of [[Gram-positive bacteria|Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] bacterial pathogens, many of which are resistant to existing antibiotics. Tigecycline successfully completed phase III trials in which it was at least equal to intravenous [[vancomycin]] and [[aztreonam]] to treat [[complicated skin and skin structure infection]]s, and to intravenous [[imipenem]] and cilastatian to treat [[complicated intra-abdominal infection]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid = 16249141|name-list-format = vanc|last1 = Scheinfeld|first1 = N|doi = 10.1080/09546630510011810|title = Tigecycline: a review of a new glycylcycline antibiotic.|journal = [[Journal of Dermatological Treatment]]|volume = 16|issue = 4|year = 2005|pages = 207–12}}</ref> Tigecycline is active against many [[Gram-positive]] bacteria, [[Gram-negative]] bacteria and anaerobes – including activity against [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA),  ''Stenotrophomonas maltophilia'', ''Haemophilus influenzae'', and ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'' (with [[Minimum inhibitory concentration|MIC]] values reported at 2&nbsp;µg/mL) and multi-drug resistant strains of ''[[Acinetobacter baumannii]]''. It has no activity against ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' spp. or ''[[Proteus (bacterium)|Proteus]]'' spp.  The drug is licensed for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections as well as intra-abdominal infections.

The European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection recommends tigecycline as a potential salvage therapy for severe and/or complicated or refractory ''Clostridium difficile'' infection.<ref name="Kaewpoowat">{{Cite journal|title = Tigecycline: a critical safety review|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1517/14740338.2015.997206|journal = Expert Opinion on Drug Safety|date = 2015-02-01|issn = 1474-0338|pmid = 25539800|pages = 335–342|volume = 14|issue = 2|doi = 10.1517/14740338.2015.997206|first = Quanhathai|last = Kaewpoowat|first2 = Luis|last2 = Ostrosky-Zeichner}}</ref>

Tigecycline can also be used in vulnerable populations such as immunocompromised patients or patients with cancer.<ref name="Kaewpoowat"/> Tigecycline may also have potential for use in [[acute myeloid leukemia]].<ref name="Skrtić20112">{{cite journal | last1 = Skrtić | first1 = M | last2 = Sriskanthadevan | first2 = S | last3 = Jhas | first3 = B | last4 = Gebbia | first4 = M | last5 = Wang | first5 = X | last6 = Wang | first6 = Z | last7 = Hurren | first7 = R | last8 = Jitkova | first8 = Y | last9 = Gronda | first9 = M | last10 = Maclean | first10 = N | last11 = Lai | first11 = CK | last12 = Eberhard | first12 = Y | last13 = Bartoszko | first13 = J | last14 = Spagnuolo | first14 = P | last15 = Rutledge | first15 = AC | last16 = Datti | first16 = A | last17 = Ketela | first17 = T | last18 = Moffat | first18 = J | last19 = Robinson | first19 = BH | last20 = Cameron | first20 = JH | last21 = Wrana | first21 = J | last22 = Eaves | first22 = CJ | last23 = Minden | first23 = MD | last24 = Wang | first24 = JC | last25 = Dick | first25 = JE | last26 = Humphries | first26 = K | last27 = Nislow | first27 = C | last28 = Giaever | first28 = G | last29 = Schimmer | first29 = AD | year = 2011 | title = Inhibition of mitochondrial translation as a therapeutic strategy for human acute myeloid leukemia | url = | journal = Cancer Cell | volume = 20 | issue = 5| pages = 674–688 | doi=10.1016/j.ccr.2011.10.015}}</ref>

===Susceptibility data===
Tigecycline targets both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria including a few key multi-drug resistant pathogens. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant bacterial pathogens.
* ''Escherichia coli'': 0.015 ''μ''g/mL — 4 ''μ''g/mL
* ''Klebsiella pneumoniae'': 0.06 ''μ''g/mL — 16 ''μ''g/mL
*  ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (methicillin-resistant): 0.03 ''μ''g/mL — 2 ''μ''g/mL<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toku-e.com/Assets/MIC/Tigecycline.pdf |format=PDF |title=Tigecycline : Susceptibility and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) Data |website=Toku-e.com |accessdate=2017-03-13}}</ref>

Tigecycline generally has poor activity against most strains of ''Pseudomonas''.<ref>Tygacil [package insert]. Philadelphia, PA: Wyeth Pharmaceuticals; 2005. Updated July 2010.</ref>

===Dosing===
Tigecycline is given by slow intravenous infusion (30 to 60 minutes) every 12 hours. People with impaired liver function need to be given a lower dose. No adjustment is needed for patients with impaired kidney function. It is not licensed for use in children. There is no oral form available.<ref name="Labeling"/>

=== Liver or kidney problems ===
Tigecycline does not require dose adjustment for people with mild to moderate liver problems. However, in people with severe liver problems dosing should be decreased and closely monitored.<ref name="Labeling"/>

Tigecycline does not require dose changes in people with poor kidney function or having [[hemodialysis]].<ref name="Labeling"/> 

=== Resistance mechanisms ===
Bacterial resistance towards tigecycline in Enterobacteriaceae (such as ''E. coli)'' is often caused by genetic mutations leading to an up-regulation of bacterial efflux pumps, such as the RND type efflux pump AcrAB. Some bacterial species such as ''Pseudomonas'' spp. can be naturally resistant to tigecycline through the constant over-expression of such efflux pumps. In some Enterobacteriaceae species, mutations in ribosomal genes such as ''rpsJ''&nbsp;have been found to cause resistance to tigecycline.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pournaras|first=Spyros|last2=Koumaki|first2=Vasiliki|last3=Spanakis|first3=Nicholas|last4=Gennimata|first4=Vasiliki|last5=Tsakris|first5=Athanassios|title=Current perspectives on tigecycline resistance in Enterobacteriaceae: susceptibility testing issues and mechanisms of resistance|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2016.04.017|journal=International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents|volume=48|issue=1|pages=11–18|doi=10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2016.04.017}}</ref> 

==Side effects==
As a tetracycline derivative, tigecycline exhibits similar [[Tetracycline|side effects]] to the class of antibiotics. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are the most common reported side effect.<ref name="Kaewpoowat"/>

Common side effects of tigecycline include nausea and vomiting.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://aac.asm.org/content/49/1/220.full.pdf+html|title = Pharmacokinetics of tigecycline after single and multiple doses in healthy subjects|last = Muralidharan|first = Gopal|date = January 2005|journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy|doi = 10.1128/aac.49.1.220-229.2005|pmid = 15616299|volume=49|pages=220–229|pmc=538906}}</ref> Nausea (26%) and vomiting (18%) tend to be mild or moderate and usually occur during the first two days of therapy.<ref name="FDA"/>

Rare adverse effects (<2%) include: swelling, pain, and irritation at injection site, anorexia, jaundice, hepatic dysfunction, pruritus, acute pancreatitis, and increased prothrombin time.<ref name="FDA" />

=== Precautions ===
Precaution is needed when taken in individuals with tetracycline hypersensitivity, pregnant women, and children. It has been found to cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy and therefore is classified as [[pregnancy category D]].<ref name="Labeling"/> In rats or rabbits, tigecycline crossed the placenta and was found in the fetal tissues, and is associated with slightly lower birth weights as well as slower bone ossification. Even though it was not considered teratogenic, tigecycline should be avoided unless benefits outweigh the risks.<ref name="FDA" /> In addition, its use during childhood can cause yellow-grey-brown discoloration of the teeth and should not be used unless necessary.

More so, there are clinical reports of tigecycline-induced [[acute pancreatitis]], with particular relevance to patients also diagnosed with [[cystic fibrosis]].<ref name="pmid262828382">{{cite journal|vauthors=Hemphill MT, Jones KR |title = Tigecycline-induced acute pancreatitis in a cystic fibrosis patient: A case report and literature review|journal = J Cyst Fibros|year = 2015|volume = 15|issue = 1|pages = e9–11|pmid = 26282838|doi = 10.1016/j.jcf.2015.07.008|pmc = |url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=26282838}}</ref>

Tigecycline showed an ''increased'' mortality in patients treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia (a non-approved use), but also in patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections, complicated intra-abdominal infections and diabetic foot infection.<ref name="FDA" /> Increased mortality was in comparison to other treatment of the same types of infections. The difference was not statistically significant for any type, but mortality was numerically greater for every infection type with Tigecycline treatment, and prompted a black box warning by the FDA.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm224370.htm |title=FDA Drug Safety Communication: Increased risk of death with Tygacil (tigecycline) compared to other antibiotics used to treat similar infections |website=Fda.gov |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2017-03-13}}</ref>

===Black box warning===
FDA issued a black box warning in September 2010 for tigecycline regarding an increased risk of death compared to other appropriate treatment.<ref name="FDA" /><ref name="Dixit">{{Cite journal|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1586/14787210.2014.894882|title = The role of tigecycline in the treatment of infections in light of the new black box warning|last = Dixit|first = Deepali|date = March 6, 2014|journal = Expert Review of Anti-infective Therapy|doi = 10.1586/14787210.2014.894882|pmid = 24597542|access-date =|volume=12|issue = 4|pages=397–400}}</ref> As a result of increase in total death rate (cause is unknown) in individuals taking this drug, tigecycline is reserved for situations in which alternative treatment is not suitable.<ref name="Labeling" /><ref name="Dixit" />

In 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updated the warnings section of the drug label to include information regarding increased mortality risk (seen most clearly in people treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia).

=== Drug interactions ===
Tigecycline has been found to interact with medications, such as:
* [[Warfarin]]: Since both tigecycline and warfarin bind to serum or plasma proteins, there is potential for protein-binding interactions, such that one drug will have more effect than the other. Although dose adjustment is not necessary, INR and prothrombin time should be monitored if given concurrently.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Evaluation of a Potential Tigecycline-Warfarin Drug Interaction|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1592/phco.28.7.895/abstract|journal = Pharmacotherapy: the Journal of Human Pharmacology and Drug Therapy|date = 2008-07-01|issn = 1875-9114|pages = 895–905|volume = 28|issue = 7|doi = 10.1592/phco.28.7.895|language = en|first = James J.|last = Zimmerman|first2 = Donald G.|last2 = Raible|first3 = Dawn M.|last3 = Harper|first4 = Kyle|last4 = Matschke|first5 = John L.|last5 = Speth}}</ref>
* [[Oral contraceptive pill|Oral contraceptives]]: Effectiveness of oral contraceptives are decreased with concurrent use due to reduction in the concentration levels of oral contraceptives.  
However, the mechanism behind these drug interactions have not been fully analyzed.<ref name="FDA" />

==Mechanism of action==
Tigecycline is [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]] that acts as a [[protein synthesis inhibitor]]. It exhibits bacteriostatic activity by binding to the [[30S ribosomal subunit]] of bacteria and thereby blocking the interaction of [[aminoacyl-tRNA]] with the A site of the ribosome.<ref>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/557981_2 Tigecycline: A Novel Broad-Spectrum Antimicrobial: Pharmacology and Mechanism of Action] Christine M. Slover, PharmD, Infectious Diseases Fellow, Keith A. Rodvold, PharmD and Larry H. Danziger, PharmD, Professor, Department of Pharmacy Practice, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL</ref> In addition, tigecycline has demonstrated bactericidal activity against isolates of ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae|S. pneumoniae]]'' and ''[[Legionella pneumophila|L. pneumophila]].''<ref name="FDA"/>

It is a third generation [[Tetracycline antibiotics|tetracycline]] derivative within a class called [[glycylcyclines]] which carry a ''N'',''N''-dimethyglycylamido (DMG) moiety attached to the 9-position of tetracycline ring D.<ref name="Nguyen">{{Cite journal|title = Tetracycline antibiotics and resistance mechanisms|last = Nguyen|first = Fabian|date = May 2014|journal = Biol Chem|doi = 10.1515/hsz-2013-0292|pmid = |access-date = November 2, 2015|volume=395|issue = 5}}</ref> With structural modifications as a 9-DMG derivative of [[minocycline]], tigecycline has been found to improve minimal inhibitory concentrations against Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms, when compared to tetracyclines.<ref name="Nguyen" />

==Pharmacokinetics==
Tigecycline is metabolized through glucuronidation into glucuronid conjugates and ''N''-acetyl-9-aminominocycline metabolite.<ref name="Hoffman"/> Therefore, dose adjustments are needed for patients with severe hepatic impairment.<ref name="FDA"/> More so, it is primarily eliminated unchanged in the feces and secondarily eliminated by the kidneys.<ref name="Hoffman" /> No renal adjustments are necessary.

==Society and culture==

===Approval===
It is approved to treat complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI), complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI), and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CAP) in individuals 18 years and older.<ref name="Rose-Rybak" /><ref name="Kasbekar" /><ref name="Hoffman">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Metabolism, Excretion, and Pharmacokinetics of [14C]Tigecycline, a First-In-Class Glycylcycline Antibiotic, after Intravenous Infusion to Healthy Male Subjects|last = Hoffman|first = Matthew|date = May 25, 2007|journal = Drug Metabolism and Disposition|doi = 10.1124/dmd.107.015735|pmid = |access-date =|volume=35|issue = 9|pages=1543–1553}}</ref><ref name="FDA">{{cite web|url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2010/021821s021lbl.pdf|title = Food and Drug Administration, TYGACIL® (tigecycline) FOR INJECTION for intravenous use Prescribing Information|website = FDA U.S. Food and Drug Administration|publisher = U.S. Department of Health & Human Services|last = Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc.|page = 16}}</ref>
