<!-- Definition and medical uses -->
'''Ketorolac''', sold under the brand name '''Toradol''' among others, is a [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] (NSAID) in the family of [[Heterocyclic compound|heterocyclic]] [[acetic acid]] [[derivative (chemistry)|derivative]]s, used as an [[analgesic]].<ref name=Vallertand/><ref name=PDR>{{cite book | title = [[Physicians' Desk Reference| Physician's Desk Reference 2017]] | pages = S-474-5|publisher = PDR, LLC| location = Montvale, New Jersey | year = 2017 | isbn = 9781563638381}}</ref> It is considered a first-generation NSAID.{{sfn | Henry |page = 279}}

<!-- Side effect and mechanisms -->
Ketorolac acts by [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibiting]] the [[Biosynthesis|bodily synthesis]] of [[prostaglandin]]s. Ketorolac in its oral ([[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablet]] or [[Capsule (pharmacy)|capsule]]) and [[Intramuscular injection|intramuscular]] ([[Injection (medicine)|injected]]) preparations is a [[racemic mixture]] of both (''S'')-(−)-ketorolac, the active [[isomer]], and (''R'')-(+)-ketorolac.{{sfn | Henry |page = 279}}

<!-- History and culture -->
Ketorolac was developed in 1989 by [[Syntex]] Corp.

Ketorolac is used for short-term [[pain]] control not lasting longer than five days, and can be administered [[oral medication|orally]], by intramuscular injection, intravenously, and by [[nasal spray]].<ref name=Vallertand/>  Ketorolac is initially administered by intramuscular injection or intravenously. Oral therapy is only used as a continuation from the intramuscular or intravenous starting point.<ref name=Vallertand/><ref name="MartinJimenez2017"/>

During treatment with ketorolac, clinicians monitor for the manifestation of adverse effects and side effects. Lab tests, such as [[liver function tests]], bleeding time, [[BUN]], [[serum creatinine]] and electrolyte levels are often used and help to identify potential complications.<ref name=Vallertand/><ref name=PDR/>

==Contraindications==
Ketorolac is [[Contraindication|contraindicated]] in those with [[hypersensitivity]], allergies to the medication, cross-sensitivity to other NSAIDs, prior to surgery, history of peptic ulcer disease, gastrointestinal bleeding, alcohol intolerance, renal impairment, cerebrovascular bleeding, [[nasal polyps]], [[angioedema]], and [[bronchospasm|asthma]].<ref name=Vallertand/><ref name=PDR/>

Recommendations exist for cautious use of ketorolac in those who have experienced [[cardiovascular disease]], myocardial infarction, stroke, [[heart failure]], [[coagulation]] disorders, [[renal impairment]], and 
[[hepatic impairment]].<ref name=Vallertand/><ref name=PDR/>

==Adverse effects==
Though uncommon, potentially fatal adverse effects are [[stroke]], [[myocardial infarction]], [[GI bleeding]], [[Stevens-Johnson Syndrome]], [[Toxic epidermal necrolysis]] and [[anaphylaxis]]. A less serious and more common (>10%) side effect is [[drowsiness]]. Infrequent (<1%) side effects are [[paresthesia]], prolonged [[bleeding time]], [[intramuscular injection|injection]] site pain, [[purpura]], [[sweat]]ing, [[Thought|abnormal thinking]], increased [[tearing]] (eyes), [[edema]], [[pallor]], [[dry mouth]], [[Flavor|abnormal taste]], [[urinary frequency]] [[Liver function tests|increased liver enzymes]], [[itching]] and others. Ketorolac can cause premature constriction of the [[ductus arteriosis]] in an infant during the third trimester of pregnancy.<ref name=Vallertand/><ref name=PDR/> The practice of restricting treatment with ketorolac is due to its potential to cause kidney damage.{{sfn | Henry |page = 280}} Platelet function is decreased related to the use of ketorolac.{{sfn | Henry |page = 279}}

== Interactions ==
Ketorolac can interact with other medications. [[Probenecid]] can increase the probability of having an [[adverse reaction]] or experiencing a [[side effect]] when taken with ketorolac. [[Pentoxifylline]] can increase the risk of bleeding. When aspirin is taken at the same time as ketorolac, the effectiveness is decreased. Problematic GI effects are additive and become more likely if potassium supplements, aspirin, other NSAIDS, [[corticosteroids]], or alcohol is taken at the same time. The effectiveness of antihypertensives and diuretics can be lowered.  The use of ketorolac can increase serum lithium levels to the point of toxicity. Toxicity to methotrexate is more likely if ketorolac is taken at the same time. The risk of bleeding increases with the concurrent medications [[clopidogrel]], [[cefoperazone]], [[valproic acid]], [[cefotetan]], [[eptifibatide]], [[tirofiban]], and [[copidine]]. Anticoagulants and thrombolytic medications also increase the likelihood of bleeding. Medications used to treat cancer can interact with ketorolac along with radiation therapy. The risk of toxicity to the kidneys increases when ketorolac is taken with [[cyclosporine]].<ref name=Vallertand/><ref name=PDR/>

Interactions with ketorolac exist with some [[herbal supplement]]s. ''[[Panax ginseng]]'', [[clove]], [[ginger]], [[arnica]], [[feverfew]], [[dong quai]], [[chamomile]], and ''[[Ginkgo biloba]]'', increases the risk of bleeding.<ref name=Vallertand/><ref name=PDR/>

==Mechanism of action==
The primary [[mechanism of action]] responsible for ketorolac's anti-inflammatory, [[antipyretic]] and analgesic effects is the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by competitive blocking of the [[enzyme]] [[cyclooxygenase]] (COX). Ketorolac is a non-selective COX inhibitor.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1= Lee |first1= I.

== History ==
In the US, ketorolac was the only widely available intravenous NSAID for many years; an IV form of [[paracetemol]] became available in Europe in 2009 and then in the US.<ref name="MartinJimenez2017"/>

The [[Syntex]] company, of [[Palo Alto, California]] developed the ophthalmic solution Acular around 2006.

In 2007 there were concerns about the high incidence of reported side effects. This led to restriction in its dosage and maximum duration of use. In the UK, treatment was initiated only in a hospital. Dosing guidelines were published at this time.<ref>MHRA Drug Safety Update October 2007, Volume 1, Issue 3, pp 3-4.</ref>

Concerns over the high incidence of reported side effects with ketorolac trometamol led to its withdrawal (apart from the ophthalmic formulation) in several countries, while in others its permitted dosage and maximum duration of treatment have been reduced. From 1990 to 1993, 97 reactions with a fatal outcome were reported worldwide.<ref>Committee on the Safety of Medicines, Medicines Control Agency: Ketorolac: new restrictions on dose and duration of treatment. ''Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance:'' June 1993; '''Volume 19''' (pages 5-8).</ref>
