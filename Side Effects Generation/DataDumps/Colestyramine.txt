'''Colestyramine''' ([[International nonproprietary name|INN]]) or '''cholestyramine''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]) (trade names '''Questran''', '''Questran Light''', '''Cholybar''', '''Olestyr''') is a [[bile acid sequestrant]], which binds [[bile]] in the [[gastrointestinal tract]] to prevent its reabsorption. It is a strong [[ion exchange resin]], which means it can exchange its [[chloride]] [[anion]]s with anionic [[bile acid]]s in the gastrointestinal tract and bind them strongly in the resin matrix. The functional group of the anion exchange resin is a [[quaternary ammonium|quaternary]] [[ammonium group]] attached to an inert [[styrene]]-[[divinylbenzene]] [[copolymer]].

Colestyramine removes bile acids from the body by forming [[insoluble]] complexes with bile acids in the [[intestine]], which are then excreted in the [[feces]].<ref name=livertox/> As a result of this loss of bile acids, more [[blood plasma|plasma]] [[cholesterol]] is converted to bile acids in the liver to normalise levels.<ref name=livertox>http://livertox.nih.gov/Cholestyramine.htm, [[United States National Institutes of Health]] (page visited on 22 June 2016).</ref> This conversion of cholesterol into bile acids lowers [[plasma cholesterol level]]s.<ref name=livertox/>

==Medical uses==
Bile acid sequestrants such as colestyramine were first used to treat [[hypercholesterolemia]], but since the introduction of [[statin]]s, now have only a minor role for this indication.  They can also be used to treat the [[pruritus]], or itching, that often occurs during [[liver failure]] and other types of [[cholestasis]] where the ability to eliminate bile acids is reduced.

Colestyramine is commonly used to treat [[diarrhea]] resulting from [[bile acid malabsorption]].<ref name="pmid24602022">{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilcox C, Turner J, Green J |title=Systematic review: the management of chronic diarrhoea due to bile acid malabsorption |journal=Aliment.

When this section is removed, the bile acids pass into the large bowel and cause diarrhea due to stimulation of chloride/fluid secretion by the colonocytes resulting in a secretory diarrhea. Colestyramine prevents this increase in water by making the bile acids insoluble and osmotically inactive.

Colestyramine is also used in the control of other types of [[bile acid diarrhea]]. The primary, idiopathic form of bile acid diarrhea is a common cause of chronic functional diarrhea, often misdiagnosed as diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D), and most of these patients respond to colestyramine.<ref name="pmid19570102">{{cite journal |vauthors=Wedlake L, A'Hern R, Russell D, Thomas K, Walters JR, Andreyev HJ |title=Systematic review: the prevalence of idiopathic bile acid malabsorption as diagnosed by SeHCAT scanning in patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome |journal=Aliment.

Colestyramine can be helpful in the treatment of ''[[Clostridium difficile colitis|Clostridium difficile]]'' infections, to absorb toxins A and B, and reduce the diarrhea and the other symptoms these toxins cause. However, because it is not an anti-infective, it is used in concert with [[vancomycin]].<ref name="pmid15149585">{{cite journal |author=Stroehlein JR |title=Treatment of Clostridium difficile Infection |journal=Curr Treat Options Gastroenterol |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=235–239 |date=June 2004  |pmid=15149585 |doi= 10.1007/s11938-004-0044-y|url=}}</ref>

It is also used in the "wash out" procedure in patients taking [[leflunomide]] or teriflunomide to aid drug elimination in the case of drug discontinuation due to severe side effects caused by leflunomide or teriflunomide.<ref name="pmid19955995">{{cite journal |vauthors=Wong SP, Chu CM, Kan CH, Tsui HS, Ng WL |title=Successful treatment of leflunomide-induced acute pneumonitis with cholestyramine wash-out therapy |journal=J Clin Rheumatol |volume=15 |issue=8 |pages=389–92 |date=December 2009  |pmid=19955995 |doi=10.1097/RHU.0b013e3181c3f87e |url=}}</ref>

Ointments containing colestyramine compounded with [[aquaphor]] have been used in topical treatment of diaper rash in infants and toddlers.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=White CM, Gailey RA, Lippe S | title=Cholestyramine ointment to treat buttocks rash and anal excoriation in an infant. | journal=Ann Pharmacother | year= 1996 | volume= 30 | issue= 9 | pages= 954–6 | pmid=8876854 | doi= | pmc= | url=  }}</ref>

Cholestyramine also binds with oxalate in the GI tract, ultimately reducing urine oxalate and calcium oxalate stone formation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/kidney-stones/medications.html}}</ref>

==Available forms==
Colestyramine is available as powder form, in 4-g packets, or in larger canisters.  In the [[United States]], it can be purchased either as a generic medicine, or as Questran or Questran Light ([[Bristol-Myers Squibb]]).

==Dosage==
A typical dose is 4 to 8 g once or twice daily, with a maximum dose of 24 g/d.

== Side effects ==

These side effects have been noted:<ref name="Questran"/>  
* Most frequent: [[constipation]]
* Increased plasma triglycerides<ref>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|003493|Triglyceride level}}</ref>

[[Intestinal obstruction]] has been reported in patients with previous bowel surgery who should use colestyramine cautiously.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Merten |first1=DF |last2=Grossman |first2=H |title=Intestinal obstruction associated with cholestyramine therapy |journal=American Journal of Roentgenology |volume=134 |issue=4 |pages=827–8 |year=1980 |pmid=6767374 |doi=10.2214/ajr.134.4.827 }}</ref>

Patients with [[hypothyroidism]], [[diabetes]], [[nephrotic syndrome]], dysproteinemia, obstructive liver disease, [[kidney disease]], or [[alcoholism]] should consult their doctor before taking this medication.<ref name="Questran"/> Other drugs should be taken at least one hour before or four to six hours after colestyramine to reduce possible interference with absorption.  Patients with [[phenylketonuria]] should consult with a physician before taking Questran Light because that product contains [[phenylalanine]].

== Drug interactions ==
Interactions with these drugs have been noted:<ref name="Questran"/>
*[[Digitalis]]
*[[Estrogens]] and [[progestins]] 
*Oral [[diabetes]] drugs 
*[[Penicillin#Benzylpenicillin .28penicillin G.29|Penicillin G]] 
*[[Phenobarbital]] 
*[[Spironolactone]] 
*[[Tetracycline]] 
*[[Thiazide]]-type diuretic pills 
*[[Thyroid]] medication 
*[[Warfarin]] 
*[[Leflunomide]]

Most interactions are due to the risk of decreased absorption of these drugs.<ref name="pmid17368279"/>  The duration of treatment is not limited, but the prescribing physician should reassess at regular intervals if continued treatment is still necessary. The principal overdose risk is blockage of intestine or stomach.

Colestyramine may interfere in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamins [[Vitamin A|A]], [[Vitamin D|D]], [[Vitamin E|E]], and [[Vitamin K|K]]. No special considerations regarding alcohol consumption are made.<ref name="Questran">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdrhealth.com/drugs/questran |title=Questran |work=PDRHealth |accessdate=July 7, 2012}}</ref>
