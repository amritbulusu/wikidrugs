'''Tiapride'''  is a drug that selectively blocks D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> [[dopamine]] receptors in the brain. It is used to treat a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders including [[dyskinesia]], [[alcohol withdrawal syndrome]], negative symptoms of [[psychosis]], and agitation and aggression in the elderly.<ref name=scatton>{{cite journal|last=Scatton|first=B|author2=Cohen, C |author3=Perrault, G |author4=Oblin, A |author5=Claustre, Y |author6=Schoemaker, H |author7=Sanger, DJ |author8=Rouquier, L |author9= Porsolt, R  |title=The preclinical pharmacologic profile of tiapride.|journal=European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists|date=January 2001|volume=16 Suppl 1|pages=29s-34s|pmid=11520476 |doi=10.1016/s0924-9338(00)00526-5}}</ref> A derivative of [[benzamide]], tiapride is chemically and functionally similar to other benzamide [[antipsychotics]] such as [[sulpiride]] and [[amisulpride]] known for their [[dopamine antagonist]] effects.

==Medical uses==

===Alcoholism===
Research in animal models and clinical studies in [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] patients have found that tiapride has [[anxiolytic]] effects. Dopamine hyperactivity has been linked with [[alcohol withdrawal syndrome]] (AWS), suggesting that tiapride's antidopaminergic effects are the most likely mechanism for its clinical efficacy,<ref name=martinotti>{{cite journal|pmid=20078487 | doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02792.x | volume=105 | issue=2 | title=Pregabalin, tiapride and lorazepam in alcohol withdrawal syndrome: a multi-centre, randomized, single-blind comparison trial |date=February 2010 | pages=288–99 | journal=Addiction}}</ref> although others believe some other mechanism might be involved.<ref name=peters /> Alcoholic patients treated with tiapride at a dosage of 300&nbsp;mg/day reported reduced psychological distress and improved abstinence from alcohol.<ref name=peters /> In another study in which alcoholic patients were given titrated doses up to 800&nbsp;mg/day, subjects showed significant improvements in ratings of withdrawal, craving, psychiatric symptoms and quality of life.<ref name=martinotti />

While tiapride does not affect [[positive symptoms]] of psychosis such as [[hallucinosis]] or [[delirium]] sometimes manifested in alcohol withdrawal syndrome, if combined with a drug such as [[carbamazepine]] that addresses those symptoms, it is ideal for treating alcohol dependency because its metabolism does not depend on liver function and it has low potential for abuse.<ref name=martinotti /> This sets it apart from the [[benzodiazepines]], which are contraindicated with alcohol and can be addictive.<ref name=peters /> Moreover, tiapride's rapid onset makes intravenous or intramuscular injection prior to or during withdrawal episodes particularly effective.<ref name=martinotti />

===Agitation and aggression===
Agitation and aggression are also associated with hyperdopaminergic activity. Antipsychotic drugs are the most common treatment for these symptoms, but often come with a host of side-effects including [[orthostatic hypotension]] and deficits in vigilance and attention. One clinical study in agitated elderly patients compared the effects of tiapride, haloperidol and [[placebo]] and found that while the two drugs had comparable efficacy superior to the placebo effect, tiapride had fewer and less severe side effects than haloperidol.<ref name=robert>{{cite journal|last=Robert|first=PH|author2=Allain, H |title=Clinical management of agitation in the elderly with tiapride.|journal=European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists|date=January 2001|volume=16 Suppl 1|pages=42s-47s|pmid=11520478|doi=10.1016/s0924-9338(00)00527-7}}</ref>

Tiapride's selectivity for the limbic system, which is associated with emotion, could underlie its particular efficacy in treating these affective disorders. Moreover, its selectivity for the dopaminergic system is thought to account for its avoidance of the side effects  typically associated with other neuroleptic drugs, such as [[chlorpromazine]], which act on a number of neurotransmitter systems.<ref name=scatton />

===Movement disorders===
While tiapride preferentially targets the limbic system over the striatum, its moderate antagonistic effect on striatal dopamine receptors makes it effective in treating motor deficits that involve this area, such as [[tardive dyskinesia]] and [[chorea]]. Tiapride's moderate efficacy at D<sub>2</sub> receptors<ref name=dose /> may explain why it is able to treat motor symptoms without the extrapyramidal symptoms caused by excess dopamine blockage, which are sometimes seen in haloperidol or chlorpromazine. One clinical study of patients with tardive dyskinesia associated with [[Parkinson's disease]] found that tiapride significantly improved motor abilities without affecting other parkinsonian symptoms.<ref name=perenyi>{{cite journal|last=Perényi|first=A|author2=Arató, M |author3=Bagdy, G |author4=Frecska, E |author5= Szücs, R |title=Tiapride in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia: a clinical and biochemical study.|journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|date=June 1985|volume=46|issue=6|pages=229–31|pmid=2860098}}</ref>

==Side effects==
Although it is considered a "safe" medicine, it is, like sulpiride, strictly contraindicated for patients under the age of 18 due to its effects during the process of puberty. This is likely related to its side effects on levels of the hormone prolactin, which is involved in sexual development.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sanford|first=LM|author2=Baker, SJ |title=Prolactin regulation of testosterone secretion and testes growth in DLS rams at the onset of seasonal testicular recrudescence.|journal=Reproduction (Cambridge, England)|date=January 2010|volume=139|issue=1|pages=197–207|pmid=19755483|doi=10.1530/REP-09-0180}}</ref> There are also insufficient clinical data on the other side effects in adolescents.

Tiapride has been found to cause [[Hyperprolactinaemia|excess prolactin]] levels in plasma,<ref name=perenyi /> which can cause decreased [[libido]], [[infertility]] and increased risk of [[breast cancer]].<ref name=AET>{{cite web|title=Tiacob: Summary of Product Characteristics|publisher=A.E. Tiefenbacher|accessdate=22 October 2012|year=2006}}</ref> This is because dopamine plays a primary role in regulating prolactin release by binding to D<sub>2</sub> receptors on [[Prolactin cell|prolactin-secreting cells]] in the anterior pituitary.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fitzgerald|first=P|author2=Dinan, TG |title=Prolactin and dopamine: what is the connection? A review article.|journal=Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)|date=March 2008|volume=22|issue=2 Suppl|pages=12–9|pmid=18477617|doi=10.1177/0269216307087148}}</ref> Thus, when tiapride blocks these receptors these cells are disinhibited and release more prolactin.

The side-effect reported most commonly to the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) is [[rhabdomyolysis]], a condition characterized by muscle tissue breakdown.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tiapride Hydrochloride|url=http://www.drugcite.com/?q=TIAPRIDE%20HYDROCHLORIDE|publisher=DrugCite|accessdate=30 October 2012}}</ref> Cardiac abnormalities such as prolongation of the [[QT interval]] and [[torsades de pointes]] have also been observed.<ref name=AET />

Dosages above approximately 300&nbsp;mg/day risk inducing tardive dyskinesia.<ref name=peters /> However, given the drug's fairly wide window of tolerable doses,<ref name=scatton /> dosages can often be titrated to obtain the desired effect without bringing about motor deficits. In general, tiapride is considered an [[atypical antipsychotic]] because of its low risk for [[extrapyramidal symptoms]], such as [[akinesia]] and [[akathesia]]. These effects are thought to be reduced in tiapride relative to [[typical antipsychotics]] because of its selectivity for the limbic system over extrapyramidal areas that control movement.<ref name=scatton />

==Pharmacodynamics==
Tiapride is a dopamine D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist. It is more selective than other [[neuroleptic]] drugs such as [[haloperidol]] and [[risperidone]], which not only target four of the five known dopamine receptor subtypes (D<sub>1-4</sub>), but also block [[Serotonin receptor|serotonin]] (5-HT<sub>2A, 2C</sub>), α<sub>1</sub>- and α<sub>2</sub>-[[Adrenergic receptor|adrenergic]], and [[Histamine receptor|histamine]] H1 receptors.<ref name=scatton /> Compared to these drugs, tiapride has a relatively moderate [[Potency (pharmacology)|affinity]] for its target receptors, displacing 50 percent of <sup>3</sup>H-[[raclopride]] binding at a concentration of 320 nM at D<sub>2</sub> receptors and a concentration of 180 nM at D<sub>3</sub> receptors.

Tiapride displays a relatively high regional selectivity for [[Limbic system|limbic]] areas. One study found that, in contrast with haloperidol, which displays equal affinity for receptors in the rat limbic system and striatum, tiapride shows over three times as much affinity for limbic areas than striatal areas.<ref name=scatton /> Another study in rats found tiapride's affinity for the septum, a limbic region, to be over thirty times as high as for the striatum.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bischoff|first=S|author2=Bittiger, H |author3=Delini-Stula, A |author4= Ortmann, R |title=Septo-hippocampal system: target for substituted benzamides.|journal=European Journal of Pharmacology|date=Apr 23, 1982|volume=79|issue=3-4|pages=225–32|pmid=7201401|doi=10.1016/0014-2999(82)90628-8}}</ref>

Efficacy at the D<sub>2</sub> receptor is moderate, with 80 percent of receptors occupied even in the presence of excess tiapride concentrations.<ref name=dose>{{cite journal|last=Dose|first=M|author2=Lange, HW |title=The benzamide tiapride: treatment of extrapyramidal motor and other clinical syndromes.|journal=Pharmacopsychiatry|date=January 2000|volume=33|issue=1|pages=19–27|pmid=10721880|doi=10.1055/s-2000-7964}}</ref>

==Pharmacokinetics==
Tiapride is primarily taken orally in the form of a tablet, but can also be administered via intravenous or intramuscular injection.<ref name=peters>{{cite journal|last=Peters|first=DH|author2=Faulds, D |title=Tiapride. A review of its pharmacology and therapeutic potential in the management of alcohol dependence syndrome.|journal=Drugs|date=June 1994|volume=47|issue=6|pages=1010–32|pmid=7521826|doi=10.2165/00003495-199447060-00009}}</ref> A liquid oral formulation is also available for elderly patients with difficulty chewing solids.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Canal|first=M|author2=Desanti, CR |author3=Santoni, JP |title=A new oral formulation of tiapride (drops): pharmacokinetic profile and therapeutic applications.|journal=Clinical drug investigation|year=1998|volume=15|issue=5|pages=455–60|pmid=18370501|doi=10.2165/00044011-199815050-00010}}</ref> For all three methods of administration, the [[bioavailability]] of tiapride is approximately 75 percent. Peak plasma concentrations are attained between 0.4 and 1.5 hours following administration, and steady-state concentrations achieved 24 to 48 hours after beginning administration 3 times a day. It distributes rapidly and exhibits virtually no binding to plasma proteins, giving it a relatively high volume of distribution. Benzamide and its derivatives are highly water-soluble, and because of their polarity are believed to cross the blood–brain barrier via carrier-mediated transport.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Härtter|first=S |author2=Hüwel, S |author3=Lohmann, T |author4=Abou El Ela, A |author5=Langguth, P |author6=Hiemke, C |author7=Galla, HJ |title=How does the benzamide antipsychotic amisulpride get into the brain?--An in vitro approach comparing amisulpride with clozapine.|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|date=November 2003|volume=28|issue=11|pages=1916–22|pmid=12865899|doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1300244}}</ref> Elimination of tiapride, mostly in its original form, occurs through renal excretion with a half-life of 3 to 4 hours.<ref name=peters />

Recommended dosages of tiapride vary with clinical symptoms. In alcoholic patients, delirium or pre-delirium associated with alcohol withdrawal can be alleviated by administration of 400–1200&nbsp;mg/day or up to 1800&nbsp;mg/day if necessary. Tremors and other dyskinsias can be treated with 300–800&nbsp;mg/day. For reducing agitation and aggression in elderly patients, 200–300&nbsp;mg/day is recommended.<ref name=peters />

==Availability==
Tiapride is marketed under various trade names and is widely available outside of the [[United States]]. The most common trade name for tiapride is '''Tiapridal''', which is used throughout [[Europe]], [[Russia]], as well as parts of [[South America]], the [[Middle East]], and [[North Africa]]. It is also sold under different names in [[Italy]] (Italprid, Sereprile), [[Japan]] (Tialaread, Tiaryl, Tiaprim, Tiaprizal), [[Chile]] (Sereprid), [[Germany]] (Tiaprid, Tiapridex), and [[China]] (Tiapride).<ref>{{cite web|title=Tiapride Generic|url=http://www.igenericdrugs.com/gd.cgi?notran=1&s=tiapride&search=SEARCH|publisher=Generic Drugs|accessdate=30 October 2012}}</ref>
