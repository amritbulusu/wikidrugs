Ganaxolone is being investigated for potential medical use in the treatment of [[epilepsy]].

== Mechanism of action ==
The exact mechanism of action for ganaxolone is unknown; however, results from animal studies suggest that it acts by blocking seizure propagation and elevating seizure thresholds.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":3"/>

Ganaxolone is thought to modulate both [[synapse|synaptic]] and extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors to normalize over-excited [[neuron]]s.<ref name=":0" /> Ganaxolone's activation of the extrasynaptic receptor is an additional mechanism that provides stabilizing effects that potentially differentiates it from other drugs that increase GABA signaling.<ref name=":0" />

Ganaxolone binds to allosteric sites of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor to modulate and open the [[Chloride channel|chloride ion channel]], resulting in a [[Hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarization]] of the neuron.<ref name=":0" /> This causes an inhibitory effect on [[neurotransmission]], reducing the chance of a successful [[action potential]] ([[depolarization]]) from occurring.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":3"/>

== Clinical trials ==
The most common adverse events reported across clinical trials have been [[somnolence]] (sleepiness), [[dizziness]], and [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]].<ref name=":7" /> In 2015, the [[MIND Institute|MIND Institute at the University of California, Davis]], announced that it was conducting, in collaboration with Marinus Pharmaceuticals, a randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the effect of ganaxolone on behaviors associated with [[Fragile X syndrome]] in children and adolescents.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/mindinstitute/research/fragilex/pdf/summary_of_studies.pdf|title = Fragile X Research and Treatment Center: Clinical Research Studies|date = 10 February 2015|access-date = 27 January 2016|website = UC Davis MIND Institute|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01725152?term=A+Controlled+Double-Blind+Cross-over+Trial+of+Ganaxolone+in+Children+with+Fragile+X+Syndrome&rank=1|title = Ganaxolone Treatment in Children With Fragile X Syndrome|date = 7 November 2012|access-date = 27 January 2016|website = Clinicaltrials.gov|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref><ref name=":8">{{Cite web|url = http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/publish/news/newsroom/4974|title = UC Davis Health System.
