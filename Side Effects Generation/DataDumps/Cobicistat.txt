'''Cobicistat''', with trade name  '''Tybost''' (formerly '''GS-9350''') is a licensed drug for use in the treatment of [[human immunodeficiency virus]] infection ([[HIV/AIDS]]). Its major mechanism of action is through the inhibition of human [[CYP3A]] proteins.<ref>{{cite journal| pmid=20043009 | doi=10.1038/clpt.2009.228 | volume=87 | title=Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of GS-9350: a novel pharmacokinetic enhancer without anti-HIV activity | year=2010 | journal=Clin Pharmacol Ther | pages=322–9 | last1 = Mathias | first1 = AA | last2 = German | first2 = P | last3 = Murray | first3 = BP | last4 = Wei | first4 = L | last5 = Jain | first5 = A | last6 = West | first6 = S | last7 = Warren | first7 = D | last8 = Hui | first8 = J | last9 = Kearney | first9 = BP}}</ref>

Like [[ritonavir]] (Norvir), cobicistat is of interest for its ability to inhibit liver enzymes that [[Metabolism|metabolize]] other medications used to treat HIV, notably [[elvitegravir]], an HIV [[integrase inhibitor]]. By combining cobicistat with elvitegravir, higher concentrations of the latter are achieved in the body with lower dosing, theoretically enhancing elvitegravir's viral suppression while diminishing its adverse side-effects. In contrast with ritonavir, the only other booster approved for use as a part of [[Management of HIV/AIDS|HAART]], cobicistat has no anti-HIV activity of its own.<ref name = "Highleyman">Highleyman, L.

Cobicistat is a component of two four-drug, fixed-dose combination HIV treatments. The first, [[elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil]], is marketed as ''Stribild'' and was approved by the FDA in August 2012 for use in the United States.<ref name =  "Highleyman" /><ref>R Elion, J Gathe, B Rashbaum, and others.

Boston, September 12–15, 2010.</ref> The second, elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide, is marketed as ''Genvoya'' and was approved by the FDA in November 2015 for use in the United States. Both Stribild and Genvoya are owned by [[Gilead Sciences]].

Additionally, in existence are a fixed-dose combination of cobicistat and [[Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitor]] [[darunavir]] (darunavir/cobicistat; marketed as ''Prezcobix'' by Janssen Therapeutics), and a fixed-dose combination of cobicistat and protease inhibitor [[atazanavir]] (atazanavir/cobicistat; marketed as ''Evotaz'' by [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]]). Both Prezcobix and Evotaz were approved by the FDA in January 2015.

Cobicistat is a potent inhibitor of [[cytochrome P450]] 3A enzymes, including the important [[CYP3A4]] subtype.  It also inhibits intestinal transport proteins, increasing the overall absorption of several HIV medications, including [[atazanavir]], [[darunavir]], and [[tenofovir alafenamide]].<ref>{{Cite journal

==Chemistry==

Cobicistat is a drug analogue of [[ritonavir]], in which the [[valine]] moiety is exchanged for a [[Morpholine|2-morpholinoethyl]] group, and the backbone [[Hydroxy group|hydroxyl]] group is removed. These changes effectively eliminate the anti-HIV activity of ritonavir while preserving its inhibitory effects on the [[CYP3A|CYP3A isozyme]] family of proteins.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ml1000257 | volume=1 | issue=5 | title=Cobicistat (GS-9350): A Potent and Selective Inhibitor of Human CYP3A as a Novel Pharmacoenhancer | year=2010 | journal=ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters | pages=209–213 | last1 = Xu | first1 = Lianhong | last2 = Liu | first2 = Hongtao | last3 = Murray | first3 = Bernard P. | last4 = Callebaut | first4 = Christian | last5 = Lee | first5 = Melody S. | last6 = Hong | first6 = Allen | last7 = Strickley | first7 = Robert G. | last8 = Tsai | first8 = Luong K. | last9 = Stray | first9 = Kirsten M. | last10 = Wang | first10 = Yujin | last11 = Rhodes | first11 = Gerry R. | last12 = Desai | first12 = Manoj C.}}</ref> Cobicistat is therefore able to increase plasma concentration of other coadministered anti-HIV drugs without the risk of causing cobicistat-resistant [[HIV drug resistance|mutations]] in the HIV virus.

===Synthesis===

Cobicistat may be synthesized from any number of commercially available starting materials. The synthesis shown below utilizes [[L-methionine]] and [[bromoacetic acid]] as starting materials.<ref>[https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/docservicepdf_pct/id00000034552647/PAMPH/WO2016128885.pdf WO 2016128885]</ref>

==Discovery and development ==

Cobicistat was developed through [[Structure activity relationship|structure-activity relationship]] studies using [[ritonavir]] and desoxyritonavir as lead compounds. These studies were conducted by scientists at [[Gilead Sciences]], and successfully optimized ritonavir into a potent CYP3A inhibitor lacking anti-HIV activity. Cobicistat shows potent, selective inhibition of the CYP3A isozyme family ([[IC50|IC<sub>50</sub>]] 0.15 μM) compared to some [[CYP1A]] and [[CYP2C]] isozymes.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 24412072 |doi=10.1016/j.bmcl.2013.12.057 | volume=24 | title=Structure-activity relationships of diamine inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A as novel pharmacoenhancers.
