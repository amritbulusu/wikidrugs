'''Clotiazepam'''<ref>DE Patent 2107356</ref> (marketed under brand name '''Clozan''', '''Distensan''', '''Trecalmo''', '''Rize''', '''Rizen''' and '''Veratran''') is a [[thienodiazepine]] drug which is a [[benzodiazepine]] analog. The clotiazepam molecule differs from benzodiazepines in that the benzene ring has been replaced by a [[thiophene]] ring.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Niwa T, Shiraga T, Ishii I, Kagayama A, Takagi A |title=Contribution of human hepatic cytochrome p450 isoforms to the metabolism of psychotropic drugs |journal=Biol.

==Pharmacokinetics==
A cross-over study in six healthy volunteers (median age 28 years) was conducted using single-dose pharmacokinetics of 5&nbsp;mg clotiazepam [[Drop (unit)|drops]], [[Tablet (pharmacy)|oral tablets]], and [[Sublingual administration|sublingual tablets]]. The formulations had similar systemic availability. Compared with oral tablets, the sublingual route gave a lower peak concentration and a delayed peak time, while drops gave a greater maximum concentration with a similar peak time. The use of drops is suggested for a more marked initial effect and the sublingual route for easier administration, especially in the elderly.<ref name="PHKTS">{{Cite journal | title = The pharmacokinetics of clotiazepam after oral and sublingual administration to volunteers | journal = European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 37 | issue = 6 | pages = 617–619 | year = 1989 | doi =  10.1007/BF00562556 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00562556 |author1=C.

==Pharmacology==
Similar to other benzodiazepines clotiazepam has [[anxiolytic]], [[sedative]], [[hypnotic]], [[amnesic]], [[anticonvulsant]] and [[muscle relaxant]] pharmacological properties.<ref name="Mandrioli-2008"/> Clotiazepam binds to the benzodiazepine site of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor where it acts as a full agonist; this action results in an enhanced GABA inhibitory effect at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor which results in the pharmacological effects of clotiazepam.<ref name="Yakushiji-1989">{{Cite journal | last1 = Yakushiji | first1 = T. | last2 = Fukuda | first2 = T. | last3 = Oyama | first3 = Y. | last4 = Akaike | first4 = N. | title = Effects of benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine compounds on the GABA-induced response in frog isolated sensory neurones | format = PDF | journal = Br J Pharmacol | volume = 98 | issue = 3 | pages = 735–40 |date=Nov 1989 | doi =   10.1111/j.1476-5381.1989.tb14600.x| pmid=2574062 | pmc=1854765}}</ref>

Clotiazepam has a relatively short [[elimination half-life]] and is less prone to accumulation after repeated dosing compared to longer-acting benzodiazepine agents. It is metabolised via oxidation.<ref name="Greenblatt-">{{Cite journal | last1 = Greenblatt | first1 = DJ. | last2 = Divoll | first2 = M. | last3 = Abernethy | first3 = DR. | last4 = Ochs | first4 = HR. | last5 = Shader | first5 = RI. | title = Clinical pharmacokinetics of the newer benzodiazepines | journal = Clin Pharmacokinet | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 233–52 | year =  1983| doi =  10.2165/00003088-198308030-00003| pmid = 6133664 }}</ref> Clotiazepam is metabolised to hydroxy-clotiazepam and desmethyl-clotiazepam. After oral ingestion of a single 5&nbsp;mg dose of clotiazepam by three healthy volunteers the drug was rapidly absorbed.<ref name="Arendt-1982"/> The elimination half-life of the drug and its metabolites range from 6.5 hours to 18 hours.
