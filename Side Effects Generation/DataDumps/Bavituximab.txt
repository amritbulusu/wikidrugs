'''Bavituximab''' (PGN401) is a  human-mouse [[Chimera (protein)|chimeric]] [[monoclonal antibody]] against [[phosphatidylserine]], which is a component of cell membranes that is exposed when a cell is [[Malignant transformation|transformed]] into [[solid tumor]] cancer cell or dies,<ref name=Adis/><ref name=NDD2015>{{cite journal|last3=Freeman, G. J.|last2=Rennert P. D.|last1=Mahoney K. M.|title=Combination cancer immunotherapy and new immunomodulatory targets|url=|journal=Nature Reviews. Drug Discovery|volume=14|issue=8|pages=561-84|date=August 2015|pmid=26228759}}</ref> and when cells are infected with [[hepatitis C]].<ref name=2011HepRev/> The [[apoptosis|process of cell death]] is highly controlled and so there usually no immune response to phosphatidylserine but when bavituximab binds to it, the conjugate appears to stimulate an immune response in humans.<ref name=NDD2015/>

As of January 2016, bavituximab had been in a Phase III clinical trial for [[non-small cell lung cancer]], a Phase II/III trial for breast cancer, a Phase II trial for pancreatic cancer, a phase I/II trial for [[hepatocellular carcinoma]], and Phase I clinical trials in malignant melanoma and rectal cancer; its development had been discontinued for influenza and prostate cancer.<ref name=Adis>Staff, Adis Insight.
