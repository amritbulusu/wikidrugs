'''Apimostinel''' (former developmental code name '''NRX-1074''') is a novel [[antidepressant]], acting as a selective [[partial agonist]] of an [[allosteric site]] of the [[glycine]] site of the [[NMDA receptor]] complex, which is under investigation by [[Naurex]] (recently acquired by [[Allergan]] for $560 million in late 2015) for the treatment of [[major depressive disorder]].<ref name="MEDRS  review">{{cite journal | author = Hayley S, Litteljohn D | title = Neuroplasticity and the next wave of antidepressant strategies | journal = Front Cell Neurosci | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 218 | date = 2013 | pmid = 24312008 | pmc = 3834236 | doi = 10.3389/fncel.2013.00218 | quote = Despite the mounting evidence indicating that ketamine has rapid and robust antidepressant properties (and notwithstanding the earlier mentioned preliminary clinical data indicating that long-term, low-dose ketamine may be both tolerable and effective; e.g., Messer et al., 2010), concerns over ketamine’s psychotomimetic effects have spurred intensive efforts to develop safer and more tolerable glutamate-based antidepressants. At the vanguard of this movement are the “next generation” NMDA receptor antagonists. Included here are the aminoadamantanes, memantine and amantadine (Sani et al., 2012); the NR2B-selective antagonists, traxoprodil (CP-101,606; Preskorn et al., 2008) and MK-0657 (Ibrahim et al., 2012a); and the low-affinity NMDA channel blocker AZD6765 (Zarate et al., 2013). The NMDA receptor glycine-site functional partial agonist, GLYX-13, and its orally bioavailable and presumed more potent analog, NRX-1074, have also garnered the recent attention of researchers and clinicians (Burgdorf et al., 2013; Dolgin, 2013), as have several modulators of metabotropic glutamate receptors (e.g., the mGluR7 allosteric agonist AMN082; Bradley et al., 2012) and select α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor potentiators (e.g., Org 26576; Nations et al., 2012).}}</ref><ref name="PRNewswire2010">{{cite web | url = http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/naurexs-novel-antidepressant-glyx-13-recognized-as-one-of-windhovers-top-10-neuroscience-projects-to-watch-101866728.html | author = PR Newswire | title = Naurex's Novel Antidepressant GLYX-13 Recognized as One of Windhover's Top 10 Neuroscience Projects to Watch | year = 2010}}</ref><ref name="PRNewswire2014">{{cite web | url = http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/naurex-reports-positive-top-line-phase-2b-results-for-novel-antidepressant-glyx-13-and-advances-nrx-1074-into-phase-2-depression-study-258089291.html | author = PR Newswire | title = Naurex Reports Positive Top-Line Phase 2b Results for Novel Antidepressant GLYX-13 and Advances NRX-1074 into Phase 2 Depression Study | year = 2014}}</ref><ref name="pmid24410564">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Dang YH, Ma XC, Zhang JC, etal | title = Targeting of NMDA Receptors in the Treatment of Major Depression | journal = Curr.

Its [[mechanism of action]] and effects are similar to those of [[rapastinel]] (GLYX-13), which is under development as an [[adjunctive therapy]] for [[treatment-resistant depression]] also by Naurex. However, apimostinel is 100-fold more potent by weight and, whereas rapastinel must be administered via [[intravenous injection]], is orally-active.<ref name="PRNewswire2014" /> Apimostinel is intended by Naurex as an improved, follow-up drug to rapastinel. Similarly to rapastinel, apimostinel is an [[amide|amidated]] [[tetrapeptide]], and has almost an identical [[chemical structure]] to rapastinel, but has been [[molecular modification|structurally modified]] via the addition of a [[benzyl group]]. The drug has shown rapid [[antidepressant]] effects in [[animal model|pre-clinical model]]s of [[depression (mood)|depression]].<ref name="PRNewswire2014" /> In addition, similarly to rapastinel, it is well-tolerated and lacks the [[schizophrenia]]-like [[psychotomimetic]] effects of other [[NMDA receptor antagonist]]s such as [[ketamine]].<ref name="PRNewswire2014" />

Commercial competitors of apimostinel include [[4-chlorokynurenine|AV-101]] from VistaGen Therapeutics and Cerecor's [[CERC-301]].<sup>[[CERC-301#cite note-8|[8]]]</sup>

==Society and culture==

===Naurex===
Naruex, the original company responsible for apimostinel, was a pharmaceutical company that developed drug candidates as [[NMDA receptor]] [[Receptor modulator|modulators]]. The company was acquired by Allergan in later 2015, who continued the clinical trials for Naurex's NMDA receptor modulator drugs. Allergan went public in 1993 as Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc and was rebranded as Allergan in 2015 after the acquisition of several pharmaceutical companies.  Allergan trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker AGN.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allergan.com/investors/investors-faqs|title=Investor FAQs|website=Allergan|access-date=2016-11-20}}</ref>

In mid-2016, the acquired Naurenx, now rebranded as Aptinyx, announced a $65 million start up round with venture capital companies including New Leaf Venture Partenrs aimed towards NMDA modulation for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and PTSD.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/naurex-vets-reprise-blockbuster-nmda-r-d-role-65m-startup-round|title=Naurex vets reprise blockbuster NMDA R&D role with $65M startup round {{!}} FierceBiotech|website=www.fiercebiotech.com|access-date=2016-11-20}}</ref>
