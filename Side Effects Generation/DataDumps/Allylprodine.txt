'''Allylprodine'''<ref>{{US Patent|2798073}} - PIPERIDINE DERIVATIVES AND PREPARATION</ref> is an [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] that is an [[structural analog|analog]] of [[prodine]]. It was discovered in by Hoffman-La Roche in 1957 during research into the related drug [[pethidine]]. Derivatives were tested to prove the theory that phenolic & non-phenolic opioids bind at different sites of the opiate receptor.

Allylprodine is more potent as an analgesic than similar drugs such as [[α-prodine]], and the 3''R'',4''S''-isomer is 23 times more potent than morphine, due to the [[allyl]] group binding to an additional amino acid target in the binding site on the [[mu opioid receptor|μ-opioid receptor]]. It is also stereoselective, with one [[isomer]] being much more active.<ref>{{Cite journal

When modeled in three dimensions, the alkene overlays the alkenes found in [[14-Cinnamoyloxycodeinone|14-cinnamoyloxycodeinone]] and in [[14-allyloxycodeinone]], re-enforcing the presence of an interaction of the alkene.{{cn|date=September 2015}}

Allylprodine produces similar effects to other opioids, such as [[analgesia]] and [[sedation]], along with side effects such as [[nausea]], [[itching]], [[vomiting]] and [[respiratory depression]] which may be harmful or fatal.

==Legal status==

Allylprodine is regulated in most countries as is morphine, including being in Schedule I of the US Controlled Substances Act 1970 as a Narcotic with ACSCN 9602 and a 2014 annual aggregate manufacturing quota of 2 grammes.<ref>http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/quotas/2014/fr0825.htm</ref>

===Australia===
Allylprodine is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the [[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons|Poisons Standard]] (February 2017).<ref name="Poisons Standard">Poisons Standard October 2015 https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2017L00057</ref> A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.<ref name="Poisons Standard" />
