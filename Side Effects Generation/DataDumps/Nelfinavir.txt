'''Nelfinavir''' (brand name '''Viracept''') is an [[antiretroviral drug]] used in the treatment of the [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV). Nelfinavir belongs to the class of drugs known as [[protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitors]] (PIs) and like other PIs is almost always used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.

Nelfinavir mesylate (Viracept, formerly AG1343) is a potent and orally bioavailable human immunodeficiency virus [[HIV-1 protease]] inhibitor (Ki=2nM) and is widely prescribed in combination with [[HIV]] reverse transcriptase inhibitors for the treatment of HIV infection.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Zhang KE, Wu E, Patick AK |display-authors=etal |title=Circulating metabolites of the human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitor nelfinavir in humans: structural identification, levels in plasma, and antiviral activities |journal=Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=1086–93 |date=April 2001 |pmid=11257019 |pmc=90428 |doi=10.1128/AAC.45.4.1086-1093.2001 |url=}}</ref>

== History ==

Nelfinavir was developed by Agouron Pharmaceuticals as part of a joint venture with Eli Lilly and Company.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaldor SW, Kalish VJ|title=Viracept (nelfinavir mesylate, AG1343): A potent, orally bioavailable inhibitor of HIV-1 protease |journal=Journal of Medicinal Chemistry |volume=40 |pages=3979–3985 |date=1997  |pmid=9397180 |doi=10.1021/jm9704098 |url=|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Agouron Pharmaceuticals was acquired by Warner Lambert in 1999 and is now a subsidiary of Pfizer. It is marketed in Europe by [[Hoffman-La Roche]] and elsewhere by [[ViiV Healthcare]].

The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved it for therapeutic use on March 14, 1997,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} making it the twelfth{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} approved antiretroviral. The initial product launched proved to be the largest{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} "biotech launch" in the history of the pharmaceutical industry, achieving first full year sales exceeding $US335M.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Agouron's [[patent]] on the drug expired in 2014.

On the 6 June 2007, both the [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] and the [[European Medicines Agency]]<ref>[http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/general/direct/pr/25128307en.pdf Press release] from the [[European Medicines Agency]] regarding possible genotoxic ethyl mesylate contamination</ref> put out an alert requesting the recall of any of the drug in circulation, because some batches may have been contaminated with potentially cancer-causing chemicals.

== Pharmacology ==
Nelfinavir should be taken with food. The bioavailability of Nelfinavir is increased 2.5 to 5 times when taken with food.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Taking the drug with food also decreases the risk of [[diarrhea]] as a side effect.

== Mechanism of action ==
Nelfinavir is a [[Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitor]]: it inhibits [[HIV-1 protease|HIV-1]] and HIV-2 proteases. HIV protease is an [[aspartate protease]] which splits viral protein molecules into smaller fragments, and it is vital to both the replication of the virus within the cell, and also to the release of mature viral particles from an infected cell. Nelfinavir is a competitive inhibitor<ref name=Shim2014>{{cite journal |pmc=4081601 |title=Recent Advances in Drug Repositioning for the Discovery of New Anticancer Drugs |year=2014 |doi=10.7150/ijbs.9224 |pmid=25013375 |volume=10 |journal=Int. J. Biol. Sci. |pages=654–63 | last1 = Shim | first1 = JS | last2 = Liu | first2 = JO}}</ref> (2 nM) which is designed to bind tightly and is not cleaved due to the presence of a hydroxyl group as opposed to a keto group in the middle amino acid residue mimic, which would be otherwise S-phenylcysteine. All protease inhibitors bind to the protease, the precise mode of binding determines how the molecule inhibits the protease. The way Nelfinavir binds the enzyme may be sufficiently unique to reduce cross-resistance{{clarify|date=May 2012}} between it and other PIs. Also, not all PIs inhibit both HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases.

== Toxicity ==
Common (>1%) side effects include [[insulin resistance]], [[hyperglycemia]] and [[lipodystrophy]].<ref name=Shim2014/>

Nelfinavir can produce a range of adverse side effects. Flatulence, [[diarrhea]] or abdominal pain are common (i.e. experienced by more than one in one hundred patients). Fatigue, urination, [[rash]], [[mouth ulcer]]s or [[hepatitis]] are less frequent effects (experienced by one in one thousand to one in one hundred patients). [[Nephrolithiasis]], [[arthralgia]], [[leukopenia]], [[pancreatitis]] or [[allergy|allergic]] reactions may occur, but are rare (less than one in one thousand patients) .

Nelfinavir inhibits maturation and export of the Herpes Simplex 1 virus <ref>http://jvi.asm.org/content/88/10/5455.short</ref> and the Kaposi's Sarcoma virus.<ref>http://aac.asm.org/content/55/6/2696.short</ref>

=== Potential anti-cancer activity ===
Since 2009, nelfinavir has been under investigation for potential use as an anti-cancer agent.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chow WA, Jiang C, Guan M |title= Anti-HIV drugs for cancer therapeutics: back to the future? |journal= Lancet Oncol |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=61–71 |year=2009 |pmid=19111246 |doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(08)70334-6}}</ref> When applied to cancer cells in culture ([[in vitro]]), it can inhibit the growth of a variety of cancer types and can trigger cell death ([[apoptosis]]).<ref name="pmid17785575">{{cite journal | last1 = Gills | first1 = JJ | last2 = Lopiccolo | first2 = J | last3 = Tsurutani | first3 = J | last4 = Shoemaker | first4 = RH | last5 = Best | first5 = CJM | last6 = Abu-Asab | first6 = MS | last7 = Borojerdi | first7 = J | last8 = Warfel | first8 = NA | last9 = Gardner | first9 = ER | last10 = Danish | first10 = M. | last11 = Hollander | first11 = M.

In the United States, about three dozen clinical trials are being conducted (or have been completed) in order to determine whether nelfinavir is effective as a cancer therapeutic agent in humans.<ref>http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=Nelfinavir+cancer</ref> In some of these trials, nelfinavir is used alone in monotherapy fashion, whereas in others it is combined with other modes of cancer therapy, such as well-established [[chemotherapeutic agents]] or [[radiation therapy]].

{{as of |April 2016}}, no phase 3 cancer trials are registered.<ref>[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=Nelfinavir&phase=2 Phase 3 trials]</ref>

===Anti-virulence activity===

Nelfinavir and simple derivatives have been found to inhibit the production of the [[virulence factor]] [[streptolysin|streptolysin S]], a [[cytolysin]] produced by the human [[pathogen]] ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]''.<ref name="pmid25668590">{{cite journal |vauthors=Maxson T, Deane CD, Molloy EM, Cox CL, Markley AL, Lee SW, Mitchell DA |title=HIV protease inhibitors block streptolysin S production |journal=ACS Chemical Biology |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=1217–26 |year=2015 |pmid=25668590 |doi=10.1021/cb500843r |pmc=4574628}}</ref> Nelfinavir and these related molecules did not exhibit detectable [[antibiotic]] activity, but did also inhibit the production of other biologically active molecules, including [[plantazolicin]] (antibiotic), listeriolysin S (cytolysin), and clostridiolysin S (cytolysin), by other [[bacteria]].<ref name="pmid25668590" />

== Interactions ==
Nelfinavir's interaction profile is similar to that of other [[antiretroviral drug|protease inhibitors]]. Most interactions occur at the level of the [[Cytochrome P450 oxidase|Cytochrome P450]] isozymes [[CYP3A4|3A4]] and [[CYP2C19]], by which nelfinavir is metabolised.
