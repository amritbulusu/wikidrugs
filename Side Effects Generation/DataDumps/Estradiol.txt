'''Estradiol''' ('''E2'''), also spelled '''oestradiol''', is a [[steroid]], an [[estrogen]], and the primary [[female]] [[sex hormone]]. It is named for and is important in the regulation of the [[estrous cycle|estrous]] and [[menstrual cycle|menstrual]] female [[reproductive cycle]]s. Estradiol is essential for the development and maintenance of female [[reproductive organ|reproductive tissue]]s such as the [[breast]]s, [[uterus]], and [[vagina]] during [[puberty]], [[adulthood]], and [[pregnancy]],<ref name="pmid7083198">{{cite journal | author = Ryan KJ | title = Biochemistry of aromatase: significance to female reproductive physiology | journal = Cancer Res. | volume = 42 | issue = 8 Suppl | pages = 3342s–3344s | date = August 1982 | pmid = 7083198 | url = }}</ref> but it also has important effects in many other [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s, including [[bone]], [[fat]], [[skin]], [[liver]], and the [[brain]]. While estrogen levels in men are lower compared to those in women, estrogens have essential functions in men, as well. It is found in most [[vertebrate]]s and [[crustacean]]s, [[insect]]s, [[fish]], and other [[animal]] [[species]].<ref name="Mechoulam_2005">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mechoulam R, Brueggemeier RW, Denlinger DL | title = Estrogens in insects | journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences |date=September 1984 | volume = 40 | issue = 9 | pages = 942–944|doi=10.1007/BF01946450 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/tr77034552r222m1/fulltext.pdf}}</ref><ref name = "Ozon_1972">{{cite book | editor = Idler DR | title = Steroids In Nonmammalian Vertebrates | date = 1972 | publisher = Elsevier Science | location = Oxford | isbn = 032314098X | author = Ozon R | chapter = Estrogens in Fishes, Amphibians, Reptiles, and Birds | pages = 390–414 | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ei46GE-lj2wC&lpg=PA393&ots=MwcpUDbbx3&dq=estradiol%20vertebrates&pg=PA393#v=onepage&q=estradiol%20vertebrates&f=false }}</ref>

Estradiol is produced especially within the [[ovarian follicle|follicles]] of the female [[ovary|ovaries]], but also in other [[endocrine gland|endocrine]] (i.e., [[hormone]]-producing) and nonendocrine tissues (e.g., including fat, liver, [[adrenal gland|adrenal]], breast, and [[nerve tissue|neural tissue]]s). Estradiol is [[biosynthesis|biosynthesized]] from [[cholesterol]] through a series of [[chemical intermediate]]s.<ref>Saldanha, Colin J., Luke Remage-Healey, and Barney A. Schlinger. "Synaptocrine signaling: steroid synthesis and action at the synapse." Endocrine reviews 32.4 (2011): 532-549.</ref> One principal [[metabolic pathway|pathway]] involves the generation of [[androstenedione]], which is converted into [[estrone]] by [[aromatase]] and then by [[17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]] into estradiol. Alternatively, androstenedione can be converted into [[testosterone]], an [[androgen]] and the primary [[male]] sex hormone, which in turn can be aromatized into estradiol.

===Sexual development===

The development of [[secondary sex characteristics]] in women is driven by estrogens, to be specific, estradiol.<ref name="McMillanFeigin2006">{{cite book|author1=Julia A. McMillan|author2=Ralph D.

===Reproduction===

====Female reproductive system====
In the female, estradiol acts as a growth hormone for tissue of the reproductive organs, supporting the lining of the [[vagina]], the cervical glands, the [[endometrium]], and the lining of the fallopian tubes. It enhances growth of the [[myometrium]]. Estradiol appears necessary to maintain [[oocyte]]s in the [[ovary]]. During the [[menstrual cycle]], estradiol produced by the growing follicles triggers, via a positive feedback system, the hypothalamic-pituitary events that lead to the [[luteinizing hormone]] surge, inducing ovulation. In the luteal phase, estradiol, in conjunction with [[progesterone]], prepares the endometrium for [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]]. During [[pregnancy]], estradiol increases due to [[placenta]]l production. The effect of estradiol, together with [[estrone]] and [[estriol]], in [[pregnancy]] is less clear. They may promote uterine blood flow, myometrial growth, stimulate breast growth and at term, promote cervical softening and expression of myometrial [[oxytocin]] receptors.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} In baboons, blocking of estrogen production leads to pregnancy loss, suggesting estradiol has a role in the maintenance of pregnancy. Research is investigating the role of estrogens in the process of initiation of [[Childbirth|labor]]. Actions of estradiol are required before the exposure of progesterone in the luteal phase.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

====Male reproductive system====
The effect of estradiol (and estrogens in general) upon male reproduction is complex. Estradiol is produced by action of [[aromatase]] mainly in the [[Leydig cell]]s of the [[mammal]]ian [[testicle|testis]], but also by some [[germ cell]]s and the [[Sertoli cell]]s of immature mammals.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Carreau S, Lambard S, Delalande C, Denis-Galeraud I, Bilinska B, Bourguiba S | title = Aromatase expression and role of estrogens in male gonad : a review | journal = Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology | volume = 1 | pages = 35 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12747806 | pmc = 155680 | doi = 10.1186/1477-7827-1-35 }}</ref> It functions (''[[in vitro]]'') to prevent [[apoptosis]] of male [[sperm]] cells.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Pentikäinen V, Erkkilä K, Suomalainen L, Parvinen M, Dunkel L | title = Estradiol acts as a germ cell survival factor in the human testis in vitro | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 85 | issue = 5 | pages = 2057–67 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10843196 | doi = 10.1210/jcem.85.5.6600 }}</ref>

Males with certain [[sex chromosome]] [[genetic condition]]s, such as [[Klinefelter's syndrome]], will have a higher level of estradiol.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Visootsak J, Graham JM | title = Klinefelter syndrome and other sex chromosomal anueploidies | journal = Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases | volume = 1 | issue = 42 | page = 42 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17062147 | pmc = 1634840 | doi = 10.1186/1750-1172-1-42 | url = http://www.ojrd.com/content/1/1/42 | accessdate = 20 November 2013 }}</ref>

===Skeletal system===
Estradiol has a profound effect on bone. Individuals without it (or other estrogens) will become tall and eunuchoid, as [[epiphyseal]] closure is delayed or may not take place. Bone structure is affected also, resulting in early [[osteopenia]] and [[osteoporosis]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Carani C, Qin K, Simoni M, Faustini-Fustini M, Serpente S, Boyd J, Korach KS, Simpson ER | title = Effect of testosterone and estradiol in a man with aromatase deficiency | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 337 | issue = 2 | pages = 91–5 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9211678 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199707103370204 }}</ref> Also, women past menopause experience an accelerated loss of bone mass due to a relative estrogen deficiency.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Albright|first=Fuller |author2=Smith Patricia H. |author3=Richardson Anna M.|title=Postmenopausal Osteoporosis: Its Clinical Features|journal=[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]|authorlink=Fuller Albright|date=31 May 1941|volume=116|issue=22|pages=2465–2474|doi=10.1001/jama.1941.02820220007002|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=249029|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>

Estrogen is considered to play a significant role in women’s mental health, with links suggested between the hormone level, mood and well-being.

===Gynecological cancers===
Estradiol has been tied to the development and progression of cancers such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer. Estradiol affects target tissues mainly by interacting with two [[nuclear receptor]]s called [[estrogen receptor α]] (ERα) and [[estrogen receptor β]] (ERβ).<ref name=flav>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bulzomi P, Bolli A, Galluzzo P, Leone S, Acconcia F, Marino M | title = Naringenin and 17β-estradiol coadministration prevents hormone-induced human cancer cell growth | journal = IUBMD Life | volume = 62 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–60 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 19960539 | doi = 10.1002/iub.279 }}</ref><ref name=pome>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sreeja S, Santhosh Kumar TR, Lakshmi BS, Sreeja S | title = Pomegranate extract demonstrate a selective estrogen receptor modulator profile in human tumor cell lines and in vivo models of estrogen deprivation | journal = Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry | volume = 23 | issue = 7 | pages = 725–32 | date = 17 March 2011 | pmid = 21839626 | doi = 10.1016/j.jnutbio.2011.03.015 }}</ref> One of the functions of these estrogen receptors is the modulation of [[gene expression]].

===Other functions===
Estradiol has complex effects on the [[liver]]. It affects the production of multiple [[protein]]s, including [[lipoprotein]]s, binding proteins, and proteins responsible for [[blood clotting]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} In high amounts, estradiol can lead to [[cholestasis]], for instance [[intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy|cholestasis of pregnancy]].

Certain gynecological conditions are dependent on estrogen, such as [[endometriosis]], [[leiomyoma]]ta uteri, and [[uterine bleeding]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Estrogen affects certain [[blood vessel]]s. Improvement in arterial blood flow has been demonstrated in [[coronary artery|coronary arteries]].<ref name="pmid7788912">{{cite journal |vauthors=Collins P, Rosano GM, Sarrel PM, Ulrich L, Adamopoulos S, Beale CM, McNeill JG, Poole-Wilson PA | title = 17 beta-Estradiol attenuates acetylcholine-induced coronary arterial constriction in women but not men with coronary heart disease | journal = Circulation | volume = 92 | issue = 1 | pages = 24–30 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7788912 | doi = 10.1161/01.CIR.92.1.24 }}</ref>

==Biological activity==
Estradiol acts primarily as an [[agonist]] of the [[estrogen receptor]] (ER), a [[nuclear receptor|nuclear]] [[steroid hormone receptor]]. There are two subtypes of the ER, [[estrogen receptor alpha|ERα]] and [[estrogen receptor beta|ERβ]], and estradiol potently binds to and activates both of these receptors. The result of ER activation is a modulation of [[gene transcription]] and [[gene expression|expression]] in ER-expressing [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s, which is the predominant mechanism by which estradiol mediates its biological effects in the body. Estradiol also acts as an agonist of [[membrane estrogen receptor]]s (mERs), such as [[GPER]] (GPR30), a recently discovered non-nuclear receptor for estradiol, via which it can mediate a variety of rapid, non-[[genomic]] effects.<ref name="pmid24530924">{{cite journal |vauthors=Prossnitz ER, Barton M | title = Estrogen biology: New insights into GPER function and clinical opportunities | journal = Mol.

ERα/ERβ are in inactive state trapped in multimolecular chaperone complexes organized around the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), containing p23 protein, and immunophilin, and located in majority in cytoplasm and partially in nucleus. In the E2 classical pathway or estrogen classical pathway, estradiol enters the [[cytoplasm]], where it interacts with ERs. Once bound E2, ERs dissociate from the molecular chaperone complexes and become competent to dimerize, migrate to nucleus, and to bind to specific DNA sequences ([[estrogen response element]], ERE), allowing for gene transcription which can take place over hours and days.

Estradiol is reported to be approximately 12&nbsp;times as potent as estrone and 80&nbsp;times as potent as estriol in its estrogenic activity.<ref name="Blackburn2007">{{cite book|author=Susan Tucker Blackburn|title=Maternal, Fetal, & Neonatal Physiology: A Clinical Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2y6zOSQcn14C&pg=PA43|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=1-4160-2944-3|pages=43–}}</ref><ref name="Hall2015">{{cite book|author=John E.

===Biosynthesis===
Estradiol, like other [[steroid]]s, is derived from [[cholesterol]]. After [[side chain]] cleavage and using the Δ<sup>5</sup> or the Δ<sup>4</sup>- pathway, Δ<sup>4</sup>-androstenedione is the key intermediary. A portion of the Δ<sup>4</sup>-androstenedione is converted to testosterone, which in turn undergoes conversion to estradiol by aromatase. In an alternative pathway, Δ<sup>4</sup>-androstenedione is [[aromaticity|aromatized]] to [[estrone]], which is subsequently converted to estradiol.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Walter F. Boron |author2=Emile L. Boulpaep |title=Medical Physiology: A Cellular And Molecular Approach |publisher=Elsevier/Saunders |year=2003 |page=1300 |isbn=1-4160-2328-3}}</ref>

During the reproductive years, most estradiol in women is produced by the granulosa cells of the ovaries by the aromatization of Δ<sup>4</sup>-androstenedione (produced in the theca folliculi cells) to estrone, followed by conversion of estrone to estradiol by [[17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]]. Smaller amounts of estradiol are also produced by the [[adrenal cortex]], and, in men, by the testes.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Estradiol is not produced in the [[gonad]]s only, in particular, [[adipose tissue|fat cells]] produce active precursors to estradiol, and will continue to do so even after menopause.<ref name="Mutschler">{{Cite book|last1=Mutschler|first1=Ernst|last2=Schäfer-Korting|first2=Monika|title=Arzneimittelwirkungen|language=German|location=Stuttgart|publisher=Wissenschaftliche Verlagsgesellschaft|year=2001|edition=8|pages=434, 444|isbn=3-8047-1763-2}}</ref> Estradiol is also produced in the [[brain]] and in [[artery|arterial wall]]s.

Thus, consumption may have oestrogenic effects. In light of this, consumption can be counterproductive to patients undergoing treatment for breast cancer, which usually includes depriving the cancer cells of estrogens.

===Distribution===
In plasma, estradiol is largely bound to SHBG, and also to [[human serum albumin|albumin]]. Only a fraction of 2.21% (± 0.04%) is free and biologically active, the percentage remaining constant throughout the [[menstrual cycle]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Wu CH, Motohashi T, Abdel-Rahman HA, Flickinger GL, Mikhail G | title = Free and protein-bound plasma estradiol-17 beta during the menstrual cycle | journal = J.

====Measurement====
In women, serum estradiol is measured in a [[clinical laboratory]] and reflects primarily the activity of the ovaries. As such, they are useful in the detection of baseline estrogen in women with [[amenorrhea]] or menstrual dysfunction, and to detect the state of hypoestrogenicity and menopause. Furthermore, estrogen monitoring during fertility therapy assesses follicular growth and is useful in monitoring the treatment. Estrogen-producing tumors will demonstrate persistent high levels of estradiol and other estrogens. In [[precocious puberty]], estradiol levels are inappropriately increased.

====Ranges====
Individual laboratory results should always been interpreted using the ranges provided by the laboratory that performed the test.

In the normal menstrual cycle, estradiol levels measure typically <50&nbsp;pg/ml at menstruation, rise with follicular development (peak: 200 pg/ml), drop briefly at ovulation, and rise again during the luteal phase for a second peak. At the end of the luteal phase, estradiol levels drop to their menstrual levels unless there is a pregnancy.

During pregnancy, estrogen levels, including estradiol, rise steadily toward term. The source of these estrogens is the [[placenta]], which aromatizes [[prohormone]]s produced in the fetal adrenal gland.

==Medical use==
{{Main article|Estradiol (medication)}}
Estradiol is used as a [[medication]], mainly in [[hormone replacement therapy]].<ref name="pmid16112947" />

==Chemistry==
Estradiol is an [[estrane]] (C18) [[steroid]].<ref name="pmid16112947">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuhl H | title = Pharmacology of estrogens and progestogens: influence of different routes of administration | journal = Climacteric | volume = 8 Suppl 1 | issue = | pages = 3–63 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16112947 | doi = 10.1080/13697130500148875 | url = }}</ref> It is also known as '''17β-estradiol''' (to distinguish it from [[17α-estradiol]]) or as '''estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17β-diol'''. It has two [[hydroxyl group]]s, one at the C3 position and the other at the 17β position, as well as three [[double bond]]s in the A [[ring (chemistry)|ring]]. Due to its two hydroxyl groups, estradiol is often abbreviated as '''E2'''. The structurally related estrogens, estrone (E1), estriol (E3), and [[estetrol]] (E4) have one, three, and four hydroxyl groups, respectively.

==Society and culture==

===Etymology===
The name ''estradiol'' derives from ''estra-'', [[Greek language|Gk.]] ''{{lang|grc|οἶστρος}}'' (oistros, literally meaning "verve or inspiration"),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=oistros&la=greek|title=Greek Word Study Tool: oistros|publisher=[[Perseus Project|Perseus Digital Library]]|accessdate=2011-12-28}}</ref> which refers to the [[estrane]] [[steroid]] [[ring (chemistry)|ring]] system, and ''-diol'', a chemical term and suffix indicating that the compound is a type of [[alcohol]] bearing two [[hydroxyl]] [[functional group|group]]s.
