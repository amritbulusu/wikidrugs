'''α-Methylfentanyl''' (or '''''alpha''-Methylfentanyl''') is an [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] that is an [[structural analog|analog]] of [[fentanyl]].

==History==

α-Methylfentanyl was initially discovered by a team at [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]] in the 1960s.<ref>US Patent 3164600</ref> In 1976, it began to appear mixed with "china white" heroin as an additive. It was first identified in the bodies of two drug overdose victims in [[Orange County, California]], in December 1979, who appeared to have died from opiate overdose but tested negative for any known drugs of this type.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kram TC, Cooper DA, Allen AC | title = Behind the identification of China White | journal = Analytical Chemistry | year = 1981 | volume = 53 | issue = 12 | pages = 1379A–1386A | pmid = 7294353 | doi=10.1021/ac00235a003}}</ref> Over the next year, there were 13 more deaths, and eventually the responsible agent was identified as α-methylfentanyl.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gillespie TJ, Gandolfi AJ, Davis TP, Morano RA | title = Identification and quantification of alpha-methylfentanyl in post mortem specimens | journal = Journal of Analytical Toxicology | year = 1982 | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 139–142 | pmid = 7109557 | doi=10.1093/jat/6.3.139}}</ref>

α-Methylfentanyl was placed on the Schedule I list in September 1981, only two years after its appearance on the street, but already other analogs were being developed. Following the appearance of α-methylfentanyl on the market, over ten new analogs of fentanyl have been reported, starting with [[Parafluorofentanyl|para-fluorofentanyl]], followed by [[Alphamethylacetylfentanyl|α-methylacetylfentanyl]], then by the highly potent [[3-methylfentanyl]], and subsequently by many others such as [[Betahydroxyfentanyl|β-hydroxyfentanyl]], [[ohmefentanyl]], [[Betahydroxythiofentanyl|β-hydroxythiofentanyl]] and β-hydroxy-4-methylfentanyl.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Henderson GL. Designer Drugs: Past History and Future Prospects | journal = Journal of Forensic Sciences | year = 1988 | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 569–575 | pmid = 3286815 | title = Designer drugs: Past history and future prospects}}</ref> The development of such a wide structural family of novel narcotic drugs was a major factor responsible for the implementation of the [[Federal Analog Act]] which for the first time attempted to control entire families of drugs based on their structural similarity rather than scheduling new drug analogs individually as each appeared.

In 1991, a group of Russian chemistry students discovered a simplified synthesis route which used phosgene instead of phenetilamine.<ref>{{cite news | first = GUY | last = CHAZAN | title = The trade in illegal narcotics looks set to mushroom... | url = http://www.upi.com/Archives/1993/05/27/The-trade-in-illegal-narcotics-looks-set-to-mushroom/4960738475200/ | publisher = United Press International | date = May 27, 1993 | access-date = April 6, 2017 | language = English}}</ref> Soon, abuse of the drug became widespread, causing a tenth of overdoses in the Moscow region. α-Methylfentanyl became notorious for low safety, and production declined.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Effects==
{{medref|section|date=November 2013}}
α-Methylfentanyl has similar effects to [[fentanyl]]. It is less potent by weight due to reduced binding affinity to its [[Mu opioid receptor|target]] site, yet longer acting as the α-methyl group interferes with binding to metabolic enzymes which break the drug down. The independent discovery of the effect of the α-methyl group on fentanyl also marked the first time clandestine recreational-drug research had an effect on practical scientific research.<ref>[http://opioids.com/ohmefentanyl/structure.html Ohmefentanyl]</ref>

Since fentanyl itself is highly potent and notorious for causing fatal overdoses when abused, and also very short lasting with recreational users often administering doses every hour, α-methylfentanyl could have several advantages over the parent compound as a recreational drug. Side effects of fentanyl analogs are similar to those of fentanyl itself, which include [[itching]], [[nausea]] and potentially serious [[respiratory depression]] (namely with overdoses or improper drug-combinations, such as with [[benzodiazepines]]) which can be life-threatening.<ref>[http://zakonsteroid.com/zhiroszhigateli-efedrin/402-china-white-25-100caps.html China White]</ref>

Fentanyl analogs such as α-methylfentanyl and [[3-methylfentanyl]] are often used as the "cut" in small amounts in normal heroin stamps and bags, making them more potent and profitable when sold as heroin alone due to the advantage of raising the retail price and potency per unit sold.
