'''Flunarizine''', sold under the brand name '''Sibelium''' among others, is a drug classified as a [[calcium antagonist]] which is used for various indications.<ref>{{cite journal|pmc=1987188|year=1984|author1=Fagbemi|first1=O|title=The effects of verapamil, prenylamine, flunarizine and cinnarizine on coronary artery occlusion-induced arrhythmias in anaesthetized rats|journal=British Journal of Pharmacology|volume=83|issue=1|pages=299–304|last2=Kane|first2=KA|last3=McDonald|first3=FM|last4=Parratt|first4=JR|last5=Rothaul|first5=AL|pmid=6487894|doi=10.1111/j.1476-5381.1984.tb10146.x}}</ref> It is not available by prescription in the [[United States]] or [[Japan]]. The drug was discovered at [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]] in 1968.

==Medical uses==
Flunarizine is effective in the prophylaxis of [[migraine]],<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=6343298|year=1983|author1=Amery|first1=WK|title=Flunarizine, a calcium channel blocker: A new prophylactic drug in migraine|journal=Headache|volume=23|issue=2|pages=70–4|doi=10.1111/j.1526-4610.1983.hed2302070.x}}</ref> occlusive [[peripheral vascular disease]], [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]] of central and peripheral origin,<ref name="Dinnendahl" /> and as an adjuvant in the therapy of [[epilepsy]].{{fact|date=May 2016}} It has been shown to significantly reduce headache frequency and severity in both adults and children.

==Contraindications==
Flunarizine is [[contraindicated]] in patients with depression, in the acute phase of a [[stroke]], and in patients with [[extrapyramidal symptoms]] or [[Parkinson's disease]].<ref name="AC">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2015|language=German}}</ref> It is also contraindicated in [[hypotension]], heart failure and [[arrhythmia]].{{fact|date=May 2016}}

==Side effects==
Common side effects include drowsiness (20% of patients), weight gain (10%), as well as extrapyramidal effects and [[Depression (mood)|depression]] in elderly patients.<ref name="Dinnendahl">{{cite journal|title=Arzneistoff-Profile|editors=Dinnendahl, V, Fricke, U|publisher=Govi Pharmazeutischer Verlag|location=Eschborn, Germany|date=2012|edition=26|volume=2|isbn=978-3-7741-9846-3|language=German}}</ref>

==Interactions==
The effects of other [[sedative|sedating]] drugs and alcohol, as well as [[antihypertensives]], can be increased. No relevant [[pharmacokinetic]] interactions have been described.<ref name="Dinnendahl" /><ref name="AC" />

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
Flunarizine is a non-selective calcium antagonist with moderate other actions including [[antihistamine]], [[serotonin receptor]] blocking and [[D2 receptor|dopamine D<sub>2</sub>]] blocking activity. Compared to other calcium channel blockers such as [[dihydropyridine]] derivatives, [[verapamil]] and [[diltiazem]], flunarizine has low affinity to [[voltage-dependent calcium channel]]s. It has been theorised that it may act not by inhibiting calcium entry into cells, but rather by an [[intracellular]] mechanism such as antagonising [[calmodulin]], a calcium binding protein.<ref name="Dinnendahl" />

===Pharmacokinetics===
Flunarizine is well absorbed (>80%) from the gut and reaches maximal [[blood plasma]] concentrations after two to four hours, with more than 99% of the substance bound to [[plasma protein]]s. It readily passes the [[blood–brain barrier]]. When given daily, a [[steady state (pharmacokinetics)|steady state]] is reached after five to eight weeks. Concentrations in the brain are about ten times higher than in the plasma.<ref name="Dinnendahl" /><ref name="AC" />

The substance is metabolised in the liver, mainly by the enzyme [[CYP2D6]]. At least 15 different metabolites are described, including (in animals) ''N''-des[[alkyl]] and [[hydroxyl|hydroxy]] derivatives and [[glucuronide]]s. Less than 1% is excreted in unchanged form, and the main excretion path is via [[bile]] and faeces. [[Elimination half life]] varies widely between individuals and is about 5 to 15 hours after a single dose, and 18 to 19 days on average when given daily.<ref name="Dinnendahl" /><ref name="AC" />

==Chemistry==
Flunnarizine is a [[diphenylmethylpiperazine]] [[chemical derivative|derivative]] related to the antihistamine [[hydroxyzine]].

==Research==
Flunarizine may help to reduce the severity and duration of attacks of paralysis associated with the more serious form of [[alternating hemiplegia]], as well as being effective in rapid onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP). Both these conditions arise from specific mutations in the ATP1A3 gene.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brashear|first1=A, et al.|title=ATP1A3-Related Neurologic Disorders|date=1993|pmid=20301294}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kansagra|first1=S|last2=Mikati|first2=MA|last3=Vigevano|first3=F|title=Alternating hemiplegia of childhood.|journal=Handbook of clinical neurology|date=2013|volume=112|pages=821-6|pmid=23622289}}</ref>
