'''BOD''', or 4-[[methyl]]-2,5,beta-tri[[methoxy]][[phenethylamine]], is a lesser-known [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|psychedelic drug]].  It is the beta-[[methoxy]] [[analog (chemistry)|analog]] of [[2C-D]]. BOD was first synthesized by [[Alexander Shulgin]]. In his book ''[[PiHKAL|PiHKAL (Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved)]]'', the dosage range is listed as 15–25&nbsp;mg, and the duration listed as 8–16 hours. BOD produces strongly distorted open-eye visuals, and some closed-eye visuals. It also has an [[entheogen]]ic effect and produces [[humor]].<ref>{{CitePiHKAL}}</ref> Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of BOD.
