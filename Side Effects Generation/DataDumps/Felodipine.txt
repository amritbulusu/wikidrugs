'''Felodipine''' is a medication of the [[calcium channel blocker]] type which is used to treat [[hypertension|high blood pressure]].

==Medical use==
Felodipine is used to treat [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] and stable [[angina]].<ref name=UKlabel2015/><ref name=USlabel2012>{{cite web|title=Felodipine US label|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/019834s025lbl.pdf|publisher=FDA|date=October 2012}}</ref>

It should not be used for people who are pregnant, have [[decompensated heart failure|acute heart failure]], are having a [[heart attack]], have an [[Valvular heart disease|obstructed heart valve]], or have obstructions that block [[Pressure overload|bloodflow out of the heart]].<ref name=UKlabel2015/>

For people with [[liver failure]] the dose needs to be lowered, because felodipine is cleared by the liver.<ref name=UKlabel2015/>

===Interactions===
Felodipine is metabolized by [[CYP3A4|cytochrome P450 3A4]], so substances that inhibit or activate CYP3A4 can strongly effect how much felodipine is present.<ref name=UKlabel2015/>

CYP3A4 inhibitors, which increase the amount of felodipine available per dose, include [[cimetidine]], [[erythromycin]], [[itraconazole]], [[ketoconazole]], [[Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|HIV protease inhibitors]], and [[grapefruit juice]].<ref name=UKlabel2015/><ref>{{cite journal| journal=Nutr J.| volume=6| issue=33| date=October 30, 2007| doi=10.1186/1475-2891-6-33| pmid=17971226|title=Medicinal importance of grapefruit juice and its interaction with various drugs| author=Jawad Kiani, Sardar Z Imam| accessdate=2008-04-09|pages=33| pmc=2147024}}.</ref>

CYP3A4 activators, which decrease the amount of felodipine available per dose, include [[phenytoin]], [[carbamazepine]], [[rifampicin]], [[barbiturates]], [[efavirenz]], [[nevirapine]], and [[Saint John's wort]].<ref name=UKlabel2015/>

==Adverse effects==
The only very common side effect, occurring in more than 1/10 people, is [[edema|pain and swelling]] in the arms and legs.<ref name=UKlabel2015/>

Common side effects, occurring in between 1% and 10% of people, include flushing, headache, [[heart palpitation]]s, dizziness and fatigue.<ref name=UKlabel2015/>

Felodipine can exacerbate [[gingivitis]].<ref name=UKlabel2015/>

==Mechanism==
Felodipine is a [[calcium channel blocker]].<ref name=UKlabel2015/> Felodipine has additionally been found to act as an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of the [[mineralocorticoid receptor]], or as an [[antimineralocorticoid]].<ref name="Luther2014">{{cite journal|last1=Luther|first1=James M.|title=Is there a new dawn for selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism?|journal=Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension|volume=23|issue=5|year=2014|pages=456–461|issn=1062-4821|doi=10.1097/MNH.0000000000000051}}</ref>

Different calcium channels are present in vascular tissue and cardiac tissue; an ''in vitro'' study on human vascular and cardiac tissues comparing how selective various calcium channel blockers are for vascular compared to cardiac tissue found the following vascular/cardiac tissue ratios: [[mibefradil]] 41,  felodipine 12; [[nifedipine]] 7, [[amlodipine]] 5, and [[verapamil]] 0.2.<ref name=Burger/>{{rp|172}}

==Chemistry==
Felodipine is a member of the 1,4-[[dihydropyridine]] class of calcium channel blockers.<ref name=Burger>{{cite book|last1=Joshi|first1=Gajanan S.|last2=Burnett|first2=James C.|last3=Abraham|first3=Donald J.|editor1-last=Abraham|editor1-first=Donald J.|title=Burger's medicinal chemistry and drug discovery.
