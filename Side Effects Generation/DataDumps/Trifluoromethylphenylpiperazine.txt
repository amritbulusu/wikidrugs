'''3-Trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine''' ('''TFMPP''') is a [[recreational drug]] of the [[piperazine]] [[chemical class]]. Usually in combination with its [[structural analog|analogue]] [[benzylpiperazine]] (BZP), it is sold as an alternative to the illicit drug [[MDMA]] ("Ecstasy") under the name "'''Legal X'''".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/tfmpp/tfmpp_basics.shtml |title=Erowid TFMPP Vault: Basics |publisher=Erowid |accessdate=2014-02-15}}</ref><ref name="Schep2011">{{cite journal |vauthors=Schep LJ, Slaughter RJ, Vale JA, Beasley DM, Gee P |title=The clinical toxicology of the designer "party pills" benzylpiperazine and trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine |journal=[[Clin Toxicol (Phila)]] |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=131–41 |date=March 2011 |pmid=21495881 |doi=10.3109/15563650.2011.572076 |url=}}</ref>

== Pharmacology ==
TFMPP has [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for the [[5-HT1A|5-HT<sub>1A</sub>]] (K<sub>i</sub> = 288&nbsp;nM), [[5-HT1B|5-HT<sub>1B</sub>]] (K<sub>i</sub> = 132&nbsp;nM), [[5-HT1D|5-HT<sub>1D</sub>]] (K<sub>i</sub> = 282&nbsp;nM), [[5-HT2A|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]] (K<sub>i</sub> = 269&nbsp;nM), and [[5-HT2C|5-HT<sub>2C</sub>]] (K<sub>i</sub> = 62&nbsp;nM) [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s, and functions as a [[full agonist]] at all sites except the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor, where it acts as a weak [[partial agonist]] or [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]].<ref name="pmid15496938">{{cite journal |vauthors=Baumann MH, Clark RD, Budzynski AG, Partilla JS, Blough BE, Rothman RB | title = N-substituted piperazines abused by humans mimic the molecular mechanism of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, or 'Ecstasy') | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 550–60 |date=March 2005 | pmid = 15496938 | doi = 10.1038/sj.npp.1300585 }}</ref> Unlike the related piperazine compound [[meta-chlorophenylpiperazine|''meta''-chlorophenylpiperazine]] (mCPP), TFMPP has insignificant affinity for the [[5-HT3|5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor]] (IC<sub>50</sub> = 2,373&nbsp;nM).<ref name="pmid1736030">{{cite journal |vauthors=Robertson DW, Bloomquist W, Wong DT, Cohen ML | title = mCPP but not TFMPP is an antagonist at cardiac 5HT3 receptors | journal = Life Sciences | volume = 50 | issue = 8 | pages = 599–605 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1736030 | doi = 10.1016/0024-3205(92)90372-V| url = }}</ref> TFMPP also binds to the [[serotonin transporter|SERT]] (EC<sub>50</sub> = 121&nbsp;nM) and evokes the [[releasing agent|release]] of [[serotonin]].<ref name="pmid15496938"/> It has no effects on [[dopamine]] or [[norepinephrine]] [[reuptake]] or efflux.<ref name="pmid15496938"/>

== Use and effects ==
TFMPP is rarely used by itself. In fact, TFMPP reduces locomotor activity and produces aversive effects in animals rather than self-administration, which may explain the decision of the DEA not to permanently make TFMPP a controlled substance.<ref name="pmid15496938"/> More commonly, TFMPP is co-administered with BZP, which acts as a norepinephrine and dopamine releasing agent.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Partilla JS, Dempsey AG, Nagpal AS, Blough BE, Baumann MH, Rothman RB |title=Interaction of amphetamines and related compounds at the vesicular monoamine transporter |journal=Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics |date=October 2006 |volume=319 |issue=1 |pages=237–46 |doi=10.1124/jpet.106.103622 |pmid=16835371}}</ref> Due to the serotonin agonist effects and increase in serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine levels produced by the BZP/TFMPP combination, this mixture of drugs produces effects which crudely mimic those of [[MDMA]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yarosh HL, Katz EB, Coop A, Fantegrossi WE |title=MDMA-like behavioral effects of N-substituted piperazines in the mouse |journal=Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behavior |date=November 2007 |volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=18–27 |doi=10.1016/j.pbb.2007.06.007}}</ref>

== Side effects ==
The combination of BZP and TFMPP has been associated with a range of side effects, including [[insomnia]], [[anxiety]], [[nausea]] and vomiting, [[headaches]] and muscle aches which may resemble [[migraine]], [[seizures]], [[impotence]], and rarely [[psychosis]],<ref name="Schep2011"/> as well as a prolonged and unpleasant [[hangover]] effect. These side effects tend to be significantly worsened when the BZP/TFMPP mix is consumed alongside [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], especially the headache, nausea, and hangover.

However, it is difficult to say how many of these side effects are produced by TFMPP itself, as it has rarely been marketed without BZP also being present, and all of the side effects mentioned are also produced by BZP (which has been sold as a single drug). Studies into other related piperazine drugs such as [[1-(3-Chlorophenyl)piperazine|mCPP]] suggest that certain side effects such as [[anxiety]], [[headache]] and [[nausea]] are common to all drugs of this class, and pills containing TFMPP are reported by users to produce comparatively more severe hangover effects than those containing only BZP. The drug can also cause the body to tremble for a long period of time.<ref>{{cite web |vauthors=Wilkins C, Girling M, Sweetsur P, Huckle T, Huakau J | title =Legal party pill use in New Zealand: Prevalence of use, availability, health harms and ‘gateway effects’ of benzylpiperazine (BZP) and trifluorophenylmethylpiperazine (TFMPP) | publisher = Centre for Social and Health Outcomes Research and Evaluation (SHORE)  | url =http://www.spiritualhigh.co.uk/spiritualhigh.co.uk/downloads/Legal-party-pills-in-New-Zealand-report.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-04-14}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=February 2015}}

It has also been added to Part J of the Food and Drug Regulations thereby prohibiting the production, export or import of the substance.

===China===

As of October 2015 TFMPP is a controlled substance in China.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sfda.gov.cn/WS01/CL0056/130753.html | title=关于印发《非药用类麻醉药品和精神药品列管办法》的通知 | publisher=China Food and Drug Administration | date=27 September 2015 | language=Chinese | accessdate=1 October 2015}}</ref>

===Denmark===
As of December 3, 2005, TFMPP is illegal in [[Denmark]].

===Japan===
Since 2003, TFMPP and BZP became illegal in [[Japan]].

===Netherlands===
TFMPP is unscheduled in the [[Netherlands]].

===New Zealand===
Based on the recommendation of the EACD, the [[New Zealand]] government has passed legislation which placed BZP, along with the other piperazine derivatives TFMPP, mCPP, pFPP, MeOPP and MBZP, into Class C of the New Zealand Misuse of Drugs Act 1975. A ban was intended to come into effect in New Zealand on December 18, 2007, but the law change did not go through until the following year, and the sale of BZP and the other listed piperazines became illegal in New Zealand as of 1 April 2008. An amnesty for possession and usage of these drugs remained until October 2008, at which point they became completely illegal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/PB/Legislation/Bills/d/3/d/00DBHOH_BILL8220_1-Misuse-of-Drugs-Classification-of-BZP-Amendment.htm |title=Misuse of Drugs (Classification of BZP) Amendment Bill 2008}}</ref>

===United Kingdom===
As of December 2009, TFMPP has been made a Class C drug in the [[United Kingdom]] along with BZP.

===United States===
TFMPP is not currently scheduled at the federal level in the [[United States]],<ref name="PART 1308 — SCHEDULES OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES - 1308.11 Schedule I">[http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1308/1308_11.htm §1308.11 Schedule I.]</ref> but it was briefly emergency scheduled in [[Schedule I (US)|Schedule I]].  The scheduling expired in April 2004 and was not renewed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/sched_actions/2002/fr09202.htm |title=Scheduling Actions 2002 |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)}}</ref> However, some states such as Florida have banned the drug in their criminal statutes making its possession a felony.<ref name="Florida Statutes - Chapter 893 - DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION AND CONTROL">[http://leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0800-0899/0893/0893.html Florida Statutes - Chapter 893 - DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION AND CONTROL]</ref>

====Florida====
TFMPP is a Schedule I [[controlled substance]] in the state of [[Florida]] making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess in Florida.<ref name="Florida Statutes - Chapter 893 - DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION AND CONTROL"/>

====Texas====
TFMPP is not scheduled in [[Texas]]. It was briefly Schedule I, but was removed from Schedule I in Texas after the US federal government dropped its federal Schedule I status.
