'''Loprazolam'''<ref>US Patent 4044142</ref> ('''triazulenone''') marketed under the brand names '''Dormonoct''', '''Havlane''', '''Sonin''' and '''Somnovit,''' is a drug which is an imidazolo[[benzodiazepine]] derivative. It possesses [[anxiolytic]], [[anticonvulsant]], [[hypnotic]], [[sedative]] and [[skeletal muscle relaxant]] properties. It is available in 1&nbsp;mg and 2&nbsp;mg tablets. It is licensed and marketed for the short-term treatment of moderately-severe insomnia.

==Indications==
Insomnia can be described as a difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakening, early awakenings or a combination of each. Loprazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine and is sometimes used in patients who have difficulty in maintaining sleep or have difficulty falling asleep. Hypnotics should only be used on a short-term basis or in those with chronic insomnia on an occasional basis.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Rickels K. | year = 1986 | title = The clinical use of hypnotics: indications for use and the need for a variety of hypnotics | journal = [[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]] Suppl. | volume = 74 | issue = S332 | pages = 132&ndash;41 | pmid = 2883820 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1986.tb08990.x }}</ref>

==Dose==
The dose of loprazolam for [[insomnia]] is usually 1&nbsp;mg but can be increased to 2&nbsp;mg if necessary. In the elderly a lower dose is recommended due to more pronounced effects and a significant impairment of standing up to 11 hours after dosing of 1&nbsp;mg of loprazolam. The [[half-life]] is much more prolonged in the elderly than in younger patients. A half-life of 19.8 hours has been reported in elderly patients.<ref name="ncbi">{{cite web

==Side effects==
Side effects of loprazolam are generally the same as for other benzodiazepines such as [[diazepam]].<ref>[http://www.bnf.org.uk/bnf/bnf/53/3141.htm British National Formulary Benzodiazepines Information]</ref> The most significant difference in side effects of loprazolam and diazepam is it is less prone to day time sedation as the half-life of loprazolam is considered to be intermediate whereas diazepam has a very long half-life. The side effects of loprazolam are the following:

* [[drowsiness]]
* paradoxical increase in aggression
* [[lightheadedness]]
* [[confusion]]
* muscle weakness
* [[ataxia]] (particularly in the elderly)
* [[amnesia]]
* [[headache]]
* [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]]
* [[hypotension]]
*salivation changes
* gastro-intestinal disturbances
* visual disturbances
* [[dysarthria]]
* [[tremor]]
* changes in [[libido]]
* [[urinary incontinence|incontinence]]
* [[urinary retention]]
* [[blood disorders]] and [[jaundice]]
* [[skin]] reactions
* dependence and withdrawal reactions

Residual 'hangover' effects after nighttime administration of loprazolam such as sleepiness, impaired psychomotor and [[cognitive]] functions may persist into the next day which may increase risks of falls and [[hip fractures]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Vermeeren A. | year = 2004 | month = | title = Residual effects of hypnotics: epidemiology and clinical implications | journal = CNS Drugs. | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 297&ndash;328 | pmid = 15089115 | doi = 10.2165/00023210-200418050-00003 }}</ref>

==Tolerance, dependence and withdrawal==
Loprazolam, like all other benzodiazepines, is recommended only for the short-term management of insomnia in the UK, owing to the risk of serious adverse effects such as tolerance, dependence and withdrawal, as well as adverse effects on mood and cognition. Benzodiazepines can become less effective over time, and patients can develop increasing physical and psychological adverse effects, e.g., agorophobia, gastrointestinal complaints, and peripheral nerve abnormalities such as burning and tingling sensations.<ref name="benzo">{{cite web| author= Committee on Safety of Medicines| year= 1988| url= http://www.benzo.org.uk/commit.htm| title= BENZODIAZEPINES, DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS| publisher= Medicines Control Agency UK Government| accessdate= 2007-03-21}}</ref><ref name="ash">{{cite web| author= Professor C Heather Ashton| year= 1987| url= http://www.benzo.org.uk/ashbzoc.htm| title= Benzodiazepine Withdrawal: Outcome in 50 Patients| publisher= benzo| accessdate= 2007-03-21}}</ref>

Loprazolam has a low risk of [[physical dependence]] and withdrawal if it is used for less than 4 weeks or very occasionally. However, one placebo-controlled study comparing 3 weeks of treatment for [[insomnia]] with either loprazolam or [[triazolam]] showed rebound [[anxiety]] and insomnia occurring 3 days after discontinuing loprazolam therapy, whereas with triazolam the rebound anxiety and insomnia was seen the next day. The differences between the two are likely due to the differing elimination half-lives of the two drugs.<ref name="pubmedcentral">{{cite web|vauthors=Morgan K, Oswald I | year= 1982| url= http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1496517&blobtype=pdf| title= Anxiety caused by a short-life hypnotic| publisher= British medical journal (Clinical research ed.)| accessdate= 2007-03-21}}</ref><ref name="entrez">{{cite web|vauthors=Morgan K, Adam K, Oswald I | year= 1984| url= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=6145178&query_hl=1&itool=pubmed_DocSum| title= Effect of loprazolam and of triazolam on psychological functions| publisher= Psychopharmacology| accessdate= 2007-03-21}}</ref> These results would suggest that loprazolam and possibly other benzodiazepines should be prescribed for 1–2 weeks rather than 2–4 weeks to reduce the risk of physical dependence, withdrawal, and rebound phenomenon.

'''Withdrawal symptoms'''
Slow reduction of the dosage over a period of months at a rate that the individual can tolerate greatly minimizes the severity of the withdrawal symptoms. Individuals who are [[benzodiazepine dependent]] often cross to an equivalent dose of [[diazepam]] to taper gradually, as diazepam has a longer half-life and small dose reductions can be achieved more easily.<ref name="ashton">{{cite web| author= McConnell JG| year= 2007| url= http://www.bcnc.org.uk/whyvalium.html| title= The Clinicopharmacotherapeutics of Benzodiazepine and Z drug dose Tapering Using Diazepam| publisher= BCNC| accessdate= 2007-06-09}}</ref><ref>(Roche Products (UK) Ltd 1990) [http://www.benzo.org.uk/roche1.htm  Benzodiazepines and Your Patients: A Management Programme]</ref>

==Contraindications and special caution==
Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with [[comorbid]] [[psychiatric disorders]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Authier | first1 = N. | last2 = Balayssac | first2 = D. | last3 = Sautereau | first3 = M. | last4 = Zangarelli | first4 = A. | last5 = Courty | first5 = P. | last6 = Somogyi | first6 = AA. | last7 = Vennat | first7 = B. | last8 = Llorca | first8 = PM. | last9 = Eschalier | first9 = A. | title = Benzodiazepine dependence: focus on withdrawal syndrome | journal = Ann Pharm Fr | volume = 67 | issue = 6 | pages = 408–13 |date=Nov 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharma.2009.07.001 | pmid = 19900604  }}</ref> Loprazolam, similar to other benzodiazepines and [[nonbenzodiazepine]] [[hypnotic]] drugs causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. The combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial, but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments.<ref name="Mets-2010">{{Cite journal | last1 = Mets | first1 = MA. | last2 = Volkerts | first2 = ER. | last3 = Olivier | first3 = B. | last4 = Verster | first4 = JC. | title = Effect of hypnotic drugs on body balance and standing steadiness | journal = Sleep Med Rev | volume = 14 |date=Feb 2010 | issue = 4 | pages = 259–67 | doi = 10.1016/j.smrv.2009.10.008 | pmid = 20171127 }}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Loprazolam is a benzodiazepine, which acts via positively modulating the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor complex via a binding to the [[benzodiazepine]] receptor which is situated on alpha subunit containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. This action enhances the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA on the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor complex by increasing the opening frequency of the chloride ion channel. This action allows more chloride ions to enter the neuron which in turn produces such effects as; muscle relaxation, [[anxiolytic]], hypnotic, [[amnesic]] and [[anticonvulsant]] action. These properties can be used for therapeutic benefit in clinical practice. These properties are also sometimes used for recreational purposes in the form of drug abuse of [[benzodiazepines]] where high doses are used to achieve [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]] and or sedation.<ref name="ingenta">{{cite web | author= Bateson AN | year= 2002

==Pharmacokinetics==
After oral administration of loprazolam on an empty stomach, it takes 2 hours for serum concentration levels to peak, significantly longer than other benzodiazepine hypnotics. This delay brings into question the benefit of loprazolam for the treatment of insomnia when compared to other hypnotics (particularly when the major complaint is difficulty falling asleep instead of difficulty maintaining sleep for the entire night), although some studies show that loprazolam may induce sleep within half an hour, indicating rapid penetration into the brain. The peak plasma delay of loprazolam, therefore, may not be relevant to loprazolam's efficacy as a hypnotic. If taken after a meal it can take even longer for loprazolam plasma levels to peak and peak levels may be lower than normal. Loprazolam significantly alters electrical activity in the brain as measured by [[EEG]], with these changes becoming more pronounced as the dose increases. Roughly half of each dose is [[metabolize]]d in humans to produce an active metabolite with similar potency to loprazolam, the other half is excreted unchanged. The half-life of the active metabolite is about the same as the parent compound loprazolam.<ref name="jcp">{{cite journal|vauthors=Mamelak M, Bunting P, Galin H, Price V, Csima A, Young T, Klein D, Pelchat JR | year= 1988| title= Serum and quantitative electroencephalographic pharmacokinetics of loprazolam in the elderly | journal= Journal of clinical pharmacology | pmid=3392236 | volume=28 | issue=4 | pages=376–83 | doi=10.1002/j.1552-4604.1988.tb03162.x}}</ref>
