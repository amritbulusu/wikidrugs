'''Paramethadione''' (brand name '''Paradione''') is an [[anticonvulsant]] in the [[oxazolidinedione]] class developed by the Illinois-based pharmaceutical company [[Abbott Laboratories]] (known as [[AbbVie]] since January 1, 2013 <ref>[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-12-30/business/ct-biz-1230-bf-abbott-spin-20121230_1_longtime-abbott-executive-abbvie-abbott-laboratories More than splitting pills: Health care giant Abbott Laboratories ready to spin off AbbVie] - Retrieved November 7, 2016</ref>), and approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] in 1949 for the treatment of [[absence seizures]], also called [[partial seizures]].<ref>[https://www.drugs.com/drug-class/oxazolidinedione-anticonvulsants.html Oxazolidinedione Anticonvulsants] - Retrieved January 2007.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Sittig|first1=Marshall|title=Pharmaceutical manufacturing encyclopedia.|date=2015|publisher=William Andrew Pub.|location=New York}}</ref>

In 1960, the yearly cost for 900&nbsp;mg/day paramethadione was approximately $66,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lennox|first1=W.G.|title=Epilepsy and related disorders.|date=1960|publisher=Little Brown|location=Boston}}</ref> which would translate to $462 yearly in 2007 (with CPI inflation) if paramethadione was still sold.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Shorvon |first=S.D.|date= 2009|title=Drug treatment of epilepsy in the century of the ILAE: The second 50 years, 1959–2009|journal=Epilepsia|volume=50|issue=s3 |pages=93–130|doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2009.02042.x |pmid=19298435}}</ref>

==Mechanism of Action==
Paramethadione acts to reduce T-type calcium currents in thalamic neurons which has been proposed to underlie the 3-Hz spike-and-wave discharge seen on electroencephalogram (EEG) during [[absence seizures]].<ref>[https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00617 Drug Bank- Paramethadione] Retrieved November 21, 2016</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Von Krosigk |first=M.|last2=Bal |first2=T.|last3=McCormick |first3=D.

==Adverse Effects==
Paramethadione is associated with various adverse effects including sedation, increased visual sensitivity to light, GI distress, edema, nephropathy, neutropenia, myasthenia gravis-like syndrome, fatal aplastic anemia, and severe birth defects known as [[fetal trimethadione syndrome]] (or [[paramethadione syndrome]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Miller |first=R.R.|last2=Greenblatt |first2=D.J.|title=Handbook of Drug Therapy|year=1979|publisher=Elsevier North Holland|location=New York}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/jablonski/syndrome_cgi?term=paramethadione+syndrome&field=name Multiple Congenital Anomaly/Mental Retardation (MCA/MR) Syndromes] - Retrieved January 2007.</ref>

==History, society, and culture==

===FDA approval===
Paramethadione (brand name Paradione) was originally approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1949, as a second-line treatment for [[petit mal]] and [[absence seizures]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=R.R.|last2=Greenblatt|first2=D.J.|title=Handbook of Drug Therapy|date=1979|publisher=Elsevier North Holland|location=New York|page=597}}</ref> Paramethadione was ultimately discontinued in 1994 due to safety and efficacy concerns,<ref>[http://www.reference.md/files/PA/PARADIONE.html Drug information for PARADIONE]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Shorvon |first=S.D.|date= 2009|title=Drug treatment of epilepsy in the century of the ILAE: The second 50 years, 1959–2009|journal=Epilepsia|volume=50|issue=s3 |pages=93–130|doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2009.02042.x |pmid=19298435}}</ref> such as being associated with [[fetal trimethadione syndrome]], which is also known as [[paramethadione syndrome]].<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/jablonski/syndrome_cgi?term=paramethadione+syndrome&field=name Multiple Congenital Anomaly/Mental Retardation (MCA/MR) Syndromes] - Retrieved January 2007.</ref>

===Patents===
Paramethadione was first patented in 1949 ({{US Patent|2575693}}) by [[Abbott Laboratories]].<ref>M.A. Spielman, {{US Patent|2575693}} (1951)</ref> Abbott Labbortories continued to hold the patent to paramethadione until the approval was withdrawn in 2004 due to the drug no longer being in use.<ref>{{cite report|author=Schering Corp. et al.|date=2004|title=Withdrawal of Approval of 92 New Drug Applications and 49 Abbreviated New Drug Applications|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2004/05/05/04-10194/schering-corp-et-al-withdrawal-of-approval-of-92-new-drug-applications-and-49-abbreviated-new-drug|publisher=DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES: Food and Drug Administration|page=25125 |docket=Docket No. 2004N-0159}}</ref>

===Clinical Trials===
In the 1940s [[trimethadione]] (brand name '''Tridione''') was the only available treatment for absence seizures. However, while effective, this drug presented with significant adverse effects, which led to the search for an equally effective analog. While limited information is available from the time, a pre-market clinical study found that paramethadione, an analog of trimethadione, was not quite as effective at alleviating seizures as trimethadione, however, it did have a significantly lower side effect profile in 85 patients over the course of 2 years.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Davis |first=J.P.|last2=Davis |first2=W.G |date= 1949|title=A comparison of paradione and tridione in the treatment of epilepsy |journal=The Journal of Pediatrics|volume=34|issue=3 |pages=273–278|doi=10.1016/S0022-3476(49)80080-1}}</ref> Notably, 80% of patients still showed a good response to paramethadione.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ebaugh |first=F.G.|last2=Drake |first2=F.R. |date= 1955|title=The current drug therapy of epilepsy: a review. |journal=The American journal of the medical sciences|volume=230|issue=1 |pages=98–107 |doi=10.1097/00000441-195507000-00014}}</ref>

==Chemistry==
Paramethadione, 5-ethyl-3,5-dimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione, differs from [[trimethadione]] only in the substitution of one methyl group with an ethyl group. It is synthesized in a completely analogous manner, except that it comes from 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutyric acid instead of 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid.
