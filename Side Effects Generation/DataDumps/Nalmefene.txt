'''Nalmefene''' (trade name '''Selincro'''), originally known as '''nalmetrene''', is an [[opioid antagonist]] used primarily in the management of [[alcohol dependence]]. It has also been investigated for the treatment of other addictions such as [[pathological gambling]].<ref>[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00132119?term=nalmefene&rank=6 NCT00132119] ClinicalTrials.gov</ref>

Nalmefene is an [[opiate]] derivative similar in both structure and activity to the opioid antagonist [[naltrexone]]. Advantages of nalmefene relative to naltrexone include longer half-life, greater oral bioavailability and no observed dose-dependent liver toxicity.<ref name=livertox/>

As with other drugs of this type, nalmefene may precipitate acute withdrawal symptoms in patients who are dependent on opioid drugs, or more rarely when used post-operatively, to counteract the effects of strong opioids used in [[surgery]].

==Medical uses==

===Opioid overdose===
[[Intravenous]] doses of nalmefene have been shown effective at counteracting the respiratory depression produced by opiate overdose,<ref>Label information. [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013033351/http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2000/20459S2lbl.pdf |date=October 13, 2006 }}</ref> although this is not the usual application for this drug as [[naloxone]] is less expensive.

Doses greater than 1.5&nbsp;mg do not appear to give any greater benefit in this application. The half-life of nalmefene is longer than that of naloxone, which might make it useful for treating overdose involving longer acting opioids such as [[methadone]], in that it would require less frequent dosing and hence reduce the likelihood of renarcotization as the antagonist wears off.

===Alcohol dependence===
Nalmefene is used in Europe to reduce alcohol dependence<ref name=UKlabel>{{cite web|title=Selincro 18mg film-coated tablets|url=https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/27609|publisher=UK Electronic Medicines Compendium|language=en|date=September 2016}}</ref> and NICE recommends the use of nalmefene to reduce alcohol consumption in combination with psychological support for people who drink heavily.<ref>{{cite web|title=Technology appraisal guidance [TA325]: Nalmefene for reducing alcohol consumption in people with alcohol dependence|url=https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta325/chapter/1-Guidance|publisher=NICE|date=26 November 2014}}</ref>

Based on a meta analysis, the usefulness of nalmefene for alcohol dependence is unclear.<ref name=Pal2015>{{cite journal|last1=Palpacuer|first1=C|last2=Laviolle|first2=B|last3=Boussageon|first3=R|last4=Reymann|first4=JM|last5=Bellissant|first5=E|last6=Naudet|first6=F|title=Risks and benefits of nalmefene in the treatment of adult alcohol dependence: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of published and unpublished double-blind randomized controlled trials |journal=PLOS Medicine|date=December 2015|volume=12|issue=12|pages=e1001924|pmid=26694529|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001924|pmc=4687857}}</ref> Nalmefene, in combination with psychosocial management, may decrease the amount of alcohol drank in people who are alcohol dependent.<ref name=Pal2015/><ref name=PM2014/> The medication may also be taken "as needed", when a person feels the urge to consume alcohol.<ref name=PM2014>{{cite journal|first1=François |last1=Paille |first2=Hervé |last2=Martini |title=Nalmefene: a new approach to the treatment of alcohol dependence |journal=Substance Abuse and Rehabilitation|year=2014|volume=5|number=5|pages=87–94|pmid=25187751|doi=10.2147/sar.s45666|pmc=4133028}}</ref>

==Side effects==
The most common side effects (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) were nausea (feeling sick), dizziness, insomnia (difficulty sleeping), and headache. The majority or these reactions were mild or moderate and of short duration.<ref>{{cite web|title=Selincro|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/002583/human_med_001620.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d124|website=European Medicines Agency|accessdate=3 November 2015}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Nalmefene acts as a [[silent antagonist]] of the [[μ-opioid receptor]] (MOR) (K<sub>i</sub> = 0.24 nM) and as a weak [[partial agonist]] (K<sub>i</sub> = 0.083 nM; [[intrinsic activity|E<sub>max</sub>]] = 20–30%) of the [[κ-opioid receptor]] (KOR), with similar affinity for these two receptors but a several-fold preference for the KOR.<ref name="BartSchluger2005">{{cite journal|last1=Bart|first1=G|last2=Schluger|first2=JH|last3=Borg|first3=L|last4=Ho|first4=A|last5=Bidlack|first5=JM|last6=Kreek|first6=MJ|title=Nalmefene induced elevation in serum prolactin in normal human volunteers: partial kappa opioid agonist activity?|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |date=December 2005|volume=30|issue=12|pages=2254–62|doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1300811|pmid=15988468|url=https://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v30/n12/pdf/1300811a.pdf}}</ref>

Nalmefene is structurally related to naltrexone and differs from it by substitution of the [[ketone]] group at the 6-position of naltrexone with a [[methylene group]] (CH<sub>2</sub>). It binds to the MOR with similar affinity relative to naltrexone, but binds "somewhat more avidly" to the KOR and DOR in comparison.<ref name="BartSchluger2005" /><ref name="NiciuArias2013" />

===Pharmacokinetics===
Nalmefene is extensively metabolized in the liver, mainly by conjugation with [[glucuronic acid]] and also by ''N''-dealkylation. Less than 5% of the dose is excreted unchanged. The [[glucuronide]] metabolite is entirely inactive, while the ''N''-dealkylated metabolite has minimal pharmacological activity.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Chemistry==
Nalmefene is a derivative of [[naltrexone]] and was first reported in 1975.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fulton|first1=Brian S.|title=Drug Discovery for the Treatment of Addiction: Medicinal Chemistry Strategies|date=2014|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781118889572|page=341|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M5E_BAAAQBAJ&pg=PT341|language=en}}</ref>

==Society and culture==
===United States===
In the US, immediate-release injectable nalmefene was approved in 1995 as an antidote for opioid overdose. It was sold under the trade name Revex. The product was discontinued by its manufacturer around 2008.<ref>See: {{cite web|title=Baxter discontinues Revex injection|url=http://www.empr.com/news/baxter-discontinues-revex-injection/article/122431/|website=Monthly Prescribing Reference website|publisher=Haymarket Media, Inc|accessdate=10 October 2016|date=9 July 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Drug Shortages|url=http://www.fda.gov/Cder/drug/shortages/default.htm|publisher=FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226211459/http://www.fda.gov/Cder/drug/shortages/default.htm|archivedate=26 December 2008}}</ref> Perhaps, due to its price, it never sold well. (See {{section link||Opioid overdose}}, above.)

Nalmefene in [[Pill (pharmacy)|pill]] form, which is used to treat alcohol dependence and other addictive behaviors, has never been sold in the United States.<ref name=livertox>See: {{cite web|title=Drug Record: Nalmefene |work=LiverTox |publisher=[[National Library of Medicine]] |date=24 March 2016 |url=http://livertox.nih.gov/Nalmefene.htm }}</ref>
