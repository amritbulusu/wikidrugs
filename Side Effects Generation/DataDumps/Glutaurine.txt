'''Glutaurine''' is a chemical compound which is an [[amide]] formed from [[glutamic acid]] and [[taurine]].

==Biological role==


Glutaurine, an endogenous compound (KEGG: C05844), has been noted as an antiepileptic, with antiamnesia properties. The dipeptide γ-glutamyltaurine (γ-GT; glutaurine, Litoralon) was discovered in the parathyroid in 1980, and later in the mammalian brain. This led to studies on intrinsic and synthetic taurine peptides, and the suggestion that γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT; γ-glutamyl-transpeptidase) in the brain is responsible for its ''in vivo'' formation.<ref name="Bittner">Bittner S et al (2005) [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00726-005-0196-7 γ-L-glutamyltaurine]. ''Amino Acids'', 28(4): 343-356</ref>

The versatile molecule mimicks the anxiolytic drug [[diazepam]], and is implicated in phenomena from feline aggression to amphibian metamorphosis, radiation protection and the glutamatergic system in schizophrenic disorders.<ref name="Bittner" />
