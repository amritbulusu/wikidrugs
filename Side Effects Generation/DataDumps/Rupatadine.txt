'''Rupatadine''' is a second generation [[antihistamine]] and [[Platelet-activating factor|PAF]] antagonist used to treat allergies. It was discovered and developed by J. [[Uriach y Cia]]<ref>Patents: {{Patent|EP|577957}}, {{Patent|US|5407941}}, {{Patent|US|5476856}}</ref> and is marketed as '''Rupafin''' and under several other trade names.

== Medical uses ==
Rupatadine fumarate has been approved for the treatment of [[allergic rhinitis]] and chronic urticaria in adults and children over 12 years. It is available as round, light salmon coloured tablets containing 10&nbsp;mg of rupatadine (as fumarate) to be administered orally, once a day.<ref>[https://www.drugs.com/uk/pdf/leaflet/841244.pdf?download=1 UK package leaflet for Rupafin].</ref>

The efficacy of rupatadine as treatment for allergic rhinitis (AR) and [[chronic idiopathic urticaria]] (CIU) has been investigated in adults and adolescents (aged over 12 years) in several controlled studies, showing a rapid onset of action and a good safety profile even in prolonged treatment periods of a year.<ref name="picardo" /><ref>{{Cite journal

== Side effects ==
Rupatadine is a non-[[sedating]] antihistamine. However, as in other non sedating second-generation antihistamines, the most common side effects in controlled clinical studies were [[somnolence]], [[headache]]s and [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]].

== Pharmacology ==

=== Mechanism of action ===
Rupatadine is a second generation, non-sedating, long-acting histamine antagonist with selective peripheral H<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist activity. It further blocks the receptors of the platelet-activating factor (PAF) according to in vitro and in vivo studies.<ref>{{Cite journal

Rupatadine possesses anti-allergic properties such as the inhibition of the [[degranulation]] of [[mast cell]]s induced by immunological and non-immunological stimuli, and inhibition of the release of [[cytokine]]s, particularly of the [[tumor necrosis factors]] (TNF) in human mast cells and [[monocyte]]s.<ref name="picardo">{{Cite journal

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Rupatadine has several [[active metabolite]]s such as [[desloratadine]], 3-hydroxydesloratadine,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Influence of food on the oral bioavailability of rupatadine tablets in healthy volunteers: a single-dose, randomized, open-label, two-way crossover study|journal=Clinical Therapeutics|volume=29|issue=5|pages=900–8|pmid=17697908|year=2007|author1=Solans|first1=A|last2=Carbó|first2=M.
