The [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] '''pseudoephedrine hydrochloride''' and '''pseudoephedrine sulfate''' are found in many [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] [[dosage form|preparations]], either as a single ingredient or (more commonly) in combination with [[antihistamine]]s, [[guaifenesin]], [[dextromethorphan]], and/or [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) or an [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAID]] (such as [[aspirin]] or [[ibuprofen]]).

==Chemistry==
Pseudoephedrine is a [[diastereomer]] of [[ephedrine]] and is readily [[redox|reduced]] into [[methamphetamine]] or [[oxidized]] into [[methcathinone]].

[[File:(pseudo)ephedrine enantiomers.svg|thumb|400px|Two pairs of [[enantiomers]]: [[ephedrine]] (top) and pseudoephedrine (bottom)]]

==Nomenclatures==
The [[Levorotation and dextrorotation|dextrorotary]] (+)- or d- [[enantiomer]] is (1''S'',2''S'')-pseudoephedrine, whereas the levorotating (−)- or l- form is (1''R'',2''R'')-pseudoephedrine.

In the outdated [[Chirality (chemistry)#By configuration: D- and L-|{{smallcaps|d/l}} system]] (+)-pseudoephedrine is also referred to as {{smallcaps|l-}}pseudoephedrine and (−)-pseudoephedrine as {{smallcaps|d-}}pseudoephedrine (in the [[Fisher projection]] then the phenyl ring is drawn at bottom).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Popat N. Patil, A. Tye and J.B. LaPidus  | url = http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/148/2/158.abstract | title = A pharmacological study of the ephedrine isomers | journal = JPET | year = 1965 |  volume = 148 | issue = 2 | pages = 158–168 | pmid = 14301006}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| editor= Edited by Reynolds JEF | title=[[Martindale: The complete drug reference]] | edition=29th | year=1989 | publisher=Pharmaceutical Press | location=London | isbn= 0-85369-210-6 | author= Martindale}}</ref>

Often the {{smallcaps|d/l}} system (with [[small caps]]) and the d/l system (with [[lower-case]]) are confused. The result is that the dextrorotary d-pseudoephedrine is wrongly named {{smallcaps|d-}}pseudoephedrine and the levorotary l-ephedrine (the diastereomer) wrongly {{smallcaps|l-}}ephedrine.

The IUPAC names of the two enantiomers are (1''S'',2''S'')- respectively (1''R'',2''R'')-2-methylamino-1-phenylpropan-1-ol. Synonyms for both are ''psi''-ephedrine and ''threo''-ephedrine.

Pseudoephedrine is the [[International Nonproprietary Name]] of the (+)-form, when used as pharmaceutical substance.<ref>[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/inn/proposed_lists/prop_INN_list11.pdf ''Proposed International Non-Proprietary Names (Prop. I.N.N.): List 11''] WHO Chronicle, Vol. 15, No. 8, August 1961, pp. 314–20</ref>

==Synthesis==
Although pseudoephedrine occurs naturally as an [[alkaloid]] in certain plant species (for example, as a constituent of extracts from the ''[[Ephedra]]'' species, also known as ''ma huang'', in which it occurs together with other isomers of [[ephedrine]]), the majority of pseudoephedrine produced for commercial use is derived from [[yeast]] [[fermentation]] of [[dextrose]] in the presence of [[benzaldehyde]]. In this process, specialized strains of yeast (typically a variety of ''[[Candida utilis]]'' or ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'') are added to large vats containing water, dextrose and the enzyme [[pyruvate decarboxylase]] (such as found in [[beet]]s and other plants). After the yeast has begun fermenting the dextrose, the benzaldehyde is added to the vats, and in this environment the yeast converts the ingredients to the precursor [[l-phenylacetylcarbinol]] (L-PAC). L-PAC is then chemically converted to pseudoephedrine via [[reductive amination]].<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Oliver AL, Anderson BN, Roddick FA |title=Factors affecting the production of L-phenylacetylcarbinol by yeast: a case study |journal=Adv. Microb. Physiol. |volume=41 |issue= |pages=1–45 |year=1999 |pmid=10500843 |doi= 10.1016/S0065-2911(08)60164-2|url=|series=Advances in Microbial Physiology|isbn=978-0-12-027741-4}}</ref>

The bulk of pseudoephedrine is produced by commercial [[pharmaceutical manufacturers]] in [[India]] and [[China]], where economic and industrial conditions favor its mass production for export.<ref>Suo, Steve. Clamp down on shipments of raw ingredients. The Oregonian; 6 October 2004.

==Mechanism of action==
Pseudoephedrine is a [[sympathomimetic]] [[amine]]. Its principal mechanism of action relies on its direct action on the [[adrenergic receptor]] system.<ref name="American Medical Association, AMA Department of Drugs 1977 627">{{cite book|last=American Medical Association, AMA Department of Drugs|title=AMA Drug Evaluations|date=1977|publisher=PSG Publishing Co., Inc.|page=627}}</ref><ref name="Thomson/Micromedex 2007 2452">{{cite book|last=Thomson/Micromedex|title=Drug Information for the Health Care Professional, Volume 1,|date=2007|location=Greenwood Village, CO.|page=2452}}</ref>  The [[vasoconstriction]] that pseudoephedrine produces is believed to be principally an α-adrenergic receptor response.<ref name='drew'>{{cite journal | pmc = 1429447 | year = 1978 | last1 = Drew | first1 = CD | last2 = Knight | first2 = GT | last3 = Hughes | first3 = DT | last4 = Bush | first4 = M | title = Comparison of the effects of D-(−)-ephedrine and L-(+)-pseudoephedrine on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems in man | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 221–225 | journal = British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.1978.tb04588.x | pmid=687500}}</ref>

Pseudoephedrine acts on α- and β2-adrenergic receptors, to cause vasoconstriction and relaxation of smooth muscle in the bronchi, respectively.<ref name="American Medical Association, AMA Department of Drugs 1977 627"/><ref name="Thomson/Micromedex 2007 2452"/> α-adrenergic receptors are located on the muscles lining the walls of blood vessels. When these receptors are activated, the muscles contract, causing the blood vessels to constrict (vasoconstriction). The constricted blood vessels now allow less fluid to leave the blood vessels and enter the nose, throat and sinus linings, which results in decreased inflammation of nasal membranes, as well as decreased mucus production. Thus, by constriction of blood vessels, mainly those located in the nasal passages, pseudoephedrine causes a decrease in the symptoms of nasal congestion. Activation of β2-adrenergic receptors produces relaxation of smooth muscle of the bronchi,<ref name="American Medical Association, AMA Department of Drugs 1977 627"/>  causing bronchial dilation and in turn decreasing congestion (although not fluid) and difficulty breathing.

==Medical uses==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2011}}
[[File:おまけ.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A selection of over-counter medications, including [[Contac]], which contains pseudoephedrine.]]
Pseudoephedrine is a [[stimulant]], but it is well known for shrinking swollen nasal mucous membranes, so it is often used as a [[decongestant]]. It reduces tissue [[hyperemia]], [[edema]], and [[nasal congestion]] commonly associated with [[common cold|colds]] or [[allergy|allergies]]. Other beneficial effects may include increasing the drainage of [[Paranasal sinus|sinus]] secretions, and opening of obstructed [[Eustachian tube]]s. The same [[vasoconstriction]] action can also result in [[hypertension]], which is a noted side effect of pseudoephedrine.

Pseudoephedrine can be used either as oral or as [[topical decongestant]]. However, due to its stimulating qualities, the topical nasal preparation is more likely to cause adverse effects, including [[urinary retention]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.auanet.org/education/urinary-incontinence.cfm|title=American Urological Association - Medical Student Curriculum - Urinary Incontinence|publisher=American Urological Association|accessdate=2015-08-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishjournalpediatrics.org/?fullTextId=481&lang=eng |title=Acute urinary retention due to pseudoephedrine hydrochloride in a 3-year-old child |publisher=The Turkish Journal of Pediatrics |accessdate=2015-08-12}}</ref> According to one study, pseudoephedrine may show effectiveness as an [[antitussive]] drug (suppression of [[Cough medicine|cough]]).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kiyoshi Minamizawa | url = http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jphs/102/1/102_136/_article | title = Effect of d-Pseudoephedrine on Cough Reflex and Its Mode of Action in Guinea Pigs | journal = Journal of Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 102  | year = 2006 | issue = 1 | pages = 136–142 | doi = 10.1254/jphs.FP0060526 | pmid = 16974066  | displayauthors = etal  }}</ref>

===Indications===
{{refimprove section|date=December 2011}}
Pseudoephedrine is indicated for the treatment of nasal congestion, sinus congestion and [[Eustachian tube]] congestion.<ref name="Bicopoulos">Bicopoulos D, editor. AusDI: Drug information for the healthcare professional, 2nd edition. Castle Hill: Pharmaceutical Care Information Services; 2002.</ref> Pseudoephedrine is also indicated for [[vasomotor rhinitis]], and as an adjunct to other agents in the optimum treatment of [[allergic rhinitis]], [[croup]], [[sinusitis]], [[otitis media]], and [[tracheobronchitis]].<ref name="Bicopoulos" />

Pseudoephedrine is also used as a first-line prophylactic for recurrent [[priapism]].  [[Erection]] is largely a [[Autonomic nervous system|parasympathetic]] response, so the sympathetic action of pseudoephedrine may serve to relieve this condition. Treatment for [[urinary incontinence]] is an [[off-label use]] ("unlabeled use") for these medications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2005/0115/p315.html |title=Selecting Medications for the Treatment of Urinary Incontinence – January 15, 2005 – American Family Physician |publisher=Aafp.org |accessdate=2012-05-06}}</ref>

===Adverse effects===
Common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with pseudoephedrine therapy include [[central nervous system]] stimulation, insomnia, nervousness, excitability, dizziness and anxiety. Infrequent ADRs include [[tachycardia]] or [[palpitation]]s. Rarely, pseudoephedrine therapy may be associated with [[mydriasis]] (dilated pupils), [[hallucination]]s, [[arrhythmia]]s, [[hypertension]], seizures and [[ischemic colitis]];<ref name="Rossi">Rossi S, editor. [[Australian Medicines Handbook]] 2006.

It has also been reported that pseudoephedrine, among other [[sympathomimetics|sympathomimetic]] agents, may be associated with the occurrence of [[stroke]].<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Cantu C, Arauz A, Murillo-Bonilla LM, López M, Barinagarrementeria F |title=Stroke associated with sympathomimetics contained in over-the-counter cough and cold drugs |journal=Stroke |volume=34 |issue=7 |pages=1667–72 |date=July 2003 |pmid=12791938 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000075293.45936.FA  }}</ref>

===Precautions and contraindications===
Pseudoephedrine is contraindicated in patients with [[diabetes mellitus]], [[cardiovascular disease]], severe or uncontrolled [[hypertension]], severe [[coronary artery disease]], [[prostatic hypertrophy]], [[hyperthyroidism]], [[closed angle glaucoma]], or by pregnant women.<ref name="Rossi" /> The safety and effectiveness of nasal decongestant use in children is unclear.<ref name=Deckx2016>{{cite journal|first1=Laura|last1=Deckx|first2=An Im|last2=De Sutter|first3=Linda|last3=Guo|first4=Nabiel A.|last4=Mir|title=Nasal decongestants in monotherapy for the common cold|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=17 October 2016|pages=CD009612|volume=10|pmid=27748955|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009612.pub2|first5=Mieke L.|last5=van Driel}}</ref>

===Interactions===
Concomitant or recent (previous fourteen days) [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]] use can lead to hypertensive reactions, including [[hypertensive crises]].<ref name="Rossi" />

The antihypertensive effects of [[methyldopa]], [[mecamylamine]], [[reserpine]] and [[veratrum alkaloids]] may be reduced by sympathomimetics. [[Beta-adrenergic antagonist]]s may also interact with sympathomimetics. Increase of ectopic pacemaker activity can occur when pseudoephedrine is used concomitantly with [[digitalis]]. [[Antacids]] increase the rate of pseudoephedrine absorption, while [[kaolin]] decreases it.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Detection of use===
Pseudoephedrine may be quantitated in blood, plasma or urine to monitor any possible performance-enhancing use by athletes, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Many commercial immunoassay screening tests directed at the amphetamines cross-react appreciably with pseudoephedrine, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish pseudoephedrine from other phenethylamine derivatives. Blood or plasma pseudoephedrine concentrations are typically in the 50–300&nbsp;µg/l range in persons taking the drug therapeutically, 500–3000&nbsp;µg/l in abusers or poisoned patients and 10–70&nbsp;mg/l in cases of acute fatal overdosage.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Boland DM, Rein J, Lew EO, Hearn WL |title=Fatal cold medication intoxication in an infant |journal=J Anal Toxicol |volume=27 |issue=7 |pages=523–6 |year=2003 |pmid=14607011 |doi=10.1093/jat/27.7.523 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author = R.

==National legislation==

===Australia===
[[File:VM 0237 sale pharmacy.jpg|thumb|A warning at an Australian pharmacy]]
Illicit diversion of pseudoephedrine in Australia has caused significant changes to the way the products are regulated. {{As of|2006}}, all products containing pseudoephedrine have been rescheduled as either "Pharmacist Only Medicines" (Schedule 3) or "Prescription Only Medicines" (Schedule 4), depending on the amount of pseudoephedrine in the product. A Pharmacist Only Medicine may only be sold to the public if a pharmacist is directly involved in the transaction. These medicines must be kept behind the counter, away from public access.

Pharmacists are also encouraged (and in some states required) to log purchases with the online database Project STOP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.innovationrx.com.au/OurProducts/ProjectSTOP.aspx |title=Project STOP video – Online Advertising |publisher=Innovationrx.com.au |accessdate=2012-05-06}}</ref> This system aims to prevent individuals from purchasing small quantities of pseudoephedrine from many different pharmacies.

As a result, many pharmacies no longer stock Sudafed, the common brand of pseudoephedrine cold/sinus tablets, opting instead to sell Sudafed PE, a [[phenylephrine]] product which has not been proven effective in clinical trials.<ref name="pmid17264159"/><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 19230461 | year = 2009 | last1 = Horak | first1 = F | last2 = Zieglmayer | first2 = P | last3 = Zieglmayer | first3 = R | last4 = Lemell | first4 = P | last5 = Yao | first5 = R | last6 = Staudinger | first6 = H | last7 = Danzig | first7 = M | title = A placebo-controlled study of the nasal decongestant effect of phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine in the Vienna Challenge Chamber | volume = 102 | issue = 2 | pages = 116–20 | doi = 10.1016/S1081-1206(10)60240-2 | journal = Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 17116124 | year = 2007 | last1 = Eccles | first1 = R | title = Substitution of phenylephrine for pseudoephedrine as a nasal decongeststant.

===Canada===
[[Health Canada]] has investigated the risks and benefits of pseudoephedrine and [[ephedrine]]/[[ephedra]]. Near the end of the study, Health Canada issued a warning on their website stating that those who are under the age of 12, or who have heart disease and may suffer from strokes, should avoid taking pseudoephedrine and ephedrine. Also, they warned that everyone should avoid taking ephedrine or pseudoephrine with other stimulants like [[caffeine]]. They also banned all products that contain both ephedrine (or pseudoephedrine) and caffeine.<ref>http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/hc-sc/2008/13279a-eng.php</ref>

Products whose only medicinal ingredient is pseudoephedrine must be kept behind the pharmacy counter. Products containing pseudoephedrine along with other medicinal ingredients may be displayed on store shelves but may be sold only in a pharmacy when a pharmacist is present.<ref>http://pharmacytechniciansletter.therapeuticresearch.com/mobile/Newsletter.aspx?nidchk=1&cs=&s=PTL&vo=1&dd=271114&dt=2&vodd=3</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.familyhealthonline.ca/fho/pharmacycare/PC_OTCdrugs_fhb07.asp|title=Family Health Online - Family Health Magazine -PHARMACY CARE - Over-the-Counter Medication - Why must I ask for that?|publisher=|accessdate=18 August 2016}}</ref>

In New Zealand, pseudoephedrine is currently classified as a Class B Part II controlled drug in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975, making it illegal to supply or possess except on prescription.<ref>{{cite web|title=Controlled drugs|url=http://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/regulation-health-and-disability-system/medicines-control/controlled-drugs|website=www.health.govt.nz|accessdate=6 July 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Misuse of Drugs Act 1975 No 116, Public Act 8 Exemptions from sections 6 and 7|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1975/0116/latest/DLM436242.html|website=www.legislation.govt.nz|accessdate=6 July 2017|language=en-NZ|date=22 December 2016}}</ref>.

Pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and any product containing these substances, e.g. cold and flu medicines, were first classified in October 2004 as Class C Part III (partially exempted) controlled drugs, due to being the principal ingredient in methamphetamine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/regulatory/Guideline/ephedrineAndPseudoephedrine.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308163452/http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/regulatory/Guideline/ephedrineAndPseudoephedrine.asp |archivedate=2007-03-08 |title=Ephedrine and Pseudoephedrine to Become Controlled Drugs |publisher=Medsafe, New Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority}}</ref> New Zealand Customs and police officers continued to make large interceptions of precursor substances believed to be destined for [[methamphetamine]] production.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, pseudoephedrine is available over the counter under the supervision of a qualified pharmacist, or on prescription. In 2007, the [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency|MHRA]] reacted to concerns over diversion of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine for the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine by introducing voluntary restrictions limiting over the counter sales to one box containing no more than 720&nbsp;mg of pseudoephedrine in total per transaction. These restrictions became law in April 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&dDocName=CON014095&RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased |title=Drug Safety Update, March 2008 |format=PDF |work= |date=2008-06-30 |publisher=The [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] and the [[Commission on Human Medicines]]}}</ref> However no form of ID is required.

===United States===
====Federal====
The [[United States Congress]] has recognized that pseudoephedrine is used in the illegal manufacture of methamphetamine. In 2005, the [[United States House Committee on Education and Labor|Committee on Education and the Workforce]] heard testimony concerning education programs and state legislation designed to curb this illegal practice.

Attempts to control the sale of the drug date back to 1986, when federal officials at the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) first drafted legislation, later proposed by Senator [[Bob Dole]], R-KS, that would have placed a number of chemicals used in the manufacture of illicit drugs under the [[Controlled Substances Act]]. The bill would have required each transaction involving pseudoephedrine to be reported to the government, and federal approval of all imports and exports. Fearing this would limit legitimate use of the drug, lobbyists from over the counter drug manufacturing associations sought to stop this legislation from moving forward, and were successful in exempting from the regulations all chemicals that had been turned into a legal final product, such as Sudafed.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.oregonlive.com/special/oregonian/meth/stories/index.ssf?/oregonian/meth/1004_lobbyistsandloopholes.html | work=The Oregonian | title=Search OregonLive.com}}</ref>

Prior to the passage of the [[Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005]], sales of the drug became increasingly regulated, as DEA regulators and pharmaceutical companies continued to fight for their respective positions. The DEA continued to make greater progress in their attempts to control pseudoephedrine as methamphetamine production skyrocketed, becoming a serious problem in the western United States. When purity dropped, so did the number of people in rehab and people admitted to emergency rooms with methamphetamine in their systems. However, this reduction in purity was usually short lived, as methamphetamine producers eventually found a way around the new regulations.<ref>{{cite news|title=How Legislation Changed Meth Purity |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/special/oregonian/meth/pdfs/1004meth_purity.pdf |format=PDF |work=The Oregonian}}</ref>

Congress passed the ''[[Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005]]'' ("CMEA") as an amendment to the renewal of the [[Patriot Act|USA PATRIOT Act]]. Signed into law by president [[George W. Bush]] on March 6, 2006, the act amended {{United States Code|21|830}}, concerning the sale of pseudoephedrine-containing products. The law mandated two phases, the first needing to be implemented by April 8, 2006, and the second to be completed by September 30, 2006. The first phase dealt primarily with implementing the new buying restrictions based on amount, while the second phase encompassed the requirements of storage, employee training, and record keeping.<ref name="papharmacists.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.papharmacists.com/APhA%20Summary%20of%20Combat%20Meth%20Interim%20Final%20Rule.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018011450/http://www.papharmacists.com/APhA%20Summary%20of%20Combat%20Meth%20Interim%20Final%20Rule.pdf |archivedate=2006-10-18 |format=PDF |title=DEA Interim Final Regulation: Ephedrine, Pseudoephedrine, and Phenylpropanolamine Requirements}}</ref> Though the law was mainly directed at pseudoephedrine products it also applies to all over-the-counter products containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine, their salts, optical isomers,
and salts of optical isomers.<ref name="papharmacists.com"/>
Pseudoephedrine was defined as a "[[DEA list of chemicals|scheduled listed chemical product]]" under {{United States Code|21|802}}(45(A)). The act included the following requirements for merchants ("regulated sellers") who sell such products:

*Required a retrievable record of all purchases, identifying the name and address of each party, to be kept for two years
*Required verification of proof of identity of all purchasers
*Required protection and disclosure methods in the collection of personal information
*Required reports to the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] of any suspicious payments or disappearances of the regulated products
*Required training of employees with regard to the requirements of the CMEA. Retailers must self-certify as to training and compliance.
*The non-liquid dose form of regulated products may only be sold in unit dose blister packs
*Regulated products must be stored behind the counter or in a locked cabinet in such a way as to restrict public access
*Sales limits (per customer):
**Daily sales limit—must not exceed 3.6&nbsp;grams of pseudoephedrine base without regard to the number of transactions
**30-day (not monthly) sales limit—must not exceed 7.5&nbsp;grams of pseudoephedrine base if sold by mail order or "mobile retail vendor"
**30-day purchase limit—must not exceed 9&nbsp;grams of pseudoephedrine base. (A misdemeanor possession offense under {{UnitedStatesCode|21|844a}} for the person who buys it.)

In regards to the identification that may be used by an individual buying pseudoephedrine products the following constitute acceptable forms of identification:
*US passport
*Alien registration or permanent resident card
*Unexpired foreign passport with temporary I-551 stamp
*Unexpired Employment Authorization Document
*Driver's License or Government issued identification card (including Canadian driver's license)
*School ID with picture
*Voter's Registration card
*US Military Card
*Native American tribal documents<ref name="papharmacists.com"/>

Additionally, similar decreases in meth lab incidents were seen in surrounding states, according to the report, and meth-related deaths in Oregon have dramatically risen since 2007.  Some municipalities in Missouri have enacted similar ordinances, including Washington,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.emissourian.com/news/washington_news/article_6aec84e6-f67e-5535-a4d9-9d8be4452a22.html|title=Council Passes Law Restricting Pseudoephedrine |publisher=[[The Washington Missourian]]|date=July 7, 2009|accessdate=December 10, 2010}}</ref> Union,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.emissourian.com/news/washington_news/article_6aec84e6-f67e-5535-a4d9-9d8be4452a22.html|title=Union Board Approves Pseudoephedrine Ordinance |publisher=[[The Washington Missourian]]|date=October 13, 2009|accessdate=December 10, 2010}}</ref> New Haven,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.emissourian.com/news/top_stories/article_776823c6-ee98-11df-b2bd-001cc4c03286.html|title=New Haven Passes Prescription Law |publisher=[[The Washington Missourian]]|date=November 11, 2010|accessdate=December 10, 2010}}</ref> Cape Girardeau<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.semissourian.com/story/1685849.html|title=Cape Girardeau City Council passes prescription requirement for pseudoephedrine |publisher=[[The Southeast Missourian]]|date=December 7, 2010|accessdate=December 10, 2010}}</ref> and Ozark.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://ccheadliner.com/news/ozark-passes-pseudoephedrine-ban/article_4d163742-d83e-11e2-9158-0019bb2963f4.html |subscription=yes |newspaper=CCHeadliner.com |title=Ozark passes pseudoephedrine ban: Drug now prescription-only |date=June 18, 2013 |accessdate=December 17, 2013}}</ref> Certain pharmacies in Terre Haute, Indiana do so as well.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tribstar.com/news/x1414109043/Four-Valley-pharmacies-to-require-prescriptions-for-certain-products-to-help-fight-meth-problem |title=Four Valley pharmacies to require prescriptions for certain products to help fight meth problem |work=Terre Haute Tribune-Star |last=Trigg |first=Lisa |date=May 20, 2010}} {{link note|note=Subscription required, free access for first 30 days}}</ref>

Another approach to controlling the drug on the state level which has been mandated by some state governments to control the purchases of their citizens is the use of electronic tracking systems, which require the electronic submission of specified purchaser information by all retailers who sell pseudoephedrine. 32 states now require the National Precursor Log Exchange (NPLEx) to be used for every pseudoephedrine and ephedrine OTC purchase, and ten of the eleven largest pharmacy chains in the US voluntarily contribute all of their similar transactions to NPLEx. These states have seen dramatic results in reducing the number of methamphetamine laboratory seizures. Prior to implementation of the system in Tennessee in 2005, methamphetamine laboratory seizures totaled 1,497 in 2004, but were reduced to 955 in 2005, and 589 in 2009.<ref name="justice.gov"/> Kentucky's program was implemented statewide in 2008, and since statewide implementation, the number of laboratory seizures has significantly decreased.<ref name="justice.gov"/> Oklahoma initially experienced success with their tracking system after implementation in 2006, as the number of seizures dropped in that year and again in 2007. However, in 2008, seizures began rising again, and have continued to rise in 2009.<ref name="justice.gov"/>  However, when Oklahoma adopted NPLEx, their lab seizures also dropped significantly.

NPLEx appears to be successful by requiring the real-time submission of transactions, thereby enabling the relevant laws to be enforced at the point of sale.  By creating a multi-state database and the ability to compare all transactions quickly, NPLEx enables pharmacies to deny purchases that would be illegal based on gram limits, age, or even to convicted meth offenders in some states.  NPLEx also enforces the federal gram limits across state lines, which was impossible with state-operated systems.  Access to the records is by law enforcement agencies only, through an online secure portal.<ref>{{Cite web|title = NPLEx - National Precursor Log Exchange|url = http://www.nplexservice.com/|website = www.nplexservice.com|accessdate = 2015-10-24}}</ref>
