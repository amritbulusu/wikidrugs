'''Betahistine''' (brand names '''Veserc''', '''Serc''', '''Hiserk''', '''Betaserc''', '''Vergo''') is an anti-[[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]] drug. It is commonly prescribed for [[balance disorder]]s or to alleviate vertigo symptoms associated with [[Ménière's disease]]. It was first registered in Europe in 1970 for the treatment of [[Ménière's disease]].

==Contraindications==
Betahistine is contraindicated for people with [[pheochromocytoma]]. People with [[bronchial asthma]] and history of peptic ulcer need to be closely monitored.

==Side effects==
Patients taking betahistine dihydrochloride may experience following side effects:<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sokolova L, Hoerr R, Mishchenko T | year = 2014 | title = Treatment of Vertigo: A Randomized, Double-Blind Trial Comparing Efficacy and Safety of Ginkgo biloba Extract EGb 761 and Betahistine | url = | journal = Int J Otolaryngol | volume = 2014 | issue = | page = 682439 | doi = 10.1155/2014/682439 | pmid = 25057270 | pmc=4099171}}</ref>

* Headache
* Low level of gastric side effects
* Nausea can be a side effect, but the patient is generally already experiencing nausea due to the vertigo so it goes largely unnoticed.
* Patients taking betahistine dihydrochloride may experience several hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. In the November 2006 issue of "Drug Safety," Dr. Sabine Jeck-Thole and Dr. Wolfgang Wagner reported that betahistine dihydrochloride may cause several allergic and skin-related side effects. These include rash in several areas of the body; itching and hives; and swelling of the face, tongue and mouth. Other hypersensitivity reactions reported include tingling, numbness, burning sensations, shortness of breath and laboured breathing. The study authors suggest that hypersensitivity reactions may be a direct result of betahistine's role in increasing histamine levels throughout the body. Hypersensitivity reactions quickly subside after betahistine has been discontinued.

===Digestive===
Betahistine may also cause several digestive-related side effects. The package insert for Serc, a trade name for betahistine, states that patients may experience several gastrointestinal side effects. These may include nausea, upset stomach, vomiting, diarrhea and stomach cramping. These symptoms are usually not serious and subside between doses. Patients experiencing chronic digestive problems may lower their dose to the minimum effective range and by taking betahistine with meals. Additional digestive problems may require that patients consult their physician in order to find a possible suitable alternative.

===Others===
People taking betahistine may experience several other side effects ranging from mild to serious. The package insert for Serc states that patients may experience nervous-system side effects, including headache. Some nervous system events may also partly be attributable to the underlying condition rather than the medication used to treat it. The study by Jeck-Thole and Wagner also reports that patients may experience headache and liver problems, including increased liver enzymes and bile-flow disturbances. Any side effects that persist or outweigh the relief of symptoms of the original condition may warrant that the patient consult their physician to adjust or change the medication.

==Pharmacology==
Betahistine has a very strong affinity as an antagonist for histamine [[histamine H3 receptor|H<sub>3</sub> receptors]] and a weak affinity as an agonist for histamine [[histamine H1 receptor|H<sub>1</sub> receptors]].{{cn|date=September 2016}}

Betahistine has two mechanisms of action. Primarily, it a full agonist on the H<sub>1</sub> receptors located on blood vessels in the inner ear. This gives rise to local vasodilation and increased permeability, which helps to reverse the underlying problem of endolymphatic hydrops.

More importantly, betahistine has a powerful antagonistic effects at H<sub>3</sub> receptors, thereby increasing the levels of neurotransmitters [[histamine]], [[acetylcholine]], [[norepinephrine]], [[serotonin]], and [[GABA]] released from the nerve endings. The increased amounts of histamine released from histaminergic nerve endings can stimulate receptors. This stimulation explains the potent vasodilatory effects of betahistine in the inner ear, that are well documented.

Betahistine seems to dilate the blood vessels within the inner ear which can relieve pressure from excess fluid and act on the smooth muscle.

It is postulated that betahistine's increase in the level of [[serotonin]] in the brainstem inhibits the activity of [[vestibular nuclei]].

==Pharmacokinetics==
Betahistine comes in both a tablet form as well as an oral solution, and is taken orally. It is rapidly and completely absorbed. The mean plasma [[half-life]] is 3–4 hours, and excretion is virtually complete in the [[urine]] within 24 hours. [[Plasma protein]] binding is very low. Betahistine is transformed into aminoethylpyridine and hydroxyethylpyridine and excreted with the urine as [[pyridylacetic acid]]. There is some evidence that one of these metabolites, aminoethylpyridine, may be active and exert effects similar to those of betahistine on ampullar receptors.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Botta L, Mira E, Valli S, Zucca G, Perin P, Benvenuti C, Fossati A, Valli P | title = Effects of betahistine and of its metabolites on vestibular sensory organs.| journal = Acta Otorhinolaryngol Ital. | volume = 21 | issue = 3 Suppl 66 | pages = 24–30 |date=June 2001 | pmid = 11677836}}</ref>

==Chemistry==
Betahistine chemically is 2-[2-(methylamino)ethyl]pyridine, and is formulated as the [[dihydrochloride]] [[salt]]. Its structure closely resembles that of [[phenethylamine]] and [[histamine]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}
