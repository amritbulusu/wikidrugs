== Medical uses ==

=== Chemotherapy adjuvant ===

Mesna is used therapeutically to reduce the incidence of [[hemorrhagic cystitis|haemorrhagic cystitis]] and [[hematuria|haematuria]] when a patient receives ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide for cancer chemotherapy. These two anticancer agents, ''in vivo'', may be converted to urotoxic metabolites, such as [[acrolein]].

Mesna assists to detoxify these metabolites by reaction of its [[sulfhydryl]] group with [[carbonyl#.CE.B1.2C.CE.B2-Unsaturated carbonyl compounds|α,β-unsaturated carbonyl]] containing compounds such as acrolein.<ref name = "Thurston_2007">{{cite book | last1 = Thurston | first1 = David E. | name-list-format = vanc | title = Chemistry and Pharmacology of Anticancer Drugs | date = 2007 | publisher = CRC Press/Taylor & Francis | location = Boca Raton | isbn = 978-1-4200-0890-6 | pages = 53–54 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5uB19xhhyDsC&lpg=PA54&ots=aozQs_9oDY&dq=ifosfamide%20mesna%20michael%20addition%20detoxification&pg=PA54#v=onepage&q=ifosfamide%20mesna%20michael%20addition%20detoxification&f=false}}</ref> This reaction is known as a [[Michael addition]].  Mesna also increases urinary excretion of [[cysteine]].

=== Other ===

Outside North America, mesna is also used as a [[mucolytic agent]], working in the same way as [[acetylcysteine]]; it is sold for this indication as Mistabron<ref>{{cite web |url=http://home.intekom.com/pharm/ucb/mistabrn.html |title=Mistabron Ampoules |date=August 1973 |publisher=South African Electronic Package Inserts |accessdate=2008-08-12}}</ref> and Mistabronco.

== Administration ==

It is administered [[intravenously]] or orally (per mouth).<ref name="pmid14676103">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Mace JR, Keohan ML, Bernardy H, etal |title=Crossover randomized comparison of intravenous versus intravenous/oral mesna in soft tissue sarcoma treated with high-dose ifosfamide |journal=Clin. Cancer Res. |volume=9 |issue=16 Pt 1 |pages=5829–34 |date=December 2003 |pmid=14676103 |doi= |url=http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14676103}}</ref> The IV mesna infusions would be given with IV ifosfamide, while oral mesna would be given with oral cyclophosphamide. The oral doses must be double the intravenous (IV) mesna dose due to bioavailability issues. The oral preparation allows patients to leave the hospital sooner, instead of staying four to five days for all the IV mesna infusions.

== Mechanism ==

Mesna reduces the toxicity of urotoxic compounds that may form after chemotherapy administration.  Mesna is a water-soluble compound with antioxidant properties, and is given concomitantly with the chemotherapeutic agents [[cyclophosphamide]] and [[ifosfamide]].  Mesna concentrates in the bladder where [[acrolein]] accumulates after administration of chemotherapy and through a [[Michael addition]], forms a conjugate with [[acrolein]] and other urotoxic metabolites.<ref name = "Thurston_2007"/>  This conjugation reaction inactivates the urotoxic compounds to harmless metabolites.  The metabolites are then excreted in the urine.<ref name="pmid3119211">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shaw IC, Graham MI | title = Mesna—a short review | journal = Cancer Treat. Rev. | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 67–86 | year = 1987 | pmid = 3119211 | doi = 10.1016/0305-7372(87)90041-7 }}</ref>

==Names==
It is marketed by [[Baxter International|Baxter]] as Uromitexan and Mesnex. The name of the substance is an acronym for 2-'''m'''ercapto'''e'''thane '''s'''ulfonate '''Na''' (''Na'' being the chemical symbol for [[sodium]]).
