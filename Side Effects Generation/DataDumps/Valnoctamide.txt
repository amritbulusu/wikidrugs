'''Valnoctamide''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[United States Approved Name|USAN]]) has been used in France as a [[sedative]]-[[hypnotic]] since 1964.<ref name="Harl_1964">{{cite journal | first = F.

==Indications==
In addition to being a sedative, valnoctamide has been investigated for use in [[epilepsy]].<ref name=Mattos_Nda_1969>{{cite journal | first = S. | last = Mattos Nda |date=May 1969| language = Portuguese | title = [Use of Valnoctamide (nirvanil) in oligophrenic erethics and epileptics] | journal = Hospital (Rio J) | volume = 75 | issue = 5 | pages = 1701–1704 | pmid = 5306499}}</ref><ref name=Lindekens_et_al_2000>{{cite journal | first = H. | last = Lindekens |author2=Ilse Smolders |author3=Ghous M.

It was studied for [[neuropathic pain]] in 2005 by Winkler et al., with good results: it had minimal effects on [[motor coordination]] and alertness at effective doses, and appeared to be equally effective as [[gabapentin]].<ref name=pain>{{cite journal | first = Ilan | last = Winkler |author2=Simcha Blotnik |author3=Jakob Shimshoni |author4=Boris Yagen |author5=Marshall Devor |author6=Meir Bialer  |date=September 2005 | title = Efficacy of antiepileptic isomers of valproic acid and valpromide in a rat model of neuropathic pain | journal = [[British Journal of Pharmacology]] | pmid = 15997234 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bjp.0706310 | volume = 146 | pages = 198–208 | issue = 2 | pmc = 1576263}}</ref>

RH Belmaker, Yuly Bersudsky and Alex Mishory started a clinical trial of valnoctamide for [[prophylaxis]] of [[mania]] in lieu of the much more teratogenic valproic acid or its salts.<ref name=kinder_gentler_valproate>{{cite web |author1=RH Belmaker |author2=Yuly Bersudsky |author3=Alex Mishory |author4=Beersheva Mental Health Center | year = 2005 | title = Valnoctamide in Mania | url = http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/gui/show/NCT00140179?order=213 | work = ClinicalTrials.gov | publisher = United States National Institutes of Health | accessdate = 25 February 2006}}</ref>

==Side effects==
The [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]]s of valnoctamide are mostly minor and include [[somnolence]] and the slight motor impairments mentioned above.<!--Those were really the only two I could find-->

==Interactions==
Valnoctamide is known to increase through inhibition of [[epoxide]] [[hydrolase]] the serum levels of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, the [[metabolite|active metabolite]] of [[carbamazepine]], sometimes to toxic levels.<ref name=carbamazepine>{{cite journal | last1 = Pisani | first1 = F | last2 = Fazio | first2 = A | last3 = Artesi | first3 = C | last4 = Oteri | first4 = G | last5 = Spina | first5 = E | last6 = Tomson | first6 = T | last7 = Perucca | first7 = E | title = Impairment of carbamazepine-10, 11-epoxide elimination by valnoctamide, a valpromide isomer, in healthy subjects | journal = British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 85–87 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1352988 | pmc = 1381382 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.1992.tb04114.x}}</ref>

==Chemistry==
