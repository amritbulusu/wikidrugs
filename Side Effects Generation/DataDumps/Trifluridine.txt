'''Trifluridine''' (also called '''trifluorothymidine''' or '''TFT''') is an anti-[[herpesvirus]] [[antiviral drug]], used primarily on the [[human eye|eye]]. It was sold under the trade name '''Viroptic''' by Glaxo Wellcome, now merged into [[GlaxoSmithKline]]. The brand is now owned by [[Monarch Pharmaceuticals]], which is wholly owned by [[King Pharmaceuticals]].

Trifluridine was approved for medical use in 1980.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Long|first1=Sarah S.|last2=Pickering|first2=Larry K.|last3=Prober|first3=Charles G.|title=Principles and Practice of Pediatric Infectious Disease|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=1437727026|page=1502|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=nQ7-o8JAH7kC&pg=PA1502|language=en}}</ref> It is also a component of the anti-cancer drug [[trifluridine/tipiracil]], which is taken by mouth.

==Medical uses==
Trifluridine eye drops are used for the treatment of [[keratitis]] and [[keratoconjunctivitis]] caused by the [[herpes simplex virus]] types 1 and 2, as well as for prevention and treatment of [[vaccinia virus]] infections of the eye.<ref name="Drugs.com" />

A [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane Systematic Review]] showed that trifluridine and [[aciclovir]] were a more effective treatment than [[idoxuridine]] or [[vidarabine]],<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.cochrane.org/CD002898/EYES_antiviral-medicines-interferon-and-corneal-surface-removal-in-the-treatment-of-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-of-the-eye|title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|last=Wilhelmus|first=Kirk R|date=2015-01-09|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd002898.pub5|issn=1465-1858}}</ref> significantly increasing the relative number of successfully healed eyes in 14 days.<ref name="Wilhelmus">{{cite journal |author= Wilhelmus KR |title= Antiviral treatment and other therapeutic interventions for herpes simplex virus epithelial keratitis |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume=12 |pages= CD002898 |date=2010 |pmid= 21154352|doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD002898.pub4 |pmc=4739528}}</ref>

For cancer treatment, the combination [[trifluridine/tipiracil]] is used.

==Adverse effects==
Common side effects of trifluridine eye drops include transient burning, stinging, local irritation, and [[edema]] of the eyelids.<ref name="Drugs.com" />

Adverse effects of the anti-cancer formulation have only been evaluated for the combination trifluridine/tipiracil, not for the individual components.

==Interactions==
Only ''[[in vitro]]'' interaction studies are available. In these, trifluridine used the [[concentrative nucleoside transporter 1]] (CNT1) and [[equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1|equilibrative nucleoside transporters 1]] (ENT1) and [[equilibrative nucleoside transporter 2|2]] (ENT2). Drugs that interact with these transporters could influence [[blood plasma]] concentrations of trifluridine. Being a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor, trifluridine could also interact with substrates of this enzyme such as [[zidovudine]].<ref name="AC">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2015|language=German}}</ref>

For the eye drops, trifluridine absorption is negligible,<ref name="Drugs.com">[[Drugs.com]]: {{drugs.com|monograph|trifluridine}} for Trifluridine.</ref> rendering interactions basically irrelevant.

==Pharmacology==
{{for|the anti-cancer mechanism|Trifluridine/tipiracil#Mechanism of action}}

===Mechanism of action (eye drops)===
It is a [[nucleoside analogue]], a modified form of [[deoxyuridine]], similar enough to be incorporated into viral [[DNA replication]], but the –CF<sub>3</sub> group added to the [[uracil]] component blocks [[base pair]]ing, thus interfering with viral DNA replication.

===Pharmacokinetics (eye drops)===
Trifluridine passes the [[cornea]] and is found in the [[aqueous humour]]. Systemic absorption is negligible.<ref name="Drugs.com" />

===Pharmacokinetics (oral)===
[[File:Trifluoromethyl-pyrimidinedione.svg|thumb|5-Trifluoromethyl-2,4(1''H'',3''H'')-pyrimidinedione (FTY), the main metabolite]]
Pharmacokinetic data of oral trifluridine have only been evaluated in combination with [[tipiracil]], which significantly affects [[biotransformation]] of the former. At least 57% of trifluridine are absorbed from the gut, and highest blood plasma concentrations are reached after two hours in cancer patients. The substance has no tendency to [[bioaccumulation|accumulate]] in the body. Plasma protein binding is over 96%. Trifluridine is metabolised by the enzyme [[thymidine phosphorylase]] to 5-trifluoromethyl-2,4(1''H'',3''H'')-pyrimidinedione (FTY), and also by [[glucuronidation]]. Elimination half-life is 1.4 hours on the first day and increases to 2.1 hours on the twelfth day. It is mainly excreted via the kidneys.<ref name="AC" />

Tipiracil causes [[Cmax (pharmacology)|C<sub>max</sub>]] (highest blood plasma concentrations) of trifluridine to increase 22-fold, and its [[area under the curve (pharmacokinetics)|area under the curve]] 37-fold, by inhibiting thymidine phosphorylase.<ref name="AC" />

==Chemistry==
The substance is a white crystalline powder. It is freely soluble in [[methanol]] and [[acetone]]; soluble in water, [[ethanol]], 0.01&nbsp;[[molarity|M]] hydrochloric acid, and 0.01&nbsp;M sodium hydroxide; sparingly soluble in [[isopropyl alcohol]] and [[acetonitrile]]; slightly soluble in [[diethyl ether]]; and very slightly soluble in [[isopropyl ether]].<ref>{{Drugs.com|pro|lonsurf}} on Lonsurf.</ref>
