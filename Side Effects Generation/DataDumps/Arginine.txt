==Sources==

===Dietary sources===
A conditionally essential amino acid is one that may be required depending on the health status or life cycle of the individual. Arginine is one such conditionally essential amino acid. Endogenous synthesis may suffice, if not that, then synthesis plus absorption from protein-containing foods is enough. In rare instances a healthcare professional may recommend an arginine dietary supplement. 
Almost all dietary protein contains arginine (exception: gelatin):
* Animal sources: Meat, fish, fowl, eggs, dairy
* Plant sources: Grains, beans, corn, nuts; not fruits, vegetables or leafy greens

===Biosynthesis===
Arginine is synthesized from [[citrulline]] in [[arginine and proline metabolism]] by the sequential action of the cytosolic enzymes [[argininosuccinate synthetase]] (ASS) and [[argininosuccinate lyase]] (ASL). In terms of energy, this is costly, as the synthesis of each molecule of argininosuccinate requires hydrolysis of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) to [[adenosine monophosphate]] (AMP), i.e., two ATP equivalents. In essence, taking an excess of arginine gives more energy by saving ATPs that can be used elsewhere.

Citrulline can be derived from multiple sources:
* from arginine via [[nitric oxide synthase]] (NOS)
* from [[ornithine]] via catabolism of [[proline]] or [[glutamine]]/[[glutamate]]
* from [[asymmetric dimethylarginine]] (ADMA) via DDAH

The pathways linking arginine, [[glutamine]], and [[proline]] are bidirectional. Thus, the net utilization or production of these amino acids is highly dependent on cell type and developmental stage.

On a whole-body basis, synthesis of arginine occurs principally via the intestinal–renal axis, wherein [[epithelial cell]]s of the [[small intestine]], which produce [[citrulline]] primarily from [[glutamine]] and [[glutamate]], collaborate with the [[proximal tubule cell]]s of the [[kidney]], which extract citrulline from the circulation and convert it to arginine, which is returned to the circulation. As a consequence, impairment of small bowel or renal function can reduce endogenous arginine synthesis, thereby increasing the dietary requirement.

Synthesis of arginine from citrulline also occurs at a low level in many other cells, and cellular capacity for arginine synthesis can be markedly increased under circumstances that also induce [[Nitric oxide synthase|iNOS]]. Thus, citrulline, a coproduct of the NOS-catalyzed reaction, can be recycled to arginine in a pathway known as the citrulline-NO or arginine-citrulline pathway. This is demonstrated by the fact that, in many cell types, citrulline can substitute for arginine to some degree in supporting NO synthesis. However, recycling is not quantitative because citrulline accumulates along with nitrate and nitrite, the stable end-products of NO, in NO-producing cells.<ref name="pmid15465778">{{cite journal | author = Morris SM | title = Enzymes of arginine metabolism | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 134 | issue = 10 Suppl | pages = 2743S–2747S; discussion 2765S–2767S  | date = Oct 2004 | pmid = 15465778 | doi = | department = (review) }}</ref>

===Proteins===
The distributing basics of the moderate structure found in geometry, charge distribution, and ability to form multiple H-bonds make arginine ideal for binding negatively charged groups. For this reason, arginine prefers to be on the outside of the proteins, where it can interact with the polar environment.

Incorporated in proteins, arginine can also be converted to citrulline by PAD enzymes. In addition, arginine can be [[Methylation|methylated]] by protein methyltransferases.

===Precursor===
Arginine is the immediate precursor of [[nitric oxide]] (NO), [[urea]], [[ornithine]], and [[agmatine]]; is necessary for the synthesis of [[creatine]]; and can also be used for the synthesis of [[polyamine]]s (mainly through ornithine and to a lesser degree through agmatine), [[citrulline]], and [[glutamate]]. As a precursor of nitric oxide, arginine may have a role in the treatment of some conditions where [[vasodilation]] is required.<ref name="tapiero"/> The presence of [[asymmetric dimethylarginine]] (ADMA), a close relative, inhibits the nitric oxide reaction; therefore, ADMA is considered a marker for [[vascular disease]], just as <small>L</small>-arginine is considered a sign of a healthy [[endothelium]].

===Safety===
L-arginine is generally recognized as safe (GRAS-status) at intakes of up to 20 grams per day.<ref name="Shao2008">{{cite journal |vauthors=Shao A, Hathcock JN | year = 2008 | title = Risk assessment for the amino acids taurine, L-glutamine and L-arginine | url = | journal = Regul Toxicol Pharmacol | volume = 50 | issue = 3| pages = 376–399 | doi = 10.1016/j.yrtph.2008.01.004 | pmid=18325648}}</ref>

==Structure==
[[File:Betaine Arginine.png|thumb|right|250px|Delocalization of charge in guanidinium group of L-Arginine]]
The [[amino acid]] [[Substituent|side-chain]] of arginine consists of a 3-carbon [[aliphatic]] straight chain, the distal end of which is capped by a complex [[guanidine|guanidinium]] group.

With a [[Acid dissociation constant|p''K''<sub>a</sub>]] of 12.48, the guanidinium group will accept a positive charge in neutral, acidic, and even most basic environments, and thus imparts [[Basic (chemistry)|basic]] chemical properties to arginine.
Because of the [[Conjugated system|conjugation]] between the double bond and the nitrogen lone pairs, the positive charge is delocalized, enabling the formation of multiple [[Hydrogen bond|H-bonds]].

==Research==
===Growth hormone===
Intravenously-administered arginine stimulates the secretion of [[growth hormone]],<ref name="alba-roth">{{cite journal |vauthors=Alba-Roth J, Müller OA, Schopohl J, von Werder K | title = Arginine stimulates growth hormone secretion by suppressing endogenous somatostatin secretion | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 67 | issue = 6 | pages = 1186–9  | date = Dec 1988 | pmid = 2903866 | doi = 10.1210/jcem-67-6-1186 }}</ref> and for this reason is used in growth hormone stimulation tests.<ref>U.S. National Library of Medicine (September 2009 [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003377.htm Growth hormone stimulation test]</ref>

Several trials delved into effects of <small>L</small>-arginine in [[Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes|Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS syndrome)]], an inherited [[mitochondrial disease]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=El-Hattab AW, Almannai M, Scaglia F |title=Arginine and citrulline for the treatment of MELAS syndrome |journal=J Inborn Errors Metab Screen |volume=5 |issue= |pages= |year=2017 |pmid=28736735 |pmc=5519148 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

===High blood pressure===

===Hypersensitive teeth===
A 2016 review of clinical trials of toothpastes marketed to help people with [[Dentin hypersensitivity|sensitive teeth]] and meta-analysis found that clinical trials were generally of poor quality, but based on the data at hand arginine-containing toothpastes appeared to be as effective in the long term as the other toothpastes tested.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yang ZY, Wang F, Lu K, Li YH, Zhou Z |title=Arginine-containing desensitizing toothpaste for the treatment of dentin hypersensitivity: a meta-analysis |journal=Clin Cosmet Investig Dent |volume=8 |issue= |pages=1–14 |year=2016 |pmid=26793006 |pmc=4708190 |doi=10.2147/CCIDE.S95660 |url=}}</ref>
