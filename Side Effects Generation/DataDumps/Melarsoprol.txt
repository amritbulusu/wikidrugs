==Medical uses==
People diagnosed with trypanosome-caused disease should be treated with an anti-trypanosomal. Treatment is based on stage, 1 or 2, and parasite,''T. b. rhodesiense'' or ''T. b. gambiense''. In stage 1 disease, trypanosomes are present only in the peripheral circulation. In stage 2 disease, trypanosomes have crossed the blood brain barrier and are present in the central nervous system.<ref name="CDC2013" />

The following are considerable treatment options:<ref name="CDC2013">{{cite journal |author=CDC |title=Disease Control and Prevention: Parasites Africian Trypanosomiasis |year=2013 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/sleepingsickness/health_professionals/index.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619152551/https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/sleepingsickness/health_professionals/index.html |archivedate=2017-06-19 |df= }}</ref>

Melarsoprol is a treatment used during the second stage of the disease. So far, it is the only treatment available for late-stage ''T. b. rhodesiense''.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.antimicrobe.org/b54.asp|title=Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (African Trypanosomiasis) - Infectious Disease and Antimicrobial Agents|website=www.antimicrobe.org|access-date=2016-11-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128184244/http://www.antimicrobe.org/b54.asp|archivedate=2016-11-28|df=}}</ref>

Due to high toxicity, melarsoprol is reserved only for the most dangerous cases.

==Side effects==
Although melarsoprol cures about 96% of people with late stage disease, its toxicity limits its use.<ref name=":1" /> About 1-5% of people die from adverse events related to melarsoprol treatment.<ref name=":0" /> As a toxic organic compound of [[arsenic]], melarsoprol is a dangerous treatment that is typically only administered by injection under the supervision of a licensed physician. Notable side effects are similar to arsenic poisoning. Among clinicians, it is colloquially referred to as "arsenic in antifreeze".<ref name="Ref 10">{{cite journal | author = Hollingham R | title = Curing diseases modern medicine has left behind | journal = New Scientist | year = 2005 | volume = 2005 | issue = 2482 | pages = 40–41 | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18524821.800-curing-diseases-modern-medicine-has-left-behind.html | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150511085448/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18524821.800-curing-diseases-modern-medicine-has-left-behind.html | archivedate = 2015-05-11 | df =  }}</ref> Severe and life-threatening adverse reactions are associated with melarsoprol. It is known to cause a range of side effects including convulsions, fever, loss of consciousness, rashes, bloody stools, nausea and vomiting. In approximately 5-10% of cases, it causes [[encephalopathy]]. Of those, about 50% die due to encephalopathy-related adverse reactions.<ref name=CDC2013/> Additional potentially serious side effects of melarsoprol include damage to the heart, presence of albumin in the urine that could be associated with kidney damage, and an increase in blood pressure.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Jh2922e/2.10.3.html#Jh2922e.2.10.3|title=WHO Model Prescribing Information: Drugs Used in Parasitic Diseases - Second Edition: Protozoa: African trypanosomiasis: Melarsoprol|website=apps.who.int|access-date=2016-11-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110044003/http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Jh2922e/2.10.3.html#Jh2922e.2.10.3|archivedate=2016-11-10|df=}}</ref>

===Cautions===
Numerous warnings must be examined before melarsoprol treatment can be initiated. Prior to initiation, the following must be noted: [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]], kidney or liver disease, cardiac problems (high blood pressure, irregular beating of the heart or [[Cardiac arrhythmia|arrhythmias,]] any damage to the heart muscles and potential signs of [[heart failure]]), preexisting nervous system disorders, and any signs of leprosy.

Routine laboratory testing is needed before and after melarsoprol initiation. Laboratory parameters for both therapeutic effects and toxic effects need to be evaluated.

Blood analysis is used to detect the presence of trypanosomes. An evaluation of the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] via a [[lumbar puncture]] is also used to determine an individual's white blood count and level of protein. These are diagnostic criteria such that the presence of trypanosomes, an elevated white blood count greater than five per microliter, or a protein content greater than 40&nbsp;mg are considered abnormal and initiation should be considered. Continuous cerebrospinal fluid evaluation should be repeated every six months for at least three years in individuals that have undergone melarsoprol treatment.

To assess potential concerns related to toxicity, the following should be completed: a complete blood count, an assessment of [[electrolyte]] levels, liver and kidney function tests, and a [[Clinical urine tests|urinalysis]] to detect the appearance, concentration and content of the urine.

===Pregnancy and breastfeeding===
Currently, melarsoprol is not recommended for use in pregnant women. The World Health Organization suggests that treatment be deferred until immediately after delivery since the effects of the medication on the developing fetus have not yet been established.<ref name=":0" />

Lactation guidelines associated with melarsoprol have not yet been established.

==Mechanism of action==
Melarsoprol is a prodrug, which is metabolized to melarsen oxide (Mel Ox) as its active form. Mel Ox is an arsen-oxide that irreversibly binds to vicinal [[sulfhydryl]] groups on [[pyruvate kinase]], which disrupts energy production in the parasite. The inability to distinguish between host and parasites renders this drug highly toxic with many side effects.

Mel Ox reacts with [[trypanothione]] (a spermidine-glutathione adduct that replaces glutathione in trypanosomes). By binding to this adduct, it forms a melarsen oxide-trypanothione adduct (Mel T) that competitively inhibits trypanothione reductase, effectively killing the parasitic cell.<ref name="“Ref 3"/>

==Dosage==
Two arsenic-containing [[stereoisomers]] exist in a 3:1 molar ratio. Since melarsarprol is insoluble in water, dosage occurs via a 3.6% [[propylene glycol]] intravenous injection.<ref name="“Ref 3"/> To avoid the risk of injection site reactions, melarsoprol must be given slowly.

Melarsoprol used for the treatment of African trypanosomiasis with CNS involvement is given under a complicated dosing schedule. The dosing schedule for children and adults is 2-3.6&nbsp;mg/kg/day intravenously for three days, then repeated every seven days for a total of three series.<ref name=CDC2013/> To monitor for relapse, follow-up is recommended every 6 months for at least 2 years.<ref name=":0" />

==Pharmacokinetics==
The [[half-life]] of melarsoprol is less than one hour, but bioassays indicate a 35-hour half-life. This is commonly associated with pharmacologic agents that have active metabolites. One such metabolite, Mel Ox, reaches maximum plasma levels about 15 minutes after melarsoprol injection. Melarsoprol clearance is 21.5 ml/min/kg and the Mel Ox half-life is approximately 3.9 hours.<ref name="“Ref 8">{{cite journal |author=Keiser J. |title=Investigations of the metabolites of the trypanocidal drug melarsoprol |journal=Clinical Pharmacology |volume=67 |pages=478–88 |year=2000 |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Ericsson O |author3=Burri C |doi=10.1067/mcp.2000.105990}}</ref>

==Society and culture==
Melarsoprol is produced by [[sanofi-aventis|Sanofi-Aventis]] and under an agreement with WHO, they donate melarsoprol to countries where the disease is common.
