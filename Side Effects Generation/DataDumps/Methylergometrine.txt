'''Methylergometrine''' (also called '''methylergonovine''', '''methylergobasin''', and '''''D''-[[lysergic acid]] 1-[[butanol]][[amide]]''') is a [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]] [[analog (chemistry)|analogue]] of [[ergonovine]], a [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] [[alkaloid]] found in [[ergot]], and many species of [[morning glory]].  It is a member of the [[ergoline]] family and chemically similar to [[LSD]], [[ergine]], [[ergometrine]], and [[lysergic acid]]. Due to its [[oxytocic]] properties, it has a medical use in [[obstetrics]]. According to [[Jonathan Ott]], methylergonovine has [[LSD]]-like actions above 2 milligrams{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}, due to its agonistic action at the [[5HT2A|5HT<sub>2A</sub>]]-[[Metabotropic glutamate receptor 2|mGlu2]] receptor [[protomer]]s. Clinical efficacy occurs around 200&nbsp;µg, ten times lower than the hallucinogenic threshold.

'''Methylergometrine maleate''' is marketed under the trade name '''Methergine'''.

==Uses==

===Obstetric use===
Methylergometrine is a smooth muscle constrictor that mostly acts on the [[uterus]]. It is most commonly used to prevent or control excessive bleeding following childbirth and spontaneous or elective abortion, and also to aid in expulsion of retained products of conception after a missed abortion (miscarriage in which all or part of the fetus remains in the uterus) and to help deliver the placenta after childbirth. It is available as tablets or injection ([[intramuscular injection|IM]] or [[intravenous therapy|IV]]) or in liquid form to be taken orally.<ref name="Austria-Codex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Jasek, W|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2007|edition=62nd|isbn=978-3-85200-181-4|pages=5193–5|language=German}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last1=Mutschler|first1=Ernst|last2=Schäfer-Korting|first2=Monika|title=Arzneimittelwirkungen|language=German|location=Stuttgart|publisher=Wissenschaftliche Verlagsgesellschaft|year=2001|edition=8|page=447|isbn=3-8047-1763-2}}</ref><ref>Fachinformation des Arzneimittel-Kompendium der Schweiz: [http://www.kompendium.ch/Monographie.aspx?Id=c2bb9f2c-77a5-46c6-b9e5-dfd5b50e7c89&lang=de&MonType=fi Methergin] {{de icon}}</ref>

===Migraine===
Methylergometrine is sometimes used for both prevention<ref>{{cite journal|last=Koehler|first=PJ|author2=Tfelt-Hansen PC|title=History of methysergide in migraine.|journal=Cephalalgia|date=Nov 2008|volume=28|issue=11|pmid=18644039|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2982.2008.01648.x|pages=1126–35}}</ref>  and acute treatment<ref>{{cite journal|last=Niño-Maldonado|first=Alfredo|author2=Gary Caballero-García |author3=Wilfrido Mercado-Bochero |author4=Fernando Rico-Villademoros |author5=Elena P Calandre |title=Efficacy and tolerability of intravenous methylergonovine in migraine female patients attending the emergency department: a pilot open-label study|journal=Head Face Med|date=8 Nov 2009|volume=5|issue=21|doi=10.1186/1746-160X-5-21|pmc=2780385|pmid=19895705}}</ref> of migraine. It is an active metabolite of [[methysergide]].

==Contraindications==
Methylergometrine is contraindicated in patients with [[hypertension]] and preeclampsia.<ref name="Austria-Codex" /> It is also contraindicated in [[HIV]] positive patients taking [[protease inhibitors]], [[delavirdine]] and [[efavirenz]] (which is also an agonist at the 5HT<sub>2A</sub>-mGlu2 receptor protomer and increases the chances of a patient experiencing hallucinations during methylergometrine therapy).<ref>http://www.drugs.com/monograph/methylergonovine-maleate.html</ref>

==Side effects==
Adverse effects include:<ref name="Austria-Codex" />
* [[Cholinergic]] effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea
* Dizziness
* Pulmonary hypertension{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* Coronary artery vasoconstriction
* Severe systemic hypertension (especially in patients with [[preeclampsia]])
* Convulsions

In excessive doses, methylergometrine can also lead to cramping, [[respiratory depression]] and coma.<ref name="Austria-Codex" />

==Interactions==
Methylergometrine likely interacts with drugs that inhibit the liver enzyme [[CYP3A4]], such as [[azole antifungal]]s, [[macrolide antibiotic]]s and many HIV drugs. It can also increase constriction of blood vessels caused by [[sympathomimetic]] drugs and other ergot alkaloids.<ref name="Austria-Codex" />

==Mechanism of action==
Methylergometrine is a partial agonist/antagonist on [[serotonergic]], [[dopaminergic]] and [[alpha-adrenergic]] receptors. Its specific binding and activation pattern on these receptors leads to a highly, if not completely, specific contraction of smooth uterus muscle via [[5-HT2A|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]] serotonin receptors,<ref>{{cite book |author=Heinz Pertz, Eckart Eich |editor=Vladimír Křen,Ladislav Cvak |title=Ergot: the genus Claviceps |year=1999 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-905702375-0 |pages=411–440 |chapter=Ergot alkaloids and their derivatives as ligands for serotoninergic, dopaminergic and adrenergic receptors}}</ref> while blood vessels are affected to a lesser extent compared to other ergot alkaloids.<ref name="Austria-Codex" />
