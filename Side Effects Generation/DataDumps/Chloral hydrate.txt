'''Chloral hydrate''' is a [[geminal diol]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] [[Carbon|C]]<sub>2</sub>[[Hydrogen|H]]<sub>3</sub>[[Chlorine|Cl]]<sub>3</sub>[[Oxygen|O]]<sub>2</sub>.  It is a colorless solid.  It has limited use as a [[sedative]] and [[hypnotic]] [[pharmaceutical drug]].  It is also a useful laboratory [[chemical reagent]] and precursor. It is derived from [[chloral]] (trichloroacetaldehyde) by the addition of one equivalent of water.

It was discovered through the chlorination ([[halogenation]]) of [[ethanol]] in 1832 by [[Justus von Liebig]] in [[Gießen]].<ref>{{cite journal

==Uses==
===Hypnotic===
Chloral hydrate is used for the short-term treatment of [[insomnia]] and as a sedative before minor medical or dental treatment. It was largely displaced in the mid-20th century by [[barbiturate]]s<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tariq | first1 = Syed H. | last2 = Pulisetty | first2 = Shailaja | year = 2008 | title = Pharmacotherapy for Insomnia | url = | journal = Clinics in Geriatric Medicine | volume = 24 | issue = 1| pages = 93–105 | doi = 10.1016/j.cger.2007.08.009 | pmid = 18035234 }}</ref> and subsequently by [[benzodiazepine]]s. It was also formerly used in veterinary medicine as a [[general anesthetic]] but is not considered acceptable for anesthesia or euthanasia of small animals due to adverse effects.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baxter|first=Mark G.|last2=Murphy|first2=Kathy L.|last3=Taylor|first3=Polly M.|last4=Wolfensohn|first4=Sarah E.|date=2009-07-01|title=Chloral Hydrate Is Not Acceptable for Anesthesia or Euthanasia of Small Animals|url=http://anesthesiology.pubs.asahq.org/article.aspx?articleid=1926213|journal=Anesthesiology: The Journal of the American Society of Anesthesiologists|volume=111|issue=1|pages=209–209|doi=10.1097/aln.0b013e3181a8617e|issn=0003-3022}}</ref> It is also still used as a sedative prior to [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] procedures, as it is one of the few available sedatives that does not suppress [[epilepsy|epileptiform]] discharges.<ref>http://jcc.kau.edu.sa/Files/140/Researches/11822_Chloral.pdf</ref>

In therapeutic doses for insomnia, chloral hydrate is effective within 20 to 60 minutes.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Chloral hydrate: a hypnotic best forgotten? |vauthors=Gauillard J, Cheref S, Vacherontrystram MN, Martin JC | journal=Encephale |date=May–Jun 2002 | volume=28 | issue=3 Pt 1 | pages=200–204 | pmid=12091779}}</ref> In humans it is [[Metabolism|metabolized]] within 7 hours into [[trichloroethanol]] and trichloroethanol glucuronide by erythrocytes and plasma esterases and into [[trichloroacetic acid]] in 4 to 5 days.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/htdocs/st_rpts/tox059.pdf | title=NTP Technical Report on the Toxicity and Metabolism Studies of Chloral Hydrate | publisher=National Toxicology Program | work=Toxicity Report Series Number 59 | accessdate=March 14, 2013 | author=Beland, Frederick A. | pages=10}}</ref> It has a very narrow therapeutic window making this drug difficult to use. Higher doses can depress [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] and [[blood pressure]].

===Building block in organic synthesis===
Chloral hydrate is a starting point for the synthesis of other organic compounds. It is the starting material for the production of [[chloral]], which is produced by the distillation of a mixture of chloral hydrate and [[sulfuric acid]], which serves as the [[desiccant]].

Notably, it is used to synthesize [[isatin]]. In this synthesis, chloral hydrate reacts with [[aniline]] and [[hydroxylamine]] to give a condensation product which cyclicizes in [[sulfuric acid]] to give the target compound:<ref>{{OrgSynth | title = Isatin | author = C. S. Marvel and G. S. Hiers | collvol = 1 | collvolpages = 327 | year = 1941 | prep = cv1p0327}}</ref>

==Safety==
Chloral hydrate was routinely administered to people on the gram scale.  Prolonged exposure to the vapors is unhealthy however, with a [[Median lethal dose|LD<sub>50</sub>]] for 4-hour exposure of 440&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup>.  Long-term use of chloral hydrate is associated with a rapid development of tolerance to its effects and possible addiction as well as adverse effects including rashes, gastric discomfort and severe kidney, heart, and liver failure.<ref>{{Cite book | vauthors = Gelder M, Mayou R, Geddes J| year = 2005 | title = Psychiatry | edition = 3rd | location = New York: Oxford | page = 238}}</ref>

Acute overdosage is often characterized by [[nausea]], vomiting, confusion, [[convulsion]]s, slow and irregular breathing, [[cardiac arrhythmia]], and [[coma]]. The [[Blood plasma|plasma]], [[Blood serum|serum]] or [[blood]] concentrations of chloral hydrate and/or trichloroethanol, its major active metabolite, may be measured to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of fatalities. Accidental [[Drug overdose|overdosage]] of young children undergoing simple dental or surgical procedures has occurred. [[Hemodialysis]] has been used successfully to accelerate clearance of the drug in poisoning victims.<ref>{{Cite book | author = R. Baselt | title = Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man | edition = 8th  | publisher = Biomedical Publications | location = Foster City, CA | year = 2008 | pages = 259–261}}</ref>

==Production==
Chloral hydrate is produced from [[chlorine]] and [[ethanol]] in acidic solution. In basic conditions the [[haloform reaction]] takes place and chloral hydrate is [[Chemical decomposition|decomposed]] by [[hydrolysis]] to form [[chloroform]].<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://jhs.pharm.or.jp/data/49%281%29/49_1.pdf | title=A Problem in the Determination of Trihalomethane by Headspace-Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry |author1=Takahashi, Yasuo |author2=Onodera, Sukeo |author3=Morita, Masatoshi |author4=Terao, Yoshiyasu | journal=Journal of Health Science | year=2003 | volume=49 | issue=1 | pages=3 | doi=10.1248/jhs.49.1}}</ref>

==Pharmacodynamics==
Chloral hydrate is metabolized ''[[in vivo]]''<ref>[[Trichloroethanol]]</ref> to [[trichloroethanol]], which is responsible for its physiological and psychological effects.<ref name=Ull>Reinhard Jira, Erwin Kopp, Blaine C. McKusick, Gerhard Röderer, Axel Bosch and Gerald Fleischmann "Chloroacetaldehydes" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', 2007, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a06_527.pub2}}</ref>

The metabolite of chloral hydrate exerts its pharmacological properties via enhancing the [[GABA receptor]] complex<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=17557503 |year=2006 |last1=Lu |first1=J |last2=Greco |title=Sleep circuitry and the hypnotic mechanism of GABAA drugs |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=S19–26 |journal=Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine|first2=MA }}</ref> and therefore is similar in action to  [[benzodiazepine]]s, [[nonbenzodiazepines]] and [[barbiturates]]. It can be moderately [[Substance use disorder|addictive]], as [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] use is known to cause [[Chemical dependency|dependency]] and [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms. The chemical can potentiate various [[anticoagulant]]s and is weakly [[mutagen]]ic ''[[in vitro]]'' and ''in vivo''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

==Legal status==
In the United States, chloral hydrate is illegal without a prescription and is a [[Schedule IV (US)|schedule IV]] [[controlled substance]]. Its properties have sometimes led to its use as a [[date rape drug]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Canadian Public Health Association |date= December 2004 |title=Rising Incidence of Hospital-reported Drug-facilitated Sexual Assault in a Large Urban Community in Canada: Retrospective Population-based Study  |url= |journal=Canadian Journal of Public Health |volume=95 |issue=6 |pages=441 |doi= |access-date= February 10, 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/10/25/2008-10-25_attacked_by_the_gang.html?page=0 New York Daily News, 10/25/2008]</ref> Chloral hydrate is still available in the United States, though it is relatively uncommon and not often kept in the inventory of major pharmacies. It has largely been abandoned for the treatment of insomnia in favor of newer drugs such as the [[Z-drug]]s family, which includes [[zolpidem]], [[zaleplon]], [[zopiclone]] and [[eszopiclone]]. A small number of medical practitioners continue to prescribe it to treat insomnia when all other more modern medications have failed. In the United States, it is commonly supplied in syrup form in a 500&nbsp;mg/5mL concentration. It is also supplied in suppository form, though the use of this method of administration is extremely rare.

It is not controlled in Canada except that a prescription is required to purchase the pharmaceutical forms. Possession without a prescription is not illegal and industrial trade is not regulated.

The United Kingdom does not consider chloral hydrate to be a [[Drugs controlled by the UK Misuse of Drugs Act|controlled substance]].

Chloral hydrate is a prescription-only-medicine (POM) in the [[Netherlands]], but possession without a valid prescription will result only in the seizure of the drug, not prosecution. Production, sale and distribution are however punishable by law. It is not listed under the Dutch [[Opium Law]], but when the intent is human consumption, it is covered by the ''Geneesmiddelenwet'' (Medicine Act).

==Hoyer's mounting medium==
Chloral hydrate is also an ingredient used for Hoyer's solution, a [[mounting medium]] for microscopic observation of diverse organisms such as [[bryophyte]]s, [[fern]]s, [[seed]]s, and small [[arthropod]]s (especially [[mite]]s). Other ingredients may include  [[gum arabic]] and [[glycerol]] . An advantage of this medium include a high refraction index and clearing (macerating) properties of the small specimens (especially advantageous if specimens require observation with [[differential interference contrast microscopy]]). {{cn|date=June 2017}}

== History ==
Chloral hydrate was first synthesized by the chemist [[Justus von Liebig]] in 1832 at the University of Giessen.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60169541|title=A history of psychiatry : from the era of the asylum to the age of Prozac.|last=Edward.|first=Shorter,|date=1998-01-01|publisher=Wiley|isbn=0471245313|oclc=60169541}}</ref> Through experimentation physiologist [[Claude Bernard]] clarified that the chloral hydrate was [[hypnotic]] as opposed to an [[analgesic]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/878623979|title=The worst of evils : the fight against pain|last=Thomas.|first=Dormandy,|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300113226|oclc=878623979}}</ref> It was the first of a long line of sedatives, most notably the [[Barbiturate|barbiturates]], manufactured and marketed by the German pharmaceutical industry.<ref name=":0" /> Historically, chloral hydrate was utilized primarily as a [[psychiatric medication]]. In 1869, German physician and pharmacologist [[Oscar Liebreich]] began to promote its use to calm anxiety, especially when it caused insomnia.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/299368559|title=Before Prozac : the troubled history of mood disorders in psychiatry|last=Edward.|first=Shorter,|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195368741|oclc=299368559}}</ref><ref name=":1" /> Chloral hydrate had certain advantages over [[morphine]] for this application, as it worked quickly without injection and had a consistent strength. It achieved wide use in both asylums and the homes of those socially refined enough to avoid asylums. Upper and middle class women, well-represented in the latter category, were particularly susceptible to chloral hydrate addiction. After the 1904 invention of [[barbital]], the first of the [[barbiturate]] family, chloral hydrate began to disappear from use among those with means.<ref name=":0" /> It remained common in asylums and hospitals until the Second World War as it was quite cheap. Chloral hydrate had some other important advantages that kept it in use for five decades despite the existence of more advanced barbiturates. It was the safest available sedative until the middle of the twentieth century, and thus was thus particularly favored for children.<ref name=":1" /> It also left patients much more refreshed after a deep sleep than more recently invented sedatives. Its frequency of use made it an early and regular feature in [[The Merck Manuals|the Merck Manual]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cuadrado|first=Fernando F.|last2=Alston|first2=Theodore A.|date=2016-10-01|title=Book Review|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352452915300438|journal=Journal of Anesthesia History|language=English|volume=2|issue=4|pages=153–155|doi=10.1016/j.janh.2016.01.004|issn=2352-4529}}</ref>

Chloral hydrate also was also a significant object of study in various early pharmacological experiments. In 1875, Claude Bernard tried to tell if chloral hydrate exerted its action through a metabolic conversion to chloroform. This was not only the first attempt to determine whether different drugs were converted to the same metabolite in the body but also the first to measure the concentration of a particular pharmaceutical in the blood. The results were inconclusive.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alston|first=Theodore A.|date=2016-07-01|title=Noteworthy Chemistry of Chloroform|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352452916300068|journal=Journal of Anesthesia History|language=English|volume=2|issue=3|pages=85–88|doi=10.1016/j.janh.2016.04.008|issn=2352-4529}}</ref> In 1899 and 1901 [[Hans Horst Meyer]] and [[Ernest Overton]] respectively made the major discovery that the [[Theories of general anaesthetic action|general anaesthetic action]] of a drug was strongly correlated to its lipid solubility. But, chloral hydrate was quite polar but nonetheless a potent hypnotic. Overton was unable to explain this mystery. Thus, chloral hydrate remained one of the major and persistent exceptions to this breakthrough discovery in pharmacology. This anomaly was eventually resolved in 1948, when Claude Bernard's experiment was repeated. While chloral hydrate was converted to a different metabolite than chloroform, it was found that was converted into the more lipophilic molecule [[2,2,2-Trichloroethanol]]. This metabolite fit much better with the Meyer-Overton correlation than chloral had. Prior to this, it had not been demonstrated that general anesthetics could undergo chemical changes to exert their action in the body.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krasowski|first=Matthew D.|title=Contradicting a Unitary Theory of General Anesthetic Action: a History of Three Compounds from 1901 to 2001|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1522864903500312|journal=Bulletin of Anesthesia History|language=en|volume=21|issue=3|pages=1–24|doi=10.1016/s1522-8649(03)50031-2}}</ref>

Finally, chloral hydrate was also the first hypnotic to be used intravenously as a general anesthetic. In 1871, Pierre-Cyprien Oré began experiments on animals, followed by humans. While a state of general anesthesia could be achieved, the technique never caught on because its administration was more complex and less safe than the oral administration of chloral hydrate, and less safe for intravenous use than later general anesthetics were found to be.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Matthew|last2=Jagdish|first2=S.|date=2016-01-01|title=A History of Intravenous Anesthesia in War (1656-1988)|url=http://www.anesthesiahistoryjournal.org/article/S2352-4529(15)00084-5/fulltext|journal=Journal of Anesthesia History|language=English|volume=2|issue=1|pages=13–21|doi=10.1016/j.janh.2015.10.007|issn=2352-4529}}</ref>
