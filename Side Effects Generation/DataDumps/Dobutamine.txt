'''Dobutamine''' is a [[sympathomimetic]] [[drug]] used in the treatment of [[heart failure]] and [[cardiogenic shock]]. Its primary mechanism is direct stimulation of [[beta receptor|β<sub>1</sub> receptors]] of the [[sympathetic nervous system]]. Dobutamine was developed in the 1970s by Drs. Ronald Tuttle and Jack Mills at [[Eli Lilly and Company]], as a [[analog (chemistry)|structural analogue]] of [[isoprenaline]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Tuttle RR, Mills J |title=Dobutamine: development of a new catecholamine to selectively increase cardiac contractility |journal=Circ Res |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=185–96 |date=January 1975 |pmid=234805 |url=http://circres.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/36/1/185 |doi=10.1161/01.RES.36.1.185}}</ref>

==Clinical uses==
Dobutamine is used to treat acute but potentially reversible [[heart failure]], such as which occurs during [[cardiac surgery]] or in cases of [[Septic shock|septic]] or cardiogenic shock, on the basis of its positive [[inotrope|inotropic]] action.<ref name="rang">{{cite book |vauthors=Rang HP, Dale MM, Ritter JM, Flower RJ |title=Rang and Dale's Pharmacology}}</ref>

Dobutamine can be used in cases of [[congestive heart failure]] to increase cardiac output. It is indicated when [[Total parenteral nutrition|parenteral therapy]] is necessary for inotropic support in the short-term treatment of patients with cardiac [[decompensation]] due to depressed [[contractility]], which could be the result of either organic heart disease or cardiac surgical procedures. It is not useful in [[ischemic heart disease]] because it increases heart rate and thus increases myocardial oxygen demand.{{Citation needed|reason=cursory web search indicates that dobutamine is not chronotropic at standard doses|date=September 2016}}

The drug is also commonly used in the hospital setting as a pharmacologic stress testing agent to identify coronary artery disease.

==Adverse effects==

Primary side effects include those commonly seen for β<sub>1</sub> active sympathomimetics, such as [[hypertension]], [[angina]], [[arrhythmia]], and [[tachycardia]]. Used with caution in atrial fibrillation as it has the effect of increasing the atrioventricular (AV) conduction.<ref name=pharmnemonics>{{Cite book | author=Shen, Howard | title=Illustrated Pharmacology Memory Cards: PharMnemonics | year=2008 | publisher=Minireview | isbn=1-59541-101-1 | page=6}}</ref>

The most dangerous side effect of dobutamine is increased risk of arrhythmia, including fatal arrhythmias.

==Pharmacology==
Dobutamine is a direct-acting agent whose primary activity results from stimulation of the [[beta-1 adrenoceptor|β<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors]] of the heart, increasing contractility and cardiac output.  Since it does not act on [[dopamine receptor]]s to induce the release of [[norepinephrine]] (another α<sub>1</sub> agonist), dobutamine is less prone to induce hypertension than is [[dopamine]].

Dobutamine is predominantly a [[beta-1 agonist|β<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic agonist]], with weak β<sub>2</sub> activity, and [[alpha-1 receptor|α<sub>1</sub>]] selective activity, although it is used clinically in cases of cardiogenic shock for its β<sub>1</sub> [[inotropic]] effect in increasing heart contractility and cardiac output. Dobutamine is administered as a [[racemic mixture]] consisting of both (+) and (−) [[chirality (chemistry)|isomer]]s; the (+) isomer is a potent β<sub>1</sub> agonist and α<sub>1</sub> antagonist, while the (−) isomer is an α<sub>1</sub> agonist.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Parker K, Brunton L, Goodman LS, Blumenthal D, Buxton I |title=Goodman & Gilman's manual of pharmacology and therapeutics |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |location= |year=2008 |pages=159 |isbn=0-07-144343-6}}</ref> The administration of the racemate results in the overall β<sub>1</sub> agonism responsible for its activity. (+)-Dobutamine also has mild β<sub>2</sub> agonist activity, which makes it useful as a vasodilator.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Tibayan FA, Chesnutt AN, Folkesson HG, Eandi J, Matthay MA |title=Dobutamine increases alveolar liquid clearance in ventilated rats by beta-2 receptor stimulation |journal=Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. |volume=156 |issue=2 Pt 1 |pages=438–44 |year=1997 |pmid=9279221 |doi=10.1164/ajrccm.156.2.9609141}}</ref>
