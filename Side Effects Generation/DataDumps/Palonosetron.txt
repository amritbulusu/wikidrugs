'''Palonosetron''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], trade name '''Aloxi''') is a [[5-HT3 antagonist|5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonist]] used in the prevention and treatment of [[chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting]] (CINV). It is used for the control of delayed CINV—nausea and vomiting and there are tentative data to suggest that it may be more effective than [[granisetron]].<ref name="Billio">{{cite journal|last=Billio|first=A|author2=Morello, E |author3=Clarke, MJ |title=Serotonin receptor antagonists for highly emetogenic chemotherapy in adults.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=Jan 20, 2010|issue=1|pages=CD006272|pmid=20091591|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006272.pub2}}</ref>

Palonosetron is administered [[intravenous therapy|intravenously]], as a single dose, 30 minutes before chemotherapy,<ref name="pmid17106506">{{cite journal |author=De Leon A |title=Palonosetron (Aloxi): a second-generation 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting |journal=Proceedings (Baylor University.

The oral formulation was approved on August 22, 2008 for prevention of acute CINV alone, as a large clinical trial did not show oral administration to be as effective as intravenous use against delayed CINV.<ref name=Medscape/>

The oral combination [[netupitant/palonosetron]] is approved for both acute and delayed CINV.<ref name="EPAR" />

==Adverse effects==
The most common adverse effects are headache, which occurs in 4–11% of patients, and constipation in up to 6% of patients. In less than 1% of patients, other [[gastrointestinal disorder]]s occur, as well as [[sleeplessness]], [[First-degree atrioventricular block|first-]] and [[second-degree atrioventricular block]], [[myalgia|muscle pain]] and [[dyspnoea|shortness of breath]]. Palonosetron is similarly well tolerated as other setrons, and slightly less than [[placebo]].<ref name="AC" /><ref name="Dinnendahl" />

==Interactions==
Palonosetron does not relevantly inhibit or induce [[cytochrome P450]] liver enzymes. There are case reports about [[serotonin syndrome]] when the drug is combined with [[serotonergic]] substances such as [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs) and [[serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s (SNRIs), two common types of antidepressants.<ref name="AC">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2015|language=German}}</ref><ref name="Dinnendahl" />

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
Palonosetron is a [[5-HT3 antagonist|5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonist]], commonly known as a ''setron''. These drugs act by blocking [[serotonin]] from binding to the [[5-HT3 receptor|5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor]].<ref name="Billio" />

===Pharmacokinetics===
Orally taken palonosetron is absorbed well from the gut and has a [[bioavailability]] of 97%. Highest blood plasma levels are reached after 5.1±1.7 hours, independently of food intake, and [[plasma protein binding]] is 62%. 40% of the substance are eliminated in the unchanged form, and a further 45–50% are metabolized by the liver enzyme [[CYP2D6]] and to a lesser extent by [[CYP3A4]] and [[CYP1A2]]. The two main metabolites, the [[Amine oxide|''N''-oxide]] and a [[hydroxyl|hydroxy]] derivative, have less than 1% of palonosetron's antagonistic effect and are thus practically inactive.<ref name="AC" /><ref name="Dinnendahl" />

Palonosetron and its metabolites are mainly (to 80–93%) eliminated via the kidney. [[Biological half-life]] in healthy persons was 37±12 hours in a study, and 48±19 hours in cancer patients. In 10% of patients, half-life is over 100 hours.<ref name="AC" /><ref name="Dinnendahl" /> Most other marketed setrons have half-lives in the range of about two to 15 hours.
