'''Enobosarm''', also known as '''ostarine''', is an investigational [[selective androgen receptor modulator]] (SARM) from [[Gtx inc|GTX, Inc]] for treatment of conditions such as [[muscle]] wasting and [[osteoporosis]], formerly under development by [[Merck & Company]].<ref>[http://www.google.com/patents?id=zmSBAAAAEBAJ&dq=6569896 James T.

According to a recent paper authored by GTx, "Readers are cautioned to note that the name ostarine is often mistakenly linked to the chemical structure of [S-4], which is also known as [[andarine]].

==Doping==
Selective androgen receptor modulators may be used by athletes to assist in training and increase physical stamina and fitness, potentially producing effects similar to [[anabolic steroid]]s. For this reason, SARMs were banned by the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] in January 2008 despite no drugs from this class yet being in clinical use, and blood tests for all known SARMs have been developed.<ref>Thevis M, Kohler M, Schlörer N, Kamber M, Kühn A, Linscheid MW, Schänzer W.

In June 2013, professional cyclist [[Nikita Novikov]] was provisionally suspended after a possible breach of anti-doping rules, due to a positive A-sample result for Ostarine.<ref>http://www.vacansoleildcm.co.uk/nieuws/nikita-novikov-provisionally-suspended-after-possible-breach-of-anti-doping-rules.html</ref>

UFC Fighter [[Tim Means]] was pulled from a fight in February 2017 after testing positive for Ostarine in a pre-fight drug screening administered by USADA.<ref>http://mmajunkie.com/2016/02/tim-means-pulled-from-ufc-fight-night-83-headliner-after-failed-usada-test</ref>

In June 2015 Azerbaijan's Chaltu Beji tested positive for doping at the [[2015 European Games]] in Baku. The 18-year-old Ethiopian-born Beji tested positive for the banned substance Ostarine in a urine sample with a B sample confirming the result. She won the 3,000-meter steeplechase event despite falling at the last water jump, she was disqualified because of the positive tests.<ref>http://www.dpa-international.com/news/sports2/azerbaijans-beji-fails-doping-test-at-european-games-a-45758559.html</ref>

In May 2016, Romanian-Canadian professional boxer [[Lucian Bute]], former super middleweight world titleholder, tested positive for Ostarine after his draw against Swedish professional boxer and titleholder [[Badou Jack]] on April 30 at the [[D.C. Armory]] in Washington, D.C.<ref>http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/15751796/lucian-bute-tested-positive-draw-vs-badou-jack</ref>

On December 16, 2016, Russian heavyweight boxer [[Alexander Povetkin|Alexandre Povetkin]] tested positive for Ostarine less than a day before an interim WBC title fight against former WBC champ [[Bermane Stiverne]]. The fight, which was scheduled for December 17 in [[Yekaterinburg]], Russia, was cancelled.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rt.com/sport/370620-povetkin-positive-test-boxing/|title=Russian boxer Povetkin tests positive, fight with Canadian Stiverne cancelled – WBC|newspaper=RT International|language=en-EN|access-date=2016-12-17}}</ref>

In March 2016, Australian triathlete Lisa Marangon received a 4-year ban ending in March 2020 for use of banned substance Ostarine. American triathlete Ashley Paulson was given a 6-month suspension for use of banned substance Ostarine because officials accepted her contention that the banned drug positive came from a contaminated supplement.<ref>http://www.slowtwitch.com/Features/2016_Triathlon_Year_in_Review_6159.html</ref>

In February 2017, American triathlete Beth Gerdes was given a 2-year suspension for presence of ostarine, and American triathlete Lauren Barnett was given a 6-month suspension for the presence of Ostarine. Both triathletes claimed contamination from salt tablet supplements. Lauren Barnett was able to provide tablets and sealed bottle tablets which both tested positive for contamination, thus only the 6-month suspension. The 2-year suspension still stands for Beth Gerdes who provided tablets for testing, but tests showed only low levels of ostarine not high enough to confirm the finding. .<ref>http://triathlonmagazine.ca/feature/two-american-pro-triathletes-reveal-doping-violations-today/</ref>

In February 2017, [[UFC]] light heavyweight [[Tom Lawlor]] was suspended for two years following a positive test for ostarine.<ref>http://mmajunkie.com/2017/02/tom-lawlor-gets-2-year-suspension-from-usada-for-ostarine</ref>

==Recalls==
May 2017: Dynamic Technical Formulations LLC. is voluntarily recalling all lots of Tri-Ton, a dietary supplement found to contain ostarine and andarine.<ref>https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm559907.htm</ref>
