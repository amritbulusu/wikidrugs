'''Ethoheptazine'''<ref>ES Patent 310184</ref> (trade name '''Zactane''') is an [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] from the phenazepane family. It was invented in the 1950s<ref>Batterman RC, Golbey M, Grossman AJ, Leifer P. Analgesic effectiveness of orally administered ethoheptazine in man. ''American Journal of the Medical Sciences''. 1957 Oct;234(4):413-9.</ref> and is related to other drugs such as [[proheptazine]] and [[pethidine]].<ref>Diamond J, Bruce WF, Tyson FT. Synthesis and Properties of the Analgesic DL-Î±-1,3-dimethyl-4-phenyl-4-propionoxyazacycloheptane (Proheptazine). ''Journal of Medicinal Chemistry''. 1964 Jan;7:57-60.</ref>

Ethoheptazine produces similar effects to other opioids, including [[analgesia]], [[sedation]], [[dizziness]] and [[nausea]].<ref>Cinelli P, Zucchini M. Current pharmaco-therapeutic possibilities in the treatment of pain. Experiments with ethoeptazine. (Italian). ''Minerva Medica''. 1962 Mar 3;53:637-42.</ref> It was sold by itself as '''Zactane''', and is still available as a combination product with [[acetylsalicylic acid]] and [[meprobamate]] as '''[[Equagesic]]''', which is used for the treatment of conditions where both pain and anxiety are present.<ref>Scheiner JJ, Richards DJ. Treatment of musculoskeletal pain and associated anxiety with an ethoheptazine-aspirin-meprobamate combination (equagesic): a controlled study. ''Current Therapeutic Research, Clinical and Experimental''. 1974 Sep;16(9):928-36.</ref>    It was also investigated for use as an antitussive.<ref>J Pharmacol Exp Ther November 1979 211:401-408</ref>

Its no longer sold in the United States however it may be sold again if the law is changed to remove the drug from the CSD. Ethoheptazine is not listed as a controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act 1970 in the United States.<ref>http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/quotas/conv_factor/index.html</ref> The controlled status (Schedule IV) of Equagesic was due to the [[meprobamate]] content.<ref>PDR 1978, pp 1618</ref><ref>http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/quotas/conv_factor/index.html</ref>  Regulation elsewhere varies. The Canadian Controlled Drugs & Substances act specifically excludes the phenazepine opioids, including [[proheptazine]], from control.<ref>http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-38.8/</ref>
