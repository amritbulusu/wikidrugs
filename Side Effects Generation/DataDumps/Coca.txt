'''Coca''' is any of the four cultivated plants in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Erythroxylaceae]], native to western South America.

The plant is grown as a [[cash crop]] in [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Peru]], even in areas where its cultivation is unlawful.<ref name="Plowman1979">{{cite journal

There are some reports that the plant is being cultivated in the south of [[Mexico]] as a [[cash crop]] and an alternative to [[smuggling]] its recreational product [[cocaine]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=De la Cruz|first1=Manuel|title=Policía mexicana realiza el primer hallazgo de cultivos de coca en el sur del país|url=http://larepublica.pe/11-09-2014/policia-mexicana-realiza-el-primer-hallazgo-de-cultivos-de-coca-en-el-sur-del-pais|website=La Republica|accessdate=27 March 2016}}</ref>
It also plays a role in many traditional [[Inca Empire|Andean cultures]] as well as the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta#Inhabitants|Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] (see [[Coca#Traditional uses|Traditional uses]]). 

Coca is known throughout the world for its psychoactive [[alkaloid]], [[cocaine]]. The alkaloid content of coca leaves is relatively low, between 0.25% and 0.77%.<ref name="Plowman1983">{{cite journal

== Description ==
The coca plant resembles a [[blackthorn]] bush, and grows to a height of {{convert|2|to|3|m|ft|0|abbr=off}}. The branches are straight, and the leaves are thin, opaque, oval, and taper at the extremities. A marked characteristic of the leaf is an areolated portion bounded by two longitudinal curved lines, one line on each side of the midrib, and more conspicuous on the under face of the leaf.

The flowers are small, and disposed in clusters on short stalks; the corolla is composed of five yellowish-white [[petal]]s, the [[anther]]s are heart-shaped, and the [[pistil]] consists of three carpels united to form a three-chambered ovary. The flowers mature into red [[berry (botany)|berries]].

The leaves are sometimes eaten by the [[larva]]e of the [[moth]] ''[[Eloria noyesi]]''.

== Species and evolution ==
There are two species of cultivated coca, each with two varieties:
*''[[Erythroxylum coca]]''
**''Erythroxylum coca'' var. ''coca'' (Bolivian or [[Huánuco]] Coca) – well adapted to the eastern [[Andes]] of Peru and Bolivia, an area of humid, tropical, [[montane forest]].
**''Erythroxylum coca'' var. ''ipadu'' (Amazonian Coca) – cultivated in the lowland [[Amazon Basin]] in Peru and Colombia.
*''[[Erythroxylum novogranatense]]''
**''Erythroxylum novogranatense'' var. ''novogranatense'' (Colombian Coca) – a highland variety that is utilized in lowland areas. It is cultivated in drier regions found in Colombia. However, ''E. novogranatense'' is very adaptable to varying ecological conditions. The leaves have parallel lines on either side of the central vein.
**''Erythroxylum novogranatense'' var. ''truxillense'' ([[Trujillo Province, Peru|Trujillo]] Coca) – grown primarily in Peru and Colombia. the leaves of ''E. novogranatense'' var. ''truxillense'' does not have parallel lines on either side of the central vein like all other varieties.

All four of the cultivated cocas were domesticated in pre-Columbian times and are more closely related to each other than to any other species.<ref name="Plowman1979"/>

There are two main theories relating to the evolution of the cultivated cocas. The first (put forth by [[Timothy Plowman|Plowman]]<ref name="Plowman1984">Plowman T.  "The Origin, Evolution, and Diffusion of Coca, Erythroxylum spp., in South and Central America."  In: Stone D, ed. ''Pre-Columbian Plant Migration''.

''coca'' is ancestral, while ''[[Erythroxylum novogranatense]]'' var. ''truxillense'' is derived from it to be drought tolerant, and ''Erythroxylum novogranatense'' var. ''novogranatense'' derived from ''Erythroxylum novogranatense'' var. ''truxillense''.

There may be a common, but undiscovered ancestor.<ref name="Emche2011"/>

Wild populations of ''[[Erythroxylum coca]]'' var. ''coca'' are found in the eastern [[Andes]]; the other 3 [[taxon|taxa]] are only known as cultivated plants.

The two subspecies of ''[[Erythroxylum coca]]'' are almost indistinguishable phenotypically. ''[[Erythroxylum novogranatense]]'' var. ''novogranatense'' and ''[[Erythroxylum novogranatense]]'' var. ''truxillense'' are phenotypically similar, but morphologically distinguishable. Under the older [[Cronquist system]] of classifying [[flowering plant]]s, this was placed in an [[order (biology)|order]] [[Linales]]; more modern systems place it in the order [[Malpighiales]].

=== Herbicide resistant varieties ===
Also known as ''supercoca'' or ''la millionaria'', [[Boliviana negra]] is a relatively new form of coca that is resistant to a [[herbicide]] called [[glyphosate]]. Glyphosate is a key ingredient in the multibillion-dollar aerial [[coca eradication]] campaign undertaken by the government of Colombia with U.S. financial and military backing known as [[Plan Colombia]].

The herbicide resistance of this strain has at least two possible explanations: that a "[[peer-to-peer]]" network of coca farmers used [[plant breeding|selective breeding]] to enhance this trait through tireless effort, or the plant was [[genetic engineering|genetically modified]] in a laboratory. In 1996, a [[biological patent|patented]] glyphosate-resistant [[soybean]] was marketed by [[Monsanto Company]], suggesting that it would be possible to genetically modify coca in an analogous manner. Spraying ''Boliviana negra'' with glyphosate would serve to strengthen its growth by eliminating the non-resistant [[weed]]s surrounding it. Joshua Davis, in the ''Wired'' article cited below, found no evidence of CP4 EPSPS, a protein produced by the glyphosate-resistant soybean, suggesting ''Bolivana negra'' was either created in a lab by a different technique or bred in the field.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=DExN86ryRuwC&dq

== Cultivation ==
{{See also|Coca production in Colombia}}
[[File:Colcoca01.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Coca tree in Colombia]]

Coca is traditionally cultivated in the lower altitudes of the eastern slopes of the [[Andes]] (the [[Yungas]]), or the highlands depending on the species grown. Coca production begins in the valleys and upper jungle regions of the Andean region, where the countries of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia are host to more than 98 per cent of the global land area planted with coca.<ref name="Dion2008">{{cite journal

Fresh samples of the dried leaves, uncurled, are a deep green colour on the upper, and a grey-green on the lower surface, and have a strong [[tea]]-like aroma. When chewed, they produce a pleasurable numbness in the mouth, and have a pleasant, [[Piquance|pungent]] taste. They are traditionally chewed with [[lime (material)|lime]] or some other reagent such as [[bicarbonate of soda]] to increase the release of the active ingredients from the leaf. Older species have a [[camphor]]aceous smell and a brownish color, and lack the pungent taste.

The seeds are sown from December to January in small plots (''almacigas'') sheltered from the sun, and the young plants when at {{convert|40|to|60|cm|0|abbr=off}} in height are placed in final planting holes (''aspi''), or if the ground is level, in furrows (''uachos'') in carefully [[weed]]ed soil. The plants thrive best in hot, damp and humid locations, such as the clearings of forests; but the leaves most preferred are obtained in drier areas, on the hillsides. The leaves are gathered from plants varying in age from one and a half to upwards of forty years, but only the new fresh growth is harvested. They are considered ready for plucking when they break on being bent. The first and most abundant harvest is in March after the rainy season, the second is at the end of June, and the third in October or November. The green leaves (''matu'') are spread in thin layers on coarse [[wool]]len cloths and dried in the sun; they are then packed in sacks, which must be kept dry in order to preserve the quality of the leaves.

|title=Coca: the plant and its use
|author=Eleanor Carroll, M.A.
|accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref>

Coca chewing may originally have been limited to the eastern Andes before its introduction to the Inca. As the plant was viewed as having a divine origin, its cultivation became subject to a state monopoly and its use restricted to nobles and a few favored classes (court orators, couriers, favored public workers, and the army) by the rule of the [[Topa Inca]] (1471–1493). As the Incan empire declined, the leaf became more widely available. After some deliberation, [[Philip II of Spain]] issued a decree recognizing the drug as essential to the well-being of the Andean Indians but urging missionaries to end its religious use. The Spanish are believed to have effectively encouraged use of coca by an increasing majority of the population to increase their labor output and tolerance for starvation, but it is not clear that this was planned deliberately.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Coca was first introduced to Europe in the 16th century, but did not become popular until the mid-19th century, with the publication of an influential paper by Dr. [[Paolo Mantegazza]] praising its stimulating effects on cognition. This led to invention of [[coca wine]] and the first production of pure cocaine. Coca wine (of which [[Vin Mariani]] was the best-known brand) and other coca-containing preparations were widely sold as patent medicines and tonics, with claims of a wide variety of health benefits. The original version of [[Coca-Cola]] was among these. These products became illegal in most countries outside of South America in the early 20th century, after the addictive nature of cocaine was widely recognized. In 1859, [[Albert Niemann (chemist)|Albert Niemann]] of the [[University of Göttingen]] became the first person to isolate the chief alkaloid of coca, which he named "cocaine".<ref>{{cite book

In the early 20th century, the Dutch colony of [[Java]] became a leading exporter of [[coca leaf]]. By 1912 shipments to Amsterdam, where the leaves were processed into cocaine, reached 1000 tons, overtaking the Peruvian export market. Apart from the years of the First World War, Java remained a greater exporter of coca than Peru until the end of the 1920s.<ref name=Musto>{{cite journal

In recent times (2006), the governments of several South American countries, such as Peru, Bolivia and Venezuela, have defended and championed the traditional use of coca, as well as the modern uses of the leaf and its extracts in household products such as teas and toothpaste. The coca plant was also the inspiration for Bolivia's [[Coca Museum]].

== Traditional uses ==
[[File:Folha de coca.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Man holding coca leaf in Bolivia]]

=== Medicine ===
Traditional medical uses of coca are foremost as a stimulant to overcome fatigue, hunger, and thirst. It is considered particularly effective against [[altitude sickness]].<ref name="ReferenceB">[https://www.tni.org/en/primer/coca-leaf-myths-and-reality Transnational Institute – Coca Myths, 2009]</ref> It also is used as an [[anesthetic]] and analgesic to alleviate the pain of headache, [[rheumatism]], wounds and sores, etc. Before stronger anaesthetics were available, it also was used for broken bones, childbirth, and during [[trepanning]] operations on the skull.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> The high calcium content in coca explains why people used it for bone fractures.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> Because coca constricts blood vessels, it also serves to oppose bleeding, and coca seeds were used for [[nosebleed]]s. Indigenous use of coca has also been reported as a treatment for [[malaria]], [[peptic ulcer|ulcers]], [[asthma]], to improve [[digestion]], to guard against bowel laxity, as an [[aphrodisiac]], and credited with improving [[longevity]]. Modern studies have supported a number of these medical applications.<ref name="Weil"/><ref name="ReferenceB"/>

=== Nutrition ===
Raw coca leaves, chewed or consumed as tea or mate de coca, are rich in nutritional properties. Specifically, the coca plant contains essential minerals (calcium, potassium, phosphorus), vitamins (B1, B2, C, and E) and nutrients such as protein and fiber.<ref>James, A., Aulick, D., Plowman, T., 1975 "Nutritional Value of Coca", Botanical Museum Leaflets, Harvard University 24 (6): 113–119.</ref><ref>Harvard Study – Nutritional Value of Coca Leaf (Duke, Aulick, Plowman 1975)</ref>

=== Religion ===
Coca has also been a vital part of the religious cosmology of the Andean peoples of Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, northern Argentina, and Chile from the [[Pre-Inca cultures|pre-Inca period]] through to the present. Coca leaves play a crucial part in offerings to the [[apus]] (mountains), [[Inti]] (the sun), or [[Pachamama]] (the earth). Coca leaves are also often read in a form of [[divination]] analogous to [[reading tea leaves]] in other cultures. As one example of the many traditional beliefs about coca, it is believed by the miners of [[Cerro de Pasco]] to soften the veins of [[ore]], if masticated (chewed) and thrown upon them (see '''Cocomama''' in [[Inca mythology]]).{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} In addition, coca use in shamanic rituals is well documented wherever local native populations have cultivated the plant. For example, the Tayronas of Colombia's Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta would chew the plant before engaging in extended meditation and prayer.<ref name="banrep.gov.co">{{cite web

The activity of chewing coca is called ''mambear'', ''chacchar'' or ''acullicar'', borrowed from [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], ''coquear'' (northern Argentina), or in Bolivia, ''picchar'', derived from the [[Aymara language]]. The Spanish ''masticar'' is also frequently used, along with the slang term "bolear," derived from the word "bola" or ball of coca pouched in the cheek while chewing. Typical coca consumption is about {{convert|2|oz|g|abbr=off}} per day,{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} and contemporary methods are believed to be unchanged from ancient times.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Coca is kept in a woven pouch (''[[Chuspas|chuspa]]'' or ''huallqui''). A few leaves are chosen to form a quid ''(acullico)'' held between the mouth and gums. Doing so may cause a tingling and numbing sensation in their mouths. (The formerly ubiquitous dental anaesthetic [[procaine|novocaine / procaine]] has a similar effect.)

Chewing coca leaves is most common in indigenous communities across the central Andean region,<ref name="banrep.gov.co"/> particularly in places like the highlands of Argentina, Colombia, Bolivia and Peru, where the cultivation and consumption of coca is as much a part of the national culture, similar to [[chicha]]. It also serves as a powerful symbol of indigenous cultural and religious identity, amongst a diversity of indigenous nations throughout South America.<ref name="banrep.gov.co"/> [[Tobacco]] leaves were also traditionally chewed in the same way in North America, though modern [[chewing tobacco]] is typically heavily processed.

[[File:Llipta on coca leaf.jpeg|thumb|''llipta'' is used to improve extraction when chewing coca (Museo de la Coca, [[Cusco]], Peru)]]
One option for chewing coca is with a tiny quantity of ''ilucta'' (a preparation of the ashes of the [[quinoa]] plant) added to the coca leaves; it softens their [[astringent]] flavor and activates the [[alkaloids]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Other names for this basifying substance are ''llipta'' in Peru and the Spanish word ''lejía'', ''[[bleach]]'' in English. The consumer carefully uses a wooden stick (formerly often a spatula of precious metal) to transfer an alkaline component into the quid without touching his flesh with the corrosive substance. The alkali component, usually kept in a gourd (''ishcupuro'' or ''poporo''), can be made by burning [[limestone]] to form unslaked [[quicklime]], burning quinoa stalks, or the bark from certain trees, and may be called ''ilipta'', ''tocra'' or ''mambe'' depending on its composition.<ref name="Peterson"/><ref name="Carroll"/> Many of these materials are salty in flavor, but there are variations. The most common base{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} in the [[La Paz]] area of Bolivia is a product known as ''lejía dulce'' (''sweet lye''), which is made from quinoa ashes mixed with [[aniseed]] and cane sugar, forming a soft black putty with a sweet and pleasing flavor. In some places, [[baking soda]] is used under the name ''bico''.

In the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]], on the Caribbean Coast of Colombia, coca is consumed<ref name="banrep.gov.co"/> by the [[Kogi people|Kogi]], [[Arhuaco]] and [[Wiwa language|Wiwa]] by using a special device called [[poporo]].<ref name="banrep.gov.co"/> The poporo is the mark of manhood. It represents the womb and the stick is a phallic symbol. The movements of the stick in the poporo symbolize the sexual act. For a man the poporo is a good companion that means "food", "woman", "memory", and "meditation". It is important to stress that poporo is the symbol of manhood.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} But it is the woman who gives men their manhood. When the boy is ready to be married, his mother will initiate him in the use of the coca. This act of initiation is carefully supervised by the Mamo, a traditional priest-teacher-leader.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Although coca leaf chewing is common only among the indigenous populations,<ref name="ReferenceB"/> the consumption of coca tea (''[[Mate de coca]]'') is common among all sectors of society in the Andean countries, especially due to their high elevations from sea level,<ref name="ReferenceB"/> and is widely held to be beneficial to health, mood, and energy.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> Coca leaf is sold packaged into teabags in most grocery stores in the region, and establishments that cater to tourists generally feature coca tea.

Coca is used industrially in the cosmetics and food industries. A decocainized extract of coca leaf is one of the flavoring ingredients in [[Coca-Cola]]. Before the criminalization of cocaine, however, the extract was not decocainized. Therefore, Coca-Cola's original formula did include cocaine.<ref name="NewYorkTimesMayCliffordD1"/><ref>Benson, Drew.

=== New markets ===
Beginning in the early 21st century, there has been a movement in Bolivia, Peru,<ref>Dean, Bartholomew 2013"Cocaine Capitalisms & Social Trauma in Peruvian Amazonia", Panoramas, University of Pittsburgh (July 17) [http://www.panoramas.pitt.edu/content/cocaine-capitalisms-social-trauma-peruvian-amazonia]</ref> and Venezuela to promote and expand legal markets for the crop. The presidents of these three countries have personally identified with this movement. In particular, [[Evo Morales]] of Bolivia (elected in December 2005) was a coca grower's union leader. Morales asserts that "''la coca no es cocaína''"—the coca leaf is not cocaine. During his speech to the [[General Assembly of the United Nations]] on September 19, 2006, he held a coca leaf in his hand to demonstrate its innocuity.<ref>[http://webcast.un.org/ramgen/ga/61/ga060919pm.rm Statement of Evo Morales Aima], President of Bolivia at the 61st session of the United Nations General Assembly, September 19, 2006</ref>

[[Alan García]], president of Peru, has recommended its use in salads and other edible preparations. A Peruvian-based company has announced plans to market a modern version of [[Vin Mariani]], which will be available in both natural and de-cocainized varieties.

In Venezuela, former president [[Hugo Chávez]] said in a speech on January 2008 that he chews coca every day, and that his "hook up" is Bolivian president Evo Morales. Chávez reportedly said "I chew coca every day in the morning... and look how I am" before showing his [[biceps]] to his audience, the [[Venezuelan National Assembly]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

On the other hand, the Colombian government has recently moved in the opposite direction. For years, [[Bogotá]] has allowed indigenous coca farmers to sell coca products, promoting the enterprise as one of the few successful commercial opportunities available to recognized tribes like the [[Paez people|Nasa]], who have grown it for years and regard it as sacred.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7280906.stm Bolivia and Peru Defend Coca Use] March 6, 2008. "The United Nations lacks respect for the indigenous people of Peru and Bolivia who have used the coca leaf since forever," said Peruvian Congresswoman Maria Sumire. "For indigenous people, coca is a sacred leaf that is part of their cultural identity," she said.</ref> In December 2005, the Paeces – a Tierradentro ([[Choco language|Cauca]]) indigenous community – started to produce a carbonated soft drink called "[[Coca Sek]]".

== International prohibition of coca leaf ==
Coca leaf is the raw material for the manufacture of the [[psychoactive drug|drug]] cocaine, a powerful stimulant and [[anaesthetic]] extracted chemically from large quantities of coca leaves. Today, since it has mostly been replaced as a medical anaesthetic by synthetic analogues such as [[procaine]], cocaine is best known as an illegal [[recreational drug]]. The cultivation, sale, and possession of unprocessed coca leaf (but not of any processed form of cocaine) is generally legal in the countries – such as Bolivia, Peru, Chile and Argentina – where traditional use is established, although cultivation is often restricted in an attempt to prevent the production of cocaine. In the case of Argentina, it is legal only in some northern provinces where the practice is so common that the state has accepted it.

The prohibition of the use of the coca leaf except for medical or scientific purposes was established by the United Nations in the 1961 [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]]. The coca leaf is listed on [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Schedules of drugs|Schedule I]] of the 1961 Single Convention together with cocaine and heroin. The Convention determined that "The Parties shall so far as possible enforce the uprooting of all coca bushes which grow wild. They shall destroy the coca bushes if illegally cultivated" (Article 26), and that, "Coca leaf chewing must be abolished within twenty-five years from the coming into force of this Convention" (Article 49, 2.e).<ref name=single>[http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/conv/convention_1961_en.pdf Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]</ref>

The historic rationale for international prohibition of coca leaf in the 1961 Single Convention comes from "The Commission of Enquiry on the Coca Leaf study" published in 1950. It was requested of the United Nations by the permanent representative of Peru, and was prepared by a commission that visited Bolivia and Peru briefly in 1949 to "investigate the effects of chewing the coca leaf and the possibilities of limiting its production and controlling its distribution." It concluded that the effects of chewing coca leaves were negative, even though chewing coca was defined as a habit, not an addiction.<ref name=com>[https://www.tni.org/en/issues/unscheduling-the-coca-leaf/item/995-report-of-the-commission-of-enquiry-on-the-coca-leaf Commission of Enquiry on the Coca Leaf], UNGASS 10-year review website, Transnational Institute</ref><ref name=bul>[http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1949-01-01_1_page006.html The Commission of Enquiry on the Coca Leaf], Bulletin on Narcotics – 1949 Issue 1</ref>

The report was sharply criticised for its arbitrariness, lack of precision and racist connotations.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> The team members' professional qualifications and parallel interests were also criticised, as were the methodology used and the incomplete selection and use of existing scientific literature on the coca leaf. Questions have been raised as to whether a similar study today would pass the scrutiny and critical review to which scientific studies are routinely subjected.<ref name=cocayes>[https://www.tni.org/en/issues/unscheduling-the-coca-leaf/item/689-coca-yes-cocaine-no Coca Yes, Cocaine No? Legal Options for the Coca Leaf], Transnational Institute, Drugs & Conflict Debate Paper 13, May 2006</ref>

Despite the legal restriction among countries party to the international treaty, coca chewing and drinking of coca tea is carried out daily by millions of people in the Andes as well as considered sacred within indigenous cultures. Coca consumers claim that most of the information provided about the traditional use of the coca leaf and its modern adaptations are erroneous.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> This has made it impossible to shed light on the plant's positive aspects and its potential benefits for the physical, mental and social health of the people who consume and cultivate it.<ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref name=cocayes/>

In an attempt to obtain international acceptance for the legal recognition of traditional use of coca in their respective countries, Peru and Bolivia successfully led an amendment, paragraph 2 of Article 14 into the 1988 [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]], stipulating that measures to eradicate illicit cultivation and to eliminate illicit demand "should take due account of traditional licit use, where there is historic evidence of such use."<ref name=ambi>[https://www.tni.org/en/issues/unscheduling-the-coca-leaf/item/1005-the-resolution-of-ambiguities-regarding-coca The resolution of ambiguities regarding coca], Transnational Institute, March 2008</ref> Bolivia also made a formal reservation to the 1988 Convention, which required countries to adopt measures to establish the use, consumption, possession, purchase or cultivation of the coca leaf for personal consumption as a criminal offence. Bolivia stated that "the coca leaf is not, in and of itself, a narcotic drug or psychotropic substance" and stressed that its "legal system recognizes the ancestral nature of the licit use of the coca leaf, which, for much of Bolivia's population, dates back over centuries."<ref name=ambi/><ref>[http://untreaty.un.org/ENGLISH/bible/englishinternetbible/partI/chapterVI/treaty25.asp Status of treaty adherence], United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances</ref>

However, the [[International Narcotics Control Board]] (INCB) – the independent and [[quasi-judicial]] control organ for the implementation of the United Nations drug conventions – denied the validity of article 14 in the 1988 Convention over the requirements of the 1961 Convention, or any reservation made by parties, since it does not "absolve a party of its rights and obligations under the other international drug control treaties."<ref>[http://www.incb.org/pdf/annual-report/2007/en/annual-report-2007.pdf Report of the International Narcotics Control Board for 2007], paragraph 220</ref>

The INCB stated in its 1994 Annual Report that "mate de coca, which is considered harmless and legal in several countries in South America, is an illegal activity under the provisions of both the 1961 Convention and the 1988 Convention, though that was not the intention of the plenipotentiary conferences that adopted those conventions."<ref>[http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/ar/incb_report_1994_supplement_en_3.pdf Evaluation of the effectiveness of the international drug control treaties], Supplement to the INCB Annual Report for 1994 (Part 3)</ref> It implicitly also dismissed the original report of the Commission of Enquiry on the Coca Leaf by recognizing that "there is a need to undertake a scientific review to assess the coca-chewing habit and the drinking of coca tea."<ref>[http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/ar/incb_report_1994_supplement_en_1.pdf Evaluation of the effectiveness of the international drug control treaties], Supplement to the INCB Annual Report for 1994 (Part 1)</ref>

Nevertheless, the INCB on other occasions did not show signs of an increased sensitivity towards the Bolivian claim on the rights of their indigenous population, and the general public, to consume the coca leaf in a traditional manner by chewing the leaf, and drinking coca tea, as "not in line with the provisions of the 1961 Convention."<ref>[http://www.incb.org/pdf/annual-report/2007/en/annual-report-2007.pdf Report of the International Narcotics Control Board for 2007], paragraph 217</ref><ref name=idpc>[http://www.idpc.info/php-bin/documents/IDPC_Response2INCB_AnnRpt07_EN.pdf Response to the 2007 Annual Report of the International Narcotics Control Board], International Drug Policy Consortium (IDPC), March 2008</ref> The Board considered Bolivia, Peru and a few other countries that allow such practises to be in breach with their treaty obligations, and insisted that "each party to the Convention should establish as a criminal offence, when committed intentionally, the possession and purchase of coca leaf for personal consumption."<ref>[http://www.incb.org/pdf/annual-report/2007/en/annual-report-2007.pdf Report of the International Narcotics Control Board for 2007], paragraph 219</ref>

In reaction to the 2007 Annual Report of the INCB, the Bolivian government announced that it would formally issue a request to the United Nations to unschedule the coca leaf of List 1 of the 1961 UN Single Convention.<ref>[http://www.undrugcontrol.info/en/issues/unscheduling-the-coca-leaf/item/2623-letter-evo-morales-to-un-secretary-general-ban-ki-moon Letter Evo Morales to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon], March 8, 2008</ref> Bolivia led a diplomatic effort to do so beginning in March 2009, but eighteen countries out of a total of 184, those 18 being listed as followed (chronologically: the United States, Sweden, United Kingdom, Latvia, Japan, Canada, France, Germany, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Denmark, Estonia, Italy, Mexico, Russian Federation, Malaysia, Singapore, and Ukraine) objected to the change before the January 2011 deadline. A single objection would have been sufficient to block the modification. The legally unnecessary step of supporting the change was taken formally by Spain, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Costa Rica.<ref>{{cite web

Since the 1980s, the countries in which coca is grown have come under political and economic pressure from the United States to restrict the cultivation of the crop in order to reduce the supply of cocaine on the international market.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

[[Wikisource:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 26: THE COCA BUSH AND COCA LEAVES|Article 26]] of the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] requires nations that allow the cultivation of coca to designate an agency to regulate said cultivation and take physical possession of the crops as soon as possible after harvest, and to destroy all coca which grows wild or is illegally cultivated. The effort to enforce these provisions, referred to as [[coca eradication]], has involved many strategies, ranging from aerial spraying of [[herbicide]]s on coca crops to assistance and incentives to encourage farmers to grow alternative crops.<ref name="Coca Myths 2009">[https://www.tni.org/en/archives/know/305 Transnational Institute – Coca Myths, 2009].</ref>

This effort has been politically controversial,<ref name="economist.com">[http://www.economist.com/node/13237193 Failed States and failed policies: how to stop the drug wars]. ''The Economist'', May 2009</ref> with proponents claiming{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} that the production of cocaine is several times the amount needed to satisfy legal demand and inferring that the vast majority of the coca crop is destined for the illegal market. As per the proclaimed view, this would not only contributes to the major social problem of drug abuse but also financially supports insurgent groups that collaborate with drug traffickers in some cocaine-producing territories. Critics of the effort claim<ref name="ReferenceB"/> that it creates hardship primarily for the coca growers, many of whom are poor and have no viable alternative way to make a living, causes environmental problems, that it is not effective in reducing the supply of cocaine, in part because cultivation can move to other areas, and that any social harm created by drug abuse is only made worse by the [[War on Drugs]].<ref name="ReferenceB"/> The environmental problems include "ecocide", where vast tracts of land and forest are sprayed with glyphosate or Roundup, with the intention of eradicating the coca plant.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> However, the incidental environmental damage is severe, because many plant species are wiped out in the process.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

Coca has been reintroduced to the United States as a flavoring agent in the herbal liqueur [[Agwa de Bolivia (liqueur)|Agwa de Bolivia]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

== Legal status ==
{{See also|Coca in Bolivia}}
The primary organization authorized to purchase coca leaves is [http://www.enaco.com.pe/ ENACO S.A.], headquartered in Peru.<ref>http://www.csdp.org/research/12_coca_drugs_and_social_protest_in_bolivia_and_peru.pdf</ref> Outside of South America, most countries' laws make no distinction between the coca leaf and any other substance containing cocaine, so the possession of coca leaf is prohibited. In South America coca leaf is illegal in both Paraguay and Brazil.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, coca leaf is legally in the same category as cocaine, both are List I drugs of the [[Opium Law]]. The Opium Law specifically mentions the leaves of the plants of the genus ''Erythroxylon''. However, the possession of living plants of the genus ''Erythroxylon'' is not actively prosecuted, even though they are legally forbidden.

===United States===
In the United States, a [[Stepan Company]] plant in [[Maywood, New Jersey]] is a registered importer of coca leaf. The company manufactures pure cocaine for medical use and also produces a cocaine-free extract of the coca leaf, which is used as a flavoring ingredient in Coca-Cola. Other companies have registrations with the DEA to import coca leaf according to 2011 Federal Register Notices for Importers,<ref>{{cite web

Analysts have noted the substantial importation of coca leaf into the USA.,<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Owl59XeknxU</ref> but the actual quantity is unknown.

===Australia===
Coca leaf is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the [[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons|Poisons Standard]] (October 2015).<ref name="Poisons Standard">Poisons Standard October 2015 https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2015L01534</ref> A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.<ref name="Poisons Standard"/>
