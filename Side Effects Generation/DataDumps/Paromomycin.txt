Paromomycin was demonstrated to be effective against [[cutaneous leishmaniasis]] in clinical studies in the [[USSR]] in the 1960s, and in trials with [[visceral leishmaniasis]] in the early 1990s.<ref name="Neal1994" />

The route of administration is [[intramuscular injection]] and [[Capsule (pharmacy)|capsule]].
Paromomycin topical cream with or without gentamicin is an effective treatment for ulcerative cutaneous leishmaniasis, according to the results of a phase-3, randomized, double-blind, parallel group–controlled trial.<ref>{{ cite journal | vauthors = Ben Salah A, Ben Messaoud N, Guedri E, Zaatour A, Ben Alaya N, Bettaieb J, Gharbi A, Belhadj Hamida N, etal | title = Topical Paromomycin with or without Gentamicin for Cutaneous Leishmaniasis | journal = N.

===Pregnancy and breastfeeding===
The medication is poorly absorbed.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sweet|first1=Richard L.|last2=Gibbs|first2=Ronald S.|title=Infectious Diseases of the Female Genital Tract|date=2009|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=9780781778152|page=364|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=wuR_ngItU5oC&pg=PA364|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107161247/https://books.google.ca/books?id=wuR_ngItU5oC&pg=PA364|archivedate=2016-11-07|df=}}</ref> The effect it may have on the baby is still unknown.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Antimicrobial Therapy|last=|first=|publisher=The Medical Letter Inc.|year=2015|isbn=978-0-9815278-8-8|location=New Rochelle, New York|pages=468}}</ref>

There is limited data regarding the safety of taking paromomycin while breastfeeding but because the drug is poorly absorbed minimal amounts of drug will be secreted in breastmilk.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/pregnancy/paromomycin.html|title=Paromomycin Use During Pregnancy|website=Drugs.com|access-date=2016-11-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110044316/https://www.drugs.com/pregnancy/paromomycin.html|archivedate=2016-11-10|df=}}</ref>

===HIV/AIDS===

There is limited evidence that paromomycin can be used in persons coinfected with HIV and ''[[Cryptosporidium]].'' A few small trials have showed a reduction in oocyst shedding after treatment with paromomycin.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases|last=Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett|first=|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|year=2015|isbn=978-1-4557-4801-3|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=3181}}</ref>

== Adverse effects ==
The most common adverse effects associated with paromomycin sulfate are abdominal cramps, diarrhea, heartburn, nausea, and vomiting. Long-term use of paromomycin increases the risk for bacterial or fungal infection. Signs of overgrowth include white patches in the oral cavities. Other less common adverse events include [[myasthenia gravis]], kidney damage, [[enterocolitis]], [[Malabsorption|malabsorption syndrome]], [[eosinophilia]], headache, hearing loss, ringing in the ear, itching, severe dizziness, and [[pancreatitis]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-5160/paromomycin-oral/details#side-effects|title=paromomycin oral : Uses, Side Effects, Interactions, Pictures, Warnings & Dosing - WebMD|newspaper=WebMD|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110172918/http://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-5160/paromomycin-oral/details#side-effects|archivedate=2016-11-10|df=}}</ref>

== Interactions ==
Paromomycin belongs to the [[aminoglycoside]] drug class and therefore are [[nephrotoxicity|toxic to the kidneys]] and [[ototoxicity|to ears]]. These toxicities are additive and are more likely to occur when used with other drugs that cause ear and kidney toxicity.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases: Edition 8|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=978-1455748013|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> Concurrent use of [[foscarnet]] increases the risk of kidney toxicity.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=|title=Micromedex|last=|first=|date=|website=www.micromedexsolutions.com|publisher=|access-date=November 6, 2016}}</ref> Concurrent use of [[Colistimethate sodium|colistimethate]] and paromomycin can cause a dangerous slowing of breathing known as [[respiratory depression]], and should be done with extreme caution if necessary.<ref name=":0" /> When used with systemic antibiotics such as paromomycin, the [[cholera vaccine]] can cause an immune response.<ref name=":0" />  Use with strong [[diuretics]], which can also harm hearing, should be avoided.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Grayson|editor1-first=M.

==Mechanism==
Paromomycin is a [[protein synthesis inhibitor]] in nonresistant cells by binding to [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S]] [[ribosomal RNA]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Vicens Q, Westhof E | title = Crystal Structure of Paromomycin Docked into the Eubacterial Ribosomal Decoding A Site | journal = Structure | year = 2001 | volume = 9 | issue = 8 | pages = 647–58 | doi = 10.1016/S0969-2126(01)00629-3 | pmid = 11587639 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212601006293 }}</ref> This broad-spectrum antibiotic soluble in water, is very similar in action to [[neomycin]].

==Pharmacokinetics==

===Absorption===

GI absorption is poor. For IM injection, the absorption is rapid. Paromomycin will reach peak plasma concentration within one hour following an IM injection.<ref name=AHFS2016/> The invitro and invivo activities parallel those of neomycin.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|date=2016-08-17|editor-last=DrugBank|title=Paromomycin|url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01421|journal=DrugBank|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110110236/http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01421|archivedate=2016-11-10|df=}}</ref> Anything that impairs GI motility or any obstructions may increase the absorption of the drug. In addition structural damage such as lesions or ulcerations will tend to increase drug absorption.<ref>Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories. Paromomycin sulfate capsules, USP prescribing information. Detroit, MI; 1997 Mar.</ref>

===Distribution===

Information not available.<ref name=":1" />

===Elimination===

Almost 100% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged via feces; and if there is any absorbed drug, it will be excreted in urine.<ref>Product Information: Humatin(R), paromomycin sulfate capsules. Parke-Davis, Division of Warner-Lambert Company, Morris Plains, NJ, 1999</ref>
