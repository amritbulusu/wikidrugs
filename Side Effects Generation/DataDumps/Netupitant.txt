'''Netupitant''' is an [[antiemitic]] drug.  In the United States, the [[combination drug]] [[netupitant/palonosetron]] (trade name ''Akynzeo'') is approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] for prevention of acute and delayed [[chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting]], including highly [[emetogenic]] chemotherapy such as with [[cisplatin]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm418375.htm | title = FDA approves Akynzeo for nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration]] | date = October 10, 2014}}</ref> In Europe, it is approved by the [[European Medicines Agency]] for the same indication.<ref name="EPAR">{{cite web|title=Akynzeo: Summary of Product Characteristics|publisher=[[European Medicines Agency]]|accessdate=12 July 2016|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Product_Information/human/003728/WC500188432.pdf}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Side effects of the combination netupitant/palonosetron are similar to palonosetron alone, so that no common side effects can be attributed to netupitant.<ref name="EPAR" />

==Interactions==
Netupitant blood plasma levels are expected to increase when combined with inhibitors of the liver enzyme [[CYP3A4]] and lowered when combined with inductors of this enzyme.<ref name="EPAR" />

Being a CYP3A4 inhibitor itself, netupitant could also increase plasma levels of pharmaceuticals that are metabolized by CYP3A4. This effect has been observed with [[dexamethasone]], the anti-cancer drugs [[docetaxel]] and [[etoposide]], and to a minor (not clinically significant) extent with [[levonorgestrel]], [[erythromycin]] and [[midazolam]].<ref name="EPAR" />

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===
Netupitant is a selective [[NK1 receptor antagonist|NK<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist]].<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Rizzi A, Campi B, Camarda V, Molinari S, Cantoreggi S, Regoli D, Pietra C, Calo G | title = In vitro and in vivo pharmacological characterization of the novel NK(1) receptor selective antagonist netupitant | journal = Peptides | date = 2012 | volume = 37| issue = 1 | pages = 86–97 | doi= 10.1016/j.peptides.2012.06.010| pmid = 22732666 }}</ref>

===Pharmacokinetics===
[[Bioavailability]] is estimated to be over 60% for orally taken netupitant. Highest blood plasma concentrations are reached five hours after application. Availability is moderately (10–20%) increased when taken after a fatty meal. Netupitant and its main metabolites (called M1 and M3) are bound to [[plasma proteins]] to more than 99%, and M2 protein binding is 97%.<ref name="EPAR" />

The substance is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent by [[CYP2D6]] and [[CYP2C9]]. The main metabolites are [[desmethyl]]-netupitant (M1), netupitant [[amine oxide|''N''-oxide]] (M2), and [[hydroxyl|hydroxy]]-netupitant (M3); all three are pharmacologically active.<ref name="EPAR" /><ref name="Spinelli">{{cite journal|pmc=4282341|year=2013|author1=Spinelli|first1=T|title=Netupitant PET imaging and ADME studies in humans|journal=The Journal of Clinical Pharmacology|volume=54|issue=1|pages=97–108|last2=Calcagnile|first2=S|last3=Giuliano|first3=C|last4=Rossi|first4=G|last5=Lanzarotti|first5=C|last6=Mair|first6=S|last7=Stevens|first7=L|last8=Nisbet|first8=I|doi=10.1002/jcph.198|pmid=24122871}}</ref>

Netupitant and its metabolites are mainly excreted via the [[faeces]].<ref name="EPAR" /> [[Biological half-life]] is 88 hours, significantly longer than that of the first NK<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist, [[aprepitant]], which has a half-life of 9 to 13 hours.<ref name="AC">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2015|language=German}}</ref>
