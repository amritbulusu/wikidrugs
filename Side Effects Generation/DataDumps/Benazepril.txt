'''Benazepril''', brand name '''Lotensin''' ([[Novartis]]), is an [[ACE inhibitor]] used primarily in treatment of [[hypertension]], [[congestive heart failure]], and [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]], and also in preventing the [[kidney|renal]] and [[retina]]l complications of [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]]. 

ACE inhibitors relax blood vessels, and decrease [[blood volume]], which lowers [[blood pressure]] and decreases oxygen demand from the [[heart]]. They inhibit [[angiotensin-converting enzyme]], which is part of the [[renin–angiotensin system|renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system]].

Benazepril is a [[prodrug]] which is metabolized by the [[liver]] into its active form ''benazeprilat'' via cleavage of the drug's [[ester]] group.

==Medical uses==

===Kidney disease===
Patients with advanced [[renal insufficiency]] taking benazepril show "substantial" kidney benefits.<ref name = Hou>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hou F, Zhang X, Zhang G, Xie D, Chen P, Zhang W, Jiang J, Liang M, Wang G, Liu Z, Geng R | title = Efficacy and safety of benazepril for advanced chronic renal insufficiency | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 354 | issue = 2 | pages = 131–40 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16407508 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa053107}}</ref> A long-term study of patients' kidney disease revealed patients who took benazepril had better [[kidney function]] and slower progressions of kidney disease than their peers who took a [[placebo]] drug.<ref name = Hitti>{{cite web |url= http://www.webmd.com/content/article/117/112524.htm |title= Drug May Treat Advanced Kidney Disease |accessdate= 2006-09-07 |last= Hitti |first= Miranda |author2=Chang, Louise |date= January 11, 2006 |publisher = [[WebMD]]}}</ref> This is notable because this category of pharmaceuticals has long been thought to cause further kidney damage or increase the rate of progression for kidney disease.

According to coverage of the study on WebMD: "[[ACE inhibitor]]s can pose a potential threat to kidneys, as well. The key question was whether damaged kidneys would worsen if patients took ACE inhibitors. In a nutshell, concerns centered on blood levels of [[potassium]] and [[creatinine]], waste products that are excreted by the kidneys. Testing creatinine levels in the blood is used as a way to monitor kidney function (...) kidney problems worsened more slowly in those taking Lotensin. Overall, there were no major differences in side effects between patients taking Lotensin or the placebo.<ref name = Hitti/>" This study marks the first indication that benazepril, and perhaps other ACE inhibitors, may actually be beneficial in the treatment of hypertension in patients with kidney disease.

==Side effects==
The most common side effects patients experience are a [[headache]] or a chronic [[cough]].  The chronic cough  develops in about 20% of patients treated,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/484537_2 |last=Dykewicz|first=Mark S.| title=Cough and Angioedema From Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors: New Insights Into Mechanisms and Management|work=Medscape|date=April 2004 |accessdate=2 April 2014}}</ref> and those patients that experience it find it develops after a few months of use.  [[Anaphylaxis]], [[angioedema]], and  [[hyperkalemia|elevation of potassium levels]] are more serious side effects that can also occur.

==Contraindications==
Benazepril should be discontinued during pregnancy, as it can harm the fetus.

==Dosage forms==
It is also available in combination with [[hydrochlorothiazide]], under the trade name Lotensin HCT', and with [[amlodipine]] (trade name Lotrel).
