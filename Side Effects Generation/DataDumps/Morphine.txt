=== Constipation ===
Like [[loperamide]] and other opioids, morphine acts on the [[myenteric plexus]] in the intestinal tract, reducing gut motility, causing constipation. The gastrointestinal effects of morphine are mediated primarily by [[mu Opioid receptor|μ-opioid receptors]] in the bowel. By inhibiting gastric emptying and reducing propulsive [[peristalsis]] of the intestine, morphine decreases the rate of intestinal transit. Reduction in gut secretion and increased intestinal fluid absorption also contribute to the constipating effect. Opioids also may act on the gut indirectly through tonic gut spasms after inhibition of [[nitric oxide]] generation.<ref name="pmid15082884">{{cite journal |vauthors=Stefano GB, Zhu W, Cadet P, Bilfinger TV, Mantione K | title = Morphine enhances nitric oxide release in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract via the micro(3) opiate receptor subtype: a hormonal role for endogenous morphine | journal = J.

=== Hormone imbalance ===
{{See also|Opioid#Hormone imbalance}}
Clinical studies consistently conclude that morphine, like other opioids, often causes [[hypogonadism]] and [[hormone imbalance]]s in chronic users of both sexes. This side effect is [[dose–response relationship|dose-dependent]] and occurs in both therapeutic and recreational users. Morphine can interfere with menstruation in women by suppressing levels of [[luteinizing hormone]]. Many studies suggest the majority (perhaps as much as 90%) of chronic opioid users have opioid-induced hypogonadism. This effect may cause the increased likelihood of [[osteoporosis]] and [[bone fracture]] observed in chronic morphine users. Studies suggest the effect is temporary. {{As of|2013}}, the effect of low-dose or acute use of morphine on the endocrine system is unclear.<ref name="pmid23414717">{{cite journal | author = Brennan MJ | title = The effect of opioid therapy on endocrine function | journal = Am.

=== Effects on human performance ===
Most reviews conclude that opioids produce minimal impairment of human performance on tests of sensory, motor, or attentional abilities. However, recent studies have been able to show some impairments caused by morphine, which is not surprising, given that morphine is a [[central nervous system]] [[depressant]]. Morphine has resulted in impaired functioning on critical flicker frequency (a measure of overall CNS arousal) and impaired performance on the [[Maddox wing]] test (a measure of deviation of the visual axes of the eyes). Few studies have investigated the effects of morphine on motor abilities; a high dose of morphine can impair finger tapping and the ability to maintain a low constant level of [[isometric exercise|isometric force]] (i.e. fine motor control is impaired),<ref name="pmid1755931">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kerr B, Hill H, Coda B, Calogero M, Chapman CR, Hunt E, Buffington V, Mackie A | title = Concentration-related effects of morphine on cognition and motor control in human subjects | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 157–66 |date=November 1991 | pmid = 1755931 | doi =  }}</ref> though no studies have shown a correlation between morphine and gross motor abilities.

In terms of [[cognitive]] abilities, one study has shown that morphine may have a negative impact on [[anterograde amnesia|anterograde]] and [[retrograde amnesia|retrograde memory]],<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Friswell J, Phillips C, Holding J, Morgan CJ, Brandner B, Curran HV |title=Acute effects of opioids on memory functions of healthy men and women |journal=Psychopharmacology |volume=198 |issue=2 |pages=243–50 |year=2008|pmid=18379759 |doi=10.1007/s00213-008-1123-x}}</ref> but these effects are minimal and transient. Overall, it seems that acute doses of opioids in non-tolerant subjects produce minor effects in some sensory and motor abilities, and perhaps also in [[attention]] and cognition. It is likely that the effects of morphine will be more pronounced in opioid-naive subjects than chronic opioid users.

In chronic opioid users, such as those on Chronic Opioid Analgesic Therapy (COAT) for managing severe, [[chronic pain]], behavioural testing has shown normal functioning on perception, cognition, coordination and behaviour in most cases. One 2000 study<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Galski T, Williams JB, Ehle HT |title=Effects of opioids on driving ability |journal=J Pain Symptom Manage |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=200–8 |year=2000 |pmid=10760625 |doi=10.1016/S0885-3924(99)00158-X}}</ref> analysed COAT patients to determine whether they were able to safely operate a motor vehicle. The findings from this study suggest that stable opioid use does not significantly impair abilities inherent in driving (this includes physical, cognitive and perceptual skills). COAT patients showed rapid completion of tasks that require speed of responding for successful performance (e.g., [[Rey Complex Figure]] Test) but made more errors than controls. COAT patients showed no deficits in visual-spatial perception and organization (as shown in the [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale|WAIS-R]] Block Design Test) but did show impaired immediate and short-term visual memory (as shown on the Rey Complex Figure Test&nbsp;– Recall). These patients showed no impairments in higher order cognitive abilities (i.e., planning). COAT patients appeared to have difficulty following instructions and showed a propensity toward impulsive behaviour, yet this did not reach statistical significance. It is important to note that this study reveals that COAT patients have no domain-specific deficits, which supports the notion that chronic opioid use has minor effects on [[Psychomotor learning|psychomotor]], [[cognitive]], or [[neuropsychological]] functioning.

==== Addiction ====

[[File:Santiago Rusinol Before the Morphine.jpg|thumb|''Before the Morphine'' by [[Santiago Rusiñol]]]]

Morphine is a highly [[addictive]] substance. In controlled studies comparing the physiological and subjective effects of [[heroin]] and morphine in individuals formerly addicted to opiates, subjects showed no preference for one drug over the other. Equipotent, injected doses had comparable action courses, with no difference in subjects' self-rated feelings of euphoria, ambition, nervousness, relaxation, drowsiness, or sleepiness.<ref name="martin and fraser" /> Short-term addiction studies by the same researchers demonstrated that tolerance developed at a similar rate to both heroin and morphine. When compared to the opioids [[hydromorphone]], [[fentanyl]], [[oxycodone]], and [[pethidine]]/[[meperidine]], former addicts showed a strong preference for heroin and morphine, suggesting that heroin and morphine are particularly susceptible to abuse and addiction. Morphine and heroin were also much more likely to produce euphoria and other positive subjective effects when compared to these other opioids.<ref name="martin and fraser" /> The choice of heroin and morphine over other opioids by former drug addicts may also be because heroin (also known as morphine diacetate, diamorphine, or diacetyl morphine) is an ester of morphine and a morphine [[prodrug]], essentially meaning they are identical drugs ''in vivo''. Heroin is converted to morphine before binding to the [[opioid receptor]]s in the brain and spinal cord, where morphine causes the subjective effects, which is what the addicted individuals are seeking.<ref name="urlDrugFacts: Heroin | National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)">{{cite web | url = http://www.nida.nih.gov/infofacts/heroin.html | title = Heroin | author = National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) | date = April 2013 | work = DrugFacts | publisher = U.S. National Institutes of Health | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051130022758/http://www.nida.nih.gov/Infofacts/heroin.html | archivedate = 30 November 2005 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

==== Tolerance ====
Several hypotheses are given about how tolerance develops, including opioid receptor [[phosphorylation]] (which would change the receptor conformation), functional decoupling of receptors from [[G-proteins]] (leading to receptor desensitization),<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Roshanpour M, Ghasemi M, Riazi K, Rafiei-Tabatabaei N, Ghahremani MH, Dehpour AR |title=Tolerance to the anticonvulsant effect of morphine in mice: blockage by ultra-low dose naltrexone |journal=Epilepsy Res. |volume=83 |issue=2–3 |pages=261–4 |year=2009|pmid=19059761 |doi=10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2008.10.011}}</ref> μ-opioid receptor internalization or receptor down-regulation (reducing the number of available receptors for morphine to act on), and upregulation of the [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] pathway (a counterregulatory mechanism to opioid effects) (For a review of these processes, see Koch and Hollt.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Koch T, Höllt V |title=Role of receptor internalization in opioid tolerance and dependence |journal=Pharmacol.

CCK-antagonist drugs, specifically [[proglumide]], have been shown to slow the development of tolerance to morphine.

==== Dependence and withdrawal ====
{{See also|Opioid dependence|Opioid withdrawal}}
Cessation of dosing with morphine creates the prototypical opioid withdrawal syndrome, which, unlike that of [[barbiturates]], [[benzodiazepines]], [[ethanol|alcohol]], or sedative-hypnotics, is not fatal by itself in neurologically healthy patients without heart or lung problems.

Acute morphine withdrawal, along with that of any other opioid, proceeds through a number of stages. Other opioids differ in the intensity and length of each, and weak opioids and mixed agonist-antagonists may have acute withdrawal syndromes that do not reach the highest level. As commonly cited{{by whom|date=November 2010}}, they are:
* '''Stage I''', 6&nbsp;h to 14&nbsp;h after last dose: Drug craving, anxiety, irritability, perspiration, and mild to moderate [[dysphoria]] {{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}
* '''Stage II''', 14&nbsp;h to 18&nbsp;h after last dose: Yawning, heavy perspiration, mild depression, lacrimation, crying, headaches, runny nose, [[dysphoria]], also intensification of the above symptoms, "yen sleep" (a waking trance-like state) {{clarify|date=October 2010}}
* '''Stage III''', 16&nbsp;h to 24&nbsp;h after last dose: [[Rhinorrhea]] (runny nose) and increase in other of the above, dilated pupils, piloerection (goose bumps – a purported origin of the phrase, 'cold turkey,' but in fact the phrase originated outside of drug treatment),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/why-do-we-quit-cold-turkey |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121175014/http://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/why-do-we-quit-cold-turkey |archivedate=21 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> muscle twitches, hot flashes, cold flashes, aching bones and muscles, loss of appetite, and the beginning of intestinal cramping {{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}
* '''Stage IV''', 24&nbsp;h to 36&nbsp;h after last dose: Increase in all of the above including severe cramping and involuntary leg movements ("kicking the habit" also called [[restless leg syndrome]]), loose stool, insomnia, elevation of blood pressure, moderate elevation in body temperature, increase in frequency of breathing and tidal volume, [[tachycardia]] (elevated pulse), restlessness, nausea {{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}
* '''Stage V''', 36&nbsp;h to 72&nbsp;h after last dose: Increase in the above, fetal position, vomiting, free and frequent liquid diarrhea, which sometimes can accelerate the time of passage of food from mouth to out of system, weight loss of 2&nbsp;kg to 5&nbsp;kg per 24&nbsp;h, increased [[White blood cell|white cell count]], and other blood changes {{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}
* '''Stage VI''', after completion of above: Recovery of appetite and normal bowel function, beginning of transition to postacute and chronic symptoms that are mainly psychological, but may also include increased sensitivity to pain, hypertension, [[colitis]] or other gastrointestinal afflictions related to motility, and problems with weight control in either direction {{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In advanced stages of withdrawal, ultrasonographic evidence of pancreatitis has been demonstrated in some patients and is presumably attributed to spasm of the pancreatic [[sphincter of Oddi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/68215-opiate-withdrawal-stages/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605063405/http://www.livestrong.com/article/68215-opiate-withdrawal-stages/ |archivedate=5 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The withdrawal symptoms associated with morphine addiction are usually experienced shortly before the time of the next scheduled dose, sometimes within as early as a few hours (usually 6&nbsp;h to 12&nbsp;h) after the last administration. Early symptoms include watery eyes, insomnia, diarrhea, runny nose, yawning, [[dysphoria]], sweating, and in some cases a strong drug craving. Severe headache, restlessness, irritability, loss of appetite, body aches, severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, tremors, and even stronger and more intense drug craving appear as the syndrome progresses. Severe depression and vomiting are very common. During the acute withdrawal period, systolic and diastolic blood pressures increase, usually beyond premorphine levels, and heart rate increases,<ref name="Chan, Irvine, and White">{{cite journal |vauthors=Chan R, Irvine R, White J |title=Cardiovascular changes during morphine administration and spontaneous withdrawal in the rat |journal=Eur.

Chills or cold flashes with goose bumps ("[[cold turkey]]") alternating with flushing (hot flashes), kicking movements of the legs ("kicking the habit"<ref name="urlDrugFacts: Heroin | National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)" />) and excessive sweating are also characteristic symptoms.<ref name="urlDrugs and Human Performance FACT SHEETS – Morphine (and Heroin)">{{cite web | url = http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/People/injury/research/job185drugs/morphine.htm | title = Morphine (and Heroin) | date =  | work = Drugs and Human Performance Fact Sheets | publisher = U.S. National Traffic Safety Administration | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061003085645/http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/injury/research/job185drugs/morphine.htm | archivedate = 3 October 2006 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Severe pains in the bones and muscles of the back and extremities occur, as do muscle spasms. At any point during this process, a suitable narcotic can be administered that will dramatically reverse the withdrawal symptoms. Major withdrawal symptoms peak between 48&nbsp;h and 96&nbsp;h after the last dose and subside after about 8 to 12 days. Sudden withdrawal by heavily dependent users who are in poor health is very rarely fatal.

The psychological dependence associated with morphine [[Substance use disorder|addiction]] is complex and protracted. Long after the physical need for morphine has passed, the addict will usually continue to think and talk about the use of morphine (or other drugs) and feel strange or overwhelmed coping with daily activities without being under the influence of morphine. Psychological withdrawal from morphine is usually a very long and painful process.<ref name="pmid11594449">{{cite journal |vauthors=Anraku T, Ikegaya Y, Matsuki N, Nishiyama N | title = Withdrawal from chronic morphine administration causes prolonged enhancement of immobility in rat forced swimming test | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 157 | issue = 2 | pages = 217–20 |date=September 2001 | pmid = 11594449 | doi = 10.1007/s002130100793 }}</ref>{{Unreliable medical source|date=January 2014|sure=y}} Addicts often suffer severe depression, anxiety, insomnia, mood swings, amnesia (forgetfulness), low self-esteem, confusion, paranoia, and other psychological disorders. Without intervention, the syndrome will run its course, and most of the overt physical symptoms will disappear within 7 to 10 days including psychological dependence. A high probability of relapse exists after morphine withdrawal when neither the physical environment nor the behavioral motivators that contributed to the abuse have been altered. Testimony to morphine's addictive and reinforcing nature is its relapse rate. Abusers of morphine (and heroin) have one of the highest relapse rates among all drug users, ranging up to 98% in the estimation of some medical experts.<ref>{{Cite book  | author = O'Neil MJ | title = The Merck index : an encyclopedia of chemicals, drugs, and biological | year = 2006 | publisher = Merck | location = Whitehouse Station, N.J. | isbn = 0-911910-00-X | pages = }}</ref>

{{Main article|Opioid receptor}}
{{Update|section|inaccurate=yes|date=July 2014}}
Endogenous opioids include [[endorphin]]s, [[enkephalin]]s, [[dynorphin]]s, and even morphine itself. Morphine appears to mimic endorphins. Endorphins, a contraction of the term endogenous morphines, are responsible for [[analgesia]] (reducing pain), causing sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure. They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or excitement.

Morphine is the prototypical opioid and is the standard against which other opioids are tested.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ogura|first1=Takahiro|last2=Egan|first2=Talmage D.|title=Pharmacology and physiology for anesthesia : foundations and clinical application|date=2013|publisher=Elsevier/Saunders|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-1-4377-1679-5|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781437716795000156|chapter=Chapter 15 – Opioid Agonists and Antagonists}}</ref> It interacts predominantly with the μ–δ-opioid (Mu-Delta) [[GPCR oligomer|receptor heteromer]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yekkirala AS, Kalyuzhny AE, Portoghese PS |title=Standard opioid agonists activate heteromeric opioid receptors: evidence for morphine and [d-Ala(2)-MePhe(4)-Glyol(5)]enkephalin as selective μ-δ agonists |journal=ACS Chem Neurosci |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=146–54 |year=2010 |pmid=22816017 |doi=10.1021/cn9000236 |url= |pmc=3398540}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yekkirala AS, Banks ML, Lunzer MM, Negus SS, Rice KC, Portoghese PS |title=Clinically employed opioid analgesics produce antinociception via μ-δ opioid receptor heteromers in Rhesus monkeys |journal=ACS Chem Neurosci |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=720–7 |year=2012 |pmid=23019498 |pmc=3447399 |doi=10.1021/cn300049m |url=}}</ref> The μ-binding sites are discretely distributed in the [[human brain]], with high densities in the posterior [[amygdala]], [[hypothalamus]], [[thalamus]], [[nucleus caudatus]], [[putamen]], and certain cortical areas.

Morphine is a [[phenanthrene]] [[opioid receptor]] [[receptor agonist|agonist]]&nbsp;– its main effect is binding to and activating the [[mu opioid receptor|μ-opioid]] receptors in the [[central nervous system]]. Its [[intrinsic activity]] at the μ-opioid is heavily dependent on the [[assay]] and tissue being tested; in some situations it is a [[full agonist]] while in others it can be a [[partial agonist]] or even [[antagonist]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kelly|first1=E|title=Efficacy and ligand bias at the μ-opioid receptor.|journal=British Journal of Pharmacology|date=August 2013|volume=169|issue=7|pages=1430–46|doi=10.1111/bph.12222|pmid=23646826|pmc=3724102}}</ref> In clinical settings, morphine exerts its principal pharmacological effect on the central nervous system and [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]]. Its primary actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation. Activation of the [[mu opioid receptor|μ-opioid]] receptors is associated with analgesia, sedation, [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]], physical [[Chemical dependency|dependence]], and [[respiratory depression]]. Morphine is also a [[kappa opioid receptor|κ-opioid]] and [[delta opioid receptor|δ-opioid]] receptor agonist, κ-opioid's action is associated with spinal analgesia, [[miosis]] (pinpoint pupils) and [[psychotomimetic]] effects. δ-Opioid is thought to play a role in analgesia.<ref name="rxlist.com" /> Although morphine does not bind to the [[sigma receptor|σ-receptor]], it has been shown that σ-agonists, such as (+)-[[pentazocine]], inhibit morphine analgesia, and σ-antagonists enhance morphine analgesia,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chien CC, Pasternak GW |title=Sigma antagonists potentiate opioid analgesia in rats |journal=Neurosci.

The effects of morphine can be countered with opioid [[receptor antagonist|antagonists]] such as [[naloxone]] and [[naltrexone]]; the development of tolerance to morphine may be inhibited by [[NMDA]] antagonists such as [[ketamine]] or [[dextromethorphan]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Herman BH, Vocci F, Bridge P |title=The effects of NMDA receptor antagonists and nitric oxide synthase inhibitors on opioid tolerance and withdrawal.

It is believed that the strong opioid with the most incomplete cross-tolerance with morphine is either methadone or [[dextromoramide]].

==== Gene expression ====
Studies have shown that morphine can alter the expression of a number of [[genes]]. A single injection of morphine has been shown to alter the expression of two major groups of genes, for proteins involved in [[mitochondria]]l respiration and for [[cytoskeleton]]-related proteins.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Loguinov A, Anderson L, Crosby G, Yukhananov R |title=Gene expression following acute morphine administration |journal=Physiol Genomics |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=169–81 |year=2001 |pmid=11526201}}</ref>

==== Effects on the immune system ====
Morphine has long been known to act on receptors expressed on cells of the [[central nervous system]] resulting in pain relief and [[analgesia]]. In the 1970s and '80s, evidence suggesting that opioid drug addicts show increased risk of infection (such as increased [[pneumonia]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[HIV/AIDS]]) led scientists to believe that morphine may also affect the [[immune system]]. This possibility increased interest in the effect of chronic morphine use on the immune system.

The first step of determining that morphine may affect the immune system was to establish that the opiate receptors known to be expressed on cells of the central nervous system are also expressed on cells of the immune system. One study successfully showed that [[dendritic cells]], part of the innate immune system, display opiate receptors. Dendritic cells are responsible for producing [[cytokine]]s, which are the tools for communication in the immune system. This same study showed that dendritic cells chronically treated with morphine during their differentiation produce more [[interleukin-12]] (IL-12), a cytokine responsible for promoting the proliferation, growth, and differentiation of T-cells (another cell of the adaptive immune system) and less [[interleukin-10]] (IL-10), a cytokine responsible for promoting a B-cell immune response (B cells produce antibodies to fight off infection).<ref name="messmer 2006">{{cite journal |vauthors=Messmer D, Hatsukari I, Hitosugi N, Schmidt-Wolf IG, Singhal PC |title=Morphine reciprocally regulates IL-10 and IL-12 production by monocyte-derived human dendritic cells and enhances T cell activation |journal=Mol. Med. |volume=12 |issue=11–12 |pages=284–90 |year=2006 |pmid=17380193 |pmc=1829197 |doi=10.2119/2006-00043.Messmer}}</ref>

This regulation of cytokines appear to occur via the [[p38 MAPK pathway|p38 MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinase)-dependent pathway]]. Usually, the p38 within the dendritic cell expresses [[TLR 4]] (toll-like receptor 4), which is activated through the ligand LPS ([[lipopolysaccharide]]). This causes the p38 MAPK to be [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]]. This phosphorylation activates the [[p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases|p38 MAPK]] to begin producing IL-10 and IL-12. When the dendritic cells are chronically exposed to morphine during their differentiation process then treated with LPS, the production of cytokines is different. Once treated with morphine, the p38 MAPK does not produce IL-10, instead favoring production of IL-12. The exact mechanism through which the production of one cytokine is increased in favor over another is not known. Most likely, the morphine causes increased phosphorylation of the p38 MAPK. Transcriptional level interactions between IL-10 and IL-12 may further increase the production of IL-12 once IL-10 is not being produced. This increased production of IL-12 causes increased T-cell immune response.

Further studies on the effects of morphine on the immune system have shown that morphine influences the production of [[neutrophils]] and other [[cytokines]]. Since cytokines are produced as part of the immediate immunological response ([[inflammation]]), it has been suggested that they may also influence pain. In this way, cytokines may be a logical target for analgesic development. Recently, one study has used an animal model (hind-paw incision) to observe the effects of morphine administration on the acute immunological response. Following hind-paw incision, pain thresholds and cytokine production were measured. Normally, cytokine production in and around the wounded area increases in order to fight [[infection]] and control healing (and, possibly, to control pain), but pre-incisional morphine administration (0.1&nbsp;mg/kg to 10.0&nbsp;mg/kg) reduced the number of cytokines found around the wound in a dose-dependent manner. The authors suggest that morphine administration in the acute post-injury period may reduce resistance to infection and may impair the healing of the wound.<ref name="pmid17908329">{{cite journal |vauthors=Clark JD, Shi X, Li X, Qiao Y, Liang D, Angst MS, Yeomans DC | title = Morphine reduces local cytokine expression and neutrophil infiltration after incision | journal = Mol Pain | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 28 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17908329 | pmc = 2096620 | doi = 10.1186/1744-8069-3-28 }}</ref>

=== Pharmacokinetics ===

==== Absorption and metabolism ====
Morphine can be taken [[oral administration|orally]], [[Sublingual administration|sublingually]], [[Buccal space|bucally]], [[rectal administration|rectally]], [[subcutaneous injection|subcutaneously]], [[Insufflation (medicine)|intranasally]], [[intravenous]]ly, [[intrathecal]]ly or [[epidural]]ly and inhaled via a nebulizer. As a recreational drug, it is becoming more common to inhale ("[[Chasing the Dragon]]"), but, for medical purposes, intravenous (IV) injection is the most common method of administration. Morphine is subject to extensive [[first-pass metabolism]] (a large proportion is broken down in the liver), so, if taken orally, only 40% to 50% of the dose reaches the central nervous system. Resultant plasma levels after subcutaneous (SC), intramuscular (IM), and IV injection are all comparable.

==== Detection in body fluids ====
Morphine and its major metabolites, morphine-3-glucuronide and morphine-6-glucuronide, can be detected in blood, plasma, hair, and urine using an [[immunoassay]]. [[Chromatography]] can be used to test for each of these substances individually. Some testing procedures [[hydrolysis|hydrolyze]] metabolic products into morphine before the immunoassay, which must be considered when comparing morphine levels in separately published results. Morphine can also be isolated from whole blood samples by [[solid phase extraction]] (SPE) and detected using [[liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry]] (LC-MS).

[[File:Morphine stereo structure.svg|thumb|Same structure with correct 3D configuration; backbone in blue.]]

Morphine is a [[benzylisoquinoline]] alkaloid with two additional ring closures. It has:
* A rigid [[pentacyclic]] structure consisting of a [[benzene]] ring (A), two partially unsaturated [[cyclohexane]] rings (B and C), a [[piperidine]] ring (D) and a [[tetrahydrofuran]] ring (E). Rings A, B and C are the [[phenanthrene]] ring system. This ring system has little conformational flexibility.
* Two hydroxyl functional groups: a C3-[[phenol]]ic OH (p''K''<sub>a</sub> 9.9) and a C6-[[allyl]]ic [[hydroxyl|OH]],
* An [[ether]] linkage between C4 and C5,
* [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|Unsaturation]] between C7 and C8,
* A basic, tertiary [[amine]] function at position 17,
* 5 centers of [[chirality]] (C5, C6, C9, C13 and C14) with morphine exhibiting a high degree of [[stereoselectivity]] of analgesic action.<ref name="urlwww.auburn.edu">{{cite web | url = http://www.auburn.edu/~deruija/opioids_morphine.pdf | title = Narcotic analgesics: morphine and "peripherally modified" morphine analogs | author = DeRuiter J | date = Fall 2000 | format = PDF | work = Principles of Drug Action 2 | publisher = Auburn University | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120111171903/http://www.auburn.edu/~deruija/opioids_morphine.pdf | archivedate = 11 January 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

Most of the licit morphine produced is used to make [[codeine]] by methylation. It is also a precursor for many drugs including [[heroin]] (3,6-diacetylmorphine), [[hydromorphone]] (dihydromorphinone), and [[oxymorphone]] (14-hydroxydihydromorphinone); many morphine derivatives can also be manufactured using [[thebaine]] or codeine as a starting material. Replacement of the ''N''-methyl group of morphine with an ''N''-phenylethyl group results in a product that is 18 times more powerful than morphine in its opiate agonist potency. Combining this modification with the replacement of the 6-[[hydroxyl]] with a 6-[[methylene group]] produces a compound some 1,443 times more potent than morphine, stronger than the [[Bentley compounds]] such as [[etorphine]] (M99, the Immobilon tranquilliser dart) by some measures.

The structure-activity relationship of morphine has been extensively studied. As a result of the extensive study and use of this molecule, more than 250 morphine derivatives (also counting codeine and related drugs) have been developed since the last quarter of the 19th century. These drugs range from 25% the analgesic strength of codeine (or slightly more than 2% of the strength of morphine) to several thousand times the strength of morphine, to powerful opioid antagonists, including [[naloxone]] (Narcan), [[naltrexone]] (Trexan), [[diprenorphine]] (M5050, the reversing agent for the Immobilon dart) and [[nalorphine]] (Nalline). Some opioid agonist-antagonists, partial agonists, and inverse agonists are also derived from morphine. The receptor-activation profile of the semi-synthetic morphine derivatives varies widely and some, like [[apomorphine]] are devoid of narcotic effects.

Morphine and most of its derivatives do not exhibit optical isomerism, although some more distant relatives like the morphinan series (levorphanol, dextorphan and the racemic parent chemical dromoran) do, and as noted above stereoselectivity in vivo is an important issue.

Morphine-derived [[agonist–antagonist]] drugs have also been developed. Elements of the morphine structure have been used to create completely synthetic drugs such as the [[morphinan]] family ([[levorphanol]], [[dextromethorphan]] and others) and other groups that have many members with morphine-like qualities. The modification of morphine and the aforementioned synthetics has also given rise to non-narcotic drugs with other uses such as emetics, stimulants, antitussives, anticholinergics, muscle relaxants, local anaesthetics, general anaesthetics, and others.

Most semi-synthetic opioids, both of the morphine and [[codeine]] subgroups, are created by modifying one or more of the following:
* Halogenating or making other modifications at positions 1 or 2 on the morphine carbon skeleton.
* The methyl group that makes morphine into codeine can be removed or added back, or replaced with another functional group like ethyl and others to make codeine analogues of morphine-derived drugs and vice versa. Codeine analogues of morphine-based drugs often serve as prodrugs of the stronger drug, as in codeine and morphine, hydrocodone and hydromorphone, oxycodone and oxymorphone, nicocodeine and nicomorphine, dihydrocodeine and dihydromorphine, etc.
* Saturating, opening, or other changes to the bond between positions 7 and 8, as well as adding, removing, or modifying functional groups to these positions; saturating, reducing, eliminating, or otherwise modifying the 7–8 bond and attaching a functional group at 14 yields [[hydromorphinol]]; the oxidation of the hydroxyl group to a carbonyl and changing the 7–8 bond to single from double changes codeine into oxycodone.
* Attachment, removal or modification of functional groups to positions 3 or 6 (dihydrocodeine and related, hydrocodone, nicomorphine); in the case of moving the methyl functional group from position 3 to 6, codeine becomes [[heterocodeine]], which is 72 times stronger, and therefore six times stronger than morphine
* Attachment of functional groups or other modification at position 14 (oxymorphone, oxycodone, naloxone)
* Modifications at positions 2, 4, 5 or 17, usually along with other changes to the molecule elsewhere on the morphine skeleton. Often this is done with drugs produced by catalytic reduction, hydrogenation, oxidation, or the like, producing strong derivatives of morphine and codeine.

In five liters of water, only one gram of the hydrate will dissolve. For this reason, pharmaceutical companies produce sulfate and hydrochloride salts of the drug, both of which are over 300 times more water-soluble than their parent molecule. Whereas the pH of a saturated morphine hydrate solution is 8.5, the salts are acidic. Since they derive from a strong acid but weak base, they are both at about pH = 5; as a consequence, the morphine salts are mixed with small amounts of [[Sodium hydroxide|NaOH]] to make them suitable for injection.<ref name="urlMorphine">{{cite web | url = http://www.emsb.qc.ca/laurenhill/science/morphine.html | title = Morphine | date =  | work = LHA Science Page | publisher = LaurenHill Academy | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050215094332/http://www.emsb.qc.ca/laurenhill/science/morphine.html | archivedate = 15 February 2005 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

A number of salts of morphine are used, with the most common in current clinical use being the hydrochloride, sulfate, tartrate, and citrate; less commonly methobromide, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, lactate, chloride, and bitartrate and the others listed below. Morphine diacetate, which is another name for heroin, is a Schedule I controlled substance, so it is not used clinically in the United States; it is a sanctioned medication in the [[United Kingdom]] and in [[Canada]] and some countries in Continental Europe, its use being particularly common (nearly to the degree of the hydrochloride salt) in the United Kingdom. Morphine meconate is a major form of the alkaloid in the poppy, as is morphine pectinate, nitrate, sulphate, and some others. Like codeine, dihydrocodeine and other (especially older) opiates, morphine has been used as the salicylate salt by some suppliers and can be easily compounded, imparting the therapeutic advantage of both the opioid and the [[NSAID]]; multiple [[barbiturate]] salts of morphine were also used in the past, as was/is morphine valerate, the salt of the acid being the active principle of [[valerian (herb)|valerian]]. [[Calcium morphenate]] is the intermediate in various latex and poppy-straw methods of morphine production, more rarely sodium morphenate takes its place. Morphine ascorbate and other salts such as the tannate, citrate, and acetate, phosphate, valerate and others may be present in poppy tea depending on the method of preparation. Morphine valerate produced industrially was one ingredient of a medication available for both oral and parenteral administration popular many years ago in Europe and elsewhere called Trivalin (not to be confused with the current, unrelated herbal preparation of the same name), which also included the valerates of [[caffeine]] and [[cocaine]], with a version containing codeine valerate as a fourth ingredient being distributed under the name Tetravalin.

Closely related to morphine are the opioids morphine-''N''-oxide (genomorphine), which is a pharmaceutical that is no longer in common use; and pseudomorphine, an alkaloid that exists in opium, form as degradation products of morphine.

== Production ==
[[File:Alkaloids.png|thumb|First generation production of alkaloids from licit latex-derived opium]]
In the [[opium poppy]], the alkaloids are bound to [[meconic acid]]. The method is to extract from the crushed plant with diluted sulfuric acid, which is a stronger acid than meconic acid, but not so strong to react with alkaloid molecules. The [[Extraction (chemistry)|extraction]] is performed in many steps (one amount of crushed plant is extracted at least six to ten times, so practically every [[alkaloid]] goes into the solution). From the solution obtained at the last extraction step, the alkaloids are precipitated by either ammonium hydroxide or sodium carbonate. The last step is purifying and separating morphine from other opium alkaloids. The somewhat similar Gregory process was developed in the United Kingdom during the Second World War, which begins with stewing the entire plant, in most cases save the roots and leaves, in plain or mildly acidified water, then proceeding through steps of concentration, extraction, and purification of alkaloids.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Other methods of processing "poppy straw" (i.e., dried pods and stalks) use steam, one or more of several types of alcohol, or other organic solvents.

The poppy straw methods predominate in Continental Europe and the British Commonwealth, with the latex method in most common use in India. The latex method can involve either vertical or horizontal slicing of the unripe pods with a two-to five-bladed knife with a guard developed specifically for this purpose to the depth of a fraction of a millimetre and scoring of the pods can be done up to five times. An alternative latex method sometimes used in China in the past is to cut off the poppy heads, run a large needle through them, and collect the dried latex 24 to 48 hours later.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In India, opium harvested by licensed poppy farmers is dehydrated to uniform levels of hydration at government processing centers, and then sold to pharmaceutical companies that extract morphine from the opium. However, in Turkey and Tasmania, morphine is obtained by harvesting and processing the fully mature dry seed pods with attached stalks, called ''poppy straw''.  In Turkey, a water extraction process is used, while in Tasmania, a solvent extraction process is used.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Opium poppy contains at least 50 different alkaloids, but most of them are of very low concentration. Morphine is the principal alkaloid in raw opium and constitutes roughly 8–19% of [[opium]] by dry weight (depending on growing conditions).<ref name="Jenkins AJ 2008" /> Some purpose-developed strains of poppy now produce opium that is up to 26% morphine by weight.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} A rough rule of thumb to determine the morphine content of pulverised dried poppy straw is to divide the percentage expected for the strain or crop via the latex method by eight or an empirically determined factor, which is often in the range of 5 to 15.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} The Norman strain of ''P. Somniferum'', also developed in [[Tasmania]], produces down to 0.04% morphine but with much higher amounts of [[thebaine]] and [[oripavine]], which can be used to synthesise semi-synthetic opioids as well as other drugs like stimulants, emetics, opioid antagonists, anticholinergics, and smooth-muscle agents.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In the 1950s and 1960s, [[Hungary]] supplied nearly 60% of Europe's total medication-purpose morphine production. To this day, poppy farming is legal in Hungary, but poppy farms are limited by law to {{convert|2|acre|m2}}. It is also legal to sell dried poppy in flower shops for use in floral arrangements.

It was announced in 1973 that a team at the National Institutes of Health in the United States had developed a method for total synthesis of morphine, [[codeine]], and thebaine using coal tar as a starting material. A shortage in codeine-hydrocodone class cough suppressants (all of which can be made from morphine in one or more steps, as well as from codeine or thebaine) was the initial reason for the research.

Most morphine produced for pharmaceutical use around the world is actually converted into codeine as the concentration of the latter in both raw opium and poppy straw is much lower than that of morphine; in most countries, the usage of codeine (both as end-product and precursor) is at least equal or greater than that of morphine on a weight basis.

== Precursor to other opioids ==

=== Pharmaceutical ===
Morphine is a precursor in the manufacture in a large number of opioids such as [[dihydromorphine]], [[hydromorphone]], [[hydrocodone]], and [[oxycodone]] as well as [[codeine]], which itself has a large family of semi-synthetic derivatives. Morphine is commonly treated with [[acetic anhydride]] and ignited to yield heroin.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Small LF, Lutz RE | title = Chemistry of the Opium Alkaloids | publisher = U. S. Government Printing Office | location = Washington, D. C. | year = 1932 | pages = 153–154 | asin = B000H4LBY8 }}</ref>
Throughout Europe there is growing acceptance within the medical community of the use of slow release oral morphine as a substitution treatment alternative to methadone and buprenorphine for patients not able to tolerate the side-effects of buprenorphine and methadone. Slow-release oral morphine has been in widespread use for opiate maintenance therapy in Austria, Bulgaria, and Slovakia for many years and it is available on a small scale in many other countries including the UK. The long-acting nature of slow-release morphine mimics that of buprenorphine because the sustained blood levels are relatively flat so there is no "high" per se that a patient would feel but rather a sustained feeling of wellness and avoidance of withdrawal symptoms. For patients sensitive to the side-effects that in part may be a result of the unnatural pharmacological actions of buprenorphine and methadone, slow-release oral morphine formulations offer a promising future for use managing opiate addiction.
The pharmacology of heroin and morphine is identical except the two [[acetyl]] groups increase the [[lipophilicity|lipid solubility]] of the heroin molecule, causing heroin to cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] and enter the [[Human brain|brain]] more rapidly in injection. Once in the brain, these acetyl groups are removed to yield morphine, which causes the subjective effects of heroin. Thus, heroin may be thought of as a more rapidly acting form of morphine.<ref name="Klous 2005">{{cite journal |vauthors=Klous MG, Van den Brink W, Van Ree JM, Beijnen JH | title = Development of pharmaceutical heroin preparations for medical co-prescription to opioid dependent patients | journal = Drug Alcohol Depend | volume = 80 | issue = 3 | pages = 283–95 |date=December 2005 | pmid = 15916865 | doi = 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2005.04.008 }}</ref>

=== Illicit ===
Illicit morphine is rarely produced from codeine found in over-the-counter cough and pain medicines. This demethylation reaction is often performed using pyridine and hydrochloric acid.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rapoport H, Lovell CH, Tolbert BM | title = The Preparation of Morphine-N-methyl-C<sup>14</sup> | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society |date=December 1951 | volume = 73 | issue = 12 | pages = 5900–5900 | doi = 10.1021/ja01156a543 }}</ref>

Another source of illicit morphine comes from the extraction of morphine from extended-release morphine products, such as MS-Contin. Morphine can be extracted from these products with simple extraction techniques to yield a morphine solution that can be injected.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Crews JC, Denson DD |title=Recovery of morphine from a controlled-release preparation. A source of opioid abuse |journal=Cancer |volume=66 |issue=12 |pages=2642–4 |year=1990 |pmid=2249204 |doi=10.1002/1097-0142(19901215)66:12<2642::AID-CNCR2820661229>3.0.CO;2-B}}</ref> As an alternative, the tablets can be crushed and snorted, injected or swallowed, although this provides much less euphoria but retains some of the extended-release effect, and the extended-release property is why MS-Contin is used in some countries alongside [[methadone]], [[dihydrocodeine]], [[buprenorphine]], [[dihydroetorphine]], [[piritramide]], [[Levacetylmethadol|levo-alpha-acetylmethadol]] ([[LAAM]]), and special 24-hour formulations of [[hydromorphone]] for maintenance and detoxification of those physically dependent on opioids.

Another means of using or misusing morphine is to use chemical reactions to turn it into [[heroin]] or another stronger opioid. Morphine can, using a technique reported in New Zealand (where the initial precursor is codeine) and elsewhere known as home-bake, be turned into what is usually a mixture of morphine, heroin, 3-monoacetylmorphine, 6-monoacetylmorphine, and codeine derivatives like acetylcodeine if the process is using morphine made from demethylating codeine.

Since heroin is one of a series of 3,6 diesters of morphine, it is possible to convert morphine to [[nicomorphine]] (Vilan) using nicotinic anhydride, [[dipropanoylmorphine]] with propionic anhydride, dibutanoylmorphine and disalicyloylmorphine with the respective acid anhydrides. Glacial [[acetic acid]] can be used to obtain a mixture high in 6-monoacetylmorphine, [[niacin]] (vitamin B<sub>3</sub>) in some form would be precursor to 6-nicotinylmorphine, salicylic acid may yield the salicyoyl analogue of 6-MAM, and so on.

The clandestine conversion of morphine to ketones of the hydromorphone class or other derivatives like [[dihydromorphine]] (Paramorfan), [[desomorphine]] (Permonid), [[metopon]], etc. and codeine to [[hydrocodone]] (Dicodid), [[dihydrocodeine]] (Paracodin), etc. is more involved, time-consuming, requires lab equipment of various types, and usually requires expensive catalysts and large amounts of morphine at the outset and is less common but still has been discovered by authorities in various ways during the last 20 years or so. Dihydromorphine can be acetylated into another 3,6 morphine diester, namely [[diacetyldihydromorphine]] (Paralaudin), and hydrocodone into [[thebacon]].

An opium-based elixir has been ascribed to [[Alchemy|alchemists]] of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times, but the specific formula was lost during the Ottoman conquest of [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]).<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Ramoutsaki IA, Askitopoulou H, Konsolaki E | title = Pain relief and sedation in Roman Byzantine texts: ''Mandragoras officinarum'', ''Hyoscyamos niger'' and ''Atropa belladonna'' | journal = International Congress Series |date=December 2002 | volume = 1242 | pages = 43–50 | doi = 10.1016/S0531-5131(02)00699-4 }}</ref>  Around 1522, [[Paracelsus]] made reference to an opium-based elixir that he called ''laudanum'' from the Latin word ''laudare'', meaning "to praise" He described it as a potent painkiller, but recommended that it be used sparingly. In the late eighteenth century, when the [[East India Company]] gained a direct interest in the opium trade through India, another opiate recipe called [[laudanum]] became very popular among physicians and their patients.{{citation needed|date = June 2017}}

[[Diacetylmorphine]] (better known as [[heroin]]) was synthesized from morphine in 1874 and brought to market by [[Bayer]] in 1898. Heroin is approximately 1.5 to 2 times more potent than morphine weight for weight.

Morphine became a controlled substance in the [[United States|US]] under the [[Harrison Narcotics Tax Act]] of 1914, and possession without a prescription in the US is a criminal offense.
Morphine was the most commonly abused narcotic analgesic in the world until heroin was synthesized and came into use. In general, until the synthesis of [[dihydromorphine]] (ca. 1900), the dihydromorphinone class of opioids (1920s), and [[oxycodone]] (1916) and similar drugs, there were no other drugs in the same efficacy range as opium, morphine, and heroin, with synthetics still several years away ([[pethidine]] was invented in Germany in 1937) and opioid agonists among the semi-synthetics were analogues and derivatives of codeine such as [[dihydrocodeine]] (Paracodin), [[ethylmorphine]] (Dionine), and [[benzylmorphine]] (Peronine). Even today, morphine is the most sought after prescription narcotic by heroin addicts when heroin is scarce, all other things being equal; local conditions and user preference may cause [[hydromorphone]], [[oxymorphone]], high-dose oxycodone, or [[methadone]] as well as [[dextromoramide]] in specific instances such as 1970s Australia, to top that particular list. The stop-gap drugs used by the largest absolute number of heroin addicts is probably codeine, with significant use also of [[dihydrocodeine]], poppy straw derivatives like poppy pod and poppy seed tea, [[propoxyphene]], and [[tramadol]].

The structural formula of morphine was determined by 1925 by [[Robert Robinson (organic chemist)|Robert Robinson]]. At least three methods of total synthesis of morphine from starting materials such as coal tar and petroleum distillates have been patented, the first of which was announced in 1952, by Dr. [[Marshall D. Gates, Jr.]] at the [[University of Rochester]].<ref name="urlMarshall D.

In 2003, there was discovery of endogenous morphine occurring naturally in the human body. Thirty years of speculation were made on this subject because there was a receptor that, it appeared, reacted only to morphine: the [[μ-opioid receptor|μ<sub>3</sub>-opioid receptor]] in human tissue.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhu W, Cadet P, Baggerman G, Mantione KJ, Stefano GB |title=Human white blood cells synthesize morphine: CYP2D6 modulation |journal=J.

=== Non-medical use ===
[[File:Morphine DOJ.jpg|thumb|Example of different morphine tablets]]

The euphoria, comprehensive alleviation of distress and therefore all aspects of suffering, promotion of sociability and empathy, "body high", and anxiolysis provided by narcotic drugs including the opioids can cause the use of high doses in the absence of pain for a protracted period, which can impart a morbid craving for the drug in the user. Being the prototype of the entire opioid class of drugs means that morphine has properties that may lend it to misuse. Morphine addiction is the model upon which the current perception of addiction is based.{{mcn|date=October 2015}}

Animal and human studies and clinical experience back up the contention that morphine is one of the most euphoric drugs known, and via all but the IV route heroin and morphine cannot be distinguished according to studies because heroin is a prodrug for the delivery of systemic morphine. Chemical changes to the morphine molecule yield other euphorigenics such as [[dihydromorphine]], [[hydromorphone]] (Dilaudid, Hydal), and [[oxymorphone]] (Numorphan, Opana), as well as the latter three's methylated equivalents [[dihydrocodeine]], [[hydrocodone]], and oxycodone, respectively; in addition to heroin, there are [[dipropanoylmorphine]], [[diacetyldihydromorphine]], and other members of the 3,6 morphine diester category like [[nicomorphine]] and other similar semi-synthetic opiates like [[desomorphine]], [[hydromorphinol]], etc. used clinically in many countries of the world but in many cases also produced illicitly in rare instances.{{mcn|date=October 2015}}

In general, non-medical use of morphine entails taking more than prescribed or outside of medical supervision, injecting oral formulations, mixing it with unapproved potentiators such as alcohol, cocaine, and the like, or defeating the extended-release mechanism by chewing the tablets or turning into a powder for snorting or preparing injectables. The latter method can be as time-consuming and involved as traditional methods of smoking opium. This and the fact that the liver destroys a large percentage of the drug on the first pass impacts the demand side of the equation for clandestine re-sellers, as many customers are not needle users and may have been disappointed with ingesting the drug orally. As morphine is generally as hard or harder to divert than [[oxycodone]] in a lot of cases, morphine in any form is uncommon on the street, although ampoules and phials of morphine injection, pure pharmaceutical morphine powder, and soluble multi-purpose tablets are very popular where available.{{mcn|date=October 2015}}

Morphine is also available in a paste that is used in the production of heroin, which can be smoked by itself or turned to a soluble salt and injected; the same goes for the penultimate products of the Kompot (Polish Heroin) and black tar processes. Poppy straw as well as opium can yield morphine of purity levels ranging from poppy tea to near-pharmaceutical-grade morphine by itself or with all of the more than 50 other alkaloids. It also is the active narcotic ingredient in opium and all of its forms, derivatives, and analogues as well as forming from breakdown of heroin and otherwise present in many batches of illicit heroin as the result of incomplete acetylation.{{mcn|date=October 2015}}

=== Slang terms ===
Informal names for morphine include: Cube Juice, Dope, Dreamer, Emsel, First Line, God's Drug, Hard Stuff, Hocus, Hows, Lydia, Lydic, M, Miss Emma, Mister Blue, Monkey, Morf, Morph, Morphide, Morphie, Morpho, Mother, MS, Ms. Emma, Mud, New Jack Swing (if mixed with [[heroin]]), Sister, Tab, Unkie, Unkie White, and Stuff.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=G7As-qawdzMC&pg=PA95&dq=happy+powder#v=onepage&q=cube%2520juice&f=false|title=The Encyclopedia of Addictive Drugs|last=Miller|first=Richard Lawrence|date=1 January 2002|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|isbn=978-0-313-31807-8|page=306|language=en}}</ref>

MS Contin tablets are known as misties, and the 100&nbsp;mg extended-release tablets as greys and blockbusters. The "[[speedball (drug)|speedball]]" can use morphine as the opioid component, which is combined with cocaine, [[amphetamines]], [[methylphenidate]], or similar drugs. "Blue Velvet" is a combination of morphine with the antihistamine [[tripelennamine]] (Pyrabenzamine, PBZ, Pelamine) taken by injection, or less commonly the mixture when swallowed or used as a retention enema; the name is also known to refer to a combination of tripelennamine and dihydrocodeine or codeine tablets or syrups taken by mouth. "Morphia" is an older official term for morphine also used as a slang term. "Driving Miss Emma" is intravenous administration of morphine. Multi-purpose tablets (readily soluble hypodermic tablets that can also be swallowed or dissolved under the tongue or betwixt the cheek and jaw) are known, as are some brands of hydromorphone, as Shake & Bake or Shake & Shoot.

Morphine can be smoked, especially diacetylmorphine (heroin), the most common method being the "Chasing The Dragon" method. To perform a relatively crude acetylation to turn the morphine into heroin and related drugs immediately prior to use is known as AAing (for Acetic Anhydride) or home-bake, and the output of the procedure also known as home-bake or, Blue Heroin (not to be confused with Blue Magic heroin, or the linctus known as Blue Morphine or Blue Morphone, or the Blue Velvet mixture described above).

=== Trade names ===
Morphine is [[marketing|marketed]] under many different [[brand name]]s in various parts of the world.<ref name="drugs.com-page">drugs.com [http://www.drugs.com/international/morphine.html Drugs.com international listings for Morphine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614052020/http://www.drugs.com/international/morphine.html |date=14 June 2015 }} Page accessed 2 June 2015</ref>

=== Access in developing countries ===
Although morphine is cheap, people in poorer countries often do not have access to it. According to a 2005 estimate by the [[International Narcotics Control Board]], six countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States) consume 79% of the world’s morphine. The less affluent countries, accounting for 80% of the world's population, consumed only about 6% of the global morphine supply.{{Citation needed|date = June 2017}} Some countries{{which|date=June 2017}} import virtually no morphine, and in others{{which|date=June 2017}} the drug is rarely available even for relieving severe pain while dying.{{Citation needed|date = June 2017}}

Experts in pain management attribute the under-distribution of morphine to an unwarranted fear of the drug's potential for addiction and abuse. While morphine is clearly addictive, Western doctors believe it is worthwhile to use the drug and then wean the patient off when the treatment is over.<ref>{{cite news|author= Donald G.
