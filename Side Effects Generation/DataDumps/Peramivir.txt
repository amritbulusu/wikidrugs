'''Peramivir''' (trade name '''Rapivab''') is an [[antiviral drug]] developed by [[BioCryst Pharmaceuticals]] for the treatment of [[influenza]]. Peramivir is a [[neuraminidase inhibitor]], acting as a [[transition state|transition-state]] analogue inhibitor of influenza [[viral neuraminidase|neuraminidase]] and thereby preventing new viruses from emerging from infected cells. It is approved for intravenous administration.<ref name=FDA_Dec_2014 />

In October 2009, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) issued an [[emergency use authorization]] (EUA) for the use of peramivir based on safety data from phase I, phase II, and limited phase III trial data. The emergency use authorization for peramivir expired in June 2010.<ref name="thorlund syst review">{{cite journal|last=Thorlund|first=Kristian|author2=Awad, Tahany |author3=Boivin, Guy |author4= Thabane, Lehana |title=Systematic review of influenza resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitors|journal=BMC Infectious Diseases|date=2011|volume=11|issue=1|pages=134|doi=10.1186/1471-2334-11-134 |pmid=21592407 |pmc=3123567}}</ref><ref>{{cite web

Peramivir has also been approved in Japan and South Korea and is available in Japan as '''Rapiacta''' and in South Korea as '''Peramiflu'''. As of 2015, it is the only intravenous option for treating swine flu.

==History==
An intramuscular (IM) peramivir phase II study for seasonal influenza in 2008–2009 found no effect for the primary endpoint of improvement in the median time to alleviation of symptoms in subjects with confirmed, acute, uncomplicated influenza infection versus placebo.

In October 2009, it was reported that the experimental [[antiviral drug]] peramivir had been "life-saving" effective in intravenous treating 8 serious cases of [[2009 flu pandemic|swine flu]].<ref name="Peramivir">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/10/19/eveningnews/main5398999.shtml?tag=stack|title=Life-Saving H1N1 Drug Unavailable to Most|date=2009-10-19|work=CBS Evening News|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=2009-10-20|location=Atlanta, GA, USA}}</ref> On October 23, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) issued an [[Emergency Use Authorization]] for peramivir, allowing the use of the drug in intravenous form for hospitalized patients only in cases where the other available methods of treatment are ineffective or unavailable;<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS10540+24-Oct-2009+PRN20091024 | work=Reuters | title=Emergency Use Authorization Granted For BioCryst's Peramivir | date=2009-10-24}}</ref> for instance, if [[oseltamivir]] resistance develops and a person is unable to take [[zanamivir]] via the inhaled route. The U.S. government (department of Health and Human Services) gave BioCryst Pharmaceuticals more than $77 million to finish the Phase III clinical development of peramivir. In 2009 the department of Health and Human Services had already given about $180 million to the program.<ref>{{cite news|title=Feds hand BioCryst $77M for anti-viral trial|url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/feds-hand-biocryst-77m-anti-viral-trial/2009-09-21|newspaper=Fierce biotech|date=September 21, 2009}}</ref> Biocryst also donated 1200 courses of treatment to the US department of Health and Human Services.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS10036+24-Oct-2009+PRN20091024 | work=Reuters | title=FDA Authorizes Emergency Use of Intravenous Antiviral Peramivir for 2009 H1N1 Influenza for Certain Patients, Settings | date=2009-10-24}}</ref> The Emergency Use Authorization expired on June 23, 2010.
In 2011 a phase III trial found the median durations of influenza symptoms were the same with 1 intravenous injection of peramivir against 5 days of oral oseltamivir for people with seasonal influenza virus infection.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kohno|first=S.|author2=Yen, M.-Y. |author3=Cheong, H.-J. |author4=Hirotsu, N. |author5=Ishida, T. |author6=Kadota, J.-i. |author7=Mizuguchi, M. |author8=Kida, H. |author9= Shimada, J.  |title=Phase III Randomized, Double-Blind Study Comparing Single-Dose Intravenous Peramivir with Oral Oseltamivir in Patients with Seasonal Influenza Virus Infection|journal=[[Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy]]|date=8 August 2011|volume=55|issue=11|pages=5267–5276|doi=10.1128/AAC.00360-11}}</ref>

In 2012 BioCryst reported that it should halt enrollment on its study for intravenous peramivir in potentially life-threatened people after an interim analysis led trial monitors to conclude that it would be futile to continue and the trial should be terminated. The difference between peramivir and control group (oral oseltamivir) for the primary endpoint, clinical or virologic, was small.<ref>{{cite news|title=BioCryst scraps $235M late-stage flu drug program backed by feds|url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/biocryst-scraps-235m-late-stage-flu-drug-program-backed-feds/2012-11-08|newspaper=Fierce Biotech|date=November 8, 2012}}</ref> In 2013 the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA/HHS) released new funding under the current $234.8 million contract to enable completion of a New Drug Application filing for intravenous (IV) peramivir.<ref>{{cite news|title=BioCryst to File Peramivir NDA Supported by BARDA/HHS Funding|url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/press-releases/biocryst-file-peramivir-nda-supported-bardahhs-funding|newspaper=Fierce Biotech|date=July 11, 2013}}</ref>

According to a research report published in June 2011, a new variant of swine flu had emerged in Asia with a genetic adaptation (a S247N neuraminidase mutation) giving some resistance to oseltamivir and zanamivir, but no significant reduction in sensitivity to peramivir.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hurt|first=A.C.|title=Increased detection in Australia and Singapore of a novel influenza A(H1N1)2009 variant with reduced oseltamivir and zanamivir sensitivity due to a S247N neuraminidase mutation|url=http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19884|newspaper=Eurosurveillance|date=9 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/10/flu-drugs-idUSLDE7590QO20110610?feedType=RSS&feedName=rbssHealthcareNews&rpc=43 | work=Reuters | first=Ben | last=Hirschler | title=Swine flu starting to show resistance to drugs | date=2011-06-10}}</ref> But a H274Y virus mutation showed resistance to oseltamivir and peramivir, but not to zanamivir, and only in N1 neuraminidases.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McKimm-Breschkin|first=JL|title=Influenza neuraminidase inhibitors: antiviral action and mechanisms of resistance.|journal=[[Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses]]|date=Jan 2013|volume=7 Suppl 1|pages=25–36|pmid=23279894|doi=10.1111/irv.12047}}</ref> Ultimately 3.2% (19/599) of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses collected between 2009 and 2012 had highly reduced peramivir inhibition due to the H275Y NA mutation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Leang|first=Sook-Kwan|author2=Kwok, Simon |author3=Sullivan, Sheena G. |author4=Maurer-Stroh, Sebastian |author5=Kelso, Anne |author6=Barr, Ian G. |author7= Hurt, Aeron C. |title=Peramivir and laninamivir susceptibility of circulating influenza A and B viruses|journal=[[Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses]]|date=March 2014|volume=8|issue=2|pages=135–139|doi=10.1111/irv.12187}}</ref>
