The [[medical use]]s of estradiol valerate are the same as those of estradiol and other estrogens. Examples of indications for the drug include [[hormone replacement therapy]] and [[hormonal contraception]]. In regards to the latter, estradiol valerate is available in combination with a [[progestogen]] as an [[combined oral contraceptive|combined]] [[estradiol-containing oral contraceptive]] (with [[dienogest]])<ref name="pmid21151673">{{cite journal | vauthors = Guida M, Bifulco G, Di Spiezio Sardo A, Scala M, Fernandez LM, Nappi C | title = Review of the safety, efficacy and patient acceptability of the combined dienogest/estradiol valerate contraceptive pill | journal = International Journal of Women's Health | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 279–90 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21151673 | pmc = 2990895 | doi = 10.2147/IJWH.S6954 | url = }}</ref> and as a [[combined injectable contraceptive]] (with [[hydroxyprogesterone caproate]] or [[norethisterone enanthate]]).<ref name="pmid12290848">{{cite journal | vauthors = Newton JR, D'arcangues C, Hall PE | title = A review of "once-a-month" combined injectable contraceptives | journal = J Obstet Gynaecol (Lahore) | volume = 4 Suppl 1 | issue = | pages = S1–34 | year = 1994 | pmid = 12290848 | doi = 10.3109/01443619409027641| url = }}</ref><ref>http://www.wjpps.com/download/article/1412071798.pdf</ref><ref name="Rowlands2009">{{cite journal|last1=Rowlands|first1=S|title=New technologies in contraception|journal=BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology|volume=116|issue=2|year=2009|pages=230–239|issn=1470-0328|doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.2008.01985.x}}</ref>

==Side effects==
{{Main article|Estradiol (medication)#Adverse effects}}

The [[side effect]]s of estradiol valerate are the same as those of estradiol. Examples of such side effects include [[breast tenderness]] and [[breast enlargement|enlargement]], [[nausea]], [[bloating]], [[edema]], [[headache]], and [[melasma]].<ref name="Ghosh2010">{{cite book|author=Amit K. Ghosh|title=Mayo Clinic Internal Medicine Board Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LS65jBzoD40C&pg=PA222|date=23 September 2010|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=978-0-19-975569-1|pages=222–}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
The [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] of estradiol valerate (before [[bond cleavage|cleavage]]) for the [[estrogen receptor]] is approximately 50&nbsp;times lower than that of estradiol (after [[bond cleavage|cleavage]]).<ref name="pmid7169965" /> In addition, estradiol valerate (before [[bond cleavage|cleavage]]) is unable to reach target tissues in any concentration of significance, if at all.<ref name="pmid7169965" /> As such, estradiol valerate (before [[bond cleavage|cleavage]]) is essentially inactive in terms of estrogenic effect itself, acting solely as a [[prodrug]] to estradiol (after [[bond cleavage|cleavage]]).<ref name="pmid7169965" />

This is, however, not an issue as estradiol valerate is cleaved very rapidly in the body.<ref name="pmid7169965" /> The post-cleavage 17β-estradiol is [[bioidentical hormone replacement therapy|bioidentical]] to estrogen.<ref name="KuhnzBlode1993" /> In practise, oral estradiol valerate is considered to be equivalent to micronized estradiol, due to its fast conversion speed as [[prodrug]].<ref name="pmid7169965" />

===Pharmacokinetics===
Upon ingestion, regardless of the [[route of administration]], estradiol valerate behaves as a [[prodrug]] via [[bond cleavage|cleavage]] by [[esterase]]s into estradiol and the natural [[fatty acid]] [[valeric acid]].<ref name="pmid7169965">{{cite journal |vauthors=Düsterberg B, Nishino Y | title = Pharmacokinetic and pharmacological features of oestradiol valerate | journal = Maturitas | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = 315–24 |date=December 1982 | pmid = 7169965 | doi = 10.1016/0378-5122(82)90064-0| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0378-5122(82)90064-0}}</ref><ref name="pmid16112947" /><ref name="Progynova">{{cite web | url = http://www.drugs.com/uk/progynova-1mg-spc-3430.html | title = Progynova 1mg (SPC) &#124; Drugs.com | work = | accessdate = 2012-09-06}}</ref> This cleavage occurs not only in the [[liver]], but also in the [[blood]] and in [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s, and the [[hydrolysis]] of estradiol valerate into estradiol and valeric acid is complete regardless of whether the drug is administered [[oral administration|orally]] or [[parenteral]]ly.<ref name="pmid7169965" /> High levels of circulating estradiol are found after an [[intravenous injection]] of estradiol valerate, and this indicates very rapid cleavage of the drug upon entering circulation.<ref name="pmid7169965" /> In contrast to estradiol, which can distribute into and exert its effects in target tissues, valeric acid is quickly metabolized via [[beta oxidation]] (see also [[fatty acid metabolism]]).<ref name="pmid7169965" />

====Oral administration====
The [[esterification]] of the C17β position of estradiol as in estradiol valerate prevents the [[metabolism]] of estradiol valerate by [[17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]] (17β-HSD).<ref name="pmid16112947" /> As approximately 80% of estradiol is metabolized into estrone (and estrone sulfate) by 17β-HSD during [[first-pass metabolism]], this improves the [[metabolic stability]] and hence [[bioavailability]] of estradiol valerate.<ref name="KuhnzBlode1993" /> However, estradiol valerate is hydrolyzed into estradiol and valeric acid in the [[intestine]]s, and hence, is still subject to extensive (albeit comparatively reduced) first-pass metabolism.<ref name="pmid16112947" /> As such, the oral bioavailability of estradiol valerate is only around 3 to 5%, and is comparable to that of micronized estradiol (which has similarly improved bioavailability relative to (non-micronized) oral estradiol).<ref name="pmid7169965" /><ref name="pmid16112947" /> Due to its nature as a rapidly converted prodrug of estradiol, the [[pharmacokinetics]] of estradiol valerate are similar to those of micronized estradiol.<ref name="pmid7169965" /><ref name="pmid16112947" /> Moreover, the [[pharmacodynamics]] and [[potency (pharmacology)|potency]] (after differences in [[molecular weight]] are taken into account) of oral estradiol valerate are considered to be equivalent to those of micronized estradiol.<ref name="pmid7169965" /> This is also notably true for effects on [[hepatic protein synthesis]] (e.g., of {{abbrlink|SHBG|sex hormone-binding globulin}}), again after differences in molecular weight between the two drugs are considered.<ref name="pmid7169965" />

A dosage of 1&nbsp;mg/day oral estradiol valerate has been found to produce approximate circulating concentrations of 50 pg/mL estradiol and 160&nbsp;pg/mL estrone, while a dosage of 2&nbsp;mg/day results in circulating levels of 60&nbsp;pg/mL estradiol and 300&nbsp;pg/mL estrone.<ref name="pmid8530713">{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Connell MB | title = Pharmacokinetic and pharmacologic variation between different estrogen products | journal = J Clin Pharmacol | volume = 35 | issue = 9 Suppl | pages = 18S–24S | year = 1995 | pmid = 8530713 | doi = | url = }}</ref> These concentrations of estradiol and estrone are comparable to those observed with 1 and 2&nbsp;mg/day oral micronized estradiol.<ref name="pmid8530713" />

In contrast to oral administration, the bioavailability of estradiol valerate has been found to be complete (i.e., 100%) via intramuscular injection.<ref name="pmid7169965" /><ref name="pmid16112947" /> Due to the far greater bioavailability of intramuscular estradiol valerate relative to oral, the former is substantially stronger (in terms of potency) than the latter.<ref name="pmid7169965" /> As an example, a single 4&nbsp;mg intramuscular injection is said to be approximately equivalent to 2&nbsp;mg/day of the drug administered orally over the course of 3 weeks.<ref name="pmid7169965" /> Estradiol valerate, when given intramuscularly in [[oil]], has a relatively long duration due to the formation of an intramuscular [[depot injection|depot]] from which the drug is slowly released and absorbed.<ref name="pmid7169965" /><ref name="Sriram">{{cite book | author = Sriram | title = Medicinal Chemistry | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9HSoZrcBRl0C&pg=PA427 | accessdate = 20 May 2012 | publisher = Pearson Education India | isbn = 978-81-317-0031-0 | page = 427}}</ref> Upon intramuscular injection of estradiol valerate in an oil solution, the solvent (i.e., oil) is absorbed, and a primary [[microcrystalline]] depot is formed within the [[muscle]] at the site of injection.<ref name="pmid16112947" /> In addition, a secondary depot may also be formed in [[adipose tissue]].<ref name="pmid16112947" /> The slow release of estradiol valerate is caused by the increased [[lipophilicity]] of the drug, which in turn is due to its long fatty acid valeric acid ester [[moiety (chemistry)|moiety]].<ref name="pmid7169965" /> The [[terminal half-life]] of intramuscularly administered estradiol valerate in oil is reported to be 4 to 5 days.<ref name="pmid7169965" />

A single intramuscular injection of 4&nbsp;mg estradiol valerate has been found to result in maximal circulating levels of estradiol of about 390 pg/mL within 3 days of administration, with levels declining to 100 pg/mL (baseline, in the study) by 12–13 days.<ref name="NotelovitzKeep2012">{{cite book|author1=M.
