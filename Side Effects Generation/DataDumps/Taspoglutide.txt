'''Taspoglutide''' is a [[pharmaceutical drug]], a [[glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist]] (GLP-1 agonist), under investigation for treatment of [[type 2 diabetes]] being codeveloped by [[Ipsen]] and [[Hoffmann–La Roche|Roche]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2008_June_10/ai_n25492242 |title=Ipsen: Roche Moves Investigational Diabetes Drug, Taspoglutide, into Phase III Clinical Trials |date = June 2008| work=Business Wire}}</ref>

Of the eight planned phase III clinical trials of weekly taspoglutide (four against [[exenatide]], [[sitagliptin]], [[insulin glargine]], and [[pioglitazone]]), at least five were active in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/169171.php |title=Ipsen's Partner Roche Announces That Taspoglutide Meets Its Primary Endpoint In The First Phase III Clinical Trial |date=October 2009}}</ref> Preliminary results in early 2010 were favourable.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.genengnews.com/news/bnitem.aspx?name=75286047 |title=Roche Reports Positive Data from Five Phase III Trials of Type 2 Diabetes Therapy |date=February 2010}}</ref> (At least one of the eight planned phase III trials had not started recruiting by end 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clinicaltrial.gov/ct2/show/NCT01051011 |title=A Study to Compare Taspoglutide and Insulin Glargine in Insulin-Naïve Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Inadequately Controlled on Metformin and Sulfonylurea Combination Therapy }}</ref>)

In September 2010 Roche halted Phase III clinical trials due to incidences of serious hypersensitivity reactions and gastrointestinal side effects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/Endocrinology/Diabetes/22139 |title=Roche Halts Trials of Taspoglutide }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/200893.php |title=Experimental Diabetes Drug Taspoglutide Late-Stage Trials Suspended }}</ref>

{{As of|May 2013}} no new trials had been registered.<ref>[http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=taspoglutide&Search=Search Clinical studies of taspoglutide]</ref>{{update after|2014}}

==Chemistry==
Taspoglutide is the peptide with the sequence H<sub>2</sub>N-His-2-methyl-Ala-Glu-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Asp-Val-Ser-Ser-Tyr-Leu-Glu-Gly-Gln-Ala-Ala-Lys-Glu-Phe-Ile-Ala-Trp-Leu-Val-Lys-2-methyl-Ala-Arg-CONH<sub>2</sub>.

In other words, it  is the 8-(2-methylalanine)-35-(2-methylalanine)-36-<small>L</small>-argininamide derivative of the amino acid sequence 7–36 of human glucagon-like peptide I.
