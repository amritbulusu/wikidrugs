'''2,5-Dimethoxy-4-propylamphetamine''' ('''DOPR''') is a [[psychedelic_drug|psychedelic]] [[drug]] of the [[substituted phenethylamine|phenethylamine]] and [[substituted amphetamine|amphetamine]] [[chemical class]]es. It was first [[Organic synthesis|synthesized]] by [[Alexander Shulgin]], and was described in his book ''[[PiHKAL]]'' (''Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved''). Shulgin described DOPR is a "heavy duty psychedelic", complete with alterations of the thought process and visual distortion.<ref name="PiHKAL">{{cite book | title = PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story | last = Shulgin | first = Alexander |author2= Shulgin, Ann   | publisher = Transform Press | location = United States | isbn = 0-9630096-0-5 | pages = 978 | url = http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal.shtml |date= September 1991}}</ref> Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of DOPR.

The alternative structural isomer [[2,5-Dimethoxy-4-isopropylamphetamine|DOIP]], with a 4-isopropyl substitution, is also known but is around ten times weaker than DOPR, with an active dose of some 20-30 mg (as compared to 2-5 mg for DOPR).<ref name="PiHKAL"/>
