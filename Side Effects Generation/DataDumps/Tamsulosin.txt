'''Tamsulosin''', sold under the [[trade name]] '''Alna ® / Flomax ®''', is a medication used to treat symptomatic [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] (BPH), help with the passage of [[kidney stones]],<ref name=Wang2016>{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=RC|last2=Smith-Bindman|first2=R|last3=Whitaker|first3=E|last4=Neilson|first4=J|last5=Allen|first5=IE|last6=Stoller|first6=ML|last7=Fahimi|first7=J|title=Effect of Tamsulosin on Stone Passage for Ureteral Stones: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.|journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine|date=7 September 2016|pmid=27616037|doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2016.06.044}}</ref> and for [[urinary retention]] along with other measures.

Tamsulosin, and other medications in the class called [[alpha blockers]], work by relaxing bladder neck muscles and muscle fibers in the prostate itself and make it easier to urinate.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/prostate-gland-enlargement/DS00027/DSECTION=treatments-and-drugs | title = Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) | publisher = [[Mayo Clinic]]}}</ref> It is an [[alpha-1A adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1a</sub> adrenergic receptor]] antagonist.

Tamsulosin was developed by Yamanouchi Pharmaceuticals (now part of [[Astellas Pharma]]) and was first marketed in 1996. The U.S. patent expired in October 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Flomax – Big Patent Expirations of 2010 | url=http://www.fiercepharma.com/special-reports/flomax-big-patent-expirations-2010|date=10 February 2010|accessdate=14 January 2012}}</ref> The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved generics in March 2010.<ref>{{cite press release| url = http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm202728.htm| title = FDA Approves First Generic Tamsulosin to Treat Enlarged Prostate Gland| date = 2 March 2010| publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)}}</ref>

Tamsulosin is also used as an add on treatment for [[acute urinary retention]]. People may void more successfully after catheter removal if they are taking tamsulosin. People taking tamsulosin are also less likely to need re-catheterization.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lucas MG, Stephenson TP, Nargund V |title=Tamsulosin in the management of patients in acute urinary retention from benign prostatic hyperplasia |journal=BJU Int. |volume=95 |issue=3 |pages=354–7 |date=February 2005  |pmid=15679793 |doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.2005.05299.x |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Jeong IG, You D, Yoon JH, etal |title=Impact of tamsulosin on urinary retention following early catheter removal after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: A prospective randomized controlled trial |journal=Int.

Tamsulosin can also cause [[retrograde ejaculation]], which occurs when semen is redirected to the urinary bladder instead of being ejaculated normally. This is because tamsulosin relaxes the muscles of the [[urethral sphincters]], which are normally closed during ejaculation. This side effect can be mitigated by regular [[Kegel exercise|pelvic floor (Kegel) exercise]] and contracting the pelvic floor during ejaculation.<ref>

== Combination therapy ==
The results of the CombAT (combination of [[dutasteride]] and tamsulosin under the brand name ''Duodart'') trial in 2008 demonstrated that treatment with the combination of dutasteride (''Avodart'') and tamsulosin provides greater symptom benefits compared to monotherapy with either agent alone for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.<ref name="Roehrborn2008">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Roehrborn CG, Siami P, Barkin J, etal |title=The effects of dutasteride, tamsulosin and combination therapy on lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatic enlargement: 2-year results from the CombAT study |journal=J.

The CombAT trial became the medication [[Jalyn]].  It was approved by the FDA on 14 June 2010.<ref>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2010/022460Orig1s000Approv.pdf Approval letter]</ref>  This combination can be useful as it can take up to six months for any symptomatic relief to be found by 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors such as dutasteride compared to alpha-1 receptor blockers which can provide relief in some cases within 48 hours.<ref>Australian Medicines Handbook {{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}</ref>

== Mechanism ==
{{Main article|Alpha blocker}}
Tamsulosin is a selective [[alpha 1 receptor|α<sub>1</sub> receptor]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] that has preferential selectivity for the [[Alpha-1A adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1A</sub> receptor]] in the prostate versus the [[Alpha-1B adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1B</sub> receptor]] in the blood vessels.<ref name=pharmnemonics>{{Cite book | author=Shen, Howard | title=Illustrated Pharmacology Memory Cards: PharMnemonics | year=2008 | publisher=Minireview | isbn=1-59541-101-1 | page=13}}</ref>

When alpha 1 receptors in the bladder neck and the prostate are blocked, this causes a relaxation in smooth muscle and therefore less resistance to urinary flow. Due to this, the pain associated with BPH can be reduced.

Selective action of tamsulosin in alpha 1A/D receptors is controversial and over three quarters of tamsulosin registered human studies are unpublished.<ref name="BirdDelaney2013">{{cite journal|last1=Bird|first1=S. T.|last2=Delaney|first2=J. A. C.|last3=Brophy|first3=J. M.|last4=Etminan|first4=M.|last5=Skeldon|first5=S. C.|last6=Hartzema|first6=A.
