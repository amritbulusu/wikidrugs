'''γ-Valerolactone''' ('''GVL''') is an [[organic compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. This colourless liquid is one of the more common [[lactone]]s.  GVL is chiral but is usually used as the [[racemate]]. It is readily obtained from cellulosic biomass and is a potential fuel and [[green solvent]].

GVL behaves as a [[prodrug]] to [[gamma-Hydroxyvaleric acid|γ-hydroxyvaleric acid]] (GHV), a [[drug]] with similar effects to those of [[gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|γ-hydroxybutyric acid]] (GHB), albeit with less potentcy in comparison.<ref name="pmid23486087">{{cite journal | vauthors = Andresen-Streichert H, Jungen H, Gehl A, Müller A, Iwersen-Bergmann S | title = Uptake of gamma-valerolactone--detection of gamma-hydroxyvaleric acid in human urine samples | journal = J Anal Toxicol | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 250–4 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23486087 | doi = 10.1093/jat/bkt013 | url = }}</ref> Because GHB is controlled in many parts of the world, while GVL is not, GVL has gained popularity as a legal substitute for GHB.<ref name="pmid23486087" /><ref name="Smith2004">{{cite book|author=Fred Smith|title=Handbook of Forensic Drug Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8JsQgRO3QcwC&pg=PA462|date=31 December 2004|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-047289-8|pages=462–}}</ref>

==Synthesis==
GVL is produced from [[levulinic acid]], which is obtained from [[hexose]]s.  In a typical process, cellulosic [[biomass]]es, such as corn stover, sawgrass, or wood, is hydrolysed into [[glucose]] and other sugars using [[acid catalyst]]s.  The resulting glucose can then be dehydrated via [[hydroxymethylfurfural]] to yield [[formic acid]] and [[levulinic acid]], which cyclises to intermediate [[furan|unsaturated ring compounds]], which can then be [[hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] to ''gamma''-valerolactone, which has potential applications as a liquid fuel.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Huber | first1 = George W. | last2 = Iborra | first2 = Sara | last3 = Corma | first3 = Avelino | year = 2006 | title = Synthesis of Transportation Fuels from Biomass: Chemistry, Catalysts, and Engineering | url = | journal = Chemical Reviews | volume = 106 | issue = 9| pages = 4044–4098 | doi = 10.1021/cr068360d | pmid=16967928}}</ref>

==Potential applications==
GVL has been identified as a potential green solvent. Because of its herbal odor, it is used in the perfume and flavor industries.<ref>[http://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/data/rw1024031.html GoodScentsCompany.com]</ref>  It is a structural isomer of [[delta-valerolactone|δ-valerolactone]].

===Potential fuel===
Since it is readily obtained from glucose, GVL has long been identified as a potential "green fuel."<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Huber | first1 = G.

The first step in this process is the ring-opening of GVL to yield a mixture of pentenoic acids. These acids can then be [[decarboxylation|decarboxylated]] to produce [[butene]] and CO<sub>2</sub>. These conversions can be performed with [[zeolite]] catalysts.<ref name="Bond">{{cite journal | first1=Jesse Q. | last1=Bond | first2=David Martin | last2=Alonso | first3=Dong | last3=Wang | first4=Ryan M. | last4=West | first5=James A. | last5=Dumesic | year = 2010 | title = Integrated Catalytic Conversion of γ-Valerolactone to Liquid Alkenes for Transportation Fuels | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/327/5969/1110.full | journal= Science | volume = 327 | issue = 5969| pages = 1110–1114 | doi = 10.1126/science.1184362 | pmid=20185721}}</ref> After this stream is dehydrated, the products can be [[oligomer]]ized at elevated pressures in the presence of a common acid-catalyst to yield alkenes with higher [[molecular mass|molecular weights]], targeted for gasoline and other fuel applications.<ref>{{cite journal | author= Mantilla, A.; | year = 2005 | title = Oligomerization of isobutene on sulfated titania: Effect of reaction conditions on selectivity | url = | journal = Catalysis Today | volume = 107–108 | issue = | pages = 707–712 | doi=10.1016/j.cattod.2005.07.153| author2 = and others | displayauthors = 1 | last3 = Ferrat | last4 = López-Ortega | last5 = Alfaro | last6 = Gómez | last7 = Torres }}</ref>

One of the main advantages that allows GVL to be a practical [[biofuel]] is that it is relatively inexpensive to produce. Using a cheap [[raw materials|feedstock]], this biofuel can be produced at prices between 2-3 US$/gallon.<ref name="Savage"/> The conversion of GVL to transportation fuel capable alkenes only requires a system containing two flow reactors, two phase separators, and a simple pumping arrangement for the delivery of an aqueous GVL feed. Since the use of [[precious metal]] catalysts is not required, this also decreases the total price of fuel production.<ref name="Bond"/>

===Potential production of biomass-derived fuels===
Apart from its value as a potential fuel in its own right, gamma-valerolactone has shown promise in laboratory-scale thermocatalytic production of soluble carbohydrates from corn [[stover]] and wood at high yields. The biomass reacts in a solvent mixture of water, dilute sulfuric acid, and gamma-valerolactone, itself derived from biomass. The gamma-valerolactone promotes thermocatalytic hydrolysis into monosaccharides by complete solubilization of the raw material, including lignins. The saccharide products can be recovered from the lactone into water solution by antisolvent addition of salt or liquid carbon dioxide. The product can be used as feedstock for producing furans or ethanol at high yield, while the gamma-valerolactone is returned to the catalytic cycle.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Luterbacher | first1 = Jeremy S. | last2 = Rand | first2 = Jacqueline M. | last3 = David | last4 = Alonso | first4 = Martin | last5 = Han | first5 = Jeehoon | last6 = Youngquist | first6 = J.
