'''Polysorbates''' are a class of [[emulsifier]]s used in some pharmaceuticals and food preparation. They are often used in cosmetics to solubilize [[essential oil]]s into water-based products. Polysorbates are oily liquids derived from [[ethoxylation|ethoxylated]] [[sorbitan]] (a derivative of [[sorbitol]]) [[ester]]ified with [[fatty acid]]s. Common brand names for polysorbates include Scattics, Alkest, Canarcel, and Tween.<ref name=Ullmann>Hubert Schiweck, Albert Bär, Roland Vogel, Eugen Schwarz, Markwart Kunz, Cécile Dusautois, Alexandre Clement, Caterine Lefranc, Bernd Lüssem, Matthias Moser, Siegfried Peters "Sugar Alcohols" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2012, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a25_413.pub3}}</ref>

== Examples ==
* [[Polysorbate 20]] (polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monolaurate) 
* Polysorbate 40 (polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monopalmitate) 
* Polysorbate 60 (polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monostearate) 
* [[Polysorbate 80]] (polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monooleate)

The number 20 following the 'polyoxyethylene' part refers to the total number of oxyethylene -(CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>O)- groups found in the molecule. The number following the 'polysorbate' part is related to the type of fatty acid associated with the polyoxyethylene sorbitan part of the molecule. [[Lauric acid|Monolaurate]] is indicated by 20, [[palmitic acid|monopalmitate]] is indicated by 40, [[stearic acid|monostearate]] by 60, and [[oleic acid|monooleate]] by 80.
