'''Thiamphenicol''' (also known as '''thiophenicol''' and '''dextrosulphenidol''') is an [[antibiotic]]. It is the [[methyl]]-[[sulfonyl]] analogue of [[chloramphenicol]] and has a similar spectrum of activity, but is 2.5 to 5 times as potent.  Like chloramphenicol, it is insoluble in water, but highly soluble in [[lipid]]s.  It is used in many countries as a [[veterinary]] antibiotic, but is available in China, Morocco and Italy for use in humans.  Its main advantage over chloramphenicol is that it has never been associated with [[aplastic anaemia]].

Thiamphenicol is also widely used in [[Brazil]], particularly for the treatment of [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infection]]s and [[pelvic inflammatory disease]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Fuchs FD |chapter=Tetraciclinas e cloranfenicol |veditors=Fuchs FD, Wannmacher L, Ferreira MB |title=Farmacologia clínica: fundamentos da terapêutica racional |language=Portuguese |edition=3rd |publisher=Guanabara Koogan |location=Rio de Janeiro |year=2004 |pages=375 |isbn=0-7216-5944-6}}</ref>

Unlike chloramphenicol, thiamphenicol is not readily metabolized in cattle, poultry, sheep, or humans, but is predominantly excreted unchanged. In pigs and rats the drug is excreted both as parent drug and as thiamphenicol glucuronate (FAO, 1997).
