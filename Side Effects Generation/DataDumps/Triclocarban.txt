'''Triclocarban''' is an [[antibacterial]] agent common in personal care products like [[soap]]s and lotions as well as in the medical field, for which it was originally developed.<ref>"Anti-bacterial personal hygiene products may not be worth potential risks." UC Davis Health System Feature Story: Anti-bacterial personal hygiene products.... UC Davis Health System, n.d. Web. 12 Mar. 2014. <http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/welcome/features/20080903_anti-bacterial/>.</ref> Studies on its antibacterial qualities and mechanisms are growing. Research suggests that it is similar in its mechanism to [[triclosan]] and is effective in fighting infections by targeting the growth of bacteria such as ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''. Additional research seeks to understand its potential for causing antibacterial resistance and its effects on organismal and environmental health.

==Uses==
Triclocarban has been used as an [[antimicrobial]] and [[antifungal medication|antifungal]] compound since the 1960s.<ref name="pmid=21131331">{{cite journal |author1=Orsi Mario |author2=Noro Massimo |author3=Essex Jonathan | year = 2010 | title = Dual-resolution molecular dynamics simulation of antimicrobials in biomembranes | journal = Journal of The Royal Society Interface | volume = 8 | issue = 59| pages = 826–841 | pmc=3104353 | pmid=21131331 | doi=10.1098/rsif.2010.0541}}</ref> It is commonly found in personal care products as an antimicrobial in soaps, lotions, deodorants, toothpaste, and plastic.<ref name="ac.els-cdn.com">{{cite journal |author1=Brausch John |author2=Rand Gary | year = 2011 | title = A review of personal care products in the aquatic environment: Environmental concentrations and toxicity | url = | journal = Chemosphere | volume = 82 | issue = 11| pages = 1518–1532 | doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2010.11.018}}</ref> About 80% of all antimicrobial bar soap sold in the United States contains triclocarban.<ref name="pmid=21131331"/> Additionally, the United States spends nearly 1 billion dollars annually on products containing triclocarban and triclosan.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">{{cite journal | author = Ahn, Chang Ki, Zhao Bin, Gee Shirley, Hammock Bruce, Chen Jiangang, Cherednichenko Gennady, Sanmarti Enio, Denison Michael, Lasley Bill, Pessah Isaac, Kultz Dietmar, Chang Daniel | year = 2008 | title = In Vitro Biologic Activities of the Antimicrobials Triclocarban, Its Analogs, and Triclosan in Bioassay Screens: Receptor-Based Bioassay Screens | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 116 | issue = 9| pages = 1203–1210 | pmc=2535623 | pmid=18795164 | doi=10.1289/ehp.11200}}</ref>

In December 2013, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] required all companies to prove within the next year, that triclocarban is not harmful to consumers. In recent years, companies like [[Johnson & Johnson]], [[Procter & Gamble]], [[Colgate-Palmolive]], and [[Avon Products|Avon]] have begun phasing out chemical use due to health concerns.<ref>Westervelt, Amy, http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/avon-remove-triclosan-product-cosmetic-chemicals</ref>

==Chemical structure and properties==
Triclocarban, 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)urea, is a white powder that is insoluble in water. While triclocarban has two chlorinated phenyl rings, it is structurally similar to carbanilide compounds often found in [[pesticides]] (such as [[diuron]]) and some drugs. Chlorination of ring structures is often associated with hydrophobicity, persistence in the environment, and bioaccumulation in fatty tissues of living organisms. For this reason, chlorine is also a common component of [[persistent organic pollutants]].<ref>"How Do the Partitioning Properties of Polyhalogenated POPs Change When Chlorine Is Replaced with Bromine?" Environmental Science and Technology. Print. 27 April 2014. <http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es8002348.</ref> Triclocarban is incompatible with strong oxidizing reagents and strong bases, reaction with which could result in safety concerns such as explosion, toxicity, gas, and heat.<ref>"Triclocarban."

===Synthesis of triclocarban===
There are two commercial routes used for the production of triclocarban, using the reaction of [[isocyanate]]s with [[nucleophiles]] such as [[amines]] to form [[urea]]s:<ref name=Ullmann>Christian Six, Frank Richter "Isocyanates, Organic" in ''Ulmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a14_611}}</ref>
#4-chlorophenylisocyanate is reacted with [[3,4-dichloroaniline]]
#[[3,4-dichlorophenylisocyanate]] is reacted with [[4-chloroaniline]] 
The purity specification in the draft USP monograph for triclocarban is: not less than 97.0% w/w. The purity of commercial production is greater, 98% w/w.<ref>"High Production Volume (HPV) Chemical Challenge Program Data Availability and Screening Level Assessment for Triclocarban." EPA. Web. 17 Feb. 2014. <http://www.epa.gov/hpv/pubs/summaries/tricloca/c14186tp.pdf</ref>

==Mechanism of action==

===Bacteria===
Triclocarban is predominantly active against [[gram positive]] bacteria (bacteria with a thick [[peptidoglycan wall]]). The precise mechanism of action of triclocarban is unknown, but it is shown to be bacteriostatic, which prevents bacterial proliferation.  Unlike other antibacterial compounds, triclocarban does not interfere with the membrane.  As a result, it is hypothesized that triclocarban’s molecular mechanism resembles that of [[triclosan]], which inhibits bacterial [[Fatty acid metabolism#Synthesis|fatty acid synthesis]].<ref name="pmid=21131331"/><ref name="pmid10196195">{{cite journal |vauthors=Heath RJ, Rubin JR, Holland DR, Zhang E, Snow ME, Rock CO |title=Mechanism of triclosan inhibition of bacterial fatty acid synthesis |journal=J. Biol. Chem. |volume=274 |issue=16 |pages=11110–4 |date=April 1999 |pmid=10196195 |doi=10.1074/jbc.274.16.11110}}</ref>  By mimicking the natural substrate of the enoyl-acyl-carrier protein reductase (ENR) enzyme, triclosan acts as a site-directed inhibitor and disrupts lipid, phospholipid, lipopolysaccharide and lipoprotein synthesis.  ENR is a highly conserved enzyme of lipid biosynthetic pathways in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and mycobacterial species and is absent in humans.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://femsle.oxfordjournals.org/content/202/1/1|title = Triclosan: a widely used biocide and its link to antibiotics|last = Schweizer|first = Herbert|date = August 1, 2001|journal = FEMS Microbiology Letters|doi = 10.1111/j.1574-6968.2001.tb10772.x|access-date = February 7, 2015|volume=202|pages=1–7}}</ref>

===Humans===
The specific mechanism of action for triclocarban's health effects on humans, like in bacteria, is unclear. Generally, triclocarban enhances the gene expression of other steroid hormones, including androgens, estrogens, and cortisol. It is hypothesized that the compound acts similar to [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]]s or coactivators that modulate the activity of [[estrogen receptor]]s and [[androgen receptors]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chang CY, McDonnell DP | year = 2005 | title = Androgen receptor-cofactor interactions as targets for new drug discovery | url = | journal = Trends Pharmacol. Sci. | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 225–228 | doi = 10.1016/j.tips.2005.03.002 | pmid = 15860367 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=McDonnell DP, Norris JD | year = 2002 | title = Connections and regulation of the human estrogen receptor | url = | journal = Science | volume = 296 | issue = | pages = 1642–1644 | doi = 10.1126/science.1071884 | pmid = 12040178 }}</ref> Experiments show that triclocarban activates [[constitutive androstane receptor]] and [[estrogen receptor alpha]] both ''in vivo'' and ''in vitro'' and might have the potential to alter normal physiological homeostasis. Activation of these receptors amplifies gene expression and, in doing so, may be the mechanistic base of triclocarban's health impact on humans. However, further investigation is needed to determine whether triclocarban increases the activity of sex steroid hormones by binding to the receptors or by binding to and sensitizing the receptor coactivators.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Yueh|first1=Mei-Fei|last2=Li|first2=Tao|last3=Evans|first3=Ronald M.|last4=Hammock|first4=Bruce|last5=Tukey|first5=Robert H.|last6=Appanna|first6=Vasu D.|display-authors=2|title=Triclocarban Mediates Induction of Xenobiotic Metabolism through Activation of the Constitutive Androstane Receptor and the Estrogen Receptor Alpha|journal=PLoS ONE|date=15 June 2012|volume=7|issue=6|pages=e37705|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0037705|pmc=3376094|pmid=22761658}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Jiangang|last2=Ahn|first2=Ki Chang|last3=Gee|first3=Nancy A.|last4=Ahmed|first4=Mohamed I.|last5=Duleba|first5=Antoni J.|last6=Zhao|first6=Ling|last7=Gee|first7=Shirley J.|last8=Hammock|first8=Bruce D.|last9=Lasley|first9=Bill L.|display-authors=3|title=Triclocarban Enhances Testosterone Action: A New Type of Endocrine Disruptor?|journal=Endocrinology|date=March 2008|volume=149|issue=3|pages=1173–1179|doi=10.1210/en.2007-1057|pmid=18048496|pmc=2275366}}</ref>

==Antibacterial properties==
Triclocarban acts to effectively treat both initial bacterial skin and mucosal infections as well as those infections at risk for [[superinfection]]. ''In vitro'', triclocarban has been found to be effective against various strains of ''staphylococcus'', ''streptococcus'', and ''enterococcus'' bacteria. It has been shown to be effective as an antibacterial even at very low levels. Triclocarban’s [[minimum inhibitory concentration]] has been found to range from 0.5 to 8&nbsp;mg/L for these various strains.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Drugeon H.B. |author2=Rouveix B. |author3=Michaud-Nerard A. | year = 2012 | title = Triclocarban antibacterial activity on resistant staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci | url = | journal = Medecine et Maladies Infectieuses | volume = 42 | issue = 6| pages = 276–279 | doi = 10.1016/j.medmal.2012.04.004 | pmid = 22626523 }}</ref> Triclocarban is only unquestionably bacteriostatic for gram-positive bacteria such as ''Staphylococcus aureus'', which suggests that the mechanism of triclocarban’s antibacterial activity is through its destabilization of bacterial cell walls.<ref name="pmid=21131331"/>

===Resistance===
Exposure of organisms like fish, algae, and humans to low levels of triclocarban and other antibacterial chemicals kills weak microbes and allows the stronger, resistant strains to proliferate. As microbes [[horizontal gene transfer|share genes]], an increase in resistant strains increases the probability that weak microbes acquire these resistance genes. The consequence is a new colony of drug resistant microbes.<ref name="Son, Ahjeong 2010">{{cite journal |author1=Son Ahjeong |author2=Kennedy Ian |author3=Scow Kate |author4=Hristova Krassimira | year = 2010 | title = Quantitative gene monitoring of microbial tetracycline resistance using magnetic luminescent nanoparticles | journal = Journal of Environmental Monitoring | volume = 12 | issue = 6| pages = 1362–1367 | pmc=3267904 | pmid=20424797 | doi=10.1039/c001974g}}</ref>

When resistant microbes are exposed to antimicrobials, they increase their expression of genes that confer this resistance. The risk of bacterial [[antibiotic resistance]] has been studied by quantitatively monitoring the abundance of the tetQ gene in wastewater microcosms. As tetQ is the most common resistance gene in the environment and encodes for ribosomal protection proteins, the amount that it expresses correlates with the amount of resistance in a microbial population. The addition of triclocarban was shown to increase the expression of this tetQ gene.<ref name="Son, Ahjeong 2010"/>

TetQ gene expression in bacteria was also found to be significantly increased when multiple antimicrobials such as tetracycline, triclosan, and triclocarban were added to an experimental system at the same time. Combining these compounds affects resistance by creating a situation where co-selection (or [[natural selection]] by more than one reagent) for resistance genes occurs. The complex nature of microbial communities and the multitude of antibiotics present in aquatic environments often leads to this sort of dynamic selection event and the multiple resistance patterns seen in naturally occurring bacteria.<ref name="Son, Ahjeong 2010"/>

==Breakdown of product==
When triclocarban is manufactured, 139 toxic, carcinogenic byproducts, such as 4-chloroaniline and 3,4-dichloroaniline, are released. More of these carcinogens can be released upon chemical, physical and biological attack of triclocarban.<ref name="pubs.acs.org"/> The duration of triclocarban chemical in personal product use is relatively short.  Upon disposal, the triclocarban is washed down the drain to municipal [[wastewater treatment plants]], where about 97-98% of triclocarban is removed from the water.

Discharge of effluent from these treatment plants and disposal of sludge on land is the primary route of environmental exposure to triclocarban. Research shows that triclocarban and triclosan have been detected in sewage effluents and [[sludge]] (biosolids) due to their incomplete removal during wastewater treatment.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 2684649 | pmid=20046971 | doi=10.1111/j.1752-1688.2008.00284.x | volume=45 | title=Environmental Exposure of Aquatic and Terrestrial Biota to Triclosan and Triclocarban | year=2009 | journal=J Am Water Works Assoc | pages=4–13 |vauthors=Chalew TE, Halden RU }}</ref> Due to their hydrophobic nature, significant amounts of them in wastewater streams partition into sludge, with concentrations at mg/kg levels. The volume of triclocarban reentering the environment in sewage sludge after initial successful capture from wastewater is s 127,000 ± 194,000&nbsp;kg/yr. This is equivalent to a 4.8 – 48.2% of its total U.S consumption volume. Crops shown to take up antimicrobials from soil include barley, meadow fescue, carrots and pinto beans.<ref name="pubs.acs.org"/> Studies show that substantial quantities of triclocarban (227,000 – 454,000&nbsp;kg/y) can break through wastewater treatment plants and damage algae on surface waters.<ref name="pubs.acs.org"/>

==Environmental concerns==
{{see also|Environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products}}

===Waste water===
High concentrations of triclocarban may be found in [[wastewater]]. It is among the top ten most commonly detected organic wastewater compounds in terms of frequency and concentration. Triclocarban has been found in increasing concentrations over the past five years and is now more frequently detected than [[triclosan]].<ref name="ac.els-cdn.com"/>

===Wildlife toxicity===
Triclocarban has a [[hazard quotient]] rating of greater than one. Hazard quotients greater than one indicate the potential for adverse effects on organisms due to toxicity.<ref name="ac.els-cdn.com"/> As triclocarban is found in high concentrations in aquatic environments, there are concerns regarding its toxicity to aquatic species. Specifically, triclocarban has been shown to be toxic to amphibians, fish, invertebrates, and aquatic plants, and traces of the compound have been found in Atlantic dolphins.<ref name="ac.els-cdn.com"/><ref name="nrdc.org">http://www.nrdc.org/living/chemicalindex/triclosan.asp</ref> The antibacterial components of triclocarban may disrupt hormones critical to the developmental and endocrine processes in exposed animal wildlife. The [[neurological]] and [[reproductive]] systems are particularly affected through contact with this compound. Triclocarban may also affect animal wildlife behavior.<ref name="nrdc.org"/> For example, triclosan and triclocarban are 100-1,000 times more effective in inhibiting and killing algae, crustaceans and fish than they are in killing microbes. Triclocarban and triclosan have been observed in multiple organisms, including algae, aquatic blackworms, fish, and dolphins.<ref name="pubs.acs.org">Halden, Rolf U. "On the Need and Speed of Regulating Triclosan and Triclocarban in the United States." Environmental science & technology (2014). http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es500495p</ref>

===Bioaccumulation===
Triclocarban [[bioaccumulation]] is possible in a number of organisms. Earthworms are known to store this chemical in their bodies and, because of their ecological role as a food source, they have the potential to move triclocarban up the food chain.<ref name="Higgins, Christopher 2011">{{cite journal |author1=Higgins Christopher |author2=Paesani Zachary |author3=Chalew Talia |author4=Halden Rolf |author5=Hundal Lakhwinder | year = 2011 | title = Persistence of triclocarban and triclosan in soils after land application of biosolids and bioaccumulation in Eisenia foetida | journal = Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 556–563 | doi = 10.1002/etc.416 | pmid = 21128266 | pmc=3034821}}</ref> Microbial species found in soils also bioaccumulate triclocarban.

Bioaccumulation does occur in plants treated with water containing triclocarban. However, it is estimated that less than 0.5% of the acceptable daily intake of triclocarban for humans is represented by vegetable consumption. Thus, the concentration of triclocarban in edible portions of plants is a negligible exposure pathway for humans.

The potential for triclocarban to bioaccumulate in plants has been exploited in the construction of wetlands meant to help remove triclocarban from wastewater. These [[constructed wetlands]] are considered a cost-effective treatment option for the removal of [[PPCPs]], including triclocarban and triclosan, from domestic water effluent. Such compounds tend to concentrate in the roots of wetland plants. Potential ecological risks associated with this method are the decrease of root systems in wetland plants, reduced nutrient uptake, decreased competitive ability, and increased potential for uprooting. Due to these risks, the long term exposure of wetland ecosystems to wastewater containing triclocarban as a major solution to wastewater pollution is still under discussion.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Zarate Frederick |author2=Schulwitz Sarah |author3=Stevens Kevin |author4=Venables Barney | year = 2012 | title = Bioconcentration of triclosan, methyl-triclosan, and triclocarban in the plants and sediments of a constructed wetland | url = | journal = Chemosphere | volume = 88 | issue = 3| pages = 323–329 | doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.03.005 | pmid=22483729}}</ref>

==Health concerns==

===Personal care===
One study has investigated how triclocarban remains in the human system after using a bar of soap with traces of triclocarban. Analysis of urine samples from human test subjects shows that, after triclocarban has undergone [[glucuronidation]], its oxidative metabolites are less readily excreted than triclocarban itself. This same study performed [[topical medication|topical]] treatments of triclocarban on rats and, by analyzing urine and plasma levels, demonstrated that triclocarban does remain in the organism's system.<ref name="Schebb, Nils Helge 2011">{{cite journal | author = Schebb, Helge Nils, Inceoglu Bora, Chang Ahn Ki, Morisseau Christophe, Gee Shirley, Hammock Bruce | year = 2011 | title = Investigation of Human Exposure to Triclocarban after Showering and Preliminary Evaluation of Its Biological Effects | url = | journal = Environmental Science & Technology | volume = 45 | issue = 7| pages = 3109–3115 | pmid = 21381656 | doi=10.1021/es103650m | pmc=3470465}}</ref>

=== Endocrine disorders===
Triclocarban induces weak responses mediated by [[aryl hydrocarbon]], [[estrogen]], and [[androgen receptors]] ''in vitro''.

While triclocarban causes endocrine disruption, its chemical toxicity with respect to lethality is low ({{LD50}} >5000&nbsp;mg/kg). Its rate of skin absorption is also low.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Marty J. P. |author2=Wepierre J. | year = 1979 | title = Toxicity evaluation of cosmetically active substances: case of trichlorocarbanilide | url = | journal = Labo-Pharma - Problemes et Techniques | volume = 27 | issue = 286| pages = 306–10 }}</ref> Repeated low-dose exposure, however, can cause endocrine disruption over time.

===Allergies===
Triclocarban causes irritation of the lungs, eyes, and skin. Canada and Japan restrict the content of triclocarban in cosmetics.<ref>"Triclocarban." EWG's Skin Deep® Cosmetics Database. Web. 17 Feb. 2014. <http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/706622/TRICLOCARBAN/>.</ref> Triclocarban may also cause sensitization to [[aeroallergen]]s and food.<ref name="pubs.acs.org"/>

==Safety==
Spillage may increase the risk of human, ecological, and environmental exposure to triclocarban. Immediate removal and restraint of the spill, including triclocarban as dust, is urged.<ref name="datasheets.scbt.com"/>  
Although triclocarban has few to no direct detrimental effects on health aside from allergic reactions, preventing exposure to triclocarban is recommended. Since triclocarban enters the body through pores, wearing gloves, properly washing hands, and overall proper hygiene reduces the risk of skin exposure and irritation.
High concentrations of triclocarban dust may remain in the lungs and inhibit lung and respiratory function. For individuals with prior respiratory conditions, triclocarban exacerbates the severity of respiratory diseases, and proper protection is recommended as a precaution. 
In case of exposure to triclocarban, the individual is suggested to wash the area with water or to clear the respiratory pathways.<ref name="datasheets.scbt.com"/> 
In addition to its adverse effects on humans and the environment, solid triclocarban is a fire hazard. It is particularly combustible as dust. Contamination with other oxidizing agents may also result in combustion.<ref name="datasheets.scbt.com"/>

==Policy==
In light of the difficulties of finding antimicrobial alternatives, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] began in the 1970s to review the safety of triclocarban and [[triclosan]], but no enacted policy, or "drug monograph," is available to date.<ref name="pubs.acs.org"/> Legal recourse by the Natural Resources Defense Council in 2010 forced the FDA to review triclocarban and [[triclosan]].<ref name="pubs.acs.org"/> However, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] maintains regulatory control over triclocarban and [[triclosan]] to date.<ref name="pubs.acs.org"/>

On September 2, 2016, the Food and Drug Administration announced that triclosan and triclocarban must be removed from all antibacterial soap products by late 2017.<ref>{{cite news|title=Antibacterial soap soon to disappear|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/09/02/antibacterial-soap-soon-disappear/89774728/|accessdate=3 September 2016|publisher=USA Today}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Antibacterial Soap? You Can Skip It -- Use Plain Soap and Water|url=http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm378393.htm|website=FDA.gov|accessdate=3 September 2016}}</ref>  Similar in its use and its adverse health impacts as [[triclosan]], [[hexachlorophene]] became prohibited by the FDA.<ref name="pubs.acs.org"/>

==Current and future research==
The future of triclocarban is unknown, but scientists are searching for more sustainable antimicrobials that maintain its antibacterial properties while being minimally toxic to the environment, humans, and wildlife.  This entails low degrees of bioaccumulation and rapid, clean biodegradation in existing wastewater treatment facilities. A lowered potential or no potential for resistance is also preferable.<ref name="pubs.acs.org"/> These next generation chemicals should aim to act on a broad spectrum of microbes and pathogens while also being minimally toxic and bioaccumulating in non-target species.

Synthesis of these compounds could be improved upon by finding renewable sources for their production that lacks occupational hazards.<ref name="pubs.acs.org"/> Research regarding the sustainability of chemical production is currently being used to help formulate green pharmaceuticals. These same principles may be applied to the development of improved antimicrobials.<ref name="pubs.acs.org"/> Development in this area would benefit both people and the environment.<ref name="pubs.acs.org"/>
