'''Bertilimumab''' is a [[human]] [[monoclonal antibody]] that binds to [[eotaxin-1]], an important regulator of overall [[eosinophil]] function.

It was discovered by [[Cambridge Antibody Technology]] using their [[phage display]] technology.<ref>http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/319/3/1395</ref> Named CAT-213 during early discovery and development by CAT, it was to be used to treat severe allergic disorders.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=15573873 | volume=5 | issue=11 | title=Bertilimumab Cambridge Antibody Technology Group |date=November 2004 | pages=1213â€“8}}</ref>

In January 2007, CAT licensed the drug for treatment of allergy disorders to iCo Therapeutics Inc.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icotherapeutics.com/site/investor-relations/cambridge_antibody_tech_licenses_monoclonal_antibody_treatment_allergy/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501222201/http://www.icotherapeutics.com/site/investor-relations/cambridge_antibody_tech_licenses_monoclonal_antibody_treatment_allergy/ |archivedate=2009-05-01 |df= }}</ref> iCo Therapeutics Inc. is a Vancouver-based reprofiling company focused on redosing or reformulating drugs with clinical history for new or expanded indications - a so-called 'search and development company'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icotherapeutics.com/site/corporate_overview/overview/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728050145/http://www.icotherapeutics.com/site/corporate_overview/overview/ |archivedate=2009-07-28 |df= }}</ref>

iCo Therapeutics Inc. renamed the drug from CAT-213 to iCo-008 and, at that stage, planned to initiate a Phase II clinical trial in patients with vernal [[keratoconjunctivitis]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icotherapeutics.com/site/pipeline/ico008/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728131313/http://www.icotherapeutics.com/site/pipeline/ico008/ |archivedate=2009-07-28 |df= }}</ref>

In March 2008, iCo announced iCo-008 had been in 126 patients in Phase I and II clinical trials. The drug substance had been manufactured by [[Lonza Group|Lonza]], in its cGMP facilities in [[Slough]], [[UK]]. Subsequently, iCo moved the drug substance to a fill-finish site for the final stage of manufacturing. iCo reported that the iCo-008 drug product was within specifications and contained a high antibody yield.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icotherapeutics.com/site/investor-relations/ico_therapeutics_provides_ico_008_phase_ii_clinical_update/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501230056/http://www.icotherapeutics.com/site/investor-relations/ico_therapeutics_provides_ico_008_phase_ii_clinical_update/ |archivedate=2009-05-01 |df= }}</ref>

In June 2011, IMMUNE Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: IMNP) <ref>http://immunepharmaceuticals.com/</ref> ([[Herzliya, Israel]]) in-licensed Bertilimumab from iCo for non-ophthalmic indications.<ref>http://immunepharmaceuticals.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=32&Itemid=20</ref> IMMUNE is initiating Phase II clinical trials of Bertilimumab in [[inflammatory bowel disease]] ([[ulcerative colitis]] & [[Crohn's disease]]) in 2015 and 2016. Other indications planned for Bertilimumab development include severe asthma and liver disease (NASH).
