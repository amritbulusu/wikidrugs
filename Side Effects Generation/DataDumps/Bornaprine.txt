==Pharmacodynamics==
[[File:Bornaprine.Pathway.jpg|thumb|Bornaprine Pathway]]
Bornaprine is an [[antimuscarinic]] agent that nonselectively antagonizes [[muscarinic]] [[acetylcholine receptors]], [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1|M1]] and [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2|M2]].<ref name="Kreiskott">{{cite book|title=Das Parkinson-Syndrom|chapter=Neuere pharmakologische Aspekte zu den zentralen Anticholinergika Biperiden und|last1=Kreiskott|first1=H|last2=Kretzschmar|first2=R|year=1985|pages=277–87|language=German}}</ref> Bornaprine has been characterized as a very [[potency (pharmacology)|potent]] anticholinergic medication and further [[clinical trials]] have indicated its effectiveness at treating [[parkinsonian tremors]].<ref name="Ascher">{{Cite journal | pmid = 790774| year = 1976| author1 = Ascher| first1 = P.

==Pharmacokinetics==
===Absorption===
Bornaprine is successfully [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorbed]] into the [[Blood plasma|plasma]] of [[humans]] within 1–2 hours after an [[oral administration|oral]] [[dose (biochemistry)|dose]].<ref name="Mayo">{{Cite journal | pmid = 7210700| year = 1980| author1 = Mayo| first1 = B.

A.}}</ref> Additional oral doses of bornaprine resulted in some accumulation in the plasma.<ref name="Mayo"/>

===Excretion===
Single oral doses of bornaprine were successfully [[excreted]] in urine and feces in [[rats]], [[dogs]], and humans.<ref name="Mayo"/> The following mean excretion rates were also reported during five days for urine and feces: rat 31 and 70%, dog 53 and 39%, and humans 78 and 4%.<ref name="Mayo"/> Excretion was notably prolonged and incomplete at five days in humans, indicating a longer half life and metabolism rate of bornaprine for humans.<ref name="Mayo"/> In human subjects, bornaprine has a half life of approximately 30 hours compared to 5 and 12 hour half lives in rats and dogs, respectively.<ref name="Mayo"/>

===Metabolites===
Bornaprine is an epimeric mixture of [[Endo-exo isomerism|exo and endo]] [[esters]], and its major [[metabolites]] have been identified and include: three [[isomers]] of monohydroxy-N-desthel-Sormodren, three isomers of monohydroxy-Sormodren and 5-hydroxyl.<ref name="Mayo"/> Each of these metabolites were hydroxylated at either C-5 or C-6 in the bicyclic ring.<ref name="Elmarakby">{{Cite journal | pmid = 3735109| year = 1986| author1 = Elmarakby| first1 = S. A.| title = Microbial metabolism of bornaprine, 3-(diethylamino)propyl 2-phenylbicyclo2.2.1heptane-2-carboxylate| journal = Journal of pharmaceutical sciences| volume = 75| issue = 6| pages = 614–8| last2 = Clark| first2 = A. M.| last3 = Baker| first3 = J. K.| last4 = Hufford| first4 = C. D. | doi=10.1002/jps.2600750620}}</ref> The activity of each of [[Chemical compound|compound]]s has been studied extensively and 5-hydroxyl showed similar anticholinergic activity to the parent compound when tested in isolated rat atrium unlike other identified meatabolites.<ref name="Hufford"/>

==Availability==
Bornaprine is currently available under the brand name Sormodrem in the following countries: Austria ([[Abbott Pharmaceuticals]]), Germany (Abbott), Italy (Teofarma Pharmaceuticals), and Turkey (Abbott). Bornaprine is normally administered in a [[tablet (pharmacy)|tablet]] form, however a recent [[patent]] is investigating the effect of several anticholinergic drugs, including bornaprine, in transdermal [[Transdermal patch|patch]]es. These patches are not currently available to the public market.<ref name="patent"/> Bornaprine is not currently on the market in the United States and its clinical trial status is unknown.

==Treatment==

===Parkinson's Disease===
Like many other anticholinergic drugs, bornaprine had been used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Bornaprine most effectively treats the tremors associated with Parkinson's and also helps [[bradykinesia]], [[hypokinesia]], and [[Human position|posture]] and [[facial expression]].<ref name="Cantello"/>

===Hyperhidrosis===
[[Hyperhidrosis]] occurs in acute phase of [[spinal cord]] injured patients and an effective oral treatment for hyperhidrosis has yet to be perfected.<ref name="Sergi"/> A recent study done with patients with [[medulla oblongata|medullary]] [[lesions]] found bornaprine to be very effective in decreasing the amount of [[sweating]] in patients with minimal [[side-effects]].<ref name="Sergi"/> Bornaprine is now commonly [[prescribed]] for treating hyperhidrosis in [[Europe]].

===Sleep=== 
When administered to healthy humans, bornaprine suppressed the amount of [[REM sleep]], suggesting that the M1 and M2 receptors are involved in [[sleep]] increase and REM latency.<ref name="Hohagen"/> This also suggests that bornaprine may be able to be used as a [[sleep aid]] in the future.<ref name="Hohagen"/>

==Side Effects== 
Since bornaprine is a potent anticholinergic drug, it has a similar side effect profile to other anticholinergic drugs, including [[dry mouth]] and [[constipation]].<ref name= "Bergamasco">{{Cite journal | pmid = 4058785| year = 1985| author1 = Bergamasco| first1 = B| title = Preliminary open multicenter study on the anti-tremorigenic effectiveness of bornaprine (Sormodren)| journal = Minerva medica| volume = 76| issue = 40| pages = 1877–81| last2 = Cantello| first2 = R| last3 = Delsedime| first3 = M| last4 = Gilli| first4 = M| last5 = Riccio| first5 = A| last6 = Aguggia| first6 = M}}</ref><ref name="Cantello"/> Additionally, when bornaprine was administered to patients with secondary parkinsonism, few patients reported transient [[confusion]].<ref name="Sancesario"/>

==Toxicity== 
[[LD50]] tests performed on [[rodents]] revealed that 26&nbsp;mg/kg intravenously and 112&nbsp;mg/kg subcutaneously administered amounts of bornaprine were [[toxic]].<ref name="NLM">{{cite web |url=http://www.nih.gov/chemidplus/rn/20448-86-6 |title=Bornaprine|website= United States National Library of Medicine |publisher= National Institute of Health |accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref> Subcutaneous application resulted in [[ataxia]], [[spastic]] [[paralysis]], and [[convulsions]].<ref name="NLM"/>
