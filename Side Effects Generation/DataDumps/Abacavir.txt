== Medical uses ==
[[Image:Abacavir (Ziagen) 300mg.jpg|thumb|Two Abacavir 300mg tablets]]
Abacavir tablets and oral solution, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, are indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.

Abacavir should always be used in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Abacavir should not be added as a single agent when antiretroviral regimens are changed due to loss of virologic response.

==Side effects==
Common adverse reactions include nausea, headache, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite and trouble sleeping. Rare but serious side effects include hypersensitivity reaction or rash, elevated AST and ALT, depression, anxiety, fever/chills, URI, lactic acidosis, hypertriglyceridemia, and lipodystrophy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://online.epocrates.com/noFrame/showPage.do?method=drugs&MonographId=2043&ActiveSectionId=5|title=Abacavir Adverse Reactions|last=|first=|date=|website=Epocrates Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}</ref>

People with liver disease should be cautious about using abacavir because it can aggravate the condition. Signs of liver problems include nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, dark-colored urine and yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes. The use of [[nucleoside]] drugs such as abacavir can very rarely cause [[lactic acidosis]]. Signs of lactic acidosis include fast or irregular heartbeat, unusual muscle pain, fatigue, difficulty breathing and stomach pain with nausea and vomiting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/drugs/257/abacavir/0/patient/|title=Abacavir {{!}} Dosage, Side Effects {{!}} AIDSinfo|website=AIDSinfo|access-date=2016-11-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170306063920/https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/drugs/257/abacavir/0/patient|archivedate=2017-03-06|df=}}</ref> Abacavir can also lead to immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, a change in body fat as well as an increased risk of heart attack.

Resistance to abacavir has developed in laboratory versions of HIV which are also resistant to other HIV-specific antiretrovirals such as [[lamivudine]], [[didanosine]] and [[zalcitabine]]. HIV strains that are resistant to [[protease inhibitors]] are not likely to be resistant to abacavir.

Abacavir is contraindicated for use in infants under 3 months of age.

Little is known about the effects of Abacavir overdose. Overdose victims should be taken to a hospital emergency room for treatment.

===Hypersensitivity syndrome===
[[Hypersensitivity]] to abacavir is strongly associated with a specific allele at the [[human leukocyte antigen]] B [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] namely [[HLA-B57|HLA-B*5701]].<ref>{{cite journal | last=Mallal | first=S., Phillips, E., Carosi, G. | title=HLA-B*5701 screening for hypersensitivity to abacavir | journal=New England Journal of Medicine | year=2008 | volume=358 | issue=6 | pages=568–579 | doi=10.1056/nejmoa0706135 | pmid=18256392 | display-authors=et al.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last=Rauch | first=A., Nolan, D., Martin, A. | title=Prospective genetic screening decreases the incidence of abacavir hypersensitivity reactions in the Western Australian HIV cohort study | journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases | year=2006 | volume=43 | issue=1 | pages=99–102 | doi=10.1086/504874 | pmid=16758424 | display-authors=et al.}}</ref> There is an association between the prevalence of HLA-B*5701 and ancestry.

[[File:Epikutanni-test.jpg|thumb|[[Patch test]]]]

[[Patch test|Skin-patch testing]] may also be used to determine whether an individual will experience a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, although some patients susceptible to developing AHS may not react to the patch test.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Shear | first=N.H., Milpied, B., Bruynzeel, D.

The development of suspected hypersensitivity reactions to abacavir requires immediate and permanent discontinuation of abacavir therapy in all patients, including patients who do not possess the HLA-B*5701 allele. On March 1, 2011, the FDA informed the public about an ongoing safety review of abacavir and a possible increased risk of heart attack associated with the drug. A [[meta-analysis]] of 26 studies conducted by the FDA, however, did not find any association between abacavir use and heart attack <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.drugs.com/fda/abacavir-ongoing-safety-review-possible-increased-risk-heart-attack-12914.html|title=FDA Alert: Abacavir - Ongoing Safety Review: Possible Increased Risk of Heart Attack|last=|first=|date=|work=Drugs.com|access-date=2013-11-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210144028/http://www.drugs.com/fda/abacavir-ongoing-safety-review-possible-increased-risk-heart-attack-12914.html|archive-date=2013-12-10|dead-url=no|language=en-US|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors=Ding X, Andraca-Carrera E, Cooper C | title=No association of abacavir use with myocardial infarction: findings of an FDA meta-analysis | journal=J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. | volume=61 | issue=4 | pages=441–7 | date=December 2012 | pmid=22932321 | doi=10.1097/QAI.0b013e31826f993c | display-authors=et al.}}</ref>

===Immunopathogenesis===
The mechanism underlying abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome is related to the change in the HLA-B*5701 [[protein]] product. Abacavir binds with high specificity to the HLA-B*5701 protein, changing the shape and chemistry of the antigen-binding cleft. This results in a change in [[Immune tolerance|immunological tolerance]] and the subsequent activation of abacavir-specific [[cytotoxic T cell]]s, which produce a systemic reaction known as abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Illing | first1 = PT | display-authors = etal   | year = 2012 | title = Immune self-reactivity triggered by drug-modified HLA-peptide repertoire| url = | journal = Nature| volume =  486| issue = | pages =  554–8| doi = 10.1038/nature11147 | pmid=22722860}}</ref>

== Interaction ==
Abacavir, and in general [[Reverse-transcriptase inhibitor|NRTIs]], do not undergo hepatic metabolism and therefore have very limited (to none) interaction with the CYP enzymes and drugs that effect these enzymes. That being said there are still few interactions that can affect the absorption or the availability of abacavir. Below are few of the common established drug and food interaction that can take place during abacavir co-administration:

*[[Protease inhibitors]] such as [[tipranavir]] or [[ritonovir]] may decrease the serum concentration of abacavir through induction of glucuronidation. Abacavir is metabolized by both alcohol dehydrogenase and glucuronidation.<ref name=":3">Prescribing information. Ziagen (abacavir).

Columbus, OH: Roxane Laboratories, Inc.; March 2015.</ref>
*[[Orlistat]] may decrease the serum concentration of Antiretroviral Agents.

*[[Cabozantinib]]: Drugs from the MPR2 inhibitor (Multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 inhibitors) family such as abacavir could increase the serum concentration of Cabozantinib.<ref>Cometriq (cabozantinib) [prescribing information]. South San Francisco, CA: Exelixis, Inc.; May 2016.</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==
Abacavir is a [[Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor|nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor]] that inhibits [[viral replication]]. It is a [[guanosine]] analogue that is phosphorylated to carbovir triphosphate (CBV-TP). CBV-TP competes with the viral molecules and is incorporated  into the viral [[DNA]]. Once CBV-TP is integrated into the viral DNA, [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[HIV reverse transcriptase]] is inhibited.<ref name=":2">Product Information: ZIAGEN(R) oral tablets, oral solution, abacavir sulfate oral tablets, oral solution. ViiV Healthcare (per Manufacturer), Research Triangle Park, NC, 2015.</ref>

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Abacavir is given orally and is rapidly absorbed with a high [[bioavailability]] of 83%. Solution and tablet have comparable  concentrations and bioavailability. Abacavir can be taken with or without food.

Abacavir can cross the [[Blood–brain barrier|blood-brain barrier]]. Abacavir is metabolized primarily through the enzymes [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] and [[Glucuronosyltransferase|glucuronyl transferase]] to an inactive [[carboxylate]] and [[glucuronide]] metabolites. It has a [[Half-life|half life]] of approximately 1.5-2.0 hours. If a person has [[liver failure]], abacavir’s half life is increased by 58%.

Abacavir is eliminated via excretion in the urine (83%) and feces (16%). It is unclear whether abacavir can be removed by [[hemodialysis]] or [[peritoneal dialysis]].<ref name=":2" />

== History ==
Abacavir was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) on December 18, 1998, and is thus the fifteenth approved antiretroviral drug in the United States. Its patent expired in the United States on 2009-12-26.
