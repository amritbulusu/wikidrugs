'''Motavizumab''' (proposed [[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], trade name '''Numax''') is a [[humanized monoclonal antibody]]. It is being investigated by [[MedImmune]] (today a subsidiary of [[AstraZeneca]]) for the prevention of [[respiratory syncytial virus]] infection in high-risk [[infant]]s. {{As of|September 2009}}, it is undergoing Phase II and III [[clinical trials]].<ref>[http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=motavizumab ClinicalTrials.gov]</ref>

In June 2010, the FDA Antiviral Drugs Advisory Committee declined to endorse MedImmune's request for licensure of Motavizumab in a 14 to 3 decision. The members of that panel cited several reasons for the decision, and many were concerned that "we're not looking at a product that has evidence of superiority in terms of efficacy" when compared to the already available monoclonal antibody Palivizumab.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/722903|title=FDA Panel Nixes Licensing Request for Motavizumab|publisher=Medscape|date=3 June 2010|accessdate=2014-03-02}}</ref>

In December 2010, AstraZeneca in a stock market statement stated that it would be writing down $445m (Â£286m) after discontinuing a key development programme for Motavizumab. The company stated that it would no longer develop Motavizumab for the prevention of [[respiratory syncytial virus]] (RSV), and as a result was withdrawing its licence application to the US [[Food and Drug Administration]]. It added that it would continue to develop Motavizumab for other treatments of RSV.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12047666|title=AstraZeneca halts work on Motavizumab drug|publisher=BBC News|date=21 December 2010|accessdate=2010-12-21}}</ref>
