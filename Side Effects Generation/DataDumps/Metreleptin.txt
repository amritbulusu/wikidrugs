'''Metreleptin''' (trade name '''Myalept''') is a synthetic [[structural analog|analog]] of the hormone [[leptin]] used to treat diabetes and various forms of [[dyslipidemia]].  It has been approved in Japan for metabolic disorders including [[lipodystrophy]] and in the United States as replacement therapy to treat the complications of leptin deficiency, in addition to diet, in patients with congenital generalized or acquired generalized lipodystrophy.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Drugs | year = 2013 | volume = 73 | issue = 9 | pages = 989â€“997 | doi = 10.1007/s40265-013-0074-7 | title = Metreleptin: first global approval | author = Chou K, Perry CM | pmid= 23740412}}</ref>

Metreleptin is currently being investigated for the treatment of diabetes and/or [[hypertriglyceridemia]], in patients with rare forms of lipodystrophy, syndromes characterized by abnormalities in adipose tissue distribution, and severe metabolic abnormalities.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.diabetesincontrol.com/articles/53-/12611-amylin-seeks-fda-approval-for-metreleptin | title = Amylin Seeks FDA Approval for Metreleptin | date = 11 April 2012 | publisher = diabetesincontrol.com}}</ref>FDA approved Metreleptin injection for treating complications of Leptin deficiency in February 2014

In a three-year study of metreleptin in patients with lipodystrophy organized by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, metreleptin treatment was associated with a significant decrease in blood glucose (A1c decreased from 9.4% at baseline to 7.0% at study end) and triglyceride concentration (from 500&nbsp;mg/dl at baseline to 200&nbsp;mg/dl at study end).<ref name="url_Amylin_Pharmaceuticals_Press_Release">{{cite web | url = http://investors.amylin.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=101911&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1550945&highlight | title =Amylin to Present Data Showing Investigational Metreleptin Treatment Led to Long-Term Improvements in Diabetes and Lipid Control in Patients with Lipodystrophy | date = 2011-04-15 | work = Press Release | publisher =  Amylin Pharmaceuticals | accessdate = 2011-10-27 }}</ref>
