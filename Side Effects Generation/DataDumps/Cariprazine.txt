==Medical uses==
Cariprazine is approved for [[schizophrenia]] and [[Mania|manic]] or [[Mixed affective state|mixed]] episodes associated with [[bipolar I disorder]]. It has also been investigated as a potential adjunct in [[Treatment-resistant depression|treatment-resistant]] [[major depressive disorder]].<ref name ="EXO">{{cite journal|title=Cariprazine: chemistry, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism, clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability|journal=Expert Opinion on Drug Metabolism and Toxicology|author=Citrome, L|date=February 2013|volume=9|issue=2|pages=193–206|doi=10.1517/17425255.2013.759211|pmid=23320989}}</ref>

==Side effects==
The most prevalent side effects for cariprazine include [[akathisia]], [[insomnia]], and [[weight gain]]. Cariprazine does not appear to impact metabolic variables or prolactin levels, and unlike many other antipsychotics, does not increase the electrocardiogram (ECG) QT interval. In short term clinical trials extrapyramidal effects, sedation, akathisia, nausea, dizziness, vomiting, anxiety, and constipation were observed. One review characterized the frequency of these events as "not greatly different from that seen in patient treated with placebo"<ref>{{cite journal |author=Citrome L |title=Cariprazine in schizophrenia: clinical efficacy, tolerability, and place in therapy |journal=Adv Ther |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=114–26 | date=February 2013 |pmid=23361833 |doi=10.1007/s12325-013-0006-7 |url=}}</ref> but a second called the incidence of movement-related disorders "rather high".<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Veselinović T, Paulzen M, Gründer G |title=Cariprazine, a new, orally active dopamine D2/3 receptor partial agonist for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar mania and depression |journal=Expert Rev Neurother |volume=13 |issue=11 |pages=1141–59 | date=November 2013 |pmid=24175719 |doi=10.1586/14737175.2013.853448 |url=}}</ref><ref name="Newman-Tancredi2011">{{Cite journal | last1 = Newman-Tancredi | first1 = A. | last2 = Kleven | first2 = MS. | title = Comparative pharmacology of antipsychotics possessing combined dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptor properties | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 216 | issue = 4 | pages = 451–73 |date=Aug 2011 | doi = 10.1007/s00213-011-2247-y | pmid = 21394633 }}</ref>

[[File:Cariprazine mechanism.png|242px|thumb|Mechanism of cariprazine action as antagonist or agonist.]]

Unlike many antipsychotics that are D<sub>2</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> [[receptor antagonist]]s, cariprazine is a D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> [[partial agonist]]. It also has a higher affinity for D<sub>3</sub> receptors. The D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> receptors are important targets for the treatment of schizophrenia, because the overstimulation of dopamine receptors has been implicated as a possible cause of schizophrenia.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Seeman | first1 = P. | last2 = Kapur | first2 = S. | title = Schizophrenia: more dopamine, more D2 receptors | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 97 | issue = 14 | pages = 7673–5 |date=Jul 2000 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.97.14.7673| pmid = 10884398 | pmc=33999}}</ref> Cariprazine acts to inhibit overstimulated dopamine receptors (acting as an antagonist) and stimulate the same receptors when the endogenous dopamine levels are low. Cariprazine’s high selectivity towards D<sub>3</sub> receptors could prove to reduce side effects associated with the other antipsychotic drugs, because D<sub>3</sub> receptors are mainly located in the [[ventral striatum]] and would not incur the same motor side effects ([[extrapyramidal symptoms]]) as drugs that act on [[dorsal striatum]] dopamine receptors.<ref name="Gyertyan2011">{{Cite journal | last1 = Gyertyán | first1 = I. | last2 = Kiss | first2 = B. | last3 = Sághy | first3 = K. | last4 = Laszy | first4 = J. | last5 = Szabó | first5 = G. | last6 = Szabados | first6 = T. | last7 = Gémesi | first7 = LI. | last8 = Pásztor | first8 = G. | last9 = Zájer-Balázs | first9 = M. | last10 = Kapás | first10 = Margit | last11 = Csongor | first11 = Éva Ágai | last12 = Domány | first12 = György | last13 = Tihanyi | first13 = Károly | last14 = Szombathelyi | first14 = Zsolt | title = Cariprazine (RGH-188), a potent D3/D2 dopamine receptor partial agonist, binds to dopamine D3 receptors in vivo and shows antipsychotic-like and procognitive effects in rodents | journal = Neurochemistry International | volume = 59 | issue = 6 | pages = 925–35 |date=Nov 2011 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuint.2011.07.002 | pmid = 21767587 | display-authors = 8 }}</ref> Cariprazine also acts on [[5-HT1A receptor|5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors]], though the affinity is considerably lower than the affinity to dopamine receptors (seen in monkey and rat brain studies).<ref name="Gyertyan2011"/><ref name="Seneca2011">{{Cite journal | last1 = Seneca | first1 = N. | last2 = Finnema | first2 = SJ. | last3 = Laszlovszky | first3 = I. | last4 = Kiss | first4 = B. | last5 = Horváth | first5 = A. | last6 = Pásztor | first6 = G. | last7 = Kapás | first7 = M. | last8 = Gyertyán | first8 = I. | last9 = Farkas | first9 = S. | last10 = Innis | first10 = Robert B. | last11 = Halldin | first11 = Christer | last12 = Gulyás | first12 = Balázs | title = Occupancy of dopamine D₂ and D₃ and serotonin 5-HT₁A receptors by the novel antipsychotic drug candidate, cariprazine (RGH-188), in monkey brain measured using positron emission tomography | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 218 | issue = 3 | pages = 579–87 |date=Dec 2011 | doi = 10.1007/s00213-011-2343-z | pmid = 21625907 | pmc=3210913| display-authors = 8 }}</ref> In the same studies, cariprazine has been noted to produce pro-cognitive effects, the mechanisms of which are currently under investigation. An example of pro-cognitive effects occurred in pre-clinical trials with rats: rats with cariprazine performed better in a scopolamine-induced learning impairment paradigm in a [[Morris water navigation task|water labyrinth test]]. This may be due to the selective antagonist nature of D<sub>3</sub> receptors, though further studies need to be conducted.<ref name="Gyertyan2011"/> This result could be very useful for schizophrenia, as one of the symptoms includes cognitive deficits.

Cariprazine has partial agonist as well as antagonist properties depending on the endogenous dopamine levels. When endogenous dopamine levels are high (as is hypothesized in schizophrenic patients), cariprazine acts as an antagonist by blocking dopamine receptors. When endogenous dopamine levels are low, cariprazine acts more as an agonist, increasing dopamine receptor activity.<ref name = ADV1>{{cite journal|title=Cariprazine in Schizophrenia: Clinical Efﬁcacy, Tolerability, and Place in Therapy|journal=Advances in Therapy|date=February 2013|volume=30|issue=2|pages=114–126|doi=10.1007/s12325-013-0006-7|pmid=23361833|author=Citrome, L}}</ref> In monkey studies, the administration of increasing doses of cariprazine resulted in a dose-dependent and saturable reduction of specific binding. At the highest dose (300 ''μ''g/kg), the D<sub>2</sub>/D<sub>3</sub> receptors were 94% occupied, while at the lowest dose (1 ''μ''g/kg), receptors were 5% occupied.<ref name="Seneca2011"/>

===Pharmacokinetics===
Cariprazine has high oral [[bioavailability]] and can cross the [[blood brain barrier]] easily in humans because it is lipophilic.<ref name="Gründer2010"/> In rats, the oral bioavailability was 52% (with a dose of 1&nbsp;mg/kg).<ref name="Newman-Tancredi2011"/>
