==Medical uses==

===Sleeping sickness===
Sleeping sickness, or trypanosomiasis, is treated with [[pentamidine]] or [[suramin]] (depending on subspecies of parasite) delivered by intramuscular injection in the first phase of the disease, and with [[melarsoprol]] and eflornithine intravenous injection in the second phase of the disease. Efornithine is commonly given in combination with [[nifurtimox]], which reduces the treatment time to 7 days of eflornithine infusions plus 10 days of oral nifurtimox tablets.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Babokhov P |displayauthors=etal |title=A current analysis of chemotherapy strategies for the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis |journal=Pathog Glob Health |volume=107 |issue=5 |pages=242–52 |doi=10.1179/2047773213Y.0000000105 |pmc=4001453 |pmid=23916333|year=2013 }}</ref>

Eflornithine is also effective in combination with other drugs, such as melarsoprol and nifurtimox. A study in 2005 compared the safety of eflornithine alone to melarsoprol and found eflornithine to be more effective and safe in treating second-stage sleeping sickness ''Trypanosoma brucei gambiense''.<ref name="Priotto2">{{cite journal |last1=Priotto |first1=Gerardo |displayauthors=etal |date=December 2006 |title=Three drug combinations for late-stage ''Trypanosoma brucei gambiense'' sleeping sickness: a randomized clinical trial in Uganda |journal=PLoS clinical trials |volume=1 |issue=8 |page=e39 |doi=10.1371/journal.pctr.0010039 |pmc=1687208 |pmid=17160135}}</ref> Eflornithine is not effective in the treatment of ''Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense'' due to the parasite's low sensitivity to the drug.

A randomized control trial was conducted in Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Uganda to determine if a 7-day intravenous regimen was as efficient as the standard 14-day regimen for new and relapsing cases. The results showed that the shortened regimen was efficacious in relapse cases, but was inferior to the standard regimen for new cases of the disease.<ref name="Vincent, Isabel M., et al." />

====Trypanosome resistance====
After its introduction to the market in the 1980s, eflornithine has replaced melarsoprol as the first line medication against Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) due to its reduced toxicity to the host.<ref name="Vincent, Isabel M., et al." /> ''Trypanosoma brucei'' resistant to eflornithine has been reported as early as the mid-1980s.<ref name="Vincent, Isabel M., et al." />

The gene TbAAT6, conserved in the genome of Trypanosomes, is believed to be responsible for the transmembrane transporter that brings eflornithine into the cell.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sayé M ''et al'' | year = 2014 | title = Proline Modulates the Trypanosoma cruzi Resistance to Reactive Oxygen Species and Drugs through a Novel D, L-Proline Transporter | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 9 | issue = 3| page = e92028 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0092028| bibcode = 2014PLoSO...992028S | pmid=24637744 | pmc=3956872}}</ref> The loss of this gene due to specific mutations causes resistance to eflornithine in several trypanosomes.<ref>Barrett, M.

Resistance to eflornithine has increased the use of melarsoprol despite its toxicity, which has been linked to the deaths of 5% of recipient HAT patients.<ref name="Vincent, Isabel M., et al." />

===Chemo preventative therapy===
It has been noted that [[ornithine decarboxylase]] (ODC) exhibits high activity in tumor cells, promoting cell growth and division, while absence of ODC activity leads to depletion of putrescine, causing impairment of RNA and DNA synthesis. Typically, drugs that inhibit cell growth are considered candidates for cancer therapy, so eflornithine was naturally believed to have potential utility as an anti-cancer agent. By inhibiting ODC, eflornithine inhibits cell growth and division of both cancerous and noncancerous cells.

However, several clinical trials demonstrated minor results.<ref name="Paul, F.">Paul, F. "Revival of 2-(difluoromethyl) ornithine (DFMO), an inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis, as a cancer chemopreventive agent." Biochemical Society Transactions 35.Pt 2 (2007): 353-355.</ref> It was found that inhibition of ODC by eflornithine does not kill proliferating cells, making eflornithine ineffective as a chemotherapeutic agent. The inhibition of the formation of polyamines by ODC activity can be ameliorated by dietary and bacterial means because high concentrations are found in cheese, red meat, and some intestinal bacteria, providing reserves if ODC is inhibited.<ref name="Gerner, Eugene W." /> Although the role of polyamines in carcinogenesis is still unclear, polyamine synthesis has been supported to be more of a causative agent rather than an associative effect in cancer.<ref name="Paul, F." />

Other studies have suggested that eflornithine can still aid in some chemoprevention by lowering polyamine levels in colorectal mucosa, with additional strong preclinical evidence available for application of eflornithine in colorectal and skin carcinogenesis.<ref name="Paul, F." /><ref name="Gerner, Eugene W.">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gerner EW, Meyskens FL | year = 2004 | title = Polyamines and cancer: old molecules, new understanding | url = | journal = Nature Reviews Cancer | volume = 4 | issue = 10| pages = 781–792 | doi=10.1038/nrc1454 | pmid=15510159}}</ref> This has made eflornithine a supported chemopreventive therapy specifically for colon cancer in combination with other medications. Several additional studies have found that eflornithine in combination with other compounds decreases the carcinogen concentrations of ethylnitrosourea, dimethylhydrazine, azoxymethane, methylnitrosourea, and hydroxybutylnitrosamine in the brain, spinal cord, intestine, mammary gland, and urinary bladder.<ref name="Gerner, Eugene W." />

==Contraindications==

===Topical===
Topical use is contraindicated in people hypersensitive to eflornithine or to any of the excipients.<ref name="emc.medicines.org.uk">{{cite web |url=http://www.emc.medicines.org.uk/medicine/21243/SPC/Vaniqa+11.5%+cream |title=Vaniqa Summary of Product Characteristics 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205163254/http://emc.medicines.org.uk/medicine/21243/SPC/Vaniqa+11.5%25+cream/ |archivedate=2009-12-05 |df= }}</ref>

Throughout clinical trials, data from a limited number of exposed pregnancies indicate that there is no clinical evidence that treatment with Vaniqa adversely affects pregnant women or fetuses.<ref name="emc.medicines.org.uk"/>

===By mouth===
When taken by mouth the risk-benefit should be assessed in people with impaired renal function or pre-existing hematologic abnormalities, as well as those with eighth-cranial-nerve impairment.<ref name="Ornidyl Drug Information">{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/mmx/ornidyl.html |title=Ornidyl Drug Information |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607070234/http://www.drugs.com/mmx/ornidyl.html |archivedate=2011-06-07 |df= }}</ref>
Adequate and well-controlled studies with eflornithine have not been performed regarding pregnancy in humans. Eflornithine should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus. However, since African trypanosomiasis has a high mortality rate if left untreated, treatment with eflornithine may justify any potential risk to the fetus.<ref name="Ornidyl Drug Information"/>

==Side effects==
Eflornithine is not genotoxic; no tumour-inducing effects have been observed in carcinogenicity studies, including one photocarcinogenicity study.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Malhotra B, Noveck R, Behr D, Palmisano M |title=Percutaneous absorption and pharmacokinetics of Eflornithine HCI 13.9% cream in women with unwanted facial hair |journal=J Clin Pharmacol |date=September 2001 |volume=41 |issue=9 |pages=972–978 |doi=10.1177/009127000104100907 |doi-broken-date=2017-01-28 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1177/009127000104100907/abstract |pmid=11549102 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112021229/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1177/009127000104100907/abstract |archivedate=2016-11-12 |df= }}</ref> No teratogenic effects have been detected.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal|title=Vaniqa Product Monograph}}</ref>

===Topical ===
The topical form of elflornithine is sold under the brand name Vaniqa . The most frequently reported side effect is acne (7–14%). Other side effects commonly (> 1%) reported are skin problems, such as skin reactions from in-growing hair, hair loss, burning, stinging or tingling sensations, dry skin, itching, redness or rash.<ref name="vaniqa.com"/>

===Intravenous ===
The intravenous dosage form of eflornithine is sold under the brand name Ornidyl. Most side effects related to systemic use through injection are transient and reversible by discontinuing the drug or decreasing the dose. Hematologic abnormalities occur frequently, ranging from 10–55%. These abnormalities are dose-related and are usually reversible. [[Thrombocytopenia]] is thought to be due to a production defect rather than to peripheral destruction. [[Seizures]] were seen in approximately 8% of patients, but may be related to the disease state rather than the drug. Reversible hearing loss has occurred in 30–70% of patients receiving long-term therapy (more than 4–8 weeks of therapy or a total dose of >300&nbsp;grams); high-frequency hearing is lost first, followed by middle- and low-frequency hearing. Because treatment for African trypanosomiasis is short-term, patients are unlikely to experience hearing loss.<ref name="vaniqa.com" />

==Interactions==

===Topical===
No interaction studies with the topical form have been performed.<ref name="emc.medicines.org.uk"/>

[[File:Eflornithine ODC Reaction Mechansim.png|thumb|Eflornithine ODC Reaction Mechansim]]

===Description===
Eflornithine is a "[[Suicide inhibition|suicide inhibitor]]," irreversibly binding to [[ornithine decarboxylase]] (ODC) and preventing the natural substrate ornithine from accessing the active site (Figure 1). Within the active site of ODC, eflornithine undergoes [[decarboxylation]] with the aid of cofactor pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP). Because of its additional difluoromethyl group in comparison to ornithine, eflornithine is able to bind to a neighboring Cys-360 residue, permanently remaining fixated within the active site.<ref name=":0" />

During the reaction, eflornithine's decarboxylation mechanism is analogous to that of ornithine in the active site, where [[transamination]] occurs with PLP followed by decarboxylation. During the event of decarboxylation, the fluoride atoms attached to the additional methyl group pull the resulting negative charge from the release of carbon dioxide, causing a fluoride ion to be released. In the natural substrate of ODC, the ring of PLP accepts the electrons that result from the release of CO<sub>2</sub>.

The remaining [[fluoride]] atom that resides attached to the additional methyl group creates an electrophilic carbon that is attacked by the nearby thiol group of Cys-360, allowing eflornithine to remain permanently attached to the enzyme following the release of the second fluoride atom and transimination.

===Evidence===

[[File:Experimental Evidence.png|thumb|Figure 2 <br>Experimental Evidence for Eflornithine End Product<ref name=mech/>]]

The reaction mechanism of [[Trypanosoma brucei]]'s ODC with ornithine was characterized by UV-VIS spectroscopy in order to identify unique intermediates that occurred during the reaction. The specific method of multiwavelength stopped-flow spectroscopy utilized monochromatic light and fluorescence to identify five specific intermediates due to changes in absorbance measurements.<ref name=name>{{cite journal|last=Brooks|first=HB|author2=Phillips, MA|title=Characterization of the reaction mechanism for Trypanosoma brucei ornithine decarboxylase by multiwavelength stopped-flow spectroscopy.|journal=Biochemistry|date=Dec 9, 1997|volume=36|issue=49|pages=15147–55|pmid=9398243|doi=10.1021/bi971652b}}</ref> The steady-state turnover number, kcat, of ODC was calculated to be 0.5 s-1 at 4&nbsp;°C.<ref name=name/> From this characterization, the rate-limiting step was determined to be the release of the product putrescine from ODC's reaction with ornithine.
In studying the hypothetical reaction mechanism for eflornithine, information collected from radioactive peptide and eflornithine mapping, high pressure liquid [[chromatography]], and gas phase peptide sequencing suggested that Lys-69 and Cys-360 are covalently bound to eflornithine in T. brucei ODC's active site.<ref name=mech>{{cite journal|last=Poulin|first=R|author2=Lu, L |author3=Ackermann, B |author4=Bey, P |author5= Pegg, AE |title=Mechanism of the irreversible inactivation of mouse ornithine decarboxylase by alpha-difluoromethylornithine.

Eflornithine's suicide inhibition of ODC physically blocks the natural substrate ornithine from accessing the active site of the enzyme (Figure 3).<ref name=":0" /> There are two distinct active sites formed by the [[homodimerization]] of ornithine decarboxylase. The size of the opening to the active site is approximately 13.6 Å. When these openings to the active site are blocked, there are no other ways through which ornithine can enter the active site. During the intermediate stage of eflornithine with PLP, its position near Cys-360 allows an interaction to occur. As the phosphate of PLP is stabilized by Arg 277 and a Gly-rich loop (235-237), the difluoromethyl group of eflornithine is able to interact and remain fixated to both Cys-360 and PLP prior to transimination.
As shown in the figure, the pyrroline ring interferes with ornithine's entry (Figure 4). Eflornithine will remain permanently bound in this position to Cys-360. As ODC has two active sites, two eflornithine molecules are required to completely inhibit ODC from ornithine decarboxylation.

==History==
Eflornithine was initially developed for cancer treatment at Merrell Dow Research Institute in the late 1970s, but was found to be ineffective in treating malignancies. However, it was discovered to be highly effective in reducing hair growth,<ref name="Wolf">{{cite journal |author1=Wolf JE |author2=Shander D |author3=Huber F |author4=Jackson J |author5=Lin CS |author6=Mathes BM |author7=Schrode K |author8=the Eflornithine Study Group. |title=Randomized, double-blind clinical evaluation of the efficacy and safety of topical eflornithine HCI 13.9% cream in the treatment of women with facial hair. |journal=Int J Dermatol. |date=January 2007 |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=94–8 |pmid=17214730 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-4632.2006.03079.x}}</ref> as well as in the treatment of  [[African trypanosomiasis]] (sleeping sickness),<ref name="Pepin J, Milord F, Guern C, Schechter PJ 1987. 1431–3">{{cite journal |vauthors=Pepin J, Milord F, Guern C, Schechter PJ |year=1987 |title=Difluoromethylornithine for arseno-resistant Trypanosoma brucei gambiense sleeping sickness|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T1B-49H8DTD-98&_user=10&_coverDate=12/19/1987&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=2895e6b6e902eb8b1e1e57b8b8ec0ce3   |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(87)91131-7 |pmid=2891995 |volume=2 |issue=8573 |pages=1431–3 |journal=Lancet}}</ref> especially the West African form (Trypanosoma brucei gambiense).

===Hirsutism===
In the 1980s, Gillette was awarded a patent for the discovery that topical application of eflornithine HCl cream inhibits hair growth. In the 1990s, Gillette conducted dose-ranging studies with eflornithine in hirsute women that demonstrated that the drug slows the rate of facial hair growth. Gillette then filed a patent for the formulation of eflornithine cream. In July 2000, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) granted a [[New Drug Application]] for Vaniqa. The following year, the European Commission issued its Marketing Authorisation.

===Sleeping sickness treatment===
The drug was registered for the treatment of gambiense sleeping sickness on November 28, 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/tdrold/publications/tdrnews/news64/eflornithine.htm |title=New lease of life for resurrection drug }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> However, in 1995 Aventis (now Sanofi-Aventis) stopped producing the drug, whose main market was African countries, because it did not make a profit.<ref name="MSF">{{cite web|url=http://www.msf.org/article/supply-sleeping-sickness-drugs-confirmed|title=Supply of sleeping sickness drugs confirmed|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921203626/http://www.msf.org/article/supply-sleeping-sickness-drugs-confirmed|archivedate=2015-09-21|df=}}</ref>

In 2001, Aventis and the WHO formed a five-year partnership, during which more than 320,000 vials of pentamidine, over 420,000 vials of melarsoprol, and over 200,000 bottles of eflornithine were produced by Aventis, to be given to the WHO and distributed by the association [[Médecins sans Frontières]] (also known as Doctors Without Borders)<ref name="en.sanofi-aventis.com">{{cite web|url=http://en.sanofi-aventis.com/binaries/brochure_aam_en_tcm28-18133.pdf|title=Sanofi-Aventis Access to Medicines Brochure|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081114211421/http://en.sanofi-aventis.com/binaries/brochure_aam_en_tcm28-18133.pdf|archivedate=2008-11-14|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ifpma.org/Health/other_infect/health_sleep.aspx |title=IFPMA Health Initiatives: Sleeping Sickness |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829033157/http://www.ifpma.org/Health/other_infect/health_sleep.aspx |archivedate=2006-08-29 |df= }}</ref> in countries where sleeping sickness is endemic.

According to [[Médecins sans Frontières]], this only happened after "years of international pressure," and coinciding with the period when media attention was generated because of the launch of another eflornithine-based product (Vaniqa, for the prevention of facial-hair in women),<ref name="MSF"/> while its life-saving formulation (for sleeping sickness) was not being produced.

From 2001 (when production was restarted) through 2006, 14 million diagnoses were made. This greatly contributed to stemming the spread of sleeping sickness, and to saving nearly 110,000 lives.
