'''Isopropyl myristate''' is the [[ester]] of [[isopropyl alcohol]] and [[myristic acid]].

==Uses==
Isopropyl myristate is a polar emollient and is used in cosmetic and topical medicinal preparations where good absorption into the skin is desired. Isopropyl myristate is being studied as a skin enhancer. 
It is also used as a [[pesticide]] against [[pediculosis|head lice]] which works by dissolving the [[wax]] that covers the [[exoskeleton]] of head lice, killing them by [[dehydration]].<ref>[http://www.lice.ca/treatment/anti_lice_insecticide.html Anti-Lice Treatments]</ref>

It is used as a solvent in perfume materials.

It is the [[non-aqueous]] component of the two-phase [[mouthwash]], [[Dentyl pH]], where it removes bacteria from the oral cavity.

It is also used in the removal process of [[prosthetic make-up]].

It is also used in flea and tick products for pets.

The [[hydrolysis]] of the ester from isopropyl myristate can liberate the acid and the alcohol. The acid could be responsible for decreasing of the pH value of formulations.<ref>Wen, Z.; Fang, L. and He, Z. (2009).
