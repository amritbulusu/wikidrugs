It is the ''N''-[[Hydroxyl|hydroxy]] [[homology (chemistry)|homologue]] of [[MDMA]] ("Ecstasy"), and the ''N''-[[methyl]] homologue of [[MDOH]]. MDHMA was first [[Organic synthesis|synthesized]] and [[assay]]ed by [[Alexander Shulgin]].<ref>{{CitePiHKAL}}</ref> In his book ''[[PiHKAL]]'' (''Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved''), Shulgin listed the dosage range as 100–160&nbsp;mg, and the duration as approximately 4–8 hours.<ref>{{CitePiHKAL}}</ref> He describes MDHMA as causing entactogenic and open MDMA-like effects, easing communication, and increasing appreciation of the senses.<ref>{{CitePiHKAL}}</ref>
