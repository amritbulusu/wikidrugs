'''Phenylbutazone''', often referred to as "'''bute''',"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/us/death-and-disarray-at-americas-racetracks.html|title=Death and Disarray at America's Racetracks|publisher=New York Times|date=24 March 2012}}</ref> is a [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] (NSAID) for the short-term treatment of pain and fever in animals.

In the United States and United Kingdom it is no longer approved for human use (except for ankylosing spondylitis, because no other treatment is available), as it can cause severe adverse effects such as suppression of [[white blood cell]] production and [[aplastic anemia]]. This drug was implicated in the [[2013 meat adulteration scandal]]. Positive phenylbutazone tests in horse meat were uncommon in the UK, however.<ref name=fsa>{{cite web|title=Horse meat investigation. Advice for consumers|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/enforcement/monitoring/horse-meat/horse-meat-consumer-advice/|work=Enforcement and regulation|publisher=[[Food Standards Agency]]|accessdate=19 May 2013}}</ref>

==Uses==

===In humans===
Phenylbutazone was originally made available for use in humans for the treatment of [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[gout]] in 1949. However,  It is no longer approved, and therefore not marketed, for any human use in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/NewsEvents/CVMUpdates/ucm124078.htm|title=FDA Order Prohibits Extralabel Use of Phenylbutazone in Certain Dairy Cattle|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|date=28 February 2003}}</ref> In the UK it is used to treat [[ankylosing spondylitis]], but only when other therapies are unsuitable.<ref>[http://www.iow.nhs.uk/index.asp?record=1655 NHS: Drugs used in Rheumatic Diseases and Gout]</ref>

===In horses===
Phenylbutazone is the most commonly used NSAID for [[horse]]s in the United States.<ref name="McIlwraith">McIlwraith CW, Frisbie DD, Kawcak CE. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs. Proc. AAEP 2001 (47): 182-187.</ref> It is used for the following purposes:

* [[Analgesia]]: It is used for pain relief from [[infections]] and [[musculoskeletal disorders]], including [[sprain]]s, overuse injuries, [[Bowed tendon|tendinitis]], [[arthralgia]]s, [[arthritis]], and [[laminitis]]. Like other NSAIDs, it acts directly on [[musculoskeletal]] [[Biological tissue|tissue]] to control [[inflammation]], thereby reducing secondary inflammatory damage, alleviating pain, and restoring [[range of motion]]. It does not [[cure]] musculoskeletal ailments or work well on [[colic]] pain.
* [[Antipyretic|Antipyresis]]: It is used for reduction of fevers.  Its antipyretic qualities may mask other [[symptoms]]; therefore, it should not be administered for this purpose unless a [[veterinarian]] has concluded the horse would not be able to eat or drink without its use or that the fever might hinder the horse's recovery.

====History of phenylbutazone in racing====
In the 1968 [[Kentucky Derby]], [[Dancer's Image]], the winner of the race, was disqualified after traces of phenylbutazone were allegedly discovered in a post-race [[urinalysis]]. Owned by prominent [[Massachusetts]] businessman Peter Fuller and ridden by [[jockey]] [[Bobby Ussery]], Dancer's Image remains the only horse to win the Kentucky Derby and then be disqualified. Phenylbutazone was legal on most tracks around the United States in 1968, but had not yet been approved by [[Churchill Downs]].

Controversy and speculation still surround the incident. In the weeks prior to the race, Peter Fuller had given previous winnings to [[Coretta Scott King]], the [[widow]] of slain [[civil rights]] activist [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], which brought both praise and criticism. The previous year, King held a [[sit-in]] against housing discrimination which disrupted Derby week. Forty years later, Fuller still believes Dancer's Image was disqualified due to these events.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/sports/other_sports/horse_racing/articles/2008/05/02/thorns_and_roses/?page=1 Boston Globe article about the 40th Anniversary of the Race]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.seacoastonline.com/1999news/4_25_s1.htm |title=Sports: Dancer's tainted image |accessdate=2007-10-07 |work=}}</ref>

After many appeals, though, [[Forward Pass (horse)|Forward Pass]] was named the winner, the Kentucky Derby official website lists both Dancer's Image and Forward Pass as the winner. The website's race video commentary states that on the winner's plaque at [[Churchill Downs]], both Dancer's Image and Forward Pass are listed as the 1968 winner of the Kentucky Derby.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kentuckyderby.com/2006/derby_history/derby_charts/years/1968.html |title=Kentucky Derby 132 |accessdate=2007-10-07 |year=2006}}</ref>

===In dogs===
Phenylbutazone is occasionally used in dogs for the longer-term management of chronic pain, particularly due to [[osteoarthritis]]. About 20% of adult dogs are affected with osteoarthritis, which makes the management of musculoskeletal pain a major component of companion animal practice. The margin of safety for all NSAIDs is narrow in the dog, and other NSAIDs are more commonly used ([[etodolac]], and [[carprofen]]). Gastrointestinal-protectant drugs, such as [[misoprostol]], [[cimetidine]], [[omeprazole]], [[ranitidine]], or [[sucralfate]], are frequently included as a part of treatment with any NSAID. Dogs receiving chronic phenylbutazone therapy should be followed with regular blood work and renal monitoring.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wedgewoodpharmacy.com/monographs/phenylbutazone.asp |title=Wedgewood Pharmaceuticals-Phenylbutazol|format= |work=}}</ref>

Side effects of phenylbutazone in dogs include gastrointestinal (GI) ulceration, bone marrow depression, rashes, malaise, blood dyscrasias, and diminished renal blood flow.

==Dosage and administration in horses==
Phenylbutazone has a [[biological half-life|plasma elimination half-life]] of 4-8 hours, however the inflammatory exudate half life is 24 hours,<ref>Lees P, Taylor KBO, Higgins AJ, Sharma SC. Phenylbuta- zone and oxyphenbutazone distribution into tissue fluids in the horse. J Vet Pharmacol Ther 1986;9:204–212.</ref> so single daily dosing can be sufficient, although it is often used twice per day.<ref name=McIlwraith/> The drug is considered fairly non-toxic when given at appropriate doses (2.2-4.4 mg/kg/day), even when used repeatedly.<ref>Collins LG, Tyler DE. Phenylbutazone toxicosis in the horse: A clinical study. J Am Vet Med Assoc 1984;184: 699 –703.</ref> This dose has been doubled for diseases that cause severe pain, such as [[laminitis]], but is toxic if repeated long-term, and exceptionally high doses (15 mg/kg/d or higher) can kill the animal in less than a week.<ref name="MacKay">MacKay RJ, French TW, Nguyen HT, Mayhew IG. Effects of large doses of phenylbutazone administration in horse. Am J Vet Res 1983;44:774–780.</ref>

Phenylbutazone may be administered orally (via paste, powder or feed-in) or [[intravenous]]ly. It should not be given [[intramuscular]]ly or [[Injection (medicine)|injected]] in any place other than a [[vein]], as it can cause tissue damage. Tissue damage and [[edema]] may also occur if the drug is injected repetitively into the same vein.

Phenylbutazone should be administered only under the advice of a veterinarian.

==Side effects and disadvantages==
Side effects of phenylbutazone are similar to those of other NSAIDs. Overdose or prolonged use can cause [[Equine gastric ulcer syndrome|gastrointestinal ulcers]], [[blood dyscrasia]], [[kidney]] damage (primarily dose-dependant renal papillary necrosis), oral lesions if given by mouth, and internal [[hemorrhage]].<ref name="MacKay"/> This is especially pronounced in young, ill, or stressed horses which are less able to metabolize the drug.<ref>Lees P, Higgins AJ. Clinical pharmacology in therapeutic uses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the horse. Equine Vet J 1985;17:83–96.</ref> Effects of GI damage include edema of the legs and belly secondary to leakage of blood proteins into the intestines, resulting in decreased appetite, excessive thirst, weight loss, weakness, and in advanced stages, kidney failure and death.

Phenylbutazone should not be used in combination with [[vitamin K antagonist]]s such as [[warfarin]] or [[phenprocoumon]], as it amplifies the [[anticoagulant]] effect of these drugs; with other NSAIDs; or in horses with known kidney or liver problems. Phenylbutazone displaces warfarin from plasma binding sites and toxic blood levels leading to haemorrhage can occur.

Periodic blood tests are recommended when using phenylbutazone, as [[agranulocytosis]] can occur.

Phenylbutazone should be used cautiously in [[pregnant]] or [[nursing]] [[Mare (horse)|mares]], as it  may be [[toxic]] to the [[embryo]] and can be transferred via the [[umbilical cord]] and by [[milk]].

Phenylbutazone may be used in foals, but it should be used with particular caution. Premature foals, septicemic foals, foals with questionable kidney or liver function and foals with diarrhea require careful monitoring. Drugs to protect the GI tract such as omeprazole, cimetidine, and sucralfate are frequently used with phenylbutazone.

High doses of phenylbutazone may be considered a rules violation under some [[equestrianism|equestrian]] organizations, as the drug may remain in the [[bloodstream]] four to five days after administration.

The [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] places it in Group 3; i.e., "not classifiable as to its [[carcinogen]]icity to humans".

Use in horses is limited to those not intended for food. Metabolites of phenylbutazone can cause [[aplastic anaemia]] in humans.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Irish Veterinary Journal|volume=63|issue=12|title=Phenylbutazone and its availability in ireland – prudent prescribing and dispensing|author=Peadar Ó Scanaill|pages=766–8|url=http://www.veterinaryirelandjournal.com/Links/PDFs/CE-Large/CELA_Dec_2010.pdf.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/fssa/meavia/man/ch17/annexee.shtml|title=Ante and Post-mortem Procedures, Dispositions, Monitoring and Controls - Red Meat Species, Ostriches, Rheas and Emus|publisher=Canadian Food Inspection Agency}}</ref>

==Investigations into potential carcinogenicity==

Opinions are conflicting regarding the [[carcinogenicity]] of phenylbutazone in animals; no evidence indicates it causes cancer in humans at therapeutic doses. Maekawa ''et al.'' (1987) found no increased [[cancer]] incidence in [[DONRYU]] rats fed a diet containing 0.125% or 0.25% phenylbutazone over two years.<ref name=Maekawa1987>{{Cite journal

==Interactions==
Other anti-inflammatory drugs that tend to cause GI ulcers, such as corticosteroids and other NSAIDs, can potentiate the bleeding risk. Combination with anticoagulant drugs, particularly coumarin derivatives, also increases the risk of bleeding. Avoid combining with other hepatotoxic drugs.

Phenylbutazone may affect blood levels and duration of action of [[phenytoin]], [[valproic acid]], [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides]], [[sulfonylurea]] antidiabetic agents, [[barbiturate]]s, [[promethazine]], [[rifampicin]], [[chlorpheniramine]], [[diphenhydramine]], and [[penicillin G]].<ref name="Wedgewood">{{cite web |url=http://www.wedgewoodpharmacy.com/monographs/phenylbutazone.asp|title=Phenylbutazol for veterinary use|publisher=Wedgewood Pharmacy}}</ref>

==Overdose==
Overdoses of phenylbutazone can cause renal failure, liver injury, bone marrow suppression, and gastric ulceration or perforation. Early signs of toxicity include loss of appetite, and depression.<ref name="Wedgewood" />

==Chemistry==
Phenylbutazone is a [[crystal]]line [[Chemical substance|substance]]. It is obtained by condensation of diethyl ''n''-butylmalonate with [[hydrazobenzene]] in the presence of base. In effect, this represents the formation of the heterocyclic system by simple [[lactamization]].

<gallery>
File:1,2-Diphenylhydrazin.svg|Hydrazobenzene
File:Diethyl-butylmalonate skeletal.svg|Diethyl ''n''-butylmalonate
</gallery>

[[Oxyphenbutazone]], the major [[metabolite]] of phenylbutazone, differs only in the ''[[arene substitution patterns|para]]'' location of one of its [[phenyl group]]s, where a [[hydrogen]] [[atom]] is replaced by a [[hydroxyl group]] (making it 4-butyl-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenyl-3,5-pyrazolidinedione).
