==Overdose==
{{Main article|Tricyclic antidepressant overdose}}

The symptoms and the treatment of an overdose are largely the same as for the other TCAs, including the presentation of serotonin syndrome and adverse cardiac effects. The [[British National Formulary]] notes that amitriptyline can be particularly dangerous in overdose,<ref name = BNF/> thus it and other TCAs are no longer recommended as first-line therapy for depression. Alternative agents, SSRIs and SNRIs, are safer in overdose, though they are no more efficacious than TCAs. English folk singer [[Nick Drake]] died from an overdose of Tryptizol in 1974.

The possible symptoms of amitriptyline overdose include:<ref name = TGA/>

{{colbegin|3}}
* Drowsiness
* Hypothermia (low body temperature)
* Tachycardia (high heart rate)
* Other arrhythmic abnormalities, such as [[bundle branch block]]
* ECG evidence of impaired conduction
* [[Congestive heart failure]]
* Dilated pupils
* Convulsions (e.g. seizures, [[myoclonus]])
* Severe hypotension (very low blood pressure)
* [[Stupor]]
* Coma
* Death 
* [[Polyradiculoneuropathy]]
* Changes in the [[electrocardiogram]], particularly [[QT-interval prolongation]]<ref name=AmitryptilineQT/> and change in [[QRS complex|QRS axis]] or width

The treatment of overdose is mostly supportive as no specific antidote for amitriptyline overdose is available.<ref name = TGA/> Activated charcoal may reduce absorption if given within 1–2 hours of ingestion.<ref name = TGA/> If the affected person is unconscious or has an impaired gag reflex, a nasogastric tube may be used to deliver the activated charcoal into the stomach.<ref name = TGA/> ECG monitoring for cardiac conduction abnormalities is essential and if one is found close monitoring of cardiac function is advised.<ref name = TGA/> Body temperature should be regulated with measures such as heating blankets if necessary.<ref name = TGA/> Likewise, cardiac arrhythmias can be treated with [[propranolol]] and should heart failure occur, [[digitalis]] may be used.<ref name = TGA/> Cardiac monitoring is advised for at least five days after the overdose.<ref name = TGA/> Amitriptyline increases the CNS depressant action, but not the anticonvulsant action of barbiturates; therefore, an inhalation anaesthetic or [[diazepam]] is recommended for control of convulsions.<ref name = TGA/> [[Haemodialysis|Dialysis]] is of no use due to the high degree of [[Plasma protein binding|protein binding]] with amitriptyline.<ref name = TGA/>

==Interactions==
Amitriptyline is known to interact with:<ref name = TGA/>

* [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s as it can potentially induce a [[serotonin syndrome]]
* [[CYP2D6]] inhibitors and substrates such as [[fluoxetine]] due to the potential for an increase in plasma concentrations of the drug to be seen
* [[Guanethidine]] as it can reduce the antihypertensive effects of this drug
* [[Anticholinergic]] agents such as [[benztropine]], [[hyoscine hydrobromide|hyoscine]] (scopolamine) and [[atropine]], because the two might exacerbate each other's anticholinergic effects, including paralytic ileus and tachycardia
* [[Antipsychotics]] due to the potential for them to exacerbate the sedative, anticholinergic, epileptogenic and pyrexic (fever-promoting) effects. Also increases the risk of [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]]
* [[Cimetidine]] due to the potential for it to interfere with hepatic metabolism of amitriptyline and hence increasing steady-state concentrations of the drug
* [[Disulfiram]] due to the potential for the development of delirium
* [[Electroconvulsive therapy|ECT]] may increase the risks associated with this treatment
* [[Antithyroid agent|Antithyroid]] medications may increase the risk of [[agranulocytosis]]
* Thyroid hormones have a potential for increased adverse effects such as CNS stimulation and arrhythmias.
* [[Analgesics]], such as [[tramadol]] and [[pethidine]] due to the potential for an increase in seizure risk and [[serotonin syndrome]].
* Medications subject to gastric inactivation (e.g. levodopa) due to the potential for amitriptyline to delay gastric emptying and reduce intestinal motility
* Medications subject to increased absorption given more time in the small intestine (e.g. anticoagulants)
* Serotonergic agents such as the SSRIs and [[triptans]] due to the potential for [[serotonin syndrome]].

Amitriptyline is a highly lipophilic molecule having a [[Distribution coefficient|log D]] (octanol/water, pH 7.4) of 3.0,<ref>The Pharmaceutical Codex. 1994. Principles and practice of pharmaceutics, 12th edn. Pharmaceutical press</ref> while the [[Partition coefficient|log P]] of the free base was reported as 4.92.<ref>Hansch C, Leo A, Hoekman D. 1995. Exploring QSAR.Hydrophobic, electronic and steric constants.

Amitriptyline is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is extensively metabolized on first pass through the liver.<ref name = TGA/> It is metabolized mostly by [[CYP2D6]], [[CYP3A4]], and [[CYP2C19]]-mediated N-demethylation into nortriptyline,<ref name =TGA/> which is another TCA in its own right.<ref name = MD/> It is 96% bound to plasma proteins, nortriptyline is 93-95% bound to plasma proteins.<ref name = TGA/><ref name=MSRN>{{cite web|title=Pamelor, Aventyl (nortriptyline) dosing, indications, interactions, adverse effects, and more|work=Medscape Reference|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=2 December 2013|url=http://reference.medscape.com/drug/pamelor-nortriptyline-342944#showall|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203024651/http://reference.medscape.com/drug/pamelor-nortriptyline-342944#showall|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=}}</ref> It is mostly excreted in the urine (around 30–50%) as metabolites either free or as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates.<ref name = TGA/> Small amounts are also excreted in feces.<ref name = MSR/>

====Pharmacogenetics====
Since amitriptyline is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, genetic variations within the genes coding for these enzymes can affect its metabolism, leading to changes in the concentrations of the drug in the body.<ref name="pmid10319193">{{cite journal |vauthors=Rudorfer MV, Potter WZ | title = Metabolism of tricyclic antidepressants | journal = Cell Mol Neurobiol | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 373–409 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10319193}}</ref> Increased concentrations of amitriptyline may increase the risk for side effects, including anticholinergic and nervous system adverse effects, while decreased concentrations may reduce the drug's efficacy.<ref name="pmid 22565785">{{cite journal |vauthors=Stingl JC, Brockmoller J, Viviani R | title = Genetic variability of drug-metabolizing enzymes: the dual impact on psychiatric therapy and regulation of brain function | journal = Mol Psychiatry| volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 273–87 | year = 2013 | doi = 10.1038/mp.2012.42 |pmid = 22565785}}</ref><ref name="pmid 17113714">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kirchheiner J, Seeringer A | title = Clinical implications of pharmacogenetics of cytochrome P450 drug metabolizing enzymes | journal = Biochim Biophys Acta| volume = 1770 | issue = 3 | pages = 489–94 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17113714 | doi=10.1016/j.bbagen.2006.09.019}}</ref><ref name="pmid23486447">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hicks JK, Swen JJ, Thorn CF, Sangkuhl K, Kharasch ED, Ellingrod VL, Skaar TC, Muller DJ, Gaedigk A, Stingl JC | title = Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium Guideline for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 Genotypes and Dosing of Tricyclic Antidepressants | journal = Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics | volume = 93 | issue = 5 | pages = 402–8 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23486447 | pmc = 3689226 | doi = 10.1038/clpt.2013.2 }}</ref>

Individuals can be categorized into different types of CYP2D6 or CYP2C19 metabolizers depending on which genetic variations they carry. These metabolizer types include poor, intermediate, extensive, and ultrarapid metabolizers. Most individuals (about 77–92%) are extensive metabolizers,<ref name="pmid23486447"/> and have "normal" metabolism of amitriptyline. Poor and intermediate metabolizers have reduced metabolism of the drug as compared to extensive metabolizers; patients with these metabolizer types may have an increased probability of experiencing side effects. Ultrarapid metabolizers use amitriptyline much faster than extensive metabolizers; patients with this metabolizer type may have a greater chance of experiencing pharmacological failure.<ref name="pmid 22565785"/><ref name="pmid 17113714"/><ref name="pmid23486447"/>

The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium recommends avoiding amitriptyline in patients who are CYP2D6 ultrarapid or poor metabolizers, due to the risk for a lack of efficacy and side effects, respectively. The consortium also recommends considering an alternative drug not metabolized by CYP2C19 in patients who are CYP2C19 ultrarapid metabolizers. A reduction in starting dose is recommended for patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers and CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. If use of amitriptyline is warranted, therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended to guide dose adjustments.<ref name="pmid23486447"/> The Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group also recommends selecting an alternative drug or monitoring plasma concentrations of amitriptyline in patients who are [[CYP2D6]] poor or ultrarapid metabolizers, and selecting an alternative drug or reducing initial dose in patients who are [[CYP2D6]] intermediate metabolizers.<ref name="pmid21412232">{{cite journal |vauthors=Swen JJ, Nijenhuis M, de Boer A, Grandia L, Maitland-van der Zee AH, Mulder H, Rongen GA, van Schaik RH, Schalekamp T, Touw DJ, van der Weide J, Wilffert B, Deneer VH, Guchelaar HJ | title = Pharmacogenetics: from bench to byte--an update of guidelines | journal = Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics | volume = 89 | issue = 5 | pages = 662–73 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21412232 | doi = 10.1038/clpt.2011.34}}</ref>
