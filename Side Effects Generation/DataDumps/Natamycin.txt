'''Natamycin''', also known as '''pimaricin''' and sometimes sold as '''Natacyn''', is a naturally occurring [[Antifungal medication|antifungal]] agent produced during fermentation by the bacterium ''[[Streptomyces natalensis]]'', commonly found in soil. Natamycin has a very low solubility in water; however, natamycin is effective at very low levels.  Its [[minimum inhibitory concentration]] is less than 10&nbsp;[[Parts per million|ppm]] for most molds.  Natamycin is classified as a [[macrolide]] [[polyene]] antifungal, and as a drug, is used to treat fungal [[keratitis]], an infection of the eye.  It is especially effective against ''[[Aspergillus]]'' and ''[[Fusarium]]'' [[cornea]]l infections.  Other common members of the polyene macrolide antifungal family are [[amphotericin B]], [[nystatin]], and [[filipin]]. Natamycin is also used in the food industry as a natural preservative.

<!-- History and culture -->
It is on the [[World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines]], the most effective and safe medicines needed in a [[health system]].<ref name=WHO20th>{{cite web|title=WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (20th List)|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/20th_EML2017.pdf?ua=1|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=29 June 2017|date=March 2017}}</ref>

== Uses ==

=== Food ===
Natamycin has been used for decades in the food industry as a hurdle to fungal outgrowth in dairy products<!--illegal in most countries, meats, --> and other foods.  Potential advantages for the usage of natamycin might include the replacement of traditional chemical preservatives, a neutral flavor impact, and less dependence on pH for efficacy, as is common with chemical preservatives.  It can be applied in a variety of ways: as an aqueous suspension (such as mixed into a [[brine]]) sprayed on the product or into which the product is dipped, or in powdered form (along with an [[anticaking agent]] such as [[cellulose]]) sprinkled on or mixed into the product.  While not currently approved for use on meats in the United States, some countries allow natamycin to be applied to the surface of dry and fermented sausages to prevent mold growth on the casing.  Also, natamycin is approved for various dairy applications in the United States.  More specifically, natamycin is commonly used in products such as cream cheeses, cottage cheese, sour cream, yogurt, shredded cheeses, cheese slices, and packaged salad mixes. One of the reasons for food producers to use natamycin is to replace the artificial preservative [[sorbic acid]].<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/kraft-singles-ditch-artificial-preservatives-n27446 Kraft cheese singles ditch artificial preservatives]</ref>

As a [[food additive]], it has [[E number]] E235. Throughout the European Union, it is only approved as a surface preservative for certain cheese and dried sausage products. It must not be detectable 5&nbsp;mm below the rind. While natamycin is approved in different applications at different levels in the world, it is approved in over 150 countries worldwide.<ref>[http://www.natamycin.com Regulatory information: www.natamycin.com]</ref>

The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) panel took over the responsibilities of providing scientific food safety advice to the EU from the [[Scientific Committee on Food]] <!-- (SCF) --> in 2002.<ref>[http://www.understandingfoodadditives.org/pages/Ch3p1.htm Safety and regulation: the formal process for analyzing the test data on food additives]</ref>  In 2009, the EFSA considered the proposed use levels of natamycin are safe if it is used for the surface treatment for these cheese and sausages types.<ref name="EFSA-1412">[http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/1412.htm Scientific Opinion on the use of natamycin (E 235) as a food additive]</ref>

=== Medical ===

Natamycin is used to treat fungal infections, including ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]'', ''[[Aspergillus]]'', ''[[Cephalosporium]]'', ''[[Fusarium]]'', and ''[[Penicillium]]''. It is applied topically as a cream, in eye drops, or (for oral infections) in a [[throat lozenge|lozenge]]. Natamycin shows negligible absorption into the body when administered in these ways. When taken orally, little or none is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, making it inappropriate for systemic infections.<ref>Sweetman, S. (2004). ''Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference''</ref> Natamycin lozenges are also prescribed to treat yeast infections and [[oral thrush]]. <ref>Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine (http://cpharm.vetmed.vt.edu/VM8784/antimicrobials/Classes/antifungals.cfm)</ref>

== Safety ==

Natamycin does not have [[acute toxicity]]. In animal studies, the lowest {{LD50}} found was 2.5-4.5&nbsp;mg/kg.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Oostendorp|first1=J.G.|title=Natamysin(R)|journal=Antonie van Leeuwenhoek|volume=47|pages=170–1|date=1981|doi=10.1007/bf02342201}}</ref> In rats, the LD<sub>50</sub> is ≥2300&nbsp;mg/kg, and doses of 500&nbsp;mg/kg/day over 2 years caused no detectable differences in survival rate, growth, or incidence of [[tumors]]. The [[metabolites]] of natamycin also lack toxicity. The breakdown products of natamycin under various storage conditions may have a lower LD<sub>50</sub> than natamycin, but in all cases, the numbers are quite high. In humans, a dose of 500&nbsp;mg/kg/day repeated over multiple days caused nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.<ref name="InChem">[http://www.inchem.org/documents/jecfa/jecmono/v48je06.htm Mattia, A. et al. Safety evaluation of certain food additives and contaminants: natamicin (pimaricin). WHO Food Additives Series #48.]</ref>

No evidence shows natamycin, at either pharmacological levels or levels encountered as a food additive, can harm normal [[intestinal flora]], but definitive research may not be available.<ref name="InChem"/> However, some people are very '''allergic''' to natamycin. <ref>[http://www.rxlist.com/natacyn-side-effects-drug-center.htm Natacyn Side Effects Center]</ref>

The EFSA has concluded that the use of natamycin as a food additive has no relevant risk for the development of [[antibiotic resistance|resistant]] fungi.<ref name="EFSA-1412" />

Natamycin appears on [[Whole Foods]] “Unacceptable Ingredients for Food” list.<ref>Unacceptable Ingredients for Food (http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/about-our-products/quality-standards/food-ingredient)</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==

Natamcyin is able to inhibit growth of fungi by inhibiting transport of [[amino acids]] and [[glucose]] across the [[plasma membrane]]. Natamycin performs this function by specifically binding to [[ergosterol]] and inhibiting [[membrane transport proteins]].<ref> te Welscher, Y. M.; van Leeuwen, M. R.; de Kruijff, B.; Dijksterhuis, J.; Breukink, E. Polyene antibiotic that inhibits membrane transport proteins. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012, 109, 11156-11159.</ref>

== History==

Natamycin was first isolated in 1955 from fermentation broth of a ''Streptomyces natalensis'' cell culture. The discovery and properties of natamycin where announced in the article, “Pimaricin, a new antifungal antibiotic” in Antibiotics Annual in 1957. <ref name=NatamycinVGP>Natamycin VGP (http://www.natamycinvgp.com/the-origins-of-natamycin/#prettyPhoto)</ref>

Natamycin was originally named pimaricin to honor [[Pietermartizburg]], where ''Streptomyces natalensis'' was acquired. Pimaricin was later renamed natamycin after the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) mandated that antibiotics produced by ''Streptomyces'' end in –mycin. The name also related to the organism producing the compound, ''Streptomyces natalensis'', hence the name natamycin. <ref name="NatamycinVGP"/>
