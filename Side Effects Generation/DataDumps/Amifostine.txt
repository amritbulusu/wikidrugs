'''Amifostine''' ('''Ethiofos''') is a cytoprotective adjuvant used in cancer [[chemotherapy]] and [[radiotherapy]] involving [[DNA]]-binding chemotherapeutic agents. It is marketed by Clinigen Group under the trade name '''Ethyol'''.

==Indications==
Amifostine is used therapeutically to reduce the incidence of [[neutropenia]]-related fever and infection induced by DNA-binding chemotherapeutic agents including [[alkylating antineoplastic agent|alkylating agent]]s (e.g. [[cyclophosphamide]]) and platinum-containing agents (e.g. [[cisplatin]]). It is also used to decrease the cumulative [[nephrotoxicity]] associated with platinum-containing agents. Amifostine is also indicated to reduce the incidence of [[xerostomia]] in patients undergoing radiotherapy for head and neck cancer.

Amifostine was originally indicated to reduce the cumulative renal toxicity from cisplatin in non-small cell [[lung cancer]].  However, while nephroprotection was observed, the probability that amifostine could protect tumors could not be excluded. Additional data have shown that amifostine-mediated tumor protection, in any clinical scenario, is unlikely.

==Pharmacokinetics==
[[File:WR-1065 skeletal.svg|thumb|left|WR-1065, 2-((aminopropyl)amino)ethanethiol, the [[active metabolite]] of amifostine]]
Amifostine is an organic thiophosphate [[prodrug]] which is hydrolysed ''[[in vivo]]'' by [[alkaline phosphatase]] to the active cytoprotective [[thiol]] metabolite, WR-1065. The selective protection of non-malignant tissues is believed to be due to higher alkaline phosphatase activity, higher [[pH]], and vascular permeation of normal tissues.

Amifostine can be administered intravenously or subcutaneously after reconstitution with [[saline (medicine)|normal saline]]. Infusions lasting less than 15 minutes decrease the risk of adverse effects. The patient should be well-hydrated prior to administration.

== Mechanism of action ==

Inside cells, amifostine detoxifies reactive metabolites of platinum and alkylating agents, as well as scavenges [[free radicals]].<ref name=theoncologist/><ref name="bccancer">{{cite web | url = http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/HPI/DrugDatabase/DrugIndexPro/amifostine.htm | title = Amifostine : BC Cancer Agency | date = 2006-03-01 | work = | publisher = British Columbia Cancer Agency | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2011-01-01 }}</ref> Other possible effects include accelerated [[DNA repair]],<ref name="theoncologist">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kouvaris JR, Kouloulias VE, Vlahos LJ | title = Amifostine: the first selective-target and broad-spectrum radioprotector | journal = Oncologist | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 738–47 |date=June 2007 | pmid = 17602063 | doi = 10.1634/theoncologist.12-6-738 | url = | issn = }}</ref> induction of cellular hypoxia,<ref name=theoncologist/> inhibition of apoptosis,<ref name=bccancer/> alteration of gene expression<ref name=bccancer/> and modification of enzyme activity.<ref name=bccancer/> Amifostine is believed to radioprotect normal tissue via [[Warburg effect|Warburg]]-type effects.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Koukourakis|first=Michael I.|last2=Giatromanolaki|first2=Alexandra|last3=Zois|first3=Christos E.|last4=Kalamida|first4=Dimitra|last5=Pouliliou|first5=Stamatia|last6=Karagounis|first6=Ilias V.|last7=Yeh|first7=Tzu-Lan|last8=Abboud|first8=Martine I.|last9=Claridge|first9=Timothy D.

==Adverse effects==
Common [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]]s of amifostine include [[hypocalcemia]], [[diarrhea]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], sneezing, somnolence, and [[hiccoughs]]. 
Serious side effects include: hypotension (found in 62% of patients), [[erythema multiforme]], [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]] and [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]], immune [[hypersensitivity]] syndrome, [[erythroderma]], [[anaphylaxis]], and loss of consciousness (rare).

==Contraindications==
Contraindications to receiving amifostine include [[hypersensitivity]] to amifostine and [[aminothiol]] compounds like WR-1065. Ethyol contains [[mannitol]].
