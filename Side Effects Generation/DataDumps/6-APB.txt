'''6-APB''' ('''<u>6-</u>(2-<u>a</u>mino<u>p</u>ropyl)<u>b</u>enzofuran''') is an [[Empathogen-entactogen|empathogenic]] [[psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] compound of the [[substituted benzofuran]], [[substituted amphetamine]] and [[substituted phenethylamine]] classes. 6-APB and [[Benzofury (disambiguation)|other compounds]] are sometimes informally called "Benzofury" in newspaper reports. It is [[Structural analog|similar in structure]] to [[3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine|MDA]], but differs in that the 3,4-[[methylenedioxy]]phenyl [[Functional group|ring]] system has been replaced with a [[benzofuran]] ring. 6-APB is also the unsaturated benzofuran derivative of [[6-APDB]]. It may appear as a tan grainy powder. 6-APB was first synthesized by [[David E. Nichols|David Nichols]] and his team in 1993 while studying non-neurotoxic analogs of MDMA.

While the drug never became particularly popular, it briefly entered the rave and underground clubbing scene in the [[UK]] before its sale and import were banned. It falls under the category of [[research chemical]]s, sometimes called "legal highs." Because 6-APB and other substituted benzofurans have not been explicitly outlawed in some countries, they are often technically legal, contributing to their popularity.

== Pharmacology ==

=== Pharmacodynamics ===
6-APB is a [[serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor]] (SNDRI) with K<sub>i</sub> values of 117, 150, and 2698&nbsp;nM for the [[norepinephrine transporter]] (NET), [[dopamine transporter]] (DAT), and [[serotonin transporter]] (SERT), respectively.<ref name="pmid23261499">{{cite journal | vauthors = Iversen L, Gibbons S, Treble R, Setola V, Huang XP, Roth BL | title = Neurochemical profiles of some novel psychoactive substances | journal = Eur.

The potent agonism of the 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor makes it likely that 6-APB would be [[cardiotoxic]] with chronic or long-term use, as seen with other 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor agonists such as the [[withdrawn drug|withdrawn]] [[serotonergic]] [[anorectic]] [[fenfluramine]].<ref name="pmid23261499" /><ref name="ACMD report" />

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
The [[pharmacokinetics]] of 6-APB have not been studied, however, some information can be extracted from user reports. These suggest an slow onset of 20–120 minutes. The drugs maximum effects last 3–4 hours, followed by a comedown phase of up to 24 hours.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012415816000016X | title=Novel Psychoactive Substances: Classification, Pharmacology and Toxicology Chapter 16 – Benzofurans and Benzodifurans | publisher=Academic Press | author=Shaun L.

==== Metabolism ====
Although limited literature is available, there is some data on [[Drug metabolism|metabolism]] of 6-APB in rats. Its Phase I metabolism involves [[hydroxylation]] of the [[furan]] ring, then cleavage of the ring, followed by a [[Chemical reduction|reduction]] of the unsaturated [[aldehyde]] from the previous step. The resulting aldehyde may then takes two paths. It is either oxidized to a [[carboxylic acid]] or reduced to an [[alcohol]], and then [[Hydroxylation|hydroxylated]]. Phase II metabolism consists of [[glucuronidation]]. The most prevalent metabolites in rats were [[3-carboxymethyl-4-hydroxyamphetamine]] and [[4-carboxymethyl-3-hydroxyamphetamine]].<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.drugandalcoholdependence.com/article/S0376-8716(15)01693-2/abstract | title=Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and toxicology of new psychoactive substances (NPS): 2C-B, 4-fluoroamphetamine and benzofurans | date=December 2015 |author1=Johanna J.

6-APB succinate is reported to be practically insoluble in [[Chloroform|CHCl3]] as well as very minimally soluble in cold [[Properties of water|water]]. A batch seized by the DEA contained a 2:1 ratio of succinate to 6-APB.<ref name="Casale 2012">{{cite journal | url=https://www.dea.gov/pr/microgram-journals/2012/mj9_61-74.pdf | title=The Characterization of 6-(2-Aminopropyl)benzofuran and Differentiation from its 4-, 5-, and 7-Positional Analogues | author=John F. Casale, Patrick A. Hays | journal=Microgram Journal | date=January 2012 | volume=9 | issue=2 | pages=61–74}}</ref>

== Synthesis ==
Exact experimental details are not provided, but roughly follow the provided procedure. The procedure of Briner et al.<ref name="Briner 2000" /> was the most comprehensive thus far and was replicated by Casale and Hays<ref name="Casale 2012" /> as described below.

Briefly, 3-bromophenol was refluxed with [[bromoacetaldehyde]] and [[Sodium hydride|NaH]] to give the [[diethyl acetyl]], which then was heated with [[polyphosphoric acid]] to give a mixture of [[bromobenzofurans]] structural isomers: 4-Bromo-1-benzofuran and 6-Bromo-1-benzofuran. Both isomers were separated via [[silica gel]] [[column chromatography]], then catalytically converted to their respective [[2-propanone]]s, and then reductively aminated to 6-APB and [[4-APB]]. Both of which were converted to their [[Hydrogen chloride|HCl]] [[Ion Pair|ion-pairs]] for further examination.

]]

== Effects ==
Users report a feeling a sense of [[euphoria]] and energy. The effect has been most closely compared with those of [[MDMA|ecstasy]]. Adverse effects include loss of appetite, jaw tension, [[hallucination]]s, [[paranoia]], [[tachycardia]], [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s, [[insomnia]], [[anxiety disorder]], [[panic disorder]], [[psychotic depression]], [[substance-induced psychosis]], [[stimulant psychosis]], and [[depersonalization disorder]] .

== Law ==

=== Canada ===

6-APB is [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act#Schedule I|Schedule III]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://isomerdesign.com/Cdsa/schedule.php?schedule=1&section=18.5&structure=C | title=Controlled Drugs and Substances Act: Legislative History · Schedule I | publisher=Isomer Design}}</ref> in Canada as it is an analogue of [[3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine|MDA]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://isomerdesign.com/Cdsa/definitions.php?structure=C | title=Controlled Drugs and Substances Act: Definitions and Interpretations | publisher=Isomer Design}}</ref> The CDSA was updated as a result of the [[Safe Streets Act]] changing amphetamines from [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act|Schedule 3]] to [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule I controlled substances|Schedule 1]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/AnnualStatutes/2012_1/index.html | title=Safe Streets and Communities Act | publisher=Justice Laws Website | date=2012}}</ref>

=== France ===

6-APB is unscheduled in France.

=== Italy ===

6-APB is illegal in Italy.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_pagineAree_3729_listaFile_itemName_0_file.pdf | title=Nuove tabelle delle sostanze stupefacenti e psicotrope (DPR 309/90) | publisher=Ministero della Salute | language=Italian}}</ref>

=== Germany ===

6-APB is illegal in Germany since the 17th of July, 2013, when it was added to [[Drugs controlled by the German Betäubungsmittelgesetz|Anlage II]] of the [[Betäubungsmittelgesetz]].

=== Netherlands ===

6-APB is not listed under the [[Opium Law]] or the Medicine Act in the [[Netherlands]], and thus currently legal.

=== New Zealand and Australia ===

Certain countries contain a "substantially similar" catch-all clause in their drug law, such as [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]]. This includes 6-APB as it is similar in chemical structure to the class A drug [[3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine|MDA]], meaning 6-APB may be viewed as a controlled substance analogue in these jurisdictions.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1975/0116/latest/DLM436101.html | title=Misuse of Drugs Act 1975 | date=7 November 2015 | publisher=New Zealand Legislation}}</ref>

=== Sweden ===

In Sweden, as of 27 December 2009 6-APB is classified as "health hazard" under the act [[:sv:Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor|''Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor'']] (translated ''Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health'').<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.notisum.se/rnp/sls/fakta/a9990058.HTM | title=Förordning (1999:58) om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor | publisher=Lagbevakning med Notisum och Rättsnätet | date=24 November 2009 | language=Swedish}}</ref>

=== UK ===

On June 10, 2013 6-APB and a number of analogues were classified as [[Temporary class drug|Temporary Class Drugs]] in the UK following an ACMD recommendation.<ref name="ACMD report">{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/temporary-class-drug-order-report-on-benzofury-and-nbome-compounds | title=Temporary class drug order on benzofury and NBOMe compounds - letter from ACMD | publisher=GOV.UK | date=4 June 2013 | author=Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, Jeremy Browne}}</ref> This means that sale and import of the named substances are criminal offences and are treated as for class B drugs.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nbome-and-benzofury-to-be-banned | title='NBOMe' and 'Benzofury' banned | date=4 June 2013 | agency=GOV.UK | author=Home Office, Jeremy Browne}}</ref> On November 28, 2013 the ACMD recommended that 6-APB and related benzofurans should become [[Drugs controlled by the UK Misuse of Drugs Act|Class B]], [[Controlled Drug in United Kingdom|Schedule 1]] substances.<ref name="ACMD report" /> On March 5, 2014 the UK Home Office announced that 6-APB would be made a class B drug on 10 June 2014 alongside every other benzofuran entactogen and many structurally related drugs.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/1106/contents/made | title=The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Ketamine etc.) (Amendment) Order 2014 | publisher=The National Archives | date=28 April 2014 | author=UK Home Office}}</ref>

=== USA ===

6-APB is unscheduled in the United States, but not currently approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] for human consumption.
