====Role of antiandrogens in prostate cancer====

Dr. Madeline Deutsch of the [http://www.transhealth.ucsf.edu/ Center of Excellence for Transgender Health] at the [[University of California, San Francisco]], in her ''Guidelines for the Primary and Gender-Affirming Care of Transgender and Gender Nonbinary People'' (2016), has said the following on the topic of bicalutamide in transgender women:<ref name="Deutsch2016" />

{{Quotation|''In many countries, cyproterone acetate, a synthetic progestagen with strong anti-androgen activity is commonly used [as an antiandrogen in feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women]. Cyproterone [acetate] has been associated with uncommon episodes of fulminant hepatitis.[12] Bicalutamide, a direct anti-androgen used for the treatment of prostate cancer, also has a small but not fully quantified risk of liver function abnormalities (including several cases of fulminant hepatitis); while such risks are acceptable when considering the benefits of bicalutamide in the management of prostate cancer, such risks are less justified in the context of gender-affirming treatment.[13] No evidence at present exists to inform such an analysis.''<ref name="Deutsch2016" />}}

==Contraindications==

===Hepatic impairment===
In individuals with severe, though not mild-to-moderate [[hepatic impairment]], there is evidence that the elimination of bicalutamide is slowed, and hence, caution may be warranted in these patients.<ref name="Cockshott2004" /><ref name="SkeelKhleif2011">{{cite book |first1=Roland T. |last1=Skeel |first2=Samir N. |last2=Khleif |name-list-format=vanc |title=Handbook of Cancer Chemotherapy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Nz_87OLrtcC&pg=PA724 |year=2011 |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |pages=724– |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529144852/https://books.google.com/books?id=6Nz_87OLrtcC&pg=PA724 |archivedate=29 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In severe hepatic impairment, the terminal half-life of the active (''R'')-[[enantiomer]] of bicalutamide is increased by about 1.75-fold (76% increase; half-life of 5.9 and 10.4 days for normal and impaired patients, respectively).<ref name="Wellington2006" /><ref>{{cite book |title=Mosby's GenRx: A Comprehensive Reference for Generic and Brand Prescription Drugs |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QxsobYYgm8oC |year=2001 |publisher=Mosby |isbn=978-0-323-00629-3 |pages=289–290}}</ref><ref name="PDR2004">{{cite book | first = Thomson | last = PDR | name-list-format = vanc | title = Physicians' Desk Reference |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_sf2G6ZPDKAC |year=2004 |publisher=Thomson PDR |isbn=978-1-56363-471-0}}</ref> The terminal half-life of bicalutamide is unchanged in [[renal impairment]].<ref name="ChabnerLongo2010" />

===Pregnancy and breastfeeding===
Bicalutamide is [[Pregnancy category#United States|pregnancy category X]], or "contraindicated in [[pregnancy]]", in the {{abbr|U.S.|United States}},<ref name="FDALabel" /> and [[Pregnancy category#Australia|pregnancy category D]], the second most restricted rating, in [[Australia]].<ref name="TGALabel" /> As such, it is contraindicated in women during pregnancy, and women who are sexually active and who can or may become pregnant are strongly recommended to take bicalutamide only in combination with adequate [[contraception]].<ref name="IswaranImai1997" /><ref name="Smith2013" /> It is unknown whether bicalutamide is excreted in [[breast milk]], but many drugs are excreted in breast milk, and for this reason, bicalutamide treatment is similarly not recommended while [[breastfeeding]].<ref name="Dart2004" /><ref name="FDALabel" />

Because bicalutamide blocks the {{abbr|AR|androgen receptor}}, like all antiandrogens, it can interfere with the androgen-mediated [[sexual differentiation]] of the [[genitalia]] (and [[brain]]) during [[prenatal development]].<ref name="IswaranImai1997">{{cite journal | vauthors = Iswaran TJ, Imai M, Betton GR, Siddall RA | title = An overview of animal toxicology studies with bicalutamide (ICI 176,334) | journal = The Journal of Toxicological Sciences | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 75–88 | date = May 1997 | pmid = 9198005 | doi = 10.2131/jts.22.2_75 }}</ref><ref name="Smith2013">{{cite book |first1=Robert E. |last1=Smith |name-list-format=vanc |title=Medicinal Chemistry – Fusion of Traditional and Western Medicine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RkDcAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA306 |date=4 April 2013 |publisher=Bentham Science Publishers |isbn=978-1-60805-149-6 |pages=306– |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529034219/https://books.google.com/books?id=RkDcAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA306 |archivedate=29 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Sex Differences in the Human Brain, their underpinnings and implications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JFpq6hYQRhQC&pg=PA44 |date=3 December 2010 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-444-53631-0 |pages=44–45 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160526221656/https://books.google.com/books?id=JFpq6hYQRhQC |archivedate=26 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name="Paoletti2012">{{cite book | first = Rodolfo | last = Paoletti | name-list-format = vanc | title = Chemistry and Brain Development: Proceedings of the Advanced Study Institute on “Chemistry of Brain Development,” held in Milan, Italy, September 9–19, 1970 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YbgBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA218 |date=6 December 2012 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=978-1-4684-7236-3 |pages=218–}}</ref> In pregnant rats given bicalutamide at a dosage of 10&nbsp;mg/kg/day (resulting in circulating drug levels approximately equivalent to two-thirds of human therapeutic concentrations) and above, feminization of male offspring, such as reduced [[anogenital distance]] and [[hypospadias]], as well as impotence, were observed.<ref name="FDALabel" /> No other teratogenic effects were observed in rats or rabbits receiving up to very high dosages of bicalutamide (that corresponded to up to approximately two times human therapeutic levels), and no [[teratogen]]ic effects of any sort were observed in female rat offspring at any dosage.<ref name="FDALabel" /> As such, bicalutamide is a selective reproductive teratogen in males, and may have the potential to produce [[undervirilization]]/sexually [[ambiguous genitalia]] in male [[fetus]]es.<ref name="IswaranImai1997" /><ref name="Smith2013" />

==Side effects==
The [[side effect]] profile of bicalutamide is highly dependent on [[sex]]; that is, on whether the person is male or female. In men, due to [[hypoandrogenism|androgen deprivation]], a variety of side effects of varying severity may occur during bicalutamide treatment, with [[mastodynia|breast pain/tenderness]] and [[gynecomastia]] ([[breast development]]/[[mammoplasia|enlargement]]) being the most common.<ref name="Lehne2013">{{cite book | first = Richard A. | last = Lehne | name-list-format = vanc | title = Pharmacology for Nursing Care |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_4SwO2dHcAIC&pg=PA1297 |year=2013 |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=1-4377-3582-7 |pages=1297–}}</ref><ref name="WirthHakenberg2007">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wirth MP, Hakenberg OW, Froehner M | title = Antiandrogens in the treatment of prostate cancer | journal = European Urology | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 306–13; discussion 314 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17007995 | doi = 10.1016/j.eururo.2006.08.043 }}</ref> In addition breast changes, physical [[feminization (biology)|feminization]] and [[demasculinization]] in general, including reduced [[body hair]] growth, decreased [[muscle mass]] and [[muscle strength|strength]], [[gynoid fat distribution|feminine]] changes in [[body fat percentage|fat mass]] and [[fat distribution|distribution]], and reduced [[human penis size|penile length]], may also occur in men.<ref name="Lehne2013" /><ref name="Higano2003">{{cite journal | vauthors = Higano CS | title = Side effects of androgen deprivation therapy: monitoring and minimizing toxicity | journal = Urology | volume = 61 | issue = 2 Suppl 1 | pages = 32–8 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12667885 | doi = 10.1016/S0090-4295(02)02397-X }}</ref><ref name="pmid20626600" /><ref name="pmid23008326">{{cite journal | vauthors = Higano CS | title = Sexuality and intimacy after definitive treatment and subsequent androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 30 | issue = 30 | pages = 3720–5 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23008326 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2012.41.8509 | url = }}</ref> Other side effects that have been observed in men and that are similarly related to androgen deprivation include [[hot flash]]es, [[sexual dysfunction]] (e.g., loss of [[libido]], [[erectile dysfunction]]), [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[weakness]], [[anemia]], and decreased [[Ejaculation#Volume|semen/ejaculate volume]].<ref name="Lehne2013" /><ref name="Kolvenbag1996" /><ref name="ResnickThompson2000">{{cite book |first1=Martin I. |last1=Resnick |first2=Ian Murchie |last2=Thompson |name-list-format=vanc |title=Advanced Therapy of Prostate Disease |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9AKuf7rzfjcC&pg=PA379 |year=2000 |publisher=PMPH-USA |isbn=978-1-55009-102-1 |pages=379– |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610095331/https://books.google.com/books?id=9AKuf7rzfjcC&pg=PA379 |archivedate=10 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In women, on the other hand, due to the little biological importance of androgens in this sex,<ref name="pmid28343552">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kathryn Korkidakis A, Reid RL | title = Testosterone in Women: Measurement and Therapeutic Use | journal = J Obstet Gynaecol Can | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 124–130 | year = 2017 | pmid = 28343552 | doi = 10.1016/j.jogc.2017.01.006 | url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid26358173">{{cite journal | vauthors = Davis SR, Wahlin-Jacobsen S | title = Testosterone in women--the clinical significance | journal = Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol | volume = 3 | issue = 12 | pages = 980–92 | year = 2015 | pmid = 26358173 | doi = 10.1016/S2213-8587(15)00284-3 | url = }}</ref> the side effects of pure antiandrogens or {{abbr|NSAAs|nonsteroidal antiandrogens}} are minimal, and bicalutamide has been found to be very well-tolerated.<ref name="Shapiro2012" /> General side effects of bicalutamide that may occur in either sex include [[diarrhea]], [[constipation]], [[abdominal pain]], [[nausea]], [[dry skin]],<ref name="JamnickyNam2012">{{cite book | first1 = Leah | last1 = Jamnicky | first2 = Robert | last2 = Nam | name-list-format = vanc | title = Canadian Guide to Prostate Cancer |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EFJhvLJeWX4C&pg=PT177 |date=5 November 2012 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-1-118-51565-5 |pages=177–}}</ref> [[pruritus|itching]], and [[rash]].<ref name="Kolvenbag1996" /><ref name="Dart2004" /><ref name="pmid7579554">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lunglmayr G | title = Efficacy and tolerability of Casodex in patients with advanced prostate cancer.

====Skin changes====
Androgens are involved in regulation of the [[skin]] (e.g., [[Sebaceous gland#Sebum|sebum]] production), and antiandrogens are known to be associated with skin changes.<ref name="Kolvenbag1996" /> Skin-related side effects, which included dry skin, itching, and rash, were reported at a rate of 12% in both monotherapy and {{abbr|CAB|combined androgen blockade}} clinical studies of bicalutamide in men.<ref name="Kolvenbag1996" />

===With castration===
Combination of bicalutamide with medical (i.e., a {{abbr|GnRH|gonadotropin-releasing hormone}} analogue) or surgical castration modifies the side effect profile of bicalutamide.

==Interactions==

===Cytochrome P450 enzymes===
Bicalutamide is almost exclusively [[metabolized]] by [[CYP3A4]].<ref name="LemkeWilliams2008" /> As such, its levels in the body may be altered by [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]]s and [[enzyme inducer|inducer]]s of CYP3A4.<ref name="Skidmore-Roth2013">{{cite book | first = Linda | last = Skidmore-Roth | name-list-format = vanc | title = Mosby's 2014 Nursing Drug Reference – Elsevieron VitalSource |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ISYiAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA194 |date=17 April 2013 |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=978-0-323-22267-9 |pages=193–194}}</ref> (For a list of CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers, see [[CYP3A4#CYP3A4 ligands|here]].) However, in spite of the fact bicalutamide is metabolized by CYP3A4, there is no evidence of clinically significant [[drug interaction]]s when bicalutamide at a dosage of 150&nbsp;mg/day or less is co-administered with drugs that inhibit or induce [[cytochrome P450]] [[enzyme]] activity.<ref name="Wellington2006" />

===Plasma binding proteins===
Because bicalutamide circulates at relatively high concentrations and is highly protein-bound, it has the potential to displace other highly protein-bound drugs like [[warfarin]], [[phenytoin]], [[theophylline]], and [[aspirin]] from [[binding protein|plasma binding protein]]s.<ref name="WirthHakenberg2007" /><ref name="Kolvenbag1996" /> This could, in turn, result in increased free concentrations of such drugs and increased effects and/or side effects, potentially necessitating dosage adjustments.<ref name="WirthHakenberg2007" /> Bicalutamide has specifically been found to displace [[coumarin]] [[anticoagulant]]s like warfarin from their plasma binding proteins (namely [[human serum albumin|albumin]]) ''[[in vitro]]'', potentially resulting in an increased anticoagulant effect, and for this reason, close monitoring of [[prothrombin]] time and dosage adjustment as necessary is recommended when bicalutamide is used in combination with these drugs.<ref name="Weber2015" /><ref name="Mosby2001">{{cite book|title=Mosby's GenRx: A Comprehensive Reference for Generic and Brand Prescription Drugs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QxsobYYgm8oC|year=2001|publisher=Mosby|isbn=978-0-323-00629-3|page=290|quote=In vitro studies have shown bicalutamide can displace coumarin anticoagulants, such as warfarin, from their protein-binding sites.

The reason that testosterone levels are elevated but almost always remain in the normal male range with bicalutamide monotherapy is thought to be due to the concomitantly increased levels of estradiol, as estradiol is potently antigonadotropic and limits secretion of {{abbr|LH|luteinizing hormone}}.<ref name="IversenMelezinek2001" /> In fact, estradiol is a much stronger inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion than is testosterone, and even though circulating concentrations of estradiol are far lower than those of testosterone in men, it is said that estradiol is nonetheless likely the major feedback regulator of gonadotropin secretion in this sex.<ref name="JamesonKretser2013" /> In accordance, [[clomifene]], a {{abbr|SERM|selective estrogen receptor modulator}} with antiestrogenic activity, has been found to increase testosterone levels to as much as 250% of initial values in men with [[hypogonadism]],<ref name="BachNajari2016">{{cite journal | last1 = Bach | first1 = Phil Vu | last2 = Najari | first2 = Bobby B. | last3 = Kashanian | first3 = James A. | name-list-format = vanc | title = Adjunct Management of Male Hypogonadism | journal = Current Sexual Health Reports | year = 2016 | issn = 1548-3584 | doi = 10.1007/s11930-016-0089-7 }}</ref> and a study of clomifene treatment in normal men observed increases in {{abbr|FSH|follicle-stimulating hormone}} and {{abbr|LH|luteinizing hormone}} levels of 70–360% and 200–700%, respectively, with increases in testosterone levels that were similar to the increases seen with the gonadotropins.<ref name="pmid5135636">{{cite journal | vauthors = Santen RJ, Leonard JM, Sherins RJ, Gandy HM, Paulsen CA | title = Short- and long-term effects of clomiphene citrate on the pituitary-testicular axis | journal = J.

Bicalutamide more than blocks the effects of the increased testosterone levels that it induces in men, which is evidenced by the fact that monotherapy with the drug is about as effective as {{abbr|GnRH|gonadotropin-releasing hormone}} analogue therapy in the treatment of prostate cancer.<ref name="ChabnerLongo2010" /> However, in contrast, the effects of the elevated estrogen levels remain unopposed by bicalutamide, and this is largely responsible for the feminizing side effects (e.g., gynecomastia) of the drug in men.<ref name="pmid18062751">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sieber PR | title = Treatment of bicalutamide-induced breast events | journal = Expert Review of Anticancer Therapy | volume = 7 | issue = 12 | pages = 1773–9 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18062751 | doi = 10.1586/14737140.7.12.1773 }}</ref>

====Differences from castration====
It has been proposed that the increase in estrogen levels caused by {{abbr|NSAAs|nonsteroidal antiandrogens}} like bicalutamide compensates for androgen blockade in the brain, which may explain differences in the side effect profiles of these drugs relative to {{abbr|GnRH|gonadotropin-releasing hormone}} analogues/castration, {{abbr|CAB|combined androgen blockade}}, and {{abbr|CPA|cyproterone acetate}} (which, in contrast, decrease both androgen and estrogen levels).<ref name="WibowoSchellhammer2011" /><ref name="MotofeiRowland2011" /><ref name="pmid23484454">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wibowo E, Wassersug RJ | title = The effect of estrogen on the sexual interest of castrated males: Implications to prostate cancer patients on androgen-deprivation therapy | journal = Critical Reviews in Oncology/Hematology | volume = 87 | issue = 3 | pages = 224–38 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23484454 | doi = 10.1016/j.critrevonc.2013.01.006 }}</ref> In the case of sexual interest and function, this notion is supported by a variety of findings including animal studies showing that [[hypoestrogenism|estrogen deficiency]] results in diminished sexual behavior, treatment with tamoxifen resulting in significantly lowered libido in 30% of men receiving it for male breast cancer, and estrogen administration restoring libido and the frequency of [[sexual intercourse]] in men with [[congenital estrogen deficiency]], among others.<ref name="WibowoSchellhammer2011" /><ref name="MotofeiRowland2011" /><ref name="pmid23484454" /><ref name="SimpsonJones2007">{{cite journal | vauthors = Simpson ER, Jones ME | title = Of mice and men: the many guises of estrogens | journal = Ernst Schering Foundation Symposium Proceedings | volume = 2006/1 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–67 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17824171 | doi = 10.1007/2789_2006_016 }}</ref>

Treatment of men with [[exogenous]] testosterone or other {{abbr|AAS|anabolic–androgenic steroid}} results in suppression of gonadotropin secretion and gonadal testosterone production due to their antigonadotropic effects or activation of the {{abbr|AR|androgen receptor}} in the pituitary gland, resulting in inhibition or abolition of spermatogenesis and fertility:<ref name="DohleSmit2003">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dohle GR, Smit M, Weber RF | title = Androgens and male fertility | journal = World Journal of Urology | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 341–5 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14566423 | doi = 10.1007/s00345-003-0365-9 }}</ref>

{{Quotation|''It is theoretically a sound hypothesis that the spermatogenesis can be increased by indirectly stimulating {{abbr|FSH|follicle-stimulating hormone}} and {{abbr|LH|luteinizing hormone}} secretions from the pituitary gland.

==Pharmacokinetics==

The pharmacokinetics of bicalutamide are unaffected by food, [[ageing|age]], [[human body weight|body weight]], renal impairment, and mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment.<ref name="Cockshott2004" /><ref name="DenisMahler1996" /> However, it has been observed that steady-state concentrations of bicalutamide are higher in [[Japanese people|Japanese]] individuals than in [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]]s, indicating that [[ethnicity]] may be associated with differences in the pharmacokinetics of bicalutamide in some instances.<ref name="Cockshott2004" />
