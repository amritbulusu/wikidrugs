===Pharmacokinetics===
Very little information has been published on the clinical [[pharmacokinetics]] of phenibut.<ref name="pmid11830761" /> The drug is reported to be well-[[absorption (pharmacokinetics)|absorbed]].<ref name="Phenibut-Label" /> It [[distribution (pharmacology)|distribute]]s widely throughout the body and across the [[blood–brain barrier]].<ref name="Phenibut-Label" /> Approximately 0.1% of an administered dose of phenibut reportedly penetrates into the [[brain]], with this said to occur to a much greater extent in young people and the elderly.<ref name="Phenibut-Label" /> Following a single 250&nbsp;mg dose in healthy volunteers, its [[elimination half-life]] was approximately 5.3&nbsp;hours and the drug was largely (63%) [[excretion|excreted]] in the [[urine]] unchanged.<ref name="pmid11830761" /> In animals, the [[absolute bioavailability]] of phenibut was 64% after [[oral administration|oral]] and [[intravenous administration]], it appeared to undergo minimal or no [[metabolism]] in multiple species, and it crossed the blood–brain barrier to a significantly greater extent than GABA.<ref name="pmid11830761" /> The [[metabolite]]s of phenibut are reported to be inactive.<ref name="Phenibut-Label" />

==Chemistry==
Phenibut is a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]] [[aromatic amino acid]]. It is a [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral molecule]] and thus has two potential [[absolute configuration|configuration]]s, as (''R'')- and (''S'')-[[enantiomer]]s.<ref name="pmid18275958" />

===Structure and analogues===
[[File:Phenibut and analogues.png|thumb|right|350px|Chemical structures of phenibut and analogues.]]

Phenibut is a [[chemical derivative|derivative]] of the [[inhibitory postsynaptic potential|inhibitory]] neurotransmitter GABA.<ref name="pmid11830761" /> Hence, it is a [[GABA analogue]].<ref name="pmid11830761" /> Phenibut is specifically the [[structural analog|analogue]] of GABA with a [[phenyl ring]] substituted in at the β-position.<ref name="pmid11830761" /> As such, its chemical name is β-phenyl-γ-aminobutyric acid, which can be abbreviated as β-phenyl-GABA.<ref name="pmid11830761" /> The presence of the phenyl ring allows phenibut to cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] significantly, unlike the case of GABA.<ref name="pmid11830761" /> Phenibut also contains the [[trace amine]] [[β-phenethylamine]] in its [[chemical structure|structure]].<ref name="pmid11830761" />

Phenibut is closely related to a variety of other GABA analogues including [[baclofen]] (β-(4-chlorophenyl)-GABA), [[4-fluorophenibut]] (β-(4-fluorophenyl)-GABA), [[tolibut]] (β-(4-methylphenyl)-GABA), [[pregabalin]] ((''S'')-β-isobutyl-GABA), [[gabapentin]] (1-(aminomethyl)cyclohexane acetic acid), and [[GABOB]] (β-hydroxy-GABA).<ref name="pmid11830761" /><ref name="pmid26234470" /> It has almost the same chemical structure as baclofen, differing from it only in having a [[hydrogen]] atom instead of a [[chlorine]] atom at the ''para'' position of the phenyl ring.<ref name="pmid11830761" /> Phenibut is also close in structure to pregabalin, which has an [[isobutane|isobutyl]] group at the β position instead of phenibut's phenyl ring.<ref name="pmid26234470" />

===Synthesis===
A [[chemical synthesis]] of phenibut has been published.<ref name="SivchikGrygoryan">{{cite | last1 = Sivchik | first1 = V.V. | last2 = Grygoryan | first2 = H.O. | last3 = Survilo | first3 = V.L. | last4 = Trukhachova | first4 = T.V. | title = Синтез γ-амино-β-фенилмасляной кислоты (фенибута) | trans-title = [Synthesis of β-phenyl-γ-aminobutyric acid (phenibut) | year = 2012 | format = PDF | url = http://elib.bsu.by/bitstream/123456789/15950/1/C%D0%91%D0%9E%D0%A0%D0%9D%D0%98%D0%9A%202012.pdf#page=448}}</ref>

==History==
Phenibut was synthesized at the [[Herzen University|A. I. Herzen Leningrad Pedagogical Institute]] ([[USSR]]) by Professor Vsevolod Perekalin's team and tested at the Institute of Experimental Medicine, USSR Academy of Medical Sciences.<ref name="pmid11830761" /> It was introduced into clinical use in Russia in the 1960s.<ref name="pmid11830761" />
