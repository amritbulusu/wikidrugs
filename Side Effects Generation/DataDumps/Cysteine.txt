'''Cysteine''' (abbreviated as '''Cys''' or '''C''')<ref>{{IUPAC-IUB amino acids 1983}}</ref> is a semi-[[essential amino acid|essential]]<ref name=microbial>{{cite web|title=The primary structure of proteins is the amino acid sequence|url=http://www.microbiologytext.com/index.php?module=Book&func=displayarticle&art_id=661|work=The Microbial World|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison Bacteriology Department|accessdate=16 September 2012}}</ref> [[proteinogenic amino acid]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] HO<sub>2</sub>CCH(NH<sub>2</sub>)CH<sub>2</sub>SH. It is encoded by the [[codon]]s UGU and UGC. The [[thiol]] side chain in cysteine often participates in [[enzymatic]] reactions, as a [[nucleophile]].  The thiol is susceptible to oxidization to give the [[disulfide bond|disulfide]] derivative [[cystine]], which serves an important structural role in many [[protein]]s. When used as a food additive, it has the [[E&nbsp;number]] '''E920'''.

It can be seen as [[serine]], but with one of the oxygen atoms replaced with [[sulfur]]; replacing said atom with [[selenium]] gives [[selenocysteine]].

==Sources==

===Dietary sources===
Although classified as a [[non-essential amino acid]], in rare cases, cysteine may be essential for infants, the elderly, and individuals with certain metabolic disease or who suffer from [[malabsorption]] [[syndrome]]s. Cysteine can usually be synthesized by the human body under normal physiological conditions if a sufficient quantity of [[methionine]] is available.  Cysteine is [[catabolized]] in the gastrointestinal tract and blood plasma{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}.<!--

Obvious contradiction, not going to delete because reversions

--> In contrast, [[cystine]] travels safely through the GI tract and [[blood plasma]] and is promptly reduced to the two cysteine molecules upon cell entry.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Cysteine is found in most high-[[protein]] foods, including:
* Animal sources: [[meat]] (including [[pork]] and [[poultry]]), [[egg (food)|eggs]], [[dairy]];<ref>{{cite web | url = http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/supplement/cysteine | title = Cysteine | publisher = University of Maryland Medical Center}}</ref>

Like other amino acids, cysteine has an [[Amphoterism|amphoteric]] character. [[File:Betain-Cystein.png|thumb|left|250px|(''R'')-Cysteine (left) and (''S'')-Cysteine (right) in zwitterionic form at neutral pH]]

=== Industrial sources ===
The majority of <small>L</small>-cysteine is obtained industrially by [[hydrolysis]] of animal materials, such as poultry feathers or hog hair. Despite widespread belief otherwise, there is little evidence that human hair is used as a source material and its use is explicitly banned in the European Union.<ref>{{cite web|title=EU Chemical Requirements|website=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:083:0001:0295:EN:PDF}}</ref> Synthetically produced <small>L</small>-cysteine, compliant with Jewish [[kosher]] and Muslim [[halal]] laws, is also available, albeit at a higher price.<ref>{{Cite journal |url= http://www.vrg.org/nutshell/faqingredients.htm#cystine |title= Questions About Food Ingredients: What is L-cysteine/cysteine/cystine? |publisher= Vegetarian Resource Group |postscript= .}}</ref>  The synthetic route involves fermentation using a mutant of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]''.

=== Biosynthesis ===
[[File:Cysteine biosynthesis.svg|thumb|150px|Cysteine synthesis. [[Cystathionine beta synthase]] catalyzes the upper reaction and [[cystathionine gamma-lyase]] catalyzes the lower reaction.]]
In animals, biosynthesis begins with the amino acid [[serine]].  The sulfur is derived from [[methionine]], which is converted to [[homocysteine]] through the intermediate [[S-adenosylmethionine]].  [[Cystathionine beta-synthase]] then combines homocysteine and serine to form the asymmetrical thioether [[cystathionine]].  The enzyme [[cystathionine gamma-lyase]] converts the cystathionine into cysteine and [[alpha-ketobutyrate]].  In [[plant]]s and [[bacteria]], cysteine biosynthesis also starts from serine, which is converted  to ''O''-acetylserine by the enzyme serine transacetylase. The enzyme O-acetylserine (thiol)-lyase, using sulfide sources, converts this ester into cysteine, releasing acetate.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hell R |title=Molecular physiology of plant sulfur metabolism |journal=Planta |volume=202 |issue=2 |pages=138–48 |year=1997 |pmid=9202491 |doi=10.1007/s004250050112}}</ref>

==Biological functions==
The cysteine thiol group is [[nucleophile|nucleophilic]] and easily oxidized. The reactivity is enhanced when the thiol is ionized, and [[cysteine residue]]s in proteins have [[acid dissociation constant|pK<sub>a</sub>]] values close to neutrality, so are often in their reactive [[thiolate]] form in the cell.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bulaj G, Kortemme T, Goldenberg DP |title=Ionization-reactivity relationships for cysteine thiols in polypeptides |journal=Biochemistry |volume=37 |issue=25 |pages=8965–72 |date=June 1998 |pmid=9636038 |doi=10.1021/bi973101r}}</ref>  Because of its high reactivity, the thiol group of cysteine has numerous biological functions.

===Precursor to the antioxidant glutathione===
Due to the ability of thiols to undergo redox reactions, cysteine has [[antioxidant]] properties. Cysteine's antioxidant properties are typically expressed in the tripeptide [[glutathione]], which occurs in humans as well as other organisms. The systemic availability of oral glutathione (GSH) is negligible; so it must be biosynthesized from its constituent amino acids, cysteine, [[glycine]] and [[glutamic acid]]. Glutamic acid and glycine are readily available in most Western diets, but the availability of cysteine can be the limiting [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

===Precursor to iron-sulfur clusters===
Cysteine is an important source of [[sulfide]] in human [[metabolism]]. The sulfide in [[iron-sulfur cluster]]s and in [[nitrogenase]] is extracted from cysteine, which is converted to [[alanine]] in the process.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lill R, Mühlenhoff U |title=Iron-sulfur protein biogenesis in eukaryotes: components and mechanisms |journal=Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. |volume=22 |issue= |pages=457–86 |year=2006 |pmid=16824008 |doi=10.1146/annurev.cellbio.22.010305.104538}}</ref>

===Metal ion binding===
Beyond the iron-sulfur proteins, many other metal cofactors in enzymes are bound to the thiolate substituent of cysteinyl residues.  Examples include zinc in [[zinc finger]]s and [[alcohol dehydrogenase]], copper in the [[plastocyanin|blue copper protein]]s, iron in [[cytochrome P450]] and nickel in the [NiFe]-[[hydrogenase]]s.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Stephen J. |last1=Lippard |first2=Jeremy M. |last2=Berg |title=Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry |publisher=University Science Books |location=Mill Valley, CA |year=1994 |isbn=0-935702-73-3}}{{page needed|date=July 2013}}</ref> The thiol group also has a high [[Affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s, so that proteins  containing cysteine, such as [[metallothionein]], will [[ligand|bind]] metals such as mercury, lead and cadmium tightly.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Baker DH, Czarnecki-Maulden GL |title=Pharmacologic role of cysteine in ameliorating or exacerbating mineral toxicities |journal=J.

===Roles in protein structure===
In the translation of messenger RNA molecules to produce polypeptides, cysteine is coded for by the UGU and UGC [[codon]]s.

Cysteine has traditionally been considered to be a [[hydrophilic]] amino acid, based largely on the chemical parallel between its [[thiol group]] and the [[hydroxyl]] groups in the side-chains of other polar amino acids. However, the cysteine side chain has been shown to stabilize hydrophobic interactions in micelles to a greater degree than the side chain in the non-polar amino acid [[glycine]] and the polar amino acid [[serine]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Heitmann P |title=A model for sulfhydryl groups in proteins. Hydrophobic interactions of the cystein side chain in micelles |journal=Eur. J. Biochem. |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=346–50 |date=January 1968 |pmid=5650851 |doi=10.1111/j.1432-1033.1968.tb19535.x}}</ref> In a statistical analysis of the frequency with which amino acids appear in different chemical environments in the structures of proteins, free cysteine residues were found to associate with hydrophobic regions of proteins. Their hydrophobic tendency was equivalent to that of known non-polar amino acids such as [[methionine]] and [[tyrosine]] (tyrosine is polar aromatic but also hydrophobic<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wbiomed.curtin.edu.au/biochem/tutorials/AAs/AA.html|title=A Review of Amino Acids (tutorial)|publisher=Curtin University}}</ref>), those of which were much greater than that of known polar amino acids such as serine and [[threonine]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Nagano N, Ota M, Nishikawa K |title=Strong hydrophobic nature of cysteine residues in proteins |journal=FEBS Lett. |volume=458 |issue=1 |pages=69–71 |date=September 1999 |pmid=10518936 |doi=10.1016/S0014-5793(99)01122-9}}</ref> [[Hydrophobicity scales]], which rank amino acids from most hydrophobic to most hydrophilic, consistently place cysteine towards the hydrophobic end of the spectrum, even when they are based on methods that are not influenced by the tendency of cysteines to form disulfide bonds in proteins.

While free cysteine residues do occur in proteins, most are covalently bonded to other cysteine residues to form [[disulfide bond]]s. Disulfide bonds play an important role in the folding and stability of some proteins, usually proteins secreted to the extracellular medium.<ref name=Sevier>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sevier CS, Kaiser CA |title=Formation and transfer of disulphide bonds in living cells |journal=Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. |volume=3 |issue=11 |pages=836–47 |date=November 2002 |pmid=12415301 |doi=10.1038/nrm954}}</ref> Since most cellular compartments are [[reducing environment]]s, disulfide bonds are generally unstable in the [[cytosol]] with some exceptions as noted below.

[[Image:Cystine-skeletal.png|thumb|right|150px|Figure 2: [[Cystine]] (shown here in its neutral form), two cysteines bound together by a disulfide bond.]]

Disulfide bonds in proteins are formed by oxidation of the [[thiol]] groups of cysteine residues. The other sulfur-containing amino acid, [[methionine]], cannot form disulfide bonds.  More aggressive oxidants convert cysteine to the corresponding [[sulfinic acid]] and [[sulfonic acid]]. Cysteine residues play a valuable role by crosslinking proteins, which increases the rigidity of proteins and also functions to confer proteolytic resistance (since protein export is a costly process, minimizing its necessity is advantageous).  Inside the cell, disulfide bridges between cysteine residues within a polypeptide support the protein's tertiary structure.  [[Insulin]] is an example of a protein with cystine crosslinking, wherein two separate peptide chains are connected by a pair of disulfide bonds.

[[Protein disulfide isomerase]]s catalyze the proper formation of [[disulfide bond]]s; the cell transfers [[dehydroascorbic acid]] to the [[endoplasmic reticulum]], which oxidises the environment.  In this environment, cysteines are, in general, oxidized to cystine and are no longer functional as a nucleophiles.

Aside from its oxidation to cystine, cysteine participates in numerous [[posttranslational modification]]s.  The [[nucleophilic]] thiol group allows cysteine to conjugate to other groups, e.g., in [[prenylation]]. [[Ubiquitin]] [[ligase]]s transfer ubiquitin to its pendant, proteins, and [[caspase]]s, which engage in proteolysis in the apoptotic cycle.  [[Intein]]s often function with the help of a catalytic cysteine.  These roles are typically limited to the intracellular milieu, where the environment is reducing, and cysteine is not oxidized to cystine.

==Applications==
Cysteine, mainly the <small>L</small>-[[enantiomer]], is a [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] in the food, pharmaceutical and personal-care industries. One of the largest applications is the production of flavors. For example, the reaction of cysteine with sugars in a [[Maillard reaction]] yields meat flavors.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Tzou-Chi |last1=Huang |first2=Chi-Tang |last2=Ho |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=651Zv5hUzyIC&pg=PA71 |pages=71–102 |editor1-first=Y. H. |editor1-last=Hui |editor2-first=Wai-Kit |editor2-last=Nip |editor3-first=Robert |editor3-last=Rogers |title=Meat Science and Applications, ch. Flavors of Meat Products|publisher=CRC |isbn=978-0-203-90808-2}}</ref> <small>L</small>-Cysteine is also used as a [[improving agent|processing aid]] for baking.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/foodic.html |title=Food Ingredients and Colors |date=November 2004 |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=2009-09-06 |postscript={{inconsistent citations}} |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512090657/https://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/foodic.html |archivedate=2009-05-12 |df= }}. {{Dead link|date=April 2015}}</ref>

In the field of personal care, cysteine is used for [[permanent wave]] applications, predominantly in Asia. Again, the cysteine is used for breaking up the disulfide bonds in the [[hair]]'s [[keratin]].

Cysteine is a very popular target for site-directed labeling experiments to investigate biomolecular structure and dynamics. [[Maleimide]]s will selectively attach to cysteine using a covalent [[Michael addition]].  [[Site-directed spin labeling]] for EPR or paramagnetic relaxation enhanced NMR also uses cysteine extensively.

In a 1994 report released by five top [[cigarette]] companies, cysteine is one of the 599 additives to cigarettes. Like most cigarette additives, however, its use or purpose is unknown.<ref>{{Cite web | first = Terry | last = Martin | url = http://quitsmoking.about.com/cs/nicotineinhaler/a/cigingredients.htm | title = The List of Additives in Cigarettes | publisher = about.com | date = 2009-06-25 | accessdate = 2009-09-06 }}.</ref> Its inclusion in cigarettes could offer two benefits: acting as an [[expectorant]], since smoking increases mucus production in the lungs; or increasing the beneficial antioxidant [[glutathione]] (which is diminished in smokers).

===Reducing toxic effects of alcohol===
Cysteine has been proposed as a preventative or antidote for some of the negative effects of alcohol, including liver damage and [[hangover]]. It counteracts the poisonous effects of [[acetaldehyde]]. Cysteine supports the next step in metabolism, which turns acetaldehyde into the relatively harmless [[acetic acid]].  In a [[rat]] study, test animals received an {{LD50}} dose of acetaldehyde. Those that received cysteine had an 80% survival rate; when both cysteine and [[thiamine]] were administered, all animals survived.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sprince H, Parker CM, Smith GG, Gonzales LJ |title=Protection against acetaldehyde toxicity in the rat by L-cysteine, thiamin and L-2-methylthiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid |journal=Agents Actions |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=125–30 |date=April 1974 |pmid=4842541 |doi=10.1007/BF01966822}}</ref> No direct evidence indicates its effectiveness in humans who consume alcohol at low levels.

===''N''-Acetylcysteine===
[[N-Acetylcysteine|''N''-Acetyl-<small>L</small>-cysteine]] is a derivative of cysteine wherein an [[acetyl group]] is attached to the nitrogen atom.  This compound is sold as a dietary supplement, and used as an [[antidote]] in cases of [[acetaminophen]] overdose,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kanter MZ |title=Comparison of oral and i.v. acetylcysteine in the treatment of acetaminophen poisoning |journal=Am J Health Syst Pharm |volume=63 |issue=19 |pages=1821–7 |date=October 2006 |pmid=16990628 |doi=10.2146/ajhp060050}}</ref> and obsessive compulsive disorders such as [[trichotillomania]].

==Sheep==
Cysteine is required by [[sheep]] to produce wool: It is an essential amino acid that must be taken in from their feed.  As a consequence, during drought conditions, sheep produce less wool; however, [[transgenic]] sheep that can make their own cysteine have been developed.<ref name="Transgenic sheep">{{cite journal |vauthors=Powell BC, Walker SK, Bawden CS, Sivaprasad AV, Rogers GE |title=Transgenic sheep and wool growth: possibilities and current status |journal=Reprod. Fertil. Dev. |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=615–23 |year=1994 |pmid=7569041 |doi=10.1071/RD9940615}}</ref>

==Dietary restrictions==
The animal-originating sources of L-cysteine as a food additive are a point of contention for people following dietary restrictions such as Kosher, Halal, Vegan or Vegetarian.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kosher View of L-Cysteine|date=May 2003|publisher=kashrut.com|url=http://www.kashrut.com/articles/L_cysteine/}}</ref> To avoid this problem, L-cysteine can also be sourced from microbial or other synthetic processes.
