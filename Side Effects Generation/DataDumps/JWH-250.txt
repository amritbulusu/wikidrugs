'''JWH-250''' or ('''1-pentyl-3-(2-methoxyphenylacetyl)indole''') is an [[analgesic]] chemical from the [[phenylacetylindole]] family that acts as a [[cannabinoid]] [[agonist]] at both the [[Cannabinoid receptor 1|CB<sub>1</sub>]] and [[Cannabinoid receptor 2 (macrophage)|CB<sub>2</sub>]] receptors, with a [[Dissociation constant|''K''<sub>i</sub>]] of 11&nbsp;nM at CB<sub>1</sub> and 33&nbsp;nM at CB<sub>2</sub>. Unlike many of the older [[List of JWH cannabinoids|JWH series]] compounds, this compound does not have a [[naphthalene]] ring, instead occupying this position with a 2'-methoxy-phenylacetyl group, making JWH-250 a representative member of a new class of cannabinoid ligands.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Huffman |first= JW|title= 1-Pentyl-3-phenylacetylindoles, a new class of cannabimimetic indoles |journal= Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters |volume= 15 |issue= 18 |pages= 4110–3 |year= 2005 |pmid= 16005223  |doi= 10.1016/j.bmcl.2005.06.008 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> Other 2'-substituted analogues such as the [[JWH-251|methyl]], [[JWH-203|chloro]] and [[JWH-249|bromo]] compounds are also active and somewhat more potent.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Manera |first1= C |last2= Tuccinardi |first2= T |last3= Martinelli |first3= A |title= Indoles and related compounds as cannabinoid ligands |journal= Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry |volume= 8 |issue= 4 |pages= 370–87 |year= 2008 |pmid= 18473928 |doi= 10.2174/138955708783955935 }}</ref><ref>The Cannabinoid Receptors.

==History==
JWH-250 was discovered by, and named after the researcher Dr. [[John W. Huffman]]. He created JWH-250 and a number of other compounds to research the structure and function of the [[endocannabinoid]] system of [[mammal]]s. 
Samples of JWH-250 were first identified in May 2009 by the German Federal Criminal Police, as an ingredient in new generation "[[Spice (drug)|herbal smoking blends]]" that had been released since the banning of the original ingredients [[(C8)-CP 47,497]] and [[JWH-018]].<ref>[http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_80086_EN_Spice%20Thematic%20paper%20%E2%80%94%20final%20version.pdf Understanding the ‘Spice’ phenomenon. EMCDDA, Lisbon, November 2009]</ref> An ELISA immunoassay technique for detecting JWH-250 in urine has been reported.<ref>Arntson et al (2013) http://jat.oxfordjournals.org/content/37/5/284.abstract</ref>

==Legal Status==
===Australia===
JWH-250 is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the [[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons|Poisons Standard]] (October 2015).<ref name="Poisons Standard">Poisons Standard October 2015 https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2015L01534</ref> A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.<ref name="Poisons Standard" />
