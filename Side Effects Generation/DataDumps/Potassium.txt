'''Potassium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''K''' (from [[New Latin|Neo-Latin]] ''[[wikt:kalium#Latin|kalium]]'') and [[atomic number]]&nbsp;19. It was first isolated from [[potash]], the ashes of plants, from which its name derives. In the [[periodic table]], potassium is one of the [[alkali metal]]s. All of the alkali metals have a single [[valence electron]] in the outer electron shell, which is easily removed to create an ion with a positive charge – a [[cation]], which combines with [[anion]]s to form [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]]. Potassium in nature occurs only in ionic salts. Elemental potassium is a soft silvery-white alkali metal that [[redox|oxidizes]] rapidly in air and reacts vigorously with water, generating sufficient heat to ignite [[hydrogen]] emitted in the reaction and burning with a lilac-[[flame color|colored flame]].  It is found dissolved in sea water (which is 0.04% potassium by weight<ref name="seawaterconcentration">{{cite journal |journal= [[The Journal of Experimental Biology]] |url= http://jeb.biologists.org/content/jexbio/16/2/178.full.pdf |title=The Sodium and Potassium Content of Sea Water |first=D.

Potassium is chemically very similar to [[sodium]], the previous element in group 1 of the periodic table. They have a similar first [[ionization energy]], which allows for each atom to give up its sole outer electron. That they are different elements that combine with the same [[anion]]s to make similar salts was suspected in 1702,<ref name="1702Suspect" /> and was proven in 1807 using [[electrolysis]]. Naturally occurring potassium is composed of three [[isotope]]s, of which [[potassium-40|{{chem|40|K}}]] is [[radioactive]]. Traces of {{chem|40|K}} are found in all potassium, and it is the most common [[radioisotope]] in the human body.

Potassium ions are necessary for the function of all living cells. The transfer of potassium ions through nerve cell membranes is necessary for normal nerve transmission; potassium deficiency and excess can each result in numerous abnormalities, including an abnormal heart rhythm and various [[Electrocardiography|electrocardiographic]] (ECG) abnormalities. Fresh fruits and vegetables are good dietary sources of potassium. The body responds to the influx of dietary potassium, which raises serum potassium levels, with a shift of potassium from outside to inside cells and an increase in potassium excretion by the kidneys.

Most industrial applications of potassium exploit the high [[solubility]] in water of potassium compounds, such as [[Saltwater soap|potassium]] [[soap]]s. Heavy crop production rapidly depletes the soil of potassium, and this can be remedied with agricultural fertilizers containing potassium, accounting for 95% of global potassium chemical production.<ref name="g73">[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], p. 73</ref>

==Etymology==

The English '''name''' for the element ''potassium'' comes from the word "[[potash]]",<ref>{{cite journal|first=Humphry|last=Davy|title=On some new phenomena of chemical changes produced by electricity, in particular the decomposition of the fixed alkalies, and the exhibition of the new substances that constitute their bases; and on the general nature of alkaline bodies|page=32|year=1808|volume=98|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gpwEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA32|doi=10.1098/rstl.1808.0001}}</ref> which refers to an early method of extracting various potassium salts: placing in a ''pot'' the ''ash'' of burnt wood or tree leaves, adding water, heating, and evaporating the solution. When [[Humphry Davy]] first isolated the pure element using [[electrolysis]] in 1807, he named it ''potassium'' which he derived from the word potash.

The '''symbol''' "K" stems from ''kali'', itself from the root word ''[[alkali]]'', which in turn comes from ''{{lang-ar|القَلْيَه}}'' ''al-qalyah'' "plant ashes."  In 1797, the German chemist [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth | Martin Klaproth]] discovered "potash" in the minerals [[leucite]] and [[lepidolite]], and realized that "potash" was not a product of plant growth but actually contained a new element, which he proposed to call ''kali''.<ref>M. Klaproth (1797) "Nouvelles données relatives à l'histoire naturelle de l'alcali végétal" (New data regarding the natural history of the vegetable alkali), ''Mémoires de l'Académie royale des sciences et belles-lettres'' (Berlin), pp. 9-13 ; [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015073704093;view=1up;seq=103 see p. 13.]  From p. 13:  ''"Cet alcali ne pouvant donc plus être envisagé comme un produit de la végétation dans les plantes, occupe une place propre dans la série des substances primitivement simples du règne minéral, & il devient nécessaire de lui assigner un nom, qui convienne mieux à sa nature.<br>
''La dénomination de ''Potasche'' (potasse) que la nouvelle nomenclature françoise a consacrée comme nom de tout le genre, ne sauroit faire fortune auprès des chimistes allemands, qui sentent à quel point la dérivation étymologique en est vicieuse.  Elle est prise en effet de ce qu'anciennement on se servoit pour la calcination des lessives concentrées des cendres, de pots de fer (''pott'' en dialecte de la Basse-Saxe) auxquels on a substitué depuis des fours à calciner.<br>
''Je propose donc ici, de substituer aux mots usités jusqu'ici d'alcali des plantes, alcali végétal, potasse, &c. celui de ''kali'', & de revenir à l'ancienne dénomination de ''natron'', au lieu de dire alcali minéral, soude &c."''<br>
(This alkali [i.e., potash] — [which] therefore can no longer be viewed as a product of growth in plants — occupies a proper place in the originally simple series of the mineral realm, and it becomes necessary to assign it a name that is better suited to its nature.<br>
The name of "potash" (''potasse''), which the new French nomenclature has bestowed as the name of the entire species [i.e., substance], would not find acceptance among German chemists, who feel to some extent [that] the etymological derivation of it is faulty.  Indeed it is taken from [the vessels] that one formerly used for the roasting of washing powder concentrated from cinders: iron pots (''pott'' in the dialect of Lower Saxony), for which roasting ovens have been substituted since then.<br>
Thus I now propose to substitute for the until now common words of "plant alkali", "vegetable alkali", "potash", etc., that of ''kali'' ; and to return to the old name of ''natron'' instead of saying "mineral alkali", "soda", etc.)</ref> In 1807, [[Humphry Davy]] produced the element via electrolysis: in 1809, [[Ludwig Wilhelm Gilbert]] proposed the name ''Kalium'' for Davy's "potassium".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Davy, Humphry |year=1809|title=Ueber einige neue Erscheinungen chemischer Veränderungen, welche durch die Electricität bewirkt werden; insbesondere über die Zersetzung der feuerbeständigen Alkalien, die Darstellung der neuen Körper, welche ihre Basen ausmachen, und die Natur der Alkalien überhaupt|trans_title=On some new phenomena of chemical changes that are achieved by electricity; particularly the decomposition of flame-resistant alkalis [i.e., alkalies that cannot be reduced to their base metals by flames], the preparation of new substances that constitute their [metallic] bases, and the nature of alkalies generally|journal=Annalen der Physik|volume=31|issue=2|pages=113–175|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vyswAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA157|quote=p. 157:  In unserer deutschen Nomenclatur würde ich die Namen ''Kalium'' und ''Natronium'' vorschlagen, wenn man nicht lieber bei den von Herrn Erman gebrauchten und von mehreren angenommenen Benennungen ''Kali-Metalloid'' and ''Natron-Metalloid'', bis zur völligen Aufklärung der chemischen Natur dieser räthzelhaften Körper bleiben will.

==Properties==

===Physical===
[[File:FlammenfärbungK.png|thumb|left|The [[flame test]] of potassium.]]
Potassium is the second least dense metal after [[lithium]]. It is a soft solid with a low [[melting point]], and can be easily cut with a knife. Freshly cut potassium is silvery in appearance, but it begins to tarnish toward gray immediately on exposure to air.<ref name=g76>[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], p. 76</ref> In a [[flame test]], potassium and its compounds emit a lilac color with a peak emission wavelength of 766.5 nanometers.<ref>[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], p. 75</ref><!-- Potassium concentration in solution is commonly determined using [[photoelectric flame photometer|flame photometry]], [[atomic absorption spectrophotometry]], [[inductively coupled plasma]], or [[ion selective electrode]]s. -->

===Chemical===
Neutral potassium atoms have 19 electrons, one more than the extremely stable configuration of the [[noble gas]] [[argon]]. Because of this and its low first [[ionization energy]] of 418.8 kJ/mol, the potassium atom is much more likely to lose the last electron and acquire a positive charge than to gain one and acquire a negative charge (though negatively charged [[alkalide]] {{chem|K|−}} ions are not impossible).<ref name="K-">{{cite journal|journal = [[Angewandte Chemie International Edition]]|year = 1979|last = Dye|first=J.

P.|last2=Lord|title=Macmillan's chemical and physical data|publisher=Macmillan| location=London| date=1992|isbn=0-333-51167-0}}</ref> This process requires so little energy that potassium is readily oxidized by atmospheric oxygen. In contrast, the second ionization energy is very high (3052 kJ/mol), because removal of two electrons breaks the stable noble gas electronic configuration (the configuration of the inert argon).<ref name="K+++"/> Potassium therefore does not readily form compounds with the oxidation state of +2 or higher.<ref name="K-"/>

Potassium is an extremely active metal that reacts violently with oxygen in water and air. With oxygen it forms [[potassium peroxide]], and with water potassium forms [[potassium hydroxide]]. The reaction of potassium with water is dangerous because of its violent [[exothermic]] character and the production of [[hydrogen]] gas. Hydrogen reacts again with atmospheric oxygen, producing water, which reacts with the remaining potassium. This reaction requires only traces of water; because of this, potassium and the liquid sodium-potassium — [[NaK]] — are potent [[desiccant]]s that can be used to dry [[solvent]]s prior to distillation.<ref name=b35>[[#Burkhardt|Burkhardt]], p. 35</ref>

Because of the sensitivity of potassium to water and air, reactions with other elements are possible only in an inert atmosphere such as [[argon]] gas using [[air-free technique]]s. Potassium does not react with most hydrocarbons such as mineral oil or [[kerosene]].<ref name="HollemanAF">{{cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|date = 1985|edition = 91–100|isbn = 3-11-007511-3|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first1 = Arnold F.|last1 = Holleman|last2 = Wiberg|first2 = Egon|last3 = Wiberg|first3 = Nils|chapter = Potassium| language = German}}</ref> It readily dissolves in liquid [[ammonia]], up to 480 g per 1000 g of ammonia at 0&nbsp;°C. Depending on the concentration, the ammonia solutions are blue to yellow, and their electrical conductivity is similar to that of liquid metals. In a pure solution, potassium slowly reacts with ammonia to form {{chem|KNH|2}}, but this reaction is accelerated by minute amounts of transition metal salts.<ref name=b32>[[#Burkhardt|Burkhardt]], p. 32</ref> Because it can reduce the [[salt]]s to the metal, potassium is often used as the reductant in the preparation of finely divided metals from their salts by the [[Rieke metal|Rieke method]].<ref>{{cite journal| author=Rieke, R.

:[[Image:potassium-superoxide-unit-cell-3D-ionic.png|thumb|right|upright|Structure of solid potassium superoxide ({{chem|KO|2}}).]]
The only common oxidation state for potassium is +1. Potassium metal is a powerful [[reducing agent]] that is easily oxidized to the monopositive [[cation]], {{chem|K|+}}. Once oxidized, it is very stable and difficult to reduce back to the metal.<ref name="K-"/>

Potassium hydroxide reacts readily with carbon dioxide to produce [[potassium carbonate]], and is used to remove traces of the gas from air. In general, potassium compounds have excellent water solubility, owing to the high hydration energy of the {{chem|K|+}} ion. The potassium ion is colorless in water and is very difficult to [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]]; possible precipitation methods include reactions with [[sodium tetraphenylborate]], [[hexachloroplatinic acid]], and [[sodium cobaltinitrite]].<ref name="HollemanAF"/>

Potassium oxidizes faster than most metals and forms [[oxide]]s with oxygen-oxygen bonds, as do all alkali metals except lithium. Three species are formed during the reaction: [[potassium oxide]], [[potassium peroxide]], and [[potassium superoxide]]<ref>{{cite book|last = Lide|first = David R.|date = 1998|title = Handbook of Chemistry and Physics|edition = 87th|publication-place = Boca Raton, Florida, United States|publisher = CRC Press|isbn = 0-8493-0594-2|pages = 477; 520}}</ref> formed of three different oxygen-based ions: oxide ({{chem|O|2-}}), [[peroxide]] ({{chem|O|2|2-}}), and [[superoxide]] ({{chem|O|2|-}}).

Potash is primarily a mixture of potassium salts because plants have little or no sodium content, and the rest of a plant's major mineral content consists of calcium salts of relatively low solubility in water.

Potassium ''metal'' was first isolated in 1807 in England by Sir [[Humphry Davy]], who derived it from [[Potassium hydroxide|caustic potash]] (KOH, potassium hydroxide) by electrolysis of molten KOH with the newly discovered [[voltaic pile]].

==Geology==
Elemental potassium does not occur in nature because of its high reactivity. It reacts violently with water (see section Precautions below)<ref name="HollemanAF"/> and also reacts with oxygen. [[Orthoclase]] (potassium feldspar) is a common rock-forming mineral. [[Granite]] for example contains 5% potassium, which is well above the average in the Earth's crust. [[Sylvite]] (KCl), [[carnallite]] {{chem|(KCl·MgCl|2|·6(H|2|O))}}, [[kainite]] {{chem|(MgSO|4|·KCl·3H|2|O)}} and [[langbeinite]] {{chem|(MgSO|4|·K|2|SO|4|)}} are the minerals found in large [[evaporite]] deposits worldwide. The deposits often show layers starting with the least soluble at the bottom and the most soluble on top.<ref name="indus"/> Deposits of niter ([[potassium nitrate]]) are formed by decomposition of organic material in contact with atmosphere, mostly in caves; because of the good water solubility of niter the formation of larger deposits requires special environmental conditions.<ref>{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NyUDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA134|pages = 134–145| chapter = The Origin of Nitrate Deposits| first = William H.| last = Ross|title = Popular Science|date = 1914|publisher=Bonnier Corporation}}</ref>


==Biological role==
{{Main|Potassium in biology}}
Potassium is the eighth or ninth most common element by mass (0.2%) in the human body, so that a 60&nbsp;kg adult contains a total of about 120&nbsp;g of potassium.<ref>{{cite journal|doi = 10.1016/0883-2889(92)90208-V|title = A simple calibration of a whole-body counter for the measurement of total body potassium in humans|year = 1992|display-authors = 4|last1 = Abdel-Wahab|first1 = M.|last2 = Youssef|first2 = S.|last3 = Aly|first3 = A.|last4 = el-Fiki|first4 = S.|last5 = el-Enany|first5 = N.|last6 = Abbas|first6 = M.|journal = International Journal of Radiation Applications and Instrumentation.

===Homeostasis===
Potassium homeostasis denotes the maintenance of the total body potassium content, plasma potassium level, and the ratio of the intracellular to extracellular potassium concentrations within narrow limits, in the face of pulsatile intake (meals), obligatory renal excretion, and shifts between intracellular and extracellular compartments.

====Plasma levels====
Plasma potassium is normally kept at 3.5 to 5.0 millimoles (mmol) [or milliequivalents (mEq)] per liter by multiple mechanisms. Levels outside this range are associated with an increasing rate of death from multiple causes,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Goyal | first1 = Abhinav | last2 = Spertus | first2 = John A. | last3 = Gosch | first3 = Kensey | last4 = Venkitachalam | first4 = Lakshmi | last5 = Jones | first5 = Philip G. | last6 = Van den Berghe | first6 = Greet | last7 = Kosiborod | first7 = Mikhail | year = 2012 | title = Serum Potassium Levels and Mortality in Acute Myocardial Infarction | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 307 | issue = 2| pages = 157–164 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2011.1967 }}</ref> and some cardiac, kidney,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Smyth | first1 = A. | last2 = Dunkler | first2 = D. | last3 = Gao | first3 = P. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2014 | title = The relationship between estimated sodium and potassium excretion and subsequent renal outcomes | url = | journal = Kidney Int | volume = 86 | issue = | pages = 1205–1212 | doi=10.1038/ki.2014.214}}</ref> and lung diseases progress more rapidly if serum potassium levels are not maintained within the normal range.

An average meal of 40-50&nbsp;mmol presents the body with more potassium than is present in all plasma (20-25&nbsp;mmol). However, this surge causes the plasma potassium to rise only 10% at most as a result of prompt and efficient clearance by both renal and extra-renal mechanisms.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Moore-Ede | first1 = M. C. | year = 1986 | title = Physiology of the circadian timing system: predictive versus reactive homeostasis | url = | journal = Am J Physiol | volume = 250 | issue = | pages = R737–R752 }}</ref>

[[Hypokalemia]], a deficiency of potassium in the plasma, can be fatal if severe. Common causes are increased gastrintestinal loss ([[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]]), and increased renal loss ([[polyuria|diuresis]]).<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_XavFllbnS0C&pg=PA812|page = 812| chapter = Potassium|title = Pediatric critical care medicine|isbn = 978-0-7817-9469-5|last1 = Slonim|first1= Anthony D.|last2 = Pollack|first2= Murray M.|date = 2006}}</ref> Deficiency symptoms include muscle weakness, [[paralytic ileus]], ECG abnormalities, decreased reflex response; and in severe cases, respiratory paralysis, [[alkalosis]], and [[cardiac arrhythmia]].<ref>{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=c4xAdJhIi6oC&pg=PT257 |page =257|chapter = hypokalemia |title = Essentials of Nephrology|edition=2nd|publisher=BI Publications |isbn = 978-81-7225-323-3 |last1 = Visveswaran |first1= Kasi |date = 2009}}</ref>

====Control mechanisms====
Potassium content in the plasma is tightly controlled by four basic mechanisms, which have various names and classifications.  The four are 1) a reactive negative-feedback system, 2) a reactive feed-forward system, 3) a predictive or [[circadian]] system, and 4) an internal  or cell membrane transport system. Collectively, the first three are sometimes termed the "external potassium homeostasis system";{{Citation needed|date=May 2016|reason=internal cell mechanism is "external??  No citations found on web.}} and the first two, the "reactive potassium homeostasis system".
*The reactive negative-feedback system refers to the system that induces renal secretion of potassium in response to a rise in the plasma potassium (potassium ingestion, shift out of cells, or intravenous infusion.)
*The reactive feed-forward system refers to an incompletely understood system that induces renal potassium secretion in response to potassium ingestion prior to any rise in the plasma potassium. This is probably initiated by gut cell potassium receptors that detect ingested potassium and trigger [[vagal]] [[afferent nerve fiber|afferent]] signals to the pituitary gland.
*The predictive or circadian system increases renal secretion of potassium during mealtime hours (e.g. daytime for humans, nighttime for rodents) independent of the presence, amount, or absence of potassium ingestion. It is mediated by a [[circadian oscillator]] in the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] of the brain (central clock), which causes the kidney (peripheral clock) to secrete potassium in this rhythmic circadian fashion.[[File:Scheme sodium-potassium pump-en.svg|thumb|right|400px|The action of the [[sodium-potassium pump]] is an example of primary [[active transport]]. The two carrier proteins embedded in the cell membrane on the left are using [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to move sodium out of the cell against the concentration gradient; The two proteins on the right are using secondary active transport to move potassium into the cell: this process results in reconstitution of ATP.]]
*The ion transport system moves potassium across the cell membrane using two mechanisms. One is active and pumps sodium out of, and potassium into, the cell. The other is passive and allows potassium to leak out of the cell. Potassium and sodium cations influence fluid distribution between intracellular and extracellular compartments by [[osmotic]] forces. The movement of potassium and sodium through the cell membrane is mediated by the [[Na+/K+-ATPase]] pump.<ref>{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Neil|title=Biology|date=1987|isbn=0-8053-1840-2|page=795|publisher=Benjamin/Cummings Pub. Co.|location=Menlo Park, California}}</ref> This [[Ion transporter|ion pump]] uses [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to pump three sodium ions out of the cell and two potassium ions into the cell, creating an electrochemical gradient and electromotive force across the cell membrane. The highly selective [[potassium ion channels]] (which are [[tetramer]]s) are crucial for [[Hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarization]] inside [[neuron]]s after an action potential is triggered, to cite one example. The most recently discovered potassium ion channel is KirBac3.1, which makes a total of five potassium ion channels (KcsA, KirBac1.1, KirBac3.1, KvAP, and MthK) with a determined structure. All five are from [[prokaryotic]] species.<ref name="pmid16253415">{{cite journal|first1=Mikko |last1 = Hellgren| first2= Lars |last2= Sandberg|first3= Olle |last3= Edholm|title=A comparison between two prokaryotic potassium channels (K<sub>ir</sub>Bac1.1 and KcsA) in a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study|journal=Biophysical Chemistry| volume=120|issue=1|pages=1–9|year=2006|pmid=16253415|doi=10.1016/j.bpc.2005.10.002}}</ref>

====Renal filtration, reabsorption, and excretion====
Renal handling of potassium is closely connected to sodium handling. Potassium is the major cation (positive ion) inside animal cells [150&nbsp;mmol/L, (4.8&nbsp;g)], while sodium is the major cation of extracellular fluid [150&nbsp;mmol/L, (3.345&nbsp;g)]. In the kidneys, about 180&nbsp;liters of plasma is filtered through the [[glomeruli]] and into the [[renal tubules]] per day.<ref name="Potts1964">{{cite book|author=Potts, W. T. W.|author2=Parry, G.|date=1964|title=Osmotic and ionic regulation in animals|publisher=[[Pergamon Press]]}}</ref> This filtering involves about 600&nbsp;g of sodium and 33&nbsp;g of potassium. Since only 1–10&nbsp;g of sodium and 1–4&nbsp;g of potassium are likely to be replaced by diet, renal filtering must efficiently reabsorb the remainder from the plasma.

Sodium is reabsorbed to maintain extracellular volume, osmotic pressure, and serum sodium concentration within narrow limits; potassium is reabsorbed to maintain serum potassium concentration within narrow limits.<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Lans |first1=H.

Potassium must be conserved also, but, because the amount of potassium in the blood plasma is very small and the pool of potassium in the cells is about thirty times as large, the situation is not so critical for potassium.

The potassium moves passively through pores in the cell membrane. When ions move through pumps there is a gate in the pumps on either side of the cell membrane and only one gate can be open at once. As a result, approximately 100 ions are forced through per second. Pores have only one gate, and there only one kind of ion can stream through, at 10 million to 100 million ions per second.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gadsby |first=D.

==Nutrition==

===Dietary recommendations===
The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) sets Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs), or [[Adequate Intake]]s (AIs) for when there is not sufficient information to set EARs and RDAs. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s. The current AI for potassium for women and men ages 14 and up is 4700&nbsp;mg. AI for pregnancy equals 4700&nbsp;mg/day. AI for lactation equals 5100&nbsp;mg/day. For infants 0–6 months 400&nbsp;mg, 6–12 months 700&nbsp;mg, 1–13 years increasing from 3000 to 4500 mg/day. As for safety, the IOM also sets [[Tolerable upper intake level]]s (ULs) for vitamins and minerals, but for potassium the evidence was insufficient, so no UL established.<ref>Potassium. IN: [https://www.nap.edu/read/10925/chapter/7 Dietary Reference Intakes for Water, Potassium, Sodium, Chloride, and Sulfate]. National Academy Press. 2005, PP.186-268.</ref>

Most Americans consume only half that amount per day.<ref name=iom_panel2005>{{cite book|author=Panel on Dietary Reference Intakes for Electrolytes and Water, Standing Committee on the Scientific Evaluation of Dietary Reference Intakes, Food and Nutrition|title=DRI, dietary reference intakes for water, potassium, sodium, chloride, and sulfate|date=2004|publisher=National Academies Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-309-53049-0|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224183110/http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2004/Dietary-Reference-Intakes-Water-Potassium-Sodium-Chloride-and-Sulfate.aspx}}</ref> 

Likewise, in the [[European Union]], in particular in [[Germany]] and [[Italy]], insufficient potassium intake is somewhat common.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Karger|first=S.|journal=Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism|year=2004|volume=48|issue=2 (suppl) |pages=1–16 |title=Energy and nutrient intake in the European Union|doi=10.1159/000083041}}</ref>  However, the British National Health Service recommends a lower intake, saying that adults need 3,500&nbsp;mg per day and that excess amounts may cause health problems such as stomach pain and diarrhoea.<ref>http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vitamins-minerals/Pages/Other-vitamins-minerals.aspx#potassium NHS Choices - Other vitamins and minerals - Potassium</ref>

===Food sources===
Adequate potassium intake is achieved by eating a variety of foods. Potassium is present in all fruits, vegetables, meat and fish. Foods with high potassium concentrations include [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[parsley]], dried [[apricot]]s, [[milk]], [[chocolate]], all [[nut (fruit)|nuts]] (especially [[almond]]s and [[pistachio]]s), [[potato]]es, [[bamboo shoot]]s, [[banana]]s, [[avocado]]s, [[coconut water]], [[soybean]]s, and [[bran]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://apjcn.nhri.org.tw/server/info/books-phds/books/foodfacts/html/data/data5b.html|title = Potassium Food Charts|publisher =Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition|accessdate = 2011-05-18}}</ref> Dried apricots have the highest concentration of potassium by weight of any food. Many processed foods contain no potassium.

The [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] lists [[tomato paste]], [[orange juice]], [[beet greens]], [[white beans]], [[potato]]es, [[banana]]s and many other dietary sources of potassium, ranked in descending order according to potassium content.<ref>{{cite news|title=Potassium Content of Selected Foods per Common Measure, sorted by nutrient content |publisher=USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 20 |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/Data/SR20/nutrlist/sr20w306.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217043521/http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/Data/SR20/nutrlist/sr20w306.pdf |archivedate=December 17, 2008 }}</ref>

===Deficient intake===
Diets low in potassium can lead to [[hypertension]]<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Whelton PK, He J, Cutler JA, Brancati FL, Appel LJ, Follmann D, Klag MJ |title=Effects of oral potassium on blood pressure. Meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials |journal=JAMA |volume=277 |issue=20 |pages=1624–32 |year=1997 |pmid=9168293 |doi=10.1001/jama.1997.03540440058033 }}</ref> and [[hypokalemia]].

===Supplementation===
Supplements of potassium are most widely used in conjunction with [[diuretic]]s that block reabsorption of sodium and water upstream from the [[distal tubule]] ([[thiazide]]s and [[loop diuretics]]), because this promotes increased distal tubular potassium secretion, with resultant increased potassium excretion. A variety of prescription and over-the counter supplements are available.  Potassium chloride may be dissolved in water, but the salty/bitter taste make liquid supplements unpalatable.<ref name=bitter/> Typical doses range from 10&nbsp;mmol (400&nbsp;mg), to 20&nbsp;mmol (800&nbsp;mg).  Potassium is also available in tablets or capsules, which are formulated to allow potassium to leach slowly out of a matrix, since very high concentrations of potassium ion that occur adjacent to a solid tablet can injure the gastric or intestinal mucosa. For this reason, non-prescription potassium pills are limited by law in the US to a maximum of 99&nbsp;mg of potassium.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Since the kidneys are the site of potassium excretion, individuals with impaired kidney function are at risk for [[hyperkalemia]] if dietary potassium and supplements are not restricted. The more severe the impairment, the more severe is the restriction necessary to avoid hyperkalemia.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Detection by taste buds===
Potassium can be detected by taste because it triggers three of the five types of taste sensations, according to concentration. Dilute solutions of potassium ions taste sweet, allowing moderate concentrations in milk and juices, while higher concentrations become increasingly bitter/alkaline, and finally also salty to the taste. The combined bitterness and saltiness of high-potassium solutions makes high-dose potassium supplementation by liquid drinks a palatability challenge.<ref name=bitter>{{cite book|author1=Institute of Medicine (U.S.).

===Chemical extraction===
Several methods are used to separate potassium salts from sodium and magnesium compounds. The most-used method is fractional precipitation using the solubility differences of the salts at different temperatures. Electrostatic separation of the ground salt mixture is also used in some mines. The resulting sodium and magnesium waste is either stored underground or piled up in [[slag heap]]s. Most of the mined potassium mineral ends up as [[potassium chloride]] after processing. The mineral industry refers to potassium chloride either as potash, muriate of potash, or simply MOP.<ref name="indus"/>

Pure potassium metal can be isolated by [[electrolysis]] of its [[potassium hydroxide|hydroxide]] in a process that has changed little since it was first used by [[Humphry Davy]] in 1807. Although the electrolysis process was developed and used in industrial scale in the 1920s, the thermal method by reacting sodium with [[potassium chloride]] in a chemical equilibrium reaction became the dominant method in the 1950s.

The production of [[NaK|sodium potassium alloys]] is accomplished by changing the reaction time and the amount of sodium used in the reaction. The Griesheimer process employing the reaction of [[potassium fluoride]] with [[calcium carbide]] was also used to produce potassium.<ref name="indus" /><ref>{{cite book|doi=10.1002/0471238961.1615200103080921.a01.pub2|isbn= 9780471238966

===Fertilizer===
[[File:Patentkali (Potassium sulfate with magnesium).jpg|thumb|Potassium sulfate/magnesium sulfate fertilizer]]
Potassium ions are an essential component of [[plant]] nutrition and are found in most [[soil]] types.<ref name=g73/> They are used as a [[fertilizer]] in [[agriculture]], [[horticulture]], and [[hydroponic]] culture in the form of [[potassium chloride|chloride]] (KCl), [[potassium sulfate|sulfate]] ({{chem|K|2|SO|4}}), or [[potassium nitrate|nitrate]] ({{chem|KNO|3}}). Agricultural fertilizers consume 95% of global potassium chemical production, and about 90% of this potassium is supplied as KCl.<ref name=g73/> The potassium content of most plants range from 0.5% to 2% of the harvested weight of crops, conventionally expressed as amount of {{chem|K|2|O}}. Modern high-[[Crop yield|yield]] agriculture depends upon fertilizers to replace the potassium lost at harvest. Most agricultural fertilizers contain potassium chloride, while potassium sulfate is used for chloride-sensitive crops or crops needing higher sulfur content. The sulfate is produced mostly by decomposition of the complex minerals [[kainite]] ({{chem|MgSO|4|·KCl·3H|2|O}}) and [[langbeinite]] ({{chem|MgSO|4|·K|2|SO|4}}). Only a very few fertilizers contain potassium nitrate.<ref name="Kent">{{cite book|pages = 1135–57|first = Amit H. |last = Roy| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AYjFoLCNHYUC&pg=PA1135|isbn = 978-0-387-27843-8|publisher=Springer|title = Kent and Riegel's handbook of industrial chemistry and biotechnology|date = 2007}}</ref> In 2005, about 93% of world potassium production was consumed by the fertilizer industry.<ref name="USGSYB2006" />

==Precautions==
[[File:Potassium water 20.theora.ogv|thumb|alt=A piece of potassium metal is dropped into a clear container of water and skates around, burning with a bright pinkish or lilac flame for a short time until finishing with a pop and splash.|A reaction of potassium metal with water. Hydrogen is produced, and with potassium vapor, burns with a pink or lilac flame. Strongly alkaline potassium hydroxide is formed in solution.]]

Potassium metal reacts violently with water producing [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) and [[hydrogen]] gas.

:2 K (s) + 2 {{H2O}} (l) → 2 KOH (aq) + {{chem|H|2}}↑ (g)

This reaction is exothermic and releases enough heat to ignite the resulting hydrogen in the presence of oxygen, possibly explosively splashing onlookers with [[potassium hydroxide]], which is a strong [[alkali]] that destroys living tissue and causes skin burns. Finely grated potassium ignites in air at room temperature. The bulk metal ignites in air if heated. Because its density is 0.89 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, burning potassium floats in water that exposes it to atmospheric oxygen. Many common fire extinguishing agents, including water, either are ineffective or make a potassium fire worse. [[Nitrogen]], [[argon]], [[sodium chloride]] (table salt), [[sodium carbonate]] (soda ash), and [[silicon dioxide]] (sand) are effective if they are dry. Some [[Fire extinguisher|Class D]] dry powder extinguishers designed for metal fires are also effective. These agents deprive the fire of oxygen and cool the potassium metal.<ref>{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2fHsoobsCNwC&pg=PA459|page = 459| title = Fire and Life Safety Inspection Manual| isbn = 978-0-87765-472-8|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning| last = Solomon |first=Robert E.| date = 2002}}</ref>

Potassium reacts violently with [[halogens]] and detonates in the presence of [[bromine]]. It also reacts explosively with [[sulfuric acid]]. During combustion, potassium forms peroxides and superoxides. These peroxides may react violently with [[organic compound]]s such as oils. Both peroxides and superoxides may react explosively with metallic potassium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hss.doe.gov/nuclearsafety/ns/techstds/standard/hdbk1081/hbk1081d.html |title=DOE Handbook-Alkali Metals Sodium, Potassium, NaK, and Lithium |publisher=Hss.doe.gov |accessdate=2010-10-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928002539/http://www.hss.doe.gov/nuclearsafety/ns/techstds/standard/hdbk1081/hbk1081d.html <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archivedate=2010-09-28}}</ref>

Because potassium reacts with water vapor in the air, it is usually stored under anhydrous mineral oil or kerosene. Unlike lithium and sodium, however, potassium should not be stored under oil for longer than 6 months, unless in an inert (oxygen free) atmosphere, or under vacuum. After prolonged storage in air dangerous shock-sensitive peroxides can form on the metal and under the lid of the container, and can detonate upon opening.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729111002/https://www.ncsu.edu/ehs/www99/right/handsMan/lab/Peroxide.pdf|title=Danger: peroxidazable chemicals|last=Wray |first=Thomas K. |publisher=Environmental Health & Public Safety, [[North Carolina State University]]}}</ref>

Because of the highly reactive nature of potassium metal, it must be handled with great care, with full skin and eye protection and preferably an explosion-resistant barrier between the user and the metal. Ingestion of large amounts of potassium compounds can lead to [[hyperkalemia]] strongly influencing the cardiovascular system.<ref name="hyper">{{cite book|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BfdighlyGiwC&pg=PA903| chapter = Potassium Chloride and Potassium Permanganate|pages = 903–5|title = Medical toxicology|isbn = 978-0-7817-2845-4|last = Schonwald|first = Seth|date = 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=l8RkPU1-M5wC&pg=PA223|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|page =223|title =Emergency medicine secrets|isbn =978-1-56053-503-4|last =Markovchick |first=Vincent J.|last2 =Pons |first2=Peter T.|last-author-amp =yes|date =2003}}</ref> Potassium chloride is used in the [[United States]] for [[lethal injection]] executions.<ref name="hyper"/>
