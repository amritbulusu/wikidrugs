'''Tylenol''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|aɪ|l|ə|n|ɒ|l}} is a brand of [[drug]]s advertised for reducing [[analgesic|pain]], reducing [[fever]], and relieving the symptoms of [[allergy|allergies]], [[common cold|cold]], [[cough]] headache, and [[influenza]]. The active ingredient of its original flagship product is [[acetaminophen]] (known in most [[Commonwealth nations]] as ''paracetamol''), an [[analgesic]] and [[antipyretic]].  Like the words ''acetaminophen'' and ''paracetamol'', the brand name ''Tylenol'' is derived from the chemical name for the compound, ''N''-ace'''TYL'''-''para''-aminoph'''ENOL''' (APAP).<ref>{{cite web |first=Nancy |last=West |title=History of TYLENOL |publisher=Nancy West Communications |url=http://www.nancywest.net/pdfs/McNeilConsumerHealthcareCompany.pdf |accessdate=July 26, 2014}}</ref> The brand name is owned by [[McNeil Consumer Healthcare]], a subsidiary of [[Johnson & Johnson]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Euromonitor International |url=http://www.marketresearchworld.net/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=751&Itemid= |title=Acetaminophen benefits from concerns surrounding safety of analgesics |publisher=Market Research World |accessdate=July 26, 2014}}</ref>

==History==
The brand was introduced in 1955 by McNeil Laboratories, a family owned pharmaceutical manufacturer.  Two brothers took over the company from their father that year, and that year one of them learned about paracetamol, which was not on the US market at that time. To avoid competing with [[aspirin]], they marketed it as a product to reduce fever in children, packaging it like a red fire truck with the slogan, "for little hotheads".   The name "Tylenol" and the generic name "acetaminophen" were generated by McNeil from the chemical name of the drug.  [[Johnson & Johnson]] bought McNeil in 1959, and one year later the drug was made available [[over the counter]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Stephen|title=Creator  of  Tylenol 'For Little Hotheads'|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748704026204575266780552207418|work=Wall Street Journal|date=26 May 2010}}</ref>

===Recalls===
====1982 Chicago Tylenol murders====
{{Main|Chicago Tylenol murders}}
On September 29, 1982, a "Tylenol scare" began when the first of seven individuals died in the [[Chicago metropolitan area]] after ingesting Extra Strength Tylenol that had been deliberately contaminated with [[cyanide]]. Within a week, the company pulled 31 million bottles of tablets back from retailers, making it one of the first major [[product recall]]s in American history.<ref name="nytrecall">''[[New York Times]]'' article: "[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/23/your-money/23iht-mjj_ed3_.html?pagewanted=1 Tylenol made a hero of Johnson & Johnson : The recall that started them all]."</ref>

As a result of the crisis, all Tylenol [[Capsule (pharmacy)|capsules]] were discontinued, as were capsules of other brand names. Retained by [[McNeil Consumer Healthcare|McNeil's president, Joseph Chiesa]], new product consultant Martin Calle of management strategist Calle & Company conceived the world's first [[tamper-resistant]] gelatin-enrobed capsule called "Tylenol Gelcaps," which proved to resuscitate the 92% of capsule-segment sales lost to the recall. The tamper-resistant, triple-sealed safety containers were swiftly placed on the shelves of retailers 10 weeks after the withdrawal, and other manufacturers followed suit. The crisis cost the company more than $100 million, but Tylenol regained 100% of the market share it had before the crisis. The Tylenol murderer was never found, and a $100,000 reward offered by [[Johnson & Johnson]] remains unclaimed.

Before the poisonings, Tylenol brands held around 35% of the US market for acetaminophen and in the immediate aftermath, fell to 8%.   Within a year sales had rebounded to the prior levels.<ref name=PBS/>  J&J's handling of the crisis has been widely cited as an example of optimal crisis management.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dezenhall|first=E.|title=Tylenol Can't Cure All Crisis|date=2004-03-17|accessdate=2007-10-08|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2004-03-17-dezenhall_x.htm}}</ref>

These events led to the widespread use of [[tamper resistance]] packaging of drugs by drug companies, to the 1982 passage of a US federal law making [[tampering (crime)|tampering]] a crime, and to legislation in 1989 requiring tamper-proof packaging.<ref name=PBS>{{cite news|last1=Markel|first1=Howard|title=How the Tylenol murders of 1982 changed the way we consume medication|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/tylenol-murders-1982/|work=PBS NewsHour|date=September 29, 2014}}</ref>

On January 15, 2010, Johnson & Johnson announced a voluntary recall of several hundred batches of popular medicines, including Benadryl, Motrin, Rolaids, Simply Sleep, St. Joseph Aspirin and Tylenol.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/18/business/18drug.html In Recall, a Role Model Stumbles], Natasha Singer, ''New York Times'', January 17, 2010</ref> The recall was due to complaints of a musty smell suspected to be due to contamination of the packaging with the chemical [[2,4,6-tribromoanisole]].<ref>[http://arthritis.webmd.com/news/20091229/tylenol-recall-expands Tylenol recall expands], WebMD, accessed 1-17-2010.</ref> The full health effects of 2,4,6-tribromoanisole are not known but no serious events have been documented in medical literature.<ref name=jnj>{{cite web|url=http://www.jnj.com/connect/news/all/20100115_100000|title=Media Center Main - Johnson & Johnson|publisher=|accessdate=10 December 2016}}</ref> The recall came 20 months after McNeil first began receiving and investigating consumer complaints about moldy-smelling bottles of Tylenol Arthritis Relief caplets, according to the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). The recall included 53 million bottles of over-the-counter products including Tylenol, Motrin and Rolaids, Benadryl and St. Joseph's Aspirin, involving lots in the Americas, the United Arab Emirates and [[Fiji]].<ref name="reuters.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0412564320100504|title=FACTBOX-Johnson & Johnson's recent product recalls|author=Reuters Editorial|date=4 May 2010|work=Reuters}}</ref>

On April 30, 2010, [[2010 Johnson & Johnson children's product recall|another recall]] was issued for 40 products including liquid infant and children's pain relievers, Tylenol, and [[Motrin]] and allergy medications [[Zyrtec]] and [[Benadryl]].<ref name="reuters.com"/> An FDA report said its inspectors found thick dust and grime covering certain equipment, a hole in the ceiling, and duct tape-covered pipes at the [[Fort Washington, Pennsylvania]], facility that made 40 products recalled.

The CDC has stated that ''Burkholderia cepacia'' is not likely to cause health problems for those with healthy immune systems, but those with weaker ones and those with chronic lung diseases, such as [[cystic fibrosis]], could be more susceptible to infection.

Tylenol has many different advertisement approaches. One of these advertisement campaigns focuses on "getting you back to normal", whereas the other commercials focus on Tylenol's current slogan, "Feel better, Tylenol". In the "Feel better, Tylenol" commercials, Tylenol places emphasis on the importance of sleep; various people are seen sleeping in this commercial while a voiceover describes how sleep can help repair and heal the human body during times of aches and pains.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xgKJyyRFW0|title=Midori's Tylenol Commercial|date=23 August 2009|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> In the "getting you back to normal" commercial, Tylenol places more emphasis on helping its consumers get back to their daily routines; many different people are shown first experiencing headaches and other sorts of body pain, where a voiceover then states that Tylenol Rapid Release can help rid aches and pains; the various people are then showed enjoying their everyday lives, and are seen as "back to normal".<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMo_dmUrW2A|title=Tylenol Rapid Release - Suzumiya Haruhi|date=12 September 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>

In an older commercial from 1986, Tylenol emphasized that it is the drug that American hospitals trust the most. In this ad, [[Susan Sullivan]] told the consumer that Tylenol was a drug that could be trusted by Americans since many doctors also trusted it; she went on to state that doctors prescribed Tylenol four times more often than other leading pain relieving drugs combined.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6EBNti7Vo0|title=Tylenol Commercial (1986)|date=19 August 2007|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>

A form that contains [[dextromethorphan]], [[pseudoephedrine]], acetaminophen, and [[chlorpheniramine]], is sold as Cotylenol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catalog.md/drugs/co-tylenol.html|title=Co-Tylenol Drug Information, Indications & Other Medicaments on Catalog.md|publisher=|accessdate=10 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-55368/cotylenol-oral/details|title=CoTylenol oral : Uses, Side Effects, Interactions, Pictures, Warnings & Dosing - WebMD|publisher=|accessdate=10 December 2016}}</ref>
