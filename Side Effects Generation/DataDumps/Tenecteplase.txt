'''Tenecteplase''' (sold under the trade name '''TNKase''') is an [[enzyme]] used as a [[thrombolytic drug]].

Tenecteplase is a [[tissue plasminogen activator]] (tPA) produced by recombinant DNA technology using an established mammalian cell line ([[Chinese hamster ovary]] cells). Tenecteplase is a 527 amino acid glycoprotein developed by introducing the following modifications to the complementary DNA (cDNA) for natural human tPA: a substitution of threonine 103 with asparagine, and a substitution of asparagine 117 with glutamine, both within the kringle 1 domain, and a tetra-alanine substitution at amino acids 296–299 in the protease domain.

Tenecteplase is a recombinant fibrin-specific plasminogen activator that is derived from native t-PA by modifications at three sites of the protein structure. It binds to the fibrin component of the thrombus (blood clot) and selectively converts thrombus-bound plasminogen to plasmin, which degrades the fibrin matrix of the thrombus. Tenecteplase has a higher fibrin specificity and greater resistance to inactivation by its endogenous inhibitor ([[Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1|PAI-1]]) compared to native  t-PA.

The abbreviation '''TNK''' is common for referring to tenecteplase, but abbreviating drug names is not [[best practice]] in medicine, and in fact "TNK" is one of the examples given on the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) do-not-use list.

==Research==

Researchers at Newcastle University in Australia say they have had a significant breakthrough in treating stroke patients using the commonly used drug.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Parsons M, Spratt N, Bivard A, Campbell B, Chung K, Miteff F, O'Brien B, Bladin C, McElduff P, Allen C, Bateman G, Donnan G, Davis S, Levi C | title = A randomized trial of tenecteplase versus alteplase for acute ischemic stroke | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 366 | issue = 12 | pages = 1099–107  | date = Mar 2012 | pmid = 22435369 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1109842 }}</ref> The findings were published in the New England Medical Journal. There is ongoing controversy about whether this is a harmful treatment, and significant ongoing discussion between Emergency Physicians and Neurologists about whether this treatment should be used at all.

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Distribution: approximates plasma volume

Metabolism: Primarily hepatic

Half-life elimination: Biphasic: Initial: 20–24 minutes; Terminal: 90–130 minutes

| Here is TNK-tPA. It is very similar to t-PA, but the glycosylation occurring in Kringle 1 is manipulated. The mutation T103N means that glycosylation occurs at that point. The mutation N117E means that the high mannose sugar residue is absent at that point
| File:T-PA 296-299.png
| In human t-PA, the amino acids at position 296-299 are [[Lysine]], [[Histidine]], and two [[Arginine]]s.
| File:TNK-tPA 296-299.png
| In TNK-tPA, these amino acids have been replaced by four [[Alanine]]s. This mutation is responsible for increased resistance to [[PAI-1]].
