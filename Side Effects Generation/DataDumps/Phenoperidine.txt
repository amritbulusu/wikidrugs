'''Phenoperidine''' ('''Operidine''' or '''Lealgin'''), is an [[opioid]] used as a [[general anesthetic]].

==Medical use==
Phenoperidine is an [[opioid]] pain killer -- [[narcotic analgesic]]. {{mcn|date=December 2014}}

==Pharmacology==
It is a derivative of [[isonipecotic acid]], like [[pethidine]], and is metabolized in part to [[norpethidine]]. It's potency range is due to method of ingestion. figure 20-80 times as potent as pethidine as an [[analgesic]]. The greatly increased potency essentially eliminates the toxic effects of norpethidine accumulation which are seen when pethidine is administered in high doses or for long periods of time.<ref>'Bioactive Carboxylic Compound Classes: Pharmaceuticals and Agrochemicals By' by Clemens Lamberth. page 29</ref>

==History and Synthesis==
Phenoperidine was first synthesized in 1957 by [[Paul Janssen]], of the company now known as [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]], who was seeking better [[opioid]] pain-killers.<ref name=JanssenHist>{{cite journal|last1=Lopez-Munoz|first1=Francisco|last2=Alamo|first2=Cecilio|title=The Consolidation of Neuroleptic Therapy: Janssen, the Discovery of Haloperidol and Its Introduction into Clinical Practice|journal=Brain Research Bulletin|date=2009|volume=79|pages=130–141|pmid=19186209|doi=10.1016/j.brainresbull.2009.01.005}}</ref>  His two prototype drugs were [[methadone]] and  [[pethidine]], each which had been invented in 1930s by Otto Eisleb, who worked for [[IG Farben]]. His initial work starting with methadone yielded [[dextromoramide]] in 1954. Janssen then turned to making pethidine analogues, due in part to the less complicated chemistry of the compound.  During his explorations, he replaced the methyl group attached to the pethidine nitrogen with a [[propiophenone]] group, and this yielded phenoperidine, in 1957. Phenoperidine was determined to have decreased stability and enhanced lipophilicity compared to pethidine. Soon after, studies in mice showed that phenoperidine was over 100 times more potent than pethidine.<ref name=JanssenHist/>

In 1958, the same line of work yielded  “one of the greatest advances of the 20th century psychiatry", [[haloperidol]],<ref name=JanssenHist/> as well as [[diphenoxylate]], which lacked the opioid's analgesic properties but still stopped [[peristalsis]] in the intestines, a typical side effect of opioids; Janssen brought diphenoxylate to market as a drug to treat diarrhea.<ref>Walter Sneade. Drug Discovery: A History. John Wiley & Sons, 2005 {{ISBN|9780471899792}}</ref>{{rp|124}}  And through further advances, Janssen created [[fentanyl]] in 1960, which proved to be ten times more potent than phenoperidine.<ref name="Fentanyl">{{cite journal|last1=Stanley|first1=Theodore|title=The Fentanyl Story|journal=The Journal of Pain|date=2014|volume=15|issue=12|pages=1215–1226|doi=10.1016/j.jpain.2014.08.010}}</ref>

==Historical Uses==
In 1959, the combination of phenoperidine and [[haloperidol]] was first used in Europe in [[anesthesia]] to induce a detached, pain free state called [[Neuroleptanalgesic|Neuroleptic analgesia]]; the use of that mixture boomed in early 1960s but was overtaken by the combination of [[fentanyl]] and [[droperidol]], which was widely used through the 1980s.  These combination approaches were not adopted in the US.<ref>Edmond I Eger II, Lawrence Saidman, Rod Westhorpe. The Wondrous Story of Anesthesia.  Springer Science & Business Media, 2013 {{ISBN|9781461484417}}</ref>{{rp|644}}

==Regulations==
In 1961 phenoperidine was added to the 1931 [[Convention for Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs]] by the [[World Health Organization]] via the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]].<ref>WHO Technical Report Series No. 211. 1961 [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_211.pdf  Expert Committee on Addiction-Producing Drugs. Eleventh Report.]</ref><ref>WHO Executive Board. 17 April 1961 [http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/136008/1/EB28_2_eng.pdf Action in Respect of the International Convention on Narcotic Drugs.]</ref>

In the US it is classified as a schedule 1 opiate and is categorized as a [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) controlled substance with a corresponding code 9641.<ref name="FDA">{{cite web|title=Memo: Overview of the September 14, 2010, DSaRM Advisory Committee Meeting to Discuss the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Request for an Abuse Potential Evaluation and Scheduling Recommendation for Dextromethorphan (DXM) |url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/advisorycommittees/committeesmeetingmaterials/drugs/drugsafetyandriskmanagementadvisorycommittee/ucm224446.pdf|website=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref>
