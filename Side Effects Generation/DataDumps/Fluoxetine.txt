===Depression===
The effectiveness of fluoxetine and other [[antidepressant]]s in the treatment of mild-to-moderate [[major depressive disorder|depression]] is controversial. A [[meta-analysis]] published by Kirsch in 2008 suggests, in those with mild or moderate symptoms, the efficacy of fluoxetine and other SSRIs is clinically insignificant.<ref name=KIRSCH2008>{{cite journal|last=Kirsch|first=Irving|title=Initial Severity and Antidepressant Benefits: A Meta-Analysis of Data Submitted to the Food and Drug Administration|publisher=PLoS Med|pmc=2253608|year=2008|last2=Deacon|first2=BJ|last3=Huedo-Medina|first3=TB|last4=Scoboria|first4=A|last5=Moore|first5=TJ|last6=Johnson|first6=BT|volume=5|issue=2|pages=e45|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050045|journal=PLoS Medicine|pmid=18303940}}</ref> A 2009 meta-analysis by Fournier which evaluated patient-level data from six trials of the SSRI [[paroxetine]] and the non-SSRI antidepressant [[imipramine]] has been further cited as evidence that antidepressants exhibit minimal efficacy in mild to moderate depression.<ref name=JAMA2010>{{cite journal|author1=Jay C.

A 2009 systematic review by the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence|National Institute of Care and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE) (which considered the Kirsch, but not the later meta-analyses) concluded strong evidence existed for the efficacy of SSRIs in the treatment of moderate and severe depression, with some evidence for their efficacy in the treatment of mild depression.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG90/Guidance/pdf/English|title=CG90 Depression in adults: full guidance|format=PDF|work=[[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]]|accessdate=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109171623/http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG90/Guidance/pdf/English|archivedate=9 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  Both the NICE and the Fournier analyses concluded that greater evidence is seen for the efficacy of antidepressants in the treatment of chronic mild depression ([[dysthymia]]) than in recent-onset mild depression.

NICE recommends antidepressant treatment with an SSRI in combination with psychosocial interventions as second-line treatment for short term mild depression, and as a first line treatment for severe and moderate depression, as well as mild depression that is recurrent or long-standing. The [[American Psychiatric Association]] includes antidepressant therapy among its first-line options for the treatment of depression, particularly when  "a history of prior positive response to antidepressant medications, the presence of moderate to severe symptoms, significant sleep or appetite disturbances, agitation, patient preference, and anticipation of the need for maintenance therapy" exist.<ref>[http://psychiatryonline.org/content.aspx?bookID=28&sectionID=1667485#654260 ]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===Obsessive-compulsive disorder===
The [[efficacy]] of fluoxetine in the treatment of [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD) was demonstrated in two randomized multicenter [[Clinical trial#Phases|phase III clinical trials]].

===Panic disorder===
The efficacy of fluoxetine in the treatment of [[panic disorder]] was demonstrated in two 12-week randomized multicenter [[Clinical trial#Phases|phase III clinical trials]] that enrolled patients diagnosed with panic disorder, with or without [[agoraphobia]].  In the first trial, 42% of subjects in the fluoxetine-treated arm were free of panic attacks at the end of the study, vs. 28% in the placebo arm.

Per the [[FDA]], infants exposed to [[SSRI]]s in late pregnancy may have an increased risk for [[Persistent fetal circulation|persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn]].

===Sexual dysfunction===
{{See also|Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor#Sexual dysfunction}}
Sexual dysfunction, including loss of libido, anorgasmia, lack of vaginal lubrication, and erectile dysfunction, is one of the most commonly encountered adverse effects of treatment with fluoxetine and other SSRIs. While early clinical trials suggested a relatively low rate of sexual dysfunction, more recent studies in which the investigator actively inquires about sexual problems suggest that the incidence is >70%.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Clark MS, Jansen K, Bresnahan M |title=Clinical inquiry: How do antidepressants affect sexual function? |journal=J Fam Pract |volume=62 |issue=11 |pages=660–1 |date=November 2013  |pmid=24288712 |doi= |url=}}</ref>  Symptoms of sexual dysfunction have been reported to persist after discontinuing SSRIs, although this is thought to be occasional.<ref name=ProzacLabel2014/><ref name=Csoka2008>{{cite journal |vauthors=Csoka AB, Csoka A, Bahrick A, Mehtonen OP | title = Persistent sexual dysfunction after discontinuation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors | journal = The Journal of Sexual Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 227–33 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18173768 | doi = 10.1111/j.1743-6109.2007.00630.x }}</ref><ref name=Csoka2006>{{cite journal |vauthors=Csoka AB, Shipko S | title = Persistent sexual side effects after SSRI discontinuation | journal = Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = 187–8 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16636635 | doi = 10.1159/000091777 | url = http://www.mediafire.com/view/hn31cmg4n28bq3x/06_pssd_Csoka.pdf | accessdate = 30 January 2014 }}</ref>

===Discontinuation syndrome===
[[Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome]] is an adverse effect of second generation anti-depressants, including fluoxetine. The symptoms appear with rapid discontinuation of one of these drugs, and can include dizziness, disturbance of balance, headache, nausea, insomnia, and vivid dreams. Others can include [[paraesthesia|sensations of tingling or numbness]], ‘electric-shock’-like sensations, and irritability, with some case reports of hallucinations.  They can generally be prevented by tapering off the drug over a period of four weeks, although evidence is weak for optimal tapering and there is disagreement between experts over the schedule. If a person is informed of the risk of discontinuation syndrome prior to starting the drug and again prior to beginning any tapering, discontinuation symptoms appear to be fewer and less severe, but again evidence is weak. Slower-acting drugs, like fluoxetine, may be less likely to cause discontinuation symptoms, but the evidence for this is weak as well. The mechanism by which discontinuation syndrome occurs in some people is not well understood.<ref name=Wilson2015rev>{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=E|last2=Lader|first2=M|title=A review of the management of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms.|journal=Therapeutic advances in psychopharmacology|date=December 2015|volume=5|issue=6|pages=357–68|pmid=26834969|pmc=4722507}}</ref>

There is less data on fluoxetine than on antidepressants as a whole. For the above analysis on the antidepressant level, the FDA had to combine the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants for psychiatric indications to obtain [[statistically significant]] results.

==Interactions==
Contraindications include prior treatment (within the past two weeks) with [[monoamine oxidase inhibitors|MAOI]]s such as [[phenelzine]] and [[tranylcypromine]], due to the potential for [[serotonin syndrome]].<ref name = TGA/> Its use should also be avoided in those with known hypersensitivities to fluoxetine or any of the other ingredients in the formulation used.<ref name = TGA/> Its use in those concurrently receiving [[pimozide]] or [[thioridazine]] is also advised against.<ref name = TGA/>

In some cases, use of [[dextromethorphan]]-containing cold & cough medications with fluoxetine is advised against, due to fluoxetine increasing serotonin levels, as well as  the fact that fluoxetine is a cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitor, which causes dextromethorphan to not be metabolized at a normal rate, thus increasing the risk of serotonin syndrome and other potential side effects of dextromethorphan.<ref name="Drugs.com 1">{{cite web |url=https://www.drugs.com/drug-interactions/dextromethorphan-with-fluoxetine-844-0-1115-0.html |title=Dextromethorphan and fluoxetine Drug Interactions |website=Drugs.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814134442/https://www.drugs.com/drug-interactions/dextromethorphan-with-fluoxetine-844-0-1115-0.html |archivedate=14 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

=== Pharmacodynamics ===
Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and does not appreciably inhibit [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]] reuptake at therapeutic doses. It does, however, delay the reuptake of serotonin, resulting in serotonin persisting longer when it is released. Large doses in rats have been shown to induce a significant increase in synaptic norepinephrine and dopamine.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01285563 |title=Fluoxetine increases norepinephrine release in rat hypothalamus as measured by tissue levels of MHPG-SO4 and microdialysis in conscious rats|year=1997 |last1=Perry |first1=K.

The extremely slow elimination of fluoxetine and its active metabolite norfluoxetine from the body distinguishes it from other antidepressants. With time, fluoxetine and norfluoxetine inhibit their own metabolism, so fluoxetine [[elimination half-life]] changes from 1 to 3&nbsp;days, after a single dose, to 4 to 6&nbsp;days, after long-term use.<ref name = TGA/> Similarly, the half-life of norfluoxetine is longer (16&nbsp;days) after long-term use.<ref name="RxList"/><ref name="pmid10917403">{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00004714-200008000-00006|title=Weekly Dosing of Fluoxetine for the Continuation Phase of Treatment of Major Depression: Results of a Placebo-Controlled, Randomized Clinical Trial |year=2000 |last1=Burke |first1=William J. |last2=Hendricks |first2=Shelton E. |last3=McArthur-Miller|first3=Delores |last4=Jacques |first4=Daniel |last5=Bessette |first5=Diane |last6=McKillup |first6=Tracy |last7=Stull |first7=Todd|last8=Wilson |first8=James |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=423–7 |pmid=10917403}}</ref><ref name="Newcastle">{{cite web |url = http://www.ncl.ac.uk/nnp/teaching/management/drugrx/antdep.html |title = Drug Treatments in Psychiatry: Antidepressants |year = 2005 |accessdate = April 14, 2007 |publisher = [[Newcastle University]] School of Neurology, Neurobiology and Psychiatry |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070417161229/http://www.ncl.ac.uk/nnp/teaching/management/drugrx/antdep.html |archivedate = 17 April 2007 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> Therefore, the concentration of the drug and its active metabolite in the blood continues to grow through the first few weeks of treatment, and their steady concentration in the blood is achieved only after four weeks.<ref name="pmid11199945">{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00004714-200102000-00008 |title=Augmentation of Fluoxetine's Antidepressant Action by Pindolol: Analysis of Clinical, Pharmacokinetic, and Methodologic Factors |year=2001 |last1=Pérez |first1=Victor |last2=Puiigdemont|first2=Dolors |last3=Gilaberte |first3=Inmaculada |last4=Alvarez |first4=Enric |last5=Artigas |first5=Francesc |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology |volume=21 |pages=36–45 |pmid=11199945 |author6=Grup de Recerca en Trastorns Afectius |issue=1}}</ref><ref name="pmid12063152">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0165-0327(00)00333-5 |title=Fluoxetine and norfluoxetine plasma concentrations during relapse-prevention treatment |year=2002 |last1=Brunswick |first1=David J. |last2=Amsterdam |first2=Jay D. |last3=Fawcett |first3=Jan|last4=Quitkin |first4=Frederic M. |last5=Reimherr |first5=Frederick W. |last6=Rosenbaum |first6=Jerrold F. |last7=Beasley Jr|first7=Charles M. |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=68 |issue=2–3 |pages=243–9 |pmid=12063152}}</ref> Moreover, the brain concentration of fluoxetine and its metabolites keeps increasing through at least the first five weeks of treatment.<ref name="pmid15886723">{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1300749 |title=A Comparison of Brain and Serum Pharmacokinetics of R-Fluoxetine and Racemic Fluoxetine: A 19-F MRS Study |year=2005 |last1=Henry |first1=Michael E |last2=Schmidt |first2=Mark E |last3=Hennen|first3=John |last4=Villafuerte |first4=Rosemond A |last5=Butman |first5=Michelle L |last6=Tran |first6=Pierre |last7=Kerner |first7=Lynn T |last8=Cohen |first8=Bruce |last9=Renshaw |first9=Perry F  |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=30 |issue=8 |pages=1576–83|pmid=15886723}}</ref> That means that the full benefits of the current dose a patient receives are not realized for at least a month since its initiation.

===Measurement in body fluids===
Fluoxetine and norfluoxetine may be quantitated in blood, plasma or serum to monitor therapy, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma fluoxetine concentrations are usually in a range of 50–500&nbsp;μg/L in persons taking the drug for its antidepressant effects, 900–3000 μg/L in survivors of acute overdosage and 1000–7000&nbsp;μg/L in victims of fatal overdosage. Norfluoxetine concentrations are approximately equal to those of the parent drug during chronic therapy, but may be substantially less following acute overdosage, since it requires at least 1–2 weeks for the metabolite to achieve equilibrium.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=3871765 |year=1985 |last1=Lemberger |first1=L |last2=Bergstrom |first2=RF |last3=Wolen |first3=RL|last4=Farid |first4=NA |last5=Enas |first5=GG |last6=Aronoff |first6=GR |title=Fluoxetine: Clinical pharmacology and physiologic disposition |volume=46 |issue=3 Pt 2 |pages=14–9 |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=1741813|year=1991 |last1=Pato |first1=MT |last2=Murphy |first2=DL |last3=Devane |first3=CL |title=Sustained plasma concentrations of fluoxetine and/or norfluoxetine four and eight weeks after fluoxetine discontinuation |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=224–5 |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology |doi=10.1097/00004714-199106000-00024}}</ref><ref>R.

==History==

The work which eventually led to the discovery of fluoxetine began at Eli Lilly and Company in 1970 as a collaboration between [[Bryan Molloy]] and Robert Rathbun. It was known at that time that the [[antihistamine]] [[diphenhydramine]] shows some antidepressant-like properties. 3-Phenoxy-3-phenylpropylamine, a compound structurally similar to diphenhydramine, was taken as a starting point, and Molloy synthesized dozens of its derivatives.<ref name=Wong>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0024-3205(95)00209-O |title=Prozac (fluoxetine, lilly 110140), the first selective serotonin uptake inhibitor and an antidepressant drug: Twenty years since its first publication |year=1995 |last1=Wong |first1=David T. |last2=Bymaster |first2=Frank P. |last3=Engleman |first3=Eric A. |journal=Life Sciences |volume=57 |issue=5 |pages=411–41 |pmid=7623609}}</ref>  Hoping to find a derivative inhibiting only [[serotonin]] reuptake, an Eli Lilly scientist, [[David T.

The other permitted antidepressants are [[sertraline]] (Zoloft), [[citalopram]] (Celexa), and [[escitalopram]] (Lexapro).<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=11293 |title=FAA Proposes New Policy on Antidepressants for Pilots |first1=Alison |last1=Duquette |first2=Les |last2=Dorr |publisher=Federal Aviation Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation |location=Washington, DC |date=April 2, 2010 |accessdate=February 10, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114140705/http://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=11293 |archivedate=14 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> These four remain the only antidepressants permitted by FAA {{As of|2016|12|2|lc=y|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/aam/ame/guide/app_process/exam_tech/item47/amd/antidepressants/|post=.}}<ref>{{cite web |author1=Office of Aerospace Medicine |author2=Federal Aviation Administration |author2-link=Federal Aviation Administration |date=December 2, 2016 |title=Decision Considerations – Aerospace Medical Dispositions: Item 47.
