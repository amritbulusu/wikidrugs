'''Diclofenac''' (sold under a number of trade names)<ref name=tn/> is a [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] (NSAID) taken or applied to reduce [[inflammation]] and as an [[analgesic]] reducing pain in certain conditions. It is supplied as or contained in medications under a variety of trade names.

The name "diclofenac" derives from its chemical name: 2-(2,6-'''dic'''h'''lo'''ranilino) '''phen'''yl'''ac'''etic acid. Diclofenac was first synthesized by Alfred Sallmann and Rudolf Pfister and introduced as '''Voltaren''' by Ciba-Geigy (now [[Novartis]]) in 1973.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 4445819 | pmid=25963327 | doi=10.1007/s40265-015-0392-z | volume=75 | title=Advances in NSAID development: evolution of diclofenac products using pharmaceutical technology | year=2015 | journal=Drugs | pages=859–77 |vauthors=Altman R, Bosch B, Brune K, Patrignani P, Young C }}</ref>

In the United Kingdom, United States, India, and Brazil diclofenac may be supplied as either the [[sodium]] or [[potassium]] [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]]; in China, it is most often supplied as the sodium salt, while in some other countries it is only available as the potassium salt. It is available as a generic drug in a number of formulations, including diclofenac [[diethylamine]], which is applied topically. [[Over-the-counter substance|Over-the-counter]] (OTC) use is approved in some countries for minor aches and pains and fever associated with common infections. As of 2015 the cost for a typical month of medication in the United States is 50 to 100 USD.  In Europoean countries, the cost is no more than £8.40 ( approx. $10 US ) for 24 weeks use. <ref name=Ric2015>{{cite book|last1=Hamilton|first1=Richart|title=Tarascon Pocket Pharmacopoeia 2015 Deluxe Lab-Coat Edition|date=2015|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning|isbn=9781284057560|page=7}}</ref>

The drug's use in animals is controversial due to its toxicity which can rapidly kill scavenging birds that eat dead animals. It has been banned for veterinary use in many countries.

==Medical uses==
Diclofenac is used to treat [[pain]], inflammatory disorders, and [[dysmenorrhea]].<ref name=AHFS>{{cite web|title=Diclofenac Epolamine|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/diclofenac-epolamine.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref>

===Pain===
Inflammatory disorders may include musculoskeletal complaints, especially [[arthritis]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[polymyositis]], [[dermatomyositis]], [[osteoarthritis]], dental pain, [[temporomandibular joint]] (TMJ) pain, [[spondylarthritis]], [[ankylosing spondylitis]], [[gout]] attacks,<ref name="BPC">{{cite web |title=RUFENAL |publisher=Birzeit Pharmaceutical Company |url=http://www.bpc.ps/products/prod_desc/72.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526184251/http://www.bpc.ps/products/prod_desc/72.html |archivedate=2011-05-26 |df= }}</ref> and [[pain management]] in cases of [[kidney stone]]s and [[gallstone]]s. An additional indication is the treatment of acute [[migraine]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cambiarx.com/|title=Patient Site - CAMBIA (diclofenac potassium) for oral solution|website=cambiarx}}</ref> Diclofenac is used commonly to treat mild to moderate postoperative or post-traumatic pain, in particular when inflammation is also present,<ref name=BPC/> and is effective against menstrual pain and [[endometriosis]].

Diclofenac is also available in topical forms and has been found to be useful for [[osteoarthritis]] but not other types of long-term musculoskeletal pain.<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Dutta| first1=NK| last2=Mazumdar| first2=K| last3=Dastidar| first3=SG| last4=Park| first4=JH| title=Activity of diclofenac used alone and in combination with streptomycin against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in mice.|journal=International journal of antimicrobial agents| date=October 2007| volume=30| issue=4| pages=336–40| pmid=17644321| doi=10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2007.04.016}}</ref>

It may also help with [[actinic keratosis]], and acute pain caused by minor strains, sprains, and contusions (bruises).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/drug-information/DR600545|title=Diclofenac (Topical Application Route) Description and Brand Names - Mayo Clinic|website=www.mayoclinic.com}}</ref>

In many countries,<ref>[http://db.cbg-meb.nl/IB-teksten/h12800.pdf cbg-meb.nl], SPC Netherlands</ref> eye drops are sold to treat acute and chronic nonbacterial inflammation of the anterior part of the eyes (e.g., postoperative states). Diclofenac eye drops have also been used to manage pain for [[corneal abrasion|traumatic corneal abrasion]].<ref name="Wakai">{{cite journal |authors=Wakai A, Lawrenson JG, Lawrenson AL, Wang Y, Brown MD, Quirke M, Ghandour O, McCormick R, Walsh CD, Amayem A, Lang E, Harrison N |title= Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for analgesia in traumatic corneal abrasions |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume=5 |pages= CD009781 |date=2017 |pmid= 28516471 |doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD009781.pub2}}</ref>

Diclofenac is often used to treat chronic pain associated with [[cancer]], in particular if inflammation is also present (Step I of the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization (WHO)]] scheme for treatment of chronic pain).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/cancer/palliative/painladder/en/|title=WHO - WHO's cancer pain ladder for adults|website=www.who.int}}</ref> Diclofenac can be combined with opioids if needed such as a fixed combination of diclofenac and [[codeine]].

===Other===
Diclofenac has been found to increase the blood pressure in patients with [[Shy–Drager syndrome]] and [[diabetes mellitus]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Currently, this use is highly investigative and cannot be recommended as routine treatment.

==Side effects==
Diclofenac consumption has been associated with significantly increased vascular and coronary risk in a study including coxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen.<ref name="BhalaEmbersonEtAl">{{cite journal |last1=Bhala |first1=N. |last2=Emberson |first2=J. |displayauthors=etal |url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)60900-9/fulltext |title=Vascular and upper gastrointestinal effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: meta-analyses of individual participant data from randomised trials |journal=The Lancet |volume=382 |issue=9894 |pages=769–779 |year=2013 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60900-9 |pmid=23726390 |pmc=3778977}}</ref> Upper gastrointestinal complications were also reported.<ref name="BhalaEmbersonEtAl" /> Major vascular events were increased by about a third by diclofenac, chiefly due to an increase in major coronary events.<ref name="BhalaEmbersonEtAl" /> Compared with placebo, of 1000 patients allocated to diclofenac for a year, three more had major vascular events, one of which was fatal.<ref name="BhalaEmbersonEtAl" /> Vascular death was increased significantly by diclofenac.<ref name="BhalaEmbersonEtAl" />

===Cardiac===
In 2013, a study funded by core grants from the UK Medical Research Council and the British Heart Foundations, and collaboration coordinated by the Clinical Trial Service Unit & Epidemiological Studies Unit (CTSU) at the University of Oxford, UK; major vascular events were increased by about a third by diclofenac (rate ratio 1·41,95% CI 1·12–1·78; p=0·0036), chiefly due to an increase in major coronary events (1·70, 1·19–2·41; p=0·0032).<ref name="BhalaEmbersonEtAl" /> Compared with placebo, of 1000 patients allocated to diclofenac for a year, three more had major vascular events, one of which was fatal.<ref name="BhalaEmbersonEtAl" /> Vascular death was increased significantly by diclofenac (1·65, 0·95–2·85, p=0·0187).<ref name="BhalaEmbersonEtAl" />

Following the identification of increased risks of heart attacks with the selective [[COX-2 inhibitor]] [[rofecoxib]] in 2004, attention has focused on all the other members of the NSAIDs group, including diclofenac. Research results are mixed, with a meta-analysis of papers and reports up to April 2006 suggesting a relative increased rate of heart disease of 1.63 compared to nonusers.<ref name="BMJ2006-Kearney">{{cite journal |authors=Kearney PM, Baigent C, Godwin J, Halls H, Emberson JR, Patrono C |title=Do selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors and traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs increase the risk of atherothrombosis? Meta-analysis of randomised trials |journal=BMJ |volume=332 |issue=7553 |pages=1302–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16740558 |pmc=1473048 |doi=10.1136/bmj.332.7553.1302}}</ref> Professor Peter Weissberg, Medical Director of the British Heart Foundation said, "However, the increased risk is small, and many patients with chronic debilitating pain may well feel that this small risk is worth taking to relieve their symptoms". Only [[aspirin]] was found not to increase the risk of heart disease; however, this is known to have a higher rate of gastric ulceration than diclofenac.

A subsequent large study of 74,838 users of NSAIDs or [[coxib]]s found no additional cardiovascular risk from diclofenac use.<ref name="ArthritisRheum2006-Solomon">{{cite journal |authors=Solomon DH, Avorn J, Stürmer T, Glynn RJ, Mogun H, Schneeweiss S |title=Cardiovascular outcomes in new users of coxibs and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs: high-risk subgroups and time course of risk |journal=Arthritis Rheum |volume=54 |issue=5 |pages=1378–89 |year=2006 |pmid=16645966 |doi=10.1002/art.21887}}</ref> A very large study of 1,028,437 Danish users of various NSAIDs or coxibs found the "Use of the nonselective NSAID diclofenac and the selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor rofecoxib was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death (odds ratio, 1.91; 95% confidence interval, 1.62 to 2.42; and odds ratio, 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 2.59, respectively), with a dose-dependent increase in risk."<ref name="pmid20530789">{{cite journal |authors=Fosbøl EL, Folke F, Jacobsen S, Rasmussen JN, Sørensen R, Schramm TK, Andersen SS, Rasmussen S, Poulsen HE, Køber L, Torp-Pedersen C, Gislason GH |title=Cause-Specific Cardiovascular Risk Associated With Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs Among Healthy Individuals |journal=Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=395–405 |year=2010 |pmid=20530789 |doi=10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.109.861104}}</ref> In Britain the [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] (MHRA) said in June 2013 that the drug should not be used by people with serious underlying heart conditions—people who had suffered heart failure, heart disease or a stroke were advised to stop using it completely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-23109314|title=Heart risk warning over painkiller|date=29 June 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> As of January 15, 2015 the MHRA announced that diclofenac will be reclassified as a prescription-only medicine (POM) due to the risk of cardiovascular adverse events.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/NewsCentre/Pressreleases/CON500341 |title=Press release: Diclofenac tablets now only available as a prescription medicine |date=January 14, 2015 |accessdate=January 14, 2015 |website=Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency |publisher= }}</ref>

===Gastrointestinal===
* Gastrointestinal complaints are most often noted. The development of ulceration and/or bleeding requires immediate termination of treatment with diclofenac. Most patients receive a gastro-protective drug as prophylaxis during long-term treatment ([[misoprostol]], [[ranitidine]] 150&nbsp;mg at bedtime or [[omeprazole]] 20&nbsp;mg at bedtime).

===Hepatic===
* Liver damage occurs infrequently, and is usually reversible. [[Hepatitis]] may occur rarely without any warning symptoms and may be fatal. Patients with [[osteoarthritis]] more often develop symptomatic liver disease than patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Liver function should be monitored regularly during long-term treatment. If used for the short-term treatment of pain or fever, diclofenac has not been found more hepatotoxic than other NSAIDs.
* As of December 2009, Endo, Novartis, and the US FDA notified healthcare professionals to add new warnings and precautions about the potential for elevation in liver function tests during treatment with all products containing diclofenac sodium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm193047.htm|title=fda.gov|publisher=}}</ref>
* Cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. [[Postmarketing surveillance]] has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation.
* Physicians should measure transaminases periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 week after initiating treatment with diclofenac.

===Renal===

* NSAIDs "are associated with adverse renal [kidney] effects caused by the reduction in synthesis of renal prostaglandins"<ref name="Brater2002">{{cite journal |authors=Brater DC |title=Renal effects of cyclooxygyenase-2-selective inhibitors |journal=J Pain Symptom Manage |volume=23 |issue=4 Suppl |pages=S15–20; discussion S21–3 |year=2002 |pmid=11992745 |doi=10.1016/S0885-3924(02)00370-6}}</ref> in sensitive persons or animal species, and potentially during long-term use in nonsensitive persons if resistance to side effects decreases with age. However, this side effect cannot be avoided merely by using a COX-2 selective inhibitor because, "Both isoforms of COX, COX-1 and COX-2, are expressed in the kidney... Consequently, the same precautions regarding renal risk that are followed for nonselective NSAIDs should be used when selective COX-2 inhibitors are administered."<ref name="Brater2002" /> However, diclofenac appears to have a different mechanism of renal toxicity.
* Studies in Pakistan showed diclofenac caused acute kidney failure in vultures when they ate the carcasses of animals that had recently been treated with it. Drug-sensitive species and individual humans are initially assumed to lack genes expressing specific drug detoxification enzymes.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/cattle-drug-threatens-thousands-of-vultures-1.19839|title=Cattle drug threatens thousands of vultures|first=Rachel|last=Becker|publisher=|journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/nature.2016.19839}}</ref>

===Mental health===
*Mental health side effects have been reported. These symptoms are rare, but exist in significant enough numbers to include as potential side effects. These include depression, anxiety, irritability, nightmares, and psychotic reactions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drugs.com/sfx/diclofenac-side-effects.html |title=Diclofenac Side Effects |work=Drugs.com |accessdate=21 January 2013 |date= }}</ref>

===Other===
* Diclofenac and other NSAIDs can cause temporary infertility in women,<ref>NSAIDS, Aspirin & Infertility http://www.fertilityplus.com/faq/nsaids.html</ref> particularly those who take it regularly. NSAIDs have been known to cause luteinized unruptured follicle syndrome, which delays or prevents ovulation.<ref>Infertility May Sometimes Be Associated with NSAID Consumption http://rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/1/76.full.pdf</ref>
* Bone marrow depression is noted infrequently ([[leukopenia]], [[agranulocytosis]], [[thrombopenia]] with/without purpura, [[aplastic anemia]]). These conditions may be life-threatening and/or irreversible, if detected too late. All patients should be monitored closely. Diclofenac is a weak and reversible inhibitor of thrombocytic aggregation needed for normal coagulation.
*It induces warm antibody hemolytic anemia by inducing antibodies to Rh antigens; [[ibuprofen]] also does this.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec11/ch131/ch131b.html?qt=diclofenac&alt=sh#sec11-ch131-ch131b-174|title=Cutaneous Larva Migrans - Dermatologic Disorders - Merck Manuals Professional Edition|publisher=}}</ref>
* Diclofenac may disrupt the normal menstrual cycle.
* Research (published 2010) has linked use of diclofenac to an increased risk of [[stroke]].<ref>ABC News: Study links Voltaren to strokes http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/09/14/3011102.htm</ref>
* Research (published 2014) has been reported by Pongkorpsakol and co-workers, Diclofenac may be useful to treat diarrhea. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25188334]</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
The primary mechanism responsible for its [[anti-inflammatory]], [[antipyretic]], and [[analgesic]] action is thought to be inhibition of [[prostaglandin]] synthesis by inhibition of [[cyclooxygenase]] (COX). It also appears to exhibit bacteriostatic activity by inhibiting bacterial DNA synthesis.<ref name="Dutta2000">{{cite journal | authors = Dastidar SG, Ganguly K, Chaudhuri K, Chakrabarty AN | title = The anti-bacterial action of diclofenac shown by inhibition of DNA synthesis | journal = Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 249–51 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10773497 | doi = 10.1016/S0924-8579(99)00159-4 }}</ref>

Inhibition of COX also decreases prostaglandins in the [[epithelium]] of the stomach, making it more sensitive to corrosion by [[gastric acid]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} This is also the main side effect of diclofenac. Diclofenac has a low to moderate preference to block the COX2-isoenzyme (approximately 10-fold) and is said to have, therefore, a somewhat lower incidence of gastrointestinal complaints than noted with [[indomethacin]] and [[aspirin]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The action of one single dose is much longer (6 to 8 hr) than the very short half-life of the drug indicates.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} This could be partly because it persists for over 11 hours in [[synovial fluid]]s.<ref name="pmid6628528">{{cite journal | authors = Fowler PD, Shadforth MF, Crook PR, John VA | title = Plasma and synovial fluid concentrations of diclofenac sodium and its major hydroxylated metabolites during long-term treatment of rheumatoid arthritis | journal = Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol. | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 389–94 | year = 1983 | pmid = 6628528 | doi = 10.1007/BF01037953 }}</ref>

Diclofenac may also be a unique member of the NSAIDs. Some evidence indicates it inhibits the [[lipoxygenase]] pathways,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} thus reducing formation of the [[leukotriene]]s (also pro-inflammatory [[autacoid]]s). It also may inhibit [[phospholipase|phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>]] as part of its mechanism of action. These additional actions may explain its high potency - it is the most potent NSAID on a broad basis.<ref>Scholer. Pharmacology of Diclofenac Sodium. Am J of Medicine Volume 80 April 28, 1986</ref>

Marked differences exist among NSAIDs in their selective inhibition of the two subtypes of cyclooxygenase, [[COX-1]] and [[COX-2]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Much pharmaceutical drug design has attempted to focus on selective COX-2 inhibition as a way to minimize the gastrointestinal side effects of NSAIDs such as aspirin. In practice, use of some [[COX-2 inhibitor]]s with their [[Adverse drug reaction|adverse effects]] has led to massive numbers of patient family lawsuits alleging wrongful death by [[heart attack]], yet other significantly COX-selective NSAIDs, such as diclofenac, have been well tolerated by most of the population.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Besides the COX-inhibition, a number of other molecular targets of diclofenac possibly contributing to its pain-relieving actions have recently been identified. These include:
* Blockage of voltage-dependent sodium channels (after activation of the channel, diclofenac inhibits its reactivation also known as phase inhibition){{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}
* Blockage of acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs)<ref>Voilley N, de Weille J, Mamet J, Lazdunski M: Nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit both the activity and the inflammation-induced expression of acid-sensing ion channels in nociceptors. J Neurosci. 2001 Oct 15;21(20):8026-33.</ref>
* Positive allosteric modulation of KCNQ- and BK-potassium channels (diclofenac opens these channels, leading to hyperpolarization of the cell membrane){{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

"The loss of tens of millions of vultures over the last decade has had major ecological consequences across the Indian Subcontinent that pose a potential threat to human health. In many places, populations of feral [[dog]]s (''Canis familiaris'') have increased sharply from the disappearance of ''[[Gyps]]'' vultures as the main scavenger of wild and domestic [[ungulate]] carcasses. Associated with the rise in dog numbers is an increased risk of [[rabies]]"<ref name="Swan2006"/> and casualties of almost 50,000 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19926684.400-rabies-tragedy-follows-loss-of-indias-vultures.html?DCMP=ILC-hmts&nsref=news&pagewanted=print10_head_mg19926684.400|title=Rabies tragedy follows loss of India’s vultures|publisher=}}</ref> The Government of India cites this as one of those major consequences of a vulture species extinction.<ref name="PIB2005"/> A major shift in transfer of corpse pathogens from vultures to feral dogs and rats could lead to a disease pandemic causing millions of deaths in a crowded country like India; whereas vultures’ digestive systems safely destroy many species of such pathogens.

The loss of vultures has had a social impact on the Indian [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] Parsi community, who traditionally use vultures to dispose of human corpses in [[Tower of Silence|Towers of Silence]], but are now compelled to seek alternative methods of disposal.<ref name="Swan2006"/>
