'''Ferring Holding SA''', better known as '''Ferring Pharmaceuticals''', is a multinational [[pharmaceutical company]] that specializes in the development and marketing of [[drugs]] for use in [[human]] [[medicine]].

==History==

The company was founded by [[Frederik Paulsen Sr]] in [[Malmö]], [[Sweden]], in 1950, initially as the '''Nordiska Hormon Laboratoriet''', renamed '''Ferring''' in 1954.  A ''ferring'' in [[North Frisian|Frisian]] is a person from the island [[Föhr]] off the western coast of Germany. Mr. Paulsen's family originates from that island.

The first major breakthrough was the synthetic production of [[oxytocin]] and [[vasopressin]] in 1961. With further growth and expansion, the headquarters moved to [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], and subsequently to [[Switzerland]].

In August 2016, the company announced it would acquire the phase III [[sciatica]] candidate drug - [[Condoliase]] (SI-6603) from [[Seikagaku]] for approximately $95 million.<ref>http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/ferring-acquires-sciatica-candidate-from-seikagaku-for-up-to-95m/81253141/</ref>
