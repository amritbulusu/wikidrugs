'''Viloxazine''' (trade names '''Vivalan''', '''Emovit''', '''Vivarint''' and '''Vicilan''') is a [[morpholine]] derivative and is a selective [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] (NRI). It was used as an [[antidepressant]] in some European countries, and produced a stimulant effect that is similar to the [[amphetamines]], except without any signs of dependence.  It was discovered and brought to market in 1976 by [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] and was withdrawn from the market in the early 2000s for business reasons.

== Uses ==
Viloxazine hydrochloride was used in some European countries for the treatment of [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]].<ref name=Pinder>{{cite journal|last1=Pinder|first1=RM|last2=Brogden|first2=RN|last3=Speight|first3=™|last4=Avery|first4=GS|title=Viloxazine: a review of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic efficacy in depressive illness.|journal=Drugs|date=June 1977|volume=13|issue=6|pages=401–21|doi=10.2165/00003495-197713060-00001|pmid=324751}}</ref><ref name=Dahmen/>

== Mechanism of action ==
Viloxazine, like [[imipramine]], inhibited norepinephrine reuptake in the hearts of rats and mice; unlike imipramine, it did not block reuptake of norepinephrine in either the [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]]e or the [[hypothalamus|hypothalami]] of rats. As for [[serotonin]], while its reuptake inhibition was comparable to that of desipramine (i.e., very weak), viloxazine did potentiate serotonin-mediated brain functions in a manner similar to amitriptyline and imipramine, which are relatively potent inhibitors of serotonin reuptake.<ref name=viloxazine_serotonin/> Unlike any of the other drugs tested, it did not exhibit any anticholinergic effects.<ref name=viloxazine_serotonin>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lippman W, Pugsley TA |title=Effects of viloxazine, an antidepressant agent, on biogenic amine uptake mechanisms and related activities |journal=Canadian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology |volume=54 |issue=4 |pages=494–509 |date=August 1976 |pmid=974878 |doi=10.1139/y76-069}}</ref>

==Chemical properties==

==History==
Viloxazine was discovered by scientists at [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] when they recognized that some [[beta blockers]] inhibited [[serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] activity in the brain at high doses.  To improve the ability of their compounds to cross the [[blood brain barrier]], they changed the [[ethanolamine]] side chain of beta blockers to a [[morpholine]] ring, leading to the synthesis of viloxazine.<ref name=Williams>Williams DA.

==Research==
Viloxazine has undergone two randomized controlled trials for [[nocturnal enuresis]] (bedwetting) in children, both of those times versus imipramine.<ref name=Attenburrow_et_al_1984>{{cite journal |vauthors=Attenburrow AA, Stanley TV, Holland RP |title=Nocturnal enuresis: a study |journal=The Practitioner |volume=228 |issue=1387 |pages=99–102 |date=January 1984 |pmid=6364124}}</ref><ref name=Yurdakok_et_al_1987>{{note|Yurdakok_et_al_1987}} {{cite journal |vauthors=Yurdakök M, Kinik E, Güvenç H, Bedük Y |title=Viloxazine versus imipramine in the treatment of enuresis |journal= [[The Turkish Journal of Pediatrics]] |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=227–30 |year=1987 |pmid=3332732}}</ref> By 1990, it was seen as a less cardiotoxic alternative to imipramine, and to be especially effective in heavy sleepers.<ref name=Libert_1990>{{cite journal |author=Libert MH |trans_title=The use of viloxazine in the treatment of primary enuresis |language=French |journal=Acta Urologica Belgica |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=117–22 |year=1990 |pmid=2371930 |title=The use of viloxazine in the treatment of primary enuresis}}</ref>
