Efavirenz may cause convulsions in adult and pediatric populations who have a history of [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]].<ref name="USlabel2016" />

== Drug interactions ==
Efavirenz is broken down in the liver by [[enzyme]]s that belong to the [[Cytochrome P450|cytochrome P450 system]], which include both CYP2B6 and CYP3A4.<ref name="USlabel2016" /> Efavirenz is a substrate of these enzymes and can decrease the [[Drug metabolism|metabolism]] of other drugs that require the same enzymes.<ref name="USlabel2016" /> However, efavirenz also induces these enzymes, which means the enzyme activity is enhanced and the metabolism of other drugs broken down by CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 can be increased.<ref name="USlabel2016" /> People who are taking both efavirenz and other drugs metabolized by the same enzymes might need the dose of their drugs to be increased or decreased.

One group of drugs that efavirenz affects is protease inhibitors, which are used for HIV/AIDS. Efavirenz will lower the blood levels of most protease inhibitors, including aprenavir, atazanavir, and indinavir.<ref name="USlabel2016" /> At lowered levels, protease inhibitors may not be effective in people taking both drugs, which means the virus that causes HIV/AIDS won’t be stopped from replicating and may become resistant to the protease inhibitor.

Efavirenz also affects [[antifungal]] drugs, which are used for fungal infections such as urinary tract infections. Similar to the effect seen with protease inhibitors, efavirenz lowers the blood levels of antifungal drugs like voriconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and posaconazole.<ref name="USlabel2016" /> As a result of lowered levels, antifungal drugs may not be effective in people taking both drugs, which means that the fungi that cause the infection may become resistant to the antifungal.

== Mechanism of action ==

=== Anti-HIV effects ===
Efavirenz falls in the NNRTI class of antiretrovirals. Both nucleoside and non-nucleoside RTIs inhibit the same target, the [[reverse transcriptase]] enzyme, an essential viral enzyme which transcribes viral RNA into DNA. Unlike nucleoside RTIs, which bind at the enzyme's active site, NNRTIs act allosterically by binding to a distinct site away from the active site known as the NNRTI pocket.

Efavirenz is not effective against HIV-2, as the pocket of the HIV-2 reverse transcriptase has a different structure, which confers intrinsic resistance to the NNRTI class.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ren|first=J.|last2=Bird|first2=L. E.|last3=Chamberlain|first3=P. P.|last4=Stewart-Jones|first4=G. B.|last5=Stuart|first5=D. I.|last6=Stammers|first6=D. K.|date=2002-10-29|title=Structure of HIV-2 reverse transcriptase at 2.35-A resolution and the mechanism of resistance to non-nucleoside inhibitors|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=99|issue=22|pages=14410–14415|doi=10.1073/pnas.222366699|issn=0027-8424|pmc=137897|pmid=12386343}}</ref>

As most NNRTIs bind within the same pocket, viral strains which are resistant to efavirenz are usually also resistant to the other NNRTIs, [[nevirapine]] and [[delavirdine]]. The most common mutation observed after efavirenz treatment is K103N, which is also observed with other NNRTIs.<ref name=USlabel2016/> Nucleoside [[reverse-transcriptase inhibitor]]s (NRTIs) and efavirenz have different binding targets, so cross-resistance is unlikely; the same is true with regard to efavirenz and protease inhibitors.<ref name=AHFS2016/>

=== Neuropsychiatric effects ===
As of 2016 the mechanism of efavirenz' neuropsychiatric adverse effects was not clear.<ref name=Treisman2016/><ref name=Apostolova2015/>  Efavirenz appears to have [[neurotoxicity]], possibly by interfering with [[mitochondria]]l function, which may in turn possibly be caused by inhibiting [[creatine kinase]] but also possibly by disrupting mitochondrial [[cell membrane|membranes]] or by interfering with [[Biological functions of nitric oxide|nitric oxide signalling]].<ref name=Treisman2016/>  Some neuropsychiatric adverse effects may be mediated through [[cannabinoid receptors]], or through activity at the  [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor]], but efavirenz interacts with many CNS receptors, so this is not clear.<ref name=Treisman2016/>  The neuropsychiatric adverse effects are dose-dependent.<ref name=Treisman2016/>

== Chemical properties ==
Efavirenz is chemically described as (''S'')-6-chloro-(cyclopropylethynyl)-1,4-dihydro-4-(trifluoromethyl)-2''H''-3,1-benzoxazin-2-one. Its empirical formula is C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>9</sub>ClF<sub>3</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>. Efavirenz is a white to slightly pink crystalline powder with a molecular mass of 315.68 g/mol. It is practically [[insoluble]] in water (<10&nbsp;µg/mL).

== History ==
Efavirenz was approved by the FDA on September 21, 1998, making it the 14th approved antiretroviral drug.

On February 17, 2016, the FDA approved the generic tablet formulation to be produced by [[Mylan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.drugpatentwatch.com/p/tradename/EFAVIRENZ|title=Efavirenz Drug Profile|website=DrugPatentWatch|access-date=2016-11-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105743/https://www.drugpatentwatch.com/p/tradename/EFAVIRENZ|archivedate=2016-11-10|df=}}</ref>
