'''Escitalopram''', also known by the brand names '''Lexapro''' and '''Cipralex''' among others, is an [[antidepressant]] of the [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SSRI) class. It is approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for the treatment of adults and children over 12 years of age with [[major depressive disorder]] (MDD) or [[generalized anxiety disorder]] (GAD). Escitalopram is the (''S'')-[[stereoisomer]] (Left-[[enantiomer]]) of the earlier [[Lundbeck]] drug [[citalopram]], hence the name ''es''citalopram. Whether escitalopram exhibits superior therapeutic properties to citalopram or merely represents an example of "[[evergreening]]" is controversial.<ref name=Ind>[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/nhs-pays-millions-of-pounds-more-than-it-needs-to-for-drugs-2365615.html ''NHS pays millions of pounds more than it needs to for drugs''], ''The Independent''.

==Medical uses==
Escitalopram has FDA approval for the treatment of [[major depressive disorder]] in adolescents and adults, and [[generalized anxiety disorder]] in adults.<ref name=AHFS>{{cite web|title=Escitalopram Oxalate|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/escitalopram-oxalate.html|publisher=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref> In European countries and Australia, it is approved for depression (MDD) and certain anxiety disorders: [[general anxiety disorder]] (GAD), [[social anxiety disorder]] (SAD), [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD), and [[panic disorder]] with or without [[agoraphobia]].

===Depression===
Escitalopram was approved by regulatory authorities for the treatment of major depressive disorder on the basis of four placebo controlled, [[double-blind]] trials, three of which demonstrated a statistical superiority over placebo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2002/21-323.pdf_Lexapro_Medr_P1.pdf |title=www.accessdata.fda.gov |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Controversy exists regarding the effectiveness of escitalopram compared to its predecessor citalopram. The importance of this issue follows from the greater cost of escitalopram relative to the generic mixture of isomers citalopram prior to the expiration of the escitalopram patent in 2012, which led to charges of [[evergreening]]. Accordingly, this issue has been examined in at least 10 different systematic reviews and meta analyses. The most recent of these have concluded (with caveats in some cases) that escitalopram is modestly superior to citalopram in efficacy and tolerability.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ramsberg J, Asseburg C, Henriksson M | title = Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of antidepressants in primary care: a multiple treatment comparison meta-analysis and cost-effectiveness model | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 8 | pages = e42003 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22876296 | pmc = 3410906 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0042003 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cipriani A, Purgato M, Furukawa TA, Trespidi C, Imperadore G, Signoretti A, Churchill R, Watanabe N, Barbui C | title = Citalopram versus other anti-depressive agents for depression | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = 7 | issue =  | pages = CD006534 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22786497 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006534.pub2 | pmc=4204633}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Favré P | title = [Clinical efficacy and achievement of a complete remission in depression: increasing interest in treatment with escitalopram] | language = French | journal = Encephale | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 86–96 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22381728 | doi = 10.1016/j.encep.2011.11.003 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sicras-Mainar A, Navarro-Artieda R, Blanca-Tamayo M, Gimeno-de la Fuente V, Salvatella-Pasant J | title = Comparison of escitalopram vs. citalopram and venlafaxine in the treatment of major depression in Spain: clinical and economic consequences | journal = Curr Med Res Opin | volume = 26 | issue = 12 | pages = 2757–64 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21034375 | doi = 10.1185/03007995.2010.529430 }}</ref>

===Overdose===
Excessive doses of escitalopram usually cause relatively minor untoward effects such as agitation and [[tachycardia]]. However, [[dyskinesia]], [[hypertonia]], and [[clonus]] may occur in some cases. Plasma escitalopram concentrations are usually in a range of 20–80 μg/L in therapeutic situations and may reach 80–200 μg/L in the elderly, patients with hepatic dysfunction, those who are poor CYP2C19 metabolizers or following acute overdose. Monitoring of the drug in plasma or serum is generally accomplished using chromatographic methods.

Escitalopram increases intrasynaptic levels of the neurotransmitter [[serotonin]] by blocking the [[reuptake]] of the neurotransmitter into the presynaptic neuron. Of the SSRIs currently on the market, escitalopram has the highest selectivity for the [[serotonin transporter]] (SERT) compared to the [[norepinephrine transporter]] (NET), making the side-effect profile relatively mild in comparison to less-selective SSRIs.<ref name = "GG">Brunton L, Chabner B, Knollman B. Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Twelfth Edition. McGraw Hill Professional; 2010.</ref> The opposite [[enantiomer]], (''R'')-citalopram, counteracts to a certain degree the serotonin-enhancing action of escitalopram. {{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} As a result, escitalopram has been claimed to be a more potent antidepressant than the [[racemic mixture]], citalopram, of the two enantiomers.
In order to explain this phenomenon, researchers from Lundbeck proposed that escitalopram enhances its own binding via an additional interaction with another [[allosteric site]] on the transporter.<ref name="pmid15160261">For an overview of supporting data, see {{cite journal |vauthors=Sánchez C, Bøgesø KP, Ebert B, Reines EH, Braestrup C | title = Escitalopram versus citalopram: the surprising role of the R-enantiomer | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 174 | issue = 2 | pages = 163–76 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15160261 | doi = 10.1007/s00213-004-1865-z }}</ref>
Further research by the same group showed that (''R'')-citalopram also enhances binding of escitalopram,<ref name="pmid15695064">{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen F, Larsen MB, Sánchez C, Wiborg O | title = The (''S'')-enantiomer of (''R'',''S'')-citalopram, increases inhibitor binding to the human serotonin transporter by an allosteric mechanism.

In the most recent paper, however, the same authors again reversed their findings and reported that (''R'')-citalopram decreases binding of escitalopram to the transporter.<ref name="pmid16448580">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mansari ME, Wiborg O, Mnie-Filali O, Benturquia N, Sánchez C, Haddjeri N | title = Allosteric modulation of the effect of escitalopram, paroxetine and fluoxetine: in-vitro and in-vivo studies | journal = The International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 31–40 | year = 2007 | pmid = 16448580 | doi = 10.1017/S1461145705006462 }}</ref> Although allosteric binding of escitalopram to the serotonin transporter is of unquestionable research interest, its clinical relevance is unclear since the binding of escitalopram to the allosteric site is at least 1000 times weaker than to the primary binding site.

Escitalopram is a substrate of [[P-glycoprotein]] and hence P-glycoprotein inhibitors such as [[verapamil]] and [[quinidine]] may improve its blood-brain penetrability.<ref name = ESC/> In a preclinical study in rats combining escitalopram with a P-glycoprotein inhibitor enhanced its antidepressant-like effects.<ref name = ESC>{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Brien FE, O'Connor RM, Clarke G, Dinan TG, Griffin BT, Cryan JF | title = P-glycoprotein inhibition increases the brain distribution and antidepressant-like activity of escitalopram in rodents | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 38 | issue = 11 | pages = 2209–2219 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 23670590 | doi = 10.1038/npp.2013.120 | pmc=3773671}}</ref>

===Interactions===

Escitalopram, similarly to other SSRIs (with the exception of [[fluvoxamine]]), inhibits [[CYP2D6]] and hence may increase plasma levels of a number of CYP2D6 substrates such as [[aripiprazole]], [[risperidone]], [[tramadol]], [[codeine]], etc. As much of the effect of codeine is attributable to its conversion (10%) to morphine its effectiveness will be reduced by this inhibition, not enhanced.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ali Torkamani|title=Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and CYP2D6|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1879354-overview|work=Medscape.com|date=|accessdate=14 May 2015}}</ref> As escitalopram is only a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6, analgesia from tramadol may not be affected.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Noehr-Jensen|first1=L|last2=Zwisler|first2=ST|last3=Larsen|first3=F|last4=Sindrup|first4=SH|last5=Damkier|first5=P|last6=Brosen|first6=K|title=Escitalopram is a weak inhibitor of the CYP2D6-catalyzed O-demethylation of (+)-tramadol but does not reduce the hypoalgesic effect in experimental pain.|journal=Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics|date=December 2009|volume=86|issue=6|pages=626–33|pmid=19710642|doi=10.1038/clpt.2009.154}}</ref> Escitalopram can also prolong the QT interval and hence it is not recommended in patients that are concurrently on other medications that have the ability to prolong the QT interval. Being a SSRI, escitalopram should not be given concurrently with [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAOIs]] or other serotonergic medications.<ref name="GG"/>

==History==
[[Image:Cipralex.jpg|thumb|right|Cipralex brand escitalopram 10mg package and tablet sheet]]

Escitalopram was developed in close cooperation between [[Lundbeck]] and [[Forest Laboratories]]. Its development was initiated in the summer of 1997, and the resulting new drug application was submitted to the U.S. FDA in March 2001. The short time (3.5 years) it took to develop escitalopram can be attributed to the previous extensive experience of Lundbeck and Forest with citalopram, which has similar pharmacology.<ref>{{cite web | title=2000 Annual Report. p 28 and 33 | url=http://www.materials.lundbeck.com/lundbeck/82/fullpdf/1.pdf |format=PDF |year=2000 |publisher=Lundbeck | accessdate=2007-04-07}}</ref>
The FDA issued the approval of escitalopram for major depression in August 2002 and for generalized anxiety disorder in December 2003. On May 23, 2006, the FDA approved a generic version of escitalopram by Teva.<ref>{{cite news |author=Miranda Hitti |title=FDA OKs Generic Depression Drug – Generic Version of Lexapro Gets Green Light |url=http://www.webmd.com/content/article/122/114778.htm |publisher=WebMD |accessdate=2007-10-10}}</ref> On July 14 of that year, however, the [[United States District Court for the District of Delaware|U.S. District Court of Delaware]] decided in favor of Lundbeck regarding the patent infringement dispute and ruled the patent on escitalopram valid.<ref>{{cite news |author=Marie-Eve Laforte |title= US court upholds Lexapro patent |date=2006-07-14 |url=http://www.firstwordplus.com/Fws.do?src=corp_site&articleid=7474B41ED0D14C20894E262219E24B62 |publisher=FirstWord |accessdate=2007-10-10}}</ref>

In 2006 Forest Laboratories was granted an 828-day (2 years and 3 months) extension on its [[united States of America|US]] patent for escitalopram.<ref>{{cite press release| title = Forest Laboratories Receives Patent Term Extension for Lexapro| publisher = PRNewswire-FirstCall| date = 2006-03-02| url =  http://www.frx.com/news/PressRelease.aspx?ID=824655| accessdate = 2009-01-19}}</ref> This pushed the patent expiration date from December 7, 2009 to September 14, 2011. Together with the 6-month pediatric exclusivity, the final expiration date was March 14, 2012.

===Allegations of illegal marketing===

In 2004, two separate civil suits alleging illegal marketing of citalopram and escitalopram for use by children and teenagers by Forest were initiated by two whistleblowers, one by a practicing physician named Joseph Piacentile, and the other by a Forest salesman named Christopher Gobble.<ref>[http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202428657301 "Forest Laboratories: A Tale of Two Whistleblowers"] article by Alison Frankel in ''[[The American Lawyer]] February 27, 2009</ref> In February 2009, these two suits received support from the US Attorney for Massachusetts and were combined into one. Eleven states and the District of Columbia have also filed notices of intention to intervene as plaintiffs in the action. The suits allege that Forest illegally engaged in off-label promoting of Lexapro for use in children, that the company hid the results of a study showing lack of effectiveness in children, and that the company paid [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]] to doctors to induce them to prescribe Lexapro to children.  It was also alleged that the company conducted so-called "seeding studies" that were, in reality, marketing efforts to promote the drug's use by doctors.<ref>[http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/forestfca.pdf United States of America v. Forest Laboratories] Full text of the federal complaint filed in the US District Court for the district of Massachusetts</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/26/business/26drug.html "Drug Maker Is Accused of Fraud"] article by Barry Meier and Benedict Carey in ''[[The New York Times]] February 25, 2009</ref> Forest responded to these allegations that it "is committed to adhering to the highest ethical and legal standards, and off-label promotion and improper payments to medical providers have consistently been against Forest policy."<ref>[http://www.frx.com/news/PressRelease.aspx?ID=1260234 "Forest Laboratories, Inc. Provides Statement in Response to Complaint Filed by U.S. Government"] Forest press-release. February 26, 2009.</ref>
In 2010 Forest Pharmaceuticals Inc., agreed to pay more than $313 million to settle the charges over Lexapro and two other drugs, Levothroid and Celexa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/drug-maker-forest-pleads-guilty-pay-more-313-million-resolve-criminal-charges-and-false|title=Drug Maker Forest Pleads Guilty; To Pay More Than $313 Million to Resolve Criminal Charges and False Claims Act Allegations|website=www.justice.gov}}</ref>

===Brand names===
Escitalopram is sold under many brand names worldwide such as Cipralex.<ref name=drugsINT>drugs.com [http://www.drugs.com/international/escitalopram.html Drugs.com international: Escitalopram] Page accessed April 25, 2015</ref>
