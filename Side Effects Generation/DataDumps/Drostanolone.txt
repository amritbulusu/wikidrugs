Drostanolone binds to the [[androgen receptor]] and activates a cascade of genetic changes, which increases the [[protein synthesis]] ([[anabolism]]) and decreases the [[amino acid]]s degradation ([[catabolism]]). Other effects of drostanolone are reduction or inhibition of [[Prolactin inhibiting factor|prolactin]] or [[estrogen receptor]]s, which are linked to its [[antitumor]] properties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/pims/pharm/pim901.htm|title=Drostanolone (PIM 901)|website=www.inchem.org|access-date=2016-03-15}}</ref>

==Medical uses==

===Breast cancer===
[[Hormonal treatment]] is part of the complex therapy for some kind of [[tumors]], particularly the ones associated with hormone-active tissues like breast or [[prostate cancer]]. Some types of [[breast cancer]] cells, expressing [[estrogen receptor]]s (called ER+ cancers), use [[estrogen]] for their growth and dissemination. That is why drugs that block estrogen receptors or decrease their expression on the cell membrane- anti-estrogens- could limit the tumor spread and size. Drostanolone has been FDA approved<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/docs/obdetail.cfm?Appl_No=012936&TABLE1=OB_DISC|title=Orange Book: Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations|website=www.accessdata.fda.gov|access-date=2016-03-15}}</ref> as an [[anti-estrogenic]] drug for the treatment of breast cancer. By the time of its release, there were not many alternatives for patients suffering from breast cancer and drostanolone was a revolution for these patients. As it has lower [[androgenic]] rate compared to [[testosterone]], the risk of [[virilization]] is much lighter. Due to this fact, women, who usually do not respond well to any [[anabolic steroid]]s, were having much greater chance to survive cancer. Drostanolone can also be used for breast tumors that do not respond well to other treatments or also as [[palliative care]] for advanced incurable tumors. The effects of the product depend of course on the dose and period of administration. The risk of virilization becomes greater with high doses and continuous administration period.

==Non-medical uses==

===Bodybuilding===
With the development of more precise treatment approaches, drostanolone as an antitumor agent is being replaced by medicaments with lower virilization risk and reduced side effects. However, drostanolone remains popular amongst [[Bodybuilding|bodybuilders]],{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} especially during cutting cycles, when fat loss is the main target. It should be emphasized that drostanolone will be only effective if the user's body fat percentage is already low (<10%){{citation needed|date=February 2017}}. If this is the case, drostanolone will not only help with the last stubborn bit of fat, but will also improve the physique, making it appear harder and leaner by underlining muscle separation. This makes drostanolone popular for pre-contest cycles. These effects of drostanolone are due to its inability to aromatize into [[estrogen]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/ftc/agent/DB00858|title=DB00858 - 'Drostanolone'|website=www.ebi.ac.uk|access-date=2016-03-15}}</ref>

Many bodybuilders combine drostanolone with other AAS.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Drostanolone itself is only weakly anabolic, which is why it is not used alone during bulking cycles.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} However, when combined with other anabolic steroids, drostanolone may enhance their effects. Also, drostanolone binds [[sex hormone-binding globulin]] (SHBG) which usually will bind a portion of free sex hormones and steroids, like [[testosterone (hormone)|testosterone,]] and inactivate them. When drostanolone binds to SHBG, the level of unbound SHBG drops, lowering the chance of it binding to other steroids, which increases their bioavailablilty.

In addition, drostanolone is also suitable for those following [[calorie]]s restricted regime as it increases strength, reduces recovery periods and improves endurance without weight gain.

==Side effects==
{{See also|Anabolic steroid#Adverse effects}}

As drostanolone does not aromatize at any dose, typical [[estrogen]]-linked side effects encountered when using other [[anabolic steroid]]s, like water retention, gynecomastia, and elevated blood pressure are not observed.

However, [[androgenic]] effects such as accelerated [[Hair loss|alopecia]] and [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] can appear. In women, drostanolone can cause [[virilization]] when used in high doses. Drostanolone can also cause a decrease in [[Hdl cholesterol|HDL cholesterol]] and an increase in [[Ldl cholesterol|LDL cholesterol]]. As drostanolone also suppresses natural [[testosterone]] production, additional testosterone therapy and post-cycle therapy should be considered.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/pims/pharm/pim901.htm#SectionTitle:7.7%2520%2520Main%2520adverse%2520effects|title=Drostanolone (PIM 901)|website=www.inchem.org|access-date=2016-03-15}}</ref>

==Chemistry==
{{See also|List of androgens/anabolic steroids}}

Drostanolone, also known as '''2α-methyl-5α-dihydrotestosterone''' ('''2α-methyl-DHT''') or as '''2α-methyl-5α-androstan-17β-ol-3-one''', is a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]] [[androstane]] [[steroid]] and a [[chemical derivative|derivative]] of DHT. It is specifically DHT with a [[methyl group]] at the C2α position.
