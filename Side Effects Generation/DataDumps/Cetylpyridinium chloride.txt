'''Cetylpyridinium chloride''' ('''CPC''') is a [[cationic]] [[quaternary ammonium]] compound used in some types of [[mouthwash]]es, [[toothpaste]]s, [[Throat lozenge|lozenge]]s, throat sprays, breath sprays, and [[nasal spray]]s. It is an [[antiseptic]] that kills bacteria and other microorganisms. It has been shown to be effective in preventing dental [[Dental plaque|plaque]] and reducing [[gingivitis]].<ref>{{cite journal| journal=Journal of Dental Hygiene | title=Cetylpyridinium chloride mouth rinse on gingivitis and plaque | first=Joanna | last=Asadoorian | last2=Williams | first2=Karen | volume=82 | issue=5 | year=2008}}</ref><ref name="haps">{{Cite journal | last1 = Haps | first1 = S. | last2 = Slot | first2 = D.

==Synonyms==
Cetylpyridinium chloride is present in commercial products such as 1-palmitylpyridinium chloride, C16-alkylpyridinium chloride, 1-hexadecylpyridinium chloride, acetoquat CPC, aktivex, ammonyx CPC, cecure, ceepryn chloride, cepacol, ceprim, cepacol chloride, cetafilm, cetamium, dobendan, halset, ipanol, medilave, mercocet, merothol, pionin B, pristacin, pyrisept, and asept.

==Chemistry==
Cetylpyridinium chloride has the molecular formula C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>38</sub>NCl and at its pure form is in a solid state at [[room temperature]]. It has a melting point of 77&nbsp;°C when [[anhydrous]] or 80–83&nbsp;°C in its [[monohydrate]] form. It is soluble in water but insoluble in [[acetone]], [[acetic acid]], or [[ethanol]]. It has a [[pyridine]]-like odor. It is combustible. Concentrated solutions are destructive to [[mucous membrane]]s.   Its [[critical micelle concentration]] (CMC) is 0.00012[[molar concentration|M]],<ref>http://www.applichem.com/en/shop/product-detail/as/cetylpyridiniumchlorid-monohydrat-ibiochemicai/?getspecpdf=1</ref> and is strongly dependent on the salt concentration of the solution.

In some products, the [[bromide]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]], cetylpyridinium bromide, is used instead. Its properties are virtually identical.

==Toxicology and pharmacology==
With intravenous infusion as the delivery mechanism, the {{LD50}} of    
cetylpyridinium chloride has been measured at 30&nbsp;mg/kg in rats and 36&nbsp;mg/kg in rabbits.  Conversely, with [[oral administration]] LD<sub>50</sub> levels are higher, having been measured at 200&nbsp;mg/kg in [[Laboratory rat|rats]], 400&nbsp;mg/kg in [[Domestic rabbit#Laboratory rabbits|rabbits]], and 108&nbsp;mg/kg in [[Laboratory mice#Laboratory mice|mice]].<ref>{{cite book | author = Lewis, R.J | title = Sax's Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials | edition = 9th | volume = 1-3 | location = New York, NY | publisher = Van Nostrand Reinhold | year = 1996 | page = 691}}</ref>

==Use in over-the-counter drugs ==

{{globalize|section|date=April 2013}}

OTC products containing cetylpyridinium chloride include oral wash, oral rinse, as well as ingestable products (e.g. CPC lozenges).<ref>[http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/search.cfm?startswith=CETYLPYRIDINIUM+CHLORIDE&x=20&y=6 at least 125 OTC oral healthcare products containing CPC (as of September 2012)]</ref> In addition, cough syrups containing CPC are also available as OTC medications.<ref>For example,  [http://www.conceptpharmacy.co.uk/kilkof-cough-mixture-150ml Kilcof Cough Mixture]</ref>

The FDA monograph on oral antiseptic drug products reviewed the data regarding CPC and concluded the following: ''"The agency believes that the information contained in its adverse reaction files, 30 years of safe marketing of an OTC mouthwash containing cetylpyridinium chloride (NDA 14- 598), and the safety data evaluated by the Oral Cavity Panel are sufficient to conclude that 0.025 to 0.1 percent cetylpyridinium chloride is safe as an OTC oral antiseptic when labeled for short-term use (not to exceed 7 days)."''<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/Over-the-CounterOTCDrugs/StatusofOTCRulemakings/ucm096101.pdf FDA monograph on oral antiseptic drug products],  page 6094</ref>

In addition, the National Library of Medicine Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET) reviewed the range of toxicity of CPC, and stated that, "Significant toxicity is rare after exposure to low concentration products that are typically available in the home."<ref name=toxnet>[http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+38 National Library of Medicine Toxicology Data Network]</ref>

The fatal dose in humans ingesting cationic detergents has been estimated to be 1 to 3 g.<ref name=toxnet/> Therefore, a person using a typical oral ingestible product that provides 0.25&nbsp;mg CPC per dose will need to take 4000 doses at one time before they would be in the estimated fatal dose range.

A review of clinical studies on cetylpyridinium chloride found that mouthwashes containing CPC "provide a small but significant additional benefit when compared with toothbrushing only or toothbrushing followed by a placebo rinse" in reducing plaque and gingivitis-inﬂammation.<ref name="haps"/> In combination with [[chlorhexidine]] and zinc lactate, CPC has been found to be effective in treating [[halitosis]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Winkel | first1 = E.

Cetylpyridinium chloride can only be used as a inactive ingredient in OTC products, but can be an active ingredient in prescription products.{{cn|date=October 2017}}<!-- in what jurisdiction? -->
