==Medical uses==
Noretynodrel was formerly used in combination with the [[estrogen]] [[mestranol]] in the treatment of [[gynecological disorder|gynecological]] and [[menstrual disorder]]s and as a [[combined oral contraceptive]].<ref name="Marks2010" /><ref name="Hollinger2007" /> It has since been discontinued.<ref name="WilliamsFoye2002" /><ref name="IndexNominum2000" /><ref name="Drugs.com" />

Noretynodrel is very closely related to norethisterone and tibolone, which are the Δ<sup>4</sup>-isomer and the 7α-[[methyl group|methyl]] derivative of noretynodrel, respectively.<ref name="pmid22210085">{{cite journal |vauthors=Jin Y, Duan L, Chen M, Penning TM, Kloosterboer HJ |title=Metabolism of the synthetic progestogen norethynodrel by human ketosteroid reductases of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily |journal=J.

Relative to other 19-nortestosterone progestins, noretynodrel is said to possess much stronger estrogenic activity.<ref name="pmid2256526" />

==Chemistry==
Noretynodrel is an [[estrane]] (C18) [[steroid]] and is also known chemically as '''17α-ethynyl-δ<sup>5(10)</sup>-19-nortestosterone''' or as '''17α-ethynylestr-5(10)-en-17β-ol-3-one''', as well as '''17α-ethynyl-19-nor-5(10)-testosterone''' or '''5(10)-norethisterone'''.<ref name="Elks2014" /><ref name="IndexNominum2000" /> It is a derivative of [[testosterone]] that has been [[ethynyl group|ethynyl]]ated at the C17α position, [[desmethyl|demethyl]]ated at the C19 position, and [[dehydrogenation|dehydrogenated]] (i.e., has a [[double bond]]) between the C5 and C10 positions. As such, noretynodrel is also a combined derivative of [[nandrolone]] (19-nortestosterone) and [[ethisterone]] (17α-ethynyltestosterone). In addition, it is an [[isomer]] of norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) in which the C4 double bond has been replaced with a double bond between the C5 and C10 positions. For this reason, noretynodrel is also known as '''5(10)-norethisterone'''. Few other 19-nortestosterone progestins share the C5(10) double bond of noretynodrel, but an example of one that does is [[tibolone]], the 7α-[[methyl group|methyl]] derivative of noretynodrel (i.e., 7α-methylnoretynodrel).

==History==
Noretynodrel was first synthesized by [[Frank B. Colton]] of [[G.D. Searle, LLC|G. D. Searle & Company]] in 1952, and this was preceded by the synthesis of norethisterone by [[Luis E. Miramontes]] and [[Carl Djerassi]] of [[Syntex]] in 1951.<ref name="Marks2010" /> In 1957, both noretynodrel and norethisterone were approved in the [[United States]] for the treatment of [[menstrual disorder]]s.<ref name="Ravina2011">{{cite book |author= Enrique Ravina |title= The Evolution of Drug Discovery: From Traditional Medicines to Modern Drugs |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=iDNy0XxGqT8C&pg=PA190 |date= 11 January 2011 |publisher= John Wiley & Sons |isbn= 978-3-527-32669-3 |pages= 190–}}</ref> In 1960, noretynodrel, in combination with [[mestranol]] (as '''Enovid'''), was introduced in the United States as the first oral contraceptive, and the combination of norethisterone and mestranol followed in 1963 as the second oral contraceptive to be introduced.<ref name="Ravina2011" /> In 1988, Enovid, along with other oral contraceptives containing high doses of estrogen, was discontinued.<ref>{{cite news |author= Reuters News Service |title=Searle, 2 others to stop making high-estrogen pill |work= St. Louis Post-Dispatch |pages=7D |date= 1988-04-15 |url= http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_text_direct-0=0EB327685B9D39FF&p_field_direct-0=document_id |accessdate=2009-08-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=High-estrogen 'pill' going off market |work= San Jose Mercury News |date= 1988-04-15 |url= http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_text_direct-0=0EB72D898C02F468&p_field_direct-0=document_id |accessdate= 2009-08-29}}</ref>
