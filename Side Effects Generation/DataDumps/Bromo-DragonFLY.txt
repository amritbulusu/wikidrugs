'''Bromo-DragonFLY''' (or '''3C-Bromo-Dragonfly''', '''DOB-Dragonfly'''<ref>https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/bromo_dragonfly/bromo_dragonfly.shtml</ref>)  is a [[psychedelic drug]] related to the [[phenethylamine]] family. Bromo-DragonFLY is considered an extremely potent hallucinogen, around one third as potent as [[LSD]] with a normal dose in the region of 200 [[μg]] to 800 μg,{{citation needed|reason=The "normal dose" of LSD amount doesn't have citation.|date=January 2016}} and it has an extremely long duration of action, up to several days.<ref name="titleErowid Bromo-Dragonfly Vault : Dosage">{{cite web |url=http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/bromo_dragonfly/bromo_dragonfly_dose.shtml |title=Erowid Bromo-DragonFly Vault : Dosage |accessdate= |work=}}</ref>  Bromo-DragonFLY has a [[stereocenter]] and (''R'')-(−)-bromo-DragonFLY is the more active [[stereoisomer]].

==History==
Bromo-DragonFLY was first synthesized by Matthew Parker in the laboratory of [[David E. Nichols]] in 1998. As with the earlier and less potent [[dihydrofuran]] series of compounds nicknamed ''FLY'', Bromo-DragonFLY was named after its superficial structural resemblance to a dragonfly.

==Pharmacology==
The hallucinogenic effect of bromo-DragonFLY is mediated by its [[agonist]] activity<!-- 93% of 5-HT --> at the [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]] [[5-HT receptor|serotonin receptor]]. Bromo-DragonFLY also has a high [[binding (molecular)|binding]] [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for the 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> and  5-HT<sub>2C</sub> [[serotonin]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]], and is most accurately described as a non-subtype selective 5-HT<sub>2</sub> agonist, as it is actually twice as potent an agonist for 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors as for 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, as well as being less than 5x selective for 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> over 5-HT<sub>2B</sub>.<ref name="pmid9857084">{{cite journal |vauthors=Parker MA, Marona-Lewicka D, Lucaites VL, Nelson DL, Nichols DE |title=A novel (benzodifuranyl)aminoalkane with extremely potent activity at the 5-HT2A receptor |journal=Journal of Medicinal Chemistry |volume=41 |issue=26 |pages=5148–9 |date=December 1998 |pmid=9857084 |doi=10.1021/jm9803525 |url=}}</ref><ref>Corazza O, Schifano F, Farre M, Deluca P, Davey Z, Torrens M, Demetrovics Z, Di Furia L, Flesland L, Siemann H, Skutle A, Van Der Kreeft P, Scherbaum N. Designer drugs on the internet: a phenomenon out-of-control? the emergence of hallucinogenic drug Bromo-Dragonfly. ''Current Clinical Pharmacology''. 2011 May;6(2):125-9. {{PMID|21592070}}</ref>

==Dosage==
The typical dose of Bromo-DragonFLY is not known, however it has varied from 500 μg to 1&nbsp;mg.<ref name="titleErowid Bromo-Dragonfly Vault : Dosage"/> It has about 300 times the potency of mescaline, or 1/5 the potency of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]]. It has been sold in the form of [[Blotting paper|blotters]], similar to the distribution method of LSD, which has led to confusion, and reports of mistakenly consuming Bromo-DragonFly. It has a much longer duration of action than LSD and can last for up to 2–3 days<ref name="titleErowid Bromo-Dragonfly Vault : Dosage"/> following a single large dose, with a slow onset of action that can take up to 6 hours before the effects are felt.

==Toxicity==
[[File:Packet of 4BDF powder.jpg|thumb|right|4BDF powder. The pink color is most likely due to an impurity. The color of pure BDF is usually white to off-white, similar to most recreational drugs, so there is no way to distinguish between them by eye.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}]]
The toxicity of Bromo-DragonFLY appears to be fairly high for humans when taken in doses significantly above the [[therapeutic range]], with reports of at least five deaths believed to have resulted from Bromo-DragonFLY reported in [[Norway]],<ref name="titleErowid Bromo-Dragonfly Vault : Reported GHB-Related Death Involved Bromo-Dragonfly">{{cite web |url=http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/bromo_dragonfly/bromo_dragonfly_death2.shtml |title=Erowid Bromo-Dragonfly Vault : Reported GHB-Related Death Involved Bromo-Dragonfly |accessdate= |work=}}</ref> [[Sweden]],<ref name="titleErowid Bromo-Dragonfly Vault : Information about a death reportedly related to Bromo-Dragonfly">{{cite web |url=http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/bromo_dragonfly/bromo_dragonfly_death1.shtml |title=Erowid Bromo-Dragonfly Vault : Information about a death reportedly related to Bromo-Dragonfly |accessdate= |work=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news

Laboratory testing has confirmed that in October 2009, a batch of Bromo-Dragonfly was distributed, mislabeled as the related compound [[2C-B-FLY]], which is around 20x less potent than BDF by weight. This mistake is believed to have contributed to several lethal overdoses and additional hospitalizations. The batch implicated in these deaths also contained significant synthesis impurities, which may have contributed to the toxicity.<ref name="Erowid 2C-B-Fly Vault: Death Report">{{cite web |url=http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/2cb_fly/2cb_fly_death1.shtml |title=Erowid 2C-B-Fly Vault: Death Report |accessdate= |work=}}</ref>

[[vasoconstriction|Vasoconstrictive]] action resulting from severe overdose of Bromo-DragonFLY is known to have caused tissue [[necrosis]] of the extremities in at least one case.  In September 2007, a 35-year-old Swedish male required amputation of the front part of his feet and several fingers on one hand after taking a massive (but unknown) overdose; reportedly, the compound acted as a long-acting efficacious vasoconstrictor, leading to necrosis and [[gangrene]] which became apparent several weeks after the overdose occurred.  Treatment was of limited efficacy in this case, although [[tolazoline]] is reportedly an effective treatment where available.<ref>[http://www.lakartidningen.se/engine.php?articleId=9254 Bromo-dragonfly – livsfarlig missbruksdrog] (Swedish)</ref><ref>Thorlacius K, Borna C, Personne M.

Overdose-associated [[bad trip|disturbing experiences]] and health problems have been described.

On October 3, 2009, a 22-year-old male from Copenhagen died after ingesting Bromo-dragonfly. His friend described the trip saying, "It was like being dragged to hell and back again. Many times. It is the most evil [thing] I've ever tried. It lasted an eternity." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://jp.dk/indland/kbh/article1884968.ece |title=&#124; Danish man died after trip on Chinese drug |publisher=Jp.dk |date= |accessdate=2010-02-08}}</ref>

On May 7, 2011, in the United States, two young adults died after overdosing on Bromo-DragonFLY, which they thought was [[2C-E]], and several others were hospitalized during the same incident. Because they took a dosage appropriate for 2C-E, those who took the drug received, in some cases, 100x the normal dose. Both deaths followed seizures, vomiting blood, and terrifying hallucinations. Several surviving victims are reportedly still suffering from its physical effects.<ref name="Two dead, seven injured after designer drug overdose">[http://www.newson6.com/story/14641463/second-victim-dies-after-taking-designer-drug-in-konawa]</ref>
