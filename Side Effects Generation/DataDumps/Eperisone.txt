'''Eperisone''' (formulated as the '''eperisone hydrochloride''' salt) is an [[antispasmodic]] drug.

Eperisone acts by relaxing both [[skeletal muscle]]s and [[vascular smooth muscle]]s, and demonstrates a variety of effects such as reduction of [[myotonia]], improvement of [[Circulatory system|circulation]], and suppression of the pain reflex. The drug inhibits the vicious circle of myotonia by decreasing pain, [[ischaemia]], and [[hypertonia]] in skeletal muscles, thus alleviating stiffness and [[spasticity]], and facilitating muscle movement<ref name=Yang>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yang SI, Park HY, Lee SH |title=Transdermal eperisone elicits more potent and longer-lasting muscle relaxation than oral eperisone |journal=Pharmacology |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=150–6 |date=July 2004 |pmid=15161997 |doi=10.1159/000077449 |url=|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

Eperisone also improves [[dizziness]] and [[tinnitus]] associated with [[cerebrovascular]] disorders or [[cervical spondylosis]].

Eperisone has a relatively low incidence of [[sedation]] when compared with other antispasmodic drugs; this simplifies the [[Illness|clinical]] application of the drug and makes it an attractive choice for patients who require antispasmodic therapy without a reduction in [[alertness]].
[[File:ミオナール50m錠P6075387.jpg|right|thumb|Japanese package of eperisone]]
Eperisone also facilitates voluntary movement of the upper and lower [[Limb (anatomy)|extremities]] without reducing muscle power; it is therefore useful during the initial stage of [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] and as a supporting drug during subsequent rehabilitative [[Physical therapy|therapy]].

==Presentation==
Eperisone hydrochloride is available as the brand name preparation Myonal as 50&nbsp;mg [[sugar coated]] [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]], or as 10% granules for oral administration.<ref name=di>{{cite web |url=http://di.eisai.co.jp/di/EPI/MYO_T-G_EPI.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229124214/http://di.eisai.co.jp/di/EPI/MYO_T-G_EPI.pdf |archivedate=2009-12-29 |df= }}</ref> An experimental form of the drug, as a transdermal patch system, has shown promising results in laboratory tests on rodents; however, this product is not currently available for human use.<ref name=transdermal>{{cite journal | author = Yang Sang-In |author2=Park Ha-Young |author3=Lee Sang-Ho |author4=Lee Seung-Jin |author5=Han Ok-Yeun |author6=Lim Sung-Cil |author7=Jang Choon-Gon |author8=Lee Wan-Suk |author9=Shin Young-Hee |author10=Kim Jung-Ju |author11=Lee Seok-Yong |date=July 2004 | title = Transdermal eperisone elicits more potent and longer-lasting muscle relaxation than oral eperisone | journal = Pharmacology | volume = 71 | issue = 3 | pages = 150–6 | doi = 10.1159/000077449 | pmid = 15161997}}</ref> It is also available as the brand name Epry as 50&nbsp;mg as sugar coated tablets.

==Dosage and administration==
In adults, the usual dose of eperisone is 50–150&nbsp;mg per day, in divided doses, after meals. However, the dosage is adjusted by the [[Medical prescription|prescribing]] [[clinician]] depending on factors such as severity of [[symptoms]], patient age and response.

Eperisone has not been established as definitely safe for [[paediatric]] use, therefore its use in paediatrics cannot be recommended without further study.<ref name=di/>

If [[elderly]] patients are treated with eperisone, a reduced dose is recommended, and the patient should be  closely monitored for signs of psychological hypofunction during treatment.<ref name=di/>

==Safety during pregnancy and breast-feeding==
Eperisone has not been established to be safe for use by [[pregnant]] women; therefore the drug should only be used in pregnant women, or women who may be pregnant, if the expected [[Drug therapy|therapeutic]] benefits will outweigh the possible risks associated with treatment. The manufacturers of Myonal recommend the drug not be used during [[lactation]] ([[breast-feeding]]). If eperisone must be used, the patient is advised to stop breast-feeding for the duration of treatment. Eperisone has beed reported to be excreted in breast milk in an animal study (in rats).

==Pharmacology==
* [[Skeletal muscle]] [[Relaxation technique|relaxation]]
* Relaxation of [[Hypertonia|hypertonic]] skeletal muscles
* Improves [[intramuscular]] [[blood flow]]
* Suppression of [[spinal reflex]] potentials
* Reduction of [[muscle spindle]] sensitivity via [[motor neurons]]
* [[vasodilator|Vasodilatation]] and augmentation of blood flow
* [[Analgesic]] action and inhibition of the pain reflex in the [[spinal cord]]

==Contraindications==
Eperisone is [[contraindicated]] in patients with known [[hypersensitivity]] to the drug.<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00327730|Evaluation of Eperisone HCl in the Treatment of Acute Musculoskeletal Spasm Associated With Low Back Pain}}</ref>
Side effects: 'very rare' excessive relaxation, stomachache, nausea, vertigo, anorexia, drowsiness, skin rashes, diarrhoea, vomiting, indigestion, GI disturbances, insomnia, headache, constipation etc.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.squarepharma.com.bd/SPL_PI_PDF/myonil226.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128151901/http://squarepharma.com.bd/SPL_PI_PDF/myonil226.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-28 |df= }}</ref>

==Cautions==
Eperisone should be administered with care in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any medication, or with disorders of [[liver]] function (it may aggravate hepatic dysfunction).

[[Weakness]], [[light-headedness]], [[sleepiness]] or other [[symptoms]] may occur. In the event of such symptoms, the dosage should be reduced or treatment discontinued. Patients should be cautioned against engaging in potentially hazardous activities requiring alertness, such as operating machinery or driving a car.<ref name=di/>

==Side effects==
* Shock and anaphylactoid reactions: In the event of symptoms such as redness, [[itching]], [[urticaria]], [[oedema]] of the face<ref name=Ueno>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ueno T, Kawana S |title=[A case of eperisone hydrochloride (myonal)--induced drug eruption leading to erythema and angioedema] |language=Japanese |journal=Arerugi |volume=56 |issue=7 |pages=709–13 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17671415 |doi= |url=http://jja.jsaweb.jp/2007/056070709e.html}}</ref> and other parts of the body, [[dyspnoea]], etc., treatment should be discontinued and appropriate measures taken.
* Other side effects: [[anaemia]], [[rash]], [[pruritus]], sleepiness, [[insomnia]], [[headache]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], abdominal pain, [[diarrhoea]], [[constipation]], [[urinary retention]] or [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Drug interactions==
There have been reports of disturbances in [[Human eye|ocular]] [[Accommodation (eye)|accommodation]] occurring after the concomitant use of the related drug [[tolperisone]] hydrochloride and [[methocarbamol]].

==Safety in overdose==
[[Seizures]] have been reported in an infant after accidental ingestion of eperisone.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Tanno K, Narimatsu E, Takeyama Y, Asai Y |title=Infantile case of seizure induced by intoxication after accidental consumption of eperisone hydrochloride, an antispastic agent |journal=Am J Emerg Med |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=481–2 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17499672 |doi=10.1016/j.ajem.2006.09.002 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0735675706003615}}</ref>

==Future developments==
Eperisone suffers from a very low [[bioavailability]] when taken orally, as a result of high [[first pass]] intestinal [[metabolism]]; a [[transdermal patch]] containing eperisone is currently in development in [[South Korea]].<ref name=Yang/> This has shown promise, with the antispasmodic effect lasting over 24 hours, compared to one to two hours following oral administration.

Eperisone is also under investigation as an [[antihypertensive]] agent, with promising results from trials on [[beagles]].<ref>{{patent|EP|0310259|Eperisone as a hypotensive agent}}</ref>

==Brand names==
Eperisone is marketed under many brand names worldwide.<ref name=generics>Drugs.com [http://www.drugs.com/international/eperisone.html International eperisone brands] Page accessed March 10, 2016</ref>
