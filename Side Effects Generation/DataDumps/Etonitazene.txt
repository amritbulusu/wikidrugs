It has a strong dependency potential similar to that of morphine, and a strong tendency to produce [[respiratory depression]], and is therefore not used in humans. It is however useful in addiction studies on animals. It is often used in studies requiring the animals to drink or ingest the opiate because it is not as bitter as the opiate salts, i.e., morphine sulfate.

Of these analogues, only etonitazene and clonitazene are explicitly listed as illegal drugs under UN convention and so are illegal throughout the world. The rest would only be illegal in countries such as the USA, Australia and New Zealand that have laws equivalent to the [[Federal Analog Act]].  In the United States it is a Schedule I Narcotic controlled substance with a DEA ACSCN of 9624 and a zero annual manufacturing quota as of 2013.

Etonitazene has proved very important in mapping out the opiate receptor and some experimental compounds in which phenolic groupings have been replaced with nitro groupings have proved more active than the parent compound.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Illicit production and sale of etonitazene has been limited.

One of the first compounds investigated by the Swiss team was 1-(β-diethylaminoethyl)-2-benzylbenzimidazole, which was found to possess 10% of the analgesic activity of morphine when tested in rodent bioassays.  This finding encouraged the group to begin a comprehensive systematic study of 2-benzylbenzimidazoles and to establish the [[structure-activity relationship]] of this new family of analgesics.  Two general synthetic methods were developed for the preparation of these compounds.

The first method involved the condensation of [[o-phenylenediamine]] with [[phenylacetonitrile]] to form a 2-benzylbenzimidazole.  The benzimidazole is then alkylated with the desired 1-chloro-2-dialkylaminoethane, forming the final product.  This particular procedure was most useful for the preparation of benzimidazoles that lacked substituents on the benzene rings.  A diagram of this method is displayed below.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hunger|first=A.|author2=Kebrle, J. |author3=Rossi, A. |author4=Hoffmann, K. |title=Benzimidazol-Derivate und verwandte Heterocyclen.

Synthesis of 1-Aminoalkyl-2-benzyl-nitro-benzimidazoles|language=GERMAN}}</ref> developed by the Swiss team first involved [[alkylation]] of [[2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene]] with 1-amino-2-diethylaminoethane to form N-(β-Diethylaminoethyl)-2,4-dinitroaniline [aka: N'-(2,4-Dinitrophenyl)-N,N-diethyl-ethane-1,2-diamine].  The 2-nitro substituent o
n the [[2,4-dinitroaniline]] compound is then selectively [[Organic redox reaction|reduced]] to the corresponding [[primary amine]] by utilizing [[ammonium sulfide]] as the [[reducing agent]].  The ammonium sulfide can be formed in situ by the addition of concentrated aqueous [[ammonium hydroxide]] followed by saturation of the solution with [[hydrogen sulfide]] gas.  The intermediate formed by the selective reduction of the 2-nitro substituent, 2-(β-Diethylaminoethylamino)-5-[[nitroaniline (disambiguation)|nitroaniline]], is then reacted with the [[hydrochloride]] salt of the imino ethyl [[ether]] of 4-ethoxy[[phenylacetonitrile]] (aka: p-ethoxybenzyl cyanide).  The imino ether, 2-(4-Ethoxyphenyl)-acetimidic acid ethyl [[ester]] hydrochloride, is prepared by dissolving the 4-substituted [[benzyl cyanide]] in a mixture of [[anhydrous]] [[ethanol]] and [[chloroform]] and then saturating this solution with dry [[hydrogen chloride]] gas.  The reaction between the 2-(β-dialkylaminoalkylamine)-5-nitroaniline and the HCl salt of the imino ethyl ether results in the formation of etonitazene.  This procedure is particularly useful in the preparation of the 4-, 5-, 6-, and 7-nitrobenzimidazoles.  Varying the choice of the substituted phenylacetic acid imino ether affords compounds with a diversity of substituents on the benzene ring at the 2- position.  A diagram of this particular synthesis as it applies to the preparation of etonitazene is shown below.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hunger|first=A.|author2=Kebrle, J. |author3=Rossi, A. |author4=Hoffmann, K. |title=Synthese basisch substituierter, analgetisch wirksamer Benzimidazol-Derivate|journal=Experientia|date=1 October 1957|volume=13|issue=10|pages=400–401|doi=10.1007/BF02161116|pmid=13473817|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/78362960/Synthese-basisch-substituierter-analgetisch-wirksamer-Benzimidazol-Derivate-Synthesis-of-analgesically-active-benzimidazole-derivatives-with-basic-s|trans_title=Synthesis of analgesically active benzimidazole derivatives with basic substitutions}}</ref>

A particularly novel, high-yielding synthesis of etonitazene was developed by FI Carroll and MC Coleman in the mid-1970s<ref>{{cite journal|last=Carroll|first=FI|author2=Coleman, MC|title=Etonitazene. An improved synthesis.|journal=Journal of Medicinal Chemistry|date=March 1975|volume=18|issue=3|pages=318–20|pmid=237125|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/78172320/Etonitazene-Improved-Synthesis-Carroll-FI-Coleman-MC-J-Med-Chem-Mar-1975-18-3-318-320|doi=10.1021/jm00237a024}}</ref> The authors were tasked with the preparation of large quantities of etonitazene, but found the conventional synthesis to be inadequate.  The problem with the conventional synthesis was the lability of the imino ether reactant, 2-(4-Ethoxyphenyl)-acetimidic acid ethyl ester (prepared by reacting 4-ethoxyphenylacetonitrile with ethanolic HCl).  The imino ether necessitated the use of [[anhydrous]] reaction conditions and was inconvenient to prepare in large quantities.  This led the authors to experiment with the use of a coupling reagent, [[EEDQ]] (N-Ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline), in order to promote the condensation of 2-(2-diethylaminoethylamino)-5-nitroaniline with 4-ethoxyphenylacetic acid.  Incredibly, the authors discovered that when this condensation was performed in the presence of 2 or more molar equivalents of EEDQ (added portionwise in 3 steps) in [[THF]] at 50&nbsp;°C for 192 hours (8 days), a near quantitative yield (100%) of etonitazene was obtained.  In addition to the impressive improvement in yield over the conventional procedure, the work up procedure was greatly simplified since [[quinoline]], [[carbon dioxide]], and [[ethanol]] were the only by-products formed. A diagram of this procedure is shown below.

Org. Chem., 2011, 76(23), 9577-9583] from a South Korean team outlined a novel, one-pot synthesis for substituted and unsubstituted 2-benzyl-benzimidazoles that can be easily adapted to the preparation of etonitazene.  The three component synthesis of the direct etonitazene precursor, 2-(4-Ethoxybenzyl)-5-nitro-1H-benzoimidazole, consists of a 2-Bromo- or 2-Iodo-5-nitro-phenylamine (1.0 molar equivalent), a 4-substituted [[benzaldehyde]] (1.2 equiv), and [[sodium azide]] (2 equiv).  The 2-Halo-5-nitro-phenylamine requires a bromo or iodo group for optimal activity.  2-Chloro-phenylamines are completely unreactive.  In addition to these three components, the reaction was optimized in the presence of 0.05 molar equivalents (5&nbsp;mol%) of a catalyst, copper(I) chloride, and 5&nbsp;mol% of ligand, TMEDA ([[tetramethylethylenediamine]]).  After heating these components at 120&nbsp;°C for 12 hours in [[Dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]], the direct etonitazene precursor, 2-(4-Ethoxybenzyl)-5-nitro-1H-benzoimidazole, was formed in an approx 80-90% yield.  The [[secondary amine]] nitrogen of 2-(4-Ethoxybenzyl)-5-nitro-1H-benzoimidazole was then alkylated with (2-Chloroethyl)diethylamine to form etonitazene.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hunger|first=A.|author2=Kebrle, J. |author3=Rossi, A. |author4=Hoffmann, K. |title=Benzimidazol-Derivate und verwandte Heterocyclen.
