'''Difluoromethylenedioxyamphetamine''' ('''DiFMDA''') is a substituted derivative of [[3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine]] (MDA), which was developed by Daniel Trachsel and coworkers, along with the corresponding fluorinated derivatives of MDMA, MDEA, BDB and MBDB, with the aim of finding a non-neurotoxic drug able to be used as a less harmful substitute for [[entactogen]]ic drugs such as [[MDMA]]. Since a major route of the normal metabolism of these compounds is scission of the [[methylenedioxy]] ring, producing neurotoxic metabolites such as [[alpha-methyldopamine]], it was hoped that the difluoromethylenedioxy [[bioisostere]] would show increased metabolic stability and less toxicity.<ref name="pmid17193269">{{cite journal |vauthors=Trachsel D, Hadorn M, Baumberger F |title=Synthesis of fluoro analogues of 3,4-(methylenedioxy)amphetamine (MDA) and its derivatives |journal=Chemistry & Biodiversity |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=326–36 |date=March 2006 |pmid=17193269 |doi=10.1002/cbdv.200690035 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid21413808">{{cite journal |author=Meanwell NA |title=Synopsis of Some Recent Tactical Application of Bioisosteres in Drug Design |journal=Journal of Medicinal Chemistry |volume= 54|issue= 8|pages= 2529–91|date=March 2011 |pmid=21413808 |doi=10.1021/jm1013693 |url=}}</ref>

These compounds have not yet been tested in animals to verify whether they show similar pharmacological activity to the non-fluorinated parent compounds, although ''in vitro'' binding studies show DFMDA to have a [[Serotonin transporter|SERT]] affinity in between that of MDA and MDMA.<ref name="pmid18354055">{{cite journal |vauthors=Walline CC, Nichols DE, Carroll FI, Barker EL |title=Comparative molecular field analysis using selectivity fields reveals residues in the third transmembrane helix of the serotonin transporter associated with substrate and antagonist recognition |journal=The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics |volume=325 |issue=3 |pages=791–800 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18354055 |pmc=2637348 |doi=10.1124/jpet.108.136200 |url=}}</ref> However, there is known to be a lack of bulk tolerance at this position of the molecule, shown by the generally reduced activity of the [[Ethylidenedioxyamphetamine|ethylidenedioxy]] and isopropylidenedioxy analogues.<ref name="pmid513074">{{cite journal |vauthors=Nichols DE, Kostuba LJ |title=Steric effects of substituents on phenethylamine hallucinogens. 3,4-(Methylenedioxy)amphetamine analogues alkylated on the dioxole ring |journal=Journal of Medicinal Chemistry |volume=22 |issue=10 |pages=1264–7 |date=October 1979 |pmid=513074 |doi= 10.1021/jm00196a022|url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid2623014">{{cite journal |vauthors=Nichols DE, Oberlender R, Burris K, Hoffman AJ, Johnson MP |title=Studies of dioxole ring substituted 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) analogues |journal=Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Behavior |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=571–6 |date=November 1989 |pmid=2623014 |doi= 10.1016/0091-3057(89)90560-1|url=}}</ref> It is also now generally accepted that MDMA neurotoxicity results from a variety of different causes and is not solely due to accumulation of alpha-methyldopamine,<ref name="pmid19373443">{{cite journal |vauthors=Capela JP, Carmo H, Remião F, Bastos ML, Meisel A, Carvalho F |title=Molecular and cellular mechanisms of ecstasy-induced neurotoxicity: an overview |journal=Molecular Neurobiology |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=210–71 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19373443 |doi=10.1007/s12035-009-8064-1 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid20420572">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sarkar S, Schmued L |title=Neurotoxicity of ecstasy (MDMA): an overview |journal=Current Pharmaceutical Biotechnology |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=460–9 |date=August 2010 |pmid=20420572 |doi= 10.2174/138920110791591490|url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid21074589">{{cite journal |vauthors=Escubedo E, Abad S, Torres I, Camarasa J, Pubill D |title=Comparative neurochemical profile of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine and its metabolite alpha-methyldopamine on key targets of MDMA neurotoxicity |journal=Neurochemistry International |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=92–101 |date=January 2011 |pmid=21074589 |doi=10.1016/j.neuint.2010.11.001 |url=}}</ref> making it unclear how much less neurotoxic DFMDA and related drugs would be in practice.
