'''Fenofibrate''', marketed as '''Tricor''' and under several other brand names, is a [[medication|drug]] of the [[fibrate]] class.  It is mainly used to reduce [[cholesterol]] levels in people at risk of [[cardiovascular disease]]. Like other fibrates, it reduces both [[low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL) and [[very low density lipoprotein]] (VLDL) levels, as well as increasing [[high-density lipoprotein]] (HDL) levels and reducing [[triglyceride]] levels.<ref name="feno"/> It is used alone or along with [[statin]]s in the treatment of [[hypercholesterolemia]] and [[hypertriglyceridemia]]. However, due to lack of cardiovascular benefit in several large trials and the risk of side effects such as muscle damage, the FDA withdrew approval for the use in high cholesterol treatment in combination with statins. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/862022|title=Medscape Log In|website=www.medscape.com|access-date=2017-02-09}}</ref>

<!-- History, society and culture -->
Fenofibrate has been used since 1975 and is one of the most commonly prescribed fibrates.<ref name="feno">{{cite journal |vauthors=Yang LP, Keating GM |title=Fenofibric acid: in combination therapy in the treatment of mixed dyslipidemia |journal=Am J Cardiovasc Drugs |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=401–9 |year=2009 |pmid=19929038 |doi=10.2165/11203920-000000000-00000}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
Fenofibrate is mainly used for primary [[hypercholesterolemia]] or mixed [[dyslipidemia]]. Fenofibrate appears to decrease the risk of [[cardiovascular disease]] and possibly [[diabetic retinopathy]] in those with [[diabetes mellitus]],<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Wong TY, Simó R, Mitchell P |title=Fenofibrate - a potential systemic treatment for diabetic retinopathy?|journal=Am J Ophthalmol|date=Jul 2012|volume=154 | issue = 1 |pages=6–12|doi=10.1016/j.ajo.2012.03.013|pmid=22709833}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fazio S |title=More clinical lessons from the FIELD study |journal=Cardiovasc Drugs Ther |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=235–41 |year=2009 |pmid=19160032 |doi=10.1007/s10557-008-6160-5}}</ref> and firstly indicated for the reduction in the progression of diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes and existing diabetic retinopathy in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|title=Australian Public Assessment Report for fenofibrate|url=https://www.tga.gov.au/file/6794/download|website=TGA|publisher=TGA|accessdate=27 June 2015}}</ref> It also appears to be helpful in decreasing [[amputation]]s of the lower legs in this same group of people.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Steiner G |title=How can we improve the management of vascular risk in type 2 diabetes: insights from FIELD |journal=Cardiovasc Drugs Ther |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=403–8 |year=2009 |pmid=19757004 |doi=10.1007/s10557-009-6190-7}}</ref> Fenofibrate also has an [[off-label use]] as an added therapy of [[hyperuricemia|high blood uric acid levels]] in people who have [[gout]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Khanna D, Fitzgerald JD, Khanna PP, Bae S, Singh MK, Neogi T, Pillinger MH, Merill J, Lee S, Prakash S, Kaldas M, Gogia M, Perez-Ruiz F, Taylor W, Lioté F, Choi H, Singh JA, Dalbeth N, Kaplan S, Niyyar V, Jones D, Yarows SA, Roessler B, Kerr G, King C, Levy G, Furst DE, Edwards NL, Mandell B, Schumacher HR, Robbins M, Wenger N, Terkeltaub R |title=2012 American College of Rheumatology guidelines for management of gout.

It is used in addition to [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] to reduce elevated [[low-density lipoprotein]] cholesterol (LDL), total [[cholesterol]], [[triglycerides]] (TG), and apolipoprotein B (apo B), and to increase [[high-density lipoprotein]] cholesterol (HDL) in adults with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia.<ref name="ReferenceB">[http://www.rxabbott.com/pdf/tricorpi.pdf Package Insert: Abbot Laboratories (October 2010)]</ref>
*Severe [[hypertriglyceridemia]] type IV or V 
It is used in addition to diet for treatment of adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Improving glycemic control in diabetics showing fasting chylomicronemia will usually decrease the need for pharmacologic intervention.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

Statins remain the first line for treatment of blood cholesterol. AHA guidelines from 2013 did not find evidence for routine use of additional medications.<ref name="ATP4 Guidelines">{{cite journal |vauthors=Stone NJ, Robinson JG, Lichtenstein AH, Bairey Merz CN, Blum CB, Eckel RH, Goldberg AC, Gordon D, Levy D, Lloyd-Jones DM, McBride P, Schwartz JS, Shero ST, Smith SC, Watson K, Wilson PW, Eddleman KM, Jarrett NM, LaBresh K, Nevo L, Wnek J, Anderson JL, Halperin JL, Albert NM, Bozkurt B, Brindis RG, Curtis LH, DeMets D, Hochman JS, Kovacs RJ, Ohman EM, Pressler SJ, Sellke FW, Shen WK, Smith SC, Tomaselli GF |title=2013 ACC/AHA guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk in adults: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines |journal=Circulation |volume=129 |issue=25 Suppl 2 |pages=S1–45 |year=2014 |pmid=24222016 |doi=10.1161/01.cir.0000437738.63853.7a}}</ref>

Additionally, in 2016, the FDA filed "Withdrawal of Approval of Indications Related to the Coadministration With Statins in Applications for Niacin Extended-Release Tablets and Fenofibric Acid Delayed Release Capsules" noting "the Agency has concluded that the totality of the scientific evidence no longer supports the conclusion that a drug-induced reduction in triglyceride levels and/or increase in HDL cholesterol levels in statin-treated patients results in a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events. Consistent with this conclusion, FDA has determined that the benefits of niacin ER tablets and fenofibric acid DR capsules for coadministration with statins no longer outweigh the risks, and the approvals for this indication should be withdrawn."<ref>https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2016-08887.pdf</ref>

==Contraindications==
Fenofibrate is contraindicated in:<ref name="ReferenceB"/>
* Patients with severe [[renal impairment]], including those receiving dialysis (2.7-fold increase in exposure, and increased accumulation during chronic dosing in patients with estimated [[glomerular filtration rate]] < 30 mL/min)
* Patients with active liver disease, including those with [[primary biliary cirrhosis]] and unexplained persistent [[liver function test]] abnormalities
* Patients with preexisting [[gallbladder]] disease
* Nursing mothers
* Patients with known [[hypersensitivity]] to fenofibrate or fenofibric acid

==Adverse effects==
The most common adverse events (>3% of patients with coadministered statins) are<ref name="Fenofibric acid label information"/>
*Headache
*Back pain
*[[Nasopharyngitis]]
*Nausea
*[[Myalgia]]
*Joint pain or [[arthralgia]]
*Diarrhea
*Upper respiratory tract infection

===Precautions===
Musculoskeletal
*[[Myopathy]] and [[rhabdomyolysis]]; increased risk when coadminstered with a statin, particularly in the elderly and patients with [[diabetes]], [[renal failure]], [[hypothyroidism]]<ref name="Fenofibric acid label information">Fenofibric Acid FDA Label Prescribing Information{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/201573Orig1s000lbl.pdf|publisher=FDA|title=FDA Label Information}}</ref> 
Hepatotoxicity
*Can increase serum [[transaminases]]; liver tests should be monitored periodically<ref name="Fenofibric acid label information"/>
Nephrotoxicity
*Can increase serum [[creatinine]] levels; renal function should be monitored periodically in patients with renal insufficiency<ref name="Fenofibric acid label information"/>
Biliary
*Can increase cholesterol excretion into the bile, leading to risk of [[cholelithiasis]]; if suspected, gallbladder studies are indicated. See "Interaction" section under [[Bile acid sequestrant]]<ref name="Fenofibric acid label information"/>
Coagulation/Bleeding
*Exercise caution in concomitant treatment with oral coumarin anticoagulants (e.g. [[warfarin]]). Adjust the dosage of coumarin to maintain the prothrombin time/INR at desired level to prevent bleeding complications.<ref name="Fenofibric acid label information"/>

==Overdose==
“There is no specific treatment for overdose with fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules. General supportive care is indicated, including monitoring of [[vital signs]] and observation of clinical status”. Additionally, [[hemodialysis]] should not be considered as an overdose treatment option because fenofibrate heavily binds to plasma proteins and does not dialyze well.<ref name="Fenofibric acid label information" />

==Interactions==
These drug interactions with fenofibrate are considered major and may need therapy modifications:
*Bile acid sequestrants (e.g. [[cholestyramine]], [[colestipol]], etc.): If taken together, bile acid resins may bind to fenofibrate, resulting in a decrease in fenofibrate absorption. To maximize absorption, patients need to separate administration by at least 1 h before or 4 h to 6 h after taking the bile acid sequestrant.<ref name="Fenofibric acid label information" /><ref>Product Information: TriCor(TM), fenofibrate. Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL, 1998.</ref>
*Immunosuppressants (e.g. [[ciclosporin]] or [[tacrolimus]]): An increased risk of renal dysfunction exists with concomitant use of immunosuppressants and fenofibrate. Approach with caution when coadministering additional medications that decrease renal function.<ref>Product Information: Sandimmune(R) oral capsules, oral solution, intravenous injection, cyclosporine oral capsules, oral solution, intravenous injection. Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ, 2010.</ref>
*Vitamin K antagonists (e.g. [[warfarin]]): As previously mentioned, fenofibrate interacts with coumarin anticoagulants to increase the risk of bleeding. Dosage adjustment of vitamin K antagonist may be necessary.<ref name="Fenofibric acid label information" />
*Statins: Combination of [[statin]]s and fenofibrate may increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis or myopathy.<ref>Product Information: TRICOR(R) oral tablets, fenofibrate oral tablets. Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL, 2007.</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
"In summary, enhanced catabolism of triglyceride-rich particles and reduced secretion of VLDL underlie the hypotriglyceridemic effect of fibrates, whereas their effect on HDL metabolism is associated with changes in HDL [[apolipoprotein]] expression."<ref name="staels"/>

Fenofibrate is a fibric acid derivative, a [[prodrug]] comprising fenofibric acid linked to an isopropyl ester. It lowers lipid levels by activating [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha]] (PPARα). PPARα activates [[lipoprotein lipase]] and reduces apoprotein CIII, which increases lipolysis and elimination of triglyceride-rich particles from plasma.<ref name="staels">{{cite journal |vauthors=Staels B, Dallongeville J, Auwerx J, Schoonjans K, Leitersdorf E, Fruchart JC |title=Mechanism of action of fibrates on lipid and lipoprotein metabolism |journal=Circulation |volume=98 |issue=19 |pages=2088–93 |year=1998 |pmid=9808609 |url=https://circ.ahajournals.org/content/98/19/2088.full |doi=10.1161/01.cir.98.19.2088}}</ref>

PPARα also increases apoproteins AI and AII, reduces VLDL- and LDL-containing apoprotein B, and increases HDL-containing apoprotein AI and AII.

==Formulations==
Fenofibrate is available in several [[pharmaceutical form|formulations]] and is sold under several brand names, including Tricor by AbbVie, Lipofen by Kowa Pharmaceuticals America Inc, Lofibra by [[Teva Pharmaceutical Industries|Teva]], Lipanthyl, Lipidil, Lipantil micro and Supralip by [[Abbott Laboratories]], Fenocor-67 by Ordain Health Care, Fibractiv 105/35 by Cogentrix Pharma( India), Fenogal by SMB Laboratories, Antara by Oscient Pharmaceuticals, Tricheck by Zydus (CND), Atorva TG by Zydus Medica, Golip by GolgiUSA and Stanlip by Ranbaxy (India). Different formulations may differ in terms of [[pharmacokinetic]] properties, particularly [[bioavailability]]; some must be taken with meals, whereas others may be taken without regard to food.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ling H, Luoma JT, Hilleman D |title=A review of currently available fenofibrate and fenofibric acid formulations |journal=Cardiol Res |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=47–55 |year=2013 |doi=10.4021/cr270w}}</ref>

The active form of fenofibrate, fenofibric acid, is also available in the United States, sold as Trilipix. Fenofibric acid may be taken without regard to the timing of meals.<ref name="Fenofibric acid label information"/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Alagona P |title=Fenofibric acid: a new fibrate approved for use in combination with statin for the treatment of mixed dyslipidemia |journal=Vasc Health Risk Manag |volume=6 |issue= |pages=351–62 |year=2010 |pmid=20531954 |pmc=2879297 |doi=10.2147/vhrm.s6714}}</ref>

When fenofibrate and a statin are given as combination therapy, it is recommended that fenofibrate be given in the morning and the statin at night, so that the peak dosages do not overlap.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Wierzbicki AS, Mikhailidis DP, Wray R, Schacter M, Cramb R, Simpson WG, Byrne CB |title=Statin-fibrate combination: therapy for hyperlipidemia: a review |journal=Curr Med Res Opin |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=155–68 |year=2003 |pmid=12814127 |doi=10.1185/030079903125001668}}</ref>

===Controversy===
In the United States, Tricor was reformulated in 2005. This reformulation is controversial, as it is seen as an attempt to stifle competition from generic equivalents of the drug,<ref name="fdanews.com">Abbott's request to dismiss the antitrust charge over Tricor was rejected. FDANews, Drug Daily Bulletin, (June 1, 2006) [http://www.fdanews.com/newsletter/article?issueId=9284&articleId=87219]</ref> and is the subject of [[antitrust]] litigation by generic drug manufacturer [[Teva Pharmaceutical Industries|Teva]].<ref name="fdanews.com"/> Also available in the United States, Lofibra is available in 54 and 160&nbsp;mg tablets, as well as 67, 134, and 200;mg [[Micronization|micronized]] capsules.<ref>[http://www.lofibra.com/ TEVA Pharmartsau6i8mkst7oceutical Lofibra Product Site]</ref>  Generic equivalents of Lofibra capsules are currently available in all three strengths in the United States.  In Europe, it is available in either coated tablet or capsule; the strength range includes 67, 145, 160 and 200&nbsp;mg. The differences among strengths are a result of altered [[bioavailability]] (the fraction absorbed by the body) due to particle size. For example, 200&nbsp;mg can be replaced by 160&nbsp;mg micronized fenofibrate. The 145&nbsp;mg strength is a new strength that appeared in 2005-2006 which also replaces 200 or 160&nbsp;mg as the fenofibrate is nanonised (i.e. the particle size is below 400&nbsp;nm).

==History==
Fenofibrate was first synthesized in 1974 as a derivative of [[clofibrate]], and was launched on the French market shortly thereafter. It was initially known as procetofen, and was later renamed fenofibrate' to comply with [[World Health Organization]] [[International Nonproprietary Name]] guidelines.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lalloyer F, Staels B |title=Fibrates, glitazones, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors |journal=Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=894–9 |year=2010 |pmid=20393155 |pmc=2997800 |doi=10.1161/ATVBAHA.108.179689}}</ref>

Fenofibrate was developed by Groupe Fournier SA of France, which was acquired in 2005 by Solvay Pharmaceuticals, a [[Business|business unit]] of the Belgian corporation [[Solvay (company)|Solvay S.A.]]. In 2009, Solvay was, in turn, acquired by Abbott Laboratories (now AbbVie).

==Research==
In adult rat studies using [[pentylenetetrazol]] and lithium-[[pilocarpine]] models, fenofibrate exhibits [[anticonvulsant]] properties comparable to the [[ketogenic diet]] potentially via agonism of PPAR-a. These findings may be useful for future ketogenic diet study protocols.<ref name=Porta2009>{{cite journal |vauthors=Porta N, Vallée L, Lecointe C, Bouchaert E, Staels B, Bordet R, Auvin S |title=Fenofibrate, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha agonist, exerts anticonvulsive properties |journal=Epilepsia |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=943–8 |year=2009 |pmid=19054409 |doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2008.01901.x}}</ref>
