'''Escaline''' or '''3,5-[[methoxy]]-4-[[ethoxy]][[phenethylamine]]''' is a [[psychedelic drug]] and [[entheogen]] of the [[phenethylamine]] class of compounds. Escaline was first synthesized and reported in the scientific literature by Benington, et al., in 1954, but was later re-examined in the laboratory of [[David E. Nichols]], who prepared a series of [[mescaline]] analogues that included escaline, [[proscaline]], and [[isoproscaline]].  The effects of this and related [[mescaline]] analogues in humans were first described by [[Alexander Shulgin]]. In his book ''[[PiHKAL|PiHKAL (Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved)]]'', Shulgin lists the dosage range as 40 to 60&nbsp;mg, consumed orally.  The duration of action was stated to be 8–12 hours. 

Escaline is the [[phenethylamine]] analog of [[3C-E]] and the 4-ethoxy analog of [[mescaline]].

== Legal status ==
Escaline is illegal in Sweden as of 26 January 2016.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/nyheter-och-press/nyhetsarkiv/2015/november/31-nya-amnen-kan-klassas-som-narkotika-eller-halsofarlig-vara/ | title=31 nya ämnen kan klassas som narkotika eller hälsofarlig vara | publisher=Folkhälsomyndigheten | language=Swedish | date=November 2015}}</ref>
