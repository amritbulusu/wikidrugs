'''Wyeth''' was a [[pharmaceutical company]] purchased by [[Pfizer]] in 2009. The company was founded in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], in 1860 as John Wyeth and Brother.  It was later known as '''American Home Products''' before being renamed to '''Wyeth''' in 2002.  Its headquarters moved to [[Collegeville, Pennsylvania]], and [[Madison, New Jersey|Madison]], [[New Jersey]], before its headquarters were consolidated with [[Pfizer]]'s in [[New York City]] after the 2009 merger. The infant and maternal nutrition business was acquired by [[Nestlé]] in 2012.

Wyeth manufactured [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter (OTC) drug]]s [[Robitussin]] and the [[analgesic]] [[Advil]] ([[ibuprofen]]) as well as prescription drugs [[Premarin]] and [[Effexor]].

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2016}}

===1860&ndash;1899===
In 1860, pharmacists John (1834&ndash;1907) and Frank Wyeth opened a drugstore with a small research lab on Walnut Street in Philadelphia. In 1862, on the suggestion of doctors, they began to manufacture large quantities of commonly ordered medicines. They were successful, and in 1864 they began supplying medicines and [[Meat extract|beef extract]] to the Union army during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

In 1872, Henry Bowers, an employee of Wyeth, developed one of the first rotary compressed tablet machines in the [[United States]]. This enabled the mass production of medicines with unprecedented precision and speed. It was successful, and the Wyeth brothers won multiple awards at the [[Centennial Exhibition]]. In 1883, Wyeth opened its first international facility in [[Montreal]], [[Canada]], and began vaccine production. Six years later a fire destroyed the brothers' original Walnut Street store, and they sold the retail business and focused on mass production. [[Cobalt blue glass]] bottles embossed with either "Wyeth" or "John Wyeth & Brother" in the glass are among the most popular [[antique]] bottles sought after by collectors.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===1900&ndash;1929===
John Wyeth died in 1907 and his only son, Stuart, became the company's president. The Whitehall building in downtown [[Manhattan]] became the corporation's first headquarters. Global sales increased due to the sales of Wyeth's [[Kolynos]] brand of toothpaste. In 1929, Stuart Wyeth died and left controlling interest to [[Harvard University]].

===1930&ndash;1949===
In 1930, Wyeth purchased [[Anacin]], a product for tension headaches which quickly became the company's flagship product. One year later, Harvard sold Wyeth to American Home Products (AHP) for [[United States dollar|US$]]2.9 million.

In 1935, Alvin G. Brush, a [[Certified Public Accountant]], became [[CEO]] of the organization and served for 30 years. Under Brush's leadership, 34 new companies were acquired in 15 years, including [[Chef Boyardee]] and the ''S.M.A. Corporation'', a pharmaceutical firm specializing in infant formulas. Wyeth also made its first licensing deal, acquiring an antibiotic for [[arthritis]] [[vaccine]] research.

In 1941, the US entered [[World War II]], and AHP shipped typical wartime drugs such as [[sulfa]] bacteriostatics, [[blood plasma]], [[typhus]] vaccine, [[quinine]], and [[Quinacrine|atabrine]] tablets. Wyeth was later rewarded for its contribution to the war effort. During this time, Wyeth launched its [[penicillin]] research facility with G. Raymond Rettew. In 1943, Wyeth purchased ''G. Washington Coffee Refining Company'', an [[instant coffee]] company created by [[George Washington (inventor)|George Washington]].

In 1943, AHP merged with ''Ayerst, McKenna and Harrison, Ltd.'' of Canada. With this merger came [[Premarin]], the world's first conjugated [[estrogen]] medicine, which was a flagship product for AHP until 2002, when preliminary results from the [[Women's Health Initiative]] linked it to a number of negative effects, including increased risk for breast cancer. Sales subsequently fell off worldwide.

AHP was one of 22 companies selected by the government in 1944 to manufacture penicillin for the military, and later for the general public.

In 1945, AHP acquired the Fort Dodge Serum Company, entering the animal health field.

===1950&ndash;1969===
In 1951, AHP launched [[Antabuse]], a drug for the treatment of [[alcoholism]], as well as the [[antihistamine]] [[Phenergan]]. Ansolyen was launched the next year as a [[high blood pressure]] medication. The [[anticonvulsant]] [[Mysoline]] was introduced in 1954. Other drugs introduced during this time include [[Isordil]], a [[vasodilator]] for treatment of [[Angina pectoris|angina]], [[Dryvax]], a [[freeze-dried]] [[smallpox]] vaccine, and Ovral, a [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]. Pharmaceuticals were generating an ever-increasing percentage of AHP's sales.

AHP became a leading US vaccine producer after supplying [[polio]] vaccine for [[Jonas Salk|Salk]] trials. The corporate headquarters were moved to [[Radnor, Pennsylvania|Radnor]], Pennsylvania, where they remained until 2003. William F. Laporte became the Chairman and President of AHP in 1965, and served until 1981.

The [[World Health Organization]] initiated the Global Smallpox Eradication Program in 1967, and approached AHP to develop a better injection system for smallpox vaccines which could be used in the field. AHP waived [[patent]] royalties on its innovative [[bifurcated needle]], aiding in the delivery of over 200 million smallpox vaccines per year.

===1970&ndash;1989===
AHP's oral contraceptives became popular in the US. John W. Culligan, after becoming Chairman and CEO in 1981, spun off less profitable lines and focused resources on consumer and prescription drugs. AHP made history in 1984 with the introduction of [[Advil]], the first nonprescription [[ibuprofen]] in America, as well as the most famous prescription-to-OTC switch in history.

John R. Stafford became CEO and Chairman in 1986. He completed the divestiture of non-core businesses such as household products (for example the [[Slaymaker lock company]]), foods, candy ([[Brach's Candy]]), and medical devices (e.g., its Sherwood-Medical Company was sold to Tyco-Kendal in 1997). In 1987 AHP merged its Wyeth and Ayerst divisions to unite its pharmaceutical businesses, forming Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories.<ref>Staff, The Pink Sheet. Aug 31, 1987 [https://pink.pharmamedtechbi.com/PS012424/WYETH-AND-AYERST-TO-MERGE-UNDER-LEADERSHIP-OF-WYETHs-CANAVAN-NEW-WYETHAYERST-LABS-WILL-HAVE-SALES-OF-25-MIL-AND-SALES-FORCE-OF-1750 Leadership of Wyeth's Canavan; New Wyeth-Ayerst Labs Will Have Sales of $2.5 Mil. and Sales Force Of 1,750]</ref>

In the late 1980s, AHP acquired the animal health businesses of [[Bristol-Myers]] and [[Parke-Davis]]. In negotiations that lasted from 1986 to 1989, AHP acquired A.H. Robins which had been driven into bankruptcy by litigation over [[Dalkon Shield]], and which also sold [[Metoclopramide|Reglan]], [[Robitussin]], [[ChapStick]], and [[Dimetapp]],<ref>Staff, Virginia Historical Society. [http://www.vahistorical.org/collections-and-resources/how-we-can-help-your-research/researcher-resources/finding-aids/ah-robins A.H. Robins Company] Page accessed August 24, 2016</ref> and merging it into its Whitehall unit to establish its Whitehall-Robins Division.{{cn|date=August 2016}}

===1990&ndash;1999===
In 1990, Reckitt & Colman (now [[Reckitt Benckiser]]) acquired Boyle-Midway from American Home Products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-03/business/fi-850_1_junk-bond|title=Companies Considering Takeovers Now Look to the Global Market : Investment: The junk bond fueled frenzy of the '80s is over.

[[Premarin]] became the most prescribed drug in the US in 1993. Effexor ([[venlafaxine]] HCl), the first [[serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor]] (SNRI), is introduced for the treatment of [[clinical depression]] and is later indicated for [[general anxiety disorder|generalized anxiety disorder]] and [[social anxiety disorder]].

In 1993, AHP founded the ''Women's Health Research Institute'', the only institute in the pharmaceutical industry entirely dedicated to research in women's health. The Institute conducts trials in [[menopause|menopausal]] issues, [[endometriosis]], [[contraception]], and more.

In 1994, AHP acquired [[American Cyanamid]] and its subsidiary Lederle Laboratories. This acquisition brought the Lederle Praxis vaccines, new [[research and development]] capacity, and [[Centrum (multivitamin)|Centrum]], the leading US [[multivitamin]]. AHP's sales topped [[United States dollar|US$]]13 billion in 1995; two years later, [[Premarin]] became the company's first brand to reach [[United States dollar|US$]]1 billion in sales.

In 1995, AHP acquired the animal health division of [[Solvay (company)|Solvay]], which was folded into Fort Dodge Animal Health. The acquisition gave Fort Dodge Animal Health strong market presence in Europe and Asia as well as expanding its product portfolio to include swine and poultry vaccines.

In 1996, AHP spun off its food unit as [[International Home Foods]]. International Home Foods was purchased by [[ConAgra Foods]] in 2000.  AHP also acquired full ownership of [[Genetics Institute, Inc.]] after acquiring a majority interest in 1992.<ref>[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/wyeth-history/ History of Wyeth] at ´Fundinguniverse.com. Retrieved 25.10.2012.</ref>

In 1997, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) requested that AHP withdraw its controversial diet drug [[fenfluramine]] from the market by after several reports of deaths and other health problems associated with the drug combination known as [[fen-phen]] occurred.<ref>{{Cite journal | author1 = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) | title = Cardiac valvulopathy associated with exposure to fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services interim public health recommendations, November 1997 | journal = MMWR.

In 1998, British pharmaceutical giant [[SmithKline Beecham]] abandoned an estimated $70 billion merger with AHP. The deal was reportedly killed in response to British regulators who feared losing jobs to a proposed US headquarters location.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} (SmithKline Beecham merged with [[Glaxo Wellcome]] in 1999 to form the world's largest drug company.)

In 1999, another AHP merger fell through, this time a proposed $34 billion merger-of-equals with chemical and biotech manufacturer [[Monsanto Company]]. Though the companies issued a combined statement saying the breakup was mutual "because (the deal) was not in the best interests of shareholders", rumors circulated that AHP had canceled the deal due to issues in the soon-to-be-combined boardroom. (Monsanto announced in December 1999 that it would merge with [[Pharmacia]] & [[Upjohn]] instead; the new conglomerate eventually unloaded Monsanto again, before being bought themselves by [[Pfizer]] in 2003.)

===2000&ndash;2009===
In 2000, American Home Products lost a [[United States dollar|US$]]65 billion friendly takeover bid for rival drug company [[Warner-Lambert]]. After the merger announcement, [[Pfizer]] offered a competing hostile bid, primarily to save its joint venture with Warner over [[Lipitor]] (at the time the biggest-selling prescription drug in the world). At one point talks were under way in which [[Procter & Gamble]] would help by buying both companies in a wild three-way merger, a rumor which cost P&G a 10% drop in its stock price.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Although both CEOs eventually toured the world to defend the deal to the company's shareholders, Pfizer won Warner-Lambert and formed the second largest drug company in the world, while AHP had to settle for a [[United States dollar|US$]]1.8 billion [[poison pill|poison-pill]] payment.

In March 2001, Robert Essner was appointed as CEO of AHP, replacing John Stafford.<ref>Susan Warner for ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' March 07, 2001 [http://articles.philly.com/2001-03-07/business/25329194_1_ahp-robert-essner-pharmaceutical-operations American Home Taps President To Be CEO]</ref>

On March 11, 2002, American Home Products changed its name to Wyeth, having spun off unrelated businesses in order to focus on pharmaceuticals.<ref name=NYT2002>Melody Petersen for ''The New York Times''. March 11, 2002 [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/11/business/american-home-is-changing-name-to-wyeth.html American Home Is Changing Name to Wyeth]</ref>

As part of the [[Women's Health Initiative]] sponsored by the [[National Institutes of Health]], a large-scale clinical trial for [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] showed that long-term use of [[progestin]] and [[estrogen]] may increase the risk of [[stroke]]s, [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]s, [[blood clot]]s, and [[breast cancer]]. Following these results, Wyeth experienced a significant decline in its sales of Premarin, Prempro (conjugated [[equine]] [[estrogen]]s), and related hormones,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} from over $2 billion in 2002 to just over $1 billion in 2006.<ref>http://www.wyeth.com/irj/servlet/prt/portal/prtroot/com.sap.km.cm.docs/wyeth_xml/home/news/announcements/1170158273391.pdf  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127184549/http://www.wyeth.com/irj/servlet/prt/portal/prtroot/com.sap.km.cm.docs/wyeth_xml/home/news/announcements/1170158273391.pdf |date=November 27, 2007 }}</ref> The results from the study were significant enough that Wyeth terminated the trials early due to a fear that their participants may be at risk.

Wyeth, as a corporation, filed a "citizens' complaint" with the US FDA on October 16, 2005, requesting that the FDA take action against pharmacies who compound, manufacture, or sell unlicensed [[Bioidentical hormone replacement therapy]] (BHRT) drugs to their patients. Specifically, Wyeth asserted that the BHRT drugs are not licensed by the FDA according to section 505 of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, misbranded and adulterated per sections 501 and 502 of 21 U.S.C. (paragraphs 351, 352, and 355).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/DOCKETS/dockets/05p0411/05p-0411-cp00001-01-vol1.pdf | format = PDF | last = Botha | first = S | date = 2005-10-06 | accessdate = 2010-01-27 | title = Submission of Citizen Petition on Behalf of Wyeth | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|FDA]] }}</ref> Drug manufacturers are required to demonstrate through clinical trials that marketed drugs are safe and efficacious, a process that BHRT drugs have not undergone. If honored, the request would require the same safety and efficacy data for those primarily engaged in [[alternative medicine]].

The [[European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection]] blamed the presence of illegal steroids in the food supply on "fraudulent exchange and disposal of pharmaceutical waste". A Wyeth factory disposing of the byproducts from synthetic [[progesterone]] manufacture was the source of the contamination.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn2551 |title=Hormone food scandal rocks Europe |publisher=Newscientist.com |date=2002-07-16 |accessdate=2012-08-11}}</ref>

In 2003 Wyeth reportedly contributed funds to a not-for-profit support group, The Meningitis Centre, which lobbied the [[Australia]]n government to introduce universal immunisation against [[Pneumococcus|pneumococcal]] disease.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/12/21/1071941610958.html |title=Drug giant linked to immunisation campaign |publisher=Theage.com.au |date= 2003-12-22|accessdate=2012-08-11 |location=Melbourne |first=Gary |last=Hughes}}</ref> Wyeth produced the only [[pneumococcal vaccine]] approved for young children in Australia.

In September 2007, Bernard Poussot was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer effective on January 1, 2008.<ref>[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/5187/000119312507211997/dex991.htm Wyeth Press Release: Wyeth Announces Election of Bernard Poussot as CEO of Company] September 27, 2007</ref>

During June 2009, an Arkansas federal judge granted public access to evidence that Wyeth Pharmaceuticals "ghostwrote" medical articles regarding its hormone therapy drug Prempro. Along with ''[[The New York Times]]'', PLoS Medicine, represented by the law firm Public Justice, had sought to intervene in a court case of women bringing an action in relation to Prempro and other hormone therapy drugs, in order to unseal papers that allegedly showed that Wyeth failed to disclose its role in preparing medical journal articles promoting Prempro and in recruiting academic authors to put their names on the articles for publication—that is that they practised ghost writing.<ref>[http://speakingofmedicine.plos.org/2009/07/25/successful-intervention-by-plos-medicine-and-new-york-times-in-federal-court-grants-public-access-to-evidence-that-drug-company-%e2%80%98ghostwrote%e2%80%99-medical-articles-about-hormone-therapy-dru/ Successful intervention by PLoS Medicine and ''The New York Times'' in Federal court grants public access to evidence that drug company "ghostwrote" medical articles about hormone therapy drug, Prempro]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814050249/http://speakingofmedicine.plos.org/2009/07/25/successful-intervention-by-plos-medicine-and-new-york-times-in-federal-court-grants-public-access-to-evidence-that-drug-company-%e2%80%98ghostwrote%e2%80%99-medical-articles-about-hormone-therapy-dru/ |date=August 14, 2009 }}</ref>

On October 15, 2009, Pfizer signed the final acquisition papers making Wyeth a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer, thus completing the [[United States dollar|US$]]68 billion dollar deal.<ref name=PfizerWyeth/>

===2012–present===
In 2012, [[Nestlé]] bought the infant nutrition division of Pfizer and renamed it as Wyeth Nutrition. The Wyeth brand is still owned by Pfizer.<ref>{{citation|title=Nestle close to buying Wyeth |journal=Global Times |date=2012-04-18 |url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/NEWS/tabid/99/ID/705595/Nestle-close-to-buying-Wyeth.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116093805/http://www.globaltimes.cn/NEWS/tabid/99/ID/705595/Nestle-close-to-buying-Wyeth.aspx |archivedate=November 16, 2012 }}</ref>

===Rapamune===
A "whistleblower suit" was filed against Wyeth in 2005 alleging that the company illegally marketed their drug [[Rapamune]]. Wyeth is targeted in the suit for [[off-label use|off-label marketing]], targeting specific doctors and medical facilities to increased sales of Rapamune, trying to get current transplant patients to change from their current transplant drugs to Rapamune and for specifically targeting African-Americans. According to the whistleblowers, Wyeth also provided doctors and hospitals with kickbacks to prescribe the drug in the form of grants, donations and other money.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmalot.com/2010/05/wyeth-targeted-blacks-with-illegal-marketing-lawsuit/ |title=Wyeth Marketing Targeted Blacks Illegally: Lawsuit // Pharmalot |publisher=Pharmalot.com |date=2010-05-24 |accessdate=2012-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author= Tracy Staton |url=http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/congress-joins-probe-wyeths-rapamune-marketing/2010-06-14 |title=Congress joins probe into Wyeth's Rapamune marketing |publisher=FiercePharma |date=2010-06-14 |accessdate=2012-08-11}}</ref> A US House of Representatives committee, led by Rep.

===Prempro===
Wyeth was sued for its marketing of Prempro, a [[hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]], which was implicated in the cancers of 14,000 patients. Wyeth was particularly criticised by observers for its use of 'ghostwriters' to put their names to research papers that Wyeth had paid a third party, DesignWrite, to prepare.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/sep/18/bad-science-medical-ghostwriters Medical ghostwriters who build a brand | Comment is free | The Guardian], Guardian {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wqAyvX89?url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/sep/18/bad-science-medical-ghostwriters |date=February 28, 2011 }}</ref>
