'''Tryptamine''' is a [[monoamine]] [[alkaloid]]. It contains an [[indole]] ring structure, and is structurally similar to the [[amino acid]] [[tryptophan]], from which the name derives. Tryptamine is found in [[trace amine|trace]] amounts in the [[brain]]s of [[mammal]]s and is hypothesized to play a role as a [[neuromodulator]] or [[neurotransmitter]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Jones R.S. | year = 1982 | title = Tryptamine: a neuromodulator or neurotransmitter in mammalian brain? | journal = Progress in neurobiology | volume = 19 | pages = 117&ndash;139  | doi = 10.1016/0301-0082(82)90023-5 | issue = 1&ndash;2}}</ref> Similar to other [[trace amine]]s, tryptamine binds to human [[TAAR1|trace amine-associated receptor 1]] (TAAR1) as an agonist.<ref name="Human trace amines and hTAARs October 2016 review">{{cite journal | vauthors = Khan MZ, Nawaz W | title = The emerging roles of human trace amines and human trace amine-associated receptors (hTAARs) in central nervous system | journal = Biomed.

Tryptamine is the common functional group in a set of compounds termed collectively ''[[substituted tryptamine]]s''. This set includes many [[Biological activity|biologically active]] [[Chemical compound|compound]]s, including [[neurotransmitter]]s and [[psychedelic drug]]s.

The concentration of tryptamine in rat brains is about 3.5 [[picomole|pmol]]/g.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.tox.2006.05.102 | title = Conversion of trichloroethylene to chloral using occupationally relevant levels | year = 2006 | last1 = Jiang | first1 = Zhen | last2 = Mutch | first2 = Elaine | last3 = Blain | first3 = Peter G. | last4 = Williams | first4 = Faith M. | journal = Toxicology | volume = 226 | pages = 76–77 | issue=1}}</ref>

==Plants containing tryptamine==
Many plants contain small amounts of tryptamine.  It is a feedstock for the metabolic pathways which influence plant growth and [[Microbiota|microbiome]].  For example, it is found as a possible intermediate in one [[metabolism|biosynthetic pathway]] to the plant hormone [[indole-3-acetic acid]].<ref name="plant">{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PQ2nWAPzPcIC&pg=RA3-PA43&lpg=RA3-PA43&dq=acacia+tryptamine+-gum#PRA3-PA43,M1  | author = Nobutaka Takahashi | title = Chemistry of Plant Hormones | publisher = [[CRC Press]] | isbn = 9780849354700 | year = 1986}}</ref> Higher concentrations can be found in many ''[[Acacia]]'' species.

==Pharmacology==
Tryptamine is an agonist of [[hTAAR1]].<ref name="Human trace amines and hTAARs October 2016 review" /> It acts as a non-selective [[serotonin receptor agonist]] and [[serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine releasing agent]] (SNDRA), with a preference for evoking [[serotonin]] and [[dopamine]] [[neurotransmitter release|release]] over [[norepinephrine]] release.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00165727 | title = Evidence for various tryptamines and related compounds acting as substrates of the platelet 5-hydroxytryptamine transporter | year = 1992 | last1 = Wölfel | first1 = Reinhard | last2 = Graefe | first2 = Karl-Heinz | journal = Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology | volume = 345 | issue = 2 | pages = 129–36 | pmid=1570019}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 15093948 | year = 2004 | last1 = Shimazu | first1 = S | last2 = Miklya | first2 = I | title = Pharmacological studies with endogenous enhancer substances: Beta-phenylethylamine, tryptamine, and their synthetic derivatives | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 421–7 | doi = 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2003.11.016 | journal = Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry}}</ref><ref name="BloughLandavazo2014">{{cite journal|last1=Blough|first1=Bruce E.|last2=Landavazo|first2=Antonio|last3=Partilla|first3=John S.|last4=Decker|first4=Ann M.|last5=Page|first5=Kevin M.|last6=Baumann|first6=Michael H.|last7=Rothman|first7=Richard B.|title=Alpha-ethyltryptamines as dual dopamine–serotonin releasers|journal=Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters|volume=24|issue=19|year=2014|pages=4754–4758|issn=0960-894X|doi=10.1016/j.bmcl.2014.07.062|pmid=25193229|pmc=4211607}}</ref>

Tryptamine has been shown to act as a noncompetitive inhibitor of [[serotonin N-acetyltransferase|serotonin ''N''-acetyltransferase]] (SNAT) in mosquitoes.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Khoo HG, Wong KP |title=Acetyl CoA generation and ''N''-acetylation of serotonin (5HT) in the mosquito, Aedes togoi |journal=Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=445–51 |year=1994 |pmid=7911372 |doi=10.1016/0965-1748(94)90039-6}}</ref> SNAT catalyzes the anabolic metabolism of serotonin into [[N-acetylserotonin|''N''-acetylserotonin]], another [[neuromodulator]] (specifically a neurotrophic factor via [[TrkB]] agonism) and the immediate precursor for [[melatonin]].

Tryptamine is rapidly metabolized by [[MAO-A]] and [[MAO-B]],<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0006-2952(86)90421-1 | title = The oxidation of tryptamine by the two forms of monoamine oxidase in human tissues | year = 1986 | last1 = Sullivan | first1 = James P. | last2 = McDonnell | first2 = Leonard | last3 = Hardiman | first3 = Orla M. | last4 = Farrell | first4 = Michael A. | last5 = Phillips | first5 = Jack P. | last6 = Tipton | first6 = Keith F. | journal = Biochemical Pharmacology | volume = 35 | issue = 19 | pages = 3255–60 | pmid = 3094536}}</ref> and for this reason, has a very short ''[[in vivo]]'' [[half-life]].
