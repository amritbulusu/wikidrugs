'''Tolperisone''', a [[piperidine]] derivative, is a centrally acting [[muscle relaxant]]. Trade names include '''Biocalm''', '''Muscodol''', '''Mydeton''', '''Mydocalm''', '''Mydoflex''', '''Myolax''', '''Myoxan''' and '''Viveo'''.

== Clinical use ==
Tolperisone is indicated for use in the treatment of pathologically increased tone of the [[Skeletal muscle|cross-striated muscle]] caused by neurological diseases (damage of the [[pyramidal tract]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[myelopathy]], [[encephalomyelitis]]) and of spastic paralysis and other encephalopathies manifested with muscular dystonia.<ref name="Austria-Codex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Jasek, W|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2007|edition=62nd|pages=5510–1|isbn=978-3-85200-181-4|language=German}}</ref><ref name="Midocalm-ro">{{ cite web | url = http://www.info-medic.ro/midocalm/ | title = Midocalm | publisher = InfoMedic| location = Romania}}</ref>

*Spondylarthrosis
*Cervical and lumbar syndromes
*[[Arthrosis]] of the large joints
*[[atherosclerosis|Obliterating atherosclerosis]] of the extremity vessels
*[[Diabetic angiopathy]]
*[[Thromboangiitis obliterans]]
*[[Raynaud's syndrome]]

== Contraindications and cautions ==
Manufacturers report that tolperisone should not be used in patients with [[myasthenia gravis]]. Only limited data are available regarding the safety in children, youths, during pregnancy and breastfeeding. It is not known whether tolperisone is excreted into mother's milk.<ref name="Austria-Codex" /><ref name="Midocalm-ro" />

== Side effects  ==
Adverse effects occur in fewer than 1% of patients and include muscle weakness, headache, arterial [[hypotension]], nausea, vomiting, [[dyspepsia]], and dry mouth. All effects are reversible.<ref name="Austria-Codex" /><ref name="Midocalm-ro" />
Allergic reactions occur in fewer than 0.1% of patient and include skin rash, [[hives]], [[Quincke's edema]], and in some cases [[anaphylactic shock]].<ref name="Austria-Codex" /><ref>{{ cite journal |vauthors=Ribi C, Vermeulen C, Hauser C | title = Anaphylactic reactions to tolperisone (Mydocalm) | journal = Swiss Medical Weekly | volume = 133 | issue = 25–26 | pages = 369–371 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12947534 }}</ref><ref name="pmid14587432">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kwaśniewski A, Korbuszewska-Gontarz B, Mika S |title=[Mydocalm causing anaphylaxis] |language=Polish |journal=Pneumonologia i Alergologia Polska |volume=71 |issue=5–6 |pages=250–2 |year=2003 |pmid=14587432 |doi= |url= }}</ref><ref name="pmid21905508">{{cite journal |vauthors=Glück J, Rymarczyk B, Rogala B |title=An immediate hypersensitivity reaction caused by tolperisone hydrochloride |journal=J Investig Allergol Clin Immunol |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=411–2 |year=2011 |pmid=21905508 |doi= |url= }}</ref>

== Overdose ==
Excitability has been noted after ingestion of high doses by children.<ref name="Austria-Codex" />
In suicide studies of three isolated cases, it is believed that ingestion of tolperisone was the cause of death.<ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Sporkert, F. |author2=Brunel, C. |author3=Augsburger, M.

== Interactions ==
Tolperisone does not have a significant potential for interactions with other pharmaceutical drugs. It cannot be excluded that combination with other centrally acting muscle relaxants, [[benzodiazepine]]s or [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs) may make a dose reduction necessary in some patients.<ref name="Austria-Codex" /><ref name="Midocalm-ro" />

== Mechanism of action ==
Tolperisone is a centrally acting muscle relaxant that acts at the [[reticular formation]] in the brain stem<ref name="Austria-Codex" /> by blocking [[Voltage-gated sodium channel|voltage-gated sodium]] and [[Voltage-gated calcium channel|calcium channels]].<ref>{{ cite journal |vauthors=Kocsis P, Farkas S, Fodor L, Bielik N, Thán M, Kolok S, Gere A, Csejtei M, Tarnawa I | title = Tolperisone-type drugs inhibit spinal reflexes via blockade of voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels | journal = Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 315 | issue = 3 | pages = 1237–1246 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16126840 | doi = 10.1124/jpet.105.089805 }}</ref><ref>{{ cite journal |vauthors=Hofer D, Lohberger B, Steinecker B, Schmidt K, Quasthoff S, Schreibmayer W | title = A comparative study of the action of tolperisone on seven different voltage dependent sodium channel isoforms | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 538 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 5–14 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16650844 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2006.03.034 }}</ref>

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Tolperisone is absorbed nearly completely from the gut and reaches its [[peak (pharmacology)|peak]] blood plasma concentration after 1.5 hours. It is extensively metabolised in the liver and kidneys. The substance is excreted via the kidneys in two phases; the first with a half-life of two hours, and the second with a half-life of 12 hours.<ref name="Austria-Codex" />
