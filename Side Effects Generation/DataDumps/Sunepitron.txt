==Synthesis==
[[File:Sunepitron synthesis.svg|thumb|center|700px|Sunepitron synthesis: G.N. Bright, K.A. Desai, {{US Patent|5,122,525}} (1992).]]
The synthesis starts by conversion of the pyridine dicarboxylic acid ('''1''') to its acid chloride; rxn with MeOH then affords the ester ('''2'''). [[Catalytic hydrogenation]] serves to reduce the pyridine ring to a piperidine of undefined stereochemistry ('''3'''). Alkylation of this intermediate with chloroacetonitrile affords ('''4'''). Treatment of that intermediate with [[Raney nickel]] reduces the cyano group to the corresponding primary amine; this product then undergoes an internal ester-amine interchange to yield the cyclized [[lactam]] ('''5'''). LAH serves to reduce the lactam to an amine; the ester on the other ring is reduced to a carbinol in the process, affording the aminoalcohol ('''7'''). The basic function is next alkylated with 2-chloropyrimidine ('''7'''). Rxn of the alcoholin ('''8''') with MsCl leads to the mesylate; that group is next displaced by [[sodium azide]] ('''9'''); the azide group is next reduced to the primary amine. Resolution of this product as its [[mandelate]] salt then yields ('''10''') as a single enantiomer. Rxn of that product with [[succinic anhydride]] converts the pendant amine to a succinimide, affording the anxiolytic agent '''sunepitron''' ('''1''').
