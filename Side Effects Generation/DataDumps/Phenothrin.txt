}}</ref> is a synthetic [[pyrethroid]] that kills adult [[flea]]s and [[tick]]s. It has also been used to kill [[head lice]] in humans. d-Phenothrin is used as a component of aerosol insecticides for domestic use. Phenothrin is often used with [[methoprene]], an insect growth regulator that interrupts the insect's [[biological life cycle]] by killing the eggs. Phenothrin is the active agent in the branded product [[Raid (insecticide)|Raid]] Fly & Wasp Killer.

== Effects ==
Phenothrin is primarily used to kill fleas and ticks.<ref name= A>JOURNAL OF PESTICIDE REFORM/ SUMMER 2003 • VOL. 23, NO. 2 http://www.pesticide.org/get-the-facts/pesticide-factsheets/factsheets/sumithrin</ref> It is also used to kill [[head lice]] in humans, but studies conducted in Paris, France and the United Kingdom have shown widespread resistance to phenothrin.<ref name= A />

It is extremely toxic to bees. An [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) study found that 0.07 micrograms was enough to kill [[honey bee]]s.<ref name= A /> It is also extremely toxic to aquatic life with a study showing concentrations of 0.03 [[Parts per billion|ppb]] killing mysid shrimp.<ref name= A/> It has increased risk of liver cancer in rats and mice in long term exposure.<ref name= A/>  It is capable of killing [[mosquitoes]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Permethrin, Resmethrin, d-Phenothrin (Sumithrin®): Synthetic Pyrethroids For Mosquito Control|url=https://www.epa.gov/mosquitocontrol/permethrin-resmethrin-d-phenothrin-sumithrinr-synthetic-pyrethroids-mosquito-control|website=US EPA|language=en}}</ref> although remains poisonous to cats and dogs, with seizures and deaths being reported due to poisoning.<ref name= A/> Specific data on concentrations or exposure is lacking.

Phenothrin has been found to possess [[antiandrogen]] properties, and was responsible for a small epidemic of [[gynecomastia]] via isolated environmental exposure.<ref name="BarrosSampaio2012">{{cite journal|last1=Barros|first1=Alfredo Carlos Simões Dornellas de|last2=Sampaio|first2=Marcelo de Castro Moura|title=Gynecomastia: physiopathology, evaluation and treatment|journal=Sao Paulo Medical Journal|volume=130|issue=3|year=2012|pages=187–197|issn=1516-3180|doi=10.1590/S1516-31802012000300009|quote=Reinforcing the evidence suggesting that there is a relationship between chemicals and GM, it is worthwhile mentioning the epidemic onset observed among Haitian refugees in 1981 about four months after arrival in United States detention centers.22 After analyzing all identifiable environmental exposures, it was then found that phenothrin, a multi-insecticide contained in sprays that they had used was the causative agent.23 It is now widely known that phenothrin has antiandrogenic activity.|pmid=22790552}}</ref><ref name="Brody, MD, PhD, FACELoriaux, MD2003">{{cite journal|last1=Brody, MD, PhD, FACE|first1=Steven A.|last2=Loriaux, MD|first2=D.

The EPA has not assessed its effect on cancer in humans. However, one study performed by the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine links sumithrin with [[breast cancer]]; the link made by sumithrin's effect on increasing the expression of a gene responsible for [[mammary]] tissue proliferation.<ref name= A/>

== EPA action ==
In 2005, the U.S. EPA canceled permission to use phenothrin in several flea and tick products, at the request of the manufacturer, [[Hartz Mountain Industries]].<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA-PEST/2005/November/Day-04/p22039.htm Phenothrin and s-Methoprene; Product Cancellation Order], US Environmental Protection Agency{{dead link|date=January 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA-PEST/2005/November/Day-09/p22256.htm Phenothrin; Amendment to Terminate Use], US Environmental Protection Agency{{dead link|date=January 2015}}</ref> The products were linked to a range of adverse reactions, including hair loss, salivation, [[tremor]]s, and numerous deaths in cats and kittens. In the short term, the agreement called for new warning labels on the products.

As of March 31, 2006, the sale and distribution of Hartz's phenothrin-containing flea and tick products for cats has been terminated.  However, EPA's product cancellation order did not apply to Hartz flea and tick products for dogs, and Hartz continues to produce many of its flea and tick products for dogs.<ref>[http://hartz.com/Hartz_Products/Dog_Products/Parasite_Protection/Topical_Drops/3270010874_hartz_ultraguard_pro.aspx] See also "dog" in the following EPA ruling: {{cite web |title=Insect Growth Regulators: S-Hydroprene (128966), S-Kinoprene (107502), Methoprene (105401), S-Methoprene (105402) Fact Sheet |publisher=[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] |url=http://www.epa.gov/oppbppd1/biopesticides/ingredients/factsheets/factsheet_igr.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624071746/http://www.epa.gov/oppbppd1/biopesticides/ingredients/factsheets/factsheet_igr.htm |archivedate=2009-06-24 |df= }}</ref>
