'''Ivabradine''', marketed under the trade name '''Corlanor''' among others,<ref name=Am2015/> is a [[medication]] used for the symptomatic management of stable [[angina pectoris|heart-related chest pain]] and [[heart failure]] not fully managed by [[beta blockers]].<ref name=Van2016>{{cite journal|last1=Yancy|first1=CW|last2=Jessup|first2=M|last3=Bozkurt|first3=B|last4=Butler|first4=J|last5=Casey DE|first5=Jr|last6=Colvin|first6=MM|last7=Drazner|first7=MH|last8=Filippatos|first8=G|last9=Fonarow|first9=GC|last10=Givertz|first10=MM|last11=Hollenberg|first11=SM|last12=Lindenfeld|first12=J|last13=Masoudi|first13=FA|last14=McBride|first14=PE|last15=Peterson|first15=PN|last16=Stevenson|first16=LW|last17=Westlake|first17=C|title=2016 ACC/AHA/HFSA Focused Update on New Pharmacological Therapy for Heart Failure: An Update of the 2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines and the Heart Failure Society of America.|journal=Circulation|date=20 May 2016|pmid=27208050|doi=10.1161/CIR.0000000000000435|volume=134|pages=e282–e293}}</ref>

Ivabradine acts by reducing the [[heart rate]] via specific inhibition of the [[funny channel]], a mechanism different from that of [[beta blocker]]s and [[calcium channel blocker]]s, two commonly prescribed [[antianginal]] drugs. Ivabradine is a cardiotonic agent.

==Medical uses==
It is used for the symptomatic treatment of chronic stable [[angina pectoris]] in patients with normal [[sinus rhythm]] who cannot take [[beta blockers]]. It is also being used off-label in the treatment of [[inappropriate sinus tachycardia]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yusuf S, Camm AJ |title=Sinus tachyarrhythmias and the specific bradycardic agents: a marriage made in heaven? |journal=J.

===Chest pain===
It may be as effective as the beta blocker [[atenolol]]<ref name=Tardif>{{cite journal |vauthors=Tardif JC, Ford I, Tendera M, Bourassa MG, Fox K |title=Efficacy of ivabradine, a new selective I(f) inhibitor, compared with atenolol in patients with chronic stable angina |journal=Eur.

===Heart failure===
It is used in combination with beta blockers in people with [[heart failure]] with LVEF lower than 35 percent inadequately controlled by beta blockers alone and whose heart rate exceeds 70 beats per minute.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McMurray|first1=JJ|last2=Adamopoulos|first2=S|last3=Anker|first3=SD|last4=Auricchio|first4=A|last5=Böhm|first5=M|last6=Dickstein|first6=K|last7=Falk|first7=V|last8=Filippatos|first8=G|last9=Fonseca|first9=C|last10=Gomez-Sanchez|first10=MA|last11=Jaarsma|first11=T|last12=Køber|first12=L|last13=Lip|first13=GY|last14=Maggioni|first14=AP|last15=Parkhomenko|first15=A|last16=Pieske|first16=BM|last17=Popescu|first17=BA|last18=Rønnevik|first18=PK|last19=Rutten|first19=FH|last20=Schwitter|first20=J|last21=Seferovic|first21=P|last22=Stepinska|first22=J|last23=Trindade|first23=PT|last24=Voors|first24=AA|last25=Zannad|first25=F|last26=Zeiher|first26=A|last27=ESC Committee for Practice|first27=Guidelines|title=ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure 2012: The Task Force for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Acute and Chronic Heart Failure 2012 of the European Society of Cardiology.

==Contraindications==
Ivabradine is contraindicated in [[sick sinus syndrome]]. It should also not be used concomitantly with potent inhibitors of [[CYP3A4]], including [[antifungal drug|azole antifungals]] (such as [[ketoconazole]]), [[macrolide]] antibiotics, [[nefazodone]] and the antiretroviral drugs [[nelfinavir]] and [[ritonavir]].<ref name=EMEA112>{{cite web |url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Product_Information/human/000597/WC500043590.pdf|title=European Medicine Agency, Procoralan Summary of Product Characteristics |accessdate=2010-09-13 |format= |work=}}</ref>

Use of ivabradine with [[verapamil]] or [[diltiazem]] is contraindicated.<ref>{{cite news|title=Press release: European Medicines Agency recommends measures to reduce risk of heart problems with Corlentor/Procoralan (ivabradine)|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/news_and_events/news/2014/11/news_detail_002217.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058004d5c1#press-release|work=European Medicines Agency|date=21 November 2014|language=en}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Overall, 14.5% of patients taking ivabradine experience [[phosphene|luminous phenomena]] (by patients described as sensations of enhanced brightness in a fully maintained visual field). This is probably due to blockage of I<sub>''h''</sub> ion channels in the [[retina]], which are very similar to cardiac I<sub>''f''</sub>. These symptoms are mild, transient, and fully reversible. In clinical studies, about 1% of all patients had to discontinue the drug because of these sensations, which occurred on average 40 days after the drug was started.<ref name=Tardif/>

In a large clinical trial, [[bradycardia]] (unusually slow heart rate) occurred in 2% and 5% of patients taking ivabradine at doses of 7.5 and 10&nbsp;mg respectively (compared to 4.3% in those taking atenolol).<ref name=Tardif/> 2.6–4.8% reported [[headache]]s.<ref name=Tardif/> Other common [[adverse drug reaction]]s (1–10% of patients) include first-degree [[heart block|AV block]], [[Premature ventricular contraction|ventricular extrasystoles]], dizziness and/or blurred vision.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Anonymous | title = New medicines: Procoralan | url = http://www.pjonline.com/Editorial/20060204/products/p131products.html | journal = Pharmaceutical Journal | year = 2006 | volume = 276 | issue = 7386 | pages=131 }}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Ivabradine acts on the I<sub>''f''</sub> (''f'' is for "[[Funny current|funny]]", so called because it had unusual properties compared with other current systems known at the time of its discovery) ion current, which is highly expressed in the [[sinoatrial node]]. I<sub>''f''</sub> is a mixed Na<sup>+</sup>–K<sup>+</sup> inward current activated by hyperpolarization and modulated by the autonomic nervous system. It is one of the most important ionic currents for regulating pacemaker activity in the sinoatrial (SA) node. Ivabradine selectively inhibits the pacemaker I<sub>''f''</sub> current in a dose-dependent manner. Blocking this channel reduces [[cardiac pacemaker]] activity, selectively slowing the heart rate and allowing more time for blood to flow to the myocardium.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Thollon C, Cambarrat C, Vian J, Prost JF, Peglion JL, Vilaine JP |title=Electrophysiological effects of S 16257, a novel sino-atrial node modulator, on rabbit and guinea-pig cardiac preparations: comparison with UL-FS 49 |journal=Br. J. Pharmacol. |volume=112 |issue=1 |pages=37–42 |year=1994 |pmid=8032660 |doi= 10.1111/j.1476-5381.1994.tb13025.x|pmc=1910295}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sulfi S, Timmis AD |title=Ivabradine – the first selective sinus node If channel inhibitor in the treatment of stable angina |journal=Int. J. Clin. Pract. |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=222–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16451297|doi=10.1111/j.1742-1241.2006.00817.x |pmc=1448693}}</ref> This is in contrast to other commonly used rate-reducing medications, such as beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers, which not only reduce heart rate, but also the cardiac contractility. Given the selective decrease in rate without loss of contractility, ivabradine may prove efficacious for treatment of congestive heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

==Clinical trials==

===Coronary artery disease===
The BEAUTIFUL study randomised over 10917 patients having stable coronary artery disease and left ventricle dysfunction (ejection fraction < 40%). Ivabradine did not show a significant reduction in the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, admission to hospital for acute myocardial infarction, and admission to hospital for new onset or worsening heart failure. However, in a prespecified subgroup of patients with a heart rate of more than 70 bpm, ivabradine significantly reduced the following secondary endpoints:<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Kim Fox |author2=Ian Ford |author3=P Gabriel Steg |author4=Michal Tendera |author5=Prof Roberto Ferrari | title = Ivabradine for patients with stable coronary artery disease and left-ventricular systolic dysfunction: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial | url = http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673608611708/abstract | journal = The Lancet | year = 2008 | issue = 9641 | pages = 807–816 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61170-8 | volume = 372 | pmid=18757088}}</ref>
* Coronary events by 22% (P=0.023)
* Fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction by 36% (P=0.001)
* Coronary revascularization by 30% (P=0.016).

The SIGNIFY trial randomized 19,102 patients with coronary artery disease and a heart rate greater than 70, but without clinical heart failure to ivabradine or placebo in addition to standard therapy. Ivabradine did not improve outcomes in this patient group.<ref>http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1406430</ref>

===Chronic heart failure===
In the SHIFT study, ivabradine significantly reduced the risk of the primary composite endpoint of hospitalization for worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death by 18% (P<0.0001) compared with placebo on top of optimal therapy.<ref name="Stiles">{{cite web|last=Stiles|first=Steve|title=SHIFT: Adding HR-slowing agent ivabradine to HF meds cuts mortality, hospitalization|url=http://www.theheart.org/article/1113617.do|publisher=TheHeart.org|accessdate=1 April 2011}}</ref> These benefits were observed after 3 months of treatment.
SHIFT also showed that administration of ivabradine to heart failure patients significantly reduced the risk of death from heart failure by 26% (P=0.014) and hospitalization for heart failure by 26% (P<0.0001).
The improvements in outcomes were observed throughout all prespecified subgroups: female and male, with or without beta-blockers at randomization, patients below and over 65 years of age, with heart failure of ischemic or non-ischemic etiology, NYHA class II or class III, IV, with or without diabetes, and with or without hypertension.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Swedberg K, Komajda M, Böhm M, Borer JS, Ford I, Dubost-Brama A, Lerebours G, Tavazzi L; on behalf of the SHIFT Investigators | title = Ivabradine and outcomes in chronic heart failure (SHIFT): a randomised placebo-controlled study| url = http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(10)61198-1/abstract | journal = The Lancet | year = 2010 | issue = 9744 | pages = 875–885 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61198-1 | volume = 376 | pmid=20801500}}</ref>
