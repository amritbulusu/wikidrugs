'''25D-NBOMe''' (or '''NBOMe-2C-D''') is a derivative of the [[phenethylamine]] derived hallucinogen [[2C-D]]. It acts in a similar manner to related compounds such as [[25I-NBOMe]], which is a potent [[agonist]] at the [[5HT2A receptor|5HT<sub>2A</sub>]] [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Hansen | first1 = M. | last2 = Phonekeo | first2 = K. | last3 = Paine | first3 = J.

==Legality==

===China===
As of October 2015 25D-NBOMe is a controlled substance in China.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sfda.gov.cn/WS01/CL0056/130753.html | title=关于印发《非药用类麻醉药品和精神药品列管办法》的通知 | publisher=China Food and Drug Administration | date=27 September 2015 | language=Chinese | accessdate=1 October 2015}}</ref>

===Sweden===
[[Riksdag|''Sveriges riksdag'']] added 25D-NBOMe to schedule I (''"substances, plant materials and fungi which normally do not have medical use"'') as narcotics in Sweden as of Aug 1, 2013,  published by [[Medical Products Agency (Sweden)|''Medical Products Agency'']] in their regulation '''LVFS 2013:15''' listed as '''25D-NBOMe 2-(2,5-dimetoxi-4-metylfenyl)-N-(2-metoxibensyl)etanamin'''.<ref>https://lakemedelsverket.se/upload/lvfs/LVFS_2013-15.pdf</ref>

===United Kingdom===
{{N-benzylphenethylamine-Legality-United Kingdom}}

===United States===
Unregulated at a federal and state level, though arguably may contravene the [[Federal Analog Act]] under certain circumstances given its structural and functional similarity to controlled substance 2C-D.
