'''Tranilast''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], brand name '''Rizaben''') is an antiallergic drug. It was developed by Kissei Pharmaceuticals and was approved in 1982 for use in Japan and South Korea for [[bronchial asthma]]. Indications for [[keloid scar|keloid]] and [[hypertrophic scar]] were added in 1993.<ref>http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/press-release-nuon-therapeutics-completes-agreement-tranilast-kissei-pharmaceutical/2007-07-23</ref> 
It has been used for the treatment of allergic disorders such as [[asthma]], [[allergic rhinitis]] and [[atopic dermatitis]].

In-vitro it reduces collagen synthesis in [[fibroblasts]],<ref>http://jb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/116/4/892</ref> and inhibits growth of [[neurofibroma]] cells.<ref>http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/tjem/217/3/217_193/_article "Tranilast, an Anti-Allergic Drug, Down-Regulates the Growth of Cultured Neurofibroma Cells Derived from Neurofibromatosis Type 1" 2009</ref>

In-vitro it inhibits the production of [[interleukin-6]] in [[endothelial cell]]s.<ref>http://molpharm.aspetjournals.org/content/62/4/856.full "Tranilast Inhibits Cytokine-Induced Nuclear Factor ÎºB Activation in Vascular Endothelial Cells" 2002</ref>

It is relatively safe and well tolerated by most patients at doses of up to 600&nbsp;mg/day for months. 

After promising results in three small trial Tranilast was studied in a major clinical trial (the [[PRESTO trial]]) for prevention of [[restenosis]] after [[Percutaneous coronary intervention|percutaneous transluminal coronary revascularization]], but was not found effective for that application.<ref>http://www.circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/106/10/1243 "Results of Prevention of REStenosis with Tranilast and its Outcomes (PRESTO) Trial" 2002</ref>

It has also been investigated for use as an [[antiproliferative]] drug on [[drug-eluting stent]]s.

A phase II trial is recruiting [[rheumatoid arthritis]] patients.<ref>http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00882024</ref>

A phase III trial is evaluating tranilast for [[Pterygium]].<ref>http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01003613</ref>
