* Conditions worsened by an increase in blood pressure or heart rate, such as [[angina]], [[stroke]], poorly controlled [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], ''etc.'' as ketamine increases both heart rate and blood pressure. 
* Psychiatric disorders. Ketamine can cause hallucinations, so it can exacerbate the symptoms of certain psychiatric disorders. 
* Raised [[intracranial pressure]] (ICP). Ketamine can further increase ICP. 
* Raised [[intraocular pressure]] (IOP). Ketamine can also increase IOP.
* Penetrating eye injury. Can increase risk of loss of eye contents, due to increased IOP. 
* [[Acute porphyria]]. Ketamine is considered porphyrinogenic, that is, it may provoke an attack of acute porphyria in susceptible persons.

At anesthetic doses, 10-20% of people experience adverse reactions that occur during emergence from anesthesia, reactions that can manifest as seriously as hallucinations and delirium.<ref name="StrayerNelson2008" /> These reactions may be less common in some people subpopulations, and when administered intramuscularly, and can occur up to 24&nbsp;hours postoperatively; the chance of this occurring can be reduced by minimizing stimulation to the person during recovery and pretreating with a [[benzodiazepine]], alongside a lower dose of ketamine.<ref name="StrayerNelson2008" /> People who experience severe reactions may require treatment with a small dose of a short- or ultrashort-acting [[barbiturate]].<ref name="MerckManual" />

===Neurological effects===

However, the rat brain has significant differences in metabolism from the human brain, therefore such changes may not occur in humans.<ref name="NeurologicalEffects">Neurological effects of ketamine introduction references:

The first large-scale, longitudinal study of ketamine users found current frequent (averaging 20&nbsp;days/month) ketamine users had increased depression and impaired memory by several measures, including verbal, short-term memory, and visual memory. Current infrequent (averaging 3.25&nbsp;days/month) ketamine users and former ketamine users were not found to differ from controls in memory, attention, and psychological well-being tests. This suggests the infrequent use of ketamine does not cause cognitive deficits, and that any deficits that might occur may be reversible when ketamine use is discontinued. However, abstinent, frequent, and infrequent users all scored higher than controls on a test of delusional symptoms.<ref name="Morgan2009">{{Cite journal |doi= 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02761.x |pmid= 19919593 |title= Consequences of chronic ketamine self-administration upon neurocognitive function and psychological wellbeing: A 1-year longitudinal study |year= 2009 |last1= Morgan |first1= CJA |last2= Muetzelfeldt |first2= L |last3= Curran |first3= HV |journal= [[Addiction (journal)|Addiction]] |volume= 105 |issue= 1 |pages= 121–33}}</ref>

Short-term exposure of cultures of [[GABAergic]] [[neuron]]s to ketamine at high concentrations led to a significant loss of differentiated cells in one study, and noncell-death-inducing concentrations of ketamine (10 μg/ml) may still initiate long-term alterations of dendritic arbor in differentiated neurons. The same study also demonstrated chronic (>24 h) administration of ketamine at concentrations as low as 0.01 μg/ml can interfere with the maintenance of dendritic arbor architecture. These results raise the possibility that chronic exposure to low, subanesthetic concentrations of ketamine, while not affecting cell survival, could still impair neuronal maintenance and development.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid= 17418473 |doi= 10.1016/j.tox.2007.03.004 |volume= 234 |issue= 3 |title= Low concentrations of ketamine initiate dendritic atrophy of differentiated GABAergic neurons in culture |date= May 2007 |journal= [[Toxicology (journal)|Toxicology]] |pages= 216–26 |last1= Vutskits |first1= L |last2= Gascon |first2= E |last3= Potter |first3= G |last4= Tassonyi |first4= E |last5= Kiss |first5= JZ |displayauthors= 4}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hargreaves|first1=RJ|last2=Hill|first2=RG|last3=Iversen|first3=LL|title=Neuroprotective NMDA antagonists: the controversy over their potential for adverse effects on cortical neuronal morphology |journal=Acta Neurochirurgica Supplementum|date=1994|volume=60|pages=15–9|pmid=7976530|doi=10.1007/978-3-7091-9334-1_4}}</ref>

===Urinary tract effects===
A 2011 systematic review examined 110 reports of irritative urinary tract symptoms from ketamine recreational use.<ref name="Middela2011">{{cite journal |last1= Middela |first1= S |last2= Pearce |first2= I |title= Ketamine-induced vesicopathy: A literature review |journal= International Journal of Clinical Practice |date= January 2011 |volume= 65 |issue= 1 |pages= 27–30 |doi= 10.1111/j.1742-1241.2010.02502.x |pmid= 21155941}}</ref> Urinary tract symptoms have been collectively referred as "ketamine-induced ulcerative cystitis" or "ketamine-induced vesicopathy", and they include urge [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]], decreased [[bladder]] compliance, decreased bladder volume, [[detrusor]] overactivity, and painful [[hematuria|blood in urine]]. [[Hydronephrosis|Bilateral hydronephrosis]] and [[renal papillary necrosis]] have also been reported in some cases.<ref name="Middela2011" /><ref name=morgan11>{{cite journal |last1= Morgan |first1= CJA |last2= Curran |first2= HV |last3= Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs (ISCD) |title= Ketamine use: A review |journal= [[Addiction (journal)|Addiction]] |date= January 2012 |volume= 107 |issue= 1 |pages= 27–38 |doi= 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2011.03576.x |pmid= 21777321}}</ref> The [[pathogenesis]] of papillary necrosis has been investigated in mice, and mononuclear [[inflammation|inflammatory]] infiltration in the renal papilla resulting from ketamine dependence has been suggested as a possible mechanism.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Yeung |first= LY |last2= Rudd |first2= JA |last3= Lam |first3= WP |last4= Mak |first4= YT |last5= Yew |first5= DT |displayauthors= 4 |title= Mice are prone to kidney pathology after prolonged ketamine addiction |journal= [[Toxicology Letters]] |date= December 2009 |volume= 191 |issue= 2–3 |pages= 275–8 |pmid= 19766175 |doi= 10.1016/j.toxlet.2009.09.006}}</ref>

The time of onset of lower urinary tract symptoms varies depending, in part, on the severity and chronicity of ketamine use; however, it is unclear whether the severity and chronicity of ketamine use corresponds linearly to the presentation of these symptoms. All reported cases where the user consumed greater than 5&nbsp;g/day reported symptoms of the lower urinary tract.<ref name="Middela2011" /> Urinary tract symptoms appear to be most common in daily ketamine users who have used the drug recreationally for an extended period of time.<ref name="morgan11" /> These symptoms have presented in only one case of medical use of ketamine. However, following dose reduction, the symptoms remitted.<ref name="morgan11" />

Management of these symptoms primarily involves ketamine cessation, for which compliance is low. Other treatments have been used, including [[antibiotics]], [[NSAID]]s, [[steroid]]s, [[anticholinergic]]s, and cystodistension.<ref name="Middela2011" /> Both [[hyaluronic acid]] instillation and combined [[pentosan polysulfate]] and ketamine cessation have been shown to provide relief in some people, but in the latter case, it is unclear whether relief resulted from ketamine cessation, administration of pentosan polysulfate, or both. Further follow-up is required to fully assess the efficacy of these treatments.<ref name="Middela2011" />

===Liver problems===
In case reports of three people treated with [[esketamine]] for relief of chronic pain, liver enzyme abnormalities occurred following repeat treatment with ketamine infusions, with the liver enzyme values returning below the upper reference limit of normal range on cessation of the drug. The result suggests liver enzymes must be monitored during such treatment.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bell|first1=RF|title=Ketamine for chronic noncancer pain: concerns regarding toxicity|journal=Current Opinion in Supportive and Palliative Care|date=June 2012|volume=6|issue=2|pages=183–7|pmid=22436323|doi=10.1097/SPC.0b013e328352812c}}</ref>

==Interactions==
Plasma concentrations of ketamine are increased by [[CYP3A4#CYP3A4 ligands|CYP3A4 inhibitor]]s (e.g., [[diazepam]]) and [[CYP2B6#CYP2B6 ligands|CYP2B6 inhibitor]]s (e.g., [[orphenadrine]]) due to inhibition of its metabolism.<ref name="Quibell2011" /><ref name="pmid28858450">{{cite journal | vauthors = Andrade C | title = Ketamine for Depression, 5: Potential Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Drug Interactions | journal = J Clin Psychiatry | volume = 78 | issue = 7 | pages = e858–e861 | year = 2017 | pmid = 28858450 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.17f11802 | url = }}</ref> CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 inducers like [[carbamazepine]], [[phenobarbital]], [[phenytoin]], and [[rifampicin]] may reduce plasma levels of ketamine.<ref name="pmid28858450" />

Other drugs which increase blood pressure may interact with ketamine in having an additive effect on blood pressure including: stimulants, SNRI antidepressants, and MAOIs. Increase blood pressure and heart rate, palpitations, and arrhythmias may be potential effects.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Ketamine is absorbable by [[intravenous]], [[intramuscular]], [[oral administration|oral]], and [[topical]] routes due to both its water and lipid solubilities.<ref name=aroni /> When administered orally, it undergoes [[first-pass metabolism]], where it is [[Biotransformation|biotransformed]] in the liver by [[CYP3A4]] (major), [[CYP2B6]] (minor), and [[CYP2C9]] (minor) isoenzymes into [[norketamine]] (through N-demethylation) and finally [[dehydronorketamine]].<ref name=sinner /> Intermediate in the biotransformation of norketamine into dehydronorketamine is the [[hydroxylation]] of norketamine into [[hydroxynorketamine]] by CYP2B6 and [[CYP2A6]].

Ketamine can be started using the [[oral administration|oral route]], or people may be changed from a [[Hypodermoclysis|subcutaneous infusion]] once pain is controlled.

* Oral ketamine is easily broken down by [[bile|bile acids]], thus has a low bioavailability. Often, lozenges or "gummies" for [[Sublingual administration|sublingual]] or [[Buccal administration|buccal]] absorption prepared by a compounding pharmacy are used to combat this issue.
* Some specialists stop the subcutaneous infusion when the first dose of oral ketamine is given. Others gradually reduce the infusion dose as the oral dose is increased.<ref>{{cite web |title= Ketamine in Palliative Care |url= http://www.palliativecareguidelines.scot.nhs.uk/documents/Ketaminefinal.pdf |date= August 2013 |origyear= August 2010 |work= Palliative Care Guidelines |publisher= [[NHS Lothian]], NHS Scotland, [[Health and Social Care Directorates]], Scotland |location= Edinburgh |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131029203516/http://www.palliativecareguidelines.scot.nhs.uk/documents/Ketaminefinal.pdf |archivedate= 2013-10-29 |deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Chemistry==

===Structure===
In chemical structure, ketamine is an [[arylcyclohexylamine]] derivative. Ketamine is a [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] compound. Most pharmaceutical preparations of ketamine are [[racemic]]; however, some brands reportedly have (mostly undocumented) differences in their [[enantiomer]]ic proportions. The more active enantiomer, [[esketamine]] (''S''-ketamine), is also available for medical use under the brand name Ketanest S,<ref name="Kruger1998">{{cite journal |last= Krüger |first= AD |title= Current aspects of using ketamine in childhood |language= DE |journal= Anaesthesiologie und Reanimation |volume= 23 |issue= 3 |pages= 64–71 |year= 1998 |pmid= 9707751 |doi= |url=}}</ref> while the less active enantiomer, [[arketamine]] (''R''-ketamine), has never been marketed as an [[enantiopure drug]] for clinical use.

The [[optical rotation]] of a given enantiomer of ketamine can vary between its [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] and [[free base]] form. The free base form of (''S'')‑ketamine exhibits [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|dextrorotation]] and is therefore labelled (''S'')‑(+)‑ketamine. However, its [[hydrochloride]] salt shows [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|levorotation]] and is thus labelled (''S'')‑(−)‑ketamine hydrochloride. The difference originates from the [[Cyclohexane conformation|conformation of the cyclohexanone ring]]. In both the free base and the hydrochloride, the cyclohexanone ring adopts a [[Cyclohexane conformation#Chair conformation|chair conformation]], but the orientation of the substituents varies. In the free base, the ''o''-chlorophenyl group adopts an equatorial position and the methylamino group adopts an axial position.<ref>{{cite journal|last2=Burjanadze|first2=N|last3=Breitkreutz|first3=J|last4=Bergander|first4=K|last5=Bergenthal|first5=D|last6=Kataeva|first6=O|last7=Fröhlich|first7=R|last8=Luftmann|first8=H|last9=Blaschke|first9=G|year=2002|title=Mechanistic study on the opposite migration order of the enantiomers of ketamine with α- and β-cyclodextrin in capillary electrophoresis|url=|journal=Journal of Separation Science|volume=25|pages=1155–1166|doi=10.1002/1615-9314(20021101)25:15/17<1155::AID-JSSC1155>3.0.CO;2-M|via=|first1=Bezhan|last1=C}}</ref> In the hydrochloride salt, the positions are reversed, with the ''o''-chlorophenyl group axial and the methylamino group equatorial.<ref>{{ cite journal | first1 = P | last1 = Hakey | first2 = W | last2 = Ouellette | first3 = J | last3 = Zubieta | first4 = T | last4 = Korter | title = (''S'')-(+)-Ketamine hydrochloride | journal = [[Acta Crystallographica E]] | year = 2008 | volume = 64 | page = o1487 | doi = 10.1107/S1600536808021053 }}</ref> Not all salts of ketamine show different optical rotation to the free base: (''S'')-ketamine (''R'',''R'')-[[tartrate]] is levorotatory, like (''S'')‑ketamine.<ref>{{ cite journal | first1 = E | last1 = Ratti-Mobery | first2 = P | last2 = Groth | first3 = AJ | last3 = Aasen | title = The Absolute Configuration of Ketamine – A General Anaesthetic.
