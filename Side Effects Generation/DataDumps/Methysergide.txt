'''Methysergide''' ('''1-[[methyl]]-''D''-[[lysergic acid]] [[butanol]][[amide]]''' or '''UML-491)''' also known as METHYSERGIDE MALEATE''',''' is an [[ergot]] derived prescription drug used for the [[prophylaxis]] of difficult to treat [[migraine]] and [[cluster headaches]]. 

Methysergide is no longer recommended as a first line treatment protocol by international headache societies, hospitals, and neurologists in private practice, for migraines or cluster headaches as side effects were first reported with long-term use in the late 1960's, and ergot based treatments fell out of favor for the treatment of migraines with the introduction of [[triptans]] in the 1980's. 

==Medical uses==
Methysergide is used exclusively to treat episodic and chronic [[migraine]] and for episodic and chronic [[Cluster headache|cluster headaches]].<ref name="tranquilene.com">http://tranquilene.com/methysergide.html</ref> Methysergide is one of the most effective <ref name=Tam>{{cite journal |vauthors=Joseph T, Tam SK, Kamat BR, Mangion JR |title=Successful repair of aortic and mitral incompetence induced by methylsergide maleate: confirmation by intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography |journal=Echocardiography |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=283–7 |year=2003|pmid=12848667 |doi=10.1046/j.1540-8175.2003.03027.x}}</ref> medications for the prevention of migraine, but is not intended for the treatment of an acute attack, it is to be taken daily as a preventative medication.

=== Efficacy ===
Methysergide has been as an effective treatment for migraine and cluster headache for over 50 years. A 2016 investigation by the [[European Medicines Agency]] due to long-held questions about safety concerns was performed. To assess the need for continuing availability of methysergide, the [[International Headache Society]] performed an electronic survey among their professional members.

The survey revealed that 71.3% of all respondents had ever prescribed methysergide and 79.8% would prescribe it if it were to become available. Respondents used it more in cluster headache than migraine, and reserved it for use in refractory patients. 

The European Medicines Agency concluded "that the vast majority of headache experts in this survey regarded methysergide a unique treatment option for specific populations for which there are no alternatives, with an urgent need to continue its availability." 

This position was supported by the International Headache Society. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=MacGregor|first=E.

==Side effects==
It has a known [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]], [[retroperitoneal fibrosis]]/retropulmonary fibrosis,<ref>[http://www.emedicine.com/radio/topic605.htm emedicine.com (2002)]</ref> which is severe, although uncommon.

==Pharmacology==
Methysergide interacts with [[5-HT receptor|serotonin (5-HT) receptors]]. Its [[therapeutic effect]] in migraine [[prophylaxis]] has been associated with its antagonism at the [[5-HT2B|5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor]].<ref name="pmid8743744">{{cite journal |vauthors=Schmuck K, Ullmer C, Kalkman HO, Probst A, Lubbert H |title=Activation of meningeal 5-HT2B receptors: an early step in the generation of migraine headache?|journal=Eur.

=== Dosing ===
Methysergide comes in 2mg and 4mg pills. Standard prophylaxis prescription for difficult to treat migraine and cluster is 4-8 mg PO qd. A drug holiday for 4 weeks every 6 months is now advised to reduce chance of retroperitoneal fibrosis/retropulmonary fibrosis.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OpeLBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA92&lpg=PA92&dq=sansert+drug+holiday&source=bl&ots=bfw-1VKhax&sig=qwSfyNneP3Hb3fwNP9IjGGZJWzQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj6koPX6JDWAhVETSYKHf0yDiQQ6AEINjAD#v=onepage&q=sansert%20drug%20holiday&f=false|title=Managing Your Headaches|last=Green|first=Mark|publisher=Springer|year=2001|isbn=9780387222516|location=|pages=92}}</ref> 

==History==
[[Harold Wolff|Harold Wolff's]] theory of [[vasodilation]] in migraine is well-known. Less known is his search for a perivascular factor that would damage local tissues and increase pain sensitivity during migraine attacks. Serotonin was found to be among the candidate agents to be included. 

In the same period, serotonin was isolated (1948) and, because of its actions, an anti-serotonin drug was needed. 

Methysergide was synthesized from lysergic acid ([[Lsd|LSD]]) by adding a methyl group and a butanolamid group. This resulted in a compound with selectivity and high potency as a serotonin (5-HT) inhibitor. Based on the possible involvement of serotonin in migraine attacks, it was introduced in 1959 by Sicuteri as a preventive drug for migraine. The clinical effect was often excellent, but 5 years later it was found to cause retroperitoneal fibrosis after chronic intake. 

Consequently, the use of the drug in migraine declined considerably, but it was still used as a 5-HT antagonist in experimental studies. In 1974 Saxena showed that methysergide had a selective vasoconstrictor effect in the carotid bed and in 1984 he found an atypical receptor. This finding provided an incentive for the development of [[sumatriptan]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Koehler|first=P. J.|last2=Tfelt-Hansen|first2=P. C.|date=November 2008|title=History of methysergide in migraine|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18644039/|journal=Cephalalgia: An International Journal of Headache|volume=28|issue=11|pages=1126–1135|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2982.2008.01648.x|issn=1468-2982|pmid=18644039}}</ref> 

Based on the possible involvement of serotonin in migraine attacks, it was introduced in 1959 by Sicuteri as a preventive drug for migraine. Methysergide was approved for use headaches by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1962. The clinical effect was often excellent, but 5 years later it was found to cause retroperitoneal fibrosis after chronic intake. Today patient's are therefore instructed to take a drug holiday.

[[Novartis]] withdrew it from the U.S. market after taking over [[Sandoz]], but currently lists it as a discontinued product.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.drugpatentwatch.com/p/NDA/012516|title=Sansert / methysergide maleate FDA New drug application 012516 international drug patent coverage, generic alternatives and suppliers|website=Deep knowledge on small-molecule drugs and the  global patents covering them|language=en|access-date=2017-09-06}}</ref>

=== Production and Availability ===
Methysergide has never been considered by the FDA or any other health regulatory body to be dangerous enough to warrant being pulled from the commercial marketplace. 

US production of Methysergide, (Sansert), was discontinued on the manufacturer's own behalf in 2002. Sansert had previously been produced by [[Sandoz]], which merged with [[Ciba-Geigy]] in 1996, and led to the creation of [[Novartis]]. In 2003 Novartis united its global generics businesses under a single global brand, with the Sandoz name and product line reviewed and reestablished. 

Sandoz's '''New Drug Application (NDA)''': 012516 for exclusive production and distribution of Sansert in the United States predates 1982 and most likely expired by 2003, as most drug patents have standing in the United States for 20 years. <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.drugsdb.com/blog/how-long-is-a-drug-patent-good-for.html|title=How Long Is A Drug Patent Good For? - Drugsdb.com|work=Drugsdb.com|access-date=2017-09-06|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Controversy ==
Methysergide has been as an effective treatment for migraine and cluster headache for over 50 years but has systematically been suppressed from the migraine and cluster headache marketplace for over 15 years due to unqualified risk benefit/ratio safety concerns. 

Many site the potential side effects of [[retroperitoneal fibrosis|retroperitoneal]]/retropulmonary fibrosis as the prime reason methysergide is no longer frequently prescribed, but retroperitoneal fibrosis, and retropulmonary fibrosis, were documented as side effects as early as 1966,<ref>1966 {{cite journal|last1=Webb|first1=John A.|date=30 Apr 1966|title=Methysergide and Retroperitoneal Fibrosis|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1844020/|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=1|issue=5495|page=1110|pages=|pmid=1844020|accessdate=6 September 2017|via=}}</ref> and 1967,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Graham|first1=Jr|date=17 Feb 1966|title=Fibrotic disorders associated with methysergide therapy for headache.|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5903120|journal=N Engl J Med.|volume=274|issue=(7)|pages=359-68|pmid=5903120|access-date=6 September 2017|via=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM196602172740701}}</ref> respectively. 

Updated guidelines published by Britain's [[NHS]] [[Migraine Trust]] in 2014 recommended "Methysergide medicines are now only to be used for preventing severe intractable migraine and cluster headache when standard medicines have failed". <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.migrainetrust.org/living-with-migraine/treatments/methysergide/|title=Methysergide - The Migraine Trust|work=The Migraine Trust|access-date=2017-09-06|language=en-GB}}</ref> 

It is still prescribed by some American neurologists for hard to treat cases buy placing prescription orders through online Canadian pharmacies. <ref>{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4684-0195-0|title=Management of Headache and Headache Medications|last1=Robbins|first1=Lawrence D.|date=Apr 17, 2013|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-0387989440|edition=2nd Edition|accessdate=6 September 2017}}</ref>
