====Available forms====
Quinine is a basic [[amine]] and is usually provided as a salt. Various existing preparations include the [[hydrochloride]], dihydrochloride, [[sulfate]], bisulfate and [[gluconate]]. In the United States, quinine sulfate is commercially available in 324-mg tablets under the brand name Qualaquin.

[[File:Tonic water uv.jpg|thumb|[[Tonic water]], in normal light and ultraviolet "[[black light]]"]]
Quinine is a flavour component of [[tonic water]] and [[bitter lemon]] [[drink mixer]]s. On the [[soda gun]] behind many bars, tonic water is designated by the letter "Q" representing quinine.<ref>{{cite book |last=Charming |first=Cheryl |title=Miss Charming's Guide for Hip Bartenders and Wayout Wannabes |page=189 |year=2006 |publisher=Sourcebooks, Inc. |location=USA |isbn=978-1-4022-0804-1 }}</ref>

According to tradition, the bitter taste of anti-[[malaria]]l quinine tonic led British colonials in [[presidencies and provinces of British India|India]] to mix it with [[gin]], thus creating the iconic [[gin and tonic]] cocktail, which is still popular today. Quinine is an ingredient in both tonic water and bitter lemon. In the US, quinine is listed as an ingredient in some Diet Snapple flavors, including Cranberry-Raspberry.

In France, quinine is an ingredient of an ''[[apéritif]]'' known as ''[[quinquina]]'' or "Cap Corse". In Spain, quinine ("Peruvian bark") is sometimes blended into sweet Malaga wine, which is then called "Malaga Quina". In Italy, the traditional flavoured wine [[Barolo#Barolo Chinato|Barolo Chinato]] is infused with quinine and local herbs and is served as a ''[[digestif]]''. In Canada and Italy, quinine is an ingredient in the [[carbonated beverage|carbonated]] [[chinotto (drink)|chinotto]] beverages Brio and San Pellegrino. In Scotland, the company [[A.G. Barr]] uses quinine as an ingredient in the carbonated and [[caffeinated beverage]] [[Irn-Bru]]. In Uruguay and Argentina, quinine is an ingredient of a [[PepsiCo]] tonic water named [[Paso de los Toros (drink)|Paso de los Toros]]. In Denmark, it is used as an ingredient in the carbonated sports drink [[Faxe Kondi]] made by [[Royal Unibrew]]. Quinine was also an ingredient in [[Kina Lillet]], an ingredient in the original Vesper martini ordered by [[James Bond]] in [[Casino Royale]].

As a flavoring agent in beverages, quinine is limited to less than 83 [[parts per million]] and 100 mg/l in the United States and European Union, respectively.<ref>{{cite journal |authorlink= |year=2005 |title=Effects of Quinine, Quinidine, and Chloroquine on α9α10 Nicotinic Cholinergic Receptors |journal=Molecular Pharmacology |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=822–829 |doi=10.1124/mol.105.014431 |url= |quote= |pmid=15955868 |last1=Ballestero |first1=JA |last2=Plazas |first2=PV |last3=Kracun |first3=S |last4=Gómez-Casati |first4=ME |last5=Taranda |first5=J |last6=Rothlin |first6=CV |last7=Katz |first7=E |last8=Millar |first8=NS |last9=Elgoyhen |first9=AB|displayauthors=8 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Food Additive Status List|url=https://www.fda.gov/food/ingredientspackaginglabeling/foodadditivesingredients/ucm091048.htm|website=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=9 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 872/2012|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1507509835974&uri=CELEX:32012R0872|website=EUR-Lex|publisher=Official Journal of the European Union|accessdate=9 October 2017}}</ref>

===Scientific===
Quinine (and [[quinidine]]) are used as the [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] moiety for the ligands used in [[Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation]] as well as for numerous other chiral catalyst backbones. Because of its relatively constant and well-known [[fluorescence]] [[quantum yield]], quinine is used in [[photochemistry]] as a common fluorescence [[Standard (metrology)|standard]].<ref name="books.google.co.in">Joseph R.

==Contraindications==
Quinine can cause abnormal heart rhythms, and should be avoided if possible in patients with [[atrial fibrillation]], [[conduction defect]]s, or [[heart block]]. Quinine can cause [[hemolysis]] in [[G6PD deficiency]] (an inherited deficiency), but this risk is small and the physician should not hesitate to use quinine in patients with G6PD deficiency when there is no alternative.<ref name=USlabel2013>{{cite web|title=US label: quinine sulfate|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/021799s023lbl.pdf|publisher=FDA|date=April 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120063419/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/021799s023lbl.pdf|archivedate=20 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Quinine can cause unpredictable serious and life-threatening blood and cardiovascular reactions including [[thrombocytopenia|low platelet count]] and [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]]/[[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]] (HUS/TTP), [[long QT syndrome]] and other serious cardiac arrhythmias including [[torsades de pointes]], [[blackwater fever]], [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]], [[leukopenia]], and [[neutropenia]].  Some people who have developed TTP due to quinine have gone on to develop [[kidney failure]].<ref name=USlabel2013/>

It can also cause serious hypersensitivity reactions include anaphylactic shock, [[urticaria]], serious skin rashes, including [[Stevens-Johnson syndrome]] and [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]], [[angioedema]], facial edema, bronchospasm, [[Idiopathic granulomatous hepatitis|granulomatous hepatitis]], and itchiness.<ref name=USlabel2013/>

The most common adverse effects involve a group of symptoms called [[cinchonism]]; almost everyone taking quinine has mild cinchonism {{Citation needed|reason=Need perhaps better phrasing and sources|date=August 2017}}, which can include headache, vasodilation and sweating, nausea, tinnitus, hearing impairment, vertigo or dizziness, blurred vision, and disturbance in color perception {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}. More severe cinchonism includes vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, deafness, blindness, and disturbances in heart rhythms.<ref name=USlabel2013/>  Cinchonism is much less common when quinine is given by mouth, but oral quinine is not well tolerated (quinine is exceedingly bitter and many patients will vomit after ingesting quinine tablets): Other drugs, such as Fansidar ([[sulfadoxine]] with [[pyrimethamine]]) or Malarone ([[proguanil]] with [[atovaquone]]), are often used when oral therapy is required. Quinine ethyl carbonate is tasteless and odourless,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Jamaludin A, Mohamad M, Navaratnam V, etal |title=Relative bioavailability of the hydrochloride, sulphate and ethyl carbonate salts of quinine |journal=Br J Clin Pharmacol |year=1988 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=261–3 |pmid=3358888 |pmc=1386482 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.1988.tb03299.x}}</ref> but is available commercially only in Japan. Blood glucose, electrolyte and cardiac monitoring are not necessary when quinine is given by mouth.

==Mechanism of action==
Quinine is theorized  to be toxic to the [[Plasmodium falciparum]] by interfering with the parasite's ability to dissolve and metabolize [[hemoglobin]].<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2017-02-24|editor-last=DrugBank|title=Quinine|url=https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00468|journal=DrugBank|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206104056/https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00468|archivedate=6 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> As with other quinoline antimalarial drugs, the [[mechanism of action]] of quinine has not been fully resolved.{{mcn|date = September 2015}} The most widely accepted hypothesis of its action is based on the well-studied and closely related quinoline drug, [[chloroquine]]. This model involves the inhibition of [[hemozoin]] [[biocrystallization]] in Heme Detoxification pathway, which facilitates the aggregation of [[cytotoxic]] [[heme]]. Free cytotoxic heme accumulates in the parasites, causing their deaths.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Quinoline antimalarials: mechanisms of action and resistance.|journal=Int J Parasitol.|author=Foley M, Tilley L|date=27 Feb 1997|pmid=9088993|volume=27|pages=231–40|doi=10.1016/s0020-7519(96)00152-x}}</ref>

===Synthesis===
{{Main article|quinine total synthesis}}
[[Cinchona|Cinchona trees]] remain the only economically practical source of quinine. However, under wartime pressure, research towards its synthetic production was undertaken. A formal chemical synthesis was accomplished in 1944 by American chemists [[Robert Burns Woodward|R.B. Woodward]] and [[W.E. Doering]].<ref name="Woodward1944">

The bark of ''[[Remijia]]'' contains 0.5–2% of quinine. The bark is cheaper than bark of ''[[Cinchona]]'', and as it has an intense taste it is used for making [[tonic water]].<ref name="Hobhouse">{{cite book |title=Šest rostlin, které změnily svět |last=Hobhouse |first=Henry |year=2004 |publisher=Akademie věd České republiky |location=Prague |isbn=80-200-1179-X |pages=59 |language=Czech }}</ref>

Malaria was responsible for the deaths of several [[pope]]s, many [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]s and countless common Roman citizens.

( …, we thought that we should name it "quinine" in order to distinguish it from cinchonine by means of a name that also indicates its origin.)</ref> The name was derived from the original [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] (Inca) word for the cinchona tree bark, ''quina'' or ''quina-quina'', which means "bark of bark" or "holy bark". Prior to 1820, the bark was first dried, ground to a fine powder, and then mixed into a liquid (commonly wine) which was then drunk.

It was the first effective treatment for malaria caused by ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'', appearing in therapeutics in the 17th century. It remained the antimalarial drug of choice until the 1940s, when other drugs, such as [[chloroquine]], that have fewer side effects replaced it. Since then, many effective antimalarials have been introduced, although quinine is still used to treat the disease in certain critical circumstances, such as severe malaria, and in impoverished regions, due to its low cost. Quinine is also present (in minute quantities) in various beverages. It is a white [[crystal]]line [[alkaloid]].

Quinine also played a significant role in the colonization of Africa by Europeans. Quinine had been said to be the prime reason Africa ceased to be known as the "white man's grave".

The FDA is also cautioning consumers about [[off-label use]] of quinine to treat leg cramps.
