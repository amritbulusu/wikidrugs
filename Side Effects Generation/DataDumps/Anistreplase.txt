Anistreplase has been developed by [[Beecham (pharmaceutical company)|Beecham]] as Eminase. It is also known as anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (APSAC)

==Mechanism==
It is a complex of purified human plasminogen and bacterial streptokinase that has been acylated to protect the enzyme's active site. When the drug is administered, the acyl group gets hydrolyzed, thereby freeing the activator complex. It converts [[plasminogen]] to [[plasmin]], which in turn degrades fibrin ([[blood clot]]s) to fibrin split products.
