'''Vinpocetine''' (brand names: '''Cavinton''', '''Intelectol'''; chemical name: '''ethyl apovincaminate''') is a synthetic [[derivative (chemistry)|derivative]] of the [[vinca alkaloid]] [[vincamine]] (sometimes described as "a [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] [[ethyl ester]] of [[apovincamine]]"),<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Lörincz C, Szász K, Kisfaludy L |title=The synthesis of ethyl apovincaminate |journal=Arzneimittel-Forschung |volume=26 |issue=10a |page=1907 |year=1976 |pmid=1037211}}</ref> an extract from the [[Vinca minor|lesser periwinkle]] plant. Vinpocetine was first isolated from the plant in 1975 by the Hungarian chemist Csaba Szántay. The mass production of the synthetic compound was started in 1978 by the Hungarian pharmaceutical company [[Gedeon Richter Plc.|Richter Gedeon]].

Vinpocetine is not FDA approved in the United States for therapeutic use. The [[U.S. Food & Drug Administration]] (FDA) has ruled that vinpocetine, due to its synthetic nature and proposed therapeutic uses, was ineligible to be marketed as [[dietary supplement]] under the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] (FDCA).<ref name="Newsweek_011217">{{cite news|last1=Schmitt|first1=Rick|title=Marketers exploit the aged with unproven brain-health claims|url=http://www.newsweek.com/marketers-exploit-aged-unproven-brain-health-claims-541709?rx=us|accessdate=January 18, 2016|publisher=[[Newsweek]]|date=January 12, 2017}}</ref><ref name="NI_090816">{{cite web|last1=Hank|first1=Schulz|title=eligible to be marketed as dietary supplement under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA)|url=http://www.nutraingredients-usa.com/Regulation/FDA-rules-vinpocetine-not-a-legal-dietary-ingredient-despite-successful-NDI-filings|website=NutraIngredients|publisher=William Reed Business Media, England|accessdate=September 8, 2016}}</ref><ref name="NW_011816">{{cite web|title=FDA Concludes Vinpocetine Ineligible as a Dietary Ingredient|url=http://www.nutraceuticalsworld.com/contents/view_online-exclusives/2016-09-20/fda-concludes-vinpocetine-ineligible-as-a-dietary-ingredient|website=Nutraceuticals World|publisher=Rodman Media|accessdate=January 18, 2017|date=September 20, 2016}}</ref><ref name="NW_020317">{{cite news|last1=Schmitt|first1=Rick|title=Dubious doses|url=https://www.pressreader.com/usa/newsweek/20170203/282071981620035|accessdate=September 24, 2017|publisher=[[Newsweek]]|date=February 3, 2017}}</ref>
