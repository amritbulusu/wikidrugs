'''1,3-Dimethylbutylamine''' ('''1,3-DMBA'''), or simply '''dimethylbutylamine''' ('''DMBA'''), is a [[stimulant]] [[drug]] [[structural analog|structurally related]] to [[methylhexanamine]] (1,3-dimethylamylamine (1,3-DMAA)) where a [[butyl]] group replaces the [[Amylum|amyl]] group. It is also known as '''AMP Citrate''' ('''4-amino-2-methylpentane citrate'''). The compound is an [[aliphatic amine]]. 

DMBA has been identified as an unapproved ingredient in some [[over-the-counter]] [[dietary supplement]]s,<ref name=Cohen>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/dta.1735| pmid = 25293509| title = A synthetic stimulant never tested in humans, 1,3-dimethylbutylamine (DMBA), is identified in multiple dietary supplements| journal = Drug Testing and Analysis| volume = 7| issue = 1| pages = 83–7| year = 2015| last1 = Cohen| first1 = Pieter A.| last2 = Travis| first2 = John C.| last3 = Venhuis| first3 = Bastiaan J.}}</ref><ref name= NSF >{{cite web | url = http://www.nsf.org/newsroom/unapproved-synthetic-stimulant-dmba-found-in-multiple-dietary-supplements/ | title = Unapproved Synthetic Stimulant “DMBA” Found in Multiple Dietary Supplements | publisher = NSF International }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidkroll/2015/05/06/fda-warns-14-sports-supplement-companies-of-illegal-dmba-amp-citrate/ | title = FDA Warns 14 Sports Supplement Companies Of Illegal DMBA (AMP Citrate) | publisher = ''[[Forbes]]'' | date = May 6, 2015}}</ref> in which it is used in an apparent attempt to avoid laws prohibiting the use of methylhexanamine.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stimulant Potentially Dangerous to Health, FDA Warns|url=http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm347270.htm|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=March 10, 2015|date=April 11, 2013}}</ref> The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) considers any dietary supplement containing DMBA to be "adulterated".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/Food/DietarySupplements/QADietarySupplements/ucm444719.htm | title = DMBA in Dietary Supplements | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration]]}}</ref>
