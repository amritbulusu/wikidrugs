'''Opium''' ('''poppy tears''', with the scientific name: ''Lachryma papaveris'') is the dried [[latex]] obtained from the [[Papaver somniferum|opium poppy]] (scientific name: ''Papaver somniferum'').<ref name="DrugsCom">{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/dict/opium.html|title=Opium definition|publisher=[[Drugs.com]]|access-date=February 28, 2015}}</ref> Opium latex contains approximately 12 percent of the analgesic [[alkaloid]] [[morphine]], which is processed chemically to produce [[heroin]] and other synthetic [[opioid]]s for medicinal use and for [[illegal drug trade]]. The latex also contains the closely related [[opiate]]s [[codeine]] and [[thebaine]], and non-analgesic [[alkaloid]]s such as [[papaverine]] and [[noscapine]]. The traditional, labor-intensive method of obtaining the latex is to scratch ("score") the immature seed pods (fruits) by hand; the latex leaks out and dries to a sticky yellowish residue that is later scraped off and dehydrated. The word "[[meconium]]" (derived from the Greek for "opium-like", but now used to refer to infant stools) historically referred to related, weaker preparations made from other parts of the opium poppy or different species of poppies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hon.ch/Dossier/MotherChild/labor_complications/birth_meconium.html|title=HON Mother & Child Glossary, Meconium|author=Simon O'Dochartaigh|date=|work=hon.ch|accessdate=April 4, 2016}}</ref>

The production of opium has not changed since ancient times. Through selective breeding of the ''Papaver somniferum'' plant, the content of the [[phenanthrene]] alkaloids morphine, [[codeine]], and to a lesser extent [[thebaine]] has been greatly increased. In modern times, much of the thebaine, which often serves as the raw material for the synthesis for [[hydrocodone]], [[hydromorphone]], and other [[semisynthesis|semisynthetic]] opiates, originates from extracting ''[[Papaver orientale]]'' or ''[[Papaver bracteatum]]''.

For the illegal drug trade, the morphine is extracted from the opium, reducing the bulk weight by 88%. It is then converted to [[heroin]] which is two to four times as potent,<ref name="Sawynok 1986">{{cite journal | author = Sawynok J | title = The therapeutic use of heroin: a review of the pharmacological literature | journal = Canadian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology | volume = 64 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–6 | date = January 1986 | pmid = 2420426 | doi = 10.1139/y86-001 | url = }}</ref> and increases the value by two to four times.

Opium has been actively collected since prehistoric times. Though western scholars typically estimate this to be around 1500 BCE. Indian scholars maintain that the verses and the history contained in them have been orally transmitted thousands of years before. A common name for males in Afghanistan is "Redey", which in [[Pashto language|Pashto]] means "poppy".<ref>[http://www.khyber.org/culture/names/boynames.shtml Pashto Names for Boys], khyber.org</ref> This term may be derived from the Sanskrit words ''rddhi'' and ''hrdya'', which mean "magical", "a type of medicinal plant", and "heart-pleasing", respectively.{{ambiguous|date=June 2014}} The upper Asian belt of Afghanistan, Pakistan, northern India, and Burma still account for the world's largest supply of opium.

At least 17 finds of ''Papaver somniferum'' from [[Neolithic]] settlements have been reported throughout Switzerland, Germany, and Spain, including the placement of large numbers of poppy seed capsules at a burial site (the ''Cueva de los Murciélagos'', or "Bat Cave", in Spain), which have been carbon-14 dated to 4200 BCE.

Opium production continued under the [[Babylonians]] and [[Egyptians]].

Opium was used with [[poison hemlock]] to put people quickly and painlessly to death, but it was also used in medicine. The [[Ebers Papyrus]], {{circa|1500}} BCE, describes a way to "stop a crying child" using grains of the poppy plant strained to a pulp.{{clarify|reason=what part of the plant is meant by the word "grains"?|date=June 2014}} ''[[Spongia somnifera]]'', sponges soaked in opium, were used during surgery.<ref name="Brownstein" /> The Egyptians cultivated ''opium thebaicum'' in famous poppy fields around 1300 BCE.

=== Reintroduction to Western medicine ===

[[File:Canons of medicine.JPG|thumb|right|Latin translation of [[Avicenna]]'s ''Canon of Medicine'', 1483]]

Manuscripts of [[Pseudo-Apuleius]]'s 5th-century work from the 10th and 11th centuries refer to the use of wild poppy ''[[Papaver agreste]]'' or ''[[Papaver rhoeas]]'' (identified as ''P. silvaticum'') instead of ''P. somniferum'' for inducing sleep and relieving pain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collecties.meermanno.nl/handschriften/search?SearchString=papaver|title=Pseudo-Apuleius: Papaver|accessdate=June 15, 2007}}</ref>

The use of [[Paracelsus]]' [[laudanum]] was introduced to Western medicine in 1527, when Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, better known by the name Paracelsus, returned from his wanderings in Arabia with a famous sword, within the pommel of which he kept "Stones of Immortality" compounded from opium thebaicum, citrus juice, and "quintessence of gold".<ref name="Frontline" /><ref name="nzepc.auckland.ac.nz">{{cite web|url=http://www.nzepc.auckland.ac.nz/authors/young/paracelsus.asp|title=Paracelsus: the philosopher's stone made flesh|accessdate=May 4, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/books/review/2006/04/18/devils_doctor/|title=The devil's doctor|accessdate=May 4, 2007}}</ref> The name "Paracelsus" was a pseudonym signifying him the equal or better of [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]], whose text, which described the use of opium or a similar preparation, had recently been translated and reintroduced to medieval Europe.<ref>{{cite web|title=PARACELSUS, Five Hundred Years: Three American Exhibits|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/paracelsus/paracelsus_1.html|accessdate=June 6, 2007}}</ref> ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'', the standard medical textbook Paracelsus burned in a public bonfire three weeks after being appointed professor at the [[University of Basel]], also described the use of opium, though many Latin translations were of poor quality.<ref name="nzepc.auckland.ac.nz" /> ''[[Laudanum]]'' was originally the 16th-century term for a medicine associated with a particular physician that was widely well-regarded, but became standardized as "[[tincture]] of opium", a solution of opium in [[ethanol]], which Paracelsus has been credited with developing. During his lifetime, Paracelsus was viewed as an adventurer who challenged the theories and mercenary motives of contemporary medicine with dangerous chemical therapies, but his therapies marked a turning point in Western medicine. In the 1660s, laudanum was recommended for pain, sleeplessness, and diarrhea by [[Thomas Sydenham]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drugs.uta.edu/laudanum.html|author1=Stephen Harding |author2=Lee Ann Olivier |author3=Olivera Jokic  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Victorians' Secret: Victorian Substance Abuse|accessdate=May 2, 2007}}</ref> the renowned "father of English medicine" or "English Hippocrates", to whom is attributed the quote, "Among the remedies which it has pleased Almighty God to give to man to relieve his sufferings, none is so universal and so efficacious as opium."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/1989.html|author=Ole Daniel Enersen|title=Thomas Sydenham|accessdate=May 2, 2007}}</ref>
Use of opium as a cure-all was reflected in the formulation of [[mithridatium]] described in the 1728 ''[[Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Chambers Cyclopedia]]'', which included true opium in the mixture. Subsequently, laudanum became the basis of many popular [[patent medicine]]s of the 19th century.

Compared to other chemicals available to 18th century regular physicians, opium was a benign alternative to the arsenics, mercuries, or emetics, and it was remarkably successful in alleviating a wide range of ailments. Due to the constipation often produced by the consumption of opium, it was one of the most effective treatments for cholera, dysentery, and diarrhea. As a cough suppressant, opium was used to treat bronchitis, tuberculosis, and other respiratory illnesses. Opium was additionally prescribed for rheumatism and insomnia.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Aurin|first=Marcus|date=January 1, 2000|title=Chasing the Dragon: The Cultural Metamorphosis of Opium in the United States, 1825–1935|jstor=649506|journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly|volume=14|issue=3|pages=414–441|pmid=11036586|doi=10.1525/maq.2000.14.3.414}}</ref>

During the 18th century, opium was found to be a good remedy for nervous disorders. Due to its sedative and tranquilizing properties, it was used to quiet the minds of those with psychosis, help with people who were considered insane, and also to help treat patients with insomnia.<ref name="KramerJohn">{{cite journal | author = Kramer John C | year = 1979 | title = Opium Rampant: Medical Use, Misuse and Abuse in Britain and the West in the 17th and 18th Centuries | url = | journal = British Journal Of Addiction | volume = 74 | issue = 4| pages = 377–389 }}</ref> However, despite its medicinal values in these cases, it was noted that in cases of psychosis, it could cause anger or depression, and due to the drug's euphoric effects, it could cause depressed patients to become more depressed after the effects wore off because they would get used to being high.<ref name="KramerJohn" />

The standard medical use of opium persisted well into the 19th century. US president [[William Henry Harrison]] was treated with opium in 1841, and in the [[American Civil War]], the Union Army used {{convert|2.8|e6oz|kg|order=flip}} of opium tincture and powder and about 500,000 opium pills.<ref name="Schiff" /> During this time of popularity, users called opium "God's Own Medicine".<ref>{{cite web|author=Donna Young|date=April 15, 2007|url=http://www.ashp.org/s_ashp/article_news.asp?CID=167&DID=2024&id=19461|title=Scientists Examine Pain Relief and Addiction|accessdate=June 6, 2007}}</ref>

One reason for the increase in opiate consumption in the United States during the 19th century was the prescribing and dispensing of legal opiates by physicians and pharmacists to women with "female complaints" (mostly to relieve menstrual pain and [[Female hysteria|hysteria]]).<ref name=":0" /> Because opiates were viewed as more humane than punishment or restraint, they were often used to treat the mentally ill. Between 150,000 and 200,000 opiate addicts lived in the United States in the late 19th century and between two-thirds and three-quarters of these addicts were women.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nida.nih.gov/PDF/DARHW/033-052_Kandall.pdf |title=Drug Addiction Research and the Health of Women – pg. 33–52 |format=PDF |accessdate=March 21, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080822032249/http://www.nida.nih.gov/PDF/DARHW/033-052_Kandall.pdf |archivedate = August 22, 2008}}</ref>

Opium addiction in the later 19th century received a hereditary definition. Dr. George Beard in 1869 proposed his theory of [[neurasthenia]], a hereditary nervous system deficiency that could predispose an individual to addiction. Neurasthenia was increasingly tied in medical rhetoric to the "nervous exhaustion" suffered by many a white-collar worker in the increasingly hectic and industrialized U.S. life—the most likely potential clients of physicians.

===China===
In China, recreational use began in the 15th century,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} but was limited by its rarity and expense. Opium trade became more regular by the 17th century, when it was mixed with tobacco for smoking, and addiction was first recognized. Prior to the arrival of the [[tobacco pipe]], opium was only taken orally; when smoked, the drug has a far more potent effect, and its addictive effect is greatly magnified.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Opium prohibition in China began in 1729, yet was followed by nearly two centuries of increasing opium use. China had a positive balance sheet in trading with the British, which led to a decrease of the British silver stocks. Therefore, the British tried to encourage Chinese opium use to enhance their balance, and they delivered it from Indian provinces under British control. In India, its cultivation, as well as the manufacture and traffic to China, were subject to the [[British East India Company]] (BEIC), as a strict monopoly of the British government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bihargatha.in/early-agriculture-based-enterprenureships/opeum-factories |title=Opium Factories of Bihar – Bihargatha |publisher=Bihargatha.in |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref> Indian farmers were forced by the British East India company to grow poppy against their wishes, often using a combination of strong arm tactics and debt.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dalrymple|first1=William|title=The East India Company: The original corporate raiders|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/04/east-india-company-original-corporate-raiders|accessdate=15 February 2017|publisher=The Guardian|date=4 March 2015}}</ref> There was an extensive and complicated system of BEIC agencies involved in the supervision and management of opium production and distribution in India. [[Destruction of opium at Humen|A massive destruction of opium]] by an emissary of the Chinese [[Daoguang Emperor]] in an attempt to stop opium imports led to the [[First Opium War]] (1839{{ndash}}1842), in which Britain defeated China. After 1860, opium use continued to increase with widespread domestic production in China. By 1905, an estimated 25 percent of the male population were regular consumers of the drug. Recreational use of opium elsewhere in the world remained rare into late in the 19th century, as indicated by ambivalent reports of opium usage.<ref>Opium : Dikotter, Frank, Lars Laamann and Zhou Xun. 2004.

Global regulation of opium began{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} with the stigmatization of Chinese immigrants and [[opium den]]s in San Francisco, California. This led rapidly to town ordinances in the 1870s and the formation of the [[International Opium Commission]] in 1909. During this period, the portrayal of opium in literature became squalid and violent.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} British opium trade was largely supplanted by domestic Chinese production. Purified [[morphine]] and heroin became widely available for injection and [[patent medicines]] containing [[opiate]]s reached a peak in recreational use. Opium was [[drug prohibition|prohibited]] in many countries during the early 20th century, leading to the modern pattern of opium production as a precursor for illegal [[recreational drug]]s or tightly regulated legal prescription drugs. Illicit opium production, now dominated by [[opium production in Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], was decimated in 2000, when production was banned by the [[Taliban]], but has increased steadily since the fall of the Taliban and western occupation in 2001 and over the course of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Paul Harris in Peshawar |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,605618,00.html |title=Victorious warlords set to open the opium floodgates |publisher=Observer.guardian.co.uk |date= November 25, 2001|accessdate=March 21, 2010 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/pdf/research/wdr07/WDR_2007_3.1.1_afghanistan.pdf |title=UN World Drug Report 2007 – Afghanistan |format=PDF |accessdate=March 21, 2010}}</ref> Worldwide production in 2006 was 6610 metric tons<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/pdf/research/wdr07/WDR_2007_1.2_opium_heroin.pdf |title=0.0_Front Matters_05-31-07.qxd |format=PDF |accessdate=March 21, 2010}}</ref>—about one-fifth the level of production in 1906.

=== Recreational use in China ===
{{See also|History of opium in China|Opium den}}

[[File:中國人服食鴉片圖.PNG|thumb|An opium den in 18th-century China through the eyes of a Western artist]]

The earliest clear description of the use of opium as a [[recreational drug]] in China came from Xu Boling, who wrote in 1483 that opium was "mainly used to aid masculinity, strengthen sperm and regain vigor", and that it "enhances the art of alchemists, sex and court ladies". He also described an expedition sent by the [[Ming dynasty]] [[Chenghua Emperor]] in 1483 to procure opium for a price "equal to that of gold" in [[Hainan]], Fujian, [[Zhejiang]], Sichuan and [[Shaanxi]], where it is close to the western lands of [[Western Regions|Xiyu]]. A century later, [[Li Shizhen]] listed standard medical uses of opium in his renowned ''[[Compendium of Materia Medica]]'' (1578), but also wrote that "lay people use it for the art of sex," in particular the ability to "arrest seminal emission". This association of opium with sex continued in China until the end of the 19th century.

Opium smoking began as a privilege of the elite and remained a great luxury into the early 19th century. However, by 1861, [[Wang Tao (19th century)|Wang Tao]] wrote that opium was used even by rich peasants, and even a small village without a rice store would have a shop where opium was sold.<ref name="Zheng">{{cite journal|author=Yangwen Zheng|title=The Social Life of Opium in China, 1483–1999|journal=Modern Asian Studies|volume=37|issue=1|pages=1–39|year=2003|doi=10.1017/S0026749X0300101X}}</ref>

[[File:Opium smokers China.gif|thumb|left|A Chinese opium house, photograph 1902]]

Smoking of opium came on the heels of tobacco smoking and may have been encouraged by a brief ban on the smoking of tobacco by the Ming emperor. The prohibition ended in 1644 with the coming of the [[Qing dynasty]], which encouraged smokers to mix in increasing amounts of opium.<ref name="Schiff" /> In 1705, [[Wang Shizhen]] wrote, "nowadays, from nobility and gentlemen down to slaves and women, all are addicted to tobacco." Tobacco in that time was frequently mixed with other herbs (this continues with [[clove cigarettes]] to the modern day), and opium was one component in the mixture. Tobacco mixed with opium was called ''[[madak]]'' (or ''madat'') and became popular throughout China and its seafaring trade partners (such as Taiwan, [[Java]], and the Philippines) in the 17th century.<ref name="Zheng" /> In 1712, [[Engelbert Kaempfer]] described [[Substance use disorder|addiction]] to ''madak'': "No commodity throughout the [[East Indies|Indies]] is retailed with greater profit by the [[Jakarta|Batavians]] than opium, which [its] users cannot do without, nor can they come by it except it be brought by the ships of the Batavians from [[Bengal]] and [[Coromandel Coast|Coromandel]]."<ref name="Trocki" />

Fueled in part by the 1729 ban on ''madak'', which at first effectively exempted pure opium as a potentially medicinal product, the smoking of pure opium became more popular in the 18th century. In 1736, the smoking of pure opium was described by [[Huang Shujing]], involving a pipe made from bamboo rimmed with silver, stuffed with palm slices and hair, fed by a clay bowl in which a globule of molten opium was held over the flame of an oil lamp. This elaborate procedure, requiring the maintenance of pots of opium at just the right temperature for a globule to be scooped up with a needle-like skewer for smoking, formed the basis of a craft of "paste-scooping" by which servant girls could become prostitutes as the opportunity arose.<ref name="Zheng" />

=== Chinese diaspora ===

The [[Chinese Diaspora]] (1800s to 1949) first began during the 19th-century due to famine and political upheaval, as well as rumors of wealth to be had outside of Southeast Asia. Chinese emigrants to cities such as San Francisco, London, and New York brought with them the Chinese manner of opium smoking, and the social traditions of the [[opium den]].<ref name="sfmuseum.org">{{cite news |url=http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist9/cook.html|title=San Francisco's Old Chinatown|author=Commissioner Jesse B.

Because of the low social status of immigrant workers, contemporary writers and media had little trouble portraying opium dens as seats of vice, [[sexual slavery|white slavery]], gambling, knife- and revolver-fights, and a source for drugs causing deadly overdoses, with the potential to addict and corrupt the white population. By 1919, anti-Chinese riots attacked [[Limehouse]], the [[Chinatown, London|Chinatown of London]]. Chinese men were deported for playing [[keno]] and sentenced to hard labor for opium possession. Due to this, both the immigrant population and the social use of opium fell into decline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/templates/news/detail.cfm?newsid=7262|publisher=Tower Hamlets Newsletter|title=When a woman ruled Chinatown|author=John Rennie|date=March 26, 2007|accessdate=May 12, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100210150255/http://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/templates/news/detail.cfm?newsid=7262 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = February 10, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lascars.co.uk/plafeb1931.html|title=Lascars in the port of London|author=J.P.

[[File:Destruction of opium in 1839.jpg|thumb|[[Destruction of opium at Humen]], June 1839]]

Opium prohibition began in 1729, when the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] [[Yongzheng Emperor]], disturbed by ''[[madak]]'' smoking at court and carrying out the government's role of upholding [[Confucian]] virtues, officially prohibited the sale of opium, except for a small amount for medicinal purposes. The ban punished sellers and [[opium den]] keepers, but not users of the drug.<ref name="Trocki" /> Opium was banned completely in 1799, and this prohibition continued until 1860.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldentrianglepark.org/swf/timeline.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20080626223320/http://www.goldentrianglepark.org/swf/timeline.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=June 26, 2008|title=Opium timeline|publisher=The Golden Triangle|accessdate=September 13, 2009 }}</ref>

[[File:William John Huggins - The opium ships at Lintin, China, 1824.jpg|thumb|left|British opium ships]]

During the Qing dynasty, China opened itself to foreign trade under the [[Canton System]] through the port of [[Guangzhou]] (Canton), with traders from the [[East India Company]] visiting the port by the 1690s. Due to the growing British demand for Chinese tea and the Chinese Emperor's lack of interest in British commodities other than silver, British traders resorted to trade in opium as a high-value commodity for which China was not self-sufficient. The English traders had been purchasing small amounts of opium from India for trade since [[Ralph Fitch]] first visited in the mid-16th century.<ref name="Trocki" /> Trade in opium was standardized, with production of balls of raw opium, {{convert|1.1-1.6|kg|abbr=on}}, 30% water content, wrapped in poppy leaves and petals, and shipped in chests of {{convert|60–65|kg|abbr=on}} (one [[picul]]).<ref name="Trocki" />
Chests of opium were sold in auctions in [[Calcutta]] with the understanding that the independent purchasers would then smuggle it into China.

After the 1757 [[Battle of Plassey]] and 1764 [[Battle of Buxar]], the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] East India Company gained the power to act as ''[[diwan (title)|diwan]]'' of [[Bengal]], Bihar, and [[Odisha]] ''(See [[company rule in India]])''. This allowed the company to exercise a [[monopoly]] over opium production and export in India, to encourage [[ryot]]s to cultivate the cash crops of [[Indigofera|indigo]] and opium with cash advances, and to prohibit the "hoarding" of rice. This strategy led to the increase of the land tax to 50 percent of the value of crops and to the doubling of East India Company profits by 1777. It is also claimed to have contributed to the starvation of 10 million people in the [[Bengal famine of 1770]]. Beginning in 1773, the British government began enacting oversight of the company's operations, and in response to the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], this policy culminated in the establishment of direct rule over the [[presidencies and provinces of British India]]. Bengal opium was highly prized, commanding twice the price of the domestic Chinese product, which was regarded as inferior in quality.<ref name="McCoy opium">{{cite web|url=http://www.a1b2c3.com/drugs/opi010.htm |title=Opium History, 1858 to 1940 |author=Alfred W.

Some competition came from the newly independent United States, which began to compete in Guangzhou, selling Turkish opium in the 1820s. Portuguese traders also brought opium from the independent Malwa states of western India, although by 1820, the British were able to restrict this trade by charging "pass duty" on the opium when it was forced to pass through Bombay to reach an ''[[entrepot]]''.<ref name="Trocki" />
Despite drastic penalties and continued prohibition of opium until 1860, opium importation rose steadily from 200 chests per year under the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] to 1,000 under the [[Qianlong Emperor]], 4,000 under the [[Jiaqing Emperor]], and 30,000 under the [[Daoguang Emperor]].<ref>Wertz, Richard R.

In response to the ever-growing number of Chinese people becoming addicted to opium, the Qing [[Daoguang Emperor]] took strong action to halt the import of opium, including the seizure of cargo. In 1838, the Chinese Commissioner [[Lin Zexu]] destroyed 20,000 chests of opium in Guangzhou.<ref name="Trocki" /> Given that a chest of opium was worth nearly {{US$|1,000|link=yes}} in 1800, this was a substantial economic loss. The British queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]], not willing to replace the cheap opium with costly silver, began the [[First Opium War]] in 1840, the British winning Hong Kong and trade concessions in the first of a series of [[Unequal Treaties]].

Following China's defeat in the [[Second Opium War]] in 1858, China was forced to legalize opium and began massive domestic production. Importation of opium peaked in 1879 at 6,700 tons, and by 1906, China was producing 85 percent of the world's opium, some 35,000 tons, and 27 percent of its adult male population regularly used opium{{nsmdns}}13.5{{nbsp}}million people consuming 39,000 tons of opium yearly.<ref name="McCoy opium" /> From 1880 to the beginning of the Communist era, the British attempted to discourage the use of opium in China, but this effectively promoted the use of [https://www.opiates.com/morphine/ morphine], heroin, and cocaine, further exacerbating the problem of addiction.<ref>[[Frank Dikötter|Dikötter, Frank]]; Lars Laamann; and Zhou Xun ''Narcotic Culture: A History of Drugs in China.''

Scientific evidence of the pernicious nature of opium use was largely undocumented in the 1890s, when Protestant [[Mission (Christian)|missionaries]] in China decided to strengthen their opposition to the trade by compiling data which would demonstrate the harm the drug did. Faced with the problem that many Chinese associated Christianity with opium, partly due to the arrival of early Protestant missionaries on opium clippers, at the 1890 Shanghai Missionary Conference, they agreed to establish the Permanent Committee for the Promotion of Anti-Opium Societies in an attempt to overcome this problem and to arouse public opinion against the opium trade. The members of the committee were [[John Glasgow Kerr]], MD, American Presbyterian Mission in Canton; [[Boudinot Currie Atterbury|B.C. Atterbury, MD]], American Presbyterian Mission in Peking; Archdeacon [[Arthur Evans Moule|Arthur E. Moule]], Church Missionary Society in Shanghai; Henry Whitney, MD, American Board of Commissioners for foreign Missions in Foochow; the Rev. Samuel Clarke, China Inland Mission in Kweiyang; the Rev. [[Arthur Gostick Shorrock]], English Baptist Mission in Taiyuan; and the Rev. [[Griffith John]], London Mission Society in Hankow.<ref>Lodwick, Kathleen L. (1996).

University Press of Kentucky. {{ISBN|0-8131-1924-3}}</ref> These missionaries were generally outraged over the British government's [[Royal Commission on Opium]] visiting India but not China. Accordingly, the missionaries first organized the [[Anti-Opium League in China]] among their colleagues in every mission station in China. American missionary [[Hampden Coit DuBose]] acted as first president. This organization, which had elected national officers and held an annual national meeting, was instrumental in gathering data from every Western-trained medical doctor in China, which was then published as [[William Hector Park]] compiled ''Opinions of Over 100 Physicians on the Use of Opium in China'' (Shanghai: American Presbyterian Mission Press, 1899). The vast majority of these medical doctors were missionaries; the survey also included doctors who were in private practices, particularly in Shanghai and Hong Kong, as well as Chinese who had been trained in medical schools in Western countries. In England, the home director of the [[China Inland Mission]], [[Benjamin Broomhall]], was an active opponent of the opium trade, writing two books to promote the banning of opium smoking: ''The Truth about Opium Smoking'' and ''The Chinese Opium Smoker''. In 1888, Broomhall formed and became secretary of the Christian Union for the Severance of the British Empire with the Opium Traffic and editor of its periodical, ''National Righteousness''. He lobbied the [[British Parliament]] to stop the opium trade. He and [[James Laidlaw Maxwell]] appealed to the London Missionary Conference of 1888 and the Edinburgh Missionary Conference of 1910 to condemn the continuation of the trade. When Broomhall was dying, his son Marshall read to him from ''[[The Times]]'' the welcome news that an agreement had been signed ensuring the end of the opium trade within two years.

Official Chinese resistance to opium was renewed on September 20, 1906, with an antiopium initiative intended to eliminate the drug problem within 10 years. The program relied on the turning of public sentiment against opium, with mass meetings at which [[drug paraphernalia|opium paraphernalia]] were publicly burned, as well as coercive legal action and the granting of police powers to organizations such as the Fujian Anti-Opium Society. Smokers were required to register for licenses for gradually reducing rations of the drug. Action against opium farmers centred upon a highly repressive incarnation of law enforcement in which rural populations had their property destroyed, their land confiscated and/or were publicly tortured, humiliated and executed.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Windle J | year = 2013 | title = 'Harms Caused by China's 1906–17 Opium Suppression Intervention' | url = | journal = International Journal of Drug Policy | volume = 24 | issue = 5| pages = 498–505 }}</ref> Addicts sometimes turned to missionaries for treatment for their addiction, though many associated these foreigners with the drug trade.

In the northern provinces of [[Ningxia]] and [[Suiyuan]] in China, [[Hui people|Chinese Muslim]] General [[Ma Fuxiang]] both prohibited and engaged in the opium trade.

The [[Mao Zedong]] government is generally credited with eradicating both consumption and production of opium during the 1950s using unrestrained repression and social reform.{{Citation needed| reason=who conducted a survey that concludes "generally credited"?| date=August 2013}} Ten million addicts were forced into compulsory treatment, dealers were executed, and opium-producing regions were planted with new crops.

=== Prohibition outside China ===

There were no legal restrictions on the importation or use of opium in the United States until the San Francisco Opium Den Ordinance, which banned dens for public smoking of opium in 1875, a measure fueled by anti-Chinese sentiment and the perception that whites were starting to frequent the dens. This was followed by an 1891 California law requiring that narcotics carry warning labels and that their sales be recorded in a registry; amendments to the California Pharmacy and Poison Act in 1907 made it a crime to sell opiates without a prescription, and bans on possession of opium or [[opium pipe]]s in 1909 were enacted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.november.org/stayinfo/breaking07/CA-WOD.html|title=State's War on Drugs – a 100-Year Bust|author=Dale Gieringer|date=March 4, 2007}}</ref>

At the US federal level, the legal actions taken reflected constitutional restrictions under the [[enumerated powers]] doctrine prior to reinterpretation of the [[commerce clause]], which did not allow the federal government to enact arbitrary prohibitions, but did permit arbitrary taxation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcwilliams.com/books/aint/303a.htm|title=Ain't Nobody's Business If You Do|author=Peter McWilliams}}</ref> Beginning in 1883, opium importation was taxed at {{US$|6}} to {{US$|300}} per pound, until the Opium Exclusion Act of 1909 prohibited the importation of opium altogether. In a similar manner, the [[Harrison Narcotics Tax Act]] of 1914, passed in fulfillment of the [[International Opium Convention]] of 1912, nominally placed a tax on the distribution of opiates, but served as a ''de facto'' prohibition of the drugs. Today, opium is regulated by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] under the [[Controlled Substances Act]].

Following passage of a Colonial Australian law in 1895, Queensland's [[Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897]] addressed opium addiction among [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal people]], though it soon became a general vehicle for depriving them of basic rights by administrative regulation. By 1905 all Australian states and territories had passed similar laws making prohibitions to Opium sale. Smoking and possession was prohibited in 1908.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/liac/hot_topic/hottopic/2000/4/2.html|author=Legal Information Access Centre|title=Drug laws in Australia}}</ref>

Hardening of Canadian attitudes toward Chinese opium users and fear of a spread of the drug into the white population led to the effective criminalization of opium for nonmedical use in Canada between 1908 and the mid-1920s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.projectcork.org/bibliographies/data/Bibliography_Historical.html|author=Carstairs C.|title=Jailed for Possession: Illegal Drug Use, Regulation, and Power in Canada, 1920–61|year=2006}}</ref>

In 1909, the [[International Opium Commission]] was founded, and by 1914, 34 nations had agreed that the production and importation of opium should be diminished. In 1924, 62 nations participated in a meeting of the Commission. Subsequently, this role passed to the [[League of Nations]], and all signatory nations agreed to prohibit the import, sale, distribution, export, and use of all narcotic drugs, except for medical and scientific purposes. This role was later taken up by the [[International Narcotics Control Board]] of the United Nations under [[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Article 23: NATIONAL OPIUM AGENCIES|Article 23]] of the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]], and subsequently under the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]]. Opium-producing nations are required to designate a [[government agency]] to take physical possession of licit opium crops as soon as possible after harvest and conduct all wholesaling and exporting through that agency.<ref name="Schiff" />

=== Regulation in Britain and the United States ===

Before the 1920s, regulation in Britain was controlled by the pharmacists. Pharmacists that were found to have prescribed opium for illegitimate causes and anyone found to have sold opium without proper qualifications would be prosecuted.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Anderson Stuart, Berridge Virginia | year = 2000 | title = Opium In 20th-Century Britain: Pharmacists, Regulation And The People | url = | journal = Addiction | volume = 95 | issue = 1| pages = 23–36 }}</ref> Due to the passing of the Rolleston Act in Britain in 1926, doctors could prescribe opiates such as morphine and heroin on their own accord if they felt their patients demonstrated a medical need. Because addiction was viewed as a medical problem rather than an indulgence, doctors were permitted to allow patients to wean themselves off opiates rather than cutting off any opiate use altogether.<ref name="BrownRichard">{{cite journal | author = Brown Richard Harvey | year = 2002 | title = The Opium Trade And Opium Policies In India, China, Britain, And The United States: Historical Comparisons And Theoretical Interpretations | url = | journal = Asian Journal Of Social Science | volume = 30 | issue = 3| page = 623 }}</ref> The passing of the Rolleston Act put the control of opium use in the hands of medical doctors instead of pharmacists. Later in the 20th century, the addiction to opiates, especially [https://www.opiates.com/heroin/ heroin] in young people, continued to rise and so the sale and prescription of opiates was limited to doctors in treatment centers. If these doctors were found to be prescribing opiates without just cause, then they could lose their license to practice or prescribe drugs.<ref name="BrownRichard" />
The abuse of opium in the United States began in the late 19th century and was largely stigmatized with Chinese immigrants. During this time the use of opium had little negative connotation and was used freely until 1882 when a law was passed to confine opium smoking to specific dens.<ref name="BrownRichard" /> Until the full ban on opium based products came into effect just after the turn of the century, physicians in the US considered opium a miracle drug that could help with many ailments. Therefore, the ban on said products was more a result of negative connotations towards its use and distribution by Chinese immigrants who were heavily persecuted during this particular period in history.<ref name="BrownRichard" /> As the 19th century progressed however, there was a doctor by the name of [[Hamilton Wright]] that worked to decrease the use of opium in the US by submitting the Harrison Act to congress. This act put taxes and restrictions on the sale and prescription of opium, as well as trying to stigmatize the opium poppy and its derivatives as "demon drugs", to try and scare people away from them.<ref name="BrownRichard" /> This act and the stigma of a demon drug on opium, led to the criminalization of people that used opium-based products. It made the use and possession of opium and any of its derivatives illegal to use. The restrictions were recently redefined by the Federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/regulatoryinformation/legislation/ucm148726.htm|title=Legislation - Controlled Substances Act|last=Commissioner|first=Office of the|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/opium.html|title=Opium - Poppy Cultivation, Morphine and Heroin Manufacture|website=erowid.org|access-date=2017-01-25}}</ref>

During the Communist era in Eastern Europe, poppy stalks sold in bundles by farmers were processed by users with household chemicals to make ''kompot'' ("[[Polish heroin]]"), and poppy seeds were used to produce ''koknar'', an opiate.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,145798,00.html?iid=chix-sphere|title=Eastern Europe Shooting Up Under A Red Star|author=Jennifer Hull|date=June 24, 2001|accessdate=May 10, 2007 | work=Time}}</ref>

Globally, opium has gradually been superseded by a variety of purified, semi-synthetic, and synthetic [[opioids]] with progressively stronger effects, and by other [[general anesthetics]]. This process began in 1804, when [[Friedrich Sertürner|Friedrich Wilhelm Adam Sertürner]] first isolated morphine from the opium poppy.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Morimoto | first=Satoshi |author2=Kazunari Suemori |author3=Jun Moriwaki |author4=Futoshi Taura |author5=Hiroyuki Tanaka |author6=Mariko Aso |author7=Masakazu Tanaka |author8=Hiroshi Suemune |author9=Yasuyuki Shimohigashi |author10=Yukihiro Shoyama | title= Morphine Metabolism in the Opium Poppy and Its Possible Physiological Function | journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume=276 | issue=41 | pages=38179–38184| date=October 12, 2001 | pmid= 11498543| url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M107105200 | doi=10.1074/jbc.M107105200 |display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmazeutische-zeitung.de/index.php?id=titel_16_2004 |title=Dem Morphin auf der Spur |publisher=Pharmazeutische-zeitung.de |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref> The process continued until 1817, when Sertürner published the isolation of pure [[morphine]] from opium after at least thirteen years of research and a nearly disastrous trial on himself and three boys.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Huxtable Ryan J. |author2=Schwartz Stephen K.

Morphine was the first pharmaceutical isolated from a natural product, and this success encouraged the isolation of other alkaloids: by 1820, isolations of [[noscapine]], [[strychnine]], [[veratrine]], [[colchicine]], [[caffeine]], and [[quinine]] were reported. Morphine sales began in 1827, by [[Heinrich Emanuel Merck]] of Darmstadt, and helped him expand his family pharmacy into the [[Merck KGaA]] pharmaceutical company.

[[Codeine]] was isolated in 1832 by [[Pierre Jean Robiquet]].

The use of [[diethyl ether]] and [[chloroform]] for [[general anesthesia]] began in 1846–1847, and rapidly displaced the use of opiates and [[tropane]] alkaloids from [[Solanaceae]] due to their relative safety.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Carter AJ |title=Narcosis and nightshade |journal=The BMJ |volume=313 |issue=7072 |pages=1630–2 |year=1996 |pmid=8991015 |pmc=2359130 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/313/7072/1630 |doi=10.1136/bmj.313.7072.1630 }}</ref>

[[Heroin]], the first semi-synthetic opioid, was first synthesized in 1874, but was not pursued until its rediscovery in 1897 by [[Felix Hoffmann]] at the [[Bayer]] pharmaceutical company in [[Elberfeld, Germany]]. From 1898 to 1910 heroin was marketed as a non-addictive morphine substitute and cough medicine for children. Because the lethal dose of heroin was viewed as a hundred times greater than its effective dose, heroin was advertised as a safer alternative to other opioids.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Heroin Addiction|last=Judson|first=Horace F|publisher=Vintage Books|year=1974|isbn=978-0-394-72017-3|location=|pages=54}}</ref> By 1902, sales made up 5 percent of the company's profits, and "heroinism" had attracted media attention.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://opioids.com/heroin/heroinhistory.html|title=How aspirin turned hero|author1=Richard Askwith |author2=''The Sunday Times'' |date=September 13, 1998|accessdate=May 2, 2007}}</ref> [[Oxycodone]], a [[thebaine]] derivative similar to [[codeine]], was introduced by Bayer in 1916 and promoted as a less-addictive analgesic. Preparations of the drug such as [[oxycodone/paracetamol|oxycodone with paracetamol]] and [[extended release]] oxycodone remain popular to this day.

A range of synthetic [[opioids]] such as [[methadone]] (1937), [[pethidine]] (1939), [[fentanyl]] (late 1950s), and derivatives thereof have been introduced, and each is preferred for certain specialized applications. Nonetheless, morphine remains the drug of choice for American [[combat medic]]s, who carry packs of [[syrette]]s containing 16 milligrams each for use on severely wounded soldiers.<ref name="MOLLE">{{cite web|url=http://www.brooksidepress.org/Products/OperationalMedicine/DATA/operationalmed/Manuals/FMSS/MOLLEMEDICALBAG.htm|title=Operational Medicine 2001 Field Medical Service School Student Handbook: Molle medical bag/surgical instrument set|date=December 7, 1999|accessdate=June 27, 2007}}</ref> No drug has been found that can match the painkilling effect of [[opioid]]s without also duplicating much of their addictive potential.

=== ''Papaver somniferum'' ===
{{Main article|Papaver somniferum}}

Opium poppies are popular and attractive garden plants, whose flowers vary greatly in color, size and form. A modest amount of domestic cultivation in private gardens is not usually subject to legal controls. In part, this tolerance reflects variation in addictive potency. A cultivar for opium production, ''Papaver somniferum L. elite'', contains 91.2 percent morphine, codeine, and thebaine in its latex alkaloids, whereas in the latex of the condiment cultivar "Marianne", these three alkaloids total only 14.0 percent. The remaining alkaloids in the latter cultivar are primarily [[narcotoline]] and [[noscapine]].<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Frick S, Kramell R, Schmidt J, Fist AJ, Kutchan TM |title=Comparative qualitative and quantitative determination of alkaloids in narcotic and condiment Papaver somniferum cultivars|journal=Journal of Natural Products|date=May 2005|volume=68|issue=5|pages=666–73|pmid=15921406|doi=10.1021/np0496643}}</ref>

Seed capsules can be dried and used for decorations, but they also contain morphine, codeine, and other alkaloids. These pods can be boiled in water to produce a bitter tea that induces a long-lasting intoxication ''(See [[Poppy tea]])''. If allowed to mature, poppy pods ([[poppy straw]]) can be crushed and used to produce lower quantities of [[morphinans]]. In poppies subjected to mutagenesis and selection on a mass scale, researchers have been able to use poppy straw to obtain large quantities of [[oripavine]], a precursor to [[opioids]] and antagonists such as [[naltrexone]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patentlens.com/patentlens/patsearch.cgi?patnum=US+6723894#show|title=Production of thebaine and oripavine|date=April 20, 2004|accessdate=May 10, 2007}}</ref> Although millennia older, the production of poppy head decoctions can be seen as a quick and dirty variant of the Kábáy poppy straw process, which since its publication in 1930 has become the major method of obtaining licit opium alkaloids worldwide, as discussed under the Wikipedia [[Morphine]] article.

[[Poppy seed]]s are a common and flavorsome topping for breads and cakes. One gram of poppy seeds contains up to 33 micrograms of morphine and 14 micrograms of codeine, and the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] in the [[United States]] formerly mandated that all drug screening laboratories use a standard cutoff of 300 nanograms per milliliter in urine samples.

=== Harvesting and processing ===

[[File:Harvesting opium.jpg|thumb|left|Harvesting opium]]

When grown for opium production, the skin of the ripening pods of these poppies is scored by a sharp blade at a time carefully chosen so that rain, wind, and dew cannot spoil the exudation of white, milky [[latex]], usually in the afternoon. Incisions are made while the pods are still raw, with no more than a slight yellow tint, and must be shallow to avoid penetrating hollow inner chambers or ''loculi'' while cutting into the lactiferous vessels. In Indian Subcontinent, Afghanistan, Central Asia and Iran, the special tool used to make the incisions is called a ''nushtar'' or "nishtar" (from [[Persian language|Persian]], meaning a lancet) and carries three or four blades three millimeters apart, which are scored upward along the pod. Incisions are made three or four times at intervals of two to three days, and each time the "poppy tears", which dry to a sticky brown resin, are collected the following morning. One acre harvested in this way can produce three to five kilograms of raw opium.<ref name="opioids.com">{{cite web|url=http://opioids.com/narcotic-drugs/chapter-2.html|author=Anil Aggrawal |authorlink=Anil Aggrawal |title=Narcotic Drugs |year=1995}}</ref> In the [[Soviet Union]], pods were typically scored horizontally, and opium was collected three times, or else one or two collections were followed by isolation of opiates from the ripe capsules. Oil poppies, an alternative strain of ''P. somniferum'', were also used for production of opiates from their capsules and stems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1969-01-01_4_page002.html|title=Cultivation of opium poppy and the oil poppy in the Soviet Union}}</ref> A traditional Chinese method of harvesting opium latex involved cutting off the heads and piercing them with a coarse needle then collecting the dried opium 24 to 48 hours later.

Raw opium may be sold to a merchant or broker on the black market, but it usually does not travel far from the field before it is refined into '''morphine base''', because pungent, jelly-like raw opium is bulkier and harder to smuggle. Crude laboratories in the field are capable of refining opium into morphine base by a simple [[acid-base extraction]]. A sticky, brown paste, morphine base is pressed into bricks and sun-dried, and can either be smoked, prepared into other forms or processed into heroin.<ref name="Frontline" />

Other methods of preparation (besides smoking), include processing into regular opium [[tincture]] (''tinctura opii''), [[laudanum]], [[paregoric]] (''tinctura opii camphorata''), [[herbal wine]] (e.g., ''vinum opii''), opium powder (''pulvis opii''), opium [[sirup]] (''sirupus opii'') and opium extract (''extractum opii'').<ref name=Belgische>Belgische Farmacopee, 5de uitgave, 1966; part 3</ref> Vinum opii is made by combining sugar, [[white wine]], [[cinnamon]], and [[cloves]]. Opium syrup is made by combining 997.5 part sugar syrup with 2.5 parts opium extract. Opium extract (''extractum opii'') finally can be made by macerating raw opium with water. To make opium extract, 20 parts water are combined with 1 part raw opium which has been boiled for 5 minutes (the latter to ease mixing).<ref name=Belgische />

Heroin is widely preferred because of increased potency. One study in postaddicts found heroin to be approximately 2.2 times more potent than [[morphine]] by weight with a similar duration; at these relative quantities, they could distinguish the drugs subjectively but had no preference.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=W.

In 2002, the price for one kilogram of opium was {{US$|300}} for the farmer, {{US$|800}} for purchasers in Afghanistan, and {{US$|16,000}} on the streets of Europe before conversion into heroin.<ref name="2002abc">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/content/2005/s1379788.htm|title=Afghanistan: America's blind eye|author=Mark Corcoran|accessdate=May 11, 2007}}</ref>

Afghanistan is currently the primary producer of the drug. After regularly producing 70 percent of the world's opium, Afghanistan decreased production to 74 tons per year under a ban by the [[Taliban]] in 2000, a move which cut production by 94 percent. A year later, after American and British troops invaded Afghanistan, removed the Taliban and installed the interim government, the land under cultivation leapt back to {{convert|285|sqmi|km2}}, with Afghanistan supplanting Burma to become the world's largest opium producer once more. Opium production in that country has increased rapidly since, reaching an all-time high in 2006. According to [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] statistics, Afghanistan's production of oven-dried opium increased to 1,278 tons in 2002, more than doubled by 2003, and nearly doubled again during 2004. In late 2004, the U.S. government estimated that 206,000 hectares were under poppy cultivation, 4.5 percent of the country's total cropland, and produced 4,200 metric tons of opium, 76 percent of the world's supply, yielding 60 percent of Afghanistan's gross domestic product.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/locations/asia_near_east/afghanistan/weeklyreports/022405_report.html|title=Rebuilding Afghanistan: Weekly Activity Update|date=February 24, 2005|accessdate=May 11, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070509070349/http://www.usaid.gov/locations/asia_near_east/afghanistan/weeklyreports/022405_report.html |archivedate = May 9, 2007}}</ref> In 2006, the [[UN Office on Drugs and Crime]] estimated production to have risen 59 percent to {{convert|407000|acre|ha|order=flip}} in cultivation, yielding 6,100 tons of opium, 82 percent of the world's supply.<ref>{{cite news|author=BBC News|date=August 2, 2006|title=UN warns of soaring Afghan opium |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5308180.stm|accessdate=June 6, 2007}}</ref> The value of the resulting heroin was estimated at {{US$|3.5{{nbsp}}billion}}, of which Afghan farmers were estimated to have received {{US$|700{{nbsp}}million}} in revenue.

An increasingly large fraction of opium is processed into morphine base and heroin in drug labs in Afghanistan. Despite an international set of chemical controls designed to restrict availability of [[acetic anhydride]], it enters the country, perhaps through its Central Asian neighbors which do not participate. A counternarcotics law passed in December 2005 requires Afghanistan to develop registries or regulations for tracking, storing, and owning acetic anhydride.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/p/inl/rls/nrcrpt/2006/vol1/html/62105.htm |title=International Narcotics Control Strategy Report: Chemical controls |accessdate=May 11, 2007}}</ref>

Besides Afghanistan, smaller quantities of opium are produced in Pakistan, the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] region of Southeast Asia (particularly [[Burma]]), Colombia, Guatemala, and Mexico.

Chinese production mainly trades with and profits from North America. In 2002, they were seeking to expand through eastern United States. In the post 9/11 era, trading between borders became difficult and because new international laws were set into place, the opium trade became more diffused. Power shifted from remote to high-end smugglers and opium traders. Outsourcing became a huge factor for survival for many smugglers and opium farmers.<ref>Brzezinski, Matthew. "Re-Engineering the Drug Business". ''The New York Times Magazine'', June 23, 2002</ref>

In South American countries, opium poppies are technically illegal, but nonetheless appear in some nurseries as ornamentals.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

=== Legal production ===
{{Main article|Opium licensing}}

Legal opium production is allowed under the [[United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] and other international drug treaties, subject to strict supervision by the [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]] of individual countries. The leading legal production method is the [[Gregory process]], whereby the entire poppy, excluding roots and leaves, is mashed and stewed in dilute acid solutions. The [[alkaloids]] are then recovered via [[acid-base extraction]] and purified. This process was developed in the UK during World War II, when wartime shortages of many [[Essential Drugs|essential drugs]] encouraged innovation in [[Reed Business Information|pharmaceutical processing]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

[[Legal opium production in India]] is much more traditional. As of 2008, opium was collected by farmers who were licensed to grow {{convert|0.1|ha|acre}} of opium poppies, who to maintain their licences needed to sell 56 kilograms of unadulterated raw opium paste. The price of opium paste is fixed by the government according to the quality and quantity tendered. The average is around 1500 rupees ({{US$|29}}) per kilogram.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbn.nic.in|title=CENTRAL BUREAU OF NARCOTICS, INDIA|date=|work=cbn.nic.in|accessdate=April 4, 2016}}</ref> Some additional money is made by drying the poppy heads and collecting poppy seeds, and a small fraction of opium beyond the quota may be consumed locally or diverted to the black market. The opium paste is dried and processed into government opium and alkaloid factories before it is packed into cases of 60 kilograms for export. Purification of chemical constituents is done in India for domestic production, but typically done abroad by foreign importers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ieo.org/opm_mass.html|title=Opium for the masses: photo essay on cultivation of opium in India|author=Pablo Bartholomew |authorlink=Pablo Bartholomew |year=1996|accessdate=June 15, 2007}}</ref>

A recent{{when|date=September 2013}} proposal from the European [[Senlis Council]] hopes to solve the problems caused by the large quantity of [[Opium production in Afghanistan|opium produced illegally in Afghanistan]], most of which is converted to heroin and smuggled for sale in Europe and the United States.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} This proposal is to [[opium licensing|license]] Afghan farmers to produce opium for the world pharmaceutical market, and thereby solve another problem, that of chronic underuse of potent analgesics where required within [[developing country|developing nations]]. Part of the proposal is to overcome the "80–20 rule" that requires the U.S. to purchase 80 percent of its legal opium from India and Turkey to include Afghanistan, by establishing a second-tier system of supply control that complements the current INCB regulated supply and demand system by providing poppy-based medicines to countries who cannot meet their demand under the current regulations. Senlis arranged a conference in Kabul that brought drug policy experts from around the world to meet with Afghan government officials to discuss internal security, corruption issues, and legal issues within Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.senliscouncil.net/modules/events/kabul|title=The Kabul International Symposium on Drug Policy|author=Senlis Council|date=September 26, 2005|accessdate=May 4, 2007}}</ref>
In June 2007, the Council launched a "Poppy for Medicines" project that provides a technical blueprint for the implementation of an integrated control system within Afghan village-based poppy for medicine projects: the idea promotes the economic diversification by redirecting proceeds from the legal cultivation of poppy and production of poppy-based medicines (See [[Senlis Council]]).<ref name="senliscouncil">[http://www.senliscouncil.net/modules/publications/documents/poppy_medicine_technical_dossier Poppy for Medicine: "Licensing poppy for the production of essential medicines: an integrated counter-narcotics, development, and counter-insurgency model for Afghanistan"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928073343/http://www.senliscouncil.net/modules/publications/documents/poppy_medicine_technical_dossier |date=September 28, 2007 }}.

=== Cultivation in the UK ===

In late 2006, the British government permitted the pharmaceutical company [[MacFarlan Smith]] (a [[Johnson Matthey]] company) to cultivate opium poppies in England for medicinal reasons, after Macfarlan Smith's primary source, India, decided to increase the price of export opium latex. This move is well received by British farmers, with a major opium poppy field located in [[Didcot]], England. The British government has contradicted the Home Office's suggestion that opium cultivation can be legalized in Afghanistan for exports to the United Kingdom, helping lower poverty and internal fighting while helping the [[National Health Service|NHS]] to meet the high demand for [[morphine]] and heroin. Opium poppy cultivation in the United Kingdom does not need a licence, but a licence is required for those wishing to extract opium for medicinal products.<ref>The painkilling fields: England's opium poppies that tackle the NHS morphine crisis, [http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23404311-details/The%20painkilling%20fields:%20England's%20opium%20poppies%20that%20tackle%20the%20NHS%20morphine%20crisis/article.do Press release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010224932/https://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23404311-details/The%20painkilling%20fields%3A%20England%27s%20opium%20poppies%20that%20tackle%20the%20NHS%20morphine%20crisis/article.do |date=October 10, 2008 }}, September 15, 2007.</ref>

=== Consumption ===

[[File:Akha man with opium pipe.jpg|thumb|right|An [[Akha people|Akha]] man smokes a pipe containing opium mixed with tobacco]]

In the industrialized world, the United States is the world's biggest consumer of prescription opioids, with Italy one of the lowest because of tighter regulations on prescribing narcotics for pain relief.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nursinglibrary.org/Portal/main.aspx?pageid=4024&sid=15718|title=Oral morphine consumption in Italy and Sicily|author=S.

[[Intravenous injection]] of opiates is most used: by comparison with injection, "dragon chasing" (heating of heroin with [[barbital]] on a piece of foil), and [[madak]] and "ack ack" (smoking of cigarettes containing tobacco mixed with heroin powder) are only 40 percent and 20 percent efficient, respectively.<ref>{{cite journal|title=An Assessment Of Inhalation As A Mode Of Administration Of Heroin By Addicts|url=http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/154/1/142|author1=Benjamin Pui-Nin Mo |author2=E.

The smoking of opium does not involve the [[pyrolysis|burning]] of the material as might be imagined. Rather, the prepared opium is indirectly heated to temperatures at which the active alkaloids, chiefly morphine, are vaporized. In the past, smokers would use a specially designed [[opium pipe]] which had a removable knob-like pipe-bowl of fired earthenware attached by a metal fitting to a long, cylindrical stem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opiummuseum.com/|title=The Opium Museum}}</ref> A small "pill" of opium about the size of a pea would be placed on the pipe-bowl, which was then heated by holding it over an [[opium lamp]], a special oil lamp with a distinct funnel-like chimney to channel heat into a small area. The smoker would lie on his or her side in order to guide the pipe-bowl and the tiny pill of opium over the stream of heat rising from the chimney of the oil lamp and inhale the vaporized opium fumes as needed. Several pills of opium were smoked at a single session depending on the smoker's tolerance to the drug. The effects could last up to twelve hours.

In [[Eastern world|Eastern culture]], opium is more commonly used in the form of [[paregoric]] to treat [[diarrhea]]. This is a weaker solution than [[laudanum]], an alcoholic tincture which was prevalently used as a pain medication and sleeping aid. Tincture of opium has been prescribed for, among other things, severe diarrhea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drugs.uta.edu/laudanum.html|title=Laudanum|accessdate=May 4, 2007}}</ref> Taken thirty minutes prior to meals, it significantly slows intestinal motility, giving the intestines greater time to absorb fluid in the stool.

Despite the historically negative view of opium as a cause of addiction, the use of morphine and other derivatives isolated from opium in the treatment of chronic pain has been reestablished. If given in controlled doses, modern opiates can be an effective treatment for [[neuropathic pain]] and other forms of chronic pain.<ref name="BallantyneJane">Ballantyne, Jane C., and Jianren Mao.

Opium contains two main groups of [[alkaloid]]s. [[Phenanthrene]]s such as [[morphine]], [[codeine]], and [[thebaine]] are the main psychoactive constituents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.homehealth-uk.com/medical/professional_drugtests_opiates.htm |title=Opiates |publisher=Homehealth-uk.com |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref> [[Isoquinolines]] such as [[papaverine]] and [[noscapine]] have no significant [[central nervous system]] effects, and are not regulated under the [[Controlled Substances Act]]. Morphine is the most prevalent and important alkaloid in opium, consisting of 10–16 percent of the total, and is responsible for most of its harmful effects such as [[lung edema]], respiratory difficulties, coma, or cardiac or respiratory collapse. Morphine binds to and activates [[mu opioid receptor]] in the brain, spinal cord, stomach and intestine. Regular use can lead to [[drug tolerance]] or [[physical dependence]].
