Tipifarnib is an experimental drug in development for the treatment of certain kinds of cancer. It is a small-molecule inhibitor of the enzyme, [[farnesyltransferase]], and a member of a class of drug candidates called [[Farnesyltransferase inhibitor|farnesyltransferase inhibitors]]. Tipifarnib was originally developed by Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, an affiliate of Johnson & Johnson, and was licensed in 2014 to Kura Oncology for further development in oncology.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/03/12/714635/10124430/en/Kura-Oncology-Announces-License-Agreement-With-Janssen-Pharmaceutica-for-Development-and-Commercialization-of-Tipifarnib-Closes-60-Million-Private-Placement-and-Completes-Reverse-M.html|title=Kura Oncology Announces License Agreement With Janssen Pharmaceutica for Development and Commercialization of Tipifarnib; Closes $60 Million Private Placement and Completes Reverse Merger|last=Inc.|first=Kura Oncology,|work=GlobeNewswire News Room|access-date=2017-10-16|language=en-US}}</ref> Kura Oncology's license was expanded to all therapeutic areas other than virology in 2016. 

==Molecular Mechanism of Action==
Many proteins involved in cellular signaling must be associated with other proteins at the inner cellular membrane of the tumor cell to function properly. The enzyme farnesyltransferase catalyzes the attachment of a 15-carbon isoprenoid unit of the carboxyl terminus of a protein, facilitating association with the cell membrane.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reid|first=TS|last2=Terry|first2=KL|last3=Casey|first3=PJ|last4=Beese|first4=LS|date=October 2004|title=Crystallographic analysis of CaaX prenyltransferases compelxed with substrates defines rules of protein substrate selectivity|url=|journal=J. Mol. Biol.|volume=343|pages=417-433|via=}}</ref> 

Tipifarnib blocks activity of the farnesyltransferase enzyme. Treatment of tumors with tipifarnib results in the reversal of several hallmarks of cancer, including mitotic arrest, induction of apoptosis, growth inhibition, invasion, angiogenesis and tumor growth, as well as induction of tumor regression in animal models.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=et al.|date=April 2015|title=Targeting RAS membrane Association: Back to the Future for Anti-RAS Drug Discovery?|url=|journal=Clin.

==Activity in HRAS Mutant Solid Tumors==
One gene implicated in the development and progression of certain tumors is HRAS (Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wong-Staal|first=F|last2=Dallas-Favera|first2=R|last3=Franchini|first3=G|last4=Gelmann|first4=EP|last5=Gallo|first5=RC|date=July 1981|title=Three distinct genes in human DNA related to the transforming genes of mammalian sarcoma retroviruses|url=|journal=Science|volume=213|pages=226-228|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Russell|first=MW|date=July 1996|title=A 500-kb physical map and contig from the Harvey ras-1 gene to the 11p telomere|url=|journal=genomics|volume=35|pages=353-360|via=}}</ref> HRAS is a proto-oncogene, which is a normal gene that can become an oncogene due to mutations or increased expression. HRAS is mutated and/or over-expressed in certain tumors. 

The HRAS protein is localized in the plasma membrane and is an early player in many signal transduction pathways. In certain tumors, mutations in HRAS or its upstream regulators result in persistent activation of downstream growth and proliferation signals that drive tumor cell growth.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2017-08-31|title=HRAS|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=HRAS&oldid=798192316|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}</ref> 

The HRAS protein requires farnesylation for its association with the cellular membrane and proper function. Tipifarnib prevents the farnesylation of the HRAS protein, and, thus, it has the potential for therapeutic benefit by blocking the activity of tumors that are driven by mutant HRAS. 

== Clinical Development ==
Tipifarnib was initially developed by Janssen and has been studied in more than 5,000 patients. It was observed to be generally well tolerated with a manageable side-effect profile as a single agent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kuraoncology.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Alan-Ho-MD-TAT2017.pdf|title=Preliminary evidence of clinical activity with tipifarnib in

In clinical studies in the late 1990s and early 2000s, tipifarnib demonstrated a well-established safety profile and durable anti-cancer activity in certain patients. Johnson and Johnson submitted an application to FDA for approval of tipifarnib in elderly patients with newly-diagnosed poor-risk acute myeloid leukemia, but it received a non-approvable letter in 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/05/briefing/2005-4138B1_01_J&J-Briefing-Document.pdf|title=Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development, L.L.C.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.firstwordpharma.com/node/192918#axzz4vFU5xrdV|title=FDA rejects Johnson & Johnson's application of tipifarnib as AML treatment|website=www.firstwordpharma.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-16}}</ref> 

Although tipifarnib demonstrated evidence of clinical benefit, it was never studied in a genetically-enriched patient population. Clinical and preclinical data suggest that, in certain selected patient populations, tipifarnib has the potential to provide significant benefit to cancer patients with limited treatment options.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kuraoncology.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Alan-Ho-MD-TAT2017.pdf|title=Preliminary evidence of clinical activity with tipifarnib in

Since in-licensing tipifarnib from Janssen in 2014, Kura Oncology has undertaken an effort to identify biomarkers associated with the activity of tipifarnib that could help to identify those patients most likely to benefit from treatment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ir.kuraoncology.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=253913&p=irol-newsArticle&cat=news&id=2299307|title=Press Releases - Investor Relations - Kura Oncology|website=ir.kuraoncology.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-16}}</ref> The company is currently studying the drug candidate in multiple Phase 2 clinical trials. 

In July 2017, Kura Oncology announced that the United States Patent and Trademark Office had issued U.S. Patent No. [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=9707221.PN.&OS=PN/9707221&RS=PN/9707221 9,707,221], entitled, "Methods of Treating Cancer Patients with Farnesyltransferase Inhibitors." The patent includes multiple claims directed to the use of tipifarnib in patients with HRAS mutant squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and has an expiration date of August 2036, excluding any possible patent term extension.

In September 2017, Kura Oncology announced positive top-line results from a Phase 2 trial for tipifarnib in patients with HRAS mutant relapsed or refractory squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/brief-kura-oncology-announces-positive-p/brief-kura-oncology-announces-positive-phase-2-study-for-tipifarnib-in-hras-mutant-head-and-neck-cancer-idUSFWN1LO0U5|title=BRIEF-Kura Oncology announces positive phase 2 study for Tipifarnib in HRAS mutant head and neck cancer|date=2017-09-07|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-10-16}}</ref>
