'''Alemtuzumab''' is a [[pharmaceutical drug|drug]] used in the treatment of [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]] (CLL), [[cutaneous T-cell lymphoma]] (CTCL) and [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma|T-cell lymphoma]] under the trade names '''Campath''', '''MabCampath''' and '''Campath-1H''', and in the treatment of [[multiple sclerosis]] as '''Lemtrada'''. It is also used in some conditioning regimens for [[bone marrow transplantation]], [[kidney transplantation]] and [[islet cell transplantation]].

It is a [[monoclonal antibody]] that binds to [[CD52]], a protein present on the surface of mature [[lymphocyte]]s, but not on the [[stem cell]]s from which these lymphocytes are derived. After treatment with alemtuzumab, these CD52-bearing lymphocytes are targeted for destruction.

Alemtuzumab is used as second-line therapy for CLL. It was approved by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] for CLL patients who have been treated with [[alkylating antineoplastic agent|alkylating agent]]s and who have failed [[fludarabine]] therapy. It has been approved by [[Health Canada]] for the same indication, and additionally for CLL patients who have not had any previous therapies.

(Mab)Campath was withdrawn from the markets in the US and Europe in 2012 to prepare for a higher-priced relaunch of Lemtrada aimed at multiple sclerosis.<ref name=pt/>

A complication of therapy with alemtuzumab is that it significantly increases the risk for [[opportunistic infection]]s, in particular, reactivation of [[cytomegalovirus]].

== Medical uses ==

===Chronic lymphocytic leukemia===
Alemtuzumab is indicated for the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) in patients who have been treated with alkylating agents and who have failed fludarabine therapy. It is an unconjugated antibody, thought to work via the activation of [[antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity]] (ADCC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.campath.com/hcp/AboutCampath.html |title=About Campath |publisher=Genzyme |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714063804/http://www.campath.com/hcp/AboutCampath.html |archivedate=2011-07-14 }}</ref>

===Multiple sclerosis===
In 2008 early tests at [[Cambridge University]] suggest that alemtuzumab might be useful in treating and even reversing the effects of [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn15023-drug-reboots-immune-system-to-reverse-ms.html|title=Drug reboots immune system to reverse MS|author=Andy Coghlan|publisher=[[New Scientist]] News Service|date=23 October 2008}}</ref> Promising results were reported in 2011 from a phase III trial against [[interferon beta 1a]]. 

In September 2013 alemtuzumab was approved for first-line use in the EU.

In November 2013, the US FDA issued a comprehensive briefing on alemtuzumab for an agency review meeting.  The document highlighted numerous serious safety and efficacy concerns, including substantial doubts about the adequacy of relevant clinical trials.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/PeripheralandCentralNervousSystemDrugsAdvisoryCommittee/UCM374186.pdf | format=PDF | title=Alemtuzumab (BLA 103948\5139) Background Package | publisher=[[Center for Drug Evaluation and Research]] | location=United States | website=Advisory Committees | date=13 November 2013 }}</ref> In December 2013, the US FDA indicated that the Lemtrada application is not ready for approval, due to lack of evidence from "adequate and well-controlled studies" that demonstrate that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20131229005024/en/Genzyme-Receives-Complete-Response-Letter-FDA-Lemtrada%E2%84%A2#.UsEM3fT-iSo|title=Genzyme Receives Complete Response Letter from FDA on Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) Application|publisher=BusinessWire|date=30 December 2013}}</ref> The CEO of Genzyme, David Meeker, strongly disagreed with this decision and indicated that the company would file an appeal.

In November 2014, Alemtuzumab was finally approved by the FDA<ref>FDA approves Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/285580.php]</ref>

On December 1, 2014 the first treatments with Lemtrada (or alemtuzumab) were administered to the first patients outside clinical trials. Dr. Christopher LaGanke was the attending physician and was also instrumental in having the FDA reconsider the approval.<ref>Newly approved multiple sclerosis drug given to first U.S. patients today in Cullman [http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2014/12/newly_approved_multiple_sclero.html#incart_river]</ref>

== Contraindications ==
Alemtuzumab is contraindicated in patients who have active systemic infections, underlying immunodeficiency (e.g., seropositive for HIV), or known Type I hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions to the substance.

== Adverse effects==
Alemtuzumab has been associated with infusion-related events including hypotension, rigors, fever, shortness of breath, bronchospasm, chills, and/or rash <ref>https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm082681.htm</ref>.

It can also precipitate [[autoimmune disease]] through the suppression of [[suppressor T cell]] populations and/or the emergence of autoreactive B-cells.<ref name=Costelloe2012>{{cite journal|last=Costelloe|first=L|author2=Jones J|author3=Coles A|title=Secondary autoimmune diseases following alemtuzumab therapy for multiple sclerosis|journal=Expert Rev Neurother|date=March 2012|volume=12|issue=3|pages=335–41|doi=10.1586/ern.12.5|pmid=22364332}}</ref><ref name=Aranha2013>{{cite journal|last=Aranha|first=AA|author2=Amer S|author3=Reda ES|author4=Broadley SA|author5=Davoren PM|title=Autoimmune Thyroid Disease in the Use of Alemtuzumab for Multiple Sclerosis: A Review|journal=Endocrine Practice|date=Jun 11, 2013|volume=19|pages=1–25|doi=10.4158/EP13020.RA|pmid=23757618|issue=5}}</ref>

== Biochemical properties ==
Alemtuzumab is a recombinant DNA-derived humanized [[IgG1]] kappa monoclonal antibody that is directed against the 21–28 kDa cell surface glycoprotein [[CD52]].<ref name="Klement">{{cite journal| author = A. Klement| date = 7 January 2014| title = Multiple-Sklerose-Behandlung| journal = Österreichische Apothekerzeitung| issue = 1/2014| page = 24f| language = German}}</ref>

===Antiviral properties===

In an in-vitro experiment, it has been shown that Alemtuzumab has antiviral properties against [[HIV-1]]<ref>Ruxrungtham K, Sirivichayakul S, Buranapraditkun S, Krause W. Alemtuzumab-induced elimination of HIV-1-infected immune cells. Journal of Virus Eradication. 2016;2(1):12-18.</ref>

== History ==
The origins of alemtuzumab date back to ''Campath-1'' which was derived from the rat antibodies raised against human lymphocyte proteins by [[Herman Waldmann]] and colleagues in 1983.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Removal of T cells from bone marrow for transplantation: a monoclonal antilymphocyte antibody that fixes human complement|journal=Blood|date=October 1983|volume=62|issue=4|pages=873–82|pmid=6349718|vauthors=Hale G, Bright S, Chumbley G |display-authors=etal}}</ref> The name "Campath" derives from the ''path''ology department of [[University of Cambridge|''Cam''bridge University]].

Initially, Campath-1 was not ideal for therapy because patients could, in theory, react against the foreign rat protein determinants of the antibody. To circumvent this problem, [[Greg Winter]] and his colleagues humanised Campath-1, by extracting the [[Complementarity determining region|hypervariable loops]] that had specificity for CD52 and grafting them onto a human antibody framework. This became known as Campath-1H and serves as the basis for alemtuzumab.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Riechmann|first1=Lutz|last2=Clark|first2=Michael|last3=Waldmann|first3=Herman|last4=Winter|first4=Greg|title=Reshaping human antibodies for therapy|journal=Nature|volume=332|issue=6162|year=1988|pages=323–327|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/332323a0|pmid=3127726}}</ref>

While alemtuzumab started life as a laboratory tool for understanding the immune system, within a short time it was clinically investigated for use to improve the success of bone marrow transplants and as a treatment for leukaemia, lymphoma, vasculitis, organ transplants, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whatisbiotechnology.org/exhibitions/campath|title=The life story of a biotechnology drug: Alemtuzumab|publisher=What is Biotechnology?}}</ref>

Campath as medication was first approved for B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 2001. It is marketed by [[Genzyme]], which acquired the world-wide rights from [[Bayer AG]] in 2009. Genzyme was bought by [[Sanofi]] in 2011. In August/September 2012 Campath was withdrawn from the markets in the US and Europe. This was done to prevent [[off-label use]] of the drug to treat multiple sclerosis and to prepare for a relaunch under the trade name ''Lemtrada'', with a different dosage aimed at multiple sclerosis treatment, this is expected to be much higher-priced.<ref name=pt>{{cite news | title=Sanofi withdraws Campath in US and EU | author=McKee, Selina | date=21 August 2012 | work=Pharma Times Online | publisher=Pharma Times | url=http://www.pharmatimes.com/Article/12-08-21/Sanofi_withdraws_Campath_in_US_and_EU.aspx }}</ref>

Bayer reserves the right to co promote Lemtrada for 5 years, with the option to renew for an additional five years.

=== Sanofi acquisition and change of license controversy===
In February 2011, Sanofi-Aventis, since renamed [[Sanofi]], acquired Genzyme, the manufacturer of alemtuzumab.<ref>{{cite news | title=Sanofi Buys Genzyme for over $20 billion | date=17 February 2011 | author=Whalen, Jeanne | author2=Spencer, Mimosa | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703373404576147483489656732 | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] }}{{paywall}}</ref>  The acquisition was delayed by a dispute between the two companies regarding the value of alemtuzumab.  The dispute was settled by the issuance of Contingent Value Rights, a type of stock warrant which pays a dividend only if alemtuzumab reaches certain sales targets.  The contingent value rights (CVR) trade on the NASDAQ-GM market with the ticker symbol GCVRZ.

In August 2012, Genzyme surrendered the licence for all presentations of alemtuzumab,<ref>{{cite web | title=Discontinuation of licensed supplies of alemtuzumab (Mabcampath) | author=Hussein, Jasmin (Genzyme) | url=http://www.medicinesresources.nhs.uk/upload/documents/News/2012/Sanofil%20letter.pdf | format=pdf | publisher=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence | location=United Kingdom | date=9 August 2012 }}</ref> pending regulatory approval to re-introduce it as a treatment for [[multiple sclerosis]]. Concerns<ref>{{cite news|title=Multiple sclerosis: New drug 'most effective'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-20151891|accessdate=1 November 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=1 November 2012}}</ref> that Genzyme would later bring to market the same product at a much higher price proved correct.

==Research and off-label use==

===Graft-versus-host disease===
A 2009 retrospective study of alemtuzumab (10 mg IV weekly) in 20 patients (no controls) with severe steroid-resistant acute intestinal [[graft-versus-host disease]] after allogeneic [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]] (HSCT) demonstrated improvement. Overall response rate was 70%, with complete response in 35%.<ref name=Schn2009/> In this study, the median survival was 280 days.  Important complications following this treatment included [[cytomegalovirus]] reactivation, bacterial infection, and invasive [[aspergillosis]] infection.<ref name=Schn2009>{{cite journal | url=http://www.bbmt.org/article/S1083-8791(09)00186-4/abstract | title=Successful treatment of severe acute intestinal graft-versus-host resistant to systemic and topical steroids with alemtuzumab | author=Schnitzler, Marc | author2=Hasskarl, Jens | author3=Egger, Matthias | author4=Bertz, Hartmut | author5=Finke, Jürgen | display-authors=3 | journal=Bio.
