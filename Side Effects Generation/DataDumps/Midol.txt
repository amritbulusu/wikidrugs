'''Midol''' is a [[brand]] of an over-the-counter [[drug]] for [[menstrual cramping]] and other effects related to [[premenstrual syndrome]] and [[menstruation]]. Midol is distributed by [[Bayer]].

Midol was originally sold in 1911 as a headache and toothache remedy that was considered safer because it did not use the narcotics typically used at the time.<ref>[http://www.mum.org/midoslog.jpg Midol ad for Headache--Neuralgia, Toothache]</ref> It was then promoted as a cure for hiccups claiming it controlled spasms, and finally as a remedy for menstrual cramps and bloating.<ref>[http://www.mum.org/midol11x.jpg Midol for Hiccoughs]</ref><ref>[http://www.mum.org/news.htm News at Museum of Menstruation and women's health]</ref><ref>[http://contexts.org/socimages/files/2008/07/gender-bettys-gay-with-midol.jpg Midol ad for Menstrual problems]</ref><ref>[http://contexts.org/socimages/files/2008/07/gender-reverse-the-curse.jpg  Midol "Reverse the Curse" ad]</ref> A formulation sold in the 1980s was made with the [[sympathomimetic]] [[cinnamedrine]].<ref>KW Fellows, AJ Giannini.
