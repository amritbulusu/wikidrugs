'''Pramiracetam''' is a [[central nervous system]] [[stimulant]] and [[nootropic]] agent belonging to the [[racetam]] family of drugs.  It is marketed by [[Menarini]] under the brand name '''Pramistar''' as a treatment for memory and attention deficits in aging people with neurodegenerative and vascular dementias in Italy and some Eastern European countries.<ref>AIFA [https://farmaci.agenziafarmaco.gov.it/bancadatifarmaci/farmaco?farmaco=028021 Pramistar authorizations in the Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco Database] Page accessed August 2, 2015.

Pramiracetam was discovered by scientists at [[Parke-Davis]], at that time a division of [[Warner-Lambert]], in the late 1970s; patents expired in 1996. Warner-Lambert conducted clinical trials in Alzheimer's Disease and abandoned that indication after Phase II trials showed mixed results; it then began to develop it as an [[orphan drug]] as an adjunct to [[electroconvulsive therapy]] for [[major depressive disorder]], in part to take advantage of the administrative exclusivity provided by the orphan status.  It licensed European rights to [[Menarini]] which continued developing it for dementias, and in 1991 it licensed US and other non-European rights to Cambridge Neuroscience, Inc, (CNI) which pursued the ECT indication, as well as a use in restoring cognitive function after stroke or [[traumatic brain injury]].<ref name=Pink>Staff, The Pink Sheet.

CNI conducted a clinical trial in 4 people who had cognitive problems following a head injury.  Trials conducted by or on behalf of Menarini and Warner-Lambert included two small trials conducted in [[Ukraine]], one in people with [[cerebrovascular disease]] and another in people with [[concussion]].  Another small trial was performed in Italy, on healthy people in whom amnesia was induced with [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]].<ref>Malykh AG, Sadaie MR.
