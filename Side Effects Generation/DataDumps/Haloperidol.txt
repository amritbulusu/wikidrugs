===Pregnancy and lactation===
Data from [[Animal testing|animal experiments]] indicate haloperidol is not [[teratogenic]], but is embryotoxic in high doses.  In humans, no controlled studies exist.  Reports in pregnant women revealed possible damage to the fetus, although most of the women were exposed to multiple drugs during pregnancy. In addition,  reports indicate neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery, such as agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder. Following accepted general principles, haloperidol should be given during pregnancy only if the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential fetal risk.<ref name="FDA">{{cite web |url=http://www.drugs.com/pro/haldol.html |title=Haldol Official FDA information, side effects and uses |publisher=Drugs.com |accessdate=2013-10-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005001049/http://www.drugs.com/pro/haldol.html |archivedate=2013-10-05 |df= }}</ref>

Haloperidol, when given to lactating women, is found in significant amounts in their milk. Breastfed children sometimes show [[extrapyramidal symptoms]]. If the use of haloperidol during lactation seems indicated, the benefit for the mother should clearly outweigh the risk for the child, or breastfeeding should be stopped.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Other considerations===
[[Image:Haloperidol decanoate highlighting ester group.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Skeletal formula]] of haloperidol decanoate. The decanoate group is highlighted in {{color|red|red}}.]]
During long-term treatment of chronic psychiatric disorders, the daily dose should be reduced to the lowest level needed for maintenance of remission.  Sometimes, it may be indicated to terminate haloperidol treatment gradually.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chemeurope.com/en/encyclopedia/Haloperidol.html|title=Haloperidol at Chemeurope|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612033532/http://www.chemeurope.com/en/encyclopedia/Haloperidol.html|archivedate=2012-06-12|df=}}</ref> In addition, during long-term use, routine monitoring including measurement of BMI, blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, and lipids, is recommended due to the risk of side effects.<ref name="APA schizophrenia guideline" />

Other forms of therapy (psychotherapy, occupational therapy/ergotherapy, or social rehabilitation) should be instituted properly.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}
PET imaging studies have suggested low doses are preferable. Clinical response was associated with at least 65% occupancy of D2 receptors, while greater than 72% was likely to cause hyperprolactinaemia and over 78% associated with extrapyramidal side effects. Doses of haloperidol greater than 5&nbsp;mg increased the risk of side effects without improving efficacy.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/026988110101500403 |title=Determining the optimal dose of haloperidol in first-episode psychosis |year=2001 |last1=Oosthuizen |first1=P. |last2=Emsley |first2=R.

The [[decanoate]] ester of haloperidol (haloperidol decanoate, trade names Haldol decanoate, Halomonth, Neoperidole) has a much longer duration of action, so is often used in people known to be noncompliant with oral medication.

As haloperidol is a high-potency typical antipsychotic, it tends to produce significant [[extrapyramidal side effects]]. According to a 2013 meta-analysis of the comparative efficacy and tolerability of 15 antipsychotic drugs it was the most prone of the 15 for causing extrapyramidal side effects.<ref name = "Lancet">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60733-3 |title=Comparative efficacy and tolerability of 15 antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia: A multiple-treatments meta-analysis |year=2013 |last1=Leucht |first1=Stefan |last2=Cipriani |first2=Andrea |last3=Spineli |first3=Loukia |last4=Mavridis |first4=Dimitris |last5=Örey |first5=Deniz |last6=Richter |first6=Franziska |last7=Samara |first7=Myrto |last8=Barbui |first8=Corrado |last9=Engel |first9=Rolf R |last10=Geddes |first10=John R |last11=Kissling |first11=Werner |last12=Stapf |first12=Marko Paul |last13=Lässig |first13=Bettina |last14=Salanti |first14=Georgia |last15=Davis |first15=John M |journal=The Lancet |volume=382 |issue=9896 |pages=951–62 |pmid=23810019}}</ref>

===Contraindications===
* Pre-existing [[coma]], acute stroke
* Severe intoxication with alcohol or other central depressant drugs
* Known allergy against haloperidol or other butyrophenones or other drug ingredients
* Known heart disease, when combined will tend towards cardiac arrest{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Special cautions===

* Patients at special risk for the development of [[Long QT syndrome|QT prolongation]] ([[hypokalemia]], concomitant use of other drugs causing QT prolongation)
* Impaired [[liver]] function, as haloperidol is metabolized and eliminated mainly by the liver
* In patients with hyperthyreosis, the action of haloperidol is intensified and side effects are more likely.
* IV injections: risk of hypotension or orthostatic collapse
* Patients with a history of leukopenia: a [[complete blood count]] should be monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and discontinuation of the drug should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in white blood cells.<ref name=FDA />
* Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis: analysis of 17 trials showed the risk of death in this group of patients was 1.6 to 1.7 times that of placebo-treated patients.

==Overdose==

===Symptoms===
Symptoms are usually due to side effects. Most often encountered are:
* Severe [[extrapyramidal symptoms|extrapyramidal]] side effects with muscle rigidity and tremors, [[akathisia]], etc.
* [[Hypotension]] or [[hypertension]]
* [[Sedation]]
* [[Anticholinergic]] side effects (dry mouth, constipation, paralytic [[ileus]], difficulties in urinating, decreased [[perspiration]])
* Coma in severe cases, accompanied by respiratory depression and massive hypotension, shock
* Rarely, serious ventricular arrhythmia (''torsades de pointes''), with or without prolonged [[QT-time]]

===Treatment===
Treatment is merely symptomatic and involves intensive care with stabilization of vital functions. In early detected cases of oral overdose, induction of [[emesis]], [[gastric lavage]], and the use of [[activated charcoal]] can all be tried. [[Epinephrine]] is avoided for treatment of hypotension and shock, because its action might be reversed. In the case of a severe overdose, antidotes such as [[bromocryptine]] or [[ropinirole]] may be used to treat the extrapyramidal effects caused by haloperidol, acting as dopamine receptor agonists.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} ECG and vital signs should be monitored especially for QT prolongation and severe arrhythmias should be treated with antiarrhythmic measures.<ref name=FDA />

===Prognosis===
In general, the prognosis of overdose is good, and lasting damage is not known, provided the person has survived the initial phase. An overdose of haloperidol can be fatal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/mtm/haloperidol.html|title=Haloperidol at Drugs.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122170902/http://www.drugs.com/mtm/haloperidol.html|archivedate=2011-11-22|df=}}</ref>

==Pharmacokinetics==

===By mouth===
The bioavailability of oral haloperidol ranges from 60–70%. However, there is a wide variance in reported mean [[Cmax (pharmacology)|T<sub>max</sub>]] and [[Biological half-life|T<sub>1/2</sub>]] in different studies, ranging from 1.7 to 6.1 hours and 14.5 to 36.7 hours respectively.<ref name=PK1999/>

===Intramuscular injections===
The drug is well and rapidly absorbed with a high bioavailability when injected intramuscularly. The T<sub>max</sub> is 20 minutes in healthy individuals and 33.8 minutes in patients with schizophrenia. The mean T<sub>1/2</sub> is 20.7 hours.<ref name=PK1999/> The [[decanoate]] injectable formulation is for intramuscular administration only and is not intended to be used intravenously. The plasma concentrations of haloperidol decanoate reach a peak at about six days after the injection, falling thereafter, with an approximate half-life of three weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/pro/haldol-decanoate.html|title=drugs.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810064415/http://www.drugs.com/pro/haldol-decanoate.html|archivedate=2011-08-10|df=}}</ref>

===Intravenous injections===
The bioavailability is 100% in intravenous (IV) injection, and the very rapid onset of action is seen within seconds. The T<sub>1/2</sub> is 14.1 to 26.2 hours. The apparent volume of distribution is between 9.5 and 21.7 L/kg.<ref name=PK1999 />  The duration of action is four to six hours. If haloperidol is given as a slow IV infusion, the onset of action is slowed, and the duration of action is prolonged.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

[[File:Haloperidol (Haldol).jpg|thumb|Haloperidol for injection]]

===Therapeutic concentrations===
Plasma levels of four to 25 micrograms per liter are required for therapeutic action. The determination of plasma levels can be used to calculate dose adjustments and to check compliance, particularly in long-term patients. Plasma levels in excess of the therapeutic range may lead to a higher incidence of side effects or even pose the risk of haloperidol intoxication.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The concentration of haloperidol in brain tissue is about 20-fold higher compared to blood levels. It is slowly eliminated from brain tissue,<ref name="Kornhuber1999">{{cite journal |first1=Johannes |last1=Kornhuber |first2=Andreas |last2=Schultz |first3=Jens |last3=Wiltfang |first4=Ingolf |last4=Meineke |first5=Christoph H. |last5=Gleiter |first6=Robert |last6=Zöchling |first7=Karl-Werner |last7=Boissl |first8=Friedrich |last8=Leblhuber |first9=Peter |last9=Riederer |year=1999 |title=Persistence of Haloperidol in Human Brain Tissue |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=156 |issue=6 |pages=885–90 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?volume=156&page=885 |pmid=10360127 |doi=10.1176/ajp.156.6.885}}</ref>  which may explain the slow disappearance of side effects when the medication is stopped.<ref name="Kornhuber1999" /><ref>{{cite journal |first1=Johannes |last1=Kornhuber |first2=Jens |last2=Wiltfang |first3=Peter |last3=Riederer |first4=Stefan |last4=Bleich |year=2006 |title=Neuroleptic drugs in the human brain: Clinical impact of persistence and region-specific distribution |journal=European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience |volume=256 |issue=5 |pages=274–80 |pmid=16788768 |doi=10.1007/s00406-006-0661-7}}</ref>

===Distribution and metabolism===
Haloperidol is heavily protein bound in human plasma, with a free fraction of only 7.5 to 11.6%. It is also extensively metabolized in the liver with only about 1% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine. The greatest proportion of the hepatic clearance is by glucuronidation, followed by reduction and CYP-mediated oxidation, primarily by [[CYP3A4]].<ref name=PK1999 />
