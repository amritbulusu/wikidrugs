==Side effects==

Some of the [[adverse drug reaction|adverse reaction]]s of taking mercaptopurine may include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, fatigue, stomach/abdominal pain, weakness, skin [[rash]], darkening of the skin, and hair loss. Serious adverse reactions include mouth sores, [[fever]], [[sore throat]], easy bruising or bleeding, pinpoint red spots on the skin, yellowing of eyes or skin, dark [[urine]], and painful or difficult urination. Other more serious side effects include black or tarry [[human feces|stools]] ([[melena]]), bloody stools, and bloody [[urine]].

Symptoms of allergic reaction to mercaptopurine include [[rash]], [[itching]], [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]], [[dizziness]], trouble [[breathing]], and [[pancreatitis|inflammation of the pancreas]].

In some cases, mercaptopurine may [[myelosuppression|suppress the production of blood cells]], both [[white blood cell]]s and [[red blood cell]]s. It may be toxic to [[bone marrow]]. Quarterly blood counts are necessary for people on mercaptopurine.  People should stop taking the medication at least temporarily while considering alternate treatment if there is an unexplained, abnormally large drop in white blood cell count, or any other blood count.

===Precautions===

Mercaptopurine can lower the body's ability to fight off infection. Those taking it should get permission from a doctor to receive [[immunization]]s and [[vaccination]]s. It is also recommended that, while on the drug, one should avoid those having recently received oral [[polio]] vaccine.

== Drug interactions ==
Allopurinol inhibits [[xanthine oxidase]], the enzyme that breaks down mercaptopurine.  Those taking [[allopurinol]] (often used to prevent gout) are at risk for mercaptopurine toxicity.  The dose should be reduced or allopurinol should be discontinued.
Several published studies have demonstrated that the use of allopurinol in combination with low dose 6-MP helps reduce 6-MP levels, which are toxic to liver tissue, whilst increasing the therapeutic levels of 6-MP for some inflammatory conditions.

*Mercaptopurine (6-MP) competes with the [[purine]] derivatives [[hypoxanthine]] and [[guanine]] for the enzyme [[hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase|HGPRT]] and is itself converted to thio inosine monophosphate (TIMP). 
**TIMP inhibits several chemical reactions involving [[inosinic acid]] (IMP), including the conversion of IMP to [[xanthylic acid]] (XMP) and the conversion of IMP to [[adenylic acid]] (AMP) via adenylosuccinate (SAMP). 
**In addition, 6-methylthioinosinate (MTIMP) is formed by the methylation of TIMP. 
***Both TIMP and MTIMP have been reported to inhibit glutamine-5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase, the first enzyme unique to the ''de novo'' pathway for purine ribonucleotide synthesis. Experiments indicate that radiolabeled mercaptopurine may be recovered from the DNA in the form of deoxythioguanosine. 
*Some mercaptopurine is converted to nucleotide derivatives of 6-thioguanine (6-TG) by the sequential actions of inosinate (IMP) dehydrogenase and xanthylate (XMP) aminase, converting TIMP to thioguanylic acid (TGMP).
*Animal tumors that are resistant to mercaptopurine often have lost the ability to convert mercaptopurine to TIMP. However, it is clear that resistance to mercaptopurine may be acquired by other means as well, particularly in human leukemias.
*It is not known exactly which of any one or more of the biochemical effects of mercaptopurine and its metabolites are directly or predominantly responsible for cell death.

6-MP ribonucleotide inhibits purine nucleotide synthesis and metabolism by inhibiting an enzyme called [[Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase]] (PRPP Amidotransferase). PRPP Amidotransferase is the rate limiting enzyme of purine synthesis.<ref>Hansen, Barbara. "Purine and Pyrimidine Metabolism." USMLE STEP 1 Biochemistry and Medical Genetics Lecture Notes. 2010 ed.

===Pharmacogenetics===

The enzyme [[thiopurine S-methyltransferase|thiopurine ''S''-methyltransferase]] (TPMT) is responsible, in part, for the inactivation of 6-mercaptopurine. TPMT catalyzes the [[methylation]] of 6-mercaptopurine into the inactive metabolite 6-methylmercaptopurine – this [[methylation]] prevents mercaptopurine from further conversion into active, [[cytotoxic]] thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) metabolites.<ref name="pmid19952870">{{cite journal |vauthors=Zaza G, Cheok M, Krynetskaia N, Thorn C, Stocco G, Hebert JM, McLeod H, Weinshilboum RM, Relling MV, Evans WE, Klein TE, Altman RB | title=Thiopurine pathway | journal=Pharmcogenet Genomics | volume=20 | issue=9 | pages=573–4 |date=September 2010 | pmid=19952870 | pmc=3098750 | doi=10.1097/FPC.0b013e328334338f}}</ref><ref name="pmid24707136">{{cite journal |vauthors=Stocco G, Pelin M, Franca R, De Iudicibus S, Cuzzoni E, Favretto D, Martelossi S, Ventura A, Decorti G | title=Pharmacogenetics of azathioprine in inflammatory bowel disease: a role for glutathione-S-transferase?| journal=World J Gastroenterol | volume=20 | issue=13 | pages=3534–41 |date=April 2014 | pmid=24707136 | pmc=3974520| doi=10.3748/wjg.v20.i13.3534}}</ref><ref name="pmid17691917">{{cite journal|vauthors=Fujita K, Sasaki Y |title=Pharmacogenomics in drug-metabolizing enzymes catalyzing anticancer drugs for personalized cancer chemotherapy |journal=Curr.
