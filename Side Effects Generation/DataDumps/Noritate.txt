'''Noritate''' is a topical [[Cream (pharmaceutical)|cream]] usually prescribed for [[rosacea]], a disease of the skin commonly associated with adult [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] and most notably frequent to constant flushing of the face around the cheeks and chin area.

Noritate contains 1% [[anti-inflammatory]] [[drug]] [[metronidazole]] designed to reduce redness in inflamed areas.

While noritate may get rid of some pustules and reduce redness, it has been shown to result in acne in an exceptionally small number of users. The drug information [[pamphlet]] claims only 1% of users see ill effects. In many cases, users see no reduction in general redness associated with rosacea and sometimes even a worsening effect. Similar results are reported for [[Metrogel]], which contains the same 1% [[metronidazole]].
