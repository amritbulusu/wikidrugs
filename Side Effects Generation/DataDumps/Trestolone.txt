'''Trestolone''' ({{abbrlink|INN|International Nonproprietary Name}}), also known as '''7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone''' ('''MENT'''), is a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]] [[anabolic-androgenic steroid]] (AAS) of the [[nandrolone]] (19-nortestosterone) group which was never marketed. It can be used to build [[muscle]] rapidly{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} and is a theoretical candidate drug for use in hormonal [[male contraceptive]] methods.<ref name="Elks2014">{{cite book|author=J.

Trestolone is an experimental contraceptive treatment and is not yet available commercially. It is currently being evaluated for safety and effectiveness in scientific studies, supported by the [[Population Council]].<ref>[http://www.popcouncil.org/research/ment-subdermal-implants-for-men MENT] – project information from the Population Council</ref>

==Pharmacology==
As a derivative of the [[anabolic steroid]] hormone [[nandrolone]] (19-nortestosterone), trestolone's viability as a male contraceptive via spermatogenesis suppression is ten-fold in comparison to [[testosterone]].<ref>{{cite journal| pmid=8489761 | volume=25 | title=7 alpha-methyl-nortestosterone (MENT): the optimal androgen for male contraception | year=1993 | journal=Ann Med | pages=199–205 | author=Sundaram K, Kumar N, Bardin CW | doi=10.3109/07853899309164168}}</ref>

===Inhibition of sperm production===
[[Spermatozoa]] are produced in the [[testes]] of males in a process called [[spermatogenesis]]. In order to render a man infertile, a hormone-based male contraceptive method must stop spermatogenesis by interrupting the release of [[gonadotropins]] from the [[pituitary gland]].  Even in low concentrations, trestolone is a potent inhibitor of the release of the gonadotropin hormones, [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) and [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In order for spermatogenesis to occur in the testes, both FSH and the male hormone [[testosterone]] must be present. By inhibiting release of FSH, trestolone creates an [[endocrine]] environment in which conditions for spermatogenesis are not ideal. Manufacture of sperm is further impaired by the suppression of LH, which in turn drastically curtails the production of testosterone. Sufficient regular doses of trestolone cause severe [[oligozoospermia]] or [[azoospermia]], and therefore infertility, in most male patients.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Trestolone-induced sterility has been found to be quickly reversible upon discontinuation. Anecdotal evidence shows a 45- to 90-day reversal in most people with stimulation of LH and FSH. This includes clomiphene and human chorionic gonadotropin {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Support of secondary sex characteristics===
When LH release is inhibited, the amount of testosterone made in the testes declines dramatically. As a result of trestolone's gonadotropin-suppressing qualities, levels of serum testosterone fall sharply in patients. Testosterone is the primary hormone responsible for maintenance of male [[secondary sex characteristics]].

Normally, inadequate testosterone levels cause undesirable effects, such as [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], loss of [[skeletal muscle]] mass, reduced [[libido]], and weight gain. However, the androgenic and anabolic properties of trestolone largely ameliorate this problem. Essentially, trestolone replaces testosterone's role as the primary male hormone in the body.

Trestolone, also known as '''7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone''' ('''MENT''') or as '''7α-methylestr-4-en-17β-ol-3-one''', is a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]] [[estrane]] [[steroid]] and a [[chemical derivative|derivative]] of [[nandrolone]] (19-nortestosterone). It is a modification of nandrolone with a [[methyl group]] at the C7α position. Closely related AAS include [[7α-methyl-19-norandrostenedione]] (MENT dione, trestione) (an [[androgen prohormone]] of trestolone) and [[dimethandrolone]] (7α,11β-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone) (the C11β methylated derivative of trestolone), as well as [[mibolerone]] (7α,17α-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone) and [[dimethyltrienolone]] (7α,17α-dimethyl-δ<sup>9,11</sup>-19-nortestosterone).
