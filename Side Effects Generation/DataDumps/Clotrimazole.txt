==Medical uses==
It is commonly available [[over-the-counter drug|without a prescription]] in various [[dosage form]]s, such as a cream, vaginal tablet, or as a prescription [[Throat lozenge|troche]] or throat lozenge (prescription only).  Topically, clotrimazole is used for [[Vulvovaginal candidiasis|vulvovaginal candidiasis (yeast infection)]] or yeast infections of the skin.  For vulvovaginal candidiasis (yeast infection), clotrimazole tablets and creams are inserted into the vagina.  Troche or throat lozenge preparations are used for [[Oral thrush|oropharyngeal candidiasis (oral thrush)]] or [[prophylaxis]] against oral thrush in [[neutropenic]] patients.

Clotrimazole is usually used 5 times daily for 14 days for oral thrush, twice daily for 2 to 8 weeks for skin infections, and once daily for 3 or 7 days for vaginal infections.<ref>{{cite web|title=Clotrimazole: MedlinePlus Drug Information|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682753.html|publisher=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Inc|accessdate=17 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418035653/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682753.html|archivedate=18 April 2014|df=}}</ref>

Clotrimazole may be compounded with a [[glucocorticoid]], such as [[betamethasone]], in a topical cream for the treatment of [[Tinea corporis|tinea corporis (ringworm)]], [[Tinea cruris|tinea cruris (jock itch)]] and [[tinea pedis (athlete's foot)]]. Although FDA approved, clotrimazole-betamethasone combination cream is not the preferred treatment for dermatophyte infections due to increased side effects from the topical glucocorticoid. Although temporary relief and partial suppression of symptoms may be observed with the combination therapy, glucocorticoids can elicite an immunosuppressive response and rebound effect that results in more severe infection typically requiring systemic antifungal agents to treat the disease. Combination creams are best avoided in order to improve treatment outcome, reduce the possibility of skin atrophy associated with prolonged topical glucocorticoid use, and to limit the cost of treatment. It can be effective in treating chronic paronychia. The preferred treatment of tinea infections is therefore with clotrimazole monotherapy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moriarty|first1=B|last2=Hay|first2=R|last3=Morris-Jones|first3=R|title=The diagnosis and management of tinea.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=10 July 2012|volume=345|pages=e4380|pmid=22782730|doi=10.1136/bmj.e4380}}</ref>

Topical and oral clotrimazole can be used in both adults and children.

Additionally, clotrimazole may be used to treat the sickling of cells (related to [[sickle cell anemia]]).<ref>Marieb & Hoehn, (2010). ''Human Anatomy and Physiology'', p. 643. Toronto: Pearson</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Rodgers|first=Griffin|title=Hydroxyurea and other disease-modifying therapies in sickle cell disease|url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydroxyurea-and-other-disease-modifying-therapies-in-sickle-cell-disease?source=search_result&search=hydroxyurea&selectedTitle=1~87|publisher=UpToDate|accessdate=14 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415042143/http://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydroxyurea-and-other-disease-modifying-therapies-in-sickle-cell-disease?source=search_result&search=hydroxyurea&selectedTitle=1~87|archivedate=15 April 2014|df=}}</ref>

===Pregnancy===
Small amounts of clotrimazole may be absorbed systemically following topical and vaginal administration.  However, this may still be used to treat [[yeast infection]]s in pregnant women.<ref>{{cite web|title=Diseases Characterized by Vaginal Discharge|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/vaginal-discharge.htm|publisher=CDC|accessdate=17 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428171000/http://www.cdc.gov/sTD/treatment/2010/vaginal-discharge.htm|archivedate=28 April 2014|df=}}</ref>

==Side effects==
[[Side effect]]s of the oral formulation include itching, nausea, and vomiting. >10% of patients using the oral formulation may have [[Liver function tests|abnormal liver function tests]]. Side effects include rash, hives, blisters, burning, itching, peeling, redness, swelling, pain or other signs of skin irritation.<ref name=AHFS2016/> For this reason, [[liver function tests]] should be monitored periodically when taking the oral clotrimazole (troche). When used to treat [[Yeast infection|vulvovaginal candidiasis (yeast infection)]], <10% of patient have vulvar or vaginal burning sensation. <1% of patients have the following side effects: Burning or itching of penis of sexual partner; [[polyuria]]; vulvar itching, soreness, edema, or discharge  <ref>{{cite web|title=Clotrimazole: MedlinePlus Drug Information|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682753.html|publisher=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Inc|accessdate=17 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418035653/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682753.html|archivedate=18 April 2014|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Clotrimazole|url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00257|publisher=DrugBank|accessdate=17 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417070045/http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00257|archivedate=17 April 2014|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://online.lexi.com/lco/action/doc/retrieve/docid/patch_f/1772079|title=Clotrimazole (Oral)|publisher=Lexicomp Online|accessdate=17 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123091514/http://online.lexi.com/lco/action/doc/retrieve/docid/patch_f/1772079|archivedate=23 January 2015|df=}}</ref>

Clotrimazole creams and suppositories contain oil which may weaken latex [[condoms]] and [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragms]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Diseases Characterized by Vaginal Discharge|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/vaginal-discharge.htm|publisher=CDC|accessdate=17 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428171000/http://www.cdc.gov/sTD/treatment/2010/vaginal-discharge.htm|archivedate=28 April 2014|df=}}</ref>

==Drug interactions==
There are no known significant drug interactions with topical clotrimazole. However, with oral (troche) clotrimazole, there are multiple interactions as the medication is a [[CYP450|CYP450 enzyme]] [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]], primarily [[CYP3A4]]. Thus, any medication that is metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme will potentially have elevated levels when oral clotrimazole is used.  The prescribing physician should be aware of any medication the patient is taking prior to starting oral clotrimazole.  Certain medications should not be taken with oral clotrimazole.<ref>{{cite web|title=Clotrimazole|url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00257|publisher=DrugBank|accessdate=17 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417070045/http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00257|archivedate=17 April 2014|df=}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Clotrimazole works to kill individual ''[[Candida albicans|Candida]]'' or fungal cells by altering the [[Semipermeable membrane|permeability]] of the fungal [[cell wall]].  It binds to [[phospholipid]]s in the [[cell membrane]] and inhibits the [[biosynthesis]] of [[ergosterol]] and other [[sterols]] required for [[cell membrane]] production. This leads to the [[cell death|cell's death]] via loss of intracellular elements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://online.lexi.com/lco/action/doc/retrieve/docid/patch_f/1772079|title=Clotrimazole (Oral)|publisher=Lexicomp Online|accessdate=17 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123091514/http://online.lexi.com/lco/action/doc/retrieve/docid/patch_f/1772079|archivedate=23 January 2015|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Clotrimazole|url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00257|publisher=DrugBank|accessdate=17 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417070045/http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00257|archivedate=17 April 2014|df=}}</ref>
