'''Chlordiazepoxide''', trade name '''Librium''', is a [[sedative]] and [[hypnotic]] medication of the [[benzodiazepine]] class; it is used to treat [[anxiety]], [[insomnia]] and [[withdrawal]] symptoms from alcohol and/or drug abuse.

Chlordiazepoxide has a medium to long [[half-life]] but its active metabolite has a very long half-life. The drug has [[amnestic]], [[anticonvulsant]], [[anxiolytic]], [[hypnotic]], [[sedative]] and [[skeletal muscle relaxant]] properties.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Liljequist R |author2=Palva E|author3=Linnoila M |journal=Int Pharmacopsychiatry |year=1979 |title=Effects on learning and memory of 2-week treatments with chlordiazepoxide lactam, N-desmethyldiazepam, oxazepam and methyloxazepam, alone or in combination with alcohol |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=190–8 |pmid=42628}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
Chlordiazepoxide is indicated for the short-term (2&ndash;4 weeks) treatment of anxiety that is severe and disabling or subjecting the person to unacceptable distress. It is also indicated as a treatment for the management of acute  [[alcohol withdrawal syndrome]].<ref name=UKlabelGeneric>{{cite web|title=Chlordiazepoxide 10mg Capsules - Summary of Product Characteristics|url=https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/26299|publisher=UK Electronic Medicines Compendium|accessdate=23 April 2017|language=en|date=19 December 2012}}</ref> 

It is also used to treat [[irritable bowel syndrome]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Chlordiazepoxide|url=https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682078.html|publisher=MedlinePlus Drug Information|language=en|date=February 15, 2017}}</ref>

==Contraindications==
Use of chlordiazepoxide should be avoided in individuals with the following conditions:
* [[Myasthenia gravis]]
* Acute intoxication with alcohol, narcotics, or other psychoactive substances
* [[Ataxia]]
* Severe [[hypoventilation]]
* Acute narrow-angle [[glaucoma]]
* Severe liver deficiencies ([[hepatitis]] and liver [[cirrhosis]] decrease elimination by a factor of 2)
* Severe [[sleep apnea]]
* Hypersensitivity or allergy to any drug in the [[benzodiazepine]] class

Chlordiazepoxide is generally considered an inappropriate benzodiazepine for the elderly due to its long [[elimination half-life]] and the risks of accumulation.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1 = GG. | last2 = Christensen | first2 = DB. | title = The continuing challenge of inappropriate prescribing in the elderly: an update of the evidence. | journal = J Am Pharm Assoc (Wash) | volume = 42 | issue = 6 | pages = 847–57 | year =  2002| doi =  10.1331/108658002762063682| pmid = 12482007 }}</ref> Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, pregnancy, children, alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with [[comorbid]] [[psychiatric disorders]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Authier | first1 = N. | last2 = Balayssac | first2 = D. | last3 = Sautereau | first3 = M. | last4 = Zangarelli | first4 = A. | last5 = Courty | first5 = P. | last6 = Somogyi | first6 = AA. | last7 = Vennat | first7 = B. | last8 = Llorca | first8 = PM. | last9 = Eschalier | first9 = A. | title = Benzodiazepine dependence: focus on withdrawal syndrome | journal = Ann Pharm Fr | volume = 67 | issue = 6 | pages = 408–13 |date=November 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharma.2009.07.001 | pmid = 19900604  }}</ref>

===Pregnancy===
The research into the safety of benzodiazepines during pregnancy is limited and it is recommended that use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy should be based on whether the benefits outweigh the risks. If chlordiazepoxide is used during pregnancy the risks can be reduced via using the lowest effective dose and for the shortest time possible. Benzodiazepines should generally be avoided during the [[first trimester]] of pregnancy. Chlordiazepoxide and diazepam are considered to be among the safer benzodiazepines to use during pregnancy in comparison to other benzodiazepines. Possible adverse effects from benzodiazepine use during pregnancy include, [[abortion]], [[malformation]], [[intrauterine growth retardation]], functional deficits, [[carcinogenesis]] and [[mutagenesis]]. Caution is also advised during [[breast feeding]] as chlordiazepoxide passes into breast milk.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Iqbal | first1 = MM. | last2 = Aneja | first2 = A. | last3 = Fremont | first3 = WP. | title = Effects of chlordiazepoxide (Librium) during pregnancy and lactation. | journal = Conn Med | volume = 67 | issue = 5 | pages = 259–62 |date=May 2003 | pmid = 12802839 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1176/appi.ps.53.1.39 | last1 = Iqbal | first1 = MM. | last2 = Sobhan | first2 = T. | last3 = Ryals | first3 = T. | title = Effects of commonly used benzodiazepines on the fetus, the neonate, and the nursing infant. | journal = Psychiatr Serv | volume = 53 | issue = 1 | pages = 39–49 |date=Jan 2002 | pmid = 11773648 }}</ref>

===Tolerance and dependence===

====Tolerance====

Chronic use of benzodiazepines, such as chlordiazepoxide, leads to the development of tolerance, with a decrease in number of benzodiazepine binding sites in mouse forebrain.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Crawley JN |authorlink=Jacqueline Crawley |author2=Marangos PJ|author3=Stivers J|author4=Goodwin FK |date=January 1982 |title=Chronic clonazepam administration induces benzodiazepine receptor subsensitivity |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=85&ndash;9 |pmid=6278355 |journal=Neuropharmacology |doi=10.1016/0028-3908(82)90216-7}}</ref> The Committee of Review of Medicines, who carried out an extensive review of benzodiazepines including chlordiazepoxide, found - and were in agreement with the [[Institute of Medicine]] (USA) and the conclusions of a study carried out by the White House Office of Drug Policy and the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] (USA) - that there was little evidence that long-term use of benzodiazepines were beneficial in the treatment of insomnia due to the development of tolerance. Benzodiazepines tended to lose their sleep-promoting properties within 3&ndash;14 days of continuous use, and in the treatment of anxiety the committee found that there was little convincing evidence that benzodiazepines retained efficacy in the treatment of anxiety after 4 months' continuous use due to the development of tolerance.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Committee on the Review of Medicines | date  =  March 29, 1980 |  title = Systematic review of the benzodiazepines.

====Dependence====

Chlordiazepoxide can cause [[physical dependence]] and what is known as the [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]]. Withdrawal from chlordiazepoxide or other benzodiazepines often leads to withdrawal symptoms that are similar to those seen with alcohol and [[barbiturates]]. The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can, however, occur at standard dosages and also after short-term use. Benzodiazepine treatment should be discontinued as soon as possible through a slow and gradual dose-reduction regime.<ref>{{cite journal | author = MacKinnon GL |author2=Parker WA. | year = 1982 | title = Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome: a literature review and evaluation | journal = The American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 19&ndash;33 | pmid = 6133446| doi = 10.3109/00952998209002608 }}</ref>

Chlordiazepoxide taken during pregnancy can cause a [[postnatal]] [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Pediatr Med Chir | author = Moretti M |author2=Montali S |date=September 1982 | title = [Fetal defects caused by the passive consumption of drugs] | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 481&ndash;90 | pmid = 6985425 }}</ref>

===Overdose===
{{See also|Benzodiazepine overdose}}
An individual who has consumed excess chlordiazepoxide may display some of the following symptoms:
* [[Somnolence]] (difficulty staying awake)
* Mental confusion
* [[Hypotension]]
* [[Hypoventilation]]
* Impaired motor functions
** Impaired reflexes
** Impaired coordination
** Impaired balance
** [[Dizziness]]
** [[Muscle weakness]]
* [[Coma]]

In animal models, the oral [[median lethal dose]] of chlordiazepoxide is 537&nbsp;mg/kg.

Chlordiazepoxide is a drug that is very frequently involved in drug intoxication, including overdose.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Zevzikovas A |author2=Kiliuviene G|author3=Ivanauskas L|author4=Dirse V. | year = 2002 | title = [Analysis of benzodiazepine derivative mixture by gas-liquid chromatography] | journal = Medicina (Kaunas). | volume = 38 | issue = 3 | pages = 316&ndash;20 | pmid = 12474705 }}</ref> Chlordiazepoxide overdose is considered a medical emergency and, in general, requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. The [[antidote]] for an [[Drug overdose|overdose]] of chlordiazepoxide (or any other benzodiazepine) is [[flumazenil]]. Flumazenil should be given with caution as it may precipitate severe withdrawal symptoms in benzodiazepine-dependent individuals.

==Pharmacology==
Chlordiazepoxide acts on [[benzodiazepine]] allosteric sites that are part of the  GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor/ion-channel complex and this results in an increased binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter [[GABA]] to the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor thereby producing inhibitory effects on the [[central nervous system]] and body similar to the effects of other [[benzodiazepines]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Skerritt JH |author2=Johnston GA. | date =  May 6, 1983 |  title = Enhancement of GABA binding by benzodiazepines and related anxiolytics | journal = Eur J Pharmacol. | volume = 89 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 193&ndash;8 | pmid = 6135616 | doi = 10.1016/0014-2999(83)90494-6 }}</ref> Chlordiazepoxide is [[anticonvulsant]].<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Life Sci | date =  February 25, 1985 |  volume = 36| issue = 8| pages = 737&ndash;44| title = Effect of GABA agonists on the neurotoxicity and anticonvulsant activity of benzodiazepines| author = Chweh AY|author2=Swinyard EA|author3=Wolf HH|author4=Kupferberg HJ| pmid = 2983169| doi = 10.1016/0024-3205(85)90193-6}}</ref>
There is preferential storage of chlordiazepoxide in some organs including the heart of the neonate. Absorption by any administered route and the risk of accumulation is significantly increased in the neonate. The withdrawal of chlordiazepoxide during pregnancy and breast feeding is recommended, as chlordiazepoxide rapidly crosses the placenta and also is excreted in breast milk.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Olive G |author2=Dreux C. |date=January 1977 | title = Pharmacologic bases of use of benzodiazepines in peréinatal medicine | journal = Arch Fr Pediatr | volume = 34 | pages = 74&ndash;89 | pmid = 851373 | issue = 1 }}</ref>  Chlordiazepoxide also decreases prolactin release in rats.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Grandison L |year=1982 |title=Suppression of prolactin secretion by benzodiazepines in vivo |journal=Neuroendocrinology |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=369&ndash;73 |pmid=6979001 |doi=10.1159/000123330}}</ref> Benzodiazepines act via [[micromolar]] benzodiazepine binding sites as [[Ca2+]] channel blockers and significantly inhibit depolarization-sensitive Calcium uptake in animal nerve terminal preparations.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |date=May 1984 | volume = 81 | issue = 10 | pages = 3118&ndash;22 | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/81/10/3118.pdf |format=PDF| type = PDF | title = Micromolar-affinity benzodiazepine receptors regulate voltage-sensitive calcium channels in nerve terminal preparations | author = Taft WC |author2=DeLorenzo RJ | pmid = 6328498 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.81.10.3118 | pmc = 345232}}</ref> Chlordiazepoxide inhibits [[acetylcholine]] release in mouse hippocampal synaptosomes in vivo.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Chlordiazepoxide is a long-acting benzodiazepine drug. The half-life of Chlordiazepoxide is 5 – 30 hours but has an active benzodiazepine metabolite (desmethyldiazepam), which has a half-life of 36 – 200 hours.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bcnc.org.uk/equivalence.html | title = Benzodiazepine equivalency table | accessdate = September 23, 2007 | author = Ashton CH. |date=April 2007 }}</ref> The half-life of chlordiazepoxide increases significantly in the elderly, which may result in prolonged action as well as accumulation of the drug during repeated administration. Delayed body clearance of the long half-life active metabolite also occurs in those over 60 years of age, which further prolongs the effects of the drugs with additional accumulation after repeated dosing.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Vozeh S. | date =  November 21, 1981 |  title = [Pharmacokinetic of benzodiazepines in old age] | journal = Schweiz Med Wochenschr. | volume = 111 | issue = 47 | pages = 1789&ndash;93 | pmid = 6118950 }}</ref>

==History==
Chlordiazepoxide (initially called ''methaminodiazepoxide'') was the first benzodiazepine to be synthesised in the mid-1950s. Chlordiazepoxide was synthesised from work on a chemical dye, quinazolone-3-oxides. It was discovered by accident when in 1957 tests revealed that the compound had [[hypnotic]], [[anxiolytic]] and [[muscle relaxant]] effects. Three years later chlordiazepoxide was marketed as a therapeutic benzodiazepine medication under the brand name Librium. Following chlordiazepoxide, in 1963 [[diazepam]] hit the market under the brand name Valium - and was followed by many further benzodiazepine compounds over the subsequent years and decades.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.etfrc.com/benzos1.htm|title=The Complete Story of the Benzodiazepines|last=Cooper|first=Jack R|date=January 15, 1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-510399-8|edition=seventh|location=USA|pages=|author2=Floyd E. Bloom|author3=Robert H. Roth|accessdate=7 Apr 2008|chapterurl=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315230230/http://www.etfrc.com/benzos1.htm|archivedate=2008-03-18}}</ref>

In 1959 it was used by over 2,000 physicians and more than 20,000 patients. It was described as "chemically and clinically different from any of the tranquilizers, psychic energizers or other psychotherapeutic drugs now available." During studies, chlordiazepoxide induced muscle relaxation and a quieting effect on laboratory animals like mice, [[rat]]s, [[cat]]s, and [[dog]]s. Fear and aggression were eliminated in much smaller doses than those necessary to produce hypnosis. Chlordiazepoxide is similar to [[phenobarbital]] in its [[anticonvulsant]] properties. However, it lacks the hypnotic effects of [[barbiturates]]. Animal tests were conducted in the [[Franklin Park Zoo|Boston Zoo]] and the [[San Diego Zoo]]. Forty-two hospital patients admitted for acute and chronic alcoholism, and various [[psychoses]] and [[neuroses]] were treated with chlordiazepoxide. In a majority of the patients, [[anxiety]], [[Stress (biology)|tension]], and motor excitement were "effectively reduced." The most positive results were observed among [[alcoholic]] patients. It was reported that [[ulcer]]s and [[Dermatology|dermatologic]] problems, both of which involving emotional factors, were reduced by chlordiazepoxide.<ref>{{cite news | authorlink = New York Times | author=New York Times | title = Help For Mental Ills (Reports on Tests of Synthetic Drug Say The Results are Positive) | publisher = New York Times | location = USA | page = E9 | date = 28 February 1960 }}</ref>

Chlordiazepoxide enabled the treatment of emotional disturbances without a loss of mental acuity or alertness. It assisted persons burdened by [[compulsive behavior]] who, amongst other behaviors, felt compelled to count the slats on [[venetian blinds]] upon entering a room.<ref>{{cite news | authorlink = New York Times | author = New York Times | title = Makers Worried On Tranquilizers | publisher = New York Times | location = USA | page = F1 | date = 28 August 1960 }}</ref> In 1963, approval for use was given to [[diazepam]] (Valium), a "simplified" version of chlordiazepoxide, primarily to counteract anxiety symptoms. Sleep-related problems were treated with [[nitrazepam]] (Mogadon), which was introduced in 1965, [[temazepam]] (Restoril), which was introduced in 1969, and [[flurazepam]] (Dalmane), which was introduced in 1973.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sternbach LH |title=The discovery of librium |journal=Agents Actions |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=193–6 |year=1972 |pmid=4557348 |doi=10.1007/BF01965860}}</ref>

In 1963, Carl F. Essig of the [[Addiction Research Center]] of the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] stated that [[meprobamate]], [[glutethimide]], [[ethinamate]], [[ethchlorvynol]], [[methyprylon]] and chlordiazepoxide as drugs whose usefulness ''can hardly be questioned.'' However, Essig labeled these ''newer products'' as ''drugs of addiction,'' like [[barbiturates]], whose habit-forming qualities were more widely known. He mentioned a 90-day study of chlordiazepoxide, which concluded that the automobile accident rate among 68 users was 10 times higher than normal. Participants' daily dosage ranged from 5 to 100 milligrams.<ref>{{cite news | authorlink = New York Times | author = New York Times | title = Warning Is Issued On Tranquilizers | publisher = New York Times | location = USA | page = 23 | date = 30 December 1963 }}</ref>

Laboratory tests assessing the toxicity of chlordiazepoxide, [[nitrazepam]] and [[diazepam]] on mice [[spermatozoa]] found that chlordiazepoxide produced toxicities in sperm including abnormalities involving both the shape and size of the sperm head. Nitrazepam, however, caused more profound abnormalities than chlordiazepoxide.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kar RN |author2=Das RK. | year = 1983 | title = Induction of sperm head abnormalities in mice by three tranquilizers | journal = Cytobios | volume = 36 | issue = 141 | pages = 45&ndash;51 | pmid = 6132780 }}</ref>
