==Synthesis==
Flavone inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases; the (-)-cis form induces apoptosis in certain tumor cells.

[[Tetrahydropyridine]] ('''1''') is obtainable by reacting ''N''-methyl-4-piperidone with 1,3,5-[[trimethoxybenzene]] (trimethyl-[[Phloroglucinol]]) in HOAc and bubbling through [[HCl]] gas, which must cause dehydration of the initially formed 3° alcohol to ''o'',''o'',''p''-trimethoxy-[[MPTP]]. For the next step, [[hydroboration]] of the product from the last step is done by the addition of [[diborane]] to the olefin, followed by oxidation of the [[hydroborane]] adduct with a [[peroxide]] then affords the hydration product as the ''trans'' isomer ('''2'''). {Although [[borane]] is the usual reagent, it appears here that it is generated ''[[in situ]]'' from [[Boron trifluoride|BF<sub>3</sub>]] and [[NaBH4|NaBH<sub>4</sub>]].} The stereochemistry of that hydroxy group is reversed in 2 steps starting by what appears to be a [[Swern oxidation]] to a ketone; which is then reduced with [[NaBH4|NaBH<sub>4</sub>]] to afford ('''3'''). The ''cis'' relationship is apparently based on the principle that the [[hydride]] ion approaches from the less sterically occluded/precluded side, which in this case is opposite to the Ar. '''3''' is then acylated with [[acetic anhydride]] in the presence of [[Boron trifluoride|BF<sub>3</sub>]]. Using an excess of the latter reagent leads to selective desmethylation of the ether adjacent to the newly introduced acetyl function ('''4'''). [[Claisen condensation]] of that product with methyl-2-chlorobenzoate would then afford the β-diketone ('''5'''). A stream of dry [[HCl]] gas in a [[condensation reaction]] splits out one equivalent of water and formation of the [[pyran]] ring by an [[addition-elimination reaction]] ('''6'''). [[Desmethylation]] of the two remaining methoxy groups (phenolic ethers), for example [[boron tribromide]], would then afford alvocidib ('''7''').
