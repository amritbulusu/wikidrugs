'''Cefotiam''' is a [[parenteral]] second-generation [[cephalosporin]] [[antibiotic]]. It has broad-spectrum activity against [[Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative]] bacteria. As a [[beta-lactam]], its bactericidal activity results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for [[penicillin-binding proteins]].

Cefotiam was launched as Pansporin in February 1981 by [[Takeda Pharmaceutical]] of Japan and has been available as a generic since February 1993.

==Mechanism of action==
Cefotiam inhibits final cross-linking stage of [[peptidoglycan]] production, thus inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis. It has similar or less activity against Gram-positive [[staphylococci]] and [[streptococci]], but is resistant to some [[beta-lactamases]] produced by Gram-negative bacteria. It is more active against many of the [[Enterobacteriaceae]] including ''[[Enterobacter]], [[E. coli]], [[Klebsiella]], [[Salmonella]]'' and [[Indole test|indole-positive]] ''[[Proteus]]'' species.

In clinical use, high concentrations of cefotiam are observed in several tissues (kidney, heart, ear, prostate, and genital tract), as well as in fluids and secretions (bile, ascitic fluid).

==Spectrum of bacterial susceptibility==
Cefotiam has a broad spectrum of activity and has been used to treat infections caused by a number of enteric bacteria and bacteria responsible for causing skin infections. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant bacteria.
* ''Bacteroides fragilis'': - 16 - >128 μg/ml
* ''Clostridium difficile'': >128 μg/ml
* ''Staphylococcus aureus'': 0.25 - 32 μg/ml

==Indications==
This drug is indicated for prophylaxis for surgical infection, postoperative infections, bacterial [[septicaemia]], bone and joint infections, [[cholangitis]], [[cholecystitis]], [[peritonitis]], [[prostatitis]], [[pyelonephritis]], respiratory tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections, [[cystitis]], [[urethritis]], and infections caused by susceptible organisms. It does not have activity against ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''.

==Dosage==
For adults, the dose is up to 6 grams daily by intravenous or intramuscular route in divided doses according to severity of infection. In patients with [[renal impairment]] a dose reduction may be needed.

==Adverse effects==
Side effects include nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, hypersensitivity reactions, [[nephrotoxicity]], convulsions, CNS toxicity, hepatic dysfunction, haematologic disorders, pain at injection site, thrombophloebitis, [[pseudomembranous colitis]], and [[superinfection]] with prolonged use.
