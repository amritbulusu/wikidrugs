'''Cefadroxil''' (formerly trademarked as Duricef) is a [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]] of the [[cephalosporin]] type, effective in [[Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative]] bacterial infections.  It is a [[bactericidal]] antibiotic.

== General use ==
Cefadroxil is a first-generation cephalosporin antibacterial drug that is the para-hydroxy derivative of [[cefalexin]], and is used similarly in the treatment of mild to moderate susceptible infections such as the bacterium ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'', causing the disease popularly called [[strep throat]] or [[streptococcal tonsillitis]], [[urinary tract infection]], [[reproductive tract infection]], and [[skin infections]].

==Spectrum of bacterial resistance and susceptibility==
Cefadroxil has a broad spectrum of activity and has been effective in treating bacteria responsible for causing tonsillitis, and infections of the skin and urinary tract. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant microorganisms.
* ''Escherichia coli'': 8 μg/ml
* ''Staphylococcus aureus'': 1 – 2 μg/ml
* ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'': ≤1  – >16 μg/ml

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Cefadroxil is almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. After doses of 500&nbsp;mg and 1 g by mouth, peak plasma concentrations of about 16 and 30 micrograms/ml, respectively, are obtained after 1.5 to 2.0 hours. Although peak concentrations are similar to those of cefalexin, plasma concentrations are more sustained. Dosage with food does not appear to affect the absorption of cefadroxil.  About 20% of cefadroxil is reported to be bound to plasma proteins.  Its plasma half-life is about 1.5 hours and is prolonged in patients with renal impairment.

Cefadroxil is widely distributed to body tissues and fluids. It crosses the placenta and appears in breast milk. More than 90% of a dose of cefadroxil may be excreted unchanged in the urine within 24 hours by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion; peak urinary concentrations of 1.8&nbsp;mg/ml have been reported after a dose of 500&nbsp;mg. Cefadroxil is removed by haemodialysis.

== Dosage ==

Cefadroxil is given by mouth, and doses are expressed in terms of the anhydrous substance; 1.04 g of cefadroxil monohydrate is equivalent to about 1 g of anhydrous cefadroxil.<br />
<!-- '''PO''' '''Adults'''. 500&nbsp;mg–1g q12h; '''Peds'''. 15&nbsp;mg/kg q12h; decrease in renal impair. -->
== Side effects ==
The most common side effects of cefadroxil are [[diarrhea]] (which, less commonly, may be bloody), [[nausea]], [[upset stomach]], and [[vomiting]]. Other side effects include<ref name = "Drugs">{{cite web | url = http://www.drugs.com/sfx/cefadroxil-side-effects.html | title = Cefadroxil side effects | publisher = Drugs}}</ref>
[[rashes]], [[hives]], and [[itching]].

== Dental use ==
Cefadroxil is used as an antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures, for patients allergic to penicillins.

== Veterinary use ==
It can be used for treating infected wounds on animals. Usually in powder form mixed with water, it has a color and smell similar to [[Tang (drink)|Tang]]. Given orally to animals, the amount is dependent on their weight and severity of infection.
