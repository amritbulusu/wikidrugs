Like most [[adrenocortical steroids]], methylprednisolone is typically used for its [[anti-inflammatory]] effects. However, glucocorticoids have a wide range of effects, including changes to metabolism and immune responses. The list of medical conditions for which methylprednisolone is prescribed is rather long, and is similar to other [[corticosteroid]]s such as [[prednisolone]]. Common uses include [[arthritis]] therapy and short-term treatment of [[bronchial]] [[inflammation]] or [[acute bronchitis]] due to various respiratory diseases. It is used both in the treatment of acute periods and long-term management of [[autoimmune disease]]s, most notably [[systemic lupus erythematosus]]. It is also used as a treatment for [[multiple sclerosis]].

Another potential use of methylprednisolone is for vestibular neuritis.<ref name="pmid15269315">{{cite journal |vauthors=Strupp M, Zingler VC, Arbusow V, Niklas D, Maag KP, Dieterich M, Bense S, Theil D, Jahn K, Brandt T | title = Methylprednisolone, valacyclovir, or the combination for vestibular neuritis | journal = [[N.

After egg retrieval for a cycle of [[in vitro fertilization|''in vitro'' fertilization]], methylprednisolone may be prescribed to prevent the body from rejecting the embryos being transferred, up to the time of implantation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Medications Commonly Used During the IVF Cycle|url=http://www.infertilityspecialistnewyork.com/ivf-what-to-expect-in-vitro-fertilization-manhattan-brooklyn-bronx-new-york-ny.htm|work=Continuum Reproductive Center|accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=In Vitro Fertilization (IVF)|url=http://www.rmami.com/treatments-female-ivf-troy-michigan.html|work=Reproductive Medicine Associates of Michigan|accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref>

==Side effects==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
Long-term use of methylprednisolone, as with all corticosteroids, can be associated with [[hyperglycemia]], decreased resistance to infection, swelling of face, weight gain, congestive cardiac insufficiency, fluid and sodium retention, [[edema]], [[hypertension]], increased eye pressure, [[glaucoma]], [[osteoporosis]], and [[psychosis]], especially when used at high doses.<ref>{{cite web|title=SOLU-MEDROL (methylprednisolone sodium succinate) injection, powder, for solution|url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=c74ad5ba-18cc-4ca5-9845-a4375b5e51c1|publisher=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=24 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Medrol (Methylprednisolone - Tablets by Pfizer)|url=http://www.sfatulmedicului.ro/medicamente/medrol-comprimate_10997|publisher=Sfatul Medicului|accessdate=14 April 2013}}</ref> The most serious side effect occurs after the adrenal glands cease natural production of [[cortisol]], which methylprednisolone will replace. Abrupt cessation of the drug after this occurs can result in a condition known as [[Addison's disease#Addisonian crisis|Addisonian crisis]], which can be fatal. To prevent this, the drug is usually prescribed with a tapering dose, including a predosed "dose pack" detailing a specific number of tablets to take at designated times over a several-day period. Pharmacists sometimes advise that this drug may cause sleeplessness and "down" moods.

Individuals on methylprednisolone therapy should assiduously avoid exposure to measles and chicken pox, as contracting these viral infections while on high-dose corticosteroids can result in a potentially fatal viral course. Any accidental exposure to these viral infections by individuals uncertain of their immunity to chicken pox or measles should be reported immediately, as prophylactic immunoglobulin therapy may be administered. Additionally, the administration of live, attenuated vaccines is contraindicated for individuals taking immunosuppressive doses of methylprednisolone. The exception to this rule is patients receiving complete corticosteroid replacement therapy, e.g., for [[Addison's disease]], who may follow standard immunization protocols.

==Mechanism of action==
Unbound glucocorticoids cross cell membranes and bind with high affinity to specific cytoplasmic receptors, modifying transcription and protein synthesis. By this mechanism, glucocorticoids can inhibit leukocyte infiltration at the site of inflammation, interfere with mediators of inflammatory response, and suppress humoral immune responses. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, lipocortins, which control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes.
