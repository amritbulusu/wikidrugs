'''Sulfinalol''' is a [[beta adrenergic receptor antagonist]].<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=6182405 | volume=4 | issue=5 | title=Studies on the mechanism of the acute antihypertensive and vasodilator actions of several beta-adrenoceptor antagonists | year=1982 | journal=J.

==Synthesis==
The methyl group on a sulfoxide is sufficiently acidic to substitute for phenolic hydroxyl. 
[[File:Sulfinalol synthesis.svg|thumb|center|700px|Sulfinalol synthesis: R. E. Philion, {{Cite patent|DE|2728641}} (1978 to [[Sterling Drug|Sterling]]), C.A. 90, 137468 (1979).]]
The preparation of this combined α- and β-blocker sulfinalol begins by protection of the phenolic hydroxyl as its benzoate ester. Bromination followed by condensation with 4-(4-methoxyphenyl)butan-2-amine (not [[Para-Methoxyamphetamine|PMA]]) gives the aminoketone '''3'''. Successive catalytic reduction and saponification affords aminoalcohol '''4'''. Oxidation of the [[sulfide]] to the [[sulfoxide]] with a reaagent such as [[metaperiodate]] gives sulfinalol ('''5''').
