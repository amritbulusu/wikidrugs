'''Trimetazidine''' is a drug for [[angina pectoris]] sold under many brand names.<ref name=brands/>  Trimetazidine is described as the first [[cytoprotection|cytoprotective]] anti-ischemic agent developed and marketed by [[Laboratoires Servier]] (France).  Trimetazidine is an anti-ischemic (anti-anginal) metabolic agent, which improves [[myocardium|myocardial]] glucose utilization through inhibition of [[fatty acid metabolism]], also known as [[fatty acid oxidation inhibitor]].

== Medical uses ==

Trimetazidine is usually prescribed as a long-term treatment of angina pectoris, and in some countries (including France) for [[tinnitus]] and dizziness. It is taken twice a day. In 2012 European Medicines Agency (EMA) finished a review of benefits and risks of trimetazidine and recommended restricting use of trimetazidine-containing medicines just as an additional treatment of angina pectoris in case of inadequate control by or intolerance to first-line antianginal therapies.<ref name = "EMA_press_release"/>

Controlled studies in angina patients have shown that trimetazidine increases [[coronary flow reserve]], thereby delaying the onset of ischemia associated with exercise, limits rapid swings in [[blood pressure]] without any significant variations in [[heart rate]], significantly decreases the frequency of angina attacks, and leads to a significant decrease in the use of [[Glyceryl trinitrate (pharmacology)|nitrates]].

It improves [[left ventricle|left ventricular function]] in diabetic patients with [[coronary heart disease]]. Recently, it has been shown to be effective in patients with [[heart failure]] of different etiologies.<ref name="pmid16949492">{{cite journal |vauthors=Fragasso G, Palloshi A, Puccetti P, Silipigni C, Rossodivita A, Pala M, Calori G, Alfieri O, Margonato A | title = A randomized clinical trial of trimetazidine, a partial free fatty acid oxidation inhibitor, in patients with heart failure | journal = J.

== Adverse effects ==

Trimetazidine has been treated as a drug with a high safety and tolerability profile.<ref name=Cochrane2005/>  It interacts with [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s.

There is scarce information about trimetazidine's effect on mortality, cardiovascular events or quality of life. Long term randomized controlled trials comparing trimetazidine against standard anti-anginal agents, using clinically important outcomes would be justifiable.<ref name=Cochrane2005>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ciapponi A, Pizarro R, Harrison J | title = Trimetazidine for stable angina | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = | issue = 4 | pages = CD003614 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16235330 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003614.pub2 | url = http://summaries.cochrane.org/CD003614/trimetazidine-for-stable-angina }}</ref> Recently, an international multicentre retrospective cohort study has indeed shown that in patients with heart failure of different etiologies, the addition of trimetazidine on conventional optimal therapy can improve mortality and morbidity.<ref>Fragasso G, Rosano G, Baek Hong S, Sisakian H, Di Napoli P, Alberti L, Calori G, Kang SM, Sahakyan A, Vitale C, Marazzi G, Margonato A, Belardinelli R. Effect of partial acid oxidation inhibition with trimetazidine on mortality and morbidity in heart failure: results from an international multicentre retrospective cohort study. Int J Cardiol. 2013;163:320-5.</ref>

EMA recommends that doctors should no longer prescribe trimetazidine for the treatment of patients with [[tinnitus]], [[vertigo]] or disturbances in vision.<ref name = "EMA_press_release">{{cite web | url = http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Press_release/2012/06/WC500129070.pdf | title = European Medicines Agency recommends restricting use of trimetazidine-containing medicines | format = pdf | work = Press release | date = 2012-06-12 | publisher = European Medicines Agency }}</ref> The recent EMA evaluation also revealed rare cases (3.6/1 000 000 patient years) of [[Parkinsonian]] (or extrapyramidal) symptoms (such as tremor, rigidity, akinesia, hypertonia), gait instability, [[restless leg syndrome]], other related  movement disorders, majority of patient recovered within 4 months after treatment discontinuation, therefore, doctors are advised not to prescribe the medicine either to patients with Parkinson disease, parkinsonian symptoms, tremors, restless leg syndrome or other related movement disorders, nor to patients with severe renal impairment.<ref name = "EMA_press_release"/>

== Mechanism of action ==

Trimetazidine inhibits [[beta-oxidation]] of [[fatty acid]]s by blocking long-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA [[thiolase]], which enhances glucose oxidation.<ref name = "Kantor_2000">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kantor PF, Lucien A, Kozak R, Lopaschuk GD | title = The antianginal drug trimetazidine shifts cardiac energy metabolism from fatty acid oxidation to glucose oxidation by inhibiting mitochondrial long-chain 3-ketoacyl coenzyme A thiolase | journal = Circ. Res. | volume = 86 | issue = 5 | pages = 580–8 |date=March 2000 | pmid = 10720420 | doi = 10.1161/01.RES.86.5.580  }}</ref> In an ischaemic cell, energy obtained during glucose oxidation requires less oxygen consumption than in the beta-oxidation process. Potentiation of glucose oxidation optimizes cellular energy processes, thereby maintaining proper energy metabolism during ischaemia. By preserving energy metabolism in cells exposed to hypoxia or ischaemia, trimetazidine prevents a decrease in intracellular ATP levels, thereby ensuring the proper functioning of ionic pumps and transmembrane sodium-potassium flow whilst maintaining cellular homeostasis.<ref name = "Stanley_Marzilli_2003">{{cite journal |vauthors=Stanley WC, Marzilli M | title = Metabolic therapy in the treatment of ischaemic heart disease: the pharmacology of trimetazidine | journal = Fundam Clin Pharmacol | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 133–45 |date=April 2003 | pmid = 12667223 | doi = 10.1046/j.1472-8206.2003.00154.x }}</ref>
