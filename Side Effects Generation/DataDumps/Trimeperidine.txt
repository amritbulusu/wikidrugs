'''Trimeperidine''' ([[Promedol]]) is an [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] that is an [[analog (chemistry)|analogue]] of [[prodine]]. It was developed in the early 1950s in the USSR during research into the related drug [[pethidine]].<ref>Назаров И. Н., Простаков Н. С., Швецов Н. И.[http://genchem.ru/ ЖОХ]
, 1956, 26, 2798</ref>  

Trimeperidine has four structural [[isomer]]s, of which two are active, the γ isomer trimeperidine, and the β isomer isopromedol.<ref>Casy AF, McErlane K. Analgesic potency and stereochemistry of trimeperidine and its isomers and analogues. ''Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology''. 1971 Jan;23(1):68-9.</ref> It is around half the potency of [[morphine]] as an analgesic,<ref>Guseva EN. Comparative analgesic effects of promedol, phenadone, tecodine, and morphine. (Russian) ''Farmakologiia i Toksikologiia''. 1956;19(Suppl):17-8.</ref><ref>Bender KI, Gerasimova OV. Relationship between the pain-relieving action of narcotic analgesics and their effect on respiration. (Russian) ''Farmakologiia i Toksikologiia''. 1976 Sep-Oct;39(5):552-6.</ref> and has been widely used for the treatment of pain.<ref>Chernukha EA, Rasstrigin NN. Anesthesia in labor. (Russian) ''Fel'dsher i Akusherka''. 1980;45(6):21-7.</ref><ref>Zhirkova IuV, Stepanenko SM, Butyleva OIu, Zilbert EV, Manerova AF, Golodenko NV.

Trimeperidine produces similar effects to other opioids, such as [[analgesia]] and [[sedation]], along with side effects such as [[nausea]], [[itching]], [[vomiting]] and [[respiratory depression]] which may be harmful or fatal.

Trimeperidine is in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act 1970 of the United States as a Narcotic with ACSCN 9646 with an annual aggregate manufacturing quota of 2 grammes as of 2014.  The free base conversion ratio for salts includes 0.883 for the hydrochloride.<ref>http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/quotas/2014/fr0825.htm</ref>  It is listed under the Single Convention for the Control of Narcotic Substances 1961 and is controlled in most countries in the same fashion as is morphine or heroin.
