'''Omalizumab''', sold under the trade name '''Xolair''', is a medication originally designed to reduce sensitivity to allergens. It has been used to try to control severe allergic [[asthma]], which does not respond to high doses of [[corticosteroids]]. It has been approved for treating people 12 years and older with severe or moderate to severe allergic asthma in more than 90 countries, since its first of such approval in 2002 in Australia. Omalizumab was approved in March 2014 in the European Union and the U.S.A. and in about 10 other countries for treating patients 12 years and above with [[chronic spontaneous urticaria]] (CSU) (also referred to as [[chronic idiopathic urticaria]] or CIU), which cannot be treated with H1-[[antihistamines]]. CSU is not an allergic disease.

Omalizumab is a [[recombinant DNA]]-derived humanized IgG1k [[monoclonal antibody]] that specifically binds to free human [[immunoglobulin E]] (IgE) in the blood and interstitial fluid and to membrane-bound form of IgE (mIgE) on the surface of mIgE-expressing [[B lymphocytes]].<ref name="pmid11704611">{{cite journal | author = Schulman ES | title = Development of a monoclonal anti-immunoglobulin E antibody (omalizumab) for the treatment of allergic respiratory disorders | journal = Am J Respir Crit Care Med| volume = 164 | issue = 8 Pt 2 | pages = S6-11 |date=October 2001 | pmid = 11704611 | doi = 10.1164/ajrccm.164.supplement_1.2103025 }}</ref> Unlike an ordinary anti-IgE antibody, it does not bind to IgE that is already bound by the [[high affinity IgE receptor]] (FcεRI) on the surface of [[mast cells]], [[basophils]], and antigen-presenting [[dendritic cells]].<ref name="pmid17383539">{{cite journal |vauthors=Chang TW, Wu PC, Hsu CL, Hung AF | title = Anti-IgE antibodies for the treatment of IgE-mediated allergic diseases | journal = Adv Immunol. | volume = 93 | pages = 63–119 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17383539 | doi = 10.1016/S0065-2776(06)93002-8 }}</ref>

IgE is commonly involved in [[type I hypersensitivity]], which manifests in the most common allergic diseases. It has been estimated that as high as 20 to 40% of the populations who live a western lifestyle in economically advanced countries are affected by allergy and seek medical help.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aaaai.org/about-the-aaaai/newsroom/allergy-statistics.aspx|title=Allergy Statistics - AAAAI|website=The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology}}</ref> In the U.S., 8% of adults and 10% of children have asthma.<ref>Asthma Statistics.

== Medical uses ==

===Allergic asthma===
Omalizumab received approval by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 2003 for treating patients 12 years and older with moderate to severe allergic asthma.<ref>Xolair - Biological Therapy. Drugdevelopment-technology.com. http://www.drugdevelopment-technology.com/projects/xolair/</ref> It has also received approval in many other countries for treating patients 12 years and older with severe, persistent allergic asthma. Omalizumab was approved by the European Union in 2009 for treating patients 6 to 12 years old with severe, persistent allergic asthma. Thus, its primary use is for patients mostly with severe, persistent allergic asthma, uncontrollable with oral or injectable corticosteroids.<ref name=AFP05>{{cite journal | author = Davydov L | title = Omalizumab (Xolair) for treatment of asthma | journal = Am Fam Physician | volume = 71 | issue = 2 | pages = 341–2 |date=January 2005 | pmid = 15686303 | doi = }}</ref> Those patients have already failed step I to step IV treatments and are in step V of treatment. Such a treatment scheme is consistent with the widely adopted guidelines for the management and prevention of asthma, issued by Global Initiative of Asthma (GINA), which was a medical guidelines organization launched in 1993 in collaboration with the [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute]], [[National Institutes of Health]], USA, and the [[World Health Organization]].<ref>Pocket guide for asthma management and prevention.

Due to the requirement for long-term administration and hence the high cost of an omalizumab treatment regimen, and to the concern over long-term safety, treatment is not yet very common, especially in developing countries where medical funds are relatively scarce.  Another barrier to wide use is its injectable dosage form, which requires the patient to visit a physician's office or clinic every 2 to 4 weeks during treatment. In August 2010, the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence|National Institute for Clinical Excellence]] (NICE) in the United Kingdom ruled that omalizumab should not be prescribed on the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) to children under 12, causing widespread condemnation from asthma charities.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10948091 | work=BBC News | title=Asthma drug ruling 'nonsensical' | date=August 12, 2010}}</ref>  NICE concluded that the high costs of the compound, over £250 per vial, did not represent a sufficiently high increase in quality of life. However, on March 7, 2013, NICE issued “final draft guidance” about the allowance of omalizumab. It recommended the drug as an option for treating severe, persistent allergic asthma in adults, adolescents and children following additional analyses and submission of a patient access scheme (PAS) by [[Novartis]], the manufacturer.<ref>NICE says yes to treatment for asthma in final draft guidance. ''NICE'' March 7, 2013. http://www.nice.org.uk/newsroom/pressreleases/OmalizumabForAsthmaFAD.jsp</ref> Some immunologists have also suggested that because IgE may be a natural defense against parasitic diseases, treatment should not be recommended when living in environments where the presence of parasites is common.

===Chronic spontaneous urticaria===
Xolair was approved in March 2014 in the European Union and the U.S.A. and in about 10 other countries for treating patients 12 years and above with [[chronic spontaneous urticaria]] (also called [[chronic idiopathic urticaria]]), which cannot be treated with elevated doses of H1-[[antihistamines]].

Chronic urticaria affect about 0.5 to 1% of the world population and among those patients, two thirds have CSU, and among them, about half cannot be adequately treated even with high doses (4 times regular doses) of H1-antihistamines.<ref name="pmid19400905">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaplan AP, Greaves M | title = Pathogenesis of chronic urticaria | journal = Clin Exp Allergy | volume = 39 | issue = 6 | pages = 777–87 |date=April 2009 | pmid = 19400905 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2222.2009.03256.x }}</ref><ref name="pmid21083565">{{cite journal |vauthors=Maurer M, Weller K, Bindslev-Jensen C, Giménez-Arnau A, Bousquet PJ, Bousquet J, Canonica GW, Church MK, Godse KV, Grattan CE, Greaves MW, Hide M, Kalogeromitros D, Kaplan AP, Saini SS, Zhu XJ, Zuberbier T | title = Unmet clinical needs in chronic spontaneous urticaria.

==Adverse effects==
The main adverse effect is [[anaphylaxis]] (a life-threatening systemic allergic reaction), with a rate of occurrence of 1 to 2 patients per 1,000.<ref name=AFP05/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Fanta CH |title=Asthma |journal=N.

The allergic reaction is probably not due to the binding characteristics of the antibody drug, but to the protein nature of the antibody{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}. The patients who use omalizumab are generally highly allergic. Thus, even though the drug is administered with the purpose to suppress allergy (including anaphylactic reactions), it does not work immediately after injection.

It also increases the risk of [[stroke]]s and [[heart disease]] by a small amount.<ref name=FDA2014>{{cite web|title=Xolair (omalizumab): Drug Safety Communication - Slightly Elevated Risk of Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Serious Adverse Events|url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm416408.htm|website=fda.gov|accessdate=29 September 2014|date=2014-09-26}}</ref>

The data pooled in 2003 from the earlier phase I to phase III clinical trials showed a numeric imbalance in malignancies arising in omalizumab recipients (0.5%) compared with control subjects (0.2%).<ref name=AFP05/> To clarify this imbalance, a more recent study was performed based on pooled analysis using much more comprehensive data from 67 phase I to IV clinical trials. The prespecified primary analysis assessed the incidence of primary malignancy in 32 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (RDBPC) trials. In this analysis, there were 11,459 unique patients in all clinical trials (7,789 received omalizumab). The primary analysis identified malignancies in 25 patients (RDBPC trials): 14 in 4,254 omalizumab-treated patients and 11 in 3,178 placebo-treated patients. Incidence rates per 1,000 patient-years of observation time for omalizumab- and placebo-treated patients were 4.14 (95% CI, 2.26-6.94) and 4.45 (95% CI, 2.22-7.94), respectively; the corresponding rate ratio was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.39-2.27). Primary malignancies were of varying [[histologic]] type and occurred in a number of different organ systems; no cluster of histologies was identified. The study thus concluded that in this pooled analysis no association was observed between omalizumab treatment and risk of malignancy in RDBPC trials; the rate ratio was below unity. The data suggest that a causal relationship between omalizumab therapy and malignancy is unlikely.<ref name="pmid22365654">{{cite journal |vauthors=Busse W, Buhl R, Fernandez Vidaurre C, Blogg M, Zhu J, Eisner MD, Canvin J | title = Omalizumab and the risk of malignancy: results from a pooled analysis | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 129 | issue = 4 | pages = 983–9.e6 |date=April 2012 | pmid = 22365654 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2012.01.033 }}</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==
Persons with allergy are sensitized to make immune response to several or many proteins contained in one or more of the hundreds of harmless environmental substances, which they take in by inhalation (e.g., [[house dust mite]]s, [[pollens]], [[molds]], pet animal [[dander]], and other airborne allergens) and ingestion (e.g., wheat (gluten), peanuts, [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[shellfish]], and other food allergens), or through the skin (e.g., bee and [[fire ant]] stings, [[latex]] gloves). In these individuals, the IgE molecules, both allergen-specific and allergen-nonspecific ones, in their bodies bind to the [[high affinity IgE receptor]] (FcεRI) on the surface of mast cells and basophils. Under certain conditions, including but not limited to when the allergenic substances are taken in by a sensitized individual at substantial amounts, the allergenic proteins bind to the allergen-specific IgE bound by FcεRI on the surface of mast cells and basophils and trigger the activation of those inflammatory cells, which release a host of pharmacological mediators, such as [[histamine]], [[leukotrienes]], [[tryptase]], inflammatory [[cytokines]], and others, causing various allergic symptoms/diseases.

The rationale for designing the anti-IgE therapeutic antibodies and the pharmacological mechanisms of anti-IgE therapy have been summarized in review articles by the inventor of the anti-IgE therapy, Tse Wen Chang, and his colleagues.<ref name="pmid17383539"/><ref name="pmid10657120">{{cite journal | author = Chang TW | title = The pharmacological basis of anti-IgE therapy | journal = Nat. Biotechnol. | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 157–62 |date=February 2000 | pmid = 10657120 | doi = 10.1038/72601 }}</ref><ref name="pmid16750976">{{cite journal |vauthors=Chang TW, Shiung YY | title = Anti-IgE as a mast cell-stabilizing therapeutic agent | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology| volume = 117 | issue = 6 | pages = 1203–12 |date=June 2006 | pmid = 16750976 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2006.04.005 }}</ref> Omalizumab inhibits the binding of IgE to FcεRI on mast cells and basophils by binding to an antigenic [[epitope]] on IgE that overlaps with the site to which FcεRI binds. This feature is critical to its pharmacological effects because a typical anti-IgE antibody can cross-link cell surface FcεRI-bound IgE, thereby aggregate FcεRI, and activate mast cells and basophils to discharge the horde of chemical mediators stored in the densely packed sacs inside the cells. However, when IgE is bound to the receptor, the antigenic epitope on IgE to which omalizumab binds is sterically hindered by the receptor  and is not accessible to omalizumab binding, thus averting the [[anaphylactic]] effects presumably unavoidable with an ordinary anti-IgE antibody . Furthermore, although the peptide elements on IgE involved in binding to low affinity IgE receptor ([[FcεRII]]) on many cell types are different from the peptide elements involved in binding to FcεRI, omalizumab, by steric hindrance, also prevents binding of IgE to FcεRII. The reduced binding of IgE to both FcεRI and FcεRII has profound effects on the attenuation of IgE-mediated allergic responses.

Perhaps the most dramatic effect, which was not foreseen at the time when the anti-IgE therapy was designed and which was discovered during the clinical trials, is that as the free IgE in patients is depleted by omalizumab, the FcεRI receptors on basophils, mast cells, and dendritic cells are gradually down-regulated with somewhat different kinetics, rendering those cells much less sensitive to the stimulation by allergens.<ref name="pmid9013989">{{cite journal |vauthors=MacGlashan DW, Bochner BS, Adelman DC, Jardieu PM, Togias A, McKenzie-White J, Sterbinsky SA, Hamilton RG, Lichtenstein LM | title = Down-regulation of Fc(epsilon)RI expression on human basophils during in vivo treatment of atopic patients with anti-IgE antibody | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 158 | issue = 3 | pages = 1438–45 |date=February 1997 | pmid = 9013989 | doi = }}</ref><ref name="pmid14657874">{{cite journal |vauthors=Prussin C, Griffith DT, Boesel KM, Lin H, Foster B, Casale TB | title = Omalizumab treatment downregulates dendritic cell FcepsilonRI expression | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 112 | issue = 6 | pages = 1147–54 |date=December 2003 | pmid = 14657874 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2003.10.003  }}</ref><ref name="pmid15748543">{{cite journal | author = Scheinfeld N | title = Omalizumab: a recombinant humanized monoclonal IgE-blocking antibody | journal = Dermatol.

===IgE in allergic diseases===
Corticosteroids of various chemical structures and [[formulations]], which offer various desired potency and [[pharmacokinetics]] and which generally effectively suppress inflammatory processes systemically or locally, have been the mainstay of medicine to treat the severe cases of various allergic diseases. Before the introduction of omalizumab, moderate to severe cases of asthma, regardless of their allergic or non-allergic nature, had been generally treated with corticosteroids and [[bronchodilators]]. Clinicians had not had persuasive reasons to dissect the role of IgE, or more precisely, its relative importance among various immune factors and pharmacological mediators, in the pathogenesis of asthma and various other allergic diseases and conditions. The availability of omalizumab as a drug to intervene the IgE pathway has provided many clinical researchers the opportunities to examine the role of IgE in various allergic diseases and, in some cases, diseases that are not obviously considered as allergic diseases.

In conjunction with achieving the practical goal to investigate the applicability of the anti-IgE therapy as a potential treatment for allergic diseases, the many corporate-sponsored clinical trials of [[TNX-901]] and omalizumab on asthma, allergic rhinitis, peanut allergy, chronic idiopathic urticaria, atopic dermatitis, and other allergic diseases, have helped define the role of IgE in the pathogenesis of these prevalent allergic diseases. For example, the clinical trial results of omalizumab on asthma have unambiguously settled the long debate whether IgE plays a central role in the pathogenesis of asthma.<ref name="pmid15753888" /> The availability of the drug as a treatment option for patients with severe, persistent allergic asthma has gradually persuaded the physicians treating severe asthma patients to determine whether their asthma is allergic or non-allergic in nature.

Numerous investigator-initiated case studies or small-scale pilot studies of omalizumab have been performed on various allergic diseases and several non-allergic diseases, especially inflammatory skin diseases. These diseases include atopic dermatitis, various subtypes of physical urticaria (solar, cold-induced, local heat-induced, or delayed pressure-induced), and a spectrum of relatively less prevalent allergic or non-allergic diseases or conditions, such as [[allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis]],<ref name="pmid17329558">{{cite journal |vauthors=van der Ent CK, Hoekstra H, Rijkers GT | title = Successful treatment of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis with recombinant anti-IgE antibody | journal = Thorax | volume = 62 | issue = 3 | pages = 276–7 |date=March 2007 | pmid = 17329558 | doi = 10.1136/thx.2004.035519 | pmc=2117163}}</ref> cutaneous or systemic [[mastocytosis]], bee venom sensitivity (anaphylaxis),<ref name="pmid20568389">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kontou-Fili K, Filis CI, Voulgari C, Panayiotidis PG | title = Omalizumab monotherapy for bee sting and unprovoked "anaphylaxis" in a patient with systemic mastocytosis and undetectable specific IgE | journal = Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol| volume = 104 | issue = 6 | pages = 537–9 |date=June 2010 | pmid = 20568389 | doi = 10.1016/j.anai.2010.04.011 }}</ref> idiopathic anaphylaxis, eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal disorder, [[bullous pemphigoid]],<ref name="pmid19152970">{{cite journal |vauthors=Fairley JA, Baum CL, Brandt DS, Messingham KA | title = Pathogenicity of IgE in autoimmunity: successful treatment of bullous pemphigoid with omalizumab | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology| volume = 123 | issue = 3 | pages = 704–5 |date=March 2009 | pmid = 19152970 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2008.11.035 | pmc=4784096}}</ref> [[interstitial cystitis]],<ref name="pmid16771742">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee J, Doggweiler-Wiygul R, Kim S, Hill BD, Yoo TJ | title = Is interstitial cystitis an allergic disorder?: A case of interstitial cystitis treated successfully with anti-IgE | journal = Int J Urol.| volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 631–4 |date=May 2006 | pmid = 16771742 | doi = 10.1111/j.1442-2042.2006.01373.x }}</ref> nasal polyps, and idiopathic [[angiodema]],.<ref name="pmid17931567">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sands MF, Blume JW, Schwartz SA | title = Successful treatment of 3 patients with recurrent idiopathic angioedema with omalizumab | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology| volume = 120 | issue = 4 | pages = 979–81 |date=October 2007 | pmid = 17931567 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2007.07.041 }}</ref> The generally positive results have suggested that IgE possibly plays a key role, either directly or indirectly, in these diseases and, therefore, intervening the IgE pathway may be an effective therapeutic strategy.

===Roles in non-allergic diseases===
Several groups have reported clinical trial results that omalizumab may be effective in patients with non-allergic asthma.<ref name="pmid23350994">{{cite journal | author = de Llano LP, Vennera Mdel C, Álvarez FJ, Medina JF, Borderías L, Pellicer C, González H, Gullón JA, Martínez-Moragón E, Sabadell C, Zamarro S, Picado C; Spanish Registry | title = Effects of omalizumab in non-atopic asthma: results from a Spanish multicenter registry | journal = J Asthma | volume = 50 | issue = 3 | pages = 296–301 |date=April 2013 | pmid = 23350994 | doi = 10.3109/02770903.2012.757780 }}</ref> This seems to be contrary to the general understanding of the pharmacological mechanisms of the anti-IgE therapy discussed above.<ref name="pmid23709757">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lommatzsch M, Korn S, Buhl R, Virchow JC | title = Against all odds: anti-IgE for intrinsic asthma? | journal = Thorax |date=May 2013 | pmid = 23709757 | doi = 10.1136/thoraxjnl-2013-203738 | volume=69 | issue=1 | pages=94–6 | pmc=3888607}}</ref> Furthermore, among the diseases in which omalizumab has been studied for efficacy and safety, some are not allergic diseases, because hypersensitivity reactions toward external antigens is not involved.

For the remaining cases of chronic idiopathic urticaria and those of the different subtypes of physical urticaria, the internal abnormalities leading to the disease manifestation have not been identified. Notwithstanding these developments, it is apparent that many of those diseases involve inflammatory reactions in the skin and the activation of mast cells.

== History ==
[[Tanox]], a [[biopharmaceutical]] company based in Houston, Texas, started the anti-IgE program, created antibody drug candidates, and filed its first patent application on the anti-IgE therapeutic approach in 1987.<ref name="The Scientist">Twombly R. Couple Lead Quest for New Allergy Drug. ''The Scientist'' January 7, 1991. http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/11548/title/Couple-Lead-Quest-For-New-Allergy-Drug/.</ref> In the next year, the company converted one candidate antibody to a chimeric antibody (which was later named CGP51901 and further developed into a humanized antibody, [[TNX-901]] or [[talizumab]]). The anti-IgE therapeutic concept was not well received in the early period of the program. In order to seek  funding for the anti-IgE program, the two scientist founders of Tanox, [[Nancy T. Chang]] and Tse Wen Chang, visited about 25 pharmaceutical and larger biotech companies in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Japan, and other countries to discuss collaboration throughout 1989. Representatives of [[Ciba-Geigy]] (which merged with [[Sandoz]] to form Novartis in 1996) thought the anti-IgE program scientifically interesting and executives from Tanox and Ciba-Geigy signed a collaborative agreement in 1990 to develop the anti-IgE program.<ref name="The Scientist"/><ref>Development and Licensing Agreement, between Tanox and Ciba-Geigy 1990. http://contracts.onecle.com/tanox/ciba-geigy.rd.1990.05.11.shtml</ref>

In 1991, after several rounds of pre-IND ("[[investigational new drug]]") meetings with officials/scientists of the FDA, the FDA finally gave a nod for CGP51901 to be tested in human subjects. This approval of IND for an anti-IgE antibody for the first time was regarded a brave demonstration of professionalism for both the FDA officials and the Tanox/Ciba-Geigy team. The scientists participating in the pre-IND discussion comprehended that an ordinary anti-IgE antibody (i.e., one without the set of binding specificity of CGP51901) would invariably activate mast cells and basophils and cause anaphylactic shocks and probably deaths among injected persons. Notwithstanding this concern, they came to the same view that based on the presented scientific data, CGP51901 should have an absolutely required clean distinction from an ordinary anti-IgE antibody in this regard.<ref name="pmid1369991">{{cite journal |vauthors=Chang TW, Davis FM, Sun NC, Sun CR, ((MacGlashan DW Jr)), Hamilton RG | title = Monoclonal antibodies specific for human IgE-producing B cells: a potential therapeutic for IgE-mediated allergic diseases | journal = Biotechnology (N Y) | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 122–6 |date=February 1990 | pmid = 1369991 | doi = 10.1038/nbt0290-122 }}</ref><ref name="pmid8362344">{{cite journal |vauthors=Davis FM, Gossett LA, Pinkston KL, Liou RS, Sun LK, Kim YW, Chang NT, Chang TW, Wagner K, Bews J, Brinkmann V, Towbin H, Subramanian N, Heusser C | title = Can anti-IgE be used to treat allergy? | journal = Springer Semin Immunopathol. | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–73 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8362344 | doi = 10.1007/BF00204626 }}</ref> In 1991-1993, researchers from Ciba-Geigy and Tanox and a leading clinical research group (headed by Stephen Holgate) in the asthma/allergy field ran a successful Phase I human clinical trial of CGP51901 in [[Southampton, England]] and showed that the tested antibody is safe.<ref name="pmid9062345">{{cite journal |vauthors=Corne J, Djukanovic R, Thomas L, Warner J, Botta L, Grandordy B, Gygax D, Heusser C, Patalano F, Richardson W, Kilchherr E, Staehelin T, Davis F, Gordon W, Sun L, Liou R, Wang G, Chang TW, Holgate S | title = The effect of intravenous administration of a chimeric anti-IgE antibody on serum IgE levels in atopic subjects: efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics | journal = J Clin Invest. | volume = 99 | issue = 5 | pages = 879–87 |date=March 1997 | pmid = 9062345 | doi = 10.1172/JCI119252 | pmc=507895}}</ref> In 1994-1995, the Tanox/Ciba-Geigy team conducted a Phase II trial of CGP51901 in patients with severe allergic rhinitis in Texas and showed that CGP51901 is safe and efficacious in relieving allergic symptoms.<ref name="pmid9433396">{{cite journal |vauthors=Racine-Poon A, Botta L, Chang TW, Davis FM, Gygax D, Liou RS, Rohane P, Staehelin T, van Steijn AM, Frank W | title = Efficacy, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of CGP 51901, an anti-immunoglobulin E chimeric monoclonal antibody, in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis | journal = Clin Pharmacol Ther. | volume = 62 | issue = 6 | pages = 675–90 |date=December 1997 | pmid = 9433396 | doi = 10.1016/S0009-9236(97)90087-4 }}</ref>

While the Tanox/Ciba-Geigy anti-IgE program was gaining momentum, Genentech announced in 1993 that it also had an anti-IgE program for developing antibody therapeutics for asthma and other allergic diseases. Scientists in Genentech had made a mouse anti-IgE monoclonal antibody with the binding specificity similar to that of CGP51901 and subsequently humanized the antibody (the antibody was later named "omalizumab").<ref name="pmid8360482">{{cite journal |vauthors=Presta LG, Lahr SJ, Shields RL, Porter JP, Gorman CM, Fendly BM, Jardieu PM | title = Humanization of an antibody directed against IgE | journal = Journal of Immunology| volume = 151 | issue = 5 | pages = 2623–32 |date=September 1993 | pmid = 8360482 }}</ref> This caused great concerns in Tanox, because it had disclosed its anti-IgE technology and sent its anti-IgE antibody candidate, which was to become CGP51901 and TNX-901, to Genentech in 1989 for the latter to evaluate for the purpose of considering establishing a corporate partnership.<ref name= "Drug War">Thorpe H.

==Dosing and administration==
[[File:Xolair.jpg|thumb|Xolair (omalizumab) package with powder and solvent phials]]
Omalizumab is administered [[subcutaneous injection|subcutaneously]] once every 2 or 4 weeks. For each patient, the dosing schedule (2 ''vs'' 4 weeks between injections; and the amount of omalizumab, in milligrams, for each injection) is determined according to the serum IgE level and the body weight of the patient.<ref>Dosing and Administration. Dosing and administration guidelines for XOLAIR. http://www.xolairhcp.com/xolairhcp/dosing-and-administration.html</ref> The underlying rationale is that the IgE present at the time of the first injection and produced during the intervals of successive injections must all be neutralized by omalizumab. The product label of Xolair initially approved by FDA covers patients with serum IgE in the range of 30 to about 700 IU/ml (international units per milliliter).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://dermatology.cdlib.org/111/reviews/omalizub/tables.htm|title=Omalizumab: A a recombinant humanized monoclonal IgE blocking antibody|first=Scheinfeld, Noah MD|last=JD|date=1 January 2005|publisher=|journal=Dermatology Online Journal|volume=11|issue=1}}</ref> A clinical development effort is on-going to expand the coverage of patients with serum IgE up to 1500 IU/ml.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctri.nic.in/Clinicaltrials/pmaindet2.php?trialid=1283|title=CTRI|website=www.ctri.nic.in}}</ref>

As of May 10, 2008, the company began requiring that the drug be administered by a patient's health care provider, due to a risk of anaphylaxis. Previously, the drug could be self-administered.

Omalizumab was for several years provided only in a dry powder formulation, which requires the reconstitution with a prepacked solvent with the help of a shaker at the treating clinician’s office before injection. A prefilled syringe liquid formulation has become available in many countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/documents/community-register/html/h319.htm|title=Community register of medicinal products for human use|website=ec.europa.eu}}</ref>

For the administration in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (or chronic idiopathic urticaria), the dosage is uniform, 300&nbsp;mg per four weeks, subcutaneous, regardless of serum IgE levels and body weight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novartis.com/newsroom/media-releases/en/2014/1770973.shtml|title=Global Novartis News - Novartis|website=Novartis}}</ref>

== Manufacturing ==

Omalizumab is a [[glycosylated]] IgG1 monoclonal antibody produced by cells of an adapted [[Chinese hamster ovary]] (CHO) cell line.<ref name="pmid17383539"/> The antibody molecules are secreted by the host cells in a [[cell culture]] process employing large-scale [[bioreactor]]s. At the end of culturing, the IgG contained in the medium is purified by an affinity-column using [[Protein A]] as the adsorbent, followed by [[chromatography]] steps, and finally concentrated by UF/DF (paired ultra filtration/depth filtration).  Currently, Omalizumab is manufactured at the Novartis' [[Huningue]] manufacturing site (France)<ref>http://www.ville-huningue.fr/fr/entreprises-industries-huningue-haut-rhin-68/novartis-biotechnologie.html</ref> through a partnership agreement with Genentech.
