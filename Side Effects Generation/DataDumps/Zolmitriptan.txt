'''Zolmitriptan''' is a selective [[serotonin receptor agonist]] of the 1B and 1D subtypes. It is a [[triptan]], used in the acute treatment of [[migraine]] attacks with or without [[aura (symptom)|aura]] and [[cluster headache]]s.

Zolmitriptan is marketed by [[AstraZeneca]] with the brand names '''Zomig''', '''Zomigon''' (Argentina, Canada & Greece), '''AscoTop''' (Germany) and '''Zomigoro''' (France). In 2008, Zomig generated nearly $154 million in sales.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://drugtopics.modernmedicine.com/drugtopics/data/articlestandard//drugtopics/192009/597083/article.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090521090922/http://drugtopics.modernmedicine.com:80/drugtopics/data/articlestandard/drugtopics/192009/597083/article.pdf |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2009-05-21 |title="2008 Top 200 generic drugs by retail dollars"  }} &nbsp;{{small|(332&nbsp;KB)}}.

AstraZeneca's U.S. patent on Zomig tablets expired on November 14, 2012, and its pediatric exclusivity extension expired on May 14, 2013.<ref>http://www.drugs.com/availability/generic-zomig-zmt.html</ref> The patent in certain European countries has already expired too, and generic drug maker [[Actavis]] released a generic version in those countries, starting in March 2012.<ref>http://www.actavis.com/en/media+center/newsroom/articles/migraine_zolmitriptan_eu.htm</ref>

== Description ==
Zolmitriptan is a synthetic [[tryptamine]] derivative and appears as a white powder that is partially soluble in water.

== Indications ==
Zolmitriptan is used for the acute treatment of migraines with or without aura in adults. Zolmitriptan is not intended for the prophylactic therapy of migraine or for use in the management of hemiplegic or basilar migraine.

Zolmitriptan is available as a swallowable tablet, an oral disintegrating tablet, and a nasal spray, in doses of 2.5 and 5&nbsp;mg.  People who get migraines from aspartame should not use the disintegrating tablet (Zomig ZMT), which contains aspartame.<ref>{{cite journal

== Contraindications and precautions ==
Zolmitriptan should not be given to patients with ischemic heart disease ([[angina pectoris]], history of [[myocardial infarction]], or documented silent ischemia) or to patients who have symptoms or findings consistent with ischemic heart disease, [[coronary artery vasospasm]], including [[Prinzmetal's angina]], or other significant underlying cardiovascular disease.

Zolmitriptan may increase [[blood pressure]], it should not be given to patients with uncontrolled hypertension, should not be used within 24 hours of treatment with another 5-HT1 agonist, or an ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medication like [[dihydroergotamine]] or [[methysergide]], and should not be administered to patients with hemiplegic or basilar migraine.

Concurrent administration of [[MAOI]] or use of zolmitriptan within 2 weeks of discontinuation of MAO-A inhibitor therapy is contraindicated.

== Adverse reactions ==

The Zomig ZMT dissolvable pill contains aspartame, and should be avoided by anyone sensitive to that ingredient and by those suffering from [[phenylketonuria]].

Rarely, serious cardiac events, including [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack), have been associated with zolmitriptan.

Reported minor [[adverse drug reaction|adverse reaction]]s include: [[hypesthesia]], [[paresthesia]] (all types), warm and cold sensations, [[chest pain]], throat and jaw tightness, dry mouth, [[dyspepsia]], [[dysphagia]], [[nausea]], [[somnolence]], [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], [[asthenia]], [[myalgia]], [[muscle weakness|myasthenia]] and [[sweating]].

Drug Interactions: see Zomig package insert for complete list: [http://www1.astrazeneca-us.com/pi/Zomig.pdf ]

Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and AUC of zolmitriptan and its active metabolites were approximately doubled (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY in product pamphlet).  Cimetidine (INN) ({{IPAc-en|s|ᵻ|ˈ|m|ɛ|t|ᵻ|d|iː|n}} or {{IPAc-en|s|aɪ|ˈ|m|ɛ|t|ᵻ|d|iː|n}}) is a histamine H2-receptor antagonist that inhibits the production of acid in the stomach.
