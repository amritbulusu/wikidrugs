'''Ciclopirox olamine''' is a synthetic [[Antifungal medication|antifungal]] agent for topical [[dermatology|dermatologic]] treatment of [[Mycosis#Superficial mycoses|superficial mycoses]].  It is most useful against ''[[Tinea versicolor]]''.<ref name="urlantifung">{{cite web |url=http://faculty.swosu.edu/scott.long/phcl/antifung.htm |title=antifung |work= |accessdate=2008-07-09}}</ref>   It is sold under many brand names worldwide.<ref name=brands>Drugs.com [http://www.drugs.com/international/ciclopirox.html International brand names for ciclopirox] Page accessed January 201, 2016</ref>

==Indications for use== 
Ciclopirox is indicated for the treatment of [[tinea pedis]] and [[tinea corporis]] due to ''[[Trichophyton rubrum]], [[Trichophyton mentagrophytes]]'' and ''[[Epidermophyton floccosum]]'', as well as [[seborrheic dermatitis]]. It is not to be used in the eyes or vagina, and nursing women should consult their doctors before use, since it is not known whether ciclopirox passes into human milk. A burning sensation may be felt when first applying ciclopirox (Paddock Laboratories, Inc., Oct. 2009).

==Mechanism of action== 
In contrast to the [[azole]]s and other antimycotic drugs, the [[mechanism of action]] of ciclopirox is poorly understood.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Niewerth M, Kunze D, Seibold M, Schaller M, Korting HC, Hube B | title = Ciclopirox Olamine Treatment Affects the Expression Pattern of Candida albicans Genes Encoding Virulence Factors, Iron Metabolism Proteins, and Drug Resistance Factors | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy |date=June 2003 | volume = 47 | issue = 6 | pages = 1805–17 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.47.6.1805-1817.2003 | pmid = 12760852 | pmc = 155814}}</ref>  However, loss of function of certain [[catalase]] and [[peroxidase]] enzymes has been implicated as the mechanism of action, as well as various other components of cellular metabolism. In a study conducted to further elucidate ciclopirox's mechanism, several ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' mutants were screened and tested. Results from interpretation of the effects of both the drug treatment and mutation suggested that ciclopirox may exert its effect by disrupting DNA repair, cell division signals and structures (mitotic spindles) as well as some elements of intracellular transport.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Leem SH, Park JE, Kim IS, Chae JY, Sugino A, Sunwoo Y |title=The possible mechanism of action of ciclopirox olamine in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae |journal=Mol.

It acts by inhibiting the membrane transfer system by interrupting the [[Na+/K+-ATPase|Na<sup>+</sup> K<sup>+</sup> ATPase]].<ref name="pmid12760852">{{cite journal |vauthors=Niewerth M, Kunze D, Seibold M, Schaller M, Korting HC, Hube B |title=Ciclopirox olamine treatment affects the expression pattern of Candida albicans genes encoding virulence factors, iron metabolism proteins, and drug resistance factors |journal=Antimicrob.

Initial results show similar efficacy to ketoconazole with a relative increase in subjective symptom relief due to its inherent anti-inflammatory properties.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ratnavel RC, Squire RA, Boorman GC |title=Clinical efficacies of shampoos containing ciclopirox olamine (1.5%) and ketoconazole (2.0%) in the treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis |journal=J Dermatolog Treat |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=88–96 |year=2007 |pmid=17520465 |doi=10.1080/16537150601092944}}</ref>

Ciclopirox  is a considered a hydroxypyrimidine antifungal agent (Paddock Laboratories, Inc., Oct. 2009).

==Efficacy in treating nail infections== 
In addition to other formulations, ciclopirox is used in [[Nail polish|lacquers]] for topical treatment of [[onychomycosis]] (fungal infections of the nails). A [[meta-analysis]] of the six trials of nail infections available in 2009 concluded that they provided evidence that topical ciclopiroxolamine had poor cure rates and that [[amorolfine]] might be substantially more effective, but more research was required.

"Combining data from 2 trials of ciclopiroxolamine versus placebo found treatments failure rates of 61% and 64% for ciclopiroxolamine. These outcomes followed long treatment times (48 weeks) and this makes ciclopiroxolamine a poor choice for nail infections. Better results were observed with the use of amorolfine lacquer; 6% treatment failure rates were found after 1 month of treatment but these data were collected on a very small sample of people and these high rates of success might be unreliable."<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001434.pub2 | title=Topical treatments for fungal infections of the skin and nails of the foot. | year=1996 | journal=Reviews | vauthors=Crawford F}}</ref>
