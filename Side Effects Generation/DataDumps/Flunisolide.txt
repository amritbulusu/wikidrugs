'''Flunisolide''' (marketed as '''AeroBid''', '''Nasalide''', '''Nasarel''') is a [[corticosteroid]] often prescribed as treatment for [[allergic rhinitis]].<ref>See http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00180</ref> Intranasal corticosteroids are the most effective medication for controlling symptoms. <ref name="auto">{{cite journal|title=The diagnosis and management of rhinitis: an updated practice parameter|journal=Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=Aug 2008|pmid=18662584|doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2008.06.003|volume=122|pages=S1-84}}</ref>  In the [[United Kingdom]] it was formerly marketed as '''Syntaris''', but this was recently discontinued by the manufacturers.<ref>See {{cite web |url=http://www.pharphar.com/v/Syntaris |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826115744/http://www.pharphar.com/v/Syntaris |archivedate=2014-08-26 |df= }}</ref>

The principal mechanism of action of flunisolide is to activate [[glucocorticoid]] receptors, meaning it has an [[anti-inflammatory]] action. The effects of topical corticosteroids is not immediate and requires regular use and at least a few days to start experiencing noticeable symptom relief.  As-needed use has been shown to be not as effective as regular recommended use. <ref name="auto"/> Flunisolide should not be used in the presence of nasal infection.  It should not be continued if there is no relief of symptoms after regular use over two to three weeks. <ref name="nih.gov">{{cite web|url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8ba9cc1c-55e5-40ed-9efe-f7abb73976ea|title=DailyMed|publisher=}}</ref>

==Side effects==
Temporary nose and throat dryness, irritation, bleeding or unpleasant taste or smell may occur.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/flunisolide-nasal/page2.htm|title=FLUNISOLIDE - NASAL (Nasalide, Nasarel) side effects, medical uses, and drug interactions - Page 2|publisher=}}</ref>  [[Nasal septum perforation]] is rarely reported. <ref name="auto"/>  Rare, but localized infections of the nose and pharynx with ''[[Candida albicans]]'' have been reported and long-term use may raise the chance of cataracts or glaucoma.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/flunisolide-nasal-patient-drug-information?source=search_result&search=flunisolide&selectedTitle=3~14|title=Content Not Available|publisher=}}</ref>  

Flunisolide nasal spray is absorbed into the [[circulatory system]] (blood).<ref name="nih.gov"/> Corticosteroid nasal sprays may affect the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] function in humans.<ref name="rxlist.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.rxlist.com/nasalide-drug/clinical-pharmacology.htm|title=Nasalide (Flunisolide (Nasal Spray)) Drug Information: Clinical Pharmacology - Prescribing Information at RxList|publisher=}}</ref> After the desired clinical effect is obtained, the [[maintenance dose]] should be reduced to the smallest amount necessary to control symptoms, which can be as low as 1 spray in each nostril a day. Utilizing the [[Effective dose (pharmacology)|minimum effective dose]] will reduce possibility of side effects.<ref name="rxlist.com"/>Recommended amounts of intranasal corticosteroids are generally not associated with [[Systemic effect|systemic]] side effects.

Corticosteroids inhibit wound healing.  Therefore, use of corticosteroid nasal sprays in patients who have experienced recent nasal septal ulcers, recurrent [[epistaxis]], nasal surgery or trauma, a nasal corticosteroid should be used with caution until healing has occurred.<ref name="nih.gov"/>  In pregnancy, recommended doses of intranasal corticosteroids are safe and effective.<ref name="auto"/>
