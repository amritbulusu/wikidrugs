'''Valdecoxib''' is a [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] (NSAID) used in the treatment of [[osteoarthritis]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and painful [[menstruation]] and menstrual symptoms. It is a selective [[cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor]].

Valdecoxib was manufactured and marketed under the brand name '''Bextra''' by [[G. D. Searle & Company]] as an anti-inflammatory arthritis drug.<ref name="CNN_2009" /> It was approved by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] on November 20, 2001, to treat arthritis and menstrual cramps.<ref name="NYT_2009" /><ref>Thomson Micromedex.

A water-soluble and injectable [[prodrug]] of valdecoxib, [[parecoxib]] is marketed in the [[European Union]] under the tradename Dynastat.

==Uses until 2005==
In the [[United States]], the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved valdecoxib for the treatment of [[osteoarthritis]], adult [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and primary [[dysmenorrhea]].<ref name = "Off-label">{{cite web | url = http://www.stopmedicarefraud.gov/pfizerfactsheet.html | title = Pfizer to pay $2.3 billion to resolve criminal and civil health care liability relating to fraudulent marketing and the payment of kickbacks | publisher = Stop Medicare Fraud, US Dept of Health & Human Svc, and of Justice | accessdate = 2012-07-04}}</ref>

Valdecoxib was also used [[off-label]] for controlling acute [[pain]] and various types of surgical pain.<ref name = "Off-label" />

==Side-effects and withdrawal from market==
On April 7, 2005, Pfizer withdrew Bextra from the U.S. market on recommendation by the FDA, citing an increased risk of [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and [[stroke]] and also the risk of a serious, sometimes fatal, skin reaction. This was a result of recent attention to prescription [[NSAIDs]], such as [[Merck & Co.|Merck's]] [[Rofecoxib|Vioxx]]. Other reported side-effects were [[Angina pectoris|angina]] and [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]].

Pfizer first acknowledged cardiovascular risks associated with Bextra in October 2004. The [[American Heart Association]] soon after was presented with a report indicating patients using Bextra while recovering from heart surgery were 2.19 times more likely to suffer a stroke or heart attack than those taking [[placebos]].

In a large study published in [[The Journal of the American Medical Association]] in 2006, valdecoxib appeared less adverse for renal (kidney) disease and heart arrhythmia compared to Vioxx, however elevated renal risks were slightly suggested.<ref name="JAMA">{{cite journal |url=http://www.cox2drugreview.org |title=Adverse Effects of Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors on Renal and Arrhythmia Events: Meta-Analysis of Randomized Trials |journal=JAMA |date=2006 |last1=Zhang |first1=J J. |last2=Ding |first2=E.

==2009 settlement for off-label uses promotions==
{{Undue weight section|date=December 2012}}
On September 2, 2009, the [[United States Department of Justice]] fined Pfizer $2.3 billion after one of its [[subsidiaries]], Pharmacia & UpJohn Company, pleaded guilty to marketing four drugs including Bextra "with the intent to defraud or mislead."<ref name="BBC">{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8234533.stm |title=Pfizer agrees record fraud fine |work=BBC}}</ref> Pharmacia & UpJohn admitted to criminal conduct in the promotion of Bextra, and agreed to pay the largest criminal fine ever imposed in the United States for any matter, $1.195 billion.<ref>http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/ma/Press%20Office%20-%20Press%20Release%20Files/Sept2009/PharmaciaPlea.html</ref> A former Pfizer district sales manager was [[indicted]] and sentenced to home confinement for destroying documents regarding the illegal promotion of Bextra.<ref>http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/ma/Press%20Office%20-%20Press%20Release%20Files/Mar2009/FarinaconvictionPR.html</ref><ref>http://industry.bnet.com/pharma/10002882/pfizers-off-label-bextra-team-were-called-the-highlanders/</ref> In addition, a Regional Manager pleaded guilty to distribution of a mis-branded product, and was fined $75,000 and twenty-four months on probation.<ref>http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/ma/Press%20Office%20-%20Press%20Release%20Files/June2009/HollowayMarySentencingPR.html</ref>

The remaining $1 billion of the fine was paid to resolve allegations under the civil [[False Claims Act]] case and is the largest civil fraud settlement against a pharmaceutical company. Six whistle-blowers were awarded more than $102 million for their role in the investigation.<ref>https://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel09/justice_090209.htm</ref> Former Pfizer sales representative John Kopchinski acted as a [[qui tam]] relator and filed a complaint in 2004 outlining the illegal conduct in the marketing of Bextra.<ref>http://www.phillipsandcohen.com/CM/NewsSettlements/NewsSettlements536.asp</ref> Kopchinski was awarded $51.5 million for his role in the case because the improper marketing of Bextra was the largest piece of the settlement at $1.8 billion.<ref>http://www.phillipsandcohen.com/CM/NewsSettlements/NewsSettlements531.asp</ref>
