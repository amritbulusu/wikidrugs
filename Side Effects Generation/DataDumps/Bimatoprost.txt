'''Bimatoprost''' (marketed in the US, Canada and Europe by [[Allergan]], under the trade name '''Lumigan''') is a [[prostaglandin]] analog used topically (as [[eye drop]]s) to control the progression of [[glaucoma]] and in the management of [[ocular hypertension]].  It reduces [[intraocular pressure]] (IOP) by increasing the outflow of [[aqueous humor|aqueous fluid]] from the eyes.<ref name=MedlinePlus>{{cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a602030.html |title=Bimatoprost Ophthalmic |publisher=[[MedlinePlus]] |date=January 1, 2003 |accessdate=2007-11-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005013222/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a602030.html |archivedate=2007-10-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> In December 2008, the indication to lengthen [[eyelash]]es was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA); the cosmetic formulation of bimatoprost is sold as '''Latisse''' {{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|t|iː|s}}.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D95AF4N81.htm |title=Allergan gets FDA approval for eyelash treatment |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[BusinessWeek]] |date=December 26, 2008 |accessdate=December 26, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229052357/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D95AF4N81.htm |archivedate=December 29, 2008 |df= }}</ref>

==Uses==
===Medical===
Bimatoprost is used for the treatment of [[open-angle glaucoma]] and ocular hypertension in adult patients, either alone or in combination with a [[beta blocker]]<ref name="AC">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2015|language=German}}</ref><ref name="Drugs.com">[[Drugs.com]]: Bimatoprost {{drugs.com|monograph|bimatoprost}}.</ref> (typically [[timolol]]).

Studies have shown bimatoprost to be more effective than timolol in reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) and as least as effective as the prostaglandin analogs [[latanoprost]] and [[travoprost]] in reducing IOP.<ref name="pmid19929032">{{cite journal| author=Curran MP| title=Bimatoprost: a review of its use in open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension | journal=Drugs Aging | year= 2009 | volume= 26 | issue= 12 | pages= 1049–71 | pmid=19929032 | doi=10.2165/11203210-000000000-00000 }}</ref>

===Cosmetic===
{{COI|section|date=July 2015}}
In patients using ophthalmic prostaglandins such as travoprost and latanoprost, it has been noted that there had been an increase in diameter, density and length of eyelashes. A study published in May 2010 found that bimatoprost in a gel suspension, when applied at the base of the upper eyelid eyelashes, significantly increased eyelash length.{{fact|date=July 2016}} Allergan initiated clinical trials investigating the usage of bimatoprost as a cosmetic drug.<ref name="WSJ-19-11-2007">{{cite news | title=Drug That Lengthens Eyelashes Sets Off Flutter | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119543055372597359 | date=2007-11-19 | work = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | accessdate=2007-11-19 | first=Rhonda L. | last=Rundle}}</ref> In 2008, the FDA Dermatologic and Ophthalmic Drugs Advisory Committee voted to approve bimatoprost for the cosmetic use of darkening and lengthening eyelashes.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Grady|first1=Scott|title=Latisse (Bimatoprost) is Approved by the FDA in 2008|url=http://chiclatisse.com/blogs/news/16004075-latisse-bimatoprost-is-approved-by-the-fda-in-2008|website=ChicLatisse.com|accessdate=22 August 2014|ref=19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120323/http://chiclatisse.com/blogs/news/16004075-latisse-bimatoprost-is-approved-by-the-fda-in-2008|archivedate=26 August 2014|df=}}</ref> The medical term for this is treatment of [[hypotrichosis]]; however, the FDA approval is for purely cosmetic purposes (see [[Prostaglandin F receptor#Clinical Significance]]).<ref name=ThePinkSheet15Dec2008>The Pink Sheet: [http://www.thepinksheet.com] Lauren Smith, December 15, 2008; Volume 70, Number 050.</ref><ref name="pmid25601618">{{cite journal | vauthors = Choi YM, Diehl J, Levins PC | title = Promising alternative clinical uses of prostaglandin F2α analogs: beyond the eyelashes | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology | volume = 72 | issue = 4 | pages = 712–6 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25601618 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaad.2014.10.012 | url = }}</ref>{{verify source|date=December 2011}}

==Side effects==
Side effects are similar to other prostaglandin analogs applied to the eye. The most common one is [[conjunctival hyperemia]], which occurs in more than 10% of patients. Other effects include blurred vision, eye and eyelid redness, eye burning or other discomfort, and permanent darkening of the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] to brown.<ref name="AC" /><ref name="Drugs.com" /><ref name=Label>[http://www.allergan.com/assets/pdf/latisse_pi.pdf Latisse prescribing information]</ref> Occasional adverse effects (in less than 1% of patients) are headache and nausea.<ref name="AC" />

Some side effects are specific to the cosmetic formulation, which is applied to the skin at the base of the eyelash rather than instilled into the eye. These include infection if the one-time applicators are reused, and darkening of the eyelid or of the area beneath the eye.<ref name=Label /><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/health/02latisse.html "Long Lashes Without Prescription, but With Risks"]. Catherine Saint Louis. ''[[The New York Times]]''. May 1, 2010</ref> Research suggests that wiping the eye with an absorbent pad after the administration of eye drops can result in shorter eyelashes and a lesser chance of hyperpigmentation in the eyelid, compared to not wiping off excess fluid.<ref name="Xu">{{cite journal |author=Xu L, Wang X, Wu M |title= Topical medication instillation techniques for glaucoma |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume= |issue=2|pages= CD010520 |date=2017 |pmid= 28218404|doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD010520.pub2}}</ref>

==Interactions==
No interaction studies with this substance have been performed. Interactions with systemic (for example, oral) drugs are considered unlikely because bimatoprost does not reach relevant concentrations in the bloodstream. Bimatoprost does not negatively interact with timolol eye drops.<ref name="AC" />

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===
Bimatoprost is a [[structural analog]] of [[prostaglandin F2α|prostaglandin F<sub>2α</sub>]] (PGF<sub>2α</sub>). Like other PGF<sub>2α</sub> analogs such as travoprost, latanoprost and [[tafluprost]], it increases the outflow of aqueous fluid from the eye and lowers intraocular pressure. However, in contrast to these it does not act on the [[prostaglandin F receptor]], nor on any other known prostaglandin receptor. It is thought that bimatoprost mimics the human body's own [[prostamide]]s (which are chemically similar), a class of substances related to prostaglandins, but with an unknown mechanism of action.<ref name="AC" /><ref name="Drugs.com" /> No prostamide [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] has been identified {{as of|2015|lc=on}}; the search is ongoing.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=25960577|pmc=4422110|year=2015|author1=Shelnut|first1=E. L.|title=Design and synthesis of novel prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> ethanolamide and glycerol ester probes for the putative prostamide receptor(s)|journal=Tetrahedron Letters|volume=56|issue=11|pages=1411–1415|last2=Nikas|first2=S. P.|last3=Finnegan|first3=D. F.|last4=Chiang|first4=N|last5=Serhan|first5=C. N.|last6=Makriyannis|first6=A|doi=10.1016/j.tetlet.2015.01.164}}</ref>

===Pharmacokinetics===
Bimatoprost is well absorbed through the [[cornea]]. It starts lowering intraocular pressure after four hours, lasting for at least 24 hours. A low percentage enters the bloodstream. In the blood plasma, peak concentrations are reached after 10 minutes, then drop below the detection limit of 25 [[picogram|pg]]/ml after 1.5 hours. The substance does not [[Bioaccumulation|accumulate]] in the body.<ref name="AC" /><ref name="Drugs.com" />

[[Plasma protein binding]] is 88%. Bimatoprost is metabolized by oxidation, ''N''-[[ethyl group|deethylation]] and [[glucuronidation]], forming a variety of [[metabolite]]s. Biological half-life was measured to be 45 minutes after [[intravenous]] infusion. 67% are eliminated via the kidney, and 25% via the feces.<ref name="AC" /><ref name="Drugs.com" />
