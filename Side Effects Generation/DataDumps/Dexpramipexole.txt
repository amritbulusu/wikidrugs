'''Dexpramipexole''' ('''KNS-760704''') is a drug that was investigated by Knopp Biosciences and [[Biogen Idec]] for the treatment of [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.  The drug failed to show efficacy in terms of function or survival in a [[Clinical trial#Phases|Phase III]] study of patients with ALS.<ref name="PhaseIIIPR">{{cite web|title=Biogen Idec Reports Top-Line Results from Phase 3 Trial Investigating Dexpramipexole in People with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)|url=http://www.biogenidec.com/PRESS_RELEASE_DETAILS.aspx?ID=5981&ReqId=1770780|publisher=Biogen Idec|accessdate=4 January 2013}}</ref>

In September 2009, dexpramipexole received [[FDA Fast Track Development Program|Fast Track]] designation for ALS from the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).<ref>[http://www.knoppneurosciences.com/index.php?section=news&subsection=news&id=56 FDA Fast Track KNS-760704 for ALS], September 2, 2009</ref> It has received [[Orphan Drug]] designation by both the FDA and the [[European Medicines Agency]]. Dexpramipexole is a low molecular weight, water-soluble, orally bioavailable, renally excreted compound with linear [[pharmacokinetics]], and has been shown to be well tolerated in human subject testing.<ref>Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of KNS-760704 (Dexpramipexole) in Healthy Adult Subjects.

KNS-760704 is the [[enantiomer]] of [[pramipexole]], and has been shown to improve mitochondrial function and to confer significant cellular protection in neurons under stress.<ref>KNS-760704 [(6R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-N6-propyl-2, 6-benzothiazole-diamine dihydrochloride monohydrate] for the Treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

CNS Neuroscience & Therapeutics 14 (2008) 215–226.</ref> KNS-760704 was originally identified as a candidate therapy for ALS by James Bennett, M.D., Ph.D., then of the [[University of Virginia]].

A 2010 Phase II clinical trial involving 102 patients showed a slowing of ALS disease progression.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = Richard | title = New Als Drug Shows Dose-Dependent Efficacy in Phase 2 Trial | url = http://journals.lww.com/neurotodayonline/Fulltext/2010/07010/New_Als_Drug_Shows_Dose_Dependent_Efficacy_in.2.aspx | journal = Neurology Today | volume = 10 | pages = 1 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1097/01.NT.0000384108.10957.21 | issue = 13}}</ref>

In January 2013, Biogen Idec announced that it was discontinuing its development of dexpramipexole in ALS due to lack of efficacy in a Phase III study.<ref name="PhaseIIIPR"/>
