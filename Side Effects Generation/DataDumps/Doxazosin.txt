'''Doxazosin mesylate''', a [[quinazoline]] compound sold by [[Pfizer]] under the brand names '''Cardura''' and '''Carduran''', is an [[Alpha-1 blocker|α<sub>1</sub>-selective alpha blocker]] used to treat [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]] and urinary retention associated with [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] (BPH).

On February 22, 2005, the [[United States|US]] [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approved an extended release form of doxazosin, to be marketed as '''Cardura XL'''.

It is an α<sub>1</sub> adrenergic receptor blocker that inhibits the binding of [[norepinephrine]] (released from [[sympathetic nerve]] terminals) to the α<sub>1</sub> receptors on the membrane of vascular [[smooth muscle]] cells. The primary effect of this inhibition is relaxed vascular [[smooth muscle]] tone ([[vasodilation]]), which decreases [[peripheral vascular resistance]], leading to decreased [[blood pressure]].

Doxazosin and similar medications like [[prazosin]] have been found to help reduce the intensity of and/or stop [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] [[night terror]]s and [[nightmare]]s. The full explanation for this effect is not understood.

In Egypt, tablet formulation sold as '''Duracin''' produced by Biopharm group for research and the drug industry, '''Dosin''' by Eipico and '''Doxazocine''' by Multi-Apex.

== Efficacy ==
In March 2000, the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) study stopped its arm of the trial looking at alpha blockers, because doxazosin was less effective than a simple [[diuretic]], and because patients on doxazosin had a 25% higher rate of [[cardiovascular disease]] and twice the rate of [[Heart failure|congestive heart failure]] as patients on diuretics.<ref name="Piller2002">{{cite journal |vauthors=Piller LB, Davis BR, Cutler JA |title=Validation of Heart Failure Events in the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) Participants Assigned to Doxazosin and Chlorthalidone |journal=Curr Control Trials Cardiovasc Med |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=10 |year=2002|pmid=12459039 |doi=10.1186/1468-6708-3-10|pmc=149403|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Pfizer, aware of the results before publication, launched a marketing campaign in early 2000, and sales were largely unaffected, despite the dangers highlighted by the study.<ref>Goldacre, Ben (2012) ''Bad Pharma How drug companies mislead doctors and harm patients'', Fourth Estate, {{ISBN|0007350740}}.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmc=1128917 |title=Spin doctors soft pedal data on antihypertensives|year=2003 |last1=Lenzer |first1=J |volume=326 |issue=7381 |pages=170 |journal=BMJ: British Medical Journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7381.170}}</ref>
