'''Acemannan''' is a D-isomer [[mucopolysaccharide]] in [[aloe vera]] leaves. This compound has been known to have [[immunostimulant]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CMJKgfhCKzIC&pg=PA152&lpg=PA152&dq=Acemannan+Immunostimulant+mucopolysaccharide#PPA152,M1|title=Pharmacodynamic Basis of Herbal Medicine|edition= Second |accessdate=23 May 2015|isbn=978-1-4200-0645-2|author1=Ebadi|first1=Manuchair|date=2006-09-06}}</ref> [[Antiviral drug|antiviral]], [[antineoplastic]] and [[gastrointestinal]] properties.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?sid=596005&loc=es_rss|title=SID 596005 – PubChem|author=Pubchem|work=nih.gov|accessdate=23 May 2015}}</ref>

== Chemical structure and properties ==
Acemannan's [[monomer]] is mannoacetate linked by β-1,4-[[glycosidic bond]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chemdb.niaid.nih.gov/struct_search/class/class_many.asp?class%3DGLYCOSYLATION+INHIBITORS |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090927064827/http://chemdb.niaid.nih.gov/struct_search/class/class_many.asp?class=GLYCOSYLATION%20INHIBITORS |archivedate=2009-09-27 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/vet/acemannan-immunostimulant.html|title=Acemannan Immunostimulant|work=drugs.com|accessdate=23 May 2015}}</ref> This polymer is [[hydrophilic]]: It has 50 [[hydrogen bond]] acceptors, 19 hydrogen bond donors, and a [[partition coefficient]] of -3.27.

== Immunostimulant properties ==
Acemannan has been demonstrated to induce [[macrophage]]s to secrete [[interferon]] (IFN), tumor necrosis factor-α ([[TNF-α]]) and [[interleukins]] (IL-1); therefore, it might help to prevent or abrogate [[viral infection]]. These three [[cytokines]] are known to cause inflammation, and interferon is released in response to viral infections. [[In vitro]] studies have shown acemannan to inhibit [[HIV]] replication; however, [[in vivo]] studies have been inconclusive.

Acemannan is currently being used for treatment and clinical management of [[fibrosarcoma]] in dogs and cats. Administration of acemannan has been shown to increase [[tumor]] [[necrosis]] and prolonged host survival; the animals have demonstrated [[lymphoid]] infiltration and encapsulation.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=1768373|pages=207–13|year=1991|author1=Harris|first1=C|title=Efficacy of acemannan in treatment of canine and feline spontaneous neoplasms|journal=Molecular biotherapy|volume=3|issue=4|last2=Pierce|first2=K|last3=King|first3=G|last4=Yates|first4=K.
