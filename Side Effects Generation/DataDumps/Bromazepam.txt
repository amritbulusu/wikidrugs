On occasion, benzodiazepines can induce extreme alterations in memory such as [[anterograde amnesia]] and [[amnesic automatism]], which may have medico-legal consequences.

Up to 30% treated on a long-term basis develop a form of dependence, i.e. these patients cannot stop the medication without experiencing physical and/or psychological [[benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms]].

[[Leukopenia]] and liver-damage of the cholostatic type with or without jaundice (icterus) have additionally been seen; the original manufacturer [[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche]] recommends regular laboratory examinations to be performed routinely.

Ambulatory patients should be warned that bromazepam may impair the ability to drive vehicles and to operate machinery. The impairment is worsened by consumption of alcohol, because both act as central nervous system depressants. During the course of therapy, tolerance to the sedative effect usually develops.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Bromazepam is reported to be metabolized by a hepatic enzyme belonging to the [[Cytochrome P450]] family of enzymes. In 2003, a team led by Dr. Oda Manami at Oita Medical University reported that [[CYP3A4]], a member of the Cytochrome P450 family, was not the responsible enzyme since [[itraconazole]], a known inhibitor of CYP3A4, did not affect its metabolism.<ref name="itraconazole">{{cite journal | last1 = Oda | first1 = M | last2 = Kotegawa | first2 = T | last3 = Tsutsumi | first3 = K | last4 = Ohtani | first4 = Y | last5 = Kuwatani | first5 = K | last6 = Nakano | first6 = S | date = Nov 2003 | title = The effect of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of bromazepam in healthy volunteers | url = http://www.oita-u.ac.jp/gakui/ik-307.pdf | journal = European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 59 | issue = 8-9 | pages = 615–9 | doi = 10.1007/s00228-003-0681-4 | pmid = 14517708 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050820030413/http://www.oita-u.ac.jp/gakui/ik-307.pdf | archivedate = 2005-08-20 | df =  }}</ref> In 1995, J. van Harten at [[Solvay Pharmaceuticals B.V.|Solvay Duphar B.V.]]'s Department of Clinical Pharmacology in [[Weesp]] reported that [[fluvoxamine]], which is a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, a less potent [[CYP3A4]] inhibitor, and a negligible inhibitor of [[CYP2D6]], does inhibit its metabolism.<ref name="pmid8846617" />

The active metabolite of bromazepam is hydroxybromazepam, which has a half-life approximately equal to that of bromazepam.{{citation needed|reason=Bromazepam is reported to be metabolized by a hepatic enzyme belonging to the Cytochrome P450 family of enzymes.
