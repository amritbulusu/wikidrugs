'''Phenazepam''' (also known in [[Russia]] as '''bromdihydrochlorphenylbenzodiazepine''') is a [[benzodiazepine]] drug, which was developed in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1975<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int|title=World Health Organization|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-20}}</ref>, and now produced in Russia and some [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries. Phenazepam is used in the treatment of various [[Mental disorder|psychiatric]] and [[neurological disorder]]s. It can be used as a premedication before surgery as it augments the effects of anesthetics and reduces anxiety. Recently, phenazepam has gained popularity as a [[recreational drug]]; misuse has been reported in the United Kingdom,<ref name=UK>{{Cite journal | last1 = Corkery | first1 = J.

==Indications==
* [[Neurosis]], neurosis-like, [[Psychopathy|psychopathic]], psychopathic-like and other conditions accompanied by fear, anxiety, increased irritability, and emotional lability
* [[Brief reactive psychosis]] and [[hypochondriasis]]
* [[Psychomotor agitation]]
* [[Vegetative-vascular dystonia]]
* [[Insomnia]]
* [[Alcohol withdrawal syndrome]]
* [[Temporal lobe epilepsy]] and [[myoclonic epilepsy]] (used only occasionally as better options exist)
* [[Hyperkinesia]] and [[tic]]s
* Muscle [[Hypertonia|spasticity]]<ref name = "PI">{{cite web|title=Phenazepam (bromdihydrochlorphenylbenzodiazepine) Tablets.

Usually, a course of treatment with phenazepam should not normally exceed 2 weeks (in some cases therapy may be prolonged for up to 2 months) due to the risk of drug [[Benzodiazepine misuse|abuse]] and [[Benzodiazepine dependence|dependence]]. To prevent [[Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome|withdrawal syndrome]], it is necessary to reduce the dose gradually.<ref name = "PI" />

==Side effects==
Side effects include [[hiccups]], [[dizziness]], [[ataxia|loss of coordination]] and [[sedation|drowsiness]], along with [[anterograde amnesia]] which can be quite pronounced at high doses.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stephenson|first=Jon|author2=David Golz |author3=Mary Jo Brasher |title=Phenazepam and its effects on driving|journal=Journal of Analytical Toxicology|date=January 2013|volume=37|issue=1|pages=25–29|url=http://jat.oxfordjournals.org/content/37/1/25.abstract|accessdate=31 January 2013|doi=10.1093/jat/bks080}}</ref> As with other benzodiazepines, in case of abrupt discontinuation following prolonged use, severe withdrawal symptoms may occur including [[Anxiety|restlessness]], [[anxiety]], [[insomnia]], [[seizure]]s, [[convulsion]]s and [[death]], though because of its long half-life, these withdrawal symptoms may take two or more days to manifest.

==Contraindications and special caution==
Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with [[comorbid]] [[psychiatric disorders]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Authier | first1 = N. | last2 = Balayssac | first2 = D. | last3 = Sautereau | first3 = M. | last4 = Zangarelli | first4 = A. | last5 = Courty | first5 = P. | last6 = Somogyi | first6 = A.

Phenazepam should not be taken with alcohol or any other CNS depressants. Phenazepam should not be used therapeutically for periods of longer than one month including tapering on and off the drug as recommended for any benzodiazepine in the British national formulary. Some patients may require longer term treatment.

Phenazepam was found to be a component in some herbal incense mixtures in Australia & New Zealand in 2011, namely "Kronic". The particular product variety was withdrawn shortly from the market after and replaced with a new formulation.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Couch | first1 = R. A.

==Detection in biological fluids==
Phenazepam may be measured in blood or plasma by chromatographic methods. Blood phenazepam concentrations are typically less than 30 μg/L during therapeutic usage, but have frequently been in the 100–600 μg/L range in automotive vehicle operators arrested for impaired driving ability.<ref>[http://www.biomedicalpublications.com/phenazepam.pdf R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 9th edition, Biomedical Publications, Seal Beach, CA, 2011, pp. 1320-1321.]</ref>

==Legal status==

===China===
As of October 2015, phenazepam is a controlled substance in China.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sfda.gov.cn/WS01/CL0056/130753.html | title=关于印发《非药用类麻醉药品和精神药品列管办法》的通知 | publisher=China Food and Drug Administration | date=27 September 2015 | language=Chinese | accessdate=1 October 2015}}</ref>

===United States===
Under federal United States law, phenazepam is not currently classified as a controlled substance, as the [[Federal Analog Act]] only provides for automatic assumed classification of chemicals "substantially similar" to existing Schedule I or Schedule II drugs, whereas all controlled benzodiazepines under the [[Controlled Substances Act]] are classified as Schedule IV. Although phenazepam is currently not controlled, sale for human use remains illegal in the United States.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/CriminalInvestigations/ucm323965.htm | date = October 10, 2012 | title = New York Nurse Sentenced for Selling Unapproved "Party Drug" Phenazepam on the Internet | quote = sale for human consumption is prohibited in the United States except for research under strictly regulated terms | publisher = U.S. Department of Justice}}</ref> Suppliers attempt to circumvent this regulation by placing a "Not for human use" disclaimer on the product's label.

Individual states in the United States often ban these analog drugs by name as they appear. Since 2012, [[Louisiana]] has classified phenazepam as a controlled dangerous substance.<ref name="Louisiana Phenazepam Ban">{{cite web | url = http://www.ksla.com/story/18578228/bill-to-ban-zannie-passes | title = Bill to Ban Zannie Passes | accessdate = 2012-05-21 | date = 2012-05-21 | publisher = KSLA 12}}</ref> This ban affects several products, some of which were sold at retail stores under the guise of air freshener or similar, containing phenazepam yet claiming not to be for human use. This legislation was introduced after one such product, branded as "Zannie" and marketed as an air freshener rapidly gained publicity as the subject of numerous media reports, attracting the attention of officials.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The ensuing investigation effort, led by Senator Fred Mills and Louisiana Poison Center Director Mark Ryan, positively identified the active ingredient of "Zannie" as phenazepam. According to Ryan, [[chemical analysis]] identified the active ingredient as "100 percent phenazepam".<ref name="Louisiana Phenazepam Ban"/>

Paul Halverson, director and state health officer for the Arkansas Department of Health, approved an emergency rule to ban the sale and distribution of phenazepam shortly after the Louisiana ban.  The actions in Louisiana and Arkansas add this drug as a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule I controlled substances|Schedule I Controlled Substance]], meaning it has no approved medical use in the United States and has a high potential for abuse.

===Elsewhere===
Phenazepam was classified as a narcotic in Finland in July, 2014.<ref name="finlandscheduling">{{cite web | url = http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2014/20140589 |title=Valtioneuvoston asetus huumausaineina pidettävistä aineista, valmisteista ja kasveista annetun valtioneuvoston asetuksen liitteen IV muuttamisesta
}}</ref>

Phenazepam is considered a narcotic in Norway, as per a March 23, 2010 Health Department addition to the Regular Narcotic List.

In Russia, while the drug is considered a prescription medication (but not a controlled one, as all other benzodiazepines except [[tofisopam]]), some pharmacies sell it without prescriptions required.

In Estonia, phenazepam is a Schedule IV substance under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Schedule IV is the lowest classification of psychoactive substances in Estonia. It includes prescribable drugs, including other benzodiazepines.

===UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs===
On 8 March 2016 at its 59th Session, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) added Phenazepam to relevant schedules of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961.<ref>[https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/press/releases/2016/March/seven-substances-scheduled-at-the-59th-session-of-the-commission-on-narcotic-drugs.html]</ref>
