==Pronunciation==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2017}}
In English, the word ''amen'' has two primary pronunciations, ''ah-men'' ({{IPA|/ɑːˈmɛn/}}) or ''ay-men'' ({{IPA|/eɪˈmɛn/}}),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/amen|title=amen - definition of amen in English from the Oxford dictionary|work=oxforddictionaries.com|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref> with minor additional variation in emphasis (the two syllables may be equally stressed instead of placing primary stress on the second).

In anglophone North America the ''ah-men'' pronunciation is used in performances of [[European classical music|classical music]], in churches with more formalized [[ritual]]s and [[liturgy]] and in liberal to mainline Protestant denominations, as well as almost every Jewish congregation, in line with modern Hebrew pronunciation. The ''ay-men'' pronunciation, a product of the [[Great Vowel Shift]] dating to the 15th century, is associated with Irish Protestantism and conservative [[evangelical Christianity|Evangelical]] denominations generally, and is the pronunciation typically used in [[gospel music]].

In [[Arabic]] the pronunciation ''ah-meen'' (ʾĀmīn) is used upon completing a [[Dua|supplication to God]] or when concluding recitation of the first surah [[Al Fatiha]] in [[Salat|prayer]].

Although in English transliteration they look different, they are both from the root aleph-mem-nun. That is, the Hebrew word ''amen'' derives from the same ancient [[triliteral]] Hebrew root as does the verb ''ʾāmán''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacrednamebible.com/kjvstrongs/STRHEB5.htm#S543 |title=King James Bible Strong's Hebrew Dictionary |accessdate=2008-02-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080213000626/http://www.sacrednamebible.com/kjvstrongs/STRHEB5.htm| archivedate= 13 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Grammarians frequently list ''ʾāmán'' under its three consonants ('''[[aleph]]-[[mem]]-[[Nun (letter)|nun]]'''), which are identical to those of ''ʾāmēn'' (note that the Hebrew letter א ''[[aleph]]'' represents a [[glottal stop]] sound, which functions as a consonant in the morphology of Hebrew).<ref name="AHD"/> This [[triliteral]] root means ''to be firm, confirmed, reliable, faithful, have faith, believe.''

In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the word is derived from its [[triliteral]] common root word ʾĀmana ({{lang-ar| آمن}}), which has the same meanings as the Hebrew root word.

===Hebrew Bible===
The word first occurs in the [[Hebrew Bible]] in Numbers 5:22 when the Priest addresses a suspected adulteress and she responds “Amen, Amen”. Overall, the word appears in the Hebrew Bible 30 times.

Three distinct Biblical usages of ''amen'' may be noted:<ref name="ce"/>
# Initial ''amen'', referring back to words of another speaker and introducing an affirmative sentence, e.g. 1 [[Books of Kings|Kings]] 1:36.<ref name="ce"/>
# Detached ''amen'', again referring to the words of another speaker but without a complementary affirmative sentence, e.g. Nehemiah 5:13.<ref name="ce"/>
# Final ''amen'', with no change of speaker, as in the subscription to the first three divisions of [[Psalms]].<ref name="ce"/>

=== New Testament ===
There are 52 amens in the [[Synoptic Gospels]] and 25 in [[Gospel of John|John]]. The five final amens (Matthew 6:13, 28:20, Mark 16:20, Luke 24:53 and John 21:25), which are wanting in certain [[Biblical manuscripts|manuscripts]], simulate the effect of final amen in the Hebrew [[Psalms]]. All initial amens occur in the sayings of Jesus. These initial amens are unparalleled in Hebrew literature, according to [[Friedrich Delitzsch]], because they do not refer to the words of a previous speaker but instead introduce a new thought.<ref>"Amen", ''[[Encyclopedia Biblica]]''</ref>

The uses of ''amen'' ("verily" or "I tell you the truth", depending on the translation) in the [[Gospels]] form a peculiar class; they are initial, but often lack any backward reference.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1383&letter=A&search=Amen|publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia|title=Amen|accessdate=2008-02-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080216101007/http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1383&letter=A&search=Amen| archivedate= 16 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> [[Jesus]] used the word to affirm his own utterances, not those of another person{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}, and this usage was adopted by the church. The use of the initial amen, single or double in form, to introduce solemn statements of Jesus in the Gospels had no parallel in Jewish practice.<ref name="Amen">{{cite encyclopedia| title = Amen | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica. | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica Online. | year = 2008 | url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9006072/amen | accessdate = 2008-03-17 }}</ref>

In the [[King James Version of the Bible|King James Bible]], the word ''amen'' is preserved in a number of contexts. Notable ones include:

* The [[catechism]] of curses of the [[Torah|Law]] found in [[Deuteronomy]] 27.<ref name="ce"/>
* A double ''amen'' ("amen and amen") occurs in [[Psalm]] 89 (Psalm 41:13; 72:19; 89:52), to confirm the words and invoke the fulfillment of them.<ref name="eastonsbibledictionary.com"/>
* ''Amen'' occurs in several [[doxology]] formulas in [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 1:25, 9:5, 11:36, 15:33, and several times in Chapter 16.<ref name="ce"/> It also appears in doxologies in the Psalms (41:14; 72:19; 89:53; 106:48). This liturgical form from [[Judaism]].<ref>cf. John L. McKenzie, SJ, "Dictionary of the Bible", New York: MacMillan Publ. Co., Inc., 1965. Entry: "Amen," p. 25)</ref>
* It concludes all of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul's]] general [[epistle]]s.
* In [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 3:14, Jesus is referred to as, "the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of God's creation."  The whole passage reads as "And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;".
* ''Amen'' concludes the [[New Testament]] at Rev. 22:21.

==Religious use==
=== Judaism ===
{{See also|Berakhah#Reciting amen|l1=Reciting amen}}

Although amen, in Judaism, is commonly stated as a response to a blessing, it is also often used as an affirmation of any declaration.

Jewish rabbinical [[halakha|law]] requires an individual to say ''amen'' in a variety of contexts.<ref>[[Orach Chaim]] 56 (amen in [[kaddish]]); [[Orach Chaim|O.C.]] 124 (amen in response to [[brachah|blessing]]s recited by the [[Hazzan|prayer reader]]); [[Orach Chaim|O.C.]] 215 (amen in response to [[brachah|blessing]]s made by any individual outside of the liturgy).</ref>

With the rise of the synagogue during the [[Second Temple]] period, ''amen'' became a common response, especially to benedictions. It is recited communally to affirm a [[brachah|blessing]] made by the [[Hazzan|prayer reader]]. It is also mandated as a response during the [[kaddish]] doxology.
The congregation is sometimes prompted to answer 'amen' by the terms ''ve-'imru'' ({{lang-he|ואמרו}}) = "and [now] say (pl.)," or, ''ve-nomar'' (ונאמר) = "and let us say." Contemporary usage reflects ancient practice: As early as the 4th century BCE, Jews assembled in the [[second temple|Temple]] responded 'amen' at the close of a doxology or other prayer uttered by a [[kohen|priest]]. This Jewish [[liturgical]] use of amen was adopted by the Christians.<ref name="Amen"/> But [[halakha|Jewish law]] also requires individuals to answer ''amen'' whenever they hear a [[brachah|blessing]] recited, even in a non-liturgical setting.

The [[Talmud]] teaches [[Homiletics|homiletically]] that the word ''amen'' is an [[acronym]] for '''א'''ל '''מ'''לך '''נ'''אמן (''ʾEl melekh neʾeman'', "God, trustworthy King"),<ref name="Tractate Shabbat 119b">[[Shabbat (Talmud)|Tractate Shabbat]] 119b and [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Tractate Sanhedrin]] 111a</ref> the phrase recited silently by an individual before reciting the [[Shma]].

Jews usually approximate the Hebrew pronunciation of the word: {{IPAc-en|ɑː|ˈ|m|ɛ|n}} {{respell|ah|MEN|'}} (Israeli-[[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazi]] and [[Sephardi Hebrew language|Sephardi]]) or {{IPAc-en|ɔː|ˈ|m|eɪ|n}} {{respell|aw|MAYN|'}} (non-Israeli Ashkenazi).<ref>''To Pray as a Jew: A Guide to the Prayer Book and the Synagogue Service,'' Hayim Halevy Donin</ref>

=== Christianity ===
The use of "amen" has been generally adopted in Christian worship as a concluding word for prayers and hymns and an expression of strong agreement.<ref name="Amen"/>  The liturgical use of the word in apostolic times is attested by the passage from 1 Corinthians cited above, and [[Justin Martyr]] (c. 150) describes the congregation as responding "amen" to the benediction after the celebration of the Eucharist.<ref name="ce"/>  Its introduction into the baptismal formula (in the Eastern Orthodox Church it is pronounced after the name of each person of the Trinity) was probably later.<ref>Among certain [[gnosticism|Gnostic]] sects, ''Amen'' became the name of an angel.</ref>

In [[Isaiah]] 65:16, the authorized version has "the God of truth" ("the God of amen" in [[Hebrew]]). Jesus often used amen to put emphasis to his own words (translated: "verily"). In John's Gospel, it is repeated, "Verily, verily". Amen is also used in oaths (Numbers 5:22; Deuteronomy 27:15–26; Nehemiah 5:13; 8:6; 1 Chronicles 16:36) and is further found at the end of the prayer of primitive churches (1 Corinthians 14:16).<ref name="eastonsbibledictionary.com">{{cite web|url=http://eastonsbibledictionary.com/a/amen.htm|title=Bible Dictionary: Amen|work=eastonsbibledictionary.com|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref>

<!--:''(from an old encyclopedia)''-->
In some Christian [[Church (building)|churches]], the "amen corner" or "amen section" is any subset of the congregation likely to call out "Amen!" in response to points in a preacher's [[sermon]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hovda|first1=Robert W.|title=The amen corner|journal=Worship|date=1983|volume=57|issue=2|pages=150–156|accessdate=15 December 2016}}</ref> Metaphorically, the term can refer to any group of heartfelt traditionalists or supporters of an authority figure.

''Amen'' is also used in standard, international French, but in [[Cajun French]] ''Ainsi soit-il'' ("so be it") is used instead.

Amen is used at the end of the [[Lord's Prayer]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Matthew 6:9–15|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206:9-15&version=WYC|work=Wycliffe Bible|author=Wycliffe}}</ref> which is also called the Our Father or the ''Pater Noster''.

=== {{anchor|Amen in Islam}}Islam ===
[[File:Ameen.gif|thumb|ʾĀmīn in [[Arabic]].]]
''ʾĀmīn'' ({{lang-ar|آمين}}) is the Arabic form of ''Amen''. In Islam, it is used with the same meaning as in Judaism and Christianity; when concluding a prayer, especially after a [[supplication]] ([[du'a]]) or reciting the first surah [[Al Fatiha]] of the [[Qur'an]] ([[salat]]), and as an assent to the prayers of others.<ref>{{cite book | last = Hastings | first = James | authorlink=James Hastings| title = A Dictionary of Christ and the Gospels: Volume I | publisher = The Minerva Group, Inc.| origyear=1901| year = 2004 | page = 52}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Glassé | first = Cyril | title = The New Encyclopedia of Islam | publisher = Stacey International | year = 2003| page = 48 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=focLrox-frUC&pg=PA48
