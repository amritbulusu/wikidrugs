'''Aclidinium bromide''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) is a long-acting, inhaled [[muscarinic antagonist]] (LAMA) approved in the US on July 24, 2012<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://news.frx.com/press-release/corporate-news/forest-laboratories-and-almirall-announce-fda-approval-tudorza-pressair |title=Forest Laboratories and Almirall Announce FDA Approval of Tudorza Pressair for the Long-Term Maintenance Treatment of COPD  |publisher=Forest Laboratories |accessdate=2012-07-24}}</ref> as a maintenance treatment for [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD).<ref name="Gavalda2009">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gavaldà A, Miralpeix M, Ramos I |title=Characterization of aclidinium bromide, a novel inhaled muscarinic antagonist, with long duration of action and a favorable pharmacological profile |journal=J Pharmacol Exp Ther. |year=2009 |volume=331 |issue=2 |pages=740–51 |doi=10.1124/jpet.109.151639 |pmid=19710368 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>

Evidence shows that it can improve [[quality of life]] and prevent hospitalization in those with COPD.<ref name=Cochrane2014/> However, it does not appear to affect the risk of death or the frequency steroids are needed.<ref name=Cochrane2014/> It is unclear if it differs from the similar medication [[tiotropium]] or other commonly used medications from the class of LAMAs.<ref name=Cochrane2014>{{cite journal|last1=Ni|first1=H|last2=Soe|first2=Z|last3=Moe|first3=S|title=Aclidinium bromide for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|year=2014|issue=9|pages=CD010509|pmid=25234126|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010509.pub2}}</ref>

Aclidinium is delivered via a multidose [[dry powder inhaler]], the Genuair inhaler.

==Adverse effects==
The substance is generally well tolerated. Common side effects (in more than 1% of patients) are [[sinusitis]], [[nasopharyngitis]], headache, cough, [[diarrhoea]] and nausea. The latter is less common under the drug than under [[placebo]]. Skin reactions such as [[rash]], as well as side effects that are typical of muscarinic antagonists ([[tachycardia|fast heart rate]], [[palpitations]], and [[urinary retention]]), occur in less than 1% of patients.<ref name="AC">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2015|language=German}}</ref><ref name="Drugs.com">{{drugs.com|pro|tudorza-pressair}} on Tudorza Pressair.</ref>

A small increase of [[cardiovascular risk]] cannot be excluded from available data. Patients with relevant cardiovascular diseases were excluded from studies.<ref name="Dinnendahl" />

==Interactions==
No systematic interaction studies have been performed. It is expected that adverse effects of aclidinium increase if it is combined with other muscarinic antagonists. In clinical practice, no interactions with other COPD medications such as [[glucocorticoid]]s, [[β2-adrenergic agonist|β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonist]]s and [[theophylline]] have been described. As aclidinium does not relevantly interact with [[cytochrome P450]] liver enzymes or [[P-glycoprotein]], and is quickly [[metabolized]] as soon as it reaches the bloodstream, it is considered to have a very low potential for interactions.<ref name="AC" /><ref name="Dinnendahl" />

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
{{further information|Muscarinic antagonist}}
Aclidinium is a long-acting, [[reversible antagonist]] at [[muscarinic receptor]]s, with similar affinity to all five subtypes, but with a [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] half-life from subtype [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3|M<sub>3</sub>]] of 29.2 hours, or six times longer than that from [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2|M<sub>2</sub>]]. For comparison, M<sub>3</sub> dissociation half-lives of the related drugs [[ipratropium]] and [[tiotropium]] are 0.47 hours and 62.2 hours, respectively.<ref name="Dinnendahl" />

Its action at subtype M<sub>3</sub> at the [[smooth muscle]] of the [[bronchiole]]s is responsible for its desired effect: it reduces contraction of these muscles and improves the airflow.<ref name="AC" /><ref name="Drugs.com" /> M<sub>2</sub> affinity is the main reason for adverse effects at the heart.<ref name="Dinnendahl" />

===Pharmacokinetics===
About 30% of inhaled aclidinium are deposited in the lung.<ref name="Dinnendahl" /> Its action there lasts for more than 24 hours.<ref name="Drugs.com" /> From the lung, it is absorbed into the bloodstream, reaching highest [[blood plasma]] concentrations after five minutes in healthy persons and after 10 to 15 minutes in COPD patients. The substance is quickly [[hydrolysed]] to the [[carboxylic acid]] and the alcohol, so that less than 5% of the inhaled dose are found unchanged in the plasma. Hydrolysis is both non-enzymatic and enzymatic, the latter mainly by [[butyrylcholinesterase]].<ref name="AC" /><ref name="Dinnendahl">{{cite book|title=Arzneistoff-Profile|editor1=Dinnendahl, V |editor2=Fricke, U |publisher=Govi Pharmazeutischer Verlag|location=Eschborn, Germany|date=2014|edition=27|volume=1|isbn=978-3-7741-9846-3|language=German}}</ref>

The acid metabolite has a plasma protein binding of 87%, and the alcohol of 15%. These [[metabolites]] are found to 65% in the urine and to 33% in the faeces. Elimination half-life is two to three hours. Unchanged aclidinium accounts for only 0.1% of the excreted dose.<ref name="AC" />

==Chemistry==
Aclidinium is a [[quaternary ammonium cation]] with an [[asymmetric carbon]] atom. It is used as the pure ''R''-[[enantiomer]]. The salt, aclidinium bromide, is a crystalline powder that is hardly soluble in water or [[ethanol]].

==Society and culture==

===Brand names===
It is marketed under the brand name ''Tudorza Pressair'' in the US, ''Eklira Genuair'' in the UK, and ''Tudorza Genuair'' in Canada; licensed to Menarini under the brand name ''Bretaris Genuair'' for majority of EU member states.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.menarini.com/news/News-Archive/20122/26-03-2012-Almirall-and-Menarini-sign-a-licence-agreement-and-commercial-alliance-for-Aclidinium-in-the-majority-of-European-member-states-and-a-number-of-non-EU-countries |title=Almirall and Menarini sign a licence agreement and commercial alliance for Aclidinium in the majority of European member states and a number of non-EU countries |publisher=Menarini |accessdate=2012-03-26}}</ref>

An inhalable [[Aclidinium/formoterol|combination with formoterol]] is marketed as ''Brimica Genuair''<ref>{{Drugs.com|UK|brimica-genuair}} on Brimica Genuair.</ref> and ''Duaklir Genuair''<ref>{{Drugs.com|UK|duaklir-genuair}} on Duaklir Genuair.</ref> in Europe.
