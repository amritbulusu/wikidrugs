'''Dextromethorphan''' ('''DXM''' or '''DM''') is a [[drug]] of the [[morphinan]] class with [[sedative]], [[dissociative]], and [[stimulant]] properties (at higher doses). It is a [[cough suppressant]] in many [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] [[common cold|cold]] and [[cough]] medicines including [[generic drug|generic]] labels and [[store brand]]s, [[Benylin]] DM, Mucinex DM, Camydex-20 tablets, [[Robitussin]], [[NyQuil]], [[Dimetapp]], [[Vicks]], [[Coricidin]], [[Delsym]], [[TheraFlu]], Cheracol D, and others. Dextromethorphan has also found numerous other uses in medicine, ranging from [[pain relief]] (as either the primary [[analgesic]], or an opioid [[potentiator]]) over [[psychological]] applications to [[addiction medicine|the treatment of addiction]]. It is sold in [[syrup]], tablet, spray, and [[throat lozenge|lozenge]] forms. In its pure form, dextromethorphan occurs as a white powder.<ref name="urlReference Tables: Description and Solubility - D">{{cite web | url = http://www.pharmacopeia.cn/v29240/usp29nf24s0_alpha-2-13.html | title = Reference Tables: Description and Solubility - D | coauthors = | date = | work = | publisher = | pages = | accessdate = 2011-05-06}}</ref>

DXM is also used [[recreational use of dextromethorphan|recreationally]]. When exceeding approved dosages, dextromethorphan acts as a dissociative [[anesthetic]]. Its [[mechanism of action]] is via multiple effects, including actions as a nonselective [[serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]<ref name="Schwartz, Pizon, Brooks 2008">{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/15563650701668625 |pmid=19238739 |title=Dextromethorphan-induced serotonin syndrome |journal=Clinical Toxicology |volume=46 |issue=8 |pages=771–3 |year=2008 |last1=Schwartz |first1=Anna R. |last2=Pizon |first2=Anthony F. |last3=Brooks |first3=Daniel E. }}</ref> and a [[sigma-1 receptor|sigma-1]] [[Cell surface receptor|receptor]] agonist.<ref name="pmid17386960">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuint.2007.01.008 |pmid=17386960 |title=Dextromethorphan attenuates trimethyltin-induced neurotoxicity via σ1 receptor activation in rats |journal=Neurochemistry International |volume=50 |issue=6 |pages=791–9 |year=2007 |last1=Shin |first1=E |last2=Nah |first2=S |last3=Chae |first3=J |last4=Bing |first4=G |last5=Shin |first5=S |last6=Yen |first6=T |last7=Baek |first7=I |last8=Kim |first8=W |last9=Maurice |first9=T |last10=Nabeshima |first10=T |last11=Kim |first11=H.

==Medical uses==
[[File:Dextrometorfano.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|Generic dextromethorphan cough syrup.]]

===Cough suppression===
The primary use of dextromethorphan is as a [[cough suppressant]], for the temporary relief of cough caused by minor throat and bronchial irritation (such as commonly accompanies the [[influenza|flu]] and [[common cold]]), as well as those resulting from inhaled particle irritants.<ref name = AMH>{{cite book | title = Australian Medicines Handbook | year = 2013 | publisher = The Australian Medicines Handbook Unit Trust | isbn = 978-0-9805790-9-3 | place = Adelaide | editor = Rossi, S }}{{page needed|date=April 2015}}</ref> However, controlled studies have found the symptomatic effectiveness of dextromethorphan similar to placebo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/803288|title=Do Cough Remedies Work?|website=Medscape|access-date=10 April 2016|vauthors=Van Amburgh JA}}</ref>

===Neuropsychiatric disorders===
In 2010, the FDA approved the combination product [[dextromethorphan/quinidine]] for the treatment of [[pseudobulbar affect]] (emotional lability).<ref name="NguyenThomas2016">{{cite journal|last1=Nguyen|first1=Linda|last2=Thomas|first2=Kelan L.|last3=Lucke-Wold|first3=Brandon P.|last4=Cavendish|first4=John Z.|last5=Crowe|first5=Molly S.|last6=Matsumoto|first6=Rae R.|title=Dextromethorphan: An update on its utility for neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders|journal=Pharmacology & Therapeutics|volume=159|year=2016|pages=1–22|issn=0163-7258|doi=10.1016/j.pharmthera.2016.01.016|pmid=26826604}}</ref> Dextromethorphan is the actual therapeutic agent in the combination; [[quinidine]] merely serves to inhibit the [[enzymatic]] [[catabolism|degradation]] of dextromethorphan and thereby increase its circulating concentrations via inhibition of [[CYP2D6]].<ref name="NguyenThomas2016" />

==Contraindications==
Because dextromethorphan can trigger a [[histamine]] release ([[allergic reaction]]), [[atopic]] children, who are especially susceptible to allergic reactions, should be administered dextromethorphan only if absolutely necessary, and only under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional.<ref name="nhtsa" />

==Adverse effects==
Side effects of dextromethorphan at normal therapeutic doses can include:<ref name = MSR/><ref name = AMH/><ref name="nhtsa">{{cite web | url = http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/PEOPLE/injury/research/job185drugs/dextromethorphan.htm|title=Dextromethorphan | work = NHTSA}}</ref>

}}

A rare side effect is [[respiratory depression]].<ref name = AMH/>

===Neurotoxicity===
Dextromethorphan had been thought to cause [[Olney's lesions]] when administered [[intravenously]]; however, this was later proven inconclusive, due to lack of research on humans. Tests were performed on rats, giving them 50&nbsp;mg and up every day up to a month. Neurotoxic changes, including vacuolation, have been observed in posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortices of rats administered other NMDA antagonists such as PCP, but not with dextromethorphan.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.2660263 |pmid=2660263 |title=Pathological changes induced in cerebrocortical neurons by phencyclidine and related drugs |journal=Science |volume=244 |issue=4910 |pages=1360–2 |year=1989 |last1=Olney |first1=J. |last2=Labruyere |first2=J |last3=Price |first3=M. |bibcode=1989Sci...244.1360O }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuro.2007.03.009 |pmid=17573115 |title=Oral administration of dextromethorphan does not produce neuronal vacuolation in the rat brain |journal=NeuroToxicology |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=813–8 |year=2007 |last1=Carliss |first1=R.D. |last2=Radovsky |first2=A. |last3=Chengelis |first3=C.P. |last4=o’Neill |first4=T.P. |last5=Shuey |first5=D.L. }}</ref>

===Dependence and withdrawal===
In many documented cases, dextromethorphan has produced [[substance dependence|psychological dependence]] in people who used it recreationally. However, it does not produce [[substance dependence|physical addiction]], according to the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] Committee on Drug Dependence.<ref>{{cite book |title=WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence, Seventeenth Report | publisher = World Health Organization | year = 1970 | url = http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_437.pdf | format = PDF |accessdate = 2008-12-29 }}{{page needed|date=April 2015}}</ref> It is considered less addictive than the other common weak opiate cough suppressant, [[codeine]].<ref name = MSR/> Since dextromethorphan also acts as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) users describe that regular recreational use over a longer period of time can cause withdrawal symptoms that are similar to those of [[antidepressant discontinuation syndrome]]. Additionally, disturbances have been reported in: sleep, senses, movement, mood, and thinking.

==Overdose==
Adverse effects of dextromethorphan in [[overdose]] at doses 3 to 10&nbsp;times the recommended therapeutic dose:<ref name="webmd">{{cite web | url = http://www.webmd.com/parenting/teen-abuse-cough-medicine-9/teens-and-dxm-drug-abuse?page=3 | title = Teen Drug Abuse: Cough Medicine and DXM (Dextromethorphan) | publisher = webmd }}</ref>

}}

==Interactions==
Dextromethorphan should not be taken with [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAOIs)<ref name="nhtsa" /> due to the potential for [[serotonin syndrome]], which is a potentially life-threatening condition that can occur rapidly, due to a buildup of an excessive amount of serotonin in the body. Dextromethorphan can also cause serotonin syndrome when used with [[SSRI]] medicines, an interaction which has been documented in clinical cases where dextromethorphan is taken at [[recreational drug use|recreational doses]]. The link between therapeutic dosages of dextromethorphan and serotonin syndrome has been suggested to be less conclusive.<ref name="Schwartz, Pizon, Brooks 2008"/>

Caution should be exercised when taking dextromethorphan when drinking [[grapefruit]] juice or eating grapefruits, as [[Grapefruit drug interactions|compounds in grapefruit affect a number of drugs]], including dextromethorphan, through the inhibition of the cytochrome p450 system in the liver, and can lead to excessive accumulation and prolonged effects. Grapefruit and grapefruit juices (especially white grapefruit juice, but also including other citrus fruits such as [[Bergamot orange|bergamot]] and [[Lime (fruit)|lime]], as well as a number of noncitrus fruits<ref name="GANFYD.org">{{cite web | title = Inhibitors of CYP3A4 | url = http://www.ganfyd.org/index.php?title=Inhibitors_of_CYP3A4 | publisher = ganfyd.org | accessdate = 23 August 2013}}</ref>) generally are recommended to be avoided while using dextromethorphan and numerous other medications.

Rather than acting as a direct NMDA receptor antagonist itself, dextromethorphan acts as a [[prodrug]] of its much more potent metabolite [[dextrorphan]], and this is the actual mediator of its dissociative effects.<ref name="pmid10064839">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0006-8993(99)01125-7 |pmid=10064839 |title=Binding of dimemorfan to sigma-1 receptor and its anticonvulsant and locomotor effects in mice, compared with dextromethorphan and dextrorphan |journal=Brain Research |volume=821 |issue=2 |pages=516–9 |year=1999 |last1=Chou |first1=Yueh-Ching |last2=Liao |first2=Jyh-Fei |last3=Chang |first3=Wan-Ya |last4=Lin |first4=Ming-Fang |last5=Chen |first5=Chieh-Fu }}</ref> What role, if any, (+)-[[3-methoxymorphinan]], dextromethorphan's other major metabolite, plays in its effects is not entirely clear.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-081X(199704)18:3<227::AID-BDD18>3.0.CO;2-L |pmid=9113345 |title=Metabolism of Dextromethorphanin vitro: Involvement of Cytochromes P450 2D6 AND 3A3/4, with a Possible Role of 2E1 |journal=Biopharmaceutics & Drug Disposition |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=227–40 |year=1997 |last1=Schmider |first1=Jürgen |last2=Greenblatt |first2=David J. |last3=Fogelman |first3=Steven M. |last4=von Moltke |first4=Lisa L. |last5=Shader |first5=Richard I. }}</ref>

===Pharmacokinetics===
Following oral administration, dextromethorphan is rapidly absorbed from the [[gastrointestinal tract]], where it enters the [[bloodstream]] and crosses the [[blood–brain barrier]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

At therapeutic doses, dextromethorphan acts [[central nervous system|centrally]] (meaning that it acts on the [[brain]]) as opposed to locally (on the [[respiratory tract]]). It elevates the threshold for coughing, without inhibiting [[cilia]]ry activity. Dextromethorphan is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and converted into the active metabolite dextrorphan in the liver by the cytochrome P450 enzyme [[CYP2D6]]. The average dose necessary for effective antitussive therapy is between 10 and 45&nbsp;mg, depending on the individual. The International Society for the Study of Cough recommends "an adequate first dose of medication is 60 mg in the adult and repeat dosing should be infrequent rather than the [[List of medical abbreviations: Q|qds]] recommended."<ref name=MoriceCough>{{cite web | url = http://www.issc.info/cough.html | author = Morice AH | title = Cough | publisher = International Society for the Study of Cough }}</ref>

DXM has an [[elimination half-life]] of approximately 4&nbsp;hours in individuals with an extensive metabolizer phenotype; this is increased to approximately 13&nbsp;hours when DXM is given in combination with [[quinidine]].<ref name="pmid27139517" /> The [[duration of action]] after oral administration is about three to eight hours for dextromethorphan hydrobromide, and 10 to 12 hours for dextromethorphan polistirex. Around one in 10 of the Caucasian population has little or no CYP2D6 enzyme activity, leading to long-lived high drug levels.<ref name=MoriceCough/>

====Metabolism====
The first pass through the [[hepatic portal vein]] results in some of the drug being metabolized by O-demethylation into an active metabolite of dextromethorphan called dextrorphan (DXO). DXO is the 3-hydroxy derivative of dextromethorphan. The therapeutic activity of dextromethorphan is believed to be caused by both the drug and this metabolite. Dextromethorphan also undergoes N-demethylation (to 3-methoxymorphinan or MEM),<ref name="DXMdualprobe">{{cite journal |pmid=11602530 |url=http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11602530 |year=2001 |author1=Yu |first1=A |title=Comparative contribution to dextromethorphan metabolism by cytochrome P450 isoforms in vitro: Can dextromethorphan be used as a dual probe for both CTP2D6 and CYP3A activities? |journal=Drug Metabolism and Disposition |volume=29 |issue=11 |pages=1514–20 |last2=Haining |first2=R. L. }}</ref> and partial conjugation with glucuronic acid and sulfate ions. Hours after dextromethorphan therapy, (in humans) the metabolites (+)-3-hydroxy-N-methylmorphinan, (+)-3-morphinan, and traces of the unchanged drug are detectable in the urine.<ref name="nhtsa" />

A major metabolic catalyst involved is the cytochrome P450 enzyme known as 2D6, or CYP2D6. A significant portion of the population has a functional deficiency in this enzyme and are known as poor CYP2D6 metabolizers. O-demethylation of DXM to DXO contributes to at least 80% of the DXO formed during DXM metabolism.<ref name="DXMdualprobe"/> As CYP2D6 is a major [[metabolic pathway]] in the inactivation of dextromethorphan, the duration of action and effects of dextromethorphan can be increased by as much as three times in such poor metabolizers.<ref name="pmid8841152">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0009-9236(96)90056-9 |pmid=8841152 |title=The influence of CYP2D6 polymorphism and quinidine on the disposition and antitussive effect of dextromethorphan in humans |journal=Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=295–307 |year=1996 |last1=Capon |first1=Deborah A. |last2=Bochner |first2=Felix |last3=Kerry |first3=Nicole |last4=Mikus |first4=Gerd |last5=Danz |first5=Catherine |last6=Somogyi |first6=Andrew A. }}</ref> In one study on 252 Americans, 84.3% were found to be "fast" (extensive) metabolizers, 6.8% to be "intermediate" metabolizers, and 8.8% were "slow" metabolizers of DXM.<ref name="DXMpolymorphicmetabolism">{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/j.1552-4604.1987.tb02174.x |title=The Polymorphic Metabolism of Dextromethorphan |journal=The Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=139–43 |year=1987 |last1=Woodworth |first1=J.

The distribution of alleles is uneven amongst [[CYP2D6#Ethnic factors in variability|ethnic groups]].

A large number of medications are potent inhibitors of CYP2D6. Some types of medications known to inhibit CYP2D6 include certain SSRIs and [[tricyclic]] [[antidepressant]]s, some [[antipsychotics]], and the commonly available [[antihistamine]] [[diphenhydramine]]. Therefore, the potential of interactions exists between dextromethorphan and medications that inhibit this enzyme, particularly in slow metabolizers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} <!-- See also [[CYP2D6 inhibitors|CYP2D6 - Ligands]]. -->
DXM is also metabolized by [[CYP3A4]]. N-demethylation is primarily accomplished by CYP3A4, contributing to at least 90% of the MEM formed as a primary metabolite of DXM.<ref name="DXMdualprobe" />

A number of other CYP enzymes are implicated as minor pathways of DXM metabolism. CYP2B6 is actually more effective than CYP3A4 at N-demethylation of DXM, but, since the average individual has a much lower CYP2B6 content in his/her liver relative to CYP3A4, most N-demethylation of DXM is catalyzed by CYP3A4.<ref name="DXMdualprobe" />

==Chemistry==
Dextromethorphan is the [[dextrorotation|dextrorotatory]] [[enantiomer]] of [[levomethorphan]], which is the methyl [[ether]] of [[levorphanol]], both [[opioid]] [[analgesic]]s. It is named according to [[IUPAC]] rules as (+)-3-methoxy-17-methyl-9α,13α,14α-[[morphinan]]. As its pure form, dextromethorphan occurs as an odorless, opalescent white powder. It is freely soluble in [[chloroform]] and insoluble in [[water]]; the hydrobromide salt is water-soluble up to 1.5g/100 mL at 25&nbsp;°C.<ref>http://www.inchem.org/documents/pims/pharm/pim179.htm</ref> Dextromethorphan is commonly available as the monohydrated hydrobromide salt, however some newer extended-release formulations contain dextromethorphan bound to an [[ion-exchange resin]] based on [[Sodium polystyrene sulfonate|polystyrene sulfonic acid]]. Dextromethorphan's [[specific rotation]] in water is +27.6° (20&nbsp;°C, Sodium D-line).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Detection in body fluids===
Laboratory testing for DXM is done either by blood or by urine. Blood can be either serum or plasma. Urine requires 2&nbsp;mL minimum.

During the 1960s and 1970s, dextromethorphan became available in an over-the-counter tablet form by the brand name Romilar. In 1973, Romilar was taken off the shelves after a burst in sales because of frequent misuse, and was replaced by [[cough syrup]] in an attempt to cut down on abuse.<ref name="cesar"/> The advent of widespread internet access in the 1990s allowed users to rapidly disseminate information about DXM, and online discussion groups formed around use and acquisition of the drug.<ref name=Morris/> As early as 1996, DXM HBr powder could be purchased in bulk from online retailers, allowing users to avoid consuming DXM in syrup preparations.<ref name=Morris/> As of January 1, 2012, dextromethorphan is prohibited for sale to minors in the state of California, except with a doctor's prescription.<ref name="urlwww.leginfo.ca.gov">{{cite web | url = http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/sen/sb_0501-0550/sb_514_bill_20110831_chaptered.pdf | title = Senate Bill No. 514 | format = | work = An act to add Sections 11110 and 11111 to the Health and Safety Code, relating to nonprescription drugs. | publisher = State of California, Legislative Counsel }}</ref>
