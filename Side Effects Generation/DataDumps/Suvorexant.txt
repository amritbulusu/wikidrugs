==Medical uses==
Suvorexant is used for the treatment of [[insomnia]], characterized by difficulties with [[sleep onset]] and/or sleep maintenance.<ref name="prescribing info">{{cite web|url=http://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/b/belsomra/belsomra_pi.pdf |title=Highlights of prescribing information}}</ref>

==Side effects==
The most common complaint about the drug is from users who report that it did not help them to sleep.<ref name="Carr February 2016">{{Cite journal|last=Carr|first=Teresa|date=5 February 2016|title=FDA Fields Complaints on Sleeping Pill Suvorexant|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/drugs/fda-fields-complaints-on-sleeping-pill-suvorexant-belsomra/|journal=Consumer Reports|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> Some people reported that the drug caused a sleep disturbance such as a [[nightmare]], [[sleep terror]], or abnormal dream.<ref name="Carr February 2016"/><ref name="Jac2014" /> Others reported that the drug caused them to be more awake.<ref name="Carr February 2016"/>

There have been reports of people performing complex tasks (such as cooking and eating, making phone calls, driving, having sex) with little recollection of the events with the use of [[Hypnotic|hypnotics]] such as suvorexant.<ref>{{cite web|title=Belsomra|url=http://www.drugs.com/pro/belsomra.html|website=drugs.com|accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref>

===Contraindications===
This drug is not recommended in people with [[liver impairment]].<ref name="13a" /> Suvorexant [[pregnancy]] category is currently classified as Category C.<ref name="Bel" /> Based on animal testing, this medication may cause fetal harm during pregnancy and should only be given in pregnancy if the potential benefit justifies the potential harm to the fetus. Evidence is inconclusive about whether using this medication while [[breastfeeding]] puts the infant at risk of harm.<ref name="13a">Label: BELSOMRA- Suvorexant Tablet, Film Coated"Label: BELSOMRA- Suvorexant Tablet, Film Coated." DailyMed. Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. & the U.S. National Library of Medicine, 01 Aug. 2014. Web. 29 Oct. 2014.</ref>

Suvorexant is contraindicated in people diagnosed with [[narcolepsy]].<ref name="Bel">Product Information: BELSOMRA(R) oral tablets, suvorexant oral tablets. Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. (per manufacturer), Whitehouse Station, NJ, 2014.</ref>

==Interactions==
Suvorexant is not recommended if people are also taking medications that strongly inhibit the liver enzyme [[CYP3A]] like [[itraconazole]], [[lopinavir]]/[[ritonavir]], [[clarithromycin]], [[ritonavir]], [[ketoconazole]], [[indinavir]]/[[ritonavir]], or [[conivaptan]].<ref name=13a/><ref name=14a/> If suvorexant is used with a medication that moderately inhibits the liver enzyme CYP3A, like [[verapamil]], [[erythromycin]], [[diltiazem]], or [[dronedarone]], it is recommended that the dose of suvorexant be adjusted.<ref name=13a/><ref name=14a>"U.S. Food and Drug Administration." Drug Development and Drug Interactions: Table of Substrates, Inhibitors and Inducers. U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 27 Oct. 2014. Web. 30 Oct. 2014.</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Suvorexant exerts its therapeutic effect in [[insomnia]] through [[receptor antagonist|antagonism]] of [[orexin receptor]]s. The [[orexin]] [[neuropeptide]] signaling system is a [[central nervous system|central]] promoter of [[wakefulness]]. Blocking the binding of wake-promoting neuropeptides [[orexin A]] and [[orexin B]] to receptors [[orexin receptor type 1]] (OX<sub>1</sub>) and [[orexin receptor type 2]] (OX<sub>2</sub>) is thought to suppress wake drive.<ref name="prescribing info"/> Animal studies report the [[affinity (pharmacology)|binding affinities]] for OX<sub>1</sub> (0.55 nM) and OX<sub>2</sub> (0.35 nM).<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.fda.gov/downloads/advisorycommittees/committeesmeetingmaterials/drugs/peripheralandcentralnervoussystemdrugsadvisorycommittee/ucm352970.pdf|title = Suvorexant Advisory Committee Meeting Briefing Document|date = May 22, 2013|accessdate = Feb 7, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>

==Pharmacokinetics==
The [[bioavailability]] of suvorexant is at 82%. It is highly [[protein-bound]]. Food delays the time to max concentration. The primary route of elimination is through the feces, with approximately 66% of radiolabeled dose recovered in the feces compared to 23% in the urine. The elimination [[half-life]] is reported to be 12 hours.<ref name=Bel/>

==Abuse liability==
According to the U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), suvorexant produces similar [[reinforcement|reinforcing effect]]s to those of [[zolpidem]] in humans and thus may have a similar [[abuse liability]].<ref name="pmid25167596">{{cite journal | vauthors = | title = Schedules of controlled substances: placement of suvorexant into Schedule IV.
