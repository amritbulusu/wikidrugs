'''Saracatinib''' ('''AZD-0530''') is an experimental [[drug]] being [[drug development|developed]] by [[AstraZeneca]]. It acts as a dual [[kinase inhibitor]], with selective actions as a [[Src inhibitor]] and a [[Bcr-Abl tyrosine-kinase inhibitor]].<ref>Hennequin LF, Allen J, Breed J, Curwen J, Fennell M, Green TP, Lambert-van der Brempt C, Morgentin R, Norman RA, Olivier A, Otterbein L, Plé PA, Warin N, Costello G.

However saracatinib has subsequently been researched for other applications such as [[Alzheimer's disease]]. AZD0530 is an inhibitor of Src and Abl family kinases1. It has been developed as treatment for malignancies because these kinases play a role in tumor invasion and proliferation. However, the Src family kinases (SFKs) are highly expressed in brain and have major effects on synaptic plasticity2. Moreover, the investigators have recently shown that a specific SFK, namely Fyn, is aberrantly activated by specific conformations of the Amyloid Beta (Aß) peptide from Alzheimer's disease (AD). Genetic deletion of Fyn rescues AD deficits in preclinical models. This clinical trial will test the potential benefit of AZD0530 for Alzheimer's disease modification.<ref>Gubens MA, Burns M, Perkins SM, Pedro-Salcedo MS, Althouse SK, Loehrer PJ, Wakelee HA.
