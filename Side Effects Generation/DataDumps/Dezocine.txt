==History==
Dezocine was patented by [[American Home Products|American Home Products Corp.]] in 1978. Clinical trials ran from 1979-1985, before its approval by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1986. As of 2011,<ref name="FDA Drugs">{{cite web|title=FDA Drugs|url=http://fdadrugs.legalview.com/legal-issue/dalgan}}</ref> dezocine's usage is discontinued in the United States.

===Synthesis===
Dezocine [(−)-13β-amino-5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12-octahydro-5α-methyl-5,11-methanobenxocyclodecen-31-ol, hydrobromide] is a pale white crystal powder. It has no apparent odor. The salt is soluble at 20&nbsp;mg/ml, and a 2% solution has a pH of 4.6.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Malis|first=JL|author2=Rosenthale, ME |author3=Gluckman, MI |title=Animal pharmacology of Wy-16,225, a new analgesic agent.|journal=The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics|date=September 1975|volume=194|issue=3|pages=488–98|pmid=808600}}</ref>

The synthesis of dezocine begins with the [[condensation]] of 1-methyl-7-methoxy-2-tetralone with 1,5-dibromopentane through use of NaH or potassium tertbutylate.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Freed|first=ME|author2=Potoski, JR |author3=Freed, EH |author4=Conklin, GL |author5= Malis, JL |title=Bridged aminotetralins as novel potent analgesic sunstances.|journal=Journal of Medicinal Chemistry|date=June 1973|volume=16|issue=6|pages=595–9|pmid=4714986|doi=10.1021/jm00264a003}}</ref> This yields 1-(5-bromopentyl)-1-methyl-7-methoxy-2-tetralone, which is then cyclized with NaH to produce 5-methyl-3-methoxy-5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12-octahydro-5,11-methanobenzocyclodecen-13-one. The product is then treated with hydroxylamine hydrochloride, to yield an [[oxime]]. A [[reduction reaction]] in [[hydrogen gas]] produces an [[isomer]]ic mixture, from which the final product is crystallized and cleaved with HBr.

===Legal status in United States===
As of 2011, dezocine is not used in the [[Controlled Substances Act|United States]] or [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act|Canada]]. It is not commercially available in either of these countries,<ref name="FDA Drugs"/> nor is it offered as a prescribed analgesic for postoperative care. In [[China]] however, it is commonly used after surgery.<ref name="Gharagozlou">{{cite journal|last=Gharagozlou|first=P |author2=Demirci, H |author3=David Clark, J |author4=Lameh, J|title=Activity of opioid ligands in cells expressing cloned mu opioid receptors.|journal=BMC Pharmacology|date=Jan 4, 2003|volume=3|pages=1|pmid=12513698|pmc=140036}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==

===Target action===
Dezocine has an intramuscular [[bioavailability]] of 97%.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Locniskar|first=A|author2=Greenblatt, DJ |author3=Zinny, MA |title=Pharmacokinetics of dezocine, a new analgesic: effect of dose and route of administration.|journal=European journal of clinical pharmacology|year=1986|volume=30|issue=1|pages=121–3|pmid=3709625|doi=10.1007/bf00614208}}</ref> It has a mean t<sub>1/2</sub> α of fewer than two minutes, and its [[Biological half-life|half-life]] is 2.2 hours. Its [[binding affinity]] varies with regards to the receptor type, as it acts as a partial agonist primarily on mu-opioid receptors. At kappa-opioid receptors, it acts as an antagonist.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gharagozlou|first=P|author2=Hashemi, E |author3=DeLorey, TM |author4=Clark, JD |author5= Lameh, J |title=Pharmacological profiles of opioid ligands at kappa opioid receptors.|journal=BMC Pharmacology|date=Jan 25, 2006|volume=6|pages=3|pmid=16433932|doi=10.1186/1471-2210-6-3|pmc=1403760}}</ref> Overall, it has a high efficacy as an analgesic.

With regards to its potency, it has a [[Potency (pharmacology)|Bmax]] of 3326 fmol/mg of protein in [[HEK cell]]s.<ref name="Gharagozlou" /> Dezocine is five times as potent as pethidine and one-fifth as potent as butorphanol.<ref>{{cite journal|last=O'Brien|first=JJ|author2=Benfield, P|title=Dezocine. A preliminary review of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, and therapeutic efficacy.|journal=Drugs|date=August 1989|volume=38|issue=2|pages=226–48|pmid=2670517|doi=10.2165/00003495-198938020-00005}}</ref>

Dezocine is unusual among opiates as it is one of the only [[primary amine]]s known to be an active opioid (along with [http://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C53948519&Mask=200 bisnortilidine], an active metabolite of [[tilidine]]). It is a mixed [[agonist–antagonist]] as with other drugs in this class,<ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Young, A. M. |author2=Stephens, K. R. |author3=Hein, D. W. |author4=Woods, J. H. | title = Reinforcing and Discriminative Stimulus Properties of Mixed Agonist-Antagonist Opioids | journal = Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | year = 1984 | volume = 229 | issue = 1 | pages = 118–126 | pmid = 6142942 }}</ref> and despite having a stronger respiratory depressant effect than morphine, dezocine shows a ceiling effect on its respiratory depressive action so above a certain dose this effect does not get any more severe.<ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Romagnoli, A. |author2=Keats, A. S. | title = Ceiling Respiratory Depression by Dezocine | journal = Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics | year = 1984 | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 367–373 | pmid = 6421529 | doi=10.1038/clpt.1984.45}}</ref>

Dezocine possesses affinities (K<sub>i</sub>) of 3.7 nM, 31.9 nM, and 527 nM for the [[μ-opioid receptor|μ-]], [[κ-opioid receptor|κ-]], and [[δ-opioid receptor]]s (MOR, KOR, and DOR), respectively.<ref name="LiuHuang2014">{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Renyu|last2=Huang|first2=Xi-Ping|last3=Yeliseev|first3=Alexei|last4=Xi|first4=Jin|last5=Roth|first5=Bryan L.|title=Novel Molecular Targets of Dezocine and Their Clinical Implications|journal=Anesthesiology|volume=120|issue=3|year=2014|pages=714–723|issn=0003-3022|doi=10.1097/ALN.0000000000000076|pmid=24263237|pmc=3944410}}</ref> It is a [[partial agonist]] of the MOR and a [[silent antagonist]] of the KOR.<ref name="LiuHuang2014" /> In addition to its opioid actions, dezocine has been found to act as a [[serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] (SNRI), with [[IC50|pIC<sub>50</sub>]] values of 5.86 for the [[serotonin transporter]] (SERT) and 5.68 for the [[norepinephrine transporter]] (NET).<ref name="LiuHuang2014" />

Due to its partial agonist nature at the MOR, dezocine has significantly reduced side effects relative to opioid analgesics acting as [[full agonist]]s of the MOR such as [[morphine]].<ref name="LiuHuang2014" /> Moreover, dezocine is not a controlled substance and there are no reports of addiction related to its use, indicating that, unlike virtually all other clinically-employed MOR agonists (including weak partial agonists like [[buprenorphine]]) and for reasons that are not fully clear, it is apparently non-addictive.<ref name="LiuHuang2014" />

===Administration===
Dezocine is generally administered [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]]. It can also be administered in [[Intramuscular injection|intramuscular]] doses, and is given singularly rather than continuously. Dezocine has been found to be an effective painkiller comparable to [[meperidine]] (pethidine),<ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Camu, F. |author2=Gepts, E. | title = Analgesic Properties of Dezocine for Relief of Postoperative Pain | journal = Acta Anaesthesiologica Belgica | year = 1979 | volume = 30 | issue = Suppl | pages = 183–191 | pmid = 398127 }}</ref> and so is a more effective analgesic than pentazocine, but causes relatively more [[respiratory depression]] than pentazocine.<ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Wuest, H.

==Uses==

===Prescription===
Dezocine is generally administered intravenously (as Dalgan) to relieve [[Post-operative#Description of surgical procedure|post-operative]] pain in patients. Because of its high efficacy, it is often administered at a base dose of 0.1&nbsp;mg/kg. [[Respiratory depression]], a side-effect of dezocine, reaches a ceiling at 0.3-0.4&nbsp;mg/kg. It has potent analgesic results, and greater pain-relieving ability than morphine, codeine, and pethidine.<ref name="Gharagozlou" />

===Side effects===
Because decozine has mixed agonist/antagonist effects on mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors, it has a lowered [[dependence (behavioral medicine)|dependence]] potential than purely agonistic opiates. It can be prescribed, therefore, in small doses over an extended period of time without causing patients to develop and sustain an [[addiction]]. Its efficacy as an analgesic is dose-dependent; however, it displays a [[ceiling effect (pharmacology)|ceiling effect]] in induced respiratory depression at 0.3-0.4&nbsp;mg/kg.

Side effects at lower doses include mild gastrointestinal discomfort and dizziness. It is often administered in post-operative laproscopy patients as an alternative to fentanyl.
