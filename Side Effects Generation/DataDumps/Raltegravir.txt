'''Raltegravir''' ('''RAL'''), sold under the brand name '''Isentress''', is an [[antiretroviral drug]] produced by [[Merck & Co.]], used to treat [[HIV]] infection.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Savarino A |title=A historical sketch of the discovery and development of HIV-1 integrase inhibitors |journal=Expert Opin Investig Drugs |volume=15 |issue=12 |pages=1507–22 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17107277 |doi=10.1517/13543784.15.12.1507}}</ref>

}}</ref> In December 2011, it received FDA approval for pediatric use in patients ages 2–18, taken in pill form orally twice a day by prescription with two other antiretroviral medications to form the cocktail (most [[Antiretroviral drug|anti-HIV drugs]] regimens for adults and children use these cocktails). Raltegravir is available in chewable form, but because the two tablet formulations are not interchangeable, the chewable pills are only approved for use in children two to 11. Older adolescents will use the adult formulation.<ref>http://www.everydayhealth.com/hiv-aids/1222/fda-okays-raltegravir-for-kids-teens-with-hiv.aspx?xid=aol_eh-hiv_6_20111219_&aolcat=HLT&icid=maing-grid7%7Cmain5%7Cdl10%7Csec3_lnk2%26pLid%3D122480</ref>

==Medical uses==
[[Image:Isentress pilules.png|thumb|left|Isentress tablets]]
Raltegravir was initially approved only for use in individuals whose infection has proven resistant to other [[HAART]] drugs.<ref name="fda_approval_package"/>  However, in July 2009, the FDA granted expanded approval for raltegravir for use in all patients.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0948398720090710 | work=Reuters | title=UPDATE 2-FDA OKs widened use of Merck's Isentress HIV drug | date=2009-07-10}}</ref>  As with any HAART medication, raltegravir is unlikely to show durability if used as monotherapy, due to the highly mutagenic nature of HIV. Raltegravir is taken orally twice daily.<ref name="fda_approval_package"/> 

===Efficacy===
In a study of the drug as part of combination therapy, raltegravir exhibited potent and durable antiretroviral activity similar to that of [[efavirenz]] at 24 and 48 weeks but achieved HIV-1 [[RNA]] levels below detection at a more rapid rate. After 24 and 48 weeks of treatment, raltegravir did not result in increased serum levels of total [[cholesterol]], [[low-density lipoprotein]] cholesterol, or [[triglycerides]].<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Markowitz M, Nguyen BY, Gotuzzo E, etal |title=Rapid and durable antiretroviral effect of the HIV-1 Integrase inhibitor raltegravir as part of combination therapy in treatment-naive patients with HIV-1 infection: results of a 48-week controlled study |journal=J.

==Side effects==
Raltegravir was generally well tolerated when used in combination with optimized background therapy regimens in treatment-experienced patients with HIV-1 infection in trials of up to 48 weeks' duration.<ref name="ralegravir">{{cite journal|vauthors=Croxtall JD, Keam SJ |url=http://adisonline.com/drugs/abstract/2009/69080/Raltegravir__A_Review_of_its_Use_in_the_Management.7.aspx |journal=Drugs |year=2009 |volume=69|pmid=19496631 |issue=8 |doi= 10.2165/00003495-200969080-00007|title=Raltegravir|pages=1059–75}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
As an [[integrase inhibitor]], raltegravir targets [[integrase]], an HIV [[enzyme]] that integrates the viral genetic material into human [[chromosomes]], a critical step in the pathogenesis of HIV. The drug is metabolized away via [[glucuronidation]].<ref>[http://www.thebody.com/content/art1352.html HIV Antiretroviral Agents in Development]</ref>

==Research==
Raltegravir significantly alters HIV viral dynamics and decay and further research in this area is ongoing. In clinical trials patients taking raltegravir achieved viral loads less than 50 copies per millitre sooner than those taking similarly potent [[Reverse transcriptase inhibitor|non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors]] or [[protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitors]]. This statistically significant difference in viral load reduction has caused some HIV researchers to begin questioning long held paradigms about HIV viral dynamics and decay.<ref>[http://www.thebody.com/content/art42654.html Faster Viral Decay With Raltegravir]</ref> Research into raltegravir's ability to affect latent viral reservoirs and possibly aid in the eradication of HIV is currently ongoing.<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00554398|Impact of MK-0518 (Raltegravir) Intensification on HIV-1 Viral Latency in Patients With Previous Complete Viral Suppression}}</ref>

Research results were published in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' on July 24, 2008. The authors concluded that "raltegravir plus optimized background therapy provided better viral suppression than optimized background therapy alone for at least 48 weeks." <ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Steigbigel RT, Cooper DA, Kumar PN, etal |title=Raltegravir with optimized background therapy for resistant HIV-1 infection |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=359 |issue=4 |pages=339–54 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18650512 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0708975 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/359/4/339 }}</ref>

Research on [[human cytomegalovirus]] (HCMV) terminase proteins demonstrated that raltegravir may block viral replication of the [[Herpesviridae|herpesviruses]].<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/09/100923081859.htm Drug against AIDS could be effective against herpesvirus<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In January 2013, a Phase II trial was initiated to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of raltegravir in treating [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS).<ref>[http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01767701 Raltegravir (Isentress) Pilot Study in Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (INSPIRE)]</ref>  The drug is active against [[Endogenous retrovirus|Human Endogenous Retroviruses]] (HERVs) and possibly [[Epstein-Barr Virus]], which have been suggested in the pathogenesis of relapsing-remitting MS.
