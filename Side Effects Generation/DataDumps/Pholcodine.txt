'''Pholcodine''' is a [[drug]] which is an [[opioid]] [[cough suppressant]] (antitussive). It helps suppress unproductive [[cough]]s and also has a mild [[sedative]] effect, but has little or no [[analgesic]] effects. It is also known as morpholinylethylmorphine and homocodeine.

Pholcodine is found in certain cough [[lozenges]].<ref>[http://www.inovapharma.com/default.aspx?page=29 inovapharma.com]</ref> However, in the UK, the preparation is almost exclusively an oral solution, typically 5&nbsp;mg / 5 ml.  Adult dosage is 5-10 ml up to 3-4 times daily.<ref>BNF (2007). British National Formulary 54. BMJ Publishing Group Ltd., RPS Publishing, London. Page 175.</ref>  Pholcodine now largely replaces the previously more common [[codeine]] linctus, as it has a much lower potential for dependence.

Pholcodine is not prescribed in the United States where it is classed as a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule I controlled substances|Schedule I]] drug, the most highly controlled drug category, which includes the likes of [[heroin]], [[LSD]] and [[MDMA|ecstasy]].<ref>US Food and Drug Administration. (2009) "Legislation - Controlled Substances" [http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Legislation/ucm148726.htm http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Legislation/ucm148726.htm]</ref>  It is a [[Drugs controlled by the UK Misuse of Drugs Act#Class B drugs|class B]] substance in the United Kingdom but can be purchased over-the-counter in most UK pharmacies.<ref>[http://www.boots.com/en/Boots-Night-Cough-Relief-150ml_17643/ "Boots Night Cough Relief"]</ref><ref>[http://www.lloydspharmacy.com/en/care-pholcodine-linctus-200ml-349629 "Care Pholcodine Linctus"]</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Pholcodine is readily absorbed from the [[gastrointestinal tract]] and freely crosses the [[blood–brain barrier]]. It acts primarily on the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), causing depression of the [[cough reflex]], partly by a direct effect on the [[cough centre]] in the [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]]. It is metabolized in the [[liver]] and its action may be prolonged in individuals with [[hepatic]] insufficiency (i.e. liver problems).  Its use is therefore contraindicated in patients with liver disease, while care is advised in patients with hepatic impairment.

==Metabolism and excretion==
Pholcodine is slowly biotransformed in the body via oxidation and conjugation to a series of metabolites that are eliminated primarily in the urine. With an average half-life of approximately 2.3 days, steady-state in someone taking the drug chronically would not be reached for nearly 2 weeks. Nearly one-half of a single dose is eventually excreted as free or conjugated parent drug. The most important urinary metabolite is conjugated morphine, which may be detectable for days or weeks after the last dose. This could trigger a positive result for opiates in a urine drug testing program.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01816483|pmid=11453092|title=Toxicological detection of pholcodine and its metabolites in urine and hair using radio immunoassay, fluorescence polarisation immunoassay, enzyme immunoassay and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry|journal=International Journal of Legal Medicine|volume=104|issue=1|pages=43–6|year=1990|last1=Maurer|first1=Hans H.|last2=Fritz|first2=Christian F.}}</ref><ref>R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 1258-1260.</ref>

==Side Effects==
Side effects are rare and may include [[dizziness]] and [[gastrointestinal disturbance]]s such as [[nausea]] or [[vomiting]]. Adverse effects such as [[constipation]], [[drowsiness]], [[Psychomotor agitation|excitation]], [[ataxia]] and [[respiratory depression]] have been reported occasionally or after large doses. The primary safety concerns with pholcodine revolve around death during general anaesthesia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/news-and-analysis/anaesthetists-campaign-for-pholcodine-cough-medicines-to-become-prescription-only-products/20067520.article|title=Anaesthetists campaign for pholcodine cough medicines to become prescription-only products|access-date=2016-09-17}}</ref>

==Anaphylaxis During General Anaesthesia==
Administration of pholcodine causes production of antibodies linked with fatalities during surgery, when essential [[neuromuscular blocking agents]] (NMBAs) are administered to prevent patient movement under [[general anaesthesia]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.iac.2009.04.002|pmid=19563989|title=The Pholcodine Story|journal=Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America|volume=29|issue=3|pages=419–27|year=2009|last1=Florvaag|first1=E.|last2=Johansson|first2=S.G.O.}}</ref> These antibody levels gradually fall to low levels several years after last dose of pholcodine. However, the presence of these antibodies causes a 300-fold increase in risk of [[anaphylaxis]] during anaesthesia.<ref name=pmid23283141>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/WOX.0b013e318261eccc|pmid=23283141|title=The Pholcodine Case. Cough Medicines, IgE-Sensitization, and Anaphylaxis|journal=World Allergy Organization Journal|volume=5|issue=7|pages=73–8|year=2012|last1=Florvaag|first1=E.|last2=Johansson|first2=S. G. O.|pmc=3651177}}</ref>
 
The link was suspected when neighbouring [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] were found to have tenfold differences of surgical anaphylaxis deaths. Sweden had no products approved containing pholcodine, whereas 40% of the population in Norway had consumed the single approved pholcodine product.<ref name=pmid23283141/> Norway withdrew pholcodine from the market in 2007, and the prevalence of anti-suxamethonium antibodies fell by over 80% in two years.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1398-9995.2010.02518.x|pmid=21241314|title=IgE-sensitization to the cough suppressant pholcodine and the effects of its withdrawal from the Norwegian market|journal=Allergy|volume=66|issue=7|pages=955–60|year=2011|last1=Florvaag|first1=E.|last2=Johansson|first2=S. G. O.|last3=Irgens|first3=Å.|last4=De Pater|first4=G. H.}}</ref> A corresponding fall in anaesthesia deaths followed.<ref name=pmid23283141/>

A similar disparity exists between NMBA anaphylaxis rates in [[Australia]], where pholcodine consumption is high and the [[US]], where pholcodine is banned.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/bja/aes506|pmid=23335568|title=Anaphylaxis to neuromuscular blocking drugs: Incidence and cross-reactivity in Western Australia from 2002 to 2011|journal=British Journal of Anaesthesia|volume=110|issue=6|pages=981–7|year=2013|last1=Sadleir|first1=P. H. M.|last2=Clarke|first2=R. C.|last3=Bunning|first3=D. L.|last4=Platt|first4=P. R.}}</ref> In the US, anaphylaxis rates are so low that some anaesthetists question the existence of such reactions to NMBAs.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1213/01.ANE.0000115146.70209.4B|title=Anaphylactic Reactions to Neuromuscular Blocking Drugs: Are We Making the Correct Diagnosis?|journal=Anesthesia & Analgesia|pages=881–883|year=2004|last1=Levy|first1=Jerrold H.}}</ref> Conversely, Australian anaesthetists have requested a ban on pholcodine<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Crilly |first1=Helen |first2=Michael |last2=Rose |title=Anaphylaxis and anaesthesia–can treating a cough kill? |journal=Australian Prescriber |year=2014 |pages=74 |url=http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/37/3/article/1500.pdf}}</ref> due to the high anaphylaxis rate in the country.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.5415/apallergy.2014.4.2.86|pmid=24809013|title=Pholcodine consumption and immunoglobulin E-sensitization in atopics from Australia, Korea, and Japan|journal=Asia Pacific Allergy|volume=4|issue=2|pages=86–90|year=2014|last1=Katelaris|first1=Constance H.|last2=Kurosawa|first2=Motohiro|last3=Moon|first3=Hee-Bom|last4=Borres|first4=Magnus|last5=Florvaag|first5=Erik|last6=Johansson|first6=Stig Gunnar Olof|pmc=4005347}}</ref> However, the [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] declined the request in January 2015,<ref>"Cough medicine alert over surgery ", The Age, January 5, 2015. http://www.theage.com.au/national/health/cough-medicine-alert-over-surgery-20150105-12i8sq.html</ref> pending further reviews to follow.

In contrast, the European Medicines Agency's 2012 "Assesment report for Pholcodine containing medicinal products" concludes this: 
The Committee considered that evidence of an association between pholcodine use and development of
NMBA-related anaphylaxis is circumstantial, not entirely consistent and therefore does not support the
conclusion that there is a significant risk of cross-sensitisation to NMBAs and subsequent development
of anaphylaxis during surgery.<ref>http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Referrals_document/Pholcodine_31/WC500124716.pdf?UNLID=559983127201732412541</ref>
