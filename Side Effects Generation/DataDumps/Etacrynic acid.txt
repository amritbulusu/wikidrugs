'''Etacrynic acid''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) or '''ethacrynic acid''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]), trade name '''Edecrin''', is a [[loop diuretic]] used to treat [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] and the [[edema|swelling]] caused by diseases like [[congestive heart failure]], [[liver failure]], and [[kidney failure]].

Unlike the other loop diuretics, etacrynic acid is not a [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]]<ref name="pmid19142157">{{cite journal |author=Somberg JC, Molnar J |title=The Pleiotropic Effects of Ethacrynic Acid |journal=Am J Ther |volume= 16|issue= 1|pages= 102–4|date=January 2009 |pmid=19142157 |doi=10.1097/MJT.0b013e3181961264 |url=|last2=Molnar }}</ref> and thus, its use is not contraindicated in those with sulfa allergies.

Ethacrynic acid is a phenoxyacetic acid derivative containing a [[ketone|ketone group]] and a [[methylene group]]. A cysteine adduct is formed with the methylene group and this is the active form.

==Medical use==
Ethacrynic acid is a diuretic that is used to treat [[edema]] when a stronger agent is required.  It is available as a pill or injected form.  The pill is used to treat edema associated with [[congestive heart failure]], [[cirrhosis]] and [[renal disease]], [[Ascites|accumulation of liquid in the belly]] associated with cancer or edema,  and management of hospitalized children with [[congenital heart disease]] or [[nephrotic syndrome]].
The injected form is used to rapidly remove water from the body when needed - for example in acute [[pulmonary edema]] - or when a person cannot take the medicine in pill form.<ref name=Label>Merck and FDA [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2005/16092s042,16093s044lbl.pdf Etacrynic acid Label].

==Adverse effects==
As a [[diuretic]], ethacrynic acid can cause frequent urination, but this usually resolves after taking the drug for a few weeks.

Ethacrynic acid can also cause [[hypokalemia|low potassium levels]], which may manifest as muscle cramps or weakness. It has also been known to cause reversible or permanent hearing loss ([[ototoxicity]])<ref name="pmid7446061">{{cite journal |author=Bosher SK |title=The nature of the ototoxic actions of ethacrynic acid upon the mammalian endolymph system.

On oral administration, it produces diarrhea; intestinal bleeding may occur at higher doses.

==Mechanism of action==
Ethacrynic acid acts by inhibiting [[NKCC2]] in the thick [[thick ascending limb of loop of Henle|ascending loop of Henle]] and the [[Macula densa|Macula Densa]]. Loss of potassium ions is less marked but chances of hypochloremic alkalosis are greater. The dose response curve of ethacrynic acid is steeper than that of furosemide and, in general, it is less manageable; dose range is 50-150mg.

Ethacrynic acid and its glutathione-adduct are potent inhibitors of [[glutathione S-transferase|glutathione ''S''-transferase]] family members, which are enzymes involved in [[xenobiotic metabolism]]. This family of enzymes has recently been shown to have a high rate of genetic variability.
