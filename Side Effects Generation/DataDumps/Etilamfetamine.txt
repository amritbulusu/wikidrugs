'''Etilamfetamine''' ('''Apetinil''', '''Adiparthrol'''), also known as '''''N''-ethylamphetamine''', is a [[stimulant]] drug of the [[substituted phenethylamine|phenethylamine]] and [[substituted amphetamine|amphetamine]] [[chemical class]]es. It was invented in the early 20th century and was subsequently used as an [[anorectic]] or [[appetite suppressant]] in the 1950s,<ref>{{Cite journal

== Chemistry ==
The [[molecular structure]] of ethylamphetamine is [[Structural analog|analogous]] to amphetamine's.<ref group="Note">Amphetamine is a substituted phenethylamine with a [[methyl group]] at R<sup>A</sup> position.</ref> It is a [[substituted amphetamine]], with an [[ethyl group]] on the amphetamine backbone.<ref group="Note">The [[ethyl group]] of ethylamphetamine is at R<sup>N</sup> position, hence the name ''N-ethylamphetamine''.</ref><ref group="Note">Ethylamphetamine is structurally similar to [[methamphetamine|N-methylamphetamine]] (methamphetamine), the [[ethyl group]] being replaced in methamphetamine with a [[methyl group]].</ref>

== Recreational use ==
Ethylamphetamine can be used as a [[recreational drug]] and, while its prevalence is less than amphetamine's, it is still encountered as a substance taken for recreational purposes.

Ethylamphetamine produces effects similar to amphetamine and methamphetamine, its [[potency (pharmacology)|potency]] being lesser than either amphetamine's or methamphetamine's.<ref group="Note">Ethylamphetamine's higher potency may make its risk of causing [[Drug abuse|abuse]], [[Substance dependence|dependence]] and/or addiction greater compared to amphetamine.</ref><ref group="Note">A cohort of Australian users in the 1990s found single 40 mg doses of commercially produced racemic ethylamphetamine hydrochloride substantially less effective recreationally than 40 mg doses of either racemic amphetamine sulphate, d-methylamphetamine hydrochloride or racemic fenethylline hydrochloride.</ref>
