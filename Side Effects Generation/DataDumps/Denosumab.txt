Denosumab is contraindicated in people with [[hypocalcemia|low blood calcium levels]].

The most common side effects are [[Arthralgia|joint]] and [[Myalgia|muscle pain]] in the arms or legs.<ref name="EMEA" />

Denosumab is a [[RANKL inhibitor]],<ref name="pmid_20065634"/> which works by preventing the development of [[osteoclast]]s which are cells that break down bone. It was developed by the biotechnology company [[Amgen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amgen.com/medpro/products_prolia.html|publisher=Amgen|accessdate=6 May 2012|title=Prolia (denosumab)|work=Products}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
Denosumab is used for those with [[osteoporosis]] at high risk for [[fracture]]s, bone loss due to certain medications, and in those with [[bone metastases]].<ref name=AHFS2014>{{cite web|title=Denosumab

===Cancer===
A 2012 meta-analysis found that denosumab was better than placebo, [[zoledronic acid]] and [[pamidronate]] in reducing the risk of fractures in those with cancer.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lipton|first1=A|last2=Fizazi|first2=K|last3=Stopeck|first3=AT|last4=Henry|first4=DH|last5=Brown|first5=JE|last6=Yardley|first6=DA|last7=Richardson|first7=GE|last8=Siena|first8=S|last9=Maroto|first9=P|last10=Clemens|first10=M|last11=Bilynskyy|first11=B|last12=Charu|first12=V|last13=Beuzeboc|first13=P|last14=Rader|first14=M|last15=Viniegra|first15=M|last16=Saad|first16=F|last17=Ke|first17=C|last18=Braun|first18=A|last19=Jun|first19=S|title=Superiority of denosumab to zoledronic acid for prevention of skeletal-related events: a combined analysis of 3 pivotal, randomised, phase 3 trials.|journal=EJC (Oxford, England : 1990)|date=November 2012|volume=48|issue=16|pages=3082–92|pmid=22975218|doi=10.1016/j.ejca.2012.08.002}}</ref>

===Osteoporosis===

==Contraindications and interactions==
It is contraindicated in people with [[hypocalcemia]], and sufficient calcium and [[vitamin D]] levels must be reached before starting on denosumab therapy.<ref name="AustriaCodex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|at=Prolia-Injektionslösung in einer Fertigspritze|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2017|isbn=3-85200-196-X|language=German}}</ref> Data regarding interactions with other drugs are missing. It is unlikely that denosumab exhibits any clinically relevant interactions.<ref name="AustriaCodex" />

Denosumab works by lowering the hormonal message that leads to excessive osteoclast-driven bone removal and is active in the body for only six months. Similarly to [[bisphosphonate]]s, denosumab appears to be implicated in increasing the risk of [[osteonecrosis of the jaw]] (ONJ) following extraction of teeth or oral surgical procedures but, unlike bisphosphonate, the risk declines to zero approximately 6 months after injection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todaysgeriatricmedicine.com/archive/110310p6.shtml|title=Injectable Prolia — Osteoporosis Update|publisher=}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
[[Bone remodeling]] is the process by which the body continuously removes old bone tissue and replaces it with new bone. It is driven by various types of cells, most notably [[osteoblast]]s (which secrete new bone) and [[osteoclast]]s (which break down bone); [[osteocyte]]s are also present in bone, but their role is still not well understood.

Precursors to osteoclasts, called pre-osteoclasts, express surface receptors called RANK (receptor activator of [[NF-κB|nuclear factor-kappa B]]). RANK is a member of the [[tumor necrosis factor receptor]] (TNFR) superfamily. RANK is activated by RANKL (the RANK-Ligand), which exists as cell surface molecules on osteoblasts. Activation of RANK by RANKL promotes the maturation of pre-osteoclasts into osteoclasts. Denosumab inhibits this maturation of osteoclasts by binding to and inhibiting RANKL. This mimics the natural action of [[osteoprotegerin]], an endogenous RANKL inhibitor, that presents with decreasing concentrations (and perhaps decreased [[avidity]]) in patients who are suffering from osteoporosis. This protects bone from degradation, and helps to counter the progression of the disease.<ref name="pmid16495394" />

==Regulatory approval==

===United States===
In June 2010, denosumab was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for use in postmenopausal women with risk of osteoporosis under the trade name ''Prolia'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biosciencetechnology.com/News/FeedsAP/2010/06/fda-clears-amgens-bone-strengthening-drug-prolia/ |title=FDA clears Amgen's bone-strengthening drug Prolia |author=Matthew Perrone |publisher=BioScience Technology |date=June 2, 2010}}</ref> and in November 2010, as ''Xgeva'', for the prevention of skeleton-related events in patients with [[bone metastases]] from solid tumors.<ref name=Nov2010 /> Denosumab is the first [[RANKL inhibitor]] to be approved by the FDA.<ref name=FDA-deno>{{cite news |url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/Endocrinology/Osteoporosis/20432 |title=FDA Approves Denosumab for Osteoporosis |date=2 June 2010 }}</ref>

On 13 August 2009, a meeting was held between Amgen and the Advisory Committee for Reproductive Health Drugs (ACRHD) of the (FDA) to review the potential uses of denosumab.<ref>{{cite web |title=Amgen Issues Statement on Outcomes of Advisory Committee for Reproductive Health Drugs (ACRHD) Meeting |publisher=PRNewswire/FirstCall |date=August 13, 2009 |url=http://www.urotoday.com/3401/browse_categories/prostate_cancer/amgen_issues_statement_on_outcomes_of_advisory_committee_for_reproductive_health_drugs_acrhd_meeting08192009.html}}</ref>

In October 2009, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) delayed approval of denosumab, stating that they needed more information.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/20/business/20amgen.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=F.D.A. Says No to an Amgen Bone Drug|date=19 October 2009|last=Pollack|first=Andrew}}</ref>

On 2 June 2010, denosumab was approved for post-menopausal osteoporosis by the US FDA.<ref name=FDA-deno/>

In November 2010, the US FDA approved denosumab (to be marketed as ''Xgeva'') for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with bone [[metastases|metastasis]] from solid [[tumor]]s.<ref name=Nov2010>{{cite news |url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/amgen-s-denosumab-cleared-by-fda-for-second-indication/81244270/ |title=Amgen's Denosumab Cleared by FDA for Second Indication |date=19 Nov 2010 }}</ref>

On 13 June 2013, the US FDA approved denosumab for treatment of adults and skeletally mature adolescents with giant cell tumor of bone that is unresectable or where resection would result in significant morbidity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/druginfo/fda-denosumab|title=FDA Approval for Denosumab|publisher=}}</ref>

===Europe===
On 17 December 2009, the [[Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use]] (CHMP) issued a Positive Opinion for denosumab for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women and for the treatment of bone loss in men with [[Androgen deprivation therapy|hormone ablation therapy for prostate cancer]].<ref name="EMEA">European Medicines Agency. European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) for Prolia. Updated October 16, 2014. [http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Summary_for_the_public/human/001120/WC500093527.pdf]</ref> Denosumab was approved for marketing by the European Commission on 28 May 2010.
