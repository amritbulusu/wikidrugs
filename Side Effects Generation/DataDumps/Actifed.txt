'''Actifed''' is a [[registered trademark]] for a combination [[antihistamine]] and [[nasal decongestant]] medication used for [[common cold|cold]] and [[allergy]] symptoms.  Developed in 1958 by Burroughs Wellcome & Company (now part of [[GlaxoSmithKline]]),<ref>[http://www.gsk.com/about/history-noflash.htm# Our history - About GlaxoSmithKline]</ref> the product was later acquired by [[Pfizer]], and was most recently sold by [[Johnson & Johnson]].  In the U.S., the formula was changed in 2006 due to a change in the legal environment; at the same time, distribution of the product was limited to certain stores. The United States Food and Drug Administration, [[FDA]], lists Actifed as discontinued.

==2006 U.S. formula change==

The original formula for Actifed contained [[pseudoephedrine]] hydrochloride 60&nbsp;mg as the nasal decongestant and [[triprolidine]] hydrochloride 2.5&nbsp;mg as the antihistamine.  However, in response to widespread laws requiring products containing pseudoephedrine to be kept behind the pharmacy counter, Pfizer changed Actifed's U.S. formula in late 2006 to contain [[chlorpheniramine]] maleate 4&nbsp;mg as the antihistamine and [[phenylephrine]] HCl 10&nbsp;mg as the nasal decongestant.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pfizerch.com/faq.aspx?brand=35#FAQ1461 |title=FAQ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027090000/http://www.pfizerch.com/faq.aspx?brand=35 |archivedate=October 27, 2007 |work=pfizerch.com}}</ref>  Many users of the old formula have complained that the new formula is not as effective at relieving their symptoms.  Other brands available behind the counter that use the old formula include '''Genac''' and '''Aprodine'''. The American pharmacy chain [[Walgreens]] produced a house-brand version of Actifed, '''Wal-Act''', which used the original pseudoephedrine/triprolidine formula.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.walgreens.com/store/c/walgreens-wal-act-cold-%26-allergy-medicine-tablets/ID=prod6012402-product |title=Walgreens Wal-Act Cold & Allergy Medicine Tablets}}</ref>

In the UK, Germany, Italy, and Thailand the formulation remained unchanged. The product is available [[Over-the-counter]] as a pack of 12 tablets produced by McNeil. Each tablet contains [[Triprolidine hydrochloride]] 2.5&nbsp;mg and [[Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride]] 60&nbsp;mg.

In Germany, the product is marketed under the registered trademark '''Rhino PRONT'''.

==Apollo missions==

Actifed was included in the standard medical kit aboard the [[United States]] [[Apollo mission]]s, and was used during [[Apollo 7]] and [[Apollo 12]] when crew members developed head cold symptoms.<ref>[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-368/s2ch1.htm SP-368 Biomedical Results of Apollo], NASA</ref>  When Actifed was made available over-the-counter, former astronauts from the Apollo missions appeared in commercials promoting the product.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olz6c0NZn7I YouTube video of astronauts' advertisement]</ref>
