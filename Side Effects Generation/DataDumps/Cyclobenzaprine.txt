== Medical use ==

After sustaining an injury, painful muscle spasms may occur to stabilize the affected body part and prevent further damage.

Cyclobenzaprine has also shown effectiveness in the treatment of [[fibromyalgia]] symptoms, with a reported [[Number needed to treat]] of 4.8 (meaning that 1 patient out of every 4.8 benefits from treatment) for pain reduction, but no change in fatigue or tender points.<ref name = tofferi>{{cite journal |journal = [[Arthritis Rheum.]] |date = 15 February 2004 |volume = 51 |issue = 1 |pages = 9–13 |title = Treatment of fibromyalgia with cyclobenzaprine: A meta-analysis |vauthors = Tofferi JK, Jackson JL, O'Malley PG |pmid = 14872449 |doi = 10.1002/art.20076 }}</ref> It may also be used along with other treatments for [[tetanus]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Blaine T.|last2=Smith|first2=Visiting Professor University of Oklahoma College of Pharmacy Blaine T.|title=Pharmacology for Nurses|date=2014|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Publishers|isbn=9781449689407|page=122|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=7P-9BQAAQBAJ&pg=PA122#v=onepage&q&f=false|language=en}}</ref>

The sedative effects of cyclobenzaprine are likely due to its antagonistic effect on [[H1 receptor|histamine]], [[Serotonin receptor|serotonin]], and [[muscarinic receptor]]s. Agitation is a common side effect observed especially in the elderly. In general, the [[National Committee for Quality Assurance]] recommends avoiding the use of cyclobenzaprine in the elderly because of the potential for more severe side effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncqa.org/Portals/0/Newsroom/SOHC/Drugs_Avoided_Elderly.pdf |accessdate=22 February 2010 |title=High risk medications |format=PDF |work=[[National Committee for Quality Assurance]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201113909/http://www.ncqa.org/Portals/0/Newsroom/SOHC/Drugs_Avoided_Elderly.pdf |archivedate=1 February 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref> Treatment protocols and support should follow the same as for any structurally related [[tricyclic]], such as [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s.<ref name=chabria>{{cite journal |last = Chabria |first = Shiven B |url = http://www.occup-med.com/content/1/1/16 |journal = Journal of Occupational Medicine and Toxicology |title = Rhabdomyolysis: a manifestation of cyclobenzaprine toxicity |date = 17 July 2006 |volume = 1 |page = 16 |pmid = 16846511 |doi = 10.1186/1745-6673-1-16 |pmc = 1540431 |issue = 1 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061021190258/http://www.occup-med.com/content/1/1/16 |archivedate = 21 October 2006 }}</ref>

Some experts believe that cyclobenzaprine should be avoided in elderly patients because it can cause confusion, delirium, and cognitive impairment.<ref>Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health; 2015 Feb 23. Long-term Use of Cyclobenzaprine for Pain: A Review of the Clinical Effectiveness. {{PMID|25763449}}</ref><ref>Potentially inappropriate medications for the elderly according to the revised Beers criteria. 2012.

=== Overdose ===
The most common effects of overdose are drowsiness and [[tachycardia]].<ref name = FDA /> Rare but potentially critical complications are [[cardiac arrest]], [[cardiac dysrhythmia|abnormal heart rhythms]], severe [[hypotension|low blood pressure]], [[seizure]]s, and [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]].<ref name = FDA /> Life-threatening overdose is rare,<ref name = FDA /> however, as the [[median lethal dose]] is about 338&nbsp;milligrams/kilogram in mice and 425&nbsp;mg/kg in rats.<ref name = FDA /> The potential harm is increased when [[Depressant|central nervous system depressants]] and antidepressants are also used; deliberate overdose often includes [[alcohol]] among other drugs.<ref name = FDA />

== Interactions ==
Cyclobenzaprine has major contraindications with [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAOIs). At least one study also found increased risk of [[serotonin syndrome]] when cyclobenzaprine was taken with the serotonergic drugs [[duloxetine]] or [[phenelzine]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1 = Keegan MT |author2 = Brown DR |author3 = Rabinstein AA |year = 2006 |title = [[Serotonin syndrome]] from the interaction of cyclobenzaprine with other [[serotoninergic]] drugs |journal = Anesthesia & Analgesia |volume = 103 |pages = 1466–8 |pmid = 17122225 |doi = 10.1213/01.ane.0000247699.81580.eb |issue = 6 }}</ref>

These substances may interact with cyclobenzaprine:

* Central nervous system <!-- (CNS) --> [[depressant]]s (e.g. [[Ethanol|alcohol]], [[opioid]]s, [[benzodiazepine]]s, [[nonbenzodiazepine]]s, [[phenothiazine]]s,  [[Carbamate#In human medicine|carbamates]], [[barbiturate]]s, [[antipsychotics|major tranquilizers]])
* [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s taken within two weeks of cyclobenzaprine may result in serious, life-threatening side effects.<ref name = drugs.com />

Cyclobenzaprine may affect the medications used in [[general anesthesia|surgical sedation]] and some surgeons request that patients temporarily discontinue its use prior to surgery. The prescribing physician should be consulted prior to discontinuing, and resuming, cyclobenzaprine.<ref>{{cite web|title=Medications to Avoid, Continue, or Stop - Before & After Surgery|author=Medical Practice of William H. Gorman, M.D.|url=https://www.whgormanmd.com/blog/2014/1/3/medications-to-avoid-continue-or-stop-before-surgery|date=Feb 18, 2014}}</ref>

== Comparison to other medications ==

Cyclobenzaprine has been found to be not inferior to [[tizanidine]], [[orphenadrine]], and [[carisoprodol]] in the treatment of acute lower back pain, although none has been proven to be effective for long-term use (beyond two weeks of treatment). No differences in pain or spasm scores were noted among these agents, nor when compared to benzodiazepines.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/572676_4 |title = Medscape: Medscape Access |work = medscape.com |accessdate = 1 October 2016 }}</ref> However, nonbenzodiazepine (including cyclobenzaprine) treatment was found to have a lower risk of medication abuse and continuation of use against medical advice. Side effects such as sedation and [[ataxia]] are also less pronounced with nonbenzodiazepine antispasmodics.

In a study on the treatment of musculoskeletal pain treatment with cyclobenzaprine alone or in combination with [[ibuprofen]], no significant differences in pain scores were noted among the three treatment groups. Peak benefit was found to occur on day seven of the treatment for all groups.<ref>{{cite journal |url = http://www.annemergmed.com/article/S0196-0644(04)01009-1 |doi = 10.1016/j.annemergmed.2004.07.286 |title = Comparison of cyclobenzaprine alone versus cyclobenzaprine plus ibuprofen in patients with acute musculoskeletal spasm and pain |journal = Annals of Emergency Medicine |volume = 44 |issue = 4 |pages = S87 |year = 2004 |last1 = Childers |first1 = M.K. |last2 = Petri |first2 = M. |last3 = Laudadio |first3 = C. |last4 = Harrison |first4 = D. |last5 = Silber |first5 = S. |last6 = Bowen |first6 = D. }}{{dead link|date=October 2016}}</ref>

== Formulations ==

[[File:Cyclobenzaprine10mg.png|thumb|Cyclobenzaprine 10mg]]

By mouth, cyclobenzaprine is marketed as Apo-Cyclobenzaprin, Fexmid, Flexeril and Novo-Cycloprine. It is available in generic form. A once-a-day, extended-release formulation, Amrix, is available.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.amrix.com/ |title = Patient Web site for AMRIX® (Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride Extended‐Release Capsules) |work = amrix.com |accessdate = 1 October 2016 }}</ref> Cyclobenzaprine is also used by compounding pharmacies in topical creams.

Cyclobenzaprine is regulated in the U.S. for [[Medical prescription|prescription]] use only. Though it does not fall within most governmental guidelines as a controlled substance, possession of it without a valid or current prescription may be illegal, depending upon various state and local laws.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

== Research ==
A rapidly absorbed form of cyclobenzaprine is being studied in the treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.tonixpharma.com/research-development/tnx-102-sl-for-ptsd |title = TNX-102 SL for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder :: Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp.
