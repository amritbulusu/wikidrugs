==Medical uses==
It is primarily given once or twice weekly by intramuscular injection for moderate-severe [[rheumatoid arthritis]] although it has also proven itself effective in treating [[tuberculosis]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Benedek|first=TG|title=The history of gold therapy for tuberculosis.|journal=Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences|date=January 2004|volume=59|issue=1|pages=50–89|doi=10.1093/jhmas/jrg042|pmid=15011812}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Its most common side effects are digestive (mostly [[dyspepsia]], [[stomatitis|mouth swelling]], nausea, vomiting and taste disturbance), vasomotor (mostly flushing, fainting, dizziness, sweating, weakness, palpitations, [[dyspnoea|shortness of breath]] and blurred vision) or dermatologic (usually itchiness, rash, local irritation near to the injection site and hair loss) in nature, although [[conjunctivitis]], blood dyscrasias, kidney damage, [[arthralgia|joint pain]], [[myalgia|muscle aches/pains]] and liver dysfunction are also common.<ref name="AMH">{{cite book | editor = Rossi, S | isbn = 978-0-9805790-9-3 | title = Australian Medicines Handbook | place = Adelaide | publisher = The Australian Medicines Handbook Unit Trust | year = 2013 | edition = 2013 }}</ref> Less commonly, it can cause GI bleeds, dry mucous membranes and [[gingivitis]].<ref name = AMH/> Rarely it can cause: [[aplastic anaemia]], ulcerative enterocolitis, [[dysphagia|difficulty swallowing]], [[angiooedema]], [[pneumonitis]], [[pulmonary fibrosis]], hepatotoxicity, [[cholestatic jaundice]], [[peripheral neuropathy]], [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]], [[encephalopathy]], [[encephalitis]] and [[photosensitivity]].<ref name = AMH/>

==Pharmacology==
Its precise mechanism of action is unknown but is known that it inhibits the synthesis of [[prostaglandins]].<ref name = mech08/> It also modulates [[phagocytic cells]] and inhibits class II [[major histocompatibility complex]]-peptide interactions.<ref name = mech08/> It is also known that it inhibits the following enzymes:<ref name = mech08/><ref name = rsc>{{cite journal|last=Berners-Price|first=SJ|author2=Filipovska, A |title=Gold compounds as therapeutic agents for human diseases.|journal=Metallomics|date=September 2011|volume=3|issue=9|pages=863–73|doi=10.1039/c1mt00062d|pmid=21755088}}</ref>

==History of use==
Reports of favorable use of the compound were published in France in 1929 by [[Jacques Forestier]].<ref name=freyberg> {{cite journal|last=Freyberg|first=R.H.|title=Metabolism, toxicity and manner of action of gold compounds used in the treatment of arthritis. I. Human plasma and synovial fluid concentration and urinary excretion of gold during and following treatment with gold sodium thiomalate, gold sodium thiosulfate, and colloidal gold sulfide |journal=J Clin Invest|date=July 1941|volume=20|issue=4|pages=401–412|doi=10.1172/jci101235|pmc=435072 |display-authors=etal|pmid=16694848}}</ref> The use of gold salts was then a controversial treatment and  was not immediately accepted by the international community. Success was found in the treatment of [[Raoul Dufy]]'s joint pain by the use of gold salts in 1940; "(The treatment) brought in a few weeks such a spectacular sense of healing, that Dufy ... boasted of again having the ability to catch a tram on the move." <ref> {{cite journal |last=Lamboley |first=Claude |date=December 6, 2010 |title=Deux rhumatisants au soleil du Midi : Renoir et Dufy  |trans-title=Two rheumatic in the Midi sun: Renoir and Dufy |url=http://www.ac-sciences-lettres-montpellier.fr/academie_edition/fichiers_conf/LAMBOLEY-2010.pdf |language= French|journal=Académie des Sciences et Lettres de Montpellier |location=Montpellier |publisher= |access-date=July 7, 2015 }}</ref>

==In popular culture==
*The compound was used as a poison by a patient's wife in an episode of ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' ("Clueless", season 2 episode 15).
