'''Isoxicam''' is a [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] (NSAID) that was taken or applied to reduce [[inflammation]] and as an [[analgesic]] reducing pain in certain conditions. The drug was introduced in 1983 by the [[Warner-Lambert Company]]. Isoxicam is a chemical analog of [[piroxicam]] (Feldene) which has a pyridine ring in lieu of an isoxazole ring. In 1985 Isoxicam was withdrawn from the French market, due to adverse effects, namely [[Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis]] ([[Lyell syndrome]]) resulting in death. Although these serious side affects were observed only in France, the drug was withdrawn worldwide.<ref>''Consolidated List of products whose consumption and/or sale have been banned, withdrawn, severely restricted or not approved by Governments'', United Nations, 2003, p. 123 [http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/m/abstract/Js16780e/ link to 2005 ed]</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Fung|first=M.|author2=Thornton, A. |author3=Mybeck, K. |author4=Wu, J.
