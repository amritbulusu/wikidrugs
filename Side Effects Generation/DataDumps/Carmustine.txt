'''Carmustine''' ('''bis-chloroethylnitrosourea''', '''BCNU''', '''BiCNU''') is a [[pharmaceutical drug|medication]] used mainly for [[chemotherapy]] and sometimes for [[immunosuppression]] before [[organ transplantation]]. It is a [[nitrogen mustard]] β-chloro-[[nitrosourea compounds|nitrosourea compound]] used as an [[alkylating antineoplastic agent|alkylating agent]]. As a dialkylating agent, BCNU is able to form interstrand crosslinks in [[DNA]], which prevents DNA replication and DNA transcription.

It has the appearance of an orange-yellow solid.

Carmustine for injection was earlier marketed under the name BiCNU by Bristol-Myers Squibb<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bms.com/news/features/2012/Pages/CompanyStatementonBiCNU.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140711101801/http://www.bms.com/news/features/2012/Pages/CompanyStatementonBiCNU.aspx |archivedate=2014-07-11 |df= }}</ref> and now by [[Emcure Pharmaceuticals]].<ref>[http://www.emcure.co.in/news/docs/BiCNU%20Emcure%20press%20release.pdf Emcure Press release]</ref>  In India it is sold under various brand names, including Consium.

==Uses==
It is used in the treatment of several types of [[brain cancer]] (including [[glioma]], [[glioblastoma multiforme]], [[medulloblastoma]] and [[astrocytoma]]), [[multiple myeloma]] and [[lymphoma]] ([[Hodgkin's lymphoma|Hodgkin's]] and [[Non-Hodgkin lymphoma|non-Hodgkin]]). BCNU is sometimes used in conjunction with alkyl guanine transferase (AGT) inhibitors, such as [[O6-Benzylguanine|''O''<sup>6</sup>-benzylguanine]]. The AGT-inhibitors increase the efficacy of BCNU by inhibiting the [[DNA repair#Direct reversal|direct reversal pathway]] of DNA repair, which will prevent formation of the [[Crosslinking of DNA|interstrand crosslink]] between the N<sup>1</sup> of [[guanine]] and the N<sup>3</sup> of [[cytosine]].

It is also used as part of a chemotherapeutic protocol in preparation for hematological [[stem cell transplantation]], a type of [[bone marrow transplant]], in order to reduce the white blood cell count in the recipient (patient). Use under this protocol, usually with Fludarabine and Melphalan, was coined by oncologists at the [[University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center]].

==Implants==
In the treatment of [[brain tumour]]s, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved [[biodegradable]] discs infused with carmustine (Gliadel).<ref name="pmid17575228">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ewend MG, Brem S, Gilbert M |title=Treatment of single brain metastasis with resection, intracavity carmustine polymer wafers, and radiation therapy is safe and provides excellent local control |journal=Clin.

The disc allows for controlled release of carmustine in the extracellular fluid of the brain, thus eliminating the need for the encapsulated drug to cross the blood-brain barrier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/hmn/W05/feature3.cfm|title=Hopkins Medicine Magazine - In Spite of All Odds|publisher=}}</ref>
