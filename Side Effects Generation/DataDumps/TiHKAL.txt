'''''TIHKAL: The Continuation''''' is a 1997 book written by [[Alexander Shulgin]] and [[Ann Shulgin]] about a family of [[psychoactive drug]]s known as [[tryptamine]]s. A sequel to ''[[PIHKAL|PIHKAL: A Chemical Love Story]]'', ''TIHKAL'' is an [[acronym]] that stands for "Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved."

==Content==
''TIHKAL'', much like its predecessor ''PIHKAL'', is divided into two parts. The first part, for which all rights are reserved, begins with a fictionalized autobiography, picking up where the similar section of ''PIHKAL'' left off; it then continues with a collection of essays on topics ranging from [[psychotherapy]] and the [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] mind to the prevalence of [[dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] in nature, [[ayahuasca]] and the [[War on Drugs]]. The second part of ''TIHKAL'', which may be conditionally distributed for non-commercial reproduction (see [[#External links|external links]] below), is a detailed synthesis manual for 55 psychedelic compounds (many discovered by Alexander Shulgin himself), including their chemical structures, dosage recommendations, and qualitative comments. Shulgin has made the second part freely available on [https://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal.shtml Erowid.org] while the first part is available only in the printed text.

Like ''PIHKAL'', the Shulgins were motivated to release the synthesis information as a way to protect the public's access to information about psychedelic compounds, a goal Alexander Shulgin has noted many times.<ref name="nyt">

Agents tell me that in clandestine labs that they have raided, they have found copies of those books."
