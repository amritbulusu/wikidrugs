===Kidney disease===
In chronic kidney diseases with [[hypoalbuminemia]], it is used along with albumin to increase diuresis. It is also used along with albumin in [[nephrotic syndrome]] to reduce edema.

===Other information===
*Excreted by tubular secretion, therefore in severe renal impairment (GFR 5–10&nbsp;ml/min) lower doses are required due to accumulation in the body. It also can cause further renal damage and should be administered with caution.
*Furosemide acts within 1&nbsp;hour of oral administration (after IV peak effect within 30&nbsp;minutes); diuresis is complete within 6&nbsp;hours (for oral administration) and 2&nbsp;hours (for IV administration).

[[Hyperglycemia]] is also a common side effect.

The tendency, as for all loop diuretics, to cause low serum potassium concentration ([[hypokalemia]]) has given rise to combination products, either with potassium itself (e.g. Lasix-K and Diumide-K Continus) or with the [[potassium-sparing diuretic]] [[amiloride]] ([[Co-amilofruse]]).

===Interactions===
Furosemide has potential interactions with these medications:<ref>[http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/rxdrugprofiles/drugs/las1220.shtml Brand name:Lasix - Generic name: Furosemide] Prescription Drug Information, Side Effects - PDRHealth</ref>
* [[Aspirin]] and other salicylates
* Other diuretics (e.g. [[ethacrynic acid]], [[hydrochlorothiazide]])
* Synergistic effects with other [[antihypertensive]]s (e.g. [[doxazosin]])
* [[Sucralfate]]

Potentially hazardous interactions with other drugs:
*[[Analgesic]]s: increased risk of [[nephrotoxicity]] with [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s; antagonism of diuretic effect with NSAIDs
*[[Anti-arrhythmic]]s: risk of [[cardiac toxicity]] with anti-arrhythmics if [[hypokalaemia]] occurs, effects of [[lidocaine]] and [[mexiletine]] antagonised

==Mechanism of action==
{{Main article|Loop diuretic}}
Furosemide, like other loop diuretics, acts by inhibiting NKCC2, the luminal [[Na-K-Cl cotransporter]] in the [[thick ascending limb]] of the [[loop of Henle]]. The action on the distal tubules is independent of any inhibitory effect on carbonic anhydrase or aldosterone; it also abolishes the corticomedullary osmotic gradient and blocks negative, as well as positive, [[free water clearance]].

Because of the large NaCl absorptive capacity of the loop of Henle, diuresis is not limited by development of acidosis, as it is with the carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.

Additionally, furosemide is a noncompetitive subtype-specific blocker of GABA-A receptors.<ref name="Korpi95">{{cite journal |vauthors=Korpi ER, Kuner T, Seeburg PH, Lüddens H |title=Selective antagonist for the cerebellar granule cell-specific gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor |journal=Mol.

==Names==
Furosemide is the [[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]] and [[British Approved Name|BAN]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Howweregulate/Medicines/Namingofmedicines/ChangestomedicinesnamesBANstorINNs/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427025454/http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Howweregulate/Medicines/Namingofmedicines/ChangestomedicinesnamesBANstorINNs/index.htm |archivedate=2010-04-27 |df= }}</ref> The previous BAN was frusemide.

Some of the brand names under which furosemide is marketed include: Aisemide, Apo-Furosemide, Beronald, Desdemin, Discoid, Diural, Diurapid, Dryptal, Durafurid, Edemid, Errolon, Eutensin, Flusapex, Frudix, Frusetic, Frusid, Fulsix, Fuluvamide, Furesis, Furix, Furo-Puren, Furon, Furosedon, Fusid.frusone, Hydro-rapid, Impugan, Katlex, Lasilix, Lasix, Lodix, Lowpston, Macasirool, Mirfat, Nicorol, Odemase, Oedemex, Profemin, Rosemide, Rusyde, Salix, Teva-Furosemide, Trofurit, Uremide, and Urex.

==Veterinary uses==
The diuretic effects are put to use most commonly in horses to prevent bleeding during a race. Sometime in the early 1970s, furosemide's ability to prevent, or at least greatly reduce, the incidence of bleeding ([[exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage]]) by horses during races was discovered accidentally.  In the United States of America, pursuant to the racing rules of most states, horses that bleed from the nostrils three times are permanently barred from racing. Clinical trials followed, and by decade's end, racing commissions in some states in the USA began legalizing its use on race horses.  On September 1, 1995, [[New York State|New York]] became the last state in the United States to approve such use, after years of refusing to consider doing so. Some states allow its use for all racehorses; some allow it only for confirmed "bleeders".  Its use for this purpose is still prohibited in many other countries.

Furosemide is also used in horses for pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure (in combination with other drugs), and allergic reactions.  Although it increases circulation to the kidneys, it does not help kidney function, and is not recommended for kidney disease.

It is also used to treat congestive heart failure in cats and dogs (which experience fluid on the lungs) and complications from [[heartworm]].  It can be used in conjunction with an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory to treat this condition.  It can also be used in an attempt to promote diuresis in anuric or oliguric acute renal failure.

===Precautions, side effects, and administration for horses===
Furosemide is injected either [[Intramuscular injection|intramuscularly]] or [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]], usually 0.5-1.0&nbsp;mg/kg twice/day, although less before a horse is raced. As with many diuretics, it can cause [[dehydration]] and [[electrolyte imbalance]], including loss of [[potassium]], [[calcium]], [[sodium]], and [[magnesium]]. Excessive use of furosemide will most likely lead to a [[metabolic alkalosis]] due to [[hypochloremia]] and [[hypokalemia]]. The drug should, therefore, not be used in horses that are dehydrated or experiencing kidney failure. It should be used with caution in horses with liver problems or electrolyte abnormalities. Overdose may lead to dehydration, change in drinking patterns and urination, seizures, gastrointestinal problems, kidney damage, lethargy, collapse, and coma.

Furosemide should be used with caution when combined with corticosteroids (as this increases the risk of electrolyte imbalance), aminoglycoside antibiotics (increases risk of kidney or ear damage), and trimethoprim sulfa (causes decreased platelet count). It may also cause interactions with anesthesics, so its use should be related to the veterinarian if the animal is going into surgery, and it decreases the kidneys' ability to excrete [[aspirin]], so dosages will need to be adjusted if combined with that drug.

Furosemide may increase the risk of [[digoxin]] toxicity due to hypokalemia.

The drug is best not used during pregnancy or in a lactating mare, as it has been shown to be passed through the placenta and milk in studies with other species. It should not be used in horses with [[pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction]] (Cushings).

Furosemide is detectable in urine 36–72 hours following injection. Its use is prohibited by most equestrian organizations.
