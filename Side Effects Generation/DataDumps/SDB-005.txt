'''SDB-005''' is an [[indazole]]-based [[synthetic cannabinoid]] that has been sold online as a [[designer drug]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.caymanchem.com/app/template/Product.vm/catalog/15389 | title=SDB-005 | publisher=Cayman Chemical | accessdate=27 June 2015}}</ref> It is presumed to be an agonist of the CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub> cannabinoid receptors. SDB-005 is the indazole core analogue of [[PB-22]] where the [[8-hydroxyquinoline]] has also been replaced with a [[naphthalene]] group.

The code number SDB-005 was originally used for a different compound, the N-phenyl instead of N-benzyl analogue of [[SDB-006]]. This compound is a potent [[agonist]] of the [[CB1 receptor|CB<sub>1</sub> receptor]] (Ki = 21 nM) and [[CB2 receptor|CB<sub>2</sub> receptor]] (Ki = 140 nM).<ref>{{cite journal | title=The Synthesis and Pharmacological Evaluation of Adamantane-Derived Indoles: Cannabimimetic Drugs of Abuse | journal=ABS Chemical Neuroscience |date=July 2013  | volume=4 | issue=7 | pages=1081â€“1092 | doi=10.1021/cn400035r | pmid=23551277 | pmc=3715837}}</ref>

However SDB-005 was subsequently used as the name for the indazole-3-carboxylate compound mentioned above when it was sold in Europe as a [[designer drug]], and was entered into the [[EMCDDA]] synthetic drug database under this name.<ref>[https://forum.goeg.at/EwsForum/default.aspx?g=posts&t=205 EWS_EU: Neue Psychoaktive Substanzen, April 2015]</ref> Consequently, there are now two distinct, yet fairly closely related cannabinoid compounds, which may both be referred to under the code SDB-005.
