The [[Danube|River Danube]], Europe's second-longest river, rises in [[Germany]] and flows in a general southeast direction for 2,857&nbsp;km (1775&nbsp;mi), coursing through ten countries before emptying into Romania's [[Danube Delta]].

Modern Romania was formed in 1859 through a [[United Principalities|personal union]] of the Danubian Principalities of [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]]. The new state, officially named Romania since 1866, gained independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1877. At the end of [[World War I]], [[Transylvania]], [[Bukovina]] and [[Bessarabia]] united with the sovereign [[Kingdom of Romania]]. During [[World War II]], Romania was an ally of [[Nazi Germany]] against the [[Soviet Union]], fighting side by side with the [[Wehrmacht]] until 1944, when it joined the Allied powers and faced occupation by the [[Red Army]] forces. Romania lost several territories, of which [[Northern Transylvania]] was regained after the war. Following the war, Romania became a [[Socialist state|socialist republic]] and member of the [[Warsaw Pact]]. After the [[Romanian Revolution|1989 Revolution]], Romania [[History of Romania since 1989|began a transition towards]] democracy and a capitalist [[market economy]].

Romania is a developing country and one of the poorest in the [[European Union]], ranking 50th in the [[Human Development Index]].<ref>https://www.isi-web.org/index.php/resources/developing-countries</ref><ref>https://qz.com/763630/one-of-the-poorest-countries-in-the-eu-could-be-its-next-tech-startup-hub/</ref> Following rapid economic growth in the early 2000s, Romania has an economy predominantly based on services, and is a producer and net exporter of machines and electric energy, featuring companies like [[Automobile Dacia]] and [[Petrom|OMV Petrom]]. It has been a member of [[NATO]] since 2004, and part of the [[European Union]] since 2007. A strong majority of the population identify themselves as [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christians]] and are native speakers of [[Romanian language|Romanian]], a [[Romance languages|Romance language]].

Two spelling forms: ''român'' and ''rumân'' were used interchangeably<ref group=lower-alpha>''"am scris aceste sfente cărți de învățături, să fie popilor rumânesti&nbsp;... să înțeleagă toți oamenii cine-s rumâni creștini"'' "Întrebare creștinească" (1559), Bibliografia românească veche, IV, 1944, p. 6. <br />''"...&nbsp;că văzum cum toate limbile au și înfluresc întru cuvintele slăvite a lui Dumnezeu numai noi românii pre limbă nu avem.

Roman incursions under Emperor [[Trajan]] between 101–102 AD and 105–106 AD resulted in half of the [[Dacia]]n kingdom becoming a province of the [[Roman Empire]] called "[[Roman Dacia|Dacia Felix]]".

[[File:Ceausescu, Nicolae.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] ruled Romania as its Communist leader from 1965 until 1989.]]
[[File:Romanian Revolution 1989 1.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The [[Romanian Revolution]] in 1989 was one of the few violent revolutions in Europe that brought an end to Communist rule.]]
In 1965, [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] came to power and started to conduct the foreign policy more independently from the Soviet Union. Thus, Communist Romania was the only [[Warsaw Pact]] country who refused to participate at the Soviet-led [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|1968 invasion]] of [[Czechoslovakia]] (Ceaușescu even publicly condemned the action as "a big mistake, [and] a serious danger to peace in Europe and to the fate of Communism in the world"<ref>{{cite AV media|language=Romanian|url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/political-tension/query/nicolae|title=Political Tension 1968|publisher=British Pathé|date=21 August 1968|location=Bucharest}}</ref>); it was also the only Communist state to maintain diplomatic relations with [[Israel]] after 1967's [[Six-Day War]]; and established diplomatic relations with [[West Germany]] the same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/romania/75.htm |publisher=Country Studies.us|title=Romania: Soviet Union and Eastern Europe|accessdate=31 August 2008}}</ref> At the same time, close ties with the [[Arab]] countries (and the [[PLO]]) allowed Romania to play a key role in the Israel–[[Egypt]] and Israel–PLO peace talks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/romania/80.htm |publisher=Country Studies.us| title=Middle East policies in Communist Romania|accessdate=31 August 2008}}</ref>

The latter eventually initiated a policy of total reimbursement of the foreign debt by imposing [[1980s austerity policy in Romania|austerity steps]] that impoverished the population and exhausted the economy. The process succeeded in repaying all foreign government debt of Romania in 1989. At the same time, Ceaușescu greatly extended the authority of the Securitate secret police and imposed a severe [[Nicolae Ceaușescu's cult of personality|cult of personality]], which led to a dramatic decrease in the dictator's popularity and culminated in his overthrow and eventual execution, together with his wife, in the violent [[Romanian Revolution]] of December 1989 in which thousands were killed or injured. The charges for which they were executed were, among others, genocide by starvation.

===Contemporary period===
{{Main|History of Romania since 1989}}
After the 1989 revolution, the [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] (NSF), led by [[Ion Iliescu]], took partial multi-party democratic and free market measures.<ref>{{cite web |last=Carothers |first=Thomas |title=Romania: The Political Background |url= http://www.idea.int/publications/country/upload/Romania,%20The%20Political%20Background.pdf |format=PDF |quote="This seven-year period can be characterized as a gradualistic, often ambiguous transition away from communist rule towards democracy." |accessdate=31 August 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hellman |first=Joel |title=Winners Take All: The Politics of Partial Reform in Postcommunist |journal=Transitions World Politics |volume=50 |issue=2 |date=January 1998 |pages=203–234}}</ref> In April 1990, a sit-in protest contesting the results of the elections and accusing the NSF, including Iliescu, of being made up of former Communists and members of the Securitate — rapidly grew to become what was called the [[Golaniad]].

The subsequent disintegration of the Front produced several political parties, including the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]] and the [[Democratic Party (Romania)|Democratic Party]]. The former governed Romania from 1990 until 1996 through several coalitions and governments with Ion Iliescu as head of state. Since then, there have been several other democratic changes of government: in 1996 [[Emil Constantinescu]] was elected president, in 2000 Iliescu returned to power, while [[Traian Băsescu]] was elected in 2004 and was narrowly re-elected in 2009.<ref>[http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-international-6689374-presa-internationala-despre-alegerile-din-romania-traian-basescu-castigat-limita-romanii-mici-sperante-dezghete-ajutorul-fmi.htm Presa internationala despre alegerile din Romania: Traian Basescu a castigat la limita; Romanii au mici sperante sa se dezghete ajutorul de la FMI – International].

The post-1989 period is also characterized by the fact that most of the former industrial and economic enterprises which were built and operated during the Communist period have been closed, mainly as a result of the policies of privatization of the post-1989 regimes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rtsa.ro/tras/index.php/tras/article/download/97/93 |title= DEINDUSTRIALIZATION AND URBAN SHRINKAGE IN ROMANIA.

Post-1989 regimes are also criticized for allowing foreign exploitations of mineral, rare metals and gold reserves at Rosia Montana,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://business.financialpost.com/news/mining/romania-shuts-door-on-gabriels-giant-rosia-montana-gold-mine|title=Romania shuts door on Gabriel's giant Rosia Montana gold mine|work=Financial Post|access-date=2 May 2017}}</ref> as well as for permitting American multinational energy giant Chevron to prospect for shale gas using the hydraulic fracking technique which has been claimed to pollute the vast underground freshwater reserves in the affected areas. Both these actions have led to significant protests by the population in 2012–2014.

{{Politics and Government of Romania}}
The [[Constitution of Romania]] is based on the [[Constitution of France]]'s Fifth Republic and was approved in a national referendum on 8 December 1991, and amended in October 2003 to bring it into conformity with the EU legislation. The country is governed on the basis of a multi-party democratic system and the separation of powers between the legislative, executive and judicial branches. It is a [[semi-presidential]] republic where executive functions are held by both [[Government of Romania|government]] and the [[President of Romania|president]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Tony|last=Verheijen |url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/oso/public/content/politicalscience/9780198293866/acprof-9780198293866-chapter-10.html |title=Oxford Scholarship Online: Semi-Presidentialism in Europe |publisher=Oxfordscholarship.com |date=14 March 1990 |accessdate=29 August 2011}}</ref> The latter is elected by popular vote for a maximum of two terms of five years and appoints the prime minister, who in turn appoints the [[Romanian Cabinet|Council of Ministers]]. The legislative branch of the government, collectively known as the [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] (residing at the [[Palace of the Parliament]]), consists of [[Bicameralism|two chambers]] ([[Senate of Romania|Senate]] and [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber of Deputies]]) whose members are elected every four years by [[Plurality voting system|simple plurality]].<ref name="Europaworld" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antena3.ro/politica/se-schimba-sistemul-de-vot-deputatii-au-adoptat-noua-lege-electorala-propusa-de-usl-168053.html |title=Se schimbă sistemul de vot.
