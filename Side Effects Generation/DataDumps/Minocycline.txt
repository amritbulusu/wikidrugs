'''Minocycline''' is a [[broad-spectrum antibiotic|broad-spectrum]] [[tetracycline antibiotics|tetracycline antibiotic]], and has a broader spectrum than the other members of the group. It is a [[bacteriostatic]] antibiotic, classified as a long-acting type. As a result of its long half-life it generally has [[blood plasma|serum]] levels 2–4 times that of the simple water-soluble tetracyclines.

Minocycline is the most lipid-soluble of the tetracycline-class antibiotics, giving it the greatest penetration into the prostate and brain, but also the greatest amount of [[central nervous system]] (CNS)-related side effects, such as [[vertigo]]. A common side effect is [[diarrhea]]. Uncommon side effects (with prolonged therapy) include skin discolouration and [[autoimmune disorder]]s that are not seen with other drugs in the class.

Minocycline is a relatively poor tetracycline-class antibiotic choice for urinary pathogens sensitive to this antibiotic class, as its solubility in water and levels in the urine are less than all other tetracyclines. Minocycline is metabolized by the liver and has poor urinary excretion.

Also, more so than other tetracyclines, minocycline can cause the rare condition of [[idiopathic intra-cranial hypertension|secondary intracranial hypertension]] which has initial symptoms of headache, visual disturbances, dizziness, vomiting, and confusion.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} [[Cerebral edema|Brain swelling]], as well as autoimmune [[rheumatoid arthritis]] are rare side effects to minocycline in some people.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Minocycline-induced hypersensitivity syndrome presenting with meningitis and brain edema: a case report|author=Lefebvre N|journal=Journal of Medical Case Reports|year=2007|volume=1|pages=22|doi= 10.1186/1752-1947-1-22|pmid=17511865|pmc=1884162|name-list-format=vanc|author2=Forestier E|author3=Farhi D|display-authors=3|last4=Mahsa|first4=Mohseni|last5=Remy|first5=Véronique|last6=Lesens|first6=Olivier|last7=Christmann|first7=Daniel|last8=Hansmann|first8=Yves}}</ref>

Minocycline's absorption is impaired if taken at the same time of day as calcium or iron supplements. Unlike some of the other tetracycline group antibiotics, it can be taken with calcium-rich foods such as milk, although this does reduce the absorption slightly.<ref>{{cite book |title=Drug Interactions in Infectious Diseases |last=Piscitelli |first=Stephen C. |author2=Keith Rodvold |year=2005 |publisher=Humana Press |isbn=1-58829-455-2 }}</ref>

Minocycline, like other tetracyclines, is associated with esophageal irritation and ulceration if insufficient fluids are taken with the drug before sleep. <ref>Drugs.com [https://www.drugs.com/disease-interactions/minocycline.html#Esophageal_Irritation 'Minocycline Disease Interactions'].

A study published in 2007, suggested that minocycline harms [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]] patients. Patients on minocycline declined more rapidly than those on placebo. The mechanism of this side effect is unknown, although a hypothesis is that the drug exacerbated an autoimmune component of the primary disease. According to the researcher from Columbia University the effect does not seem to be dose-dependent because the patients on high doses did not do worse than those on the low doses.<ref>Science Vol 318, 1227, 2007</ref>

==Side effects==
Minocycline may cause [[Abdominal pain|upset stomach]], [[diarrhea]], [[dizziness]], unsteadiness, [[somnolence|drowsiness]], [[mouth sores]], [[headache]] and [[vomiting]]. Minocycline increases [[photophobia|sensitivity to sunlight]].

Occasionally minocycline therapy may result in autoimmune disorders such as drug related [[lupus]] and auto-immune hepatitis; minocycline induced auto-immune hepatitis when it occurs usually occurs in men who also developed minocycline induced lupus, however, women are the most likely to develop minocycline induced lupus. Significant or complete recovery occurs in most people who develop minocycline induced autoimmune problems within a period of a couple of weeks to a year of cessation of minocycline therapy.

Minocycline, but not other tetracyclines, can cause ''vestibular disturbances'' with [[dizziness]], [[ataxia]], [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]] and [[tinnitus]]. These effects are again thought to be related to minocycline's greater penetration into the central nervous system. Vestibular side effects are much more common in women than in men, occurring in 50% to 70% of women receiving minocycline. As a result of the frequency of this bothersome side effect, minocycline is rarely used in female patients.<ref>{{cite book

==Anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective==
In various models of neurodegenerative disease, minocycline has demonstrated neurorestorative as well as [[neuroprotective]] properties. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease and [[Parkinson's disease]] have shown a particularly beneficial response to minocycline in research studies, and an antipsychotic benefit has been found in people with [[schizophrenia]] and minocycline is proposed as a possible addon therapy for some schizophrenics.<ref name="pmid18991666">{{cite journal |author=Miyaoka T |title=Clinical potential of minocycline for schizophrenia |journal=CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=376–81 |date=October 2008 |pmid=18991666 |doi=10.2174/187152708786441858 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Levkovitz | first1 = Y. | last2 = Mendlovich | first2 = S. | last3 = Riwkes | first3 = S. | last4 = Braw | first4 = Y. | last5 = Levkovitch-Verbin | first5 = H. | last6 = Gal | first6 = G. | last7 = Fennig | first7 = S. | last8 = Treves | first8 = I. | last9 = Kron | first9 = S. | doi = 10.4088/JCP.08m04666yel | title = A Double-Blind, Randomized Study of Minocycline for the Treatment of Negative and Cognitive Symptoms in Early-Phase Schizophrenia | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 71 | issue = 2 | pages = 138–149 | year = 2010 | pmid =  19895780| pmc = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Chaudhry | first1 = I.

As an anti-inflammatory, minocycline inhibits [[apoptotic|apoptosis]] (cell death) via attenuation of [[TNF-alpha]], downregulating pro-inflammatory [[cytokine]] output. This effect is mediated by a direct action of minocycline on the activated [[T cells]] and on [[microglia]], which results in the decreased ability of T cells to contact microglia which impairs cytokine production in T cell-microglia [[signal transduction]] .<!--

Minocycline also inhibits microglial activation, through blockade of [[NF-κB|NF-kappa B]] nuclear translocation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

A 2007 study reported the impact of the antibiotic minocycline on clinical and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) outcomes and serum immune molecules in 40 MS patients over 24 months of open-label minocycline treatment. Despite a moderately high pretreatment relapse rate in the patient group prior to treatment (1.3/year pre-enrollment; 1.2/year during a three-month baseline period), no relapses occurred between months 6 and 24 on minocycline. Also, despite significant MRI disease-activity pretreatment (19/40 scans had gadolinium-enhancing activity during a three-month run-in), the only patient with [[MRI contrast agent|gadolinium-enhancing]] lesions on MRI at 12 and 24 months was on half-dose minocycline. Levels of [[interleukin-12]] (IL-12), which at high levels might antagonize the proinflammatory IL-12 receptor, were elevated over 18 months of treatment, as were levels of soluble [[Blood vessel|vascular]] [[cell adhesion molecule|cell adhesion molecule-1]] ([[VCAM-1]]). The activity of [[matrix metalloproteinase|matrix metalloproteinase-9]] was decreased by treatment. Clinical and MRI outcomes in this study were supported by systemic immunological changes and call for further investigation of minocycline in MS.<!--
