'''Carfilzomib''' (marketed under the trade name '''Kyprolis''', developed by [[Onyx Pharmaceuticals]]) is an anti-cancer drug acting as a selective [[proteasome inhibitor]]. Chemically, it is a [[tetrapeptide]] [[Epoxide|epoxy]]ketone and an [[Structural analog|analog]] of [[epoxomicin]].<ref name=dd>[http://www.cancer.gov/drugdictionary/?CdrID=459751 Carfilzomib], NCI Drug Dictionary</ref>

The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved it on 20 July 2012 for use in patients with [[multiple myeloma]] who have received at least two prior therapies, including treatment with [[bortezomib]] and an immunomodulatory therapy (such as [[lenalidomide]]) and have demonstrated disease progression on or within 60 days of completion of the last therapy. Approval is based on response rate. Clinical benefit, such as improvement in survival or symptoms, has not been verified.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm312920.htm|title=FDA Approves Kyprolis for Some Patients with Multiple Myeloma|publisher=FDA|date=2012-07-20|accessdate=2013-07-23}}</ref>

The abbreviation '''CFZ''' is common for referring to carfilzomib, but abbreviating drug names is not [[best practice]] in medicine.

==History==
Carfilzomib is derived from [[epoxomicin]], a natural product that was shown by the laboratory of [[Craig M. Crews|Craig Crews]] at [[Yale University]] to inhibit the proteasome.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Meng|first=L|author2=Mohan, R.|author3=Kwok, B.H.|author4=Elofsson, M.|author5=Sin, N.|author6=Crews, C.M.|title=Epoxomicin, a potent and selective proteasome inhibitor, exhibits in vivo antiinflammatory activity|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|year=1999|volume=96|issue=18|pages=10403–8|pmid=10468620|doi=10.1073/pnas.96.18.10403|pmc=17900}}</ref> The Crews laboratory subsequently invented a more specific derivative of epoxomicin named YU101,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Myung|first=J|author2=Kim, K.B.|author3=Lindsten, K.|author4=Dantuma, N.P.|author5=Crews, C.M.|title=Lack of proteasome active site allostery as revealed by subunit-specific inhibitors|journal=Mol Cell|year=2001|volume=7|issue=2|pages=411–20|pmid=11239469|doi=10.1016/S1097-2765(01)00188-5}}</ref> which was licensed to [[Proteolix, Inc.]]  Scientists at Proteolix invented a new, distinct compound that had potential use as a drug in humans, known as carfilzomib. Proteolix advanced carfilzomib to multiple Phase 1 and 2 [[clinical trials]], including a pivotal [[phase 2 clinical trial]] designed to seek [[accelerated approval]].<ref name=DC>{{cite news|url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/90/i35/Carfilzomib-Discovery-Drug.html|title=Carfilzomib: From Discovery To Drug|publisher=Chemical & Engineering News|date=2012-08-27 |accessdate=2013-07-30}}</ref> Clinical trials for carfilzomib continue under [[Onyx Pharmaceuticals]], which acquired Proteolix in 2009.<ref name=DC/>

In January 2011, the FDA granted carfilzomib [[Fast track (FDA)|fast-track status]], allowing Onyx to initiate a rolling submission of its new drug application for carfilzomib.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2011/01/31/onyx-multiple-myeloma-drug-wins.html|title=Onyx multiple myeloma drug wins FDA fast-track status|publisher=San Francisco Business Times|date=2011-01-31|accessdate=2011-09-01}}</ref> In December 2011, the FDA granted Onyx standard review designation,<ref name=dd1>{{cite web|url= http://www.myelomabeacon.com/news/2011/12/11/beacon-breaking-news-carfilzomib-to-get-standard-not-priority-fda-review/ | title=Beacon Breaking News – Carfilzomib to Get Standard, Not Priority, FDA Review | publisher=The Myeloma Beacon  | accessdate=2012-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/forconsumers/byaudience/forpatientadvocates/speedingaccesstoimportantnewtherapies/ucm128291.htm#compare | title= Fast Track, Accelerated Approval and Priority Review; Accelerating Availability of New Drugs for Patients with Serious Diseases | publisher=FDA | accessdate=2012-02-27}}</ref> for its new drug application submission based on the 003-A1 study, an open-label, single-arm phase 2b trial. The trial evaluated 266 heavily-pretreated patients with relapsed and refractory multiple [[myeloma]] who had received at least two prior therapies, including bortezomib and either thalidomide or [[lenalidomide]].<ref name="ASCO 2011; Abstract 8027">{{cite web|url= http://www.asco.org/ASCOv2/Meetings/Abstracts?&vmview=abst_detail_view&confID=102&abstractID=81812|title=PX-171-003-A1, an open-label, single-arm, phase (Ph) II study of carfilzomib (CFZ) in patients (pts) with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (R/R MM): Long-term follow-up and subgroup analysis|publisher= ASCO 2011; Abstract 8027|year=2011|accessdate=2011-09-01}}</ref> It costs approximately $10,000 per 28-day cycle.<ref>{{cite web|title=FDA Approves Kyprolis (Carfilzomib) For Relapsed And Refractory Multiple Myeloma | url=http://www.myelomabeacon.com/news/2012/07/20/fda-approves-kyprolis-carfilzomib-for-relapsed-and-refractory-multiple-myeloma/ | publisher=The Myeloma Beacon | accessdate=2012-07-20}}</ref>

==Mechanism==
Carfilzomib irreversibly binds to and inhibits the [[chymotrypsin]]-like activity of the [[20S proteasome]], an enzyme that degrades unwanted cellular proteins. Inhibition of proteasome-mediated proteolysis results in a build-up of polyubiquinated proteins, which may cause cell cycle arrest, [[apoptosis]], and inhibition of tumor growth.<ref name=dd/>

==Clinical trials==

===Completed===
A single-arm, Phase II trial (003-A1) of carfilzomib in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma showed that single-agent carfilzomib demonstrated a clinical benefit rate of 36% in the 266 patients evaluated and had an overall response rate of 22.9% and median duration of response of 7.8 months. The FDA approval of carfilzomib was based on results of the 003-A1 trial.<ref name=dd2>{{cite news|url= http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=ea66eb30-e665-4693-99a1-a9d3b4bbe2d6|title=Carfilzomib Prescribing Information|publisher=NCI Drug Dictionary|accessdate=2013-07-23}}</ref>

In a Phase II trial (004), carfilzomib had a 53% overall response rate among patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma who had not previously received bortezomib. This study also included a bortezomib-treated cohort. Results were reported separately.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vij|first=R|title=An open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study of single-agent carfilzomib in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma who have been previously treated with bortezomib|journal=Br J Haematol|year=2012|volume=158|issue=6|pages=739–748|pmid=22845873|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2141.2012.09232.x}}</ref> This study also found prolonged carfilzomib treatment was tolerable, with approximately 22% of patients continuing treatment beyond one year. The 004 trial was a smaller study originally designed to investigate the impact of carfilzomib treatment in relationship to bortezomib treatment in less heavily pretreated (1–3 prior regimens) patients.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vij|first=R|title=An open-label, single-arm, phase ii (PX-171-004) study of single-agent carfilzomib in bortezomib-naive patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma.|journal=Blood|year=2012|volume=119|issue=24|pages=5661–70|pmid=22555973|doi=10.1182/blood-2012-03-414359|pmc=4123327}}</ref>

A Phase II trial (005), which assessed the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and efﬁcacy of carﬁlzomib, in patients with multiple myeloma and varying degrees of renal impairment, where nearly 50% of patients were refractory to both bortezomib and lenalidomide, demonstrated that pharmacokinetics and safety were not influenced by the degree of baseline renal impairment. Carﬁlzomib was tolerable and demonstrated efficacy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Badros|first=AZ|title=Carfilzomib in multiple myeloma patients with renal impairment: pharmacokinetics and safety.|journal=Leukemia|year=2013|pmid=23364621|doi=10.1038/leu.2013.29|volume=27|issue=8|pages=1707–14|pmc=3740399}}</ref>

In a frontline Phase I/II study, the combination of carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and low-dose dexamethasone was highly active and well tolerated, permitting the use of full doses for an extended time in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients, with limited need for dose modification. Responses were rapid and improved over time, reaching 100% very good partial response.<ref name=ASH2011>{{cite web|url=http://ash.confex.com/ash/2011/webprogram/Paper39029.html | title=Final Results of a Frontline Phase 1/2 Study of Carfilzomib Lenalidomide, and Low-Dose Dexamethasone (CRd) in Multiple Myeloma (MM) | publisher=ASH 20111; Abstract 631 | accessdate=2012-02-27}}</ref>
