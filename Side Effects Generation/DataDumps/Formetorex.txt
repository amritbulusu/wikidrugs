'''Formetorex''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]), also known as '''formetamide''' or '''''N''-formylamphetamine''', is an [[substituted amphetamine|amphetamine]] described as an [[anorectic]] which does not appear to have ever been marketed.<ref name="GanellinTriggle1996">{{cite book|author1=C.R. Ganellin|author2=David J. Triggle|title=Dictionary of Pharmacological Agents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_mfTTIApVEC&pg=PA568|date=21 November 1996|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-412-46630-4|pages=568–}}</ref>

Formetorex is also an [[chemical intermediate|intermediate]] in the production of [[amphetamine]] by the "[[Leuckart reaction]]."<ref name="Amph Synth">{{cite book | url = http://www.unodc.org/pdf/scientific/stnar34.pdf | title = Recommended methods of the identification and analysis of amphetamine, methamphetamine, and their ring-substituted analogues in seized materials | accessdate = 14 October 2013 |year = 2006 | author = Laboratory and Scientific Section | publisher = United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime Vienna |location = New York | isbn = 92-1-148208-9}}</ref> It is also commonly found as an impurity in clandestine labs where this synthesis method is used.<ref name="Amph Synth" /><ref>{{cite journal|last=Kram|first=TC|title=Reidentification of a major impurity in illicit amphetamine.|journal=Journal of forensic sciences|date=July 1979|volume=24|issue=3|pages=596–9|pmid=541629}}</ref> Due to the simplicity of the Leuckart reaction, it is the most popular synthetic route employed for the illicit manufacture of amphetamines.<ref name="Amph Synth" />  The synthesis involves a non-metal reduction that is typically carried out in three steps.<ref name="Amph Synth" />  For amphetamine synthesis, a mixture of [[phenylacetone]] and [[formamide]] (sometimes in the presence of [[formic acid]]) or [[ammonium formate]], is heated until a condensation reaction results in the intermediate product, formetamide.<ref name="Amph Synth" /> In the second step, formetamide is hydrolysed using hydrochloric acid, and the reaction mixture is then basified, isolated, and steam distilled to produce the free base.<ref name="Amph Synth" />  The final step, the product is dissolved in an organic solvent and precipitated as the sulphate salt of amphetamine by adding sulfuric acid.<ref name="Amph Synth" />
