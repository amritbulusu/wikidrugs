'''Alphacetylmethadol''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]), or '''α-acetylmethadol''' ('''AAM'''), is a [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] [[opioid]] [[analgesic]].<ref name="pmid12373424">{{cite journal |vauthors=Newman JL, Vann RE, May EL, Beardsley PM | title = Heroin discriminative stimulus effects of methadone, LAAM and other isomers of acetylmethadol in rats | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 164 | issue = 1 | pages = 108–14 |date=October 2002 | pmid = 12373424 | doi = 10.1007/s00213-002-1198-8 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00213-002-1198-8}}</ref> Its [[levorotary]] [[enantiomer]], [[levacetylmethadol]], is an FDA-approved treatment for opioid addiction.<ref name="pmid12373424" /> Alphacetylmethadol is very similar in structure to [[methadone]], a widely prescribed treatment for opioid addiction. In the [[United States]], it is a [[List of Schedule I drugs (US)|Schedule I controlled substance]] under the [[Controlled Substances Act]] (presumably because it was never marketed in the US, as is the case with other common opiate/opioid medications such as [[diacetylmorphine]] and [[alphaprodine]]), with an ACSCN of 9603 and a 2013 annual manufacturing quota of 2 grammes.<ref>{{uscsub|21|812|b|1}}</ref>
