It is important to clarify that the term ''cyproterone'' is often used as a synonym for ''cyproterone acetate'', and when the term occurs, what is usually being referred to is, confusingly, CPA and not actually cyproterone.

==Pharmacology==

===Antiandrogen===
Like CPA, cyproterone is a potent antiandrogen.<ref name="MoltzRömmler1978">{{cite journal|last1=Moltz|first1=L.|last2=Römmler|first2=A.|last3=Schwartz|first3=U.|last4=Hammerstein|first4=J.|title=Effects of Cyproterone Acetate (CPA) on Pituitary Gonadotrophin Release and on Androgen Secretion Before and After LH-RH Double Stimulation Tests in Men|journal=International Journal of Andrology|volume=1|issue=s2b|year=1978|pages=713–719|issn=0105-6263|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2605.1978.tb00518.x|quote=[...] Hammerstein 1977).

Cyproterone acetate has three times the anti-androgenic potency of cyproterone, and also has some progestational properties (for review, see Neumann et al., 1970). [...] Cyproterone seemed to decrease the activity of 17α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and of 5α-steroid reductase in human prostate in vitro, as it does in testes and liver of rats (Breuer & Hoffmann, 1967; Hoffmann & Breuer, 1968; Denef et al., 1968).

[...] The pure anti-androgens, such as cyproteron, block the receptors of the negative feedback system. An uninhibited secretion of the releasing factors and an increased production of gonadotropins results, so that the inhibitory effect on the endorgans may finally be overcome by overpoduction of testosterone (Neumann, 1971). Cyproterone acetate, however, with its marked progestational effect, inhibits the release of LH and FSH at the same time and thus has a lasting anti-androgenic effect (Neumann, 1970). Thus, cyproteron leads to an increase in LH, whereas cyproteron acetate inhibits both LH and FSH.}}</ref> As such, it is not an antigonadotropin, and is actually [[progonadotropic]] in males, increasing [[gonadotropin]] and [[testosterone]] levels due to inhibition of AR-mediated [[negative feedback]] on the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis]].<ref name="MoltzRömmler1978" /><ref name="Labhart2012" /><ref name="pmid5091295">{{cite journal | vauthors = Steinbeck H, Mehring M, Neumann F | title = Comparison of the effects of cyproterone, cyproterone acetate and oestradiol on testicular function, accessory sexual glands and fertility in a long-term study on rats | journal = J.
