<!-- Side effects -->
The side effects of opioids may include [[itchiness]], [[sedation]], [[nausea]], [[respiratory depression]], [[constipation]], and [[euphoria]]. [[Opioid dependence|Tolerance and dependence]] will develop with continuous use, requiring increasing doses and leading to a [[Opioid dependence#Symptoms of withdrawal|withdrawal syndrome]] upon abrupt discontinuation. The euphoria attracts recreational use, and frequent, escalating recreational use of opioids typically results in addiction. An [[Drug overdose|overdose]] or concurrent use with other [[Depressant|depressant drugs]] commonly results in death from respiratory depression.<ref>{{cite web|title=FDA requires strong warnings for opioid analgesics, prescription opioid cough products, and benzodiazepine labeling related to serious risks and death from combined use|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm518697.htm|website=FDA|accessdate=1 September 2016|date=August 31, 2016}}</ref>

<!-- Mechanism -->
Opioids act by binding to [[opioid receptor]]s, which are found principally in the [[Central nervous system|central]] and [[peripheral nervous system]] and the [[gastrointestinal tract]]. These receptors mediate both the [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] and the somatic effects of opioids. Opioid drugs include [[Agonist|partial agonists]], like the anti-diarrhea drug [[loperamide]] and [[Receptor antagonist|antagonists]] like [[naloxegol]] for opioid-induced constipation, which do not cross the [[blood-brain barrier]], but can displace other opioids from binding in those receptors.

<!-- History, society and culture -->
Because of opioid drugs' reputation for addiction and fatal overdose, most are [[controlled substance]]s.

In cases of diarrhea-predominate [[irritable bowel syndrome]], opioids may be used to suppress diarrhea. [[Loperamide]] is a [[peripherally selective]] opioid available [[Over-the-counter drug|without a prescription]] used to suppress diarrhea.

The ability to suppress diarrhea also produces constipation when opioids are used beyond several weeks.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Opioid-Induced Constipation|journal = Pain Medicine (Malden, Mass.)|date = 2015-10-01|issn = 1526-4637|pmid = 26461071|pages = S16–21|volume = 16 Suppl 1|doi = 10.1111/pme.12911|first = Lynn R.|last = Webster}}</ref> [[Naloxegol]], a peripherally-selective opioid antagonist is now available to treat opioid induced constipation.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Press Announcements - FDA approves Movantik for opioid-induced constipation|url = http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm414620.htm|website = www.fda.gov|access-date = 2016-02-18|language = en}}</ref>

Carefully [[Dose titration|titrating]] the dose of opioids can provide for effective pain relief while minimizing adverse effects. Morphine and diamorphine have been shown to have a wider therapeutic range or "safety margin" than some other opioids. Because the [[effective dose (pharmacology)|effective quantity]] varies and cannot be predicted, dose titration usually starts at low amounts, increasing until the desired or adverse effect occurs.<ref name=oxford/>

====Tolerance====
[[Drug tolerance|Tolerance]] is a process characterized by [[neural adaptation|neuroadaptations]] that result in reduced drug effects. While [[Downregulation and upregulation|receptor upregulation]] may often play an important role other mechanisms are also known.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Pradhan| year = 2010 | title = Ligand-directed trafficking of the δ-opioid receptor in vivo: two paths toward analgesic tolerance.| journal = J Neurosci | volume = 30 | issue = 49| pages = 16459–68 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3748-10.2010 | pmid = 21147985 |display-authors=etal | pmc=3086517}}</ref> Tolerance is more pronounced for some effects than for others; tolerance occurs slowly to the effects on mood, itching, urinary retention, and respiratory depression, but occurs more quickly to the analgesia and other physical side effects. However, tolerance does not develop to constipation or [[miosis]] (the constriction of the pupil of the eye to less than or equal to two millimeters). This idea has been challenged, however, with some authors arguing that tolerance ''does'' develop to miosis.<ref name="pmid15731628">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kollars JP, Larson MD | title = Tolerance to miotic effects of opioids | journal = Anesthesiology | volume = 102 | issue = 3 | page = 701 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15731628 | doi = 10.1097/00000542-200503000-00047 }}</ref>

Tolerance is a physiologic process where the body adjusts to a medication that is frequently present, usually requiring higher doses of the same medication over time to achieve the same effect. It is a common occurrence in individuals taking high doses of opioids for extended periods, but does not predict any relationship to misuse or addiction.

====Physical dependence====
[[Substance dependence|Physical dependence]] is the physiological adaptation of the body to the presence of a substance, in this case opioid medication. It is defined by the development of withdrawal symptoms when the substance is discontinued, when the dose is reduced abruptly or, specifically in the case of opioids, when an antagonist (''e.g.'', [[naloxone]]) or an agonist-antagonist (''e.g.'', [[pentazocine]]) is administered. Physical dependence is a normal and expected aspect of certain medications and does not necessarily imply that the patient is addicted.

The withdrawal symptoms for opiates may include severe [[dysphoria]], craving for another opiate dose, irritability, [[sweating]], [[nausea]], [[rhinorrea]], [[tremor]], vomiting and [[myalgia]]. Slowly reducing the intake of opioids over days and weeks can reduce or eliminate the withdrawal symptoms.<ref name=oxford/> The speed and severity of withdrawal depends on the half-life of the opioid; heroin and morphine withdrawal occur more quickly and are more severe than [[methadone]] withdrawal. The acute withdrawal phase is often followed by a protracted phase of depression and insomnia that can last for months. The symptoms of opioid withdrawal can be treated with other medications, such as [[clonidine]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hermann D, Klages E, Welzel H, Mann K, Croissant B | title = Low efficacy of non-opioid drugs in opioid withdrawal symptoms | journal = Addict Biol | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 165–9 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 16191669 | doi = 10.1080/13556210500123514 }}</ref> Physical dependence does not predict drug misuse or true addiction, and is closely related to the same mechanism as tolerance. While there is anecdotal claims of benefit with [[ibogaine]], data to support its use in substance dependence is poor.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=TK|title=Ibogaine in the treatment of substance dependence.|journal=Current drug abuse reviews|date=March 2013|volume=6|issue=1|pages=3–16|pmid=23627782|doi=10.2174/15672050113109990001}}</ref>

====Addiction====
[[Drug addiction]] is a complex set of behaviors typically associated with misuse of certain drugs, developing over time and with higher drug dosages. Addiction includes psychological compulsion, to the extent that the sufferer persists in actions leading to dangerous or unhealthy outcomes. Opioid addiction includes [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflation]] or injection, rather than taking opioids orally as prescribed for medical reasons.<ref name=oxford/>

In European nations such as Austria, Bulgaria, and Slovakia, slow release oral morphine formulations are used in opiate substitution therapy (OST) for patients who do not well tolerate the side effects of buprenorphine or [[methadone]]. In other European countries including the UK, this is also legally used for OST although on a varying scale of acceptance.

Tamper-release formulations of time-controlled preparations of medications are intended to curb abuse and addiction rates while trying to still provide legitimate pain relief and ease of use to pain patients. Questions remain, however, about the efficacy and safety of these types of preparations. Further tamper resistant medications are currently under consideration with trials for market approval by the FDA.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bannwarth B | title = Will abuse deterrent formulations of opioid analgesics be successful in their purpose? | journal = Drugs | volume = 72 | issue = 12 | pages = 1713–1723 | date = 10 September 2012 | doi = 10.2165/11635860-000000000-00000 | pmid = 22931520 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Schneider JP, Matthews M, Jamison RN | title = Abuse-deterrent and tamper-resistant opioid formulations: what is their role in addressing prescription opioid abuse? | journal = CNS Drugs | volume =  24| issue = 80 | pages = 805–810 | date = 24 Oct 2010 | doi = 10.2165/11584260-000000000-00000 | pmid = 20839893 }}</ref>

The amount of evidence available only permits making a weak conclusion, but it suggests that a physician properly managing opioid use in patients with no history of [[substance dependence]] or [[substance abuse]] can give long-term pain relief with little risk of developing addiction, abuse, or other serious side effects.<ref name="Long-term opioid management"/>

===Nausea and vomiting===
Tolerance to [[nausea]] occurs within 7–10 days, during which antiemetics (''e.g.'' low dose [[haloperidol]] once at night) are very effective.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Due to severe side effects such as tardive dyskinesia, haloperidol is now rarely used. A related drug, [[prochlorperazine]] is more often used, although it has similar risks. Stronger antiemetics such as [[ondansetron]] or [[tropisetron]] are sometimes used when nausea is severe or continuous and disturbing, despite their greater cost. A less expensive alternative is dopamine antagonists such as domperidone and metoclopramide. [[Domperidone]] does not cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] and produce adverse central antidopaminergic effects, but blocks opioid emetic action in the [[chemoreceptor trigger zone]]. (The drug is not available in the U.S.) Some antihistamines with anticholinergic properties (''e.g.'' orphenadrine or diphenhydramine) may also be effective.

Vomiting is due to [[Gastroparesis|gastric stasis]] (large volume vomiting, brief nausea relieved by vomiting, oesophageal reflux, epigastric fullness, early satiation), besides direct action on the [[chemoreceptor trigger zone]] of the [[area postrema]], the vomiting centre of the brain. Vomiting can thus be prevented by prokinetic agents (''e.g.'' [[domperidone]] or [[metoclopramide]]). If vomiting has already started, these drugs need to be administered by a non-oral route (''e.g.'' subcutaneous for metoclopramide, rectally for domperidone).
* Prokinetic agents (''e.g.'' [[domperidone]])
* Anti-cholinergic agents (''e.g.'' [[orphenadrine]])

===Drowsiness===
Tolerance to [[drowsiness]] usually develops over 5–7 days, but if troublesome, switching to an alternative opioid often helps. Certain opioids such as [[fentanyl]], [[morphine]] and [[diamorphine]] (heroin) tend to be particularly sedating, while others such as [[oxycodone]], [[tilidine]] and [[meperidine]] (pethidine) tend to produce comparatively less sedation, but individual patients responses can vary markedly and some degree of trial and error may be needed to find the most suitable drug for a particular patient. Otherwise, treatment with [[Central Nervous System|CNS]] [[stimulants]] is generally effective.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reissig|first=James E.|last2=Rybarczyk|first2=Amy M.|date=2005|title=Pharmacologic treatment of opioid-induced sedation in chronic pain|journal=The Annals of Pharmacotherapy|volume=39|issue=4|pages=727–731|doi=10.1345/aph.1E309|issn=1060-0280|pmid=15755795}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Corey|first=P.

* Stimulants (''e.g.'' [[caffeine]], [[modafinil]], [[amphetamine]], [[methylphenidate]])

===Itching===
[[Itching]] tends not to be a severe problem when opioids are used for pain relief, but [[antihistamines]] are useful for counteracting itching when it occurs. Non-sedating antihistamines such as fexofenadine are often preferred as they avoid increasing opioid induced drowsiness. However, some sedating antihistamines such as [[orphenadrine]] can produce a synergistic pain relieving effect permitting smaller doses of opioids be used. Consequently, several opioid/antihistamine combination products have been marketed, such as ''Meprozine'' ([[meperidine]]/[[promethazine]]) and ''Diconal'' ([[dipipanone]]/[[cyclizine]]), and these may also reduce opioid induced nausea.

===Respiratory depression===
[[Respiratory depression]] is the most serious adverse reaction associated with opioid use, but it usually is seen with the use of a single, intravenous dose in an opioid-naïve patient.  In patients taking opioids regularly for pain relief, tolerance to respiratory depression occurs rapidly, so that it is not a clinical problem. Several drugs have been developed which can partially block respiratory depression, although the only respiratory stimulant currently approved for this purpose is [[doxapram]], which has only limited efficacy in this application.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Yost CS | title = A new look at the respiratory stimulant doxapram | journal = CNS Drug Rev | volume = 12 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 236–49 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17227289 | doi = 10.1111/j.1527-3458.2006.00236.x | url =  }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Tan ZM, Liu JH, Dong T, Li JX | title = [Clinical observation of target-controlled remifentanil infusion combined with propofol and doxapram in painless artificial abortion] | journal = Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao | volume = 26 | issue = 8 | pages = 1206–8 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16939923 }}</ref> Newer drugs such as [[BIMU-8]] and [[CX-546]] may be much more effective.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Manzke T, Guenther U, Ponimaskin EG, Haller M, Dutschmann M, Schwarzacher S, Richter DW | title = 5-HT4(a) receptors avert opioid-induced breathing depression without loss of analgesia | journal = Science | volume = 301 | issue = 5630 | pages = 226–9 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12855812 | doi = 10.1126/science.1084674 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang X, Dergacheva O, Kamendi H, Gorini C, Mendelowitz D | title = 5-Hydroxytryptamine 1A/7 and 4alpha receptors differentially prevent opioid-induced inhibition of brain stem cardiorespiratory function | journal = Hypertension | volume = 50 | issue = 2 | pages = 368–76 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17576856 | doi = 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.107.091033 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ren J, Poon BY, Tang Y, Funk GD, Greer JJ | title = Ampakines alleviate respiratory depression in rats | journal = Am.

===Opioid-induced hyperalgesia===

Side effects such as hyperalgesia and [[allodynia]], sometimes accompanied by a worsening of [[neuropathic pain]], may be consequences of long-term treatment with opioid analgesics, especially when increasing tolerance has resulted in loss of efficacy and consequent progressive dose escalation over time. This appears to largely be a result of actions of opioid drugs at targets other than the three classic opioid receptors, including the [[nociceptin receptor]], [[sigma receptor]] and [[Toll-like receptor 4]], and can be counteracted in animal models by antagonists at these targets such as [[J-113,397]], [[BD-1047]] or [[(+)-Naloxone|(+)-naloxone]] respectively.<ref name="pmid20021351">{{cite journal |vauthors=Díaz JL, Zamanillo D, Corbera J, Baeyens JM, Maldonado R, Pericàs MA, Vela JM, Torrens A | title = Selective sigma-1 (sigma1) receptor antagonists: emerging target for the treatment of neuropathic pain | journal = Central Nervous System Agents in Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 172–83 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 20021351 | doi = 10.2174/1871524910909030172 }}</ref> No drugs are currently approved specifically for counteracting opioid-induced hyperalgesia in humans and in severe cases the only solution may be to discontinue use of opioid analgesics and replace them with non-opioid analgesic drugs.

=== Other adverse effects ===

====Hormone imbalance====
Clinical studies have consistently associated medical and recreational opioid use with [[hypogonadism]] and [[hormone imbalance]] in different sexes. The effect is [[dose–response relationship|dose-dependent]]. Most studies suggest that the majority (perhaps as much as 90%) of chronic opioid users suffer hormone imbalances. Opioids can also interfere with menstruation in women by limiting the production of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH). Opioid-induced endocrinopathy likely causes the strong association of opioid use with [[osteoporosis]] and [[bone fracture]]. It also may increase pain and thereby interfere with the intended clinical effect of opioid treatment. Opioid-induced endocrinopathy is likely caused by their agonism of opioid receptors in the [[hypothalamus]] and the [[pituitary gland]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} One study found that the depressed testosterone levels of heroin addicts returned to normal within one month of abstinence, suggesting that the effect is not permanent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} {{As of|2013}}, the effect of low-dose or acute opiate use on the endocrine system is unclear.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Brennan MJ | title = The effect of opioid therapy on endocrine function | journal = Am.

====Rare side effects====
Infrequent adverse reactions in patients taking opioids for pain relief include: dose-related respiratory depression (especially with more [[potency (pharmacology)|potent]] opioids), confusion, [[hallucinations]], [[delirium]], [[urticaria]], [[hypothermia]], [[bradycardia]]/[[tachycardia]], [[orthostatic hypotension]], dizziness, headache, urinary retention, ureteric or biliary spasm, muscle rigidity, myoclonus (with high doses), and flushing (due to histamine release, except fentanyl and remifentanil).<ref name=oxford/>
Both therapeutic and chronic use of opioids can compromise the function of the [[immune system]].  Opioids decrease the proliferation of [[macrophage]] progenitor cells and [[lymphocyte]]s, and affect cell differentiation (Roy & Loh, 1996).  Opioids may also inhibit [[leukocyte]] migration.  However the relevance of this in the context of pain relief is not known.

Physicians treating patients using opioids in combination with other drugs keep continual documentation that further treatment is indicated and remain aware of opportunities to adjust treatment if the patient's condition changes to merit less risky therapy.<ref name="Gudin"/>

===With other depressant drugs===
The concurrent use of opioids with other depressant drugs such as benzodiazepines or ethanol increases the rates of adverse events and overdose.<ref name="Gudin">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gudin JA, Mogali S, Jones JD, Comer SD | title = Risks, Management, and Monitoring of Combination Opioid, Benzodiazepines, and/or Alcohol Use | journal = Postgraduate Medicine | volume = 125 | issue = 4 | pages = 115–130 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23933900 | pmc =  4057040| doi = 10.3810/pgm.2013.07.2684 }}</ref> As with an overdose of opioid alone, the combination of an opioid and another depressant may precipitate respiratory depression often leading to death.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Stuth EA, Stucke AG, Zuperku EJ | title = Effects of Anesthetics, Sedatives, and Opioids on Ventilatory Control | journal = Comprehensive Physiology | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 2281–2367 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23720250 | doi = 10.1002/cphy.c100061 | isbn = 9780470650714}}</ref> These risks are lessened with close monitoring by a physician, who may conduct ongoing screening for changes in patient behavior and treatment compliance.<ref name="Gudin"/>

===Opioid antagonist===
{{main article|opioid antagonist}}
Opioid effects (adverse or otherwise) can be reversed with an opioid antagonist such as [[naloxone]] or [[naltrexone]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gowing|first=Linda|last2=Ali|first2=Robert|last3=White|first3=Jason M.|date=2017|title=Opioid antagonists with minimal sedation for opioid withdrawal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28553701|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=5|pages=CD002021|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002021.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=28553701|via=}}</ref> These [[competitive antagonist]]s bind to the opioid receptors with higher affinity than agonists but do not activate the receptors. This displaces the agonist, attenuating or reversing the agonist effects. However, the [[elimination half-life]] of naloxone can be shorter than that of the opioid itself, so repeat dosing or continuous infusion may be required, or a longer acting antagonist such as [[nalmefene]] may be used. In patients taking opioids regularly it is essential that the opioid is only partially reversed to avoid a severe and distressing reaction of waking in excruciating pain. This is achieved by not giving a full dose but giving this in small doses until the respiratory rate has improved. An infusion is then started to keep the reversal at that level, while maintaining pain relief. Opioid antagonists remain the standard treatment for respiratory depression following opioid overdose, with naloxone being by far the most commonly used, although the longer acting antagonist nalmefene may be used for treating overdoses of long-acting opioids such as methadone, and diprenorphine is used for reversing the effects of extremely potent opioids used in veterinary medicine such as etorphine and carfentanil. However, since opioid antagonists also block the beneficial effects of opioid analgesics, they are generally useful only for treating overdose, with use of opioid antagonists alongside opioid analgesics to reduce side effects, requiring careful dose titration and often being poorly effective at doses low enough to allow analgesia to be maintained.

Opioids bind to specific [[opioid receptor]]s in the [[nervous system]] and other tissues.  There are three principal classes of opioid receptors, [[mu opioid receptor|μ]], [[kappa opioid receptor|κ]], [[delta opioid receptor|δ]] (mu, kappa, and delta), although up to seventeen have been reported, and  include the ε, ι, λ, and ζ (Epsilon, Iota, Lambda and Zeta) receptors.  Conversely, σ ([[sigma receptor|Sigma]]) receptors are no longer considered to be opioid receptors because their activation is not reversed by the opioid inverse-agonist [[naloxone]], they do not exhibit high-affinity binding for classical opioids, and they are stereoselective for [[Dextrorotation|dextro-rotatory]] [[isomers]] while the other opioid receptors are stereo-selective for [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|levo-rotatory]] isomers. In addition, there are three subtypes of [[mu opioid receptor|μ]]-receptor: μ<sub>1</sub> and μ<sub>2</sub>, and the newly discovered μ<sub>3</sub>.  Another receptor of clinical importance is the opioid-receptor-like receptor 1 (ORL1), which is involved in pain responses as well as having a major role in the development of tolerance to μ-opioid agonists used as analgesics.  These are all [[G-protein coupled receptor]]s acting on [[GABA]]ergic [[neurotransmission]].

[[File:Morphine structure.svg|thumb|220 px|[[Locant]]s of the morphine molecule]]

The [[pharmacodynamic]] response to an opioid depends upon the receptor to which it binds, its affinity for that receptor, and whether the opioid is an [[agonist]] or an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]].  For example, the [[supraspinal (disambiguation)|supraspinal]] analgesic properties of the opioid agonist [[morphine]] are mediated by activation of the μ<sub>1</sub> receptor; respiratory depression and [[Substance dependence|physical dependence]] by the μ<sub>2</sub> receptor; and sedation and spinal analgesia by the κ receptor{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}.  Each group of opioid receptors elicits a distinct set of neurological responses, with the receptor subtypes (such as μ<sub>1</sub> and μ<sub>2</sub> for example) providing even more [measurably] specific responses.  Unique to each opioid is its distinct binding affinity to the various classes of opioid receptors (''e.g.'' the μ, κ, and δ opioid receptors are activated at different magnitudes according to the specific receptor binding affinities of the opioid). For example, the opiate alkaloid [[morphine]] exhibits high-affinity binding to the μ-opioid receptor, while [[ketazocine]] exhibits high affinity to ĸ receptors.  It is this combinatorial mechanism that allows for such a wide class of opioids and molecular designs to exist, each with its own unique effect profile. Their individual molecular structure is also responsible for their different duration of action, whereby metabolic breakdown (such as ''N''-dealkylation) is responsible for opioid metabolism.

===Functional selectivity===
A new strategy of drug development takes receptor [[signal transduction]] into consideration. This strategy strives to increase the activation of desirable signalling pathways while reducing the impact on undesirable pathways. This differential strategy has been given several names, including [[functional selectivity]] and biased agonism. The first opioid that was intentionally designed as a biased agonist and placed into [[Clinical trial|clinical evaluation]] is the drug [[oliceridine]]. It displays analgesic activity and reduced adverse effects.<ref>{{cite journal | author = DeWire SM | year = 2013 | title =  A G protein-biased ligand at the μ-opioid receptor is potently analgesic with reduced gastrointestinal and respiratory dysfunction compared with morphine.| journal = [[J Pharmacol Exp Ther]] | volume = 344 | issue = 3| pages = 708–17 | doi = 10.1124/jpet.112.201616 | pmid = 23300227 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>

===Opioid comparison===
{{Main article|Equianalgesic}}

Extensive research has been conducted to determine equivalence ratios comparing the relative potency of opioids. Given a dose of an opioid, an [[equianalgesic]] table is used to find the equivalent dosage of another. Such tables are used in opioid rotation practices, and to describe an opioid by comparison to morphine, the reference opioid. Equianalgesic tables typically list drug half-lives, and sometimes equianalgesic doses of the same drug by means of administration, such as morphine: oral and intravenous.

{{Global estimates of illicit drug users}}
Opioid prescriptions in the US increased from 76 million in 1991 to 207 million in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Volkow|first1=Nora D.|title=America’s Addiction to Opioids: Heroin and Prescription Drug Abuse|url=https://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/legislative-activities/testimony-to-congress/2016/americas-addiction-to-opioids-heroin-prescription-drug-abuse#_ftn5|website=DrugAbuse.GOV|publisher=National Institute on Drug Abuse|accessdate=April 30, 2017}}</ref>

In the 1990s, opioid prescribing increased significantly. Once used almost exclusively for the treatment of acute pain or pain due to cancer, opioids are now prescribed liberally for people experiencing chronic pain. This has been accompanied by rising rates of accidental addiction and accidental overdoses leading to death. According to the [[International Narcotics Control Board]], the United States and Canada lead the per capita consumption of prescription opioids.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.incb.org/documents/Narcotic-Drugs/Technical-Publications/2012/Narcotic_Drugs_Report_2012.pdf |title=Narcotic Drugs Stupéfiants Estupefacientes|year=2012|publisher=INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS CONTROL BOARD|accessdate=March 6, 2017}}</ref> The number of opioid prescriptions in the United States and Canada is double the consumption in the European Union, Australia, and New Zealand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.painpolicy.wisc.edu/opioid-consumption-data |title=Opioid Consumption Data &#124; Pain & Policy Studies Group |publisher=Painpolicy.wisc.edu |accessdate=2016-01-07}}</ref> Certain populations have been affected by the opioid addiction crisis more than others, including [[First World]] communities<ref>{{cite journal|title=Researching Prescription Drug Misuse among First Nations in Canada: Starting from a Health Promotion Framework  |pmc=3411531 | pmid=22879752 |doi=10.4137/SART.S9247 |volume=6 |year=2012 |journal=Subst Abuse |pages=23–31 |vauthors=Dell CA, Roberts G, Kilty J, Taylor K, Daschuk M, Hopkins C, Dell D }}</ref> and low-income populations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ices.on.ca/Newsroom/News-Releases/2011/Socially-disadvantaged-Ontarians-being-prescribed-opiods |title=Socially disadvantaged Ontarians being prescribed opioids on an ongoing basis and at doses that far exceed Canadian guidelines |publisher=Ices.on.ca |date=2011-01-25 |accessdate=2016-01-07}}</ref> Public health specialists say that this may result from unavailability or high cost of alternative methods for addressing chronic pain.<ref name="cpso.on.ca">{{cite web|url=http://www.cpso.on.ca/CPSO/media/uploadedfiles/policies/policies/Opioid_report_final.pdf |title=Avoiding Abuse, Achieving a Balance: Tackling the Opioid Public Health Crisis |publisher=College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario|date=September 8, 2010|accessdate=March 6, 2017}}</ref>

Non-clinical use was criminalized in the United States by the [[Harrison Narcotics Tax Act]] of 1914, and by other laws worldwide. Since then, nearly all non-clinical use of opioids has been rated zero on the scale of approval of nearly every social institution. However, in United Kingdom the 1926 report of the Departmental Committee on [[Morphine]] and Heroin [[Substance use disorder|Addiction]] under the Chairmanship of the President of the Royal College of Physicians reasserted medical control and established the "British system" of control—which lasted until the 1960s; in the U.S. the [[Controlled Substances Act]] of 1970 markedly relaxed the harshness of the Harrison Act.

Before the twentieth century, institutional approval was often higher, even in Europe and America. In some cultures, approval of opioids was significantly higher than approval of alcohol. Opiates were used to treat depression and anxiety until the mid-1950s.<ref>see Abse; Berridge; Bodkin; Callaway; Emrich; Gold; Gutstein; Mongan; Portenoy; Reynolds; Takano; Verebey; Walsh; Way.<!--Note 37 detailed citations on Talk page.--></ref>

{{Main|Opioid crisis}}

===Definition===

The term "opioid" originated in the 1950s.<ref>{{Cite web|title = opioid: definition of opioid in Oxford dictionary (American English) (US)|url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/opioid|website = www.oxforddictionaries.com|access-date = 2016-02-14|quote = Opioid: 1950s: from opium + -oid.}}</ref> It combines "opium" + "-oid" meaning "opiate-like" ("opiates" being morphine and similar drugs derived from [[opium]]). The first scientific publication to use it, in 1963, included a footnote stating, "In this paper, the term, 'opioid', is used in the sense originally proposed by George H. Acheson (personal communication) to refer to any chemical compound with morphine-like activities".<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Factors regulating oral consumption of an opioid (etonitazene) by morphine-addicted rats|journal = Psychopharmacologia|date = 1963-10-24|pmid = 14082382|pages = 55–76|volume = 5|first = A.|last = Wikler|first2 = W.

===Global shortages===
[[Morphine]] and other poppy-based medicines have been identified by [[the World Health Organization]] as essential in the treatment of severe pain. As of 2002, seven countries (USA, UK, Italy, Australia, France, Spain and Japan) use 77% of the world's [[morphine]] supplies, leaving many emerging countries lacking in pain relief medication.<ref>{{cite web |title=Feasibility Study on Opium Licensing in Afghanistan for the Production of Morphine and Other Essential Medicines |date=September 2005 |publisher=ICoS |url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Publications/Detail/?id=13751&lng=en}}</ref> The current system of supply of raw poppy materials to make poppy-based medicines is regulated by the [[International Narcotics Control Board]] under the provision of the 1961 [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]]. The amount of raw poppy materials that each country can demand annually based on these provisions must correspond to an estimate of the country's needs taken from the national consumption within the preceding two years. In many countries, underprescription of morphine is rampant because of the high prices and the lack of training in the prescription of poppy-based drugs. The [[World Health Organization]] is now working with administrations from various countries to train healthworkers and to develop national regulations regarding drug prescription to facilitate a greater prescription of poppy-based medicines.<ref>{{cite web |title=Assuring Availability of Opioid Analgesics |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/e76503.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>

Another idea to increase morphine availability is proposed by the [[Senlis Council]], who suggest, through their proposal for [[Afghan Morphine]], that [[Afghanistan]] could provide cheap pain relief solutions to emerging countries as part of a second-tier system of supply that would complement the current [[INCB]] regulated system by maintaining the balance and closed system that it establishes while providing finished product morphine to those suffering from severe pain and unable to access poppy-based drugs under the current system.

===Recreational use===
{{See also|Opioid use disorder|Recreational drug use}}

Traditionally associated with illicit opioids such as heroin, prescription opioids are misused recreationally. 

[[Drug misuse]] and non-medical use include the use of drugs for reasons or at doses other than prescribed. Opioid misuse can also include providing medications to persons for whom it was not prescribed.

==Classification==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2011}}
There are a number of broad classes of opioids:
* '''Natural''' [[opiates]]: [[alkaloids]] contained in the resin of the [[opium poppy]], primarily [[morphine]], [[codeine]], and [[thebaine]], but not [[papaverine]] and [[noscapine]] which have a different mechanism of action; The following could be considered natural opiates: The leaves from [[Mitragyna speciosa]] (also known as [[kratom]]) contain a few naturally-occurring opioids, active via Mu- and Delta receptors. [[Salvinorin A]], found naturally in the [[Salvia divinorum]] plant, is a kappa-opioid receptor agonist.
* '''[[Opiate#Esters of morphine|Esters of morphine]]''' opiates: slightly chemically altered but more natural than the semi-synthetics, as most are morphine prodrugs, [[diacetylmorphine]] (morphine diacetate; heroin), [[nicomorphine]] (morphine dinicotinate), [[dipropanoylmorphine]] (morphine dipropionate), [[desomorphine]], [[acetylpropionylmorphine]], [[dibenzoylmorphine]], [[diacetyldihydromorphine]];<ref name=unodc>{{cite web|title=Esters of Morphine|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1953-01-01_2_page009.html|publisher=[[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]]|accessdate=10 March 2012|orig-year=1953}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.eopiates.com/opioids/classification/esters-of-morphine-opioids.html|title = Esters of Morphine Opioids|date = 2014-05-28|access-date = 2016-02-12|website = eOpiates }}</ref>
* '''Semi-synthetic''' opioids: created from either the natural opiates or morphine esters, such as [[hydromorphone]], [[hydrocodone]], [[oxycodone]], [[oxymorphone]], [[ethylmorphine]] and [[buprenorphine]];
* '''Fully synthetic''' opioids: such as [[fentanyl]], [[pethidine]], [[levorphanol]], [[methadone]], [[tramadol]], [[tapentadol]], and [[dextropropoxyphene]];
* '''[[Endogenous]]''' opioid [[peptide]]s, produced naturally in the body, such as [[endorphin]]s, [[enkephalin]]s, [[dynorphin]]s, and [[endomorphin]]s. Morphine, and some other opioids, which are produced in small amounts in the body, are included in this category.
[[Tramadol]] and [[tapentadol]], which act as monoamine uptake inhibitors also act as mild and potent [[agonist]]s (respectively) of the [[μ-opioid receptor]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Mechanistic and functional differentiation of tapentadol and tramadol|journal = Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy|date = 2012-07-01|issn = 1744-7666|pmid = 22698264|pages = 1437–1449|volume = 13|issue = 10|doi = 10.1517/14656566.2012.696097|first = Robert B.|last = Raffa|first2 = Helmut|last2 = Buschmann|first3 = Thomas|last3 = Christoph|first4 = Gary|last4 = Eichenbaum|first5 = Werner|last5 = Englberger|first6 = Christopher M.|last6 = Flores|first7 = Torsten|last7 = Hertrampf|first8 = Babette|last8 = Kögel|first9 = Klaus|last9 = Schiene}}</ref>  Both drugs produce [[analgesia]] even when [[naloxone]], an opioid antagonist, is administered.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rojas-Corrales MO, Gibert-Rahola J, Micó JA | title = Tramadol induces antidepressant-type effects in mice | journal = Life Sci. | volume = 63 | issue = 12 | pages = PL175–80 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9749830 | doi = 10.1016/S0024-3205(98)00369-5 | url =  }}</ref>

Some minor opium [[alkaloids]] and various substances with opioid action are also found elsewhere, including molecules present in [[kratom]], ''[[Corydalis]]'', and ''[[Salvia divinorum]]'' plants and some species of poppy aside from ''Papaver somniferum''. There are also strains which produce copious amounts of thebaine, an important raw material for making many semi-synthetic and synthetic opioids.  Of all of the more than 120 poppy species, only two produce morphine.

Amongst analgesics there are a small number of agents which act on the central nervous system but not on the opioid receptor system and therefore have none of the other (narcotic) qualities of opioids although they may produce euphoria by relieving pain—a euphoria that, because of the way it is produced, does not form the basis of habituation, physical dependence, or addiction.  Foremost amongst these are [[nefopam]], [[orphenadrine]], and perhaps [[phenyltoloxamine]] or some other [[antihistamines]].  [[Tricyclic antidepressant]]s have painkilling effect as well, but they're thought to do so by indirectly activating the endogenous opioid system. Paracetamol is predominantly a centrally acting analgesic (non-narcotic) which mediates its effect by action on descending serotoninergic (5-hydroxy triptaminergic) pathways, to increase 5-HT release (which inhibits release of pain mediators). It also decreases cyclo-oxygenase activity. It has recently been discovered that most or all of the therapeutic efficacy of paracetamol is due to a metabolite, [[AM404]], which enhances the release of serotonin and inhibits the uptake of [[anandamide]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Other analgesics work peripherally (''i.e.'', not on the brain or spinal cord). Research is starting to show that morphine and related drugs may indeed have peripheral effects as well, such as morphine gel working on burns. Recent investigations discovered opioid receptors on peripheral sensory neurons.<ref name="Stein C, Schäfer M, Machelska H (2003)">{{cite journal |vauthors=Stein C, Schäfer M, Machelska H | title = Attacking pain at its source: new perspectives on opioids | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = 8 | pages = 1003–1008 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12894165 | doi = 10.1038/nm908 | url =  }}</ref> A significant fraction (up to 60%) of opioid analgesia can be mediated by such peripheral opioid receptors, particularly in inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, traumatic or surgical pain.<ref name="Stein C, Lang LJ (2009)">{{cite journal |vauthors=Stein C, Lang LJ | title = Peripheral mechanisms of opioid analgesia | journal = Curr Opin Pharmacol | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–8 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19157985 | doi = 10.1016/j.coph.2008.12.009 | url =  }}</ref> Inflammatory pain is also blunted by endogenous opioid peptides activating peripheral opioid receptors.<ref name="Busch-Dienstfertig M, Stein C (2010)">{{cite journal |vauthors=Busch-Dienstfertig M, Stein C | title = Opioid receptors and opioid peptide-producing leukocytes in inflammatory pain-basic and therapeutic aspects | journal = Brain Behav Immun | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 683–694 | year = 2010 | pmid = 19879349 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbi.2009.10.013 | url =  }}</ref>

It was discovered in 1953,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} that humans and some animals naturally produce minute amounts of morphine, codeine, and possibly some of their simpler derivatives like heroin and [[dihydromorphine]], in addition to endogenous opioid peptides.  Some bacteria are capable of producing some semi-synthetic opioids such as [[hydromorphone]] and [[hydrocodone]] when living in a solution containing morphine or codeine respectively.

Many of the [[alkaloids]] and other derivatives of the opium poppy are not opioids or narcotics; the best example is the smooth-muscle relaxant [[papaverine]]. Noscapine is a marginal case as it does have CNS effects but not necessarily similar to morphine, and it is probably in a category all its own.<br>
[[Dextromethorphan]] (the stereoisomer of [[levomethorphan]], a semi-synthetic opioid agonist) and its metabolite [[dextrorphan]] have no opioid analgesic effect at all despite their structural similarity to other opioids; instead they are potent [[NMDA|NMDA antagonists]] and [[sigma receptor|sigma 1 and 2]]-receptor agonists and are used in many [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] cough suppressants.
<br>
[[Salvinorin A]] is a unique selective, powerful ĸ-opioid receptor agonist. It is not properly considered an opioid nevertheless, because:
# chemically, it is not an alkaloid; and
# it has no typical opioid properties: absolutely no anxiolytic or cough-suppressant effects. It is instead a powerful [[hallucinogen]].

===Endogenous opioids===

Opioid-[[peptide]]s that are produced in the body include:
{{colbegin|2}}
* [[Endorphin]]s
* [[Enkephalin]]s
* [[Dynorphin]]s
* [[Endomorphin]]s
{{colend}}
[[β-endorphin]] is expressed in [[Pro-opiomelanocortin]] (POMC) cells in the [[arcuate nucleus]], in the [[brainstem]] and in immune cells, and acts through [[μ-opioid receptor]]s. β-endorphin has many effects, including on [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]] and [[appetite]]. β-endorphin is also secreted into the circulation from pituitary [[corticotropes]] and [[melanotrope]]s. [[α-neo-endorphin]] is also expressed in POMC cells in the arcuate nucleus.

[[met-enkephalin]] is widely distributed in the CNS and in immune cells; [met]-enkephalin is a product of the [[proenkephalin]] gene, and acts through μ and [[δ-opioid receptor]]s. [[leu-enkephalin]], also a product of the proenkephalin gene, acts through δ-opioid receptors.

[[Dynorphin]] acts through [[κ-opioid receptor]]s, and is widely distributed in the CNS, including in the [[spinal cord]] and [[hypothalamus]], including in particular the [[arcuate nucleus]] and in both [[oxytocin]] and [[vasopressin]] neurons in the [[supraoptic nucleus]].

[[Endomorphin]] acts through μ-opioid receptors, and is more potent than other endogenous opioids at these receptors.
