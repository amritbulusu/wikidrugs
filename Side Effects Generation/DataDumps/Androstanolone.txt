{{About|dihydrotestosterone as a medication|as a natural hormone|Dihydrotestosterone}}

'''Androstanolone''', or '''stanolone''', also known as '''dihydrotestosterone''' ('''DHT'''), is a [[natural product|naturally occurring]] [[anabolic-androgenic steroid]] (AAS) and [[androgen]] [[steroid hormone]] which is used medically in the treatment of male [[hypogonadism]] (androgen deficiency). It is a [[chemical derivative|derivative]] of [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]], specifically being 5α-dihydrotestosterone, and is a [[potency (pharmacology)|potent]] [[agonist]] of the [[androgen receptor]] (AR). Relative to testosterone, androstanolone is a considerably more potent as an AR agonist.

==Medical uses==
Androstanolone is available in [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]] [[drug form|formulation]]s for [[medicine|medical use]] as an androgen and AAS.<ref name="HydeGengenbach2007">{{cite book | first1 = Thomas E. | last1 = Hyde | first2 = Marianne S. | last2 = Gengenbach | name-list-format = vanc | title = Conservative Management of Sports Injuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uzPwfNYyjjUC&pg=PA1100|year=2007|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-0-7637-3252-3|pages=1100–}}</ref> It is used mainly in the treatment of male [[hypogonadism]].<ref name="AdisInsight" />

==Side effects==
{{See also|Anabolic steroid#Adverse effects}}

[[Adverse effect]]s of androstanolone are similar to those of other AAS and include [[androgen]]ic side effects like [[oily skin]], [[acne]], [[seborrhea]], increased [[facial hair|facial]]/[[body hair]] [[hair growth|growth]], [[pattern hair loss|scalp hair loss]], and increased [[aggressiveness]] and [[sex drive]].<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /><ref name="Kicman2008" /> In women, androstanolone can cause partially irreversible [[virilization]], for instance [[voice deepening]], [[hirsutism]], [[clitoromegaly]], [[breast atrophy]], and [[muscle hypertrophy]], as well as [[menstrual irregularity|menstrual disturbance]]s and reversible [[infertility]].<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /><ref name="Kicman2008" /> In men, the drug may also cause [[hypogonadism]], [[testicular atrophy]], and reversible infertility at sufficiently high dosages.<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /><ref name="Kicman2008" />

Androstanolone can have adverse effects on the [[cardiovascular system]], especially with long-term administration of high dosages.<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /> AAS like androstanolone stimulate [[erythropoiesis]] ([[red blood cell]] production) and increase [[hematocrit]] levels and at high dosages can cause [[polycythemia]] (overproduction of red blood cells), which can greatly increase the risk of [[thrombosis|thrombic]] events such as [[embolism]] and [[stroke]].<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /> Unlike many other AAS, androstanolone is not [[aromatase|aromatized]] and has no risk of [[estrogen]]ic side effects like [[gynecomastia]], [[water retention (medicine)|fluid retention]], or [[edema]].<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /><ref name="Kicman2008" /> In addition, as it is not a [[17α-alkylated anabolic steroid|17α-alkylated]] AAS and is administered parenterally, androstanolone has no risk of [[hepatotoxicity]].<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /><ref name="Kicman2008" />

==Pharmacology==
Androstanolone is a [[potency (pharmacology)|potent]] [[agonist]] of the AR. It has an [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] (K<sub>d</sub>) of 0.25 to 0.5&nbsp;nM for the human AR, which is about 2- to 3-fold higher than that of [[testosterone]] (K<sub>d</sub> = 0.4 to 1.0&nbsp;nM)<ref name="MozayaniRaymon2011">{{cite book | first1 = Ashraf | last1 = Mozayani | first2 = Lionel | last2 = Raymon | name-list-format = vanc | title = Handbook of Drug Interactions: A Clinical and Forensic Guide | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NhBJ6kg_uP0C&pg=PA656 | date = 18 September 2011 | publisher = Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-61779-222-9|pages=656–}}</ref> and the [[dissociation rate]] of androstanolone from the AR is also about 5-fold slower than that of testosterone.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Grino PB, Griffin JE, Wilson JD | title = Testosterone at high concentrations interacts with the human androgen receptor similarly to dihydrotestosterone | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 126 | issue = 2 | pages = 1165–72 | date = February 1990 | pmid = 2298157 | doi = 10.1210/endo-126-2-1165 }}</ref> The [[EC50|EC<sub>50</sub>]] of androstanolone for activation of the AR is 0.13&nbsp;nM, which is about 5-fold stronger than that of testosterone (EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.66&nbsp;nM).<ref>{{cite book | first = Peter A. | last = Wilderer | name-list-format = vanc | title = Treatise on Water Science, Four-Volume Set | chapter = Bioassays for Estrogenic and Androgenic Effects of Water Constituents | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HSPtBDpRSXMC&pg=PT1805 | date = 1 September 2010 | publisher = Newnes | isbn = 978-0-444-53199-5 | pages = 1805– }}</ref> In [[bioassay]]s, androstanolone has been found to be 2.5- to 10-fold more potent than testosterone.<ref name="MozayaniRaymon2011" />

Unlike testosterone and various other AAS, androstanolone cannot be [[aromatase|aromatized]], and for this reason, poses no risk of [[estrogen]]ic [[side effect]]s like [[gynecomastia]] at any dosage.<ref name="Malven1993">{{cite book | first = Paul V. | last = Malven | name-list-format = vanc | title = Mammalian Neuroendocrinology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nZoRPQa_qTkC&pg=PA228|date=12 January 1993|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-8757-9|pages=228–}}</ref> In addition, androstanolone cannot be [[metabolism|metabolized]] by [[5α-reductase]] (as it is already 5α-reduced), and for this reason, is not potentiated in so-called "androgenic" tissues like the [[skin]], [[hair follicle]]s, and [[prostate gland]], thereby improving its ratio of [[anabolic]] to [[androgen]]ic effects. However, androstanolone is nonetheless described as a very poor anabolic agent.<ref name="Llewellyn2009">{{cite book|author=William Llewellyn|title=Anabolics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=afKLA-6wW0oC|year=2009|publisher=Molecular Nutrition Llc|isbn=978-0967930473|pages=19,163}}</ref> This is attributed to its high affinity as a [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] for [[3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]] (3α-HSD), which is highly expressed in [[skeletal muscle]] and inactivates androstanolone into [[3α-androstanediol]], a metabolite with very weak AR activity.<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /> Unlike androstanolone, testosterone is very resistant to metabolism by 3α-HSD, and so is not similarly inactivated in skeletal muscle.<ref name="Llewellyn2009" />

==Pharmacokinetics==
