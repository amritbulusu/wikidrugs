==Uses==
Asparaginases can be used for different industrial and pharmaceutical purposes.

===Medical===
''E. coli'' strains are the main source of medical asparaginase.<ref name="js" /> Branded formulations (with different chemical and pharmacological properties) available in 1998 include Asparaginase Medac, Ciderolase, and Oncaspar.<ref name="js" />{{rp|5}} (Crasnitin has been discontinued.) Spectrila is a new recombinant E. coli asparaginase.<ref>https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/32147</ref>

Asparaginase produced by ''[[Erwinia chrysanthemi]]'' instead is known as crisantaspase ([[British Approved Name|BAN]]), and is available in the [[United Kingdom]] under the trade name Erwinase.<ref name=BNF57>{{cite book |title=[[British National Formulary]] (BNF 57) |date=March 2009 |publisher=[[BMJ Group]] and RPS Publishing |location=United Kingdom |isbn=978-0-85369-845-6 |page=476 |chapter=8.1.5: Other antineoplastic drugs |author8=[[British Medical Association]], [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain]]}}</ref>

One of the E. coli asparaginases marketed under the brand name Elspar for the treatment of [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] (ALL)<ref name=BNF57/> is also used in some [[mast cell tumor]] protocols.<ref name="pmid17554375">{{cite journal |vauthors=Appel IM, van Kessel-Bakvis C, Stigter R, Pieters R |title=Influence of two different regimens of concomitant treatment with asparaginase and dexamethason] on hemostasis in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia |journal= Leukemia|volume= 21|issue= 11|pages= 2377–80|year=2007 |pmid=17554375 |doi=10.1038/sj.leu.2404793}}</ref>

Unlike most of other [[chemotherapy]] agents, asparaginase can be given as an intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intravenous injection without fear of tissue irritation.

===Food manufacturing===
The most common use of asparaginases is as a processing aid in the manufacture of food. Marketed under the brand names Acrylaway and PreventASe, asparaginases are used as a food processing aid to reduce the formation of [[acrylamide]], a suspected [[carcinogen]], in starchy food products such as snacks and biscuits.<ref name="kornbrust">Kornbrust, B.A., Stringer, M.A., Lange, N.K. and Hendriksen, H.V. (2010) Asparaginase – an enzyme for acrylamide reduction in food products. In: Enzymes in Food Technology, 2nd Edition. (eds Robert J. Whitehurst and Maarten Van Oort). Wiley-Blackwell, UK, pp. 59-87.</ref>

==Side effects==

The main [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effect]] is an [[allergic reaction|allergic]] or hypersensitivity reaction; [[anaphylaxis]] is a possibility.<ref name=BNF57/> Additionally, it can also be associated with a [[coagulopathy]] as it decreases protein synthesis, including synthesis of coagulation factors (e.g. progressive isolated decrease of [[fibrinogen]]) and anticoagulant factor (generally [[antithrombin]] III; sometimes [[protein C]] & [[protein S|S]] as well), leading to [[bleeding]] or [[Blood clotting|thrombotic events]] such as stroke.<ref name="js">{{Cite journal | last1 = Müller | first1 = H. | title = Use of L-asparaginase in childhood ALL | doi = 10.1016/S1040-8428(98)00015-8 | journal = Critical Reviews in Oncology/Hematology | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages =  97–113| year = 1998 | pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> [[Bone marrow suppression]] is common but only mild to moderate, rarely reaches clinical significance and therapeutic consequences are rarely required.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Johnston | first1 = P.

Other common side effects include [[pancreatitis]].

==Mechanism of action==

===As a food processing aid===

Acrylamide is often formed in the cooking of starchy foods. During heating the [[amino acid]] [[asparagine]], naturally present in starchy foods, undergoes a process called the [[Maillard reaction]], which is responsible for giving baked or fried foods their brown color, crust, and toasted flavor. Suspected carcinogens such as acrylamide and some heterocyclic amines are also generated in the Maillard reaction. By adding asparaginase before baking or frying the food, asparagine is converted into another common amino acid, [[aspartic acid]], and [[ammonium]]. As a result, asparagine cannot take part in the Maillard reaction, and therefore the formation of acrylamide is significantly reduced. Complete acrylamide removal is probably not possible due to other, minor asparagine-independent formation pathways.<ref name="kornbrust"/>

As a food processing aid, asparaginases can effectively reduce the level of acrylamide up to 90% in a range of starchy foods without changing the taste and appearance of the end product.<ref>{{Cite journal| last1 = Hendriksen| first1 = H.V.| last2 = Kornbrust| first2 = B.A.| last3 = Oestergaard| first3 = P.R.| last4 = Stringer| first4 = M.A.| authorlink = | title = Evaluating the Potential for Enzymatic Acrylamide Mitigation in a Range of Food Products Using an Asparaginase from Aspergillus oryzae| journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry| volume = 57| issue = 10| pages = 4168–4176| publisher = | location = | date = April 23, 2009| url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf900174q| issn = | doi = 10.1021/jf900174q| id = | accessdate = October 8, 2010| pmid = 19388639}}</ref>

===As a drug===

The rationale behind asparaginase is that it takes advantage of the fact that acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells and some other suspected tumor cells are unable to synthesize the [[non-essential amino acid]] asparagine, whereas normal cells are able to make their own asparagine; thus leukemic cells require high amount of asparagine.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fernandes|first1=H. S.|last2=Teixeira|first2=C. S. Silva|last3=Fernandes|first3=P. A.|last4=Ramos|first4=M. J.|last5=Cerqueira|first5=N. M. F. S. A.|title=Amino acid deprivation using enzymes as a targeted therapy for cancer and viral infections|journal=Expert Opinion on Therapeutic Patents|date=4 November 2016|volume=0|issue=ja|pages=null|doi=10.1080/13543776.2017.1254194|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13543776.2017.1254194|issn=1354-3776|pmid=27813440}}</ref> These leukemic cells depend on circulating asparagine. Asparaginase, however, catalyzes the conversion of <small>L</small>-asparagine to aspartic acid and [[ammonia]]. This deprives the leukemic cell of circulating asparagine, which leads to [[cell death]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Broome | first1 = J. D. | title = L-Asparaginase: Discovery and development as a tumor-inhibitory agent | journal = Cancer treatment reports | volume = 65 Suppl 4 | pages = 111–114 | year = 1981 | pmid = 7049374}}</ref>

===Enzyme regulation===
This protein may use the [[morpheein]] model of [[allosteric regulation]].<ref name=pmid22182754>{{cite journal |author1=T. Selwood |author2=E. K. Jaffe. | title = Dynamic dissociating homo-oligomers and the control of protein function. | journal = Arch. Biochem. Biophys. | volume = 519| issue = 2| pages = 131–43| year = 2011 | pmid = 22182754 | doi=10.1016/j.abb.2011.11.020 | pmc=3298769}}</ref>

==History==
The discovery and development of asparaginase as an anti-cancer drug began in 1953, when scientists first observed that [[lymphoma]]s in [[rat]] and [[mice]] regressed after treatment with [[guinea pig]] [[Serum (blood)|serum]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Kidd | first1 = J. G. | title = Regression of transplanted lymphomas induced in vivo by means of normal guinea pig serum. I. Course of transplanted cancers of various kinds in mice and rats given guinea pig serum, horse serum, or rabbit serum | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 98 | issue = 6 | pages = 565–582 | year = 1953 | pmid = 13109110 | pmc = 2136344| doi=10.1084/jem.98.6.565}}</ref> Later it was found out that it is not the serum itself which provoke the tumour regression, but rather the enzyme asparaginase.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Broome | first1 = J. D. | title = Evidence that the L-asparaginase of guinea pig serum is responsible for its antilymphoma effects. I. Properties of the L-asparaginase of guinea pig serum in relation to those of the antilymphoma substance | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 118 | issue = 1 | pages = 99–120 | year = 1963 | pmid = 14015821 | pmc = 2137570| doi=10.1084/jem.118.1.99}}</ref>

After researchers comparing different kinds of asparaginases, the one derived from ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Erwinia chrysanthemi]]'' turned out to have the best  anti-cancer ability. ''E. coli'' has thereby become the main source of asparaginase due to the factor that it is also easy to produce in large amount.<ref name="js" />
