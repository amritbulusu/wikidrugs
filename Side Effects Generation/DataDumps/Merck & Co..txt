'''Merck & Co., Inc.''' ({{nyse|MRK}}), [[Doing business as|d.b.a.]] '''Merck Sharp & Dohme''' ('''MSD''') outside the United States and Canada, is an American pharmaceutical company and one of the largest [[pharmaceutical companies]] in the world.

The company was established in 1891 as the United States subsidiary of the German company [[Merck Group|Merck]], which was founded in 1668 by the [[Merck family]]. Merck & Co. was [[Nationalization|nationalized]] by the US government during [[World War I]] and subsequently established as an independent American company in 1917. While it operates as Merck & Co. in North America, the original Merck based in Darmstadt holds the rights to the Merck name everywhere else. Merck & Co. is the world's seventh largest pharmaceutical company by [[market capitalization]] and revenue. Its headquarters is located in [[Kenilworth, New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.merck.com/contact/home.html | title=Contact Us | access-date=February 11, 2015}}</ref>

Merck & Co. publishes ''[[The Merck Manuals]]'', a series of medical reference books for physicians, nurses, technicians, and veterinarians. These include the ''[[Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy]]'', the world's best-selling medical reference. ''[[The Merck Index]]'', a compendium of chemical compounds, was formerly published by Merck & Co. before being acquired by the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] in 2012.

==Company history==

===Roots and early history===
{{Main|Merck Group}}
[[File:ENGEL APHOTHEKE.png|thumb|The Angel Pharmacy in [[Darmstadt]], the beginning of the [[Merck Group|Merck]] company]]
Merck & Co. traces its origins to its original German parent company [[Merck Group|Merck]], which was established by the [[Merck family]] in 1668 when Jacob Friedrich Merck purchased a drug store in [[Darmstadt]]. In the 19th century, the Merck company in Darmstadt evolved from a pharmacy to a major pharmaceutical company which pioneered the commercial manufacture of [[morphine]].

In 1891, family member George (Georg) Merck emigrated to the United States and set up Merck & Co. in New York as the US subsidiary of the family company. Merck & Co. operated from 1891 to 1917 as the US subsidiary of the [[Merck Group]].

===Nationalization===
The Merck Group's US subsidiary Merck & Co. was [[nationalization|nationalized]] by the US government in 1917 and re-established as an independent American company. Until the end of [[World War II]], the company was led by [[George W. Merck]]. Merck & Co. hold the trademark rights to the "Merck" name in North America, while its former parent company retains the rights in the rest of the world.<ref name="apc1919">{{cite journal |url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ie50112a030 |title=Report of the alien property custodian on the chemical industry |journal=[[Ind.

In 1929, [[H. K. Mulford Company]] merged with Sharp and Dohme, Inc. This company brought to the future Merck & Co, Inc vaccine technology, including immunization of cavalry horses in World War I and delivery of a diphtheria antitoxin in 1925.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merck.com/about/our-history/timeline/index.html|title=Our History|accessdate=7 Aug 2014}}</ref>

===1950 to 2000===

In 1953, Merck & Co. merged with Philadelphia-based Sharp & Dohme, Inc., founded by Alpheus Phineas Sharp and Carl Friedrich Louis Dohme in 1845, becoming the largest US drugmaker.<ref>Time Magazine: [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,935871,00.html Merck's Merger], March 16, 1953.

The combined company kept the trade name Merck in the United States and Canada, and as Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) outside North America. In 1965 Merck & Co. acquired [[Charles Frosst|Charles E. Frosst]] Ltd. of [[Montreal]], [[Canada]] (founded 1899) and created Merck-Frosst Canada, Inc., as its Canadian subsidiary and pharmaceutical research facility. Merck & Co. closed this facility in July 2010,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/business/article/833712--montreal-plant-among-17-closed-by-drugmaker-merck | location=Toronto | work=The Star | title=Montreal plant among 17 closed by drugmaker Merck | date=July 8, 2010}}</ref> and the company was renamed '''Merck Canada''' in 2011.

==="Merck" name legal dispute===
In 191 of 193 countries the original Merck company, the [[Merck Group]] of Darmstadt, owns the rights to the "Merck" name. In the United States and Canada the company trades under the name EMD (an abbreviation of Emanuel Merck, Darmstadt). In the United States and Canada Merck & Co. holds the rights to the trademark "Merck", while in the rest of the world the company trades under the name MSD (an abbreviation of Merck, Sharp & Dohme).

In 2015 the [[Merck Group]] adopted a new logo and said it will be "much more aggressive" about protecting the brand of "the real Merck."<ref name="Bloomberg14">[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-10/a-tale-of-two-mercks-as-protesters-take-on-wrong-company A Tale of Two Mercks as Protesters Take On Wrong Company], Bloomberg</ref> Merck of Darmstadt has initiated litigation against its former subsidiary, Merck & Co. (MSD) of Kenilworth, in several countries over infringing use of the Merck name. In 2016, the [[High Court of Justice]] in the [[United Kingdom]] ruled that MSD had breached an agreement with its former parent company and that only Merck of Darmstadt is entitled to use the Merck name in the United Kingdom.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-merckkgaa-name-idUSKCN0UT239 Fight over Merck name sees German firm win in British court], Reuters</ref> The judge also held that MSD's use of "Merck" as part of branding on its global websites were directed to the UK and infringed Merck's trade mark rights in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/article/merck-kgaa-announces-favorable-english-court-ruling-on-name-use-20160115-00359#ixzz41CPkGqNI|title=Today's Stock Market News and Analysis from Nasdaq.com|publisher=}}</ref>

In response to the ruling, MSD initiated counter-litigation in the United States in January 2016 by filing a federal lawsuit which accused its former parent company of "infringing on its trademark" through actions that included the increased usage of “Merck KGaA” and “MERCK” in branding in the US as well as on its social media presence. Further Merck & Co. has also accused the Merck Group of federal trademark dilution, unfair competition, false advertising, deceptive trade practices, breach of contract, and [[cybersquatting]]. The case came to a head when a research scientist believed he was communicating with Merck & Co regarding a research grant in oncology, when in fact they were talking with the Merck Group. As a result, Merck & Co. asked the federal court to stop the Merck Group from using “Merck” on any products or marketing materials in the United States. As a direct result, Merck & Co is seeking “''all monetary gains, profits, and advantages''” made by the Merck Group and three-times the damage, plus additional punitive damages.<ref name="genengnews.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/legal-wrangle-pits-merck-vs-merck/81252246/|title=Legal Wrangle Pits Merck vs. Merck|work=GEN}}</ref>

* [[Januvia]] (sitagliptin), a dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.  In 2013, Januvia was the second largest selling diabetes drug worldwide,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fiercepharma.com/special-reports/the-top-10-best-selling-diabetes-drugs-2013 |title=The top 10 best-selling diabetes drugs of 2013 - FiercePharma |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> with $4.0 billion in worldwide sales.  Januvia is commonly paired with the generic anti-diabetes drug [[metformin]].

* [[Zetia]] (ezetimibe) is a drug for hypercholesterolemia that acts by inhibiting the absorption of dietary cholesterol.  Sales in 2013 amounted to $2.7 billion.  Zetia has been controversial, as it was initially approved based on its impact on serum cholesterol levels without proof that it actually impacted the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Results of the IMPROVE-IT study, however, introduced at the 2014 Scientific Sessions of the American Heart Association, showed a statistically significant, albeit modest, benefit in adding Zetia to simvastatin for high-risk, post-acute-coronary-syndrome patients.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCoverage/AHA/48637 | work=MedpageToday | title=AHA: IMPROVE-IT Proves Ezetimibe Benefit | date=November 17, 2014}}</ref>

====Antibacterials====
Streptomycin, discovered during a Merck-funded research program in Selman Waksman's laboratory at Rutgers in 1943, became the first effective treatment for tuberculosis.  At the time of its discovery, sanitoriums for the isolation of tuberculosis-infected people were a ubiquitous feature of cities in developed countries, with 50% dying within 5 years of admission.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Kingston W |title=Streptomycin, Schatz v.

In 1985 Merck received approval for [[imipenem]], the first member of the [[carbapenem]] class of antibiotics. Antibiotics of the carbapenem class play an important role in treatment guidelines for certain hospital-acquired and multi-drug resistant infections.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/50/2/133.full.pdf+html |title=Diagnosis and Management of Complicated Intra-abdominal Infection in Adults and Children: Guidelines by the Surgical Infection Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America |work= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.idsociety.org/uploadedFiles/IDSA/Guidelines-Patient_Care/PDF_Library/HAP.pdf |title=www.idsociety.org |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

====Vioxx====
In 1999, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved Vioxx (known generically as [[rofecoxib]]), a Merck product for treating [[arthritis]].  Vioxx was designed as a selective inhibitor of the enzyme [[cyclooxygenase-2]]. Such compounds were expected to cause less gastrointestinal bleeding than older [[anti-inflammatory]] drugs such as [[naproxen]], which were associated with 20,000 hospitalizations and 2000 deaths each year.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fries JF, Miller SR, Spitz PW, Williams CA, Hubert HB, Bloch DA |title=Toward an epidemiology of gastropathy associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=96 |issue=2 Pt 2 Suppl |pages=647–55 | date=February  1989 |pmid=2909442 |doi= 10.1016/S0016-5085(89)80061-7}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=November 2015}}  Vioxx became one of the most prescribed drugs in history.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Thereafter, studies by Merck and by others found an increased risk of heart attack associated with [[Vioxx]] use when compared with naproxen. Merck adjusted the labeling of Vioxx to reflect possible cardiovascular risks in 2002.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

On September 23, 2004, Merck received information about results from a [[clinical trial]] it was conducting that included findings of increased risk of heart attacks among Vioxx users who had been using the medication for over eighteen months.<ref>[http://finance.senate.gov/press/Gpress/2004/prg101504.pdf Finance.senate.gov] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041029135457/http://finance.senate.gov/press/Gpress/2004/prg101504.pdf |date=October 29, 2004 }}</ref>  On September 28, 2004, Merck notified the FDA that it was voluntarily withdrawing Vioxx from the market, and it publicly announced the withdrawal on September 30. An analysis for the period 1999-2004, based on U.S. Medical Expenditure Survey data, reported that Vioxx was associated with 46,783 heart attacks, and along with the other popular [[COX-2 inhibitor]] [[Celebrex]], an estimated 26,603 deaths from both.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Vaithianathan R, Hockey PM, Moore TJ, Bates DW |title=Iatrogenic effects of COX-2 inhibitors in the US population: findings from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey |journal=Drug Saf |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=335–43 |year=2009 |pmid=19388724 |doi= 10.2165/00002018-200932040-00007|url=}}</ref>

About 50,000 people sued Merck, claiming they or their family members had suffered medical problems such as heart attacks or strokes after taking Vioxx.<ref name="NYT">[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/30/business/30drug.html?_r=1&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&oref=slogin Courts Reject Two Major Vioxx Verdicts], ''[[The New York Times]], May 30, 2008</ref> In November 2007, Merck agreed to pay $4.85 billion to settle most of the pending Vioxx lawsuits.<ref name="NYT2">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/09/business/09cnd-merck.html | work=The New York Times | title=Merck Agrees to Pay $4.85 Billion in Vioxx Claims | date=November 9, 2007}}</ref> The settlement required that claimants provide medical and pharmacy records confirming the occurrence of a heart attack, ischemic stroke, or sudden cardiac death; the receipt of at least 30 Vioxx pills within 60 days prior to the injury or death; and confirmation of Vioxx being used within 14 days of the Vioxx-related event.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.officialvioxxsettlement.com/documents/Description%20of%20Settlement.pdf | work=Vioxx MDL Plaintiffs’ Steering Committee Official Vioxx Settlement | title=Description of Settlement Agreement | date=November 9, 2007}}</ref>  The settlement was generally viewed by industry analysts and investors as a victory for Merck, considering that original estimates of Merck's liability reached between $10 billion and $25 billion.<ref name="NYT2"/> In fact, as of mid-2008, when the plaintiff class had reached the threshold percentage required by Merck to go through with the settlement, plaintiffs had prevailed in only three of the twenty cases that had reached juries, all with relatively small awards.<ref name="NYT"/>

According to internal e-mail traffic released at a later lawsuit, Merck had a list of doctors critical of Vioxx to be "neutralized" or "discredited." "We may need to seek them out and destroy them where they live," wrote an employee. A Stanford Medical School professor said that Merck was engaged in intimidation of researchers and infringement upon [[academic freedom]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/drug-company-drew-up-doctor-hit-list/story-fna7dq6e-1225693586492 |title=Vioxx maker Merck and Co drew up doctor hit list |last=Rout |first=Milanda |work=The Australian |date=April 1, 2009 |accessdate=2009-04-26}}</ref>

In 1987, Merck & Co. began a program with [[UNICEF]] to donate its new drug [[Mectizan]] to "all that need it for as long as needed"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unicefusa.org/news/news-from-the-field/merck-pia.html |title=Stories of UNICEF in Action » - UNICEF USA |work=UNICEF USA |accessdate=3 July 2015 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426154146/http://www.unicefusa.org/news/news-from-the-field/merck-pia.html |archivedate=26 April 2012 |df= }}</ref> in an effort to combat [[onchocerciasis]], also known as river blindness, primarily in Africa. Up to that point, the [[World Health Organization]] had fought the disease through the use of insecticides to lower the population of its primary vector, the [[Black Fly]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/class/humbio103/ParaSites2005/Ivermectin/History.htm |title=Ivermectin History |publisher=Stanford.edu |date=February 24, 1981 |accessdate=2012-06-05}}</ref> However, when studies in the 1980s showed how effective the drug was at treating and preventing the disease, the WHO agreed to use it instead of its previous strategies. Merck's involvement is considered a key factor in the success against the disease all over the world,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110830090427/http://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/vol17no1/171heal1.htm Onchocerciasis: Africa's victory over river blindness], Africa Recovery, Vol. 17 No. 1 (May 2003), p. 6</ref> and the decision to donate the entirety of the drug to all those in need of it is used as part of the Mectizan Donation Program that covers countries such as Yemen and in African countries.<ref name="Mectizan Donation Program">{{cite web|url=http://www.mectizan.org/history|title=History|publisher=|accessdate=3 July 2015}}</ref>

More than 700 million people have been treated since the inception of the program with 80 million people still undergoing treatment in Africa, Latin America, and Yemen.

===Mass retrenchment===
As of January 2015, 30000 people have been forced to leave the company due to economic reasons. Singapore's branch has been the most affected.

===Sham medical journal===
From 2002 through 2005 the Australian affiliate of Merck paid [[Elsevier]] an undisclosed amount to publish eight issues of a medical journal, the ''[[Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine]]''. Although it gave the appearance of being an independent peer-reviewed journal, without any indication that Merck had paid for it, the journal actually reprinted articles that originally appeared in other publications and that were favorable to Merck. The misleading publication came to light in 2009 during a personal injury lawsuit filed over Vioxx; 9 of 29 articles in the journal's second issue referred positively to Vioxx.<ref>{{cite news |author= Singer N |title= Merck paid for medical 'journal' without disclosure |work= The New York Times |date=May 13, 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/14/business/14vioxxside.html |accessdate=2009-06-17}}</ref> In 2009, the CEO of Elsevier's Health Sciences Division, Michael Hansen, admitted that the practice was "unacceptable".<ref>{{cite press release | title = Statement From Michael Hansen, CEO Of Elsevier's Health Sciences Division, Regarding Australia Based Sponsored Journal Practices Between 2000 And 2005  | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | date = May 7, 2009 | url = http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/authored_newsitem.cws_home/companynews05_01203 | accessdate = November 20, 2009 | quote = It has recently come to my attention that from 2000 to 2005, our Australia office published a series of sponsored article compilation publications, on behalf of pharmaceutical clients, that were made to look like journals and lacked the proper disclosures.

===Medicaid overbilling===
A US Justice Department fraud investigation began in 2000 when allegations were brought in two separate lawsuits filed by whistleblowers under the [[False Claims Act]].<ref name="wapo"/> They alleged that Merck failed to pay proper rebates to [[Medicaid]] and other health care programs and paid illegal remuneration to health care providers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2008/February/08_civ_094.html |title=Merck to Pay More than $650 Million to Resolve Claims of Fraudulent Price Reporting and Kickbacks|publisher=US Department of Justice|date=February 7, 2008 |accessdate=2012-06-05}}</ref> On February 7, 2008 Merck agreed to pay more than $650 million to settle charges that it routinely overbilled Medicaid for its most popular medicines. The settlement was one of the [[List of Largest Pharmaceutical Settlements|largest pharmaceutical settlements]] in history.

===Environmental record===
Merck & Co. once used [[methylene chloride]], an animal carcinogen on the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s list of pollutants, as a solvent in some of its manufacturing processes. Merck chemists and engineers subsequently replaced the compound with others having fewer negative environmental effects. Merck has also modified its equipment to protect the environment, installing a distributed control system that coordinates chemical reactions more efficiently and expedites manufacturing by 50 percent, eliminating the need for the disposal and storage of harmful waste. Biological oxygen demand has also been reduced.<ref>http://www.p2pays.org/ref%5C01/00155.pdf</ref>

In 1991, Merck's Kelco subsidiary was responsible for [[volatile organic compound]] (VOC) emission pollution in the San Diego area. In 1996 Merck paid $1.8 million for polluting the air. New machines were installed to reduce smog emissions by {{convert|680000|lb|abbr=on}} a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/016bcfb1deb9fecd85256aca005d74df/e96f05f182d3254b852570d8005e1207!OpenDocument |title=U.S. settles $1.8 million pollution case with Merck and Monsanto &#124; US EPA |publisher=Yosemite.epa.gov |accessdate=2012-06-05}}</ref>
