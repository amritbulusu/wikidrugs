'''Afamelanotide''' ('''melanotan I''', '''CUV1647'''; brand name '''Scenesse''')<ref>{{cite web|title=Afamelanotide|url=http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800004283|publisher=AdisInsight|accessdate=6 April 2017|language=en}}</ref> is a [[peptide synthesis|synthetic]] [[peptide]] and [[structural analog|analogue]] of [[α-melanocyte stimulating hormone]] used to prevent skin damage from the sun in people with [[erythropoietic protoporphyria]].   It is administered as an implant that is placed under the skin; the implant lasts for two months. 

It is under development in other skin disorders in several jurisdictions.  It causes skin to turn darker by causing the skin to make more [[melanin]]. 

It was [[drug discovery|discovered]] at University of Arizona and initially [[drug development|developed]] there as a [[sunless tanning]] agent; the Australian company Clinuvel conducted further clinical trials in that and other indications, and brought the drug to market. 

Unlicensed and untested powders sold as "melanotan" are found on the Internet marketed for tanning and other purposes, and multiple regulatory bodies have warned consumers that the peptides may be unsafe and ineffective.

==Medical use==
Afamelanotide is used in Europe to prevent [[phototoxicity]] in adults with [[erythropoietic protoporphyria]].<ref name=EMA2017>{{cite web|title=Scenesse: Summary of Product Characteristics|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Product_Information/human/002548/WC500182307.pdf|publisher=EMA|date=27 January 2016|accessdate=6 April 2017}} For updates see [http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/002548/human_med_001826.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d124 EMA Index page]</ref>  It is an implant that is injected and placed under the skin; an implant lasts two months.<ref name=EMA2017/>

People who have severe liver disease, liver impairment, or kidney impairment, should not use this drug.  Pregnant women should not take it, and women who are active sexually should use contraception while they are taking it.  It is not known if afamelanotide is secreted in breast milk.<ref name=EMA2017/>

==Adverse effects==
Very common (up to 10% of people) adverse effects in people with EPP include headache and nausea.  Common (between 1% and 10%) adverse effects include back pain, upper respiratory tract infections, decreased appetite, migraine, dizziness, weakness, fatigue, lethargy, sleepiness, feeling hot, stomach pain, diarrhea, vomiting, flushing and red skin, development of warts, spots, and freckles, itchy skin, and reactions at the injection site.  There are many uncommon (less than 1%) adverse effects.<ref name=EMA2017/>

==Pharmacology==
Afamelanotide is thought to cause skin to darken by binding to the [[melanocortin 1 receptor]] which in turn drives [[Melanocyte#Melanogenesis|melanogenesis]].<ref name=EMA2017/>

Afamelanotide has a half-life of 30 minutes.  After the implant is injected, most of the drug is released within the first 2 days, with 90% released by the fifth day. By the tenth day no drug is detectable in plasma.<ref name=EMA2017/>

Its metabolites, distribution, metabolism and excretion were not understood as of 2017.<ref name=EMA2017/>

==Chemistry==
The [[Peptide sequence|amino acid sequence]] is Ac-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Nle-Glu-His-<small>D</small>-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val-NH<sub>2</sub>, and it is additionally known as [Nle<sup>4</sup>,<small>D</small>-Phe<sup>7</sup>]-α-MSH, which is sometimes abbreviated as NDP-MSH or NDP-α-MSH.  Afamelanotide is the [[International Nonproprietary Name]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/druginformation/innlists/PL100prepubli.pdf|title=International Nonproprietary Names for Pharmaceutical Substances (INN)|accessdate=2009-03-02|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|year=2009|format=[[PDF]]}}</ref>

==History==
The role of α-MSH in promoting melanin diffusion has been known since the 1960s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=BI|title=The role of melanin-concentrating hormone in color change.|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=31 May 1993|volume=680|pages=279-89|pmid=8390154}}</ref> In the 1980s, scientists at University of Arizona began attempting to develop α-MSH and analogs as potential [[sunless tanning]] agents, and synthesized and tested several analogs, including melanotan-I.<ref name=HadleyDorr2006/>

To pursue the tanning agent, melanotan-I was licensed by Competitive Technologies, a [[technology transfer]] company operating on behalf of University of Arizona, to an Australian startup called Epitan,<ref name=PL2004>{{cite news|title=EpiTan focuses on Melanotan, a potential blockbuster|url=https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/epitan-focuses-on-melanotan-a-potential-blockbuster|work=The Pharma Letter|date=1 November 2004|language=en}}</ref><ref name=HadleyDorr2006>{{cite journal|last1=Hadley|first1=ME|last2=Dorr|first2=RT|title=Melanocortin peptide therapeutics: historical milestones, clinical studies and commercialization.|journal=Peptides|date=April 2006|volume=27|issue=4|pages=921-30|doi=10.1016/j.peptides.2005.01.029|pmid=16412534}}</ref> which changed its name to Clinuvel in 2006.<ref>{{cite news|title=Epitan changes name to Clinuvel, announces new clinical program|url=http://www.labonline.com.au/content/life-scientist/news/epitan-changes-name-to-clinuvel-announces-new-clinical-program-161764385|work=LabOnline|date=27 February 2006|language=en}}</ref>

Early clinical trials showed that the peptide had to be injected about ten times a day due to its short half-life, so the company collaborated with [[Southern Research]] in the US to develop a [[Injection_(medicine)#Depot_injection|depot formulation]] that would be injected under the skin, and release the peptide slowly. This was done by 2004.<ref name=PL2004/>

As of 2010, afamelanotide was in Phase III trials for [[erythropoietic protoporphyria]] and [[polymorphous light eruption]], and was in Phase II trials for [[actinic keratosis]] and [[squamous cell carcinoma]], and had been trialled in [[phototoxicity]] associated with [[Biological system|systemic]] [[photodynamic therapy]] and [[solar urticaria]].<ref name=2010status>{{cite news|last1=Dean|first1=Tim|title=Biotechnology profile: Bright future for Clinuvel (ASX:CUV)|url=http://www.labonline.com.au/content/life-scientist/news/biotechnology-profile-bright-future-for-clinuvel-asx-cuv--837406981|work=Australian Life Scientist|date=3 May 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406064959/http://www.labonline.com.au/content/life-scientist/news/biotechnology-profile-bright-future-for-clinuvel-asx-cuv--837406981|archivedate=6 April 2017|language=en}}</ref> Clinuvel had also obtained [[orphan drug]] status for afamelanotide in the US and the EU by that time.<ref name=2010status/>

In May 2010 the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA, or Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco) approved afamelanotide as a treatment for [[erythropoietic protoporphyria]].<ref name="GU">{{Cite news|url=http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/rubriche/gazzettaufficiale/2010/05/17/visualizza_new.html_1793113900.html|title=GAZZETTA UFFICIALE: SOMMARIO|accessdate=2010-05-17|publisher=[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata]]|year=2010}}</ref>

In January 2015 afamelanotide was approved by the EMA in Europe for the treatment of phototoxicity in people with EPP.<ref name=EMA2017/>

Afamelanotide is currently being trialed in the form of a "grain of rice"-sized bioabsorbable subcutaneous implant as a potential [[therapy|therapeutic]] [[photoprotection]]-inducing agent for a series of [[light]]-related [[human skin|skin]] [[indication (medicine)|indications]] as well as a potential dermal repigmentation agent for [[vitiligo]].
