'''Cefepime''' is a fourth-generation [[cephalosporin]] [[antibiotic]]. Cefepime has an extended spectrum of activity against [[Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative]] [[bacteria]], with greater activity against both types of organism than third-generation agents.

A 2007 [[meta-analysis]] suggested when data of trials were combined, [[Mortality rate|mortality]] was increased in people treated with cefepime compared with other β-lactam antibiotics.<ref name="pmid17448937">{{cite journal |vauthors=Yahav D, Paul M, Fraser A, Sarid N, Leibovici L |title=Efficacy and safety of cefepime: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Lancet Infect Dis |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=338–48 |year=2007 |pmid=17448937 |doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(07)70109-3}}</ref> In response, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] performed their own meta-analysis which found no mortality difference.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/DrugSafetyInformationforHeathcareProfessionals/ucm167254.htm|title=Information for Healthcare Professionals: Cefepime (marketed as Maxipime) |accessdate=2009-08-02 |work=}}</ref>

Cefepime was developed by [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]]<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Barbhaiya RH, Forgue ST, Gleason CR, Knupp CA, Pittman KA, Weidler DJ, Martin RR |title=Safety, tolerance, and pharmacokinetic evaluation of cefepime after administration of single intravenous doses |journal=Antimicrob.

It is now available as a generic drug and sold under a variety of trade names worldwide.

== Medical use ==
Cefepime is usually reserved to treat moderate to severe [[nosocomial]] [[pneumonia]], infections caused by multiple drug-resistant microorganisms (e.g. ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'') and [[empirical]] treatment of [[febrile]] [[neutropenia]].<ref name="pmid14720024">{{cite journal |vauthors=Chapman TM, Perry CM |title=Cefepime: a review of its use in the management of hospitalized patients with pneumonia |journal=Am J Respir Med |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=75–107 |year=2003 |pmid=14720024 |doi=10.1007/bf03256641}}</ref>

Cefepime has good activity against important pathogens including ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'', ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', and multiple drug-resistant ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]''. A particular strength is its activity against [[Enterobacteriaceae]]. Whereas other cephalosporins are degraded by many [[plasmid]]- and [[chromosome]]-mediated [[beta-lactamase]]s, cefepime is stable and is a front-line agent when infection with Enterobacteriaceae is known or suspected.

===Spectrum of bacterial susceptibility===
Cefepime is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic and has been used to treat bacteria responsible for causing pneumonia and infections of the skin and urinary tract. Some of these bacteria include ''Pseudomonas'', ''Escherichia'', and ''Streptococcus'' species. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant microorganisms.
* ''Escherichia coli'': ≤0.007 – 128 μg/ml
* ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'': 0.06 – >256 μg/ml
* ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'': ≤0.007  – >8 μg/ml

== Chemistry ==
The combination of the ''syn''-configuration of the [[methoxy]][[imino]] [[Moiety (chemistry)|moiety]] and the [[aminothiazol]]yl moiety confers extra stability to [[beta lactamase|&beta;-lactamase]] enzymes produced by many bacteria.  The ''N''-[[methyl]][[pyrrolidine]] moiety increases penetration into Gram-negative bacteria. These factors increase the activity of cefepime against otherwise resistant organisms including ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' and ''Staphylococcus aureus''.

==Trade names==
Following expiration of the Bristol-Myers Squibb patent, cefepime became available as a generic and is now marketed by numerous companies worldwide under tradenames including Neopime (Neomed), Maxipime, Cepimax, Cepimex, and Axepim.
