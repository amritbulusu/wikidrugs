==Medical uses==
Hydroxycarbamide is used for the following indications:

Due to its negative effect on the bone marrow, regular monitoring of the [[full blood count]] is vital, as well as early response to possible infections. In addition, [[renal function]], [[uric acid]] and [[electrolytes]], as well as [[liver enzyme]]s, are commonly checked.<ref name="gale">{{Cite book|last=Longe |first=Jacqueline L. |title=Gale Encyclopedia Of Cancer: A Guide To Cancer And Its Treatments |publisher=Thomson Gale |location=Detroit |year=2002 |pages=514–516 |isbn=978-1-4144-0362-5}}</ref> Moreover, because of this, severe [[anemia]] and [[neutropenia]] are contraindicated.

Hydroxycarbamide has been used primarily for the treatment of myeloproliferative diseases, which has an inherent risk of transforming to [[acute myeloid leukemia]]. There has been a longstanding concern that hydroxycarbamide itself carries a leukemia risk, but large studies have shown that the risk is either absent or very small. Nevertheless, it has been a barrier for its wider use in patients with sickle-cell disease.<ref name=Platt2008/>

==Mechanism of action==
Hydroxycarbamide decreases the production of [[deoxyribonucleotide]]s<ref>{{DorlandsDict|four/000050608|hydroxyurea}}</ref> via inhibition of the enzyme [[ribonucleotide reductase]] by scavenging tyrosyl free radicals as they are involved in the reduction of nucleoside diphosphates (NDPs).<ref name=Platt2008>{{cite journal |author=Platt OS |title=Hydroxyurea for the treatment of sickle cell anemia |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=358 |issue=13 |pages=1362–9 |year=2008 |pmid=18367739 |doi=10.1056/NEJMct0708272}}</ref>

In the treatment of [[sickle-cell disease]], hydroxycarbamide increases the concentration of [[fetal hemoglobin]]. The precise mechanism of action is not yet clear, but it appears that hydroxycarbamide increases [[nitric oxide]] levels, causing soluble [[guanylyl cyclase]] activation with a resultant rise in [[cyclic GMP]], and the activation of gamma globin gene expression and subsequent gamma chain synthesis necessary for [[fetal hemoglobin]] (HbF) production (which does not polymerize and deform red blood cells like the mutated HbS, responsible for sickle cell disease). Adult red cells containing more than 1% HbF are termed F cells. These cells are progeny of a small pool of immature committed erythroid precursors (BFU-e) that retain the ability to produce HbF. Hydroxyurea also suppresses the production of granulocytes in the bone marrow which has a mild immunosuppressive effect particularly at vascular sites where sickle cells have occluded blood flow.<ref name=Platt2008/><ref name="pmid12531879">{{cite journal |vauthors=Cokic VP, Smith RD, Beleslin-Cokic BB, etal |title=Hydroxyurea induces fetal hemoglobin by the nitric oxide-dependent activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase |journal=J Clin Invest |volume=111 |issue=2 |pages=231–9 |year=2003 |pmid=12531879 |doi=10.1172/JCI16672 |url=http://www.jci.org/articles/view/16672 |pmc=151872 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115015958/http://www.jci.org/articles/view/16672 |archivedate=2009-01-15 |df= }}</ref>

==Chemistry==
Hydroxyurea has been prepared in many different ways since its initial synthesis in 1869.<ref name="Dresler and Stein et al 1869">{{cite journal| title=Ueber den Hydroxylharnstoff|author1=Dresler WFC|author2= Stein R|year=1869|journal=Justus Liebigs Ann Chemie 150:1317–22}}</ref> Medical chemists, Dresler and Stein created Hydroxyurea from hydroxylamine, hydrochloric acid and potassium cyanide as a technical exercise in organic chemistry, as part of a series of experiments generating derivatives of urea. Hydroxyurea lay dormant for more than fifty years until it was studied as part of an investigation into the toxicity of protein metabolites.<ref name=PMC3069221">{{cite journal|title=The rationale for using hydroxycarbamide in the treatment of sickle cell disease|author=Rees C.

==Pharmacology==
Hydroxyurea is a monohydroxyl-substituted urea (hydroxycarbamate) [[antimetabolite]]. Similar to other antimetabolite anti-cancer drugs, it acts by disrupting the DNA replication process of dividing cancer cells in the body. Hydroxyurea selectively inhibits [[ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase]], an enzyme required to convert ribonucleoside diphosphates into deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates, thereby preventing cells from leaving the G1/S phase of the cell cycle. This agent also exhibits radiosensitizing activity by maintaining cells in the radiation-sensitive G1 phase and interfering with DNA repair.<ref name=pubchem>{{cite website|title=Pharmacology and Biochemistry|journal=PubChem|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/hydroxyurea#section=Prescription-Drug-Products|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518234727/https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/hydroxyurea#section=Prescription-Drug-Products|archivedate=2017-05-18|df=}}</ref>
