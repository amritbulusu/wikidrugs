'''Benzonatate''', marketed under the trade names '''Tessalon''' and '''Tessalon Perles''' among others, is a non-[[narcotic]] oral cough suppressant, or ''[[antitussive]]'', with effects that last from 6 to 8 hours. Since it is not an opioid, benzonatate is not as prone to abuse like some other cough medications such as [[codeine]]. Benzonatate was approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1958.<ref name=MedicineNet>MedicineNet.com: [http://www.medicinenet.com/benzonatate/article.htm Benzonatate]</ref>

==Chemical structure==
Benzonatate is a [[N-Butylamine|butylamine]], chemically related to other [[ester]] local anesthetics such as [[procaine]] and [[tetracaine]]. 

==Pharmacologic mechanisms of action==
Benzonatate is thought to act as a local anesthetic, decreasing the sensitivity of [[Mechanoreceptors|stretch receptors]] in the lower airway and lung, thereby reducing the drive to cough after taking a deep breath.<ref name=MedicaLook>Medicalook.com: [http://www.medicalook.com/reviews/Benzonatate.html Benzonatate]</ref>

==Indications==
An antitussive, benzonatate is employed to reduce coughing in various respiratory conditions such as bronchitis, emphysema, influenza, and pneumonia.<ref name="MedicaLook"/>  It should never be used to suppress a productive cough producing mucus that can be spit out, or in place of treatment of the actual cause of cough, such as asthma treatment.{{medcn|date=December 2013}}

It has been used in small doses as a topical anesthetic for mouth or pharyngeal pain. This practice is not recommended, because the oropharyngeal anesthesia may result in [[pulmonary aspiration]].<ref>Medline Plus: [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682640.html Benzonatate]</ref>

Noted beneficial side-effect is the reduction or quieting of chronic snoring.{{medcn|date=March 2014}}

==Dosage and administration==
[[File:100mg_generic_Benzonatate_Capsules.jpg|thumb|left|alt=100mg generic Benzonatate capsules.|100mg generic Benzonatate capsules.]]Benzonatate is sold as yellow or blue 100&nbsp;mg and 200&nbsp;mg softgel capsules. Initial dose is one 100&nbsp;mg perle (gelcap) by mouth, 3 times a day. Dosage may be increased as necessary, up to a maximum of 600&nbsp;mg per day.<ref name=MedicineNet />

Due to its potency and potential toxicity, the capsules must be swallowed intact in order to allow slower release of the medication.

==Adverse reactions==
Reported side effects include drowsiness, dizziness, and [[dysphagia]].  There are reports of death related to overdose of benzonatate, mostly in children.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/archives/fdaDrugInfo.cfm?archiveid=51947 | title = Benzonatate}}</ref>

[[Para-aminobenzoic acid]] (PABA) is a [[metabolite]] of the ester class of local anesthetics, which includes benzonatate, as well as [[procaine]] and [[tetracaine]]. Severe allergic reactions have been reported in patients who are allergic to PABA. Severe sensitivity reactions to benzonatate have resulted in respiratory side effects such as [[bronchospasm]], [[laryngospasm]] and [[cardiac arrest]].<ref>{{Cite journal

Excessive absorption of benzonatate (a local anesthetic) in the oral mucosa will result in the rapid development of numbness of the mouth and throat. In extreme cases, the mouth and pharynx may become so numb that [[pulmonary aspiration]] may occur. 

Excessive absorption of benzonatate will occur if the gelcaps are chewed or allowed to dissolve in the mouth. This may lead to an overdose of the drug. Overdose of benzonatate may manifest as central nervous system side effects, such as mental confusion and hallucination, restlessness and tremors,{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} followed in extreme cases by convulsions and death.<ref>{{Cite journal
