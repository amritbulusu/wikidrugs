==Medical uses==
Terbinafine is mainly effective on the [[dermatophyte]] group of fungi.

As a cream or powder, it is used [[Topical medication|topically]] for superficial skin infections such as [[jock itch]] (tinea cruris), [[athlete's foot]] (tinea pedis), and other types of [[ringworm]] (tinea corporis).  Terbinafine cream works in about half the time required by other antifungals.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Markova T | title = Clinical inquiries. What is the most effective treatment for tinea pedis (athlete's foot)? | journal = The Journal of Family Practice | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–22 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11927056 | url = http://www.jfponline.com/Pages.asp?AID=1080 | publisher = Frontline Medical Communications | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120406092510/http://www.jfponline.com/Pages.asp?AID=1080 | archivedate = 2012-04-06 | df =  }}</ref>

[[Tablet (pharmacy)|Tablets]] by mouth are often prescribed for the treatment of [[onychomycosis]], a fungal nail infection, typically by a dermatophyte or ''[[Candida (fungus)|Candida]]'' species. Fungal nail infections are located deep under the nail in the [[cuticle]] to which topically applied treatments are unable to penetrate in sufficient amounts. The tablets may, rarely, cause [[hepatotoxicity]], so patients are warned of this and may be monitored with [[liver function tests]]. Alternatives to by mouth administration have been studied. 

Terbinafine hydrochloride may induce or exacerbate [[subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus]]. Persons with [[lupus erythematosus]] should first discuss possible risks with their doctor before initiation of therapy.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Callen JP, Hughes AP, Kulp-Shorten C | title = Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus induced or exacerbated by terbinafine: a report of 5 cases | journal = Archives of Dermatology | volume = 137 | issue = 9 | pages = 1196–8 | date = September 2001 | pmid = 11559217 | doi = 10.1001/archderm.137.9.1196 }}</ref>

===FDA approval===

Terbinafine first became available in Europe in 1991 and in the United States in 1996. The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] has approved the first generic versions of prescription Lamisil (terbinafine hydrochloride) tablets.  The remaining patent or exclusivity for Lamisil expired on June 30, 2007.

On September 28, 2007, the FDA stated that terbinafine is a new [[therapy|treatment]] approved for use by [[children]] age four and up. The [[Antifungal medication|antifungal]] [[:wikt:granule|granules]] can be sprinkled on a child's food to treat [[ringworm]] of the scalp, [[tinea capitis]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/governmentFilingsNews/idUSN2820532120070928 |work=Reuters |title=US FDA approves oral granules for scalp ringworm |date=2007-09-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323125943/http://www.reuters.com/article/governmentFilingsNews/idUSN2820532120070928 |archivedate=2009-03-23 |df= }}</ref>

* Psychological problems: [[Depression (mood)|Depression]], [[anxiety]], [[insomnia]], increased or unusual [[dream]] activity, [[malaise]]
* Sensory problems: Complete loss of taste ([[ageusia]]), decreased taste ([[hypogeusia]]) and distorted taste ([[dysgeusia]]), often involving a metallic taste sensation and dry mouth, visual disturbances including blurred vision, green vision and double vision.

In 2015 physicians reported<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Trachtman JN, Pagano V | title = Antifolates and MTHFR | journal = Therapeutic Drug Monitoring | volume = 37 | issue = 6 | pages = 697–8 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 25929315 | doi = 10.1097/FTD.0000000000000215 }}</ref> that a patient with an [[MTHFR]] enzyme mutation (specifically the [[C677T]] variant) had developed an adverse reaction to Lamisil (headache, fatigue, and dizziness). Genetic testing revealed the MTHFR C677T mutation. It was noted that Lamisil interferes with the methylation cycle and that this can cause side effects in individuals with the MTHFR C677T mutation.

==Pharmacology==
[[File:Terbinafine hydrochloride pills.jpg|thumb|Generic terbinafine hydrochloride pills]]
Terbinafine [[hydrochloride]] is a white fine crystalline powder that is freely soluble in [[methanol]] and [[dichloromethane]], soluble in [[ethanol]], and slightly soluble in water. It is highly [[hydrophobic]] and tends to accumulate in [[hair]], skin, [[Nail (anatomy)|nails]], and [[adipose tissue|fatty tissue]].

Like other allylamines, terbinafine inhibits [[ergosterol]] synthesis by inhibiting [[squalene epoxidase]], an enzyme that is part of the fungal [[cell membrane]] synthesis pathway. Because terbinafine prevents conversion of [[squalene]] to [[lanosterol]], [[ergosterol]] cannot be synthesized. This is thought to change cell membrane permeability, causing fungal cell [[lysis]].
