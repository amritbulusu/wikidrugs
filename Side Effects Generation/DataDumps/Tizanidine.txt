'''Tizanidine''' (trade names '''Zanaflex''' ([[Acorda Therapeutics]]), '''Sirdalud''' ([[Novartis]]), '''Relentus''' ([[Beximco Pharma]]) <nowiki/>Is a centrally acting α<sub>2</sub> [[adrenergic agonist]] used as a [[muscle relaxant]]. It is used to treat the [[spasm]]s, [[cramp]]ing, and tightness of [[muscle]]s caused by medical problems such as [[multiple sclerosis]], [[ALS]], [[spastic diplegia]], [[back pain]], or certain other injuries to the [[vertebral column|spine]] or [[central nervous system]]. It is also prescribed off-label for [[migraine]] [[headache]]s, as a [[sleep aid]], and as an [[anticonvulsant]]. It is also prescribed for some symptoms of [[fibromyalgia]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.fibromyalgia-reviews.com/Drg_Zanaflex.cfm |title = Zanaflex for Fibromyalgia |author =  |date =  |website = www.fibromyalgia-reviews.com |accessdate = 4 September 2017 }}</ref>

Tizanidine has been found to be as effective as other antispasmodic drugs and is more tolerable than [[baclofen]] and [[diazepam]].<ref name="Kamen-2008">{{Cite journal |last1 = Kamen |first1 = L. |last2 = Henney |first2 = HR. |last3 = Runyan |first3 = JD. |title = A practical overview of tizanidine use for spasticity secondary to multiple sclerosis, stroke, and spinal cord injury |journal = Curr Med Res Opin |volume = 24 |issue = 2 |pages = 425–39 |date = Feb 2008 |doi = 10.1185/030079908X261113 |pmid = 18167175 }}</ref> Tizanidine can be very strong even at the 2&nbsp;mg dose and may cause [[hypotension]], so caution is advised when it is used in patients who have a history of orthostatic hypotension, or when switching from gel cap to tablet form and vice versa.

Tizanidine can occasionally cause [[acute liver failure]]. Clinical trials show that up to 5% of patients treated with tizanidine had elevated liver function test values, though symptoms disappeared upon withdrawal of the drug. Care should be used when first beginning treatment with tizanidine with regular liver tests for the first six months of treatment. As of 2015 the cost for a typical month of medication in the United States is US$100{{ndash}}200.<ref name=Ric2015>{{cite book |last1 = Hamilton |first1 = Richart |title = Tarascon Pocket Pharmacopoeia 2015 Deluxe Lab-Coat Edition |date = 2015 |publisher = Jones & Bartlett Learning |isbn = 978-1-284-05756-0 |page = 3 }}</ref>

== Interactions ==

[[Concomitant drug|Concomitant]] use of tizanidine and moderate or potent [[CYP1A2]] inhibitors (such as [[zileuton]], certain antiarrhythmics ([[amiodarone]], [[mexiletine]], [[propafenone]], [[verapamil]]), [[cimetidine]], [[famotidine]], [[aciclovir]], [[ticlopidine]] and [[Oral contraceptive pill|oral contraceptives]]) is contraindicated. Concomitant use of tizanidine with [[fluvoxamine]], a potent CYP1A2 inhibitor in humans, resulted in a 33-fold increase in the tizanidine [[Area under curve|AUC]] (plasma drug concentration-time curve).<ref name="Zanaflex PI">{{cite web |title = Zanaflex (tizanidine hydrochloride) Capsules and Tablets for Oral Use.

Alcohol should be avoided, particularly as it can upset the stomach. The CNS-depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive.<ref name="Zanaflex PI" />

It has a [[volume of distribution]] of 2.4 L/kg following intravenous administration.<ref name="Zanaflex PI" />

== Side effects ==

Side effects include dizziness, drowsiness, weakness, nervousness, hallucinations, depression, vomiting, dry mouth, constipation, diarrhea, stomach pain, heartburn, increased muscle spasms, back pain, rash, sweating, and a tingling sensation in the arms, legs, hands, and feet.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0000106/ |title = Page not available |first =  |last = pmhdev |date =  |website = PubMed Health |accessdate = 4 September 2017 }}</ref>
