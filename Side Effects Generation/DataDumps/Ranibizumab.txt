'''Ranibizumab''' (trade name '''Lucentis''' among others) is a [[monoclonal antibody]] fragment ([[Fragment antigen-binding|Fab]]) created from the same parent mouse antibody as [[bevacizumab]]. It is an [[anti-angiogenics|anti-angiogenic]] that has been approved to treat the "wet" type of age-related [[macular degeneration]] (AMD, also ARMD), a common form of age-related [[vision loss]].

Its effectiveness is similar to that of [[bevacizumab]].<ref name=For2014>{{cite journal|last1=Formoso|first1=G|last2=Marata|first2=AM|last3=Magrini|first3=N|last4=Bero|first4=L|title=A clearer view of evidence in treating macular degeneration: off-label policies and independent research.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=Sep 15, 2014|volume=9|pages=ED000090|pmid=25228121|doi=10.1002/14651858.ED000090}}</ref><ref name="Schmucker C, Ehlken C, Agostini HT, et al. 2012 e42701">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Schmucker C, Ehlken C, Agostini HT, etal |title=A safety review and meta-analyses of bevacizumab and ranibizumab: off-label versus goldstandard |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=8 |pages=e42701 |year=2012 |pmid=22880086 |pmc=3411814 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0042701 |url=}}</ref> Its rates of side effects also appear similar.<ref name=Moja2014/> However, ranibizumab typically costs $2,000 a dose, while the equivalent dose of bevacizumab typically costs $50.<ref name=WP>{{cite news

Ranibizumab was developed by [[Genentech]] and is marketed in the United States by Genentech and elsewhere by [[Novartis]],<ref>[http://www.gene.com/gene/products/information/tgr/lucentis/factsheet.html Lucentis Fact Sheet]. Genentech.</ref> under the brand name Lucentis.

==Pharmacology==
Ranibizumab is a [[monoclonal antibody]] that inhibits [[angiogenesis]] by inhibiting [[Vascular endothelial growth factor A]], a mechanism similar to [[Bevacizumab]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://reference.medscape.com/drug/lucentis-ranibizumab-343645#10 |title=ranibizumab |website=medscape |accessdate=24 March 2015}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
It is often used for [[age-related wet macular degeneration]]. Its effectiveness is similar to that of [[bevacizumab]]<ref name="For2014"/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Solomon|first1=SD|last2=Lindsley|first2=K|last3=Vedula|first3=SS|last4=Krzystolik|first4=MG|last5=Hawkins|first5=BS|title=Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor for neovascular age-related macular degeneration.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=Aug 29, 2014|volume=8|pages=CD005139|pmid=25170575|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005139.pub3|pmc=4270425}}</ref> and [[aflibercept]].<ref name="Sarwar">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sarwar S, Clearfield E, Soliman MK, Sadiq MA, Baldwin AJ, Hanout M, Agarwal A, Sepah YJ, Do DV, Nguyen QD |title= Aflibercept for neovascular age-related macular degeneration |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume=2 |pages= CD011346 |date=2016 |pmid= 26857947 |doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD011346.pub2}}</ref> A 2017 systematic review update found that while ranibizumab and bevacizumab provide similar functional outcomes in [[diabetic retinopathy|diabetic macular edema]], there is low-certainty evidence suggesting that ranibizumab is more effective in reducing central retinal thickness than bevacizumab.<ref name="Virgili">{{cite journal |authors=Virgili G, Parravano M, Evans JR, Gordon I, Lucenteforte E |title= Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor for diabetic macular oedema: a network meta-analysis |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume=6 |pages= CD007419 |date=2017 |pmid= 28639415 |doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD007419.pub5}}</ref>

== Side effects ==
A 2014 Cochrane review did not find a difference between bevacizumab and ranibizumab in deaths or total severe side effects when used for macular degeneration.<ref name=Moja2014>{{cite journal|last1=Moja|first1=L|last2=Lucenteforte|first2=E|last3=Kwag|first3=KH|last4=Bertele|first4=V|last5=Campomori|first5=A|last6=Chakravarthy|first6=U|last7=D'Amico|first7=R|last8=Dickersin|first8=K|last9=Kodjikian|first9=L|last10=Lindsley|first10=K|last11=Loke|first11=Y|last12=Maguire|first12=M|last13=Martin|first13=DF|last14=Mugelli|first14=A|last15=Mühlbauer|first15=B|last16=Püntmann|first16=I|last17=Reeves|first17=B|last18=Rogers|first18=C|last19=Schmucker|first19=C|last20=Subramanian|first20=ML|last21=Virgili|first21=G|title=Systemic safety of bevacizumab versus ranibizumab for neovascular age-related macular degeneration.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=Sep 15, 2014|volume=9|pages=CD011230|pmid=25220133|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011230.pub2|pmc=4262120}}</ref> There; however, was not a lot of evidence and thus this conclusion is not that certain.<ref name=Moja2014/>

Ranibizumab does appear to result in a lower risk of stomach and intestinal problems.<ref name=Moja2014/> It is also associated with a low rate of eye related side effects.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schmucker|first1=C|last2=Ehlken|first2=C|last3=Agostini|first3=HT|last4=Antes|first4=G|last5=Ruecker|first5=G|last6=Lelgemann|first6=M|last7=Loke|first7=YK|title=A safety review and meta-analyses of bevacizumab and ranibizumab: off-label versus goldstandard.|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2012|volume=7|issue=8|pages=e42701|pmid=22880086|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0042701|pmc=3411814}}</ref>

The most common side effects in clinical trials were conjunctival haemorrhage, eye pain, vitreous [[floater]]s, increased [[intraocular pressure]], and intraocular inflammation.

Although there is a theoretical risk for arterial thromboembolic events in people receiving VEGF-inhibitors by intravitreal injection, the observed incidence rate was low (< 4%) and similar to that seen with placebo.

Serious adverse events related to the injection procedure occurred with an incidence rate of less than 1% and included [[endophthalmitis]], [[retinal detachment]], and traumatic [[cataract]]s. Other serious ocular adverse events observed among ranibizumab-treated patients (incidence rate < 1%) included intraocular inflammation and blindness.<ref name="AustriaCodex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2009|edition=2009/2010|isbn=3-85200-196-X|language=German}}{{Page needed|date=July 2011}}</ref>

No significant interactions are known.<ref name="Lexicomp">[http://0-online.lexi.com.wildpac.wne.edu/lco/action/doc/retrieve/docid/patch_f/518390 Ranibizumab], Lexi-Drugs. ''Ranibizumab.'' Lexi-Comp, Inc.; 2007.</ref>

== Administration ==
The drug is injected intravitreally (into the [[vitreous humour]] of the eye) once a month. If monthly injections are not feasible, the regimen may be reduced to 1 injection every 3 months after the first 4 months.<ref name="lucentis-prescribing" />

Dosing every 3 months is linked to a loss of approximately 5 letters (1 line) in visual acuity for the following 9 months as compared with dosing on a monthly basis. Large phase 3 clinical trials (MARINA and ANCHOR) which randomized patients with wet macular degeneration showed that 95% of ranibizumab-treated patients maintained visual acuity compared with 62% of those administered placebo (P < .01) at 1 year; moreover, up to 40% demonstrated an improvement in vision of at least 3 lines. Vision maintenance and loss were defined as a loss of less than 15 letters and a gain of 15 or more letters in visual acuity, respectively, as measured using the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy eye chart.<ref>{{Cite journal

Similar results were found in a randomized controlled trial of patients suffering from [[macular edema]] caused by [[central retinal vein occlusion]].

==Marketing issues==
On November 3, 2010, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Genentech began offering secret rebates to about 300 ophthalmologists in an apparent inducement to get them to use more ranibizumab rather than their less expensive bevacizumab.  This may have been in anticipation of the results of the CATT clinical trial,<ref name="CATT" /> which was sponsored by the National Eye Institute, and compared the relative safety and efficacy of ranibizumab and bevacizumab in treating AMD. In 2008, bevacizumab cost Medicare only $20 million for about 480,000 injections, while ranibizumab cost Medicare $537 million for only 337,000 injections.<ref>{{cite news

</ref>  The trial showed that the two drugs "had equivalent effects on visual acuity when administered according to the same schedule;" however, serious adverse events were more common in the bevacizumab arm of the trial.

The results of several subsequent head-to-head trials of the two anti-VEGF treatments were later published, and the overall results reinforced CATT's findings. The two therapies performed equally at restoring visual acuity according to a 2012 meta-analysis,<ref name=Jiang2014>{{cite journal|author1=Jiang S|author2=Park C|author3=Barner JC|title=Ranibizumab for age-related macular degeneration: a meta-analysis of dose effects and comparison with no anti-VEGF treatment and bevacizumab|journal=J Clin Pharm Ther|date=Jun 2014|volume=39|issue=3|pages=234–9|doi=10.1111/jcpt.12146|pmid=24635444|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpt.12146/full|accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref> and also in the IVAN trial, alone and in the investigators' meta-analysis pooling its own results with CATT's.<ref name=IVAN2013>{{cite journal|author1=Chakravarthy U|author2=Harding SP|author3=Rogers CA|author4=Downes SM|author5=Lotery AJ|author6=Culliford LA|author7=Reeves BC|author8=IVAN study investigators|title=Alternative treatments to inhibit VEGF in age-related choroidal neovascularisation: 2-year findings of the IVAN randomised controlled trial|journal=Lancet|date=Oct 12, 2013|volume=382|issue=9900|pages=1258–67|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61501-9|pmid=23870813}}</ref>  A 2012 meta-analysis focused specifically on safety issues concluded that the rates of several adverse events were higher with bevacizumab, although the absolute rates of ocular serious adverse events were low with both therapies: ocular adverse events were about 2.8 times as frequent with bevacizumab than with ranibizumab, and "The proportion of patients with serious infections and gastrointestinal disorders was also higher."  The authors concluded that " clinicians and patients should continue to carefully weigh-up the benefits and harms when choosing between the two treatment options.
