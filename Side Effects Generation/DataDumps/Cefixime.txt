==Medical uses==

Cefixime treats infections of the:<br>
Ear: [[Otitis]] caused by ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'', ''[[Moraxella catarrhalis]]'' and ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]''.<br>
Sinuses: [[Sinusitis]].<br>
Throat: Tonsillitis, pharyngitis caused by ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]''.<br>
Chest and lungs: Bronchitis, pneumonia caused by ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]] ''and ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]''.<br>
It is also used to treat [[typhoid fever]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Mechanism of Therapeutic Effectiveness of Cefixime against Typhoid Fever|url=http://aac.asm.org/content/45/9/2450.full#ref-3|work=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy|accessdate=7 April 2016|date=September 2001|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202010015/http://aac.asm.org/content/45/9/2450.full#ref-3|archivedate=2 December 2015|df=}}</ref>

===Spectrum of bacterial susceptibility===
Cefixime is a broad spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic and is commonly used to treat bacterial infections of the ear, urinary tract, and upper respiratory tract. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant microorganisms:<ref>http://www.toku-e.com/Assets/MIC/Cefixime%20trihydrate.pdf</ref>
* ''Escherichia coli'': 0.015&nbsp;µg/mL – 4&nbsp;µg/mL
* ''Haemophilus influenzae'': ≤0.004&nbsp;µg/mL – >4&nbsp;µg/mL
* ''Proteus mirabilis'': ≤0.008&nbsp;µg/mL – 0.06&nbsp;µg/mL

==Mechanism of action==

The bactericidal action of Cefixime is due to the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. It binds to one of the [[penicillin binding proteins]] (PBPs) which inhibits the final transpeptidation step of the peptidoglycan synthesis in the bacterial cell wall, thus inhibiting biosynthesis and arresting cell wall assembly resulting in bacterial cell death.

''Absorption''<br>
Only 40–50% is absorbed from the GI tract (oral bioavailability). Absorption may be decreased when taken with food. Average peak concentration after administration of oral suspension is approximately 25–50% greater than the peak concentration following oral tablet or capsules administration.<ref>{{cite web|title=SUPRAX Package Insert|url=http://www.supraxrx.com/pdf/Suprax-Final%20PI%20-PDF%20File.pdf|work=Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|accessdate=7 April 2016|date=March 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223221244/http://supraxrx.com/pdf/Suprax-Final%20PI%20-PDF%20File.pdf|archivedate=23 February 2015|df=}}</ref>

''Distribution''<br>
It has high concentrations in [[bile]] and [[urine]]. It can cross the placenta and its protein binding capacity is 65%.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

It is always better to perform appropriate cultures and susceptibility studies to determine the causative organism and its sensitivity to cefixime.

==Contraindications==

Cefixime is contraindicated in patients with known sensitivity or allergies to [[cephalosporin]] class of [[antibiotics]]. As Cefixime is a third generation cephalosporin, it is not contraindicated for patients with a true penicillin allergy.<ref>http://www.cks.nhs.uk/gonorrhoea/prescribing_information/prescribing_information/cephalosporins_ceftriaxone_or_cefixime{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==Adverse effects==

Adverse drug reactions include [[diarrhea]], [[dyspepsia]], [[nausea]] and vomiting. Hypersensitivity reactions like skin rashes, [[urticaria]] and [[Stevens-Johnson syndrome]] have been reported. Though thrombocytopenia has been reported for many cephalosporins, it has not been reported for cefixime.  
There is no specific [[antidote]] for Cefixime overdosage. Gastric lavage may be performed. Dialysis will not remove Cefixime in significant quantities.

==Drug interactions==
* Alcohol – No major interaction has been observed between cefixime and alcohol.{{better source|date=July 2015}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gonorrhoea/pages/MedicineOverview.aspx?condition=Bacterial%20infections&medicine=Cefixime&preparationCefixime%20100mg/5ml%20oral%20suspension|title=Medicines information links|publisher=NHS Choices|first=N.

==History==

It was sold under the trade name Suprax 125 in the USA until 2003 when it was taken off the market by drug manufacturer [[Wyeth]] after its [[patent]] expired.

==Trade names==
Cefixime is marketed under many [[trade name]]s worldwide.<ref name=genericnames/>
