'''Efungumab''' (trade name '''Mycograb''') is a [[pharmaceutical drug|drug]] developed by NeuTec Pharma (a subsidiary of [[Novartis]]), intended to treat [[fungemia|invasive]] [[candidiasis|''Candida'' infection]] in combination with [[amphotericin B]]. The [[European Medicines Agency]] has twice refused to grant marketing authorization for Mycograb, citing product safety and quality issues.<ref>[[European Medicines Agency]] (2007). {{cite web|url= http://www.emea.europa.eu/humandocs/PDFs/EPAR/mycograb/H-658-RAR-en.pdf |title=REFUSAL CHMP ASSESSMENT REPORT FOR MYCOGRAB.

Detailed assessment report with comprehensive overview of reasons for refusal of marketing authorization.</ref>

Chemically, efungumab is a [[single-chain variable fragment]] of a [[human]] [[monoclonal antibody]].<ref name=WHOList95>{{cite journal | author = [[World Health Organization]] | title = International Nonproprietary Names for Pharmaceutical Substances (INN).

As such, it potentially act similarly to an [[IgA]] - inhibiting by binding and blocking.

Its ability to potentiate the effects of the antifungal amphotericin B in culture were later found to be non-specific.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 3393390 | pmid=22508314 | doi=10.1128/AAC.00435-12 | volume=56 | issue=7 | title=Nonspecific effect of Mycograb on amphotericin B MIC | year=2012 | journal=Antimicrob.
