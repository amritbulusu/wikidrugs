==Medical uses==
Cefazolin is used in a variety of infections provided that susceptible organisms are involved. It is indicated for use in the following infections:<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title = DailyMed - CEFAZOLIN - cefazolin sodium injection, powder, for solution|url = http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=79afc719-8279-49f9-83b0-e0736c07eb5c|website = dailymed.nlm.nih.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-05|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160306013731/http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=79afc719-8279-49f9-83b0-e0736c07eb5c|archivedate = 2016-03-06|df = }}</ref>
* [[Respiratory tract infection]]s
* [[Urinary tract infection]]s
* Skin infections
* Biliary tract infections
* Bone and joint infections
* Genital infections
* Blood infections ([[sepsis]])
* [[Endocarditis]]
It can also be used peri-operatively to prevent infections post-surgery, and is often the preferred drug for surgical prophylaxis.<ref name=":2" />

There is no penetration into the [[central nervous system]] and therefore cefazolin is not effective in treating meningitis.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title = Basic & Clinical Pharmacology|last = Katzung, et. al.|first = Bertram|publisher = McGraw Hill Education|year = 2015|isbn = 978-0-07-182505-4|location = New York|pages = 776–778}}</ref>

Cefazolin has been shown to be effective in treating methicillin-susceptible ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (MSSA) but does not work in cases of [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA).<ref name=":2" /> In many instances of staphylococcal infections, such as bacteremia, cefazolin is an alternative to penicillin in patients who are allergic to penicillin.<ref name=":0" /> However, there is still potential for a reaction to occur with cefazolin and other cephalosporins in patients allergic to penicillin.<ref name=":2" /> Resistance to cefazolin is seen in several species of bacteria, such as [[Mycoplasma]] and [[Chlamydia (genus)|Chlamydia]], in which case different generations of cephalosporins may be more effective.<ref>{{cite web|title = Cefazolin (Injection Route)|publisher = Mayo Clinic|date = 1 July 2015|url = http://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/cefazolin-injection-route/before-using/drg-20073267|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140419012252/http://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/cefazolin-injection-route/before-using/drg-20073267|archivedate = 19 April 2014|df = }}</ref> Cefazolin does not fight against [[Enterococcus]], anaerobic bacteria or atypical bacteria among others.<ref name=":0" />

=== Bacterial susceptibility ===
As a [[First generation cephalosporin|first-generation cephalosporin]] antibiotic, cefazolin and other first-generation antibiotics are very active against [[gram-positive bacteria]] and some [[gram-negative bacteria]].<ref name=":2" /> Their broad spectrum of activity can be attributed to their improved stability to many bacterial [[beta-lactamases]] compared to penicillins.<ref name=":0" />

=== Spectrum of activity ===

Gram-positive aerobes:<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":0" />
* ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' (including beta-lactamase producing strains)
* ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]''
* ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'', ''[[Streptococcus agalactiae]]'', ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' and  other strains of streptococci

Gram-Negative Aerobes:
* ''[[Escherichia coli]]''
* ''[[Proteus mirabilis]]''

=== Non susceptible===
The following are not susceptible:<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":0" /> 
* [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin-resistant ''staphylococcus aureus'']]
* ''[[Enterococcus]]''
* most strains of indole positive Proteus (''[[Proteus vulgaris]]'')
* ''[[Enterobacter|Enterobacter spp]]''[[Enterobacter|.]]
* ''[[Morganella morganii]]''
* ''[[Providencia rettgeri]]''
* ''[[Serratia]] spp''.
* ''[[Pseudomonas]] spp''.
* ''[[Listeria]]''

==Special populations==

=== Pregnancy ===
Cefazolin is [[pregnancy category]] B, indicating general safety for use in pregnancy. Caution should be used in breastfeeding as a small amount of cefazolin enters the breast milk.<ref name=":2" /> Cefazolin can be used prophylactically against perinatal [[Group B streptococcal infection]] (GBS). Although [[penicillin]] and [[ampicillin]] are the standard of care for GBS prophylaxis, penicillin-allergic women with no history of [[anaphylaxis]] can be given cefazolin instead. These patients should be closely monitored as there is a small chance of an allergic reaction due to the similar structure of the antibiotics.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Prevention of Perinatal Group B Streptococcal Disease|url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5910a1.htm|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-05|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151115063145/http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5910a1.htm|archivedate = 2015-11-15|df = }}</ref>

=== Newborns ===
There has been no established safety and effectiveness for use in premature infants and neonates.<ref name=":2" />

=== Elderly ===

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed in clinical trials comparing elderly and younger subjects, however the trials could not eliminate the possibility that some older individuals may have a higher level of sensitivity.<ref name=":2" />

===Additional considerations===
People with kidney disease and those on [[hemodialysis]] may need the dose adjusted.<ref name=":2" /> Cefazolin levels are not significantly affected by liver disease.

As with other antibiotics, cefazolin may [[drug interaction|interact]] with other medications being taken. Some important drugs that may interact with cefazolin such as [[probenecid]].<ref name=":0" />

==Side effects==
[[Adverse drug reaction|Side effect]]s associated with use of cefazolin therapy include:<ref name=":2" />
* Common (1-10%): diarrhea, stomach pain or upset stomach, vomiting, and rash. 
* Uncommon (<1%): dizziness, headache, fatigue, itching, transient hepatitis.<ref>{{Cite web|url =http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2004/50461slr139_ancef_lbl.pdf|title =Cefazolin Prescribing Information|date =2004|accessdate =|website =|publisher =FDA|last =|first =|deadurl =no|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070705/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2004/50461slr139_ancef_lbl.pdf|archivedate =2016-03-04|df =}}</ref>
Patients with penicillin allergies could experience a potential reaction to cefazolin and other cephalosporins.<ref name=":2" /> As with other antibiotics, patients experiencing watery and/or bloody stools occurring up to three months following therapy should contact their prescriber.<ref name=":2" />

Like those of several other cephalosporins, the chemical structure of cefazolin contains an [[N-methylthiodiazole]] (NMTD or 1-MTD) side-chain. As the antibiotic is broken down in the body, it releases free NMTD, which can cause [[hypoprothrombinemia]] (likely due to inhibition of the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase) and a reaction with ethanol similar to that produced by disulfiram (Antabuse), due to inhibition of [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals|last = Stork|first = CM|publisher =McGraw-Hill|year = 2006|location = New York|pages = 847}}</ref> Those with an allergy to [[side effects of penicillin | penicillin]] may develop a cross sensitivity to cefazolin.<ref>{{cite web |publisher =Vancouver Acute Pharmaceutical Sciences, Vancouver Hospital & Health Sciences Centre |date =2016 |access-date =May 19, 2017 |url =http://www.vhpharmsci.com/vhformulary/Tools/ANTIBIOTIC%20CROSS-SENSITIVITY%20CHART.pdf |title =Pharmaceutical Sciences CSU Parenteral Antibiotic Allergy cross-sensitivity chart |deadurl =no |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160417213010/http://www.vhpharmsci.com/VHFormulary/Tools/ANTIBIOTIC%20CROSS-SENSITIVITY%20CHART.pdf |archivedate =April 17, 2016 |df = }}</ref><ref name="Gonz2015">{{cite journal|last1=Gonzalez-Estrada|first1=A.|last2=Radojicic|first2=C.|title=Penicillin allergy: A practical guide for clinicians|journal=Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine|volume=82|issue=5|year=2015|pages=295–300|issn=0891-1150|doi=10.3949/ccjm.82a.14111}}</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==
Cefazolin inhibits cell wall biosynthesis by binding [[Penicillin binding proteins]] which stops peptidoglycan synthesis. Penicillin binding proteins are bacterial proteins that help to catalyze the last stages of peptidoglycan synthesis, which is needed to maintain the cell wall. They remove the D-[[alanine]] from the precursor of the peptidoglycan. The lack of synthesis causes the bacteria to lyse because they also continually break down their cell walls. Cefazolin is bactericidal, meaning it kills the bacteria rather than inhibiting their growth.<ref name=":0" />

==Brand names==
It was initially marketed by [[GlaxoSmithKline]] under the trade name Ancef.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|title = Cefazolin Sodium Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information|url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682731.html|website = www.nlm.nih.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-05|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151006090658/https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682731.html|archivedate = 2015-10-06|df = }}</ref>
