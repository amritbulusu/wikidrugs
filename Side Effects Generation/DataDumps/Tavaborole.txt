'''Tavaborole''' ('''AN2690''', trade name '''Kerydin''') is a [[Topical medication|topical]] [[antifungal medication]] for the treatment of [[onychomycosis]], a [[Fungal infection in animals|fungal infection]] of the nail and [[Nail (anatomy)#Structure|nail bed]]. Tavaborole began its Phase 3 trials in December 2010<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT01270971}}</ref> and was approved by the US FDA in July 2014.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.marketwatch.com/story/fda-approves-anacor-pharmaceuticals-kerydin-tavaborole-topical-solution-5-for-the-treatment-of-onychomycosis-of-the-toenails-2014-07-08 | publisher = Market Watch | date = July 8, 2014 | title = FDA Approves Anacor Pharmaceuticals’ KERYDIN™ (Tavaborole) Topical Solution, 5% for the Treatment of Onychomycosis of the Toenails}}</ref>   Tavaborole inhibits an essential fungal enzyme, [[leucyl-tRNA synthetase]], that is required for [[protein synthesis]]. The inhibition of protein synthesis leads to termination of [[cell growth]] and then [[cell death]], eliminating the fungal infection.

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Tavaborole, when prepared with a 1:1 mixture of ethyl acetate and propylene glycol, has the ability to fully penetrate through the human nail. In studies with cadaver fingernails, a 5% solution of tavaborole penetrated the nail an average of 524.7&nbsp;mcg/cm<sup>2</sup> after two weeks of daily use.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962215015121|title = Efficacy and safety of tavaborole topical solution, 5%, a novel boron-based antifungal agent, for the treatment of toenail onychomycosis: Results from 2 randomized phase-III studies|last = Boni E.

== Clinical ==
Tavaborole is detectable in the blood at a level of 3.54&nbsp;ng/mL after a single use of 0.2 mL of the 5% solution.  Tavaborole has a half-life in the blood of 28.5 hrs, a maximum concentration of 5.17&nbsp;ng/mL after two weeks of daily use, and takes 8.03 days to reach the maximum concentration.<ref name=":0" />

== Therapeutic trials ==
In clinical trials, tavaborole was more effective than the vehicle (ethyl acetate and propylene glycol) alone in curing onychomycosis. In two studies, fungal infection was eliminated using tavaborole in 6.5% of the cases vs. 0.5% using the vehicle alone, and 27.5% vs. 14.6% using the vehicle alone.<ref name=":0" />

== Adverse effects ==
Application site exfoliation, erythema (rash), and irritation are all possible side effects, though they occur in less than 5% of the patents tested.<ref name=":0" />

== Commercial ==
Originally developed by [[Anacor]], it is now marketed in the [[United States]] by [[Novartis]] subsidiary [[Sandoz]]. Anacor was paid US$65 million and also entered into a [[profit sharing]] scheme for future sales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zacks.com/stock/news/140935/anacors-kerydin-to-be-commercialized-by-sandoz-in-the-us|title=Anacor's Kerydin to Be Commercialized by Sandoz in the U.S.|date=22 July 2014|publisher=Zacks.com|accessdate=7 October 2015}}</ref> A 10mL bottle of a 5% solution of Tavaborole will cost the patient without insurance about $1,356.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.empr.com/kerydin/drug/34292/|title = KERYDIN|date = |accessdate = 12 August 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>
