'''[[Collagenase]] ''clostridium histolyticum''''' is an [[enzyme]] produced by the bacterium ''[[Clostridium histolyticum]] ''that dismantles [[collagen]]. It is used as a powder-and-solvent injection kit for the treatment of [[Dupuytren's contracture]], a condition where the fingers bend towards the palm and cannot be fully straightened, and [[Peyronie's disease]], a connective tissue disorder involving the growth of fibrous plaques in the soft tissue of the penis. BioSpecifics Technologies developed the preparation, which is manufactured and marketed by Auxilium Pharmaceuticals as '''Xiaflex''' in the US and by Sobi as '''Xiapex''' in Europe.

==Uses==
In February 2010, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] of the United States approved Xiaflex for the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture.<ref>{{cite web|title=FDA Approves Xiaflex for Debilitating Hand Condition|date=February 2, 2010|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm199736.htm|publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]]|accessdate=March 16, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Triumph for Drug to Straighten Clenched Fingers|first=Andrew|last=Pollack|date=March 15, 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/16/business/16hand.html|accessdate=March 16, 2010}}</ref> It is the first approved nonsurgical treatment for this condition.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bringing Movement Back to Clenched Hands|first=Andrew|last=Pollack|date=March 15, 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/16/business/16handbar.html|accessdate=March 16, 2010}}</ref> In a case of Dupuytren's contracture, [[collagen]] accumulates in the [[palmar fascia]] of the hands, so that the fingers cannot be straightened. A similar phenomenon occurs in [[Peyronie's disease]], a contracture of the penis.

In February 2011, the European Commission's [[Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use]] approved the product for the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture in adults with a palpable cord by 'properly trained' doctors.<ref>[http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/002048/human_med_001423.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d125&murl=menus/medicines/medicines.jsp&jsenabled=false# ''Xiapex: collagenase clostridium histolyticum'', European Medicines Agency, Undated].Accessed: 20 March 2011.</ref> Pfizer was reported to be working with Europe's national medicines regulatory bodies to launch the new treatment, hoping doctors could prescribe the treatment by late 2011.<ref>[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/217991.php ''Xiapex (Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum) Authorised In The European Union For Dupuytren's Contracture'', Medical News Today, Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex, 3 March 2011].Accessed: 19 March 2011.</ref>

On November 7, 2012, BioSpecifics announced {{cite web|title=BioSpecifics Technologies Corp. : Reports Third Quarter 2012 Financial Results|url=http://www.4-traders.com/BIOSPECIFICS-TECHNOLOGIES-866015/news/BioSpecifics-Technologies-Corp-Reports-Third-Quarter-2012-Financial-Results-15482339/}} Auxilium's submission of a License Application to the FDA for Xiaflex for the potential treatment of Peyronie's disease, an excess of inelastic collagen causing penile curvature deformity. The FDA approved Xiaflex for the treatment of Peyronie’s disease in December 2013. Following this, Xiapex gained EU approval for the treatment of Peyronie’s disease in February 2015, making it the first and only biologic therapy indicated for the treatment of Peyronie's disease.<ref>[http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/28953/ Xiapex summary of product characteristics]</ref> Auxilium has also reported additional trials for potential use of Xiaflex are underway for the treatment of frozen shoulder, cellulite reductions and both human and canine lipomas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Xiaflex for the Treatment of Cellulite|url=http://www.xiaflex.org}}</ref>

==Side effects==
The most common side effects include [[lymphadenopathy]] (swollen [[lymph node]]s), itching, pain, [[oedema]], and bleeding (for example in the form of [[bruise]]s or [[ecchymoses]]). [[Allergic reaction]]s are seen in less than 1% of patients.<ref name="AustriaCodex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2009|edition=2009/2010|isbn=3-85200-196-X|language=German}}</ref>

==Chemical properties==
The substance is a constant mixture of two collagenases (AUX-I and AUX-II) with known [[amino acid sequence]]s and a length of about 1000 amino acids each. It is prepared by [[anaerobic fermentation]] from a [[strain (biology)|strain]] of ''C. histolyticum'' that has been known since 1950.<ref name="Klement">{{cite journal| author = A. Klement| date = 9 May 2011| title = Dupuytren'sche Kontraktur erstmals medikamentös behandelbar: Xiapex| journal = Österreichische Apothekerzeitung| issue = 10/2011| pages = 8| language = German}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==
The enzymes do not reach the bloodstream in significant amounts and are presumed to largely stay at the point of injection<ref name="AustriaCodex" /> until they are broken down by [[protease]]s.

The two collagenases act [[synergistic]]ally by cleaving [[tropocollagen]] (the 'collagen molecule') at different points. AUX-I attacks the [[C-terminus|C]]- and [[N-termini]], AUX-II cleaves amino acid bonds within the molecule. Small collagen fragments are broken down by both enzymes.<ref name="Klement" />

==Interactions==
No interaction studies have been conducted because the drug does not reach the bloodstream and the liver. It is theorised that drugs interfering with [[matrix metalloproteinase]]s, such as [[tetracyclines]], [[anthracyclines]], [[quinolones]] and [[anthraquinone]] derivatives, could reduce the efficacy of the collagenases, but no clinical evidence for such an interaction has been observed.<ref name="AustriaCodex" />
