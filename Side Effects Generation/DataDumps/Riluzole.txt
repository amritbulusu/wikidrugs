'''Riluzole''' (marketed as Rilutek and Teglutik) is a [[medication|drug]] used to treat [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]]. Riluzole delays the onset of [[ventilator]]-dependence or [[tracheostomy]] in selected [[patient]]s and may increase survival by approximately two to three months.<ref name="Coch">{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=RG|author2=Mitchell, JD |author3=Moore, DH |title=Riluzole for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/motor neuron disease (MND)|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=14 March 2012|volume=3|issue=3|pages=CD001447|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001447.pub3|pmid=22419278|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001447.pub3/pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

Riluzole is available in a tablet and liquid form. The liquid formulation may be more suitable for patients with swallowing difficulties.

==Medical use==

=== Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ===

There has been some evidence to show that higher doses might produce more significant improvements in ALS patients but at almost £6 (US$10) per tablet it is at risk of being prohibitively expensive given the modest benefit to patients. One study in the Netherlands found that riluzole is metabolized differently by males and females, and its levels in [[Blood plasma|plasma]] are decreased in patients who smoke [[cigarettes]] or take [[omeprazole]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=van Kan|first1=HJ|last2=Groeneveld|first2=GJ|last3=Kalmijn|first3=S|last4=Spieksma|first4=M|last5=van den Berg|first5=LH|last6=Guchelaar|first6=HJ|title=Association between CYP1A2 activity and riluzole clearance in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.|journal=[[British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology]]|date=March 2005|volume=59|issue=3|pages=310–3|pmid=15752377|pmc=1884790 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.2004.02233.x|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1884790/pdf/bcp0059-0310.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> A [[Cochrane Library]] review states a 9% gain in the probability of surviving one year.<ref name = Coch/>

===Research===
A clinical study on mice has shown riluzole to compensate for harmful [[glutamate]] levels and promote dendritic spine clustering in hippocampal circuits implicated in memory and emotion. Therefore, the drug may act as an effective treatment for [[Memory loss|age-related memory loss]] and other forms of [[cognitive decline]].<ref>{{cite journal|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/111/52/18733.abstract |title= Glutamatergic regulation prevents hippocampal-dependent age-related cognitive decline through dendritic spine clustering |accessdate = 18 January 2015|website = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|doi=10.1073/pnas.1421285111|volume=111|issue = 52|pages=18733–18738|year = 2014|last1 = Pereira|first1 = Ana C.|last2 = Lambert|first2 = Hilary K.|last3 = Grossman|first3 = Yael S.|last4 = Dumitriu|first4 = Dani|last5 = Waldman|first5 = Rachel|last6 = Jannetty|first6 = Sophia K.|last7 = Calakos|first7 = Katina|last8 = Janssen|first8 = William G.|last9 = McEwen|first9 = Bruce S.|last10 = Morrison|first10 = John H.|bibcode = 2014PNAS..11118733P}}</ref> The effect of riluzole on glutamate dysfunction in humans with [[Alzheimer's disease]] is unknown; however, a clinical trial is taking place to investigate this.<ref>{{cite web|title=Glutamatergic Dysfunction in Cognitive Aging: Riluzole in Mild Alzheimers Disease|url=http://clinicalstudies.rucares.org/protocol.php?id=387&cat=53|website=rucares.org|accessdate=12 March 2015}}</ref>

===Overdose===
Symptoms of overdose include: neurological and psychiatric symptoms, acute toxic encephalopathy with stupor, coma and [[methemoglobinemia]].<ref name = TGA/> Severe methemoglobinemia may be rapidly reversible after treatment with methylene blue.<ref name = TGA/>

==Contraindications==
Contraindications for riluzole include: known prior hypersensitivity to riluzole or any of the excipients inside the preparations, liver disease, pregnancy or lactation.<ref name = TGA/>

===Interactions===
[[CYP1A2]] substrates, inhibitors and inducers would probably interact with riluzole, due its dependency on this cytochrome for metabolism.<ref name = TGA/>
