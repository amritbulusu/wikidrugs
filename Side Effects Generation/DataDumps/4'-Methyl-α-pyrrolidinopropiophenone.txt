'''4'-Methyl-α-pyrrolidinopropiophenone''' ('''4-MePPP''', '''MPPP''' or '''MαPPP''') is a [[stimulant]] drug and [[substituted cathinone]]. It is structurally very similar to [[Alpha-Pyrrolidinopropiophenone|α-PPP]], with only one added methyl group in the para position on the phenyl ring. 4-MePPP was sold in Germany as a [[designer drug]] in the late 1990s and early 2000s,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Springer | first1 = D | last2 = Peters | first2 = FT | last3 = Fritschi | first3 = G | last4 = Maurer | first4 = HH | title = Studies on the metabolism and toxicological detection of the new designer drug 4'-methyl-alpha-pyrrolidinopropiophenone in urine using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry | journal = Journal of Chromatography B | volume = 773 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–33 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12015267 | doi = 10.1016/S1570-0232(01)00578-5 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Springer | first1 = D | last2 = Paul | first2 = LD | last3 = Staack | first3 = RF | last4 = Kraemer | first4 = T | last5 = Maurer | first5 = HH | title = Identification of cytochrome p450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of 4'-methyl-alpha-pyrrolidinopropiophenone, a novel scheduled designer drug, in human liver microsomes | journal = Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals | volume = 31 | issue = 8 | pages = 979–82 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12867484 | doi = 10.1124/dmd.31.8.979 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Springer | first1 = D | last2 = Fritschi | first2 = G | last3 = Maurer | first3 = HH | title = Metabolism of the new designer drug alpha-pyrrolidinopropiophenone (PPP) and the toxicological detection of PPP and 4'-methyl-alpha-pyrrolidinopropiophenone (MPPP) studied in rat urine using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry | journal = Journal of Chromatography B | volume = 796 | issue = 2 | pages = 253–66 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14581066 | doi = 10.1016/j.jchromb.2003.07.008 }}</ref> along with a number of other [[substituted cathinone|pyrrolidinophenone derivatives]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Maurer | first1 = HH | last2 = Kraemer | first2 = T | last3 = Springer | first3 = D | last4 = Staack | first4 = RF | title = Chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology, and hepatic metabolism of designer drugs of the amphetamine (ecstasy), piperazine, and pyrrolidinophenone types: a synopsis | journal = Therapeutic drug monitoring | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 127–31 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15228152 | doi = 10.1097/00007691-200404000-00007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Staack | first1 = RF | last2 = Maurer | first2 = HH | title = Metabolism of designer drugs of abuse | journal = Current drug metabolism | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 259–74 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15975043 | doi = 10.2174/1389200054021825 }}</ref> Although it has never achieved the same international popularity as its better-known relations α-PPP and [[MDPV]], 4-MePPP is still sometimes found as an ingredient of grey-market "[[Bath salts (drug)|bath salt]]" blends<ref name="pmid21960541">{{cite journal |vauthors=Brandt SD, Freeman S, Sumnall HR, Measham F, Cole J |title=Analysis of NRG 'legal highs' in the UK: identification and formation of novel cathinones |journal=Drug Testing and Analysis |volume= 3|issue= 9|pages= 569–75|date=December 2010 |pmid=21960541 |doi=10.1002/dta.204 |url=}}</ref> such as "NRG-3".<ref name="pmid21960541" />
