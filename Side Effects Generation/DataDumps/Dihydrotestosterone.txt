'''Dihydrotestosterone''' ('''DHT'''), or '''5α-dihydrotestosterone''' ('''5α-DHT'''), also known as '''androstanolone''' or '''stanolone''', is an [[endogenous]] [[androgen]] [[sex steroid]] and [[steroid hormone|hormone]]. The [[enzyme]] [[5α-reductase]] catalyzes the [[biosynthesis|formation]] of DHT from [[testosterone]] in certain [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s including the [[prostate gland]], [[seminal vesicles]], [[epididymis|epididymides]], [[skin]], [[hair follicle]]s, [[liver]], and [[brain]]. This enzyme mediates reduction of the C4-5 [[double bond]] of testosterone. Relative to testosterone, DHT is considerably more potent as an [[agonist]] of the [[androgen receptor]] (AR).

==Biological function==
DHT is biologically important for [[sexual differentiation]] of the [[male genitalia]] during [[embryogenesis]], maturation of the penis and scrotum at [[puberty]], [[hair growth|growth]] of [[facial hair|facial]], [[body hair|body]], and [[pubic hair]], [[sebum]] production, and development and maintenance of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles.<ref name="pmid16985920" /> It is produced from the less potent testosterone by the [[enzyme]] [[5α-reductase]] in select tissues, and is the primary androgen in the genitals, prostate gland, seminal vesicles, skin, and hair follicles.<ref name="pmid16985920" />

DHT signals mainly in an [[intracrine]] and [[paracrine]] manner in the tissues in which it is produced, playing only a minor role, if any, as a circulating [[endocrine]] hormone.<ref name="pmid1551803">{{cite journal | vauthors = Horton R | title = Dihydrotestosterone is a peripheral paracrine hormone | journal = J.

In addition to normal biological functions, DHT also plays an important causative role in a number of [[androgen-dependent condition]]s including skin and hair conditions like [[acne]], [[seborrhea]], [[hirsutism]], and [[pattern hair loss]] (androgenic alopecia or pattern baldness) and [[prostate disease]]s such as [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] (BPH) and [[prostate cancer]].<ref name="pmid16985920" /> [[5α-Reductase inhibitor]]s, which prevent DHT synthesis, are effective in the prevention and treatment of these conditions.<ref name="Blume-PeytaviWhiting2008" /><ref name="pmid22333687" /><ref name="pmid22446342" /><ref name="KatsambasLotti2015" />

===5α-Reductase deficiency===
{{See also|5α-Reductase deficiency}}

Much of the biological role of DHT has been elucidated in studies of individuals with [[congenital]] [[5α-reductase deficiency|5α-reductase type II deficiency]], an [[intersex condition]] caused by a [[loss-of-function mutation|loss-of-function]] [[genetic mutation|mutation]] in the [[gene]] encoding [[5α-reductase type II]], the major enzyme responsible for the production of DHT in the body.<ref name="Blume-PeytaviWhiting2008">{{cite book | first1 = Ulrike | last1 = Blume-Peytavi | first2 = David A. | last2 = Whiting | first3 = Ralph M. | last3 = Trüeb | name-list-format = vanc | title=Hair Growth and Disorders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pHrX2-huQCoC&pg=PA161|date=26 June 2008|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-46911-7|pages=161–162}}</ref><ref name="pmid25321150">{{cite journal | vauthors = Okeigwe I, Kuohung W | title = 5-Alpha reductase deficiency: a 40-year retrospective review | journal = Curr Opin Endocrinol Diabetes Obes | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 483–7 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25321150 | doi = 10.1097/MED.0000000000000116 | url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid16985920">{{cite journal | vauthors = Marks LS | title = 5α-reductase: history and clinical importance | journal = Rev Urol | volume = 6 Suppl 9 | issue = | pages = S11–21 | year = 2004 | pmid = 16985920 | pmc = 1472916 | doi = | url = }}</ref> It is characterized by a defective and non-functional 5α-reductase type II enzyme and a partial but majority loss of DHT production in the body.<ref name="Blume-PeytaviWhiting2008" /><ref name="pmid25321150" /> In the condition, circulating testosterone levels are within or slightly above the normal male range, but DHT levels are low (around 30% of normal),<ref name="HeesakkersChapple2016" />{{Better citation needed|date=July 2017}} and the ratio of circulating testosterone to DHT is greatly elevated (at about 3.5 to 5&nbsp;times higher than normal).<ref name="Blume-PeytaviWhiting2008" />

Genetic males (46,XY) with 5α-reductase type II deficiency are born with [[undervirilization]] including [[pseudohermaphroditism]] (ambiguous genitalia), [[pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias]], and usually [[cryptorchidism|undescended testes]].<ref name="Blume-PeytaviWhiting2008" /> Their external genitalia are female-like, with [[micropenis]] (a small, [[clitoris]]-like [[phallus]]), a partially unfused, [[labia]]-like [[scrotum]], and a blind-ending, shallow [[vagina|vaginal pouch]].<ref name="Blume-PeytaviWhiting2008" /> Due to their lack of conspicuous [[male genitalia]], genetic males with the condition are typically raised as girls.<ref name="pmid25321150" /> At the time of [[puberty]] however, they develop striking phenotypically masculine [[secondary sexual characteristic]]s including partial virilization of the genitals (enlargement of the phallus into a near-functional penis and [[testicular descent|descent of the testes]]), [[voice deepening]], typical male [[human musculoskeletal system|musculoskeletal]] development,<ref name="pmid23431485" /> and no [[menstruation]], [[breast development]], or other signs of [[feminization (biology)|feminization]] that occur during female puberty.<ref name="Blume-PeytaviWhiting2008" /><ref name="pmid25321150" /><ref name="pmid16985920" /> In addition, normal [[libido]] and [[spontaneous erection]]s develop,<ref name="pmid12573814" /> they usually show a [[sexual orientation|sexual preference]] for females, and almost all develop a male [[gender identity]].<ref name="Blume-PeytaviWhiting2008" /><ref name="pmid431680">{{cite journal | vauthors = Imperato-McGinley J, Peterson RE, Gautier T, Sturla E | title = Androgens and the evolution of male-gender identity among male pseudohermaphrodites with 5alpha-reductase deficiency | journal = N.

Nonetheless, males with 5α-reductase type II deficiency exhibit signs of continued undervirilization in a number of domains.<ref name="Blume-PeytaviWhiting2008" /> [[Facial hair]] was absent or sparse in a relatively large group of [[People of the Dominican Republic|Dominican]] males with the condition.<ref name="Blume-PeytaviWhiting2008" /> However, more facial hair has been observed in patients with the disorder from other parts of the world, although facial hair was still reduced relative to that of other men in the same communities.<ref name="Blume-PeytaviWhiting2008" /> The divergent findings may reflect racial differences in androgen-dependent hair growth.<ref name="Blume-PeytaviWhiting2008" /> A female pattern of [[androgenic hair]] [[hair growth|growth]], with [[terminal hair]] largely restricted to the [[axilla]]e and lower [[pubic area|pubic triangle]], is observed in males with the condition.<ref name="Blume-PeytaviWhiting2008" /> No temporal recession of the hairline or [[androgenic alopecia]] (pattern hair loss or baldness) has been observed in any of the cases of 5α-reductase type II deficiency that have been reported,<ref name="Blume-PeytaviWhiting2008" /> whereas this is normally seen to some degree in almost all Caucasian males.<ref name="Blume-PeytaviWhiting2008" /> Individuals with 5α-reductase type II deficiency were initially reported to have no incidence of [[acne]],<ref name="Melmed2016" /><ref name="pmid16985920" /> but subsequent research indicated normal [[sebum]] [[secretion]] and acne incidence.<ref name="pmid23431485">{{cite journal | vauthors = Marchetti PM, Barth JH | title = Clinical biochemistry of dihydrotestosterone | journal = Ann.

Unlike other androgens such as testosterone, DHT cannot be converted by the enzyme [[aromatase]] into an [[estrogen]] like [[estradiol]]. Therefore, it is frequently used in research settings to distinguish between the effects of testosterone caused by binding to the AR and those caused by testosterone's conversion to estradiol and subsequent binding to and activation of ERs.<ref name="pmid10332569">{{cite journal | vauthors = Swerdloff RS, Wang C | title = Dihydrotestosterone: a rationale for its use as a non-aromatizable androgen replacement therapeutic agent | journal = Baillière's Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 501–6 | date = October 1998 | pmid = 10332569 | doi = 10.1016/s0950-351x(98)80267-x }}</ref> Although DHT cannot be aromatized, it is still converted transformed into metabolites with significant ER affinity and activity.<ref name="pmid22231829" /> These are 3α-androstanediol and 3β-androstanediol, which are predominant agonists of the ERβ.<ref name="pmid22231829" />

==Chemistry==
DHT, also known as '''5α-androstan-17β-ol-3-one''', is a [[natural product|naturally occurring]] [[androstane]] [[steroid]] with a [[ketone group]] at the C3 position and a [[hydroxyl group]] at the C17β position. It is the [[chemical derivative|derivative]] of testosterone in which the [[double bond]] between the C4 and C5 positions has been [[redox|reduced]] or [[hydrogenation|hydrogenated]].
