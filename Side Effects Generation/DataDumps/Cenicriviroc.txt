Inhibition of CCR2 may have an anti-inflammatory effect.

A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study to assess the antiviral activity, safety, and tolerability of cenicriviroc was conducted in 2010.  HIV-infected patients taking cenicriviroc had significant reductions in viral load, with the effect persisting up to two weeks after discontinuation of treatment.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Reviriego | first1 = C | title = Chemokine CCR2/CCR5 Receptor Antagonist Anti-HIV Agent | journal = Drugs of the Future | date = July 2011 | volume = 36 | issue = 7 | pages = 511–7 | doi = 10.1358/dof.2011.36.7.1622066}}</ref>  Additional Phase II clinical trials are underway.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thebody.com/content/62837/tobira-therapeutics-initiates-phase-2b-trial-of-ce.html | title = Tobira Therapeutics Initiates Phase 2b Trial of Cenicriviroc | publisher = The Body | date = July 5, 2011}}</ref>

Phase IIb data presented at the 20th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) in March 2013 showed similar viral suppression rates of 76% for patients taking 100&nbsp;mg cenicriviroc, 73% with 200&nbsp;mg cenicriviroc, and 71% with [[efavirenz]]. Non-response rates were higher with cenicriviroc, however, largely due to greater drop-out of patients. A new tablet formulation with lower pill burden may improve adherence. Looking at immune and inflammatory biomarkers, levels of [[CCL2|MCP-1]] increased and soluble [[CD14]] decreased in the cenicriviroc arms.<ref>[http://www.hivandhepatitis.com/hiv-aids/hiv-aids-topics/hiv-treatment/4009-croi-2013-dual-ccr5ccr2-inhibitor-cenicriviroc-has-both-anti-hiv-and-anti-inflammatory-effects CROI 2013: CCR5/CCR2 Inhibitor Cenicriviroc Has Both Anti-HIV and Anti-inflammatory Effects].
