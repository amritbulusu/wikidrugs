'''Naratriptan''' (trade names include '''Amerge''' and '''Naramig''') is a [[triptan]] [[medication|drug]] marketed by [[GlaxoSmithKline]] and is used for the treatment of [[migraine]] [[headaches]]. Naratriptan is available in 2.5&nbsp;mg tablets. It is a selective [[5-HT1|5-HT<sub>1</sub>]] receptor subtype [[agonist]].

==Indication==
Naratriptan is used for the treatment of the acute migraine attacks and the symptoms of migraine, including severe, throbbing headaches that sometimes are accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to sound or light.<ref name=medline>Medline Plus Drug Information  for [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a601083.html Naratriptan] Accessed 6 August 2009</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
The causes of migraine are not clearly understood; however, the efficacy of naratriptans and other triptans is believed to be due to their activity as [[Triptans#Mechanism of action|5HT (serotonin) agonists]].

==Efficacy==
A meta-analysis of 53 clinical trials has shown that all triptans are effective for treating migraine at marketed doses and that naratriptan, although less effective than [[sumatriptan]] and [[rizatriptan]] was more effective than placebo in reducing migraine symptoms at two hours<ref name=ferrari>Triptans (serotonin, 5-HT1B/1D agonists) in migraine: detailed results and methods of a meta-analysis of 53 trials. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12383060 Cephalalgia 2002 Oct;22(8):633-58.]</ref> and efficacy was demonstrated in almost two thirds of subjects after four hours of treatment.<ref name=havanka>Efficacy of naratriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine: A dose-ranging study. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0149-2918(00)80068-5 Clin Ther 2000 Aug;22(8):970-80.]</ref>

==Side effects==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2017}}
Side effects include: dizziness, [[lethargy|drowsiness]], [[paresthesia|tingling of the hands or feet]], nausea, [[xerostomia|dry mouth]] and unsteadiness. If these effects persist or worsen, notify your doctor promptly. Side-effects which are unlikely and which should be promptly reported include: chest pain/pressure, throat pain/pressure, unusually fast/slow/irregular pulse, one-sided muscle weakness, vision problems, [[Raynaud's phenomenon|cold/bluish hands or feet]], stomach pain, bloody diarrhea, mental/mood changes, and [[Syncope (medicine)|fainting]]. In the unlikely event you have a serious allergic reaction to this drug, seek immediate medical attention. Symptoms of a [[anaphylaxis|serious allergic reaction]] include: rash, itching, swelling, severe dizziness, trouble breathing (swelling of the throat).

==Exclusivity==
In the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved naratriptan on February 11, 1998.<ref name=accessdata>FDA AccessData entry for [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/docs/obdetail.cfm?Appl_No=020763&TABLE1=OB_Rx Naratriptan Hydrochloride], accessed September 8, 2008</ref>  It was covered by {{US patent|4997841|U.S. Patent no. 4997841}}; the FDA lists the patent as expiring on July 7, 2010.<ref name=accessdata/><ref>{{US patent|4997841|U.S. Patent no. 4997841}}, Alexander W. Oxford, ''et al.'', ''Indole Derivatives'', March 5, 1991</ref>

In July 2010, in the wake of the patent expiration, several drug manufacturers, including [[Roxane Labs]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://drugstorenews.com/story.aspx?id=145645 |title=Roxane launches generic Amerge, Arimidex |first=Alaric |last=DeArment |work=Drug Store News |date=2010-07-09 |accessdate=2010-07-23}}</ref> [[Sandoz]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://drugstorenews.com/story.aspx?id=145817 |title=Sandoz launches generic Amerge |first=Alaric |last=DeArment |work=Drug Store News |date=2010-07-12 |accessdate=2010-07-23}}</ref> and [[Teva Pharmaceuticals]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://drugstorenews.com/story.aspx?id=146081 |title=Teva launches generic Amerge |first=Alaric |last=DeArment |work=Drug Store News |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2010-07-23}}</ref> announced that they were launching generic Naratriptan medications.

The drug continued to be covered by European patent 0303507 in Germany, Spain, France and the United Kingdom through March 10, 2012,<ref name=GenericsWeb>{{cite news |url=http://www.genericsweb.com/druginfocus/Naratriptan_press_release |title=Drug In Focus: Naratriptan |first=Dae |last=Oh |work=GenericsWeb |date=June 2010 |accessdate=2010-12-15}}</ref> and by Australian patent 611469 in Australia through June 17, 2013.<ref name=GenericsWeb/>  It had previously been covered by Canadian patent 1210968; but both Sandoz and Teva (formerly Novopharm) have offered generic equivalents in Canada since that patent's expiration December 1, 2009.<ref name=GenericsWeb/>

In December 23, 2014, in response to a request from [[Health Canada]], importers in Canada agreed to [[quarantine]] the importation of health products, including generic Naratriptan manufactured for both Sandoz and Teva, from [[Dr. Reddy's Laboratories]] in [[Srikakulam]], [[India]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Health products quarantined from two India sites |url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/compli-conform/info-prod/drugs-drogues/advisory-avis-drreddys_ipca-eng.php |website=Health Canada |publisher=Government of Canada |accessdate=September 14, 2017 |date=December 24, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Health products quarantined from two sites in India as Health Canada assesses data integrity concerns  |url=http://www.healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/hc-sc/2014/43061a-eng.php |website=Recalls and safety alerts |publisher=Health Canada |accessdate=September 14, 2017 |date=December 23, 2014}}</ref> Because Teva and Sandoz are the only approved suppliers of generic Naratriptan in Canada, the quarantine resulted in Naratriptan being placed on the Canadian drug shortage list.<ref name="pharmacompass">{{cite news |title=Dr. Reddy's largest API Facility Maybe the Next to Get Banned from Exporting to the United States |url=https://www.pharmacompass.com/radio-compass-blog/dr-reddy-s-largest-api-facility-maybe-the-next-to-get-banned-from-exporting-to-the-united-states |accessdate=September 14, 2017 |work=PharmaCompass |date=March 30, 2015 |language=en-gb}}</ref>
