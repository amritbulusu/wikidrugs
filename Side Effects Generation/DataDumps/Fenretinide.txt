'''Fenretinide''' (4-hydroxy(phenyl)retinamide; 4-HPR) ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) is a synthetic [[retinoid]] derivative. Retinoids are substances related to vitamin A.  It has been investigated for potential use in the treatment of [[cancer]], as well as in the treatment of [[cystic fibrosis]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Guilbault C, De Sanctis JB, Wojewodka G, Saeed Z, Lachance C, Skinner TA, Vilela RM, Kubow S, Lands LC, Hajduch M, Matouk E, Radzioch D | title = Fenretinide corrects newly found ceramide deficiency in cystic fibrosis | journal = American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–56 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 17656682 | doi = 10.1165/rcmb.2007-0036OC }}</ref> rheumatoid arthritis, acne, psoriasis, and has been found to also slow the production and accumulation of a toxin that leads to vision loss in Stargardt's patients.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Radu RA, Han Y, Bui TV, Nusinowitz S, Bok D, Lichter J, Widder K, Travis GH, Mata NL | title = Reductions in serum vitamin A arrest accumulation of toxic retinal fluorophores: a potential therapy for treatment of lipofuscin-based retinal diseases | journal = Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science | volume = 46 | issue = 12 | pages = 4393–401 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16303925 | doi = 10.1167/iovs.05-0820 }}</ref>

Specific types of cancer under investigation include or have included ovarian, prostate, cervical, lung, renal, bladder, breast, glioma, skin, head and neck carcinoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, neuroblastoma, and Ewing's sarcoma.
