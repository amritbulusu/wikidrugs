'''2C-T-21''' is a [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] [[phenethylamine]] of the [[2C's|2C family]].  It was first synthesized by [[Alexander Shulgin]], sometimes used as an [[entheogen]].  It was the first psychedelic drug known to contain six different [[chemical element]]s in the structure.

==Chemistry==

The full name of 2C-T-21 is '''4-(2-[[fluoro]][[ethyl group|ethyl]][[Thio-|thio]])-2,5-di[[methoxy]][[phenethylamine]]'''.

==Dosage==

In his book ''[[PiHKAL|PiHKAL (Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved)]]'', Shulgin lists the dosage range as 8–12&nbsp;mg.<ref>{{CitePiHKAL}}</ref>

==Effects==

2C-T-21 is generally taken orally, and effects typically last 7 to 14 hours.  The potential psychotherapeutic applications of this chemical were explored by [[Myron Stolaroff]] who found it a very promising substance in his experiments.

==Pharmacology==

The mechanism that produces 2C-T-21’s hallucinogenic and entheogenic effects has not been specifically established, however it is most likely to result from action as a [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]] [[5-HT receptor|serotonin receptor]] [[agonist]] in the brain, a mechanism of action shared by all of the hallucinogenic tryptamines and phenethylamines for which the mechanism of action is known. Based on the relatively high potency of 2C-T-21, it is likely that this compound binds quite strongly to the 5HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor target.

Fluoroacetate is produced by S-dealkylation of 2C-T-21.

==Dangers==

On March 9, 2004, a 22-year-old [[quadriplegic]] man named James Edwards Downs in St. Francisville, Louisiana, consumed an unknown dose of 2C-T-21 by sticking his tongue into a vial of powder he had purchased online. He developed a temperature of 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius),<ref name="urlNews from DEA, News Releases, 07/22/04">{{cite web |url=http://www.dea.gov/pubs/pressrel/pr072204.html |title=News from DEA, News Releases, 07/22/04 |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> had a [[tonic-clonic seizure]], and slipped into a coma.  Four days later, on March 13, Downs died at Lane Memorial Hospital in Zachary, LA.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

This death became part of a two-year DEA investigation called [[Operation Web Tryp]] which was launched in 2002. On July 22, 2004, the owners of American Chemical Supply were arrested on federal charges relating to distribution of [[Federal Analog Act|controlled substance analogues]] and the death of James Edwards Downs. Little is known about the toxicity of 2C-T-21 beyond this incident.

==Legality==

2C-T-21 is unscheduled and uncontrolled in the United States, but possession and sales of 2C-T-21 would probably be prosecuted under the [[Federal Analog Act]] because of its structural similarities to [[2C-T-7]] and its known potential to cause death. In the wake of [[Operation Web Tryp]] in July 2004, at least one "research chemical" distributor faced charges as a consequence of the death of James Downs from 2C-T-21 overdose.

===Canada===
As of October 31st, 2016; 2C-T-21 is a controlled substance (Schedule III) in Canada. http://gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2016/2016-05-04/html/sor-dors72-eng.php
