'''Tetrabenazine''' is a drug for the symptomatic treatment of [[Hyperkinesia|hyperkinetic]] [[movement disorders]]. It is marketed under the trade names '''Nitoman''' in [[Canada]] and '''Xenazine''' in [[New Zealand]], some parts of [[Europe]] and in the [[United States]] as an [[orphan drug]]. On August 15, 2008, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved the use of tetrabenazine to treat [[Chorea (disease)|chorea]] associated with [[Huntington's disease]]. Although other drugs had been used "[[off label]]," tetrabenazine was the first approved treatment for Huntington's disease in the U.S.<ref>[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jcxk0L9FfGM69AVQkohaYAUcrVlAD92J09SG0 1st US drug for Huntington's disease wins approval] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The compound has been known since the 1950s.

==Medical uses==
Tetrabenazine is used as a treatment, but not as a [[cure]], for hyperkinetic disorders<ref name="JankovicHyperkinectic">{{cite journal|vauthors=Jankovic J, Beach J |title=Long-term effects of tetrabenazine in hyperkinetic movement disorders|journal=Neurology|volume=48|issue=2|pages=358–62|year=1997|pmid=9040721|doi=10.1212/wnl.48.2.358}}</ref><ref name="pmid17133512">{{cite journal|vauthors=Kenney C, Hunter C, Jankovic J |title=Long-term tolerability of tetrabenazine in the treatment of hyperkinetic movement disorders|journal=Movement Disorders|volume=22|issue=2|pages=193–7|date=January 2007|pmid=17133512|doi=10.1002/mds.21222}}</ref> such as:
*[[Huntington's disease]] – specifically, the [[chorea]] associated with it
*[[Tourette syndrome]] and other [[tic disorder]]s

*[[Hemiballismus]], spontaneous flinging limb movements due to contra-lateral [[subthalamic nucleus]] damage

==Side effects==
The most common adverse reactions, which have occurred in at least 10% of subjects in studies and at least 5% greater than in subjects who received placebo, have been: sedation or somnolence, fatigue, insomnia, depression, suicidal thoughts, akathisia, anxiety and nausea.<ref name=PI/>

==Warnings==
There is a [[boxed warning]] associated with the use of tetrabenazine:<ref name=PI/>
*Increases the risk of depression and suicidal thoughts and behavior in patients with Huntington's disease
*Balance risks of depression and suicidality with the clinical need for control of chorea when considering the use of tetrabenazine
*Monitor patients for emergence or worsening of depression, suicidality or unusual changes in behavior
*Inform patients, caregivers and families of the risk of depression and suicidality and instruct to report behaviours of concern promptly to the treating physician
*Exercise caution when treating patients with a history of depression or prior suicide attempts or ideation
*Tetrabenazine is contraindicated in patients who are actively suicidal and in patients with untreated or inadequately treated depression

==Pharmacology==
The precise mechanism of action of tetrabenazine is unknown. Its anti-chorea effect is believed to be due to a reversible depletion of monoamines such as [[dopamine]], [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[histamine]] from nerve terminals. Tetrabenazine reversibly inhibits [[vesicular monoamine transporter 2]], resulting in decreased uptake of monamines into synaptic vesicles, as well as depletion of monoamine storage.<ref name=PI/>
