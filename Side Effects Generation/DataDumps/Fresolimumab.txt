'''Fresolimumab''' ('''GC1008''') is a [[human]] [[monoclonal antibody]]<ref>[http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/druginformation/innlists/PLFinal101.pdf WHO Drug Information]</ref> and an [[immunomodulator]]. It is intended for the treatment of [[idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis]] (IPF), [[focal segmental glomerulosclerosis]], and [[cancer]]<ref name=NCI>[http://www.cancer.gov/drugdictionary/?CdrID=530302 National Cancer Institute: Fresolimumab]</ref><ref>[http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/365/fresolimumab.pdf Statement On A Nonproprietary Name Adopted By The USAN Council – Fresolimumab]</ref> ([[kidney cancer]] and [[melanoma]]).

It binds to and inhibits all isoforms of the protein [[transforming growth factor beta]] (TGF-β).<ref name=NCI/>

==History==
Fresolimumab was discovered by [[Cambridge Antibody Technology]] (CAT) scientists<ref>{{Cite journal|title = A cytokine-neutralizing antibody as a structural mimetic of 2 receptor interactions|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/105/51/20251|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2008-12-23|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 2600578|pmid = 19073914|pages = 20251–20256|volume = 105|issue = 51|doi = 10.1073/pnas.0807200106|language = en|first = Christian|last = Grütter|first2 = Trevor|last2 = Wilkinson|first3 = Richard|last3 = Turner|first4 = Sadhana|last4 = Podichetty|first5 = Donna|last5 = Finch|first6 = Matthew|last6 = McCourt|first7 = Scott|last7 = Loning|first8 = Lutz|last8 = Jermutus|first9 = Markus G.|last9 = Grütter}}</ref> and was one of a pair of candidate drugs that were identified for the treatment of the fatal condition [[scleroderma]]. CAT chose to co-develop the two drugs [[metelimumab]] (CAT-192) and fresolimumab with [[Genzyme]]. During early development, around 2004, CAT decided to drop development of metelimumab in favour of fresolimumab.<ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/cat-may-abandon-skin-drug-after-trial-results-disappoint-569445.html</ref>

In February 2011 [[Sanofi-Aventis]] agreed to buy Genzyme for US$20.1 billion.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12477750</ref>

{{as of|June 2011}} the drug was being tested in humans ([[clinical trials]]) against IPF, renal disease, and cancer.<ref>http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/scientists-trigger-white-fat-to-become-brown-fat-like-to-treat-obesty-and-type-2-diabetes/81245389/</ref><ref>[http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=Fresolimumab Clinicaltrials.gov for Fresolimumab]</ref> On 13 August 2012, Genzyme applied to begin a Phase 2 clinical trial in primary focal segmental [[glomerulosclerosis]]<ref>http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01665391</ref> comparing fresolimumab versus [[placebo]].

{{As of|2014|7}}, Sanofi-Aventis continue to list fresolimumab in their research and development portfolio under Phase II development.<ref>http://en.sanofi.com/rd/rd_portfolio/rd_portfolio.aspx</ref>
