==Medical uses==
OHPC is used in the treatment of [[threatened miscarriage]], [[gynecological disorder]]s such as [[dysmenorrhea]], [[premenstrual syndrome]], [[fibrocystic breast disease]], [[adenosis]], and [[breast pain]], and [[endometrial cancer]].<ref name="FeghaliVenkataramanan2014" /> It was used widely in the 1950s through the 1970s for these indications, but OHPC more recently has received the most attention in the prevention of [[preterm birth]].<ref name="FeghaliVenkataramanan2014" />

===Preterm birth===
The use of OHPC in pregnancy to prevent [[preterm birth]] in women with a history of preterm delivery between 20 weeks and 36 weeks and 6 days is supported by the Society of Maternal Fetal Medicine Clinic Guidelines put out in May 2012 as Level I and III evidence, Level A recommendation.<ref>SMFM Clinical Guideline: Progesterone and preterm birth prevention: translating clinical trials data into clinical practice, AJOG May 2012</ref> Level I evidence refers to a properly powered [[randomized controlled trial]], and level III evidence is support from expert opinion, while a Level A recommendation confers that the recommendation is made based on good and consistent scientific evidence. OHPC 250&nbsp;mg IM weekly preferably starting at 16–20 weeks until 36 weeks is recommended. In these women, if the transvaginal ultrasound cervical length shortens to <25&nbsp;mm at < 24 weeks, [[Cerclage|cervical cerclage]] may be offered. In the 2013 study the guideline recommendation is based on,<ref>Meirs et al. NEJM 2003</ref> there was also a significant decrease of neonatal morbidity including lower rates of [[necrotizing enterocolitis]] (0 in the treatment group vs 4 in the control), [[intraventricular hemorrhage]] (4 in the treatment group compared with 8 in the control for a relative risk of 0.25), and need for supplemental oxygen (14% in the treatment group vs 24% in the placebo for a relative risk of 0.42). Furthermore, this study contained 463 patients, 310 of whom received injection. Of these patients, 9 had infants with congenital malformations (2%), but there was no consistent pattern and none involved internal organs.

OHPC is currently (as of June 2014) [[pregnancy category]] B, meaning there is no evidence of fetal risk with use of this drug during pregnancy. Although this is now the recommendation, this has not always been the case. A 2006 [[Cochrane Review]] concluded "...important maternal and infant outcomes have been poorly reported to date... information regarding the potential harms of progesterone therapy to prevent preterm birth is limited".<ref>Dodd JM, Flenady V, Cincotta R, Crowther CA; ''The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews'' 2006 Issue 1</ref> There was a similar conclusion from a review by Marc Keirse of [[Flinders University]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Keirse | first1 = MJNC | last2 = Progesterone | year = 2004 | title = déjà vu" or "still to be seen"?. | url = | journal = Birth | volume = 31 | issue = | page = 3 }}</ref> Three clinical studies in singleton pregnancies of 250&nbsp;mg/week of [[intramuscular injection|intramuscular]] OHPC have all shown a trend for an increase in pregnancy loss due to miscarriage compared to placebo.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = JWC | last2 = Austin | first2 = KL | last3 = Jones | first3 = GS | last4 = Davis | first4 = GH | last5 = King | first5 = TM | year = 1975 | title = Efficacy of 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate in the prevention of premature labor | url = | journal = NEJM | volume = 293 | issue = 14| pages = 675–680 | doi=10.1056/nejm197510022931401}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Yemini | first1 = M | last2 = Borenstein | first2 = R | last3 = Dreazen | display-authors = etal   | year = 1985 | title = Prevention of premature labor by 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate | url = | journal = Am J Obstet Gynecol | volume = 151 | issue = 5| pages = 574–7 | doi=10.1016/0002-9378(85)90141-3}}</ref><ref name=nih2003>{{cite journal|author=Meis PJ|author2=Klebanoff M|author3=Thom E|author4=Dombrowski MP|author5=Sibai B|author6=Moawad AH|author7=Spong CY|author8= Hauth JC|author9=Miodovnik M|author10=Varner MW|author11=Leveno KJ|author12=Caritis SN|author13=Iams JD|author14=Wapner RJ|author15=Conway D|author16=O'Sullivan MJ|author17=Carpenter M|author18= Mercer B|author19=Ramin SM|author20= Thorp JM|author21=Peaceman AM|author22=Gabbe S|author23=National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network.|title=Prevention of recurrent preterm delivery by 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate.|journal=N Engl J Med. |pmid=12802023| year=2003| volume=348| issue=24| pages=2379–85| doi=10.1056/NEJMoa035140}}</ref> One of them, a large NIH study in 2003, looked at the effect of OHPC injections in women at risk for repeat premature birth and found that the treated group experienced premature birth in 37% versus 55% in the controls.<ref name=nih2003 /> A follow-up study of the offspring showed no evidence that OHPC affected the children in the first years of life.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Northen AT| author2=Norman GS| author3=Anderson K| author4=Moseley L| author5=Divito M| author6=Cotroneo M| author7=Swain M| author8=Bousleiman S| author9=Johnson F| author10= Dorman K| author11=Milluzzi C| author12=Tillinghast JA| author13=Kerr M| author14=Mallett G| author15=Thom E| author16=Pagliaro S| author17=Anderson GD|author18=National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU) Network.| title=Follow-up of children exposed in utero to 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate compared with placebo|journal=Obstet Gynecol.| pmid=17906021| year=2007| volume=110| issue=4| pages=865–72| doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000281348.51499.bc}}</ref> Based on these NIH data, 17 OHPC was approved by the FDA in 2011 as a drug to reduce the risk of premature birth in selected patients at risk.

A study published in February 2016 in ''The Lancet'' stated the below, amongst other findings:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Norman|first=Jane Elizabeth|last2=Marlow|first2=Neil|last3=Messow|first3=Claudia-Martina|last4=Shennan|first4=Andrew|last5=Bennett|first5=Phillip R|last6=Thornton|first6=Steven|last7=Robson|first7=Stephen C|last8=McConnachie|first8=Alex|last9=Petrou|first9=Stavros|date=2016-05-21|title=Vaginal progesterone prophylaxis for preterm birth (the OPPTIMUM study): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind trial|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)00350-0/fulltext|journal=The Lancet|language=English|volume=387|issue=10033|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00350-0|issn=0140-6736|pages=2106–2116|pmid=26921136}}</ref>

{{Quotation|OPPTIMUM strongly suggests that the efficacy of progesterone in improving outcomes is either non-existent or weak. Given the heterogeneity of the preterm labour syndrome we cannot exclude benefit in specific phenotypic or genotypic subgroups of women at risk. However, the subgroups of women who might benefit do not appear to be easily identifiable by current selection strategies, including cervical length measurement and fibronectin testing.

Reassuringly, our study suggests that progesterone is safe for those who wish to take it for preterm birth prophylaxis. The overall rate of maternal or child adverse events was similar in the progesterone and placebo groups. There were few differences in the incidence of adverse secondary outcomes in the two groups, with the exception of a higher rate of renal, gastrointestinal, and respiratory complications in childhood in the progesterone groups. Importantly, the absolute rates of these complications was low. Follow-up of other babies exposed in utero to vaginal progesterone would be helpful in determining whether the increased rate of some renal, gastrointestinal, and respiratory complications is a real effect or a type I error.}}

The journal reviewer Richard Lehman, senior Research Fellow at the Department of Primary Health Care at the University of Oxford made the following notable commentary on the OPPTIMUM study, "That's it. This story is ended, and nobody need ever use vaginal progesterone again to prevent preterm birth."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2016/05/23/richard-lehmans-journal-review-23-may-2016/|title=BMJ Blogs: The BMJ  » Blog Archive   » Richard Lehman’s journal review—23 May 2016|website=blogs.bmj.com|access-date=2016-05-25}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==

===Progestogen===
OHPC, unlike many other progestins, is very similar to natural progesterone both structurally and pharmacologically, and is a pure progestogen – that is, a highly selective [[agonist]] of the [[progesterone receptor]] (PR), without other [[hormonal]] activities. However, relative to progesterone, OHPC has improved [[pharmacokinetics]], namely, a much longer duration with [[depot injection]]. Via intramuscular injection, 250&nbsp;mg OHPC is said to be equivalent to 50&nbsp;mg of [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]].<ref name="Kistner1960">{{cite journal|last1=Kistner|first1=Robert W.|title=The Use of Progestational Agents in Obstetrics and Gynecology|journal=Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=3|issue=4|year=1960|pages=1047–1067|issn=0009-9201|doi=10.1097/00003081-196003040-00019|quote=50 mg of [medroxyprogesterone acetate], intramuscularly, is equivalent to 250 mg [hydroxyprogesterone caproate]}}</ref>

In animals, the [[bioavailability]] of OHPC with intramuscular injection is nearly 100%, but its oral bioavailability is very low at less than 3%.<ref name="ShaikBastian2015">{{cite journal|last1=Shaik|first1=Imam H.|last2=Bastian|first2=Jaime R.|last3=Zhao|first3=Yang|last4=Caritis|first4=Steve N.|last5=Venkataramanan|first5=Raman|title=Route of administration and formulation dependent pharmacokinetics of 17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate in rats|journal=Xenobiotica|volume=46|issue=2|year=2015|pages=169–174|issn=0049-8254|doi=10.3109/00498254.2015.1057547}}</ref> For this reason, oral administration is unfeasible for medical use.<ref name="ShaikBastian2015" />

===Metabolism===
The [[caproate]] [[ester]] of OHPC is not cleaved from it during [[metabolism]], so the drug is not converted ''[[in vivo]]'' to [[17α-hydroxyprogesterone]] (17α-OHP), nor to [[progesterone]]; that is, it is not a [[prodrug]] of 17α-OHP or progesterone.<ref name="pmid18060946">{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Attardi BJ, Zeleznik A, Simhan H, Chiao JP, Mattison DR, Caritis SN | title = Comparison of progesterone and glucocorticoid receptor binding and stimulation of gene expression by progesterone, 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate, and related progestins | journal = Am.

The FDA then announced that pharmacies could continue to compound the drug at their usual cost of $10~20 per dose without fear of legal reprisals.,<ref>http://www.macleans.ca/article.jsp?content=w6411446</ref> and KV reduced its price to $690 per dose.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2011/04/02/price_of_preterm_birth_medicine_cut/| publisher=Boston.com |agency=Associated Press| title=Price of preterm birth medicine cut |date=April 2, 2011 |accessdate=April 2, 2011}}</ref>
