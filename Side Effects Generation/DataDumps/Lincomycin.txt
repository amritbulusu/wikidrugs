== Uses ==

Although similar in structure, antibacterial spectrum, and [[mechanism of action]] to [[macrolides]], lincomycin is also effective against other organisms including [[actinomycete]]s and some species of ''[[Mycoplasma]]'' and ''[[Plasmodium]]''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

However, because of its adverse effects and toxicity, it is rarely used today and reserved for patients allergic to [[penicillin]] or where bacteria have developed [[Antibiotic resistance|resistance]].

== Clinical pharmacology ==

Intramuscular administration of a single dose of 600&nbsp;mg of Lincomycin produces average peak serum levels of 11.6&nbsp;µg/mL at 60&nbsp;min, and maintains therapeutic levels for 17&nbsp;h to 20&nbsp;h, for most susceptible gram-positive organisms.  Urinary excretion after this dose ranges from 1.8% to 24.8% (mean: 17.3%).

A two-hour intravenous infusion of 600&nbsp;mg of Lincomycin achieves average peak serum levels of 15.9&nbsp;µg/mL and yields therapeutic levels for 14&nbsp;h for most susceptible gram-positive organisms.  Urinary excretion ranges from 4.9% to 30.3% (mean: 13.8%).

The biological half-life after IM or IV administration is 5.4 ± 1.0&nbsp;h.  The serum half-life of lincomycin may be prolonged in patients with severe impairment of renal function, compared to patients with normal renal function.  In patients with abnormal hepatic function, serum half-life may be twofold longer than in patients with normal hepatic function.  [[Hemodialysis]] and [[peritoneal dialysis]] are not effective in removing lincomycin from the serum.

Tissue level studies indicate that [[bile]] is an important route of excretion.  Significant levels have been demonstrated in the majority of body tissues.  Although lincomycin appears to diffuse in the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF), levels of lincomycin in the CSF appear inadequate for the treatment of meningitis.

== Biosynthesis ==

Lincomycin is an [[antibiotic]] classified as a constituent of the lincosamide group, which typically feature a 6,8-dideoxy-6-aminooctose lincosamine.<ref name="pmid14593504">{{cite journal |vauthors=Spízek J, Rezanka T |title=Lincomycin, cultivation of producing strains and biosynthesis |journal=Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. |volume=63 |issue=5 |pages=510–9 |date=February 2004 |pmid=14593504 |doi=10.1007/s00253-003-1431-3}}</ref> In Lincomycin A, this [[sugar]] moiety (referred to as methylthiolincosamide) is linked via an amide bond to an amino acid derivative (referred to as propylhygric acid). Lincomycin [[biosynthesis]] occurs via a biphasic pathway. Propylproline and methylthiolincosamide are each synthesized separately, which are then [[condensation reaction|condensed]] to form ''N''-demethyllincomycin and finally [[methylation|methylated]] by [[S-adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] to give lincomycin.

In the biosynthesis of the [[amino acid]] moiety of lincomycin, [[tyrosine]] comprises seven of the nine [[carbons]] in the prophylhygric acid, while the remaining two carbons are added in reactions with ''S''-adenosyl methionine.<ref name="pmid5809230">{{cite journal |vauthors=Argoudelis AD, Eble TE, Fox JA, Mason DJ |title=Studies on the biosynthesis of lincomycin.

Although the multistep conversion of dihydroxyphenylalanine to propylproline remains unknown, experiments involving accumulation of 1,2,3,6-tetradehydro-propylproline in mutants lacking a reductase requiring lincomycin cosynthetic factor suggests a biosynthetic scheme that Kuo and coworkers have modified from Brahme et al.<ref name="Brahme" /><ref name="Brahme_a" /> to accommodate the remaining steps leading to propylproline.<ref name="pmid2708143">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kuo MS, Yurek DA, Coats JH, Li GP |title=Isolation and identification of 7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin, an unusual cosynthetic factor in streptomycetes, from Streptomyces lincolnensis |journal=J.

The biosynthetic pathway for production of the methythiolincosamide sugar moiety is still not entirely known, although two different pathways have been predicted.<ref name="Brahme_a" /><ref name="pmid8577249">{{cite journal |vauthors=Peschke U, Schmidt H, Zhang HZ, Piepersberg W |title=Molecular characterization of the lincomycin-production gene cluster of Streptomyces lincolnensis 78-11 |journal=Mol.

Once condensed, an octose (C8) unit is formed that can undergo [[isomerization]] to octose, dephosphorylation and reduction of the C8 carbon, transamination of 6-ketooctose, and thiomethylation of C1 to finally convert the octose unit to the methylthiolincosamide. A substantially different pathway for the formation of the methythiolincosamide proposes that its biosynthesis involves nucleotide activation followed by a series of modifications of dNTP-activated sugar intermediates. Eight genes, lmb-LMNZPOSQ, have been found to form a "sugar subcluster" which might be involved in this sugar metabolism.<ref name="pmid1661369">{{cite journal |vauthors=Pissowotzki K, Mansouri K, Piepersberg W |title=Genetics of streptomycin production in Streptomyces griseus: molecular structure and putative function of genes strELMB2N |journal=Mol.

Condensation of the carboxyl group on the propylproline with the amine group of the methylthiolincosamide via an amide bond is catalyzed by ''N''-Demethyllincomycin-synthetase. The resulting ''N''-demethyllincomycin is then methylated by ''S''-adenosyl methionine through ''N''-Demethyllincomycin methyl transferase to form the final lincomycin product.<ref>Patt TE, Horvath BA (1985) Isolation and characterization of Ndemethyllincomycin methyltransferase.

== Spectrum of susceptibility ==
Lincomycin is a narrow spectrum antibiotic with activity against Gram-positive and cell wall-less bacteria including pathogenic species of ''Streptococcus'', ''Staphylococcus,'' and ''Mycoplasma''.<ref>http://www.rxlist.com/lincocin-drug/indications-dosage.htm</ref> Lincomycin is used to treat severe bacterial infections in patients who cannot use penicillin antibiotics.<ref>http://www.gmedication.com/?s=lincocin</ref> Lincomycin shows weak activity against most Gram-negative bacteria. The following represents susceptibility ([[minimum inhibitory concentration|MIC]]) data for a few pathogenic bacteria:
* ''Staphylococcus aureus'' - 0.2&nbsp;µg/mL - 32&nbsp;µg/mL
* ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'' - 0.05&nbsp;µg/mL - 0.4&nbsp;µg/mL<ref>http://www.toku-e.com/Assets/MIC/Lincomycin%20HCl%20EP.pdf</ref>
