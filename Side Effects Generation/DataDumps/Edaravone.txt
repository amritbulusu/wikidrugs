'''Edaravone''', sold as under the brand names '''Radicava''' and '''Radicut''', is an intravenous medication used to help with [[stroke recovery|recovery]] following a [[stroke]]<ref name=Miyaji2015>{{cite journal|last1=Miyaji|first1=Y|last2=Yoshimura|first2=S|last3=Sakai|first3=N|last4=Yamagami|first4=H|last5=Egashira|first5=Y|last6=Shirakawa|first6=M|last7=Uchida|first7=K|last8=Kageyama|first8=H|last9=Tomogane|first9=Y|title=Effect of edaravone on favorable outcome in patients with acute cerebral large vessel occlusion: subanalysis of RESCUE-Japan Registry.|journal=Neurologia medico-chirurgica|date=2015|volume=55|issue=3|pages=241–7|pmid=25739433|pmc=4533339|doi=10.2176/nmc.ra.2014-0219}}</ref> and to treat [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS).<ref name=USlabel2017>{{cite web|title=US Label: Edaravone|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/209176lbl.pdf|publisher=FDA|date=May 2017}} For label updates see [https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=overview.process&ApplNo=209176 FDA index page for NDA 209176]</ref>

The label carries a warning about the potential for hypersensitivity reactions to edaravone, and adverse effects include bruising, gait disturbances, headache, skin inflammation, eczema, problems breathing, excess sugar in urine, and fungal skin infections.<ref name=USlabel2017/>

The mechanism by which edaravone might be effective is unknown.<ref name=USlabel2017/>  The drug is known to be an antioxidant, and oxidative stress has been hypothesized to be part of the process that kills neurons in people with ALS.<ref name=Petrov2017/>

==Medical uses==
Edaravone is used to help people recover from stroke in Japan,<ref name=Miyaji2015/> and is used to treat ALS in the US and Japan.<ref name=USlabel2017/><ref name=Petrov2017/>  It was approved for ALS in the US in 2017 based on a small randomized controlled clinical trial with people who had early-stage ALS in Japan, who were administered the drug for 6 months; it had failed two earlier trials in people with all stages of ALS.<ref name=USlabel2017/><ref name=Petrov2017>{{cite journal|last1=Petrov|first1=D|last2=Mansfield|first2=C|last3=Moussy|first3=A|last4=Hermine|first4=O|title=ALS Clinical Trials Review: 20 Years of Failure.

It is given by [[intravenous infusion]].<ref name=USlabel2017/>

There is no data on whether it is safe for pregnant women to take, and it is unknown if edaravone is secreted in breast milk.<ref name=USlabel2017/>

==Adverse effects==
The label carries a warning about the potential for hypersensitivity reactions to edaravone.<ref name=USlabel2017/>

The following adverse effects in at least 2% more people given the drug than were given placebo: bruising, gait disturbances, headache, skin inflammation, eczema, problems breathing, excess sugar in urine, and fungal skin infections.<ref name=USlabel2017/>

==Pharmacology==
The mechanism by which edaravone might be effective in ALS is unknown.<ref name=USlabel2017/>  The drug is known to be an antioxidant, and oxidative stress has been hypothesized to be part of the process that kills neurons in people with ALS.<ref name=Petrov2017/>

The half-life of edaravone is 4.5 to 6 hours and the half-lives of its metabolites are 2 to 3 hours. It is metabolized to a sulfate conjugate and a [[glucuronide]] conjugate, neither of which are active.  It is primarily excreted in urine as the glucuronide conjugate form.<ref name=USlabel2017/>

==History==
Researchers first developed the free radical scavenger edaravone in late 1980s as a treatment for stroke. The approach, introduced by Koji Abe, now at Okayama University Hospital in Japan, aimed to prevent the swelling of the brain which may occur after a stroke.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.alsresearchforum.org/fda-approves-edaravone-as-a-treatment-for-als-2/?platform=hootsuite|title=FDA Approves Edaravone as a Treatment for ALS|website=Research ALS|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-10}}</ref>

It has been marketed in [[Japan]] by [[Mitsubishi Pharma]] for stroke since 2001 and is now generic.<ref name=Miyaji2015/><ref name=Herper/>

Mitsubishi Tanabe started a phase III clinical trial in ALS in 2011 in Japan and by June 2015, it had been approved for that use in Japan.  The company had received Orphan Drug Designation for edaravone from the FDA and EU by 2016.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lane|first1=EJ|title=Mitsubishi Tanabe says ALS drug meets PhIII endpoint|url=http://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma-asia/mitsubishi-tanabe-says-als-drug-meets-phiii-endpoint|work=FiercePharma|date=April 20, 2016|language=en}}</ref>

In May 2017, I.V. edaravone was approved by the FDA to treat people with [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm557102.htm?source=govdelivery|title=Press Announcements - FDA approves drug to treat ALS|last=Commissioner|first=Office of the|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-07}}</ref>  The FDA approval was conditioned on Mitsubishi Tanabe completing several additional studies to clarify the risks of cancer and liver disease, among other effects of the drug.<ref>{{cite web|title=NDA 209176  Approval letter|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2017/209176Orig1s000ltr.pdf|publisher=FDA|date=May 5, 2017}}</ref>
