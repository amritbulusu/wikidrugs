'''Indole''' is an [[aromatic]] [[Heterocyclic compound|heterocyclic]] [[organic compound]] with formula [[Carbon|C]]<sub>8</sub>[[Hydrogen|H]]<sub>7</sub>[[Nitrogen|N]]. It has a bicyclic structure, consisting of a six-membered [[benzene]] ring fused to a five-membered [[nitrogen]]-containing [[pyrrole]] ring. Indole is widely distributed in the natural environment and can be produced by a variety of [[bacteria]]. As an [[Cell signaling|intercellular signal molecule]], indole regulates various aspects of bacterial physiology, including [[Bacterial spore|spore]] formation, [[plasmid]] stability, [[drug resistance|resistance to drugs]], [[biofilm]] formation, and [[virulence]].<ref name="LeeLee2010">{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Jin-Hyung|last2=Lee|first2=Jintae|title=Indole as an intercellular signal in microbial communities|journal=FEMS Microbiology Reviews|year=2010|issn=0168-6445|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2009.00204.x}}</ref> The [[amino acid]] [[tryptophan]] is an indole derivative and the precursor of the [[neurotransmitter]] [[serotonin]].<ref name=Lehninger/>

== General properties and occurrence ==
Indole is a [[solid]] at room temperature. Indole can be produced by bacteria as a degradation product of the amino acid [[tryptophan]]. It occurs naturally in human [[feces]] and has an intense fecal [[odor]]. At very low concentrations, however, it has a flowery smell,<ref name="smell">http://www.leffingwell.com/olfact5.htm<!-- there might be better references for its odor properties --></ref> and is a constituent of many flower [[scent]]s (such as orange blossoms) and [[perfumes]]. It also occurs in [[coal tar]].

The corresponding [[substituent]] is called '''indolyl'''.

Indole undergoes [[electrophilic substitution]], mainly at position 3 (see diagram in right margin). [[Substituted indoles]] are structural elements of (and for some compounds, the synthetic precursors for) the tryptophan-derived [[tryptamine]] alkaloids like the [[neurotransmitter]] [[serotonin]], and [[melatonin]]. Other indolic compounds include the plant hormone [[auxin]] (indolyl-3-acetic acid, [[Indole-3-acetic acid|IAA]]), [[tryptophol]], the anti-inflammatory drug [[indomethacin]], the [[betablocker]] [[pindolol]], and the naturally occurring hallucinogen [[dimethyltryptamine]].

The name ''indole'' is a [[Portmanteau word|portmanteau]] of the words ''[[indigo dye|'''ind'''igo]]'' and ''[[oleum|'''ole'''um]]'', since indole was first isolated by treatment of the indigo dye with oleum.

==History==
[[File:Baeyer indole structure.png|left|thumb|120px|Baeyer's original structure for indole, 1869]]
Indole chemistry began to develop with the study of the dye [[indigo dye|indigo]]. Indigo can be converted to [[isatin]] and then to [[oxindole]]. Then, in 1866, [[Adolf von Baeyer]] reduced [[oxindole]] to indole using [[zinc]] dust.<ref name="baeyer1866">{{cite journal|author-link = Adolf von Baeyer|last=Baeyer |first=A.|journal = Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie|year = 1866|volume = 140|pages = 295–296|doi = 10.1002/jlac.18661400306|title = Ueber die Reduction aromatischer Verbindungen mittelst Zinkstaub|trans_title=On the reduction of aromatic compounds by means of zinc dust|issue = 3|url=https://archive.org/stream/annalenderchemi11liebgoog#page/n690/mode/2up}}</ref> In 1869, he proposed a formula for indole (left).<ref name="baeyer1869">{{cite journal|author-link = Adolf von Baeyer|last=Baeyer |first=A. |last2=Emmerling |first2=A.|journal = Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft|year = 1869|volume = 2|pages = 679–682|doi = 10.1002/cber.186900201268|title = Synthese des Indols|trans_title=Synthesis of indole|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3481747;view=1up;seq=709}}</ref>

Certain indole derivatives were important dyestuffs until the end of the 19th century. In the 1930s, interest in indole intensified when it became known that the indole substituent is present in many important [[alkaloid]]s (e.g., [[tryptophan]] and [[auxin]]s), and it remains an active area of research today.<ref name="vanorder1942">{{cite journal|first1=R. B. |last1=Van Order |first2=H. G. |last2=Lindwall |journal = [[Chem. Rev.]]|year = 1942|volume = 30|pages = 69–96|doi = 10.1021/cr60095a004|title = Indole}}</ref>

==Occurrence in nature==
Indole is [[Biosynthesis|biosynthesized]] via [[anthranilic acid|anthranilate]].<ref name=Lehninger>{{Lehninger4th}}</ref> It condenses with [[serine]] by [[Michael addition]] of indole to [[serine dehydratase|PLP-aminoacrylate]].
:[[File:Tryptophan biosynthesis (en).svg|left|480px|thumb|Indole is produced via anthranilate and is alkylated to give the amino acid tryptophan.]]{{clear left}}

As an [[Cell signaling|intercellular signal molecule]], indole regulates various aspects of bacterial physiology, including [[Bacterial spore|spore]] formation, [[plasmid]] stability, [[drug resistance|resistance to drugs]], [[biofilm]] formation, and [[virulence]].<ref name="LeeLee2010" /> The [[amino acid]] [[tryptophan]] is an indole derivative and the precursor of the [[neurotransmitter]] [[serotonin]].<ref name="Lehninger" />

Indole is a major constituent of [[coal tar]], and the 220–260&nbsp;°C distillation fraction is the main industrial source of the material.

==Synthetic routes==
Indole and its derivatives can also be synthesized by a variety of methods.<ref name="gribble2000">{{cite journal|last = Gribble|first= G. W.|journal = [[J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1]] |year = 2000|doi = 10.1039/a909834h|title = Recent developments in indole ring synthesis—methodology and applications|page = 1045|issue = 7}}</ref><ref name="cacchi2005">{{cite journal|last1=Cacchi |first1=S. |last2=Fabrizi |first2=G. |journal = [[Chem.

The main industrial routes start from [[aniline]] via vapor-phase reaction with [[ethylene glycol]] in the presence of [[catalyst]]s:

:[[File:Indole from aniline and ethylene glycol.jpg|350px|Reaction of [[aniline]] and [[ethylene glycol]] to give indole.]]

In general, reactions are conducted between 200 and 500&nbsp;°C. Yields can be as high as 60%. Other precursors to indole include [[formyltoluidine]], 2-ethylaniline, and 2-(2-nitrophenyl)ethanol, all of which undergo [[Cyclization reaction|cyclizations]].<ref>{{Ullmann|first1=Gerd |last1=Collin |first2=Hartmut |last2=Höke |title=Indole |doi=10.1002/14356007.a14_167}}</ref> Many other methods have been developed.

<!-- Significant synthetic methods -->
===Leimgruber–Batcho indole synthesis===
{{main|Leimgruber–Batcho indole synthesis}}
:[[File:Leimgruber-Batcho Indole Scheme.png|500px|The Leimgruber–Batcho indole synthesis]]
The [[Leimgruber–Batcho indole synthesis]] is an efficient method of synthesizing indole and substituted indoles.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Originally disclosed in a patent in 1976, this method is high-yielding and can generate substituted indoles. This method is especially popular in the [[pharmaceutical industry]], where many pharmaceutical [[medication|drugs]] are made up of specifically substituted indoles.

===Fischer indole synthesis===
{{main|Fischer indole synthesis}}
:[[File:Fischer Indole Reaction Scheme.png|400px|The Fischer indole synthesis]]
[[File:One-pot synthesis of indoles.svg|thumb|370px|One-pot microwave-assisted synthesis of indole from phenylhydrazine and pyruvic acid]]
One of the oldest and most reliable methods for synthesizing substituted indoles is the [[Fischer indole synthesis]], developed in 1883 by [[Hermann Emil Fischer|Emil Fischer]]. Although the synthesis of indole itself is problematic using the Fischer indole synthesis, it is often used to generate indoles substituted in the 2- and/or 3-positions. Indole can still be synthesized, however, using the Fischer indole synthesis by reacting [[phenylhydrazine]] with [[pyruvic acid]] followed by [[decarboxylation]] of the formed indole-2-carboxylic acid. This has also been accomplished in a one-pot synthesis using microwave irradiation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bratulescu|first1=George|title=A new and efficient one-pot synthesis of indoles|journal=Tetrahedron Letters|volume=49|page=984|year=2008|doi=10.1016/j.tetlet.2007.12.015|issue=6 }}</ref>

With other solvents, other products are formed: with [[glacial acetic acid]] a [[pyrazolone]], and with [[pyridine]] a [[quinoline]].

==Chemical reactions of indole==
===Basicity===
Unlike most [[amine]]s, indole is not [[Base (chemistry)|basic]]. The bonding situation is analogous to that in [[pyrrole]]. Strong acids such as [[hydrochloric acid]] can [[Protonation|protonate]] indole. Indole is primarily protonated at the C3, rather than N1, owing to the [[enamine]]-like reactivity of the portion of the molecule located outside of the [[benzene]] ring. The protonated form has an [[Acid dissociation constant|p''K''<sub>a</sub>]] of −3.6. The sensitivity of many indolic compounds (e.g., [[tryptamine]]s) under acidic conditions is caused by this protonation.

===Electrophilic substitution===
The most reactive position on indole for [[electrophilic aromatic substitution]] is C3, which is 10<sup>13</sup> times more reactive <!--toward what--> than [[benzene]]. <!--one cannot compare a site and a molecule--> For example, it is alkylated by phosphorylated serine in the biosynthesis of the amino acid tryptophan (see figure above). [[Vilsmeier-Haack reaction|Vilsmeier–Haack]] [[formylation reaction|formylation]] of indole<ref name="james1959">{{cite journal|last1=James |first1=P. N. |last2=Snyder |first2=H. R. |year=1959|title=Indole-3-aldehyde |journal=[[Organic Syntheses]]|volume=39|page=30| url=http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/prep.asp?prep=cv4p0539|doi=10.15227/orgsyn.039.0030}}</ref> will take place at room temperature exclusively at C3.

:[[File:Indole Vilsmeyer-Haack Formylation.png|300px|The Vilsmeyer–Haack formylation of indole]]

Since the pyrrollic ring is the most reactive portion of indole, electrophilic substitution of the carbocyclic (benzene) ring generally takes place only after N1, C2, and C3 are substituted. A noteworthy exception occurs when electrophilic substitution is carried out in conditions sufficiently acidic to exhaustively protonate C3.  In this case, C5 is the most common site of electrophilic attack.<ref name="noland1966">{{cite journal |last=Noland |first=W. E. |last2=Rush |first2=K. R. |last3=Smith |first3=L. R. |year=1966 |title=Nitration of Indoles. IV. The Nitration of 2-Phenylindole. |journal=[[Journal of Organic Chemistry|J. Org.

[[Gramine]], a useful synthetic intermediate, is produced via a [[Mannich reaction]] of indole with [[dimethylamine]] and [[formaldehyde]]. It is the precursor to indole-3-acetic acid and synthetic tryptophan.

:[[File:Gramine From Indole Scheme.png|250px|Synthesis of gramine from indole]]

===N–H acidity and organometallic indole anion complexes===
The N–H center has a p''K''<sub>a</sub> of 21 in [[dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]], so that very [[strong base]]s such as [[sodium hydride]] or [[N-Butyllithium|''n''-butyl lithium]] and water-free conditions are required for complete [[deprotonation]]. The resulting [[Organometallic chemistry|organometalic]] derivatives can react in two ways. The more [[ionic bond|ionic]] salts such as the [[sodium]] or [[potassium]] compounds tend to react with [[electrophile]]s at nitrogen-1, whereas the more [[Covalent bond|covalent]] magnesium compounds (''indole [[Grignard reaction|Grignard reagents]]'') and (especially) [[zinc]] complexes tend to react at carbon 3 (see figure below). In analogous fashion, [[Chemical polarity|polar]] aprotic [[solvent]]s such as [[dimethylformamide|DMF]] and [[Dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]] tend to favour attack at the nitrogen, whereas nonpolar solvents such as [[toluene]] favour C3 attack.<ref name="heaney1974">{{cite journal|last1=Heaney |first1=H. |last2=Ley |first2=S. V. |year=1974|title=1-Benzylindole |journal=[[Organic Syntheses]]|volume=54|page=58| url=http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/prep.asp?prep=cv6p0104|doi=10.15227/orgsyn.054.0058}}</ref>

:[[File:Indole anion reactions.png|400px|Formation and reactions of the indole anion]]

===Carbon acidity and C2 lithiation===

After the N–H proton, the hydrogen at C2 is the next most acidic proton on indole. Reaction of ''N''-protected indoles with [[N-Butyllithium|butyl lithium]] or [[lithium diisopropylamide]] results in lithiation exclusively at the C2 position. This strong nucleophile can then be used as such with other electrophiles.

Bergman and Venemalm developed a technique for lithiating the 2-position of unsubstituted indole.<ref name="bergman1992">{{cite journal|author1=Bergman, J. |author2=Venemalm, L. |journal = [[J. Org. Chem.]]|doi = 10.1021/jo00034a058|title = Efficient synthesis of 2-chloro-, 2-bromo-, and 2-iodoindole|year = 1992|volume = 57|page = 2495|issue = 8}}</ref>

:[[File:Bergman Indole Lithiation.png|400px|2-position lithiation of indole]]

Alan Katritzky also developed a technique for lithiating the 2-position of unsubstituted indole.<ref>{{cite journal|title = Facile Synthesis of 2-Substituted Indoles and Indolo[3,2-''b'']carbazoles from 2-(Benzotriazol-1-ylmethyl)indole|first1=Alan R. |last1=Katritzky |first2=Jianqing |last2=Li |first3=Christian V. |last3=Stevens |journal = J.

===Oxidation of indole===
Due to the electron-rich nature of indole, it is easily [[redox|oxidized]]. Simple oxidants such as [[N-Bromosuccinimide|''N''-bromosuccinimide]] will selectively oxidize indole '''1''' to [[oxindole]] ('''4''' and '''5''').

:[[File:Indole NBS Oxidation.png|600px|Oxidation of indole by ''N''-bromosuccinimide]]

===Cycloadditions of indole===

Only the C2–C3 [[pi bond]] of indole is capable of [[cycloaddition reaction]]s. Intramolecular variants are often higher-yielding than intermolecular cycloadditions. For example, Padwa ''et al.''<ref name="lynch2002">{{cite journal|last1=Lynch |first1=S. M. |last2=Bur |first2=S. K. |last3=Padwa |first3=A. |journal = [[Org. Lett.]]|doi = 10.1021/ol027024q|pmid = 12489950|title = Intramolecular Amidofuran Cycloadditions across an Indole π-Bond: An Efficient Approach to the ''Aspidosperma'' and ''Strychnos'' ''ABCE'' Core|year = 2002|volume = 4|issue = 26|pages = 4643–5}}</ref> have developed this [[Diels-Alder reaction]] to form advanced [[strychnine]] intermediates. In this case, the 2-aminofuran is the [[diene]], whereas the indole is the [[dienophile]]. Indoles also undergo intramolecular [2+3] and [2+2] cycloadditions.

==Applications==
Natural [[jasmine]] [[Essential oil|oil]], used in the [[perfume]] industry, contains around 2.5% of indole. Since 1 kilogram of the natural oil requires processing several million [[jasmine]] blossoms and costs around US$10,000, indole (among other things) is used in the manufacture of synthetic jasmine oil, costing about US$10 per kilogram.
