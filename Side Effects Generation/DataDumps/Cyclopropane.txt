'''Cyclopropane''' is a [[cycloalkane]] [[molecule]] with the molecular formula C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, consisting of three [[carbon]] [[atoms]] linked to each other to form a ring, with each carbon atom bearing two [[hydrogen]] atoms resulting in D<sub>3h</sub> [[molecular symmetry]]. The small size of the ring creates substantial [[ring strain]] in the structure.

Cyclopropane is an [[anaesthetic]] when inhaled.  In modern anaesthetic practice, it has been superseded by other agents. Due to its extreme reactivity, cyclopropane-oxygen mixtures may explode.

==History==
Cyclopropane was discovered in 1881 by [[August Freund]], who also proposed the correct structure for the new substance in his first paper.<ref name=Freund81>{{Cite journal | title = Über Trimethylen | trans_title = On trimethylene | author = August Freund | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | year = 1881 | doi = 10.1002/prac.18820260125 | journal = Journal für Praktische Chemie | pages = 367–377 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WSzzAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA367#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> Freund treated [[1,3-Dibromopropane|1,3-dibromopropane]] with [[sodium]], causing an intramolecular [[Wurtz reaction]] leading directly to cyclopropane.<ref name=Freund82>{{cite journal | title = Über Trimethylen | trans_title = On trimethylene | author = August Freund | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | year = 1882 | doi = 10.1007/BF01516828 | journal = Monatshefte für Chemie … | pages = 625–635 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=b448AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA625#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> The yield of the reaction was improved by Gustavson in 1887 with the use of [[zinc]] instead of sodium.<ref name=Gustavson>{{cite journal

==Anaesthesia==
Cyclopropane was introduced into clinical use by the American anaesthetist [[Ralph M. Waters|Ralph Waters]] who used a closed system with carbon dioxide absorption to conserve this then-costly agent.
Cyclopropane is a relatively potent, non-irritating and sweet smelling agent with a [[minimum alveolar concentration]] of 17.5%<ref>{{cite journal|last=Eger|first=Edmond I.|author2=Brandstater, Bernard |author3=Saidman, Lawrence J. |author4=Regan, Michael J. |author5=Severinghaus, John W. |author6= Munson, Edwin S. |title=Equipotent Alveolar Concentrations of Methoxyflurane, Halothane, Diethyl Ether, Fluroxene, Cyclopropane, Xenon and Nitrous Oxide in the Dog|journal=Anesthesiology|year=1965|volume=26|issue=6|pages=771–777|doi=10.1097/00000542-196511000-00012}}</ref> and a [[Blood:gas partition coefficient|blood/gas partition coefficient]] of 0.55. This meant induction of anaesthesia by inhalation of cyclopropane and oxygen was rapid and not unpleasant. However at the conclusion of prolonged anaesthesia patients could suffer a sudden decrease in blood pressure, potentially leading to [[cardiac dysrhythmia]]; a reaction known as "cyclopropane shock".<ref>{{cite journal|last=JOHNSTONE|first=M|author2=Alberts, JR|title=Cyclopropane anesthesia and ventricular arrhythmias.|journal=British heart journal|date=July 1950|volume=12|issue=3|pages=239–44|pmid=15426685|doi=10.1136/hrt.12.3.239|pmc=479392}}</ref> For this reason, as well as its high cost and its explosive nature,<ref>{{cite journal|last=MacDonald|first=AG|title=A short history of fires and explosions caused by anaesthetic agents.|journal=British journal of anaesthesia|date=June 1994|volume=72|issue=6|pages=710–22|pmid=8024925|doi=10.1093/bja/72.6.710}}</ref> it was latterly used only for the induction of anaesthesia, and has not been available for clinical use since the mid 1980s.

===Pharmacology===
Cyclopropane is inactive at the [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub>]] and [[glycine receptor]]s, and instead acts as an [[NMDA receptor antagonist]].<ref name="HemmingsHopkins2006">{{cite book|author1=Hugh C.

==Structure and bonding==
{{further|Bent bond}}
[[File:Coulson Moffit Model.png|150px|thumb|left|Orbital overlap in the bent bonding model of cyclopropane]]
The triangular structure of cyclopropane requires the [[bond angle]]s  between carbon-carbon bonds to be 60°. This is far less than the thermodynamically most stable angle of 109.5° (for bonds between atoms with sp<sup>3</sup> [[Orbital hybridisation|hybridised orbitals]]) and leads to significant ring strain. The molecule also has torsional strain due to the [[eclipsed conformation]] of its hydrogen atoms. As such, the bonds between the carbon atoms are considerably weaker than in a typical [[alkane]], resulting in much higher reactivity.

Bonding between the carbon centres is generally described in terms of [[bent bond]]s.<ref>Eric V. Anslyn and Dennis A. Dougherty. ''Modern Physical Organic Chemistry.'' 2006. pages 850-852</ref> In this model the carbon-carbon bonds are bent outwards so that the inter-orbital angle is 104°.  This reduces the level of bond strain and is achieved by distorting the sp<sup>3</sup> hybridisation of carbon atoms to technically sp<sup>5</sup> hybridisation<ref>http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic93502.files/Lectures_and_Handouts/06-Handouts/deMeijere.pdf</ref><sup>,</sup><ref>http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1032290.files/lecture%203.pdf</ref> (i.e. {{frac|1|6}} s density and {{frac|5|6}} p density) so that the C-C bonds have more π character than normal<ref>{{cite book|last=Knipe|first=edited by A.C.|title=March's advanced organic chemistry reactions, mechanisms, and structure.|year=2007|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=0470084944|page=219|edition=6th}}</ref> (at the same time the carbon-to-hydrogen bonds gain more s-character). One unusual consequence of bent bonding is that while the C-C bonds in cyclopropane are weaker than normal, the carbon atoms are also closer together than in a regular alkane bond: 151 [[picometer|pm]] versus 153 pm (average [[alkene]] bond: 146 pm).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Frank H.|author2=Kennard, Olga |author3=Watson, David G. |author4=Brammer, Lee |author5=Orpen, A. Guy |author6= Taylor, Robin |title=Tables of bond lengths determined by X-ray and neutron diffraction. Part 1. Bond lengths in organic compounds|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society, Perkin Transactions 2|year=1987|issue=12|pages=S1-S19|doi=10.1039/P298700000S1|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/1987/p2/p298700000s1}}</ref>

Stability due to cyclic delocalization of the six electrons of cyclopropane's three CC σ bonds was given by [[Michael J. S. Dewar]] as an explanation of the only slightly greater strain of cyclopropane ("only" 27.6&nbsp;kcal/mol) as compared to cyclobutane (26.2&nbsp;kcal/mol) with cyclohexane as reference with E<sub>str</sub>=0&nbsp;kcal/mol.<ref>S. W. Benson, Thermochemical Kinetics, S. 273, J. Wiley & Sons, New York, London, Sydney, Toronto 1976</ref> This stabilization is referred to as σ aromaticity,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dewar | first1 = M. J. | year = 1984 | title = Chemical Implications of σ Conjugation | url = | journal = J. Am. Chem. Soc. | volume = 106 | issue = | pages = 669–682 | doi=10.1021/ja00315a036}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cremer | first1 = D. | year = 1988 | title = Pros and Cons of σ-Aromaticity | doi = 10.1016/s0040-4020(01)86238-4 | journal = Tetrahedron | volume = 44 | issue = 2| pages = 7427–7454 }}</ref> in contrast to the usual π aromaticity, that, for example, is a highly stabilizing effect in [[benzene]]. Other studies do not support the role of σ-aromaticity in cyclopropane and the existence of an induced ring current; such studies provide an alternative explanation for the energetic stabilization and abnormal magnetic behaviour of cyclopropane.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wu | first1 = Wei | last2 = Ma | first2 = Ben | last3 = Wu | first3 = Judy I-Chia | last4 = von Ragué | first4 = Schleyer |last5 = Mo | first5 = Yirong | year = 2009 | title = Is Cyclopropane Really the σ-Aromatic Paradigm? | url = | journal = Chemistry: A European Journal | volume = 15 | issue = 38| pages = 9730–9736 | doi = 10.1002/chem.200900586 }}</ref>

==Synthesis==
Cyclopropane was first produced via a [[Wurtz coupling]], in which  [[1,3-dibromopropane]] was [[cyclisation|cyclised]] using sodium.<ref name=Freund81/> The yield of this reaction can be improved by exchanging the metal for [[zinc]].<ref name=Gustavson/>

===Cyclopropanation===
Cyclopropane rings are found in numerous [[biomolecule]]s (e.g., [[pyrethrin]]s, a group of natural insecticides) and [[pharmaceutical drug]]s. As such the formation of cyclopropane rings, generally referred to as [[cyclopropanation]], is an active area of chemical research.

==Reactions==
Owing to the increased π-character of its C-C bonds, cyclopropane can react like an alkene in certain cases. For instance it undergoes [[hydrohalogenation]] with [[mineral acid]]s to give linear alkyl halides. Substituted cyclopropanes also react, following [[Markovnikov's rule]].<ref>Advanced organic Chemistry, Reactions, mechanisms and structure 3ed. Jerry March {{ISBN|0-471-85472-7}}</ref> Substituted cyclopropanes can [[Oxidative Addition|oxidatively add]] to [[transition metals]], in a process referred to as [[Cyclopropane carbon-carbon bond activation|C–C activation]].

==Safety==
Cyclopropane is highly flammable. However, despite its strain energy it is not substantially more explosive than [[Flammability limit#Examples|other alkanes]].
