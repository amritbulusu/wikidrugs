'''Amfonelic acid''' ('''AFA'''; '''WIN 25,978''') is a [[research chemical]] and [[dopaminergic]] [[stimulant]] with [[antibiotic]] properties.<ref name=Hamilton>{{cite web|url=http://harpers.org/archive/2015/10/sad-pink-monkey-blues/ |title=Sad Pink Monkey Blues |last=Morris, Hamilton |publisher=Harper's Magazine |date=October 2015 |accessdate=2015-09-19}}</ref>

==History==
The stimulant properties of AFA were discovered serendipitously at [[Sterling Drug|Sterling-Winthrop]] in the midst of research on the antibiotic [[nalidixic acid]].<ref name="Hamilton"/> In addition to behaving as antibiotics, it was found that many derivatives of nalidixic acid have either stimulant or depressant effects on the [[central nervous system]].<ref>{{ cite patent | country = US | status = patent | number = 3590036 | title = Naphthyridine-3-carboxylic Acids, Their Derivatives and Preparation Thereof }}</ref> Researchers at Sterling-Winthrop found that AFA had a higher potency and [[therapeutic index]] than [[cocaine]] or [[amphetamine]] and so it was singled out for further study.<ref name="Hamilton"/><ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=4393073|year=1970|last1=Aceto|first1=M.A.|title=Pharmacologic properties and mechanism of action of amfonelic acid|pages=344–354|journal=European Journal of Pharmacology|doi=10.1016/0014-2999(70)90206-2|volume=10}}</ref> A small number of clinical trials were held in the 1970s, but when it was found that AFA exacerbated psychotic symptoms in schizophrenic patients and produced undesirable stimulant properties in geriatric depressives clinical evaluation of AFA was discontinued.<ref name="Hamilton"/> AFA remains a widely used pharmacological tool for study of the brain's [[reward system]], [[dopamine pathways]], and the [[dopamine transporter]].<ref name=Hamilton /> Since 2013 AFA has been sold on the [[gray market]] and there are numerous anecdotal reports detailing its [[Recreational drug use|non-medical use]].<ref name=Hamilton />

Though AFA was discovered in the course of antibiotic research, there is very little data available on the drug's antimicrobial activity. In 1988 the biologist G.C. Crumplin wrote, "[AFA] is less active against bacteria than are many other 4-quinolones, but studies in our laboratory on selected mammalian cell lines have shown it to be markedly more toxic to these cells than are the 4-quinolones that are more active antibacterial agents. Furthermore, it can be shown that sublethal doses induced marked changes in the pattern of proteins produced by the cell, thus suggesting a possible effect of 4-quinolones on gene transcription in mammalian cells."<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=3279494|year=1988|last1=Crumplin|first1=G.C.|title=Aspects of Chemistry in the Development of the 4-Quinolone Antibacterial Agents |issue=10|pages=S2-S9|journal=Reviews of Infectious Diseases|doi=10.1093/clinids/10.Supplement_1.S2|volume=10 Suppl 1}}</ref> When evaluated via [[broth microdilution]] the [[Minimum inhibitory concentration|MIC]] of AFA for [[Escherichia coli]] is 125 μg/mL, a concentration thirty times higher than the MIC for nalidixic acid in the same E. coli strain.<ref name=Hamilton />
