A ''' shire''' is a traditional term for a division of land, found in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]] and some other English speaking countries. It was first used in [[Wessex]] from the beginning of [[Anglo-Saxon]] settlement, and spread to most of the rest of [[England]] in the tenth century. In some rural parts of Australia, a shire is a local government area; however, in Australia it is not synonymous with a "county", which is a [[Lands administrative divisions of Australia|lands administrative division]].

==Etymology==
The word derives from the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''scir'', itself a derivative of the Proto-Germanic ''skizo'' (cf. Old High German ''scira''), meaning care or official charge.<ref>Online Etymology Dictionary, entry "Shire". Retrieved 15 October 2011.</ref> In the UK, "shire" is the original term for what is usually known now as a ''[[county]]''; the word ''county'' having been introduced at the [[Norman Conquest]] of England. The two are nearly synonymous.  Although in modern British usage counties are referred to as "shires" mainly in poetic contexts, terms such as [[Shire Hall]] remain common. Shire also remains a common part of many county names. 

In regions with so-called [[Rhoticity in English|rhotic]] pronunciation such as [[Scotland]], the word ''shire'' is pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|aɪ|r}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|aɪər}}. In non-rhotic areas the final R is silent unless the next word begins in a vowel. When ''shire'' is a suffix as part of a placename in [[England]], the vowel is unstressed and thus usually shortened and/or monophthongised: pronunciations include  {{IPAc-en|ʃ|ɜ}}, or sometimes {{IPAc-en|ʃ|ɪə}}, with the pronunciation of the final R again depending on rhoticity. In many words, the vowel is normally reduced all the way to a single [[schwa]], as in for instance ''[[Leicestershire]]'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɛ|s|t|ə|ʃ|ə}} or ''[[Berkshire]]'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɑː|k|ʃ|ə}}. Outside England, and especially in Scotland and the US, it is more common for ''shire'' as part of a placename to be pronounced identically to the full word, as a result of [[spelling pronunciation]].

==Origins==
The system was first used in [[Wessex]] from the beginning of [[Anglo-Saxon]] settlement, and spread to most of the rest of England in the tenth century, along with West Saxon political control. In [[Domesday]] (1086) the city of [[York]] was divided into [[shires]].<ref>Gareth Dean, ''Medieval York'' 2008:21.</ref> The first shires of Scotland were created in English-settled areas such as [[Lothian]] and the [[Scottish Borders|Borders]], in the ninth century. [[David I of Scotland|King David I]] more consistently created shires and appointed [[sheriff]]s across lowland ''shores'' of Scotland.

The shire in early days was governed by an ''[[Ealdorman]]'' and in the later Anglo-Saxon period by royal official known as a "shire [[Reeve (England)|reeve]]" or [[Sheriff#Term|sheriff]]. The shires were divided into [[hundred (county subdivision)|hundreds]] or [[hundred (country subdivision)#Other terms|wapentakes]], although other less common sub-divisions existed.  An alternative name for a shire was a "sheriffdom" until [[sheriff court]] reforms separated the two concepts. The phrase "shire county" applies, unofficially, to [[non-metropolitan county|non-metropolitan counties]] in England, specifically those that are not local [[Unitary authority]] areas. In Scotland the word "county" was not adopted for the shires.  Although "county" appears in some texts, "shire" was the normal name until counties for statutory purposes were created in the nineteenth century.

== Shires in the United Kingdom ==

"Shire" also refers, in a narrower sense, to ancient counties with names that ended in "shire". These counties are typically (though not always) named after their [[county town]]. The suffix ''-shire'' is attached to most of the names of English, Scottish and Welsh counties.  It tends not to be found in the names of shires that were pre-existing divisions. [[Essex]], [[Kent]], and [[Sussex]], for example, have never borne a ''-shire'', as each represents a former [[Heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon kingdom]].  Similarly [[Cornwall]] was a [[Britons (historical)|British]] kingdom before it became an English county. The term 'shire' is not used in the names of the [[Counties of Northern Ireland|six traditional counties]] of [[Northern Ireland]].

===Shire names in England===
Shires in England bearing the "-shire" suffix include:
[[Bedfordshire]], [[Berkshire]], [[Buckinghamshire]], [[Cambridgeshire]], [[Cheshire]], [[Derbyshire]], [[Gloucestershire]], [[Hampshire]], [[Herefordshire]], [[Hertfordshire]], [[Huntingdonshire]], [[Lancashire]], [[Lincolnshire]], [[Leicestershire]], [[Northamptonshire]], [[Nottinghamshire]], [[Oxfordshire]], [[Shropshire]], [[Staffordshire]], [[Warwickshire]], [[Wiltshire]], [[Worcestershire]], and [[Yorkshire]]. These counties, on their [[Historic counties of England|historical boundaries]], cover a little more than half the area of England. The counties that do not use "-shire" are mainly in three areas, in the south-east, south-west and far north of England.

The areas of [[South Gloucestershire]] and [[North Somerset]] are [[Unitary authorities]], and only have '-shire' in their name because these former [[County of Avon]] areas existed - in the past - as part of the neighbouring '-shire' County.

Yorkshire [[History of local government in Yorkshire|no longer exists]] as a unit of local government in England. Some of the successor modern counties formed by its breakup ([[North Yorkshire]], [[South Yorkshire]] and [[West Yorkshire]]) however retain the old county name as a component. ([[East Riding of Yorkshire|East Yorkshire]] has a more complicated signification{{which|date=June 2017}}.)

The county of [[Devon]] is also known as Devonshire, and although this is not currently the official name it was historically the County's name.<ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~genmaps/genfiles/COU_files/ENG/DEV/bill_dev_1626.html</ref>  The counties of [[Dorset]], [[Rutland]] and [[Somerset]] were likewise formerly Dorsetshire, Rutlandshire and Somersetshire. These terms are now most commonly restricted in use to the local populations, and are not local government / geographic areas.

[[Hexhamshire]] was a county in the north-east of England from the early 12th century until 1572, when it was incorporated into [[Northumberland]].

===Shire names in Scotland===
In Scotland, barely affected by the [[Norman conquest of England]], the word "shire" prevailed over "county" until the 19th century. Earliest sources have the same usage of the "-shire" suffix as in England (though in Scots this was oftenmost "schyr").  Later the "Shire" appears as a separate word.

"Shire" names in Scotland include [[Aberdeenshire (traditional)|Aberdeenshire]], [[Ayrshire]], [[Banffshire]], [[Berwickshire]], [[Clackmannanshire]], [[Cromartyshire]], [[Dumfriesshire]], [[Dunbartonshire]], [[Inverness-shire]], [[Kincardineshire]], [[Kinross-shire]], [[Kirkcudbrightshire]], [[Lanarkshire]], [[Morayshire]], [[Nairnshire]], [[Peeblesshire]], [[Perthshire]], [[Renfrewshire]], [[Ross-shire]], [[Roxburghshire]], [[Selkirkshire]], [[Stirlingshire]], and [[Wigtownshire]]. 	

In Scotland four shires have alternative names with the "-shire" suffix: [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]] (Forfarshire), [[East Lothian]] (Haddingtonshire), [[Midlothian]] (Edinburghshire) and [[West Lothian]] (Linlithgowshire).

[[Sutherland]] is occasionally still referred to as Sutherlandshire. Similarly, [[Argyllshire]], [[Buteshire]], [[Caithness-shire]] and [[Fifeshire]] are sometimes found. Also, Morayshire was previously called Elginshire. There is currently much debate about whether Argyllshire was ever really used.

===Shire names in Wales===
Shires in [[Wales]] bearing the "-shire" suffix include: [[Brecknockshire]] (or Breconshire), [[Caernarfonshire]], [[Ceredigion|Cardiganshire]], [[Carmarthenshire]], [[Denbighshire (historic)|Denbighshire]], [[Flintshire (historic)|Flintshire]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]], [[Montgomeryshire]], [[Pembrokeshire]], and [[Radnorshire]]. In Wales, the counties of [[Merioneth]] and [[Glamorgan]] are occasionally referred to with the "shire" suffix. The only traditional Welsh county that never takes "shire" is [[Isle of Anglesey|Anglesey]]—in English: in Welsh it is referred to as 'Sir Fon'.

===Non-county "shires"===
The suffix &ndash;''shire'' could be a generalised term referring to a district. It did not acquire the strong association with [[county]] until later. Other than these, the term was used for several other districts. [[Bedlingtonshire]], [[Craikshire]], [[Norhamshire]] and [[Islandshire]] were [[exclave]]s of County Durham, which were incorporated into Northumberland or [[Yorkshire]] in 1844. The suffix was also used for many [[hundred (division)|hundred]]s, [[wapentake]]s and liberties such as [[Allertonshire]], [[Blackburnshire]], [[Halfshire]], [[Howdenshire]], [[Leylandshire]], [[Powdershire]], [[Pydarshire]], [[Richmondshire]], [[Liberty of Ripon|Riponshire]], [[Salfordshire]], [[Triggshire]], [[Tynemouthshire]], [[West Derby (hundred)|West Derbyshire]] and [[Wivelshire]], [[county corporate|counties corporate]] such as [[Hullshire]], and other districts such as [[Applebyshire]], [[Bamburghshire]], [[Bunkleshire]], [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisleshire,]] [[Coldinghamshire]], [[Coxwoldshire]], [[Cravenshire]], [[Hallamshire]], [[Mashamshire]] and [[Yetholmshire]]. [[Richmondshire]] is today the name of a [[Districts of England|local government district]] of [[North Yorkshire]].

Non-county shires were very common in Scotland. [[Kinross-shire]] and [[Clackmannanshire]] are arguably survivals from such districts. Non-county "shires" in Scotland include [[Bunkleshire]], [[Coldinghamshire]] and [[Yetholmshire]].

==Shires in Australia==
"Shire" is the most common word in [[Australia]] for rural [[Local government in Australia|local government areas (LGAs)]]. [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Queensland]], [[Western Australia]] and the [[Northern Territory]] use the term "Shire" for this unit; the territories of [[Shire of Christmas Island|Christmas Island]] and [[Shire of Cocos|Cocos Island]] are also shires. In contrast, [[South Australia]] uses [[district]] and [[region]] for its rural LGA units, while [[Tasmania]] uses [[municipality]]. Shires are generally functionally indistinguishable from [[town]]s, [[borough]], [[municipality|municipalities]], or [[city|cities]].

Three LGAs in outer metropolitan [[Sydney]] and four in outer metropolitan [[Melbourne]] have populations exceeding that of towns or municipalities, but retain significant bushlands and/or semi-rural areas, and most have continued to use "Shire" in their titles whilst others have dropped "Shire" from their titles. These "city-shires" are:

Sydney:
* [[Sutherland Shire]] (which is locally referred to as "The Shire")
* [[The Hills Shire]] ("The Garden Shire", previously "Baulkham Hills Shire")
* [[Hornsby Shire]] ("The Bushland Shire")

Melbourne:
* [[Shire of Nillumbik]] ("The Green Wedge Shire")
* [[Shire of Yarra Ranges]]
* [[Shire of Cardinia]]
* [[Shire of Mornington Peninsula]] (which is locally known as "The Peninsula")
* [[Shire of Pakenham]]

==Shires in the United States==
In 1634, eight "shires" were created in the [[Virginia Colony]] by order of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], King of England. They were renamed as [[County (United States)|counties]] only a few years later. They were:

* [[Accomac Shire]] (since 1642 [[Northampton County, Virginia]])
* [[Charles City Shire]] (since 1637 [[Charles City County, Virginia]])
* [[Charles River Shire]] (now [[York County, Virginia]])
* [[Elizabeth City Shire]] (now consolidated with the City of [[Hampton, Virginia]])
* [[Henrico Shire]] (now [[Henrico County, Virginia]])
* [[James City Shire]] (about 1642-43 [[James City County, Virginia]])
* [[Warwick River Shire]]  (now consolidated with the City of [[Newport News, Virginia]])
* [[Warrosquyoake Shire]] (now [[Isle of Wight County, Virginia]])

As of 2013 six of the original eight [[Shires of Virginia]] are considered to be still extant whilst two have consolidated with a neighbouring city. Most of their boundaries have changed in the intervening centuries.

Before the [[Province of New York]] was granted county subdivisions and a greater royal presence in 1683, the early ducal colony consisted of [[Yorkshire County, New York|York Shire]], as well as [[Albany County, New York|Albany]] and [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster]], after the three titles held by [[James II of England|Prince James]]: [[Duke of York]], [[Duke of Albany]], [[Earl of Ulster]].  While these were basically renamed Dutch core settlements, they were quickly converted to English purposes, while the Dutch remained within the colony, as opposed to later practice of the [[Acadian Expulsion]].  Further Anglo-Dutch synthesis occurred when James enacted the [[Dominion of New England]] and later when [[William III of England]] took over through the [[Glorious Revolution]].

A few [[New England]] states and commonwealths (namely [[Vermont]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[Maine]]), still use the term ''shire town'' for their [[county seat]]s, although they use the term county, rather than shire.

The word also survives in the name of the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[New Hampshire]], whose co-founder, [[John Mason (governor)|John Mason]], named his [[Province of New Hampshire]] after the [[Hampshire|English county]].
