'''Lumiracoxib''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|rINN]]) is a [[carboxylic acid]] [[COX-2 selective inhibitor]] [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]], manufactured by [[Novartis]] and still sold in few countries, including [[Mexico]], [[Ecuador]] and the [[Dominican Republic]], under the trade name '''Prexige''' (sometimes misquoted as "Prestige" by the media).<ref name = EurJ>{{cite journal|last=Shi|first=S|author2=Klotz, U |title=Clinical use and pharmacological properties of selective COX-2 inhibitors.|journal=European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology|date=March 2008|volume=64|issue=3|pages=233–52|doi=10.1007/s00228-007-0400-7|pmid=17999057}}</ref>

Lumiracoxib has several distinctive features. Its structure is different from that of other COX-2 inhibitors, such as [[celecoxib]]: lumiracoxib is an [[analog (chemistry)|analogue]] of [[diclofenac]] (one chlorine substituted by fluorine, the phenylacetic acid has another methyl group in meta position), making it a member of the arylalkanoic acid class of NSAIDs; it binds to a different site on the COX-2 enzyme than do other COX-2 inhibitors; it is the only [[acid]]ic coxib and has the highest COX-2 selectivity of any NSAID.<ref name=Tacconelli>{{cite journal |vauthors=Tacconelli S, Capone ML, Patrignani P |title=Clinical pharmacology of novel selective COX-2 inhibitors |journal=Curr Pharm Des |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=589–601 |year=2004 |pmid=14965322 |doi= 10.2174/1381612043453108|url=https://zenodo.org/record/977695}}</ref>

Since its original approval, lumiracoxib has been [[list of withdrawn drugs|withdrawn from the market]] in several countries, mostly due to its potential for causing liver failure (sometimes requiring [[liver transplantation]]). It has never been approved for use in the United States.<ref name = EurJ/>

==History==
The TARGET study ('''T'''herapeutic '''A'''rthritis '''R'''esearch and '''G'''astrointestinal '''E'''vent '''T'''rial) was conducted with more than 18,000 patients to test its gastrointestinal and cardiovascular safety against [[naproxen]] and [[ibuprofen]] and also study its efficacy against these two NSAIDs.

In November 2006, Prexige received marketing approval for all European Union countries through a common procedure called MRP. However, in August 2007, Prexige was withdrawn from the market in Australia following 8 serious liver adverse events, including 2 deaths and 2 liver transplants.<ref>[http://www.tga.gov.au/recalls/2007/lumiracoxib.htm Urgent medicine recall - Lumiracoxib (PREXIGE)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On September 27, 2007, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a not approvable letter for lumiracoxib, requiring additional safety data.<ref>http://hugin.info/134323/R/1156327/223186.pdf</ref>  Canada withdrew Prexige (approved at 100&nbsp;mg dose only) in October 2007.<ref>[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/advisories-avis/_2007/2007_141-eng.php Withdrawal of Market Authorization for Prexige<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Several European Union countries followed suit in November 2007.<ref>[http://www.novartis.com/newsroom/media-releases/en/2007/1169462.shtml Media releases<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The FDA rejected '''Prexige''' as a trade name for lumiracoxib in 2003.  '''Prexede''' was suggested as an alternative, but the FDA Division of Medication Errors and Technical Support (DMETS) subsequently recommended against it as well.<ref>http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/05/briefing/2005-4090B1_33_GG-FDA-Tab-U.pdf</ref>

===Withdrawal from market===
On August 11, 2007, Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration ([[Therapeutic Goods Administration|TGA]], the national agency responsible for regulation of pharmaceuticals) cancelled the registration of lumiracoxib in Australia due to concerns that it may cause liver failure.<ref>[http://www.tga.gov.au/media/2007/070811-lumiracoxib.htm Medicines Regulator cancels registration of anti inflammatory drug, Lumiracoxib], ''[[Therapeutic Goods Administration]]'', 11 August 2007. Retrieved on 2007-08-11</ref>

According to the TGA's Principal Medical Adviser, Dr Rohan Hammett, as of 10 August 2007 the TGA had received 8 reports of serious adverse liver reactions to the drug, including two deaths and two liver transplants.

<blockquote>
"The TGA and its expert advisory committee, the Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee (ADRAC), have urgently investigated these reports. ADRAC has today recommended the cancellation of the registration of Lumiracoxib due to the severity of the reported side effects associated with this drug," Dr Hammett said.

"The TGA has taken this advice to cancel the registration of Lumiracoxib in order to prevent further cases of severe liver damage.

"It seems that the longer people are on the medicine, the greater the chance of liver injury. The TGA is, therefore, advising people to stop taking the Lumiracoxib immediately and to discuss alternative treatments with their doctor," Dr Hammett said.<ref>http://www.tga.gov.au/media/2007/070811-lumiracoxib.htm</ref>

New Zealand has followed suit with Australia in recalling Prexige.<ref name="NZ_Herald_10459030">{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/category/story.cfm?c_id=278&objectid=10459030 |title=NZ regulators ban arthritis drug |date=21 August 2007 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=12 September 2011}}</ref>

On October 3, 2007, Health Canada requested sales of Prexige to stop. Novartis has agreed to the request and has taken steps to do so.<ref>http://www.novartis.ca/downloads/en/letters/prexige_fact_20071003_e.pdf</ref> On December 13, 2007, the European Medicines Agency recommended the withdrawal for Prexige from all EU markets.<ref>[http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/press/pr/PR_Lumiracoxib_57930107en.pdf Press release: European Medicines Agency recommends withdrawal of the marketing authorisations for lumiracoxib-containing medicines, 13 December 2007]</ref>

On January 17, 2008, the [[Philippines]] [[Department of Health]] ordered [[Novartis]] Healthcare Phils. Inc. (Novartis) to remove (recall) all lumiracoxib from local drug stores in 2 weeks due to the harmful effects of the drug (potential serious [[liver]]-related side effects, hepatotoxicity or malfunction of the [[lung]]s).<ref>[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=105842  Abs-Cbn Interactive, DOH recalls lumiracoxib, sets two-week deadline]</ref>

On November 12, 2008, INVIMA, the [[Colombia]]n National Institute for Food and Drug Surveillance ordered the withdrawal of all presentations of lumiracoxib (Prexige), due to the international reports on hepatotoxicity.
