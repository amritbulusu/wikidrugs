===Pain===
Paracetamol is used for the relief of mild to moderate pain. The use of the intravenous form for pain of sudden onset in people in the emergency department is supported by limited evidence.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sin|first1=B|last2=Wai|first2=M|last3=Tatunchak|first3=T|last4=Motov|first4=SM|title=The use of intravenous acetaminophen for acute pain in the emergency department.|journal=Academic Emergency Medicine|date=29 January 2016|pmid=26824905|doi=10.1111/acem.12921|volume=23|pages=543–53}}</ref>

====Osteoarthritis====
The [[American College of Rheumatology]] recommends paracetamol as one of several treatment options for people with arthritis pain of the hip, hand, or knee that does not improve with exercise and weight loss.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hochberg MC, Altman RD, April KT, etal |title=American College of Rheumatology 2012 recommendations for the use of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies in osteoarthritis of the hand, hip, and knee |journal=Arthritis Care Res (Hoboken) |volume=64 |issue=4 |pages=465–74 | date=April 2012 |pmid=22563589 |doi= 10.1002/acr.21596|url=}}</ref> A 2015 review, however, found it provided only a small benefit in osteoarthritis.<ref name=BMJ2015>{{cite journal|last1=Machado|first1=GC|last2=Maher|first2=CG|last3=Ferreira|first3=PH|last4=Pinheiro|first4=MB|last5=Lin|first5=CW|last6=Day|first6=RO|last7=McLachlan|first7=AJ|last8=Ferreira|first8=ML|title=Efficacy and safety of paracetamol for spinal pain and osteoarthritis: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised placebo controlled trials.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=31 March 2015|volume=350|pages=h1225|pmid=25828856|doi=10.1136/bmj.h1225|pmc=4381278}}</ref>

Paracetamol has relatively little anti-inflammatory activity, unlike other common analgesics such as the [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAID]]s aspirin and ibuprofen, but ibuprofen and paracetamol have similar effects in the treatment of headache. Paracetamol can relieve pain in mild arthritis, but has no effect on the underlying inflammation, redness, and swelling of the joint.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arthritisresearchuk.org/arthritis-information/drugs/painkillers/paracetamol.aspx |title=Paracetamol |publisher=[[Arthritis Research UK]] |accessdate=October 16, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017001230/http://www.arthritisresearchuk.org/arthritis-information/drugs/painkillers/paracetamol.aspx |archivedate=October 17, 2013 |df= }}</ref> It has [[analgesic]] properties comparable to those of [[aspirin]], while its anti-inflammatory effects are weaker. It is better tolerated than aspirin due to concerns about bleeding with aspirin.

====Low back pain====
Based on a systematic review, paracetamol is recommended by the [[American College of Physicians]] and the [[American Pain Society]] as a first-line treatment for low back pain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guideline.gov/expert/expert-commentary.aspx?id=16452&search=acetaminophen+ |title=National Guideline Clearinghouse &#124; Expert Commentaries: Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Back Pain: A Joint Clinical Practice Guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society.

====Headaches====
A joint statement of the German, Austrian, and Swiss headache societies and the German Society of Neurology recommends the use of paracetamol in combination with caffeine as one of several first line therapies for treatment of tension or [[migraine]] headache.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Haag G, Diener HC, May A, etal |title=Self-medication of migraine and tension-type headache: summary of the evidence-based recommendations of the Deutsche Migräne und Kopfschmerzgesellschaft (DMKG), the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Neurologie (DGN), the Österreichische Kopfschmerzgesellschaft (ÖKSG) and the Schweizerische Kopfwehgesellschaft (SKG) |journal=J Headache Pain |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=201–17 | date=April 2011 |pmid=21181425 |pmc=3075399 |doi=10.1007/s10194-010-0266-4 |url=}}</ref> In the treatment of acute migraine, it is superior to placebo, with 39% of people experiencing pain relief at one hour compared with 20% in the control group.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Derry S, Moore RA |title=Paracetamol (acetaminophen) with or without an antiemetic for acute migraine headaches in adults |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=4 |issue= |pages=CD008040 |year=2013 |pmid=23633349 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008040.pub3 |url=}}</ref>

====Postoperative pain====
Paracetamol combined with NSAIDs may be more effective for treating postoperative pain than either paracetamol alone or NSAIDs alone.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ong|first1=CK|last2=Seymour|first2=RA|last3=Lirk|first3=P|last4=Merry|first4=AF|title=Combining paracetamol (acetaminophen) with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs: a qualitative systematic review of analgesic efficacy for acute postoperative pain.|journal=Anesthesia and Analgesia|date=1 April 2010|volume=110|issue=4|pages=1170–9|doi=10.1213/ANE.0b013e3181cf9281|pmid=20142348}}</ref>

===Skin reactions===
On August 2, 2013, the [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) issued a new warning about paracetamol.

Untreated overdose can lead to [[liver failure]] and death within days. Treatment is aimed at removing the paracetamol from the body and replenishing [[glutathione]].<ref name="met1"/> [[Activated charcoal]] can be used to decrease absorption of paracetamol if the person comes to the hospital soon after the overdose. While the antidote, [[acetylcysteine]] (also called N-acetylcysteine or NAC), acts as a precursor for glutathione, helping the body regenerate enough to prevent or at least decrease the possible damage to the liver, a [[liver transplant]] is often required if damage to the liver becomes severe.<ref name="DalyMJA" /><ref name="urlAcetadote Prescribing Information">{{cite web|url=http://acetadote.com/Acetadote21-539-12_PI_Clean_June2013.pdf |title=Highlights of Prescribing Information |work= |publisher=Acetadote |language= |quote= |accessdate=2014-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222012224/http://acetadote.com/Acetadote21-539-12_PI_Clean_June2013.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}</ref> NAC was usually given following a treatment [[nomogram]] (one for people with risk factors, and one for those without) but the use of the nomogram is no longer recommended as evidence to support the use of risk factors was poor and inconsistent, and many of the risk factors are imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certainty in clinical practice.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Paracetamol overdose: new guidance on treatment with intravenous acetylcysteine |journal=Drug Safety Update |date=September 2012 |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=A1 |url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Safetyinformation/DrugSafetyUpdate/CON185624 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027163355/http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Safetyinformation/DrugSafetyUpdate/CON185624 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-10-27 |df= }}</ref> NAC also helps in neutralizing the imidoquinone metabolite of paracetamol.<ref name="met1"/> [[Kidney failure]] is also a possible side effect.

Until 2004, tablets were available (brand-name in the UK Paradote) that combined paracetamol with an antidote ([[methionine]]) to protect the liver in case of an overdose. One theoretical, but rarely if ever used, option in the United States is to request a [[compounding pharmacy]] to make a similar drug mix for people who are at risk.

In June 2009, a [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) advisory committee recommended that new restrictions be placed on paracetamol usage in the United States to help protect people from the potential toxic effects. The maximum dosage at any given time would be decreased from 1000&nbsp;mg to 650&nbsp;mg, while combinations of paracetamol and [[opioid]] [[analgesic]]s would be prohibited. Committee members were particularly concerned by the fact that the then present maximum dosages of paracetamol had been shown to produce alterations in [[liver|hepatic]] function.<ref name="WebMD">{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/pain-management/news/20090701/fda-may-restrict-acetaminophen |title=FDA May Restrict Acetaminophen |publisher=Webmd |date=2009-07-01 |accessdate=2011-03-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321075108/http://www.webmd.com/pain-management/news/20090701/fda-may-restrict-acetaminophen |archivedate=2011-03-21 |df= }}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
[[Image:AM404 skel.svg|thumb|[[AM404]]&nbsp;– [[Metabolite]] of paracetamol]]
[[Image:Anandamide skeletal.svg|thumb|[[Anandamide]]&nbsp;– Endogenous [[cannabinoid]]]]

The mechanism of action of paracetamol is not completely understood.  Unlike [[NSAID]]s such as [[aspirin]], paracetamol does not appear to inhibit the function of any [[cyclooxygenase]] (COX) enzyme outside the [[central nervous system]], and this appears to be the reason why it is not useful as an [[anti-inflammatory]].<ref name=Ghanem2016>{{cite journal|last1=Ghanem|first1=CI|last2=Pérez|first2=MJ|last3=Manautou|first3=JE|last4=Mottino|first4=AD|title=Acetaminophen from liver to brain: New insights into drug pharmacological action and toxicity.|journal=Pharmacological research|date=July 2016|volume=109|pages=119–31|doi=10.1016/j.phrs.2016.02.020|pmid=26921661|pmc=4912877}}</ref>  It does appear to selectively inhibit [[COX]] activities in the brain, which may contribute to its ability to treat fever and pain.<ref name=Ghanem2016/>  This activity does not appear to be direct inhibition by blocking an active site, but rather by [[Redox#Reducers|reducing]] COX, which must be oxidized in order to function.<ref name=Ghanem2016/>

It also appears that paracetamol might modulate the [[Endocannabinoid system|endogenous cannabinoid system]] in the brain through paracetamol's metabolite, [[AM404]].  AM404 appears to inhibit the reuptake of the endogenous cannabinoid/vanilloid [[anandamide]] by neurons, making it more available to reduce pain.  AM404 also appears to be able to directly activate the [[TRPV1]] (older name: vanilloid receptor), which also inhibits pain signals in the brain.<ref name=Ghanem2016/>

==Pharmacokinetics==
[[Image:Paracetamol metabolism.svg|thumb|Main pathways of paracetamol metabolism ''(click to enlarge)''. Pathways shown in blue and purple lead to non-toxic metabolites; the pathway in red leads to toxic [[NAPQI]].]]

*''N''-hydroxylation and dehydration, then glutathione conjugation, (less than 15%).

===Chemical properties===
[[Image:Polar-surface-area.png|thumb|Paracetamol molecule [[polar surface area]]]]
[[Image:Paracetamol Electron Map.png|thumb|Paracetamol electrostatic potential map]]

Paracetamol consists of a [[benzene]] ring core, [[substituent|substituted]] by one [[hydroxyl]] group and the [[nitrogen]] atom of an [[amide]] group in the ''para'' (1,4) [[Arene substitution patterns|pattern]].<ref name="Bales">{{cite journal|last=Bales|first=JR|author2=Nicholson JK|author3=Sadler PJ|title=Two-dimensional proton nuclear magnetic resonance "maps" of acetaminophen metabolites in human urine|journal=Clinical Chemistry|volume=31|issue=5|pages=757–762|url=http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/reprint/31/5/757|pmid=3987005|year=1985|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121202118/http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/reprint/31/5/757|archivedate=2008-11-21|df=}}</ref> The amide group is [[acetamide]] (ethanamide). It is an extensively [[conjugated system]], as the [[lone pair]] on the hydroxyl oxygen, the benzene pi cloud, the nitrogen lone pair, the [[atomic orbital|p orbital]] on the [[carbonyl]] carbon, and the lone pair on the carbonyl oxygen are all conjugated. The presence of two activating groups also make the benzene ring highly reactive toward [[electrophile|electrophilic]] aromatic substitution. As the substituents are ''ortho, para''-directing and ''para'' with respect to each other, all positions on the ring are more or less equally activated. The conjugation also greatly reduces the [[base (chemistry)|basicity]] of the oxygens and the nitrogen, while making the hydroxyl acidic through delocalisation of charge developed on the [[phenol|phenoxide]] [[ion|anion]].

===Synthesis===

====Original (Boots) method====
The original method for production involves the [[nitration]] of [[phenol]] with [[sodium nitrate]] gives a mixture of two isomers, from which the wanted [[4-nitrophenol]] (bp 279&nbsp;°C) can easily be separated by [[steam distillation]]. In this [[electrophilic aromatic substitution]] reaction, phenol's oxygen is strongly activating, thus the reaction requires only mild conditions as compared to nitration of benzene itself. The [[nitro group]] is then reduced to an amine, giving [[4-aminophenol]]. Finally, the amine is acetylated with [[acetic anhydride]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Ellis, Frank |title=Paracetamol: a curriculum resource |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry |location=Cambridge |year=2002 |isbn=0-85404-375-6}}</ref> Industrially direct hydrogenation is used, but in the laboratory scale sodium borohydride serves.<ref>{{cite book|author = Anthony S.

After cooling the acetic acid was evaporated and the precipitate was filtered, washed with water and dried to give paracetamol as a white solid.
The authors go on to claim an 88% yield and 99% purity.

In September 2013, an episode of ''[[This American Life]]'' entitled "Use Only as Directed"<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Use Only as Directed |url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/505/use-only-as-directed |accessdate=24 September 2013 |series=This American Life |serieslink=This American Life |network=[[Public Radio International]] |station=[[WBEZ]] |location=Chicago |date=20 September 2013 |number=505 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927121525/http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/505/use-only-as-directed |archivedate=27 September 2013 |df= }}</ref> highlighted deaths from paracetamol overdose.

So has the maker of Tylenol, McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a division of Johnson & Johnson" and "McNeil, the maker of Tylenol, ... has repeatedly opposed safety warnings, dosage restrictions and other measures meant to safeguard users of the drug."

A report prepared by an internal FDA working group describes a history of FDA initiatives designed to educate consumers about the risk of paracetamol overdose and notes that one challenge to the Agency has been "identifying the appropriate message about the relative safety of acetaminophen, especially compared to other OTC pain relievers (e.g., aspirin and other NSAIDs)". The report notes that "Chronic use of NSAIDs is also associated with significant morbidity and mortality. NSAID gastrointestinal risk is substantial, with deaths and hospitalization estimated in one publication as 3200 and 32,000 per year respectively. Possible cardiovascular toxicity with chronic NSAID use has been a major discussion recently", finally noting that "The goal of the educational efforts is not to decrease appropriate acetaminophen use or encourage substitution of NSAID use, but rather to educate consumers so that they can avoid unnecessary health risks."<ref name="www.fda.gov">{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/DrugSafetyandRiskManagementAdvisoryCommittee/UCM164898.pdf |title=Recommendations for FDA Interventions to Decrease the Occurrence of Acetaminophen Hepatotoxicity |work= |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924160711/http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/DrugSafetyandRiskManagementAdvisoryCommittee/UCM164898.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}</ref>

==Veterinary use==

===Cats===
Paracetamol is extremely toxic to cats, which lack the necessary [[glucuronyl transferase]] enzymes to break it down safely. Initial symptoms include vomiting, salivation, and discoloration of the tongue and gums.

Unlike an overdose in humans, liver damage is rarely the cause of death; instead, [[methemoglobin]] formation and the production of [[Heinz bodies]] in red blood cells inhibit oxygen transport by the blood, causing [[asphyxiation]] ([[methemoglobemia]] and [[hemolytic anemia]]).<ref name="CanVetJ2003-Allen">{{cite journal|author=Allen AL|title=The diagnosis of acetaminophen toxicosis in a cat|journal=Can Vet J|year=2003|pages=509–10|volume=44|issue=6|pmid=12839249|pmc=340185}}</ref>

Treatment with [[N-acetylcysteine]],<ref name="doi10.1111/j.1476-4431.2000.tb00013.x" /> [[methylene blue]] or both is sometimes effective after the ingestion of small doses of paracetamol.

===Dogs===
Although paracetamol is believed to have no significant anti-inflammatory activity, it has been reported as effective as aspirin in the treatment of musculoskeletal pain in dogs.<ref name=smallani>{{cite book|title=Small Animal Clinical Pharmacology|first=Jill E.|last=Maddison|author2=Stephen W.
