'''5,6-Methylenedioxy-''N''-methyl-2-aminoindane''' ('''MDMAI'''), is a [[drug]] developed in the 1990s by a team led by [[David E. Nichols]] at [[Purdue University]]. It acts as a non-[[neurotoxic]] and highly [[binding selectivity|selective]] [[selective serotonin releasing agent|serotonin releasing agent]] (SSRA) in animals and a putative [[empathogen-entactogen|entactogen]] in humans.<ref name="pmid1979813">{{cite journal | vauthors = Oberlender R, Nichols DE | title = (+)-N-methyl-1-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-2-butanamine as a discriminative stimulus in studies of 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine-like behavioral activity| journal = J Pharmacol Exp Ther. | volume = 255 | issue = 3 | pages = 1098â€“1106 | year = 1990 | pmid = 1979813 }}</ref>

== Chemistry ==
MDMAI can be thought of as a cyclised [[analog (chemistry)|analogue]] of [[MDMA]] where the alpha-methyl carbon of the alkylamino side chain has been joined back round to the 6-position of the aromatic ring to form an [[indane]] ring system. This changes the core structure of the molecule from [[phenethylamine]] to [[aminoindane]], and causes the pharmacological properties of the two compounds to be substantially different.<ref name="pmid1979813" />
