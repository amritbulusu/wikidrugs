'''5-(2-Aminopropyl)-2,3-dihydro-1''H''-indene''' ('''5-APDI'''), also known as '''indanylaminopropane''' ('''IAP'''), IAP (psychedelic), 2-API(2-aminopropylindane), indanametamine, and, incorrectly, as '''indanylamphetamine''',<ref name="journalCharacterization of the “Indanylamphetamines”">{{cite journal | vauthors = Casale JF, McKibben TD, Bozenko JS, Hays PA | title = Characterization of the "Indanylamphetamines" | journal = Microgram Journal | volume = 3 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 3–10 | year = 2005 | url = http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/programs/forensicsci/microgram/journal_v3/mj05_v3_pg1.html}}</ref> is an [[entactogen]] and [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] [[drug]] of the [[substituted amphetamine|amphetamine]] family.<ref name="pmid8246240">{{cite journal | vauthors = Monte AP, Marona-Lewicka D, Cozzi NV, Nichols DE | title = Synthesis and pharmacological examination of benzofuran, indan, and tetralin analogues of 3,4-(methylenedioxy)amphetamine | journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 36 | issue = 23 | pages = 3700–6 |date=November 1993 | pmid = 8246240 | doi = 10.1021/jm00075a027| url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid9526575">{{cite journal | vauthors = Parker MA, Marona-Lewicka D, Kurrasch D, Shulgin AT, Nichols DE | title = Synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of ring-methylated derivatives of 3,4-(methylenedioxy)amphetamine (MDA) | journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 41 | issue = 6 | pages = 1001–5 |date=March 1998 | pmid = 9526575 | doi = 10.1021/jm9705925}}</ref> It has been sold by [[online shopping|online vendors]] through the [[Internet]] and has been encountered as a [[designer drug]] since 2003,<ref name="journalCharacterization of the “Indanylamphetamines”"/> but its popularity and availability has diminished in recent years.

5-APDI acts as a [[potency (pharmacology)|potent]] and weakly [[binding selectivity|selective]] [[serotonin releasing agent]] (SSRA) with [[IC50|IC<sub>50</sub>]] values of 82 nM, 1,848 nM, and 849 nM for inhibiting the [[reuptake]] of [[serotonin]], [[dopamine]], and [[norepinephrine]], respectively.<ref name="pmid8246240"/><ref name="pmid9526575"/> It fully substitutes for [[MBDB]] but not [[amphetamine]] in trained animals, though it does produce disruption for the latter at high doses.<ref name="pmid8246240"/>

5-APDI has been classified as a class B drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 since 10 June 2014.
