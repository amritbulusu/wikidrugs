Only a few studies attempted to compare the pharmacokinetic profile of various esters; one investigation compared the profiles of estradiol benzoate, valerate and unducelate although at relatively high doses corresponding to the equivalent of 20 mg of estradiol (6). [...] The present data also indicate that the three estradiol esters never yielded elevated estradiol levels beyond 15 days following the administration of doses used therapeutically. These findings are in contrast with those reported by others (6) following the injection of large quantities (exceeding 20 mg) of estradiol valerate and benzoate. This seeming discrepancy underlines the importance of the dosage to be selected for pharmacokinetic investigations, which must be close to that intended for clinical (contraceptive) use.}}</ref>

Estradiol undecylate is a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]] [[estrane]] (C18) [[steroid]] and the C17β [[undecylic acid|undecylate]] (or undecanoate) [[fatty acid]] [[ester]] of [[estradiol]].<ref name="Roberts1991" /><ref name="IndexNominum2000" /> It is also known as '''estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17β-diol 17β-undecanoate'''.<ref name="Roberts1991" /><ref name="IndexNominum2000" /> A few related estradiol esters include [[estradiol decanoate]], [[estradiol diundecylate]], and [[estradiol diundecylenate]].

Estradiol undecylate is a relatively long-chain ester of estradiol. Its ester chain contains 11 [[carbon]] [[atom]]s. For comparison, the ester chains of [[estradiol acetate]], [[estradiol valerate]], and [[estradiol enanthate]] have 2, 5, and 7 carbon atoms, respectively.

Estradiol undecylate was developed, along with [[estradiol valerate]], in 1954.<ref name="pmid13142295">{{cite journal | author = WIED GL | title = [Estradiol valerate and estradiol undecylate, two new estrogens with prolonged action; comparison with estradiol benzoate] | journal = Geburtshilfe Und Frauenheilkunde | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–52 |date=January 1954 | pmid = 13142295 | doi = | url = }}</ref>
