'''Cyromazine''' is a [[triazine]] insect growth regulator used as an [[insecticide]] and an [[acaricide]].  It is a [[cyclopropyl]] derivative of [[melamine]].  Cyromazine works by affecting the nervous system of the immature larval stages of certain insects.<ref>[http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/insect-mite/cadusafos-cyromazine/cyromazine/insect-prof-cyromazine.html Pesticide Fact Sheet] from Pesticide Management Education Program, [[Cornell University]]</ref>

In veterinary medicine, cyromazine is used as an [[ectoparasiticide]].{{fact|date=February 2014}}

==Regulation==
The [[Food Safety and Inspection Service]] (FSIS) of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) provides a test method for analyzing cyromazine and [[melamine]] in animal tissues in its Chemistry Laboratory Guidebook which "contains test methods used by FSIS Laboratories to support the Agency's inspection program, ensuring that meat, poultry, and egg products are safe, wholesome and accurately labeled."<ref name=FSIScyro>{{cite web
