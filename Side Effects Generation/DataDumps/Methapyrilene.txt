'''Methapyrilene''' is an [[antihistamine]] and [[anticholinergic]] of the [[pyridine]] [[chemical class]] which was developed in the early 1950s. It was sold under the trade names Co-Pyronil and Histadyl EC.<ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Archive.-a0119048413 The Birmingham Post Archive]. thefreelibrary.com</ref> It has relatively strong [[sedative]] effects, to the extent that its primary use was as a medication for [[insomnia]] rather than for its antihistamine action. Together with [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]], it was the main ingredient in '''Sominex''', '''Nytol''', and '''Sleep-Eze'''. It also provided the sedative component of '''Excedrin PM'''. All of these products were reformulated in the late 1970s when methapyrilene was demonstrated to cause [[liver cancer]] in rats when given chronically.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lijinsky|first1=W|last2=Reuber|first2=M.|last3=Blackwell|first3=B.|title=Liver tumors induced in rats by oral administration of the antihistaminic methapyrilene hydrochloride|journal=Science|volume=209|issue=4458|year=1980|pages=817â€“819|pmid=7403848|doi=10.1126/science.7403848}}</ref>
