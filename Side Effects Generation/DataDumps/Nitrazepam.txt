==Medical use==
Nitrazepam is used to treat short-term sleeping problems ([[insomnia]]),<ref name="Tanaka-2008">{{cite journal |vauthors=Tanaka M, Suemaru K, Watanabe S, Cui R, Li B, Araki H | title = Comparison of short- and long-acting benzodiazepine-receptor agonists with different receptor selectivity on motor coordination and muscle relaxation following thiopental-induced anesthesia in mice. | journal = J Pharmacol Sci | volume = 107 | issue = 3 | pages = 277–84 | date = Jul 2008 | pmid = 18603831 | doi = 10.1254/jphs.FP0071991 | url = http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jphs/107/3/277/_pdf | format = PDF }}</ref> namely difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakening, early awakening, or a combination of each.

Nitrazepam is sometimes tried to treat epilepsy when other medications fail. It has been found to be more effective than [[clonazepam]] in the treatment of [[West syndrome]], which is an age-dependent epilepsy, affecting the very young. In uncontrolled studies, nitrazepam has shown effectiveness in infantile spasms and is sometimes considered when other anti-seizure drugs have failed.<ref name="Tsao-2009"/> However, [[hypotonia|drowsiness, hypotonia]], and most significantly [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]] to anti-seizure effects typically develop with long term treatment, generally limiting Nitrazepam to acute seizure management.<ref>{{cite journal|date=December 1998|title=Benzodiazepines in the treatment of epilepsy in people with intellectual disability|journal=J Intellect Disabil Res|volume=42|issue=1|pages=80–92|pmid=10030438|vauthors=Isojärvi JI, Tokola RA}}</ref>

==Side effects==

===More common side effects===
More common side effects may include: [[Central nervous system]] depression, including [[somnolence]], [[dizziness]], depressed mood, rage, violence, [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[ataxia]], [[headache]], [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], impairment of memory, impairment of motor functions, hangover feeling in the morning, slurred speech, decreased physical performance, numbed emotions, reduced alertness, muscle weakness, double vision, and inattention have been reported. Unpleasant dreams and rebound insomnia have also been reported.

Nitrazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine with an [[elimination half-life]] of 15–38 hours (mean elimination half-life 26 hours).[http://www.non-benzodiazepines.org.uk/equivalents.html] Residual "hangover" effects after nighttime administration of nitrazepam such as sleepiness, impaired psychomotor and [[cognitive]] functions may persist into the next day, which may impair the ability of users to drive safely and increases the risk of falls and [[hip fractures]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Vermeeren A | title = Residual effects of hypnotics: epidemiology and clinical implications | journal = CNS Drugs | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 297–328 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15089115 | doi = 10.2165/00023210-200418050-00003 }}</ref>

===Less common side effects===
Less common side effects may include: [[Hypotension]],<ref name="nithypotension">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hossmann V, Maling TJ, Hamilton CA, Reid JL, Dollery CT | title = Sedative and cardiovascular effects of clonidine and nitrazepam | journal = Clin Pharmacol Ther | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 167–76 | date = August 1980 | pmid = 7398184 | doi = 10.1038/clpt.1980.146 }}</ref> faintness, [[palpitation]], rash or [[pruritus]], gastrointestinal disturbances, and changes in [[libido]] are less common. Very infrequently, [[paradoxical reaction]]s may occur, for example, excitement, stimulation, hallucinations, hyperactivity, and insomnia.

==Tolerance dependence and withdrawal==

===Tolerance===
Tolerance to nitrazepam's effects occurs with regular use. Increased levels of [[GABA]] in [[Cerebrum|cerebral]] tissue and alterations in the activity state of the serotoninergic system occur as a result of nitrazepam tolerance.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

[[Drug tolerance|Tolerance]] to the sleep-inducing effects of nitrazepam occurs after about seven days;{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} tolerance also frequently occurs to its anticonvulsant effects.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

====Dependence and withdrawal====
{{See also|Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome}}
Nitrazepam can cause dependence, addiction, and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal from nitrazepam may lead to withdrawal symptoms which are similar to those seen with [[ethanol|alcohol]] and [[barbiturates]]. Common withdrawal symptoms include [[anxiety]], [[insomnia]], concentration problems, and [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]].<ref name="Străulea-">{{cite journal |vauthors=Străulea AO, Chiriţă V | title = [The withdrawal syndrome in benzodiazepine dependence and its management] | journal = Rev Med Chir Soc Med Nat Iasi | volume = 113 | issue = 3 | pages = 879–84 | date = July–September 2009 | pmid = 20191849 }}</ref> Discontinuation of nitrazepam produced rebound insomnia after short-term single nightly dose therapy.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kales A, Scharf MB, Kales JD, Soldatos CR | title = Rebound insomnia.

===Elderly===
Nitrazepam, similar to other benzodiazepines and [[nonbenzodiazepines]], causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. Combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments.<ref name="Mets-2010">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mets MA, Volkerts ER, Olivier B, Verster JC | title = Effect of hypnotic drugs on body balance and standing steadiness | journal = Sleep Med Rev | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 259–67 | date = Feb 2010 | pmid = 20171127 | doi = 10.1016/j.smrv.2009.10.008 }}</ref> Nitrazepam has been found to be dangerous in elderly patients due to a significantly increased risk of falls.<ref name="Shats-1995">{{cite journal |vauthors=Shats V, Kozacov S | title = [Falls in the geriatric department: responsibility of the care-giver and the hospital] | journal = Harefuah | volume = 128 | issue = 11 | pages = 690–3 | date = June 1, 1995 | pmid = 7557666 }}</ref> This increased risk is probably due to the drug effects of nitrazepam persisting well into the next day.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Borland RG, Nicholson AN | title = Comparison of the residual effects of two benzodiazepines (nitrazepam and flurazepam hydrochloride) and pentobarbitone sodium on human performance | journal = Br J Clin Pharmacol | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–17 | date = February 1975 | pmid = 10941 | pmc = 1402497 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2125.1975.tb00465.x }}</ref> Nitrazepam is a particularly unsuitable hypnotic for the [[elderly]] as it induces a disability characterised by general mental deterioration, inability to walk, [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]], dysarthric, [[confusion]], [[stumbling]], [[falling (accident)|falls]], and disoriention which can occur from doses as low as 5&nbsp;mg. The nitrazepam-induced symptomatology can lead to a misdiagnosis of brain disease in the elderly, for example [[dementia]], and can also lead to the symptoms of [[postural hypotension]] which may also be misdiagnosed. A [[geriatric]] unit reportedly was seeing as many as seven patients a month with nitrazepam-induced disabilities and health problems.

===Children===
Nitrazepam is not recommended for use in those under 18 years of age. Use in very young children may be especially dangerous. Children treated with nitrazepam for epilepsies may develop tolerance within months of continued use, with dose escalation often occurring with prolonged use. Sleepiness, deterioration in motor skills and [[ataxia]] were common side effects in children with [[tuberous sclerosis]] treated with nitrazepam. The side effects of nitrazepam may impair the development of motor and cognitive skills in children treated with nitrazepam. Withdrawal only occasionally resulted in a return of seizures and some children withdrawn from nitrazepam appeared to improve. Development, for example the ability to walk at five years of age, was impaired in many children taking nitrazepam, but was not impaired with several other nonbenzodiazepine [[antiepileptic]] agents. Children being treated with nitrazepam have been recommended to be reviewed and have their nitrazepam gradually discontinued whenever appropriate.<ref name="Dennis-1985">{{cite journal |vauthors=Dennis J, Hunt A | title = Prolonged use of nitrazepam for epilepsy in children with tuberous sclerosis | journal = Br Med J (Clin Res Ed) | volume = 291 | issue = 6497 | pages = 692–3 | date = September 14, 1985 | pmid = 3929902 | pmc = 1416679 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.291.6497.692 }}</ref> Excess sedation, [[hypersalivation]], swallowing difficulty, and high incidence of [[aspiration pneumonia]], as well as several deaths, have been associated with nitrazepam therapy in children.<ref name="Tsao-2009">{{cite journal | author = Tsao CY | title = Current trends in the treatment of infantile spasms | journal = Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat | volume = 5 | pages = 289–99 | date = May 20, 2009 | pmid = 19557123 | pmc = 2695218 | doi = 10.2147/ndt.s4488 | format = PDF }}</ref>

===Pregnancy===

Nitrazepam is not recommended during pregnancy as it is associated with causing a [[neonatal withdrawal syndrome]]<ref name="McElhatton-"/> and is not generally recommended in alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals or people with comorbid psychiatric disorders.<ref name="Authier-2009"/> The Dutch, British and French system called the System of Objectified Judgement Analysis for assessing whether drugs should be included in drug formularies based on clinical efficacy, [[adverse effects]], [[pharmacokinetic]] properties, [[toxicity]], and [[drug interactions]] was used to assess nitrazepam. A Dutch analysis using the system found nitrazepam to be unsuitable in drug-prescribing formularies.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Janknegt R, van der Kuy A, Declerck G, Idzikowski C | title = Hypnotics. Drug selection by means of the System of Objectified Judgement Analysis (SOJA) method | journal = PharmacoEconomics | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 152–63 | date = August 1996 | pmid = 10163418 | doi = 10.2165/00019053-199610020-00007 | url =  }}</ref>

The use of nitrazepam during pregnancy can lead to intoxication of the newborn. A neonatal withdrawal syndrome can also occur if nitrazepam or other benzodiazepines are used during pregnancy with symptoms such as hyperexcitability, tremor, and gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea or vomiting) occurring. [[Breast feeding]] by mothers using nitrazepam is not recommended.<ref name="Serreau-2010">{{cite journal | author = Serreau R | title = [Drugs during preeclampsia.

Accumulation can occur in various body organs, including the heart; accumulation is even greater in babies. Nitrazepam rapidly crosses the placenta and is present in breast milk in high quantities. Therefore, benzodiazepines including nitrazepam should be avoided during pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Olive G, Dreux C | title = Pharmacologic bases of use of benzodiazepines in peréinatal medicine | journal = Arch Fr Pediatr | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 74–89 | date = January 1977 | pmid = 851373 }}</ref> In early pregnancy, nitrazepam levels are lower in the baby than in the mother, and in the later stages of pregnancy, nitrazepam is found in equal levels in both the mother and the unborn child.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kangas L, Kanto J, Erkkola R | title = Transfer of nitrazepam across the human placenta | journal = Eur J Clin Pharmacol | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 355–7 | date = December 16, 1977 | pmid = 598407 | doi = 10.1007/BF00562451 }}</ref> Internationally benzodiazepines are known to cause harm when used during pregnancy and nitrazepam is a category D drug during pregnancy.

===Other precautions===
'''Caution in hypotension'''

Caution in those suffering from [[hypotension]], nitrazepam may worsen hypotension.<ref name="nithypotension"/>

'''Caution in hypothyroidism'''

Caution should be exercised by people who have [[hypothyroidism]], as this condition may cause a long delay in the metabolism of nitrazepam leading to significant drug accumulation.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kenny RA, Kafetz K, Cox M, Timmers J, Impallomeni M | title = Impaired nitrazepam metabolism in hypothyroidism | journal = Postgrad Med J | volume = 60 | issue = 702 | pages = 296–7 | date = April 1984 | pmid = 6728755 | pmc = 2417841 | doi = 10.1136/pgmj.60.702.296 }}</ref>

==Contraindications==
Nitrazepam should be avoided in patients with [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), especially during acute exacerbations of COPD, because serious respiratory depression may occur in patients receiving hypnotics.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Midgren B, Hansson L, Ahlmann S, Elmqvist D | title = Effects of single doses of propiomazine, a phenothiazine hypnotic, on sleep and oxygenation in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease | journal = Respiration | volume = 57 | issue = 4 | pages = 239–42 | year = 1990 | pmid = 1982774 | doi = 10.1159/000195848 }}</ref>

Initially, [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|FDA]] reviewers did not want to approve the Z-drugs due to concerns of cancer, but ultimately changed their minds and approved the drugs despite the concerns. The data show the trial subjects receiving hypnotic drugs had an increased risk of developing cancer.

====Mortality====
Nitrazepam therapy, compared with other drug therapies, increases risk of death when used for intractable epilepsy in an analysis of 302 patients. The risk of death from nitrazepam therapy may be greater in younger patients (children below 3.4 years in the study) with intractable epilepsy. In older children (above 3.4 years), the tendency appears to be reversed in this study.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rintahaka PJ, Nakagawa JA, Shewmon DA, Kyyronen P, Shields WD | title = Incidence of death in patients with intractable epilepsy during nitrazepam treatment | journal = Epilepsia | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 492–6 | date = April 1999 | pmid = 10219277 | doi = 10.1111/j.1528-1157.1999.tb00746.x }}</ref> Nitrazepam may cause sudden death in children. It can cause swallowing incoordination, high-peaked [[esophagus|esophageal]] [[peristalsis]], [[bronchospasm]], delayed cricopharyngeal relaxation, and severe [[Labored breathing|respiratory distress]] necessitating ventilatory support in children. Nitrazepam may promote the development of [[parasympathetic]] overactivity or [[vagotonia]], leading to potentially fatal respiratory distress in children.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lim HC, Nigro MA, Beierwaltes P, Tolia V, Wishnow R | title = Nitrazepam-induced cricopharyngeal dysphagia, abnormal esophageal peristalsis and associated bronchospasm: probable cause of nitrazepam-related sudden death | journal = Brain & development | volume = 14 | issue = 5 | pages = 309–14 | date = September 1992 | pmid = 1456385 | doi = 10.1016/s0387-7604(12)80149-5 }}</ref>

====Liver====
Nitrazepam has been associated with severe hepatic disorders, similar to other nitrobenzodiazepines. Nitrobenzodiazepines such as nitrazepam, [[nimetazepam]], [[flunitrazepam]], and [[clonazepam]] are more toxic to the liver than other benzodiazepines as they are metabolically activated by [[CYP3A4]] which can result in [[cytotoxicity]]. This activation can lead to the generation of [[free radicals]] and oxidation of thiol, as well as covalent binding with endogenous macromolecules; this results, then, in oxidation of cellular components or inhibition of normal cellular function. Metabolism of a nontoxic drug to reactive metabolites has been causally connected with a variety of adverse reactions.<ref name="Mizuno-2009">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mizuno K, Katoh M, Okumura H, Nakagawa N, Negishi T, Hashizume T, Nakajima M, Yokoi T | title = Metabolic activation of benzodiazepines by CYP3A4 | journal = Drug Metab Dispos | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 345–51 | date = Feb 2009 | pmid = 19005028 | doi = 10.1124/dmd.108.024521 | url = http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/content/37/2/345.full.pdf+html | format = PDF }}</ref>

Severe nitrazepam overdose resulting in coma causes the central somatosensory conduction time (CCT) after median nerve stimulation to be prolonged and the N20 to be dispersed. Brain-stem auditory evoked potentials demonstrate delayed interpeak latencies (IPLs) I-III, III-V and I-V. Toxic overdoses therefore of nitrazepam cause prolonged CCT and IPLs. An alpha pattern coma can be a feature of nitrazepam overdose with alpha patterns being most prominent in the frontal and central regions of the brain.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Carroll WM, Mastiglia FL | title = Alpha and beta coma in drug intoxication | journal = Br Med J | volume = 2 | issue = 6101 | pages = 1518–9 | date = December 1977 | pmid = 589310 | pmc = 1632784 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.2.6101.1518-a }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rumpl E, Prugger M, Battista HJ, Badry F, Gerstenbrand F, Dienstl F | title = Short latency somatosensory evoked potentials and brain-stem auditory evoked potentials in coma due to CNS depressant drug poisoning.

Benzodiazepines were implicated in 39% of suicides by drug poisoning in [[Sweden]], with nitrazepam and [[flunitrazepam]] accounting for 90% of benzodiazepine implicated suicides, in the elderly over a period of 2 decades. In three quarters of cases death was due to drowning, typically in the bath. Benzodiazepines were the predominant drug class in suicides in this review of Swedish [[death certificates]]. In 72% of the cases benzodiazepines were the only drug consumed. Benzodiazepines and in particular nitrazepam and flunitrazepam should therefore be prescribed with caution in the elderly.<ref name="Carlsten-2003">{{cite journal |vauthors=Carlsten A, Waern M, Holmgren P, Allebeck P | title = The role of benzodiazepines in elderly suicides | journal = Scand J Public Health | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 224–8 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12850977 | doi = 10.1080/14034940210167966 }}</ref> In a brain sample of a fatal nitrazepam poisoning high concentrations of nitrazepam and its metabolite were found in the brain of the deceased person.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Moriya F, Hashimoto Y | title = Tissue distribution of nitrazepam and 7-aminonitrazepam in a case of nitrazepam intoxication | journal = Forensic Sci Int | volume = 131 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 108–12 | date = January 28, 2003 | pmid = 12590048 | doi = 10.1016/S0379-0738(02)00421-8 }}</ref>

In a retrospective study of deaths, when benzodiazepines were implicated in the deaths, the benzodiazepines nitrazepam and [[flunitrazepam]] were the most common benzodiazepines involved. Benzodiazepines were a factor in all deaths related to drug addiction in this study of causes of deaths. Nitrazepam and [[flunitrazepam]] were significantly more commonly implicated in suicide related deaths than natural deaths. In four of the cases benzodiazepines alone were the only cause of death.<ref name="Ericsson-1993">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ericsson HR, Holmgren P, Jakobsson SW, Lafolie P, De Rees B | title = [Benzodiazepine findings in autopsy material.

Individuals with chronic illnesses are much more vulnerable to lethal overdose with nitrazepam, as fatal overdoses can occur at relatively low doses in these individuals.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Brødsgaard I, Hansen AC, Vesterby A | title = Two cases of lethal nitrazepam poisoning | journal = Am J Forensic Med Pathol | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 151–3 | date = June 1995 | pmid = 7572872 | doi = 10.1097/00000433-199506000-00015 }}</ref>

==Synthesis==
Reaction of 2-amino-5-nitrobenzophenone ('''1''') with [[bromoacetyl bromide]] forms the amide '''2'''. Ring closure in [[liquid ammonia]] affords nitrazepam ('''3'''). More simply, [[diazepinone]] ('''4''') can be nitrated directly at the more reactive C<sub>7</sub> position with [[potassium nitrate]] in [[sulfuric acid]].
