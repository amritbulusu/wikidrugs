==Uses==
Permethrin is used:
* as an insecticide
** in agriculture, to protect crops (lethal for bees)
** in agriculture, to kill livestock parasites
** for industrial/domestic insect control
** in the textile industry to prevent insect attack of woollen products
** in aviation, the [[WHO]], [[International Health Regulations|IHR]] and [[ICAO]] require arriving aircraft be disinsected prior to departure, descent or deplaning in certain countries
** to treat head lice in humans
* as an insect repellent or insect screen
** in timber treatment
** as a personal protective measure (cloth impregnant, used primarily for US military uniforms and mosquito nets)
** in pet flea preventative collars or treatment
* often in combination with [[piperonyl butoxide]] to enhance its effectiveness.

===Medical use ===
Permethrin is available for topical use as a cream or lotion. It is indicated for the treatment and prevention in exposed individuals of [[head lice]] and treatment of [[scabies]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Permethrin (Lexi-Drugs)|url=http://www.lexi.com/|work=Lexicomp Online|publisher=Wolters Kluwer|access-date=19 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417164854/http://www.lexi.com/|archivedate=17 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

For treatment of scabies: Adults and children older than 2 months are instructed to apply the cream to the entire body from head to the soles of the feet. Wash off the cream after 8–14 hours. In general, one treatment is curative.<ref>{{cite web|title=Permethrin Patient Package Insert|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/anda/98/074806ap.pdf|publisher=FDA|access-date=19 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420043409/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/anda/98/074806ap.pdf|archivedate=20 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

For treatment of head lice: Apply to hair, scalp, and neck after shampooing. Leave in for 10 minutes and rinse. Avoid contact with eyes.<ref name="Package Label">{{cite web|title=Package Label|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/anda/2000/75014_Permethrin_Prntlbl.pdf|publisher=Alpharma, USPD, Inc. Baltimore|access-date=19 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420031625/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/anda/2000/75014_Permethrin_Prntlbl.pdf|archivedate=20 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== Pest control ===
In agriculture, permethrin is mainly used on [[cotton]], [[wheat]], [[maize]], and [[alfalfa]] crops. Its use is controversial because, as a [[broad-spectrum]] chemical, it kills indiscriminately; as well as the intended pests, it can harm beneficial insects, including [[honey bee]]s, and aquatic life.<ref>{{cite journal | author = R. H. Ian | title = Aquatic organisms and pyrethroids | year = 1989 | journal = [[Pesticide Science]] | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 429–457 | doi = 10.1002/ps.2780270408}}</ref>

Permethrin kills ticks and mosquitoes  on contact with treated clothing. A method of reducing deer tick populations by treating rodent vectors involves stuffing biodegradable cardboard tubes with permethrin-treated cotton. Mice collect the cotton for lining their nests. Permethrin on the cotton instantly kills any immature ticks feeding on the mice.

Permethrin is used in tropical areas to prevent [[mosquito]]-borne disease such as [[dengue fever]] and [[malaria]]. [[Mosquito nets]] used to cover beds may be treated with a solution of permethrin. This increases the effectiveness of the bed net by killing parasitic insects before they are able to find gaps or holes in the net. Military personnel training in malaria-endemic areas may be instructed to treat their uniforms with permethrin, as well.

Permethrin is the most commonly used insecticide worldwide for the protection of wool from keratinophagous insects such as ''Tineola bisselliella''.<ref>{{cite journal | author1 = Ingham P. E. | author2 = McNeil S. J. | author3 = Sunderland M.

== Side effects ==
Permethrin application can cause mild skin irritation and burning. Discontinue use if hypersensitivity occurs.

=== Safety ===
Permethrin has little systemic absorption, and is considered safe for topical use in adults and children over the age of 2 months. The FDA has assigned it as pregnancy category B. Animal studies have shown no effects on fertility or [[Teratology|teratogenicity]], but studies in humans have not been performed. The excretion of permethrin in breastmilk is unknown, and breastfeeding is recommended to be temporarily discontinued during treatment.<ref name="Package Label" />

According to the Connecticut Department of Public Health, permethrin "has low mammalian toxicity, is poorly absorbed through the skin, and is rapidly inactivated by the body. Skin reactions have been uncommon."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dph.state.ct.us/BCH/infectiousdise/tickborne/tick.htm#Permethrin | title = Tick Bite Prevention | author = Kirby C. Stafford III | date = February 1999 | publisher = Connecticut Department of Public Health | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050912070432/http://www.dph.state.ct.us/BCH/infectiousdise/tickborne/tick.htm#Permethrin | archivedate = 12 September 2005 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

Excessive exposure to permethrin can cause [[nausea]], headache, muscle weakness, excessive [[salivation]], shortness of breath, and [[seizure]]s. Worker exposure to the chemical can be monitored by measurement of the [[urinary]] [[metabolite]]s, while severe [[Drug overdose|overdose]] may be confirmed by measurement of permethrin in [[Blood serum|serum]] or [[blood plasma]].<ref>R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 1215–1216.</ref>

Permethrin does not present any notable [[genotoxicity]] or [[immunotoxicity]] in humans and farm animals, but is classified by the EPA as a likely human [[carcinogen]], based on reproducible studies in which mice fed permethrin developed liver and lung [[tumor]]s.<ref>[http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/P1005J0O.TXT?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&Client=EPA&Index=2006+Thru+2010&Docs=&Query=&Time=&EndTime=&SearchMethod=1&TocRestrict=n&Toc=&TocEntry=&QField=&QFieldYear=&QFieldMonth=&QFieldDay=&IntQFieldOp=0&ExtQFieldOp=0&XmlQuery=&File=D%3A%5Czyfiles%5CIndex%20Data%5C06thru10%5CTxt%5C00000012%5CP1005J0O.txt&User=ANONYMOUS&Password=anonymous&SortMethod=h%7C-&MaximumDocuments=1&FuzzyDegree=0&ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&Display=p%7Cf&DefSeekPage=x&SearchBack=ZyActionL&Back=ZyActionS&BackDesc=Results%20page&MaximumPages=1&ZyEntry=1&SeekPage=x&ZyPURL Permethrin Facts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808101159/http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/P1005J0O.TXT?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&Client=EPA&Index=2006+Thru+2010&Docs=&Query=&Time=&EndTime=&SearchMethod=1&TocRestrict=n&Toc=&TocEntry=&QField=&QFieldYear=&QFieldMonth=&QFieldDay=&IntQFieldOp=0&ExtQFieldOp=0&XmlQuery=&File=D%3A%5Czyfiles%5CIndex%20Data%5C06thru10%5CTxt%5C00000012%5CP1005J0O.txt&User=ANONYMOUS&Password=anonymous&SortMethod=h%7C-&MaximumDocuments=1&FuzzyDegree=0&ImageQuality=r75g8%2Fr75g8%2Fx150y150g16%2Fi425&Display=p%7Cf&DefSeekPage=x&SearchBack=ZyActionL&Back=ZyActionS&BackDesc=Results%20page&MaximumPages=1&ZyEntry=1&SeekPage=x&ZyPURL |date=8 August 2016 }}, US EPA, June 2006.</ref>

== Pharmacokinetics ==

=== Absorption ===
Absorption of topical permethrin is minimal. One ''in vivo'' study demonstrated 0.5% absorption in the first 48 hours based upon excretion of urinary metabolites.<ref name="van der Rhee 1989 170–3">{{cite journal|last=van der Rhee|first=HJ|author2=Farquhar, JA |author3=Vermeulen, NP |title=Efficacy and transdermal absorption of permethrin in scabies patients.|journal=Acta dermato-venereologica|date=1989|volume=69|issue=2|pages=170–3|pmid=2564238}}</ref>

=== Distribution ===
Distribution of permethrin has been studied in rat models, with highest amounts accumulating in fat and the brain.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tornero-Velez|first=R |author2=Davis, J |author3=Scollon, EJ |author4=Starr, JM |author5=Setzer, RW |author6=Goldsmith, MR |author7=Chang, DT |author8=Xue, J |author9=Zartarian, V |author10=DeVito, MJ |author11=Hughes, MF|title=A pharmacokinetic model of cis- and trans-permethrin disposition in rats and humans with aggregate exposure application.|journal=Toxicological Sciences|date=Nov 2012|volume=130|issue=1|pages=33–47|pmid=22859315|doi=10.1093/toxsci/kfs236}}</ref> This can be explained by the lipophilic nature of the permethrin molecule.

=== Metabolism ===
Metabolism of permethrin occurs mainly in the liver, where the molecule undergoes oxidation by the cytochrome P450 system, as well as hydrolysis, into metabolites.<ref name="van der Rhee 1989 170–3" />
Elimination of these metabolites occurs via urinary excretion.

==Military use==
To better protect soldiers from the risk and annoyance of biting insects, the US<ref>[http://www.army.mil/article/88171/Army_s_new_ACUs_combat_insect_borne_diseases/ Insect-repelling ACUs now available to all Soldiers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004213322/http://www.army.mil/article/88171/Army_s_new_ACUs_combat_insect_borne_diseases/ |date=4 October 2013 }}, United States Army, Canadian and</ref> and British<ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/Black_Bag_A5_booklet.pdf Personal Clothing - British Army Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923185556/http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/Black_Bag_A5_booklet.pdf |date=23 September 2015 }}, What's In The Black Bag? Accessed 14 October 2015</ref> armies are treating all new uniforms with permethrin.

==Stereochemistry==
Permethrin has four [[Stereoisomerism|stereoisomers]] (two [[enantiomer|enantiomeric pairs]]), arising from the two [[stereocenter]]s in the [[cyclopropane]] ring. The ''[[Cis-trans isomerism|trans]]'' enantiomeric pair is known as transpermethrin.

== History ==
Permethrin was first made in 1973.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Elliott|first1=M|last2=Farnham|first2=AW|last3=Janes|first3=NF|last4=Needham|first4=PH|last5=Pulman|first5=DA|last6=Stevenson|first6=JH|title=A photostable pyrethroid.|journal=Nature|date=16 November 1973|volume=246|issue=5429|pages=169–70|pmid=4586114}}</ref>

Numerous synthetic routes exist for the production of the DV-acid ester precursor. The pathway known as the Kuraray Process uses four steps.<ref name="Leonard A. Wasselle 1981" /> In general, the final step in the total synthesis of any of the synthetic pyrethroids is a coupling of a DV-acid ester and an alcohol.  In the case of permethrin synthesis, the DV-acid cyclopropanecarboxylic acid, 3-(2,2-dichloroethenyl)-2,2-dimethyl-, ethyl ester, is coupled with the alcohol, m-phenoxybenzyl alcohol, through a transesterification reaction with base.  Tetraisopropyl titanate or sodium ethylate may be used as the base.<ref name="Leonard A. Wasselle 1981">Leonard A. Wasselle, "Pyrethroid Insecticides." SRI International Report #143, Menlo Park, CA, 94025, June 1981.</ref>

The alcohol precursor may be prepared in three steps.  First, m-cresol, chlorobenzene, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and copper chloride react to yield m-phenoxytoluene.  Second, oxidation of m-phenoxytoluene over selenium dioxide provides m-phenoxybenzaldehyde.  Third, a Cannizzaro reaction of the benzaldehyde in formaldehyde and potassium hydroxide affords the m-phenoxybenzyl alcohol.<ref name="Leonard A. Wasselle 1981" />

==Brand names==
It is marketed by [[Johnson & Johnson]] under the name Lyclear. In Nordic countries and North America, it is marketed under trade name Nix, often available over the counter.

Toxic exposure of permethrin can cause several symptoms, including [[convulsion]], [[hyperaesthesia]], [[hyperthermia]], [[hypersalivation]], and loss of balance and  coordination. Exposure to [[pyrethroid]]-derived drugs such as permethrin requires treatment by a veterinarian, otherwise the poisoning is often fatal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aspcapro.org/sites/pro/files/d-veccs_april00.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-12-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203012957/http://www.aspcapro.org/sites/pro/files/d-veccs_april00.pdf |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Permethrin toxicity in cats: a retrospective study of 20 cases|vauthors=Dymond NL, Swift IM|work=nih.gov|pmid=18498556|doi=10.1111/j.1751-0813.2008.00298.x|volume=86|issue=6|year=2008|pages=219–23}}</ref> This intolerance is due to a defect in [[glucuronosyltransferase]], a common detoxification enzyme in other mammals (that also makes the cat intolerant to paracetamol and many essential oils).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.depecheveterinaire.com/basedocudv/actualites_dermatologiques_etude_retrospective_australienne_signes_nerveux_digestifs.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227010357/http://www.depecheveterinaire.com/basedocudv/actualites_dermatologiques_etude_retrospective_australienne_signes_nerveux_digestifs.pdf |archivedate=27 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The use of any external parasiticides based on permethrin is contraindicated for cats.
