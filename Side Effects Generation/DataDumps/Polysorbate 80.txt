'''Polysorbate 80''' is a nonionic [[surfactant]] and [[emulsifier]] often used in foods and cosmetics. This synthetic compound is a viscous, water-soluble yellow liquid.

==Chemistry==
Polysorbate 80 is derived from [[ethoxylation|polyethoxylated]] [[sorbitan]] and [[oleic acid]]. The [[hydrophilic]] groups in this compound are poly[[ether]]s also known as polyoxyethylene groups, which are polymers of [[ethylene oxide]].  In the nomenclature of polysorbates, the numeric designation following polysorbate refers to the [[lipophilic]] group, in this case the oleic acid (see [[polysorbate]] for more detail).

The full chemical names for polysorbate 80 are:
*Polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monooleate
*(x)-sorbitan mono-9-octadecenoate poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl)

The [[critical micelle concentration]] of polysorbate 80 in pure water is reported as 0.012&nbsp;mM.<ref name="DannyK">{{cite journal |vauthors=Chou DK, Krishnamurthy R, Randolph TW, Carpenter JF, Manning MC |title=Effects of Tween 20 and Tween 80 on the stability of Albutropin during agitation |journal=[[J Pharm Sci]] |volume=94 |issue=6 |pages=1368–81 |date=June 2005 |pmid=15858848 |doi=10.1002/jps.20365 |url=}}</ref>

==Uses==

===Food use===
Polysorbate 80 is used as an emulsifier in foods.

For example, in ice cream, polysorbate is added up to 0.5% (v/v) concentration to make the ice cream smoother and easier to handle, as well as increasing its resistance to melting.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/S0958-6946(97)00040-X| issn = 0958-6946| volume = 7| issue = 6–7| pages = 363–373| last = Goff| first = H. Douglas| title = Colloidal aspects of ice cream—A review| journal = International Dairy Journal| year = 1997}}</ref> Adding this substance prevents [[milk]] proteins from completely coating the [[fat]] droplets. This allows them to join together in chains and nets, which hold air in the mixture, and provide a firmer texture that holds its shape as the ice cream melts.

===Health and beauty use===
Polysorbate 80 is also used as a surfactant in soaps and cosmetics (including eyedrops), or a [[solubilizer]] such as in a mouthwash. The cosmetic grade of polysorbate 80 may have more impurities than the food grade.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is Polysorbate 80?|url=http://blog.honest.com/polysorbate-80/|work=The Honest Company Blog|publisher=The Honest Company|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref>

===Medical use===
Polysorbate 80 is an [[excipient]] that is used to stabilize aqueous formulations of medications for [[parenteral]] administration, and used as an [[emulsifier]] in the manufacture of the popular antiarrhythmic [[amiodarone]].<ref>{{cite web|last = Gautier & Bellamy|title = Pharmaceutical amiodarone composition for parenteral delivery|url = http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6143778.html|accessdate = 2008-04-06}}</ref> It is also used as an excipient in some European and Canadian [[influenza vaccine]]s.<ref name=H1N1>[http://www.wrha.mb.ca/professionals/influenza/files/orientation/Orientation_4-A.pdf Pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) Influenza Vaccine Quick Reference Guide] ''Winnipeg Regional Health Authority'' 2009</ref> Influenza vaccines contain 25</span>&nbsp;<span>μg of polysorbate 80 per dose.<ref name="H1N1" /> 
It is also used in the culture of ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' in Middlebrook 7H9 broth. It is also used as an emulsifier in the estrogen-regulating drug Estrasorb.<ref>http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2003/21371_estrasorb_lbl.pdf</ref>

===Laboratory use===
Some [[mycobacteria]] contain a type of [[lipase]] (enzyme that breaks up [[lipid]] molecules); when these species are added to a mixture of polysorbate 80 and [[phenol red]], they cause the solution to change color, so this is used as a test to identify the [[Phenotypic testing of Mycobacteria|phenotype]] of a strain or isolate.

==Consumption and potential effects==
{{medref|section|date=February 2015}}
In Europe and America, people eat about 100&nbsp;mg of polysorbate 80 in foods per day on average.<ref name="Hara2">{{Cite journal| first1 = M.

=== Lowered body weight of offspring ===
A 2008 animal study concluded no observable adverse effects were seen at doses per body weight up to 1.85&nbsp;ml/kg·day, which is equivalent to a 70&nbsp;kg person consuming about 140&nbsp;g of this substance per day for 21 days. However, administration of 16.783&nbsp;ml/kg·day to pregnant rats lowered body weight in male and female offspring.<ref name="Hara2"/> This is equivalent to a person consuming about 1.3&nbsp;kg of polysorbate 80 per day for 21 days.

=== Decreased fertility ===
A 1956 study saw no effect on reproduction in rats during their lifetime at up to 5% of their diet being polysorbate 80. Reproduction decreased at 20% of their diet.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Oser |first1=B L |last2=Oser |first2=M |title=Nutritional studies on rats of diets containing high levels of partial ester emulsifiers.

=== Impact on mouse gut microbiota ===
Relatively low concentrations of two commonly used emulsifiers, namely [[Carboxymethyl cellulose|carboxymethylcellulose]] and Polysorbate-80, induced low-grade inflammation and obesity/metabolic syndrome in wild-type hosts and promoted robust colitis in mice predisposed to this disorder.  Use of germ-free mice and fecal transplants indicated that such changes in microbiota were necessary and sufficient for both low-grade inflammation and metabolic syndrome.<ref name=ChassaingKoren2015>{{cite journal |title = Dietary emulsifiers impact the mouse gut microbiota promoting colitis and metabolic syndrome |url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v519/n7541/full/nature14232.html |journal = Nature |date = March 5, 2015|issn = 0028-0836|pages = 92–96|volume = 519|issue = 7541|doi = 10.1038/nature14232 |first = Benoit|last = Chassaing|first2 = Omry|last2 = Koren|first3 = Julia K.|last3 = Goodrich|first4 = Angela C.|last4 = Poole|first5 = Shanthi|last5 = Srinivasan|first6 = Ruth E.|last6 = Ley|first7 = Andrew T.|last7 = Gewirtz}}</ref>
