'''Lebrikizumab''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) is a [[humanized monoclonal antibody]] and an experimental [[immunosuppressive drug]] for the treatment of [[asthma]] that cannot be adequately controlled with inhalable [[glucocorticoid]]s. The drug was created by [[Tanox]] under the name ''TNX-650'', and a phase I [[clinical trial]] for refractory [[Hodgkin’s lymphoma]] had been performed when [[Genentech]] acquired Tanox in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biospace.com/news_story.aspx?NewsEntityId=19463 |title=First Patient Dosed In Phase 1 Trial Of Tanox, Inc.'s TNX-650 - News, Search Jobs, Events |accessdate=8 July 2008 |format= |work=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/drugdictionary/?CdrID=539362|title=anti-IL-13 humanized monoclonal antibody TNX-650|work=NCI Drug Dictionary|publisher=[[National Cancer Institute]]|accessdate=10 December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00441818|Safety and Efficacy Study of TNX-650 to Treat Refractory Hodgkin's Lymphoma}}</ref> It has successfully completed a Phase II clinical trial for the treatment of asthma.<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00930163|A Study of Lebrikizumab (MILR1444A) in Adult Patients With Asthma Who Are Inadequately Controlled on Inhaled Corticosteroids (MILLY)}}</ref><ref name="Kraft">{{Cite journal

==Mechanism of action==
Lebrikizumab blocks [[interleukin 13]] (IL-13), a [[cytokine]] (cell-signalling protein) that is produced by [[Th2 cell]]s, a type of [[white blood cell]]s. IL-13 is thought to induce the expression of another signalling protein, [[periostin]], by [[epithelial cell]]s of the [[bronchi]]. Periostin in turn seems to partake in a number of asthma related problems, such as [[bronchial hyperresponsiveness]], inflammation, and activation and [[Cell proliferation|proliferation]] of airway [[fibroblast]]s, which are involved in airway remodelling.<ref name="Kraft" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prous.com/molecules/default.asp?ID=214 |title=Prous Science Molecule of the Month: Lebrikizumab |date=October 2011 |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]]}}</ref>

This theory is supported by the fact that patients with high periostin levels responded significantly better to lebrikizumab in the Phase II study: the [[FEV1|forced expiratory volume in 1 second]] (FEV1) was 8.2% higher than under placebo in this group (measured from the respective baselines), while low-periostin patients had 1.6% higher FEV1, and the average value for all patients was 5.5%. The FEV1 increase in low-periostin patients was not statistically significant.<ref name="Corren">{{Cite journal

==Side effects==
In the study, musculoskeletal side effects were more common under lebrikizumab than under [[placebo]] (13.2% versus 5.4%). Other side effects were comparable in both groups: infections overall 48.1% versus 49.1%, upper airway infections 12.3% versus 14.3%, and severe side effects overall 3.8% (treatment) versus 5.3% (placebo).<ref name="Corren" />
