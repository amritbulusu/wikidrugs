'''Ketobemidone''', sold under the brand name '''Ketogan''' among others, is a powerful [[opioid]] [[analgesic|painkiller]]. Its effectiveness against pain is in the same range as [[morphine]], and it also has some [[NMDA]]-antagonist properties imparted, in part, by its metabolite norketobemidone.<ref name=NMDA98>{{cite journal|last1=Ebert|first1=B|last2=Thorkildsen|first2=C|last3=Andersen|first3=S|last4=Christrup|first4=LL|last5=Hjeds|first5=H|title=Opioid analgesics as noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists.|journal=Biochemical Pharmacology|date=1 September 1998|volume=56|issue=5|pages=553-9|doi=10.1016/S0006-2952(98)00088-4|pmid=9783723}}</ref> This may make it useful for some types of pain that do not respond well to other opioids.<ref name="NMDA98"/> It is marketed in [[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] and is used for severe pain.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ketobemidone Hydrochloride: Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference|website=MedicinesComplete|publisher=Pharmaceutical Press|date=9 January 2017|accessdate=6 September 2017|editor=Brayfield, A|location=London, UK|url=https://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/martindale/current/15938-v.htm}}</ref>

==History==
Ketobemidone was first synthesized in 1942 by Eisleb and colleagues,<ref>{{ cite patent | country = GB | number = 609763 | status = patent | title = Manufacture of piperidyl ketones | assign1 = Ciba Ltd. | pubdate = 1948-10-06 }}</ref> at the laboratory of [[IG Farben|I.G. Farbenindustrie]] at Hoechst during the Second World War. The first study of it in humans was published in 1946,<ref>{{ cite patent | country = US | number = 2486796 | status = patent | title = Esters of 1-alkyl-4-hydroxyphenyl-piperidil-4-ketones | gdate = 1949-11-01 | inventor = Meischer, K.; Kaegi, H. }}</ref> and it was introduced in clinical medicine shortly after.  It was not in clinical use in the United States when the Controlled Substances Act 1970 was promulgated and was assigned to Schedule I with an ACSCN of 9628.  As of 2013, no annual manufacturing quota was assigned by the DEA.<ref>http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/quotas/2013/fr0620.htm</ref>

[[Pfizer]] manufactures ketobemidone under the tradenames Ketogan and Ketorax. It is available as [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]], [[suppositories]], and injection fluid. A sustained release formulation exists, sold as Ketodur, in some countries containing 10 or 25&nbsp;mg ketobemidone.

==Pharmacology==
Experiments on former addicts indicated it was more addictive than other opioids, so in 1954 the Economic and Social Council took a resolution urging governments to stop manufacture and use of ketobemidone.<ref name=unodc>{{ cite journal | title = Development of Synthetic Narcotic Drugs | publisher = [[UNODC]] | journal = Bulletin on Narcotic Drugs | year = 1956 | volume = 1956 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–14 | url = http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1956-01-01_1_page003.html | accessdate = 2012-07-05 }}</ref> This result was not in agreement with clinical observations, and another study in 1958 did not find it more addictive than morphine. That study noticed that while for morphine the dose for [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]] is the same as that for analgesia, for ketobemidone the analgesic dose was well below the euphoric dose.<ref name=Bondesson>{{ cite journal | author = Bondesson, U. | title = Biological Fate of Ketobemidone in Man | journal = Abstracts of Uppsala Dissertations from the Faculty of Pharmacy | volume = 68 | year = 1982 | url = http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:298192 | isbn = 91-554-1243-2 }}</ref>
Ketobemidone is mostly used in the [[Scandinavia]]n countries, with [[Denmark]] topping the statistics.<ref name=incb>{{ cite web | publisher = [[INCB]] | year = 2004 | title = Statistical Information on Narcotic Drugs | url = http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/tr/nar/2004/narcotics_part4.pdf | format = pdf | accessdate = 2006-09-07 }}</ref>

Analgesia after 5-10 [[milligram|mg]] orally or 5-7.5&nbsp;mg [[intravenous]]ly lasts 3–5 hours. Ketobemidone is also available in preparations with a [[muscle relaxant#Spasmolytics|spasmolytic]], which can improve the analgesia.

==Metabolism==
Ketobemidone is mainly metabolized by [[xenobiotic conjugation|conjugation]] of the phenolic hydroxyl group, and by ''N''-demethylation. Only about 13-24% is excreted unchanged after intravenous administration.<ref>{{Cite journal

==Chemistry==
Ketobemidone is 1-methyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-4-propionylpiperidine.  It is usually available as the [[hydrochloride]], which is a white powder. It is synthesized by alkylating (3-methoxyphenyl)acetonitrile with [[bis(2-chloroethyl)methylamine]], followed by reaction with [[ethylmagnesium bromide]], and finally O-demethylation with [[hydrobromic acid]].<ref>{{cite book | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=_J2ti4EkYpkC&pg=PA936 | title = Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Encyclopedia | chapter = Cetobemidone | author = William Andrew Publishing | publisher = Elsevier | year = 2013 | format = excerpt}}</ref>

Because of a strong vesicant nature of bis(2-chloroethyl)methylamine there are many other routes developed for obtaining ketobemidone. A route depicted below lays through first alkylating the same (3-methoxyphenyl)acetonitrile with 2-chloro-''N'',''N''-dimethylethylamine or 2-chloro-''N''-benzyl-''N''-methylethylamine.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Avison   | first1 = A.

The later yields ketobemidone after Grignard reaction with ethylmagnesium bromide and ether cleavage.
