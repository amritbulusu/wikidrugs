'''Ofatumumab'''<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Bodi|title=Ofatumumab|journal=MAbs|year=2009|volume=1|issue=4|pages=326–331|doi=10.4161/mabs.1.4.8895|url=http://www.landesbioscience.com/journals/17/article/8895/|pmid=20068404|pmc=2726602}}</ref> (trade name '''Arzerra''', also known as HuMax-CD20) is a fully human [[monoclonal antibody]] (for the [[CD20]] protein) which appears to inhibit early-stage B lymphocyte activation.  It is FDA approved for treating [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]] that is refractory to [[fludarabine]] and [[alemtuzumab]] (Campath) and has also shown potential in treating [[follicular lymphoma]], [[diffuse large B cell lymphoma]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and relapsing remitting [[multiple sclerosis]].  Ofatumumab has also received conditional approval in Europe for the treatment of refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This makes ofatumumab the first marketing application for an antibody produced by [[Genmab]], as well as the first human monoclonal antibody which targets the CD20 molecule that will be available for patients with refractory CLL.

==Medical uses==
Its only indication that has received regulatory approval is [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]] (CLL).<ref name = DM>{{cite web|title=ARZERRA (ofatumumab) injection, solution [GlaxoSmithKline LLC]|work=DailyMed|publisher=GlaxoSmithKline LLC|date=September 2013|accessdate=24 January 2014|url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=e6e738dc-9026-4cd3-8f85-7b10ac730e7d}}</ref><ref name = EMA>{{cite web|title=Arzerra : EPAR - Product Information|work=European Medicines Agency|publisher=Glaxo Group Ltd|date=7 March 2013|accessdate=24 January 2014|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Product_Information/human/001131/WC500093091.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref><ref name = EMC>{{cite web|title=Arzerra (acetate formulation) -Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC)|work=electronic Medicines Compendium|publisher=GlaxoSmithKline UK|date=27 November 2013|accessdate=24 January 2014|url=http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/23022/SPC/Arzerra+(acetate+formulation)/}}</ref>

Ofatumumab has received a [[black box warning]] regarding the potential for it to cause [[progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy]] and [[hepatitis B]] reactivation.<ref name = MSR>{{cite web|title=Arzerra (ofatumumab) dosing, indications, interactions, and more|work=Medscape Reference|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=24 January 2014|url=http://reference.medscape.com/drug/arzerra-ofatumumab-999309#showall}}</ref> Likewise it is also advised that doctors watch cautiously for small bowel obstruction, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, infusion reactions or an increased risk for infection.<ref name = MSR/>

===Contraindications===
It is contraindicated in individuals that have hypersensitivity to ofatumumab or any of its excipients.<ref name = EMC/>

===Interactions===
No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted with ofatumumab.<ref name = DM/> Although it is advised that patients are not administered live virus vaccines (e.g. the oral polio vaccine) while undergoing treatment with ofatumumab due to the compromised ability to fight the attenuated viruses seen in patients being treated with ofatumumab.<ref name = MSR/>

==Mechanism==
Ofatumumab is a humanised anti-[[CD20]] monoclonal antibody whose epitope is distinct from that of [[rituximab]].<ref name = Mech>{{cite journal|title=Ofatumumab: a novel monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody|journal=Pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine|date=2010|volume=3|pages=51–59|pmid=23226042|pmc=3513208|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3513208/pdf/pgpm-3-051.pdf|format=PDF|author=Lin, TS}}</ref> The CD20 antigen is expressed on solely B cell lymphocytes.<ref name = Mech/> Compared with rituximab, ofatumumab binds more tightly to CD20 with a slower off-rate.<ref name = Mech/> It causes cytotoxicity in the cells that express CD20 by means of [[complement-dependent cytotoxicity]] (CDC) and [[antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity]] (ADCC).<ref name = Mech/>
