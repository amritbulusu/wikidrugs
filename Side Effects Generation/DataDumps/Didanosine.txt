'''Didanosine''' ('''ddI''', '''DDI'''), marketed under the trade names '''Videx''', is an medication used to treat [[HIV/AIDS]]. It is used in combination with other medications as part of [[highly active antiretroviral therapy]] (HAART). It is of the [[reverse transcriptase inhibitor]] class.

<!-- Society and culture -->
Didanosine was first described in 1975 and approved for use in the United States in 1991.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fischer|first1=Janos|last2=Ganellin|first2=C. Robin|title=Analogue-based Drug Discovery|date=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9783527607495|page=505|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FjKfqkaKkAAC&pg=PA505|language=en}}</ref> It is on the [[World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines]], a list of the most important medication needed in a basic [[health system]].<ref>{{cite web|title=WHO Model List of EssentialMedicines|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/93142/1/EML_18_eng.pdf?ua=1|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=22 April 2014|date=October 2013}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
The most common adverse events with didanosine are [[diarrhea]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[abdominal pain]], [[fever]], [[headache]] and [[rash]]. Peripheral [[neuropathy]] occurred in 21-26% of participants in key didanosine trials.<ref name="Videxpi" />

[[Pancreatitis]] is rarely observed but has caused occasional fatalities, and has [[black box warning]] status. Other reported serious adverse events are retinal changes, [[optic neuritis]] and alterations of liver functions. The risk of some of these serious adverse events is increased by drinking alcohol.

In February 2010, the United States Food and Drug Administration issued a statement that patients using Didanosine (Videx) are at risk for a rare
but potentially fatal liver disorder, non-cirrhotic portal hypertension.<ref>http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_HIV_DRUG_LIVER_RISKS?SITE=KYB66&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT</ref>

==Drug interactions==
*A significant interaction has also been recorded with [[allopurinol]], and administration of these drugs together should be avoided.<ref name="Videxpi" />
*Reduction in [[indinavir]] and [[delavirdine]] plasma levels have been shown to occur when administered simultaneously with didanosine; these drugs should be administered at different times.<ref name="Videxpi" />
*[[Ketoconazole]], [[itraconazole]], [[ciprofloxacin]] should be administered at a different time from didanosine due to interactions with the buffering agent.<ref name="Videxpi" />
*Administration with drugs with overlapping toxicity, such as [[zalcitabine]] and [[stavudine]], is not recommended.<ref name="dhhs">DHHS panel.

*[[Alcohol]] can exacerbate didanosine's toxicity, and avoiding drinking alcohol while taking didanosine is recommended.<ref name="Videxpi" />

==Resistance==
Drug resistance to didanosine does develop, though slower than to [[zidovudine]] (AZT). The most common mutation observed ''in vivo'' is L74V in the viral ''pol'' gene, which confers cross-resistance to [[zalcitabine]]; other mutations observed include K65R and M184V .<ref name="Videxpi" /><ref name="Moyle">{{cite journal | last1 = Moyle | first1 = GJ | year = 1996 | title = Use of viral resistance patterns to antiretroviral drugs in optimising selection of drug combinations and sequences | url = | journal = Drugs | volume = 52 | issue = | pages = 168–185 | doi=10.2165/00003495-199652020-00002}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Didanosine (ddI) is a [[nucleoside]] [[structural analog|analogue]] of [[adenosine]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pruvost|first1=A|title=Measurement of Intracellular Didanosine and Tenofovir Phosphorylated Metabolites and Possible Interaction of the Two Drugs in Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Infected Patients|journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy|date=2005|doi=10.1128/AAC.49.5.1907-1914.2005|url=http://aac.asm.org/content/49/5/1907|accessdate=25 July 2015|volume=49|pages=1907–1914|pmid=15855513|pmc=1087635}}</ref> It differs from other nucleoside analogues, because it does not have any of the regular bases, instead it has [[hypoxanthine]] attached to the sugar ring. Within the cell, ddI is phosphorylated to the active metabolite of dideoxyadenosine triphosphate, ddATP, by cellular enzymes.  Like other anti-HIV nucleoside analogs, it acts as a chain terminator by incorporation and inhibits viral [[reverse transcriptase]] by competing with natural [[Adenosine triphosphate|dATP]].

==Pharmacokinetics==
Oral absorption of didanosine is fairly low (42%)<ref name="Videxpi">[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.Overview&DrugName=VIDEX VIDEX (didanosine): chewable/dispersible buffered tablets; buffered powder for oral solution; pediatric powder for oral solution. Product information (July 2000)]</ref> but rapid. Food substantially reduces didanosine bioavailability, and the drug should be administered on an empty stomach.<ref name="Videxpi" /> The half-life in plasma is only 1.5 hours,<ref name="Videxpi" /> but in the intracellular environment more than 12 hours.  An enteric-coated formulation is now marketed as well.  Elimination is predominantly renal; the kidneys actively secrete didanosine, the amount being 20% of the oral dose.

==History==
The related pro-drug of didanosine, 2′,3′-dideoxyadenosine (ddA), was initially synthesized by Morris J. Robins (professor of Organic Chemistry at Brigham Young University) and R.K. Robins in 1964.  Subsequently, [[Samuel Broder]], [[Hiroaki Mitsuya]], and [[Robert Yarchoan]] in the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI) found that ddA and ddI could inhibit HIV replication in the test tube and conducted initial clinical trials showing that didanosine had activity in patients infected with HIV. On behalf of the NCI, they were awarded patents on these activities. Since the NCI does not market products directly, the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) awarded a ten-year exclusive license to [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] Co. (BMS) to market and sell ddI as Videx tablets.

Didanosine became the second drug approved for the treatment of HIV infection in many other countries, including in the United States by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) on October 9, 1991. Its FDA approval helped bring down the price of [[zidovudine]] (AZT), the initial anti-HIV drug. [Source needed on pricing effect.]

Didanosine has weak acid stability and is easily damaged by stomach acid. Therefore, the original formula approved by the FDA used chewable tablets that included an [[antacid]] buffering compound to neutralize stomach acid. The chewable tablets were not only large and fragile, they also were foul-tasting and the buffering compound would cause diarrhea.  Although the FDA had not approved the original formulation for once-a-day dosing it was possible for some people to take it that way.

At the end of its ten-year license, BMS re-formulated Videx as Videx EC and patented that, which reformulation the FDA approved in 2000. The new formulation is a smaller capsule containing coated microspheres instead of using a buffering compound. It is approved by the FDA for once-a-day dosing. Also at the end of that ten-year period, the NIH licensed didanosine to Barr Laboratories under a non-exclusive license, and didanosine became the first generic anti-HIV drug marketed in the United States.

One of the patents for ddI expired in the United States on August 29, 2006, but other patents extend beyond that time.
