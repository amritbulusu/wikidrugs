'''Dexmedetomidine''', sold under the trade name '''Precedex''' among others, is an [[anxiolytic|anxiety reducing]], [[sedative]], and [[analgesic|pain medication]]. Dexmedetomidine is notable for its ability to provide sedation without risk of respiratory depression (unlike other commonly used sedatives such as [[propofol]], [[fentanyl]], and [[midazolam]]) and can provide cooperative or semi-arousable sedation. 

Similar to [[clonidine]], it is an [[agonist]] of [[alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor]]s in certain parts of the brain.<ref name="Cormack2005" /> Dexmedetomidine hydrochloride is also used in veterinary medicine for dogs and cats.<ref>http://www.dexdomitor.com/</ref> The drug was developed by [[Orion Pharma]].

==Medical uses==

===Intensive care unit sedation===
Dexmedetomidine is most often used in the intensive care setting for light to moderate sedation. It is not recommended for long term deep sedation. A unique feature of dexmedetomidine is that it has analgesic properties in addition to its role as a hypnotic, but is opioid sparing, and is therefore not associated with significant respiratory depression (unlike propofol).

Many studies suggest dexmedetomidine for sedation in mechanically ventilated adults may reduce time to [[extubation]] and ICU stay.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Dexmedetomidine as a sedative agent in critically ill patients: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials|journal = PLOS ONE|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 1932-6203|pmc = 3877008|pmid = 24391726|pages = e82913|volume = 8|issue = 12|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0082913|first = Laura|last = Pasin|first2 = Teresa|last2 = Greco|first3 = Paolo|last3 = Feltracco|first4 = Annalisa|last4 = Vittorio|first5 = Caetano Nigro|last5 = Neto|first6 = Luca|last6 = Cabrini|first7 = Giovanni|last7 = Landoni|first8 = Gabriele|last8 = Finco|first9 = Alberto|last9 = Zangrillo}}</ref><ref name="Chen CD010269">{{Cite journal|title = Alpha-2 agonists for long-term sedation during mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients|journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date = 2015-01-01|issn = 1469-493X|pmid = 25879090|pages = CD010269|volume = 1|first = Ken|last = Chen|first2 = Zhijun|last2 = Lu|first3 = Yi Chun|last3 = Xin|first4 = Yong|last4 = Cai|first5 = Yi|last5 = Chen|first6 = Shu Ming|last6 = Pan|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010269.pub2}}</ref> People on dexmedetomidine are arousable and cooperative, and as such are able to actively cooperate with various procedures.

Compared with other sedatives, some studies suggest dexmedetomidine may be associated with less [[delirium]].<ref name="MacLaren 167–175">{{Cite journal|title = A randomized, double-blind pilot study of dexmedetomidine versus midazolam for intensive care unit sedation: patient recall of their experiences and short-term psychological outcomes|journal = Journal of Intensive Care Medicine|date = 2015-03-01|issn = 1525-1489|pmid = 24227448|pages = 167–175|volume = 30|issue = 3|doi = 10.1177/0885066613510874|first = Robert|last = MacLaren|first2 = Candice R.|last2 = Preslaski|first3 = Scott W.|last3 = Mueller|first4 = Tyree H.|last4 = Kiser|first5 = Douglas N.|last5 = Fish|first6 = James C.|last6 = Lavelle|first7 = Stephen P.|last7 = Malkoski}}</ref> However, this finding is not consistent across multiple studies.<ref name="Chen CD010269" /> At the very least, when aggregating many study results together, usage of dexmedetomidine appears to be associated with less neurocognitive dysfunction compared to other sedatives.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Neurocognitive dysfunction risk alleviation with the use of dexmedetomidine in perioperative conditions or as ICU sedation: a meta-analysis|journal = Medicine|date = 2015-04-01|issn = 1536-5964|pmc = 4554047|pmid = 25860207|pages = e597|volume = 94|issue = 14|doi = 10.1097/MD.0000000000000597|first = Bo|last = Li|first2 = Huixia|last2 = Wang|first3 = Hui|last3 = Wu|first4 = Chengjie|last4 = Gao}}</ref> Whether this has beneficial psychological impact is unclear.<ref name="MacLaren 167–175"/>  From an economic perspective, dexmedetomidine is associated with lower ICU costs.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Dexmedetomidine versus standard care sedation with propofol or midazolam in intensive care: an economic evaluation|journal = Critical Care (London, England)|date = 2015-01-01|issn = 1466-609X|pmc = 4391080|pmid = 25887576|pages = 67|volume = 19|doi = 10.1186/s13054-015-0787-y|first = Heidi|last = Turunen|first2 = Stephan M.|last2 = Jakob|first3 = Esko|last3 = Ruokonen|first4 = Kirsi-Maija|last4 = Kaukonen|first5 = Toni|last5 = Sarapohja|first6 = Marjo|last6 = Apajasalo|first7 = Jukka|last7 = Takala}}</ref> These decreased costs are largely due to a shorter time to extubation.

===Procedural sedation===

Dexmedetomidine can also be used as sedoanalgesic for procedural sedation, such as during colonoscopy.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = A comparison of dexmedetomidine versus midazolam for sedation, pain and hemodynamic control, during colonoscopy under conscious sedation|journal = European Journal of Anaesthesiology|date = 2010-07-01|issn = 1365-2346|pmid = 20531094|pages = 648–652|volume = 27|issue = 7|doi = 10.1097/EJA.0b013e3283347bfe|first = Kamer|last = Dere|first2 = Ilker|last2 = Sucullu|first3 = Ersel Tan|last3 = Budak|first4 = Suleyman|last4 = Yeyen|first5 = Ali Ilker|last5 = Filiz|first6 = Sezai|last6 = Ozkan|first7 = Guner|last7 = Dagli}}</ref> It can be used as an adjunct with other sedatives like [[benzodiazepine]]s, [[opioid]]s, and propofol to enhance sedation and help maintain hemodynamic stability by decreasing the requirement of other sedatives.<ref name=Paris2005/><ref>{{Cite journal|title = Alpha-2 Adrenergic Receptor Agonists: A Review of Current Clinical Applications|journal = Anesthesia Progress|date = 2015-01-01|issn = 0003-3006|pmc = 4389556|pmid = 25849473|pages = 31–38|volume = 62|issue = 1|doi = 10.2344/0003-3006-62.1.31|first = Joseph A.|last = Giovannitti|first2 = Sean M.|last2 = Thoms|first3 = James J.|last3 = Crawford}}</ref> Dexmedetomidine is also used for procedural sedation in children.<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 25188619| year = 2014| author1 = Ahmed| first1 = S.

===Other===
Dexmedetomidine may be useful for the treatment of the negative cardiovascular effects of acute [[Substituted amphetamine|amphetamines]] and [[cocaine]] [[Cocaine intoxication|intoxication]] and [[overdose]].<ref name=Menon2007/><ref name="Richards_2015">{{cite journal | url=http://www.drugandalcoholdependence.com/article/S0376-8716%2815%2900075-7/abstract | title=Treatment of toxicity from amphetamines, related derivatives, and analogues: A systematic clinical review. |author1=John R.

===Dosage and administration===
Intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine is commonly initiated with a loading dose followed by a maintenance infusion. There may be great individual variability in the hemodynamic effects (especially on heart rate and blood pressure), as well as the sedative effects of this drug. For this reason, the dose must be carefully adjusted to achieve the desired clinical effect.<ref name=Dosing/>

==Side effects==
There are no absolute contraindications to the use of dexmedetomidine. Dexmedetomidine has a biphasic effect on blood pressure with decreased blood pressure observed at lower concentrations and elevated blood pressure at higher concentrations.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The effects of increasing plasma concentrations of dexmedetomidine in humans|journal = Anesthesiology|date = 2000-08-01|issn = 0003-3022|pmid = 10910487|pages = 382–394|volume = 93|issue = 2|first = T.

== Interactions ==
Dexmedetomidine may enhance the effects of other sedatives and anesthetics when co-administered. Similarly, drugs that lower blood pressure and heart rate, such as [[beta blocker]]s, may also have enhanced effects when co-administered with dexmedetomidine.<ref name="Keating 1119–1130"/>

== Pharmacodynamics ==
Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective [[alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic]]  agonist. Unlike opioids and other sedatives such as propofol, dexmedetomidine is able to achieve its effects without causing respiratory depression. Dexmedetomidine induces sedation by decreasing activity of noradrenergic neurons in the [[Locus coeruleus|locus ceruleus]] in the [[Brainstem|brain stem]], thereby increasing the activity of inhibitory [[Gamma-Aminobutyric acid|gamma-aminobutyric acid]] neurons in the [[ventrolateral preoptic nucleus]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist dexmedetomidine converges on an endogenous sleep-promoting pathway to exert its sedative effects|journal = Anesthesiology|date = 2003-02-01|issn = 0003-3022|pmid = 12552203|pages = 428–436|volume = 98|issue = 2|first = Laura E.|last = Nelson|first2 = Jun|last2 = Lu|first3 = Tianzhi|last3 = Guo|first4 = Clifford B.|last4 = Saper|first5 = Nicholas P.|last5 = Franks|first6 = Mervyn|last6 = Maze|doi=10.1097/00000542-200302000-00024}}</ref> In contrast{{Clarification needed|date=April 2017}}, other sedatives like propofol and benzodiazepines directly increase activity of [[Gamma-Aminobutyric acid|gamma-aminobutyric acid]] neurons.<ref name="Panzer 451–469, vii">{{Cite journal|title = Pharmacology of sedative-analgesic agents: dexmedetomidine, remifentanil, ketamine, volatile anesthetics, and the role of peripheral mu antagonists|journal = Critical Care Clinics|date = 2009-07-01|issn = 1557-8232|pmid = 19576524|pages = 451–469, vii|volume = 25|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.ccc.2009.04.004|first = Oliver|last = Panzer|first2 = Vivek|last2 = Moitra|first3 = Robert N.|last3 = Sladen}}</ref> Sedation by dexemeditomidine mirrors natural sleep.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Electroencephalogram spindle activity during dexmedetomidine sedation and physiological sleep|journal = Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica|date = 2008-02-01|issn = 1399-6576|pmid = 18005372|pages = 289–294|volume = 52|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/j.1399-6576.2007.01537.x|first = E.|last = Huupponen|first2 = A.|last2 = Maksimow|first3 = P.|last3 = Lapinlampi|first4 = M.|last4 = Särkelä|first5 = A.|last5 = Saastamoinen|first6 = A.|last6 = Snapir|first7 = H.|last7 = Scheinin|first8 = M.|last8 = Scheinin|first9 = P.|last9 = Meriläinen}}</ref> As such, dexmedetomidine provides less amnesia than benzodiazepines.<ref name="Panzer 451–469, vii"/> Dexmedetomidine also has analgesic effects at the spinal cord level and other supraspinal sites.<ref name="Panzer 451–469, vii"/> Thus, unlike other hypnotic agents like propofol, dexmedetomidine can be used as an adjunct medication to help decrease the opioid requirements of people in pain while still providing similar analgesia.

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Intravenous dexmedetomidine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics with a rapid distribution half-life of approximately 6 minutes and a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 2 hours. Plasma protein binding of dexemedotomindine is ~94% (mostly albumin).<ref>{{Cite web|title = Precedex (Dexmedetomidine hydrochloride) Drug Information: Clinical Pharmacology - Prescribing Information at RxList|url = http://www.rxlist.com/precedex-drug/clinical-pharmacology.htm|website = RxList|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}</ref>

Dexmedetomidine is metabolized by the liver via [[glucuronidation]] and [[cytochrome P450]]. As such, this drug should be used with caution in people with liver disease.<ref name="Keating 1119–1130">{{Cite journal|title = Dexmedetomidine: A Review of Its Use for Sedation in the Intensive Care Setting|journal = Drugs|date = 2015-07-01|issn = 0012-6667|pmid = 26063213|pages = 1119–1130|volume = 75|issue = 10|doi = 10.1007/s40265-015-0419-5|first = Gillian M.|last = Keating}}</ref>

The majority of metabolized dexmedetomidine is excreted in the urine ~95%.

== History ==
Dexmedetomidine was approved in 1999 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a short term sedative and analgesic (<24 hours) for critically ill or injured people on mechanical ventilation in the [[intensive care unit]] (ICU). The rationale for its use short term was due to concerns over withdrawal side effects, such as rebound high blood pressure. These withdrawal side effects have not been consistently observed in research studies, however.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Dexmedetomidine infusion for more than 24 hours in critically ill patients: sedative and cardiovascular effects|journal = Intensive Care Medicine|date = 2004-12-01|issn = 0342-4642|pmid = 15338124|pages = 2188–2196|volume = 30|issue = 12|doi = 10.1007/s00134-004-2417-z|first = Yahya|last = Shehabi|first2 = Urban|last2 = Ruettimann|first3 = Harriet|last3 = Adamson|first4 = Richard|last4 = Innes|first5 = Mathieu|last5 = Ickeringill}}</ref> More recently, in 2008 the FDA expanded its indication to include nonintubated people requiring sedation for surgical or non-surgical procedures, such as colonoscopy.
