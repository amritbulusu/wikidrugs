'''5F-ADB''' (also known as '''5F-MDMB-PINACA''') is an [[indazole]]-based synthetic [[cannabinoid]] from the indazole-3-carboxamide family, which has been used as an active ingredient in [[synthetic cannabis]] products and has been sold online as a [[designer drug]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://neorcs.com/5f-adb | title=5F-adb | publisher=Neorcs Chemical | accessdate=21 July 2016}}</ref><ref name="Shevyrin_2015">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shevyrin V, Melkozerov V, Nevero A, Eltsov O, Shafran Y, Morzherin Y, Lebedev AT | title = Identification and analytical characteristics of synthetic cannabinoids with an indazole-3-carboxamide structure bearing a N-1-methoxycarbonylalkyl group | journal = Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry | date = Apr 2015 | pmid = 25893797 | doi = 10.1007/s00216-015-8612-7 | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00216-015-8612-7 | volume=407 | pages=6301–15}}</ref> 5F-ADB is a potent [[agonist]] of the [[CB1 receptor|CB<sub>1</sub> receptor]],<ref>{{cite journal | author1=Samuel D Banister ||display-authors=etal | url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acschemneuro.5b00112 | title=The pharmacology of valinate and tert-leucinate synthetic cannabinoids 5F-AMBICA, 5F-AMB, 5F-ADB, AMB-FUBINACA, MDMB-FUBINACA, MDMB-CHMICA, and their analogues | date=July 2016 | journal=ACS Chemical Neuroscience | doi=10.1021/acschemneuro.6b00137 | pmid=27421060 | volume=7 | pages=1241–54}}</ref> though it is unclear whether it is selective for this target. 5F-ADB was first identified in November 2014 from [[post-mortem]] samples taken from an individual who had died after using a product containing this substance. Subsequent testing identified 5F-ADB to have been present in a total of ten people who had died from unexplained drug overdoses in Japan between September 2014 and December 2014, and it was added to the Japanese banned drug list in December 2014. 5F-ADB is believed to be extremely potent based on the very low levels detected in tissue samples, and appears to be significantly more toxic than earlier synthetic cannabinoid drugs that had previously been sold.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s11419-014-0259-0| title = Identification and quantitation of 5-fluoro-ADB, one of the most dangerous synthetic cannabinoids, in the stomach contents and solid tissues of a human cadaver and in some herbal products| journal = Forensic Toxicology| year = 2014| last1 = Hasegawa| first1 = Koutaro| last2 = Wurita| first2 = Amin| last3 = Minakata| first3 = Kayoko| last4 = Gonmori| first4 = Kunio| last5 = Yamagishi| first5 = Itaru| last6 = Nozawa| first6 = Hideki| last7 = Watanabe| first7 = Kanako| last8 = Suzuki| first8 = Osamu| volume=33| pages=112–121}}</ref>
