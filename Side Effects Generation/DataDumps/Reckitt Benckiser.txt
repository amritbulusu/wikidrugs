==Controversies==
===Deaths caused by humidifier disinfectant===
{{See also|Polyhexamethylene guanidine#South Korean lung disease outbreak and deaths}}
In 2001 Reckitt Benckiser acquired the Korean Oxy brand from [[OCI (company)|Oriental Chemical Industries]]. Since 1996, Oxy had been using [[polyhexamethylene guanidine]] (PHMG) in a humidifier steriliser product called Oxy Ssak Ssak. In 2011 the use of PHMG was dropped when the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) published a report showing a link between the compound and lung damage and deaths.<ref name=Sina>{{cite web |title=Oxy apologizes to S.Koreans for usage of toxic chemical in humidifier sterilizer |publisher=[[Sina (company)|Sina Corp]] |url=http://english.sina.com/news/2016-05-02/doc-ifxruaee5392597.shtml |date=2 May 2016|accessdate=2 May 2016}}</ref> Several other companies in South Korea made humidifier sterilisers with PHMG between 2001 and 2011.<ref name=BBCoxy/>

According to a ''[[BBC]]'' report in May 2016, about 500 people, many of them women and children, are reported to have died or been injured after inhaling PHMG.<ref name=BBCoxy/> According to a ''[[The Korea Herald]]'' report in April 2016, in 2015 750 disinfectant users had requested a test to determine if they had been harmed by the disinfectant and as of the date of that report, 221 had been confirmed and full results were expected to be released late in 2017.<ref name=KH>{{cite web|first=Lee |last=Hyun-jeong |work=The Korea Herald|date=24 April 2016|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160424000273 |title=Oxy suspected of watering down report|accessdate=2 May 2016}}</ref> A report on ''[[Sina.com]]'' in May 2016 said that PHMG was known to have caused 70 deaths and to harmed the lungs of 177 people, with the actual total of deaths and people injured unknown.<ref name=Sina/>

Sometime after the release of the KCDC report, prosecutors in South Korea opened an investigation into the companies selling the disinfectants, which increased its pace in January 2016.<ref name=KH/> Reckitt Benckiser Korea submitted a toxicity report on PHMG to prosecutors in January 2016; prosecutors were also investigating allegations that the company suppressed data showing PHMG to be toxic in the report it had submitted.<ref name=KH/> In April 2016 a coalition of consumer groups called for a boycott of the company.<ref name=KTboy>{{cite web|first=Lee |last=Kyung-min |work=The Korea Times|date= 25 April 2016 |url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/04/116_203380.html |title=Consumers to boycott Oxy Reckitt Benckiser|accessdate=25 April 2016}}</ref>

===Anti-competitive behaviour===
In 2008 the BBC's ''[[Newsnight]]'' accused Reckitt Benckiser of attempting to delay the introduction of a competitive, generic version of one of its most popular products, [[Gaviscon]], a treatment for [[heartburn]] and [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]]. In his introduction, reporter Martin Shankleman said, "Gaviscon is hailed as a power brand by its owners, Reckitt Benckiser". He continued, "Reckitt Benckiser likes to claim that the profits flow from their expertise in marketing. But we know that there's another way in which they've been coining it in—-by ripping-off the [[National Health Service|NHS]], as a whistle-blower has told us. The "whistle-blower" was shown in silhouette, and his words were spoken by an actor: "Reckitt's cheated the National Health Service. It could have saved the NHS millions of pounds. But not just the NHS, patients, doctors—they've cheated health professionals. I felt it had to be exposed". ''Newsnight'' claimed that RB had a "secret plan to ensure that it kept its stranglehold" after the Gaviscon patent expired in 1999, and that ''Newsnight'' had seen the plan. The [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] asked ''Newsnight'' to hand its documents to the NHS counter-fraud service.<ref name="NewsnightVideo">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_7280000/newsid_7284600/7284696.stm?bw=bb&mp=wm&news=1&ms3=6&ms_javascript=true&bbcws=2|title=Gaviscon maker 'cheated the NHS' (video report)|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 April 2009 | date=8 March 2008}}</ref><ref name="NewsnightReport">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7282627.stm |title=Gaviscon maker 'cheated the NHS' |publisher=BBC |accessdate=13 April 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5g0YX6RFr?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7282627.stm |archivedate=13 April 2009 |date=7 March 2008 |first=Meirion |last=Jones |authorlink=Meirion Jones |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>

In response to the ''Newsnight'' report and the reports in the press, RB issued a statement that began:
{{quote|We are shocked by the allegations made as Reckitt Benckiser is a responsible company in the way it conducts its business.

Nevertheless, we are deeply concerned by the inappropriate sentiment expressed in some of the historic internal correspondence reported. We take this very seriously and have instigated an immediate internal investigation, and will take action. We also refute much of what has been reported which implies a power and influence we simply do not possess.

The company has never objected to a monograph driven generic name being published. The timetable of which is not, and never has been, within our control a monograph/generic name could have been published at any time by the regulators without reference to any third party.

The company made appropriate challenges where it felt it was justified in order to ensure patients are prescribed the right treatment. These were within the law and relevant regulations. We stress that the regulators only take a comment into account when it is valid.<ref name="ReckittStatement">{{cite web|url=http://www.reckittbenckiser.com/site/RKBR/Templates/MediaLatestNewsItem.aspx?pageid=414 |title=Statement in response to media reports about Gaviscon |last=Reckit Benckiser |date=7 March 2008 |publisher=Reckitt Benckiser Corporate Communications |accessdate=13 April 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5g0ilNBYE?url=http://www.reckittbenckiser.com/site/RKBR/Templates/MediaLatestNewsItem.aspx?pageid=414 |archivedate=13 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>}}

On 15 October 2010, RB was fined £10.2&nbsp;million by the [[Office of Fair Trading]] after the company admitted anti-competitive behaviour.<ref name="htanna">{{Cite news|title=Reckitt Benckiser fined £10.2m by OFT|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/oct/15/reckitt-benckiser-fined-oft-gaviscon|accessdate=15 October 2010|newspaper=The Guardian|date=15 October 2010 | location=London | first=Julia | last=Kollewe}}</ref>

In 2014 the [[Autorité de la concurrence]] in France found that RB had colluded with 12 other multinational companies (Colgate-Palmolive, Henkel, Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Sara Lee, SC Johnson and Bolton Solitaire, Laboratoires Vendôme, Gillette, L'Oreal, Beiersdorf and Vania) to [[price fixing|fix the prices]] of popular personal hygiene products; the fine of around €950&nbsp;million was the largest ever imposed by the agency.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.connexionfrance.com/court-appeal-price-fixing-fine-upheld-consumer-companies-gillette-loreal-procter-gamble-sc-johnson-18567-view-article.html |title=Huge price-fixing fine is upheld |work=The Connexion |date=28 October 2016|accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref>

===Legal challenges to rodenticide regulations===
In 2008 the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) announced a decision to remove second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides from store shelves, leaving the products available for purchase only by US licensed applicators.  The ruling was slated to go into effect in 2011 allowing poison companies time to adjust to the new law.  EPA's decision was based on tens of thousands of reports of pet, wildlife and child poisonings that resulted annually from rat poisons in the US alone.  In 2011, Reckitt Benckiser makers of [[d-CON]] products initiated a legal challenge to the EPA expected to take several years to resolve.   Early in 2014, California State Department of Pesticide Regulation ruled that anticoagulant rat poison sales would be restricted beginning on 1 July 2014.  RB filed suit in San Diego County Superior Court in April 2014 to block the decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_25461592/makers-rat-poison-d-con-sue-state|title=Makers of rat poison d-Con sue California|work=San Jose Mercury News|accessdate=21 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/campaigns/pesticides_reduction/rodenticides/pdfs/PetitionForWritOfMandate_03-31-2014.pdf|title=Petition for writ of Mandate|publisher=Superior Court|accessdate=21 March 2015}}</ref>

=== Palm oil procurement===
According to a 2016 [[Amnesty International]] report, Reckitt Benckiser is one of several consumer companies that buy palm oil from [[Wilmar International]], the world's largest palm oil refiner.  Amnesty found that Wilmer profits from [[child labour]] and [[forced labour]] and exposes workers to toxic banned chemicals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa21/5184/2016/en/ |title=The Great Palm Oil Scandal: Labour Abuses Behind Big Brand Names|publisher= Amnesty International |date=30 November 2016|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref>
