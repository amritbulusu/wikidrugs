'''Naltrexone''' is a [[pharmaceutical drug|medication]] that [[opioid antagonist|stops the activity of opioids]]. It is primarily used in the management of [[alcohol dependence]] and [[opioid dependence]].<ref name="GanellinTriggle1996">{{cite book|author1=C.R. Ganellin|author2=David J. Triggle|title=Dictionary of Pharmacological Agents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0THacd46ZsC&pg=PA1396|date=21 November 1996|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-412-46630-4|pages=1396–}}</ref>

The closely related medication, [[methylnaltrexone]], is used to treat opioid-induced constipation but does not treat addiction as it does not cross the [[blood brain barrier]]. [[Nalmefene]] is similar to naltrexone and is used for the same purposes as naltrexone. Naltrexone should not be confused with [[naloxone]], which is used in emergency cases of opioid [[overdose]].

Naltrexone is marketed under the trade name '''Revia''' and '''Vivitrol'''. In the United States as of 2016, naltrexone tablets cost about US$0.91 [[defined daily dose|per day]].<ref name=Medi2016/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/?code=N07BB04|title=Naltrexone|website=ATC/DDD Index|publisher=WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology|access-date=11 July 2016|quote="DDD ... 50 mg"}}</ref> The extended-release injections cost about $1,248.50 per month ($41.62 per day).<ref name=Medi2016>{{cite web|title=NADAC as of 2016-10-12 {{!}} Data.Medicaid.gov|url=https://data.medicaid.gov/Drug-Prices/NADAC-as-of-2016-10-12/eaa7-2n67|website=Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|accessdate=12 October 2016}}</ref> Naltrexone is also used in formulation with [[bupropion]] ([[bupropion/naltrexone]]) to treat [[obesity]] in the United States.

==Medical uses==

===Alcoholism===

The Sinclair method is a method of using opiate antagonists such as naltrexone to treat alcoholism. The patient takes the medication about an hour (and only then) before drinking to avoid side effects that arise from chronic use.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Kenneth|title=Drink Your Way Sober with Naltrexone|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/overcoming-addiction/201307/drink-your-way-sober-naltrexone|website=Psychology Today|accessdate=18 July 2016|date=Jul 28, 2013}}</ref><ref name=Sin2001>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/alcalc/36.1.2 |pmid=11139409 |title=Evidence about the use of naltrexone and for different ways of using it in the treatment of alcoholism |journal=Alcohol and Alcoholism |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=2–10 |year=2001 |last1=Sinclair |first1=J. D. }}</ref> The opioid antagonist blocks the positive reinforcement effects of alcohol and allows the person to stop or reduce drinking.<ref name=Sin2001/>

===Opioid use ===
Naltrexone helps patients overcome [[opioid addiction]] by blocking the effects of opioid drugs.  It has little effect on opioid cravings.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1369-1600.2007.00067.x |pmid=17508990 |title=Does naltrexone affect craving in abstinent opioid-dependent patients? |journal=Addiction Biology |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=176–82 |year=2007 |last1=Dijkstra |first1=Boukje A.

A 2011 review of studies suggested that naltrexone, when taken by mouth, was not superior to placebo or to no medication, nor was it superior to [[benzodiazepine]] or [[buprenorphine]].  Because of the poor quality of the reviewed studies, the authors found insufficient evidence to support naltrexone therapy when taken by mouth for an opioid use disorder.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001333.pub4 |pmid=21491383 |title=Oral naltrexone maintenance treatment for opioid dependence |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=4 |pages=CD001333 |year=2011 |last1=Minozzi |first1=Silvia |last2=Amato |first2=Laura |last3=Vecchi |first3=Simona |last4=Davoli |first4=Marina |last5=Kirchmayer |first5=Ursula |last6=Verster |first6=Annette }}</ref>  While some patients do well with the oral formulation, it must be taken daily, and a patient whose cravings become overwhelming can obtain opioid intoxication simply by skipping a dose. Due to this issue, the usefulness of oral naltrexone in opioid use disorders is limited by the low retention in treatment.  Oral naltrexone remains an ideal treatment only for a small part of the opioid-addicted population, usually those with a stable social situation and motivation. With additional [[contingency management]] support, naltrexone is effective in a broader population.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2006.01369.x |pmid=16548929 |title=Efficacy of maintenance treatment with naltrexone for opioid dependence: A meta-analytical review |journal=Addiction |volume=101 |issue=4 |pages=491–503 |year=2006 |last1=Johansson |first1=Björn Axel |last2=Berglund |first2=Mats |last3=Lindgren |first3=Anna }}</ref>

Extended-release [[Injection (medicine)#Depot injection|depot injections]] of naltrexone, administered once per month, have proven somewhat effective in treating opioid abuse, an approach that avoids the [[Compliance (medicine)|compliance]] issue that arises with oral formulations.<ref name="ComerSullivan2006">{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.63.2.210 |pmid=16461865 |pmc=4200530 |title=Injectable, Sustained-Release Naltrexone for the Treatment of Opioid Dependence |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=210–8 |year=2006 |last1=Comer |first1=Sandra D. |last2=Sullivan |first2=Maria A. |last3=Yu |first3=Elmer |last4=Rothenberg |first4=Jami L. |last5=Kleber |first5=Herbert D. |last6=Kampman |first6=Kyle |last7=Dackis |first7=Charles |last8=o'Brien |first8=Charles P. }}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
The most common side effects reported with naltrexone are [[gastrointestinal]] complaints such as [[diarrhea]] and abdominal cramping. These adverse effects are analogous to the symptoms of [[opioid withdrawal]], as the mu receptor blockade will increase GI motility.

Naltrexone has been reported to cause liver damage (when given at doses higher than recommended).  It carries an FDA boxed warning for this rare side effect.  Due to these reports, some physicians may check liver function tests prior to starting naltrexone, and periodically thereafter.  Concerns for liver toxicity initially arose from a study of non-addicted obese patients receiving 300&nbsp;mg of naltrexone.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=3092099 |url=https://archives.drugabuse.gov/pdf/monographs/download67.html |year=1986 |author1=Pfohl |first1=David N. |title=Naltrexone hydrochloride (Trexan): A review of serum transaminase elevations at high dosage |journal=NIDA research monograph |volume=67 |pages=66–72 |last2=Allen |first2=John I. |last3=Atkinson |first3=Richard L. |last4=Knopman |first4=David S. |last5=Malcolm |first5=Robert J. |last6=Mitchell |first6=James E. |last7=Morley |first7=John E. }}</ref> Subsequent studies have suggested limited toxicity in other patient populations.

Naltrexone should not be started until several (typically 7-10) days of abstinence from opioids has been achieved.  This is due to the risk of acute opioid withdrawal if naltrexone is taken, as naltrexone will displace most opioids from their receptors.  The time of abstinence may be shorter than 7 days, depending on the half-life of the specific opioid taken.  Some physicians use a naloxone challenge to determine whether an individual has any opioids remaining.  The challenge involves giving a test dose of naloxone and monitoring for opioid withdrawal.  If withdrawal occurs, naltrexone should not be started.<ref name=galanter />

==Contraindications==
Naltrexone should not be used by persons with acute hepatitis or liver failure, or those with recent opioid use (typically 7–10 days).

==Pharmacogenetics==
A naltrexone treatment study by Anton et al., released by the [[National Institutes of Health]] in February 2008 and published in the ''[[Archives of General Psychiatry]],'' has shown that alcoholics having a certain variant of the opioid receptor gene (G polymorphism of [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]] Rs1799971 in the gene [[OPRM1]]), known as Asp40, demonstrated strong response to naltrexone and were far more likely to experience success at cutting back or discontinuing their alcohol intake altogether, while for those lacking the gene variant, naltrexone appeared to be no different from placebo.<ref name="ctidNCT00006206">{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.65.2.135 |pmid=18250251 |pmc=2666924 |title=An Evaluation of μ-Opioid Receptor (OPRM1) as a Predictor of Naltrexone Response in the Treatment of Alcohol Dependence |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=135–44 |year=2008 |last1=Anton |first1=Raymond F. |last2=Oroszi |first2=Gabor |last3=o'Malley |first3=Stephanie |last4=Couper |first4=David |last5=Swift |first5=Robert |last6=Pettinati |first6=Helen |last7=Goldman |first7=David }}</ref> The G allele of OPRM1 is most common in individuals of Asian descent, with 60% to 70% of people of Chinese, Japanese, and Indian ancestry having at least one copy, as opposed to 30% of Europeans and few Africans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs1799971|title=Rs1799971 (SNPedia)}}</ref>

Because of the characteristics of the patient group in the US, the first study was done on white patients and the next without regard for ethnicity. Anton et al. found that patients of African descent did not have much success with naltrexone in treatment for alcohol dependence because of lacking the relevant gene.<ref name="ctidNCT00006206"/>

As white patients with the gene had a five times greater rate of success in reducing drinking when given naltrexone than did patients without the gene, when used in a protocol of [[Medical Management]] (MM), Anton et al. concluded, 
<blockquote>"Because almost 25% of the treatment-seeking population carries the Asp40 allele, genetic testing of individuals before naltrexone treatment might be worth the cost and effort, especially if structured behavioral treatment were not being considered."<ref name="ctidNCT00006206"/> This would enable treatment to be targeted by genetics to patients for whom it would be most effective. They noted, "Naltrexone is relatively easy to administer and free of serious adverse effects and, as we observed in the Asp40 carriers we studied, it appears to be highly effective."<ref name="ctidNCT00006206"/></blockquote>

Studies have found naltrexone to be more efficacious among certain white subjects, because of the genetic basis, than among black subjects, who generally do not carry the relevant gene variant.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.2001.tb02356.x |pmid=11584154 |title=Efficacy of Naltrexone and Acamprosate for Alcoholism Treatment: A Meta-Analysis |journal=Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research |volume=25 |issue=9 |pages=1335–41 |year=2001 |last1=Kranzler |first1=Henry R. |last2=Kirk |first2=Jeffrey }}</ref> A 2009 study of naltrexone as an alcohol dependence treatment among African Americans failed to find any statistically significant differences between naltrexone and a placebo.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2009.07.006 |pmid=19717248 |pmc=3409877 |title=Naltrexone for the treatment of alcohol dependence among African Americans: Results from the COMBINE Study |journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence |volume=105 |issue=3 |pages=256–8 |year=2009 |last1=Ray |first1=Lara A. |last2=Oslin |first2=David W. }}</ref> Studies have suggested that carriers of the G allele may experience higher levels of craving and stronger "high" upon alcohol consumption, compared to carriers of the dominant allele, and naltrexone somewhat blunts these responses, leading to a reduction in alcohol use in some studies.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.2011.01633.x |pmid=21895723 |pmc=3249007 |title=The Role of the Asn40Asp Polymorphism of the Mu Opioid Receptor Gene (OPRM1) on Alcoholism Etiology and Treatment: A Critical Review |journal=Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=385–94 |year=2012 |last1=Ray |first1=Lara A. |last2=Barr |first2=Christina S. |last3=Blendy |first3=Julie A. |last4=Oslin |first4=David |last5=Goldman |first5=David |last6=Anton |first6=Raymond F. }}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Naltrexone and its [[active metabolite]] [[6β-naltrexol]] are [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]]s at the [[μ-opioid receptor]] (MOR), the [[κ-opioid receptor]] (KOR) to a lesser extent, and to a far lesser and possibly insignificant extent, at the [[δ-opioid receptor]] (DOR).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s40263-013-0096-4 |pmid=23881605 |pmc=4600601 |title=Targeted Opioid Receptor Antagonists in the Treatment of Alcohol Use Disorders |journal=CNS Drugs |volume=27 |issue=10 |pages=777–87 |year=2013 |last1=Niciu |first1=Mark J. |last2=Arias |first2=Albert J. }}</ref> The K<sub>i</sub> [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] values of naltrexone at the MOR, KOR, and DOR have been reported as 0.0825 nM, 0.509 nM, and 8.02 nM, respectively, demonstrating a MOR/KOR binding ratio of 6.17 and a MOR/DOR binding ratio of 97.2.<ref name="pmid7562497">{{cite journal |pmid=7562497 |url=http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/274/3/1263.short |year=1995 |author1=Codd |first1=E.

The blockade of [[opioid receptor]]s is the basis behind naltrexone's action in the management of opioid dependence&mdash;it reversibly blocks or attenuates the effects of opioids. Its mechanism of action in alcohol dependence is not fully understood, but as an opioid receptor antagonist is likely to be due to the modulation of the [[dopaminergic]] [[mesolimbic pathway]] (one of the primary centers for risk-reward analysis in the brain, and a tertiary "pleasure center") which is hypothesized to be a major center of the reward associated with addiction that all major drugs of abuse are believed to activate. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Mechanism of action may be antagonism to endogenous opioids such as [[tetrahydropapaveroline]], whose production is augmented in the presence of alcohol.<ref name="HaberRoske1996">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0024-3205(96)00597-8 |pmid=9000113 |title=Alcohol induces formation of morphine precursors in the striatum of rats |journal=Life Sciences |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=79–89 |year=1996 |last1=Haber |first1=Hanka |last2=Roske |first2=Irmgard |last3=Rottmann |first3=Matthias |last4=Georgi |first4=Monika |last5=Melzig |first5=Matthias F. }}</ref>

==Structure and pharmacokinetics==
Naltrexone can be described as a substituted [[oxymorphone]] &ndash; here the [[tertiary amine]] [[methyl]]-substituent is replaced with [[methylcyclopropane]].  Naltrexone is the N-cyclopropylmethyl derivative of oxymorphone.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Naltrexone is metabolized mainly to [[6β-naltrexol]] by the liver enzyme [[dihydrodiol dehydrogenase]].  Other metabolites include 2-hydroxy-3-methoxy-6β-naltrexol and 2-hydroxy-3-methoxy-naltrexone. These are then further metabolized by conjugation with glucuronide.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The plasma [[Biological half-life|half-life]] of naltrexone and its metabolite 6β-naltrexol are about 4 hours and 13 hours, respectively.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

An 2011 article reported that this single trial of naltrexone was performed not by comparing it to the best available, evidence-based treatment (methadone or buprenorphine) but by comparing it with a placebo.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61333-0 |title=Injectable extended-release naltrexone for opioid dependence – Authors' reply |journal=The Lancet |volume=378 |issue=9792 |pages=666 |year=2011 |last1=Wolfe |first1=Daniel |last2=Carrieri |first2=MP |last3=Dasgupta |first3=Nabarun |last4=Bruce |first4=Douglas |last5=Wodak |first5=Alex }}</ref> In addition, the study failed to follow up on participants to document post-treatment overdose - a key measure for opioid substitution therapies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.med.upenn.edu/psych/documents/ADAW_050911.pdf |format=PDF |title=Alcoholism Drug Abuse Weekly |date=May 9, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219014408/https://www.med.upenn.edu/psych/documents/ADAW_050911.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-02-19}}</ref> Furthermore, by 2011, Vivitrol cost about $1,100 a month, compared to $11 a month for generic naltrexone. A second 2011 article argued that these factors led to criticism of the study's design and ethics, and, by  extension, of the FDA's approval of injectable naltrexone for opioid addiction based on this study.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)62056-9 |title=Concerns about injectable naltrexone for opioid dependence |pmid=21529930 |journal=The Lancet |volume=377 |issue=9776 |pages=1468–70 |year=2011 |last1=Wolfe |first1=Daniel |last2=Carrieri |first2=M Patrizia |last3=Dasgupta |first3=Nabarun |last4=Wodak |first4=Alex |last5=Newman |first5=Robert |last6=Bruce |first6=R Douglas }}</ref>

===Tom Price's remarks 2017=== 
In May 2017, [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services]] [[Tom Price (American politician)|Tom Price]], praised [vivitrol] as the future of opioid addiction treatment after visiting the company’s plant in Ohio.<ref name="NYT_2017_Vivitrol"/> His remarks set off sharp criticism with almost 700 experts in the field of substance abuse submitting a letter to Price cautioning him about Vivitrol's "marketing tactics" and warning him that his comment "ignore widely accepted science".<ref name="Tom-Price-Letter-Re-MAT_2017">{{cite web |url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3723472-Tom-Price-Letter-Re-MAT.html |title=Letter to Tom Price |date=May 2017 |access-date=June 11, 2017}}</ref> The experts pointed out that Vivitrol's competitors, [[buprenorphine]] and [[methadone]], are "less expensive", "more widely used" and have been "rigorously studied".

Price had claimed that buprenorphine and methadone were "simply substitute"s for "illicit drugs"<ref name="NYT_2017_Vivitrol">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/11/health/vivitrol-drug-opioid-addiction.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 11, 2017 |access-date=June 11, 2017 |title=Seizing on Opioid Crisis, a Drug Maker Lobbies Hard for Its Product |quote="Advertising for Vivitrol on a subway car in Brooklyn last month. Marketing for the drug has shifted into high gear." |first1=Abby |last1=Goodnough |first2=Kate |last2=Zernike}}</ref> whereas according to the letter, "the substantial body of research evidence supporting these treatments is summarized in guidance from within your own agency, including the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the US Surgeon General, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To briefly summarize, buprenorphine and methadone have been demonstrated to be highly effective in managing the core symptoms of opioid use disorder, reducing the risk of relapse and fatal overdose, and encouraging long-term recovery."<ref name="Tom-Price-Letter-Re-MAT_2017" />

According to a June 11, 2017 [[The New York Times]] article, [[Alkermes (company)|Alkermes]] "has spent years coaxing, with a deft lobbying strategy that has targeted lawmakers and law enforcement officials. The company has spent millions of dollars on contributions to officials struggling to stem the epidemic of opioid abuse. It has also provided thousands of free doses to encourage the use of Vivitrol in jails and prisons, which have by default become major detox centers".<ref name="NYT_2017_Vivitrol" />

===Depersonalization/derealization===
Naltrexone is sometimes used in the treatment of [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociative]] symptoms such as [[depersonalization]] and [[derealization]].<ref name="SimeonAbugel2008">{{cite book|author1=Daphne Simeon|author2=Jeffrey Abugel|title=Feeling Unreal: Depersonalization Disorder and the Loss of the Self|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ONLyq-mVLuIC&pg=PA166|date=10 October 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-976635-2|pages=166–}}</ref><ref name="PhDPhD2014">{{cite book|author1=Ulrich F.

===Low-dose naltrexone===
{{Main article|Low-dose naltrexone}}
"Low-dose naltrexone" (LDN) describes the "[[Off-label use|off-label]]" use of naltrexone at low doses for diseases not related to chemical dependency or intoxication, such as [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref name=Novella/> More research needs to be done before it can be recommended for clinical use.

Although there are scientific studies showing its efficacy in some conditions such as [[fibromyalgia]],<ref name=ldntxfm>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1526-4637.2009.00613.x |pmid=19453963 |pmc=2891387 |title=Fibromyalgia Symptoms Are Reduced by Low-Dose Naltrexone: A Pilot Study |journal=Pain Medicine |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=663–72 |year=2009 |last1=Younger |first1=Jarred |last2=MacKey |first2=Sean }}</ref> other, more dramatic claims for its use in conditions like [[cancer]] and [[HIV]] have less scientific support.<ref name=Novella>{{cite web|last=Novella|first=Steven|title=Low Dose Naltrexone – Bogus or Cutting Edge Science?|url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/low-dose-naltrexone-bogus-or-cutting-edge-science/ |date=5 May 2010 |accessdate=5 July 2011 |work=Science-Based Medicine}}</ref> This treatment has received significant attention on the [[Internet]], especially through websites run by organizations promoting its use.<ref name=NMSS>{{cite web|last=Bowling|first=Allen C.|title=Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) The "411" on LDN|url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/multimedia-library/momentum-magazine/back-issues/momentum-spring-09/index.aspx|publisher=National Multiple Sclerosis Society|accessdate=6 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222063116/http://www.nationalmssociety.org/multimedia-library/momentum-magazine/back-issues/momentum-spring-09/index.aspx|archivedate=22 December 2011|df=}}</ref>

===Tobacco dependence===
A study done by The Chicago Stop Smoking Research Project at the [[University of Chicago]] found that naltrexone did not help to improve a subject's chance of attaining [[smoking cessation]] when compared to a [[placebo]].<ref name="doi10.1080/14622200600789767">{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/14622200600789767 |pmid=17008194 |title=Efficacy of naltrexone in smoking cessation: A preliminary study and an examination of sex differences |journal=Nicotine & Tobacco Research |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=671–82 |year=2006 |last1=King |first1=Andrea |last2=De Wit |first2=Harriet |last3=Riley |first3=Roslynn |last4=Cao |first4=Dingcai |last5=Niaura |first5=Raymond |last6=Hatsukami |first6=Dorothy }}</ref>

===Self-injurious behaviors===
Some studies suggest that [[self-injury|self-injurious behaviors]] present in persons with developmental disabilities (including autism) can sometimes be remedied with naltrexone.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02684958 |title=Effects of naltrexone on self-injury, stereotypy, and social behavior of adults with developmental disabilities |journal=Journal of Developmental and Physical Disabilities |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=137–46 |year=1995 |last1=Smith |first1=Stanley G. |last2=Gupta |first2=Krishan K. |last3=Smith |first3=Sylvia H. }}</ref>
In these cases, it is believed that the self-injury is being done to release [[beta-endorphin]], which binds to the same receptors as heroin and morphine.<ref>{{cite news | publisher=The Reporter | last=Manley | first=Cynthia | date=1998-03-20 | url=http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/reporter/index.html?ID=461 | title=Self-injuries may have biochemical base: study }}</ref> If the "rush" generated by self-injury is removed, the behavior may stop.

===Behavioral disorders===
There are indications that naltrexone might be beneficial in the treatment of impulse control disorders such as [[kleptomania]], compulsive gambling, or [[trichotillomania]] (compulsive hair pulling), but there is conflicting evidence of its effectiveness for gambling.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2008.11.022 |pmid=19217077 |laysummary=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090401101900.htm |laysource=Science Daily |laydate=April 3, 2009 |title=A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of the Opiate Antagonist, Naltrexone, in the Treatment of Kleptomania |journal=Biological Psychiatry |volume=65 |issue=7 |pages=600–6 |year=2009 |last1=Grant |first1=Jon E. |last2=Kim |first2=Suck Won |last3=Odlaug |first3=Brian L. }}</ref><ref name=gambling>{{cite web|url=http://ichgcp.net/clinical-trials-registry/NCT00326807|title=A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Naltrexone in the Treatment of Concurrent Alcohol Dependence and Pathological Gambling - ICH GCP - Clinical Trials Registry|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0006-3223(01)01079-4 |pmid=11377409 |title=Double-blind naltrexone and placebo comparison study in the treatment of pathological gambling |journal=Biological Psychiatry |volume=49 |issue=11 |pages=914–21 |year=2001 |last1=Kim |first1=Suck Won |last2=Grant |first2=Jon E |last3=Adson |first3=David E |last4=Shin |first4=Young Chul }}</ref> A 2008 case study reported successful use of naltrexone in suppressing and treating an internet [[pornography addiction]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.4065/83.2.226 |pmid=18241634 |title=Internet Sex Addiction Treated with Naltrexone |journal=Mayo Clinic Proceedings |volume=83 |issue=2 |pages=226–30 |year=2008 |last1=Bostwick |first1=J.

===Countering adverse effects of interferon alpha===
Naltrexone is effective in suppressing the [[cytokine]]-mediated adverse neuropsychiatric effects of [[interferon alpha]] therapy.<ref name="pmid16142050">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/s0013-7006(05)82400-5 |id={{INIST|16920336}} |pmid=16142050 |title=Hépatite C, Interféron α et dépression : Principales hypothèses physiopathologiques |trans_title=Hepatitis C, interferon a and depression: main physiopathologic hypothesis |language=French |journal=L'Encéphale |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=349–57 |year=2005 |last1=Vignau |first1=J. |last2=Karila |first2=L. |last3=Costisella |first3=O. |last4=Canva |first4=V. }}</ref><ref name="pmid17068950">{{cite journal |pmid=17068950 |url=http://www.psychiatriapsychoterapia.pl/?a=articles_show&id=459 |year=2006 |author1=Małyszczak |first1=Krzysztof |title=Objawy neuropsychiatryczne w trakcie leczenia interferonem alfa |trans_title=Neuropsychiatric symptoms related to interferon alpha |language=Polish |journal=Psychiatria polska |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=787–97 |last2=Inglot |first2=Małgorzata |last3=Pawłowski |first3=Tomasz |last4=Czarnecki |first4=Marcin |last5=Rymer |first5=Weronika |last6=Kiejna |first6=Andrzej }}</ref>
