'''Sitagliptin''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]; {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Sitagliptin.ogg|s|ɪ|t|ə|ˈ|g|l|ɪ|p|t|ɪ|n}}, previously identified as '''MK-0431''' and marketed as the [[phosphate]] salt under the trade name '''Januvia''') is an oral antihyperglycemic ([[antidiabetic drug]]) of the [[DPP-4 inhibitors|dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor]] class.  It was developed, and is marketed, by [[Merck & Co.]] This enzyme-inhibiting drug is used either alone or in combination with other oral antihyperglycemic agents (such as [[metformin]] or a [[thiazolidinedione]]) for treatment of [[diabetes mellitus type 2]].<ref name=medupdate01>{{cite web |title=Sitagliptin for Type 2 Diabetes |author=National Prescribing Service |date=August 2010 |accessdate=27 August 2010 |url=http://www.nps.org.au/consumers/publications/medicine_update/issues/sitagliptin}}</ref>

The existence of rare case reports of renal failure and hypersensitivity reactions is noted in the United States prescribing information, but a causative role for sitagliptin has not been established.<ref name=PrescribeInfo>{{cite web |url=https://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/j/januvia/januvia_pi.pdf |title=www.merck.com |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Several [[postmarketing surveillance|postmarketing reports]] of [[pancreatitis]] (some fatal) have been made in people treated with sitagliptin and other DPP-4 inhibitors,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Olansky L |title=Do incretin-based therapies cause acute pancreatitis? |journal=J Diabetes Sci Technol |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=228–9 |year=2010 |pmid=20167189 |pmc=2825646 |doi=10.1177/193229681000400129}}</ref> and the U.S. package insert carries a warning to this effect,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.januvia.com/sitagliptin/januvia/consumer/type-2-diabetes-medicine/index.jsp?WT.svl=2?src=1&WT.srch=1&WT.mc_id=JA80G |title=Januvia for type 2 diabetes |publisher=Merck & Co. |accessdate=2010-07-31}}</ref> although the causal link between sitagliptin and pancreatitis has not yet been fully substantiated.<ref name=medupdate01 />  One study with lab rats published in 2009 concluded that some of the possible risks of pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer may be reduced when it is used with metformin. However, while DPP-4 inhibitors showed an increase in such risk factors, as of 2009, no increase in pancreatic cancer has been reported in individuals taking DPP-4 inhibitors.<ref>Aleksey V.

The updated (August 2015) prescribing information cautions that multiple [[Postmarketing surveillance|postmarketing reports]] have been made of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients receiving sitagliptin. Merck notes:

{{quote|Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of JANUVIA as monotherapy and/or in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, cutaneous vasculitis, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome; hepatic enzyme elevations; acute pancreatitis, including fatal and nonfatal hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis; worsening renal function, including acute renal failure (sometimes requiring dialysis); severe and disabling arthralgia; constipation; vomiting; headache; myalgia; pain in extremity; back pain; pruritus; pemphigoid.<ref name=PrescribeInfo/>}}

In 2015, FDA added a new Warning and Precaution about the risk of "severe and disabling" joint pain to the labels of all DPP-4 Inhibitor medicines.<ref>{{cite web|title=DPP-4 Inhibitors for Type 2 Diabetes: Drug Safety Communication—May Cause Severe Joint Pain|url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm460238.htm|website=FDA|accessdate=1 September 2015|date=2015-08-28}}</ref> In addition to sitagliptin, other DPP-4 inhibitors such as saxagliptin, linagliptin, and alogliptin must also carry the new FDA Warning and Precaution label.

==Mechanism of action==
{{see also|Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors}}
Sitagliptin works to [[competitive inhibition|competitively inhibit]] the [[enzyme]] dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4). This enzyme breaks down the [[incretin]]s [[GLP-1]] and GIP, [[gastrointestinal hormone]]s released in response to a meal.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Herman G, Bergman A, Liu F, Stevens C, Wang A, Zeng W, Chen L, Snyder K, Hilliard D, Tanen M, Tanaka W, Meehan A, Lasseter K, Dilzer S, Blum R, Wagner J | title = Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of the oral DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin in middle-aged obese subjects. | journal = J Clin Pharmacol | volume = 46 | issue = 8 | pages = 876–86 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16855072 | doi = 10.1177/0091270006289850}}</ref> By preventing GLP-1 and GIP inactivation, they are able to increase the secretion of insulin and suppress the release of glucagon by the alpha cells of the pancreas. This drives blood glucose levels towards normal.  As the blood glucose level approaches normal, the amounts of insulin released and glucagon suppressed diminishes, thus tending to prevent an "overshoot" and subsequent low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) which is seen with some other oral hypoglycemic agents.

Sitagliptin has been shown to lower [[HbA1c]] level by about 0.7% points versus placebo. It is slightly less effective than metformin when used as a [[monotherapy]]. It does not cause weight gain and has less hypoglycemia compared to [[sulfonylureas]]. Sitagliptin is recommended as a second line drug (in combination with other drugs) after the combination of diet/exercise and metformin fails.<ref name=Gadsby2009>{{cite journal|last=Gadsby|first=Roger|title=Efﬁcacy and Safety of Sitagliptin in the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes|journal=Clinical Medicine: Therapeutics|year=2009|issue=1|pages=53–62|url=http://www.la-press.com/redirect_file.php?fileId=1919&filename=CMT-1-Gadsby&fileType=pdf|format=pdf}}</ref>
