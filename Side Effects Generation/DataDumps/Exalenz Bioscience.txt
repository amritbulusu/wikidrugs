'''Exalenz Bioscience Ltd.''' is a [[biotechnology]] company that develops and manufactures non-invasive diagnostic medical devices for gastrointestinal and liver conditions.  The company’s technology uses a continuous flow of a patient’s breath to diagnose illness. Exalenz is headquartered in [[Modiin|Modi’in]], [[Israel]] and is publicly traded on the [[Tel Aviv Stock Exchange]] as EXEN. U.S. headquarters are in [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], [[New Jersey]].

Exalenz’s devices use real time [[breath gas analysis]] to detect the ratio between different carbon dioxide isotopes - <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> and <sup>12</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>.  The detection technology is termed Molecular Correlation Spectroscopy (MCS). Laser-like light sources emit infrared beams in the [[absorption spectrum]] for CO<sub>2</sub> only. This absorption is measured. MCS is extremely sensitive and can work with smaller sample cells and a lower breath flow rate than other breath methods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capnography.com/Physics/Physicsphysical.htm |title=Physics of capnography |publisher=Capnography.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Ehrenwerth, Jan M.D., and James B.

Exalenz’s BreathID, a first generation device, received an [[CE marking|EU CE Mark]] on March 18, 2002, and the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) on July 9, 2001. A second generation product, BreathID Hp Breath Test System, received an EU CE Mark on April 18, 2013 and FDA clearance on May 22, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000846705&fid=1725 |title=FDA approves new Exalenz H.

It takes days to get results from either test. The BreathID Hp test takes 10–15 minutes. Physicians receive results at the end of the test.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/07/15/us-exalenz-hpylori-test-idUKBRE96E0CA20130715 |title=Exalenz launches new breath test to detect H. pylori bacteria &#124; Reuters |publisher=Reuters |date=2013-07-15 |accessdate=2013-11-08}}</ref>
