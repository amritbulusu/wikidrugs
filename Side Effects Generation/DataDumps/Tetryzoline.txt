'''Tetryzoline''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]];<ref>{{cite web|title=International Non-Proprietary Names for Pharmaceutical Preparations.

Other derivatives include [[naphazoline]], [[oxymetazoline]], and [[xylometazoline]].

Tetrahydrozoline is an [[Alpha-adrenergic agonist|alpha agonist]] and its main mechanism of action is the constriction of conjunctival [[blood vessels]].<ref name="pmid15945078">{{cite journal |author=Dahlström M |title=Evidence for different pharmacological targets for imidazoline compounds inhibiting settlement of the barnacle Balanus improvisus |journal=J.

An [[urban legend]] suggests that tetrahydrozoline can cause violent diarrhea if administered orally, such as by putting a few drops of [[Visine]] in an unsuspecting person's beverage.  However, the actual results of the prank may be worse, varying from severe nausea and vomiting to seizures or a coma. Diarrhea is not a side effect.<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Visine Prank: Mickey Red Eyes | url=http://www.snopes.com/medical/myths/visine.asp  | work=Snopes | date=29 June 2009 | accessdate=28 July 2010}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
Tetrahydrozoline was used as a plot device in the 1990 film ''[[The Spirit of '76 (1990 film)|The Spirit of '76]]''. Time travelers from the year 2176, where tetrahydrozoline is a rare commodity, have traveled back to 1976 and have to use tetrahydrozoline eye drops, a common item in 1976, as part of a battery in a time machine in order to return to the future.

The 2005 film ''[[Wedding Crashers]]'' includes the use of eye drops containing tetrahydrozoline to poison a person's drink.
