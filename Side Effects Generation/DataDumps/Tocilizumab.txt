'''Tocilizumab''', also known as '''atlizumab''',  is an [[immunosuppressive drug]], mainly for the treatment of [[rheumatoid arthritis]] (RA) and [[systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis]], a severe form of arthritis in children. It is a [[humanized monoclonal antibody]] against the [[interleukin-6 receptor]] (IL-6R). [[Interleukin 6]] (IL-6) is a [[cytokine]] that plays an important role in immune response and is implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases, such as [[autoimmune diseases]], [[multiple myeloma]] and [[prostate cancer]]. It was developed by [[Hoffmann–La Roche]] and [[Chugai]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Venkiteshwaran|first=Adith|title=Tocilizumab|journal=MAbs|year=2009|volume=1|issue=5|pages=432–438|doi=10.4161/mabs.1.5.9497|url=http://www.landesbioscience.com/journals/17/article/9497/|pmid=20065633|pmc=2759492}}</ref>

==Medical uses==

An infusion takes about an hour.<ref name="AustriaCodex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2009|edition=2009/2010|isbn=3-85200-196-X|language=German}}</ref> An alternative formulation for [[subcutaneous injection]] was approved in October 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gene.com/media/press-releases/14557/2013-10-21/genentech-gains-fda-approval-for-new-sub|title=Genentech Gains FDA Approval for New Subcutaneous Formulation of Actemra for use in Adult Patients Living with Moderately to Severely Active Rheumatoid Arthritis|publisher=Genentech|date=21 October 2013}}</ref>

===Rheumatoid arthritis===
Tocilizumab is used for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, applied in combination with [[methotrexate]], if other drugs like [[disease-modifying antirheumatic drug]]s (DMARDs) and [[TNF alpha blocker]]s have proven to be ineffective or were not tolerated. It can be used as a monotherapy for patients who do not tolerate methotrexate.<ref name ="R090105">{{cite press release

===Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis===
The treatment of [[systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis]] is similar to RA treatment: tocilizumab is combined with methotrexate unless the latter is not tolerated. General safety and effectiveness is established for children of two years and older.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Tocilizumab in Patients With Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis: Efficacy Data From the Placebo-Controlled 12-Week Part of the Phase 3 TENDER Trial|journal=Ann Rheum Dis|year=2010|volume=69|issue=Suppl 3|page=146|last1=Chaitow|first1=J|last2=De Benedetti|first2=F|last3=Brunner|first3=H|last4=Ruperto|first4=N|display-authors=3}}</ref>

On 30 August 2017, the FDA approved tocilizumab for [[cytokine release syndrome]], a side effect of [[Chimeric antigen receptor|CAR-T cell]] therapies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/ApprovedDrugs/ucm574154.htm?platform=hootsuite|title=FDA approves tisagenlecleucel for B-cell ALL and tocilizumab for cytokine release syndrome|date=30 August 2017|publisher=[[US FDA]]}}</ref>

==Pregnancy and lactation==
No clinical studies evaluating the risk for unborn children are available. A study using large doses of tocilizumab in pregnant animals has found an increased likelihood for spontaneous abortion and death of the unborn. It is not known whether the drug is secreted into the breast milk, nor if this would pose a risk for the nursling.<ref name="RoActemra" />

==Contraindications==
The application of tocilizumab is contraindicated during acute infections, as well as under latent [[tuberculosis]].<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile">{{cite book|title=Arzneistoff-Profile|editor=Dinnendahl, V |editor2=Fricke, U|publisher=Govi Pharmazeutischer Verlag|location=Eschborn, Germany|year=2010|edition=23|volume=4|isbn=978-3-7741-9846-3|language=German}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
The most common adverse effects observed in clinical trials were [[upper respiratory tract infection]]s (more than 10% of patients), [[nasopharyngitis]] (common cold), headache, and high blood pressure (at least 5%). The enzyme [[alanine transaminase]] was also elevated in at least 5% of patients, but in most cases without symptoms. Elevated total cholesterol levels were common.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Genovese | first1 = M. C. | last2 = McKay | first2 = J. D. | last3 = Nasonov | first3 = E.

Rare but severe reactions were [[gastrointestinal perforation]]s (0.26% in six months) and [[anaphylaxis]] (0.2%).<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" />

==Interactions==
There are no certain interactions with other drugs. The blood plasma levels of [[simvastatin]] were reduced by 57% after a single dose of tocilizumab, but it is not known whether this is clinically relevant. A possible mechanism is that the elevated IL-6 levels of patients with RA suppress the biosynthesis of various [[cytochrome P450]] enzymes, notably [[CYP1A2]], [[CYP2C9]], [[CYP2C19]] and [[CYP3A4]]. Tocilizumab lowers IL-6 and thus normalises cytochrome levels, increasing the metabolization of simvastatin (and possibly other cytochrome metabolised drugs).<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" />

==Mechanism of action==
Besides other functions, [[interleukin 6]] (IL-6) is involved in the development of immunological and inflammatory reactions. [[Autoimmune disease]]s like RA are associated with abnormally high IL-6 levels. Tocilizumab binds soluble as well as membrane bound interleukin-6 receptors, hindering IL-6 from exerting its pro-inflammatory effects.<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" /><ref>{{cite journal|pmid=19297346|year=2010|last1=Jones|first1=G|last2=Sebba|first2=A|last3=Gu|first3=J|last4=Lowenstein|first4=MB|last5=Calvo|first5=A|last6=Gomez-Reino|first6=JJ|last7=Siri|first7=DA|last8=Tomsic|first8=M|last9=Alecock|first9=E|last10=Woodworth|first10=T.|last11=Genovese|first11=M.

==History==
Interleukin 6 and its receptor were discovered and cloned at [[Osaka University]], Japan, by [[Tadamitsu Kishimoto]] in the 1980s. In 1997, [[Chugai Pharmaceuticals]] began the clinical development of tocilizumab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Clinical studies for Castleman's disease and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis started in 2001 and 2002, respectively. Hoffmann–La Roche co-developed the drug due to a license agreement in 2003.<ref name="KPJ">{{cite web|url=http://www.krankenpflege-journal.com/rheuma/768-die-entwicklung-von-tocilizumab-medizinischer-fortschritt-auf-basis-einer-erfolgreichen-kooperation-von-chugai-und-roche.html|language=German|title=Die Entwicklung von Tocilizumab|trans_title=The development of tocilizumab|author=Markus Harwart|year=2008|publisher=Krankenpflege-Journal}}</ref>
