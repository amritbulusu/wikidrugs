Other [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] include [[fever]], rash, [[dermatographism]], [[hyperpigmentation]], [[alopecia]] (hair loss) and [[Raynaud's phenomenon]] (discoloration of fingers and toes).

== Mechanism of action ==
Bleomycin acts by induction of [[DNA]] strand breaks.<ref>Takimoto CH, Calvo E. [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/chapter03/article/10165/1402628 "Principles of Oncologic Pharmacotherapy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515221337/http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/chapter03/article/10165/1402628 |date=2009-05-15 }} in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ (Eds) [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/ Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004224102/http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/ |date=2013-10-04 }}. 11 ed. 2008.</ref> Some studies suggest bleomycin also inhibits incorporation of [[thymidine]] into DNA strands. DNA cleavage by bleomycin depends on oxygen and metal ions, at least ''in vitro''. The exact mechanism of DNA strand scission is unresolved, but it has been suggested that bleomycin [[chelation|chelates]] metal ions (primarily iron), producing a pseudoenzyme that reacts with oxygen to produce superoxide and hydroxide [[free radicals]] that cleave DNA. An alternative hypothesis states that bleomycin may bind at specific sites in the DNA strand and induce scission by abstracting the hydrogen atom from the base, resulting in strand cleavage as the base undergoes a [[Criegee rearrangement|Criegee-type rearrangement]], or forms an alkali-labile lesion.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 10650103 | year = 2000 | last1 = Hecht | first1 = SM|title=Bleomycin: new perspectives on the mechanism of action |volume=63|pages=158–168|journal=J. Nat. Prod. | doi=10.1021/np990549f}}</ref> In addition, these complexes also mediate [[lipid peroxidation]] and oxidation of other cellular molecules. Therefore, bleomycin is used in combination with [[doxorubicin]] in Hodgkins lymphoma, as they have additive and complementary effects on the DNA, since doxorubicin acts by [[Intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalating]] between DNA  strands, and also acts on [[topoisomerase|topoisomerase II]] enzyme thus relaxing the topoisomerase complexes.

== Biosynthesis ==
Bleomycin is a [[nonribosomal peptide]] that is a hybrid [[peptide]]-[[polyketide]] [[natural product]].  The [[peptide]]/[[polyketide]]/[[peptide]] backbone of the bleomycin [[aglycon]] is assembled by the bleomycin megasynthetase, which is made of both nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) modules. Nonribosomal peptides and polyketides are synthesized from amino acids and short carboxylic acids by NRPSs and PKSs, respectively. These NRPSs and PKSs use similar strategies for the assembly of these two distinct classes of natural products. Both NRPs and type I PKSs are organized into modules. The structural variations of the resulting peptide and polyketide products are determined by the number and order of modules on each NRPS and PKS protein.

The biosynthesis of the bleomycin aglycon can be visualized in three stages:

#NRPS-mediated formation of P-3A from Ser, Asn, His, and Ala
#PKS-mediated elongation of P-3A by malonyl CoA and AdoMet to yield P-4
#NRPS-mediated elongation of P-4 by Thr to P-5 that is further elongated by β-Ala, Cys, and Cys to get P-6m.

On the basis of the bleomycin structure and the deduced functions of individual NRPS and PKS domains and modules, a linear model for the bleomycin megasynthetase-templated assembly of the bleomycin peptide/polyketide/peptide aglycon was proposed from nine amino acids and one acetate.

== History ==
{{see also|History of cancer chemotherapy}}
Bleomycin was first discovered in 1966 when the Japanese scientist [[Hamao Umezawa]] found anticancer activity while screening culture filtrates of ''[[Streptomyces verticillus]]''. Umezawa published his discovery in 1966.<ref>Umenzawa, H. et al. ''J. Antibiot.'' (Tokyo) Ser. A 1966, 19, 200.</ref> The drug was launched in Japan by [[Nippon Kayaku]] in 1969. In the US, bleomycin gained [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approval in July 1973. It was initially marketed in the US by the [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] precursor, Bristol Laboratories, under the brand name Blenoxane.

==Research==
Bleomycin is used in research to induce [[pulmonary fibrosis]] in mice.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Vagotomy attenuates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep13419|quote=In our studies, mice developed classic PF with structural alteration of the lung following intravenous bleomycin treatment|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503222228/http://www.nature.com/articles/srep13419|archivedate=2016-05-03|df=}}</ref>
