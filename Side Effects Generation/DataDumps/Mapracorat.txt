It is in [[clinical trial]]s for the topical treatment of [[atopic dermatitis]],<ref name="NCT00944632">{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00944632|Dose Escalation of Different Concentrations of ZK 245186 in Atopic Dermatitis}}</ref> inflammation following [[cataract surgery]],<ref name="NCT00905450">{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00905450|Evaluation of BOL-303242-X Versus Vehicle for the Treatment of Inflammation Following Cataract Surgery}}</ref> and [[allergic conjunctivitis]].<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT01289431Mapracorat Ophthalmic Formulation in Subjects With Allergic Conjunctivitis}}</ref> Preliminary investigation for the treatment of [[keratoconjunctivitis sicca]] has been conducted in cellular models.<ref name="pmid20824100" />

== Clinical trials==
Phase II clinical trials with mapracorat started in summer 2009. One trial was a [[double blind]] dose finding study for an [[ointment]] against atopic dermatitis. It tested concentrations of 0.01%, 0.03% and 0.1% versus [[placebo]] over four weeks in around 64 patients. This trial was conducted by Intendis, a part of [[Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals]] specialized on [[dermatology]], and completed in September or October 2010.<ref name="NCT00944632" /> The other trial, also with a double blind design, evaluated an [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmic]] [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] for the treatment of inflammation following cataract surgery. Various concentrations and dosing schemes were tested versus placebo in about 550 patients. The study was conducted by [[Bausch & Lomb]] and completed in September 2010.<ref name="NCT00905450" /> Its successor study, a phase III trial, started in November 2010 and completed in August 2011.<ref name="NCT01230125">{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT01230125|Mapracorat Ophthalmic Suspension for the Treatment of Ocular Inflammation Following Cataract Surgery}}</ref>

{{as of|2017|1}} no study results are available.
