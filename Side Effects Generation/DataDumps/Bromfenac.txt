'''Bromfenac''' is a [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] (NSAID)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rovere|first=Giuseppe|last2=Nadal-Nicolás|first2=Francisco M.|last3=Sobrado-Calvo|first3=Paloma|last4=García-Bernal|first4=David|last5=Villegas-Pérez|first5=Maria Paz|last6=Vidal-Sanz|first6=Manuel|last7=Agudo-Barriuso|first7=Marta|date=2016-11-01|title=Topical Treatment With Bromfenac Reduces Retinal Gliosis and Inflammation After Optic Nerve Crush|journal=Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science|volume=57|issue=14|pages=6098–6106|doi=10.1167/iovs.16-20425|issn=1552-5783|pmid=27832276}}</ref> marketed in the US as an [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmic]] solution (current brand names '''Prolensa''' and '''Bromday''',<ref name="Drugs.com">[[Drugs.com]]: {{Drugs.com|monograph|bromfenac-sodium}} for bromfenac sodium.</ref> prior formulation brand name '''Xibrom''', which has since been discontinued) by [[ISTA Pharmaceuticals]] for short-term, local use. Prolensa and Bromday are the once-daily formulation of bromfenac, while Xibrom was approved for twice-daily administration. In Europe, the trade name is '''Yellox'''. Bromfenac is indicated for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain after [[cataract surgery]].<ref name="AC">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2015|language=German}}</ref>

==Medical use==
The [[FDA]] and European approvals for bromfenac are for use one day before and two weeks following cataract surgery for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain.<ref name="Drugs.com" /><ref name="AC" /> The drug has been shown to reduce [[macular edema]] and thickness of the [[retina]] (an indicator for inflammation) and improve visual acuity after surgery.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Topical bromfenac for prevention and treatment of cystoid macular edema following cataract surgery: a review|journal=Clinical ophthalmology (Auckland, N.Z.)|volume=10|pages=2099–2111|pmid=27822006|pmc=5087782|doi=10.2147/OPTH.S86971|year=2016|author1=Sheppard|first1=J. D.}}</ref>

==Contraindications==
Bromfenac is contraindicated for people with adverse reactions to NSAIDs, such as asthma or rashes.<ref name="AC" /><ref name="EPAR">{{cite web|title=Yellox Summary of Product Characteristics|publisher=[[European Medicines Agency]]|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Product_Information/human/001198/WC500107575.pdf|date=11 January 2016}}</ref>

==Side effects==
Bromfenac eye drops are generally well tolerated. Comparatively common side effects in clinical studies included abnormal sensations in eye (0.5% of people treated with bromfenac), mild to moderate erosion of the [[cornea]] (0.4%), eye [[pruritus]] (0.4%), eye pain (0.3%) and redness (0.3%). Serious side effects such as [[corneal perforation]] were not reported in studies but only during post-marketing in less than one patient in 1000.<ref name="AC" /><ref name="EPAR" />

==Interactions==
No systematic interaction studies have been performed. There are no known cases of interactions with antibiotic eye drops.<ref name="AC" /><ref name="EPAR" /> [[Blood plasma]] levels remain very low during bromfenac therapy, so interactions with drugs taken by mouth are unlikely.

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===
{{main|Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug#Mechanism of action}}
As an NSAID, bromfenac works by inhibiting [[prostaglandin]] synthesis by blocking the [[cyclooxygenase]] (COX) enzymes. It preferably acts on [[COX-2]] and only has a low affinity for [[COX-1]].<ref name="EPAR" />

===Pharmacokinetics===
[[File:Bromfenac cyclic amide.svg|thumb|Bromfenac [[lactam]], the main metabolite in urine]]
Bromfenac is well absorbed through the cornea and reaches highest concentrations in the [[aqueous humour]] after 150 to 180 minutes, with a [[biological half-life]] of 1.4 hours and high drug levels being maintained for at least 12 hours. It is mainly concentrated in the aqueous humour and [[conjunctiva]], and much less in the [[lens (anatomy)|lens]] and [[vitreous body]].<ref name="AC" /><ref name="EPAR" />

Concentrations in the blood plasma are too low to be measured quantitatively. 99.8% of the substance are bound to plasma proteins. The enzyme mainly responsible for [[metabolization]] of bromfenac is [[CYP2C9]], and metabolites include the [[lactam]] and several [[Conjugation (pharmacology)|conjugated]] compounds. 82% are excreted via the urine, and 13% via the [[faeces]].<ref name="AC" /><ref name="EPAR" />

The high degree of penetration and potency of bromfenac can be attributed to the [[halogenation]] of the molecule: by adding a bromine the NSAID becomes highly lipophilic which allows for rapid, sustained drug levels in the ocular tissues.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Chemistry==
Along with [[indomethacin]], [[diclofenac]] and others, bromfenac belongs to the acetic acid group of NSAIDs. It is used in form of bromfenac sodium · 1.5 [[Water of crystallization|H<sub>2</sub>O]] ([[CAS number]]: {{CAS|120638-55-3}}), which is soluble in water, [[methanol]] and aqueous bases, insoluble in [[chloroform]] and aqueous acids, and melts at {{convert|284 to 286|C|F}} under decomposition.<ref>{{cite book|title=Arzneistoff-Profile|editor1=Dinnendahl, V |editor2=Fricke, U |publisher=Govi Pharmazeutischer Verlag|location=Eschborn, Germany|date=2012|edition=26|volume=2|isbn=978-3-7741-9846-3|language=German}}</ref>

==History==
For ophthalmic use, bromfenac has been prescribed more than 20,000,000 times across the world.<ref name="EPAR" /> As an eye drop, it has been available since 2000, starting in Japan where it was sold as ''Bronuck''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ethical Products for Medical Professionals|publisher=Senju Pharmaceutical|access-date=11 December 2016|url=http://www.senju.co.jp/english/products/mp.html}}</ref> It was first FDA approved for use in the United States in 2005, and it was marketed as ''Xibrom'', twice-daily.<ref name="approval">{{Drugs.com|pro|xibrom}} for Xibrom.</ref> In October 2010 ''Bromday'' received FDA approval as a new, once-daily formulation.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} More recently, in 2013, ''Prolensa'' has also been approved by the FDA.<ref name="approval" /> Bromfenac eye drops have been marketed in Europe since 2011<ref name="EPAR" /> and are available on worldwide markets with agreements from [[Bausch & Lomb]],<ref name="EPAR" /> [[Croma-Pharma]], and other companies.

Bromfenac was formerly marketed in the United States by [[Wyeth-Ayerst]] in an oral formulation called ''Duract'' for short-term relief of pain (less than 10 days at a time). It was brought to market in July 1997 and was withdrawn 22 June 1998 following numerous reports of [[hepatotoxicity]] in patients who had taken the medication for longer than the recommended 10-day period.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Bromfenac(Duract)-associated hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation|journal=The American Journal of Gastroenterology|volume=94|issue=8|pages=2299|doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.1999.01321.x|pmid=10445569|year=1999|last1=Hunter|first1=Ellen B.|last2=Johnston|first2=Philip E.|last3=Tanner|first3=Gordon|last4=Pinson|first4=C.
