'''Isopropylphenidate''' (also known as '''IPH''' and '''IPPD''') is a [[piperidine]] based [[stimulant]] drug, closely related to [[methylphenidate]], but with the methyl [[ester]] replaced by an [[isopropyl]] ester. It has similar effects to methylphenidate but with a longer duration of action,<ref>Markowitz JS, Zhu HJ, Patrick KS. Isopropylphenidate: an ester homolog of methylphenidate with sustained and selective dopaminergic activity and reduced drug interaction liability.
