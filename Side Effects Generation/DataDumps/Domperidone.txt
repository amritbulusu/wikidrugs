==Medical uses==
The uses or ''indications'' of domperidone vary between nations. For instance, in Italy it is used in the treatment of [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] and in Canada, the drug is indicated in upper gastrointestinal motility disorders and to prevent gastrointestinal symptoms associated with the use of dopamine agonist antiparkinsonian agents.<ref>[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/alt_formats/pdf/medeff/bulletin/carn-bcei_v17n1-eng.pdf "Domperidone - heart rate and rhythm disorders."] Canadian adverse reactions newsletter. Government of Canada. January 2007 17(1)</ref> In the United States, domperidone is not currently a legally marketed human drug and it is not approved for sale in the U.S. On 7 June 2004, FDA issued a public warning that distributing any domperidone-containing products is illegal.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/drugs/developmentapprovalprocess/howdrugsaredevelopedandapproved/approvalapplications/investigationalnewdrugindapplication/ucm368736.htm | title = How to Obtain | publisher = Food and Drug Administration | date = 10 February 2015 | access-date = 24 February 2016}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, domperidone is only indicated for the treatment of nausea and vomiting and the treatment duration is usually limited to 1 week.

It was reported in 2007 that domperidone is available in 58 countries, including [[Canada]].<ref name="pmid17488253">{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddymasu SC, Soykan I, McCallum RW | title = Domperidone: review of pharmacology and clinical applications in gastroenterology | journal = Am.

===Gastroparesis===
[[Gastroparesis]] is a medical condition characterised by delayed emptying of the stomach when there is no mechanical [[stomach|gastric outlet obstruction]]. Its cause is most commonly [[idiopathic]], a [[diabetes|diabetic complication]] or a result of abdominal surgery. The condition causes nausea, vomiting, [[postprandial|fullness after eating]], early satiety (feeling full before the meal is finished), abdominal pain and bloating.

Domperidone may be useful in diabetic and idiopathic [[gastroparesis]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Stevens JE, Jones KL, Rayner CK, Horowitz M | title = Pathophysiology and pharmacotherapy of gastroparesis: current and future perspectives | journal = Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy | volume = 14 | issue = 9 | pages = 1171–86 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23663133 | doi = 10.1517/14656566.2013.795948 }}</ref><ref name="pmid9663360">{{cite journal | vauthors = Silvers D, Kipnes M, Broadstone V, Patterson D, Quigley EM, McCallum R, Leidy NK, Farup C, Liu Y, Joslyn A | title = Domperidone in the management of symptoms of diabetic gastroparesis: efficacy, tolerability, and quality-of-life outcomes in a multicenter controlled trial.

However, increased rate of gastric emptying induced by drugs like domperidone does not always correlate (equate) well with relief of symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Janssen P, Harris MS, Jones M, Masaoka T, Farré R, Törnblom H, Van Oudenhove L, Simrén M, Tack J | title = The relation between symptom improvement and gastric emptying in the treatment of diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis | journal = The American Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 108 | issue = 9 | pages = 1382–91 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 24005344 | doi = 10.1038/ajg.2013.118 }}</ref>

===Parkinson's disease===
[[Parkinson's disease]] is a chronic neurological condition where a decrease in dopamine in the brain leads to rigidity (stiffness of movement), [[tremor]] and other symptoms and signs. Poor gastrointestinal function, nausea and vomiting is a major problem for people with Parkinson's disease because most medications used to treat Parkinson's disease are given by mouth. These medications, such as [[levodopa]], can cause nausea as a [[side effect]]. Furthermore, anti-nausea drugs, such as [[metoclopramide]], which do cross the blood–brain barrier may worsen the [[extra-pyramidal]] symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

Domperidone can be used to relieve gastrointestinal symptoms in Parkinson's disease; it blocks peripheral D2 receptors but does not cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] in normal doses (the barrier between the blood [[Blood circulation|circulation]] of the brain and the rest of the body) so has no effect on the extrapyramidal symptoms of the disease.<ref>{{cite journal |pmc=3962062 | pmid=24660005 | doi=10.1177/1715163514521969 | volume=147 | title=Domperidone as an unintended antipsychotic | journal=Can Pharm J (Ott) | pages=76–7 | vauthors=Ferrier J}}</ref> In addition to this, domperidone may enhance the [[bioavailability]] (effect) of [[levodopa]] (one of the main treatments in Parkinson's disease).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nishikawa N, Nagai M, Tsujii T, Iwaki H, Yabe H, Nomoto M | title = Coadministration of domperidone increases plasma levodopa concentration in patients with Parkinson disease | journal = Clinical Neuropharmacology | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 182–4 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22751085 | doi = 10.1097/WNF.0b013e3182575cdb }}</ref>

Although these features make domperidone a useful drug in Parkinson's disease, caution is needed due to the [[cardiotoxicity|cardiotoxic]] side effects of domperidone especially when given intravenously, in elderly people and in high doses (> 30&nbsp;mg per day).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lertxundi U, Domingo-Echaburu S, Soraluce A, García M, Ruiz-Osante B, Aguirre C | title = Domperidone in Parkinson's disease: a perilous arrhythmogenic or the gold standard? | journal = Current Drug Safety | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–8 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23656449 | doi = 10.2174/1574886311308010009 | url = http://www.eurekaselect.com/110655/article }}</ref> A clinical sign of domperidone's potential [[toxic]]ity to the heart is the prolongation (lengthening) of the [[QT interval]] (a segment of the heart's electrical pattern).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Malek NM, Grosset KA, Stewart D, Macphee GJ, Grosset DG | title = Prescription of drugs with potential adverse effects on cardiac conduction in Parkinson's disease | journal = Parkinsonism & Related Disorders | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 586–9 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23522959 | doi = 10.1016/j.parkreldis.2013.02.004 }}</ref>

===Functional dyspepsia===
Domperidone may be used in [[functional dyspepsia]] in both adults and children.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Xiao M, Qiu X, Yue D, Cai Y, Mo Q | title = Influence of hippophae rhamnoides on two appetite factors, gastric emptying and metabolic parameters, in children with functional dyspepsia | journal = Hellenic Journal of Nuclear Medicine | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 38–43 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23529392 | doi = 10.1967/s002449910070 | doi-broken-date = 2017-01-14 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Huang X, Lv B, Zhang S, Fan YH, Meng LN | title = Itopride therapy for functional dyspepsia: a meta-analysis | journal = World Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 18 | issue = 48 | pages = 7371–7 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23326147 | pmc = 3544044 | doi = 10.3748/wjg.v18.i48.7371 }}</ref>

===Lactation===
The hormone [[prolactin]] stimulates lactation (production of breast milk). [[Dopamine]], released by the [[hypothalamus]] stops the release of prolactin from the [[pituitary gland]]. Domperidone, by acting as an anti-dopaminergic agent, results in increased [[prolactin]] secretion, and thus promotes lactation (that is, it is a [[galactogogue]]). In some nations, including Australia, domperidone is used [[off-label]], based on uncertain and anecdotal evidence of its usefulness, as a therapy for mothers who are having difficulty breastfeeding.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Grzeskowiak LE, Lim SW, Thomas AE, Ritchie U, Gordon AL | title = Audit of domperidone use as a galactogogue at an Australian tertiary teaching hospital | journal = Journal of Human Lactation | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 32–7 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23015150 | doi = 10.1177/0890334412459804 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Donovan TJ, Buchanan K | title = Medications for increasing milk supply in mothers expressing breastmilk for their preterm hospitalised infants | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 3 | issue =  3| pages = CD005544 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22419310 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005544.pub2 }}</ref> In the United States, domperidone is not approved for this or any other use.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = da Silva OP, Knoppert DC | title = Domperidone for lactating women | journal = CMAJ | volume = 171 | issue = 7 | pages = 725–6 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15451832 | pmc = 517853 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.1041054 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/psn/printer.cfm?id=253 "FDA warns against women using unapproved drug, domperidone to increase milk production."] [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] 7 June 2004.</ref> A study called the ''EMPOWER'' trial has been designed to assess the effectiveness and safety of domperidone in assisting mothers of [[preterm]] babies to supply breast milk for their infants.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Asztalos EV, Campbell-Yeo M, daSilva OP, Kiss A, Knoppert DC, Ito S | title = Enhancing breast milk production with Domperidone in mothers of preterm neonates (EMPOWER trial) | journal = BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth | volume = 12 | issue =  | pages = 87 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22935052 | pmc = 3532128 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2393-12-87 }}</ref>

==Side effects==
Side effects associated with domperidone include [[dry mouth]], [[abdominal cramp]]s, [[diarrhea]], [[nausea]], [[rash]], [[pruritus|itching]], [[urticaria|hives]], and [[hyperprolactinemia]] (the symptoms of which may include [[mammoplasia|breast enlargement]], [[galactorrhea]], [[mastodynia|breast pain/tenderness]], [[gynecomastia]], [[hypogonadism]], and [[irregular menstruation|menstrual irregularities]]).<ref name="Henderson2003">{{cite journal|last1=Henderson|first1=Amanda|title=Domperidone: Discovering New Choices for Lactating Mothers|journal=AWHONN Lifelines|volume=7|issue=1|year=2003|pages=54–60|issn=1091-5923|doi=10.1177/1091592303251726|pmid=12674062}}</ref> Due to blockade of D<sub>2</sub> receptors in the [[central nervous system]], D<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists like [[metoclopramide]] can also produce a variety of additional side effects including [[drowsiness]], [[akathisia]], [[psychomotor agitation|restlessness]], [[insomnia]], [[lassitude]], [[fatigue (medicine)|fatigue]], [[extrapyramidal symptom]]s, [[dystonia]], [[parkinsonism|Parkinsonian symptom]]s, [[tardive dyskinesia]], and [[depression (mood)|depression]].<ref name="ReddymasuSoykan2007" /><ref name="pmid10332535" /> However, this is not the case with domperidone, because, unlike other D<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists, it minimally crosses the [[blood-brain-barrier]], and for this reason, is rarely associated with such side effects.<ref name="ReddymasuSoykan2007" /><ref name="pmid10332535" />

UK drug regulatory authorities (MHRA) [http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Safetyinformation/DrugSafetyUpdate/CON418518 have issued] the following restriction on domperidone in 2014 due to increased risk of adverse cardiac effects:

{{Quotation|''Domperidone (Motilium) is associated with a small increased risk of serious cardiac side effects. Its use is now restricted to the relief of nausea and vomiting and the dosage and duration of use have been reduced. It should no longer be used for the treatment of bloating and heartburn. Domperidone is now contraindicated in those with underlying cardiac conditions and other risk factors. Patients with these conditions and patients receiving long-term treatment with domperidone should be reassessed at a routine appointment, in light of the new advice.''}}

However, a 2015 Australian review concluded the following:<ref name="pmid26117678" />

{{Quotation|''Based on the results of the two TQT (the regulatory agency gold standard for assessment of QT prolongation) domperidone does not appear to be strongly associated with QT prolongation at oral doses of 20 mg QID in healthy volunteers. Further, there are limited case reports supporting an association with cardiac dysfunction, and the frequently cited case-control studies have significant flaws. While there remains an ill-defined risk at higher systemic concentrations, especially in patients with a higher baseline risk of QT prolongation, our review does not support the view that domperidone presents intolerable risk.''}}

====Possible central toxicity in infants====
In [[United Kingdom|Britain]] a legal case involved the death of two children of a mother whose three children had all had [[hypernatraemia]]. She was charged with poisoning the children with salt. One of the children, who was born at 28 weeks gestation with [[respiratory]] complications and had a [[fundoplication]] for [[gastroesophageal reflux]] and [[failure to thrive]] was prescribed domperidone. An [[advocate]] for the mother suggested the child may have suffered [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] as a side effect of domperidone due to the drug crossing the child's immature [[blood-brain-barrier]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Coulthard MG, Haycock GB | title = Distinguishing between salt poisoning and hypernatraemic dehydration in children | journal = BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.) | volume = 326 | issue = 7381 | pages = 157–60 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12531853 | pmc = 1128889 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.326.7381.157 | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12531853 }}</ref>

==Interactions==
Domperidone is almost exclusively metabolized by [[CYP3A4]], and for this reason, [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]]s and [[enzyme inducer|inducer]]s of this [[enzyme]] may alter the metabolism and concentrations of domperidone. Moreover, domperidone has been identified as a modest [[suicide inhibition|mechanism-based (irreversible)]] inhibitor of CYP3A4 (K<sub>i</sub> = 12 μM), and it has been estimated that it may increase the serum concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates by approximately 50%.<ref name="pmid20082577">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chang SY, Fancher RM, Zhang H, Gan J | title = Mechanism-based inhibition of human cytochrome P4503A4 by domperidone | journal = Xenobiotica | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 138–45 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20082577 | doi = 10.3109/00498250903406762 | url = }}</ref>

[[Itraconazole]] and [[ketoconazole]], both used to treat fungal infections, are potent CYP3A4 inhibitors and increase the [[pharmacokinetics|plasma concentration]] of domperidone.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yoshizato T, Kotegawa T, Imai H, Tsutsumi K, Imanaga J, Ohyama T, Ohashi K | title = Itraconazole and domperidone: a placebo-controlled drug interaction study | journal = European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 1287–94 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22418831 | doi = 10.1007/s00228-012-1258-x }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Boyce MJ, Baisley KJ, Warrington SJ | title = Pharmacokinetic interaction between domperidone and ketoconazole leads to QT prolongation in healthy volunteers: a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study | journal = British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 73 | issue = 3 | pages = 411–21 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 21883386 | pmc = 3370345 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2125.2011.04093.x }}</ref> In healthy volunteers, ketoconazole increased the [[Cmax (pharmacology)|C<sub>max</sub>]] and [[Area under the curve (pharmacokinetics)|AUC]] concentrations of domperidone by 3- to 10-fold.<ref name="Aronson2009">{{cite book|author=Jeffrey K.

[[Erythromycin]] and certain other [[macrolide]] antibiotics are CYP3A4 inhibitors and inhibit the metabolism of domperidone (''[[in vitro]]''), thus increasing the concentration of domperidone and potential side effects of the drug. This is of concern as both drugs may be used to treat gastroparesis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ung D, Parkman HP, Nagar S | title = Metabolic interactions between prokinetic agents domperidone and erythromycin: an in vitro analysis | journal = Xenobiotica | volume = 39 | issue = 10 | pages = 749–56 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19575604 | doi = 10.1080/00498250903096121 }}</ref>

===Pharmacodynamics===
Domperidone is a peripherally selective dopamine [[D2 receptor|D<sub>2</sub>]] and [[D3 receptor|D<sub>3</sub> receptor]] antagonist.<ref name="pmid10332535" /> It has no clinically significant interaction with the [[D1 receptor|D<sub>1</sub> receptor]], unlike metoclopramide.<ref name="pmid10332535" /> The drug provides relief from nausea by blocking receptors at the [[chemoreceptor trigger zone]] (a location in the [[nervous system]] that mediates nausea) at the floor of the fourth [[Ventricular system|ventricle]] (a location near the [[brain]]).

====Effects on {{abbr|TSH|thyroid-stimulating hormone}} levels====
Along with prolactin, domperidone has, to a lesser extent, been found to increase the secretion of [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH), even in patients with [[hypothyroidism]].<ref name="pmid3882143" /> A single 4&nbsp;mg intravenous dose of domperidone produced peak TSH levels of 1.9-fold above baseline and peak prolactin levels of 23-fold above baseline (which occurred at 30 minutes post-administration) in women with hypothyroidism.<ref name="pmid3882143" /> Levels of TSH and prolactin decreased to 1.6-fold and 17-fold above baseline, respectively, at 120 minutes post-administration.<ref name="pmid3882143" />
