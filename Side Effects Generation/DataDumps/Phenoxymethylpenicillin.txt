Penicillin V is sometimes used in the treatment of [[Wiktionary:odontogenic|odontogenic]] infections.

It is less active than [[benzylpenicillin]] (penicillin G) against [[Gram-negative bacteria]].<ref name="Garrod1960">

Phenoxymethylpenicillin is more acid-stable than benzylpenicillin, which allows it to be given orally.

Phenoxymethylpenicillin is usually used only for the treatment of mild to moderate infections, and not for severe or deep-seated infections since [[Absorption (pharmacokinetics)|absorption]] can be unpredictable. Except for the treatment or prevention of infection with ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' (which is uniformly sensitive to penicillin), therapy should be guided by bacteriological studies (including sensitivity tests) and by clinical response.<ref name="DailyMed"/> People treated initially with [[parenteral]] benzylpenicillin may continue treatment with phenoxymethylpenicillin by mouth once a satisfactory response has been obtained.<ref name="Martindale">{{cite book|editor=Sweetman S.|title=Martindale: The complete drug reference|publisher=Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain and the Pharmaceutical Press|location=London|year=2002|edition=Electronic version}}</ref>

It is not active against [[beta-lactamase]]-producing bacteria, which include many strains of ''[[staphylococcus|Staphylococci]]''.<ref name="DailyMed">{{cite web|url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?id=645|title=Penicillin V Potassium tablet: Drug Label Sections|date=December 2006|publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine|U.S. National Library of Medicine]], [[Daily Med]]: Current Medication Information|accessdate=2009-08-02|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727065618/http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?id=645|archivedate=2009-07-27|df=}}</ref>

== Adverse effects ==
{{further|Penicillin drug reaction}}
Phenoxymethylpenicillin is usually well tolerated but may occasionally cause transient [[nausea]], vomiting, epigastric distress, [[diarrhea]], constipation, acidic smell to urine and [[black hairy tongue]]. A previous [[hypersensitivity|hypersensitivity reaction]] to ''any'' [[penicillin]] is a [[contraindication]].<ref name="Martindale"/><ref name="DailyMed"/>

==Mechanism of action==
It exerts a [[Bactericidal#Bactericidal antibiotics|bactericidal]] action against penicillin-sensitive microorganisms during the stage of active multiplication. It acts by [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibiting]] the [[protein biosynthesis|biosynthesis]] of cell-wall [[peptidoglycan]].
