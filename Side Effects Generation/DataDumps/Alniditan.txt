'''Alniditan''' is a [[5-HT1D receptor|5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptor]] [[agonist]] with [[migraine]]-preventative effects.<ref name="pmid8967979">{{cite journal |vauthors=Leysen JE, Gommeren W, Heylen L |title=Alniditan, a new 5-hydroxytryptamine1D agonist and migraine-abortive agent: ligand-binding properties of human 5-hydroxytryptamine1D alpha, human 5-hydroxytryptamine1D beta, and calf 5-hydroxytryptamine1D receptors investigated with [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine and [3H]alniditan |journal=Mol.

==Synthesis==
The sizeable number of serotonergic drugs for treating migraines all incorporate the indole nucleus found in serotonin itself. It is
thus of interest that a compound based on a [[benzopyran]] manifests much the same activity.

Alkylation of [[phenol]] with 2-bromobutyrolactone ('''2''') leads to the ether ('''3'''). Oxidation of that product with [[chromium trioxide]] then leads to the substituted [[succinic anhydride]] ('''4'''). Treatment of anhydride with [[polyphosphoric acid]] leads to
the [[acylation]] of the aromatic ring and the formation of the [[benzopyranone]] ring ('''5'''). The [[ketonyl]] group is then selectively reduced by any of several methods, as, for example, conversion to a [[dithiolane]] followed by [[Mozingo reduction]] to '''6'''. The [[carboxylic acid]] is next reduced to the corresponding [[aldehyde]] ('''7''') by successive conversion to an [[acid chloride]] followed by [[hydrogenation]] in the presence of [[thiophene]]. A second [[hydrogenation]] in the presence of [[benzylamine]] leads to the [[reductive amination]] product ('''8'''). [[Michael addition]] of the amino group in '''8''' to [[acrylonitrile]] leads to a [[1,4-addition]] and the formation of ('''9'''). Reduction of the [[nitrile]] affords the [[diamine]] ('''10'''). Reaction of this last diamine with [[tetrahydropyrimidine chloride]] ('''11'''), itself formed by treatment of [[trimethylene urea]] with [[phosphorus oxychloride]], leads to the displacement of halogen by the terminal, and thus more accessible, amino group in ('''10'''). There is thus formed the serotonergic agent alniditan ('''12''').
