==Medical uses==

===Worms===
Levamisole was originally used as an [[anthelmintic]] to treat worm infestations in both humans and animals. Levamisole works as a [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]] [[agonist]] that causes continued stimulation of the parasitic worm muscles, leading to paralysis. In countries that still permit the use of levamisole, the recommended dose for anthelmintic therapy is a single dose, with a repeated dose 7 days later if needed for a severe hookworm infection.<ref>{{cite web|title=Levamisole (Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference)|url=http://online.lexi.com/lco/action/doc/retrieve/docid/martindale_f/1351191|work=Lexicomp|accessdate=21 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221163156/http://online.lexi.com/lco/action/doc/retrieve/docid/martindale_f/1351191|archivedate=21 December 2016|df=}}</ref>  Most current commercial preparations are intended for veterinary use as a [[Deworming|dewormer]] in cattle, pigs, and sheep. However, levamisole has also recently gained prominence among [[aquarists]] as an effective treatment for ''[[Camallanus]]'' [[roundworm]] infestations in [[Freshwater fish|freshwater]] [[tropical fish]].<ref>{{cite web |last        = Sanford |first       = Shari |title       = Levamisole Hydrochloride: Its application and usage in freshwater aquariums |work        =  |publisher   = Loaches Online |year        = 2007 |url         = http://www.loaches.com/disease-treatment/levamisole-hydrochloride-1 |format      =  |doi         =  |accessdate  = 2009-02-27 |deadurl     = no |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090301001606/http://www.loaches.com/disease-treatment/levamisole-hydrochloride-1 |archivedate = 2009-03-01 |df          = }}</ref>

===Cancer===
After being pulled from the market in the U.S. and Canada in 1999 and 2003, respectively, levamisole has been tested in combination with [[fluorouracil]] to treat [[colon cancer]]. Evidence from [[clinical trial]]s support its addition to fluorouracil therapy to benefit patients with colon cancer. In some of the leukemic cell line studies, both levamisole and [[tetramisole]] showed similar effect.<ref>(Chirigos et al. (1969, 1973, 1975)).</ref>

===Other===
Levamisole has been used to treat a variety of dermatologic conditions, including skin infections, [[leprosy]], [[warts]], [[lichen planus]], and [[aphthous ulcer]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Scheinfeld N, Rosenberg JD, Weinberg JM | title =Levamisole in dermatology: a review | year = 2004 | journal = Am J Clin Dermatol | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 97–104 | pmid = 15109274 | doi=10.2165/00128071-200405020-00004}}</ref>

An interesting adverse side effect these reviewers reported in passing was "neurologic excitement". Later papers, from the Janssen group and others, indicate levamisole and its enantiomer, dexamisole, have some mood-elevating or [[antidepressant]] properties, although this was never a marketed use of the drug.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Vanhoutte | first1 = P.

== Adverse effects ==
One of the more serious side effects of levamisole is [[agranulocytosis]], or the depletion of the white blood cells. In particular, neutrophils appear to be affected the most. This occurs in 0.08–5% of the studied populations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Levamisole|url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_chem_info/levamisole.pdf|work=DEA|accessdate=21 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017084451/http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_chem_info/levamisole.pdf|archivedate=17 October 2013|df=}}</ref> There have also been reports of levamisole induced necrosis syndrome in which erythematous painful papules can appear almost anywhere on skin.

== Metabolism ==
Levamisole is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and metabolized in the liver. Its time to peak plasma concentration is 1.5–2 hours. The plasma elimination half-life is fairly quick at 3–4 hours which can contribute to not detecting Levamisole intoxication. The metabolite half-life is 16 hours. Levamisole's excretion is primarily through the kidneys, with about 70% being excreted over 3 days. Only about 5% is excreted as unchanged levamisole.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kouassi|first=E|title=Novel assay and pharmacokinetics of levamisole and p-hydroxylevamisole in human plasma and urine|pmid=3754161|journal=Biopharmaceutics & Drug Disposition|volume=7|issue=1|pages=71–89|doi=10.1002/bdd.2510070110|year=1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Luyckx|first=M|title=Pharmacokinetics of levamisole in healthy subjects and cancer patients|pmid=7166176|journal=European Journal of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics|volume=7|issue=4|pages=247–54|doi=10.1007/bf03189626|year=1982}}</ref>

Drug testing of racehorse urine has led to the revelation that among levamisole equine metabolites are both [[pemoline]] and [[aminorex]], stimulants that are forbidden by racing authorities.<ref>J. Guiterrez et al. (2010) "Pemoline and tetramisole 'positives' in English racehorses following levamisole administration." ''Irish Veterinary Journal'' '''63:8''' 498-500.</ref><ref>E.N. Ho et al.

==Detection in body fluids==
Levamisole may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths involving adulterated street drugs. About 3% of an oral dose is eliminated unchanged in the 24-hour urine of humans. A ''post mortem'' blood levamisole concentration of 2.2&nbsp;mg/L was present in a woman who died of a cocaine overdose.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Vandamme | first1 = TF | last2 = Demoustier | first2 = M | last3 = Rollmann | first3 = B | year = 1995 | title = Quantitation of levamisole in plasma using high performance liquid chromatography | url = | journal = Eur.

The original synthesis at Janssen Pharmaceutica resulted in the preparation of a [[racemic mixture]] of two [[enantiomers]], whose hydrochloride salt was reported to have a melting point of 264–265&nbsp;°C; the free base of the racemate has a melting point of 87–89&nbsp;°C. The racemic mixture is referred to as "tetramisole" - levamisole refers only to the levorotatory enantiomer of tetramisole.

==Toxicity==
The [[LD50|LD<sub>50</sub>]] (intravenous, mouse) is  22&nbsp;mg/kg.<ref name = Sym>J. Symoens et al. (1979). In ''Pharmacological and Biochemical Properties of Drug Substances, Vol. 2'', (M. E. Goldberg, Ed.), pp. 407-464, Washington: American Pharmaceutical Association.</ref>

== Laboratory use ==
Levamisole [[reversible inhibition|reversibly]] and [[non-competitive inhibition|noncompetitively inhibits]] most [[isoform]]s of [[alkaline phosphatase]] (e.g., human liver, bone, kidney, and spleen) except the intestinal and placental isoform.<ref name="pmid6169">{{cite journal |author=Van Belle, H. |title=Alkaline phosphatase. I. Kinetics and inhibition by levamisole of purified isoenzymes from humans |journal=Clin. Chem. |volume=22 |issue=7 |pages=972–6 |year=1976 |pmid=6169 |doi=}}</ref> It is thus used as an inhibitor along with substrate to reduce background alkaline phosphatase activity in biomedical assays involving detection signal amplification by intestinal alkaline phosphatase, for example in [[in situ hybridization|''in situ'' hybridization]] or [[Western blot]] protocols.

It is used to immobilize the nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'' on glass slides for imaging and dissection.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://genetics.wustl.edu/tslab/protocols/dissection-staining-in-situ/gonad-dissections/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517154147/http://genetics.wustl.edu/tslab/protocols/dissection-staining-in-situ/gonad-dissections/ |archivedate=2014-05-17 |df= }} Schedl Lab Protocol for gonad dissections</ref>

In a ''C. elegans'' behavioral assay, analyzing the time course of paralysis provides information about the neuromuscular junction. Levamisole acts as an acetylcholine receptor agonist, which leads to muscle contraction. Continuing activation leads to paralysis. The time course of paralysis provides information about the acetylcholine receptors on the muscle.  For example, mutants with fewer acetylcholine receptors may paralyze slower than wild type.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_acetylcholine/acetylcholine.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224134219/http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_acetylcholine/acetylcholine.html |archivedate=2013-12-24 |df= }}</ref>

==Research==
It has also been studied as a method to stimulate the immune system as part of the treatment of [[cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dillman|first1=RO|title=Cancer immunotherapy.|journal=Cancer biotherapy & radiopharmaceuticals|date=February 2011|volume=26|issue=1|pages=1–64|pmid=21355777|doi=10.1089/cbr.2010.0902}}</ref>
