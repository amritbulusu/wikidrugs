<!-- Definition and medical uses -->
'''Trastuzumab''', sold under the brand name '''Herceptin''' among others, is a [[monoclonal antibody]] used to treat [[breast cancer]].<ref name=AHFS2016/> Specifically it is used for breast cancer that is [[HER2 receptor positive]].<ref name=AHFS2016/> It may be used by itself or together with other [[chemotherapy medication]].<ref name=AHFS2016/> Trastuzumab is given by [[intravenous infusion|slow injection into a vein]] and [[Subcutaneous injection|injection just under the skin]].<ref name=AHFS2016/><ref name=BNF69>{{cite book|title=British national formulary : BNF 69|date=2015|publisher=British Medical Association|isbn=9780857111562|page=626|edition=69}}</ref>

==Medical use==
The safety and efficacy of trastuzumab-containing combination therapies (with chemotherapy, hormone blockers, or [[lapatinib]]) for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.  The overall hazard ratios for overall survival and progression free survival were 0.82 and 0.61, respectively. It was difficult to accurately ascertain the true impact of trastuzumab on survival, as in three of the seven trials, over half of the patients in the control arm were allowed to cross-over and receive trastuzumab after their cancer began to progress.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Balduzzi S, Mantarro S, Guarneri V, Tagliabue L, Pistotti V, Moja L, D'Amico R |title=Trastuzumab-containing regimens for metastatic breast cancer |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=6 |issue= |pages=CD006242 |year=2014 |pmid=24919460 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006242.pub2 |url=}}</ref>  Thus, this analysis likely underestimates the true survival benefit associated with trastuzumab treatment in this population.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cochranelibrary.com/editorial/10.1002/14651858.ED000083 |title=Editorial - Treating metastatic breast cancer: the evidence for targeted therapy &#124; Cochrane Library |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> In these trials, trastuzumab also increased the risk of heart problems, including [[heart failure]] and left ventricular ejection fraction decline.

In early stage (curable) HER2-positive breast cancer, trastuzumab-containing regimens improved overall survival ([[Hazard ratio|HR]] = 0.66) and disease-free survival (HR = 0.60). Increased risk of heart failure (RR = 5.11) and decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (RR = 1.83) were seen in these trials as well.  Two trials involving shorter term treatment with trastuzumab did not differ in efficacy from longer trials, but produced less cardiac toxicity.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Moja L, Tagliabue L, Balduzzi S, Parmelli E, Pistotti V, Guarneri V, D'Amico R |title=Trastuzumab containing regimens for early breast cancer |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=4 |issue= |pages=CD006243 |year=2012 |pmid=22513938 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006243.pub2 |url=}}</ref>

The original studies of trastuzumab showed that it improved overall survival in late-stage (metastatic) HER2-positive breast cancer from 20.3 to 25.1 months.<ref name="Hudis_2007"/> In early stage HER2-positive breast cancer, it reduces the risk of cancer returning after surgery. The absolute reduction in the risk of cancer returning within 3 years was 9.5%, and the absolute reduction in the risk of death within 3 years was reduced by 3%. However, it increases serious heart problems by an absolute risk of 2.1%, though the problems may resolve if treatment is stopped.<ref name=Cochrane2012>{{cite journal |vauthors=Moja L, Tagliabue L, Balduzzi S, etal |title=Trastuzumab containing regimens for early breast cancer|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=4 |issue= |pages=CD006243 |year=2012 |pmid=22513938|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006243.pub2 |url=}}</ref>

It is possible to determine the "erbB2 status" of a tumor, which can be used to predict efficacy of treatment with trastuzumab. If it is determined that a tumor is overexpressing the erbB2 oncogene and the patient has no significant pre-existing heart disease, then a patient is eligible for treatment with trastuzumab.<ref name="YuHung">{{cite journal | first=D | last=Yu |author2=Hung M  | title=Overexpression of ErbB2 in cancer and ErbB2-targeting strategies | journal=Oncogene | year=2000 | volume=19 | pages=6115–6121 | pmid=11156524 |doi=10.1038/sj.onc.1203972 | issue=53}}</ref> It is surprising that although trastuzumab has great affinity for HER2 and high doses can be administered (because of its low toxicity), 70% of HER2+ patients do not respond to treatment.

===Duration of treatment===
The optimal duration of add-on trastuzumab is currently unknown. One year of treatment is generally accepted based on current clinical trial evidence that demonstrated the superiority of one-year treatment over none.<ref name="Romond">{{cite journal | first=EH | last=Romond |author2=Perez EA |author3=Bryant J |title=Trastuzumab plus adjuvant chemotherapy for operable HER2-positive breast cancer | journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine]] | year=2005 | volume=353 | pages=1673–1684 | pmid=16236738 | doi=10.1056/NEJMoa052122 |issue=16|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref name="Piccart">{{cite journal | first=MJ | last=Piccart-Gebhart MJ |author2=Procter M |author3=Leyland-Jones B | title=Trastuzumab after adjuvant chemotherapy in HER2-positive breast cancer |journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine]] | year=2005 | volume=353 | pages=1659–1672 | pmid=16236737 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa052306 | issue=16|display-authors=etal}}</ref> However, a small Finnish trial also showed similar improvement with nine weeks of treatment over no therapy.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Joensuu H, Kellokumpu-Lehtinen PL, Bono P, etal |title=Adjuvant docetaxel or vinorelbine with or without trastuzumab for breast cancer |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=354 |issue=8|pages=809–20 |year=2006 |pmid=16495393|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa053028}}</ref> Because of the lack of direct head-to-head comparison in clinical trials, it is unknown whether a shorter duration of treatment may be just as effective (with fewer side effects) than the currently accepted practice of treatment for one year.  Debate about treatment duration has become a relevant issue for many public health policy makers because administering trastuzumab for a year is very expensive.  Consequently, some countries with a taxpayer-funded public health system, such as New Zealand, chose to fund limited adjuvant therapy.<ref name="Metcalfe">{{cite journal | first=S | last=Metcalfe|author2=Evans J |author3=Priest G.  | title=PHARMAC funding of 9-week concurrent trastuzumab (Herceptin) for HER2-positive early breast cancer | journal=[[N Z Med J]] | year=2007 | volume=120| pages=1U2593 | pmid=17589560 | issue=1256 }}</ref>  However, subsequently New Zealand has revised its policy and now funds trastuzumab treatment for up to 12 months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/12-month-herceptin-treatment-now-available |title=12-month Herceptin treatment now available |publisher=New Zealand Government |accessdate=2 May 2017}}</ref> Clinical trial data from Roche show that one year of therapy balances efficacy against adverse side effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roche.com/investors/ir_update/inv-update-2012-10-01.htm |title=Final analysis of Phase III HERA trial confirmed one year of Herceptin treatment as standard of care in early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer |publisher=Roche |accessdate=2013-01-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esmo.org/events/vienna-2012-congress/congress-news/view.html?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=1673 |title=View - European Society for Medical Oncology |publisher=ESMO |accessdate=2013-01-06}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==

Some of the common side effects of trastuzumab are flu-like symptoms (such as fever, chills and mild pain), [[nausea]] and [[diarrhea]].<ref name="Breast Cancer Care">{{cite web|title=Breast Cancer Care Trastuzumab factsheet|url=http://www2.breastcancercare.org.uk/sites/default/files/bcc41_trastuzumab_2011.pdf|publisher=Breast Cancer Care|accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref>

One of the more serious complications of trastuzumab is its effect on the heart, although this is rare.<ref name="Breast Cancer Care"/> In 2-7% of cases <ref>{{cite journal|doi= 10.1200/JCO.20.5.1215|author= Seidman, A|title=Cardiac Dysfunction in the Trastuzumab Clinical Trials Experience |journal= Journal of Clinical Oncology|volume=20|pages=1215–1221|year=2002 |pmid=11870163|issue= 5|display-authors=etal}}</ref>, trastuzumab is associated with cardiac dysfunction, which includes [[congestive heart failure]]. As a result, regular cardiac screening with either a [[MUGA scan]] or [[echocardiography]] is commonly undertaken during the trastuzumab treatment period. The decline in ejection fraction appears to be reversible.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis of trastuzumab-associated cardiotoxicity|volume=90|issue=1|pages=126–32|year=2011|author=van Hasselt|journal=Clin Pharmacol Ther|pmid=21633346|doi=10.1038/clpt.2011.74|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

Trastuzumab downregulates neuregulin-1 (NRG-1), which is essential for the activation of cell survival pathways in cardiomyocytes and the maintenance of cardiac function. NRG-1 activates the MAPK pathway and the PI3K/AKT pathway as well as focal adhesion kinases (FAK). These are all significant for the function and structure of cardiomyocytes. Trastuzumab can therefore lead to cardiac dysfunction.<ref>Zeglinski, M., Ludke, A., Jassal, D. S. & Singal, P. K. Trastuzumab-induced cardiac dysfunction: A 'dual-hit'. Exp. Clin. Cardiol. 16, 70-74 (2011)</ref>

Approximately 10% of people are unable to tolerate the drug because of pre-existing heart problems; physicians are balancing the risk of recurrent cancer against the higher risk of death due to cardiac disease in this population.  The risk of [[cardiomyopathy]] is increased when trastuzumab is combined with [[anthracycline]] chemotherapy (which itself is associated with cardiac toxicity).

=== Birth control ===
Women having periods (or whose periods stopped due to chemotherapy) may need to use barrier contraception (such as [[condom]]s) while taking trastuzumab, and for at least six months afterwards. This is because of the possibility of harming a developing foetus.<ref>{{cite web|title=Breast Cancer Care Trastuzumab factsheet|url=http://www2.breastcancercare.org.uk/sites/default/files/bcc41_trastuzumab_2011.pdf|accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
{{Cleanup section|reason=Capitalization, syntax and tone.|date=October 2016}}

The ''HER2'' gene (also known as ''HER2/neu'' and ''ErbB2'' gene) is amplified in 20–30% of early-stage [[breast cancer]]s<ref name="Le_2005" /> Trastuzumab activates p27 by simultaneously inhibiting [[PI3K]]/[[Akt]], Mirk and hKIS pathways,<ref name="Le_2005" /> which makes it overexpress [[epidermal growth factor]] (EGF) receptors in the cell membrane.<ref name="Bange">{{cite journal | first=J | last=Bange |author2=Zwick E |author3=Ullrich A.  | title=Molecular targets for breast cancer therapy and prevention | journal=Nature Medicine | year=2001 | volume=7 |pages=548–552 | pmid=11329054 | doi=10.1038/87872 | issue=5}}</ref> In some types of cancer, HER2 may send signals despite the absence of growth factors arriving and binding to the receptor, making its effect in the cell constitutive; however, trastuzumab is not effective in this case.

The HER2 pathway promotes cell growth and division when it is functioning normally; however, when it is overexpressed, cell growth accelerates beyond its normal limits. In some types of cancer, the pathway is exploited to promote rapid cell growth and proliferation and hence tumor formation.<ref name="cancer">{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/understandingcancer/targetedtherapies/breastcancer_htmlcourse/page3|title=Targeted Therapies for Breast Cancer Tutorial|work=National Cancer Institute|accessdate=19 April 2011}}</ref>  The EGF pathway includes the receptors [[HER1]] (EGFR), HER2, HER3, and HER4; the binding of EGF to HER is required to activate the pathway.<ref name="cancer" />  The pathway initiates the [[Mitogen-activated protein kinase|MAP kinase]] pathway as well as the PI3 kinase/AKT pathway, which in turn activates the NF-κB pathway.<ref name="Feldman">{{cite journal|last=Feldman|first=A M|author2=Koch, W J |author3=Force, T L |title=Developing Strategies to Link Basic Cardiovascular Sciences with Clinical Drug Development: Another Opportunity for Translational Sciences|journal=Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics|date=28 March 2007|volume=81|issue=6|pages=887–892|doi=10.1038/sj.clpt.6100160}}</ref>  In cancer cells the HER2 protein can be expressed up to 100 times more than in normal cells (2 million versus 20,000 per cell).<ref>{{cite web|last=Winer|first=Eric|title=HER2 Disease in the Metastatic and Adjuvant Settings|url=http://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/557474|work=Medscape Education|accessdate=20 April 2011}}</ref>  This overexpression leads to strong and constant proliferative signaling and hence tumor formation. Overexpression of HER2 also causes deactivation of checkpoints, allowing for even greater increases in proliferation.

The HER receptors are proteins that are embedded in the cell membrane and communicate molecular signals from outside the cell (molecules called [[Epidermal growth factor|EGFs]]) to inside the cell, and turn genes on and off. The [[HER2/neu|HER]] (human epidermal growth factor receptor) protein, binds to human epidermal growth factor, and stimulates cell proliferation. In some cancers, notably certain types of breast cancer, HER2 is over-expressed and causes cancer cells to reproduce uncontrollably.<ref name="Hudis_2007">{{cite journal | first=CA | last=Hudis | title=Trastuzumab--mechanism of action and use in clinical practice | journal=N Engl J Med. | year=2007 | pmid=17611206 | volume=357 | issue=1 | pages=39–51 | doi=10.1056/NEJMra043186 }}</ref>

HER2 extends across the cell membrane, and carries signals from outside the cell to the inside. Signaling compounds called [[mitogens]] (specifically EGF in this case) arrive at the cell membrane, and bind to the extracellular domain of the HER family of receptors. Those bound proteins then link ([[protein dimer|dimerize]]), activating the receptor. HER2 sends a signal from its intracellular domain, activating several different biochemical pathways. These include the [[PI3K]]/[[AKT|Akt]] pathway and the [[Mitogen-activated protein kinase|MAPK]] pathway. Signals on these pathways promote cell proliferation and the growth of blood vessels to nourish the tumor ([[angiogenesis]]).<ref name="Menard">{{cite journal | first=S | last=Ménard |author2=Pupa SM |author3=Campiglio M |author4=Tagliabue E  | title=Biologic and therapeutic role of HER2 in cancer | journal=Oncogene | year=2003 | volume=22 | pages=6570–6578 | pmid=14528282 | doi=10.1038/sj.onc.1206779 | issue=42}}</ref>

Normal cell division — [[mitosis]] — has checkpoints that keep cell division under control. Some of the proteins that control this cycle are called [[Cyclin-dependent kinases|cdk2]] (CDKs). Overexpression of HER2 sidesteps these checkpoints, causing cells to proliferate in an uncontrolled fashion.<ref name="Kute">{{cite journal | first=T | last=Kute |author2=Lack CM |author3=Willingham M |author4=Bishwokama B |author5=Williams H |author6=Barrett K |author7=Mitchell T |author8=Vaughn JP  | title=Development of Herceptin resistance in breast cancer cells | journal=Cytometry | year=2004 | volume=57A | pages=86–93 | pmid=14750129 | doi=10.1002/cyto.a.10095 | issue=2}}</ref> This is caused by phosphorylation by Akt.

Trastuzumab binds to domain IV of the<ref>http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v421/n6924/full/nature01392.html</ref> extracellular segment of the HER2/neu receptor. Cells treated with trastuzumab undergo arrest during the G1 phase of the [[cell cycle]] so there is reduced proliferation. It has been suggested that trastuzumab does not alter HER-2 expression, but downregulates activation of AKT.<ref name="Kute"/> In addition, trastuzumab suppresses [[angiogenesis]] both by induction of antiangiogenic factors and repression of proangiogenic factors. It is thought that a contribution to the unregulated growth observed in cancer could be due to proteolytic cleavage of HER2/neu that results in the release of the extracellular domain. One of the most relevant proteins that trastuzumab activates is the tumor suppressor p27 (kip1), also known as [[CDKN1B]].<ref name="Le_2005"/> Trastuzumab has been shown to inhibit HER2/neu ectodomain cleavage in breast cancer cells.<ref name="Albenall">{{cite journal | first=J | last=Albanell |author2=Codony J |author3=Rovira A |author4=Mellado B |author5=Gascon P.  | title=Mechanism of action of anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies: scientific update on trastuzumab and 2C4 | journal=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology | year=2003 | volume=532 | pages=253–268 | pmid=12908564 | doi=10.1007/978-1-4615-0081-0_21 | series=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology | isbn=978-0-306-47762-1}}</ref>

Experiments in laboratory animals indicate that antibodies, including trastuzumab, when bound to a cell, induce immune cells to kill that cell, and that such [[antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity]] is another important mechanism of action.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Inhibitory Fc receptors modulate in vivo cytoxicity against tumor targets | last1=Clynes | first1=RA | last2=Towers |first2=TL | last3=Presta | first3=LG | last4=Ravetch | first4=JV | journal=Nat Med | year=2000 | volume=6 | issue=4 | pages=443–6 | pmid=10742152 | doi=10.1038/74704}}</ref>

There may be other undiscovered mechanisms by which trastuzumab induces regression in cancer.

==Predicting response==
Trastuzumab inhibits the effects of overexpression of HER2. If the breast cancer does not overexpress HER2, trastuzumab will have no beneficial effect (and may cause harm).  Doctors use laboratory tests to discover whether HER2 is overexpressed. In the routine [[clinical laboratory]], the most commonly employed methods for this are [[immunohistochemistry]] (IHC) and either silver, chromogenic or fluorescent [[in situ hybridisation]] (SISH/CISH/FISH). HER2 amplification can be detected by [[Virtual Karyotype|virtual karyotyping]] of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumor. Virtual karyotyping has the added advantage of assessing copy number changes throughout the genome, in addition to detecting HER-2 amplification (but not overexpression). Numerous [[PCR]]-based methodologies have also been described in the literature.<ref name="Jennings">{{cite journal | first=B | last=Jennings |author2=Hadfield JE |author3=Worsley SD |author4=Girling A |author5=Willis G.  | title=A differential PCR assay for the detection of c-erbB 2 amplification used in a prospective study of breast cancer. | journal=Molecular Pathology | year=1997 | volume=50 |pages=254–256 | pmid=9497915 | doi=10.1136/mp.50.5.254 | issue=5 | pmc=379641}}</ref> It is also possible to estimate ''HER2'' copy number from microarray data.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Curtis|first1=C|last2=Shah|first2=SP|last3=Chin|first3=SF|last4=Turashvili|first4=G|last5=Rueda|first5=OM|last6=Dunning|first6=MJ|last7=Speed|first7=D|last8=Lynch|first8=AG|last9=Samarajiwa|first9=S|last10=Yuan|first10=Y|last11=Gräf|first11=S|last12=Ha|first12=G|last13=Haffari|first13=G|last14=Bashashati|first14=A|last15=Russell|first15=R|last16=McKinney|first16=S|last17=METABRIC|first17=Group|last18=Langerød|first18=A|last19=Green|first19=A|last20=Provenzano|first20=E|last21=Wishart|first21=G|last22=Pinder|first22=S|last23=Watson|first23=P|last24=Markowetz|first24=F|last25=Murphy|first25=L|last26=Ellis|first26=I|last27=Purushotham|first27=A|last28=Børresen-Dale|first28=AL|last29=Brenton|first29=JD|last30=Tavaré|first30=S|last31=Caldas|first31=C|last32=Aparicio|first32=S|title=The genomic and transcriptomic architecture of 2,000 breast tumours reveals novel subgroups.|journal=Nature|date=18 April 2012|volume=486|issue=7403|pages=346–52|pmid=22522925|doi=10.1038/nature10983|pmc=3440846}}</ref>

The presence of cytoplasmic expression is disregarded. Treatment with trastuzumab is indicated in cases where HER2 expression has a score of 3+. However, IHC has been shown to have numerous limitations, both technical and interpretative, which have been found to impact on the reproducibility and accuracy of results, especially when compared with ISH methodologies. It is also true, however, that some reports have stated that IHC provides excellent correlation between gene copy number and protein expression.

[[Fluorescent in situ hybridization]] (FISH) is viewed as being the “gold standard” technique in identifying patients who would benefit from trastuzumab, but it is expensive and requires fluorescence microscopy and an image capture system. The main expense involved with CISH is in the purchase of FDA-approved kits, and as it is not a fluorescent technique it does not require specialist microscopy and slides may be kept permanently. Comparative studies of CISH and FISH have shown that these two techniques show excellent correlation. The lack of a separate chromosome 17 probe on the same section is an issue with regards to acceptance of CISH.  As of June 2011 Roche has obtained FDA approval for the INFORM HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe cocktail <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bioportfolio.com/news/article/711287/Ventana-Medical-Systems-Inc-Receives-Fda-Approval-For-The-First-Fully-Automated.html |title=Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. Receives FDA Approval for the First Fully Automated Diagnostic Assay for HER2 Gene Status Determination in Breast Cancer Patients |publisher=BioPortfolio.com |date=2011-06-14 |accessdate=2013-01-06}}</ref> developed by [[Ventana Medical Systems]].<ref name="ventanamed1"/>  The DDISH (Dual-chromagen/Dual-hapten In-situ hybridization) cocktail uses both HER2 and Chromosome 17 hybridization probes for chromagenic visualization on the same tissue section.  The detection can be achieved by using a combination of ultraView SISH(silver in-situ hybridization) and ultraView Red ISH for deposition of distinct chromgenic precipitates at the site of DNP or DIG labeled probes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asco.org/ascov2/Meetings/Abstracts?&vmview=abst_detail_view&confID=70&abstractID=40271 |title=Dual color dual hapten HER2 genotyping for breast biopsy specimens (DDISH): Concordance with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) |publisher=ASCO |date=2009-10-06 |accessdate=2013-01-06}}</ref>

Currently the recommended assays are a combination of IHC and FISH, whereby IHC scores of 0 and 1+ are negative (no trastuzumab treatment), scores of 3+ are positive (trastuzumab treatment), and score of 2+ (equivocal case) is referred to FISH for a definitive treatment decision. Industry best practices indicate the use of FDA-cleared [[Automated Tissue Image Systems]] by laboratories for automated processing of specimens, thereby reducing process variability, avoiding equivocal cases, and ensuring maximum efficacy of trastuzumab therapy.

== Resistance ==
One of the challenges in the treatment of breast cancer patients  by herceptin is our understanding towards herceptin resistance.  In the last decade, several assays have been performed to understand the mechanism of Herceptin resistance with/without supplementary drugs. Recently, all this information has been collected and compiled in form of a database HerceptinR.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2014/140327/srep04483/full/srep04483.html |title= Herceptin Resistance Database for Understanding Mechanism of Resistance in Breast Cancer Patients|author=Ahmad S|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|year=2014|volume=4 }}</ref> This database [http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/herceptinr/ HerceptinR] is a collection of assays performed to test sensitivity or resistance of Herceptin Antibodies towards breast cancer cell lines. This database provides comprehensive information about experimental data perform to understanding factors behind herceptin resistance as well as assays performed for improving Herceptin sensitivity with the help of supplementary drugs. This is the first database developed to understand herceptin resistance that can be used for designing herceptin sensitive biomarkers.

==History==
The drug was first discovered by scientists including Dr. [[Axel Ullrich]] and Dr. [[H. Michael Shepard]] at [[UCLA]]'s  [[Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.ucla.edu/ |title=cancer.ucla.edu |publisher=cancer.ucla.edu |accessdate=2013-06-16}}</ref> Dr. [[Dennis Slamon]] subsequently worked on trastuzumab's development. A book about Dr. Slamon's work was made into a television film called ''[[Living Proof (film)|Living Proof]]'', that premiered in 2008. [[Genentech]] developed trastuzumab jointly with [[UCLA]], beginning the first clinical trial with 15 women in 1992.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gene.com/media/press-releases/4763/1998-09-25/biotechnology-breakthrough-in-breast-can |title=Biotechnology Breakthrough In Breast Cancer Wins FDA Approval |publisher=[[Genentech]] |date=1998-09-25 |accessdate=2016-05-30 }}</ref> By 1996, clinical trials had expanded to over 900 women, but due to pressure from advocates based on early success, Genentech worked with the FDA to begin a lottery system allowing 100 women each quarter access to the medication outside the trials.<ref>{{cite web |title=Drug Is Shown to Shrink Tumors in Breast Cancer Characterized by Gene Defect |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/18/us/drug-is-shown-to-shrink-tumors-in-breast-cancer-characterized-by-gene-defect.html?pagewanted=all |publisher=[[New York Times]] |author=Altman, Lawrence |accessdate=2016-05-30 |date=1998-05-18}}</ref> Herceptin was [[Fast track (FDA)|Fast-tracked]] by the FDA and gained approval in September 1998.

Biocon Ltd and its partner Mylan obtained regulatory approval to sell a biosimilar in 2014 but Roche contested the legality of the approval; that litigation ended in 2016 and Biocon and Mylan each introduced their own branded biosimilars there.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Palmer|first1=Eric|title=Mylan and Biocon finally win right to sell Herceptin biosim in India even as they have taken it to U.S. and EU|url=http://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/mylan-and-biocon-finally-win-right-to-sell-herceptin-biosim-india-even-as-they-have-taken-it|work=FiercePharma|date=March 3, 2017|language=en}}</ref>

==Society and culture==
===Costs===
Trastuzumab costs about US$70,000 for a full course of treatment,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Fleck L | title = The costs of caring: Who pays? Who profits? Who panders? | journal = Hastings Cent Rep | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 13–7 | year = 2006| pmid = 16776017 | doi = 10.1353/hcr.2006.0040}}</ref> Trastuzumab brought in $327 million in revenue for Genentech in the fourth quarter of 2007.

Australia has negotiated a lower price of A$50,000 per course of treatment.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = Australian Government, Dept of Health and Ageing | title = Listing of Herceptin on PBS | date=2006-10-01 | url = http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/herceptin-govtdecision.htm}}</ref>

Since October 2006 trastuzumab has been made available for Australian women and men with early stage breast cancer via the [[Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme]].  This is estimated to cost the country over A$470 million for 4–5 years supply of the drug.<ref>Australian Government, Dept of Health and Ageing "Listing of Herceptin on PBS", 2006-10-1. http://www.pbs.gov.au/info/news/2006/10/listing-of-herceptin</ref>

Roche has agreed with [[Emcure]] in India to make an affordable version of this cancer drug available to the Indian market.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-03-02/news/31117087_1_emcure-pharmaceuticals-anti-hiv-drugs-emcure-signs-deal | work=The Times Of India | title=Emcure signs deal to manufacture Roche's anti-cancer drugs | date=2012-03-02}}</ref>

Roche has changed the trade name of the drug and has re-introduced an affordable version of the same in the Indian market. The new drug named Herclon would cost approximately RS 75,000 INR ($1,200 USD) [per month? {{clarify|date=August 2017}}] in the Indian market.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

On September 16, 2014 Genentech notified hospitals that as of October, trastuzumab could only by purchased through their selected [[specialty drugs]] distributors not through the usual general line wholesalers. By being forced to purchase through specialty pharmacies, hospitals will lose rebates from the big wholesalers and the ability to negotiate cost-minus discounts with their wholesalers.<ref name="Time_2014">{{cite web | url=http://time.com/3541484/cancer-drug-price-hikes/ | title=Hospitals Furious at Cancer-Drug Price Hikes | work=Time | date=27 October 2014 | accessdate=26 October 2015 | author=Saporito, Bill}}</ref>

====Biosimilars====
Around 20 companies worldwide, particularly from [[emerging market]]s, are developing [[biosimilar]] versions of the drug 'Herceptin' after Roche/Genentech's patents expired in 2014 in Europe, and in 2019 in the United States.<ref>Cynthia A. Challener (Apr 01, 2014). [http://www.biopharminternational.com/monoclonal-antibodies-key-unlocking-biosimilars-market Monoclonal Antibodies Key to Unlocking the Biosimilars Market]. ''BioPharm international.com'' ''27'' (4).</ref> In 2013, Roche/Genentech relinquished its patent right for the drug in India because of the difficult IP environment there. In the same year, the first biosimilar version of the drug, developed by Biocon and Mylan, received market authorization. In January 2015, BIOCAD announced the first trastuzumab biosimilar approved by the [[Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation]]. Iran also approved its own version of the monoclonal antibody in January 2016, and announced its readiness to export the drug to other countries in the Middle-East and Central Asia when [[Sanctions against Iran|trade sanctions]] were lifted.<ref name=generic/><ref>Dominik Feldges (Febr. 2016).
