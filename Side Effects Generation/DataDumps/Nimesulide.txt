'''Nimesulide''' is a [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] (NSAID) with [[analgesic|pain medication]] and [[antipyretic|fever reducing]] properties. Its approved indications are the [[Pharmacotherapy|treatment]] of acute pain, the symptomatic treatment of [[osteoarthritis]], and primary [[dysmenorrhoea]] in [[Adolescence|adolescents]] and adults above 12 years old. It has a multifactorial mode of action and is characterized by a fast onset of action.

It works by blocking the production of prostaglandins (a chemical associated with pain), thereby relieving pain and inflammation.

==Medical uses==
* Nimesulide is similar in gastrointestinal safety to other NSAIDs.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}
* It may be taken through prescription in the treatment of acute (short term) pain, and primary dysmenorrhea (period pains). Nimesulide should never be taken long-term, as for chronic conditions such as arthritis. This is due to its association with an increased risk of liver toxicity, including fulminant hepatic failure.<ref>{{cite web|title=Current status: European Commission final decision|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/referrals/Nimesulide/human_referral_000275.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac0580024e9a|accessdate=12 November 2014}}</ref>

==Side effects==
Continuous use of nimesulide (more than 15 days) may cause the following side effects:{{medcn|date=June 2014}}
* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Skin rash
* Itchiness
* Dizziness
* Bitterness in mouth
Women should use the drug with caution during lactation; Nimesulide is contraindicated during pregnancy.<ref>http://www.pharmaceutical-drug-manufacturers.com/pharmaceutical-drugs/nimesulide.html</ref>

Due to concerns about the risk of [[hepatotoxicity]], nimesulide has been withdrawn from market in several countries (Spain, Finland, Belgium, and Ireland).<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = McNaughton | first1 = R. | last2 = Huet | first2 = G. | last3 = Shakir | first3 = S. | title = An investigation into drug products withdrawn from the EU market between 2002 and 2011 for safety reasons and the evidence used to support the decision-making. | journal = [[BMJ Open]] | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = e004221 | month = | year = 2014 | doi = 10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004221 | PMID = 24435895|url = http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/4/1/e004221.full | pmc=3902466}} {{open access}}</ref>

==Pharmacokinetics==

Nimesulide is absorbed rapidly following oral administration.<ref name="clinpharmacokinet">{{cite journal |author=Bernareggi A |title=Clinical pharmacokinetics of nimesulide |journal=Clin Pharmacokinet |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=247–74 |date=October 1998 |pmid=9812177 |url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?issn=0312-5963&volume=35&issue=4&spage=247 |doi=10.2165/00003088-199835040-00001}}</ref>

Nimesulide undergoes extensive biotransformation, mainly to 4-hydroxynimesulide (which also appears to be biologically active).<ref name="clinpharmacokinet"/>

Food, gender, and advanced age have negligible effects on nimesulide pharmacokinetics.<ref name="clinpharmacokinet"/>

Moderate renal impairment does not necessitate dosage adjustment, while in patients with severe renal impairment or hepatic impairment, Nimesulide is contraindicated.<ref>[http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/referral/nimesulide/308603en.pdf Microsoft Word - opnh.P.Nimesulide .EMEA-CPMP-3086-03-en-Final.doc<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Nimesulide has a relatively rapid onset of action, with meaningful reductions in pain and inflammation observed within 15 minutes from drug intake.<ref name="currmedresopin">{{cite journal |author=Rainsford KD |title=Nimesulide – a multifactorial approach to inflammation and pain: scientific and clinical consensus |journal=Curr Med Res Opin |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=1161–70 |date=June 2006 |pmid=16846549 |doi=10.1185/030079906X104849 |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1185/030079906X104849}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bianchi M, Broggini M |title=A randomised, double-blind, clinical trial comparing the efficacy of nimesulide, celecoxib and rofecoxib in osteoarthritis of the knee |journal=Drugs |volume=63 |issue=Suppl 1|pages=37–46 |year=2003 |pmid=14506910 |url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?issn=0012-6667&volume=63&issue=&spage=37 |doi=10.2165/00003495-200363001-00006}}</ref>

The therapeutic effects of Nimesulide are the result of its complex mode of action, which targets a number of key mediators of the inflammatory process such as: COX-2 mediated prostaglandins, free radicals, proteolytic enzymes, and histamine.<ref name="currmedresopin"/>

==History==
It was launched in [[Italy]] for the first time as Aulin and Mesulid in 1985 and is available in more than 50 countries worldwide, including among others [[France]], [[Portugal]], [[Greece]], [[Switzerland]], [[Belgium]], [[Russia]], [[Thailand]], and [[Brazil]].<ref>{{cite book |author= K.D. Rainsford (red.) |title= Nimesulide – Actions and Uses|url= |location= Bazylea, Boston, Berlin|publisher= Birkhäuser Verlag|page= 7|date=2005|isbn= 978-3-7643-7068-8| access-date= }}</ref> Nimesulide has never been filed for [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) evaluation in the [[United States]], where it is not marketed.

==Availability==
[[File:Nimesulida100mg.jpg|left|thumb|100mg Nimesulide pills]]
It is available in a variety of forms: tablets, powder for dissolution in water, suppositories, mouth dissolving tablets, and topical gel.

A recent evaluation from the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) concluded that the overall benefit/risk profile of nimesulide is favourable and in line with that of the other NSAIDs such as [[diclofenac]], [[ibuprofen]], and [[naproxen]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

=== EMA confirms the positive benefit/risk ratio ===
On September 21, 2007 the EMA released a press release on their review on the liver-related safety of nimesulide. The EMA has concluded that the benefits of these medicines outweigh their risks, but that there is a need to limit the duration of use to ensure that the risk of patients developing liver problems is kept to a minimum. Therefore, the EMA has limited the use of systemic formulations (tablets, solutions, suppositories) of nimesulide to 15 days.<ref>[http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/general/direct/pr/43260407en.pdf EMA press release on nimesulide September 2007]</ref>

=== Irish Medicines Board ===

The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) has decided to suspend Nimesulide from the Irish market and refer it to the EU Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) for a review of its benefit/risk profile. The decision is due to the reporting of six (6) cases of potentially-related liver failures to the IMB by the National Liver Transplant Unit, St. Vincent Hospital. These cases occurred in the period from 1999 to 2006.<ref>[http://www.imb.ie/safety.asp?nav=70&action=view&safety_item_id=64 IMB Announces Immediate Suspension of the Marketing of Medicines Containing Nimesulide]</ref>

===Bribes ===
In May 2008, Italy's leading daily paper ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' and other media outlets{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} reported that a top-ranking official at Italy's medicines agency AIFA had been filmed by police while accepting bribes from employees of pharmaceutical companies.<ref>[http://www.corriere.it/cronache/08_maggio_23/aulin_mazzette_controlli_torino_2eed67d6-288a-11dd-97ea-00144f02aabc.shtml «Mazzette per evitare i controlli sull'Aulin».

''Manufacturing Chemist'']</ref>  The money allegedly was being paid to ensure that certain drugs would be spared scrutiny from the drugs watchdog. The investigation had started in 2005 following suspicions that some AIFA drug tests had been faked. Eight arrests were made. Nimesulide can be bought carrying a prescription from a physician that is kept as a receipt at the chemist shop, nominally allowing strong control over selling.

The original manufacturer of Nimesulide is [[Helsinn Healthcare SA]], Switzerland, which acquired the rights for the drug in 1976. After the patent protection terminated, a number of other companies started production and marketing of Nimesulide.
