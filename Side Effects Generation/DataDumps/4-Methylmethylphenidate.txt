'''''threo''-4-Methylmethylphenidate''' ('''4-MeTMP''') is a [[stimulant]] drug related to [[methylphenidate]]. It is slightly less potent than methylphenidate and has relatively low efficacy at blocking [[dopamine]] [[reuptake]] despite its high [[Dissociation constant#Protein-ligand binding|binding affinity]], which led to its investigation as a possible substitute drug for treatment of stimulant abuse (cf. [[nocaine]]).<ref>{{Cite journal
