'''Gatifloxacin''' sold under the brand names '''Gatiflo''', '''Tequin''' and '''Zymar''', is an [[antibiotic]] of the fourth-generation [[fluoroquinolone]] family,<ref name="pmid15953577">{{cite journal |vauthors=Burka JM, Bower KS, Vanroekel RC, Stutzman RD, Kuzmowych CP, Howard RS |title=The effect of fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin on epithelial healing following photorefractive keratectomy |journal=Am.

[[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] introduced Gatifloxacin in 1999 under the [[proprietary name]] '''Tequin''' for the treatment of respiratory tract infections, having licensed the medication from [[Kyorin Pharmaceutical Company]] of Japan. Allergan produces it in eye-drop formulation under the names '''Zymar''' and '''Zymaxid'''. In many countries, gatifloxacin is also available as [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]] and in various [[aqueous solution]]s for [[intravenous therapy]].

==Availability==
Gatifloxacin is currently available in the US and Canada only as an ophthalmic solution. 
In China it is sold in tablet as well as in eye drop formulations.Ophthalmic anti-infectives are generally well tolerated. The concentration of the drug observed following oral administration of 400&nbsp;mg gatifloxacin systemically is approximately 800 times higher than that of the 0.5% Gatifloxacin eye drop. Given as an eye drop, Gatifloxacin Ophthalmic Solution 0.3% & 0.5% cause very low systemic exposures. Therefore, the systemic exposures resulting from the gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution are not likely to pose any risk for systemic toxicities.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}
