'''Policresulen''' is a topical haemostatic and [[antiseptic]]. It is indicated for common anal disorders, such as hemorrhoids, and for gynecological infections. In some countries it is marketed under the trade name '''Albothyl''' or '''Polilen''' (Taiwan) or Faktu (combination with [[Cinchocaine]]).

==Medical Uses==
Policresulen is often used for gynecological infections. While it has some controversies, it is also used to treat [[canker sore]] in some countries. It is known to have an immense pain after the application on canker sore, it is considered as a very effective treatment.

==Mechanism of Action==
The chain of Policresulen is negatively charged, making it [[acidic]]. Its [[Acid dissociation constant|pKa]] is less than 0, yet it is considered a [[weak acid]]. The mechanism of action is that normal cells are negatively charged, therefore repelling each other. However, wounded and damaged cells are positively charged, causing the Policresulen to be attracted. Policresulen works by making a slight chemical burn on the wounded area, which kills the bacteria and makes the area antiseptic.
