'''JWH-073''', a [[synthetic cannabinoid]], is an [[analgesic]] chemical from the [[naphthoylindole]] family that acts as a partial agonist at both the CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub> [[cannabinoid]] receptors. It is somewhat selective for the CB<sub>1</sub> subtype, with affinity at this subtype approximately 5x the affinity at CB<sub>2</sub>.<ref name="pmid10940540">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Aung MM, etal |title=Influence of the N-1 alkyl chain length of cannabimimetic indoles upon CB(1) and CB(2) receptor binding |journal=Drug Alcohol Depend |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=133–40 |date=August 2000 |pmid=10940540 |doi=10.1016/S0376-8716(99)00152-0 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0376871699001520 }}</ref> The abbreviation JWH stands for [[John W. Huffman]], one of the inventors of the compound.

On 20 April 2009, JWH-073 was claimed by researchers at the [[University of Freiburg]] to have been found in a "fertiliser" product called "Forest Humus", along with another synthetic cannabinoid (C8)-[[CP 47,497]].<ref>[http://www.pierre-markuse.de/2009/04/20/forest-humus-enthalt-synthetische-cannabinoide Forest Humus - Enthält synthetische Cannabinoide (in German)]</ref> These claims were confirmed in July 2009 when tests of [[Spice (drug)|Spice]] product, seized after the legal ban on [[JWH-018]] had gone into effect in Germany, were shown to contain the unregulated compound JWH-073 instead.<ref name="pmid19589652">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Lindigkeit R, etal |title=Spice: A never ending story? |journal=Forensic Science International |volume= 191|issue= 1–3|pages= 58–63|date=July 2009 |pmid=19589652 |doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2009.06.008 }}</ref>

==Pharmacology==
JWH-073 has been shown to produce behavioral effects very similar to [[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]] in animals.<ref name="DEA">{{cite web|url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drugs_concern/spice/spice_jwh073.html |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803203526/http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drugs_concern/spice/spice_jwh073.html |archivedate=August 3, 2010 }}</ref>

Its effects are produced by binding and acting as an agonist to the CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub> cannabinoid receptors. The CB<sub>1</sub> receptor is found in the brain. JWH-073 bind to CB<sub>1</sub> with a higher affinity than THC, suggesting that taking more too soon after the initial dose could lead to diminished effects. CB<sub>2</sub> is found outside the brain, mostly in the immune system. The binding with CB<sub>2</sub> receptors has been shown to be similar between JWH-073 and THC.<ref name="DEA" />

A search in the literature yielded no published studies of the effects of JWH-073 in humans, but these studies in animals suggest with high probability that JWH-073 produces effects very similar to those of THC in humans.<ref name="DEA" />

==Derivatives==
The 4'-methyl derivative of JWH-073 has been encountered as an ingredient of synthetic cannabis blends in Germany and several other European countries since 2010.<ref>[http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_132857_EN_EMCDDA-Europol%20Annual%20Report%202010A.pdf EMCDDA Annual Report 2010]</ref> The 4'-methoxy derivative JWH-080 is also known to be a potent cannabinoid agonist and has been banned in some countries, though it is unclear if it has also been used in synthetic cannabis smoking blends. <!-- The code number for 4'-methyl-JWH-073 seems likely to be JWH-121, seeing as the ''N''-propyl homologue is listed as JWH-120 and the N-pentyl homologue is the widely known JWH-122. However I cannot find JWH-121 listed in any of Huffman's published reviews, despite this compound being listed under this code number by some websites -->
