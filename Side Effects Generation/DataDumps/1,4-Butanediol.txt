'''1,4-Butanediol''', colloquially known as '''BD''', is the [[organic compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] HOCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH. It is a colorless [[viscosity|viscous]] [[liquid]].  It is one of four stable [[isomer]]s of [[butanediol]].

==Synthesis==
In its industrial [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]], [[acetylene]] reacts with two equivalents of [[formaldehyde]] to form [[1,4-Butynediol|1,4-butynediol]].  This type of acetylene-based process is illustrative of what is known as "Reppe chemistry", after German chemist [[Walter Reppe]]. [[Hydrogenation]] of 1,4-butynediol gives 1,4-butanediol. This route is used by BASF and Ashland/ISP.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} It is also manufactured on an industrial scale from [[maleic anhydride]] in the [[Davy process]], which is first converted to the methyl maleate ester, then hydrogenated. Other routes are from [[butadiene]], [[allyl acetate]] and [[succinic acid]].<ref>{{Citation | title = Ashford's Dictionary of Industrial Chemicals | edition = 3rd | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-0-9522674-3-0 | page = 1517}}</ref>

A biological route to BDO has been commerciallized that uses a genetically modified organism.<ref>http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=8067214.PN.&OS=PN/8067214&RS=PN/8067214</ref>  The [[biosynthesis]] proceeds via [[4-Hydroxybutyric acid|4-hydroxybutyrate]].

==Industrial use==
1,4-Butanediol is used industrially as a [[solvent]] and in the manufacture of some types of [[plastic]]s, elastic [[fiber]]s and [[polyurethane]]s.  In [[organic chemistry]], 1,4-butanediol is used for the synthesis of [[gamma-butyrolactone|γ-butyrolactone]] (GBL). In the presence of [[phosphoric acid]] and high temperature, it dehydrates to the important solvent [[tetrahydrofuran]].<ref name="kirk1">{{Kirk-Othmer | last1 = Karas | first1 = L. | last2 = Piel | first2 = W.

World production of 1,4-butanediol was claimed to be about one million metric tons per year and market price is about 2,000&nbsp;[[USD]] (1,600&nbsp;EUR) per ton (2005). In 2013, worldwide production was claimed to be billions of lbs (consistent with approximately one million metric tons).<ref name="ChemEngmag">{{citation|title=Commercial-scale production of bio-based BDO announced |url=http://www.chemengonline.com/commercial-scale-production-of-bio-based-bdo-announced/ |date=Feb 2013 |newspaper=Chemical Engineering |accessdate=2013-02-21 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6XHb6mfLq?url=http://www.chemengonline.com/commercial-scale-production-of-bio-based-bdo-announced/ |archivedate=2015-03-25 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref>

==Health effects and use as a drug==
[[File:Dangerous dietary supplements.gif|thumb|right|FDA warning against products containing GHB and its prodrugs, such as 1,4-butanediol.|352x352px]]
1,4-Butanediol is also used as a [[recreational drug]] known by some users as "One Comma Four", "Liquid Fantasy", "One Four Bee" or "One Four B-D-O". It exerts effects similar to [[gamma-hydroxybutyrate|γ-hydroxybutyrate]] (GHB), which is a metabolic product of 1,4-butanediol.<ref>{{citation | last1 = Satta | first1 = Rosalba | last2 = Dimitrijevic | first2 = Nikola | last3 = Manev | first3 = Hari | year = 2003 | title = ''Drosophila'' metabolize 1,4-butanediol into γ-hydroxybutyric acid in vivo | journal = Eur.

===Pharmacokinetics===
1,4-Butanediol is converted into [[Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]] by the enzymes [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] and [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]] and differing levels of these enzymes may account for differences in effects and [[side effects]] between users.<ref name="Benzer">{{citation | last1 = Benzer | first1 = Theodore I. | last2 = Cameron | first2 = Scott | last3 = Russi | first3 = Christopher Scott  | date = 8 January 2007 | title = Toxicity, Gamma-Hydroxybutyrate | url = http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic848.htm | publisher = [[eMedicine]] | accessdate = 2009-08-29}}</ref> While co-administration of [[ethanol]] and GHB already poses serious risks, co-administration of [[ethanol]] with 1,4-butanediol will interact considerably and has many other potential risks. This is because the same enzymes that are responsible for metabolizing alcohol also metabolize 1,4-butanediol so there is a strong chance of a dangerous [[drug interaction]].<ref name="Benzer"/><ref name="Poldrugo">{{citation | last1 = Poldrugo | first1 = Flavio | last2 = Snead | first2= O. Carter, III | year = 1984 | title = 1,4-butanediol, γ-hydroxybutyric acid and ethanol: Relationships and interactions | journal = Neuropharmacology | volume = 23 | pages = 109–13 | doi = 10.1016/0028-3908(84)90226-0 | pmid = 6717752}}</ref> Emergency room patients who overdose on both [[ethanol]] and 1,4-butanediol often present with symptoms of [[alcohol intoxication]] initially and as the ethanol is metabolized the 1,4-butanediol is then able to better compete for the enzyme and a second period of intoxication ensues as the 1,4-butanediol is converted into GHB.<ref name="Benzer"/>

===Pharmacodynamics===
1,4-Butanediol seems to have two types of pharmacological actions. The major psychoactive effects of 1,4-butanediol are because it is metabolized into GHB; however there is a study suggesting that 1,4-butanediol may have potential alcohol-like pharmacological effects that are not due to this conversion.<ref name="Poldrugo"/> The study arrived at this conclusion based on the finding that 1,4-butanediol co-administered with ethanol led to potentiation of some of the behavioral effects of ethanol. However, potentiation of ethanol's effects may simply be caused by competition for the [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] and [[acetaldehyde dehydrogenase]] enzymes with co-administered 1,4-butanediol. The shared metabolic rate-limiting steps thus leads to slowed metabolism and clearance for both compounds including ethanol's known toxic metabolite [[acetaldehyde]].

Another study found no effect following intracerebroventricular injection in rats of 1,4-butanediol.<ref>{{Citation | pmid = 17100847 | year = 2006 | last1 = Carter | first1 = LP | last2 = Koek | first2 = W | last3 = France | first3 = CP | title = Lack of effects of GHB precursors GBL and 1,4-BD following i.c.v. Administration in rats | volume = 24 | issue = 9 | pages = 2595–600 | doi = 10.1111/j.1460-9568.2006.05146.x | journal = The European Journal of Neuroscience}}</ref> This contradicts the hypothesis that 1,4-butanediol having inherent alcohol-like pharmacological effects.

Like [[gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]], 1,4-butanediol is only safe in small amounts. Adverse effects in higher doses include, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, sedation, vertigo, and potentially death if ingested in large amounts. Anxiolytic effects are diminished and side effects increased when used in combination with alcohol.

===Legality===
While 1,4-butanediol is not currently [[U.S. Schedules of Controlled Substances|scheduled federally in the United States]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/841|title=21 U.S. Code § 841 - Prohibited acts A|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|access-date=2016-08-02}}</ref> a number of states have classified 1,4-butanediol as a controlled substance.  Individuals have been prosecuted for 1,4-butanediol  under the [[Federal Analog Act]] as substantially similar to [[gamma-hydroxybutyrate|GHB]].<ref>USA v Washam (2002) 312 F.3d 926, 930; http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/312/926/608696/</ref> A federal case in New York in 2002 ruled that 1,4-butanediol could not be considered an [[structural analog|analog]] of GHB under federal law,<ref>http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/14b/14b_law1.shtml</ref> but that decision was later overturned by the Second Circuit.<ref>United States v. Roberts, 363 F.3d 118 (2d Cir. 2004); https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13457043198797192346&q=363+F.3d+118&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39</ref> However, a Federal District Court in Chicago ruled that 1,4-butanediol  could not be considered an analog of GHB under federal law, and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling.<ref>United States v. Turcotte, 405 F.3d 515 (7th Cir. 2005) "With specific regard to 1,4 Butanediol, the jury has returned a special verdict which states that 1,4-Butanediol is not a Schedule I Narcotic Drug Controlled Substance analogue, because 1,4-Butanediol's chemical structure is not significantly similar to the chemical structure of GHB.</ref>  In the [[United Kingdom]], 1,4-butanediol was scheduled in December 2009 (along with another GHB precursor, [[gamma-butyrolactone]]) as a [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971|Class C]] controlled substance. In Germany, the drug is not explicitly illegal, but might also be treated as illegal if used as a drug. It is controlled as a Schedule VI [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] in [[Canada]].

===2007 contamination of Bindeez toy===
{{see also|Bindeez}}
A toy called "[[Bindeez]]" ("Aqua Dots" in North America) was recalled by the distributor in November 2007 because of the presence of 1,4-butanediol. The toy consists of small beads that stick to each other by sprinkling water. 1,4-Butanediol was detected by [[GC-MS]].<ref>{{citation | last = Wang | first = Linda | date = 9 November 2007 | title = Industrial Chemical Sullies Popular Children's Toy | url = http://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/85/i46/8546news11.html | newspaper = [[Chemical & Engineering News]] | accessdate=2009-08-11}}</ref> The production plant seems to have intended to cut costs by replacing less toxic [[1,5-pentanediol]] with 1,4-butanediol. ChemNet China listed the price of 1,4 butanediol at between about US$1,350–2,800 per metric ton, while the price for 1,5-pentanediol is about US$9,700 per metric ton.<ref>{{citation | title = US mother says her son began to stumble and vomit after eating Chinese-made toy, now recalled | url = http://news.bostonherald.com/news/national/general/view.bg?articleid=1043462&srvc=next_article | publisher = Associated Press | date = 8 November 2007 | newspaper = [[Boston Herald]]}}</ref>
