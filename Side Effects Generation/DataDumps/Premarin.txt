'''Premarin''' is the [[brand name]] for an [[estrogen]] [[drug|medication]] that consists of [[conjugated estrogen]]s isolated from the [[urine]] of [[pregnant]] [[horse|mare]]s ('''pre'''gnant '''mar'''es' ur'''in'''e).<ref name="FritzSperoff2012">{{cite book|author1=Marc A.

==Side effects==
The most common [[side effect]]s associated with Premarin use are vaginal [[yeast infection]]s, [[metrorrhagia|vaginal spotting or bleeding]], [[dysmenorrhea|painful menses]], and [[cramp]]ing of the legs. While there are some contradictory data, estrogen alone does not appear to increase the risk of [[coronary heart disease]] or breast cancer, unlike the case of estrogen in combination with certain [[progestin]]s such as [[levonorgestrel]] or [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]].<ref>http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/Safety-RelatedDrugLabelingChanges/ucm121062.htm</ref>

==Pharmacology==
Premarin consists of [[conjugated equine estrogen]]s (CEEs), or, more exactly, the [[sodium]] [[salt]]s of the [[sulfate]] [[ester]]s of equine estrogens.<ref name="FritzSperoff2012" /> The exact composition of Premarin is as follows: [[estrone sulfate|sodium estrone sulfate]] (49.3%), [[equilin|sodium equilin sulfate]] (22.4%), [[sodium 17α-dihydroequilin sulfate]] (13.8%), [[alfatradiol|sodium 17α-estradiol sulfate]] (4.5%), [[sodium 8,9-dehydroestrone sulfate]] (3.5%), [[equilenin|sodium equilenin sulfate]] (2.2%), [[sodium 17β-dihydroequilin sulfate]] (1.7%), [[sodium 17α-dihydroequilenin sulfate]] (1.2%), [[estradiol|sodium 17β-estradiol sulfate]] (0.9%), [[sodium 17β-dihydroequilenin sulfate]] (0.5%), and [[sodium 8,9-dehydroestradiol sulfate]] (small amounts), as well as [[hippulin]] (also small amounts).<ref name="FritzSperoff2012" /><ref name="pmid16112947">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuhl H | title = Pharmacology of estrogens and progestogens: influence of different routes of administration | journal = Climacteric | volume = 8 Suppl 1 | issue = | pages = 3–63 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16112947 | doi = 10.1080/13697130500148875 | url = }}</ref> There are many different [[steroid]]s in Premarin, even [[androgen]]s and [[progestogen]]s, but only the above-mentioned estrogens are present in sufficient amounts to produce clinically-relevant effects.<ref name="FritzSperoff2012" />

==History==
[[Emmenin]], which was an extract of the urine of pregnant women, was the predecessor of Premarin, and [[Progynon]] was a competing product. Both of these products contained conjugated estrogens similarly to Premarin, but the composition differed. The major active ingredient of Emmenin and Progynon was [[estriol glucuronide]].

Estrone sulfate was first isolated from the urine of pregnant mares in the late 1930s by researchers in the Department of Biochemistry at [[University of Toronto]].<ref name="SchachterMarrian1938">{{cite journal|last1=Schachter|first1=B.|last2=Marrian|first2=G. F.|title=The isolation of estrone sulfate from the urine of pregnant mares|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=126|year=1938|pages=663–669}}</ref> Premarin was first introduced in 1941 by Wyeth Ayerst as a treatment for hot flushes and other symptoms of menopause; at that time, Wyeth Ayerst only had to prove its safety, and not its efficacy.<ref name=MDD>Jim Kling  October 2000 [http://pubs.acs.org/subscribe/archive/mdd/v03/i08/html/kling.html The Strange Case of Premarin] Modern Drug Discovery (3):8 46–52</ref>  In response to the 1962 [[Kefauver Harris Amendment]] the FDA had its efficacy reviewed, and in 1972 found it effective for menopausal symptoms and probably effective for osteoporosis.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/federalregister37gunit#page/n864/mode/1up Federal Register 37, July 25, 1972 pp 14826-28]</ref> The review also determined  that two estrogens—estrone sulfate and equilin sulfate—were primarily responsible for the activity of Premarin, and it laid the groundwork for Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) submissions of generic versions.<ref name=MDD/> In 1984 an NIH consensus panel found that estrogens were effective for preventing osteoporosis<ref>National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference Statement. April 2–4, 1984 [http://consensus.nih.gov/1984/1984Osteoporosis043html.htm Osteoporosis]</ref> and 1986 the FDA announced in the Federal Register that Premarin was effective for preventing osteoporosis.<ref name=Woodcock1997>Food and Drug Administration.

==Society and culture==

===Health effects===
Research starting in 1975 showed substantially increased risk of [[endometrial cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal | journal=New England Journal of Medicine| title=Increased risk of endometrial carcinoma among users of conjugated estrogens |date=4 December 1975 | author=Ziel HK, Finkle WD | volume = 293 | pages=1167–1170 | pmid=171569 | doi=10.1056/NEJM197512042932303 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| title=Exogenous estrogen and endometrial carcinoma: case-control and incidence study |date=15 March 1977  |vauthors=McDonald TW, etal | journal=American J Obstet Gynecol | volume = 127 | pages = 572–580 | pmid=190887}}</ref> Since 1976 the drug has carried a label warning about the risk.<ref name=Singer>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/13/business/13drug.html| title=Menopause, as Brought to You by Big Pharma | author=Natasha Singer and Duff Wilson | date=12 December 2009 | publisher=New York Times}}</ref> As part of the [[Women's Health Initiative]] sponsored by the [[National Institutes of Health]], a large-scale [[clinical trial]] of menopausal HRT showed that long-term use of estrogen and a progestin may increase the risk of [[stroke]]s, [[heart attack]]s, [[blood clot]]s, and breast cancer.<ref name=Brunner>{{cite journal| title=Effects of conjugated equine estrogen on health-related quality of life in postmenopausal women with hysterectomy: results from the Women's Health Initiative randomized clinical trial | author=Brunner RL et al; Womens Health Initiative Investigators | journal=Archives of Internal Medicine| volume = 165 | pages = 1976–1986 | pmid=16186467 | date=26 September 2005 | url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/165/17/1976 | issue=17 | doi=10.1001/archinte.165.17.1976 }}</ref>
Following these results, Wyeth experienced a significant decline in its sales of Premarin, Prempro (conjugated equine estrogens) and related hormones, from over $2 billion in 2002 to just over $1 billion in 2006.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Earnings Results for the 2006 Fourth Quarter and Full Year |publisher=Wyeth |url=http://www.wyeth.com/irj/servlet/prt/portal/prtroot/com.sap.km.cm.docs/wyeth_xml/home/news/announcements/1170158273391.pdf }}</ref>

===Litigation===
This drug has been the subject of litigation; more than 13,000 people have sued Wyeth between 2002 and 2009. Wyeth and Pharmacia & Upjohn prevailed in the vast majority of hormone therapy cases previously set for trial through a combination of rulings by judges, verdicts by juries, and dismissals by plaintiffs themselves.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pfizer Statement on Prempro |publisher=Indy News Channel |url=http://www.theindychannel.com/health/21716786/detail.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223141331/http://www.theindychannel.com/health/21716786/detail.html |archivedate=February 23, 2012 }}</ref> Of the company’s losses, two of the jury verdicts were reversed post-trial and others are being challenged on appeal.

===Animal welfare===
[[Animal welfare]] groups claim that animal husbandry and urine collection methods used in the production of Premarin cause undue stress and suffering to the [[Mare (horse)|mare]]s involved. Animal activists have made claims of abuses ranging from inadequate stall size, long periods of confinement, cumbersome urine collection, and continuous breeding cycles. After reaching advanced age, many of the mares are adopted for recreation use, while some are sent to feed lots for slaughter.  Despite the controversy, the USDA called the Premarin HRT industry a model of self regulation.<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3995076/ns/dateline_nbc/t/hrt-horses/#.VXHYoUYbLpo The HRT horses (NBC)]</ref>
