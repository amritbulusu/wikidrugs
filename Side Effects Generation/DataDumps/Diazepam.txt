The [[United States military]] employs a specialized diazepam preparation known as  {{Anchor|CANA}} Convulsive Antidote, Nerve Agent (CANA), which contains diazepam. One CANA kit is typically issued to service members, along with three [[Mark I NAAK]] kits, when operating in circumstances where chemical weapons in the form of [[nerve agents]] are considered a potential hazard. Both of these kits deliver drugs using [[autoinjector]]s. They are intended for use in "buddy aid" or "self aid" administration of the drugs in the field prior to [[decontamination]] and delivery of the patient to definitive medical care.<ref>[[United States Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense|U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense]], ''Medical Management of Chemical Casualties Handbook'', Third Edition (June 2000), [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], MD, pp. 118–126.</ref>

== Adverse effects ==
Adverse effects of benzodiazepines such as diazepam include anterograde amnesia and confusion (especially pronounced in higher doses) and [[sedation]]. The elderly are more prone to adverse effects of diazepam, such as confusion, amnesia, ataxia, and hangover effects, as well as falls. Long-term use of benzodiazepines such as diazepam is associated with drug tolerance, benzodiazepine dependence, and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome.<ref name="Riss-2008" /> Like other benzodiazepines, diazepam can impair short-term memory and learning of new information. While benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam can cause anterograde amnesia, they do not cause [[retrograde amnesia]]; information learned before using benzodiazepines is not impaired. Tolerance to the cognitive-impairing effects of benzodiazepines does not tend to develop with long-term use, and the elderly are more sensitive to them.<ref name="the_american_psychiatric_publishing_textbook_of_neuropsychia">{{cite book | vauthors = Yudofsky SC, Hales RE | title = The American Psychiatric Publishing Textbook of Neuropsychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences, Fifth Edition (American Psychiatric Press Textbook of Neuropsychiatry) | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=f5BEk-6yO_4C&pg=PA583 | date = 1 December 2007 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. | location = US | isbn = 978-1-58562-239-9 | pages = 583–584 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160507062907/https://books.google.com/books?id=f5BEk-6yO_4C&pg=PA583 | archivedate = 7 May 2016 | df =  }}</ref> Additionally, after cessation of benzodiazepines, cognitive deficits may persist for at least six months; it is unclear whether these impairments take longer than six months to abate or if they are permanent.

=== Tolerance and dependence ===
Diazepam, as with other [[benzodiazepine]] drugs, can cause tolerance, physical dependence, [[substance use disorder]], and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal from diazepam or other benzodiazepines often leads to withdrawal symptoms similar to those seen during barbiturate or alcohol withdrawal. The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.

Withdrawal symptoms can occur from standard dosages and also after short-term use, and can range from insomnia and anxiety to more serious symptoms, including seizures and psychosis. Withdrawal symptoms can sometimes resemble pre-existing conditions and be misdiagnosed. Diazepam may produce less intense withdrawal symptoms due to its long [[elimination half-life]].

Benzodiazepine treatment should be discontinued as soon as possible by a slow and gradual dose reduction regimen.<ref name="Riss-2008" /><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=MacKinnon GL, Parker WA | title = Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome: a literature review and evaluation | journal = The American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–33 | year = 1982 | pmid = 6133446 | doi = 10.3109/00952998209002608 }}</ref> Tolerance develops to the therapeutic effects of benzodiazepines; for example tolerance occurs to the anticonvulsant effects and as a result benzodiazepines are not generally recommended for the long-term management of epilepsy. Dose increases may overcome the effects of tolerance, but tolerance may then develop to the higher dose and adverse effects may increase. The mechanism of tolerance to benzodiazepines includes uncoupling of receptor sites, alterations in [[gene expression]], down-regulation of receptor sites, and desensitisation of receptor sites to the effect of GABA. About one-third of individuals who take benzodiazepines for longer than four weeks become dependent and experience withdrawal syndrome on cessation.<ref name="Riss-2008" />

Differences in rates of withdrawal (50–100%) vary depending on the patient sample. For example, a random sample of long-term benzodiazepine users typically finds around 50% experience few or no withdrawal symptoms, with the other 50% experiencing notable withdrawal symptoms. Certain select patient groups show a higher rate of notable withdrawal symptoms, up to 100%.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Onyett SR | title = The benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome and its management | journal = The Journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners | volume = 39 | issue = 321 | pages = 160–3 | date = April 1989 | pmid = 2576073 | pmc = 1711840 }}</ref>

Patients from the aforementioned groups should be monitored very closely during therapy for signs of abuse and development of dependence. Therapy should be discontinued if any of these signs are noted, although if dependence has developed, therapy must still be discontinued gradually to avoid severe withdrawal symptoms. Long-term therapy in these people is not recommended.<ref name="Drugs.com" /><ref name="RXL.Abuse" />

People suspected of being dependent on benzodiazepine drugs should be very gradually tapered off the drug. Withdrawals can be life-threatening, particularly when excessive doses have been taken for extended periods of time. Equal prudence should be used whether dependence has occurred in therapeutic or recreational contexts.

== Overdose ==
{{Main article|Benzodiazepine overdose}}
An individual who has consumed too much diazepam typically displays one or more of these symptoms in a period of approximately four hours immediately following a suspected overdose:<ref name="Drugs.com" /><ref name="RXL.Overdose">{{cite web| date= January 24, 2005| url= http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/diazepam_od.htm| title= Diazepam: overdose| work= Rxlist.com| publisher= RxList Inc.| accessdate= 2006-03-10| deadurl= no| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060216025309/http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/diazepam_od.htm| archivedate= February 16, 2006| df= }}</ref>

* Impaired motor functions
** Impaired reflexes
** Impaired coordination
** Impaired balance
** Dizziness
* [[Coma]]

Although not usually fatal when taken alone, a diazepam overdose is considered a medical emergency and generally requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. The [[antidote]] for an overdose of diazepam (or any other benzodiazepine) is [[flumazenil]] (Anexate). This drug is only used in cases with severe respiratory depression or cardiovascular complications. Because flumazenil is a short-acting drug, and the effects of diazepam can last for days, several doses of flumazenil may be necessary. [[Artificial respiration]] and stabilization of cardiovascular functions may also be necessary. Though not routinely indicated, [[activated charcoal]] can be used for decontamination of the stomach following a diazepam overdose. [[Emesis]] is contraindicated. [[Dialysis]] is minimally effective. Hypotension may be treated with [[levarterenol]] or [[metaraminol]].<ref name="Drugs.com" /><ref name="Inchem" /><ref name="RXL.Overdose" /><ref name="Barondes1" />

The oral {{LD50}} (lethal dose in 50% of the population) of diazepam is 720&nbsp;mg/kg in mice and 1240&nbsp;mg/kg in rats.<ref name="Drugs.com" /> D. J. Greenblatt and colleagues reported in 1978 on two patients who had taken 500 and 2000&nbsp;mg of diazepam, respectively, went into moderately deep comas, and were discharged within 48 hours without having experienced any important complications, in spite of having high concentrations of diazepam and its metabolites desmethyldiazepam, oxazepam, and temazepam, according to samples taken in the hospital and as follow-up.<ref name=Greenblatt_et_al_1978>{{cite journal |vauthors=Greenblatt DJ, Woo E, Allen MD, Orsulak PJ, Shader RI | title = Rapid recovery from massive diazepam overdose | journal = JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 240 | issue = 17 | pages = 1872–4 | date = October 1978 | pmid = 357765 | doi = 10.1001/jama.240.17.1872 }}</ref>

== Interactions ==
If diazepam is administered concomitantly with other drugs, attention should be paid to the possible pharmacological interactions. Particular care should be taken with drugs that potentiate the effects of diazepam, such as barbiturates, [[phenothiazines]], [[opioid]]s, and [[antidepressants]].<ref name="Drugs.com" />

Diazepam does not increase or decrease hepatic enzyme activity, and does not alter the metabolism of other compounds. No evidence would suggest diazepam alters its own metabolism with chronic administration.<ref name="Inchem" />

Agents with an effect on hepatic cytochrome P450 pathways or conjugation can alter the rate of diazepam metabolism. These interactions would be expected to be most significant with long-term diazepam therapy, and their clinical significance is variable.<ref name="Inchem" />
* Diazepam increases the central depressive effects of alcohol, other [[hypnotic]]s/sedatives (e.g., barbiturates), other [[muscle relaxant]]s, certain antidepressants, sedative [[antihistamines]], [[opioid]]s, and [[antipsychotics]], as well as [[anticonvulsants]] such as [[phenobarbital]], [[phenytoin]], and [[carbamazepine]].

=== Mechanism of action ===
{{See also|Benzodiazepine}}

Benzodiazepines are positive allosteric modulators of the GABA type A receptors ([[GABAA]]). The GABAA receptors are ligand-gated chloride-selective ion channels that are activated by GABA, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Binding of benzodiazepines to this receptor complex promotes binding of GABA, which in turn increases the total conduction of chloride ions across the neuronal cell membrane. This increased chloride ion influx hyperpolarizes the neuron's membrane potential. As a result, the difference between resting potential and threshold potential is increased and firing is less likely.

The GABAA receptor is a heteromer composed of five subunits, the most common ones being two αs, two βs, and one γ (α2β2γ). For each subunit, many subtypes exist (α1–6, β1–3, and γ1–3).  GABAA receptors containing the α1 subunit mediate the sedative, the anterograde amnesic, and partly the anticonvulsive effects of diazepam. GABAA receptors containing α2 mediate the anxiolytic actions and to a large degree the myorelaxant effects. GABAA receptors containing α3 and α5 also contribute to benzodiazepines myorelaxant actions, whereas GABAA receptors comprising the α5 subunit were shown to modulate the temporal and spatial memory effects of benzodiazepines.<ref>{{cite web |first1=Kelly R. |last1=Tan |first2=Uwe |last2=Rudolph |first3=Christian |last3=Lüscher |title=Hooked on benzodiazepines: GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subtypes and addiction |url=http://www.addictionscience.unige.ch/LabPublications-1/TrendsNeurosciKT2011.pdf |format=PDF |work=[[University of Geneva]] |date=2011 |accessdate=December 12, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701230113/http://www.addictionscience.unige.ch/LabPublications-1/TrendsNeurosciKT2011.pdf |archivedate=July 1, 2015 |df= }}</ref> Diazepam is not the only drug to target these GABAA receptors. Drugs like Flumazenil also bind to GABAA to induce their effects.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Whirl-Carrillo|first1=M|last2=McDonagh|first2=EM|last3=Hebert|first3=JM|last4=Gong|first4=L|last5=Sangkuhl|first5=K|last6=Thorn|first6=CF|last7=Altman|first7=RB|last8=Klein|first8=TE|title=Pharmacogenomics Knowledge for Personalized Medicine|journal=Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics|date=2012|volume=92|issue=4|pages=414–417|pmid=22992668|doi=10.1038/clpt.2012.96|pmc=3660037}}</ref>

Diazepam appears to act on areas of the [[limbic system]], [[thalamus]], and [[hypothalamus]], inducing anxiolytic effects.  Benzodiazepine drugs including diazepam increase the inhibitory processes in the cerebral cortex.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Zakusov VV, Ostrovskaya RU, Kozhechkin SN, Markovich VV, Molodavkin GM, Voronina TA | title = Further evidence for GABA-ergic mechanisms in the action of benzodiazepines | journal = Archives Internationales de Pharmacodynamie et de Thérapie | volume = 229 | issue = 2 | pages = 313–26 | date = October 1977 | pmid = 23084 }}</ref>

The anticonvulsant properties of diazepam and other benzodiazepines may be in part or entirely due to binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels rather than benzodiazepine receptors. Sustained repetitive firing seems limited by benzodiazepines' effect of slowing recovery of sodium channels from inactivation.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=McLean MJ, Macdonald RL | title = Benzodiazepines, but not beta carbolines, limit high frequency repetitive firing of action potentials of spinal cord neurons in cell culture | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 244 | issue = 2 | pages = 789–95 | date = February 1988 | pmid = 2450203 }}</ref>

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Diazepam can be administered orally, intravenously (must be diluted, as it is painful and damaging to veins), [[intramuscular injection|intramuscularly]] (IM), or as a [[suppository]].<ref name="Inchem">{{cite web | author= Pere Munne | editor= M. Ruse | year= 1998 | url= http://www.inchem.org/documents/pims/pharm/pim181.htm | title= Diazepam | work= Inchem.org | publisher= Inchem.org | accessdate= 2006-03-11 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060227195320/http://www.inchem.org/documents/pims/pharm/pim181.htm | archivedate= 2006-02-27 | df=  }}</ref>

When administered orally, it is rapidly absorbed and has a fast onset of action. The onset of action is one to five minutes for IV administration and 15–30 minutes for IM administration. The duration of diazepam's peak pharmacological effects is 15 minutes to one hour for both routes of administration.<ref name="Cuny.edu">{{cite web | author= Langsam, Yedidyah | url= http://eilat.sci.brooklyn.cuny.edu/newnyc/DRUGS/Diazepam.htm | title= DIAZEPAM (VALIUM AND OTHERS) | work=  | publisher= Brooklyn College (Eilat.sci.Brooklyn.CUNY.edu) | accessdate= 2006-03-23 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070730114031/http://eilat.sci.brooklyn.cuny.edu/newnyc/DRUGS/Diazepam.htm | archivedate= 2007-07-30 | df=  }}</ref> The bioavailability after oral administration is 100%, and 90% after rectal administration. Peak plasma levels occur between 30 and 90 minutes after oral administration and between 30 and 60 minutes after intramuscular administration; after rectal administration, peak plasma levels occur after 10 to 45 minutes. Diazepam is highly protein-bound, with 96 to 99% of the absorbed drug being protein-bound. The distribution half-life of diazepam is two to 13 minutes.<ref name="Riss-2008" />

When diazepam is administered IM, absorption is slow, erratic, and incomplete.<ref name="DrugBank">{{cite journal|title=Drug Bank – Diazepam |url=http://redpoll.pharmacy.ualberta.ca/drugbank/cgi-bin/getCard.cgi?CARD=APRD00642.txt |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061224154141/http://redpoll.pharmacy.ualberta.ca/drugbank/cgi-bin/getCard.cgi?CARD=APRD00642.txt |archivedate=December 24, 2006 }}</ref>

Diazepam is highly lipid-soluble, and is widely distributed throughout the body after administration. It easily crosses both the [[blood–brain barrier]] and the [[placenta]], and is excreted into breast milk. After absorption, diazepam is redistributed into [[muscle]] and [[adipose]] tissue. Continual daily doses of diazepam quickly build to a high concentration in the body (mainly in [[adipose tissue]]), far in excess of the actual dose for any given day.<ref name="Riss-2008" /><ref name="Inchem" />

Diazepam is stored preferentially in some organs, including the heart. Absorption by any administered route and the risk of accumulation is significantly increased in the [[neonate]], and withdrawal of diazepam during pregnancy and breast feeding is clinically justified.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Olive G, Dreux C | title = Pharmacologic bases of use of benzodiazepines in peréinatal medicine | journal = Archives Françaises De Pédiatrie | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 74–89 | date = January 1977 | pmid = 851373 }}</ref>

Diazepam undergoes oxidative metabolism by demethylation (CYP 2C9, 2C19, 2B6, 3A4, and 3A5), hydroxylation (CYP 3A4 and 2C19) and [[glucuronidation]] in the liver as part of the [[cytochrome P450]] enzyme system. It has several pharmacologically [[active metabolites]]. The main active metabolite of diazepam is [[nordiazepam|desmethyldiazepam]] (also known as nordazepam or nordiazepam). Its other active metabolites include the minor active metabolites temazepam and oxazepam. These metabolites are conjugated with glucuronide, and are excreted primarily in the urine. Because of these active metabolites, the serum values of diazepam alone are not useful in predicting the effects of the drug. Diazepam has a biphasic half-life of about one to three days, and two to seven days for the active metabolite desmethyldiazepam.<ref name="Riss-2008" />  Most of the drug is metabolised; very little diazepam is excreted unchanged.<ref name="Inchem" />  The elimination half-life of diazepam and also the active metabolite [[desmethyldiazepam]] increases significantly in the elderly, which may result in prolonged action, as well as accumulation of the drug during repeated administration.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Vozeh S | title = [Pharmacokinetic of benzodiazepines in old age] | journal = Schweizerische Medizinische Wochenschrift | volume = 111 | issue = 47 | pages = 1789–93 | date = November 21, 1981 | pmid = 6118950 }}</ref>

== Physical and chemical properties ==

Diazepam occurs as solid white or yellow crystals with a melting point of 131.5 to 134.5&nbsp;°C. It is odorless, and has a slightly bitter taste. The [[British Pharmacopoeia]] lists it as being very slightly soluble in water, soluble in alcohol, and freely soluble in chloroform. The [[United States Pharmacopoeia]] lists diazepam as soluble 1 in 16 ethyl alcohol, 1 in 2 of chloroform, 1 in 39 [[ether]], and practically insoluble in water. The [[pH]] of diazepam is neutral (i.e., pH = 7). Due to additives such as benzoic acid/benzoate in the injectable form. (Plumb's, 6th edition page 372) Diazepam has a shelf life of five years for oral tablets and three years for IV/IM solutions.<ref name="Inchem" />
Diazepam should be stored at room temperature (15–30&nbsp;°C). The solution for parenteral injection should be protected from light and kept from freezing. The oral forms should be stored in air-tight containers and protected from light.<ref name="ElephantCare">{{cite web|author1=Mikota, Susan K.|author2=Plumb, Donald C.|year=2005|url=http://www.elephantcare.org/Drugs/diazepam.htm|title=Diazepam|work=The Elephant Formulary|publisher=Elephant Care International|accessdate=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050908214617/http://www.elephantcare.org/Drugs/diazepam.htm|archivedate=2005-09-08|df=}}</ref>

Diazepam can absorb into plastics, so liquid preparations should not be kept in plastic bottles or syringes, etc. As such, it can leach into the plastic bags and tubing used for intravenous infusions. Absorption appears to depend on several factors, such as temperature, concentration, flow rates, and tube length. Diazepam should not be administered if a precipitate has formed and does not dissolve.<ref name="ElephantCare" />

=== Detection in body fluids ===
Diazepam may be quantified in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients, provide evidence in an impaired driving arrest, or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma diazepam concentrations are usually in a range of 0.1–1.0&nbsp;mg/l in persons receiving the drug therapeutically, 1–5&nbsp;mg/l in those arrested for impaired driving, and 2–20&nbsp;mg/l in victims of acute overdose. Most commercial immunoassays for the benzodiazepine class of drugs cross-react with diazepam, but confirmation and quantitation are usually performed using chromatographic techniques.<ref name="pmid17417081">{{cite journal |vauthors=Jones AW, Holmgren A, Kugelberg FC | title = Concentrations of scheduled prescription drugs in blood of impaired drivers: considerations for interpreting the results | journal = Therapeutic Drug Monitoring | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 248–60 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17417081 | doi = 10.1097/FTD.0b013e31803d3c04 }}</ref><ref name="pmid1675703">{{cite journal |vauthors=Fraser AD, Bryan W | title = Evaluation of the Abbott ADx and TDx serum benzodiazepine immunoassays for analysis of alprazolam | journal = Journal of Analytical Toxicology | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 63–5 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1675703 | doi = 10.1093/jat/15.2.63 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author = Baselt R |title=Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man |edition=9th |publisher=Biomedical Publications |location=Seal Beach, CA |year=2011 |pages=471–473 |isbn=978-0-9626523-8-7}}</ref>

== History ==
Diazepam was the second benzodiazepine invented by Dr. [[Leo Sternbach]] of [[Hoffmann-La Roche]] at the company's [[Nutley, New Jersey]], facility<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/27/business/roche-to-shut-down-former-us-headquarters-after-83-years.html |title=Roche to Shut Former U.S. Headquarters |newspaper=New York Times |last=Pollack |first=Andrew |date=June 26, 2012 |accessdate=January 10, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331200545/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/27/business/roche-to-shut-down-former-us-headquarters-after-83-years.html |archivedate=March 31, 2013 |df= }}</ref> following [[chlordiazepoxide]] (Librium), which was approved for use in 1960. Released in 1963 as an improved version of Librium, diazepam became incredibly popular, helping Roche to become a pharmaceutical industry giant. It is 2.5 times more potent than its predecessor, which it quickly surpassed in terms of sales. After this initial success, other pharmaceutical companies began to introduce other benzodiazepine derivatives.<ref name="Obituary">{{cite news| author= Sample I| title= Leo Sternbach's Obituary| date= October 3, 2005| publisher= The Guardian (Guardian Unlimited)| url= https://www.theguardian.com/medicine/story/0,,1583671,00.html| accessdate= 2006-03-10}}</ref>

The benzodiazepines gained popularity among medical professionals as an improvement over [[barbiturate]]s, which have a comparatively narrow [[therapeutic index]], and are far more sedative at therapeutic doses. The benzodiazepines are also far less dangerous; death rarely results from diazepam overdose, except in cases where it is consumed with large amounts of other [[depressants]] (such as alcohol or opioids).<ref name="Barondes1">{{cite book | author = Barondes SH | year= 2003 | title= Better Than Prozac | pages= 47–59 | location= New York | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn= 0-19-515130-5 }}</ref> Benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam initially had widespread public support, but with time the view changed to one of growing criticism and calls for restrictions on their prescription.<ref name="Marshall-2009">{{cite journal |vauthors=Marshall KP, Georgievskava Z, Georgievsky I | title = Social reactions to Valium and Prozac: a cultural lag perspective of drug diffusion and adoption | journal = Research in Social & Administrative Pharmacy : RSAP | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 94–107 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19524858 | doi = 10.1016/j.sapharm.2008.06.005 }}</ref>

Males abuse benzodiazepines as commonly as females.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.samhsa.gov/data/2k13/DAWN2k11ED/DAWN2k11ED.htm#6.1 |title=Drug Abuse Warning Network, 2011: National Estimates of Drug-Related Emergency Department Visits |accessdate=20 April 2014 |author=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration |authorlink=Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration |year=2011 |publisher=Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531024002/http://www.samhsa.gov/data/2k13/DAWN2k11ED/DAWN2k11ED.htm#6.1 |archivedate=31 May 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref>

Benzodiazepines, including diazepam, nitrazepam, and flunitrazepam, account for the largest volume of forged drug prescriptions in [[Sweden]], a total of 52% of drug forgeries being for benzodiazepines.<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Bergman U, Dahl-Puustinen ML |title=Use of prescription forgeries in a drug abuse surveillance network |journal=European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume=36 |issue=6 |pages=621–3 |year=1989 |pmid=2776820 |doi=10.1007/BF00637747}}</ref>

Diazepam was detected in 26% of cases of people suspected of [[driving under the influence]] of drugs in Sweden, and its active metabolite nordazepam was detected in 28% of cases. Other benzodiazepines and zolpidem and zopiclone also were found in high numbers. Many drivers had blood levels far exceeding the therapeutic dose range, suggesting a high degree of abuse potential for benzodiazepines and [[zolpidem]] and [[zopiclone]].<ref name="pmid17417081"/> In [[Northern Ireland]] in cases where drugs were detected in samples from impaired drivers who were not impaired by alcohol, benzodiazepines were found in 87% of cases. Diazepam was the most commonly detected benzodiazepine.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cosbey SH |title=Drugs and the impaired driver in Northern Ireland: an analytical survey |journal=Forensic Science International |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=245–58 |date=December 1986 |pmid=3804143 |doi=10.1016/0379-0738(86)90201-X}}</ref>
