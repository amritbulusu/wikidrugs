'''Melengestrol''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]]) is a [[steroid]]al [[progestin]] of the [[17α-hydroxyprogesterone]] group and an [[antineoplastic]] [[drug]] which was never marketed.<ref name="Macdonald1997">{{cite book | author = F..

While ''melengestrol'' is sometimes used as a synonym for ''melengestrol acetate'', what is usually being referred to is melengestrol acetate and not melengestrol.

==Synthesis==
6-Methyl-16-dehydropregnenolone acetate ('''5''') is the key intermediate to the preparation of both melengesterol acetate and [[medrogestone]]. Petrov and his collaborators have devised several interesting schemes that go back to [[diosgenin]] as the starting point. These schemes perform the necessary modifications in rings A and B with the sapogenin side chain still in place. In essence this approach employs this side chain as a protecting group for the future 16-dehydro-20-ketone function. In one of these routes, diosgenin is first converted to the 3-toluenesulfonate ('''1'''). Solvolysis of this homoallylic alcohol derivative affords the 3,5-cyclosteroid ('''2'''), via the cyclopropyl [[carbinyl ion]] ([[carbenium ion]]) (not shown). (This general reaction was probably first found in the steroids and bore the name of "''i''-steroid rearrangement.") Oxidation of the product by means of [[Pyridinium chlorochromate|PCC]] affords the ketone. Reaction of this with [[methylmagnesium iodide]] affords two isomeric carbinols with the α-isomer predominating ('''3'''). Solvolysis in the presence of a nucleophile such as acetic acid reverses the cyclopropylcarbinyl transformation to afford homoallylic acetate. Removal of the sapogenin side chain leads to the desired product ('''5''').<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1039/JR9570004092|title=809. Modified steroid hormones.

Substitution at the 16 position was found to lead to further potentiation of progestational activity. Reaction with [[diazomethane]] at the conjugated double bond at 16 gives first the [[pyrazole]] ('''6'''). This heterocycle affords the 16 methyl [[enone]] on [[pyrolysis]] ('''7'''). Selective [[epoxidation]] of the conjugated double bond to the 16,17α-epoxide over that at 5,6 is achieved by oxidation with basic [[hydrogen peroxide]] ('''8'''). Opening of this tetrasubstituted [[oxirane]] ring in acid proceeds with loss of a proton from the β position (16 methyl) ('''9''') to afford the desired 16-methylene-17α-hydroxy-20-ketone functionality in the D ring ('''10'''). The product is saponified and then the subject of an [[Oppenauer oxidation]], which is then dehydrogenated to the 4,6-diene with [[chloranil]] ('''11'''). Acetylation under forcing conditions completes the synthesis of melengesterol acetate.
