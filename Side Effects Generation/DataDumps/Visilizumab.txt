'''Visilizumab''' (tentative trade name '''Nuvion''', PDL BioPharma Inc.) is a [[humanized monoclonal antibody]]. It is being investigated for use as an [[immunosuppressive drug]] in patients with [[ulcerative colitis]] and [[Crohn's disease]]. Visilizumab binds to the [[CD3 (immunology)|CD3 receptor]] on certain activated [[T cell]]s without affecting resting T cells. It is currently under clinical studies for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.<ref>{{cite web

PDL BioPharma, Inc. canceled production of visilizumab following its Phase II/III [[clinical trials]], citing its inefficacy and poor safety profile compared to other drugs on the market as the major reasons.<ref>{{cite web
