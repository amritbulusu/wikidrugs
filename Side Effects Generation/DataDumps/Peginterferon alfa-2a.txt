==Medical uses==
This drug is approved around the world for the treatment of chronic [[hepatitis C]] (including people with [[HIV]] co-infection, [[cirrhosis]], 'normal' levels of [[Alanine transaminase|ALT]]) and has recently been approved (in the [[European Union|EU]], [[United States|U.S.]], [[China]] and many other countries) for the treatment of chronic [[hepatitis B]]. It is also used in the treatment of certain T-cell lymphomas, particularly [[mycosis fungoides]].

Peginterferon alfa-2a is a long acting interferon. Interferons are [[proteins]] released in the body in response to [[viral infections]]. Interferons are important for fighting [[viruses]] in the body, for regulating reproduction of [[Cell (biology)|cells]], and for regulating the immune system.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

=== Host genetic factors===

For genotype 1 hepatitis C treated with [[pegylated interferon-alpha-2a]] or [[pegylated interferon-alpha-2b]] combined with [[ribavirin]], it has been shown that genetic polymorphisms near the human IL28B gene, encoding interferon lambda 3, are associated with significant differences in response to the treatment.  This finding, originally reported in Nature,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Genetic variation in IL28B predicts hepatitis C treatment-induced viral clearance |vauthors=Ge D, Fellay J, Thompson AJ, etal |journal=Nature |year=2009 |volume=461|pages=399–401 |pmid=19684573 |doi=10.1038/nature08309|issue=7262}}</ref> showed genotype 1 hepatitis C patients carrying certain genetic variant alleles near the IL28B gene are more likely to achieve sustained virological response after the treatment than others.  Another report in Nature <ref>{{cite journal|title=Genetic variation in IL28B and spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus |vauthors=Thomas DL, Thio CL, Martin MP, etal |journal=Nature |year=2009  |pmid=19759533 |doi=10.1038/nature08463|volume=461|issue=7265|pages=798–801|pmc=3172006}}</ref> demonstrated the same genetic variants are also associated with the natural clearance of the genotype 1 hepatitis C virus.

===Other infections===
Has also been used for [[Middle East respiratory syndrome]] and [[hepatitis E]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Peginterferon Alfa Monograph for Professionals - Drugs.com|url=https://www.drugs.com/monograph/peginterferon-alfa.html|website=www.drugs.com|accessdate=12 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116185138/https://www.drugs.com/monograph/peginterferon-alfa.html|archivedate=16 January 2017|df=}}</ref>

==Manufacture==
It is [[pegylated]] with a branched 40&nbsp;kg/mol PEG chain.

==Research==
A [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane Review]] sought to determine whether interferon alfa-2a could be used as a treatment for individuals with [[macular degeneration|neovascular age-related macular degeneration]]. They found no evidence of improved visual acuity with potential harm.<ref name="Reddy">{{cite journal |vauthors= Reddy U, Krzystolik M |title= Antiangiogenic therapy with interferon alfa for neovascular age-related macular degeneration |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=1 |pages= CD005138 |date=2006 |pmid= 16437522|doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD005138.pub2}}</ref>
