'''Dexlansoprazole''' (trade names '''Kapidex''', '''Dexilant''') is a [[proton pump inhibitor]] (PPI) that is marketed by [[Takeda Pharmaceuticals]] for the treatment of [[erosive esophagitis]] and [[gastro-oesophageal reflux disease]].  It is similar in effectiveness to other  PPIs.<ref name=TI(99)2016/>

==Medical use==
Dexlansoprazole is used to heal and maintain healing of [[erosive esophagitis]] and to treat [[heartburn]] associated with [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] (GERD).<ref name=Label/>  It lasts longer than [[lansoprazole]], to which it is chemically related, and needs to be taken less often.<ref name=Behm2011/> There is not good evidence that it works better than other PPIs.<ref name=TI(99)2016>{{cite journal |journal=Therapeutics letter |publisher=[[Therapeutics Initiative]] |issue=99 |date=28 June 2016 |title=Comparative effectiveness of proton pump inhibitors |url=http://www.ti.ubc.ca/2016/06/28/99-comparative-effectiveness-proton-pump-inhibitors/ |accessdate=14 July 2016}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
The most significant adverse reactions (≥2%) reported in clinical trials were diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting, and flatulence.<ref name=Label/>

==Mechanism of action==
Like lansoprazole, dexlansoprazole permanently binds to the [[proton pump]] and blocks it, preventing the formation of [[gastric acid]].<ref name=Behm2011/>

==Chemistry==
Dexlansoprazole is the (''R'')-(+)-[[enantiomer]] of [[lansoprazole]], which is a [[racemic mixture]] of its (''R'')-(+) and (''S'')-(−)-enantiomers.<ref name=Behm2011/>  The Takeda drug has a dual release [[pharmaceutical formulation]], with two types of granules of dexlansoprazole, each with a coating that dissolves at a different [[pH]] level.<ref name=Behm2011/>

==Pharmacokinetics==
Dexlansoprazole ((''R'')-(+)-lansoprazole) has the same binding affinity to the proton pump as the (''S'')-enantiomer, but is associated with a  three- to five-fold greater [[Area under the curve (pharmacokinetics)|area under the plasma drug concentration time curve (AUC)]] compared with (''S'')-lansoprazole.<ref name=Behm2011/> With its dual release [[pharmaceutical formulation]], the first quick release produces a plasma peak concentration about one hour after application, with a second retarded release producing another peak about four hours later.<ref name=Takeda_32521>[http://www.takeda.com/press/article_32521.html FDA Approves KAPIDEX (dexlansoprazole) delayed release capsules for the Treatment of GERD]</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Metz|first=DC|date=1 May 2009|title=Review article: dual delayed release formulation of dexlansoprazole MR, a novel approach to overcome the limitations of conventional single release proton pump inhibitor therapy|journal=Aliment Pharmacol Ther|volume=29|issue=9|pages=928–37|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2036.2009.03984.x|pmid=19298580|last2=Vakily|first2=M|last3=Dixit|first3=T|last4=Mulford|first4=D}}</ref> {{as of|2009|11}}, clinical relevance of this form of release has yet to be shown.

==History==
Dexlansoprazole was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2009, and was approved in Canada in 2010 and in Mexico in 2011.<ref name=Behm2011>Behm BW, Peura DA. Dexlansoprazole MR for the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Expert Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2011 Aug;5(4):439-45. {{PMID|21780890}}</ref>

Since Kapidex was approved in 2009, there have been reports of dispensing errors because of confusion with the drugs Casodex ([[bicalutamide]]) and Kadian ([[morphine]]), which have very different uses from Kapidex and from each other.  In  2010, the FDA approved a name change for Kapidex to avoid confusion with the two other medications and Takeda began marketing it under the new name Dexilant.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.takeda.com/press/article_35868.html|title=KAPIDEX (dexlansoprazole) Renamed DEXILANT in U.S. to Avoid Name Confusion|publisher=Takeda|date=4 March 2010}}</ref>
