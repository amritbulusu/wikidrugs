'''Batimastat''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]/[[United States Adopted Name|USAN]], codenamed '''BB-94''') is an anticancer drug that belongs to the family of drugs called [[angiogenesis inhibitor]]s. It acts as a [[matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor]] (MMPI) by mimicking natural MMPI [[peptide]]s.

Batimastat was the first MMPI that went into [[clinical trial]]s. First results of a Phase I trial appeared in 1994. The drug reached Phase III but was never marketed; mainly because it couldn't be administered orally (as opposed to the newer and chemically similar MMPI [[marimastat]]), and injection into the peritoneum caused [[peritonitis]].<ref>{{Cite journal
