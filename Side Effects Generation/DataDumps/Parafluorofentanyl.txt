'''Parafluorofentanyl''' ('''4-Fluorofentanyl''') is an [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] being an [[analog (chemistry)|analogue]] of [[fentanyl]] developed by Janssen Pharmaceutica in the 1960s.<ref>{{ cite patent | country = US | status = patent | number = 3164600 }}</ref>

4-Fluorofentanyl was sold briefly on the US black market in the early 1980s,{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} before the introduction of the [[Federal Analog Act]] which for the first time attempted to control entire families of drugs based on their structural similarity rather than scheduling each drug individually as they appeared.<ref>{{ cite journal | author = Henderson, G.

Side effects of [[fentanyl]] analogs are similar to those of fentanyl itself, which include [[itching]], [[nausea]] and potentially serious [[respiratory depression]], which can be life-threatening. Fentanyl analogs have killed hundreds of people throughout Europe and the former Soviet republics since the most recent resurgence in use began in Estonia in the early 2000s, and novel derivatives continue to appear.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.ijdp.org/article/S0955-3959%2815%2900097-3/abstract | title=Fentanyls: Are we missing the signs?
