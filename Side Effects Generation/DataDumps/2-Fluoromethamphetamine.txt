'''2-Fluoromethamphetamine''' ('''2-FMA''') is a [[stimulant]] drug from the [[amphetamine]] family which has rarely been found possessed as a [[designer drug]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rösner | first1 = P | last2 = Quednow | first2 = B | last3 = Girreser | first3 = U | last4 = Junge | first4 = T | title = Isomeric fluoro-methoxy-phenylalkylamines: a new series of controlled-substance analogues (designer drugs) | journal = Forensic Science International | volume = 148 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 143–56 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15639609 | doi = 10.1016/j.forsciint.2004.05.003 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Camilleri | first1 = A | last2 = Johnston | first2 = MR | last3 = Brennan | first3 = M | last4 = Davis | first4 = S | last5 = Caldicott | first5 = DG | title = Chemical analysis of four capsules containing the controlled substance analogues 4-methylmethcathinone, 2-fluoromethamphetamine, alpha-phthalimidopropiophenone and N-ethylcathinone | journal = Forensic Science International | volume = 197 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 59–66 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20074881 | doi = 10.1016/j.forsciint.2009.12.048 }}</ref> Effects include [[euphoria]], loss of appetite, increased energy, [[insomnia]], focus enhancement, bronchodialation, motivation enhancement, and dry mouth<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-FMA|title=2-FMA|work=PsychonautWiki|access-date=2017-04-09|language=en}}</ref>. 

It is often compared by its users in anecdotal reports to [[Lisdexamfetamine]] (Vyvanse) in regards to 2-FMA's dosage, duration, and general effects profile. What is unique to 2-FMA is that even though it is chemically related to [[Methamphetamine]], it does not share the same effects profile and is more comparable to [[Dextroamphetamine]] or Lisdexamfetamine <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=104939|title=Erowid Experience Vaults: 2-Fluoromethamphetamine (2-FMA)  - A Clean Productivity Stimulant - 104939|website=www.erowid.org|access-date=2017-04-09}}</ref>. Compared against most pharmaceutical amphetamine formulations, it produces noticeably fewer physical side-effects, such as minimal nausea, negligible effects on anxiety, and lack of uncomfortable off-set of effects ('comedown).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-FMA#Subjective_effects|title=2-FMA|work=PsychonautWiki|access-date=2017-04-09|language=en}}</ref>
