'''Minoxidil''' is an [[antihypertensive]] [[vasodilator]] [[medication]] and is used to treat [[hair loss]]. It is available as a [[generic medication]] and [[Over the counter drug|over the counter]] for the treatment of [[androgenic alopecia]], a form of hair loss, in men and women.<ref name=UKlabel2015>{{cite web|title=Minoxidil Regular Strength|url=https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/22865|publisher=UK Electronic Medicines Compendium|accessdate=8 January 2017|date=18 August 2015}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
Minoxidil, applied topically, is widely used for the treatment of hair loss. It is effective in helping promote hair growth in both men and women with [[androgenic alopecia]].<ref name=Var2014/> About 40% of men experience hair regrowth after 3–6 months.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 25112173 | doi=10.1111/dth.12164 | volume=28 | issue=1 | title=Clinical utility and validity of minoxidil response testing in androgenetic alopecia. | journal=Dermatol Ther | pages=13–6}}</ref> Minoxidil must be used indefinitely for continued support of existing hair follicles and the maintenance of any experienced hair regrowth.<ref name=UKlabel2015/>

Its effect in people with [[alopecia areata]] is unclear.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hordinsky|first1=M|last2=Donati|first2=A|title=Alopecia areata: an evidence-based treatment update.|journal=American journal of clinical dermatology|date=July 2014|volume=15|issue=3|pages=231–46|pmid=25000998|doi=10.1007/s40257-014-0086-4}}</ref>

==Side effects==
Minoxidil is generally well tolerated, but common side effects include burning or irritation of the eye, itching, redness or irritation at the treated area, and unwanted hair growth elsewhere on the body. Exacerbation of hair loss/alopecia has been reported.<ref>http://www.drugs.com/sfx/rogaine-side-effects.html</ref><ref name="Drugs.com">{{cite web | url = http://www.drugs.com/pro/minoxidil.html | title = Minoxidil Official FDA information, side effects and uses | publisher = Drugs.com}}</ref> Severe allergic reactions may include rash, hives, itching, difficulty breathing, tightness in the chest, swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue, chest pain, dizziness, fainting, [[tachycardia]], headache, sudden and unexplained weight gain, or swelling of the hands and feet.<ref>[http://www.drugs.com/sfx/rogaine-side-effects.html Rogaine Side Effects | Drugs.com]</ref>
Temporary hair loss is a common side effect of minoxidil treatment.<ref>[http://www.rogaine.com/men/faq#question-9 FAQs | Rogaine]</ref> Manufacturers note that minoxidil-induced hair loss is a common side effect and describe the process as "shedding".

[[Alcohol]] and [[propylene glycol]] present in some topical preparations may dry the scalp, resulting in [[dandruff]] and [[contact dermatitis]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/407641 | title = Dandruff and Seborrheic Dermatitis | accessdate = 2009-10-09 | publisher = Medscape.com}}</ref>

Side effects of oral minoxidil may include swelling of the face and extremities, rapid and irregular heartbeat, lightheadedness, cardiac lesions, and focal [[necrosis]] of the [[papillary muscle]] and subendocardial areas of the left ventricle.<ref name="Drugs.com"/> Cases of allergic reactions to minoxidil or the non-active ingredient propylene glycol, which is found in some topical minoxidil formulations, have been reported. [[Pseudoacromegaly]] is an extremely rare side effect reported with large doses of oral minoxidil.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Nguyen | first1 = K. | last2 = Marks Jr | first2 = J. | title = Pseudoacromegaly induced by the long-term use of minoxidil | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology | volume = 48 | issue = 6 | pages = 962–965 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12789195 | doi = 10.1067/mjd.2003.325 }}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
The [[mechanism of action|mechanism]] by which minoxidil promotes hair growth is not fully understood. Minoxidil is a [[potassium channel opener]], causing [[Hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarization]] of cell membranes. Hypothetically, by widening blood vessels and opening potassium channels, it allows more oxygen, blood, and nutrients to the [[hair follicle|follicles]]. This may cause follicles in the [[telogen phase]] to shed, which are then replaced by thicker hairs in a new [[anagen phase]]. Minoxidil is a [[prodrug]] that is converted by [[sulfation]] via the [[sulfotransferase]] [[enzyme]] [[SULT1A1]] to its active form, [[minoxidil sulfate]]. Several studies demonstrated that the activity of sulfotransferase in hair follicles predict minoxidil response in the treatment of hair loss.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/dth.12164| title = Clinical utility and validity of minoxidil response testing in androgenetic alopecia| journal = Dermatologic Therapy| volume = 28| pages = 13–6| year = 2015| last1 = Goren | first1 = A. | last2 = Shapiro | first2 = J. | last3 = Roberts | first3 = J. | last4 = McCoy | first4 = J. | last5 = Desai | first5 = N. | last6 = Zarrab | first6 = Z. | last7 = Pietrzak | first7 = A. | last8 = Lotti | first8 = T. | pmid=25112173}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/dth.12130| title = Sulfotransferase activity in plucked hair follicles predicts response to topical minoxidil in the treatment of female androgenetic alopecia| journal = Dermatologic Therapy| volume = 27| issue = 4| pages = 252–254| year = 2014| last1 = Roberts | first1 = J. | last2 = Desai | first2 = N. | last3 = McCoy | first3 = J. | last4 = Goren | first4 = A. }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/dth.12111| title = Novel enzymatic assay predicts minoxidil response in the treatment of androgenetic alopecia| journal = Dermatologic Therapy| volume = 27| issue = 3| pages = 171–173| year = 2014| last1 = Goren | first1 = A. | last2 = Castano | first2 = J.

Minoxidil is less effective when the area of hair loss is large. In addition, its effectiveness has largely been demonstrated in younger men who have experienced hair loss for less than 5 years. Minoxidil use is indicated for central ([[Vertex (anatomy)|vertex]]) hair loss only.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Scow | first1= DT|last2= Nolte| first2= RS |last3= Shaughnessy| first3= AF |title=Medical treatments for balding in men |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=59 |issue=8 |pages=2189–94 |date=April 1999 |pmid=10221304 |doi= |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/1999/0415/p2189.html }}</ref> Minoxidil is also a [[vasodilator]].<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/high-blood-pressure-medication/HI00057 Vasodilators | MayoClinic.com]</ref> Two clinical studies are being conducted in the US for a medical device that may allow patients to determine if they are likely to benefit from minoxidil therapy.<ref>[http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02198261?term=minoxidil&rank=1 Minoxidil Response Testing in Males With Androgenetic Alopecia]</ref>

==History==

=== Initial application ===
Minoxidil was developed in the late 1950s by the [[Upjohn|Upjohn Company]] (later became part of [[Pfizer]]) to treat [[Peptic ulcer|ulcers]]. In trials using dogs, the compound did not cure ulcers, but proved to be a powerful vasodilator. Upjohn synthesized over 200 variations of the compound, including the one it developed in 1963 and named minoxidil.<ref name="kahn" /> These studies resulted in [[FDA]] approving minoxidil (with the trade name 'Loniten') in the form of oral [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]] to treat [[arterial hypertension|high blood pressure]] in 1979.<ref name="medical">{{cite book|last=Conrad|first=Peter|date=2008|title=The Medicalization of Society: On the Transformation of Human Conditions into Treatable Disorders|chapter=Extension|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cAE5hlP5YkAC&pg=PA37&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false|location=|publisher=JHU Press|page=37|isbn=0801892341|accessdate=2015-05-11}} (Google Books)</ref>

=== Hair growth ===
When Upjohn received permission from the FDA to test the new drug as medicine for hypertension they approached Charles A.

Puzzled by this side-effect, Chidsey consulted Guinter Kahn and discussed the possibility of using minoxidil  for treating [[hair loss]].

Kahn along with his colleague Paul J. Grant MD obtained a certain amount of the drug and conducted their own research, apparently without notifying Upjohn or Chidsey.<ref name="firstcl">{{cite web|url=https://firstclinical.com/journal/2006/0603_Patents.pdf |title=When Patents Became Interesting in Clinical Research |website= |author=Norman M.

A decade-long trial between Kahn and Upjohn ended with Kahn's name included in a consolidated patent (U.S. #4,596,812 Charles A Chidsey, III and Guinter Kahn) in 1986 and royalties from the company to both Kahn and Grant.<ref name="firstcl" />

Meanwhile the effect of minoxidil on hair loss prevention was so clear that in the 1980s physicians were prescribing Loniten [[Off-label use|off-label]] to their balding patients.<ref name="medical" />

In August, 1988, the FDA finally approved the drug for treating baldness in men<ref name="medical" /><ref name="gazette" /> under the trade name 'Rogaine' (FDA rejected Upjohn's first choice, Regain, as misleading<ref name="hair">{{cite book|last=Kuntzman|first=Gersh|date=2001|title=Hair!: Mankind's Historic Quest to End Baldness|chapter=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=omYBD2Ncn4YC&pg=PT172&lpg=PT172&dq=#v=onepage&q&f=false|location=|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|page=172|isbn=0679647090|accessdate=2015-05-11}} (Google Books)</ref>). The agency concluded that although "the product will not work for everyone", 39% of the men studied had "moderate to dense hair growth on the crown of the head".<ref name="hair" />

In 1991, Upjohn made the product available for women.<ref name="gazette" />

On February 12, 1996, the FDA approved both the [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] sale of the drug and the production of [[Generic drug|generic formulations]] of minoxidil.<ref name="medical" /> Upjohn replied to that by lowering prices to half the price of the prescription drug<ref name="gazette" /> and by releasing a prescription 5% formula of Rogaine in 1997.<ref name="medical" />

In 1998, a 5% formulation of minoxidil was approved for nonprescription sale by the FDA.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pray|first=Stephen W.|date=2006|title=Nonprescription Product Therapeutics|chapter=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XU1sMK1djVAC&pg=PA663&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false|location=|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|page=663|isbn=0781734983|accessdate=2015-05-11}} (Google Books)</ref>
