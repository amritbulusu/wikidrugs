'''4-Fluoromethylphenidate''' (also known as '''4-FMPH''' and '''4F-MPH''') is a [[stimulant]] drug that acts as a higher potency [[dopamine reuptake inhibitor]] than the closely related [[methylphenidate]].<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960894X04000630 | title=Synthesis of methylphenidate analogues and their binding affinities at dopamine and serotonin transport sites | author=Huw M.L.

4-Fluoromethylphenidate was studied further along with other analogues of (±)-threo-methylphenidate (TMP) to assess their potential as anti-[[cocaine]] medications. 4F-MPH was reported as having an [[Effective dose (pharmacology)|ED<sub>50</sub>]] mg/kg of 0.26 (0.18–0.36) and a relative potency of 3.33 to Methylphenidate.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/301/2/527 | title=Biochemical and Behavioral Characterization of Novel Methylphenidate Analogs | author=M.

Another study found that in the threo-isomers of methylphenidate, the [[Meta- (chemistry)|meta]]- and [[Arene substitution pattern|para]]-substituted compounds with electron-withdrawing substituents tended to have increased binding potency. Compounds containing [[fluorine]], [[chlorine]], [[bromine]] and [[Methyl group|methyl]] groups were reported to be more potent than methylphenidate. 4F-MPH was reported as having the following values: [<sup>3</sup>H][[WIN 35428]] binding of 35.0 ± 3.0 (2) and [<sup>3</sup>H]dopamine 142 ± 2.0 (2).<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm950697c | title=Synthesis and Pharmacology of Potential Cocaine Antagonists. 2.
