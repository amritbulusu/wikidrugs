'''Benzylpiperazine''' ('''BZP''') is a [[recreational drug]] with [[euphoriant]] and [[stimulant]] properties. The effects produced by BZP are comparable to those produced by [[amphetamine]]. Adverse effects have been reported following its use including [[psychosis|acute psychosis]], [[renal]] toxicity and [[seizures]].<ref name="Schep2011">{{cite journal |vauthors=Schep LJ, Slaughter RJ, Vale JA, Beasley DM, Gee P |title=The clinical toxicology of the designer "party pills" benzylpiperazine and trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine |journal=[[Clin Toxicol (Phila)]] |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=131–41 |date=March 2011 |pmid=21495881 |doi=10.3109/15563650.2011.572076 |url=}}</ref> No deaths have been reported following a sole ingestion of BZP, although there have been at least two deaths from the combination of BZP and [[MDMA]]. Its sale is banned in several countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom, Bulgaria, Romania and other parts of Europe.<ref>{{cite web|title =Legal dance drug faces ban amid fears over side-effects|author= Topping, Alexandra |work=The Guardian|date = 18 June 2007|url =https://www.theguardian.com/drugs/Story/0,,2105482,00.html|accessdate = 2008-05-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title =Harney announces ban on stimulant BZP|author= Examiner|publisher = The Irish Examiner|date = 18 June 2007|url =http://www.examiner.ie/breaking/ireland/eyaueyidqlql/|accessdate = 2009-12-28}}</ref>

== History ==

=== Development history ===
It is often claimed that BZP was originally synthesized as a potential [[antihelminthic]] (anti-parasitic) agent for use in farm animals.<ref>{{cite web|title = Lay off the party pills|publisher = New Zealand Medical Association| date = 1 November 2006|url =http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/GE0611/S00001.htm|accessdate = 2007-04-22}}</ref> However, there are some references to BZP in medical literature that predate interest in [[piperazine]]s as antihelminthics. Even so, the majority of the early work with the piperazines were investigations into their potential use as antihelminthics with the earliest [[clinical trial]]s in the literature relating to piperazine being articles in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=White R, Standen O |title=Piperazine in the Treatment of Threadworms in Children |journal=British Medical Journal |volume=2 |issue=4839 |pages=755–7 |year=1953 |pmc=2029560 |pmid=13082101 |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.4839.755}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Standen O |title=Activity of Piperazine, in vitro, Against Ascaris lumbricoides |journal=British Medical Journal |volume=2 |issue=4930 |pages=20–2 |year=1955 |pmc=1980175 |pmid=14378628 |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.4930.20-a}}</ref> It was discovered that BZP had [[Adverse drug reaction|side effects]] and was largely abandoned as a worm treatment. It next appears in the literature in the 1970s when it was investigated as a potential [[antidepressant]] medication, but rejected when research reported that BZP had amphetamine-like effects and was liable to abuse. The study suggested that BZP “should be placed under statutory control similar to those regulating the use of amphetamine.”<ref name=Campbell>{{cite journal |vauthors=Campbell H, Cline W, Evans M, Lloyd J, Peck A |title=Comparison of the effects of dexamphetamine and 1-benzylpiperazine in former addicts |journal=Eur J Clin Pharmacol |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=170–6 |year=1973 |pmid=4586849 |doi=10.1007/BF00558281}}</ref>

=== Recreational history ===
In the early 1990s, the United States [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] noted the drug was being used recreationally in California. It also reported that BZP was being used as an [[adulterant]] in illicit drugs. Not long after, there was an explosion in the drug's use worldwide – a situation which was soon followed by legislative control in many countries. Since 1999, benzylpiperazine use grew sharply in New Zealand due to an initial complete lack of regulation. The New Zealand government attempted to ban the product as of 18 December 2007, but the necessary second reading of the bill did not happen in time for the law to be passed.<ref name="Misuse-2005">{{cite web|title =Misuse of Drugs Amendment Act 2005|publisher =New Zealand Government|date =17 June 2005|url =http://www.stanz.org.nz/images/ASSENT81.PDF|format =[[PDF]]|accessdate =2007-04-22|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070716013803/http://www.stanz.org.nz/images/ASSENT81.PDF|archivedate =16 July 2007|df =dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="Bay of Plenty Times">{{cite web|author= Michele McPherson|title = Party Pill Ban Delayed|url = http://www.bayofplentytimes.co.nz/localnews/storydisplay.cfm?storyid=3758134|publisher = Bay of Plenty Times|date = 12 December 2007| accessdate = 2007-12-31}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> It was so widely used that an estimated 5 million pills were sold in New Zealand in 2007.<ref name="Gee-2007">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gee P, Fountain J |title=Party on?

Piperazine-based stimulants began to appear in Europe in 2000<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=de Boer D, Bosman I, Hidvégi E, Manzoni C, Benkö A, dos Reys L, Maes R |title=Piperazine-like compounds: a new group of designer drugs-of-abuse on the European market |journal=Forensic Sci Int |volume=121 |issue=1–2 |pages=47–56 |year=2001 |pmid=11516887 |doi=10.1016/S0379-0738(01)00452-2}}</ref> but remained virtually unavailable in the rest of the world until recently. In early 2006, pills containing the active ingredients BZP and [[TFMPP]] began to appear in the city of [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada, where they first gained popularity with late night party-goers as a purported safer alternative to many of the illicit street drugs commonly available there. In 2007 piperazine based party-pill formulations started to become widely available nationwide which has caused concern with local authorities such as [[Health Canada]] and subsequently BZP has gained much media attention in 2008. In the United States, it is still used as an adulterant in ecstasy mimic tablets.<ref name="DEA MCG">{{cite web|title = DEA Microgram December 2008: Ecstasy Mimic Tablets|url = http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/programs/forensicsci/microgram/mg1208/mg1208.html|date = 25 December 2008|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090114182026/http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/programs/forensicsci/microgram/mg1208/mg1208.html|archivedate = 14 January 2009|df = dmy-all}}</ref>

== Production and distribution ==
[[File:bzp brands.jpg|thumb|200px|A selection of products containing BZP.]]

BZP is a piperazine derivative which comes as either the hydrochloride salt or a [[Freebase (chemistry)|free base]]. The hydrochloride salt is a white solid while the base form is a slightly yellowish-green liquid. BZP base is corrosive and causes burns.<ref name="DEA-2006">{{cite web|title = Drugs and Chemicals of Concern: N-Benzylpiperazine|publisher = US DEA|date = June 2006|url = http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drugs_concern/bzp_tmp/bzp_tmp.htm|accessdate = 2007-04-22|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070407080056/http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drugs_concern/bzp_tmp/bzp_tmp.htm|archivedate = 7 April 2007|df = dmy-all}}</ref>

In countries where its purchase is legal, BZP products are often produced in small specialist laboratories. The raw materials can be purchased from various chemical supply agencies and formed into tablets or capsules using relatively cheap production techniques. The resulting product can be marketed at extremely high [[markup (business)|markup]], so end-user prices can be as high as 300 times the bulk cost of raw ingredients.{{citation needed|date=July 2009}}

BZP is often marketed ostensibly as a "dietary supplement" to avoid meeting stricter laws that apply to medicines and drugs, despite the fact that BZP has no dietary value. As of late 2005, the Misuse of Drugs Act ensured it can no longer be classified or marketed as a [[dietary supplement]] in New Zealand.<ref name="Misuse-2005" /> Some retailers claim that BZP is a "natural" product, describing it as a "pepper extract" or "herbal high," when in fact the drug is entirely [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]],<ref name="Gee-2007" /> and has not been found to occur naturally.<ref name=" Alansari-2006">{{cite journal |vauthors=Alansari M, Hamilton D |title=Nephrotoxicity of BZP-based herbal party pills: a New Zealand case report |journal=[[The New Zealand Medical Journal|N Z Med J]] |volume=119 |issue=1233 |pages=U1959 |year=2006 |pmid=16680176}}</ref>

== Pharmacodynamics ==
BZP has been shown to have a mixed mechanism of action, acting on the [[serotonin|serotonergic]] and [[dopamine]]rgic receptor systems in a similar fashion to [[MDMA]].<ref name=Baumann>{{cite journal |vauthors=Baumann M, Clark R, Budzynski A, Partilla J, Blough B, Rothman R |title=Effects of "Legal X" piperazine analogs on dopamine and serotonin release in rat brain |journal=Ann N Y Acad Sci |volume=1025 |pages=189–97 |year= 2004 |pmid=15542717 |doi=10.1196/annals.1316.024}}</ref> BZP has amphetamine-like actions on the [[monoamine transporter|serotonin reuptake transporter]], which increase serotonin concentrations in the [[extracellular fluid]]s surrounding the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] and thereby increasing activation of the surrounding serotonin receptors.<ref name=Tekes>{{cite journal |vauthors=Tekes K, Tóthfalusi L, Malomvölgyi B, Hermán F, Magyar K |title=Studies on the biochemical mode of action of EGYT-475, a new antidepressant |journal=Pol J Pharmacol Pharm |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=203–11 |pmid=2448760 |year=1987}}</ref> BZP has a lower potency effect on the [[monoamine transporter|noradrenaline reuptake transporter]] and the [[monoamine transporter|dopamine reuptake transporter]].<ref name=Baumann/> BZP has a high affinity action at the [[Adrenoceptor|alpha2-adrenoreceptor]], it is an antagonist at the receptor, like [[yohimbine]], which inhibits negative feedback, causing an increase in released [[noradrenaline]].<ref name=" BilZ0r">{{cite web |author=BilZ0r |title=Neuropharmacology of BZP |publisher=Erowid.org |date=November 2003 |url=http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/bzp/bzp_article1.shtml |accessdate=2007-04-22}}</ref>

BZP also acts as a non-selective [[serotonin receptor]] [[agonist]] on a wide variety of serotonin receptors;<ref name=Tekes/> binding to 5HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors may explain its mild hallucinogenic effects at high doses, while partial agonist or antagonist effects at the 5HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors may explain some of BZPs peripheral side effects, as this receptor is expressed very densely in the gut, and binding to 5HT<sub>3</sub> receptors may explain the common side effect of headaches, as this receptor is known to be involved in the development of [[migraine]] headaches.

== Effects ==
[[File:eye bzp.jpg|thumb|right|Typical pupil dilation]]

The effects of BZP are largely similar to [[amphetamine]]s,<ref name="Schep2011"/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fantegrossi W, Winger G, Woods J, Woolverton W, Coop A |title=Reinforcing and discriminative stimulus effects of 1-benzylpiperazine and trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine in rhesus monkeys |journal=Drug Alcohol Depend |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=161–8 |year=2005 |pmid=15664717 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2004.07.014}}</ref> with one study finding that former amphetamine addicts were unable to distinguish between [[dextroamphetamine]] and BZP administered intravenously.<ref name=Campbell /> Users report alertness, euphoria and a general feeling of well being. The perception of certain sensations such as taste, colour or music may be subjectively enhanced. The average duration is longer than that of dextroamphetamine, typically lasting 4–6 hours with reports as long as 8 hours depending on the dose.<ref name="Drug-Forum">{{cite web|title =BZP Experiences |publisher = drugs-forum.co.uk|date = 8 July 2007|url =http://www.drugs-forum.co.uk/forum/showthread.php?t=34969%7CDrug

=== Subjective effects ===
Upon ingestion of between 50&nbsp;mg and 200&nbsp;mg of BZP, the user may experience any or all of the following:

* Depression (particularly with frequent/heavy use)

=== Tolerance ===
Research into BZP's tolerance is sparse. [[Anecdotal evidence]] from online sources claim tolerance to the central action of BZP will develop quickly.<ref name=" BilZ0r" /> Due to tiredness associated with the body's recovery from stimulants, such as BZP, it is uncommon for users to be able to sustain a week-long intake.

=== Toxic effects ===
[[File:Bzptablet.jpg|right|thumb|An impure '[[MDMA|ecstasy]]' tablet – seized by law enforcement in the United States – containing BZP, [[methamphetamine]], and [[caffeine]]]]
As with most [[sympathomimetic]] [[stimulant]]s there appear to be significant side effects associated with BZP use. BZP reportedly produces insomnia and a mild to severe [[hangover]] after the drug effect wears off,<ref name="Nicholson-2006" /> however, some manufacturers in New Zealand have started including recovery pills which contain [[5-Hydroxytryptophan|5-HTP]] and vitamins which allegedly ease these hangovers.

The major side effects include dilated pupils, blurred vision, dryness of the mouth, extreme alertness, [[pruritus]], [[confusion]], [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]], tremor, extrapyramidal symptoms ([[dystonia]], [[akathisia]]), headache, [[dizziness]], anxiety, [[insomnia]], vomiting, [[chest pain]], [[hallucination]]s, [[paresthesia]], [[tachycardia]], [[hypertension]], [[palpitation]]s, collapse, [[hyperventilation]], sweating, [[hyperthermia]] and problems with [[urine retention]].<ref name="Schep2011"/><ref name="Nicholson-2006" /><ref name="Gee-2008">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gee P, Gilbert M, Richardson S, Moore G, Paterson S, Graham P |title=Toxicity from the recreational use of 1-benzylpiperazine |journal=Clin Toxicol (Phila) |volume=46 |issue=9 |pages=802–7 |date=November 2008 |pmid=18821145 |doi=10.1080/15563650802307602}}</ref><ref name="Gee-2005">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gee P, Richardson S, Woltersdorf W, Moore G |title=Toxic effects of BZP-based herbal party pills in humans: a prospective study in Christchurch, New Zealand |journal=[[The New Zealand Medical Journal|N Z Med J]] |volume=118 |issue=1227 |pages=U1784 |year=2005 |url=http://www.nzma.org.nz/journal/118-1227/1784/content.pdf |pmid=16372033 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007080620/http://www.nzma.org.nz/journal/118-1227/1784/content.pdf |archivedate=7 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name="Theron-2007">{{cite journal |vauthors=Theron L, Jansen K, Miles J |title=Benzylpiperizine-based party pills' impact on the Auckland City Hospital Emergency Department Overdose Database (2002–2004) compared with ecstasy (MDMA or methylene dioxymethamphetamine), gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB), amphetamines, cocaine and alcohol |journal=[[The New Zealand Medical Journal|N Z Med J]] |volume=120 |issue=1249 |pages=U2416 |year=2007 |url=http://www.nzma.org.nz/journal/120-1249/2416/content.pdf |pmid=17308553 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012221915/http://www.nzma.org.nz/journal/120-1249/2416/content.pdf |archivedate=12 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The more severe toxic effects include psychosis or adverse psychiatric events,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mohandas A, Vecchio D |title=A case report of Benzylpiperazine induced new onset affective symptoms in a patient with schizophrenia |journal=European Psychiatry |volume=23 |pages=S315–S316 |year=2008|doi=10.1016/j.eurpsy.2008.01.1085}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Austin H, Monasterio E |title=Acute psychosis following ingestion of 'Rapture' |journal=Australasian Psychiatry |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=406–8 |year=2004 |pmid=15715818 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1665.2004.02137.x}}</ref> renal toxicity,<ref name=" Alansari-2006" /> [[respiratory failure]],<ref name="Schep2011"/> [[hyperthermia]],<ref name="Schep2011"/> [[serotonin syndrome]],<ref name="Schep2011"/> [[rhabdomyolysis]]<ref name="pmid20184432">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gee P, Jerram T, Bowie D |title=Multiorgan failure from 1-benzylpiperazine ingestion—legal high or lethal high? |journal=[[Clin Toxicol (Phila)]] |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=230–3 |date=March 2010 |pmid=20184432 |doi=10.3109/15563651003592948}}</ref> and [[seizure]].<ref name="Nicholson-2006" /><ref name="Gee-2005" /> Blood benzylpiperazine concentrations have been measured either to confirm clinical intoxication or as part of a medicolegal death investigation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baselt, R. |title=Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man|edition=8|publisher=Biomedical Publications|place=Foster City, CA|year=2008|pages=155–156|isbn=0-931890-08-X}}</ref>

==== Christchurch study ====
The majority of the toxic effects information came from a study conducted between 1 April 2005 to 1 September 2005. The study recorded all presentations associated with party pill use at the [[Emergency Department]] of [[Christchurch]] Hospital, New Zealand by recording them on a prospective data collection form. The aim was to study the patterns of human toxicity related to the use of benzylpiperazine-based 'party pills'. 61 patients presented on 80 occasions. Patients with mild to moderate toxicity experienced symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, dystonia and urinary retention. Significantly, fourteen toxic [[seizures]] were recorded with two patients suffering life-threatening [[toxicity]] with [[status epilepticus]] and severe respiratory and [[metabolic acidosis]]. It was concluded that BZP appears to induce toxic seizures in neurologically normal subjects.<ref name="Gee-2005" /> The results of this study and others like it<ref name="Nicholson-2006" /><ref name="Theron-2007" /> showed that BZP can cause unpredictable and serious toxicity in some individuals, but the data and dosage collection were reliant on self reporting by drug users, which may result in under-reporting (or over-reporting), and there were complicating factors like the frequent presence of alcohol and other drugs.<ref name="Theron-2007" />

=== Risk of fatality ===
A retrospective study carried out at an [[Auckland]] emergency department found that BZP presentations only made a minor contribution to their overdose database with most cases not producing any significant toxicity.<ref name="Theron-2007" /> Several cases where BZP individually or combined with alcohol or other medicines or illicit drugs resulting in complications exist. One such example is the well publicised case of a combination of BZP and [[MDMA]] by a 23-year-old from [[Greymouth|Greymouth, New Zealand]]. Ben Rodham, a DJ, ingested a combination of BZP and MDMA in February 2007, which nearly resulted in his death{{dubious|reason=not scholarly clinical evidence|date=April 2017}}. Rodham was put into an [[induced coma]] in an effort to prevent him from dying. He later recovered.<ref>{{cite web|title =Party On?|publisher = TV3 New Zealand|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204030030/http://www.tv3.co.nz/Programmes/NewsandCurrentAffairs/60Minutes/tabid/88/articleID/24491/Default.aspx|archivedate=4 December 2007|date = 9 April 2007|url =http://www.tv3.co.nz/Programmes/NewsandCurrentAffairs/60Minutes/tabid/88/ArticleID/24491/Default.aspx|accessdate = 2007-04-14}}</ref>

One in every 45 (2.2%) last-year users of BZP in New Zealand is classed as dependent upon it, although 97.9% of users said that "it would not be difficult to stop using legal party pills", and 45.2% of people who reported using both BZP and illegal drugs such as [[methamphetamine]] reported that they used BZP so that they did not have to use methamphetamine, which was perceived as more harmful.<ref name="Wilkins">{{cite web|vauthors=Wilkins C, Girling M, Sweetsur P, Huckle T, Huakau J |title=Legal party pill use in New Zealand: Prevalence of use, availability, health harms and ‘gateway effects’ of benzylpiperazine (BZP) and trifluorophenylmethylpiperazine (TFMPP) |publisher=Centre for Social and Health Outcomes Research and Evaluation (SHORE) |url=http://www.spiritualhigh.co.uk/spiritualhigh.co.uk/downloads/Legal-party-pills-in-New-Zealand-report.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=2007-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318042503/http://www.spiritualhigh.co.uk/spiritualhigh.co.uk/downloads/Legal-party-pills-in-New-Zealand-report.pdf |archivedate=18 March 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref>
Still, most of the people who use BZP, even though they say it is quite easy to stop, do not want to, and continue to use the drug, feeling that it helps them to reach higher levels of mood, sociability, and energy.<ref name="Wilkins" />
Studies undertaken on animals have indicated that BZP can substitute for methamphetamine in addicted rats, although it is one-tenth as potent and produces correspondingly weaker addictive effects.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Brennan K, Johnstone A, Fitzmaurice P, Lea R, Schenk S |title=Chronic benzylpiperazine (BZP) exposure produces behavioral sensitization and cross-sensitization to methamphetamine (MA) |journal=Drug Alcohol Depend |volume=88 |issue=2–3 |pages=204–13 |year=2007 |pmid=17125936 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2006.10.016}}</ref>

In Canada, Benzylpiperazine and salts of benzylpiperazine are classified as Schedule III controlled substances under the [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (S.C. 1996, c. 19) |publisher=Canadian Department of Justice |date=7 July 2014 |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-38.8/page-26.html#h-30 |accessdate=2014-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215170432/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-38.8/page-26.html |archivedate=15 December 2013 |df= }}</ref>

[[Piperazine]] and salts of [[piperazine]] are classified as [[Prescription Only Medicines]] in the UK. Any products containing salts of [[piperazine]] would be licensable under the [[Medicines Act]]<ref>Sect. 8 of Medicines Act 1968 – Schedule 3, SI 3144 The Medicines for Human Use (Marketing Authorisations Etc) Regulations 1994</ref> and consequently anyone manufacturing and supplying it legally must hold the relevant licenses to do so. BZP is not a salt of [[piperazine]], but mislabelling of BZP products as containing "piperazine blend" resulted in some prosecutions of suppliers in the UK by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, although none were successful.<ref>{{cite web|title = Thousands of 'pep' pills seized in Middlesbrough|publisher = Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency|date = 17 August 2006|url = http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&useSecondary=true&ssDocName=CON2024549&ssTargetNodeId=389|accessdate = 2007-04-14|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928010717/http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&useSecondary=true&ssDocName=CON2024549&ssTargetNodeId=389|archivedate = 28 September 2007|df = dmy-all}}</ref> In May 2009, the [[Home Office]] announced plans to ban BZP,<ref>{{cite web|title =Move to outlaw two 'party' drugs|publisher=BBC News|date = 21 May 2009|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8061693.stm}}</ref> and launched a consultation on the proposal.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Homeoffice.gov.uk|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/documents/cons-2009-bzp/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805061711/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/documents/cons-2009-bzp/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 August 2012|date=30 October 2009|accessdate=2010-01-01|title=Summary of response: consultation on proposed control under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 of (1) 1-Benzylpiperazine and a group of substituted piperazines}}</ref> In October 2009, it was announced that from 23 December 2009, BZP and related piperazines would be [[List of controlled drugs in the United Kingdom#Class C drugs|Class C drugs]] under the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971|Misuse Of Drugs Act]].<ref>{{cite web|title =Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Amendment) Order 2009|url =http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2009/draft/ukdsi_9780111486610_en_1}}</ref>

BZP is not controlled under any UN convention, so the compounds themselves are legal throughout most of the world, although in most countries their use is restricted to pharmaceutical manufacturing and recreational use is unknown.<ref>{{cite web|title =Benzylpiperazine Legal Status|publisher = Erowid.org|date = 17 November 2002|url =http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/bzp/bzp_law.shtml |accessdate = 2007-04-22}}</ref>

Benzylpiperazine is, however, to be the subject of a [[European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction]] (EMCDDA) risk assessment, the results of which may determine what, if any, control will placed on BZP throughout [[European Union|the European Union]]. The [[risk assessment]] comes about as the result of a joint Europol – EMCDDA report which concluded that BZP needs to be looked at in more detail. The results were published in June 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title =New drug under formal scrutiny: Council asks EMCDDA to assess risks of BZP|publisher = European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction|date = 23 March 2007|url =http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/index.cfm?fuseaction=public.AttachmentDownload&nNodeID=27522&slanguageISO=EN| format = PDF|accessdate = 2007-04-14}}</ref> The report concluded that the use of BZP can lead to medical problems even if the long effects are still unknown.

Based on the recommendation of the EACD, the New Zealand government has passed legislation which placed BZP, along with the other piperazine derivatives TFMPP, mCPP, pFPP, MeOPP and MBZP, into Class C of the New Zealand Misuse of Drugs Act 1975. A ban was intended to come into effect in New Zealand on 18 December 2007, but the law change did not go through until the following year, and the sale of BZP and the other listed piperazines became illegal in New Zealand as of 1 April 2008. An amnesty for possession and usage of these drugs was in effect until October 2008, at which point they became completely illegal.<ref>{{cite web|title =Misuse of Drugs (Classification of BZP) Amendment Bill |publisher = New Zealand Parliament|date = 20 August 2007|url =http://www.parliament.nz/NR/rdonlyres/B369ADAE-770D-4B5D-B51A-9CE612B12984/83028/DBHOH_BILL_8220_531999994.pdf|accessdate = 2008-05-26}}</ref>
