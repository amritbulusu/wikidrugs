'''Citicoline''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]), also known as '''cytidine diphosphate-choline''' ('''CDP-Choline''') or '''cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine''' is an intermediate in the generation of [[phosphatidylcholine]] from [[choline]], a common biochemical process in [[cell membrane]]s. Citicoline is naturally occurring in the [[cells]] of human and animal tissue, in particular the organs.

Citicoline has also been shown to elevate [[ACTH]] independently from [[Corticotropin-releasing hormone|CRH]] levels and to amplify the release of other [[HPA axis]] hormones such as [[luteinizing hormone|LH]], [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]], [[growth hormone|GH]] and [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]] in response to hypothalamic releasing factors.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cavun S, Savci V | title = CDP-choline increases plasma ACTH and potentiates the stimulated release of GH, TSH and LH: the cholinergic involvement | journal = Fundamental & Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 513–23 | date = Oct 2004 | pmid = 15482372 | doi = 10.1111/j.1472-8206.2004.00272.x }}</ref>

===Memory disorders===
In a review of 14 clinical trials, the authors concluded there was evidence of benefit of citicoline on memory function and behaviour in patients suffering from cognitive deficits ranging from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Dosing in most of the trials was 1000 mg/day.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fioravanti M, Yanagi M |title=Cytidinediphosphocholine (CDP-choline) for cognitive and behavioural disturbances associated with chronic cerebral disorders in the elderly |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD000269 |year=2005 |pmid=15846601 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000269.pub3 |url=}}</ref> A more recent review reached the same conclusions, but went on to state that more clinical trials are needed to confirm its benefits.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gareri P, Castagna A, Cotroneo AM, Putignano S, De Sarro G, Bruni AC |title=The role of citicoline in cognitive impairment: pharmacological characteristics, possible advantages, and doubts for an old drug with new perspectives |journal=Clin Interv Aging |volume=10 |issue= |pages=1421–9 |year=2015 |pmid=26366063 |pmc=4562749 |doi=10.2147/CIA.S87886 |url=}}</ref>

===Ischemic stroke===
Citicoline is approved for treatment in cases of [[head trauma]], [[stroke]], and [[neurodegenerative disease]] in [[Japan]] and [[Europe]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Citicoline improves the clinical outcome following an [[ischemic stroke]], as evidenced by the reduction in size of lesions caused by ischemic strokes after supplementation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Warach S, Pettigrew LC, Dashe JF, Pullicino P, Lefkowitz DM, Sabounjian L, Harnett K, Schwiderski U, Gammans R | title = Effect of citicoline on ischemic lesions as measured by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging.

== Mechanism of action ==

[[File:Synthesis of choline from citicoline.png|thumb|Enzymes involved in reactions are identified by numbers. See file description.]]

=== Neuroprotective effects ===

The neuroprotective effects exhibited by citicoline may be due to its preservation of [[cardiolipin]] and [[sphingomyelin]], preservation of [[arachidonic acid]] content of [[phosphatidylcholine]] and [[phosphatidylethanolamine]], partial restoration of [[phosphatidylcholine]] levels, and stimulation of [[glutathione]] synthesis and [[glutathione reductase]] activity. Citicoline’s effects may also be explained by the reduction of [[phospholipase A2]] activity.<ref name="Adibhatla 2002">{{cite journal | vauthors = Adibhatla RM, Hatcher JF, Dempsey RJ | title = Citicoline: neuroprotective mechanisms in cerebral ischemia | journal = Journal of Neurochemistry | volume = 80 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–23 | date = Jan 2002 | pmid = 11796739 | doi = 10.1046/j.0022-3042.2001.00697.x }}</ref>

* By converting 1, 2-diacylglycerol into [[phosphatidylcholine]]
* Stimulating the synthesis of [[SAMe]], which aids in membrane stabilization and reduces levels of [[arachidonic acid]]. This is especially important after an [[ischemia]], when [[arachidonic acid]] levels are elevated.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rao AM, Hatcher JF, Dempsey RJ | title = CDP-choline: neuroprotection in transient forebrain ischemia of gerbils | journal = Journal of Neuroscience Research | volume = 58 | issue = 5 | pages = 697–705 | date = Dec 1999 | pmid = 10561698 | doi = 10.1002/(sici)1097-4547(19991201)58:5<697::aid-jnr11>3.0.co;2-b }}</ref>

=== Neuronal membrane ===

The brain prefers to use [[choline]] to synthesize [[acetylcholine]]. This limits the amount of [[choline]] available to synthesize [[phosphatidylcholine]]. When the availability of [[choline]] is low or the need for [[acetylcholine]] increases, phospholipids containing [[choline]] can be catabolized from neuronal membranes. These phospholipids include sphingomyelin and [[phosphatidylcholine]].<ref name="Adibhatla 2002" /> Supplementation with citicoline can increase the amount of [[choline]] available for [[acetylcholine]] synthesis and aid in rebuilding membrane [[phospholipid]] stores after depletion.<ref name="D’Orlando 1995">{{cite journal | vauthors = D'Orlando KJ, Sandage BW | title = Citicoline (CDP-choline): mechanisms of action and effects in ischemic brain injury | journal = Neurological Research | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 281–4 | date = Aug 1995 | pmid = 7477743 }}</ref> 
Citicoline decreases [[phospholipase]] stimulation. This can lower levels of [[hydroxyl radicals]] produced after an [[ischemia]] and prevent [[cardiolipin]] from being catabolized by [[phospholipase A2]].<ref name="Rao 2001">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rao AM, Hatcher JF, Dempsey RJ | title = Does CDP-choline modulate phospholipase activities after transient forebrain ischemia? | journal = Brain Research | volume = 893 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 268–72 | date = Mar 2001 | pmid = 11223016 | doi = 10.1016/S0006-8993(00)03280-7 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Adibhatla RM, Hatcher JF | title = Citicoline decreases phospholipase A2 stimulation and hydroxyl radical generation in transient cerebral ischemia | journal = Journal of Neuroscience Research | volume = 73 | issue = 3 | pages = 308–15 | date = Aug 2003 | pmid = 12868064 | doi = 10.1002/jnr.10672 }}</ref> It can also work to restore [[cardiolipin]] levels in the [[inner mitochondrial membrane]].<ref name="Rao 2001" />

=== Cell signalling ===

Citicoline enhances cellular communication by increasing the availability of neurotransmitters, including [[acetylcholine]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[dopamine]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Secades JJ, Lorenzo JL | title = Citicoline: pharmacological and clinical review, 2006 update | journal = Methods and Findings in Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 28 Suppl B | pages = 1–56 | date = Sep 2006 | pmid = 17171187 }}</ref>

=== Glutamate transport ===

Citicoline lowers increased [[glutamate]] concentrations and raises decreased [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] concentrations induced by [[ischemia]]. Citicoline also increases [[glutamate]] uptake by increasing expression of [[EAAT2]], a [[glutamate transporter]], in vitro in rat astrocytes. It is suggested that the neuroprotective effects of citicoline after a [[stroke]] are due in part to citicoline’s ability to decrease levels of [[glutamate]] in the brain.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hurtado O, Moro MA, Cárdenas A, Sánchez V, Fernández-Tomé P, Leza JC, Lorenzo P, Secades JJ, Lozano R, Dávalos A, Castillo J, Lizasoain I | title = Neuroprotection afforded by prior citicoline administration in experimental brain ischemia: effects on glutamate transport | journal = Neurobiology of Disease | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 336–345 | date = Mar 2005 | pmid = 15686962 | doi = 10.1016/j.nbd.2004.10.006 }}</ref>

== Pharmacokinetics ==

Citicoline is water-soluble, with more than 90% oral bioavailability.<ref name="D’Orlando 1995" /> Plasma levels peak one hour after oral ingestion, and a majority of the citicoline is excreted as [[CO2]] in respiration, and again 24 hours after ingestion, where the remaining citicoline is excreted through [[urine]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dinsdale JR, Griffiths GK, Rowlands C, Castelló J, Ortiz JA, Maddock J, Aylward M | title = Pharmacokinetics of 14C CDP-choline | journal = Arzneimittel-Forschung | volume = 33 | issue = 7A | pages = 1066–70 | year = 1983 | pmid = 6412727 }}</ref>

=== Side effects ===

Citicoline has a very low toxicity profile in animals and humans. Clinically, doses of 2000&nbsp;mg per day have been observed and approved. Minor transient adverse effects are rare and most commonly include stomach pain and diarrhea.<ref name="Conant 2004" />

== Synthesis ==

=== In vivo ===

[[Phosphatidylcholine]] is a major phospholipid in eukaryotic cell membranes. Close regulation of its biosynthesis, degradation, and distribution is essential to proper cell function. [[Phosphatidylcholine]] is synthesized [[in vivo]] by two pathways
* The [[Kennedy pathway]], which includes the transformation of [[choline]] to citicoline, by way of [[phosphorylcholine]], to produce [[phosphatidylcholine]] when condensed with [[diacylglycerol]].
* [[Phosphatidylcholine]] can also be produced by the methylation pathway, where [[phosphatidylethanolamine]] is sequentially [[methylated]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fernández-Murray JP, McMaster CR | title = Glycerophosphocholine catabolism as a new route for choline formation for phosphatidylcholine synthesis by the Kennedy pathway | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 280 | issue = 46 | pages = 38290–6 | date = Nov 2005 | pmid = 16172116 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M507700200 }}</ref>
