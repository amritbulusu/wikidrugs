'''Lorcaserin''', currently marketed under the trade name '''Belviq'''<ref name="reuters"/><ref name="trademarkia2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.trademarkia.com/belviq-85354490.html|title=Belviq|publisher=Trademarkia|date=23 Jun 2011|accessdate=27 June 2012}}</ref> and previously '''Lorqess''' during development,<ref name="evaluatepharma" /><ref name="trademarkia" /> is a [[weight-loss drug]] developed by [[Arena Pharmaceuticals]]. It reduces appetite by activating a type of [[serotonin receptor]] known as the [[5-HT2C receptor|5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor]] in a region of the brain called the [[hypothalamus]], which is known to control appetite.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shukla|first1=AP|last2=Kumar|first2=RB|last3=Aronne|first3=LJ|title=Lorcaserin Hcl for the treatment of obesity.|journal=Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy|date=2015|volume=16|issue=16|pages=2531–8|doi=10.1517/14656566.2015.1096345|pmid=26472579}}</ref>

== Medical uses ==

Lorcaserin is used long term for weight loss in those who are obese.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bray|first1=GA|last2=Frühbeck|first2=G|last3=Ryan|first3=DH|last4=Wilding|first4=JP|title=Management of obesity|journal=Lancet|date=7 May 2016|volume=387|issue=10031|pages=1947–56|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00271-3|pmid=26868660}}</ref>

== Side effects ==

In clinical trials, the most common side effect was [[headache]], experienced by about 18% of drug arm participants compared to 11% of placebo participants. Headache was the only reported side effect to occur at a frequency greater than 5 percentage points above those from placebo. Other reported side effects and their rates for lorcaserin and placebo patients, respectively, were as follows: [[upper respiratory tract infection]] (14.8% vs. 11.9%), [[nasopharyngitis]] (13.4% vs. 12.0%), [[sinusitis]] (7.2% vs. 8.2%), and [[nausea]] (7.5% vs. 5.4%). Adverse events of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], and [[suicidal ideation]] were infrequent and were reported at a similar rate in each treatment group.

On 15 September 2010 it was reported by national news media that lorcaserin was associated with the development of cancer in laboratory rats.<ref name="sfgate">{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/09/15/BU521FDLBC.DTL|title=FDA staff says Arena diet pill linked to cancer|publisher=SFGate|date=15 September 2010 | first=Catherine | last=Larkin}}</ref>

In December 2012, the US [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] proposed classifying lorcaserin as a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule IV controlled substances|Schedule IV]] drug because it has hallucinogenic properties at higher than approved doses and users could develop psychiatric dependencies on the drug.<ref name="Wilson">{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Megan R.|title=Reg Watch|url=http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/273901-reg-watch|newspaper=The Hill|date=December 19, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Schedules of Controlled Substances: Placement of Lorcaserin into Schedule IV|url=https://federalregister.gov/a/2012-30531}}</ref> On 7 May 2013, the US [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] classified lorcaserin as a Schedule IV drug<ref name="ofr"/> under the [[Controlled Substances Act]].<ref name="Wilson"/>

There has been concern that lorcaserin can cause [[cardiac valvulopathy]] based upon the reports of subjects taking the drug in Phase 2 trials. However, a Phase 3 clinical trial of the drug was conducted and the results published in the October 2014 Postgraduate Medicine journal, a peer-reviewed medical journal for physicians. These results found no statistically significant differences in valvulopathy rates compared to control, being 2.4% for the drug subjects and 2.0% for controls.<ref>http://www.belviqhcp.com/resources/</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==

Lorcaserin is a selective [[5-HT2C receptor|5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor]] [[agonist]],<ref name="pmid|18252809">{{Cite journal | last1 = Thomsen | first1 = W. J. | last2 = Grottick | first2 = A.

== Approval history ==

On 22 December 2009 a [[New Drug Application]] (NDA) was submitted to the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in the [[United States]].<ref name="urllorcaserin New Drug Application" /> On 16 September 2010, an FDA advisory panel voted to recommend against approval of the drug based on concerns over both safety and efficacy.<ref name="nytimes">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/health/17drug.html?hpw|title=F.D.A. Panel Urges Denial of Diet Drug|publisher=New York Times|author=Andrew Pollack|date=16 September 2010}}</ref> In October 2010, the FDA stated that it could not approve the application for lorcaserin in its present form.<ref name="prnewswire">{{cite news|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fda-issues-complete-response-letter-for-lorcaserin-new-drug-application-105586113.html |title=FDA Issues Complete Response Letter for Lorcaserin New Drug Application| date=23 October 2010}}</ref>

Lorcaserin had a [[Prescription Drug User Fee Act]] (PDUFA) date of 22 October 2010.<ref>[http://invest.arenapharm.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=475317 Arena Pharmaceuticals Announces Notification of Tentative September 16th FDA Advisory Committee Meeting to Review Lorcaserin for Weight Management], 2 June 2010</ref> On 16 September 2010, a federal advisory committee voted against recommending approval for lorcaserin. In their 9-5 vote, the committee raised concerns about the safety of the drug, particularly the findings of tumors in rats.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/16/f-d-a-panel-rejects-diet-pill-2/?pagemode=print | work=The New York Times | title=F.D.A. Panel Rejects Diet Pill | first=Andrew | last=Pollack | date=16 September 2010}}</ref>  On 23 October 2010, the FDA decided not to approve the drug based on the available data. This was not only because cancer promoting properties could not be ruled out, but also because the weight loss efficacy was considered "marginal."<ref name="prnewswire" />

After additional studies were completed and additional information submitted to the FDA, an advisory panel was convened on 10 May 2012. The advisory panel voted 19-4-1 to recommend lorcaserin to the FDA. The FDA stated that the weight loss data passed FDA standards for efficacy and that the drug did not have cancer risks based on clarifications in the data. The FDA panelist recommended that postmarketing studies regarding potential heart valve issues be completed.  The FDA has not stated one way or the other whether they believe this is necessary at this time although no related safety markers have been indicated during clinical studies.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} On 27 June 2012, the FDA officially approved lorcaserin for use in the treatment of obesity for some adults.<ref name="latimes"/><ref>http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm312468.htm</ref>

On 10 May 2012, after a new round of studies submitted by Arena, an FDA panel voted to recommend lorcaserin with certain restrictions and patient monitoring. The restrictions include patients with a [[body mass index|BMI]] of over 30, or with a BMI over 27 and a comorbidity such as high blood pressure or type 2 diabetes.<ref name="webmdlorca">{{cite web|title=New Diet Drug Lorcaserin Wins Vote From FDA Panel|url=http://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20120510/new-diet-drug-lorcaserin-wins-vote-from-fda-panel|publisher=webmd|date=10 May 2012}}</ref> On 27 June 2012, the FDA officially approved lorcaserin for use in the treatment of obesity for adults with a [[body mass index|BMI]] equal to or greater than 30 or adults with a BMI of 27 or greater who "have at least one weight-related health condition, such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or high cholesterol."<ref name="reuters">{{cite web|title=FDA approves Arena obesity drug; first in 13 years|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-arena-obesity-idUSBRE85Q1AA20120627|publisher=Reuters|date=27 June 2012}}</ref><ref name="latimes">{{cite web | url = http://www.latimes.com/health/boostershots/la-heb-obesity-drug-approved-fda-20120627,0,7045690.story | title = FDA approves lorcaserin, first weight-loss drug OK'd since 1999 | publisher = ''Los Angeles Times'' | date = June 27, 2012}}</ref>
