'''Troglitazone''' ('''Rezulin''', '''Resulin''', '''Romozin''', '''Noscal''') is an [[antidiabetic]] and [[anti-inflammatory]] drug, and a member of the [[medication|drug]] class of the [[thiazolidinedione]]s. It was prescribed for patients with [[diabetes mellitus type 2]].<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=Lawrence|title=Adverse Diabetes Drug News Sends Warner-Lambert Down|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/04/business/adverse-diabetes-drug-news-sends-warner-lambert-down.html|accessdate=12 December 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=4 November 1997}}</ref>  It was developed by [[Daiichi Sankyo]] (Japan). In the United States, it was introduced and manufactured by [[Parke-Davis]] in the late 1990s, but turned out to be associated with an [[idiosyncratic drug reaction|idiosyncratic reaction]] leading to drug-induced [[hepatitis]]. The F.D.A. medical officer assigned to evaluate troglitazone, John Gueriguian, did not recommend its approval due to potential high liver toxicity; Parke-Davis complained to the FDA and Gueriguian was subsequently removed from his post.<ref>[https://www.wired.com/medtech/drugs/multimedia/2008/10/gallery_retired_drugs?slide=6&slideView=6 Retired Drugs: Failed Blockbusters, Homicidal Tampering, Fatal Oversights], wired.com</ref> A full panel of experts approved it in January 1997.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s00125-006-0245-0 | title = Risks of troglitazone apparent before approval in USA | year = 2006 | last1 = Cohen | first1 = J. S. | journal = Diabetologia | volume = 49 | pages = 1454–5 | pmid = 16601971 | issue = 6}}</ref>  Once the prevalence of adverse liver effects became known, troglitazone was withdrawn from the [[United Kingdom|British]] market in December 1997, from the [[United States]] market in 2000, and from the [[Japan]]ese market soon afterwards. It did not get approval in the rest of Europe.

==Mechanism of action==
Troglitazone, like the other [[thiazolidinedione]]s ([[pioglitazone]] and [[rosiglitazone]]), works by activating [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor]]s (PPARs).

Troglitazone is a ligand to both PPARα and – more strongly – PPARγ. Troglitazone also contains an α-tocopheroyl moiety, potentially giving it [[vitamin E]]-like activity in addition to its PPAR activation. It has been shown to reduce [[inflammation]]:<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Aljada A, Garg R, Ghanim H, etal |title=Nuclear factor-kappaB suppressive and inhibitor-kappaB stimulatory effects of troglitazone in obese patients with type 2 diabetes: evidence of an antiinflammatory action? |journal=J.

Metab. |volume=86 |issue=7 |pages=3250–6 |year=2001 |pmid=11443197 |doi=10.1210/jc.86.7.3250 }}</ref> troglitazone use was associated with a decrease of [[NF-κB|nuclear factor kappa-B]] (NF-κB) and a concomitant increase in its inhibitor (IκB). NFκB is an important cellular transcription regulator for the immune response.

==History==
Troglitazone was developed as the first anti-diabetic drug having a mechanism of action involving the enhancement of insulin sensitivity.  At the time it was widely believed that such drugs, by addressing the primary metabolic defect associated with Type 2 diabetes, would have numerous benefits including avoiding the risk of hypoglycemia associated with insulin and earlier oral antidiabetic drugs.  It was further believed that reducing insulin resistance would potentially reduce the very high rate of cardiovascular disease that is associated with diabetes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Henry RR |title=Effects of troglitazone on insulin sensitivity |journal=Diabet.

[[Warner–Lambert|Parke-Davis/Warner Lambert]] submitted the diabetes drug Rezulin for [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (F.D.A.) review on July 31, 1996. The medical officer assigned to the review, Dr. John L. Gueriguian, cited Rezulin's potential to harm the liver and the heart and he questioned its viability in lowering blood sugar for patients with adult-onset diabetes, recommending against the drug's approval. After complaints from the drugmaker, Gueriguian was removed on November 4, 1996 and his review was purged by the F.D.A.<ref name=LATimes /><ref name=Willman>{{cite news|last=Willman|first=David|title=The Rise and Fall of the Killer Drug Rezulin|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jun/04/news/mn-37375|accessdate=12 December 2012|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=4 June 2000}}</ref> Gueriguian and the company had a single meeting, at which Gueriguian used "intemperate" language; the company said its objections were based on inappropriate remarks made by Gueriguian.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1998/Report-FDA-Removes-Medical-Officer/id-76dfa040579fe2d4f72b9b8f9df981d6 |title=Report: FDA Removes Medical Officer |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> Parke-Davis said at the advisory committee that the risk of liver toxicity was comparable to placebo and that additional data of other studies confirmed this.<ref name=Avorn>{{cite book|last=Avorn|first=J|title=Powerful medicines|year=2005|publisher=Vintage books|location=New York}}</ref>  According to Peter Gøtzsche, when the company provided these additional data one week after approval, they showed a substantially greater risk for liver toxicity.<ref name=gotzsche>{{cite book|last=Gøtzsche|first=Peter|title=Deadly medicines and organised crime : how big pharma has corrupted healthcare|year=2013|publisher=Radcliffe Publ.|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=9781846198847|page=185}}</ref>

The F.D.A. approved the drug on January 29, 1997, and it appeared in pharmacies in late March.

In 2009 Pfizer Inc. resolved all but three of 35,000 claims over its withdrawn diabetes drug Rezulin for a total of about $750 million. Pfizer, which acquired rival Wyeth for almost $64 billion, paid about $500 million to settle Rezulin cases consolidated in federal court in New York, according to court filings.
