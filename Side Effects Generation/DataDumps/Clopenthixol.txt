'''Clopenthixol''' ('''Sordinol'''), also known as '''clopentixol''', is a [[typical antipsychotic]] [[drug]] of the [[thioxanthene]] class. It was introduced by [[Lundbeck]] in 1961.<ref name="isbn0-471-89980-1">{{cite book | author = Sneader, Walter | title = Drug discovery: a history | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | year = 2005 | page = 410 | isbn = 0-471-89980-1 | oclc = | doi = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Cb6BOkj9fK4C&lpg=PA410&pg=PA410#v=onepage}}</ref>

Clopenthixol is a mixture of ''[[cis–trans isomerism|cis]]'' and ''[[cis–trans isomerism|trans]]'' [[isomer]]s. [[Zuclopenthixol]], the pure ''cis'' isomer, was later introduced by Lundbeck in 1962,<ref name="isbn3-527-31058-4">{{cite book | author = José Miguel Vela | author2 = Helmut Buschmann | author3 = Jörg Holenz | author4 = Antonio Párraga | author5 = Antoni Torrens | title = Antidepressants, Antipsychotics, Anxiolytics: From Chemistry and Pharmacology to Clinical Application | publisher = Wiley-VCH | location = Weinheim | year = 2007 | page = 516 | isbn = 3-527-31058-4 | oclc = | doi = | accessdate = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yXD4QA-Y_Z0C&lpg=PA520&dq=thioxanthene%201965%20pfizer&pg=PA516#v=onepage&q=}}</ref> and has been much more widely used. Both drugs are equally effective as antipsychotics and have similar [[adverse drug reaction|adverse effect]] profiles, but clopenthixol is half as active on a milligram-to-milligram basis and appears to produce more [[sedation]] in comparison.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gravem A, Engstrand E, Guleng RJ |title=Cis(''Z'')-clopenthixol and clopenthixol (Sordinol) in chronic psychotic patients.
