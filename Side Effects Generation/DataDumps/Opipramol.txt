'''Opipramol''', sold under the brand name '''Insidon''' among others, is an [[anxiolytic]] and [[antidepressant]] which is used throughout [[Europe]].<ref name="Elks2014" /><ref name="IndexNominum2000" /><ref name="Drugs.com" /><ref name="pmid11199949">{{cite journal |vauthors=Möller HJ, Volz HP, Reimann IW, Stoll KD | title = Opipramol for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder: a placebo-controlled trial including an alprazolam-treated group | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 59–65 |date=February 2001 | pmid = 11199949 | doi = 10.1097/00004714-200102000-00011 | url = http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0271-0749&volume=21&issue=1&spage=59}}</ref><ref name="pmid15547785">{{cite journal |vauthors=Müller WE, Siebert B, Holoubek G, Gentsch C | title = Neuropharmacology of the anxiolytic drug opipramol, a sigma site ligand | journal = Pharmacopsychiatry | volume = 37 | issue = Suppl 3 | pages = S189–197 |date=November 2004 | pmid = 15547785 | doi = 10.1055/s-2004-832677 | url = }}</ref> Although it is a member of the [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s (TCAs), opipramol is [[atypical antidepressant|atypical]] among TCAs and its primary [[mechanism of action]] is much different in comparison.<ref name="pmid15547785" /> Most TCAs act as [[monoamine reuptake inhibitor]]s, but opipramol does not, and instead acts primarily as a [[sigma receptor]] [[agonist]].<ref name="pmid15547785" /> It is a [[dibenzazepine]] (iminostilbene) [[chemical derivative|derivative]]. Opipramol was developed by Schindler and Blattner in 1961.<ref name="pmid14270525">{{cite journal | vauthors = Grosser HH, Ryan E | title = Drug Treatment of Anxiety: A Controlled Study of Opipramol and Chlordiazepoxide | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 111 | issue = 471 | pages = 134–141 | year = 1965 | pmid = 14270525 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.111.471.134 | issn = 0007-1250 | url = http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/111/471/134}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
Opipramol is typically used in the treatment of [[generalized anxiety disorder]] (GAD) and [[somatoform disorder]]s.<ref name="MohapatraRath2013" /><ref name="pmid11199949" /> Its anxiolysis becomes prominent after only one to two weeks of chronic administration. Upon first commencing treatment, opipramol is rather [[sedation|sedating]] in nature due to its [[antihistamine]] properties, but this effect becomes less prominent with time.

==Contraindications==
* In patients with [[hypersensitivity reaction|hypersensitivity]] to opipramol or an other component of the formulation
* Acute [[drinking alcohol|alcohol]], [[sedative]], [[analgesic]], and [[antidepressant]] intoxications
* Acute [[urinary retention]]
* Acute [[delirium]]
* Untreated [[glaucoma|narrow-angle glaucoma]]
* [[Benign prostatic hyperplasia]] with residual [[urinary retention]]
* [[Paralytic ileus]]
* Pre-existing higher-grade [[atrioventricular block]]ages or [[supraventricular tachycardia|diffuse supraventricular]] or [[electrical conduction system of the heart|ventricular stimulus]] conduction disturbances
* Combination with [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]] (MAOI)

===Pregnancy and lactation===
Experimental animal studies did not indicate injurious effects of opipramol on the [[human embryogenesis|embryonic development]] or [[fertility]]. Opipramol should only be prescribed during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester, for compelling indication.
It should not be used during [[lactation]] and [[breastfeeding]], since it passes into [[breast milk]] in small quantities.

==Side effects==
Opipramol is a well-[[tolerability|tolerated]] drug and is said to produce fewer [[side effect]]s than [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs) and [[serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] (SNRIs).

The frequently (≥1% to <10%) reported adverse reactions with opipramol especially at the beginning of the treatment include [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[dry mouth]], blocked nose, [[hypotension]], and orthostatic dysregulation.

The adverse reactions reported occasionally(≥0.1% to <1%) include [[dizziness]], [[stupor]], [[micturition]] disturbances, [[accommodation (eye)|accommodation disturbances]], [[tremor]], [[weight gain]], thirst, allergic skin reactions (rash, urticaria), abnormal [[ejaculation]], [[erectile dysfunction|erectile impotence]], [[constipation]], transient increases in liver enzyme activities, [[tachycardia]], and [[palpitation]]s.

Rarely (≥0.01% to <0.1%) reported adverse reaction includes excitation, headache, paresthesia especially in elderly patients, [[psychomotor agitation|restlessness]], [[sweating]], [[sleep disorder|sleep disturbances]], [[edema]], [[galactorrhea]], urine blockage, [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], collapse conditions, stimulation conducting disturbances, intensification of present heart insufficiency, blood profile changes particularly [[leukopenia]], [[confusion]], [[delirium]], stomach complaints, taste disturbance, and [[ileus|paralytic ileus]] especially with sudden discontinuation of a longer-term high-dose therapy.

Very rarely (<0.01%) adverse reaction includes [[seizures]], [[motor disorder]], ([[akathisia]], [[dyskinesia]]), [[ataxia]], [[polyneuropathy]], [[glaucoma]], [[anxiety]], [[hair loss]], [[agranulocytosis]], severe liver dysfunction after long-term treatment, [[jaundice]], and chronic liver damage.

==Overdose==
{{Main|Tricyclic antidepressant overdose}}

Symptoms of intoxication from [[overdose]] include drowsiness, insomnia, stupor, agitation, coma, transient confusion, increased anxiety, ataxia, convulsions, oliguria, anuria, tachycardia or bradycardia, arrhythmia, AV block, hypotension, shock, respiratory depression, and, rarely, cardiac arrest.

As therapy of intoxication, specific [[antidote]] is not available, removal of the drug by [[vomiting]] or [[gastric lavage]] should be done. Continuous cardiovascular monitoring for at least 48 hours should be done. In case of [[respiratory failure]] due to overdose, [[intubation]] and [[artificial respiration]] should be done. During severe hypotension due to overdose, corresponding [[recovery position|recumbent positioning]], plasma expander, [[dopamine (medication)|dopamine]] or [[dobutamine]] as drops-infusion should be initiated. In heart rhythm disturbances, individualized treatment should be done where appropriate pacemaker and compensation in low potassium levels and possible [[acidosis]] should be done. While in convulsions due to overdose, administration of intravenous [[diazepam]] or another anticonvulsant agent such as [[phenobarbital]] or [[paraldehyde]] should be done though intensification of existing respiratory insufficiency, hypotension, or coma may happen.

==Interactions==
The therapy with opipramol indicates an additional therapy with [[antipsychotic]]s, [[hypnotic]]s, and other anxiolytics (e.g. [[barbiturate]]s, [[benzodiazepine]]s). Therefore, it should be noted that some specific reactions, particularly [[central nervous system]] [[depressant]] effects, could be intensified and an intensification of common side effects may occur. If necessary the dosage may be reduced. Co-administration with [[drinking alcohol|alcohol]] can cause [[stupor]].

MAOIs should be discontinued at least 14 days before the treatment with opipramol. Concomitant use of opipramol with [[beta blocker]]s, [[antiarrhythmic agent|antiarrhythmic]]s (of [[Antiarrhythmic agent#Class I agents|class 1c]]), as well as drugs from the TCA group and preparations which influence the [[microsome|microsomal enzyme system]], can lead to changes in plasma concentrations of these drugs. Co-administration of antipsychotics (e.g., [[haloperidol]], [[risperidone]]) can increase the plasma concentration of opipramol. Barbiturates and [[anticonvulsant]]s can reduce the plasma concentration of opipramol and thereby weaken the therapeutic effect.

Opipramol acts as a high [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] [[sigma receptor]] [[agonist]], primarily of the [[sigma-1 receptor|σ<sub>1</sub>]] subtype, but also of the [[sigma-2 receptor|σ<sub>2</sub>]] subtype with lower affinity.<ref name="pmid11199949" /><ref name="MohapatraRath2013">{{cite journal|last1=Mohapatra|first1=S|last2=Rath|first2=NM|last3=Agrawal|first3=A|last4=Verma|first4=J|title=Opipramol: A Novel Drug|journal=Delhi Psychiatry Journal|date=October 2013|volume=16|issue=2|pages=409–411|url=http://medind.nic.in/daa/t13/i2/daat13i2p409.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> In one study of σ<sub>1</sub> receptor [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]]s that also included [[haloperidol]], [[pentazocine]], [[(+)-3-PPP]], [[ditolylguanidine]], [[dextromethorphan]], [[SKF-10,047]] ((±)-alazocine), [[ifenprodil]], [[progesterone]], and others, opipramol showed the highest affinity (K<sub>i</sub> = 0.2–0.3) for the [[guinea pig]] σ<sub>1</sub> receptor of all the tested ligands except haloperidol, which it was approximately [[equipotent]] with.<ref name="pmid8755605" /> The sigma receptor agonism of opipramol is thought to be responsible for its therapeutic benefits against anxiety and depression.<ref name="pmid15547785" /><ref name="MohapatraRath2013" />

Unlike other TCAs, opipramol does not [[reuptake inhibitor|inhibit]] the [[reuptake]] of [[serotonin]] or [[norepinephrine]].<ref name="MohapatraRath2013" /> However, it does act as a high affinity [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of the [[histamine]] [[H1 receptor|H<sub>1</sub> receptor]]<ref name="pmid22033803" /> and as a low to moderate affinity antagonist of the [[dopamine]] [[D2 receptor|D<sub>2</sub>]], [[serotonin]] [[5-HT2 receptor|5-HT<sub>2</sub>]], and [[alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor]]s.<ref name="MohapatraRath2013" /><ref name="pmid14523629" /> H<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonism accounts for its [[antihistamine]] effects and associated [[sedative]] side effects.<ref name="pmid11199949" /><ref name="MohapatraRath2013" /> In contrast to other TCAs, opipramol has very low affinity for the [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor]]s and virtually no [[anticholinergic]] effects.<ref name="pmid14523629" /><ref name="BotanaLoza2012">{{cite book|author1=Luis M.

Sigma receptors are a set of [[protein]]s located in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]].<ref name="MohapatraRath2013" /> σ<sub>1</sub> receptors play key role in potentiating intracellular calcium mobilization thereby acting as sensor or modulator of calcium signaling.<ref name="MohapatraRath2013" /> Occupancy of σ<sub>1</sub> receptors by agonists causes translocation of the receptor from endoplasmic reticulum to peripheral areas (membranes) where the σ<sub>1</sub> receptors cause [[neurotransmitter]] release.<ref name="MohapatraRath2013" /> Opipramol is said to have a biphasic action, with prompt initial improvement of tension, anxiety, and insomnia followed by improved mood later.<ref name="MohapatraRath2013" /> Hence, it is an anxiolytic with an antidepressant component.<ref name="MohapatraRath2013" /> After sub-chronic treatment with opipramol, σ<sub>2</sub> receptors are significantly [[downregulated]] but σ<sub>1</sub> receptors are not.<ref name="MohapatraRath2013" />

===Pharmacokinetics===
Opipramol is rapidly and completely [[absorption (pharmacokinetics)|absorbed]] by the [[gastrointestinal tract]].<ref name="MohapatraRath2013" /> The [[bioavailability]] of opipramol amounts to 94%.<ref name="MohapatraRath2013" /> After single [[oral administration]] of 50&nbsp;mg, the [[Cmax (pharmacology)|peak plasma concentration]] of the drug is reached after 3.3&nbsp;hours and amounts to 15.6&nbsp;ng/mL.<ref name="MohapatraRath2013" /> After single oral administration of 100&nbsp;mg the maximum plasma concentration is reached after 3&nbsp;hours and amounts to 33.2&nbsp;ng/mL.<ref name="MohapatraRath2013" /> Therapeutic concentrations of opipramol range from 140 to 550&nbsp;nmol/L.<ref name="pmid14708881">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gutteck U, Rentsch KM | title = Therapeutic drug monitoring of 13 antidepressant and five neuroleptic drugs in serum with liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry | journal = Clin.
