'''Lubiprostone''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|rINN]], marketed under the trade name '''Amitiza''' among others) is a [[medication]] used in the management of [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[idiopathic]] [[constipation]], predominantly [[irritable bowel syndrome]]-associated constipation in women and [[opioid-induced constipation]].

It was initially approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 2006 and recommended for use in the by the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.evidence.nhs.uk/formulary/bnf/current/1-gastro-intestinal-system/16-laxatives/167-other-drugs-used-in-constipation#PHP34865|title=Lubiprostone for treating chronic idiopathic constipation - Technology appraisal guidance [TA318]|last=|first=|date=23 July 2014|website=NICE|access-date=13 April 2017}}{{dead link|date=June 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> It is expensive as of 2017, with the cost to the [[National Health Service|NHS]] being £29.68 per 24mg 28-cap pack as of April 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.evidence.nhs.uk/formulary/bnf/current/1-gastro-intestinal-system/16-laxatives/167-other-drugs-used-in-constipation/lubiprostone|title=LUBIPROSTONE - Other drugs used in constipation|last=|first=|date=2014|website=British National Formulary|access-date=13 April 2017}}{{dead link|date=June 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
Lubiprostone is used for the treatment of chronic [[constipation]] of unknown cause in adults, as well as [[irritable bowel syndrome]] associated with constipation in women.<ref name=AHFS>{{cite web|title=Amitiza|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/amitiza.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref>

Lubiprostone is approved to treat chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in adults.

Lubiprostone is also approved to treat [[opioid]]-induced constipation, in adults with chronic non-cancer pain. The effectiveness of lubiprostone has not been established in patients who are taking a diphenylheptane opioid (e.g., methadone).

Lubiprostone is approved to treat irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) in women 18 years of age and older.

As of 12 November 2014, lubiprostone has not been studied in children. There is current research underway to determine the safety and efficacy in postoperative bowel dysfunction.

==Adverse effects==
In clinical trials, the most common adverse event was [[nausea]] (31%). Other adverse events (≥5% of patients) included [[diarrhea]] (13%), [[headache]] (13%), [[Abdominal distension|abdominal distention]] (5%), [[abdominal pain]] (5%), [[flatulence]] (6%), [[sinusitis]] (5%) [[vomiting]] (5%) and [[fecal incontinence]] (1%).

===Contraindications===
There are no current data on use in people with liver or kidney complications. The effects on pregnancy have not been studied in humans but testing in Guinea pigs resulted in fetal loss. 
Amitiza is not approved for use in children.  Lubiprostone is contraindicated in patients exhibiting chronic [[diarrhea]], [[bowel obstruction]], or diarrhea-predominant [[irritable bowel syndrome]].

==Mechanism of action==
Lubiprostone is a bicyclic [[fatty acid]] derived from [[prostaglandin E1]] that acts by specifically activating [[CLCN2|ClC-2 chloride channels]] on the apical aspect of gastrointestinal [[epithelial]] cells, producing a chloride-rich fluid secretion. These secretions soften the stool, increase motility, and promote spontaneous bowel movements (SBM).

Symptoms of constipation such as pain and bloating are usually improved within one week, and SBM may occur within one day.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Unlike many [[laxative]] products, lubiprostone does not show signs of [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]], [[Chemical dependency|dependency]], or altered serum [[electrolyte]] concentration. There was no rebound effect following withdrawal of treatment, but a gradual return to pre-treatment bowel movement frequency should be expected.

Minimal distribution of the drug occurs beyond the immediate gastrointestinal tissues. Lubiprostone is rapidly metabolized by [[redox|reduction]]/[[oxidation]], mediated by [[carbonyl reductase]]. There is no metabolic involvement of the hepatic [[cytochrome P450]] system. The measurable metabolite, M3, exists in very low levels in plasma and makes up less than 10% of the total administered dose.

Data indicate that metabolism occurs locally in the [[stomach]] and [[jejunum]].

==Society and culture==

===Legal status===
Lubiprostone received approval from the Food and Drug Administration in 2008 to treat irritable bowel syndrome with [[constipation]] (IBS-C) and is available through prescription only.  {{As of|2014}}, the drug is available in the United States, Japan, Switzerland and the United Kingdom; review by [[Health Canada]] began in late 2014.<ref name="house2014">{{cite news | author=House, Douglas W. | date=31 December 2014 | title=Canada accepts Sucampo's NDS for constipation med | publisher=[[Seeking Alpha]] }}</ref>

===Brand names===
In [[Bangladesh]] and [[India]], lubiprostone is marketed under the trade name Lubilax by Beacon Pharmaceuticals Limited, and under the trade name Lubowel by SunPharma.
