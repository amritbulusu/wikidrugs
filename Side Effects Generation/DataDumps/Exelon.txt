==History==
On June 30, 2005, the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] approved the merger of Exelon and [[Public Service Enterprise Group Inc.]], a [[New Jersey]] utility. Under this merger, Exelon would have become the largest utility in the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8419580 |title=FERC approves Exelon-PSEG deal - Business - Oil & energy - msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2005-06-30 |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref> The two companies later broke off the agreement<ref name=autogenerated1>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100127103915/http://www.pseg.com/media_center/pressreleases/articles/2006/2006-09-14b.jsp Press Releases]</ref> due to pressure put on the NJ Board of Public Utilities by public interest groups, including New Jersey Citizen Action.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.njcitizenaction.org/news/util074.html |title=NJCA in the News |publisher=Njcitizenaction.org |date=2006-09-27 |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref> The merger sat pending in front of the NJBPU for nineteen months before Exelon concluded that they were fighting a losing battle.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> On April 28, 2011, Exelon announced a merger with [[Constellation Energy]] for $7.9 billion with the combined company owning more than 34 gigawatts of power generation (55 percent nuclear, 24 percent natural gas, 8 percent renewable including hydro, 7 percent oil and 6 percent coal).<ref name=hydro280411>

In 2012, when announcing the cancellation of new nuclear construction for [[Victoria County Station]], Texas, Exelon stated that economic and market conditions, especially low natural gas prices, made the "construction of new merchant nuclear power plants in competitive markets uneconomical now and for the foreseeable future".<ref name=nei-20120829>{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2062971 |title=Exelon scraps Texas reactor project |newspaper=Nuclear Engineering International |date=29 August 2012 |accessdate=14 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130129162923/http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=2062971 |archivedate=29 January 2013 |df= }}</ref>

Exelon announced the proposed purchase of [[Pepco Holdings]], Inc on April 30, 2014, for $6.8 billion in an all-cash transaction. The merger was rejected by the [[District of Columbia Public Service Commission]] in August 2015, though it was approved by other federal and state regulators. The companies appealled the decision.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Heath|first1=Thomas|title=Pepco, Exelon to appeal D.C. merger rejection|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/pepco-exelon-commit-to-pursuing-merger/2015/08/31/00ae9834-5016-11e5-8c19-0b6825aa4a3a_story.html|accessdate=September 13, 2015|work=The Washington Post|date=August 31, 2015}}</ref>  On March 23, 2016, the merger was approved by the Washington DC Public Service Commission, under a revised set of terms.

===Controversies===

[[PECO Energy]], one of Exelon's local power companies, has been involved in two controversies with activists. In the 1970s, activists delayed the opening of nuclear power plants.<ref>[https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/us-anti-nuclear-activists-partially-block-establishment-nuclear-power-plant-limerick-pa-1977 U.S. Anti-nuclear activists partially block establishment of nuclear power plant in Limerick, PA, 1977-82], Global Nonviolent Action Database, accessed April 6, 2016.</ref> In 2015, Earth Quaker Action Team began a campaign to pressure PECO to expand the solar power it purchases, and to purchase it locally to create jobs.<ref>[https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2016/03/24/quaker-group-says-north-philly-solar-panels-could-meet-peco-power-target-this-year/ Quaker group says North Philly solar panels could meet PECO power target this year]. StateImpact Pennsylvania. Retrieved 2016-04-07.</ref>

Exelon's merger with [[Pepco]] faced stiff opposition from community groups and the D.C. Mayor [[Muriel Bowser]].<ref>[http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-pepco-exelon-merger-in-doubt-20160301-story.html Renewed opposition to Exelon-Pepco merger threatens to scuttle deal], Baltimore Sun, March 2, 2016</ref>

==Pollution, security incidents==
In 2005, Exelon was required to pay a $602,000 fine for exceeding the permitted [[sulfur dioxide]] emission limit from April to October 2004 at its Cromby Generating Station in [[Chester County, Pennsylvania]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jun2005/2005-06-30-09.asp#anchor4 |title=AmeriScan: June 30, 2005 |publisher=Ens-newswire.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref>

Exelon and Illinois state officials waited for four years until 2006 before disclosing that Exelon's [[Braidwood Nuclear Generating Station]], a nuclear plant 60 miles southwest of Chicago, had spilled millions of gallons of water containing [[tritium]], a radioactive form of hydrogen, multiple times over a decade.  Exelon officials eventually apologized and said the risks from the leak were "minimal", with tritium levels in surrounding wells all found to be below regulatory limits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/371152/exelon_admits_its_fault_in_leak_apologetic_officials_call_risk/index.html |title=RedOrbit.com, Exelon admits its fault |publisher=Redorbit.com |date=2006-01-26 |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref>

In 2009, the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] announced its plan for a $65,000 fine against Exelon for permitting its contracted security guards that were guarding its [[Peach Bottom Nuclear Generating Station]], a two-reactor nuclear plant located in Delta, Pennsylvania to sleep on the job. The incidents did not come to light until a videotape of the security guards was leaked to news media.<ref>[http://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML0900/ML090060734.pdf Nuclear Regulatory Commission news release]</ref> As a result, Exelon terminated the security contract of the [[Wackenhut]] security firm that had been involved and now operates its own in-house nuclear security force.
