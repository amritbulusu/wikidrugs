'''Perifosine''' (also '''KRX-0401''') is a drug candidate being developed for a variety of cancer indications.
It is an alkyl-[[phospholipid]]<ref name=Kond2003>{{cite journal |url=http://mct.aacrjournals.org/content/2/11/1093.full |title=Perifosine, a novel alkylphospholipid, inhibits protein kinase B activation |date=Nov 2003 |publisher=Mol Cancer Ther |author=Kondapaka|display-authors=etal}}</ref> structurally related to [[miltefosine]]. It acts as an [[Akt inhibitor]] and a [[PI3K inhibitor]].
It was being developed by Keryx Biopharmaceuticals who have licensed it from [[Ã†terna Zentaris]] Inc.<ref name=SO-2010>[http://smartoncology.com/PDF_Issue2/Smartoncology%20February%2026%20Issue%202.pdf Smartoncology newsletter], Feb 2010</ref>

In 2010 perifosine has reached phase II.<ref>June 7, 2010: Presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting of Phase I data on single agent perifosine in the treatment of recurrent pediatric solid tumors, including patients with advanced brain tumors and neuroblastoma. also [http://www.asco.org/ASCOv2/Meetings/Abstracts?&vmview=abst_detail_view&confID=55&abstractID=33476 Phase II trial of the novel oral Akt inhibitor perifosine in relapsed and/or refractory Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM).]</ref> In one phase II trial for metastatic [[colon cancer]] perifosine doubled [[time to progression]].<ref name=SO-2010/>

It has [[orphan drug]] status in the U.S. for the treatment of multiple myeloma and [[neuroblastoma]], and for multiple myeloma in the EU.<ref name=Mar2011/>

In 2011 it was in a phase III trial for [[colorectal cancer]],<ref>http://www.clinicaltrial.gov/ct2/show/NCT01097018</ref> and another for [[multiple myeloma]].<ref name=Mar2011>{{cite news |url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/yakult-pays-aeterna-zentaris-8-3m-for-japanese-rights-to-pivotal-stage-cancer-drug/81244795/ |title=Yakult Pays Aeterna Zentaris $8.3M for Japanese Rights to Pivotal-Stage Cancer Drug |date=9 March 2011 }}</ref><ref>http://www.clinicaltrial.gov/ct2/show/NCT01002248</ref>  On April 2, 2012, it was announced that perifosine failed its phase III clinical trial for treatment of colon cancer.<ref name=May2012>{{cite news |url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/aeterna-zentaris-regains-north-american-rights-to-akt-inhibitor-from-keryx/81246731/ |title=Aeterna Zentaris Regains North American Rights to Akt Inhibitor from Keryx |date=May 2012 }}</ref> Detailed results were released in June 2012.<ref name=AZ201206>{{cite web |url=http://www.aezsinc.com/en/page.php?p=60&q=508 |title=Aeterna Zentaris: Phase 3 Data for Perifosine in Colorectal Cancer Presented at ASCO Meeting |date=4 June 2012 }}</ref> On March 11, 2013 Aeterna Zentaris announced the discontinuing of Phase 3 clinical trial of perifosine for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma http://www.aezsinc.com/en/page.php?p=60&q=550.
