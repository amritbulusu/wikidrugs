'''Nimetazepam''' (marketed under brand name '''Erimin and Lavol''') is an intermediate-acting [[hypnotic]] drug which is a [[benzodiazepine]] derivative. It was first synthesized by a team at Hoffmann-La Roche in 1962.<ref>

}}</ref> It is sold in 5&nbsp;mg tablets known as Erimin and Lavol. It is generally prescribed for the short-term treatment of [[Insomnia#Benzodiazepines|severe insomnia]] in patients who have difficulty falling asleep or maintaining sleep. The sole global manufacturer of Nimetazepam (Sumitomo Japan) has ceased manufacturing '''Erimin''' since early November 2015. Patients being prescribed '''Erimin''' are being switched to '''Lavol''' and other hypnotics, e.g. [[estazolam]], [[nitrazepam]], [[flunitrazepam]], etc.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Taken orally, Nimetazepam has very good bioavailability with nearly 100% being absorbed from the gut. It is among the most rapidly absorbed and quickest acting oral benzodiazepines, and hypnotic effects are typically felt within 15–30 minutes after oral ingestion. The blood level decline of the parent drug was biphasic with the short half-life ranging from 0.5–0.7 hours and the terminal half-life from 8 to 26.5 hours (mean 17.25 hours).{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} It is the ''N''-methylated analogue of [[nitrazepam]] (Mogadon, Alodorm), to which it is partially metabolized. [[nitrazepam]] has a long elimination half-life, so effects of repeated dosage tend to be cumulative.

==Recreational use==
{{See also|Benzodiazepine drug misuse}}
There is a risk of misuse and dependence in both patients and non-medical users of Nimetazepam. The pharmacological properties of Nimetazepam such as high affinity binding, high potency, being short to intermediate - acting and having a rapid onset of action increase the abuse potential of Nimetazepam. The physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome of Nimetazepam also adds to the addictive nature of Nimetazepam.

Nimetazepam has a particular reputation in the Malay Peninsula for recreational use, at [[Malaysian ringgit|RM]] 25 per tab, and is particularly popular among persons addicted to [[substituted amphetamine|amphetamines]] or [[opioid]]s.<ref>{{ cite journal | last1 = Chong | first1 = Y.

==Drug Misuse==
Nimetazepam has a reputation for being particularly subject to abuse (known as 'Happy 5', sold as an ecstasy replacement without a hangover). Although is still a significant drug of abuse in some Asian countries such as [[Japan]] and [[Malaysia]], Nimetazepam is subject to legal restrictions in Malaysia, and due to its [[scarcity]], many tablets sold on the black market are in fact counterfeits containing other [[benzodiazepines]] such as [[diazepam]] or [[nitrazepam]] instead.<ref>{{Cite journal

==Legal status==
In United State of America, Nimetazepam is categorized '''''Schedule IV''''' [[FDA]] and [[DEA]].

Nimetazepam is currently a [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Schedules of Controlled Substances|Schedule IV]] drug under the international [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]] of 1971.<ref>{{ cite web | work = Green List Annex to the annual statistical report on psychotropic substances (form P) | title = List of psychotropic substances under international control | url = http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/green.pdf | format = pdf | edition = 23rd | date = August 2003 | publisher = International Narcotics Control Board | accessdate = 2011-12-06}}</ref>

In [[Singapore]], Nimetazepam is medical prescribed drugs, is regulated under the [[Misuse of Drugs Act (Singapore)|Misuse of Drugs Act]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Misuse of drugs act, chapter 185 | url = http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_retrieve.pl?actno=REVED-185 }}</ref> The illegal possession or consumption of Nimetazepam is punishable by up to 10 years of imprisonment, a fine of 20,000 Singapore dollars, or both illegally importing or exporting nimetazepam is punishable by up to 20 years of imprisonment and caning.

In [[Hong Kong]], Nimetazepam is regulated under Schedule 1 of [[Hong Kong|Hong Kong's]] Chapter 134 ''Dangerous Drugs Ordinance''. Nimetazepam can only be used legally by health professionals and for university research purposes. The substance can be given by pharmacists under a prescription. Anyone who supplies the substance without prescription can be fined $10000 (HKD). The penalty for trafficking or manufacturing the substance is a $5,000,000 ([[Hong Kong dollar|HKD]]) fine and life imprisonment. Possession of the substance for consumption without license from the Department of Health is illegal with a $1,000,000 (HKD) fine and/or 7 years of jail time.<ref>{{cite web | title = Bilingual Laws Information System | url = http://www.legislation.gov.hk/eng/index.htm | publisher = The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China
}}</ref>

Similarly in [[Taiwan]] and Indonesia Nimetazepam is also regulated as a controlled prescribed substance.

In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] [[Australia]], nimetazepam is regulated under Schedule 11 of "Drugs, Poisons and Controlled substances act 1981". It is deemed to fall under the category of "7-NITRO-1,4-BENZODIAZEPINES not included elsewhere in this Part". .<ref>{{cite web | title = Victorian Legislation and Parliamentary Documents | url = http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/PubLawToday.nsf/imgPDF | publisher = The State Government Victoria}}</ref>

==Toxicity==
In a rat study Nimetazepam showed greater damage to the fetus, as did [[nitrazepam]] when compared against other benzodiazepines, all at a dosage of 100&nbsp;mg/kg. [[Diazepam]] however showed relatively weak fetal toxicities.<ref>

In a rat study nimetazepam showed slight enlargement of the liver and adrenals and atrophy of the testes and ovaries were found in high dose groups of both drugs at the 4th and 12th week, however, in histopathological examination, there were no change in the liver, adrenals and ovaries. Degenerative changes of seminiferous epithelium in the testes were observed, but these atrophic change returned to normal by withdrawal of the drugs for 12 weeks.<ref>{{Cite journal
