ADHD and other similar conditions are believed to be linked to sub-performance of the [[dopamine]] and [[norepinephrine]] functions in the brain, primarily in the [[prefrontal cortex]], responsible for [[executive function]] (e.g., [[verbal reasoning|reasoning]], [[Cognitive inhibition|inhibiting behaviors]], [[Organizing (management)|organizing]], [[problem solving]], [[planning]], etc.).<ref name='cortex'>{{cite web | url = http://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/523887_4 | title = Functional Roles of Norepinephrine and Dopamine in ADHD: Dopamine in ADHD | accessdate = 8 October 2013 | year = 2006 | work = Medscape|quote=<!--Catecholamines not only facilitate attention, they are essential to executive function. The prefrontal cortex directs behaviors, thoughts, and feelings represented in working memory. This representational knowledge is essential to fundamental cognitive abilities that compromise executive functions. These encompass the ability to (1) inhibit inappropriate behaviors and thoughts, (2) regulate our attention, (3) monitor our actions, and (4) plan and organize for the future. Difficulties with these prefrontal cortex functions are evident in neuropsychological and imaging studies of ADHD patients and account for many of the common behavioral symptoms. Measures of prefrontal cortical functioning in animals indicate that these functions are sensitive to small changes in catecholamine modulation of prefrontal cortex cells that can produce profound effects on the ability of the prefrontal cortex to guide behavior. Optimal levels of NE acting at postsynaptic alpha2A-adrenoceptors and dopamine acting at D1 receptors are essential to prefrontal cortex function. Blockade of norepinephrine alpha2-adrenoceptors in prefrontal cortex markedly impairs prefrontal cortex function and mimics most of the symptoms of ADHD, including impulsivity and locomotor hyperactivity. Conversely, stimulation of prefrontal cortical alpha2-adrenoceptors strengthens prefrontal cortex regulation of behavior and reduces distractibility. Thus, effective treatments for ADHD facilitate catecholamine transmission and apparently have their therapeutic actions by optimizing catecholamine actions in the prefrontal cortex-->}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Arnsten AF, Li BM | title = Neurobiology of Executive Functions: Catecholamine Influences on Prefrontal Cortical Functions | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 57 | issue = 11 | pages = 1377–84 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15950011 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2004.08.019 }}</ref> Methylphenidate's [[mechanism of action]] involves the inhibition of [[catecholamine]] [[reuptake]], primarily as a [[dopamine reuptake inhibitor]].

In 2015, a [[systematic review]] and a [[meta-analysis]] of high quality [[clinical trial]]s found that therapeutic doses of [[amphetamine]] and methylphenidate result in modest yet unambiguous improvements in [[cognition]], including [[working memory]], [[episodic memory]], and [[inhibitory control]], in normal healthy adults;<ref name="Unambiguous PFC D1 A2">{{cite journal | vauthors = Spencer RC, Devilbiss DM, Berridge CW | title = The Cognition-Enhancing Effects of Psychostimulants Involve Direct Action in the Prefrontal Cortex | journal = Biol.

Surprisingly, despite nearly 80 years of clinical use, the neurobiology of the procognitive actions of psychostimulants has only recently been systematically investigated. Findings from this research unambiguously demonstrate that the cognition-enhancing effects of psychostimulants involve the preferential elevation of catecholamines in the PFC and the subsequent activation of norepinephrine α2 and dopamine D1 receptors.&nbsp;... This differential modulation of PFC-dependent processes across dose appears to be associated with the differential involvement of noradrenergic α2 versus α1 receptors. Collectively, this evidence indicates that at low, clinically relevant doses, psychostimulants are devoid of the behavioral and neurochemical actions that define this class of drugs and instead act largely as cognitive enhancers (improving PFC-dependent function). This information has potentially important clinical implications as well as relevance for public health policy regarding the widespread clinical use of psychostimulants and for the development of novel pharmacologic treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and other conditions associated with PFC dysregulation. | pmc=4377121}}</ref><ref name="Cognitive and motivational effects">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ilieva IP, Hook CJ, Farah MJ | title = Prescription Stimulants' Effects on Healthy Inhibitory Control, Working Memory, and Episodic Memory: A Meta-analysis | journal = J.

==== Ethics of use for performance enhancement ====
Methylphenidate is sometimes used by students to enhance their mental abilities, improving their [[attentional control|concentration]] and helping them to study.

[[John Harris (bioethicist)|John Harris]], an expert in [[bioethics]], has said that it would be unethical to stop healthy people taking the drug. He pointed out the logical [[non sequitur (logic)|non sequitur]] which would result if people were to draw a parallel between the claims of a university that they could "set out deliberately to improve the mental capacities of its students; suppose its stated aims were to ensure that students left the university more intelligent and learned than when they arrived. Suppose they further claimed that not only could they achieve this but that their students would be more intelligent and mentally alert than any students in history."  He then asked the rhetorical question of whether, "if the claims could be sustained, should we be pleased?"  He argues that it would be "not rational" and against human enhancement to not use the drug to improve people's cognitive abilities.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Harris J | title = Is it acceptable for people to take methylphenidate to enhance performance?

[[Barbara Sahakian]] has argued that the use of Ritalin in this way may give students an unfair advantage in examinations and that as a result universities may want to discuss making students give [[urine samples]] to be tested for the drug.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/feb/21/smart-drugs-students-universities|title=Universities told to consider dope tests as student use of 'smart drugs' soars|last=Davies|first=Caroline|date=21 February 2010 |work=[[The Observer]]|accessdate=21 February 2010|location=London}}</ref>

However, meta analysis of available data suggests that treatment of ADHD with stimulant drugs may have a significant protective effect, reducing the risk for addictive substance use (36, 37). Studies with juvenile rats have also indicated that repeated exposure to methylphenidate does not necessarily lead to enhanced drug-seeking behavior in adulthood (38). However, the recent increase of methylphenidate use as a cognitive enhancer by the general public has again raised concerns because of its potential for abuse and addiction (3, 6–10). Thus, although oral administration of clinical doses of methylphenidate is not associated with euphoria or with abuse problems, nontherapeutic use of high doses or i.v. administration may lead to addiction (39, 40).}}</ref>

==== Biomolecular mechanisms ====
{{details|Addiction#Biomolecular mechanisms}}
Methylphenidate has the potential to induce [[euphoria]] due to its [[pharmacodynamic]] effect (i.e., [[dopamine reuptake inhibitor|dopamine reuptake inhibition]]) in the brain's [[reward system]].<ref name="MPH ΔFosB" /> At therapeutic doses, ADHD stimulants do not sufficiently activate the reward system, or the [[reward pathway]] in particular, to the extent necessary to cause persistent increases in [[ΔFosB]] [[gene expression]] in the [[D1-type]] [[medium spiny neurons]] of the [[nucleus accumbens]];<ref name="MPH - addiction" /><ref name="MPH ΔFosB" /><ref name="Cellular basis" /> consequently, when taken as directed in doses that are commonly prescribed for the treatment of ADHD, methylphenidate use lacks the capacity to cause an [[addiction]].<ref name="MPH - addiction">{{cite book |vauthors=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE |veditors=Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 9780071481274 | page = 368 | edition = 2nd | chapter = Chapter 15: Reinforcement and Addictive Disorders | quote = Cocaine, [amphetamine], and methamphetamine are the major psychostimulants of abuse. The related drug methylphenidate is also abused, although it is far less potent. These drugs elicit similar initial subjective effects ; differences generally reflect the route of administration and other pharmacokinetic factors. Such agents also have important therapeutic uses; cocaine, for example, is used as a local anesthetic (Chapter 2), and amphetamines and methylphenidate are used in low doses to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and in higher doses to treat narcolepsy (Chapter 12). Despite their clinical uses, these drugs are strongly reinforcing, and their long-term use at high doses is linked with potential addiction, especially when they are rapidly administered or when high-potency forms are given. }}</ref><ref name="MPH ΔFosB" /><ref name="Cellular basis" /> However, when methylphenidate is used at sufficiently high recreational doses through a bioavailable [[route of administration]] (e.g., [[insufflation (medicine)|insufflation]] or [[intravenous administration]]), particularly for use of the drug as a [[euphoriant]], ΔFosB accumulates in the [[nucleus accumbens]].<ref name="MPH - addiction" /><ref name="MPH ΔFosB" /> Hence, like any other addictive drug, regular recreational use of methylphenidate at high doses eventually gives rise to ΔFosB overexpression in D1-type neurons which subsequently triggers a series of [[gene transcription]]-mediated [[signaling cascade]]s that induce an addiction.<ref name="MPH ΔFosB" /><ref name="Cellular basis">{{cite journal | author = Nestler EJ | title = Cellular basis of memory for addiction | journal = Dialogues Clin.

The formation of ΔFosB in multiple brain regions, and the molecular pathway leading to the formation of AP-1 complexes is well understood. The establishment of a functional purpose for ΔFosB has allowed further determination as to some of the key aspects of its molecular cascades, involving effectors such as GluR2 (87,88), Cdk5 (93) and NFkB (100). Moreover, many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the structural, physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure (60,95,97,102). New frontiers of research investigating the molecular roles of ΔFosB have been opened by epigenetic studies, and recent advances have illustrated the role of ΔFosB acting on DNA and histones, truly as a ‘‘molecular switch’’ (34). As a consequence of our improved understanding of ΔFosB in addiction, it is possible to evaluate the addictive potential of current medications (119), as well as use it as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions (121,122,124). Some of these proposed interventions have limitations (125) or are in their infancy (75). However, it is hoped that some of these preliminary findings may lead to innovative treatments, which are much needed in addiction.}}<br />'''•''' {{cite journal | vauthors = Biliński P, Wojtyła A, Kapka-Skrzypczak L, Chwedorowicz R, Cyranka M, Studziński T | title = Epigenetic regulation in drug addiction | journal = Ann.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
{{Further information|#Available forms}}
Methylphenidate taken orally has a [[bioavailability]] of 11–52% with a duration of peak action around 2–4&nbsp;hours for instant release (i.e. Ritalin), 3–8&nbsp;hours for [[modified-release dosage (medicine)|sustained release]] (i.e. Ritalin SR), and 8–12&nbsp;hours for extended release (i.e. Concerta). The [[biological half-life|half-life]] of methylphenidate is 2–3&nbsp;hours, depending on the individual. The peak plasma time is achieved at about 2&nbsp;hours.<ref name="pmid10628897"/>

Dextromethylphenidate is much more bioavailable than levomethylphenidate when administered orally, and is primarily responsible for the psychoactivity of [[racemic]] methylphenidate.<ref name="pmid10628897"/>

=== Detection in biological fluids ===

The concentration of methylphenidate or [[ritalinic acid]], its major metabolite, may be quantified in plasma, serum or whole blood in order to monitor compliance in those receiving the drug therapeutically, to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdosage.<ref>R.

[[File:Ritalin Methylphenidat.jpg|thumb|German "Ritalin" brand methylphenidate]]
Methylphenidate is produced in the [[United States]], [[Mexico]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Pakistan]], and [[India]]. It is also sold in [[Canada]], [[Australia]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Spain]], [[Germany]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Portugal]], [[Argentina]], [[Thailand]], and several other European countries (although in much lower volumes than in the United States). Brand names for methylphenidate include Ritalin, Concerta, Aptensio, Biphentin, Daytrana, Equasym, Medikinet, Metadate, Methylin, and Quillivant. Generic forms are produced by numerous pharmaceutical companies throughout the world. In Belgium the product is sold under the name Rilatine and in Brazil, Portugal and Argentina as Ritalina. In Thailand, it is found under the name Hynidate. In India, it is found under the names Addwize and Inspiral SR.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Methylphenidate is available in numerous forms, a doctor will determine the appropriate formulation of the drug to prescribe based on the patient's history, the doctor's experiences treating other patients with methylphenidate products, and product pricing/availability. Currently available forms include a variety of tablets and capsules, an adhesive-based matrix transdermal system (transdermal patch), and an oral suspension (liquid syrup).

The [[dextrorotary]] [[enantiomer]] of methylphenidate, known as [[dexmethylphenidate]], is sold as a generic and under the brand names Focalin and Attenade in both an immediate-release and an extended-release form. In some circumstances it may be prescribed instead of methylphenidate, however it has no significant advantages over methylphenidate at equipotent dosages and so it is sometimes considered to be an example of an [[Evergreening|evergreened]] drug.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lehmann|first1=David F.|last2=Wojnowicz|first2=Sarabeth|title=The Evergreening of Biopharmaceuticals: Time to Defoliate|journal=The Journal of Clinical Pharmacology|date=April 2016|volume=56|issue=4|pages=383–389|doi=10.1002/jcph.642}}</ref>

=== Cost ===
[[File:Ritalin Pill.jpg|thumb|Ritalin 10 mg tablet]]

Generic immediate-release methylphenidate is relatively inexpensive. The average wholesale cost is about US$0.15 per [[defined daily dose]] ([[Pharmacy#Community pharmacy|retail pharmacies]] normally charge more).<ref>Based on: {{cite web|title=Methylphenidate Hydrochloride|url=http://erc.msh.org/dmpguide/resultsdetail.cfm?language=english&code=MEP10T&s_year=2014&year=2014&str=10%20mg&desc=Methylphenidate%20Hydrochloride&pack=new&frm=TAB-CAP&rte=PO&class_code2=24%2E2%2E&supplement=&class_name=%2824%2E2%2E%29Medicines%20used%20in%20mood%20disorders%3Cbr%3E%3Cbr%3E|website=International Drug Price Indicator Guide|accessdate=9 May 2016}}</ref><!-- One defined daily dose is 30 mg. If you need one defined daily dose, you'll need to take three 10-mg tablets. The median price of each 10-mg tablet is 0.0543 USD. Note that a defined daily dose is only a guideline, and that many patients need more or less than 30 mg per day. --> However, the most expensive brand-name extended-release tablets may retail for as much as $12.40 per defined daily dose.<ref>The [//www.healthinfo.moh.gov.on.ca/formulary/ Ontario Drug Benefit online formulary] indicates that, in Ontario, Canada, the local most-expensive methylphenidate product is probably Concerta. Drug prices in the US are often higher than in Canada. The GoodRx website correctly points out that short-term refills (e.g. 30 tablets) often cost more per tablet than longer-term refills (e.g. 90 tablets). For 30 tablets of brand-name Concerta 27 mg, the relevant [http://www.goodrx.com/concerta?form=tablet&dosage=27mg&quantity=30&days_supply=&label_override=Concerta GoodRx webpage] offers coupons. However, if a patient ignores the coupons, and if the patient does not shop around, the website indicates that it is possible to pay more than twelve US dollars per defined daily dose. Data retrieved 17 May 2016.</ref>

There are two main reasons for this price difference:

* Generic formulations are less expensive than brand-name formulations.
* Immediate-release tablets are less expensive than 8-hour extended-release tablets, which are much less expensive than 12-hour extended-release tablets.

Methylphenidate was first [[Chemical synthesis|synthesized]] in 1944,<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Panizzon L | title = La preparazione di piridile piperidil-arilacetonitrili e di alcuni prodotti di trasformazione (Parte Ia) | journal = Helvetica Chimica Acta | volume = 27 | pages = 1748–56 | year = 1944 | doi = 10.1002/hlca.194402701222}}</ref> and was identified as a stimulant in 1954.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Meier R, Gross F, Tripod J | title = Ritalin, a new synthetic compound with specific analeptic components | journal = Klinische Wochenschrift | volume = 32 | issue = 19–20 | pages = 445–50 | year = 1954 | pmid = 13164273 | doi = 10.1007/BF01466968 }}</ref>

Methylphenidate was synthesized by Ciba (now [[Novartis]]) chemist Leandro Panizzon. He named the drug after his wife, nicknamed Rita, who used Ritalin to compensate for low blood pressure.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a4DuGVwyN6cC&pg=PA178&lpg=PA178&dq=named+ritalin+after+his+wife#v=onepage&q=named%20ritalin%20after%20his%20wife&f=false|title=The 100 Most Important Chemical Compounds: A Reference Guide|last=Myers|first=Richard Leroy|date=1 January 2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=|isbn=9780313337581|location=|pages=178|language=en|quote=|via=Google books}}</ref>

Originally it was marketed as a mixture of two racemates, 80% (±)-erythro and 20% (±)-threo. Subsequent studies of the racemates showed that the central stimulant activity is associated with the threo racemate and were focused on the separation and interconversion of the erythro isomer into the more active threo isomer.<ref>Leandro Panizzon et al ''Pyridine and piperdjine compounds'' {{US patent|2,507,631}} Issue date: 16 May 1950</ref><ref>Rudolf Rouietscji et al ''Process for the conversion of'' {{US patent|2838519}} Issue date: 10 June 1958</ref><ref>Rudolf Rouietscji et al''Process for the conversion of'' {{US patent|2,957,880}} Issue date: 25 October 1960</ref>
