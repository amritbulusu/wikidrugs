'''Captodiame''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]), also known as '''captodiamine''', is an [[antihistamine]] sold under the trade names '''Covatine''', '''Covatix''', and '''Suvren''' which is used as a [[sedative]] and [[anxiolytic]]. It is a [[chemical derivative|derivative]] of [[diphenhydramine]].<ref name=Mercier-Guyon/>

A 2004 study suggested captodiame may be helpful in preventing [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]] in people discontinuing [[benzodiazepine]] treatment.<ref name=Mercier-Guyon>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mercier-Guyon C, Chabannes JP, Saviuc P |title=The role of captodiamine in the withdrawal from long-term benzodiazepine treatment |journal=Curr Med Res Opin |volume=20 |issue=9 |pages=1347–55 |year=2004 |pmid=15383182 |doi=10.1185/030079904125004457}} [http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/489359 Free full text with registration]</ref>

In addition to its actions as an antihistamine, captodiamine has been found to act as a [[5-HT2C receptor|5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] and [[sigma-1 receptor|σ<sub>1</sub> receptor]] and [[D3 receptor|D<sub>3</sub> receptor]] [[agonist]].<ref name="pmid23863923">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ring RM, Regan CM | title = Captodiamine, a putative antidepressant, enhances hypothalamic BDNF expression in vivo by synergistic 5-HT2c receptor antagonism and sigma-1 receptor agonism | journal = J.

==Synthesis==
The oxygen atom in these molecules can in many cases be dispensed with as well; substitution of sulfur for nitrogen affords a molecule whose salient biologic properties are those of a sedative and tranquilizer.

[[Friedel-Crafts]] acylation of the n-butyl ether of thiophenol with [[benzoyl chloride]] gives the corresponding [[benzophenone]]. Reduction of the ketone with zinc/NaOH followed by treatment with HCl in ether affords the benzhydryl chloride. Displacement of the halogen with [[thiourea]] gives, by reaction of the last at its most nucleophilic center, the [[isothiouronium]] salt. Hydrolysis of the salt leads to the sulfur analog of a benzhydrol. Alkylation of the sodium salt of this last with ''N''-(2-chloroethyl)dimethylamine affords captodiame.
