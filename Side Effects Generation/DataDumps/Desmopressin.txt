==Medical uses==

===Bed wetting ===
Desmopressin is used to treat [[nocturnal enuresis]] (bedwetting). It is usually prescribed in the form of desmopressin acetate, by mouth. Children taking DDAVP have 2.2 fewer wet nights per week and are 4.5 times more likely to sleep without disruption compared with placebo.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=11711411|year=2001|last1=Evans|first1=JH|title=Evidence based management of nocturnal enuresis|volume=323|issue=7322|pages=1167–9|pmc=1121645|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7322.1167}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|pmc=2722621 |title=La prise en charge de l’énurésie nocturne primaire |journal=Paediatr Child Health |year=2005 |volume=10 |issue=10 |pages=616–620|pmid=19668677}}</ref>

===Nighttime urination===
Desmopressin has some benefit in adults who have problems with night time urination (known as nocturia).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ebell|first1=MH|last2=Radke|first2=T|last3=Gardner|first3=J|title=A systematic review of the efficacy and safety of desmopressin for nocturia in adults.|journal=The Journal of Urology|date=Sep 2014|volume=192|issue=3|pages=829–35|pmid=24704009|doi=10.1016/j.juro.2014.03.095}}</ref> The FDA approved this use for those who make excess urine in 2017.<ref name=FDA2017>{{cite web|last1=Commissioner|first1=Office of the|title=Press Announcements - FDA approves first treatment for frequent urination at night due to overproduction of urine|url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm544877.htm|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170306193439/https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm544877.htm|archivedate=2017-03-06|df=}}</ref>

===Clotting disorders===
Desmopressin (DDAVP) stimulates the release of von Willebrand factor (vWF) from the [[Weibel-Palade body|Weibel–Palade bodies]] of [[endothelial cell]]s, thereby increasing the levels of vWF (as well as coagulant factor VIII) 3 to 5-fold. 
Desmopressin can be used to promote the release of [[von Willebrand factor]] (with subsequent increase in [[factor VIII]] survival secondary to vWF complexing) in patients with [[coagulation]] disorders such as [[von Willebrand disease]], mild [[hemophilia A]] (factor VIII deficiency), and [[thrombocytopenia]]. It can be used with uremic induced platelet dysfunction. It is not effective in the treatment of hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency) or severe hemophilia A.

The usefulness of desmopressin in hemophilia A depends predominantly on whether the deficiency involved is qualitative (i.e., there is a functional mutation of the protein itself) or quantitative (i.e., there is decreased production of a functionally normal protein). Desmopressin is most effective in patients with quantitative deficiencies, because by increasing the release of vWF, the circulating pool of functional factor VIII effectively increases, as well. In patients who have functional defects in factor VIII, the use of desmopressin is moot, because it will only increase the circulating levels of a nonfunctional protein.

===Diabetes insipidus===
Desmopressin is used in the treatment of [[neurogenic diabetes insipidus|central diabetes insipidus]] (DI) as a replacement for endogenous [[antidiuretic hormone]] (ADH) that is in insufficient quantity due to decreased or non-existent secretion or production of ADH by the posterior pituitary or hypothalamus, respectively. It is also used in the [[diabetes insipidus#Diagnosis|diagnostic workup for diabetes insipidus]], in order to distinguish central from [[Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus|DI due to the kidneys]]. Desmopressin is not effective at treating nephrogenic DI, thus a positive effect is generally indicative of neurogenesis.

==Side effects==
* [[headache]]s
* [[Flushing (physiology)|facial flushing]]
* [[nausea]]
* [[hyponatremia]]<ref name=FDA2017/>
* [[seizures]]

US drug regulators added warning to the ''nasal sprays'' after two people died and fifty-nine other people had seizures. This occurred due to [[hyponatremia]], a deficit of the body's sodium levels, and the nasal spray is no longer approved for use in children in the United States.<ref>[http://www.webmd.com/news/20071204/2-deaths-spur-bedwetting-drug-warning 2 Deaths Spur sleep apnea Drug Warning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207224633/http://www.webmd.com/news/20071204/2-deaths-spur-bedwetting-drug-warning |date=2007-12-07 }}. Webmd.com (2007-12-04). Retrieved on 2011-04-18.</ref> However, US drug regulators have said that desmopressin tablets can still be considered safe for treatment of nocturnal enuresis in children as long as the person is otherwise healthy.

Patients must stop taking desmopressin if they develop severe vomiting and diarrhea, fever, the flu, or severe cold. Patients should also be very cautious about taking desmopressin during hot weather conditions or following strenuous exercise, as these conditions can place stress on the body's electrolyte and water balance.

A body needs to maintain a balance of water and ([[sodium]]).  If sodium levels become too low ([[hyponatremia]]) – either as a result of increased water take-up or reduced salt levels – a person may have [[seizures]] and, in extreme cases, may die.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/InfoSheets/HCP/desmopressinHCP.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213200539/http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/InfoSheets/HCP/desmopressinHCP.htm |date=December 13, 2007 }}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Desmopressin works by limiting the amount of water that is eliminated in the urine; that is, it is an [[antidiuretic]]. It works at the level of the [[nephron|renal collecting duct]] by binding to [[Arginine vasopressin receptor 2|V2 receptor]]s, which signal for the translocation of [[aquaporin|aquaporin channels]] via cytosolic vesicles to the apical membrane of the collecting duct. The presence of these aquaporin channels in the distal nephron causes increasing water reabsorption from the urine, which becomes passively re-distributed from the nephron to systemic circulation by way of basolateral membrane channels.<ref name="pmid24294289">{{cite journal |author=Friedman FM, Weiss JP |title=Desmopressin in the treatment of nocturia: clinical evidence and experience |journal=Ther Adv Urol |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=310–7 | date=December 2013 |pmid=24294289 |pmc=3825109 |doi=10.1177/1756287213502116 |url=}}</ref> Desmopressin also stimulates release of [[von Willebrand factor]] from [[endothelial cell]]s by acting on the V2 receptor.

Desmopressin is degraded more slowly than [[recombinant DNA|recombinant]] vasopressin, and requires less frequent administration. In addition, it has little effect on [[blood pressure]], while vasopressin may cause [[arterial hypertension]]. Vasopressin stimulates the release of ACTH, which indirectly increases responsiveness of alpha-1 receptor in blood vessel smooth muscle, increasing vessel tone and blood pressure.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} Several studies has shown that Desmopressin does not stimulate ACTH release (except in [[Cushing's Disease]]),<ref name=pmid12773117}>{{cite journal|last1=Pecori Giraldi|first1=F|last2=Marini|first2=E|last3=Torchiana|first3=E|last4=Mortini|first4=P|last5=Dubini|first5=A|last6=Cavagnini|first6=F|title=Corticotrophin-releasing activity of desmopressin in Cushing's disease: lack of correlation between in vivo and in vitro responsiveness.|journal=The Journal of endocrinology|date=June 2003|volume=177|issue=3|pages=373–9|pmid=12773117|doi=10.1677/joe.0.1770373}}</ref><ref name=pmid9274696>{{cite journal|last1=Colombo|first1=P|last2=Passini|first2=E|last3=Re|first3=T|last4=Faglia|first4=G|last5=Ambrosi|first5=B|title=Effect of desmopressin on ACTH and cortisol secretion in states of ACTH excess.|journal=Clinical endocrinology|date=June 1997|volume=46|issue=6|pages=661–8|pmid=9274696|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2265.1997.1330954.x}}</ref><ref name=pmid8911861>{{cite journal|last1=Foppiani|first1=L|last2=Sessarego|first2=P|last3=Valenti|first3=S|last4=Falivene|first4=MR|last5=Cuttica|first5=CM|last6=Giusti Disem|first6=M|title=Lack of effect of desmopressin on ACTH and cortisol responses to ovine corticotropin-releasing hormone in anorexia nervosa.|journal=European journal of clinical investigation|date=October 1996|volume=26|issue=10|pages=879–83|pmid=8911861|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2362.1996.tb02133.x}}</ref> and therefore does not directly raise blood pressure, however, one study showed that it stimulates ACTH release in over 50% of healthy subjects.<ref name=pmid10594528>{{cite journal|last1=Scott|first1=LV|last2=Medbak|first2=S|last3=Dinan|first3=TG|title=ACTH and cortisol release following intravenous desmopressin: a dose-response study.|journal=Clinical endocrinology|date=November 1999|volume=51|issue=5|pages=653–8|pmid=10594528|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2265.1999.00850.x}}</ref> Additionally, desmopressin is able to enhance ACTH and cortisol release in normal subjects following oCRH administration, but not in patients with [[anorexia nervosa]].<ref name=pmid8911861 />

==Chemistry==
Desmopressin (''1-desamino-8-<small>D</small>-arginine vasopressin'') is a man-made form of the normal human hormone [[vasopressin|arginine vasopressin]] (the antidiuretic hormone, or ADH), a peptide containing nine amino acids.

Compared to vasopressin, desmopressin's first amino acid has been [[deamination|deaminated]], and the [[arginine]] at the eighth position is in the ''dextro'' rather than the ''levo'' form (see [[stereochemistry]]).
