==Medical use==
In the United States, ado-trastuzumab emtansine was approved specifically for treatment of HER2-positive [[metastatic breast cancer]] (mBC) in patients who have been treated previously with trastuzumab and a [[taxane]] ([[paclitaxel]] or [[docetaxel]]), and who have already been treated for mBC or developed tumor [[wikt:recurrence|recurrence]] within six months of [[adjuvant therapy]].<ref name="PI">{{cite web|url= http://www.gene.com/download/pdf/kadcyla_prescribing.pdf |publisher= Genentech| |title=Full Prescribing Information for Kadcyla| access-date= 2012-02-23}}</ref>

Approval was based on the EMILIA study, a phase III [[clinical trial]] that compared trastuzumab emtansine versus [[capecitabine]] (Xeloda) plus [[lapatinib]] (Tykerb) in 991 people with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who had previously been treated with trastuzumab and taxane [[chemotherapy]]. This trial showed improved [[progression-free survival]] in patients treated with trastuzumab emtansine (median 9.6 vs. 6.4 months), along with improved [[overall survival]] (median 30.9 vs. 25.1 months) and safety.<ref name="NEJM-Verma">{{cite journal  |last1= Verma |first1= S| last2= Miles| first2= D| last3= Gianni |first3= L| collaboration= &nbsp;|title= Trastuzumab emtansine for HER2-positive advanced breast cancer |journal=N.

===Clinical trials===

Since 2013 there have been some more clinical trials:

* First line treatment for metastatic breast cancer: the MARIANNE study<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT01120184|A Study of Trastuzumab Emtansine (T-DM1) Plus Pertuzumab/Pertuzumab Placebo Versus Trastuzumab (Herceptin) Plus a Taxane in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer (MARIANNE)}}.

==Adverse effects==
During clinical trials, the most common [[adverse effect]]s of trastuzumab emtansine were fatigue, nausea, musculoskeletal pain, [[thrombocytopenia]] (low [[platelet]] counts), headache, [[elevated transaminases|increased liver enzyme levels]], and constipation.<ref name="PI"/>

Severe adverse events identified during the EMILIA trial included [[hepatotoxicity]] (liver damage), including rare cases of [[liver failure]], [[hepatic encephalopathy]], and [[nodular regenerative hyperplasia]]; heart damage (dysfunction of the [[left ventricle]]); [[interstitial lung disease]], including [[acute interstitial pneumonitis]]; thrombocytopenia; and [[peripheral neuropathy]].<ref name="PI"/> Overall, trastuzumab emtansine was better tolerated than the control treatment, a combination of [[lapatinib]] (Tykerb) and [[capecitabine]] (Xeloda), with 43% of patients in the trastuzumab emtansine group experiencing severe toxic effects, versus 59% of those who received lapatinib/capecitabine; furthermore, fewer patients had to stop treatment due to adverse effects than with lapatinib or capecitabine.<ref name="PI"/> [[Anemia]], low platelet counts, and peripheral neuropathy were more common among patients who received trastuzumab emtansine, whereas heart damage and gastrointestinal effects, such as vomiting, diarrhea, and [[stomatitis]], were more common with lapatinib/capecitabine.<ref name="PI"/>

In the United States, Kadcyla carries [[black box warning]]s for liver toxicity, heart damage (reduction in left ventricular [[ejection fraction]]), and [[developmental toxicity|fetal harm]] if given to pregnant women.<ref name="PI"/>

==UK pricing issues==
In the UK, Kadcyla was not recommended for use by the [[National Health Service]] by advisory body [[NICE]], reportedly because an acceptable pricing agreement could not be reached with [[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Triggle|first1=Nick|title=NHS says no to new breast cancer drug Kadcyla|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-28688311|publisher=BBC Health News|date=8 August 2014|accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref> Originally it cost £5,900 a month.<ref name=Gn2015>[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/04/breast-cancer-drug-kadcyla-to-remain-on-nhs-after-manufacturer-lowers-price Breast cancer drug Kadcyla to remain on NHS after manufacturer lowers price.

==Nomenclature==
In the United States, Kadcyla was approved with the generic name "ado-trastuzumab emtansine", rather than the original [[United States Adopted Name]] (USAN) issued in 2009, "trastuzumab emtansine". The "ado-" prefix was added at the request of the FDA to help prevent [[medication error|dispensing errors]].<ref>{{cite techreport |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2013/125427Orig1s000Sumr.pdf |title=Summary Review for Regulatory Action |vauthors=Kim TE, Pazdur R |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |page=8 |year=2013 |accessdate=2013-02-22}}</ref> During [[preclinical development]] and clinical trials, the drug was also known as trastuzumab-DM1 or trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 (after the codename for [[emtansine]]), both abbreviated T-DM1, and by the codename PRO132365.<ref name="NCI"/>
