'''Prednisone''' is a synthetic [[Glucocorticoid|corticosteroid]] drug that is particularly effective as an [[immunosuppressive drug|immunosuppressant drug]]. It is used to treat certain [[inflammation|inflammatory]] diseases (such as moderate [[allergy|allergic]] reactions), some [[autoimmune disease]]s, and (at higher doses) some types of [[cancer]], but it has significant [[adverse effect]]s.

== Medical uses ==
Prednisone is used for many different [[autoimmune disease]]s and inflammatory conditions, including: [[asthma]], [[COPD]], [[CIDP]], [[rheumatic disorders]], [[allergic]] disorders, [[ulcerative colitis]] and [[Crohn's disease]], [[adrenocortical insufficiency]], [[hypercalcemia]] due to cancer, [[thyroiditis]], [[laryngitis]], severe [[tuberculosis]], [[urticaria]] (hives), [[lipid pneumonitis]], [[pericarditis]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[nephrotic syndrome]], [[sarcoidosis]], to relieve the effects of [[shingles]], [[lupus]], [[myasthenia gravis]], [[poison oak]] exposure, [[Ménière's disease]],  [[autoimmune hepatitis]], the [[Herxheimer reaction]] that is common during the treatment of [[syphilis]], [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]], [[uveitis]], and as part of a drug regimen to prevent rejection after [[organ transplant]].<ref>{{EMedicine|article|172356|Autoimmune Hepatitis|treatment}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://livertox.nlm.nih.gov//Corticosteroids.htm|title=Corticosteroids|website=livertox.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2017-04-07}}</ref><ref name=AHFS>{{cite web|title=Prednisone|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/prednisone.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref>

Prednisone has also been used in the treatment of [[migraine]] headaches and [[cluster headache]]s and for severe [[aphthous ulcer]]. Prednisone is used as an [[antitumor drug]].<ref>[U.S.] National Library of Medicine, Medical Subject Headings. [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/mesh/2009/MB_cgi?mode=&term=Antineoplastic+Agents,+Hormonal Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal] (2009). Retrieved 9-11-2010</ref> It is important in the treatment of [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]], [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]]s, [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]], [[multiple myeloma]], and other hormone-sensitive tumors, in combination with other anticancer drugs.

Prednisone can be used in the treatment of decompensated [[heart failure]] to potentiate renal responsiveness to diuretics, especially in [[heart failure]] patients with refractory diuretic resistance with large dose of loop diuretics.<ref>{{cite journal|last=RIEMER|first=AD|title=Application of the newer corticosteroids to augment diuresis in congestive heart failure.|journal=The American journal of cardiology|date=April 1958|volume=1|issue=4|pages=488–96|pmid=13520608|doi=10.1016/0002-9149(58)90120-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=NEWMAN|first=DA|title=Reversal of intractable cardiac edema with prednisone.|journal=New York state journal of medicine|date=15 February 1959|volume=59|issue=4|pages=625–33|pmid=13632954}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|authors=Zhang, H; Liu, C; Ji, Z; Liu, G; Zhao, Q; Ao, YG; Wang, L; Deng, B; Zhen, Y; Tian, L; Ji, L; Liu, K|title=Prednisone adding to usual care treatment for refractory decompensated congestive heart failure.|journal=International heart journal|date=September 2008|volume=49|issue=5|pages=587–95|pmid=18971570|doi=10.1536/ihj.49.587}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=C|author2=Liu, G |author3=Zhou, C |author4=Ji, Z |author5=Zhen, Y |author6= Liu, K |title=Potent diuretic effects of prednisone in heart failure patients with refractory diuretic resistance.|journal=The Canadian journal of cardiology|date=September 2007|volume=23|issue=11|pages=865–8|pmid=17876376|pmc=2651362 |doi=10.1016/s0828-282x(07)70840-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|authors=Liu, C; Chen, H; Zhou, C; Ji, Z; Liu, G; Gao, Y; Tian, L; Yao, L; Zheng, Y; Zhao, Q; Liu, K|title=Potent potentiating diuretic effects of prednisone in congestive heart failure.|journal=Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology|date=October 2006|volume=48|issue=4|pages=173–6|pmid=17086096|doi=10.1097/01.fjc.0000245242.57088.5b}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Massari|first=F|author2=Mastropasqua, F |author3=Iacoviello, M |author4=Nuzzolese, V |author5=Torres, D |author6= Parrinello, G |title=The glucocorticoid in acute decompensated heart failure: Dr Jekyll or Mr Hyde?|journal=The American Journal of Emergency Medicine|date=March 2012|volume=30|issue=3|pages=517.e5–517.e10 |pmid=21406321|doi=10.1016/j.ajem.2011.01.023}}</ref> In terms of the mechanism of action for this purpose: prednisone, a [[glucocorticoid]], can improve renal responsiveness to atrial [[Natriuresis|natriuretic]] peptide by increasing the density of natriuretic peptide receptor type A in the renal inner medullary collecting duct, inducing a potent diuresis.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=C|author2=Chen, Y |author3=Kang, Y |author4=Ni, Z |author5=Xiu, H |author6=Guan, J |author7= Liu, K |title=Glucocorticoids improve renal responsiveness to [[atrial natriuretic peptide]] by up-regulating natriuretic peptide receptor-A expression in the renal inner medullary collecting duct in decompensated heart failure.|journal=The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics|date=October 2011|volume=339|issue=1|pages=203–9|pmid=21737535|doi=10.1124/jpet.111.184796}}</ref>

== Side effects ==
Short-term side effects, as with all glucocorticoids, include high blood [[glucose]] levels (especially in patients with [[diabetes mellitus]] or on other medications that increase blood glucose, such as [[tacrolimus]]) and [[mineralocorticoid]] effects such as fluid retention.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/steroids/art-20045692?pg=2|title=Prednisone and other corticosteroids: Balance the risks and benefits - Mayo Clinic|work=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en}}</ref> The mineralocorticoid effects of prednisone are minor, which is why it is not used in the management of adrenal insufficiency, unless a more potent mineralocorticoid is administered concomitantly.

It can also cause [[Depression (mood)|depression]] or depressive symptoms and [[anxiety]] in some individuals.<ref>[http://www.drugs.com/prednisone.html Prednisone Information from Drugs.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a601102.html#side-effects Prednisone: MedlinePlus Drug Information<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

=== Dependency ===
[[Adrenal gland|Adrenal]] suppression will begin to occur if prednisone is taken for longer than seven days.  Eventually, this may cause the body to temporarily lose the ability to manufacture natural corticosteroids (especially cortisol), which results in dependence on prednisone. For this reason, prednisone should not be abruptly stopped if taken for more than seven days; instead, the dosage should be gradually reduced. This weaning process may be over a few days, if the course of prednisone was short, but may take weeks or months {{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} if the patient had been on long-term treatment. Abrupt withdrawal may lead to an [[Addison's disease#Addisonian crisis|Addison crisis]]. For those on chronic therapy, alternate-day dosing may preserve adrenal function and thereby reduce side effects.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080711145809/http://www.uspharmacist.com/NewLook/CE/glucocort/lesson.htm |title=Therapeutic and Adverse Effects of Glucocorticoids |work=Bello CS, Garrett SD. U.S. Pharmacist Continuing Education Program no. 430-000-99-028-H01, August 1999}}</ref>

Glucocorticoids act to inhibit feedback of both the [[hypothalamus]], decreasing [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] [CRH], and [[corticotrophs]] in the [[anterior pituitary]] gland, decreasing the amount of [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] [ACTH]. For this reason, glucocorticoid analogue drugs such as prednisone down-regulate the natural synthesis of glucocorticoids.  This mechanism leads to dependence in a short time and can be dangerous if medications are withdrawn too quickly. The body must have time to begin synthesis of CRH and ACTH and for the adrenal glands to begin functioning normally again.

=== Withdrawal ===
The magnitude and speed of dose reduction in corticosteroid withdrawal should be determined on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the underlying condition being treated, and individual patient factors such as the likelihood of relapse and the duration of corticosteroid treatment. Gradual withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids should be considered in those whose disease is unlikely to relapse and have:

* received more than 40&nbsp;mg prednisone (or equivalent) daily for more than 1 week
* been given repeat doses in the evening;
* received more than 3 weeks' treatment
* recently received repeated courses (particularly if taken for longer than 3 weeks)
* taken a short course within 1 year of stopping long-term therapy
* other possible causes of adrenal suppression

Systemic corticosteroids may be stopped abruptly in those whose disease is unlikely to relapse and who have received treatment for 3 weeks or less and who are not included in the patient groups described above.

During corticosteroid withdrawal, the dose may be reduced rapidly down to physiological doses (equivalent to prednisolone 7.5&nbsp;mg daily) and then reduced more slowly. Assessment of the disease may be needed during withdrawal to ensure that relapse does not occur.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Iliopoulou|first=Amalia|last2=Abbas|first2=Afroze|last3=Murray|first3=Robert|date=2013-05-19|title=How to manage withdrawal of glucocorticoid therapy|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/psb.1060/abstract|journal=Prescriber|language=en|volume=24|issue=10|pages=23–29|doi=10.1002/psb.1060|issn=1931-2253}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==
Prednisone has no substantial biological effects until converted via hepatic metabolism to [[prednisolone]].<ref>[http://druginfo.nlm.nih.gov/drugportal/ProxyServlet?mergeData=true&objectHandle=DBMaint&APPLICATION_NAME=drugportal&actionHandle=default&nextPage=jsp/drugportal/ResultScreen.jsp&TXTSUPERLISTID=0000053032&QV1=PREDNISONE Medline drug information for prednisone]</ref>

==Industry==

The pharmaceutical industry uses prednisone tablets for the [[calibration]] of [[dissolution testing]] equipment according to the [[United States Pharmacopeia]] (USP).

==Chemistry==
Prednisone is a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]] [[pregnane]] [[corticosteroid]] and [[chemical derivative|derivative]] of [[cortisone]] and is also known as '''δ<sup>1</sup>-cortisone''' or '''1,2-dehydrocortisone''' or as '''17α,21-dihydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,11,20-trione'''.<ref name="Elks2014">{{cite book|author=J.

The first isolation and structure identifications of prednisone and prednisolone were done in 1950 by [[Arthur Nobile]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Wainwright|first=M|title=The secret of success: Arthur Nobile's discovery of the steroids prednisone and prednisolone in the 1950s revolutionised the treatment of arthritis|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/the-secret-of-success-arthur-nobiles-discovery-of-the-steroids-prednisone-and-prednisolone-in-the-1950s-revolutionised-the-treatment-of-arthritis/oclc/106716069&referer=brief_results|publisher=Chemistry in Britain|accessdate=15 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=National Inventors Hall of Fame|url=http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/355.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=New Jersey Inventors Hall of Fame|url=http://www.stevens.edu/njinvent/2000/inductees_2000/nobile.html}}</ref> The first commercially feasible synthesis of prednisone was carried out in 1955 in the laboratories of Schering Corporation, which later became [[Schering-Plough|Schering-Plough Corporation]], by Arthur Nobile and coworkers.<ref>Merck Index, 14th Edition, p.1327. Published by Merck & Co. Inc.</ref> They discovered that [[cortisone]] could be microbiologically oxidized to prednisone by the bacterium ''Corynebacterium simplex.''

The enhanced adrenocorticoid activity of these compounds over cortisone and hydrocortisone was demonstrated in mice.<ref>H.L. Herzog et al ''Science'', Vol. 121, p 176 (1955).</ref>

Prednisone and prednisolone were introduced in 1955 by Schering and Upjohn, under the brand names Meticorten and Delta-Cortef, respectively.<ref>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm Drugs@FDA: FDA Approved Drug Products<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> These prescription medicines are now available from a number of manufacturers as generic drugs.
