'''Novartis International AG''' is a Swiss [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[pharmaceutical company]] based in [[Basel]], Switzerland. It is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies by both market cap and sales.

Novartis manufactures the drugs [[clozapine]] (Clozaril), [[diclofenac]] (Voltaren), [[carbamazepine]] (Tegretol), [[valsartan]] (Diovan) and [[imatinib mesylate]] (Gleevec/Glivec). Additional agents include [[ciclosporin]] (Neoral/Sandimmun), [[letrozole]] (Femara), [[methylphenidate]] (Ritalin), [[terbinafine]] (Lamisil), and others.

In 1996, [[Ciba-Geigy]] merged with Sandoz; the pharmaceutical and agrochemical divisions of both companies formed Novartis as an independent entity. Other Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz businesses were sold, or, like [[Ciba Specialty Chemicals]], spun off as independent companies. The Sandoz brand disappeared for three years, but was revived in 2003 when Novartis consolidated its [[generic drug]]s businesses into a single subsidiary and named it Sandoz. Novartis divested its agrochemical and [[genetically modified crops]] business in 2000 with the spinout of [[Syngenta]] in partnership with [[AstraZeneca]], which also divested its agrochemical business.

Novartis is a full member of the [[European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations]] (EFPIA),<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.efpia.eu/content/default.asp?PageID=559&DocID=4883 |title=The Pharmaceutical Industry in Figures - 2008 Edition |publisher=European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) |format=PDF |page=49 |accessdate=2008-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080916100937/http://www.efpia.eu/content/default.asp?PageID=559&DocID=4883 |archivedate=16 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> the [[International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations]] (IFPMA),<ref>[http://www.ifpma.org/about-ifpma/members/companies.html IFPMA Member List] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207235721/http://www.ifpma.org/about-ifpma/members/companies.html |date=7 February 2014 }}</ref> and the [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]] (PhRMA).<ref>[http://www.phrma.org/about/member-companies PhRMA Member List] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006232747/http://www.phrma.org/about/member-companies |date=6 October 2013 }}</ref>

== History ==
Novartis was created in 1996 from the merger of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz Laboratories, both Swiss companies with long histories. Ciba-Geigy was formed in 1970 by the merger of J. R. Geigy Ltd (founded in Basel in 1758) and CIBA (founded in Basel in 1859). Combining the histories of the merger partners, the company's effective history spans 250 years.<ref name="novhist">{{Citation |title=Company history |work=corporate website |at=novartis.com |publisher=Novartis |url=http://www.novartis.com/about-novartis/company-history/index.shtml |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230203847/http://www.novartis.com/about-novartis/company-history/index.shtml |archivedate=30 December 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref>

===Ciba-Geigy ===
====Ciba====
In 1859, Alexander Clavel (1805–1873) took up the production of [[fuchsine]] in his factory for [[silk]]-dyeing works in Basel. In 1864, a new site for the production of synthetic dyes was constructed, and in 1873, Clavel sold his dye factory to the new company Bindschedler and Busch. In 1884, Bindschedler and Busch was transformed into a joint-stock company with the name "Gesellschaft für Chemische Industrie Basel" (Company for Chemical Industry Basel). The [[acronym]], CIBA, was adopted as the company's name in 1945.

====Geigy====
Johann Rudolf Geigy-Gemuseus (1733–1793) began trading in 1758 in "materials, chemicals, dyes and drugs of all kinds"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ciba.com/index/cmp-index/cmp-about/cmp-abo-history.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103182548/http://ciba.com/index/cmp-index/cmp-about/cmp-abo-history.htm |archivedate=2010-01-03 |title=Archive of Ciba, now a part of BASF: History |publisher=Ciba.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-27}}</ref><ref name="MinRec">Staff, The Mineralogical Record Biographical Archive.

Johann Rudolf Geigy-Merian (1830–1917) and Johann Muller-Pack acquired a site in Basel in 1857, where they built a [[dyewood]] mill and a [[dye]] extraction plant. Two years later, they began the production of synthetic [[fuchsine]]. In 1901, they formed the [[public limited company]] Geigy and the name of the company was changed to J. R. Geigy Ltd in 1914. In 1925, J. R. Geigy Ltd. began producing textile auxiliaries,<ref>"Textile auxiliaries" are in the class of [[specialty chemicals]] and "enable a processing operation in preparation, dyeing, printing, or finishing to be carried out more effectively or which is essential if a given effect is to be obtained.

In 1939, Geigy chemist [[Paul Hermann Müller]] discovered that [[DDT]] was effective against malaria-bearing insects. He received the 1948 [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]] for this work.

====Ciba‑Geigy Ltd====
CIBA and Geigy merged in 1971 to form Ciba‑Geigy Ltd. {{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|iː|b|ə|_|ˈ|g|aɪ|g|i|}}.

===Sandoz===
{{Redirect|Sandoz}}
Before the 1996 merger with Ciba-Geigy to form Novartis, Sandoz Pharmaceuticals (Sandoz AG) was a [[pharmaceutical]] company headquartered in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]] (as was Ciba-Geigy), and was best known for developing drugs such as [[Sandimmune]] for [[organ transplantation]], the [[antipsychotic]] [[Clozaril]], [[Mellaril]] Tablets and [[Serentil]] Tablets for treating [[psychiatric disorders]], and [[Cafergot]] Tablets and [[Torecan]] Suppositories for treating [[migraine headaches]].

The ''Chemiefirma Kern und Sandoz'' ("Kern and Sandoz Chemistry Firm") was founded in 1886 by [[Alfred Kern]] (1850–1893) and Edouard Sandoz (1853–1928). The first dyes manufactured by them were [[alizarin]]blue and [[auramine]]. After Kern's death, the partnership became the corporation ''Chemische Fabrik vormals Sandoz'' in 1895. The company began producing the fever-reducing drug [[antipyrin]] in the same year. In 1899, the company began producing the sugar substitute [[saccharin]]. Further pharmaceutical research began in 1917 under [[Arthur Stoll]] (1887–1971), who is the founder of Sandoz's pharmaceutical department in 1917.<ref>{{cite web|author=Monday - Friday,8:30 - 17:00, GMT+1(Central European Time) |url=http://www.novartis.com/about-novartis/company-history/index.shtml |title=Company history |publisher=Novartis.com |date=2010-12-15 |accessdate=2012-01-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230203847/http://www.novartis.com/about-novartis/company-history/index.shtml |archivedate=30 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref> In 1918, Arthur Stoll isolated [[ergotamine]] from [[ergot]]; the substance was eventually used to treat migraine and headaches and was introduced under the trade name Gynergen in 1921.

Between the World Wars, Gynergen (1921) and Calcium-Sandoz (1929) were brought to market. Sandoz also produced chemicals for textiles, paper, and [[leather]], beginning in 1929. In 1939, the company began producing agricultural chemicals.

The [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] effects of [[lysergic acid diethylamide]] (LSD) were discovered at the Sandoz laboratories in 1943 by [[Arthur Stoll]] and [[Albert Hofmann]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/obituaries/albert-hofmann-102-invented-lsd/75591/ |title=Albert Hofmann, 102, Invented LSD - The New York Sun |publisher=Nysun.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-23| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131020203430/http://www.nysun.com/obituaries/albert-hofmann-102-invented-lsd/75591/ | archivedate = 2013-10-20| deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US2438259|title=Patent US2438259 - D-lysergic acid diethyl amide|work=google.com}}</ref> Sandoz began clinical trials and marketed the substance, from 1947 through the mid-1960s, under the name ''Delysid'' as a [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] drug, thought useful for treating a wide variety of [[Mental disorder|mental ailments]], ranging from [[alcoholism]] to [[sexual deviancy]]. Sandoz suggested in its marketing literature that psychiatrists take LSD themselves,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flashback.se/archive/my_problem_child/chapter4.html#2 |title=Albert Hofmann: LSD - My Problem Child: Use of LSD in Psychiatry |publisher=Flashback.se |date= |accessdate=2012-01-16| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060707201805/http://www.flashback.se/archive/my_problem_child/chapter4.html | archivedate = 2006-07-07| deadurl=yes}}</ref> to gain a better subjective understanding of the [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] experience, and many did exactly that and so did other scientific researchers. The Sandoz product received mass publicity as early as 1954, in a [[Time Magazine]] feature.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,860898,00.html | work=Time | title=Medicine: Dream Stuff | date=28 June 1954 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827000524/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C860898%2C00.html | archivedate=27 August 2013 | deadurl=no | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Research on LSD peaked in the 1950s and early 1960s. Sandoz withdrew the drug from the market in the mid-1960s. The drug became a cultural novelty of the 1960s after psychologist [[Timothy Leary]] at [[Harvard University]] began to promote its use for recreational and spiritual experiences among the general public.

Sandoz opened its first foreign offices in 1964. In 1967, Sandoz merged with [[Wander AG]] (known for [[Ovomaltine]] and [[Isostar]]). Sandoz acquired the companies [[Delmark]], [[Wasabröd]] (a [[Sweden|Swedish]] manufacturer of [[crisp bread]]), and [[Gerber Products Company]] (a [[baby food]] company). On 1 November 1986, a fire broke out in a production plant storage room, which led to [[Sandoz chemical spill]] and a large amount of [[pesticide]] being released into the upper [[Rhine]] river. This exposure killed many fish and other aquatic life. In 1995, Sandoz spun off its [[specialty chemicals]] business to form [[Clariant]]. In 1997, Clariant merged with the specialty chemicals business that was spun off from [[Hoechst AG]] in [[Germany]].<ref>Anna Bálint: ''Clariant clareant.

==Basel headquarters campus redesign==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Novartis building - 83d40m - basel - frank-gehry p2z.JPG|thumb|[[Human resources]] building of the new Basel campus of Novartis—designed by [[Frank Gehry]]]] -->

An ongoing Basel Campus Project has the aim to transform Novartis headquarters in Basel "from an industrial complex to a place of innovation, knowledge, and encounter".<ref name="novartis1">{{cite web

In 1999, [[Peter Walker (landscape architect)|PWP Landscape Architecture]] won the competition for a landscape master plan that would transform a 51-acre site beside the Rhine River from a paved industrial landscape crisscrossed with train tracks into a modern—and largely pedestrian—research and administrative campus filled with outdoor art, trees, greens, and parks. The plan also dealt with an extensive network of existing underground infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwpla.com/projects/norvatis-st-johann-campus-landscape-master-plan/&details|title=Novartis Headquarters, Landscape Master Plan - PWP Landscape Architecture|author=Brooklyn Digital Foundry|work=pwpla.com}}</ref>

The buildings were gradually demolished and replaced with works by architects and artists of international stature. [[Frank Gehry]], [[Rafael Moneo]], and from [[SANAA]], [[Kazuyo Sejima]] and [[Ryue Nishizawa]] were among the architects and [[Jenny Holzer]] and [[Richard Serra]] among the artists. Marked diversity of forms now dominates the campus. Novel features and technologies were introduced by Gehry to conform to the building standards of the Swiss government that prohibit [[air-conditioning]], while still selecting a contemporary style of massive use of glass exteriors. One adaptation by the architect includes the integration of a building vent, [[teepee]]-style, through the roof, which creates a chimney effect that draws cool air in at the lower levels and vents warmer air.

== Controversies and criticism ==

=== Challenge to India's patent laws ===
{{Main|Novartis v. Union of India & Others}}

Novartis fought a seven-year, controversial battle to patent [[Imatinib|Gleevec]] in India, and took the case all the way to the [[Indian Supreme Court]], where the patent application was finally rejected. The patent application at the center of the case was filed by Novartis in India in 1998, after India had agreed to enter the [[World Trade Organization]] and to abide by worldwide intellectual property standards under the [[TRIPS]] agreement. As part of this agreement, India made changes to its patent law; the biggest of which was that prior to these changes, patents on products were not allowed, while afterwards they were, albeit with restrictions. These changes came into effect in 2005, so Novartis' patent application waited in a "mailbox" with others until then, under procedures that India instituted to manage the transition. India also passed certain amendments to its patent law in 2005, just before the laws came into effect, which played a key role in the rejection of the patent application.<ref name=NYTimesIndiaDecision/>

The patent application<ref>Note: The Indian patent application No.1602/MAS/1998 does not appear to be publicly available.

When examination of Novartis' patent application began in 2005, it came under immediate attack from [[Opposition proceeding|oppositions]] initiated by generic companies that were already selling Gleevec in India and by advocacy groups. The application was rejected by the patent office and by an appeal board. The key basis for the rejection was the part of Indian patent law that was created by amendment in 2005, describing the patentability of new uses for known drugs and modifications of known drugs. That section, Paragraph 3d, specified that such inventions are patentable only if "they differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy."<ref name="SpicyIP1">Shamnad Basheer for Spicy IP 11 March 2006 [http://spicyip.com/2006/03/first-mailbox-opposition-gleevec.html First Mailbox Opposition (Gleevec) Decided in India] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021162820/http://spicyip.com/2006/03/first-mailbox-opposition-gleevec.html |date=21 October 2013 }}</ref><ref name="Appellate">[https://www.scribd.com/doc/133340456/IPAB-Order-Dated-26-Jun-2009-in-Novartis-v-Union-of-India Intellectual Property Appellate Board decision dated 26 June 2009, p 149] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022185309/http://www.scribd.com/doc/133340456/IPAB-Order-Dated-26-Jun-2009-in-Novartis-v-Union-of-India |date=22 October 2013 }}</ref> At one point, Novartis went to court to try to invalidate Paragraph 3d; it argued that the provision was unconstitutionally vague and that it violated TRIPS.

The Supreme Court case hinged on the interpretation of Paragraph 3d. The Supreme Court decided that the substance that Novartis sought to patent was indeed a modification of a known drug (the raw form of imatinib, which was publicly disclosed in the 1993 patent application and in scientific articles), that Novartis did not present evidence of a difference in therapeutic efficacy between the final form of Gleevec and the raw form of imatinib, and that therefore the patent application was properly rejected by the patent office and lower courts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Supreme Court rejects bid by Novartis to patent Glivec|url=http://spicyipindia.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/supreme-court-rejects-bid-by-novartis.html| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131217091420/http://spicyipindia.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/supreme-court-rejects-bid-by-novartis.html | archivedate = 2013-12-17| deadurl=no}}</ref>

In reaction to the decision, Ranjit Shahani, vice-chairman and managing director of Novartis India Ltd was quoted as saying "This ruling is a setback for patients that will hinder medical progress for diseases without effective treatment options."<ref>[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130402/jsp/business/story_16736700.jsp#.UV3-TcV49_M Shift in Novartis Strategy, The Telegraph] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511194923/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130402/jsp/business/story_16736700.jsp#.UV3-TcV49_M |date=11 May 2013 }}</ref> He also said that companies like Novartis would invest less money in research in India as a result of the ruling.<ref name=NYTimesIndiaDecision/> Novartis also emphasized that it continues to be committed to access to its drugs; according to Novartis, by 2013, "95% of patients in India—roughly 16,000 people—receive Glivec free of charge... and it has provided more than $1.7&nbsp;billion worth of Glivec to Indian patients in its support program since it was started...."<ref name=WSJ />

=== Sexual discrimination suit ===
On 17 May 2010, a jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York awarded $3,367,250 in [[compensatory damages]] against Novartis, finding that the company had committed [[sexual discrimination]] against twelve female [[sales representative]]s and entry-level [[Management|managers]] since 2002, in matters of pay, promotion, and treatment after learning that the employees were [[pregnancy|pregnant]].

=== Marketing violations ===

In September 2008, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) sent a notice to Novartis Pharmaceuticals regarding its advertising of [[Focalin]] XR, an [[ADHD]] drug, in which the company overstated its efficacy while marketing to the public and medical professionals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2008/ucm1048118.htm |title=Focalin XR (dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride) extended-release capsules CII |date=2008-09-25 |work=Warning Letters |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) |accessdate=2009-08-05 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68JlJjSGb?url=http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2008/ucm1048118.htm |archivedate=10 June 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}</ref>

In 2005, federal prosecutors opened an investigation into Novartis' marketing of several drugs: [[Trileptal]], an antiseizure drug; three drugs for heart conditions - [[Diovan]] (the company’s top-selling product), [[Exforge]], and [[Tekturna]]; [[Sandostatin]], a drug to treat a growth hormone disorder; and [[Zelnorm]], a drug for irritable bowel syndrome.<ref name=NYTtrileptal/> In September, 2010, Novartis agreed to pay US$422.5&nbsp;million in criminal and civil claims and to enter into a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the US Office of the Inspector General.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.novartis.com/newsroom/media-releases/en/2010/1448151.shtml

"So it’s not surprising that they would settle because they don’t have a legal leg to stand on."

=== Fighting off-label prescribing ===
Outside the US, Novartis markets the drug [[ranibizumab]] (trade name Lucentis), which is a [[monoclonal antibody]] fragment derived from the same parent mouse antibody as [[bevacizumab]] (Avastin). Both Avastin and Lucentis were created by [[Genentech]] which is owned by Roche; Roche markets Avastin worldwide, and also markets Lucentis in the US. Lucentis has been approved worldwide as a treatment for wet [[macular degeneration]] and other retinal disorders; Avastin is used to treat certain cancers. Because the price of Lucentis is much higher than Avastin, many ophthalmologists began having [[compounding pharmacies]] formulate Avastin for administration to the eye, and began treating their patients with Avastin.<ref>Andrew Pollack for ''The New York Times''. 28 April 2011 [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/business/29eye.html?_r=0 Cheaper Drug to Treat Eye Disease Is Effective]</ref> In 2011, four trusts of the [[National Health Service]] in the UK issued policies approving use and payment for administering Avastin for macular degeneration, in order to save money, even though Avastin had not been approved for that indication.<ref name="BBClucentis">{{cite news|last=Jeffreys |first=Branwen |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-17956425 |title=Using Avastin for eye condition wet AMD 'could save NHS £84m' |publisher=bbc.com |date=2012-05-06 |accessdate=2012-05-06| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131106060449/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-17956425 | archivedate = 2013-11-06| deadurl=no}}</ref> In April 2012, after failing to persuade the trusts that it was uncertain whether Avastin was as safe and effective as Lucentis, and in order to retain the market for Lucentis, Novartis announced it would sue the trusts.<ref name=BBClucentis/><ref name="copleyreuters2012">{{Citation|last=Copley |first=Caroline |first2=Ben |last2=Hirschler |editor=Potter, Mark |publication-date=24 April 2012 |title=Novartis challenges UK Avastin use in eye disease |publisher=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/24/us-novartis-britain-idUSBRE83N0GM20120424 |accessdate=2012-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522203804/https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/24/us-novartis-britain-idUSBRE83N0GM20120424 |archivedate=22 May 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref> However, in July Novartis offered significant discounts (kept confidential) to the trusts, and the trusts agreed to change their policy,<ref>Ben Adams for Pharmafile. 26 July 2012 [http://www.pharmafile.com/news/173606/lucentis-price-cut-ends-pct-novartis-dispute Lucentis price cut ends PCT-Novartis dispute] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019124934/http://www.pharmafile.com/news/173606/lucentis-price-cut-ends-pct-novartis-dispute |date=19 October 2013 }}</ref> and in November, Novartis dropped the litigation.<ref>Ben Adams for Pharma Times. 3 October 2012.
