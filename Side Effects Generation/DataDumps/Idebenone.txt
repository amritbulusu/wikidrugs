'''Idebenone''' (pronounced eye-'''deb'''-eh-known, trade names '''Catena''', '''Raxone''', '''Sovrima''', among others) is a [[pharmaceutical drug|drug]] that was initially developed by [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company]] for the treatment of [[Alzheimer's disease]] and other [[cognitive]] defects.<ref name="CHMP">{{cite journal|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Public_assessment_report/human/000908/WC500070576.pdf|publisher=[[European Medicines Agency]]|title=CHMP Assessment Report for Sovrima|date=20 November 2008|pages=6, 9–11, 67f}}</ref> This has been met with limited success. The Swiss company [[Santhera Pharmaceuticals]] has started to investigate it for the treatment of [[neuromuscular diseases]]. In 2010, early [[clinical trial]]s for the treatment of [[Friedreich's ataxia]]<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00229632|Idebenone to Treat Friedreich's Ataxia}}</ref> and [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]]<ref name="Duchenne">{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00654784|Efficacy and Tolerability of Idebenone in Boys With Cardiac Dysfunction Associated With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DELPHI)}}</ref> have been completed. {{as of|2013|12}} the drug is not approved for these indications in North America or Europe, but it is approved for the treatment of [[Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy]] (LHON) in Europe.

Chemically, idebenone is an [[organic compound]] of the [[quinone]] family. It is also promoted commercially as a [[Organic compound#Synthetic compounds|synthetic]] [[Structural analog|analog]] of [[Coenzyme Q|coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub>]] (CoQ<sub>10</sub>).

In some European countries, the drug is available for the treatment of individual patients in special cases.<ref name="CHMP" />

====Friedreich's ataxia (Sovrima)====
Preliminary testing has been done in humans and found idebenone to be a safe treatment for Friedreich's ataxia (FA), exhibiting a positive effect on [[cardiac hypertrophy]] and neurological function.<ref name="pmid17826341">{{cite journal |vauthors=Di Prospero NA, Baker A, Jeffries N, Fischbeck KH |title=Neurological effects of high-dose idebenone in patients with Friedreich's ataxia: a randomised, placebo-controlled trial |journal=Lancet Neurol |volume=6 |issue=10 |pages=878–86 |date=October 2007 |pmid=17826341 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(07)70220-X |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1474-4422(07)70220-X}}</ref> The latter was only significantly improved in young patients.<ref name="pmid18710357">{{cite journal |vauthors=Tonon C, Lodi R |title=Idebenone in Friedreich's ataxia |journal=Expert Opin Pharmacother |volume=9 |issue=13 |pages=2327–37 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18710357 |doi=10.1517/14656566.9.13.2327 }}</ref> In a different experiment, a one-year test on eight patients, idebenone reduced the rate of deterioration of cardiac function, but without halting the progression of [[ataxia]].<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Buyse G, Mertens L, Di Salvo G, etal |title=Idebenone treatment in Friedreich's ataxia: neurological, cardiac, and biochemical monitoring |journal=Neurology |volume=60 |issue=10 |pages=1679–81 |date=May 2003 |pmid=12771265 |doi= 10.1212/01.wnl.0000068549.52812.0f|url=http://www.neurology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12771265}}</ref>

The drug was approved for FA in Canada in 2008 under conditions including proof of efficacy in further clinical trials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/prodpharma/notices-avis/conditions/catena_fs_fd_117672-eng.php |title=Heath Canada Fact Sheet - Catena|archiveurl=https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20140619110910/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/prodpharma/notices-avis/conditions/catena_fs_fd_117672-eng.php|archivedate=19 June 2014}}</ref> However, on February 27, 2013, Health Canada announced that idebenone would be voluntarily recalled as of April 30, 2013 by its Canadian manufacturer, Santhera Pharmaceuticals, due to the failure of the drug to show efficacy in the further clinical trials that were conducted.<ref>[http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/hc-sc/2013/23509a-eng.php Voluntary Withdrawal of Catena from the Canadian Market]</ref> In 2008, the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) refused a marketing authorisation for this indication.<ref name="CHMP" /> As of 2013 the drug was not approved for FA in Europe<ref>Margaret Wahl for Quest Magazine, MAY 28, 2010.

====Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (Raxone)====
[[Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy]] (LHON) is a mitochondrially inherited (mother to all offspring) degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons that leads to an acute or subacute loss of central vision; this affects predominantly young adult males.  Santhera completed a Phase III clinical trial in this indication in Europe with positive results,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Klopstock | first1 = T | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2011 | title = A randomized placebo-controlled trial of idebenone in Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy | journal = Brain | volume = 134 | issue = 9| pages = 2677–86 | pmid = 21788663 | doi=10.1093/brain/awr170 | pmc=3170530}}</ref> and submitted an application to market the drug to European regulators in July 2011.<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff|website= European Biotechnology News|date=26 July 2011|url=http://www.eurobiotechnews.eu/news/messages-archive/archive/article/santhera-publishes-pivotal-trial-results-of-idebenone-and-goes-for-eu-approval.html|title= Santhera publishes pivotal trial results of idebenone and goes for EU approval|archiveurl=https://archive.is/5TT2F|archivedate=17 Feb 2013}}</ref> In January 2013, the request for marketing authorisation was refused by the EMA.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Summary_of_opinion_-_Initial_authorisation/human/002425/WC500137469.pdf|publisher=[[European Medicines Agency]]|title=Refusal of the marketing authorisation for Raxone (idebenone)|date=17 January 2013}}</ref>

====Other neuromuscular diseases====
Phase I and II clinical trials for the treatment of [[MELAS]] (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes)<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00887562|Study of Idebenone in the Treatment of Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis & Stroke-like Episodes (MELAS)}}</ref> and [[primary progressive multiple sclerosis]]<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00950248|Double Blind Placebo-Controlled Phase I/II Clinical Trial of Idebenone in Patients With Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (IPPoMS)}}</ref> are ongoing {{as of|2013|12|lc=on}}.

===Life style===
Idebenone is claimed to have properties similar to CoQ<sub>10</sub> in its [[antioxidant]] properties, and has therefore been used in [[anti-aging]] on the basis of [[free-radical theory]]. Clinical evidence for this use is missing. It has been used in [[topical]] applications to treat [[wrinkle]]s.<ref name="pmid17129261">{{cite journal |vauthors=McDaniel D, Neudecker B, Dinardo J, Lewis J, Maibach H |title=Clinical efficacy assessment in photodamaged skin of 0.5% and 1.0% idebenone |journal=J Cosmet Dermatol |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=167–73 |date=September 2005 |pmid=17129261 |doi=10.1111/j.1473-2165.2005.00305.x |url=}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==
In cellular and tissue models, idebenone acts as a transporter in the [[electron transport chain]] of [[mitochondria]] and thus increases the production of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) which is the main energy source for cells, and also inhibits [[lipoperoxide]] formation. Positive effects on the energy household of mitochondria has also been observed in animal models.<ref name="CHMP" /><ref name="pmid3410376">{{cite journal |vauthors=Suno M, Nagaoka A |title=[Effect of idebenone and various nootropic drugs on lipid peroxidation in rat brain homogenate in the presence of succinate] |language=Japanese |journal=Nippon Yakurigaku Zasshi |volume=91 |issue=5 |pages=295–9 |date=May 1988 |pmid=3410376 |doi= 10.1254/fpj.91.295|url=}}</ref> Clinical relevance of these findings has not been established.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Idebenone is well absorbed from the gut but undergoes excessive [[first pass]] metabolism in the liver, so that less than 1% reach the circulation. This rate can be improved with special formulations ([[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]]s) of idebenone and by administering it together with fat food; but even taking these measures [[bioavailability]] still seems to be considerably less than 14% in humans. More than 99% of the circulating drug are bound to [[plasma protein]]s. Idebenone metabolites include [[glucuronide]]s and [[sulfate]]s, which are mainly (~80%) excreted via the urine.<ref name="CHMP" />
