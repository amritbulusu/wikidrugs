==Function==
IFNγ, or type II interferon, is a cytokine that is critical for [[innate immunity|innate]] and [[adaptive immunity]] against viral, some bacterial and protozoal infections. IFNγ is an important activator of macrophages and inducer of Class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule expression. Aberrant IFNγ expression is associated with a number of autoinflammatory and [[autoimmune]] diseases. The importance of IFNγ in the immune system stems in part from its ability to inhibit viral replication directly, and most importantly from its immunostimulatory and immunomodulatory effects. IFNγ is produced predominantly by natural killer ([[natural killer cell|NK]]) and natural killer T ([[Natural Killer T cell|NKT]]) cells as part of the innate immune response, and by [[CD4]] Th1 and [[CD8]] cytotoxic T lymphocyte ([[Cytotoxic T cell|CTL]]) effector T cells once [[antigen]]-specific immunity develops.<ref name="entrez2">{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: INFG | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=3458 | accessdate = }}</ref><ref name="pmid17981204">{{cite journal |vauthors=Schoenborn JR, Wilson CB | title = Regulation of interferon-gamma during innate and adaptive immune responses | journal = Adv.

{{see also|Interferon-gamma receptor}}Cellular responses to IFNγ are activated through its interaction with a heterodimeric receptor consisting of [[Interferon gamma receptor 1]] (IFNGR1) and [[Interferon gamma receptor 2]] (IFNGR2). IFNγ binding to the receptor activates the [[JAK-STAT pathway]]. IFNγ also binds to the [[glycosaminoglycan]] [[heparan sulfate]] (HS) at the cell surface. However, in contrast to many other heparan sulfate binding proteins, where binding promotes biological activity, the binding of IFNγ to HS inhibits its biological activity.<ref name="pmid9556569">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sadir R, Forest E, Lortat-Jacob H | title = The heparan sulfate binding sequence of interferon-gamma increased the on rate of the interferon-gamma-interferon-gamma receptor complex formation | journal = J.

The structural models shown in figures 1-3 for IFNγ<ref name="PDB_1FG9"/> are all shortened at their C-termini by 17 amino acids.

== Biological activity ==

IFNγ is secreted by [[T helper cell]]s (specifically, T<sub>h</sub>1 cells), [[cytotoxic T cell]]s (T<sub>C</sub> cells), macrophages, mucosal epithelial cells and [[NK cells]]. IFNγ is the only Type II [[interferon]] and it is [[Serology|serologically]] distinct from Type I interferons; it is acid-labile, while the type I variants are acid-stable.

IFNγ has antiviral, immunoregulatory, and anti-tumor properties.<ref name="pmid14525967">{{cite journal |vauthors=Schroder K, Hertzog PJ, Ravasi T, Hume DA | title = Interferon-gamma: an overview of signals, mechanisms and functions | journal = J. Leukoc.

Among the effects are:

* Promotes [[NK cell]] activity
* Increase antigen presentation and [[lysosome]] activity of [[macrophage]]s.
* Activate inducible [[nitric oxide synthase]] (iNOS)
* Induces the production of [[IgG2]]a and [[IgG3]] from activated plasma [[B cell]]s
* Cause normal cells to increase expression of [[class I MHC]] molecules as well as [[class II MHC]] on antigen-presenting cells&mdash;to be specific, through induction of [[antigen processing]] genes, including subunits of the [[immunoproteasome]] (MECL1, LMP2, LMP7), as well as [[Transporter associated with antigen processing|TAP]] and [[ARTS-1|ERAAP]] in addition possibly to the direct upregulation of MHC heavy chains and B2-microglobulin itself
* Promotes adhesion and binding required for [[leukocyte]] migration
* Induces the expression of intrinsic defense factors&mdash;for example, with respect to [[retrovirus]]es, relevant genes include [[TRIM5alpha]], [[APOBEC]], and [[Tetherin]], representing directly antiviral effects

IFNγ is the primary [[cytokine]] that defines T<sub>h</sub>1 cells: T<sub>h</sub>1 cells secrete IFNγ, which in turn causes more undifferentiated CD4<sup>+</sup> cells (Th0 cells) to differentiate into T<sub>h</sub>1 cells{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}, representing a [[positive feedback loop]]&mdash;while suppressing T<sub>h</sub>2 cell differentiation. (Equivalent defining cytokines for other cells include [[Interleukin 4|IL-4]] for T<sub>h</sub>2 cells and [[Interleukin 17|IL-17]] for [[T helper 17 cell|Th17 cells]].)

[[NK cell]]s and [[CD8+ cytotoxic T cell]]s also produce IFNγ. IFNγ suppresses [[osteoclast]] formation by rapidly degrading the [[RANK]] adaptor protein [[TRAF6]] in the [[RANK]]-[[RANKL]] signaling pathway, which otherwise stimulates the production of [[NF-κB]].

===Activity in granuloma formation===
A [[granuloma]] is the body's way of dealing with a substance it cannot remove or sterilize. Infectious causes of granulomas (infections are typically the most common cause of granulomas) include [[tuberculosis]], [[leprosy]], [[histoplasmosis]], [[cryptococcosis]], [[coccidioidomycosis]], [[blastomycosis]], and [[cat scratch disease]]. Examples of non-infectious granulomatous diseases are [[sarcoidosis]], [[Crohn's disease]], [[berylliosis]], [[giant-cell arteritis]], [[granulomatosis with polyangiitis]], [[eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis]], pulmonary [[rheumatoid nodule]]s, and aspiration of food and other particulate material into the lung. The infectious pathophysiology of granulomas is discussed primarily here.

The key association between IFNγ and granulomas is that IFNγ activates macrophages so that they become more powerful in killing intracellular organisms. Activation of macrophages by IFNγ from T<sub>h</sub>1 helper cells in [[mycobacteria]]l infections allows the macrophages to overcome the inhibition of [[phagolysosome]] maturation caused by mycobacteria (to stay alive inside macrophages).<ref>Citations needed</ref> The first steps in IFNγ-induced granuloma formation are activation of T<sub>h</sub>1 helper cells by macrophages releasing [[interleukin 1|IL-1]] and [[interleukin 12|IL-12]] in the presence of intracellular pathogens, and presentation of antigens from those pathogens. Next the T<sub>h</sub>1 helper cells aggregate around the macrophages and release IFNγ, which activates the macrophages. Further activation of macrophages causes a cycle of further killing of intracellular bacteria, and further presentation of antigens to T<sub>h</sub>1 helper cells with further release of IFNγ. Finally, macrophages surround the T<sub>h</sub>1 helper cells and become fibroblast-like cells walling off the infection.

===Activity during pregnancy ===
Uterine Natural Killer cells ([[natural killer cell|NK]]) secrete high levels of [[chemoattractant]]s, such as IFNγ. IFNγ dilates and thins the walls of maternal spiral arteries to enhance blood flow to the implantation site. This remodeling aids in the development of the placenta as it invades the uterus in its quest for nutrients. IFNγ knockout mice fail to initiate normal pregnancy-induced modification of [[decidual]] arteries. These models display abnormally low amounts of cells or [[necrosis]] of decidua.<ref name="pmid10899912">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ashkar AA, Di Santo JP, Croy BA | title = Interferon gamma contributes to initiation of uterine vascular modification, decidual integrity, and uterine natural killer cell maturation during normal murine pregnancy | journal = J.

== Production ==
Recombinant human interferon gamma, as an expensive biopharmaceutical, has been expressed in different expression systems including prokaryotic, protozoan, fungal (yeasts), plant, insect and mammalian cells. Human interferon gamma is commonly expressed in ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', marketed as ACTIMMUNE®, however, the resulting product of the prokaryotic expression system is not glycosylated with a short half-life in the bloodstream after injection; the purification process from bacterial expression system is also very costly. Other expression systems like ''[[Pichia pastoris]]'' did not show satisfactory results in terms of yields. <ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Razaghi A, Owens L, Heimann K, | title = Review of the recombinant human interferon gamma as an immunotherapeutic: Impacts of production platforms and glycosylation. | journal = Journal of Biotechnology | volume = 240 | pages = 48-60 | year = 2016 | doi = 10.1016/j.jbiotec.2016.10.022 }}</ref> <ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Razaghi A, Owens L, Heimann K, | title = Is ''Pichia pastoris'' a realistic platform for industrial production of recombinant human interferon gamma?. | journal = Biologicals | year = 2016 | doi = 10.1016/j.biologicals.2016.09.015 }}</ref>

It was not approved to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In 2002, the manufacturer InterMune issued a press release saying that phase III data demonstrated survival benefit in IPF and reduced mortality by 70% in patients with mild to moderate disease.
