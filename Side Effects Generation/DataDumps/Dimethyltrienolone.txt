==Pharmacology==
Dimethyltrienolone is an extremely potent [[agonist]] of the [[androgen receptor|androgen]] and [[progesterone receptor]]s and hence AAS and [[progestogen]].<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /> In [[animal study|animal]] [[bioassay]]s, it was shown to possess more than 100&nbsp;times the [[anabolic]] and [[androgen]]ic [[potency (pharmacology)|potency]] of the reference AAS [[methyltestosterone]].<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /> The drug is not a [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] for [[5α-reductase]] or [[aromatase]] and so is not potentiated in so-called "androgenic" [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s like the [[prostate gland]] or [[skin]] and does not have any [[estrogen]]ic activity.<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /> Due to its lack of estrogenicity, dimethyltrienolone has no propensity for causing estrogenic [[side effect]]s like [[gynecomastia]].<ref name="Llewellyn2009" /> Because of its C17α [[methyl group]] and very high resistance to [[liver|hepatic]] [[metabolism]], dimethyltrienolone is said to be exceedingly [[hepatotoxic]].<ref name="Llewellyn2009" />
