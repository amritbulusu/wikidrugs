Clomifene is useful in those who are infertile due to [[anovulation]] or [[oligoovulation]].<ref name="Committee2013"/> Evidence is lacking for the use of clomifene in those who are infertile without a known reason.<ref name=Hugh2010>{{cite journal|last=Hughes|first=E|author2=Brown, J |author3=Collins, JJ |author4= Vanderkerchove, P |title=Clomiphene citrate for unexplained subfertility in women.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=Jan 20, 2010|issue=1|pages=CD000057|pmid=20091498 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000057.pub2}}</ref> In such cases, studies have observed a clinical pregnancy rate 5.6% per cycle with clomifene treatment vs. 1.3%–4.2% per cycle without treatment.<ref name=Committee2013/>

Proper timing of the drug is important; it should be taken starting on about the fifth day of the cycle, and there should be frequent [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]].<ref name=FDAlabel>{{cite web|title=Clomiphene citrate tablets label|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/016131s026lbl.pdf|publisher=FDA|accessdate=September 11, 2016|location=Revised October 2012}}</ref><ref name=eMC>{{cite web|title=Clomifene 50mg Tablets - Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) - (eMC)|url=https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/13033|publisher=UK Electronic Medicines Compendium|accessdate=September 11, 2016|location=Last updated July 2007}}</ref><ref name=Committee2013/>

The following procedures may be used to monitor induced cycles:<ref name=Committee2013>{{cite journal |title=Use of clomiphene citrate in infertile women: a committee opinion |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=341–8 |date=August 2013  |pmid=23809505 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.05.033 |url=}}</ref>
*Follicular monitoring with [[vaginal ultrasound]], starting 4–6 days after last pill. Serial transvaginal ultrasound can reveal the size and number of developing follicles. It can also provide presumptive evidence of ovulation such as sudden collapse of the preovulatory follicle, and an increase in fluid volume in the [[rectouterine pouch]]. After ovulation, it may reveal signs of [[luteinization]] such as loss of clearly defined follicular margins and appearance of internal echoes.
*Serum [[estradiol]] levels, starting 4–6 days after last pill
*Post-coital test 1–3 days before ovulation to check whether there are at least 5 progressive sperm per [[High power field|HPF]] 
*Adequacy of LH surge by urine [[LH surge]] tests 3 to 4 days after last clomifene pill
*Mid-luteal progesterone, with at least 10&nbsp;ng/ml 7–9 days after ovulation being regarded as adequate.

Repeat dosing: This 5-day treatment course can be repeated every 30 days. The dosage may be increased by 50-mg increments in subsequent cycles until ovulation is achieved.<ref name=Committee2013/> It is not recommended by the manufacturer to use clomifene for more than 6 cycles.<ref name=FDAlabel/><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Trabert | first1 = B. | last2 = Lamb | first2 = E.

It is no longer recommended to perform an ultrasound examination to exclude any significant residual ovarian enlargement before each new treatment cycle.<ref name=Committee2013/>

Clomifene is sometimes used in the treatment of male [[hypogonadism]] as an alternative to [[testosterone replacement therapy]].<ref name="BachNajari2016">{{cite journal|last1=Bach|first1=Phil Vu|last2=Najari|first2=Bobby B.|last3=Kashanian|first3=James A.|title=Adjunct Management of Male Hypogonadism|journal=Current Sexual Health Reports|year=2016|issn=1548-3584|doi=10.1007/s11930-016-0089-7}}</ref> It has been found to increase testosterone levels by 2- to 2.5-fold in hypogonadal men.<ref name="BachNajari2016" />

==Adverse events==
The most common [[adverse drug reaction]] associated with the use of clomifene (>10% of people) is reversible ovarian enlargement.<ref name=FDAlabel/>

Less common effects (1-10% of people) include visual symptoms (blurred vision, [[diplopia|double vision]], floaters, [[photophobia|eye sensitivity to light]], [[scotomata]]), headaches, vasomotor flushes (or [[hot flash]]es), light sensitivity and pupil constriction, abnormal uterine bleeding and/or abdominal discomfort.<ref name=FDAlabel/>

Rare adverse events (<1% of people) include: [[hypertriglyceridemia|high blood level of triglycerides]], [[hepatitis|liver inflammation]], reversible [[alopecia|baldness]] and/or [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome]].<ref name=FDAlabel/>

Clomifene can lead to multiple ovulation, hence increasing the chance of [[twin]]s (10% of births instead of ~1% in the general population) and [[Multiple birth|triplets]].

Some studies have suggested that clomifene citrate if used for more than a year may increase the risk of [[ovarian cancer]].<ref name=Hugh2010/> This may only be the case in those who have never been and do not become pregnant.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Trabert|first=B|author2=Lamb, EJ |author3=Scoccia, B |author4=Moghissi, KS |author5=Westhoff, CL |author6=Niwa, S |author7= Brinton, LA |title=Ovulation-inducing drugs and ovarian cancer risk: results from an extended follow-up of a large United States infertility cohort.|journal=Fertility and Sterility|date=Dec 2013|volume=100|issue=6|pages=1660–6|pmid=24011610 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.08.008}}</ref> Subsequent studies have failed to corroborate
those findings.<ref name="Committee2013"/> This however is disputed and some feel there is no significant increase in risk.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gadducci|first=A|author2=Guerrieri, ME |author3=Genazzani, AR |title=Fertility drug use and risk of ovarian tumors: a debated clinical challenge.|journal=Gynecological Endocrinology|date=Jan 2013|volume=29|issue=1|pages=30–5|pmid=22946709|doi=10.3109/09513590.2012.705382}}</ref>

The [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of fetal and neonatal abnormalities for patients on clomifene for fertility is similar to that seen in the general population. There is no data to suggest a higher rate of congenital anomalies or spontaneous abortions after using this drug.<ref name=FDAlabel/>

==Pharmacology==
Clomifene is a [[nonsteroidal]] SERM that inhibits [[estrogen receptor]]s in the [[hypothalamus]], inhibiting [[negative feedback]] of estrogen on [[gonadotropin]] release, leading to up-regulation of the [[hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis]].<ref name=drugbank>[http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00882 DrugBank > Clomifene]. Updated on April 19, 2011</ref> Zuclomifene, a more active isomer, stays bound for longer periods of time.

In normal physiologic female hormonal cycling, at 7 days past ovulation, high levels of [[estrogen]] and [[progesterone]] produced from the corpus luteum inhibit [[GnRH]], [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]] and [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]] at the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary. If fertilization does not occur in the post-ovulation period the [[corpus luteum]] disintegrates due to a lack of beta-[[Human chorionic gonadotropin|hCG]]. This would normally be produced by the embryo in the effort of maintaining progesterone and estrogen levels during pregnancy.

Therapeutically, clomifene is given early in the menstrual cycle. It is typically prescribed beginning on day 3 and continuing for 5 days. By that time, FSH level is rising steadily, causing development of a few follicles. Follicles in turn produce the estrogen, which circulates in serum. In the presence of clomifene, the body perceives a low level of estrogen, similar to day 22 in the previous cycle. Since estrogen can no longer effectively exert negative feedback on the hypothalamus, GnRH secretion becomes more rapidly pulsatile, which results in increased pituitary gonadotropin (FSH, LH) release. (It should be noted that more rapid, lower amplitude pulses of GnRH lead to increased LH/FSH secretion, while more irregular, larger amplitude pulses of GnRH leads to a decrease in the ratio of LH/FSH.) Increased FSH level causes growth of more ovarian follicles, and subsequently rupture of follicles resulting in [[ovulation]]. Ovulation occurs most often 6–7 days after a course of clomifene.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Clomifene produces N-desmethylclomifene, [[clomifenoxide]] (clomifene N-oxide), and 4-hydroxyclomifene as [[metabolite]]s.<ref name="AcademicPress1998">{{cite book|title=Analytical Profiles of Drug Substances and Excipients|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kia7bq8EM9IC&pg=PA113|date=20 March 1998|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-086120-3|pages=113–}}</ref>

==Chemistry==
Clomifene is a [[triphenylethylene]] derivative. It is a mixture of two [[geometric isomerism|geometric isomers]], [[enclomifene]] (''(E)''-clomifene) and [[zuclomifene]] (''(Z)''-clomifene). These two isomers have been found to contribute to the mixed estrogenic and antiestrogenic properties of clomifene.<ref name=Hist/>

==History==
A team at [[William S. Merrell Chemical Company]] led by Frank Palopoli synthesized clomifene in 1956; after its biological activity was confirmed a patent was filed and issued in November 1959.<ref name=Hist/><ref>Allen, R.E., Palopoli, F.P., Schumann, E.L. and Van Campen, M.G. Jr. (1959) [https://www.google.com/patents/US2914563 U.S. Patent No. 2,914,563], Nov. 24, 1959.</ref>  Scientists at Merrell had previously synthesized [[chlorotrianisene]] and [[ethamoxytriphetol]].<ref name=Hist/>

Clinical studies were conducted under an [[Investigational New Drug]] Application; it was third drug for which an IND had been filed under the 1962 [[Kefauver Harris Amendment]] to the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] that had been passed in response to the [[thalidomide]] tragedy.<ref name=Hist/>  It was approved for marketing in 1967 under the brand name Clomid.<ref name=Hist/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Holtkamp DE, Greslin JG, Root CA, Lerner LJ |title=Gonadotrophin inhibiting and anti-fecundity effects of chloramiphene |journal=Proc.
