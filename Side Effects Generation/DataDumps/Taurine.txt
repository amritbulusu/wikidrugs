'''Taurine''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɔː|r|iː|n}}), or '''2-aminoethanesulfonic acid''', is an [[organic compound]] that is widely distributed in animal tissues.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Schuller-Levis | first1 = Georgia B. | last2 = Park | first2 = Eunkyue | year = 2003 | title = Taurine: new implications for an old amino acid | url = | journal = FEMS Microbiology Letters | volume = 226 | issue = | pages = 195–202 | doi = 10.1016/S0378-1097(03)00611-6 }}</ref>  It is a major constituent of [[bile]] and can be found in the [[large intestine]], and accounts for up to 0.1% of total human body weight. Taurine has many fundamental biological roles, such as conjugation of [[bile acid]]s, [[Antioxidant|antioxidation]], [[osmoregulation]], [[Membrane stabilizing effect|membrane stabilization]], and modulation of [[calcium signaling]]. It is essential for [[Circulatory system|cardiovascular]] function, and development and function of [[skeletal muscle]], the [[retina]], and the [[central nervous system]]. Taurine is unusual among biological molecules in being a [[sulfonic acid]], while the vast majority of biologically occurring acids contain the more weakly acidic [[carboxyl group]].  While taurine is sometimes called an amino acid, and indeed is an [[acid]] containing an [[amino]] group, it is not an [[amino acid]] in the usual biochemical meaning of the term, which refers to compounds containing both an [[amino]] and a [[carboxyl]] group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/amino-acid|title=the definition of amino acid|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2017-02-22}}</ref>

Taurine is named after the [[Latin]] ''taurus'' (a [[cognate]] of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ταῦρος) which means [[bull]] or [[ox]], as it was first isolated from ox bile in 1827 by German scientists [[Friedrich Tiedemann]] and [[Leopold Gmelin]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Einige neue Bestandtheile der Galle des Ochsen|author=F. Tiedemann, L. Gmelin|journal=Annalen der Physik|volume=85|issue=2|pages=326–37|year=1827|url=|doi=10.1002/andp.18270850214|bibcode = 1827AnP....85..326T |last2=Gmelin}}</ref>

==Synthesis and biosynthesis==

===Synthesis===
Synthetic taurine is obtained by the [[ammonolysis]] of [[isethionic acid]] (2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid), which in turn is obtained from the reaction of [[ethylene oxide]] with aqueous [[sodium bisulfite]]. A direct approach involves the reaction of [[aziridine]] with [[sulfurous acid]].<ref>{{cite book|editor=Kosswig K|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|chapter=Sulfonic Acids, Aliphatic|publisher=Wiley-VCH|location=|year=2000|doi=10.1002/14356007.a25_503}}</ref>

In 1993, about 5,000–6,000&nbsp;tons of taurine were produced for commercial purposes: 50% for pet food and 50% in pharmaceutical applications.<ref name=kirk>{{cite book|editor=Tully PS|title=Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology|chapter=Sulfonic Acids|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc|location=|year=2000|doi=10.1002/0471238961.1921120620211212.a01}}</ref> As of 2010, China alone has more than 40 manufacturers of taurine. Most of these enterprises employ the [[ethanolamine]] method to produce a total annual production of about 3,000&nbsp;tons.<ref name=Xia2010>{{cite web|author=Amanda Xia|title=China Taurine Market Is Expected To Recover|work=Press release and article directory: technology|date=2010-01-03|url=http://uberarticles.com/miscellaneous/china-taurine-market-is-expected-to-recover/|accessdate=2010-05-24}}</ref>

In the laboratory taurine can be produced by alkylation of ammonia with bromoethanesulfonate salts.<ref>C. S. Marvel, C. F. Bailey, and Frank Cortese "Taurine" Org. Synth. 1938, volume 18, 77.{{DOI|10.15227/orgsyn.018.0077}}</ref>

===Biosynthesis===
Taurine is derived from [[cysteine]]. Mammalian taurine synthesis occurs in the pancreas via the [[cysteine sulfinic acid]] pathway. In this pathway,  [[cysteine]] is first oxidized to its sulfinic acid, catalyzed by the enzyme [[cysteine dioxygenase]]. Cysteine sulfinic acid, in turn, is decarboxylated by [[sulfinoalanine decarboxylase]] to form [[hypotaurine]]. Hypotaurine is enzymatically oxidized to yield taurine by [[hypotaurine dehydrogenase]].<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Sumizu K | date = 1962 | title = Oxidation of hypotaurine in rat liver | journal = Biochim. Biophys. Acta | volume = 63 | pages = 210–212 | doi = 10.1016/0006-3002(62)90357-8 | pmid=13979247}}</ref>

Taurine is also produced by the [[transsulfuration pathway]], which converts [[homocysteine]] into [[cystathionine]]. The cystathionine is then  converted to [[hypotaurine]] by the sequential action of three enzymes: [[cystathionine gamma-lyase]], [[cysteine dioxygenase]], and cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase. Hypotaurine is then oxidized to taurine as described above.<ref>{{ Cite journal | author = Harris Ripps, Wen Shen |date = 2012 | title = Review: Taurine: A "very essential" amino acid | journal = Molecular Vision |volume = 18 | pages = 2673–2686 | pmid=23170060 | pmc=3501277}}</ref>

In another study, taurine intake was estimated to be generally less than 200&nbsp;mg/day, even in individuals eating a high-meat diet. According to another study, taurine consumption was estimated to vary between 40 and 400&nbsp;mg/day.

In cells, taurine keeps potassium and magnesium inside the cell, while keeping excessive sodium out. In this sense, it works like a diuretic.

==Safety and toxicity==
Taurine is involved in a number of crucial physiological processes. However, its role in these processes is not clearly understood and the influence of high taurine doses on these processes is uncertain. A substantial increase in the plasma concentration of growth hormone was reported in some epileptic patients during taurine tolerance testing (oral dose of 50&nbsp;mg per kg body mass per day), suggesting a potential to stimulate the hypothalamus and to modify neuroendocrine function.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://archneur.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=577988|title=Effects of Taurine on Seizures and Growth Hormone Release in Epileptic Patients|author1=John Mantovani, MD|author2=Darryl C.

==In animal nutrition==
Taurine is an essential dietary requirement for feline health, since house [[cat]]s (and all members of the [[Felidae|cat family]]) cannot synthesize the compound.

Research suggests taurine is essential to the normal development of [[passerine]] birds. Many passerines seek out taurine-rich [[spider]]s to feed their young, particularly just after hatching. Researchers compared the behaviors and development of birds fed a taurine-supplemented diet to a control diet and found the juveniles fed taurine-rich diets as neonates were much larger risk takers and more adept at spatial learning tasks.<ref name=Arnold2007>{{cite journal|author=Arnold|first=KE|author2=Ramsay, S.L.|author3=Donaldson, C.|author4=Adam, A|title=Parental prey selection affects risk-taking behaviour and spatial learning in avian offspring|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B|volume=274|issue=1625|pages=2563–9|year=2007|pmid=17698490|url=http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/index/M820008244125737.pdf|pmc=2275882|doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.0687}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

== Prematurely born infants deficiency risk ==
Prematurely born infants are believed to lack the enzymes needed to convert [[cystathionine]] to [[cysteine]], and may, therefore, become deficient in taurine. Taurine is present in [[breast milk]], and has been added to many infant formulas, as a measure of prudence, since the early 1980s. However, this practice has never been rigorously studied, and as such it has yet to be proven to be necessary, or even beneficial.<ref>Heird W.C. "Taurine in neonatal nutrition—revisited," ''[[Archives of Disease in Childhood|Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal Neonatal]]''. 2004 November; 89(6): F473-F474.  {{doi|10.1136/adc.2004.055095}}</ref>
