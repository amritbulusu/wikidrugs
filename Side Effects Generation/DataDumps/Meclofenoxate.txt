==Side effects==
Meclofenoxate is considered to be very safe and high in [[tolerability]].<ref name="Haavisto2008" /> However, possible side effects may include, rarely, [[insomnia]], [[dizziness]], [[Psychomotor agitation|restlessness]], [[muscle tremor]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[nausea]], [[muscle tension]], and [[headache]]; these side effects may be due to [[overdose|overdosage]] and may indicate the need for the dosage to be reduced.<ref name="Haavisto2008" />

==Research==
Meclofenoxate, as well as DMAE, have been found to increase the [[life expectancy|lifespans]] of mice by 30–50%, and thus may be [[Life extension#Anti-aging drugs|anti-aging drug]]s/[[anti-aging supplements|supplement]]s.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Science of Anti-aging Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RI8ZyNo5KCkC&pg=PA66|date=1 January 2003|publisher=American Academy of Anti-Aging Med|isbn=978-0-9668937-3-1|pages=66–}}</ref>
