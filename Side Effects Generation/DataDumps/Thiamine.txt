==Chemistry==

Thiamine is a colorless [[organosulfur compound]] with a [[chemical formula]] [[Carbon|C]]<sub>12</sub>[[Hydrogen|H]]<sub>17</sub>[[Nitrogen|N]]<sub>4</sub>[[Oxygen|O]][[Sulfur|S]]. Its structure consists of an [[pyrimidine|aminopyrimidine]] and a [[thiazole]] ring linked by a [[methylene bridge]].  The thiazole is substituted with methyl and hydroxyethyl side chains.  Thiamine is [[Solubility|soluble]] in [[water]], [[methanol]], and [[glycerol]] and practically insoluble in less polar [[organic solvent]]s. It is stable at acidic pH, but is unstable in alkaline solutions.<ref name="Mahan"/><ref name="Tanphaichitr">Tanphaichitr V. Thiamin. In: Shils ME, Olsen JA, Shike M et al., editors.

The biosynthetic pathways may differ among organisms. In [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]] and other [[enterobacteriaceae]], ThMP may be phosphorylated to the [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] ThDP by a thiamine-phosphate kinase (ThMP + ATP → ThDP + ADP, EC 2.7.4.16). In most bacteria and in eukaryotes, ThMP is hydrolyzed to thiamine, which may then be pyrophosphorylated to ThDP by thiamine diphosphokinase (thiamine + ATP → ThDP + AMP, EC 2.7.6.2).

The biosynthetic pathways are regulated by [[riboswitch]]es. If there is sufficient thiamine present in the cell then the thiamine binds to the [[mRNA]]s for the enzymes that are required in the pathway and prevents their [[translation (biology)|translation]]. If there is no thiamine present then there is no inhibition, and the enzymes required for the biosynthesis are produced. The specific riboswitch, the [[TPP riboswitch]], is the only riboswitch identified in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bocobza | first1 = Samuel | last2 = Aharoni | first2 = Asaph | year = 2008 | title = Switching the light on plant riboswitches | url = | journal = Trends in Plant Science | pmid = 18778966 | volume = 13 | issue = 10| pages = 526–533 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2008.07.004 }}</ref>

==Nutrition==

===Occurrence in foods===
Thiamin is found in a wide variety of processed and whole foods, with edible seeds, [[legume]]s, [[rice]] and [[fortified food|processed foods]], such as [[breakfast cereal]]s, having among the highest contents.<ref name="usda">{{cite web|url=https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/nutrients/report/nutrientsfrm?max=25&offset=0&totCount=0&nutrient1=404&nutrient2=&nutrient3=&subset=1&fg=13&fg=20&fg=1&fg=15&fg=9&fg=16&fg=12&fg=10&fg=5&sort=c&measureby=g|title=Thiamin content per 100 grams; select food subset, abridged list by food groups|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, USDA Branded Food Products Database v.3.6.4.1|date=17 January 2017|accessdate=27 January 2017}}</ref><ref name="lpi">{{cite web|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/vitamins/thiamin#food-sources|title=Thiamin, Food sources|publisher=Micronutrient Information Center, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR|date=2013|accessdate=27 January 2017}}</ref> Some other foods naturally rich in thiamin are [[cornmeal|cornflour]], pork, and [[spinach]].<ref name=usda/>

The salt thiamin mononitrate, rather than thiamin hydrochloride, is used for food fortification, as the mononitrate is more stable, and does not absorb water from natural humidity (is non-hygroscopic), whereas thiamin hydrochloride is hygroscopic.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} When thiamin mononitrate dissolves in water, it releases nitrate (about 19% of its weight) and is thereafter absorbed as the thiamin cation.

===Dietary recommendations===
The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for thiamine in 1998. The current EARs for thiamine for women and men ages 14 and up are 0.9 mg/day and 1.0 mg/day, respectively; the RDAs are 1.1 and 1.2 mg/day, respectively. RDAs are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements. RDA for pregnancy is 1.4 mg/day. RDA for lactation is also 1.4 mg/day. For infants up to 12 months the Adequate Intake (AI) is 0.2 to 0.3 mg/day. For children ages 1–13 years the RDA increases with age from 0.5 to 0.9 mg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient.  In the case of thiamine there is no UL, as there is no human data for adverse effects from high doses. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs).<ref name="DRItext">{{cite book | last1 = [[Institute of Medicine]] | title = Dietary Reference Intakes for Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin, and Choline | chapter = Thiamin | publisher = The National Academies Press | year = 1998 | location = Washington, DC | pages = 58-86 | url = http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6015&page=58 | accessdate = 2017-08-29 | isbn = 0-309-06554-2}}</ref>  

The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined the same as in United States. For women (including those pregnant or lactating), men and children the PRI is 0.1 mg thiamine per megajoule (MJ) of energy consumed. As the conversion is 1 MJ = 238.8 kcal, an adult consuming 2388 calories should be consuming 1.0 mg thiamine. This is slightly lower than the U.S. RDA.<ref>{{cite web | title = Overview on Dietary Reference Values for the EU population as derived by the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies| year = 2017| url = https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf}}</ref> The EFSA reviewed the same safety question and also reached the conclusion that there was not sufficient evidence to set a UL for thiamine.<ref>{{citation| title = Tolerable Upper Intake Levels For Vitamins And Minerals| publisher = European Food Safety Authority| year = 2006| url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf}}</ref> 

For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For thiamine labeling purposes 100% of the Daily Value was 1.5&nbsp;mg, but as of May 27, 2016 it was revised to 1.2&nbsp;mg to bring it into agreement with the RDA.<ref name="FedReg">{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-27/pdf/2016-11867.pdf |title=Federal Register May 27, 2016 Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels. FR page 33982.}}</ref> A table of the old and new adult Daily Values is provided at [[Reference Daily Intake]]. Food and supplement companies have until July 28, 2018 to comply with the change.

===Antagonists===
Thiamine in foods can be degraded in a variety of ways. [[Sulfite]]s, which are added to foods usually as a preservative,<ref>McGuire, M. and K.A. Beerman. Nutritional Sciences: From Fundamentals to Foods. 2007. California: Thomas Wadsworth.</ref> will attack thiamine at the methylene bridge in the structure, cleaving the pyrimidine ring from the thiazole ring.<ref name="Combs"/>  The rate of this reaction is increased under acidic conditions. Thiamine is degraded by thermolabile [[thiaminase]]s (present in raw fish and shellfish<ref name="Mahan"/>). Some thiaminases are produced by bacteria. Bacterial thiaminases are cell surface enzymes that must dissociate from the membrane before being activated; the dissociation can occur in ruminants under acidotic conditions. Rumen bacteria also reduce sulfate to sulfite, therefore high dietary intakes of sulfate can have thiamine-antagonistic activities.

Plant thiamine antagonists are heat-stable and occur as both the ortho- and para-hydroxyphenols. Some examples of these antagonists are [[caffeic acid]], [[chlorogenic acid]], and [[tannic acid]]. These compounds interact with the thiamine to oxidize the thiazole ring, thus rendering it unable to be absorbed. Two flavonoids, [[quercetin]] and [[rutin]], have also been implicated as thiamine antagonists.<ref name="Combs"/>

==Absorption and transport==

===Absorption===

Thiamine is released by the action of phosphatase and pyrophosphatase in the upper small intestine.  At low concentrations, the process is carrier-mediated. At higher concentrations absorption also occurs via passive diffusion. Active transport is greatest in the jejunum and ileum, but it can be inhibited by alcohol consumption or by folic deficiency.<ref name="Mahan"/> Decline in thiamine absorption occurs at intakes above 5&nbsp;mg/day.<ref>Hayes KC, [[D. Mark Hegsted|Hegsted DM]]. Toxicity of the Vitamins. In: National Research Council (U.S.). Food Protection Committee. Toxicants Occurring Naturally in Foods. 2nd ed. Washington DCL: National Academy Press; 1973.</ref> The cells of the intestinal mucosa have thiamine pyrophosphokinase activity, but it is unclear as to whether the enzyme is linked to active absorption. The majority of thiamine present in the intestine is in the pyrophosphorylated form ThDP, but when thiamine arrives on the serosal side of the intestine it is often in the free form. The uptake of thiamine by the mucosal cell is likely coupled in some way to its phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. On the serosal side of the intestine, evidence has shown that discharge of the vitamin by those cells is dependent on Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent ATPase.<ref name="Combs"/>

===Bound to serum proteins===
The majority of thiamine in [[blood serum|serum]] is bound to proteins, mainly [[albumin]].  Approximately 90% of total thiamine in blood is in [[erythrocyte]]s. A specific binding protein called thiamine-binding protein (TBP) has been identified in rat serum and is believed to be a hormone-regulated carrier protein important for tissue distribution of thiamine.<ref name="Combs"/>

===Cellular uptake===
Uptake of thiamine by cells of the blood and other tissues occurs via active transport and passive diffusion.<ref name="Mahan"/> About 80% of intracellular thiamine is phosphorylated and most is bound to proteins. In some tissues, thiamine uptake and secretion appears to be mediated by a soluble thiamine transporter that is dependent on Na<sup>+</sup> and a transcellular proton gradient.<ref name="Combs"/>

===Tissue distribution===
Human storage of thiamine is about 25 to 30&nbsp;mg, with the greatest concentrations in skeletal muscle, heart, brain, liver, and kidneys. ThMP and free (unphosphorylated) thiamine is present in plasma, milk, cerebrospinal fluid, and, it is presumed, all extracellular fluids.  Unlike the highly phosphorylated forms of thiamine, ThMP and free thiamine are capable of crossing cell membranes.  Thiamine contents in human tissues are less than those of other species.<ref name="Combs"/><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1046/j.1471-4159.1996.66010250.x|author1=Bettendorff L. |author2=Mastrogiacomo F. |author3=Kish S. J. |author4=Grisar T. |title=Thiamine, thiamine phosphates and their metabolizing enzymes in  human brain|journal= J. Neurochem. |year=1996 |volume= 66 |pages=250–258|pmid=8522961|issue=1}}</ref>

===Excretion===
Thiamine and its acid metabolites (2-methyl-4-amino-5-pyrimidine carboxylic acid, 4-methyl-thiazole-5-acetic acid, and thiamine acetic acid) are excreted principally in the urine.<ref name="Tanphaichitr"/>

==Function==
Its [[phosphate]] derivatives are involved in many cellular processes. The best-characterized form is [[thiamine pyrophosphate]] (TPP), a [[coenzyme]] in the [[catabolism]] of sugars and amino acids. In yeast, TPP is also required in the first step of [[alcoholic fermentation]]. All organisms use thiamine, but it is made only in bacteria, fungi, and plants. Animals must obtain it from their diet, and thus, for humans, it is an [[essential nutrient]]. Insufficient intake in birds produces a characteristic [[polyneuritis]].

Thiamine is usually considered as the transport form of the vitamin. There are five known natural thiamine phosphate derivatives: [[thiamine monophosphate]] (ThMP), [[thiamine diphosphate]] (ThDP), also sometimes called [[thiamine pyrophosphate]] (TPP), [[thiamine triphosphate]] (ThTP), and the recently discovered [[adenosine thiamine triphosphate]] (AThTP), and  [[adenosine thiamine diphosphate]] (AThDP). While the coenzyme role of thiamine diphosphate is well-known and extensively characterized,  the non-coenzyme action of thiamine and derivatives may be realized through binding to a number of recently identified proteins which do not use the catalytic action of thiamine diphosphate <ref name="nature.com">[http://www.nature.com/srep/2015/150727/srep12583/full/srep12583.html Molecular mechanisms of the non-coenzyme action of thiamin in brain: biochemical, structural and pathway analysis : Scientific Reports<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Thiamine diphosphate===
No physiological role is known for ThMP; however, the diphosphate is physiologically relevant.  The synthesis of [[thiamine diphosphate]] (ThDP), also known as ''thiamine pyrophosphate'' (TPP) or ''cocarboxylase'', is catalyzed by an enzyme called [[thiamine diphosphokinase]]  according to the reaction thiamine + ATP → ThDP + AMP (EC 2.7.6.2). ThDP is a [[coenzyme]] for several enzymes that catalyze the transfer of two-carbon units and in particular the [[dehydrogenation]] ([[decarboxylation]] and subsequent conjugation with [[coenzyme A]]) of 2-oxoacids (alpha-keto acids).  Examples include:

* Present in most species
** [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]] and 2[[oxoglutarate dehydrogenase]] (also called [[alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase|α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase]])
** [[branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase]]
** [[2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA lyase]]
** [[transketolase]]
* Present in some species:
** [[pyruvate decarboxylase]] (in [[yeast]])
** several additional [[bacteria]]l enzymes

The enzymes [[transketolase]], [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]] (PDH), and 2-[[oxoglutarate dehydrogenase]] (OGDH) are all important in [[carbohydrate metabolism]]. The cytosolic enzyme transketolase is a key player in the [[pentose phosphate pathway]], a major route for the biosynthesis of the pentose [[sugar]]s [[deoxyribose]] and [[ribose]]. The mitochondrial PDH and OGDH are part of biochemical pathways that result in the generation of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), which is a major form of energy for the cell. PDH links glycolysis to the citric acid cycle, while the reaction catalyzed by OGDH is a rate-limiting step in the [[citric acid cycle]]. In the nervous system, PDH is also involved in the production of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter, and for myelin synthesis.<ref>Butterworth RF. Thiamin.

=== Thiamine triphosphate ===
[[Thiamine triphosphate]] (ThTP) was long considered a specific neuroactive form of thiamine.  However, recently it was shown that ThTP exists in [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s suggesting a much more general cellular role.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Makarchikov AF, Lakaye B, Gulyai IE, Czerniecki J, Coumans B, Wins P, Grisar T, Bettendorff L |year=2003|title=Thiamine triphosphate and thiamine triphosphatase activities: from bacteria to mammals|journal=Cell.

==History==
Thiamine was the first of the water-soluble vitamins to be described,<ref name="Mahan"/> leading to the discovery of more such trace compounds essential for survival and to the notion of [[vitamin]].

In 1884, [[Kanehiro Takaki]] (1849–1920), a surgeon general in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese navy]], rejected the previous germ theory for beriberi and hypothesized that the disease was due to insufficiencies in the diet instead.<ref name="McCollum">McCollum EV. ''A History of Nutrition''. Cambridge, Mass.: Riverside Press, [[Houghton Mifflin]]; 1957.</ref> Switching diet on a navy ship, he discovered that substituting a diet of white rice only, with one also containing barley, meat, milk, bread, and vegetables nearly eliminated beriberi on a 9-month sea voyage. However, Takaki had added many foods to the successful diet and he incorrectly attributed the benefit to increased nitrogen intake, as vitamins were unknown substances at the time. Nor was the Navy convinced of the need for so expensive a program of dietary improvement, and many men continued to die of beriberi, even during the [[Russo-Japanese war]] of 1904–5. Not until 1905, after the anti-beriberi factor had been discovered in rice bran (removed by polishing into white rice) and in brown barley rice, was Takaki's experiment rewarded by making him a baron in the Japanese peerage system, after which he was affectionately called "Barley Baron".

The specific connection to grain was made in 1897 by [[Christiaan Eijkman]] (1858–1930), a military doctor in the Dutch Indies, discovered that fowl fed on a diet of cooked, polished rice developed paralysis, which could be reversed by discontinuing rice polishing.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Eijkman | first1 = C. | year = 1897 | title = Eine Beriberiähnliche Krankheit der Hühner | url = | journal = Archiv für pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie und für klinische Medizin | volume = 148 | issue = 3| pages = 523–532 | doi = 10.1007/BF01937576 }}</ref> He attributed beriberi to a nerve ''poison'' in the endosperm of rice, from which the outer layers of the grain gave protection to the body. An associate, [[Gerrit Grijns]] (1865–1944), correctly interpreted the connection between excessive consumption of polished rice and beriberi in 1901: He concluded that rice contains an essential nutrient in the outer layers of the grain that is removed by polishing.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Grijns | first1 = G. | year = 1901 | title = Over polyneuritis gallinarum | url = | journal = I. Geneesk. Tijdscht. Ned. Ind. | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 3–110 }}</ref>

Eijkman was eventually awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine]] in 1929, because his observations led to the discovery of vitamins. These compounds were named by Polish biochemist [[Casimir Funk]]. In 1911, [[Casimir Funk]] isolated the antineuritic substance from rice bran that he called a "vitamine" (on account of its containing an amino group). Dutch chemists, [[Barend Coenraad Petrus Jansen]] (1884–1962) and his closest collaborator [[Willem Frederik Donath]] (1889–1957), went on to isolate and crystallize the active agent in 1926,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Jansen | first1 = B.C.P. | last2 = Donath | first2 = W.F. | year = 1926 | title = On the isolation of antiberiberi vitamin | url = | journal = Proc. Kon. Ned. Akad. Wet. | volume = 29 |issue = | pages = 1390–1400 }}</ref> whose structure was determined by [[Robert Runnels Williams]] (1886–1965), a US chemist, in 1934. Thiamine (“sulfur-containing vitamin”) was synthesized in 1936 by the same group.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja01299a505 | last1 = Williams | first1 = R.R. | last2 = Cline | first2 = J.K. | year = 1936 | title = Synthesis of vitamin B<sub>1</sub> | url = | journal = J. Am. Chem. Soc. | volume = 58 |issue = 8| pages = 1504–1505 }}</ref>

Thiamine was ﬁrst named "aneurin" (for anti-neuritic vitamin).<ref>Carpenter KJ. Beriberi, white rice, and vitamin B: a disease, a cause, and a cure. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; 2000</ref> Sir [[Rudolph Peters]], in Oxford, introduced thiamine-deprived pigeons as a model for understanding how thiamine deficiency can lead to the pathological-physiological symptoms of beriberi. Indeed, feeding the pigeons upon polished rice leads to an easily recognizable behavior of  head retraction, a condition called [[opisthotonos]]. If not treated, the animal will die after a few days. Administration of thiamine at the stage of opisthotonos will lead to a complete cure of the animal within 30 min.
As no morphological modifications were observed in the brain of the pigeons before and after treatment with thiamine, Peeters introduced the concept of biochemical lesion.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Peters | first1 = R.A. | year = 1936 | title = The biochemical lesion in vitamin B<sub>1</sub>deficiency. Application of modern biochemical analysis in its diagnosis | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 1 | issue = 5882| pages = 1161–1164 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(01)28025-8 }}</ref>

When Lohman and Schuster (1937) showed that the diphosphorylated thiamine derivative (thiamine diphosphate, ThDP) was a cofactor required for the oxydative decarboxylation of pyruvate,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lohmann | first1 = K. | last2 = Schuster | first2 = P. | year = 1937 | title = Untersuchungen über die Cocarboxylase | url = | journal = Biochem. Z. | volume = 294 | issue = | pages = 188–214 }}</ref> (a reaction now known to be catalyzed by [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]]), the mechanism of action  of thiamine in the cellular metabolism seemed to be elucidated. At present, this view seems to be oversimplified: Pyruvate dehydrogenase is only one of several enzymes requiring thiamine diphosphate as a cofactor; moreover, other thiamine phosphate derivatives have been discovered since then, and they may also contribute to the symptoms observed during thiamine deficiency.

Finally, the mechanism by which the thiamine moiety of ThDP exerts its coenzyme function by proton substitution on position 2 of the [[thiazolium]]ring was elucidated by [[Ronald Breslow]] in 1958.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Breslow R |year=1958 |title=On the mechanism of thiamine action.
