'''Azelaic acid''' is an [[organic compound]] with the formula HOOC(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>7</sub>[[carboxylic acid|COOH]]. This saturated [[dicarboxylic acid]] exists as a white powder.  It is found in [[wheat]], [[rye]], and [[barley]].  It is a precursor to diverse industrial products including polymers and plasticizers, as well as being a component of a number of hair and skin conditioners.<ref name=Boy/>

==Production==
Azelaic acid is industrially produced by the [[ozonolysis]] of [[oleic acid]].  The side product is [[nonanoic acid]].  It is produced naturally by ''[[Malassezia furfur]]'' (also known as ''Pityrosporum ovale''), a [[yeast]] that lives on normal [[skin]]. The bacterial degradation of nonanoic acid gives azelaic acid.

==Biological function==
In plants, azelaic acid serves as a "distress flare" involved in defense responses after infection.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sarah Everts | title = Vegetative Warfare | journal = [[Chemical & Engineering News]] | date=January 31, 2011 | volume = 89 | issue = 5 | pages = 53–55 | url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/89/i5/Vegetative-Warfare.html | subscription=yes }}</ref>  It serves as a signal that induces the accumulation of [[salicylic acid]], an important component of a plant's defensive response.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Jung | first1 = H.

==Applications==

===Polymers and related materials===
Esters of this dicarboxylic acid find applications in lubrication and plasticizers. In lubricant industries it is used as a thickening agent in lithium complex grease. With hexamethylenediamine, azelaic acid forms [[Nylon]]-6,9, which finds specialized uses as a plastic.<ref name=Boy>{{cite encyclopedia|first1=Boy |last1=Cornils |first2=Peter |last2=Lappe |title=Dicarboxylic Acids, Aliphatic |encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |date=2006 |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=[[Weinheim]] |DOI=10.1002/14356007.a08_523}}</ref>

===Medical===
Azelaic acid is used to treat mild to moderate acne, both comedonal acne and inflammatory acne.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/acne/azelaic-acid-for-acne-vulgaris |title=Azelaic Acid for Acne|website=[[WebMD]]}}</ref><ref name="drugs.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/mtm/azelaic-acid-topical.html |title=Azelaic acid topical|website=Drugs.com}}</ref> It belongs to a class of medication called [[dicarboxylic acid]]s. It works by killing acne bacteria that infect skin pores. It also decreases the production of keratin, which is a natural substance that promotes the growth of acne bacteria.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Azelaic acid in the treatment of papulopustular rosacea – A systematic review of randomized controlled trials | last1 = Liu | first1 = R.
