'''Thalidomide''', sold under the brand name '''Immunoprin''', among others, is an [[immunotherapy|immunomodulatory drug]] and the prototype of the [[Discovery and development of thalidomide and its analogs|thalidomide class of drugs]]. Today, thalidomide is used mainly as a treatment of certain cancers ([[multiple myeloma]]) and of a complication of [[leprosy]]. 

<!-- History -->
Thalidomide was first marketed in 1957 in West Germany under the trade-name '''Contergan'''. The German drug company [[Grünenthal|Chemie Grünenthal]] developed and sold the drug. Primarily prescribed as a [[sedative]] or [[hypnotic]], thalidomide also claimed to cure "[[anxiety]], [[insomnia]], [[gastritis]], and tension".<ref name="miller">{{cite journal | last = Miller | first = Marylin T. | title = Thalidomide Embryopathy: A Model for the Study of Congenital Incomitant Horizontal Strabismus | journal = Transaction of the American Ophthalmological Society | year = 1991 | volume = 81 | pages = 623–674 }}</ref> Afterwards, it was used against [[nausea]] and to alleviate [[morning sickness]] in pregnant women. Thalidomide became an [[over the counter|over-the-counter]] drug in West Germany on October 1, 1957. Shortly after the drug was sold in West Germany, between 5,000 and 7,000 infants were born with [[phocomelia]] (malformation of the limbs).

==Contraindications==
Thalidomide should not be used by people who are breast feeding or pregnant, trying to conceive a child, or cannot or will not follow the risk management program to prevent pregnancies. The prescribing doctor is required to ensure that contraception is being used, and regularly pregnancy tests must be administered.   Some people are allergic to thalidomide and should not take it.  It should be used with caution in people with chronic infections like HIV or hepatitis B. <ref name=USlabel2017/><ref name=UKlabel2017/>

==Adverse effects==
{{See also|List of thalidomide side effects}}
Thalidomide [[Teratogen|causes birth defects]].<ref name=USlabel2017/><ref name=UKlabel2017/><ref name=toxmech2009>{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=SW|title=Chiral toxicology: it's the same thing...only different.|journal=Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology|date=July 2009|volume=110|issue=1|pages=4-30|doi=10.1093/toxsci/kfp097|pmid=19414517}}</ref>  The FDA and other regulatory agencies have approved marketing of the drug only with an auditable  [[risk evaluation and mitigation strategy]] that ensures that people using the drug are aware of the risks and avoid pregnancy; this applies to men and women both, as the drug can be transmitted in sperm.<ref name=toxmech2009/>

There is a high risk that thalidomide can cause excessive [[Thrombosis|blood clots]]. There is also a high risk that thalidomide can interfere with formation of various kinds of new blood cells, creating a risk of infection via [[neutropenia]], [[leukopenia]], and [[lymphopenia]], and risks that blood will not clot via [[thrombocytopenia]].  There is also a risk of [[anemia]] via lack of red blood cells.  The drug can also damage nerves, causing [[peripheral neuropathy]] that may be irreversible.<ref name=USlabel2017/><ref name=UKlabel2017/> 

Thalidomide has several cardiovascular adverse effects, including risk of [[heart attack]]s, [[pulmonary hypertension]], and changes in heart rhythm including [[syncope (medicine)|syncope]], [[bradycardia]] and [[atrioventricular block]].<ref name=USlabel2017/><ref name=UKlabel2017/> 

It can cause [[liver damage]] and severe skin reactions like [[Stevens-Johnson Syndrome]].  It tends to make people sleepy, which creates risk for driving and operating other machinery.   As it kills cancer cells, it can cause [[tumor lysis syndrome]]. Thalidomide can [[Amenorrhea|prevent menstruation]].<ref name=USlabel2017/><ref name=UKlabel2017/> 

Other than the above, very common (reported in more than 10% of people) adverse effects include tremor, dizziness, tingling, numbness, constipation, and peripheral edema.<ref name=USlabel2017/><ref name=UKlabel2017/> 

Common (reported by 1-10% of people) adverse effects include confusion, depressed mood, reduced coordination, heart failure, difficulty breathing, interstitial lung disease, lung inflammation, vomiting, dry mouth, rashes, dry skin, fever, weakness, and a sense of unwellness.<ref name=USlabel2017/><ref name=UKlabel2017/> 

===Interactions===
There are no expected [[Pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]] interactions between thalidomide and other medicines due to its neutral effects on p-glycoprotein and P450 cytochromes.  It may interact with sedatives due to its sedative action. It may also interact with bradycardic agents due to its bradycardia-inducing effects. The risk of peripheral neuropathy may be increased by concomitant treatment with other agents known to cause peripheral neuropathy.<ref name = TGA>{{cite web|title=THALOMID® CAPSULES|work=TGA eBusiness Services|publisher=Celgene Pty Limited|date=21 June 2013|accessdate=17 January 2014|url=https://www.ebs.tga.gov.au/ebs/picmi/picmirepository.nsf/pdf?OpenAgent&id=CP-2010-PI-03581-3|format=PDF}}</ref> The risk of venous thromboembolisms with thalidomide seems to be increased when patients are treated with oral contraceptives or other cytotoxic agents (including doxorubicin and melphalan) concurrently. Thalidomide may interfere with the contraceptive effects of various contraceptives and hence it is advised that women of reproductive age use at least two different means of contraception to ensure that no child will be conceived while they are receiving thalidomide.<ref name = TGA/><ref name=USlabel2017/><ref name=UKlabel2017/>

===Overdose===
As of 2013 eighteen cases of overdoses had been reported with doses of up to 14.4 g without any reported fatalities.<ref name = TGA/> No specific antidote for overdoses exists and treatment is purely supportive.<ref name = TGA/>

==Pharmacology==
The precise mechanism of action for thalidomide is unknown although efforts to identify thalidomide's [[Teratology|teratogenic]] action generated 2000 research papers and the proposal of 15 or 16 plausible mechanisms by 2000.<ref name=Stephens2000>{{cite journal | vauthors = Stephens TD, Bunde CJ, Fillmore BJ | title = Mechanism of action in thalidomide teratogenesis | journal = Biochem.

==History==
Thalidomide was [[drug discovery|discovered]] by scientists at the German pharmaceutical company ''Chemie Grünenthal'' (now ''[[Grünenthal GmbH]]'') around 1953.   The company had been set up as a soap maker just after WWII ended, to address the urgent market need for antibiotics. Heinrich Mueckter was appointed to head the discovery program based on his experience working with the German army's antiviral research program. In the course of preparing [[reagents]] for the work, Mueckter's assistant Wilhelm Kunz isolated a by-product, that was in turn recognized by pharmacologist Herbert Keller as an analog of [[glutethimide]], a [[sedative]], and the medicinal chemistry work turned to improving the lead compound into a suitable drug; the result was thalidomide.  The toxicity was examined in several animals, and the drug was introduced in 1956 as a sedative.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sneader|first1=Walter|title=Drug discovery : a history|date=2005|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester|isbn=978-0-471-89979-2|page=367|edition=Rev. and updated ed.}}</ref>

Researchers at ''Chemie Grünenthal'' also found that thalidomide was a particularly effective [[antiemetic]] that had an inhibitory effect on [[morning sickness]].<ref name=pmid15172781>{{cite journal |last1=Franks |first1=Michael E |last2=Macpherson |first2=Gordon R |last3=Figg |first3=William D |title=Thalidomide |journal=The Lancet |volume=363 |issue=9423 |pages=1802–11 |year=2004 |pmid=15172781 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16308-3 }}</ref> Hence, on October 1, 1957, the company launched thalidomide and began aggressively marketing it under the trade name ''Contergan''.<ref name="Bombay">{{cite journal |first1=Vijay V |last1=Moghe |first2=Ujjwala |last2=Kulkarni |first3=Urvashi I |last3=Parmar |year=2008 |title=Thalidomide |journal=Bombay Hospital Journal |publisher=Bombay Hospital |location=Bombay |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=472–6 |url=http://www.bhj.org.in/journal/2008_5003_july/download/page-472-476.pdf }}{{better source|date=April 2017}}</ref>{{better source|date=April 2017}} It was proclaimed a "wonder drug" for [[insomnia]], coughs, colds and headaches.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

During this time period, the use of medications during pregnancy was not strictly controlled, and drugs were not thoroughly tested for potential harm to the [[fetus]].<ref name=pmid15172781/> Thousands of pregnant women took the drug to relieve their symptoms. At the time of the drug's development, scientists did not believe any drug taken by a pregnant woman could pass across the [[placental barrier]] and harm the developing fetus,<ref name="The chemical industry"/> even though the effect of alcohol on fetal development had been documented by case studies on alcoholic mothers since at least 1957.<ref>See Rouquette (1957) cited by {{cite journal| vauthors = Landesman-Dwyer S| title = Maternal drinking and pregnancy outcome| journal = Appl Res Ment Retard| volume = 3| issue = 3| pages = 241–63| year = 1982| pmid = 7149705| doi = 10.1016/0270-3092(82)90018-2 }}</ref> There soon appeared reports of findings of abnormalities in children being born, traced back to the use of the drug thalidomide.

Hence, while initially considered safe, the drug was responsible for [[Teratology|teratogenic]] deformities in children born after their mothers used it during pregnancies, prior to the third trimester.

(now part of [[Diageo plc]]), marketed thalidomide under the brand name ''Distaval'' as a remedy for [[morning sickness]] throughout the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. Their advertisement claimed that "Distaval can be given with complete safety to pregnant women and nursing mothers without adverse effect on mother or child...Outstandingly safe Distaval has been prescribed for nearly three years in this country."<ref name="oncozine.com"/>{{dead link|date=June 2014}} Around the world, more and more pharmaceutical companies started to produce and market the drug under license from ''Chemie Grünenthal''. By the mid 1950s, 14 pharmaceutical companies were marketing thalidomide in 46 countries under 37 (some reports suggest 51) different trade names.

In the U.S., representatives from ''Chemie Grünenthal'' approached ''[[Smith, Kline & French]]'' (SKF), now [[GlaxoSmithKline]] (GSK) with a request to market and distribute the drug in North America. A memorandum rediscovered in 2010 in the archives of the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) shows that, as part of its in-licensing approach, ''Smith, Kline and French'' conducted animal tests and ran a clinical trial of the drug in the United States involving 875 people, including pregnant women, in 1956–57.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In 1956, researchers at SKF involved in clinical trials noted that even when used in very high doses, thalidomide could not induce sleep in mice.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} And when administered at doses 50 to 650 times larger than that claimed by ''Chemie Grünenthal'' to be "sleep inducing", the researchers could still not achieve the hypnotic effect in animals that it had on humans.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} After completion of the trial, and based on reasons kept hidden for decades, SKF declined to commercialize the drug. Later, ''Chemie Grünenthal'', in 1958, reached an agreement with ''William S Merrell Company'' in Cincinnati, Ohio, ([[Marion Merrell Dow#Richardson-Merrell|later Richardson-Merrell]], now part of [[Sanofi]]), to market and distribute thalidomide throughout the United States.<ref name="oncozine.com"/>{{dead link|date=June 2014}}

The U.S. FDA refused to approve thalidomide for marketing and distribution. However, the drug was distributed in large quantities for testing purposes, after the American distributor and manufacturer [[Marion Merrell Dow#Richardson-Merrell|Richardson-Merrell]] had applied for its approval in September 1960.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The official in charge of the FDA review, [[Frances Oldham Kelsey]], did not rely on information from the company, which did not include any test results. Richardson-Merrell was called on to perform tests and report the results. The company demanded approval six times, and was refused each time. Nevertheless, a total of 17 children with thalidomide-induced malformations were born in the U.S.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2001/201_kelsey.html Report] on the website of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512235601/http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2001/201_kelsey.html |date=May 12, 2009 }}</ref>

In Canada, the history of the drug thalidomide dates back to April 1, 1961. There were many different forms sold, with the most common variant being Talimol.<ref name=pmid14076167>{{cite journal | vauthors = Webb JF | title = Canadian Thalidomide Experience | journal = Can Med Assoc J | volume = 89 | issue =  | pages = 987–92 | date = November 1963 | pmid = 14076167 | pmc = 1921912 }}</ref> Two months after Talimol went on sale, pharmaceutical companies sent physicians letters warning about the risk of birth defects.<ref name=pmid14076167/> It was not until March 2, 1962, that both drugs were banned from the Canadian market by the FDD, and soon afterward physicians were warned to destroy their supplies.<ref name=pmid14076167/>

===Leprosy treatment===
In 1964, Israeli physician [[Jacob Sheskin]] administered thalidomide to a patient critically ill with leprosy. The patient exhibited [[Erythema nodosum|erythema nodosum leprosum&nbsp;(ENL)]], a painful skin condition, one of the complications of [[leprosy]]. This was attempted despite the ban on thalidomide's use, but results were favourable: the patient slept for hours and was able to get out of bed without aid upon awakening. A clinical trial studying the use of thalidomide in leprosy soon followed.<ref name="Silverman">{{cite journal | vauthors = Silverman WA | title = The schizophrenic career of a 'monster drug' | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 110 | issue = 2 Pt 1 | pages = 404–6 | date = August 2002 | pmid = 12165600 | doi = 10.1542/peds.110.2.404 }}</ref>

Thalidomide has been used by Brazilian physicians as the drug of choice for the treatment of severe ENL since 1965, and by 1996, at least 33 cases of thalidomide embryopathy were recorded in people born in Brazil after 1965.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Castilla |first1=Eduardo E. |title=Thalidomide, a current teratogen in South America |journal=Teratology |volume=54 |issue=6 |pages=273–7 |year=1996 |pmid=9098920 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1096-9926(199702)55:2<156::AID-TERA6>3.0.CO;2-1 }}</ref> Since 1994, the production, dispensing, and prescription of thalidomide have been strictly controlled, requiring women to use two forms of birth control and submit to regular pregnancy tests.

The FDA required that [[Celgene Corporation]], which planned to market thalidomide under the brand name ''Thalomid'', establish a system for thalidomide education and prescribing safety (STEPS) oversight program. The conditions required under the program include limiting prescription and dispensing rights to authorized prescribers and pharmacies only, keeping a registry of all patients prescribed thalidomide, providing extensive patient education about the risks associated with the drug, and providing periodic pregnancy tests for women who take the drug.<ref name="nyt-fda"/>

In 2010, the [[World Health Organisation|World Health Organisation (WHO)]] stated that it did not recommend thalidomide due the difficulty of adequately controlling its use, and due to the availability of [[clofazimine]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/lep/research/thalidomide/en/index.html |title=Use of thalidomide in leprosy|last=Anon|work=WHO:leprosy elimination |publisher=WHO |accessdate=22 April 2010}}</ref>

===Cancer treatment===
Shortly after the teratogenic properties of thalidomide were recognized in the mid-1960s, its anti-cancer potential was explored and two clinical trials were conducted in people with advanced cancer, including some people with multiple myeloma; the trials were inconclusive.<ref name=Kyle>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kyle RA, Rajkumar SV | date = Mar 2008 | title = Multiple myeloma | url = | journal = Blood | volume = 111 | issue = 6| pages = 2962–72 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2007-10-078022 | pmid = 18332230 | pmc=2265446}}</ref>

In Spain, thalidomide was widely available throughout the 1970s, perhaps even into the 1980s. There were two reasons for this. First, state controls and safeguarding were poor; indeed, it was not until 2008 that the government even admitted the country had ever imported thalidomide. Second, Grünenthal failed to insist that its sister company in Madrid warn Spanish doctors, and permitted it to not warn them.

Several countries either restricted the drug's use or never approved it. Ingeborg Eichler, a member of the [[Austria]]n pharmaceutical admission conference, enforced thalidomide (tradename Softenon) being sold under the rules of [[prescription medication]] and as a result relatively few affected children were born in Austria and Switzerland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://orf.at/070930-17124/index.html|title=10.000 Fälle von Missbildungen |trans_title=10,000 cases of malformations |language=German |publisher=[[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]]|accessdate=June 6, 2013}}</ref> In the United States, [[pharmacologist]] [[Frances Oldham Kelsey]] [[M.D.]] withstood pressure from the [[Marion Merrell Dow|Richardson-Merrell]] company and refused [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration (FDA)]] approval to market thalidomide, saying further studies were needed.<ref name="Bren" /> This reduced the impact of thalidomide in United States patients.

===Aftermath of scandal===
The numerous reports of malformations in babies brought about the awareness of the side effects of the drug on pregnant women. The birth defects caused by the drug thalidomide can range from moderate malformation to more severe forms. Possible birth defects include phocomelia, dysmelia, amelia, bone hypoplasticity, and other congenital defects affecting the ear, heart, or internal organs.<ref name=pmid15172781/> Franks et al. looked at how the drug affected newborn babies, the severity of their deformities, and reviewed the drug in its early years. Webb in 1963 also reviewed the history of the drug and the different forms of birth defects it had caused. "The most common form of birth defects from thalidomide is shortened limbs, with the arms being more frequently affected. This syndrome is the presence of deformities of the long bones of the limbs resulting in shortening and other abnormalities."<ref name=pmid14076167/>

====Germany====
In 1968, a large criminal trial began in Germany, charging several Grünenthal officials with negligent homicide and injury. 
After Grünenthal settled with the victims in April 1970, the trial ended in December 1970 with no finding of guilt. As part of the settlement, Grünenthal paid 100 million [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] into a special foundation; the German government added 320 million DM. The foundation paid victims a one-time sum of 2,500-25,000 DM (depending on severity of disability) and a monthly stipend of 100-450 DM. The monthly stipends have since been raised substantially and are now paid entirely by the government (as the foundation had run out of money). Grünenthal paid another 50 million Euros into the foundation in 2008.

On 31 August 2012, Grünenthal chief executive Harald F. Stock, PhD, who served as the Chief Executive Officer of Grünenthal [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|GmbH]] from January 2009 to May 28, 2013 and was also a Member of Executive Board until May 28, 2013, apologized for the first time for producing the drug and remaining silent about the birth defects.<ref>{{cite web|title=Speech on the occasion of the inauguration of Thalidomide-Memorial|url=http://www.contergan.grunenthal.info/grt-ctg/GRT-CTG/Stellungnahme/Rede_anlaesslich_Einweihung_des_Contergan-Denkmals/224600963.jsp|website=Grünenthal GmbH Website|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901184544/http://www.contergan.grunenthal.info/grt-ctg/GRT-CTG/Stellungnahme/Rede_anlaesslich_Einweihung_des_Contergan-Denkmals/224600963.jsp|archivedate=2012-09-01}}</ref> At a ceremony, Stock unveiled a statue of a disabled child to symbolize those harmed by thalidomide and apologized for not trying to reach out to victims for over 50&nbsp;years. At the time of the apology, there were 5,000 to 6,000 sufferers still alive. Victim advocates called the apology "insulting" and "too little, too late", and criticized the company for not compensating victims.

====Canada====
The drug thalidomide's birth defects in children affected many people's lives, and from these events came the formation of the group called [[The Thalidomide Victims Association of Canada]], a group of 120 Canadian survivors.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Warren R | title = Living in a World With Thalidomide: A Dose of Reality | journal = FDA Consumer | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | page = 40 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11444250 | url = http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps1609/www.fda.gov/fdac/departs/2001/201_word.html }}</ref><ref>[http://www.thalidomide.ca/tvac-mission/ The Thalidomide Victims Association of Canada]</ref> Their goal was to prevent future usage of drugs that could be of potential harm to mothers and babies. The members from the thalidomide victims association were involved in the STEPS program, which aimed to prevent teratogenicity.<ref name=pmid15172781/>

The effects of thalidomide increased fears regarding the safety of pharmaceutical drugs.

According to [[W5 (TV series)|Canadian news magazine program ''W5'']], most, but not all, victims  of thalidomide receive annual benefits as compensation from the [[Government of Canada]]. Excluded are those who cannot provide the documentation the government requires.<ref>{{cite news |title=The plight of the thalidomide 'sample babies' who don't qualify for gov't compensation |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/w5/the-plight-of-the-thalidomide-sample-babies-who-don-t-qualify-for-gov-t-compensation-1.3176590 |work=W5 |accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref>

==Research==
Research efforts have been focused on determination how thalidomide causes birth defects and its other activities in the human body, efforts to develop safer analogs, and efforts to find further uses for thalidomide. 

===Thalidomide analogs===
