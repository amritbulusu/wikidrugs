==Adverse effects==
* Cardiovascular events: <!-- [US Boxed Warning]: --> NSAIDs are associated with an increased risk of serious (and potentially fatal) adverse cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke. Risk may be increased with duration of use or pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors or disease. Individual cardiovascular risk profiles should be evaluated prior to prescribing. New-onset [[hypertension]] or exacerbation of [[hypertension]] may occur (NSAIDs may impair response to thiazide or loop diuretics), and may contribute to cardiovascular events; monitor blood pressure and use with caution in patients with hypertension. May cause sodium and fluid retention, use with caution in patients with edema or heart failure. Long-term cardiovascular risk in children has not been evaluated. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration of time, consistent with individual patient goals, to reduce risk of cardiovascular events; alternative therapies should be considered for patients at high risk.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Solomon SD, McMurray JJ, Pfeffer MA, Wittes J, Fowler R, Finn P, Anderson WF, Zauber A, Hawk E, Bertagnolli M | title = Cardiovascular risk associated with celecoxib in a clinical trial for colorectal adenoma prevention | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 352 | issue = 11 | pages = 1071–1080 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15713944 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa050405 | publisher = Adenoma Prevention with Celecoxib (APC) Study Investigators }}</ref>
* Gastrointestinal events: <!-- [US Boxed Warning]: --> NSAIDs may increase risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) ulceration, bleeding, and perforation (may be fatal). These events may occur at any time during therapy and without warning. Use caution with a history of GI disease (bleeding or ulcers), concurrent therapy with aspirin, anticoagulants and/or corticosteroids, smoking, use of alcohol, the elderly or debilitated patients. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration of time, consistent with individual patient goals, to reduce risk of GI adverse events; alternate therapies should be considered for patients at high risk. When used concomitantly with ≤325&nbsp;mg of aspirin, a substantial increase in the risk of gastrointestinal complications (e.g., ulcer) occurs; concomitant gastroprotective therapy (e.g., proton pump inhibitors) is recommended.<ref name="Drug Label"/>
* Hematologic effects: Anemia may occur; monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit in people on long-term treatment. Celecoxib does not usually affect [[prothrombin time]], [[partial thromboplastin time]] or [[platelet]] counts; it does not inhibit platelet aggregation at approved doses.

People with prior history of ulcer disease or GI bleeding require special precaution. Moderate to severe liver impairment or GI toxicity can occur with or without warning symptoms in people treated with NSAIDs.

===Allergy===
Celecoxib contains a [[sulfonamide (chemistry)|sulfonamide]] moiety and may cause allergic reactions in those allergic to other sulfonamide-containing drugs. This is in addition to the contraindication in people with severe allergies to other NSAIDs. However, it has a low (reportedly 4%) chance of inducing cutaneous reactions among persons who have a history of such reactions to aspirin or nonselective NSAIDs. NSAIDs may cause serious skin adverse events, including exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis; events may occur without warning and in patients without prior known sulfa allergy. Use should be discontinued at first sign of rash (or any other hypersensitivity).

===Heart attack and stroke===
The coxibs (which includes celecoxib) increase the risk of major cardiovascular problems by about 37%.<ref name=Coxib2013>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bhala N, Emberson J, Merhi A, Abramson S, Arber N, Baron JA, Bombardier C, Cannon C, Farkouh ME, FitzGerald GA, Goss P, Halls H, Hawk E, Hawkey C, Hennekens C, Hochberg M, Holland LE, Kearney PM, Laine L, Lanas A, Lance P, Laupacis A, Oates J, Patrono C, Schnitzer TJ, Solomon S, Tugwell P, Wilson K, Wittes J, Baigent C | title = Vascular and upper gastrointestinal effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: meta-analyses of individual participant data from randomised trials | journal = Lancet | volume = 382 | issue = 9894 | pages = 769–79 | date = Aug 31, 2013 | pmid = 23726390 | pmc = 3778977 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60900-9 }}</ref> Naproxen does not significantly increase the rate of major vascular events.<ref name=Coxib2013/>

The COX-2 inhibitor [[rofecoxib]] (Vioxx) was removed from the market in 2004 due to its risk. Like all NSAIDs on the US market, celecoxib carries an FDA-mandated "black box warning" for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal risk. In February 2007, the [[American Heart Association]] warned that with respect to "patients with a prior history of or at high risk for cardiovascular disease... use of COX-2 inhibitors for pain relief should be limited to patients for whom there are no appropriate alternatives, and then, only in the lowest dose and for the shortest duration necessary."<ref name="AHA2007">{{cite journal |vauthors=Antman EM, etal | date = Mar 2007 | title = Use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs: an update for clinicians: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association | url = http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/115/12/1634.full.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Circulation | volume = 115 | issue = 12| pages = 1634–42 | doi=10.1161/circulationaha.106.181424 | pmid=17325246}}</ref>

===Drug interactions===
Celecoxib is predominantly metabolized by [[cytochrome]] P450 2C9. Caution must be exercised with concomitant use of 2C9 inhibitors, such as [[fluconazole]], which can greatly elevate celecoxib serum levels.<ref name="Drug Label"/> If used concomitantly with lithium, celecoxib increases lithium plasma levels.<ref name="Drug Label"/> If used concomitantly with warfarin, celecoxib may result in increased risk of bleeding complications.<ref name="Drug Label"/> The drug may increase the risk of kidney failure with [[angiotensin]]-converting enzyme-inhibitors, such as [[lisinopril]], and [[diuretic]]s, such as [[hydrochlorothiazide]].<ref name=Label>[http://labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=793 Celebrex label] Accessed December 27, 2012</ref>

===Pregnancy===

In the US FDA's [[Pregnancy Category|pregnancy categories]], the drug is category C prior to 30 weeks gestation, and category D starting at 30 weeks gestation.<ref name=Label/>

==Mechanism of action==

===Anti-inflammatory===
A highly selective reversible inhibitor of the [[COX-2]] isoform of [[cyclooxygenase]], celecoxib inhibits the transformation of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin precursors. Therefore, it has antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties.<ref name="Drug Label"/> Nonselective NSAIDs (such as aspirin, naproxen, and ibuprofen) inhibit both [[COX-1]] and COX-2. Inhibition of COX-1 (which celecoxib does not inhibit at therapeutic concentrations) inhibits the production of prostaglandins and the production of thromboxane A2, a platelet activator.<ref name="Drug Label"/> COX-1 is traditionally defined as a constitutively expressed "housekeeping" enzyme and plays a role in the protection of the gastrointestinal mucosa, kidney hemodynamics, and platelet thrombogenesis.<ref name=Mathew>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mathew ST, Devi SG, Prasanth VV, Vinod B | title = Efficacy and Safety of COX-2 Inhibitors in the Clinical Management of Arthritis: Mini Review. | journal = ISRN pharmacology | volume = 2011 | page = 480291 | date = 2011 | pmid = 22084715 | pmc = 3197256 | doi = 10.5402/2011/480291 }}</ref><ref name="Katzung">{{cite book|last=Katzung|first=edited by Bertram G.|title=Basic & clinical pharmacology|date=2007|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=9780071451536|page=579|edition=10th}}</ref> COX-2, on the contrary, is extensively expressed in cells involved in inflammation and is upregulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharides, cytokines, growth factors, and tumor promoters.<ref name=Mathew/><ref name="Shi S and Koltz U">{{cite journal |vauthors=Shi S, Klotz U | title = Clinical use and pharmacological properties of selective COX-2 inhibitors. | journal = European journal of clinical pharmacology | volume = 64 | issue = 3 | pages = 233–52 | date = Mar 2008 | pmid = 17999057 | doi = 10.1007/s00228-007-0400-7 }}</ref> Celecoxib is approximately 10-20 times more selective for COX-2 inhibition over COX-1.<ref name="Katzung"/><ref>{{cite journal | author = Conaghan PG | title = A turbulent decade for NSAIDs: update on current concepts of classification, epidemiology, comparative efficacy, and toxicity. | journal = Rheumatology international | volume = 32 | issue = 6 | pages = 1491–502 | date = Jun 2012 | pmid = 22193214 | pmc = 3364420 | doi = 10.1007/s00296-011-2263-6 }}</ref> It binds with its polar [[Sulfonamide (chemistry)|sulfonamide side chain]] to a hydrophilic side pocket region close to the active COX-2 binding site.<ref name="DiPiro, Joseph T. 2008">DiPiro, Joseph T., Robert L.

The Searle research group found the two appropriately substituted aromatic rings must reside on adjacent positions about the central ring for adequate COX-2 inhibition. Various modifications can be made to the 1,5-diarylpyrazole moiety to deduce the structure-activity relationship of celecoxib.<ref name="Penning">{{cite journal |vauthors=Penning TD, Talley JJ, Bertenshaw SR, Carter JS, Collins PW, Docter S, Graneto MJ, Lee LF, Malecha JW, Miyashiro JM, Rogers RS, Rogier DJ, Yu SS, Burton EG, Cogburn JN, Gregory SA, Koboldt CM, Perkins WE, Seibert K, Veenhuizen AW, Zhang YY, Isakson PC | title = Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of the 1.5 Diarylpyrazole Class of Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors: Identification of 4-[5-(4-Methylphenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazole-1-yl]benzenesulfonamide (SC-58634, Celecoxib) | journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 40 | issue = 9 | pages = 1347–1365 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9135032 | doi = 10.1021/jm960803q | url = }}</ref> A para-sulfamoylphenyl at position 1 of the pyrazole was found to have a higher potency for COX-2 selective inhibition than a para-methoxyphenyl (see structures 1 and 2, below). In addition, a 4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl or 4-sulfamoylphenyl is known to be necessary for COX-2 inhibition. For instance, replacing either of these entities with a –SO<sub>2</sub>NHCH<sub>3</sub> substituent diminishes COX-2 inhibitory activity as noted with a very high inhibitory concentration-50 (see structures 3 – 5). At the 3-position of the pyrazole, a trifluoromethyl or difluoromethyl provides superior selectivity and potency compared to a fluoromethyl or methyl substitution (see structures 6 – 9).<ref name="Penning"/>

Celecoxib is compound 22; the 4-sulfamoylphenyl on the 1-pyrazol substituent is required for COX-2 inhibition and the 4-methyl on the 5-pyrazol system has low steric hindrance to maximize potency, while the 3-trifluoromethyl group provides superior selectivity and potency.<ref name="Penning" /> To explain the selectivity of celecoxib, it is necessary to analyze the free energy of binding difference between the drug molecule and COX-1 compared to COX-2 enzymes. The structural modifications highlight the importance of binding to residue 523 in the side binding pocket of the cyclooxygenase enzyme, which is an isoleucine in COX-1 and a valine in COX-2.<ref name="Price">{{cite journal |vauthors=Price ML, Jorgensen WL | title = Rationale for the observed COX-2/COX-1 selectivity of celecoxib from Monte Carlo simulations | journal = Bioorg.

==History==
{{See also|Discovery and development of cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors}}
Two lawsuits arose over discovery of celecoxib. Daniel L.

G.D. Searle & Co.'', 358 F.3d 916 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The court ruled in favor of Searle in 2004, holding in essence that the university had claimed a method requiring, yet provided no written description of, a compound that could inhibit COX-2 and therefore the patent was invalid.<ref name="hodgsonruss">[http://www.hodgsonruss.com/Home/Practice_Areas/Alphabetical_Listing/Intellectual_Property_Technology/Articles/20012004Articles/Reach-ThroughClaimsDeclaredInvalid Reach-Through Claims Declared Invalid]</ref><ref name="kayescholer">Ranjana Kadle (2004) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130721100341/http://www.kayescholer.com/professionals/sobel_gerald_extras/misc/01_Rochester2_FedCir_Affirm.pdf CAFC Court Decision Reach-Through Claims Declared Invalid]</ref>

According to the [[National Academy of Sciences]], [[Philip Needleman]], who was vice president of [[Monsanto]] in 1989 and president of [[G. D. Searle & Company|Searle]] in 1993<ref name="NASO" /> oversaw research into [[COX-2]] that led to the development of the anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib (Celebrex).<ref name="NASO" /> He became senior executive vice president and chief scientist of [[Pharmacia]] from 2000 to 2003.<ref name="NASO">{{cite web | url=http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/podcasts/interviews/philip-needleman.html?referrer=https://www.google.ca/ | title=Philip Needleman | publisher=National Academy of Sciences | date=15 June 2015 | accessdate=28 December 2015}}</ref> Celecoxib was discovered and<ref>{{US patent | 5466823}}</ref> developed by G.

Monsanto merged with [[Pharmacia]], from which the Medical Research Division was acquired by Pfizer, giving Pfizer ownership of Celebrex. The drug was at the core of a major patent dispute that was resolved in Searle's favor (later Pfizer) in 2004.<ref name="hodgsonruss" /><ref name="kayescholer" /> In ''University of Rochester v. G.D. Searle & Co.'', 358 F.3d 916 (Fed. Cir. 2004), the [[University of Rochester]] claimed that United States Pat. No. 6,048,850 (which claimed a method of inhibiting COX-2 in humans using a compound, without actually disclosing what that compound might be) covered drugs such as celecoxib. The court ruled in favor of Searle, holding in essence that the University had claimed a method requiring, yet provided no written description of, a compound that could inhibit COX-2 and therefore the patent was invalid.

After the withdrawal of rofecoxib from the market in September 2004, Celebrex enjoyed a robust increase in sales. However, the results of the APC trial in December of that year raised concerns that Celebrex might carry risks similar to those of rofecoxib, and Pfizer announced a moratorium on [[direct-to-consumer advertising]] of Celebrex soon afterwards. After a significant drop, sales of Celebrex have recovered, and reached $2 billion in 2006.<ref name="AHA2007"/>

Pfizer resumed advertising Celebrex in magazines in 2006,<ref name="Berenson">{{cite news |author=Berenson A |title=Celebrex Ads Are Back, Dire Warnings and All |work=The New York Times |date=April 29, 2006 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/29/business/media/29celebrex.html }}</ref> and resumed television advertising in April 2007 with an unorthodox, {{frac|2|1|2}}-minute advertisement which extensively discussed the adverse effects of Celebrex in comparison with other anti-inflammatory drugs.

In late 2007, Pfizer released another US television ad for Celebrex, which also discussed celecoxib's adverse effects in comparison with those of other anti-inflammatory drugs.

==Society and culture==

===Fabricated efficacy studies===
[[Pfizer]] and its partner, [[Pharmacia]] presented findings from their study that Celebrex was "better in protecting the stomach from serious complications than other drugs."<ref name="nytimes_2012_June" /> This became Celebrex's main selling point. However, following federal investigations it was revealed that Pfizer and Pharmacia "only presented the results from the first six months of a year long study rather than the whole thing." These partial results were then published in [[The Journal of the American Medical Association]].<ref name="nytimes_2012_June" /> In 2001 [[Food and Drug Administration]] released the full results of the Pfizer and Pharmacia study which showed that they had withheld crucial data.<ref name="nytimes_2012_June" /> By 2012 a federal judge unsealed "thousands of pages of internal documents and depositions" in a "long-running securities fraud case against Pfizer."<ref name="nytimes_2012_June" />

On March 11, 2009, [[Scott S. Reuben]], former chief of acute pain at [[Baystate Medical Center]], Springfield, Massachusetts, revealed that the data for 21 studies he had authored for the efficacy of the drug (along with others such as [[Vioxx]]) had been fabricated. The analgesic effects of the drugs had been exaggerated. Reuben was also a former paid spokesperson for Pfizer. Although from 2002 to 2007 Pfizer underwrote much of Dr. Reuben's research and "many of his trials found that Celebrex and Lyrica, Pfizer drugs, were effective against postoperative pain," Pfizer was not aware of the fraudulent data.<ref name="nyt0311" /><ref name="nyt0311">{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/health/research/11pain.html?ref=us |title=Doctor Admits Pain Studies Were Frauds, Hospital Says |work=[[The New York Times]] |date= March 11, 2009 |accessdate=December 27, 2015 }}</ref> None of the retracted studies were submitted to either the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] or the European Union's regulatory agencies prior to the drug's approval.

===Cancer prevention===
The role celecoxib might have in reducing the rates of certain cancers has been the subject of many studies. However, no current medical recommendation exists to use this drug for cancer reduction.

The use of celecoxib to reduce the risk of [[colorectal cancer]] has been investigated, but neither celecoxib nor any other drug is indicated for this use.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rial NS, etal | date = Aug 2012 | title = Clinical end points for developing pharmaceuticals to manage patients with a sporadic or genetic risk of colorectal cancer | url = | journal = Expert Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol | volume = 6 | issue = 4| pages = 507–17 | pmid = 22928902 | pmc = 3587976 | doi=10.1586/egh.12.23}}</ref> Small-scale clinical trials in very high-risk people (belonging to FAP families) showed celecoxib can prevent polyp growth.

===Cancer treatment===
Different from cancer prevention, cancer treatment is focused on the therapy of tumors that have already formed and have established themselves inside the patient. Many studies are going on to determine whether celecoxib might be useful for this latter condition.<ref name="Dannenberg">{{cite journal |vauthors=Dannenberg AJ, Subbaramaiah K | title = Targeting cyclooxygenase-2 in human neoplasia: rationale and promise | journal = [[Cancer Cell (journal)|Cancer Cell]] | volume = 4 | issue = 6 | pages = 431–6 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14706335 | doi = 10.1016/S1535-6108(03)00310-6 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1535610803003106 }}</ref> However, during molecular studies in the laboratory, it became apparent that celecoxib could interact with other intracellular components besides its most famous target, COX-2. The discovery of these additional targets has generated much controversy, and the initial assumption that celecoxib reduces tumor growth primarily by the inhibition of COX-2 became contentious.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Schönthal AH | title = Direct non-cyclooxygenase-2 targets of celecoxib and their potential relevance for cancer therapy | journal = Br. J. Cancer | volume = 97 | issue = 11 | pages = 1465–8 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 17955049 | pmc = 2360267 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bjc.6604049 | url = }}</ref>

Certainly, the inhibition of COX-2 is paramount for the anti-inflammatory and analgesic function of celecoxib. However, whether inhibition of COX-2 also plays a dominant role in this drug's anticancer effects is unclear. For example, a recent study with [[malignant tumor]] cells showed celecoxib could inhibit the growth of these cells ''[[in vitro]]'', but COX-2 played no role in this outcome; even more strikingly, the anticancer effects of celecoxib were also obtained with the use of cancer cell types that do not even contain COX-2.<ref name="Chuang">{{cite journal |vauthors=Chuang HC, Kardosh A, Gaffney KJ, Petasis NA, Schönthal AH | title = COX-2 inhibition is neither necessary nor sufficient for celecoxib to suppress tumor cell proliferation and focus formation in vitro | journal = Molecular Cancer | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | page = 38 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18485224 | pmc = 2396175 | doi = 10.1186/1476-4598-7-38 | url = http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/7/1/38 }}</ref>

Additional support for the idea that other targets besides COX-2 are important for celecoxib's anticancer effects has come from studies with chemically modified versions of celecoxib. Several dozen [[Analog (chemistry)|analog]]s of celecoxib were generated with small alterations in their [[chemical structure]]s.<ref name="zhu">{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhu J, Song X, Lin HP, Young DC, Yan S, Marquez VE, Chen CS | title = Using cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors as molecular platforms to develop a new class of apoptosis-inducing agents | journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute | volume = 94 | issue = 23 | pages = 1745–57 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12464646 | doi = 10.1093/jnci/94.23.1745 | url = http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/94/23/1745.full.pdf }}</ref> Some of these analogs retained COX-2 inhibitory activity, whereas many others did not. However, when the ability of all these compounds to kill tumor cells in [[cell culture]] was investigated, the antitumor potency did not at all depend on whether or not the respective compound could inhibit COX-2, showing the inhibition of COX-2 was not required for the anticancer effects.<ref name="zhu"/><ref name="Schönthal-analogs">{{cite journal |vauthors=Schönthal AH, Chen TC, Hofman FM, Louie SG, Petasis NA | title = Celecoxib analogs that lack COX-2 inhibitory function: preclinical development of novel anticancer drugs | journal = [[Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs]] | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 197–208 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18230053 | doi = 10.1517/13543784.17.2.197 | url = }}</ref> One of these compounds, [[2,5-dimethyl-celecoxib]], which entirely lacks the ability to inhibit COX-2, actually displayed stronger anticancer activity than celecoxib.<ref name="Schönthal-antitumor">{{cite journal | author = Schönthal AH | title = Antitumor properties of dimethyl-celecoxib, a derivative of celecoxib that does not inhibit cyclooxygenase-2: implications for glioma therapy | journal = Neurosurgical Focus | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = E21 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16709027 | doi = 10.3171/foc.2006.20.4.14 | url = }}
