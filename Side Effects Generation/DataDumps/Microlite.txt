'''Microlite''' is a pale-yellow, reddish-brown, or black [[Cubic (crystal system)|isometric]] [[mineral]] composed of [[sodium]] [[calcium]] [[tantalum]] [[oxide]] with a small amount of [[fluorine]]  (Na,Ca)<sub>2</sub>Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>(O,OH,F). Microlite is a mineral in the [[pyrochlore]] group that occurs in [[pegmatite]]s and constitutes an [[ore]] of tantalum. It has a [[Mohs hardness]] of 5.5 and a variable [[specific gravity]] of 4.2 to 6.4. It occurs as disseminated  microscopic subtranslucent to opaque octahedral [[crystal]]s with a [[refractive index]] of 2.0 to 2.2. Microlite is also called djalmaite.

Microlite occurs as a primary mineral in lithium-bearing granite pegmatites, and in [[Miarolitic cavity|miarolitic cavities]] in granites. Association minerals include: [[albite]], [[lepidolite]], [[topaz]], [[beryl]], [[tourmaline]], [[spessartine]], [[tantalite]] and [[fluorite]].

Microlite was first described in 1835 for an occurrence on the Island of Uto, State of Stockholm, [[Sweden]]. A [[Type locality (geology)|type locality]] is the Clark Ledges pegmatite, Chesterfield, [[Hampshire County, Massachusetts]]. The name is from Greek ''mikros'' for "small" and ''lithos'' for "stone."
