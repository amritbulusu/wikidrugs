'''1-Testosterone''' (abbreviated and nicknamed as '''1-Testo''', '''1-T'''), also known as '''δ<sup>1</sup>-dihydrotestosterone''' ('''δ<sup>1</sup>-DHT'''), as well as '''dihydroboldenone''', is a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]] [[anabolic-androgenic steroid]] (AAS) and [[chemical derivative|derivative]] of [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT) which was never marketed. It differs from [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]] by having a 1(2)-[[double bond]] instead of a 4(5)-double bond in its [[:File:Steroid numbering.svg|A ring]].<ref name="Llewellyn2009">{{cite book|author=William Llewellyn|title=Anabolics|edition=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3-FAQgAACAAJ|date=2009|publisher=Molecular Nutrition|isbn=978-0-9679304-7-3|page=22,135}}</ref> It was legally sold online in the [[United States]] until 2005, when it was reclassified as a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule III controlled substances|Schedule III]] [[drug]].

==Side effects==
{{See also|Anabolic steroid#Adverse effects}}

==Pharmacology==
A 2006 study determined that 1-testosterone has a high androgenic and anabolic potency even without being metabolized, so it can be characterized as a typical anabolic steroid. 1-Testosterone binds in a manner that is highly selective to the [[androgen receptor]] (AR) and has a high potency to stimulate AR-dependent [[transactivation]]. ''In vivo'', an equimolar dose of 1-testosterone has the same potency to stimulate the growth of the [[prostate]], the [[seminal vesicle]]s and the androgen-sensitive [[levator ani]] [[muscle]] as the reference anabolic steroid [[testosterone propionate]], but, unlike testosterone propionate, 1-testosterone also increases [[liver]] weight.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Friedel A, Geyer H, Kamber M, Laudenbach-Leschowsky U, Schänzer W, Thevis M, Vollmer G, Zierau O, Diel P |title=17beta-hydroxy-5alpha-androst-1-en-3-one (1-testosterone) is a potent androgen with anabolic properties |journal=Toxicol.

1-Testosterone, also known as '''4,5α-dihydro-δ<sup>1</sup>-testosterone''' ('''Δ<sup>1</sup>-DHT''') or as '''5α-androst-1-en-17β-ol-3-one''', is a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]] [[androstane]] [[steroid]] and a [[chemical derivative|derivative]] of [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT).

===Derivatives===
Two [[prohormone]]s of 1-testosterone are [[1-androstenediol]] and [[1-androstenedione]], the latter of which may be [[chemical synthesis|synthesized]] from [[stanolone acetate]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang H, Qiu Z |title=An efficient synthesis of 5&alpha;-androst-1-ene-3,17-dione |journal=Steroids |volume=71 |issue=13-14 |pages=1088–90 |pmid=17123559 |doi=10.1016/j.steroids.2006.09.008|date=December  2006}}</ref>

[[Mesabolone]] is a ketal made from 1-testosterone. 

1-Testosterone also is known to be used to synthesize [[mestanolone]] and [[metenolone]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

[[Methyl-1-testosterone]] is the 17α-methyl derivative of 1-testosterone.

===Detection in body fluids===
[[Doping (sport)|Doping]] with 1-testosterone can be detected in urine samples using [[gas chromatography]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = S. Jain, A. Beotra and T.
