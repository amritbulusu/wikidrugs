'''Troxipide''' is a drug used in the treatment of [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]]. Troxipide is a systemic non-antisecretory gastric cytoprotective agent with anti-ulcer, anti-inflammatory and mucus secreting properties irrespective of pH of stomach or duodenum. Troxipide is currently marketed in Japan (Aplace),<ref>Aplace tablets, Kyorin Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Japan</ref> China (Shuqi),<ref>Shuqi tablets, Zhongzhu Holding Co., Ltd., China</ref> South Korea (Defensa),<ref>Defensa tablets, Il Hwa, Korea</ref> and India (Troxip).<ref>Troxip tablets, Zuventus Healthcare Ltd., India</ref> It is used for the management of [[gastric ulcer]]s, and amelioration of gastric mucosal lesions in acute [[gastritis]] and acute exacerbation of chronic gastritis.

== Mechanism of action ==

The gastric pH and content independent properties of troxipide include the following:

=== Gastric mucosal protection ===

[[Gastric mucosa]] typically is composed of salts and other dialyzable components, free proteins, carbohydrate rich glycoprotein and water. Troxipide fortifies this [[gastric mucosal barrier]] by increasing the content of [[glucosamine]], [[mucopolysaccharides]] and [[collagen]].<ref name="pmid6489865">{{cite journal |vauthors=Abe Y, Sekiguchi H, Tsuru K, Irikura T |title=Effects of 3,4,5-trimethoxy-N-(3-piperidyl) benzamide (KU-54) on the incorporation (excretion) of <sup>14</sup>C-glucosamine in the gastric mucosa and the liver of rats (Article in Japanese) |journal=Nihon Yakurigaku Zasshi |year=1984 |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=11–8 |pmid=6489865}}</ref><ref name="Trox1">Prescribing information of APLACE (Troxipide). 2008.

=== Stimulation of cytoprotective prostaglandins ===

Almost all of the gastric mucosal defense mechanisms are stimulated and/or facilitated by [[prostaglandins]] (PGs), especially [[prostaglandin E2|PGE<sub>2</sub>]].<ref name="pmid18549814">{{cite journal |vauthors=Laine L, Takeuchi K, Tarnawski A |title=Gastric mucosal defense and cytoprotection: bench to bedside |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=135 |issue=1 |pages=41–60 |pmid=18549814 |doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2008.05.030}}</ref> These cytoprotective PGs stimulate mucus, bicarbonate, and phospholipid secretion; increase mucosal blood flow; and accelerate epithelial [[Gastric mucosal restitution|restitution and mucosal healing]]. They also inhibit [[mast cell]] activation, and [[leukocyte]] and [[platelet]] adherence to the vascular endothelium. Thus, continuous generation of PGE<sub>2</sub> by gastric mucosa is crucial for the maintenance of mucosal integrity and protection against ulcerogenic and necrotizing agents.<ref name="pmid18549814" /> Troxipide is known to stimulate the release of PGE<sub>2</sub> and [[prostaglandin D2|PGD<sub>2</sub>]] in experimental as well as clinical studies. Troxipide has been observed to enhance PG-stimulated increase in gastric mucosal output, accelerated epithelial restitution and mucosal healing.<ref name="current1">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mine T, Kataoka A, Fujisaki J |title=Effects of cimetidine and troxipide on gastric mucosal prostaglandin synthesis in patients with chronic gastric ulcer |journal=Curr Ther Res |volume=50 |issue=6 |pages=878–87}}</ref>

=== Suppression of gastric inflammation ===

Gastric inflammation is a highly complex biochemical protective response to cellular injury.<ref name="pmid11237100">{{cite journal |vauthors=Yoshikawa T, Naito Y |title=The role of neutrophils and inflammation in gastric mucosal injury |journal=Free Radic Res |year=2000 |volume=33 |issue=6 |pages=785–94 |pmid=11237100 |doi=10.1080/10715760000301301}}</ref> In the multitude of mechanisms involved in the development of gastric mucosal inflammation, derangement of the microcirculatory system is a common initial pathway.<ref name="springer1">{{cite journal |vauthors=Suzuki H, Masaoka T, Suzuki M, Ishii H |title=Microvascular Pathophysiology in Gastric Mucosal Inflammation Associated with Helicobacter pylori Infection |journal=Keio Univ Symp Life Sci Med |year=2005 |volume=13 |pages=63–72 |doi=10.1007/4-431-27174-0_8}}</ref>

Troxipide inhibits various proinflammatory mediators present at different stages of the microcirculatory system, thereby restoring the normal gastric mucosa. Troxipide caused the inhibition of recombinant [[interleukin-8]] (IL-8) induced migration of the inflammatory cells.<ref name="pmid11515628"/> Two other pro-inflammatory mediators causing oxidative stress that are inhibited by Troxipide include the [[Chemotactic peptide|formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine]] (fMLP) and the [[Platelet-activating factor|Platelet Activating Factor]] (PAF).<ref name="pmid11515628" />

In addition to inhibition of pro-inflammatory mediators, troxipide directly acts on the enzymes such as xanthine oxidase and myeloperoxidase that generate free oxygen radicals in gastric mucosa.<ref name="pmid7959422">{{cite journal |vauthors=Momo K, Hoshina K, Ishibashi Y, Saito T |title=Preventive effects of troxipide on a newly developed model of acute gastric mucosal lesion (AGML) induced by ischemia/reperfusion plus ammonia in the rat (Article in Japanese) |journal=Nihon Yakurigaku Zasshi |year=1994 |volume=104 |issue=4 |pages=313–23 |pmid=7959422 |doi=10.1254/fpj.104.313}}</ref> Experimental studies have demonstrated that troxipide restrains [[NSAID]]-induced generation of porphyrins, tissue peroxidation and gastric lesion formation.<ref name="pmid11281183">{{cite journal |vauthors=Matsui H, Murata Y, Kobayashi F, Shiba R, Momo K, Kondo Y, Nakahara A, Muto H |title=Diclofenac-induced gastric mucosal fluorescence in rats |journal=Dig Dis Sci |year=2001 |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=338–44 |pmid=11281183 |doi=10.1023/A:1005656916830}}</ref>

=== Enhancement of mucosal metabolism ===

Gastric [[parietal cell]]s are rich in mitochondria which provide energy in the form of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] for cells by oxidative phosphorylation, critical to maintain the proper morphology and function of gastric mucosa. The mitochondrion is the major target of intracellular oxidative stress associated with aggressive factors like ''[[H. pylori]]'', alcohol and [[NSAID]]s,<ref name="pmid18855985">{{cite journal |vauthors=Pan JS, He SZ, Xu HZ, Zhan XJ, Yang XN, Xiao HM, Shi HX, Ren JL |title=Oxidative stress disturbs energy metabolism of mitochondria in ethanol-induced gastric mucosa injury |journal=World J Gastroenterol |year=2008 |volume=14 |issue=38 |pages=5857–67 |pmid=18855985 |doi=10.3748/wjg.14.5857 |pmc=2751896}}</ref> which disturb the energy metabolism of mitochondria. Troxipide accelerates oxygen intake of marginal gastric mucosa and glycogen consumptive stimulation of the gastric mucosa of the corpus,<ref name="pmid6745811">{{cite journal |vauthors=Abe Y, Sekiguchi H, Tsuru K, Irikura T |title=Effects of 3,4,5-trimethoxy-N-(3-piperidyl) benzamide (KU-54) on respiration of the gastric mucosa and liver in rats (Article in Japanese) |journal=Nihon Yakurigaku Zasshi |year=1984 |volume=83 |issue=4 |pages=317–24 |pmid=6745811 |doi=10.1254/fpj.83.317}}</ref> thereby elevating the tissue respiration and energy metabolism.

=== Stimulation of mucosal microcirculation ===

Troxipide enhances mucosal blood flow, which is the secondary defense barrier of gastric mucosa that supplies nutrients and oxygen to the epithelium, and removes, dilutes and neutralizes toxic substances that have diffused into the mucosa from the lumen.<ref name="pmid8635690">{{cite journal |vauthors=Wallace JL, Granger DN |title=The cellular and molecular basis of gastric mucosal defense |journal=FASEB J |year=1996 |volume=10 |issue=7 |pages=731–40 |pmid=8635690 |url=http://www.fasebj.org/content/10/7/731.abstract}}</ref><ref name="pmid7203276">{{cite journal |vauthors=Abe Y, Irikura T |title=Influence of 3-(3, 4, 5-trimethoxybenzamido) piperidine (KU-54) on gastric mucosal blood flow (author's transl) |journal=Nihon Yakurigaku Zasshi |year=1980 |volume=76 |issue=5 |pages=355–61 |pmid=7203276 |doi=10.1254/fpj.76.355}}</ref> The increment in mucosal blood flow with troxipide is more pronounced in the gastric antrum than in the gastric corpus.<ref name="pmid7203276" />

=== Anti-''Helicobacter pylori'' action ===

Troxipide inhibits ''[[H. pylori]]''-derived urease, a multimeric nickel-containing enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of urea to yield ammonia and carbonic acid, which damage host tissues and trigger inflammatory response, including recruitment of [[leukocytes]] and triggering of the oxidative burst in [[neutrophils]].<ref name="pmid11515628" /><ref name="pmid8730260">{{cite journal |author=Mobley HL |title=The role of Helicobacter pylori urease in the pathogenesis of gastritis and peptic ulceration |journal=Aliment Pharmacol Ther |year=1996 |volume=10 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=57–64 |pmid=8730260 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2036.1996.22164006.x}}</ref>

== Pharmacokinetics ==

Troxipide is well absorbed throughout the gastrointestinal tract with a relative bioavailability of 99.6%.<ref name = "Zhao_2003">{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhao Y, Qiu R, Wang W, Sun H, Dai M, Yang Q, Mao G |date=June 2003 | title = Relative bioavailability and bioequivalance of troxipide capsule in healthy volunteers after a single oral administration | journal = The Chinese Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = | issue = | pages =  | url = http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-GLYZ200306013.htm  }}</ref> At any time, a mean concentration of 5.3- 8.9&nbsp;µg of troxipide is present per gram of tissue, which is capable of inhibiting the chemotactic migration and superoxide generation in the gastric mucosa.

== Clinical experience ==

Troxipide has been well established in the treatment of [[gastric ulcer]]s showing an overall amelioration rate of 79.4%.<ref name="Trox1" /> An overall endoscopic healing rate of 66.7% after 8 weeks and 80% after 12 weeks of drug administration was achieved with troxipide (100&nbsp;mg t.i.d. (three times a day)). In patients with [[duodenal ulcer]]s, troxipide showed endoscopic healing rate of 53.3% and 73% at 8 weeks and 12 weeks respectively. At the end of the treatment, an overall improvement of 86.6% and 93.3% was achieved in patients with gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer respectively.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hyeoyun | year = 1989 | title = Peptic ulcers for the clinical effectiveness of Troxipide | journal = Latest Med. | volume = 32 | issue = 2 | pages = 125–31 | url = }}</ref>
In patients with acute [[gastritis]] and acute gastric mucosal lesions, an overall amelioration rate of 82.9% has been observed with troxipide.<ref name="Trox1" /> In a comparative study evaluating the efficacy of troxipide (100&nbsp;mg t.i.d.) with [[Ranitidine]] (150&nbsp;mg b.i.d. (two times a day)), administered over 28 days in patients with gastritis, troxipide was statistically superior to Ranitidine, both with respect to resolution of gastritis clinical signs ([[abdominal pain]], [[bloating]], [[belching]] and [[heartburn]]) as well as the endoscopic evidences (erosion, oozing, redness and edema).<ref name="Trox2">{{cite journal |vauthors=Dewan B, Balasubramanian A | title = Troxipide in the management of gastritis: a randomized comparative trial in general practice | journal = Gastroenterol Res Pract | volume = 2010 | issue = | pages = 758397 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21127703 | pmc = 2992815 | doi = 10.1155/2010/758397 }}</ref> A study comparing the efficacy of troxipide (100&nbsp;mg t.i.d for 28 days) with [[Rabeprazole]] (20&nbsp;mg o.d. for 28 days) in patients suffering from gastritis showed that improvement in abdominal pain and [[nausea]] was significantly superior with troxipide at the end of 14 days. Troxipide administration caused a marked reduction in clinical (abdominal pain, bloating, belching, nausea, [[vomiting]], [[loss of appetite]] and heartburn) and endoscopic signs of gastritis by the end of the treatment, though it did not significantly differ from that of Rabeprazole.<ref>A Parallel, Randomized, Comparative, Double-Blind, Double-Dummy Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Troxipide versus Rabeprazole in the Treatment of Gastritis.

== Safety and tolerability ==

A post-marketing study, conducted by the innovator, in over 12,000 patients showed that only 0.75% of them developed adverse events attributable to the drug.<ref name="Trox1" /> The adverse reactions were mild to moderate, which resolved when the drug was discontinued. Commonly observed adverse events included constipation (0.19%) and increase in levels of liver enzymes, AST (0.17%) and ALT (0.25%). In a post-marketing study conducted in 1500 Indian patients, only 9 adverse events were reported in 9 patients (0.63%) that were of mild to moderate intensity.<ref name="Trox3" /> Adverse events observed included constipation, acidity, nausea, fatigue and headache, and were of mild to moderate intensity.<ref name="Trox3" />
In all clinical studies, troxipide was well tolerated. In a comparative study with [[ranitidine]], troxipide was assessed as a more tolerable medication than ranitidine. A favorable tolerability profile for troxipide was reported by 95.45% of the investigators as compared to 65.45% for ranitidine while favorable tolerability profile was reported by 93.67% of the patients for troxipide and 64.55% for ranitidine.<ref name="Trox2" />
