== Medical uses ==

===Local numbing agent===
The efficacy profile of lidocaine as a local anaesthetic is characterized by a rapid onset of action and intermediate duration of efficacy. Therefore, lidocaine is suitable for infiltration, block, and surface anaesthesia. Longer-acting substances such as [[bupivacaine]] are sometimes given preference for spinal and epidural anaesthesias; lidocaine, though, has the advantage of a rapid onset of action. [[Adrenaline]] vasoconstricts arteries, reducing bleeding and also delays the resorption of lidocaine, almost doubling the duration of anaesthesia. For surface anaesthesia, several formulations can be used for endoscopies, before intubations, etc. Buffering the [[pH]] of lidocaine makes local numbing less painful.<ref name="pmid21154371">{{cite journal |vauthors=Cepeda MS, Tzortzopoulou A, Thackrey M, Hudcova J, Arora Gandhi P, Schumann R | title = Adjusting the pH of lidocaine for reducing pain on injection | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = | issue = 12 | pages = CD006581 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21154371 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006581.pub2 }}</ref> Lidocaine drops can be used on the eyes for short ophthalmic procedures.

===Heart arrhythmia===
Lidocaine is also the most important [[Antiarrhythmic agent#Class I agents|class-1b antiarrhythmic drug]]; it is used intravenously for the treatment of [[ventricular arrhythmia]]s (for [[acute myocardial infarction]], [[digoxin]] poisoning, [[cardioversion]], or [[cardiac catheterization]]) if [[amiodarone]] is not available or contraindicated. Lidocaine should be given for this indication after defibrillation, CPR, and vasopressors have been initiated. A routine preventative dose is no longer recommended after a myocardial infarction as the overall benefit is not convincing.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Martí-Carvajal|first1=AJ|last2=Simancas-Racines|first2=D|last3=Anand|first3=V|last4=Bangdiwala|first4=S|title=Prophylactic lidocaine for myocardial infarction |journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=21 August 2015|volume=8|pages=CD008553|pmid=26295202|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008553.pub2}}</ref>

===Other===
Inhaled lidocaine can be used as a [[antitussive|cough suppressor]] acting peripherally to reduce the [[cough reflex]]. This application can be implemented as a safety and comfort measure for patients who have to be intubated, as it reduces the incidence of coughing and any tracheal damage it might cause when emerging from anaesthesia.<ref name="isbn0-7817-9595-8">{{cite book |veditors=Berger AM, Shuster JL, Von Roenn JH | title = Principles and practice of palliative care and supportive oncology | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | location = Hagerstwon, MD |year=2007 | isbn = 978-0-7817-9595-1 | author = Biller JA | chapter = Airway obstruction, bronchospasm, and cough | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=LngD6RFXY_AC&pg=PA297 | pages = 297–307 | quote = Inhaled lidocaine is used to suppress cough during bronchoscopy.

== Adverse effects ==
[[Adverse drug reaction]]s (ADRs) are rare when lidocaine is used as a local anesthetic and is administered correctly. Most ADRs associated with lidocaine for anesthesia relate to administration technique (resulting in systemic exposure) or pharmacological effects of anesthesia, and [[allergy|allergic]] reactions only rarely occur.<ref name="pmid7844301">{{cite journal |vauthors=Jackson D, Chen AH, Bennett CR | title = Identifying true lidocaine allergy | journal = J Am Dent Assoc | volume = 125 | issue = 10 | pages = 1362–6 | date = October 1994 | pmid = 7844301 | doi = }}</ref> Systemic exposure to excessive quantities of lidocaine mainly result in [[central nervous system]] (CNS) and [[cardiovascular]] effects – CNS effects usually occur at lower [[blood plasma]] concentrations and additional cardiovascular effects present at higher concentrations, though cardiovascular collapse may also occur with low concentrations. ADRs by system are:

*CNS excitation: nervousness, agitation, anxiety, apprehension, tingling around the mouth (circumoral paraesthesia), headache, [[hyperesthesia]], tremor, dizziness, pupillary changes, psychosis, euphoria, hallucinations, and seizures
*CNS depression with increasingly heavier exposure: drowsiness, lethargy, slurred speech, [[hypoesthesia]], confusion, disorientation, loss of consciousness, [[respiratory depression]] and [[apnoea]].
*Cardiovascular: [[hypotension]], [[bradycardia]], [[arrhythmia]]s, flushing, venous insufficiency, increased defibrillator threshold, [[edema]], and/or [[cardiac arrest]] – some of which may be due to [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxemia]] secondary to respiratory depression.<ref name="rossi">{{cite book | title = [[Australian Medicines Handbook]] | publisher = Australian Medicines Handbook Pty Ltd | location = Adelaide, S. Aust | year = 2006 | pages = | isbn = 0-9757919-2-3 }}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}</ref>
*Respiratory: bronchospasm, dyspnea, respiratory depression or arrest
*Gastrointestinal: metallic taste, nausea, vomiting
*Ears: [[tinnitus]]
*Eyes: local burning, conjunctival hyperemia, corneal epithelial changes/ulceration, diplopia, visual changes (opacification)
*Skin: itching, depigmentation, rash, [[urticaria]], edema, angioedema, bruising, [[thrombophlebitis|inflammation of the vein]] at the injection site, irritation of the skin when applied topically
*Blood: [[methemoglobinemia]]
*Allergy

ADRs associated with the use of intravenous lidocaine are similar to toxic effects from systemic exposure above. These are dose-related and more frequent at high infusion rates (≥3&nbsp;mg/min). Common ADRs include: headache, dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, visual disturbances, tinnitus, tremor, and/or [[paraesthesia]]. Infrequent ADRs associated with the use of lidocaine include: [[hypotension]], [[bradycardia]], [[arrhythmia]]s, [[cardiac arrest]], muscle twitching, [[seizure]]s, [[coma]], and/or respiratory depression.<ref name = rossi/>

It is generally safe to use lidocaine with vasoconstrictor such as epinephrine including in regions such as the [[nose]], ears, [[finger]]s and [[toes]].<ref name=Nie2014>{{cite journal|last1=Nielsen|first1=LJ|last2=Lumholt|first2=P|last3=Hölmich|first3=LR|title=[Local anaesthesia with vasoconstrictor is safe to use in areas with end-arteries in fingers, toes, noses and ears.]|journal=Ugeskrift for laeger|date=27 October 2014|volume=176|issue=44|pmid=25354008}}</ref> While concerns of tissue death if used in these areas have been raised evidence does not support these concerns.<ref name=Nie2014/>

=== Interactions ===
Any drugs that are also [[ligand]]s of [[CYP3A4]] and [[CYP1A2]] can potentially increase serum levels and potential for toxicity or decrease serum levels and the efficacy, depending on whether they induce or inhibit the enzymes, respectively. Drugs that may increase the chance of [[methemoglobinemia]] should also be considered carefully. [[Dronedarone]] and [[liposomal]] [[morphine]] are both absolutely [[contraindication|contraindicated]], as they may increase the serum levels, but hundreds of other drugs require monitoring for interaction.<ref name=epocrates>{{cite web|url=https://online.epocrates.com/u/104316/lidocaine/Drug+Interactions|title=Lidocaine|publisher=Epocrates|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422232823/https://online.epocrates.com/u/104316/lidocaine/Drug+Interactions|archivedate=2014-04-22|df=}}</ref>

* Impaired liver function - people with lowered hepatic function may have an adverse reaction with repeated administration of lidocaine because the drug is metabolized by the liver. Adverse reactions may include neurological symptoms (e.g. dizziness, nausea, muscle twitches, vomiting, or seizures).<ref name=Khan>{{cite book|last=Khan|first=M. Gabriel|title=Cardiac Drug Therapy|date=2007|publisher=Humana Press|location=Totowa, NJ|isbn=9781597452380|edition=7th}}</ref>

===Overdosage===
Overdoses with lidocaine can be a result of excessive administration by topical or parenteral routes, accidental oral ingestion of topical preparations by children who are more susceptible to overdose, accidental intravenous (rather than subcutaneous, intrathecal, or paracervical) injection, or prolonged use of subcutaneous infiltration anesthesia during cosmetic surgical procedures. These occurrences have often led to severe toxicity or death in both children and adults. Lidocaine and its two major metabolites may be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdose. It is important in the interpretation of analytical results to recognize that lidocaine is often routinely administered intravenously as an antiarrhythmic agent in critical cardiac-care situations.<ref name="isbn0-9626523-7-7">{{cite book | author = Baselt R | title = Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man | edition = 8th | publisher = Biomedical Publications | location = Foster City, CA | year = 2008 | pages = 840–4 | isbn = 0-9626523-7-7 }}</ref> Treatment with intravenous lipid emulsions (used for parental feeding) to reverse the effects of local anaesthetic toxicity is becoming more commonplace than it was in the past.<ref name="pmid19143686">{{cite journal |vauthors=Picard J, Ward SC, Zumpe R, Meek T, Barlow J, Harrop-Griffiths W | title = Guidelines and the adoption of 'lipid rescue' therapy for local anaesthetic toxicity | journal = Anaesthesia | volume = 64 | issue = 2 | pages = 122–5 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19143686 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2044.2008.05816.x }}</ref>

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
Lidocaine alters signal conduction in [[neuron]]s by blocking the fast [[sodium channel|voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels]] in the neuronal cell membrane responsible for signal propagation.<ref name="novartis">{{cite book |doi=10.1002/0470846682.ch14 |chapter=Molecular mechanisms of gating and drug block of sodium channels |title=Sodium Channels and Neuronal Hyperexcitability |series=Novartis Foundation Symposia |year=2001 |last1=Carterall |first1=William A. |isbn=9780470846681 |volume=241 |pages=206–225}}</ref> With sufficient blockage, the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron will not depolarize and will thus fail to transmit an [[action potential]]. This creates the [[anaesthetic]] effect by not merely preventing pain signals from propagating to the brain, but by stopping them before they begin. Careful titration allows for a high degree of selectivity in the blockage of sensory neurons, whereas higher concentrations also affect other modalities of neuron signaling.

The same principle applies for this drug's actions in the heart. Blocking sodium channels in the conduction system, as well as the muscle cells of the heart, raises the depolarization threshold, making the heart less likely to initiate or conduct early action potentials that may cause an arrhythmia.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sheu SS, Lederer WJ | title = Lidocaine's negative inotropic and antiarrhythmic actions.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
When used as an injectable it typically begins working within four minutes and lasts for half an hour to three hours.<ref name=AHFS2015L/><ref name=Wh1997/> Lidocaine is about 95% metabolized (dealkylated) in the [[liver]] mainly by CYP3A4 to the pharmacologically active [[Metabolomics#Metabolites|metabolites]] [[monoethylglycinexylidide]] (MEGX) and then subsequently to the inactive [[glycine xylidide]]. MEGX has a longer [[Biological half-life|half-life]] than lidocaine, but also is a less potent sodium channel blocker.<ref name="isbn0-07-143763-0">{{cite book |veditors=Flomenbaum N, Goldfrank LR, Hoffman RL, Howland MD, Lewin NA, Nelson LH | title = Goldfrank's Toxicologic Emergencies | edition = 8th | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | year = 2006 | pages = 963–4 |vauthors=Lewin NA, Nelson LH | chapter = Chapter 61: Antidysrhythmics | isbn = 0-07-143763-0 }}</ref> The [[volume of distribution]] is 1.1&nbsp;L/kg to 2.1&nbsp;L/kg, but congestive heart failure can decrease it. About 60% to 80% circulates bound to the protein alpha<sub>1</sub> acid glycoprotein. The oral bioavailability is 35% and the topical bioavailability is 3%.

The elimination half-life of lidocaine is biphasic and around 90&nbsp;min to 120&nbsp;min in most patients. This may be prolonged in patients with [[liver failure|hepatic impairment]] (average 343&nbsp;min) or [[heart failure|congestive heart failure]] (average 136&nbsp;min).<ref name="pmid4694036">{{cite journal |vauthors=Thomson PD, Melmon KL, Richardson JA, Cohn K, Steinbrunn W, Cudihee R, Rowland M | title = Lidocaine pharmacokinetics in advanced heart failure, liver disease, and renal failure in humans | journal = Ann.
