'''Sibutramine''', formerly sold under the brand name '''Meridia''' among others, is an [[appetite suppressant]] which has been discontinued in many countries. Until 2010, it was widely marketed and prescribed as an [[adjunct therapy|adjunct]] in the treatment of [[obesity]] along with [[dieting|diet]] and [[physical exercise|exercise]]. It has been associated with increased [[cardiovascular disease|cardiovascular event]]s and [[stroke]]s and has been [[withdrawn drug|withdrawn]] from the market in several countries and regions including

Sibutramine was originally developed in 1988 by [[Boots UK|Boots]] in [[Nottingham]], U.K.,<ref name="Buckett1988">{{cite journal|last1=Buckett|first1=W R|last2=Thomas|first2=P C|last3=Luscombe|first3=G P|title= The pharmacology of sibutramine hydrochloride (BTS 54 524), a new antidepressant which induces rapid noradrenergic down-regulation |journal= Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry |volume=12|issue=5|year=1988|pages=575–584|issn= 0278-5846  }}</ref> and marketed by Knoll Pharmaceuticals after BASF/Knoll AG purchased the Boots Research Division in 1995, and was most recently manufactured and marketed by [[Abbott Laboratories]] before its withdrawal from most markets. It has been sold under a variety of brand names including Reductil, Meridia, Siredia, and Sibutrex. It is classified as a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule IV drugs|Schedule IV]] [[controlled substance]] in the [[United States]].

==Medical uses==
Sibutramine has been used to produce appetite suppression for the purpose of attaining [[weight loss]] in the treatment of patients with obesity.

==Contraindications==
Sibutramine is contraindicated in patients with:

* Psychiatric conditions as [[bulimia nervosa]], [[anorexia nervosa]], serious [[clinical depression|depression]] or pre-existing [[mania]]
* Patients with a history of or a predisposition to drug or alcohol abuse
* [[Hypersensitivity]] to the drug or any of the inactive ingredients
* Patients below 18 and above 65 years of age<ref name="fda_August2010">[http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/ucm225956.htm The FDA August 2010 drug safety update]</ref>
* Concomitant treatment with a [[MAO inhibitor]], [[antidepressant]] or other [[Central nervous system|centrally]] active drugs, particularly other anoretics
* History of peripheral arterial disease
* [[Hypertension]] that is not sufficiently controlled (e.g., &gt;145/90 mmHg), caution in controlled hypertension
* Existing [[pulmonary hypertension]]
* Existing damage on heart valves, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, serious arrhythmias, previous myocardial infarction
* A history of coronary artery disease (e.g., angina, history of myocardial infarction), congestive heart failure, tachycardia, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, arrhythmia or cerebrovascular disease (stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA))<ref name="fda_August2010" />
* [[Stroke]] or [[transient ischemic attack]] (TIA)
* [[Hyperthyroidism]] (overactive thyroid gland)
* Closed angle [[glaucoma]]
* [[Seizure]] disorders
* Enlargement of the [[prostate]] gland with [[urinary retention]] (relative contraindication)
* [[Pheochromocytoma]]
* [[Pregnancy|Pregnant]] and [[breastfeeding|lactating]] women (relative contraindication)

==Side effects==
A higher number of [[cardiovascular events]] has been observed in people taking sibutramine versus control (11.4% vs. 10.0%).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/DrugSafetyInformationforHeathcareProfessionals/ucm191650.htm |title=Early Communication about an Ongoing Safety Review ofÂ Meridia (sibutramine hydrochloride) |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>  In 2010 the FDA noted the concerns that sibutramine increases the risk of [[heart attacks]] and [[strokes]] in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm198221.htm |title=Meridia (sibutramine hydrochloride): Follow-Up to an Early Communication about an Ongoing Safety Review |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Frequently encountered [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]]s are: dry mouth, paradoxically increased appetite, [[nausea]], [[dysgeusia|strange taste in the mouth]], upset stomach, constipation, trouble sleeping, dizziness, drowsiness, menstrual cramps/pain, headache, flushing, or joint/muscle pain.

Sibutramine can substantially increase [[blood pressure]] and heart rate in some patients.<ref>Siebenhofer A, Jeitler K, Horvath K, Berghold A, Siering U, Semlitsch T. Long-term effects of weight-reducing drugs in hypertensive patients. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2013, Issue 3. Art. No.: CD007654. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD007654.pub3.</ref> Therefore, regular monitoring needs to be performed.

The following side effects are infrequent but serious and require immediate medical attention: [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s, [[paresthesia]], mental/mood changes (e.g., excitement, restlessness, confusion, depression, rare thoughts of [[suicide]]).

Symptoms that require urgent medical attention are [[seizure]]s, problems urinating, abnormal bruising or bleeding, [[melena]], [[hematemesis]], [[jaundice]], [[fever]] and [[rigor (medicine)|rigor]]s, [[chest pain]], [[hemiplegia]], abnormal vision, [[dyspnea]] and [[edema]].

Currently, no case of [[pulmonary hypertension]] has been noted.  (Fenfluramine, of the 1990s "Fen-Phen" combo, forced excess release of neurotransmitters—a different action. Phentermine was uninvolved in the rare—but clinically significant—heart issues of fenfluramine.)

==Interactions==
Sibutramine has a number of clinically significant interactions. The concomitant use of sibutramine and [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAOIs, such as [[selegiline]]) is not indicated, as it may increase the risk of [[serotonin syndrome]], a somewhat rare but serious [[adverse drug reaction]].<ref name="RxList">{{cite web |url=http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/sibutramine_ad.htm |title = Meridia Side Effects, and Drug Interactions |year = 2007 |accessdate = 2007-04-29 |publisher = RxList.com}}</ref> Sibutramine should not be taken within two weeks of stopping or starting an MAOI. Taking both sibutramine and certain medications used in the treatment of [[migraine]]s—such as [[ergoline]]s and [[triptan]]s—as well as [[opioid]]s, may also increase the risk for serotonin syndrome, as may the use of more than one serotonin reuptake inhibitor at the same time.<ref name="RxList"/>

The concomitant use of sibutramine and drugs which inhibit [[CYP3A4]], such as [[ketoconazole]] and [[erythromycin]], may increase plasma levels of sibutramine.<ref>{{pt icon}} Cloridrato de sibutramina monoidratado.

Sibutramine is a [[monoamine reuptake inhibitor]] (MRI) that, in humans, reduces the [[reuptake]] of [[norepinephrine]] (by ~73%), [[serotonin]] (by ~54%), and [[dopamine]] (by ~16%),<ref name = "PI">{{cite web|title=Meridia (sibutramine hydrochloride monohydrate) Capsules CIV.

Older [[anorectic]] agents such as [[amphetamine]] and [[fenfluramine]] force the release of these neurotransmitters rather than affecting their reuptake.<ref name="Heal">{{Cite journal|last2=Aspley|first2=S.|last3=Prow|first3=M.

J.}}</ref>

Despite having a mechanism of action similar to [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s, sibutramine has failed to demonstrate [[antidepressant]] properties in animal studies. It was approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in November 1997<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/ANS00835.html |title = FDA APPROVES SIBUTRAMINE TO TREAT OBESITY |date = November 24, 1997 |publisher = U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] |accessdate = 2007-04-29}}</ref> for the treatment of obesity.

Sibutramine is reported to be a [[prodrug]] to two [[active metabolite]]s, [[desmethylsibutramine]] (M1; BTS-54354) and [[didesmethylsibutramine]] (M2; BTS-54505), with much greater potency as MRIs.<ref name="KimSong2009">{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=K A|last2=Song|first2=W K|last3=Park|first3=J Y|title=Association of CYP2B6, CYP3A5, and CYP2C19 Genetic Polymorphisms With Sibutramine Pharmacokinetics in Healthy Korean Subjects|journal=Clinical Pharmacology &#38; Therapeutics|volume=86|issue=5|year=2009|pages=511–518|issn=0009-9236|doi=10.1038/clpt.2009.145}}</ref><ref name="Hofbauer2004">{{cite book | last=Hofbauer | first=Karl | title=Pharmacotherapy of obesity : options and alternatives | publisher=CRC Press | location=Boca Raton, Fla | year=2004 | isbn=0-415-30321-4 | page=}}</ref>

Unlike other serotonergic appetite suppressants like [[fenfluramine]], sibutramine and its metabolites have only low and likely inconsequential [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for the [[5-HT2C receptor|5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor]].<ref name = "PI" />

===Pharmacokinetics===
Sibutramine is well absorbed from the [[gastrointestinal tract]] (77%), but undergoes considerable [[first-pass metabolism]], reducing its bioavailability. The drug itself reaches its peak [[blood plasma|plasma]] level after 1 hour and has also a half-life of 1 hour. Sibutramine is metabolized by [[Cytochrome P450 oxidase|cytochrome P450]] [[isozyme]] [[CYP3A4]] into two pharmacologically-active primary and secondary [[amine]]s (called active metabolites 1 and 2) with half-lives of 14 and 16 hours, respectively. Peak plasma concentrations of active metabolites 1 and 2 are reached after three to four hours. The following metabolic pathway mainly results in two inactive conjugated and hydroxylated metabolites (called metabolites 5 and 6). Metabolites 5 and 6 are mainly excreted in the urine.

==Chemistry==
Sibutramine has usually been used in the form of the [[hydrochloride]] [[monohydrate]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]].

====Detection in body fluids====
Sibutramine and its two active ''N''-demethylated metabolites may be measured in [[biofluid]]s by [[liquid chromatography]]-[[mass spectrometry]]. Plasma levels of these three species are usually in the 1–10 ''μ''g/L range in persons undergoing therapy with the drug. The parent compound and norsibutramine are often not detectable in urine, but dinorsibutramine is generally present at concentrations of >200 ''μ''g/L.<ref>Jain DS, Subbaiah G, Sanyal M, et al.

===Regulatory approval===
Studies are ongoing into reports of sudden death, [[heart failure]], [[renal failure]] and gastrointestinal problems.

Between January 2003 and November 2005, a large randomized-controlled "Sibutramine Cardiovascular OUTcomes" (SCOUT) study with 10,742 patients examined whether or not sibutramine administered within a weight management program reduces the risk for cardiovascular complications in people at high risk for heart disease and concluded that use of silbutramine had a RR 1.16 for the primary outcome (composit of nonfatal MI, nonfatal CVA, cardiac arrest, and CV death).<ref>Effect of sibutramine on cardiovascular outcomes in overweight and obese subjects. [http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1003114 N Engl J Med 2010; 363:905-917 September 2, 2010] DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1003114 
</ref>

In a dissenting article, "Sibutramine: gone, but not forgotten", [[David Haslam (GP)|David Haslam]] (chairman of the [[National Obesity Forum]]) says that the SCOUT study is flawed as it only covered high-risk patients and did not consider obese patients who do not have cardiovascular complications or similar contraindications <ref>http://www.practicaldiabetesinternational.com/SpringboardWebApp/userfiles/espdi/file/Ldr%20Haslam_Layout%201.pdf</ref>

On January 21, 2010, the [[European Medicines Agency]] recommended suspension of marketing authorizations for sibutramine based on the SCOUT study results.<ref>[http://www.ema.europa.eu/pdfs/human/referral/sibutramine/3940810en.pdf Press Release], European Medicines Agency, January 21, 2010</ref>

In August 2010 the FDA added a new contraindication for patients over 65 years of age due to the fact that clinical studies of sibutramine did not include sufficient numbers of such patients.<ref name="fda_August2010" />

[[Abbott Laboratories]] announced on October 8, 2010 that it is withdrawing sibutramine from the US market under pressure from the FDA, citing concerns over minimal efficacy coupled with increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/09/health/09drug.html?ref=business | work=The New York Times | first=Andrew | last=Pollack | title=Abbott Labs Withdraws Meridia From Market | date=October 8, 2010}}</ref>

===Counterfeit weight-loss products===
On December 22, 2008, the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] issued an alert to consumers naming 27 different products marketed as “[[dietary supplement]]s” for weight loss, that illegally contain undisclosed amounts of sibutramine.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2008/NEW01933.html |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |title=FDA warns consumers about tainted weight loss pills |date=22 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/consumerinfo/weight_loss_products.htm |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research |title=Consumer directed questions and answers about FDA’s initiative against contaminated weight loss products |date=22 December 2008}}</ref> In March 2009, Dieter Müller ''et al.'' published a study of sibutramine poisoning cases from similar Chinese "[[herbal supplement]]s" sold in Europe, containing as much as twice the dosage of the legally licensed drug.<ref>{{Cite journal| last1 = Müller | first1 = D.| last2 = Weinmann | first2 = W.| last3 = Hermanns-Clausen | first3 = M.| title = Chinese slimming capsules containing sibutramine sold over the Internet: a case series| journal = Deutsches Arzteblatt international| volume = 106| issue = 13| pages = 218–222| year = 2009| pmid = 19471631| doi = 10.3238/arztebl.2009.0218| pmc = 2680571}}</ref>

An additional 34 products were recalled by the FDA on April 22, 2009, further underscoring the risks associated with unregulated "herbal supplements" to unsuspecting persons. This concern is especially relevant to those with underlying medical conditions incompatible with undeclared pharmaceutical adulterants.<ref>[http://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20090422/34-weight-loss-products-recalled 34 weight loss products recalled], [[WebMD]], 22 April 2009.</ref> In January 2010, a similar alert was issued for counterfeit versions of the [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] weight loss drug Alli sold over the Internet. Instead of the active ingredient [[orlistat]], the counterfeit drugs contain sibutramine, and at concentrations at least twice the amount recommended for weight loss.<ref>{{cite news |publisher= [[CNN.com]] |url= http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/01/23/fake.diet.drug/index.html |title= Fake Alli diet pills can pose health risks |accessdate= 2010-01-24 |date=January 23, 2010}}</ref>

In March 2010 [[Health Canada]] advised the public that illegal "Herbal Diet Natural" had been found on the market, containing sibutramine, which is a prescription drug in Canada, without listing sibutramine as an ingredient.<ref>{{cite news | title=Herbal diet product poses heart risk | date=March 26, 2010 | publisher=CBC News | url=http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2010/03/26/herbal-dietnatural.html }}</ref> In October 2010 FDA notified consumers that "Slimming Beauty Bitter Orange Slimming Capsules contain the active pharmaceutical ingredient sibutramine, a prescription-only drug which is a stimulant.

In October 2010 the [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency|MHRA]] in the UK issued a warning regarding "Payouji tea" and "Pai You Guo Slim Capsules" which were found to contain undeclared quantities of sibutramine.<ref>http://www.mhra.gov.uk/NewsCentre/Pressreleases/CON096957</ref>

On December 30, 2010 the FDA released a warning regarding "Fruta Planta" dietary products, which were found to contain undeclared amounts of sibutramine.
