'''Benzoctamine''' is a [[drug]] that possesses [[sedative]] and [[anxiolytic]] properties. Marketed as '''Tacitin''' by [[Ciba-Geigy]], it is different from most sedative drugs because in most [[clinical trial]]s it does not produce [[respiratory depression]], but actually stimulates the [[respiratory system]]. As a result, when compared to other sedative and anxiolytic drugs such as [[benzodiazepine]]s like [[diazepam]], it is a safer form of [[tranquilizer|tranquilizing]]. However, when co-administered with other drugs that cause respiratory depression, like [[morphine]], it can cause increased respiratory depression.

Medically, benzoctamine is used as a treatment for anxious outpatients to control aggression, [[enuresis]], fear, and minor social maladjustment in children. While it is a relatively new [[anti-anxiety]] drug, its popularity is increasing as a result of it being able to have comparable anxiolytic and sedative effects to other medications without their potentially fatal respiratory depressive side effects. Its anxiolytic effects are most similar to [[diazepam]], another anxiolytic, but unlike diazepam, benzoctamine has antagonistic effects on [[epinephrine]], [[norepinephrine]], and appears to reduce [[serotonin]] turnover. While little is understood about how it carries out its effects, studies point to reduced serotonin, epinephrine, and norepinephrine as partial causes of its [[pharmacologic]] and behavioral effects.<ref name="pmid4480288">{{cite journal |author=Lippmann W, Pugsley TA |title=Effects of benzoctamine and chlordiazepoxide on turnover and uptake of 5-hydroxytryptamine in the brain |journal=Br. J. Pharmacol. |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=571–5 |date=August 1974 |pmid=4480288 |pmc=1778070 |doi= 10.1111/j.1476-5381.1974.tb09676.x|url=|last2=Pugsley }}</ref>

Animal studies have shown sedative hypnotic drugs tend to show dependency in animals, but benzoctamine has been shown to not be addictive. Other animal studies also point to the drug as a possible mechanism by which to reduce blood pressure through the [[adrenergic]] system.

Chemically, benzoctamine belongs to the class of compounds called dibenzobicyclo-octodienes. It is a [[heterocyclic compound|tetracyclic compound]], consisting of four rings in a three dimensional configuration, and is very closely related structurally to the [[tetracyclic antidepressant]] (TeCA) [[maprotiline]], differing only in the length of their [[side chain]].

==Medical uses==

===Anxiety===
Benzoctamine’s main clinical use is for the treatment of [[anxiety]], and evidence points to it being as effective as other clinical anxiety drugs, in particular diazepam.<ref name="controlled">{{cite journal|title=Controlled comparative studies with Benzoctamine and Diazepam}}</ref> In the treatment of symptoms of mild anxiety due to [[psychoneurosis]], a daily dosage of 30 to 80 g of benzoctamine was shown to be just as effective as 6–20&nbsp;mg of diazepam.<ref name=controlled /> In another study one group of patients were given 10g of benzoctamine three times a day, while another group was given 5&nbsp;mg of diazepam, and the treatments were equivalent.<ref name="comparative">{{cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=BJ|author2=Weer, DM|title=Comparative evaluation of benzoctamine and diazepam in treatment of anxiety.|journal=The Journal of clinical pharmacology and the journal of new drugs|date=May–Jun 1970|volume=10|issue=3|pages=194–8|pmid=4392683}}</ref> While these studies point to higher doses of benzoctamine being needed to exert the same pharmacological effects, the drug is still popular because of its ability to act as an anxiolytic without producing the common respiratory depression associated with other sedative drugs. Some studies have even shown that it stimulates the respiratory system.<ref name="human mice">{{cite journal|last=Utting|first=HJ|author2=Pleuvry, BJ|title=Benzoctamine-a study of the respiratory effects of oral doses in human volunteers and interactions with morphine in mice.|journal=British journal of anaesthesia|date=Sep 1975|volume=47|issue=9|pages=987–92|pmid=1103919|doi=10.1093/bja/47.9.987}}</ref>

====Benzoctamine and sodium amylobarbitone====
In a study used to compare benzoctamine to [[amylobarbitone|sodium amylobarbitone]] as a sleep promoter, it was found that during administration of both drugs, patients reported that their sleep was less restless, and drowsiness was diminished.<ref name="Ogunremi">{{cite journal|last=Ogunremi|first=OO|author2=Adamson, L |author3=Brezinová, V |author4=Hunter, WM |author5=Maclean, AW |author6=Oswald, I |author7= Percy-Robb, IW |title=Two anti-anxiety drugs: a psychoneuroendocrine study.|journal=British Medical Journal|date=Apr 28, 1973|volume=2|issue=5860|pages=202–5|pmid=4349414 |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.5860.202 |pmc=1589389}}</ref> The study further showed that while sodium amylobarbitone caused withdrawal rebound symptoms, benzoctamine did not.<ref name=Ogunremi /> It was also found that benzoctamine reduced plasma corticosteroid hormone levels.<ref name=Ogunremi /> There is a relationship between anxiety and adreno-corticosteroid activity, with raised levels commonly being reported as an indication of stress.<ref name=Ogunremi /> The study showed that benzoctamine, a drug reported to reduce anxiety, was also able to reduce the hormones that potentially cause it.<ref name=Ogunremi /> This points to a phenomenon often seen within pharmacology where drugs intended for other uses often have far-reaching and rarely considered effects.

====Benzoctamine vs. chlordiazepoxide in anxiety neurosis====
Benzoctamine has been found to have the same efficacy as chlordiazepoxide when treating anxiety neurosis<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lo|first=WH|author2=Lo, T|title=Clinical trial of benzoctamine versus chlordiazepoxide in anxiety neurosis.|journal=The Journal of clinical pharmacology and new drugs|date=Jan 1973|volume=13|issue=1|pages=48–53|pmid=4566124|doi=10.1002/j.1552-4604.1973.tb00069.x}}</ref>

===Sleep sedation===
While benzoctamine was made to be an alternative to the [[benzodiazepine]] line of anxiolytic drugs, other uses for the drug have been discovered. Due to benzoctamine's ability to [[tranquilize]] without causing respiratory depression, scientists are moving forward with studies that test its sedative effects in patients with respiratory failure. In one study that used benzoctamine in a clinical setting, researchers showed that the use of benzoctamine for sedation did not result in changes in [[forced expiratory volume in one second]] or [[carbon dioxide partial pressure]] PCO<sub>2</sub>.<ref name="sedation">{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=TJ|author2=Collins, JV|title=Use of benzoctamine as sedative in patients with respiratory failure.|journal=British Medical Journal|date=Jan 13, 1973|volume=1|issue=5845|pages=75–6|pmid=20791872|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.5845.75|pmc=1588741}}</ref> This confirmed previous statements that claimed the drug did not cause respiratory failure. The main goal of this clinical study was to confirm the findings of another study that showed benzoctamine did not reduce CO<sub>2</sub> responsiveness, but instead increased the ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub>.<ref name="respiratory stimulation">{{cite journal|last=Geisler|first=L|author2=Rost, H|title=Proceedings of International Symposium on Anxiety and Tension-New Therapeutic Aspects|journal=St. Moritz|year=1970|pages=57}}</ref>

There are usually many risks associated with using sedatives on patients who are suffering from respiratory failure, which has made it difficult to administer tranquillizing medications in situations when they are desirable. It is not known why this drug is safe and its benzodiazepine cousins are not, but a possible explanation for this phenomenon might come from its similarity in structure to [[tricyclic antidepressants]], which have also been shown to not cause respiratory failure.<ref name=sedation /> While further experimentation is necessary, this study points to benzoctamine’s possible consideration for sedation in respiratory failure patients.

===Other uses===

====Hypertension ====
A possible treatment for [[hypertension]] is blocking peripheral vascular seretonergic neurons or alpha-[[adrenergic]] neurons on [[postsynaptic cell]] sites.<ref name="hypertension">{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=ML|author2=Fuller, RW |author3=Kurz, KD |title=Evidence that blood pressure reduction by serotonin antagonists is related to alpha receptor blockade in spontaneously hypertensive rats.|journal=Hypertension|date=Sep–Oct 1983|volume=5|issue=5|pages=676–81|pmid=6311738|doi=10.1161/01.hyp.5.5.676}}</ref> One study showed that benzoctamine, a serotonin and alpha-adrenergic [[antagonist]], does not reduce blood pressure through a seretonin mechanism but does reduce [[blood pressure]] by antagonizing alpha-[[adrenergic receptors]] in rats.<ref name=hypertension /> Rats were given 10&nbsp;mg of benzoctamine and drops in their blood pressure were approximately 30&nbsp;mm Hg.<ref name=hypertension /> The researchers further confirmed that [[Serotonin antagonist|serotonin antagonism]] was not sufficient to reduce blood pressure by using the highly selective serotonin antagonist 1-(1-naphthyl)-piperazine, which was not able to decrease the blood pressure of the rats.<ref name=hypertension /> These studies have yet to be repeated in humans.

==Side effects==

===Common side effects===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}

• Drowsiness
• Dry mouth
• Headache
• Dizziness

===Serotonin turnover===
Studies have shown that benzoctamine decreases the rate of turnover of serotonin.<ref name=hypertension /> Scientists confirmed these results and proposed that the method of action was inhibition of serotonin uptake since the drug also blocked the serotonin depleting action of extra-neuronal monoamine transporters (EMT).<ref name="serotonin turnover">{{cite journal|last=Lippmann|first=W|author2=Pugsley, TA|title=Effects of benzoctamine and chlordiazepoxide on turnover and uptake of 5-hydroxytryptamine in the brain.|journal=British Journal of Pharmacology|date=Aug 1974|volume=51|issue=4|pages=571–5|pmid=4480288|doi=10.1111/j.1476-5381.1974.tb09676.x|pmc=1778070}}</ref> This would lead to increased stimulation of serotonin receptors through a [[Negative feedback|negative feed back]] mechanism, eventually decreasing serotonin out put. However, the study points out that other studies have shown that drugs combined with EMT cause a lowering of body temperature that in fact results in a decrease in 5HT turnover.<ref name="serotonin turnover" /> This means that body temperature effects cannot be ruled out.

==Pharmacology==
Not much is understood about how benzoctamine produces its anti-anxiety effects, but rat studies have shown that the possible mechanism of action is by way of increased turnover of cathecholamines.<ref name="cathe">{{cite journal|last=Maître|first=L|author2=Staehelin, M |author3=Bein, HJ |title=Effects of benzoctamine (30803-Ba, TACITIN), a new psychoactive drug, on catecholamine metabolism.|journal=Biochemical Pharmacology|date=Nov 1970|volume=19|issue=11|pages=2875–92|pmid=5512696|doi=10.1016/0006-2952(70)90027-4}}</ref> In addition to serotonin it has also been shown to decrease epinephrine, [[dopamine]], and norepinephrine turnover by antagonizing their receptors.<ref name="serotonin turnover" /> When given intravenously in doses of 20–40&nbsp;mg there are no significant differences in efficacy.<ref name="prelim report" /> Oral doses exceeding 10&nbsp;mg three times daily do not increase the effects of the drug.<ref name=comparative /> Assuming serotonin postsynaptic antagonism is the main mechanism by which benzoctamine carries out its effects, studies have shown it to have a [[half maximal inhibitory concentration]]([[IC50]]) value of 115 mM at the serotonin receptor.<ref name="ic50">{{cite journal|last=Suzuki-Nishimura|first=T|author2=Sano, T |author3=Uchida, MK |title=Effects of benzodiazepines on serotonin release from rat mast cells.|journal=European Journal of Pharmacology|date=Aug 11, 1989|volume=167|issue=1|pages=75–85|pmid=2550260|doi=10.1016/0014-2999(89)90749-8}}</ref>

==Pharmacokinetics==
Benzoctamine can be injected directly into the blood or given as tablets. When given as tablets, it is given in doses of 10&nbsp;mg three times daily.<ref name=comparative /> And when given intravenously, patients are given the drug at a rate of 5&nbsp;mg/minute until 20–40&nbsp;mg of drug has been injected.<ref name="prelim report">{{cite journal|last=Goodwin|first=NM|author2=Brock-Utne, JG |author3=Downing, JW |author4= Coleman, AJ |title=Benzoctamine. A preliminary report on a new sedative drug.|journal=Anaesthesia|date=Nov 1974|volume=29|issue=6|pages=715–20|pmid=4479725 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2044.1974.tb00758.x}}</ref> Benzoctamine can be analyzed as the <sup>3</sup>H acetyl derivative and N-methyl [[metabolite]] it gets broken down into using radioactive analysis.<ref name="poisoned">{{cite journal|last=Flanagan|first=RJ|title=The poisoned patient: the role of the laboratory.|journal=British journal of biomedical science|date=Sep 1995|volume=52|issue=3|pages=202–13|pmid=8527998}}</ref> Benzoctamine has a half-life of 2–3 hours,<ref name="human mice" /> with a [[bioavailability]] of 100% when given intravenously and around > 90% when given orally.<ref>{{cite book|vauthors = Rang HP,Dale MM, Ritter JM, Moore PK|title=Pharmacology|year=2003|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Edinburgh [u.a.]|isbn=0-443-07145-4|page=103|edition=5.}}</ref> The average time to achieve peak plasma concentrations is 1 hour<ref name="human mice" /> and the [[volume of distribution]] for a 70&nbsp;kg person is 1-2 l/kg.<ref name="human mice" />

==Other studies==

===Alcohol and benzoctamine===
Benzoctamine, like other [[psychoactive]] drugs has the ability to potentiate the effects of other drugs.<ref name="alcohol">{{cite journal|last=Landauer|first=AA|author2=Laurie, W |author3=Milner, G |title=The effect of benzoctamine and alcohol on motor-skills used in car driving.|journal=Forensic Science|date=Aug 1973|volume=2|issue=3|pages=275–83|pmid=4740704|doi=10.1016/0300-9432(73)90042-3}}</ref> However, a motor skill study looking at benzoctamine's capacity to potentiate the inhibitory effects of alcohol showed no significant decreases in [[motor skill]] function due to benzoctamine being administered with alcohol.<ref name=alcohol />

===Morphine and benzoctamine===
Though benzoctamine does not potentiate the effects of alcohol, studies have shown it can potentiate the respiratory depression seen with [[morphine]] in rats, while also reducing morphine's [[analgesic]] effects.<ref name="human mice" />

===Dependency===
Monkey studies looking at the dependence liability of several sedative drugs showed that benzoctamine was a dependence-free drug, while [[pentobarbital]], alcohol, [[chloroform]], [[meprobamate]], [[diazepam]], [[chlordiazepoxide]], and [[oxazolam]] were not.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Yanagita|first=T|author2=Takahashi, S|title=Dependence liability of several sedative-hypnotic agents evaluated in monkeys.|journal=The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics|date=May 1973|volume=185|issue=2|pages=307–16|pmid=4634092}}</ref>

===Benzoctamine vs. chlordiazepoxide in serotonin turnover===
In a rat study looking at the effects of benzoctamine and chlordiazepoxide on serotonin turnover, rats treated with drug were found to have elevated levels of [<sup>14</sup>C]-5HT, indicating a decrease in serotonin turnover.<ref name=pmid4480288 />
