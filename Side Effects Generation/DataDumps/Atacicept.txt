'''Atacicept''' is a [[recombinant fusion protein]] designed to inhibit [[B cell]]s, thereby suppressing [[autoimmune disease]]. The designer protein combines the binding site for two [[cytokine]]s that regulate maturation, function, and survival of B cells - [[B-lymphocyte stimulator]] (BLyS) and [[A proliferation-inducing ligand]] (APRIL), with the constant region of [[immunoglobin]].<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=21179612 |title=Atacicept: targeting B cells in multiple sclerosis |author=Hartung HP | doi=10.1177/1756285610371146 |volume=3 |issue=4 |pmc=3002656 |date=July 2010 |journal=Ther Adv Neurol Disord |pages=205â€“16|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Atacicept blocks activation of B cells by the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 13B (more commonly known as [[TACI]]), a transmembrane receptor protein found predominantly on the surface of B cells. Like the [[monoclonal antibody]] [[belimumab]], atacicept blocks the binding of BLyS, but it also blocks APRIL. Binding of these TACI ligands induces proliferation, activation, and longevity of B cells and thus their production of [[autoantibodies]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wellsphere.com/multiple-sclerosis-ms-article/merck-serono-and-zymogenetics-initiate-atacicept-phase-2-clinical-trial-in-relapsing-multiple-sclerosis/562995 |title=Merck Serono and ZymoGenetics Initiate Atacicept Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823135133/http://www.wellsphere.com/multiple-sclerosis-ms-article/merck-serono-and-zymogenetics-initiate-atacicept-phase-2-clinical-trial-in-relapsing-multiple-sclerosis/562995 |archivedate=2010-08-23 |df= }}</ref> Atacicept is thought to selectively impair mature B cells and plasma cells with less impact on [[progenitor cell]]s and [[memory B cell]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jcp.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/48/4/406 |title=Pharmacokinetics and Biological Activity of Atacicept in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis |author=Nestorov|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

The drug is also being studied for treatment of B-cell malignancies, including [[multiple myeloma]], [[B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia]], and [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]].<ref name="DOTF" />

Atacicept was developed by a Seattle-based biotech company, ZymoGenetics, which handed the product over to Merck Serono for further development.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2008/09/03/zymogenetics-hands-over-atacicept-rights-to-partner-merck-kgaa/ |title= ZymoGenetics Hands Over Atacicept Rights to Partner, Merck KGaA.
