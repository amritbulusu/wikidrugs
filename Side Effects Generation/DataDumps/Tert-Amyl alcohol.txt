'''''tert''-Amyl alcohol''' ('''TAA'''), systematic name: '''2-methylbutan-2-ol''' ('''2M2B'''), is a branched [[pentanol]] used primarily as a pharmaceutical or pigment solvent. It remains liquid at room temperature making it a useful alternative to [[tert-butyl alcohol|''tert''-butyl alcohol]]. It is a colorless liquid with a pungent odor of [[camphor]]. It is slightly soluble in water and [[Miscibility|miscibile]] organic solvents. Although it can be produced naturally, by the fermentation of [[ethanol]], it is primarily produced synthetically via [[hydroformylation]].

==Production==

===Industrial===
Like other [[oxo alcohol]]s TAA is primarily produced via [[hydroformylation]]. The reaction of [[2-methyl-2-butene]] with water in the presence of an acid catalyst yields TAA.<ref name="toxnet">Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. 4th ed. Volumes 1: New York, NY.

===Natural occurrence===
[[Fusel alcohol]]s including TAA are grain fermentation by-products and therefore trace amounts of TAA are present in many alcoholic beverages.<ref name="GouldScott1919">{{cite book|author1=George Milbry Gould|authorlink1=George M.

==Pharmacology==
Between about 1880 and 1950, it was used as an anesthetic, with the contemporary name of '''amylene hydrate'''. It was mainly used as a solvent for [[tribromoethanol]], forming "avertin fluid" at a 0.5 : 1 ratio of TAA to TBE. TAA was rarely used as a sole hypnotic because of the existence of more efficient drugs.<ref name= adriani/>

Tertiary alcohols like TAA cannot be oxidised to aldehyde or carboxylic acid metabolites, which are often toxic; this makes them safer drugs than primary alcohols.<ref name='tert alcohol'>{{cite book | last1 = Carey | first1 = Francis | title = Organic Chemistry | edition = 4 | url = http://www.mhhe.com/physsci/chemistry/carey/student/olc/ch15oxidationalcohols.html | accessdate = 2013-02-05 | isbn = 0072905018}}</ref> However, like other tertiary alcohol based anaesthetics (e.g. [[methylpentynol]], [[ethchlorvynol]]) TAA was eventually superseded by safer and more effective agents.

TAA produces [[euphoria]], [[sedative]], [[hypnotic]], and [[anticonvulsant]] effects similar to [[ethanol]] through ingestion or inhalation.<ref>{{ cite book | author = Robert A.

In rats, TAA is primarily [[Drug metabolism|metabolized]] via [[glucuronidation]], as well as by oxidation to 2-methyl-2,3-butanediol. It is likely that the same path is followed in humans,<ref name="pmid10367338">{{Cite journal

== Overdose and toxicity ==
An overdose produces symptoms similar to [[alcohol poisoning]] and is a medical emergency due to the sedative/depressant properties which manifest in overdose as potentially lethal [[respiratory depression]]. The oral {{LD50}} in rats is 1000&nbsp;mg/kg. The [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous]] LD<sub>50</sub> in mice is 2100&nbsp;mg/kg.<ref>{{Cite journal
