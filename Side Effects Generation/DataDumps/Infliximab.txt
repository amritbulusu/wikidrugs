'''Infliximab''' (trade names '''Remicade''' among others) is a [[chimeric protein|chimeric]] [[monoclonal antibody]] [[Biopharmaceutical|biologic]] drug that works against tumor necrosis factor alpha ([[TNF alpha|TNF-α]]) and is used to treat [[autoimmune]] [[List of autoimmune diseases|diseases]]. Infliximab was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for the treatment of [[Crohn's disease]], [[ulcerative colitis]], [[psoriasis]], [[psoriatic arthritis]], [[ankylosing spondylitis]], and [[rheumatoid arthritis]].<ref>[Official Website for REMICADE® (infliximab) http://www.remicade.com/]</ref> It is used off-label outside its FDA approval for [[Behçet's disease]] and other conditions. Infliximab is administered by [[intravenous therapy|intravenous infusion]], typically at six- to eight-week intervals. It cannot be given [[route of administration|by mouth]] because the [[digestive system]] would destroy the drug.<ref>{{cite book|last=Steinhilber|first=D|author2=Schubert-Zsilavecz, M |author3=Roth, HJ |title=Medizinische Chemie|publisher=Deutscher Apothekerverlag|location=Stuttgart|year=2005|edition=1|page=5|chapter=Molekülstruktur und biologische Eigenschaften|isbn=3-7692-3483-9|language=German}}</ref>

Infliximab works by binding to TNF-α. TNF-α is a chemical messenger ([[cytokine]]) and a key part of the autoimmune reaction. In rheumatoid arthritis, infliximab seems to work by preventing TNF-α from binding to its [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] in the cell.

Infliximab is an artificial [[antibody]]. It was originally developed in mice as a mouse antibody. Because humans have immune reactions to mouse proteins, the mouse common domains were replaced with similar human antibody domains. They are [[monoclonal antibody|monoclonal antibodies]] and have identical structures and affinities to the target. Because they are a combination of mouse and human antibody amino acid sequences, they are called a "chimeric monoclonal antibody". In the United States, Remicade/infliximab can cost $19,000 to $22,000 a year per patient, according to Centocor in 2007.<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/05/08/BUGHAPMN021.DTL "Priced out of pain relief; Insurers balk at high costs of promising new treatments"], Victoria Colliver, ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', May 8, 2007</ref>

Infliximab [[biosimilar]]s have been approved in the EU (2013), Japan (2014), and USA (2016).

==Medical uses==

===Crohn's disease===
Three [[phenotype]]s, or categories of disease, are present in [[Crohn's disease]]: stricturing disease (which causes narrowing of the bowel), penetrating disease (which causes [[fistula]]e or abnormal connections of the bowel), and inflammatory disease (which primarily causes [[inflammation]]).<!--

====Fistulizing disease====
Infliximab was first used for closure of fistulae in Crohn's disease in 1999. In a 94-patient, phase II clinical trial, the researchers showed Infliximab was effective in closing fistulae between the [[skin]] and [[bowel]] in 56-68% of patients.<!--

-->A large, 296-patient, Phase III clinical trial called the ACCENT 2 trial, showed infliximab was additionally beneficial in maintaining closure of fistulae, with almost two-thirds of all patients treated with the three initial doses of infliximab having a fistula response after 14 weeks, and 36% of patients maintaining closure of fistulae after a year, compared with 19% who received [[placebo]] therapy.  This final trial resulted in the FDA approval of the drug to treat fistulizing disease.<!--

====Inflammatory disease====
Infliximab has been used to induce and maintain remission in inflammatory Crohn's disease.  The ACCENT 1 trial,  a large, multicentre trial, found 39 to 45% of patients treated with infliximab, who had an initial response to it, maintained remission after 30 weeks, compared with 21% who received placebo treatment.  It also showed a mean maintenance of remission from 38 to 54 weeks compared with 21 weeks for patients who received placebo treatment.<ref name=ACCENT1>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanauer SB, Feagan BG, Lichtenstein GR, Mayer LF, Schreiber S, Colombel JF, Rachmilewitz D, Wolf DC, Olson A, Bao W, Rutgeerts P | title = Maintenance infliximab for Crohn's disease: the ACCENT I randomised trial | journal = Lancet | volume = 359 | issue = 9317 | pages = 1541–9 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 12047962 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08512-4 }}</ref>

Crohn's patients have flares of their disease between periods of disease quiescence.  Severe flares are usually treated with [[Prednisone|steroid]] medications to obtain remission, but steroids have many undesirable side effects, so some gastroenterologists are now advocating the use of infliximab as the first drug to try to get patients into [[remission (medicine)|remission]].  This has been called the top-down approach to treatment.<!--
--><ref name=topdown>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanauer SB | title = Crohn's disease: step up or top down therapy | journal = Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 131–7 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12617888 | doi = 10.1053/bega.2003.0361 }}</ref>

===Ulcerative colitis===
Infliximab targets [[tumour necrosis factor|TNF]], thought to be more related to [[T helper cell#Th1/Th2 Model for helper T cells|Th1]] cytokines.  Ulcerative colitis was thought to be a [[T helper cell#Th1/Th2 Model for helper T cells|Th2]] disease, and infliximab would be of limited use.  However, patients with ulcerative colitis have begun to be treated with infliximab on the basis of two large clinical trials conducted in 2005 by Paul Rutgeerts and William Sandborn.  The Acute ulcerative Colitis Treatment trials (ACT1 and ACT2) to evaluate the utility of infliximab in ulcerative colitis showed 44-45% of patients treated with infliximab for a year maintained a response to the medication, compared with 21% of patients who were treated with placebo medication.  At two months, the response was 61-69% for patients treated with infliximab, and 31% for those treated with placebo.<ref name=ACT>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rutgeerts P, Sandborn WJ, Feagan BG, Reinisch W, Olson A, Johanns J, Travers S, Rachmilewitz D, Hanauer SB, Lichtenstein GR, de Villiers WJ, Present D, Sands BE, Colombel JF | title = Infliximab for induction and maintenance therapy for ulcerative colitis | journal = [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] | volume = 353 | issue = 23 | pages = 2462–76 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16339095 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa050516 }}</ref>

===Psoriatic arthritis===
In [[psoriatic arthritis]] (PsA), inhibitors of TNF, such as infliximab, improve the signs and symptoms. Several therapies with modest efficacy have been studied in nail psoriasis. Among available agents, higher quality data are available to support the efficacy of cyclosporine and infliximab. Based on studies in AS, the results suggest infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab have the potential to reduce the signs and symptoms of moderate to severely active axial involvement in PsA in patients who have had an inadequate response to NSAID (level 1a, grade A). The anti-TNF agents (infliximab and etanercept; level 1b, grade A) are more effective for the treatment of [[enthesitis]] than traditional agents. Results suggest infliximab is effective for the treatment of [[dactylitis]] in PsA.<ref>

== Adverse effects ==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2009}}

Infliximab has adverse effects, some life-threatening, common to drugs in the class of [[TNF inhibitor|TNF inhibiting]] [[immunosuppressants]] (which also includes etanercept ([[Enbrel]]) and adalimumab ([[Humira]])). Some of the most severe are:

*serious [[infection]]s

Maintenance therapy with the drug (versus intermittent or sporadic therapy) lessens the likelihood of developing antibodies to infliximab which are known to reduce the efficacy of the drug.  Combination treatment with [[methotrexate]] (an antifolate drug which suppresses the immune system) has been shown to reduce the formation of these antibodies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Maini R, St Clair EW, Breedveld F, Furst D, Kalden J, Weisman M, Smolen J, Emery P, Harriman G, Feldmann M, Lipsky P | title = Infliximab (chimeric anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha monoclonal antibody) versus placebo in rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving concomitant methotrexate: a randomised phase III trial.

Infliximab was studied in monotherapy (without concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or [[azathioprine]]) in [[psoriasis]], [[psoriatic arthritis]], and [[ankylosing spondylitis]].<ref name="Maxwell" /> Only its use in [[rheumatoid arthritis]] requires the concomitant use of methotrexate by FDA product labeling; however, the concomitant use of methotrexate in other disease states may help to reduce the body's immune response to the infliximab and increase its duration of efficacy.

== Pharmacology ==
Infliximab is a purified, recombinant DNA-derived [[Chimeric antibody|chimeric]] human-mouse [[Immunoglobulin G|IgG]] [[monoclonal antibody]] that consists of mouse [[Antibody#Heavy chain|heavy]] and [[Antibody#Light chain|light]] chain [[Antibody#Immunoglobulin domains|variable regions]] combined with human heavy and light chain constant regions.<ref name="Akiho1">{{Cite journal|last=Akiho|first=Hirotada|last2=Yokoyama|first2=Azusa|last3=Abe|first3=Shuichi|last4=Nakazono|first4=Yuichi|last5=Murakami|first5=Masatoshi|last6=Otsuka|first6=Yoshihiro|last7=Fukawa|first7=Kyoko|last8=Esaki|first8=Mitsuru|last9=Niina|first9=Yusuke|date=2015-11-15|title=Promising biological therapies for ulcerative colitis: A review of the literature|journal=World Journal of Gastrointestinal Pathophysiology|volume=6|issue=4|pages=219–227|doi=10.4291/wjgp.v6.i4.219|issn=2150-5330|pmc=4644886|pmid=26600980}}</ref> It has a [[Biological half-life|serum half-life]] of 9.5 days and can be detected in serum 8 weeks after infusion treatment.<ref name="Akiho1"/>

Infliximab neutralizes the biological activity of [[TNF alpha|TNF-α]] by binding with high [[Affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] to the soluble (free floating in the blood) and transmembrane (located on the outer membranes of [[T cells]] and similar immune cells) forms of TNF-α, and inhibits or prevents the effective binding of TNF-α with its receptors. Infliximab and [[adalimumab]] (another TNF antagonist) are in the subclass of "anti-TNF antibodies" (they are in the form of naturally occurring antibodies), and are capable of neutralizing all forms (extracellular-, [[transmembrane]]-, and [[Receptor (immunology)|receptor]]-bound) TNF-α.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Choy EH, Panayi GS | title = Cytokine pathways and joint inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis | journal = [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] | volume = 344 | issue = 12 | pages = 907–16 | date = March 2001 | pmid = 11259725 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200103223441207 }}</ref> Etanercept, a third TNF antagonist, is in a different subclass (receptor-construct fusion protein), and, because of its modified form, cannot neutralize receptor-bound TNF-α.<ref>Etanercept product labeling</ref> Additionally, the anti-TNF antibodies [[adalimumab]] and infliximab have the capability of [[lysing]] cells involved in the inflammatory process, whereas the receptor fusion protein apparently lacks this capability.<ref>Etanercept, Adalimumab and Infliximab product labeling</ref> Although the clinical significance of these differences have not been absolutely proven, [[etanercept]], has been shown to perform worse than placebo for Crohn's disease. These differences may account for the differential actions of these drugs in both efficacy and side effects.

Infliximab has high [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]] for TNF-α, and does not neutralize TNF beta (TNFβ, also called [[lymphotoxin]] α), an unrelated cytokine that uses different receptors from TNF-α. Biological activities attributed to TNF-α include induction of [[proinflammatory]] [[cytokine]]s (such as [[interleukin]]s IL-1 and IL-6), enhancement of [[leukocyte]] movement or migration from the blood vessels into the tissues (by increasing the permeability of [[endothelial]] layer of blood vessels), and increasing the release of [[adhesion molecule]]s. Infliximab prevents disease in [[transgenic]] mice (a special type of mice biologically engineered to produce a human form of TNF-α and which are used to test the results of these drugs that might be expected in humans). These experimental mice develop arthritis as a result of their production of human TNF-α, and when administered after disease onset, infliximab allows eroded joints to heal.

Other monoclonal antibodies targeting TNF-α are [[golimumab]], [[adalimumab]], and [[certolizumab pegol]]. [[Etanercept]] also binds and inhibits the action of TNF-α, but is not a monoclonal antibody (it is instead a fusion of [[CD120|TNF-receptor]] and an [[Fc region|antibody constant region]]).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Peppel K, Crawford D, Beutler B | title = A tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-IgG heavy chain chimeric protein as a bivalent antagonist of TNF activity | journal = J.

=== Availability/affordability ===
Like all of the TNF inhibitors, infliximab is an expensive medication, costing about US$900 for a 100&nbsp;mg dose, and within the United States is covered by almost every medical insurance plan (though caps on many plans make it possible to be covered for only a subset of treatments in the course of a year).{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Infliximab is supplied as a sterile, white, lyophilized (freeze-dried) powder,<ref>http://www.rxlist.com/remicade-drug.htm</ref> so must be reconstituted and administered by a health care professional, usually in a hospital or office setting.<ref name="JNJ_20071106_141812" /> For this reason, it is usually covered under major medical insurance rather than prescription drug coverage. The loading regimen for all approved indications occurs at weeks 0, 2, and 6 at the above dosages.<ref name="JNJ_20071106_141812" />
