==Financing==
On 21 September 2015, the [[European Investment Bank]] signed a EUR 45 million financing agreement for Bial's R&D over the next 3 years. It was directed to "discover, develop and provide therapeutic solutions in [...] three major areas of research: central nervous system (CNS), cardiology and allergen immunotherapy". The EIB found Bial not to have the status of a [[General contractor|contracting entity]], and therefore Bial has not been subject to [[public procurement in the European Union|EU rules on public procurement]].<ref>[http://www.eib.org/projects/pipeline/2015/20150078.htm BIAL INOVACAO RDI II] European Investment Bank, 7 April 2015, retrieved 19 January 2016.</ref>
