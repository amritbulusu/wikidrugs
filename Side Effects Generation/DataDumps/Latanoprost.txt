==Medical uses==

===Open-angle glaucoma===
[[File:Latanoprost.jpg|thumb|Latanoprost]]
In people with [[ocular hypertension]] including [[open-angle glaucoma]] (IOP ≥21&nbsp;[[Millimeter of mercury|mm Hg]]), treatment with latanoprost reduced IOP levels by 22 to 39% over 1 to 12&nbsp;months’ treatment. Latanoprost was more effective than [[timolol]] 0.5% twice daily in 3 of 4 large (n = 163 to 267) randomised, double-blind trials. Latanoprost demonstrated a stable long-term IOP-lowering effect in 1- or 2-year continuations of these trials, with no sign of diminishing effect during prolonged treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Perry CM, McGavin JK, Culy CR, Ibbotson T |title= Latanoprost. An Update of its Use in Glaucoma and Ocular Hypertension |journal= Drugs & Aging |volume=20|issue=8 |pages=597–630 |year=2003 |pmid=12795627 |doi= 10.2165/00002512-200320080-00005|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00002512-200320080-00005}}</ref>

[[Meta-analysis]] suggests that latanoprost is more effective than timolol in lowering IOP. However, it often causes [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] pigmentation. While current evidence suggests that this pigmentation is benign, careful lifetime evaluation of patients is still justified.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang WY, Wan Po AL, Dua HS, Azuara-Blanco A |title= Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing latanoprost with timolol in the treatment of patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension |journal= British Journal of Ophthalmology |volume=85|issue= |pages=983–990 |year=2001 |pmid=11466259 |doi= 10.1136/bjo.85.8.983|pmc=1724079}}</ref>

===Closed-angle glaucoma===
Patients who had elevated IOP despite iridotomy and/or iridectomy (including patients of Asian descent), latanoprost was significantly more effective than timolol in two double-blind, monotherapy trials (8.2 and 8.8&nbsp;mm Hg vs 5.2 and 5.7&nbsp;mm Hg for latanoprost vs timolol at 12 and 2&nbsp;weeks, respectively).<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Aung T |author2=Wong HT |author3=Yip CC |title=Comparison of the intraocular pressure-lowering effect of latanoprost and timolol in patients with chronic angle closure glaucoma: a preliminary study. |journal=Ophthalmology |volume=107|issue=6 |pages=1178–83 |year=2000 |pmid=10857840 |doi=10.1016/s0161-6420(00)00073-7|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Listed from most to least common:<ref name="PPA" /><ref name="AC" />

* >&nbsp;5–15%: blurred vision, burning and stinging, conjunctival [[hyperemia]], foreign body sensation, itching, increased (brown) pigmentation of the iris causing ([[Heterochromia iridum|heterochromia]]), lengthening and thickening of the eyelashes (used, like [[bimatoprost]], in the cosmetic industry as eyelash growth enhancers), [[Thygeson's superficial punctate keratopathy|punctate epithelial keratopathy]]
* 4%: cold or upper respiratory tract infections, flu-like syndrome
* 1–4%: dry eyes, excessive tearing, eye pain, lid crusting, lid [[edema]], lid [[erythema]] (hyperemia), lid pain, [[photophobia]]
* 1–2%: chest pain, allergic skin reactions, [[arthralgia]], back pain, [[myalgia]]
* <&nbsp;1&nbsp;% (only severe or life-threatening effects): asthma, herpes [[keratitis]], iritis, keratitis, retinal artery [[embolus]], retinal detachment, [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]], [[uveitis]], vitreous hemorrhage from [[diabetic retinopathy]]

Research suggests that wiping the eye with an absorbent pad after the administration of eye drops can result in shorter eyelashes and a lesser chance of hyperpigmentation in the eyelid, compared to not wiping off excess fluid.<ref name="Xu">{{cite journal |author=Xu L, Wang X, Wu M |title= Topical medication instillation techniques for glaucoma |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume= |issue=2|pages= CD010520 |date=2017 |pmid= 28218404|doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD010520.pub2}}</ref>

===Pregnancy===
Use in pregnant women is limited due to high incidence of abortion shown in animal experiments. Because of this, latanoprost is classified as risk factor C (adverse events were observed in animal reproduction studies at maternally toxic doses) according to United States [[Food and Drug Administration]]'s use-in-pregnancy ratings.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=15289149|year=2004|author1=De Santis|first1=M|title=Latanoprost exposure in pregnancy|journal=American Journal of Ophthalmology|volume=138|issue=2|pages=305–6|last2=Lucchese|first2=A|last3=Carducci|first3=B|last4=Cavaliere|first4=A.

==Interactions==
Interactions are similar to other prostaglandin analogs. Paradoxically, the concomitant use of latanoprost and [[bimatoprost]] or other prostaglandins may result in increased intraocular pressure.
[[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs) can reduce or increase the effect of latanoprost.<ref name="PPA">Latanoprost {{drugs.com|PPA|latanoprost}}.</ref><ref name="AC">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2015|language=German}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
Like [[tafluprost]] and [[travoprost]], latanoprost is an [[ester]] [[prodrug]] that is activated to the free acid in the [[cornea]]. Also like the related drugs, latanoprost acid is an analog of [[prostaglandin F2α|prostaglandin F<sub>2α</sub>]] that acts as a selective [[agonist]] at the [[prostaglandin F receptor]].  Prostaglandins increase the sclera's permeability to aqueous fluid. So, an increase in prostaglandin activity increases outflow of aqueous fluid thus lowering intraocular pressure.<ref name="PPA" /><ref name="AC" />

===Pharmacokinetics===
Latanoprost is absorbed well through the cornea and completely hydrolysed to the active latanoprost acid. Highest concentrations of the acid in the aqueous humour are reached two hours after application, lowering of intraocular pressure starts after 3 to 4 hours, the highest effect is found after 8 to 12 hours, and its action lasts at least 24 hours. When latanoprost acid reaches the circulation, it is quickly metabolised in the liver by [[beta oxidation]] to 1,2-dinor- and 1,2,3,4-tetranor-latanoprost acid; blood plasma half life is only 17 minutes. The metabolites are mainly excreted via the kidney.<ref name="PPA" /><ref name="AC" />

The activation and deactivation pathway is analogous to the one of tafluprost; see [[Tafluprost#Pharmacokinetics]] for chemical formulae.

==Chemistry==

===Stability===
Latanoprost exhibits [[Thermostability|thermal]] and [[Photodegradation|solar instability]]. The concentration of latanoprost stored at 50&nbsp;°C will decrease by 10% every 8.25 days. When stored at 70&nbsp;°C the concentration will decrease by 10% every 1.32 days. Ultraviolet light, for example in sunlight, causes rapid degradation of latanoprost.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Morgan PV, Proniuk S, Blanchard J, Noecker RJ |title=  Effect of temperature and light on the stability of latanoprost and its clinical relevance | journal= Journal of Glaucoma |volume=10|issue=5 |pages=401–405 |year=2001 |pmid=11711838 |doi= 10.1097/00061198-200110000-00007| url=http://journals.lww.com/glaucomajournal/Abstract/2001/10000/Effect_of_Temperature_and_Light_on_the_Stability.7.aspx}}</ref>
