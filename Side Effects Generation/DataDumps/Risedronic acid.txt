'''Risedronic acid''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) often used as its sodium salt '''risedronate sodium''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]) is a [[bisphosphonate]] used to strengthen [[bone]], treat or prevent [[osteoporosis]], and treat [[Paget's disease of bone|Paget's disease]] of bone. It is produced and marketed by [[Warner Chilcott]], [[Sanofi-Aventis]], and in Japan by [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company|Takeda]] under the trade names '''Actonel''', '''Atelvia''', and '''Benet'''. It is also available in a preparation that includes a calcium carbonate supplement, as '''Actonel with Calcium'''.

==Administration==
Risedronate is taken orally, usually weekly or monthly.  Notably, if risedronate lodges in the [[esophagus]], it can lead to esophageal [[Peptic ulcer|ulcers]]. Therefore, it is recommended that risedronate be taken with the body upright, and followed by a glass of water.  Moreover, risedronate is poorly absorbed when taken with food, so it is recommended that no food or drink other than water be taken for 2 hours before and 30 minutes after taking risedronate. Risedronate has a faster esophageal transit time and different chemical chain which results in less gastrointestinal side-effects than other drugs in this class. The dosage instructions also show that risedronate can be taken with less water than other drugs in the class.
Risedronate is also available as a 75&nbsp;mg tablet to be taken on two consecutive days each month (2CDM) in order to optimize patient adherence. This formulation has been studied in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multinational trial in 1229 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.<ref name="risedronate">Frampton JE.

==Controversies==
In January 2006 [[Procter & Gamble|P&G]] and its marketing partner [[Sanofi-Aventis]] filed a [[Lanham Act]] false claims lawsuit against rival drugmakers [[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche]] and [[GlaxoSmithKline]] claiming false advertising about [[Ibandronic acid|Boniva]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uk.pg.com/news/newsReleases2006/jan0406_P&G_Pharmaceuticals_Sanofi-AventisUSLLC_File_Lawsuit.html |title=P&G Press statement |publisher=Uk.pg.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref> The manufacturers of Boniva, a rival bisphosphonate, were accused in the suit of causing a "serious public health risk" through misrepresentation of scientific findings. In a ruling on September 7, 2006 U.S. District Judge Paul A. Crotty rejected P&G's attempted injunction. P&G was criticized for attempting to "preserve its market share by denigrating Boniva". Judge Crotty wrote that "Roche was clearly entitled to respond with its own data, provided that the data was truthfully and accurately presented".<ref>[http://www.topix.net/content/ap/3458843697085346378233666743703364096132 NY fed judge finds promotions for bone drug Boniva are fair Associated Press, 7 Sept 2006] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

In 2006, P&G faced controversy over its handling of clinical research involving risedronate (News Reports<ref>http://www.thejabberwock.org/wiki/index.php?title=Actonel_Case_Media_Reports</ref> and discussion).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com |title=Scientific Misconduct Blog |publisher=Scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>

In common with other [[bisphosphonate]] drugs, risedronate appears to be associated with the rare side effect [[osteonecrosis of the jaw]], often preceded by dental procedures inducing trauma to the bone.
