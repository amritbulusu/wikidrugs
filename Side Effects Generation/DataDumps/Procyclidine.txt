'''Procyclidine''' is an [[anticholinergic]] [[medication|drug]] principally used for the treatment of drug-induced [[parkinsonism]], [[akathisia]] and acute [[dystonia]]; [[Parkinson disease]]; and [[idiopathic]] or secondary [[dystonia]].

== Uses ==
It is used in patients with [[parkinsonism]] and [[akathisia]], and to reduce the side effects of [[antipsychotic]] treatment given  for  [[schizophrenia]]. Procyclidine is also a second-line drug for the treatment of [[Parkinson's disease]].  It improves [[tremor]] but not rigidity or [[bradykinesia]].

Procyclidine is also sometimes used for the treatment of [[dystonia]] (but not [[tardive dyskinesia]]), a rare disorder that causes abnormal muscle contraction, resulting in twisting postures of limbs, trunk, or face.

== Overdose ==
Signs of procyclidine overdose are those of an [[anticholinergic]] and include confusion, agitation and sleeplessness that can last up to or more than 24 hours. Pupils become dilated and unreactive to light. [[Tachycardia]] (fast heart beat), as well as auditory and visual hallucinations have also been reported. 

Other known symptoms of overdose are: clumsiness or unsteadiness, being severely drowsy, having a severely dry mouth, nose, or throat, having an altered mood or other mental changes, seizures, being short of breath or having troubled breathing, a dry and warm, flushed skin.

A suspected overdose with severe life-threatening symptoms should immediately be brought to medical attention, where reversal can be attempted with [[physostigmine]] administered intravenously or subcutaneously.

==Synthesis==
[[File:Procyclidine synthesis.png|thumb|center|500px|Procyclidine synthesis: {{Cite patent|DE|1084734}} {{US patent|2826590}}]]
Procyclidine, 1-cyclohexyl-1-phenyl-3-pyrrolidinopropan-1-ol, is synthesized in exactly the same manner as was seen for [[trihexyphenidyl]], except this time the linear synthesis begins with the preparation of 3-(1-pyrrolidino)propiophenone.

In an interesting variation, the ketone is first reacted with phenylmagnesium bromide. [[Catalytic hydrogenation]] of the [[carbinol]] thus obtained can be stopped after the reduction of only one aromatic ring.
