'''Amorolfine''' (or '''amorolfin'''), is a morpholine [[Antifungal|antifungal drug]] that inhibits [[Delta14-sterol reductase|Δ<sup>14</sup>-sterol reductase]] and [[Cholestenol Delta-isomerase|cholestenol Δ-isomerase]], which depletes [[ergosterol]] and causes [[ignosterol]] to accumulate in the fungal [[cytoplasmic]] [[cell membranes]]. Marketed as '''Curanail''', '''Loceryl''', '''Locetar''', and '''Odenil''', amorolfine is commonly available in the form of a [[Nail polish|nail lacquer]], containing 5% amorolfine hydrochloride as the active ingredient. It is used to treat [[onychomycosis]] (fungal infection of the toe- and fingernails). Amorolfine 5% nail lacquer in once-weekly or twice-weekly applications has been shown in two studies to be between 60% and 71% effective in treating toenail onychomycosis; complete cure rates three months after stopping treatment (after six months of treatment) were 38% and 46%. However, full experimental details of these trials were not available and since they were first reported in 1992 there have been no subsequent trials.<ref name=Williams/>

It is a ''[[Topical medication|topical]]'' solution for the treatment of toenail infections. ''[[Systemic administration|Systemic]]'' treatments may be considered more effective.<ref name=Williams>{{cite book | title=Evidence-Based Dermatology | author=Hywel C.

It is approved for sale [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] in Australia, Russia and the UK (recently re-classified to over-the-counter status), and is approved for the treatment of toenail fungus by prescription in other countries. It is not approved for the treatment of onychomycosis in the United States or Canada, but can be ordered from there by mail from other countries.<ref>It can readily be verified that Curanail is advertised on websites such as US [[Amazon.com]], shipped from abroad.</ref>
