As of 2015 the cost for a typical month of medication in the United States is 50 to 100 USD.<ref name=Ric2015>{{cite book|last1=Hamilton|first1=Richart|title=Tarascon Pocket Pharmacopoeia 2015 Deluxe Lab-Coat Edition|date=2015|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning|isbn=9781284057560|page=9}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
Ketoprofen is generally prescribed for arthritis-related inflammatory pains or severe toothaches that result in the inflammation of the gums.

Ketoprofen topical patches are being used for treatment of musculoskeletal pain.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 16078335 | year = 2005 | last1 = Mazières | first1 = B | last2 = Rouanet | first2 = S | last3 = Guillon | first3 = Y | last4 = Scarsi | first4 = C | last5 = Reiner | first5 = V | title = Topical ketoprofen patch in the treatment of tendinitis: a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. | volume = 32 | issue = 8 | pages = 1563–70 | journal = The Journal of rheumatology}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.2165/00126839-200506060-00003 | pmid = 16274258 | year = 2005 | last1 = Mazières | first1 = B | title = Topical ketoprofen patch. | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 337–44 | journal = Drugs in R&D}}</ref><ref name=Sekiya>{{cite journal | pmid = 20087696 | year = 2010 | last1 = Sekiya | first1 = I | pages = 154–58 | last2 = Morito | first2 = T | last3 = Hara | issue = 1 | first3 = K | last4 = Yamazaki | first4 = J | pmc = 2850498 | last5 = Ju | first5 = YJ | volume = 11 | last6 = Yagishita | first6 = K | last7 = Mochizuki | first7 = T | last8 = Tsuji | first8 = K | last9 = Muneta | first9 = T | title = Ketoprofen Absorption by Muscle and Tendon after Topical or Oral Administration in Patients Undergoing Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction | doi = 10.1208/s12249-009-9367-2 | journal = AAPS PharmSciTech }}</ref>

Ketoprofen can also be used for treatment of some pain, especially nerve pain such as [[sciatica]], [[postherpetic neuralgia]] and [[referred pain]] for [[radiculopathy]], in the form of a cream, ointment, liquid, spray, or gel, which may also contain [[ketamine]] and [[lidocaine]], along with other agents which may be useful, such as [[cyclobenzaprine]], [[amitriptyline]], [[acyclovir]], [[gabapentin]], [[orphenadrine]] and other drugs used as NSAIDs or adjuvant, atypical or potentiators for pain treatment.

===Efficacy===
A [[systematic review]] indicated "The efficacy of orally administered ketoprofen in relieving moderate-severe pain and improving functional status and general condition was significantly better than that of [[ibuprofen]] and/or [[diclofenac]]."<ref name=Sarzi-Puttini2013>{{cite journal | last1=Sarzi-Puttini | first1=P | author2=Atzeni, F; Lanata, L; Bagnasco, M | title=Efficacy of ketoprofen vs. ibuprofen and diclofenac: a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis | journal=Clinical and experimental rheumatology | date=2013 | volume=31 | issue=5 | pages=731–8 | pmid=23711416 | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0063862/}}</ref> A [[Cochrane review|Cochrane systematic review]] investigating ketoprofen as a single-dose by mouth in acute, moderate-to-severe postoperative pain concluded that its efficacy is equivalent to drugs such as ibuprofen and diclofenac.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gaskell|first=Helen|last2=Derry|first2=Sheena|last3=Wiffen|first3=Philip J.|last4=Moore|first4=R.

==Interactions==
Ketoprofen should not be used in combination with other NSAIDs or corticosteroids, as this increases the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) ulceration.  It should also be used with caution with other anticoagulants.  It is commonly used with [[omeprazole]], [[sucralfate]], and [[cimetidine]] to help protect the GI tract.

==Mechanism==
The patches have been shown to provide rapid and sustained delivery to underlying tissues without significantly increasing levels of drug concentration in the blood when compared to the traditional oral administration.<ref name=Sekiya/><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 18689771 | year = 2008 | last1 = Gayman | first1 = MD | last2 = Turner | first2 = RJ | last3 = Cui | first3 = M | title = Physical Limitations and Depressive Symptoms: Exploring the Nature of the Association | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | pages = S219–S228 | journal = The journals of gerontology.

==Available forms==
Ketoprofen was available [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] in the United States in the form of 12.5 [[milligram|mg]] coated tablets (Orudis KT and Actron), but this form has been discontinued. It is available by [[Medical prescription|prescription]] capsules.

Ketoprofen is also available as a 2.5% [[gel]] for [[topical]] application, and it is also available as a patch for topical analgesia and anti-inflammatory action. However, the gel is not sold in the United States.

Brand names in Australia are Orudis and Oruvail. It is available in Japan in a transdermal patch Mohrus Tape, made by [[Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical]].  It is available in the UK as Ketoflam and Oruvail, in Ireland as Fastum Gel, in Estonia as Keto, Ketonal, and Fastum Gel, in Finland as Ketorin, Keto, Ketomex, and Orudis; in France as Profénid, Bi-Profénid and Ketum; in Italy as Ketodol, Fastum Gel, Lasonil, Orudis and Oki; in Poland, Serbia, Slovenia and Croatia as Knavon and Ketonal; in Romania as Ketonal; in Mexico as Arthril; in Norway as Zon and Orudis; in Russia as ОКИ (OKI), Fastum Gel and Ketonal; in Spain as Actron and Fastum Gel; and in Venezuela as Ketoprofeno under an injectable solution of 100&nbsp;mg and 150&nbsp;mg capsules.

In Lithuania, ketoprofen is called Ketoprofenum and Ketoprofenas.  For topical application: the name brands are Fastum with 2.5% (gel) which is over the counter, and Ketospray with 10% (liquid spray), which must be prescribed. In Switzerland, an innovative ketoprofen formulation based on [[transfersome]] technology for direct application on the skin above the site to be treated has been approved.

In some countries, the optically pure (''S'')-enantiomer ([[dexketoprofen]]) is available; its [[Tris|trometamol]] salt is said to be particularly rapidly reabsorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, having a rapid onset of effects.

The earliest report of therapeutic use in humans was in 1972 <ref>{{cite journal | author = A. N. Gyory, M. Bloch, H. C. Burry, R.

==Veterinary medicine==
Ketoprofen is a common NSAID, [[antipyretic]], and [[analgesic]] used in horses and other equines.<ref>Forney, Barbara C, MS, VMD.  ''Equine Medications'', Revised Edition. Blood Horse Publications. Lexington, KY. Copyright 2007.</ref> It is most commonly used for musculoskeletal pain, joint problems, and soft tissue injury, as well as [[laminitis]]. It is also used to control fevers and prevent [[endotoxemia]]. It is also used as a mild painkiller in smaller animals, generally following surgical procedures.

In horses, it is given at a dose of 2.2&nbsp;mg/kg/day. Studies have shown that it does not inhibit [[5-lipoxygenase]] and [[leukotriene B4]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Salman | first1 = JA | last2 = Tilling | first2 = LC | last3 = Monscada | first3 = S | year = 1984 | title = Benoxaprofen does not inhibit formation of leukotriene B4 in a model of acute inflammation | url = | journal = Biochem Pharmacol | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 28–2930 }}</ref> as originally claimed.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Betley | first1 = M | last2 = Sutherland | first2 = SF | last3 = Gregoricka | first3 = MJ | last4 = Pollett | first4 = RA | year = 1991 | title = The analgesic effect of ketoprofen for use in treating equine colic as compared to flunixin meglumine | url = | journal = Equine Pract | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 11–16 }}</ref> It is therefore not considered superior to [[phenylbutazone]] as previously believed, although clinical signs of lameness are reduced with its use.<ref>Owens JG, Kamerling SG, Keowen ML. Anti-inflammatory effects and pharmacokinetics of ketoprofen in a model of equine synovitis, in Proceedings. 6th Int Cong Eur Assoc
Vet Pharmacol Toxicol 1994;170–171.</ref> In fact, phenylbutazone was shown superior to ketoprofen in cases of experimentally-induced synovitis when both drugs were used at labeled dosages.<ref>Owens JG, Kamerling SG, Stanton SR, et al. Effects of pretreatment with ketoprofen and phenylbutazone on experi-
mentally induced synovitis in dogs. 866 – 872.</ref>

===Administration===
Ketoprofen, when administered [[intravenously]], is recommended for a maximum of five days of use.  Its analgesic and antipyretic effects begin to occur one to two hours following administration.  The most common dosage is 1&nbsp;mg/ lb, once per day, although this dosage may be lowered for ponies, which are most susceptible to NSAID side effects.  
It is also available as a capsule dosage form and a tablet.

===Ecological problems===
{{See also|Indian vulture crisis}}
Experiments have found ketoprofen, like [[diclofenac]], is a veterinary drug causing lethal effects in [[red-headed vulture]]s. Vultures feeding on the carcasses of recently treated livestock suffer acute kidney failure within days of exposure.<ref name="Naidoo2009">{{cite journal|vauthors=Naidoo V, Wolter K, Cromarty D, Diekmann M, Duncan N, Meharg AA, Taggart MA, Venter L, Cuthbert R |year=2009|title=Toxicity of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to Gyps vultures: a new threat from ketoprofen|journal=Biology Letters|volume=6|issue=3|pages=339–341|issn=1744-9561|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.0818|pmid=20007163|pmc=2880042}}</ref>
