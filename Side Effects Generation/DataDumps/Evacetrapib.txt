'''Evacetrapib''' was a [[medication|drug]] under development by [[Eli Lilly & Company]] (investigational name '''LY2484595''') that inhibits [[cholesterylester transfer protein]] ([[CETP inhibitor]]). CETP collects [[triglyceride]]s from [[very low-density lipoprotein]]s (VLDL) or [[low-density lipoprotein]]s (LDL) and exchanges them for [[cholesteryl ester]]s from [[high-density lipoprotein]]s (HDL), and vice versa, but primarily increasing high-density lipoprotein and lowering low-density lipoprotein. It is thought that modifying lipoprotein levels modifies the risk of [[cardiovascular disease]].<ref name="pmid21957197"/> The first CETP inhibitor, [[torcetrapib]], was unsuccessful because it increased levels of the hormone [[aldosterone]] and increased [[blood pressure]],<ref name="pmid19522058"/> which led to excess cardiac events when it was studied.<ref name="pmid19522058"/> Evacetrapib does not have the same effect.<ref name="pmid21957197">{{cite journal |vauthors=Cao G, Beyer TP, Zhang Y |title=Evacetrapib is a novel, potent, and selective inhibitor of cholesteryl ester transfer protein that elevates HDL cholesterol without inducing aldosterone or increasing blood pressure |journal=J.

Evacetrapib evaluation for treatment of high-risk vascular disease was discontinued due to lack of efficacy, as had already happened in the past with two other CETP inhibitors ([[torcetrapib]] and [[dalcetrapib]]<ref name="pmid23126252">{{cite journal |author=Schwartz GG |title=Effects of dalcetrapib in patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome. |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=367 |issue=22 |pages=2089–99 |date=Nov 2015 |pmid=23126252|display-authors=etal |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1206797}}</ref>) due to increased deaths and little identifiable cardiovascular benefit (despite substantial increases in HDL).

===ACCELERATE===
In a 2014 study in 165 Japanese patients Evacetrapib decreased CETP activity alone or in combination with atorvastatin.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of evacetrapib administered as monotherapy or in combination with atorvastatin in Japanese patients with dyslipidemia|date = Jun 15, 2014|journal = Am J Cardiol.|accessdate = |doi = 10.1016/j.amjcard.2014.03.045|pmid = 24786356 |volume=113 |pages=2021–9}}</ref>

An interim analysis performed in October 7 led the Data Monitoring Committee to support a recommendation to stop the study as the totality of evidence suggested that evacetrapib was unlikely to be superior to placebo.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://investor.lilly.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=936130|title = Lilly to Discontinue Development of Evacetrapib for High-Risk Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}</ref> ACCENTUATE is studying patients with hyperlipidemia or diabetes.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02227784|title = Study of Evacetrapib (LY2484595) in Participants With High Cholesterol (ACCENTUATE)|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}</ref>
