'''Insulin glargine''', marketed under the names '''Lantus''', among others, is a long-acting basal [[insulin analogue]], given once daily to help control the [[blood sugar]] level of those with [[diabetes]]. It consists of microcrystals that slowly release insulin, giving a long duration of action of 18 to 26 hours, with a "peakless" profile (according to the insulin glargine package insert). Pharmacokinetically, it resembles basal insulin secretion of non-diabetic pancreatic beta cells. Sometimes, in type 2 diabetes and in combination with a short acting [[sulfonylurea]] (drugs which stimulate the pancreas to make more insulin), it can offer moderate control of serum glucose levels. In the absence of endogenous insulin—type 1 diabetes, depleted [[diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2]] (in some cases) or [[Latent autoimmune diabetes|latent autoimmune diabetes of adults]] in late stage—insulin glargine needs the support of fast acting insulin taken with food to reduce the effect of prandially derived glucose.

==Medical uses==
The long-acting insulin class, which includes insulin glargine, do not appear much better than neutral protamine Hagedorn [[NPH insulin|(NPH) insulin]] but have a significantly greater cost making them, as of 2010, not cost effective.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Waugh|first=N|author2=Cummins, E |author3=Royle, P |author4=Clar, C |author5=Marien, M |author6=Richter, B |author7=Philip, S |title=Newer agents for blood glucose control in type 2 diabetes: systematic review and economic evaluation|journal=Health technology assessment (Winchester, England)|date=July 2010|volume=14|issue=36|pages=1–248|pmid=20646668|doi=10.3310/hta14360}}</ref> It is unclear if there is a difference in [[hypoglycemia]] and not enough data to determine any differences with respect to long term outcomes.<ref name=Singh2009>{{cite journal |vauthors=Singh SR, Ahmad F, Lal A, Yu C, Bai Z, Bennett H |title=Efficacy and safety of insulin analogues for the management of diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis |journal=CMAJ|volume=180 |issue=4 |pages=385–97 |date=February 2009 |pmid=19221352 |pmc=2638025 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.081041|url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=19221352}}</ref>

===Mixing with other insulins===
Unlike some other longer-acting insulins, glargine must not be diluted or mixed with other insulin or solution in the same syringe.<ref>{{cite journal |author=American Diabetes Association |year=2003 |title=Position statement: Insulin administration |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=26 |issue=Suppl. 1 |pages=121–124 | doi=10.2337/diacare.26.2007.S121 }}</ref> However, this restriction has been questioned.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kaplan |first=W. |title=Effects of Mixing Glargine and Short-Acting Insulin Analogs on Glucose Control |journal=Diabetes Care |year=2004 |volume=27 |issue=11|pages=2739–2740 |pmid=15505016 |doi=10.2337/diacare.27.11.2739 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==

As of 2012 tentative evidence shows no association between insulin glargine and [[cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tang|first1=X|last2=Yang|first2=L|last3=He|first3=Z|last4=Liu|first4=J|title=Insulin glargine and cancer risk in patients with diabetes: a meta-analysis.|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2012|volume=7|issue=12|pages=e51814|pmid=23284776|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0051814|pmc=3526637}}</ref> Previous studies had raised concerns.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rendell|first1=M|last2=Akturk|first2=HK|last3=Tella|first3=SH|title=Glargine safety, diabetes and cancer.|journal=Expert opinion on drug safety|date=March 2013|volume=12|issue=2|pages=247–63|pmid=23394441|doi=10.1517/14740338.2013.770469}}</ref>

== Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
Insulin glargine has a substitution of glycine for asparagine at N21 (Asn21) and two arginines added to the carboxy terminal of B chain.  The arginine amino acids shifts the isoelectric point from a pH of 5.4 to 6.7, making the molecule more soluble at an acidic pH and less soluble at physiological pH. The isoelectric shift also allows for the subcutaneous injection of a clear solution. The glycine substitution prevents [[deamidation]] of the acid-sensitive asparagine at acidic pH. In the neutral subcutaneous space, higher-order aggregates form, resulting in a slow, peakless dissolution and absorption of insulin from the site of injection.<ref name="Bolli">{{cite journal |author=Bolli, G.|year=1999 |title=Insulin analogues and their potential in the management of diabetes mellitus. |journal=Diabetologia |volume=42 |issue=10 |pages=1151–1167 |pmid=10525654 |doi=10.1007/s001250051286|display-authors=etal}}</ref> It can achieve a peakless level for at least 24 hours.

===Acceptance and repartition in the body===

Insulin glargine is formulated at an acidic pH 4, where it is completely water-soluble. After subcutaneous injection of the acidic solute (which can cause discomfort and a stinging sensation), when a physiologic pH (approximately 7.4) is achieved the increase in pH causes the insulin to come out of solution resulting in the formation of higher order aggregates of insulin hexamers. The higher order aggregation slows the dissociation of the hexamers into insulin monomers, the functional and physiologically active unit of insulin. This gradual process ensures that small amounts of insulin glargine are released into the body continuously, giving an almost peakless profile.

==History==

The development of insulin glargine was conducted at Sanofi-Aventis's biotechnology competence center in Frankfurt-Höchst. Sanofi supplies the product to over 100 countries and more than 3,5 million patients worldwide. This makes Lantus Germany's largest and most important export pharmaceutical product. Sanofi-Aventis increased its turn-over with Lantus around 28% to 2,45 Billion €, therefrom 130 Million € in Germany, where approx. 1.8 million people with diabetes use the product. In 2007 Lantus was the 15th highest selling pharmaceutical product in Germany.

The investment in the production of Lantus and insulin-pen-manufacturing in Frankfurt-Höchst cost 700 Million €. In 2008 a new manufacturing plant was established for further insulin-pen manufacturing with an investment of 150 Million €. At Sanofi-Aventis the production of Lantus created 3000 jobs in Berlin and Frankfurt-Höchst.

On June 9, 2000 the European Commission formally approved the launching of Lantus by Sanofi-Aventis Germany Ltd. in the entire European Union. The admission was prolonged on June 9, 2005.<ref>[http://www.emea.europa.eu/humandocs/PDFs/EPAR/Lantus/061500de1.pdf EPAR Lantus], German summary of admission report of [[European Medicines Agency|EMEA]] (PDF)</ref>

A three-fold more concentrated formulation, brand name Toujeo, was introduced after FDA approval in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.sanofi.us/2015-02-25-Sanofi-Receives-FDA-Approval-of-Once-Daily-Basal-Insulin-Toujeo|title=Sanofi Receives FDA Approval of Once-Daily Basal Insulin Toujeo|author = Sanofi (press release)|date=2015-02-25}}</ref>

==Patent expiry==
Patent protection for insulin glargine expired in most countries in 2015. Insulin glargine from competitor [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] became available in most countries during 2015, under the brand names Basaglar (as a follow-on in the US) and Abasaglar (as a biosimilar in the EU). Biosimilar insulin glargine has only been released in 100U/mL strength to date, and biosimilar equivalents in the 300U/mL strength of Toujeo are yet to launch.<ref>https://www.lillypro.co.uk/diabetes/hcps/our-products/Abasaglar</ref>
