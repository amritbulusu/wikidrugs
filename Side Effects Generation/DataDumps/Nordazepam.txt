'''Nordazepam''' ([[international nonproprietary name|INN]]; marketed under brand names Nordaz, Stilny, Madar, Vegesan, and Calmday; also known as '''nordiazepam''', '''desoxydemoxepam''', and '''desmethyldiazepam''') is a [[benzodiazepine|1,4-benzodiazepine]] derivative. Like other benzodiazepine derivatives, it has [[amnesic]], [[anticonvulsant]], [[anxiolytic]], [[muscle relaxant]], and [[sedative]] properties. However, it is used primarily in the treatment of [[anxiety disorder]]s. It is an [[active metabolite]] of [[diazepam]], [[chlordiazepoxide]], [[clorazepate]], [[prazepam]], [[pinazepam]], and [[medazepam]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ator NA, Griffiths RR |title=Selectivity in the generalization profile in baboons trained to discriminate lorazepam: benzodiazepines, barbiturates and other sedative/anxiolytics |journal=J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. |volume=282 |issue=3 |pages=1442–57 |date=September 1997 |pmid=9316858 |doi= |url=http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9316858}}</ref>

Nordazepam is among the longest lasting (longest half-life) benzodiazepines, and its occurrence as a metabolite is responsible for most cumulative side-effects of its myriad of [[prodrug|pro-drugs]] when they are used repeatedly at moderate-high doses; the nordazepam metabolite [[oxazepam]] is also active (and is a more potent, full BZD-site agonist), which contributes to nordazepam cumulative side-effects but occur too minutely to contribute to the cumulative side-effects of nordazepam pro-drugs (except when they are abused chronically in extremely supra-therapeutic doses).

==Side effects==
Common side effects of nordazepam include [[somnolence]], which is more common in elderly patients and/or people on high-dose regimens. [[Hypotonia]], which is much less common, is also associated with high doses and/or old age.

==Contraindications and special caution==
Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals, and individuals with [[comorbid]] [[psychiatric disorders]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Authier | first1 = N. | last2 = Balayssac | first2 = D. | last3 = Sautereau | first3 = M. | last4 = Zangarelli | first4 = A. | last5 = Courty | first5 = P. | last6 = Somogyi | first6 = AA. | last7 = Vennat | first7 = B. | last8 = Llorca | first8 = PM. | last9 = Eschalier | first9 = A. | title = Benzodiazepine dependence: focus on withdrawal syndrome | journal = Ann Pharm Fr | volume = 67 | issue = 6 | pages = 408–413 |date=November 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharma.2009.07.001 | pmid = 19900604  }}</ref>
In fact, changes in liver function associated with aging or diseases such as cirrhosis, may lead to impaired clearance of nordazepam.<ref name="pmid367407">{{cite journal |vauthors=Klotz U, Müller-Seydlitz P |title=Altered elimination of desmethyldiazepam in the elderly |journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=119–20 | date=January 1979 |pmid=367407 |pmc=1429605 |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2125.1979.tb00908.x|url= |accessdate=2014-09-19}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==
Nordazepam is a [[partial agonist]] at the [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor]], which makes it less potent than other benzodiazepines, particularly in its amnesic and muscle-relaxing effects.<ref name="pmid2886589">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gobbi M, Barone D, Mennini T, Garattini S |title=Diazepam and desmethyldiazepam differ in their affinities and efficacies at 'central' and 'peripheral' benzodiazepine receptors |journal=J.

== Pregnancy and nursing mothers ==
Nordazepam, like other benzodiazepines, easily crosses the placental barrier, so the drug should not be administered during the first trimester of pregnancy.<ref name="pmid6144535">{{cite journal |vauthors=Olive G, Rey E |title=[Benzodiazepines and pregnancy.

Since nordazepam and other benzodiazepines are excreted in breast milk, the molecule should not be administered to mothers who are breastfeeding. Discontinuing of breast-feeding is indicated for regular intake by the mother.<ref name="pmid2105100">{{cite journal |vauthors=Dusci LJ, Good SM, Hall RW, Ilett KF |title=Excretion of diazepam and its metabolites in human milk during withdrawal from combination high dose diazepam and oxazepam |journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=123–6 | date=January 1990 |pmid=2105100 |pmc=1380071 |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2125.1990.tb03612.x|url= |accessdate=2014-09-19}}</ref>

==Recreational use==
{{See also|Benzodiazepine misuse}}
Nordazepam and other sedative-hypnotic drugs are detected frequently in cases of people suspected of driving under the influence of drugs. Many drivers have blood levels far exceeding the therapeutic dose range, suggesting benzodiazepines are commonly used in doses higher than the recommended doses.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Jones AW |author2=Holmgren A |author3=Kugelberg FC.  |date=April 2007 | title = Concentrations of scheduled prescription drugs in blood of impaired drivers: considerations for interpreting the results | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 248–60 | pmid = 17417081 | journal = Ther Drug Monit. | doi = 10.1097/FTD.0b013e31803d3c04}}</ref>
