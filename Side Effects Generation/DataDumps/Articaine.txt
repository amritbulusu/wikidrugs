'''Articaine''' is a dental [[amide]]-type [[local anesthetic]]. It is the most widely used local anesthetic in a number of European countries<ref name="ReferenceA">Oertel R, Ebert U, Rahn R, Kirch W. Clinical pharmacokinetics of articaine. Clin Pharmacokinet. 1997 Dec;33(6):418.</ref> and is available in many countries around. It is the only local anaesthetic to contain a [[Thiophene|thiophene ring]], meaning it can be described as 'thiophenic'; this conveys lipid solubility.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Snoeck|first=Marc|date=2012-06-05|title=Articaine: a review of its use for local and regional anesthesia|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3417979/|journal=Local and regional anesthesia|volume=5|pages=23–33|doi=10.2147/LRA.S16682|issn=1178-7112|pmc=3417979|pmid=22915899}}</ref>

==History==
This drug was first synthesized by Rusching in 1969,<ref name="Malamed SF p. 71">Malamed SF. Handbook of local anaesthesia, p. 71, 5th ed. St. Louis, Mosby; 2004.</ref> and brought to the market in Germany by [[Hoechst AG]], a life-sciences German company, under the brand name Ultracain. This drug was originally referred to as "carticaine" until 1984.<ref name="Malamed SF p. 71" />

In 1983 it was brought into the North American market, to Canada, under the name Ultracaine for dental use, manufactured in Germany and distributed by [[Hoechst-Marion-Roussel]]. This brand is currently manufactured in Germany by [[Sanofi-Aventis]] and distributed in North America by [[Hansamed]] Limited (since 1999).  After Ultracaine's patent protection expired, new generic versions arrived to the Canadian market: (in order of appearance) Septanest ([[Septodont]]), Astracaine, (originally by [[AstraZeneca]] and now a [[Dentsply]] product), Zorcaine ([[Carestream Health]]/[[Kodak]]) and Orabloc (Pierrel).

It was approved by the FDA in April 2000, and became available in the United States of America two months later under the brand name [[Septocaine]], an [[Local anesthetic with vasoconstrictor|anesthetic/vasoconstrictor combination]] with Epinephrine 1:100,000 (trade name [[Septodont]]). Zorcaine became available there a few years later, also. Articadent ([[Dentsply]]) became available in the United States in October 2010.  The three brands currently available in the United States are all manufactured for these companies by Novocol Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Canada). Ubistesin and Ubistesin Forte ([[3M ESPE]]) are also widely used in the United States and Europe. Orabloc ([[Pierrel]]) is aseptically manufactured and was approved by the FDA in 2010, became available in Canada in 2011, and in Europe from 2013.

Articaine is currently available for the North American dental market:

==Structure and metabolism==
The amide structure of articaine is similar to that of other local anesthetics, but its molecular structure differs through the presence of a [[thiophene]] ring instead of a benzene ring. Articaine is exceptional because it contains an additional [[ester]] group that is metabolized by esterases in blood and tissue.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> The elimination of articaine is exponential with a half-life of 20 minutes.<ref>HornkeI, Eckert HG, Rupp W. Pharnakokinetik und Metabolismus von Articain nach intramuskularer Injektion am mannlichen Probanden. Dtsch Z Mund Kiefer Gesichts Chir 1984; 8:67-71</ref><ref>Kirch W, Kitteringham N, Lambers G, et al. Die klinische Pharmakokinetik von Articain nach intraoraler und intramuskularer Application. Schweiz Monatsschr Zahnheilkd 1983; 93: 713-9</ref> Since articaine is hydrolized very quickly in the blood, the risk of systemic intoxication seems to be lower than with other anesthetics, especially if repeated injection is performed.<ref>Oertel R, Ebert U, Rahn R, Kirch W. Clinical pharmacokinetics of articaine. Clin Pharmacokinet. 1997 Dec;33(6):420.</ref>

==Clinical use==
Articaine is used for pain control.  Like other local anesthetic drugs, articaine causes a transient and completely reversible state of anesthesia (loss of sensation) during (dental) procedures.<ref>Malamed SF. Handbook of local anaesthesia, p. 3, 5th ed. St. Louis, Mosby; 2004.</ref>

In [[dentistry]], articaine is used mainly for infiltration injections. Articaine, while not proven, has been associated with higher risk of nerve damage when used as a [[Local anesthetic nerve block|block]] technique.<ref>Pogrel MA. Permanent nerve damage from inferior alveolar nerve blocks--an update to include articaine. J Calif Dent Assoc. 2007 Apr;35(4):271-3.</ref> However, articaine  is able to penetrate dense cortical bone &mdash; as found in the lower jaw (mandible) &mdash; more than most other local anaesthetics.

In people with [[hypokalemic sensory overstimulation]], lidocaine is not very effective, but articaine works well.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Segal MM, Rogers GF, Needleman HL, Chapman CA |title= Hypokalemic sensory overstimulation |journal= J Child Neurol |volume=22 |issue=12 |pages=1408–10 |year=2007 |doi=10.1177/0883073807307095 |pmid=18174562}}</ref>

Studies comparing lidocaine and articaine found that articaine is more effective than lidocaine in anaesthetising the posterior first molar region.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = The efficacy and safety of articaine versus lignocaine in dental treatments: a meta-analysis.|last = Katyal|first = V.|date = 2010|journal = J Dent; 38:307–17.|doi = |pmid = }}</ref> Articaine has been found to be 3.81 times more likely than lidocaine to produce successful anaesthesia when used for infiltration injections. However, there is no evidence to support the use of articaine over lidocaine for inferior alveolar nerve blocks.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The pulpal anesthetic efficacy of articaine versus lidocaine in dentistry: a meta-analysis|journal = Journal of the American Dental Association (1939)|date = 2011-05-01|issn = 1943-4723|pmid = 21531931|pages = 493–504|volume = 142|issue = 5|first = Ryan G.|last = Brandt|first2 = Patricia F.|last2 = Anderson|first3 = Neville J.|last3 = McDonald|first4 = Woosung|last4 = Sohn|first5 = Mathilde C.|last5 = Peters|doi=10.14219/jada.archive.2011.0219}}</ref> Furthermore, articaine has been demonstrated to be superior to lidocaine for use of supplementary infiltration following persistent pain despite a successful inferior dental nerve block with lidocaine.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Does Articaine Provide an Advantage over Lidocaine in Patients with Symptomatic Irreversible Pulpitis?

==Contraindications==
* Patients allergic to amide-type anesthetics
* Patients allergic to metabisulfites (preservative present in the formula to extend the life of the epinephrine). There is no cross-allergenicity between sulfites (preservatives), sulfur, and the "sulfa"-type antibiotics.<ref>Malamed SF. Handbook of local anaesthesia, p. 320, 5th ed. St. Louis, Mosby; 2004.</ref>
* Patients with idiopathic or congenital methemoglobinemia <ref name="Malamed SF p. 65">Malamed SF. Handbook of local anaesthesia, p. 65, 6th ed. St. Louis, Mosby; 2013.</ref>
* Patients with hemoglobinopathies (Sickle Cell Disease) <ref name="Malamed SF p. 65"/>
* Articaine is not contraindicated in patients with sulfa allergies; there is no cross-allergenicity between articaine's sulphur-bearing [[thiophene|thiophene ring ]] and sulfonamides.<ref>Becker, DE; Reed, KL: Essentials of Local Anesthetic Pharmacology. ''Anesth Prog'' 53:98-109 2006</ref>

[[Methylparaben]] is no longer present in any dental local anesthetic formula available in North America.<ref name="Malamed SF p. 73">Malamed SF. Handbook of local anaesthesia, p. 73, 5th ed. St. Louis, Mosby; 2004.</ref>

[[Methemoglobinemia]] is not a concern in the dental practice, due to the small volumes of articaine used.<ref name="Malamed SF p. 73" />

==Paresthesia controversy==
Paresthesia, a short-to-long-term numbness or altered sensation affecting a nerve, is a well-known complication of injectable local anesthetics and has been present even before articaine was available.<ref>Pogrel MA, Bryan J, Regezi J. Nerve damage associated with inferior alveolar nerve blocks. J Am Dent Assoc. 1995 Aug;126(8):1150-5.</ref><ref>Pogrel MA, Thamby S. Permanent nerve involvement resulting from inferior alveolar nerve blocks. J Am Dent Assoc. 2000 Jul;131(7):901-7. Erratum in: J Am Dent Assoc 2000 Oct;131(10):1418.</ref>

An article by Haas and Lennon published in 1993<ref>Haas DA, Lennon D. A 21 year retrospective study of reports of paresthesia following local anesthetic administration. J Can Dent Assoc. 1995 Apr;61(4):319-20, 323-6, 329-30.</ref> seems to be the original source for the controversy surrounding articaine.This paper analyzed 143 cases reported in to the Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario (RCDSO) over a 21-year period. The results from their analysis seemed to indicate that 4% local anesthetics had a higher incidence of causing [[paresthesia]], an undesirable temporary or permanent complication, after the injection. The authors concluded that “...the overall incidence of paresthesia following local anesthetic administration for non-surgical procedures in dentistry in Ontario is very low, with only 14 cases being reported out of an estimated 11,000,000 injections in 1993. However if paresthesia does occur, the results of this study are consistent with the suggestion that it is significantly more likely to do so if either articaine or [[prilocaine]] is used.”

In another paper by the same authors,<ref>Haas DA, Lennon D. A review of local anesthetic-induced paraesthesia in Ontario in 1994. J Dent Res 1996; 75(Special Issue):247.</ref> 19 reported paresthesia cases in Ontario for 1994 were reviewed, concluding that the incidence of paresthesia was 2.05 per million injections of 4% anesthetic drugs. Another follow up study by Miller and Haas published in 2000,<ref>Miller PA, Haas DA. Incidence of local anesthetic-induced neuropathies in Ontario from 1994–1998. J Dent Res 2000; 79 (Special Issue):627.</ref> concluded that the incidence of paresthesia from either prilocaine or articaine (the only two 4% drugs in the dental market) was close to 1:500,000 injections. (An average dentist gives around 1,800 injections in a year.<ref>Haas DA, Lennon D Local anaesthetic use by dentists in Ontario. J Can Dent Assoc. 1995 Apr;61(4):297-304</ref>)

Almost all recorded cases of long-term numbness or altered sensation ([[paresthesia]]) seem only to be present when this anesthetic is used for dental use (no PubMed references for paresthesia with articaine for other medical specialties), and only affect, in the vast majority of the reports, the lingual nerve.

Nonetheless, direct damage to the nerve caused by 4% drugs has never been scientifically proven.<ref>Malamed SF. Local anesthetics: dentistry's most important drugs, clinical update 2006. J Calif Dent Assoc. 2006 Dec;34(12):971-6</ref>

Some research points to needle trauma as the cause of the paresthesia events.<ref>Pogrel MA, Permanent nerve damage from inferior alveolar nerve blocks—an update to include articaine. J Calif Dent Assoc. 2007 Apr;35(4):271-3</ref><ref>Hoffmeister B, Morphological changes of peripheral nerves following intraneural injection of local anesthetic, Dtsch Zahnarztl Z. 1991 Dec;46(12):828-30</ref>
