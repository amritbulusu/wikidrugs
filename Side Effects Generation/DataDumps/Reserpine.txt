'''Reserpine''' (also known by trade names '''Raudixin''', '''Serpalan''', '''Serpasil''') is an [[indole]] [[alkaloid]],<ref name="indole-alkaloid">[http://waynesword.palomar.edu/chemid2.htm#indole "Indole Alkaloids"] ''Major Types Of Chemical Compounds In Plants & Animals Part II: Phenolic Compounds, Glycosides & Alkaloids.''

Copyright © 2001-05 Columbia University Press.</ref> The antihypertensive actions of reserpine are a result of its ability to deplete [[catecholamine]]s (among other [[monoamine neurotransmitters]]) from [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] nerve endings. These substances are normally involved in controlling heart rate, force of cardiac contraction and peripheral vascular resistance.<ref name="veterinary1">Forney, Barbara.

Reserpine-mediated depletion of monoamine [[neurotransmitter]]s in the [[synapse]]s is often cited as evidence to the theory that depletion of the monoamine neurotransmitters causes subsequent [[clinical depression|depression]] in humans (c.f. [[monoamine hypothesis]]). However, this claim is not without controversy. The reserpine-induced depression is considered by some researchers to be a myth, while others claim that teas made out of the plant roots containing reserpine have a calming, sedative action that can actually be considered ''anti''depressant'''.'''<ref>{{Cite journal

Moreover, reserpine has a peripheral action in many parts of the body, resulting in a preponderance of the effects of the [[cholinergic]] part of the [[autonomous nervous system]] on the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|GI tract]], [[Smooth muscle tissue|smooth muscles]], [[blood vessel]]s, etc.

==Mechanism of action==
Reserpine irreversibly blocks the [[vesicular monoamine transporter]] (VMAT).<ref>{{Cite journal

}}</ref> This normally transports free intracellular [[norepinephrine]], [[serotonin]], and [[dopamine]] in the presynaptic nerve terminal into presynaptic vesicles for subsequent release into the [[synaptic cleft]] ("[[exocytosis]]"). Unprotected neurotransmitters are metabolized by [[monoamine oxidase|MAO]] (as well as by [[COMT]]) in the cytoplasm and consequently never excite the post-synaptic cell. Thus, reserpine decreases metabolic rate of monoamine neurotransmitters; but also decreases magnitude of monoamine release.<ref>{{cite journal|pmc=4183197 | pmid=21272013 | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05906.x | volume=1216 | title=VMAT2: a dynamic regulator of brain monoaminergic neuronal function interacting with drugs of abuse | year=2011 | journal=Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. | pages=86–98 | last1 = Eiden | first1 = LE | last2 = Weihe | first2 = E}}</ref>

It may take the body days to weeks to replenish the depleted VMAT, so reserpine's effects are long-lasting.

This depletion of dopamine can lead to drug-induced parkinsonism.<ref name="Barcelos 2010">{{Cite journal

==Biosynthetic pathway==
Tryptophan is the starting material in the biosynthetic pathway of reserpine, and is converted to tryptamine by tryptophan decarboxylase enzyme. Tryptamine is combined with secologanin in the presence of strictosidine synthetase enzyme and yields strictosidine. Various enzymatic conversion reactions lead to the synthesis of reserpine from strictosidine.<ref>Ramawat et al, 1999.{{cite book|author1=Ramawat KG |author2=Rachnana Sharma |author3=Suri SS |title=Medicinal Plants in Biotechnology- Secondary metabolites 2nd edition 2007 | editor=Ramawat, KG. |editor2=Merillon, JM.|publisher=Oxford and IBH, India|pages=66–367|ISBN=978-1-57808-428-9}}</ref>

Reserpine was isolated in 1952 from the dried root of ''[[Rauwolfia serpentina]]'' (Indian snakeroot),<ref name="mercksource">[http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands.jspzQzpgzEzzSzppdocszSzuszSzcommonzSzdorlandszSzdorlandzSzdmd_r_03zPzhtm#1093125 Rauwolfia] Dorlands Medical Dictionary.

Reserpine almost irreversibly blocks the uptake (and storage) of [[norepinephrine]] (i.e. [[noradrenaline]]) and [[dopamine]] into synaptic vesicles by inhibiting the [[vesicular monoamine transporter 2]] (VMAT2).<ref name="VMAT">{{cite journal | author = Schuldiner S. | year = 1993 | title =  Reserpine binding to a vesicular amine transporter expressed in Chinese hamster ovary fibroblasts| url = | journal = J.

Reserpine has been discontinued in the UK for some years due to its numerous interactions and side effects.

Reserpine was also highly influential in promoting the thought of a [[biogenic amine]] hypothesis of depression&nbsp;— see Everett & Tolman, 1959.

It was previously used to treat symptoms of [[dyskinesia]] in patients suffering from [[Huntington's disease]]<ref name=pharmnemonics>{{Cite book | author=Shen, Howard | title=Illustrated Pharmacology Memory Cards: PharMnemonics | year=2008 | publisher=Minireview | isbn=1-59541-101-1 | page=11}}</ref>, but alternative medications are preferred today.<ref>Bhomraj Thanvi, Nelson Lo, and Tom Robinson: Levodopa‐induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease: clinical features, pathogenesis, prevention and treatment.Postgrad Med J. 2007 Jun; 83(980): 384–388.
PMCID: PMC2600052. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2600052/</ref>

In some countries reserpine is still available as part of combination drugs for the treatment of hypertension, in most cases they contain also a diuretic and/or a vasodilator like [[hydralazine]]. These combinations are currently regarded as second choice drugs.

The daily dose of reserpine in antihypertensive treatment is as low as 0.1 to 0.25&nbsp;mg. The use of reserpine as an antipsychotic drug had been nearly completely abandoned, but more recently it made a comeback as adjunctive treatment, in combination with other antipsychotics, so that more refractory patients get dopamine blockade from the other antipsychotic, and dopamine depletion from reserpine. Doses for this kind of adjunctive goal can be kept low, resulting in better tolerability. Originally, doses of 0.5&nbsp;mg to 40&nbsp;mg daily were used to treat psychotic diseases.

Doses in excess of 3&nbsp;mg daily often required use of an anticholinergic drug to combat excessive cholinergic activity in many parts of the body as well as parkinsonism. For adjunctive treatment, doses are typically kept at or below 0.25&nbsp;mg twice a day.

===Veterinary and other===
Reserpine may be used as a sedative for horses.

Another frequent use of reserpine is in the field of mass spectrometry where it is widely used as a reference standard owing to its availability, ease of ionization under electrospray conditions and stability in solution.

Reserpine is used as a long-acting tranquilizer to subdue excitable or difficult horses and has been used illicitly for the sedation of show horses, for-sale horses, and in other circumstances where a "quieter" horse might be desired.<ref>Forney B. Reserpine for veterinary use. Available at http://www.wedgewoodpetrx.com/learning-center/professional-monographs/reserpine-for-veterinary-use.html.</ref>

Reserpine is no longer available in the United Kingdom; however it is still available in the United States

==Side effects==
At doses of less than 0.2&nbsp;mg/day, reserpine has few side effects, the most common of which is nasal congestion.<ref name="pmid3350594">{{cite journal |vauthors=Curb JD, Schneider K, Taylor JO, Maxwell M, Shulman N |title=Antihypertensive drug side effects in the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program |journal=Hypertension |volume=11 |issue=3 Pt 2 |pages=II51–5 |year=1988 |pmid=3350594 |doi=10.1161/01.hyp.11.3_pt_2.ii51}}</ref>

There has been much concern about reserpine causing depression leading to suicide. However, this was reported in uncontrolled studies using doses averaging 0.5&nbsp;mg per day.<ref name="pmid13629798">{{cite journal |vauthors=QUETSCH RM, ACHOR RW, LITIN EM, FAUCETT RL |title=Depressive reactions in hypertensive patients; a comparison of those treated with Rauwolfia and those receiving no specific antihypertensive treatment |journal=Circulation |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=366–75 |year=1959 |pmid=13629798 |doi=10.1161/01.cir.19.3.366}}</ref><ref name="pmid13304797">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lemieux G, Davignon A, Genest J |title=Depressive states during Rauwolfia therapy for arterial hypertension; a report of 30 cases |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=74 |issue=7 |pages=522–6 |year=1956 |pmid=13304797 |doi= |pmc=1823144}}</ref>

Reserpine can cause: nasal congestion, nausea, vomiting, weight gain, gastric intolerance, gastric ulceration (due to increased cholinergic activity in gastric tissue and impaired mucosal quality), stomach cramps and diarrhea are noted. The drug causes hypotension and bradycardia and may worsen asthma. Congested nose and erectile dysfunction are other consequences of alpha-blockade.<ref name="Giannini">AJ Giannini, HR Black. Psychiatric, Psychogenic, and Somatopsychic Disorders Handbook. Garden City, NY. Medical Examination Publishing, 1978. Pg. 233. {{ISBN|0-87488-596-5}}.</ref> 

Depression can occur at any dose and may be severe enough to lead to suicide. Other central effects are a high incidence of drowsiness, dizziness, and nightmares. Parkinsonism occurs in a dose dependent manner. General weakness or fatigue is quite often encountered. 

High dose studies in rodents found reserpine to cause fibroadenoma of the breast and malignant tumors of the seminal vesicles among others. Early suggestions that reserpine causes breast cancer in women (risk approximately doubled) were not confirmed. It may also cause [[hyperprolactinemia]].<ref name="Giannini"/>

Reserpine passes into [[breast milk]] and is harmful to breast-fed infants, and should therefore be avoided during breastfeeding if possible.<ref name=kidsgrowth>[http://www.kidsgrowth.org/resources/articledetail.cfm?id=471 kidsgrowth.org --> Drugs and Other Substances in Breast Milk] Retrieved on June 19, 2009</ref>

It also produces a dangerous decline in blood pressure at doses needed for treatment.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pinel|first=John P.J.|title=Biopsychology|date=2011|publisher=Allyn & Bacon|location=Boston|isbn=978-0205832569|pages=469|edition=8th}}</ref>
