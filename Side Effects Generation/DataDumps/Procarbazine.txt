<!-- DEfinition and medical uses -->
'''Procarbazine''' is a [[chemotherapy medication]] used for the treatment of [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]] and [[brain cancers]].<ref name=AHFS2016/> For Hodgkin's it is often used together with [[mechlorethamine]], [[vincristine]], and [[prednisone]] while for brain cancers such as [[glioblastoma multiforme]] it is used with [[lomustine]] and [[vincristine]].<ref name=AHFS2016/> It is typically taken by mouth.<ref name=AHFS2016>{{cite web|title=Procarbazine Hydrochloride|url=https://www.drugs.com/monograph/procarbazine-hydrochloride.html|publisher=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=8 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221013334/https://www.drugs.com/monograph/procarbazine-hydrochloride.html|archivedate=21 December 2016|df=}}</ref>

<!-- Society and culture -->
Procarbazine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1969.<ref name=AHFS2016/> It is on the [[World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines]], the most effective and safe medicines needed in a [[health system]].<ref name=WHO19th>{{cite web|title=WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (19th List)|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/EML_2015_FINAL_amended_NOV2015.pdf?ua=1|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=8 December 2016|date=April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213052708/http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/EML_2015_FINAL_amended_NOV2015.pdf?ua=1|archivedate=13 December 2016|df=}}</ref> In the United Kingdom a month of treatment cost the [[NHS]] 450 to 750 pounds.<ref name=BNF69>{{cite book|title=British national formulary : BNF 69|date=2015|publisher=British Medical Association|isbn=9780857111562|page=606|edition=69}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
When used to treat [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]], it is often delivered as part of the [[BEACOPP]] regimen that includes [[bleomycin]], [[etoposide]], [[adriamycin]], [[cyclophosphamide]], [[vincristine]] (tradename Oncovin), [[prednisone]], and procarbazine. The first combination chemotherapy developed for Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), [[MOPP]] also included procarbazine ([[ABVD]] has supplanted MOPP as standard first line treatment for HL, with BEACOPP as an alternative for advanced/unfavorable HL). Alternatively, when used to treat certain brain tumors (malignant gliomas), it is often dosed as PCV when combined with [[lomustine]] (often called CCNU) and vincristine.

Dose should be adjusted for kidney disease or liver disease.

==Side effects==
Very common (greater than 10% of people experience them) adverse effects include loss of appetite. nausea, and vomiting.<ref name=UKlabel2014/>  Other side effects of unknown frequency include [[leucopenia|reduction in leukocytes]], [[thrombocytopenia|reduction in platelets]], [[Neutropenia|reduction in neutrophils]], which can lead to increased infections including lung infections; severe allergy-like reactions that can lead to [[angioedema]] and skin reactions; lethargy; liver complications including [[jaundice]] and abnormal liver function tests; reproductive effects including [[Azoospermia|reduction in sperm count]] and [[ovarian failure]].<ref name=UKlabel2014/>

When combined with [[ethanol]], procarbazine may cause a [[disulfiram]]-like reaction in some people.<ref name=UKlabel2014/> 

It weakly inhibits MAO in the gastrointestinal system, so it can cause hypertensive crises if associated with the ingestion of tyramine-rich foods such as aged cheeses; this appears to be rare.<ref name=UKlabel2014/> 

Procarbazine rarely causes [[chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy]],<ref>{{cite book | title = Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine | edition = 6th | chapter = Nonmetastatic Complications | author1 = Lisa M.

==Pharmacology==
Its [[mechanism of action]] is not fully understood. Metabolism yields azo-procarbazine and [[hydrogen peroxide]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} which results in the breaking of DNA strands.
