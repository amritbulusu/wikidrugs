'''Indazole''', also called isoindazole, is a [[heterocyclic]] [[aromatic]] [[organic compound]].  This [[bicyclic]] compound consists of the fusion of [[benzene]] and [[pyrazole]].

Indazole derivatives display a broad variety of biological activities.

Indazoles are rare in nature. The [[alkaloid]]s [[nigellicine]], [[nigeglanine]], and [[nigellidine]] are indazoles. Nigellicine was isolated from the widely distributed plant ''[[Nigella sativa]]'' L. (black cumin). Nigeglanine was isolated from extracts of ''[[Nigella glandulifera]]''. 

The [[Davis–Beirut reaction]] can generate 2H-indazoles.

==Some derivatives==
; indazole-3-carboxylic acid: 
Having a [[carboxylic acid]] group on carbon 3. Can be further modified to [[lonidamine]] & [[tolnidamine]].
