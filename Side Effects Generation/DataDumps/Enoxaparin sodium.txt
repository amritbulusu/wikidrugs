==Medical uses==
* Treatment of unstable [[Angina pectoris|angina]] (UA) and non-Q-wave [[myocardial infarction]] (NQMI), administered concurrently with [[aspirin]]
* DVT prophylaxis in knee replacement surgery
* DVT prophylaxis in hip replacement surgery
* DVT prophylaxis in abdominal surgery
* Treatment of DVT with or without pulmonary embolism 
* Treatment of DVT inpatient, with [[ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction]] (STEMI)<ref name=":0" />

===Monitoring===
Enoxaparin has predictable absorption, [[bioavailability]], and distribution therefore monitoring is not typically done. However, there are instances where monitoring may be beneficial for special populations, for example individuals with [[renal insufficiency|kidney insufficiency]] or those that are obese. In this case, [[Low molecular weight heparin|anti-Xa units]] can be measured and dosing adjusted accordingly.<ref name=":0" />

===Reversal agent===
[[Protamine]] sulfate is less effective at reversing enoxaparin compared to [[heparin]], with a maximum neutralization of approximately 60% of the anti-factor Xa effect.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Lovenox® (enoxaparin sodium injection) for subcutaneous and intravenous use Prescribing Information |url=http://products.sanofi.us/lovenox/lovenox.html |website=products.sanofi.us |accessdate=2015-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023072153/http://products.sanofi.us/lovenox/lovenox.html |archivedate=2015-10-23 |df= }}</ref>

===Pregnancy===
*Enoxaparin is a FDA [[pregnancy category]] B drug which means enoxaparin is not expected to cause harm to an unborn baby when used during pregnancy. This statement is based on reproductive studies involving pregnant rats and rabbits. No [[birth defects]] or toxic effects to an unborn fetus due to enoxaparin were observed during these animals studies. However a human's response to enoxaparin might be different than that of a small animal, therefore enoxaparin should be used during pregnancy only if there is a definite need.<ref name=":0" />
* Enoxaparin does not cross the placenta therefore it is unlikely an unborn baby would be exposed to it.<ref name=":0" />
* Some fetal deaths have been reported by women who used enoxaparin during pregnancy, but it is unclear if enoxaparin caused these deaths.<ref name=":0" />
* Pregnant woman on enoxaparin should be monitored on a regular basis for bleeding and/or "excessive anticoagulation" especially when the delivery date is approaching. The risk of hemorrhage is higher during delivery if the person is still using enoxaparin and this could endanger the life of the baby and/or the mom.<ref name=":0" />
* The multiple-dose vials of the brand name enoxaparin (Lovenox) contain 15&nbsp;mg [[benzyl alcohol]] per 1 mL as a preservative. Premature infants who have been given large amounts of benzyl alcohol (99–405&nbsp;mg/kg/day) have experienced "gasping syndrome".<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Gasping Syndrome and Benzyl Alcohol Poisoning|url = http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJM198211253072206|journal = New England Journal of Medicine|date = 1982-11-25|issn = 0028-4793|pmid = 7133084|pages = 1384–1388|volume = 307|issue = 22|doi = 10.1056/NEJM198211253072206|first = Juan|last = Gershanik|first2 = Betty|last2 = Boecler|first3 = Harry|last3 = Ensley|first4 = Sharon|last4 = McCloskey|first5 = William|last5 = George}}</ref>
* Although enoxaparin is used to prevent blood clots it is necessary to remember that pregnancy alone can raise a woman's risk of clotting.<ref name=":0" />

== Pharmacology ==

=== Mechanism of action ===
Enoxaparin binds to and potentiates [[antithrombin]] (a circulating anticoagulant) to form a complex that irreversibly inactivates [[Coagulation|clotting]] [[factor Xa]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Koda-Kimble and Young's Applied Therapeutics: The Clinical Use of Drugs|last = Alldredge|first = Brian|publisher = |year = |isbn = 1-60913-713-2|location = |pages = 347–348|edition = Tenth|last2 = Corelli|first2 = Robin|last3 = Ernst|first3 = Michael|last4 = Guglielmo|last5 = Jacobson|first4 = B. Joseph|first5 = Pamela|last6 = Kradjan|first6 = Wayne|last7 = Williams|first7 = Bradley}}</ref> It has less activity against [[factor IIa]] (thrombin) compared to unfractionated heparin (UFH) due to its low molecular weight.<ref>Trevor, Anthony J., Bertram G. Katzung, and Susan B. Masters. ''Basic & clinical pharmacology''. McGraw-Hill Medical, 2012.</ref>

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Absorption: Bioavailability (subcutaneous injection) ~ 100%<ref name=":2" />

Distribution: Volume of distribution (anti-Factor Xa activity) = 4.3 liters<ref name=":2" />

Metabolism: Enoxaparin is metabolized in the liver into low molecular weight species by either or both desulfation and depolymerization.<ref name=":2" />

Elimination: A single dose of a subcutaneous injection of enoxaparin has an elimination half-life of 4.5 hours.<ref name=":2" />  Approximately 10%-40% of the active and inactive fragments from a single dose are excreted by the kidneys.<ref name=":2" />  Dose adjustments based on kidney function are necessary in persons with reduced kidney function.<ref name=":2" />

== Drug class ==
Enoxaparin belongs to the class of drugs known as low molecular weight heparins.  Other drugs in this class include [[dalteparin]], [[fondaparinux]] and [[tinzaparin]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = LowMolecularWeightHeparins|url = http://livertox.nih.gov/LowMolecularWeightHeparins.htm|website = livertox.nih.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-05|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150828060257/http://livertox.nih.gov/LowMolecularWeightHeparins.htm|archivedate = 2015-08-28|df = }}</ref>
