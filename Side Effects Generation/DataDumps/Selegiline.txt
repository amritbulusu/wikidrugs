'''Selegiline''', also known as '''<small>L</small>-deprenyl''', is a [[substituted phenethylamine]]. At normal clinical doses, it is a selective irreversible [[MAOI#Mode of action|MAO-B inhibitor]]. In larger doses it loses its specificity and also inhibits MAO-A.
It is available in pill form under many brand names<ref name=DrugNames>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/international/selegiline.html|work=Drugs.com |title=Selegiline|accessdate=Feb 7, 2016}}</ref> and is used to reduce symptoms in early-stage [[Parkinson's disease]]. A [[transdermal patch]] (brand name, '''Emsam''') is used to treat [[major depressive disorder|depression]].

==Medical uses==
For all human uses and all forms, selegiline is [[pregnancy category]] C,<ref name=PillLabel/><ref name=PatchLabel/> meaning that caution is in order because studies in pregnant laboratory animals have shown an adverse effect on the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, but that the drug's potential benefits may nonetheless warrant use of the drug in some pregnant women.

=== Parkinson's disease ===
In its pill form, selegiline is used to treat symptoms of [[Parkinson's disease]].<ref name=PillLabel>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2008/019334s019s020lbl.pdf Selegiline oral label].

A quantitative review published in 2015 found that for the pooled results of the pivotal trials, the [[number needed to treat]] (a sign of [[effect size]], so a low number is better) for the patch for symptom reduction was 11, and for remission, was 9.<ref name=QuantRev2013/>  The [[number needed to harm]] (inverse of the NNT, a high number here is better) ranged from 387 for sexual side effects to 7 for application site reaction.<ref name=QuantRev2013/> With regard to the likelihood to be helped or harmed (LHH), the analysis showed that the selegiline patch was 3.6 times as likely to lead to a remission vs. a discontinuation due to side effects;  the LHH for remission vs. incidence of insomnia was 2.1; the LHH for remission vs. discontinuation due to insomnia was 32.7.  The LHH for remission vs insomnia and sexual dysfunction were both very low.<ref name=QuantRev2013/>

==Adverse effects==
Side effects of the pill form include, in decreasing order of frequency, nausea, hallucinations, confusion, depression, loss of balance, insomnia, increased involuntary movements, agitation, arrhythmia, slow heart rate, delusions, hypertension, new or increased [[angina pectoris]], and [[syncope (medicine)|syncope]].<ref name=PillLabel/>

The main side effects of the patch form for depression included application-site reactions, insomnia, diarrhea, and sore throat.<ref name=PatchLabel/>

Both forms of the drug carry warnings about [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor#Hypertensive Crisis .26 Tyramine|food restrictions]], to avoid [[hypertensive crisis]] that are associated with MAO inhibitors.<ref name=PillLabel/><ref name=PatchLabel/>  The patch form of the drug was created in part to overcome the issues with food restrictions: the clinical trials did not include food restrictions, and no hypertensive crisis during the course of them. Additionally, in [[post-marketing surveillance]] from April 2006 to October 2010, only 13 self-reports of possible hypertensive events or hypertension were made out of 29,141 exposures to the drug, and none were accompanied by objective clinical data.<ref name=QuantRev2013/> The lowest dose of the patch method of delivery, 6&nbsp;mg/24 hours, does not require any dietary restrictions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jessen|first=Lois|last2=Kovalick|first2=Lawrence J.|last3=Azzaro|first3=Albert J.|date=2017-04-22|title=The Selegiline Transdermal System (Emsam)|journal=Pharmacy and Therapeutics|volume=33|issue=4|pages=212–246|issn=1052-1372|pmc=2730099|pmid=19750165}}</ref> Higher doses of the patch and oral formulations, whether in combination with the older non-selective MAOIs or in combination with the [[Reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A|reversible MAO-A inhibitor]] [[moclobemide]], require a low [[tyramine]] diet.<ref name="pmid9673855"/>

==Pharmacology==

===Protein binding===
Selegiline is a selective inhibitor of MAO-B; MAO-B metabolizes [[dopamine]] and [[phenylethylamine]].<ref name="Katzung, Bertram G 2004. page 453"/>

===Pharmacokinetics of the pill form===
Selegiline has a low oral [[bioavailability]], which increases to moderate when ingested together with a high-fat meal, the molecule being fat soluble.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=1535–40 |doi=10.1023/A:1016035730754 |year=1996 |last1=Barrett |first1=Jeffrey S. |last2=Szego |first2=Peter |last3=Rohatagi |first3=Shashank |last4=Morales |first4=Richard J. |last5=Dewitt |first5=Kimberly E. |last6=Rajewski |first6=Gregory |last7=Ireland |first7=Joyce |journal=Pharmaceutical Research |volume=13 |issue=10 |pmid=8899847 |title=Absorption and presystemic metabolism of selegiline hydrochloride at different regions in the gastrointestinal tract in healthy males}}</ref>

===Pharmacokinetics of the patch form===
Following application of the patch to humans, 25% to 30% of the selegiline content on average is delivered systemically over 24 hours (range approximately 10% to 40%).  Transdermal dosing results in significantly higher exposure to selegiline with significantly lower exposure for all metabolites when compared to oral dosing, due to extensive first-pass metabolism for the pill form and low first-pass metabolism for the patch form.  The site of application is not a significant factor in how the drug is distributed.   In humans, selegiline does not accumulate in the skin nor is it metabolized in the skin.<ref name=PatchLabel/>

When radiolabeled selegiline is given transdermally to laboratory animals, the drug is rapidly distributed to all body tissues and rapidly penetrates the [[blood–brain barrier]].<ref name=PatchLabel/>

==History==
Following the discovery that the [[tuberculosis]] (TB) drug [[iproniazid]] elevated the mood of people taking it for TB, and the subsequent discovery that the effect was likely due to inhibition of [[MAO]], many people and companies started trying to discover MAO inhibitors to use as antidepressants.  Selegiline was discovered by Z. Ecseri at the Hungarian drug company, Chinoin (part of [[Sanofi]] since 1993),<ref name=PL1993>Staff, The Pharma Letter. Sept 20, 1993 [http://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/sanofi-extends-holding-in-chinoin Sanofi Extends Holding in Chinoin]</ref> which they called E-250.<ref name=MagyarChapter>Kalman Magyar.

In 1971, Knoll showed that selegiline selectively inhibits the B-isoform of monoamine oxidase ([[MAO-B]]) and proposed that it is unlikely to cause the infamous "cheese effect" ([[hypertensive emergency|hypertensive crisis]] resulting from consuming [[foods containing tyramine]]) that occurs with non-selective MAO inhibitors. A few years later, two Parkinson's disease researchers based in Vienna, Peter Riederer and Walther Birkmayer, realized that selegiline could be useful in Parkinson's disease. One of their colleagues, Prof. [[Moussa B.H. Youdim]], visited Knoll in Budapest and took selegiline from him to Vienna. In 1975, Birkmayer's group published the first paper on the effect of selegiline in Parkinson's disease.<ref name=healy/><ref name="pmid1172524">{{cite journal |vauthors=Birkmayer W, Riederer P, Youdim MB, Linauer W |title=The potentiation of the anti akinetic effect after L-dopa treatment by an inhibitor of MAO-B, Deprenil |journal=J.

The discovery that selegiline seemed to have a [[neuroprotection]] effect in Parkinson's disease led to widespread speculation in the 1970s that it could be useful as an [[anti-aging]] drug.<ref name=HG2002/>

In 1987 Somerset Pharmaceuticals in New Jersey, which had acquired the US rights to develop selegiline, filed a [[new drug application]] (NDA) with the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] to market the drug for PD in the US.<ref name=MylanHist>John T.

In the 1990s, J. Alexander Bodkin at [[McLean Hospital]], an affiliate of [[Harvard Medical School]], began a collaboration with Somerset to develop delivery of selegiline via a [[transdermal]] patch in order to avoid the well known [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor#Hypertensive Crisis .26 Tyramine|dietary restrictions of MAO inhibitors]].<ref name=HG2002>{{cite web |url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2002/11.07/11-patch.html |title=Bodkin is Patching up Depression |author=William J.

==Research==
A selegiline transdermal patch was  tested for its effectiveness in treating [[ADHD]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Selegiline in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children: a double blind and randomized trial|journal = Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry|date = 1 August 2003|issn = 0278-5846|pmid = 12921918|pages = 841–845|volume = 27|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/S0278-5846(03)00117-9|first = Shahin|last = Akhondzadeh|first2 = Reza|last2 = Tavakolian|first3 = Rozita|last3 = Davari-Ashtiani|first4 = Fariba|last4 = Arabgol|first5 = Homayoun|last5 = Amini}}</ref>

==Society and culture==
Due to the structural similarity to amphetamine, selegiline has been classified as a [[controlled substance]] in [[Japan]] and thus can only be obtained with a [[Medical prescription|prescription]] or special government license. Amphetamine and methamphetamine are illegal in the country.

In ''[[E for Ecstasy]]''<ref>Saunders, N., & Heron, L., (1993) ''E for Ecstasy'' (Paperback), N. Saunders, London. ({{ISBN|0950162884}}){{Page needed|date=January 2012}}</ref> (a book examining the uses of the street drug [[Methylenedioxymethamphetamine|ecstasy]] in the UK)  the writer, activist and ecstasy advocate [[Nicholas Saunders (activist)|Nicholas Saunders]] highlighted test results showing that certain consignments of the drug also contained selegiline. Consignments of ecstasy known as "Strawberry" contained what Saunders described as a "potentially dangerous combination of [[ketamine]], [[ephedrine]] and selegiline," as did a consignment of "Sitting Duck" Ecstasy tablets.<ref>See: [http://ecstasy.org/testing/pillstilJuly.html] for details online.</ref>

In the US, selegiline is available by prescription but is not scheduled as a controlled substance.

==Veterinary use==
Selegiline (brand name '''Anipryl''') is also used (at extremely high dosages relative to humans) in [[veterinary medicine]] to treat the symptoms of [[Cushing's disease]] and cognitive dysfunction (Canine Cognitive Dysfunction)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content.plx?P=A&A=2549|title=Canine Cognitive Dysfunction|author=Lundgren, Becky|publisher=Veterinary Partner|accessdate=April 8, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lbah.com/cds.htm|title=Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome|publisher=Long Beach Animal Hospital|accessdate=April 8, 2011}}</ref> in [[dog]]s.<ref>http://www.petplace.com/drug-library/selegiline-hcl-anipryl/page1.aspx</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/vet/anipryl-tablets.html|title=Anipryl consumer information|publisher=Drugs.com Vet|accessdate=April 3, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lloydinc.com/pdfs/Endocrinology/Vol14_issue3_2004.pdf |title=Selegiline Treatment of Canine Pituitary-Dependent Hyperadrenocorticism|vauthors=Braddock JA, Church DB, Robertson ID |year=2004|publisher=Australian Veterinary Journal|accessdate=April 8, 2011}} ([[PDF]])</ref>
