==Medical uses==
The main use of linezolid is the treatment of severe infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria that are [[antibiotic resistance|resistant]] to other antibiotics; it should not be used against bacteria that are sensitive to drugs with a narrower spectrum of activity, such as [[penicillin]]s and [[cephalosporin]]s. In both the popular press and the scientific literature, linezolid has been called a "reserve antibiotic"—one that should be used sparingly so that it will remain effective as a [[drug of last resort]] against potentially intractable infections.<ref>{{cite news |first=David |last=Wroe |title=An antibiotic to fight immune bugs |work=[[The Age]] |date=2002-02-28 |accessdate=2009-05-16 |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/02/27/1014704966995.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127140624/http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/02/27/1014704966995.html |archivedate=2010-01-27 |df= }}</ref><ref name=Wilson>{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilson AP, Cepeda JA, Hayman S, Whitehouse T, Singer M, Bellingan G |title=In vitro susceptibility of Gram-positive pathogens to linezolid and teicoplanin and effect on outcome in critically ill patients |journal=[[Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy]] |volume=58 |issue=2 |pages=470–3 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16735420 |doi=10.1093/jac/dkl233 |issn=0305-7453 |url=http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/58/2/470.full.pdf }}</ref>

In the United States, the indications for linezolid use approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) are the treatment of [[vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus|vancomycin-resistant ''Enterococcus'']] [[Enterococcus faecium|''faecium'']] [[infections]], with or without [[bacteremia|bacterial invasion of the bloodstream]]; [[nosocomial pneumonia]] (hospital-acquired) and [[community-acquired pneumonia]] caused by ''S. aureus'' or ''S. pneumoniae''; [[complicated skin and skin structure infection]]s (cSSSI) caused by susceptible bacteria, including [[diabetic foot]] infection, unless complicated by [[osteomyelitis]] (infection of the bone and bone marrow); and ''uncomplicated'' skin and soft tissue infections caused by ''S. pyogenes'' or ''S. aureus''.<ref name=PI2010/> The manufacturer advises against the use of linezolid for community-acquired pneumonia or ''uncomplicated'' skin and soft tissue infections caused by MRSA.<ref name=PI2010/> In the United Kingdom, pneumonia and cSSSIs are the only indications noted in the product labeling.<ref name=SPC>{{cite web |author=[No authors listed] |url=http://emc.medicines.org.uk/medicine/9857 |title=Zyvox 600 mg Film-Coated Tablets, 100 mg/5 ml Granules for Oral Suspension, 2 mg/ml Solution for Infusion&nbsp;– Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) |publisher=electronic Medicines Compendium |date=2009-06-24 |accessdate=2009-07-03}}</ref>

Some authors have recommended that combinations of cheaper or more cost-effective drugs (such as [[co-trimoxazole]] with [[rifampicin]] or [[clindamycin]]) be tried before linezolid in the treatment of SSTIs when susceptibility of the causative organism allows it.<ref name=Pigrau/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Grammatikos A, Falagas ME |title=Linezolid for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infection |journal=Expert Review of Dermatology |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=539–48 |year=2008 |doi=10.1586/17469872.3.5.539}}</ref>

Several issues in study design have been raised, however, calling into question results that suggest the superiority of linezolid.<ref name=Pigrau/> Regardless, linezolid's advantages include its high [[bioavailability]]  (because it allows easy switching to oral therapy), and the fact that poor kidney function is not an obstacle to use (whereas achieving the correct dosage of vancomycin in patients with [[renal failure|renal insufficiency]] is very difficult).<ref name=USHAPGuideline/>

It is traditionally believed that so-called "deep" infections—such as osteomyelitis or [[infective endocarditis]]—should be treated with bactericidal antibiotics, not bacteriostatic ones. Nevertheless, preclinical studies were conducted to assess the efficacy of linezolid for these infections,<ref name=Barbachyn/> and the drug has been used successfully to treat them in clinical practice.

====Catheter-related infections====
In March 2007, the FDA reported the results of a [[randomized controlled trial|randomized]], [[open-label trial|open-label]], phase III clinical trial comparing linezolid to vancomycin in the treatment of [[central venous catheter#Infection|catheter-related bloodstream infections]]. Patients treated with vancomycin could be switched to [[oxacillin]] or [[dicloxacillin]] if the bacteria that caused their infection was found to be susceptible, and patients in both groups (linezolid and vancomycin) could receive specific treatment against Gram-negative bacteria if necessary.<ref name=CRBSI>{{cite web |author=[No authors listed] |url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/DrugSafetyInformationforHeathcareProfessionals/ucm085249.htm |title=Information for Healthcare Professionals: Linezolid (marketed as Zyvox) |date=March 16, 2007 |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) |accessdate=2010-09-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019044734/http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/DrugSafetyInformationforHeathcareProfessionals/ucm085249.htm |archivedate=October 19, 2010 |df= }}</ref> The study itself was published in January 2009.<ref name=Wilcox>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Wilcox MH, Tack KJ, Bouza E, etal |title=Complicated skin and skin-structure infections and catheter-related bloodstream infections: noninferiority of linezolid in a phase 3 study |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=203–12 |date=January 2009 |pmid=19072714 |doi=10.1086/595686 |issn=1058-4838}}</ref>

Linezolid was associated with [[statistical significance|significant]]ly greater mortality than the comparator antibiotics. When data from all participants were pooled, the study found that 21.5% of those given linezolid died, compared to 16% of those not receiving it. The difference was found to be due to the inferiority of linezolid in the treatment of Gram-negative infections alone or mixed Gram-negative/Gram-positive infections. In participants whose infection was due to Gram-positive bacteria alone, linezolid was as safe and effective as vancomycin.<ref name=CRBSI/><ref name=Wilcox/> In light of these results, the FDA issued an alert reminding healthcare professionals that linezolid is not approved for the treatment of catheter-related infections or infections caused by Gram-negative organisms, and that more appropriate therapy should be instituted whenever a Gram-negative infection is confirmed or suspected.<ref name=CRBSI/>

===Specific populations===
In adults and children over the age of 12, linezolid is usually given every 12 hours, whether orally or intravenously.<ref name=Moellering/><ref name="American Family Physician"/> In younger children and infants, it is given every eight hours.<ref name=Buck>{{cite journal |author=Buck ML |title=Linezolid use for resistant Gram-positive infections in children |journal=Pediatric Pharmacotherapy |volume=9 |issue=6 |date=June 2003 |url=http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/alive/pediatrics/PharmNews/200306.pdf |accessdate=2009-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605115607/http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/alive/pediatrics/PharmNews/200306.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-05 |df= }}</ref> No dosage adjustments are required in the elderly, in people with mild-to-moderate liver failure, or in those with impaired kidney function.<ref name=Lexi-Comp/> In people requiring [[hemodialysis]], care should be taken to give linezolid after a session, because dialysis removes 30–40% of a dose from the body; no dosage adjustments are needed in people undergoing [[hemofiltration|continuous hemofiltration]],<ref name=Lexi-Comp/> although more frequent administration may be warranted in some cases.<ref name=Herrmann/> According to one study, linezolid may need to be given more frequently than normal in people with [[burn]]s affecting more than 20% of [[total body surface area|body area]], due to increased nonrenal clearance of the drug.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Lovering AM, Le Floch R, Hovsepian L, etal |title=Pharmacokinetic evaluation of linezolid in patients with major thermal injuries |journal=Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy |volume=63 |issue=3 |pages=553–9 |date=March 2009 |pmid=19153078 |doi=10.1093/jac/dkn541 |issn=0305-7453}}</ref>

Linezolid is in U.S. [[pregnancy category]] C, meaning there have been no adequate studies of its safety when used by pregnant women, and although animal studies have shown mild toxicity to the fetus, the benefits of using the drug may outweigh its risks.<ref name=PI2010/> It also passes into [[breast milk]], although the clinical significance of this (if any) is unknown.<ref name=InfectiousDiseases/>

Linezolid is effective against all clinically important Gram-positive [[bacteria]]—those whose [[cell wall]] contains a thick layer of [[peptidoglycan]] and no [[bacterial outer membrane|outer membrane]]—notably ''[[Enterococcus faecium]]'' and ''[[Enterococcus faecalis]]'' (including [[vancomycin-resistant enterococcus|vancomycin-resistant enterococci]]), ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (including methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'', MRSA), ''[[Streptococcus agalactiae]]'', ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'', the [[Streptococcus#Viridans and others|''viridans'' group streptococci]], ''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]'', and ''[[Corynebacterium]]'' species (the latter being among the most susceptible to linezolid, with [[minimum inhibitory concentration]]s routinely below 0.5&nbsp;mg/L).<ref name=PI2010/><ref name=Moellering/><ref name=Jones>{{cite journal |vauthors=Jones RN, Stilwell MG, Hogan PA, Sheehan DJ |title=Activity of Linezolid against 3,251 Strains of Uncommonly Isolated Gram-Positive Organisms: Report from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program |journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=1491–3 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17210770 |pmc=1855453 |doi=10.1128/AAC.01496-06}}</ref> Linezolid is also highly active ''[[in vitro]]'' against several [[Mycobacterium|mycobacteria]].<ref name=Moellering/> It appears to be very effective against ''[[Nocardia]]'', but because of high cost and potentially serious adverse effects, authors have recommended that it be combined with other antibiotics or reserved for cases that have failed traditional treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Jodlowski TZ, Melnychuk I, Conry J |title=Linezolid for the treatment of ''Nocardia'' spp. infections |journal=[[Annals of Pharmacotherapy]] |volume=41 |issue=10 |pages=1694–9 |date=October 2007 |pmid=17785610 |doi=10.1345/aph.1K196 |issn=1060-0280}}</ref>

====Comparable antibiotics====
Linezolid's spectrum of activity against Gram-positive bacteria is similar to that of the [[glycopeptide antibiotic]] [[vancomycin]], which has long been the standard for treatment of MRSA infections, and the two drugs are often compared.<ref name=Marino2007/><ref name=Herrmann/> Other comparable antibiotics include [[teicoplanin]] (trade name Targocid, a glycopeptide like vancomycin), [[quinupristin/dalfopristin]] (Synercid, a combination of two [[streptogramin]]s, not active against ''E. faecalis''),<ref name=Livermore/> and [[daptomycin]] (Cubicin, a [[lipopeptide]]), and some agents still being developed, such as [[ceftobiprole]], [[dalbavancin]], and [[telavancin]]. Linezolid is the only one that can be taken by mouth.<ref name=Herrmann/> In the future, [[oritavancin]] and [[iclaprim]] may be useful oral alternatives to linezolid—both are in the early stages of clinical development.<ref name=Herrmann/>

==Adverse effects==
When used for short periods, linezolid is a relatively safe drug.<ref name=Marino2007/> Common [[Adverse drug reaction|side effects]] of linezolid use (those occurring in more than 1% of people taking linezolid) include diarrhea (reported by 3–11% of clinical trial participants), headache (1–11%), nausea (3–10%), vomiting (1–4%), rash (2%), constipation (2%), altered taste perception (1–2%), and discoloration of the tongue (0.2–1%).<ref name=Lexi-Comp/> Fungal infections such as [[Oral candidiasis|thrush]] and [[candidal vulvovaginitis|vaginal candidiasis]] may also occur as linezolid suppresses normal bacterial flora and opens a niche for fungi (so-called [[antibiotic candidiasis]]).<ref name=Lexi-Comp/> Less common (and potentially more serious) adverse effects include allergic reactions, [[pancreatitis]], and [[elevated transaminases]], which may be a sign of liver damage.<ref name=Lexi-Comp/><ref name=French>{{cite journal |author=French G |title=Safety and tolerability of linezolid |journal=Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy |volume=51 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=ii45–53 |date=May 2003 |pmid=12730142 |doi=10.1093/jac/dkg253 |issn=0305-7453 |url=http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/51/suppl_2/ii45.full.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213090539/http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/51/suppl_2/ii45.full.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-13 |df= }} Review.

The adverse effects of long-term linezolid therapy were first identified during postmarketing surveillance. Bone marrow suppression was not identified during Phase III trials, in which treatment did not exceed 21 days. Although some participants of early trials did experience thrombocytopenia, it was found to be reversible and did not occur significantly more frequently than in controls (participants not taking linezolid).<ref name=Moellering/> There have also been postmarketing reports of [[seizure]]s, and, {{as of|2009|lc=on}}, a single case each of [[Bell's palsy]] (paralysis of the [[facial nerve]]) and [[nephrotoxicity|kidney toxicity]].<ref name=Metaxas/>

==Interactions==
Linezolid is a weak [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]] (MAOI), and should not be used concomitantly with other MAOIs, large amounts of [[tyramine]]-rich foods (such as pork, aged cheeses, alcoholic beverages, or smoked and pickled foods), or [[serotonergic]] drugs. There have been [[postmarketing surveillance|postmarketing reports]] of [[serotonin syndrome]] when linezolid was given with or soon after the discontinuation of serotonergic drugs, particularly [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s such as [[paroxetine]] and [[sertraline]].<ref name=French/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lawrence KR, Adra M, Gillman PK |title=Serotonin toxicity associated with the use of linezolid: a review of postmarketing data |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=1578–83 |date=June 2006 |pmid=16652315 |doi=10.1086/503839 |issn=1058-4838}}</ref><ref name=Huang>{{cite journal |vauthors=Huang V, Gortney JS |title=Risk of serotonin syndrome with concomitant administration of linezolid and serotonin agonists |journal=Pharmacotherapy |volume=26 |issue=12 |pages=1784–93 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17125439 |doi=10.1592/phco.26.12.1784 |issn=0277-0008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/580101 |title=FDA Safety Changes: Mirena, Zyvox, Orencia |author=Waknine, Yael |date=September 5, 2008 |publisher=[[Medscape]] |accessdate=2008-09-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202190427/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/580101 |archivedate=December 2, 2008 |df= }} Freely available with registration.</ref> It may also enhance the blood pressure-increasing effects of [[sympathomimetic drug]]s such as [[pseudoephedrine]] or [[phenylpropanolamine]].<ref name=Moellering/><ref name=Stalker>{{cite journal |vauthors=Stalker DJ, Jungbluth GL |title=Clinical pharmacokinetics of linezolid, a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial |journal=Clinical Pharmacokinetics |volume=42 |issue=13 |pages=1129–40 |year=2003 |pmid=14531724 |doi=10.2165/00003088-200342130-00004 |issn=0312-5963}}</ref> It should also not be given in combination with [[pethidine]] ([[meperidine]]) under any circumstance due to the risk of [[serotonin syndrome]].

Linezolid does not [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibit]] or [[regulation of gene expression|induce]] the [[cytochrome P450]] (CYP) system, which is responsible for the metabolism of many commonly used drugs, and therefore does not have any CYP-related interactions.<ref name=PI2010/>

One of the advantages of linezolid is its high [[bioavailability]] (close to 100%) when given by mouth: the entire dose reaches the bloodstream, as if it had been given [[intravenous therapy|intravenously]]. This means that people receiving intravenous linezolid may be switched to oral linezolid as soon as their condition allows it, whereas comparable antibiotics (such as vancomycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin) can only be given intravenously.<ref name="American Family Physician">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ament PW, Jamshed N, Horne JP |title=Linezolid: its role in the treatment of gram-positive, drug-resistant bacterial infections |journal=[[American Family Physician]] |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=663–70 |date=February 2002 |pmid=11871684 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20020215/663.html |issn=0002-838X |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724045942/http://www.aafp.org/afp/20020215/663.html |archivedate=2008-07-24 |df= }}</ref>

Linezolid is [[drug metabolism|metabolized]] in the [[liver]], by [[redox|oxidation]] of the [[morpholine]] ring, without involvement of the [[cytochrome P450]] system. This metabolic pathway leads to two major inactive [[metabolite]]s (which each account for around 45% and 10% of an excreted dose at steady state), one minor metabolite, and several trace metabolites, none of which accounts for more than 1% of an excreted dose.<ref name=Slatter>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Slatter JG, Stalker DJ, Feenstra KL, etal |title=Pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and excretion of linezolid following an oral dose of [(14)C]linezolid to healthy human subjects |journal=Drug Metabolism and Disposition |volume=29 |issue=8 |pages=1136–45 |date=August 1, 2001 |pmid=11454733 |url=http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/content/29/8/1136.full.pdf |issn=0090-9556}}</ref> [[Clearance (medicine)|Clearance]] of linezolid varies with age and gender; it is fastest in children (which accounts for the shorter half-life), and appears to be 20% lower in women than in men.<ref name=PI2010/><ref name=Slatter/><ref name=Sisson>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sisson TL, Jungbluth GL, Hopkins NK |title=Age and sex effects on the pharmacokinetics of linezolid |journal=European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume=57 |issue=11 |pages=793–7 |date=January 2002 |pmid=11868801 |doi=10.1007/s00228-001-0380-y |issn=0031-6970}}</ref> There is a strong correlation between linezolid clearance and creatinine clearance (CLCR).<ref name=Bialvaei>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bialvaei AZ, Rahbar M, Yousefi M, etal |title=Linezolid: a promising option in the treatment of Gram-positives |journal=Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy|volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=354-364 |date=February 2017 |pmid=27999068 |url=https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/72/2/354/2629138/Linezolid-a-promising-option-in-the-treatment-of |doi=10.1093/jac/dkw450}}</ref>

It does so by preventing the formation of the initiation complex, composed of the [[30S]] and [[50S]] subunits of the ribosome, [[transfer RNA|tRNA]], and mRNA.

==Chemistry==
At [[pH#Living systems|physiological pH]], linezolid exists in an uncharged state. It is moderately water-soluble (approximately 3&nbsp;mg/mL), with a [[partition coefficient|log''P'']] of 0.55.<ref name=Herrmann/>

[[File:Linezolid showing oxazolidinone pharmacophore.svg|thumb|left|Numbered structure of linezolid, showing the [[pharmacophore]] required for good activity (in blue) and desirable structural features (in orange).|alt=Skeletal formula of N-<nowiki/>{[(5S)-3-[3-fluoro-4-(morpholin-4-yl)phenyl]-2-oxo-1,3-oxazolidin-5-yl]methyl}acetamide, highlighting the morpholino and fluoro groups in orange, with the rest in blue. The carbon atoms of the parent chain are numbered.]]
The oxazolidinone [[pharmacophore]]—the chemical "template" essential for antimicrobial [[biological activity|activity]]—consists of a [[2-Oxazolidone|1,3-oxazolidin-2-one]] [[functional group|moiety]] with an [[aryl]] group at position 3 and an ''S''-[[methyl group]], with another [[substituent]] attached to it, at position 5 (the ''R''-[[enantiomer]]s of all oxazolidinones are devoid of antibiotic properties).<ref name=Brickner/> In addition to this essential core, linezolid also contains several structural characteristics that improve its effectiveness and safety. An [[acetamide]] substituent on the 5-methyl group is the best choice in terms of antibacterial efficacy, and is used in all of the more active oxazolidinones developed thus far; in fact, straying too far from an acetamide group at this position makes the drug lose its antimicrobial power, although weak to moderate activity is maintained when some [[bioisostere|isosteric]] groups are used. A [[fluorine]] atom at the 3′ position practically doubles ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo'' activity, and the [[electron donor|electron-donating]] [[nitrogen]] atom in the [[morpholine]] ring helps maintain high antibiotic potency and an acceptable safety profile.<ref name=Barbachyn/><ref name=Brickner/>

The [[anticoagulant]] [[rivaroxaban]] (Xarelto) bears a striking structural similarity to linezolid; both drugs share the oxazolidinone pharmacophore, differing in only three areas (an extra [[ketone]] and chloro[[thiophene]], and missing the fluorine atom). However this similarity appears to carry no clinical significance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Assessment_Report_-_Variation/human/000944/WC500120736.pdf |title=CHP Assessment Report for Xarelto (EMA/CHMP/301607/2011) |author=European Medicines Agency |year=2011 |accessdate=2012-03-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130062132/http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Assessment_Report_-_Variation/human/000944/WC500120736.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-30 |df= }}</ref>

===Synthesis===
Linezolid is a completely [[organic synthesis|synthetic]] drug: it does not occur in nature (unlike erythromycin and many other antibiotics) and was not developed by building upon a naturally occurring skeleton (unlike most [[beta-lactam antibiotic|beta-lactam]]s, which are [[semisynthesis|semisynthetic]]). Many approaches are available for oxazolidinone synthesis, and several routes for the synthesis of linezolid have been reported in the chemistry literature.<ref name=Brickner/><ref name=Xu>{{cite journal|vauthors=Xu GY, Zhou Y, Xu MC |title=A convenient synthesis of antibacterial linezolid from (''S'')-glyceraldehyde acetonide |journal=Chinese Chemical Letters |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=302–4 |year=2006 |url=http://www.imm.ac.cn/journal/ccl/1703/170306-302-b050449-p3.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707013015/http://www.imm.ac.cn/journal/ccl/1703/170306-302-b050449-p3.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}</ref> Despite good [[yield (chemistry)|yields]], the original method (developed by Upjohn for [[pilot plant]]-scale production of linezolid and eperezolid) is lengthy, requires the use of expensive chemicals—such as [[palladium on carbon]] and the highly sensitive reagents [[methanesulfonyl chloride]] and [[n-Butyllithium|''n''-butyllithium]]—and needs low-temperature conditions.<ref name=Brickner/><ref name=Xu/><ref name=Kaiser>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaiser CR, Cunico W, Pinheiro AC, de Oliveira AG, Peralta MA, de Souza MV |title=Oxazolidinonas: uma nova classe de compostos no combate à tuberculose |trans_title=Oxazolidinones: a new class of compounds against tuberculosis |language=Portuguese |journal=Revista Brasileira de Farmácia |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=83–8 |year=2007 |url=http://www.rbfarma.org.br/images/edicoes-em-pdf/2007/RBF_V88_N2_2007/PAG83a88_OXAZOLIDINONAS.pdf |format=pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67ft9fcH1?url=http://www.rbfarma.org.br/images/edicoes-em-pdf/2007/RBF_V88_N2_2007/PAG83a88_OXAZOLIDINONAS.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-15 |df= }}</ref> Much of the high cost of linezolid has been attributed to the expense of its synthesis.<ref name=Kaiser/> A somewhat more concise and cost-effective route better suited to large-scale production was patented by Upjohn in 1998.<ref name=Barbachyn/><ref>{{US patent reference | number = 5837870 | y = 1997 | m = 03 | d = 28 | inventor = Pearlman BA, Perrault WR, Barbachyn MR, ''et al.'' | title = Process to prepare oxazolidinones}} Retrieved on 2009-06-13.</ref>

===Mechanism===
The ''intrinsic'' resistance of most Gram-negative bacteria to linezolid is due to the activity of [[efflux (microbiology)|efflux pumps]], which [[active transport|actively]] "pump" linezolid out of the cell faster than it can accumulate.<ref name=Barbachyn/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Schumacher A, Trittler R, Bohnert JA, Kümmerer K, Pagès JM, Kern WV |title=Intracellular accumulation of linezolid in ''Escherichia coli'', ''Citrobacter freundii'' and ''Enterobacter aerogenes'': role of enhanced efflux pump activity and inactivation |journal=Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy |volume=59 |issue=6 |pages=1261–4 |date=June 2007 |pmid=16971414 |doi=10.1093/jac/dkl380 |issn=0305-7453 |url=http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/59/6/1261.full.pdf }}</ref>

Gram-positive bacteria usually develop resistance to linezolid as the result of a [[point mutation]] known as ''G2576T'', in which a [[guanine]] base is replaced with [[thymine]] in [[base pair]] 2576 of the genes coding for 23S ribosomal RNA.<ref name=Saager>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Saager B, Rohde H, Timmerbeil BS, etal |title=Molecular characterisation of linezolid resistance in two vancomycin-resistant (VanB) ''Enterococcus faecium'' isolates using Pyrosequencing |journal=European Journal of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases |volume=27 |issue=9 |pages=873–8 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18421487 |doi=10.1007/s10096-008-0514-6 |issn=0934-9723}}</ref><ref name=Besier>{{cite journal |vauthors=Besier S, Ludwig A, Zander J, Brade V, Wichelhaus TA |title=Linezolid Resistance in Staphylococcus aureus: Gene Dosage Effect, Stability, Fitness Costs, and Cross-Resistances |journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=1570–2 |date=April 2008 |pmid=18212098 |pmc=2292563 |doi=10.1128/AAC.01098-07 |issn=0066-4804 |url=http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/52/4/1570.pdf }}</ref> This is the most common mechanism of resistance in staphylococci, and the only one known to date in isolates of ''E. faecium''.<ref name=Scheetz>{{cite journal |vauthors=Scheetz MH, Knechtel SA, Malczynski M, Postelnick MJ, Qi C |title=Increasing Incidence of Linezolid-Intermediate or -Resistant, Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus faecium Strains Parallels Increasing Linezolid Consumption |journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy |volume=52 |issue=6 |pages=2256–9 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18391028 |pmc=2415807 |doi=10.1128/AAC.00070-08 |issn=0066-4804 |url=http://aac.asm.org/cgi/reprint/52/6/2256.pdf }}</ref> Other mechanisms have been identified in ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' (including mutations in an RNA [[methyltransferase]] that methylates G2445 of the 23S rRNA and mutations causing increased [[gene expression|expression]] of [[ATP-binding cassette transporter|ABC transporter]] genes)<ref name=Feng2009>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Feng J, Lupien A, Gingras H, etal |title=Genome sequencing of linezolid-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae mutants reveals novel mechanisms of resistance |journal=Genome Research |volume=19 |issue=7 |pages=1214–23 |date=May 2009 |pmid=19351617 |doi=10.1101/gr.089342.108 |issn=1088-9051 |pmc=2704432}}</ref> and in ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lincopan N, de Almeida LM, Elmor de Araújo MR, Mamizuka EM |title=Linezolid resistance in ''Staphylococcus epidermidis'' associated with a G2603T mutation in the 23S rRNA gene |journal=International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents |volume= 34|issue= 3|pages= 281–2|date=April 2009 |pmid=19376688 |doi=10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2009.02.023 |issn=0924-8579}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Liakopoulos A, Neocleous C, Klapsa D, etal |title=A T2504A mutation in the 23S rRNA gene responsible for high-level resistance to linezolid of ''Staphylococcus epidermidis'' |journal=Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy |volume= 64|issue=1 |pages= 206–7|date=July 2009 |pmid=19429927 |doi=10.1093/jac/dkp167 |issn=0305-7453}}</ref>

Linezolid was quite expensive in 2009; a course of treatment may cost one or two thousand U.S. dollars for the drug alone,<ref name=Lexi-Comp/> not to mention other costs (such as those associated with hospital stay). With the medication becoming generic the price has decreased such that in United States the wholesale cost of a course of treatment as of 2016 is about US$137.90.<ref name=Medi2016/> In India as of 2015 a month of linezolid, as would be used to treat tuberculosis cost about USS$60.<ref name=WHO2015Use/>

However, because intravenous linezolid may be switched to an oral formulation (tablets or oral solution) without jeopardizing efficacy, people may be discharged from hospital relatively early and continue treatment at home, whereas home treatment with injectable antibiotics may be impractical.<ref name=Grau2008/> Reducing the [[length of stay|length of hospital stay]] reduces the overall cost of treatment, even though linezolid may have a higher acquisition cost—that is, it may be more expensive—than comparable antibiotics.

Studies have been conducted in several countries with different [[health care system]] models to assess the [[cost-effectiveness analysis#CEA in pharmacoeconomics|cost-effectiveness]] of linezolid compared to glycopeptides such as vancomycin or teicoplanin. In most countries, linezolid was more cost-effective than comparable antibiotics for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia and complicated skin and skin structure infections, either due to higher cure and survival rates or lower overall treatment costs.<ref name=Grau2008/>
