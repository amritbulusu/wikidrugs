'''''Tao''''' or '''''Dao''''' ({{IPA-en|daʊ}}, {{respell|DOW}}; <small>from </small>{{zh|c=[[wikt:道|道]]|p={{audio|zh-dào.ogg|Dào}}}}) is a [[Chinese culture|Chinese]] word signifying 'way', 'path', 'route', 'road', 'choose', 'key' or sometimes more loosely 'doctrine',  'principle' or 'holistic [[science]]' <ref name="Zai 2015">Dr Zai, J. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-WzMCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover1 ''Taoism and Science: Cosmology, Evolution, Morality, Health and more'']. Ultravisum, 2015.</ref> . Within the context of traditional Chinese philosophy and religion, the Tao is the intuitive knowing of "life" that cannot be grasped full-heartedly as just a concept but is known nonetheless through actual living experience of one's everyday being. The Tao reverses the typical [cultural] order of values: it emphasizes the weak over the strong, the feminine over the masculine, the water that wears down the rock, the space between things rather than the things themselves.<ref name="Lobel2011">{{cite book|author=Diana Lobel|title=The Quest for God and the Good: World Philosophy as a Living Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bngSKEejW3wC&pg=PA64|date=16 August 2011|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-52701-9|page=64}}</ref>

[[Laozi]] in the [[Tao Te Ching]] explains that the Tao is not a 'name' for a 'thing' but the underlying natural order of the Universe whose ultimate essence is difficult to circumscribe due to it being non conceptual yet evident' in one's being of aliveness.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The Tao is "eternally nameless" (Tao Te Ching-32. [[Laozi]]) and to be distinguished from the countless 'named' things which are considered to be its manifestations, the reality of life before its descriptions of it.

The Tao lends its name to the religious tradition ([[Wade–Giles]], ''Tao Chiao''; [[Pinyin]], ''Daojiao'') and philosophical tradition (Wade–Giles, ''Tao chia''; Pinyin, ''Daojia'') that are both referred to in English with the single term [[Taoism]].

== Description and uses of the concept ==
[[File:Pakua with frame.svg|250px|thumb|right|The [[ba gua]], a symbol commonly used to represent the Tao and its pursuit.]]The word "Tao" (道) has a variety of meanings in both ancient and modern Chinese language. Aside from its purely prosaic use to mean road, channel, path, principle, or similar,<ref>DeFrancis (1996) p. 113</ref> the word has acquired a variety of differing and often confusing metaphorical, philosophical and religious uses. In most belief systems, the word is used symbolically in its sense of 'way' as the 'right' or 'proper' way of existence, or in the context of ongoing practices of attainment or of the full coming into being, or the state of [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] or spiritual perfection that is the outcome of such practices.<ref>LaFargue (1992), pp. 245–7.</ref>

Some scholars make sharp distinctions between moral or ethical usage of the word "Tao" that is prominent in [[Confucianism]] and religious Taoism and the more metaphysical usage of the term used in philosophical [[Taoism]] and most forms of [[Mahayana Buddhism]];<ref>Chan (1963) p. 136</ref> others maintain that these are not separate usages or meanings, seeing them as mutually inclusive and compatible approaches to defining the principle.<ref>Hansen (2000), p. 206.</ref> The original use of the term was as a form of [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] rather than theory – a term used as a convention to refer to something that otherwise cannot be discussed in words – and early writings such as the [[Tao Te Ching]] and the [[I Ching]] make pains to distinguish between ''conceptions of'' the Tao (sometimes referred to as "named Tao") and the Tao itself (the "unnamed Tao"), which cannot be expressed or understood in language.<ref group="notes">''Tao Te Ching'', Chapter 1. "It is from the unnamed Tao<br/>That Heaven and Earth sprang;<br/> The named is but<br/>The Mother of the ten thousand creatures."</ref><ref group="notes">''I Ching'', ''Ta Chuan'' (Great Treatise). "The kind man discovers it and calls it kind;<br/> the wise man discovers it and calls it wise;<br/> the common people use it every day<br/> and are not aware of it."</ref><ref>Liu (1981), pp. 1-3.</ref> Liu Da asserts that the Tao is properly understood as an experiential and evolving concept, and that there are not only cultural and religious differences in the interpretation of the Tao, but personal differences that reflect the character of individual practitioners.<ref>Liu (1981), pp. 2–3.</ref><!--Reference supports entire paragraph, including the references to primary sources.-->

The Tao can be roughly thought of as the ''flow of the Universe'', or as some essence or pattern behind the natural world that keeps the Universe balanced and ordered.<ref>Cane (2002), p. 13.</ref> It is related to the idea of [[qi]], the essential energy of action and existence. The Tao is a non-dualistic principle – it is the greater whole from which all the individual elements of the Universe derive.  Keller considers it similar to the [[negative theology]] of Western scholars,<ref>Keller (2003), p. 289.</ref> but the Tao is rarely an object of direct worship, being treated more like the [[Hindu]] concepts of [[karma]] or [[dharma]] than as a divine object.<ref>LaFargue (1994) p. 283.</ref>  The Tao is more commonly expressed in the relationship between ''[[Mu (negative)|wu]]'' (void or emptiness, in the sense of [[wuji (philosophy)|wuji]]) and [[yinyang]] (the natural dynamic balance between opposites), leading to its central principle of [[wu wei]] (non-action, or action without force).

The Tao is usually described in terms of elements of nature, and in particular as similar to water.  Like water it is undifferentiated, endlessly self-replenishing, soft and quiet but immensely powerful, and impassively generous.<ref>Water is soft and flexible, yet possesses an immense power to overcome obstacles and alter landscapes, even carving canyons with its slow and steady persistence. It is viewed as a reflection of, or close in action to, the Tao. The Tao is often expressed as a sea or flood that cannot be dammed or denied. It flows around and over obstacles like water, setting an example for those who wish to live in accord with it.Ch'eng and Cheng (1991), pp. 175–7.</ref> Much of Taoist philosophy centers on the cyclical continuity of the natural world, and its contrast to the linear, goal-oriented actions of human beings.

In all its uses, the Tao is considered to have [[ineffability|ineffable]] qualities that prevent it from being defined or expressed in words.  It can, however, be ''known'' or ''experienced'', and its principles (which can be discerned by observing Nature) can be followed or practiced.  Much of East Asian philosophical writing focuses on the value of adhering to the principles of the Tao and the various consequences of failing to do so.

The Tao was shared with [[Confucianism]], [[Chinese Chán|Chán]] and [[Zen|Zen Buddhism]] and more broadly throughout East Asian philosophy and religion in general.  In Taoism, Chinese Buddhism and Confucianism, the object of spiritual practice is to 'become one with the Tao' (Tao Te Ching) or to harmonise one's will with Nature (cf. [[Stoicism]]) in order to achieve 'effortless action' ([[Wu wei]]). This involves meditative and moral practices. Important in this respect is the Taoist concept of [[De (Chinese)|De]] (德; virtue).  In Confucianism and religious forms of Taoism, these are often explicitly moral/ethical arguments about proper behavior, while Buddhism and more philosophical forms of Taoism usually refer to the natural and mercurial outcomes of action (comparable to [[karma]]). The Tao is intrinsically related to the concepts [[yin and yang]] ([[pinyin]]: [[wikt:yīnyáng|yīnyáng]]), where every action creates counter-actions as unavoidable movements within manifestations of the Tao, and proper practice variously involves accepting, conforming to, or working with these natural developments.

===De===
{{Main article|De (Chinese)}}

'''De''' ([[wikt:德|德]] "power; virtue; integrity") is the term generally used to refer to proper adherence to the Tao;  De is the active living or cultivation of the way.<ref>Maspero (1981), p. 32.</ref> Particular things (things with names) that manifest from the Tao have their own inner nature that they follow, in accordance with the Tao, and the following of this inner nature is De.  [[Wu wei|Wuwei]] ([[Pinyin]]: [[wikt:wúwéi|wúwéi]]) or ''''naturalness'''' are contingent on understanding and conforming to this inner nature, which is interpreted variously from a personal, individual nature to a more generalized notion of human nature within the greater Universe.<ref>Bodde & Fung (1997), pp. 99–101.</ref>

Historically, the concept of De differed significantly between Taoists and Confucianists.  Confucianism was largely a moral system emphasizing the values of humaneness, righteousness, and filial duty, and so conceived De in terms of obedience to rigorously defined and codified social rules.  Taoists took a broader, more naturalistic/metaphysical view on the relationship between humankind and the Universe, and considered social rules to be at best a derivative reflection of the natural and spontaneous interactions between people, and at worst  calcified structure that inhibited naturalness and created conflict. This led to some philosophical and political conflicts between Taoists and Confucianisms. Several sections of the works attributed to [[Zhuang Zhou|Chuang Tzu]] are dedicated to critiques of the failures of Confucianism.

==Religious, philosophical, and cultural interpretations==

===Taoist interpretations===
{{See also|Taoism}}
<blockquote>[Tao] means a road, path, way; and hence, the way in which one does something; method, doctrine, principle. The Way of Heaven, for example, is ruthless; when autumn comes 'no leaf is spared because of its beauty, no flower because of its fragrance'. The Way of Man means, among other things, procreation; and eunuchs are said to be 'far from the Way of Man'. ''Chu Tao'' is 'the way to be a monarch', i.e. the art of ruling. Each school of philosophy has its ''tao'', its doctrine of the way in which life should be ordered. Finally in a particular school of philosophy whose followers came to be called Taoists, ''tao'' meant 'the way the universe works'; and ultimately something very like God, in the more abstract and philosophical sense of that term.<ref>[[Arthur Waley]], ''The way and its power: a study of the Tao tê ching and its place in Chinese thought'' (Grove Press, 1958). {{ISBN|0-8021-5085-3}}</ref></blockquote>

The Tao is what gives Taoism its English name, in both its philosophical and religious forms. The Tao is the fundamental and central concept of these schools of thought. Taoism perceives the Tao as a natural order underlying the substance and activity of the Universe. Language and the "naming" of the Tao is regarded negatively within Taoism; the Tao fundamentally exists and operates outside the realm of differentiation and linguistic constraints.<ref>Kohn (1993), p. 11.</ref>

====Diversity of views====
{{Quotation|The Tao causes the people to be fully in accord with the ruler.|[[Sun Tzu]], ''Art of War''}}

There is no single orthodox Taoist view of the Tao. All forms of Taoism center around Tao and De, but there is a broad variety of distinct interpretations among sects and even individuals within the same sect. Despite this diversity, there are some clear, common patterns and trends within Taoism and its branches.<ref name="Kohnp11-12">Kohn (1993), pp. 11–12.</ref>

The diversity of Taoist interpretations of the Tao can be seen across four texts representative of major streams of thought within Taoism. All four texts are used in modern Taoism with varying acceptance and emphasis among sects. The ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' is the oldest text and representative of a speculative and philosophical approach to the Tao. The ''[[Daotilun|Tao T'i Lun]]'' is an eighth century [[exegesis]] of the ''Tao Te Ching'', written from a well-educated and religious viewpoint, that represents the traditional scholarly perspective. The devotional perspective of the Tao is expressed in the ''[[Qingjing Jing|Ch'ing Ching Ching]]'', a [[liturgical text]] that was originally composed during the [[Han dynasty]] and is used as a [[hymnal]] in religious Taoism, especially among [[eremite]]s.  The ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' (also spelled Chuang Tzu) uses literary devices such as tales, allegories, and narratives to relate the Tao to the reader, illustrating a metaphorical method of viewing and expressing the Tao.<ref>Kohn (1993), p. 12.</ref>

[[File:Taoist monk.jpg|thumbnail|right|A Taoist [[monk]] practicing [[Chinese calligraphy]] with water on stone. Water calligraphy, like [[sand mandala]]s, evokes the ephemeral nature of physical reality.]]
The forms and variations of religious Taoism are incredibly diverse. They integrate a broad spectrum of academic, ritualistic, supernatural, devotional, literary, and folk practices with a multitude of results. Buddhism and [[Confucianism]] particularly affected the way many sects of Taoism framed, approached, and perceived the Tao. The multitudinous branches of religious Taoism accordingly regard the Tao, and interpret writings about it, in innumerable ways. Thus, outside of a few broad similarities, it is difficult to provide an accurate yet clear summary of their interpretation of the Tao.<ref>Fowler (2005), pp. 5–7.</ref>

A central tenet within most varieties of religious Taoism is that the Tao is ever-present, but must be manifested, cultivated, and/or perfected in order to be realized. It is the source of the Universe and the seed of its primordial purity resides in all things. The manifestation of the Tao is De, which rectifies and invigorates the world with the Tao's radiance.<ref name="Kohnp11-12"/>

Alternatively, philosophical Taoism regards the Tao as a non-religious concept; it is not a deity to be worshiped, nor is it a mystical Absolute in the religious sense of the Hindu [[Brahman]]. Joseph Wu remarked of this conception of the Tao, "Dao is not religiously available; nor is it even religiously relevant." The writings of Lao Tzu and Chang Tzu are tinged with [[esotericism|esoteric]] tones and approach [[humanism]] and [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] as paradoxes.<ref>Moeller (2006) pp. 133–145.</ref> In contrast to the esotericism typically found in religious systems, the Tao is not transcendent to the self nor is mystical attainment an escape from the world in philosophical Taoism. The self steeped in the Tao is the self grounded in its place within the natural Universe. A person dwelling within the Tao excels in themselves and their activities.<ref>Fowler (2005), pp. 5–6.</ref>
<!--Historical, "elite"/"professional"/"scholarly" perspectives needed-->

However, this distinction is complicated by [[hermeneutic]] (interpretive) difficulties in the categorization of Taoist schools, sects and movements.<ref>Mair (2001) p. 174</ref> Some scholars believe that there is no distinction between ''Daojia'' and ''Daojiao''.<ref>Robinet (1997), p. 3.</ref> According to Kirkland, "most scholars who have seriously studied Daoism, both in Asia and the West, have finally abandoned the simplistic dichotomy of ''[[wikt:Dàojiā|Dàojiā]]'' and ''[[wikt:Dàojiào|Dàojiào]]'', 'philosophical Daoism' and 'religious Daoism.'"<ref>Kirkland (2004) p. 2.</ref>

===Confucian interpretations===
{{See also|Confucianism}}
The ''Dao'', or Way, of [[Confucius]] can be said to be 'Truth'. Confucianism regards the Way, or Truth, as concordant with a particular approach to life, politics, and tradition. It is held as equally necessary and well regarded as ''De'' ([[morality|virtue]]) and ''[[ren (Confucianism)|ren]]'' ([[compassion|humanity]]). Confucius presents a [[humanism|humanist]]ic 'Dao'. He only rarely speaks of the t'ien Dao (Way of Heaven). An influential early Confucian, Hsiin Tzu, explicitly noted this contrast. Though he acknowledged the existence and celestial importance of the Way of Heaven, he insisted that the Dao principally concerns human affairs.<ref name="Taylor & Choy 2005, p. 589">Taylor & Choy (2005), p. 589.</ref>

As a formal religious concept in Confucianism, Dao is the Absolute towards which the faithful move. In ''[[Doctrine of the Mean|Zhongyong]]'' (The Doctrine of the Mean), harmony with the Absolute is equivalent to integrity and sincerity. The ''[[Great Learning]]'' expands on this concept explaining that the Way illuminates virtue, improves the people, and resides within the purest morality. During the [[Tang dynasty]], [[Han Yu]] further formalized and defined Confucian beliefs as an [[apologetics|apologetic]] response to [[Buddhism]]. He emphasized the ethics of the Way. He explicitly paired 'Dao' and 'De', focusing on humane nature and righteousness. He also framed and elaborated on a "[[wikt:dàotǒng|dàotǒng]]" (tradition of the Way) in order to reject the traditions of Buddhism.<ref name="Taylor & Choy 2005, p. 589"/>

===Buddhist interpretations===
{{See also|Chinese Buddhism|Zen}}

Buddhism first started to spread in China during the first century AD and was experiencing a golden age of growth and maturation by the fourth century AD. Hundreds of collections of [[Pali]] and [[Sanskrit]] texts were translated into Chinese by Buddhist monks within a short period of time. [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|Dhyana]] was translated as [[ch'an]] (and later as zen), giving Zen Buddhism its name. The use of Chinese concepts, such as Dao, that were close to Buddhist ideas and terms helped spread the religion and make it more amenable to the Chinese people. However, the differences between the Sanskrit and Chinese terminology lead to some initial misunderstandings and the eventual development of [[East Asian Buddhism]] as a distinct entity. As part of this process, many Chinese words introduced their rich semantic and philosophical associations into Buddhism, including the use of 'Dao' for central concepts and tenets of Buddhism.<ref>Dumoulin (2005), pp. 63–65.</ref>

Pai-chang Huai-hai told a student who was grappling with difficult portions of [[suttas]], "Take up words in order to manifest meaning and you'll obtain 'meaning'. Cut off words and meaning is emptiness. Emptiness is the Dao. The Dao is cutting off words and speech." Ch'an (Zen) Buddhists regard the Dao as synonymous with both the Buddhist Path (''[[Noble Eightfold Path|marga]]'') and the results of it; the [[Eightfold Path]] and [[Buddhist enlightenment]] (''[[satori]]''). Pai-chang's statement plays upon this usage in the context of the fluid and varied Chinese usage of 'Dao'. Words and meaning are used to refer to rituals and practice. The 'emptiness' refers to the Buddhist concept of ''[[sunyata]]''. Finding the Dao and Buddha-nature is not simply a matter of formulations, but an active response to the [[Four Noble Truths]] that cannot be fully expressed or conveyed in words and concrete associations. The use of 'Dao' in this context refers to the literal 'way' of Buddhism, the return to the universal source, [[dharma]], proper meditation, and [[nirvana]], among other associations. 'Dao' is commonly used in this fashion by Chinese Buddhists, heavy with associations and nuanced meanings.<ref>Hershock (1996), pp. 67–70.</ref>

===Neo-Confucian interpretations===
{{See also|Neoconfucianism}}
During the [[Song dynasty]], Neo-Confucians regarded Dao as the purest [[thing-in-itself]]. [[Shao Yong]] regarded the Dao as the origin of heaven, earth, and everything within them. In contrast, [[Zhang Zai]] presented a vitalistic Dao that was the fundamental component or effect of [[ch'i]], the motive energy behind life and the world. A number of later scholars adopted this interpretation, such as [[Tai Chen]] during the [[Qing Dynasty]].<ref name="Taylor & Choy 2005, p. 589"/>

[[Zhu Xi]], [[Cheng Ho]], and [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] perceived the Dao in the context of [[li (Neo-Confucianism)|li]] (Principle) and t'ien li (the Principle of Heaven). [[Cheng Hao]] regarded the fundamental matter of li, and thus Dao, to be humaneness. Developing compassion, altruism, and other humane virtues is the following of the Way. [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] followed this interpretation, elaborating on this perspective of Dao through teachings about [[yin-yang theory|yin-yang interactions]], the cultivation and preservation of life; and the axiom of a morally just universe.<ref name="Taylor & Choy 2005, p. 589"/>

In total, the Dao is equated with the Absolute. [[Wang Fuzhi]] expressed the Dao as the [[taiji|tai chi]], The Great Ultimate, as well as the road leading to it. Nothing exists apart from the Principle of Heaven in Neo-Confucianism. The Way is contained within all things. Thus, the religious life is not an elite or special journey for Neo-Confucians. The normal, mundane life is the path that leads to the Absolute, because the Absolute is contained within the mundane objects and events of daily life.<ref name="Taylor & Choy 2005, p. 589"/>

===Christian Interpretations===
{{See also|Christianity}}
Noted Christian author [[C.S. Lewis]] used the word Tao to describe "the doctrine of objective value, the belief that certain attitudes are really true, and others really false, the kind of thing the Universe is and the kind of things we are."<ref>Lewis, C.S., [[The Abolition of Man]]; pg 18</ref> He asserted that every religion and philosophy contains foundations of universal ethics as an attempt to line up with the Tao—the way mankind was designed to be. In Lewis' thinking, [[God in Christianity|God]] created the Tao and fully displayed it through the person of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]].

Also the Greek word used in the [[New Testament]] for the Way is ὁδός (hodos). Here the Way refers to the path of righteousness and salvation as revealed through [[Jesus|Christ]].

In Chinese translations of the [[New Testament]], λόγος ([[logos]]) is translated with the Chinese word dao (道) (e.g. [[Gospel of John|John]] 1:1), indicating that the translators considered the concept of Tao to be somewhat equivalent to logos in [[Greek Philosophy|Greek philosophy]].

== Linguistic aspects==
The term ''dao'' 道 is analyzable in terms of Chinese characters, alternate ''dào'' "way" or ''dǎo'' "guide" pronunciations and meanings, a possible Proto-Indo-European [[etymology]], and [[loanword]]s such as English ''Dao'' or ''dao''.
[[File:道-bronze.svg|thumb|[[Bronze script]] for ''dao'' 道]]
[[File:道-bigseal.svg|thumb|[[Large seal script]] for ''dao'' 道]]
[[File:道-seal.svg|thumb|[[Small seal script]] for ''dao'' 道]]

===Characters===
''Dao'' is written with the Chinese character [[Wikt:道|道]] in both [[Traditional Chinese]] and [[Simplified Chinese]]. It typifies the most common [[Chinese character classification]] of "radical-phonetic" or "phono-semantic" graphs, which compound a "[[radical (Chinese character)|radical]]" or "signific" (roughly providing [[semantic]] information) with a "[[phonetic]]" (suggesting ancient pronunciation).

''Dao'' 道 graphically combines the ''chuo'' [[Wikt:辶|辶]] (or [[Wikt:辵|辵]]) "go" radical and ''shou'' [[Wikt:首|首]] "head" phonetic. Furthermore, ''dao'' 道 is the phonetic element in ''dao'' [[Wikt:導|導]] "guide; lead" (with the ''cun'' [[Wikt:寸|寸]] "thumb; hand" radical) and ''dao'' [[Wikt:檤|檤]] "a tree name" (with the ''mu'' [[Wikt:木|木]] "tree; wood" radical).

The traditional interpretation of the 道 character, dating back to the (121 CE) ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' dictionary, was a rare ''huiyi'' 會意 "compound ideogram" or "[[Chinese character classification#Ideogrammic compounds|ideogrammic compound]]". The combination of ''chuo'' 辶 "go" and ''shou'' 首 "head" (numbers 162 and 185 in the [[List of Kangxi radicals|Kangxi radicals]]) signified a "head going" or "to lead the way".

''Dao'' is graphically distinguished between its earliest nominal meaning of ''dao'' 道 "way; road; path;" and the later verbal sense of "say". It should also be contrasted with ''dao'' 導 "lead the way; guide; conduct; direct; ". The Simplified character [[Wikt:导|导]] for ''dao'' 導 has ''si'' [[Wikt:巳|巳]] "6th of the 12 [[Earthly Branches]]" in place of ''dao'' 道.

The earliest written forms of ''dao'' are [[bronzeware script]] and [[seal script]] characters from [[Zhou Dynasty]] (1045–256 BCE) bronzes and writings. These ancient ''dao'' characters more clearly depict the ''shou'' 首 "head" element as hair above a face. Some variants interchange the ''chuo'' 辵 "go; advance" radical with the ''xing'' 行 "go; road" radical, with the original bronze "crossroads" depiction written in the seal character with two 彳 and 亍 "footprints".

Bronze scripts for ''dao'' 道 occasionally include an element of ''shou'' 手 "hand" or ''cun'' 寸 "thumb; hand", which occurs in ''dao'' 導 "lead". The linguist [[Peter A. Boodberg]] explained,
<blockquote>This "''tao'' with the hand element" is usually identified with the modern character導 ''tao'' < ''d'ôg'', "to lead," "guide," "conduct," and considered to be a ''derivative'' or verbal cognate of the noun ''tao'', "way," "path." The evidence just summarized would indicate rather that "''tao'' with the hand" is but a ''variant'' of the basic ''tao'' and that the word itself combined both nominal and verbal aspects of the etymon. This is supported by textual examples of the use of the primary ''tao'' in the verbal sense "to lead" (e. g., ''Analects'' 1.5; 2.8) and seriously undermines the unspoken assumption implied in the common translation of ''Tao'' as "way" that the concept is essentially a nominal one. ''Tao'' would seem, then, to be etymologically a more dynamic concept than we have made it translation-wise. It would be more appropriately rendered by "lead way" and "lode" ("way," "course," "journey," "leading," "guidance"; cf. "lodestone" and "lodestar"), the somewhat obsolescent deverbal noun from "to lead."<ref>Boodberg (1957), p. 599</ref> </blockquote>
These Confucian ''[[Analects]]'' citations of ''dao'' verbally meaning "to guide; to lead" are: "The Master said, 'In guiding a state of a thousand chariots, approach your duties with reverence and be trustworthy in what you say" and "The Master said, 'Guide them by edicts, keep them in line with punishments, and the common people will stay out of trouble but will have no sense of shame." <ref>1.5 and 2.8, tr. Lau (1979), p. 59 and p. 63.</ref>

===Etymology===
In [[Modern Standard Chinese]], ''dao'' 道's pronunciations are [[Mandarin phonology#Tones|tonally]] differentiated between 4th falling tone ''dào'' "way; path" and 3rd dipping tone ''dǎo'' (usually written 導) "guide; lead".

Besides these common 4th and 3rd tonal specifications ''dào'' 道 "way" and ''dǎo'' 道 (or 導) "guide", 道 has a rare 1st level tone ''dāo'' pronunciation in the regional [[chengyu|idiomatic expression]] ''shénshendāodāo'' 神神道道 "odd; bizarre". This [[reduplication]] of ''[[Shen (Chinese religion)|shen]]'' [[Wikt:神|神]] "spirit; god" and ''dao'' occurs in [[Northeast China]] speech.

In [[Middle Chinese]] (ca. 6th–10th centuries CE) [[tone name]] categories, 道 and 道/導 were ''qusheng'' 去聲 "departing tone" and ''shangsheng'' 上聲 "rising tone". [[Historical linguistics|Historical linguists]] have reconstructed Middle 道 "way" and 導 "guide" as ''d'âu-'' and ''d'âu:'' ([[Bernhard Karlgren]]),<ref>Karlgren (1957).</ref> ''dau'' and ''dau'' (Zhou Fagao),<ref>Zhou (1972).</ref> ''daw<sup>'</sup>'' and ''daw<sup>h</sup>'' ([[Edwin G. Pulleyblank]], "Early Middle"),<ref>Pulleyblank (1991).</ref> ''dawX'' and ''daws'' (William H. Baxter),<ref>Baxter (1992).</ref> and ''dâu''<sup>B</sup> and ''dâu''<sup>C</sup> (Axel Schuessler).<ref>Schuessler (2007).</ref>

In [[Old Chinese]] (ca. 7th–3rd centuries BCE) pronunciations, reconstructions for 道 "way" and 道/導 "guide" are *''d'ôg'' (Karlgren), *''dəw'' (Zhou), *''dəgwx'' and *''dəgwh'' ([[Li Fanggui]]),<ref>Li (1971).</ref> *''luʔ'' (Baxter), and *''lûʔ'' and *''lûh'' (Schuessler).

===Meanings===
The word ''dao'' 道 has many meanings. For example, the Chinese ''[[Hanyu Da Zidian]]'' dictionary defines 39 meanings for ''dào'' 道 "way; path" and 6 for ''dǎo'' 道 (導) "guide; lead".<ref>''Hanyu Da Zidian'' 漢語大字典 (1989), pp. 3864–3866.</ref>

[[John DeFrancis]]'s exemplary Chinese-English dictionary gives twelve meanings for ''dào'' 道 "way; path; say", three for ''dǎo'' 道 (or 導) "guide; lead", and one for ''dāo'' 道 in an "odd, bizarre" [[chengyu|idiomatic expression]]. Note that brackets clarify abbreviations and ellipsis marks omitted usage examples.

===Etymologies===
The etymological linguistic origins of ''dao'' "way; path" depend upon its Old Chinese pronunciation, which scholars have tentatively reconstructed as *''d'ôg'', *''dəgwx'', *''dəw'', *''luʔ'', and *''lûʔ''.

Boodberg noted that the ''shou'' 首 "head" phonetic in the ''dao'' 道 character was not merely phonetic but "etymonic", analogous with English ''to head'' meaning "to lead" and "to tend in a certain direction," "ahead," "headway".
<blockquote>Paronomastically, ''tao'' is equated with its [[homonym]] [[Wikt:蹈|蹈]] ''tao'' < ''d'ôg'', "to trample," "tread," and from that point of view it is nothing more than a "treadway," "headtread," or "foretread "; it is also occasionally associated with a near synonym (and possible cognate) [[Wikt:迪|迪]] ''ti'' < ''d'iôk'', "follow a road," "go along," "lead," "direct"; "pursue the right path"; a term with definite ethical overtones and a graph with an exceedingly interesting phonetic, [[Wikt:由|由]] ''yu'' < ''djôg''," "to proceed from." The reappearance of C162 [辶] "walk" in ''ti'' with the support of C157 [⻊] "foot" in ''tao'', "to trample," "tread," should perhaps serve us as a warning not to overemphasize the headworking functions implied in ''tao'' in preference to those of the lower extremities.<ref>Boodberg (1957), p. 602.</ref></blockquote>

[[Victor H. Mair]] proposes a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] etymology for ''dao'' 道, supported by numerous [[cognates]] in [[Indo-European languages]], and semantically similar [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] words.
<blockquote>The archaic pronunciation of Tao sounded approximately like ''drog'' or ''dorg''. This links it to the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''drogh'' (to run along) and Indo-European ''dhorg'' (way, movement). Related words in a few modern [[Indo-European languages]] are [[Russian language|Russian]] ''doroga'' (way, road), [[Polish language|Polish]] ''droga'' (way, road), [[Czech language|Czech]] ''dráha'' (way, track), [[Serbo-Croatian]] ''draga'' (path through a valley), and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] dialect ''drog'' (trail of animals; valley). …. The nearest [[Sanskrit]] (Old Indian) cognates to Tao (''drog'') are ''dhrajas'' (course, motion) and ''dhraj'' (course). The most closely related [[English language|English]] words are "track" and "trek", while "trail" and "tract" are derived from other cognate [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] roots. Following the Way, then, is like going on a cosmic trek. Even more unexpected than the panoply of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] cognates for Tao (''drog'') is the Hebrew root ''d-r-g'' for the same word and Arabic ''t-r-q'', which yields words meaning "track, path, way, way of doing things" and is important in [[Islam]]ic [[Islamic philosophy|philosophical]] discourse.<ref>Mair (1990), p. 132.</ref></blockquote>

Axel Schuessler's etymological dictionary presents two possibilities for the tonal [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of ''dào'' 道 "road; way; method" < Middle Chinese ''dâu''<sup>B</sup> < Old Chinese *''lûʔ'' and ''dào'' 道 or 導 "to go along; bring along; conduct; explain; talk about" < Middle ''dâu''<sup>C</sup> < Old *''lûh''.<ref>Schuessler (2007), p. 207</ref> Either ''dào'' 道 "the thing which is doing the conducting" is a Tone B (''shangsheng'' 上聲 "rising tone") "endoactive noun" derivation from ''dào'' 導 "conduct", or ''dào'' 導 is a Later Old Chinese ([[Warring States period]]) "general tone C" (''qusheng'' 去聲 "departing tone") derivation from ''dào'' 道 "way".<ref>Schuessler (2007), p. 48 and 41.</ref> For a possible etymological connection, Schuessler notes the ancient ''[[Fangyan]]'' dictionary defines ''yu'' < *''lokh'' 裕 and ''lu'' < *''lu'' 猷 as Eastern [[Qi (Shandong)|Qi State]] dialectal words meaning ''dào'' < *''lûʔ'' 道 "road".

===Loanwords===
Many languages have borrowed and adapted Chinese ''dao'' 道 "the way" as a [[loanword]].

In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], this character 道 is pronounced as [[Cantonese]] ''dou6'' and [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]] ''to7''. In [[Sino-Xenic]] languages, 道 is pronounced as [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ''dō'', ''tō'', or ''michi''; [[Korean language|Korean]] ''do'' or ''to''; and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] ''đạo'', ''dạo'', or ''nhạo''.

Since 1982, when the [[International Organization for Standardization]] adopted [[Pinyin]] as the standard [[romanization of Chinese]], many Western languages have changed from spelling this [[loanword]] ''tao'' in national systems (e.g., French [[EFEO Chinese transcription]] and English [[Wade–Giles]]) to ''dao'' in Pinyin.

The ''tao''/''dao'' "the way" [[List of English words of Chinese origin|English word of Chinese origin]] has three meanings, according to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.
<blockquote>'''1. a.''' In Taoism, an absolute entity which is the source of the universe; the way in which this absolute entity functions.<br />
'''1. b.''' = ''Taoism'', ''taoist''<br />
'''2.''' In Confucianism and in extended uses, the way to be followed, the right conduct; doctrine or method.</blockquote>
The earliest recorded usages were ''Tao'' (1736), ''Tau'' (1747), ''Taou'' (1831), and ''Dao'' (1971).

A derivative, ''[[Daoshi]]'' ({{zh|道士}}, "Daoist priest"), was used already by the [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuits]] [[Matteo Ricci]] and [[Nicolas Trigault]] in their ''[[De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas]]'', rendered as ''Tausu'' in the original Latin edition (1615),<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=iLsWAAAAQAAJ De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas suscepta ab Societate Jesu]'', Book One, Chapter 10, p. 125. Quote: "sectarii quidam ''Tausu'' vocant". Chinese gloss in  [[Pasquale M. d' Elia]], Matteo Ricci. ''Fonti ricciane: documenti originali concernenti Matteo Ricci e la storia delle prime relazioni tra l'Europa e la Cina (1579-1615)'', Libreria dello Stato, 1942; can be found by searching for "tausu" at https://books.google.com/books?id=zRw8AAAAMAAJ. [[Louis J. Gallagher]] (''China in the Sixteenth Century: The Journals of Matteo Ricci''; 1953), apparently has a typo (''Taufu'' instead of ''Tausu'') in the ''text'' of his translation of this line (p. 102), and ''Tausi'' in the index (p. 615)</ref>  and  ''Tausa'' in an early English translation published by [[Samuel Purchas]] (1625).<ref>''A discourse of the Kingdome of China, taken out of Ricius  and Trigautius, containing the countrey, people, government, religion, rites, sects, characters, studies, arts, acts ; and a Map of China added, drawne out of one there made with Annotations for the understanding thereof'' (excerpts from ''[[De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas]]'', in English translation) in ''[[Samuel Purchas|Purchas his Pilgrimes]]'', Volume XII, p. 461 (1625).  Quote: "... Lauzu ... left no Bookes of his Opinion, nor seemes to have intended any new Sect, but certaine Sectaries, called Tausa, made him the head of their sect after his death..."
