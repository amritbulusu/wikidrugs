'''Lefetamine''' ('''Santenol''') is a [[drug]] which is a [[stimulant]] and also an [[analgesic]] with effects comparable to [[codeine]].

Lefetamine-related 1,2-diphenylethylamines were invented in the 1940s and showed weak analgesic activity.<ref>{{Cite journal

It was abused in Japan during the 1950s. In a small study in 1989 it showed some effect against opioid withdrawal symptoms without causing withdrawal symptoms itself. It was concluded that it may be an opioid partial agonist.<ref>{{Cite journal

Regulation may vary; it does not appear as either a Narcotic or Non-Narcotic under the US Controlled Substances Act 1970 <ref>http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/quotas/conv_factor/index.html</ref>

The Canadian [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act]] was amended in 2016 to include the substance as a Schedule III substance. Possession without legal authority can result in maximum 3 years imprisonment. Further, [[Health Canada]] amended the ''Food and Drug Regulations'' in May, 2016 to classify Lefetamine as a controlled drug.<ref>[http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2016/2016-06-01/html/sor-dors106-eng.php Regulations Amending the Food and Drug Regulations (Parts G and J — Lefetamine, AH-7921, MT-45 and W-18)]</ref>
