'''Tobramycin''' is an [[aminoglycoside]] [[antibiotic]] derived from ''[[Streptomyces tenebrarius]]'' and used to treat various types of [[bacteria]]l infections, particularly [[Gram-negative]] infections. It is especially effective against species of ''[[Pseudomonas]]''.<ref>{{ cite web | title = Tobramycin | url = http://www.toku-e.com/Upload/Products/PDS/20120515001224.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = Toku-E | date = 2010-01-12 | accessdate = 2012-06-11 }}</ref>

==Medical uses==
Like all aminoglycosides, tobramycin does not pass the [[gastro-intestinal tract]], so for [[Systemic administration|systemic]] use it can only be given [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]] or [[Intramuscular injection|intramuscularly]]. Ophthalmic (tobramycin only, Tobrex, or combined with [[dexamethasone]], sold as TobraDex) and [[nebuliser|nebulised]] formulations both have low [[Absorption (pharmacokinetics)|systemic absorption]]. The formulation for injection is branded Nebcin. The nebulised formulation (brand name Tobi) is indicated in the treatment of [[exacerbation]]s of chronic infection with ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' in patients diagnosed with [[cystic fibrosis]]. A proprietary formulation of micronized, nebulized tobramycin has been tested as a treatment for bacterial [[sinusitis]].<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.mmdnewswire.com/nebulized-tobramycin-in-treating-bacterial-sinusitis-3630.html |title=Nebulized Tobramycin in treating bacterial Sinusitis |date=July 22, 2008 |accessdate=2009-12-06}}</ref>  Tobrex is a 0.3% tobramycin sterile ophthalmic solution is produced by [[Bausch & Lomb|Bausch & Lomb Pharmaceuticals]]. [[Benzalkonium chloride]] 0.01% is added as a preservative. It is available by prescription only in the United States and Canada. In certain countries, such as Italy, it is available over the counter. Tobrex and TobraDex are indicated in the treatment of superficial infections of the eye, such as [[conjunctivitis|bacterial conjunctivitis]]. 
Tobramycin (injection) is also indicated for various severe or life-threatening gram-negative infections: [[meningitis]] in [[neonate]]s, [[brucellosis]], [[pelvic inflammatory disease]], ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' infection ([[Plague (disease)|plague]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Tobramycin is preferred over [[gentamicin]] for [[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]] pneumonia due to better lung penetration.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}.

===Spectrum of susceptibility===
Tobramycin has a narrow spectrum of activity and is active against Gram-negative bacteria. Clinically, tobramycin is frequently used to eliminate ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' in cystic fibrosis patients. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few strains of ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'':
* ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' -  <0.25 µg/mL - 92 µg/mL [ref?]
* ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' (non-mucoid) - 0.5 µg/mL - >512 µg/mL [ref?]
* ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' (ATCC 27853) - 0.5 µg/mL - 2 µg/mL<ref>http://www.toku-e.com/Assets/MIC/Tobramycin.pdf</ref>
The MIC for ''Klebsiella pneumoniae, KP-1'', is 2.3±0.2 µg/mL at 25 °C [unpublished].

It's not active against gram positive Bacteria except for Staphylococcus aureus.

==Side effects==
Like other aminoglycosides, tobramycin is [[ototoxicity|ototoxic]]: it can cause [[Hearing impairment|hearing loss]], or a loss of [[equilibrioception]], or both in genetically susceptible individuals. These individuals carry a normally harmless genetic mutation that allows aminoglycosides such as tobramycin to affect [[cochlea|cochlear cells]]. Aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity is generally irreversible.

As with all amino glycosides, tobramycin is also nephrotoxic, it can damage or destroy the tissue of the kidneys [3]. This effect can be particularly worrisome when multiple doses accumulate over the course of a treatment or when the kidney concentrates urine by increasing [[Renal physiology|tubular reabsorption]] during sleep. Adequate hydration may help prevent excess nephrotoxicity and subsequent loss of renal function. For these reasons [[wikt:parenteral|parenteral]] tobramycin needs to be carefully dosed by [[body weight]], and its serum concentration monitored. Tobramycin is thus said to be a drug with a narrow [[therapeutic index]].

==Mechanism of action==
Tobramycin works by binding to a site on the bacterial [[30S]] and [[50S]] [[ribosome]], preventing formation of the 70S complex.  As a result, [[mRNA]] cannot be [[Translation (biology)|translated]] into protein, and cell death ensues. According to Kotra, Haddad and collaborators "aminoglycosides, including Tobramycin, are multifunctional hydrophilic sugars that possess several amino and hydroxy functionalities. The amine moieties are mostly [[Protonation|protonated]] in biological media; hence, these antibiotics can be considered polycationic species for the purpose of understanding their biological interactions. Since they are polycationic, they show a binding affinity for nucleic acids. Specifically, aminoglycosides possess high affinities for certain portions of RNAs, especially the prokaryotic rRNA. In addition, aminoglycosides bind to the hammerhead ribozyme, tRNA(Phe), the Rev response element (RRE) transcriptional activation region in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the ribozyme from hepatitis delta virus, and group I self-splicing introns.[4]"
