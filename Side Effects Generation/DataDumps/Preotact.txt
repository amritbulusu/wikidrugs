'''Preotact''' is a pharmaceutical form of [[parathyroid hormone]] ([[ATC code H05|H05AA03]]) manufactured using a strain of [[Escherichia coli]] modified by [[recombinant DNA]] technology. Preotact is used in the treatment of [[osteoporosis]] in [[menopause|postmenopausal]] women at high risk of osteoporotic [[bone fracture|fractures]]. A significant reduction in the [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of [[vertebrae|vertebral]] fractures has been demonstrated.
Preotact is marketed in Europe by [[Nycomed]]. '''Preos<sup>TM</sup>''' is a registered trade mark owned by NPS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The name Preos<sup>TM</sup> and the [[New Drug Application]] is pending approval by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).

== Clinical indication/use ==
Preotact is approved by the [[European Medicines Agency]] for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of fractures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emea.europa.eu/humandocs/Humans/EPAR/preotact/preotact.htm|title=Preotact: European Public Assessment Report|date=2006-04-24|work=EPARs for authorised medicinal products for human use|publisher=European Medicines Agency|accessdate=2009-07-12}}</ref> US approval is pending with the FDA.

== Administration ==
The recommended dose is 100 micrograms of Preotact administered once-daily as a [[subcutaneous injection]] into the abdomen, during 18 months (data support treatment up to 24 months).  The injections are given using a specially designed injection device (Preotact(TM)Pen).  The PreotactPen is specifically designed to allow osteoporosis patients to administer the injections, despite challenges of vision impairment and limited strength of hands and digits tributable to high age.  Patients should receive supplemental [[calcium]] and [[vitamin D]] during treatment with parathyroid hormone.
Following treatment with Preotact, patients can be treated with a [[bisphosphonate]] to further increase [[bone mineral density|bone mineral densisty]]

== Contraindications for use ==
Parathyroid hormone treatment should not be initiated in patients:
* with hypersensitivity to PTH or excipients
* who have received [[radiation therapy]] to the skeleton
* with pre-existing [[hypercalcemia]] and other disturbances in the [[metabolism]] of [[phosphate]] or [[calcium]]
* with metabolic bone diseases other than primary osteoporosis (including [[hyperparathyroidism]] and [[Paget's disease of bone|Paget's disease]]
* with unexplained elevations of bone-specific [[alkaline phosphatase]]
* with severe [[renal impairment]]
*with severe [[Liver failure|hepatic impairment]]

== Interactions ==
Parathyroid hormone is a natural [[peptide]] that is not metabolised in the liver.  PTH is not [[Plasma protein binding|protein bound]] and has a low [[volume of distribution]], therefore no specific drug-drug interactions are suspected.  From the knowledge of the [[mechanism of action]], combined use of Preotact and [[cardiac glycoside]]s may predispose patients to [[digitalis]] toxicity if hypercalcemia develops.

==Undesirable effects==
Hypercalcemia and/or [[hypercalciuria]] reflect the known [[pharmacodynamic]] actions of PTH in the [[gastrointestinal tract]], the [[kidney]] and the [[skeleton]], and is therefore an expected undesirable effect. Nausea is another commonly reported adverse reaction to the use of PTH.

==Pharmacodynamic properties==

===Mechanism of action===
Preotact contains recombinant human parathyroid hormone which is identical to the '''full-length''' native 84-amino acid [[polypeptide]].
Physiological actions of PTH include stimulation of [[ossification|bone formation]] by direct effects on bone forming cells ([[osteoblast]]s) indirectly increasing the intestinal absorption of calcium and increasing the [[renal tubule|tubular reabsorption]] of calcium and excretion of phosphate by the kidney.

===Pharmacodynamic effects===
The skeletal effects of PTH depend upon the pattern of systemic exposure. Transient elevations in PTH levels after subcutaneous injection of Preotact stimulates new bone formation on [[trabecular bone|trabecular]] and [[cortical bone]] surfaces by preferential stimulation of osteoblastic activity over [[osteoclast]]ic activity.

===Effects on serum calcium concentrations===
PTH is the principal regulator of serum calcium [[hemostasis]]. In response to subcutaneous doses of Preotact (100 micrograms), serum total calcium levels increase gradually and reach peak concentration at approximately 6 to 8 hours after dosing. In general, serum calcium levels return to normal within 24 hours.

===Clinical efficacy===
In an 18 month [[double-blind]], [[placebo]] controlled study, the effects of Preotact on the fracture incidence in 2532 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis was studied. Approximately 19% of patients had a prevalent vertebral fracture at baseline and the mean lumbar [[bone mineral density|T-score]] of -3.0 in both active and placebo arm.
Compared to the placbo group, there was a 61% relative risk reduction of a new vertebral fracture at month 18 for the women in the Preotact group.
To prevent one or more new vertebral fractures, 48 women had to be treated for a median of 18 months for the total population. For patients who were already fractured, the [[number needed to treat]] (NNT) was 21.

===Effect on bone mineral density (BMD)===
In the same study mentioned above, Preotact increased BMD in the [[lumbar spine]] after 18 months treatment by 6.5% compared with a reduction by 0.3% in the placebo group. The difference was statistically significant. The increase of BMD in the hip was also statistically significant compared to placebo, but only around 1.0% at study endpoint. Continued treatment up to 24 months lead to a continued increase in BMD.

==Pharmacokinetics==

===Absorption===
Subcutaneous administration of PTH into the abdomen produces a rapid increase in plasma PTH levels which reaches peak at 1 to 2 hours after dosing. The mean half-life is approximately 1.5 hours. The absolute bioavailability of 100 micrograms of Preotact after subcutaneous administration in the abdomen is 55%.

===Distribution===
The volume of distribution at [[Steady state (chemistry)|steady-state]] following intravenous administration is approximately 5.4 liters. Intersubject variability is about 40%.

===Biotransformation===
Parathyroid hormone is efficiently removed from the blood by a [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]-mediated process in the liver and is broken down into smaller peptide fragments. The fragments derived from the [[N-terminal|amino-terminus]] are further degraded within the cell while the fragments derived from the [[C-terminal end|carboxy-terminus]] are released back into the blood and cleared by the kidney. These carboxy-terminal fragments are thought to play a role in the regulation of PTH activity. Under normal physiological conditions full-length PTH constitutes only 5-30% of the circulating forms of the molecule, while 70-95% is present as carboxy-terminal fragments. Following administration of Preotact, carboxy-terminal fragments make up about 60-90% of the circulating forms of the molecule. Intersubject variability in systemic [[Clearance (medicine)|clearance]] is about 15%.

===Elimination===
PTH is metabolised in the liver and to a lesser extent in the kidney. It is not excreted from the body in its intact form. Circulating carboxy-terminal fragments are filtered by the kidney, but are subsequently broken down into even smaller fragments during tubular reuptake. No studies have so far been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of PTH in patients with severe renal insufficiency ([[creatinine clearance]] of less than 30 ml/min) has not been investigated either.

==Pharmaceutical particulars==
[[Image:preotact ampoule.gif|none|300px|right|Preotact drug cartridge]]
Preotact is delivered in a two chamber, glass [[ampoule]]. One chamber contains the active substance in the form of a white powder (with [[excipient]]s: [[mannitol]], [[citric acid]] monohydrate, [[Sodium chloride|NaCl]], [[NaOH]], [[Hydrochloric acid|HCl]]). And the other contains the solvent; water for injection. The powder is mixed with the solvent when the ampoule is insterted into the injection device.

==Storage and shelf-life==
The mixed solution is stable for 28 days when stored between 2 and 8&nbsp;Â°C. During this 28-day period the mixed solution may be stored for up to 7 days at room temperature, allowing the patient the freedom to travel.
Unmixed ampolues have a shelf-life of 30 months. The products should not be frozen and should be protected from light.
