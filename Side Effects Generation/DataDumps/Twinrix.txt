'''Twinrix''' is a [[vaccine]] against [[hepatitis A]] and [[hepatitis B]], manufactured by [[GlaxoSmithKline]]. Twinrix is administered over three doses.

The name was created because it is a mixture of two earlier vaccines — Havrix, an inactivated-virus [[Hepatitis A vaccine]], and [[Engerix-B]], a recombinant [[Hepatitis B vaccine]]. Twinrix, Havrix and Engerix-B are registered [[trademark]]s of [[GlaxoSmithKline]]; if the same vaccine is available from others, it will have another name. Twinrix first entered the market in early 1997.{{cn|date=August 2016}}

==Administration schedule==
Twinrix can be administered on the same schedule as monovalent Hepatitis B vaccine: at 0- 1- and 6- months.  In some circumstances, an accelerated dosing schedule of 0- 7- and 21-to 30- days followed by a booster at 12 months can be used and is believed to have similar efficacy as the traditional schedule.<ref>http://us.gsk.com/products/assets/us_twinrix.pdf</ref>

==Efficacy==
The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] reports that clinical trials found the following levels of protection against Hep A and Hep B one month after each dose:<ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=FDA approval for a combined hepatitis A and B vaccine |journal=MMWR Morb. Mortal. Wkly. Rep. |volume=50 |issue=37 |pages=806–7 |date=September 2001 |pmid=11785573 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5037a4.htm }}</ref>
:A: 93.8%, 98.8%, 99.9%
:B: 30.8%, 78.2%, 98.5%
GlaxoSmithKline claims that its studies found 70% of subjects had antibodies against hepatitis B a month after just the first dose, however.<ref>[http://emc.medicines.org.uk/emc/assets/c/html/displaydoc.asp?documentid=2061#PHARMACOLOGICAL_PROPS Twinrix Adult Vaccine, SPC from the eMC<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
