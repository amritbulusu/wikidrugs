The company is withdrawing retigabine from clinical use in 2017.

==Adverse effects==
The [[adverse drug reaction|adverse effects]] found in the Phase II trial mainly affected the central nervous system, and appeared to be dose-related.<ref name=Ben-Menachem/> The most common adverse effects were [[somnolence|drowsiness]], [[dizziness]], [[tinnitus]] and [[vertigo]], confusion, and [[dysarthria|slurred speech]].<ref name=Plosker/> Less common side effects included [[tremor]], memory loss, [[gait]] disturbances, and [[diplopia|double vision]].<ref name=Porter/>
In 2013 FDA warned the public that, Potiga (ezogabine) can cause blue skin discoloration and eye abnormalities characterized by pigment changes in the retina. FDA does not currently know if these changes are reversible. FDA is working with the manufacturer to gather and evaluate all available information to better understand these events. FDA will update the public when more information is available.<ref name=FDA>{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm349847.htm | title = Potiga (Ezogabine): Drug Safety Communication}}</ref>

==Interactions==
Retigabine appears to be free of [[drug interaction]]s with most commonly used anticonvulsants. It may increase metabolism of [[lamotrigine]] (Lamictal), whereas [[phenytoin]] (Dilantin) and [[carbamazepine]] (CBZ, Tegretol) increase the [[clearance (medicine)|clearance]] of retigabine.<ref name=eMC/><ref name=Luszczki/>

Concomitant use of retigabine and [[digoxin]] may increase serum concentration of the latter. ''In vitro'' studies suggest that the main metabolite of retigabine acts as a [[P-glycoprotein]] inhibitor, and may thus increase absorption and reduce elimination of digoxin.<ref name=eMC/>

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===
Retigabine acts as a neuronal [[voltage-gated potassium channel#Classification|KCNQ]]/[[voltage-gated potassium channel#Classification|Kv7]] [[potassium channel opener]], a mechanism of action markedly different from that of any current anticonvulsants.<ref name="pmid9384239"/><ref name="pmid10908292"/><ref name=Rogawski2008/> This mechanism of action is similar to that of the chemically-similar [[flupirtine]],<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=19298256|year=2009|last1=Brown|first1=DA|last2=Passmore|first2=GM|title=Neural KCNQ (Kv7) channels|volume=156|issue=8|pages=1185–95|doi=10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00111.x|pmc=2697739|journal=[[British Journal of Pharmacology]]}}</ref> which is used mainly for its analgesic properties.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Retigabine is quickly absorbed, and reaches maximum plasma concentrations between half an hour and 2 hours after a single oral dose. It has a moderately high oral [[bioavailability]] (50–60%), a high [[volume of distribution]] (6.2&nbsp;L/kg), and a [[biological half-life|terminal half-life]] of 8 to 11 hours.<ref name=Luszczki/> Retigabine requires thrice-daily dosing due to its short half-life.<ref name=Ben-Menachem/><ref name=Plosker/><ref name=eMC/>

Retigabine is [[drug metabolism|metabolized]] in the liver, by ''N''-[[glucuronidation]] and [[acetylation]]. The [[cytochrome P450]] system is not involved. Retigabine and its metabolites are excreted almost completely (84%) by the kidneys.<ref name=eMC/><ref name=Luszczki>{{cite journal |author=Łuszczki JJ |title=Third-generation antiepileptic drugs: mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics and interactions |journal=Pharmacology Reports |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=197–216 |year=2009 |pmid=19443931 |url=http://www.if-pan.krakow.pl/pjp/pdf/2009/2_197.pdf |doi=10.1016/s1734-1140(09)70024-6}}</ref>

==History==
<!--Retigabine was developed in [[East Germany]]-->
Among the newer anticonvulsants, retigabine was one of the most widely studied in the [[pre-clinical development|preclinical]] setting: it was the subject of over 100 published studies before clinical trials began. In preclinical tests, it was found to have a very broad spectrum of activity—being effective in nearly all the [[animal model]]s of seizures and epilepsy used: retigabine suppresses seizures induced by electroshock, electrical [[kindling model|kindling]] of the [[amygdala]], [[pentylenetetrazol]], [[kainic acid|kainate]], [[NMDA]], and [[picrotoxin]].<ref name=Rogawski2006>{{cite journal |author=Rogawski MA |title=Diverse Mechanisms of Antiepileptic Drugs in the Development Pipeline |journal=Epilepsy Research |volume=69 |issue=3 |pages=273–94 |date=June 2006 |pmid=16621450 |pmc=1562526 |doi=10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2006.02.004}}</ref> Researchers hoped this wide-ranging activity would translate to studies in humans as well.<ref name=Ben-Menachem>{{cite journal |author=Ben-Menachem E |title=Retigabine: Has the Orphan Found a Home? |journal=Epilepsy Currents |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=153–4 |year=2007 |pmid=18049722 |pmc=2096728 |doi=10.1111/j.1535-7511.2007.00209.x}}</ref>

===Clinical trials===
In a [[double-blind]], [[randomized controlled trial|randomized, placebo-controlled]] [[clinical trial#Phase II|Phase II]] clinical trial, retigabine was added to the treatment regimen of 399 participants with partial seizures that were refractory to therapy with other antiepileptic drugs. The frequency with which seizures occurred was [[statistical significance|significantly]] reduced (by 23 to 35%) in participants receiving retigabine, and approximately one fourth to one third of participants had their seizure frequency reduced by more than 50%. Higher doses were associated with a greater response to treatment.<ref name=Ben-Menachem/><ref name=Porter>{{cite journal |vauthors=Porter RJ, Partiot A, Sachdeo R, Nohria V, Alves WM |title=Randomized, multicenter, dose-ranging trial of retigabine for partial-onset seizures |journal=Neurology |volume=68 |issue=15 |pages=1197–204 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17420403 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000259034.45049.00}}</ref><ref name=Plosker>{{cite journal |vauthors=Plosker GL, Scott LJ |title=Retigabine: in partial seizures |journal=CNS Drugs |volume=20 |issue=7 |pages=601–8; discussion 609–10 |year=2006 |pmid=16800718 |doi=10.2165/00023210-200620070-00005}}</ref>

A [[clinical trial#Phase II|Phase II]] trial meant to assess the safety and efficacy of retigabine for treating [[postherpetic neuralgia]] was completed in 2009, but failed to meet its primary [[clinical endpoint|endpoint]]. Preliminary results were reported by Valeant as "inconclusive".<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.drugs.com/clinical_trials/valeant-pharmaceuticals-announces-preliminary-results-phase-iia-retigabine-study-postherpetic-7947.html |title=Valeant Pharmaceuticals Announces Preliminary Results From Its Phase IIa Retigabine Study for the Treatment of Postherpetic Neuralgia (PHN) |publisher=PRNewswire |date=2009-08-24 |accessdate=2011-06-13}}</ref>

===Regulatory approval===
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration accepted Valeant's [[New Drug Application]] for retigabine on December 30, 2009.<ref name="NDA">{{cite press release |url=http://www.drugs.com/nda/retigabine_091230.html |title=Retigabine NDA accepted for filing |publisher=PRNewswire |date=2009-12-30 |accessdate=2010-07-19}}</ref> The FDA Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee met on August 11, 2010 to discuss the process and unanimously recommended approval of Potiga for the intended indication (add-on treatment of partial seizures in adults).<ref name=Lowry2010>{{cite news |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/726809 |title=Epilepsy drug exogabine gets green light from FDA Advisory Panel |author=Lowry F |date=2010-08-12 |publisher=[[Medscape]] |accessdate=2010-08-13}}</ref><ref name=FDAAdvisory>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/Calendar/ucm217264.htm |title=August 11, 2010: Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee Meeting Announcement |author=[No authors listed] |date=2010-06-25 |publisher=U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] |accessdate=2010-07-19}}</ref> However, the possibility of [[urinary retention]] as an adverse effect was considered a significant concern, and the panel's members recommended that some sort of monitoring strategy be used to identify patients at risk of bladder dysfunction.<ref name=Lowry2010/> Potiga was approved by the FDA on June 10, 2010, but did not become available on the U.S. market until it had been [[Controlled Substances Act|scheduled]] by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]].<ref name=Hitt2011>{{cite news |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/726809 |title=FDA approves ezogabine for seizures in adults |author=Hitt E |date=2011-06-13 |publisher=[[Medscape]] |accessdate=2011-06-13}}</ref>

In December 2011, the U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) placed the substance into Schedule V of the [[Controlled Substances Act]] (CSA), the category for substances with a comparatively low potential for abuse. This became effective 15 December 2011.<ref>{{cite journal|author=U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-12-15/pdf/2011-32172.pdf|title=Schedules of Controlled Substances: Placement of Ezogabine Into Schedule V|date=15 December 2011|journal=Federal Register|volume=76|issue=241}}</ref>

==Name==
The [[International Nonproprietary Name]] "retigabine" was initially published as being under consideration by [[World Health Organization|WHO]] in 1996.<ref name=INN>{{cite journal | author = [[World Health Organization]] | title = International Nonproprietary Names for Pharmaceutical Substances (INN). Proposed INN: List 76 | journal = WHO Drug Information | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 215 | year = 1996 | url = http://whqlibdoc.who.int/inn/proposed_lists/prop_INN_list76.pdf}}</ref> This was later adopted as the ''recommended'' International Nonproprietary Name (rINN) for the drug, and, in 2005 or 2006, the [[USAN Council]]—a program sponsored by the American Medical Association, the United States Pharmacopeial Convention, and the American Pharmacists Association that chooses nonproprietary names for drug sold in the United States—adopted the same name.<ref name=USAN1>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/365/retigabine.pdf |title=Statement on a nonproprietary name adopted by the USAN council: Retigabine |author=[No authors listed] |year=2005–06 |publisher=[[American Medical Association]] |accessdate=2010-07-19}}</ref> In 2010, however, the USAN Council rescinded its previous decision and assigned "ezogabine" as the [[United States Adopted Name]] for the drug.<ref name=USAN2>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/365/ezogabine.pdf |title=Statement on a nonproprietary name adopted by the USAN council: Ezogabine |author=[No authors listed] |year=2010 |publisher=[[American Medical Association]] |accessdate=2010-07-19}}</ref> The drug will thus be known as "ezogabine" in the United States and "retigabine" elsewhere.
