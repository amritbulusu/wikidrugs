'''XLR-11''' ('''5"-fluoro-UR-144''') is a drug that acts as a potent [[agonist]] for the [[cannabinoid receptor]]s [[Cannabinoid receptor type 1|CB<sub>1</sub>]] and [[Cannabinoid receptor type 2|CB<sub>2</sub>]] with EC<sub>50</sub> values of 98 nM and 83 nM, respectively.<ref name="doi10.1021/acschemneuro.5b00107">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/acschemneuro.5b00107| title = Effects of Bioisosteric Fluorine in Synthetic Cannabinoid Designer Drugs JWH-018, AM-2201, UR-144, XLR-11, PB-22, 5F-PB-22, APICA, and STS-135| journal = ACS Chemical Neuroscience| pages = 150508124201002| year = 2015| last1 = Banister | first1 = S.

==Detection==

A forensic standard for this compound is available, and a representative mass spectrum has been posted on Forendex.<ref name="url__forendex">{{cite web | url = http://forendex.southernforensic.org/index.php/detail/index/1219%20XLR-11 | title =XLR-11 | work = Structural, chemical, and analytical data on controlled substances | publisher = Southern Association of Forensic Scientists (SAFS)  }}</ref>

==Recreational use==
XLR-11 was instead first identified by laboratories in 2012 as an ingredient in [[synthetic cannabis]] smoking blends, and appears to be a novel compound invented specifically for grey-market recreational use.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1071/CH14198| title = Bioisosteric Fluorine in the Clandestine Design of Synthetic Cannabinoids| journal = Australian Journal of Chemistry| volume = 68| pages = 4| year = 2015| last1 = Wilkinson | first1 = S.

==Legal Status==

XLR-11 was banned in New Zealand by being added to the [[temporary class drug]] schedule, effective from 13 July 2012.<ref name="url_New_Zealand_Gazette">{{cite web | url = http://www.dia.govt.nz/MSOS118/On-Line/NZGazette.nsf/6cee7698a9bbc7cfcc256d510059ed0b/1800482ea20e00f8cc257a32005ae9f8!OpenDocument | title = CB-13, MAM-2201, AKB48, and XLR11 are classified as temporary class drugs | date = 2012-07-05 | work = Temporary Class Drug Notice | publisher = The Department of Internal Affairs: New Zealand Gazette }}</ref>
