== Medical uses ==

=== Antifungal ===
One of the main uses of amphotericin B is treating a wide range of systemic [[Fungal infection in animals|fungal infection]]s. Due to its extensive side effects, it is often reserved for severe infections in critically ill, or [[immunocompromised]] patients. It is considered first line therapy for invasive [[mucormycosis]] infections, [[Cryptococcosis|cryptococcal meningitis]], and certain [[Aspergillosis|aspergillus]] and [[Candidiasis|candidal]] infections.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Drugs Active against Fungi, Pneumocystis, and Microsporidia|publisher = |year = |isbn = 978-1-4557-4801-3|location = |pages = 479–494.e4}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title = Liposomal Amphotericin B|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00003495-200969030-00010|journal = Drugs|date = 2012-09-17|issn = 0012-6667|pages = 361–392|volume = 69|issue = 3|doi = 10.2165/00003495-200969030-00010|first = Marit D.|last = Moen|first2 = Katherine A.|last2 = Lyseng-Williamson|first3 = Lesley J.|last3 = Scott|pmid=19275278}}</ref> It has been a highly effective drug for over fifty years in large part because it has a low incidence of drug resistance in the pathogens it treats. This is because amphotericin B resistance requires sacrifices on the part of the pathogen that make it susceptible to the host environment, and too weak to cause infection.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wi.mit.edu/news/archive/2013/understanding-evolution-drug-resistance-points-novel-strategy-developing-better|title=Understanding the evolution of drug resistance points to novel strategy for developing better antimicrobials|last=Rura|first=Nicole|date=2013-10-29|work=|access-date=2016-11-14|via=Whitehead Institute|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115134239/http://wi.mit.edu/news/archive/2013/understanding-evolution-drug-resistance-points-novel-strategy-developing-better|archivedate=2016-11-15|df=}}</ref> Lipid formulations of amphotericin B should not be used to treat urinary tract infections because they do not penetrate into the kidney or achieve adequate concentrations in the urine.<ref>Gary M Cox, Carol A Kaufmann;Candida infections of bladder and kidney.

=== Antiprotozoal ===
Amphotericin B is often used in otherwise-untreatable [[protozoan infections]] such as [[visceral leishmaniasis]]<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Treatment options for visceral leishmaniasis|journal = Expert Review of Anti-Infective Therapy|date = 2006-04-01|issn = 1744-8336|pmid = 16597201|pages = 187–197|volume = 4|issue = 2|doi = 10.1586/14787210.4.2.187|first = Margriet|last = den Boer|first2 = Robert N.|last2 = Davidson}}</ref> and [[primary amoebic meningoencephalitis]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Grace|first1=Eddie|last2=Asbill|first2=Scott|last3=Virga|first3=Kris|title=Naegleria fowleri: Pathogenesis, Diagnosis, and Treatment Options|journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy|date=November 2015|volume=59|issue=11|pages=6677–6681|doi=10.1128/AAC.01293-15|pmid=26259797|pmc=4604384}}</ref>

== Route of administration ==

=== Intravenous formulations ===
Amphotericin B alone is [[Solubility|insoluble]] in [[Saline (medicine)|normal saline]] at a [[pH]] of 7. Therefore, several formulations have been devised to improve its intravenous bioavailability.<ref name=":7" />

==== Deoxycholate ====
The original formulation uses sodium [[Deoxycholic acid|deoxycholate]] to improve solubility.<ref name=":0"/> Amphotericin B deoxycholate (ABD) is administered [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]], though with frequent adverse effects as detailed in the side effects section.<ref name=":1" /> As the original formulation of amphotericin, it is often referred to as "conventional" amphotericin.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Comparison of Fungizone, Amphotec, AmBisome, and Abelcet for Treatment of Systemic Murine Cryptococcosis|date = April 1998|journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy|doi = |pmid = 9559804|pmc=105563 |volume=42 |pages=899–902 | last1 = Clemons | first1 = KV | last2 = Stevens | first2 = DA}}</ref>

==== Liposomal formulations ====
In order to improve the tolerability of amphotericin and reduce toxicity, several lipid formulations have been developed.<ref name=":0" /> Liposomal formulations have been found to have less renal toxicity than deoxycholate,<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010481.pub2/abstract|title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|last=Botero Aguirre|first=Juan Pablo|last2=Restrepo Hamid|first2=Alejandra Maria|date=2015-11-23|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd010481.pub2|quote=|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220093637/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010481.pub2/abstract|archivedate=2016-12-20|df=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mistro|first=Sóstenes|last2=Maciel|first2=Isis de M.|last3=Menezes|first3=Rouseli G. de|last4=Maia|first4=Zuinara P.|last5=Schooley|first5=Robert T.|last6=Badaró|first6=Roberto|date=2012-06-15|title=Does Lipid Emulsion Reduce Amphotericin B Nephrotoxicity?

===By mouth===
A major barrier to the use of amphotericin in resource-poor settings is that it must be given intravenously (except for topical applications).

==Side effects==
Amphotericin B is well known for its severe and potentially lethal side effects. Very often, it causes a serious reaction soon after infusion (within 1 to 3 hours), consisting of high fever, shaking chills, [[hypotension]], [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[headache]], [[dyspnea]] and [[tachypnea]], [[drowsiness]], and generalized weakness. The violent chills and fevers have been nicknamed "shake and bake".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Shake+and+Bake|title=Shake and Bake|newspaper=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2016-12-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chem.uwec.edu/chem491_w09/ambliposomereview.pdf|title=Studies on Amphotericin B|last=Hartsel|first=Scott|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=8 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220113409/http://www.chem.uwec.edu/chem491_w09/ambliposomereview.pdf|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=}}</ref> This reaction sometimes subsides with later applications of the drug, and may in part be due to histamine liberation. An increase in [[prostaglandin]] synthesis may also play a role. This nearly universal febrile response necessitates a critical (and diagnostically difficult) professional determination as to whether the onset of high fever is a novel symptom of a fast-progressing disease, or merely the effect of the drug. To decrease the likelihood and severity of the symptoms, initial doses should be low, and increased slowly. [[Paracetamol]], [[pethidine]], [[diphenhydramine]], and [[hydrocortisone]] have all been used to treat or prevent the syndrome, but the prophylactic use of these drugs is often limited by the patient's condition.

Intravenously administered amphotericin B in therapeutic doses has also been associated with multiple organ damage. [[Nephrotoxicity|Kidney damage]] is a frequently reported side effect, and can be severe and/or irreversible. Less kidney toxicity has been reported with liposomal formulations (such as AmBisome) and it has become preferred in patients with preexisting renal injury.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Liposomal Amphotericin B for Empirical Therapy in Patients with Persistent Fever and Neutropenia|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJM199903113401004|journal = New England Journal of Medicine|date = 1999-03-11|issn = 0028-4793|pmid = 10072411|pages = 764–771|volume = 340|issue = 10|doi = 10.1056/NEJM199903113401004|first = Thomas J.|last = Walsh|first2 = Robert W.|last2 = Finberg|first3 = Carola|last3 = Arndt|first4 = John|last4 = Hiemenz|first5 = Cindy|last5 = Schwartz|first6 = David|last6 = Bodensteiner|first7 = Peter|last7 = Pappas|first8 = Nita|last8 = Seibel|first9 = Richard N.|last9 = Greenberg}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title = Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Cryptococcal Disease: 2010 Update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America|url = http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/50/3/291|journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases|date = 2010-02-01|issn = 1058-4838|pmid = 20047480|pages = 291–322|volume = 50|issue = 3|doi = 10.1086/649858|first = John R.|last = Perfect|first2 = William E.|last2 = Dismukes|first3 = Francoise|last3 = Dromer|first4 = David L.|last4 = Goldman|first5 = John R.|last5 = Graybill|first6 = Richard J.|last6 = Hamill|first7 = Thomas S.|last7 = Harrison|first8 = Robert A.|last8 = Larsen|first9 = Olivier|last9 = Lortholary|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160521004400/http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/50/3/291|archivedate = 2016-05-21|df = }}</ref> The integrity of the liposome is disrupted when it binds to the fungal cell wall, but is not affected by the mammalian cell membrane,<ref>Jill Adler-Moore,* and Richard T. liposomal formulation, structure, mechanism of action and pre-clinical experience.

Skin reactions, including serious forms, are also possible.

==Interactions==
* [[Flucytosine]]: Toxicity of flucytosine is increased and allows a lower dose of amphotericin B. Amphotericin B may also facilitate entry of flucystosine into the fungal cell by interfering with the permeability of the fungal cell membrane.
* Diuretics or [[cisplatin]]: Increased renal toxicity and increased risk of hypokalemia
* [[Corticosteroid]]s: Increased risk of hypokalemia
* Cytostatic drugs: Increased risk of kidney damage, hypotension, and bronchospasms
* Other nephrotoxic drugs (such as aminoglycosides): Increased risk of serious renal damage
* [[Foscarnet]], [[ganciclovir]], [[tenofovir]], [[adefovir]]: Risk of hematological and renal side effects of amphotericin B are increased
* Transfusion of leukocytes: Risk of pulmonal (lung) damage occurs, space the intervals between the application of amphotericin B and the transfusion, and monitor pulmonary function

==Mechanism of action==
Amphotericin B binds with [[ergosterol]], a component of fungal cell membranes, forming pores that cause rapid leakage of [[monovalent ion]]s ([[potassium|K<sup>+</sup>]], [[sodium|Na<sup>+</sup>]], [[hydrogen|H<sup>+</sup>]] and [[chloride|Cl<sup>−</sup>]]) and subsequent fungal cell death. This is amphotericin B's primary effect as an antifungal agent.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|title = It only takes one to do many jobs: Amphotericin B as antifungal and immunomodulatory drug|url = http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmicb.2012.00286/abstract|journal = Fungi and Their Interactions|date = 2012-01-01|pmc = 3441194|pmid = 23024638|pages = 286|volume = 3|doi = 10.3389/fmicb.2012.00286|first = Ana Cecilia|last = Mesa-Arango|first2 = Liliana|last2 = Scorzoni|first3 = Oscar|last3 = Zaragoza|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117173202/http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmicb.2012.00286/abstract|archivedate = 2015-11-17|df = }}</ref><ref name="O'Keeffe">{{Cite journal|title = Exposure of the yeast Candida albicans to the anti-neoplastic agent adriamycin increases the tolerance to amphotericin B|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1211/0022357022359/abstract|journal = Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology|date = 2003-12-01|issn = 2042-7158|pages = 1629–1633|volume = 55|issue = 12|doi = 10.1211/0022357022359|first = Joseph|last = O'Keeffe|first2 = Sean|last2 = Doyle|first3 = Kevin|last3 = Kavanagh|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151204084917/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1211/0022357022359/abstract|archivedate = 2015-12-04|df = }}</ref> It has been found that the amphotericin B/ergosterol bimolecular complex that maintains these pores is stabilized by Van der Waals interactions.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Molecular modelling of amphotericin B-ergosterol primary complex in water II|journal=Biophysical Chemistry|volume=141}}</ref> Researchers have found evidence that amphotericin B also causes [[oxidative stress]] within the fungal cell,<ref name=Baginski2009>{{cite journal |last1= Baginski |first1= M. |last2= Czub |first2= J. |title= Amphotericin B and Its New Derivatives–Mode of Action |journal= Current Drug Metabolism |volume= 10 |issue= 5 |year= 2009 |pages= 459–69 |pmid= 19689243 |doi=10.2174/138920009788898019}}</ref> but it remains unclear to what extent this oxidative damage contributes to the drug's effectiveness.<ref name=":3"/> The addition of [[free radical]] scavengers or [[antioxidant]]s can lead to amphotericin resistance in some species, such as ''[[Scedosporium prolificans]]'', without affecting the cell wall.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Two amphotericins, amphotericin A and amphotericin B, are known, but only B is used clinically, because it is significantly more active ''[[in vivo]]''.  Amphotericin A is almost identical to amphotericin B (having a C=C double bond between the 27th and 28th carbons), but has little antifungal activity.<ref name=":7" />

==Mechanism of toxicity==
Mammalian and fungal membranes both contain sterols, a primary membrane target for amphotericin B. Because mammalian and fungal membranes are similar in structure and composition, this is one mechanism by which amphotericin B causes cellular toxicity. Amphotericin B molecules can form pores in the host membrane as well as the fungal membrane. This impairment in membrane barrier function can have lethal effects.<ref name=Baginski2009/><ref name="Laniado-Laborin R 2009">Laniado-Laborin R. and Cabrales-Vargas MN.
