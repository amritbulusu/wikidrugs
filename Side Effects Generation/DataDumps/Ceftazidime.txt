==Medical uses==
Ceftazidime is used to treat lower respiratory tract, skin, urinary tract, blood-stream, joint, and abdominal infections, and meningitis.<ref name="Sagent"/> 
The drug is given [[intravenous|intravenously (IV)]] or [[intramuscular|intramuscularly (IM)]] every 8–12 hours (two or three times a day), with dose and frequencing varying by the type of infection, severity, and/or renal function of the patient. Ceftazidime is also commonly prescribed off-label for nebulization in Cystic Fibrosis patients for the suppression of Pseudomonas in the lungs as well as the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations. Those with kidney disease are dosed less frequently.<ref name="Sagent"/>

Ceftazidime is the first-line treatment for the tropical infection, [[melioidosis]], an important cause of sepsis in Asia and Australia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=White NJ |title=Melioidosis |journal=Lancet |year=2003| volume=361| pages=1715–722| pmid=12767750 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13374-0 |issue=9370}}</ref>

Labeled indications include the treatment of patients with: 
* ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' infections
* other Gram-negative, aerobic infections
* neutropenic fever<ref name="Lexi"/>

As a class, cephalosporins have activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.  The balance of activity tips toward Gram-positive organisms for earlier generations; later generations of cephalosporins have more Gram-negative coverage.  Ceftazidime is one of the few in this class with activity against ''Pseudomonas''.  It is not active against methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus''.

=== Spectrum of activity ===
Clinically relevant organisms against which ceftazidime has activity include:
*'''Gram-negative aerobes''', such as ''Enterobacter'', ''E. coli'', ''H. influenzae'', ''Klebsiella'', ''Proteus'', ''Pseudomonas'', and ''N. meningitidis''
*'''Gram-positive aerobes''', such as group B streptococci, ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'', and ''Streptococcus pyogenes''
*'''Anaerobes''', such as ''Bacteroides''<ref name="Sagent"/>
The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few clinically significant pathogens:
* ''Escherichia coli'' – 0.015&nbsp;µg/mL – 512&nbsp;µg/mL
* ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' – ≤0.03&nbsp;µg/mL – 1024&nbsp;µg/mL <ref>http://www.toku-e.com/Assets/MIC/Ceftazidime%20pentahydrate.pdf</ref>

== Side effects ==
Ceftazidime is generally well-tolerated.  When side effects do occur, they are most commonly local effects from the intravenous line site, allergic reactions, and gastrointestinal symptoms. According to one manufacturer, in clinical trials, allergic reactions including itching, rash, and fever, happened in fewer than 2% of patients. Rare but more serious allergic reactions, such as [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]], [[Stevens-Johnson syndrome]], and [[erythema multiforme]], have been reported with this class of antibiotics, including ceftazidime. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, were reported in fewer than 2% of patients.<ref name="Sagent"/>

Another source reported, in addition, blood tests of patients may show increased eosinophils (8%), increased lactate dehydrogenase (6%), increased gamma-glutamyl transferase (5%), positive direct Coombs test (4%), increased platelets (thrombocythemia) (2%), increased ALT (7%), increased AST (6%), or increased alkaline phosphatase (4%).<ref name="Lexi">Lexicomp Online, Lexi-Drugs, Hudson, Ohio: Lexi-Comp, Inc.; 2014; April 20, 2014. {{cite web |url=http://online.lexi.com/lco/action/doc/retrieve/docid/patch_f/6560 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423041750/http://online.lexi.com/lco/action/doc/retrieve/docid/patch_f/6560 |archivedate=2014-04-23 |df= }}</ref>

=== Contraindications ===
Ceftazidime is contraindicated in people with a known allergy to ceftazidime or to any other cephalosporin antibiotic.<ref name="Sagent"/>

=== Precautions ===
Ceftazidime is mainly eliminated by the kidneys into the urine.  As such, drug levels in the blood may build up in persons with kidney injury or kidney disease.  This includes those on dialysis.  In these cases of renal impairment, the drug is dosed less frequently.<ref name="Lexi"/>  No dose adjustment is needed for those with liver disease.

=== Pregnancy ===
Ceftazidime falls under the [[pregnancy category]] B.<ref name="Lexi"/>  According to the manufacturer, research studies in mice and rats showed no evidence of harm to the fetus, even at up to 40 times the human dose of ceftazidime.  Importantly, though, no high-quality research studies of the effects of the drug in pregnant women were conducted.<ref name="Sagent">Ceftazidime for Injection(R) [package insert].

==Mechanism of action==
Third-generation cephalosporins differ from earlier generations in the presence of a C=N-OCH<sub>3</sub> group in their chemical structure ([[cefuroxime]] & [[Cefuzonam]] also bear this [[functional group]] but are only listed as class II). This group provides improved stability against certain [[beta-lactamase]] enzymes produced by Gram-negative bacteria. These bacterial enzymes rapidly destroy earlier-generation cephalosporins by breaking open the drug's beta-lactam chemical ring, leading to antibiotic resistance. Though initially active against these bacteria, with widespread use of third-generation cephalosporins, some Gram-negative bacteria known as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are even able to inactivate the third-generation cephalosporins. Infections caused by ESBL-producing Gram-negative bacteria are of particular concern in hospitals and other healthcare facilities.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sharma M, Pathak S, Srivastava P |title=Prevalence and antibiogram of Extended Spectrum β-Lactamase (ESBL) producing Gram negative bacilli and further molecular characterization of ESBL producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp |journal=J Clin Diagn Res |volume=7 |issue=10 |pages=2173–7 |date=October 2013  |pmid=24298468 |pmc=3843424 |doi=10.7860/JCDR/2013/6460.3462 |url=}}</ref>

==Chemistry==
In addition to the ''syn''-configuration of the [[imino]] [[side chain]], compared to other third-generation cephalosporins, the more complex moiety (containing two [[methyl]] and a [[carboxylic acid]] group) confers extra stability to [[beta-lactamase|β-lactamase]] enzymes produced by many [[Gram-negative]] bacteria. The extra stability to β-lactamases increases the activity of ceftazidime against otherwise resistant Gram-negative organisms including ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''. The charged [[pyridine|pyridinium]] moiety increases water-solubility. Ceftazidime shares the same variable R-group side chain with [[aztreonam]], a [[monobactam]] antibiotic; the two drugs share a similar spectrum of activity, including activity against Pseudomonas.
