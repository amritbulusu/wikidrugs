'''DET''', also known under its chemical name '''''N'',''N''-diethyltryptamine''' and as '''T-9''',<ref name="titleErowid DET Vault : Chemistry">{{cite web |url=http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/det/det_chemistry.shtml |title=Erowid DET Vault : Chemistry |accessdate=2008-01-08 |work=}}</ref> is a [[psychedelic drug]] closely related to [[dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] and [[4-HO-DET]]. However, despite its [[Analog (chemistry)|structural similarity]] to DMT, its activity is induced by an oral dose of around 50–100 [[Milligram|mg]], without the aid of [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAO inhibitors]], and the effects last for about 2–4 hours.

==Chemistry==
DET is an analogue of the common [[tryptamine]] hallucinogen [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine]] or DMT. 

==Pharmacology==
{{Refimprove|section|date=October 2013}}

The mechanism of action is thought to be [[5-HT receptor|serotonin receptor]] [[agonist|agonism]], much like other [[Psychedelic drug#Examples|classic psychedelics]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Winter JC |title=Behavioral effects of N,N-diethyltryptamine: absence of antagonism by xylamidine tosylate |journal=J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. |volume=169 |issue=1 |pages=7–16 |date=September 1969 |pmid=5306645 |doi= |url=http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=5306645}}</ref>

DET is sometimes preferred over DMT because it can be taken orally, whereas DMT cannot. This is because the enzyme [[monoamine oxidase]] degrades DMT into an inactive compound before it is absorbed. To overcome this, it must be administered in a different manner, i.e. intravenously, intramuscularly, by inhalation, by insufflation, rectally, or ingested along with an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase. Because DET has ethyl groups attached to its nitrogen atom, monoamine oxidase is unable to degrade it. This is also true for many other tryptamines with larger nitrogen substituents.

==Biochemistry==
Although DET is a [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] compound with no known [[Psychedelic plants|natural sources]], it has been used in conjunction with the [[mycelium]] of ''[[Psilocybe cubensis]]'' to produce the synthetic chemicals [[4-PO-DET|4-PO-DET (Ethocybin)]] and [[4-HO-DET|4-HO-DET (Ethocin)]], as opposed to the naturally occurring [[4-PO-DMT|4-PO-DMT (Psilocybin)]] and [[4-HO-DMT|4-HO-DMT (Psilocin)]]. Isolation of the alkaloids resulted in 3.3% 4-HO-DET and 0.01-0.8% 4-PO-DET.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gartz J |title=Biotransformation of tryptamine derivatives in mycelial cultures of Psilocybe |journal=J. Basic Microbiol. |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=347–52 |year=1989 |pmid=2614674 |doi= 10.1002/jobm.3620290608|url=}}</ref>

==Psychosis model==
Early studies of DET as well as other psychedelics were mainly focused on their presumed [[psychotomimetic]] properties.<ref name="titlePSILOCYBIN AND DIETHYLTRYPTAMINE:
TWO TRYPTAMINE HALLUCINOGENS">{{cite web |url=http://www.erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?A=ShowDoc1&ID=2633 |title=PSILOCYBIN AND DIETHYLTRYPTAMINE: TWO TRYPTAMINE HALLUCINOGENS |accessdate=2008-01-03 |format= |work=}}</ref> Researchers theorized that abnormal [[metabolite]]s of endogenous chemicals such as [[tryptamine]], [[serotonin]], and [[tryptophan]] could be the explanation for [[mental disorder]]s  such as [[schizophrenia]], or [[psychosis]].<ref name="title">{{cite web |url=http://www.erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?A=ShowDoc1&ID=2360 |title=Effects of LSD-25, N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and N,N-Diethyltryptamine (DET) on the Photic Evoked Responses in the unanesthetized Rabbit |accessdate=2008-01-03 |format= |work=}}</ref> With the progression of science and [[pharmacological]] understanding, this belief has been dismissed by most researchers.

==Legal status==
Internationally DET is a Schedule I drug under the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/green.pdf |title= List of psychotropic substances under international control |accessdate=30 March 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070302130637/http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/green.pdf| archivedate= 2 March 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Australia===
DET is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the [[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons|Poisons Standard]] (October 2015).<ref name="Poisons Standard">Poisons Standard October 2015 https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2015L01534</ref> A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.
