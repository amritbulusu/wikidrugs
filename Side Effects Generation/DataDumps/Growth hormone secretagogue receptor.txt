It is very interesting then, as mentioned above, that orexin, leptin, and ghrelin receptors are expressed in the VTA, and MC4 and MCH receptors are enriched in the nucleus accumbens. There is increasing evidence that some of the actions of these feeding peptides are mediated at the level of the VTA-NAc circuit: recent studies, for example, have shown that injection of leptin into the VTA suppresses feeding behavior, while RNAi (RNA interference; Chapter 4) mediated-knockdown of leptin receptors in the VTA increases food intake, sensitivity to highly palatable foods, and locomotor activity. --> }}</ref>

== Function ==
Ghrelin is an appetite-regulating factor secreted from peripheral organs that is involved in regulation of energy homoeostasis via binding to the receptor resulting in the secretion of growth hormone by the pituitary gland.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wren AM, Small CJ, Ward HL, Murphy KG, Dakin CL, Taheri S, Kennedy AR, Roberts GH, Morgan DG, Ghatei MA, Bloom SR | title = The novel hypothalamic peptide ghrelin stimulates food intake and growth hormone secretion | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 141 | issue = 11 | pages = 4325–8 | date = Nov 2000 | pmid = 11089570 | doi = 10.1210/endo.141.11.7873 | url = http://endo.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11089570 }}</ref> The pathway activated by binding of ghrelin to the growth hormone secretagogue receptor,  GHS-R1a, regulates the activation of the downstream [[mitogen-activated protein kinase]], [[Akt]], [[nitric oxide synthase]], and [[AMP-activated protein kinase|AMPK]] cascades in different cellular systems.<ref name="pazos2007"/> One of the important features of GHS-R1a displays [[Receptor (biochemistry)#Binding and activation|constitutive activity]] possessing basal activity in the absence of an agonist, resulting in a high degree of receptor internalization as well as of signaling activity.<ref name="pazos2007"/> Inverse agonists for the ghrelin receptor could be particularly interesting for the treatment of obesity.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Holst B, Cygankiewicz A, Jensen TH, Ankersen M, Schwartz TW | title = High constitutive signaling of the ghrelin receptor--identification of a potent inverse agonist | journal = Molecular Endocrinology | volume = 17 | issue = 11 | pages = 2201–10 | date = Nov 2003 | pmid = 12907757 | doi = 10.1210/me.2003-0069 }}</ref> This activity seems to provide a tonic signal required for the development of normal height, probably through an effect on the GH axis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pantel J, Legendre M, Cabrol S, Hilal L, Hajaji Y, Morisset S, Nivot S, Vie-Luton MP, Grouselle D, de Kerdanet M, Kadiri A, Epelbaum J, Le Bouc Y, Amselem S | title = Loss of constitutive activity of the growth hormone secretagogue receptor in familial short stature | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 116 | issue = 3 | pages = 760–8 | date = Mar 2006 | pmid = 16511605 | pmc = 1386106 | doi = 10.1172/JCI25303 }}</ref>

==Transcripts==

Two identified transcript variants are expressed in several tissues and are evolutionary conserved in fish and swine. One transcript, 1a, excises an intron and encodes the functional protein; this protein is the receptor for the ghrelin ligand and defines a neuroendocrine pathway for growth hormone release. The second transcript (1b) retains the intron and does not function as a receptor for ghrelin; however, it may function to attenuate activity of isoform 1a.<ref name="entrez">{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: GHS-R growth hormone secretagogue receptor| url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=2693| accessdate = }}</ref>

== Selective ligands ==
A range of selective ligands for the GHS-R receptor are now available and are being developed for several clinical applications. GHS-R agonists have appetite-stimulating and growth hormone-releasing effects, and are likely to be useful for the treatment of muscle wasting and frailty associated with old-age and degenerative diseases. On the other hand, GHS-R antagonists have [[anorectic]] effects and are likely to be useful for the treatment of [[obesity]].
