'''Flutamide''', sold under the brand name '''Eulexin''' among others, is a [[nonsteroidal antiandrogen]] (NSAA) used primarily to treat [[prostate cancer]].<ref name="IndexNominum2000">{{cite book|title=Index Nominum 2000: International Drug Directory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5GpcTQD_L2oC&pg=PA466|date=January 2000|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-3-88763-075-1|pages=466–}}</ref><ref name="Elks2014">{{cite book|author=J.

By doing so, it prevents them from stimulating the prostate cancer cells to grow.

==Medical uses==

===Prostate cancer===
GnRH is released by the [[hypothalamus]] in a [[pulsatile secretion|pulsatile]] fashion; this causes the [[anterior pituitary|anterior]] [[pituitary gland]] to release [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) and [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH). LH stimulates the [[testis|testes]] to produce testosterone, which is metabolized to DHT by the enzyme [[5α-reductase]].

DHT, and to a significantly smaller extent, testosterone, stimulate prostate cancer cells to grow. Therefore, blocking these androgens can provide powerful treatment for prostate cancer, especially metastatic disease. Normally administered are GnRH analogues, such as [[leuprorelin]] or [[cetrorelix]]. Although GnRH agonists stimulate the same receptors that GnRH does, since they are present continuously and not in a pulsatile manner, they serve to inhibit the pituitary gland and therefore block the whole chain. However, they initially cause a surge in activity; this is not solely a theoretical risk but may cause the cancer to flare. Flutamide was initially used at the beginning of GnRH agonist therapy to block this surge, and it and other NSAAs continue in this use. In contrast to GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists don't cause an initial androgen surge, and are gradually replacing GnRH agonists in clinical use.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

There have been studies to investigate the benefit of adding an antiandrogen to surgical [[orchiectomy]] or its continued use with a GnRH analogue ([[combined androgen blockade]] (CAB)). Adding antiandrogens to orchiectomy showed no benefit, while a small benefit was shown with adding antiandrogens to GnRH analogues.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Unfortunately, therapies which lower testosterone levels, such as orchiectomy or GnRH analogue administration, also have significant side effects. Compared to these therapies, treatment with antiandrogens exhibits "fewer hot flashes, less of an effect on libido, less muscle wasting, fewer personality changes, and less bone loss." However, antiandrogen therapy alone is less effective than surgery. Nevertheless, given the advanced age of many with prostate cancer, as well as other features, many men may choose antiandrogen therapy alone for a better quality of life.<ref name=Harrison>Scher, Howard I.

===Hyperandrogenism===
Flutamide has been researched and used extensively in the treatment of [[hyperandrogenism]] (e.g., in [[polycystic ovary syndrome]]) in women and is highly effective in controlling symptoms including [[acne]], [[seborrhea]], [[hirsutism]], and [[androgenetic alopecia]]. The dosages employed are lower than those used in the treatment of prostate cancer. Although flutamide continues to be used for this indication, its use in recent years has been limited due to the risk of potentially fatal hepatotoxicity, and it is not recommended as a first-line therapy.<ref name="Ostrzenski2002">{{cite book|author=Adam Ostrzenski|title=Gynecology: Integrating Conventional, Complementary, and Natural Alternative Therapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TYlZsGdwqrQC&pg=PA86|year=2002|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-2761-7|pages=86–}}</ref><ref name="Blume-PeytaviWhiting2008">{{cite book|author1=Ulrike Blume-Peytavi|author2=David A.

==Chemistry==
Unlike the hormones with which it competes, flutamide is not a [[steroid]]; rather, it is a substituted [[anilide]]. Hence, it is described as ''nonsteroidal'' in order to distinguish it from older steroidal antiandrogens such as [[cyproterone acetate]] and [[megestrol acetate]].
