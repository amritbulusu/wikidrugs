'''Dalfopristin''' is a semi-synthetic [[streptogramin]] [[antibiotic]] analogue of ostreogyrcin A ([[Virginiamycin|virginiamycin M]], [[pristinamycin|pristinamycin IIA]], [[streptogramin A]]).<ref name=scbt>[http://www.scbt.com/datasheet-362728.html Dalfopristin (as mesylate) (CAS 112362-50-2)]</ref>  The combination [[quinupristin/dalfopristin]] (marketed under the trade name [[Quinupristin/dalfopristin|Synercid]]) was brought to the market by [[Rhône-Poulenc|Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Pharmaceuticals]] in 1999.<ref name=fda>http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/99/50747_Synercid.cfm</ref> [[Synercid]] (weight-to-weight ratio of 30% [[quinupristin]] to 70% dalfopristin) is used to treat [[infection]]s by [[staphylococcus|staphylococci]] and by [[vancomycin]]-resistant ''[[Enterococcus|Enterococcus faecium]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0149-2918(01)80028-X | author = Allington DR, Rivey MP | title = Quinupristin/dalfopristin: a therapeutic review | journal = Clin Ther | year = 2001 | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 24–44 | pmid = 11219478}}</ref>

==Synthesis==
Through the [[addition]] of diethylaminoethylthiol to the 2-[[pyrroline]] group and [[oxidation]] of the [[sulfate]] of ostreogrycin A, a structurally more [[hydrophobic]] compound is formed. This [[hydrophobic]] compound contains a readily [[ionizable]] group that is available for salt formation.<ref name=scbt />

==Large Scale Preparation==
Dalfopristin is synthesized from [[Pristinamycine|pristinamycine IIa]] through achieving a stereoselective [[Michael addition|Michael-type addition]] of 2-diethylaminoethanethiol on the conjugated double bond of the dehydroproline ring <ref name=recentdevelopments>{{cite journal |last=Barriere |first=J.C. |last2=Berthaud |first2=N. |last3=Beyer |first3=D. |last4=Dutka-Malen |first4=S. |last5=Paris |first5=J.M. |last6=Desnottes |first6=J.F. |date=April 1998 |title=Recent Developments in Streptogramin Research |journal=Current Pharmaceutical Design |publisher= |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=155–190 |doi= |pmid=10197038}}</ref>
. The first method found was using [[sodium periodate]] associated with [[ruthenium dioxide]] to directly oxidize the sulfur derivative into a [[sulfone]]. However, using [[hydrogen peroxide]] with [[sodium tungstate]] in a 2-phase medium produces an improved yield, and is therefore the method of choice for large scale production.

The production of the dalfopristin portion of [[quinupristin/dalfopristin]] is achieved through purifying cocrystallization of the quinupristin and dalfopristin from [[acetone]] solutions.<ref name=recentdevelopments />

==Antimicrobial Activity==
Alone, both dalfopristin and [[quinupristin]] have modest [[in vitro]] [[bacteriostatic]] activity. However, 8-16 times higher in vitro [[bactericidal]] activity is seen against many [[gram-positive bacteria]] when the two [[streptogramins]] are combined <ref name=therapeuticreview>{{cite journal |last=Allington |first=Douglas R. |last2=Rivey |first2=Michael P. |date=January 2001 |title=Quinupristin/Dalfopristin: A Therapeutic Review |url= |journal=Clinical Therapeutics |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=1–21 |pmid=11219478  |doi=10.1016/S0149-2918(01)80028-X}}<!--|accessdate=24 November 2013 --></ref>
. While [[quinupristin/dalfopristin]] is effective against [[staphylococcus|staphylococci]] and [[Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus|vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium]], in vitro studies have not demonstrated bactericidal activity against all strains and species of common gram-positive bacteria.

==Mechanism of Action==
Both dalfopristin and quinupristin bind to sites located on the 50S subunit of the [[ribosome]]. Initial dalfopristin binding results in a conformational change of the ribosome, allowing for increased binding by quinupristin.<ref name=therapeuticreview /> A stable drug-ribosome complex is created when the two drugs are used together. This complex inhibits [[protein synthesis]] through prevention of peptide-chain formation and blocking the extrusion of newly formed peptide chains. In many cases, this leads to bacterial cell death.

==Mechanism of Resistance==
Streptogramin resistance is mediated through enzymatic drug inactivation, efflux or active transport of drug out of the cell, and most commonly, conformational alterations in ribosomal target binding sites.<ref name=therapeuticreview /> Enzymatic drug inactivation may occur in [[staphylococcal]] and [[enterococcal]] species through production of dalfopristin-inactivating acetyltransferase or quinupristin-inactivating hydrolase. Efflux or active transport of the drug may occur in coagulase-negative staphylococci and [[Enterococcus faecium]]. Constitutive ribosome modification has been seen in staphylococci with resistance seen in quinupristin only.

While resistance to dalfopristin may be conferred via a single point of mutation, [[quinupristin/dalfopristin]] offers the benefit of requiring multiple points of mutation targeting both dalfopristin and quinupristin components to confer drug resistance.<ref name=therapeuticreview /> Comparatively, only 2-5% of staphylococcal isolates collected in France show resistance to a related streptogramin, [[pristinamycin]], in over 35 years of use.

==Drug Interactions==
Both dalfopristin and quinupristin are extensively hepatically metabolized, excreted from the feces, and serve as an inhibitor of [[cytochrome P450]] (CYP) 3A4 enzyme pathway.<ref name=therapeuticreview /> Caution should be taken with concommitent use with drugs metabolized by the [[CYP3A4]] pathway. Concomitant use of [[quinupristin/dalfopristin]] with [[cyclosporine]] for 2–5 days has shown to result in a two-fold increase in cyclosporine levels.

No adverse effects have been seen in patients with [[hepatic impairment]] and no recommendations by the manufacturer have been made for dose reduction of [[quinupristin/dalfopristin]] in this patient population.

==Commercialization==
While little information is available regarding the regulatory and commercialization history of Dalfopristin alone, Synercid (quinupristin/dalfopristin), made by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Pharmaceuticals, was approved in 1999 as an IV injectable for the treatment of vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium and complicated skin and skin structure infections.<ref name=fda /> Dalfopristin can be purchased alone on the internet from various chemical manufacturers as a [[mesylate]] salt.
