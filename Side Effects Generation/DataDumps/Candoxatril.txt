== Studies ==
Candoxatril is the first drug of its kind to be released for clinical trials regarding heart failure.  This is because Candoxatril produces favorable haemodynamic effects in patients with chronic heart failure. It has been demonstrated that  Candoxatril is associated with a beneficial hemodynamic effect that is useful both in rest and exercise. In several different studies, candoxatril has been shown to improve performance in people with heart failure. In one study, 12 different patients were selected, all with moderately severe heart failure.  On day one of this study, the candoxatril had increased plasma ANP levels, suppressed aldosterone and decreased right atrial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures. After treatment for 10 days, patients health had improved with an increase of basal ANP and a decrease of aldosterone, along with a reduced body weight that could be a reflection of chronic natriuretic, diuretic effects, or both.  It was decided that on day 10 of the study, the effects of candoxatril were similar to that on day one.<ref>"Result Filters." National Center for Biotechnology Information. U.S. National Library of Medicine, n.d. Web. 23 Nov. 2015.</ref>

In a separate study, patients were gathered throughout the United Kingdom from 16 different centers. Over a four-week bind, the patients were either given candoxatril or placebo for the 84 days and every 28 days, patients were reassessed.  Out of the 110 patients, 56 received candoxatril and 54 received the placebo.  Over the time of the study, the patients who were taking candoxatril had an overall improvement in exercise time compared to the patients taking the placebo.<ref>McDowell, G., W. Coutie, C. Shaw, K. D. Buchanan, A. D. Struthers, and D. P. Nicholls. "The Effect of the Neutral Endopeptidase Inhibitor Drug, Candoxatril, on Circulating Levels of Two of the Most Potent Vasoactive Peptides." British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology. U.S. National Library of Medicine, n.d. Web. 23 Nov. 2015.</ref>

In a third study, there was only one patient who experienced worsening heart failure during this particular study.  However, the frequency wasn’t statistically significantly different from another observed group that was on placebo. Together, the results of this study show the candoxatril offers a new, effective therapeutic  in the treatment of people with mild heart failure. The beneficial effects may begin to  improve the well being of patients during everyday activities.<ref>McMurray, John. "Clinical Cardiology: New Frontiers." American Heart Association.
