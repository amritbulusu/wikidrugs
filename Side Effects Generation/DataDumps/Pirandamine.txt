==Synthesis==
[[File:Pirandamine synthesis.svg|thumb|center|700px|Pirandamine synthesis:<ref>I. Jirkovsky, L. G. Humber and R. Noureldin,Eur. J. Med. Chem., 11, 571 (1976).</ref>]]
Condensation of 1-[[indanone]] ('''1''') with [[ethyl bromoacetate]] and zinc affords [[Reformatsky reaction]] product '''2'''; then reduction with [[LiAlH4|LiAlH<sub>4</sub>]] gives diol '''3'''. Dehydration with [[H2SO4|H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>]] gives the indene ethanol '''4'''. Acid catalyzed condensation of '''4''' with ethyl acetoacetate then gives the fused tetrahydropyran derivative '''5''' (no doubt by a scheme quite analogous to [[prodolic acid]]). The ester is then saponified to the corresponding acid, which is then converted to the dimethylamide ('''6'''). Reduction with [[LiAlH4|LiAlH<sub>4</sub>]] completes the synthesis of the antidepressant agent pirandamine ('''7''').
