'''Teplizumab''' (also known as '''MGA031''' and '''hOKT3γ1(Ala-Ala)''') is a humanized [[monoclonal antibody]] that failed tests<ref>https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/quick_news/2010/10/macrogenics-lilly-abandon-diabetes-drug.html</ref> meant to show it is an [[immunosuppressive drug]]. The [[Fc region]] of this antibody has been engineered to have [[Fc receptor]] non-binding (FNB) properties. Teplizumab was originally developed at Columbia University, and was then further developed at MacroGenics, Inc.<ref name="pmid9636555">{{cite journal | vauthors = Woodle ES, Bluestone JA, Zivin RA, Jolliffe LK, Auger J, Xu D, Thistlethwaite JR | title = Humanized, nonmitogenic OKT3 antibody, huOKT3 gamma(Ala-Ala): initial clinical experience | journal = [[Transplant.

[[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] licensed the drug back in 2007 from MacroGenics with a $41 million upfront and a billion dollars pledged for milestones.

It is in Phase-3 clinical trials for Type-1 DM. 
One-year data from one phase III trial was disappointing.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/macrogenics-and-lilly-ponder-future-of-diabetes-mab-after-phase-iii-flop/81244098/ |title=MacroGenics and Lilly Ponder Future of Diabetes mAb after Phase III Flop |date=21 Oct 2010 }}</ref>
