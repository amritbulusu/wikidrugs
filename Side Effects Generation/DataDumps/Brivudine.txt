'''Brivudine''' (trade names '''Zostex''', '''Mevir''', '''Brivir''', among others) is an [[antiviral drug]] used in the treatment of [[herpes zoster]] ("shingles").  Like other antivirals, it acts by inhibiting [[Viral replication|replication]] of the target virus.

==Medical uses==
Brivudine is used for the treatment of herpes zoster in adult patients. It is taken orally once daily, in contrast to [[aciclovir]], [[valaciclovir]] and other antivirals.<ref name="Austria-Codex" /> A study has found that it is more effective than [[aciclovir]], but this has been disputed because of a possible [[conflict of interest]] on part of the study authors.<ref name="at" />

==Contraindications==
The drug is contraindicated in patients undergoing [[immunosuppression]] (for example because of an [[organ transplant]]) or cancer therapy, especially with [[fluorouracil]] (5-FU) and chemically related [[prodrug|(pro)drugs]] such as [[capecitabine]] and [[tegafur]], as well as the [[antimycotic]] drug [[flucytosine]], which is also related to 5-FU. It has not been proven to be safe in children and pregnant or breastfeeding women.<ref name="Austria-Codex" />

==Adverse effects==
The drug is generally well tolerated. The only common side effect is [[nausea]] (in 2% of patients). Less common side effects (<1%) include headache, increased or lowered blood cell counts ([[granulocytopenia]], [[anaemia]], [[lymphocytosis]], [[monocytosis]]), increased liver enzymes, and allergic reactions.<ref name="Austria-Codex" />

==Interactions==
Brivudine interacts strongly and in rare cases lethally with the anticancer drug [[fluorouracil]] (5-FU), its prodrugs and related substances. Even [[Topical medication|topically]] applied 5-FU can be dangerous in combination with brivudine. This is caused by the main [[metabolite]], bromovinyluracil (BVU), irreversibly inhibiting the enzyme [[dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase]] (DPD) which is necessary for inactivating 5-FU. After a standard brivudine therapy, DPD function can be compromised for up to 18 days. This interaction is shared with the closely related drug [[sorivudine]] which also has BVU as its main metabolite.<ref name="Austria-Codex" /><ref name="DÄB" />

There are no other relevant interactions. Brivudine does not significantly influence the [[cytochrome P450]] enzymes in the liver.<ref name="Austria-Codex" />

==Pharmacology==

===Spectrum of activity===
The drug inhibits [[viral replication|replication]] of [[varicella zoster virus]] (VZV) – which causes herpes zoster – and [[herpes simplex virus]] type 1 (HSV-1), but not HSV-2 which typically causes genital herpes. ''[[In vitro]]'', [[half maximal inhibitory concentration|inhibitory concentration]]s against VZV are 200- to 1000-fold lower than those of aciclovir and [[penciclovir]], theoretically indicating a much higher potency of brivudine. Clinically relevant VZV strains are particularly sensitive.<ref name="Steinhilber" />

===Mechanism of action===
Brivudine is an analogue of the [[nucleoside]] [[thymidine]]. The active compound is brivudine 5'-triphosphate, which is formed in subsequent [[phosphorylation]]s by viral (but not human) [[thymidine kinase]] and presumably by [[nucleoside-diphosphate kinase]]. Brivudine 5'-triphosphate works because it is incorporated into the viral DNA, but then blocks the action of [[DNA polymerases]], thus inhibiting viral replication.<ref name="Austria-Codex" /><ref name="Steinhilber" />

===Pharmacokinetics===
Brivudine is well and rapidly absorbed from the gut and undergoes [[first-pass metabolism]] in the liver, where the enzyme [[thymidine phosphorylase]]<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0006-2952(83)90307-6|pmid=6651877|title=Phosphorolysis of (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (BVDU) and other 5-substituted-2'-deoxyuridines by purified human thymidine phosphorylase and intact blood platelets|journal=Biochemical Pharmacology|volume=32|issue=23|pages=3583|year=1983|last1=Desgranges|first1=C.|last2=Razaka|first2=G.|last3=Rabaud|first3=M.|last4=Bricaud|first4=H.|last5=Balzarini|first5=J.|last6=De Clercq|first6=E.}}</ref> quickly splits off the sugar component, leading to a [[bioavailability]] of 30%. The resulting metabolite is bromovinyluracil (BVU), which does not have antiviral activity. BVU is also the only metabolite that can be detected in the blood plasma.<ref name="Austria-Codex" /><ref name="Mutschler" />

Highest blood plasma concentrations are reached after one hour. Brivudine is almost completely (>95%) [[Plasma protein binding|bound to plasma proteins]]. [[Terminal half-life]] is 16 hours; 65% of the substance are found in the urine and 20% in the faeces, mainly in form of an [[acetic acid]] derivative (which is not detectable in the plasma), but also other water-soluble metabolites, which are [[urea]] derivatives. Less than 1% is excreted in form of the original compound.<ref name="Austria-Codex" />

</gallery>

==Chemistry==
The molecule has three [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] carbon atoms in the [[deoxyribose]] (sugar) part all of which have defined orientation; i.e. the drug is [[stereochemical]]ly pure.<ref name="Austria-Codex" /> The substance is a white powder.

==Manufacturing==
Main supplier is Berlin-Chemie, now part of Italy's [[Menarini]] Group. In Central America is provided by Menarini Centro America and Wyeth.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==History==
The substance was first synthesized by scientists at the [[University of Birmingham]] in the UK in 1976. It was shown to be a potent inhibitor of HSV-1 and VZV by [[Erik De Clercq]] at the [[Rega Institute for Medical Research]] in [[Belgium]] in 1979. In the 1980s the drug became commercially available in [[East Germany]], where it was marketed as ''Helpin'' by a pharmaceutical company called Berlin-Chemie. Only after the indication was changed to the treatment of herpes zoster in 2001 did it become more widely available in Europe.<ref name="DeClerq" /><ref name="bioactive" />

Brivudine is approved for use in a number of European countries including Austria, Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland.<ref name="International">{{drugs.com|international|brivudine}}: Brivudine.</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''brivudine'' derives from the chemical nomenclature ''[[bromine|bromo]]-[[vinyl group|vinyl]]-[[deoxyuridine]]'' or BVDU for short. It is sold under trade names such as Bridic, Brival, Brivex, Brivir, Brivirac, Brivox, Brivuzost, Zerpex, Zonavir, Zostex, and Zovudex.<ref name="International" />

==Research==
A [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane Systematic Review]] examined the effectiveness of multiple antiviral drugs in the treatment of [[herpes of the eye|herpes simplex virus epithelial keratitis]]. Brivudine was found to be significantly more effective than [[idoxuridine]] in increasing the number of successfully healed eyes of participants.<ref name="Wilhelmus2015" />
