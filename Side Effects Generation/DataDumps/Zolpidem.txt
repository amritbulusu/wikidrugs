<!-- Adverse effects -->
In 2013, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] required manufacturers to decrease the recommended dose for women by half, after studies showed that the medicines can leave people drowsy in the morning and at risk for [[motor vehicle collision]]s.

Zolpidem has some muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant properties, but has not been approved for use in muscle relaxation or seizure prevention.

===Tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal===
[[File:Stilnoct2.JPG|thumb|Ambien tablets]]
A review medical publication found long-term use of zolpidem is associated with [[drug tolerance]], [[substance dependence]], [[rebound insomnia]], and [[central nervous system|CNS]]-related adverse effects. It was recommended that zolpidem be used for short periods of time using the lowest effective dose. Zolpidem 10&nbsp;mg is effective in treating insomnia when used intermittently no fewer than three and no more than five pills per week for a period of 12 weeks.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Perlis ML, McCall WV, Krystal AD, Walsh JK | title = Long-term, non-nightly administration of zolpidem in the treatment of patients with primary insomnia | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 65 | issue = 8 | pages = 1128–1137 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15323600 | doi = 10.4088/jcp.v65n0816 }}</ref> The 15-mg zolpidem dosage provided no clinical advantage over the 10-mg zolpidem dosage.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Scharf MB, Roth T, Vogel GW, Walsh JK | title = A multicenter, placebo-controlled study evaluating zolpidem in the treatment of chronic insomnia | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 55 | issue = 5 | pages = 192–199 | year = 1994 | pmid = 8071269 }}</ref>

Nonpharmacological treatment options (e.g. [[cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia]]), however, were found to have sustained improvements in sleep quality.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kirkwood CK | title = Management of insomnia | journal = J Am Pharm Assoc (Wash) | volume = 39 | issue = 5 | pages = 688–96; quiz 713–4 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10533351 | doi =  | url =  }}</ref> Animal studies of the [[drug tolerance|tolerance]]-inducing properties have shown that in rodents, zolpidem has less tolerance-producing potential than [[benzodiazepines]], but in primates the tolerance-producing potential of zolpidem was the same as that of benzodiazepines.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Petroski RE, Pomeroy JE, Das R, Bowman H, Yang W, Chen AP, Foster AC | title = Indiplon is a high-affinity positive allosteric modulator with selectivity for alpha1 subunit-containing GABAA receptors | journal = J.

Tolerance  to the effects of zolpidem can develop in some people in just a few weeks. Abrupt withdrawal may cause [[delirium]], seizures, or other severe effects, especially if used for prolonged periods and at high dosages.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Harter C, Piffl-Boniolo E, Rave-Schwank M | title = [Development of drug withdrawal delirium after dependence on zolpidem and zoplicone] | language = German | journal = Psychiatr Prax | volume = 26 | issue = 6 | page = 309 | date = November 1999 | pmid = 10627964 | doi =  | url =  | trans_title = Development of drug withdrawal delirium after dependence on zolpidem and zoplicone }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = Hypnotic dependence: zolpidem and zopiclone too | journal = Prescrire Int | volume = 10 | issue = 51 | page = 15 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11503851 | doi =  | url =  }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sethi PK, Khandelwal DC | title = Zolpidem at supratherapeutic doses can cause drug abuse, dependence and withdrawal seizure | journal = J Assoc Physicians India | volume = 53 | issue =  | pages = 139–40 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15847035 | doi =  | url = http://www.japi.org/february2005/CR-139.pdf | format = PDF }}</ref>

When drug tolerance and physical dependence to zolpidem has developed, treatment usually entails a gradual dose reduction over a period of months to minimise withdrawal symptoms, which can resemble those seen during [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome|benzodiazepine withdrawal]]. Failing that, an alternative method may be necessary for some patients, such as a switch to a [[benzodiazepine equivalent]] dose of a longer-acting benzodiazepine drug, such as [[diazepam]] or [[chlordiazepoxide]], followed by a gradual reduction in dosage of the long-acting [[benzodiazepine]]. Sometimes for difficult-to-treat patients, an inpatient [[flumazenil]] rapid detoxification program can be used to detoxify from a zolpidem [[drug dependence]] or [[Substance use disorder|addiction]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Quaglio G, Lugoboni F, Fornasiero A, Lechi A, Gerra G, Mezzelani P | title = Dependence on zolpidem: two case reports of detoxification with flumazenil infusion | journal = Int Clin Psychopharmacol | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 285–7 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16096519 | doi = 10.1097/01.yic.0000166404.41850.b4 }}</ref>

Alcohol has [[cross tolerance]] with GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor positive modulators such as the [[benzodiazepines]] and the [[nonbenzodiazepine]] drugs. For this reason, alcoholics or recovering alcoholics may be at increased risk of [[physical dependency]] on zolpidem. Also, alcoholics and drug abusers may be at increased risk of abusing and or becoming psychologically dependent on zolpidem. It should be avoided in those with a history of [[alcoholism]], [[drug misuse]], [[physical dependency]], or [[Substance dependence|psychological dependency]] on sedative-hypnotic drugs. Zolpidem has rarely been associated with [[drug-seeking behavior]],{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} the risk of which is amplified in patients with a history of drug or alcohol abuse.

===Overdose===
An overdose of zolpidem may cause excessive sedation, pin-point pupils, or depressed respiratory function, which may progress to coma, and possibly death. Combined with alcohol, opiates, or other [[Central nervous system|CNS]] depressants, it may be even more likely to lead to fatal overdoses. Zolpidem overdosage can be treated with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist [[flumazenil]], which displaces zolpidem from its binding site on the benzodiazepine receptor to rapidly reverse the effects of the zolpidem.<ref name="pmid2111156">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lheureux P, Debailleul G, De Witte O, Askenasi R | title = Zolpidem intoxication mimicking narcotic overdose: response to flumazenil | journal = Human & Experimental Toxicology | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 105–7 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2111156 | doi = 10.1177/096032719000900209 }}</ref>

===Detection in body fluids===
Zolpidem may be quantitated in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients, provide evidence in an impaired driving arrest, or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma zolpidem concentrations are usually in a range of 30–300&nbsp;μg/l in persons receiving the drug therapeutically, 100–700&nbsp;μg/l in those arrested for impaired driving, and 1000–7000&nbsp;μg/l in victims of acute overdosage.

==Special precautions==

===Driving===
Use of zolpidem may impair driving skills with a resultant increased risk of [[road traffic accidents]]. This adverse effect is not unique to zolpidem but also occurs with other [[hypnotic]] drugs. Caution should be exercised by motor vehicle drivers.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gustavsen I, Bramness JG, Skurtveit S, Engeland A, Neutel I, Mørland J | title = Road traffic accident risk related to prescriptions of the hypnotics zopiclone, zolpidem, flunitrazepam and nitrazepam | journal = Sleep Med. | volume = 9 | issue = 8 | pages = 818–22 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 18226959 | doi = 10.1016/j.sleep.2007.11.011 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1389-9457(07)00424-8 }}</ref> Studies showed that eight hours after a bedtime dose of 10&nbsp;mg, 15% of women and 3% of men would have blood levels that produce impaired driving skills; for an extended-release dose of 12.5&nbsp;mg, the risk increased to 33% and 25%, respectively. As a consequence, the FDA recommended the dose for women be reduced and that prescribers should consider lower doses for men.<ref>{{cite journal | title = FDA Requires Lower Dosing of Zolpidem | journal = [[The Medical Letter on Drugs and Therapeutics]] | volume = 55 | issue = 1408 | page = 5 | publisher = The Medical Letter | date = January 21, 2013 | url = http://secure.medicalletter.org/cannotaccess?ac=1&a=1408a&t=article&n=11758&p=tml&title=FDA%20Requires%20Lower%20Dosing%20of%20Zolpidem&i=1408 | accessdate = April 14, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | title = FDA Drug Safety Communication: Risk of next-morning impairment after use of insomnia drugs; FDA requires lower recommended doses for certain drugs containing zolpidem (Ambien, Ambien CR, Edluar, and Zolpimist) | date = January 10, 2013 | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] | url = http://www.fda.gov/drugs/drugsafety/ucm334033.htm | accessdate = April 14, 2013 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}} }}</ref>

===Elderly===
The elderly are more sensitive to the effects of hypnotics including zolpidem. Zolpidem causes an increased risk of falls and may induce adverse cognitive effects.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Antai-Otong D | title = The art of prescribing. Risks and benefits of non-benzodiazepine receptor agonists in the treatment of acute primary insomnia in older adults | journal = Perspect Psychiatr Care | volume = 42 | issue = 3 | pages = 196–200 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16916422 | doi = 10.1111/j.1744-6163.2006.00070.x | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118727940/abstract }}</ref>

An extensive review of the medical literature regarding the management of insomnia and the elderly found that there is considerable evidence of the effectiveness and durability of nondrug treatments for insomnia in adults of all ages, and  these interventions are underused. Compared with the benzodiazepines, the [[nonbenzodiazepine]] (including zolpidem) sedative-hypnotics appeared to offer few, if any, significant clinical advantages in efficacy or tolerability in elderly persons. Newer agents with novel mechanisms of action and improved safety profiles, such as the [[melatonin receptor agonists]], were found to hold promise for the management of chronic insomnia in elderly people.

Long-term use of sedative-hypnotics for insomnia lacks an evidence base and has traditionally been discouraged for reasons that include concerns about such potential adverse drug effects as cognitive impairment ([[anterograde amnesia]]), daytime sedation, motor incoordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls. In addition, the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of these agents remain to be determined. More research is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of treatment and the most appropriate management strategy for elderly persons with chronic insomnia.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bain KT | title = Management of chronic insomnia in elderly persons | journal = Am J Geriatr Pharmacother | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 168–92 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16860264 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjopharm.2006.06.006 }}</ref>

=== Gastroesophageal reflux disease ===
Patients suffering from [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] (GERD) had reflux events measured to be significantly longer when taking zolpidem than on placebo. The same trend was found for reflux events in patients without GERD.

===Pregnancy===
Zolpidem has been assigned to [[pregnancy category]] C by the FDA. Animal studies have revealed evidence of incomplete ossification and increased postimplantation fetal loss at doses greater than seven times the maximum recommended human dose or higher; however, teratogenicity was not observed at any dose level. There are no controlled data in human pregnancy. In one case report, zolpidem was found in cord blood at delivery. Zolpidem is recommended for use during pregnancy only when benefits outweigh risks.

==Mechanism of action==
[[Image:Zolpidem DOJ.jpg|frame|right]]
Zolpidem is a high-affinity [[allosteric modulator|positive modulator]] of [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors]]. It selectively binds to [[Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit alpha-1|α<sub>1</sub>]] [[Protein subunit|subunits]] of this [[pentameric protein|pentameric]] [[Ligand-gated ion channel|ion channel]]. Accordingly, it has strong [[hypnotic]] properties and weak [[anxiolytic]], [[myorelaxant]], and [[anticonvulsant]] properties.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Salvà P, Costa J | title = Clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of zolpidem.

==Chemistry==
Three syntheses of zolpidem are common. 4-methylacetophenone is used as a common precursor. This is brominated and reacted with 2-amino-5-methylpyridine to give the imidazopyridine. From here the reactions use a variety of reagents to complete the synthesis, either involving [[thionyl chloride]] or [[sodium cyanide]]. These reagents are challenging to handle and require thorough safety assessments.<ref name=JohnsonDS>{{cite book |vauthors=Johnson DS, Li JJ | title = The art of drug synthesis | year = 2007 | publisher = Wiley-Interscience | location = Hoboken, N.J. | isbn = 9780471752158 | pages = Chapter 15, Section 2 }}</ref><ref name="prep">{{Cite patent | inventor-last = Rawalnath | inventor-first = Sakhardande Rajiv | inventor2-last = Crasta Santosh | inventor2-first = Richard | inventor3-last = SAXENA | inventor3-first = ALOK | publication-date = 21 Dec 2005 | title = Process for the preparation of zolpidem | issue-date = 14-Feb-2011 | country-code = IN | patent-number = 246080 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

===Drug–drug interactions===
Notable drug–drug interactions with the pharmacokinetics of zolpidem include [[chlorpromazine]], [[fluconazole]], [[imipramine]], [[itraconazole]], [[ketoconazole]], [[rifampicin]], and [[ritonavir]]. Interactions with [[carbamazepine]] and [[phenytoin]] can be expected based on their metabolic pathways, but have not yet been studied. There does not appear to be any interaction between zolpidem and [[cimetidine]] or [[ranitidine]].<ref name="pmid3253224|noedit">{{cite journal | author = Hulhoven R, Desager JP, Harvengt C, Hermann P, Guillet P, Thiercelin JF | title = Lack of interaction between zolpidem and H2 antagonists, cimetidine and ranitidine | journal = International journal of clinical pharmacology research | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = 471–476 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3253224 | last2 = Desager | last3 = Harvengt | last4 = Hermann | last5 = Guillet | last6 = Thiercelin }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Wang JS, DeVane CL | title = Pharmacokinetics and drug interactions of the sedative hypnotics | journal = Psychopharmacol Bull | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 10–29 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14561946 | doi = 10.1007/BF01990373 | url = http://www.medworksmedia.com/psychopharmbulletin/pdf/12/010-029_PB%20W03_Wang_final.pdf | format = PDF | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070709230745/http://www.medworksmedia.com/psychopharmbulletin/pdf/12/010-029_PB%20W03_Wang_final.pdf | archivedate = 2007-07-09 | last2 = Devane }}</ref> However, it was noted in the same study that [[cimetidine]] did appear to prolong the hypnotic effects of Zolpidem beyond its typical 3 hour duration, which is indicative of some sort of metabolic interaction.<ref name="pmid3253224|noedit"/>

==Usage==
Zolpidem is one of the most common [[GABA]]-potentiating sleeping medications prescribed in the [[Netherlands]], with a total of 582,660 prescriptions dispensed in 2008.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gipdatabank.nl/ | title = Home &#124; GIPdatabank | publisher = Gipdatabank.nl | date = 2013-11-15 | accessdate = 2014-01-31}}</ref>

The [[United States Air Force]] uses zolpidem as one of the hypnotics approved as a "[[no-go pill]]"  (with a 6-hour restriction on subsequent flight operation) to help aviators and special duty personnel sleep in support of mission readiness. (The other hypnotics used are [[temazepam]] and [[zaleplon]].) "Ground tests" are required prior to authorization issued to use the medication in an operational situation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/afsoc/publication/afsoci48-101/afsoci48-101.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 8, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611124025/http://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/afsoc/publication/afsoci48-101/afsoci48-101.pdf |archivedate=June 11, 2014 }}</ref>

==Society and culture==

===Abuse===
Zolpidem has a potential for either medical misuse when the drug is continued long term without or against medical advice or recreational use when the drug is taken to achieve a "high".<ref>{{cite journal | author = Griffiths RR, Johnson MW | title = Relative abuse liability of hypnotic drugs: a conceptual framework and algorithm for differentiating among compounds | journal = J Clin Psychiatry | volume = 66 Suppl 9 | issue =  | pages = 31–41 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16336040 | doi =  | url =  | last2 = Johnson }}</ref> The transition from medical use of zolpidem to high-dose addiction or [[drug dependence]] can occur when used without a doctor's recommendation to continue using it, when physiological [[drug tolerance]] leads to higher doses than the usual 5&nbsp;mg or 10&nbsp;mg, when consumed through inhalation or injection, or when taken for purposes other than as a sleep aid. Misuse is more prevalent in those having been dependent on other drugs in the past, but tolerance and [[drug dependence]] can still sometimes occur in those without a history of drug dependence. Chronic users of high doses are more likely to develop [[physical dependence]] on the drug, which may cause severe withdrawal symptoms, including seizures, if abrupt withdrawal from zolpidem occurs.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Barrero-Hernández FJ, Ruiz-Veguilla M, López-López MI, Casado-Torres A | title = [Epileptic seizures as a sign of abstinence from chronic consumption of zolpidem] | language = Spanish| journal = Rev Neurol | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 253–6 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12022074 | doi =  | url =  | trans_title = Epileptic seizures as a sign of abstinence from chronic consumption of zolpidem | last2 = Ruiz-Veguilla | last3 = López-López | last4 = Casado-Torres }}</ref>

One case history reported a woman detoxifying from a high dose of zolpidem experiencing a generalized seizure, with clinical withdrawal and dependence effects reported to be similar to the [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]].<ref name="pmid16950552">{{cite journal | author = Cubała WJ, Landowski J | title = Seizure following sudden zolpidem withdrawal | journal = Prog.

Other drugs, including the benzodiazepines and [[zopiclone]], are also found in high numbers of suspected drugged drivers. Many drivers have blood levels far exceeding the therapeutic dose range suggesting a high degree of excessive-use potential for [[benzodiazepines]], zolpidem and zopiclone.<ref name="pmid17417081">{{cite journal | author = Jones AW, Holmgren A, Kugelberg FC | title = Concentrations of scheduled prescription drugs in blood of impaired drivers: considerations for interpreting the results | journal = Therapeutic drug monitoring | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 248–60 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17417081 | doi = 10.1097/FTD.0b013e31803d3c04 | last2 = Holmgren | last3 = Kugelberg }}</ref>  U.S. Congressman [[Patrick J.

===Regulation===

Based on its potential for abuse and dependence, zolpidem (along with the other benzodiazepine-like [[Z-drug]]s) is a Schedule IV substance under the [[Controlled Substances Act]] in the U.S.
