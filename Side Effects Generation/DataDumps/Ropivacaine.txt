'''Ropivacaine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|rINN]]) {{IPAc-en|r|oʊ|ˈ|p|ɪ|v|ə|k|eɪ|n}} is a [[local anaesthetic]] drug belonging to the [[amino]] [[amide]] group. The name ropivacaine refers to both the [[racemate]] and the marketed ''S''-[[enantiomer]]. '''Ropivacaine hydrochloride''' is commonly marketed by [[AstraZeneca]] under the [[trade name]] '''Naropin'''.

==History==
Ropivacaine was developed after [[bupivacaine]] was noted to be associated with [[cardiac arrest]], particularly in pregnant women. Ropivacaine was found to have less cardiotoxicity than bupivacaine in animal models.

==Clinical use==

===Contraindications===
Ropivacaine is contraindicated for [[intravenous regional anaesthesia]] (IVRA). However, new data suggested both ropivacaine (1.2-1.8&nbsp;mg/kg in 40ml) and levobupivacaine (40 ml of 0.125% solution) be used, because they have less cardiovascular and central nervous system toxicity than racemic bupivacaine.<ref>(Basic of Anesthesia, Robert Stoelting, page 289)</ref>

===Adverse effects===
[[Adverse drug reaction]]s (ADRs) are rare when it is administered correctly. Most ADRs relate to administration technique (resulting in systemic exposure) or pharmacological effects of anesthesia, however [[allergy|allergic]] reactions can rarely occur.

Systemic exposure to excessive quantities of ropivacaine mainly result in [[central nervous system]] (CNS) and [[cardiovascular]] effects – CNS effects usually occur at lower [[blood plasma]] concentrations and additional cardiovascular effects present at higher concentrations, though cardiovascular collapse may also occur with low concentrations. CNS effects may include CNS excitation (nervousness, tingling around the mouth, [[tinnitus]], tremor, dizziness, blurred vision, [[seizure]]s followed by depression (drowsiness, loss of consciousness), [[respiratory depression]] and [[apnea]]). Cardiovascular effects include [[hypotension]], [[bradycardia]], [[arrhythmia]]s, and/or [[cardiac arrest]] – some of which may be due to [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxemia]] secondary to respiratory depression.<ref name="AMH2006">Rossi S, editor. [[Australian Medicines Handbook]] 2006. Adelaide: Australian Medicines Handbook; 2006. {{ISBN|0-9757919-2-3}}</ref>

===Treatment of overdose===
As for [[bupivacaine]], [[Intralipid|Celepid]], a commonly available intravenous lipid emulsion, can be effective in treating severe cardiotoxicity secondary to local anaesthetic overdose in animal experiments<ref name="Weinberg2003">{{cite journal | last1 = Weinberg | first1 = G | last2 = Ripper | first2 = R | last3 = Feinstein | first3 = DL | last4 = Hoffman | first4 = W | year = 2003 | title = Lipid emulsion infusion rescues dogs from bupivacaine-induced cardiac toxicity | url = | journal = Reg Anesth Pain Med | volume = 28 | issue = 3| pages = 198–202 | doi = 10.1053/rapm.2003.50041 | pmid = 12772136 }}</ref> and in humans in a process called [[Lipid rescue#Management|lipid rescue]].<ref name="Picard2006">{{cite journal | last1 = Picard | first1 = J | last2 = Meek | first2 = T | year = 2006 | title = Lipid emulsion to treat overdose of local anaesthetic: the gift of the glob | url = | journal = Anaesthesia | volume = 61 | issue = 2| pages = 107–9 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2044.2005.04494.x | pmid = 16430560 }}</ref><ref name="Rosenblatt2006">{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenblatt | first1 = MA | last2 = Abel | first2 = M | last3 = Fischer | first3 = GW | last4 = Itzkovich | first4 = CJ | last5 = Eisenkraft | first5 = JB | year = 2006 | title = Successful Use of a 20% lipid emulsion to resuscitate a patient after a presumed bupivacaine-related cardiac arrest | url = | journal = Anesthesiology | volume = 105 | issue = 1| pages = 217–8 | doi = 10.1097/00000542-200607000-00033 | pmid = 16810015 }}</ref><ref name="Litz2006">{{cite journal | last1 = Litz | first1 = RJ | last2 = Popp | first2 = M | last3 = Stehr | first3 = S N | last4 = Koch | first4 = T | year = 2006 | title = Successful resuscitation of a patient with ropivacaine-induced asystole after axillary plexus block using lipid infusion | url = | journal = Anaesthesia | volume = 61 | issue = | pages = 800–1 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2044.2006.04740.x | pmid=16867094}}</ref>
