'''Piracetam''' (sold under many brand names) is a medication in the [[racetam]]s group, with chemical name ''2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetamide''. It is used in Europe, Asia and South America.{{cn|date=July 2016}} In the United States, it is not approved by the [[US Food and Drug Administration]] for any medical use and it is not permitted to be sold as a [[dietary supplement]].<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/ucm225605.htm Inspections, Compliance, Enforcement, and Criminal Investigations]</ref><ref>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/enforcement/enforce_rpt-Product-Tabs.cfm?action=select&recall_number=D-194-2013&w=03202013&lang=eng Enforcement Report - Week of 20 March 2013]</ref>  In the UK, piracetam is prescribed mainly for [[myoclonus]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/medicines/100001864.html |title=Nootropil |publisher=NetDoctor.co.uk |date=8 July 2004 |accessdate=21 September 2009}}</ref> but is [[Off-label use|used off-label]] for other conditions. Evidence to support its use for many conditions is unclear.

It shares the same 2-oxo-pyrrolidone base structure with [[pyroglutamic acid]]. Piracetam is a cyclic derivative of [[GABA]] (gamma-Aminobutyric acid).

==Medical uses==

==Mechanisms of action==
Piracetam's [[mechanism of action]], as with [[racetam]]s in general, is not fully understood. The drug influences neuronal and vascular functions and influences cognitive function without acting as a sedative or stimulant.<ref name=Winblad2005/> Piracetam is a [[positive allosteric modulator]] of the [[AMPA receptor]], although this action is very weak and its clinical effects may not necessarily be mediated by this action.<ref name=ahmedoswald>{{Cite journal| doi=10.1021/jm901905j| year=2010 |last1=Ahmed |first1=A |last2=Oswald| first2=R |title=Piracetam Defines a New Binding Site for Allosteric Modulators of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors |journal=Journal of Medicinal Chemistry |volume=53| issue=5 | pages=2197–2203| pmid=20163115| pmc=2872987}}</ref> It is hypothesized to act on ion channels or ion carriers, thus leading to increased neuron excitability.<ref name=noot>{{Cite journal|pmid=8061686 |year=1994 |last1=Gouliaev |first1=AH |last2=Senning |title=Piracetam and other structurally related nootropics |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=180–222 |journal=Brain research.

It has been found to increase blood flow and oxygen consumption in parts of the brain, but this may be a side effect of increased brain activity rather than a primary effect or mechanism of action for the drug.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=8876930 |year=1996 |last1=Jordaan |first1=B |last2=Oliver |last3=Dormehl |last4=Hugo |title=Cerebral blood flow effects of piracetam, pentifylline, and nicotinic acid in the baboon model compared with the known effect of acetazolamide |volume=46 |issue=9 |pages=844–7 |journal=Arzneimittel-Forschung |first2=DW |first3=IC |first4=N}}</ref>
