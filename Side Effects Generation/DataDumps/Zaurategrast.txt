'''Zaurategrast''' ('''CDP323''') is a small-molecule [[prodrug]] [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of the [[VCAM-1|vascular cell adhesion molecule 1]] (VCAM-1) binding to α4-[[integrin]]s. It was originally developed by the [[United Kingdom|British]] biopharmaceutical company [[Celltech]] plc. (now [[UCB (company)|UCB S.A.]]) and was a [[Investigational New Drug|putative]] new drug for [[mouth|oral]] treatment of [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 17631252| year = 2007| author1 = Davenport| first1 = R. J.| title = Alpha4-integrin antagonism--an effective approach for the treatment of inflammatory diseases?| journal = Drug Discovery Today| volume = 12| issue = 13–14| pages = 569–76| last2 = Munday| first2 = J. R.| doi = 10.1016/j.drudis.2007.05.001}}</ref>

In October 2006, UCB and [[Biogen Idec]] announced a collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize zaurategrast for the treatment of [[multiple sclerosis]] and other potential [[Indication (medicine)|indications]].<ref>[http://hugin.info/133973/R/1079005/186265.pdf Press Release UCB S.A.] 2-Oct-2006; accessed 11-Sep-2007</ref> In June 2009, development of zaurategrast was discontinued due to discouraging results of a Phase II [[clinical trial]].<ref name=discontinuation>[http://www.ucb.com/media-room/newsdetail/?det=1326231 ''UCB: discontinuation of research concerning CDP323''.]</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==
The [[mechanism of action]] of zaurategrast were believed to rely on preventing [[immune cell]]s to migrate from [[blood vessel]]s through the vessel walls to reach various [[inflammation|inflamed]] [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]s, including the [[brain]]. This mechanism is thought to prevent overshooting immune reactions and subsequent tissue damage as seen during uncontrolled immune cell migration as in multiple sclerosis. Zaurategrast has the same mechanism of action as the [[monoclonal antibody]] [[natalizumab]].

== Results in animal models ==
Zaurategrast  was investigated in chronic [[experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis]] (EAE) in [[mouse|mice]]. The drug was effective when given [[Prophylaxis|prophylactically]] (i.e., before the [[disease]] was induced in mice) and when given [[Therapy|therapeutically]] (i.e., after outbreak of the disease) and reduced the disease severity significantly.<ref>[http://registration.akm.ch/einsicht.php?XNABSTRACT_ID=13753&XNSPRACHE_ID=2&XNKONGRESS_ID=22&XNMASKEN_ID=900 Watt G, Gauden V, McNeil K et al. ''Effect of CDP323, a small molecule VLA-4 antagonist, on chronic experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in C57Bl/6 mice''.] ECTRIMS 2005; accessed 11-Sep-2007</ref>

== Clinical development ==
The safety, [[tolerability]], and [[pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]] profile of zaurategrast have been evaluated in 75 female and male healthy volunteers in three separate Phase 1 studies. Zaurategrast was well tolerated at oral doses up to 1000&nbsp;mg given twice daily for 7 [[consecutive]] days with an [[adverse event]] profile comparable to that observed with [[placebo]]. There was no gender effect. The oral administration resulted in [[Reaction inhibitor|inhibition]] of VCAM-1 binding which could be maintained throughout a 12&#8209; or 24&#8209;hour dose interval at well tolerated doses<ref>[http://registration.akm.ch/einsicht.php?XNABSTRACT_ID=31558&XNSPRACHE_ID=2&XNKONGRESS_ID=39&XNMASKEN_ID=900 Baker M, Shock A, Parton T et al. ''Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the VLA-4 inhibitor CDP323''.] ECTRIMS 2006; accessed 11-Sep-2007</ref>

A Phase 2 study commenced in June 2007 in [[Europe]] and in the [[United States|US]]. The study intends to enroll over 200 patients with relapsing MS who have failed earlier treatment with an [[interferon-beta]] and will compare two doses of the drug to placebo over a period of six months. The results are expected by the end of 2008.,<ref>[http://hugin.info/133973/R/1135424/212873.pdf Press Release UCB S.A.] 26-Jun-2007; accessed 11-Sep-2007</ref><ref>[http://www.clinicaltrial.gov/ct/show/NCT00484536?order=1 Clinicaltrial.gov Entry]; accessed 11-Sep-2007</ref>  Preliminary interim efficacy analysis showed that patients enrolled in this clinical trial did not benefit as expected from zaurategrast compared to placebo after a six month treatment period. No cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy were noted.<ref name=discontinuation/>
