==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
Epristeride is unique in its [[mechanism of action]] relative to finasteride and dutasteride in that it binds irreversibly to 5α-reductase and results in the formation of an unproductive complex of the 5α-reductase enzyme, the [[substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] [[testosterone]], and the [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] [[NADPH]].<ref name="Publishers1996" /><ref name="Bradbury2007">{{cite book|author=Rob Bradbury|title=Cancer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fdtDAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA49|date=30 January 2007|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-33120-9|pages=49–}}</ref> For this reason, testosterone is caught in a trap, and it was initially speculated that the reciprocal increase in intraprostatic levels of testosterone seen with finasteride and dutasteride should not happen with epristeride.<ref name="Publishers1996" /><ref name="Bradbury2007" /> However, subsequent clinical data have not supported this hypothesis.<ref name="Publishers1996" /> Moreover, in spite of the fact that epristeride is a very potent inhibitor of 5α-reductase type II (0.18–2&nbsp;nM), it has been found to reduce circulating levels of [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT) by only 25 to 54% following 8 days of therapy over a dosage range of 0.4 to 160&nbsp;mg/day.<ref name="Publishers1996" /> For this reason, relative to other 5α-reductase inhibitors like finasteride and dutasteride, the degree of DHT suppression with epristeride falls short of that desirable for full clinical benefit.<ref name="Publishers1996" />

==History==
Epristeride was under development for the treatment of BPH, [[androgenic alopecia]] (pattern hair loss), and [[acne vulgaris]] by [[SmithKline Beecham]] (now [[GlaxoSmithKline]]) in the 1990s and reached [[Clinical trial#Phase III|phase III]] [[clinical trial]]s in the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[Japan]],<ref name="pmid18465521"/> but ultimately was never marketed in these countries and was developed and introduced for the treatment of BPH by [[Ono Pharmaceutical]] in China instead.<ref name="AdisInsight" />
