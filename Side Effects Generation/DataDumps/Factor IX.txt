'''Factor IX''' (or '''Christmas factor''') ({{EC number|3.4.21.22}}) is one of the [[serine protease]]s of the [[coagulation]] system; it belongs to peptidase family S1. Deficiency of this protein causes [[Haemophilia B|hemophilia B]]. It was discovered in 1952 after a young boy named [[Stephen Christmas]] was found to be lacking this exact factor, leading to [[hemophilia]].<ref name="PMD12997790">{{cite journal | vauthors = Biggs R, Douglas AS, Macfarlane RG, Dacie JV, Pitney WR | title = Christmas disease: a condition previously mistaken for haemophilia | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 2 | issue = 4799 | pages = 1378–82 | date = Dec 1952 | pmid = 12997790 | pmc = 2022306 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.2.4799.1378 }}</ref>

[[File:Coagulation full.svg|thumb|The blood coagulation and [[Protein C]] pathway.|left]]

Factor IX is produced as a [[zymogen]], an inactive precursor.  It is processed to remove the [[signal peptide]], [[Glycosylation|glycosylated]] and then cleaved by [[factor XI]]a (of the contact pathway) or [[factor VII]]a (of the tissue factor pathway) to produce a two-chain form where the chains are linked by a [[disulfide bridge]].<ref name="pmid659613">{{cite journal | vauthors = Di Scipio RG, Kurachi K, Davie EW | title = Activation of human factor IX (Christmas factor) | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 61 | issue = 6 | pages = 1528–38 | date = Jun 1978 | pmid = 659613 | pmc = 372679 | doi = 10.1172/JCI109073 }}</ref><ref name="pmid9331959">{{cite journal | vauthors = Taran LD | title = Factor IX of the blood coagulation system: a review | journal = Biochemistry.

Factor IX is inhibited by [[antithrombin]].<ref name="pmid659613" />

Factor IX expression increases with age in humans and mice. In mouse models mutations within the promoter region of factor IX have an age-dependent phenotype.<ref name="pmid7662969">{{cite journal | vauthors = Boland EJ, Liu YC, Walter CA, Herbert DC, Weaker FJ, Odom MW, Jagadeeswaran P | title = Age-specific regulation of clotting factor IX gene expression in normal and transgenic mice | journal = Blood | volume = 86 | issue = 6 | pages = 2198–205 | date = Sep 1995 | pmid = 7662969 }}</ref>

== Domain architecture ==

[[Factor VII|Factors VII]], IX, and [[Factor X|X]] all play key roles in [[blood coagulation]] and also share a common domain architecture.<ref name="pmid11723140">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhong D, Bajaj MS, Schmidt AE, Bajaj SP | title = The N-terminal epidermal growth factor-like domain in factor IX and factor X represents an important recognition motif for binding to tissue factor | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 277 | issue = 5 | pages = 3622–31 | date = Feb 2002 | pmid = 11723140 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M111202200 }}</ref> The factor IX protein is composed of four [[protein domain]]s: the [[Gla domain]], two tandem copies of the [[EGF-like domain|EGF domain]] and a C-terminal [[trypsin]]-like peptidase domain which carries out the catalytic cleavage.

The N-terminal EGF domain has been shown to at least in part be responsible for binding [[tissue factor]].<ref name="pmid11723140"/> Wilkinson ''et al''. conclude that residues 88 to 109 of the second EGF domain mediate binding to platelets and assembly of the factor X activating complex.<ref name="pmid11714704">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilkinson FH, Ahmad SS, Walsh PN | title = The factor IXa second epidermal growth factor (EGF2) domain mediates platelet binding and assembly of the factor X activating complex | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 277 | issue = 8 | pages = 5734–41 | date = Feb 2002 | pmid = 11714704 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M107753200 }}</ref>

The structures of all four domains have been solved.

== Genetics ==
[[File:F9 gene location.png|thumb|In human, the F9 gene is located on the [[X chromosome]] at position q27.1.]]
The [[gene]] for factor IX is located on the [[X chromosome]] (Xq27.1-q27.2) and is therefore [[X-linked recessive]]: mutations in this gene affect males much more frequently than females. It was first cloned in 1982 by Kotoku Kurachi and [[Earl Davie]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurachi K, Davie EW | title = Isolation and characterization of a cDNA coding for human factor IX | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 79 | issue = 21 | pages = 6461–4 | date = Nov 1982 | pmid = 6959130 | pmc = 347146 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.79.21.6461 }}</ref>

[[Polly and Molly|Polly]], a transgenic cloned [[Poll Dorset]] sheep carrying the gene for factor IX, was produced by Dr [[Ian Wilmut]] at the [[Roslin Institute]] in 1997.<ref>{{cite book |author=Nicholl D. |title=An Introduction to Genetic Engineering Second Edition | publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=257 |year=2002}}</ref>

== Role in disease ==

Deficiency of factor IX causes Christmas disease ([[hemophilia B]]).<ref name="PMD12997790" /> Over 100 mutations of factor IX have been described; some cause no symptoms, but many lead to a significant bleeding disorder. The original Christmas disease mutation was identified by sequencing of Christmas' DNA, revealing a mutation which changed a cysteine to a serine.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor SA, Duffin J, Cameron C, Teitel J, Garvey B, Lillicrap DP | title = Characterization of the original Christmas disease mutation (cysteine 206----serine): from clinical recognition to molecular pathogenesis | journal = Thrombosis and Haemostasis | volume = 67 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–5 | date = Jan 1992 | pmid = 1615485 }}</ref>
[[Recombinant DNA|Recombinant]] factor IX is used to treat Christmas disease. Formulations include:

Some rare mutations of factor IX result in elevated clotting activity, and can result in clotting diseases, such as [[deep vein thrombosis]].<ref name="pmid19846852">{{cite journal | vauthors = Simioni P, Tormene D, Tognin G, Gavasso S, Bulato C, Iacobelli NP, Finn JD, Spiezia L, Radu C, Arruda VR | title = X-linked thrombophilia with a mutant factor IX (factor IX Padua) | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 361 | issue = 17 | pages = 1671–5 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19846852 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa0904377 }}</ref>

Factor IX deficiency is treated by injection of purified factor IX produced through cloning in various animal or animal cell vectors. [[Tranexamic acid]] may be of value in patients undergoing surgery who have inherited factor IX deficiency in order to reduce the perioperative risk of bleeding.<ref name="pmid21712351">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rossi M, Jayaram R, Sayeed R | title = Do patients with haemophilia undergoing cardiac surgery have good surgical outcomes? | journal = Interactive Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 320–31 | date = Sep 2011 | pmid = 21712351 | doi = 10.1510/icvts.2011.272401 }}</ref>
