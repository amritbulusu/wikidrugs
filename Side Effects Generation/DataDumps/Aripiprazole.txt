===Schizophrenia===
The United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved the oral form of aripiprazole for the treatment of acute exacerbations of schizophrenia and for maintenance treatment (relapse prevention) in 2002. The approval was based on efficacy demonstrated in 5 "adequate and well-controlled" clinical trials, including 4 short-term studies ( 4 or 6 weeks) showing a reduction in psychotic symptoms in the acute setting and 1 longer-term study (26 weeks) demonstrating reduced relapse compared to placebo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/021436s038,021713s030,021729s022,021866s023lbl.pdf |title=FDA prescribing information aripiprazole |accessdate=2015-01-28 }}</ref> Marketing approval was granted by the [[European Medicines Agency]] based on the results of these same studies, plus an additional long-term study demonstrating non-inferiority to haloperidol in the prevention of relapse.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Product_Information/human/000471/WC500020170.pdf |title=European Medicines Agency |accessdate=2015-01-28 }}</ref> Health Canada approved aripiprazole for the acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Product_http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/prodpharma/sbd-smd/drug-med/sbd_smd_2009_abilify_120192-eng.php#a3 |title=Health Canada |accessdate=2015-01-28 }}</ref>

A Lancet review found that it is in the middle range of 15 antipsychotics for effectiveness, approximately as effective as [[haloperidol]] and [[quetiapine]] and slightly more effective than [[ziprasidone]] and [[chlorpromazine]], with better tolerability compared to the other antipsychotic drugs (4th best for weight gain, 5th best for [[extrapyramidal symptoms]], best for prolactin elevation, 2nd best for [[QTc]] prolongation, and 5th best for sedation). The authors concluded that for acute psychotic episodes aripiprazole results in benefits in some aspects of the condition.<ref name = "Lancet2013">{{cite journal | vauthors = Leucht S, Cipriani A, Spineli L, Mavridis D, Orey D, Richter F, Samara M, Barbui C, Engel RR, Geddes JR, Kissling W, Stapf MP, Lässig B, Salanti G, Davis JM | title = Comparative efficacy and tolerability of 15 antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia: a multiple-treatments meta-analysis | journal = Lancet | volume = 382 | issue = 9896 | pages = 951–62 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23810019 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60733-3 }}</ref>

A Cochrane review comparing aripiprazole with placebo concluded that high dropout rates in clinical trials, and a lack of outcome data regarding general functioning, behavior, mortality, economic outcomes, or cognitive functioning make it difficult to definitively conclude that aripiprazole is useful for the prevention of relapse.<ref name=Coch2011>{{cite journal | vauthors = Belgamwar RB, El-Sayeh HG | title = Aripiprazole versus placebo for schizophrenia | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 8 | pages = CD006622 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21833956 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006622.pub2 }}</ref> The World Federation of Societies for Biological Psychiatry recommends aripiprazole for the treatment of acute exacerbations of schizophrenia as a Grade 1 recommendation and evidence level A.<ref name="Hasan A, Falkai P, Wobrock T, Lieberman J, Glenthoj B, Gattaz WF, Thibaut F, Möller HJ 2013 2–44">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hasan A, Falkai P, Wobrock T, Lieberman J, Glenthoj B, Gattaz WF, Thibaut F, Möller HJ | title = World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) guidelines for biological treatment of schizophrenia, part 2: update 2012 on the long-term treatment of schizophrenia and management of antipsychotic-induced side effects | journal = The World Journal of Biological Psychiatry | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–44 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23216388 | doi = 10.3109/15622975.2012.739708 }}</ref>

The [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] offers the following recommendations with respect to pharmacological treatment of those presenting with an acute episode of psychosis:

* Offer an oral antipsychotic medication. 
* Inform those who want to try psychological interventions alone that these are more effective when performed in conjunction with treatment with an antipsychotic medication
* In the early post-acute period, warn the person of a high risk of relapse if antipsychotic medication is discontinued in the first 1–2 years after the acute episode
* If a decision is made to discontinue medication, reduce the dose gradually and monitor for relapse for at least 2 years.<ref name="nice.org.uk">{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/CG178 |title=Psychosis and schizophrenia in adults: treatment and management &#124; Guidance and guidelines &#124; NICE |publisher = National Institute for Health and Care Excellence }}</ref>

The British Association for Psychopharmacology similarly recommends that all persons presenting with psychosis receive treatment with an antipsychotic, and that such treatment should continue for at least 1–2 years, as "There is no doubt that antipsychotic discontinuation is strongly associated with relapse during this period". The guideline further notes that "Established schizophrenia requires continued maintenance with doses of antipsychotic medication within the recommended range (Evidence level A)" <ref name="Barnes TR 2011 567–620">{{cite journal | vauthors = Barnes TR | title = Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology | journal = Journal of Psychopharmacology | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 567–620 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21292923 | doi = 10.1177/0269881110391123 }}</ref>

The National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence,<ref name="nice.org.uk"/> the British Association for Psychopharmacology<ref name="Barnes TR 2011 567–620"/> and the World Federation of Societies for Biological Psychiatry suggest that there is little difference in effectiveness between antipsychotics in prevention of relapse, and recommend that the specific choice of antipsychotic be chosen based on persons preference and side effect profile. The latter group recommends switching to aripiprazole when excessive weight gain is encountered during treatment with other antipsychotics.<ref name="Hasan A, Falkai P, Wobrock T, Lieberman J, Glenthoj B, Gattaz WF, Thibaut F, Möller HJ 2013 2–44"/>

==Interactions==
Aripiprazole is a substrate of [[CYP2D6]] and [[CYP3A4]].

Precautions should be taken in patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics along with other medications that affect blood sugar levels and should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. The liquid form (oral solution) of this medication may contain up to 15 grams of sugar per dose.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.drugs.com/cons/abilify-intramuscular.html | title = Abilify (Intramuscular) | work = Drugs.com }}</ref> Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia (excessive thirst), polyuria (excessive urination), polyphagia (increased appetite), and weakness.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.drugs.com/pro/abilify.html | title = Abilify | work = Drugs.com }}</ref>

===Pharmacokinetics===
Aripiprazole displays linear kinetics and has an elimination half-life of approximately 75&nbsp;hours. Steady-state plasma concentrations are achieved in about 14&nbsp;days. C<sub>max</sub> (maximum plasma concentration) is achieved 3–5&nbsp;hours after oral dosing. [[Bioavailability]] of the oral tablets is about 90% and the drug undergoes extensive hepatic metabolization (dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and ''N''-dealkylation), principally by the enzymes [[CYP2D6]] and [[CYP3A4]]. Its only known active metabolite is dehydro-aripiprazole, which typically accumulates to approximately 40% of the aripiprazole concentration. The parenteral drug is excreted only in traces, and its metabolites, active or not, are excreted via feces and urine.<ref name="drugLabelPC">{{cite web |url=http://www.druglib.com/druginfo/abilify/pharmacology/ |title=Abilify (Aripiprazole) - Clinical Pharmacology |accessdate=8 December 2008 |publisher=DrugLib.com |date=14 February 2007 }}</ref> When dosed daily, brain concentrations of aripiprazole will increase for a period of 10–14&nbsp;days, before reaching stable constant levels.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}
