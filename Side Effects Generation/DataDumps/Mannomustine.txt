'''Mannomustine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]), also known as '''mannitol nitrogen mustard''', tradename '''Degranol''' is an old [[alkylating antineoplastic agent]] from the group of [[nitrogen mustard]]s. It was first synthesized and characterized in 1957 by Vargha et al.<ref>Vargha et al., J. Chem. Soc. 1957, 805.</ref>

The mechanism of [[antineoplastic drug|antineoplastic]] activity of mannomustine, like for all other alkylating agents, lies in its ability to [[alkyl]]ate [[DNA]] [[guanine]] [[nucleobase]]s and, thus, to prevent uncoupling of DNA strands, which is a required step for any cell to divide.

Mannomustine was, at the time of its creation as a drug, claimed to be considerably less toxic than [[mechlorethamine]]. For example, the LD<sub>50</sub> in rats, for intravenous mannomustine administration route, is claimed to be about 56&nbsp;mg/kg.<ref>Scherf et al., Arzneim.-Forsch. 20, 1467 (1970)</ref>
