Floxuridine primarily works by stopping the growth of newly born cells. The drug essentially stops [[DNA]] from forming in new and rapidly developing cells, which is a sign of a cancerous cell. Therefore, the floxuridine kills the cancerous cells. For colorectal cancer and [[hepatic metastases]], an average adult should be given an Intra-arterial dosage of 0.1–0.6&nbsp;mg/kg/day as a continuous [[infusion]], continued until intolerable toxicity is reached ([[white blood cell]] count <3,500/mm^3 or platelet count <100,000/mm^3).<ref>{{cite web|title=Floxuridine|url=https://www.drugs.com/ppa/floxuridine.html|website=Drugs.com}}</ref>

===Pharmacodynamics===
Floxuridine is a [[pyrimidine]] analog that acts as an inhibitor of the [[S-phase]] of cell division. This selectively kills rapidly dividing cells. [[Antimetabolites]] masquerade as [[pyrimidine]]-like molecules which prevents normal pyrimidines from being incorporated into DNA during the S phase of the cell cycle. [[Fluorouracil]] (the end-product of catabolism of floxuridine) blocks an [[enzyme]] which converts [[cytosine]] nucleosides into the deoxy [[derivative]]. In addition, DNA synthesis is further inhibited because fluoruracil blocks the incorporation of the [[thymidine]] [[nucleotide]] into the DNA strand.

===Mechanism of action ===
Floxuridine is rapidly catabolized to [[5-fluorouracil]], which is the active form of the drug. The primary effect is interference with DNA synthesis and to a lesser extent, inhibition of [[RNA]] formation through the drug's incorporation into [[RNA]], thus leading to the production of fraudulent RNA. Fluorouracil also inhibits [[uracil riboside phosphorylase]], which prevents the utilization of preformed [[uracil]] in RNA synthesis. As well, the [[monophosphate]] of floxuridine, [[5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-phosphate]] (FUDR-MP) inhibits the enzyme [[thymidylate synthetase]]. This leads to the inhibition of [[methylation]] of [[deoxyuridylic acid]] to [[thymidylic acid]], thus interfering with [[DNA synthesis]].

===Route of Elimination===
The drug is excreted intact and as [[urea]], [[fluorouracil]], α-fluoro-β-ureidopropionic acid, dihydrofluorouracil, α-fluoro-β-guanidopropionic acid and α-fluoro-β-alanine in the [[urine]]; it is also expired as respiratory [[carbon dioxide]].

===Common (30% of patients)===
* Low blood counts. Your white and [[red blood cells]] and [[platelets]] may temporarily decrease. This can put you at increased risk for infection, [[anemia]] and/or bleeding.
* Mouth sores
* Diarrhea (may be severe)

===Less common (10–29% of patients)===
* Poor [[appetite]]
* [[Nausea]] and [[vomiting]]
* [[Hair loss]]
* Elevated liver enzymes (temporary increase in [[alkaline phosphatase]], [[lactate dehydrogenase]], [[transaminase]], and [[bilirubin]]). This is seen more with the intra-arterial infusion directly into the liver.
* [[Hand-foot syndrome]] (Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia or PPE) -skin rash, [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]], redness, pain and/or peeling of the skin on the palms of hands and soles of feet
* [[Stomach ulcers]] (This is seen more with the intra-arterial infusion).

===Contact your health provider immediately===
* [[Fever]] of 100.4&nbsp;°F (38&nbsp;°C) or higher, chills (possible signs of infection).

===Contact your health provider===
* [[Diarrhea]] (2 episodes in a 24-hour period)
* [[Nausea]] (interferes with ability to eat and unrelieved with prescribed medication)
* [[Vomiting]] (vomiting more than 4–5 times in a 24 hour period)
* [[Mouth sores]] (painful redness, swelling or ulcers)
* Unusual bleeding or bruising
* Black or tarry stools, or blood in your stools
* Blood in the [[urine]]
* Yellowing of the skin or eyes
* Tingling or burning, redness, swelling of the palms of the hands or soles of feet

===Other===
* Fertility for both men and women may be affected by floxuridine.

==History==
Floxuridine first gained [[FDA]] approval in December 1970 under the brand name FUDR. The drug was initially marketed by [[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche]], which also did a lot of the initial work on [[5-fluorouracil]]. The [[National Cancer Institute]] was an early developer of the drug. Roche sold its FUDR product line in 2001 to [[F H Faulding]], which became [[Mayne Pharma]].
