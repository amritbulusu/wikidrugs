'''Roxarsone''' is an [[organoarsenic compound]] that is widely used in [[poultry production]] as a feed additive to increase weight gain and improve [[feed conversion ratio|feed efficiency]], and as a [[coccidiostat]].<ref name=FDA>{{cite news | author = U.S. Food and Drug Administration | url = http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/SafetyHealth/ProductSafetyInformation/ucm258313.htm | title = Questions and Answers Regarding 3-Nitro (Roxarsone) | date = June 8, 2011}}</ref> The drug is also approved in the [[United States]] for use in [[Swine production|pigs]].<ref name=FDA /> Roxarsone is marketed as '''3-Nitro''' by [[Zoetis]], a former subsidiary of [[Pfizer]] now a publicly traded company. In 2006, approximately one million kilograms of roxarsone were produced in the U.S.<ref>{{cite news | author = Hileman, B. | url = http://pubs.acs.org/cen/government/85/8515gov2.html | title = Arsenic in Chicken Production | publisher = [[Chemical and Engineering News]] | date = April 9, 2007 | pages = 34–35}}</ref>

Roxarsone is one of four [[arsenical]] animal drugs approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for use in poultry and/or swine, along with [[nitarsone]], [[arsanilic acid]], and [[carbarsone]].<ref name=FDA /> In September 2013, the FDA announced that [[Zoetis]] and [[Fleming Laboratories]] would voluntarily withdraw current roxarsone, [[arsanilic acid]], and [[carbarsone]] approvals, leaving only [[nitarsone]] approvals in place.<ref>{{cite news | author = U.S. Food and Drug Administration | url = http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/SafetyHealth/ProductSafetyInformation/ucm370568.htm | title = FDA Response to Citizen Petition on Arsenic-based Animal Drugs | date = September 20, 2011}}</ref> In 2015 FDA withdraw the approval of using nitarsone in animal feeds.

==Production and applications==
Roxarsone is a derivative of [[phenylarsonic acid]] (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>As(O)(OH)<sub>2</sub>). It was first reported in a 1923 British patent that described the [[nitration]] and [[diazotization]] of [[arsanilic acid]].<ref>GB 226255 19230718</ref> When blended with calcite powder, it is used in poultry feed premixes and is usually available in 5%, 20% and 50% concentrations.

==Controversy==
Roxarsone has attracted attention as a source of [[arsenic]] contamination of poultry and other foods.<ref>{{cite news | author = Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy | url = http://www.iatp.org/documents/playing-chicken-avoiding-arsenic-in-your-meat | title = Playing Chicken: Avoiding Arsenic in Your Meat | date = April 4, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | author = Consumer Reports | url = http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2012/11/arsenic-in-your-food/index.htm | title = Arsenic in your food | date = November 2012}}</ref> In July 2011, Pfizer suspended sale of roxarsone in the U.S. in response to a study by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA);<ref name=FDA2>{{cite news | author = U.S. Food and Drug Administration | url = http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm258342.htm | title = FDA: Pfizer will voluntarily suspend sale of animal drug 3-Nitro | date = June 8, 2011}}</ref> the FDA found that roxarsone use was associated with elevated levels of [[inorganic arsenic]] in chicken livers.<ref>{{cite news | author = Cevallos, M. | url = http://www.latimes.com/health/boostershots/la-heb-arsenic-chicken-pfizer-20110608,0,6568583.story | title = Arsenic-containing drug in chicken feed to be pulled from U.S | publisher = [[LA Times]] | date = June 9, 2011}}</ref> An FDA press release stated that the findings raised "concerns of a very low but completely avoidable exposure to a carcinogen."<ref name=FDA2 /> The voluntary suspension does not preempt Pfizer from selling roxarsone in the future, as FDA has not withdrawn its approval to market the drug in the U.S.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news |author1=Gardiner Harris  |author2=Denise Grady  |lastauthoramp=yes | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/09/business/09arsenic.html | title = Pfizer Suspends Sales of Chicken Drug With Arsenic | publisher = [[New York Times]] | date = June 8, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | author = U.S. Food and Drug Administration | url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/animaldrugsatfda | title = Animal Drugs @ FDA}}</ref> As of 2011, roxarsone was approved for use in 14 other countries as well.<ref name=NYT />

A 2013 [[market basket]] study linked the use of roxarsone and other arsenical feed additives to increased levels of inorganic arsenic in [[Poultry#Cuts of poultry|chicken breast meat]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=KE Nachman |author2=PA Baron |author3=G Raber |author4=KA Francesconi |author5=A Navas-Acien |author6=DC Love | title = Roxarsone, Inorganic Arsenic, and Other Arsenic Species in Chicken: A U.S.-Based Market Basket Sample | journal = [[Environmental Health Perspectives]] | year = 2013 | url = http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/121/5/ehp.1206245.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | author = Sabrina Tavernise | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/11/health/study-finds-an-increase-in-arsenic-levels-in-chicken.html | title = Study Finds an Increase in Arsenic Levels in Chicken | publisher = New York Times | date = May 11, 2013}}</ref> Breast meat from conventionally produced chickens (in which arsenical use is permitted under U.S. law) had three times more inorganic arsenic than did breast meat from chickens produced according to USDA Organic standards. The USDA Organic program prohibits arsenical use in organic chicken production. The researchers also found that inorganic arsenic concentrations were almost three times higher in samples with detectable levels of roxarsone than in samples without detectable roxarsone.
