The positive effects of the drug include muscle growth, appetite stimulation and increased [[red blood cell]] production,{{medcn|date=July 2015}} and [[bone density]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK278943/|title=Endotext|last=Handelsman|first=David J|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=De Groot|editor-first=Leslie J|location=|pages=|at=4.1.2 Pharmacologic Androgen Therapy|chapter=Androgen Physiology, Pharmacology and Abuse|quote="Both testosterone and its non-aromatizable derivative nandrolone, produce increased bone density in men with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis with minimal short-term side-effects...."|via=NCBI Bookshelf}}</ref> Clinical studies have shown it to be effective in treating [[anemia]], [[osteoporosis]] and some forms of [[neoplasia]] including [[breast cancer]], and also acts as a [[progestin]]-based [[contraceptive]].

Other side effects of high doses of nandrolone can include [[erectile dysfunction]] and [[cardiovascular]] damage, as well as several ailments resulting from the drug's effect of lowering levels of [[luteinizing hormone]] through [[negative feedback]]. Erectile dysfunction is attributed to the weaker action of DHN in the penis since [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT) is a known sexual modulator.{{mcn|date=February 2017}}

Estrane and gonane progestogens are derived from 19-nortestosterone, the progestogenic parent compound used in oral contraceptives in the United States. Estranes are characterized by the presence of an ethinyl group at position 17 and by the absence of a methyl group between the A and B rings (see Fig. 10). The estrane progestogens that are related structurally to norethindrone (norethynodrel, lynestrenol, norethindrone acetate, ethynodiol diacetate) are converted to this parent compound. Norethindrone is the second most commonly used progestogen in the United States for HRT. Gonanes. The gonanes share the structural modifications found in the estranes and also possess an ethinyl group at position 13 and a keto group at position 3 (see Fig. 11). Norgestrel was synthesized in 1963 and is a racemic mixture of dextro and levorotatory forms. The levorotatory form, levonorgestrel, provides the biologic activity.

The elaboration of a method for the reduction of aromatic rings to the corresponding dihydrobenzenes under controlled conditions by A. J. Birch opened a convenient route to compounds related to the putative [[19-norprogesterone]].

This reaction, now known as the [[Birch reduction]],<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1039/QR9500400069|title=The reduction of organic compounds by metal-ammonia solutions|journal=Quarterly Reviews, Chemical Society|volume=4|pages=69|year=1950|last1=Birch|first1=Arthur J.}}</ref> is typified by the treatment of the monomethyl ether of [[estradiol]] ('''1''') with a solution of lithium metal in liquid ammonia in the presence of alcohol as a proton source. Initial reaction constituents of 1,4-dimetalation of the most electron deficient positions of the aromatic ring–in the case of an estrogen, the 1 and 4-positions. Rxn of the intermediate with the proton source leads to a dihydrobenzene; a special virtue of this sequence in steroids is the fact that the double bind at 2 is in effect becomes an enol ether moiety. Treatment of this product ('''2''') with weak acid, [[oxalic acid]] for e.g., leads to the hydrolysis of the enol ether, producing β,γ-unconjugated ketone '''3'''. Hydrolysis under more strenuous conditions ([[mineral acids]]) results in migration/conjugation of the olefin to yield nandrolone ('''4''').

A number of nandrolone cases in [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] occurred in 1999, which included high-profile athletes such as [[Merlene Ottey]], [[Dieter Baumann]] and [[Linford Christie]].<ref>Baron, Peter (2000-09-19).

Retrieved on 2010-11-13.</ref> However, the following year the detection method for nandrolone at the time was proved to be faulty. [[Mark Richardson (athlete)|Mark Richardson]], a British Olympic relay runner who tested positive for the substance, gave a significant amount of urine samples in a controlled environment and delivered a positive test for the drug, demonstrating that false positives could occur, which led to an overhaul of his competitive ban.<ref name="urlAthletics: Mark Richardson explains how he felt at his disciplinary hearing | Sport | The Guardian">{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2004/feb/19/athletics.comment | title = Athletics: Mark Richardson explains how he felt at his disciplinary hearing | author = Richardson M | date = 2004-02-19 | format = | work = Athletics | publisher = The Guardian | quote = It was as daunting a line-up as I had ever faced on athletics tracks | accessdate = 2010-11-13 | location=London}}</ref>

Heavy consumption of the essential amino acid [[lysine]] (as indicated in the treatment of cold sores) has allegedly shown false positives in some and was cited by American [[shotput]]ter [[C. J. Hunter]] as the reason for his positive test, though in 2004 he admitted to a federal [[grand jury]] that he had injected nandrolone.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15027417 | title = Track Star Marion Jones to Admit Steroid Use | publisher = National Public Radio | date = 2007-10-05 | accessdate = 2009-11-09 }}</ref> A possible cause of incorrect urine test results is the presence of metabolites from other AAS, though modern [[urinalysis]] can usually determine the exact steroid used by analyzing the ratio of the two remaining nandrolone metabolites. As a result of the numerous overturned verdicts, the testing procedure was reviewed by [[UK Sport]]. On October 5, 2007, three-time Olympic gold medalist for track and field [[Marion Jones]] admitted to use of the drug, and was sentenced to six months in jail for lying to a federal grand jury in 2000.<ref>{{Cite report | author = UK Sport Anti-doping Directorate |date=January 2000 | title = Nandrolone Review | url=http://www.uksport.gov.uk/images/uploaded/nandrevv2.pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050404200642/http://www.uksport.gov.uk/images/uploaded/nandrevv2.pdf | archivedate=2005-04-04 | publisher=[[UK Sport]] | format = PDF | accessdate = 2013-02-02 }}</ref>

[[Mass spectrometry]] is also used to detect small samples of nandrolone in urine samples, as it has a unique molar mass.

==Research==
Nandrolone has been studied in several indications. It was intensively studied for [[osteoporosis]], and increased calcium uptake and decreased bone loss, but caused virilization in about half of the women who took it; it was abandoned for this use when better drugs like the [[bisphosphonate]]s became available.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pan|first1=MM|last2=Kovac|first2=JR|title=Beyond testosterone cypionate: evidence behind the use of nandrolone in male health and wellness.|journal=Translational andrology and urology|date=April 2016|volume=5|issue=2|pages=213-9|pmid=27141449|pmc=4837307}}</ref>

It has also been studied in clinical trials for chronic kidney failure, aplastic anaemia, and as a male contraceptive.<ref name=HemmersbachChapter2009/>{{rp|134}}
