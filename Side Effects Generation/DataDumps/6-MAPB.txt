'''6-MAPB''' (1-(benzofuran-6-yl)-N-methylpropan-2-amine) is a psychedelic and entactogenic drug which is structurally related to [[6-APB]] and [[MDMA]]. It is not known to have been widely sold as a "designer drug" but has been detected in analytical samples taken from individuals hospitalised after using drug combinations that included other benzofuran derivatives.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} 6-MAPB was banned in the UK in June 2013, along with 9 other related compounds which were thought to produce similar effects.<ref name='ACMD report'>{{cite web | url = https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/temporary-class-drug-order-report-on-benzofury-and-nbome-compounds | title = Temporary class drug order report on 5-6APB and NBOMe compounds | accessdate = 2013-07-10 | date = 4 Jun 2013 | publisher = UK Home Office}}</ref>
