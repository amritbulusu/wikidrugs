'''Sivifene''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]; developmental code name '''A-007''') is a [[small-molecule]] [[antineoplastic agent]] and [[immunomodulator]] that was under development in the 2000s by Tigris Pharmaceuticals (now Kirax Corporation) as a [[topical administration|topical]] treatment for [[skin|cutaneous]] [[cancer]] [[metastasis|metastases]].<ref name="AdisInsight">http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800002477</ref><ref name="pmid16184382">{{cite journal | vauthors = Eilender D, LoRusso P, Thomas L, McCormick C, Rodgers AH, Hooper CL, Tornyos K, Krementz ET, Parker S, Morgan LR | title = 4,4'-Dihydroxybenzophenone-2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone (A-007): a topical treatment for cutaneous metastases from malignant cancers | journal = Cancer Chemother.

Initially, due to its structural similarity to [[tamoxifen]], sivifene was thought to be a [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]] (SERM), but subsequent research revealed that it does not bind to the [[estrogen receptor]] (ER) and does not possess [[antiestrogen]]ic activity.<ref name="pmid16184382" /> The actual [[mechanism of action]] of sivifene is unknown, but it is thought to produce its immunomodulating effects via [[upregulation]] of the [[CD45]] [[T-lymphocyte]] [[cell surface receptor]].<ref name="pmid16184382" />
