Norethisterone, a progestogen still used worldwide, was synthesized by Djerassi in 1951. But this progestogen was not used immediately and in 1953 Colton discovered norethynodrel, used by Pincus in the first oral contraceptive. Numerous other progestogens were subsequently synthesized, e.g., lynestrenol and ethynodiol diacetate, which were, in fact, prhormones converted in vivo to norethisterone. All these progestogens were also able to induce androgenic effects when high doses were used. More potent progestogens were synthesized in the 1960s, e.g. norgestrel, norgestrienone. These progestogens were also more androgenic.}}</ref> Although ethisterone has largely been superseded by newer drugs and is now little used, it reportedly continues to be available in some countries.<ref name="IndexNominum2000" /> Moreover, the [[19-nortestosterone]] progestins, such as [[norethisterone]], are derived from ethisterone and are widely used as [[hormonal contraceptive]]s and for other indications.

==Pharmacology==
Ethisterone is described as a relatively weak progestogen, similarly to its analogue [[dimethisterone]].<ref name="Kurman2013">{{cite book|author=Robert J.

===Androgenic activity===
Based on ''[[in vitro]]'' research, ethisterone and norethisterone are about equipotent in their [[EC50|EC<sub>50</sub>]] values for the [[androgen receptor]] (AR), whereas, conversely, norethisterone shows markedly increased potency relative to ethisterone in terms of its EC<sub>50</sub> for the [[progesterone receptor]] (PR).<ref name="pmid18395441">{{cite journal | vauthors = McRobb L, Handelsman DJ, Kazlauskas R, Wilkinson S, McLeod MD, Heather AK | title = Structure-activity relationships of synthetic progestins in a yeast-based in vitro androgen bioassay | journal = J.

===Estrogenic activity===
High dosages of norethisterone and [[noretynodrel]], which are 19-nortestosterone derivatives of ethisterone, were found to be associated with high rates of [[estrogen]]ic [[side effect]]s such as [[breast enlargement]] in women and [[gynecomastia]] in men, as well as with improvement of [[menopause|menopausal]] symptoms in postmenopausal women.<ref name="pmid13942007">{{cite journal | vauthors = PAULSEN CA, LEACH RB, LANMAN J, GOLDSTON N, MADDOCK WO, HELLER CG | title = Inherent estrogenicity of norethindrone and norethynodrel: comparison with other synthetic progestins and progesterone | journal = J.

In 1951, it was demonstrated that removal of the 19-carbon from ethisterone to form norethindrone did not destroy the oral activity, and most importantly, it changed the major hormonal effect from that of an androgen to that of a progestational agent. Accordingly, the progestational derivatives of testosterone were designated as 19-nortestosterones (denoting the missing 19-carbon).}}</ref> It was derived from testosterone via [[ethynyl]]ation at the C17α position, and it was hoped, that, analogously to [[estradiol]] and [[ethinylestradiol]], ethisterone would be an orally active form of testosterone.<ref name="Kuhl2011">{{cite journal | author = Kuhl H | title = Pharmacology of Progestogens | journal = J Reproduktionsmed Endokrinol | year = 2011 | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 157–177 | format = PDF | url = http://www.kup.at/kup/pdf/10168.pdf}}</ref> However, the androgenic activity of ethisterone was attenuated and it showed considerable progestogenic activity.<ref name="Kuhl2011" /> As such, it was developed as a progestogen instead and was marketed in [[Germany]] in 1939 as '''Proluton C''' and by [[Schering-Plough|Schering]] in the [[United States|U.S.]] in 1945 as '''Pranone''', among other brand names.<ref name="LauritzenStudd2005" /><ref name="Roth2014">{{cite book|author=Klaus Roth|title=Chemische Leckerbissen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FsKpBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA69|year=2014|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-3-527-33739-2|page=69|quote=Im Prinzip hatten Hohlweg und Inhoffen die Lösung schon 1938 in der Hand, denn ihr Ethinyltestosteron (11) war eine oral wirksame gestagene Verbindung und Schering hatte daraus bereits 1939 ein Medikament (Proluton C®) entwickelt.}}</ref>
