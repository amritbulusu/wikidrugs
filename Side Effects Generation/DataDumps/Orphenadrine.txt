'''Orphenadrine''' (sold under many [[brand names]] worldwide<ref name=Drugs.com>[http://www.drugs.com/international/orphenadrine.html Drugs.com international listings for orphenadrine] Page accessed Feb 5, 2016</ref>) is an [[anticholinergic]] [[drug]] of the [[ethanolamine]] [[antihistamine]] class; it is closely related to [[diphenhydramine]]. It is used to treat muscle pain and to help with motor control in [[Parkinson's disease]], but has largely been superseded by newer drugs.   It was discovered and developed in the 1940s.

As of 2015 the cost for a typical month of medication in the United States is US$25 to 50.<ref name=Ric2015>{{cite book|last1=Hamilton|first1=Richart|title=Tarascon Pocket Pharmacopoeia 2015 Deluxe Lab-Coat Edition|date=2015|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning|isbn=9781284057560|page=2}}</ref>

== Medical use==
Orphenadrine is used to relieve pain caused by muscle injuries like [[Strain (injury)|strains]] and [[sprains]] in combination with rest and physical therapy.<ref name=Medline>Medline Plus. [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682162.html Medline Plus entry for Orphenadrine]. Page last updated December 1, 2010.  Page accessed February 6, 2016]</ref>  A 2004 review found fair evidence that orphenadrine is effective for acute back or neck pain, but found insufficient evidence to establish the relative efficacy of the drug in relation to other drugs in the study.<ref>Chou R, Peterson K, Helfand M. Comparative efficacy and safety of skeletal muscle relaxants for spasticity and musculoskeletal conditions: a systematic review. J Pain Symptom Manage. 2004 Aug;28(2):140-75. {{PMID|15276195}}</ref>

Orphenadrine and other muscle relaxants are sometimes used to treat pain arising from [[rheumatoid arthritis]] but there is no evidence they are effective for that purpose.<ref>Richards BL, Whittle SL, Buchbinder R. Muscle relaxants for pain management in rheumatoid arthritis. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2012 Jan 18;1:CD008922. {{PMID|22258993}}</ref>

A 2003 [[Cochrane Review]] of the use of [[anticholinergic]] drugs to improve motor function in [[Parkinson's disease]] found that as a class, the drugs are useful for that purpose; it identified one single-site randomised, cross-over study of orphenadrine vs placebo.<ref name=CochranePD2003>Katzenschlager R, et al. Anticholinergics for symptomatic management of Parkinson's disease. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2003;(2):CD003735. {{PMID|12804486}}</ref> Orphenadrine and other anticholinergics have largely been superseded by other drugs; they have a use in alleviating motor function symptoms, and appear to help about 20% of people with Parkinson's.<ref name=Marsden/>

== Side effects ==
Orphenadrine has the side effects of the other common antihistamines in large part. Stimulation is somewhat more common than with other related antihistamines, and is especially common in the elderly. Common side effects include dry mouth, dizziness, drowsiness, upset stomach or vomiting, constipation, urine retention, blurred vision, and headache.<ref name=Medline/>   Its use in Parkinson's is especially limited by these factors.<ref name=CochranePD2003/>

People with [[glaucoma]], digestive problems like [[peptic ulcers]] or [[bowel obstruction]], or [[Achalasia|sphincter relaxation disorders]], or with [[Benign prostatic hyperplasia|enlarged prostate]], bladder problems, or [[myasthenia gravis]], should not take this drug.<ref name=ExtendedRelLabel>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/anda/99/40249_Orphenadrine%20Citrate_Prntlbl.pdf Orphenadrine Citrate Extended release label] Revised October 1998</ref>

=== Preparations ===
Orphenadrine has been available as a citrate salt and a hydrochloride salt; in the US as of February 2016 the citrate form was available in tablets, extended release tablets, and by injection for acute use in a hospital setting.<ref name=Drugs.com/><ref>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.Overview&DrugName=ORPHENADRINE%20CITRATE FDA listing of Orphenadrine citrate registrations].

Orphenadrine is often available mixed with [[aspirin]], [[paracetamol|paracetamol/acetaminophen]], [[ibuprofen]], [[caffeine]], and/or [[codeine]].<ref name=Drugs.com/>

== History ==
[[George Rieveschl]] was a professor of chemistry at the [[University of Cincinnati]] and led a research program working on [[antihistamines]].  In 1943, one of his students, Fred Huber, synthesized [[diphenhydramine]].  Rieveschl worked with [[Parke-Davis]] to test the compound, and the company licensed the patent from him.  In 1947 Parke-Davis  hired him as their Director of Research.  While he was there, he led the development of orphenadrine, an analog of diphenhydramine.<ref name=HistDD>Walter Sneader.

Prior to the development of [[amantadine]] in the late 1960s and then other drugs, anticholinergics like orphenadrine were the mainstay of Parkinson's treatment.<ref name=Marsden>Ivan Donaldson, C.
