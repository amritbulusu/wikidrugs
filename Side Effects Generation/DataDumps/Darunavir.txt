== Adverse effects ==
Darunavir is generally well tolerated by people. Rash is the most common side effect (7% of patients).<ref name=":0" /> Other common side effects are diarrhea (2.3%), headache (3.8%), abdominal pain (2.3%), constipation (2.3%), and vomiting (1.5%).<ref name=":0" /> Darunavir can also cause allergic reactions, and people allergic to ritonavir can also have a reaction to darunavir.<ref name=":0" />

[[Hyperglycemia|High blood sugar]], [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] or worsening of diabetes, [[Myalgia|muscle pain]], tenderness or weakness, and increased bleeding in people with [[Haemophilia|hemophilia]] have been reported in patients taking protease inhibitor medicines like darunavir.<ref name=":0" /> Changes in body fat have been seen in some patients taking medicines for HIV, including loss of fat from legs, arms and face, increased fat in the abdomen and other internal organs, breast enlargement, and fatty lumps on the back of the neck. The cause and long-term health effects of these conditions are not known.<ref name=":0" />

=== Drug interactions ===
Darunavir may interact with medications commonly taken by people with [[HIV/AIDS]] such as other antiretrovirals, and antacids such as [[Proton-pump inhibitor|proton pump inhibitors]] and [[H2 receptor antagonists]].<ref name=":0" /> [[St. John's wort]] may reduce the effectiveness of darunavir by increasing the breakdown of darunavir by the metabolic enzyme ''[[CYP3A]]''.<ref name=":0" />

==Mechanism of action==
Darunavir is a nonpeptidic inhibitor of protease (PR) that lodges itself in the active site of PR through a number of hydrogen bonds.<ref name="Leonis, G. 2012">{{cite journal | last1 = Leonis | first1 = G. | last2 = Czyznikowska | first2 = Z. | display-authors = 2 | last3 = et al | year = 2012 | title = Computational Studies of Darunavir into HIV-1 Protease and DMPC Bilayer: Necessary Conditions for Effective Binding and the Role of the Flaps | url = | journal = J. Chem. Inf. Model | volume = 52 | issue = | pages = 1542–1558 | doi=10.1021/ci300014z}}</ref>  It was developed to increase interactions with HIV-1 protease and to be more resistant against HIV-1 protease mutations. With a Kd value of 4.5 x 10<sup>−12</sup> M, darunavir has a much stronger interaction with PR and its dissociation constant is 1/100 to 1/1000 of other protease inhibitors.<ref name="King, N. M. 2004">{{cite journal | last1 = King | first1 = N. M. | last2 = Prabu-Jeyabalan | first2 = M. | display-authors = 2 | last3 = et al | year = 2004 | title = Structural and Thermodynamic Basis for the Binding of TMC114, a Next-Generation Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 Protease Inhibitor | url = | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 78 | issue = | page = 21 }}</ref> This strong interaction comes from increased hydrogen bonds between darunavir and the backbone of the PR active site (Figure 2). Darunavir’s structure allows it to create more hydrogen bonds with the PR active site than most PIs that have been developed and approved by the FDA.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite journal | last1 = Lefebvre | first1 = E. | last2 = Schiffer | first2 = C. A. | year = 2008 | title = Resilience to Resistance of HIV-1 Protease Inhibitors: Profile of Darunavir | url = | journal = AIDS Rev. | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 131–142 }}</ref> Furthermore, the backbone of HIV-1 protease maintains its spatial conformation in the presence of mutations.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lascar | first1 = R. M. | last2 = Benn | first2 = P. | year = 2009 | title = Role of darunavir in the management of HIV infection | url = | journal = HIV AIDS (Auckl) | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 31–39 }}</ref> Because darunavir interacts with this stable portion of the protease, the PR-PI interaction is less likely to be disrupted by a mutation.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

Ribbon structure of PR with darunavir in active site: Structures colored as in Fig. 1. with certain residues partaking in hydrogen bonding further highlighted. The catalytic aspartates, 25 and 25’, are in orange and the other interacting residues in green. Right image is a magnified view of the image on the left (PDB 4qdb).]]

===Catalytic site===

The chemical activity of the HIV-1 protease depends on two residues in the active site, Asp25 and Asp25’, one from each copy of the homodimer.<ref name="Zhang, Y. 2014">{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = D. | last2 = Zhang | first2 = Y. | display-authors = 2 | last3 = et al | year = 2014 | title = Investigation on the mechanism for the binding and drug resistance of wild type and mutations of G86 residue in HIV-1 protease complexed with Darunavir by molecular dynamic simulation and free energy calculation | url = | journal = J. Molecular Modeling | volume = 20 | issue = | page = 2122 | doi=10.1007/s00894-014-2122-y}}</ref> Darunavir interacts with these catalytic aspartates and the backbone of the active site through hydrogen bonds, specifically binding to residues Asp25, Asp25’, Asp 29, Asp 30, Asp 30’, and Gly 27 (Figure 3). This interaction prevents viral replication, as it competitively inhibits the viral polypeptides from gaining access to the active site and strongly binds to the enzymatic portions of this protein.<ref name="Leonis, G. 2012"/>

==Cost==
In the US and UK, healthcare costs were estimated to be lower with boosted darunavir than with investigator-selected control protease inhibitors in treatment-experienced patients.<ref name="darunavir">{{cite journal | last1 = McKeage | first1 = K | last2 = Perry | first2 = CM | last3 = Keam | first3 = SJ | year = 2009 | title =  Darunavir| url = | journal = Drugs | volume = 69 | issue = 4| pages = 477–503 | doi = 10.2165/00003495-200969040-00007 }}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Figure 2a.tiff|thumb|Figure 2. Hydrogen bonds between darunavir and HIV-1 protease: The bonds with the red residues indicate hydrogen bonds that are also present between the PI saquinavir and HIV-1 protease. The hydrogen bonds with the blue residue are unique to darunavir.]]

Darunavir was developed by [[Tibotec]], and was named after Arun K. Ghosh, who discovered the molecule at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chem.purdue.edu/ghosh/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704161724/http://www.chem.purdue.edu/ghosh/ |archivedate=2007-07-04 |df= }}</ref> It was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) on June 23, 2006.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60499-1 | volume=369 | title=Darunavir: promising initial results | journal=The Lancet | pages=1143–1144}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/newsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2006/ucm108676.htm|title=2006 - FDA Approves New HIV Treatment for Patients Who Do Not Respond to Existing Drugs|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-11-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113210634/http://www.fda.gov/newsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2006/ucm108676.htm|archivedate=2016-11-13|df=}}</ref>

The development of first-generation clinical inhibitors was founded on creating more protease-ligand interactions through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions.<ref name="Leonis, G. 2012"/> The first HIV protease inhibitor approved by the FDA was saquinavir, which was designed to target wild-type HIV-1 protease.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1 = F. | last2 = Kovalevsky | first2 = A.Y. | year = 2008 | title = Effect of Flap Mutations on Structure of HIV-1 Protease and Inhibition by Saquinavir and Darunavir | doi = 10.1016/j.jmb.2008.05.062| journal = J. Mol. Biol. | volume = 381 | issue = 1| pages = 102–115 }}</ref> However, this inhibitor is no longer effective due to resistance-causing mutations on the HIV-1 protease structure. The HIV genome has high plasticity, so has been able to become resistant to multiple HIV-1 protease inhibitors.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Eron | first1 = J | year = 2000 | title = HIV-1 Protease Inhibitors | url = | journal = Oxford Journal of Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 160–170 }}</ref> Since saquinavir, the FDA has approved several PIs, including darunavir.<ref name="FDA 2011">"HIV/AIDS Historical Time Line 2000-2010" FDA. 2011.</ref> Darunavir was granted approval by the FDA on June 23, 2006, and is one of the most recently developed protease inhibitors approved for treatment of HIV.<ref name="FDA 2011"/>
