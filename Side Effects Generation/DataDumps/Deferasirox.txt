According to FDA (May 2007), [[renal failure]] and [[cytopenia]]s have been reported in patients receiving deferasirox oral suspension tablets. It is approved in the [[European Union]] by the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) for children 6 years and older for chronic iron overload from repeated blood transfusions.<ref>[http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Summary_for_the_public/human/000670/WC500033927.pdf Exjade - deferasirox], from EMA website</ref><ref>[http://www.lancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2813%2960799-0/fulltext Turning a blind eye to deferasirox's toxicity? ], ''[[The Lancet]]'', Volume 381, No. 9873, p1183–1184, 6 April 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.ehealthme.com/q/exjade-side-effects-drug-interactions Review: Exjade side effects]</ref>

==Properties of deferasirox==
[[Image:Deferasirox–iron(III) complex.png|thumb|left|Two deferasirox molecules binding iron]]
The half-life of deferasirox is between 8 and 16 hours allowing once a day dosing. Two molecules of deferasirox are capable of binding to 1 atom of iron which are subsequently eliminated by fecal excretion. Its low molecular weight and high lipophilicity allows the drug to be taken orally unlike [[deferoxamine]] which has to be administered by IV route (intravenous infusion). Together with [[deferiprone]], deferasirox seems to be capable of removing iron from cells (cardiac myocytes and hepatocytes) as well as removing iron from the blood.

==Synthesis==
Deferasirox can be prepared from simple commercially available starting materials (salicylic acid, salicylamide and 4-hydrazinobenzoic acid) in the following two-step synthetic sequence:
[[Image:Deferasirox synthesis.png|center|Image to be added]]
The condensation of salicyloyl chloride (formed ''in situ'' from salicylic acid and thionyl chloride) with salicylamide under dehydrating reaction conditions results in formation of 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1,3(4''H'')-benzoxazin-4-one. This intermediate is isolated and reacted with 4-hydrazinobenzoic acid in the presence of base to give 4-(3,5-bis(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)benzoic acid (Deferasirox).<ref name=Steinhauser>{{cite journal |author=Stefan Steinhauser |author2=Uwe Heinz |author3=Mark Bartholomä |author4=Thomas Weyhermüller |author5=Hanspeter Nick |author6=Kaspar Hegetschweiler |title=Complex Formation of ICL670 and Related Ligands with Fe<sup>III</sup> and Fe<sup>II</sup> |journal=European Journal of Inorganic Chemistry |volume=2004 |issue=21 |pages=4177–4192 |year=2004 |doi=10.1002/ejic.200400363}}]</ref>

==Risks==
Deferasirox was the #2 drug on the list of 'Most frequent suspected drugs in reported patient deaths' compiled by the Institute for Safe Medical Practices in 2009. There were 1320 deaths reported, perhaps explained by an update to the ADE data of Novartis, and a new boxed warning about gastrointestinal haemorrhage as well as kidney and liver failure.
