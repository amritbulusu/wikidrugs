'''Tegaserod''' is a [[serotonin|5-HT]]<sub>4</sub> [[agonist]] manufactured by [[Novartis]] and sold under the names '''Zelnorm''' and '''Zelmac''' for the management of [[irritable bowel syndrome]] and [[constipation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pharma.us.novartis.com/newsroom/pressReleases/releaseDetail.jsp?PRID=2004 |title= New Data for Zelnorm |accessdate= March 30, 2007}}</ref> Approved by the FDA in 2002, it was subsequently removed from the market in 2007 due to FDA concerns about possible adverse cardiovascular effects.  Before then, it was the only drug approved by the [[United States of America|United States]] [[Food and Drug Administration]] to help relieve the [[abdomen|abdominal]] discomfort, [[bloating]], and constipation associated with irritable bowel syndrome.  Its use was also approved to treat chronic [[idiopathic]] constipation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2002/ANS01160.html |title=FDA approves first treatment for women with irritable-bowel syndrome |accessdate= March 30, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070205163603/http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2002/ANS01160.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = February 5, 2007}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
The drug functions as a [[motility]] stimulant, achieving its desired therapeutic effects through activation of the 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors of the [[enteric nervous system]] in the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]]. It also stimulates gastrointestinal motility and the [[peristalsis|peristaltic]] reflex, and allegedly reduces abdominal pain.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rossi |first=S. |title=Australian Medicines Handbook |year=2004 |publisher=Health Communication Network |location=Adelaide |isbn=0-9578521-4-2 }}</ref> Additionally, tegaserod is a [[5-HT2B receptor|5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor]] antagonist.<ref name="pmid15466450">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Beattie DT, Smith JA, Marquess D, etal |title=The 5-HT4 receptor agonist, tegaserod, is a potent 5-HT2B receptor antagonist in vitro and in vivo |journal=Br.

==Withdrawal from market==

On 30 March 2007, the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] requested that Novartis withdraw Zelnorm from shelves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2007/ucm108879.htm |title= FDA Announces Discontinued Marketing of GI Drug, Zelnorm, for Safety Reasons |date = 30 March 2007 |publisher= FDA Press Release}}</ref> The FDA alleges a relationship between prescriptions of the drug and increased risks of heart attack or stroke. An analysis of data collected on over 18,000 patients demonstrated adverse cardiovascular events in 13 of 11,614 patients treated with Zelnorm (a rate of 0.11%) as compared with 1 of 7,031 patients treated with placebo (a rate of 0.01%). Novartis alleges all of the affected patients had preexisting cardiovascular disease or risk factors for such, and further alleges that no causal relationship between tegaserod use and cardiovascular events has been demonstrated.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.zelnorm.com/Zelnrom_PR_US_330_Final_12_1007.pdf |format=PDF| title = Zelnorm | publisher = [[Novartis]] | accessdate = 2007-03-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070410024119/http://www.zelnorm.com/Zelnrom_PR_US_330_Final_12_1007.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-04-10}}</ref>
On the same day as the FDA announcement, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada announced that it was suspending marketing and sales of the drug in  Canada in response to a request from [[Health Canada]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/March2007/30/c9000.html |title=Novartis suspends Canadian marketing and sales of Zelnorm in response to request from Health Canada |accessdate= 2007-03-30 }}</ref> In a large cohort study based on a US health insurance database, no increase in the risk of cardiovascular events were found under tegaserod treatment.<ref>{{cite journal|title= Tegaserod and the Risk of Cardiovascular Ischemic Events: An Observational Cohort Study| pmid=20200325 | doi=10.1177/1074248409360357 | volume=15| issue=2| journal=J Cardiovasc Pharmacol Ther| pages=151–7| vauthors=Loughlin J, Quinn S, Rivero E, Wong J, Huang J, Kralstein J, Earnest DL, Seeger JD| year=2010 }}</ref> Currently, tegaserod may only be used in emergency situations only with prior authorization from the FDA.<ref>http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm103223.htm</ref>
