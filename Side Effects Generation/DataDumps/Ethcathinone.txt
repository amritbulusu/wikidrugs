'''Ethcathinone''', also known as '''ethylpropion''' or '''ETH-CAT''', is a [[stimulant]] [[drug]] of the [[substituted phenethylamine|phenethylamine]], [[substituted amphetamine|amphetamine]], and [[substituted cathinone|cathinone]] [[chemical class]]es. It is an active [[metabolite]] of the [[prodrug]] [[diethylcathinone]] and is fully responsible for its effects. Ethcathinone has been identified as an ingredient in both quasi-legal "[[party pills]]",<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Camilleri | first1 = A | last2 = Johnston | first2 = MR | last3 = Brennan | first3 = M | last4 = Davis | first4 = S | last5 = Caldicott | first5 = DG | title = Chemical analysis of four capsules containing the controlled substance analogues 4-methylmethcathinone, 2-fluoromethamphetamine, alpha-phthalimidopropiophenone and N-ethylcathinone | journal = Forensic Science International | volume = 197 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 59–66 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20074881 | doi = 10.1016/j.forsciint.2009.12.048 }}</ref> and, along with [[mephedrone]], has also been reported as having been sold as "ecstasy" in the Australian city of [[Cairns]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120208133936/http://www.cairns.com.au/article/2 Killer pills hit Cairns]</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/06/17/2277735.htm Police warn of potentially fatal 'fake ecstasy']</ref>

== Pharmacology ==

The pharmacology for ethcathinone appeared alongside other psychostimulants in a paper by Rothman and Baumann in 2006.<ref name=Rothman>{{cite journal | last1 = Rothman | first1 = RB | last2 = Baumann | first2 = MH | title = Therapeutic potential of monoamine transporter substrates | journal = Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 6 | issue = 17 | pages = 1845–59 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17017961 | doi=10.2174/156802606778249766}}</ref> The predominant two modes of action for ethcathinone is as a moderately active [[releaser]] of [[noradrenaline]] (EC<sub>50</sub> = 99.3nM);<ref name=Rothman/> however it is only a relatively weak [[dopamine reuptake inhibitor|inhibitor of dopamine reuptake]] (K<sub>i</sub> = 1,014nM).<ref name=Rothman/>

Since diethylcathinone appears to be an inactive [[prodrug]] and only becomes active after it has been further metabolized to ethcathinone,<ref name=Rothman/> it thereby would appear rational to consider that ethcathinone would also be expected to be ''N''-[[dealkylated]] upon its consumption to the more active drug [[cathinone]] that is more able to reliably stimulate the release of [[dopamine]]. However, in contrast to diethylcathinone, ethcathinone is not universally considered to be a prodrug since (as is the case with (tramadol, codeine, and MDMA) it is already active in its own right, therefore being excluded from the category by some of the more strict definitions.

== Legal status ==
Ethcathinone, along with [[mephedrone]] and [[flephedrone]], was banned in [[Denmark]] on December 18, 2008.

As of October 2015 Ethcathinone is a controlled substance in China.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sfda.gov.cn/WS01/CL0056/130753.html | title=关于印发《非药用类麻醉药品和精神药品列管办法》的通知 | publisher=China Food and Drug Administration | date=27 September 2015 | language=Chinese | accessdate=1 October 2015}}</ref>

Ethyl cathinone is listed as a Schedule I Controlled Substance by the USDEA based on it being a positional isomer of mephedrone.<ref>DEA Controlled Substances Act listing dated 21-Jul-15</ref>
