'''Sorafenib''' (co-developed and co-marketed by [[Bayer]] and [[Onyx Pharmaceuticals]] as '''Nexavar'''),<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2007/ucm109030.htm |title=FDA Approves Nexavar for Patients with Inoperable Liver Cancer |publisher=FDA |date=November 19, 2007 |accessdate=November 10, 2012}}</ref> is a [[kinase]] inhibitor drug approved for the treatment of primary kidney cancer (advanced [[renal cell carcinoma]]), advanced primary liver cancer ([[hepatocellular carcinoma]]), and radioactive iodine resistant advanced thyroid carcinoma.

==Mechanism of action==
Sorafenib is a [[tyrosine kinase inhibitor|small inhibitor]] of several [[protein kinase|tyrosine protein kinase]]s, such as [[VEGFR]], [[PDGFR]] and [[Raf kinase|Raf family kinase]]s (more avidly [[C-Raf]] than [[B-raf 1|B-Raf]]).<ref name="pmid18794803">{{cite journal | vauthors = Smalley KS, Xiao M, Villanueva J, Nguyen TK, Flaherty KT, Letrero R, Van Belle P, Elder DE, Wang Y, Nathanson KL, Herlyn M | title = CRAF inhibition induces apoptosis in melanoma cells with non-V600E BRAF mutations | journal = Oncogene | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 85–94 |date=January 2009 | pmid = 18794803 | pmc = 2898184 | doi = 10.1038/onc.2008.362 }}</ref><ref name="pmid18852116">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilhelm SM, Adnane L, Newell P, Villanueva A, Llovet JM, Lynch M | title = Preclinical overview of sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor that targets both Raf and VEGF and PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase signaling | journal = Mol.

===Kidney cancer===
Clinical trial results, published January 2007, showed that, compared with placebo, treatment with sorafenib prolongs [[progression-free survival]] in patients with advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma in whom previous therapy has failed. The median progression-free survival was 5.5 months in the sorafenib group and 2.8 months in the placebo group ([[hazard ratio]] for disease progression in the sorafenib group, 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35 to 0.55; P<0.01).<ref name="pmid17215530">{{cite journal|author1 = Escudier, B|author2 = Eisen, T |author3 = Stadler, WM |author4 = Szczylik, C |author5 = Oudard, S |author6 = Siebels, M |author7 = Negrier, S |author8 =  Chevreau, C |author9 =  Solska, E |author10 =  Desai, AA |author11 =  Rolland, F |author12 =  Demkow, T |author13 =  Hutson, TE |author14 =  Gore, M |author15 =  Freeman, S |author16 =  Schwartz, B |author17 =  Shan, M |author18 =  Simantov, R |author19 =  Bukowski, RM | title = Sorafenib in advanced clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 356 | issue = 2 | pages = 125–34 |date=January 2007 | pmid = 17215530 |doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa060655 }}</ref> 

A few reports described patients with stage IV renal cell carcinomas, metastasized to the brain, that were successfully treated with a multimodal approach including neurosurgical, radiation, and sorafenib.<ref name="pmid19911072">{{cite journal | author1 = Walid, MS |author2 = Johnston, KW | title = Successful treatment of a brain-metastasized renal cell carcinoma | journal = German Medical Science | volume = 7 | issue =|pages = Doc28 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19911072 | pmc = 2775194| doi = 10.3205/000087 |url=http://www.egms.de/static/pdf/journals/gms/2009-7/000087.pdf}}</ref> 

In Australia this is one of two [[Therapeutic Goods Administration|TGA]]-labelled indications for sorafenib, although it is not listed on the [[Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme]] for this indication.<ref name = TGA/><ref name = PBS/>

===Liver cancer===
At [[American Society of Clinical Oncology|ASCO]] 2007, results from the SHARP trial<ref name=Llovet2008>{{cite journal | author = Llovet| title = Sorafenib in Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 359 | issue=4 | pages = 378–90 |year = 2008|url = http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa0708857|format=PDF | doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0708857 | pmid=18650514|display-authors=etal}}</ref> were presented, which showed efficacy of sorafenib in [[hepatocellular carcinoma]]. The primary endpoint was median [[overall survival]], which showed a 44% improvement in patients who received sorafenib compared to placebo ([[hazard ratio]] 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.87; p=0.0001). Both median survival and [[time to progression]] showed 3-month improvements. There was no difference in quality of life measures, possibly attributable to toxicity of sorafenib or symptoms related to underlying progression of liver disease. Of note, this trial only included patients with [[cirrhosis#Grading|Child-Pugh Class A (i.e. mildest) cirrhosis]].<ref name=Llovet2008/> Because of this trial Sorafenib obtained FDA approval for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in November 2007.<ref name=Keeting2009/>

In a randomized, double-blind, phase II trial combining sorafenib with [[doxorubicin]], the median [[time to progression]] was not significantly delayed compared with doxorubicin alone in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Median durations of overall survival and [[progression-free survival]] were significantly longer in patients receiving sorafenib plus doxorubicin than in those receiving doxorubicin alone.<ref name=Keeting2009>{{cite journal | vauthors = Keating GM, Santoro A | title = Sorafenib: a review of its use in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma | journal = Drugs | volume = 69 | issue = 2 | pages = 223–40 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19228077|doi = 10.2165/00003495-200969020-00006 }}</ref> 

A prospective single-centre phase II study which included the patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)concluding that the combination of sorafenib and [[drug-eluting beads|DEB]]-[[Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization|TACE]] in patients with unresectable HCC is well tolerated and safe, with most toxicities related to sorafenib.<ref name="pmid21911714">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pawlik TM, Reyes DK, Cosgrove D, Kamel IR, Bhagat N, Geschwind JF | title = Phase II trial of sorafenib combined with concurrent transarterial chemoembolization with drug-eluting beads for hepatocellular carcinoma| journal = J.

In Australia this is the only indication for which sorafenib is listed on the [[Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme|PBS]] and hence the only Government-subsidised indication for sorafenib.<ref name = PBS>{{cite web|title=Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) -SORAFENIB|work=Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme|publisher=Australian Government Department of Health|accessdate=27 December 2013|url=http://www.pbs.gov.au/medicine/item/9380Q}}</ref> Along with renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the [[Therapeutic Goods Administration|TGA]]-labelled indications for sorafenib.<ref name = TGA/>

===Thyroid cancer===
On November 22, 2013, sorafenib was approved by the FDA for the treatment of locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) refractory to radioactive iodine treatment.<ref name=FDA-2013-11/>

The Phase 3 DECISION trial showed significant improvement in progression-free survival but not in overall survival. However, as is known, the side effects were very frequent, specially hand and foot skin reaction.<ref>[http://www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCoverage/ASCO/39545 ASCO: Sorafenib Halts Resistant Thyroid Cancer. June 2013]</ref>

===Desmoid tumors===
A phase 3 clinical trial is under way testing the effectiveness of Sorafenib to treat desmoid tumors (also known as '''[[aggressive fibromatosis]]'''), after positive results in the first two trial stages. Dosage is typically half of that applied for malignant cancers (400&nbsp;mg vs 800&nbsp;mg). NCI are sponsoring this trial.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sorafenib Tosylate in Treating Patients With Desmoid Tumors or Aggressive Fibromatosis|url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02066181|website=Clinicaltrials.gov}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gounder|first1=MM|last2=Lefkowitz|first2=RA|last3=Keohan|first3=ML|last4=D'Adamo|first4=DR|last5=Hameed|first5=M|last6=Antonescu|first6=CR|last7=Singer|first7=S|last8=Stout|first8=K|last9=Ahn|first9=L|last10=Maki|first10=RG|title=Activity of Sorafenib against desmoid tumor/deep fibromatosis.|journal=Clinical Cancer Research|date=15 June 2011|volume=17|issue=12|pages=4082–90|pmid=21447727|doi=10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-10-3322|pmc=3152981}}</ref>

==History==

===Renal cancer===
Sorafenib was approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in December 2005,<ref name=FDAapproval1>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2005/021923ltr.pdf FDA Approval letter for use of sorafenib in advanced renal cancer]</ref> and received [[European Commission]] marketing authorization in July 2006,<ref name=EUapproval>[[European Commission]]&nbsp;– Enterprise and industry.

===Liver cancer===
The European Commission granted marketing authorization to the drug for the treatment of patients with [[hepatocellular carcinoma]](HCC), the most common form of liver cancer, in October 2007,<ref name=Euapproval>{{cite press release |title=Nexavar® (Sorafenib) Approved for Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Europe|url=http://www.pslgroup.com/news/content.nsf/medicalnews/852571020057CCF685257384005A45B1?OpenDocument&id=&count=10 |publisher=Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals and Onyx Pharmaceuticals |date=October 30, 2007|accessdate=November 10, 2012}}</ref> and FDA approval for this indication followed in November 2007.<ref name=FDAapproval2>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2007/021923s004,s005,s006,s007.pdf FDA Approval letter for use of sorafenib in inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma]</ref>

In November 2009, the UK's [[National Institute of Clinical Excellence]] declined to approve the drug for use within the [[National Health Service|NHS]] in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, stating that its effectiveness (increasing survival in primary liver cancer by 6 months) did not justify its high price, at up to £3000 per patient per month.<ref name=bbc1>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8367614.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Liver drug 'too expensive' |date=November 19, 2009|accessdate=November 10, 2012}}</ref> In Scotland the drug had already been refused authorization by the [[Scottish Medicines Consortium]] for use within [[NHS Scotland]], for the same reason.<ref name=bbc1/>

In March 2012, the Indian Patent Office granted a domestic company, [http://www.natcopharma.co.in/ Natco Pharma], a license to manufacture generic Sorafenib, bringing its price down by 97%.

==Research==

===Lung===
In some kinds of lung cancer (with squamous-cell histology) sorafenib administered in addition to [[paclitaxel]] and [[carboplatin]] may be ''detrimental'' to patients.<ref>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/573511 "Addition of Sorafenib May Be Detrimental in Some Lung Cancer Patients"]</ref>

===Brain (recurrent glioblastoma)===
There is a phase I/II study at the Mayo Clinic<ref name="Mayo">{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00329719|Sorafenib and Temsirolimus in Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma}}</ref> of sorafenib and CCI-779 ([[temsirolimus]]) for recurrent [[glioblastoma]]. <!-- too much detail : that can be given without causing unacceptable side effects, to determine what effects sorafenib and CCI-779 have on a patient and the brain tumor, to compare patient's response to sorafenib and CCI-779 with laboratory studies of a patient's blood cells and tumor tissues, and to study if the combination will be able to slow the growth of a tumor.-->

===Desmoid tumor (aggressive fibromatosis)===
A study performed in 2011 showed that Sorafenib is active against [[aggressive fibromatosis]].

==Nexavar controversy==

In January 2014, Bayer's CEO stated that Nexavar was developed for "western patients who [could] afford it".  At the prevailing prices, a kidney cancer patient would pay $96,000 (£58,000) for a year's course of the Bayer-made drug. However, the cost of the Indian version of the [[generic drug]] would be around $2,800 (£1,700).<ref>{{cite news|title='We didn't make this medicine for Indians… we made it for western patients who can afford it'|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2545360/Pharmaceutical-chief-tries-stop-India-replicating-cancer-treatment.html|newspaper=Daily Mail Reporter|date=24 Jan 2014}}</ref>
