==Medical uses==
It is first-line therapy for [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]] (''Rickettsia''), [[Lyme disease]] (''B. burgdorferi''), [[Q fever]] (''Coxiella''), [[psittacosis]],  [[lymphogranuloma venereum]] (''Chlamydia''), and ''Mycoplasma pneumoniae'' and to eradicate nasal carriage of [[Neisseria meningitidis|meningococci]]. Tetracycline tablets were used in the plague outbreak in India in 1994.<ref>Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews: Pharmacology, 4th ed. Harvery RA, Champe, PC. Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, 2009</ref>

=== Spectrum of bacterial susceptibility ===
Tetracyclines have a broad spectrum of antibiotic action. Originally, they possessed some level of bacteriostatic activity against almost all medically relevant aerobic and anaerobic bacterial genera, both [[Gram-positive bacteria|Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]], with a few exceptions, such as ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' and [[Proteus (bacterium)|''Proteus'' spp.]], which display intrinsic resistance. However, acquired (as opposed to inherent) resistance has proliferated in many pathogenic organisms and greatly eroded the formerly vast versatility of this group of antibiotics. Resistance amongst ''Staphylococcus'' spp., ''Streptococcus'' spp., ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'', anaerobes, members of the Enterobacteriaceae, and several other previously sensitive organisms is now quite common. Tetracyclines remain especially useful in the management of infections by certain obligately intracellular bacterial pathogens such as ''[[Chlamydia (genus)|Chlamydia]]'', ''[[Mycoplasma]]'', and ''[[Rickettsia]]''. They are also of value in spirochaetal infections, such as [[syphilis]], [[leptospirosis]], and [[Lyme disease]]. Certain rare or exotic infections, including [[anthrax]], [[Plague (disease)|plague]] and [[brucellosis]], are also susceptible to tetracyclines. These agents also have activity against certain eukaryotic parasites, including those responsible for diseases such as [[malaria]] and [[balantidiasis]]. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant microorganisms:
* ''Escherichia coli:'' 1 μg/mL — >128 μg/mL
* ''Shigella'' spp.: 1 μg/mL — 128 μg/mL<ref>http://www.toku-e.com/Assets/MIC/Tetracycline%20hydrochloride.pdf</ref>

===Mechanisms of resistance===
Bacteria usually acquire resistance to tetracycline from [[horizontal gene transfer|horizontal transfer]] of a gene that either encodes an [[efflux pump]] or a [[ribosomal protection protein]]. Efflux pumps actively eject tetracycline from the cell, preventing the buildup of an inhibitory concentration of tetracycline in the [[cytoplasm]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chopra I, Roberts M |title=Tetracycline Antibiotics: Mode of Action, Applications, Molecular Biology, and Epidemiology of Bacterial Resistance |journal=Microbiol.

Short-term use is safe; bioavailability in milk is low to nil.<ref>Riordan, Jan."Breastfeeding & Human Lactation", Jones & Bartlett,2010 p.179</ref> According to the U.S. FDA,  cases of [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]], [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]], and [[erythema multiforme]] associated with doxycyline use have been reported, but a causative role has not been established.<ref name=AERSlist>[http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/ucm223734.htm FDA Adverse Events Reporting System] Retrieved on January 14, 2011</ref>

Since tetracycline is absorbed into bone, it is used as a marker of bone growth for [[biopsies]] in humans. Tetracycline labeling is used to determine the amount of bone growth within a certain period of time, usually a period around 21 days. Tetracycline is incorporated into mineralizing bone and can be detected by its [[fluorescence]].<ref name=mayton>Mayton CA. [http://www.histosearch.com/histonet/Dec02/TetracyclinelabelingofbonA.html Tetracycline labeling of bone]</ref> In "double tetracycline labeling", a second dose is given 11–14 days after the first dose, and the amount of bone formed during that interval can be calculated by measuring the distance between the two fluorescent labels.<ref>[http://pathology2.jhu.edu/bonelab/4cycline.htm The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions. > Tetracycline Labeling] Last updated January 8, 2001.</ref>

A technique being developed for the control of the mosquito species ''[[Aedes aegypti]]'' uses a strain that is [[genetically modified]] to require tetracycline to develop beyond the larval stage. Modified males raised in a laboratory develop normally as they are supplied with this chemical and can be released into the wild. Their subsequent offspring inherit this trait, but find no tetracycline in their environments, so never develop into adults.<ref>{{cite news| author= Conal Urquhart| title= Can GM mosquitoes rid the world of a major killer?| publisher= ''The Observer''| date= 15 July 2012| url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/15/gm-mosquitoes-dengue-fever-feature| accessdate= 2012-07-15}}</ref>

==Cell culture==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
Tetracycline is used in cell biology as a selective agent in cell culture systems. It is toxic to prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and selects for cells harboring the bacterial ''tet <sup>r</sup>'' gene, which encodes a 399-amino-acid, membrane-associated protein. This protein actively exports tetracycline from the cell, rendering cells harboring this gene more resistant to the drug.
The yellow crystalline powder can be dissolved in water or ethanol and diluted to its final concentration in cell culture, where it has a half-life around 24 hours.

==Mechanism of action==
Tetracycline inhibits protein synthesis by blocking the attachment of charged aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site on the ribosome. Tetracycline binds to the 30S subunit of microbial ribosomes. Thus, it prevents introduction of new amino acids to the nascent peptide chain.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mehta |first=Akul |url=http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2011/05/mechanism-of-action-of-tetracyclines/ |title=Mechanism of Action of Tetracyclines |publisher=Pharmaxchange.info |date=2011-05-27 |accessdate=2012-06-07}}</ref> The action is usually inhibitory and reversible upon withdrawal of the drug. Mammalian cells are less vulnerable to the effect of tetracyclines, despite the fact that tetracycline binds to the small ribosomal subunit of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (30S and 40S, respectively). This is because bacteria actively pump tetracycline into their cytoplasm, even against a concentration gradient, whereas mammalian cells do not. This accounts for the relatively small off-site effect of tetracycline on human cells.<ref>Kenneth Todar, Antimicrobial Agents in the Treatment of Infectious Disease. Online Textbook of Bacteriology. 2012. http://textbookofbacteriology.net/antimicrobial_4.html</ref>

== History ==
The tetracyclines, a large family of antibiotics, were discovered as natural products by [[Benjamin Minge Duggar]] in 1945 and first prescribed in 1948.<ref>Klajn, Rafal, [http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/tetracycline/tetracycline.htm Chemistry and chemical biology of tetracyclines], retrieved 20 June 2007.{{better source|date=March 2017}}</ref> Benjamin Duggar, working under [[Yellapragada Subbarow]] at [[American Cyanamid|Lederle Laboratories]], discovered the first tetracycline antibiotic, [[chlortetracycline]] (Aureomycin),  in 1945.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Jukes, Thomas H. | date = 1985 | title =  Some Historical Notes on Chlortetracycline | journal = Reviews of Infectious Diseases | volume=7 | issue=5; Sep.-Oct. | location = Washington, DC | publisher =  | jstor=4453725 | pages = 702–707 | doi =  | url = http://www.jstor.org/stable/4453725 | access-date = March 13, 2017 | registration = yes | quote =  }}</ref>

Pfizer was of the view that it deserved the right to a patent on tetracycline and filed its Conover application in October 1952. Cyanamid filed its [[Boothe-Morton]] application for similar rights in March 1953, while Heyden Chemicals filed its Minieri application in September 1953, named after scientist [[P.

===Names===
It is marketed under the brand names Sumycin, Tetracyn, Lymecycline, and Panmycin, among others. Actisite is a thread-like fiber formulation used in dental applications.

It is also used to produce several semisynthetic derivatives, which together are known as the [[tetracycline antibiotics]]. The term "tetracycline" is also used to denote the four-ring system of this compound; "tetracyclines" are related substances that contain the same four-ring system.
