==Medical uses==
Spironolactone is used primarily to treat [[heart failure]], [[edema]]tous conditions such as [[nephrotic syndrome]] or [[ascites]] in people with [[liver disease]], essential [[hypertension]], [[hypokalemia]], [[secondary hyperaldosteronism]] (such as occurs with [[hepatic cirrhosis]]), and [[Conn's syndrome]] (primary hyperaldosteronism). On its own, spironolactone is only a weak diuretic because it primarily targets the [[distal nephron]] ([[collecting duct system|collecting tubule]]), where only small amounts of [[sodium]] are reabsorbed, but it can be combined with other diuretics to increase efficacy.

Spironolactone directly blocks androgen signaling and also acts as an [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] of [[androgen]] [[biosynthesis|production]]. Due to the antiandrogenic effects that result from these actions, it is frequently used off-label to treat a variety of [[dermatological condition]]s in which androgens, such as [[testosterone]] and [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT), play a role. Some of these uses include [[androgenic alopecia]] in men (either at low doses or as a [[topical]] [[pharmaceutical formulation|formulation]]) and women, and [[hirsutism]] (excessive hair growth), [[acne]], and [[seborrhea]] in women.<ref name="pmid2969259">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hughes BR, Cunliffe WJ | title = Tolerance of spironolactone | journal = The British Journal of Dermatology | volume = 118 | issue = 5 | pages = 687–91 |date=May 1988 | pmid = 2969259 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2133.1988.tb02571.x| url = }}</ref> Spironolactone is the most commonly used drug in the treatment of hirsutism in the [[United States]].<ref name="Preedy2012">{{cite book|author=Victor R.

===High blood pressure===
About one person in one hundred with hypertension has elevated levels of aldosterone; in these people, the antihypertensive effect of spironolactone may exceed that of complex combined regimens of other antihypertensives since it targets the primary cause of the elevated blood pressure. However, a Cochrane review found adverse effects at high doses and little effect on blood pressure at low doses in the majority of people with high blood pressure.<ref name=Bat2010>{{cite journal|last1=Batterink|first1=J|last2=Stabler|first2=SN|last3=Tejani|first3=AM|last4=Fowkes|first4=CT|title=Spironolactone for hypertension.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=4 August 2010|issue=8|pages=CD008169|pmid=20687095|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008169.pub2}}</ref> There is no evidence of person-oriented outcome at any dose in this group.<ref name=Bat2010/>

===Heart failure===
While [[loop diuretics]] remain first-line for most people with [[heart failure]], spironolactone has shown to reduce both morbidity and mortality in numerous studies and remains an important agent for treating fluid retention, edema, and symptoms of heart failure. Current recommendations from the [[American Heart Association]] are to use spironolactone in patients with NYHA Class II-IV heart failure who have a left ventricular [[ejection fraction]] of <35%.<ref name="Yancy e147-239">{{cite journal|vauthors=Yancy CW, Jessup M, Bozkurt B, Butler J, Casey DE, Drazner MH, Fonarow GC, Geraci SA, Horwich T, Januzzi JL, Johnson MR, Kasper EK, Levy WC, Masoudi FA, McBride PE, McMurray JJ, Mitchell JE, Peterson PN, Riegel B, Sam F, Stevenson LW, Tang WH, Tsai EJ, Wilkoff BL,(( American College of Cardiology, Foundation; American Heart Association Task Force on Practice, Guidelines))|title=2013 ACCF/AHA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines.|journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology|date=Oct 15, 2013|volume=62|issue=16|pages=e147–239|pmid=23747642|doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2013.05.019}}</ref>

In a [[clinical trial|randomized evaluation]] which studied people with severe [[Heart failure|congestive heart failure]], people treated with spironolactone were found to have a [[relative risk]] of death of 0.70 or an overall 30% [[relative risk reduction]] compared to the [[placebo]] group, indicating a significant [[death]] and [[morbidity]] benefit of the drug. Patients in the study's intervention arm also had fewer symptoms of [[heart failure]] and were hospitalized less frequently.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pitt B, Zannad F, Remme W, Cody R, Castaigne A, Perez A, Palensky J, Wittes J | title = The effect of spironolactone on morbidity and mortality in patients with severe heart failure.

It is recommended that alternatives to spironolactone be considered if serum [[creatinine]] is >2.5&nbsp;mg/dL (221µmol/L) in males or >2&nbsp;mg/dL (176.8 µmol/L) in females, if [[glomerular filtration rate]] is below 30mL/min or with a serum potassium of >5.0 mEq/L given the potential for adverse events detailed elsewhere in this article. Doses should be adjusted according to the degree of renal function as well.<ref name="Yancy e147-239"/>

According to [[systematic review]], in [[heart failure]] with preserved [[ejection fraction]], treatment with spironolactone did not improve patient outcomes. This is based on the TOPCAT Trial examining this issue, which found that of those treated with placebo had a 20.4% incidence of negative outcome vs 18.6% incidence of negative outcome with spironolactone. However, because the [[p-value]] of the study was 0.14, and the unadjusted [[hazard ratio]] was 0.89 with a 95% [[confidence interval]] of 0.77 to 1.04, it is determined the finding had no [[statistical significance]]. Hence the finding that patient outcomes are not improved with use of spironolactone.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Pitt B. et. al. | title = Spironolactone for Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 370 | issue = 15 | pages = 1383–1392 | year = 2014 | url= http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/370/15/709 | pmid = 24716680 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1313731}}</ref> More recently, when blood samples from 366 patients in the TOPCAT study were analyzed for presence of [[canrenone]] (an active metabolite of spironolactone), 30% of blood samples from [[Russia]] lacked detectable residues of canrenone.

Due to its antiandrogen properties, spironolactone can cause effects associated with low androgen levels and [[hypogonadism]] in males. For this reason, men are typically not prescribed spironolactone for any longer than a short period of time, e.g., for an acute exacerbation of heart failure. A newer drug, [[eplerenone]], has been approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] for the treatment of heart failure, and lacks the antiandrogen effects of spironolactone. As such, it is far more suitable for men for whom long-term medication is being chosen. However, eplerenone may not be as effective as spironolactone or the related drug [[canrenone]] in reducing mortality from heart failure.<ref name="pmid22840667">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chatterjee S, Moeller C, Shah N, Bolorunduro O, Lichstein E, Moskovits N, Mukherjee D | title = Eplerenone is not superior to older and less expensive aldosterone antagonists | journal = Am.

The clinical benefits of spironolactone as a diuretic are typically not seen until 2–3 days after dosing begins. Likewise, the maximal antihypertensive effect may not be seen for 2–3 weeks.

Unlike with some other diuretics, potassium supplementation should ''not'' be administered while taking spironolactone, as this may cause dangerous elevations in serum potassium levels resulting in [[hyperkalemia]] and potentially deadly abnormal heart rhythms.

===Skin and hair conditions===
Androgens like testosterone and DHT play a critical role in the [[pathogenesis]] of a number of [[cutaneous condition|dermatological conditions]] including [[acne]], [[seborrhea]], [[hirsutism]] (excessive facial/body hair growth in women), and [[pattern hair loss]] (androgenic alopecia).<ref name="pmid15507105">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zouboulis CC, Degitz K | title = Androgen action on human skin -- from basic research to clinical significance | journal = Exp.

Antiandrogens like spironolactone are male-specific [[teratogen]]s which can feminize male [[fetus]]es due to their antiandrogen effects (see [[Spironolactone#Pregnancy and breastfeeding|below]]).<ref name="pmid9420861" /><ref name="IswaranImai1997">{{cite journal | vauthors = Iswaran TJ, Imai M, Betton GR, Siddall RA | title = An overview of animal toxicology studies with bicalutamide (ICI 176,334) | journal = The Journal of Toxicological Sciences | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 75–88 | date = May 1997 | pmid = 9198005 | doi = 10.2131/jts.22.2_75 }}</ref><ref name="Smith2013">{{cite book |first1=Robert E. |last1=Smith |name-list-format=vanc |title=Medicinal Chemistry – Fusion of Traditional and Western Medicine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RkDcAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA306 |date=4 April 2013 |publisher=Bentham Science Publishers |isbn=978-1-60805-149-6 |pages=306– |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529034219/https://books.google.com/books?id=RkDcAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA306 |archivedate=29 May 2016 |df= }}</ref> For this reason, it is recommended that antiandrogens only be used to treat women who are of reproductive age in conjunction with adequate contraception.<ref name="pmid9420861" /><ref name="IswaranImai1997" /><ref name="Smith2013" /> Oral contraceptives, which contain an estrogen and a progestin, are typically used for this purpose.<ref name="pmid9420861" /> Moreover, oral contraceptives themselves are functional antiandrogens and are independently effective in the treatment of androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions, and hence can significantly augment the effectiveness of antiandrogens in the treatment of such conditions.<ref name="pmid9420861" /><ref name="Ostrzenski2002">{{cite book|author=Adam Ostrzenski|title=Gynecology: Integrating Conventional, Complementary, and Natural Alternative Therapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TYlZsGdwqrQC&pg=PA86|year=2002|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-2761-7|pages=86–}}</ref>

Spironolactone is not generally used in men for the treatment of androgen-dependent dermatological conditions because of its feminizing side effects, but it is effective for such indications in men similarly.<ref name="pmid21413648" /> This is evidenced by the usefulness of spironolactone as an antiandrogen in transgender women.<ref name="WPATH2011" /><ref name="pmid19509099" /><ref name="pmid2540730" />

===Transgender hormone therapy===
Spironolactone is frequently used as a component of [[hormone replacement therapy (male-to-female)|hormone replacement therapy]] in [[transgender women]], especially in the [[United States]] (where [[cyproterone acetate]] is not available), usually in addition to an [[estrogen]].<ref name="WPATH2011">{{cite web | url = http://www.wpath.org/documents/Standards%20of%20Care_FullBook_1g-1.pdf | title = Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People | author = The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) | year = 2011 | format = PDF | accessdate = 2012-05-27 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120523064935/http://www.wpath.org/documents/Standards%20of%20Care_FullBook_1g-1.pdf | archivedate = 2012-05-23 | df =  }}</ref><ref name="pmid19509099">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Hembree WC, Cohen-Kettenis P, Delemarre-van de Waal HA, etal | title = Endocrine treatment of transsexual persons: an Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 94 | issue = 9 | pages = 3132–54 |date=September 2009 | pmid = 19509099 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2009-0345 | url = http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=19509099}}</ref><ref name="pmid2540730">{{cite journal |vauthors=Prior JC, Vigna YM, Watson D | title = Spironolactone with physiological female steroids for presurgical therapy of male-to-female transsexualism | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–57 |date=February 1989 | pmid = 2540730 | doi = 10.1007/bf01579291| url = }}</ref> Spironolactone significantly depresses plasma testosterone levels, reducing them to female/castrate levels at sufficient doses and in combination with estrogen.

===Comparison with other antiandrogens===
There are few available options for antiandrogen therapy.

The most important potential side effect of spironolactone is [[hyperkalemia]] (high [[potassium]] levels), which, in severe cases, can be life-threatening. Hyperkalemia in these patients can present as a non anion-gap metabolic acidosis. Spironolactone may put patients at a heightened risk for gastrointestinal issues like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cramping, and [[gastritis]]. In addition, there has been some evidence suggesting an association between use of the drug and [[hemorrhage|bleeding]] from the [[stomach]] and [[duodenum]], though a causal relationship between the two has not been established.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Spironolactone and risk of upper gastrointestinal events: population based case-control study | journal=Br Med J | year=2006  |vauthors=Verhamme K, Mosis G, Dieleman JP, etal | volume=333 | issue=7563 | pages=330&ndash;3 | doi=10.1136/bmj.38883.479549.2F | pmid=16840442 | pmc=1539051 }}</ref> Also, spironolactone has been shown to be [[immunosuppression|immunosuppressive]] in the treatment of [[sarcoidosis]].<ref>{{cite journal | title = Aldactone in the treatment of sarcoidosis of the lungs | journal=JZ Erkr Atmungsorgane. | year=1977 | author=Wandelt-Freerksen E. | volume=149 | pages=156–9 | pmid = 607621 | issue = 1}}</ref>

==Interactions==
Spironolactone often increases serum [[potassium]] levels and can cause [[hyperkalemia]], a very serious condition. Therefore, it is recommended that people using this drug avoid potassium supplements and salt substitutes containing potassium.<ref>{{cite web | title = Advisory Statement | publisher = Klinge Chemicals / LoSalt | url = http://www.losalt.com/docs/lo_salt_web_advice.pdf | format = pdf | accessdate = 2007-03-15 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061115185827/http://www.losalt.com/docs/lo_salt_web_advice.pdf | archivedate = 2006-11-15 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}</ref> Physicians must be careful to monitor potassium levels in both males and females who are taking spironolactone as a diuretic, especially during the first twelve months of use and whenever the dosage is increased. Doctors may also recommend that some patients may be advised to limit dietary consumption of potassium-rich foods. However, recent data suggests that both potassium monitoring and dietary restriction of potassium intake is unnecessary in healthy young women taking spironolactone for acne.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Plovanich M, Weng QY, Mostaghimi A | title = Low Usefulness of Potassium Monitoring Among Healthy Young Women Taking Spironolactone for Acne | journal = JAMA Dermatology | year = 2015 | url = http://archderm.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2194951 | pmid = 25796182 | doi = 10.1001/jamadermatol.2015.34 | volume = 151 | pages = 941–4 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150330174430/http://archderm.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2194951 | archivedate = 2015-03-30 | df =  }}</ref>

Research has suggested that spironolactone may be able to interfere with the effectiveness of [[antidepressant]] treatment. As the drug acts as an antimineralocorticoid, it is thought that it may reduce the effectiveness of certain antidepressants by interfering with normalization of the [[hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis]] and increasing glucocorticoid levels.<ref>Holsboer, F.

Although spironolactone is known to possess the above activities, it should be noted that the drug is a [[prodrug]], with [[active metabolite]]s such as [[7α-thiomethylspironolactone]] (7α-TMS) and [[canrenone]] being responsible for its clinical effects. For this reason, the actual ''in vivo'' clinical profile of spironolactone may differ from the activities and effective and inhibitory concentrations described above and to the right. In any case, interaction with both the MR and AR have been observed for metabolites of spironolactone.<ref name="AgustiBourgeois2013" /><ref name="pmid263288" /> On the other hand, spironolactone itself has only very low affinity for the ER, suggesting that its metabolites may be responsible for this activity.<ref name="pmid7391714" /><ref name="pmid27072668" />

===Antimineralocorticoid activity===
Spironolactone inhibits the effects of [[mineralocorticoid]]s, namely, [[aldosterone]], by displacing them from MR in the [[cortical collecting duct]] of renal nephrons. This decreases the reabsorption of sodium and water while limiting the excretion of potassium (A K+ sparing diuretic). The drug has a slightly delayed [[onset of action]], and so it takes several days for diuresis to occur. This is because the MR is a [[nuclear receptor]] which works through regulating [[gene transcription]] and [[gene expression]], in this case, to decrease the production and expression of [[ENaC]] and [[ROMK]] electrolyte channels in the distal nephrons. In addition to direct antagonism of the MRs, the [[antimineralocorticoid]] effects of spironolactone may also in part be mediated by direct inactivation of [[steroid 11β-hydroxylase]] and [[aldosterone synthase]] (18-hydroxylase), enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of mineralocorticoids. If levels of mineralocorticoids are decreased then there are lower circulating levels to compete with spironolactone to influence gene expression as mentioned above.<ref name="pmid976190">{{cite journal |vauthors=Cheng SC, Suzuki K, Sadee W, Harding BW | title = Effects of spironolactone, canrenone and canrenoate-K on cytochrome P450, and 11beta- and 18-hydroxylation in bovine and human adrenal cortical mitochondria | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 99 | issue = 4 | pages = 1097–106 |date=October 1976 | pmid = 976190 | doi = 10.1210/endo-99-4-1097| url = http://endo.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=976190}}</ref> The [[onset of action]] of the antimineralocorticoid effects of spironolactone is relatively slow, with the peak effect sometimes occurring 48 hours or more after the first dose.<ref name="Sica2005" /><ref name="pmid18729003" />

===Antiandrogenic activity===
Spironolactone is a potent and direct antagonist of the AR, blocking androgens like testosterone from binding to and activating the receptor.<ref name="pmid166833">{{cite journal |vauthors=Corvol P, Michaud A, Menard J, Freifeld M, Mahoudeau J | title = Antiandrogenic effect of spirolactones: mechanism of action | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 97 | issue = 1 | pages = 52–8 |date=July 1975 | pmid = 166833 | doi = 10.1210/endo-97-1-52| url = http://endo.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=166833}}</ref><ref name="SeldinGiebisch1997" /> The AR antagonism of spironolactone mostly underlies its antiandrogen activity and is responsible for its therapeutic benefits in the treatment of [[androgen-dependent condition]]s like acne, hirsutism, and pattern hair loss and its usefulness in hormone therapy for transgender women.<ref name="pmid166833" /> In addition, the AR antagonism of spironolactone is involved in its feminizing side effects like gynecomastia in men.<ref name="pmid166833" />

Spironolactone, similarly to other [[steroidal antiandrogen]]s such as [[cyproterone acetate]], is actually not a pure, or ''[[silent antagonist|silent]]'', antagonist of the AR, but rather is a weak [[partial agonist]] with the capacity for both antagonistic and agonistic effects.<ref name="pmid2462135">{{cite journal |vauthors=Luthy IA, Begin DJ, Labrie F | title = Androgenic activity of synthetic progestins and spironolactone in androgen-sensitive mouse mammary carcinoma (Shionogi) cells in culture | journal = Journal of Steroid Biochemistry | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 845–52 |date=November 1988 | pmid = 2462135 | doi = 10.1016/0022-4731(88)90295-6| url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid10715537">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Térouanne B, Tahiri B, Georget V, etal | title = A stable prostatic bioluminescent cell line to investigate androgen and antiandrogen effects | journal = Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology | volume = 160 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 39–49 |date=February 2000 | pmid = 10715537 | doi = 10.1016/S0303-7207(99)00251-8| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0303-7207(99)00251-8}}</ref><ref name="FritzSperoff2010">{{cite book | author1 = Marc A.

====Steroidogenesis inhibition====
Spironolactone is able to significantly lower testosterone levels at high dosages in spite of not acting as an antigonadotropin, and this is thought to be due to direct enzymatic inhibition of 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, enzymes necessary for the biosynthesis of testosterone.<ref name="MelmedPolonsky2015">{{cite book| vauthors = Melmed S, Polonsky KS, Larsen PR, Kronenberg HM |title=Williams Textbook of Endocrinology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YZ8_CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA743|date=30 November 2015|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-323-29738-7|pages=743–}}</ref><ref name="Sengupta2007">{{cite book|author=Sengupta|title=Gynaecology For Postgraduate And Practitioners|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ELkWa34eBz4C&pg=PA172|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Elsevier India|isbn=978-81-312-0436-8|pages=172–}}</ref><ref name="CarrBlackwell1998">{{cite book|author1=Bruce R.

Spironolactone has been found not to have activity as an [[aromatase inhibitor]].<ref name="pmid10428369" /><ref name="pmid12477487" />

====Glucocorticoid activity====
Spironolactone has been shown to inhibit steroid 11β-hydroxylase, an enzyme that is essential for the production of the [[glucocorticoid]] hormone [[cortisol]]. Because of this, glucocorticoid levels might be expected to be lowered, and hence, spironolactone might have some [[antiglucocorticoid]]ic effects. In clinical practice, however, this has not been found to be the case; spironolactone has actually been found to increase [[cortisol]] levels, both with acute and chronic administration. Research has shown that this is due to antagonism of the MR, which suppresses [[negative feedback]] on the [[hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis|hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis]]. The HPA axis positively regulates the [[secretion]] of [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH), which in turn signals the [[adrenal gland]]s, the major source of [[corticosteroid]] biosynthesis in the body, to increase production of both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. Therefore, by antagonizing the MR, spironolactone causes an increase in ACTH secretion and by extension an indirect rise in cortisol levels.<ref name="pmid9745451">{{cite journal |vauthors=Young EA, Lopez JF, Murphy-Weinberg V, Watson SJ, Akil H | title = The role of mineralocorticoid receptors in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis regulation in humans | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 83 | issue = 9 | pages = 3339–45 |date=September 1998 | pmid = 9745451 | doi = 10.1210/jcem.83.9.5077| url = http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9745451}}</ref><ref name="pmid17035932">{{cite journal | vauthors = Otte C, Moritz S, Yassouridis A, etal | title = Blockade of the mineralocorticoid receptor in healthy men: effects on experimentally induced panic symptoms, stress hormones, and cognition | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 232–8 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17035932 | doi = 10.1038/sj.npp.1301217 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.npp.1301217 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081011132747/http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.npp.1301217 | archivedate = 2008-10-11 | df =  }}</ref> As such, any anti-glucocorticoid activity of spironolactone via direct suppression of glucocorticoid synthesis (at the level of the adrenals) appears to be more than fully offset by its concurrent indirect stimulatory effects on glucocorticoid production.
