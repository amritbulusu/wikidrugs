'''Edoxaban''' ('''DU-176b''', trade names '''Savaysa''', '''Lixiana''') is an oral [[anticoagulant]] drug which acts as a [[direct factor Xa inhibitor]]. It was developed by [[Daiichi Sankyo]] and approved in July 2011 in Japan for prevention of venous thromboembolisms (VTE) following lower-limb orthopedic surgery.<ref name="url_Daiichi_Sankyo_Europe_GmbH">{{cite web|url=http://www.daiichi-sankyo.eu/media/press-news-in-english/news-detail/article/first-market-approval-in-japan-for-lixianaR-edoxaban.html |title=First market approval in Japan for LIXIANA (Edoxaban) |date=2011-04-22 |work=Press Release |publisher=Daiichi Sankyo Europe GmbH |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106002948/http://www.daiichi-sankyo.eu/media/press-news-in-english/news-detail/article/first-market-approval-in-japan-for-lixianaR-edoxaban.html |archivedate=2013-11-06 |df= }}</ref> It was also approved by the [[FDA]] in January 2015 for the prevention of stroke and non–central-nervous-system systemic [[embolism]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/837837 | title=FDA Approves Edoxaban for Stroke Prevention in AF and DVT/PE Prevention | work=Medscape | date=9 January 2015 | accessdate=10 January 2015 | author=O'Riordan, Michael}}</ref>

== Medical uses ==
US [[FDA]]-labeled [[Indication (medicine)|indications]]:
:Treatment of [[deep vein thrombosis]] (DVT) and [[pulmonary embolism]] (PE) following 5 to 10 days of initial therapy with a parenteral anticoagulant.
:To reduce the risk of [[stroke]] and systemic [[embolism]] (SE) in patients with nonvalvular [[atrial fibrillation]] (NVAF)

== Contraindications ==
Edoxaban is contraindicated in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients with a [[creatinine clearance]] (CrCl) greater<!--sic--> than 95 mL/minute because of an increased risk of [[ischemic stroke]] compared to [[warfarin]].<ref>http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2015/206316lbl.pdf</ref>

It is also contraindicated in patients with active pathological bleeding.<ref name=PI />

== Warnings ==

Spinal or epidural [[hematomas]] resulting in long-term or permanent [[paralysis]] may occur with neuraxial [[anesthesia]] (epidural or spinal anesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture; the risk is increased by the use of indwelling [[epidural]] [[catheters]], concomitant administration of other drugs that affect [[hemostasis]] (e.g., NSAIDs, platelet inhibitors, other anticoagulants), in patients with a history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures, a history of spinal deformity or surgery, or if optimal timing between the administration of edoxaban and neuraxial procedures is not known.<ref name=lexicomp />

== Adverse effects ==

''More common''
*bloody nose
*heavy non-menstrual vaginal bleeding
*pale skin
*troubled breathing with exertion
*unusual bleeding or bruising
*unusual tiredness or weakness
''Less common''
*bloody or black, tarry stools
*vomiting of blood or material that looks like coffee grounds
*rash
''Rare''
*confusion
*cough
*difficulty with speaking
*double vision
*fever
*headache, sudden, severe
*inability to move the arms, legs, or facial muscles
*inability to speak
*nausea and vomiting
*slow speech<ref>http://www.drugs.com/cons/edoxaban.html</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==
Edoxaban inhibits free [[factor Xa]] and [[prothrombinase]] activity and inhibits thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Inhibition of factor Xa in the [[coagulation cascade]] reduces thrombin generation and thrombus formation.<ref name="lexicomp">lexicomp.com</ref><ref name="PI">Savaysa (edoxaban) [prescribing information]. Parsippany, NJ: Daiichi Sankyo; January 2015.</ref>

=== Factor Xa ===

Factor Xa (FXa) is an essential blood coagulation factor<ref>Yoshiyuki, I., et al. "Biochemical and pharmalogical profile of darexaban, an oral direct Xa inhibitor." European Journal of Pharmacology (2011): 49-55</ref> that is responsible for the initiation of the coagulation cascade. FXa cleaves [[prothrombin]] to its active form [[thrombin]], which then acts to convert soluble [[fibrinogen]] to insoluble [[fibrin]] and to activate [[platelet]]s. Stabilization of the platelet aggregation by fibrin mesh ultimately leads to clot formation.<ref name=Katsung>Katsung, B., S. Masters and A. Trevor. Basic and Clinical Pharmacology 11th Edition. United States of America: McGraw-Hill, 2009</ref>

== Related medications ==
A number of [[anticoagulants]] inhibit the activity of Factor Xa. Unfractionated [[heparin]] (UFH), [[low molecular weight heparin]] (LMWH), and [[fondaparinux]] inhibit the activity of factor Xa indirectly by binding to circulating [[antithrombin]] (AT III). These agents must be injected. [[Warfarin]], [[phenprocoumon]], and [[acenocoumarol]] are orally active [[vitamin K antagonist]]s (VKA) which decrease [[hepatic]] synthesis of a number of coagulation factors, including Factor X. In recent years, a new series of oral, direct acting inhibitors of Factor Xa have entered clinical development. These include [[rivaroxaban]], [[apixaban]], [[betrixaban]], LY517717, [[darexaban]] (YM150), and edoxaban (DU-176b).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Turpie AG |title=New oral anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation |journal=European Heart Journal |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=155–65 | date=January  2008 |pmid=18096568 |doi=10.1093/eurheartj/ehm575}}</ref>
