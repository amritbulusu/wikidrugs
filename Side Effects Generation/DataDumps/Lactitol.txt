'''Lactitol''' is a [[sugar alcohol]] used as a replacement bulk [[Sugar substitute|sweetener]] for low [[calorie]] [[foods]] with approximately 40% of the sweetness of [[sugar]].  It is also used medically as a [[laxative]].  Lactitol is produced by two manufacturers, [[Danisco]] and [[Purac Biochem]].

==Applications==
Lactitol is used in a variety of low [[food energy]] or [[low fat]] foods.  High stability makes it popular for [[baking]]. It is used in [[sugar-free]] [[candy|candies]], [[cookie|cookies (biscuits)]], [[chocolate]], and [[ice cream]].  Lactitol also promotes [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] health as a [[Prebiotic (nutrition)|prebiotic]].  Because of poor absorption, lactitol only has 2.4 [[Calorie]]s (9 [[kilojoule]]s) per [[gram]], compared to 4 Calories (17 kJ) per gram for typical [[carbohydrate]]s.

Lactitol is listed as an [[excipient]] in some prescription drugs, such as Adderall.<ref>[http://www.drugs.com/pro/adderall.html Adderall], drugs.com</ref>

Lactitol is a laxative and is used to prevent or treat [[constipation]], e.g., under the trade name Importal.<ref>[http://www.fass.se/LIF/produktfakta/artikel_produkt.jsp?NplID=19930305000024&DocTypeID=7&UserTypeID=2 FASS.se] (the Swedish Medicines Information Engine). Revised 2003-02-12.</ref>

Lactitol in combination with [[Ispaghula]] husk is an approved combination for [[idiopathic]] [[constipation]] as a laxative and is used to prevent or treat constipation.

==Safety and health==
Lactitol, [[erythritol]], [[sorbitol]], [[xylitol]], [[mannitol]], and [[maltitol]] are all sugar alcohols. The [[United States Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) classifies sugar alcohols as "[[generally recognized as safe]]" (GRAS). They are approved as food additives, and are recognized as not contributing to [[tooth decay]] or causing increases in [[blood glucose]]. Lactitol is also approved for use in foods in most countries around the world.

Like most other sugar alcohols (with the exception of [[erythritol]]), lactitol causes cramping, flatulence, and diarrhea in all individuals who consume it. This is because humans lack a suitable beta-galactosidase in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and a majority of ingested lactitol reaches the large intestine,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Grimble GK, Patil DH, Silk DB | year = 1988 | title = Assimilation of lactitol, an unabsorbed disaccharide in the normal human colon | journal = Gut | volume = 29 | pages = 1666–1671 | doi = 10.1136/gut.29.12.1666 | pmid = 3220306 | issue = 12 | pmc = 1434111}}</ref> where it then becomes fermentable to gut microbes (prebiotic) and can pull water into the gut by osmosis.   Those with health conditions should consult their GP or dietician prior to consumption.
