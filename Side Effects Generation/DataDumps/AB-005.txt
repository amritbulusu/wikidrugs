'''AB-005''' or '''[1-[(1-methyl-2-piperidinyl)methyl]-1''H''-indol-3-yl](2,2,3,3-tetramethylcyclopropyl)-methanone''' is a [[designer drug]] offered by online vendors as a cannabimimetic agent. The structure and pharmacological activity of AB-005 was published in 2010, prior to its commercial availability in 2012, where it was reported to have high affinity for both CB1 (''K''<sub>i</sub> = 5.5 nM) and CB2 receptors (''K''<sub>i</sub> = 0.48 nM).<ref>{{Cite journal |last1= Frost |first1= J.

</ref> AB-005 features groups found in other previously reported synthetic cannabinoids: the tetramethylcyclopropane group of [[UR-144]] and [[XLR-11 (drug)|XLR-11]] as well as the (1-methyl-2-piperidinyl)methyl substituent of [[AM-1248]] and [[AM-1220]]. No information regarding the in vivo activity of AB-005 has been published, and only anecdotal reports are known of its psychoactivity in humans.
