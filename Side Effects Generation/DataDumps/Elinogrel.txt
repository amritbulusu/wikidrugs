Similarly to [[ticagrelor]] and in contrast to [[clopidogrel]], elinogrel was a reversible inhibitor that acted fast and short (for about 12 hours), and it was not a [[prodrug]] but pharmacologically active itself. The substance was used in form of its [[potassium]] salt, [[intravenous]]ly for acute treatment and [[Oral administration|orally]] for long-term treatment.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Drugs Fut|title=Elinogrel potassium|last1=Gurbel|first1=P.A.|last2=Kereiakes|first2=D.|last3=Tantry|first3=U.S.|year=2010|volume=35|issue=11|page=885}}</ref> Development was terminated in 2012.
