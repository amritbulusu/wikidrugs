They are [[anabolic]] and increase [[protein]] within [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, especially in [[skeletal muscle]]s, and also have varying degrees of androgenic and [[virilization|virilizing]] effects, including induction of the development and maintenance of [[masculinity|masculine]] [[secondary sexual characteristic]]s such as the growth of the [[vocal fold|vocal cords]] and [[body hair]]. The word ''anabolic'', referring to [[anabolism]], comes from the Greek ἀναβολή ''anabole'', "that which is thrown up, mound." They are one of three types of sex hormone [[agonist]]s, the others being [[estrogen]]s like [[estradiol]] and [[progestogen]]s like [[progesterone]].

AAS were synthesized in the 1930s, and are now used therapeutically in medicine to stimulate muscle growth and [[appetite]], induce male [[puberty]] and treat chronic [[wasting]] conditions, such as [[cancer]] and {{abbrlink|AIDS|acquired immunodeficiency syndrome}}. The [[American College of Sports Medicine]] acknowledges that AAS, in the presence of adequate diet, can contribute to increases in [[body weight]], often as lean mass increases and that the gains in [[muscular strength]] achieved through high-intensity exercise and proper diet can be additionally increased by the use of AAS in some individuals.<ref>{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Powers |title=Performance-Enhancing Drugs |editor-first1=Joel |editor-last1=Houglum |editor-first2=Gary L. |editor-last2=Harrelson | name-list-format = vanc |work=Principles of Pharmacology for Athletic Trainers |publisher=SLACK Incorporated |date=2011 |edition=2nd |isbn=978-1-55642-901-9 |p=345 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wbkoeZuwqjwC&pg=PA345}}</ref>

Since the discovery and synthesis of testosterone in the 1930s, AAS have been used by physicians for many purposes, with varying degrees of success, including the following:

* [[Bone marrow]] stimulation: For decades, AAS were the mainstay of therapy for [[hypoplastic]] [[anemia]]s due to [[leukemia]] or [[kidney failure]], especially [[aplastic anemia]].<ref name=Basaria>{{cite journal |vauthors=Basaria S, Wahlstrom JT, Dobs AS |title=Clinical review 138: Anabolic-androgenic steroid therapy in the treatment of chronic diseases |journal=J.

Such use is prohibited by the rules of the governing bodies of most sports. AAS use occurs among adolescents, especially by those participating in competitive sports. It has been suggested that the prevalence of use among high-school students in the U.S. may be as high as 2.7%.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hickson RC, Czerwinski SM, Falduto MT, Young AP |title=Glucocorticoid antagonism by exercise and androgenic-anabolic steroids |journal=Medicine and science in sports and exercise |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=331–40 |year=1990 |pmid=2199753 |doi=10.1249/00005768-199006000-00010}}</ref> Male students used AAS more frequently than female students and, on average, those that participated in sports used steroids more often than those that did not.

===Available forms===
[[File:Depo-testosterone 200 mg ml.jpg|thumb|upright|A vial of injectable testosterone cypionate]]
There are four common forms in which AAS are administered: oral pills; injectable steroids; creams/gels for topical application; and skin patches. Oral administration is the most convenient. Testosterone administered by mouth is rapidly absorbed, but it is largely converted to inactive metabolites, and only about one-sixth is available in active form. In order to be sufficiently active when given by mouth, testosterone derivatives are alkylated at the 17α position, e.g. [[methyltestosterone]] and [[fluoxymesterone]]. This modification reduces the liver's ability to break down these compounds before they reach the systemic circulation.

Testosterone can be administered [[Parenteral medication|parenterally]], but it has more irregular prolonged absorption time and greater activity in muscle in [[enanthate]], [[undecanoate]], or [[cypionate]] [[ester]] form. These derivatives are hydrolyzed to release free testosterone at the site of injection; absorption rate (and thus injection schedule) varies among different esters, but medical injections are normally done anywhere between semi-weekly to once every 12 weeks. A more frequent schedule may be desirable in order to maintain a more constant level of hormone in the system.<ref name=Chr/> Injectable steroids are typically administered into the muscle, not into the vein, to avoid sudden changes in the amount of the drug in the bloodstream. In addition, because estered testosterone is dissolved in oil, intravenous injection has the potential to cause a dangerous [[embolism]] (clot) in the bloodstream.

[[Transdermal patch]]es (adhesive patches placed on the skin) may also be used to deliver a steady dose through the skin and into the bloodstream. Testosterone-containing creams and gels that are applied daily to the skin are also available, but absorption is inefficient (roughly 10%, varying between individuals) and these treatments tend to be more expensive. Individuals who are especially physically active and/or bathe often may not be good candidates, since the medication can be washed off and may take up to six hours to be fully absorbed. There is also the risk that an intimate partner or child may come in contact with the application site and inadvertently dose himself or herself; children and women are highly sensitive to testosterone and can suffer unintended masculinization and health effects, even from small doses. Injection is the most common method used by individuals administering AAS for non-medical purposes.<ref name="Cohen2007"/>

The traditional routes of administration do not have differential effects on the efficacy of the drug. Studies indicate that the anabolic properties of AAS are relatively similar despite the differences in pharmacokinetic principles such as [[first-pass effect|first-pass metabolism]]. However, the orally available forms of AAS may cause [[hepatotoxicity|liver damage]] in high doses.<ref name=Kicman>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kicman AT, Gower DB |title=Anabolic steroids in sport: biochemical, clinical and analytical perspectives |journal=Ann.

===Physiological===
Depending on the length of drug abuse, there is a chance that the immune system can be damaged.

A number of severe side effects can occur if adolescents use AAS. For example, AAS may prematurely stop the lengthening of bones (premature [[epiphyseal plate|epiphyseal fusion]] through increased levels of estrogen [[metabolite]]s), resulting in [[stunted growth]]. Other effects include, but are not limited to, accelerated [[bone age|bone maturation]], increased frequency and duration of erections, and premature sexual development.

As their name suggests, AAS have two different, but overlapping, types of effects: ''anabolic'', meaning that they promote anabolism (cell growth), and ''androgenic'' (or ''virilizing''), meaning that they affect the development and maintenance of masculine characteristics.

Some examples of the anabolic effects of these hormones are increased [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]] from [[amino acid]]s, increased appetite, increased bone remodeling and growth, and stimulation of [[bone marrow]], which increases the production of [[red blood cell]]s. Through a number of [[Anabolic steroid#Mechanism of action|mechanisms]] AAS stimulate the formation of muscle cells and hence cause an increase in the size of [[skeletal muscles]], leading to increased strength.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Schroeder ET, Vallejo AF, Zheng L, Stewart Y, Flores C, Nakao S, Martinez C, Sattler FR |title=Six-week improvements in muscle mass and strength during androgen therapy in older men |journal=J Gerontol a Biol Sci Med Sci |volume=60 |issue=12 |pages=1586–92 |year=2005 |pmid=16424293 |doi=10.1093/gerona/60.12.1586}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Grunfeld C, Kotler DP, Dobs A, Glesby M, Bhasin S |title=Oxandrolone in the treatment of HIV-associated weight loss in men: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study |journal=J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=304–14 |year=2006 |pmid=16540931 |doi=10.1097/01.qai.0000197546.56131.40}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Giorgi A, Weatherby RP, Murphy PW |title=Muscular strength, body composition and health responses to the use of testosterone enanthate: a double blind study |journal=Journal of science and medicine in sport / Sports Medicine Australia |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=341–55 |year=1999 |pmid=10710012 |doi=10.1016/S1440-2440(99)80007-3}}</ref>

The androgenic effects of AAS are numerous. Depending on the length of use, the side effects of the steroid can be irreversible. Processes affected include pubertal growth, [[sebaceous gland]] oil production, and sexuality (especially in fetal development). Some examples of virilizing effects are [[clitoral hypertrophy|growth of the clitoris]] in females and the [[penis]] in male children (the adult penis size does not change due to steroids{{medcn|date=March 2013}} ), increased [[vocal cord]] size, increased [[libido]], suppression of [[endogenous|natural]] [[sex hormone]]s, and impaired [[spermatogenesis|production of sperm]].<ref name="DoirpMissing">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuhn CM |title=Anabolic steroids |journal=Recent Prog.

The androgenic:anabolic ratio of an AAS is an important factor when determining the clinical application of these compounds. Compounds with a high ratio of androgenic to an anabolic effects are the drug of choice in androgen-replacement therapy (e.g., treating [[hypogonadism]] in males), whereas compounds with a reduced androgenic:anabolic ratio are preferred for anemia and osteoporosis, and to reverse protein loss following trauma, surgery, or prolonged immobilization. Determination of androgenic:anabolic ratio is typically performed in animal studies, which has led to the marketing of some compounds claimed to have anabolic activity with weak androgenic effects. This disassociation is less marked in humans, where all AAS have significant androgenic effects.<ref name="Chr">{{cite book | editor-last = Katzung | editor-first = Bertram G. |last=Chrousos |first=George P. |chapter=The Gonadal Hormones & Inhibitors |title=Basic & Clinical Pharmacology |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical McGraw-Hill distributor |location=New York London |year=2012 |isbn=0071764011}}</ref>

A commonly used protocol for determining the androgenic:anabolic ratio, dating back to the 1950s, uses the relative weights of ventral [[prostate]] (VP) and [[levator ani]] muscle (LA) of male [[Laboratory rat|rats]]. The VP weight is an indicator of the androgenic effect, while the LA weight is an indicator of the anabolic effect. Two or more batches of rats are [[castrated]] and given no treatment and respectively some AAS of interest. The ''LA/VP ratio'' for an AAS is calculated as the ratio of LA/VP weight gains produced by the treatment with that compound using castrated but untreated rats as baseline: (LA<sub>c,t</sub>–LA<sub>c</sub>)/(VP<sub>c,t</sub>–VP<sub>c</sub>). The LA/VP weight gain ratio from rat experiments is not unitary for testosterone (typically 0.3–0.4), but it is normalized for presentation purposes, and used as basis of comparison for other AAS, which have their androgenic:anabolic ratios scaled accordingly (as shown in the table above).<ref name=pmid9593936/><ref name="pmid13064212">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hershberger LG, Shipley EG, Meyer RK | title = Myotrophic activity of 19-nortestosterone and other steroids determined by modified levator ani muscle method | journal = Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

====Body composition and strength improvements====
Body weight in men may increase by 2–5&nbsp;kg as a result of short-term (<10 weeks) AAS use, which may be attributed mainly to an increase of lean mass. Animal studies also found that fat mass was reduced, but most studies in humans failed to elucidate significant fat mass decrements. The effects on lean body mass have been shown to be dose-dependent. Both [[muscle hypertrophy]] and the formation of new [[muscle fibers]] have been observed. The hydration of lean mass remains unaffected by AAS use, although small increments of blood volume cannot be ruled out.<ref name="Hartgens and Kuipers 2004"/>

The upper region of the body (thorax, neck, shoulders, and upper arm) seems to be more susceptible for AAS than other body regions because of predominance of ARs in the upper body.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} The largest difference in muscle fiber size between AAS users and non-users was observed in type I muscle fibers of the [[vastus lateralis]] and the [[trapezius muscle]] as a result of long-term AAS self-administration.

===Dissociation of anabolic and androgenic effects===
Endogenous/natural AAS like testosterone and DHT and synthetic AAS mediate their effects by binding to and activating the AR.<ref name="Kicman2008"/> On the basis of animal [[bioassay]]s, the effects of these agents have been divided into two partially dissociable types: anabolic (myotrophic) and androgenic.<ref name="Kicman2008" /> Dissociation between the ratios of these two types of effects is observed in rat bioassays with various AAS relative to the ratio observed with testosterone.<ref name="Kicman2008" /> Explanations for the dissociation include differences in [[intracellular]] [[metabolism]], [[functional selectivity]] (recruitment of [[coactivator (genetics)|coactivator]]s), and [[Nuclear receptor#Non-genomic|non-genomic]] mechanisms (i.e., signaling through non-AR [[membrane androgen receptor]]s, or mARs).<ref name="Kicman2008" /> Support for the latter two explanations is limited and more hypothetical, but there is a good deal of support for the intracellular metabolism explanation.<ref name="Kicman2008" />

The measurement of the dissociation between anabolic and androgenic effects among AAS is based largely on a simple although arguably unsophisticated and outdated model involving rat tissue bioassays.<ref name="Kicman2008" /> It is referred to as the [[myotrophic-androgenic index]].<ref name="Kicman2008" /> In this model, anabolic (myotrophic) activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat [[bulbospongiosus muscle|bulbocavernosus]]/[[levator ani]] muscle and androgenic activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat [[prostate gland|ventral prostate]] (or, alternatively, the rat [[seminal vesicles]]) in response to exposure to the AAS, and the measurements are then compared and used to form a ratio.<ref name="Kicman2008" />

====Intracellular metabolism====
Testosterone is [[metabolism|metabolized]] in various tissues by [[5α-reductase]] into DHT, which is 3- to 10-fold more potent as an AR agonist, and by [[aromatase]] into [[estradiol]], which is an [[estrogen]] and lacks significant AR affinity.<ref name="Kicman2008" /> In addition, DHT is metabolized by [[3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]] (3α-HSD) and [[3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]] (3β-HSD) into [[3α-androstanediol]] and [[3β-androstanediol]], respectively, which are [[metabolite]]s with little or no AR affinity.<ref name="Kicman2008" /> 5α-Reductase is widely distributed throughout the body, and is concentrated to various extents in skin (particularly the scalp, beard-area of the face, pubic area, and genital area (penis and scrotum)), prostate, seminal vesicles, liver, and the brain.<ref name="Kicman2008" /> In contrast, expression of 5α-reductase in [[skeletal muscle]] is undetectable.<ref name="Kicman2008" /> Aromatase is highly expressed in [[adipose tissue]] and the brain, and is also expressed significantly in skeletal muscle.<ref name="Kicman2008" /> 3α-HSD is also highly expressed in skeletal muscle.<ref name="Llewellyn2011" />

Natural AAS like testosterone and DHT and synthetic AAS are analogues of each other and are very similar structurally.<ref name="Kicman2008" /> For this reason, they have the capacity to bind to and be metabolized by the same [[enzyme]]s.<ref name="Kicman2008" /> According to the intracellular metabolism explanation, the androgenic-to-anabolic ratio of a given AR agonist is based on its capacity to be transformed by the aforementioned enzymes in conjunction with the AR activity of any resulting products.<ref name="Kicman2008" /> As an example, whereas the AR activity of testosterone is greatly potentiated by local conversion via 5α-reductase into DHT in tissues where 5α-reductase is expressed, an AAS that is not metabolized by 5α-reductase or has already been 5α-reduced, such as DHT itself or a derivative (like mesterolone or drostanolone), would not experience such potentiation in said tissues.<ref name="Kicman2008" /> Moreover, nandrolone is metabolized by 5α-reductase, but unlike the case of testosterone and DHT, the 5α-reduced metabolite of nandrolone has much lower affinity for the AR than does nandrolone itself, and this results in reduced AR activation in 5α-reductase-expressing tissues.<ref name="Kicman2008" /> As so-called "androgenic" tissues such as skin/hair follicles and reproductive tissues are very high in 5α-reductase expression, while skeletal muscle is virtually devoid of 5α-reductase, this may primarily explain the high myotrophic-androgenic ratio and dissociation seen with nandrolone, as well as with various other AAS.<ref name="Kicman2008" />

Aside from 5α-reductase, aromatase may inactivate testosterone signaling in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, so AAS that lack aromatase affinity, in addition to being free of the potential side effect of [[gynecomastia]], might be expected to have a higher myotrophic-androgenic ratio in comparison.<ref name="Kicman2008" /> In addition, DHT is inactivated by high activity of 3α-HSD in skeletal muscle (and cardiac tissue), and AAS that lack affinity for 3α-HSD could similarly be expected to have a higher myotrophic-androgenic ratio (although perhaps also increased long-term cardiovascular risks).<ref name="Kicman2008" /> In accordance, DHT, [[mesterolone]] (1α-methyl-DHT), and [[mestanolone]] (17α-methyl-DHT) are all described as very poorly anabolic due to inactivation by 3α-HSD in skeletal muscle, whereas other DHT derivatives like [[oxandrolone]], [[oxymetholone]], [[drostanolone]], and [[stanozolol]] are all poor substrates for 3α-HSD and are described as potent anabolics.<ref name="Llewellyn2011" />

The intracellular metabolism theory explains how and why remarkable dissociation between anabolic and androgenic effects can occur, but why dissociation is invariably incomplete.<ref name="Kicman2008" /> In support of the model is the rare condition [[congenital 5α-reductase deficiency]], in which the 5α-reductase enzyme is defective, production of DHT is impaired, and DHT levels are very low while testosterone levels are normal.<ref name="Imperato-McGinleyPeterson1979">{{cite journal | vauthors = Imperato-McGinley J, Peterson RE, Gautier T, Sturla E | title = Androgens and the evolution of male-gender identity among male pseudohermaphrodites with 5alpha-reductase deficiency | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 300 | issue = 22 | pages = 1233–7 | date = May 1979 | pmid = 431680 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM197905313002201 }}</ref><ref name="pmid16985920">{{cite journal | vauthors = Marks LS |title=5α-reductase: history and clinical importance |journal=Rev Urol |volume=6 Suppl 9 |issue= |pages=S11–21 |year=2004 |pmid=16985920 |pmc=1472916 |doi=}}</ref> Males with this condition are born with [[ambiguous genitalia]] and an underdeveloped prostate gland.<ref name="Imperato-McGinleyPeterson1979" /><ref name="pmid16985920" /> In addition, saliently, such males develop normal musculature, voice changes/deepening, and libido at puberty, but have little to no [[acne]] or facial, pubic, or body hair, minimal enlargement of the prostate, and no incidence of [[male-pattern baldness]] or [[prostate cancer]].<ref name="pmid16985920" /><ref name="Sloane2002">{{cite book | first = Ethel | last = Sloane | name-list-format = vanc |title=Biology of Women |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kqcYyk7zlHYC&pg=PA160 |year=2002 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=0-7668-1142-5 |pages=160–}}</ref><ref name="HannoGuzzo2014" /><ref name="JainSiddiqi2006">{{cite book | first1 = N.

====Antigonadotropic activity====
Changes in endogenous testosterone levels may also contribute to differences in myotrophic-androgenic ratio between testosterone and synthetic AAS. AR agonists are [[antigonadotropic]] – that is, they dose-dependently suppress gonadal testosterone production and hence reduce systemic testosterone concentrations. By suppressing endogenous testosterone levels and effectively replacing AR signaling in the body with that of the exogenous AAS, the myotrophic-androgenic ratio would be expected to be further increased, and this hence may be yet an additional mechanism contributing to the differences in myotrophic-androgenic ratio. In addition, some AAS, such as nandrolone, are also potent [[progestogen]]s, and activation of the [[progesterone receptor]] is antigonadotropic similarly to activation of the AR. As such, combined progestogenic activity might further increase the myotrophic-androgenic ratio for a given AAS.

===Interaction with the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor===
Some AAS, such as testosterone, DHT, stanozolol, and methyltestosterone, have been found to modulate the [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor]] similarly to endogenous [[neurosteroid]]s like [[allopregnanolone]], [[3α-androstanediol]], [[dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate]], and [[pregnenolone sulfate]].<ref name="Kicman2008" /> It has been suggested that this may contribute as an alternative or additional mechanism to the neurological and behavioral effects of AAS.<ref name="Kicman2008" /><ref name="pmid8294123">{{cite journal |vauthors=Bitran D, Kellogg CK, Hilvers RJ |title=Treatment with an anabolic-androgenic steroid affects anxiety-related behavior and alters the sensitivity of cortical GABAA receptors in the rat |journal=Horm Behav |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=568–83 |year=1993 |pmid=8294123 |doi=10.1006/hbeh.1993.1041 }}</ref><ref name="pmid7603620">{{cite journal |vauthors=Masonis AE, McCarthy MP |title=Direct effects of the anabolic/androgenic steroids, stanozolol and 17α-methyltestosterone, on benzodiazepine binding to the γ-aminobutyric acid<sub>A</sub> receptor |journal=Neurosci.

===Comparison of AAS===

====5α-Reductase and androgenicity====
Testosterone can be robustly converted by [[5α-reductase]] into DHT in so-called androgenic tissues such as [[skin]], [[scalp]], [[prostate]], and [[seminal vesicles]], but not in [[muscle]] or [[bone]], where 5α-reductase either is not expressed or is only minimally expressed.<ref name="Kicman2008" /> As DHT is 3- to 10-fold more potent as an agonist of the AR than is testosterone, the AR agonist activity of testosterone is thus markedly and selectively potentiated in such tissues.<ref name="Kicman2008" /> In contrast to testosterone, DHT and other 4,5α-dihydrogenated AAS are already 5α-reduced, and for this reason, cannot be potentiated in androgenic tissues.<ref name="Kicman2008" /> 19-Nortestosterone derivatives like [[nandrolone]] can be [[metabolism|metabolized]] by 5α-reductase similarly to testosterone, but 5α-reduced metabolites of 19-nortestosterone derivatives (e.g., [[5α-dihydronandrolone]]) tend to have reduced activity as AR agonists, resulting in reduced androgenic activity in tissues that express 5α-reductase.<ref name="Kicman2008" /> In addition, some 19-nortestosterone derivatives, including [[trestolone]] (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone (MENT)), [[11β-methyl-19-nortestosterone]] (11β-MNT), and [[dimethandrolone]] (7α,11β-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone), cannot be 5α-reduced.<ref name="pmid20599615">{{cite journal | vauthors = Attardi BJ, Hild SA, Koduri S, Pham T, Pessaint L, Engbring J, Till B, Gropp D, Semon A, Reel JR | title = The potent synthetic androgens, dimethandrolone (7α,11β-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone) and 11β-methyl-19-nortestosterone, do not require 5α-reduction to exert their maximal androgenic effects | journal = The Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology | volume = 122 | issue = 4 | pages = 212–8 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20599615 | pmc = 2949447 | doi = 10.1016/j.jsbmb.2010.06.009 }}</ref> Conversely, 17α-alkylated AAS can be 5α-reduced and are potentiated in androgenic tissues similarly to testosterone,{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} with an exception being 17α-alkylated AAS that are already 4,5α-reduced.<ref name="Kicman2008" />

====Aromatase and estrogenicity====
Testosterone can be [[metabolism|metabolized]] by [[aromatase]] into [[estradiol]], and many other AAS can be metabolized into their corresponding [[estrogen]]ic metabolites as well.<ref name="Kicman2008" /> As an example, the 17α-alkylated AAS [[methyltestosterone]] and [[metandienone]] are converted by aromatase into [[methylestradiol]].<ref name="ThiemeHemmersbach2009">{{cite book|author1=Thieme, Detlef |author2=Hemmersbach, Peter |title=Doping in Sports|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R-hIC-caIn8C&pg=PA470|date=18 December 2009|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-79088-4|pages=470–}}</ref> 4,5α-Dihydrogenated derivatives of testosterone such as DHT cannot be aromatized, whereas 19-nortestosterone derivatives like nandrolone can be but to a greatly reduced extent.<ref name="Kicman2008" /><ref name="pmid18555683">{{cite journal | vauthors = Attardi BJ, Pham TC, Radler LC, Burgenson J, Hild SA, Reel JR | title = Dimethandrolone (7,11β-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone) and 11β-methyl-19-nortestosterone are not converted to aromatic A-ring products in the presence of recombinant human aromatase | journal = The Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology | volume = 110 | issue = 3–5 | pages = 214–22 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18555683 | pmc = 2575079 | doi = 10.1016/j.jsbmb.2007.11.009 }}</ref> Some 19-nortestosterone derivatives, such as dimethandrolone and 11β-MNT, cannot be aromatized due to [[steric hindrance]] provided by their 11β-methyl group, whereas the closely related AAS trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone), in relation to its lack of an 11β-methyl group, can be aromatized.<ref name="pmid18555683" /> AAS that are 17α-alkylated (and not also 4,5α-reduced or 19-demethylated) are also aromatized but to a lesser extent than is testosterone.<ref name="Kicman2008" /><ref name="Llewellyn2011">{{cite book|author=Llewellyn, William |title=Anabolics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=afKLA-6wW0oC&pg=PT533|year=2011|publisher=Molecular Nutrition Llc|isbn=978-0-9828280-1-4|pages=533–}}</ref> However, it is notable that estrogens that are 17α-substituted (e.g., [[ethinylestradiol]] and methylestradiol) are of markedly increased estrogenic potency due to improved [[metabolic stability]],<ref name="ThiemeHemmersbach2009" /> and for this reason, 17α-alkylated AAS can actually have high estrogenicity and comparatively greater estrogenic effects than testosterone.<ref name="ThiemeHemmersbach2009" /><ref name="Llewellyn2011" />

The major effect of estrogenicity is [[gynecomastia]] (woman-like breasts).<ref name="Kicman2008" /> AAS that have a high potential for aromatization like testosterone and particularly methyltestosterone show a high risk of gynecomastia, while AAS that have a reduced potential for aromatization like nandrolone show a much lower risk (though still significant at high dosages).<ref name="Kicman2008" /> In contrast, AAS that are 4,5α-reduced, and some other AAS (e.g., 11β-methylated 19-nortestosterone derivatives), have no risk of gynecomastia.<ref name="Kicman2008" /> In addition to gynecomastia, AAS with high estrogenicity have increased antigonadotropic activity, which results in increased potency in suppression of the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis]] and [[gonad]]al testosterone production.<ref name="pmid19231088">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tan RS, Scally MC | title = Anabolic steroid-induced hypogonadism—towards a unified hypothesis of anabolic steroid action | journal = Med.

Many 19-nortestosterone derivatives, including nandrolone, [[trenbolone]], [[ethylestrenol]] (ethylnandrol), [[metribolone]] (R-1881), trestolone, 11β-MNT, dimethandrolone, and others, are potent agonists of the [[progesterone receptor]] (AR) and hence are [[progestogen]]s in addition to AAS.<ref name="Kicman2008" /><ref name="pmid16497801">{{cite journal | vauthors = Attardi BJ, Hild SA, Reel JR | title = Dimethandrolone undecanoate: a new potent orally active androgen with progestational activity | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 147 | issue = 6 | pages = 3016–26 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16497801 | doi = 10.1210/en.2005-1524 }}</ref> Similarly to the case of estrogenic activity, the progestogenic activity of these drugs serves to augment their antigonadotropic activity.<ref name="pmid16497801" /> This results in increased potency and effectiveness of these AAS as [[wikt:antispermatogenic|antispermatogenic agent]]s and [[male contraceptive]]s (or, put in another way, increased potency and effectiveness in producing [[azoospermia]] and reversible [[male infertility]]).<ref name="pmid16497801" />

====Oral activity and hepatotoxicity====
Non-17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives such as testosterone itself, DHT, and nandrolone all have poor oral bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism and hence are not orally active.<ref name="Kicman2008" /> A notable exception to this are AAS that are androgen [[precursor (biochemistry)|precursor]]s or [[androgen prohormone|prohormone]]s, including [[dehydroepiandrosterone]] (DHEA), [[androstenediol]], [[androstenedione]], [[boldione]] (androstadienedione), [[bolandiol]] (norandrostenediol), [[bolandione]] (norandrostenedione), [[dienedione]], [[mentabolan]] (MENT dione, trestione), and [[methoxydienone]] (methoxygonadiene) (although these are relatively weak AAS).<ref name="WarrenConstantini2000">{{cite book|author1=Warren, Michelle P. |author2=Constantini, Naama W. |title=Sports Endocrinology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HNJ9BwAAQBAJ&pg=PA458|date=1 May 2000|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-59259-016-2|pages=458–}}</ref><ref name="GregoryTravis2015">{{cite book|author1=Haff, G.

===Detection in body fluids===
The most commonly employed human physiological specimen for detecting AAS usage is urine, although both blood and hair have been investigated for this purpose. The AAS, whether of endogenous or exogenous origin, are subject to extensive hepatic biotransformation by a variety of enzymatic pathways. The primary urinary metabolites may be detectable for up to 30 days after the last use, depending on the specific agent, dose and route of administration. A number of the drugs have common metabolic pathways, and their excretion profiles may overlap those of the endogenous steroids, making interpretation of testing results a very significant challenge to the analytical chemist. Methods for detection of the substances or their excretion products in urine specimens usually involve [[gas chromatography–mass spectrometry]] or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.<ref name="pmid18570179">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mareck U, Geyer H, Opfermann G, Thevis M, Schänzer W |title=Factors influencing the steroid profile in doping control analysis |journal=J Mass Spectrom |volume=43 |issue=7 |pages=877–91 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18570179 |doi=10.1002/jms.1457}}</ref><ref name="pmid19429460">{{cite journal |vauthors=Fragkaki AG, Angelis YS, Tsantili-Kakoulidou A, Koupparis M, Georgakopoulos C |title=Schemes of metabolic patterns of anabolic androgenic steroids for the estimation of metabolites of designer steroids in human urine |journal=J.

==History==

===Isolation of gonadal androgens===
The use of [[gonadal]] [[steroid]]s pre-dates their identification and isolation. Medical use of [[testicle]] extract began in the late 19th century while its effects on strength were still being studied.<ref name="DoirpMissing" /> The isolation of gonadal steroids can be traced back to 1931, when [[Adolf Butenandt]], a chemist in [[Marburg]], purified 15 milligrams of the male hormone [[androstenone]] from tens of thousands of litres of urine. This steroid was subsequently [[chemical synthesis|synthesized]] in 1934 by [[Leopold Ružička]], a chemist in [[Zurich]].<ref name = "PMID7817189"/>

In the 1930s, it was already known that the [[testes]] contain a more powerful androgen than [[androstenone]], and three groups of scientists, funded by competing [[pharmaceutical companies]] in the Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland, raced to isolate it.<ref name = "PMID7817189">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hoberman JM, Yesalis CE |title=The history of synthetic testosterone |journal=Scientific American |volume=272 |issue=2 |pages=76–81 |year=1995 |pmid=7817189 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0295-76}}</ref><ref name = "PMID11176375">{{cite journal |vauthors=Freeman ER, Bloom DA, McGuire EJ |title=A brief history of testosterone |journal=Journal of Urology |volume=165 |issue=2 |pages=371–373 |year=2001 |pmid=11176375 |doi=10.1097/00005392-200102000-00004}}</ref> This hormone was first identified by Karoly Gyula David, E.

===Development of synthetic AAS===
The development of muscle-building properties of testosterone was pursued in the 1940s, in the Soviet Union and in [[Eastern Bloc]] countries such as East Germany, where steroid programs were used to enhance the performance of [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] and other [[amateur sports|amateur]] [[Olympic weightlifting|weight lifters]]. In response to the success of Russian weightlifters, the U.S. Olympic Team physician [[John Bosley Ziegler|John Ziegler]] worked with synthetic chemists to develop an AAS with reduced androgenic effects.<ref name="pedsreview">{{cite journal |vauthors=Calfee R, Fadale P |title=Popular ergogenic drugs and supplements in young athletes |journal=Pediatrics |volume=117 |issue=3 |pages=e577–89 |year=2006 |pmid=16510635 |doi=10.1542/peds.2005-1429}}</ref> Ziegler's work resulted in the production of [[methandrostenolone]], which Ciba Pharmaceuticals marketed as Dianabol. The new steroid was approved for use in the U.S. by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1958. It was most commonly administered to burn victims and the elderly. The drug's [[off-label use]]rs were mostly bodybuilders and weight lifters. Although Ziegler prescribed only small doses to athletes, he soon discovered that those having abused Dianabol suffered from enlarged prostates and atrophied testes.<ref>Justin Peters [http://www.slate.com/id/2113752/ The Man Behind the Juice], ''Slate'' Friday, Feb. 18, 2005. Retrieved 29 April 2008</ref> AAS were placed on the list of banned substances of the IOC in 1976, and a decade later the committee introduced 'out-of-competition' doping tests because many athletes used AAS in their training period rather than during competition.<ref name="Hartgens and Kuipers 2004"/>

Three major ideas governed modifications of testosterone into a multitude of AAS: [[Alkylation]] at C17α position with [[methyl]] or [[ethyl group]] created orally active compounds because it slows the degradation of the drug by the liver; [[esterification]] of testosterone and [[nortestosterone]] at the C17β position allows the substance to be administered parenterally and increases the duration of effectiveness because agents soluble in oily liquids may be present in the body for several months; and alterations of the ring structure were applied for both oral and parenteral agents to seeking to obtain different anabolic-to-androgenic effect ratios.<ref name="Hartgens and Kuipers 2004"/>

==Society and culture==

===Legal status===
[[File:Compounds showing anabolic and androgenic effects.png|thumb|right|Various compounds with anabolic and androgenic effects, their relation with AAS]]
The legal status of AAS varies from country to country: some have stricter controls on their use or prescription than others though in many<!--most--> countries they are not illegal. In the U.S., AAS are currently listed as Schedule III [[controlled substances]] under the [[Controlled Substances Act]], which makes simple possession of such substances without a prescription a federal crime punishable by up to one year in prison for the first offense. Unlawful distribution or possession with intent to distribute AAS as a first offense is punished by up to ten years in prison.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/21usc/844.htm |title=Title 21 United States Code (USC) Controlled Substances Act |publisher=US Department of Justice |accessdate=2009-09-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724051512/http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/21usc/844.htm |archivedate=24 July 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref> In Canada, AAS and their derivatives are part of the [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act]] and are [[Schedule IV (Canada)|Schedule IV]] substances, meaning that it is illegal to obtain or sell them without a prescription; however, possession is not punishable, a consequence reserved for schedule I, II, or III substances. Those guilty of buying or selling AAS in Canada can be imprisoned for up to 18 months.<ref>{{Cite canlaw |short title=Controlled Drugs and Substances Act |abbr=S.C. |year=1996 |chapter=19 |section=4 |subsection=7 |link=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-38.8/page-2.html#h-4 |linkloc=Department of Justice |wikilink=Controlled Drugs and Substances Act}}</ref> Import and export also carry similar penalties.

In Canada, researchers have concluded that steroid use among student athletes is extremely widespread. A study conducted in 1993 by the Canadian Centre for Drug-Free Sport found that nearly 83,000 Canadians between the ages of 11 and 18 use steroids.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Deacon |first=James |title=Biceps in a bottle |journal=Maclean's |page=52 |date=2 May 1994}}</ref> AAS are also illegal without prescription in Australia,<ref>{{cite web|title=Steroids |publisher=Australian Institute of Criminology |year=2006 |url=http://www.aic.gov.au/research/drugs/types/steroids.html |accessdate=2007-05-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405033442/http://www.aic.gov.au/research/drugs/types/steroids.html |archivedate=2007-04-05 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref> Argentina{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}, Brazil{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} and Portugal{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}, and are listed as Class&nbsp;C [[Controlled Drug]]s in the United Kingdom. AAS are readily available without a prescription in some countries such as Mexico and Thailand.

====United States====
[[File:SteroidpillsDEA.jpg|thumb|right |200px| Steroid pills intercepted by the US Drug Enforcement Administration during the Operation Raw Deal bust in September 2007.]]
The history of the U.S. legislation on AAS goes back to the late 1980s, when the [[U.S. Congress]] considered placing AAS under the Controlled Substances Act following the controversy over [[Ben Johnson (sprinter)|Ben Johnson's]] victory at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]]. AAS were added to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act in the [[Anabolic Steroids Control Act of 1990]].<ref name="congress">{{USBill|101|HR|4658}}</ref>

The same act also introduced more stringent controls with higher criminal penalties for offenses involving the illegal distribution of AAS and human growth hormone. By the early 1990s, after AAS were scheduled in the U.S., several pharmaceutical companies stopped manufacturing or marketing the products in the U.S., including Ciba, Searle, Syntex, and others. In the Controlled Substances Act, AAS are defined to be any drug or hormonal substance chemically and pharmacologically related to testosterone (other than [[estrogen]]s, [[progestin]]s, and [[corticosteroid]]s) that promote muscle growth. The act was amended by the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004, which added [[prohormone]]s to the list of [[controlled substance]]s, with effect from January 20, 2005.<ref name="usdoj">{{cite web |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/cngrtest/ct031604.html |title=News from DEA, Congressional Testimony, 03/16/04 |accessdate=2007-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206195542/http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/cngrtest/ct031604.html |archivedate=February 6, 2007}}</ref>

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, AAS are classified as class C drugs for their illegal abuse potential, which puts them in the same class as [[benzodiazepines]]. AAS are in Schedule 4, which is divided in 2 parts; Part 1 contains most of the benzodiazepines and Part 2 contains the AAS.

Part 1 drugs are subject to full import and export controls with possession being an offence without an appropriate prescription. There is no restriction on the possession when it is part of a medicinal product. Part 2 drugs require a Home Office licence for importation and export unless the substance is in the form of a medicinal product and is for self-administration by a person.<ref>{{cite web |title=Patient.info Controlled Drugs |url=http://patient.info/doctor/controlled-drugs |publisher=Egton Medical Information Systems Limited |accessdate=8 August 2013}}</ref>

====Law enforcement====
United States federal law enforcement officials have expressed concern about AAS use by police officers. "It's a big problem, and from the number of cases, it's something we shouldn't ignore. It's not that we set out to target cops, but when we're in the middle of an active investigation into steroids, there have been quite a few cases that have led back to police officers," says Lawrence Payne, a spokesman for the United States [[Drug Enforcement Administration]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.annarbor.com/health/steroid-abuse-among-law-enforcement-a-problem-nationwide/ |title=Steroid abuse among law enforcement a problem nationwide |first=Juliana |last=Keeping |work=The Ann Arbor News |date=27 December 2010 |accessdate=1 December 2013}}</ref> The FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin stated that “Anabolic steroid abuse by police officers is a serious problem that merits greater awareness by departments across the country".<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.policechiefmagazine.org/magazine/index.cfm?fuseaction=display_arch&article_id=1512&issue_id=62008 |title=Anabolic Steroid Use and Abuse by Police Officers: Policy & Prevention |work=The Police Chief |date=June 2008 |accessdate=1 December 2013}}</ref> It is also believed that police officers across the United Kingdom "are using criminals to buy steroids" which he claims to be a top risk factor for [[police corruption]].

====Professional wrestling====

Following the [[Chris Benoit double murder and suicide|murder-suicide of Chris Benoit in 2007]], the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|Oversight and Government Reform Committee]] investigated steroid usage in the wrestling industry.<ref name="greenwichtimecontroversy">{{cite web |url=http://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Sunday-subscriber-advantage-WWE-steroid-385857.php#page-1 |title=WWE steroid investigation: A controversy McMahon 'doesn't need' | first = Brian | last = Lockhart | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Greenwich Time |date=2010-03-01 |accessdate=2010-03-01}}</ref> The Committee investigated [[WWE]] and [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA), asking for documentation of their companies' drug policies. WWE CEO and Chairman, [[Linda McMahon|Linda]] and [[Vince McMahon]] respectively, both testified. The documents stated that 75 wrestlers—roughly 40 percent—had tested positive for drug use since 2006, most commonly for steroids.<ref>[http://oversight.house.gov/images/stories/documents/20081231141129.pdf documents] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224020122/http://oversight.house.gov/images/stories/documents/20081231141129.pdf |date=December 24, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theday.com/article/20100609/NWS12/306099933/1019&town= |title=Deposition details McMahon steroid testimony &#124; News from southeastern Connecticut |publisher=The Day |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2010-08-14}}</ref>

[[File:Rd17.jpg|thumb|Several large buckets containing tens of thousands of AAS vials confiscated by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] during Operation Raw Deal in 2007.]]

AAS are frequently produced in pharmaceutical laboratories, but, in nations where stricter laws are present, they are also produced in small home-made underground laboratories, usually from raw substances imported from abroad.<ref name=Assael>{{cite news |first=Shaun |last=Assael |title='Raw Deal' busts labs across U.S., many supplied by China |date=2007-09-24 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=3033532 |work=ESPN The Magazine |accessdate=2007-09-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014050947/http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=3033532 |archivedate=14 October 2007 |deadurl=no}}</ref> In these countries, the majority of steroids are obtained illegally through [[black market]] trade.<ref name=cy>{{cite book |last=Yesalis |first=C |year=2000 |title=Anabolic Steroids in Sport and Exercise |isbn=978-0-88011-786-9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=I7-D2jH-OJ4C&pg=PA3 |chapter=Source of Anabolic Steroids |publisher=Human Kinetics |location=Champaign, Ill.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Black |first=Terry |title=Does the Ban on Drugs in Sport Improve Societal Welfare? |publisher=Faculty of Business, Queensland University of Technology |year=1996 |url=http://irs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/31/4/367 |accessdate=2007-04-24}}</ref> These steroids are usually manufactured in other countries, and therefore must be [[smuggling|smuggled]] across international borders.

In the late 2000s, the worldwide trade in illicit AAS increased significantly, and authorities announced record captures on three continents. In 2006, Finnish authorities announced a record seizure of 11.8 million AAS tablets. A year later, the DEA seized 11.4 million units of AAS in the largest U.S seizure ever. In the first three months of 2008, Australian customs reported a record 300 seizures of AAS shipments.<ref name=kanayama08>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kanayama G, Hudson JI, Pope HG |title=Long-term psychiatric and medical consequences of anabolic-androgenic steroid abuse: a looming public health concern? |journal=Drug Alcohol Depend |volume=98 |issue=1–2 |pages=1–12 |date=November 2008 |pmid=18599224 |pmc=2646607 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2008.05.004}}</ref>

In the U.S., Canada, and Europe, illegal steroids are sometimes purchased just as any other illegal drug, through dealers who are able to obtain the drugs from a number of sources. Illegal AAS are sometimes sold at gyms and competitions, and through the mail, but may also be obtained through pharmacists, veterinarians, and physicians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gdcada.org/statistics/steroids.htm |title=Steroids |accessdate=2007-09-13 |work=National Institute on Drug Abuse |publisher=GDCADA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911222757/http://www.gdcada.org/statistics/steroids.htm |archivedate=2007-09-11 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref> In addition, a significant number of counterfeit products are sold as AAS, in particular via mail order from websites posing as overseas pharmacies. In the U.S., black-market importation continues from Mexico, Thailand, and other countries where steroids are more easily available, as they are legal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/oig/reports/DEA/a0719/app2.htm |title=The Drug Enforcement Administration's International Operations (Redacted) |date=February 2007 |accessdate=2014-01-02 |work=Office of the Inspector General |publisher=USDOJ }}</ref>
