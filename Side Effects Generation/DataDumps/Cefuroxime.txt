'''Cefuroxime''' is an enteral second-generation [[cephalosporin]] [[antibiotic]]. It was discovered by Glaxo, now [[GlaxoSmithKline]], and first marketed in 1978 as Zinacef. It received approval from the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] in October 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/mtm/cefuroxime.html |title=Cefuroxime medical facts from |publisher=Drugs.com }}</ref>

[[Cefuroxime axetil]] is an acetoxyethyl-ester-prodrug of cefuroxime which is effective orally.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cb6BOkj9fK4C&pg=PA326 |title=Drug Discovery:   History |author=Walter Sneader}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
As with the other cephalosporins, it is susceptible to [[beta-lactamase]], although as a second-generation variety, it is less so. Hence, it may have greater activity against ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'', ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]'', and [[Lyme disease]]. Unlike most other second-generation cephalosporins, cefuroxime can cross the [[blood-brain barrier]].

A systematic review found high quality evidence that injecting the eye with cefuroxime after cataract surgery will lower the chance of developing [[endophthalmitis]] after surgery.<ref name="Gower">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gower EW, Lindsley K, Tulenko SE, Nanji AA, Leyngold I, McDonnell PJ |title= Perioperative antibiotics for prevention of acute endophthalmitis after cataract surgery |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|issue=2|pages= CD006364 |date=2017 |pmid= 28192644|doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD006364.pub3}}</ref>

==Side effects==
Cefuroxime is generally well-tolerated and its side effects are usually transient. If ingested after food, this antibiotic is both better absorbed and less likely to cause its most common side effects of [[diarrhea]], nausea, vomiting, headaches/[[migraine]]s, dizziness, and abdominal pain compared to most antibiotics in its class.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Although a widely stated cross-allergic risk of about 10% exists between cephalosporins and [[penicillin]], recent assessments have shown no increased risk for a cross-allergic reaction for cefuroxime and several other second-generation or later cephalosporins.<ref name="pmid16451776">{{cite journal |author=Pichichero ME |title=Cephalosporins can be prescribed safely for penicillin-allergic patients |journal=The Journal of family practice |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=106–12 |year=2006 |pmid=16451776 |url=http://www.jfponline.com/pdf%2F5502%2F5502JFP_AppliedEvidence1.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>
