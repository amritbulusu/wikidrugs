'''Moxonidine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) is a new-generation centrally acting [[antihypertensive]] drug licensed for the treatment of mild to moderate [[essential hypertension]]. It may have a role when [[thiazides]], [[beta-blocker]]s, [[ACE inhibitor]]s and [[calcium channel blocker]]s are not appropriate or have failed to control blood pressure. In addition, it demonstrates favourable effects on parameters of the [[insulin resistance]] syndrome, apparently independent of blood pressure reduction. It is manufactured by [[Solvay (company)|Solvay]] Pharmaceuticals under the brand name '''Physiotens'''.

==Mechanism of action==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
Moxonidine is a selective [[agonist]] at the [[imidazoline receptor]] subtype 1 (I<sub>1</sub>). This receptor subtype is found in both the rostral ventro-lateral pressor and ventromedial depressor areas of the [[medulla oblongata]]. Moxonidine therefore causes a decrease in [[sympathetic nervous system]] activity and, therefore, a decrease in [[blood pressure]].

Compared to the older central-acting antihypertensives, moxonidine binds with much greater affinity to the imidazoline I<sub>1</sub>-receptor than to the α<sub>2</sub>-receptor. In contrast, [[clonidine]] binds to both receptors with equal affinity.

In addition, moxonidine may also promote [[sodium]] excretion, improve insulin resistance and [[glucose]] tolerance and protect against hypertensive target organ damage, such as [[kidney]] disease and [[cardiac]] [[Organ hypertophy|hypertrophy]].

==Pharmacodynamic properties==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
'''Effects on insulin resistance'''

In all animal models of insulin resistance, moxonidine had striking effects on the development of insulin resistance, hyperinsulinaemia and impaired glucose homeostasis. Given the importance of insulin resistance as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, it is of considerable relevance that  it has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity.

Based on animal models, it has demonstrated that moxonidine is capable of:
* normalising plasma insulin levels
* improving glucose uptake in peripheral cells
* lowering lipid levels
* decreasing food intake and reducing weight gain in obese animals.

'''Renal function'''

Evidence is accumulating to show that sympathetic overactivity is substantially involved in the development and progression of chronic renal failure, contributing to a poor overall cardiovascular prognosis. Moxonidine has been shown to reduce structural renal damage in various models of renal failure.

'''Cardiac structure'''

In spontaneously hypertensive rats, moxonidine significantly reduced total heart weight, left ventricular weight and the ratio of ventricular weight to body weight compared with an untreated control group.

==Safety pharmacology==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
Routine toxicology studies have provided no evidence that moxonidine has any teratogenic, mutagenic or carcinogenic potential. No evidence has been found of serious adverse effects on organs or organ systems, and the drug has not been shown to have deleterious effects on perinatal or postnatal growth and development.

==Cautions==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
Moxonidine should be avoided in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Abrupt discontinuation of the drug should also be avoided. If concomitant treatment with a beta blocker has to be stopped, the beta blocker should be discontinued first, then moxonidine after a few days. Alcohol may potentiate the hypotensive effects of Moxonidine.

==Drug interactions==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
Concomitant administration of moxonidine and a thiazide diuretic such as [[hydrochlorothiazide]] is not indicated, as both drugs' hypotensive effects may be enhanced.

==Contraindications==
It is contraindicated if there has been a past history of [[angioedema]]; heart conduction disorders (e.g. [[sick sinus syndrome]], second- or third-degree [[heart block]]); [[bradycardia]]; severe [[heart failure]] or [[coronary artery disease]]. Also: [[Raynaud's syndrome]], [[intermittent claudication]], [[epilepsy]], depression, [[Parkinson's disease]], [[glaucoma]]. Use in pregnancy is discouraged. Moxonidine passes into breast milk.

Excess mortality has been seen in patients with symptomatic [[heart failure]] in the MOXCON study.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Cohn J, etal |title=Adverse mortality effect of central sympathetic inhibition with sustained-release moxonidine in patients with heart failure (MOXCON) |journal=Eur J Heart Fail |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=659–67 |year=2003 |pmid=14607206 |doi=10.1016/S1388-9842(03)00163-6}}</ref> However, the MOXCON trial prescribed very high dose of 3.0&nbsp;mg daily which is above the normal dose of 0.2–0.6&nbsp;mg daily.

==Side-effects==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
Noteworthy [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]]s include dry mouth, headache, fatigue, dizziness, intermittent facial oedema, nausea, sleep disturbances (rarely sedation), [[asthenia]], vasodilatation, and rarely, skin reactions.
