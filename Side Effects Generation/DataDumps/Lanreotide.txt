'''Lanreotide''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) is a medication used in the management of [[acromegaly]] and symptoms caused by [[neuroendocrine tumor]]s, most notably [[carcinoid syndrome]]. It is a long-acting [[analog (chemistry)|analogue]] of [[somatostatin]], like [[octreotide]]. Its sequence is H-D-2Nal-Cys(1)-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys(1)-Thr-NH2.

Lanreotide (as lanreotide [[acetate]]) is manufactured by [[Ipsen]], and marketed under the trade name '''Somatuline'''. It is available in several countries, including the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]] and [[Canada]], and was approved for sale in the [[United States]] by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) on August 30, 2007.<ref>{{cite press release | url = http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2007/NEW01692.html | title = FDA Approves New Drug to Treat Rare Disease, Acromegaly | date = August 30, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-09-06 | publisher = U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]]}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==
Lanreotide is a synthetic analogue of [[somatostatin]], a naturally occurring inhibitory [[hormone]] which blocks the release of several other hormones, including [[growth hormone]], [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH), [[insulin]] and [[glucagon]]. Lanreotide binds to the same [[somatostatin receptor|receptor]]s as somatostatin, although with higher affinity to peripheral receptors, and has similar activity. However, while somatostatin is quickly broken down in the body (within minutes),<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rens-Domiano S, Reisine T |title=Biochemical and functional properties of somatostatin receptors |journal=J Neurochem |volume=58 |issue=6 |pages=1987&ndash;96 |year=1992 |pmid=1315373 |doi=10.1111/j.1471-4159.1992.tb10938.x}}</ref> lanreotide has a much longer half-life, and produces far more prolonged effects.

The efficacy of lanreotide has not been extensively studied, and results differ greatly between trials and formulations.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Indications==
Lanreotide is used in the treatment of [[acromegaly]], due to both [[pituitary gland|pituitary]] and non-pituitary growth hormone-secreting tumors, and the management of symptoms caused by [[neuroendocrine tumor]]s, particularly [[carcinoid tumor]]s and [[VIPoma]]s. In the United States and Canada, lanreotide is only indicated for the treatment of acromegaly. In the United Kingdom, it is also indicated in the treatment of [[thyrotrope|thyrotrophic]] [[pituitary adenoma|adenoma]],<ref name="eMC_LA">{{cite web | url = http://emc.medicines.org.uk/emc/assets/c/html/displaydoc.asp?documentid=877 | title = Somatuline LA | date = September 17, 2003 | accessdate = 2007-03-02 | publisher = electronic Medicines Compendium}}</ref> a rare tumor of the pituitary gland which secretes TSH.

Lanreotide also shows activity against non-endocrine tumors, and, along with other [[somatostatin analogue]]s, is being studied as a possible general antitumor agent.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kvols L, Woltering E |title=Role of somatostatin analogs in the clinical management of non-neuroendocrine solid tumors |journal=Anticancer Drugs |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=601&ndash;8 |year=2006 |pmid=16917205 |doi=10.1097/01.cad.0000210335.95828.ed}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Susini C, Buscail L |title=Rationale for the use of somatostatin analogs as antitumor agents |journal=Ann Oncol |volume=17 |issue=12 |pages=1733&ndash;42 |year=2006 |pmid=16801334 |doi=10.1093/annonc/mdl105}}</ref>

In Dec 2014 the US FDA approved lanreotide for the treatment of patients with unresectable, well or moderately differentiated, locally advanced or metastatic gastroenteropancreatic [[neuroendocrine tumor]]s ([[GEP-NET]]s).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cancernetwork.com/gastrointestinal-cancer/fda-approves-lanreotide-injection-gep-nets |title=FDA Approves Lanreotide Injection for GEP-NETs |year=2014 }}</ref>

It is used for polycystic liver disease. It has also been shown that it reduces the volume by 264mls on average.

==Side effects==
The main [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]]s of lanreotide treatment are mild to moderate pain at the injection site and [[gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] disturbances, such as [[diarrhea]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]]. Isolated cases of [[cholelithiasis|gallstone formation]] have been associated with use of lanreotide, particularly over long periods of time.<ref name="eMC_LA"/>

==Formulations==
Lanreotide is available in two formulations: a sustained release formulation (sold under the trade name 'Somatuline LA'), which is [[Intramuscular injection|injected intramuscularly]] every ten or fourteen days,<ref name="eMC_LA"/> and an extended release formulation (UK trade name 'Somatuline Autogel', or 'Somatuline [[Injection (medicine)#Depot injection|Depot]]' in the U.S.), which is administered subcutaneously once a month.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://emc.medicines.org.uk/emc/assets/c/html/displaydoc.asp?documentid=8203 | title = Somatuline Autogel | date = April 12, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-04-19 | publisher = electronic Medicines Compendium}}</ref>

==Self-assembling properties==
Lanreotide has been shown to spontaneously self-assemble into monodisperse nanotubes of 24.4&nbsp;nm diameter<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Val√©ry C, Paternostre M, Robert B, Gulik-Krzywicki T, Narayanan T, Dedieu JC, Keller G, Torres ML, Cherif-Cheikh R, Calvo P, Artzner F |title=Biomimetic organization: Octapeptide self-assembly into nanotubes of viral capsid-like dimension |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=100 |issue=18 |pages=10258&ndash;62 |year=2003 |pmid= 12930900|doi=10.1073/pnas.1730609100 |pmc=193548}}</ref> and has been thereafter used as a fruitful and versatile model system in several biophysical studies.
