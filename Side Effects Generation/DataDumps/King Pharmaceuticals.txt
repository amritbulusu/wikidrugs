==Company history==
King Pharmaceuticals was founded in 1993 [[John M. Gregory (businessman)|John M. Gregory]], [[Randal J. Kirk]], Joseph "Joe" R. Gregory, Jefferson "Jeff" J. Gregory, and James E. Gregory.<ref>[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/King-Pharmaceuticals-Inc-Company-History.html King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - Company History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20030201091134/http://www.kingpharm.com/chairman.htm King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - Message From Our Chairman.</ref> In January 1994, King acquired a former [[King University|King College]] campus plant in Bristol, Tennessee. The {{convert|500000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} facility was purchased for $1.18 million from RSR Pharmaceutical, who had been using it after Beecham merged with [[SmithKline]].  King initially manufactured drugs for other pharmaceutical companies, but soon established a strategy of acquiring branded prescription drugs, which have a much higher gross margin than contract manufactured drugs.

In February 1998, King acquired 15 branded pharmaceuticals, a sterile products manufacturing facility located in Rochester, Michigan that it called the "Parkedale Facility") and some contract manufacturing contracts.<ref>{{cite web|title=King Pharmaceuticals, Amendment 8 to Form S-1|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=680633|publisher=NASDAQ|date=June 2, 1988}}</ref>  By December 1998 King had placed its sterile products business into a subsidiary it named Parkedale Pharmaceuticals.<ref>{{cite web|title=Press Release: King Pharmaceuticals and Hoechst Marion Roussel Sign an Agreement for One Of The Largest Single Product Transactions in Emerging Pharmaceutical Sector {{!}} Evaluate|url=http://www.evaluategroup.com/Universal/View.aspx?type=Story&id=173748|publisher=King, via Evaluate|date=December 18, 1998}}</ref>

King Pharmaceuticals obtained about twenty smaller branded drugs from the start up of the company until it went public in June 1998. The King Pharmaceuticals subsidiary Monarch Pharmaceuticals acquired one of its most profitable branded drugs, Altace, later the same year on December 18, 1998 from [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst Marion Roussel]].

==U.S. marketing and distribution rights to Altace™==

During 1994, the U.S. [[National Right to Life Committee]] announced an anti-[[RU-486]] [[boycott]], targeting all Hoechst pharmaceutical products including [[Altace]]™. By September 17, the [[pro-life]] organization Pharmacists For Life International joined the NRLC anti-RU-486 boycott "...against the American subsidiary of Hoechst, AG Hoechst-Roussel, Hoechst-Celanese, its generic subsidiary Copley Pharmaceuticals and the agricultural Hoechst subsidiary"<ref name="pln-0419">[http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/ProLife.News/1994/pln-0419.txt "3) Pharmacists For Life Joins International Boycott"]. Life Communications. November, 1994.</ref> while asking U.S. consumers to "...focus on key Hoechst drugs which have the most economic impact rather than taking an across-the-board shotgun approach"<ref name="pln-0419"/> and specifically targeting Altace as a boycott list item.<ref name="pln-0419"/><ref>[https://archive.li/CApP4 "Abortion Foes To Boycott Drugs (Altace) Made By RU-486 Manufacturer"]. ''The Virginia-Pilot''. Associated Press. July 8, 1994.</ref>

Hoechst merged with Marion Merrill Dow of Kansas City, Missouri in 1995, forming the Hoechst U.S. pharmaceutical subsidiary Hoechst Marion Roussel (HMR). Altace was bringing in under $90 million in U.S. revenues for HMR and Hoechst had stopped promoting Altace within the United States.,<ref name="136_print">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080403070806/http://www.forbesimg.com/forbes/2002/1028/136_print.html "Faith Healers: The born-again Gregory brothers worked a financial miracle from cast-off drug brands"]. Forbes. Zina Moukheiber. October 28, 2002.</ref> and King Pharmaceuticals President Jefferson "Jeff" Gregory also began negotiations in 1995 with Hoechst to acquire U.S. distribution rights to Altace.<ref name="136_print"/>

The King Pharmaceuticals wholly owned subsidiary Monarch Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (another brother of John Gregory - Joseph Gregory - was then the president of Monarch Pharmaceuticals) acquired ownership of the U.S. distribution and marketing rights to Altace and other Hoescht products from Hoescht AG subsidiary Hoechst Marion Roussel of Kansas City, Missouri on December 18, 1998, and<ref>[http://www.custservices.com/news.asp?up=8 "Monarch Pharmaceuticals acquired"]. sanofi-aventis Group. December 18, 1998.</ref> following a January 1999 merger a few weeks later with [[Rhône-Poulenc]], Hoechst assumed the new corporate identity of [[Aventis]]).

In 2001, ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine ranked John Gregory among the 400 richest Americans. The bulk of Gregory's personal fortune was due in large part due to the ability of King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to reintroduce the Hoechst branded prescription drug Altace back into the U.S. market under the King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. subsidiary Monarch Pharmaceuticals brand following the 1998 U.S. marketing and distribution agreement between King Pharmaceuticals/Monarch Pharmaceuticals and AG Hoechst/HMR.

In late December 1998, King Pharmaceuticals (d.b.a. Monarch Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) purchased the U.S. marketing and distribution rights of the company's most successful drug, Altace, for $362.5 million from the U.S. subsidiary of [[Hoechst AG]], Hoechst Marion Roussel of Kansas City.<ref>http://archive.twst.com/notes/articles/jab202.html "King Pharmaceuticals CEO focuses on patented products".</ref> As a result of increasing the number of sales representatives and the findings of the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation ([http://www.chd-taskforce.com/pdf/sk_hope.pdf HOPE]), Altace sales skyrocketed. Using profits from Altace, King continued to add product lines, the most significant purchases being [[Levoxyl]], [[Thrombin]], and [[Cytomel]] in 2000.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Also in 2000, seeing fewer opportunities to obtain branded drugs, the company acquired an R&D company based in North Carolina.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} In 2002, King and [[Meridian Medical Technologies Inc.]] agreed that King would purchase Merdian for $247.8 million in cash; Meridian was a manufacturer of autoinjectors, including EpiPen, an [[epinephrine autoinjector]].<ref>King Pharmaceuticals Oct 21, 2002. [http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/king-pharmaceuticals-to-acquire-meridian-medical-technologies-76364227.html Press Release: King Pharmaceuticals to Acquire Meridian Medical Technologies]</ref>  The deal was completed in January 2003.<ref>King Pharmaceuticals [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1047699/000095014404006620/g89681e11vk.htm Form 11K] filed For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003.</ref>

In 2002, John Gregory stepped down as CEO, and his brother Jefferson Gregory took over. Then in 2004, Jeff Gregory stepped down as well after the SEC began investigations into King’s Medicaid billing practices.<ref>[http://www.thestreet.com/_tsclsii/stocks/robertsteyer/10144369.html TheStreet.com : King Pharmaceuticals CEO to Step Down | Robert Steyer | KG<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The board named Brian Markison to replace him. Soon after, in July 2004, a deal was made for [[Mylan Laboratories]] to acquire King for $4 billion.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB109079748272873376?mod=googlewsj | work=The Wall Street Journal | first1=Leila | last1=Abboud | first2=Dennis K. | last2=Berman | title=Mylan to Buy King Pharmaceuticals | date=July 26, 2004}}</ref> Investors, most notably [[Carl Icahn]], were critical of the merger, saying that Mylan was overpaying for King. The next year the deal was called off.

In 2008 King Pharmaceuticals acquired Alpharma Pharmaceuticals to expand into the pain treatment market.  From the acquisition, King gained the patents on the pain management drugs, Flector and Embeda.<ref>[http://www.dddmag.com/news-King-Pharmaceuticals-Acquires-Alpharma.aspx King Pharmaceuticals Acquires Alpharma]  They also gained a completely separate animal health division, which focuses on the many agricultural and animal health needs of livestock animals.</ref>

== Acquisition ==

On October 12, 2010, [[Pfizer]] Inc. ({{NYSE|PFE}}) announced it would acquire Bristol-based King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for a total cost to Pfizer of $3.6 billion in cash or $14.25 per share. The acquisition was expected to expand Pfizer's product line of pain relief and management medication by adding King products such as Embeda, Avinza, and the Flector Patch.<ref>[http://www.kingpharm.com/Investors/News_Details.cfm?news_item_id=564 Pfizer to Acquire King Pharmaceuticals, Inc.]</ref> Other product lines that made King attractive to Pfizer included the [[EpiPen]] for emergency delivery of medications and the Alpharma animal health line.<ref name=PfizerMarch2011>{{cite web|url=http://www.pfizer.com/news/press_releases/pfizer_press_release_archive.jsp?guid=20110301006102en&source=2011&page=14 |title=Pfizer Completes Acquisition Of King Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Pfizer and King begin joint operations on March 1, 2011 |date= March 1, 2011 |publisher=Pfizer |type=press release}}</ref>
