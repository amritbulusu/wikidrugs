It is sometimes used as a [[premedication]] (especially to reduce [[respiratory tract]] [[secretions]]) to [[surgery]], mostly commonly by [[Injection (medicine)|injection]].<ref name = BNF/><ref name = AMH/>

===Pregnancy===
Scopolamine crosses the [[placenta]] and is a [[Pregnancy category|pregnancy category C]] medication, meaning a risk to the [[fetus]] cannot be ruled out. Either studies in animals have revealed adverse effects on the fetus ([[teratogenic]] or [[embryocidal]] effects or other) and no controlled studies in women have been made, or studies in women and animals are not available. Drugs should be given only if the potential benefits justify the potential risk to the fetus. It may cause respiratory depression and/or [[neonatal]] [[hemorrhage]] when used during pregnancy, and some animal studies did report adverse events.{{citation needed |reason="some animal studies" is "weasel wording" |date=November 2015}} [[Transdermal]] scopolamine has been used as an adjunct to [[epidural anesthesia]] for [[Cesarean section|Caesarean delivery]] without adverse CNS effects on the newborn. Except when used prior to Caesarean section, it should only be used during pregnancy if the benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.

===Breastfeeding===
Scopolamine enters [[breast milk]] by [[secretion]]. Although no human studies exist to document the safety of scopolamine while nursing, the manufacturer recommends that caution be taken if scopolamine is administered to a breastfeeding woman.<ref>{{cite book |last=Briggs |title=Drugs in Pregnancy and Lactation |date=1994 |publisher=Williams and Wilkins |location=Baltimore, MD |pages=777–778}}</ref>

===Elderly===
The likelihood of experiencing adverse effects from scopolamine is increased in the elderly relative to younger people. This phenomenon is especially true for older people who are also on several other medications. It is recommended that scopolamine use should be avoided in this age group because of these potent anticholinergic adverse effects.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Flicker|author2=Ferris |title=Hypersensitivity to scopolamine in the elderly |journal=Psychopharmacology |date=1992 |pages=437–441 |pmid=1615141 |volume=107 |issue=2–3 |doi=10.1007/bf02245172}}</ref>

==Interactions==
Due to interactions with metabolism of other drugs, scopolamine can cause significant unwanted side effects when taken with other medications. Specific attention should be paid to other medications in the same [[Pharmacology|pharmacologic]] class as scopolamine, also known as [[anticholinergic]]s. The following medications could potentially interact with the metabolism of scopolamine: [[analgesics]]/pain medications, [[ethanol]], [[zolpidem]], [[thiazide diuretics]], [[buprenorphine]], anticholinergic drugs such as [[Tiotropium bromide|tiotropium]], etc.

==Route of administration==
Scopolamine can be taken by mouth, [[subcutaneous injection|subcutaneously]], [[Eye drop|ophthalmically]] and [[intravenous]]ly, as well as via a [[transdermal patch]].<ref name="White">{{cite journal |author = White, P.

==Mechanism of action==
Although it is usually referred to as a nonspecific antimuscarinic,<ref>https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=scopolamine+nonselective&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C11</ref> there is indirect evidence for [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1|m1-receptor subtype]] specificity.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The relative selectivity of anticholinergic drugs for the M1 and M2 muscarinic receptor subtypes.|journal=Movement Disorders|author=Burke, RE|date=1986|volume=1|issue=2|pages=135–144|doi=10.1002/mds.870010208|pmid=2904117}}</ref>

==Biosynthesis in plants==
Scopolamine is among the [[secondary metabolites]] of plants from [[Solanaceae]] (nightshade) family of plants, such as [[henbane]], [[jimson weed]] (''[[Datura]]''), angel's trumpets (''[[Brugmansia]]''), and corkwood (''[[Duboisia]]'').<ref name = "Muranaka_1993">{{cite journal |author1=Muranaka, T. |author2=Ohkawa, H. |author3=Yamada, Y. |title = Continuous Production of Scopolamine by a Culture of ''Duboisia leichhardtii'' Hairy Root Clone in a Bioreactor System |journal = Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology |volume = 40 |issue = 2–3 |pages = 219–223 |year = 1993 |doi = 10.1007/BF00170370 |url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/g7x30m6495332j8j/}}</ref><ref name=Chambers/>

The [[biosynthesis]] of scopolamine begins with the [[decarboxylation]] of [[L-ornithine]] to [[putrescine]] by [[ornithine decarboxylase]]. Putrescine is [[Methylation|methylated]] to N-methylputrescine by [[putrescine N-methyltransferase]].<ref name="Ziegler2008">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ziegler J, Facchini PJ | title = Alkaloid biosynthesis: metabolism and trafficking | journal = Annual Review of Plant Biology | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 735–69 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18251710 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.arplant.59.032607.092730 }}</ref>

A [[putrescine oxidase]] that specifically recognizes methylated putrescine catalyzes the [[deamination]] of this compound to 4-methylaminobutanal, which then undergoes a spontaneous ring formation to N-[[methyl]]-[[pyrrole|pyrrolium]] cation. In the next step, the pyrrolium cation condenses with [[acetoacetic acid]] yielding [[hygrine]]. No [[enzymatic]] activity could be demonstrated to catalyze this reaction. Hygrine further rearranges to [[tropinone]].<ref name="Ziegler2008" />

Subsequently, [[tropinone reductase I]] converts [[tropinone]] to [[tropine]] which condenses with [[phenylalanine]]-derived phenyllactate to [[littorine]]. A [[cytochrome P450]] classified as Cyp80F1<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Li R, Reed DW, Liu E, Nowak J, Pelcher LE, Page JE, Covello PS | title = Functional genomic analysis of alkaloid biosynthesis in Hyoscyamus niger reveals a cytochrome P450 involved in littorine rearrangement | journal = Chemistry & Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 513–20 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16720272 | doi = 10.1016/j.chembiol.2006.03.005 }}</ref> oxidizes and rearranges littorine to hyoscyamine [[aldehyde]]. In the final step, [[hyoscyamine]] undergoes [[epoxidation]] catalyzed by [[6beta-hydroxyhyoscyamine epoxidase]] yielding scopolamine.<ref name="Ziegler2008" />

==History==
One of the earlier alkaloids isolated from plant sources, scopolamine has been in use in its purified forms (such as various salts, including hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide and sulfate), since its isolation by the German scientist [[Albert Ladenburg]] in 1880, and as various preparations from its plant-based form since antiquity and perhaps prehistoric times. Following the description of the structure and activity of scopolamine by Ladenburg, the search for synthetic analogues of and methods for total synthesis of scopolamine and/or [[atropine]] in the 1930s and 1940s resulted in the discovery of [[diphenhydramine]], an early antihistamine and the prototype of its chemical subclass of these drugs, and [[pethidine]], the first fully synthetic [[opioid]] [[analgesic]], known as Dolatin and Demerol amongst many other trade names.

Scopolamine was used in conjunction with [[morphine]], [[oxycodone]], or other opioids from before 1900 into the 1960s to put mothers in labor into a kind of "[[twilight sleep]]". The analgesia from scopolamine plus a strong opioid is deep enough to allow higher doses to be used as a form of anaesthesia.

Scopolamine mixed with oxycodone (Eukodal) and [[ephedrine]] was marketed by Merck as SEE (from the German initials of the ingredients) and Scophedal starting in 1928, and the mixture is sometimes mixed on site on rare occasions in the area of its greatest historical usage, namely Germany and Central Europe.

Scopolamine was also one of the active ingredients in [[Asthmador]], an over-the-counter (OTC) smoking preparation marketed in the 1950s and 1960s claiming to combat [[asthma]] and [[bronchitis]]. In November 1990, the [[US Food and Drug Administration]] forced OTC products with scopolamine and several hundred other ingredients that had allegedly not been proved effective off the market. Scopolamine shared a small segment of the OTC sleeping pill market with [[diphenhydramine]], [[phenyltoloxamine]], [[pyrilamine]], [[doxylamine]], and other first-generation [[antihistamines]], many of which are still used for this purpose in drugs such as [[Sominex]], [[Tylenol PM]], [[NyQuil]], etc.

===Names===
''Hyoscine hydrobromide'' is the [[international nonproprietary name]], and ''scopolamine hydrobromide'' is the [[United States Adopted Name]]. Other names include ''levo-duboisine'', ''devil's breath'' and ''burundanga''.<ref name="Uribe_et_al_2005">{{cite journal |last1=Uribe-Granja |first1=Manuel |last2=Moreno-López |first2=Claudia L. |last3=Zamora S. |first3=Adriana |last4=Acosta |first4=Pilar J. |title=Perfil epidemiológico de la intoxicación con burundanga en la clínica Uribe Cualla S.

===Recreational use===
While it has been occasionally used recreationally for its hallucinogenic properties, the experiences are often unpleasant, mentally and physically. It is also physically dangerous, so repeated use is rare.<ref>{{cite book |last = Freye |first = E. |title = Pharmacology and Abuse of Cocaine, Amphetamines, Ecstasy and Related Designer Drugs |chapter = Toxicity of Datura Stramonium |publisher = Springer |year = 2010 |location = Netherlands |pages = 217–218 |url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/u42k03r4v3234615/ |isbn = 978-90-481-2447-3 |doi = 10.1007/978-90-481-2448-0_34}}</ref>

===Crime===
In 1910, scopolamine was detected in the remains believed to be those of Cora Crippen, wife of Dr. [[Hawley Harvey Crippen]], and was accepted at the time as the cause of her death, since her husband was known to have bought some at the start of the year.<ref name="Crippen">{{Cite book |editor1-first=Filson |editor1-last=Young |year=1920 |title=The Trial of Hawley Harvey Crippen |series=Notable Trials Series |location=Edinburgh |publisher=William Hodge & Company |page=xxvii; see also evidence, pp. 68–77 |oclc=22125100 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VyVpLjoLpI0C&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=hyoscin |access-date=August 6, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151204003845/https://books.google.com/books?id=VyVpLjoLpI0C&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=hyoscin |archivedate=4 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The drug is known to produce [[anterograde amnesia|loss of memory of events immediately before exposure]] and [[somnolence|sleepiness]], similar to the effect of [[benzodiazepines]] or [[alcohol poisoning]], which affects the ability of a person to resist criminal aggression.  A travel advisory published by the United States Department of State in 2012 stated:<blockquote>One common and particularly dangerous method that criminals use in order to rob a victim is through the use of drugs. The most common [in Colombia] has been scopolamine. Unofficial estimates put the number of annual scopolamine incidents in Colombia at approximately 50,000. Scopolamine can render a victim unconscious for 24 hours or more. In large doses, it can cause respiratory failure and death. It is most often administered in liquid or powder form in foods and beverages. The majority of these incidents occur in night clubs and bars, and usually men, perceived to be wealthy, are targeted by young, attractive women. To avoid becoming a victim of scopolamine, one should never accept food or beverages offered by strangers or new acquaintances or leave food or beverages unattended. Victims of scopolamine or other drugs should seek immediate medical attention.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.osac.gov/Pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=12118 |title=Colombia 2012 Crime and Safety Report: Cartagena |date=March 4, 2012 |publisher=[[Overseas Security Advisory Council]], [[United States Department of State]] |access-date=August 6, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315175638/https://www.osac.gov/Pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=12118 |archivedate=15 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref></blockquote>

== Research ==
Scopolamine has been used as a research tool to study the involvement of acetylcholine in cognition. Results in primates suggest that [[acetylcholine]] is involved in the encoding of new information into long term memory.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ridley, R.
