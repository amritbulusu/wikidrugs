'''Thiamazole''' ([[International nonproprietary name|INN]]) or '''methimazole''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]) is an [[antithyroid agent|antithyroid drug]],<ref name="pmid17389704">{{cite journal |vauthors=Nakamura H, Noh JY, Itoh K, Fukata S, Miyauchi A, Hamada N |title=Comparison of methimazole and propylthiouracil in patients with hyperthyroidism caused by Graves' disease |journal=The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism |volume=92 |issue=6 |pages=2157–62 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17389704 |doi=10.1210/jc.2006-2135 |url=http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17389704}}</ref> and part of the [[thioamide]] group. Like its counterpart [[propylthiouracil]], possible major side effects of treatment include [[agranulocytosis]] and [[hepatitis|liver inflammation]].

==Medical uses==
Thiamazole is a drug used to treat [[hyperthyroidism]] such as in [[Graves' disease]], a condition that occurs when the thyroid gland begins to produce an excess of [[thyroid hormone]]. The drug may also be taken before thyroid surgery to lower thyroid hormone levels and minimize the effects of thyroid manipulation. Additionally, thiamazole is used in the veterinary setting to treat hyperthyroidism in cats.

==Adverse effects==
It is important to monitor any symptoms of fever or sore throat while taking thiamazole; this could indicate the development of [[agranulocytosis]], an uncommon but severe side effect resulting from a drop in the [[white blood cell]] count (to be specific, [[neutropenia]], a deficiency of [[neutrophils]]).  A complete blood count (CBC) with differential is performed to confirm the suspicion, in which case the drug is discontinued.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fumarola|first1=A|last2=Di Fiore|first2=A|last3=Dainelli|first3=M|last4=Grani|first4=G|last5=Calvanese|first5=A|title=Medical treatment of hyperthyroidism: state of the art.|journal=Experimental and Clinical Endocrinology & Diabetes|date=Nov 2010|volume=118|issue=10|pages=678–84|pmid=20496313|doi=10.1055/s-0030-1253420}}</ref>  Administration of recombinant human [[granulocyte colony-stimulating factor]] (rhG-CSF) may increase recovery.

Other known side effects include:
*skin rash 
*itching 
*abnormal hair loss 
*upset stomach 
*vomiting 
*loss of taste 
*abnormal sensations (tingling, prickling, burning, tightness, and pulling) 
*swelling 
*[[arthralgia|joint]] and [[myalgia|muscle pain]] 
*drowsiness 
*dizziness
*decreased platelet count ([[thrombocytopenia]])
*[[aplasia cutis congenita]] (prenatal exposure)
* [[goiter|thyroid gland enlargement]] (prenatal exposure)

==Drug interactions==
Adverse effects may occur for individuals who:
*Take [[anticoagulant]]s ('blood thinners') such as [[warfarin]] (Coumadin), [[diabetes]] medications, [[digoxin]] (Lanoxin), [[theophylline]] (Theobid, Theo-Dur), and vitamins
*Have ever had any blood disease, such as decreased white blood cells (leukopenia), decreased platelets (thrombocytopenia) or aplastic anemia, or liver disease (hepatitis, jaundice)
*Are pregnant, or going to become pregnant, or are [[breastfeeding]].

==Mechanism of action==
Thiamazole inhibits the enzyme [[thyroperoxidase]], which normally acts in thyroid hormone synthesis by oxidizing the anion iodide (I<sup>−</sup>) to iodine (I<sub>2</sub>), hypoiodous acid (HOI), enzyme linked hypoiodate (EOI) facilitating iodine's addition to tyrosine residues on the hormone precursor [[thyroglobulin]], a necessary step in the synthesis of [[triiodothyronine]] (T<sub>3</sub>) and [[thyroxine]] (T<sub>4</sub>).

It does not inhibit the action of the sodium-dependent iodide transporter located on follicular cells' [[basolateral membrane]]s. Inhibition of this step requires competitive inhibitors such as [[perchlorate]] and [[thiocyanate]].

It acts at [[CXCL10]].<ref name="pmid17911406">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Crescioli C, Cosmi L, Borgogni E, etal |title=Methimazole inhibits CXC chemokine ligand 10 secretion in human thyrocytes |journal=J.
