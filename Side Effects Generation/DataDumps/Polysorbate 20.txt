'''Polysorbate 20''' (common commercial brand names include '''Scattics''', '''Alkest TW 20''' and '''Tween 20''') is a [[polysorbate]]-type [[nonionic surfactant]] formed by the [[ethoxylation]] of [[sorbitan]] before the addition of [[lauric acid]]. Its stability and relative nontoxicity allows it to be used as a [[detergent]] and [[emulsifier]] in a number of domestic, scientific, and pharmacological applications. As the name implies the ethoxylation process leaves the molecule with 20 [[repeat unit]]s of [[polyethylene glycol]]; in practice these are distributed across 4 different chains leading to a commercial product containing a range of chemical species.<ref>{{cite journal

==Food applications==
Polysorbate 20 is used as a [[wetting agent]] in flavored mouth drops such as Ice Drops, helping to provide a spreading feeling to other ingredients like [[Denatured alcohol|SD alcohol]] and mint flavor.

The [[World Health Organization]] has suggested acceptable daily intake limits of 0–25&nbsp;mg of polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters per kg body weight.<ref>{{cite web

==Biotechnical applications==
In biological techniques and sciences, polysorbate 20 has a broad range of applications. For example, it is used:
* as a washing agent in [[immunoassay]]s, such as [[Western blot]]s and [[ELISA]]s. It helps to prevent non-specific antibody binding. In this major application, it is dissolved in [[Tris-Buffered Saline]] or [[Phosphate buffered saline]] at dilutions of 0.05% to 0.5% v/v. These buffers are used for washes between each immunoreaction, to remove unbound immunologicals, and eventually for incubating solutions of immunoreagents (labeled antibodies) to reduce unspecific background. 
* to saturate binding sites on surfaces (i.e., to coat polystyrene microplates, generally combined with proteins such as BSA).
* to stabilize proteins [[purified protein derivative]] (PPD) solution used in skin testing for [[tuberculosis]] exposure
* as a solubilizing agent of [[Cell membrane|membrane]] proteins
* for [[lysis|lysing]] mammalian cells, at a concentration of 0.05% to 0.5% v/v, generally combined with other detergents, salts and additives.

==Pharmaceutical applications==
Polysorbate 20 is used as an [[excipient]] in pharmaceutical applications to stabilize [[emulsion]]s and [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]]s.

==Industrial and domestic applications==

Polysorbate 20 is used by [[philatelists]] to remove stamps from envelopes and to remove residues from stamps, without harming the stamp itself.

Polysorbate 20 is also used as wetting agent in rubber balers in the [[elastomer]] industry.

Polysorbate 20 has been used as a shape directing agent to synthesize spheroidal [[magnetite]] nanoassemblies.<ref>Q. Maqbool, C. Singh, A. Paul and A. Srivastava ''J. Mat. Chem. C'', 2015, '''3''', 1610</ref>
