===Sleep disorders===
Armodafinil is approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of [[narcolepsy]] and [[shift work sleep disorder]], and as an [[adjuvant therapy]] for [[obstructive sleep apnea]].<ref name="urlNuvigil (Armodafinil) Drug Information: Uses, Side Effects, Drug Interactions and Warnings at RxList">{{RXlist|nuvigil}}</ref>  For narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea, armodafinil is taken as a once daily 150&nbsp;mg or 250&nbsp;mg dose in the morning. For shift work sleep disorder, 150&nbsp;mg of armodafinil are taken one hour prior to starting work. Slow dose titration is needed to mitigate some side effects.<ref name="urlNuvigil (Armodafinil) Drug Information: Uses, Side Effects, Drug Interactions and Warnings at RxList" />

===Investigational===

====Schizophrenia====
In June, 2010, it was revealed that a phase II study of armodafinil as an adjunctive therapy in adults with [[schizophrenia]] had failed to meet the primary endpoints, and the clinical program was subsequently terminated.<ref name="titleCephalon Provides Clinical Update on Phase II Study of NUVIGIL as an Adjunctive Therapy in Adults with Schizophrenia, ">{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cephalon-provides-clinical-update-on-phase-ii-study-of-nuvigil-as-an-adjunctive-therapy-in-adults-with-schizophrenia-95449199.html|title=Cephalon Provides Clinical Update on Phase II Study of NUVIGIL as an Adjunctive Therapy in Adults with Schizophrenia|accessdate=2011-08-21|work=}}</ref> However, a study published later that year showed that schizophrenic patients treated with armodafinil showed fewer of the [[schizophrenia#Positive and negative|negative symptoms of schizophrenia]].<ref name="Kane 2010">{{Cite journal

==Adverse effects==
In placebo-controlled studies, the most commonly observed side effects were [[headache]], [[xerostomia]] (dry mouth), [[nausea]], [[dizziness]], and [[insomnia]].

Possible side effects also include depression, anxiety, hallucinations, euphoria, extreme increase in activity and talking, anorexia, tremor, thirst, rash, suicidal thoughts, and aggression.

Symptoms of an overdose on armodafinil include trouble sleeping, restlessness, confusion, disorientation, feeling excited, mania, hallucinations, nausea, diarrhea, severely increased or decreased heart beat, chest pain, and increased blood pressure.<ref name="Cephalon 2007"/><ref>http://www.rxlist.com/nuvigil-drug/side-effects-interactions.htm</ref>
<ref>http://armodexperiment.com/?s=dry+mouth</ref>

Serious rashes can develop in rare cases, and require immediate medical attention due to the possibility of [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome|Steven's-Johnson Syndrome]], or other [[Hypersensitivity|hypersensitivites]] to armodafinil.<ref name="Cephalon 2007" />

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
The [[mechanism of action]] of armodafinil is unknown. Armodafinil (''R''-(−)-modafinil) has pharmacological properties almost identical to those of [[modafinil]] (a mixture of ''R''-(−)- and (''S'')-(+)-modafinil). The (''R'')- and (''S'')-enantiomers have similar pharmacological action in animals. Armodafinil has wake-promoting actions similar to [[sympathomimetic agents]] including [[amphetamine]] and [[methylphenidate]], although its pharmacologic profile is not identical to that of the sympathomimetic amines. Armodafinil is an indirect [[dopamine receptor agonist]]; it binds ''in vitro'' to the [[dopamine transporter]] (DAT) and inhibits dopamine reuptake. For modafinil, this activity has been associated ''in vivo'' with increased extracellular dopamine levels. In genetically engineered mice lacking the dopamine transporter, modafinil lacked wake-promoting activity, suggesting that this activity was DAT-dependent. However, the wake-promoting effects of modafinil, unlike those of amphetamine, were not antagonized by the [[dopamine receptor antagonist]] [[haloperidol]] in rats. In addition, [[alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine]], an inhibitor of dopamine synthesis, blocks the action of amphetamine but does not block [[Animal locomotion|locomotor]] activity induced by modafinil.

In addition to its wake-promoting effects and ability to increase locomotor activity in animals, according to Nuvigil prescribing information from manufacturer Cephalon, armodafinil produces [[psychoactive]] and [[euphoria|euphoric]] effects, alterations in mood, perception, thinking, and feelings typical of other [[central nervous system]] (CNS) [[stimulant]]s in humans.<ref name="Cephalon 2007"/> Armodafinil, like racemic modafinil, may also possess reinforcing properties, as evidenced by its self-administration in monkeys previously trained to administer [[cocaine]]; armodafinil was also partially discriminated as stimulant-like. A Cephalon-founded study in which patients were administered modafinil, methylphenidate, and a placebo found that modafinil produces "psychoactive and euphoric effects and feelings consistent with [methylphenidate]."<ref name="Cephalon 2007"/>

===Pharmacokinetics===
Armodafinil exhibits linear time-independent kinetics following single and multiple oral dose administration. Increase in systemic exposure is proportional over the dose range of 50–400&nbsp;mg. No time-dependent change in kinetics was observed through 12 weeks of dosing. Apparent steady state for armodafinil was reached within 7 days of dosing. At steady state, the systemic exposure for armodafinil is 1.8 times the exposure observed after a single dose. The concentration-time profiles of the (''R'')-(−)-enantiomer following a single dose of 50&nbsp;mg Nuvigil or 100&nbsp;mg Provigil (modafinil being a 1:1 mixture of (''R'')-(−)- and (''S'')-(−)- enantiomers) are nearly superimposable. However, the [[Cmax (pharmacology)|C<sub>max</sub>]] of armodafinil at steady state was 37% higher following administration of 200&nbsp;mg Nuvigil than the corresponding value of modafinil following administration of 200&nbsp;mg Provigil due to the more rapid clearance of the (''S'')-(+)-enantiomer.

====Absorption====
Armodafinil is readily absorbed after oral administration. The absolute oral bioavailability was not determined due to the aqueous insolubility of armodafinil, which precluded [[intravenous]] administration. Peak plasma concentrations are attained at approximately 2 hours in the fasted state. Food effect on the overall bioavailability of armodafinil is considered minimal; however, time to reach peak concentration may be delayed 2–4 hours in the fed state. Since the delay in [[Cmax (pharmacology)|T<sub>max</sub>]] is also associated with elevated plasma concentration later in time, food can potentially affect the onset and time course of pharmacologic action of armodafinil.
