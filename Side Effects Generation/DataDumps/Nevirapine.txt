==Medical uses==
Nevirapine is used in adults and in children 6 years of age infected with HIV-1 as part of combination antiretroviral treatment (ART or cART). Mono treatment use of nevirapine is not indicated due to increased risk of resistance.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/020636s044,020933s035lbl.pdf|title=Product Information: VIRAMUNE(R)XR oral extended-release tablets, nevirapine oral extended-release tablets.|first=|date=2011|website=|publisher=Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Ridgefield, CT, 2011.|language=en|access-date=2016-11-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106125656/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/020636s044,020933s035lbl.pdf|archivedate=2016-11-06|df=}}</ref>

Nevirapine in triple combination therapy has been shown to suppress [[viral load]] effectively when used as initial antiretroviral therapy (''i.e.'', in antiretroviral-naive patients).<ref name="INCAS_1998" /> Some clinical trials have demonstrated comparable HIV suppression with nevirapine-based regimens to that achieved with [[protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitors]] (PIs)<ref>{{cite journal|date=May 2003|title=A randomized trial to study first-line combination therapy with or without a protease inhibitor in HIV-1-infected patients|journal=AIDS|volume=17|issue=7|pages=987–99|doi=10.1097/00002030-200305020-00007|pmid=12700448|vauthors=van Leeuwen R, Katlama C, Murphy RL}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=A randomized clinical trial comparing nelfinavir or nevirapine associated to zidovudine/lamivudine in HIV-infected naive patients (the Combine Study)|journal=Antiviral Therapy|volume=7|pages=81–90|vauthors=Podzamczer D, Ferrer E, Consiglio E}}</ref> or [[efavirenz]].<ref name="2NN">{{cite journal|date=Mar 2005|title=The effect of baseline CD4 cell count and HIV-1 viral load on the efficacy and safety of nevirapine or efavirenz-based first-line HAART|journal=AIDS|volume=19|issue=5|pages=463–71|doi=10.1097/01.aids.0000162334.12815.5b|pmid=15764851|vauthors=van Leth F, Andrews S, Grinsztejn B}}</ref>

This drug is generally only to be considered for used in HIV-1 infected population once CD4 cell counts are very low.<ref name=":0" />

Although concerns have been raised about nevirapine-based regimens in those starting therapy with high viral load or low CD4 count, some analyses suggest that nevirapine may be effective in this group of people.<ref name="2NN" />

Nevirapine may also form a useful component of salvage regimens after virological failure, usually in combination with one or more PIs as well as [[nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor]] (NRTIs), especially in those who have not previously taken an NNRTI.

Dosing in children is based on [[Body surface area|body surface area (BSA)]],<ref name=":0" /> however, weight based dosing algorithms have been released.

Cases of [[immune reconstitution syndrome]] and [[Lipodystrophy|fat redistribution]] have also been observed with this drug.<ref name=":1" />

U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends stopping nevirapine if a person experiencing:<ref name=":1" />
* sign and symptoms of liver issues such as [[hepatitis]]
* increased [[Elevated transaminases|transaminases]] in addition to rash or systemic symptoms
* formation of rash with systemic symptoms
* severe skin or hypersensitivity reactions
Additionally, U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] recommends monitoring closely for first 6 weeks of therapy for above symptoms as there is high risk during this time. Monitor for up to the first 18 weeks of treatment and if a patient experiences 1) hepatitis plus rash or other systemic symptoms or 2) severe hypersensitivity or skin rash, nervirapine should not be restarted.<ref name=":1" />

==Drug interactions==
Nevirapine is a substrate for liver [[CYP3A]] and [[CYP2B6]] enzymes. Concomitant administration of drugs that are inhibitors of these enzymes may increase serum nevirapine levels significantly. Some examples of these drugs include [[ritonavir]], [[fosamprenavir]], and [[fluconazole]]. On the other hand, drugs that are inducers of these enzymes such as [[rifampicin]] may lower serum nevirapine levels.<ref name=":02">{{Cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/201152s004lbl.pdf|title=VIRAMUNE® (nevirapine) Prescribing Information|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108141845/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/201152s004lbl.pdf|archivedate=2016-11-08|df=}}</ref><sup>[[Nevirapine#cite note-PInfo-18|[18]]]</sup>

In addition, concomitant use of  [[Hypericum perforatum|St. John's wort]] ''(Hypericum perforatum)'' or St. John's wort containing products may significantly lower nevirapine levels.<ref name=":02" />

Nevirapine is an inducer of [[Cytochrome P450 oxidase|cytochrome P450]] isoenzymes [[CYP3A4]] and [[CYP2B6]]. It may reduce levels of several co-administered drugs including the antiretrovirals [[efavirenz]], [[indinavir]], [[lopinavir]], [[nelfinavir]] and [[saquinavir]], as well as [[clarithromycin]], [[ketoconazole]], forms of [[hormonal contraception]], and [[methadone]].<ref name=PInfo/>

==Mechanism of action==
[[File:Nevirapine 3D.png|thumb|left|Nevirapine shown in ball and stick structure.]]
Nevirapine falls in the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) class of antiretrovirals.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Patel SS, Benfield P |title=New drug profile: nevirapine |journal=Clinical Immunotherapeutics |volume=6|issue=4|pages=307–317 |date=Oct 1996 |pmid=|pmc=|doi=}}</ref>  Both nucleoside and non-nucleoside RTIs inhibit the same target, the [[reverse transcriptase]] enzyme, an essential viral enzyme which transcribes viral RNA into DNA. Unlike [[Nucleoside analogue|nucleoside]] RTIs, which bind at the polymerase active site, NNRTIs bind to a hydrophobic pocket in the subdomain of p66 which is about 10 angstrom away from the active site (known as the NNRTI pocket). Therefore, this NNRTI-binding pocket will inhibit reverse transcription in a way that is distinct to the NRTIs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schauer|first=Grant D.|last2=Huber|first2=Kelly D.|last3=Leuba|first3=Sanford H.|last4=Sluis-Cremer|first4=Nicolas|date=2014-10-13|title=Mechanism of allosteric inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase revealed by single-molecule and ensemble fluorescence|url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/42/18/11687|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|language=en|volume=42|issue=18|pages=11687–11696|doi=10.1093/nar/gku819|issn=0305-1048|pmc=4191400|pmid=25232099}}</ref>
