'''Oxiracetam''' (developmental code name '''ISF 2522''') is a [[nootropic]] drug of the [[racetam]] family and very mild [[stimulant]].<ref>{{Cite journal

==Clinical findings==
There has been effort put into investigating the possible use of oxiracetam as a medication to attenuate the symptoms of dementia.<ref name="Gouliaev">{{Cite journal

}}</ref> However, no convincing results were obtained from studies where patients suffering from [[Alzheimer's dementia]] or organic solvent abuse were given 800&nbsp;mg of the drug orally twice daily.<ref name="Gouliaev"/>

The proven effects of the drug are limited to beneficial effects that lead to higher scores in tests for logical performance, attention, concentration, memory and spatial orientation. These tests were performed on patients with mild to moderate dementia and ADHD, and the doses were 800–2400&nbsp;mg orally twice a day for one to six months. Improvement has also been seen in patients with exogenic post-concussion syndrome, organic brain syndromes and other dementias. According to V. Gallai ''et al'', oxiracetam is more effective than piracetam for this purpose.<ref name="Gouliaev"/>

Research shows oxiracetam improves hippocampally-mediated learning performance by increasing membrane-bound [[protein kinase C]] (PKC). When compared to control mice, oxiracetam-treated DBA mice demonstrated a significant increase in spatial learning performance as determined by the [[Morris water navigation task]]. This increase in performance was correlated to an increase in membrane-bound PKC.<ref>{{cite journal|authors=Fordyce DE, Clark VJ, Paylor R, Wehner JM|title=Enhancement of hippocampally-mediated learning and protein kinase C activity by oxiracetam in learning impaired DBA/2 mice|journal=Brain Res.|date=February 1995|pmid=7749739|volume=672|issue=1–2|pages=170–6|doi=10.1016/0006-8993(94)01389-y}}</ref>

Oxiracetam acts also as a [[positive allosteric modulator]] of the AMPA receptors.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} The major metabolites of Oxiracetam include: beta-hydroxy-[[2-pyrrolidone]], N-aminoacetyl-[[GABOB]], GABOB (beta-hydroxy-GABA) and [[glycine]]. Thus its metabolic route is exactly parallel to that of [[piracetam]], [[aniracetam]], [[phenylpiracetam]], and all other members of the -racetam family, and also [[pyroglutamic acid]].

==Pharmacokinetics==
Oxiracetam is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with a bioavailability of 56-82%.<ref name="Gouliaev"/>
Peak serum levels are reached within one to three hours after a single 800&nbsp;mg or 2000&nbsp;mg oral dose, with the maximal serum concentration reaching between 19-31&nbsp;µg/ml at these doses.

Oxiracetam is mainly cleared renally and approximately 84% is excreted unchanged in the urine.
The half-life of oxiracetam in healthy individuals is about 8 hours, whereas it is 10–68 hours in patients with renal impairment.
There is some penetration of the [[blood–brain barrier]] with brain concentrations reaching 5.3% of those in the blood (measured one hour after a single 2000&nbsp;mg intravenous dose).<ref name="Gouliaev"/>

Clearance rates range from 9 to 95 ml/min and steady-state concentrations when 800&nbsp;mg is given twice daily range from 60 µM to 530 µM.

The highest brain concentrations of oxiracetam are found in the [[septum pellucidum]], followed by the [[hippocampus]], the [[cerebral cortex]] and with the lowest concentrations in the striatum after a 200&nbsp;mg/kg oral dose given to rats.<ref name="Gouliaev"/> Oxiracetam may be quantitated in plasma, serum or urine by liquid chromatography with one of several different detection techniques.<ref>R.
