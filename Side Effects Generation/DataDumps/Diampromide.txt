'''Diampromide''' is an [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] from the ampromide family of drugs, related to other drugs such as [[propiram]]. It was invented in the 1960s by American Cyanamid,<ref>US Patent 2944081</ref> and can be described as a ring-opened analogue of [[fentanyl]].[http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/ectoc/echet98/pub/028/index.htm]

Diampromide produces similar effects to other opioids, including [[analgesia]], [[sedation]], [[dizziness]] and [[nausea]], and is around the same potency as [[morphine]].<ref>Ivanovic MD, Micovic IV, Vuckovic S, Prostran M, Todorovic Z, Ivanovic ER, Kiricojevic VD, Djordjevic JB, Dosen-Micovic LJ.  The synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of 2,3-seco-fentanyl analogues. ''Journal of the Serbian Chemical Society''. 2004; 69(11): 955-968.</ref>

Diampromide is in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act 1970 of the United States as a Narcotic with ACSCN 9615 with a zero aggregate manufacturing quota as of 2014. <ref>http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/quotas/2014/fr0825.htm</ref>  It is listed under the Single Convention for the Control of Narcotic Substances 1961 and is controlled in most countries in the same fashion as is morphine. It is highly poisonous.
