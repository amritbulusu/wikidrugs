'''Moxetumomab pasudotox''' is an anti-CD22 mouse monoclonal antibody designed for the treatment of cancer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Statement On A Nonproprietary Name Adopted By The USAN Council: Moxetumomab Pasudotox|publisher=[[American Medical Association]]|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/usan/moxetumomab-pasudotox.pdf}}</ref>

Moxetumomab pasudotox is currently being developed by the biologics division of [[AstraZeneca]], [[MedImmune]].

On 16 May 2013, the first dose in a Phase III trial was administered.<ref name="bloomberg.com">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-16/astrazeneca-advances-three-cancer-drugs-into-late-stage-trials.html</ref><ref>https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/16/us-cancer-astrazeneca-idUSBRE94F0DU20130516</ref>

== Discovery and Ownership Background ==

On the 1 November 2005 [[Cambridge Antibody Technology]] announced it was acquiring two [[anti-CD22 immunotoxin]] products from [[Genencor]], namely GCR-3888 and GCR-8015.<ref name="prnewswire.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/11-01-2005/0004204747&EDATE= |title=Cambridge Antibody Technology Acquires Oncology Product Candidates from Genencor |publisher=Prnewswire.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-12}}</ref> [[Genencor]] is the [[biotechnology]] division of [[Danisco]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danisco.com/cms/connect/corporate/about+danisco/organisation/divisions/genencor/genencor_en.htm |accessdate=August 12, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107000935/http://www.danisco.com/cms/connect/corporate/about+danisco/organisation/divisions/genencor/genencor_en.htm |archivedate=January 7, 2009 }}</ref> and the acquisition meant CAT would hire certain former Genencor key employees to be responsible for the development of the programmes.<ref>[http://www.danisco.com/cms/connect/corporate/media%20relations/news/archive/2005/november/investor_182_en.htm ]{{dead link|date=May 2010}}</ref>

GCR-3888 and GCR-8015 were discovered and initially developed by the [[National Cancer Institute]], which is part of the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]].  Genencor licensed the candidates for [[hematological malignancies]] and entered into a [[Cooperative Research and Development Agreement]] (CRADA) with the NIH, which will now be continued by CAT.  Under the original
license agreement with the NIH, CAT gained the rights to a portfolio of intellectual property associated with the programs and would pay future royalties to the NIH.

CAT intended to file an [[Investigational New Drug]] (IND) application for GCR-8015 in various CD22 positive B-cell malignancies, including [[Non-Hodgkin lymphoma]] and [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]], following a period of manufacturing development which is expected to be complete by the end of 2006 and to support the NCI's ongoing development of GCR-3888 in [[Hairy cell leukemia]] (HCL) and pediatric [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] (pALL).<ref name="prnewswire.com"/>

CAT-8015 exhibited a greater affinity for CD22 than its predecessor, CAT-3888<ref>{{cite web|url=http://press.nci.nih.gov/Templates/drugdictionary.aspx?CdrID=540032 |title=News Releases - National Cancer Institute |publisher=Press.nci.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-05-12}}</ref> and CAT's language such as "CAT will support the NCI's ongoing development of CAT-3888..." suggested at the time that their focus was on the second generation candidate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-4981435/Cambridge-Antibody-Technology-Announces-Preliminary.html |title=Cambridge Antibody Technology Announces Preliminary Results for the Year Ended 30 September 2005. &#124; Goliath Business News |publisher=Goliath.ecnext.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-12}}</ref>

CAT was acquired by [[AstraZeneca]], who also acquired MedImmune, combining the two into a biologics division. MedImmune renamed CAT-8015 to Moxetumumab Pasudotox.<ref>http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/usan/moxetumomab-pasudotox.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.ukmi.nhs.uk/applications/ndo/record_view_open.asp?newDrugID=5997</ref>

On the 16 May 2013, [[AstraZeneca]] announced that CAT-8015 had started Phase III clinical trials.<ref name="bloomberg.com"/>
