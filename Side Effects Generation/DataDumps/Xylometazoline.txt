==Mechanism of action==
The drug works by stimulating [[adrenergic receptors]] on the [[lamina propria]] of [[blood vessel]]s in the nose. The decongestant effect is due to [[Vasoconstriction|constriction]] of large veins in the nose which swell up during the inflammation of any infection or allergy of the nose. The smaller arteries are also constricted and this causes the colour of the nasal [[epithelium]] to be visibly paler after dosage.

Xylometazoline is an [[imidazole]] derivative which is designed to mimic the molecular shape of [[adrenaline]]. It binds to [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>]] and [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>2</sub>]] adrenergic receptors<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Haenisch | first1 = B. | last2 = Walstab | first2 = J. | last3 = Herberhold | first3 = S. | last4 = Bootz | first4 = F. | last5 = Tschaikin | first5 = M. | last6 = Ramseger | first6 = R. | last7 = Bönisch | first7 = H. | title = Alpha-adrenoceptor Agonistic Activity of Oxymetazoline and Xylometazoline | journal = Fundamental & Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 24 | issue = 6 | pages = 729–39 | year = 2009 | pmid = 20030735 | doi = 10.1111/j.1472-8206.2009.00805.x}}</ref> in the nasal mucosa. Due to its [[sympathomimetic]] effects, it should not be used by people with high [[blood pressure]], or other [[heart]] problems.

Extended usage of xylometazoline can result in decreased effectiveness or a buildup of tolerance against the drug.<ref>[http://www.harrisonspractice.com/practice/ub?cmd=ref&style.cp=421620&style.cpa=0 Gold Standard Clinical Pharmacology<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The number of receptors decreases, and when the administration of the drug is ceased, chronic congestion can occur; this is called [[rhinitis medicamentosa]], commonly referred to as rebound congestion. Moreover, long-term overdosing can cause degenerative changes in nasal [[mucous membrane]]s that pose another health problem.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}
