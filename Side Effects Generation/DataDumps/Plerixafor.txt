'''Plerixafor''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]] and [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]], trade name '''Mozobil''') is an [[immunostimulant]] used to mobilize [[hematopoietic stem cell]]s in cancer patients into the bloodstream. The stem cells are then extracted from the blood and [[Autologous stem cell transplantation|transplanted back]] to the patient. The drug was developed by [[AnorMED]] which was subsequently bought by [[Genzyme]].

==Medical uses==
Peripheral blood stem cell mobilization, which is important as a source of [[hematopoietic stem cells]] for [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|transplantation]], is generally performed using [[granulocyte colony-stimulating factor]] (G-CSF), but is ineffective in around 15 to 20% of patients. Combination of G-CSF with plerixafor increases the percentage of persons that respond to the therapy and produce enough stem cells for transplantation.<ref name="DrugsRD">{{Cite journal | title = Plerixafor | journal = Drugs in R & D | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 113–119 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.2165/00126839-200708020-00006| pmid = 17324009}}</ref> The drug is approved for patients with [[lymphoma]] and [[multiple myeloma]].<ref name="AustriaCodex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2009|edition=2009/2010|isbn=3-85200-196-X|language=German}}</ref>

==Contraindications==

===Pregnancy and lactation===
Studies in pregnant animals have shown [[teratogenic]] effects. Plerixafor is therefore contraindicated in pregnant women except in critical cases. Fertile women are required to use [[contraception]]. It is not known whether the drug is secreted into the breast milk. Breast feeding should be discontinued during therapy.<ref name="AustriaCodex" />

==Adverse effects==
[[Nausea]], [[diarrhea]] and local reactions were observed in over 10% of patients. Other problems with digestion and general symptoms like dizziness, headache, and muscular pain are also relatively common; they were found in more than 1% of patients. Allergies occur in less than 1% of cases. Most adverse effects in clinical trials were mild and transient.<ref name="AustriaCodex" /><ref name="Wagstaff">{{Cite journal | last1 = Wagstaff | first1 = A.

The [[European Medicines Agency]] has listed a number of safety concerns to be evaluated on a post-marketing basis, most notably the theoretical possibilities of [[spleen]] rupture and tumor cell mobilisation. The first concern has been raised because [[splenomegaly]] was observed in animal studies, and G-CSF can cause spleen rupture in rare cases. Mobilisation of tumor cells has occurred in patients with leukaemia treated with plerixafor.<ref name="CHMP">{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Public_assessment_report/human/001030/WC500030689.pdf|publisher=[[European Medicines Agency]]|title=CHMP Assessment Report for Mozobil}}</ref>

==Interactions==
No interaction studies have been conducted. The fact that plerixafor does not interact with the cytochrome system indicates a low potential for interactions with other drugs.<ref name="AustriaCodex" />

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
In the form of its zinc complex, plerixafor acts as an [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]] (or perhaps more accurately a [[partial agonist]]) of the alpha [[chemokine receptor]] [[CXCR4]] and an [[allosteric]] agonist of [[CXCR7]].<ref>{{Cite journal

The CXCR4 alpha-[[chemokine]] receptor and one of its [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]]s, [[SDF-1 (biology)|SDF-1]], are important in [[hematopoietic stem cell]] homing to the [[bone marrow]] and in [[hematopoietic stem cell]] [[G0 phase|quiescence]]. The ''[[in vivo]]'' effect of plerixafor with regard to [[ubiquitin]], the alternative endogenous ligand of CXCR4, is unknown. Plerixafor has been found to be a strong inducer of mobilization of [[hematopoietic stem cells]] from the bone marrow to the bloodstream as [[peripheral blood stem cells]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Cashen | first1 = A.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Following [[subcutaneous injection]], plerixafor is absorbed quickly and peak concentrations are reached after 30 to 60 minutes. Up to 58% are bound to plasma proteins, the rest mostly resides in [[extravascular compartment]]s. The drug is not [[metabolized]] in significant amounts; no interaction with the [[cytochrome P450]] enzymes or [[P-glycoprotein]]s has been found. Plasma half life is 3 to 5 hours. Plerixafor is excreted via the [[kidney]]s, with 70% of the drug being excreted within 24 hours.<ref name="AustriaCodex" />

==Chemistry==
Plerixafor is a [[macrocyclic compound]] and a bi[[cyclam]] derivative, the cyclam rings being linked at the amine nitrogen atoms by a 1,4-[[xylyl]] spacer.<ref name="DrugsRD" /> It is a strong [[base (chemistry)|base]]; all eight nitrogen atoms accept [[proton]]s readily. The two macrocyclic rings form [[chelate complex]]es with bivalent metal ions, especially [[zinc]], [[copper]] and [[nickel]], as well as  [[cobalt]] and [[rhodium]]. The biologically active form of plerixafor is its zinc complex.<ref>{{Cite journal

===Synthesis===
Three of the four nitrogen atoms of the macrocycle cyclam (1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane) are protected with [[tosyl]] groups. The product is treated with 1,4-bis(brommethyl)benzene and [[potassium carbonate]] in [[acetonitrile]]. After cleaving of the tosyl groups with [[hydrobromic acid]], plerixafor octahydrobromide is obtained.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bridger|first1=G.|year=1993|title=Linked cyclic polyamines with activity against HIV.

==Society and culture==

===Legal status===
Plerixafor has [[orphan drug]] status in the United States and European Union for the mobilization of [[hematopoietic stem cells]]. It was approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] for this indication on 15 December 2008.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.prescribingreference.com/news/showNews/which/MozobilApprovedForNonHodgkinsLymphomaAndMultipleMyeloma121801 |title= Mozobil approved for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and multiple myeloma |date=December 18, 2008 |publisher=''Monthly Prescribing Reference''| accessdate=January 3, 2009}}</ref> In Europe, the drug was approved after a positive [[Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use]] assessment report on 29 May 2009.<ref name="CHMP" /> The drug was approved for use in Canada by [[Health Canada]] on 8 December 2011.<ref>[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/prodpharma/sbd-smd/drug-med/nd_ad_2012_mozobil_142638-eng.php Notice of Decision for MOZOBIL]</ref>

==Research==

===Small molecule cancer therapy===
Plerixafor was seen to reduce metastasis in mice in several studies.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = M. C. P. | last2 = Luker | first2 = K. E. | last3 = Garbow | first3 = J.

===Use in generation of other stem cells===
Researchers at Imperial College have demonstrated that plerixafor in combination with [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF) can produce [[mesenchymal stem cells]] and [[endothelial progenitor cell]]s in mice.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Pitchford | first1 = S. | last2 = Furze | first2 = R. | last3 = Jones | first3 = C. | last4 = Wengner | first4 = A. | last5 = Rankin | first5 = S. | title = Differential Mobilization of Subsets of Progenitor Cells from the Bone Marrow | journal = Cell Stem Cell | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 62–72 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19128793 | doi = 10.1016/j.stem.2008.10.017}}</ref>
