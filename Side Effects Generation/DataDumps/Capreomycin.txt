==Spectrum of susceptibility==
Capreomycin is most commonly used to treat ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' infections. ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' growth has been found to be inhibited at a concentration of 2.5 Î¼g/mL.<ref>http://www.toku-e.com/Assets/MIC/Capreomycin%20sulfate.pdf</ref>

== Side effects ==
High incidence: hematuria, urine output or urinary frequency significantly increased or decreased, loss of appetite or extreme thirst (hypokalemia, renal toxicity).

Less incidence: hearing loss, tinnitus, gait instability, dizziness, dyspnea, lethargy, extreme weakness (neuromuscular block, Renal toxicity, hypokalemia), nausea or vomiting.

Significant renal toxicity: creatinine, elevated urea nitrogen, poor creatinine clearance, proteinuria, tubular urine (need monitoring of renal function and urine routine during using this medicine.

Damage on the 8th brain nerve. There can be vestibular dysfunction and a little hearing damage after using the medication for 2 to 4 months.

A certain block effect of neuromuscular.

Can cause allergic reactions: rash, drug fever, facial flushing or pale, asthma, palpitations, sense of suppression in the chest, abdominal pain, anaphylactic shock.

== Interactions ==
Combined with aminoglycosides: can increase the possibility of ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity and neuromuscular block, result in hearing loss. Can continue to deafness. It could be a temporary symptom, but often be permanent. Neuromuscular blockade can lead to skeletal muscle weakness and respiratory depression or paralysis (apnea). Using anti-cholinesterase or calcium salts may release this block.

Combined with amphotericin B, vancomycin, bacitracin, paromomycin, cyclosporine, kanamycin, cisplatin, bumetanide, etoric acid, furosemide: Would Increase the possibility of ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity.

Combined with antihistamines, buclizine, seyclizine, meclozine, phenothiazines, thioketones, trimethamine, and capreomycin: cover up the symptoms of tinnitus, dizziness or vertigo and other ototoxic symptoms.

Combined with anti-neuromuscular block drugs: can antagonize the effect of the anti-neuromuscular block drugs on the skeletal muscle (so need to adjust the dose of the drugs for anti-muscle weakness.

Combined with ethyl sulfide isoniazid: may increase the side effects.

Combined with methoxyflurane or polymyxin injection: may increase renal toxicity or neuromuscular blockade effect.

Combined with opioid: The effect of central respiratory inhibition may increase, lead to prolonged respiratory inhibition or respiratory paralysis (apnea).

== History ==
Capreomycin, an antiphlogistic antibiotic which was produced in USA in 1960, and be applied in clinic in 1968. In 1979, capreomycin was used in the are of antituberculosis by inhibiting the growth of mycobacterium tuberculosis.
