'''Aminoglutethimide''' is an anti-[[steroid]] drug marketed under the tradename '''Cytadren''' by [[Novartis]] around the world. It blocks the production of steroids derived from [[cholesterol]] and is clinically used in the treatment of [[Cushing's syndrome]]<ref name="pmid17961023">{{cite journal |vauthors =Gross BA, Mindea SA, Pick AJ, Chandler JP, Batjer HH |title=Medical management of Cushing disease |journal=Neurosurgical focus |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=E10 |year=2007 |pmid=17961023 |doi=10.3171/foc.2007.23.3.12 |url=http://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/foc.2007.23.3.12?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dncbi.nlm.nih.gov}}</ref> and metastatic [[breast cancer]]. It is also used by [[bodybuilding|bodybuilders]].

==Mechanism==
Aminoglutethimide has two mechanisms of action:

# It blocks [[aromatase]]<ref name="pmid17602675">{{cite journal |vauthors =Siraki AG, Bonini MG, Jiang J, Ehrenshaft M, Mason RP |title=Aminoglutethimide-induced protein free radical formation on myeloperoxidase: a potential mechanism of agranulocytosis |journal=[[Chemical research in toxicology]] |volume=20 |issue=7 |pages=1038–45 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17602675 |pmc=2073000 |doi=10.1021/tx6003562}}</ref> in the generation of [[estrogens]] from [[androstenedione]] and [[testosterone]].
# It blocks the conversion of cholesterol to [[pregnenolone]] by inhibiting the enzyme [[P450scc]] and consequently decreases synthesis of all hormonally active [[steroids]].

At low doses, aminogluthethimide is only an effective inhibitor of aromatase, but at higher doses, it effectively blocks P450scc as well.

==Side effects==
Its side effects are skin rash, [[hepatotoxicity]], inhibition of [[cortisol]] in the human body, and it may also cause [[hypothyroidism]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}. Since cortisol helps break down [[muscle]], aminoglutethimide is used by [[bodybuilders]] in a [[steroid cycle]].

==Clinical uses==
Aminoglutethimide is indicated in conjunction with other drugs for the suppression of [[adrenal]] function in patients with [[Cushing's syndrome]].

It is also a 2nd or 3rd line choice for the treatment of [[hormone]] sensitive ([[estrogen]] and [[progesterone]]) [[metastatic]] [[breast cancer]].

==Abuse==
Aminoglutethimide is abused by bodybuilders and other steroid users to lower circulating levels of cortisol in the body and prevent muscle loss. Cortisol is [[catabolic]] to protein in muscle and effective blockade of P450scc by aminogluthethimide at high doses prevents muscle loss.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Aminoglutethimide has more recently found use as a recreational [[CYP2D6]] inducer, resulting in an increased conversion of [[codeine]] to [[morphine]] when the former is taken concomitantly with aminoglutethimide. This increases the effect of codeine per dose and increases the ceiling effect threshold, allowing smaller doses of codeine to achieve the same effect as a larger dose taken alone as well as increasing the metabolic limit on the effect of codeine (normally codeine doses above 400&nbsp;mg stop producing any significant increase in opioid effects due to depletion of the CYP2D6 enzyme which essentially halts the conversion process until the enzyme has replenished). A similar effect is seen with [[tramadol]] due to an increased conversion to [[O-desmethyltramadol]] and an increased availability of the CYP2D6 enzyme.
