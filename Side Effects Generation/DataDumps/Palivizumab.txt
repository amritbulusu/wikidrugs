'''Palivizumab''' (brand name '''Synagis''' which is manufactured by [[MedImmune]]) is a [[monoclonal antibody]] produced by recombinant DNA technology. It is used in the prevention of [[respiratory syncytial virus]] (RSV) infections. It is recommended for infants that are high-risk because of prematurity or other medical problems such as congenital heart disease.

Palivizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG) directed against an epitope in the A antigenic site of the F protein of RSV.  In two Phase III clinical trials in the pediatric population, palivizumab reduced the risk of hospitalization due to RSV infection by 55% and 45%.  Palivizumab is dosed once a month via intramuscular (IM) injection, to be administered throughout the duration of the RSV season.<ref>http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2002/palimed102302LB.pdf</ref>

Palivizumab targets the fusion protein of RSV,<ref>Levinson, Wilson.  "Medical Microbiology and Immunology, 8th ed."  Lange: 2004. p. 430.</ref> inhibiting its entry into the cell and thereby preventing infection. Palivizumab was approved for medical use in 1998.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Long|first1=Sarah S.|last2=Pickering|first2=Larry K.|last3=Prober|first3=Charles G.|title=Principles and Practice of Pediatric Infectious Disease|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=1437727026|page=1502|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=nQ7-o8JAH7kC&pg=PA1502|language=en}}</ref>

== Medical use==

Palivizumab is used to reduce the risk of [[respiratory syncytial virus]] in children at increased risk of severe disease.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Updated Guidance for Palivizumab Prophylaxis Among Infants and Young Children at Increased Risk of Hospitalization for Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection|url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/07/23/peds.2014-1665|journal = Pediatrics|date = 2014-07-01|issn = 0031-4005|pmid = 25070315|pages = peds.2014–1665|doi = 10.1542/peds.2014-1665|language = en|first = Committee on Infectious Diseases and Bronchiolitis Guidelines|last = Committee|volume=134}}</ref> Since the beginning of the drug's, the American Academy of Pediatrics
has updated its guidance for the use of palivizumab 4 times as
additional data became available to provide a better understanding of
infants and young children at greatest risk of hospitalization attributable
to RSV infection. The updated recommendations in this policy
statement reflect new information regarding the seasonality of RSV
circulation, palivizumab pharmacokinetics, the changing incidence of
[[bronchiolitis]] hospitalizations, the effect of [[gestational age]] and other risk
factors on RSV hospitalization rates, the mortality of children hospitalized
with RSV infection, the effect of [[Preventive healthcare|prophylaxis]] on wheezing, and
palivizumab-resistant RSV isolates. This policy statement updates and
replaces the recommendations found in the 2012 Red Book. Pediatrics
2014;134:415–420<ref>{{cite journal|title=Updated Guidance for Palivizumab Prophylaxis Among Infants and Young Children at Increased Risk of Hospitalization for Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection|doi=10.1542/peds.2014-1665 | volume=134 | journal=Pediatrics|pages=415–420|pmid=25070315}}</ref>

Infants younger than one year with [[bronchopulmonary dysplasia]] (i.e. who were born at <32 weeks gestation and required supplemental oxygen for the first 28 days after birth) and infants younger than two years with bronchopulmonary dysplasia who required medical therapy (e.g. supplemental oxygen, glucocorticoids, diuretics) within six months of the anticipated RSV season are recommended to use palivizumab as prophylaxis. Also, infants younger than one year who were born at <29 weeks (i.e. ≤28 weeks, 6 days) of gestation are recommended to use palivizumab.

Other potential target groups for palivizumab prophylaxis include:<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Revised Indications for the Use of Palivizumab and Respiratory Syncytial Virus Immune Globulin Intravenous for the Prevention of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections|url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/112/6/1442|journal = Pediatrics|date = 2003-12-01|issn = 0031-4005|pmid = 14654627|pages = 1442–1446|volume = 112|issue = 6|language = en|first = Committee on Infectious Diseases and Committee on Fetus and|last = Newborn|doi=10.1542/peds.112.6.1442}}</ref>
* Infants younger than one year of age with hemodynamically significant [[Congenital heart defect|congenital heart disease]].
* Children younger than one year of age with [[Neuromuscular disease|neuromuscular disorders]] impairing the ability to clear secretions from the upper [[Respiratory tract|airways]] or [[Congenital pulmonary airway malformation|pulmonary abnormalities]].
* Children younger than two years of age who are [[Immunodeficiency|immunocompromised]] (e.g. those with severe combined immunodeficiency; those younger than two years of age who have undergone [[lung transplantation]] or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) during the [[Human respiratory syncytial virus|RSV]] season.
* Children with [[Down syndrome]] who have additional risk factors for lower [[respiratory tract infection]]s.
* Alaska native and American Indian infants.
Decisions regarding palivizumab prophylaxis for children in these groups should be made on a case-by-case basis.

== Side effects ==
Palivizumab use may cause side effects, which include, but are not limited to:<ref>{{Cite web|title = Palivizumab Injection: MedlinePlus Drug Information|url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a698034.html|website = www.nlm.nih.gov|access-date = 2016-01-30}}</ref>
* [[Sore throat]]
* [[Rhinorrhea|Runny nose]]
* [[Erythema|Redness or irritation at injection site]]
* [[Vomiting]]
* [[Diarrhea]]
Some more serious side effects include:
* Severe skin [[rash]]
