'''Testosterone''' is the primary male [[sex hormone]] and an [[anabolic steroid]].  In male humans, testosterone plays a key role in the development of [[Male reproductive system|male reproductive]] tissues such as the testis and [[prostate]], as well as promoting [[secondary sexual characteristic]]s such as increased [[muscle]] and [[bone]] mass, and the growth of [[androgenic hair|body hair]].<ref name="Mooradian_ 1987">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mooradian AD, Morley JE, Korenman SG | title = Biological actions of androgens | journal = Endocrine Reviews | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–28 | date = Feb 1987 | pmid = 3549275 | doi = 10.1210/edrv-8-1-1 }}</ref> In addition, testosterone is involved in health and well-being,<ref name="pmid19707253">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bassil N, Alkaade S, Morley JE | title = The benefits and risks of testosterone replacement therapy: a review | journal = Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 427–48 | date = Jun 2009 | pmid = 19707253 | pmc = 2701485 | doi =  }}</ref> and the prevention of [[osteoporosis]].<ref name="pmid19011293">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tuck SP, Francis RM | title = Testosterone, bone and osteoporosis | journal = Frontiers of Hormone Research | volume = 37 | issue =  | pages = 123–32 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19011293 | doi = 10.1159/000176049 | isbn = 978-3-8055-8622-1 | series = Frontiers of Hormone Research }}</ref> Insufficient levels of testosterone in men may lead to abnormalities including frailty and bone loss.

Testosterone is a [[steroid]] from the [[androstane]] class containing a [[ketone|keto]] and [[hydroxyl]] groups at the three and seventeen positions respectively. It is [[Biosynthesis|biosynthesized]] in several steps from cholesterol and is converted in the liver to inactive metabolites.<ref name = "Luetjens_2012" />  It exerts its action through binding to and activation of the [[androgen receptor]].<ref name = "Luetjens_2012">{{cite book | editor-last1 = Nieschlag | editor-first1 = Eberhard | editor-last2 = Behre | editor-first2 = Hermann M. | editor-last3 = Nieschlag | editor-first3 = Susan | name-list-format = vanc | title = Testosterone: Action, Deficiency, Substitution | first1 = C.

In humans and most other [[vertebrate]]s, testosterone is secreted primarily by the [[testicles]] of [[male]]s and, to a lesser extent, the [[ovaries]] of [[female]]s. Small amounts are also secreted by the [[adrenal gland]]s. On average, in adult males, levels of testosterone are about 7–8 times as great as in adult females.<ref name="pmid14981046">{{cite journal | vauthors = Torjesen PA, Sandnes L | title = Serum testosterone in women as measured by an automated immunoassay and a RIA | journal = Clinical Chemistry | volume = 50 | issue = 3 | pages = 678; author reply 678–9 | date = Mar 2004 | pmid = 14981046 | doi = 10.1373/clinchem.2003.027565 }}</ref> As the metabolic consumption of testosterone in males is greater, the daily production is about 20 times greater in men.<ref name="pmid6025472">{{cite journal | vauthors = Southren AL, Gordon GG, Tochimoto S, Pinzon G, Lane DR, Stypulkowski W | title = Mean plasma concentration, metabolic clearance and basal plasma production rates of testosterone in normal young men and women using a constant infusion procedure: effect of time of day and plasma concentration on the metabolic clearance rate of testosterone | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 27 | issue = 5 | pages = 686–94 | date = May 1967 | pmid = 6025472 | doi = 10.1210/jcem-27-5-686 }}</ref><ref name="pmid5843701">{{cite journal | vauthors = Southren AL, Tochimoto S, Carmody NC, Isurugi K | title = Plasma production rates of testosterone in normal adult men and women and in patients with the syndrome of feminizing testes | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 25 | issue = 11 | pages = 1441–50 | date = Nov 1965 | pmid = 5843701 | doi = 10.1210/jcem-25-11-1441 }}</ref> Females are also more sensitive to the hormone.<ref name="isbn0-07-135739-4">{{cite book | vauthors = Dabbs M, Dabbs JM | title = Heroes, rogues, and lovers: testosterone and behavior | edition = | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-07-135739-4 }}</ref>

==Physiological effects==
In general, [[androgens]] such as testosterone promote [[protein synthesis]] and thus growth of tissues with [[androgen receptors]].<ref name="pmid10821325">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sheffield-Moore M | title = Androgens and the control of skeletal muscle protein synthesis | journal = Annals of Medicine | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = 181–6 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10821325 | doi = 10.3109/07853890008998825 }}</ref> Testosterone can be described as having [[virilization|virilising]] and [[anabolism|anabolic]] effects (though these categorical descriptions are somewhat arbitrary, as there is a great deal of mutual overlap between them).<ref>{{cite book | chapter = Androgen Physiology, Pharmacology and Abuse | chapter-url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279000/ | first = David J | last = Handelsman | name-list-format = vanc | title = Endotext [Internet] | work = WWW.ENDOTEXT.ORG | publisher = MDText.com, Inc | date = January 2013}}</ref>
* ''Anabolic effects'' include growth of [[muscle mass]] and strength, increased [[bone density]] and strength, and stimulation of linear growth and [[bone maturation]].
* ''Androgenic effects'' include [[Developmental biology|maturation]] of the [[sex organs]], particularly the [[penis]] and the formation of the [[scrotum]] in the fetus, and after birth (usually at [[puberty]]) a deepening of the [[human voice|voice]], growth of [[facial hair]] (such as the [[beard]]) and [[axillary hair|axillary (underarm) hair]]. Many of these fall into the category of male [[secondary sex characteristics]].

Testosterone effects can also be classified by the age of usual occurrence. For [[postnatal]] effects in both males and females, these are mostly dependent on the levels and duration of circulating free testosterone.

===Before birth===
Effects before birth are divided into two categories, classified in relation to the stages of development.

The first period occurs between 4 and 6 weeks of the gestation. Examples include genital virilisation such as midline fusion, [[phallus|phallic]] [[urethra]], [[scrotum|scrotal]] thinning and [[rugae|rugation]], and [[phallic]] enlargement; although the role of testosterone is far smaller than that of [[dihydrotestosterone]]. There is also development of the [[prostate]] gland and [[seminal vesicle]]s.

During the second trimester, androgen level is associated with [[gender]] formation.<ref name="pmid19403051">{{cite journal | vauthors = Swaab DF, Garcia-Falgueras A | title = Sexual differentiation of the human brain in relation to gender identity and sexual orientation | journal = Functional Neurology | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 17–28 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19403051 | doi =  }}</ref>  This period affects the femininization or masculinization of the fetus and can be a better predictor of feminine or masculine behaviours such as sex typed behaviour than an adult's own levels. A mother's testosterone level during pregnancy is correlated with her daughter's sex-typical behavior as an adult, and the correlation is even stronger than with the daughter's own adult testosterone level.<ref name="isbn0-8135-3053-9">{{cite book | vauthors = Browne KR | title = Biology at work: rethinking sexual equality | publisher = Rutgers University Press | location = New Brunswick, N.J | year = 2002 | page = 112 | isbn = 0-8135-3053-9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vq_0BUkcZ5MC&lpg=PP1&dq=Biology%20at%20Work%3A%20Rethinking%20Sexual%20Equality&pg=PA112#v=onepage&q&f=false }}</ref>

===Early infancy===
Early infancy androgen effects are the least understood.  In the first weeks of life for male infants, testosterone levels rise. The levels remain in a pubertal range for a few months, but usually reach the barely detectable levels of childhood by 4–6 months of age.<ref name="pmid4715291">{{cite journal | vauthors = Forest MG, Cathiard AM, Bertrand JA | title = Evidence of testicular activity in early infancy | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 148–51 | date = Jul 1973 | pmid = 4715291 | doi = 10.1210/jcem-37-1-148 }}</ref><ref name="pmid1379488">{{cite journal | vauthors = Corbier P, Edwards DA, Roffi J | title = The neonatal testosterone surge: a comparative study | journal = Archives Internationales de Physiologie, de Biochimie et de Biophysique | volume = 100 | issue = 2 | pages = 127–31 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1379488 | doi = 10.3109/13813459209035274 }}</ref> The function of this rise in humans is unknown.

===Before puberty===
Before puberty effects of rising androgen levels occur in both boys and girls. These include adult-type [[body odor]], increased oiliness of skin and hair, [[acne vulgaris|acne]], [[pubarche]] (appearance of [[pubic hair]]), [[axillary hair]] (armpit hair), [[growth spurt]], accelerated [[epiphysis|bone maturation]], and [[facial hair]].<ref name="Pinyerd_2005">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pinyerd B, Zipf WB | title = Puberty-timing is everything! | journal = Journal of Pediatric Nursing | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 75–82 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15815567 | doi = 10.1016/j.pedn.2004.12.011 }}</ref>

===Pubertal===
Pubertal effects begin to occur when androgen has been higher than normal adult female levels for months or years. In males, these are usual late pubertal effects, and occur in women after prolonged periods of heightened levels of free testosterone in the blood.  The effects include:<ref name="Pinyerd_2005" /><ref name= "Ganong_2012">{{cite book | last1 = Ganong | title = Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology | publisher = TATA McGRAW Hill | isbn = 978-1-25-902753-6 | pages = 423–25 | edition = 24 | year = 2012 | name-list-format = vanc }}</ref>

Growth of [[spermatogenic]] tissue in testicles, male [[fertility]], [[human penis|penis]] or [[clitoris]] enlargement, increased [[libido]] and frequency of [[erection]] or clitoral engorgement.

This occurs indirectly via [[estradiol]] [[metabolites]] and hence more gradually in men than women. Increased muscle strength and mass, shoulders become broader and rib cage expands, deepening of voice, growth of the [[Adam's apple]]. Enlargement of [[sebaceous glands]]. This might cause acne, subcutaneous [[body fat|fat]] in face decreases. Pubic hair extends to thighs and up toward [[Navel|umbilicus]], development of [[facial hair]] ([[sideburns]], [[beard]], [[moustache]]), loss of scalp hair (androgenetic alopecia), increase in [[chest hair]], periareolar hair, [[perianal]] hair, [[leg hair]], [[Axillary hair|armpit hair]].

===Adult===
Adult testosterone effects are more clearly demonstrable in males than in females, but are likely important to both sexes. Some of these effects may decline as testosterone levels might decrease in the later decades of adult life.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kelsey TW, Li LQ, Mitchell RT, Whelan A, Anderson RA, Wallace WH | title = A validated age-related normative model for male total testosterone shows increasing variance but no decline after age 40 years | journal = PloS One | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = e109346 | date = October 8, 2014 | pmid = 25295520 | pmc = 4190174 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0109346 | bibcode = 2014PLoSO...9j9346K }}</ref>

====Biological function====
Testosterone is necessary for normal [[sperm]] development. It activates genes in [[Sertoli cell]]s, which promote differentiation of [[spermatogonia]].

====Sexual arousal====
{{See also|Hormones and sexual arousal}}

When testosterone and endorphins in ejaculated semen meet the cervical wall after sexual intercourse, females receive a spike in testosterone, endorphin, and [[oxytocin]] levels, and males after orgasm during copulation experience an increase in endorphins and a marked increase in oxytocin levels. This adds to the hospitable physiological environment in the female internal reproductive tract for conceiving, and later for nurturing the conceptus in the pre-embryonic stages, and stimulates feelings of love, desire, and paternal care in the male (this is the only time male oxytocin levels rival a female's).<ref name="pmid15177709" />

=====Mammalian studies=====
Studies conducted in rats have indicated that their degree of sexual arousal is sensitive to reductions in testosterone. When testosterone-deprived rats were given medium levels of testosterone, their sexual behaviors (copulation, partner preference, etc.) resumed, but not when given low amounts of the same hormone.

{{See also|Aggression#Testosterone|Biosocial criminology}}

Most studies support a link between adult criminality and testosterone, although the relationship is modest if examined separately for each sex. Nearly all studies of juvenile delinquency and testosterone are not significant. Most studies have also found testosterone to be associated with behaviors or personality traits linked with criminality such as [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial behavior]] and [[alcoholism]]. Many studies have also been done on the relationship between more general aggressive behavior/feelings and testosterone.

The sexual hormone can encourage fair behavior. For the study subjects took part in a behavioral experiment where the distribution of a real amount of money was decided. The rules allowed both fair and unfair offers. The negotiating partner could subsequently accept or decline the offer. The fairer the offer, the less probable a refusal by the negotiating partner.

===Biosynthesis===
Like other [[steroid]] hormones, testosterone is derived from [[cholesterol]] (see figure).<ref name="pmid1307739">{{cite journal | vauthors = Waterman MR, Keeney DS | title = Genes involved in androgen biosynthesis and the male phenotype | journal = Hormone Research | volume = 38 | issue = 5–6 | pages = 217–21 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1307739 | doi = 10.1159/000182546 }}</ref> The first step in the [[biosynthesis]] involves the oxidative cleavage of the side-chain of cholesterol by [[cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme]] (P450scc, CYP11A1), a [[mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] [[cytochrome P450]] oxidase with the loss of six carbon atoms to give [[pregnenolone]].

The largest amounts of testosterone (>95%) are produced by the [[testis|testes]] in men,<ref name="Mooradian_ 1987"/> while the [[adrenal gland]]s account for most of the remainder. Testosterone is also synthesized in far smaller total quantities in women by the adrenal glands, [[thecal cells]] of the [[ovary|ovaries]], and, during [[pregnancy]], by the [[placenta]].<ref name="pmid15507105">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zouboulis CC, Degitz K | title = Androgen action on human skin -- from basic research to clinical significance | journal = Experimental Dermatology | volume = 13 Suppl 4 | issue = s4 | pages = 5–10 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15507105 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0625.2004.00255.x }}</ref> In the [[testes]], testosterone is produced by the [[Leydig cell]]s.<ref name="pmid58744">{{cite journal | vauthors = Brooks RV | title = Androgens | journal = Clinics in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 503–20 | date = Nov 1975 | pmid = 58744 | doi = 10.1016/S0300-595X(75)80045-4 }}</ref> The male generative glands also contain [[Sertoli cell]]s, which require testosterone for [[spermatogenesis]]. Like most hormones, testosterone is supplied to target tissues in the blood where much of it is transported bound to a specific [[plasma protein]], [[sex hormone-binding globulin]] (SHBG).

===Regulation===
[[File:Hypothalamus pituitary testicles axis.png|thumb|right|Hypothalamic–pituitary–testicular axis]]
In males, testosterone is synthesized primarily in [[Leydig cells]]. The number of Leydig cells in turn is regulated by [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) and [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH). In addition, the amount of testosterone produced by existing Leydig cells is under the control of LH, which regulates the expression of [[17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]].<ref name="isbn0-9627422-7-9">{{cite book | vauthors =  Payne AH, O'Shaughnessy P |veditors=Payne AH, Hardy MP, Russell LD | title = Leydig Cell | edition = | publisher = Cache River Press | location = Vienna [Il] | year = 1996 | origyear = | pages = 260–85 | quote = | isbn = 0-9627422-7-9 | oclc = | doi = | chapter = Structure, function, and regulation of steroidogenic enzymes in the Leydig cell }}</ref>

These latter two hormones stimulate the testis to synthesize testosterone.  Finally, increasing levels of testosterone through a negative [[feedback]] loop act on the hypothalamus and pituitary to inhibit the release of GnRH and FSH/LH, respectively.

Free testosterone (T) is transported into the [[cytoplasm]] of target [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] [[Cell (biology)|cells]], where it can bind to the [[androgen receptor]], or can be reduced to 5α-[[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme [[5α-reductase]].

Androgen receptors occur in many different vertebrate body system tissues, and both males and females respond similarly to similar levels. Greatly differing amounts of testosterone prenatally, at puberty, and throughout life account for a share of biological [[sexual differentiation|differences]] between males and females.

The bones and the brain are two important tissues in humans where the primary effect of testosterone is by way of [[aromatization]] to [[estradiol]]. In the bones, estradiol accelerates ossification of cartilage into bone, leading to closure of the [[epiphysis|epiphyses]] and conclusion of growth.

==History==
A [[testicular]] action was linked to circulating blood fractions&nbsp;– now understood to be a family of androgenic hormones&nbsp;– in the early work on castration and testicular transplantation in fowl by [[Arnold Adolph Berthold]] (1803–1861).<ref name="Berthold_1849">{{cite journal | vauthors = Berthold AA | title = Transplantation der Hoden | trans_title = Transplantation of testis | language = German | journal = Arch. Anat. Physiol. Wiss. |volume = 16 |issue =  |pages = 42–6 | year = 1849 | pmid = | doi= | url =}}</ref> Research on the action of testosterone received a brief boost in 1889, when the Harvard professor [[Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard]] (1817–1894), then in Paris, self-injected subcutaneously a "rejuvenating elixir" consisting of an extract of dog and guinea pig testicle.  He reported in ''[[The Lancet]]'' that his vigor and feeling of well-being were markedly restored but the effects were transient,<ref name="Brown-Sequard_1889">{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown-Sequard CE | title = The effects produced on man by subcutaneous injections of liquid obtained from the testicles of animals |language = | journal = Lancet |volume = 2 | issue =  3438|pages = 105–07| year = 1889 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(00)64118-1 }}</ref> and Brown-Séquard's hopes for the compound were dashed. Suffering the ridicule of his colleagues, he abandoned his work on the mechanisms and effects of androgens in human beings.

In 1927, the University of Chicago's Professor of Physiologic Chemistry, Fred C. Koch, established easy access to a large source of bovine testicles — the Chicago stockyards — and recruited students willing to endure the tedious work of extracting their isolates. In that year, Koch and his student, Lemuel McGee, derived 20&nbsp;mg of a substance from a supply of 40 pounds of bovine testicles that, when administered to castrated roosters, pigs and rats, remasculinized them.<ref name="Gallagher_Koch_1929">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallagher TF, Koch FC | title = The testicular hormone |journal = J. Biol. Chem. | volume = 84 | issue = 2 | pages = 495–500 |date=November 1929 | pmid = | doi = }}</ref> The group of Ernst Laqueur at the University of Amsterdam purified testosterone from bovine testicles in a similar manner in 1934, but isolation of the hormone from animal tissues in amounts permitting serious study in humans was not feasible until three European pharmaceutical giants—[[Schering AG|Schering]] (Berlin, Germany), [[Organon International|Organon]] (Oss, Netherlands) and [[Novartis|Ciba]] (Basel, Switzerland)—began full-scale steroid research and development programs in the 1930s.

The Organon group in the Netherlands were the first to isolate the hormone, identified in a May 1935 paper "On Crystalline Male Hormone from Testicles (Testosterone)".<ref name="David_1935">{{cite journal | vauthors = David KG, Dingemanse E, Freud JL | title = Über krystallinisches mannliches Hormon aus Hoden (Testosteron) wirksamer als aus harn oder aus Cholesterin bereitetes Androsteron | trans_title = On crystalline male hormone from testicles (testosterone) effective as from urine or from cholesterol | language = German | journal = Hoppe Seylers Z Physiol Chem | volume = 233 | issue = 5–6| pages = 281–83 |date=May 1935 | pmid = | doi = 10.1515/bchm2.1935.233.5-6.281 }}</ref> They named the hormone ''testosterone'', from the [[stem (linguistics)|stems]] of ''testicle'' and ''[[sterol]]'', and the [[suffix]] of ''[[ketone]]''.

The partial synthesis in the 1930s of abundant, potent [[testosterone ester]]s permitted the characterization of the hormone's effects, so that Kochakian and Murlin (1936) were able to show that testosterone raised nitrogen retention (a mechanism central to anabolism) in the dog, after which Allan Kenyon's group<ref name=" Kenyon _1940">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kenyon AT, Knowlton K, Sandiford I, Koch FC, Lotwin, G | title = A comparative study of the metabolic effects of testosterone propionate in normal men and women and in eunuchoidism | journal  = Endocrinology  | volume =  26| issue = 1 | pages = 26–45 |date=February 1940| doi = 10.1210/Endo-26-1-26 | url =   }}</ref> was able to demonstrate both anabolic and androgenic effects of testosterone propionate in eunuchoidal men, boys, and women.
