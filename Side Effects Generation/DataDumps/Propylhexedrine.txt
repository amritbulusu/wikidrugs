'''Propylhexedrine''' ('''Benzedrex''', '''Obesin''')  or hexahydromethamphetamine is a stimulant drug. It is an anolog of [[methamphetamine]] that is used medicinally as a [[nasal decongestant]] (for relief of congestion due to [[Common cold|colds]], [[Allergy|allergies]] and allergic [[rhinitis]]) and recreationally for its psychostimulant effects. When used as a [[vasoconstrictor]] used to decongest nasal mucosa, it is administered by [[inhalation]]. Propylhexedrine is a [[structural analog]] of [[methamphetamine]]. The only difference is that propylhexedrine has a saturated [[cyclohexane]] ring where methamphetamine has a [[benzene]] ring.

Propylhexedrine is most commonly found in [[Over-the-counter substance|over-the-counter]] Benzedrex inhalers. Benzedrex was first manufactured by [[Smith, Kline and French]] after the [[Benzedrine]] inhaler, which contained [[Racemate|racemic]] [[amphetamine]], became unavailable following the placement of amphetamines on the US [[Controlled Substances Act|Schedule II]] status (highest abuse potential, yet with accepted medicinal uses). Benzedrex is currently manufactured by B.F. Ascher & Co. Inc. Pharmaceuticals.<ref name="B.F. Ascher & Company, inc2">{{cite web|url=http://bfascher.com/products/benzedrex/|title=Benzedrex Inhaler Nasal Decongestant Inhaler|work=Benzedrex Inhaler Nasal Decongestant Inhaler|publisher=B.F. Ascher & Company, inc.|accessdate=27 March 2013}}</ref>

Propylhexedrine has also seen use in [[Europe]] as an [[appetite suppressant]] under the trade name Obesin<ref name="pmid28749702">{{cite journal|author=Wesson DR|date=June 1986|title=Propylhexdrine|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037687168690013X|journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence|volume=17|issue=2–3|pages=273–8|doi=10.1016/0376-8716(86)90013-X|pmid=2874970}}</ref> and in the [[anticonvulsant]] preparation [[barbexaclone]] its ''S''-isomer ([[levopropylhexedrine]] or <small>L</small>-propylhexedrine) is bonded with [[phenobarbital]] for the purpose of offsetting the barbiturate-induced [[sedation]].<ref name="pmid28749702" /> Levopropylhexedrine is also used as an [[anorectic]] under the brand name Eventin.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eventin|url=http://www.drugs.com/international/eventin.html|publisher=Drugs.com|accessdate=27 March 2013}}</ref> 

Chemistry

[[Free base]] propylhexedrine is a volatile, oily liquid at room temperature. The slow vaporization of free base propylhexedrine allows it to be administered via inhalation.<ref>[http://www.google.com/patents/US4095596 Nasal Inhaler], {{cite patent|US|4095596}}</ref> Acid salts of propylhexedrine (such as propylhexedrine [[Hydrochloride|HCl]]) often present as a stable, clear to off-white crystalline powder that readily dissolves in water.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Journal of Trauma-Injury Infection & Critical Care | year = 1983 | volume = 23 | issue = 7 | pages = 650 | title = Tissue Injuries Associated With Parenteral Propylhexedrine Abuse | author = Mancusi-Ungaro, H.

Propylhexedrine is structurally similar to [[phenylethylamines]], with the only structural difference being the substitution of an [[alicyclic]] [[cyclohexane|cyclohexyl]] group for the aromatic [[phenyl]] group of [[phenylethylamines|phenethylamine]]. Propylhexedrine is not an amphetamine, nor even a [[phenethylamine]], but instead can be referred to as a [[cycloalkane|cycloalkyl]][[amine]]. Propylhexedrine is somewhat less potent than structurally similar [[amphetamines]].{{cn|date=August 2016}}

Propylhexedrine is a chiral compound (the α-carbon is chiral), and active ingredient contained in Benzedrex inhalers is [[racemic]] (''RS'')-propylhexedrine as the free base. (''S'')-Propylhexedrine, also known as levopropylhexedrine, is believed to be the more biologically active isomer of the two.<ref>{{cite journal | title = The Pharmacologic Activity of N-Methyl-β-cyclohexylisopropylamine Hydrochloride |author1=A.

Doerge, page 491</ref>

===Synthesis===
Propylhexedrine can be synthesized starting with [[cyclohexylacetone]] in a similar fashion to the phenylacetone synthesis of [[methamphetamine]].<ref>Merck Index 7761 - Kleeman & Engel p.774 OCDS Vol.1 p.37 (1977) I.N. p.817</ref> 

However, more commonly propylhexedrine is prepared by reacting [[methamphetamine]] with [[Adams' catalyst]], reducing methamphetamine's aromatic ring to a [[cyclohexyl]] moiety.

== Pharmacology ==
Propylhexedrine is a [[TAAR1 agonist]] like [[amphetamine]].<ref name="DB" /> Consequently, it reverses the transporters for [[dopamine]], [[norepinephrine]] and [[serotonin]], leading to a release of monoamines from presynaptic [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s into the [[synaptic cleft]].<ref name="DB" /> The increased level of monoamines within the synapse results in increased activity at these receptors. Additionally, propylhexedrine appears to antagonize the [[VMAT2]] transporter, leading to a further increase in the aforementioned monoamines.<ref name="DB" /> The pharmacological actions of propylhexedrine are similar to that of structurally similar stimulant [[phenethylamines]], such as [[amphetamine]].<ref name="DB">[http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB06714 Propylhexedrine's DrugBank Entry]</ref>

=== Metabolism ===
Propylhexedrine undergoes metabolism to form various metabolites including [[norpropylhexedrine]], [[cyclohexylacetoxime]], ''cis''- and ''trans''-4-hydroxypropylhexedrine.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 4428789 | year = 1974 | last1 = Midha | first1 = KK | last2 = Beckett | first2 = AH | last3 = Saunders | first3 = A | title = Identification of the Major Metabolites of Propylhexedrine in vivo (in man) and in vitro (in guinea pig and rabbit) | volume = 4 | issue = 10 | pages = 627–635 | journal = Xenobiotica | doi=10.1080/00498257409169765}}</ref>

== Contraindications ==
Propylhexedrine should not be used if an [[MAOI]] has been used in the past 14 days, or is being currently used, as this can lead to a [[hypertensive crisis]]. People with cardiac disease should not use propylhexedrine.<ref>[http://reference.medscape.com/drug/benzedrex-propylhexedrine-343411#5 Propylhexedrine Contraindications - Medscape]</ref>

Additionally, drugs such as stimulants and [[sympathomimetic]]s should not be taken along with propylhexedrine, as this can lead to potentially dangerous spikes in [[blood pressure]] and irregular heart rhythms.<ref>[https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/prescription-drugs/stimulants/it-safe-to-use-stimulants-other-medications Safety of mixing stimulants with medications - NIDA]</ref>

There is one case of death where a combination of propylhexedrine, acetaminophen, morphine, promethazine, and [[Mitragynine|kratom]] was detected. However the study indicates that kratom toxicity was not included as one of the causes of death and that propylhexedrine was the principal cause of death.<ref name="toxicity-death">{{cite journal |url=http://jat.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/1/54.full.pdf|last1=Holler |first1=J. M. |last2=Vorce |first2=S. P. |last3=McDonough-Bender |first3=P. C. |last4=Magluilo |first4=J. |last5=Solomon |first5=C.

== Medical use ==
Propylhexedrine is used to treat acute [[nasal congestion]] related to [[cold|common cold]],<ref name="B.F. Ascher & Company, inc">{{cite web|url=http://bfascher.com/products/benzedrex/|title=Benzedrex Inhaler Nasal Decongestant Inhaler|work=Benzedrex Inhaler Nasal Decongestant Inhaler|publisher=B.F. Ascher & Company, inc.|accessdate=27 March 2013}}</ref> [[allergies]] and [[hay fever]]. For nasal congestion, the dosage is listed as four inhalations (two inhalations per nostril) every two hours for adults and children 6–12 years of age. Each inhalation delivers 0.4 to 0.5 milligrams (400 to 500 [[micrograms|''μ''g]]) in 800 [[Litre|millilitre]]s of air.<ref name="B.F. Ascher & Company, inc"/> Historically, it has also been used for [[weight loss]].<ref>{{cite journal|first1=J R|last1=Docherty|title=Pharmacology of stimulants prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)|journal=British Journal of Pharmacology|date=1 June 2008|pages=606–622|volume=154|issue=3|doi=10.1038/bjp.2008.124|pmid=18500382|pmc=2439527}}</ref>

== Recreational use ==
Propylhexedrine is used recreationally, in common with as the other amphetamine analogs such as Adderall, mixed amphetamine salts, methamphetamine and dextroamphetamine. 

It is not in any way suggested to be used in such a manner by the manufacturer. The amount propylhexedrine (250 mg) in each cotton rod greatly exceeds the daily recommended dosage when used for allergies. When abused in such a manner it is important to realise the risks.  

Health problems have resulted from users ingesting the actual cotton rod. Gastrointestinal blockage is highly likely when eating cotton thus causing damage to the digestive tract.  

Long term health problems will develop from daily use. Compared to dextroamphetamine, it is a heavier strain on the cardiovascular system, and the risk of heart damage increases when used daily. This is the main reason why propylhexedrine is not used clinically with the exception of very small dosages via inhalation for allergies (benzedrex).   

=== Effects ===
Propylhexedrine has [[sympathomimetic]], [[adrenergic agonist|adrenergic]], [[vasoconstrictor|vasocontricive]] and [[psychostimulant]] effects when taken above the medical dosage. Effects include increased [[sweating]], talkativeness, [[mydriasis]], [[emotional lability]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[tachycardia]], [[palpitations]], [[dry mouth]], [[bruxism]], [[anxiety]], [[euphoria]] or [[dysphoria]], increased [[aggressiveness]], [[paranoia]], [[headache]], [[dizziness]], [[psychosis]], slurred or impaired speech, rarely [[convulsions]] and serious [[heart]] problems.<ref name="Fornazzari">{{cite journal | first1=L | last1=Fornazzari | title=Intravenous Abuse of Propylhexedrine (Benzedrex®) and the Risk of Brainstem Dysfunction in Young Adults | last2=Carlen | first2=PL | last3=Kapur | first3=BM | journal=Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences / Journal Canadien des Sciences Neurologiques | year=1986 | volume=13 | issue=4 | pages=337–339 | doi=10.1017/S0317167100036696 | pmid=2877725}}</ref> Propylhexedrine can also cause swelling, dryness and irritation of [[mucous membranes]].<ref>[https://www.caymanchem.com/msdss/12058m.pdf Safety Data Sheet - Cayman Chemical]</ref>

=== Injection risks ===
While propylhexedrine is limited in a number of administration routes, attempts to extract the drug from the nasal inhaler and then inject it have been reported. Recreational use by intravenous injection (IV) is dangerous and could result in serious bodily harm or death. IV use of propylhexedrine is known to cause mild side-effects such as [[diplopia|transient diplopia]] as well as some serious (and potentially fatal) effects such as brainstem dysfunction, and deaths have been recorded in the medical literature. Typically, recorded cases of IV use are prepared by forming propylhexedrine [[hydrochloride|HCl]] in a solution with hydrochloric acid, the solution is then heated to evaporate and the resulting crystals are dissolved in water for injection.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Proposed Rules | journal=Federal Register | volume=50 | issue=10 | pages=2226–2227}}</ref><ref>{{cite court | litigants= Prince v.
