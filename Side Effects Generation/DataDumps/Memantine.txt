'''Memantine''' is used to treat moderate to severe [[Alzheimer's disease]].  It acts on the [[glutamatergic system]] by blocking [[NMDA receptor]]s. It was first synthesized by [[Eli Lilly and Company]] in 1968 as a potential agent to treat diabetes; the NMDA activity was discovered in the 1980s.

== Pharmacology ==

=== Glutamatergic (NMDA receptor) ===
A dysfunction of glutamatergic neurotransmission, manifested as [[neuron]]al [[excitotoxicity]], is hypothesized to be involved in the [[etiology]] of [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Targeting the [[glutamic acid|glutamatergic]] system, specifically [[NMDA receptor]]s, offers a novel approach to treatment in view of the limited efficacy of existing drugs targeting the [[Acetylcholine|cholinergic]] system.<ref name=Cacabelos1999>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cacabelos R, Takeda M, Winblad B |title=The glutamatergic system and neurodegeneration in dementia: preventive strategies in Alzheimer's disease |journal=Int J Geriatr Psychiatry |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=3–47 |date=January 1999 |pmid=10029935 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-1166(199901)14:1<3::AID-GPS897>3.0.CO;2-7}}</ref>

The low affinity, uncompetitive nature, and rapid off-rate kinetics of memantine at the level of the NMDA receptor-channel, however, preserves the function of the receptor at synapses, as it can still be activated by physiological release of [[glutamate]] following [[depolarization]] of the [[presynaptic]] neuron.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Xia P, Chen HS, Zhang D, Lipton SA | year = 2010 | title = Memantine preferentially blocks extrasynaptic over synaptic NMDA receptor currents in hippocampal autapses | url = | journal = J.

=== Cholinergic (nicotinic acetylcholine receptor) ===
Memantine acts as a non-competitive antagonist at different neuronal [[Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor|nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs)]] at potencies possibly similar to the NMDA and 5-HT3 receptors, but this is difficult to ascertain with accuracy because of the rapid desensitization of nAChR responses in these experiments. It can be noted that memantine is an antagonist at [[Alpha-7 nicotinic receptor|Alpha-7 nAChR]], which may contribute to initial worsening of cognitive function during early memantine treatment. [[Alpha-7 nicotinic receptor|Alpha-7 nAChR]] upregulates quickly in response to antagonism, which could explain the cognitive-enhancing effects of chronic memantine treatment.<ref name=Buisson1998>{{cite journal |vauthors=Buisson B, Bertrand D |title=Open-channel blockers at the human alpha4beta2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor |journal=Mol Pharmacol. |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=555–63 |date=1 March 1998|pmid=9495824 |url=http://molpharm.aspetjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9495824 }}</ref><ref name=Aracava2005>{{cite journal |vauthors=Aracava Y, Pereira EF, Maelicke A, Albuquerque EX |title=Memantine blocks alpha7* nicotinic acetylcholine receptors more potently than n-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in rat hippocampal neurons |journal=J Pharmacol Exp Ther. |volume=312 |issue=3 |pages=1195–205 |date=March 2005 |pmid=15522999 |doi=10.1124/jpet.104.077172 }}</ref> It has been shown that the number of nicotinic receptors in the brain are reduced in Alzheimer's disease, even in the absence of a general decrease in the number of neurons, and [[nicotinic receptor]] [[agonists]] are viewed as interesting targets for anti-Alzheimer drugs.<ref name=Gotti2004>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gotti C, Clementi F |title=Neuronal nicotinic receptors: from structure to pathology |journal=Prog Neurobiol. |volume=74 |issue=6 |pages=363–96 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15649582 |doi=10.1016/j.pneurobio.2004.09.006 }}</ref>

=== Dopaminergic (D<sub>2</sub> receptor) ===
Memantine acts as an agonist at the dopamine [[D2 receptor|D<sub>2</sub> receptor]] with equal or slightly higher affinity than to the NMDA receptors.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Seeman P, Caruso C, Lasaga M |title=Memantine agonist action at dopamine D2High receptors |journal=Synapse |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=149–53 |date=February 2008 |pmid=18000814 |doi=10.1002/syn.20472 }}</ref>

=== Sigmaergic (σ1 receptor) ===
It acts as an agonist at the [[Sigma receptor|σ1 receptor]] with a low K<sub>i</sub> of 2.6 [[micrometre|µm]] (2600&nbsp;nm).<ref name="pmid15090047">{{cite journal |vauthors=Peeters M, Romieu P, Maurice T, Su TP, Maloteaux JM, Hermans E | title = Involvement of the sigma 1 receptor in the modulation of dopaminergic transmission by amantadine | pmid = 15090047 | doi=10.1111/j.0953-816X.2004.03297.x | volume=19 | issue = 8 | date=Apr 2004 | journal=Eur J Neurosci | pages=2212–20}}</ref> The consequences of this activity are unclear (as the role of sigma receptors in general is not yet that well understood) and memantine is probably too weak at the sigma binding site to exhibit significant agonist effects, only exhibiting partial agonism or antagonism. Some of memantine's adverse effects arise through this route.

== History ==
{{Main article|Discovery and development of memantine and related compounds}}
Memantine was first synthesized and patented by Eli Lilly and Company in 1968 as an anti-diabetic agent, but it was ineffective at lowering blood sugar.  Later it was discovered to have CNS activity, and was developed by [[Merz Pharma|Merz]] for dementia in Germany; the NMDA activity was discovered after clinical trials had already begun.  Memantine was first marketed for dementia in Germany in 1989 under the name Axura.<ref name=NRDD/>

In the US, some CNS activities were discovered at [[Children's Hospital of Boston]] in 1995, and Children's licensed patents covering uses of memantine outside the field of ophthalmology to [[Neurobiological Technologies]] (NTI) in 1995.<ref name=10KSB1996>{{cite web|title=Form 10-KSB For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1996|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/918112/0000950005-96-000781.txt|publisher=SEC Edgar|date=September 30, 1996}} NTI-Childrens' license is included in the filing.</ref>  In 1998 NTI amended its agreement with Children's to allow Merz to take over development.<ref name=SVBJ2000>{{cite news|last1=Delevett|first1=Peter|title=Cash is king, focus is queen|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2000/01/10/smallb1.html|work=Silicon Valley Business Journal|date=January 9, 2000}}</ref>

In 2000 Merz partnered with [[Forest Laboratories|Forest]] to develop the drug for Alzheimers in the U.S. under the name Namenda.<ref name=NRDD>Witt A, Macdonald N, Kirkpatrick P. Memantine hydrochloride. Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2004 Feb;3(2):109-10. {{PMID|15040575}}</ref>

In 2000 Merz partnered with Suntory for the Japanese market and with Lundbeck for other markets including Europe;<ref>Staff, the Pharma Letter. August 15, 2000 [http://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/lundbeck-signs-memantine-licensing-agreement-for-merz-co Lundbeck signs memantine licensing agreement for Merz+Co]</ref> the drug was originally marketed by Lundbeck under the name Ebixa.<ref name=NRDD/>  

Sales of the drug reached $1.8 billion for 2014.<ref>[http://www.drugs.com/stats/namenda Drugs.com] Namenda Sales Data.

In February 2014 as the July 2015 patent expiration for memantine neared, [[Actavis]], which had acquired Forest, announced that it was launching an extended release (XR) form of memantine that could be taken once a day instead of twice a day as needed with the then-current "immediate release" (IR) version, and that it intended to stop selling the IR version in August 2014 and withdraw the marketing authorization.  This is a tactic to thwart generic competition called "[[product hopping]]".  However the supply of the XR version ran short, so Actavis extended the deadline until the fall.  In September 2014 the attorney general of New York, [[Eric Schneiderman]], filed a lawsuit to compel Actavis to keep selling the IR version on the basis of [[antitrust]] law.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pollack|first1=Andrew|title=Forest Laboratories' Namenda Is Focus of Lawsuit|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/16/business/new-york-files-antitrust-suit-against-maker-of-alzheimers-drug.html|work=The New York Times|date=15 September 2014}}</ref><ref name=Capati>{{cite journal|last1=Capati|first1=Vincent C.|last2=Kesselheim|first2=Aaron S.|title=Drug Product Life-Cycle Management as Anticompetitive Behavior: The Case of Memantine|journal=Journal of Managed Care & Specialty Pharmacy|date=29 March 2016|volume=22|issue=4|pages=339–344|doi=10.18553/jmcp.2016.22.4.339|url=http://www.jmcp.org/doi/full/10.18553/jmcp.2016.22.4.339|issn=2376-0540}}</ref>  

In December 2014, a judge granted New York State its request and issued an injunction, preventing Actavis from withdrawing the IR version until generic versions could launch.  Actavis appealed and in May a panel of the [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] upheld the injunction, and in June Actavis asked that its case be heard by the full Second Circuit panel to hear its case.<ref>{{cite news|title=Actavis Confirms Appeals Court Ruling Requiring Continued Distribution of Namenda IR|url=https://www.allergan.com/news/news/thomson-reuters/actavis-confirms-appeals-court-ruling-requiring-co|work=Actavis|date=May 22, 2015|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Gurrieri|first1=Vin|title=Actavis, Others Plotted To Delay Generic Namenda, Suit Says - Law360|url=https://www.law360.com/articles/665234/actavis-others-plotted-to-delay-generic-namenda-suit-says|work=Law360|date=June 9, 2015|language=en}}</ref>  In August 2015 Actavis' request was denied.<ref>{{cite news|last1=LoBiondo|first1=George A.|title=Second Circuit Denies Petition for Actavis Rehearing {{!}} David Kleban|url=https://www.pbwt.com/david-kleban/antitrust-update-blog-2/second-circuit-denies-petition-for-actavis-rehearing/|work=Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler LLP|date=August 12, 2015}}</ref>
