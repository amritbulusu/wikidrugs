'''Dissociatives''' are a class of [[hallucinogen]], which distort perceptions of sight and sound and produce feelings of detachment – dissociation – from the environment and self. This is done through reducing or blocking signals to the [[conscious mind]] from other parts of the brain.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tamminga |first1=C.

Many dissociatives have general [[depressant]] effects and can produce [[sedation]], [[respiratory depression]], [[analgesia]], [[anesthesia]], and [[ataxia]], as well as [[cognitive deficit|cognitive and memory impairment]] and [[amnesia]].

Some patients found the hallucinations euphoric while others found them disturbing.

At sub-anesthetic doses, dissociatives alter many of the same cognitive and perceptual processes affected by other hallucinogenic drugs such as [[mescaline]], [[LSD]], and [[psilocybin]]; hence they are also considered [[hallucinogenic]], and [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mason |first1=Oliver J. |last2=Morgan |first2=Celia J.M. |last3=Stefanovic |first3=Ana |last4=Curran |first4=H Valerie |title=The Psychotomimetic States Inventory (PSI): Measuring psychotic-type experiences from ketamine and cannabis |journal=Schizophrenia Research |volume=103 |issue=1-3 |pages=138–42 |year=2008 |pmid=18387788 |doi=10.1016/j.schres.2008.02.020}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=12762561 |last1=Lim |first1=DK |year=2003 |pages=31–4 |issue=1 |volume=44 |title=Ketamine associated psychedelic effects and dependence. |journal=Singapore medical journal |url=http://www.sma.org.sg/smj/4401/4401a5.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gouzoulis-Mayfrank |first1=E. |last2=Heekeren |first2=K. |last3=Neukirch |first3=A. |last4=Stoll |first4=M. |last5=Stock |first5=C. |last6=Obradovic |first6=M. |last7=Kovar |first7=K.-A. |title=Psychological Effects of (S)-Ketamine and N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT): A Double-Blind, Cross-Over Study in Healthy Volunteers |journal=Pharmacopsychiatry |volume=38 |issue=6 |pages=301–11 |year=2005 |pmid=16342002 |doi=10.1055/s-2005-916185}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=9250944 |last1=Krupitsky |year=1997 |first1=EM |pages=165–83 |issue=2 |volume=29 |last2=Grinenko |journal=Journal of Psychoactive Drugs |first2=AY |title=Ketamine psychedelic therapy (KPT): a review of the results of ten years of research. |url=http://www.eleusis.us/resource-center/references/kpt10yrs.php |doi=10.1080/02791072.1997.10400185}}</ref>  Perhaps the most significant subjective differences between dissociatives and the [[serotonergic psychedelic|classical hallucinogens]] (such as [[LSD]] and [[mescaline]]) are the dissociative effects, including: [[depersonalization]], the feeling of being unreal, disconnected from one's self, or unable to control one's actions; and [[derealization]], the feeling that the outside world is unreal or that one is dreaming.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vollenweider |first1=F |last2=Geyer |first2=MA |title=A systems model of altered consciousness: integrating natural and drug-induced psychoses |journal=Brain Research Bulletin |volume=56 |issue=5 |pages=495–507 |year=2001 |pmid=11750795 |doi=10.1016/S0361-9230(01)00646-3}}</ref>

=== Recreational use ===
Some dissociative drugs are used recreationally. [[Ketamine]] and [[nitrous oxide]] are [[club drugs]]. [[Phencyclidine]] (PCP or angel dust) is available as a street drug. [[Dextromethorphan]]-based cough syrups (often labeled DXM) are taken by some users in higher than medically recommended levels for their dissociative effects. Historically, [[chloroform]] and [[diethyl ether]] have been used recreationally (as was nitrous oxide, at laughing gas parties).
