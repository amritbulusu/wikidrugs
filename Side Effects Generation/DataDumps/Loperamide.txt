It is also useful for reducing [[ileostomy]] output. [[Off-label use]]s for loperamide also include chemotherapy induced diarrhea, especially related to [[irinotecan]] use.

Loperamide should not be used as the primary treatment in cases of bloody diarrhea, acute exacerbation of [[ulcerative colitis]], or bacterial [[enterocolitis]].<ref name=drugs.com>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/pro/loperamide.html|title=Loperamide|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520143952/http://www.drugs.com/pro/loperamide.html|archivedate=20 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Drug interactions==
Loperamide is a substrate of [[P-glycoprotein]]; therefore, the concentration of loperamide will increase when given with a P-glycoprotein inhibitor.<ref name=ReferenceA/> Common P-glycoprotein inhibitors include [[quinidine]], [[ritonavir]], and [[ketoconazole]], among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/drugs/developmentapprovalprocess/developmentresources/druginteractionslabeling/ucm093664.htm#PgpTransport|title=Drug Development and Drug Interactions:  Table of Substrates, Inhibitors and Inducers|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510152158/http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/DrugInteractionsLabeling/ucm093664.htm#PgpTransport|archivedate=10 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Loperamide is capable of decreasing the absorption of some other drugs. As an example, when [[saquinavir]] concentrations can decrease by half when given with loperamide.<ref name=ReferenceA/>

Loperamide is an anti-diarrheal agent which decreases intestinal movement. As such, when combined with other antimotility drugs, there is an increased risk of constipation. These drugs include other [[opioid]]s, [[antihistamine]]s, [[antipsychotic]]s, and [[anticholinergic]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://online.epocrates.com/noFrame/showPage.do?method=drugs&MonographId=44&ActiveSectionId=4|title=Epocrates Page Not Found|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2016}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
[[File:Loperamide ball-and-stick.png|thumb|Ball-and-stick model of loperamide molecule]]
Loperamide is an [[opioid]]-receptor [[agonist]] and acts on the [[Mu Opioid receptor|μ-opioid receptors]] in the [[myenteric plexus]] of the large intestine. Loperamide works like [[morphine]], decreasing the activity of the myenteric plexus, which decreases the tone of the longitudinal and circular [[smooth muscle]]s of the intestinal wall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00836|title=DrugBank: Loperamide|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510135146/http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00836|archivedate=10 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/mmx/loperamide-hydrochloride.html|title=Loperamide Hydrochloride Drug Information, Professional|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503123442/http://www.drugs.com/mmx/loperamide-hydrochloride.html|archivedate=3 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This increases the time material stays in the intestine, allowing more water to be absorbed from the fecal matter.
