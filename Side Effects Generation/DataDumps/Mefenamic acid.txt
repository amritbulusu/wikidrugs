'''Mefenamic acid''' is a member of the [[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug#Anthranilic acid derivatives .28Fenamates.29|anthranilic acid derivatives]] (or fenamate) class of [[NSAID]] drugs, and is used to treat mild to moderate pain, including [[dysmenorrhea|menstrual pain]], and is sometimes used to prevent migraines associated with menstruation.<ref name=Label/><ref name=Pringsheim/> It is not widely used in the United States due to its side effects and high cost compared to other NSAID drugs.<ref name=LiverTox/><ref name=Aronson/>{{rp|334}}

Its name derives from its systematic name, di'''me'''thyl'''phen'''yl'''am'''inobenzo'''ic acid'''. It was discovered and brought to market by [[Parke-Davis]] in the 1960s. It became generic in the 1980s and is available worldwide under many brand names.<ref name=BrandNames/> As of 2015 the cost for a typical course of medication in the United States is more than 200 USD.<ref name=Ric2015>{{cite book|last1=Hamilton|first1=Richart|title=Tarascon Pocket Pharmacopoeia 2015 Deluxe Lab-Coat Edition|date=2015|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning|isbn=9781284057560|page=X}}</ref>

==Medical use==
Mefenamic acid is used to treat moderate pain and [[dysmenorrhea|menstrual pain]].<ref name=Label>FDA [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2008/015034s040lbl.pdf Ponstel Label] Updated February 19, 2008</ref>

There is evidence that supports the use of mefenamic acid for perimenstrual [[migraine headache]] prophylaxis, with treatment starting 2 days prior to the onset of flow or 1 day prior to the expected onset of the headache and continuing for the duration of [[menstruation]].<ref name=Pringsheim>{{ cite journal |author1=Pringsheim, T. |author2=Davenport, W.

==Side effects==
Mefenamic acid is recommended to be taken with food.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a681028.html#side-effects | publisher = National Institutes of Health | work = Medline Plus | title = Side effects for Mefenamic Acid }}</ref>

Known mild [[Adverse drug reaction|side effects]] of mefenamic acid include [[headache]]s, nervousness, and [[vomiting]].  Serious side effects may include [[diarrhea]], [[hematemesis]] (vomiting blood), [[hematuria]] (blood in urine), blurred vision, skin rash, itching and swelling, sore throat and [[fever]].<ref name=Aronson>Jeffrey K. Aronson. Meyler's Side Effects of Analgesics and Anti-inflammatory Drugs. Elsevier, 2009 {{ISBN|9780080932941}}</ref>{{rp|334}}  It has been associated with acute liver damage.<ref name=LiverTox/>

In 2008 the US label was updated with a warning concerning a risk of premature closure of the [[ductus arteriosus]] in pregnancy.<ref>FDA March 2008 [http://www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch/safetyinformation/safety-relateddruglabelingchanges/ucm116459.htm FDA advisory]</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Like other members of the anthranilic acid derivatives (or fenamate) class of [[NSAID]] drugs, it inhibits both isoforms of [[COX]]  and prevents formation of [[prostaglandins]].<ref name=LiverTox>NIH LiverTox Database [http://livertox.nih.gov/MefenamicAcid.htm Mefenamic Acid] Last updated June 23, 2015.

==History==
Scientists led by Claude Winder from [[Parke-Davis]] invented mefenamic acid in 1961, along with fellow members of the class of [[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug#Anthranilic acid derivatives .28Fenamates.29|anthranilic acid derivatives]], [[flufenamic acid]] in 1963 and [[meclofenamate sodium]] in 1964.<ref>Whitehouse M.

It was approved in the UK in 1963 as "Ponstan", in West Germany in 1964 as "Ponalar", and in France as "Ponstyl" and the US in 1967 as "Ponstel".<ref name=LiverTox/><ref name=Sittig>Marshall Sittig [http://files.rushim.ru/books/lekarstva/pharmaceutical-encyclopedia.pdf Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Encyclopedia  Volume 1 A-K] Second Edition, Reprint Edition.
