'''Tivozanib''' (AV-951) is an oral [[VEGF receptor]] [[tyrosine kinase]] inhibitor. It completed a trial investigation for the treatment of [[renal cell carcinoma]]s.<ref> 
Tivozanib is currently being evaluated in the pivotal Phase 3 TIVO-3 trial, a randomized, controlled, multi-center, open-label study to compare tivozanib to sorafenib in subjects with refractory advanced RCC. FDA approval is expected in 2018. [http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00502307 A Study of Tivozanib (AV-951), an Oral VEGF Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor, in the Treatment of Renal Cell Carcinoma], clinicaltrials.gov</ref>  The results did not result in FDA approval.

==Mechanism==
An oral [[quinoline]] [[urea]] derivative, tivozanib suppresses [[angiogenesis]] by being selectively inhibitory against [[vascular endothelial growth factor]].<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://journals.prous.com/journals/servlet/xmlxsl/pk_journals.xml_summary_pr?p_JournalId=2&p_RefId=1417872&p_IsPs=N | title = Tivozanib | author = Campas, C., Bolos, J., Castaner, R | journal = Drugs Fut | year = 2009 | volume = 34 | issue = 10 | pages = 793}}</ref> It was developed by [[AVEO Pharmaceuticals]].<ref>[https://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20100607-710196.html?mod=WSJ_latestheadlines Aveo Kidney Cancer Drug Shows Success; Shares Up], By John Kell, Dow Jones Newswires{{Dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref> It is designed to inhibit all three VEGF receptors.<ref name=Jan2012>{{cite news |url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/phase-iii-results-lead-aveo-and-astellas-to-plan-regulatory-submissions-for-tivozanib/81246145/ |title=Phase III Results Lead Aveo and Astellas to Plan Regulatory Submissions for Tivozanib |date=3 Jan 2012 }}</ref>
==Results==
Phase III results on advanced renal cell carcinoma suggested a 30% or 3 months improvement in median [[Progression-free survival|PFS]] compared to [[sorafenib]] but showed an inferior overall survival rate of the experimental arm versus the control arm.<ref name=Jan2012/><ref name=FDArejects/>  The [[Food and Drug Administration]]'s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee voted in May 2013 13 to 1 against recommending approval of tivozanib for renal cell carcinoma. The committee felt the drug failed to show a favorable risk-benefit ratio and questioned the equipose of the trial design, which allowed control arm patients who used [[sorafenib]] to transition to tivozanib following progression disease but not those on the experimental arm using tivozanib to transition to [[sorafenib]].  The [[new drug application|application]] was formally rejected by the FDA in June 2013, saying that approval would require additional clinical studies.<ref name=FDArejects>{{cite web | url = http://www.medpagetoday.com/HematologyOncology/RenalCellCarcinoma/39736 | title = FDA Rejects Renal Cancer Drug Tivozanib | publisher = MedPage Today | date = June 30, 2013}}</ref>

In 2016 AVEO Oncology published data in conjunction with the ASCO meeting showing a geographical location effect on Overall Survival in the Pivotal PhIII trial<ref>http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/165081-176</ref>

In 2016 AVEO Oncology announced the start of a second Pivotal PhIII clinical study in Third Line advanced RCC patients. <ref>http://investor.aveooncology.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=219651&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2172669</ref> 

In 2016 EUSA Pharma and AVEO Oncology announced that Tivozanib had been submitted to the European Medicines Agency for review under the Centralised Procedure. <ref>http://www.eusapharma.com/files/EUSA-Pharma-file-tivozanib-in-EU-March-2016.pdf</ref>

In June 2017 the EMA Scientific Committee recommended Tivozanib for approval in Europe, with approval expected in September.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/aveo-pharma-surges-62-on-recommendation-for-european-approval-of-its-cancer-drug-2017-06-23-8914126|title=AVEO Pharma surges 48% on recommendation for European approval of its cancer drug|last=|first=|date=June 28, 2017|work=Market Watch|access-date=June 28, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}</ref>
