'''Levallorphan''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]]) (brand names '''Lorfan''', '''Naloxifan''', '''Naloxiphan'''), also known as '''levallorphan tartrate''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]), is an [[opioid modulator]] of the [[morphinan]] family used as an [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] and [[opioid antagonist]]/[[antidote]].<ref name="Elks2014">{{cite book|author=J.

Levallorphan was formerly widely used in [[general anesthesia]], mainly to reverse the [[respiratory depression]] produced by opioid analgesics and [[barbiturate]]s used for induction of [[surgical anaesthesia]] whilst maintaining a degree of analgesia (via KOR agonism). It is now less commonly employed for this purpose as the newer drug [[naloxone]] tends to be used instead. Levallorphan was also used in combination with opioid analgesics to reduce their [[side effect]]s, mainly in [[obstetrics]], and a very small dose of levallorphan used alongside a [[full agonist]] of the MOR can produce greater analgesia than when the latter is used by itself.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bullough, J. | title =  Use of premixed pethidine and antagonists in obstetrical analgesia; with special reference to cases in which levallorphan was used | journal = British Medical Journal | year = 1959 | volume = 2 | issue = 5156 | pages = 859–862 | pmid = 13805887 | pmc = 1990381 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1990381/pdf/brmedj02943-0056.pdf | format = pdf | doi=10.1136/bmj.2.5156.859}}</ref> The combination of levallorphan with [[pethidine]] (meperidine) was indeed used so frequently, a standardized formulation was made available, known as '''Pethilorfan'''.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Williams, G. |author2=Cope, I. | title = An evaluation of a combination of pethidine and levallorphan ("pethilorfan") in labour | journal = The Medical Journal of Australia | year = 1962 | volume = 49 | issue = 2 | pages = 499–503 | pmid = 14000851 }}</ref>

As an agonist of the KOR, levallorphan can produce severe mental reactions at sufficient doses including [[hallucination]]s, [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]], and other [[psychotomimetic]] effects, [[dysphoria]], [[anxiety]], [[confusion]], [[dizziness]], [[disorientation]], [[derealization]], feelings of [[drunkenness]], [[delusion]]s, paranoia, and bizarre, unusual, or disturbing [[dream]]s.<ref name="Hall2012">{{cite book|author=R.C.W.
