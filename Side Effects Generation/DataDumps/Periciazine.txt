'''Periciazine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]), also known as '''pericyazine''' ([[British Approved Name|BAN]]) or '''propericiazine''', is a [[drug]] that belongs to the [[phenothiazine]] class of [[typical antipsychotic]]s.

Pericyazine is not approved for sale in the [[United States]]. It is commonly sold in [[Canada]] and [[Russia]] under the tradename '''Neuleptil''' and in [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]] under the tradename '''Neulactil'''.<ref name = Martindale>{{cite book|title=Pericyazine|work=Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference|publisher=The Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain|date=23 September 2011|accessdate=2 November 2013|url=http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/martindale/current/7082-t.htm}}</ref>

==Medical uses== 
The primary uses of pericyazine include in the short-term treatment of severe [[anxiety]] or tension and in the maintenance treatment of [[psychotic disorder]]s such as [[schizophrenia]]. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether periciazine is more or less effective than other antipsychotics.<ref name = TGA/> A 2014 [[systematic review]] compared pericyazine with typical antipsychotics for schizophrenia:

! Summary
|-
|On the basis of very low quality evidence it is not possible to determine the effects of pericyazine in comparison with antipsychotics such as [[Chlorpromazine|chlorpromazine]] or [[Trifluoperazine|trifluoperazine]] for the treatment of schizophrenia. There is some evidence, however, that pericyazine may be associated with a higher incidence of [[Extrapyramidal symptoms|extrapyramidal]] side effects than other antipsychotics.<ref name=Mat2014/>

Periciazine has also been studied in the treatment of [[opioid dependence]].<ref name="pmid10441864">{{cite journal |author=Sivolap IuP, Savchenkov VA |title=[The use of neuroleptics in treating opiate dependence] |language=Russian |journal=Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova |volume=99 |issue=6 |pages=29â€“34 |year=1999 |pmid=10441864 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Pericyazine is a rather [[sedation|sedating]] and [[anticholinergic]] [[antipsychotic]], and despite being classed with the typical antipsychotics, its risk of [[extrapyramidal symptoms|extrapyramidal side effects]] is comparatively low.<ref name = eTG>{{cite web|title=Approximate relative frequency (not intensity) of common adverse effects of antipsychotics (Table 8.21) [NB1]|date=February 2013|accessdate=2 November 2013|url=http://etg.tg.com.au/conc/desktop/index.htm?id=75114e7800512079b341de7fb82c953c|work=eTherapeutic Guidelines complete|publisher=Therapeutic Guidelines Limited}}</ref> It has a relatively high risk of causing [[hyperprolactinaemia]] and a moderate risk of causing [[weight gain]] and [[orthostatic hypotension]].<ref name = eTG/>
