'''Ipilimumab''' (trade name '''Yervoy''') is a [[monoclonal antibody]] that works to activate the [[immune system]] by targeting [[CTLA-4]], a protein receptor that downregulates the immune system.

[[Cytotoxic T lymphocytes]] (CTLs) can recognize and destroy cancer cells. However, an inhibitory mechanism interrupts this destruction. Ipilimumab turns off this inhibitory mechanism and allows CTLs to function.<ref name="Ribas"/>

Ipilimumab was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. FDA]] in 2011 for the treatment of [[melanoma]], a type of skin cancer.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lacroix|first1=Marc|title=Targeted Therapies in Cancer|date=2014|publisher=Nova Sciences Publishers|location=Hauppauge, NY|isbn=978-1-63321-687-7|url=https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=50994}}</ref><ref name="NYT-20150529">{{cite news |last=Pollack |first=Andrew |title=New Class of Drugs Shows More Promise in Treating Cancer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/30/business/new-class-of-drugs-shows-more-promise-in-treating-cancer.html |date=May 29, 2015 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=May 30, 2015 }}</ref> It is undergoing [[clinical trial]]s for the treatment of [[non-small cell lung carcinoma]] (NSCLC), [[small cell lung cancer]] (SCLC),<ref name="NCT735">{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00527735}} Phase II Study for Previously Untreated Subjects With Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) or Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)</ref> [[bladder cancer]]<ref name="NCT991">[https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01524991 First-Line Gemcitabine, Cisplatin + Ipilimumab for Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma]{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT01524991}}</ref> and metastatic hormone-refractory [[prostate cancer]].<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00323882}} Phase I/II Study of MDX-010 in Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer (MDX010-21) (COMPLETED)</ref>

Cancer cells produce antigens, which the immune system can use to identify them. These antigens are recognized by [[dendritic cells]] that present the antigens to [[cytotoxic T lymphocytes]] (CTLs) in the [[lymph nodes]]. The CTLs recognize the cancer cells by those antigens and destroy them. However, along with the antigens, the dendritic cells present an inhibitory signal. That signal binds to a receptor, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 ([[CTLA-4]]), on the CTL and turns off the cytotoxic reaction. This allows the cancer cells to survive.<ref name="Ribas"/>

Ipilimumab binds to CTLA-4, blocking the inhibitory signal, which allows the CTLs to destroy the cancer cells.<ref name="Ribas"/><ref name="pmid20616954">{{cite journal |vauthors=Tarhini AA, Iqbal F | title = CTLA-4 blockade: therapeutic potential in cancer treatments | journal = Onco Targets Ther | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 15–25 | year = 2010 | id =  | pmc = 2895779 | doi = 10.2147/ott.s4833| url = | issn = | pmid=20616954}}</ref><ref name="pmid19648604">{{cite journal |vauthors=Robert C, Ghiringhelli F | title = What is the role of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 blockade in patients with metastatic melanoma? | journal = Oncologist | volume = 14 | issue = 8 | pages = 848–61 |date=August 2009 | id =  | doi = 10.1634/theoncologist.2009-0028 | url = | issn = | pmid=19648604}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Gail M.

== Identifying patients most likely to respond ==
During “cancer immunoediting", tumor cells can produce antigens that provoke a reduced immune response and/or establish an immunosuppressive [[tumor microenvironment]] (TME). The latter can arise as a consequence of repeated, ineffective T cell stimulation. This triggers the checkpoint that ipilumumab targets. Many patients do not benefit from treatment, which may be related to reduced mutation load and/or missense point mutation-derived neoantigens. Tumor antigens can either be improperly expressed normal proteins or abnormal proteins with tumor-specific expression. Somatic cancer mutations can produce “nonself” tumor-specific mutant antigens (neoantigens).<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|title = The odds of immunotherapy success|url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/350/6257/158|journal = Science|date = 2015-10-09|issn = 0036-8075|pmid = 26450194|pages = 158–159|volume = 350|issue = 6257|doi = 10.1126/science.aad4140|first = Matthew M.|last = Gubin|first2 = Robert D.|last2 = Schreiber}}</ref>

Sequencing and [[epitope]] prediction algorithms identified neoantigens in mouse tumors that functioned as tumor-specific T cell targets. Neoantigens were recognized by T cells in melanoma patients and were likely the major contributor to positive clinical effects of [[adoptive cell transfer]]. Mouse models established that neoantigens were the targets of T cells activated by checkpoint blockade therapy and that synthetic long [[peptides]] comprising these neoantigens were effective when administered as vaccines with CTLA-4 and/or PD-1 mAbs. Cancers with higher mutation burdens, and an associated likelihood of expressing neoantigens, appear most likely to respond to checkpoint therapy. In melanoma and certain other cancers, the numbers of mutations and neoantigens correlate with patient response. Increased PD ligand 2 (PD-L2) transcript expression and an immune “cytolytic” gene signature also correlated with neoantigen load and tumor response. CTLA-4 expression  was a response indicator, which along with PD-L2 were likely expressed in tumor-infiltrating immune cells. An inflamed TME prior to treatment is also associated with response.<ref name=":1" />

Nearly all neoantigens in one study were patient-specific and most likely reflected mutations that do not directly contribute to tumorigenesis. However, none revealed features or motifs exclusive to responders.<ref name=":1" />

On December 10, 2007, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Medarex released the results of three studies on ipilimumab for melanoma.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medarex.com/cgi-local/item.pl/20071210-1085876 |title=Top-Line Data Available from Three Ipilimumab Pivotal Trials in Patients with Advanced Metastatic Melanoma |date=2007-12-10 |publisher=Medarex, Inc. |accessdate=2009-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020042102/http://www.medarex.com/cgi-local/item.pl/20071210-1085876 |archivedate=October 20, 2008 }}</ref> The three studies tested 487 patients with advanced skin cancer. One of the three studies failed to meet its primary goal of shrinking tumors in at least 10.0% of the study's 155 patients. <!-- Side effects are often considered acceptable risks for cancer drugs given the severity of the disease, and ipilimumab is no exception.--> Side effects included rashes, diarrhea, and hepatitis. <!-- Despite the weaker-than-anticipated results, the companies are still planning to meet with regulatory agencies to discuss moving ahead with the medication since patients suffering from extremely serious diseases like melanoma have so few treatment options, the companies believe that even the marginal success rate will be appealing to some. -->

In 2010, a study was presented that showed a median survival of 10 months in advanced melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab, compared with 6 months for those treated with [[Gp100:209-217(210M)|gp100]], an experimental vaccine (n=676).

===Lung cancer===
Medarex ran a phase II trial of ipilimumab in addition to platinum-based chemotherapy ([[carboplatin]]) in patients with small cell and non-small cell lung cancer.<ref name=NCT735/> It was scheduled to run from February 2008 to December 2011.{{update section|date=March 2016}}

===Bladder cancer===
Early results of a trial in [[urothelial carcinoma]] have been reported.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/153523-156|title=Impact of gemcitabine + cisplatin + ipilimumab on circulating immune cells in patients (pts) with metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC). - 2015 ASCO Annual Meeting - Abstracts - Meeting Library|publisher=}}</ref>

== Combination trials ==

===Advanced melanoma===

To increase response rate and reduce adverse reactions, various drug combinations are being tested.

In 2013 a trial was running that compared ipilimumab alone against ipilimumab in combination with [[nivolumab]].  The response rate (tumours shrinking by at least 30%) was 58% for the combination, 44% for nivolumab alone, and 19% for ipilimumab alone.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/behindtheheadlines/news/2015-06-01-immunotherapy-drug-combo-could-combat-melanoma/|title=Immunotherapy drug combo could combat melanoma|author=pmhdev|work=PubMed Health}}</ref> This combination gained FDA approval for melanoma in Oct 2015.

In March 2014, an open-label, randomized, two agent, single center trial started combining ipilimumab with [[phosphatidylserine]]-targeting immunotherapy [[bavituximab]] for the treatment of advanced melanoma. The number of treated patients in arm A (ipilimumab plus bavituximab) was to be 16, with 8 in arm B (ipilimumab only). The trial was expected to complete in March 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Two-arm, Single Center Phase 1b Trial of Bavituximab Plus Ipilimumab in Advanced Melanoma Patients|publisher=ClinicalTrials.gov|url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01984255?term=bavituximab&rank=16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Peregrine Pharmaceuticals Announces Initiation of an Investigator-Sponsored Trial Combining Its Immunotherapy Bavituximab and Ipilimumab (Yervoy®) in Advanced Melanoma|publisher=Peregrine Pharmaceuticals, Inc|url=http://ir.peregrineinc.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=841892}}</ref> Previous, preclinical studies showed that PS targeting antibodies (such as bavituximab) enhance the anti-tumor activity of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 antibodies. Tumor growth inhibition correlates with infiltration of immune cells in tumors and induction of adaptive immunity. The combination of these mechanisms promotes strong, localized, anti-tumor responses without the side-effects of systemic immune activation.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/09/idUSnMKWDgVlta+1e8+MKW20140409 | title = Data Presented at AACR Support Potential of Peregrine's PS-Targeting Immunotherapy Bavituximab to Enhance Anti-Tumor and Immune-Stimulating Effects of Anti-CTLA-4 and Anti-PD-1 Treatments in Models of Melanoma and Colon Cancer | date = 2014-04-09 | publisher = Reuters | accessdate = 2014-04-09}}</ref> {{Update|section|date=May 2014}}
