'''Lisinopril''' is a drug of the [[ACE inhibitor|angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor]] class used primarily in treatment of [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[heart failure]], and after [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]]. It is also used for preventing [[kidney]] and [[retina|eye]] complications in people with [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]]. Its indications, [[contraindication]]s, and side effects are as those for all [[ACE inhibitor]]s.

Lisinopril was the third ACE inhibitor (after [[captopril]] and [[enalapril]]) and was introduced into therapy in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Patchett A | title = A new class of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors | journal = Nature | volume = 288 | issue = 5788 | pages = 280–3 | year = 1980 | pmid = 6253826 | doi = 10.1038/288280a0|display-authors=etal| bibcode = 1980Natur.288..280P }}</ref> A number of properties distinguish it from other ACE inhibitors: It is [[Hydrophile|hydrophilic]], has a long [[half-life]] and tissue penetration, and is not [[metabolism|metabolized]] by the liver.

== Medical uses ==
Lisinopril is typically used for the treatment of [[hypertension]], [[congestive heart failure]], [[acute myocardial infarction]], and [[diabetic nephropathy]].<ref name=AHFS>{{cite web|title=Lisinopril|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/lisinopril.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref>

== Contraindications ==
Treatment with lisinopril should be avoided for people who have a history of [[angioedema]] ([[hereditary]] or [[idiopathic]]) or who have diabetes and are taking [[aliskiren]].<ref name=Label>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2015/019777s073lbl.pdf Lisinopril label] Revised: 08/2015</ref>

== Adverse effects ==
[[Adverse effects|Side effects]], incidence differs depending on which disease state the patient is being treated for.<ref name=Label />

People taking lisinopril for the treatment of [[hypertension]] may experience the following side effects:
* Headache (3.8%)
* Dizziness (3.5%)
* Cough (2.5%)
* Difficulty swallowing or breathing (signs of [[angioedema]]), [[allergic reaction]] ([[anaphylaxis]])
* [[Hyperkalemia]] (2.2% in adult clinical trials)
* Fatigue (1% or more)
* Diarrhea (1% or more)
* Some severe skin reactions have been reported rarely, including toxic epidermal necrolysis and [[Stevens-Johnson syndrome]]; causal relationship has not been established.

People taking lisinopril for the treatment of [[myocardial infarction]] may experience the following side effects:
* [[Hypotension]] (5.3%)
* Renal dysfunction (1.3%)
People taking lisinopril for the treatment of [[heart failure]] may experience the following side effects:
* [[Hypotension]] (3.8%)
* Dizziness (12% at low dose – 19% at high dose)
* Chest pain (2.1%)
* [[Syncope (medicine)|Fainting]] (5-7%)
* [[Hyperkalemia]] (3.5% at low dose – 6.4% at high dose)
* Difficulty swallowing or breathing (signs of [[angioedema]]), [[allergic reaction]] ([[anaphylaxis]])
* Fatigue (1% or more)
* Diarrhea (1% or more)
* Some severe skin reactions have been reported rarely, including toxic epidermal necrolysis and [[Stevens-Johnson syndrome]]; causal relationship has not been established.

== Special populations ==
Caution should be used in the following populations, as dose adjustments may be required.

=== Kidney problems ===
The dose must be adjusted in those with poor kidney function. Dose adjustments may be required when [[creatinine clearance]] is less than or equal to 30mL/min. Since lisinopril is removed by [[dialysis]], dosing changes must also be considered for people on dialysis.<ref name=Label />

=== Pregnancy and breastfeeding ===
Lisinopril has been assigned to [[pregnancy category]] D by the FDA. Animal and human data have revealed evidence of lethal harm to the embryo and [[teratology|teratogenicity]] associated with ACE inhibitors. No controlled data in human pregnancy are available. Birth defects have been associated with use of lisinopril in any trimester. However, there have been reports of death and increased toxicities to the fetus and newly born child with the use of lisinopril in the second and third trimesters. The label states, "When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Zestril as soon as possible." The manufacturer recommends mothers should not breastfeed while taking this medication because of the lack of safety data that currently exists.<ref name=Label />
[[File:003782076lg Lisinopril Lisinopril 40 MG Oral Tablet.jpg|thumb|Lisinopril 40-mg oral tablet]]

== Pharmacology ==
Lisinopril is the [[lysine]]-analog of [[enalapril]]. Unlike other ACE inhibitors, it is not a [[prodrug]] and is excreted unchanged in the urine. In cases of [[Therapeutic window|overdosage]], it can be removed from circulation by [[dialysis]].<ref name=Label />

=== Mechanism of action ===
Lisinopril is an [[ACE inhibitor|ACE Inhibitor]], meaning it blocks the actions of [[Angiotensin-converting enzyme|angiotensin converting enzyme]] (ACE) in the [[Renin–angiotensin system|renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system]] (RAAS), keeping [[Angiotensin]] I from being converted to [[Angiotensin II]].  The inhibition of this system causes an overall decrease in blood pressure.<ref name=":1" />

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
The following is a summary of lisinopril's [[pharmacokinetics]]:<ref name=Label /><ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title = Basic and Clinical Pharmacology|last = Katzung|first = Bertram|publisher = McGraw Hill|year = 2012|isbn = 978-0-07-176401-8|location = New York City, New York|pages = 175, 184–85}}</ref>

'''Absorption'''
* Lisinopril has a poor [[bioavailability]] of 25% (Reduced to 16% in people with [[New York Heart Association Functional Classification|NYHA]] Class II-IV heart failure)
* Time to peak concentration is 7 hours
* Food has not been shown to affect absorption

'''Distribution'''
* Does not bind to proteins in the blood
* Lisinopril does not distribute as well in people with NYHA Class II–IV heart failure

'''Metabolism'''
* Lisinopril does not undergo any form of metabolism in the body

'''Elimination'''
* Lisinopril leaves the body completely unchanged in the urine
* The [[half-life]] of the drug is 12 hours. This is increased in people with kidney problems

== History ==
[[Captopril]], the first ACE inhibitor, is a [[Functional analog (chemistry)|functional]] and [[structural analog]] of a [[peptide]] derived from the venom of the jararaca, a Brazilian pit viper (''[[Bothrops jararaca]]'').<ref name=Patlak>{{cite journal | author = Patlak M | title = From viper's venom to drug design: treating hypertension | journal = FASEB J. | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | page = 421 |date=March 2004 | pmid = 15003987 | doi = 10.1096/fj.03-1398bkt }}</ref> [[Enalapril]] is a derivative, designed by scientists at Merck to overcome the rash and bad taste caused by captopril.<ref>Jenny Bryan for ''The Pharmaceutical Journal'', 17 Apr 2009 [http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/news-and-analysis/news/from-snake-venom-to-ace-inhibitor-the-discovery-and-rise-of-captopril/10884359.article "From snake venom to ACE inhibitor—the discovery and rise of captopril"]</ref><ref name=HistDD>Jie Jack Li, "History of Drug Discovery".

Scientists at Merck created lisinopril by systematically altering each structural unit of enalaprilat, substituting various amino acids. It turned out that adding [[lysine]] at one end of the drug had strong activity and was orally available; analogs of that compounds resulted in lisonopril, which takes its name from the discovery with lysine.  Merck conducted clinical trials, and the drug was approved for hypertension in 1987 and congestive heart failure in 1993.<ref name=Menard />

The discovery posed a problem, since sales of enalapril were strong for Merck, and the company didn't want to diminish those sales. Merck ended up entering into an agreement with [[Zeneca]] under which Zeneca received the right to co-market lisinopril, and Merck received the exclusive rights to an earlier stage [[aldose reductase inhibitor]] drug candidate, a potential treatment for diabetes.  Zeneca's marketing and brand name, "Zestril", turned out to be stronger than Merck's effort.<ref>David R. Glover. ''Vie D’or: Memoirs of a Pharmaceutical Physician''.
