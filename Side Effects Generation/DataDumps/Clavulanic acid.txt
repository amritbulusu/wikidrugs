'''Clavulanic acid''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|l|æ|v|j|ə|ˈ|l|æ|n|ɪ|k}}) is a [[β-lactam antibiotic|β-lactam drug]] that functions as a [[Suicide inhibition|mechanism-based]] [[β-lactamase inhibitor]].  While not effective by itself as an [[antibiotic]], when combined with [[penicillin]]-group antibiotics, it can overcome [[antibiotic resistance]] in [[bacteria]] that secrete [[Beta-lactamase|β-lactamase]], which otherwise inactivates most penicillins.

In its most common form, the potassium salt '''potassium clavulanate''' is combined with:
* [[amoxicillin]] ([[co-amoxiclav]], trade names Augmentin, Tyclav, Synulox ([[veterinary]]), and others)
* [[ticarcillin]] ([[co-ticarclav]], trade name Timentin)

Clavulanic acid is an example of a [[clavam]].

Clavulanic acid was patented in 1974.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fischer|first1=Janos|last2=Ganellin|first2=C. Robin|title=Analogue-based Drug Discovery|date=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9783527607495|page=490|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=FjKfqkaKkAAC&pg=PA490|language=en}}</ref>

==Uses==

For the treatment of [[pyelonephritis]] during pregnancy, and for the treatment of pyelonephritis caused by gram-positive organisms, amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium is preferred.

Clavulanic acid is [[biosynthesis|biosynthesized]] from the amino acid [[arginine]] and the sugar [[glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate]].  With the [[β-lactam]] like structure, clavulanic acid looks structurally similar to [[penicillin]], but the biosynthesis of this molecule involves a different pathway and set of enzymes.  Clavulanic acid is biosynthesized by the bacterium ''[[Streptomyces clavuligerus]]'', using [[glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate]] and [[arginine|<small>L</small>-arginine]] as the starting materials of the pathway.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Reading|first1=C.|last2=Cole|first2=M.|title=Clavulanic Acid: a Beta-Lactamase-Inhibiting Beta-Lactam from Streptomyces clavuligerus|journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy|date=1 May 1977|volume=11|issue=5|pages=852–857|doi=10.1128/AAC.11.5.852|pmid=879738|pmc=352086}}</ref>  Although all of the intermediates of the pathway are known, the exact mechanism of each enzymatic reaction is not fully understood.  The biosynthesis mainly involves 3 enzymes: [[clavaminate synthase]], β-lactam synthetase and [[N2-(2-carboxyethyl)arginine synthase|N<sup>2</sup>-(2-carboxyethyl)-L-arginine synthase]](CEA).<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
[[Clavaminate synthase]] is a non-heme iron [[Alpha-ketoglutarate|α-keto-glutarate]] dependent [[oxygenase]] that is encoded by orf5 of the clavulanic acid [[gene cluster]].  The specific mechanism of how this enzyme works is not fully understood, but this enzyme regulates 3 steps in the overall synthesis of clavulanic acid.  All 3 steps occur in the same region of the catalytic iron center, yet do not occur in-sequence and affect different areas of the clavulanic acid structure.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Busby|first1=RW|last2=Townsend|first2=CA|title=A single monomeric iron center in clavaminate synthase catalyzes three nonsuccessive oxidative transformations.|journal=Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry|date=Jul 1996|volume=4|issue=7|pages=1059–64|pmid=8831977|doi=10.1016/0968-0896(96)00088-0}}</ref>

β-lactam synthetase is a 54.5 kDa protein that is encoded by orf3 of the clavulanic acid [[gene cluster]], and shows similarity to [[Asparagine synthase (glutamine-hydrolysing)|asparagine synthase]] – Class B enzymes.  The exact mechanism on how this enzyme works to synthesize the [[β-lactam]] is not proven, but is believed to occur in coordination with a CEA synthase and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bachmann|first1=BO|last2=Townsend|first2=CA|title=Kinetic mechanism of the beta-lactam synthetase of Streptomyces clavuligerus.|journal=Biochemistry|date=Sep 19, 2000|volume=39|issue=37|pages=11187–93|pmid=10985764|doi=10.1021/bi000709i}}</ref>

CEA synthase is a 60.9 kDA protein and is the first gene found in the clavulanic acid biosynthesis [[gene cluster]], encoded by orf2 of the clavulanic acid [[gene cluster]]. The specific mechanism of how this enzyme works is still under investigation; however, it is known that this enzyme has the ability to couple together [[glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate]] with [[L-arginine]] in the presence of thiamine diphosphate (TDP or [[thiamine pyrophosphate]]), which is the first step of the clavulanic acid biosynthesis.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Khaleeli|first1=Nusrat|last2=Li|first2=Rongfeng|last3=Townsend|first3=Craig A.|title=Origin of the β-Lactam Carbons in Clavulanic Acid from an Unusual Thiamine Pyrophosphate-Mediated Reaction|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=121|issue=39|pages=9223–9224|doi=10.1021/ja9923134}}</ref>

== History ==
Clavulanic acid was discovered around 1974/75 by British scientists working at the drug company [[Beecham (pharmaceutical company)|Beecham]] from the bacteria Streptomyces clavuligerus.
After several attempts, Beecham finally filed for [[US patent]] protection for the drug in 1981, and U.S. Patents 4,525,352, 4,529,720, and 4,560,552 were granted in 1985.

Clavulanic acid has negligible intrinsic antimicrobial activity, despite sharing the β-lactam ring that is characteristic of [[β-lactam antibiotic]]s. However, the similarity in chemical structure allows the molecule to interact with the enzyme [[Beta-lactamase|β-lactamase]] secreted by certain bacteria to confer resistance to β-lactam antibiotics.

Clavulanic acid is a [[suicide inhibitor]], covalently bonding to a [[serine]] residue in the [[active site]] of the β-lactamase. This restructures the clavulanic acid molecule, creating a much more reactive species that attacks another amino acid in the active site, permanently inactivating it, and thus inactivating the enzyme.

This inhibition restores the antimicrobial activity of β-lactam antibiotics against lactamase-secreting resistant bacteria. Despite this, some bacterial strains that are resistant even to such combinations have emerged.

== Adverse effects ==
The use of clavulanic acid with penicillins has been associated with an increased incidence of [[cholestasis|cholestatic jaundice]] and acute [[hepatitis]] during therapy or shortly after. The associated jaundice is usually self-limiting and very rarely fatal.<ref>Joint Formulary Committee. [[British National Formulary]], 47th edition. London: British Medical Association and Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain; 2004.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://livertox.nih.gov/AmoxicillinClavulanate.htm|title=Drug Record - Amoxicillin-Clavulanate|work=LiverTox - Clinical and Research Information on Drug-Induced Liver Injury|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}</ref>
 
The [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[Committee on Safety of Medicines]] (CSM) recommends that treatments such as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid preparations be reserved for bacterial infections likely to be caused by amoxicillin-resistant β-lactamase-producing strains, and that treatment should not normally exceed 14 days.
