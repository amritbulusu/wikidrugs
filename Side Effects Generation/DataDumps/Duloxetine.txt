'''Duloxetine''', sold under the brand name '''Cymbalta''' among others,<ref name=generics/> is a medication mostly used for [[major depressive disorder]], [[generalized anxiety disorder]], [[fibromyalgia]] and [[neuropathic pain]].<ref name="AHFS2015" />

It is a [[thiophene]] derivative and a selective neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitor for serotonin, norepinephrine, and to a lesser degree dopamine. It belongs to a class of heterocyclic antidepressants known as [[serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s (SNRIs).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/#/record/ui?ui=D000068736|title=MeSH Browser|website=meshb.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2016-11-28}}</ref> It was originally made by [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]].

A 2014 [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane]] review concluded that duloxetine is beneficial in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy and fibromyalgia but that more comparative studies with other medicines are needed.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lunn MP, Hughes RA, Wiffen PJ |title=Duloxetine for treating painful neuropathy, chronic pain or fibromyalgia |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=1 |issue= 1|pages=CD007115 |year=2014 |pmid=24385423 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007115.pub3 |url=}}</ref> The French medical journal ''[[Prescrire]]'' concluded that duloxetine is no better than other available agents and has a greater risk of side effects.<ref name=Pres2014>{{cite journal|title=Towards better patient care: drugs to avoid in 2014|journal=Prescrire International|date=June 2014|volume=23|issue=150|pages=161–165|url=http://english.prescrire.org/en/81/168/49342/0/NewsDetails.aspx|pmid=25121155}}</ref> Thus they recommend against its general use.<ref name=Pres2014/>

===Major depressive disorder===
Duloxetine was approved for the treatment of major depression in 2004. While duloxetine has demonstrated improvement in depression-related symptoms compared to [[placebo]], comparisons of duloxetine to other antidepressant medications have been less successful. A 2012 Cochrane Review did not find greater efficacy of duloxetine compared to SSRIs and newer antidepressants. Additionally, the review found evidence that duloxetine has increased side effects and reduced tolerability compared to other antidepressants. It thus did not recommend duloxetine as a first line treatment for major depressive disorder, given the (then) high cost of duloxetine compared to inexpensive off-patent antidepressants and lack of increased efficacy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cipriani|first=A|author2=Koesters, M |author3=Furukawa, TA |author4=Nosè, M |author5=Purgato, M |author6=Omori, IM |author7=Trespidi, C |author8= Barbui, C |title=Duloxetine versus other anti-depressive agents for depression|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=Oct 17, 2012|volume=10|pages=CD006533|pmid=23076926|pmc=4169791|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd006533.pub2}}</ref> Generic duloxetine became available in 2013.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Loss of Cymbalta patent a major blow for Eli Lilly |journal=Indianapolis Star |date=2013-10-13 |last=Swiatek |first=Jeff |url=http://www.indystar.com/story/money/2013/12/10/loss-of-cymbalta-patent-a-major-blow-for-eli-lilly/3956997/ |accessdate=2015-02-27 }}</ref>

===Diabetic peripheral neuropathy===
Duloxetine was approved for the pain associated with diabetic [[peripheral neuropathy]] (DPN), based on the positive results of two clinical trials. The average daily pain was measured using an 11-point scale, and duloxetine treatment resulted in an additional 1–1.7 points decrease of pain as compared with placebo.<ref name =FDA_DPN>{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/nda/2004/021733s000_Cymbalta_medr.pdf | title =Application number 21-733.

Duloxetine slightly increased the fasting [[serum glucose]]; however this effect was deemed to be of "minimal clinical significance".<ref name =FDA_DPN/>

The comparative efficacy of duloxetine and established pain-relief medications for DPN is unclear. A systematic review noted that [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s ([[imipramine]] and [[amitriptyline]]), traditional [[anticonvulsant]]s and [[opioid]]s have better efficacy than duloxetine. Duloxetine, tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants have similar tolerability while the opioids caused more side effects.<ref name="pmid17562735">{{cite journal |author=Wong MC, Chung JW, Wong TK |title=Effects of treatments for symptoms of painful diabetic neuropathy: systematic review |journal=BMJ |volume=335 |issue=7610 |page=87 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17562735 |pmc=1914460 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39213.565972.AE |url=|last2=Chung |last3=Wong }}</ref> Another review in ''Prescrire International'' considered the moderate pain relief achieved with duloxetine to be clinically insignificant and the results of the clinical trials unconvincing.

===Stress urinary incontinence===
Duloxetine failed to receive US approval for [[stress incontinence|stress urinary incontinence]] amid concerns over liver toxicity and suicidal events; however, it was approved for this use in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], where it is recommended as an add-on medication in stress urinary incontinence instead of surgery.<ref>{{NICE|40|Urinary incontinence|2006}}</ref>

The safety and utility of duloxetine in the treatment of incontinence has been evaluated in a series of meta analyses and practice guidelines.

* A 2017 meta-analysis found that harms are at least as great if not greater than the benefits.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Maund|first1=E|last2=Guski|first2=LS|last3=Gøtzsche|first3=PC|title=Considering benefits and harms of duloxetine for treatment of stress urinary incontinence: a meta-analysis of clinical study reports.|journal=CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal <nowiki>=</nowiki> journal de l'Association medicale canadienne|date=6 February 2017|volume=189|issue=5|pages=E194–E203|pmid=28246265}}</ref>
* A 2013 [[meta-analysis]] concluded that duloxetine decreased incontinence episodes more than placebo with people about 56% more likely than placebo to experience a 50% decrease in episodes. Adverse effects were experienced by 83% of duloxetine-treated subjects and by 45% of placebo-treated subjects.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Li J, Yang L, Pu C, Tang Y, Yun H, Han P |title=The role of duloxetine in stress urinary incontinence: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Int Urol Nephrol |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=679–86 |date=June 2013  |pmid=23504618 |doi=10.1007/s11255-013-0410-6 |url=|last2=Yang |last3=Pu |last4=Tang |last5=Yun |last6=Han }}</ref>
* A 2012 review and practice guideline published by the [[European Association of Urology]] concluded that the clinical trial data provides Grade 1a evidence that duloxetine improves but does not cure urinary incontinence, and that it causes a high rate of gastrointestinal side effects (mainly nausea and vomiting) leading to a high rate of treatment discontinuation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uroweb.org/gls/pdf/20%20Urinary%20Incontinence_LR.pdf|title=www.uroweb.org|format=|work=|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504105841/http://www.uroweb.org/gls/pdf/20%20Urinary%20Incontinence_LR.pdf|archivedate=2014-05-04|df=}}</ref>
* The National Institute for Clinical and Health Excellence recommends (as of September 2013) that duloxetine not be routinely offered as first line treatment, and that it only be offered as second line therapy in women wishing to avoid therapy.  The guideline further states that women should be counseled regarding the drug's side effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publications.nice.org.uk/urinary-incontinence-cg171|title=Urinary incontinence Introduction CG171|format=|work=|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504105632/http://publications.nice.org.uk/urinary-incontinence-cg171|archivedate=2014-05-04|df=}}</ref>

==Contraindications==
The following [[contraindication]]s are listed by the manufacturer:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cymbalta.com/learnaboutcymbalta/importantsafetyinformation.jsp|title=Eli Lilly and Company|publisher=}}</ref>
* Hypersensitivity: duloxetine is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to duloxetine or any of the inactive ingredients.
* [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAOIs): concomitant use in patients taking MAOIs is contraindicated.
* Uncontrolled narrow-angle [[glaucoma]]: in [[clinical trials]], Cymbalta use was associated with an increased risk of [[mydriasis]] (dilation of the pupil); therefore, its use should be avoided in patients with uncontrolled narrow-angle [[glaucoma]], in which mydriasis can cause sudden worsening.
* [[Central nervous system]] (CNS) acting drugs: given the primary CNS effects of duloxetine, it should be used with caution when it is taken in combination with or substituted for other centrally acting drugs, including those with a similar mechanism of action.
* Duloxetine and [[thioridazine]] should not be co-administered.
In addition, the FDA has reported on life-threatening drug interactions that may be possible when co-administered with triptans and other drugs acting on serotonin pathways leading to increased risk for [[serotonin syndrome]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Report a Serious Problem |url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm124915.htm |title=Information for Healthcare Professionals: Duloxetine (marketed as Cymbalta) – Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) or Selective Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) and 5-Hydroxytryptamine Receptor Agonists (Triptans) |publisher=Fda.gov |date=2013-08-14 |accessdate=2013-09-18}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
[[Nausea]], [[somnolence]], [[insomnia]], and [[dizziness]] are the main [[side effects]], reported by about 10% to 20% of patients.<ref>Cymbalta package insert. Indianapolis, IN: Eli Lilly Pharmaceuticals; 2004, September.</ref>

In a trial for major depressive disorder (MDD), the most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events among duloxetine-treated patients were [[nausea]] (34.7%), [[dry mouth]] (22.7%), [[headache]] (20.0%) and [[dizziness]] (18.7%), and except for [[headache]], these were reported significantly more often than in the placebo group.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Perahia DG, Kajdasz DK, Walker DJ, Raskin J, Tylee A |title=Duloxetine 60 mg once daily in the treatment of milder major depressive disorder |journal=Int.

[[Sexual dysfunction]] is often a side effect of drugs that inhibit serotonin reuptake. Specifically, common side effects include difficulty becoming aroused, lack of interest in sex, and [[anorgasmia]] (trouble achieving orgasm). Loss of or decreased response to sexual stimuli and ejaculatory [[anhedonia]] are also possible.

===Discontinuation syndrome===
{{Further information|SSRI discontinuation syndrome}}
During marketing of other SSRIs and SNRIs, there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: [[Dysphoria|dysphoric mood]], irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., [[paresthesias]] such as [[brain zap]] electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, [[Labile affect|emotional lability]], [[insomnia]], [[hypomania]], [[tinnitus]], and seizures. The [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] syndrome from duloxetine resembles the [[SSRI discontinuation syndrome]].

When discontinuing treatment with duloxetine, the manufacturer recommends a gradual reduction in the dose, rather than abrupt cessation, whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate.

In placebo-controlled clinical trials of up to nine weeks' duration of patients with MDD, a systematic evaluation of discontinuation symptoms in patients taking duloxetine following abrupt discontinuation found the following symptoms occurring at a rate greater than or equal to 2% and at a significantly higher rate in duloxetine-treated patients compared to those discontinuing from placebo: dizziness, nausea, headache, paresthesia, vomiting, irritability, and nightmare.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Perahia DG, Kajdasz DK, Desaiah D, Haddad PM |title=Symptoms following abrupt discontinuation of duloxetine treatment in patients with major depressive disorder |journal=J Affect Disord |volume=89 |issue=1–3 |pages=207–12 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16266753 |doi=10.1016/j.jad.2005.09.003|last2=Kajdasz |last3=Desaiah |last4=Haddad }}</ref>

===Suicidality===
The FDA requires all antidepressants, including duloxetine, to carry a [[black box warning]] stating that antidepressants may increase the risk of suicide in persons younger than 25. This warning is based on statistical analyses conducted by two independent groups of the FDA experts that found a 2-fold increase of the suicidal ideation and behavior in children and adolescents, and 1.5-fold increase of suicidality in the 18–24 age group.<ref name="FDA">{{cite web |vauthors=Levenson M, Holland C | title = Antidepressants and Suicidality in Adults: Statistical Evaluation.

To obtain [[statistically significant]] results the FDA had to combine the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants for psychiatric indications. As [[suicidal ideation]] and behavior in clinical trials are rare, the results for any drug taken separately usually do not reach statistical significance.

In 2005 the United States FDA released a public health advisory noting that there had been 11 reports of suicide attempts and 3 reports of suicidality within the mostly middle-aged women participating in the open label extension trials of duloxetine for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence. The FDA described the potential role of confounding social stressors "unclear". The suicide attempt rate in the SUI study population (based on 9,400 patients) was calculated to be 400 per 100,000 person years. This rate is greater than the suicide attempt rate among middle-aged U.S. women that has been reported in published studies, i.e., 150 to 160 per 100,000 person years. In addition, one death from suicide was reported in a Cymbalta clinical pharmacology study in a healthy female volunteer without SUI. No increase in suicidality was reported in controlled trials of Cymbalta for depression or diabetic neuropathic pain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm114970.htm |title=Historical Information on Duloxetine hydrochloride (marketed as Cymbalta) |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

===Postmarketing reports===
Reported adverse events which were temporally correlated to duloxetine therapy include rash, reported rarely, and the following adverse events, reported very rarely: [[alanine aminotransferase]] increased, [[alkaline phosphatase]] increased, [[anaphylactic]] reaction, [[angioneurotic edema]], [[aspartate aminotransferase]] increased, [[bilirubin]] increased, [[glaucoma]], [[hepatotoxicity]], [[hyponatremia]], [[jaundice]], [[orthostatic hypotension]] (especially at the initiation of treatment), [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]], [[syncope (medicine)|syncope]] (especially at initiation of treatment), and [[urticaria]].<ref>[http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/cymbalta_ad.htm] Duloxetine Side Effects, and Drug Interactions – RxList Monographs</ref>

Duloxetine inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine (NE) in the central nervous system. Duloxetine increases dopamine (DA) specifically in the prefrontal cortex, where there are few DA reuptake pumps, via the inhibition of NE reuptake pumps (NET) which is believed to mediate reuptake of DA and NE.<ref>Stahl, S. (2013). Stahl's essential pharmacology, 4th ed. Cambridge University Press, New York. p. 305, 308, 309.</ref>  However, duloxetine has no significant affinity for dopaminergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, opioid, glutamate, and GABA reuptake transporters and can therefore be considered to be a selective reuptake inhibitor at the 5-HT and NE transporters. Duloxetine undergoes extensive [[metabolism]], but the major circulating metabolites do not contribute significantly to the pharmacologic activity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stahl|first=SM|author2=Grady, Moret, Briley|title=SNRIs: their pharmacology, clinical efficacy, and tolerability in comparison with other classes of antidepressants|journal=CNS Spectrums|date=Sep 2005|volume=10|issue=9|pages=732–747|pmid=16142213}}</ref><ref name="Bymaster 2005">{{cite journal|last=Bymaster|first=FP|author2=Lee, Knadler|title=The dual transporter inhibitor duloxetine: a review of its preclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic profile, and clinical results in depression|journal=Curr Pharm Des|year=2005|volume=11|issue=12|pmid=15892657|pages=1475–93|doi=10.2174/1381612053764805}}</ref>

Major depressive disorder is believed to be due in part to an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines within the central nervous system. Antidepressants including ones with a similar mechanism of action as duloxetine, i.e. serotonin metabolism inhibition, cause a decrease in proinflammatory [[cytokine]] activity and an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines; this mechanism may apply to duloxetine in its effect on depression but research on cytokines specific to duloxetine therapy is lacking.<ref name="pmid20646337">{{cite journal | author = De Berardis D, Conti CM, Serroni N, Moschetta FS, Olivieri L, Carano A, Salerno RM, Cavuto M, Farina B, Alessandrini M, Janiri L, Pozzi G, Di Giannantonio M | title = The effect of newer serotonin-noradrenalin antidepressants on cytokine production: a review of the current literature | journal = Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 417–22 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20646337 | doi =  | last2 = Conti | last3 = Serroni | last4 = Moschetta | last5 = Olivieri | last6 = Carano | last7 = Salerno | last8 = Cavuto | last9 = Farina | last10 = Alessandrini | last11 = Janiri | last12 = Pozzi | last13 = Di Giannantonio }}</ref>

===Pharmacokinetics===
'''Absorption''': Duloxetine is acid labile, and is formulated with enteric coating to prevent degradation in the stomach. Duloxetine has good oral bioavailability, averaging 50% after one 60&nbsp;mg dose. There is an average 2-hour lag until absorption begins with maximum plasma concentrations occurring about 6 hours post dose. Food does not affect the C<sub>max</sub> of duloxetine, but delays the time to reach peak concentration from 6 to 10 hours.<ref name="Bymaster 2005"/>

'''Distribution''': Duloxetine is highly bound (>90%) to proteins in human plasma, binding primarily to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein. Volume of distribution is 1640L.<ref name="Cymbalta product insert">{{cite web|title=Cymbalta product insert|url=http://pi.lilly.com/us/cymbalta-pi.pdf}}</ref>

'''Metabolism''': Duloxetine undergoes predominately hepatic metabolism via two cytochrome P450 isozymes, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2. Circulating metabolites are pharmacologically inactive.<ref name="Cymbalta product insert"/>

'''Elimination''': Duloxetine has an [[elimination half-life]] of about 12 hours (range 8 to 17 hours) and its pharmacokinetics are dose proportional over the [[Therapeutic index|therapeutic range]]. Steady-state is usually achieved after 3 days. Only trace amounts (<1%) of unchanged duloxetine are present in the urine and most of the dose (approx. 70%) appears in the urine as metabolites of duloxetine with about 20% excreted in the feces.<ref name="Cymbalta product insert"/>

==History==
[[Image:Cymbalta60mg.png|thumb|Cymbalta (duloxetine) 60mg]]
Duloxetine was created by Lilly researchers.  David Robertson; David Wong, a co-discoverer of [[fluoxetine]]; and Joseph Krushinski are listed as inventors on the [[patent application]] filed in 1986 and granted in 1990.<ref name="United States Patent: 4956388">{{cite web |url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=4956388.PN.&OS=PN/4956388&RS=PN/4956388|title=United States Patent 4,956,388:  3-Aryloxy-3-substituted propanamines |vauthors=Robertson DW, Wong DT, Krushinski JH |date=1990-09-11 |work= |publisher=USPTO |accessdate=2008-05-17}}</ref>  The first publication on the discovery of the [[racemic]] form of duloxetine known as LY227942, was made in 1988.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wong DT, Robertson DW, Bymaster FP, Krushinski JH, Reid LR |title=LY227942, an inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine uptake: biochemical pharmacology of a potential antidepressant drug |journal=Life Sci. |volume=43 |issue=24 |pages=2049–57 |year=1988 |pmid=2850421 |doi=10.1016/0024-3205(88)90579-6|last2=Robertson |last3=Bymaster |last4=Krushinski |last5=Reid }}</ref> The (+)-[[enantiomer]] of LY227942, assigned LY248686, was chosen for further studies, because it inhibited serotonin reuptake in rat synaptosomes to twice the degree of the (–)-enantiomer.

In 2001, Lilly filed a [[New Drug Application]] (NDA) for duloxetine with the US [[Food and Drug Administration]]. However, in 2003, the FDA "recommended this application as not approvable from the manufacturing and control standpoint" because of "significant cGMP (current [[Good Manufacturing Practice]]) violations at the finished product manufacturing facility" of Eli Lilly in Indianapolis. Additionally, "potential liver toxicity" and [[QT interval|QTc interval]] prolongation appeared as a concern. The FDA experts concluded that "duloxetine can cause hepatotoxicity in the form of transaminase elevations. It may also be a factor in causing more severe liver injury, but there are no cases in the NDA database that clearly demonstrate this. Use of duloxetine in the presence of ethanol may potentiate the deleterious effect of ethanol on the liver." The FDA also recommended "routine [[blood pressure]] monitoring" at the new highest recommended dose of 120&nbsp;mg, "where 24% patients had one or more blood pressure readings of 140/90 vs. 9% of placebo patients."<ref name="reg history">{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/nda/2004/021427_s000_Cymbalta_AdminCorres.pdf |title=Approval package for: application number NDA 721-427.

After the manufacturing issues were resolved, the [[Hepatotoxicity|liver toxicity]] warning included in the prescribing information, and the follow-up studies showed that duloxetine does not cause QTc interval prolongation, duloxetine was approved by the FDA for depression and diabetic neuropathy in 2004.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/news/2004/NEW01113.html FDA news]</ref> In 2007, [[Health Canada]] approved duloxetine for the treatment of depression and diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain.<ref>{{cite web|title=Summary Basis of Decision (SBD): Cymbalta|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/prodpharma/sbd-smd/drug-med/sbd_smd_2008_cymbalta_110028-eng.php|publisher=Health Canada|date=2008-05-05}}</ref>

Duloxetine was approved for use of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in the EU in 2004. In 2005, Lilly withdrew the duloxetine application for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in the U.S., stating that discussions with the FDA indicated "the agency is not prepared at this time to grant approval ... based on the data package submitted." A year later Lilly abandoned the pursuit of this indication in the U.S. market.<ref name=Yentreve>{{cite web |url=http://www.thestreet.com/_googlen/stocks/pharmaceuticals/10268662.html?cm_ven=GOOGLEN&cm_cat=FREE&cm_ite=NA |title=Lilly Won't Pursue Yentreve for U.S. |author=Steyer R |date=2006-02-15 |publisher=TheStreet.com |accessdate=2008-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202114300/http://www.thestreet.com/_googlen/stocks/pharmaceuticals/10268662.html?cm_ven=GOOGLEN&cm_cat=FREE&cm_ite=NA |archivedate=2009-02-02 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1136/bmj.331.7508.70-b | pmc = 558648 | pmid = 16002878 | title = FDA warns that antidepressants may increase suicidality in adults | year = 2005 | author = Lenzer J | journal = BMJ | volume = 331 | issue = 7508 | pages = 70}}</ref>
