The experience elicited by MDMA depends on the dose, setting, and user.<ref name=Betzler2017/> The variability of the induced altered state by MDMA is lower compared to other psychedelics. For example, MDMA used at parties is associated with high motor activity, reduced sense of self-identity as well as poor awareness of the background surroundings. Use of MDMA individually or in a small groups in a quiet environment and when concentrating, is associated with increased lucidity, capability of concentration, sensitivity of aesthetic aspects of the background and emotions, as well as greater capability of communication with others.<ref name="pmid22392347" /><ref name="Landriscina">{{cite journal|last1=Landriscina|first1=F.|title=MDMA and the states of Consciousness|journal=Eleusis|date=1995|volume=2|pages=3–9.}}</ref> In psychotherapeutic settings MDMA effects have been described by infantile ideas, alternating phases of mood, sometimes memories and moods connected with childhood experiences.<ref name="Landriscina" /><ref name="Baggott">{{cite journal|last1=Baggott|first1=M.

MDMA is often considered the drug of choice within the [[rave]] culture and is also used at clubs, festivals and [[house party|house parties]].<ref name="pmid22392347" /> In the rave environment, the sensory effects from the music and lighting are often highly [[Synergy|synergistic]] with the drug. The psychedelic [[amphetamine]] quality of MDMA offers multiple reasons for its appeal to users in the rave setting. Some users enjoy the feeling of mass communion from the inhibition-reducing effects of the drug, while others use it as party fuel because of the drug's stimulatory effects.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|title=Generation Ecstasy: Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415923735|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tGaRJiXe74UC&pg=PA81&dq=Generation+Ecstasy+MDMA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vh3NUe3SDOOJjALt8oGoDQ&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Generation%20Ecstasy%20MDMA&f=false}}</ref> MDMA is used less frequently than other stimulants, typically less than once per week.<ref name=Epstein2013/>

MDMA is sometimes taken in conjunction with other psychoactive drugs, such as [[LSD]], [[psilocybin mushroom]]s, and [[ketamine]]. Users sometimes use [[menthol]]ated products while taking MDMA for its cooling sensation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.drugabuse.gov/DirReports/DirRep500/DirectorReport5.html |title=Director's Report to the National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse |publisher=National Institute on Drug Abuse |date=May 2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203222445/http://archives.drugabuse.gov/DirReports/DirRep500/DirectorReport5.html |archivedate=3 February 2016 }}</ref>

===Forms===

MDMA has become widely known as ecstasy (shortened "E", "X", or "XTC"), usually referring to its tablet form, although this term may also include the presence of possible [[adulterant]]s or dilutants. The UK term "mandy" and the US term "molly" colloquially refer to MDMA in a crystalline powder form that is thought to be free of adulterants.<ref name="nature.com"/><ref name=DrugFacts/><ref name="DEA 2015 assessment" /> MDMA is also sold in the form of the hydrochloride salt, either as loose crystals or in [[Capsule (pharmacy)|gelcaps]].<ref name="Molly S05E07" /><ref name="Molly S06E05" />

In part due to the global supply shortage of [[sassafras oil]], substances that are sold as molly frequently contain no MDMA and instead contain [[methylone]], [[ethylone]], [[MDPV]], [[mephedrone]], or any other of the group of compounds commonly known as [[Bath salts (drug)|bath salts]].<ref name=DrugFacts /><ref name="DEA 2015 assessment" /><ref name="Molly S05E07">{{cite AV media |date=13 August 2014 |title=Molly Madness |medium=TV documentary |url= <!--Link for WP:V - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-0Zw05A1Y0 -->|publisher=National Geographic Channel | work = [[Drugs, Inc.]] |asin=B00LIC368M }}</ref><ref name="Molly S06E05">{{cite AV media |date=10 December 2014 |title=Manic Molly |medium=TV documentary |url= <!--Link for WP:V - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pd1-triBJFw -->|publisher=National Geographic Channel | work = [[Drugs, Inc.]] |asin=B00LIC368M }}</ref> Powdered MDMA ranges from pure MDMA to crushed tablets with 30–40% purity.<ref name="EMCDDA" /> MDMA tablets typically have low purity due to bulking agents that are added to dilute the drug and increase profits (e.g., lactose) and binding agents.<ref name="EMCDDA" /> Tablets sold as ecstasy sometimes contain [[3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine]] (MDA), [[3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine]] (MDEA), other amphetamine derivatives, caffeine, opiates, or painkillers.<ref name=Betzler2017/> Some tablets contain little or no MDMA.<ref name=Betzler2017/><ref name="EMCDDA" /><ref name="Toxnet MDMA" /> The proportion of seized ecstasy tablets with MDMA-like impurities has varied annually and by country.<ref name="EMCDDA" /> The average content of MDMA in a preparation is 70 to 120&nbsp;mg with the purity having increased since the 1990s.<ref name=Betzler2017/>

MDMA is usually consumed by mouth. It is also sometimes [[insufflation (medicine)|snorted]].<ref name=Drugs2014>{{cite web|title=MDMA|url=http://www.drugs.com/illicit/mdma.html|accessdate=30 March 2016|editor-last=Anderson|editor-first=Leigh|website=Drugs.com|publisher=Drugsite Trust|date=18 May 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323161153/http://www.drugs.com/illicit/mdma.html|archivedate=23 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Long-term===
{{As of|2015}}, the long-term effects of MDMA on human brain structure and function have not been fully determined.<ref name="Abstinent MDMA fMRI review">{{cite journal | vauthors = Garg A, Kapoor S, Goel M, Chopra S, Chopra M, Kapoor A, McCann UD, Behera C | title = Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Abstinent MDMA Users: A Review | journal = Curr.

Chemical Neuroimaging, assaying the levels of myoinositol (MI) and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in the brains of MDMA users using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), has not revealed any consistent results [17, 26-29]. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown task evoked differences in regional brain activation, measured as blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal intensity and/or spatial extent of activation, in MDMA users and controls [30-33].&nbsp;... Neurocognitive studies, in MDMA users, have consistently revealed dose related memory and learning problems [35-38]&nbsp;... Serotonergic innervation is known to regulate the cerebral microvasculature. Chronic MDMA use results in serotonin toxicity, therefore MDMA users are expected to have altered regional blood flow detectable in fMRI [17].&nbsp;... Animal data has suggested that MDMA is selectively more toxic to the axons more distal to the brainstem cell bodies, that is, those present mainly in the occipital cortex [54, 55]. Also, human PET and SPECT studies have revealed significant reductions in serotonin transporter binding, most evident in the occipital cortex [18, 20]&nbsp;... The effects of poly-drug exposure may result in additive neurotoxicity or mutual neuro-protection. MDMA is known to induce hyperthermia which is a prooxidant neurotoxic condition [65]. Hyperthermia is known to accentuate the neurotoxic potential of MDMA as well as methamphetamine [66, 67]. On the other hand, lowering of the core body temperature has been shown to have a neuroprotective effect.}}</ref> However, there is consistent evidence of structural and functional deficits in MDMA users with a high lifetime exposure.<ref name="Abstinent MDMA fMRI review" /><ref name="mueller2015"/> In contrast, there is no evidence of structural or functional changes in MDMA users with only a moderate (<50 doses used and <100 tablets consumed) lifetime exposure.<ref name="mueller2015">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mueller F, Lenz C, Steiner M, Dolder PC, Walter M, Lang UE, Liechti ME, Borgwardt S | title = Neuroimaging in moderate MDMA use: A systematic review | journal = Neurosci.

[…] We did not find any studies directly investigating the quality of life of participants, and we found no attempts to assess the clinical meaningfulness of any inter-cohort differences. The clinical significance of any exposure effect is thus uncertain; it seems unlikely that these deficits significantly impair the average ecstasy user’s everyday functioning or quality of life.

===Reinforcement disorders===
<!--Dependence-->
Approximately 60% of MDMA users experience [[drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms when they stop taking MDMA.<ref name="Toxnet MDMA" /> Some of these symptoms include fatigue, loss of appetite, depression, and trouble concentrating.<ref name="Toxnet MDMA"/> [[Drug tolerance|Tolerance]] to some of the desired<!-- (e.g., euphoria) - need ref--> and adverse<!-- (e.g., loss of appetite) - need ref--> effects of MDMA is expected to occur with consistent MDMA use.<ref name="Toxnet MDMA" /> A 2007 analysis estimated MDMA to have a psychological dependence and physical dependence potential roughly three fourths and four fifths that of cannabis.<ref name="pmid17382831"/>

<!--Addiction-->
MDMA has been shown to induce [[ΔFosB]] in the [[nucleus accumbens]].<ref name="MDMA ΔFosB">{{cite journal |vauthors=Olausson P, Jentsch JD, Tronson N, Neve RL, Nestler EJ, Taylor JR | title = DeltaFosB in the nucleus accumbens regulates food-reinforced instrumental behavior and motivation | journal = J.

This indicates that ΔFosB is both necessary and sufficient for many of the changes wrought in the brain by chronic drug exposure. ΔFosB is also induced in D1-type NAc MSNs by chronic consumption of several natural rewards, including sucrose, high fat food, sex, wheel running, where it promotes that consumption<sup>14,26–30</sup>.

===Harm assessment===
A 2007 UK study ranked MDMA 18th in harmfulness out of 20 recreational drugs. Rankings for each drug were based on the risk for acute physical harm, the propensity for physical and psychological dependency on the drug, and the negative familial and societal impacts of the drug. The authors did not evaluate or rate the negative impact of ecstasy on the cognitive health of ecstasy users (e.g. impaired memory and concentration).<ref name="pmid17382831">{{Cite journal| journal = The Lancet | first4 = C.| last4 = Blakemore| authorlink4 = Colin Blakemore| authorlink1 = David Nutt| volume = 369| issue = 9566| pmid=17382831| pages = 1047–1053 | first3 = W.| last3 = Saulsbury| year = 2007| title = Development of a rational scale to assess the harm of drugs of potential misuse| last1 = Nutt | first1 = D. | first2 = L.

==Overdose==
MDMA overdose symptoms vary widely due to the involvement of multiple organ systems. Some of the more overt overdose symptoms are listed in the table below. The number of instances of fatal MDMA intoxication is low relative to its usage rates. In most fatalities MDMA was not the only drug involved. Acute toxicity is mainly caused by [[serotonin syndrome]] and [[sympathomimetic]] effects.<ref name=Steinkellner2011/>  MDMA's toxicity in overdose may be exacerbated by caffeine, with which it is frequently cut (mixed with to increase volume).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Vanattou-Saïfoudine|first1=N|last2=McNamara|first2=R|last3=Harkin|first3=A|title=Caffeine provokes adverse interactions with 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ‘ecstasy’) and related psychostimulants: mechanisms and mediators|journal=British Journal of Pharmacology|date=13 January 2017|volume=167|issue=5|pages=946–959|doi=10.1111/j.1476-5381.2012.02065.x|issn=0007-1188|pmid=22671762|pmc=3492978}}</ref> A scheme for management of acute MDMA toxicity has been published focusing on treatment of hyperthermia, hyponatraemia, seratonin syndrome, and multiple organ failure.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=A.

===Detection in body fluids===
MDMA and MDA may be quantitated in blood, plasma or urine to monitor for use, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning or assist in the forensic investigation of a traffic or other criminal violation or a sudden death. Some drug abuse screening programs rely on hair, saliva, or sweat as specimens. Most commercial amphetamine immunoassay screening tests cross-react significantly with MDMA or its major metabolites, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish and separately measure each of these substances. The concentrations of MDA in the blood or urine of a person who has taken only MDMA are, in general, less than 10% those of the parent drug.<ref>Kolbrich EA, Goodwin RS, Gorelick DA, Hayes RJ, Stein EA, Huestis MA.

MDMA was first synthesized in 1912 by [[Merck KGaA|Merck]] chemist [[Anton Köllisch]]. At the time, Merck was interested in developing substances that stopped abnormal bleeding. Merck wanted to avoid an existing patent held by [[Bayer]] for one such compound: [[hydrastinine]]. Köllisch developed a preparation of a hydrastinine [[chemical analogue|analogue]], methylhydrastinine, at the request of fellow lab members, Walther Beckh and Otto Wolfes. MDMA (called methylsafrylamin, safrylmethylamin or N-Methyl-a-Methylhomopiperonylamin in Merck laboratory reports) was an [[reaction intermediate|intermediate compound]] in the synthesis of methylhydrastinine. Merck was not interested in MDMA itself at the time.<ref name="pmid17152992">{{cite journal |vauthors=Bernschneider-Reif S, Oxler F, Freudenmann RW | title = The origin of MDMA ('Ecstasy') – separating the facts from the myth | journal = Pharmazie | volume = 61 | issue = 11 | pages = 966–972 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17152992 | doi = 10.5555/phmz.61.11.966 | url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/govi/pharmaz/2006/00000061/00000011/art00015}}</ref> On 24 December 1912, Merck filed two patent applications that described the synthesis and some chemical properties of MDMA<ref name="DE274350">{{cite web|url = http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=DE&NR=274350C&FT=D|title = German Patent 274350: Verfahren zur Darstellung von Alkyloxyaryl-, Dialkyloxyaryl- und Alkylendioxyarylaminopropanen bzw. deren am Stickstoff monoalkylierten Derivaten.|author = Firma E.

Merck records indicate its researchers returned to the compound sporadically. A 1920 Merck patent describes a chemical modification to MDMA.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shulgin|first1=Alexander T.|editor1-last=Peroutka|editor1-first=Stephen J.|title=Ecstasy : the clinical, pharmacological, and neurotoxicological effects of the drug MDMA|date=1990|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Boston|isbn=0792303059|pages=2, 14|chapter=1. History of MDMA}}</ref> In 1927, Max Oberlin studied the pharmacology of MDMA while searching for substances with effects similar to [[adrenaline]] or [[ephedrine]], the latter being structurally similar to MDMA. Compared to ephedrine, Oberlin observed that it had similar effects on [[vascular smooth muscle]] tissue, stronger effects at the uterus, and no "local effect at the eye". MDMA was also found to have effects on [[blood sugar]] levels comparable to high doses of ephedrine. Oberlin concluded that the effects of MDMA were not limited to the [[sympathetic nervous system]]. Research was stopped "particularly due to a strong price increase of safrylmethylamine", which was still used as an intermediate in methylhydrastinine synthesis. Albert van Schoor performed simple toxicological tests with the drug in 1952, most likely while researching new stimulants or circulatory medications. After pharmacological studies, research on MDMA was not continued. In 1959, Wolfgang Fruhstorfer synthesized MDMA for pharmacological testing while researching stimulants. It is unclear if Fruhstorfer investigated the effects of MDMA in humans.<ref name="pmid17152992"/>

Outside of Merck, other researchers began to investigate MDMA.

===Shulgin's research and early use in therapy ===
[[File:Shulgin sasha 2011 hanna jon.jpg|thumb|Alexander and Ann Shulgin in December 2011]]

American chemist and [[psychopharmacologist]] [[Alexander Shulgin]] reported he synthesized MDMA in 1965 while researching methylenedioxy compounds at [[Dow Chemical Company]], but did not test the psychoactivity of the compound at this time. Around 1970, Shulgin sent instructions for N-methylated MDA (MDMA) synthesis to the founder of a Los Angeles chemical company who had requested them. This individual later provided these instructions to a client in the Midwest. Shulgin may have suspected he played a role in the emergence of MDMA in Chicago.<ref name="Shulgin">{{cite journal|last1=Benzenhöfer|first1=Udo|last2=Passie|first2=Torsten|title=Rediscovering MDMA (ecstasy): the role of the American chemist Alexander T.

Shulgin first heard of the psychoactive effects of N-methylated MDA around 1975 from a young student who reported "amphetamine-like content".<ref name="Shulgin"/> Around 30 May 1976, Shulgin again heard about the effects of N-methylated MDA,<ref name="Shulgin"/> this time from a graduate student in a medicinal chemistry group he advised at [[San Francisco State University]]<ref name="Professor X"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Alexander ‘Sasha’ Shulgin|url=http://www.shulginresearch.org/home/about/alexander-sasha-shulgin/|publisher=Alexander Shulgin Research Institute|accessdate=8 January 2015}}</ref> who directed him to the University of Michigan study.<ref name=PiHKAL/> She and two close friends had consumed 100&nbsp;mg of MDMA and reported positive emotional experiences.<ref name=Shulgin/> Following the self-trials of a colleague at the [[University of San Francisco]], Shulgin synthesized MDMA and tried it himself in September and October 1976.<ref name="Shulgin"/><ref name="Professor X"/> Shulgin first reported on MDMA in a presentation at a conference in Bethesda, Maryland in December 1976.<ref name="Shulgin"/> In 1978, he and [[David E. Nichols]] published a report on the drug's psychoactive effect in humans. They described MDMA as inducing "an easily controlled altered state of consciousness with emotional and sensual overtones" comparable "to marijuana, to [[psilocybin]] devoid of the hallucinatory component, or to low levels of MDA".<ref name="isbn0-08-021938-1">{{cite book|vauthors=Shulgin AT, Nichols DE |editor1=Willette, Robert E. |editor2=Stillman, Richard Joseph |title = The Psychopharmacology of Hallucinogens.|publisher = Pergamon Press|location = New York|year = 1978|pages = 74–83|chapter = Characterization of Three New Psychotomimetics|isbn = 0-08-021938-1|url = http://www.erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?A=ShowDocPartFrame&ID=961&DocPartID=832}}</ref>

When he tried the drug in 1977, Zeff was impressed with the effects of MDMA and came out of his semi-retirement to promote its use in therapy. Over the following years, Zeff traveled around the US and occasionally to Europe, eventually training an estimated four thousand psychotherapists in the therapeutic use of MDMA.<ref name="Dr. Ecstasy">{{cite news|first = Drake|last = Bennett|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/30/magazine/30ECSTASY.html|title = Dr. Ecstasy.|work = New York Times Magazine |date = 30 January 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Shulgin|first1=Ann|author1-link=Ann Shulgin|editor1-last=Doblin|editor1-first=Rick|editor1-link=Rick Doblin|title=The Secret Chief Revealed|date=2004|publisher=Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies|location=Sarasota, Fl|isbn=0-9660019-6-6|pages=17–18|edition=2nd|url=http://maps.org/images/pdf/books/scr/scr.pdf|accessdate=7 January 2015|chapter=Tribute to Jacob}}</ref> Zeff named the drug "'''Adam'''", believing it put users in a state of primordial innocence.<ref name="Professor X">{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Ethan|title=Professor X|url=http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/10.09/professorx.html?pg=3&topic=&topic_set=|publisher=Wired|accessdate=4 January 2015|date=September 2002}}</ref>

Psychotherapists who used MDMA believed the drug eliminated the typical fear response and increased communication. Sessions were usually held in the home of the patient or the therapist. The role therapist was minimized in favor of patient self-discovery accompanied by MDMA induced feelings of empathy. Depression, substance abuse, relationship problems, premenstrual syndrome, and autism were among several psychiatric disorders MDMA assisted therapy was reported to treat.<ref name=exploration/> According to psychiatrist George Greer, therapists who used MDMA in their practice were impressed by the results. Anecdotally, MDMA was said to greatly accelerate therapy.<ref name="Dr. Ecstasy"/>

===Rising recreational use===

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, "Adam" spread through personal networks of psychotherapists, psychiatrists, users of psychedelics, and [[yuppies]].

===Media attention and scheduling===

====United States====
[[File:Federal Register notice of planned MDMA scheduling.pdf|thumb|27 July 1984 Federal Register notice of the proposed MDMA scheduling]]

In an early media report on MDMA published in 1982, a [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) spokesman stated the agency would ban the drug if enough evidence for abuse could be found.<ref name="Beck & Rosenbaum"/> By mid-1984, MDMA use was becoming more noticed. Bill Mandel reported on "Adam" in a 10 June [[San Francisco Chronicle]] article, but misidentified the drug as [[MMDA (drug)|methyloxymethylenedioxyamphetamine]] (MMDA). In the next month, the World Health Organization identified MDMA as the only substance out of twenty phenethylamines to be seized a significant number of times.<ref name="Eisner" />

After a year of planning and data collection, MDMA was proposed for [[Controlled Substances Act|scheduling]] by the DEA on 27 July 1984 with a request for comments and objections.<ref name=Eisner/><ref>{{cite journal|title=Schedules of Controlled Substances Proposed Placement of 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine in Schedule I|journal=Federal Register|date=27 July 1984|volume=49|issue=146|page=30210|url=http://maps.org/research-archive/dea-mdma/pdf/0194.PDF|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref> The DEA was surprised when a number of psychiatrists, psychotherapists, and researchers objected to the proposed scheduling and requested a hearing.<ref name="exploration"/> In a [[Newsweek]] article published the next year, a DEA pharmacologist stated that the agency had been unaware of its use among psychiatrists.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Adler|first1=Jerry|last2=Abramson|first2=Pamela|last3=Katz|first3=Susan|last4=Hager|first4=Mary|title=Getting High on 'Ecstasy'|url=http://www.maps.org/research-archive/hmma/Newsweek4.85.pdf|accessdate=1 February 2015|work=Newsweek|publisher=Newsweek Magazine|date=15 April 1985|location=Life/Style|page=96}}</ref> An initial hearing was held on 1 February 1985 at the DEA offices in Washington, D.C. with administrative law judge Francis L.

As a result of several expert witnesses testifying that MDMA had an accepted medical usage, the administrative law judge presiding over the hearings recommended that MDMA be classified as a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule III controlled substances|Schedule III]] substance.

Despite this, less than a month later Lawn reviewed the evidence and reclassified MDMA as Schedule I again, claiming that the expert testimony of several psychiatrists claiming over 200 cases where MDMA had been used in a therapeutic context with positive results could be dismissed because they weren't published in medical journals.<ref name=exploration/>{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} No double blind studies had yet been conducted as to the efficacy of MDMA for therapy.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

====United Nations====
While engaged in scheduling debates in the United States, the DEA also pushed for international scheduling.<ref name=comprehensive/> In 1985 the [[World Health Organization]]'s Expert Committee on Drug Dependence recommended that MDMA be placed in Schedule I of the 1971 United Nations [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]]. The committee made this recommendation on the basis of the pharmacological similarity of MDMA to previously scheduled drugs, reports of illicit trafficking in Canada, drug seizures in the United States, and lack of well-defined therapeutic use. While intrigued by reports of psychotherapeutic uses for the drug, the committee viewed the studies as lacking appropriate methodological design and encouraged further research. Committee chairman [[Paul Grof]] dissented, believing  international control was not warranted at the time and a recommendation should await further therapeutic data.<ref>{{cite book|title=WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence: Twenty-second Report.|date=1985|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=9241207299|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_729.pdf|accessdate=29 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019192225/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_729.pdf|format=PDF|archivedate= 19 October 2014|pages=24–25}}</ref> The [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]] added MDMA to Schedule I of the convention on 11 February 1986.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/commissions/CND/Drug_Resolutions/1980-1989/1986/CND_Decision-1986-07_S-IX.pdf |title=Decision to place MDMA into Schedule I |publisher=Commission on Narcotic Drugs |date=11 February 1986 |website=UNODC |access-date=9 May 2015}}</ref>

In 2010, the BBC reported that use of MDMA had decreased in the UK in previous years.

===Legal status===
MDMA is legally controlled in most of the world under the UN [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]] and other international agreements, although exceptions exist for research and limited medical use. In general, the unlicensed use, sale or manufacture of MDMA are all criminal offences.

====Australia====
In Australia, MDMA was declared an illegal substance in 1986 because of its harmful effects and potential for abuse. It is classed as a [[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons|Schedule 9 Prohibited Substance]] in the country, meaning it is available for scientific research purposes only. Any other type of sale, use or manufacture is strictly prohibited by law. Permits for research uses on humans must be approved by a recognized [[National Health and Medical Research Council|ethics committee]] on human research.

In [[Western Australia]] under the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1981]] 4.0g of MDMA is the amount required determining a court of trial, 2.0g is considered a presumption with intent to sell or supply and 28.0g is considered trafficking under Australian law.<ref>{{cite web|title=Misuse of Drugs Act 1981|url=https://www.slp.wa.gov.au/legislation/statutes.nsf/main_mrtitle_4607_homepage.html|publisher=The Government of Western Australia|agency=Department of the Premier and Cabinet|date=23 October 1981}}</ref>

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, MDMA was made illegal in 1977 by a modification order to the existing [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]]. Although MDMA was not named explicitly in this legislation, the order extended the definition of Class A drugs to include various ring-substituted phenethylamines.<ref name="Drugs 2.0">{{cite book|last1=Power|first1=Mike|title=Drugs 2.0 : the web revolution that's changing how the world gets high|date=2013|publisher=Portobello|location=London|isbn=9781846274596|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gj6zMQEACAAJ&dq=Drugs+2.0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=fm1WVb2DFoavsAXPm4CoBg&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA|format=epub file}}</ref><ref name="UK legality">[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Primary&PageNumber=57&NavFrom=2&parentActiveTextDocId=1367412&ActiveTextDocId=1367472&filesize=411 Misuse of Drugs Act 1971].

Penalties include a maximum of seven years and/or unlimited fine for possession; life and/or unlimited fine for production or trafficking.

Some researchers such as [[David Nutt]] have criticized the current scheduling of MDMA, what he determined to be a relatively harmless drug.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Ecstasy 'no more dangerous than horse riding'|url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/4537874/Ecstasy-no-more-dangerous-than-horse-riding.html|website = Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate = 4 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nutt|first1=D.|title=Equasy – An overlooked addiction with implications for the current debate on drug harms|journal=Journal of Psychopharmacology|date=21 January 2009|volume=23|issue=1|pages=3–5|doi=10.1177/0269881108099672|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0269881108099672?ssource=mfr&rss=1|language=en|pmid=19158127}}</ref>  An editorial he wrote in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, where he compared the risk of harm for horse riding (1 adverse event in 350) to that of ecstasy (1 in 10,000) resulted in his dismissal as well as the resignation of his colleagues from the ACMD.<ref name="johnson">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/nov/02/drug-policy-alan-johnson-nutt|title=Why Professor David Nutt was shown the door|last=Johnson|first=Alan|date=2 November 2009|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=3 November 2009 | location=London}}</ref>

In the United States, MDMA is currently placed in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act.<ref>''Schedules of Controlled Substances; Scheduling of 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) Into Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act; Remand'', 53 Fed.

====Netherlands====
In the Netherlands, the Expert Committee on the List (Expertcommissie Lijstensystematiek Opiumwet) issued a report in June 2011 which discussed the evidence for harm and the legal status of MDMA, arguing in favor of maintaining it on List I.<ref name="papers.ssrn.com"/><ref>[http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten-en-publicaties/rapporten/2011/06/27/rapport-drugs-in-lijsten.html Rapport Drugs in Lijsten | Rapport].

This argues in favour of maintaining MDMA on List I.}}</ref>

====Canada====
In Canada, MDMA is listed as a [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act#Schedule I|Schedule 1]]<ref name="CDSA Schedule I: Amphetamines">{{cite web|title=Schedule I|url=http://isomerdesign.com/Cdsa/schedule.php?schedule=1&section=18.5&structure=C|work=Controlled Drugs and Substances Act|publisher=Isomer Design|accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref> as it is an analogue of amphetamine.<ref name="Definitions and Interpretations">{{cite web|title=Definitions and interpretations|url=http://isomerdesign.com/Cdsa/definitions.php?structure=C|work=Controlled Drugs and Substances Act|publisher=Isomer Design|accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref> The CDSA was updated as a result of the Safe Streets Act changing amphetamines from [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act#Schedule III|Schedule III]] to Schedule I in March 2012.

MDMA is particularly expensive in Australia, costing [[Australian dollar|A$]]15–A$30 per tablet. In terms of purity data for Australian MDMA, the average is around 34%, ranging from less than 1% to about 85%. The majority of tablets contain 70–85&nbsp;mg of MDMA.
