'''DiPT''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɪ|p|t|iː}} or '''''N,N''-diisopropyltryptamine''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|aɪ|ˌ|aɪ|s|oʊ-|ˌ|p|r|oʊ|p|ᵻ|l|ˈ|t|r|ɪ|p|t|əm|iː|n}} is a [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic drug]] of the [[tryptamine]] family that has a unique effect. While the majority of hallucinogens affect the visual sense, DiPT is primarily aural. It has been suggested that DiPT may have value to researchers of [[neurology]] due to its complex audio distorting effects.

==Chemistry==
DiPT is a derivative of tryptamine formed by substituting isopropyl groups for the two hydrogen atoms attached to the non-aromatic nitrogen atom in the tryptamine molecule.

==Hallucinogenic properties==
===General effects===
Although DiPT's effects are primarily aural, some users have reported that at higher doses they noticed a lack of coordination or balance, confusion, and some users have reported minor visual distortions. Aside from these, the most prevalent non-auditory effect is inner ear pressure (which has been painful in some instances, for example when combined with MDMA).  Unlike other psychedelics, users' [[set and setting]] doesn't seem to influence what is experienced. {{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Audio distortion===
There is much speculation as to the nature of DiPT's aural distortion. At lower dosages, it has been reported to have an effect similar to a [[flanging]], or a [[Phase (waves)|phase shift]]. At medium and higher dosages, the effect of DiPT is typically a radical shift downward in perceived [[Pitch (music)|pitch]]. This shift tends to be [[nonlinear]], in that the shift downwards varies in relation to the initial pitch. This can produce bizarre sounds and render music disharmonious. <ref>{{cite book|last=shulgin|first=alexander|title=TiHKAL: Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved|date=1997|publisher=Transform Press|location=Berkeley, CA USA|isbn=0-9630096-9-9|pages=403–406|url=https://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal04.shtml}}</ref> 

There has been an experiment involving subjects with [[absolute pitch|perfect pitch]], the goal of which was to determine whether the pitch difference is truly distortive or linear, the results of which indicated that there is no clear relationship between perceived pitch and actual pitch. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} DiPT still remains widely unexplored.

==Legal status==
===United Kingdom===
As is the case with many [[PiHKAL]] and [[TiHKAL]] drugs, it is Class A in the UK, making it illegal to possess or use.

===United States===
DiPT is not scheduled at the federal level in the [[United States]],<ref name="PART 1308 — SCHEDULES OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES - 1308.11 Schedule I">[http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1308/1308_11.htm 21 CFR — SCHEDULES OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES §1308.11 Schedule I.]</ref> but it could be considered an analog of [[5-MeO-DiPT]], in which case purchase, sale, or possession could be prosecuted under the [[Federal Analog Act]]. Some of the people arrested in [[Operation Web Tryp]] were selling DiPT.

====Florida====
"DiPT (N,N-Diisopropyltryptamine)" is a Schedule I [[controlled substance]] in the state of [[Florida]] making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess in Florida.<ref name="Florida Statutes - Chapter 893 - DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION AND CONTROL">[http://leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0800-0899/0893/0893.html Florida Statutes - Chapter 893 - DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION AND CONTROL]</ref>
