==Medical uses==
Praziquantel is used to treat diseases caused by infection with several types of internal/gastrointestinal, and external parasites, including:
* [[Echinococcosis|Hydatid disease]] caused by infection of various organs with larval stages of tapeworms of the genus ''[[Echinococcus]]''.
* [[Cysticercosis]] caused by infection of the brain and/or muscles with the eggs and larvae of the pork tapeworm ''[[Taenia solium]]'' (though it has been judged less effective than [[albendazole]] in treatment of [[neurocysticercosis]]).<ref name="pmid18335068">{{cite journal |author=Matthaiou DK, Panos G, Adamidi ES, Falagas ME |title=Albendazole versus Praziquantel in the Treatment of Neurocysticercosis: A Meta-analysis of Comparative Trials |journal=PLoS Negl Trop Dis |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=e194 |year=2008 |pmid=18335068 |pmc=2265431 |doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000194 |url=http://www.plosntds.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pntd.0000194 |editor1-last=Carabin |editor1-first=Hélène |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202135741/http://www.plosntds.org/article/info%3Adoi/10.1371/journal.pntd.0000194 |archivedate=2009-02-02 |df= }}</ref>

==Side effects==
The majority of side effects develop due to the release of the contents of the parasites as they are killed and the consequent host immune reaction. The heavier the parasite burden, the heavier and more frequent the side effects normally are.
* Central nervous system: Frequently occurring side effects are [[dizziness]], [[headache]], and malaise. [[Drowsiness]], [[somnolence]], [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], and [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]] have also been seen. Almost all patients with cerebral [[cysticercosis]] experience CNS side effects related to the cell-death of the parasites (headache, worsening of pre-existing neurological problems, [[seizures]], [[arachnoiditis]], and [[meningism]]). These side effects may be life-threatening and can be reduced by coadministration of [[corticosteroid]]s. It is strongly recommended that all patients with cerebral [[cysticercosis]] are hospitalized during treatment.
* Gastrointestinal tract: Approximately 90% of all patients have abdominal pain or cramps with or without nausea and vomiting. [[Diarrhea]] may develop and may be severe with colic. Sweating, fever, and sometimes bloody stools may occur together with diarrhea.
* Liver: Asymptomatic and transient increases of liver enzymes ([[Aspartate transaminase|AST]] and [[Alanine transaminase|ALT]]) are noted frequently (up to 27%). No case of symptomatic liver damage has ever been seen so far.
* Sensitivity reactions: [[Urticaria]], [[rash]], [[pruritus]] and [[eosinophilia]] in white blood cell counts
* Other locations/body as a whole: Lower back pain, myalgia, arthralgia, fever, sweating, various cardiac [[arrhythmias]], and [[hypotension]]

===Pregnancy===
Animal studies have failed to reveal evidence of fetal harm. There are no controlled data in human pregnancy. Praziquantel should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed; caution is recommended.

==Drug interactions==
The antibiotic [[rifampicin]] decreases plasma concentrations of praziquantel.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ridtitid W, Wongnawa M, Mahatthanatrakul W, Punyo J, Sunbhanich M |title=Rifampin markedly decreases plasma concentrations of praziquantel in healthy volunteers |journal=Clin.

[[Carbamazepine]] and [[phenytoin]] are reported to reduce the bioavailability of praziquantel.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Quinn DI, Day RO |title=Drug interactions of clinical importance.

The drug [[cimetidine]] heightens praziquantel bioavailability.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Metwally A, Bennett JL, Botros S, Ebeid F |title=Effect of cimetidine, bicarbonate and glucose on the bioavailability of different formulations of praziquantel |journal=Arzneimittelforschung |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=516–8 |date=April 1995 |pmid=7779153 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Jung H, Medina R, Castro N, Corona T, Sotelo J |title=Pharmacokinetic study of praziquantel administered alone and in combination with cimetidine in a single-day therapeutic regimen |journal=Antimicrob.

==Mechanism of action==
The mode of action is not exactly known at present, but experimental evidence indicates praziquantel increases the permeability of the membranes of [[schistosome]] cells towards calcium ions. The drug thereby induces contraction of the parasites, resulting in paralysis in the contracted state. The dying parasites are dislodged from their site of action in the host organism and may enter systemic circulation or may be destroyed by host immune reaction ([[phagocytosis]]). Additional mechanisms including focal disintegrations and disturbances of oviposition (laying of eggs) are seen in other types of sensitive parasites.

Another hypothesis concerning the mechanism of action of praziquantel has been recently{{when|date=November 2015}} reported. The drug seems to interfere with [[adenosine]] uptake in cultured worms. This effect may have therapeutical relevance given that the schistosome, as the [[Taenia (genus)|''Taenia'']] and the ''[[Echinococcus]]'' (other praziquantel-sensitive parasites), is unable to synthesize [[purine]]s such as adenosine ''de novo''.

Bayer's Animal Health Division website states, "Praziquantel is active against cestodes (tapeworms). Praziquantel is absorbed, metabolized in the liver, and excreted in the bile. Upon entering the digestive tract from the bile, cestocidal activity is exhibited. Following exposure to praziquantel, the tapeworm loses its ability to resist digestion by the mammalian host. Because of this, whole tapeworms, including the [[cestoda|scolices]] (plural of "scolex"), are very rarely passed after administration of praziquantel. In many instances, only disintegrated and partially digested pieces of tapeworms will be seen in the stool. The majority of tapeworms are digested and are not found in the feces."<ref>http://bayer.naccvp.com/view_label.php{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}</ref>

Praziquantel is administered as a [[Racemic mixture|racemate]], but only the (''R'')-[[enantiomer]] is biologically active; the enantiomers may be separated using a resolution of an [[amine]] obtained from praziquantel.<ref name="Todd PZQ">{{Cite journal | last1 = Woelfle | first1 = M. | last2 = Seerden | first2 = J.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Praziquantel is well absorbed (about 80%) from the [[gastrointestinal tract]]. However, due to extensive [[First pass effect|first-pass metabolism]], only a relatively small amount enters systemic circulation. Praziquantel has a [[Blood serum|serum]] [[half-life]] of 0.8 to 1.5 hours in adults with normal renal and liver function. [[Metabolite]]s have a half-life of 4 to 5 hours. In patients with significantly impaired liver function ([[Child-Pugh score]] B and C), the serum half-life is increased to 3 to 8 hours. Praziquantel and its metabolites are mainly excreted renally; within 24 h after a single oral dose, 70 to 80% is found in urine, but less than 0.1% as the unchanged drug. Praziquantel is metabolized through the [[cytochrome P450]] pathway via [[CYP3A4]].  Agents that [[Enzyme induction and inhibition|induce or inhibit]] CYP3A4 such as [[phenytoin]], [[rifampin]], and [[Azole antifungals#Imidazole and triazole antifungals|azole]] antifungals will affect the metabolism of praziquantel.

Praziquantel has a particularly dramatic effect on patients with [[schistosomiasis]]. Studies of those treated have shown that within six months of receiving a dose of praziquantel, up to 90% of the damage done to internal organs due to schistosomiasis infection can be reversed.<ref name="SCP"/>

==History==
Praziquantel was developed in the laboratories for parasitological research of [[Bayer AG]] and [[Merck KGaA]] in Germany (Elberfeld and Darmstadt) in the mid 1970s.
