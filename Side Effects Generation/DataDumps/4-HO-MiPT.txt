'''4-HO-MiPT''' ('''miprocin''', '''4-hydroxy-''N''-methyl-''N''-isopropyltryptamine''') is a [[Organic compound#Synthetic compounds|synthetic]] [[Substitution reaction#Substituted compounds|substituted]] [[aromatic]] [[Chemical compound|compound]] and a lesser-known [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] [[tryptamine]]. It is thought to be a [[serotonergic psychedelic]], similar to [[magic mushrooms]], [[LSD]] and [[mescaline]].{{cn|date=November 2013}} Its molecular structure and pharmacological effects somewhat resemble those of the tryptamine [[psilocin]], which is the primary psychoactive chemical in [[magic mushrooms]].

==History==
4-HO-MiPT was presumably first [[Chemical synthesis|synthesized]] by [[Alexander Shulgin]]. Its synthesis is described in his book ''[[TiHKAL]]'' along with reports by people who had ingested the compound. Shulgin's trials and other anecdotal information suggest that 4-HO-MiPT is a synthetic psychedelic similar in activity to psilocin. It is relatively uncommon and has only a short history of human use.

==Chemistry==
Miprocin is the 4-[[hydroxyl]] [[analog (chemistry)|analog]] of the chemical [[N-Methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine|''N''-methyl-''N''-isopropyltryptamine]] as well as the isopropyl [[Homology (chemistry)|homolog]] and possible [[structural analog]] of [[4-HO-DMT]].

==Pharmacology==
4-HO-MiPT is thought to be a [[serotonergic]] [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]].{{cn|date=November 2013}} Like other serotonergic psychedelics, its method of action is believed to result from its [[partial agonism]] of [[5-HT2A|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]] and [[5-HT1A|5-HT<sub>1A</sub>]] [[serotonin receptor]]s.{{cn|date=November 2013}}

==Toxicity==
Very little is known about the toxicity of 4-HO-MiPT. Its chemical structure and pharmacological activity are very similar to [[psilocin]], a compound which isn't associated with compulsive use or physical dependence. However, because very little research has been done on 4-HO-MiPT, it cannot be definitively concluded that its pharmacological actions in the human body do not differ from those of psilocin. To date, there have been no reported deaths from 4-HO-MiPT.{{cn|date=November 2013}}

==Duration==
Onset of action is 15 to 45 minutes and has a duration of 4 to 8 hours, depending on dose. the duration of action is one half-hour to two hours when injected IV.{{fact|date=February 2016}}

==Drug prohibition laws==

===Sweden===
[[Riksdag|''Sveriges riksdags'']] health ministry [[:sv:Statens folkhälsoinstitut|Statens folkhälsoinstitut]] classified 4-HO-MiPT as "health hazard" under the act ''[[:sv:Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor|Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor]]'' (translated ''Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health'') as of Nov 1, 2005,  in regulation SFS 2005:733 listed as "4-hydroxi-N,N-metylisopropyltryptamin (4-HO-MIPT)", making it illegal to sell or possess.<ref>http://www.notisum.se/rnp/sls/sfs/20050733.pdf</ref>

===UK===
The substance could also be considered illegal in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] under the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]].

===USA===
4-HO-MiPT is an [[Legal drugs|unscheduled drug]] in the United States. However, it is arguably an [[structural analog|analog]] of psilocin, which could lead to prosecution under the [[Federal Analog Act]].

===Russia===
4-HO-MiPT is in Shedule 1 in Russia as an analog of 4-hydroxytryptamine.
