'''Trospium chloride''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) is used to treat [[overactive bladder]].<ref name=emcXLlabel>UK eMC [https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/22236 Regurin XL 60mg] Last updated July 3, 2015</ref>

It has side effects typical of drugs like it, namely dry mouth, stomach upset, and constipation; these side effects cause problems with people taking their medicine as directed.  However it doesn't cause central nervous system side effects like other drugs of its class.<ref name=2009rev>{{cite journal |vauthors=Biastre K, Burnakis T | title = Trospium chloride treatment of overactive bladder | journal = Ann Pharmacother | volume = 43 | issue = 2 | pages = 283–95 |date=February 2009 | pmid = 19193592 | doi = 10.1345/aph.1L160 }}</ref>  It is pregnancy category C and is excreted somewhat in breast milk.<ref name=FDAlabel>FDA [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2011/021595s007lbl.pdf Trospium chloride label] Last updated January 2011</ref>

Chemically it is a [[quaternary ammonium cation]] which causes it to stay in periphery rather than crossing the [[blood-brain barrier]].<ref name=Quat2003>{{cite journal |vauthors=Pak RW, Petrou SP, Staskin DR | title = Trospium chloride : a quaternary amine with unique pharmacologic properties | journal = Curr Urol Rep | volume = 4 | issue = 6 | pages = 436–40 |date=December 2003 | pmid = 14622495 | doi = 10.1007/s11934-003-0023-1 }}</ref>  It works by causing the [[smooth muscle]] in the bladder to relax.<ref name=emcXLlabel/>

It was invented in the late 1960s in Germany and was first approved in Europe in 1999. It was first approved in the US in 2004, and an extended release version with once a day dosing was brought to market in 2007.  It became generic in Europe in 2009 and in the US the first extended-release generic was approved in 2012.

== Medical uses ==

Trospium chloride is used for the treatment of [[overactive bladder]] with symptoms of [[urge incontinence]] and [[frequent urination]].<ref name=emcXLlabel/><ref name=2009rev/><ref name=FDAlabel/>

It shouldn't be used with people who [[urinary retention|retain urine]], who have severe [[Human gastrointestinal tract#Disease|digestive conditions]], [[myasthenia gravis]], narrow-angle [[glaucoma]], or [[tachyarrhythmia]].<ref name=emcXLlabel/>

It should be used in caution with people who have problems with their [[autonomous nervous system]] ([[dysautonomia]]) or who have [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]], or in whom fast heart rates are undesirable, such as people with hyperthyroidism, coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure.<ref name=emcXLlabel/>

Trospium chloride is rated Pregnancy Category C,<ref name=FDAlabel/> as there are no adequate and well-controlled studies of trospium chloride in pregnant women and there were signs of harm to the fetus in animal studies. The drug was excreted somewhat in the milk of nursing mothers.<ref name=emcXLlabel/>  The drug was studied in children.<ref name=emcXLlabel/>

== Side effects ==
Side effects are typical of gastrointestinal effects of [[anticholinergic]] drugs, and include dry mouth, indigestion, and constipation.  These side effects lead to problems with adherence, especially for older people.<ref name=2009rev/>
The only CNS side effect is headache, which was very rare.  Tachycardia is a rare side effect.<ref name=emcXLlabel/>

== Mechanism of action ==

Trospium chloride is a [[muscarinic antagonist]]. Trospium chloride blocks the effect of [[acetylcholine]] on [[muscarinic]] receptors organs that are responsive to the compounds, including the [[bladder]].<ref name=emcXLlabel/> Its [[parasympatholytic]] action relaxes the smooth muscle in the bladder.<ref name=2009rev/>  Receptor assays showed that trospium chloride  has negligible affinity for nicotinic receptors as compared to muscarinic receptors at concentrations obtained from therapeutic doses.<ref name=emcXLlabel/>

== Pharmacokinetics ==

After oral administration, less than 10% of the dose is absorbed. Mean absolute [[bioavailability]] of a 20&nbsp;mg dose is 9.6% (range: 4.0 to 16.1%). Peak plasma concentrations (C<sub>max</sub>) occur between 5 and 6 hours post-dose. Mean [[Cmax (pharmacology)|C<sub>max</sub>]] increases greater than dose-proportionally; a 3-fold and 4-fold increase in C<sub>max</sub> was observed for dose increases from 20&nbsp;mg to 40&nbsp;mg and from 20&nbsp;mg to 60&nbsp;mg, respectively. [[Area under the curve (pharmacokinetics)|AUC]] exhibits dose linearity for single doses up to 60&nbsp;mg. Trospium chloride exhibits diurnal variability in exposure with a decrease in C<sub>max</sub> and AUC of up to 59% and 33%, respectively, for evening relative to morning doses.<ref name=PK>{{cite journal |vauthors=Doroshyenko O, Jetter A, Odenthal KP, Fuhr U | title = Clinical pharmacokinetics of trospium chloride | journal = Clin Pharmacokinet | volume = 44 | issue = 7 | pages = 701–20 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15966754 | doi =  10.2165/00003088-200544070-00003}}</ref>

Administration with a high fat meal resulted in reduced absorption, with AUC and C<sub>max</sub> values 70 to 80% lower than those obtained when trospium chloride was administered while fasting. Therefore, it is recommended that trospium chloride should be taken at least one hour prior to meals or on an empty stomach.<ref name=PK/>

Protein binding ranged from 50 to 85% when concentration levels of trospium chloride (0.5 to 50&nbsp;ng/mL) were incubated with human serum in vitro. The <sup>3</sup>H-trospium chloride ratio of plasma to whole blood was 1.6:1. This ratio indicates that the majority of <sup>3</sup>H-trospium chloride is distributed in plasma. The apparent volume of distribution for a 20&nbsp;mg oral dose is 395 (± 140) liters.<ref name=PK/>

The metabolic pathway of trospium in humans has not been fully defined. Of the 10% of the dose absorbed, metabolites account for approximately 40% of the excreted dose following oral administration. The major metabolic pathway is hypothesized as [[ester]] [[hydrolysis]] with subsequent [[Phase II metabolism#Phase II .E2.80.93 conjugation|conjugation]] of benzylic acid to form azoniaspironortropanol with [[glucuronic acid]]. [[Cytochrome P450]] is not expected to contribute significantly to the elimination of trospium. Data taken from in vitro human liver [[microsome]]s investigating the inhibitory effect of trospium on seven cytochrome P450 isoenzyme substrates (CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) suggest a lack of inhibition at clinically relevant concentrations.<ref name=PK/>

The plasma half-life for trospium chloride following oral administration is approximately 20 hours. After oral administration of an immediate-release formulation of <sup>14</sup>C-trospium chloride, the majority of the dose (85.2%) was recovered in feces and a smaller amount (5.8% of the dose) was recovered in urine; 60% of the radioactivity excreted in urine was unchanged trospium. The mean renal clearance for trospium (29 L/hour) is 4-fold higher than average glomerular filtration rate, indicating that active tubular secretion is a major route of elimination for trospium. There may be competition for elimination with other compounds that are also renally eliminated.<ref name=PK/>

==Chemical properties==
[[Anticholinergic]] drugs used to treat overactive bladder were all [[Amine#Classes of amines|amines]] as of 2003. [[Quaternary ammonium cations]] in general are more [[hydrophilic]] than other amines and don't cross membranes well, so they tend to be poorly absorbed from the digestive system, and to not cross the [[blood-brain barrier]].  [[Oxybutynin]], [[tolterodine]], [[darifenacin]], and [[solifenacin]] are tertiary amines while trospium chloride and [[propantheline]] are quaternary amines.<ref name=Quat2003/>

==History==
The synthesis of trospium was described by scientists from Dr. Robert Pfleger Chemische Fabrik GmbH,  Heinz Bertholdt, Robert Pfleger, and Wolfram Schulz, in US. Pat. No. 3,480,626 (the US equivalent to DE119442), and its activity was first published in the literature in 1967.<ref>See [https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US6974820.pdf US Patent 6,974,820], Column 1 lines 31-34. which cites  [https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US3480626.pdf US 3,480,626] and Bertholdt H, Pfleger R, Schulz W.

==Society and culture==
Marketing rights to the drug became subject to [[parallel import]] litigation in Europe in the case of Speciality European Pharma Ltd v Doncaster Pharmaceuticals Group Ltd / Madaus GmbH (Case No. A3/2014/0205) which was resolved in March 2015.  Madaus had exclusively licensed the right to use the Regurin trademark to Speciality European Pharma Ltd.   In 2009, when European patents expired on the drug, Doncaster Pharmaceuticals Group, a well known parallel importer, which had been selling the drug in the UK under another label, Ceris, which was used in France, began to put stickers on their packaging with the Regurin name.  Speciality and Madaus sued and inititally won based on the argument that 90% of prescriptions were already generic, but Doncaster appealed and won the appeal based on the argument that it could not charge a premium with a generic label.  The case has broad implications for trade in the EU.<ref name=lexology>Lexology.
