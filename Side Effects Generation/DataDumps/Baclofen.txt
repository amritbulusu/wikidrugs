'''Baclofen''', sold under the brand name '''Lioresal''' among others, is a [[medication]] used to treat [[spasticity]]. It serves as a [[central nervous system]] [[depressant]] and [[skeletal muscle relaxant]]. It is also used in topical creams to help with pain.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cherny|first1=Nathan|last2=Fallon|first2=Marie|last3=Kaasa|first3=Stein|last4=Portenoy|first4=Russell K.|last5=Currow|first5=David C.|title=Oxford Textbook of Palliative Medicine|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780191509483|page=585|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aBbdDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA585|language=en}}</ref>

Chemically it is a derivative of the [[neurotransmitter]] [[γ-aminobutyric acid]] (GABA). It is believed to work by [[GABA receptor agonist|activating (or agonizing) GABA receptors]], specifically the [[GABAB receptor|GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors]].<ref name="TGA">{{cite web|title=Product Information Clofen|website=TGA eBusiness Services|publisher=Alphapharm Pty Limited|date=7 June 2017|url=https://www.ebs.tga.gov.au/ebs/picmi/picmirepository.nsf/pdf?OpenAgent&id=CP-2010-PI-04975-3|accessdate=15 August 2017|location=Millers Point, Australia}}</ref> Its beneficial effects in [[spasticity]] result from its actions in the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]].<ref name="MD">{{cite web|title=Baclofen: Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference|publisher=Pharmaceutical Press|website=MedicinesComplete|date=9 January 2017|accessdate=15 August 2017|editor=Brayfield, A|url=https://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/martindale/current/5702-z.htm|location=London, UK}}</ref>

It is being studied along with [[naltrexone]] and [[sorbitol]] for [[Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease]] (CMT), a hereditary disease that causes [[peripheral neuropathy]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Attarian|first1=Shahram|last2=Vallat|first2=Jean-Michel|last3=Magy|first3=Laurent|last4=Funalot|first4=Benoît|last5=Gonnaud|first5=Pierre-Marie|last6=Lacour|first6=Arnaud|last7=Péréon|first7=Yann|last8=Dubourg|first8=Odile|last9=Pouget|first9=Jean|last10=Micallef|first10=Joëlle|last11=Franques|first11=Jérôme|last12=Lefebvre|first12=Marie-Noëlle|last13=Ghorab|first13=Karima|last14=Al-Moussawi|first14=Mahmoud|last15=Tiffreau|first15=Vincent|last16=Preudhomme|first16=Marguerite|last17=Magot|first17=Armelle|last18=Leclair-Visonneau|first18=Laurène|last19=Stojkovic|first19=Tanya|last20=Bossi|first20=Laura|last21=Lehert|first21=Philippe|last22=Gilbert|first22=Walter|last23=Bertrand|first23=Viviane|last24=Mandel|first24=Jonas|last25=Milet|first25=Aude|last26=Hajj|first26=Rodolphe|last27=Boudiaf|first27=Lamia|last28=Scart-Grès|first28=Catherine|last29=Nabirotchkin|first29=Serguei|last30=Guedj|first30=Mickael|last31=Chumakov|first31=Ilya|last32=Cohen|first32=Daniel|title=An exploratory randomised double-blind and placebo-controlled phase 2 study of a combination of baclofen, naltrexone and sorbitol (PXT3003) in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A|journal=Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases|date=2014|volume=9|issue=1|page=199|doi=10.1186/s13023-014-0199-0}}</ref> It is also being studied for cocaine addiction.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 2994240 | pmid=21120115 | volume=2 | title=New medications for the treatment of cocaine dependence | year=2005 | journal=Psychiatry (Edgmont) | pages=44–48 | last1 = Kampman | first1 = KM}}</ref>

==Side effects==
===Withdrawal syndrome===
Discontinuation of baclofen can be associated with a withdrawal syndrome which resembles [[benzodiazepine withdrawal]] and [[alcohol withdrawal]]. [[Withdrawal symptoms]] are more likely if baclofen is used for long periods of time (more than a couple of months) and can occur from low or high doses. The severity of baclofen withdrawal depends on the rate at which it is discontinued. Thus to minimise withdrawal symptoms, the dose should be tapered down slowly when discontinuing baclofen therapy. Abrupt withdrawal is more likely to result in severe withdrawal symptoms. Acute withdrawal symptoms can be stopped by recommencing baclofen.<ref name="dawbw">{{cite journal

=== Abuse potential ===
[[File:Baclosan.JPG|right|thumb|Russian baclofen (branded Baclosan) 25 mg tablets with a warning: "This drug may suppress psychomotor skills"]]
Baclofen, at standard dosing, does not produce [[euphoria]] or other [[Brain stimulation reward|pleasant]] effects, does not possess [[drug addiction|addictive]] properties, and has not been associated with any degree of [[craving (withdrawal)|drug craving]].<ref name="LiuWang2015">{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Jia|last2=Wang|first2=Lu-Ning|last3=Liu|first3=Jia|title=Baclofen for alcohol withdrawal|year=2015|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008502.pub4|pmid=25836263|volume=4|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|page=CD008502}}</ref><ref name="AgabioPreti2013">{{cite journal|last1=Agabio|first1=Roberta|last2=Preti|first2=Antonio|last3=Gessa|first3=Gian Luigi|title=Efficacy and Tolerability of Baclofen in Substance Use Disorders: A Systematic Review|journal=European Addiction Research|volume=19|issue=6|year=2013|pages=325–45|issn=1421-9891|doi=10.1159/000347055}}</ref> There are very few cases of [[drug abuse|abuse]] of baclofen for reasons other than [[attempted suicide]].<ref name="LiuWang2015" /> In contrast to baclofen, another GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor agonist, [[γ-hydroxybutyric acid]] (GHB), has been associated with euphoria, abuse, and addiction.<ref name="van NieuwenhuijzenMcGregor2009">{{cite journal|last1=van Nieuwenhuijzen|first1=P.S.|last2=McGregor|first2=I.S.|last3=Hunt|first3=G.E.|title=The distribution of γ-hydroxybutyrate-induced Fos expression in rat brain: Comparison with baclofen|journal=Neuroscience|volume=158|issue=2|year=2009|pages=441–55|issn=0306-4522|doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.10.011}}</ref> These effects are likely mediated not by activation of the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor, but rather by activation of the [[GHB receptor]].<ref name="van NieuwenhuijzenMcGregor2009" /> Although baclofen does not produce euphoria or other reinforcing effects, which is unlike [[drinking alcohol|alcohol]] and [[benzodiazepine]]s (as well as GHB), it does similarly possess [[sedative]] and [[anxiolytic]] properties.<ref name="AgabioPreti2013" />

===Overdose===
Reports of [[overdose]] indicate that baclofen may cause symptoms including [[vomiting]], [[asthenia|weakness]], [[sedation]], [[somnolence]], [[hypoventilation|respiratory depression]], [[seizure]]s, unusual pupil size, dizziness,<ref name="FDAPrescribingInfo">{{cite web | title = Gablofen (Baclofen) FDA Full Prescribing Information | url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2010/022462s000lbl.pdf | work = US Food and Drug Administration | accessdate = 2016-01-21}}</ref> headaches,<ref name="FDAPrescribingInfo" /> [[itching]], [[hypothermia]], [[bradycardia]], [[hypertension]], [[hyporeflexia]], [[coma]], and [[death]].<ref name="Perry1998">{{cite journal|title=Baclofen Overdose: Drug Experimentation in a Group of Adolescents|journal=Pediatrics|volume=101|issue=6|year=1998|pages=1045–48|issn=0031-4005|doi=10.1542/peds.101.6.1045}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Baclofen produces its effects by activating the [[GABAb receptor|GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor]], similar to the drug [[phenibut]] which also activates this receptor and shares some of its effects. Baclofen is postulated to block mono-and-polysynaptic reflexes by acting as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, blocking the release of excitatory transmitters. However, baclofen does not have significant affinity for the [[GHB receptor]], and has no known abuse potential.<ref name="Carter-2009">{{cite journal | last1 = Carter | first1 = L.

Similarly to phenibut (β-phenyl-GABA), as well as [[pregabalin]] (β-isobutyl-GABA), which are close analogues of baclofen, baclofen (β-(4-chlorophenyl)-GABA) has been found to block [[Voltage-dependent calcium channel#α2δ Subunit|α<sub>2</sub>δ subunit]]-containing [[voltage-gated calcium channel]]s (VGCCs).<ref name="pmid26234470">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zvejniece L, Vavers E, Svalbe B, Veinberg G, Rizhanova K, Liepins V, Kalvinsh I, Dambrova M | title = R-phenibut binds to the α2-δ subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels and exerts gabapentin-like anti-nociceptive effects | journal = Pharmacol.

As such, the actions of baclofen on α<sub>2</sub>δ subunit-containing VDCCs are likely not clinically-relevant.<ref name="pmid26234470" />

==Description of compound==
Baclofen is a white (or off-white) mostly odorless [[crystalline]] powder, with a [[molecular weight]] of 213.66&nbsp;g/mol. It is slightly [[soluble]] in water, very slightly soluble in [[methanol]], and insoluble in [[chloroform]].

==Pharmacokinetics==

The drug is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and is widely distributed throughout the body. Biotransformation is low and the drug is predominantly excreted unchanged by the kidneys.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00558228 | title = Plasma and urinary excretion kinetics of oral baclofen in healthy subjects | year = 1989 | last1 = Wuis | first1 = E.

== History ==

Historically, baclofen was designed as a drug for treating epilepsy. It was first made at [[Ciba-Geigy]], by the Swiss chemist Heinrich Keberle, in 1962.<ref>{{Cite book| last1= Froestl | first1= Wolfgang |editor=Blackburn, Thomas P.| title= GABAb Receptor Pharmacology – A Tribute to Norman Bowery | chapter= Chemistry and Pharmacology of GABAb Receptor Ligands | journal= Advances in Pharmacology|publisher=Academic Press | volume= 58 | pages= 19–62 | year= 2010 | isbn= 978-0-12-378647-0 | doi= 10.1016/S1054-3589(10)58002-5 | url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=_iMDQOA2UIsC&pg=PA19}}

Currently, baclofen continues to be given by mouth, with variable effects. In severely affected children, the oral dose is so high that side-effects appear, and the treatment loses its benefit. How and when baclofen came to be used in the spinal sac ([[intrathecal]]ly) remains unclear, but {{as of | 2012 | lc = on}}, this has become an established method of treating spasticity in many conditions.{{citation needed|reason=Unsubstantiated claims about clarity and scope.|date=July 2016}}

In his 2008 book, ''[[Le Dernier Verre]]'' (translated literally as ''The Last Glass'' or ''The End of my Addiction''), French-American cardiologist [[Olivier Ameisen]] described how he treated his alcoholism with baclofen. Inspired by this book, an anonymous donor gave $750,000 to the [[University of Amsterdam]] in the Netherlands to initiate a clinical trial of high-dose baclofen, which Ameisen had called for since 2004.<ref name=SCIAMEISEN>{{cite journal | last1= Enserink | first1= M. | year= 2011 | title= Anonymous Alcoholic Bankrolls Trial of Controversial Therapy | journal= Science | volume= 332 | issue= 6030 | page= 653 | doi= 10.1126/science.332.6030.653 | pmid= 21551041 | url= http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6030/653.full | accessdate= 2011-05-06 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110511171232/http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6030/653.full | archivedate= 11 May 2011 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>

=== Routes of administration ===
[[File:005915731lg Baclofen 20 MG Oral Tablet.jpg|left|thumb|Baclofen 20 mg oral tablet]]
Baclofen can be administered transdermally as part of a pain-relieving and muscle-relaxing cream mix at a compounding pharmacy, orally<ref>[http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?id=3736#nlm34089-3 CID 3738, Tablet]</ref> or ''intrathecally''<ref>[https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=2284 CID 2284]</ref> (directly into the cerebral spinal fluid) using a pump implanted under the skin.

[[Intrathecal pump]]s offer much lower doses of baclofen because they are designed to deliver the medication directly to the spinal fluid rather than going through the digestive and blood system first. They are often preferred in [[spasticity]] patients such as those with [[spastic diplegia]], as very little of the oral dose actually reaches the spinal fluid. Besides those with spasticity, intrathecal administration is also used in patients with [[multiple sclerosis]] who have severe painful spasms which are not controllable by oral baclofen. With pump administration, a test dose is first injected into the spinal fluid to assess the effect, and if successful in relieving spasticity, a chronic intrathecal catheter is inserted from the spine through the abdomen and attached to the pump which is implanted under the abdomen's skin, usually by the ribcage. The pump is computer-controlled for automatic dosage and the reservoir in the pump can be replenished by [[percutaneous]] injection. The pump also has to be replaced about every 5 years due to the battery life and other wear.
