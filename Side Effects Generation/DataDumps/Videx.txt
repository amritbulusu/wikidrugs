'''Videx, Inc.''' is a [[Corvallis, Oregon]] [[manufacturer]] of computer hardware such as [[access control]] products and [[data collection]] [[Computer terminal|terminals]]. Its initial success came with the first release of the $345 Videoterm (80 column) [[display card]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mirrors.apple2.org.za/Apple%20II%20Documentation%20Project/Interface%20Cards/80%20Column%20Cards/Videx%20Videoterm/|date=November 1982|last1=White|first1=Curtis|last2=Aldrich|first2=Darrell|title=Videx Videoterm, Installation and Operation Manual}}</ref> in March 1980 and the $149 shift and custom keyboard mapping Enhancer II terminal card in November 1981, both for [[Apple II]] computers.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Warren |first=Carl |date=June 1982 |title=Computer Bits, New Boards Work - and Play - Hard |url=http://www.classiccmp.org/cini/pdf/pe/1982/PE1982-Jun-pg72.pdf |magazine=Popular Electronics |access-date= 27 May 2016}}</ref>  Later, in 1984, it released its $379 UltraTerm [[expansion card]] boasting high-definition 96-pixel characters and up to 128 x 32 character display.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Mar |first=Jerry |date=September 1984 |title=Videx Ultraterm; high fidelity display for Apple |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v10n9/37_Videx_Ultraterm_high_fid.php |magazine=Creative Computing |access-date= 27 May 2016}}</ref> These products became obsolete when [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] released the [[Apple IIe]] with most of the 80-column card hardware built-in - only a much simpler and cheaper RAM card was then required.
