<!-- Definition and medical uses -->
'''Oxymorphone''', sold under the brand names '''Numorphan''' among others, is a powerful [[semi-synthetic]] [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] (painkiller) developed in [[Germany]] in 1914. Pain relief after injection begins after about 5–10 minutes and 15–30 minutes after rectal administration, and lasts about 3–4 hours for immediate-release tablets and 12 hours for extended-release tablets.<ref name="OUP09" /> It is highly addictive and in June 2017, due to the [[opioid epidemic]] the US, the [[FDA]] asked the manufacturer to remove its product from the US market.<ref>Chem. Eng. News 95(25), 8, 2017</ref>

== Medical uses ==
Oxymorphone is indicated for the relief of moderate to severe pain and also as a preoperative medication to alleviate [[Anxiety|apprehension]], maintain anaesthesia and as an obstetric analgesic. It can be used to  alleviate pain in [[dyspnea]] associated with acute [[left ventricular failure]] and [[pulmonary edema]].<ref name = MD>{{cite web|title=Oxymorphone Hydrochloride|work=Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference|publisher=Pharmaceutical Press|date=30 January 2013|accessdate=5 May 2014|url=http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/martindale/current/6249-a.htm|editor=Brayfield, A}}</ref> It has practically no [[antitussive|cough suppressing]] activity.<ref name = MD/>

Oxymorphone extended-release tablets are indicated for the management of chronic pain and only for people already on a regular schedule of strong opioids for a prolonged period. Immediate-release oxymorphone tablets are recommended for breakthrough pain for people on the extended-release version. Some protocols for severe breakthrough pain in chronic pain conditions add Numorphan ampoules as a third form of the drug. As of 2009, an oxymorphone nasal spray was being developed for this purpose with unknown release date; some practitioners prefer [[fentanyl]] immediate-release formulations such as [[Actiq]] or [[Fentora]] for this purpose despite fentanyl's occasional severe side effects.<ref name="OUP09">{{Cite book | isbn = 978-0-19-157532-7 | title = Opioids in Cancer Pain | last1 = Davis | first1 = MP | author2 = Glare, PA | author3 = Hardy, J | edition = 2nd | year = 2009 | origyear = 2005 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford, UK  | pages =  }}</ref>
In the United States it is a Schedule II controlled substance with an [[ACSCN]] of 9652. {{cn|date=June 2017}}

== Adverse effects ==
The principal adverse effects of oxymorphone are similar to other opioids with constipation, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, dry mouth and drowsiness being the most common adverse effects. This drug is highly addictive as with other opioids and can lead to chemical dependence and withdrawal.<ref name = MD/>

===Overdose===
In common with other opioids, oxymorphone overdosage is characterized by respiratory depression, sleepiness progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle [[flaccidity|weakness]], cold and clammy skin, and sometimes [[bradycardia|slow heart rate]] and [[hypotension|low blood pressure]]. In a severe case of overdose, [[apnea]], [[circulatory collapse]], [[cardiac arrest]] and death can occur.<ref name = MD/>

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
It elicits its effects by binding to and activating the [[mu opioid receptor]] (MOR) and, to a lesser extent, the [[delta opioid receptor]] (DOR).<ref name = OUP09/> Its activity at the DOR likely augments its action at the MOR.<ref name = OUP09/> Oxymorphone is 10 times more potent than morphine.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Prommer|first1=E|title=Oxymorphone: a review|journal=Supportive Care in Cancer|date=February 2006|volume=14|issue=2|pages=109–15|pmid=16317569|doi=10.1007/s00520-005-0917-1}}</ref>

===Pharmacokinetics===
{{See also|Oxycodone#Metabolism}}

==Chemistry==
Oxymorphone is commercially produced from [[thebaine]], which is a minor constituent of the [[opium poppy]] (''Papaver somniferum'') but thebaine is found in greater abundance (3%) in the roots of the [[oriental poppy]] (''Papaver orientale'').<ref name = OUP09/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Corrigan|first=D|author2=Martyn, EM|title=The thebaine content of ornamental poppies belonging to the papaver section oxytona.|journal=Planta Medica|date=May 1981|volume=42|issue=1|pages=45–9|doi=10.1055/s-2007-971544|pmid=17401879}}</ref>
German patents from the middle 1930s indicate that oxymorphone as well as [[hydromorphone]], [[hydrocodone]], [[oxycodone]], and [[acetylmorphone]] can be prepared—without the need for hydrogen gas—from solutions of [[codeine]], [[morphine]], and [[dionine]] by refluxing an acidic aqueous solution, or the precursor drug dissolved in [[ethanol]], in the presence of Column 7 metals{{explain|date=June 2017}}, namely [[palladium]] and [[platinum]] in fine powder or colloidal form or platina black.  It is unclear if [[aluminium]] or [[nickel]] can be used as a catalyst in these reactions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/dihydromorphinones.html |title=Dihydromorphinones from Morphine and Analogs - [www.rhodium.ws&#93; |publisher=Erowid.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-03}}</ref>

Oxymorphone hydrochloride occurs as odourless white crystals or white to off-white powder. It darkens in colour with prolonged exposure to light. One gram of oxymorphone hydrochloride is soluble in 4 ml of water and it is sparingly soluble in alcohol and ether. It degrades upon contact with light.<ref name = MD/>

Oxymorphone can be acetylated like morphine, hydromorphone, and some other opioids. Mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra- esters of oxymorphone were developed in the 1930s but are not used in medicine at this time.  Presumably other esters such as nicotinyl, benzoyl, formyl, cinnimoyl &c.can be produced.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

The 2013 US [[DEA]] annual manufacturing quotas were 18 375 kilogrammes for conversion (a number of drugs can be made from oxymorphone, both painkillers and [[opioid antagonist]]s like [[naloxone]]) and 6875 kg for direct manufacture of end-products.<ref>http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/quotas/2013/fr0620.htm</ref> Oxymorphone is also a minor metabolite of [[oxycodone]], which is formed by [[CYP2D6]]-mediated O-demethylation.<ref name="OUP09" />

* Numorphan (suppository and injectable solution)
* Opana ER (extended-release tablet): June 2017 FDA removal request due to rates of IV abuse.<ref name=fda>{{cite web|first1=Office of the|last1=Commissioner|accessdate=2017-06-15|title=Press Announcements - FDA requests removal of Opana ER for risks related to abuse|url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm562401.htm|website=www.fda.gov}}</ref>
* Opana IR (immediate-release tablet)

The brand name Numorphan is derived by analogy to the Nucodan name for an [[oxycodone]] product (or vice versa) as well as Paramorphan/Paramorfan for [[dihydromorphine]] and Paracodin ([[dihydrocodeine]]).  The only commercially available salt of oxymorphone in most of the world at this time is the [[hydrochloride]], which has a free base conversion ratio of 0.891, and oxymorphone hydrochloride monohydrate has a factor of 0.85.<ref name = MD/> 

Generic pill markings are ATV10/APO; HK10 (10 mgs) oblong white and ATV20/APO; HK20 (20mgs) oblong white.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

In January 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported an illness associated with intravenous (IV) abuse of oral Opana ER (oxymorphone) in Tennessee. The syndrome resembled that of [[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]] (TTP).<ref>{{cite journal |title=Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)-like illness associated with intravenous Opana ER abuse--Tennessee, 2012 |journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report |volume=62 |issue=1 |pages=1–4 |year=2013 |pmid=23302815 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6201a1.htm |author1=Centers for Disease Control Prevention (CDC) }}</ref> Initial therapy included therapeutic [[plasma exchange]], as for TTP.

In June 2017, the FDA asked Endo Pharmaceuticals to remove Opana ER from the US market, because vis a vis the [[opioid epidemic]] the drug´s benefits may no longer outweigh its risks, this being the first time the agency has taken steps to remove a currently marketed opioid pain medication from sale due to  public health consequences of abuse.<ref name=fda/> In 1924, the United States Congress had banned the sale, importation, or manufacture of [[heroin]], another opioid pain medication  in the [[Anti-Heroin Act of 1924]].
