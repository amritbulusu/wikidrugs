'''2C-T-7''' is a [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] [[phenethylamine]] of the [[2C (psychedelics)|2C family]]. In his book ''[[PiHKAL|PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story]]'', [[Alexander Shulgin]] lists the dosage range as 10 to 30 [[milligram|mg]]. '''2C-T-7''' is generally taken [[Mouth|orally]], and produces [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] and [[empathogen-entactogen|entactogenic]] effects that last 8 to 15 hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal043.shtml|title=PIHKAL #43|author=Alexander Shulgin}}</ref> Up until [[Operation Web Tryp]] and three deaths, two of which involved the use of other drugs in addition to 2C-T-7, and one which involved an excessive insufflated dose, 2C-T-7 was sold commercially in Dutch and Japanese [[smartshop]]s and online. It is known on the streets as '''Blue Mystic''' or '''7th Heaven'''.<ref>Platoni, Kara. "2C-T-7's Bad Trip". East Bay Express May 1, 2002: "In 1999 it made its first commercial appearance in the Netherlands' drug-dealing smart shops in both tablet and powder form. It was given the street name "Blue Mystic," perhaps in order to differentiate it from its chemical cousin, another Shulgin creation named [[2C-T-2]]"</ref><ref>O'Connell, Chris. "A psychedelic summer". Newsweek Aug. 19 2002: http://www.newsweek.com/id/65381?tid=relatedcl</ref><!-- Please do NOT add more slang terms without providing reliable sources for their importance and widespread use --> There has been little real research done on this chemical other than Shulgin's comments in PiHKAL and a few small animal studies mostly aimed at detecting metabolites.

==Pharmacology==
The mechanism that produces the psychedelic and entactogenic effects of 2C-T-7 is most likely to result from action as a [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]] [[5-HT receptor|serotonin receptor]] [[agonist]] in the brain, a mechanism of action shared by all of the hallucinogenic tryptamines and phenethylamines.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fantegrossi|first=WE|author2=Harrington AW |author3=Eckler JR |author4=Arshad S |author5=Rabin RA |author6=Winter JC |author7=Coop A |author8=Rice KC |author9=Woods JH  |date=September 2005|volume=181|issue=3|pages=496–503|title=Hallucinogen-like actions of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(n)-propylthiophenethylamine (2C-T-7) in mice and rats|journal=Psychopharmacology|doi=10.1007/s00213-005-0009-4|pmid=15983786}}</ref>

==Effects==

2C-T-7 is psychedelic. In PiHKAL, Shulgin records that the hallucinations are unique, and that the chemical may cause muscle tension and an altered vocal quality. Shulgin suggested reading about amateur research on 2C-T-7's effects.<ref name="coleads">{{cite web

The drug can be taken orally or snorted, although nasal administration is reported to be extremely painful.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/issues/2002-05-01/news/feature.html|title=2C-T-7's Bad Trip|author=East Bay Express|date=January 2, 2007}}</ref> Use of 2C-T-7 as a [[nootropic]] at low doses of 1–10&nbsp;mg has been reported, and it may be useful for this purpose in a similar manner to [[LSD]], which shows modest stimulant and nootropic effects at doses of 10&nbsp;µg.

==Deaths==
The [[Partnership for a Drug-Free America]] reports that 2C-T-7 can be lethal even in small doses;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugfree.org/Portal/Drug_guide/2C-B_2C-T-7|title=2C-B, 2C-T-7|author=Partnership for a Drug-Free America|authorlink=Partnership for a Drug-Free America|accessdate=October 4, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061019162712/http://www.drugfree.org/Portal/drug_guide/2C-B_2C-T-7| archivedate=October 19, 2006<!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> however, they provide no source for their claim and of the three known deaths of 2C-T-7 intoxicated individuals, all involved either excessive [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflated]] doses or the concomitant ingestion of other stimulants such as ephedrine and MDMA. There have been at least three reported deaths related to 2C-T-7 use as of August 2007, mainly at insufflated doses of 30&nbsp;mg or more<ref>Curtis, B. "Postmortem Identification and Quantitation of 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-n-propylthiophenethylamine Using GC-MSD and GC-NPD". ''Journal of Analytical Toxicology'' 27.7 (2003): 493–98: "This compound was initially identified from a routine screening procedure in postmortem urine from a 20-year-old male that died in a local emergency room after reportedly insufflating 35 mg."</ref><ref>Platoni, Chris. "A psychedelic summer". ''East Bay Express'', May 1, 2002: "In the same month, Joshua Robbins, a seventeen-year-old from Cordova, Tennessee, died after snorting between thirty and thirty-five milligrams of 2C-T-7, not long after taking several other stimulant drugs. According to ''Rolling Stone'', which ran an article on Robbins' death, in the twelve hours before he died Robbins also had consumed Ecstasy, nitrous oxide, and a 'mini-thin' containing ephedrine and guaifenisen."</ref> or combined with stimulants such as [[MDMA]],<ref>"In the fall of 2000, a young healthy male died following snorting an excessive amount of 2C-T-7. Since this initial 2C-T-7-related death, two additional deaths reported in April 2001 have been linked to 2C-T-7. These two deaths resulted from the co-abuse of 2C-T-7 with MDMA." http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drugs_concern/2ct7.htm</ref> as well as a number of very uncomfortably intense effects and hospitalizations, these mostly followed insufflation of 2C-T-7. In January 2002, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' published an article about 2C-T-7 entitled "The New (legal) Killer Drug",<ref>"The New (Legal) Killer Drug". ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', January 10, 2002, issue 888: 44–49.</ref> although the legal status of the drug was misrepresented in the article, as 2C-T-7 may have been already illegal under the United States' legally ambiguous analog act.<ref>21 USC §813</ref> A detailed response on the website Disinformation challenged the accuracy of much of the reporting in that ''Rolling Stone'' article.<ref>"The new (hip) drug hysteria: a journey into rolling stone's abandonment of journalistic ethics" by Ken Lilly on Disinformation (2002): http://www.disinfo.com/archive/pages/article/id2071/pg1/index.html</ref>

All of these known deaths of individuals under the influence of 2C-T-7, therefore, occurred in those known either to be intoxicated with potentially deadly<ref>Baldessarini M.D., Ross J. "SYMPOSIUM: BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION BY DRUGSI. PHARMACOLOGY OF THE AMPHETAMINES". ''Pediatrics'' 49.5 (May 1972): 694–701.</ref> stimulants such as [[ephedrine]] or [[MDMA]] or after the individual insufflated an excessive amount of 2C-T-7—excessive being an amount greater than necessary to induce the full range of the drug's effects, such as the reported 35&nbsp;mg insufflated dose taken by the individual who died in the fall of 2000.  This reported dose was characterized as "excessive" by the US DEA.

==Legal status==
Around the year 2000, 2C-T-7 began to change from an obscure chemical to a drug used at parties and clubs in North America and Europe as it became available through a number of grey-market commercial vendors. This aroused the attention of the authorities, and many countries have since scheduled the chemical.

===Germany===
2C-T-7 is scheduled in Germany. (BTMG)

===Australia===
In Australia, [[2C-T-2]] and 2C-T-7 are covered by the country's [[analog (chemistry)|analogue]] drug laws.

===Canada===
2C-T-7 is not scheduled in Canada.<ref>http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-38.8/</ref>

As of October 31, 2016; 2C-T-7 is a controlled substance (Schedule III) in Canada.<ref>http://gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2016/2016-05-04/html/sor-dors72-eng.php</ref>

===China===
As of October 2015 2C-T-7 is a controlled substance in China.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sfda.gov.cn/WS01/CL0056/130753.html | title=关于印发《非药用类麻醉药品和精神药品列管办法》的通知 | publisher=China Food and Drug Administration | date=27 September 2015 | language=Chinese | accessdate=1 October 2015}}</ref>

===The Netherlands===
The Netherlands was the first country in the world to ban 2C-T-7, after being sold in smartshops for a short period. After 2C-T-2 was first banned, 2C-T-7 quickly appeared on the market, but was soon banned as well. 2C-T-7 is a list I drug of the [[Opium Law]].

===Sweden===
Schedule I in Sweden.<ref>http://www.lakemedelsverket.se/upload/lvfs/LVFS_2004-3.pdf</ref> 2C-T-7 was first classified as "health hazard" under the act [[:sv:Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor|''Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor'']] (translated ''Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health'') as of April 1, 1999, under '''SFS 1999:58'''<ref>http://www.notisum.se/rnp/sls/fakta/a9990058.HTM</ref> that made it illegal to sell or possess.

===UK===
In 1999, [[Alexander Shulgin]] was sent a copy of a letter from the [[British Home Office]] to several of its administrative associates that in effect placed all compounds listed in [[PiHKAL]] into Class A.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===US===
On September 20, 2002, 2C-T-7 was classified as a [[Schedule I (US)|Schedule I]] substance in the United States by an emergency ruling by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]]. On March 18, 2004, the DEA published a Final Rule in the Federal Register permanently placing 2C-T-7 in Schedule I. (69 FR 12794).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dea.gov/programs/forensicsci/microgram/mg0104/mg0104.html|title=Micgrogram Bulletin Jan 2004|author=DEA}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/ndic/pubs11/12207/12207p.pdf|format=PDF|title=2C-T-7 Fast Facts|author=U.S. [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]}}</ref><ref>[http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1308/1308_11.htm List of Schedule 1 drugs on the DEA Office of Diversion Control website]</ref>
