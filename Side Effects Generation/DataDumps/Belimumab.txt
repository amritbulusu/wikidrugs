Belimumab is approved in the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and Europe for treatment of SLE. However, the major phase III trials excluded the more severe cases of SLE with kidney and brain damage, so its effectiveness has not been demonstrated in those cases. A Phase III study for SLE patients with kidney disease is now recruiting.<ref>[http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01639339 Efficacy and Safety of Belimumab in Patients With Active Lupus Nephritis (BLISS-LN)], NCT01639339</ref>

U.S. F.D.A. reviewers were concerned that belimumab is only "marginally" effective, and that there were more deaths in the treatment group.

Belimumab's defenders said that in addition to its modest efficiency, belimumab allowed patients to significantly reduce their use of corticosteroids.<ref>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/739330_2 Should Belimumab Have Been Approved? Stephen Paget, Medscape Rheumatology, Mar 24, 2011]</ref>

Belimumab is expensive, typically $28,000 for the first year. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) calculated the cost of belimumab at £61,200 per [[quality-adjusted life year]] (QALY), which is more than the normally accepted £20,000 to £30,000.

Phase II trials of belimumab for rheumatoid arthritis were unsuccessful. Phase II trials for Sjögren’s Syndrome were more successful.

Belimumab was developed by [[Human Genome Sciences]] (HGS) and [[Cambridge Antibody Technology]].<ref name="pmid14596803">{{cite journal

The 2 studies had a total of 1,684 patients, with scores of ≥6 on the SELENA-SLEDAI assessment. They were divided into a placebo and 2 dosage groups of belimumab, in addition to standard therapy. The primary end point was a reduction of ≥4 on the SELENA-SLEDAI assessment, and several other factors, at 52 weeks. Belimumab significantly improved the response rate, reduced disease activity and severe flares, and was well tolerated. 58% had SELENA-SLEDAI scores reduced by ≥4 points during 52 weeks with belimumab 10&nbsp;mg/kg compared to 46% with placebo.

Benlysta was the first new drug to treat lupus after 56 years. Sales rose to $31.2 million in the first quarter of 2012.<ref>[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hgsi-cuts-loss-benlysta-sales-184526054.html HGSI Cuts Loss on Benlysta Sales], By Zacks Equity Research, Apr 26, 2012</ref> It is marketed by [[GlaxoSmithKline]] and sold for about US$35,000 per year per patient.

===Rheumatoid arthritis===
In phase II clinical trials for [[rheumatoid arthritis]].<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00071812|A Safety and Efficacy Study of LymphoStat-B (Monoclonal Anti-BLyS Antibody) in Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis}},</ref> belimumab was not effective.<ref name="Manno"/>

==Side effects==
Common adverse effects reported with belimumab include nausea, diarrhea, fever, as well as hypersensitivity and infusion-site reactions (severe in 0.9% of patients). It is suggested that patients be treated with an [[antihistamine]] prior to a belimumab infusion.<ref name="EMA">[[European Medicines Agency]]: [http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Product_Information/human/002015/WC500110150.pdf Benlysta Summary of Product Characteristics]</ref>

A greater number of serious infections and deaths were reported in patients treated with belimumab than in those treated with [[placebo]]. Infections are due to the immunosuppressant properties of the drug.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsk.com/media/pressreleases/2011/2011_us_pressrelease_10017.htm |title=GlaxoSmithKline and Human Genome Sciences announce FDA approval of Benlysta (belimumab) for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus |accessdate=11 March 2011 |date=9 March 2011 |publisher=GlaxoSmithKline |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317151651/http://www.gsk.com/media/pressreleases/2011/2011_us_pressrelease_10017.htm |archivedate=March 17, 2011 }}</ref>

==Interactions==
No interaction studies have been carried out. Combination of belimumab with other [[immunosuppressants]], especially those targeting [[B lymphocyte]]s such as [[anti-CD20]] therapies, could increase the risk of severe infections. Likewise, the combination with intravenous [[cyclophosphamide]] is not recommended, as well as administering live vaccines during treatment with belimumab.<ref name="EMA" /><ref>Drugs.com: [http://www.drugs.com/pro/benlysta.html Benlysta Official FDA information, side effects and uses]</ref>

==Mechanism of action==

B lymphocytes (B cells) are one of the immune cells responsible for the damage in autoimmune disease. B cells develop in the bone marrow and continue to mature peripherally in secondary lymphoid organs and (as recently discovered) in the gut. When autoimmune B cells attack the body's own tissues, they are normally destroyed by cell suicide ([[apoptosis]]). In order to survive, B cells need survival factors. Researchers theorize that SLE is caused when autoimmune B cells proliferate, and survival factors protect them from cell suicide.

B-cell activating factor (BAFF), also called B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS), is required for the development and survival of B cells. In SLE, BAFF is overexpressed. Researchers theorize that BAFF overexpression causes autoimmune B cell proliferation and survival, which causes SLE.

Belimumab is a human antibody that binds to BAFF, preventing BAFF from binding to B cells. Without the survival factor BAFF, B cells commit suicide, and no longer contribute to the autoimmune damage of SLE.

BAFF is secreted by a variety of cells: [[monocyte]]s and [[macrophage]]s, [[bone marrow]] [[stromal cell]]s, [[astrocyte]]s, [[synoviocyte]]s during [[rheumatoid arthritis]], salivary epithelial cells during [[Sjögren's syndrome]], astrocytes in certain [[glioblastoma]]s.

BAFF interacts with three [[membrane receptor]]s on B lymphocytes:
* [[BAFF-R]] (BAFF receptor)
* [[TNFRSF17|BCMA]] (B cell maturation antigen)
* [[TACI]] (transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophylin ligand interactor)

When BAFF binds to BAFF-R and BCMA on B cells, levels of [[Bcl-2]], a survival factor, are increased.

When all three BAFF receptors are stimulated, levels of [[NF kappa B]], which contributes to [[cell proliferation]] and [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]], are increased in the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]].

Another B-cell activator like BAFF is APRIL ([[a proliferation-inducing ligand]]),<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schneider P |title=The role of APRIL and BAFF in lymphocyte activation |journal=Curr. Opin. Immunol. |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=282–9 |year=2005 |pmid=15886118 |doi=10.1016/j.coi.2005.04.005}}</ref> but APRIL only activates BCMA and TACI, not BAFF-R.

Belimumab reduces the number of circulating B cells, but anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies reduce the number even more. It is possible that belimumab binds primarily to circulating soluble BAFF, therefore not inducing [[antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity]] that could be expected from this [[Immunoglobulin G|IgG1]]-type antibody.<ref>June 2007 European League against Rheumatism symposium.</ref><SUP>[Better, more current citation needed]</SUP>

==Discovery and history==
B-cell activating factor is a naturally occurring [[protein]] that was discovered by researchers from [[National Jewish Health]] (previously the National Jewish Medical and Research Center) and the [[University of Colorado]], who collaboratively published a paper detailing their findings in May 1999, naming the protein ''TALL-1''.<ref name="pmid10331498">{{cite journal
