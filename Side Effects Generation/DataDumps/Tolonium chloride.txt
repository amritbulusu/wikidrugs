'''Tolonium chloride''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], also known as '''toluidine blue''' or '''TBO''') is a blue cationic (basic) dye used in [[histology]] and sometimes clinically.

== Test for lignin ==
Toluidine blue [[solution]] is used in testing for [[lignin]], a complex [[organic compound|organic molecule]] that bonds to [[cellulose]] fibres and strengthens and hardens the [[cell wall]]s in [[plants]]. A positive toluidine blue test causes the [[solution]] to turn from [[blue]] to [[pink]]. A similar test can be performed with [[phloroglucinol]]-[[HCl]] solution, which turns red.

==Other histological uses==
Toluidine Blue is often used to identify [[mast cell]]s, by virtue of the [[heparin]] in their [[Granule (cell biology)|cytoplasmic granules]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Histotechnology: A Self-Instructional Text |last1=Carson |first1=Freida L |last2=Hladik |first2=Christa |year=2009 |publisher=[[American Society for Clinical Pathology]] Press |location=Hong Kong |isbn=978-0-89189-581-7 |page=188 |edition=3 }}</ref> It is also used to stain [[proteoglycans]] and [[glycosaminoglycans]] in tissues such as cartilage. The strongly acidic macromolecular carbohydrates of mast cells and cartilage are coloured red by the blue dye, a phenomenon called [[metachromasia]].

Alkaline solutions of toluidine blue are commonly used for staining semi-thin (0.5 to 1 μm) sections of resin-embedded tissue. At high pH (about 10) the dye binds to nucleic acids and all proteins. Although everything in the tissue is stained, structural details are clearly visible because of the thinness of the sections. Semi-thin sections are used in conjunction with ultra-thin sections examined by [[electron microscopy]].

==Clinical uses==

The dye is sometimes used by surgeons to help highlight areas of [[mucous membrane|mucosal]] [[dysplasia]] (which preferentially take up the dye compared to normal tissue) in [[premalignant]] [[lesion]]s (e.g. [[leukoplakia]]).<ref name="Scully 2000">{{cite journal|last=Scully|first=C|author2=Porter, S |title=ABC of oral health. Swellings and red, white, and pigmented lesions.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=Jul 22, 2000|volume=321|issue=7255|pages=225–8|pmid=10903660|pmc=1118223|doi=10.1136/bmj.321.7255.225}}</ref> This can be used to choose the best site of the lesion to [[biopsy]], or during surgery to remove the lesion to decide whether to remove more tissue from the margins of the excision defect or leave it behind.
