'''Losmapimod''' ('''GW856553X''') is a drug developed by [[GlaxoSmithKline]] which acts as a selective inhibitor of the [[enzyme]] family known as [[p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases]].<ref>Aston N, Bamborough P, Buckton J, Edwards C, Holmes D, Jones K, Patel V, Smee P, Somers D, Vitulli G, Walker A. p38α Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Inhibitors: Optimization of a Series of Biphenylamides to Give a Molecule Suitable for Clinical Progression. ''Journal of Medicinal Chemistry'' 2009, 52(20), 6257. {{doi|10.1021/jm9004779}}</ref> 

[[p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases]] are mediators of [[inflammation]]. A Phase II human [[clinical trial]] for the treatment of [[COPD]] (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)<ref>[http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01218126 Randomised, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group, Multi-centre, Dose Ranging Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Losmapimod Tablets Administered Twice Daily Compared With Placebo for 24 Weeks in Adult Subjects With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)]</ref> is underway. Inhibiting these enzymes has been shown to produce [[antidepressant]] and [[antipsychotic]] effects in animal studies, with the mechanism thought to involve increased [[neurogenesis]]<ref>Noh JS, Kang HJ, Kim YE, Sohn S, Chung YK, Kim SU, Gwag BJ. Haloperidol-Induced Neuronal Apoptosis: role of p38 and c-Jun-NH(2)-terminal protein kinase. ''Journal of Neurochemistry'' 2000, 75(6), 2327. {{PMID|11080184}} {{doi|10.1046/j.1471-4159.2000.0752327.x}}</ref> probably related to [[BDNF]] release. Losmapimod has completed Phase II human [[clinical trials]] for the treatment of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] although its safety and efficacy have yet to be proven in further trials.<ref>[http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00569062 A Study of GW856553X For the Treatment of Depression]</ref>

Losmapimod is also being studied for cardiovascular disease.<ref>Cheriyan et al., Circulation 2011, 123(5), 515-523. Inhibition of p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Improves Nitric Oxide–Mediated Vasodilatation and Reduces Inflammation in Hypercholesterolemia {{doi|10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.971986}}</ref> A Phase II trial (LATITUDE) to study its effects in [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack) has been stopped in January 2016 because of disappointing results in phase A of the trial.<ref>[http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00910962 A Study to Evaluate the Safety of 12 Weeks of Dosing With GW856553 and Its Effects on Inflammatory Markers, Infarct Size, and Cardiac Function in Subjects With Myocardial Infarction Without ST-segment Elevation (Solstice)]</ref>
