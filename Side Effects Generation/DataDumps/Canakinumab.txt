In September 2016, FDA approved the use of canakinumab on 3 additional rare and serious auto-inflammatory diseases:<ref>{{cite news|title=FDA approves expanded indications for Ilaris for three rare diseases|publisher=FDA News Release|date=23 September 2016|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm522283.htm}}</ref> [[Tumor necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome]] (TRAPS), [[Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome]] (HIDS)/[[Mevalonate kinase deficiency]] (MKD) and [[Familial Mediterranean fever]] (FMF).

Canakinumab was being developed by [[Novartis]] for the treatment of [[rheumatoid arthritis]], but this trial was completed in October 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00784628 |title=clinicaltrials.gov, Identifier NCT00784628: Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of ACZ885 (Canakinumab) in Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis |accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref> Canakinumab is also in [[clinical trial#Phase I|phase I]] [[clinical trial]]s as a possible treatment for [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]],<ref>{{cite journal | title = Therapies for COPD | author = Yasothan U, Kar S | year = 2008 | journal = Nat Rev Drug Discov | doi = 10.1038/nrd2533 | volume = 7 | pages = 285 | issue=4}}</ref> [[gout]] and [[coronary artery disease]] (the CANTOS trial; <ref>http://www.thecantos.org/cantos-summary.html</ref>).

On Aug 27, 2017, the results of the CANTOS trial were announced at the [[European Society of Cardiology]] and published [[The Lancet|Lancet]] and the [[New England Journal of Medicine]].<ref name="wapost">{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Carolyn|title=Major drug study opens up vast new opportunities in combating heart disease|journal=The Washington Post|date=27 August 2017|accessdate=27 August 2017}}</ref> CANTOS saw a 15% reduction in deaths from heart attacks, stroke and cardiovascular disease combined. CANTOS also observed serious side-effects, and no statistically significant overall survival benefit. Nonetheless, David Goff, director of the division of cardiovascular sciences at the [[National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute]] feels the "public health impact potential is really substantial,” and estimates that in the United States 3 million people might benefit from canakinumab.<ref name="wapost"/> Further analysis on data from the CANTOS trial also showed a significant reduction in lung cancer incidence and mortality in the canakinumab treated group compared to placebo.
