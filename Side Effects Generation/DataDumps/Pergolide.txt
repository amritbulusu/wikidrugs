'''Pergolide''' (trade names '''Permax''', '''Prascend''') is an [[ergoline]]-based [[dopamine receptor]] [[agonist]] used in some countries for the [[therapy|treatment]] of [[Parkinson's disease]] (PD). PD is associated with reduced [[dopamine]] activity in the [[substantia nigra]] of the [[brain]]. Pergolide acts on many of the same receptors as dopamine to increase receptor activity. 

In 2007 pergolide was withdrawn from the U.S. market for human use after several published studies revealed a link between the drug and increased rates of [[valvular heart disease]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070408111551/http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/advisory/pergolide.htm FDA Public Health Advisory: Pergolide (marketed as Permax) ]</ref>  However, a veterinary form of pergolide, marketed under the trade name Prascend, is permitted for the treatment of [[pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction]] (PPID) also known as equine Cushing's syndrome (ECS) in horses.<ref>[http://www.wedgewoodpetrx.com/learning-center/professional-monographs/pergolide-for-veterinary-use.html]</ref>

== Indications ==
Pergolide is not available for use by humans in the United States, however it is still used in various other countries, where it is used to treat various conditions including Parkinson's disease, hyperprolactinemia, and restless leg syndrome.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
 
Pergolide is available for veterinary use. Under the trade name Prascend, manufactured by [[Boehringer Ingelheim]],<ref>http://www.valleyvet.com/ct_detail.html?pgguid=e0f4888c-86de-4ce9-9013-6d947df697a8&gas=pergolide%20mesylate</ref> it is commonly used for the treatment of pituitary [[pars intermedia]] hyperplasia or [[Pituitary Pars Intermedia Dysfunction|Equine Cushing's Syndrome]] (ECS) in horses.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wedgewoodpharmacy.com/monographs/pergolide.asp |title=Pergolide For Veterinary Use |author=Barbara Forney, VMD }}</ref>

== Pharmacology ==
Pergolide acts as an agonist of [[dopamine receptor|dopamine]] [[Dopamine receptor D2|D<sub>2</sub>]] and [[Dopamine receptor D1|D<sub>1</sub>]] and [[serotonin receptor|serotonin]] [[5-HT1A|5-HT<sub>1A</sub>]], [[5-HT1B|5-HT<sub>1B</sub>]], [[5-HT2A|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]], [[5-HT2B|5-HT<sub>2B</sub>]], and [[5-HT2C|5-HT<sub>2C</sub>]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s. It may possess agonist activity at other dopamine receptor subtypes as well, similar to cabergoline. Although pergolide is more potent as an agonist of the D<sub>2</sub> receptor, it has high D<sub>1</sub> receptor [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] and is one of the most potent D<sub>1</sub> receptor agonists of the [[dopamine receptor agonist]]s that are clinically available.<ref name="McClureHarvey2010">{{cite journal|last1=McClure|first1=Margaret M|last2=Harvey|first2=Philip D|last3=Goodman|first3=Marianne|last4=Triebwasser|first4=Joseph|last5=New|first5=Antonia|last6=Koenigsberg|first6=Harold W|last7=Sprung|first7=Larry J|last8=Flory|first8=Janine D|last9=Siever|first9=Larry J|title=Pergolide Treatment of Cognitive Deficits Associated with Schizotypal Personality Disorder: Continued Evidence of the Importance of the Dopamine System in the Schizophrenia Spectrum|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|volume=35|issue=6|year=2010|pages=1356–1362|issn=0893-133X|doi=10.1038/npp.2010.5|pmid=20130535|pmc=3055340}}</ref> The agonist activity of pergolide at the D<sub>1</sub> receptor somewhat alters its clinical and side effect profile in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

== Side effects ==
The drug is in decreasing use, as it was reported in 2003 to be associated with a form of heart disease called [[cardiac fibrosis]].<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.tga.gov.au/adr/aadrb/aadr0408.htm |date=August 2004 | title = Cardiac valvulopathy with pergolide | author = ADRAC | journal = Aust Adv Drug React Bull | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | authorlink = Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee}} [http://www.tga.gov.au/adr/aadrb/aadr0408.htm Free full text] from the [[Australia]]n [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]]</ref> In 2007, The United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] announced a voluntary withdrawal of the drug by manufacturers due to the possibility of heart valve damage.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PublicHealthAdvisories/ucm051285.html Public Health Advisory - Pergolide (marketed as Permax)]</ref> Pergolide is not currently available in the United States for human use. This problem is thought to be due to pergolide's action at the 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> serotonin receptors of cardiac myocytes, causing proliferative valve disease by the same mechanism as [[ergotamine]], [[methysergide]], [[fenfluramine]], and other serotonin 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> agonists, including serotonin itself when elevated in the blood in [[carcinoid syndrome]]. Pergolide can rarely cause [[Raynaud's phenomenon]]. Among similar antiparkinsonian drugs, [[cabergoline]] but not [[lisuride]] exhibit this same type of serotonin receptor binding.<ref>Jähnichen S, Horowski R, Pertz H. {{cite web|url= http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~hpertz/Presentation001.pdf |title="Pergolide and Cabergoline But not Lisuride Exhibit Agonist Efficacy at Serotonin 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> Receptors". }}&nbsp;{{small|(515&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}} Presentation.

===Claimed side effects===
At least one British pergolide user has attracted some media attention with claims that it has caused him to develop a [[gambling addiction]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/7207850.stm "Drug 'caused' gambling addiction" BBC TV 24 Jan. 2008]</ref><ref>[http://www.itv.com/Lifestyle/ThisMorning/Health/Parkinsonsgambler/default.html "Parkinson's Gambler" ITV.com 5 Feb. 2008]</ref> In June 2010, it was reported that more than 100 Australian users of the drug are suing the manufacturer over both gambling and [[sex addiction]]<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/national/parkinsons-treatment-linked-to-sex-gambling-20100603-x6y7.html "Parkinson's treatment linked to sex, gambling" 'The Age' 4 June 2010]</ref> problems they claim are the result of the drug's side effects.
