'''Digitoxin''' is a [[cardiac glycoside]]. It is a [[phytosteroid]] and is similar in [[chemical structure|structure]] and effects to [[digoxin]] (though the effects are longer-lasting). Unlike digoxin (which is eliminated from the body via the kidneys), it is eliminated via the liver, so could be used in patients with poor or erratic kidney function. However, it is now rarely used in current Western medical practice.  While several controlled trials have shown digoxin to be effective in a proportion of patients treated for heart failure, the evidence base for digitoxin is not as strong, although it is presumed to be similarly effective.<ref name=Belz>{{cite journal |author1=Belz, G.

==Toxicity==
Digitoxin exhibits similar toxic effects to the more commonly used [[digoxin]], namely: anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, confusion, visual disturbances, and cardiac [[arrhythmias]].  Antidigoxin antibody fragments, the specific treatment for digoxin poisoning, are also effective in serious digitoxin toxicity.<ref name=Kurowsky>{{cite journal |author1=Kurowski, V. |author2=Iven, H. |author3=Djonlagic, H. | title = Treatment of a patient with severe digitoxin intoxication by Fab fragments of anti-digitalis antibodies | journal = Intensive Care Medicine | volume = 18 | issue = 7 | pages = 439–442 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1469187 | doi = 10.1007/BF01694351 }}</ref>

==History==
The first description of the use of [[Digitalis purpurea|foxglove]] dates back to 1775.<ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tORsAAAAMAAJ | title = An Account of the Foxglove and Some of its Medical Uses: With Practical Remarks on Dropsy and other Diseases | author1 = Withering, William | year = 1785 }}</ref> For quite some time, the active compound was not isolated. [[Oswald Schmiedeberg]] was able to obtain a pure sample in 1875. The modern therapeutic use of this molecule was made possible by the works of the pharmacist and the French chemist [[Claude-Adolphe Nativelle]] (1812-1889). The first structural analysis was done by [[Adolf Otto Reinhold Windaus]] in 1925, but the full structure with an exact determination of the sugar groups was not accomplished until 1962.<ref>{{Cite journal

== Use in fiction ==
Digitoxin is used as a poison or murder weapon in:

* [[Agatha Christie]]'s ''[[Appointment with Death]]''
* [[Elizabeth Peters]]' ''[[Die For Love]]''
* ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'', season 9, episode 19: "The Descent of Man"
* ''[[Rosewood (TV series)|Rosewood]]'' season 2, episode 20: ''[[Rosewood (TV series)#ep42|Calliphoridae and Country Roads]]''
* "Casino Royale" (2006)
* "Uneasy Lies the Crown" on ''Columbo'', season 9, episode 5 (1990)
* "Affair of the Heart" on ''McMillan and Wife'', season 6, episode 5 (1977)
* ''Murder 101'': "College can be a Murder"
* Several episodes of Murder She Wrote.

In [[The Decemberists]]'s song, "The Rake's Song" on ''[[The Hazards of Love]]'' album, the narrator murders his daughter by feeding her foxglove.

== Use in cancer chemotherapy ==
Digitoxin and related cardenolides display potent anticancer activity against a range of human [[cancer]] cell lines in vitro but the clinical use of digitoxin to treat [[cancer]] has been restricted by its narrow [[therapeutic index]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Menger|first1=L|last2=Vacchelli|first2=E|last3=Kepp|first3=O|last4=Eggermont|first4=A|last5=Tartour|first5=E|last6=Zitvogel|first6=L|last7=Kroemer|first7=G|last8=Galluzzi|first8=L|title=Trial watch: Cardiac glycosides and cancer therapy|journal=Oncoimmunology|date=Feb 1, 2013|volume=2|issue=2|pages=e23082|pmid=23525565|doi=10.4161/onci.23082|pmc=3601180}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Elbaz|first1=HA|last2=Stueckle|first2=TA|last3=Tse|first3=W|last4=Rojanasakul|first4=Y|last5=Dinu|first5=CZ|title=Digitoxin and its analogs as novel cancer therapeutics|journal=Experimental Hematology & Oncology|date=Apr 5, 2012|volume=1|issue=1|pages=4|pmid=23210930|doi=10.1186/2162-3619-1-4|pmc=3506989}}</ref> Digitoxin [[glycorandomization]] led to the discovery of novel [[digitoxigenin]] neoglycosides which displayed improved anticancer potency and reduced ionotropic activity (the perceived mechanism of general toxicity).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Langenhan|first1=JM|last2=Peters|first2=NR|last3=Guzei|first3=IA|last4=Hoffmann|first4=FM|last5=Thorson|first5=JS|title=Enhancing the anticancer properties of cardiac glycosides by neoglycorandomization|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Aug 30, 2005|volume=102|issue=35|pages=12305–10|pmid=16105948|doi=10.1073/pnas.0503270102|pmc=1194917}}</ref> Steroidal glycosides based upon this latter discovery served as the basis for the development of a new class of [[antibody-drug conjugate]] known as extracellular drug conjugates (EDCs) as first in class agents to treat cancer by the biotechnology company Centrose.
