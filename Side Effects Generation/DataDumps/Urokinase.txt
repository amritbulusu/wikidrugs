'''Urokinase''', also known as '''urokinase-type plasminogen activator''' ('''uPA'''), is a [[serine protease]] present in humans and other animals. The human urokinase protein was discovered, but not named, by McFarlane and Pilling in 1947.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Degryse|first1=Bernard|title=The urokinase receptor system as strategic therapeutic target: challenges for the 21st century|journal=Current Pharmaceutical Design|date=1 June 2011|volume=17|issue=19|pages=1872–1873|doi=10.2174/138161211796718161}}</ref> Urokinase was originally isolated from human [[urine]], and it is also present in the [[blood]] and in the [[extracellular matrix]] of many tissues. The primary physiological substrate of this enzyme is [[plasminogen]], which is an inactive form ([[zymogen]]) of the serine protease [[plasmin]]. Activation of plasmin triggers a proteolytic cascade that, depending on the physiological environment, participates in [[thrombolysis]] or extracellular matrix degradation. This cascade had been involved in vascular diseases and cancer progression.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tang|first1=Linlin|last2=Han|first2=Xiuzhen|title=The urokinase plasminogen activator system in breast cancer invasion and metastasis|journal=Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy|date=March 2013|volume=67|issue=2|pages=179–182|doi=10.1016/j.biopha.2012.10.003}}</ref>

Urokinase is encoded in humans by the ''PLAU'' gene, which stands for "plasminogen activator, urokinase".<ref name="pmid2415429">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nagai M, Hiramatsu R, Kanéda T, Hayasuke N, Arimura H, Nishida M, Suyama T | title = Molecular cloning of cDNA coding for human preprourokinase | journal = Gene | volume = 36 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 183–8 | date = Dec 1985 | pmid = 2415429 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/0378-1119(85)90084-8 }}</ref> The same symbol represents the gene in other animal species.

== Function ==
The ''PLAU'' gene encodes a serine protease ({{EC number|3.4.21.73}}) involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix and possibly tumor cell migration and proliferation. A specific polymorphism in this gene may be associated with late-onset Alzheimer disease and also with decreased affinity for fibrin-binding. The protein encoded by this gene converts plasminogen to plasmin by specific cleavage of an Arg-Val bond in plasminogen. This gene's proprotein is cleaved at a Lys-Ile bond by plasmin to form a two-chain derivative in which a single disulfide bond connects the amino-terminal A-chain to the catalytically active, carboxy-terminal B-chain. This two-chain derivative is also called HMW-uPA (high molecular weight uPA). HMW-uPA can be further processed into LMW-uPA (low molecular weight uPA) by cleavage of chain A into a short chain A (A1) and an amino-terminal fragment. LMW-uPA is proteolytically active but does not bind to the uPA receptor.<ref>{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: PLAU plasminogen activator, urokinase| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=5328| accessdate = }}</ref>

== Structure ==
Urokinase is a 411-[[residue (chemistry)|residue]] [[protein]], consisting of three [[Domain (biology)|domains]]: the serine protease domain, the [[kringle domain]], and the [[growth factor domain]]. Urokinase is synthesized as a zymogen form (prourokinase or single-chain urokinase), and is activated by proteolytic cleavage between Lys158 and Ile159. The two resulting chains are kept together by a [[disulfide]] bond.

== Interaction partners ==
The most important inhibitors of urokinase are the [[serpin]]s [[plasminogen activator inhibitor-1]] (PAI-1) and [[plasminogen activator inhibitor-2]] (PAI-2), which inhibit the protease activity irreversibly. In the extracellular matrix, urokinase is tethered to the [[cell membrane]] by its interaction to the [[urokinase receptor]].

uPa also interacts with [[protein C inhibitor]].<ref name=pmid2752144>{{cite journal | vauthors = Geiger M, Huber K, Wojta J, Stingl L, Espana F, Griffin JH, Binder BR | title = Complex formation between urokinase and plasma protein C inhibitor in vitro and in vivo | journal = Blood | volume = 74 | issue = 2 | pages = 722–8 | date = Aug 1989 | pmid = 2752144 }}</ref><ref name=pmid2551064>{{cite journal | vauthors = España F, Berrettini M, Griffin JH | title = Purification and characterization of plasma protein C inhibitor | journal = Thromb.

== Urokinase and cancer ==
Elevated [[gene expression|expression]] levels of urokinase and several other components of the [[plasminogen activation system]] are found to be correlated with [[tumor]] [[malignancy]]. It is believed that the tissue degradation following plasminogen activation facilitates tissue invasion and, thus, contributes to [[metastasis]]. This makes urokinase an attractive [[drug target]], and, so, [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]]s have been sought to be used as anticancer agents.<ref name="pmid10738907">{{cite journal |vauthors=Jankun J, Skrzypczak-Jankun E | title = Molecular basis of specific inhibition of urokinase plasminogen activator by amiloride | journal = Cancer Biochem.

Through its interaction with the [[urokinase receptor]], urokinase affects several other aspects of cancer biology such as cell adhesion, migration, and cellular [[mitotic]] pathways.

== Clinical applications ==
Urokinase is used clinically as a [[thrombolysis|thrombolytic]] agent in the treatment of severe or massive [[deep venous thrombosis]], [[pulmonary embolism]], [[myocardial infarction]], and occluded [[intravenous]] or [[dialysis]] cannulas. It is also administered intrapleurally to improve the drainage of complicated pleural effusions and empyemas. Urokinase is marketed as Abbokinase or Kinlytic and competes with [[tissue plasminogen activator|recombinant tissue plasminogen activator]] (e.g., alteplase) as a thrombolytic drug in infarction. However, urokinase is not very selective for clot-bound plasminogen, unlike [[tissue plasminogen activator]] (TPA) which preferentially interacts with clot-bound plasminogen. Because urokinase binds about equally to freely circulating plasminogen and clot-bound plasminogen, it causes significant fibrinogenolysis and clot fibrinolysis making its use less favorable than TPA.<ref>http://www.cvpharmacology.com/thrombolytic/thrombolytic</ref>
