Lormetazepam is not approved for sale in the United States or Canada. It is licensed in the UK as 0.5 and 1&nbsp;mg tablets for short-term treatment (2–4 weeks) of moderately severe insomnia. It is licensed in the [[Netherlands]] as 1 and 2&nbsp;mg tablets, under the brand names Loramet and Noctamid and as generic, available from several manufacturers. It is sold in Poland as Noctofer.

The [[Netherlands|Dutch]], [[United Kingdom|British]], and [[France|French]] system called the System of Objectified Judgement Analysis for assessing whether drugs should be included in drug formularies based on clinical efficacy, [[adverse effect]]s, [[pharmacokinetic]] properties, [[toxicity]], and [[drug interaction]]s was used to assess lormetazepam. A [[Netherlands|Dutch]] analysis using the system found that lormetazepam could be suitable to be included in drug prescribing formularies, although [[zolpidem]], [[zopiclone]], and [[temazepam]] had higher scores and thus can be seen as relatively favorable.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Janknegt R, van der Kuy A, Declerck G, Idzikowski C |title=Hypnotics.

==Indications==
Lormetazepam is considered a [[hypnotic]] benzodiazepine and is officially indicated for [[Insomnia#Benzodiazepines|moderate to severe insomnia]]. Lormetazepam is a short-acting benzodiazepine and is sometimes used in patients who have difficulty in maintaining sleep or falling asleep. Hypnotics should only be used on a short-term basis or, in those with chronic insomnia, on an occasional basis.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Rickels K. |year= 1986 |title= The clinical use of hypnotics: indications for use and the need for a variety of hypnotics |journal= [[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]] Suppl. |volume= 74 |issue= S332 |pages= 132–41 |pmid= 2883820 |doi= 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1986.tb08990.x}}</ref>

==Side effects==
Side effects of lormetazepam are similar to those of other hypnotic benzodiazepines and can for the most part be regarded as a class effect.<ref>[http://www.bnf.org.uk/bnf/bnf/53/3141.htm British National Formulary Benzodiazepines Information]</ref> In a sleep study, 1&nbsp;mg lormetazepam increased total sleep time, reduced wakefulness, but did not alter [[REM sleep]]. However, at 2&nbsp;mg doses, there were significant increases in stage 3 sleep and reductions in REM sleep. [[Rebound effect]]s have been reported after chronic use including rebound REM.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=6120717 |pmc=1402107 |year=1982 |last1=Nicholson |first1=AN |last2=Stone |title=Hypnotic activity and effects on performance of lormetazepam and camazepam--analogues of temazepam |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=433–9 |journal=Br J Clin Pharmacol |first2=BM |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.1982.tb01398.x}}</ref> In one clinical trial with patients who had prior experience with older hypnotics [[temazepam]] and [[nitrazepam]], most preferred lormetazepam due to less heavy sedation, amnesia, and residual effects.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hill RC, Harry TV |title=Lormetazepam (Lorámet): a multicentre assessment of its efficacy and acceptability as a hypnotic in out-patients with sleep disturbances |journal=J. Int. Med. Res. |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=325–32 |year=1983 |pmid=6360746 |last2=Harry |doi=10.1177/030006058301100601}}</ref> Some side effects, including drowsiness, [[amnesia]], and respiratory depression, are increased when lormetazepam is combined with other drugs with similar effects, e.g. [[alcohol]] and [[nonbenzodiazepine]] drugs.

Although lormetazepam has been associated with adversely affecting immediate and delayed recall memory functions,<ref>{{cite journal |last= Dorow|author2=Berenberg D |author3=Duka T |author4=Sauerbrey N. |title= Amnestic effects of lormetazepam and their reversal by the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 |journal= Psychopharmacology |volume= 93 |issue= 4 |pages= 507–514 |year= 1987|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/t7203v38w371357k/ |doi=10.1007/bf00207244}}</ref> studies have shown that lormetazepam's amnesic properties may be lesser compared to other hypnotic benzodiazepines. For example, in a 1984 study comparing the amnesic effects of lormetazepam to temazepam and flurazepam showed that amnesia was smallest after lormetazepam and greatest after temazepam, which had produced greater amnesia than both lormetazepam and flurazepam by a significant margin.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Amnesic effects of lormetazepam |journal= Psychopharmacology Suppl. |volume= 1 |issue= 1 |pages= 165–72. |year= 1984|pmid= 6147838 |author= Roehrs T, McLenaghan A, Koshorek G, Zorick F, Roth T. |doi= 10.1007/978-3-642-69659-6_14 |series= Psychopharmacology Supplementum |isbn= 978-3-642-69661-9 |last2= McLenaghan |last3= Koshorek |last4= Zorick |last5= Roth}}</ref>

Side effects of lormetazepam include:

*[[somnolence]]
*paradoxical increase in aggression
*[[lightheadedness]]
*[[confusion]]
*muscle weakness
*[[ataxia]] (particularly in the elderly)
*[[anterograde amnesia]]
*[[headache]]

*[[urinary retention]]
*[[blood disorder]]s and [[jaundice]]
*[[skin]] reactions
*dependence and withdrawal reactions

Residual "hangover" effects after nighttime administration of lormetazepam such as sleepiness, impaired psychomotor and [[cognitive]] functions may persist into the next day which may impair the ability of users to drive safely and increase risks of falls and [[hip fracture]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Vermeeren A. |year= 2004 |title= Residual effects of hypnotics: epidemiology and clinical implications |journal= CNS Drugs. |volume= 18 |issue= 5 |pages= 297–328 |pmid= 15089115 |doi= 10.2165/00023210-200418050-00003}}</ref>

==Special precautions==
Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used during pregnancy, in children, in alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with [[comorbid]] [[psychiatric disorder]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Authier |first1= N. |last2= Balayssac |first2= D. |last3= Sautereau |first3= M. |last4= Zangarelli |first4= A. |last5= Courty |first5= P. |last6= Somogyi |first6= AA. |last7= Vennat |first7= B. |last8= Llorca |first8= PM. |last9= Eschalier |first9= A. |title= Benzodiazepine dependence: focus on withdrawal syndrome |journal= Ann Pharm Fr |volume= 67 |issue= 6 |pages= 408–13 |date=November 2009 |doi= 10.1016/j.pharma.2009.07.001 |pmid=19900604}}</ref> Lormetazepam may be unsuitable for the elderly due to residual effects on memory and body sway which may result in falls.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Allain H, Bentué-Ferrer D, Tarral A, Gandon JM |title=Effects on postural oscillation and memory functions of a single dose of zolpidem 5 mg, zopiclone 3.75 mg and lormetazepam 1 mg in elderly healthy subjects.

==Tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal==
It should be noted that the risks of tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal are very low when the drug is used for 2–4 weeks only and that lormetazepam is generally a safe and effective drug when used for no longer than 2–4 weeks. Some sleep disturbance in the form of rebound insomnia can, however, occur even after short-term usage of 7 days.<ref>{{cite journal

===Tolerance===
Lormetazepam as with other [[benzodiazepine]]s is generally only recommended for short-term use (2–4 weeks) due to tolerance and loss of [[efficacy]]. Tolerance to and loss of the [[sedative]] effects of [[benzodiazepine]] [[hypnotic]]s occurs within 14 days of regular use.<ref>Smith AE (1989) [http://www.benzo.org.uk/bznz.htm Benzodiazepines - Use & Abuse - A Guide for Prescribers]</ref>

===Dependence===
Dependence is the medical term for [[substance dependence|addiction]]. Dependence can either be psychological and/or physical.
Psychological dependence can manifest itself as a reliance on a drug to cope with everyday life or in the form of craving.
Physical dependence occurs due to physiological adaptations occurring as the body attempts to overcome the drugs effects which is known as tolerance and the continuing need to take the drug to avoid or suppress withdrawal symptoms which can sometimes resemble the original condition being treated. When the dose or the drug is discontinued withdrawal symptoms typically occur. Lormetazepam as with all other benzodiazepines produces both physical and psychological dependence but the main problem of concern is physical dependence which appears in the form of the [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]] after the dosage is reduced or the drug is stopped completely. The dependence induced by lormetazepam is related to changes in the sensitivity of the GABA-BZD receptor complex.<ref>{{cite journal

===Withdrawal symptoms===
Withdrawal symptoms which can occur from stopping benzodiazepines such as lormetazepam can include:<ref>Ashton CH [http://www.bcnc.org.uk/protracted.html Protracted Withdrawal Symptoms From Benzodiazepines] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821162913/http://www.bcnc.org.uk/protracted.html |date=August 21, 2006}}</ref>

*[[anxiety]], [[panic attack]]s, and [[agoraphobia]]
*clinical [[major depressive disorder|depression]]
*[[malaise]]
*lack of [[concentration]]
*[[abdominal]] discomfort
*[[depersonalisation]] and feelings of [[unreality]]
*[[emotion]]al [[lability]]
*[[cognitive impairment]]

*[[paraesthesiae]], [[paresthesia|tingling]], [[numbness]], and [[pain]]
*muscle pain, weakness, tension, painful [[tremor]], [[wikt:shaking|shaking]] attacks, jerks, blepharospasm

*[[stiffness]]
*[[sweat]]s
'''Abrupt or over rapid withdrawal from high doses can provoke:'''
*[[epileptic seizure]]s
*[[hallucination]]s (visual, auditory)
*misperceptions

Withdrawal symptoms typically subside after 4–8 weeks but in approximately 10-15% of individuals symptoms can persist for many months<ref>Ashton CH [http://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/bzcha01.htm Benzodiazepines: How They Work And How To Withdraw]</ref> and in rare cases years.<ref>Lader M [http://www.bcnc.org.uk/flumazenil.html A pilot study of the effects of flumazenil on symptoms persisting after benzodiazepine withdrawal]</ref>
Some "Withdrawal Symptoms" can emerge despite a constant dosage with the body needing extra dosage in order to feel normal. This is sometimes associated with dosage escalation.

Lormetazepam has a short to intermediate [[biological half-life|half-life]] of approximately 10–12 hours. Shorter acting benzodiazepine compounds are generally associated with a more intense and immediate withdrawal reaction compared to longer acting benzodiazepines. For this reason it is generally recommended to cross from lormetazepam to an equivalent dose of [[diazepam]] to gradually taper the dosage.<ref>(Roche Products (UK) Ltd 1990) [http://www.benzo.org.uk/roche1.htm Benzodiazepines and Your Patients: A Management Programme]</ref>

Lormetazepam and other benzodiazepine drugs act as positive modulators at the [[GABA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> benzodiazepine receptor complex]]. Lormetazepam binds to the benzodiazepine receptor which in turn enhances the effect of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor producing its therapeutic effects as well as adverse effects. When lormetazepam binds to the benzodiazepine receptor sites in sufficient quantities it produces sedation which is used clinically as a therapeutic treatment for insomnia. Lormetazepam alters the brain electrical activity which has been studied via EEG readings.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Kurowski M |author2=Ott H |author3=Herrmann WM. |title= Relationship between EEG dynamics and pharmacokinetics of the benzodiazepine lormetazepam |journal= Pharmacopsychiatria. |volume= 15 |issue= 3 |pages= 77–83 |year= 1982 |pmid=6124982 |doi= 10.1055/s-2007-1019513}}</ref> Lormetazepam appears to be more selective in the type of benzodiazepine receptor it binds to showing a higher affinity for the omega 1 receptor which is responsible for sedation.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=1687574 |url= |format= |date=Nov 1991 |title=Interaction of the hypnotic lormetazepam with central benzodiazepine receptor subtypes omega 1, omega 2 and omega 3 |volume=98 |issue=5 |pages=399–408 |issn=0015-5691 |journal=Nippon Yakurigaku Zasshi |doi=10.1254/fpj.98.5_399 |author1=Ozawa, M |author2=Nakada, Y |author3=Sugimachi, K |author4=Akai, T |author5=Yamaguchi, M}}</ref> Changes in EEG can therefore be used to measure the sedative sleep promoting properties of lormetazepam.
