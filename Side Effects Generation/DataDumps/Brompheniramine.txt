'''Brompheniramine''' ('''Bromfed''', '''Dimetapp''', '''Bromfenex''', '''Dimetane''', '''BPN''', '''Lodrane'''), commonly marketed as its salt '''brompheniramine [[maleate]]''', is an [[antihistamine]] drug of the [[propylamine]] (alkylamine) class. It is readily available [[Over-the-counter drug|over the counter]] and is indicated for the treatment of the symptoms of the [[common cold]] and [[allergic rhinitis]], such as runny nose, itchy eyes, watery eyes, and sneezing. It is a first-generation antihistamine.

Brompheniramine is part of a series of antihistamines including [[pheniramine]] (Naphcon) and its halogenated derivatives and others including [[fluorpheniramine]], [[chlorpheniramine]], [[dexchlorpheniramine]] (Polaramine), [[triprolidine]] (Actifed), and iodopheniramine.

The halogenated alkylamine antihistamines all exhibit [[optical isomerism]] and brompheniramine products contain racemic brompheniramine maleate whereas [[dexbrompheniramine]] (Drixoral) is the dextrorotary (right-handed) stereoisomer.

Brompheniramine has [[antidepressant]] properties, inhibiting [[reuptake]] of the [[neurotransmitter]] [[serotonin]] and [[norepinephrine]]. Based on this knowledge, [[Arvid Carlsson]]
and his colleagues, working at the [[Sweden|Swedish]] company [[AstraZeneca|Astra AB]], were able to derive the first marketed [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]], [[zimelidine]], from brompheniramine.<ref name="Barondes">{{cite book

Like other agents of this type, brompheniramine also has analgesic-sparing (potentiating) effects on opioid analgesics, commonly reducing codeine, dihydrocodeine, and hydrocodone requirements by 10 to 35 percent.

==Pharmacology==
Brompheniramine works by acting as an [[competitive inhibition|antagonist]] of [[histamine H1 receptor|histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptor]]s. It also functions as a moderately effective [[anticholinergic]] agent, and is likely an [[antimuscarinic]] agent similar to other common antihistamines such as [[diphenhydramine]].

Brompheniramine is metabolised by [[cytochrome P450]]s.

The halogenated alkylamine antihistamines all exhibit optic isomerism and brompheniramine products contain racaemic brompheniramine maleate whereas [[dexbrompheniramine]] (Drixoral) is the dextrorotary (right-handed) stereoisomer.

==Side effects==
Brompheniramine's effects on the cholinergic system may include side-effects such as drowsiness, sedation, dry mouth, dry throat, blurred vision, and increased heart rate.  It is listed as one of the drugs of highest anticholinergic activity in a study of anticholinergenic burden, including long-term cognitive impairment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Salahudeen MJ|last2=Duffull SB|last3=Nishtala PS|date=2015-03-25|title=Anticholinergic burden quantified by anticholinergic risk scales and adverse outcomes in older people: a systematic review|url=http://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-015-0029-9|journal=BMC Geriatrics|volume=15|issue=31|pmc=4377853|pmid=25879993|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1186/s12877-015-0029-9}}</ref>

==Chemistry==
Brompheniramine is an [[structural analog|analog]] of [[chlorpheniramine]]. The only difference is that the chlorine atom in the benzene ring is replaced with a bromine atom. It is also synthesized in an analogous manner.<ref>L.A. Walter, {{US Patent|3061517}} (1962)</ref><ref>L.A. Walter, {{US Patent|3030371}} (1962)</ref>
