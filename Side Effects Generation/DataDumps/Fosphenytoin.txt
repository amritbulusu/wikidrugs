'''Fosphenytoin''' (fosphenytoin sodium, trade names '''Cerebyx''', [[Parke-Davis]]; '''Prodilantin''', [[Pfizer|Pfizer Holding France]]<ref name=French_trade_name>{{cite web | url=http://www.vidal.fr/Medicament/prodilantin-13783.htm | title=PRODILANTIN 75 mg/ml sol inj IM et p perf IV | work=VIDAL, l'information de référence sur les produits de santé | accessdate=23 October 2005 }}</ref>) is a water-soluble [[phenytoin]] [[prodrug]] that is administered intravenously to deliver phenytoin, potentially more safely than intravenous phenytoin. It is most commonly used in the acute treatment convulsive [[status epilepticus]].

<!-- History, society, and culture -->
Fosphenytoin was developed in 1996.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pitkänen|first1=Asla|last2=Schwartzkroin|first2=Philip A.|last3=Moshé|first3=Solomon L.|title=Models of Seizures and Epilepsy.|date=2005|publisher=Elsevier|location=Burlington|isbn=9780080457024|page=539|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qw6KqLjwtZQC&pg=PA539}}</ref> On 18 November 2004, Sicor (a subsidiary of [[Teva Pharmaceutical Industries|Teva]]) received a tentative approval letter from the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]] for a generic version of fosphenytoin.<ref name=generic>{{cite web | url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.Label_ApprovalHistory#apphist | title=Fosphenytoin Sodium Approval History | accessdate=20 October 2005 }}</ref>

== Medical uses ==
Fosphenytoin is approved in the United States for the short term (five days or fewer) treatment of epilepsy when more widely used means of phenytoin administration are not possible or are ill-advised,<ref name=approved_use>{{cite web|author=Parke-Davis |year=2001 |title=Cerebyx: Fosphenytoin Sodium Injection - Labeling Revision |work=Cerebyx Approval History |publisher=Warner-Lambert Company |url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2001/20450s4s5lbl.pdf |accessdate=20 October 2005 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031017163732/http://www.fda.gov/CDER/foi/label/2001/20450s4s5lbl.pdf |archivedate=October 17, 2003 }}</ref> such as [[endotracheal intubation]], [[status epilepticus]] or some other type of repeated seizures; vomiting, and/or the patient is unalert or not awake or both.<ref name=when_to_use_fosphenytoin>{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnson J, Wrenn K | title=Inappropriate fosphenytoin use in the ED | journal=American Journal of Emergency Medicine | volume=19 | issue=4 | year=2001 | pages=293–4 | pmid=11447516 | doi=10.1053/ajem.2001.24471}} [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&list_uids=11447516&dopt=ExternalLink Fulltext options] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&list_uids=11447516&dopt=ExternalLink&ExternalLink=libs List of Library Holdings Worldwide]</ref>

=== Other ===
In 2003, it was reported that even though [[anticonvulsant]]s are often very effective in [[mania]], and acute mania requires rapid treatment, fosphenytoin had no antimanic effect.<ref name=not_an_antimanic>{{cite journal | doi=10.4088/JCP.v64n0408 |vauthors=Applebaum J, Levine J, Belmaker RH | title=Intravenous fosphenytoin in acute mania | journal=Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume=64 | issue=4 | year=2003 | pages=408–9 | pmid=12716241 | url=http://www.psychiatrist.com/privatepdf/2003/v64n04/v64n0408.pdf | format=PDF}}</ref>

== Metabolism ==
One [[milli]][[mole (unit)|mole]] of phenytoin is produced for every millimole of fosphenytoin administered; the [[hydrolysis]] of fosphenytoin also yields [[phosphate]] and [[formaldehyde]], the latter of which is subsequently metabolized to [[formate]], which is in turn metabolized by a folate dependent mechanism.<ref name=approved_use />

== Side effects ==
Side effects are similar to intravenous phenytoin and include hypotension, cardiac [[arrhythmias]], CNS adverse events ([[nystagmus]], dizziness, sedation/somnolence, [[ataxia]] and [[stupor]]), and local dermatological reactions. [[Purple glove syndrome]] probably occurs with fosphenytoin but possibly at lower frequency than with intravenous phenytoin. Fosphenytoin can cause [[hyperphosphatemia]] in end-stage [[renal failure]] patients.<ref name=not_in_kidney_failure>{{cite journal |vauthors=McBryde KD, Wilcox J, Kher KK | title=Hyperphosphatemia due to fosphenytoin in a pediatric ESRD patient | journal=Pediatric Nephrology (Berlin, Germany) | volume=20 | issue=8 | year=2005 | pages=1182–5 | pmid=15965770 | format = PDF | doi=10.1007/s00467-005-1947-0}}</ref>

==History==
Phenytoin, in both its acidic and sodium salt forms, is erratically bioavailable whether it is injected or taken orally due to its high [[melting point]], weak [[acidity]], and its being only sparingly [[solubility|soluble]] in water.<ref name=erratic>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yamaoka Y, Roberts RD, Stella VJ |title=Low-melting phenytoin prodrugs as alternative oral delivery modes for phenytoin: a model for other high-melting sparingly water-soluble drugs |journal=J Pharm Sci |volume=72 |issue=4 |pages=400–5 |date=April 1983 |pmid=6864479 |doi=10.1002/jps.2600720420 }}</ref> Simply putting patients on other drugs is not always an option; this was especially true before 1993, when the number of [[anticonvulsant]]s available was much more limited.<ref name=pre-1993>[http://neuroland.com/sz/anticon/before_93.htm Anticonvulsants before 1993] Neuroland</ref> One solution was to develop a prodrug that did not have these drawbacks.

Fosphenytoin was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) on August 5, 1996 for use in epilepsy.<ref name=approval>{{cite web | url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.Label_ApprovalHistory | title=Cerebyx Approval History | accessdate=20 October 2005 }}</ref>
