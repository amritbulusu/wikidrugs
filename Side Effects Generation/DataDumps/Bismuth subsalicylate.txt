'''Bismuth subsalicylate,''' sold under the brand name '''Pepto-Bismol''', is an [[antacid]] medication used to treat temporary discomforts of the [[stomach]] and [[gastrointestinal tract]], such as [[diarrhea]], [[indigestion]], [[heartburn]] and [[nausea]]. It is also commonly known as ''pink bismuth''.

Bismuth subsalicylate has the empirical chemical formula of C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>5</sub>BiO<sub>4</sub>,<ref>''[[Merck Index]]'', 11th Edition, '''1299'''</ref> and it is a [[colloid]]al substance obtained by hydrolysis of [[bismuth]] [[salicylate]] (Bi(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(OH)CO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>). The actual structure{{clarify|reason=of which substance? bismuth subsalicylate or bismuth salicylate or both?|date=May 2017}} is unknown and the formulation is only approximate.

Children should not take medication with bismuth subsalicylate while recovering from [[influenza]] or [[chicken pox]], as epidemiologic evidence points to an association between the use of [[salicylate]]-containing medications during certain viral infections and the onset of [[Reye's syndrome]].<ref>[http://www.reyessyndrome.org/pdfs/medicationscontainingaspirin.pdf Aspirin or Salicylate-Containing Medications], reyessyndrome.org</ref> For the same reason, it is typically recommended that nursing mothers not use medication containing bismuth subsalicylate because small amounts of the medication are excreted in human breast milk, and these pose a theoretical risk of Reye's syndrome to nursing children.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/disease/food_illness.htm|title=Food-borne and Waterborne Illness   - Breastfeeding – CDC|work=cdc.gov}}</ref>

Salicylates are very toxic to cats, and thus bismuth subsalicylate should not be administered to cats.<ref>''Cat Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook'', Carlson and Giffin, page 390</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==
Bismuth subsalicylate is used as an antacid and [[diarrhea|antidiarrheal]], and to treat some other gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea. The means by which this occurs is still not well documented. It is thought to be some combination of the following:<ref name="drugbank">[http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01294 Bismuth subsalicylate], DrugBank</ref>
* Retarding the expulsion of fluids into the digestive system by irritated tissues, by "coating" them.
* Stimulation of absorption of fluids and electrolytes by the intestinal wall (antisecretory action)
* As a [[salicylate]], reducing inflammation/irritation of stomach and intestinal lining through inhibition of prostaglandin G/H synthase 1/2
* Reduction in hypermotility of the stomach
* Binding of toxins produced by ''Escherichia coli''
* Bactericidal action of a number of its subcomponents, including salicylic acid<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal | pmid = 2694949 | volume=33 | issue=12 | title=Binding and killing of bacteria by bismuth subsalicylate | pmc=172824 |date=December 1989 | journal=Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. | pages=207582 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.33.12.2075 | last1 = Sox | first1 = TE | last2 = Olson | first2 = CA}}</ref>
* Bactericidal action via a so-called [[oligodynamic effect]] in which small amounts of heavy metals such as bismuth are toxic for a number of microbes
* Weak antacid properties

''[[In vitro]]'' and ''[[in vivo]]'' data have shown that bismuth subsalicylate hydrolyzes in the gut to [[bismuth oxychloride]] and [[salicylic acid]] and less commonly [[bismuth hydroxide]]. In the stomach, this is likely an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. The salicylic acid is absorbed and therapeutical concentrations of salicylic acid can be found in blood after bismuth subsalicylate administration. Bismuth oxychloride and bismuth hydroxide are both believed to have bactericidal effects, as is salicylic acid for [[enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli|enterotoxigenic ''E. coli'']] a common cause of "[[traveler's diarrhea]]."<ref name="ReferenceA" />

Organobismuth compounds have historically been used in growth media for selective isolation of microorganisms. Such salts have been shown to inhibit proliferation of ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'', other enteric bacteria, and some fungi.<ref name="ASM">{{cite journal | url = http://aem.asm.org/content/71/2/876.full | doi = 10.1128/AEM.71.2.876-882.2005 | title = Metabolism of Bismuth Subsalicylate and Intracellular Accumulation of Bismuth by Fusarium sp.

== History ==
[[File:1957 Pepto Bismol ad.jpg|thumbnail|1957 Life Magazine ad for the product]]
While bismuth salts were in use in Europe by the late 1700s, the combination of bismuth subsalicylate and zinc salts for astringency with [[salol]] (phenyl salicilate) appears to have begun in the US in the early 1900s as a remedy for life-threatening diarrhea in infants with [[cholera]]. At first sold directly to physicians, it was first marketed as ''Bismosal'' in 1918.<ref name="RID1">{{cite journal|last1=Ws. Bierer|first1=Dr. Douglas|title=Bismuth Subsalicylate: History, Chemistry, and Safety|journal=Reviews of Infectious Diseases|date=January–February 1990|volume=12|issue=Supplement 1|page=S3|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4455445?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|accessdate=21 December 2016|doi=10.1093/clinids/12.supplement_1.s3}}</ref>

Pepto-Bismol began being sold in 1900<ref name="RID1" /> or 1901<ref>{{cite web|last1=Menegas, M.D.|first1=Jeff|title=How was Pepto Bismol invented?|url=https://www.quora.com/How-was-Pepto-Bismol-invented|website=Quora|publisher=Quora, Inc.|accessdate=21 December 2016}}</ref> by a doctor in New York. It was originally sold as a remedy for infant diarrhea by [[Norwich Pharmacal Company]] under the name "Bismosal: Mixture Cholera Infantum".<ref name="RID1" /> It was renamed Pepto-Bismol in 1919. Norwich Eaton Pharmaceuticals was acquired by Procter and Gamble in 1982.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZyUwNAs43LcC&pg=PA424 | title=Rising Tide: Lessons from 165 Years of Brand Building at Procter and Gamble | publisher=Harvard Business Press | date=May 1, 2004 | accessdate=2013-05-07 | author=Davis, Dyer | pages=424|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

As of 1946, Canadian advertisements placed by Norwich show the product as Pepto-Besmol both in graphic and text.<ref>{{cite news|title="Simple Diarrhoea" ad|work=Toronto Daily Star|date=16 August 1946|page=33}}</ref>

Pepto-Bismol is an [[over-the-counter drug]] currently produced by the [[Procter & Gamble]] company in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. Pepto-Bismol is made in chewable tablets<ref>The trademark was extended to cover the tablets in 1973.
