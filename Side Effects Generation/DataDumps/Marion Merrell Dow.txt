'''Marion Merrell Dow''' and its predecessor '''Marion Laboratories''' was a [[United States|U.S.]] pharmaceutical company based in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] from 1950 until 1996.

The company specialized in bringing to market drugs that had been discovered but unmarketed by other companies including [[Cardizem]] which treats arrhythmias and high blood pressure, [[Carafate]] (an [[Peptic ulcer|ulcer]] treatment), [[Gaviscon]] (an [[antacid]]), [[Seldane]] (a withdrawn [[Histamine antagonist|antihistamine]]), [[Nicorette]] (anti-smoking gum) and [[Cepacol]] mouthwash.<ref name="IDCH">[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Marion-Merrell-Dow-Inc-Company-History.html Marion Merrell Dow, Inc.,  International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 9. St. James Press, 1994] (reprinted on fundinguniverse.com)</ref>

The company operating out of its headquarters at 9300 Ward Parkway was a springboard for its founder [[Ewing Marion Kauffman]] to start the [[Kansas City Royals]] baseball team.

[[File:Marion-labs1.jpg|thumb|300px|Marion's office space in Kansas City was taken over in 2006 by [[Cerner]] Corporation]]

===Richardson-Merrell===
The company traces its roots back to 1828 when William S. Merrell opened the Western Market Drug Store at Sixth Street and Western Row (now Central Avenue) in downtown [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].  Merrell expanded into the wholesale drug business.  Following his death in 1880 his sons formed the William S. Merrell Chemical Company.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=3IJtVP9WnXEC&pg=RA1-PA80&dq=%22William+Merrell%22+Chemical&sig=ACfU3U2PSoTylML1X7tBGsYSknZDnHnNcQ This Day in Ohio History by Rebecca Goodman and Barrett J. Brunsman - Emmis Books - 2004] {{ISBN|1-57860-191-6}}</ref>

In the 1930s, it merged with a company started by [[Lunsford Richardson]] to become Richardson-Merrell.  Richardson's most notable product was [[Vicks]] VapoRub (named in honor of his brother-in-law Dr. Joshua Vick, a [[Selma, North Carolina]] physician.

In 1958, Richardson-Merrell acquired the English company [[Milton Antiseptic|Milton Antiseptic Ltd]].<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KUdvcDD1UboC&pg=PA161&dq=1958+%22Milton+Antiseptic%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=inVWUvKlHonBswaguYDIAQ&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=1958%20%22Milton%20Antiseptic%22&f=false Michigan Business Reports, Issue 57]: p. 161</ref>

A team at [[William S. Merrell Chemical Company]] led by Frank Palopoli synthesized clomifene in 1956; after its biological activity was confirmed a patent was filed and issued in November 1959.<ref name=Hist>{{cite journal|last1=Dickey|first1=RP|last2=Holtkamp|first2=DE|title=Development, pharmacology and clinical experience with clomiphene citrate.|journal=Human Reproduction Update|date=1996|volume=2|issue=6|pages=483–506|pmid=9111183|url=http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/content/2/6/483.full.pdf|doi=10.1093/humupd/2.6.483}}</ref><ref>Allen, R.E., Palopoli, F.P., Schumann, E.L. and Van Campen, M.G.

====Thalidomide====
One of Richardson-Merrell's best-known incidents revolved around its efforts to introduce [[thalidomide]] into the US market in the 1950s and 1960s under the brand name "Kevadon". The drug was already highly popular in Europe as a [[sedative]] and [[antiemetic]] for elderly patients. Although neither tested nor approved for use during pregnancy, its effectiveness and absence of significant side-effects led many physicians to prescribe it to pregnant women.  Richardson-Merrell submitted their [[new drug application]] (NDA) to the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] in June, 1960. During the application process, Richardson-Merrell asked the FDA for quick approval of the drug, and distributed 2.5 million tablets of thalidomide to 1,200 American doctors with the understanding that the drug was under investigation, a preemptive marketing strategy that was permissible at the time under existing regulations.<ref name=FDA>{{cite web |title=About the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research |url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/ucm091393.htm |date=2009-06-18 |work=[[US Food and Drug Administration]] |accessdate=27 July 2009}}</ref> Nearly 20,000 patients received the drug. Reviewing [[pharmacologist]] [[Frances Oldham Kelsey]], who had joined the FDA just a month before the application's arrival, repeatedly denied the company's requests for permission to market the drug, citing an insufficient number of controlled studies to establish risks.<ref>{{cite web |author=Bren, Linda |title=Frances Oldham Kelsey: FDA Medical Reviewer Leaves Her Mark on History |url=http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2001/201_kelsey.html  |date=March–April 2001 |work=[[US Food and Drug Administration]] |accessdate=27 July 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080113102840/http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2001/201_kelsey.html |archivedate = 13 January 2008}}</ref> When studies revealed that 10,000 children worldwide had been born with severe birth defects from the drug, Merrell withdrew its application and recalled the remaining unconsumed tablets from doctors offices around the country. Ultimately, 17 children in the United States were born with defects. For correctly denying the application despite the pressure from Richardson-Merrell, Kelsey eventually received the President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service at a 1962 ceremony with President [[John F. Kennedy]].<ref>[http://www.medic8.com/medicines/Thalidomide.html Thalidomide - medic8.com - Retrieved August 25, 2008]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals===
[[Dow Chemical]] acquired controlling interest of the Merrell pharmaceutical division of Richardson-Merrell company in 1980 and it became Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals.<ref name="Los Angeles Times">{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Patrick|title=Dow Chemical to Get Control of Marion Labs :  $5-Billion-Plus Deal Is an Effort to Diversify|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-07-18/business/fi-4000_1_merrell-dow|work=Los Angeles Times|date=18 July 1989}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Times|first1=Winston Williams, Special To The New York|title=Dow Broadens Product Lines|journal=The New York Times|date=11 February 1981|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/11/business/dow-broadens-product-lines.html|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

The former Richardson Merrell became [[Vicks|Richardson Vicks]]. In 1985, Richardson Vicks was acquired by [[Procter & Gamble]].

====U.S. Supreme Court Cases====
In the U.S., Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals was a named party in at least two major [[United States Supreme Court]] cases:
* [[Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Thompson|''Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc.'' v. ''Thompson'']], 478 U.S. 804 (1986), involving original jurisdiction
* [[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals|''Daubert'' v. ''Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals'']] 509 U.S. 579 (1993), applied the rules governing [[expert testimony]] established by the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] to the admission of scientific evidence at trials conducted in federal courts

===Marion Merrell Dow===
In 1989 Dow Chemical acquired 67 percent interest of Marion Laboratories, which was renamed Marion Merrell Dow.  Among the products Merrell Dow brought that would be shortly marketed were [[Seldane]], Lorelco, Nicorette and Cepacol.  The merger was considered a good fit because of Marion Laboratories strong sales force and Merrell Dow's strong research and development capabilities.<ref name="IDCH"/><ref name="Los Angeles Times"/>

At the time Marion Laboratories was outperforming all other drug company stocks by 2½ times.<ref name="St. Petersburg Times">{{cite news |title= Marion Laboratories predicted to outperform all drug stocks |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/51699233.html?dids=51699233:51699233&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Aug+22%2C+1986&author=Dick+Davis&pub=St.+Petersburg+Times&desc=Marion+Laboratories+predicted+to+outperform+all+drug+stocks&pqatl=google|access-date=June 18, 2009 |work=[[St. Petersburg Times]] | date=August 22, 1986 | first=Dick | last=Davis}}</ref>
Marion had the highest sales and the highest profit per employee of any company traded on the New York Stock Exchange.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Dow's initial offer was $38 a share in cash, or $2.2 billion, for the 39 percent of Marion's 150 million shares with an option to raise the stake to 67 percent by 1992. The offer made 300 of Marion's employees millionaires.  The deal created the fifth largest drug company in the United States in terms of sales.

Although controlled by Dow the new company continued to trade on Marion Laboratories' old [[New York Stock Exchange]]  [[ticker symbol]] "MKC."

====Marion Laboratories====
[[Ewing Kauffman]], a former pharmaceutical salesman in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] started the company in 1950 in the basement of his Kansas City home by selling calcium supplements made from crushed [[oyster]] shells which he made in his home and starting with $5,000 in capital.  Kauffman would say later he used his middle name for the company to avoid the impression that it was a one-person operation.<ref name="IDCH"/>

The company quickly took off.  As Kauffman expanded he offered his employees [[share options]] and [[profit sharing]].

Rather than researching products, the company adopted a policy of buying products discovered by other companies and reformulating them for market.

In 1964 it formally incorporated as Marion Laboratories, Inc.

In the 1980s it marketed [[Silvadene]] (a burn cream), [[Ditropan]] (treatment for [[bladder]] spasms),  [[Nitro-Bid]] ([[chest pain]] treatment), [[Antimicrobial Removal Device|ARD]] and [[Bac-T-Screen]] (helped identify bacteria), [[Culturette]] (used to identify Group A [[streptococci]]) and ToxiLab, a drug detection system used to detect [[drug abuse]].<ref name="IDCH"/>

===Hoechst Marion Roussel===
In 1995 [[Hoechst AG]] of Germany announced plans to buy Dow's increased 71 percent share for $25.75 a share or $7.1 Billion. Hoechst also bought the other outstanding shares.  The deal created the [[List of pharmaceutical companies|world's second largest drug manufacturer]] at the time (behind [[Glaxo Wellcome]] and ahead of [[Merck & Company]]).<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3653/is_199505/ai_n8732298 Hoechst agrees to acquire Marion Merrell Dow - Corporate Growth Weekly - May 15, 1995]</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Hoechst AG to Buy Marion Merrell Dow / Acquisition worth over $7 billion|url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Hoechst-AG-to-Buy-Marion-Merrell-Dow-3035234.php|work=San Francisco Chronicle|agency=Reuters|date=May 5, 1995}}</ref>

Hoechst's new pharmaceutical company became [[Hoechst Marion Roussel]] and kept its North American headquarters in Kansas City.

=== Sanofi ===
Hoechst in turn later became part of the pharmaceutical and lab [[assay]] testing company [[Aventis]] in 1999,<ref name=Bris>Arturo Bris and Christos Cabolis,

Sanofi has sold off the original Marion Labs Kansas City plant at 10236 Marion Park Drive with [[Cerner Corporation]] buying the offices in 2006.<ref name="emporis_building_info">{{cite web | url=http://www.emporis.com/building/cerner-corporation-south-campus-bldg-i-kansas-city-mo-usa | title=Cerner Corporation-South Campus, Bldg #I | publisher=Emporis GMBH | accessdate=5 October 2014 | quote=These are the names and the order of the ownership since Ewing Kauffman's business interests were dispersed following his death: Marion Laboratories became Marion Merrill Dow, which was sold to Hoechst Marion Roussel and finally, the present arrangement.

Aventis will abandon the campus by the end of 2006, following its worldwide reorganization.}}</ref>  In August 2009 the company announced its plans to close the remaining facility altogether.<ref name="sanofi_plant_close">{{cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/382/story/1411624.html |title=Sanofi-Aventis to close plant, eliminate 370 jobs |publisher=The Kansas City Star |work=KansasCity.com |date=28 August 2009 |accessdate=5 October 2014 |author=Collison, Kevin |quote=Sanofi-Aventis is closing its Kansas City manufacturing plant after failing to find a satisfactory buyer for the operation, which employs 370 people.  The decision to shutter the 33-year-old plant, which manufactures solid-dose oral medications including Allegra, marks the end of an era. It was the last to have been operated by Marion Laboratories, the pharmaceutical empire established by Ewing Kauffman.  Aventis, later Sanofi-Aventis, has owned it since 2000.  “There were a number of criteria involved in deciding to close, but ultimately, it was a lack of growth in demand for the products made in Kansas City,” said Jack Cox, a spokesman for the French firm. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901174913/http://www.kansascity.com/382/story/1411624.html |archivedate=September 1, 2009 }}</ref>
