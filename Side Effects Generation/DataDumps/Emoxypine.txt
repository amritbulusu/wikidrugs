'''Emoxypine''' (2-ethyl-6-methyl-3-hydroxypyridine), also known as '''Mexidol''' or '''Mexifin''' when used as the [[succinate]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]], is an antioxidant manufactured in Russia by Pharmasoft Pharmaceuticals.<ref>[http://www.mexidol.ru/en mexidol.ru, Pharmasoft Website]</ref> Its chemical structure resembles that of [[pyridoxine]] (a type of [[vitamin B6|vitamin B<sub>6</sub>]]).  It is not approved for any medical use in the United States or Europe.

==History==
Emoxypine was first synthesized by L.D. Smirnov and K.M. Dumayev, then studied and developed in the Institute of Pharmacology, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences and National Scientific Center of Bioactive Substances Safety.<ref name=item102573>Institute of Pharmacology, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, Moscow, Russia http://www.mexidol.ru/en/pro/library/farmacology/item102573</ref>

==Use==
In Russia, emoxypine has a wide range of applications in medical practice. It purportedly exercises [[anxiolytic]],<ref>{{cite journal|title=Comparative Analysis of the Anxiolytic Effects of 3-Hydroxypyridine and Succinic Acid Derivatives |author=I. A.

==Mechanism of action==
Emoxypine's [[mechanism of action]] is believed to be its antioxidant and membrane-protective effects with the following key components:<ref name=item102573/><ref>Dumayev K.M., Voronina T.A., Smirnov L.D. antioxidants in the prophylaxis and therapy of CNS pathologies. Moscow, 1995</ref>{{medcn|date=March 2013}}

* Emoxypine effectively inhibits [[free radical]] oxidation of biomembrane lipids, reacts to peroxide radicals of lipids primary and hydroxyl radical of peptides
* Increases the activity of [[antioxidant]] enzymes, specifically that of [[superoxide dismutase]], responsible for the formation and consumption of [[lipid peroxidation|lipid peroxides]] and active oxygen forms
* Inhibits free radicals during the synthesis of [[prostaglandin]] catalyzed [[cyclooxygenase]] and [[lipoxygenase]], increases the correlation [[prostacyclin]]/ [[thromboxane A2]] and blocks the [[leukotriene]] formation 
* Increases the content of polar fraction of lipids ([[phosphatidyl serine]] and [[phosphatidyl inositol]]) and reduces the cholesterol/[[phospholipid]]s ratio which proves its lipid-regulatory properties; shifts structure transition into the low temperature zones, that is provokes the reduction of  membrane viscosity and the increase of its fluidity, increases lipid-protein ratio.
* Modulates the activity of membrane-bound enzymes: [[phosphodiesterase]], [[cyclic nucleotide]]s, [[adenylate cyclase]], aldoreductase, [[acetylcholinesterase]].
* Modulates the receptor complexes of the brain membranes, i.e. benzodiazepine, [[GABA]], [[acetylcholine]] receptors by increasing their binding ability.
* Stabilizes [[biomembrane]]s, i.e. membrane structures of blood cells - [[erythrocyte]]s and thrombocytes during their haemolysis or mechanical injury accompanied by the formation of free radicals.
* Changes the monoamine level and increases the [[dopamine]] content in the brain.<ref name=item102573/>{{medcn|date=March 2013}}

==Clinical study==
One study determined the effectiveness of emoxypine in 205 patients with clinical manifestations of [[lumbosacral radiculopathy]] (LSR). Patients were divided into two groups, and further were divided into subgroups depending on the presence of motor disturbances. All patients received a course of conventional medical treatment and physiotherapy; main group additionally received emoxypine. Thereafter, clinical-neurological control of long-term results of treatment in subgroups of patients was performed. The results showed that the use of emoxypine in the combined therapy of patients with LSR led to significant and persistent reduction of severity of pain syndrome and rapid recovery of function of spinal roots and [[peripheral nerve]]s compared with conventional therapy.<ref name=item102573/><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 17117675 | year = 2006 | last1 = Likhacheva | first1 = EB | last2 = Sholomov | first2 = II | title = Clinical and immunological assessment of efficacy of mexidol in the treatment of lumbosacral radiculopathy | volume = 106 | issue = 10 | pages = 52–7 | journal = Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.
