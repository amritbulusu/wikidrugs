'''Tetracyclic antidepressants''' ('''TeCAs''') are a class of [[antidepressant]]s that were first introduced starting in the 1970s. They are named after their [[tetracyclic]] [[chemical structure]], containing four [[cyclic compound|rings of atoms]], and are closely related to the [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s (TCAs), which contain three rings of atoms.

==List of TeCAs==

===Marketed===
* [[Maprotiline]] (Ludiomil) – can also be classified as a TCA and grouped with the [[secondary amine]]s
* [[Mianserin]] (Tolvon)
* [[Mirtazapine]] (Remeron)
* [[Setiptiline]] (Tecipul)

Drugs that contain four rings not all fused together but are sometimes still classified as TeCAs include:

* [[Amoxapine]] (Asendin) – often classified as a TCA and grouped with the secondary amines

====Miscellaneous====
* [[Benzoctamine]] (Tacitin) – a tetracyclic compound and is closely related to maprotiline, with the two compounds differing only in the length of their [[side chain]], but benzoctamine is not used as an antidepressant and is instead used as an [[anxiolytic]]
* [[Loxapine]] (Adasuve, Loxitane) – a [[typical antipsychotic]] that produces amoxapine as a major [[metabolite]] and is said to have antidepressant effects, but it is not usually regarded as a TeCA

Drugs that contain four rings not all fused together but could still be classified as tetracyclic include:

* [[Mazindol]] (Mazanor, Sanorex) – a [[monoamine reuptake inhibitor]] used as an [[appetite suppressant]] and with potential antidepressant effects, but not classified as a TeCA

===Never marketed===
* [[Aptazapine]] (CGS-7525A) – a close [[structural analog|analogue]] of mirtazapine
* [[Esmirtazapine]] (ORG-50,081) – the (''S'')-(+) [[enantiomer]] of mirtazapine
* [[Oxaprotiline]] (C 49-802 BDA) – a close analogue of maprotiline

Drugs that contain four rings not all fused together but could still be classified as tetracyclic include:

* [[Ciclazindol]] (WY-23,409) – a close analogue of mazindol

==Pharmacology==
{{See also|Pharmacology of antidepressants}}

TeCAs have diverse [[pharmacology]] and differ from TCAs in a number of ways. With the exception of amoxapine, TeCAs do not [[reuptake inhibitor|inhibit]] the [[reuptake]] of [[serotonin]]. However, aside from mirtazapine, they do inhibit the reuptake of [[norepinephrine]]. TeCAs block the [[serotonin]] [[5-HT2 receptor|5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor]]s similarly to TCAs. Besides mirtazapine, they also block the [[alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor]]. Conversely, whereas TCAs have relatively low [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for the [[alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor]], mianserin and mirtazapine potently antagonize this receptor, and this action is thought to be involved in their antidepressant effects. TeCAs block the [[histamine]] [[H1 receptor|H<sub>1</sub> receptor]] similarly to the TCAs, but tend to be even stronger [[antihistamine]]s than TCAs. On the other hand, in contrast to almost all TCAs, TeCAs have only low affinity for the [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor]]s, and for this reason, are associated with few or no [[anticholinergic]] [[side effect]]s. Mianserin and mirtazapine are far less [[toxicity|toxic]] than TCAs in [[overdose]].

The TeCAs act as [[receptor antagonist|antagonists]] or [[inverse agonist]]s of the receptors and as [[transporter blocker|inhibitor]]s of the transporters.
