==Medical uses==

===Alzheimer's disease===
There is no evidence that donepezil or other similar agents alters the course or progression of [[Alzheimer's disease]]. 6 to 12-month controlled studies have shown modest benefits in cognition and/or behavior.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal |vauthors=Steele LS, Glazier RH |title=Is donepezil effective for treating Alzheimer's disease? |journal=Can Fam Physician|volume=45 |issue= |pages=917–9|date=April 1999 |pmid=10216789|pmc=2328349}}</ref> The UK [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence|National Institute for Clinical Excellence]] (NICE) recommends donepezil as an option in the management of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.<ref name=NICE2011>https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/TA217/chapter/1-Guidance</ref> The person should, however, be reviewed frequently and if there is no significant benefit it should be stopped.<ref name=NICE2011/> In 2006 the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] also approved donepezil for treatment of mild, moderate and severe [[dementia]] in Alzheimer's disease.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2006/ucm108768.htm FDA Press Release] 2006</ref>

== Adverse effects ==
In clinical trials the most common adverse events leading to discontinuation were [[nausea]], [[diarrhea]], and vomiting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/020690s037,021720s010,022568s007lbl.pdf |title=www.accessdata.fda.gov |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Noetzli M, Eap CB | date = Apr 2013 | title = Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic aspects of drugs used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease | url = | journal = Clin Pharmacokinet | volume = 52 | issue = 4| pages = 225–41 | doi = 10.1007/s40262-013-0038-9 | pmid = 23408070 }}</ref> Other side effects included difficulty sleeping, muscle cramps and anorexia. Most side effects were observed in patients taking the 23&nbsp;mg dose compared to 10&nbsp;mg or lower doses. Side effects improved with continued use.<ref name="ReferenceA" />

===Precautions===
Donepezil should be used with caution in people with [[cardiac disease|heart disease]], cardiac conduction disturbances, [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[asthma]], severe [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s and [[sick sinus syndrome]].<ref name="ReferenceA" />

People with [[Peptic ulcer|peptic ulcer disease]] or taking [[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAIDS]] should use caution because increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding was noted.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> Slow heart beat and fainting in people with heart problems were also seen. These symptoms may appear more frequent when initiating treatment or increasing the donepezil dose. Although occurrence of seizures is rare, people who have a predisposition to seizures should be treated with caution.<ref name="ReferenceA">Aricept (donepezil hydrochloride) package insert. Woodcliff Lake, NJ: Eisai Co., Ltd.; 2010 Nov.</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==
Donepezil binds and reversibly inactivates the cholinesterases, thus inhibiting hydrolysis of acetylcholine. This results in an increased acetylcholine concentrations at cholinergic synapses.

The precise mechanism of action of donepezil in patients with Alzheimer's disease is not fully understood. Certainly Alzheimer's disease involves a substantial loss of the elements of the [[cholinergic]] system and it is generally accepted that the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease are related to this cholinergic deficit, particularly in the [[cerebral cortex]] and other areas of the brain.<ref name="pmid63862">{{cite journal |vauthors=Davies P, Maloney AJ |title=Selective loss of central cholinergic neurons in Alzheimer's disease |journal=Lancet |volume=2 |issue=8000 |pages=1403 |date= December 1976 |pmid=63862 |doi= 10.1016/s0140-6736(76)91936-x|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(76)91936-X |accessdate=2014-12-23}}</ref><ref name="pmid9316159">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kása P, Rakonczay Z, Gulya K |title=The cholinergic system in Alzheimer's disease |journal=Prog.

Just the severity of the loss of cholinergic neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) has been found to correlate with the severity of cognitive impairment.

In addition to its actions as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, donepezil has been found to act as a potent [[agonist]] of the [[sigma-1 receptor|σ<sub>1</sub> receptor]] (K<sub>i</sub> = 14.6 nM), and has been shown to produce specific [[nootropic|antiamnestic]] effects in animals mainly via this action.<ref name="MauriceSu2009">{{cite journal|last1=Maurice|first1=Tangui|last2=Su|first2=Tsung-Ping|title=The pharmacology of sigma-1 receptors|journal=Pharmacology & Therapeutics|volume=124|issue=2|year=2009|pages=195–206|issn=0163-7258|doi=10.1016/j.pharmthera.2009.07.001}}</ref>

Research leading to the development of donepezil began in 1983 at Eisai, and in 1996, Eisai received [[Approved drug|approval]] from the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (USFDA) for donepezil under the brand ''Aricept'', which it co-marketed with [[Pfizer]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rodrigues Simões |first1=MC |displayauthors=etal |title=Donepezil: an important prototype to the design of new drug candidates for Alzheimer's disease |journal=Mini Rev Med Chem |date=January 2014 |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=2–19 |pmid=24251806 |doi=10.2174/1389557513666131119201353}}</ref>  The team at Eisai was led by [[Hachiro Sugimoto]]<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shimbun|first1=Yomiuri|title=Developed the magic bullet for Alzheimer's disease after overcoming many difficulties : People : Chuo Online : YOMIURI ONLINE|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/adv/chuo/dy/people/20100819.html|accessdate=11 January 2017|work=Japan News|format=Chuo University Gakuin Jihou, Issue 464}}</ref>
