[[File:Sulfacetamide substance photo.jpg|thumb|Pure Sulfacetamide sodium salt is a white or slightly yellow crystalline powder]]
'''Sulfacetamide''' is a [[sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]] [[antibiotic]].

==Uses==
Sulfacetamide 10% topical lotion, sold under the brand name Klaron or Ovace, is approved for the treatment of [[acne]] and [[seborrheic dermatitis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/mtm/klaron.html|title=Klaron medical facts from Drugs.com|publisher=}}</ref> When combined with [[sulfur]], it is sold under the brand names [[Plexion]], Clenia, Prascion, and Avar, which contain 10% sulfacetamide and 5% sulfur.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/cdi/avar-cream.html|title=Avar cream: Indications, Side Effects, Warnings - Drugs.com|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/mtm/plexion.html|title=Plexion medical facts from Drugs.com|publisher=}}</ref><ref>http://www.walgreens.com/marketing/library/finddrug/druginfo1.html;jsessionid=PbrFt7xeQx07A7CTF6HcFA**.p_dotcom34?particularDrug=Prascion&id=645494</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/pro/clenia-cream.html|title=Clenia Cream - FDA prescribing information, side effects and uses|publisher=}}</ref>

Sulfacetamide has been investigated for use in the treatment of [[pityriasis versicolor]]<ref name="pmid15224788">{{cite journal |author=Hull CA, Johnson SM |title=A double-blind comparative study of Sulfacetamide lotion 10% versus selenium sulfide lotion 2.5% in the treatment of pityriasis (tinea) versicolor |journal=Cutis |volume=73 |issue=6 |pages=425–9 |date=June 2004 |pmid=15224788 |doi= |url=}}</ref> and [[rosacea]].<ref name="pmid14959943">{{cite journal |author=Del Rosso JQ |title=Evaluating the role of topical therapies in the management of rosacea: focus on combination Sulfacetamide and sulfur formulations |journal=Cutis |volume=73 |issue=1 Suppl |pages=29–33 |date=January 2004 |pmid=14959943 |doi= |url=}}</ref> It also has [[anti-inflammatory]] properties when used to treat [[blepharitis]] or [[conjunctivitis]] (in eye-drop solution). It is believed to work by limiting the presence of folic acid which bacteria need to survive. It has been suggested that sulfacetamide may also serve as a treatment for mild forms of [[hidradenitis suppurativa]].{{citation needed|date=August 2009}} Sulfacetamide has antibacterial activity and is used to control acne. Products containing sulfacetamide and sulfur (a [[keratolytic]]) are commonly promoted for the treatment of acne rosacea (rosacea with papules, pustules, or both).  There are several prescription topical products containing sulfacetamide, such as [[foam]]s, [[shampoo]]s, [[cream (pharmaceutical)|cream]] and [[cleanser|washes]].

Some research indicates that sulfacetamide derivatives may act as antifungals by an [[CYP51A1]]-independent mechanism.<ref name="pmid18475922">{{cite journal |author=Mastrolorenzo A, Supuran CT |title=Antifungal Activity of Ag(I) and Zn(II) Complexes of Sulfacetamide Derivatives |journal=Met Based Drugs |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=49–54 |year=2000 |pmid=18475922 |pmc=2365193 |doi=10.1155/MBD.2000.49}}</ref>

== Structure and chemical properties ==
Sulfacetamide, also known as acetosufamine belongs to the class of organic compounds known as aminobenzenesulfonamides. These are organic compounds containing an benzenesulfonamide moiety with an [[amine]] group attached to the [[benzene]] ring.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|date=2013-09-16|editor-last=DrugBank|title=Sulfacetamide|url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00634|journal=DrugBank}}</ref> The molecular structure is C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>S. It's scientific name is N-(4-aminophenyl)sulfonylacetamide. At room temperature, it appears as a white powder.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/sulfacetamide#section=MS-MS|title=sulfacetamide {{!}} C8H10N2O3S - PubChem|last=Pubchem|website=pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2016-03-09}}</ref>

== Degradation reactions and stability ==
Sulfacetamide is stable under normal temperatures and pressures. No dangerous reactions occur under known conditions of normal use.<ref>Bausch and Lomb. (2015). ''Sulfacetamide Sodium 10% and Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate 0.25% Ophthalmic Solution.''</ref> It is an important [[bacteriostatic agent]] that is commonly used in human and veterinary medicine. Therefore it can accumulate in the environment (mostly surface water).<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Naik|first=P.N.|date=2008|title=Mechanistic study of oxidation of sulfacetamide by diperiodatocuparate(lll)in aquous alkaline medium|url=|journal=Indian journal of chemistry|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>

It has a long lifetime in the environment so different degradation reactions are researched:

The photocatalytic degradation of sulfacetamide in water solutions during illumination of UV radiation with TiO<sub>2</sub> was examined. It was found that sulfacetamide is resistant to [[biodegradation]] and that it is toxic to the green alga ''[[Chlorella|Chlorella vulgaris]]''. It undergoes photocatalytic degradation and the toxicity of the intermediate products is significantly lower than the initial toxicity (figure 1). The intermediates can be mineralized in contrast to sulfacetamide.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Baran|first=Wojciech|last2=Sochacka|first2=Jolanta|last3=Wardas|first3=Władysław|date=2006-11-01|title=Toxicity and biodegradability of sulfonamides and products of their photocatalytic degradation in aqueous solutions|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653506005029|journal=Chemosphere|volume=65|issue=8|pages=1295–1299|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2006.04.040|pmid=16750553}}</ref>

[[Sulfonamide]] → organic intermediate products (degradation) (in presence of OH<sup>−</sup>).<ref name=":3" />
[[File:Sul2.png|thumb|757x757px|Oxidation of sulfacetamide by diperiodatocuperate(lll)]]

At higher temperatures sulfacetamide solutions degrade to its hydrolysed product, [[Sulfanilamide|sulphanilamide]] with a first-order rate constant.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ahmad|first=T.|title=Stability of Suiphacetamide [''sic''] Eye drops at Higher Temperature|journal=Journal of Pakistan Medical Association|url=http://www.jpma.org.pk/full_article_text.php?article_id=6422|date=July 1983}}</ref>

Also oxidation of sulfacetamide by diperiodatocuperate(lll) in aqueous alkaline medium can occur. Copper(lll) is used, as it is involved in many biological electron transfer reactions.<ref name=":2" />

The sulphanilamide can oxidise to a blue product with a first order reaction and it can form [[azo dye]] with a [[second order reaction]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ahmad|first=T.|year=1982|title=Degradation studies on sulphacetamide eye-drops.

== Available forms ==
[[File:Sul4.png|thumb|Structure of sulfacetamide sodium]]
Sulfacetamide as a medicine is available as: solution, eye drops, lotion and a powder.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medicatione.com/?c=drug&s=sulfacetamide&ingredient=sulfacetamide%2520sodium|title=Sulfacetamide (sulfacetamide sodium) drug & pharmaceuticals. Sulfacetamide available forms, doses, prices|website=www.medicatione.com|access-date=2016-03-09}}</ref> It can also be found in the form sulfacetamide sodium, which has a hydrated sodium group bound to it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/fda/fdaDrugXsl.cfm?setid=92f53dc3-cedc-4963-911a-77c3431d4765&type=display|title=SULFACETAMIDE SODIUM OPHTHALMIC SOLUTION USP, 10%|website=dailymed.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2016-03-09}}</ref>

== Mechanisms of action ==
Sulfacetamide is a sulfonamide [[Antibiotics|antibiotic]].<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/s8627?lang=en&region=NL|title=Sulfacetamide ≥98.0% {{!}} Sigma-Aldrich|website=www.sigmaaldrich.com|access-date=2016-03-09}}</ref> Sulfonamides are synthetic bacteriostatic antibiotics, that are active against [[Gram-positive bacteria|gram-positive]] and [[gram-negative bacteria]]. It blocks the synthesis of dihydrofolic acid by inhibiting the enzyme [[dihydropteroate synthase]]. It is a competitive inhibitor of bacterial para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). PABA is required for bacterial synthesis of [[folic acid]] and it is an essential component for bacterial growth.<ref name=":0" /> The multiplication of bacteria is therefore inhibited by the action of sulfacetamide.

== Biotransformation ==
Sulfacetamide is absorped orally. The oral absorption of sulfacetamide is found to be 100%<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=http://www.druginfosys.com/Drug.aspx?drugCode=687&drugName=Sulphacetamide&type=3|title=Sulphacetamide|website=www.druginfosys.com|access-date=2016-03-09}}</ref> and the plasma protein binding is 80–85%. In the liver it is metabolized to inactive metabolites.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url=http://www.robholland.com/Nursing/Drug_Guide/data/monographframes/S039.html|title=SULFACETAMIDE SODIUM|website=www.robholland.com|access-date=2016-03-09}}</ref> Plasma half-life is 7 – 12.8 hours.<ref name=":1" />

Sulfonamides are usually metabolized by several oxidative pathways, acetylation, and conjugation with [[sulfate]] or [[glucuronic acid]].<ref name=":7">{{Cite web|url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/pharmacology/antibacterial_agents/sulfonamides_and_sulfonamide_combinations.html|title=Sulfonamides and Sulfonamide Combinations: Antibacterial Agents: Merck Veterinary Manual|website=www.merckvetmanual.com|access-date=2016-03-09}}</ref> However, there are some differences in [[biotransformation]] between certain species. Acetylation, which reduces the solubility of sulfonamides, is for example poor developed in dogs. The acetylated, hydroxylated, and conjugated forms have little antibacterial activity. Furthermore, the hydroxylated and conjugated forms are less likely to precipitate in urine. The hydrolysis takes place by the action of amidases.<ref>HSU, W.H. (2008). Handbook Of Veterinary Pharmacology. Ames, Iowa: John Wiley & Sons.</ref>

It is excreted primarily in the urine.<ref name=":6" /> Secretory routes of less significance are bile, feces, milk and sweat.<ref name=":7" /> Glomerular filtration, active tubular secretion, and tubular reabsorption are the main processes involved.

== Efficacy ==
Sulfacetamide is a sulfonamide antibiotic, that is used as a cream to treat skin infections and as eye drops to treat eye infections. On the skin it is used to treat acne and [[Seborrhoeic dermatitis|seborrheic dermatitis]].<ref name=":4" /> In cream form it is used to treat bacterial infections on the skin. It can also be used orally to treat [[urinary tract infection]]s.<ref name=":0" /> It kills the bacteria by restricting the production of folic acid, which is essential for bacterial growth.<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/cdi/sulfacetamide-cream.html|title=Sulfacetamide cream: Indications, Side Effects, Warnings - Drugs.com|website=www.drugs.com|access-date=2016-03-09}}</ref> It mainly inhibits the multiplication of bacteria as it acts in a competitive inhibitor.

== Side effects ==
The most common side effects are irritation, stinging or burning of the skin. Other side effects include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, tiredness and headache.<ref name=":0" /> There are however also severe side effects including severe allergic reactions, like (nettle) rash, itch, tightness in chest, difficult breathing and swelling in either the face, mouth, lips or tongue. Other severe side effects include bloody or severe diarrhea, fever, joint pain, red, blistered or swollen skin and stomach pain.<ref name=":8" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.healthline.com/drugs/sulfacetamide/topical-gel#SideEffects2|title=Sulfacetamide: Side Effects, Dosage, Uses|website=www.healthline.com|access-date=2016-03-09}}</ref> In the eye, it can cause [[conjunctivitis]]. There are also life-threatening conditions which can be produced by the antibiotic, like [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome|Stevens Johnson syndrome]] and [[Erythema multiforme]].<ref name=":5" /> Higher exposure can also cause unconsciousness.<ref name=":0" /> Another case showed that sulfacetamide eyedrops caused the life-threatening skin condition [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]] (TEN).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Byrom|first=Lisa|last2=Zappala|first2=Tania|last3=Muir|first3=Jim|date=2013-05-01|title=Toxic epidermal necrolysis caused by over the counter eyedrops|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1440-0960.2012.00936.x/abstract|journal=Australasian Journal of Dermatology|language=en|volume=54|issue=2|pages=144–146|doi=10.1111/j.1440-0960.2012.00936.x|issn=1440-0960}}</ref>  These are however not all side effects. For more information the health care provider can be contacted.

Sulfacetamide should not be used by individuals who have a sensitivity to sulfur or [[sulfa]].

== Toxicity ==
The acute oral toxicity (LD<sub>50</sub>) in a mouse is 16.5 g/kg.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":9">{{cite web|publisher=ScienceLab.com|year=2013|title=Material Safety Data Sheet Sulfacetamide MSDS|url=http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9925121}}</ref> As this falls within Toxicity Category IV of the [[toxicity category rating]] for oral administration, it is practically non-toxic and also not an irritant when taken in orally. However, it is very hazardous in case of skin contact (irritant), ingestion and inhalation.

Research proved that it is more toxic in the presence of light than in the dark. Sulfacetamide is slightly irritant when UV-A light is present. In the presence of light sulfacetamide gets sensitized and degraded which might cause irritation which will lead to toxicity when it is used continuously. In the dark only slight irritation has been shown. Therefore it should be stored in the dark.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sahu|first=Roshan Kumar|last2=Singh|first2=Bhupendra|last3=Saraf|first3=Shubhini A.|last4=Kaithwas|first4=Gaurav|last5=Kishor|first5=Kamal|title=Photochemical toxicity of drugs intended for ocular use|url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/aiht.2014.65.issue-2/10004-1254-65-2014-2461/10004-1254-65-2014-2461.xml|journal=Archives of Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology|volume=65|issue=2|doi=10.2478/10004-1254-65-2014-2461}}</ref>

There are no known carcinogenic and mutagenic effects. It has a moderate toxicity according to the Chemwatch hazard ratings.<ref name=":10">{{cite web|publisher=CHEMWATCH|year=2011|title=Sulfacetamide|url=http://datasheets.scbt.com/sds/AGHS/EN/sc-251080.pdf}}</ref>

== Effects on organisms ==
Sulfonamides are generally against most gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms.<ref name=":1" /> Specifically enteric bacteria and other eubacteria are affected by the antibiotic as it kills the bacteria by restricting the production of folic acid, which is essential for their growth.<ref name=":5" /> However strains of bacteria can be resistant to the antibiotic. If a bacterium is resistant to a sulfonamide, it is resistant to all the forms. Furthermore sulfacetamide is toxic to soil organisms.<ref name=":10" />

==Synthesis==

Sulfacetamide is synthesized either by direct alkylation of [[acetamide]] with 4-aminobenzenesulfonyl chloride, or by reacting  4-aminobenzenesulfonamide with [[acetic anhydride]] and subsequent selective, reductive deacylation of the resultant acetamide using a system of zinc-sodium hydroxide.<ref>{{US patent|2411495}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja01265a107| title = Sulfanilamide Derivatives.
