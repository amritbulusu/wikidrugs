Epoetin beta is marketed under the trade name '''NeoRecormon''', among others.<ref>Amgen - Products. URL: [http://www.amgen.com/patients/prca.html http://www.amgen.com/patients/prca.html]. Accessed 21 October 2007.</ref>

==Chemistry==
Epoetin beta is a [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] form of human erythropoietin which is produced in [[Chinese hamster ovary cell]]s. It has the same protein sequence as natural human erythropoietin, being composed of 165 [[amino acids]] with about 30 KDa [[molecular weight]].<ref name="Medsafe">[[Medsafe]]: [http://medsafe.govt.nz/profs/Datasheet/n/Neorecormoninj.pdf NeoRecormon Datasheet]</ref>

==History==
Erythropoietin (EPO) is a hormone produced in the kidneys. The existence of this hormone has been known since 1906, when scientists first started isolating it, and since the 1980s, a recombinant version of the hormone has been available for use in medical treatment.{{fact|date=February 2017}}
