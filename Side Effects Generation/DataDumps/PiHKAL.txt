'''''PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story''''' is a [[book]] by Dr. [[Alexander Shulgin]] and [[Ann Shulgin]] which was published in 1991. The subject of the work is [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] [[phenethylamine]] [[Derivative (chemistry)|chemical derivatives]], notably those that act as [[psychedelic drug|psychedelics]] and/or [[empathogen-entactogen]]s. The main title is an [[acronym]] that stands for "Phenethylamines I Have Known And Loved".

The book is arranged into two parts, the first part being a fictionalized autobiography of the couple and the second part describing 179
different psychedelic compounds (most of which Shulgin discovered himself), including detailed synthesis instructions, [[bioassay]]s, dosages, and other commentary.

The second part was made freely available by Shulgin on [[Erowid]] while the first part is available only in the printed text. While the reactions described are beyond the ability of people with a basic chemistry education, some tend to emphasize techniques that do not require difficult-to-obtain chemicals. Notable among these are the use of [[Aluminium amalgam|mercury-aluminum amalgam]] (an unusual but easy to obtain [[reagent]]) as a [[reducing agent]] and detailed suggestions on legal plant sources of important drug precursors such as [[safrole]].

== Impact and popularity ==

Through ''PIHKAL'' (and later ''[[TIHKAL]]''), Shulgin sought to ensure that his discoveries would escape the limits of professional research labs and find their way to the public; a goal consistent with his stated beliefs that [[psychedelic drug]]s can be valuable tools for self-exploration. The [[MDMA]] ("ecstasy") synthesis published in ''PIHKAL'' remains one of the most common [[clandestine chemistry|clandestine]] methods of its manufacture to this day. Many countries have banned the major substances for which this book gives directions for synthesis, such as [[2C-B]], [[2C-T-2]], and [[2C-T-7]]. In the United Kingdom, all but [[phenethylamine]] are illegal.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In 1994, two years after ''PIHKAL'' was published, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) raided Shulgin's lab and requested that he turn over his DEA license. Richard Meyer, spokesman for DEA's San Francisco Field Division, has stated in reference to ''PIHKAL'' "It is our opinion that those books are pretty much cookbooks on how to make illegal drugs. Agents tell me that in clandestine labs that they have raided, they have found copies of those books," suggesting that the publication of ''PIHKAL'' and the termination of Shulgin's license may have been related.<ref name="Dr. Ecstasy">{{cite news | author = Drake Bennett | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/30/magazine/30ECSTASY.html | title = Dr. Ecstasy | work = New York Times Magazine | publisher = [[New York Times]] | date = January 30, 2005}}</ref>

== Notable compounds ==
=== Essential amphetamines === <!-- Note: a redirect, [[Essential amphetamines]], links to this subsection -->

The "Essential Amphetamines" are what Shulgin describes as ten amphetamines that differ from natural products such as [[safrole]] or [[myristicin]] by an amine group ([http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal157.shtml ''PIHKAL'' Entry #157 TMA]). The list consists of:
* [[Paramethoxyamphetamine|PMA]] (''para''-'''m'''ethoxy-'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[2,4-DMA]] (2,4-'''d'''i'''m'''ethoxy-'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[3,4-DMA]] (3,4-'''d'''i'''m'''ethoxy-'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine|MDA]] (3,4-'''m'''ethylene'''d'''ioxy-'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[3-Methoxy-4,5-methylendioxyamphetamine|MMDA]] (3-'''m'''ethoxy-4,5-'''m'''ethylen'''d'''ioxy-'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[MMDA-3a]] (2-'''m'''ethoxy-3,4-'''m'''ethylen'''d'''ioxy'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[MMDA-2]] (2-'''m'''ethoxy-4,5-'''m'''ethylen'''d'''ioxy'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[Trimethoxyamphetamine|TMA]] (3,4,5-'''t'''ri'''m'''ethoxy'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[Trimethoxyamphetamine|TMA-2]] (2,4,5-'''t'''ri'''m'''ethoxy'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[DMMDA]] (2,5-'''d'''i'''m'''ethoxy-3,4-'''m'''ethylene'''d'''ioxy'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[DMMDA-2]] (2,3-'''d'''i'''m'''ethoxy-4,5-'''m'''ethylene'''d'''ioxy'''a'''mphetamine)
* [[Tetramethoxyamphetamine|TeMA]] (2,3,4,5-'''te'''tra'''m'''ethoxy'''a'''mphetamine)

Not all of these chemicals are bioassayed in ''PIHKAL'', some are merely mentioned.

=== Magical half-dozen ===

The so-called "magical half-dozen" refers to Shulgin's self-rated most important phenethylamine compounds, all of which except mescaline he developed and synthesized himself. They are found within the first book of ''PIHKAL'', and are as follows:
* [[Mescaline]] (3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine)
* [[2,5-Dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine|DOM]] (2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine), DOM being short for '''d'''es'''o'''xy '''m'''ethyl, referring to the removal of the Oxygen atom from the Methoxy group on the "4" carbon.
* [[2C-B]] (2,5-dimethoxy-4-'''b'''romophenethylamine)
* [[2C-E]] (2,5-dimethoxy-4-'''e'''thylphenethylamine)
* [[2C-T-2]] (2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethyl'''t'''hiophenethylamine)
* [[2C-T-7]] (2,5-dimethoxy-4-propyl'''t'''hiophenethylamine)

All six are now Schedule I controlled substances in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/orangebook/c_cs_alpha.pdf|title=Controlled Substances|last=|first=|date=February 2016|website=[[Drug Enforcement Administration]]|publisher=|access-date=April 13, 2016}}</ref>
