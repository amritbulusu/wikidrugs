==Bio-medical details==
Methionine (abbreviated as '''Met''' or '''M'''; encoded by the codon AUG) is an α-[[amino acid]] that is used in the [[biosynthesis]] of [[protein]]s. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the [[protonated]] −NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> form under biological conditions), an α-[[carboxylic acid]] group (which is in the deprotonated −COO<sup>−</sup> form under biological conditions), and an S-methyl [[thioether]] side chain, classifying it as a [[Chemical polarity|non-polar]], [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] amino acid.

Methionine is coded for by the [[Start codon|initiation codon]], meaning it indicates the start of the [[coding region]] and is the first amino acid produced in a nascent [[Peptide|polypeptide]] during [[mRNA]] [[Translation (biology)|translation]].<ref>{{Cite journal

It has been conjectured that norleucine was present in early versions of the genetic code, but methionine intruded into the final version of the genetic code due to the fact it is used in the cofactor [[S-adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] (SAM).<ref>{{Cite journal

===Encoding===
Methionine is one of only two amino acids encoded by a single [[codon]] (AUG) in the standard [[genetic code]] ([[tryptophan]], encoded by UGG, is the other). In reflection to the evolutionary origin of its codon, the other AUN codons encode isoleucine, which is also a hydrophobic amino acid. In the mitochondrial genome of several organisms, including [[Vertebrate mitochondrial code|metazoa]] and [[The yeast mitochondrial code|yeast]], the codon AUA also encodes for methionine. In the standard genetic code AUA codes for isoleucine and the respective tRNA (''ileX'' in ''Escherichia coli'') uses the unusual base [[Lysidine (nucleoside)|lysidine]] (bacteria) or agmatine (archaea) to discriminate against AUG.<ref>{{Cite journal

The methionine codon AUG is also the most common start codon. A "Start" codon is message for a [[ribosome]] that signals the initiation of protein [[Translation (biology)|translation]] from mRNA when the AUG codon is in a [[Kozak consensus sequence]]. As a consequence, methionine is often incorporated into the N-terminal position of [[protein]]s in [[eukaryote]]s and [[archaea]] during translation, although it can be removed by [[post-translational modification]]. In [[bacteria]], the derivative [[N-Formylmethionine|''N''-formylmethionine]] is used as the initial amino acid.

==Derivatives==

===''S''-adenosyl-methionine===
[[File:S-Adenosyl-L-methionin.svg|thumbnail|left|''S''-Adenosyl-methionine is a cofactor derived from methionine.]]
{{main article|S-adenosyl methionine}}
The methionine-derivative [[S-adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] (SAM) is a cofactor that serves mainly as a [[methyl]] donor. SAM is composed of an adenosyl molecule (via 5' carbon) attached to the sulfur of methionine, therefore making it a [[sulfonium]] cation (i.e., three substituents and positive charge). The sulfur acts as [[HSAB theory|soft Lewis acid]] (i.e., donor/electrophile) allows the ''S''-methyl group to be transferred to an oxygen, nitrogen or aromatic system, often with the aid of other cofactors such as [[cobalamin]] (vitamin B12 in humans). Some enzymes use SAM to initiate a radical reaction, these are called [[radical SAM]] enzymes.
As a result of the transfer of the methyl group, S-adenosyl-homocysteine is obtained. In bacteria, this is either regenerated by methylation or is salvaged by removing the adenine and the homocysteine leaving the compound dihydroxypentandione to spontaneously convert into [[autoinducer-2]], which is excreted as a waste product / quorum signal.

== Biosynthesis ==
[[File:Met biosynthesis.gif|thumb|400px|Methionine biosynthesis]]
As an essential amino acid, methionine is not synthesized [[De novo synthesis|de novo]] in humans and other animals, who must ingest methionine or methionine-containing proteins.  In plants and microorganisms, methionine biosynthesis belongs to the [[aspartate]] family, along with threonine and [[lysine]] (via [[diaminopimelate]], but not via [[Alpha-Aminoadipic acid|α-aminoadipate]]). The main backbone is derived from [[aspartic acid]], while the sulfur may come from [[cysteine]], [[methanethiol]] or [[hydrogen sulfide]].<ref name=review/>
* First, aspartic acid is converted via β-aspartyl-semialdehyde into [[homoserine]] by two reduction steps of the terminal carboxyl group (homoserine has therefore a γ-hydroxyl, hence the [[homologous series|homo-]] series). The intermediate aspartate-semialdehyde is the branching point with the lysine biosynthetic pathway, where it is instead [[Aldol condensation|condensed]] with pyruvate. Homoserine is the branching point with the threonine pathway, where instead it is isomerised after activating the termainal hydroxyl with phosphate (also used for methionine biosynthesis in plants).<ref name=review/>
* Homoserine is then activated with an phosphate, succinyl or acetyl group on the hydroxyl.
** In plants and possibly in some bacteria<ref name=review/> phosphate is used. This step is shared with threonine biosynthesis.<ref name=review/>
** In most organisms, an acetyl group is used to activate the homoserine. This can be catalysed in bacteria by an enzyme encoded by ''metX'' or ''metA'' (not homologues).<ref name=review/> 
** In [[Enterobacteriaceae|enterobacteria]] and a limited amount of other organisms, succinate is used. The enzyme that catalyses the reaction is MetA and the specificity for acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA is dictated by a single reside.<ref name=review/> The physiological basis for the preference of acetyl-CoA or succinyl-CoA is unknown, but such alternative routes are present in some other pathways (''e.g.'' lysine biosynthesis and arginine biosynthesis).
* The hydroxyl activating group is then replaced with [[cysteine]], [[methanethiol]] or [[hydrogen sulfide]]. A replacement reaction is technically a γ-[[Elimination reaction|elimination]] followed by a variant of a [[Michael addition]]. All the enzymes involved are homologues and members of the [[Cys/Met metabolism PLP-dependent enzyme family]], which is a subset of the PLP-dependant fold type I clade. They utilise the cofactor PLP ([[pyridoxal phosphate]]), which functions by stabilising carbanion intermediates.<ref name=review/> 
** If it reacts with cysteine, it produces [[cystathionine]], which is cleaved to yield [[homocysteine]]. The enzymes involved are [[cystathionine-γ-synthase]] (encoded by ''metB'' in bacteria) and [[cystathionine-β-lyase]] (''metC''). Cystathionine is bound differently in the two enzymes allowing β or γ reactions to occur.<ref name=review/> 
** If it reacts with free hydrogen sulfide, it produces homocysteine. This is catalysed by [[O-acetylhomoserine aminocarboxypropyltransferase|''O''-acetylhomoserine aminocarboxypropyltransferase]] (formerly known as ''O''-acetylhomoserine (thiol)-lyase. It is encoded by either ''metY'' or ''metZ'' in bacteria.<ref name=review/> 
** If it reacts with  methanethiol, it produces methionine directly. Methanethiol is a byproduct of catabolic pathway of certain compounds, therefore this route is more uncommon.<ref name=review/> 
* If homocysteine is produced the thiol group is methylated, yielding methionine. Two [[methionine synthase]]s are known, one [[cobalamin]] (vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) dependent and one independent.<ref name=review/>

The pathway utilising cysteine is called the "[[transsulfuration pathway]]", while the pathway utilising hydrogen sulfide (or methanethiol) is called "direct-sulfurylation pathway".

Cysteine is similarly produced, namely it can be made from an activated serine and either from homocysteine ("reverse trans-sulfurylation route") or from hydrogen sulfide ("direct sulfurylation route"); the activated serine is generally ''O''-acetyl-serine (via CysK or CysM in ''E. coli''), but in ''[[Aeropyrum pernix]]'' and some other archaea ''O''-phosphoserine is used.<ref>{{Cite journal

===Trans-sulfurylation pathway===
{{main article|Transsulfuration pathway}}
Enzymes involved in the ''E. coli'' trans-sulfurylation route of methionine biosynthesis:
# [[Aspartokinase]]
# [[Aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase]]
# [[Homoserine dehydrogenase]]
# [[Homoserine O-transsuccinylase]]
# [[Cystathionine-γ-synthase]]
# [[Cystathionine-β-lyase]]
# [[Methionine synthase]] (in mammals, this step is performed by [[homocysteine methyltransferase]] or [[betaine—homocysteine S-methyltransferase]].)

== Other biochemical pathways ==
[[File:Met pathway.gif|thumb|Fates of methionine|400px|Fates of methionine]]
Although mammals cannot synthesize methionine, they can still use it in a variety of biochemical pathways:

===Catabolism===
Methionine is converted to [[S-adenosylmethionine]] (SAM) by (1) [[methionine adenosyltransferase]].

SAM serves as a methyl-donor in many (2) [[methyltransferase]] reactions, and is converted to [[S-adenosylhomocysteine|''S''-adenosylhomocysteine]] (SAH).

(3) [[Adenosylhomocysteinase]] converts SAH to [[homocysteine]].

There are two fates of [[homocysteine]]: it can be used to regenerate methionine, or to form cysteine.

===Regeneration===
Methionine can be regenerated from homocysteine via (4) [[methionine synthase]] in a reaction that requires [[Vitamin B12|Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] as a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]].

Homocysteine can also be remethylated using [[glycine betaine]] (NNN-trimethyl glycine, TMG) to methionine via the enzyme [[betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase]] (E.C.2.1.1.5, BHMT).  BHMT makes up to 1.5% of all the soluble protein of the liver, and recent evidence suggests that it may have a greater influence on methionine and homocysteine homeostasis than methionine synthase.

===Reverse-transulfurylation pathway: conversion to cysteine===
Homocysteine can be converted to cysteine.

* (5) [[Cystathionine-β-synthase]] (a PLP-dependent enzyme) combines homocysteine and serine to produce [[cystathionine]].  Instead of degrading [[cystathionine]] via [[cystathionine-β-lyase]], as in the biosynthetic pathway, cystathionine is broken down to [[cysteine]] and [[α-ketobutyrate]] via (6) [[cystathionine-γ-lyase]].
* (7) The enzyme [[α-ketoacid dehydrogenase]] converts α-ketobutyrate to [[propionyl-CoA]], which is metabolized to [[succinyl-CoA]] in a three-step process (see [[propionyl-CoA]] for pathway).

===Ethylene synthesis===
This [[amino acid]] is also used by [[plant]]s for synthesis of [[ethylene]]. The process is known as the [[Shang Fa Yang|Yang]] Cycle or the [[methionine cycle]].
[[File:Yang-cycle.png|thumb|none|The Yang cycle]]

==Chemical synthesis==
[[Racemic]] methionine can be synthesized from diethyl sodium phthalimidomalonate by alkylation with chloroethylmethylsulfide (ClCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>SCH<sub>3</sub>) followed by hydrolysis and decarboxylation.<ref>{{OrgSynth | last1 = Barger | first1 = G. | last2 = Weichselbaum | first2 = T.

High levels of methionine can be found in eggs, sesame seeds, Brazil nuts, fish, meats and some other plant seeds; methionine is also found in [[cereal]] grains.  Most fruits and vegetables contain very little of it. Most [[legume]]s are also low in methionine. However, it is the combination of methionine and lysine which is considered for completeness of a protein.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Finkelstein JD | journal = J. Nutr.

A 2009 study on rats showed "methionine supplementation in the diet specifically increases mitochondrial [[Reactive oxygen species|ROS]] production and mitochondrial [[DNA]] [[oxidative damage]] in rat liver [[mitochondria]] offering a plausible mechanism for its [[hepatotoxicity]]".<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 19633937 | date = 2009 | last1 = Gomez | first1 = J | last2 = Caro | first2 = P | last3 = Sanchez | first3 = I | last4 = Naudi | first4 = A | last5 = Jove | first5 = M | last6 = Portero-Otin | first6 = M | last7 = Lopez-Torres | first7 = M | last8 = Pamplona | first8 = R | last9 = Barja | first9 = G | title = Effect of methionine dietary supplementation on mitochondrial oxygen radical generation and oxidative DNA damage in rat liver and heart | volume = 41 | issue = 3 | pages = 309–21 | doi = 10.1007/s10863-009-9229-3 | journal = Journal of bioenergetics and biomembranes }}</ref>

However, since methionine is an [[essential amino acid]], it cannot be entirely removed from animals' diets without disease or death occurring over time {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}. For example, rats fed a diet without methionine developed [[steatohepatitis]] (fatty liver), [[anemia]] and lost two thirds of their body weight over 5 weeks. Administration of methionine ameliorated the pathological consequences of methionine deprivation.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1007/s10620-007-9900-7 | author=Oz HS | author2=Chen TS | author3=Neuman M | title=Methionine deficiency and hepatic injury in a dietary steatohepatitis model | journal=Digestive Diseases and Sciences | volume=53 | issue=3 | date=2008 | pages=767–776 | pmid=17710550 | pmc=2271115 }}</ref>

Loss of methionine has been linked to senile greying of hair. Its lack leads to a buildup of hydrogen peroxide in hair follicles, a reduction in tyrosinase effectiveness, and a gradual loss of hair color.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wood, J.M. |pmid=19237503 | doi=10.1096/fj.08-125435 | volume=23 | issue=7 | title=Senile hair graying: H2O2-mediated oxidative stress affects human hair color by blunting methionine sulfoxide repair |journal=FASEB Journal | date=July 2009 | pages=2065–75|displayauthors=1 |author2=Decker H |last3=Hartmann |first3=H |last4=Chavan |first4=B |last5=Rokos |first5=H |last6=Spencer |first6=J.

Methionine is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of [[cysteine]], [[carnitine]], [[taurine]], [[lecithin]], [[phosphatidylcholine]], and other [[phospholipid]]s. Improper conversion of methionine can lead to [[atherosclerosis]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Refsum H| author2 = Ueland PM| author3 = Nygård O| author4 = Vollset SE | journal = Annual Review of Medicine | date = 1998 | volume = 49 | issue = 1 | pages = 31–62 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.med.49.1.31 | title = Homocysteine and Cardiovascular Disease | pmid=9509248}}</ref>

===Other uses===
<small>DL</small>-Methionine is sometimes given as a supplement to dogs; It helps to reduce the chances of stones in dogs. Methionine is also known to increase the urinary excretion of quinidine by acidifying the urine. Aminoglycoside antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections work best in alkaline conditions, and urinary acidification from using methionine can reduce its effectiveness. If a dog is on a diet that acidifies the urine, methionine should not be used.<ref>Grimshaw, Jane (July 25, 2011) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140629112302/http://www.critters360.com/index.php/methionine-for-dogs-uses-and-side-effects-3841/ Methionine for Dogs uses and Side Effects]. critters360.com</ref>
