'''Selumetinib''' ('''AZD6244''') is a [[medical drug|drug]] that was discovered by [[Array BioPharma]] and was licensed to [[AstraZeneca]].  It is being investigated for the treatment of various types of cancer, such as [[non-small cell lung cancer]] (NSCLC).

==Mechanism of action==
The gene [[BRAF gene|''BRAF'']] is part of the [[MAPK/ERK pathway]], a chain of proteins in cells that communicates input from [[growth factor]]s. Activating mutations in the ''BRAF'' gene, primarily V600E (meaning that the amino acid [[valine]] in position 600 is replaced by [[glutamic acid]]), are associated with lower survival rates in patients with [[papillary thyroid cancer]]. Another type of mutation that leads to undue activation of this pathway occurs in the gene ''[[KRAS]]'' and is found in NSCLC. A possibility of reducing the activity of the MAPK/ERK pathway is to block the enzyme [[MAPK kinase]] (MEK), immediately downstream of ''BRAF'', with the drug selumetinib. More specifically, selumetinib blocks the subtypes [[MEK1]] and [[MEK2]] of this enzyme.<ref name="Troiani">{{Cite journal

==Possible uses==
In addition to thyroid cancer, ''BRAF''-activating mutations are prevalent in [[melanoma]] (up to 59%), [[colorectal cancer]] (5–22%), serous [[ovarian cancer]] (up to 30%), and several other tumor types.<ref>{{Cite journal

''KRAS'' mutations appear in 20 to 30% of NSCLC cases and about 40% of colorectal cancer.<ref name="Troiani" />

A Phase II clinical trial about selumetinib in NSCLC has been completed in September 2011;<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00890825|Comparison of AZD6244 in Combination With Docetaxel Versus Docetaxel Alone in KRAS Mutation Positive Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Patients}}</ref> one about cancers with BRAF mutations is ongoing {{as of|2012|6|lc=on}}.<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT00888134|AZD6244 in Cancers With BRAF Mutations}}</ref>

In July 2015 selumetinib failed a Phase III trial testing whether the drug significantly prolonged the survival of patients in a study on [[melanoma]] originating in the eye. In the 152-patient trial, a combination of selumetinib and [[dacarbazine]] failed to improve [[progression-free survival]] compared with just the old drug alone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astrazeneca.com/Media/Press-releases/Article/20150722--astrazeneca-provides-update-on-selumetinib|title=AstraZeneca - AstraZeneca provides update on selumetinib in uveal melanoma|work=astrazeneca.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/astrazenecas-once-lauded-drug-flunks-phase-iii-eye-cancer-trial/2015-07-22|title=AstraZeneca's once-lauded drug flunks a Phase III eye cancer trial|work=FierceBiotech}}</ref>
