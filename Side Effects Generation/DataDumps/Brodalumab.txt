'''Brodalumab''' (US trade name '''Siliq''' Europe '''Kyntheum''' ) is a human [[monoclonal antibody]] designed for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.<ref>{{cite web|title=Statement On A Nonproprietary Name Adopted By The USAN Council: Brodalumab|publisher=[[American Medical Association]]|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/usan/brodalumab.pdf}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/003959/smops/Positive/human_smop_001146.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d127 EMA CHMP opinion on Kyntheum. May 2017]</ref>

In February 2017 it received US [[FDA]] approval to treat moderate to severe [[plaque psoriasis]] in people who have not improved with other treatments.<ref name=FDA2017>{{cite web|last1=Commissioner|first1=Office of the|title=Press Announcements - FDA approves new psoriasis drug|url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm541981.htm?source=govdelivery|website=www.fda.gov|accessdate=18 February 2017|language=en|date=15 February 2017}}</ref> Use is linked to an increased risk of [[suicide]].<ref name=FDA2017/>

== Mechanism of action ==
Brodalumab binds to the [[interleukin-17 receptor]] and so prevents [[interleukin 17]] (IL-17) from activating the receptor. (This mechanism is similar to that of another anti-psoriasis antibody, [[ixekizumab]], which however binds to IL-17 itself.)

==History==
Brodalumab was developed by [[Amgen]], Inc.

In 2013 it was in two phase III clinical trials for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis.<ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT01708590 |Study of Efficacy, Safety, and Withdrawal and Retreatment With Brodalumab in Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis Subjects (AMAGINE-1)}}</ref><ref>{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT01708629|Study of Efficacy and Safety of Brodalumab Compared With Placebo and Ustekinumab in Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis Subjects (AMAGINE-3)}}</ref>

In November 2014, Amgen and [[AstraZeneca]] reported encouraging results for the compound. The companies stated that the compound met the [[primary endpoint]] showing superior skin clearance in a Phase III trial when compared to [[ustekinumab]] and a placebo.<ref>http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/brodalumab-s-no-turkey-in-phase-iii-amgen-and-astrazeneca/81250645/</ref>

However, in May 2015, Amgen announced that it was ending its participation in co-development of the compound because of reports of patients having "events of suicidal ideation and behavior".<ref>{{cite web|title=Amgen to terminate participation in co-development and commercialization of brodaluma|publisher=[[Amgen]]|url=http://www.amgen.com/media/media_pr_detail.jsp?releaseID=2052862}}</ref> AstraZeneca will be solely responsible for any future development and marketing of brodalumab in all territories except for certain Asian territories such as Japan, where [[Kyowa Hakko Kirin]] has rights to brodalumab.

In September 2015, AstraZeneca announced a partnership with [[Valeant Pharmaceuticals]] in which Valeant took over exclusive rights to develop and commercialize brodalumab.<ref>http://www.astrazeneca.com/Media/Press-releases/Article/20150901--astrazeneca-and-valeant-pharmaceuticals-partnership</ref> In July 2016, the rights to commercialize brodalumab in Europe were sold to [[LEO Pharma]].<ref>https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2016/astrazeneca-enters-licensing-agreements-with-leo-pharma-in-skin-diseases-01072016.html</ref>

In January 2016, a [[biologics license application]] (BLA) was submitted to the US FDA.<ref name=BLA2016>[http://seekingalpha.com/news/3048846-fda-accepts-astrazenecas-brodalumab-bla-plaque-psoriasis-pdufa-date-november-16 FDA accepts AstraZeneca's brodalumab BLA for plaque psoriasis, PDUFA date November 16][http://seekingalpha.com/pr/15959796-valeant-announces-fda-acceptance-bla-submission-brodalumab-moderate-severe-plaque-psoriasis Valeant Announces FDA Acceptance of BLA Submission for Brodalumab in Moderate-to-Severe Plaque Psoriasis.
