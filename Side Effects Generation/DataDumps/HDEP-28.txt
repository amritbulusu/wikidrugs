'''HDEP-28''' or '''ethylnaphthidate''' is a [[piperidine]] based [[stimulant]] drug, closely related to [[ethylphenidate]], but with the [[benzene]] ring replaced by [[naphthalene]]. It is even more closely related to [[HDMP-28]], which acts as a potent [[serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor]] with several times the potency of [[methylphenidate]] and a short duration of action.<ref>Lile JA, Wang Z, Woolverton WL, France JE, Gregg TC, Davies HM, Nader MA. The reinforcing efficacy of psychostimulants in rhesus monkeys: the role of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. ''Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics''. 2003 Oct;307(1):356-66. {{PMID|12954808}}</ref>

==Legality==
HDEP-28 was banned in the UK as a [[Temporary Class Drug]] from June 2015 following its unapproved sale as a [[designer drug]], alongside [[4-Methylmethylphenidate]].<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/420983/TCDO_methylphenidate_NPS.pdf Methylphenidate-based NPS: A review of the evidence of use and harm.
