'''Metenolone''', or '''methenolone''', also known as '''methylandrostenolone''', is a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]], [[oral administration|orally active]] [[anabolic-androgenic steroid]] (AAS) and a [[chemical derivative|derivative]] of [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT). Metenolone itself is not used as an AAS, and the drug is instead supplied as [[metenolone acetate]] for [[oral administration]] and as [[metenolone enanthate]] for [[depot injection|depot]] [[intramuscular injection]].<ref name="IndexNominum2000">{{cite book|title=Index Nominum 2000: International Drug Directory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5GpcTQD_L2oC&pg=PA660|date=January 2000|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-3-88763-075-1|pages=660–}}</ref> It is no longer widely used medically.

Metenolone, also known as '''1-methyl-4,5α-dihydro-δ<sup>1</sup>-testosterone''' ('''1-methyl-δ<sup>1</sup>-DHT''') or as '''1-methyl-5α-androst-1-en-17β-ol-3-one''', is a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]] [[androstane]] [[steroid]] and [[chemical derivative|derivative]] of [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT).

==Society and culture==

===Use in sports===
As an AAS, the use of metenolone is banned from use in sports governed by the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wada-ama.org/Documents/World_Anti-Doping_Program/WADP-Prohibited-list/2012/WADA_Prohibited_List_2012_EN.pdf |title=The World Anti-Doping Code: The 2012 Prohibited List |publisher=[[World Anti-Doping Agency]] |accessdate=2012-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513020202/http://www.wada-ama.org/Documents/World_Anti-Doping_Program/WADP-Prohibited-list/2012/WADA_Prohibited_List_2012_EN.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-13 |df= }}</ref> [[Belarus]]ian [[shot put]]ter [[Nadzeya Ostapchuk]] was stripped of her gold medal after testing positive for metenolone at the London [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympic Games]].<ref>{{cite web|title=IOC withdraws gold medal from shot put athlete Nadzeya Ostapchuk|url=http://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-withdraws-gold-medal-from-shot-put-athlete-nadzeya-ostapchuk/172684|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=13 August 2012}}</ref>

The [[NBA]] and [[National Basketball Players Association|NBPA]] also banned the use of metenolone under the Anti-Drug Program. In February 2013, [[Hedo Türkoğlu]] of the [[Orlando Magic]] was suspended for 20 games without pay by the league after testing positive for metenolone.<ref>{{cite web|title=Magic's Hedo Turkoglu suspended 20 games|url=http://www.nba.com/2013/news/02/13/turkoglu-suspended-official-release/index.html}}</ref>

In December 2013, [[Natalia Volgina]] was stripped of her 2013 Old Mutual [[Two Oceans Marathon]] title and received a two-year competition ban, subsequent to a final guilty verdict for using metenolone.<ref>http://www.sport24.co.za/OtherSport/Athletics/South-Africa/Two-Oceans-winner-loses-title-20131205</ref>

The infamous "duchess" cocktail administered to Russian athletes at the Sochi Winter Olympics consisted of [[oxandrolone]], metenolone, and [[trenbolone]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=McLaren|first1=Richard|title=WADA investigation of Sochi allegations|url=https://www.wada-ama.org/sites/default/files/resources/files/mclaren_report_part_ii_2.pdf|accessdate=9 December 2016}}</ref>
