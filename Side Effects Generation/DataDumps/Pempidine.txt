'''Pempidine''' is a [[Ganglionic blocker|ganglion-blocking drug]], first reported in 1958 by two research groups working independently, and introduced as an oral treatment for [[hypertension]].<ref>A. Spinks and E. H. P. Young (1958) ''Nat.'' '''181''' 1397</ref><ref>G. E. Lee et al. (1958) ''Nat.'' '''181''' 1717.</ref>

==Pharmacology==
Reports on the "classical" pharmacology of pempidine have been published.<ref name = Spinks>A. Spinks et al. (1958) ''Br. J. Pharmacol. Chemother.'' '''13''' 501-520.</ref><ref>D. F. Muggleton and H. W.Reading (1959) ''Br. J. Pharmacol. Chemother.'' '''14''' 202</ref> The Spinks group, at [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]], compared pempidine, its ''N''-ethyl analogue, and [[mecamylamine]] in considerable detail, with additional data related to several structurally simpler compounds.<ref name = Spinks/>

==Toxicology==
LD<sub>50</sub> for the HCl salt of pempidine in mice: 74&nbsp;mg/kg (i.v.); 125&nbsp;mg/kg (i.p.); 413&nbsp;mg/kg (p.o.).<ref name = Spinks/>

==Chemistry==
Pempidine is an [[aliphatic]], [[sterically hindered]], cyclic, [[tertiary]] [[amine]], which is a [[weak base]]: in its [[protonated]] form it has a pK<sub>a</sub> of 11.25.<ref name = Hall>H. K. Hall (1957) ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' '''79''' 5447-5451.</ref>

Pempidine is a liquid, b.p.&nbsp;187–188°; d = 0.858 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.<ref name = Spinks/>

Two early syntheses of this compound are those of Leonard and Hauck,<ref name = Leonard>N. J. Leonard and F. P. Hauck (1957) ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' '''79''' 5279-5292.</ref> and Hall.<ref name = Hall/> These are very similar in principle: Leonard and Hauck reacted [[phorone]] with [[ammonia]], to produce [[triacetone amine|2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidone]],<ref>The "trivial" name of this compound is triacetonamine.</ref> which was then reduced by means of the [[Wolff–Kishner reduction]] to [[2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine]]; this secondary amine was then ''N''-methylated using [[methyl iodide]] and [[potassium carbonate]].<ref>The boiling point of 147° given by these authors for their ''N'',2,2,6,6-pentamethylpiperidine (pempidine) is significantly below the range of ~182–188° reported by other chemists.</ref>

Hall's method involved reacting [[acetone]] with ammonia in the presence of [[calcium chloride]] to give 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidone, which was then reduced under Wolff-Kishner conditions, followed by ''N''-methylation of the resulting 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine with [[methyl p-toluenesulfonate]].
