'''Climbazole''' is a topical [[Antifungal medication|antifungal]] agent commonly used in the treatment of human fungal skin infections such as [[Seborrhoeic dermatitis|dandruff]]<ref name=pmid11534318>{{cite journal |pmid=11534318 |year=2001 |last1=Wigger-Alberti |first1=W |last2=Kluge |first2=K |last3=Elsner |first3=P |title=Clinical effectiveness and tolerance of climbazole containing dandruff shampoo in patients with seborrheic scalp eczema |volume=90 |issue=33 |pages=1346â€“9 |journal=Praxis}}</ref> and [[eczema]]. Climbazole has shown a high ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo'' efficacy against ''[[Pityrosporum ovale]]'' that appears to play an important role in the pathogenesis of dandruff.<ref name=pmid11534318/> Its chemical structure and properties are similar to other fungicides such as [[ketoconazole]] and [[miconazole]].

==Indications and formulations==
It is most commonly found as an active ingredient in [[over-the-counter substance|OTC]] anti-dandruff and anti-fungal products, including shampoos, lotions and conditioners. It may be accompanied by other active ingredients such as [[zinc pyrithione]] or [[triclosan]].

==Side effects==
May cause localized irritation of the skin with symptoms including redness, rashes and itching.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}
