Esmolol prevents the action of two naturally occurring substances: [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]].

==Dosing==
Esmolol is given by slow intravenous [[Injection (medicine)|injection]]. It is commonly used in patients during surgery to prevent or treat [[tachycardia]], and is also used in treatment of [[acute supraventricular tachycardia]].  Esmolol is also the drug of choice when [[aortic dissection]] is suspected.

==Metabolism==
Esmolol is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis of the ester linkage, chiefly by the esterases in the cytosol of red blood cells and not by plasma cholinesterases or red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase. Total body clearance in man was found to be about 20 L/kg/hr, which is greater than cardiac output; thus the metabolism of esmolol is not limited by the rate of blood flow to metabolizing tissues such as the liver or affected by hepatic or renal blood flow.  Esmolol's short duration of action is based on the [[ester]]-[[methyl]] side chain which allows for quick hydrolysis. Esmolol's structure is reflected in its name, '''es-m'''olol as in '''es'''ter-'''m'''ethyl. Plasma cholinesterases and red cell membrane acetylcholinesterase do not have any action. This metabolism results in the formation of a free acid and [[methanol]]. The amount of methanol produced is similar to endogenous methanol production. Esmolol has a rapid distribution half-life of about 2 minutes and an elimination half-life of about 9 minutes.
