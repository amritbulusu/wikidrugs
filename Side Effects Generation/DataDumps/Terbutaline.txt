'''Terbutaline''' ([[trade name]]s "Bronclyn",''Brethine'', ''Bricanyl'', ''Brethaire'', or ''Terbulin'') is a [[beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist|β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptor agonist]], used as a "reliever" inhaler in the management of [[asthma]] symptoms and as a [[tocolytic]] (anti-[[Uterine contraction|contraction]] medication) to delay [[preterm labor]] for up to 48 hours. This time can then be used to administer steroid injections to the mother which help fetal lung maturity and reduce complications of prematurity.<ref>{{cite web|last=WHO|title=Antenatal administration of corticosteroids for women at risk of preterm birth|url=http://apps.who.int/rhl/pregnancy_childbirth/complications/preterm_birth/cd004454_hofmeyrgj_com/en/index.html|publisher=WHO|accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref>  It should not be used to prevent preterm labor or delay labor more than 48–72 hours. In February 2011, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] has ordered to put a boxed warning on the drug's label. Pregnant women should not be given injections of the drug terbutaline for the prevention of preterm labor or for long-term (beyond 48–72 hours) management of preterm labor, and should not be given oral terbutaline for any type of prevention or treatment of preterm labor "due to the potential for serious internal heart problems and death."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://yourlife.usatoday.com/parenting-family/pregnancy/story/2011/02/FDA-flags-risks-on-popular-drug-used-during-pregnancy/43875986/1?csp=34news | work=USA Today | title=Most Popular E-mail Newsletter | date=18 February 2011}}</ref><ref>http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm243840.htm</ref>

The [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] also discourages the use of terbutaline for preventing preterm labor.

Terbutaline is currently on the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]]'s list of prohibited drugs, except when administered by inhalation and a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) has been obtained in advance.

==Uses==
Terbutaline is used as a fast-acting [[bronchodilator]] (often used as a short-term asthma treatment) and as a [[tocolytic]]<ref name="pmid18554601">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mohamed Ismail NA, Ibrahim M, Mohd Naim N, Mahdy ZA, Jamil MA, Mohd Razi ZR |title=Nifedipine versus terbutaline for tocolysis in external cephalic version |journal=Int J Gynaecol Obstet |volume=102 |issue=3 |pages=263–6 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18554601 |doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2008.04.010 |url=}}</ref> to delay [[premature labor]]. The inhaled form of terbutaline starts working within 15 minutes and can last up to 6 hours.

Terbutaline as a treatment for premature labor is an [[off-label use]] not approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]. It is a [[pregnancy category]] C medication and is routinely prescribed to stop contractions. After successful intravenous tocolysis, little evidence exists that oral terbutaline is effective.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Goldenberg, RL |title=High-Risk Pregnancy Series: An Expert's View |journal=Obstetrics & Gynecology |volume=100 |pages=1020–1037 |date=November 2002 |url=http://www.acog.org/from_home/publications/green_journal/2002/ong13732fla.htm |issue=5 |doi=10.1016/S0029-7844(02)02212-3 }}</ref> However, following uterine inversion in the third stage of labor, terbutaline (or either [[Halothane]] or [[magnesium sulfate]]) can be used to relax the uterus if necessary prior to uterine replacement.

== Structure activity relationships ==
The tertiary butyl group in terbutaline makes it more selective for [[Beta-2 adrenergic receptor|β<sub>2</sub> receptors]]. Since there is no hydroxy group on position 4 of the benzene ring, the molecule is less susceptible to metabolism by the enzyme [[Catechol-O-methyl transferase|catechol-''O''-methyl transferase]].<ref>[http://pharmaxchange.info/notes/medicinal_chemistry/adrenergics_cholinergics.html Medicinal Chemistry of Adrenergics and Cholinergics]</ref>

==Chemistry==
It is synthesized by brominating 3,5-dibenzyloxy[[acetophenone]] into the appropriate 3,5-dibenzyloxybromoacetophenone, which is reacted with ''N''-[[benzyl]]-''N''-''tert''-butylamine, giving the aminoketone. Reduction of this product by hydrogen over a palladium catalyst leads to terbutaline.<ref>Draco Lunds Farmacevtiska Aktiebolag, {{Cite patent|GB|1199630}} (1967)</ref><ref>Draco Lunds Farmacevtiska Aktiebolag, {{Cite patent|BE|704932}} (1968)</ref><ref>A.
