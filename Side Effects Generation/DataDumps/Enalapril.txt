===Pregnancy and breastfeeding===
Enalapril is [[pregnancy category D]]. Some evidence suggests it will cause injury and death to a developing fetus. Patients are advised not to become pregnant while taking enalapril and to notify their doctors immediately if they become pregnant. In pregnancy, enalapril may result in damage to the fetus’s kidneys and resulting [[oligohydramnios]] (not enough amniotic fluid). Enalapril is secreted in breast milk and is not recommended for use while breastfeeding.<ref name=label>[http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=08f90170-f53c-4272-92ae-951cf115e271 FDA Label: Enalapril Maleate Tablet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416182907/http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=08f90170-f53c-4272-92ae-951cf115e271 |date=2014-04-16 }} Last updated April 2011</ref>

==Side effects==
The most common side effects of enalapril include increased [[serum creatinine]] (20%), dizziness (2–8%), low blood pressure (1–7%), syncope (2%), and dry cough (1–2%). The most serious common adverse event is [[angioedema]] (swelling) (0.68%) which often affects the face and lips, endangering the patient’s airway. Angioedema can occur at any point during treatment with enalapril but is most common after the first few doses.<ref name=label/> Angioedema and fatality therefrom is reportedly higher among black people.<ref name=label/>

==Mechanism of action==
{{see also|Renin–angiotensin system}}
Normally, [[angiotensin I]] is converted to [[angiotensin II]] by an [[angiotensin-converting enzyme]] (ACE). Angiotensin II constricts blood vessels, increasing blood pressure. By inhibiting the ACE, [[enalaprilat]], the active metabolite of enalapril, decreases levels of angiotensin II leading to less vasoconstriction and decreased blood pressure.<ref name=label/>

==Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics==
Pk and Pd are as follows:<ref name=label/>
* Onset of action: about  1 hour
* Peak effect: 4–6 hours
* Duration: 12–24 hours
* Absorption: ~60%
* Metabolism: prodrug, undergoes biotransformation to [[enalaprilat]]<ref>Menard J and Patchett A. Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors. Pp 14-76 in Drug Discovery and Design.

==History==
Squibb developed the first ACE inhibitor, [[captopril]], but it had adverse effects such as a metallic taste (which, as it turned out, was due to the [[sulfhydryl]] group). [[Merck & Co.]] developed enalapril as a competing prodrug.<ref>Jenny Bryan for The Pharmaceutical Journal, 17 Apr 2009 [http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/news-and-analysis/news/from-snake-venom-to-ace-inhibitor-the-discovery-and-rise-of-captopril/10884359.article From snake venom to ACE inhibitor — the discovery and rise of captopril] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150126073742/http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/news-and-analysis/news/from-snake-venom-to-ace-inhibitor-the-discovery-and-rise-of-captopril/10884359.article |date=2015-01-26 }}</ref><ref name=HistDD>Jie Jack Li, History of Drug Discovery.

[[Enalaprilat]] was developed partly to overcome these limitations of captopril. The sulfhydryl moiety was replaced by a carboxylate moiety, but additional modifications were required in its structure-based design to achieve a potency similar to captopril. Enalaprilat, however, had a problem of its own in that it had poor oral availability. This was overcome by the researchers at Merck by the [[Ester#Esterification of carboxylic acids|esterification]] of enalaprilat with ethanol to produce enalapril.<ref name=HistDD/>{{rp|13}}

Merck introduced enalapril to market in 1981; it became Merck's first billion-dollar selling drug in 1988.<ref name=HistDD/>{{rp|13}} The patent expired in 2000, opening the way for generics.<ref>Staff, Drug Discovery Online.
