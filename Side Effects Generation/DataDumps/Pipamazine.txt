'''Pipamazine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]; trade names '''Mornidine''', '''Mometine''', '''Nausidol''') is a drug of the [[phenothiazine]] class formerly used as an [[antiemetic]]. It is chemically related to [[chlorpromazine]], but has negligible [[antipsychotic]] activity and produces few [[extrapyramidal symptoms|extrapyramidal side effects]].<ref name=Frota>{{cite book | author=Frota LH |title=Cinqüenta anos de medicamentos antipsicóticos em psiquiatria |edition=1st |language=Portuguese |isbn=85-903827-1-0 |location=Rio de Janeiro |publisher=UFRJ |year=2003 |pages=486 |url=http://www.medicina.ufrj.br/cursos/LH%20FROTA%20-%201%20Ed%20-%2050%20ANOS%20DE%20MEDICAMENTOS%20ANTIPSICOTICOS.pdf}}</ref>

Pipamazine was introduced to the U.S. market in 1959 by [[G. D. Searle & Company]]. It was advertised for [[morning sickness]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=[No authors listed] |title=Now she can cook breakfast again... |journal=[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]] |volume=81 |issue=1 |date=July 1959 |pages=59 |format=PDF |pmc=1830735|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1830735/pdf/canmedaj00808-0002.pdf}} Advertisement.</ref> and [[postoperative nausea and vomiting]], and was claimed to reduce the need for postoperative [[analgesic|analgesia]].<ref name=AnnSurg>{{cite journal |author=[No authors listed] |title=Lessened postoperative vomiting with MORNIDINE |journal=[[Annals of Surgery]] |volume=151 |issue=4 |date=April 1960 |format=PDF |pmc=1613578|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1613578/pdf/annsurg01301-0002.pdf }} Advertisement.</ref>
It was eventually withdrawn from the U.S. market in 1969, after reports of [[hepatotoxicity]] (liver injury).<ref>{{Federal Register|34|12051}}. July 17, 1969.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Wysowski DK, Swartz L |title=Adverse drug event surveillance and drug withdrawals in the United States, 1969–2002: the importance of reporting suspected reactions |journal=[[Archives of Internal Medicine]] |volume=165 |issue=12 |pages=1363–9 |date=June 2005 |pmid=15983284 |doi=10.1001/archinte.165.12.1363}}</ref>

There is very little published information on pipamazine; it is mostly absent from modern-day sources, apart from a few passing mentions in the pharmacological literature.<ref name=Frota/>

==Adverse effects==
Mornidine advertisements for postoperative recovery claimed "unusually low side effects".<ref name=AnnSurg/> However, contemporary comparative trials found that [[hypotension]] (low blood pressure) was a substantial concern when the drug was given at normal dosages for this indication; blood pressure reductions of up to 70&nbsp;mmHg were reported.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Blatchford E |title=Studies of anti-emetic drugs: A comparative study of cyclizine (Marzine), pipamazine (Mornidine), trimethobenzamide (Tigan), and hyoscine |journal=Canadian Journal of Anesthesia |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=159–65 |date=March 1961 |doi=10.1007/BF03021345}}</ref> Reductions in dosage mitigated hypotension while maintaining antiemetic efficacy.

In his book ''The Creation of Psychopharmacology'', Irish psychiatrist [[David Healy (psychiatrist)|David Healy]] states that the failure of pipamazine to perform as a neuroleptic and its negative side effect profile helped Searle lose interest in the antipsychotic sector, and contributed to the company's refusal to market [[haloperidol]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite book |author=Healy D |chapter=Explorations in a new world |title=The creation of psychopharmacology |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2002 |pages=123–4 |isbn=0-674-01599-1}}</ref>
