'''Tanezumab''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], codenamed '''RN624''') is a [[monoclonal antibodies|monoclonal antibody]] against [[nerve growth factor]]. It was developed by [[Pfizer]] as a treatment for pain.<ref>[http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/365/tanezumab.doc N05], ''American Medical Association''.</ref>

In 2009 there was a [[clinical trial#Phase III|Phase III]] trial for knee pain due to [[osteoarthritis|osteoarthritis (OA)]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00733902 |title=Tanezumab in Osteoarthritis of the Knee}} 2009</ref>
Another Phase III trial for hip pain in OA <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00744471 |title=Tanezumab in Osteoarthritis Of The Hip}}</ref> was halted in June 2010 when some patients needed hip replacement.<ref>http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/trials-halted-as-pfizer-s-tanezumab-shown-to-worsen-osteoarthritis/81243572/</ref>

Tanezumab is undergoing [[clinical trial#Phase II|Phase II]] clinical trials for the treatment of various pain entities, including chronic low back pain, [[Cancer pain#Bone|bone cancer pain]], and interstitial cystitis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=Tanezumab&phase=1 |title=Phase II trials involving Tanezumab}}</ref>

In March of 2012, the Anti-NGF Testing - FDA Committee voted in favor of a continuation of the development of nerve-blocking medications, as long as certain safety precautions were observed.<ref>http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/ArthritisAdvisoryCommittee/UCM295205.pdf</ref> <ref>http://www.fda.gov/downloads/advisorycommittees/committeesmeetingmaterials/drugs/arthritisadvisorycommittee/ucm301305.pdf</ref>

A Phase III trial published in 2013 found tanezumab was superior to placebo for painful hip osteoarthritis.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Tanezumab reduces osteoarthritic hip pain: results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial.|last = |first = |date = Jul 2013|journal = Arthritis Rheum.|accessdate = |doi = 10.1002/art.37950|pmid = 23553790 |volume=65 |pages=1795â€“803}}</ref>
