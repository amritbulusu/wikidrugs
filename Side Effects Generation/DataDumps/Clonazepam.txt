Clonazepam is prescribed for [[epilepsy]] and [[panic disorder]] with or without [[agoraphobia]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rossetti AO |author2=Reichhart MD|author3=Schaller MD|author4=Despland PA|author5=Bogousslavsky J |date=July 2004 |title=Propofol treatment of refractory status epilepticus: a study of 31 episodes |journal=Epilepsia |volume=45 |issue=7 |pages=757–63 |pmid=15230698 |doi=10.1111/j.0013-9580.2004.01904.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ståhl Y, Persson A, Petters I, Rane A, Theorell K, Walson P  |title=Kinetics of clonazepam in relation to electroencephalographic and clinical effects |journal=Epilepsia |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=225–31 |date=April 1983 |pmid=6403345 |doi= 10.1111/j.1528-1157.1983.tb04883.x }}</ref>

===Seizures===
Clonazepam, like other benzodiazepines, while being a first-line treatment for acute seizures, is not suitable for the long-term treatment of seizures due to the development of tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects.

Clonazepam has been found effective in treating epilepsy in children, and the inhibition of seizure activity seemed to be achieved at low plasma levels of clonazepam.<ref name="pmid 12657420">{{cite journal | pmid = 12657420 | volume=28 | issue=1 | title=Reduction of seizures with low-dose clonazepam in children with epilepsy |date=January 2003 | journal=Pediatr.

Clonazepam has been found to be effective in the acute control of non-convulsive [[status epilepticus]]; however, the benefits tended to be transient in many of the people, and the addition of [[phenytoin]] for lasting control was required in these patients.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Epilepsia |date=May–Jun 1986 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=276–85 |title=Nonconvulsive status epilepticus: high incidence of complex partial status |author2=Svanborg E, Wedlund JE |pmid=3698940 |author=Tomson T |doi=10.1111/j.1528-1157.1986.tb03540.x}}</ref>

===Drowsiness===
Clonazepam, like other benzodiazepines, may impair a person's ability to drive or operate machinery. The central nervous system depressing effects of the drug can be intensified by alcohol consumption, and therefore alcohol should be avoided while taking this medication. Benzodiazepines have been shown to cause dependence. Patients dependent on clonazepam should be slowly titrated off under the supervision of a qualified healthcare professional to reduce the intensity of withdrawal or rebound symptoms.

===Withdrawal-related===
* Anxiety, irritability, insomnia, tremors
* Potential to exacerbate existing panic disorder upon discontinuation
* Seizures<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lockard JS |author2=Levy RH|author3=Congdon WC|author4=DuCharme LL|author5=Salonen LD |title=Clonazepam in a focal-motor monkey model: efficacy, tolerance, toxicity, withdrawal, and management |journal=Epilepsia |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=683–95 |date=December 1979 |pmid=115680 |doi=10.1111/j.1528-1157.1979.tb04852.x}}</ref> similar to [[delirium tremens]] (with long-term use of excessive doses)

===Tolerance and withdrawal===
{{Main article|Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome}}
Like all benzodiazepines, clonazepam is a GABA-positive [[allosteric modulator]].<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=3033417 |date=May 1987 |author1=Adjeroud, S |author2=Tonon, Mc |author3=Leneveu, E |author4=Lamacz, M |author5=Danger, Jm |author6=Gouteux, L |author7=Cazin, L |author8=Vaudry, H |title=The benzodiazepine agonist clonazepam potentiates the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid on alpha-MSH release from neurointermediate lobes in vitro |volume=40 |issue=19 |pages=1881–7 |journal=Life Sciences |url= |format= |doi=10.1016/0024-3205(87)90046-4 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=11906969 |date=March 2002 |author1=Yokota, K |author2=Tatebayashi, H |author3=Matsuo, T |author4=Shoge, T |author5=Motomura, H |author6=Matsuno, T |author7=Fukuda, A |author8=Tashiro, N |title=The effects of neuroleptics on the GABA-induced Cl− current in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons: differences between some neuroleptics |volume=135 |issue=6 |pages=1547–55 |pmc=1573270 |doi=10.1038/sj.bjp.0704608 |journal=[[British Journal of Pharmacology]] |format=PDF }}</ref> One-third of individuals treated with benzodiazepines for longer than four weeks develop a dependence on the drug and experience a withdrawal syndrome upon dose reduction. High dosage and long-term use increase the risk and severity of dependence and withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal seizures and psychosis can occur in severe cases of withdrawal, and anxiety and insomnia can occur in less severe cases of withdrawal. A gradual reduction in dosage reduces the severity of the [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]]. Due to the risks of tolerance and withdrawal seizures, clonazepam is generally not recommended for the long-term management of epilepsies. Increasing the dose can overcome the effects of tolerance, but tolerance to the higher dose may occur and adverse effects may intensify. The mechanism of tolerance includes receptor desensitization, down regulation, receptor decoupling, and alterations in subunit composition and in [[gene transcription]] coding.<ref name="Riss-2008"/>

** Impaired balance
** Dizziness
* Respiratory depression
* [[Hypotension|Low blood pressure]]

===Detection in biological fluids===
Clonazepam and 7-aminoclonazepam may be quantified in [[Blood plasma|plasma]], [[serum (blood)|serum]] or [[whole blood]] in order to monitor compliance in those receiving the drug therapeutically. Results from such tests can be used to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdosage. Both the parent drug and 7-aminoclonazepam are unstable in biofluids, and therefore specimens should be preserved with sodium fluoride, stored at the lowest possible temperature and analyzed quickly to minimize losses.<ref>R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 335-337.</ref>

===Special precautions===
The elderly metabolize benzodiazepines more slowly than younger individuals and are also more sensitive to the effects of benzodiazepines, even at similar blood plasma levels. Doses for the elderly are recommended to be about half of that given to younger adults and are to be administered for no longer than two weeks. Long-acting benzodiazepines such as clonazepam are not generally recommended for the elderly due the risk of drug accumulation.<ref name="Riss-2008"/>

The elderly are especially susceptible to increased risk of harm from motor impairments and drug accumulation side effects. Benzodiazepines also require special precaution if used by individuals that may be pregnant, alcohol- or drug-dependent, or may have [[comorbid]] [[psychiatric disorders]].<ref name="Authier-2009">{{Cite journal | last1 = Authier | first1 = N. | last2 = Balayssac | first2 = D. | last3 = Sautereau | first3 = M. | last4 = Zangarelli | first4 = A. | last5 = Courty | first5 = P. | last6 = Somogyi | first6 = AA. | last7 = Vennat | first7 = B. | last8 = Llorca | first8 = PM. | last9 = Eschalier | first9 = A. | title = Benzodiazepine dependence: focus on withdrawal syndrome | journal = Ann Pharm Fr | volume = 67 | issue = 6 | pages = 408–13 |date=November 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharma.2009.07.001 | pmid = 19900604 }}</ref> Clonazepam is generally not recommended for use in elderly people for insomnia due to its high potency relative to other benzodiazepines.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Wolkove | first1 = N. | last2 = Elkholy | first2 = O. | last3 = Baltzan | first3 = M. | last4 = Palayew | first4 = M. | title = Sleep and aging: 2.

==Pregnancy==
{{See also|Long-term effects of benzodiazepines#Neonatal effects}}
There is some medical evidence of various malformations, e.g., cardiac or facial deformations when used in early pregnancy; however, the data is not conclusive. The data are also inconclusive on whether benzodiazepines such as clonazepam cause developmental deficits or decreases in IQ in the developing fetus when taken by the mother during pregnancy. Clonazepam, when used late in pregnancy, may result in the development of a severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome in the [[neonate]]. Withdrawal symptoms from benzodiazepines in the [[neonate]] may include [[hypotonia]], [[apnoeic]] spells, [[cyanosis]] and impaired [[metabolic]] responses to cold stress.<ref>{{cite journal |author=McElhatton PR |year=1994 |title=The effects of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy and lactation |journal=Reprod Toxicol |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=461–75 |pmid=7881198 |doi=10.1016/0890-6238(94)90029-9}}</ref>

The safety profile of clonazepam during pregnancy is less clear than that of other benzodiazepines, and if benzodiazepines are indicated during pregnancy, [[chlordiazepoxide]] and [[diazepam]] may be a safer choice. The use of clonazepam during pregnancy should only occur if the clinical benefits are believed to outweigh the clinical risks to the [[fetus]]. Caution is also required if clonazepam is used during breastfeeding. Possible adverse effects of use of benzodiazepines such as clonazepam during pregnancy include: [[miscarriage]], [[malformation]], [[intrauterine growth retardation]], functional deficits, [[floppy infant syndrome]], [[carcinogenesis]] and [[mutagenesis]]. Neonatal withdrawal syndrome associated with benzodiazepines include [[hypertonia]], [[hyperreflexia]], [[anxiety|restlessness]], [[irritability]], abnormal sleep patterns, inconsolable crying, [[tremor]]s or jerking of the extremities, [[bradycardia]], [[cyanosis]], [[suckling]] difficulties, [[apnea]], risk of aspiration of feeds, [[diarrhea]] and vomiting, and [[growth retardation]]. This syndrome can develop between 3 days to 3 weeks after birth and can have a duration of up to several months. The pathway by which clonazepam is metabolized is usually impaired in newborns. If clonazepam is used during pregnancy or [[breast feeding]], it is recommended that serum levels of clonazepam are monitored and that signs of [[central nervous system]] depression and [[apnea]] are also checked for. In many cases, non-pharmacological treatments, such as relaxation therapy, psychotherapy and avoidance of [[caffeine]], can be an effective and safer alternative to the use of benzodiazepines for anxiety in pregnant women.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Iqbal |first1=MM. |last2=Sobhan |first2=T. |last3=Ryals |first3=T. |title=Effects of commonly used benzodiazepines on the fetus, the neonate, and the nursing infant |url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/53/1/39 |journal=Psychiatr Serv |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=39–49 |date=Jan 2002 |pmid=11773648 |doi=10.1176/appi.ps.53.1.39 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Clonazepam acts by binding to the benzodiazepine site of the GABA receptors, which enhances the electric effect of GABA binding on neurons, resulting in an increased influx of chloride ions into the neurons. This further results in an inhibition of synaptic transmission across the [[central nervous system]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Skerritt JH |author2=Johnston GA |date= May 6, 1983 |title=Enhancement of GABA binding by benzodiazepines and related anxiolytics |journal=Eur J Pharmacol |volume=89 |issue=3–4 |pages=193–8 |pmid=6135616 |doi=10.1016/0014-2999(83)90494-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Lehoullier PF, Ticku MK |title=Benzodiazepine and beta-carboline modulation of GABA-stimulated 36Cl-influx in cultured spinal cord neurons |journal=Eur.

Clonazepam's primary [[mechanism of action]] is the modulation of [[GABA]] function in the brain, by the benzodiazepine receptor, located on [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors]], which, in turn, leads to enhanced GABAergic inhibition of neuronal firing. Benzodiazepines do not replace GABA, but instead enhance the effect of GABA at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor by increasing the opening frequency of chloride ion channels, which leads to an increase in GABA's inhibitory effects and resultant central nervous system depression.<ref name="Riss-2008"/> In addition, clonazepam decreases the utilization of [[Serotonin|5-HT (serotonin)]] by neurons<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Adv Neurol | year = 1986| volume = 43| pages = 687–706| title = Drugs acting on amino acid neurotransmitters| author = Meldrum BS| pmid = 2868623}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Jenner P |author2=Pratt JA|author3=Marsden CD | year = 1986 | title = Mechanism of action of clonazepam in myoclonus in relation to effects on GABA and 5-HT | journal = Adv Neurol | volume = 43 | pages = 629–43 | pmid = 2418652 }}</ref> and has been shown to bind tightly to central-type benzodiazepine receptors.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gavish M |author2=Fares F |date=November 1985 | title = Solubilization of peripheral benzodiazepine-binding sites from rat kidney | journal = J Neurosci | volume = 5 | issue = 11 | pages = 2889–93 | pmid = 2997409 | url = http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/reprint/5/11/2889.pdf | format = PDF }}</ref> Because clonazepam is effective in low milligram doses (0.5&nbsp;mg clonazepam = 10&nbsp;mg diazepam),<ref>"Benzodiazepine Equivalency Table" based on ''NRHA Drug Newsletter, April 1985 and Benzodiazepines: How they Work & How to Withdraw (The Ashton Manual), 2002.''[http://www.benzo.org.uk/bzequiv.htm]</ref> it is said to be among the class of "highly potent" [[benzodiazepines]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chouinard G |title=Issues in the clinical use of benzodiazepines: potency, withdrawal, and rebound |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=65 Suppl 5 |issue= |pages=7–12 |year=2004 |pmid=15078112 |doi= |url=}}</ref> The anticonvulsant properties of benzodiazepines are due to the enhancement of [[Synapse|synaptic]] GABA responses, and the inhibition of sustained, high-frequency repetitive firing.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Adv Neurol | year = 1986| volume = 44| pages = 713–36| title = Anticonvulsant drugs: mechanisms of action| author = Macdonald RL|author2=McLean MJ| pmid = 2871724}}</ref>

==Pharmacokinetics==
Clonazepam is lipid-soluble, rapidly crosses the [[blood–brain barrier]], and penetrates the placenta. It is extensively metabolised into pharmacologically inactive metabolites. Clonazepam is metabolized extensively via nitroreduction by [[cytochrome P450]] enzymes, particularly [[CYP2C19]] and to a lesser extent [[CYP3A4]]. [[Erythromycin]], [[clarithromycin]], [[ritonavir]], [[itraconazole]], [[ketoconazole]], [[nefazodone]], [[cimetidine]], and grapefruit juice are inhibitors of CYP3A4 and can affect the metabolism of benzodiazepines.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Dresser | first1 = G.K. | last2 = Spence | first2 = J.D. | last3 = Bailey | first3 = D.G. | title = Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic consequences and clinical relevance of cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibition | journal = Clin.

===Recreational use===
{{See also|Benzodiazepine misuse}}
A 2006 US government study of emergency department visits found that sedative-hypnotics were the most frequently implicated pharmaceutical drug in ED visits, with benzodiazepines accounting for the majority of these. Clonazepam was the second most frequently implicated benzodiazepine in ED visits, however, it should be noted that alcohol alone was responsible for over twice as many ED visits than clonazepam in the same study. The study examined the number of times the non-medical use of certain drugs were implicated in ED visit. The criteria for non-medical use in this study were purposefully broad, and include, for example, [[drug abuse]], accidental or intentional [[overdose]], or adverse reactions resulting from legitimate use of the medication.<ref name=dawn2neodredv>{{cite web |url= http://www.samhsa.gov/data/DAWN/files/ED2006/DAWN2k6ED.htm |title= Drug Abuse Warning Network, 2006: National Estimates of Drug-Related Emergency Department Visits |accessdate= 9 February 2009 |year= 2006 |publisher= [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140316023656/http://www.samhsa.gov/data/DAWN/files/ED2006/DAWN2k6ED.htm |archivedate= 16 March 2014 |df=  }}</ref>
