'''Chloropyramine''' is a classical ("old" or first generation) [[H1 antagonist|antihistamine]] drug approved in some Eastern European countries (like [[Russia]]) for the treatment of [[allergic conjunctivitis]], [[allergic rhinitis]], [[bronchial asthma]], and other [[atopic]] (allergic) conditions. Related indications for clinical use include [[angioedema]] (Quincke's edema), allergic reactions to insect bites, food and drug allergies, and [[anaphylactic shock]].

Chloropyramine is known as a competitive reversible H<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist (also known as an H<sub>1</sub> inverse agonist), meaning that it exerts its pharmacological action by competing with [[histamine]] for the H<sub>1</sub> subtype histamine receptor. By blocking the effects of histamine, the drug inhibits the vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and tissue edema associated with histamine release in the tissue. The H<sub>1</sub> antagonistic properties of chloropyramine can be used by researchers for the purposes of blocking the effects of [[histamine]] on cells and tissues. In addition, chloropyramine has some [[anticholinergic]] properties.<ref name = "PI" />

Chloropyramine's anticholinergic properties and the fact that it can pass through the [[blood–brain barrier]] are linked to its clinical side effects: drowsiness, weakness, vertigo, fatigue, dryness in the mouth, constipation, and rarely — visual disturbances and increase of intraocular pressure.

==Clinical dosage and administration==
In cases of severe allergic reactions, chloropyramine can be injected intramuscularly or intravenously. Oral administration: In adults, 25&nbsp;mg can be taken 3 to 4 times daily (up to 150&nbsp;mg); in children over 5 years old, 25&nbsp;mg can be taken 2 to 3 times daily. For external application, the skin or the eye conjunctiva can be treated up to several times a day by applying a thin layer of cream or ointment containing 1% chloropyramine hydrochloride.

==Contraindications==
Contraindications for parenteral or oral administration include [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]], [[peptic ulcer]], pyloric and duodenal stenosis, uncontrolled [[glaucoma]], [[pregnancy]] and breast-feeding. It is not intended for the management of acute [[bronchospasm]].<ref name = "PI" />

==Special warnings and precautions==
Chloropyramine should not be used internally with alcohol, sedative drugs and hypnotics because of the potentiation of the effects. It should be used with caution in patients suffering from [[hyperthyroidism]], cardiovascular diseases and asthma. In children, it can induce agitation, and in many adult patients dizziness may be observed. Because of the pronounced sedative effect the preparation should be prescribed cautiously in drivers and people working with machines.

==Drug interactions==
Chloropyramine should not be used internally with [[MAO inhibitors]]. Because of its anticholinergic activity, concurrent administration with [[Parasympathomimetic drug|cholinomimetics]] is not advisable. General anesthetics, analgesic agents and psycholeptics potentiate the sedative effect of chloropyramine.

The preparation  begins with the condensation of 4-chlorobenzaldehyde with [[1,1-Dimethylethylenediamine|1,1-dimethy<nowiki>[</nowiki>ethylenediamine]].  The resulting [[Schiff base]] is reduced.  The resulting amine is then further reacts with [[2-Bromopyridine|2-bromopyridine]] in the presence of sodamide.
