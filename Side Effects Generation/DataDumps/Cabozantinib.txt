'''Cabozantinib''', sold under the brand-name '''Cabometyx''' and '''Cometriq''', is a medication used to treat [[medullary thyroid cancer]] and a second line treatment for [[renal cell carcinoma]] among others. It is a [[small molecule]] [[Tyrosine-kinase inhibitor|inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases]] [[c-Met]] and [[VEGFR2]], and also inhibits [[AXL receptor tyrosine kinase|AXL]] and RET.  It was discovered and developed by [[Exelixis]] Inc. 

==Medical use==
Cabozantinib is used in two forms.  A capsule form is used to treat [[medullary thyroid cancer]]<ref name=USlabelCapsule>{{cite web|title=Cabozantinib capsules (Cometriq) US label |url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2016/203756s002lbl.pdf|publisher=FDA|date=May 2016}} For label updates see [https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=overview.process&ApplNo=203756 FDA index page for NDA 203756]</ref><ref name=UKlabelCapsule>{{cite web|title=Cabozantinib capsule (Cometriq) UK Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) - (eMC)|url=https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/32559|publisher=UK Electronic Medicines Compendium|language=en|date=November 2016}}</ref> and a tablet form is used as a second line treatment for [[renal cell carcinoma]].<ref name=USlabelTablet>{{cite web|title=Cabozantinib tablets (Cabometyx) US label |url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2016/208692s000lbl.pdf|publisher=FDA|date=April 2016}} For label updates see [https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=overview.process&ApplNo=208692 FDA index page for NDA 208692]</ref><ref name=UKlabelTablet>{{cite web|title=Cabozantinib tablet (Cabometyx) UK Summary of Product Characteristics|url=https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/32431|publisher=UK Electronic Medicines Compendium|language=en|date=September 2016}}</ref>

==Contraindications==
Cabozantinib has not been tested in pregnant women; it causes harm to fetuses in rodents.  Pregnant women should not take this drug, and women should not become pregnant while taking it.  It is not known if cabozantinib is excreted in breast milk.<ref name=UKlabelCapsule/><ref name=UKlabelTablet/>

The drug should be used with caution in people with a history of  heart rhythm problems, including long QT interval.<ref name=UKlabelTablet/>

==Adverse effects==
In the US, the capsule formulation (Cometriq) carries a [[black box warning]] of the risk of [[gastrointestinal perforation|holes forming in the stomach or intestines]] as well as formation of [[fistulas]] (tunnels between the GI tract and the skin).  The black box also warns against the risk of uncontrolled bleeding.<ref name=USlabelCapsule/>  The tablet formulation (Cabometyx) warns of these effects as well.<ref name=USlabelTablet/><ref name=UKlabelCapsule/><ref name=UKlabelTablet/>

The labels also warn of the risk of clots forming and causing heart attacks or strokes, high blood pressure including [[hypertensive crisis]], osteonecrosis of the jaw, severe diarrhea, [[Chemotherapy-induced acral erythema|skin sloughing off the palms and soles]], [[Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome|a syndrome with headaches, confusion, loss of vision, and seizures]], and protein appearing in urine.<ref name=USlabelCapsule/><ref name=USlabelTablet/><ref name=UKlabelCapsule/><ref name=UKlabelTablet/>

Very common adverse effects (greater than 10% of people) include decreased appetite; low calcium, potassium, phosphate, and magnesium levels; high [[bilirubin]] levels; distorted sense of taste, headache, and dizziness; high blood pressure; distorted sense of hearing, earaches and sore throat; diarrhea, nausea, constipation, vomiting, stomach pain and upset stomach, and inflammation of the mouth and lips and a burning sensation in the mouth; skin sloughing off the palms and soles, hair color changes and hair loss, rash, dry skin, and red skin; joint pain and muscle spasms; fatigue and weakness; weight loss, [[elevated transaminases]], higher cholesterol levels, and loss of red and white blood cells.<ref name=UKlabelTablet/>

Common adverse effects (between 1% and 10% of people) include abscesses (inside the body, on the skin, and in teeth skin), pneumonia, inflamed hair follicles, fungal infections, low thyroid levels, dehydration, loss of [[albumin]], anxiety, depression, and confusion, peripheral neuropathy, tingling, and tremor, tinnitus, atrial fibrillation, low blood pressure, blocked veins, paleness, chills, fistulas forming in the trachea and esophagus, blood clots in the lungs, and bleeding in the respiratory tract, GI perforation, bleeding in the stomach and intestines, pancreatitis, hemorrhoids, anal fissure, anal inflammation, gallstones, hard skin growths, acne, blisters, abnormal hair growth, loss of skin color and skin flaking, chest pain, blood or protein in urine, wounds that don't heal well, and facial swelling.<ref name=UKlabelTablet/>

==Interactions==
Grapefruit and grapefruit juice should be avoided as they may increase the concentration of the drug in the blood.<ref name=UKlabelTablet/>

Cabozantinib is a substrate of [[CYP3A4]] and [[multidrug resistance-associated protein 2]]; drugs that inhibit these enzymes will make more cabozantinib and increase its adverse effects; drugs that activate them may cause cabozantinib to be ineffective.<ref name=UKlabelTablet/>

It inhibits [[P-glycoprotein]], so will change the availability of other drugs that depend on this transporter.<ref name=UKlabelTablet/>

==Pharmacology==
It inhibits the following [[receptor tyrosine kinase]]s: MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor protein) and VEGFR, RET, GAS6 receptor (AXL), KIT), and Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3).<ref name=UKlabelTablet/>

==History==
Cabozantinib (previously XL184) was granted [[orphan drug]] status by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in January 2011.<ref>[http://www.euroinvestor.co.uk/news/story.aspx?id=11524393 Exelixis’ XL184 Granted Orphan Drug Designation and Assigned the Generic Name Cabozantinib.] Jan 2011</ref>
