== Medical uses ==

=== Adults ===
Valganciclovir is commonly used for treatment of [[cytomegalovirus]] (CMV) [[retinitis]] (eye infection may cause blindness) in people who have acquired [[immunodeficiency]] syndrome (AIDS).<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a605021.html#why|title=Valganciclovir: MedlinePlus Drug Information|website=medlineplus.gov|access-date=2016-11-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110112925/https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a605021.html#why|archivedate=2016-11-10|df=}}</ref> Valganciclovir is also used to prevent cytomegalovirus disease in people who have received a heart, kidney, or kidney-pancreas transplant and who have a chance of getting CMV disease.<ref name=":3" /> Overall, valganciclovir works by preventing the spread of CMV disease or slowing the growth of CMV.

=== Children ===
Valganciclovir is used for the prevention of CMV disease in people following kidney transplant (4 months to 16 years of age) and heart transplant (1 month to 16 years of age) at high risk.<ref name=":1" />

== Side effects ==
Valganciclovir is commonly associated with vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and headache.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/drugs/271/valganciclovir-hydrochloride/0/professional#S7|title=Valganciclovir Hydrochloride {{!}} FDA Label - Powder (for solution), tablet (film coated) {{!}} AIDSinfo|website=AIDSinfo|access-date=2016-11-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223175446/https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/drugs/271/valganciclovir-hydrochloride/0/professional#S7|archivedate=2016-12-23|df=}}</ref> Other side effects include fever, [[insomnia|trouble sleeping]], [[peripheral neuropathy]], and [[retinal detachment]].<ref name=":1" />

Of note, the FDA issued several [[Boxed warning|black box warnings]] concerning potential severe toxicities. These include:
* Blood toxicities: [[neutropenia]], [[anemia]], [[thrombocytopenia]]<ref name=":1" />
* Impairment of fertility (based on animal studies only)<ref name=":1" />
* Fetal toxicities (based on animal studies only)<ref name=":1" />
* [[Mutagenesis]] and [[carcinogenesis]] (based on animal studies only)<ref name=":1" />

== Drug interactions ==
While not studied in people, it can be assumed that interactions will be similar as those with [[ganciclovir]], since valganciclovir is converted into ganciclovir in the body.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/drugs/271/valganciclovir-hydrochloride/0/professional#S7|title=Valganciclovir Hydrochloride {{!}} FDA Label - Powder (for solution), tablet (film coated) {{!}} AIDSinfo|website=AIDSinfo|access-date=2016-11-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223175446/https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/drugs/271/valganciclovir-hydrochloride/0/professional#S7|archivedate=2016-12-23|df=}}</ref> [[Zidovudine]] may decrease the concentration of ganciclovir, and together the drugs can cause [[anemia]] and [[neutropenia]].<ref name=":0" /> [[Probenecid]] can increase the concentration of ganciclovir, which could increase the chances of ganciclovir toxicity.<ref name=":0" /> People with kidney problems could have an increase in both [[Mycophenolic acid|mycophenolate mofetil]] and ganciclovir concentrations when both drugs are taken together.<ref name=":0" /> Ganciclovir can also increase the concentration of [[didanosine]].<ref name=":0" />

== Mechanism of action ==
Valganciclovir is a prodrug for [[ganciclovir]], which is a synthetic analog of 2′-deoxy-[[guanosine]]. Its structure is the same as ganciclovir, except for the addition of a L-valyl ester at the 5' end of the incomplete [[deoxyribose]] ring. The valine increases both the absorption of the drug in the intestines, as well as the bioavailability of the drug once it is absorbed. The L-valyl ester is cleaved by [[esterase]]s in the intestines and the liver, leaving ganciclovir to be absorbed by the virus-infected cells.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lukacova|first=V.|last2=Goelzer|first2=P.|last3=Reddy|first3=M.|last4=Greig|first4=G.|last5=Reigner|first5=B.|last6=Parrott|first6=N.|date=2016-11-01|title=A Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Model for Ganciclovir and Its Prodrug Valganciclovir in Adults and Children|journal=The AAPS journal|volume=18|issue=6|pages=1453–1463|doi=10.1208/s12248-016-9956-4|issn=1550-7416|pmid=27450227}}</ref>

Ganciclovir is first [[Phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] to ganciclovir monophosphate by a viral thymidine kinase encoded by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) upon infection.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Matthews|first=T.|last2=Boehme|first2=R.|date=2016-08-01|title=Antiviral activity and mechanism of action of ganciclovir|journal=Reviews of Infectious Diseases|volume=10 Suppl 3|pages=S490–494|issn=0162-0886|pmid=2847285}}</ref> Human cellular kinases further phosphorylate the molecule to create ganciclovir diphosphate, then ganciclovir triphosphate.<ref name=":2" /> These kinases are present in 10-fold greater concentrations in CMV or [[Herpes simplex virus|herpes simplex virus (HSV)]]-infected cells compared to uninfected human cells, allowing ganciclovir triphosphate to concentrate in infected cells.<ref name=":2" />

Ganciclovir triphosphate is a competitive inhibitor of [[Deoxyguanosine triphosphate|deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP)]].<ref name=":2" /> It is incorporated into viral DNA and preferentially inhibits viral DNA polymerases more than cellular DNA polymerases. Ganciclovir triphosphate serves as a poor substrate for chain elongation. Once incorporated into viral DNA due to its structure similarity to dGTP, chain termination occurs once a single nucleotide is added to the distal hydroxyl group of the incomplete deoxyribose ring of ganciclovir.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Han|last2=Beardsley|first2=G. Peter|last3=Coen|first3=Donald M.|date=2014-12-09|title=Mechanism of ganciclovir-induced chain termination revealed by resistant viral polymerase mutants with reduced exonuclease activity|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=111|issue=49|pages=17462–17467|doi=10.1073/pnas.1405981111|issn=1091-6490|pmc=4267342|pmid=25422422}}</ref>

== Pharmacokinetics ==

# Oral [[bioavailability]] is approximately 60%. Fatty foods significantly increase the bioavailability and the peak level in the [[blood plasma|serum]].
# It takes about 2 hours to reach maximum [[concentration]]s in the serum.
# Valganciclovir is eliminated as ganciclovir in the urine, with a [[half-life]] of about 4 hours in people with normal [[kidney function]].
# The mechanism of this drug is activation via a viral protein kinase HCMV UL97 and subsequent phosphorylation by cellular kinases. The phosphotransferase enzyme can likewise activate valganciclovir.

===Price and patent status===
Roche's Valcyte is protected by [[patent]]. However a generic version manufactured by Japanese-owned Indian company [[Ranbaxy Laboratories|Daiichi-Ranbaxy]] was found by the [[United States District Court for the District of New Jersey|District Court of New Jersey]], USA not to infringe Roche's patent.<ref>[http://www.pharmexcil.com/data/uploads/US_Court_rules_Ranbaxy%27s_generic_valganciclovir.pdf US Court rules Ranbaxy's generic valganciclovir does not infringe Roche's Valcyte patent] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030554/http://www.pharmexcil.com/data/uploads/US_Court_rules_Ranbaxy's_generic_valganciclovir.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}</ref>
In November 2014, FDA approved generics by two manufacturers.<ref>{{cite web|website=http://www.fda.gov/drugs/developmentapprovalprocess/howdrugsaredevelopedandapproved/drugandbiologicapprovalreports/andagenericdrugapprovals/ucm422394.htm}}</ref>

The price of a four-month course of valganciclovir from Roche is about US$8,500 in high-income countries, $6,000 in India. However, the valganciclovir patent was rejected by the [[Indian Patent Office]]<ref name=India>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120303202514/http://www.msf.org.uk/victory_for_access_to_medicine_20100506.news Valganciclovir rejected by the Indian Patent Office]</ref> in 2010, although Roche may [[appeal]] the rejection
