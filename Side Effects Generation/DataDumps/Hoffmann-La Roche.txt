'''F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG''' is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[multinational corporation|multinational]] healthcare company that operates worldwide under two divisions: [[Pharmaceutical company|Pharmaceutical]]s and [[Roche Diagnostics|Diagnostics]]. Its [[holding company]], '''Roche Holding AG''', has bearer shares listed on the [[SIX Swiss Exchange]]. The company headquarters are located in [[Basel]].

The company controls the American biotechnology company [[Genentech]], which is a wholly owned affiliate, and the Japanese biotechnology company [[Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.|Chugai Pharmaceuticals]], as well as the United States-based [[Ventana Medical Systems|Ventana]]. Roche's revenues during fiscal year 2016 were 50.58 billion [[Swiss franc]]s,<ref name="FR16" /> or approximately US$50 billion. Roche is the third-largest pharma company worldwide.<ref name="pharmexec50">[http://www.pharmexec.com/pharmexec/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=815158 Pharm Exec's 2013 ranking of the top 50 pharma companies worldwide], www.pharmexec.com.

Descendants of the founding Hoffmann and Oeri families own slightly over half of the bearer shares with voting rights (a pool of family shareholders 45%, and Maja Oeri a further 5% apart), with Swiss pharma firm [[Novartis]] owning a further third of its shares. Roche is one of the few companies increasing their dividend every year, for 2016 as the 30th consecutive year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roche.com/de/investors/ir_update/inv-update-2014-03-04.htm|title=Roche - Roche Annual General Meeting 2014|work=roche.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314234724/http://www.roche.com/de/investors/ir_update/inv-update-2014-03-04.htm|archivedate=14 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> F.

==History==
Founded in 1896 by [[Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche]], the company was early on known for producing various [[vitamin]] preparations and derivatives. In 1934, it became the first company to mass-produce synthetic [[vitamin C]], under the brand name [[Redoxon]]. In 1957 it introduced the class of [[tranquilizer]]s known as [[benzodiazepine]]s (with [[Diazepam|Valium]] and [[Flunitrazepam|Rohypnol]] being the best known members). It manufactures and sells several [[cancer]] drugs and is a leader in this field. In 1956, the first antidepressant, [[iproniazid]], was accidentally created during an experiment while synthesizing [[isoniazid]]. Originally, it had been intended to create a more efficient drug at combatting [[Tuberculosis]]. [[Iproniazid]], however, revealed to have its own benefits; some people felt it made them feel happier. It was withdrawn from the market in the early 1960s due to toxic side-effects.

In 1976, an accident at a chemical factory in [[Seveso]], Italy, owned by a subsidiary of Roche caused a large [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]] contamination; see [[Seveso disaster]]. In 1982, the United States arm of the company acquired Biomedical Reference Laboratories for US$163.5 million. That company dated from the late 1960s, and was located in [[Burlington, North Carolina]]. That year Hoffmann–La Roche then merged it with all of its laboratories, and incorporated the merged company as Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. in Burlington. By the early 1990s, Roche Biomedical became one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the United States, with 20 major laboratories and US$600 million in sales.<ref name="fundingroche">{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Roche-Biomedical-Laboratories-Inc-Company-History.html|title=Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc|publisher= FundingUniverse.com}}</ref>

Roche has also produced various [[HIV test]]s and [[antiretroviral drug]]s. It bought the [[patent]]s for the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) technique in 1992. In 1995 the era of [[Management of HIV/AIDS|highly active anti-retroviral therapy]] (HAART) was initiated by the United States FDA's approval of Hoffman LaRoche's HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir. Within 2 years of its approval (and that of ritonavir 4 months later) annual deaths from AIDS in the United States fell from over 50,000 to approximately 18,000 <ref>{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = HIV Surveillance --- United States, 1981—2008 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6021a2.htm | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 8 November 2013 }}</ref> On 28 April 1995 Hoffmann–La Roche sold Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. to National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc. (which then changed its name to [[Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings]]).<ref name="sec950515">[http://www.secinfo.com/ds2yr.a4.htm Laboratory Corp of America Holdings · 10-Q · For 3/31/95], SECInfo.com, Filed On 5/15/95, SEC File 1-11353, Accession Number 920148-95-11</ref> Roche acquired [[Syntex]] in 1994 and [[Chugai Pharmaceuticals]] in 2002.

[[Oseltamivir]] is considered to be the primary antiviral drug used to combat avian influenza, commonly known as the [[H5N1|bird flu]]. Roche is the only drug company authorized to manufacture the drug, which was discovered by [[Gilead Sciences]].  Roche purchased the rights to the drug in 1996 and in 2005 settled a royalty dispute, agreeing to pay Gilead tiered royalties of 14–22% of annual net sales without adjusting the payments for manufacturing costs, as had been allowedin the original licensing agreement.<ref name="royalty">{{cite news|url=http://www.redherring.com/Article.aspx?a=14507&hed=Roche%2C+Gilead+End+Tamiflu+Feud

On 20 October 2005, Hoffmann–La Roche decided to license other companies to manufacture Oseltamivir.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1120533,00.html|title=Why Roche Released Tamiflu|accessdate=2008-05-22|last=Kher|first=Unmesh|date=2005-10-19|work=Time|publisher=Time Inc.}}</ref>

Also in 2005, Roche acquired the Swiss company GlycArt Biotechnology in order to acquire technology to [[Afucosylated monoclonal antibodies|afucosylate antibodies]]; one of its products in development was [[obinutuzumab]], which gained FDA approval in November 2013 for the treatment of [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]].<ref name="roche">{{cite web |url=http://www.roche.com/media/store/releases/med-cor-2005-07-19.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205033013/http://www.roche.com/media/store/releases/med-cor-2005-07-19.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 February 2015 |title=Roche - Roche acquires Swiss based GlycArt Biotechnology to strengthen expertise in therapeutic antibody research |publisher=roche.com |accessdate=2015-04-29 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160305002757/https://ec.europa.eu/research/health/pdf/event04/joel-jean-mairet-31032011_en.pdf Presentation: GlycArt Biotechnology AG From Inception to trade sale – and what happened after...] by Dr. Joël Jean-Mairet.

== Price-fixing conspiracy ==
{{see also|Cartel}}

[[Stanley Adams (whistleblower)|Stanley Adams]], Roche's World Product Manager in Basel, contacted the [[European Economic Community]] in 1973 with evidence that Roche had been breaking [[antitrust laws]], engaging in [[price fixing]] and market sharing for vitamins with its competitors. Roche was fined accordingly, but a bungle on the part of the EEC allowed the company to discover that it was Adams who had blown the whistle. He was arrested for unauthorised disclosure&nbsp;— an offence under Swiss law&nbsp;— and imprisoned. His wife, having learnt that he might face decades in jail, committed suicide.<ref name=observer>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2001/nov/25/businessofresearch.research | title=Blowing the final whistle | last = Mathiason | first = Nick| work=[[The Observer]] | date=25 November 2001 | accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref>

In 1999 the firm pleaded guilty to participation in a worldwide conspiracy to raise and fix prices for [[vitamin supplement|vitamins]] sold in the USA and globally.  Hoffmann-La Roche paid $500 million in criminal fines to the United States.<ref>[http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/top100.html#Annotated Corporate Crime Reporter]. Corporate Crime Reporter.
