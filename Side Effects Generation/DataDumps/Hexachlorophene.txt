'''Hexachlorophene''', also known as '''Nabac''', is an [[organochlorine compound]] that was once widely used as a [[disinfectant]]. The compound occurs as a white odorless solid, although commercial samples can be off-white and possess a slightly [[phenol]]ic odor. It is insoluble in water but dissolves in [[acetone]], [[ethanol]], [[diethyl ether]], and [[chloroform]]. In [[medicine]], hexachlorophene is a useful as a [[topical]] anti-infective, anti-bacterial agent, often used in soaps and toothpaste. It is also used in agriculture as a soil [[fungicide]], [[plant]] [[bactericide]], and [[acaricide]].<ref name=Ullmann>{{cite journal |author1=Fiege, H. |author2=Voges, H.-M. |author3=Hamamoto, T |author4=Umemura, S. |author5=Iwata, T. |author6=Miki, H. |author7=Fujita, Y. |author8=Buysch, H.-J. |author9=Garbe, D. |author10=Paulus, W. |title= Phenol Derivatives |journal= Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |volume= |issue= |pages= |year= 2000 |publisher= Wiley-VCH |location= Weinheim |doi= 10.1002/14356007.a19_313 |isbn= 3-527-30673-0}}</ref> 
==Commercialization==
{{Globalize|article|the United States|date=August 2015}}

===US, and removal from market===
In 1972, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) halted the production and distribution of products containing more than 1% of hexachlorophene.<ref name=hex>''[[Germicide]] Limit Stirs Confusion'', New York Times, September 24, 1972, pg. 53.</ref> After that point, most products that contain hexachlorophene were available only by prescription from a doctor.<ref name=Dial>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hHRQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YhEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3621,2685761&dq=dial+hexachlorophene&hl=en The Milwaukee Sentinel: "US Order Curbs Hexachlorophene" (UPI), September 23, 1972. From Google News.]</ref> The restrictions were enacted after 15 deaths in the United States and 39 deaths in France were reported following brain damage caused by hexachlorophene.<ref name=Ocala>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&dat=19730321&id=dI5PAAAAIBAJ&sjid=fQUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7064,4239653&hl=en Ocala Star Banner, "15 Deaths Cited In Use of Germ Killer, Hexachlorophene" (AP), March 21, 1973. From Google News.]</ref>

At least three companies manufactured over-the-counter preparations incorporating hexachlorophene. One product was ''Baby Magic Bath'' by [[The Mennen Company]]. Mennen recalled the product in 1971, and it was removed from retail distribution. Immediately after the withdrawal, there was an outbreak of ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' infections in hospitals across the USA.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid= 4700144 |year= 1973 |last1= Dixon |first1= RE |last2= Kaslow |first2= RA |last3= Mallison |first3= GF |last4= Bennett |first4= JV |title= Staphylococcal disease outbreaks in hospital nurseries in the United States--December 1971 through March 1972 |volume= 51 |issue= 2 |pages= 413–7 |journal= Pediatrics}}</ref>

Two commercial preparations using hexachlorophene, ''[[Phisoderm|pHisoDerm]]'' and ''pHisoHex'', were widely used as antibacterial skin cleansers in the treatment of [[acne]], with ''pHisoDerm'' developed for those allergic to the active ingredients in ''pHisoHex''. In the US during the 1960s, both were available over the counter. After the ban was enacted, ''pHisoDerm'' was reformulated without hexachlorophene, and continued to be sold over-the-counter, while ''pHisoHex'', which contained 3% hexachlorophene (three times the legal limit imposed in 1972),<ref name=Ocala/> became available (and remains available today) as a prescription body wash. In the European Community countries during the 1970s and 1980s, ''pHisoHex'' was available over the counter. A related product, ''pHisoAc'', was used as a [[facial|skin mask]] to dry and peel away acne lesions. Another preparation, ''pHiso-Scrub'', was a hexachlorophene-impregnated sponge for scrubbing, has since been discontinued. Several substitute products (including [[triclosan]]) were developed, but none had the germ-killing capability of hexachlorophene. Sanofi-Aventis was the sole manufacturer of ''pHisoHex'', while [[Mentholatum|The Mentholatum Company]] owns the ''pHisoDerm'' brand today. Sanofi-Aventis discontinued production of several forms of ''pHisoHex'' in August 2009 and discontinued all production of ''pHisoHex'' in September 2013.<ref>http://www.ashp.org/menu/DrugShortages/DrugsNoLongerAvailable/Bulletin.aspx?id=1059.</ref>

The formula for [[dial (soap)|Dial soap]] was changed to remove hexachlorophene after the FDA put an end to over-the-counter availability in 1972.<ref name=Dial/>

The third company involved in the production of products with hexachlorophene was surprisingly the now natural cosmetic company J.R. Watkins Company, Winnona, Minn. At one time they produced "Watkins Cologne for Men" available in a six ounce bottle. The label read: "For after bath or after shaving. Checks perspiration odor. Contains: Hexachlorophene.

===Europe===
In Germany, cosmetics containing hexachlorophene have been forbidden since 1985. In Austria, sale of drugs containing the substance has been forbidden since 1990.<ref>[http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Bundesnormen/NOR12134873/NOR12134873.html Rechtsinformationssystem des österreichischen Bundeskanzleramtes] {{de icon}}</ref>

==Production==
Hexacholorophene is produced by alkylation of 2,4,5-[[trichlorophenol]] with [[formaldehyde]]. Related antiseptics are prepared similarly, e.g., bromochlorophene and [[dichlorophene]].<ref name=Ullmann/>

==Safety==
The [[LD50]] (oral, rat) is 59&nbsp;mg/kg, indicating that the compound is relatively toxic. It is not [[mutagen]]ic nor [[teratogen]]ic according to Ullmann's Encyclopaedia,<ref name=Ullmann/> but "embryotoxic and produces some teratogenic effects" according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer.<ref name=IARC>{{cite journal |title= Hexachlorophene |journal= International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) - Summaries & Evaluations |volume= 20 |pages= 241 |origyear= 1979 |year= 1998 |publisher= IPCS Inchem |url= http://www.inchem.org/documents/iarc/vol20/hexachlorophene.html}}</ref> [[2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin]] (TCDD) is always a contaminant in this compounds production. Several accidents releasing many kilograms of TCDD have been reported. The reaction between 2,4,5-[[trichlorophenol]] and Formaldehyde is exothermic, if this reaction goes without adequate cooling, TCDD becomes a major byproduct/contaminant. Examples of TCDD disaster due to Hexachlorophene production: [[Seveso disaster]], [[Times Beach, Missouri]], Etc.    

==Trade names==
Trade names for hexachlorophene include: ''Acigena'', ''Almederm'', ''AT7'', ''AT17'', ''Bilevon'', ''Exofene'', ''Fostril'', ''Gamophen'', ''G-11'', ''Germa-Medica'', ''Hexosan'', ''K-34'', ''Septisol'', ''Surofene''.<ref name="pharmgkb">{{cite web |title=Hexachlorophene |publisher=PharmGKB |url=http://www.pharmgkb.org/drug/PA449871#tabview=tab1&subtab=31 |accessdate=2012-12-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dept. of Health, Education, and Welfare|title=Consumer news|journal=Office of Consumer Affairs|date=1972|volume= 2|issue= 21|page=10}}</ref>
