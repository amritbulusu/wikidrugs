'''Ancrod''' (current brand name: '''Viprinex''') is a [[defibrinogenating]] agent derived from the [[venom]] of the [[Malayan pit viper]]. Defibrinogenating blood produces an [[anticoagulant]] effect. Ancrod is not approved or marketed in any country.

==Medical use==
As of 2017 ancrod was not marketed for any medical use.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ancrod|url=http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800004881|publisher=AdisInsight|accessdate=5 February 2017|language=en}}</ref>

===Pregnancy===
Category X : Ancrod was not found to be [[teratogenic]] in animal studies, but some [[fetal]] deaths occurred as a result of [[placental hemorrhages]] in animals given high doses; therefore, it should not be used during pregnancy as the defibrinogenation mechanism of ancrod might be expected to interfere with the normal implantation of the fertilized egg.

==Contraindications and precautions==
* Known [[bleeding disorders]] of any origin or any unexplained excessive bleedings in the past.
* [[Platelet count]]s of less than 100,000 (even if asymptomatic), exemption : HIT (Heparin- induced thrombocytopenia).
* Planned [[surgery]] or short before [[Childbirth|delivery]].
* Active [[Peptic ulcer|ulcerations]] of the GIT.
* Any kind of [[malignant]] disease.
* [[Renal stones]] (increased likelihood of significant urological bleeding).
* Severe and uncontrolled [[arterial hypertension]].
* Active [[pulmonary tuberculosis]].
* Impaired [[fibrinolysis]].
* Severe [[liver disease]].
* Manifest or impending [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]].
* I.M.-Injection : Ancrod should not be injected i.m., because of rapid induction of neutralizing [[antibodies]] and thus [[drug resistance]].

==Side effects==
In clinical trials for [[ischemic stroke]], ancrod increased the risk of intracebrral hemorrhage.<ref name=Cochrane2012/>

* Hypersensitivity reactions : Local or generalized [[skin reactions]] ([[rash]] and [[urticaria]]); appearance of neutralizing [[antibodies]] to ancrod with partial or total loss of ancrod activity (drug resistance).
* Sometimes pain at injection site (normally mild). This side effect may be, if necessary, treated with local or oral [[antihistaminic]] drugs (e.g., [[clemastine]], or [[diphenhydramine]]). Bleeding at injection site, [[thrombophlebitis]] at local veins, and (paradoxical) arterial thrombotic events.
* Occasionally deposition of cleaved fibrinogen derivates in the spleen resulting in [[splenomegaly]]; rupture is possible, if the [[spleen]] is palpated too strongly (life-threatening bleeding and need of [[splenectomy]] may result).
* Specific side effects are local and systemic bleeding events. Local bleeding events may be treated with local pressure or [[surgical dressings]], if necessary. Compared with other anticoagulants the risk of systemic bleeding is relatively low. If systemic bleeding is severe enough to warrant fast reversal of ancrod action, fibrinogen should be substituted (please refer to section 'special antidotes').
* Occasionally, increased headache has been found in patients with known [[migraine]].
* Also, [[chills]] and [[fever]] may occur infrequently.

[[Thrombocytopenia]] as side effect has never been noticed with ancrod in contrast to heparin.

==Pharmacology==
Ancrod has a triple mode of action. The exact structure and chemical data such as molecular weight are unknown, but it has been elaborated that the [[glycosylation]] of the molecule is an important factor. Glycosylation is remarkably homogenous with the major [[oligosaccharide]] accounting for approximately 90% of the total sugar content. Some [[in vitro]] reactions have been explored in detail (see ref. #2, www.blckwell-synergy). It was found that ancrod's actions are [[flavin adenine dinucleotide|FAD]] dependent and that the substance has interesting [[apoptotic]] properties (causing programmed cell death), which remain to be explored.

The [[Biological half-life|half-life]] of ancrod is 3 to 5 hours and the drug is cleared from [[blood plasma]], mainly [[renally]].

Due to its special mode of action (see below) and its price, Arwin has never been used as 'normal' anticoagulant such as [[heparin]], but only for the symptomatic treatment of moderate to severe forms of peripheral arterial [[circulatory disorders]] such as those resulting from years of heavy smoking and/or [[arteriosclerosis]].

The substance is intended for [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous]] injection and [[intravenous]] infusion, and indirectly inhibits [[wikt:aggregation|aggregation]], [[adhesion]], and release of [[thrombocytes]] mediated through the action of a fibrinogen degradation product (FDP). It also cleaves and therefore inactivates a significant part of circulating plasma [[fibrinogen]]. Fibrinogen is often found in increased concentrations in arteriae with impaired circulation. This leads to a pathologically increased blood [[viscosity]] and thereby to a worsening of symptoms of the circulation disorder (more intense pain, decreased mobility of the limb and decreased temperature, need for partial or even total limb amputation). The blood viscosity in patients receiving ancrod is progressively reduced by 30 to 40% of the pretreatment levels. The decreased viscosity is directly attributable to lowered fibrinogen levels and leads to important improvements in blood flow and [[perfusion]] of the [[microcirculation]]. [[Erythrocyte]] flexibility is not affected by normal doses of ancrod. The [[rheological]] changes are readily maintained and the viscosity approaches pretreatment values very slowly (within about 10 days) after stopping ancrod. One of the cleavage fibrinogen products, termed 'desAA-Fibrin', acts as [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] for the [[Tissue plasminogen activator|tPA]]-induced [[plasminogen]] activation and an increased [[fibrinolysis]] results in return (profibrinolytic activity of ancrod).

Ancrod decreases the blood viscosity in affected arteries, leads to less intense pain, improves physical limb mobility, and facilitates physical and [[ergo therapy]]. Finally, ancrod decreases the likelihood of local thrombotic events. These mechanisms also account for ancrod's activity in other diseases.

Effects on other [[clotting factors]]: Unlike [[thrombin]], ancrod does not directly activate [[Factor XIII]], nor does it produce [[platelet aggregation]] nor cause the release of [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]], [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[potassium]], or [[serotonin]] from platelets. Platelet counts and survival time remain normal during ancrod therapy.

==Chemistry==
Ancrod was originally isolated from the [[venom]] of the Malayan pit [[Viperidae|viper]] (Agkistrodon rhodostoma, also termed Calloselasma rhodostoma) and is a [[serine protease]].<ref name=Asadi2014rev>{{cite journal|last1=Asadi|first1=H|last2=Yan|first2=B|last3=Dowling|first3=R|last4=Wong|first4=S|last5=Mitchell|first5=P|title=Advances in medical revascularisation treatments in acute ischemic stroke.|journal=Thrombosis|date=2014|volume=2014|pages=714218|pmid=25610642|pmc=4293866}}</ref>

== History ==
Under the brand name Arwin, ancrod was marketed for several decades in [[Germany]] and [[Austria]], until it was withdrawn in the 1980s. Arwin was a brand name of [[Knoll Pharma]].

In 2001 Knoll was acquired by [[Abbott Laboratories]], and in 2002 Abbott licensed the rights to ancrod to Empire Pharmaceuticals, a startup that included a Knoll employee who had worked on ancrod.<ref>{{cite web|title=Form 10-K For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/918112/000119312507200761/d10k.htm|publisher=NTI via SEC Edgar|date=September 13, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Exhibit 10.18 License Agreement between Empire and Abbott, March 29, 2002|url=https://www.lawinsider.com/contracts/3ujCdKUUEBx9HEBd6Dkba7/neurobiological-technologies-inc/918112/2005-09-28|publisher=Law Insider}}</ref> {{rp|5}}  In 2004 Empire was acquired by [[Neurobiological Technologies]].<ref name=PharmaLetter2004>{{cite news|title=Neurobiological Tech buys Empire Pharma|url=http://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/neurobiological-tech-buys-empire-pharma|work=The Pharma Letter|date=July 26, 2004|language=en}}</ref>   NTI also acquired a lot of unpurified venom in the acquisition, and had that purified for use in its clinical trials.<ref name=CNNmoney2006/><ref name=Supply/>

The failure of ancrod in the 6-hour window for ischemic stroke  trial in 2008 led to cuts in staff, an effort to sell of the company's assets, and finally to the dissolution of NTI in August 2009.<ref name=Fierce2008/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Steven E.F.|last2=Leuty|first2=Ron|title=Neurobiological Technologies to dissolve|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2009/08/31/daily9.html|work=San Francisco Business Times|date=August 31, 2009}}</ref>

==Society and culture==
Viprinex is not currently approved or available.

==Research==
For the treatment of established [[deep vein thrombosis]]; central retinal and branch vein thrombosis; [[priapism]]; [[pulmonary hypertension]] of embolic origin; [[embolism]] after insertion of prosthetic [[cardiac valves]]; rethrombosis after thrombolytic therapy and rethrombosis after vascular surgery. It is also indicated for the prevention of deep venous thrombosis after repair of the fractured neck of a femur.

For the treatment of moderate and severe chronic circulatory disorders of peripheral arteries (e.g., [[arteriosclerosis]] obliterans, [[thromboangiitis obliterans]], [[diabetic microangiopathy]] and [[Raynaud's phenomenon]]).

Ancrod has been shown to be useful for maintaining anticoagulation in the presence of [[Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia]] (HIT) and thrombosis.

A small study compared to ancrod to [[heparin]] in preventing [[thrombosis]] when given to people undergoing arterial graft surgery to treat [[peripheral arterial disease]] and found little difference between the two agents.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Geraghty|first1=AJ|last2=Welch|first2=K|title=Antithrombotic agents for preventing thrombosis after infrainguinal arterial bypass surgery.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=15 June 2011|issue=6|pages=CD000536|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000536.pub2|pmid=21678330}}</ref>
