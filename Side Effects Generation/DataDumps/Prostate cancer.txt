==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Diagram showing prostate cancer pressing on the urethra CRUK 182.svg|thumb|right|A diagram of prostate cancer pressing on the urethra, which can cause symptoms.]]
[[File:Prostate Cancer.png|thumb|Prostate cancer]]
Early prostate cancer usually has no clear symptoms. Sometimes, however, prostate cancer does cause symptoms, often similar to those of diseases such as [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]]. These include frequent urination, [[nocturia]] (increased urination at night), difficulty starting and maintaining a steady stream of urine, [[hematuria]] (blood in the urine), and [[dysuria]] (painful urination). A study based on the 1998 Patient Care Evaluation in the US found that about a third of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer had one or more such symptoms, while two-thirds had no symptoms.<ref name=prostateCApresentation />

Prostate cancer is associated with urinary dysfunction as the prostate gland surrounds the [[prostatic urethra]]. Changes within the gland, therefore, directly affect urinary function. Because the ''[[vas deferens]]'' deposits seminal fluid into the prostatic urethra, and secretions from the prostate gland itself are included in semen content, prostate cancer may also cause problems with sexual function and performance, such as difficulty achieving [[erection]] or painful [[ejaculation]].<ref name=prostateCApresentation>{{cite journal |vauthors=Miller DC, Hafez KS, Stewart A, Montie JE, Wei JT | title = Prostate carcinoma presentation, diagnosis, and staging: an update form the National Cancer Data Base | journal = Cancer | volume = 98 | issue = 6 | pages = 1169–78 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 12973840 | doi = 10.1002/cncr.11635 }}</ref>

[[Metastatic]] prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body can cause additional symptoms. The most common symptom is [[bone pain]], often in the [[vertebrae]] (bones of the spine), [[pelvis]], or [[rib]]s. Spread of cancer into other bones such as the [[femur]] is usually to the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal]] or nearby part of the bone. Prostate cancer in the [[vertebral column|spine]] can also compress the [[spinal cord]], causing tingling, leg weakness and [[urinary incontinence|urinary]] and [[fecal incontinence]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=van der Cruijsen-Koeter IW, Vis AN, Roobol MJ, Wildhagen MF, de Koning HJ, van der Kwast TH, Schröder FH | title = Comparison of screen detected and clinically diagnosed prostate cancer in the European randomized study of screening for prostate cancer, section rotterdam | journal = Urol | volume = 174 | issue = 1 | pages = 121–5 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 15947595 | doi = 10.1097/01.ju.0000162061.40533.0f }}</ref>

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Prostatelead.jpg|right|thumb]]
The [[prostate]] is a part of the male [[reproductive system|reproductive]] system that helps make and store [[seminal fluid]]. In adult men, a typical prostate is about 3 centimeters long and weighs about 20 grams.<ref>{{Cite book| last=Aumüller| first=G.| title=Prostate Gland and Seminal Vesicles| publisher=Springer-Verlag| location=Berlin-Heidelberg| year=1979}}</ref> It is located in the [[pelvis]], under the [[urinary bladder]] and in front of the [[rectum]]. The prostate surrounds part of the [[urethra]], the tube that carries [[urine]] from the bladder during [[urination]] and semen during [[ejaculation]].<ref>{{Cite book| last=Moore| first=K.|author2=Dalley, A. | title=Clinically Oriented Anatomy| publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins| location=Baltimore, Maryland| year=1999| isbn=0-683-06132-1}}</ref> Because of its location, prostate diseases often affect urination, ejaculation, and rarely [[defecation]]. The prostate contains many small [[gland]]s which make about 20% of the fluid constituting [[semen]].<ref>{{Cite book| last=Steive| first=H.| chapter=''Männliche Genitalorgane''| title=''Handbuch der mikroskopischen Anatomie des Menschen.'' Vol. VII Part 2| pages=1–399| location=Berlin| publisher=Springer| year=1930}}</ref> In prostate cancer, the cells of these prostate glands [[Mutation|mutate]] into cancer cells. The prostate glands require male [[hormone]]s, known as [[androgen]]s, to work properly. Androgens include [[testosterone]], which is made in the [[testes]]; [[dehydroepiandrosterone]], made in the [[adrenal gland]]s; and [[dihydrotestosterone]], which is converted from testosterone within the prostate itself. Androgens are also responsible for [[secondary sex characteristic]]s such as facial hair and increased muscle mass.

Prostate cancer is classified as an [[adenocarcinoma]], or glandular cancer, that begins when normal semen-secreting prostate gland cells mutate into cancer cells. The region of prostate gland where the adenocarcinoma is most common is the peripheral zone. Initially, small clumps of cancer cells remain confined to otherwise normal prostate glands, a condition known as [[carcinoma in situ]] or [[prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia]] (PIN). Although there is no proof that PIN is a cancer precursor, it is closely associated with cancer. Over time, these cancer cells begin to multiply and spread to the surrounding prostate tissue (the [[stroma (animal tissue)|stroma]]) forming a [[tumor]]. Eventually, the tumor may grow large enough to invade nearby organs such as the [[seminal vesicles]] or the [[rectum]], or the tumor cells may develop the ability to travel in the bloodstream and [[lymphatic system]]. Prostate cancer is considered a [[malignant]] tumor because it is a mass of cells that can invade other parts of the body. This invasion of other organs is called [[metastasis]]. Prostate cancer most commonly metastasizes to the [[bone]]s, [[lymph node]]s, and may invade rectum, [[bladder]] and lower ureters after local progression. The route of metastasis to bone is thought to be venous as the [[prostatic venous plexus]] draining the prostate connects with the vertebral veins.<ref name='metastasis-route'>{{cite web|url=http://www.med-ed.virginia.edu/courses/path/gu/prostate3.cfm |title=Male Genitals - Prostate Neoplasms |accessdate=2011-04-28 |work=Pathology study images |publisher=University of Virginia School of Medicine |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yHQ19Rrp?url=http://www.med-ed.virginia.edu/courses/path/gu/prostate3.cfm |archivedate=2011-04-28 |quote=There are many connections between the prostatic venous plexus and the vertebral veins.

The prostate is a zinc-accumulating, [[citrate]]-producing organ. The protein [[ZIP1]] is responsible for the active transport of zinc into prostate cells. One of the zinc's important roles is to change the metabolism of the cell in order to produce citrate, an important component of semen. The process of zinc accumulation, alteration of metabolism, and citrate production is energy inefficient, and prostate cells sacrifice enormous amounts of energy (ATP) in order to accomplish this task. Prostate cancer cells are generally devoid of zinc. This allows prostate cancer cells to save energy not making citrate, and utilize the new abundance of energy to grow and spread. The absence of zinc is thought to occur via a silencing of the gene that produces the transporter protein ZIP1. ZIP1 is now called a tumor suppressor gene product for the gene [[SLC39A1]]. The cause of the epigenetic silencing is unknown. Strategies which transport zinc into transformed prostate cells effectively eliminate these cells in animals. Zinc inhibits [[NF-κB]] pathways, is anti-proliferative and induces apoptosis in abnormal cells. Unfortunately, oral ingestion of zinc is ineffective since high concentrations of zinc into prostate cells is not possible without the active transporter, ZIP1.<ref>Journal-molecular cancer, review, 2006 5:17, {{doi|10.1186/1476-4598-5-17}}</ref>

Loss of cancer suppressor genes, early in the prostatic carcinogenesis, have been localized to chromosomes'' 8p'', ''10q'', ''13q'', and ''16q''. [[P53]] mutations in the primary prostate cancer are relatively low and are more frequently seen in metastatic settings, hence, [[p53]] mutations are a late event in the pathology of prostate cancer. Other tumor suppressor genes that are thought to play a role in prostate cancer include [[PTEN (gene)]] and [[KAI1]]. "Up to 70 percent of men with prostate cancer have lost one copy of the PTEN gene at the time of diagnosis"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/html/59384.cfm |title=Scientists Discover Anti-Cancer Mechanism that Arrests Early Prostate Cancer |date=August 4, 2005 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519155217/http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/html/59384.cfm |archivedate=May 19, 2008 |df= }}</ref>

The only test that can fully confirm the diagnosis of prostate cancer is a [[biopsy]], the removal of small pieces of the prostate for microscopic examination. However, prior to a biopsy, less invasive testing can be conducted.

There are also several other tests that can be used to gather more information about the prostate and the urinary tract. Digital [[rectal examination]] (DRE) may allow a doctor to detect prostate abnormalities. [[Cystoscopy]] shows the urinary tract from inside the bladder, using a thin, flexible camera tube inserted down the [[urethra]]. [[Transrectal ultrasonography]] creates a picture of the prostate using sound waves from a probe in the rectum.

===Prostate imaging===
Ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the two main imaging methods used for prostate cancer detection. Urologists use transrectal ultrasound during prostate biopsy and can sometimes see a hypoechoic area (tissues or structures that reflect relatively less of the ultrasound waves directed at them). However, US has poor tissue resolution, and thus is generally not used clinically.

Prostate MRI has better soft tissue resolution than ultrasound.<ref name="pmid21571651">{{cite journal |vauthors=Bonekamp D, Jacobs MA, El-Khouli R, Stoianovici D, Macura KJ | title = Advancements in MR Imaging of the Prostate: From Diagnosis to Interventions | journal = Radiographics | volume = 31 | issue = 3 Suppl | pages = 677–703 |date=May–June 2011 | pmid = 21571651 | pmc = 3093638 | doi = 10.1148/rg.313105139 }}</ref>

Prostate MRI is also used for surgical planning for men undergoing robotic prostatectomy. It has also shown to help surgeons decide whether to resect or spare the neurovascular bundle, determine return to urinary continence, and help assess surgical difficulty.<ref name="pmid21993567">{{cite journal |vauthors=Tan N, Margolis DJ, McClure TD, Thomas A, Finley DS, Reiter RE, Huang J, Raman SS | title = Radical prostatectomy: value of prostate MRI in surgical planning | journal = Abdominal Imaging | volume =  37| issue =  4| pages =  664–74|date=October 2011 | pmid = 21993567 | doi = 10.1007/s00261-011-9805-y }}</ref>

For Prostate MRI exists the [[PI-RADS]] Reporting system. PI-RADS is an acronym for Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System, defining standards of high-quality clinical service for multi-parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI), including image creation and reporting.

===Biopsy===

[[File:Prostatic adenocarcinoma with perineural invasion.JPG|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] showing a prostate cancer (conventional adenocarcinoma) with [[perineural invasion]]. [[H&E stain]].]]
If cancer is suspected, a biopsy is offered expediently. During a biopsy a [[urology|urologist]] or [[radiology|radiologist]] obtains tissue samples from the prostate via the rectum. A biopsy gun inserts and removes special hollow-core needles (usually three to six on each side of the prostate) in less than a second. Prostate biopsies are routinely done on an outpatient basis and rarely require hospitalization. Antibiotics should be used to prevent complications like fever, urinary tract infections, and sepsis.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Mohand Yaghi Kehinde EO | year = 2015 | title = Oral antibiotics in trans-rectal prostate biopsy and its efficacy to reduce infectious complications: Systematic review | url = | journal = Urol Ann. | volume = 7 | issue = 4| pages = 417–427 | pmid = 26538868 | pmc=4660689 | doi=10.4103/0974-7796.164860}}</ref> Fifty-five percent of men report discomfort during prostate biopsy.<ref name="pmid9637143">{{cite journal |vauthors=Essink-Bot ML, de Koning HJ, Nijs HG, Kirkels WJ, van der Maas PJ, Schröder FH | title = Short-term effects of population-based screening for prostate cancer on health-related quality of life | journal = J.

====Gleason score====
{{Main article|Gleason score}}
The tissue samples are then examined under a microscope to determine whether cancer cells are present, and to evaluate the microscopic features (or [[Gleason score]]) of any cancer found.

===Staging===
{{Main article|Prostate cancer staging}}
[[File:Diagram showing T1-3 stages of prostate cancer CRUK 278.svg|thumb|Diagram showing T1-3 stages of prostate cancer.]]
An important part of evaluating prostate cancer is determining the [[Cancer staging|stage]], or how far the cancer has spread. Knowing the stage helps define [[prognosis]] and is useful when selecting therapies. The most common system is the four-stage [[TNM staging system|TNM system]] (abbreviated from Tumor/Nodes/Metastases). Its components include the size of the tumor, the number of involved [[lymph node]]s, and the presence of any other [[Metastasis|metastases]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/besttreatments/prostate-cancer-how-far-has-your-cancer-spread-the-tnm-system |title= Prostate cancer: How far has your cancer spread? The TNM system|author=BMJ Group |date=8 December 2009 |work= |publisher=[[Guardian.co.uk]] |accessdate=9 August 2010 |location=London}}</ref>

The most important distinction made by any staging system is whether or not the cancer is still confined to the prostate. In the TNM system, clinical T1 and T2 cancers are found only in the prostate, while T3 and T4 cancers have spread elsewhere. Several tests can be used to look for evidence of spread. [[Specialty (medicine)|Medical specialty]] [[professional organizations]] recommend against the use of [[Positron emission tomography|PET scans]], [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scans]], or [[Bone scintigraphy|bone scans]] when a physician stages early prostate cancer with low risk for metastasis.<ref name="ASCOfive">{{cite journal |author=[[American Society of Clinical Oncology]] |title=Five things physicians and patients should question |journal=The Journal of the Oklahoma State Medical Association |volume=106 |issue=4 |pages=150–1 |year=2013 |pmid=23795527 |doi= |url=http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Clin_Onc.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731073425/http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Clin_Onc.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-31 |df= }}

Bone scans should reveal [[osteoblast]]ic appearance due to ''increased'' bone density in the areas of [[bone metastasis]]—opposite to what is found in many other cancers that metastasize.

After a prostate biopsy, a [[pathology|pathologist]] looks at the samples under a microscope. If cancer is present, the pathologist reports the [[Grading (tumors)|grade]] of the tumor. The grade tells how much the tumor tissue differs from normal prostate tissue and suggests how fast the tumor is likely to grow. The Gleason system is used to grade prostate tumors from 2 to 10, where a [[Gleason score]] of 10 indicates the most abnormalities. The pathologist assigns a number from 1 to 5 for the most common pattern observed under the microscope, then does the same for the second-most-common pattern. The sum of these two numbers is the Gleason score. The [[Whitmore-Jewett stage]] is another method sometimes used.

==Management==
{{Main article|Management of prostate cancer}}
The first decision to be made in managing prostate cancer is whether treatment is needed. Prostate cancer, especially low-grade forms found in elderly men, often grows so slowly that no treatment is required.<ref>{{cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/22/health/cancer-by-any-other-name-would-not-be-as-terrifying.html| title = ‘Cancer’ or ‘Weird Cells’: Which Sounds Deadlier?| author = Kolata, Gina| date = 21 November 2011| newspaper = The New York Times| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170330231028/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/22/health/cancer-by-any-other-name-would-not-be-as-terrifying.html| archivedate = 30 March 2017| df = }}</ref> Treatment may also be inappropriate if a person has other serious health problems or is not expected to live long enough for symptoms to appear.

Which option is best depends on the stage of the disease, the Gleason score, and the PSA level. Other important factors are age, general health, and a person's views about potential treatments and their possible side effects. Because most treatments can have significant [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effect]]s, such as [[erectile dysfunction]] and [[urinary incontinence]], treatment discussions often focus on balancing the goals of therapy with the risks of lifestyle alterations.

===Surveillance===
Many men diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer are eligible for ''active surveillance''. This term implies careful observation of the tumor over time, with the intention of treatment for a cure if there are signs of cancer progression. Active surveillance is ''not'' synonymous with [[watchful waiting]], an older term which implies no treatment or specific program of monitoring, with the assumption that ''palliative'', not curative, treatment would be used if advanced, symptomatic disease develops.

Active surveillance involves monitoring the tumor for signs of growth or the appearance of symptoms. The monitoring process may involve serial PSA, physical examination of the prostate, and/or repeated biopsies. The goal of surveillance is to avoid [[overtreatment]] and the sometimes serious, permanent side effects of treatment for a slow-growing or self-limited tumor that would never cause any problems for the person. This approach is not used for aggressive cancers, but it may cause [[anxiety]] for people who wrongly believe that all cancer is deadly or themselves to have life-threatening cancer. For 50% to 75% of people with prostate cancer it will cause no harm before a person dies from other causes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/ncicancerbulletin/041911/page2 |title=Active Surveillance May Be Preferred Option in Some Men with Prostate Cancer |publisher=Cancer.gov |date=2011-04-19 |accessdate=2011-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503081607/http://www.cancer.gov/ncicancerbulletin/041911/page2 |archivedate=2011-05-03 |df= }}</ref>

===Aggressive cancer===
Treatment of aggressive prostate cancers may involve [[surgery]] (i.e. radical prostatectomy), [[radiation therapy]] including [[brachytherapy]] ([[prostate brachytherapy]]) and external beam radiation therapy, [[high-intensity focused ultrasound]] (HIFU), [[chemotherapy]], oral chemotherapeutic drugs (Temozolomide/TMZ), [[cryosurgery]], [[Hormonal therapy (oncology)|hormonal therapy]], or some combination.<ref name="pmid19946787">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hong H, Zhang Y, Sun J, Cai W | title = Positron emission tomography imaging of prostate cancer | journal = Amino Acids | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–27 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19946787 | pmc = 2883014 | doi = 10.1007/s00726-009-0394-9 }}</ref><ref name="pmid19945663">{{cite journal |vauthors=Peyromaure M, Valéri A, Rebillard X, Beuzeboc P, Richaud P, Soulié M, Salomon L | title = [Characteristics of prostate cancer in men less than 50-year-old] | language = French | journal = Prog.

Although the widespread use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in the US has resulted in diagnosis at earlier age and cancer stage, the vast majority of cases are still diagnosed in men older than 65 years, and approximately 25% of cases are diagnosed in men older than 75 years.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Fitzpatrick JM | title = Management of localized prostate cancer in senior adults: the crucial role of comorbidity | journal = BJU international | volume = 101 Suppl 2 | issue =  | pages = 16–22 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18307688 | doi = 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2007.07487.x }}</ref> Though US National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend using life expectancy greater than or less than 10 years to help make treatment decisions, in practice, many elderly patients are not offered curative treatment options such as radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy and are instead treated with hormonal therapy or watchful waiting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nccn.org/index.asp |title=Evidence-Based Cancer Guidelines, Oncology Drug Compendium, Oncology Continuing Medical Education |publisher=NCCN |accessdate=2011-08-29}}</ref> This pattern can be attributed to factors such as medical co-morbidity and patient preferences is regard to quality of life in addition to prostate cancer specific risk factors such as pretreatment PSA, Gleason score and clinical stage. As the average life expectancy increases due to advances in the treatment of cardiovascular, pulmonary and other chronic diseases, it is likely that more elderly patients will be living long enough to suffer the consequences of their prostate cancer. Therefore, there is currently much interest in the role of aggressive prostate cancer treatment modalities such as with surgery or radiation in the elderly population who have localized disease.

If the cancer has spread beyond the prostate, treatment options significantly change, so most doctors that treat prostate cancer use a variety of [[nomogram]]s to predict the probability of spread. Treatment by watchful waiting/active surveillance, external beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, cryosurgery, HIFU, and surgery are, in general, offered to men whose cancer remains within the prostate. [[Hormonal therapy (oncology)|Hormonal therapy]] and chemotherapy are often reserved for disease that has spread beyond the prostate. However, there are exceptions: radiation therapy may be used for some advanced tumors, and [[Hormonal therapy (oncology)|hormonal therapy]] is used for some early stage tumors. [[Cryotherapy]] (the process of freezing the tumor), [[Hormonal therapy (oncology)|hormonal therapy]], and chemotherapy may also be offered if initial treatment fails and the cancer progresses.

[[Sipuleucel-T]], a [[cancer vaccine]] has been found to result in a benefit (a four-month increase in survival) for men with metastatic prostate cancer.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hammerstrom AE, Cauley DH, Atkinson BJ, Sharma P | title = Cancer immunotherapy: sipuleucel-T and beyond | journal = Pharmacotherapy | volume = 31 | issue = 8 | pages = 813–28 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21923608 | doi = 10.1592/phco.31.8.813 }}</ref>

===Castration-resistant===
{{main article|Castration-resistant prostate cancer}}
Most hormone dependent cancers become [[Disease#Stages|resistant to treatment]] after one to three years and resume growth despite hormone therapy. Previously considered "hormone-refractory prostate cancer" or "androgen-independent prostate cancer", the term castration-resistant has replaced "hormone refractory" because while they are no longer responsive to castration treatment (reduction of available [[androgen]]/[[testosterone]]/[[Dihydrotestosterone|DHT]] by chemical or surgical means), these cancers still show reliance upon hormones for [[androgen receptor]] activation.<ref name="pmid20859283">{{cite journal |vauthors=Seruga B, Ocana A, Tannock IF | title = Drug resistance in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer | journal = Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–23 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 20859283 | doi = 10.1038/nrclinonc.2010.136 }}</ref>

=== Palliative care ===

[[Palliative care]] is medical care which focuses on treatment of symptoms of serious illness, like cancer, and improving quality of life.<ref>{{cite web|title=Palliative or Supportive Care|url=http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/palliativecare/index|publisher=American Cancer Society|accessdate=20 August 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821054618/http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/palliativecare/index|archivedate=21 August 2014|df=}}</ref> One of the goals of treatment in palliative care is symptom control rather than a cure of the underlying cancer. Pain is common in metastatic prostate cancer, and cancer pain related to bone metastases can be treated with [[bisphosphonate]]s, medications such as [[opioid]]s, and palliative [[radiation therapy]] to known metastases. Spinal cord compression can occur with metastases to the spine and can be treated with [[steroid]]s, surgery, or radiation therapy. Other symptoms that can be addressed through palliative care include fatigue, [[delirium]], [[lymphedema]] in the scrotum or penis, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=JC|last2=Wood|first2=J|last3=Feuer|first3=D|title=Prostate cancer: palliative care and pain relief.|journal=British medical bulletin|date=2007|volume=83|pages=341–54|pmid=17628024|doi=10.1093/bmb/ldm018}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
Prostate cancer rates are higher in developed countries than in the rest of the world. Many of the risk factors for prostate cancer are more common including longer life expectancy and diets high in red meat. Also, where there is more access to screening programs, there is a higher detection rate.

In the United States, prostate cancer that is local or regional at the time of diagnosis has a [[5-year survival rate]] of nearly 100%, while those with distant metastases have a 5-year survival rate of 29%.<ref name=SEER2017>{{cite web|title=Cancer of the Prostate - Cancer Stat Facts|url=https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/prost.html|website=seer.cancer.gov|accessdate=11 April 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318055053/https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/prost.html|archivedate=18 March 2017|df=}}</ref> In Japan, death from prostate cancer was one-fifth to one-half the rates in the United States and Europe in the 1990s.<ref name="pmid15714967">{{cite journal | author = Wakai K | title = [Descriptive epidemiology of prostate cancer in Japan and Western countries] | language = Japanese | journal = Nippon Rinsho | volume = 63 | issue = 2 | pages = 207–12 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15714967 | doi =  }}</ref> In [[India]] in the 1990s, half of the people with prostate cancer confined to the prostate died within 19 years.<ref name="pmid1259345">{{cite journal |vauthors=Jaubert de Beaujeu M, Chavrier Y | title = [Deformations of the anterior thoracic wall (author's transl)] | language = French | journal = Ann Chir Thorac Cardiovasc | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–6 | date = January 1976 | pmid = 1259345 | doi =  }}</ref> African-American men have 50–60 times more prostate cancer and prostate cancer deaths than men in Shanghai, China.<ref name="pmid10585584">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hsing AW, Tsao L, Devesa SS | title = International trends and patterns of prostate cancer incidence and mortality | journal = Int.

In patients who undergo treatment, the most important clinical prognostic indicators of disease outcome are the stage, pretherapy PSA level, and Gleason score. In general, the higher the grade and the stage, the poorer the prognosis. [[Nomogram]]s can be used to calculate the estimated risk of the individual patient.

===Classification systems===
[[File:Prostate cancer with Gleason pattern 4 low mag.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] of prostate [[adenocarcinoma]], acinar type, the most common type of prostate cancer. Needle [[biopsy]], [[H&E stain]]]]
Many prostate cancers are not destined to be lethal, and most men will ultimately not die as a result of the disease. Decisions about treatment type and timing may, therefore, be informed by an estimation of the risk that the tumor will ultimately recur after treatment and/or progress to metastases and mortality. Several tools are available to help predict outcomes, such as pathologic stage and recurrence after surgery or radiation therapy. Most combine stage, grade, and PSA level, and some also add the number or percentage of biopsy cores positive, age, and/or other information.

*The ''D'Amico classification'' stratifies men by low, intermediate, or high risk based on stage, grade, and PSA. It is used widely in clinical practice and research settings. The major downside to the 3-level system is that it does not account for multiple adverse parameters (e.g., high Gleason score ''and'' high PSA) in stratifying patients.

*The ''Kattan nomograms'' predict recurrence after surgery and/or radiation therapy, based on data available either at the time of diagnosis or after surgery. The nomograms can be calculated using paper graphs or software available on a website or for handheld computers. The Kattan score represents the likelihood of remaining free of disease at a given time interval following treatment.
*The UCSF ''Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score'' predicts both pathologic status and recurrence after surgery. It offers comparable accuracy as the Kattan preoperative nomogram and can be calculated without paper tables or a calculator. Points are assigned based on PSA, Grade, stage, age, and percentage of cores positive; the sum yields a 0–10 score, with every 2 points representing roughly a doubling of risk of recurrence.

===Life expectancy===
Life expectancy projections are averages for an entire male population, and many medical and lifestyle factors modify these numbers. For example, studies have shown that a 40-year-old man will lose 3.1 years of life if he is overweight (BMI 25-29) and 5.8 years of life if he is obese (BMI 30 or more), compared to men of normal weight. If he is both overweight and a smoker, he will lose 6.7 years, and if obese and a smoker, he will lose 13.7 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/prostate.htm|title=CDC FastStats|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728022146/https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/prostate.htm|archivedate=2017-07-28|df=}}</ref>

At this time, there is no evidence that either surgery or beam radiation has an advantage over the other in this regard, the lower death rates reported with surgery appear to occur because surgery is more likely to be offered to younger men with less serious forms of cancer. Insufficient information is available to determine whether seed radiation extends life more readily than the other treatments, but data so far do not suggest that it does.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/publications/patient-education/understanding-prostate-cancer-treatment|title=Treatment Choices for Men With Early-Stage Prostate Cancer|publisher=National Cancer Institute|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404184205/http://www.cancer.gov/publications/patient-education/understanding-prostate-cancer-treatment|archivedate=2015-04-04|df=}}</ref>

People with low-grade disease (Gleason 2-4) were unlikely to die of prostate cancer within 15 years of diagnosis. Older men (age 70-75) with low-grade disease had an approximately 20% overall survival at 15 years due to deaths from competing causes. Men with high-grade disease (Gleason 8-10) experienced high prostate cancer mortality within 15 years of diagnosis, regardless of their age at diagnosis, underscoring the very aggressive nature of poorly differentiated prostate cancer.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=25849602 | doi=10.1016/j.juro.2015.01.126 | title=Gleason 6 Prostate Cancer: Translating Biology into Population Health. | date=Apr 2015 | journal=J Urol | volume=194 | pages=626–634 | pmc=4551510 | author=Eggener SE, Badani K, Barocas DA, Barrisford GW, Cheng JS, Chin AI, Corcoran A, Epstein JI, George AK, Gupta GN, Hayn MH, Kauffman EC, Lane B, Liss MA, Mirza M, Morgan TM, Moses K, Nepple KG, Preston MA, Rais-Bahrami S, Resnick MJ, Siddiqui MM, Silberstein J, Singer EA, Sonn GA, Sprenkle P, Stratton KL, Taylor J, Tomaszewski J, Tollefson M, Vickers A, White WM, Lowrance WT}}</ref>

==History==
Although the prostate was first described by [[Venice|Venetian]] anatomist [[Niccolò Massa]] in 1536, and illustrated by [[Flanders|Flemish]] anatomist [[Vesalius|Andreas Vesalius]] in 1538, prostate cancer was not identified until 1853.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Adams J | title = The case of scirrhous of the prostate gland with corresponding affliction of the lymphatic glands in the lumbar region and in the pelvis | journal = Lancet | volume = 1 | issue = 1547 | pages = 393–394 | year = 1853 | pmid =  | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)68759-8 }}</ref> Prostate cancer was initially considered a rare disease, probably because of shorter [[life expectancy|life expectancies]] and poorer detection methods in the 19th century. The first treatments of prostate cancer were surgeries to relieve urinary obstruction.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lytton B | title = Prostate cancer: a brief history and the discovery of hormonal ablation treatment | journal = The Journal of Urology | volume = 165 | issue = 6 Pt 1 | pages = 1859–62 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11371867 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-5347(05)66228-3 }}</ref> Removal of the entire gland (radical perineal [[prostatectomy]]) was first performed in 1904 by [[Hugh H.

[[Transurethral resection of the prostate]] (TURP) replaced radical prostatectomy for symptomatic relief of obstruction in the middle of the 20th century because it could better preserve penile erectile function. Radical retropubic prostatectomy was developed in 1983 by Patrick Walsh.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Walsh PC, Lepor H, Eggleston JC | title = Radical prostatectomy with preservation of sexual function: anatomical and pathological considerations | journal = The Prostate | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 473–85 | year = 1983 | pmid = 6889192 | doi = 10.1002/pros.2990040506 }}</ref> This surgical approach allowed for removal of the prostate and lymph nodes with maintenance of penile function.

In 1941, [[Charles B. Huggins]] published studies in which he used [[estrogen]] to oppose testosterone production in men with metastatic prostate cancer.

[[Radiation therapy]] for prostate cancer was first developed in the early 20th century and initially consisted of intraprostatic [[radium]] implants.

Systemic [[chemotherapy]] for prostate cancer was first studied in the 1970s. The initial regimen of [[cyclophosphamide]] and [[5-fluorouracil]] was quickly joined by multiple regimens using a host of other systemic chemotherapy drugs.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Scott WW, Johnson DE, Schmidt JE, Gibbons RP, Prout GR, Joiner JR, Saroff J, Murphy GP | title = Chemotherapy of advanced prostatic carcinoma with cyclophosphamide or 5-fluorouracil: results of first national randomized study | journal = The Journal of Urology | volume = 114 | issue = 6 | pages = 909–11 | date = December 1975 | pmid = 1104900 | doi =  }}</ref>

===Cell-of-origin===
A series of studies published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' involved introduced viruses known to cause cancerous mutation in prostate cells: AKT, ERG, and AR into isolated samples of [[Stratum germinativum|basal]] and luminal cells and grafted the treated tissue into mice. After 16 weeks, none of the luminal samples had undergone malignant mutation, while the basal samples had mutated into prostate-like tubules which had then developed malignancy and formed cancerous tumors, which appeared identical to human samples under magnification. This led to the conclusion that the prostate [[basal cell]] may be the most likely "site of origin" of prostate cancer.<ref name="pmid20671189">{{cite journal |vauthors=Goldstein AS, Huang J, Guo C, Garraway IP, Witte ON | title = Identification of a cell of origin for human prostate cancer | journal = Science | volume = 329 | issue = 5991 | pages = 568–71 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20671189 | pmc = 2917982 | doi = 10.1126/science.1189992 }}</ref>

Disparities also extend into areas such as detection, with governments failing to fund or mandate prostate cancer screening while fully supporting breast cancer programs.

[[Alpharadin]] completed a phase 3 trial for CRPC patients with bone metastasis. A pre-planned interim analysis showed improved survival and quality of life. The study was stopped for ethical reasons to give the placebo group the same treatment. Alpharadin uses bone targeted Radium-223 isotopes to kill cancer cells by alpha radiation.<ref name="urlAlgeta.com">{{cite web | url = http://algeta.com/xml_press_underside.asp?xml=http://cws.huginonline.com/A/134655/PR/201106/1521246.xml&m=34572&s=34686&ss=&d=2011-06-06 | title = Positive Outcome of Interim Analysis of pivotal Alpharadin study: Primary endpoint met in Phase III ALSYMPCA study | date = 2011-06-06 | work = Press Release | publisher = Algeta.com | accessdate = 2011-07-04 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110811081805/http://algeta.com/xml_press_underside.asp?xml=http%3A%2F%2Fcws.huginonline.com%2FA%2F134655%2FPR%2F201106%2F1521246.xml&m=34572&s=34686&ss=&d=2011-06-06 | archivedate = 2011-08-11 | df =  }}</ref> It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on May, 15th 2013 ahead of schedule under the priority review program.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm352363.htm|title=FDA approves new drug for advanced prostate cancer|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|date=15 May 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604012752/http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm352363.htm|archivedate=4 June 2013|df=}}</ref> Alpharadin still waits for approval by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

Hence, 5-LOX inhibitors have been targeted for their chemopreventive effects. Inhibition of 5-LOX activity is shown to block prostate cancer cell proliferation as well as carcinogen-induced lung tumorigenesis (119, 120).&nbsp;... Both 5-HETE and 12-HETE are also products of lipoxygenase and are involved in tumor progression (12). Exogenous 5-HETE can stimulate the proliferation of prostate cancer cells and act as a survival factor (137, 138). These results require relatively high concentrations (at a concentration of 10 μM). Blocking the formation of 5-HETE, by inhibiting 5-lipoxygenase, results in massive apoptosis of human prostate cancer cells (139).}}</ref><ref name="MEDRS review 2">{{cite journal |vauthors=Bishayee K, Khuda-Bukhsh AR | title = 5-lipoxygenase antagonist therapy: a new approach towards targeted cancer chemotherapy | journal = Acta Biochim.

Recent studies with 5-LOX siRNA [10] and specific blocker of 5-LOX [24] revealed the relation of this gene with the tumor cell proliferation.&nbsp;... Meclofenamate sodium (MS) is known for its anti-inflammatory activity, and apart from this, Boctor et al. [37] reported that it caused reduction in the formation of 5-HETE in human leucocytes when used. MS can thus be considered a dual inhibitor of 5-LOX and COX pathways of arachidonic acid cascade. Further investigation with this substance revealed that it could interfere with the LT receptors in the lung carcinoma [38]. In a recent study, a group of scientists have shown the effect of MS on prostate cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo [39], and their result suggests a profound reduction in the tumor growth and cancer metastasis.&nbsp;... While the commonly used inhibitors produced strong cytotoxicity, notably, zileuton, the only commercialized 5-LOX inhibitor, failed to induce an anti-proliferative or cytotoxic response in all other types of tumor cells where 5-LOX was in inactive state (e.g. HeLa cells); however, where 5-LOX was in active state, zileuton could effectively inhibit progression, as in case of prostate cancer.}}</ref> In particular, [[arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors]] produce massive, rapid programmed cell death in prostate cancer cells.<ref name="Primary source cited in 1st review" /><ref name="MEDRS review 1" /><ref name="MEDRS review 2" />

===Cancer models===
Scientists have established a few prostate cancer [[cell lines]] to investigate the mechanism involved in the progression of prostate cancer. [[LNCaP]], PC-3 ([[PC3]]), and DU-145 ([[DU145]]) are commonly used prostate cancer cell lines. The LNCaP cancer cell line was established from a human lymph node metastatic lesion of prostatic adenocarcinoma. PC-3 and DU-145 cells were established from human prostatic adenocarcinoma metastatic to bone and to brain, respectively. LNCaP cells express [[androgen receptor]] (AR); however, PC-3 and DU-145 cells express very little or no AR. AR, an androgen-activated [[transcription factor]], belongs to the steroid [[nuclear receptor]] family. Development of the prostate is dependent on androgen signaling mediated through AR, and AR is also important during the development of prostate cancer. The proliferation of LNCaP cells is [[androgen]]-dependent but the proliferation of PC-3 and DU-145 cells is [[androgen]]-insensitive. Elevation of AR expression is often observed in advanced prostate [[tumor]]s in patients.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Linja MJ, Savinainen KJ, Saramäki OR, Tammela TL, Vessella RL, Visakorpi T | title = Amplification and overexpression of androgen receptor gene in hormone-refractory prostate cancer | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 61 | issue = 9 | pages = 3550–5 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 11325816 | doi =  | url = http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11325816 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ford OH, Gregory CW, Kim D, Smitherman AB, Mohler JL | title = Androgen receptor gene amplification and protein expression in recurrent prostate cancer | journal = The Journal of Urology | volume = 170 | issue = 5 | pages = 1817–21 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14532783 | doi = 10.1097/01.ju.0000091873.09677.f4 }}</ref> Some androgen-independent LNCaP sublines have been developed from the ATCC androgen-dependent LNCaP cells after androgen deprivation for study of prostate cancer progression.

===Diagnosis===
At present, an active area of research and non-clinically applied investigations involve non-invasive methods of prostate tumor detection.

A molecular test that detects the presence of cell-associated [[PCA3]] mRNA in fluid massaged from the prostate by the doctor and first-void urinated out has also been under investigation. PCA3 mRNA is expressed almost exclusively by prostate cells and has been shown to be highly over-expressed in prostate cancer cells. The test result is currently reported as a specimen ratio of PCA3 mRNA to PSA mRNA. Although not a replacement for serum PSA level, the PCA3 test is an additional tool to help decide whether, in men suspected of having prostate cancer (especially if an initial biopsy fails to explain the elevated serum PSA), a biopsy/rebiopsy is really needed. The higher the expression of PCA3 in the sample, the greater the likelihood of a positive biopsy; i.e., the presence of cancer cells in the prostate.<ref name="pmid21176272">{{cite journal |vauthors=Bourdoumis A, Papatsoris AG, Chrisofos M, Efstathiou E, Skolarikos A, Deliveliotis C | title = The novel prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) biomarker | journal = Int Braz J Urol | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 665–8; discussion 669 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21176272 | doi = 10.1590/S1677-55382010000600003 }}</ref>
