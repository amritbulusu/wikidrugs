<!-- History, society and culture -->
Oxcarbazepine is marketed as '''Trileptal''' by [[Novartis]] and available in some countries as a generic drug.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|title = Trileptal® (oxcarbazepine) tablets and oral suspension|url = http://www.pharma.us.novartis.com/info/products/brands/Trileptal.jsp|website = www.pharma.us.novartis.com|accessdate = 2015-11-11}}</ref> There is also an extended-release formulation marketed as '''Oxtellar XR''' by Supernus Pharmaceuticals.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Neurology Portfolio {{!}} Supernus Pharmaceuticals|url = https://www.supernus.com/neurology-portfolio|website = www.supernus.com|accessdate = 2015-11-11}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
Oxcarbazepine is an anticonvulsant used to reduce the occurrence of epileptic episodes, and is not intended to cure epilepsy.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|title = Oxcarbazepine (By mouth) - National Library of Medicine - PubMed Health|url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0011528/?report=details|website = mmdn/DNX1023|accessdate = 2015-11-02|first = National Center for Biotechnology|last = Information|first2 = U.

In addition, oxcarbazepine has been shown to improve mood and reduce [[anxiety]]; therefore, it is a potential option for add-on therapy in the treatment of bipolar disorder.<ref name="Mazza_2007" /><ref name=":2" />

=== Pregnancy ===
Oxcarbazepine is listed as Pregnancy Category C.<ref name=":3" />

Currently, there is limited data analyzing the impact of oxcarbazepine on a human fetus.<ref name=":3" /> Animal studies have shown an increased incidence of fetal abnormalities in pregnant rats and rabbits treated with oxcarbazepine, during pregnancy.<ref name=":3" /> In addition, oxcarbazepine is structurally similar to carbamazepine (pregnancy category: D) which is considered to be [[Teratology|teratogenic]] in humans.<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite web|title = DailyMed - CARBAMAZEPINE- carbamazepine tablet  CARBAMAZEPINE- carbamazepine tablet, chewable|url = http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=c13bc0b8-7900-4ef4-98ed-e1315a08d95d|website = dailymed.nlm.nih.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-12}}</ref> Oxcarbazepine should only be used in pregnancy if the benefits justify the risks.<ref name=":3" />

Pregnant persons on oxcarbazepine should be closely monitored, as plasma levels of the active metabolite (MHD) has been shown to potentially decrease during pregnancy.<ref name=":3" />

===Nursing mothers===
Oxcarbazepine and MHD are both present in human breast milk and thus, some of the active drug can be transferred to a nursing infant.<ref name=":3" /> When considering whether to continue this medication in nursing mothers, the impact of the drug's side effect profile on the infant, should be weighed against its anti-epileptic benefit for the mother.<ref name=":3" />

==Side effects==
The most common side effects associated with oxcarbazepine include:<ref name=":3" />
* dizziness  (6.4%)
* blurred or double vision (2.1%)
* fatigue  (2.1%)
* headaches (2.9%)
* nausea (4.9%) 
* vomiting (2%)
* sleepiness (2.4%) 
* there is evidence of difficulty in concentration and mental sluggishness

Other rare side effects of oxcarbazepine include:<ref name=":3" />
* severe [[hyponatremia|low blood sodium]] (1%) 
* anaphylaxis / angioedema 
* hypersensitivity (especially if experienced with [[carbamazepine]] previously [25-30% cross-reactivity])
* [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]] (TEN, 0.5 to 6 cases per million-person years)
* [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]] (SJS, 0.5 to 6 cases per million-person years)
* thoughts of suicide (<1%)

Measurement of serum sodium levels should be considered in maintenance treatment or if symptoms of hyponatremia develop.<ref name=":3" /> Some side effects (such as headache) are more pronounced shortly after a dose is taken and tend to fade with the passage of time (60 to 90 minutes). Other side effects include stomach pain, tremor, rash, diarrhea, constipation, decreased appetite and dry mouth. Photosensitivity is a potential side-effect and people could experience severe [[sunburn]]s as a result of sun exposure.<ref name=":3" />

== Interactions ==
Oxcarbazepine and its active metabolite (monohydroxy derivative; MHD) have been shown to exhibit drug interactions when indicated with medications that are metabolized via [[CYP2C19]], [[CYP3A4]] and [[CYP3A5]].<ref name=":3" /> Oxcarbazepine and MHD is a potent inhibitor of [[CYP2C19]] and thus, has the potential to increase plasma concentration of drugs that are metabolized through this pathway placing the patient at higher risk for toxicities.<ref name=":3" /> Example of CYP2C19 substrates include: [[phenytoin]], [[citalopram]], [[diazepam]], [[imipramine]], [[omeprazole]], [[propranolol]], [[amitriptyline]] and [[progesterone]] when administered together.<ref name=":3" />

In addition, oxcarbazepine and MHD are [[CYP3A4]] and [[CYP3A5]] inducers and thus, have the potential to decrease the plasma concentration and therapeutic efficacy of medications that are CYP3A substrates.<ref name=":3" /> Examples of CYP3A4 substrates include [[dihydropyridine]] [[Calcium channel blocker|calcium channel antagonist]] and [[Oral contraceptive pill|oral contraceptives]].<ref name=":3" /> Due to the increase in drug metabolism of CYP3A4 substrates, hormonal contraceptives might be less effective, placing females at a greater risk of pregnancy.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":5" />

Furthermore, oxcarbazepine has been shown to interact with other anticonvulsant medications when used in combination.<ref name=":3" /> For example, phenytoin and [[phenobarbital]] are known CYP inducers and thus, have the potential to decrease the plasma concentration of oxcarbazepine's active metabolite, MHD.<ref name=":3" />

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Oxcarbazepine has great [[bioavailability]] once it is administrated orally as tablets.<ref name=":3" /> Upon absorption, oxcarbazepine is largely metabolized to its pharmacologically active 10-monohydroxy metabolite [[licarbazepine]] (sometimes called ''MHD'').<ref name=":3" /> During a study in humans, the unchanged oxcarbazepine was found to be about 2% of the total radioactivity, while licarbazepine presented 70%, and the rest representing the minor metabolites.<ref name=":3" /> The [[half-life]] of oxcarbazepine is considered to be about 2 hours, whereas licarbazepine has a half-life of nine hours. Therefore, the antiepileptic activity can be attributed to licarbazepine.<ref name=":3" />

== Pharmacodynamics ==
Both oxcarbazepine and its MHD the active metabolite  were found to show anticonvulsant properties in seizure models done on animals.<ref name=":3" /> These compounds had protective functions whenever tonic extension seizures were induced electrically, but such protection was less apparent whenever seizures were induced chemically.<ref name=":3" /> There was no observable tolerance during  a four weeks course of treatment with daily administration of oxcarbazepine or MHD in electroshock test on mice and rats.<ref name=":3" />

== Pharmacology ==
Oxcarbazepine and MHD exert their action by blocking voltage-sensitive sodium channels, thus leading to the stabilization of hyper excited neural membranes, suppression of repetitive neuronal firing and diminishment propagation of synaptic impulses.<ref name=":3" /> Furthermore, anticonvulsant effects of these compounds could be attributed to enhanced potassium conductance and modulation of high-voltage activated calcium channels.<ref name=":3" />

== Pharmacogenetics ==
[[File:Trileptal Oral Suspension 100mg per ml.JPG|thumb|Trileptal (oxcarbazepine), oral suspension 100 mg/ml]]
Since the structure of oxcarbazepine is similar to carbamazepine, there is a consideration for genetic testing in patients who are of Asian descent (mainly populations of Han Chinese (2–12%), Thai (8%), Philippines (15%), Malaysia) due to the higher frequency of the HLA-B*1502 [[allele]].<ref name=":3" />  [[Human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA) allele B*1502 has been associated with an increased incidence of [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]] and [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]].<ref name=":3" />

==Structure pharmacology==
Oxcarbazepine is a structural derivative of [[carbamazepine]], with a [[ketone]] in place of the [[carbon–carbon double bond]] on the [[dibenzazepine]] ring at the 10 position (10-keto). This difference helps reduce the impact on the [[liver]] of [[drug metabolism|metabolizing]] the drug, and also prevents the serious forms of [[anemia]] or [[agranulocytosis]] occasionally associated with [[carbamazepine]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Aside from this reduction in side effects, it is thought to have the same mechanism as carbamazepine — [[sodium channel]] inhibition (presumed to be the main mechanism of action) – and is generally used to treat the same conditions.

Oxcarbazepine is a [[prodrug]] which is activated to [[licarbazepine]] in the liver.<ref name="Dulsat">{{cite journal
