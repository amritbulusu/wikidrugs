'''Reteplase''' (trade names '''Retavase''', '''Rapilysin''') is a [[thrombolytic drug]], used to treat [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]] by breaking up the [[clot]]s that cause them.

Reteplase is a recombinant non-glycosylated form of human [[tissue plasminogen activator]], which has been modified to contain 357 of the 527 [[amino acid]]s of the original [[protein]]. It is produced in the [[bacterium]] [[Escherichia coli]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Reteplase is similar to recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator ([[alteplase]]), but the modifications give reteplase a longer [[half-life]] of 13–16 minutes.  Reteplase also binds [[fibrin]] with lower affinity than alteplase, improving its ability to penetrate into clots.

Reteplase was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] in 1996.

As reteplase  is able to penetrate inside the thrombi, an enhanced fibrinolytic activity will be achieved → rapid reperfusion → low incidence of bleeding.
