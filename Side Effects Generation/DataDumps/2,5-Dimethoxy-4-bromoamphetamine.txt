'''Dimethoxybromoamphetamine''' ('''DOB'''), also known as '''brolamfetamine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]])<ref name="Organization2000">{{cite book|author=World Health Organization|title=International Nonproprietary Names (INN) for Pharmaceutical Substances|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HcogPwAACAAJ|year=2000|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=978-0-11-986227-0}}</ref> and '''bromo-DMA''', is a [[psychedelic drug]] and [[substituted amphetamine]] of the [[substituted phenethylamine|phenethylamine]] class of compounds. DOB was first synthesized by [[Alexander Shulgin]] in 1967.<ref name="dob-pihkal">[http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal062.shtml Erowid Online Books : "PiHKAL" - #62 DOB]</ref><ref name=dob1973>{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000136181 |title=4-Bromo-2,5-Dimethoxyphenylisopropylamine, a New Centrally Active Amphetamine Analog}}</ref> Its synthesis and effects are documented in Shulgin's book ''[[PiHKAL|PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story]]''.

==Chemistry==
[[Image:DOB blotters.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Tabs of DOB, confiscated by police in [[Concord, California]] in 2006.]]
The full name of the chemical is 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine. DOB has a [[stereocenter]] and ''R''-(–)-DOB is the [[eutomer]]. This is an important finding as it is suggestive that it is targeting different receptors relative to most other [[phenethylamines]] (e.g. [[MDMA]]) where the ''R''-isomer serves as the [[distomer]]. The toxicity of DOB is not fully known, although high doses may cause serious [[vasoconstriction]] of the extremities. DOB is one of the most potent compounds in PiHKAL; while the active dose is similar to that of [[2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine|DOI]], another psychedelic amphetamine, DOB has been shown to have a higher efficacy in triggering downstream effects mediated by 5-HT2 receptors,<ref name="parrish-2005">Parrish JC, Braden MR, Gundy E & Nichols DE (2005). Differential phospholipase-C activation by phenylalkylamine serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonists. ''J. Neurochem''. 95: 1575-1584.</ref> making it likely to be slightly more dangerous than DOI in overdose, due to greater vasoconstrictive action.  Omission of the amphetamine related α-methyl leads to [[2C-B]], a compound that possesses a lower affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor and is a weaker receptor agonist which results in drastically reduced vasoconstriction.

==Pharmacology==
DOB is a [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]], [[5-HT2B receptor|5-HT<sub>2B</sub>]], and [[5-HT2C receptor|5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor]] [[partial agonist]].<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0009019| pmid = 20126400| pmc = 2814854| title = Psychedelics and the Human Receptorome| journal = PLoS ONE| volume = 5| issue = 2| pages = e9019| year = 2010| last1 = Ray | first1 = T. S. }}</ref> Its psychedelic effects are mediated by its [[agonist]]ic properties at the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor. Due to its selectivity, DOB is often used in scientific research when studying the [[5-HT2|5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor]] subfamily. It is an agonist of human [[TAAR1]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Articleid 50034244 |url=http://www.bindingdb.org/jsp/dbsearch/PrimarySearch_pubmed.jsp?pubmed=50034244&pubmed_submit=TBD|work=Binding Database|accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref>

It has been suggested that DOB is a [[prodrug]] metabolized in the lungs.<ref name="dob-pihkal" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/shulgin/blg/2005/05/dob-and-other-possible-prodrugs.html |title=Ask Dr. Shulgin Online: DOB and Other Possible Prodrugs |accessdate=18 November 2009 |last=Shulgin |date=2005-05-03}}</ref>

==Legal status==

Internationally DOB is a Schedule I drug under the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/green.pdf |title=List of psychotropic substances under international control |accessdate=30 March 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302130637/http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/green.pdf |archivedate=2 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>

===Canada===
Listed as a [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act|Schedule 1]] as it is an analogue of amphetamine.<ref name="CDSA Schedule I: Amphetamines">[http://isomerdesign.com/Cdsa/schedule.php?schedule=3&section=1&structure=C] {{en icon}}</ref>

===Australia===
DOB is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the [[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons|Poisons Standard]] (February 2017).<ref name="Poisons Standard">Poisons Standard October 2015 https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2015L01534</ref> A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.<ref name="Poisons Standard" />
