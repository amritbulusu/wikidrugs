'''Thebacon''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]];<ref>{{cite book | editor= Sean C. Sweetman | title=Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference | edition=36th | year=2009 | publisher=Pharmaceutical Press | location=London | isbn= 0-85369-840-6 }}</ref> pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|θ|iː|b|ə|k|ɒ|n}}), or '''dihydrocodeinone enol acetate''', is a [[semisynthetic]] [[opioid]] that is similar to [[hydrocodone]] and is most commonly synthesised from [[thebaine]]. Thebacon is a derivative of [[acetyldihydrocodeine]], where only the 6-7 [[double bond]] is saturated. Thebacon is marketed as its [[hydrochloride|hydrochloride salt]] under the trade name '''Acedicon''', and as its [[bitartrate]] under '''Diacodin''' and other trade names. The hydrochloride salt has a [[free base]] conversion ratio of 0.846. Other salts used in research and other settings include thebacon's phosphate, hydrobromide, citrate, hydroiodide, and sulphate. The US [[DEA]] Administrative Controlled Substance Control Number assigned by the [[Controlled Substances Act|Controlled Substances Act 1970]] for thebacon and all of its salts is 9737.

Thebacon is an [[opioid]] [[agonist]] [[narcotic]] [[analgesic]] of the middle range and a strong [[antitussive]], primarily used in [[Europe]], although it is no longer in common use. Currently, [[dihydrocodeine]] and [[nicocodeine]] are used as second-line [[codeine]] replacements. Thebacon was invented in [[Germany]] in 1924, four years after the first synthesis of hydrocodone.<ref>Morphine & Allied Drugs, Princeton U Press 1957</ref> The other dihydromorphinone used as an antitussive is hydromorphone (Dilaudid cough syrup); the other narcotic antitussives are either more directly related to codeine or not related at all (open chain [[methadone]] relatives and [[thiambutenes]]).

Thebacon is indicated for moderate to moderately severe pain and dry painful coughing, like hydrocodone. It has a duration of action in the range of 5 to 9 hours and doses typically start at 5&nbsp;mg q6h. The drug is most commonly taken orally as an elixir, tablet, or capsule, although rectal and subcutaneous administration has the same advantages with hydrocodone as would taking a tablet or powder or a liquid concentrate buccally or sublingually.

Thebacon is generated by the [[esterification]] product of the [[enol]] [[tautomer]] of [[hydrocodone]] (dihydrocodeineone) with [[acetic acid]]. Although modification of thebaine is the most common way of making thebacon, it is not uncommonly prepared by refluxing hydrocodone with [[acetic anhydride]], generally similar to how [[diacetylmorphine]] is produced. It is also a product of the [[metabolism]] of hydrocodone by ''[[Pseudomonas putida]] M10'', the bacterium used for oil spill remediation. This also produces a morphinone reductase which can turn morphine into [[hydromorphone]] in a process which produces other active opioids, such as [[oxymorphone]], [[oxymorphol]], or [[hydromorphinol]] as intermediates.

Thebacon's [[analgesic]] and antitussive potency is slightly higher than that of its parent compound [[hydrocodone]], which gives it approximately eight times the milligramme strength of codeine. The acetylation at position 3 and the conversion into a dihydromorphinone class semisynthetic (at position 14 on the morphine carbon skeleton) allows for the drug to more rapidly enter the central nervous system in greater quantity where it is de-acetylated into [[hydromorphone]], and also converted by other processes into [[hydromorphinol]], [[morphine]] and various other active and inactive substances; it therefore simultaneously takes advantage of two methods of increasing the effectiveness of morphine and its derivatives, those being catalytic hydrogenation (codeine into hydrocodone) and esterification (morphine into [[diamorphine]], [[nicomorphine]] &c) in a manner not unlike to that of [[dihydrodiacetylmorphine]].

Like all of its chemical relatives in this class (codeine-based semi-synthetic narcotic antitussives), thebacon exerts its analgesic effect and a large part of its antitussive and antiperistaltic action as a [[prodrug]] for stronger and/or longer-lasting opioids, primarily [[hydromorphone]], which is formed in the liver by the [[CYP2D6|cytochrome P450 2D6]] (CYP2D6) enzyme pathway as well as [[acetylmorphone]]. As a result, the effectiveness of a given dose of thebacon will vary amongst patients, and some food and drugs can affect various parts of the [[ADME|liberation, absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination profile]], and therefore a variable proportion of the potency of thebacon. Thebacon can be said to be the 3-monoacetylmorphine analog of hydrocodone, and/or the [[acetylmorphone]] analog of [[codeine]]. It is also a close structural relative of [[3,14-diacetyloxymorphone]].

For both pain and coughing, thebacon can be made more effective along with [[NSAID]]s, [[muscle relaxants]], and/or [[antihistamines]] like [[tripelennamine]], [[hydroxyzine]], [[promethazine]], [[phenyltoloxamine]] and [[chlorpheniramine]].

Thebacon is a [[Schedule I controlled substance]] in the United States, never having been in medical use there.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.justice.gov/dea/pubs/scheduling.html | title=Controlled Substance Schedules | publisher= US Department of Justice}}</ref>
