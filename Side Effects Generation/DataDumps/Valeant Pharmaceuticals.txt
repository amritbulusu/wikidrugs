'''Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.''' is a [[multinational company|multinational]] specialty [[pharmaceutical company]] based in [[Laval, Quebec]], [[Canada]]. Valeant develops, manufactures, and markets a broad range of pharmaceutical products primarily in the areas of dermatology, gastrointestinal disorders, eye health, neurology, and branded generics. Valeant owns [[Bausch & Lomb]], one of the world's largest suppliers of eye health products.

Valeant grew rapidly with a series of [[mergers and acquisitions]] under the leadership of [[J. Michael Pearson]] and for a short period of time in 2015 was the most valuable company in Canada. Valeant was described as a [[platform company]] that grows by systematically acquiring other companies. The company acquired [[Salix Pharmaceuticals]] for $14.5 billion in 2015. It also tried to acquire [[Actavis]] and [[Cephalon]] and merge with [[Allergan]], but failed.

In 2015, the company was involved in a controversy around drug price hikes and the use of a [[specialty pharmacy]] for the distribution of its [[specialty drugs]], which led to an investigation by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]. The company's stock price then plummeted nearly 90 percent since its peak. Valeant subsequently reversed the price hikes and ended cooperation with specialty pharmacy [[Philidor Rx Services]] and [[Walgreens]] took over distribution.

In May 2016, Pearson was replaced by [[Joseph C. Papa]] as CEO. In March 2017, [[Bill Ackman]]'s [[Pershing Square Capital Management|Pershing Square]] fund, which held a major stake in the company, sold out for a reported loss of $2.8 bn.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ackman sells Valeant stake...|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-13/valeant-falls-as-bill-ackman-sells-out-departs-company-s-board|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=14 March 2017}}</ref> Following Ackman's exit, [[Paulson & Co.]] increased its stake in the company and became its largest shareholder,<ref>{{cite web|title=Valeant: Paulson & Co.

Valeant raised the price of [[Nitropress]] 212% and [[Isuprel]] 525%".<ref name="NYT_2_Oct_2015" /> Much of the criticism relates to price increases Valeant has made to drugs it acquired the rights to through mergers and acquisitions.<ref name="NYT_04_Oct_2015" /> New York Times columnist [[Joe Nocera]] claimed that Valeant CEO [[J. Michael Pearson]]'s "plan was to acquire pharmaceutical companies, fire most of their scientists and jack up the price of their drugs".<ref>{{Cite news|title = Is Valeant Pharmaceuticals the Next Enron?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/27/opinion/is-valeant-pharmaceuticals-the-next-enron.html|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=October 27, 2015|access-date=October 27, 2015|issn=0362-4331|first=Joe|last=Nocera}}</ref>

After Valeant acquired Salix Pharmaceuticals in 2015, it raised the price of the [[diabetes]] pill [[Glumetza]] about 800%.<ref name="globeandmail">{{cite news | title=Regulators circle as Valeant’s business model in focus | publisher=[[Globe and Mail]] | date=October 5, 2015 | accessdate= October 5, 2015}}</ref><ref name="NYT_04_Oct_2015">{{Cite news|title=Valeant’s Drug Price Strategy Enriches It, but Infuriates Patients and Lawmakers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/05/business/valeants-drug-price-strategy-enriches-it-but-infuriates-patients-and-lawmakers.html|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=October 4, 2015|access-date=October 4, 2015|issn=0362-4331|first=Andrew|last=Pollack|first2=Sabrina|last2=Tavernise}}</ref>

A [[New York Times]] article on October 4, 2015<ref name="NYT_04_Oct_2015" /> stated that:
{{quote|"Valeant is known for buying companies and laying off their employees to achieve savings, while accumulating a debt of about $30 billion. It spends an amount equivalent to only 3% of its sales on research and development, which it views as risky and inefficient compared with buying existing drugs. Traditional big drug companies spend 15 to 20% of sales on research and development. Valeant also pays extremely low taxes because it is officially based in Canada, although Mr. Pearson operates from New Jersey."|New York Times October 4, 2015}}

Although it did not specifically mention Valeant, an October 2015 [[Twitter]] post by presidential candidate [[Hillary Clinton]] stated: "Price gouging like this in the specialty drug market is outrageous. Tomorrow I’ll lay out a plan to take it on."<ref name="CNN_money_21_September_2015">{{cite web | url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/09/21/investing/hillary-clinton-biotech-price-gouging/index.html?iid=SF_LN | title=Hillary Clinton tweet crushes biotech stocks | publisher=CNN Money | date=September 21, 2015 | accessdate=October 15, 2015}}</ref> In January 2016, she said she would be "going after" Valeant for its price hikes, causing its stock price to fall 9 percent on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].<ref name="Clinton targets Valeant">{{cite web | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-clinton-valeant-pharms-idUSMTZSAPEC1SOMIOHM | title=Clinton targets Valeant price hikes in campaign appearance | publisher=Reuters | date=January 28, 2016 | accessdate=July 17, 2016 | author=Beasley, Deena}}</ref>

By October 2015 Valeant had received subpoenas from the [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts|U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts]] and the [[United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York]] in regards to an investigation on Valeant's "drug pricing, distribution and patient assistance program."<ref name="huffingtonpost_15Oct_2015">{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/10/15/valeant-subpoena_n_8301490.html | title=Valeant Pharmaceuticals Subpeonaed In U.S. After Price-Gouging Allegations | publisher=The Huffington Post via The Canadian Press and the Associated Press | date=October 15, 2015 | accessdate=October 15, 2015 | location=New York}}</ref>

===Philidor===
On October 21, 2015, Citron Research, controlled by [[Andrew Left]], a short seller of Valeant shares, claimed that Valeant recorded false sales of products to [[specialty pharmacy]] [[Philidor Rx Services]] and its affiliates. These specialty pharma companies were controlled by Valeant and allegedly resulted in the improper booking of revenue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Valeant-Philador-and-RandO-final-a.pdf|title=Valeant: Could this be the Pharmaceutical Enron?|publisher=}}</ref>

In addition, by controlling the pharmacy services offered by Philidor, Valeant allegedly steered Philidor's customers to expensive drugs sold by Valeant. One alleged practice entailed Valeant employees directly managing Philidor's business operations while posing as Philidor employees and with all written communication under fictitious names.<ref>{{Cite news | title=Valeant and Pharmacy More Intertwined Than Thought | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/valeants-ties-to-pharmacy-scrutinized-1445817449 | newspaper=Wall Street Journal | accessdate=October 10, 2015 | issn=0099-9660 | first=Jonathan D. | last=Rockoff | first2 = Jeanne | last2=Whalen}}{{subscription required}}</ref>

Valeant responded that the allegations by Citron Research were "erroneous."<ref name="CalgaryHerald_2015_10">{{cite web | url=http://www.pressreader.com/canada/calgary-herald/20151022/282273844216418/TextView | title=Valeant stocks plunge, trading halted | work=Calgary Herald | date=October 22, 2015 | accessdate=October 22, 2015 | author=van der Linde, Damon}}</ref>

On October 30, 2015, Valeant said that it would cut ties with Philidor in response to allegations of aggressive billing practices.<ref name="Bloomberg_2015">{{cite web | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-30/valeant-says-it-s-cutting-ties-with-troubled-pharmacy-philidor | title=Valeant Says It's Cutting Ties With Troubled Pharmacy Philidor | publisher=Bloomberg | date=October 30, 2015 | accessdate=October 31, 2015 | author1=Armstrong, Drew | author2=Kitamura, Makiko}}</ref>

[[Walgreens Boots Alliance]] Inc, owner of [[Walgreens]], took over distribution for Valeant.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c754b4d2-a345-11e5-bc70-7ff6d4fd203a.html#axzz44DXnDamt | title=Valeant signs drug deal with Walgreens | publisher=[[Financial Times]] | date=December 15, 2015}}</ref>

===Rigid contact-lens monopoly investigation===
In October 2015, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] began an investigation into Valeant's increasing control of the production of [[rigid gas permeable]] contact lenses. Valeant's acquisition of Bausch & Lomb in 2013, and Paragon Vision Services in 2015, is alleged to have given the company control of over 80% of the production pipeline for hard contact lenses. A series of unilateral price increases beginning in Fall 2015 spurred the FTC's investigation.<ref>{{cite news | last1=Ornstein | first1=Charles | title=Federal Investigators Looking at Valeant’s Contact Lens Dealings | url=https://www.propublica.org/article/federal-investigators-looking-at-valeant-contact-lens-dealings | date=October 27, 2015 | publisher=[[ProPublica]]}}</ref> On November 15, 2016, Valeant agreed to divest itself of Paragon Holdings and Pelican Products to settle charges that its May 2015 acquisition of Paragon reduced competition for the sale of FDA-approved button.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/151-0236-161-0028/valeant-pharmaceuticals-international-inc|title=Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.|date=November 7, 2016|publisher=}}</ref>
