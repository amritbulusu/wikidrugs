'''Delafloxacin''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) (trade name '''Baxdela''') is a [[fluoroquinolone]] [[antibiotic]] used to treat acute bacterial [[skin and skin structure infection]]s, approved by the FDA in June 2017- It was developed and marketed by [[Rib-X Pharmaceuticals|Melinta Therapeutics]] (formerly Rib-X Pharmaceuticals).<ref name=USlabel2017>{{cite web|title=Delafloxacin tablets US label|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/208610s000,208611s000lbl.pdf|publisher=FDA|date=June 2017|accessdate=July 9, 2017}} {{PD-notice}} For label updates, see [https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=overview.process&ApplNo=208610 FDA index page for NDA 208610] for tablets, and see [https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=overview.process&ApplNo=208611 FDA index page for NDA 208611] for injectable form.</ref>

==Medical use==
Delafloxacin is used to treat acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections caused by designated susceptible bacteria.<ref name=USlabel2017/>

Susceptible bacteria are:<ref name=USlabel2017/>
* Gram-positive organisms: ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (including methicillin-resistant [MRSA] and methicillin-susceptible [MSSA] isolates), ''Staphylococcus haemolyticus'', ''Staphylococcus lugdunensis'', ''Streptococcus agalactiae'', ''Streptococcus anginosus'' group, ''Streptococcus pyogenes'', and ''Enterococcus faecalis''
* Gram-negative organisms: ''Escherichia coli'', ''Enterobacter cloacae'', ''Klebsiella pneumoniae'', and ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''.

It has not been tested in pregnant women.<ref name=USlabel2017/>

==Adverse effects==
Like other drugs in the [[fluoroquinolone]] class, delafloxacin contains a [[black box warning]] about the risk of  tendinitis, tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, central nervous system effects, and exacerbation of myasthenia gravis. The label also warns against the risk of [[hypersensitivity reaction]]s and ''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|Clostridium difficile]]''-associated diarrhea.<ref name=USlabel2017/>

Adverse effects occurring in more than 2% of clinical trial subjects included nausea, diarrhea, headache, [[elevated transaminases]], and vomiting.<ref name=USlabel2017/>

==Interactions==
Like other fluoroquinolones, delafloxacin [[chelates]] metals including aluminum, magnesium, sucralfate, iron, zinc, and divalent and trivalent cations like didanosine; using this drugs with antacids, some dietary supplements, or drugs buffered with any of these ions will interfere with available amounds of delafloxacin.<ref name=USlabel2017/>

==Pharmacology==
The half-life varies in around 8 hours at normal doses.  Excretion is 65% through urine, mostly in unmetabolized form, and 28% via feces.  Clearance is reduced in people with severe kidney disease.<ref name=Candel2017>{{cite journal|last1=Candel|first1=FJ|last2=Peñuelas|first2=M|title=Delafloxacin: design, development and potential place in therapy.|journal=Drug design, development and therapy|date=2017|volume=11|pages=881–891|doi=10.2147/DDDT.S106071|pmid=28356714|pmc=5367733}}</ref>

Delafloxacin is more active (lower [[minimum inhibitory concentration|MIC90]]) than other quinolones against [[Gram-positive bacteria]] such as [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA). In contrast to most approved fluoroquinolones, which are [[zwitterion]]ic, delafloxacin has an [[anion]]ic character, which results in a 10-fold increase in delafloxacin accumulation in both bacteria and cells at acidic pH. This property is believed to confer to delafloxacin an advantage for the eradication of ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' in acidic environments, including [[intracellular]] infections.<ref name=Candel2017/>

==Chemistry==
The chemical name is  1-Deoxy-1 (methylamino)-D-glucitol, 1-(6-amino-3,5-difluoropyridin-2-yl)-8-chloro-6-fluoro-7-(3-hydroxyazetidin-1-yl) 4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylate (salt).<ref name=USlabel2017/>

The injectable form of delafloxacin is sold as the [[meglumine]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] of the active ingredient and its [[United States Adopted Name]], delafloxacin meglumine, reflects that; the injection formulation also includes EDTA and sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin.   The tablet is made of delafloxacin, citric acid anhydrous, crospovidone, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, sodium bicarbonate, and sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate.<ref name=USlabel2017/>

==History==
Delafloxacin was known as ABT-492, RX-3341, and WQ-3034 while it was under development.<ref>{{cite web|title=Delafloxacin|url=http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800009417|publisher=AdisInsight|accessdate=10 July 2017|language=en}}</ref>

Delafloxacin was approved by the FDA in June 2017, after it was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam in two trials on 1042 patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Osborne|first1=Randy|title=Melinta’s I.V., oral delafloxacin wins FDA nod in skin infections|url=http://www.bioworld.com/content/melinta%E2%80%99s-iv-oral-delafloxacin-wins-fda-nod-skin-infections-0|work=BioWorld|date=20 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> 

The FDA obligated Melinta to conduct further studies as follows:<ref>{{cite web|title=NDA Approval Letter: NDA 208610 and NDA 208611|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/appletter/2017/208610Orig1s000,208611Orig1s000ltr.pdf|publisher=FDA|date=June 19, 2017}}</ref>
* a 5 year surveillance study to determine if resistance emerges, with the final report due in December 2022
* a study of the IV form in pregnant rats to determine distribution to the reproductive tract, due June 2018, with further studies required if there is significant distribution.
