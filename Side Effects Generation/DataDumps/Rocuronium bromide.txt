'''Rocuronium bromide''' (brand names '''Zemuron''', '''Esmeron''') is an [[aminosteroid]] [[Neuromuscular-blocking drug#Non-depolarizing blocking agents|non-depolarizing]]  [[Neuromuscular-blocking drugs|neuromuscular blocker]] or [[muscle relaxant]] used in modern [[anaesthesia]] to facilitate [[endotracheal intubation]] by providing [[skeletal muscle]] relaxation, most commonly required for [[surgery]] or [[mechanical ventilation]]. It is used for both standard [[Tracheal intubation|endotracheal intubation]] and [[rapid sequence induction]] (RSI), although [[suxamethonium chloride]] is usually selected for RSI given its fast onset of action compared with rocuronium.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tran|first1=DT|last2=Newton|first2=EK|last3=Mount|first3=VA|last4=Lee|first4=JS|last5=Wells|first5=GA|last6=Perry|first6=JJ|title=Rocuronium versus succinylcholine for rapid sequence induction intubation.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=29 October 2015|volume=10|pages=CD002788|pmid=26512948|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002788.pub3}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==

=== Mechanism of action ===
It was designed to be a weaker antagonist at the neuromuscular junction than [[pancuronium]]; hence its monoquaternary structure and its having an [[allyl]] group and a pyrrolidine group attached to the D ring quaternary nitrogen atom. Rocuronium has a rapid onset and intermediate duration of action.<ref name="pmid8652315">{{cite journal |author=Hunter JM |title=Rocuronium: the newest aminosteroid neuromuscular blocking drug |journal=British Journal of Anaesthesia |volume=76 |issue=4 |pages=481–3 |date=April 1996 |pmid=8652315 |doi= 10.1093/bja/76.4.481|url=http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8652315}}</ref> 

There is considered to be a risk of allergic reaction to the drug in some patients (particularly those with [[asthma]]), but a similar incidence of allergic reactions has been observed by using other members of the same drug class (non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs).<ref name="pmid17115010">{{cite journal |vauthors=Burburan SM, Xisto DG, Rocco PR |title=Anaesthetic management in asthma |journal=Minerva Anestesiologica |volume=73 |issue=6 |pages=357–65 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17115010 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

The γ-[[cyclodextrin]] derivative [[sugammadex]] (trade name Bridion) has been recently introduced as a novel agent to reverse the action of rocuronium.<ref name="pmid17312211">{{cite journal |author=Naguib M |title=Sugammadex: another milestone in clinical neuromuscular pharmacology |journal=Anesthesia and Analgesia |volume=104 |issue=3 |pages=575–81 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17312211 |doi=10.1213/01.ane.0000244594.63318.fc |url=http://www.anesthesia-analgesia.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17312211}}</ref> [[Sugammadex]] has been in use since 2009 in many European countries; however, it was turned down for approval twice by the US FDA due to concerns over allergic reactions and bleeding,<ref>{{cite web |last=McKee |first=Selina |title=FDA turns down Merck & Co's sugammadex again |date=September 24, 2013 |work=PharmaTimes |url=http://www.pharmatimes.com/article/13-09-24/FDA_turns_down_Merck_Co_s_sugammadex_again.aspx}}</ref> but finally approved the medication for use during surgical procedures in the United States on December 15, 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm477512.htm|title=Press Announcements - FDA approves Bridion to reverse effects of neuromuscular blocking drugs used during surgery|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-01-07}}</ref> [[Neostigmine]] can also be used as a reversal agent of rocuronium but is not as effective as sugammadex.

==History==
It was introduced in 1994, and is marketed under the trade name of Zemuron in the [[United States]] and Esmeron in most other countries.

== Executions ==

On July 27, 2012, the U.S. state of [[Virginia]] replaced [[pancuronium bromide]], one of the three drugs used in [[execution]] by [[lethal injection]], with rocuronium.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

On 3 October 2016, the U.S. state of [[Ohio]] announced that it would resume executions on January 12, 2017, using a combination of [[midazolam]], rocuronium bromide, and [[potassium chloride]]. Prior to this, the last execution in Ohio was in January 2014.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-37545854|title=Ohio to resume executions using a three-drug combination in January|date=2016-10-03|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-07}}</ref>

On August 24, 2017, the U.S. state of [[Florida]] executed Mark James Asay using a combination of [[etomidate]], rocuronium bromide, and [[potassium acetate]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/florida/fl-reg-florida-execution-asay-20170824-story.html|title=Florida executes convicted killer Mark Asay using new drug|author=Jason Dearon|publisher=Sun Sentinel}}</ref>
