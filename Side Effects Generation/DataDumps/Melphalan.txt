'''Melphalan''' (trade name '''Alkeran''', in former [[USSR]] also known as '''Sarcolysin''') is a [[chemotherapy]] [[medication|drug]] belonging to the class of [[nitrogen mustard]] [[alkylating antineoplastic agent|alkylating agents]].

An alkylating agent adds an alkyl group (C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+1</sub>) to DNA. It attaches the alkyl group to the [[guanine]] base of DNA, at the number 7 nitrogen atom of the imidazole ring.

Otherwise known as <small>L</small>-phenylalanine mustard, or <small>L</small>-PAM, melphalan is a [[phenylalanine]] derivative of [[mechlorethamine]].

== Mechanism of action ==
Melphalan chemically alters through [[alkylation]] of the [[DNA]] nucleotide [[guanine]], and causes linkages between strands of DNA. This chemical alteration inhibits [[DNA synthesis]] and [[RNA synthesis]], functions necessary for cells to survive. These changes cause [[cytotoxicity]] in both dividing and non-dividing tumor cells.<ref>{{cite web|title=Melphalan|url=http://www.cancer.gov/drugdictionary?cdrid=42973|publisher=National Cancer Institute|accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref>

== Uses ==
It is used to treat [[multiple myeloma]],<ref name="pmid17920916">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Facon T, Mary JY, Hulin C, etal |title=Melphalan and prednisone plus thalidomide versus melphalan and prednisone alone or reduced-intensity autologous stem cell transplantation in elderly patients with multiple myeloma (IFM 99-06): a randomised trial |journal=Lancet |volume=370 |issue=9594 |pages=1209–18 |date=October 2007 |pmid=17920916 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61537-2 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(07)61537-2}}</ref> [[ovarian cancer]], [[AL amyloidosis]], and occasionally [[malignant melanoma]].

The agent was first investigated as a possible drug for use in [[melanoma]],  it was not found to be effective.

On March 15, 2016 it was approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] under the trade name '''Evomela''' for:
* use as a high-dose [[Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation#Conditioning_regimens|conditioning]] treatment prior to [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|hematopoietic progenitor (stem) cell transplantation]] in [[multiple myeloma]] (MM) patients
* the palliative treatment of MM patients for whom oral therapy is not appropriate<ref>{{cite web|title=Evomela (melphalan) for Injection, for Intravenous Use. Full Prescribing Information|url=http://evomela.com|publisher=Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Irvine, CA 92618|accessdate=17 March 2016}}</ref>

Melphalan is currently being used to treat ocular [[retinoblastoma]], a pediatric solid tumor.  This is accomplished via transarterial catheter based slow pulsed infusion into the ophthalmic artery.<ref name="pmid21320950">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Gobin YP, Dunkel IJ, Marr BP, etal |title= Intra-arterial chemotherapy for the management of retinoblastoma: four-year experience|journal=Arch Ophthalmol|volume=129|issue=6|pages=732–7 |date=Jun 2011 |pmid=21320950 |doi=10.1001/archophthalmol.2011.5| url=http://archopht.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=427366}}</ref>

== Administration ==
Oral or intravenous; dosing varies by purpose and route of administration as well as patient weight.

== Side effects ==
Common side effects include:
* [[Nausea]] and vomiting, and oral ulceration.
* [[Bone marrow]] suppression, including
** [[Leukopenia|Decreased white blood cell count]] causing increased risk of [[infection]]
** [[Thrombocytopenia|Decreased platelet count]] causing increased risk of bleeding

Less common side effects include:
* Severe [[allergic reaction]]s
* [[Pulmonary fibrosis]] (scarring of lung tissue) including fatal outcomes (usually only with prolonged use)
* [[Alopecia|Hair loss]]
* [[Interstitial pneumonitis]]
* [[Rash]]
* [[Pruritus|Itching]]
* Irreversible bone marrow failure due to melphalan not being withdrawn early enough
* [[Cardiac arrest]]

== Synthesis ==
Another [[amino acid]]-like drug is the [[antineoplastic]] agent melphalan. [[Tumor cells]] spend less time in resting phases than normal cells so at any given time, they are more likely to be metabolically active than most normal host cells. The rationale behind incorporating an alkylating function in a molecule resembling a primary cellular metabolite was to get a greater safety margin by fooling tumor cells into taking up the toxin preferentially.

''p''-Nitrophenyl-[[alanine]] ('''1''') was converted to its [[phthalimide]] by heating with [[phthalic anhydride]], and this was converted to its ethyl [[ester]] ('''2'''). Catalytic hydrogenation produced the corresponding aniline. Heating in acid with [[oxirane]], followed by treatment with [[phosphorus oxychloride]] provided the bischloride, and removal of the protecting groups by heating in hydrochloric acid gave melphalan ('''3''').
