Fosazepam has similar effects on sleep as other benzodiazepines. In a clinical trial it was reported that fosazepam to lead to increased sleep duration with less broken sleep but sleep quality was worsened with suppressed deep sleep and increased light sleep. Adverse effects included feelings of impaired morning vitality and upon discontinuing the drug [[benzodiazepine withdrawal]] symptoms of [[anxiety]], impaired concentration and impaired morning vitality were experienced.<ref name="Allen-1976"/> Another clinical trial also found worsening of sleep while on benzodiazepines as well as during withdrawal with suppression of deep sleep stages including [[REM sleep]], with increased light sleep upon [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]].<ref name="Risberg-1977"/> The main metabolites of fosazepam are 3-hydroxyfosazepam and the [[active metabolite]] [[desmethyldiazepam]] which has a very long [[elimination half-life]] of about 3 days.<ref name="Allen-1976"/> [[Drug tolerance|Tolerance]] to the [[hypnotic]] effects of fosazepam starts to develop after about 7 days of use.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Viukari | first1 = M. | last2 = Linnoila | first2 = M. | last3 = Aalto | first3 = U. | title = Efficacy and side effects of flurazepam, fosazepam, and nitrazepam as sleeping aids in psychogeriatric patients | journal = Acta Psychiatr Scand | volume = 57 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–35 |date=Jan 1978 | pmid = 24980 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1978.tb06871.x }}</ref> Due to the very long elimination half-life of the active metabolite of fosazepam it is not recommended for use as a hypnotic.<ref name="Breimer-1980">{{Cite journal | last1 = Breimer | first1 = DD. | last2 = Jochemsen | first2 = R. | last3 = von Albert | first3 = HH. | title = Pharmacokinetics of benzodiazepines.

Fosazepam is of relatively low potency compared to other benzodiazepine derivatives, with a 100&nbsp;mg dose of fosazepam equivalent to 10&nbsp;mg of [[nitrazepam]].<ref name="Risberg-1977">{{Cite journal | last1 = Risberg | first1 = AM. | last2 = Henricsson | first2 = S. | last3 = Ingvar | first3 = DH. | title = Evaluation of the effect of fosazepam (a new benzodiazepine), nitrazepam and placebo on sleep patterns in normal subjects | journal = Eur J Clin Pharmacol | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 105–9 |date=Oct 1977 | pmid = 200435 | doi = 10.1007/BF00645130 }}</ref> 60&nbsp;mg of fosazepam has also been estimated to be equivalent to about 5–10&nbsp;mg of diazepam.<ref name="Clarke-1975"/> Fosazepam has similar effects to nitrazepam, but with a shorter duration of action and less tendency to cause over sedation, motor-impairment, amnesia, rebound insomnia, and morning grogginess.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Viukari | first1 = M | last2 = Linnoila | first2 = M | last3 = Aalto | first3 = U | date = Jan 1978 | title = Efficacy and side effects of flurazepam, fosazepam, and nitrazepam as sleeping aids in psychogeriatric patients | url = | journal = [[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]] | volume = 57 | issue = 1| pages = 27–35 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.1978.tb06871.x | pmid=24980}}</ref>
