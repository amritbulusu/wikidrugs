== Medical uses ==
===Anxiety===
Lorazepam has anxiety-reducing effects and its best-known indication is the short-term management of severe anxiety. In the US, the FDA advises against use of benzodiazepines such as lorazepam for longer than four weeks.<ref name=Altrx2007 /><ref>{{ cite news | author = Rabin RC | title = Disparities: Study Finds Risk in Off-Label Prescribing | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/25/health/research/25disp.html | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | page = D6 | date = 2009-08-25 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170219121327/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/25/health/research/25disp.html | archivedate = 2017-02-19 | df =  }}</ref> It is fast acting, and useful in treating fast onset panic anxiety.<ref name="pmid6144459">{{Cite journal | author = Lader M | title = Short-term versus long-term benzodiazepine therapy | journal = Current Medical Research and Opinion | year = 1984 | volume = 8 | issue = Suppl 4 | pages = 120–126 | pmid = 6144459 | doi=10.1185/03007998409109550}}</ref>

Lorazepam can effectively reduce agitation and induce sleep, and the duration of  effects from a single dose makes it an appropriate choice for the short-term treatment of [[insomnia]], especially in the presence of severe anxiety or night terrors. It has a fairly short duration of action.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Aschenbrenner |first1=Diane S. |author2=Samantha J.

Withdrawal symptoms, including [[rebound insomnia]] and [[rebound anxiety]], may occur after seven days' use of lorazepam.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Scharf MB, Kales A, Bixler EO, Jacoby JA, Schweitzer PK | title = Lorazepam-efficacy, side effects, and rebound phenomena | journal = Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics | year = 1982 | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 175–179 | doi = 10.1038/clpt.1982.27 | pmid = 6120058 }}</ref>

Lorazepam's [[anticonvulsant]] properties and [[pharmacokinetic profile]], make intravenous use reliable for terminating [[status epilepticus|acute seizures]], but induces prolonged sedation. Oral benzodiazepines, including lorazepam are occasionally used as long-term [[prophylactic]] treatment of resistant [[absence seizure]]s; because of gradual [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]] to their anti-seizure effects, benzodiazepines such as lorazepam are not considered first-line therapies.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Isojärvi JI, Tokola RA | title = Benzodiazepines in the treatment of epilepsy in people with intellectual disability | journal = Journal of Intellectual Disability Research | year = 1998 | volume = 42 | issue = 1 | pages = 80–92 | pmid = 10030438 }}</ref>

Lorazepam's anticonvulsant and CNS depressant properties are useful for the treatment and prevention of [[alcohol withdrawal syndrome]]. In this setting, impaired liver function is not a hazard with lorazepam, since lorazepam does not require oxidation, hepatic or otherwise, for its metabolism.<ref name="pmid8700792" /><ref name="Bråthen-2005">{{Cite journal|vauthors=Bråthen G, Ben-Menachem E, Brodtkorb E, Galvin R, Garcia-Monco JC, Halasz P, Hillbom M, Leone MA, Young AB | title = EFNS guideline on the diagnosis and management of alcohol-related seizures: report of an EFNS task force | journal = European Journal of Neurology | year = 2005 | volume = 12 | issue = 8 | pages = 575–581 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-1331.2005.01247.x | pmid = 16053464 }}</ref>

===Sedation===
Lorazepam is sometimes used for individuals receiving [[mechanical ventilation]]. However, in critically ill people, [[propofol]] has been found to be superior to lorazepam both in effectiveness and overall cost; as a result, the use of propofol for this indication is now encouraged, whereas the use of lorazepam is discouraged.<ref name="Cox-2008">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Cox CE, Reed SD, Govert JA, Rodgers JE, Campbell-Bright S, Kress JP, Carson SS | title = An Economic Evaluation of Propofol and Lorazepam for Critically Ill Patients Undergoing Mechanical Ventilation | journal = Critical Care Medicine | year = 2008 | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 706–714 | doi = 10.1097/CCM.0B013E3181544248 | pmc = 2763279 | pmid = 18176312 }}</ref>

It is given before a general anesthetic to reduce the amount of anesthetic required, or before unpleasant awake procedures, such as in dentistry or endoscopies, to reduce anxiety, to increase compliance, and to induce amnesia for the procedure.

== Adverse effects ==
Many beneficial effects of lorazepam (e.g., sedative, muscle relaxant, anti-anxiety, and amnesic effects) may become adverse effects when unwanted.<ref name="Hindmarch" /> Adverse effects can include sedation and [[hypotension|low blood pressure]]; the effects of lorazepam are increased in combination with other [[CNS depressant]] drugs.<ref name="Walker-2005" /><ref name="Battaglia-2005" /> Other adverse effects include confusion, [[ataxia]], inhibiting the formation of new memories, and hangover effects. With [[Effects of long-term benzodiazepine use|long-term benzodiazepine use]] it is unclear whether cognitive impairments fully return to normal after stopping lorazepam use; cognitive deficits persist for at least six months after withdrawal, but longer than six months may be required for recovery of cognitive function. Lorazepam appears to have more profound adverse effects on memory than other benzodiazepines; it impairs both [[explicit memory|explicit]] and [[implicit memory]].<ref name="Bishop, Curran 1998">{{cite journal|last=Bishop|first=KI|author2=Curran, HV |title=An investigation of the effects of benzodiazepine receptor ligands and of scopolamine on conceptual priming|journal=Psychopharmacology|date=December 1998|volume=140|issue=3|pages=345–53|pmid=9877014|doi=10.1007/s002130050775}}</ref><ref name="Bishop, Curran 1995">{{cite journal|last=Bishop|first=KI|author2=Curran, HV |title=Psychopharmacological analysis of implicit and explicit memory: a study with lorazepam and the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil.|journal=Psychopharmacology|date=September 1995|volume=121|issue=2|pages=267–78|pmid=8545533|doi=10.1007/bf02245638}}</ref>  In the elderly, falls may occur as a result of benzodiazepines. Adverse effects are more common in the elderly, and they appear at lower doses than in younger patients. Benzodiazepines can cause or worsen [[Major depression|depression]]. [[Paradoxical effects]] can also occur, such as worsening of seizures, or paradoxical excitement; paradoxical excitement is more likely to occur in the elderly, children, those with a history of alcohol abuse, and in people with a history of aggression or anger problems.<ref name="Riss-2008" /> Lorazepam's effects are dose-dependent, meaning the higher the dose, the stronger the effects (and side effects) will be. Using the smallest dose needed to achieve desired effects lessens the risk of adverse effects.

Sedation is the side effect people taking lorazepam most frequently report. In a group of around 3,500 patients treated for anxiety, the most common side effects complained of from lorazepam were sedation (15.9%), dizziness (6.9%), weakness (4.2%), and unsteadiness (3.4%).

=== Contraindications ===
{{refimprove|section|date=June 2017}}
Lorazepam should be avoided in people with:
* [[Allergy]] or [[hypersensitivity]] – Past hypersensitivity or allergy to lorazepam, to any benzodiazepine, or to any of the ingredients in lorazepam tablets or injections
* [[Respiratory failure|Severe respiratory failure]] – Benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, may depress central nervous system respiratory drive and are contraindicated in severe respiratory failure. An example would be the inappropriate use to relieve anxiety associated with [[status asthmaticus|acute severe asthma]]. The anxiolytic effects may also be detrimental to a patient's willingness and ability to fight for breath. However, if [[mechanical ventilation]] becomes necessary, lorazepam may be used to facilitate deep sedation.
* [[Substance intoxication|Acute intoxication]] – Lorazepam may interact synergistically with the effects of alcohol, narcotics, or other psychoactive substances. It should, therefore, not be administered to a drunk or intoxicated person.
* [[Ataxia]] – This is a neurological clinical sign, consisting of unsteady and clumsy motion of the limbs and torso, due to failure of gross muscle movement coordination, most evident on standing and walking. It is the classic way in which acute alcohol intoxication may affect a person. Benzodiazepines should not be administered to already-ataxic patients.
* [[Glaucoma|Acute narrow-angle glaucoma]] – Lorazepam has pupil-dilating effects, which may further interfere with the drainage of [[aqueous humor]] from the anterior chamber of the eye, thus worsening narrow-angle [[glaucoma]].
* [[Sleep apnea]] – Sleep apnea may be worsened by lorazepam's central nervous system depressant effects. It may further reduce the patient's ability to protect his or her airway during sleep.{{fact|date=June 2017}}
* [[Myasthenia gravis]] – This condition is characterized by muscle weakness, so a muscle relaxant such as lorazepam may exacerbate symptoms.
* [[Pregnancy]] and [[breast feeding]] – Lorazepam belongs to the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) pregnancy category D, which means it is likely to cause harm to the developing baby, if taken during the first trimester of pregnancy. Evidence is inconclusive whether lorazepam, if taken early in pregnancy, results in reduced intelligence, neurodevelopmental problems, physical malformations in cardiac or facial structure, or other malformations in some newborns. Lorazepam given to pregnant women antenatally may cause [[hypotonia|floppy infant syndrome]]<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Kanto JH | title = Use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy, labour and lactation, with particular reference to pharmacokinetic considerations | journal = Drugs | year = 1982 | volume = 23 | issue = 5 | pages = 354–380 | pmid = 6124415 | doi = 10.2165/00003495-198223050-00002 }}</ref> in the neonate, or respiratory depression necessitating ventilation. Regular lorazepam use during late pregnancy (the [[third trimester]]), carries a definite risk of [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]] in the neonate. Neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal may include [[hypotonia]], reluctance to suck, [[apneic]] spells, [[cyanosis]], and impaired [[metabolic]] responses to cold stress. Symptoms of floppy infant syndrome and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome have been reported to persist from hours to months after birth.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = McElhatton PR | title = The effects of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy and lactation | journal = Reproductive Toxicology | year = 1994 | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = 461–475 | pmid = 7881198 | doi = 10.1016/0890-6238(94)90029-9 }}</ref> Lorazepam may also inhibit fetal liver bilirubin glucuronidation, leading to neonatal jaundice. Lorazepam is present in breast milk, so caution must be exercised about breast feeding.

=== Specific groups ===
* Children and the elderly – The safety and effectiveness of lorazepam is not well determined in children under 18 years of age, but it is used to treat acute seizures. Dose requirements have to be individualized, especially in the elderly and debilitated patients in whom the risk of oversedation is greater. Long-term therapy may lead to cognitive deficits, especially in the elderly, which may only be partially reversible. The elderly metabolise benzodiazepines more slowly than younger people and are more sensitive to the adverse effects of benzodiazepines compared to younger individuals even at similar plasma levels. Additionally, the elderly tend to take more drugs which may interact or enhance the effects of benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, have been found to increase the risk of falls and fractures in the elderly. As a result, dosage recommendations for the elderly are about half of those used in younger individuals and used for no longer than two weeks.<ref name="Riss-2008" /><ref name="Authier-2009">{{Cite journal|vauthors=Authier N, Balayssac D, Sautereau M, Zangarelli A, Courty P, Somogyi AA, Vennat B, Llorca PM, Eschalier A | title = Benzodiazepine dependence: focus on withdrawal syndrome | journal = Annales Pharmaceutiques Françaises | year = 2009 | volume = 67 | issue = 6 | pages = 408–413 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharma.2009.07.001 | pmid = 19900604 }}</ref> Lorazepam may also be slower to clear in the elderly, leading potentially to accumulation and enhanced effects.<ref name="Butler-2008">{{ Cite journal |vauthors=Butler JM, Begg EJ | title = Free drug metabolic clearance in elderly people | journal = Clinical Pharmacokinetics | year = 2008 | volume = 47 | issue = 5 | pages = 297–321 | doi = 10.2165/00003088-200847050-00002 | pmid = 18399712 }}</ref> Lorazepam, similar to other benzodiazepines and [[nonbenzodiazepines]], causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning.

* [[Liver failure|Liver]] or [[kidney failure]] – Lorazepam may be safer than most benzodiazepines in patients with [[liver failure|impaired liver function]]. Like [[oxazepam]], it does not require hepatic oxidation, but only hepatic glucuronidation into lorazepam-glucuronide. Therefore, impaired liver function is unlikely to result in lorazepam accumulation to an extent causing adverse reactions.<ref name="pmid8700792">{{Cite journal | author = Peppers MP | title = Benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal in the elderly and in patients with liver disease | journal = Pharmacotherapy | year = 1996 | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–57 | pmid = 8700792 | doi=10.1002/j.1875-9114.1996.tb02915.x}}</ref> Similarly [[renal]] disease has minimal effects on lorazepam levels.<ref name="Olkkola-2008" />
* Surgical premedication – [[Informed consent]] given only after receiving lorazepam [[premedication]] could have its validity challenged later. Staff must use [[Chaperone (clinical)|chaperones]] to guard against allegations of abuse during treatment. Such allegations may arise because of incomplete amnesia, disinhibition, and impaired ability to process cues. Because of its relative long duration of residual effects ([[sedation]], [[ataxia]], [[hypotension]], and [[anterograde amnesia|amnesia]]), lorazepam premedication is best suited for hospital inpatient use. Patients should not be discharged from the hospital within 24 hours of receiving lorazepam premedication, unless accompanied by a caregiver. They should also not drive, operate machinery, or use alcohol within this period.
* [[Drug abuse|Drug and alcohol dependence]] – The risk of abuse of lorazepam is increased in dependent patients.<ref name="Authier-2009" />
* [[Comorbid]] [[psychiatric disorders]] also increase the risk of dependence and paradoxical adverse effects.<ref name="Authier-2009" />

=== Tolerance and dependence ===
Dependence typified by a withdrawal syndrome occurs in about one-third of individuals who are treated for longer than four weeks with a benzodiazepine. Higher doses and longer periods of use increase the risk of developing a [[benzodiazepine dependence]]. Potent benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, [[alprazolam]], and [[triazolam]], have the highest risk of causing a dependence.<ref name="Riss-2008" /> Tolerance to benzodiazepine effects develops with regular use. This is desirable with amnesic and sedative effects, but undesirable with anxiolytic, hypnotic, and anticonvulsant effects. Patients at first experience drastic relief from anxiety and sleeplessness, but symptoms gradually return, relatively soon in the case of insomnia, but more slowly in the case of anxiety symptoms. After four to six months of regular benzodiazepine use, evidence of continued efficacy declines.

If regular treatment is continued for longer than four to six months, dose increases may be necessary to maintain effects, but treatment-resistant symptoms may in fact be [[Benzodiazepine withdrawal#Withdrawal symptoms|benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms]].<ref name="pmid10779253">{{Cite journal | vauthors = Longo LP, Johnson B | title = Addiction: Part I.

Increasing the dose may overcome tolerance, but tolerance may then develop to the higher dose and adverse effects may persist and worsen. The mechanism of tolerance to benzodiazepines is complex and involves [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor]] downregulation, alterations to subunit configuration of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, [[Uncoupling (neuropsychopharmacology)|uncoupling]] and [[internalisation]] of the benzodiazepine binding site from the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor complex as well as changes in [[gene expression]].<ref name="Riss-2008" />

The likelihood of dependence is relatively high with lorazepam compared to other benzodiazepines. Lorazepam's relatively short serum half-life, its confinement mainly to the vascular space, and its inactive metabolite, can result in interdose withdrawal phenomena and next-dose cravings, that may reinforce psychological dependence. Because of its high potency, the smallest lorazepam tablet strength of 0.5&nbsp;mg is also a significant dose reduction (in the UK, the smallest tablet strength is 1.0&nbsp;mg, which further accentuates this difficulty). To minimise the risk of physical/psychological dependence, lorazepam is best used only short-term, at the smallest effective dose. If any benzodiazepine has been used long-term, the recommendation is a gradual dose taper over a period of weeks, months or longer, according to dose and duration of use, degree of dependence and the individual.

Coming off long-term lorazepam use may be more realistically achieved by a gradual switch to an equivalent dose of [[diazepam]] and a period of stabilization on this, and only then initiating dose reductions. The advantage of switching to diazepam is that dose reductions are felt less acutely, because of the longer half-lives (20–200 hours) of diazepam and its active metabolites.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.benzo.org.uk/ashvtaper.htm | title = Reasons for a diazepam (Valium) taper | author = Ashton HC |date=April 2001 | accessdate = 2007-06-01 | publisher = benzo.org.uk }}</ref>

=== Withdrawal ===
On abrupt or overly rapid discontinuation of lorazepam, anxiety and signs of physical withdrawal have been observed, similar to those seen on withdrawal from alcohol and barbiturates. Lorazepam, as with other [[benzodiazepine]] drugs, can cause [[physical dependence]], [[Substance use disorder|addiction]], and [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]]. The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can, however, occur from standard dosages and also after short-term use. Benzodiazepine treatment should be discontinued as soon as possible via a slow and gradual dose reduction regimen.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=MacKinnon GL, Parker WA | title = Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome: a literature review and evaluation | journal = The American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse | year = 1982 | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–33 | pmid = 6133446 | doi = 10.3109/00952998209002608 }}</ref> [[Rebound effects]] often resemble the condition being treated, but typically at a more intense level and may be difficult to diagnose. Withdrawal symptoms can range from mild anxiety and insomnia to more severe symptoms such as [[seizures]] and [[psychosis]]. The risk and severity of withdrawal is increased with long-term use, use of high doses, abrupt or over-rapid reduction, among other factors. Short-acting benzodiazepines such as lorazepam are more likely to cause a more severe withdrawal syndrome compared to longer-acting benzodiazepines.<ref name="Riss-2008" />

Withdrawal symptoms can occur after taking therapeutic doses of Ativan for as little as one week. Withdrawal symptoms include headaches, anxiety, tension, depression, insomnia, restlessness, confusion, irritability, sweating, [[dysphoria]], dizziness, [[derealization]], depersonalization, numbness/tingling of extremities, hypersensitivity to light, sound, and smell, perceptual distortions, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, appetite loss, hallucinations, delirium, seizures, tremor, stomach cramps, [[myalgia]], agitation, palpitations, [[tachycardia]], panic attacks, short-term memory loss, and hyperthermia. It takes about 18–36 hours for the benzodiazepine to be removed from the body.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/safety/2007/Apr_PI/Ativan_PI.pdf | format = PDF | title = Ativan Labeling Revision | date = April 2007 | accessdate = 2007-10-03 | publisher = FDA | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080307080808/http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/safety/2007/Apr_PI/Ativan_PI.pdf | archivedate = 2008-03-07 | df =  }}</ref> The ease of addiction to lorazepam, (Ativan brand was particularly cited), and its withdrawal were brought to the attention of the British public during the early 1980s in Esther Rantzen's BBC TV series ''[[That's Life!]]'', in a feature on the drug over a number of episodes.

=== Interactions ===
Lorazepam is not usually fatal in overdose, but may cause fatal respiratory depression if taken in overdose with alcohol. The combination also causes synergistic enhancement of the [[disinhibition|disinhibitory]] and [[anterograde amnesia|amnesic]] effects of both drugs, with potentially embarrassing or criminal consequences.

=== Overdose ===
{{See also|Benzodiazepine overdose}}
In cases of a suspected lorazepam overdose, it is important to establish whether the patient is a regular user of lorazepam or other benzodiazepines, since regular use causes tolerance to develop. Also, one must ascertain whether other substances were also ingested.

Signs of overdose range through mental confusion, [[dysarthria]], [[paradoxical reaction]]s, [[drowsiness]], [[hypotonia]], [[ataxia]], [[hypotension]], [[Hypnosis|hypnotic state]], [[coma]], cardiovascular depression, [[respiratory depression]], and [[death]].

Early management of alert patients includes [[emetics]], [[gastric lavage]], and [[activated charcoal]]. Otherwise, management is by observation, including of vital signs, support and, only if necessary, considering the hazards of doing so, giving [[intravenous]] [[flumazenil]].

Patients are ideally nursed in a kind, nonfrustrating environment, since, when given or taken in high doses, benzodiazepines are more likely to cause paradoxical reactions. If shown sympathy, even quite crudely feigned, patients may respond solicitously, but they may respond with disproportionate aggression to frustrating cues.<ref>{{ cite book | publisher = Council of Europe, Pompidou Group | location = Strassbourg | year = 2002 | title = Contribution to the sensible use of benzodiazepines | isbn = 978-92-871-4751-6 }}</ref> Opportunistic [[counseling]] has limited value here, as the patient is unlikely to recall this later, owing to drug-induced anterograde amnesia.

=== Detection in body fluids ===
Lorazepam may be quantitated in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients, provide evidence in an impaired driving arrest or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma concentrations are usually in a range of 10-300&nbsp;μg/l in persons either receiving the drug therapeutically or in those arrested for impaired driving. Approximately 300-1000&nbsp;μg/l is found in victims of acute overdosage.<ref>{{ cite book | author =Baselt R | title = Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man | edition = 8th | publisher = Biomedical Publications | location = Foster City, CA | year = 2008 | pages = 860–862 }}</ref>

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Lorazepam is highly protein bound and is extensively metabolised into pharmacologically inactive metabolites.<ref name="Riss-2008" /> Due to its poor lipid solubility, lorazepam is absorbed relatively slowly by mouth and is unsuitable for rectal administration. However, its poor lipid solubility and high degree of protein binding (85-90%<ref name="Lorzem" />) mean its volume of distribution is mainly the [[Circulatory system|vascular]] compartment, causing relatively prolonged peak effects. This contrasts with the highly lipid-soluble [[diazepam]], which, although rapidly absorbed orally or rectally, soon redistributes from the serum to other parts of the body, in particular body fat. This explains why one lorazepam dose, despite its shorter serum half-life, has more prolonged peak effects than an equivalent diazepam dose.<ref name="pmid3234245">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Funderburk FR, Griffiths RR, McLeod DR, Bigelow GE, Mackenzie A, Liebson IA, Nemeth-Coslett R | title = Relative abuse liability of lorazepam and diazepam: an evaluation in 'recreational' drug users | journal = Drug and Alcohol Dependence | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 215–222 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3234245| doi = 10.1016/0376-8716(88)90021-X }}</ref> Lorazepam is rapidly conjugated at its 3-hydroxy group into lorazepam glucuronide which is then excreted in the urine. Lorazepam glucuronide has no demonstrable CNS activity in animals. The plasma levels of lorazepam are proportional to the dose given. There is no evidence of accumulation of lorazepam on administration up to six months. On regular administration, diazepam will accumulate, since it has a longer half-life and active metabolites, these metabolites also have long half-lives.

'''Clinical example:''' Diazepam has long been a drug of choice for [[status epilepticus]]; its high lipid solubility means it gets absorbed with equal speed whether given orally, or rectally (nonintravenous routes are convenient in outside hospital settings), but diazepam's high lipid solubility also means it does not remain in the vascular space, but soon redistributes into other body tissues. So, it may be necessary to repeat diazepam doses to maintain peak anticonvulsant effects, resulting in excess body accumulation. Lorazepam is a different case; its low lipid solubility makes it relatively slowly absorbed by any route other than intravenously, but once injected, it will not get significantly redistributed beyond the vascular space. Therefore, lorazepam's anticonvulsant effects are more durable, thus reducing the need for repeated doses. If a patient is known to usually stop convulsing after only one or two diazepam doses, it may be preferable because sedative after effects will be less than if a single dose of lorazepam is given (diazepam anticonvulsant/sedative effects wear off after 15–30 minutes, but lorazepam effects last 12–24 hours).<ref name="pmid11898891">{{Cite journal | author = Lackner TE | title = Strategies for optimizing antiepileptic drug therapy in elderly people | journal = Pharmacotherapy | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 329–364 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11898891 | doi = 10.1592/phco.22.5.329.33192 | url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/430209_3 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20031015072253/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/430209_3 | archivedate = 2003-10-15 | df =  }}</ref> The prolonged sedation from lorazepam may, however, be an acceptable trade-off for its reliable duration of effects, particularly if the patient needs to be transferred to another facility.

They, however, do not on their own enhance the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, but require the [[neurotransmitter]] GABA to be present.

The magnitude and duration of lorazepam effects are dose-related, meaning larger doses have stronger and longer-lasting effects, because the brain has spare benzodiazepine drug receptor capacity, with single, clinical doses leading only to an occupancy of some 3% of the available receptors.<ref name="pmid8395663">{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Sybirska E, Seibyl JP, Bremner JD, etal | title = <nowiki>[</nowiki><sup>123</sup>I<nowiki>]</nowiki>Iomazenil SPECT imaging demonstrates significant benzodiazepine receptor reserve in human and nonhuman primate brain | journal = Neuropharmacology | year = 1993 | volume = 32 | issue = 7 | pages = 671–680 | pmid = 8395663 | doi = 10.1016/0028-3908(93)90080-M }}</ref>

The anticonvulsant properties of lorazepam and other benzodiazepines may be, in part or entirely, due to binding to voltage-dependent [[sodium channels]] rather than benzodiazepine receptors.

== Physical properties and formulations ==
[[File:Ativan05mg.jpg|thumb|0.5 mg tablets of the Ativan brand of lorazepam.]]
Pure lorazepam is an almost white powder that is nearly insoluble in water and oil. In medicinal form, it is mainly available as tablets and a solution for injection, but, in some locations, it is also available as a skin patch, an oral solution, and a [[sublingual]] tablet.

Lorazepam tablets and syrups are administered by mouth only. Lorazepam tablets of the Ativan brand also contain [[lactose]], [[cellulose|microcrystalline cellulose]], [[polacrilin]], [[magnesium stearate]], and coloring agents ([[indigo carmine]] in blue tablets and [[tartrazine]] in yellow tablets). Lorazepam for injection formulated with [[polyethylene glycol]] 400 in [[propylene glycol]] with 2.0% [[benzyl alcohol]] as preservative.

Lorazepam injectable solution is administered either by deep [[intramuscular injection]] or by [[intravenous therapy|intravenous]] injection. The injectable solution comes in 1&nbsp;ml [[ampoule]]s containing 2 or 4&nbsp;mg of lorazepam. The solvents used are [[polyethylene glycol]] 400 and [[propylene glycol]].
