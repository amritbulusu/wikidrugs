'''Racetams''' are a class of [[psychoactive drug|drugs]] that share a [[2-pyrrolidone|pyrrolidone]] nucleus.<ref>{{Cite journal

}}</ref> Some, such as [[piracetam]], are considered [[nootropic]]s.<!--Note: Some racetams such as levetiracetam are anti-nootropic, if anything.--> Some such as [[oxiracetam]] and [[phenylpiracetam]] are also [[stimulant]]s. Others such as [[levetiracetam]] and [[seletracetam]] are [[anticonvulsant]]s.

==Mechanism==
There is no universally accepted mechanism of action for racetams. Racetams generally show negligible affinity for common central nervous system receptors, but modulation of central [[neurotransmitter]]s, including [[acetylcholine]] and [[glutamate]], has been reported. Although [[aniracetam]] and [[nebracetam]] show affinity for [[muscarinic]] receptors, only [[nefiracetam]] demonstrates nanomolar interactions. Modification of membrane-located mechanisms of central signal transduction is another hypothesis.<ref>{{Cite journal

Like some [[ampakine]]s, some racetams such as piracetam and aniracetam are positive [[allosteric modulator]]s of the [[AMPA receptor]].<ref>{{Cite journal

Racetams are understood to work by activating [[glutamate receptor]]s that are colocalized with [[cholinergic receptor]]s, thus increasing the frequency of activation of the latter.<ref>{{Cite journal

===Cofactors===
In studies with aged rats, marked improvement has been observed in cognitive tasks in experimental groups given piracetam. Performance was further increased with piracetam combined with [[choline]]s. Evidence in studies with rats has indicated that the potency of piracetam is increased when administered with [[choline]].<ref>{{Cite journal
