'''Meclofenamic acid''' ('''meclofenamate sodium''', brand '''Meclomen''') is a drug used for joint, muscular pain, arthritis and [[dysmenorrhea]].<ref>http://www.medicinenet.com/meclofenamate/article.htm</ref>
It is a member of the [[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug#Anthranilic acid derivatives (Fenamates)|anthranilic acid derivatives]] (or fenamate) class of [[NSAID]] drugs and was approved by the FDA in 1980.<ref>FDA [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.Set_Current_Drug&ApplNo=018006&DrugName=MECLOMEN&ActiveIngred=MECLOFENAMATE%20SODIUM&SponsorApplicant=PARKE%20DAVIS&ProductMktStatus=3&goto=Search.DrugDetails Meclomen page at FDA] Page accessed July 3, 2015</ref> Like other members of the class, it is a [[COX]] inhibitor and prevents formation of [[prostaglandins]].<ref name=LiverTox>NIH LiverTox Database [http://livertox.nih.gov/MefenamicAcid.htm Mefenamic Acid] Last updated June 23, 2015. Page accessed July 3, 2015</ref>

Scientists led by Claude Winder from [[Parke-Davis]] invented meclofenamate sodium in 1964, along with fellow members of the class,  [[mefenamic acid]] in 1961 and [[flufenamic acid]] in 1963.<ref>Whitehouse M.

It is not widely used in humans as it has a high rate (30-60%) rate of gastrointestinal side effects.<ref>Jeffrey K. Aronson. Meyler's Side Effects of Analgesics and Anti-inflammatory Drugs. Elsevier, 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-08-093294-1}}</ref>{{rp|310}} As of 2015 the cost for a typical course of medication in the United States is 50 to 100 USD.<ref name=Ric2015>{{cite book|last1=Hamilton|first1=Richart|title=Tarascon Pocket Pharmacopoeia 2015 Deluxe Lab-Coat Edition|date=2015|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning|isbn=9781284057560|page=9}}</ref>

== Use in horses ==
Meclofenamic acid is sold under the trade name "Arquel" for use in horses, and is administered as an oral granual form at a dose of 2.2&nbsp;mg/kg/day.<ref name="McIlwraith">McIlwraith CW, Frisbie DD, Kawcak CE. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs. Proc. AAEP 2001 (47): 182-187.</ref> It has a relatively slow onset of action, taking 36–48 hours for full effect,<ref name="Cotter">Cotter GH, Riley WF, Beck CC, Coppock RW. Arquel (Cl- 1583). A new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug for horses, in Proceedings. Am Assoc Equine Practnr 1973;19: 81–90.</ref> and is most useful for treatment of chronic musculoskeletal disease.<ref>Snow DH, Baxter P, Whiting B. The pharmacokinetics of meclofenamic acid in the horse. J Vet Pharmacol Ther 1981; 4:147–156.</ref> It has been found to be beneficial for the treatment of [[navicular syndrome]], [[laminitis]], and osteoarthritis,<ref name="Cotter" /> in some cases having a more profound effect than the commonly used NSAID [[phenylbutazone]].<ref name=Lees>Lees P, Higgins AJ. Clinical pharmacology in therapeutic uses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the horse. Equine Vet J 1985;17:83–96.</ref> However, due to cost, it is not routinely used in practice. Toxicity due to excessive dosage is similar to that of phenylbutazone, including depression, [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], weight loss, [[edema]], [[diarrhea]], oral ulceration, and decreased [[hematocrit]].<ref name=Lees />
