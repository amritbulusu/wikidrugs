==Medical uses==
Salbutamol is typically used to treat [[bronchospasm]] (due to any cause – allergic [[asthma]] or exercise-induced), as well as [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]].<ref name=AHFS2015 /> It is also one of the most common medicines used in rescue inhalers (short-term bronchodilators to alleviate [[asthma attacks]]).<ref name=webmd>{{Cite web | last=Hatfield | first=Heather | title=Asthma: The Rescue Inhaler -- Now a Cornerstone of Asthma Treatment | work=WebMD | accessdate=2017-06-27 | url=http://www.webmd.com/asthma/features/asthma-rescue-inhaler-cornerstone-asthma-treatment | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170716061632/http://www.webmd.com/asthma/features/asthma-rescue-inhaler-cornerstone-asthma-treatment | archivedate=2017-07-16 | df= }}</ref>

As a β<sub>2</sub> agonist, salbutamol also has use in [[obstetrics]]. Intravenous salbutamol can be used as a [[tocolysis|tocolytic]] to relax the [[uterus|uterine]] [[smooth muscle]] to delay [[premature labor]]. While preferred over agents such as [[atosiban]] and [[ritodrine]], its role has largely been replaced by the calcium channel blocker [[nifedipine]], which is more effective, better tolerated, and administered orally.<ref name="rossi">{{cite book|title=Australian Medicines Handbook|last=Rossi|first=S|publisher=AMH|year=2004|isbn=0-9578521-4-2|location=|pages=}}</ref>

Salbutamol has been used to treat acute [[hyperkalemia]], as it stimulates potassium flow into cells, thus lowering the level in the blood.<ref name=Mah2005/>

==Adverse effects==
The most common side effects are fine [[tremor]], [[anxiety]], [[headache]], [[muscle cramps]], [[dry mouth]], and [[palpitation]].<ref name=BNF57>{{cite book |title=British National Formulary |publisher=[[BMJ Publishing Group Ltd]] and [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain|Royal Pharmaceutical Society Publishing]] |location=London |date=March 2008 |edition=57 |chapter=3.1.1.1 Selective beta2 agonists – side effects |pages=|isbn=0-85369-778-7 |oclc= |doi= }}</ref> Other symptoms may include [[tachycardia]], [[arrhythmia]], [[Flushing (physiology)|flushing of the skin]], [[myocardial ischemia]] (rare), and disturbances of sleep and behaviour.<ref name=BNF57/> Rarely occurring, but of importance, are allergic reactions of [[Paradoxical reaction|paradoxical]] bronchospasms, [[urticaria]] (hives), [[angioedema]], [[hypotension]], and [[Collapse (medical)|collapse]].

==Pharmacology==
The [[tertiary butyl group]] in salbutamol makes it more selective for β<sub>2</sub> receptors,<ref name="Lemke2013">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sd6ot9ul-bUC&pg=PA1315|title=Foye's Principles of Medicinal Chemistry|last2=Williams|first2=D.A.|last3=Roche|first3=V.F.|last4=Zito|first4=S.W.|date=2013|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|year=|isbn=9781609133450|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=1314–1320|oclc=748675182|last1=Lemke|first1=T.L.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908175627/https://books.google.com/books?id=Sd6ot9ul-bUC&pg=PA1315|archivedate=2017-09-08|df=}}</ref> which are the predominant receptors on the bronchial [[smooth muscles]]. Activation of these receptors causes [[adenylyl cyclase]] to convert ATP to [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]], beginning the [[signalling cascade]] that ends with the inhibition of [[myosin]] phosphorylation and lowering the intracellular concentration of calcium ions (myosin phosphorylation and calcium ions are necessary for muscle contractions). The increase in cAMP also inhibits inflammatory cells in the airway, such as [[basophils]], [[eosinophils]], and most especially [[mast cells]], from releasing inflammatory mediators and cytokines.<ref name=rxlist /><ref>{{Cite book | last=Papich | first=Mark G. | title=Saunders Handbook of Veterinary Drugs | chapter=Albuterol Sulfate | location=St. Louis, Mo | date=2007 | edition=2nd | publisher=Saunders/Elsevier | isbn=9781416028888 | pages=10–11}}</ref> Salbutamol and other β<sub>2</sub> receptor agonists also increase the conductance of channels sensitive to calcium and potassium ions, leading to [[Hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarization]] and relaxation of bronchial smooth muscles.<ref name=chemm>{{cite web | last=US Department of Health and Human Services | title=Albuterol - Medical Countermeasures Database | work=CHEMM | accessdate=2017-06-23 | date=2017-04-28 | url=https://chemm.nlm.nih.gov/countermeasure_albuterol.htm | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803045423/https://chemm.nlm.nih.gov/countermeasure_albuterol.htm | archivedate=2017-08-03 | df= }}</ref>

Another study contradicts the above findings, however.

==Research==
Salbutamol has been studied in subtypes of [[congenital myasthenic syndrome]] associated with mutations in ''[[Dok-7]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Liewluck |first= Teerin |last2= Selcen |first2= Duygu |last3= Engel |first3= Andrew G. |date= November 2011 |title= Beneficial effects of albuterol in congenital endplate acetylcholinesterase deficiency and Dok-7 myasthenia |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mus.22176/abstract |journal= Muscle & Nerve |volume= 44 |issue= 5 |pages= 789–794 |doi= 10.1002/mus.22176 |pmc= 3196786 |pmid= 21952943 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151208094143/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mus.22176/abstract |archivedate= 2015-12-08 |df=  }}</ref>

It has also been tested in a trial aimed at treatment of [[spinal muscular atrophy]]; it is speculated to modulate the [[alternative splicing]] of the ''[[SMN2]]'' gene, increasing the amount of the [[survival of motor neuron|SMN protein]] whose deficiency is regarded as a cause of the disease.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Van Meerbeke | first1 = J.

==Veterinary use==
Salbutamol's low toxicity makes it safe for other animals and thus is the medication of choice for treating acute airway obstruction in most species.<ref name=merck /> It is usually used to treat bronchospasm or coughs in cats and dogs and used as a bronchodilator in horses with [[recurrent airway obstruction]]; it can also be used in emergencies to treat asthmatic cats.<ref>{{cite book | last=Plumb | first=Donald C. | title=Plumb's Veterinary Drug Handbook | chapter=Albuterol Sulfate | location=Stockholm, Wisconsin; Ames, Iowa | date=2011 | edition=7th | publisher=Wiley | isbn=9780470959640 | pages=24–25}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1=Clarke | first1=Kathy W. | last2=Trim | first2=Cynthia M. | title=Veterinary Anaesthesia E-Book | date=2013-06-28 | publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences | isbn=9780702054235 | page=612 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZh5AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA612 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908175627/https://books.google.com/books?id=hZh5AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA612 | archivedate=2017-09-08 | df= }}</ref>

Toxic effects require an extremely high dose, and most overdoses are due to dogs chewing on and puncturing an inhaler or nebulizer vial.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Cote | first=Etienne | title=Clinical Veterinary Advisor - E-Book: Dogs and Cats | chapter=Albuterol Toxicosis | date=2014-12-09 | publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences | isbn=9780323240741 | pages=45–46 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NmziBQAAQBAJ&pg=PR120 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908175627/https://books.google.com/books?id=NmziBQAAQBAJ&pg=PR120 | archivedate=2017-09-08 | df= }}</ref>
