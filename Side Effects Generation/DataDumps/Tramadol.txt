In the body it is metabolized to [[desmetramadol]], also known as ''O''-desmethyltramadol, which is a more potent opioid.<ref name="pmid22698264" />

<!-- History, society and culture -->
Tramadol was launched and marketed as "Tramal" by the German [[pharmaceutical company]] [[Grünenthal|Grünenthal GmbH]] in 1977 in [[West Germany]], and 20 years later it was launched in countries such as the UK, US, and Australia.<ref name = phr09>{{cite journal|last=Leppert|first=W|title=Tramadol as an analgesic for mild to moderate cancer pain.|journal=Pharmacological reports|date=November–December 2009|volume=61|issue=6|pages=978–92|pmid=20081232|url=http://www.if-pan.krakow.pl/pjp/pdf/2009/6_978.pdf|format=PDF|doi=10.1016/s1734-1140(09)70159-8}}</ref> It is marketed under many brand names worldwide.<ref name=generics>Drugs.com [http://www.drugs.com/international/tramadol.html International names for tramadol] Page accessed April 23, 2016</ref>

Available dosage forms include liquids, syrups, drops, elixirs, effervescent tablets and powders for mixing with water, capsules, tablets including extended release formulations, suppositories, compounding powder, and injections.<ref name = AMH/>

===Fibromyalgia===
As of 2015 tramadol was not approved in the United States for [[fibromyalgia]].<ref name=Mac2015/> Based on three small trials with weak study design, there is fair evidence for tramadol as a second line treatment.<ref name=Mac2015>{{cite journal|last1=MacLean|first1=AJ|last2=Schwartz|first2=TL|title=Tramadol for the treatment of fibromyalgia.|journal=Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics|date=May 2015|volume=15|issue=5|pages=469–75|pmid=25896486|doi=10.1586/14737175.2015.1034693}}</ref>

===Labour and delivery===
Its use as an analgesic during labour is generally advised against due to its long-onset of action (one hour).<ref name = pregrev/> The ratio of the mean concentration of the drug in the fetus compared to that of the mother when it is given intramuscularly for labour pains has been estimated to be 94.<ref name = pregrev/>

===Children===
Its use in children is generally advised against, although it may be done under the supervision of a specialist.<ref name = AMH/> On September 21, 2015 the FDA started investigating the safety of tramadol in use in persons under the age of 17.

However, according to a 2014 report by the World Health Organizations Expert Committee on Drug Dependence '"....in many cases of tramadol dependence, a history of substance abuse is present....''but''....the evidence for physical dependence was considered minimal. Consequently, Tramadol is generally considered as a drug with low potential for dependence. In a recent German study (including a literature study, an analysis of two drug safety databases, and questionnaires analyses), the low abuse and low dependence potential of Tramadol were re-confirmed. The German expert group found a low prevalence of abuse or dependence in clinical practice in Germany, and concluded that Tramadol has a low potential for misuse, abuse, and dependence in Germany”.<ref>[http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/quality_safety/6_1_Update.pdf Tramadol - Update Review Report].

Tramadol has inhibitory actions on the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor. Antagonism of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> could be partially responsible for tramadol's reducing effect on depressive and [[obsessive-compulsive disorder|obsessive–compulsive symptoms]] in patients with pain and co-morbid neurological illnesses.<ref name="pmid15105221"/> 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> blockade may also account for its lowering of the [[seizure threshold]], as 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> [[knockout mice]] display significantly increased vulnerability to epileptic seizures, sometimes resulting in spontaneous death. However, the reduction of seizure threshold could be attributed to tramadol's putative inhibition of [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors]] at high doses (significant inhibition at 100&nbsp;μM).<ref name="pmid15845694"/><ref name="pmid25776506" /> In addition, desmetramadol is a high-affinity ligand of the DOR, and activation of this receptor could be involved in tramadol's ability to provoke seizures in some individuals, as DOR agonists are well-known for inducing seizures.<ref name="pmid10991912">{{cite journal |vauthors=Potschka H, Friderichs E, Löscher W | title = Anticonvulsant and proconvulsant effects of tramadol, its enantiomers and its M1 metabolite in the rat kindling model of epilepsy | journal = Br.

===Pharmacokinetics===
[[File:O-desmethyltramadol racemate2DACS2.svg|thumb|350px|[[Desmetramadol]].]]

Tramadol undergoes [[hepatic]] metabolism via the [[cytochrome P450]] [[isozyme]] [[CYP2B6]], [[CYP2D6]] and [[CYP3A4]], being ''O''- and ''N''-demethylated to five different metabolites. Of these, [[desmetramadol]] (''O''-desmethyltramadol) is the most significant since it has 200 times the μ-affinity of (+)-tramadol, and furthermore has an elimination half-life of nine hours, compared with six hours for tramadol itself. As with codeine, in the 6% of the population that have reduced CYP2D6 activity (hence reducing metabolism), there is therefore a reduced analgesic effect. Those with decreased CYP2D6 activity require a dose increase of 30% in order to achieve the same degree of pain relief as those with a normal level of CYP2D6 activity.<ref name="pmid21494059">{{cite journal | author = Leppert W | title = CYP2D6 in the metabolism of opioids for mild to moderate pain | journal = Pharmacology | volume = 87 | issue = 5–6 | pages = 274–85 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21494059 | doi = 10.1159/000326085 }}</ref><ref name="pmid23588782">{{cite journal |vauthors=Samer CF, Lorenzini KI, Rollason V, Daali Y, Desmeules JA | title = Applications of CYP450 testing in the clinical setting | journal = Molecular Diagnosis & Therapy | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 165–84 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23588782 | pmc = 3663206 | doi = 10.1007/s40291-013-0028-5 }}</ref>

Phase II hepatic metabolism renders the metabolites water-soluble, which are excreted by the kidneys. Thus, reduced doses may be used in [[renal]] and [[hepatic]] impairment.<ref name = "Grond_Sablotzki_2004"/>

Its [[volume of distribution]] is approximately 306 L after oral administration and 203 L after parenteral administration.<ref name = Grond_Sablotzki_2004/>

==Chemistry==
Tramadol is marketed as a [[racemic mixture]] of both ''R''- and ''S''-[[stereoisomers]].<ref name = MD/> This is because the two isomers complement each other's analgesic activity.<ref name = MD/>  The (+)-isomer is predominantly active as an opiate with a higher affinity for the µ-opiate receptor (20 times higher affinity than the (-)-isomer).<ref name=UKlabel2016>{{cite web|title=Tramadol Hydrochloride 50mg Capsules |url=https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/26404|publisher=UK Electronic Medicines Compendium|accessdate=16 March 2017|language=en|date=January 2016}}</ref>

The chemical synthesis of tramadol is described in the literature.<ref name="Kleemann">Pharmaceutical Substances, Axel Kleemann, Jürgen Engel, Bernd Kutscher and Dieter Reichert, 4. ed. (2000) 2 volumes, Thieme-Verlag Stuttgart (Germany), p. 2085 bis 2086, {{ISBN|978-1-58890-031-9}}; since 2003 online with biannual actualizations.</ref> Tramadol {{nowrap|[2-(dimethylaminomethyl)-1-(3-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexanol]}} has two stereogenic centers at the [[cyclohexane]] ring. Thus, {{nowrap|2-(dimethylaminomethyl)-1-(3-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexanol}} may exist in ''four'' different configurational forms:
* (1''R'',2''R'')-isomer
* (1''S'',2''S'')-isomer
* (1''R'',2''S'')-isomer
* (1''S'',2''R'')-isomer
The synthetic pathway leads to the [[racemate]] (1:1 mixture) of (1''R'',2''R'')-isomer and the (1''S'',2''S'')-isomer as the main products. Minor amounts of the racemic mixture of the (1''R'',2''S'')-isomer and the (1''S'',2''R'')-isomer are formed as well. The isolation of the (1''R'',2''R'')-isomer and the (1''S'',2''S'')-isomer from the [[diastereomer]]ic minor racemate [(1''R'',2''S'')-isomer and (1''S'',2''R'')-isomer] is realized by the recrystallization of the [[hydrochloride]]s.
The drug tramadol is a racemate of the hydrochlorides of the (1''R'',2''R'')-(+)- and the (1''S'',2''S'')-(–)-enantiomers.

===Detection in biological fluids===
Tramadol and desmetramadol may be quantified in blood, plasma or serum to monitor for abuse, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning or assist in the forensic investigation of a sudden death. Most commercial opiate immunoassay screening tests do not cross-react significantly with tramadol or its major metabolites, so chromatographic techniques must be used to detect and quantitate these substances.

===False findings about sources in nature===
In 2013, researchers reported that tramadol was found in relatively high concentrations (1%+) in the roots of the African [[pin cushion tree]] (''Nauclea latifolia'').<ref name = Nauc>{{cite journal|title=Occurrence of the Synthetic Analgesic Tramadol in an African Medicinal Plant|vauthors=Boumendjel A, Sotoing Taïwe G, Ngo Bum E, Chabrol T, Beney C, Sinniger V, Haudecoeur R, Marcourt L, Challal S, Ferreira Queiroz E, Souard F, Le Borgne M, Lomberget T, Depaulis A, Lavaud C, Robins R, Wolfender JL, Bonaz B, De Waard M |date=November 2013|doi=10.1002/anie.201305697|volume=52|issue=45|pages=11780–84|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|pmid=24014188}}</ref> In 2014, however, it was reported that the presence of tramadol in the tree roots was the result of tramadol having been administered to cattle by farmers in the region:<ref name = crosscont>{{cite journal | author = Kusari, S., Tatsimo, S. J. N., Zühlke, S., Talontsi, F. M., Kouam, S.

Therefore, tramadol and its mammalian metabolites were found in tree roots in the far North of [[Cameroon]], but not in the South where it is not administered to farm animals.<ref name = crosscont/>

A 2014 editorial in ''Lab Times online'' contested the notion that tramadol in tree roots was the result of anthropogenic contamination, stating that samples were taken from trees which grew in national parks, where livestock were forbidden; it also quoted researcher Michel de Waard, who stated that "thousands and thousands of tramadol-treated cattle sitting around a single tree and urinating there" would be required to produce the concentrations discovered.<ref name=LabTimes>[http://www.labtimes.org/editorial/e_546.lasso Who Really did it First? Nature or a Pharmacist?], in ''Lab Times online''; by Nicola Hunt; published September 22, 2014; retrieved November 21, 2015</ref>

In 2015, [[Carbon-14|radiocarbon]] analysis confirmed that the Tramadol found in ''N.latifolia'' roots could not be plant-derived and was of synthetic origin.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Souvik|last1=Kusari|first2=Simplice Joel N.|last2=Tatsimo|first3=Sebastian|last3=Zühlke|first4=Michael|last4=Spiteller|title=Synthetic Origin of Tramadol in the Environment|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|date=4 January 2016|pages=240–43|volume=55|issue=1|doi=10.1002/anie.201508646|pmid=26473295}}</ref>

Tramadol may be used to treat post-operative, injury-related, and chronic (e.g., cancer-related) pain in dogs and cats as well as rabbits, [[coati]]s, many small mammals including [[rat]]s and [[flying squirrel]]s, [[guinea pig]]s, [[ferret]]s, and [[raccoon]]s.<ref name = Zoo>{{cite journal |vauthors=Souza MJ, Cox SK | title = Tramadol use in zoologic medicine | journal = Vet Clin North Am Exot Anim Pract | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 117–30 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21074707 | doi = 10.1016/j.cvex.2010.09.005 }}</ref>
