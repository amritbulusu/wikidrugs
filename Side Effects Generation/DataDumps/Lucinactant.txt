'''Lucinactant''' (trade name '''Surfaxin''') is a liquid medication used to treat [[infant respiratory distress syndrome]].<ref>[http://www.discoverylabs.com/surfaxin.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420135625/http://www.discoverylabs.com/surfaxin.html |date=April 20, 2009 }}</ref> It is a [[pulmonary surfactant]] for infants who lack enough natural surfactant in their lungs. Whereas earlier medicines of the class, such as [[beractant]], [[calfactant]], and poractant, are derived from animals, lucinactant is [[organic synthesis|synthetic]]. It was approved for use in the United States by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on March 6, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm294984.htm |title=FDA approves Surfaxin to prevent breathing disorder in premature infants |publisher=Fda.gov |date=2012-03-06 |accessdate=2012-10-20}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
Lucinactant is indicated to improve lung function and reduce duration and risk of [[mechanical ventilation]] in children. It can be used up to two years of age and is specified for children who are diagnosed with acute [[respiratory failure]] following exposure to a pathogen such as [[Human respiratory syncytial virus|RSV]] or [[influenza]], including [[H1N1]].<ref name="POPG, a Key Component of Discovery Labs' KL4 Surfactant, Identified as a Novel Anti-Viral Therapeutic Approach">{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/globenewswire/182115.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122205312/http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/globenewswire/182115.htm |archivedate=January 22, 2010 }}</ref><ref name="Bronchopulmonary segmental lavage with Surfaxin (KL(4)-surfactant) for acute respiratory distress syndrome.">{{Cite journal

==Chemistry==
Lucinactant contains the peptide [[sinapultide]] (KL4 acetate), [[Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine|1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine]], [[1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol]] (as the sodium salt), and [[palmitic acid]].

==History==
The scientific groundwork for lucinactant was laid in the laboratory of Charles Cochrane at The [[Scripps Research Institute]] in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scripps.edu/news/press/20120306cochrane.html |title=Scripps Research Discoveries Lead to Newly Approved Drug for Infant Respiratory Distress Syndrome |publisher=Scripps.edu |date=2012-03-06 |accessdate=2012-10-20}}</ref> The drug was then developed by Discovery Laboratories of [[Warrington Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Warrington, PA]]. The path through the approval process was unusually long, reflecting in part challenges in the manufacturing process that needed to be addressed before approval was granted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmacychoice.com/news/article.cfm?Article_ID=854519 |title=Pharmaceutical News - Discovery Labs Turns Focus To Surfaxin Market Strategy - October 20, 2012 |publisher=Pharmacy Choice |date= |accessdate=2012-10-20}}</ref>

==Legal status==
Lucinactant is listed as an [[orphan drug|Orphan Drug Product]] by the US Food and Drug Administration for several conditions:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://google2.fda.gov/search?q=cache:LCsiKMwG2v0J:www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dailys/00/mar00/030100/lst0094.pdf+surfaxin&client=FDAgov&site=FDAgov&lr=&proxystylesheet=FDAgov&output=xml_no_dtd&ie=UTF-8&access=p&oe=UTF-8 |title=List Of Orphan Products Designations And Approvals |publisher=Google2.fda.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-10-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nelm.nhs.uk/en/NeLM-Area/News/485098/485446/485460/ |title=Page expired |publisher=Nelm.nhs.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-20}}</ref>

Clinical trials in Latin America were criticized for protocol based in potentially unethical principles.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Charatan|first=Fred|title=Surfactant trial in Latin American infants criticised|journal=BMJ|date=10 March 2001|volume=322|series=7286|page=575|pmc=1119782|pmid=11238147|doi=10.1136/bmj.322.7286.575/b}}</ref>  A placebo was used and considered ethical by design since infants born in Latin America usually do not have access to life saving treatment. The intent of Discovery Labs was always to market Surfaxin in the United States, implying burdens on the Latin American children that outweighed the benefits.
