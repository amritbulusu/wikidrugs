'''Daptomycin''' is a [[lipopeptide]] [[antibiotic]] used in the treatment of systemic and life-threatening infections caused by [[Gram-positive]] organisms. It is a naturally occurring compound found in the soil [[saprotroph]] ''[[Streptomyces roseosporus]]''. Its distinct mechanism of action makes it useful in treating infections caused by multiple drug-resistant bacteria. It is marketed in the United States under the trade name Cubicin by [[Cubist Pharmaceuticals]].

== History ==
Daptomycin, originally designated as LY 146032, was discovered by researchers at [[Eli Lilly and Company]] in the late 1980s. LY 146032 showed promise in phase I/II [[clinical trial]]s for treatment of infection caused by Gram-positive organisms. Lilly ceased development because high-dose therapy was associated with adverse effects on skeletal muscle, including [[myalgia]] and potential [[myositis]].

The rights to LY 146032 were acquired by Cubist Pharmaceuticals in 1997, which following U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approval in September 2003 for use in people older than 18 years, began marketing the drug under the trade name Cubicin. Cubicin is marketed in the EU and in several other countries by [[Novartis]] following its purchase of [[Chiron Corporation]], the previous licensee.<ref name=Tally2000>{{cite journal |authors=Tally FP, DeBruin MF |title=Development of daptomycin for gram-positive infections |journal=[[J Antimicrob Chemother]]. |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=523–6 |date=October 2000|pmid=11020247 |url=http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11020247 |doi=10.1093/jac/46.4.523}}</ref><ref name="Charles 2004">{{cite journal |authors=Charles PG, Grayson ML |title=The dearth of new antibiotic development: why we should be worried and what we can do about it |journal=Med J Aust. |volume=181 |issue=10 |pages=549–53 |date=November 2004|pmid=15540967 |url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/181_10_151104/cha10412_fm.html}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Daptomycin has a distinct mechanism of action, disrupting multiple aspects of bacterial [[cell membrane]] function. It inserts into the cell membrane in a [[phosphatidylglycerol]]-dependent fashion, where it then aggregates. The aggregation of daptomycin alters the curvature of the membrane, which creates holes that leak ions. This causes rapid [[depolarization]], resulting in a loss of membrane potential leading to inhibition of [[protein]], [[DNA]], and [[RNA]] synthesis, which results in bacterial cell death.<ref name="Pogliano 2012">{{cite journal |authors=Pogliano J, Pogliano, N, Silverman, JA |title=Daptomycin-Mediated Reorganization of Membrane Architecture Causes Mislocalization of Essential Cell Division Proteins |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=194 |issue=17 |pages=4494–4504 |date=September 2012|pmid=22661688 |doi=10.1128/JB.00011-12 |pmc=3415520}}</ref>

== Microbiology ==
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}
Daptomycin is bactericidal against Gram-positive bacteria only. It has proven ''in vitro'' activity against [[Enterococcus|enterococci]] (including [[glycopeptide]]-resistant enterococci (GRE)), [[Staphylococcus|staphylococci]] (including [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']])[[Streptococcus|streptococci]], [[Corynebacterium|corynebacteria]] and stationary-phase ''[[Borrelia burgdorferi]]'' persisters.

== Daptomycin resistance ==
Daptomycin resistance is still uncommon, but has been increasingly reported in GRE, starting in Korea in 2005, in Europe in 2010, in Taiwan 2011, and in the USA, where nine cases have been reported from 2007 to 2011.<ref>Daptomycin-Nonsusceptible Enterococcal Infections; Cleveland, Kerry O. MD; Gelfand, Michael S. MD; Infect Dis Clin Pract 2013;21: 79-84.</ref> Daptomycin resistance emerged in five of the six cases while they were treated. The mechanism of resistance is unknown. A 4 million year-old strain of ''[[Paenibacillus]]'' isolated from soil samples in [[Lechuguilla Cave]] was found to be naturally resistant to daptomycin.<ref name="Pawlowski 2016">{{cite journal|last1=Pawlowski|first1=Andrew C.|title=A diverse intrinsic antibiotic resistome from a cave bacterium|journal=[[Nature Communications]]|date=2016|volume=7|doi=10.1038/ncomms13803|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13803|pmid=27929110|page=13803}}</ref>

== Clinical use ==

===Indications===
Daptomycin is approved for use in adults in the United States for [[skin and skin structure infection]]s caused by Gram-positive infections, ''S. aureus'' bacteraemia, and right-sided ''S. aureus'' [[endocarditis]].

=== Efficacy ===
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}
Daptomycin has been shown to be non-inferior to standard therapies ([[nafcillin]], [[oxacillin]], [[flucloxacillin]] or [[vancomycin]]) in the treatment of [[bacteraemia]] and right-sided endocarditis caused by ''S. aureus''.<ref>{{cite journal| authors=Fowler VG, Boucher HW, Corey GR| title=Daptomycin versus standard therapy for bacteremia and endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus aureus| journal=N Engl J Med| volume=355| issue=7| pages=653–65| date=Aug 2006| pmid=16914701| doi=10.1056/NEJMoa053783 }}</ref>  A study in [[Detroit, Michigan]] compared 53 patients treated for suspected [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] skin or soft tissue infection with daptomycin against vancomycin, showing faster recovery (4 versus 7 days) with daptomycin.<ref>{{cite journal| authors=Davis SL, McKinnon PS, Hall LM| journal=Pharmacotherapy| year=2007| volume=27| issue=12| pages=1611&ndash;1618| url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/569439| pmid=18041881| doi=10.1592/phco.27.12.1611| title=Daptomycin versus vancomycin for complicated skin and skin structure infections: clinical and economic outcomes.}}</ref>

In phase III clinical trials, limited data showed daptomycin to be associated with poor outcomes in patients with left-sided endocarditis.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} Daptomycin has not been studied in patients with [[prosthetic heart valve|prosthetic valve]] endocarditis or meningitis.<ref name=Cubist2005>Cubicin (daptomycin for injection) [homepage on the Internet]. Lexington (MA): Cubist Pharmaceuticals; c2003–06 [updated 2006 May 27; cited 2006 Aug 20]. Available from: http://www.cubicin.com/home.htm</ref>

=== Dosage and presentation ===
In skin and soft tissue infections, 4&nbsp;mg/kg daptomycin is given intravenously once daily.  For ''S. aureus'' bacteraemia or right-sided endocarditis, the approved dose is 6&nbsp;mg/kg given intravenously once daily.

Daptomycin is given every 48 hours in patients with renal impairment with a creatinine clearance of less than 30 ml/min.  No information is available on dosing in people less than 18 years of age.

Daptomycin is supplied as a sterile, preservative-free, pale yellow to light brown, lyophilised 500- or 350-mg cake that must be reconstituted with normal saline prior to use.

Daptomycin is applicable as 30-min infusion or 2-min injection.

=== Adverse effects ===
Common adverse drug reactions associated with daptomycin therapy include:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/021572s046lbl.pdf |title=www.accessdata.fda.gov |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name="MicromedexDrugdex">Daptomycin.

*Cardiovascular: [[hypotension|low blood pressure]], [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[edema|swelling]]
*Central nervous system: insomnia
*Dermatological: rash
*Gastrointestinal: diarrhea,  abdominal pain
*Hematological: [[eosinophilia]]
*Respiratory: [[dyspnea]]
*Other: injection site reactions, fever, [[hypersensitivity]]

Also, [[myopathy]] and [[rhabdomyolysis]] have been reported in patients simultaneously taking [[statin]]s,<ref>Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy. 63(6):1299-300, 2009 Jun.</ref> but whether this is due entirely to the statin or whether daptomycin potentiates this effect is unknown. Due to the limited data available, the manufacturer recommends that statins be temporarily discontinued while the patient is receiving daptomycin therapy. [[Creatine kinase]] levels are usually checked regularly while individuals undergo daptomycin therapy.

In July 2010, the FDA issued a warning that daptomycin could cause life-threatening [[eosinophilic pneumonia]]. The FDA said it had identified seven confirmed cases of eosinophilic pneumonia between 2004 and 2010 and an additional 36 possible cases. The seven confirmed victims were all older than 60 and symptoms appeared within two weeks of initiation of therapy.

Chemother. |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=283–8 |date=March 2005|pmid=15705644 |doi=10.1093/jac/dkh546 }}</ref>  Daptomycin consists of 13 amino acids, 10 of which are arranged in a cyclic fashion, and three on an exocyclic tail. Two nonproteinogenic amino acids exist in the lipopeptide, the unusual amino acid L-kynurenine (Kyn), only known to daptomycin, and L-3-methylglutamic acid (mGlu). The N-terminus of the exocyclic tryptophan residue is coupled to decanoic acid, a medium-chain (C10) fatty acid. Biosynthesis is initiated by the coupling of decanoic acid to the N-terminal [[tryptophan]], followed by the coupling of the remaining amino acids by nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) mechanisms.  Finally, a cyclization event occurs, which is catalyzed by a thioesterase enzyme, and subsequent release of the lipopeptide is granted.  
   
The NRPS responsible for the synthesis of daptomycin is encoded by three [[overlapping genes]],'' dptA, dptBC'' and ''dptD''. The ''dptE'' and ''dptF'' genes, immediately upstream of'' dptA'', are likely to be involved in the initiation of daptomycin biosynthesis by coupling decanoic acid to the N-terminal Trp.<ref name=Mchenney>{{cite journal |authors=Mchenney MA, Hosted TJ, Dehoff BS, Rosteck PR, Baltz RH |title=Molecular cloning and physical mapping of the daptomycin gene cluster from Streptomyces roseosporus |journal=J Bacteriol. |volume=180 |issue=1 |pages=143–51 |date=1 January 1998|pmid=9422604 |pmc=106860 |url=http://jb.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9422604 }}</ref> These novel genes (dptE, dptF ) correspond to products that most likely work in conjunction with a unique [[condensation domain]] to acylate the first amino acid (tryptophan).  These and other novel genes (''dptI, dptJ'') are believed to be involved in supplying the nonproteinogenic amino acids L-3-methylglutamic acid and Kyn; they are located next to the NRPS genes.<ref name=Mchenney/>

The decanoic acid portion of daptomycin is synthesized by fatty acid synthase machinery (Figure 2).  Post-translational modification of the apo-acyl carrier protein (ACP, thiolation, or T domain) by a phosphopantetheinyltransferase (PPTase) enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a flexible phosphopantetheine arm from coenzyme A to a conserved serine in the ACP domain through a phosphodiester linkage.  The holo-ACP can provide a thiol on which the substrate and acyl chains are covalently bound during chain elongations.  The two core catalytic domains are an acyltransferase (AT) and a ketosynthase (KS).  The AT acts upon a malonyl-CoA substrate and transfers an acyl group to the thiol of the ACP domain.  This net transthiolation is an energy-neutral step.  Next, the acyl-S-ACP gets transthiolated to a conserved cysteine on the KS; the KS decarboxylates the downstream malonyl-S-ACP and forms a β-ketoacyl-S-ACP.  This serves as the substrate for the next cycle of elongation. Before the next cycle begins, however, the β-keto group undergoes reduction to the corresponding alcohol catalyzed by a ketoreductase domain, followed by dehydration to the olefin catalyzed by a dehydratase domain, and finally reduction to the methylene catalyzed by an enoylreductase domain.  Each KS catalytic cycle results in the net addition of two carbons.  After three more iterations of elongation, a thioesterase enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis, and thus release, of the free C-10 fatty acid.
   
To synthesize the peptide portion of daptomycin, the mechanism of an NRPS is employed.  The biosynthetic machinery of an NRPS system is composed of multimodular enzymatic assembly lines that contain one module for each amino acid monomer incorporated.<ref name=Fischbach>{{cite journal |authors=Fischbach MA, Walsh CT |title=Assembly-line enzymology for polyketide and nonribosomal Peptide antibiotics: logic, machinery, and mechanisms |journal=Chem. Rev. |volume=106 |issue=8 |pages=3468–96 |date=August 2006|pmid=16895337 |doi=10.1021/cr0503097 }}</ref>   Within each module are catalytic domains that carry out the elongation of the growing peptidyl chain.  The growing peptide is covalently tethered to a thiolation domain; here it is termed the peptidyl carrier protein, as it carries the growing peptide from one catalytic domain to the next.  Again, the apo-T domain must be primed to the holo-T domain by a PPTase, attaching a flexible phosphopantetheine arm to a conserved serine residue.  An adenylation domain selects the amino acid monomer to be incorporated and activates the carboxylate with ATP to make the aminoacyl-AMP.  Next, the A domain installs an aminoacyl group on the thiolate of the adjacent T domain.  The condensation (C) domain catalyzes the peptide bond forming reaction, which elicits chain elongation. It joins an upstream peptidyl-S-T to the downstream aminoacyl-S-T (Figure 7).  Chain elongation by one aminoacyl residue and chain translocation to the next T domain occurs in concert. The order of these domains is C-A-T.  In some instances, an epimerization domain is necessary in those modules where L-amino acid monomers are to be incorporated and epimerized to D-amino acids.  The domain organization in such modules is C-A-T-E.<ref name=Fischbach/>

The first module has a three-domain C-A-T organization; these often occur in assembly lines that make N-acylated peptides.<ref name=Fischbach/> The first C domain catalyzes N-acylation of the initiating amino acid (tryptophan) while it is installed on T.  An adenylating enzyme (Ad) catalyzes the condensation of decanoic acid and the N-terminal tryptophan, which incorporates decanoic acid into the growing peptide (Figure 3). The genes responsible for this coupling event are dptE and dptF, which are located upstream of dptA, the first gene of the Daptomycin NRPS biosynthetic gene cluster.  Once the coupling of decanoic acid to the N-terminal tryptophan residue occurs, the condensation of amino acids begins, catalyzed by the NRPS.

The first five modules of the NRPS are encoded by the ''dptA'' gene and catalyze the condensation of L-tryptophan, D-asparagine, L-aspartate, L-threonine, and glycine, respectively (Figure 4).  Modules 6-11, which catalyze the condensation of L-ornithine, L-aspartate, D-alanine, L-aspartate, glycine, and D-serine are encoded for the ''dptBC'' gene (Figure 5). ''dptD'' catalyzes the incorporation of two nonproteinogenic amino acids, L-3-methylglutamic acid (mGlu) and Kyn, which is only known thus far to daptomycin, into the growing peptide (Figure 6).<ref name=Steenbergen/>  Elongation by these NRPS modules ultimately leads to macrocyclization and release in which an α-amino group, namely threonine, acts as an internal nucleophile during cyclization to yield the 10-amino-acid ring (Figure 6).

New derivatives of daptomycin (Figure 9) were originally generated by exchanging the third NRPS subunit (''dptD'') with the terminal subunits from the A54145 (Factor B1) or calcium-dependent antibiotic pathways to create molecules containing Trp13, Ile13, or Val13.<ref name=Miao/> ''dptD'' is responsible for incorporating the penultimate amino acid, 3-methyl-glutamic acid (3mGlu12), and the last amino acid, Kyn13, into the chain.  This exchange was achieved without engineering the interpeptide docking sites. These whole-subunit exchanges have been coupled with the deletion of the Glu12-methyltransferase gene, with module exchanges at intradomain linker sites at Ala8 and Ser11, and with variations of natural fatty-acid side chains to generate over 70 novel lipopeptides in significant quantities; most of these resultant lipopeptides have potent antibacterial activities.<ref name=Nguyen/><ref name=Miao>{{cite journal |authors=Miao V, Coëffet-Le Gal MF, Nguyen K |title=Genetic engineering in Streptomyces roseosporus to produce hybrid lipopeptide antibiotics |journal=Chem Biol. |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=269–76 |date=March 2006|pmid=16638532 |doi=10.1016/j.chembiol.2005.12.012 }}</ref> Some of these compounds have ''in vitro'' antibacterial activities analogous to daptomycin. Further, one displayed ameliorated activity against an ''E. coli'' imp mutant that was defective in its ability to assemble its inherent lipopolysaccharide. A number of these compounds were produced in yields that spanned from 100 to 250&nbsp;mg/liter; this, of course, opens up the possibility for successful scale-ups by fermentation techniques. Only a small percentage of the possible combinations of amino acids within the peptide core have been investigated thus far.<ref name=Baltz17160059>{{cite journal |author=Baltz RH |title=Molecular engineering approaches to peptide, polyketide and other antibiotics |journal=Nat.
