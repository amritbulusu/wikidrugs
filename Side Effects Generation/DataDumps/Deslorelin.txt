'''Deslorelin''' acetate is an injectable [[gonadotropin releasing hormone]] super-agonist ([[GnRH agonist]]) also known as an LHRH agonist. Via its indirect action, following an initial surge the production of sex hormones ([[Androgen]] and [[Estrogen]]) tapers off.

One commercial form of Deslorelin Acetate is marketed by [[Peptech]] with the brand name '''Ovuplant'''.<ref>[http://www.ovuplant.com/ Peptech official Ovuplant site]</ref> Another form is available in the USA, '''Sucromate Equine''',<ref>[http://www.sucromate.com/ Thorne BioScience official Sucromate site]</ref> which was FDA-approved for use in horses in November 2010.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/SafetyHealth/ProductSafetyInformation/ucm242743.htm FDA Approval Release]</ref> This is manufactured by Thorne BioScience LLC and was introduced to the USA market following the withdrawal of Ovuplant. The Deslorelin products are currently approved for use in veterinary medicine and to promote [[ovulation]] in mares as part of the [[artificial insemination]] process. It is also used to stabilize high-risk pregnancies, mainly of [[livestock]]. Unlike other GnRH agonists, which are mainly used to inhibit [[luteinizing hormone]] and [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] by their ultimate [[downregulation and upregulation|downregulation]] of the [[pituitary gland]], Deslorelin is primarily used for the initial flare effect upon the pituitary, and its associated surge of LH secretion. '''Suprelorin''' is a slowly releasing deslorelin implant used for chemical castration of dogs and ferrets. It is marketed by Virbac. Deslorelin is also used to treat benign prostate hyperplasia in dogs.

[[Buserelin]] is a similar GnRH agonist used in humans.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Deslorelin is a synthetic analogue of a naturally occurring luteinising-hormone releasing hormone ([[LHRH]]). Bioavailability is almost complete.

==Clinical trials==

Deslorelin was successfully trialed in the US and was approved for veterinary use under certain circumstances. In Europe, it was approved for use in [[equine]] [[assisted reproduction]].<ref>[http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/vet/mrls/083002en.pdf Deslorelin Acetate] - European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products</ref>

Ovuplant was withdrawn from the US market following issues with mares which did not become pregnant failing to return to estrus in a timely manner. Techniques were developed where the implant was removed 48 hours after implantation in the mare,<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 12212887 | volume=58 | title=Removal of deslorelin (Ovuplant) implant 48 h after administration results in normal interovulatory intervals in mares | journal=Theriogenology | pages=865â€“70 | last1 = McCue | first1 = PM | last2 = Farquhar | first2 = VJ | last3 = Carnevale | first3 = EM | last4 = Squires | first4 = EL | doi=10.1016/s0093-691x(02)00923-8}}</ref> however compounded biorelease Deslorelin products were at the time available as well as more commonly used ovulation promoters such as [[Human chorionic gonadotropin|hCG]], which did not produce the same failure effect. Upon "Sucromate Equine" receiving FDA-approval, the compounded products were no longer legally available within the USA, however they remain available in Australia and New Zealand where an approved version is marketed.

It is also being trialed in humans to study its efficacy in treatment of [[breast cancer]] in women,<ref>[http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00080756?intr=%22Deslorelin%22 Deslorelin Combined With Low-Dose Add-Back Estradiol and Testosterone in Preventing Breast Cancer in Premenopausal Women Who Are at High Risk for This Disease] - [[National Cancer Institute]]</ref> and in treating [[precocious puberty]] and [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] in male and female children.<ref>[http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00001521?intr=%22Deslorelin%22 Three Drug Combination Therapy Versus Conventional Treatment of Children With Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia] - [[National Institutes of Health|National Institutes of Health Clinical Center]]</ref>

As of August 2011 this drug was not approved for general use outside the FDA-licensed functions in the US, other than within approved clinical trials. [[Orphan drug|Orphan drug status]] has been designated in the US, though approval had not been issued as of 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Results for Orphan Drug Product Designations Search|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/opdlisting/oopd/OOPD_Results_2.cfm?Index_Number=016086|publisher=FDA|accessdate=3 September 2011}}</ref>
