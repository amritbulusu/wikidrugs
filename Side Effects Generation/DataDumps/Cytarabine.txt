==Medical uses==
Cytarabine is mainly used in the treatment of [[acute myeloid leukaemia]], [[acute lymphocytic leukaemia]] (ALL) and in [[lymphoma]]s,<ref name="pmid18024370">{{cite journal |vauthors=Pigneux A, Perreau V, Jourdan E |title=Adding lomustine to idarubicin and cytarabine for induction chemotherapy in older patients with acute myeloid leukemia: the BGMT 95 trial results |journal=Haematologica |volume=92 |issue=10 |pages=1327–34 |date=October 2007 |pmid=18024370 |doi=10.3324/haematol.11068 |url=http://www.haematologica.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18024370|display-authors=etal}}</ref> where it is the backbone of [[induction chemotherapy]].

Cytarabine also possesses [[Antiviral drug|antiviral]] activity, and it has been used for the treatment of generalised [[herpesvirus]] infection. However, cytarabine is not very selective in this setting and causes [[bone marrow suppression]] and other severe side effects.
Therefore, ara-C is not a useful antiviral agent in humans because of its toxic profile<ref name="pmid15825312">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Lauter | first1 = CB. | last2 = Bailey | first2 = EJ. | last3 = Lerner | first3 = AM. | title = Assessment of cytosine arabinoside as an antiviral agent in humans. | journal = Antimicrob Agents Chemother | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 598–602 |date=Nov 1974 | doi =  10.1128/aac.6.5.598| PMID = 15825312 | pmc=444699}}</ref> and actually it is used mainly for the chemotherapy of hematologic [[cancers]].

Cytarabine is also used in the study of the [[nervous system]] to control the proliferation of [[glial]] cells in cultures, the amount of glial cells having an important impact on [[neuron]]s.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Side effects==
One of the unique toxicities of cytarabine is [[cerebellar]] toxicity when given in high doses, which may lead to [[ataxia]].  Cytarabine may cause [[granulocytopenia]] and other impaired body defenses, which may lead to infection, and [[thrombocytopenia]], which may lead to [[hemorrhage]].

Toxicity:  [[leukopenia]], thrombocytopenia, [[anemia]], GI disturbances, [[stomatitis]], [[conjunctivitis]], [[pneumonitis]], [[fever]], and [[dermatitis]], [[Chemotherapy-induced acral erythema|palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia]].  Rarely, [[myelopathy]] has been reported after high dose or frequent [[intrathecal]] Ara-C administration.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Watterson J, Toogood I, Nieder M | title = Excessive spinal cord toxicity from intensive central nervous system-directed therapies| journal = Cancer| volume = 74| issue = 11| pages = 3034–41| date=December 1994| pmid = 7954266| doi = 10.1002/1097-0142(19941201)74:11<3034::AID-CNCR2820741122>3.0.CO;2-O|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

When used in protocols designated as high dose, cytarabine can cause cerebral and cerebellar dysfunction, ocular toxicity, pulmonary toxicity, severe GI ulceration and [[peripheral neuropathy]] (rare).

To prevent the side effects and improve the therapeutic efficiency, various derivatives of these drugs (including amino acid, peptide, fatty acid and phosphates) have been evaluated, as well as different delivery systems.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chhikara BS, Parang K |title =Development of cytarabine prodrugs and delivery systems for leukemia treatment |journal = Expert Opinion on Drug Delivery |volume = 7 |issue = 12 |pages = 1399–1414 |year = 2010 |doi = 10.1517/17425247.2010.527330 |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1517/17425247.2010.527330 }}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Cytosine arabinoside combines a [[cytosine]] base with an [[arabinose]] sugar. It is an [[antimetabolic agent]] with the chemical name of ''1β-arabinofuranosylcytosine''. Certain sponges, where it was originally found, use arabinoside sugars to form a different compound (not part of DNA). Cytosine arabinoside is similar enough to human cytosine deoxyribose (deoxycytidine) to be incorporated into human DNA, but different enough that it kills the cell. Cytosine arabinoside interferes with the synthesis of DNA. Its mode of action is due to its rapid conversion into [[cytosine arabinoside triphosphate]], which damages [[DNA]] when the [[cell cycle]] holds in the [[S phase]] (synthesis of DNA). Rapidly dividing cells, which require DNA replication for [[mitosis]], are therefore most affected. Cytosine arabinoside also inhibits both [[DNA polymerase|DNA]]<ref name="isbn0-7817-7328-8">{{cite book |author=Perry, Michael J. |title=The Chemotherapy source book |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |year=2008 |pages=80 |isbn=0-7817-7328-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> and [[RNA polymerase]]s and [[nucleotide]] reductase enzymes needed for DNA synthesis. Cytarabine is the first of a series of cancer drugs that altered the sugar component of [[nucleosides]]. Other cancer drugs modify the base.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pfeist.net/ALL/arac/ | title = A Tale from the Sea to Ara C | last = Feist | first = Patty | date = April 2005 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070306220251/http://www.pfeist.net/ALL/arac/ | archivedate = 2007-03-06 | df =  }}</ref>

Cytarabine was first synthesized in 1959 by Richard Walwick, Walden Roberts, and Charles Dekker at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref name=Sneader>{{cite book| author = Sneader, Walter| title = Drug discovery: a history| publisher = Wiley| location = New York| year = 2005| page = 258| isbn = 0-471-89979-8| oclc = }}</ref>

It was approved by the [[United States]] [[Food and Drug Administration]] in June 1969, and was initially marketed in the U.S. by [[Upjohn]] under the [[trade name]] Cytosar-U.
