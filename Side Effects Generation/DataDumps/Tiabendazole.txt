'''Tiabendazole''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]]), '''thiabendazole''' ([[Australian Approved Name|AAN]], [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]), '''TBZ''' (and the trade names Mintezol, Tresaderm, and Arbotect) is a [[fungicide]] and [[parasite|parasiticide]].

== Uses ==

=== Fungicide ===
It is used primarily to control [[mold]], [[blight]], and other fungal diseases in fruits (e.g. [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]]) and vegetables; it is also used as a [[prophylaxis|prophylactic]] treatment for [[Dutch elm disease]].

Use in treatment of [[aspergillosis]] has been reported.<ref name="pmid6766732">{{cite journal |vauthors=Upadhyay MP, West EP, Sharma AP |title=Keratitis due to Aspergillus flavus successfully treated with thiabendazole |journal=Br J Ophthalmol |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=30–2 |date=January 1980 |pmid=6766732 |pmc=1039343 |doi= 10.1136/bjo.64.1.30|url=http://bjo.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=6766732}}</ref>

Used in anti-fungal Purple wallboards (optiSHIELD AT, mixture of [[Azoxystrobin]] and Thiabendazole).

=== Parasiticide ===
As an antiparasitic, it is able to control [[roundworm]]s (such as those causing  [[strongyloidiasis]]),<ref name="pmid15571478">{{cite journal |vauthors=Igual-Adell R, Oltra-Alcaraz C, Soler-Company E, Sánchez-Sánchez P, Matogo-Oyana J, Rodríguez-Calabuig D |title=Efficacy and safety of ivermectin and thiabendazole in the treatment of strongyloidiasis |journal=Expert Opin Pharmacother |volume=5 |issue=12 |pages=2615–9 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15571478 |doi=10.1517/14656566.5.12.2615 |url=http://www.informapharmascience.com/doi/abs/10.1517/14656566.5.12.2615}}</ref> [[hookworm]]s, and other [[helminth]] species which attack wild animals, [[livestock]] and humans.<ref name="pmid12031927">{{cite journal |vauthors=Portugal R, Schaffel R, Almeida L, Spector N, Nucci M |title=Thiabendazole for the prophylaxis of strongyloidiasis in immunosuppressed patients with hematological diseases: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study |journal=Haematologica |volume=87 |issue=6 |pages=663–4 |date=June 2002 |pmid=12031927 |doi= |url=http://www.haematologica.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12031927}}</ref>

=== Angiogenesis inhibitor ===
Genes responsible for the maintenance of cell walls in yeast have been shown to be responsible for [[angiogenesis]] in vertebrates. Tiabendazole serves to block angiogenesis in both frog embryos and human cells. It has also been shown to serve as a vascular disrupting agent to reduce newly established blood vessels. Tiabendazole has been shown to effectively do this in certain cancer cells.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cha|first=HJ|author2=Byrom M |author3=Mead PE |author4=Ellington AD |author5=Wallingford JB |title=Evolutionarily Repurposed Networks Reveal the Well-Known Antifungal Drug Thiabendazole to Be a Novel Vascular Disrupting Agent|journal=PLoS Biology|date=August 2012|volume=10|issue=8|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001379|url=http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001379|accessdate=2012-08-21|display-authors=etal |pmid=22927795 |pmc=3423972 |pages=e1001379}}</ref>

== Pharmacodynamics ==
TBZ works by inhibition of the mitochondrial, helminth-specific enzyme, fumarate reductase, with possible interaction with endogenous quinone.<ref>Gilman, A.G., T.W. Rall, A.S. Nies and P. Taylor (eds.). Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. 8th ed. New York, NY. Pergamon Press, 1990., p. 970</ref>

== Other ==
Medicinally, thiabendazole is also a [[chelating agent]], which means it is used medicinally to bind metals in cases of metal poisoning, such as [[lead poisoning|lead]], [[mercury poisoning|mercury]], or [[antimony]] poisoning.

In dogs and cats, thiabendazole is used to treat ear infections.

Thiabendazole is also used as a [[food additive]],<ref name="pmid853540">{{cite journal|last1=Rosenblum|first1=C|title=Non-Drug-Related Residues in Tracer Studies|journal=Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health|date=March 1977|volume=2|issue=4|pages=803–14|doi=10.1080/15287397709529480|pmid=853540|accessdate=2 October 2016}}</ref><ref>Sax, N.I.

== Safety ==
The substance appears to have a slight toxicity in higher doses, with effects such as liver and intestinal disorders at high exposure in test animals (just below {{LD50}} level).{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Some reproductive disorders and decreasing weaning weight have been observed, also at high exposure. Effects on humans from use as a drug include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness, or headache; very rarely also ringing in the ears, vision changes, stomach pain, yellowing eyes and skin, dark urine, fever, fatigue, increased thirst and change in the amount of urine occur.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Carcinogenic effects have been shown at higher doses.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reregistration Eligibility Decision THIABENDAZOLE|url=http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/REDs/thiabendazole_red.pdf|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=8 January 2013}}</ref>

Intermediate aryl[[amidine]] '''2''' is prepared by the [[AlCl3]] catalyzed addition of aniline to the nitrile function of 4-cyanothiazole ('''1'''). [[Amidine]] ('''2''') is then converted to its ''N''-chloro analog '''3''' by means of [[NaOCl]]. On base treatment, this apparently undergoes a [[nitrene]] insertion reaction ('''4''') to produce thiabendazole ('''5'''). Note the direction of the arrow is from the benzene to the nitrene since the nitrene is an electrophilic species.

[[Cambendazole]] (best of 300 agents in an extensive study),<ref>Chronicles of Drug Discovery, Book 1, pp 239-256.</ref> is made by nitration of tiabendazole, followed by [[catalytic hydrogenation]] to '''2''', and acylation with [[Isopropyl chloroformate]].

Additionally, tiabendazole was noted to exhibit moderate anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities, which led to the development of [[KB-1043]].
