==History==
Veterinarians Pierre-Richard Dick and Max Rombi founded Virbac (acronym of [[Virology|'''''vir'''''ology]] and [[Bacteriology|'''''bac'''''teriology]]) in 1968 as a veterinary office in the Cap 3000 mall in [[Nice]]. The office was sold two years later, after which Dick and Rombi focussed on [[animal drug]]s for pets, distinguishing Virbac from large veterinary pharmaceutical companies that specialised in livestock.<ref name=Bloch2010/>

At the end of the 1970s, Rombi began the subsidiary Arkovet, from where he developed Arkopharma, specialising in [[phytotherapy|phyto-]] and [[Medical nutrition therapy|nutrition therapy]].<ref name=Bloch2010/>

===International growth===
Virbac went international in 1983 with the establishment of offices in [[Egypt]] and [[Spain]]. Subsidiaries followed in the [[United States of America]] (1984), [[Italy]], [[Brazil]], [[Australia]], [[Germany]] (1987), [[Mexico]] (1988), [[Poland]], [[Japan]] (1992), and [[Belgium]] (1994).<ref name=Bloch2010/>

After Pierre-Richard Dick died in a car accident in 1992, his family decided to keep the company.<ref name=Bloch2010/>
