'''Human serum albumin''' is the [[serum albumin]] found in human [[blood]]. It is the most abundant [[protein]] in human [[blood plasma]]; it constitutes about half of [[serum (blood)|serum]] protein. It is produced in the [[liver]]. It is soluble and [[monomer]]ic.

Albumin transports hormones, fatty acids, and other compounds, buffers pH, and maintains [[oncotic pressure]], among other functions.

Albumin is synthesized in the liver as preproalbumin, which has an N-terminal peptide that is removed before the nascent protein is released from the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The product, proalbumin, is in turn cleaved in the Golgi vesicles to produce the secreted albumin.

The [[reference range]] for albumin concentrations in serum is approximately 35 - 50 g/L (3.5 - 5.0 g/dL).<ref name="Pathology Harmony">{{cite web|title=Harmonisation of Reference Intervals|url=http://www.acb.org.uk/docs/Pathology%20Harmony%20for%20web.pdf|work=pathologyharmony.co.uk|publisher=Pathology Harmony|accessdate=23 June 2013}}</ref>  It has a serum half-life of approximately 20 days. It has a [[molecular mass]] of 66.5 kDa.

The gene for albumin is located on chromosome 4 and mutations in this gene can result in anomalous proteins. The human albumin gene is 16,961 [[nucleotides]] long from the putative 'cap' site to the first poly(A) addition site. It is split into 15 exons that are symmetrically placed within the 3 domains thought to have arisen by triplication of a single primordial domain.

== Function ==
* Maintains [[oncotic pressure]]
* Transports [[thyroid hormone]]s
* Transports other hormones, in particular, ones that are fat-soluble
* Transports [[fatty acids]] ("free" fatty acids) to the liver and to myocytes for utilization of energy
* Transports unconjugated [[bilirubin]]
* Transports many [[medication|drugs]]; serum albumin levels can affect the half-life of drugs
* Competitively binds [[calcium]] ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)
* Serum albumin, as a negative acute-phase protein, is down-regulated in inflammatory states. As such, it is not a valid marker of nutritional status; rather, it is a marker of an inflammatory state
* Prevents photodegradation of [[folic acid]]

==Measurement==
Serum albumin is commonly measured by recording the change in [[absorbance]] upon binding to a dye such as [[bromocresol green]] or [[bromocresol purple]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Albumin: analyte monograph |url=http://www.acb.org.uk/docs/NHLM/Albumin.pdf |publisher=Association for Clinical Biochemistry and Laboratory Medicine |accessdate=23 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113144057/http://www.acb.org.uk/docs/NHLM/Albumin.pdf |archivedate=13 November 2012 |df= }}</ref>

===Hypoalbuminemia===
[[Hypoalbuminemia]] is a low blood albumin levels.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Douglas M.|title=Dorland's illustrated medical dictionary|date=2000|publisher=Saunders|location=Philadelphia [u.a.]|isbn=0721682618|page=860|edition=29.}}</ref> This can be caused by:

* Liver disease; [[cirrhosis]] of the liver is most common
* Excess excretion by the [[kidneys]] (as in [[nephrotic syndrome]])
* Excess loss in bowel (protein-losing enteropathy, e.g., [[Ménétrier's disease]])
* Burns (plasma loss in the absence of skin barrier)
* Redistribution (hemodilution [as in pregnancy], increased vascular permeability or decreased lymphatic clearance)
* Acute disease states (referred to as a negative [[acute-phase protein]])

===Hyperalbuminemia===
Hyperalbuminemia is an increased concentration of albumin in the blood.<ref name=Walker1990/> Typically, this condition is due to abrupt dehydration.<ref name=Walker1990>{{cite book|last1=Walker|first1=edited by H.

Chronic dehydration needs to be treated with zinc as well as with water {{Citation needed|reason=zinc toxicity can develop rapidly in dehydration|date=April 2017}}. Zinc reduces cell swelling caused by decreased intake of water (hypotonicity) and also increases retention of salt. In the dehydrated state, the body has too high an osmolarity and, it appears, discards zinc to prevent this. Zinc also regulates transport of the cellular osmolyte [[taurine]], and albumin is known to increase cellular [[taurine]] absorption. Zinc has been shown to increase retinol (vitamin A) production from beta-carotene, and in lab experiments retinol reduced human albumin production.<ref name="pmid16608438">{{cite journal | vauthors = Masaki T, Matsuura T, Ohkawa K, Miyamura T, Okazaki I, Watanabe T, Suzuki T | title = All-trans retinoic acid down-regulates human albumin gene expression through the induction of C/EBPβ-LIP | journal = Biochem.

===Therapeutic uses===

Human albumin solution or HSA is available for medical use, usually at concentrations of 5-25%.

Human albumin is often used to replace lost fluid and help restore blood volume in trauma, burns and surgery patients. A [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane]] [[systematic review]]<ref>The Albumin Reviewers (Alderson P, Bunn F, Li Wan Po A, Li L, Pearson M, Roberts I, Schierhout G). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001208.pub2/abstract Human albumin solution for resuscitation and volume expansion in critically ill patients]" ''Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews'' 2004, Issue 4. Art. No.: CD001208. {{doi|10.1002/14651858.CD001208.pub2}}.</ref> of 37 trials found no evidence that albumin, compared with cheaper alternatives such as saline, reduces the risk of dying.

Human serum albumin has been used as a component of a [[Frailty syndrome|frailty]] index.<ref name="pmid22995885" />

It has not been shown to give better results than other fluids when used simply to replace volume, but is frequently used in conditions where loss of albumin is a major problem, such as liver disease with ascites.

Moreover, the glycation can result in the formation of Advanced Glycation End-Products (AGE), which result in abnormal biological effects. Accumulation of AGEs leads to tissue damage via alteration of the structures and functions of tissue proteins, stimulation of cellular responses, through receptors specific for AGE-proteins, and generation of reactive oxygen intermediates. AGEs also react with DNA, thus causing mutations and DNA transposition. Thermal processing of proteins and carbohydrates brings major changes in allergenicity. AGEs are antigenic and represent many of the important neoantigens found in cooked or stored foods.<ref name="pmid11916310">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kańska U, Boratyński J | title = Thermal glycation of proteins by D-glucose and D-fructose | journal = Arch.

==Oxidation==
The albumin is the predominant protein in most body fluids, its Cys34 represents the largest fraction of free thiols within body. The albumin Cys34 thiol exists in both reduced and oxidized forms.<ref>Kawakami A, Kubota K, Yamada N, Tagami U, Takehana T, Sonaka I, Suzuki I, Hirayama K (2006). Identification and characterization of oxidized human serum albumin. FEBS J,  273:3346–3357. Doi: 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2006.05341.x</ref> In plasma of healthy young adults, 70%-80% of total HSA contains the free sulfhydryl group of Cys34 in a reduced form or mercaptoalbumin (HSA-SH).<ref>Turell L, Carballal L, Botti H, Radi R, Alvarez B. (2009). Oxidation of the albumin thiol to sulfenic acid and its implications in the intravascular compartment. Braz J Med Biol Res 42:305-311.</ref> However, in pathological states characterized by oxidative stress and during the aging process, the oxidized form, or non-mercaptoalbumin (HNA), could predominate <ref>Rosas-Díaz M, Camarillo-Cadena M, Hernández-Arana A, Ramón-Gallegos E, Medina-Navarro R. (2015). Antioxidant capacity and structural changes of human serum albumin from patients in advanced stages of diabetic nephropathy and the effect of the dialysis.

. The albumin thiol reacts with radical hydroxyl (.OH), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the reactive nitrogen species as peroxynitrite (ONOO.), and have been shown to oxidize Cys34 to sulfenic acid derivate (HSA-SOH), it can be recycled to mercapto-albumin; however at high concentrations of reactive species leads to the irreversible oxidation to sulfinic (HSA-SO2H)  or sulfonic acid (HSA-S3OH) affecting its structure.<ref>Matsuyama Y, Terawaki H, Terada T, Era S. (2011). Albumin thiol oxidation and serum protein carbonyl formation are progressively enhanced with advancing stages of chronic kidney disease. Clin Exp Nephrol, 13(4):308-315.</ref>  Presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS), can induce irreversible structural damage and alter protein activities.

== Loss via kidneys ==
In the healthy [[kidney]], albumin's size and negative electric charge exclude it from excretion in the [[glomerulus]]. This is not always the case, as in some [[kidney diseases|diseases]] including [[diabetic nephropathy]], which can sometimes be a complication of uncontrolled or of longer term [[diabetes]]  in which proteins can cross the glomerulus. The lost albumin can be detected by a simple urine test.<ref>[http://www.webmd.com/hw/diabetes_1_2/tu6440.asp Microalbumin Urine Test<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Depending on the amount of albumin lost, a patient may have normal renal function, [[microalbuminuria]], or [[albuminuria]].
