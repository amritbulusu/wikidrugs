'''Pentobarbital''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[Australian Approved Name|AAN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]], [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]) or '''pentobarbitone''' (former AAN and BAN) is a short-acting [[barbiturate]]. Pentobarbital can occur as both a free acid and as [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] of elements such as [[sodium]] and calcium. The free acid is only slightly soluble in water and [[ethanol]].<ref name=pubchem>

One brand name for this drug is '''Nembutal''', coined by John S. Lundy, who started using it in 1930, from the structural formula of the sodium salt&mdash;'''N'''a (sodium) + [[ethyl group|'''e'''thyl]] + [[methyl|'''m'''ethyl]] + [[butyl|'''but'''yl]] + '''[[-al#Usage notes|al]]''' (common [[suffix]] for [[barbiturate]]s).<ref name=Nembutal>{{cite journal | author = Fosburgh LC | title = From this point in time: Some memories of my part in the history of anesthesia--John S. Lundy, MD | journal = AANA Journal | volume = 65 | issue = 4 | pages = 323–328 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9281913 }}</ref> Nembutal is trademarked and manufactured by the Danish pharmaceutical company [[Lundbeck]], (now produced by Akorn pharmaceuticals) and is the only injectable form of pentobarbital approved for sale in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|date=1 Jul 2011|first=David|last=Jolly|title=Danish Company Blocks Sale of Drug for U.S. Executions|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/02/world/europe/02execute.html?_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=20 Nov 2013}}</ref>

In high doses, pentobarbital causes death by respiratory arrest. In the [[United States]], the drug has been used for [[executions]] of convicted criminals. Lundbeck (one of many manufacturers) does not permit its sale to prisons or corrections departments to carry out the death penalty.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/28/us-usa-executions-ohio-idUSBRE99R0SK20131028/ | title = Ohio says it will switch to new drugs for executions | publisher = Reuters | date = Oct 28, 2013}}</ref>

==Uses==

===Medical===
Typical applications for pentobarbital are sedative, hypnotic for short term, preanesthetic and control of convulsions in emergencies.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=f302ddf5-0213-43b3-b6c1-b3edf2bafbcd | title = NEMBUTAL SODIUM (pentobarbital sodium) injection, solution | publisher = DailyMed, [[National Institutes of Health]]}}</ref>

It is also used as a veterinary anesthetic agent.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.drugs.com/international/pentobarbital.html | title = International | publisher = Drugs.com}}</ref>

Pentobarbital also has an application in reducing intracranial pressure in [[Reye's syndrome]], traumatic brain injury and induction of coma in [[cerebral ischemia]] patients.<ref name=monograph>

===Euthanasia ===
Pentobarbital can induce death when used in high doses. It is used for [[euthanasia]] for humans as well as animals. It is also used by itself, or in combination with complementary agents such as [[phenytoin]], in commercial [[animal euthanasia]] injectable solutions.

In the [[Netherlands]], the standard protocol for physician-assisted suicide is intravenously induced [[thiopental]] anesthesia, followed by [[bromide]] of [[alcuronium]]- or [[pancuronium]]-induced respiratory arrest. A concentrated oral solution of 100 mL containing 9 grams of pentobarbital sodium along with sugar syrup in a 20% ethanol solution is a standard solution used for self-administration by patient.<ref name=netherlands>

The oral dosage of pentobarbital indicated for physician-assisted death in the United States states of Oregon, Washington, Vermont, and California (as of January, 2016) is typically 10 g in liquid form.<ref>{{Cite journal | title = Physician-assisted Suicide: Ongoing Challenges for Pharmacists |author1=Jennifer Fass |author2=Andrea Fass | journal = Am J Health Syst Pharm | year = 2011 | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 846–849 | url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/742070_3 | doi=10.2146/ajhp100333|pmid=21515870 }}</ref><ref name="pph">{{cite book |title=The Peaceful Pill Handbook |pages=137 |author1=Philip Nitschke |author2=Fiona Stewart |isbn=0978878809 |year=2006 |publisher=Exit International US Ltd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bNp3cyJImJwC&pg=PA137#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> This is considerably higher than the dose for the management of [[status epilepticus]].<ref name="lexicomp">Lexi-Comp Inc.

=== Execution ===
Pentobarbital has been used or considered as a substitute for other drugs traditionally used for [[capital punishment]] in the United States when they are in short supply.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/21/politics/states-lethal-injection-drugs | title = States urge feds to help import lethal injection drugs | publisher = CNN | date = May 21, 2012}}</ref> Such use however is illegal under Danish law, and when this was discovered, after public outcry in Danish media, Lundbeck, the owner of the drug, stopped selling it to US states that impose the [[death penalty]]. US distributors of the drug are forbidden by the owner to sell it to any customers, such as several state authorities, that practice or participate in executions of humans.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://nation.time.com/2013/08/07/the-hidden-hand-squeezing-texas-supply-of-execution-drugs/ | work=Time | date=7 August 2013 | title=The Hidden Hand Squeezing Texas' Supply of Execution Drugs}}</ref>

[[Texas]] began using pentobarbital for executing death-row inmates by [[lethal injection]] on July 18, 2012.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-18897310 |title=Texas executes Yokamon Hearn with pentobarbitol | date = 18 July 2012 | publisher = BBC News }}</ref> The use of pentobarbital has been considered by several states, including [[Ohio]], [[Arizona]], [[Idaho]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]]; those states made the decision to switch following shortages of [[pancuronium bromide]], a muscle relaxant previously used as one component in a three-drug cocktail.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://deathpenaltynews.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/texas-executes-yokamon-hearn.html |title=Texas executes Yokamon Hearn |deadurl=no |accessdate=20 July 2012}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=May 2013}}{{Dubious|date=January 2014}}

In October 2013, [[Missouri]] changed its protocols to allow for a compounded pentobarbital to be used in a lethal dose for executions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-24935868|title=Lethal injection: Secretive US states resort to untested drugs - BBC News|website=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-03-17}}</ref> On November 20, 2013, [[Joseph Paul Franklin]] was executed by the state of Missouri.<ref>https://news.yahoo.com/missouri-executes-serial-killer-franklin-122636393.html{{full|date=February 2017}}</ref> He was the first inmate executed in three years in the state and the first to die by a single dose of pentobarbital.<ref>http://www.christianpost.com/news/joseph-paul-franklin-executed-first-mo-inmate-killed-using-pentobarbital-109150/{{full|date=February 2017}}</ref>

==Metabolism==
Pentobarbital undergoes [[First pass effect|first-pass metabolism]] in the liver and possibly the intestines.<ref name=first-pass>

==Drug interactions==
Administration of [[ethanol]], [[benzodiazepine]]s, [[opioid]]s, [[antihistamine]]s, other [[sedative|sedative-hypnotic]]s, and other [[depressant|central nervous system depressants]] will cause possible additive effects.<ref name=monograph/>

==Chemistry==
Pentobarbital is synthesized by methods analogous to that of [[amobarbital]], the only difference being that the alkylation of α-ethylmalonic ester is carried out with 2-bromopentane (not 1-bromo-3-methylbutane) to give pentobarbital.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Volwiler | first1 = E.
