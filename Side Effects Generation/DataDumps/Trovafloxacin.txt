'''Trovafloxacin''' (sold as '''Trovan''' by [[Pfizer]] and '''Turvel''' by [[Laboratorios Almirall]]) was a broad spectrum [[antibiotic]] that inhibits the uncoiling of [[supercoiling|supercoiled]] [[DNA]] in various [[bacteria]] by blocking the activity of [[DNA gyrase]] and [[topoisomerase]] IV.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gootz|first=TD|author2=Zaniewski R |author3=Haskell S |author4=Schmieder B |author5=Tankovic J |author6=Girard D |author7=Courvalin P |author8=Polzer RJ |date=December 2006|title=Activity of the new fluoroquinolone trovafloxacin (CP-99,219) against DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV mutants of Streptococcus pneumoniae selected in vitro|journal=Antimicrob Agents Chemother|volume=40|issue=12|pages=2691–7|pmid=9124824|pmc=163605}}</ref> It was withdrawn from the market due to the risk of [[hepatotoxicity]]. It had better [[Gram-positive]] bacterial coverage and less [[Gram-negative]] coverage than the previous [[fluoroquinolones]].

==Adverse reactions==
Trovafloxacin use is significantly restricted due to its high potential for inducing serious, sometimes fatal liver damage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/wrul0hq68v6x8m57/ |title=Acute liver failure due to trovafloxacin: CT findings |doi=10.1007/PL00011876 }}</ref>

==Controversy==

===Nigerian clinical trial===
{{main|Kano Trovafloxacin trial litigation}}
In 1996, during a [[meningitis]] [[epidemic]] in [[Kano]], [[Nigeria]], the drug was administered to approximately 200<ref>{{citation | publisher = Federal Ministry of Health, Nigeria | title = Report of the Investigation Committee on the Clinical Trial of Trovafloxacin (Trovan) by Pfizer, Kano, 1996. | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/documents/Clinical_Trial_Report.pdf}}</ref> infected children. Eleven children died in the trial: five after taking Trovan and six after taking an older antibiotic used for comparison in the clinical trial. Others suffered blindness, deafness and brain damage, common consequences of meningitis that have not been seen in patients treated with trovafloxacin for other infection types.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Williams D, Hopkins S |title=Safety of trovafloxacin in treatment of lower respiratory tract infections |journal=Eur.

The most serious error was the falsification and backdating of an ethics approval letter by the lead investigator of the trial, Dr. Abdulhamid Isa Dutse. Dr. Dutse is now the chief medical officer of Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital. The result of the trial was that children treated with oral trovafloxacin had a 5% (5/100) mortality rate compared to a 6% (6/100) mortality rate with intramuscular ceftriaxone.

Between 2002 and 2005 the victims of the Trovan tests in Nigeria filed a [[Kano Trovafloxacin trial litigation|series of unsuccessful lawsuits]] in the United States.  However, in January 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit [[Ius cogens#Ethics|ruled]] that the Nigerian victims and their families were entitled to bring suit against [[Pfizer]] in the United States under the [[Alien Tort Statute]]. A US$75 million settlement with the State of Kano was reached on July 30, 2009.<ref name="washingtonpost">{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/30/AR2009073001847.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Pfizer to Pay $75 Million to Settle Nigerian Trovan Drug-Testing Suit | first=Joe | last=Stephens | date=July 31, 2009 | accessdate=May 26, 2010}}</ref> 
Additionally two lawsuits also remain pending in New York, United States.<ref name="washingtonpost" /> According to Wikileaked US embassy cables, Pfizer's country manager admitted that "Pfizer had hired investigators to uncover corruption links to federal attorney general Michael Aondoakaa to expose him and put pressure on him to drop the federal cases."<ref>{{cite news | last = Boseley | first = Sarah | date = 9 December 2010 | title = WikiLeaks cables: Pfizer 'used dirty tricks to avoid clinical trial payout' | work =  The Guardian | url = https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/dec/09/wikileaks-cables-pfizer-nigeria}}</ref>

===Post-approval link to hepatotoxicity===
Trovan sales during its first full year on the market contributed US$160 million of Pfizer's total revenue of US$12.6 billion. Investors expected it to eventually bring in US$1 billion per year.<ref name = NYT3>{{cite news |last = Petersen |first = Melody  |title = Unforeseen Side Effects Ruined One Blockbuster |work =[[The New York Times]] |page = 3.11 |date = August 27, 2000 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/27/business/unforeseen-side-effects-ruined-one-blockbuster.html}}</ref>

In June 1999 the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] advised doctors to limit the prescription of Trovan after it had been found "strongly associated" with 14 cases of acute liver failure and six deaths. The FDA had received over 100 reports of liver problems in people taking Trovan, which was at that time being prescribed at a rate of 300,000 patients per month in the United States. Two days later the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products recommended to the [[European Commission]] that marketing approval of Trovan be suspended for a year.<ref name="NYT3" /><ref name = NYT2>{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/12/business/company-news-suspension-of-trovan-drug-in-europe-is-urged.html | title = Suspension of Trovan Drug in Europe Is Urged |work =[[The New York Times]] |page = C.3 |date = June 12, 1999}}</ref>

==Synthesis==
[[File:Trovafloxacin synthesis.svg|thumb|center|700px|Trovafloxacin synthesis: K. E. Brighty, {{US patent|5164402}} (1992 to Pfizer).]]
The key reaction in building the ring consists of [[1,3-Dipolar cycloaddition]] of [[ethyl diazoacetate]] to N-Cbz-[[3-pyrroline]] to afford the [[pyrrazolidine]] ('''3'''). [[Pyrolysis]] results in loss of nitrogen and formation of the cyclopropylpyrrolidine ring. The stereochemistry of the ring simply reflects the thermodynamics, since ''cis'' ring fusion is by far the most stable arrangement, as is the ''cis'' configuration of the ester group. The ester is then saponified to the corresponding carboxylic acid ('''5'''). The acid undergoes a version of the [[Curtius rearrangement]] when treated with [[diphenylphosphoryl azide]] (DPPA) to afford the transient isocyanate ('''6'''). The reactive function adds [[t-BuOH]] from the reaction medium to afford the product as its [[tert-Butyloxycarbonyl protecting group]] derivative ('''7'''). [[Catalytic hydrogenation]] then removes the [[carbobenzyloxy]] [[protecting group]] to afford the secondary amine ('''8'''). In a standard [[quinoline]] reaction, this amine is then used to displace the more reactive fluorine at the 7-position in Ethyl 1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-6,7-difluoro-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylate ('''9''').<ref>D.
