'''Secobarbital sodium''' (marketed by [[Eli Lilly and Company]], and subsequently by other companies as described below, under the brand name '''Seconal''') is a [[barbiturate]] derivative drug that was patented in 1934 in the United States.<ref>{{cite patent | country = US | status = patent | number = 1954429 | gdate = 1934-04-10 | title = Propyl-Methyl Carbinyl Allyl Barbituric Acid and its Salts | inventor = Shonle, H. A. | assign1 = Eli Lilly }}</ref> It possesses [[anaesthetic]], [[anticonvulsant]], [[anxiolytic]], [[sedative]], and [[hypnotic]] properties. In the United Kingdom, it was known as '''quinalbarbitone'''. It is the most frequently used drug in [[Assisted suicide|physician-assisted suicide]] within the United States.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/03/23/471595323/drug-company-jacks-up-cost-of-aid-in-dying-medication|title=Drug Company Jacks Up Cost Of Aid-In-Dying Medication|last=Dembosky|first=April|website=NPR.org|access-date=2016-03-24}}</ref>

==Indications==

Secobarbital is indicated for:
*Treatment of [[epilepsy]]
*Temporary treatment of [[insomnia]]
*Use as a preoperative medication to produce [[anaesthesia]] and [[anxiolysis]] in short surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures which are minimally painful.

==Availability==

[[File:Secobarbital DOJ.jpg|left|frame]]

[[Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals]], an India-based company now predominantly owned by the Japanese company [[Daiichi Sankyo]], obtained the rights to market and to use the trade name “Seconal” from Eli Lilly in 1998 and did so until September 18, 2008. The actual manufacturer of Seconal subsequent to the time Eli Lilly manufactured the drug was Ohm Pharmaceuticals, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ranbaxy. The rights to market Seconal were then sold to Marathon Pharmaceuticals,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marathonpharma.com/products/seconal-sodium |title=» Seconal Sodium® |publisher=Marathonpharma.com |date=2013-07-31 |accessdate=2014-03-05}}</ref> which became the marketer and trade-name holder. In February 2015, Marathon sold the rights to [[Valeant Pharmaceuticals]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://marathonpharma.com/news/2015/02/marathon-pharmaceuticals-llc-divests-non-strategic-products-focus-exclusively-rare-disease-treatments/|title=Marathon Pharma to Focusing Exclusively on Rare Disease|website=Marathon Pharmaceuticals, LLC|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-24}}</ref> However Seconal is still manufactured by Ohm.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/pro/seconal-sodium.html|title=Seconal Sodium - FDA prescribing information, side effects and uses|website=www.drugs.com|access-date=2016-03-24}}</ref> In the United States, Seconal is available only in 100&nbsp;mg capsules, as a [[sodium salt]]. The salt is a white [[hygroscopic]] powder that is soluble in water and ethanol.

After the rights to Seconal were sold to Valeant Pharmaceuticals in 2015, Valeant immediately doubled the price in the United States from $1,500 per 100 capsules to $3,000. While [[Generic drug|generic]] versions of the drug used to exist after the Seconal patent expired in the early 1990s, there are currently no generics available on the U.S. market, making Valeant the sole vendor of the drug there.<ref name=":0" />

*Molecular weight: 260.265

==Side effects==

==Withdrawal==

Secobarbital may produce psychological addiction and produces physical dependence if used for an extended period of time. [[Drug withdrawal|Withdrawal]] symptoms may occur if long-term use is abruptly ended and can include:

*Anxiety
*Insomnia
*Lack of appetite
*Seizures
*Tremors
*Possible death as a result of withdrawal

==Recreational use==

Secobarbital was widely misused in the 1960s and 1970s, and accidental overdose was associated with the drug. It was linked with the death of [[Judy Garland#Death|Judy Garland]], where the postmortem found that her blood contained the equivalent of ten 1.5-grain (97&nbsp;mg) Seconal capsules. Additionally the drug played a key role in the suicide of [[Charles Boyer]] in 1978. Consequently, the prescription of Seconal decreased greatly, beginning in the early 1980s by which time [[benzodiazepines]] had become increasingly common. Secobarbital has acquired many nicknames, the most common being “reds,” “red devils,” or “red dillies” (because of the color of the capsules). Other common nicknames are “seccies,” “Cardinals,” “ruby slippers,” and, according to the Wegman’s School of Pharmacy curriculum, “red hearts.” A less common nickname is “dolls”; this was partly responsible for the title of [[Jacqueline Susann]]’s novel ''[[Valley of the Dolls]]'', whose main characters use secobarbital and other such drugs.

Another celebrity death attributed to secobarbital was that of [[Anissa Jones]] (a child star who played Buffy on ''[[Family Affair]]'') on August 28, 1976. It was detected in her system, along with [[cocaine]], [[Phencyclidine|PCP]], and [[methaqualone]], but it was the only pharmaceutical in her toxicology report that led to homicide charges against a vendor, that being Dr. Don Carlos Moshos, who dispensed it without a proper cause or examination (as well as for Jones’s recreational use), according to a postmortem criminal investigation.

Actress [[Lupe Velez]]’s death was also reportedly caused by an overdose of the drug.

Secobarbital was implicated in the death of [[Dinah Washington]]. Early on the morning of December 14, 1963, Washington’s seventh husband, football great [[Dick Lane (American football)|Dick “Night Train” Lane]], went to sleep with his wife and awoke later to find her slumped over and not responsive. Doctor B.C. Ross came to the scene and pronounced her dead. An autopsy later showed a lethal combination of secobarbital and [[amobarbital]], which contributed to her death at the age of 39. She is buried in the Burr Oak Cemetery in Alsip, Illinois.

==Use in animal and human euthanasia==
In the [[Netherlands]], individuals have two options for [[euthanasia]]. They can orally consume 100 ml of concentrated syrup containing either 15 grams of [[pentobarbital]] or 15 grams of secobarbital, or they can choose to have 2 grams of [[thiopental]] or 1 gram of [[propofol]] administered intravenously by a doctor, followed by a muscle relaxant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oncoline.nl/index.php?pagina=/richtlijn/item/pagina.php&id=32169&richtlijn_id=754|title=Hulp bij zelfdoding(Dutch)|author=unknown|work=Oncoline|date=July 29, 2010|display-authors=etal}}</ref> In recent years only 15% of those who died by euthanasia opted for orally consuming the lethal drug(s), the rest choosing to have the drugs administered intravenously by a doctor instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medischcontact.nl/archief-6/Tijdschriftartikel/75650/Euthanasiedrank-verliest-terrein.htm|title=Euthanasiedrank verliest terrein(Dutch)|author=Heleen Croonen|work=Medisch contact|date=April 1, 2010|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

In the United States, secobarbital and pentobarbital are the most common drugs prescribed under physician aid-in-dying laws in Oregon since 1998, Washington since 2008, Vermont since 2013, and New Mexico since 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1213398|title=Implementing a Death with Dignity Program at a Comprehensive Cancer Center|author=Elizabeth Trice Loggers, M.D., Ph.D|work=New England Journal of Medicine|date=April 11, 2013|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://public.health.oregon.gov/ProviderPartnerResources/EvaluationResearch/DeathwithDignityAct/Documents/year16.pdf|title=Oregon’s Death with Dignity Act 2013 Report|publisher=Oregon Health Authority|date=January 28, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200303063481022|title=Five Years of Legal Physician-Assisted Suicide in Oregon|author=Katrina Hedberg, M.D., M.P.H.|date=March 6, 2003|work=New England Journal of Medicine|display-authors=etal}}</ref> [[Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited]] previously experienced various issues in their attempts to produce 100&nbsp;mg secobarbital capsules. 

It is a component in the [[veterinary]] drug '''Somulose''', used for [[animal euthanasia|euthanasia]] of [[horse]]s and [[cattle]].

The [[LD50]] of secobarbital has been reported to be between 125 mg/kg(rat, oral) and 267 mg/kg(mouse, oral).<ref name=NIH>{{cite web | author = NIH | title = Secobarbital - Human Health Effects | url = https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+3182}}</ref>
