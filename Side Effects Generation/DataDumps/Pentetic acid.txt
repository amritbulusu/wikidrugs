'''Pentetic acid''' or '''diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid''' ('''DTPA''') is an [[aminopolycarboxylic acid]] consisting of a [[diethylenetriamine]] backbone with five carboxymethyl groups. The molecule can be viewed as an expanded version of [[Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid|EDTA]] and is used similarly.  It is a white, water-soluble solid.

==Coordination properties==
The [[Conjugate acid|conjugate base]] of DTPA has a high affinity for metal cations. Thus, the penta-anion DTPA<sup>5−</sup> is potentially an [[denticity|octadentate ligand]] assuming that each nitrogen centre and each COO<sup>−</sup>-group counts as a centre for coordination. The [[Stability constants of complexes|formation constants]] for its complexes are about 100 greater than those for EDTA.<ref name=Ullmann>J. Roger Hart "Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid and Related Chelating Agents" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005.{{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a10_095}}</ref>  As a [[Chelation|chelating agent]], DTPA wraps around a metal ion by forming up to eight bonds. Transition metals, however, usually form less than eight [[Dipolar bond|coordination bonds]]. So, after forming a complex with a metal, DTPA still has the ability to bind to other reagents, as is shown by its derivative [[pendetide]]. For example, in its complex with copper(II), DTPA binds in a hexadentate manner utilizing the three amine centres and three of the five carboxylates.<ref>V. V. Fomenko, T. N. Polynova, M. A. Porai-Koshits, G. L. Varlamova and N. I. Pechurova ''Crystal structure of copper (II) diethylenetriaminepentaacetate monohydrate'' Journal of Structural Chemistry, 1973, Vol. 14, 529. {{DOI|10.1007/BF00747020}}</ref>

==Applications==
Like the more common EDTA, DTPA is mainly used for [[sequestering agent|sequestering]] metal ions that otherwise decompose [[hydrogen peroxide]], which is used to [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleach pulp]] in paper making. Several million kilograms are produced for this purpose annually.<ref name=Ullmann/>

Its chelating properties are useful in deactivating calcium and magnesium ions in hair products. DTPA is used in over 150 cosmetic products.<ref>Burnett, L. C. "Final Report on the Safety Assessment of Pentasodium Pentetate and  Pentetic Acid as Used in Cosmetics" International Journal of Toxicology 2008, 27, 71-92.</ref> Additionally, DTPA is used in MRI contrasting agents. DTPA improves MRI images by forming a complex with a gadolinium ion, which alters the properties of nearby water molecules.<ref>Caravan, Peter; Ellison, Jeffrey J.; McMurry, Thomas J. ; Lauffer, Randall B. "Gadolinium(III) Chelates as MRI Contrast Agents:  Structure, Dynamics, and Applications" Chem. Revs. 1999, volume 99, pp. 2293–2342.</ref>

DTPA has been considered for treatment of radioactive materials such as [[plutonium]], [[americium]], and other [[actinide]]s. In theory, these complexes are more apt to be eliminated in urine. It is normally administered as the [[calcium]] or [[zinc]] salt, since these ions are readily displaced by more highly charged cations.  DTPA forms complexes with thorium(IV), uranium(IV), neptunium(IV), and cerium(III/IV).<ref>(2) Brown, M. A.; Paulenova, A.; Gelis, A. V. "Aqueous Complexation of Thorium(IV), Uranium(IV), Neptunium(IV), Plutonium(III/IV), and Cerium(III/IV) with DTPA" Inorganic Chemistry 2012, volume 51, 7741-7748. {{DOI|10.1021/ic300757k}}</ref>

In August, 2004 the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) determined zinc-DTPA and calcium-DTPA to be safe and effective for treatment of those who have breathed in or otherwise been contaminated internally by plutonium, americium, or curium.  The recommended treatment is for an initial dose of calcium-DTPA, as this salt of DTPA has been shown to be more effective in the first 24 hours after internal contamination by plutonium, americium, or curium.  After that time has elapsed both calcium-DTPA and zinc-DTPA are similarly effective in reducing internal contamination with plutonium, americium or curium, and zinc-DTPA is less likely to deplete the body's normal levels of zinc and other metals essential to health. Each drug can be administered by nebulizer for those who have breathed in contamination, and by intravenous injection for those contaminated by other routes.<ref name="USFDA">{{cite web | url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/EmergencyPreparedness/BioterrorismandDrugPreparedness/ucm130312.htm | title="FDA Approves Drugs to Treat Internal Contamination from Radioactive Elements" (press release) | publisher=United States Food and Drug Administration | origyear=4 August 2004| date=19 June 2015 | accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>

DTPA is also used as a chelate for aquarium plant fertilizer, specifically iron, an essential micronutrient typically needed in substantial quantities by all plants. Chelates are dissolved organic substances that bind to metals and prevent them from forming larger molecules through oxidation. FeDTPA is often sold under the name iron chelate 10% or 11% when used for the purpose of aquarium plant fertilization. Iron typically found in the aquarium water column has been converted into the ferric state (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) since it is in the presence of dissolved oxygen. However plants require iron in the ferrous state (Fe<sup>2+</sup>), therefore additional energy must be expended in order to extract the ferric iron from the water column and convert it to the ferrous form. When used to chelate iron fertilizer DTPA ensures that the iron is kept in the ferrous state (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) over time so it can be utilized by aquatic plants without expending valuable energy.
