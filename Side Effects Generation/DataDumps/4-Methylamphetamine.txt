'''4-Methylamphetamine''' ('''4-MA'''; '''PAL-313'''; '''Aptrol'''; '''p-TAP''') is a [[stimulant]] and [[anorectic]] [[drug]] of the [[phenethylamine]] and [[amphetamine]] [[chemical class]]es.

In vitro, it acts as a [[potency (pharmacology)|potent]] and [[functional selectivity|balanced]] [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[dopamine]] [[releasing agent]] with [[Dissociation constant|K<sub>i</sub>]] [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] values of 53.4nM, 22.2nM, and 44.1nM at the [[serotonin transporter|serotonin]], [[norepinephrine transporter|norepinephrine]], and [[dopamine transporter]]s, respectively.<ref name="pmid15677348">{{Cite journal

These studies showed that 4-methylamphetamine is much more potent at elevating serotonin (~18 x baseline) relative to dopamine (~5 x baseline). The authors speculated that this is because 5-HT release dampens DA release through some mechanism. For example, it was suggested that a possible cause for this could be activation of 5HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors since this is known to inhibit DA release. In addition there are alternative explanations such as 5-HT release then going on to encourage GABA release, which has an inhibitory effect on DA neurons.<ref>{{Cite journal

4-MA was investigated as an [[appetite suppressant]] in 1952 and was even given a trade name, '''Aptrol''', but development was apparently never completed.<ref name="pmid14890975">{{Cite journal

In animal studies, 4-MA was shown to have the lowest rate of self-administration out of a range of similar drugs tested (the others being [[3-methylamphetamine]], [[4-fluoroamphetamine]], and [[3-fluoroamphetamine]]), likely as a result of having the highest potency for releasing serotonin relative to dopamine.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wee | first1 = S | last2 = Anderson | first2 = KG | last3 = Baumann | first3 = MH | last4 = Rothman | first4 = RB | last5 = Blough | first5 = BE | last6 = Woolverton | first6 = WL | title = Relationship between the serotonergic activity and reinforcing effects of a series of amphetamine analogs. | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 313 | issue = 2 | pages = 848–54 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15677348 | doi = 10.1124/jpet.104.080101 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Baumann | first1 = MH | last2 = Clark | first2 = RD | last3 = Woolverton | first3 = WL | last4 = Wee | first4 = S | last5 = Blough | first5 = BE | last6 = Rothman | first6 = RB. |date=Apr 2011 | title = In vivo effects of amphetamine analogs reveal evidence for serotonergic inhibition of mesolimbic dopamine transmission in the rat | url = | journal = Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 337 | issue = 1| pages = 218–25 | doi = 10.1124/jpet.110.176271 | pmid = 21228061 | pmc=3063744}}</ref>

More than a dozen deaths have been reported throughout Europe in 2012-2013 after consumption of amphetamine ('speed') contaminated with 4-methylamphetamine.

Since 4-MA has little, if any, desirable psychoactive properties, researchers doubt the substance was sold as amphetamine on purpose. A contaminated precursor, after synthesis yielding a mixture of amphetamine and 4-MA, seems the logical culprit.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = 4-Methyl-amphetamine: a health threat for recreational amphetamine users|journal = Journal of Psychopharmacology |date = 2013-09-01|issn = 1461-7285|pmid = 23784740|pages = 817–822|volume = 27|issue = 9|doi = 10.1177/0269881113487950|first = P.|last = Blanckaert|first2 = Jgc|last2 = van Amsterdam|first3 = Tm|last3 = Brunt|first4 = Jdj|last4 = van den Berg|first5 = F.|last5 = Van Durme|first6 = K.|last6 = Maudens|first7 = Jch|last7 = van Bussel}}</ref>
