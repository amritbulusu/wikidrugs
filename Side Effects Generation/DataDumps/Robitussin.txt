'''Robitussin''' is a [[brand]] name and registered trademark for both [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] (OTC) and [[Prescription drug|prescription]] [[Cough medicine|cough and cold medicines]] manufactured by [[Pfizer]]. Robitussin products are available in many countries worldwide, though formulations and regulatory standards differ between countries. Robitussin is manufactured on Darbytown Road in Richmond, Virginia, at a site once owned by the drug's developer, AH Robins; its generic versions are manufactured by Qualitest.

==History==
Robitussin was originally produced by AH Robins of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Virginia]]. AH Robins was purchased by American Home Products (AHP) in the late 1980s. AHP subsequently merged with [[Wyeth]]. Wyeth placed manufacturing and marketing of the brand under its Whitehall-Robins Healthcare division.  Production was taken over by [[Pfizer]] when it acquired Wyeth in 2009.

During the 1970s and early 1980s, [[Marion Merrell Dow|Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals]] sold similar cough syrups (differing slightly in flavor, but pharmacologically identical) under the names "2/G" (a reference to "glyceryl guaiacolate," an older name for guaifenesin) for the base expectorant formulation and "2G/DM" for the guaifenesin/dextromethorphan formulation.

==Summary of active ingredients==
The brand name Robitussin is used for several formulations of cough and cold medicine that contain different active ingredients:

; [[Paracetamol|Acetaminophen]]
: Acetaminophen is an [[analgesic]] (pain reliever) and [[antipyretic]] (fever reducer) found in some formulations of Robitussin CF, as well as Daytime Cold + Flu capsules. 
; [[Codeine]] (phosphate)
: Codeine is a [[narcotic]] [[Cough medicine|antitussive]] found in Robitussin DAC and Robitussin AC. In the United States, cough formulations containing codeine are usually prescription-only, but the level of regulation can vary from state to state.
; [[Chlorphenamine|Chlorpheniramine]] (maleate)
: Chlorpheniramine is an [[antihistamine]] found in various children's cough and cold syrups.
; [[Dextromethorphan]] (hydrobromide)
: Dextromethorphan is a narcotic antitussive, with psychedelic effects found in most OTC Robitussin products. Its efficacy as an antitussive is considered weak.
; [[Diphenhydramine]] (hydrochloride)
: Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine found in some nighttime Robitussin formulations.
; [[Doxylamine]] (succinate) 
: Doxylamine is a [[Hypnotic|sleep aid]] found in some nighttime Robitussin formulations.
; [[Guaifenesin]]
: Guaifenesin is an [[expectorant]] found in most Robitussin products designed to relieve cough and chest congestion.
; [[Menthol]]
: Menthol is an oral anesthetic found in Robitussin DM lozenges.
; [[Phenylephrine]] (hydrochloride)
: Phenylephrine is a [[decongestant]] found in Robitussin CF and Daytime Cold + Flu.
; [[Promethazine]] (hydrochloride)
: Promethazine is an antihistamine found in older nighttime formulations of Robitussin. Like codeine, it is  prescription-only in the U.S.
; [[Pseudoephedrine]] (hydrochloride)
: Pseudoephedrine is a [[decongestant]] that has largely been replaced by phenylephrine in OTC formulations of Robitussin, though it may still be available in prescription syrups.

==Robitussin DAC/Robitussin AC==
Robitussin DAC is used to treat acute cough, mucus buildup and nasal congestion. Because this medicine contains codeine, it is usually only prescribed when a patient has a painful and persistent cough, and/or one that interferes with the patient's sleep cycle. Each 5 mL of Robitussin DAC contains 10 mg of codeine, 100 mg of guaifenesin, and 30 mg of pseudoephedrine. 

Robitussin AC is Robitussin DAC without the pseudoephedrine. The taste mimics cherries but is said to have an unpleasant after-taste. The version of Robitussin AC with promethazine is usually flavored peach-mint or grape/menthol. These syrups are purple instead of red. Robitussin AC has a 3.5% alcohol content, and the versions with promethazine have 7% alcohol.

Generic forms are available under the names Cheratussin DAC and Cheratussin AC.
