'''Etretinate''' (trade name '''Tegison''') is a [[medication]] developed by [[Hoffmann–La Roche]] that was approved by the FDA in 1986 to treat severe [[psoriasis]]. It is a second-generation [[retinoid]].<ref name="Mutschler">{{Cite book|last1=Mutschler|first1=Ernst|last2=Schäfer-Korting|first2=Monika|title=Arzneimittelwirkungen|language=German|location=Stuttgart|publisher=Wissenschaftliche Verlagsgesellschaft|year=2001|edition=8|page=728f|isbn=3-8047-1763-2}}</ref> It was subsequently removed from the [[Canada|Canadian]] market in 1996 and the [[United States]] market in 1998 due to the high risk of birth defects. It remains on the market in Japan as '''Tigason'''.

==Pharmacology==
Etretinate is a highly [[lipophilic]], [[aromatic]] retinoid. It is stored and released from [[adipose tissue]], so its effects can continue long after dosage stops. It is detectable in the plasma for up to three years following therapy. Etretinate has a low [[therapeutic index]] and a long [[elimination half-life]] (''t''<sub>1/2</sub>) of 120 days,<ref name="Mutschler" /> which make dosing difficult.

Etretinate has been replaced by [[acitretin]], the free acid (without the [[ethyl group|ethyl]] ester). While acitretin is less lipophilic and has a half-life of only 50 hours, it is partly metabolized to etretinate in the body,<ref name="Mutschler" /> so that it is still a long-acting [[teratogen]] and pregnancy is prohibited for two years after therapy.<ref name="Austria-Codex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Jasek, W|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2007|edition=62nd|isbn=978-3-85200-181-4|page=5669|language=German}}</ref>

==Precautions==
*Etretinate is a [[teratogen]], and may cause [[birth defect]]s long after use. Therefore, birth control is advised during therapy, and for at least three years after therapy has stopped.<ref name="MMX" />
*Etretinate should be avoided in [[children]], as it may interfere with [[bone growth]].<ref name="MMX" />
*If a patient has ever taken etretinate, he or she is not eligible to [[blood donation|donate blood]] in the United States or the United Kingdom, due to the risk of birth defects.<ref>[http://www.transfusionguidelines.org.uk/index.aspx?Publication=WB&Section=5&PageID=3630&AZLetter=E UK Blood Transfusion and Tissue Transplantation Services]</ref> In Japan, people may not donate blood for two years after ceasing to use the medication.<ref name=JapaneseDrugs/>

==Side effects==
Side effects are those typical of [[hypervitaminosis A]], most commonly<ref name="MMX" />
* bone or joint pain, stiffness; in long-term treatment [[diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis]]
* muscular or [[abdominal]] cramps
* dry, burning, itching eyelids
* unusual bruising

==History==
