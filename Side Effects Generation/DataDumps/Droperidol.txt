'''Droperidol''' {{IPA|/droʊˈpɛrIdɔːl/}} ('''Inapsine''', '''Droleptan''', '''Dridol''', '''Xomolix''', '''Innovar''' [combination with [[fentanyl]]]) is an [[antidopaminergic]] [[medication|drug]] used as an [[antiemetic]] (that is, to prevent or treat nausea) and as an [[antipsychotic]]. Droperidol is also often used as a sedative in [[intensive care medicine|intensive-care treatment]].

== History and use ==
Discovered at [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]] in 1961, droperidol is a [[butyrophenone]] which acts a potent [[dopamine antagonist|D<sub>2</sub> (dopamine receptor) antagonist]] with some [[histamine]] and [[serotonin]] antagonist activity.<ref name="Per">{{cite journal

}}</ref> It has also been used as an antipsychotic in doses ranging from 5 to 10&nbsp;mg given as an intramuscular injection, generally in cases of severe agitation in a psychotic patient who is refusing oral medication. Its use in intramuscular sedation has been replaced by intramuscular preparations of [[haloperidol]], [[midazolam]], [[clonazepam]] and [[olanzapine]]. Some practitioners recommend the use of 0.5&nbsp;mg to 1&nbsp;mg intravenously for the treatment of vertigo in an otherwise healthy elderly patients who have not responded to [[Epley maneuver]]s.

== Black box warning ==
In 2001, the FDA changed the labeling requirements for droperidol injection to include a Black Box Warning, citing concerns of [[QT prolongation]] and [[torsades de pointes]]. The evidence for this is disputed, with 9 reported cases of ''torsades'' in 30 years and all of those having received doses in excess of 5&nbsp;mg.<ref name="Kao">{{cite journal

==Chemistry==
Droperidol is synthesized from 1-benzyl-3-carbethoxypiperidin-4-one,
which is reacted with o-phenylendiamine. Evidently, the first derivative that is formed under the reaction conditions, 1,5-benzdiazepine, rearranges into 1-(1-benzyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-piridyl)-2-benzymidazolone. Debenzylation of the resulting product with hydrogen over a palladium catalyst, and subsequent alkylation of this using 4-chloro-4'-fluorobutyrophenone yields droperidol.
