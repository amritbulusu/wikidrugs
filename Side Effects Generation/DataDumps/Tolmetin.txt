'''Tolmetin''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɒ|l|m|ə|t|ᵻ|n}} is a [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] (NSAID) of the heterocyclic [[acetic acid]] derivative class. It is used primarily to reduce hormones that cause pain, swelling, tenderness, and stiffness in conditions such as [[osteoarthritis]] and [[rheumatoid arthritis]], including [[juvenile idiopathic arthritis|juvenile rheumatoid arthritis]]. In the [[United States]] it is marketed as '''Tolectin''' and comes as a tablet or capsule.

==Clinical trials==
Tolmetin is applicable in the treatment of [[rheumatoid arthritis]],<ref>{{Cite journal | title = Tolmetin sodium, a new anti-arthritis drug: double-blind and long-term studies | author = Cordrey L J  | journal =  Journal of the American Geriatrics Society  | year = 1976 | volume = 24 | issue = 10 | pages = 440–446 | pmid = 61224}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = A double-blind crossover comparison of tolmetin sodium and phenylbutazone in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis | author =     Cardoe N; Steele C E  | journal =  Current medical research and opinion  | year = 1976–1977 | volume = 4 | issue = 10 | pages = 688–694 | pmid = 800970 | doi=10.1185/03007997609112003}}</ref> [[osteoarthrosis]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Liyanage S P; Steele C E | title =  Tolmetin in osteoarthrosis of the hip and knee: double-blind crossover trials | journal = Current medical research and opinion  | year = 1977–1978 | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 299–305 | pmid = 343992 | doi = 10.1185/03007997709110184}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Davies | first1 = J | last2 = Dixon | first2 = AS | last3 = Steele | first3 = CE | title = Tolmetin sodium and indomethacin in the treatment of osteoarthrosis of the hip: a double-blind crossover study | journal = Current medical research and opinion | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 115–20 | year = 1980 | pmid = 7002480 | doi = 10.1185/03007998009112037}}</ref> pain,<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Stacher | first1 = G | last2 = Bauer | first2 = P | last3 = Ehn | first3 = I | last4 = Schreiber | first4 = E | title = Effects of tolmetin, paracetamol, and of two combinations of tolmetin and paracetamol as compared to placebo on experimentally induced pain.

==Mechanism of action==

Although the [[mechanism of action]] of tolmetin is unknown, research involving humans and animals has shown that tolmetin does not achieve anti-inflammatory response by stimulation of the [[adrenal gland|adrenal]] or [[pituitary gland]], but it has shown tolmetin restrains prostaglandin synthetase ''[[in vitro]]'' and reduces plasma levels of [[prostaglandin E]], possibly causing the anti-inflammatory response.

When tested in rats tolmetin prevented experimentally stimulated [[polyarthritis]] and reduced inflammation. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis or [[osteoarthritis]] tolmetin restrained disease activity as efficiently as [[aspirin]] and [[indometacin]], although the occurrence of mild gastrointestinal [[adverse effect]]s and [[tinnitus]] was lower in patients treated with tolmetin than it was with aspirin-treated patients and the occurrence of adverse effects of the [[central nervous system]] was lower with tolmetin than it was with indometacin.<ref name="DrugBank">{{cite web|title =Tolmetin|publisher = DrugBank|accessdate = 2007-07-02|url = http://redpoll.pharmacy.ualberta.ca/drugbank/cgi-bin/getCard.cgi?CARD=APRD01268}}</ref>

==Side effects==
Tolmetin can increase the risk of heart or circulatory conditions such as [[heart attack]]s and [[stroke]]s. It should not be taken shortly before or after [[coronary artery bypass surgery]].<ref name="MedlinePlus">{{cite web|title =Tolmetin|publisher = MedlinePlus|accessdate = 2007-07-02|url = http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a681033.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070610084635/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a681033.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-10}}</ref> Tolmetin can also increase the risk of gastrointestinal conditions such as perforation or bleeding, which is fatal. [[Antacid]]s can be taken with tolmetin to relieve [[abdominal pain|stomachache]]s that often occur.<ref name=MedlinePlus/> Overdose can result in drowsiness, [[nausea]], epigastric pain, and vomiting.
