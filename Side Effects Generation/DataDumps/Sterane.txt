'''Sterane''' ('''cyclopentanoperhydrophenanthrenes''' or '''cyclopentane perhydro phenanthrene''') compounds are a class of 4-[[cyclic compound]]s derived from [[steroids]] or [[sterols]] via [[diagenesis|diagenetic]] and [[catagenesis (geology)|catagenetic]] degradation and saturation. Steranes have an [[androstane]] skeleton with a side chain at carbon C-17. The sterane structure constitutes the core of all [[sterols]]. Steranes are sometimes used as [[biomarker]]s for the presence of [[eukaryotic cell]]s. <ref>[http://www-eaps.mit.edu/geobiology/biomarkers/steroids.html About biomarkers] geobiology@mit. Accessed 8 October 2009.</ref>

Steranes may be rearranged to diasteranes during [[diagenesis]] (C-27 to C-30, rearrangement at C-18 and C-19, no R at C-24). [[Oil]]s from [[Clastic rock|clastic source rocks]] tend to be rich in diasteranes.

[[Cholesterol]] and its derivatives (such as [[progesterone]], [[aldosterone]], [[cortisol]], and [[testosterone]]), are common examples of compounds with the cyclopentanoperhydrophenanthrene nucleus.
