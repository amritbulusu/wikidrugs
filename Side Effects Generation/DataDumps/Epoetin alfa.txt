== Medical uses ==

Erythropoietin is available as a therapeutic agent produced by [[recombinant DNA technology]] in mammalian [[cell culture]]. It is used in treating [[anemia]] resulting from [[chronic kidney disease]] and [[myelodysplasia]], from the treatment of [[cancer]] ([[chemotherapy]] and [[radiation]]).

=== Anemia caused by chronic kidney disease ===

For patients who require [[dialysis]] or have [[chronic kidney disease]], iron should be given with erythropoietin, depending on some laboratory parameters such as [[ferritin]] and [[transferrin]] saturation.<ref name="pmid8914038">{{cite journal |vauthors=Macdougall IC, Tucker B, Thompson J, Tomson CR, Baker LR, Raine AE |title=A randomized controlled study of iron supplementation in patients treated with erythropoietin |journal=Kidney Int. |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages=1694–9 |year=1996 |pmid=8914038|doi=10.1038/ki.1996.487}}</ref> Dialysis patients in the U.S. are most often given Epogen; other brands of epoetin may be used in other countries.

Erythropoietin is also used to treat anemia in people with chronic kidney disease who are not on dialysis (those in Stage 3 or 4 disease and those living with a kidney transplant). There are two types of erythropoietin for people with anemia due to chronic kidney disease (not on dialysis).

=== Anemia caused by cancer ===
{{Expand section|date=November 2007}}
In March 2008, a panel of advisers for the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) supported keeping erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) produced by [[Amgen]] and [[Johnson & Johnson]] on the market for use in cancer patients. The FDA has focused its concern on study results from some clinical trials showing an increased risk of death and [[tumor]] growth in chemotherapy patients taking the anti-anemia drugs.

=== Anemia in critically ill patients ===

Erythropoietin is used to treat people with anemia resulting from critical illness.

In a [[randomized controlled trial]],<ref name="pmid17804841">{{cite journal | vauthors = Corwin HL, Gettinger A, Fabian TC, May A, Pearl RG, Heard S, An R, Bowers PJ, Burton P, Klausner MA, Corwin MJ | title = Efficacy and safety of epoetin alfa in critically ill patients | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 357 | issue = 10 | pages = 965–76 |date=September 2007 | pmid = 17804841 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa071533 | url = | issn = }}</ref> erythropoietin was shown to not change the number of blood transfusions required by critically ill patients. A surprising finding in this study was a small mortality reduction in patients receiving erythropoietin. This result was [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] after 29 days but not at 140 days. The mortality difference was most marked in patients admitted to the [[Intensive care unit|ICU]] for trauma. The authors provide several hypotheses for potential etiologies of this reduced mortality, but, given the known increase in thrombosis and increased benefit in trauma patients as well as marginal nonsignificant benefit (adjusted hazard ratio of 0.9) in surgery patients, it could be speculated that some of the benefit might be secondary to the procoagulant effect of erythropoetin.  Regardless, this study suggests further research may be necessary to see which critical care patients, if any, might benefit from administration of erythropoeitin. Any benefit of erythropoetin use must be weighed against the increased likelihood of [[thrombosis]], which has been demonstrated in numerous trials {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}.

=== Neurological diseases ===

Erythropoietin has been hypothesized to be beneficial in treating certain neurological diseases such as schizophrenia and stroke.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Ehrenreich H, Degner D, Meller J |title=Erythropoietin: a candidate compound for neuroprotection in schizophrenia |journal=Molecular Psychiatry |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=42–54 |date=January 2004 |pmid=14581931 |doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4001442 |url=http://physiologie.univ-lyon1.fr/enseignement/coursLB/Ehrenreich2004.pdf |format=PDF |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305202823/http://physiologie.univ-lyon1.fr/enseignement/coursLB/Ehrenreich2004.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-05 |df= }}</ref> Some research has suggested that erythropoietin improves the survival rate in children suffering from [[cerebral malaria]], which is caused by the malaria parasite's blockage of blood vessels in the brain.<ref name="pmid19008152">{{cite journal| vauthors=Casals-Pascual C, Idro R, Picot S, Roberts DJ, Newton CR| title=Can erythropoietin be used to prevent brain damage in cerebral malaria? | journal=Trends Parasitol | year= 2009 | volume= 25 | issue= 1 | pages= 30–6 | pmid=19008152 | doi=10.1016/j.pt.2008.10.002 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=19008152  }}</ref><ref name="pmid21044627">{{cite journal| vauthors=Core A, Hempel C, Kurtzhals JA, Penkowa M| title=Plasmodium berghei ANKA: erythropoietin activates neural stem cells in an experimental cerebral malaria model. | journal=Exp Parasitol | year= 2011 | volume= 127 | issue= 2 | pages= 500–5 | pmid=21044627 | doi=10.1016/j.exppara.2010.09.010 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=21044627  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/feb/17/medicalresearch.health1 | title = Kidney drug could save children from malaria brain damage | publisher = The Guardian | location=London | first=Robin | last=McKie | date=2008-02-17}}</ref> However, the possibility that erythropoietin may be neuroprotective is inconsistent with the poor transport of the chemical into the brain<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Banks|first1=WA|title=Passage of erythropoietic agents across the blood-brain barrier:|journal=Eur J Pharmacol|date=2004|volume=505|issue=1–3|pages=93–101|doi=10.1016/j.ejphar.2004.10.035}}</ref> and the low levels of erythropoietin receptors expressed on neuronal cells.

=== Preterm Infants ===
Infants born early often require transfusions with red blood cells and have low levels of erythropoietin. Erythropoietin has been studied as a treatment option to reduce [[anemia]] in preterm infants. Treating infants less than 8 days with erythropoietin old may slightly reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions, but increases the risk of [[retinopathy]]. Due to the limited clinical benefit and increased risk of retinopathy, early or late erythropoietin treatment is not recommended for preterm infants.<ref name=Ohlsson2014 /><ref name=Aher2012 />

== Adverse effects ==

Epoetin alfa is generally well tolerated. Common side effects include high blood pressure, headache, disabling cluster migraine (resistant to remedies), joint pain, and clotting at the injection site. Rare cases of stinging at the injection site, skin rash, and [[flu-like symptoms]] (joint and muscle pain) have occurred within a few hours following administration. More serious side effects, including allergic reactions, seizures and thrombotic events (e.g., heart attacks, strokes, and pulmonary embolism) rarely occur. Chronic self-administration of the drug has been shown to cause increases in blood [[hemoglobin]] and [[hematocrit]] to abnormally high levels, resulting in [[dyspnea]] and abdominal pain.<ref>R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 547-549. 
</ref>

Erythropoietin is associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular complications in patients with kidney disease if it is used to target an increase of [[hemoglobin]] levels above 13.0 g/dl.<ref name="pmid17108342">{{cite journal |vauthors=Drüeke TB, Locatelli F, Clyne N, Eckardt KU, Macdougall IC, Tsakiris D, Burger HU, Scherhag A |title=Normalization of hemoglobin level in patients with chronic kidney disease and anemia |journal=N.

Early treatment (before an infant is 8 days old) with erythropoietin correlated with an increase in the risk of [[retinopathy of prematurity]] in premature and anemic infants, raising concern that the angiogenic actions of erythropoietin may exacerbate retinopathy.<ref name=Ohlsson2014>{{Cite journal|last=Ohlsson|first=Arne|last2=Aher|first2=Sanjay M.|date=2014-04-26|title=Early erythropoietin for preventing red blood cell transfusion in preterm and/or low birth weight infants|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=4|pages=CD004863|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004863.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=24771408|via=}}</ref><ref name=Aher2012>{{Cite journal|last=Aher|first=Sanjay M.|last2=Ohlsson|first2=Arne|date=2012-10-17|title=Early versus late erythropoietin for preventing red blood cell transfusion in preterm and/or low birth weight infants|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=10|pages=CD004865|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004865.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=23076909|via=}}</ref> Since anemia itself increases the risk of retinopathy, the correlation with erythropoietin treatment may be incidental.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

=== Safety advisories in anemic cancer patients ===

Amgen sent a "dear doctor" letter in January 2007 that highlighted results from a recent anemia of cancer trial, and warned doctors to consider use in that [[Off-label use|off-label]] indication with caution.

Amgen advised the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regarding the results of the [[DAHANCA]] 10 clinical trial. The DAHANCA 10 data monitoring committee found that three-year loco-regional cancer control in subjects treated with Aranesp was significantly worse than for those not receiving Aranesp (p=0.01).

In response to these advisories, the FDA released a Public Health Advisory<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/advisory/RHE2007.htm |title=FDA Public Health Advisory: Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents (ESAs): Epoetin alfa (marketed as Procrit, Epogen), Darbepoetin alfa (marketed as Aranesp) |accessdate=2007-06-05 |work= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528103823/http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/advisory/RHE2007.htm |archivedate=2007-05-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>
on March 9, 2007, and a clinical alert<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/InfoSheets/HCP/RHE2007HCP.htm |title=Information for Healthcare Professionals: Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA) |accessdate=2007-06-05 |work= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515034509/http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/InfoSheets/HCP/RHE2007HCP.htm |archivedate=2007-05-15 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> for doctors on February 16, 2007, about the use of erythropoeisis-stimulating agents (ESAs) such as [[epogen]] and [[darbepoetin]]. The advisory recommended caution in using these agents in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy or off chemotherapy, and indicated a lack of clinical evidence to support improvements in quality of life or transfusion requirements in these settings.

In addition, on March 9, 2007, drug manufacturers agreed to new [[black box warning]]s about the safety of these drugs.

On March 22, 2007, a congressional inquiry into the safety of erythropoeitic growth factors was reported in the news media.  Manufacturers were asked to suspend drug rebate programs for physicians and to also suspend marketing the drugs to patients.

Several publications and FDA communications have increased the level of concern related to adverse effects of ESA therapy in selected groups. In a revised black box warning, the FDA notes significant risks, advising that ESAs should be used only in patients with cancer when treating anemia specifically caused by chemotherapy, and not for other causes of anemia. Further, the warning states that ESAs should be discontinued once the patient's chemotherapy course has been completed.<ref name="urlMedWatch - 2007 Safety Information Alerts">{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/safety/2007/safety07.htm#ESA2 |title=Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents: Aranesp (darbepoetin alfa), Epogen (epoetin alfa), and Procrit (epoetin alfa) |date=2008-01-03 |format= |work=MedWatch - 2007 Safety Information Alerts |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |pages= |language= |quote= |accessdate=2009-04-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409003452/http://www.fda.gov/MedWatch/safety/2007/safety07.htm |archivedate=April 9, 2009 }}</ref><ref name="urlwww.fda.gov_ Procrit">{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2007/103234s5158lbl.pdf |title=Procrit (Epoetin alfa) for injection |date=2007-08-11 |format= |work= |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118031036/http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2007/103234s5158lbl.pdf |archivedate=January 18, 2009 |quote= |accessdate=2009-04-09 |deadurl=yes }}</ref><ref name="urlwww.fda.gov_ Aranesp">{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2007/103951s5164lbl.pdf |title=Aranesp (darbepoetin alfa) for Injection |date=2007-11-08 |format= |work= |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118031507/http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2007/103951s5164lbl.pdf |archivedate=January 18, 2009 |quote= |accessdate=2009-04-09 |deadurl=yes }}</ref><ref name="urlInformation on Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA) (marketed as Procrit, Epogen, and Aranesp)">{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/infopage/RHE/default.htm | title = Information on Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA) (marketed as Procrit, Epogen, and Aranesp) | date = 2009-01-26 | work = | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration | pages = | language = | quote = | accessdate = 2009-04-09}}</ref>

== Interactions ==

Drug interactions with erythropoietin include:
* '''Major''': [[lenalidomide]]—risk of [[thrombosis]]
* '''Moderate''': [[cyclosporine]]—risk of high blood pressure may be greater in combination with EPO. EPO may lead to variability in blood levels of cyclosporine.
* '''Minor''': [[ACE inhibitors]] may interfere with hematopoiesis by decreasing the synthesis of endogenous erythropoietin or decreasing bone marrow production of red blood cells.<ref>[http://www.drugs.com/drug-interactions/epoetin-alfa,epogen.html/ Drug Interactions of Erythropoietin Alfa at Drugs.com]</ref>

==Controversy==

The publication of an editorial questioning the benefits of high dose epoetin was canceled by the marketing branch of a journal after being accepted by the editorial branch highlighting concerns of conflict of interest in publishing.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hardell L, Walker MJ, Walhjalt B, Friedman LS, Richter ED |title=Secret ties to industry and conflicting interests in cancer research |journal=Am.
