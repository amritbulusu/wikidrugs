'''UR-144''' ('''TMCP-018''', '''KM-X1''', '''MN-001''', '''YX-17''') is a drug invented by [[Abbott Laboratories]],<ref name = "WO2006/069196">{{cite patent |country= WO |number= 2006069196 |status= application |title= 3-Cycloalkylcarbonyl indoles as cannabinoid receptor ligands |pubdate= 2006-06-29 |inventor=  Pace JM, Tietje K, Dart MJ, Meyer MD |assign1=  Abbott Laboratories }}</ref> that acts as a selective [[full agonist]] of the peripheral [[cannabinoid receptor]] [[Cannabinoid receptor 2|CB<sub>2</sub>]], but with much lower [[Affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for the psychoactive [[Cannabinoid receptor 1|CB<sub>1</sub>]] receptor.

==Pharmacology==
UR-144 has high affinity for the CB<sub>2</sub> receptor with a K<sub>i</sub> of 1.8 nM but 83x lower affinity for the CB<sub>1</sub> receptor with a K<sub>i</sub> of 150 nM.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1= Frost |first1= J.

Chemically it is closely related to other 2,2,3,3-tetramethylcyclopropyl synthetic cannabinoids like [[A-796,260]] and [[A-834,735]] but with a different substitution on the 1-position of the indole core, in these compounds its 1-pentyl group is replaced with alkylheterocycles like 1-(2-morpholinoethyl) and 1-(tetrahydropyran-4-ylmethyl).

==Legality==

The UK ACMD recommended that generic prohibition legislation be extended to include UR-144 in October 2012.<ref name="ACMDreport">{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/acmd-further-consideration-of-the-synthetic-cannabinoids | title=Further consideration of the synthetic cannabinoids | publisher=UK Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs | date=18 October 2012 | accessdate=13 December 2014 | pages=14}}</ref> The UK Home Office accepted the recommendation and enacted legislation to ban UR-144 as a [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971|class B]] drug along with a number of other drugs on February 26, 2013 as a part of [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/239/made The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Amendment) Order 2013].

UR-144 has been detected as an ingredient of [[synthetic cannabis]] smoking blends in New Zealand, and subsequently banned from sale as a [[temporary class drug]] on 6 April 2012.<ref>[http://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/mental-health-and-addictions/drug-policy/temporary-class-drug-notices Temporary Class Drug Notices. New Zealand Ministry of Health]</ref> It has also been encountered in smoking blends and subsequently banned in Russia.<ref name="pmid23042760">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sobolevsky T, Prasolov I, Rodchenkov G | title = Detection of urinary metabolites of AM-2201 and UR-144, two novel synthetic cannabinoids | journal = Drug Test Anal | volume = 4| issue = | pages = 745–753|date=October 2012 | pmid = 23042760 | doi = 10.1002/dta.1418 }}</ref>

As of October 2015 UR-144 is a controlled substance in China.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sfda.gov.cn/WS01/CL0056/130753.html | title=关于印发《非药用类麻醉药品和精神药品列管办法》的通知 | publisher=China Food and Drug Administration | date=27 September 2015 | language=Chinese | accessdate=1 October 2015}}</ref>

UR-144 is banned in the Czech Republic.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mzcr.cz/Admin/_upload/files/3/Nov%C3%A9%20PL.pdf | title=Látky, o které byl doplněn seznam č. 4 psychotropních látek (příloha č. 4 k nařízení  vlády č. 463/2013 Sb.) | publisher=Ministerstvo zdravotnictví | language=Czech}}</ref>

==Detection==
A forensic standard of UR-144 is available, and the compound has been posted on the Forendex website of potential drugs of abuse.<ref>Southern Association of Forensic Scientists http://forendex.southernforensic.org/index.php/detail/index/1218</ref> An ELISA immunoassay technique for detecting UR-144 in urine as part of general drug screens has been developed by Tulip Biolabs, Inc. An Homogeneous Immunoassay that runs on most Clinical Chemistry Analyzers and detects several UR and XLR synthetic cannabinoids has been developed and introduced by Immunalysis Inc. Pomona USA.
