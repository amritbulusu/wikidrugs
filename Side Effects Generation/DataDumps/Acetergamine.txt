'''Acetergamine''' is a [[organic chemical]] compound; specifically it is a derivative of [[ergoline]], making it a member of the [[ergotamine]] family of compounds. Acetergamine currently has no mainstream uses, however its potential as an [[alpha-1 blocker]] and [[vasodilator]] has led to it being covered in several patents concerning therapies for erectile dysfunction. It has also been investigated as a treatment for [[cerebellar ataxia]].<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=15233578 |year=2004 |last1=Ogawa |first1=M |title=Pharmacological treatments of cerebellar ataxia |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=107–11 |doi=10.1080/147342204100032331 |journal=Cerebellum |location=London)}}</ref>
