== History ==
=== 1950s to 2000s ===
[[File:ZoetisBuilding.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Zoetis building in Exton, PA]]
In the 1950s, Pfizer began research on several drugs including [[Oxytetracycline]].<ref name="SEC" /> John McKeen, a chemical engineer with Pfizer products, discovered its effective use in livestock. In 1952, the Pfizer Agriculture Division opened a 732-acre research and development facility in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]] called Vigo.<ref name="SEC">{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1555280/000119312512350448/d381653ds1.htm|title=Form S-1|date=10 August 2012|publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]|accessdate=2 February 2013|location=WASHINGTON, D.C}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/568975732.html?dids=568975732:568975732&FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:AI&type=historic&date=Jul+17%2C+1958&author=&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=Pfizer+Buys+732+Acre+Vigo+Chemical+Plant&pqatl=google|title=Pfizer Buys 732 Acre Vigo Chemical Plant|date=17 Jul 1958|work=[[Chicago Daily Tribune]]|page=1|accessdate=2 February 2013}}</ref> By 1988 the division was renamed Pfizer Animal Health.<ref name="SEC" />

The acquisition of [[GlaxoSmithKline]]’s Norden Laboratories in 1995 boosted Pfizer's animal health division into small animal care including domestic pets.<ref name="SEC" /> Secondary research and development centres were opened in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]] in 2003.<ref name="SEC" /> In the same year, Pfizer acquired [[Pharmacia Corporation]] for [[US$]] 60 billion in stock options.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1026684057282753560|title=Pfizer to Buy Pharmacia For $60 Billion in Stock|date=15 July 2002|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=2 February 2013|first1=Robert|last1=Frank|first2=Scott|last2=Hensley}}</ref> Between 2007 and 2011 the company acquired Embrex Inc, Catapult Genetics, Bovigen, [[Wyeth]], Fort Dodge Animal Health, Vetnex Animal Health Ltd, Synbiotics Corporation, Microtek, [[King Pharmaceuticals]], and [[Alpharma]].<ref name="SEC" /> These acquisitions greatly increased Pfizer's market, range of products, countries it operated in, and resources.

=== 2010s to present ===
Plans to break away Pfizer Animal Health into a separate company were officially announced in 2012.<ref name="CBSIPO" /> The name chosen, Zoetis, roughly translates from the derived Latin zoological word zoetic, meaning 'pertaining to life'.<ref name="CBSIPO" />

In 2011, Zoetis Inc.'s revenues exceeded $4.2 billion and $4.34 billion in 2012.<ref name="WSJ2" /><ref name="CBSIPO" /> The animal health industry worldwide is an estimated [[US$]]22 billion dollar industry.<ref name="CBSIPO" />

On 22 May 2013, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that Pfizer plans to sell its majority stake in the company.<ref name="WSJ2">{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323975004578498994013821124|title=Pfizer to Spin Off Remaining Zoetis Stake|last=Loftus|first=Peter|date=22 May 2013|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref> According to the report, shareholders will have the option to swap their Pfizer shares for Zoetis shares.<ref name="WSJ2" /> The sell off of Zoetis is consistent with Pfizer's recent decision to shed other non-pharmaceuticals subsidiaries in an effort to save costs, raise capital, and pay off debt. The company has announced that JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, [[Goldman Sachs|Goldman Sachs & Co.]], and Morgan Stanley will be the lead underwriters.<ref name="WSJ2" />

In November 2014, activist investor [[Bill Ackman]] disclosed that [[Pershing Square Capital Management]] had taken an 8.5% stake in the company, amassing approximately 41.8 million shares, causing the share price to hit its highest price since the IPO.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-11/ackman-s-pershing-square-takes-stake-in-animal-drugmaker-zoetis.html | work=Bloomberg | first=Caroline | last=Chen | title=Ackman's Pershing Square Takes Stake in Drugmaker Zoetis | date=11 November 2014}}</ref> On  17 November, the company announced it would acquire a portfolio of pet drugs from [[Abbott Laboratories]] for approximately $255 million.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-17/zoetis-buys-abbott-s-animal-health-assets-in-255-million-deal.html | work=Bloomberg | first=Caroline | last=Chen | title=Zoetis Buys Abbott Animal Health Assets in $255 Million Deal | date=17 November 2014}}</ref>

In November 2015 the company announced it would acquire developer of aquaculture treatments and diseases, [[Pharmaq]], for $765 million.<ref>http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/zoetis-purchasing-pharmaq-for-765m/81251930/</ref>
