==Mechanisms of action==
Teriflunomide is an [[immunomodulatory]] drug inhibiting [[pyrimidine]] [[de novo synthesis]] by blocking the enzyme [[dihydroorotate dehydrogenase]]. 
It is uncertain whether this explains its effect on MS lesions.<ref>{{cite journal

Teriflunomide inhibits rapidly dividing cells, including activated T cells, which are thought to drive the disease process in MS. Teriflunomide may decrease the risk of infections compared to chemotherapy-like drugs because of its more-limited effects on the immune system.<ref>{{cite journal

It has been found that teriflunomide blocks the transcription factor [[NF-κB]]. It also inhibits [[tyrosine kinase]] enzymes, but only in high doses not clinically used.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Breedveld|first=FC|author2=Dayer, J-M |date=November 2000|title=Leflunomide: mode of action in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis|journal=Ann Rheum Dis|volume=59|pages=841–849|doi=10.1136/ard.59.11.841|pmid=11053058|issue=11|pmc=1753034}}</ref>

==Activation of leflunomide to teriflunomide==
The branded drug teriflunomide is the main active ''[[in vivo]]'' metabolite of the [[Generic drug|generically]] available leflunomide. Upon administration of leflunomide, 70% of the drug administered converts into teriflunomide. The only difference between the molecules is the opening of the isoxazole ring. This is considered a simple structural modification and a technically simple one-step synthetic transformation. Upon oral administration of leflunomide ''in vivo'', the isoxazole ring of leflunomide is opened and teriflunomide is formed.<ref name = "Melchiorri">{{cite web|last1=Melchiorri|first1=Daniela|last2=Barbara|first2=van Zwieten-Boot|last3=Romaldas|first3=Maciulaitis|last4=Nela|first4=Vilceanu|last5=Karsten|first5=Bruins Slot|last6=Ian|first6=Hudson|last7=Robert|first7=Hemmings|last8=Harald|first8=Enzmann|last9=Pierre|first9=Demolis|title=Assessment report.

[[File:Activation of leflunomide.svg|thumb|center|425px|'''Teriflunomide''' is the only active metabolite of [[leflunomide]], completely responsible for its therapeutic actions. It results from the reaction of isoxazole ring opening, which occurs ''[[in vivo]]''. Teriflunomide then can interconvert between the [[E-Z notation|''E'' and ''Z'']] [[enol]]ic forms (and the corresponding keto-amide), the ''Z''-enol being the most stable and therefore most predominant form.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rozman|first1=B|title=Clinical Pharmacokinetics of Leflunomide.|journal=Clinical pharmacokinetics|date=2002|volume=41|issue=6|pages=421–30|pmid=12074690|doi=10.2165/00003088-200241060-00003}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Clinical Pharmacology/Biopharmaceutics Review.

"Regardless of the substance administered (leflunomide or teriflunomide), it is the same molecule (teriflunomide)—the one exerting the pharmacological, immunological or metabolic action in view of restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions, and does not present, in clinical use, a new chemical entity to patients."<ref name = "Melchiorri" /> Because of this, [[European Medicines Agency|EMA]] initially had not considered teriflunomide being a new active substance.<ref>{{cite web|title=Summary of Opinion (Initial Authorisation): Aubagio (teriflunomide)|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Summary_of_opinion_-_Initial_authorisation/human/002514/WC500144913.pdf|publisher=European Medicines Agency|accessdate=15 April 2016}}</ref>
