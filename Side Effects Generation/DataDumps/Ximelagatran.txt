'''Ximelagatran''' ('''Exanta''' or '''Exarta''', H 376/95) is an [[anticoagulant]] that has been investigated extensively as a replacement for [[warfarin]]<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hirsh J, O'Donnell M, Eikelboom JW |title=Beyond unfractionated heparin and warfarin: current and future advances |journal=Circulation |volume=116 |issue=5 |pages=552–560 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17664384 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.685974 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/116/5/552}}</ref> that would overcome the problematic [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary]], [[drug interaction]], and [[therapeutic drug monitoring|monitoring]] issues associated with warfarin therapy. In 2006, its manufacturer [[AstraZeneca]] announced that it would withdraw pending applications for marketing approval after reports of [[hepatotoxicity]] (liver damage) during trials, and discontinue its distribution in countries where the drug had been approved (Germany, Portugal, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Iceland, Austria, Denmark, France, Switzerland, Argentina and Brazil).<ref name="az">{{cite press release

==Method of action==
Ximelagatran, a [[direct thrombin inhibitor]],<ref name="pmid17319469">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ho SJ, Brighton TA |title=Ximelagatran: direct thrombin inhibitor |journal=Vasc Health Risk Manag |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=49–58 |year=2006 |pmid=17319469 |pmc=1993972 |doi= 10.2147/vhrm.2006.2.1.49|url=}}</ref> was the first member of this class that can be taken orally. It acts solely by inhibiting the actions of [[thrombin]]. It is taken orally twice daily, and rapidly absorbed by the [[small intestine]]. Ximelagatran is a [[prodrug]], being converted ''[[in vivo]]'' to the active agent '''melagatran'''. This conversion takes place in the liver and many other tissues through [[hydrolysis]] and [[dehydroxylation]] (replacing the [[ethyl group|ethyl]] and [[hydroxyl]] groups with [[hydrogen]]).

==Uses==
Ximelagatran was expected to replace [[warfarin]] and sometimes [[aspirin]] and [[heparin]] in many therapeutic settings, including [[deep venous thrombosis]], prevention of secondary venous [[thromboembolism]] and complications of [[atrial fibrillation]] such as stroke. The efficacy of ximelagatran for these indications had been well documented,<ref>{{cite journal

An advantage, according to early reports by its manufacturer, was that it could be taken orally without any monitoring of its anticoagulant properties. This would have set it apart from [[warfarin]] and [[heparin]], which require monitoring of the [[international normalized ratio]] (INR) and the [[partial thromboplastin time]] (PTT), respectively. A disadvantage recognised early was the absence of an [[antidote]] in case acute bleeding develops, while warfarin can be antagonised by [[vitamin K]] and heparin by [[protamine sulfate]].

==Side-effects==
Ximelagatran was generally well tolerated in the trial populations, but a small proportion (5-6%) developed elevated [[liver enzyme]] levels, which prompted the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] to reject an initial application for approval in 2004. The further development was discontinued in 2006 following reports of hepatotoxicity. Subsequent analysis of Phase 2 clinical study data using extreme value modelling (see [[Extreme value theory]]) showed that the elevated [[liver enzyme]] levels observed in Phase 3 clinical studies could have been predicted; if this had been known at the time, it might have affected decisions on future development of the compound.<ref name="Southworth 2014">{{cite journal|last1=Southworth|first1=Harry|title=Predicting potential liver toxicity from phase 2 data: a case study with ximelagatran|journal=Statistics in Medicine|date=30 Jul 2014|volume=33|issue=17|pages=2914–2923|doi=10.1002/sim.6142|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.6142/full|accessdate=6 January 2017|ref=Southworth 2014}}</ref>

According to AstraZeneca, a chemically different but pharmacologically similar substance, AZD0837, is undergoing testing for similar indications.<ref name="az" />
