==Medical use==
It has a medical use in [[obstetrics]] to facilitate delivery of the [[placenta]] and to prevent [[bleeding]] after [[childbirth]] by causing [[smooth muscle]] tissue in the [[blood vessel]] walls to narrow, thereby reducing blood flow. It is usually combined with [[oxytocin]] (Syntocinon) as [[syntometrine]].

It can induce spasm of the [[coronary arteries]].<ref name="pmid16162623">{{cite journal |vauthors=Romagnoli E, Niccoli G, Crea F |title=Images in cardiology: A coronary organic stenosis distal to severe, ergonovine induced spasm: decision making |journal=Heart |volume=91 |issue=10 |page=1310 |date=October 2005 |pmid=16162623 |pmc=1769140 |doi=10.1136/hrt.2004.058560 |url=http://heart.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16162623}}</ref> It is used to diagnose [[Prinzmetal's angina|variant (Prinzmetal's) angina]].<ref name="pmid10987346">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sunagawa O, Shinzato Y, Touma T, Tomori M, Fukiyama K |title=Differences between coronary hyperresponsiveness to ergonovine and vasospastic angina |journal=Jpn Heart J |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=257–68 |date=May 2000 |pmid=10987346 |doi= 10.1536/jhj.41.257}}</ref>

==Side effects==
Possible side effects include [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], abdominal pain, [[diarrhea]], [[headache]], [[dizziness]], [[tinnitus]], [[chest pain]], [[palpitation]], [[bradycardia]], transient hypertension and other cardiac [[arrhythmias]], [[dyspnea]], [[rashes]], and [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]].<ref>[http://www.drugsupdate.com/generic/view/138 Ergometrine drug information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425092448/http://www.drugsupdate.com/generic/view/138 |date=2012-04-25 }}</ref> An overdose produces a characteristic poisoning, [[ergotism]] or "St. Anthony's fire": prolonged [[vasospasm]] resulting in [[gangrene]] and amputations; hallucinations and dementia; and abortions.

==Mechanism of action==
While it acts at [[alpha-adrenergic receptor|alpha-adrenergic]], [[dopamine receptor|dopaminergic]], and [[serotonin receptor]]s (the [[5-HT2 receptor|5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor]]), it exerts on the [[uterus]] (and other [[smooth muscles]]) a powerful stimulant effect not clearly associated with a specific receptor type.

==History==

The pharmacological properties of ergot were known and had been utilised by midwives for centuries, but were not thoroughly researched and publicised until the early 20th century. However, its abortifacient effects and the danger of ergotism meant that it was only prescribed cautiously, as in the treatment of [[postpartum haemorrhage]].<ref name="decosta">{{cite journal |last=De Costa |first=Caroline |date=May 2002 |title=St Anthony's fire and living ligatures: a short history of ergometrine |url= |journal=Lancet |publisher= |volume=359 |issue=9319 |pages=1768–1770 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08658-0 |pmid=12049883}}<!--|accessdate=3 December 2014--></ref>

Ergometrine was first isolated and obtained by the chemists [[Chassar Moir|C Moir]] and H W Dudley in 1935.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Dudley |first=H W |last2=Moir |first2=C |date=1935 |title=The substance responsible for the traditional clinical effect of ergot |url= |journal=BMJ |publisher= |volume=1|issue=|pages=520–523 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.1.3871.520}}<!--|accessdate=3 December 2014--></ref> Caroline De Costa has argued that the adoption of ergometrine for [[prophylatic]] use and for treating haemorrhaging contributed to the decline in the [[maternal mortality rate]] in much of the West during the early 20th century.<ref name="decosta" />

==Legal status==
Ergometrine is listed as Table I precursors under the [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]], as possible precursor compound for LSD.<ref>[http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/red.pdf List Of Precursors And Chemicals Frequently Used In The Illicit Manufacture Of Narcotic Drugs And Psychotropic Substances Under International Control] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227224025/http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/red.pdf |date=February 27, 2008 }}.</ref> As an N-alkyl derivative of lysergamide, ergometrine is also covered by the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]], effectively rendering it illegal in the [[United Kingdom]].
