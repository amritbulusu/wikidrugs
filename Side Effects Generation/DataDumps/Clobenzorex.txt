'''Clobenzorex''' ('''Asenlix''', '''Dinintel''', '''Finedal''', '''Rexigen''') is a [[stimulant]] [[drug]] of the [[phenethylamine]] and [[amphetamine]] [[chemical class]]es used as an [[appetite suppressant]]. The drug is legally distributed in [[Mexico]] under the trade name Asenlix by [[Aventis]].

Chemically, clobenzorex is an ''N''-substituted amphetamine analog that is converted to [[amphetamine|''d''-amphetamine]] soon after ingestion. In commercial production, clobenzorex is supplied in 30&nbsp;mg doses as the hydrochloride salt in green-tinted capsules. The drug gained use as a prescription anorectic in the 1970s; however, adverse reactions were eventually observed, which led to the prohibition of clobenzorex in the United States and certain other countries.<ref>[http://www.sat-tox.org/galveston.html Galveston SAT Meeting -Fall 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911115701/http://www.sat-tox.org/galveston.html |date=2006-09-11 }}</ref>

In the United States, clobenzorex tablets (among other varieties of stimulants, such as amphetamine) have been used by athletes who ingest the drug to reduce fatigue, increase attention, and improve reaction times during athletic activities. The green-tinted Asenlix capsules (generic forms can be seen as half light green, half dark green capsules marked "IFA") are known as "greenies" among US baseball players, a slang term that in current use has expanded to generically refer to any amphetamine class stimulant.
