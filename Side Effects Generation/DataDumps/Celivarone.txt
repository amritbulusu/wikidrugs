== Molecular causes of cardiac arrhythmias ==
The causes of cardiac arrhythmias are numerous, from structural changes in the [[Conduction system of the heart|conduction system]] (the [[Sinoatrial node|sinoatrial]] and [[atrioventricular node]]s, or His-Purkinje system) and [[cardiac muscle]],<ref name = "Hoffmann" /> to [[mutation]]s in genes coding for [[ion channel]]s of the [[heart]]. Movement of ions, particularly [[Sodium|Na<sup>+</sup>]], [[Calcium|Ca<sup>2+</sup>]] and [[Potassium|K<sup>+</sup>]], causes [[depolarization]]s of [[cell membrane]]s in node cells, which are then transmitted to cardiac muscle cells to induce contraction. After depolarization, the ions are moved back to their original locations, leading to repolarization of the membrane and relaxation.<ref name = "Chapman">{{cite journal|last1=Chapman|first1=RA|title=Excitation-contraction Coupling in Cardiac Muscle|journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology|date=January 1980|volume=35|pages=1–52|doi=10.1016/0079-6107(80)90002-4}}</ref> Disruptions in ion flow affect the heart’s ability to contract by altering the resting membrane potential, affecting the cell’s ability to conduct or transmit an [[Action Potential|action potential (AP)]], or by affecting the rate or force of contraction.<ref name = "Chapman" />

The specific molecular changes involved in arrhythmias depend on the nature of the problem. Ion channel mutations can alter [[protein conformation]], and so change the amount of current flowing through these channels. Due to changes in [[amino acid]]s and binding domains, mutations may also affect the ability of these channels to respond to physiological changes in cardiac demand.<ref name = "Keating">{{cite journal|last1=Keating|first1=MT|last2=Sanguinetti|first2=MC|title=Pathophysiology of Ion Channel Mutations|journal=Current Opinion in Genetics & Development|date=June 1996|volume=6|issue=3|pages=326–333|doi=10.1016/S0959-437X(96)80010-4|pmid=8791523}}</ref> Mutations resulting in loss of function of K<sup>+</sup> channels can result in delayed repolarization of the cardiac muscle cells. Similarly, gain of function of Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels results in delayed repolarization, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload causing increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to cardiac [[troponin C]], more [[actin]]-[[myosin]] interactions and causing an increased [[contractility]], respectively.<ref name = "Chapman" /> Mutations cause many arrhythmic conditions, including [[Atrial Fibrillation|atrial fibrillation (AF)]], [[Atrial Flutter|atrial flutter (AFl)]], and [[Ventricular Fibrillation|ventricular fibrillation (V-Fib)]].<ref name = "Wang">{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Q|last2=Curran|first2=ME|last3=Splawski|first3=I|last4=Burn|first4=TC|last5=Millholland|first5=JM|last6=VanRaay|first6=TJ|last7=Shen|first7=J|last8=Timothy|first8=KW|last9=Vincent|first9=GM|last10=de Jager|first10=T|last11=Schwartz|first11=PJ|last12=Towbin|first12=JA|last13=Moss|first13=AJ|last14=Atkinson|first14=DL|last15=Landes|first15=GM|last16=Connors|first16=TD|last17=Keating|first17=MT|title=Positional Cloning of a Novel Potassium Channel Gene: ''KVLQT1'' Mutations Cause Cardiac Arrhythmias|journal=Nature Genetics|date=January 1996|volume=12|issue=1|pages=17–23|doi=10.1038/ng0196-17|pmid=8528244}}</ref><ref name = "Abbott">{{cite journal|last1=Abbott|first1=GW|last2=Sesti|first2=F|last3=Splawski|first3=I|last4=Buck|first4=ME|last5=Lehmann|first5=MH|last6=Timothy|first6=KW|last7=Keating|first7=MT|last8=Goldstein|first8=SAN|title=MiRP1 Forms ''I''<sub>Kr</sub> Potassium Channels with hERG and Is Associated with Cardiac Arrhythmia|journal=Cell|date=April 1999|volume=97|issue=2|pages=175–187|doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80728-X|pmid=10219239}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Priori|first1=SG|last2=Napolitano|first2=C|last3=Tiso|first3=N|last4=Memmi|first4=M|last5=Vignati|first5=G|last6=Bloise|first6=R|last7=Sorrentino|first7=V|last8=Danieli|first8=GA|title=Mutations in the Cardiac Ryanodine Receptor Gene (''hRyR2'') Underlie Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia|journal=Circulation|date=16 January 2001|volume=103|issue=2|pages=196–200|doi=10.1161/01.CIR.103.2.196|pmid=11208676}}</ref> Arrhythmias can also be induced by altered activity of the [[vagus nerve]] and activation of [[Beta-1 adrenergic receptor|β<sub>1</sub> adrenergic receptor]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Abildskov|first1=JA|title=The Sympathetic Imbalance Hypothesis of QT Interval Prolongation|journal=Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology|date=August 1991|volume=2|issue=4|pages=355–359|doi=10.1111/j.1540-8167.1991.tb01332.x}}</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==
Celivarone is a non-iodinated [[benzofuran]] derivative, structurally related to [[amiodarone]], a drug commonly used to treat arrhythmias.<ref name = "Gautier" /> Celivarone has potential as an antiarrhythmic agent, attributable to its multifactorial mechanism of action; blocking [[Sodium channel|Na<sup>+</sup>]], [[L-type calcium channel|<small>L</small>-type Ca<sup>2+</sup>]] and many types of [[Potassium channel|K<sup>+</sup> channel]]s ([[hERG|''I''<sub>Kr</sub>]], [[KCNE1|''I''<sub>Ks</sub>]], [[G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channel|''I''<sub>KACh</sub>]] and [[KCNA5|''I''K<sub>v</sub>1.5]]), as well as inhibiting β<sub>1</sub> receptors, all in dose-dependent manners.<ref name = "Gautier"/><ref name = "Kowey">{{cite journal|last1=Kowey|first1=PR|last2=Aliot|first2=EM|last3=Cappucci|first3=A|last4=Connolly|first4=SJ|last5=Crijns|first5=HJ|last6=Hohnloser|first6=SH|last7=Kulakowski|first7=P|last8=Roy|first8=D|last9=Radzik|first9=D|last10=Singh|first10=BN|title=Placebo-controlled, Double-blind Dose-ranging Study of the Efficacy and Safety of SSR149744C in Patients with Recent Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter [abstract]|journal=Heart Rhythm|date=2007|volume=5|issue=Suppl|page=S72}}</ref> The mechanisms by which celivarone modifies ion flow through these channels is unknown, but hearts demonstrate longer PQ intervals and decreased cell shortening, indicative of blocked <small>L</small>-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, depressed maximum current with each action potential with no change in the [[resting membrane potential]], caused by blocked Na<sup>+</sup> channels, and longer action potential duration due to K<sup>+</sup> channel blocks.<ref name = "Gautier"/><ref name = "Gautier2">{{cite journal|last1=Gautier|first1=P|last2=Serre|first2=M|last3=Cosnier-Pucheu|first3=S|last4=Djandjighian|first4=L|last5=Roccon|first5=A|last6=Herbert|first6=JM|last7=Nisato|first7=D|title=''In vivo'' and ''in vitro'' Antiarrhythmic Effects of SSR149744C in Animal Models of Atrial Fibrillation and Ventricular Arrhythmias|journal=Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology|date=February 2005|volume=45|issue=2|pages=125–135|doi=10.1097/01.fjc.0000151899.03379.76|pmid=15654261}}</ref> Celivarone is therefore described as having class I, II, III, and IV antiarrhythmic properties.<ref name = "Gautier"/><ref name = "Gautier2" />

== Indications for use ==
Celivarone displays some atrial selectivity, suggesting it may be most effective at targeting atrial arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.<ref name = "Gautier"/><ref name = "Kowey" /><ref name = "Gautier2" /><ref name = "Cosnier-pucheu">{{cite journal|last1=Cosnier-pucheu|first1=S|last2=Roccon|first2=A|last3=Rizzoli|first3=G|last4=Gayraud|first4=R|last5=Guiraudou|first5=P|last6=Briand|first6=D|last7=Roque|first7=C|last8=Gautier|first8=P|last9=Herbert|first9=JM|last10=Nisato|first10=D|title=301 SSR149744, a New Antiarrhythmic Drug, Prevents Experimental Induced Atrial Fibrillation|journal=European Journal of Heart Failure Supplements|date=June 2003|volume=2|issue=1|pages=53–54|doi=10.1016/S1567-4215(03)90164-0}}</ref> These conditions are characterized by rapid atrial rates, 400–600 bpm for atrial fibrillation and 150–300 bpm for atrial flutter.<ref name = "Hoffmann" /> Studies have shown celivarone is capable of cardioversion and of maintaining normal [[Sinus rhythm|sinus cardiac rhythms]]<ref name = "Gautier" /><ref name = "Gautier2" /> and that it is effective in [[Hypokalemia|hypokalemic]], vasotonic, and stretch-induced atrial fibrillation, as well as ischemic and reperfusion ventricular fibrillation.<ref name = "Gautier2" /> Since it affects multiple ion channels, it also shows promise in treating genetic forms of arrhythmia caused by several ion channel mutations.<ref name = "Gautier" /><ref name = "Gautier2" />

== Future research ==
Celivarone may be an effective [[Antihypertensive drug|antihypertensive]] therapy, as it inhibits both [[angiotensin II]] and [[phenylephrine]] induced [[hypertension]] in dogs, despite having no affinity for these receptors.<ref name = "Gautier" /> Atrial fibrillation is especially common in hypertensive adults<ref name = "Hoffmann" /> so a single drug to combat both problems is desirable. The non-iodinated nature of celivarone means that the harmful side-effects on the [[thyroid]] commonly seen with amiodarone therapy are eliminated, making the drug an attractive alternative.<ref name = "Gautier" /><ref name = "Gautier2" /> Higher oral [[bioavailability]], shorter duration of action, and lower accumulation in [[body tissue]]s are also benefits of celivarone.<ref name = "Gautier" /><ref name = "Gautier2" /> Presently, two studies are underway to determine if the effects observed in the animal models are reproducible in a human population.<ref>{{cite web|title=Double Blind Placebo Controlled Dose Ranging Study of the Efficacy and Safety of SSR149744C 300 or 600 mg for the Conversion of Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter (CORYFEE)|url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00232310|website=ClinicalTrials.gov|accessdate=6 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Dose Ranging Study of Celivarone with Amiodarone as Calibrator for the Prevention of Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) Interventions or Death (ALPHEE)|url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00993382|website=ClinicalTrials.gov|accessdate=6 January 2016}}</ref>
