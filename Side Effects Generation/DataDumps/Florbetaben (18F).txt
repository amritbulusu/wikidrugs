'''Florbetaben''', a fluorine-18 (18F)-labeled stilbene derivative (formerly known as '''BAY-949172'''), trade name '''NeuraCeq ''', is a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical developed for routine clinical application to visualize β-amyloid plaques in the brain. It is indicated for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of β-amyloid neuritic plaque density in the brains of adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other causes of cognitive impairment. The tracer successfully completed a global multicenter phase 0–III development program and obtained approval in Europe, US and South Korea in 2014.<ref name=US>{{ cite news|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/204677s000lbl.pdf | date=2014|title= Piramal Imaging, ''NeuraCeq™ - Prescribing Information (US) '' |publisher=FDA }}</ref><ref name=EU>{{ cite news|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Product_Information/human/002553/WC500162592.pdf

==Alzheimer’s disease and amyloid-beta PET imaging==
More than 44 million people worldwide have been diagnosed with some type of dementia, with two-thirds of this population likely to suffer from a mild, moderate or even severe form of AD.

When used in conjunction with other clinical tests, florbetaben can assist in the diagnosis of AD by detecting the presence or absence of β-amyloid plaques. This is particularly relevant at the prodromal AD stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and at the dementia stage of this disease, where clinical tests lack accuracy to establish a trustworthy AD diagnosis.<ref name=Beach /><ref>{{ cite journal|author= Doraiswamy, P.M.| title= A Florbetapir F 18 amyloid PET and 36-month cognitive decline: a prospective multicenter study | url= http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4195975/pdf/mp20149a.pdf | journal = Molecular Psychiatry |date=2014 | volume=19| pages=1044–51 | doi= 10.1038/mp.2014.9 |display-authors=etal | pmc=4195975 | pmid=24614494}}</ref>

Florbetaben PET imaging showed strong tracer accumulation in the anatomically matched brain regions confirmed to have β-amyloid plaques by postmortem histopathology, thus providing direct target validation for florbetaben. Evaluation of whole brain florbetaben PET images using the clinically applicable visual assessment method demonstrated that florbetaben provides good diagnostic efficacy in detecting/excluding cerebral neuritic β-amyloid plaques. Sensitivity and specificity of the whole brain assessment was 98 and 89%, respectively, against the histopathological standard of truth. Good agreement between blinded readers (kappa 0.90) was reported. Furthermore, high negative and positive predictive values were reported for florbetaben imaging to exclude or detect β-amyloid plaques (negative predictive value 96.0% and positive predictive value 93.9%, see <ref name=Sabri />). Intravenous injections of florbetaben are generally well tolerated in all subject groups. Analysis of 872 patients with 978 florbetaben administrations found no serious adverse reactions related to the tracer.<ref name=US /> All adverse reactions reported were mild to moderate in severity and temporary only. The most common reactions (incidence < 1%) were injection-site pain (3.9% of patients), injection-site erythema (1.7%) and injection-site irritation (1.2%).<ref name=US /> There was no overall difference in the tolerability of florbetaben between different age populations.<ref name=US /> Repeated annual florbetaben injections showed no differences in the tolerability profile.<ref name=EU /> Risks and side effects are addressed in the patient information leaflet.<ref name=US /><ref name=EU /> You may also ask your doctor or pharmacist for further information.
