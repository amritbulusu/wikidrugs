'''Delavirdine''' ('''DLV''') (brand name '''Rescriptor''') is a non-nucleoside [[reverse transcriptase inhibitor]] (NNRTI) marketed by [[ViiV Healthcare]]. It is used as part of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for the treatment of [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) type 1. It is presented as the mesylate. The recommended dosage is 400&nbsp;mg, three times a day.

Although delavirdine was approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] in 1997, its efficacy is lower than other NNRTIs, especially [[efavirenz]], and it also has an inconvenient schedule. These factors have led the U.S. DHHS not to recommend its use as part of initial therapy.<ref name="dhhs">DHHS panel. Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in HIV-1-infected adults and adolescents (May 4, 2006). (Available for download from [http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov/Guidelines/GuidelineDetail.aspx?MenuItem=Guidelines&Search=Off&GuidelineID=7&ClassID=1 AIDSInfo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506193229/http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/Guidelines/GuidelineDetail.aspx?MenuItem=Guidelines&Search=Off&GuidelineID=7&ClassID=1 |date=2006-05-06 }})</ref>
The risk of cross-resistance across the NNRTI class, as well as its complex set of drug interactions, make the place of delavirdine in second-line and [[salvage therapy]] unclear, and it is currently rarely used.

==Interactions==
Like [[ritonavir]], delavirdine is an inhibitor of [[cytochrome P450]] isozyme [[CYP3A4]], and interacts with many medications. It should not be administered with a wide range of drugs, including [[amprenavir]], [[fosamprenavir]], [[simvastatin]], [[lovastatin]], [[rifampin]], [[rifabutin]], [[rifapentine]], [[Hypericum perforatum|St John's wort]], [[astemizole]], [[midazolam]], [[triazolam]], [[ergot]] medications, and several medications for [[acid reflux]].<ref name="dhhs" />

==Adverse effects==
The most common adverse event is moderate to severe [[rash]], which occurs in up to 20% of patients.<ref>[http://www.pfizer.com/pfizer/download/uspi_rescriptor.pdf RESCRIPTOR brand of delavirdine mesylate tablets. Product information.]</ref> Other common adverse events include [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], [[headache]] and [[nausea]]. Liver toxicity has also been reported.

Modification of the scheme that was done for [[ateviridine]] [[q.v.]] by performing the [[reductive alkylation]] with acetone gives '''2''' after removal of the protecting group. Acylation of this amine with the imidazolide from 5-Methylsulfonaminoindole-2-carboxylic acid ('''1''') affords the amide, [[reverse transcriptase inhibitor]], atevirdine.
