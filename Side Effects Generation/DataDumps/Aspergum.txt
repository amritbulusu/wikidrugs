==History==
Medicated chewing gum containing aspirin was first sold in the United States in 1924.<ref>Washington, Neena et al. (December 21, 2000) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8jIHhhjiyKcC&pg=PA49&dq=aspergum&sig=pavXLHTQJMtsvLReiWLEh7t9G4k Physiological Pharmaceutics: Barriers to Drug Absorption.]'' Page 49. Publisher: CRC. {{ISBN|0-7484-0562-3}}</ref> In December 1927, [[Frank Dillard|Frank M. Dillard]] and William C. Nalle formed the Dillard-Nalle company and sought U.S. trademark protection for Aspergum.<ref>[http://portal.uspto.gov/external/PA_1_0_V9/OpenServletWindow?serialNumber=71258732&scanDate=2005102686367&DocDesc=Registration+Certificate&docType=ORC&currentPage=1&rowNum=2&rowCount=2&formattedDate=27-Mar-1928 United States Trademark No. 240,417.]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Dillard-Nalle then began selling their Dellard's Aspergum in the [[United States]] in 1928.<ref>Advertisement, ''Appleton Post Crescent'', Wisconsin, October 15, 1930</ref><ref>Sohn, Emily.

Gums could do it all -- thanks to the cheeks"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Section: Health; Page 1.</ref> it was an early example of a [[functional gum]] - chewing gum as a [[drug delivery]] system.

It was significant in the recognition of aspirin's [[thrombosis|antithrombotic]] effect, when [[general practitioner]] [[Lawrence Craven]] reported in 1953 that patients who chewed Aspergum as an analgesic after [[tonsillectomy]] tended to bleed more easily.<ref>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=608223 Aspirin resistance], text MIM 608223, ''Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man''</ref><ref>[http://www.aspirin-foundation.com/uses/cardio/thrombosis.html  Aspirin and Coronary Thrombosis] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711122532/http://www.aspirin-foundation.com/uses/cardio/thrombosis.html |date=July 11, 2007 }}, Aspirin Foundation</ref> As a result of Dr. Craven's discovery through Aspergum in the 1950s, physicians themselves now often take low-dose aspirin to prevent heart attacks and strokes, and emergency rooms routinely give aspirin to patients who they suspect may be experiencing a heart attack.<ref>Graedon, Joe; Graedon, Teresa.

In June 1993, Farmades spa of [[Rome, Italy]] began manufacturing Aspergum Confetti Gommosi Masticabili for sale in Italy.<ref>Farmaci Generici.

People have adopted their own uses for the gum. For example, in her 1997 book ''Streisand'', [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning [[United states|American]] [[singer]] [[Barbra Streisand]] relates a story of how she filled in the gap caused by the removal of two front teeth with Aspergum when she began her career.<ref>Wiegand, David.
