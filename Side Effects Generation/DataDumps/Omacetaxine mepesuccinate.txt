'''Omacetaxine mepesuccinate''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], trade names '''Synribo''' or '''Myelostat''' ), formerly named as '''homoharringtonine''' or '''HHT''', is a pharmaceutical drug substance that is indicated for treatment of [[chronic myeloid leukemia]] (CML). It is a [[natural product]] first discovered in ''[[Cephalotaxus harringtonii]]'', now manufactured by hemi-synthesis.  It was approved by the US FDA in October 2012 for the treatment of adult patients with CML with resistance and/or intolerance to two or more [[tyrosine kinase inhibitors]] (TKIs).<ref name = MSR>{{cite web|title=Synribo (omacetaxine) dosing, indications, interactions, adverse effects, and more|work=Medscape Reference|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=18 February 2014|url=http://reference.medscape.com/drug/synribo-omacetaxine-999786#showall}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Omacetaxine is a protein [[Translation (biology)|translation]] inhibitor. It inhibits protein translation by preventing the initial elongation step of protein synthesis. It interacts with the ribosomal A-site and prevents the correct positioning of amino acid side chains of incoming aminoacyl-tRNAs. Omacetaxine acts only on the initial step of protein translation and does not inhibit protein synthesis from mRNAs that have already commenced translation.<ref>Wetzler M, Segal D.
