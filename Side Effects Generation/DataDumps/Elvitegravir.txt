According to the results of the phase II clinical trial, patients taking once-daily elvitegravir boosted by [[ritonavir]] had greater reductions in [[viral load]] after 24 weeks compared to individuals randomized to receive a ritonavir-boosted [[Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitor]].<ref>Thaczuk, Derek and Carter, Michael.

==Medical uses==
In the United States, elvitegravir can be obtained either as part of the combination pills [[Stribild]] or [[Genvoya]], or as the single pill formulation Vitekta.<ref>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm "FDA Approved Drug Listing"] Accessed March 3, 2017</ref>

Vitekta is [[FDA]] approved to be used for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults who have previous treatment experience with [[antiretroviral therapy]]. It must be used in combination with a protease inhibitor that is coadministered with [[ritonavir]] as well as additional antiretroviral drug(s).<ref name = "PI">[http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=be87c3bc-97bb-49cb-8053-9b0c756a1965#section-1 "Vitekta Package Insert"] Foster City, CA: Gilead Sciences, Inc.; 2014. Accessed November 1, 2014</ref>

==Adverse effects==
The most common side effects of taking elvitegravir are diarrhea (in 7% of patients) and [[nausea]] (4%). Other side effects that occurred in more than 1% of people are headache, tiredness, rashes, and vomiting.<ref name = "PI" /><ref name="AC">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2015|language=German}}</ref>

==Interactions and contraindications==
Elvitegravir is metabolised via the liver enzyme [[CYP3A]]. Substances that induce this enzyme can reduce elvitegravir concentrations in the body, potentially triggering the development of [[Drug resistance|resistant]] virus strains. Consequently, co-administration of strong CYP3A inducers is contraindicated; examples are [[rifampicin]], the anticonvulsants [[carbamazepine]], [[phenobarbital]] and [[phenytoin]], as well as [[St John's wort]].<ref name="AC" />

[[Glucuronidation]] of elvitegravir is facilitated by the enzymes [[UGT1A1]] and [[UGT1A3|3]], resulting in increased blood plasma levels when taken together with strong UGT1A inhibitors such as [[ritonavir]] and other [[HIV protease inhibitor]]s.<ref name="AC" /><ref>{{cite journal|title=In vitro inhibition of UDP glucuronosyltransferases by atazanavir and other HIV protease inhibitors and the relationship of this property to in vivo bilirubin glucuronidation|journal=Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals|volume=33|issue=11|pages=1729–39|pmid=16118329|doi=10.1124/dmd.105.005447|year=2005|author1=Zhang|first1=D|last2=Chando|first2=T. J.|last3=Everett|first3=D. W.|last4=Patten|first4=C. J.|last5=Dehal|first5=S. S.|last6=Humphreys|first6=W. G.}}</ref> (But ritonavir also increases elvitegravir levels by inhibiting CYP3A.)

Furthermore, elvitegravir is a weak to medium inducer of [[CYP1A2]], [[CYP2C19]], [[CYP2C9]], CYP3A, and a number of [[Glucuronosyltransferase|UGT]]s; the clinical relevance of these findings is however unclear.<ref name="AC" />

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===
Elvitegravir inhibits the enzyme [[integrase]] of [[HIV-1]], and of HIV-2 to a lesser extent. The virus needs this enzyme to integrate its genetic code into the host's [[DNA]].<ref name="AC" />

===Pharmacokinetics===
The drug is taken by mouth. When taken together with ritonavir and a meal, it reaches highest blood plasma concentrations after four hours. [[Bioavailability]] is better with fatty meals. In the bloodstream, 98–99% of the substance are bound to [[plasma protein]]s. It is metabolised mainly by CYP3A oxidation, and secondly by UGT1A1 and 3 glucuronidation. Nearly 95% are excreted via the faeces, and the rest via urine. [[Plasma half-life]] when combined with ritonavir is 8.7 to 13.7 hours.<ref name="AC" />
