'''Cypenamine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]]), or '''cypenamine hydrochloride''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]), also known as '''2-phenylcyclopentylamine''', is a [[psychostimulant]] [[drug]] which was developed by a group at the [[William S. Merrell Chemical Company]] in the 1940s.<ref>{{cite patent | country = US | status = patent | number = 2520516 | title = Cyclic Amines and Method of Making Them | inventor = van Zoeren, G.

Cypenamine is currently [[legal]] throughout the entire [[world]], and though its [[chemical structure]] has a vague similarity to certain [[controlled substance|controlled]] stimulants like [[fencamfamine]], it is likely that it is too distant for it to be considered an [[Illegal drug trade|illicit]] [[structural analog|analogue]] under the [[United States]] [[Federal Analogue Act]] of the [[Controlled Substances Act]].

==Chemistry==

===Stereochemistry===
2-Phenylcyclopentan-1-amine is a compound with two [[stereocenter]]s. Thus, the following two [[enantiomer]]ic pairs may exist:

* (1''RS'',2''SR'')-''trans''-2-phenylcyclopentan-1-amine
* (1''RS'',2''RS'')-''cis''-2-phenylcyclopentan-1-amine

The [[racemate]] (±)-''trans''-2-phenylcyclopentan-1-amine [1:1 mixture of  (1''R'',2''S'')-''trans''-2-phenylcyclopentan-1-amine (box, left) and (1''S'',2''R'')-''trans''-2-phenylcyclopentan-1-amine (box, right)] is the active ingredient of cypenamine.<ref name=Gotor/> Furthermore, the [[kinetic resolution]] of (±)-''trans''-2-phenylcyclopentan-1-amine by lipase B from ''Candida antarctica'' may effectivily performed by an aminolysis reaction.<ref name=Gotor>{{cite journal |author1=González-Sabín, J. |author2=Gotor, V. |author3=Rebolledo, F. | title = Kinetic resolution of (±)-trans- und (±)-cis-phenylcyclopentanamine by CALB-catalyzed aminolysis of esters: The key role of the leaving group | journal = Tetrahedron:Asymmetry | year = 2004 | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 481–488 | doi = 10.1016/j.tetasy.2003.11.013 }}</ref>

Racemic ''cis''-2-phenylcyclopentan-1-amine [1:1 mixture of (1''R'',2''R'')-''cis''-2-phenylcyclopentan-1-amine and (1''S'',2''S'')-''cis''-2-phenylcyclopentan-1-amine] has found no pharmacological application.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===Homology===
Cypenamine is a [[homology (chemistry)|homolog]] of [[tranylcypromine]], containing an expanded alicyclic ring that is two [[Methylene bridge|methylene]] units larger than the highly strained/reactive cyclopropane. The cyclohexane homologue has been reported, although the LD<sub>50</sub>s were all less than for plain amphetamine, it was still a functional stimulant.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}
