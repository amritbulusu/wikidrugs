===Heart valve disease===
The distinctive valvular abnormality seen with fenfluramine is a thickening of the leaflet and [[chordae tendineae]]. One mechanism used to explain this phenomenon involves heart valve serotonin receptors, which are thought to help regulate growth. Since fenfluramine and its active metabolite [[norfenfluramine]] stimulate serotonin receptors, this may have led to the valvular abnormalities found in patients using fenfluramine. In particular norfenfluramine is a potent inhibitor of the re-uptake of 5-HT into nerve terminals.<ref name="pmid11489456 ">{{ cite journal |vauthors=Vickers SP, Dourish CT, Kennett GA | title = Evidence that hypophagia induced by d-fenfluramine and d-norfenfluramine in the rat is mediated by 5-HT2C receptors | journal = Neuropharmacology | year = 2001 | volume = 41 | pages = 200–9 | pmid = 11489456 | doi=10.1016/s0028-3908(01)00063-6}}</ref> Fenfluramine and its active metabolite norfenfluramine affect the [[5-HT2B receptor|5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors]], which are plentiful in human cardiac valves. The suggested mechanism by which fenfluramine causes damage is through over or inappropriate stimulation of these receptors leading to inappropriate valve cell division. Supporting this idea is the fact that this valve abnormality has also occurred in patients using other drugs that act on 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors.<ref name="pmid17202450">{{ cite journal | author = Roth, B.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Fenfluramine acts primarily as a [[serotonin releasing agent]].<ref name="pmid12649307" /><ref name="pmid12761331" /> It increases the level of [[serotonin]], a [[neurotransmitter]] that regulates mood, appetite and other functions.<ref name="pmid12649307" /><ref name="pmid12761331" /> Fenfluramine [[releasing agent|causes the release]] of serotonin by disrupting [[synaptic vesicle|vesicular]] storage of the neurotransmitter, and reversing serotonin [[membrane transport protein|transporter]] function.<ref>{{ cite book | authorlink = Eric J. Nestler | author = Nestler, E. J. | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 2001 }}</ref> The drug also acts as a [[norepinephrine releasing agent]] to a lesser extent, particularly via its [[active metabolite]] [[norfenfluramine]].<ref name="pmid12649307" /><ref name="pmid12761331" /> At high concentrations, norfenfluramine, though not fenfluramine, also acts as a [[dopamine releasing agent]], and so fenfluramine may do this at very high doses as well.<ref name="pmid12649307" /><ref name="pmid12761331" /> In addition to monoamine release, while fenfluramine binds only very weakly to the serotonin [[5-HT2 receptor|5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor]]s, norfenfluramine binds to and activates the serotonin [[5-HT2B receptor|5-HT<sub>2B</sub>]] and [[5-HT2C receptor|5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor]]s with high affinity and the serotonin [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor]] with moderate affinity.<ref name="GiovanniMatteo2008">{{cite book|author1=Giuseppe Di Giovanni|author2=Vincenzo Di Matteo|author3=Ennio Esposito|title=Serotonin-dopamine Interaction: Experimental Evidence and Therapeutic Relevance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mPkKtA15KM8C&pg=PA393|year=2008|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-53235-0|pages=393–}}</ref><ref name="pmid10617681">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fitzgerald LW, Burn TC, Brown BS, Patterson JP, Corjay MH, Valentine PA, Sun JH, Link JR, Abbaszade I, Hollis JM, Largent BL, Hartig PR, Hollis GF, Meunier PC, Robichaud AJ, Robertson DW | title = Possible role of valvular serotonin 5-HT(2B) receptors in the cardiopathy associated with fenfluramine | journal = Mol.

==Chemistry==
Fenfluramine is a [[substituted amphetamine]] and is also known as '''3-trifluoromethyl-''N''-ethylamphetamine'''.<ref name="Barceloux2012" /> It is a [[racemic mixture]] of two [[enantiomer]]s, [[dexfenfluramine]] and [[levofenfluramine]].<ref name="Barceloux2012" /> Some [[structural analog|analogue]]s of fenfluramine include [[norfenfluramine]], [[benfluorex]], [[flucetorex]], and [[fludorex]].

==History==
Fenfluramine was developed in the early 1960s and was introduced in [[France]] in 1963.<ref name="Barceloux2012" /> Approximately 50&nbsp;million Europeans were treated with fenfluramine for appetite suppression between 1963 and 1996.<ref name="Barceloux2012" /> Fenfluramine was approved in the [[United States]] in 1973.<ref name="Barceloux2012" /> The combination of fenfluramine and phentermine was proposed in 1984.<ref name="Barceloux2012" /> Approximately 5&nbsp;million people in the United States were given fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine with or without phentermine between 1996 and 1998.<ref name="Barceloux2012" />

In the early 1990s, French researchers reported an association of fenfluramine with primary [[pulmonary hypertension]] and [[dyspnea]] in a small sample of patients.<ref name="Barceloux2012" /> Fenfluramine was withdrawn from the U.S. market in 1997 after reports of [[valvular heart disease|heart valve disease]]<ref name="pmid9271479">{{cite journal |author1=Connolly, H.
