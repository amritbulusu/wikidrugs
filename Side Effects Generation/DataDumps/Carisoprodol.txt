'''Carisoprodol''', marketed under the brand name '''Soma''' among others, is a prescription drug marketed since 1959. It is a centrally acting skeletal [[muscle relaxant]] of the [[carbamate]] class and produces all the effects associated with [[barbiturate]]s. It is a [[prodrug]]<ref>Meda Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Somerset, New Jersey is the U.S. subsidiary of Meda AB of Solna, Sweden {{Cite web |url = http://www.medpointepharma.com/index.html/ |title = Meda Pharmaceuticals Inc. |accessdate = 22 June 2010 }}</ref> and is both [[Structural analog|structurally]] and [[pharmacologically]] related to [[meprobamate]]. The major metabolic pathway of carisoprodol involves its conversion to meprobamate.<ref name="accessdata.fda.gov">{{cite web |title = SOMA® COMPOUND |url = https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/012365s038lbl.pdf |website = accessdata.fda.gov |publisher = Meda Pharmaceuticals Inc. |accessdate = 16 April 2017 |pages = 5–17 |date = October 2009 }}</ref>

In the United States, carisoprodol is a [[Schedule IV (US)|Schedule IV]] controlled substance under the [[Controlled Substances Act of 1970]]. The diversion and abuse of the drug increased in the last decade. It is manufactured and marketed in the U.S. by [[Meda Pharmaceuticals]] and {{asof|2015|lc=y}}, the cost for a typical course of the medication was less than {{USD|25}}.<ref name=Ric2015>{{cite book |last1 = Hamilton |first1 = Richart |title = Tarascon Pocket Pharmacopoeia 2015 Deluxe Lab-Coat Edition |date = 2015 |publisher = Jones & Bartlett Learning |isbn = 978-1-284-05756-0 |page = 1 }}</ref>

== Medical uses ==

== Side effects ==

The usual dose of 350&nbsp;mg is unlikely to engender prominent side effects other than [[somnolence]], and mild to significant [[euphoria]] or [[dysphoria]], but the euphoria is generally short lived. The medication is well tolerated and without adverse effects in the majority of patients for whom it is indicated. In some patients, however, and/or early in therapy, carisoprodol can have the full spectrum of sedative side effects and can impair the patient's ability to operate a firearm, motor vehicles, and other machinery of various types, especially when taken with medications containing alcohol, in which case an alternative medication would be considered. The intensity of the side effects of carisoprodol tends to lessen as therapy continues, as is the case with many other drugs.

The interaction of carisoprodol with essentially all [[opioid]]s, and other centrally acting analgesics, but especially {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} those of the codeine-derived subgroup of the semisynthetic class ([[codeine]], [[ethylmorphine]], [[dihydrocodeine]], [[hydrocodone]], [[oxycodone]], [[nicocodeine]], [[benzylmorphine]], the various acetylated codeine derivatives including  [[acetyldihydrocodeine]], [[dihydroisocodeine]], [[nicodicodeine]] and others) {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} which allows the use of a smaller dose of the opioid to have a given effect, {{citation needed|date=June 2014}} is useful in general and especially where skeletal muscle injury and/or spasm is a large part of the problem. The potentiation effect is also useful in other pain situations and is also especially useful with opioids of the open-chain class, such as [[methadone]], [[levomethadone]], [[ketobemidone]], [[phenadoxone]] and others.  In recreational drug users, deaths have resulted from carelessly combining overdoses of hydrocodone and carisoprodol. Another danger of misuse of carisoprodol and opiates is the potential to [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspirate]] while unconscious.

== Withdrawal ==

Carisoprodol, meprobamate, and related drugs such as [[tybamate]], have the potential to produce physical dependence of the barbiturate type following periods of prolonged use. Withdrawal of the drug after extensive use may require hospitalization in medically compromised patients. In severe cases the withdrawal can mimic the symptoms of [[delerium tremens|alcohol withdrawal]] including the potentially lethal [[status epilepticus]].

Psychological dependence has also been linked to carisoprodol use although this is much less severe than with meprobamate itself (presumably due to the slower onset of effects). Psychological dependence is more common in those who abuse carisoprodol and those who have a history of drug abuse (particularly sedatives and/or alcohol). It may reach clinical significance before physiological tolerance and dependence have occurred and (as with benzodiazepines) has been demonstrated to persist to varying degrees of severity for months or years after discontinuation.

=== Withdrawal treatment ===

Discontinuation of carisoprodol, as with all GABA-ergics, can result in persistent cognitive changes which persist for weeks, months, or – rarely – even years including greatly increased anxiety and depression, [[social withdrawal]], hair-trigger agitation/aggression, chronic [[insomnia]], new or aggravated (often illogical) [[phobias]], reduced IQ, short term and long term memory loss, and dozens of other sequelae.<ref>{{cite journal |title = Persistence of cognitive effects after withdrawal from long-term Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology |author1 = Melinda J Barker |author2 = Kenneth M Greenwood |author3 = Martin Jackson |author4 = Simon F Crowe |url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887617703000969 |doi = 10.1016/S0887-6177(03)00096-9 |volume = 19 |issue = 3 |journal = Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology |pages = 437–454 |pmid = 15033227 |date = April 2004 }}</ref> The effects, severity, and duration appear to be slightly dose-dependent but are mainly determined by the patients pattern of use (taken as prescribed, taken in bulk doses, mixed with other drugs, a combination of the above, etc.), genetic predisposition to drug abuse, and a history of substance abuse all increase the patients risk of persistent discontinuation syndrome symptoms.

Treatment for physical withdrawal generally involves switching the patient to a long-acting benzodiazepine such as [[diazepam]] or [[clonazepam]] then slowly titrating them off the replacement drug completely at a rate which is both reasonably comfortable for the patient but rapid enough for the managing physician to consider the rate of progress acceptable (overly rapid dose reduction greatly increases the risk of patient non-compliance such as the abuse of illicitly obtained alternative sedatives and/or alcohol). [[Psychotherapy]] and [[cognitive behavior therapy]] have demonstrated moderate success in reducing the rebound anxiety which results upon carisoprodol discontinuation but only when combined with regular and active attendance to a substance abuse support group.

Anecdotal reports indicate that routine physical exercise speeds the recovery from dependence, with a long jog/swim/bike ride (etc.) effectively acting as a "rescue medication" for sudden/severe cravings and panic attacks. A wide range of evidence-based therapies (''e.g.'', [[meditation]], [[yoga]], and [[Nutrition and cognition|nutrition]]) as well as alternative medical practices (''e.g.'', [[acupuncture]], [[chiropractic|chiropractory]], and [[martial arts]]) may reduce persistent psychological dependence, but there is insufficient scientific data testing these practices with respect to the treatment of persistent post-withdrawal cravings with Carisprodol.  More research is needed.

Carisoprodol withdrawal can be life-threatening (especially in high dose users and those who attempt to quit "[[cold turkey]]"). A patient should '''always''' contact their doctor prior to attempting to discontinue carisoprodol use so that the physician and the patient can agree on a titration plan which is safe, affordable, comfortable, and effective for the patient in order to protect the patient and maximize program compliance

== Recreational use and abuse ==

Recreational users of carisoprodol usually seek its potentially heavy sedating, relaxant, and [[anxiolytic]] effects.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate = 29 April 2011 |url = http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drugs_concern/carisoprodol.htm |title = DEA Drugs & Chemicals of Concern "Carisoprodol" |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110417095759/http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drugs_concern/carisoprodol.htm |archivedate = 17 April 2011 |df = }}</ref> Also, because of its potentiating effects on [[narcotic]]s, it is often abused in conjunction with many [[opioid]] drugs. Also it is not detected on standard [[drug test]]ing screens. On 26 March 2010 the DEA issued a [[Notice of Hearing]] on proposed rule making in respect to the placement of carisoprodol in schedule IV of the [[Controlled Substances Act]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.pharmcast.com/FederalRegistrar/Yr2010/Mar2010/032210/Carisoprodol032610.htm |title = Archived copy |accessdate = 19 April 2010 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110715074835/http://www.pharmcast.com/FederalRegistrar/Yr2010/Mar2010/032210/Carisoprodol032610.htm |archivedate = 15 July 2011 |df = }}</ref> Carisoprodol is sometimes mixed with [[date rape drug]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |pmc = 2689633 |pmid = 19547737 |doi = 10.3238/arztebl.2009.0341 |volume = 106 |issue = 20 |title = Knock-out drugs: their prevalence, modes of action, and means of detection |date = May 2009 |journal = Dtsch Arztebl Int |pages = 341–7 |vauthors = Madea B, Musshoff F |doi-broken-date = 31 August 2017 }}</ref>

Carisoprodol produces the same enzyme-inducing effects as barbiturates and may be used to potentiate pro-drug opioids, most commonly codeine and hydrocodone, by increasing the amount of pro-drug converted into the active metabolites (morphine and hydromorphone, respectively). This mechanism, in conjunction with the combined euphoria, sedation, and anxiolytic effects of the two drugs makes the practice incredibly dangerous and unintentional overdoses are not uncommon. The combination of hydrocodone and carisoprodol is referred to in some harm-reduction forums as a "Las Vegas cocktail".<ref name="narconon.org">{{cite web |title = Effects of Soma Abuse |url = http://www.narconon.org/drug-abuse/soma-effects.html |website = narconon.org |accessdate = 16 April 2017 }}</ref> Many overdoses have resulted from recreational users combining these drugs to combine their individual effects without being aware of the enzyme-induction induced potentiation.{{mcn|date=July 2015}}

== Overdose ==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}

As with other GABAergic drugs, combination with other GABAergic drugs, including alcohol, as well as with sedatives in general, possess a significant risk to the user in the form of overdose. Overdose symptoms are similar to those of other GABAergics including excessive sedation and unresponsiveness to stimuli, severe [[ataxia]], [[amnesia]], [[confusion]], [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]], [[Drug overdose|intoxication]] and inappropriate (potentially violent) behavior. Severe overdoses may present with [[respiratory depression]] (and subsequent [[pulmonary aspiration]]), [[coma]], and [[death]].

Carisoprodol is not detected on all toxicology tests which may delay diagnosis of overdose. Overdose symptoms in combination with opiates are similar but are distinguished by the presentation of normal or [[miosis|pinpoint pupils]], which are generally unresponsive to light. Carisoprodol (as with its metabolite meprobamate) is particularly dangerous in combination with alcohol. [[Flumazenil]] (the benzodiazepine antidote) is not effective in the management of carisoprodol overdose as carisoprodol acts at the barbiturate binding site. Treatment mirrors that of [[barbiturate overdose]]s and is generally supportive, including the administration of [[mechanical respiration]] and [[pressors]] as implicated (and in rare cases, [[bemegride]]). Total amnesia of the experience is not uncommon following recovery.

== Pharmacokinetics ==

Carisoprodol has a rapid, 30-minute onset of action, with the aforementioned effects lasting about two to six hours. It is metabolized in the liver via the [[cytochrome P450 oxidase]] [[isozyme]] [[CYP2C19]], excreted by the kidneys and has about an eight-hour half-life. A considerable proportion of carisoprodol is metabolized to [[meprobamate]], which is a known drug of abuse and dependence; this could account for the abuse potential of carisoprodol (meprobamate levels reach higher peak plasma levels than carisoprodol itself following administration). Meprobamate is believed to play a significant role in the effects of carisoprodol and meprobamates long half-life results in bioaccumulation following extended periods of carisoprodol administration.

It is slightly [[soluble]] in [[properties of water|water]] and freely soluble in [[ethanol]], [[chloroform]] and [[acetone]]. The drug's solubility is practically independent of [[pH]].

== History ==

On 1 June 1959 several American pharmacologists convened at [[Wayne State University]] in [[Detroit, Michigan]] to discuss a new drug. The drug, originally thought to have [[antiseptic]] properties, was found to have central muscle-relaxing properties.<ref>Miller JG, ed. The pharmacology and clinical usefulness of carisoprodol. Detroit:Wayne State University; 1959.</ref> It had been developed by [[Frank M. Berger]] at [[Wallace Laboratories]] and was named carisoprodol.

Carisoprodol was a modification of [[meprobamate]], intended to have better muscle relaxing properties, less potential for abuse, and less risk of overdose.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Berger |first1 = F |last2 = Kletzkin |first2 = M |last3 = Ludwig |first3 = B |last4 = Margolin |first4 = S |year = 1959 |title = The history, chemistry, and pharmacology of carisoprodol |url =  |journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume = 86 |issue =  |pages = 90–107 |doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1960.tb42792.x |pmid = 13799302 }}</ref> The substitution of one [[hydrogen]] [[atom]] with an [[isopropyl]] group on one of the carbamyl [[nitrogen]]s was intended to yield a [[molecule]] with new pharmacological properties.
