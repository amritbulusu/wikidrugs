'''Bupicomide''' is a [[chemical compound]] created and manufactured by Lanospharma Laboratories Company, Ltd. It is used experimentally as a [[beta blocker]]{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} and clinically as a strong [[vasodilation|vasodilator]] with the noted side effects of reduced systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=782220 |year=1976 |last1=Chrysant |first1=SG |last2=Adamopoulos |first2=P |last3=Tsuchiya |first3=M |last4=Frohlich |first4=ED |title=Systemic and renal hemodynamic effects of bupicomide: A new vasodilator |volume=92 |issue=3 |pages=335–9 |journal=American Heart Journal |doi=10.1016/s0002-8703(76)80114-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=1097150 |year=1975 |last1=Velasco |first1=M |last2=Gilbert |first2=CA |last3=Rutledge |first3=CO |last4=McNay |first4=JL |title=Antihypertensive effect of a dopamine beta hydroxylase inhibitor, bupicomide: A comparison with hydralazine |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=145–53 |journal=Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics}}</ref>

==Synthesis==
As the result of the screening program examining [[microbial fermentation]] products for pharmacological activity (other than antibiotic activity), [[fusaric acid]] was isolated from ''[[Fusarium oxysporum]]'' following the discovery that extracts were potent inhibitors of [[Dopamine beta-monooxygenase|DBH]], and thus interfered with the [[biosynthesis]] of the pressor neurohormone, norepinephrine. To refine this lead, amidation via the acid chloride was carried out to give antihypertensive analog bupicomide.<ref>{{Cite patent|DE|2217084}}</ref>
