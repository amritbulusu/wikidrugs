'''Methitural''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]; '''Neraval''', '''Thiogenal'''), or '''methitural sodium''', also known as '''methioturiate''', is a [[barbiturate]] [[chemical derivative|derivative]] which was marketed in the 1950s in [[Europe]] (in [[Germany]] and [[Italy]]) as an ultra-short-acting [[intravenous]] [[anesthetic]].<ref name="Macdonald1997">{{cite book | author = F..

==Synthesis==
[[File:Methitural synthesis.svg|thumb|center|500px|Methitural synthesis: Zima, Von Werder, {{US patent|2802827}} (1957 to E. Merck).]]
A somewhat more complex side chain is incorporated by alkylation of the carbanion of the substituted [[cyanoacetate]] ('''1''') with 2-chloroethylmethyl sulfide ('''2'''). Condensation of the resulting cyanoester ('''3''') with thiourea followed by hydrolysis of the resulting imine affords methitural.
