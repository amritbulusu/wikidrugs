'''Dipyridamole''' (trademarked as '''Persantine''' and others) is a [[medication]] that inhibits [[thrombus|blood clot]] formation<ref>{{DorlandsDict|three/000030395|Dipyridamole}}</ref> when given chronically and causes [[vasodilation|blood vessel dilation]] when given at high doses over a short time.

==Mechanism and effects==
* Dipyridamole inhibits the [[phosphodiesterase]] enzymes that normally break down [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] (increasing cellular cAMP levels and blocking the [[platelet aggregation]] response<ref name=Brown2015>{{cite journal|vauthors=Brown DG, Wilkerson EC, Love WE | title=A review of traditional and novel oral anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy for dermatologists and dermatologic surgeons|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology|volume=72|issue=3|pages=524–34|date=March 2015|pmid=25486915|doi= 10.1016/j.jaad.2014.10.027}}</ref>  to [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]]) and/or [[cyclic guanosine monophosphate|cGMP]].
* It inhibits the cellular reuptake of [[adenosine]] into [[platelets]], [[red blood cell]]s, and [[endothelial cell]]s leading to increased extracellular concentrations of adenosine.

==Medical uses==
* Dipyridamole is used to dilate blood vessels in people with [[peripheral arterial disease]] and [[coronary artery disease]]<ref name=Brown2015/>
* Dipyridamole has been shown to lower [[pulmonary hypertension]] without significant drop of systemic [[blood pressure]]
* It inhibits formation of pro-inflammatory cytokines ([[MCP-1]], [[MMP-9]]) in vitro and results in reduction of hsCRP in patients.
* It inhibits proliferation of smooth muscle cells in vivo and modestly increases unassisted patency of synthetic arteriovenous hemodialysis grafts.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Dixon BS, Beck GJ, Vazquez MA | year = 2009 | title = Effect of dipyridamole plus aspirin on hemodialysis graft patency | url = | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 360 | issue = 21| pages = 2191–2201 | doi=10.1056/nejmoa0805840|display-authors=etal}}</ref>
* It increases the release of [[Tissue plasminogen activator|t-PA]] from brain microvascular endothelial cells
* It results in an increase of [[13-HODE]] and decrease of [[12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid|12-HETE]] in the subendothelial matrix (SEM) and reduced thrombogenicity of the SEM.
* Pretreatment it reduced reperfusion injury in volunteers.
* It has been shown to increase myocardial perfusion and left ventricular function in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.
* It results in a reduction of the number of [[Thrombin receptor|thrombin]] and [[CD31|PECAM-1]] receptors on platelets in stroke patients.
* [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] impairs platelet aggregation and also causes [[arteriole|arteriolar]] [[smooth muscle]] relaxation. Chronic therapy did not show significant drop of systemic blood pressure.
* It inhibits the replication of [[mengovirus]] RNA.<ref>Dipyridamole in the laboratory: {{cite web  | last = Fata-Hartley   | first = Cori L.   |author2=Ann C. Palmenberg   | title = Dipyridamole reversibly inhibits mengovirus RNA replication

* It can be used for myocardial stress testing as an alternative to exercise-induced stress methods such as treadmills.

===Use in individuals with a history of stroke===
A combination of dipyridamole and [[aspirin]] ([[acetylsalicylic acid/dipyridamole]]) is [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]-approved for the secondary prevention of [[stroke]] and has a bleeding risk equal to that of aspirin use alone.<ref name=Brown2015/> Dipyridamole absorption is [[pH]]-dependent and concomitant treatment with gastric acid suppressors (such as a [[proton pump inhibitor]]) will inhibit the absorption of liquid and plain tablets.<ref>Russell TL, Berardi RR, Barnett JL, O’Sullivan TL, Wagner JG, Dressman JB. pH-related changes in the absorption of "dipyridamole"  in the elderly. Pharm Res (1994) 11 136–43.</ref><ref>Derendorf H, VanderMaelen CP, Brickl R-S, MacGregor TR, Eisert W. "Dipyridamole" bioavailability in subjects with reduced gastric acidity. J Clin Pharmacol (2005) 45, 845–50.</ref> Modified release preparations are buffered and absorption is not affected.<ref>http://emc.medicines.org.uk/medicine/304/SPC/Persantin+Retard+200mg/#EXCIPIENTS</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Stockley |first=Ivan |year=2009 |title='''Stockley’s Drug Interactions''' |publisher = The Pharmaceutical Press|isbn=0-85369-424-9}}</ref>

However, it is not licensed as monotherapy for stroke prophylaxis, although a [[Cochrane Review]] suggested that dipyridamole may reduce the risk of further vascular events in patients presenting after cerebral [[ischemia]].<ref name="Dipyridamole for preventing stroke and other vascular events in patients with vascular disease">{{cite journal |vauthors=De Schryver EL, Algra A, van Gijn J |editor1-last=Algra |editor1-first=Ale |title=Dipyridamole for preventing stroke and other vascular events in patients with vascular disease. |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=2 |year=2007 |pages=CD001820 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001820.pub3 |url=http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab001820.html |pmid=17636684}}</ref>

A triple therapy of [[aspirin]], [[clopidogrel]], and dipyridamole has been investigated, but this combination led to an increase in adverse bleeding events.<ref name="pmid18682741">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Sprigg N, Gray LJ, England T |display-authors=etal |editor1-last=Berger |editor1-first=Jeffrey S. |title=A randomised controlled trial of triple antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel and dipyridamole) in the secondary prevention of stroke: safety, tolerability and feasibility |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=3 |issue=8 |pages=e2852 |year=2008 |pmid=18682741 |pmc=2481397 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0002852 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0002852}}</ref>

* Vasodilation occurs in healthy arteries, whereas [[stenosis|stenosed]] arteries remain narrowed.  This creates a "steal" phenomenon where the coronary blood supply will increase to the dilated healthy vessels compared to the stenosed arteries which can then be detected by clinical symptoms of chest pain, [[electrocardiogram]] and [[echocardiography]] when it causes ischemia.
* Flow heterogeneity (a necessary precursor to ischemia) can be detected with [[gamma camera]]s and [[SPECT]] using nuclear imaging agents such as [[Thallium]]-201, [[Technetium-99m|Tc99m]]-[[Tetrofosmin]] and [[Technetium-99m|Tc99m]]-[[Sestamibi]]. However, relative differences in perfusion do not necessarily imply any absolute decrease in blood supply in the tissue supplied by a stenosed artery.

===Other uses===
Dipyridamole also has non-medicinal uses in a laboratory context, such as the inhibition of [[cardiovirus]] growth in [[cell culture]].

==Overdose==

Dipyridamole [[overdose]] can be treated with [[aminophylline]]<ref name="Aggrenox PI" />{{rp|6}} which reverses its [[hemodynamics|dilating effect on the blood vessels]].  Symptomatic treatment is recommended, possibly including a vasopressor drug. Gastric lavage should be considered. Administration of xanthine derivatives (e.g., aminophylline) may reverse the hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole overdose. Since dipyridamole is highly protein bound, [[hemodialysis|dialysis]] is not likely to be of benefit.
