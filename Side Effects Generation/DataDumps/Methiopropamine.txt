'''Methiopropamine''' ('''MPA''') is a [[thiophene]] ring-based [[structural analog]] of [[methamphetamine]] originally reported in 1942.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/ja01255a001 |date=March 1942 |last1=Blicke |first1=F.

==Pharmacology==
Methiopropamine functions as a selective [[norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor]] that is approximately 1.85 times more selective for norepinephrine than dopamine. It is approximately one third as potent as [[dextroamphetamine]] as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and one fifth as much as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It displays negligible activity as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor.<ref>{{cite journal | PMC=3582025 | first1=L. | first2=S. | first4=V. | last1=Iversen | title=Neurochemical profiles of some novel psychoactive substances | last2=Gibbons | last3=Treble | first3=R. | last4=Setola | last5=Huang | first5=X.

==Metabolism==

[[File:Methiopropamine metabolism colored.png|thumb|275px|Methiopropamine metabolism is somewhat similar to [[methamphetamine]]. [[Hydroxylation]], [[demethylation]] and [[deamination]] are in common. Formation of [[thiophene S-oxide|thiophene ''S''-oxide]] is different, as is the end product which will probably be ([[Substitution reaction|substituted]]) [[thiophene-2-carboxylic acid]]. It is then excreted in urine. Compounds on red are inactive.]]

For ''N''-alkyl amphetamines, [[deamination]] and ''N''-[[dealkylation]] are the major elimination pathways and [[renal]] [[excretion]] is a minor one.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0009-8981(71)90187-2 |title=Deuterium isotope effects in the metabolism of n-alkylsubstituted amphetamines in man |date=September 1971 |last1=Vree |first1=T.B. |last2=Gorgels |first2=J.P.M.C. |last3=Muskens |first3=A.Th.J.M. |last4=Van Rossum |first4=J.M. |journal=Clinica Chimica Acta |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=333–44 |pmid=5113570}}</ref>

[[Thiophene-2-carboxylic acid]] is the final major metabolic product. It is very [[hydrophilic]] and is excreted in urine. Methiopropamine and especially [[thiopropamine]] are also excreted [[renal]]ly, unchanged.

==Synthesis==
There is a four-step synthesis of methiopropamine. It begins with (thiophen-2-yl)magnesium bromide, which is reacted with [[propylene oxide]], yielding 1-(thiophen-2-yl)-2-hydroxypropane which is reacted with [[phosphorus tribromide]], yielding 1-(thiophen-2-yl)-2-bromopropane which is finally reacted with [[methylamine]], yielding 1-(thiophen-2-yl)-2-methylaminopropane.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.justice.gov/dea/pr/microgram-journals/2011/mj8-2_53-57.pdf |title=Methiopropamine: An Analytical Profile |first1=John F. |last1=Casale |first2=Patrick A. |last2=Hays |year=2011 |journal=Microgram Journal |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=53–7}}</ref>

===Germany===
Methiopropamine is explicitly illegal in Germany.

===United Kingdom===
Following the ban on [[ethylphenidate]] authorities noticed an increase in methiopropamine use by injecting users.

===United States===
Methiopropamine is not scheduled at the federal level in the [[United States]].<ref name="PART 1308 — SCHEDULES OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES - 1308.11 Schedule I">[http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1308/1308_11.htm 21 CFR — SCHEDULES OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES §1308.11 Schedule I.]</ref>

====Florida====
Methiopropamine is a Schedule I [[controlled substance]] in the state of [[Florida]] making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess in Florida.<ref name="Florida Statutes - Chapter 893 - DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION AND CONTROL">[http://leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0800-0899/0893/0893.html Florida Statutes - Chapter 893 - DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION AND CONTROL]</ref>

'''Tasmania (Australia)'''

Methiopropamine is a "controlled substance" and therefore an "illegal drug" to import, possess or sell/traffic in without express authority of the relevant government agency. [18]
