==Medical uses==
Pyrimethamine is typically given with a [[sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]] and [[folinic acid]].<ref name="AMH">{{cite book|title=Australian Medicines Handbook|publisher=The Australian Medicines Handbook Unit Trust|year=2013|isbn=978-0-9805790-9-3|edition=2013|editor=Rossi, S|place=Adelaide}}</ref>

It is used for the treatment of [[toxoplasmosis]], [[actinomycosis]], and [[isosporiasis]], and for the treatment and prevention of ''[[Pneumocystis jirovecii]]'' pneumonia.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Toxoplasmosis===
Pyrimethamine is also used in combination with [[sulfadiazine]] to treat active [[toxoplasmosis]]. The two drugs bind the same enzymatic targets as the drugs [[trimethoprim]] and [[sulfamethoxazole]] - dihydrofolate reductase and dihydropteroate synthase, respectively.

Pyrimethamine has also been used in several trials to treat [[toxoplasmic chorioretinitis|retinochoroiditis]].<ref name="Pradhan">{{cite journal |vauthors=Pradhan E, Bhandari S, Gilbert RE, Stanford M |title= Antibiotics versus no treatment for toxoplasma retinochoroiditis |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume=5 |pages= CD002218 |date=2016 |pmid= 27198629 |doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD002218.pub2}}</ref>

===Malaria===
It is primarily active against ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'', but also against ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]''.<ref name = MD>{{cite web|title=Pyrimethamine|work=Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference|publisher=Pharmaceutical Press|accessdate=12 April 2014|date=13 December 2013|url=http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/martindale/current/1389-y.htm|editor=Brayfield, A}}</ref> Due to the emergence of pyrimethamine-resistant strains of ''P. falciparum'', pyrimethamine alone is seldom used now. In combination with a long-acting sulfonamide such as [[sulfadiazine]], it was widely used, such as in [[Fansidar]], though resistance to this combination is increasing.<ref name = MD/>

==Contraindications==
Pyrimethamine is contraindicated in people with [[Folate deficiency|folate-deficiency anaemia]]<ref name = AMH/>

==Side effects==
When higher doses are used, as in the treatment of toxoplasmosis, pyrimethamine can cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, [[glossitis]], anorexia, and diarrhea.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/sfx/daraprim-side-effects.html|title=Daraprim Side Effects in Detail - Drugs.com|website=www.drugs.com|access-date=2016-11-07|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108052945/https://www.drugs.com/sfx/daraprim-side-effects.html|archivedate=2016-11-08|df=}}</ref><ref name=":4" /> A rash, which can be indicative of a hypersensitivity reaction, is also seen, particularly in combination with sulfonamides.<ref name=":4" /> Central nervous system effects include ataxia, tremors, and seizures.<ref name=":2" /> Hematologic side effects such as [[thrombocytopenia]], [[leukopenia]], and anemia can also occur.<ref name=":2" />

==Interactions==
Other antifolate agents such as [[methotrexate]] and [[trimethoprim]] may potentiate the antifolate actions of pyrimethamine, leading to potential folate deficiency, anaemia, and other [[blood dyscrasia]]s.<ref name = AMH/>

==Mechanism of action==
Pyrimethamine interferes with the regeneration of [[tetrahydrofolic acid]] from [[dihydrofolate]] by competitively inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase.<ref name=TGA>{{cite web|title=PRODUCT INFORMATION DARAPRIM TABLETS|work=TGA eBusiness Services|publisher=Aspen Pharmacare Australia Pty Ltd|date=5 December 2011|accessdate=12 April 2014|url=https://www.ebs.tga.gov.au/ebs/picmi/picmirepository.nsf/pdf?OpenAgent&id=CP-2013-PI-01016-1|page=1|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005203017/https://www.ebs.tga.gov.au/ebs/picmi/picmirepository.nsf/pdf?OpenAgent&id=CP-2013-PI-01016-1|archivedate=5 October 2016|df=}}</ref> Tetrahydrofolic acid is essential for [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] synthesis in many species, including protozoa.<ref name = TGA/> Pyrimethamine has also been found to reduce the expression of [[SOD1]], a key protein involved in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Limpert|first=AS|author2=Mattmann, ME|author3=Cosford, ND|title=Recent progress in the discovery of small molecules for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).|journal=Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry|date=2013|volume=9|pages=717–32|doi=10.3762/bjoc.9.82|pmid=23766784|url=http://www.beilstein-journals.org/bjoc/content/pdf/1860-5397-9-82.pdf|format=PDF|pmc=3678841|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413140738/http://www.beilstein-journals.org/bjoc/content/pdf/1860-5397-9-82.pdf|archivedate=2014-04-13|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Lange|first=DJ|author2=Andersen, PM |author3=Remanan, R |author4=Marklund, S |author5= Benjamin, D |title=Pyrimethamine decreases levels of SOD1 in leukocytes and cerebrospinal fluid of ALS patients: a phase I pilot study.|journal=Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis & Frontotemporal Degeneration|date=April 2013|volume=14|issue=3|pages=199–204|doi=10.3109/17482968.2012.724074|pmid=22985433}}</ref>

===Other medications===
Pyrimethamine is typically given with folinic acid and sulfadiazine.
* [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|Sulfonamide]]s (e.g. [[sulfadiazine]]) inhibit [[dihydropteroate synthase|dihydropteroate synthetase]], an enzyme that participates in folic acid synthesis from [[para-aminobenzoic acid]].  Hence, sulfonamides work synergistically with pyrimethamine by blocking a different enzyme needed for folic acid synthesis.
* [[Folinic acid]] (leucovorin) is a folic acid derivative converted to [[tetrahydrofolate]], the primary active form of folic acid, ''in vivo'', without relying on dihydrofolate reductase. Folinic acid reduces side effects related to [[folate deficiency]] in the patient.

===Mechanism of resistance===
Resistance to pyrimethamine is widespread.  Mutations in the malarial gene for dihydrofolate reductase may reduce its effectiveness.<ref name="Gatton2004">{{Cite journal | author= Gatton M.L.| year= 2004 | title= Evolution of resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in ''Plasmodium falciparum'' | journal= Antimicrob Agents Chemother | volume= 48 | issue = 6 | pages = 2116&ndash;23 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.48.6.2116-2123.2004 | pmid=15155209 | pmc= 415611 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>  These mutations decrease the binding affinity between pyrimethamine and dihydrofolate reductase via loss of [[hydrogen bonds]] and [[steric]] interactions.<ref name="Sirichaiwat2004">{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Sirichaiwat C, etal | year= 2004 | title= Target guided synthesis of 5-benzyl-2,4-diamonopyrimidines: their antimalarial activities and binding affinities to wild type and mutant dihydrofolate reductases from ''Plasmodium falciparum'' | journal= J Med Chem | volume= 47 | issue = 2 | pages = 345&ndash;54 | doi = 10.1021/jm0303352 | pmid=14711307 }}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Pyrimethamine traditional synthesis.png|thumb|Synthesis of pyrimethamine typically begins with ''p''-chlorophenylacetonitrile, which undergoes a [[condensation reaction]] with [[ethyl propionate]] ester; the product of this then reacts with [[diazomethane]] to form an [[enol]] [[ether]], which reacts with free [[guanidine]] in a second condensation reaction.]]
