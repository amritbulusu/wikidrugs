==History and use==
The chemical was originally synthesised in 1825 by [[Michael Faraday|Faraday]]. It is named after the Dutch chemist Teunis van der Linden (1884–1965), the first to isolate and describe γ-hexachlorcyclohexane in 1912. Its pesticidal action was discovered only in 1942, after which lindane production, by [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] Ltd (ICI), and use started up in the United Kingdom. It has been used to treat food crops and forestry products, as a [[seed treatment]], a soil treatment, and to treat livestock and pets. It has also been used as pharmaceutical treatment for lice and scabies, formulated as a [[shampoo]] or lotion.<ref name="Commission">Commission for Environmental Cooperation.

The Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee of the [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]] considers the use of lindane in agriculture as largely redundant, with other, less toxic and less persistent pesticides.  In the case of pharmaceutical use, the committee noted, "alternatives for pharmaceutical uses have often failed for scabies and lice treatment and the number of available alternative products for this use is scarce. For this particular case, a reasonable alternative would be to use lindane as a second-line treatment when other treatments fail, while potential new treatments are assessed."<ref name="r16"/>

==Human health effects==
The EPA and WHO both classify lindane as "moderately" acutely toxic. It has an oral {{LD50}} of 88&nbsp;mg/kg in rats and a dermal LD<sub>50</sub> of 1000&nbsp;mg/kg. Most of the adverse human health effects reported for lindane have been related to agricultural uses and chronic, occupational exposure of seed-treatment workers.<ref name="r16">Persistent Organic Pollutant Review Committee (POPRC).

===Cancer risk===
Based primarily on evidence from animal studies, most evaluations of lindane have concluded that it may possibly cause cancer. In 2015, the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]]  classified lindane as a known human carcinogen,<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2015/pdfs/pr236_E.pdf |title=IARC Monographs evaluate DDT, lindane, and 2,4-D |language= |author=The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) |date=23 June 2015 |accessdate=2015-11-19 }}</ref><ref>http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045%2815%2900081-9/fulltext</ref> and in 2001 the EPA concluded there was "suggestive evidence of carcinogenicity, but not sufficient to assess human carcinogenic potential."<ref name="EPACA" /> The [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] determined that all isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane, including lindane, "may reasonably be anticipated to cause cancer in humans,"<ref name="Agency"/> and in 1999, the EPA characterized the evidence carcinogenicity for lindane as "suggestive ... of carcinogenicity, but not sufficient to assess human carcinogenic potential."<ref name="EPARED"/> Lindane and its isomers have also been on California's [[Proposition 65]] list of known carcinogens since 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oehha.ca.gov/prop65/prop65_list/files/P65single061110.pdf|title=CHEMICALS KNOWN TO THE STATE TO CAUSE CANCER OR REPRODUCTIVE TOXICITY|last=STATE OF CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT|date=June 11, 2010|accessdate=23 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008225026/http://www.oehha.ca.gov/prop65/prop65_list/files/P65single061110.pdf|archivedate=8 October 2010|df=}}</ref> In contrast, the [[World Health Organization]] concluded in 2004 that "lindane is not likely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans."<ref name="r19">World Health Organization (WHO).

===Adverse reactions to lindane===
A variety of adverse reactions to lindane pharmaceuticals have been reported, ranging from skin irritation to [[seizure]]s, and, in rare instances, death. The most common side effects are burning sensations, itching, dryness, and rash.<ref name="QandA"/> While serious effects are rare and have most often resulted from misuse, adverse reactions have occurred when used properly.<ref name="AssessmentMemo"/><ref name="LotionPrescribe"/><ref name="ShampooPrescribe"/><ref name="Postmarketing">U.S. FDA. Lindane Post Marketing Safety Review. Posted 2003. http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/infopage/lindane/lindaneaeredacted.pdf</ref> The FDA, therefore, requires a so-called [[black box warning]] on lindane products, which explains the risks of lindane products and their proper use.<ref name="QandA">U.S. FDA Centers for Drug Evaluation and Research.

The black box warning emphasizes that lindane should not be used on premature infants and individuals with known uncontrolled seizure disorders, and should be used with caution in infants, children, the elderly, and individuals with other skin conditions (e.g., [[dermatitis]], [[psoriasis]]) and people who weigh less than 110&nbsp;lbs (50&nbsp;kg), as they may be at risk of serious neurotoxicity.<ref name="LotionPrescribe">Lindane lotion, USP, 1% prescribing information.

==Environmental contamination==
Lindane is a [[persistent organic pollutant]]: it is relatively long-lived in the environment, it is transported long distances by natural processes like [[global distillation]], and it can [[bioaccumulate]] in [[food chain]]s, though it is rapidly eliminated when exposure is discontinued.<ref name="r16"/>

The production and agricultural use of lindane are the primary causes of environmental contamination,<ref name="r23">U.S. EPA. Assessment of lindane and other hexachlorocyclohexane isomers. February 8, 2006</ref> and levels of lindane in the environment have been decreasing in the U.S., consistent with decreasing agricultural usage patterns.<ref name="r24">United Nations Environment Programme.

When lindane is used in agriculture, an estimated 12–30% of it volatilizes into the atmosphere, where it is subject to [[global distillation|long-range transport]] and can be deposited by rainfall. Lindane in soil can leach to surface and even ground water, and can bioaccumulate in the food chain.<ref name="EPAREDADD"/> However, biotransformation and elimination are relatively rapid when exposure is discontinued.<ref name="Commission" /> Most exposure of the general population to lindane has resulted from agricultural uses and the intake of foods, such as produce, meats, and milk, produced from treated agricultural commodities. Human exposure has decreased significantly since the cancellation of agricultural uses in 2006. Even so, the CDC published in 2005 its Third National Report on Human Exposures to Environmental Chemicals, which found no detectable amounts of lindane in human blood taken from a random sampling of about 5,000 people in the US as part of the NHANES study (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey at: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/about_nhanes.htm ).<ref name="CDCReport3">US CDC. Third National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals. 2005. Available at: [https://www.cdc.gov/ExposureReport/pdf/thirdreport.pdf https://www.cdc.gov/ExposureReport/pdf/thirdreport.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401141153/http://www.cdc.gov/exposurereport/pdf/thirdreport.pdf |date=2007-04-01 }}.</ref> The lack of detection of lindane in this large human "biomonitoring" study likely reflects the increasingly limited agricultural uses of lindane over the last two decades.  The cancellation of agricultural uses in the United States will further reduce the amount of lindane introduced into the environment by more than 99%.<ref name="Commission" /><ref name="EPAREDADD" />

Over time, lindane is broken down in soil, sediment, and water into less harmful substances by algae, fungi, and bacteria; however, the process is relatively slow and dependent on ambient environmental conditions.<ref name="Agency"/> Lindane residues in honey and beeswax are reported to be the highest of any historical or current pesticide and to continue to pose a threat to honeybee health.<ref name="honey">{{cite journal|last1=Drummond|first1=J|last2=Williamson|first2=S M|last3=Fitchett|first3=A E|title=Spontaneous honeybee behaviour is altered by persistent organic pollutants|journal=Ecotoxicology|date=2016|doi=10.1007/s10646-016-1749-0|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10646-016-1749-0|accessdate=28 December 2016}}</ref> The ecological impact of lindane's environmental persistence continues to be debated.

The US EPA determined in 2002 that the agency does not believe that lindane contaminates drinking water in excess of levels considered safe.<ref name="Agency"/> [[U.S. Geological Survey]] teams concluded the same in 1999 and 2000.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kolpin DW, Furlong ET, Meyer MT, etal | year = 2002 | title = Pharmaceuticals, hormones, and other organic wastewater contaminants in U.S. streams, 1999–2000: A national reconnaissance | url = | journal = Environ Sci Technol | volume = 36 | issue = 6| pages = 1202–1211 | doi=10.1021/es011055j}}</ref> With regard to lindane medications, the EPA conducted "down-the-drain" estimates of the amount of lindane reaching public water supplies and concluded that lindane levels from pharmaceutical sources were "extremely low" and not of concern.<ref name="EPARED"/>

Note that the EPA has set the maximum contaminant level or "MCL" for lindane allowed in public water supplies and considered safe for drinking at 200 parts per trillion (ppt).<ref name="EPAReview03">U.S. EPA. Announcement of completion of EPA's review of existing drinking water standards. Federal Register. 68(138): July 18, 2003.</ref> By comparison, the state of California imposes a lower MCL for lindane of 19 ppt.<ref name="CAOutcomes" /> However, the California standard is based on a dated 1988 national water criterion that was subsequently revised by the EPA in 2003 to 980 ppt.<ref name="EPACA" /><ref name="EPAReview03" /><ref name="CAGoal">California Public Health Goal for Lindane in Drinking Water.

===Isomers===
Lindane is the gamma isomer of [[hexachlorocyclohexane]] ("γ-HCH"). In addition to the issue of lindane pollution, some concerns are related to the other isomers of HCH, namely [[alpha-HCH]] and [[beta-HCH]], which are notably more toxic than lindane, lack its insecticidal properties, and are byproducts of lindane production.<ref name="Agency" /> In the 1940s and 1950s, lindane producers stockpiled these isomers in open heaps, which led to ground and water contamination. The International HCH and Pesticide Forum has since been established to bring together experts to address the clean-up and containment of these sites.<ref name="IHPALegacy" />{{Dead link|date=July 2009}} Modern manufacturing standards for lindane involve the treatment and conversion of waste isomers to less toxic industrial chemicals, a process known as "[[cracking (chemistry)|cracking]]".<ref name="Agency" /><ref name="IHPALegacy" /> Today, only a few production plants remain active worldwide to accommodate public-health uses of lindane and declining agricultural needs.<ref name="Commission" /> Lindane has not been manufactured in the U.S. since the mid-1970s, but continues to be imported.
