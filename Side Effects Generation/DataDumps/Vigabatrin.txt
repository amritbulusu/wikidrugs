'''Vigabatrin''', brand name '''Sabril''', is an [[anticonvulsant|antiepileptic drug]] that inhibits the [[catabolism|breakdown]] of [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|γ-aminobutyric acid]] (GABA) by acting as a [[suicide inhibitor]] of the [[enzyme]] [[GABA transaminase]] (GABA-T). It is also known as '''γ-vinyl-GABA''', and is a [[structural analogue]] of GABA, but does not bind to [[GABA receptor]]s.<ref name=what_is_vigabatrin>Long, Phillip W.

==Medical uses==

===Epilepsy===
In Canada, vigabatrin is approved for use as an adjunctive treatment (with other drugs) in treatment resistant [[epilepsy]], [[complex partial seizure]]s, [[seizures|secondary generalized seizures]], and for monotherapy use in [[infantile spasm]]s in [[West syndrome]].<ref name=what_is_vigabatrin/>

As of 2003, vigabatrin is approved in Mexico for the treatment of epilepsy that is not satisfactorily controlled by conventional therapy (adjunctive or monotherapy) or in recently diagnosed patients who have not tried other agents (monotherapy).<ref name=mexicanuses>[http://www.facmed.unam.mx/bmnd/plm/mex/productos/10130.htm DEF MEXICO: SABRIL] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050914050706/http://www.facmed.unam.mx/bmnd/plm/mex/productos/10130.htm |date=September 14, 2005 }} ''Diccionario de Especialdades Farmaceuticas.'' Edicion 49, 2003.</ref>

Vigabatrin is also indicated for monotherapy use in secondarily generalized [[tonic-clonic seizure]]s, [[seizures|partial seizure]]s, and in infantile spasms due to West syndrome.<ref name=mexicanuses/>

On August 21, 2009, Lundbeck announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had granted two New Drug Application approvals for vigabatrin. The drug is indicated as monotherapy for pediatric patients one month to two years of age with [[infantile spasms]] for whom  the potential benefits outweigh the potential risk of vision loss, and as adjunctive (add-on) therapy for adult patients with refractory complex partial seizures (CPS) who have inadequately responded to several alternative treatments and for whom the potential benefits outweigh the risk of vision loss.

In 1994, Feucht and Brantner-Inthaler reported that vigabatrin reduced seizures by 50-100% in 85% of children with [[Lennox-Gastaut syndrome]] who had poor results with [[sodium valproate]].<ref name=lennoxgastaut>{{cite journal |vauthors=Feucht M, Brantner-Inthaler S | title=Gamma-vinyl-GABA (vigabatrin) in the therapy of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: an open study | journal=Epilepsia | volume=35 | issue=5 | year=1994 | pages=993&ndash;8 | pmid=7925171 | url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1528-1157.1994.tb02544.x| format=PDF| accessdate=2006-05-25 | doi=10.1111/j.1528-1157.1994.tb02544.x}}</ref>

===Others===
Vigabatrin reduced [[cholecystokinin tetrapeptide]]-induced symptoms of [[panic disorder]], in addition to elevated [[cortisol]] and [[ACTH]] levels, in healthy volunteers.<ref name=vigabatrinpanic>{{cite journal |vauthors=Zwanzger P, Baghai TC, Schuele C, Strohle A, Padberg F, Kathmann N, Schwarz M, Moller HJ, Rupprecht R | title=Vigabatrin decreases cholecystokinin-tetrapeptide (CCK-4) induced panic in healthy volunteers | journal=Neuropsychopharmacology | volume=25 | issue=5 | year=2001 | pages=699&ndash;703 | pmid=11682253 | doi=10.1016/S0893-133X(01)00266-4}}</ref>

Vigabatrin is also used to treat seizures in [[succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency]] (SSADHD), which is an inborn GABA metabolism defect that causes [[intellectual disability]], [[hypotonia]], [[seizure]]s, [[Apraxia|speech disturbance]], and [[ataxia]] through the accumulation of γ-Hydroxybutyric acid ([[gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]]). Vigabatrin helps lower GHB levels through GABA transaminase inhibition. However, this is in the brain only; it has no effect on peripheral GABA transaminase, so the GHB keeps building up and eventually reaches the brain.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=gene&part=ssadh |title=Succinic Semialdehyde Dehydrogenase Deficiency |first=Phillip L |last=Pearl |author2=Robbins, Emily |author3=Capp, Philip K |author4=Gasior, Maciej |author5= Gibson, K Michael  |date=May 5, 2004 |work=GeneReviews |publisher=University of Washington |location=Seattle, Washington |accessdate=9-6-2010 |quote= |ref= }}</ref>

Visual field defects had been reported as early as 1997 by Tom Eke and others, in the UK. Some authors, including Comaish et al. believe that visual field loss and electrophysiological changes may be demonstrable in up to 50% of Vigabatrin users.

The retinal toxicity of vigabatrin can be attributed to a [[taurine]] depletion.<ref name="PMID 22476345">{{en icon}} {{Aut|Gaucher D, Arnault E, Husson Z et al.}} Taurine deficiency damages retinal neurones: cone photoreceptors and retinal ganglion cells.

==Pharmacology==
Vigabatrin is an irreversible [[mechanism-based inhibition|mechanism-based inhibitor]] of [[4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase|gamma-aminobutyric acid aminotransferase]] (GABA-AT), the [[enzyme]] responsible for the [[catabolism]] of [[GABA]], which increases the level of [[GABA]] in the brain.<ref name=what_is_vigabatrin /><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rogawski MA, Löscher W | title=The neurobiology of antiepileptic drugs.| journal=Nat Rev Neurosci| volume=5|pages=553–564 | year=2004 | pmid = 15208697 | issue=7 | doi=10.1038/nrn1430}}</ref> Vigabatrin is a [[racemic]] compound, and its [S]-[[enantiomer]] is pharmacologically active.<ref name=senantiomer>{{cite journal | first = G. | last = Sheean |author2=Schramm T |author3=Anderson DS |author4=Eadie MJ.  | year = 1992 | title = Vigabatrin--plasma enantiomer concentrations and clinical effects | journal = Clinical and Experimental Neurology | volume = 29 | pages = 107–16 | pmid = 1343855}}</ref><sup>,</sup><ref name=Gram_et_al_1989>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gram L, Larsson OM, Johnsen A, Schousboe A | title=Experimental studies of the influence of vigabatrin on the GABA system | journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume=27 | issue=Suppl 1 | year=1989 | pages=13S–17S | pmid=2757904 | pmc=1379673 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.1989.tb03455.x}}</ref> [[File:Vigabatrin Chimera.pdf|thumb|Crystal Structure (pdb:1OHW) showing vigabatrin binding to specific residues in the active site of GABA-AT, based off experiments by Storici et al.<ref name=Storici_et_al_2003>{{cite journal |author1=Storici Paola |author2=De Biase D |author3=Bossa F |author4=Bruno S |author5=Mozzarelli A |author6=Peneff C |author7=Silverman R |author8=Schirmer T. | title=Structures of  γ-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) Aminotransferase, a Pyridoxal 5’-Phosphate, and [2Fe-2S] Cluster-containing Enzyme, Complexed with γ-Ethynyl-GABA and with the Antiepilepsy Drug Vigabatrin. | journal=The Journal of Biochemistry | year=2003 | doi=10.1074/jbc.M305884200 | pmid=14534310 | volume=279 | issue=1 | pages=363–73}}</ref>]]

==Pharmacokinetics==
With most drugs, elimination half-life is a useful predictor of dosing schedules and the time needed to reach [[steady state|steady state concentration]]s. In the case of vigabatrin, however, it has been found that the half-life of biologic activity is far longer than the elimination half-life.<ref name=bioactivehalflife>{{cite journal | author=Browne TR | title=Pharmacokinetics of antiepileptic drugs | journal=Neurology | volume=51 | issue=5 suppl 4 | year=1998 | pages=S2–7 | pmid=9818917 | doi=10.1212/wnl.51.5_suppl_4.s2}}</ref>

For vigabatrin, there is no range of target concentrations because researchers found no difference between the serum concentration levels of responders and those of non-responders.<ref name=karolinska_no_correlation>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lindberger M, Luhr O, Johannessen SI, Larsson S, Tomson T | title=Serum concentrations and effects of gabapentin and vigabatrin: observations from a dose titration study | journal=Therapeutic Drug Monitoring | volume=25 | issue=4 | year=2003 | pages=457&ndash;62 | pmid=12883229 | doi=10.1097/00007691-200308000-00007}}</ref> Instead, the duration of action is believed to be more a function of the GABA-T resynthesis rate; levels of GABA-T do not usually return to their normal state until six days after stopping the medication.<ref name=Gram_et_al_1989 />

==History==
Vigabatrin was developed in the 1980s with the specific goal of increasing GABA concentrations in the brain in order to stop an epileptic seizure. To do this, the drug was designed to irreversibly inhibit the GABA transaminase, which degrades the GABA substrate. Although the drug was approved for treatment in the United Kingdom in 1989, the authorized use of Vigabatrin by US Food and Drug Administration was delayed twice in the United States before 2009. It was delayed in 1983 because animal trials produced intramyelinic edema, however, the effects were not apparent in human trials so the drug design continued. In 1997, the trials were temporarily suspended because it was linked to peripheral visual field defects in humans.<ref name=drug_design>{{cite journal | author=Ben-Menachem E. | title=Mechanism of Action of vigabatrin: correcting misperceptions | journal=Acta Neurologica Scandinavica | volume=124 | pages=5 | year=2011 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0404.2011.01596.x}}</ref>
