==Medical uses==

===Birth control pills===
At low doses, levonorgestrel is used in [[oral contraceptive formulations|monophasic]] and [[oral contraceptive formulations|triphasic]] formulations of [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]s, with available monophasic doses ranging from 100–250&nbsp;µg, and triphasic doses of 50&nbsp;µg/75&nbsp;µg/125&nbsp;µg. It is combined with the estrogen [[ethinylestradiol]] in these formulations.

At very low daily dose of 30&nbsp;µg, levonorgestrel is used in some [[progestogen only pill]] 
[[oral contraceptive formulations#Progestogen-only pills|formulations]].

===Emergency birth control===
Levonorgestrel is used in [[Emergency contraceptive pill#Emergency contraceptive pills .28ECPs.29|emergency contraceptive pills]] (ECPs), both in a combined [[Yuzpe regimen]] which includes estrogen, and as a levonorgestrel-only method. The levonorgestrel-only method uses levonorgestrel 1.5&nbsp;mg (as a single dose or as two 0.75&nbsp;mg doses 12 hours apart) taken within 3 days of unprotected sex, with one study indicating that beginning as late as 120 hours (5 days) after intercourse could be effective.

The primary mechanism of action of levonorgestrel as a progestogen-only emergency contraceptive pill is, according to [[International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics]] (FIGO), to prevent fertilization by inhibition of [[ovulation]] and thickening of cervical mucus.<ref name="Trussell 2011">{{cite book|last1=Trussell|first1=James|last2=Schwarz|first2=Eleanor Bimla|year=2011|chapter=Emergency contraception|editor1-last=Hatcher|editor1-first=Robert A.|editor2-last=Trussell|editor2-first=James|editor3-last=Nelson|editor3-first=Anita L.|editor4-last=Cates|editor4-first=Willard Jr.|editor5-last=Kowal|editor5-first=Deborah|editor6-last=Policar|editor6-first=Michael S.|title=Contraceptive technology|edition=20th revised|location=New York|publisher=Ardent Media|isbn=978-1-59708-004-0|issn=0091-9721|oclc=781956734|pages=113–145}} p. 121:<blockquote>Mechanism of action<br/>Copper-releasing IUCs<br/>When used as a regular or emergency method of contraception, copper-releasing IUCs act primarily to prevent fertilization.

After intake of 1.5&nbsp;mg levonorgestrel in [[clinical trial]]s, very common [[side effect]]s (reported by 10% or more) included: [[urticaria|hives]], [[dizziness]], [[headache]], [[nausea]], [[abdominal pain]], [[uterine pain]], [[delayed menstruation]], [[heavy menstruation]], [[uterine bleeding]], and [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]]; common side effects (reported by 1% to 10%) included [[diarrhea]], [[vomiting]], and [[painful menstruation]]; these side effects usually disappeared within 48&nbsp;hours.<ref>{{cite web|author=HRA Pharma|date=November 2013|chapter=4.8 Undesireable effects|title=NorLevo 1.5 mg tablet Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC)|location=Dublin|publisher=Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association|chapterurl=http://www.medicines.ie/medicine/11933/SPC/Norlevo+1.5mg+tablet/#UNDESIRABLE_EFFECTS|accessdate=April 9, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmc= 3992142 | pmid=24708811 | doi=10.1186/1756-0500-7-209 | volume=7 | title=Acute urticaria as a side effect of the Mirena® (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system): a case report | author=Chen X, Wu X, Zhu H | journal=BMC Res Notes | page=209}}</ref>

If taken together with drugs that [[enzyme inducer|induce]] the [[CYP3A4]] [[cytochrome P450]] [[liver]] [[enzyme]], levonorgestrel may be [[metabolism|metabolized]] faster and may have lower effectiveness.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency|title=Levonorgestrel-containing emergency hormonal contraception: advice on interactions with hepatic enzyme inducers and contraceptive efficacy|url=https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/levonorgestrel-containing-emergency-hormonal-contraception-advice-on-interactions-with-hepatic-enzyme-inducers-and-contraceptive-efficacy|website=GOV.UK|accessdate=6 June 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170121212031/https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/levonorgestrel-containing-emergency-hormonal-contraception-advice-on-interactions-with-hepatic-enzyme-inducers-and-contraceptive-efficacy|archivedate=21 January 2017|language=English|date=15 September 2016|deadurl=yes|df=}}</ref>
