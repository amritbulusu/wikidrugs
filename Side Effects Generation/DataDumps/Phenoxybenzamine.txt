'''Phenoxybenzamine''' (marketed under the trade name '''Dibenzyline''') is a non-selective, [[irreversible antagonist|irreversible]] [[alpha blocker]].

==Uses==
It is used in the treatment of [[hypertension]], and specifically that caused by [[pheochromocytoma]]. It has a slower onset and a longer-lasting effect compared with other alpha blockers.

It was also the first [[alpha blocker]] to be used for treatment of [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]],<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Caine M, Perlberg S, Meretyk S |title=A placebo-controlled double-blind study of the effect of phenoxybenzamine in benign prostatic obstruction |journal=British journal of urology |volume=50 |issue=7 |pages=551–4 |year=1978 |pmid=88984 |doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.1978.tb06210.x}}</ref> although it is currently seldom used for that indication due to unfavourable side effects.

It has been used in the treatment of [[hypoplastic left heart syndrome]].<ref name="pmid17646482">{{cite journal |author=Guzzetta NA |title=Phenoxybenzamine in the treatment of hypoplastic left heart syndrome: a core review |journal=Anesth. Analg. |volume=105 |issue=2 |pages=312–5 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17646482 |doi=10.1213/01.ane.0000275185.44796.92 |url=http://www.anesthesia-analgesia.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17646482}}</ref>

It is also used in [[complex regional pain syndrome]] (CRPS) type 1 due to its anti-adrenergic affects. It has shown to be beneficial if used in the first 3 months of the CRPS diagnosis.

===Investigational===
Phenoxybenzamine has long been known to block [[ejaculation]] without affecting semen quality or ability to achieve orgasm, which could make it an effective male contraceptive. This effect is completely reversible, and is believed to be the result of alpha-1 adrenoceptor blockade in the longitudinal muscles of the [[vas deferens]].<ref name=Aitken>{{cite journal |vauthors=Aitken RJ, Baker MA, Doncel GF, Matzuk MM, Mauck CK, Harper MJ |title=As the world grows: contraception in the 21st century |journal=J Clin Invest |volume=118 |issue=4 |pages=1330–43 |date=April 2008 |pmid=18382745 |pmc=2276786 |doi=10.1172/JCI33873}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kjaergaard N, Kjaergaard B, Lauritsen JG |title=Prazosin, an adrenergic blocking agent inadequate as male contraceptive pill |journal=Contraception |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=621–9 |date=June 1988 |pmid=2899490 |doi=10.1016/0010-7824(88)90008-X}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0010-7824(84)90022-2 |vauthors=Homonnai ZT, Shilon M, Paz GF |title=Phenoxybenzamine—an effective male contraceptive pill |journal=Contraception |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=479–91 |date=May 1984 |pmid=6430643}}</ref> As of 2008, research was underway to identify possible drug candidates that share this effect but act specifically on the reproductive tract, unlike phenoxybenzamine.<ref name=Aitken/>

==Pharmacology==
Phenoxybenzamine is used as an anti-hypertensive due to its efficacy in reducing the [[vasoconstriction]] caused by [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline) and [[norepinephrine]]. Phenoxybenzamine forms a permanent covalent bond with [[adrenergic receptor]]s.  Based on known information about the structures of these receptors, it likely involves attack by the cysteine at position 3.36 in transmembrane helix 3 to form a stable linkage.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Frang H, Cockcroft V, Karskela T, Scheinin M, Marjamäki A |title=Phenoxybenzamine binding reveals the helical orientation of the third transmembrane domain of adrenergic receptors |journal=J. Biol. Chem. |volume=276 |issue=33 |pages=31279–84 |year=2001 |pmid=11395517 |doi=10.1074/jbc.M104167200}}</ref> Thus, it remains permanently bound to the receptor, preventing adrenaline and noradrenaline from binding. This causes vasodilatation in blood vessels, due to its [[enzyme antagonist|antagonistic]] effect at the alpha-1 adrenoceptor found in the walls of blood vessels, resulting in a drop in blood pressure. A side effect of phenoxybenzamine is reflex [[tachycardia]].

As a non-selective alpha receptor antagonist, it will also affect both the postsynaptic alpha 1 and presynaptic alpha 2 receptors in the nervous system, and so reduce [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic activity]]. This results in further vasodilation, pupil constriction, an increase in [[Human gastrointestinal tract|GI tract]] motility and secretions, and [[glycogen]] synthesis.

Clinically, non-selective alpha antagonists block alpha receptors (but do not differentiate between alpha-1 and alpha-2). They are used as antihypertensives because they block alpha-receptor-mediated vasoconstriction. The block on alpha-2 receptors further potentiates beta-effects, increasing cardiac output.

Phenoxybenzamine has a long-lasting action, binding covalently to the alpha receptors. Its only current clinical use is in preparing patients with [[pheochromocytoma]] for surgery; its irreversible antagonism and the resultant depression in the maximum of the agonist dose-response curve are desirable in a situation where surgical manipulation of the tumour may release a large bolus of pressor amine into the circulation. Typically, phenoxybenzamine is not used in the long term, as new receptors are made to upregulate alpha stimulation. The main limiting side-effects of alpha antagonists is that the baroreceptor reflex is disrupted and thus this can cause postural hypotension.

Phenoxybenzamine also has [[irreversible antagonist|irreversible]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]]/weak [[partial agonist]] properties at the [[serotonin]] [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor]].<ref name="Doggrell1995">{{cite journal|last1=Doggrell|first1=S.
