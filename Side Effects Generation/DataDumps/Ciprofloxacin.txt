==Medical uses==
Ciprofloxacin is used to treat a wide variety of infections, including infections of bones and joints, [[endocarditis]], [[gastroenteritis]], [[malignant otitis externa]], [[respiratory tract infections]], [[cellulitis]], [[urinary tract infections]], [[prostatitis]], [[anthrax]], and [[chancroid]].<ref name=AHFS2015/>

Ciprofloxacin only treats bacterial infections; it does not treat viral infections such as the common cold. For certain uses including acute sinusitis, lower respiratory tract infections and uncomplicated gonorrhea, ciprofloxacin is not considered a first-line agent.

Ciprofloxacin occupies an important role in treatment guidelines issued by major medical societies for the treatment of serious infections, especially those likely to be caused by Gram-negative bacteria, including ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''.  For example, ciprofloxacin in combination with [[metronidazole]] is one of several first-line antibiotic regimens recommended by the Infectious Diseases Society of America for the treatment of community-acquired abdominal infections in adults.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/649554 |pmid=20034345 |title=Diagnosis and Management of Complicated Intra‐abdominal Infection in Adults and Children: Guidelines by the Surgical Infection Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=133–64 |year=2010 |last1=Solomkin |first1=Joseph S. |last2=Mazuski |first2=John E. |last3=Bradley |first3=John S. |last4=Rodvold |first4=Keith A. |last5=Goldstein |first5=Ellie J.

In other cases, treatment guidelines  are more restrictive, recommending in most cases that older, narrower-spectrum drugs be used as first-line therapy for less severe infections to minimize fluoroquinolone-resistance development.  For example, the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends the use of ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones in urinary tract infections be reserved to cases of proven or expected resistance to narrower-spectrum drugs such as [[nitrofurantoin]] or [[trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/cid/ciq257 |pmid=21292654 |title=International Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Treatment of Acute Uncomplicated Cystitis and Pyelonephritis in Women: A 2010 Update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=52 |issue=5 |pages=e103–20 |year=2011 |last1=Gupta |first1=K. |last2=Hooton |first2=T.

===Pregnancy===
In the United States ciprofloxacin is [[pregnancy category]] C.<ref name=USlabel2016/> This category includes drugs for which no adequate and well-controlled studies in human pregnancy exist, and for which animal studies have suggested the potential for harm to the fetus, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women
despite potential risks. An expert review of published data on experiences with ciprofloxacin use during  pregnancy by the Teratogen Information System concluded therapeutic doses during
pregnancy are unlikely to pose a substantial teratogenic risk (quantity and quality of data=fair), but the data are insufficient to state no risk exists.<ref>{{cite journal |pmc=1801454 |last1=Friedman |first1=J. |last2=Polifka |first2=J. |title=Teratogenic effects of drugs: a resource for clinicians (TERIS) |journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |date=May 1995 |volume=56 |issue=5 |pages=1249–50 }}</ref>

Other adverse events occurred at rates of <1%.

===Tendinitis===
The [[Boxed warning|black box warning]] on the U.S. FDA-approved ciprofloxacin label warns of an increased risk of [[tendinitis]] and tendon rupture, especially in people who are older than 60 years, people who also use corticosteroids, and people with kidney, lung, or heart transplants. Tendon rupture can occur during therapy or even months after discontinuation of the drug.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=10970974 |url=http://www.masson.fr/masson/MDOI-RCO-09-2000-86-5-0035-1040-101019-ART7 |date=September 2000 |last1=Saint |first1=F |last2=Gueguen |last3=Biserte |last4=Fontaine |last5=Mazeman |title=Rupture du ligament patellaire un mois après traitement par fluoroquinolone |trans_title=Rupture of the patellar ligament one month after treatment with fluoroquinolone |language=French |volume=86 |issue=5 |pages=495–7 |journal=Revue de chirurgie orthopedique et reparatrice de l'appareil moteur }}</ref> A case control study<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7349.1306 |pmid=12039823 |pmc=113766 |title=Fluoroquinolones and risk of Achilles tendon disorders: Case-control study |journal=BMJ |volume=324 |issue=7349 |pages=1306–7 |year=2002 |last1=Van Der Linden |first1=P D |last2=Sturkenboom |first2=M.

A study performed using an Italian healthcare database reached qualitatively similar conclusions.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2165/00002018-200629100-00006 |pmid=16970512 |title=Evidence of Tendinitis Provoked by Fluoroquinolone Treatment |journal=Drug Safety |volume=29 |issue=10 |pages=889–96 |year=2006 |last1=Corrao |first1=Giovanni |last2=Zambon |first2=Antonella |last3=Bertù |first3=Lorenza |last4=Mauri |first4=Anna |last5=Paleari |first5=Valentina |last6=Rossi |first6=Camillo |last7=Venegoni |first7=Mauro }}</ref>

===Nervous system===
The 2013 FDA label warns of nervous system effects. Ciprofloxacin, like other fluoroquinolones, is known to trigger seizures or lower the seizure threshold, and may cause other central nervous system side effects. Headache, dizziness, and insomnia have been reported as occurring fairly commonly in postapproval review articles, along with a much lower incidence of serious CNS side effects such as tremors, psychosis, anxiety, hallucinations, paranoia, and suicide attempts, especially at higher doses.<ref name=He2013/> Like other fluoroquinolones, it is also known to cause peripheral neuropathy that may be irreversible, such as weakness, burning pain, tingling or numbness.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm365050.htm |title=FDA Drug Safety Communication: FDA requires label changes to warn of risk for possibly permanent nerve damage from antibacterial fluoroquinolone drugs taken by mouth or by injection |work= |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528231716/http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm365050.htm |archivedate=28 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===Cancer===
Ciprofloxacin is active in six of eight ''in vitro'' assays used as rapid screens for the detection of genotoxic effects, but is not active in ''in vivo'' assays of genotoxicity.<ref name=USlabel2016/> Long-term carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice resulted in no carcinogenic or tumorigenic effects due to ciprofloxacin at daily oral dose levels up to 250 and 750&nbsp;mg/kg to rats and mice, respectively (about 1.7 and 2.5 times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon mg/m<sup>2</sup>). Results from photo co-carcinogenicity testing indicate ciprofloxacin does not reduce the time to appearance of UV-induced skin tumors as compared to vehicle control.

===Other===
The other black box warning is that ciprofloxacin should not be used in patients with [[myasthenia gravis]] due to possible exacerbation of muscle weakness which may lead to breathing problems resulting in death or ventilator support. Fluoroquinolones are known to block neuromuscular transmission.<ref name=USlabel2016/>

==Overdose==
Overdose of ciprofloxacin may result in reversible renal toxicity. Treatment of overdose includes emptying of the stomach by induced vomiting or [[gastric lavage]], as well as administration of antacids containing magnesium, aluminum, or calcium to reduce drug absorption. Renal function and urinary pH should be monitored. Important support includes adequate hydration and urine acidification if necessary to prevent crystalluria. [[Hemodialysis]] or [[peritoneal dialysis]] can only remove less than 10% of ciprofloxacin.<ref name="FDA 81532304, R.1">{{cite web |title=Cipro Labeling Revision 04/06/2009 Supplement 073 |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/019537s073,020780s030lbl.pdf |publisher=US Food and Drug Administration |date=6 April 2009 |accessdate=8 September 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705053513/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/019537s073,020780s030lbl.pdf |archivedate=5 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Ciprofloxacin may be quantified in plasma or serum to monitor for drug accumulation in patients with hepatic dysfunction or to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in acute overdose victims.<ref>R.

==Interactions==
Ciprofloxacin interacts with certain foods and several other drugs leading to undesirable increases or decreases in the serum levels or distribution of one or both drugs.

Ciprofloxacin should not be taken with antacids containing magnesium or aluminum, highly buffered drugs ([[sevelamer]], [[lanthanum carbonate]], [[sucralfate]], [[didanosine]]), or with supplements containing calcium, iron, or zinc. It should be taken two hours before or six hours after these products. Magnesium or aluminum antacids turn ciprofloxacin into insoluble salts that are not readily absorbed by the intestinal tract, reducing peak serum concentrations by 90% or more, leading to therapeutic failure. Additionally, it should not be taken with dairy products or calcium-fortified juices alone, as peak serum concentration and the area under the serum concentration-time curve can be reduced up to 40%. However, ciprofloxacin may be taken with dairy products or calcium-fortified juices as part of a meal.<ref name="FDA 81532304, R.1"/><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/clinids/17.supplement_1.s192 |pmid=8399914 |title=New Oral Macrolide and Fluoroquinolone Antibiotics: An Overview of Pharmacokinetics, Interactions, and Safety |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=17 |pages=S192–9 |year=1993 |last1=Rodvold |first1=K.

Ciprofloxacin inhibits the drug-metabolizing enzyme [[CYP1A2]] and thereby can reduce the clearance of drugs metabolized by that enzyme. CYP1A2 substrates that exhibit increased serum levels in ciprofloxacin-treated patients include [[tizanidine]], [[theophylline]], [[caffeine]], [[methylxanthines]], [[clozapine]], [[olanzapine]], and [[ropinirole]]. Co-administration of ciprofloxacin with the CYP1A2 substrate tizanidine (Zanaflex) is contraindicated due to a 583% increase in the peak serum concentrations of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin as compared to administration of tizanidine alone. Use of ciprofloxacin is cautioned in patients on theophylline due to its narrow therapeutic index. The authors of one review recommended that patients being treated with ciprofloxacin reduce their caffeine intake. Evidence for significant interactions with several other CYP1A2 substrates such as [[cyclosporine]] is equivocal or conflicting.<ref name="Bolhuis MS, Panday PN, Pranger AD, Kosterink JG, Alffenaar JW 2011 865–913"/><ref name=ctcos/><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/jac/26.suppl_D.7 |pmid=2286594 |title=Drug interactions with quinolones |journal=Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy |volume=26 |pages=7–29 |year=1990 |last1=Janknegt |first1=R. }}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Ciprofloxacin is a [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]] of the [[Quinolone antibiotic|fluoroquinolone]] class. It is active against both [[Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative]] bacteria. It functions by inhibiting [[DNA gyrase]], and a type II [[topoisomerase]], topoisomerase IV,<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=9293187 |pmc=232616 |year=1997 |author1=Drlica |first1=K |title=DNA gyrase, topoisomerase IV, and the 4-quinolones |journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=377–92 |last2=Zhao |first2=X }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.chembiol.2010.04.012 |pmid=20534341 |title=DNA Topoisomerases and Their Poisoning by Anticancer and Antibacterial Drugs |journal=Chemistry & Biology |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=421–33 |year=2010 |last1=Pommier |first1=Yves |last2=Leo |first2=Elisabetta |last3=Zhang |first3=Hongliang |last4=Marchand |first4=Christophe }}</ref> necessary to separate bacterial DNA, thereby inhibiting cell division.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Ciprofloxacin for systemic administration is available as immediate-release tablets, extended-release tablets, an oral suspension, and as a solution for intravenous administration. 
When administered over one hour as an intravenous infusion,<ref name=USlabel2016/> ciprofloxacin rapidly distributes into the tissues, with levels in some tissues exceeding those in the serum.  Penetration into the central nervous system is relatively modest, with cerebrospinal fluid levels normally less than 10% of peak serum concentrations.  The serum half-life of ciprofloxacin is about 4–6 hours, with 50-70% of an administered dose being excreted in the urine as unmetabolized drug. An additional 10% is excreted in urine as metabolites.  Urinary excretion is virtually complete 24 hours after administration. Dose adjustment is required in the elderly and in those with renal impairment.

Ciprofloxacin is weakly bound to serum proteins (20-40%), but is an inhibitor of the drug-metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 1A2, which leads to the potential for clinically important drug interactions with drugs metabolized by that enzyme.{{medical citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Ciprofloxacin is about 70% orally available when administered orally, so a slightly higher dose is needed to achieve the same exposure when switching from IV to oral administration<ref name=USlabel2016/>

The extended release oral tablets<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2003/21554_ciproXR_lbl.pdf|title=Cipro XR Prescribing Information|format=|work=|accessdate=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230232923/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2003/21554_ciproXR_lbl.pdf|archivedate=30 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> allow once-daily administration by releasing the drug more slowly in the gastrointestinal tract. These tablets contain 35% of the administered dose in an immediate-release form and 65% in a slow-release matrix.  Maximum serum concentrations are achieved between 1 and 4 hours after administration. Compared to the 250- and 500-mg immediate-release tablets, the 500-mg and 1000-mg XR tablets provide higher C<sub>max</sub>, but the 24‑hour AUCs are equivalent.

Ciprofloxacin immediate-release tablets contain ciprofloxacin as the hydrochloride salt, and the XR tablets contain a mixture of the hydrochloride salt as the free base.

==History==
[[File:Cipro 250 mg.JPG|thumb|Ciprofloxacin 250-mg tablets from Ukraine]]

===Cost===
It is available as a generic medication and not very expensive.<ref name=AHFS2015/><ref name=Ric2014/> Wholesale it costs between 0.03 and 0.13 USD a dose.<ref name=ERC2015/> In the United States it is sold for about 0.40 USD per dose.<ref name=AHFS2015/>

===Generic equivalents===
On 24 October 2001, the Prescription Access Litigation (PAL) project filed suit to dissolve an agreement between Bayer and three of its competitors which produced [[Generic drugs|generic versions of drugs]] ([[Barr Pharmaceuticals|Barr Laboratories]], [[Actavis|Rugby Laboratories]], and [[Marion Merrell Dow|Hoechst-Marion-Roussel]]) that PAL claimed was blocking access to adequate supplies and cheaper, generic versions of ciprofloxacin. The plaintiffs charged that Bayer Corporation, a unit of Bayer AG, had unlawfully paid the three competing companies a total of $200 million to prevent cheaper, generic versions of ciprofloxacin from being brought to the market, as well as manipulating its price and supply. Numerous other consumer advocacy groups joined the lawsuit. On 15 October 2008, five years after Bayer's patent had expired, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York granted Bayer's and the other defendants' motion for summary judgment, holding that any anticompetitive effects caused by the settlement agreements between Bayer and its codefendants were within the exclusionary zone of the patent and thus could not be redressed by federal antitrust law,<ref>{{cite web|author=United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit |title=United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit |url=http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/08-1097.pdf |location=USA |format=PDF |year=2008 |accessdate=4 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827080527/http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/08-1097.pdf |archivedate=27 August 2009 }}</ref> in effect upholding Bayer's agreement with its competitors.

===Available forms===
Ciprofloxacin for systemic administration is available as immediate-release tablets, as extended-release tablets, as an oral suspension, and as a solution for intravenous infusion. It is also available for local administration as eye drops and ear drops.

===Litigation===
A class action was filed against Bayer AG on behalf of employees of the Brentwood Post Office in Washington, D.C., and workers at the U.S. Capitol, along with employees of American Media, Inc. in Florida and postal workers in general who alleged they suffered serious adverse effects from taking ciprofloxacin (Cipro) in the aftermath of the [[2001 anthrax attacks|anthrax attacks in 2001]]. The action alleged Bayer failed to warn class members of the potential side effects of the drug, thereby violating the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Laws. The class action was defeated and the litigation abandoned by the plaintiffs.<ref>{{cite web |title=Legal Brief of Postal Employees Cases (EEOC, MSPB, District Courts) |url=http://www.lunewsviews.com/legal_briefs_archives.htm#cipro |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021073109/http://www.lunewsviews.com/legal_briefs_archives.htm#cipro |archivedate=21 October 2007 |publisher=Postal Reporter |location=USA |accessdate=9 September 2009}}</ref>
