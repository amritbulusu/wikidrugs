'''Chloroprocaine''' (trade name '''Nesacaine''', '''Nesacaine-MPF''') (often in the hydrochloride salt form as the aforementioned trade names) is a [[local anesthetic]] given by [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] during [[surgery|surgical procedures]] and [[childbirth|labor and delivery]]. Chloroprocaine [[Vasodilation|vasodilates]]; this is in contrast to cocaine which vasoconstrics. Chloroprocaine is an ester anesthetic.<ref>[http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01161 Drug bank entry for Chloroprocaine]</ref>

==Subarachnoid block==

Chloroprocaine was developed to meet the need for a short-acting spinal anaesthetic that is reliable and has a favourable safety profile to support the growing need for day-case surgery. 
Licensed in Europe for surgical procedures up to 40 minutes, chloroprocaine is an ester-type local anaesthetic with the shortest duration of action of all the established local anaesthetics.  It has a significantly shorter duration of action than lidocaine and is significantly less toxic.
Chloroprocaine has a motor block lasting for 40 minutes, a rapid onset time of 3–5 minutes (9.6 min ± 7.3 min at 40&nbsp;mg dose; 7.9 min ± 6.0 min at 50&nbsp;mg dose) and a time to ambulation of 90 minutes without complications, especially lacking transient neurologic symptomatology.

These data are based upon a retrospective review of 672 patients suitable for spinal anaesthesia in surgical procedures  less than 60 minutes' duration using 30–40&nbsp;mg chloroprocaine. The results showed good surgical anaesthesia, a fast onset time, and postoperative mobilization after 90 minutes without complications.<ref>Ampres (chloroprocaine) Summary of Product Characteristics, Palas T, Cloroprocaina in chirurgia ambulatoriale: uno studio osservazionale, Perimed 2009, 3(2):31-34</ref>

==Obstetrics==

Amide-linked local anesthetic agents, such as [[lidocaine]] and [[bupivacaine]], can become "trapped" in their ionized forms on the fetal side of the [[placenta]], so their net transfer across the placenta is increased. An ester-linked local anesthetic agent, such as 2-chloroprocaine, is rapidly metabolized, and placental transfer is limited. Since the metabolism of 2-chloroprocaine by fetal plasma is slower than in maternal plasma, the potential for ion trapping exists. Fetal pH is slightly lower than maternal (7.32 to 7.38), thus most unionized drugs are "ion trapped" to a degree, even in a healthy fetus. Chloroprocaine (pKa 8.7) is the drug of choice for [[epidural]] analgesia and a decompensating fetus, because it does not participate in ion trapping.  Placental transfer of 2-chloroprocaine is not influenced by fetal acidosis.<ref>Philipson EH, Kuhnert BR, Syracuse CD. Fetal acidosis, 2-chloroprocaine, and epidural anesthesia for cesarean section. Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1985 Feb 1;151(3):322-4.</ref>
 
The ''in vitro'' [[half-life]] of chloroprocaine is 21 seconds for maternal and 43 seconds for fetal blood. In patients who are homozygous atypical for plasma cholinesterase, chloroprocaine typically exists for two minutes in circulation.<ref>Chestnut: Obstetric Anesthesia, 3rd ed, p333.</ref><ref>Hughes: Anesthesia for Obstetrics, 4th ed, p75.</ref>

It is not used in intravenous regional anesthesia due to the risk of [[thrombophlebitis]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Synthesis==
[[File:Chloroprocaine synthesis.png|800px|center|thumb|Chloroprocaine synthesis: H.C. Marks, H.I. Rubin, {{US Patent|2460139}} (1949 to Wallace & Tiernan Inc).]]
The hydrochloride salt of 4-amino-2-chlorobenzoyl chloride is made by the reaction of 2-chloro-4-aminobenzoic acid with thionyl chloride. 
Synthesis of this drug is then accomplished by directly reacting the product of the last step with the hydrochloride salt of [[2-diethylaminoethanol]].
