'''Acetylmethadol''', also known as '''methadyl acetate''', is a [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] [[opioid]] [[analgesic]].<ref name="pmid12373424">{{cite journal |vauthors=Newman JL, Vann RE, May EL, Beardsley PM | title = Heroin discriminative stimulus effects of methadone, LAAM and other isomers of acetylmethadol in rats | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 164 | issue = 1 | pages = 108–14 |date=October 2002 | pmid = 12373424 | doi = 10.1007/s00213-002-1198-8 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00213-002-1198-8}}</ref> It is a [[racemic mixture]] of [[alphacetylmethadol]] (α-acetylmethadol) and [[betacetylmethadol]] (β-acetylmethadol), which are in turn racemic mixtures of [[levacetylmethadol]] (LAAM; <small>L</small>-α-acetylmethadol) and <small>D</small>-α-acetylmethadol and <small>L</small>-β-acetylmethadol and <small>D</small>-β-acetylmethadol, respectively.<ref name="pmid12373424" /> Hence, acetylmethadol has four possible [[optical isomer]]s.<ref name="pmid12373424" /> All of these isomers have been shown to partially or fully substitute for the [[discriminative stimulus]] effects of [[heroin]] in rats, and thus it can be inferred that, in addition to LAAM which is used clinically as such, they are all likely to be [[biological activity|active]] opioid analgesics in humans.<ref name="pmid12373424" />

In the [[United States]], acetylmethadol and its individual isomers are all [[List of Schedule I drugs (US)|Schedule I drug]]s under the [[Controlled Substances Act]], except LAAM, which is Schedule II and was used clinically until 1993.  Acetylmethadol has an ACSCN of 9601.  The isomers have individual ACSCNs, which are as follows: Alphacetylmethadol 9603, Betacetylmethadol 9607, LAAM 9648.  All of the above have annual manufacturing quotas of 2 grammes as of 2013, except LAAM, which is 4 grammes.<ref>{{uscsub|21|812|b|1}}</ref>
