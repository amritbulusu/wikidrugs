'''Topotecan''' (trade name '''Hycamtin''') is a [[chemotherapeutic agent]] that is a [[topoisomerase inhibitor]].  It is a synthetic, water-soluble [[structural analog|analog]] of the natural chemical compound [[camptothecin]]. It is used in the form of its [[hydrochloride]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] to treat [[ovarian cancer]], [[lung cancer]] and other cancer types.

After [[GlaxoSmithKline]] received final [[FDA]] approval for Hycamtin Capsules on October 15, 2007, topotecan became the first topoisomerase I inhibitor for oral use.

==Experimental use==
As of 2016 experiments were under way for [[Neuroblastoma]], [[Brainstem glioma]], [[Ewing's sarcoma]] and [[Angelman's syndrome]]. In addition, topotecan is experimentally treating [[Non-small cell lung cancer]], [[Colorectal cancer|Colorectal Cancer]], [[Breast cancer]], [[Non-Hodgkin lymphoma|Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma]], [[Endometrial cancer]], and [[Oligodendroglioma]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Haglof|first=K|year=2006|title=Recent developments in the clinical activity of topoisomerase-1 inhibitors|journal=Update on Cancer Therapeutics|volume=1|issue=2}}</ref>

=== Angelman's syndrome ===
Angelman’s syndrome is a neuro-genetic disorder characterized by severe developmental delays, seizures, speech impairments and physical impairments. It is an epigenetic disease and other treatments focus on symptoms. It is caused by a deletion or mutation of the maternal allele for the [[ubiquitin]] [[protein]] [[ligase]] E3A.<ref>(Huang et al)</ref> [[UBE3A]] is expressed in most body tissues. However, in neurons only the maternal copy of the gene is expressed. UBE3A is located on [[Chromosome 15 (human)|chromosome 15]] and the paternal copy for the gene is genetically imprinted and is silenced by an [[antisense RNA]] transcript. The maternal copy control center of the gene is methylated, suppressing transcription in the antisense direction while the paternal copy control center is unmethylated.{{sfn|Beaudet|2011}}

Treatment involves unsilencing the paternal allele allowing the normal paternal UBE3A allele to be transcribed. UBE3A, in normal function, adds ubiquitin chains to proteins to target unnecessary or damaged proteins for degradation by the [[proteasome]].<ref>(Malzac)</ref>

16 topoisomerasesinhibitors unsilence paternal UBE3A. Topoisomerases are enzymes that regulate the unwinding of DNA.<ref>(Miller)</ref> Of these 16 inhibitors, topotecan was found to induce the strongest upregulation of UBE3A.<ref>(Malpass)</ref> The enzymes bind to the DNA and cut the phosphate backbone, allowing the DNA to be unwound. Topotecan unsilences the paternal UBE2A allele by reducing the transcription of an antisense transcript. Topotecan inhibits topoisomerase I restoring UBE3A levels to wild-type range in cultured mince neurons.<ref>(Huang)</ref>

Transgenic mice with a fluorescently tagged UBE3A were used to test the effectiveness of unsilencing the paternal copy.{{sfn|Beaudet|2011}} When tested on mice ''in vivo'', topotecan affected the [[hippocampus]], [[striatum]] and [[cerebral cortex]] but not the [[cerebellum]] unless a higher dose was administered (21.6 micrograms/hour for five days). The study suggested that the topoisomerase inhibitors have the potential to produce a normally functioning UBE3A protein. Most symptoms due to Angelman’s syndrome are traditionally treated by [[speech therapy]], [[physical therapy]] and [[occupational therapy]]. [[Anticonvulsant|Anti-seizure medication]] is often prescribed as seizures are a common symptom of Angelman’s syndrome.<ref>(Aditi and Williams)</ref> These treatments target only symptoms.

This drug has been administered to cancer patients. It was well-tolerated when administered to pediatric and adult patients.

==Mechanism of action==
Topotecan is a semi-synthetic derivative of [[camptothecin]]. Camptothecin is a natural product extracted from the bark of the tree [[Camptotheca|''Camptotheca acuminata'']]. Topoisomerase-I is a nuclear enzyme that relieves torsional strain in [[DNA]] by opening single strand breaks.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pommier | first1 = Y. | last2 = Leo | first2 = E. | last3 = Zhang | first3 = H. | last4 = Marchand | first4 = C. | year = 2010 | title = DNA topoisomerases and their poisoning by anticancer and antibacterial drugs | url = | journal = Chem.
