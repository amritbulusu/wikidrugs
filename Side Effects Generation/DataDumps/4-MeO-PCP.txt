'''4-Methoxyphencyclidine''' ('''methoxydine''', '''4-MeO-PCP''') is a [[Dissociative drug|dissociative]] [[anesthesia|anesthetic]] drug that has been sold online as a [[designer drug|research chemical]]. The synthesis of 4-MeO-PCP was first reported in 1965 by the [[Parke-Davis]] medicinal chemist Victor Maddox.<ref name=Morris>{{cite journal|first1=H.|last1=Morris|first2=J.|last2=Wallach|title=From PCP to MXE: a comprehensive review of the non-medical use of dissociative drugs|journal=Drug Testing and Analysis|year=2014|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dta.1620/abstract||doi=10.1002/dta.1620|volume=6|pages=614–632|pmid=24678061}}</ref> A 1999 review published by a chemist using the pseudonym John Q.

==Legality==

On October 18, 2012 the [[Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs]] in the [[United Kingdom]] released a [http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/agencies-public-bodies/acmd1/methoxetamine2012 report] about [[methoxetamine]], saying that the "harms of methoxetamine are commensurate with [[Class B drug|Class B]] of the [[Misuse of Drugs Act of 1971|Misuse of Drugs Act (1971)]]", despite the fact that the act does not classify drugs based on harm. The report went on to suggest that all analogues of MXE should also become class B drugs and suggested a catch-all clause covering both existing and unresearched arylcyclohexamines, including 4-MeO-PCP.<ref name='ACMD MXE report' />

Sweden's public health agency suggested classifying 4-MeO-PCP as hazardous substance on November 10, 2014.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/nyheter-och-press/nyhetsarkiv/2014/november/cannabinoider-foreslas-bli-klassade-som-halsofarlig-vara/ | title=Cannabinoider föreslås bli klassade som hälsofarlig vara | publisher=Folkhälsomyndigheten | accessdate=29 June 2015}}</ref>
