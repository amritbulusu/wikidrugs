'''Dexfenfluramine''', marketed as '''dexfenfluramine hydrochloride''' under the name '''Redux''', is a [[serotonergic]] [[anorectic]] drug: it reduces appetite by increasing the amount of extracellular [[serotonin]] in the brain.<ref name="stuart">Stuart Ira Fox. Human Physiology. Twelfth Edition. McGraw Hill. 2011. p.665.</ref> It is the d-[[enantiomer]] of [[fenfluramine]] and is structurally similar to [[amphetamine]], but lacks any psychologically stimulating effects.

Dexfenfluramine was, for some years in the mid-1990s, approved by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] for the purposes of [[weight loss]]. However, following multiple concerns about the cardiovascular side-effects of the drug,<ref name="stuart"/> the FDA withdrew the approval in 1997.<ref>FDA September 15, 1997. [http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm179871.htm FDA Announces Withdrawal Fenfluramine and Dexfenfluramine (Fen-Phen)]</ref>  After it was removed in the US, dexfenfluramine was also pulled out in other global markets. It was later superseded by [[sibutramine]], which, although initially considered a safer alternative to both dexfenfluramine and [[fenfluramine]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, was likewise removed from the US market in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20101008-710904.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023191137/http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20101008-710904.html |archivedate=23 October 2010|title=Abbott Pulls Diet Drug Meridia Off US Shelves|date=8 October 2010|newspaper=Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

The drug was developed by [[Interneuron Pharmaceuticals]], a company co-founded by [[Richard Wurtman]], aimed at marketing discoveries by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] scientists.<ref name=LemonickEtal1996p4/> Interneuron licensed the patent to [[Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories]].<ref name=LemonickeEtal1997p6/> Although at the time of its release, some optimism prevailed that it might herald a new approach{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, there remained some reservations amongst neurologists, twenty-two of whom petitioned the FDA to delay approval{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}. Their concern was based on the work of [[George A. Ricaurte]], whose techniques and conclusions were later questioned.<ref name="titleDEA Accedes to Ecstasy Test">{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,62506,00.html |title=DEA Accedes to Ecstasy Test |accessdate= |work=Wired |date=2 March 2004}}</ref>
