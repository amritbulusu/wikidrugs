'''Bisacodyl''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) is an [[organic compound]] that is used as a stimulant [[laxative]] drug.  It works directly on the colon to produce a bowel movement. It is typically prescribed for relief of [[constipation]] and for the management of [[neurogenic bowel dysfunction]] as well as part of bowel preparation before medical examinations, such as for a [[colonoscopy]].<ref>{{ cite journal | author = Wexner, S.

Bisacodyl is a derivative of [[triphenylmethane]].  It was first used as a laxative in 1953 because of its structural similarity to [[phenolphthalein]].<ref>{{ cite journal | author = Stiens SA |author2= Luttrel W|author3= Binard JE | title = Polyethylene glycol versus vegetable oil based bisacodyl suppositories to initiate side-lying bowel care: a clinical trial in persons with spinal cord injury | journal = Spinal Cord |date=November 1998 | volume = 36 | issue = 11 | pages = 777–81 | pmid = 9848486 | url = http://www.nature.com/sc/journal/v36/n11/pdf/3100702a.pdf | doi=10.1038/sj.sc.3100702}}</ref><ref>Evans, I.

==Available forms==
Bisacodyl is marketed under the trade names '''Dulcolax/Durolax''', '''Muxol''', '''Fleet''', '''Nourilax''', '''Alophen''', '''Correctol''', and '''Carter's Little Pills''' (formerly [[Carter's Little Liver Pills]]<ref>{{ cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,814704,00.html | work = Time | title = Medicine: Cut Out the Liver | date = 1951-04-16 | accessdate = 2010-04-26 }}</ref>) as well as being available [[generic drug|generically]]. It is usually sold as 5&nbsp;mg tablets, 10&nbsp;mg suppositories, or 5&nbsp;mg pediatric suppositories. It is also available as a {{convert|1.25|USfloz|ml}} prepackaged [[enema]] containing a 10&nbsp;mg delivered dose of liquid bisacodyl.<ref name=Ullmann>Robert Engelhorn, Ernst Seeger and Jan H. Zwaving "Laxatives" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2000.  {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a15_183}}</ref>

==Administration==
When bisacodyl is administered orally, it is usually taken at bedtime. Oral administration is known to produce no action for more than eight hours and then to work suddenly and relatively quickly.  This is especially true if more than 10&nbsp;mg is taken at one time.  Normally the dosage is 5 or 10&nbsp;mg, but up to 30&nbsp;mg can be taken for complete cleansing of the bowel before a procedure.  If taken at the maximum dosage, there will likely be a sudden, extremely powerful, uncontrollable bowel movement and so precautions should be taken. It is not recommended to take bisacodyl within one hour of taking an antacid or milk, as this may destroy the tablet coating and irritate the stomach.  If taken too early in the evening, the action of this drug can start during sleep with undesirable results.

When administered rectally in suppository form, it is usually effective in 15 to 60&nbsp;minutes.  Two suppositories can be inserted at once if a very strong, purgative, enema-like result is needed.  A few hours after the initial evacuation, there can be a secondary action which will continue as long as there is unexpelled bisacodyl present in the rectum.

As a small commercially prepared enema, it is usually effective in 5 to 20 minutes.<ref name=Ullmann/>

==Mechanism of action==
Bisacodyl works by stimulating [[enteric nervous system | enteric nerves]] to cause colonic contractions. It is also a contact laxative; it increases fluid and salt secretion.  The action of bisacodyl on the small intestine is negligible; stimulant laxatives mainly promote evacuation of the colon.<ref name=Ullmann/>
