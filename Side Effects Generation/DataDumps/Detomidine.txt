'''Detomidine''' is an [[imidazole]] derivative and [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic]] [[agonist]], used as a large animal [[sedative]], primarily used in [[horse]]s. It is usually available as the [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] detomidine [[hydrochloride]].  It is a [[prescription medication]] available to veterinarians sold under the trade name Dormosedan.

Currently, detomidine is only licensed for use in horses.

==Properties==
Detomidine is a sedative with [[analgesic]] properties.<ref name="England 1996">{{cite journal|last1=England|first1=GC|last2=Clarke|first2=KW|title=Alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonists in the horse—a review|journal=The British veterinary journal|date=November 1996|volume=152|issue=6|pages=641-57|doi=10.1016/S0007-1935(96)80118-7|pmid=8979422}}</ref> α2-adrenergic agonists produce dose-dependent sedative and analgesic effects, mediatated by activation of α2 [[catecholamine]] receptors, thus inducing a [[negative feedback]] response, reducing production of excitatory neurotransmitters. Due to inhibition of the [[sympathetic nervous system]], detomidine also has cardiac and respiratory effects and an [[antidiuretic]] action.<ref name="Fornai 1990">{{cite journal|last1=Fornai|first1=F|last2=Blandizzi|first2=C|last3=del Tacca|first3=M|title=Central alpha-2 adrenoceptors regulate central and peripheral functions|journal=Pharmacological research|date=1990|volume=22|issue=5|pages=541-54|doi=10.1016/S1043-6618(05)80046-5|pmid=2177556}}</ref>

==Effects==
A profound lethargy and characteristic lowering of the head with reduced sensitivity to environmental stimuli (sound, pain, etc.) are seen with detomidine. A short period of reduced coordination is characteristically followed by immobility and a firm stance with front legs spread.  Following administration there is an initial increase in blood pressure, followed by [[bradycardia]] and second degree [[atrioventricular block]] (this is not [[Pathology (disambiguation)|pathologic]] in horses). The horse commonly [[sweat]]s to excess, especially on the flanks and neck. Other side effects reported include pilo erection (hair standing erect), [[ataxia]], [[salivation]], slight muscle tremors, and (rarely) penile prolapse.

==Uses==
Sedation and anaesthetic [[premedication]] in horses and other large animals, commonly combined with [[butorphanol]] for increased analgesia and depth of sedation. In conjunction with [[ketamine]] it may also be used for intravenous [[anaesthesia]] of short duration.

The drug is normally administered by the [[intravenous]] route, and is fastest and most efficient when given intravenously . However, in recalcitrant animals, detomidine may be administered by the [[intramuscular]] or [[sublingual]] routes. The dose range advised by the manufacturers is 20-40&nbsp;µg/kg intravenous for moderate sedation, but this dose may need to be higher if given intramuscularly.

When given intravenously, detomidine usually takes effect in 2–5 minutes, and recovery is full within 30–60 minutes.  However, this is highly dependent upon the dosage, environment, and the individual animal; some horses are highly resistant to sedation.

==Cautions==
As detomidine is an [[arrhythmogenic]] agent, extreme care should be exercised in horses with cardiac disease, and in the concurrent administration of other arrhythmogenics. The concurrent use of potentiated [[sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]] [[antibiotics]] is considered particularly dangerous.

Detomidine is a poor premedication when using [[ketamine]] as an anesthetic in horses.

Anesthetic recoveries in horses that have received ketamine following a detomidine premedication are often violent with the horse having multiple failures to stand resulting in trauma to itself.  [[Xylazine]] is a superior premedication with ketamine resulting in safer recoveries.
