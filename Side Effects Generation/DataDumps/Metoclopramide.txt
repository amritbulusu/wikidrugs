==Adverse effects==
[[Image:Metoclopramide ampule.jpg|thumb|Plastic [[ampoule]] of metoclopramide]]

Common [[adverse drug reaction]]s (ADRs) associated with metoclopramide therapy include restlessness ([[akathisia]]), and [[focal dystonia]]. Infrequent ADRs include [[hypertension]], [[hypotension]], [[hyperprolactinaemia]] leading to [[galactorrhea]], constipation, depression, headache, and [[Extrapyramidal symptoms|extrapyramidal effects]] such as [[oculogyric crisis]]. Rare but serious ADRs associated with metoclopramide therapy include [[agranulocytosis]], [[supraventricular tachycardia]], [[hyperaldosteronism]], [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]], [[akathisia]] and [[tardive dyskinesia]].<ref name=AMH2006/><ref name=label>FDA [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2011/017854s058lbl.pdf reglan tablets Label] Page accessed August 24, 2016</ref>

Metoclopramide may be the most common cause of drug-induced [[movement disorder]]s.<ref name=FDA2009/> The risk of extrapyramidal effects is increased in people under 20 years of age, and with high-dose or prolonged therapy.<ref name=Maxolon/><ref name=AMH2006/> Tardive dyskinesia may be persistent and irreversible in some people. The majority of reports of tardive dyskinesia occur in people who have used metoclopramide for more than three months.<ref name=FDA2009/> Consequently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that metoclopramide be used for short-term treatment, preferably less than 12 weeks. In 2009, the FDA required all manufacturers of metoclopramide to issue a [[black box warning]] regarding the risk of tardive dyskinesia with chronic or high-dose use of the drug.<ref name=FDA2009>

Dystonic reactions may be treated with [[benzatropine]], [[diphenhydramine]], [[trihexyphenidyl]], or [[procyclidine]]. Symptoms usually subside with [[diphenhydramine]] injected intramuscularly.<ref>"Metoclopramide (metoclopramide hydrochloride) injection, solution
[Hospira, Inc.]" http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=373ba08b-33ad-49fc-28a7-928e89a65314#nlm34089-3</ref> Agents in the [[benzodiazepine]] class of drugs may be helpful, but benefits are usually modest and side effects of sedation and weakness can be problematic.<ref>Olanow C, Schapira AV.

New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2012.</ref>

In some cases, the [[akathisia]] effects of metoclopramide are directly related to the infusion rate when the drug is administered intravenously. Side effects were usually seen in the first 15 min after the dose of metoclopramide.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Parlak|first=I|author2=Atilla, R |author3=Cicek, M |author4=Parlak, M |author5=Erdur, B |author6=Guryay, M |author7=Sever, M |author8= Karaduman, S |title=Rate of metoclopramide infusion affects the severity and incidence of akathisia.|journal=Emergency medicine journal : EMJ|date=Sep 2005|volume=22|issue=9|pages=621–4|pmid=16113179 |doi=10.1136/emj.2004.014712 |pmc=1726928}}</ref>

==Cautions and contraindications==
Metoclopramide is contraindicated in [[pheochromocytoma]]. It should be used with caution in [[Parkinson's disease]] since, as a dopamine antagonist, it may worsen symptoms. Long-term use should be avoided in people with [[clinical depression]], as it may worsen one's mental state.<ref name=AMH2006/> It is contraindicated for people with a suspected bowel obstruction<ref name=AHFS/>  and in epilepsy, if a stomach operation has been performed in the previous three or four days, if the person has ever had bleeding, perforation or blockage of the stomach, in cases of pheochromocytoma, and in newborn babies.<ref name="xpil.medicines.org.uk"/>

People with a history of [[ADHD]], [[restless legs syndrome]], [[hyperprolactinaemia]], and Parkinson's disease should be closely monitored when using [[dopamine antagonist]]s for treatment of emesis. People who take [[antipsychotic]]s are recommended not to take metoclopramide.

The safety of the drug was reviewed by the [[European Medicines Agency]] in 2011, which determined that it should not be prescribed in high doses, for periods of more than five days, or given to children below 1 year of age. They suggested its use in older children should be restricted to treating post-chemotherapy or post-surgery nausea and vomiting, and even then only for patients where other treatments have failed. For adults, they recommended its use be restricted to treating migraines and post-chemotherapy or post-surgery patients.<ref>EMA.

==Mechanism of action==
It appears to bind to [[dopamine receptor|dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors]] with nanomolar affinity (Ki 28.8 nM),<ref>Prediction of Catalepsies Induced by Amiodarone, Aprindine and Procaine: Similarity in Conformation of Diethylaminoethyl Side Chain http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/287/2/725.full.pdf</ref> where it is a [[receptor antagonist]], and is also a mixed [[5-HT3 receptor|5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor]] antagonist/[[5-HT4 receptor|5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor]] agonist.

The antiemetic action of metoclopramide is due to its antagonist activity at D<sub>2</sub> receptors in the [[chemoreceptor trigger zone]] <!-- (CTZ) --> in the [[central nervous system]] <!-- (CNS) -->— this action prevents nausea and vomiting triggered by most stimuli.<ref name=Rang2003>

At higher doses, 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonist activity may also contribute to the antiemetic effect.<ref name=Fischer/>

The gastroprokinetic activity of metoclopramide is mediated by [[muscarinic]] activity, D<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonist activity and 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor agonist activity.<ref name=Sweetman2004>

It increases [[peristalsis]] of the [[duodenum]] and [[jejunum]], increases tone and amplitude of [[Segmentation contractions|gastric contractions]], and relaxes the [[Pylorus|pyloric sphincter]] and [[duodenal bulb]], while simultaneously increasing [[lower esophageal sphincter]] tone. These gastroprokinetic effects make metoclopramide useful in the treatment of gastric [[Stasis (medicine)|stasis]] (for example: after gastric surgery or diabetic [[gastroparesis]]), as an aid in gastrointestinal [[Medical radiography|radiographic studies]] by accelerating transit through the gastrointestinal system in barium studies, and as an aid in difficult intubation of the small intestine.

The drugs were initially used to control nausea for people with severe headaches or migraines, and later uses for nausea caused by radiation therapy and chemotherapy, and later yet for treating nausea caused by anesthesia.<ref name=Henzi/>  In the US the injectable form was labelled for chemotherapy-induced nausea and the oral form was eventually labelled for [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]].<ref name=Pink1986/>

It became widely used in the 1980s, becoming the most commonly used drug to treat anesthesia-induced nausea<ref name=Henzi/> and for treating [[gastritis]] in emergency rooms.<ref>Staff, Emergency Physician Monthly.

In the early 1980s signs began to emerge in pharmacovigilance studies from Sweden that the drug was causing [[tardive dyskinesia]] in some patients.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/288/6416/545.full.pdf | pmid = 6421373 | pmc=1444584 | volume=288 | title=Tardive dyskinesia associated with metoclopramide | year=1984 | journal=Br Med J (Clin Res Ed) | pages=545–7 | last1 = Wiholm | first1 = BE | last2 = Mortimer | first2 = O | last3 = Boethius | first3 = G | last4 = Häggström | first4 = JE | doi=10.1136/bmj.288.6416.545}}</ref>  The FDA required a warning about tardive dyskinesia to be added to the drug label in 1985 stating that: "tardive dyskinesia . . . may develop in patients treated with metoclopramide,” and warned against use longer than 12 weeks, as that was how long the drug has been tested.<ref>Allison Stoddart, [http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/bclr/vol53/iss5/9 Missing After Mensing: A Remedy for Generic Drug Consumers], 53 B.C.L.

The emergence of this severe side effect led to a wave of product liability litigation against generic manufacturers as well as Wyeth.<ref name=Noah>Lars Noah [http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/tort_insurance_law_journal/tips_vol45_no3_4_Noah.authcheckdam.pdf Adding Insult to Injury: Paying For Harms Caused by a Competitor’s Copycat Product] Tort Trial & Insurance Practice Law Journal, Spring/Summer 2010 (45:3-4)</ref>    The litigation was complicated since there was a lack of clarity in jurisdiction between state laws, where product liability is determined, and federal law, which determines how drugs are labelled, as well as between generics companies, which had no control over labelling, and the originator company, which did.<ref name=Noah/><ref name=Pepper>Eric Rothschild for Pepper Hamilton LLP's Insight Center.

Wyeth in the California state courts, the claims of the plaintiff against the generic companies Pliva, Teva, and Purepac that had sold the drugs that the plaintiff actually took, and the claims against Wyeth, whose product the plaintiff never took, were all dismissed by the trial court, but the case was appealed, and in 2008 the appellate court upheld the dismissal of the cases against the generic companies, but reversed on Wyeth, allowing the case against Wyeth to proceed.<ref name=Noah/><ref name=Pepper/><ref>[http://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1114587.html Conte v.

Shortly following the Pliva decision, the FDA proposed a rule change that would allow generics manufacturers to update the label if the originating drug had been withdrawn from the market for reasons other than safety.<ref>Staff, Today.
