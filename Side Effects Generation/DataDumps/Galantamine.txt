'''Galantamine''' ('''Nivalin''', '''Razadyne''', '''Razadyne ER''', '''Reminyl''', '''Lycoremine''') is used for the treatment of mild to moderate [[Alzheimer's disease]] and various other [[memory]] impairments, in particular those of [[vascular]] origin. It is an [[alkaloid]] that has been isolated from the bulbs and flowers of ''Galanthus caucasicus'' (Caucasian [[snowdrop]]), ''[[Galanthus woronowii]]'' (Voronov's snowdrop), and some other members of the family ''[[Amaryllidaceae]]'' such as ''Narcissus'' ([[daffodil]]), ''[[Leucojum aestivum]]'' (snowflake), and ''Lycoris'' including ''[[Lycoris radiata]]'' (red spider lily).<ref>[http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/publications/nnfcc-project-factsheet-sustainable-production-of-the-natural-product-galanthamine-defra-nf0612 NNFCC Project Factsheet: Sustainable Production of the Natural Product Galanthamine (Defra), NF0612]</ref>  It can also be [[Galantamine total synthesis|produced synthetically]].

Studies of usage in modern [[medicine]] began in the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1950s. The active ingredient was extracted, identified, and studied, in particular in relation to its [[acetylcholinesterase]] (AChE)-inhibiting properties. The bulk of the work was carried out by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] pharmacologists [[Mikhail Davidovich Mashkovsky|M. D. Mashkovsky]] and R. P. Kruglikova–Lvova, beginning in 1951.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Snowdrops: The heralds of spring and a modern drug for Alzheimer's disease | last1=Heinrich | first1=M. | journal=Pharmaceutical Journal | year=2004 | volume=273 | issue=7330 | pages=905–6 |oclc=98892008 |url=http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/pj-online-christmas-2004-snowdrops-the-heralds-of-spring-and-a-modern-drug-for-alzheimer8217s-disease/20013614.article }}</ref> The work of Mashkovsky and Kruglikova-Lvova was the first published work that demonstrated the AChE-inhibiting properties of galantamine.<ref>{{cite journal | title=On the pharmacology of the new alkaloid galantamine | last1=Mashkovsky | first1=MD | last2=Kruglikova–Lvova | first2=RP | journal=Farmakologia Toxicologia | year=1951 | volume=14 | pages=27–30 }}</ref>

The first industrial process was developed in [[Bulgaria]] by [[Dimitar Paskov|prof. Paskov]] in 1959 ([[Nivalin]], [[Sopharma]]) from a species traditionally used as a popular medicine in [[Eastern Europe]], and, thus, the idea for developing a medicine from these species seems to be based on the local use (i.e., an [[ethnobotany]]-driven drug discovery).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Heinrich | first1 = M. | last2 = Teoh | first2 = H.L. | year = 2004 | title = Galanthamine from snowdrop – the development of a modern drug against Alzheimer's disease from local Caucasian knowledge | url = | journal = Journal of Ethnopharmacology | pmid = 15137996 | volume = 92 | issue = 2–3| pages = 147–162 | doi = 10.1016/j.jep.2004.02.012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Scott | first1 = LJ | last2 = Goa | first2 = KL | title = Galantamine: a review of its use in Alzheimer's disease | journal = Drugs | volume = 60 | issue = 5 | pages = 1095–122 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11129124 | doi=10.2165/00003495-200060050-00008}}</ref>

In addition to uses in Alzheimer's disease, galantamine has been used to treat [[myasthenia gravis|myasthenia]], [[myopathy]], [[muscular dystrophy]], and sensory and motor dysfunction associated with disorders of the central nervous system. Research has indicated that galantamine may prove useful both in the treatment of organophosphate poisoning and in the treatment of autism in children and adolescents.

==Uses in mythology==
In [[Homer|Homer's]] ''[[Odyssey]]'' the god [[Hermes]] gives Odysseus an herb with "a black root, but milklike flower" called "moly", which Hermes claims will make Odysseus immune to the sorceress Cerce's drugs.

===Alzheimer's disease===
Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the impairment of [[cholinergic]] function. One hypothesis is that this impairment contributes to the cognitive deficits caused by the disease. This hypothesis forms the basis for galantamine's use as a cholinergic enhancer in the treatment of Alzheimer's. Galantamine completely inhibits acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme which [[Hydrolysis|hydrolyzes]] acetylcholine. As a result of acetylcholinesterase inhibition, galantamine increases the availability of acetylcholine for synaptic transmission.<ref name = "neurology">{{cite journal|author = Raskind, M.A.; Peskind, E.R.; Wessel, T.; Yuan, W.|title=Galantamine in AD|journal=Neurology|date=June 27, 2000|volume=54|issue=12|pages=2261–2268|url=http://www.neurology.org/content/54/12/2261.full|accessdate=21 April 2017}}</ref> Additionally, galantamine binds to the [[allosteric regulation|allosteric]] sites of [[nicotinic]] receptors, which causes a conformational change.<ref name="springer">Farlow, M.R.

=== Available forms ===
The product is supplied in both a prescription form as well as an over the counter supplement in twice-a-day tablets, in once-a-day extended-release capsules, and in oral solution.

== Side effects ==
Galantamine's [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]] profile was very similar to that of other cholinesterase inhibitors, with [[gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] symptoms being the most notable and most commonly observed. One study reports higher proportions of patients treated with galantamine experiencing nausea and vomiting as opposed to the placebo group.<ref name="direct" /> Another study using a dose-escalation treatment has found that incidences of nausea would decrease to baseline levels soon after each increase in administered dosage.<ref name="springer" /> In practice, some other cholinesterase inhibitors might be better tolerated; however, a careful and gradual titration over more than three months may lead to equivalent long-term tolerability.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Birks | first1 = J | last2 = Birks | first2 = Jacqueline | title = Cholinesterase inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease | journal = Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) | issue = 1 | pages = CD005593 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16437532 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005593 | editor1-last = Birks | editor1-first = Jacqueline }}</ref>

== Pharmacology ==
Galantamine's chemical structure contains a tertiary amine. At a neutral pH, this tertiary amine will often bond to a hydrogen, and appear mostly as an ammonium ion.<ref name="cronin" />

Galantamine is a potent [[Allosteric modulator|allosteric]] potentiating [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] of human [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptors]] (nAChRs) [[Α4β2 nicotinic receptor|α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>2</sub>]], [[Α3β4 nicotinic receptor|α<sub>3</sub>β<sub>4</sub>]], and [[α6β4|α<sub>6</sub>β<sub>4</sub>]], and chicken/mouse nAChRs [[Α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor|α<sub>7</sub>]]/[[5-HT3 receptor|5-HT<sub>3</sub>]] in certain areas of the brain.<ref name="nicotinic receptor">{{cite journal |first1=Marek |last1=Samochocki |first2=Anja |last2=Höffle |first3=Andreas |last3=Fehrenbacher |first4=Ruth |last4=Jostock |first5=Jürgen |last5=Ludwig |first6=Claudia |last6=Christner |first7=Martin |last7=Radina |first8=Marion |last8=Zerlin |first9=Christoph |last9=Ullmer |first10=Edna F.

Galantamine in its pure form is a white powder. The atomic resolution 3D structure of the complex of galantamine and its target, acetylcholinesterase, was determined by [[X-ray crystallography]] in 1999 (PDB code: [http://oca.weizmann.ac.il/oca-bin/ocashort?id=1DX6 1DX6]; [http://www.proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/1dx6 see complex]).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenblatt |first1=H.M. |last2=Kryger |first2=G. |last3=Lewis |first3=T. |last4=Silman |first4=I. |last5=Sussman |first5=J.L. |title=Structure of acetylcholinesterase complexed with (−)-galanthamine at 2.3 Å resolution |journal=FEBS Letters |volume=463 |issue=3 |pages=321–6 |year=1999 |pmid=10606746 |doi=10.1016/S0014-5793(99)01637-3 }}</ref> There is no evidence that galantamine alters the course of the underlying dementing process.<ref>[http://www.ortho-mcneilneurologics.com/ortho-mcneilneurologics/shared/pi/razadyne.pdf Ortho-McNeil Neurologics, "Razadyne ER US Product Insert", May 2006]</ref>

== Pharmacokinetics ==

Absorption of galantamine is rapid and complete and shows linear pharmacokinetics.  It is well absorbed with absolute oral [[bioavailability]] between 80 and 100%. It has a [[elimination half-life|half-life]] of seven hours. Peak effect of inhibiting [[acetylcholinesterase]] was achieved about one hour after a single oral dose of 8&nbsp;mg in some healthy volunteers.

The coadministration of food delays the rate of galantamine absorption, but does not affect the extent of absorption.<ref name="springer" />

[[Plasma protein binding]] of galantamine is about 18%, which is relatively low.

== Metabolism ==

Approximately 75% of a dose of galantamine is metabolised in the liver. In vitro studies have shown that Hepatic [[CYP2D6]] and [[CYP3A4]] are involved in galantamine metabolism. Within 24 hours of intravenous or oral administration approximately 20% of a dose of galantamine will be excreted unreacted in the urine.<ref name="springer" />

In humans, several metabolic pathways for galantamine exist.<ref name="metabolism">G. S. J. Mannens, C. A. W. Snel, J. Hendrickx, T. Verhaeghe, L. Le Jeune, W. Bode, L. van Beijsterveldt, K. Lavrijsen, J. Leempoels, N. Van Osselaer, A. Van Peer and W. Meuldermans. The Metabolism and Excretion of Galantamine in Rats, Dogs, and Humans. Drug Metabolism and Disposition May 1, 2002, 30 (5) 553-563; DOI: https://doi.org/10.1124/dmd.30.5.553</ref> These pathways lead to the formation of a number of different metabolites.<ref name="metabolism" /> One of the metabolites that may result can be formed through the [[glucuronidation]] of galantamine.<ref name="metabolism" /> Additionally, galantamine may undergo [[oxidation]] or [[demethylation]] at its nitrogen atom, forming two other possible metabolites.<ref name="metabolism" /> Galantamine can undergo demethylation at its oxygen atom, forming an intermediate which can then undergo glucuronidation or sulfate conjugation.<ref name="metabolism" /> Lastly, galantamine may be oxidized and then reduced before finally undergoing demethylation or oxidation at its nitrogen atom, or demethylation and subsequent glucuronidation at its oxygen atom.<ref name="metabolism" />

[[File:Galantamine Metabolism.png|thumb|center|Metabolic pathways of galantamine]]

For Razadyne ER, the once-a-day formulation, CYP2D6 [[poor metabolizer]]s had drug exposures that were approximately 50% higher than for extensive metabolizers. About 7% of the population has this genetic mutation; however, because the drug is individually titrated to tolerability, no specific dosage adjustment is necessary for this population.

==Drug interactions==
Since galantamine in metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, inhibiting either of these [[isoenzymes]] will increase the cholinergic effects of galantamine.<ref name="springer" /> Inhibiting these enzymes may lead to adverse effects.<ref name="springer" /> It was found that [[paroxetine]], an inhibitor of CYP2D6, increased the [[bioavailability]] of galantamine by 40%.<ref name="springer" /> The CYP3A4 inhibitors ketoconazole and [[erythromycin]] increased the [[bioavailability]] of galantamine by 30% and 12%, respectively.<ref name="springer" />

== Synthesis ==

{{main article|Galantamine total synthesis}}

Galantamine is produced from natural resources and a patented [[total synthesis]] process. Many other synthetic methods exist but have not been implemented on an industrial scale.

==Research==

===Organophosphate poisoning===
The toxicity of [[organophosphate]]s results primarily from their action as irreversible inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase.<ref name = "organo" /> Inhibiting acetylcholinesterase causes an increase in acetylcholine, as the enzyme is no longer available to catalyze its breakdown.<ref name = "organo" /> In the peripheral nervous system, acetylcholine accumulation can cause an overstimulation of muscarinic receptors followed by a desensitization of nicotinic receptors.<ref name = "organo" /> This leads to severe skeletal muscle fasciculations (involuntary contractions).<ref name = "organo" /> The effects on the central nervous system include [[anxiety]], restlessness, [[confusion]], [[ataxia]], [[tremor]]s, [[seizures]], cardiorespiratory paralysis, and [[coma]].<ref name = "organo" /> As a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, galantamine has the potential to serve as an effective organophosphate poisoning treatment by preventing irreversible acetylcholinesterase inhibition.<ref name = "organo" /> Additionally, galantamine has [[anticonvulsant]] properties which may make it even more desirable as an antidote.<ref name = "organo" />

Research supported in part by the [[US Army]] has led to a [[US patent]] application for the use of galantamine and/or its derivatives for treatment of [[organophosphate poisoning]]. The indications for use of galantamine in the patent application include poisoning by [[nerve agent]]s "including but not limited to [[soman]], [[sarin]], and [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]], [[tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]], and [[Novichok agent]]s".  Galantamine was studied in the research cited in the patent application for use along with the well-recognized nerve agent antidote [[atropine]].  According to the investigators, an unexpected synergistic interaction occurred between galantamine and atropine in an amount of 6&nbsp;mg/kg or higher. Increasing the dose of galantamine from 5 to 8&nbsp;mg/kg decreased the dose of atropine needed to protect experimental animals from the toxicity of soman in dosages 1.5.times the dose generally required to kill half the experimental animals.<ref name="Albuquerque_patent">{{cite web|url=http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&d=PG01&s1=20090023706.PN.&OS=PN/20090023706&RS=PN/20090023706 |title=United States Patent Application 20090023706 |publisher=US Patent and Trademark Office |date=January 22, 2009 |accessdate=27 May 2016 |authors=Albuquerque, Edson X; Adler, Michael; Pereira, Edna F.R. }}</ref>

===Autism===
Galantamine given in addition to [[risperidone]] to autistic children has been shown to improve some of the symptoms of autism such as irritability, lethargy, and social withdrawal.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 24132248| year = 2013| author1 = Ghaleiha| first1 = A| title = Galantamine efficacy and tolerability as an augmentative therapy in autistic children: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial| journal = Journal of Psychopharmacology| volume = 28| issue = 7| pages = 677–685| last2 = Ghyasvand| first2 = M| last3 = Mohammadi| first3 = M.

===Anesthesia===
Galantamine may have some limited use in reducing the side-effects of anesthetics [[ketalar]] and [[diazepam]]. In one study, a control group of patients were given [[ketalar]] and [[diazepam]] and underwent [[anesthesia]] and surgery.<ref name="anesth">{{cite journal|author=Chakalova E, Marinova M, Srebreva M, Anastasov D, Ploskov K.|title=Attempt to eliminate residual somnolence and disorientation with nivaline after anesthesia with ketalar and diazepam for minor obstetrical and gynecologic surgery|journal=Akush Ginekol (Sofiia)|date=1987|volume=26|issue=3|pages=28–31|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3631427|accessdate=22 April 2017}}</ref> The experimental group was given [[ketalar]], [[diazepam]], and nivalin (of which the active ingredient is galantamine).<ref name="anesth" /> The degree of drowsiness and disorientation of the two groups was then assessed 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes after surgery.<ref name="anesth" /> The group that had taken nivalin were found to be more alert 5, 10, and 15 minutes after the surgery.<ref name="anesth" />
