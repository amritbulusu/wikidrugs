'''Flucloxacillin''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) or '''floxacillin''' ([[United States Approved Name|USAN]]) is a [[broad-spectrum antibiotic|narrow-spectrum]] [[beta-lactam antibiotic]] of the [[penicillin]] class. It is used to treat infections caused by susceptible [[Gram-positive]] [[bacteria]]. Unlike other penicillins, flucloxacillin has activity against [[beta-lactamase]]-producing organisms such as ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''<ref name="pmid5481218">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sutherland R, Croydon EA, Rolinson GN |title=Flucloxacillin, a new isoxazolyl penicillin, compared with oxacillin, cloxacillin, and dicloxacillin |journal=Br Med J |volume=4 |issue=5733 |pages=455–60 |date=November 1970 |pmid=5481218 |pmc=1820086 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.4.5733.455|url=}}</ref> as it is beta-lactamase stable. However, it is ineffective against [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus]] (MRSA).<ref>[http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/mrsa/documents/rcn%20mrsa%20guidelines.pdf NHS: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) - Guidance for nursing staff] "methicillin resistance means the same as flucloxacillin resistance"</ref> It is very similar to [[dicloxacillin]]; they are considered interchangeable. While no longer used in the United States, Flucloxacillin is supplied under a variety of trade names in other countries, including Floxapen ([[Beecham (pharmaceutical company)|Beecham]], now [[GlaxoSmithKline|GSK]]), Flopen ([[CSL Limited|CSL]]), Staphylex ([[Alphapharm]]), Softapen (Rephco Pharmaceuticals Limited), Flubex (Beximco Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Bangladesh), and Flupen (for state use only in South Africa).

==Overview of common uses==
It is most commonly used to treat infections.
*Chest, ear, nose and throat (e.g. tonsillitis, sinusitis, pneumonia)
*Skin and soft tissue (e.g. boils, burns, wounds, abscesses, infected eczema, infected acne)
*Other infections including those of the heart (endocarditis), bones and joints (osteomyelitis), membranes of the brain (meningitis), guts (enteritis), blood (septicaemia), and the kidney, bladder or urethra

Flucloxacillin can also be used to prevent infections during major surgical procedures, particularly in heart or orthopedic surgery.

==Mechanism of action==
{{main article|Beta-lactam antibiotic}}
Like other β-lactam antibiotics, flucloxacillin <!-- ('''fluclox''') --> acts by inhibiting the synthesis of bacterial [[cell wall]]s. It inhibits cross-linkage between the linear [[peptidoglycan]] polymer chains that make up a major component of the cell wall of [[Gram-positive]] bacteria.

==Medicinal chemistry==
Flucloxacillin is insensitive to [[beta-lactamase]] (also known as penicillinase) enzymes secreted by many penicillin-resistant bacteria. The presence of the [[isoxazole|isoxazolyl]] group on the [[side chain]] of the penicillin nucleus facilitates the β-lactamase  resistance, since they are relatively intolerant of side chain [[steric hindrance]]. Thus, it is able to bind to [[penicillin-binding protein]]s and inhibit peptidoglycan crosslinking, but is not bound by or inactivated by β-lactamases.

==Clinical use==
Flucloxacillin is more acid-stable than many other penicillins and can be given orally, in addition to [[parenteral]] routes. However, like [[methicillin]], it is less potent than [[benzylpenicillin]] against non-β-lactamase-producing Gram-positive bacteria.

Flucloxacillin has similar [[pharmacokinetics]], antibacterial activity, and indications to dicloxacillin, and the two agents are considered interchangeable. It is reported to have higher, though rare, incidence of severe hepatic [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]] than dicloxacillin,<ref>[http://livertox.nih.gov/Penicillins.htm US National Library of Medicine: Livertox. PENICILLINASE-RESISTANT PENICILLINS, SECOND-GENERATION PENICILLINS]</ref> but a lower incidence of renal adverse effects.<ref name="AMH2006">Rossi S, editor. [[Australian Medicines Handbook]] 2006. Adelaide: Australian Medicines Handbook; 2006.</ref>

===Available forms===
Flucloxacillin is commercially available as the sodium salt flucloxacillin sodium, in [[Tablet (pharmacy)|capsules]] (250 or 500&nbsp;mg), oral [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]]s (125&nbsp;mg/5&nbsp;ml or 250&nbsp;mg/5&nbsp;ml), and injections (powder for reconstitution, 250, 500 and 1000&nbsp;mg per vial).

===Indications===
Flucloxacillin is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible bacteria. Specific approved indications include:<ref name="AMH2006" /><ref name="BNF50">Joint Formulary Committee. [[British National Formulary]], 50th edition. London: British Medical Association and Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain; 2005.</ref>
*[[Staphylococcus|Staphylococcal skin infections]] and [[cellulitis]]&nbsp;– including [[impetigo]], [[otitis externa]], [[folliculitis]], [[boil]]s, [[carbuncles]], and [[mastitis]]
*[[Pneumonia]] (adjunct)
*[[Osteomyelitis]], [[septic arthritis]]
*[[Septicaemia]]
*[[Empirical treatment]] for [[endocarditis]]
*Surgical [[prophylaxis]]

Contrary to common belief, Flucloxacillin has good activity against non-β-lactamase-producing bacteria including ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]''.<ref>[http://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/streptococcal-skin-infections/ DermNet NZ: Streptococcal skin infections]</ref> Due to this widespread belief, empirical therapy for significant cellulitis often involves dual-therapy to cover both [[Staphylococcus|staphylococci]] and [[Streptococcus|streptococci]], however this has not shown to be of clinical benefit.<ref>[http://emj.bmj.com/content/22/5/342.full Flucloxacillin alone or combined with benzylpenicillin to treat lower limb cellulitis: a randomised controlled trial]</ref>

===Precautions/contraindications===
Flucloxacillin is contraindicated in those with a previous history of allergy to penicillins, [[cephalosporin]]s, or [[carbapenem]]s. It should also not be used in the eye, or administered to those with a history of [[cholestasis|cholestatic hepatitis]] associated with the use of dicloxacillin or flucloxacillin.<ref name="AMH2006" />

It should be used with caution in the elderly, patients with renal impairment where a reduced dose is required, and those with hepatic impairment, due to the risk of cholestatic hepatitis.<ref name="AMH2006" />

It should be taken on an empty stomach, one half to one hour before food, as absorption is reduced when taken with food. [http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/Consumers/CMI/f/flucloxacillin-aft.pdf]

==Adverse effects==
Common [[adverse drug reaction]]s associated with the use of flucloxacillin include: [[diarrhoea]], [[nausea]], [[rash]], [[urticaria]], [[pain]] and [[inflammation]] at injection site, [[superinfection]] (including [[candidiasis]]), [[allergy]], and transient increases in liver enzymes and bilirubin.<ref name="AMH2006" /> Rarely, [[cholestasis|cholestatic jaundice]] (also referred to as cholestatic hepatitis) has been associated with flucloxacillin therapy. The reaction may occur up to several weeks after treatment has stopped, and takes weeks to resolve. The estimated incidence is one in 15,000 exposures, and is more frequent in people >55 years, females, and those with treatment longer than two weeks.<ref name="AMH2006" /><ref name="BNF50" />

==Resistance==
Despite flucloxacillin being insensitive to beta-lactamases, some organisms have developed resistance to it and other narrow-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics including methicillin. Such organisms include [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']], which has developed resistance to flucloxacillin and other penicillins by having an altered penicillin-binding protein.
