[[File:Dexamethasone.jpg|thumb|Dexamethasone]]

===Anti-inflammatory===
Dexamethasone is used to treat many [[inflammation|inflammatory]] and [[autoimmune disease|autoimmune]] conditions, such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[bronchospasm]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Till|first=John|title=Paramedic Clinical Training Aid|url=http://paramedic-info.com/PDA/index.html|accessdate=30 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331110331/http://paramedic-info.com/PDA/index.html|archivedate=31 March 2012|df=}}</ref> [[Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura]], a decrease in numbers of [[platelet]]s due to an immune problem, responds to 40&nbsp;mg daily for four days; it may be administered in 14-day cycles. It is unclear whether dexamethasone in this condition is significantly better than other glucocorticoids.<ref name="pmid19846889">{{cite journal |vauthors=Provan D, Stasi R, Newland AC, Blanchette VS, Bolton-Maggs P, Bussel JB, Chong BH, Cines DB, Gernsheimer TB, Godeau B, Grainger J, Greer I, Hunt BJ, Imbach PA, Lyons G, McMillan R, Rodeghiero F, Sanz MA, Tarantino M, Watson S, Young J, Kuter DJ | title = International consensus report on the investigation and management of primary immune thrombocytopenia | journal = Blood | volume = 115 | issue = 2 |pages = 168–86 |date=January 2010 | pmid = 19846889 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2009-06-225565 }}</ref>

It is also given in small amounts<ref name="pmid8491244">{{cite journal | author1 = Schmelzeisen R |author2= Frölich Janice C. | title = Prevention of postoperative swelling and pain by dexamethasone after operative removal of impacted third molar teeth | journal = Eur.

Dexamethasone is commonly given as a treatment for [[croup]] in children, as a single dose can reduce the swelling of the airway to improve breathing and reduce discomfort.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/croup/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350354 |title=Croup- Diagnosis & Treatment |website=Mayo Clinic |access-date=13 October 2017 |quote="Dexamethasone is usually recommended because of its long-lasting effects (up to 72 hours)."}}</ref>

It is injected into the heel when treating [[plantar fasciitis]], sometimes in conjunction with [[triamcinolone acetonide]].

It is useful to counteract [[anaphylaxis|allergic anaphylactic shock]], if given in high doses.

It is present in certain [[eye drops]] – particularly after [[eye surgery]] – and as a [[nasal spray]] (trade name Dexacort), and certain ear drops ([[Sofradex]], when combined with an antibiotic and an antifungal). Dexamethasone intravitreal steroid implants (trade name Ozurdex) have been approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]  to treat ocular conditions such as [[diabetic retinopathy|diabetic macular edema]], [[central retinal vein occlusion]], and [[uveitis]].<ref name="Brady">{{cite journal |vauthors=Brady CJ, Villanti AC, Law HA, Rahimy E, Reddy R, Sieving PC, Garg SJ, Tang J |title= Corticosteroid implants for chronic non-infectious uveitis |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume=2 |pages= CD010469 |date=2016 |pmid= 26866343 |doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD010469.pub2}}</ref> Dexamethasone has also been used with antibiotics to treat acute [[endophthalmitis]].<ref name="Kim">{{cite journal |author=Kim CH, Chen MF, Coleman AL |title= Adjunctive steroid therapy versus antibiotics alone for acute endophthalmitis |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume= |issue=2|pages= CD012131 |date=2017 |pmid= 28225198|doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD012121.pub2}}</ref>

Dexamethasone is used in transvenous screw-in [[artificial pacemaker|cardiac pacing leads]] to minimize the inflammatory response of the [[myocardium]]. The steroid is released into the myocardium as soon as the screw is extended and can play a significant role in minimizing the acute pacing threshold due to the reduction of inflammatory response. The typical quantity present in a lead tip is less than 1.0&nbsp;mg.

Dexamethasone may be administered before antibiotics in cases of [[bacterial meningitis]]. It acts to reduce the inflammatory response of the body to the bacteria killed by the antibiotics (bacterial death releases proinflammatory mediators that can cause a response which is harmful), thus reducing hearing loss and neurological damage.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brouwer|first=Matthijs C.|last2=McIntyre|first2=Peter|last3=de Gans|first3=Jan|last4=Prasad|first4=Kameshwar|last5=van de Beek|first5=Diederik|date=2010-09-08|title=Corticosteroids for acute bacterial meningitis|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=9|pages=CD004405|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004405.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=20824838}}</ref>

===Cancer===
People with [[cancer]] undergoing [[chemotherapy]] are often given dexamethasone to counteract certain [[Adverse drug reaction|side effects]] of their antitumor treatments. Dexamethasone can increase the [[antiemetic]] effect of [[5-HT3 antagonist|5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists]], such as [[ondansetron]].<ref name="PMID10824073">{{cite journal |vauthors=Roila F, Ballatori E, Ruggeri B, DeAngelis V | title = Dexamethasone Alone or in Combination with Ondansetron for the Prevention of Delayed Nausea and Vomiting Induced by Chemotherapy | journal = N Engl J Med |volume = 342 | issue = 21 | pages = 1554–9 |date=May 2000 | pmid = 10824073 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200005253422102 }}</ref> The exact mechanism of this interaction is not well-defined, but it has been theorized that this effect may be due to, among many other causes, inhibition of [[prostaglandin]] synthesis, [[antiinflammatory|anti-inflammatory]] effects, [[immunosuppression|immunosuppressive]] effects, decreased release of [[endogenous]] [[opioid]]s, or a combination of the aforementioned.<ref name="PMID12437261">{{cite journal |vauthors=Holte K, Kehlet H | title = Perioperative single-dose glucocorticoid administration: pathophysiologic effects and clinical implications | journal = J Am Coll Surg |volume = 195 | issue = 5 | pages = 694–712 |date=Nov 2002 | pmid = 12437261 | doi = 10.1016/s1072-7515(02)01491-6}}</ref>

In [[brain tumor]]s (primary or metastatic), dexamethasone is used to counteract the development of [[edema]], which could eventually compress other brain structures. It is also given in [[Spinal cord compression|cord compression]], where a tumor is compressing the spinal cord.

Dexamethasone is also used as a direct chemotherapeutic agent in certain [[hematological malignancy|haematological malignancies]], especially in the treatment of [[multiple myeloma]], in which dexamethasone is given alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs, including most commonly with [[thalidomide]] (Thal-dex), [[lenalidomide]], [[bortezomib]] (Velcade, Vel-dex),<ref name="pmid17043025">{{cite journal |vauthors=Harousseau JL, Attal M, Leleu X, Troncy J, Pegourie B, Stoppa AM, Hulin C, Benboubker L, Fuzibet JG, Renaud M, Moreau P, Avet-Loiseau H | title = Bortezomib plus dexamethasone as induction treatment prior to autologous stem cell transplantation in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: results of an IFM phase II study | journal = Haematologica |volume = 91 | issue = 11 | pages = 1498–505 |date=November 2006 | pmid = 17043025 | doi = }}</ref> or a combination of [[doxorubicin]] (Adriamycin) and [[vincristine]] or [[bortezomib]]/[[lenalidomide]]/dexamethasone.

In [[adrenal insufficiency]] and [[Addison's disease]], dexamethasone is prescribed when the patient does not respond well to [[prednisone]] or [[methylprednisolone]].

It can be used in [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] in older adolescents and adults to suppress ACTH production. It is typically given at night.<ref>Dan L. Longo, Anthony Fauci, Dennis Kasper, Stephen Hauser, J. Jerry Jameson and Joseph Loscalzo, Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 18th edition, p.3055</ref>

===Pregnancy===
Dexamethasone may be given to women at risk of delivering prematurely to promote [[Respiratory system#Development|maturation]] of the fetus' lungs. This has been associated with [[low birth weight]], although not with increased rates of neonatal death.<ref name="pmid11275014">{{cite journal |vauthors=Bloom SL, Sheffield JS, McIntire DD, Leveno KJ | title = Antenatal dexamethasone and decreased birth weight | journal = Obstet Gynecol | volume = 97 | issue = 4 | pages = 485–90 |date=April 2001 | pmid = 11275014 | doi = 10.1016/S0029-7844(00)01206-0 }}</ref>

Dexamethasone has also been used during pregnancy as an [[off-label]] prenatal treatment for the symptoms of [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH) in female fetuses. CAH causes a variety of physical abnormalities, notably [[Intersex|ambiguous genitalia]] in girls. Early prenatal CAH treatment has been shown to reduce some CAH symptoms, but it does not treat the underlying [[congenital disorder]]. This use is controversial: it is inadequately studied, only around one in ten of the foetuses of women treated are at risk of the condition, and serious adverse events have been documented.<ref>[http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1996453,00.html Time] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160831150342/http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1996453,00.html |date=2016-08-31 }}</ref> Experimental use of dexamethasone in pregnancy for foetal CAH treatment was discontinued in Sweden when one in five cases suffered adverse events.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hirvikoski|first1=Tatja|last2=Nordenström|first2=Anna|last3=Wedell|first3=Anna|last4=Ritzén|first4=Martin|last5=Lajic|first5=Svetlana|title=Prenatal Dexamethasone Treatment of Children at Risk for Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia: The Swedish Experience and Standpoint|journal=The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism|date=June 2012|volume=97|issue=6|pages=1881–1883|doi=10.1210/jc.2012-1222}}</ref>

A small clinical trial found long-term effects on verbal working memory among the small group of children treated prenatally, but the small number of test subjects means the study cannot be considered definitive.<ref name="Hirvikoski_2007">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hirvikoski T, Nordenström A, Lindholm T, Lindblad F, Ritzén EM, Wedell A, Lajic S | title = Cognitive functions in children at risk for congenital adrenal hyperplasia treated prenatally with dexamethasone | journal = J.

==Pharmacology==
As a glucocorticoid, dexamethasone is an [[agonist]] of the [[glucocorticoid receptor]] (GR).

==Chemistry==
Dexamethasone is a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]] [[pregnane]] [[corticosteroid]] and [[chemical derivative|derivative]] of [[cortisol]] (hydrocortisone) and is also known as 1-dehydro-9α-fluoro-16α-methylhydrocortisone or as 9α-fluoro-11β,17α,21-trihydroxy-16α-methylpregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione.<ref name="Elks2014">{{cite book|author=J.

===Synthesis===
To synthesize dexamethasone, 16β-methylprednisolone acetate is [[dehydration reaction|dehydrated]] to the 9,11-dehydro [[derivative (chemistry)|derivative]]. This is then reacted with a source of [[hypobromite]], such as basic [[N-Bromosuccinimide|''N''-bromosuccinimide]], to form the 9α-bromo-11β-hydrin derivative, which is then ring-closed to an epoxide. A ring-opening reaction with [[hydrogen fluoride]] in [[tetrahydrofuran]] gives dexamethasone.

===Cost===
Dexamethasone is not expensive.<ref name=WHODex/> In the United States a month of medication typically costs less than 25 USD.<ref name=AHFS2015/> In India a course of treatment for preterm labor is about 0.5 USD.<ref name=WHODex/> It is available in most areas of the world.<ref name=WHODex/>

===Nonmedical use===
Dexamethasone is given in legal Bangladeshi brothels to prostitutes not yet of legal age, causing weight gain aimed at making them appear healthier and older to customers and police.<ref name="BBC_News_2010-05-30">{{Citation |last=Dummett |first=Mark |date=2010-05-30 |title=Bangladesh's dark brothel steroid secret |journal=BBC News |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10173115 |postscript=. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222194217/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10173115 |archivedate=2012-02-22 |df= }}</ref>

Dexamethasone is a banned substance by some sporting bodies. In November 2014, the world's number one badminton player [[Lee Chong Wei]]  was banned by the [[Badminton World Federation]] for testing positive for the drug, although he denied using any banned substances.<ref name="BBC_News_2014_11_12">{{Citation |last=Dummett |first=Mark |date=2014-11-12 |title=Lee Chong Wei: Badminton star suspended for 'apparent' doping |journal=BBC News |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/badminton/30001775 |postscript=. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112141830/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/badminton/30001775 |archivedate=2014-11-12 |df= }}</ref>
