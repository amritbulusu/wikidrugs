'''Agomelatine''' ({{abbrlink|INN|International Nonproprietary Name}}, {{abbrlink|BAN|British Approved Name}}; brand names '''Valdoxan''', '''Melitor''', '''Thymanax''') is an [[atypical antidepressant]] developed by the pharmaceutical company [[Servier]]. It is marketed for the treatment of [[major depressive disorder]], primarily for its relatively favorable side effect profile: it avoids the weight gain, sexual dysfunction, and severe [[Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome|withdrawal]] associated with the most commonly used classes of antidepressants ([[SSRI discontinuation syndrome|SSRIs]], [[SNRI]]s, [[tricyclic antidepressant|tricyclic]]s), while providing similar therapeutic benefit.<ref name="pmid24343836">{{cite journal | vauthors = Guaiana G, Gupta S, Chiodo D, Davies SJ, Haederle K, Koesters M | title = Agomelatine versus other antidepressive agents for major depression | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = | issue = 12 | pages = CD008851 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24343836 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD008851.pub2 | url = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Product_Information/human/000915/WC500046227.pdf | title = Product Information: Valdoxan, INN-agomelatine | date = 13 November 2013 | website = www.ema.europa.eu | publisher = European Medicines Agency | access-date = 27 February 2016}}</ref><ref name="pmid24647162">{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor D, Sparshatt A, Varma S, Olofinjana O | title = Antidepressant efficacy of agomelatine: meta-analysis of published and unpublished studies | journal = BMJ | volume = 348 | issue = | pages = g1888 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24647162 | pmc = 3959623 | doi = | url = }}</ref>

Due to its distinctive [[mechanism of action]], agomelatine is also studied for its effects on [[Circadian rhythm|sleep regulation]]. Studies report various improvements in general quality of sleep metrics, as well as specific therapeutic benefits in [[Circadian rhythm sleep disorder|circadian rhythm disorders]].<ref name="pmid24647162" /><ref name="pmid18753276" /><ref name="MNT2005" />

===Use in special populations===
It is not recommended for use in [[children]] and [[adolescents]] below 18 years of age due to a lack of data on [[safety]] and [[efficacy]].<ref name ="emea" /> Only limited clinical data is available on the use of agomelatine in elderly patients ≥ 65 years old with major depressive episodes. Therefore, caution should be exercised when prescribing it to these patients.<ref name ="emea" />

==Contraindications==
Agomelatine is contraindicated in patients with kidney or [[hepatic impairment|liver impairment]].<ref name ="emea" /> According to information disclosed by Les Laboratoires Servier on October 10, 2012, guidelines for the follow-up of patients treated with Valdoxan have been modified in concert with the [[European Medicines Agency]]. As some patients may experience increased levels of liver enzymes in their blood during treatment with Valdoxan, doctors have to run laboratory tests to check that the liver is working properly at the initiation of the treatment and then periodically during treatment, and subsequently decided whether to pursue the treatment or not.<ref>http://www.servier.com/content/information-about-valdoxan-patients.</ref> No relevant modification in agomelatine pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with severe renal impairment has been observed. However, only limited clinical data on its use in depressed patients with severe or moderate [[renal impairment]] with major depressive episodes is available. Therefore, caution should be exercised when prescribing agomelatine to these patients.<ref name ="emea" />

==Adverse effects==
Agomelatine does not alter daytime [[vigilance (psychology)|vigilance]] and [[memory]] in healthy volunteers. In depressed patients, treatment with the drug increased [[Slow-wave sleep|slow wave]] sleep without modification of REM ([[Rapid eye movement sleep|Rapid Eye Movement]]) sleep amount or REM latency. Agomelatine also induced an advance of the time of sleep onset and of minimum heart rate. From the first week of treatment, onset of sleep and the quality of sleep were significantly improved without daytime clumsiness as assessed by patients.<ref name = PI/><ref name ="emea" />

Agomelatine appears to cause fewer [[SSRI#Sexual dysfunction|sexual side effects]] and [[discontinuation]] effects than paroxetine.<ref name = PI/> It appears better tolerated than the [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors|SSRIs]].<ref name = Pool />

==Interactions==
Agomelatine is a substrate of [[CYP1A2]], [[CYP2C9]] and [[CYP2C19]]. Inhibitors of these enzymes, e.g. the SSRI antidepressant [[fluvoxamine]], reduce its clearance and can therefore lead to an increase in agomelatine exposure.<ref name = PI/><ref name=AMH>{{cite book|title=Australian Medicines Handbook 2013|year=2013|publisher=The Australian Medicines Handbook Unit Trust|location=Adelaide|isbn=9780980579093}}</ref> There is also the potential for agomelatine to interact with [[Ethanol|alcohol]] to increase the risk of [[hepatotoxicity]].<ref name = PI/><ref name = AMH/>

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Agomelatine is a [[melatonin receptor agonist]] ([[melatonin receptor 1A|MT<sub>1</sub>]] (K<sub>i</sub ≥ 0.1&nbsp;nM) and [[melatonin receptor 1B|MT<sub>2</sub>]] (K<sub>i</sub> = 0.12&nbsp;nM)) and a [[serotonin]] [[5-HT2C receptor|5-HT<sub>2C</sub>]] (K<sub>i</sub> = 631&nbsp;nM) [[receptor antagonist]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dridi|first=D|author2=Zouiten, A|author3= Mansour, HB|title=Depression: chronophysiology and chronotherapy|journal=Biological Rhythm Research|volume=45|date=June 2013|pages=1–15|doi=10.1080/09291016.2013.797657}}</ref> Binding studies indicate that it has no effect on [[monoamine neurotransmitter|monoamine]] [[reuptake|uptake]] and no [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for [[adrenergic receptor|adrenergic]], [[histamine receptor|histamine]], [[acetylcholine receptor|cholinergic]], [[dopamine receptor|dopamine]], and [[benzodiazepine receptor]]s, nor other [[serotonin receptor]]s.<ref name ="emea" />

Agomelatine has shown an antidepressant-like effect in [[animal models of depression]] (learned helplessness test, despair test, chronic mild stress) as well as in models with circadian rhythm desynchronisation and in models related to stress and anxiety. In humans, agomelatine has positive phase shifting properties; it induces a phase advance of sleep, body temperature decline and [[melatonin]] onset.<ref name ="emea" />

==Chemistry==

===Structure===
[[File:Agomelatine-vs-melatonin-2D-skeletal.png|200px|thumb|right|[[Melatonin]] (top) vs. agomelatine (bottom)]]

The [[chemical structure]] of agomelatine is very similar to that of melatonin. Where melatonin has an NH group, agomelatine has an HC=CH group. Thus melatonin contains an [[indole]] part, whereas agomelatine has a [[naphthalene]] [[bioisostere]] instead.<ref>{{ cite journal | journal = [[Acta Crystallographica|Acta Crystallogr.

==History==
Agomelatine was discovered and developed by the [[Europe]]an [[pharmaceutical]] company [[Servier|Servier Laboratories Ltd]]. Servier continued to develop the drug and conduct [[Clinical trials#Phase III|phase III trials]] in the [[European Union]].

In March 2005, Servier submitted agomelatine to the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) under the trade names '''Valdoxan''' and '''Thymanax'''.<ref name="Q&A"/> On 27 July 2006, the [[CHMP|Committee for Medical Products for Human Use]] (CHMP) of the EMA recommended a refusal of the marketing authorisation. The major concern was that efficacy had not been sufficiently shown, while there were no special concerns about [[adverse effect|side effects]].<ref name= "Q&A">{{cite news|url=http://www.emea.europa.eu/humandocs/PDFs/EPAR/valdoxan/H-656-657-RQ&A-en.pdf|title=Questions and Answers on Recommendation for Refusal of Marketing Authorisation|date=18 November 2006|publisher=[[European Medicines Agency]]|accessdate=6 July 2009}}</ref> In September 2007, Servier submitted a new marketing application to the EMA.<ref name= "CHMP">{{cite news|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Public_assessment_report/human/000915/WC500046226.pdf|title=CHMP Assessment Report for Valdoxan|date=20 November 2008|publisher=European Medicines Agency|accessdate=6 July 2009}}</ref>

In March 2006, [[Servier]] announced it had sold the rights to market agomelatine in the United States to [[Novartis]].<ref name="Bentham">{{cite news|url=http://www.servier.co.uk/news/news-details.asp?StoryID=76|title=  Servier and Novartis sign licensing agreement for agomelatine, a novel treatment for depression|last=Bentham|first=Clara|date=2006-03-29|publisher=Servier UK|accessdate=2009-05-15| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090416210513/http://www.servier.co.uk/news/news-details.asp?StoryID=76| archivedate= 16 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> It was undergoing several phase III clinical trials in the US, and until October 2011 Novartis listed the drug as scheduled for submission to the FDA no earlier than 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=agomelatine|title=Clinical trials for agomelatine|work=[[ClinicalTrials.gov]]|publisher=[[National Institutes of Health]]|accessdate=6 July 2009}}</ref> However, the development for the US market was discontinued in October 2011, when the results from the last of those trials became available.<ref>[http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartis-drops-future-blockbuster-agomelatine-322880 Novartis drops future blockbuster agomelatine.] Scrip Intelligence, Oct 25 2011 (retrieved Oct 30, 2011).</ref>

It received [[European Medicines Agency|EMA]] approval for marketing in the European Union in February 2009<ref name = emea /> and [[Therapeutic Goods Administration|TGA]] approval for marketing in [[Australia]] in August 2010.<ref name = PI/>

==Research==
Agomelatine is under development by Servier for the treatment of [[generalized anxiety disorder]] and has reached [[Phases of clinical research#Phase III|phase III]] [[clinical trial]]s for this indication, but in August 2017, Servier communicated that development for this indication is currently suspended.<ref name="AdisInsight">http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800004111</ref>
