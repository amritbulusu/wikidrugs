==Uses==

===Paracetamol overdose===
{{Main article|Paracetamol poisoning}}
Intravenous and oral formulations of acetylcysteine are available for the treatment of [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) overdose.<ref name="Green et al">{{cite journal | vauthors = Green JL, Heard KJ, Reynolds KM, Albert D | title = Oral and Intravenous Acetylcysteine for Treatment of Acetaminophen Toxicity: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis | journal = The Western Journal of Emergency Medicine | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 218–26 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23687539 | pmc = 3656701 | doi = 10.5811/westjem.2012.4.6885 }}</ref>  When paracetamol is taken in large quantities, a minor metabolite called ''N''-acetyl-''p''-benzoquinone imine ([[NAPQI]]) accumulates within the body.  It is normally [[Xenobiotic metabolism#Phase II – conjugation|conjugated]] by [[glutathione]], but when taken in excess, the body's glutathione reserves are not sufficient to inactivate the toxic NAPQI.  This metabolite is then free to react with key hepatic enzymes, thereby damaging [[hepatocyte|liver cells]].  This may lead to severe liver damage and even death by [[acute liver failure]].

In the treatment of acetaminophen overdose, acetylcysteine acts to maintain or replenish depleted glutathione reserves in the liver and enhance non-toxic metabolism of acetaminophen.<ref name="Acetadote Package Insert">{{cite web|title=Acetadote Package Insert|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2006/021539s004lbl.pdf|publisher=FDA|accessdate=19 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825114200/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2006/021539s004lbl.pdf|archivedate=25 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  These actions serve to protect liver cells from NAPQI toxicity. It is most effective in preventing or lessening hepatic injury when administered within 8–10 hours after overdose.<ref name="Acetadote Package Insert"/> Research suggests that the rate of liver toxicity is approximately 3% when acetylcysteine is administered within 10 hours of overdose.<ref name="Green et al" />

Although both IV and oral acetylcysteine are equally effective for this indication, oral administration is poorly tolerated because high oral doses are required due to low oral [[bioavailability]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Borgström L, Kågedal B, Paulsen O | title = Pharmacokinetics of N-acetylcysteine in man | journal = European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 217–22 | date = 1986 | pmid = 3803419 | doi = 10.1007/bf00606662 }}</ref> because of its very unpleasant taste and odour, and because of [[adverse drug reaction|adverse effect]]s, particularly nausea and vomiting. Prior pharmacokinetic studies of acetylcysteine did not consider [[acetylation]] as a reason for the low bioavailability of acetylcysteine.<ref name="Dilger_2007">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dilger RN, Baker DH | title = Oral N-acetyl-L-cysteine is a safe and effective precursor of cysteine | journal = Journal of Animal Science | volume = 85 | issue = 7 | pages = 1712–8 | date = Jul 2007 | pmid = 17371789 | doi = 10.2527/jas.2006-835 }}</ref> Oral acetylcysteine is identical in bioavailability to cysteine precursors.<ref name = Dilger_2007/> However, 3% to 6% of people given intravenous acetylcysteine show a severe, [[anaphylaxis]]-like allergic reaction, which may include extreme breathing difficulty (due to [[bronchospasm]]), [[hypotension|a decrease in blood pressure]], rash, [[angioedema]], and sometimes also nausea and vomiting.<ref name="pmid16990628">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kanter MZ | title = Comparison of oral and i.v. acetylcysteine in the treatment of acetaminophen poisoning | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | volume = 63 | issue = 19 | pages = 1821–7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16990628 | doi = 10.2146/ajhp060050 }}</ref> Repeated doses of intravenous acetylcysteine will cause these allergic reactions to progressively worsen in these people.

===Mucolytic therapy===
Inhaled acetylcysteine has been used for [[mucolytic]] ("mucus-dissolving") therapy in addition to other therapies in respiratory conditions with excessive and/or thick mucus production. It is also used post-operatively, as a diagnostic aid, and in [[tracheotomy]] care. It may be considered ineffective in [[cystic fibrosis]].<ref>Rossi S, editor.

===Nephroprotective agent===
Oral acetylcysteine is used for the prevention of [[radiocontrast]]-induced nephropathy (a form of [[acute kidney failure]]). Some studies show that prior administration of acetylcysteine decreases radiocontrast nephropathy,<ref name="pmid10900277">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tepel M, van der Giet M, Schwarzfeld C, Laufer U, Liermann D, Zidek W | title = Prevention of radiographic-contrast-agent-induced reductions in renal function by acetylcysteine | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 343 | issue = 3 | pages = 180–4 | date = Jul 2000 | pmid = 10900277 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200007203430304 }}</ref> whereas others do not.<ref name="pmid14747387">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoffmann U, Fischereder M, Krüger B, Drobnik W, Krämer BK | title = The value of N-acetylcysteine in the prevention of radiocontrast agent-induced nephropathy seems questionable | journal = Journal of the American Society of Nephrology | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 407–10 | date = Feb 2004 | pmid = 14747387 | doi = 10.1097/01.ASN.0000106780.14856.55 }}</ref><ref name="pmid15459602">{{cite journal | vauthors = Miner SE, Dzavik V, Nguyen-Ho P, Richardson R, Mitchell J, Atchison D, Seidelin P, Daly P, Ross J, McLaughlin PR, Ing D, Lewycky P, Barolet A, Schwartz L | title = N-acetylcysteine reduces contrast-associated nephropathy but not clinical events during long-term follow-up | journal = American Heart Journal | volume = 148 | issue = 4 | pages = 690–5 | date = Oct 2004 | pmid = 15459602 | doi = 10.1016/j.ahj.2004.05.015 }}</ref> It has been concluded that

A clinical trial from 2010, however, found that acetylcysteine is ineffective for the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy. This trial, involving 2,308 patients, found that acetylcysteine was no better than a placebo; whether acetylcysteine or the placebo was used, the incidence of nephropathy was the same — 13%.<ref name="pmid21859972">{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Acetylcysteine for prevention of renal outcomes in patients undergoing coronary and peripheral vascular angiography: main results from the randomized Acetylcysteine for Contrast-induced nephropathy Trial (ACT) | journal = Circulation | volume = 124 | issue = 11 | pages = 1250–9 | date = Sep 2011 | pmid = 21859972 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.038943 }}</ref>

Despite the conflicting research outcomes, the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Guidelines suggest the use of oral acetylcysteine for the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy in high-risk individuals, given its potential for benefit, low likelihood of adverse effects, and low cost.<ref name="KDIGO 2012">{{cite journal | last = Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Acute Kidney Injury Work Group | title = KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline for Acute Kidney Injury | url = http://www.kdigo.org/clinical_practice_guidelines/pdf/KDIGO%20AKI%20Guideline.pdf | accessdate = 19 April 2014 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140420012210/http://www.kdigo.org/clinical_practice_guidelines/pdf/KDIGO%20AKI%20Guideline.pdf | archivedate = 20 April 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

===Hemorrhagic cystitis===

It is a white to white with light yellow cast powder, and has a pKa of 9.5 at 30&nbsp;°C.<ref>{{cite web|title=N-ACETYL-L-CYSTEINE Product Information |url=https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/docs/Sigma-Aldrich/Product_Information_Sheet/a7250pis.pdf |website=Sigma |publisher=Sigma-aldrich |accessdate=9 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611120709/http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/docs/Sigma-Aldrich/Product_Information_Sheet/a7250pis.pdf |archivedate=11 June 2014 }}</ref>

==Dosage forms==
Acetylcysteine is available in different dosage forms for different indications:
* Solution for inhalation (Assist, Mucomyst, Mucosil) – inhaled for [[mucolytic]] therapy or ingested for [[nephroprotective]] effect (kidney protection) 
* [[Intravenous therapy|Intravenous]] injection (Assist, Parvolex, Acetadote) – treatment of paracetamol/acetaminophen overdose
* Oral solution – various indications.
* Effervescent tablets
* Ocular solution - for mucolytic therapy
* Tablets - sometimes in a sustained release formula sold as a nutritional supplement
* Capsules
The IV injection and inhalation preparations are, in general, prescription only, whereas the oral solution and the effervescent tablets are available [[over-the-counter substance|over the counter]] in many countries. Acetylcysteine is available as a health supplement in the United States, typically in capsule form.

==Research==

* The effect of acetylcysteine in combination with glucocorticoids (combination group) for people who have severe [[alcoholic hepatitis]] was examined and showed that the combination of acetylcysteine with [[prednisolone]] decreased mortality significantly at one month compared to the [[prednisolone]]-only group (8% vs 24%, P=0.006).  However, the improvement was not as significant at 3 months or 6 months (22% vs 34%, P=0.06) and (27% vs 38%, P=0.07). Factors that were associated with increased 6-month survival included younger age, shorter [[prothrombin time]], lower levels of [[bilirubin]] in baseline studies, and decrease in [[bilirubin]] on day 14, all (P<0.001). Death due to hepatorenal syndrome occurred less frequently for the combination group at 6 months (9% vs 22%, P=0.02) and infections were also less frequent in the combination group as well (P=0.001). Six-month survival, the primary outcome, was not improved in conclusion.<ref name="pmid22070475">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nguyen-Khac E, Thevenot T, Piquet MA, Benferhat S, Goria O, Chatelain D, Tramier B, Dewaele F, Ghrib S, Rudler M, Carbonell N, Tossou H, Bental A, Bernard-Chabert B, Dupas JL | title = Glucocorticoids plus N-acetylcysteine in severe alcoholic hepatitis | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 365 | issue = 19 | pages = 1781–9 | date = Nov 2011 | pmid = 22070475 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1101214 }}</ref>

* Addiction to certain addictive drugs (e.g., [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], [[alcohol]], and [[nicotine]]) is correlated with a persistent reduction in the expression of [[EAAT2|excitatory amino acid transporter 2]] (EAAT2) in the [[nucleus accumbens]] (NAcc);<ref name="pmid24442756" /> the reduced expression of EAAT2 in this region is implicated in addictive drug-seeking behavior.<ref name="pmid24442756" /> In particular, the long-term dysregulation of glutamate neurotransmission in the NAcc of addicts is associated with an increase in vulnerability to [[relapse]] after re-exposure to the addictive drug or its associated [[drug cues]].<ref name="pmid24442756" /> Drugs which help to normalize the expression of EAAT2 in this region, such as N-acetylcysteine, have been proposed as an [[adjunct therapy]] for the treatment of addiction to cocaine, nicotine, alcohol, and other drugs.<ref name="pmid24442756"/>
