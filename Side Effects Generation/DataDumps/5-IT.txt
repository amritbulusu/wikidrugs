== Chemistry ==
Although 5-IT is a [[positional isomer]] of the [[tryptamine]] drug [[alpha-methyltryptamine|αMT]], the compound is not itself a tryptamine as the indole ring is substituted at the 5 position rather than at the 3 position. The compound is closer chemically to phenethylamine derivatives such as [[5-APB]]. This is reflected in the compound's effects when used as a drug, which are reportedly stimulating rather than psychedelic.

== Pharmacology ==

5-IT acts as a [[Serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine releasing agent|triple monoamine releasing agent]] with EC<sub>50</sub> values of 12.9 nM for [[dopamine]], 13.3 nM for [[norepinephrine]] and 104.8 nM for [[serotonin]] and also as [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAO-A inhibitor]].<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028390815300952 | title=The new psychoactive substances 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole (5-IT) and 6-(2-aminopropyl)indole (6-IT) interact with monoamine transporters in brain tissue | date=February 2016 | author=Julie A.

== Dosage and effects ==
[[Alexander Shulgin]] wrote briefly about 5-IT in ''[[TiHKAL]]'' saying: "at 20 milligrams orally, [it] is a long-lived stimulant producing increased heart-rate, anorexia, diuresis, and slight hyperthermia for about twelve hours."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shulgin |first1=Alexander |authorlink1=Alexander Shulgin |title=Tihkal: A Continuation [Paperback] |publisher=Transform Press |date=December 1997  |url=https://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal48.shtml |accessdate=2012-02-08 |isbn=978-0-9630096-9-2}}</ref> As 5-IT is not a tryptamine and thus not within the scope of the book, it is not discussed in any more detail than this.

The following symptoms can indicate 5-IT has been ingested: [[hyperthermia]], [[tachycardia]], [[increased blood pressure]], [[dilated pupils]] (mydriasis), [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]], excessive [[sweat]]ing, [[jaw clenching]], [[insomnia]], [[disorientation]], [[Psychomotor agitation|restlessness]], [[anxiety]], and [[tremor]].<ref name=Welter/>  It is an MAOI, and when combined with a contraindicated substance, it can lead to death.

== Deaths ==
5-IT has been attributed to 14 deaths of people in Sweden since its discovery.<ref name="5-it-kills-14-in-sweden">{{cite news | url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article15178324.ab | title=Nätdrog dödade 14 unga män | date=28 July 2012 | newspaper=Aftonbladet | language=Swedish}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | first1=L.

The 14 deaths occurred between April and July 2012, but a definitive identification of 5-IT in the post-mortem samples was not made until July. All of the dead were young men aged between 20-30. Eleven non-fatal poisonings due to 5-IT also reportedly occurred during the same time period.<ref name=swe-public-health>{{cite web|title=Fem nya ämnen klassas som narkotika|url=http://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/nyheter-och-press/nyhetsarkiv/2014/augusti/fem-nya-amnen-klassas-som-narkotika/ |publisher=The Swedish National Institute of Public Health |language=Swedish|accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref>
