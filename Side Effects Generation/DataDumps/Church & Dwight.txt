'''Church & Dwight Co, Inc.''' is a major American manufacturer of household products that is based in [[Ewing, New Jersey]]. While it manufactures many items, it is best known for its [[Arm & Hammer (brand)|Arm & Hammer]] line which includes [[Sodium bicarbonate|baking soda]] and a variety of products made with it. Church & Dwight was ranked 702 in the [[Fortune 500]] listing of companies in 2015.<ref name="rankings" />

The company was founded in 1846 to unify two companies created by [[John Dwight (manufacturer)|John Dwight]] of [[Massachusetts]] and his brother-in-law, [[Austin Church]] of [[Connecticut]]. Their partnership had begun in 1846 with the two founders selling [[sodium bicarbonate]] (also known as baking soda) that they refined in Dwight's kitchen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.churchdwight.com/company/who-we-are/history.aspx|title=History|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref>

The Arm & Hammer logo, which dates back to the 1860s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trivia-library.com/a/history-of-product-names-and-trademarks-arm-and-hammer-baking-soda.htm|title=History of Product Names & Trademarks: Arm & Hammer Baking Soda|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref> is often incorrectly claimed to have originated with tycoon [[Armand Hammer]]. Hammer was so often asked about the Church & Dwight brand, however, that he attempted to buy the company. While unsuccessful, Hammer's [[Occidental Petroleum]] in 1986 acquired enough stock for him to join the Church & Dwight board of directors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/182/did-tycoon-armand-hammer-have-anything-to-do-with-arm-hammer-baking-soda|title=The Straight Dope: Did tycoon Armand Hammer have anything to do with Arm & Hammer baking soda?|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref>

In 2001 the [[consumer product]] line of [[Carter-Wallace]] was sold to Church and Dwight and [[MedPointe]] bought the diagnostics and drug businesses.<ref name=sold>{{cite news |title=Carter-Wallace's brands will be sold to 2 different companies for a total of $1.12 billion |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/72690604.html?dids=72690604:72690604&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=May+09%2C+2001&author=CATHERINE+DODGE&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=Markets+%2F+Your+Money%3B+Consumer+Products+Company+to+Be+Split%3B+Deals%3A+Carter-Wallace's+brands+will+be+sold+to+2+different+companies+for+a+total+of+%241.12+billion.&pqatl=google |quote=Carter-Wallace, ending a yearlong process to find buyers for its many brands, will split its consumer brands—including Trojan condoms and Arrid deodorant—from its health business, after failing to attract a better offer for the entire company. For Church & Dwight, which owns the Arm & Hammer baking soda product line, the purchase of Carter-Wallace's deodorant and pet- care lines will help the firm expand internationally, it said. A 50- 50 venture Church has formed with Kelso will take the other consumer lines. MedPointe will get Carter-Wallace's diagnostics and drug businesses, which make the allergy medicine Astelin, the muscle relaxant Soma and Rynatan/Tussi cough and cold products. ...|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=May 9, 2001 |accessdate=2011-09-26 }}</ref>

In 2017, [[MidOcean Partners]] agreed to sell [[Water Pik, Inc.|Waterpik]] for $1 billion to Church & Dwight. At the time of the sale announcement, it was reported that Water Pik, Inc. had "$265 million of revenue in the fiscal year ended June 30, about 70% of which came from its water flosser products".<ref>Vasquez, Justina, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/church-dwight-to-buy-water-pik-for-1-billion-1500297236 "Church & Dwight to Buy Water Pik for $1 Billion"] {{subscription}}, ''Wall Street Journal'', July 17, 2017.
