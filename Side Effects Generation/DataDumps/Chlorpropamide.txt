'''Chlorpropamide''' is a [[drug]] in the [[sulfonylurea]] class used to treat [[diabetes mellitus type 2]]. It is a long-acting first-generation sulfonylurea. It has more [[Adverse effect|side effects]] than other sulfonylureas and its use is no longer recommended.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Mechanism of action==
Like other sulfonylureas, chlorpropamide acts to increase the secretion of [[insulin]], so it is only effective in patients who have some [[pancreas|pancreatic]] [[beta cell]] function. It can cause relatively long episodes of [[hypoglycemia]]; this is one reason why shorter-acting sulfonylureas such as [[gliclazide]] or [[tolbutamide]] are used instead. The risk of hypoglycemia makes this drug a poor choice for the [[Old age|elderly]] and patients with mild to moderate [[liver|hepatic]] and [[kidney|renal]] impairment. Chlorpropamide is also used in partial [[central diabetes insipidus]].<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile">

==Pharmacokinetics==
Maximal plasma concentrations are reached 3 to 5 hours after quick and nearly complete (>90%) resorption from the gut. [[Blood plasma|Plasma]] half life is 36 hours; the drug is effective for about 24 hours, longer than other sulfonylureas. A stable plasma level is only reached after three days of continuous application. 90% of the drug are bound to plasma proteins; at least two [[albumin]] binding sites exist. More than 99% of chlorpropamide are excreted unchanged via the kidneys. It is first filtrated in the [[glomeruli]], then reabsorbed, and finally [[tubular secretion|secreted into the tubular lumen]].<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" />

==Cautions and contraindications==
{{see|Sulfonylurea#Side-effects and cautions}}
Chlorpropamide and other sulfonylureas encourage weight gain, so they are generally not favored for use in very [[obesity|obese]] patients. [[Metformin]] (Glucophage) is considered a better drug for these patients. Sulfonylureas should be used with caution or generally avoided in patients with hepatic and renal impairment, patients with [[porphyria]], patients who are [[breastfeeding]], patients with [[ketoacidosis]], and elderly patients.<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" /><ref name="Drugs.com">Drugs.com: [http://www.drugs.com/monograph/chlorpropamide.html Chlorpropamide]</ref> Chlorpropamide, while effective in the treatment of diabetics in patients of Chinese descent, should never be used in people of Mongolian descent.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===Other side effects===
The most common side effects are skin related, such as [[rashes]], [[photoallergy]] and (in rare cases) [[Stevens-Johnson syndrome]].<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" /> Less common side effects of chlorpropamide include gastrointestinal symptoms such as [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], and [[diarrhea]].<ref name="Drugs.com" /> It may cause [[blushing|facial flushing]] after the ingestion of [[alcohol]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Alcohol sensitivity in diabetics receiving chlorpropamide|year=1962|last=Fitzgerald|first=M.G.|journal=Diabetes|volume=11|pages=40–46}}</ref> In very high doses it can increase secretion of [[antidiuretic hormone]] (ADH), which can lead to [[hyponatremia]].<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" /> It also markedly raises the serum level of [[alkaline phosphatase]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Chemical properties==
Chlorpropamide is a white crystalline powder with no characteristic taste or smell. It exhibits [[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphism]]. Its [[acid dissociation constant]] p''K''<sub>a</sub> is 5.0 at 20&nbsp;°C.<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" />
