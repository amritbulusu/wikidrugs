'''Celiprolol''' (brand names Cardem, Selectol, Celipres, Celipro, Celol, Cordiax, Dilanorm) is a [[medication]] in the class of [[beta blocker]]s, used in the treatment of [[hypertension|high blood pressure]]. It has a unique pharmacology: it is a selective [[Beta-1 adrenergic receptor|β1 receptor]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]], but a [[Beta-2 adrenergic receptor|β2 receptor]] partial [[agonist]].  It is also a weak [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|α2 receptor]] antagonist.

In 2010, a clinical trial has suggested a use for this medication in the prevention of vascular complications of a rare inherited disease called vascular [[Ehlers–Danlos syndrome]].  This study demonstrated decreased incidence of arterial rupture or dissection (a specific type of arterial rupture in which the layers of the vessel separate prior to complete failure of the artery wall).<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ong K-T | title = Effect of celiprolol on prevention of cardiovascular events in vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: a prospective randomised, open, blinded-endpoints trial | journal = Lancet | year = 2010 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60960-9 | volume = 376 | issue = 9751 | pages = 1476–1484 | pmid = 20825986|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

Celiprolol is believed to provide clinical benefit for people with vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome by promoting normal collagen synthesis in the blood vessels, and by shifting the pressure load away from the vessels most prone to dissection and rupture. <ref>{{cite journal | author = Beridze N, Frishman WH | title = Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and prevention and treatment of its complications | journal = Cardiol Rev. | year = 2012 | doi=10.1097/CRD.0b013e3182342316 | volume = 1 | pages = 4-7 | pmid = 22143279}}</ref>  Acer Therapeutics is currently developing celiprolol as a potential treatment option specifically for people with vEDS. In 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted celiprolol [[orphan drug]] designation for the treatment of vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.
