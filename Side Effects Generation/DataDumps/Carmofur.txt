'''Carmofur''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) or '''HCFU''' (1-hexylcarbamoyl-5-fluorouracil) is a [[pyrimidine analogue]] used as an [[antineoplastic]] agent. It is a derivative of [[fluorouracil]], being a lypophilic-masked analog of 5-FU that can be administered orally.<ref name=" Shelton 2016">{{cite journal |vauthors=Shelton J, Lu X, Hollenbaugh JA, Cho JH, Amblard F, Schinazi RF | title = Metabolism, Biochemical Actions, and Chemical Synthesis of Anticancer Nucleosides, Nucleotides, and Base Analogs | journal = Chem Rev | volume = 116 | issue = 23 | pages = 14379–14455 |date=Dec 2016 | pmid = 27960273 | doi = 10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00209 }}</ref>

==Biology==
Carmofur prodrug is ingested and taken up in the intestine, overcoming the problem of 5-FU degradation by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase. Once inside a cell, carmofur prodrug is converted into 5-FU.

==Mechanism of action==
The mechanism of action of carmofur prodrug is traditionally thought to be the generation of [[fluorouracil|5–FU]].<ref name=Realini2013/> However, carmofur is a highly potent [[acid ceramidase]] (AC) inhibitor.<ref name=Realini2013/> [[Ceramide]] influences cancer cell survival, growth and death.<ref name=Realini2013/> Inhibition of AC activity sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of antineoplastic agents and radiation.<ref name=Realini2013>{{cite journal|last1=Realini|first1=Natalia|last2=Solorzano|first2=Carlos|last3=Pagliuca|first3=Chiara|last4=Pizzirani|first4=Daniela|last5=Armirotti|first5=Andrea|last6=Luciani|first6=Rosaria|last7=Paola Costi|first7=Maria | last8=Bandiera | first8=Tiziano|last9=Piomelli|first9=Daniele|title=Discovery of highly potent acid ceramidase inhibitors with in vitro tumor chemosensitizing activity | journal=Scientific Reports | date= Jan 2013 | volume=3 | issue=1035 | doi=10.1038/srep01035 | pmid=23301156 | pmc=3539145}}</ref>

==Medicinal uses==
Product marketing for carmofur started in 1981. Carmofur has also been used as adjuvant chemotherapy for curatively resected [[colon cancer|colorectal cancer]] patients in China, Japan, and Finland for many years.<ref name=" Sakamoto 2006 ">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sakamoto J, Oba K, Matsui T, Kobayashi M | title = Efficacy of oral anticancer agents for colorectal cancer | journal = Dis.

==Adverse effects==
As fluorouracil, carmofur has been known to induce [[Toxic leukoencephalopathy|leukoencephalopathy]], characterized by progressive damage to white matter in the brain with stroke-like symptome.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yamada T, Okamura S, Okazaki T |title=Leukoencephalopathy following treatment with carmofur: a case report and review of the Japanese literature |journal=Asia Oceania J Obstet Gynaecol |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=161–8 |date=June 1989 |pmid=2667512|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Mizutani T |title=[Leukoencephalopathy caused by antineoplastic drugs] |language=Japanese |journal=Brain Nerve |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=137–41 |date=February 2008 |pmid=18306661}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Baehring JM, Fulbright RK |title=Delayed leukoencephalopathy with stroke-like presentation in chemotherapy recipients |journal=J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry |volume=79 |issue=5 |pages=535–9 |date=May 2008 |pmid=17682013 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2007.123737}}</ref>

A clinical trial for small hepatocellular carcinoma was stopped prematurely because 56% of the treated patients had unacceptable side effects. Moreover, the treatment had no survival advantage for stage 1 and 2 cancer patients.<ref name=" Yamamoto 1996 ">{{cite journal |vauthors= Yamamoto M, Arii S, Sugahara K, Tobe T | title = Adjuvant oral chemotherapy to prevent recurrence after curative resection for hepatocellular carcinoma | journal = Br J Surg | volume = 83 | issue = 3 | pages = 336–40 |date=Mar 1996 | pmid = 8665186 | doi=10.1002/bjs.1800830313}}</ref> This may be a reason why carmofur was never pursued for FDA-approval in the US.<ref name=" Shelton 2016"/>

== Chemical synthesis==
Ozaki et al. has reported carmofur synthesized by treating 5-FU with phosgene and hexylamine.<ref name=" Ozaki 1987 ">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ozaki S, Nagase T, Ahmad S, Tamai H, Hoshi A, Iigo M | title = Synthesis and antitumor activity of 1- or 3-(alpha-hetero substituted)alkyl-5-fluorouracil derivatives | journal = Nucleic Acids Symp Ser | volume = 18 | pages = 1–4 |date=1987 | pmid = 3697106 }}</ref> Xiong et al. reported an alternative approach for carmofur synthesis.
