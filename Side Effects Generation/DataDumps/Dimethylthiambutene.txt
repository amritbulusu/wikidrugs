'''Dimethylthiambutene''' (''N'',''N''-Dimethyl-1-methyl-3,3-di-2-thienylallylamine, '''DMTB''', trade names '''Ohton, Aminobutene, Dimethibutin, Kobaton, Takaton, Dimethibutin''') is an [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] drug, most often used in veterinary medicine in Japan and to a lesser extent in other countries in the region and around the world.  It is the most prominent and widely used of the thiambutenes, a series of open-chain opioids structurally related to [[methadone]] which are also called the thienyl derivative opioids which also includes [[diethylthiambutene]] and [[ethylmethylthiambutene]], as well as the non-opioid [[cough suppressant]] [[tipepidine]].

Dimethylthiambutene was developed in the United Kingdom in the late 1940s<ref>{{US Patent|2561899}} - Dithienyl Allyl Amines</ref> and introduced to the market by Burroughs-Wellcome in 1951.  Dimethylthiambutene is now under international control under the UN [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] 1961, the laws governing habit-forming substances in virtually all countries and [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule I controlled substances|Schedule I]] of the US Controlled Substances Act of 1970 due to high abuse potential and never being introduced clinically in the United States; other countries regulate it much as [[morphine]] or [[diamorphine]].  Its DEA ACSCN is 9619 and it had a zero manufacturing quota in 2013.
