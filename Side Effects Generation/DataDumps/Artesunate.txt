==Medical uses==

Artesunate is the first line treatment for children or adults with severe malaria.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Guidelines for treatment of malaria.|last=|first=|publisher=World Health Organization|year=2015|isbn=|edition=3|location=Geneva|pages=|quote=|via=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK294440/}}</ref> The recommendation is to treat with at least 24 hours of artesunate by injection. [[Artemisinin-based combination therapy]] may be used by mouth in persons that can tolerate it after 24 hours by injection. In facilities where long-term care is not appropriate, artesunate may be given as a single intramuscular injection or by rectal route (children < 6 years) prior to transferring care to a higher level facility.

Artesunate is preferred over parenteral quinine for severe malaria treatment.<ref name=CDC2012/> Artesunate was shown to prevent more deaths from severe malaria than quinine in two large multicentre randomized controlled trials from Africa<ref>{{cite journal | author=Dondorp AL | title=Artesunate versus quinine in the treatment of severe falciparum malaria in African children (AQUAMAT): an open-label, randomised trial | year=2010 | journal=The Lancet | volume=376 | issue=9753 | pages=1647–1657 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61924-1 | pmid=21062666 | url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2810%2961924-1/abstract | pmc=3033534|display-authors=etal}}</ref> and Asia.<ref>{{cite journal | author=South East Asian Quinine Artesunate Malaria Trial (SEAQUAMAT) | title=Artesunate versus quinine for treatment of severe falciparum malaria: a randomised trial | year=2005 | journal=The Lancet | volume=366 | issue=9487 | pages=717–725 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67176-0 | pmid=16125588 | url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2805%2967176-0/abstract}}</ref> A subsequent systematic review of seven randomized controlled trials found this improvement in survival rates to be consistent across all trials.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sinclair|first=D|author2=Donegan, S|author3= Isba, R|author4= Lalloo, DG|title=Artesunate versus quinine for treating severe malaria|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=Jun 13, 2012|volume=6|issue=6|pages=CD005967|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005967.pub4|pmid=22696354}}</ref>

Artesunate is also used to treat less severe forms of malaria when it can be given orally.<ref name=":1" /> It has activity against ''[[P. ovale]]'', ''[[Plasmodium malariae|P. malariae]]'', and severe ''[[Plasmodium knowlesi|P. knowlesi]]''.<ref name=":1" />

Artesunate + [[sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine]] for treatment of ''[[P. vivax]]'' is not recommended due to high rates of resistance.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

While artesunate is used primarily as treatment for malaria, there is some evidence that it may also have some beneficial effects in ''[[Schistosoma haematobium]]'' infection,<ref>{{cite journal|year=2007|title=Antischistosomal efficacy of artesunate combination therapies administered as curative treatments for malaria attacks|journal=Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg|volume=101|issue=2|pages=113–16|doi=10.1016/j.trstmh.2006.03.003|pmid=16765398|vauthors=Boulangier D, Dieng Y, Cisse B|display-authors=etal}}</ref> but has not been evaluated in large randomized trials.

Although not [[FDA]]-approved for use in the United States, artesunate is used as the treatment of choice for severe malaria by the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization (WHO)]] over [[quinidine]].<ref name=CDC2012/>

===Pregnancy===

When given in the second or third trimesters of pregnancy, no artesunate-related adverse pregnancy outcomes have been reported.<ref>WHO (2007). [http://malaria.who.int/docs/mip/artemisinin_compounds_pregnancy.pdf Assessment of the safety of artemisinin compounds in pregnancy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414125450/http://malaria.who.int/docs/mip/artemisinin_compounds_pregnancy.pdf |date=2010-04-14 }}. World Health Organization, Geneva.</ref> However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the safety of artesunate use in the first trimester of pregnancy. The WHO recommends that artesunate use for severe malaria in the first trimester should be based on the individual risks versus benefits. In absence of other viable treatment options, artesunate may be used.

===Children===

Artesunate is safe for use in children. Artesunate + sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine should be avoided in the newborns due to sulfadoxine/pyrmethamine effects on bilirubin.<ref name=":1" /> Parenteral artesunate dosing for treatment of severe malaria in children less than 20&nbsp;kg should be higher than that of adults in order to increase exposure.<ref name=":1" /> When artesunate cannot be given orally or intramuscularly due to an individual's weakness or inability to swallow, rectal administration may be given as pre-referral treatment as long as parenteral administration is initiated after transfer to a more advanced facility.

==Adverse effects==
Artesunate is generally safe and well-tolerated. The best recognised side effect of the artemesinins is that they lower [[reticulocyte]] counts.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Clark RL | year = 2012 | title = Effects of artemisinins on reticulocyte count and relationship to possible embryotoxicity in confirmed and unconfirmed malarial patients | journal = Birth defects research. Part A, Clinical and molecular teratology | volume = 94 | issue = 2 | pages = 61&ndash;75 | doi = 10.1002/bdra.22868}}</ref> This is not usually of clinical relevance.

With increased use of I.V. artesunate, there have been reports of post-artesunate delayed [[Hemolysis|haemolysis]] (PADH).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.smw.ch/content/smw-2015-14181/|title=Post-artesunate delayed haemolysis ‒ report of four cases and review of the literature|last=Boillat O|first=Spechbach H, Chalandon Y, Eperon|date=|website=Swiss Medical Weekly|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110110458/http://www.smw.ch/content/smw-2015-14181/|archivedate=2016-11-10|df=}}</ref> Delayed haemolysis (occurring around two weeks after treatment) has been observed in patients treated with artesunate for severe malaria.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rolling T, Agbenyega T, Issifou S | title = Delayed hemolysis after treatment with parenteral artesunate in African children with severe malaria&mdash;a double-center prospective study. | journal = J Infect Dis | year = 2013 | pmid = 24376273 | url = http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/12/26/infdis.jit841.long | doi = 10.1093/infdis/jit841 | volume=209 | issue=12 | pages=1921–8|display-authors=etal}}</ref> It is unclear whether or not this haemolysis is due to artesunate or to the malaria itself.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Clark RL | title = Hypothesized cause of delayed hemolysis associated with intravenous artesunate. | journal = Med Hypotheses | year = 2013 | doi = 10.1016/j.mehy.2013.11.027 | pmid = 24370269 | volume=82 | issue=2 | pages=167–70}}</ref>

==Contraindications==
Artesunate is typically a well tolerated medicine. Known contraindications include a previous severe allergic reaction to artesunate.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hess|first=Karl M.|last2=Goad|first2=Jeffery A.|last3=Arguin|first3=Paul M.|date=2010-01-01|title=Intravenous Artesunate for Severe Malaria|url=https://works.bepress.com/goad/3/|doi=10.1345/aph.1M732|pmid=20551300|volume=44|journal=Ann Pharmacother|pages=1250–1258|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110043829/https://works.bepress.com/goad/3/|archivedate=2016-11-10|df=}}</ref>

Drugs that should be avoided while on artesunate are the drugs that inhibit the liver enzyme [[CYP2A6]]. These drugs include [[amiodarone]], [[desipramine]], [[isoniazid]], [[ketoconazole]], [[letrozole]], [[methoxsalen]], [[tranylcypromine]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/research/en/data/sanofi/marketed_products/Artesunate_and_Amodiquine.pdf|title=Artesunate Amodiaquine Winthrop (artesunate, amodiaquine) [summary of product characteristics]|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Sanofi-Aventis|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024090154/http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/research/en/data/sanofi/marketed_products/Artesunate_and_Amodiquine.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-24|df=}}</ref>

==Mechanisms of action==
The mechanisms of action of artesunate remains unclear and debatable. Artesunate is a prodrug that is rapidly converted to its active form [[dihydroartemisinin]] (DHA). This process involves [[hydrolysis]] of the 4-carbon ester group via plasma [[esterase]] enzyme.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Cui|first=Liwang|last2=Su|first2=Xin-zhuan|date=2009-10-01|title=Discovery, mechanisms of action and combination therapy of artemisinin|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1586/eri.09.68|journal=Expert Review of Anti-infective Therapy|volume=7|issue=8|pages=999–1013|doi=10.1586/eri.09.68|issn=1478-7210|pmc=2778258|pmid=19803708}}</ref> It is hypothesized that the cleavage of endoperoxide bridge in the [[pharmacophore]] of DHA generates [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS), which increases oxidative stress and causes malarial protein damage via [[alkylation]].<ref name=":2" /> In addition, Artesunate potently inhibits the essential ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' exported protein 1 (EXP1), a membrane [[MAPEG|glutathione S-transferase]].<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 25126794| year = 2014| author1 = Lisewski| first1 = A. M.| title = Supergenomic Network Compression and the Discovery of EXP1 as a Glutathione Transferase Inhibited by Artesunate| journal = Cell| volume = 158| issue = 4| pages = 916–28| last2 = Quiros| first2 = J.

In 2016, artemisinin has been shown to bind to a large number targets, suggesting that it acts in a promiscuous manner.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang J, Zhang CJ, Chia WN, Loh CC, Li Z, Lee YM, He Y, Yuan LX, Lim TK, Liu M, Liew CX, Lee YQ, Zhang J, Lu N, Lim CT, Hua ZC, Liu B, Shen HM, Tan KS, Lin Q | title = Haem-activated promiscuous targeting of artemisinin in Plasmodium falciparum | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 6 | pages = 10111 | pmid = 26694030 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms10111 | pmc=4703832 | year=2015}}</ref> There is evidence suggesting DHA inhibition of calcium-dependent ATPase on endoplasmic membrane, which disrupts protein folding of parasites.<ref name=":2" />

==Pharmacokinetics==
In infected individuals, the [[Half-life|elimination half-life]] of artesunate is about 0.22 hours. Its active metabolite, DHA, has a slightly longer half-life of 0.34 hours. Overall, the average half-life ranges from 0.5 to 1.5 hours.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=Carrie A.|last2=Duparc|first2=Stephan|last3=Borghini-Fuhrer|first3=Isabelle|last4=Jung|first4=Donald|last5=Shin|first5=Chang-Sik|last6=Fleckenstein|first6=Lawrence|date=2011-01-01|title=Review of the clinical pharmacokinetics of artesunate and its active metabolite dihydroartemisinin following intravenous, intramuscular, oral or rectal administration|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1475-2875-10-263|journal=Malaria Journal|volume=10|pages=263|doi=10.1186/1475-2875-10-263|issn=1475-2875|pmc=3180444|pmid=21914160}}</ref> Because of its short half-life, its use in malaria prevention is limited.<ref name=":2" />

DHA is metabolized to an inactive metabolite by the liver enzymes [[CYP2B6]], [[CYP2C19]], and [[CYP3A4]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hess|first=Karl M.|last2=Goad|first2=Jeffery A.|last3=Arguin|first3=Paul M.|date=2010-07-01|title=Intravenous Artesunate for the Treatment of Severe Malaria|url=http://aop.sagepub.com/content/44/7-8/1250|journal=Annals of Pharmacotherapy|language=en|volume=44|issue=7–8|pages=1250–1258|doi=10.1345/aph.1M732|issn=1060-0280|pmid=20551300}}</ref>

==Chemical synthesis==
Artesunate is made from [[dihydroartemisinin]] (DHA) by reacting it with [[succinic acid anhydride]] in a basic medium. It is one of many [[semi-synthetic]] [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivative]]<nowiki/>s from [[Artemisinin]] that is water-soluble.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldofchemicals.com/chemicals/chemical-properties/artesunate.html|title=World of Chemicals – online chemical directory,chemistry portal,aricles,news|website=www.worldofchemicals.com|access-date=2016-11-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110114544/http://www.worldofchemicals.com/chemicals/chemical-properties/artesunate.html|archivedate=2016-11-10|df=}}</ref>

==Research==
In 2007, the FDA approved an [[Investigational New Drug]] (IND) protocol for intravenous artesunate.
