== Veterinary use ==
Etorphine is available legally only for [[veterinary medicine|veterinary]] use and is strictly governed by law. It is often used to immobilize [[elephant]]s and other large mammals. [[Diprenorphine]] (M5050), also known as Revivon, is an opioid receptor antagonist that can be administered in proportion to the amount of etorphine used (1.3 times) to reverse its effects. Veterinary-strength etorphine is fatal to humans. For this reason the package as supplied to vets always includes the human antidote as well as etorphine.

The human antidote is generally [[naloxone]], not diprenorphine, and is always prepared before the preparation of etorphine to be immediately administered following accidental human exposure to etorphine. The [[LD50]] in humans is 30&nbsp;μg which led to the requirement that the medicine include an equal dose of an antidote, [[diprenorphine]] or [[naloxone]].

One of its main advantages is its speed of operation and, more importantly, the speed with which [[diprenorphine]] reverses the effects. The high incidence of side-effects, including severe cardiopulmonary depression,  has caused etorphine to fall into disfavor in general veterinary practice.  However, its high potency combined with the rapid action of both etorphine and its antagonist, diprenorphine,  means that it has found a place for capture of large mammals such as rhinoceroses and elephants; under these circumstances both rapid onset and rapid recovery are very important characteristics. The high potency of etorphine means that sufficient etorphine can be administered to large wild mammals by projectile syringe (dart).

'''Large Animal Immobilon''' is a combination of etorphine plus [[acepromazine]] maleate. An etorphine antidote '''Large Animal Revivon''' contains mainly diprenorphine for animals and a human-specific [[naloxone]]-based antidote, which should be prepared prior to the etorphine. A 5–15&nbsp;mg dose is enough to immobilize an African elephant and a 2–4&nbsp;mg dose is enough to immobilize a Black Rhino.<ref name="url_Zoo_Pharm">{{cite web | url = http://wildpharm.com/etorphine-hydrochloride-1mgml.html | title = Etorphine HCl | date = | work = Veterinary medicine for wildlife: immobilisation medicine for animals zoo animals | publisher = Zoo Pharm }}</ref>

== Legal status ==
In [[Hong Kong]], etorphine is regulated under Schedule 1 of Hong Kong's Chapter 134 ''Dangerous Drugs Ordinance''. It can be used legally only by health professionals and for university research purposes. The substance can be given by pharmacists under a prescription. Anyone who supplies the substance without prescription can be fined $10,000 ([[Hong Kong dollar|HKD]]). The penalty for trafficking or manufacturing the substance is a $5,000,000 (HKD) fine and life imprisonment. Possession of the substance for consumption without license from the Department of Health is illegal with a $1,000,000 (HKD) fine and/or 7 years of jail time.

In the [[Netherlands]], etorphine is a list I drug of the [[Opium Law]]. It is used only for veterinary purposes in zoos to immobilize large animals.

In the US, etorphine is listed as a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule I controlled substances|Schedule I]] drug with an ACSCN of 9056, although its [[hydrochloride]] [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] is classified as [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule II controlled substances|Schedule II]] with an ACSCN of 9059.  For both, the 2013 annual aggregate manufacturing quota for both was zero so presumably veterinary supplies of the hydrochloride are imported from Germany and/or the UK.

In the UK, under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, etorphine is controlled as a Class A substance.
