'''Nadroparin''' (trade name, Fraxiparine or Fraxodi) is an anticoagulant belonging to a class of drugs called [[low molecular weight heparin]]s (LMWHs). Nadroparin was developed by sanofi-synthelabo.

Nadroparin is used in general and orthopedic surgery to prevent thromboembolic disorders ([[deep vein thrombosis]] and [[pulmonary embolism]]), and as treatment for [[deep vein thrombosis]]. It is also used to prevent clotting during [[hemodialysis]], and for treatment of [[unstable angina]] and non-Q wave [[myocardial infarction]].<ref name= "Aspri Canada">Fraxiparine PRODUCT MONOGRAPH (Canada); http://www.aspripharma.com/pdf/Fraxiparine%20&%20Fraxi%20Forte%20PM_EN.pdf</ref>

For the treatment and prevention of DVT, the drug is administered as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin), usually around the stomach. Injections are given once or twice daily depending on the condition.<ref name="Aspri Canada" />
