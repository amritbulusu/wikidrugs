There is tentative evidence of the benefit of quetiapine versus placebo in schizophrenia; however, definitive conclusions are not possible due to the high rate of attrition in trials (greater than 50%) and the lack of data on economic outcomes, social functioning, or quality of life.<ref name=Coch2004>{{cite journal|last=Srisurapanont|first=M|author2=Maneeton, B|author3= Maneeton, N|title=Quetiapine for schizophrenia|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|year=2004|issue=2|pages=CD000967|pmid=15106155|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000967.pub2|editor1-last=Srisurapanont|editor1-first=Manit}}</ref>

It is debatable whether, as a class, [[typical antipsychotics|typical]] or [[atypical antipsychotic]]s are more effective.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Kane JM, Correll CU |title=Pharmacologic treatment of schizophrenia |journal=Dialogues Clin Neurosci |volume=12|issue=3 |pages=345–57 |year=2010 |pmid=20954430 |pmc=3085113}}</ref> Both have equal drop-out and symptom relapse rates when typicals are used at low to moderate dosages.<ref name=AFP07>{{vcite journal |author=Schultz SH, North SW, Shields CG |title=Schizophrenia: a review |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=75 |issue=12 |pages=1821–9 |year=2007 |month=June|pmid=17619525}}</ref> While quetiapine has lower rates of extrapyramidal side effects, there is greater sleepiness and rates of dry mouth.<ref name=Coch2004/>

A Cochrane review comparing quetiapine to other atypical antipsychotic agents tentatively concluded that it may be less efficacious than [[olanzapine]] and [[risperidone]]; produce fewer movement related side effects than [[paliperidone]], [[aripiprazole]], [[ziprasidone]], risperidone and olanzapine; and produce weight gain similar to risperidone, [[clozapine]] and aripiprazole. They concluded that it produces suicide attempt, suicide, death, QTc prolongation, [[low blood pressure]], [[tachycardia]], sedation, [[gynaecomastia]], [[galactorrhoea]], [[menstrual irregularity]] and [[white blood cell count]] at a rate similar to first generation antipsychotics.<ref name="Asmal L, Flegar SJ, Wang J, Rummel-Kluge C, Komossa K, Leucht S 2013 CD006625">{{cite journal |vauthors=Asmal L, Flegar SJ, Wang J, Rummel-Kluge C, Komossa K, Leucht S |title=Quetiapine versus other atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=11 |issue= |pages=CD006625 |year=2013 |pmid=24249315 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006625.pub3 |url=}}</ref>

===Bipolar disorder===
In those with [[bipolar disorder]], quetiapine is used to treat depressive episodes, acute manic episodes associated with [[bipolar I disorder]] (as either monotherapy or adjunct therapy to [[Lithium pharmacology|lithium]], [[Valproic acid|valproate]] or [[lamotrigine]]), and maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder (as adjunct therapy to lithium or divalproex).<ref name="Thase MacFadden Weisler Chang et al : Efficacy of Quetiapine Monotherapy in Bipolar I and II Depression">{{cite journal |vauthors=Thase ME, Macfadden W, Weisler RH, Chang W, Paulsson B, Khan A, Calabrese JR | title = Efficacy of Quetiapine Monotherapy in Bipolar I and II Depression | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology | volume = 26 | issue = 6 | pages = 600–9 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17110817 | pmc = | doi = 10.1097/01.jcp.0000248603.76231.b7 }}</ref><ref>British National Formulary (BNF) 65.

===Major depressive disorder===
Quetiapine is effective when used by itself<ref name =Cochrane2010/> and when used along with other medications in [[major depressive disorder]] (MDD).<ref name =Cochrane2010/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Spielmans GI, Berman MI, Linardatos E, Rosenlicht NZ, Perry A, Tsai AC | year = 2013| title = Adjunctive Atypical Antipsychotic Treatment for Major Depressive Disorder: A Meta-Analysis of Depression, Quality of Life, and Safety Outcomes | url = | journal = PLoS Med | volume = 10 | issue = 3| page = e1001403 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001403 | pmid=23554581 | pmc=3595214}}</ref> However, sedation is often an undesirable side effect.<ref name =Cochrane2010/>

In the United States,<ref name = "DD" /> the United Kingdom<ref name = "BNF 65" /> and Australia (while not subsidised by the Australian [[Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme]] for treatment of MDD), quetiapine is licensed for use as an add on treatment in MDD.<ref name = "AMH">{{cite book | title = Australian Medicines Handbook | year = 2013 | publisher = The Australian Medicines Handbook Unit Trust | isbn = 978-0-9805790-9-3 | edition = 2013 | place = Adelaide | editor = Rossi, S }}</ref>

===Alzheimer's disease===
Quetiapine does not decrease agitation among people with [[Alzheimer's]]. Quetiapine worsens intellectual functioning in the elderly with dementia and therefore is not recommended.<ref name="Ballard Margallo-Lana Juszczak Douglas et al : Quetiapine and rivastigmine and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease: randomised double blind placebo controlled trial">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ballard C, Margallo-Lana M, Juszczak E, Douglas S, Swann A, Thomas A, O'Brien J, Everratt A, Sadler S, Maddison C, Lee L, Bannister C, Elvish R, Jacoby R | title = Quetiapine and rivastigmine and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease: randomised double blind placebo controlled trial | journal = BMJ | volume = 330 | issue = 7496 | pages = 874 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15722369 | pmc = 556156 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.38369.459988.8F }}</ref>

===Others===
The use of low doses of quetiapine for [[insomnia]], while common, is not recommended; there is little evidence of benefit and concerns regarding adverse effects.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Coe HV, Hong IS | title = Safety of low doses of quetiapine when used for insomnia | journal = The Annals of pharmacotherapy | volume = 46 | issue = 5 | pages = 718–22 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22510671 | doi = 10.1345/aph.1Q697 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Maglione M, Maher AR, Hu J, etal | title = Off-Label Use of Atypical Antipsychotics: An Update | date = September 2011 | pmid = 22132426 }}</ref>

Quetiapine and [[clozapine]] are the most widely used medications for the treatment of [[Parkinson's disease]] psychosis due to their very low extrapyramidal side effect liability. Owing to the risks associated with clozapine (e.g. agranulocytosis, diabetes mellitus, etc.), clinicians often attempt treatment with quetiapine first, although the evidence to support quetiapine's use for this indication is significantly weaker than that of clozapine.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Shotbolt P, Samuel M, David A | title = Quetiapine in the treatment of psychosis in Parkinson’s disease | journal = Therapeutic Advances in Neurological Disorders | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages = 339–350 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 21179595 | pmc = 3002640 | doi = 10.1177/1756285610389656 }}</ref><ref name = Maudsley/>

Studies conducted on [[beagle]]s have resulted in the formation of [[cataract]]s. While there are reports of cataracts occurring in humans, controlled studies including thousands of patients have not demonstrated a clear causal association between quetiapine therapy and this side-effect.{{Citation needed|reason=Reference needed to April 2006 results of CATIE study.|date=September 2011}} However, the Seroquel website<ref>[http://www.seroquel.com/ Seroquel website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217194559/http://seroquel.com/ |date=2007-02-17 }}</ref> still recommends users have eye examinations every six months.

As with some other anti-psychotics, quetiapine may lower the [[seizure threshold]],<ref>[http://www.astrazeneca-us.com/cgi-bin/az_pi.cgi?product=seroquel&country=us&popup=no Seroquel Prescribing Information]</ref> and should be taken with caution in combination with drugs such as [[bupropion]].

===Discontinuation and withdrawal===
Quetiapine should be discontinued gradually, with careful consideration from the prescribing doctor, to avoid withdrawal symptoms or relapse.

The [[British National Formulary]] recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing anti-psychotic treatment to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse.<ref name="Group 2009 192"/> Due to compensatory changes at dopamine, serotonin, adrenergic and histamine receptor sites in the central nervous system, withdrawal symptoms can occur during abrupt or over-rapid reduction in dosage. However, despite increasing demand for safe and effective antipsychotic withdrawal protocols or dose-reduction schedules, no specific guidelines with proven safety and efficacy are currently available.

Withdrawal symptoms reported to occur after discontinuation of antipsychotics include nausea, [[emesis]], lightheadedness, [[diaphoresis]], [[dyskinesia]], [[orthostatic hypotension]], [[tachycardia]], [[insomnia]], nervousness, dizziness, headache, excessive non-stop crying, and [[anxiety]].<ref name="Kim-2005"/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Michaelides C, Thakore-James M, Durso R | title = Reversible withdrawal dyskinesia associated with quetiapine | journal = Mov Disord | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 769–70 | date = Jun 2005 | pmid = 15747370 | doi = 10.1002/mds.20427 }}</ref> Some have argued that additional somatic and psychiatric symptoms associated with dopaminergic super-sensitivity, including dyskinesia and acute psychosis, are common features of withdrawal in individuals treated with neuroleptics.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = R. | last2 = Chouinard | first2 = G. | title = Loss of striatal cholinergic neurons as a basis for tardive and L-dopa-induced dyskinesias, neuroleptic-induced supersensitivity psychosis and refractory schizophrenia | url = http://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/0006-3223(93)90044-E/abstract | journal = Biol Psychiatry | volume = 34 | issue = 10 | pages = 713–38 |date=Nov 1993 | pmid =7904833 | doi = 10.1016/0006-3223(93)90044-E }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Moncrieff J | title = Does antipsychotic withdrawal provoke psychosis?

Due to compensatory changes at dopamine, serotonin, adrenergic and histamine receptor sites in the central nervous system, a gradual reduction in dosage is recommended to minimise or avoid withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms reported to occur after discontinuation of quetiapine include [[insomnia|trouble sleeping]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[lightheadedness]], [[perspiration|sweating]], [[orthostatic hypotension|feeling light headed when standing]], [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]], as well as [[Anxiety|nervousness]], [[dizziness]], [[headache]], and [[anxiety]]. The present evidence suggests that these symptoms affect a small number of susceptible individuals treated with quetiapine.<ref name="Kim-2005">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kim DR, Staab JP | title = Quetiapine discontinuation syndrome | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 162 | issue = 5 | page = 1020 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15863814 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.162.5.1020 | url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/162/5/1020 }}</ref>

===Pregnancy and lactation===
Placental exposure is least for quetiapine compared to other atypical antipsychotics.<ref name = Maudsley/> The evidence is insufficient to rule out any risk to the foetus but available data suggests it is unlikely to result in any major foetal malformations.<ref name = EMC/><ref name = DM/><ref name = TGA/> It is secreted in breast milk and hence quetiapine-treated mothers are advised not to breastfeed.<ref name = EMC/><ref name = DM/><ref name = TGA/>

==Overdose==
Most instances of acute overdosage result only in sedation, hypotension and tachycardia, but cardiac arrhythmia, coma and death have occurred in adults. Serum or plasma quetiapine concentrations are usually in the 1–10&nbsp;mg/L range in overdose survivors, while postmortem blood levels of 10–25&nbsp;mg/L are generally observed in fatal cases.<ref>R.

===Pharmacokinetics===

The major [[active metabolite]] of quetiapine is [[norquetiapine]] (''N''-desalkylquetiapine).<ref name="pmid18059438" />

[[File:Norquetiapine.svg|left|thumb|200|Skeletal formula of norquetiapine]] {{Clear left}}

==Chemistry==
Quetiapine is a [[tetracyclic compound]] and is closely related structurally to [[clozapine]], [[olanzapine]], [[loxapine]], and other tetracyclic antipsychotics.

===Synthesis===
The synthesis of quetiapine begins with a dibenzothiazepinone. The [[lactam]] is first treated with [[phosphoryl chloride]] to produce a [[dibenzothiazepine]]. A [[nucleophilic substitution]] is used to introduce the sidechain.<ref>Warawa, E. J.; Migler, B. M.; 1988, {{US Patent|4879288}}.</ref>
