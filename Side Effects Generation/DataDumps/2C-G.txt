'''2C-G''' is a [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] [[phenethylamine]] of the [[2C (psychedelics)|2C family]]. First [[Chemical synthesis|synthesized]] by [[Alexander Shulgin]], it is sometimes used as an [[entheogen]]. It has structural and pharmacodynamic properties similar to [[2C-D]] and [[Ganesha (psychedelic)|Ganesha]]. Like many of the phenethylamines in ''[[PiHKAL|PiHKAL (Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved)]]'', 2C-G and its homologues have only been taken by Shulgin and a small test group, making it difficult to ensure completeness when describing effects.

== Chemistry ==
2C-G is 3,4-dimethyl-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, with the formula [[carbon|C]]<sub>12</sub>[[hydrogen|H]]<sub>19</sub>[[nitrogen|N]][[oxygen|O]]<sub>2</sub>.

== Dosage and effects==
In Shulgin's book PiHKAL, the dosage range is listed as 20 to 35 [[milligram|mg]]. Effects are similar to the related [[Ganesha (psychedelic)|Ganesha]], and are extremely long lasting; the duration is 18–30 hours. Visual effects are muted or absent, and it is described in PiHKAL as an "insight-enhancer".<ref>{{CitePiHKAL}}</ref> Unlike other members of the [[2C (psychedelics)|2C family]], 2C-G is nearly as potent as its [[amphetamine]] cousin.

== Homologues ==
Several [[homologous series|homologues]] of 2C-G were also synthesized by Shulgin. These include 2C-G-3, 2C-G-5, and 2C-G-N. Some, such as 2C-G-1, 2C-G-2, 2C-G-4, and 2C-G-6 are possible to synthesize in principle but impossible or extraordinarily difficult to do so in practice.

''Effects'': Stimulation similar to that caused by amphetamines. General sense of unease or unfriendliness for most. 2C-G-N is sometimes called 2C-NPH due to the naphthalene portion of the molecule.

==Law==
2C-G and all of its homologues are unscheduled and uncontrolled in the United States, but possession and sales of 2C-G (and homologues) will probably be prosecuted under the [[Federal Analog Act]] because of their structural similarities to 2C-B.

===Canada===
As of October 31st, 2016; 2C-G is a controlled substance (Schedule III) in Canada. http://gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2016/2016-05-04/html/sor-dors72-eng.php

===United Kingdom===
2C-G and all other compounds featuring in [[PiHKAL]] are [[Class A drug]]s in the [[United Kingdom]].
