'''Sufentanil''' ('''R30730''', brand name '''Sufenta''') is a synthetic [[opioid]] [[analgesic|analgesic drug]] approximately 5 to 10 times more potent than its parent drug, [[fentanyl]], and 500 times as potent as [[morphine]].  Structurally, sufentanil differs from fentanyl through the addition of a methoxymethyl group on the piperidine ring (which is believed to reduce duration of action<ref name="pmid19601792">{{cite journal |vauthors=Vucković S, Prostran M, Ivanović M, ((Dosen-Mićović Lj)), Todorović Z, Nesić Z, Stojanović R, Divac N, Miković Z |title=Fentanyl analogs: structure-activity-relationship study. |journal=Curr Med Chem |volume=16 |issue=9 |pages=2468–2474 |year=2009 |doi= |pmid=19601792}}</ref>), and the replacement of the phenyl ring by [[thiophene]]. Sufentanil first was synthesized at [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]] in 1974.<ref name="pmid12772">{{cite journal |vauthors=Niemegeers CJ, Schellekens KH, Van Bever WF, Janssen PA |title=Sufentanil, a very potent and extremely safe intravenous morphine-like compound in mice, rats and dogs |journal=Arzneimittel-Forschung |volume=26 |issue=8 |pages=1551–6 |year=1976 |pmid=12772 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

Sufentanil is marketed for use by specialist centers under different trade names, such as Sufenta and Sufentil. Sufentanil with and without [[lidocaine]] or [[mepivacaine]] is available as a transdermal patch similar to [[Duragesic]] in Europe under trade names such as Chronogesic.

==Uses==
The main use of this medication is in operating suites and critical care where pain relief is required for a short period of time. It also offers properties of sedation and this makes it a good analgesic component of [[anesthetic]] regimen during an operation.<ref name="pmid11778119">{{cite journal |vauthors=Savoia G, Loreto M, Gravino E |title=Sufentanil: an overview of its use for acute pain management |journal=Minerva Anestesiologica |volume=67 |issue=9 Suppl 1 |pages=206–216 |date=September 2001 |pmid=11778119 |doi= |url=}}</ref> It is usually administered under the doctor's order through an [[intravenous]] route. In some countries, sufentanil is only indicated for [[epidural]] use. Despite this, it is often used off-label both intravenously and intranasally. A [[transdermal patch|transdermal]] sufentanil patch called Transdur-sufentanil is about to enter{{when|date=December 2012}} Stage III clinical trials by Durect Corp for the relief of chronic pain, and has the advantage over fentanyl patches such as [[Duragesic]] of only needing to be applied once per week. Sufentanil is also used off-label in [[intrathecal]] pumps.

Because of its extremely high potency, it is often used in surgery and post-operative pain management for patients that are heavily opioid dependent/opioid tolerant because of long term opiate use for chronic pain or illicit opiate use.  Currently sufentanil is the strongest opioid painkiller available for use in humans.  Although stronger narcotic pain medications do exist, all medications stronger than sufentanil are approved for veterinary use only.  It is also used in surgery and post operative pain control in patients that are taking high dose [[buprenorphine]] for chronic pain because it is the only opioid that has a potency and binding affinity strong enough to displace buprenorphine from the opioid receptors in the central nervous system and provide analgesia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pdr.net/drug-summary/fentanyl-citrate?druglabelid=2474|title=Fentanyl Citrate - Drug Summary - PDR.net|work=pdr.net|accessdate=23 October 2015}}</ref><ref>[[Buprenorphine]]</ref>

==Side effects==
It is essential for the administering medical professional to be trained in [[airway management]] with readily available airway equipment because the drug causes significant [[respiratory depression]] and may cause [[respiratory arrest]] if given too rapidly or in too high a dose. Other opioid side effects such as heart rhythm irregularity, blood pressure changes and nausea/vomiting can also be present in patients given this drug and should be dealt with accordingly.

Sufentanil has been associated with extremely rare instances of life-threatening [[anaphylaxis]].

==Overdose management==
Because sufentanil is very potent, practitioners must be prepared to reverse the effects of the drug should the patient exhibit symptoms of overdose such as [[respiratory depression]] or [[respiratory arrest]].  As for all other opioid-based medications, [[naloxone]] (trade name Narcan) is the definitive antidote for overdose.  Depending on the amount administered, it can reverse the respiratory depression and, if enough is administered, completely reverse the effects of sufentanil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rxlist.com/sufenta-drug/overdosage-contraindications.htm|title=Sufenta (Sufentanil Citrate Injection) Drug Information: Overdosage and Contraindications - Prescribing Information at RxList|work=RxList|accessdate=23 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://evzio.com/hcp/?gclid=CNC0mca_3sQCFQuMaQodggwAhQ|title=The First and Only Naloxone Auto-Injector EVZIO® (naloxone HCl injection)|work=evzio.com|accessdate=23 October 2015}}</ref>
