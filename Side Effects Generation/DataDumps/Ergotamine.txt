'''Ergotamine''' is an [[ergopeptine]] and part of the [[ergot]] family of [[alkaloid]]s; it is structurally and biochemically closely related to [[ergoline]]. It possesses structural similarity to several [[neurotransmitter]]s, and has [[biological activity]] as a [[vasoconstrictor]].

It is used [[Pharmacology|medicinally]] for treatment of acute [[migraine]] attacks (sometimes in combination with [[caffeine]]). Medicinal usage of ergot fungus began in the 16th century to induce [[childbirth]], yet dosage uncertainties discouraged the use. It has been used to prevent [[post-partum]] [[hemorrhage]] (bleeding after childbirth).  It was first isolated from the ergot fungus by [[Arthur Stoll]] at [[Sandoz]] in 1918 and marketed as Gynergen in 1921.<ref>AJ Giannini, AE Slaby. Drugs of Abuse. Oradell, NJ, Medical Economics Books, 1989.</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
The mechanism of action of ergotamine is complex.<ref name="pmid16041395">{{cite journal |vauthors=Walkembach J, Brüss M, Urban BW, Barann M |title=Interactions of metoclopramide and ergotamine with human 5-HT3A receptors and human 5-HT reuptake carriers |journal=Br. J. Pharmacol. |volume=146 |issue=4 |pages=543–52 |date=October 2005 |pmid=16041395 |pmc=1751187 |doi=10.1038/sj.bjp.0706351}}</ref> The molecule shares structural similarity with neurotransmitters such as [[serotonin]], [[dopamine]], and [[epinephrine]] and can thus bind to several [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] acting as an [[agonist]]. The anti-migraine effect is due to constriction of the intracranial extracerebral blood vessels through the [[5-HT1B receptor|5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptor]], and by inhibiting [[trigeminal nerve|trigeminal]] neurotransmission by [[5HT1D|5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors]]. Ergotamine also has effects on the [[dopamine]] and [[norepinephrine]] receptors. Its side effects are due mainly to its action at the [[D2 receptor|D2 dopamine]] and [[5HT1A|5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors]].<ref name="Tfelt">{{cite journal|vauthors=Tfelt-Hansen P, Saxena PR, Dahlof C, Pascual J, Lainez M, Henry P, Diener H, Schoenen J, Ferrari MD, Goadsby PJ |year=2000|title=Ergotamine in the acute treatment of migraine: a review and European consensus|journal= Brain|volume=123|pages=9–18|pmid=10611116|doi= 10.1093/brain/123.1.9}}</ref>

==Biosynthesis==
Ergotamine is a [[secondary metabolite]] ([[natural product]]) and the principal alkaloid produced by the ergot fungus, ''[[Claviceps purpurea]]'', and related fungi in the family [[Clavicipitaceae]].<ref>[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2011/12/pharmacognosy-of-ergot-argot-or-st-anthonys-fire/ Pharmacognosy of Ergot]</ref> Its biosynthesis in these fungi requires the [[amino acid]] <small>L</small>-[[tryptophan]] and [[dimethylallyl diphosphate]]. These precursor compounds are the substrates for the enzyme, [[tryptophan dimethylallyltransferase]], catalyzing the first step in ergot alkaloid biosynthesis, i.e., the [[prenylation]] of <small>L</small>-tryptophan. Further reactions, involving [[methyltransferase]] and [[oxygenase]] enzymes, yield the [[ergoline]], [[lysergic acid]]. Lysergic acid (LA) is the substrate of ''lysergyl peptide synthetase'', a [[Nonribosomal peptide|nonribosomal peptide synthetase]], which [[covalent]]ly links LA to the amino acids, <small>L</small>-[[alanine]], <small>L</small>-[[proline]], and <small>L</small>-[[phenylalanine]]. Enzyme-catalyzed or spontaneous cyclizations, [[Oxygenation (medicine)|oxygenations]]/[[oxidation]]s, and [[isomerization]]s at selected residues precede, and give rise to, formation of ergotamine.<ref name="Schardl">{{cite journal|vauthors=Schardl CL, Panaccione DG, Tudzynski P |year=2006|title=Ergot alkaloids--biology and molecular biology|journal= Alkaloids Chem. Biol.|volume=63|pages=45–86|pmid=17133714|doi=10.1016/S1099-4831(06)63002-2|series=The Alkaloids: Chemistry and Biology|isbn=978-0-12-469563-4}}</ref>

==Drug uses==
Ergotamine produces vasoconstriction peripherally as well as damages the peripheral epithelium.  In high doses, ergotamine is conducive to vascular stasis, [[thrombosis]], and [[gangrene]]. It can increase uterine contractivity and occasionally is used therapeutically immediately post-partum to decrease uterine bleeding. See also [[ergometrine]].

Ergotamine continues to be prescribed for migraines. The common form of prescription is Cafergot which is a combination of caffeine and ergotamine.

Contraindications include: [[atherosclerosis]], [[Buerger's syndrome]], [[coronary artery disease]], hepatic disease, pregnancy, [[pruritus]], [[Raynaud's syndrome]],  and renal disease.<ref>AJ Giannini. Biological Foundations of Clinical Psychiatry. Oradell, NJ. Medical Economics Puclishing Co., 1986.</ref>
It's also contraindicated if patient is taking [[Macrolide antibiotics]] (eg, [[erythromycin]]), certain HIV [[protease inhibitors]] (eg, [[ritonavir]], [[nelfinavir]], [[indinavir]]), certain azole antifungals (eg, [[ketoconazole]], [[itraconazole]], [[voriconazole]]) [[delavirdine]], [[efavirenz]] or a [[5-HT1 agonist]] (eg, [[sumatriptan]]).

==Availability and dosage==
In the United States, ergotamine is available as a suppository, a sublingual tablet, and a tablet, sometimes in combination with caffeine. The suppository is available under the brand name Migergot, which contains 2&nbsp;mg of ergotamine with 100&nbsp;mg caffeine.  The sublingual tablet is available under the brand name Ergomar and contains 2&nbsp;mg of ergotamine. The combination tablet in combination with caffeine called [[Cafergot]] contains 1&nbsp;mg of ergotamine and 100&nbsp;mg of caffeine.<ref>FDA Orange Book http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/docs/tempai.cfm</ref>

This preparation may be used immediately following the [[Aura (symptom)|aura]]/onset of pain to abort the migraine. For the best results, dosage should start at the first sign of an attack.<ref>http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=b4a06de6-f837-43a8-ae7a-aadb38dd2a7d#DA</ref>

==Side effects==
Side effects of ergotamine include nausea and vomiting. At higher doses, it can cause raised arterial [[blood pressure]], [[vasoconstriction]] (including [[coronary vasospasm]]) and [[bradycardia]] or [[tachycardia]]. Severe vasoconstriction may cause symptoms of [[intermittent claudication]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/pro/medihaler-ergotamine.html|title=Medihaler Ergotamine|website=[[drugs.com]]|accessdate=2016-05-20}}</ref>
