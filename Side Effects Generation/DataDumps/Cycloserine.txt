==Medical uses==

===Tuberculosis===
For the treatment of tuberculosis, cycloserine is classified as a second-line drug, i.e. its use is only considered if one or more first-line drugs cannot be used. Hence, cycloserine is restricted for use only against multiple drug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant strains of ''M. tuberculosis.'' Another reason for limited use of this drug is the neurological side effects it causes, since it is able to penetrate into the central nervous system (CNS) and cause headaches, drowsiness, [[depression (mood)|depression]], dizziness, [[vertigo]], confusion, [[paresthesias]], [[dysarthria]], hyperirritability, [[psychosis]], [[convulsions]], and shaking (tremors).<ref name="Nitsche - DCS-bg">{{cite journal|last=Nitsche|first=Michael|author2=Jaussi, W. |author3=Liebetanz, D. |author4=Lang, N. |author5=Tergau, F. |author6=Paulus, W. |title=Consolidation of human motor cortical neuroplasticity by D-cycloserine|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|year=2004|volume=29|issue=8|pages=1573–1578|PMID= 15199378|doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1300517}}</ref><ref name=NIH>{{cite web|title=CYCLOSERINE: Human Health Effects|url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/r?dbs+hsdb:@term+@rn+68-41-7|publisher=National Institutes of Health|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416080623/http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/r?dbs+hsdb%3A%40term+%40rn+68-41-7|archivedate=2014-04-16|df=}}</ref> Overdose of cycloserine may result in [[paresis]], [[seizures]], and [[coma]], while alcohol consumption may increase the risk of seizures.<ref name=NIH /> Coadministration of [[pyridoxine]] can reduce the incidence of some of these CNS side effects (e.g. convulsions) caused by cycloserine.

==Economics==
In the U.S., the price of cycloserine increased from $500 for 30 pills to $10,800 in 2015 after the Chao Center for Industrial Pharmacy and Contract Manufacturing changed ownership to Rodelis Therapeutics in August 2015.<ref name=NYT2015>{{cite news|author1=ANDREW POLLACK|title=Drug Goes From $13.50 a Tablet to $750, Overnight|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/21/business/a-huge-overnight-increase-in-a-drugs-price-raises-protests.html?ref=health&_r=0|accessdate=21 September 2015|date=20 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925195708/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/21/business/a-huge-overnight-increase-in-a-drugs-price-raises-protests.html?ref=health&_r=0|archivedate=25 September 2015|df=}}</ref>

The price increase was rescinded after the previous owner, the Purdue University Research Foundation, which retained "oversight of the manufacturing operation" intervened and Rodelis returned the drug to an NGO of Purdue University. The foundation now will charge $1,050 for 30 capsules, twice what it charged before". [[Eli Lilly]] has been criticised for not ensuring that the philanthropic initiative continued. Due to US antitrust laws however, no company may control the price of a product after it is outlicensed.<ref name=NYT2015B/>
