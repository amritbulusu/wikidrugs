'''MDAI''' ('''5,6-methylenedioxy-2-aminoindane''') is a [[drug]] developed in the 1990s by a team led by [[David E. Nichols]] at [[Purdue University]]. It acts as a non-[[neurotoxic]] and highly [[binding selectivity|selective]] [[selective serotonin releasing agent|serotonin releasing agent]] (SSRA) ''[[in vitro]]'' and produces [[entactogen]] effects in humans.

== Chemistry ==

The [[chemical structure]] of MDAI is indirectly derived from that of the illicit drug [[3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine|MDA]], but the alpha-[[methyl group]] of the [[alkyl]] [[amino]] [[amphetamine]] side chain has been bound back to the [[benzene]] nucleus to form an [[indane]] ring system, which changes its pharmacological properties substantially.

MDAI can be produced from 3-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)propionic acid<ref name="nichols MDAI">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jm00164a037| title = Nonneurotoxic tetralin and indan analogs of 3,4-(methylenedioxy)amphetamine (MDA)| journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry| volume = 33| issue = 2| pages = 703–10| year = 1990| last1 = Nichols | first1 = D.

Treatment of the indanone with amyl nitrite in methanol with HCl afforded the hydroxyimino ketone.

==Pharmacology==

MDAI has been shown to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine with [[IC50|IC<sub>50</sub>]] values of 512&nbsp;nM, 5,920&nbsp;nM, and 1,426&nbsp;nM, respectively. This demonstrates that MDAI has selective affinity for the [[serotonin transporter]] (SERT). In animals treated with [[reserpine]] and MDAI, greater extracellular concentrations of [[Monoamine neurotransmitter|monoamine neural transmitters]] resulted, most significantly serotonin. This result indicates that MDAI is a potent releaser of serotonin, while effectively inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin.  For comparison, MDAI is similar in potency with releasing serotonin to MDA but significantly less potent than [[MDMA]].<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid=1685125| year=1991| author1=Johnson| first1=M.

=== Effects ===

The family of drugs typified by [[MDMA]] produce their effects through multiple mechanisms of action in the body, and consequently produce three distinct cues which animals can be trained to respond to: a stimulant cue typified by drugs such as [[methamphetamine]], a psychedelic cue typified by drugs such as [[LSD]] and [[2,5-Dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine|DOM]], and an "entactogen-like" cue which is produced by drugs such as MDAI and [[MBDB]]. These drugs cause drug-appropriate responses in animals trained to recognize the effects of MDMA, but do not produce responses in animals trained selectively to respond to stimulants or hallucinogens. Because these compounds selectively release serotonin in the brain but have little effect on dopamine or noradrenaline levels, they can produce empathogenic effects but without any stimulant action, instead being somewhat sedating.<ref>{{Cite journal |pmid = 2886126|year = 1987|author1 = Steele|first1 = T.

== Use in scientific research ==

MDAI and other similar drugs have been widely used in scientific research, as they are able to replicate many of the effects of MDMA, but without causing the [[neurotoxicity]] which may be associated with MDMA and some related drugs.

==Use as a recreational drug==
MDAI has been advertised as a [[designer drug]]. It started to be sold online from around 2007, but reached peak popularity between about 2010-2012, after bans on [[mephedrone]] came into effect in various countries. Internet-sourced products claimed to be MDAI have been shown variously to contain [[mephedrone]] or other [[substituted cathinone]] derivatives, and mixed compositions of inorganic substances, while generally containing no MDAI. The number of internet searches for MDAI has been considerably higher in the UK compared to Germany and the USA.<ref>{{Cite journal
