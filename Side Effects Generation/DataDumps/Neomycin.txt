'''Neomycin''' is an [[aminoglycoside]] [[antibiotic]] found in many topical medications such as creams, ointments, and eyedrops. The discovery of neomycin dates back to 1949. It was discovered in the lab of [[Selman Waksman]]. Neomycin belongs to aminoglycoside class of antibiotics that contain two or more aminosugars connected by glycosidic bonds.

==Uses==
Neomycin is typically used as a [[topical]] preparation, such as [[Neosporin]]. It can also be given orally, where it is usually combined with other antibiotics. Neomycin is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and has been used as a preventive measure for [[hepatic encephalopathy]] and [[hypercholesterolemia]]. By killing bacteria in the intestinal tract, it keeps ammonia levels low and prevents hepatic encephalopathy, especially prior to GI surgery.  It has also been used to treat [[small intestinal bacterial overgrowth]].  It is not given via injection, as neomycin is extremely [[nephrotoxic]] (causes [[kidney]] damage), even when compared to other [[aminoglycoside]]s. The exception is when neomycin is included, in very small quantities, as a preservative in some vaccines – typically 25&nbsp;mg per dose.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16242081 |url=http://journals.lww.com/dermatitis/Abstract/2005/09000/Hypersensitivity_Reactions_to_Vaccine_Components.4.aspx |year=2005 |last1=Heidary |first1=Noushin |title=Hypersensitivity reactions to vaccine components |journal=Dermatitis |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=115–20 |last2=Cohen |first2=David E. |doi=10.1097/01206501-200509000-00004}}</ref>

==Molecular biology==
Neomycin resistance is conferred by either one of two aminoglycoside phosphotransferase genes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bio.net/bionet/mm/methods/1999-March/073912.html|title=G418/neomycin-cross resistance?|accessdate=2008-10-19}}</ref> A ''neo'' gene is commonly included in DNA [[plasmid]]s used by molecular biologists to establish stable mammalian [[cell line]]s expressing cloned proteins in culture; many commercially available protein expression plasmids contain ''neo'' as a [[selectable marker]]. Non-[[transfect]]ed cells will eventually die off when the culture is treated with neomycin or similar antibiotic. Neomycin or [[kanamycin]] can be used for [[prokaryotes]], but [[geneticin]] (G418) is, in general, needed for [[eukaryotes]].

Neomycin binds to the 30S subunit of the [[ribosome]] and inhibits translation of proteins from mRNA.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00284-002-3945-9 |pmid=14570276 |title=Neomycin and Paromomycin Inhibit 30S Ribosomal Subunit Assembly in Staphylococcus aureus |journal=Current Microbiology |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=237–43 |year=2003 |last1=Mehta |first1=Roopal |last2=Champney |first2=W.

==Biosynthetic pathway==
First isolated from the ''Streptomyces fradiae''  and ''Streptomyces albogriseus'' in 1949 (NBRC 12773) <ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1172/JCI102182 |pmid=16695766 |pmc=438928 |title=Neomycin—Production and Antibiotic Properties 123 |journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume=28 |issue=5 Pt 1 |pages=934–9 |year=1949 |last1=Waksman |first1=Selman A. |last2=Lechevalier |first2=Hubert A. |last3=Harris |first3=Dale A. }}</ref>. Neomycin is a mixture of neomycin B (framycetin);   and its epimer neomycin  C, the latter component accounting for some 5–15% of the mixture. Neomycin has good activity against [[Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative bacteria]], but is very [[ototoxic]]. Its use is thus restricted to oral treatment of intestinal infections.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dewick M.|first1=Dewick|title=Dr.|date=March 2009|publisher=John Wiley and Sons Ltd.|location=The Atrium, Southern Gate, Chichester,  West  Sussex,  PO19  8SQ,  United Kingdom  (Page 4).|isbn=978-0-470-74168-9|pages=508, 510, 511|edition=3rd}}</ref>

Neomycin B is composed of four parts: D-neosamine, 2-deoxystreptamine (2-DOS), D-ribose, and L-neosamine.

Neomycin A, also called neamine, contains D-neosamine and 2-deoxystreptamine. Neamine is made from six genes, DOIS gene (btrC, neo7); L-glutamine:DOI aminotransferase gene (btrS, neo6); a putative glycosyltransferase gene (btrM, neo8); a putative aminotransferase (similar to glutamate-1-semialdehyde 2,1- aminomutase) gene (btrB, neo18); a putative alcohol dehydrogenase gene (btrE, neo5); another putative dehydrogenase (similar to chorine dehydrogenase and related flavoproteins) gene (btrQ, neo11).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ja.2005.104 |pmid=16506694 |title=Biosynthesis of 2-Deoxystreptamine by Three Crucial Enzymes in Streptomyces fradiae NBRC 12773 |journal=The Journal of Antibiotics |volume=58 |issue=12 |pages=766–74 |year=2005 |last1=Kudo |first1=Fumitaka |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Yasuhito |last3=Yokoyama |first3=Kenichi |last4=Eguchi |first4=Tadashi |last5=Kakinuma |first5=Katsumi }}</ref>  A deacetylase acting to remove the acetyl group on N-acetylglucosamine moieties of [[aminoglycoside]] intermediates (Neo16), still needs to be clarified (sequence similar to BtrD).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nchembio.671 |pmid=21983602 |title=Discovery of parallel pathways of kanamycin biosynthesis allows antibiotic manipulation |journal=Nature Chemical Biology |volume=7 |issue=11 |pages=843–52 |year=2011 |last1=Park |first1=Je Won |last2=Park |first2=Sung Ryeol |last3=Nepal |first3=Keshav Kumar |last4=Han |first4=Ah Reum |last5=Ban |first5=Yeon Hee |last6=Yoo |first6=Young Ji |last7=Kim |first7=Eun Ji |last8=Kim |first8=Eui Min |last9=Kim |first9=Dooil |last10=Sohng |first10=Jae Kyung |last11=Yoon |first11=Yeo Joon }}</ref>

Next is the attachment of the D-ribose via [[ribosylation]] of neamine, using 5-phosphoribosyl-1-diphosphate (PRPP) as the ribosyl donor (BtrL, BtrP);<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bmc.2007.04.040 |pmid=17482823 |title=Unique O-ribosylation in the biosynthesis of butirosin |journal=Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry |volume=15 |issue=13 |pages=4360–8 |year=2007 |last1=Kudo |first1=Fumitaka |last2=Fujii |first2=Takuya |last3=Kinoshita |first3=Shunsuke |last4=Eguchi |first4=Tadashi }}</ref> glycosyltransferase (potential homologues RibF, LivF, Parf) gene (Neo15).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/B808734B |pmid=18802637 |title=The neomycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces fradiae NCIMB 8233: Genetic and biochemical evidence for the roles of two glycosyltransferases and a deacetylase |journal=Organic & Biomolecular Chemistry |volume=6 |issue=18 |pages=3306–14 |year=2008 |last1=Fan |first1=Qingzhi |last2=Huang |first2=Fanglu |last3=Leadlay |first3=Peter F. |last4=Spencer |first4=Jonathan B. }}</ref>

Neosamine B (L-neosamine B) is most likely biosynthesized in the same manner as the neosamine C (D-niosamine) in neamine biosynthesis, but with an additional [[epimerization]] step required to account for the presence of the epimeric neosamine B in neomycin B.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/B604709M |pmid=17119636 |title=Biosynthesis of 2-deoxystreptamine-containing aminoglycoside antibiotics |journal=Natural Product Reports |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=864–74 |year=2006 |last1=Llewellyn |first1=Nicholas M. |last2=Spencer |first2=Jonathan B. }}</ref>

==Spectrum==
Similar to other aminoglycosides, neomycin has excellent activity against [[Gram-negative bacteria]], and is partially effective against [[Gram-positive bacteria]].  It is relatively toxic to humans, and many people have allergic reactions to it.<ref>{{DermNet|dermatitis/neomycin-allergy}}</ref> See: [[Hypersensitivity]]. Physicians sometimes recommend using antibiotic ointments without neomycin, such as [[Polysporin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dermadoctor.com/article_Your-Medicine-Cabinet_43.html| title=Your Medicine Cabinet | publisher=DERMAdoctor.com, Inc. |accessdate=2008-10-19}}</ref> The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant Gram-negative bacteria.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.toku-e.com/Assets/MIC/Neomycin%20sulfate%20EP.pdf | title=Neomycin sulfate, EP Susceptibility and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) Data | publisher=TOKU-E}}</ref>

==Composition==
Standard grade neomycin is composed of a number of related compounds including [[neomycin A]] (neamine), neomycin B (framycetin), neomycin C, and a few minor compounds found in much lower quantities.  Neomycin B is the most active component in neomycin followed by neomycin C and neomycin A.  Neomycin A is an inactive degradation product of the C and B isomers.<ref>Cammack, R. Attwood, T. K.

==History==
Neomycin was discovered in 1949 by the microbiologist [[Selman Waksman]] and his student Hubert Lechevalier at Rutgers University. It is produced naturally by the bacterium ''[[Streptomyces fradiae]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1952/waksman-bio.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1952|publisher=Nobel Foundation|accessdate=2008-10-29}}</ref>  Synthesis requires specific nutrient conditions in either stationary or submerged aerobic conditions. The compound is then isolated and purified from the bacterium.<ref>"Neomycin." Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Encyclopedia (3rd edition) Volume 3. (2007): 2415–2416. Knovel.com.
