'''Carvedilol''', sold under the brand name '''Coreg''' among others, is a [[beta blocker]] used for treating mild to severe [[congestive heart failure]] (CHF), left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) following heart attack in people who are otherwise stable, and for treating [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/020297s029lbl.pdf|title = Coreg - Food and Drug Administration|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>

Beta blockers block the beta receptors on heart muscle and other cells, making them more relaxed and less responsive to stress hormones. Carvedilol also blocks alpha receptors, which are found on blood vessels, and relaxes the blood vessels, dilating them, which lowers blood pressure and vascular resistance. 

It is a [[beta blocker|nonselective beta blocker]]/[[alpha-1 blocker]] and belongs to the third generation of beta blockers.

Carvedilol was discovered by Fritz Wiedemann at [[Boehringer Mannheim]] and was initially approved in the U.S. in 1995.<ref>U.S. Patent 4503067</ref> On October 20, 2006, the FDA approved an extended-release formulation.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title = Drug Approval Package|url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2006/022012s000TOC.cfm|website = www.accessdata.fda.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}</ref>

== Medical use ==
Carvedilol is indicated in the management of [[congestive heart failure]] (CHF), commonly as an adjunct to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor ([[ACE inhibitor]]s) and [[diuretic]]s. It has been clinically shown to reduce mortality and hospitalizations in people with CHF.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/early/2013/06/03/CIR.0b013e31829e8776.full.pdf|title = 2013 AHA Guidelines for the Management of Heart Failure|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> The mechanism behind its positive effect when used long-term in clinically stable CHF patients is not fully understood, but is thought to contribute to remodeling of the heart, improving upon its structure and function.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Basic and Clinical Pharmacology 11th Edition|last = Biaggioni, MD|first = Italo|publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical Publishing Division|year = 2009|isbn = 9780071604055|location = New York|pages = 189}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Reis Filho|first1=JR|last2=Cardoso|first2=JN|last3=Cardoso|first3=CM|last4=Pereira-Barretto|first4=AC|title=Reverse Cardiac Remodeling: A Marker of Better Prognosis in Heart Failure.|journal=Arquivos brasileiros de cardiologia|date=June 2015|volume=104|issue=6|pages=502-6|pmid=26131706|doi=10.5935/abc.20150025|pmc=4484683}}</ref>

In addition, carvedilol is indicated in the treatment of hypertension and to reduce risk of mortality and hospitalizations in a subset of people following a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sackner-Bernstein|first1=JD|title=Practical guidelines to optimize effectiveness of beta-blockade in patients postinfarction and in those with chronic heart failure.|journal=The American journal of cardiology|date=6 May 2004|volume=93|issue=9A|pages=69B-73B|pmid=15144942|doi=10.1016/j.amjcard.2004.01.029}}</ref> It can be used alone or with other anti-hypertensive agents.

== Side effects ==

The most common side effects (>10% incidence) include:<ref name=":0" />
* [[dizziness]]
* [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]]
* [[hypotension|low blood pressure]]
* [[diarrhea]]
* [[asthenia|weakness]]
* [[bradycardia|slowed heart rate]]
* [[weight gain]]
* [[erectile dysfunction]]
Carvedilol is not recommended for people with uncontrolled bronchospastic disease (e.g. current asthma symptoms) as it can block receptors that assist in opening the airways.<ref name=":0" />

Carvedilol may mask symptoms of low blood sugar ([[hypoglycemia]]),<ref name=":0" /> resulting in [[diabetic hypoglycemia#Unawareness|hypoglycemia unawareness]]. This is termed [[diabetic hypoglycemia#Beta blockers|beta blocker induced hypoglycemia unawareness]].

== Contraindications ==
According to the FDA, carvedilol should not be used in people with bronchial asthma or bronchospastic conditions. It should not be used in people with second- or third-degree AV block, sick sinus syndrome, severe bradycardia (unless a permanent pacemaker is in place), or a decompensated heart condition. People with severe hepatic impairment are also advised to not take carvedilol.<ref>{{cite web|title=Carvedilol Package Insert|url=https://www.gsksource.com/pharma/content/dam/GlaxoSmithKline/US/en/Prescribing_Information/Coreg/pdf/COREG-PI-PIL.PDF}}</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==

Carvedilol is both a non-selective [[Beta-adrenergic receptor blocker|beta adrenergic receptor blocker]] (β1, β2) and an [[Alpha blocker|alpha adrenergic receptor blocker]] (α1). The S(-) enantiomer accounts for the beta blocking activity whereas the S(-) and R(+) enantiomer have alpha blocking activity.<ref name=":0" />

Carvedilol reversibly binds to beta adrenergic receptors on cardiac myocytes. Inhibition of these receptors prevents a response to the [[sympathetic nervous system]], leading to decreased heart rate and contractility. This action is beneficial in heart failure patients where the sympathetic nervous system is activated as a compensatory mechanism.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.inaactamedica.org/archives/2007/17297209.pdf|title = Beta Blockers for Congestive Heart Failure|last = Manurung|first = Daulat|date = 2007|journal = Acta medica Indonesiana|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>

Carvedilol blockade of α1 receptors causes [[vasodilation]] of blood vessels. This inhibition leads to decreased peripheral vascular resistance and an antihypertensive effect. There is no reflex tachycardia response due to carvedilol blockade of β1 receptors on the heart.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The pharmacology of carvedilol|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01409471|journal = European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology|date = 1990-03-01|issn = 0031-6970|pages = S82-S88|volume = 38|issue = 2|doi = 10.1007/BF01409471|first = Dr R. R. Ruffolo|last = Jr|first2 = M.|last2 = Gellai|first3 = J. P.|last3 = Hieble|first4 = R. N.|last4 = Willette|first5 = A. J.|last5 = Nichols}}</ref>

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Carvedilol is about 25% to 35% bioavailable following oral administration due to extensive first-pass metabolism. The compound is metabolized by liver enzymes, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 via aromatic ring oxidation and glucuronidation, then further conjugated by glucuronidation and sulfation. Compared with the parent compound, the three active metabolites exhibits only one-tenth of the vasodilating effect of the parent compound. However, the 4’hydroxyphenyl metabolite is about 13-fold more potent in ß-blockade than the parent compound.<ref name=":0" />

The mean half-life of carvedilol following oral administration ranges from 7 to 10 hours. Carvedilol has two enantiomers: R(+)-carvedilol and  S(-)-carvedilol. R(+)-carvedilol undergoes preferential selection for metabolism, so the mean half-life of the enantiomer is about 5 to 9 hours compared with 7 to 11 hours for the S(-)-enantiomer.<ref name=":0" />

The majority of carvedilol is bound to plasma proteins (98%), mainly to albumin. Carvedilol is a basic, hydrophobic compound with a steady-state volume of distribution of 115 L. Plasma clearance ranges from 500 to 700 mL/min.<ref name=":0" />

Absorption is slowed when administered with food, however, it does not show a significant difference in bioavailability. Taking carvedilol with food decreases the risk of orthostatic hypotension.<ref name=":0" />
