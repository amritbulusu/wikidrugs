Romosozumab was originally discovered by [[Celltech]] (now owned by [[UCB (company)|UCB]]).<ref>Osteocyte control of bone formation via sclerostin, a novel BMP antagonist. EMBO J. 2003 Dec 1;22(23):6267-76.</ref> Celltech entered in a partnership with [[Amgen]] in 2002 for the product's development.<ref>Celltech group Annual Report and Accounts 2002</ref>

In 2016 results from 12 months of a clinical study were reported.<ref>{{Cite journal |author = Cosman et al. |title = Romosozumab Treatment in Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis |journal = [[The New England journal of medicine]] |year = 2016 |pmid = 27641143}}</ref>
