=== Special Populations ===

==== Pregnancy ====
It has not been shown to cause birth defects in animal studies when given intravenously. There are no controlled studies to show if pentamidine can harm the fetus in pregnant women. It is only recommended if the drug of choice trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is contraindicated.<ref name=":12">{{Cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/pregnancy/pentamidine.html|title=Pentamidine Use During Pregnancy {{!}} Drugs.com|website=www.drugs.com|access-date=2016-11-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109153337/https://www.drugs.com/pregnancy/pentamidine.html|archivedate=2016-11-09|df=}}</ref>

==== Breastfeeding  ====
There is no information regarding the excretion of pentamidine in breast milk, but since the adverse effects on breastfed infants are unknown currently, it is recommended by the manufacturer for the infant to not be breastfed or for the mother to stop the drug. Risks versus benefits for the mother should be considered when making this decision.<ref name=":12" />

==== Children ====
Pentamidine can be used in the prevention of PCP in children with HIV who cannot tolerate [[Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole|Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole]] and can use a nebulizer. Intranvenous solutions of pentamidine should only be used in children with HIV older than 2 years old when other treatments are unavailable<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|url=https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines/html/5/pediatric-oi-prevention-and-treatment-guidelines/415/pneumocystis-jirovecii-pneumonia|title=Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia {{!}} Pediatric OI Prevention and Treatment Guidelines {{!}} AIDSinfo|website=AIDSinfo|access-date=2016-11-07|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107155510/https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines/html/5/pediatric-oi-prevention-and-treatment-guidelines/415/pneumocystis-jirovecii-pneumonia|archivedate=2016-11-07|df=}}</ref>

==Contraindications==
* Patients with a history of anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity to pentamidine isethionate<ref name=":10" /><!--PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER-->

==Side effects==

=== Common ===
* Burning pain, dryness, or sensation of lump in throat
* Chest pain
* Coughing
* difficulty in breathing
* difficulty in swallowing
* skin rash
* wheezing<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/sfx/pentamidine-side-effects.html|title=Pentamidine Side Effects in Detail - Drugs.com|website=www.drugs.com|access-date=2016-11-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104142210/https://www.drugs.com/sfx/pentamidine-side-effects.html|archivedate=2016-11-04|df=}}</ref>

=== Rare ===
* Nausea and vomiting
* Pain in upper abdomen, possibly radiating to the back
* Severe pain in side of chest 
* Shortness of breath<ref name=":4" />

=== Others ===
* [[Blood]]: Pentamidine frequently causes [[leukopenia]] and less often [[thrombopenia]], which may cause symptomatic bleeding. Some cases of [[anemia]], possibly related to [[folic acid]] deficiency, have been described.<ref name=":4" />
* [[Cardiovascular system|Cardiovascular]]: [[Hypotension]], which may be severe. Severe or fatal [[arrhythmia]]s and [[heart failure]] are quite frequent.<ref name=":10" />
* [[Kidney]]: 25 percent develop signs of [[nephrotoxicity]] ranging from mild, asymptomatic [[azotemia]] (increased serum [[creatinine]] and [[urea]]) to irreversible [[renal failure]]. Ample fluids or intravenous hydration may prevent some nephrotoxicity.<ref name=":10" />
* [[Liver]]: Elevated [[liver enzymes]] are associated with intravenous use of pentamidine. [[Hepatomegaly]] and [[hepatitis]] have been encountered with long term prophylactic use of pentamidine inhalation.<ref name=":10" />
* [[Nervous system|Neurological]]:  Dizziness, drowsiness, [[neuralgia]], confusion, hallucinations, [[seizure]]s and other central side effects are reported.<ref name=":10" />
* [[Pancreas]]: [[Hypoglycemia]] that requires symptomatic treatment is frequently seen. On the other hand, pentamidine may cause or worsen [[diabetes mellitus]].<ref name=":10" />
* [[Respiratory system|Respiratory]]: Cough and [[bronchospasm]], most frequently seen with inhalation.<ref name=":10" />
* [[Skin]]: Severe local reactions after extravasculation of intravenous solutions or following intramuscular injection treatment have been seen. Pentamidine itself may cause rash, or rarely [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]] or [[Toxic epidermal necrolysis|Lyell syndrome]].<ref name=":10" />
* Eye discomfort, [[conjunctivitis]], throat irritation, [[splenomegaly]], [[Herxheimer reaction]], [[electrolyte]] imbalances (e.g. [[hypocalcemia]]).<ref name=":10" />

==Drug interactions==
The additional or sequential use of other nephrotoxic drugs like [[aminoglycoside]]s, [[amphotericin B]], [[capreomycin]], [[colistin]], [[polymyxin B]], [[vancomycin]], [[foscarnet]], or [[cisplatin]] should be closely monitored, or whenever possible completely avoided.<ref name=":10" />

==Mechanism of action==
The mechanism seems to vary with different organisms and is not well understood. However, pentamidine is suspected to work through various methods of interference of critical functions in DNA, RNA, phospholipid and protein synthesis.<ref name=":10" /><ref name=":6" /> Pentamidine binds to [[adenine]]-[[thymine]]-rich regions of the ''[[Trypanosoma brucei|Trypanosoma]]'' parasite DNA, forming a cross-link between two adenines four to five base pairs apart. The drug also inhibits [[topoisomerase]] enzymes in the mitochondria of ''[[Pneumocystis jirovecii]]''. Similarly, pentamidine inhibits [[type II topoisomerase]] in the mitochondria of the ''[[Trypanosoma brucei|Trypanosoma]]'' parasite, resulting in breaks and unraveling it's circular mitochondrial DNA.<ref name=":6">{{Cite book|title=Foye's Principles of Medicinal Chemistry (Seventh ed.)|last=Lemke, Thomas L.; Williams, David A., eds.|first=|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|year=2013|isbn=9781609133450|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>

=== Resistance ===
Strains of the ''[[Trypanosoma brucei]]'' parasite that are resistant to pentamidine have been discovered. Pentamidine is brought into the mitochondria through carriers, and the absence of these carriers prevents the drug from reaching its site of action.<ref name=":6" />

== Pharmacokinetics ==
'''Absorption:''' Pentamidine is completely absorbed when given intravenously or intramuscularly. When inhaled through a nebulizer, pentamidine accumulates in the [[bronchoalveolar fluid]] of the lungs at a higher concentration compared to injections. The inhaled form is minimally absorbed in the blood.<ref name=":11" /> Absorption is unreliable when given orally.<ref name=":1" />

'''Distribution:''' When injected, pentamidine binds to tissues and proteins in the plasma. It accumulates in the kidney, liver, lungs, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands.<ref name=":2" /> Additionally, pentamidine does not reach curative levels in the [[cerebrospinal fluid]].<ref name=":1" /> It has a volume of distribution of 286-1356 liters when given intravenously and 1658-3790 liters when given intramuscularly.<ref name=":7">{{Cite web|url=http://reference.medscape.com/drug/nebupent-pentam-pentamidine-342568#10|title=NebuPent, Pentam (pentamidine) dosing, indications, interactions, adverse effects, and more|website=reference.medscape.com|access-date=2016-11-06|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106185759/http://reference.medscape.com/drug/nebupent-pentam-pentamidine-342568#10|archivedate=2016-11-06|df=}}</ref> Inhaled pentamidine is mainly deposited into the [[bronchoalveolar lavage fluid]] of the lungs.<ref name=":2" />

'''Metabolism:''' Pentamidine is primarily metabolized by [[Cytochrome P450]] enzymes in the liver.<ref name=":7" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/pentamidine#section=DrugBank-Interactions&fullscreen=true|title=pentamidine {{!}} C19H24N4O2 - PubChem|last=Pubchem|website=pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2016-11-06|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107011758/https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/pentamidine#section=DrugBank-Interactions&fullscreen=true|archivedate=2016-11-07|df=}}</ref> Up to 12% of pentamidine is eliminated in the urine unchanged.<ref name=":10" />

'''Elimination:''' Pentamidine has an average half-life of 5–8 hours when given intravenously and 7–11 hours when given intramuscularly. However, these may increase with severe kidney problems.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/ppa/pentamidine-oral-inhalation.html|title=Pentamidine (Oral Inhalation) (Professional Patient Advice) - Drugs.com|website=www.drugs.com|access-date=2016-11-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104142839/https://www.drugs.com/ppa/pentamidine-oral-inhalation.html|archivedate=2016-11-04|df=}}</ref> Pentamidine can remain in the system for as long as 8 months after the first injection.<ref name=":6" />

== Chemistry ==
Pentamidine isethionate for injection is commercially available as a [[Freeze-drying|lypophilized]], white crystalline powder for reconstitution with sterile water or 5% Dextrose. After reconstitution, the mixture should be free from discoloration and precipitation. Reconstitution with sodium chloride should be avoided due to formation of precipitates. Intravenous solutions of pentamidine can be mixed with intravenous HIV medications like [[Zidovudine|zidovidine]] and intravenous heart medications like [[diltiazem]]. However, intravenous solutions of antiviral [[foscarnet]] and antifungal [[fluconazole]] are incompatible with pentamidine.<ref name=":10" /> To avoid side-effects associated with intravenous administration, the solution should be slowly infused to minimize the release of [[histamine]].<ref name=":6" />

==History==
Pentamidine was first used to treat [[African trypanosomiasis]] in 1937 and [[leishmaniasis]] in 1940 before it was registered as pentamidine mesylate in 1950. Its efficacy against [[Pneumocystis jirovecii]] was demonstrated in 1987, following its re-emergence on the drug market in 1984 in the current isethionate form.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/trypanosomiasis_african/drugs/en/|title=Drugs|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819074511/http://www.who.int/trypanosomiasis_african/drugs/en/|archivedate=2016-08-19|df=}}</ref>
