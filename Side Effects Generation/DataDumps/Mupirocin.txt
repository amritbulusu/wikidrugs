===Resistance===
Shortly after the clinical use of mupirocin began, strains of ''Staphylococcus aureus'' that were [[drug resistance|resistant]] to mupirocin emerged, with [[nares]] clearance rates of less than 30% success.<ref name="pmid9511032">{{cite journal |author=Cookson BD |title=The emergence of mupirocin resistance: a challenge to infection control and antibiotic prescribing practice |journal=J.

Most strains of ''[[Propionibacterium acnes]]'', a causative agent of the skin disease [[acne vulgaris]], are naturally resistant to mupirocin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://scienceofacne.com/antibiotic-susceptibility-of-propionibacterium-acnes/ |title=Antibiotic Susceptibility of Propionibacterium acnes. |publisher=ScienceOfAcne.com |date=2011-06-11 |accessdate=2012-08-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729063418/http://scienceofacne.com/antibiotic-susceptibility-of-propionibacterium-acnes/ |archivedate=2012-07-29 |df= }}</ref>

The mechanism of mupirocin differs from other clinical antibiotics, rendering cross-resistance to other antibiotics unlikely.<ref name="pmid9511032"/> However, the MupA gene may co-transfer with other antibacterial resistance genes. This has been observed already with resistance genes for [[triclosan]], [[tetracycline]], and [[trimethoprim]].<ref name="pmid9511032"/>  It may also result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms.

==Mechanism==
Mupirocin reversibly binds to the isoleucyl t-RNA synthetase in ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' and ''Streptococcus'', resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis.  [[DNA]] and cell wall formation are also negatively impacted to a lesser degree.<ref name="pmid659331">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hughes J, Mellows G |title=On the mode of action of pseudomonic acid: inhibition of protein synthesis in Staphylococcus aureus |journal=J.

===Biosynthesis of pseudomonic acid A===
The 74 kb mupirocin [[gene cluster]] contains six [[protein domain|multi-domain]] [[enzymes]] and twenty-six other peptides (Table 1).<ref name="pmid12770824">{{cite journal |vauthors=El-Sayed AK, Hothersall J, Cooper SM, Stephens E, Simpson TJ, Thomas CM |title=Characterization of the mupirocin biosynthesis gene cluster from Pseudomonas fluorescens NCIMB 10586 |journal=Chem.

The mupirocin cluster exhibits an atypical [[acyltransferase]] (AT) organization, in that there are only two AT domains, and both are found on the same protein, MmpC. These AT domains are the only domains present on MmpC, while the other three type I PKS proteins contain no AT domains.<ref name="pmid12770824"/> The mupirocin pathway also contains several tandem [[acyl carrier protein]] doublets or triplets. This may be an adaptation to increase the throughput rate or to bind multiple substrates simultaneously.<ref name="pmid12770824"/>

Pseudomonic acid A is the product of an [[esterification]] between the 17C polyketide monic acid and the 9C [[fatty acid]] 9-hydroxy-nonanoic acid. The possibility that the entire molecule is assembled as a single polyketide with a [[Baeyer-Villiger]] [[oxidation]] inserting an [[oxygen]] into the carbon backbone has been ruled out because C1 of monic acid and C9' of 9-hydroxy-nonanoic acid are both derived from C1 of acetate.<ref name="pmid402372">{{cite journal |vauthors=Feline TC, Jones RB, Mellows G, Phillips L |title=Pseudomonic acid.

===Monic acid biosynthesis===
Biosynthesis of the 17C monic acid unit begins on MmpD (Figure 1).<ref name="pmid12770824"/> One of the AT domains from MmpC may transfer an activated acetyl group from acetyl-Coenzyme A (CoA) to the first ACP domain. The chain is extended by malonyl-CoA, followed by a SAM-dependent methylation at C12 (see Figure 2 for PA-A numbering) and reduction of the B-keto group to an alcohol. The dehydration (DH) domain in module 1 is predicted to be non-functional due to a mutation in the conserved active site region. Module 2 adds another two carbons by malonyl-CoA extender unit, followed by ketoreduction (KR) and dehydration. Module three adds a malonyl-CoA extender unit, followed by SAM-dependent methylation at C8, ketoreduction, and dehydration. Module 4 extends the molecule with a malonyl-CoA unit followed by ketoreduction.

Assembly of monic acid is continued by the transfer of the 12C product of MmpD to MmpA.<ref name="pmid12770824"/> Two more rounds of extension with malonyl-CoA units are achieved by module 5 and 6. Module 5 also contains a KR domain.

===Post-PKS tailoring===

The keto group at C3 is replaced with a methyl group in a multi-step reaction (Figure 3). MupG begins by decarboxylating a malonyl-ACP. The alpha carbon of the resulting acetyl-ACP is linked to C3 of the polyketide chain by MupH. This intermediate is dehydrated and decarboxylated by MupJ and MupK, respectively.<ref name="pmid12770824"/>

The formation of the [[pyran]] ring requires many enzyme-mediated steps (Figure 4). The double bond between C8 and C9 is proposed to migrate to between C8 and C16.<ref name="pmid16039529">{{cite journal |author=Cooper SM |title=Shift to Pseudomonic acid B production in P. fluorescens NCIMB10586 by mutation of mupirocin tailoring genes mupO, mupU, mupV, and macpE |journal=Chem.

The [[epoxide]] of PA-A at C10-11 is believed to be inserted after pyran formation by a [[cytochrome P450]] such as MupO.<ref name="pmid12770824"/> A gene knockout of mupO abolished PA-A production but PA-B, which also conatins the C10-C11 epoxide, remained.<ref name="pmid16039529"/> This indicates that MupO is either not involved or is not essential for this epoxidation step.

===9-Hydroxy-nonanoic acid biosynthesis===

The nine-carbon fatty acid 9-hydroxy-nonanoic acid (9-HN) is derived as a separate compound and later esterified to monic acid to form pseudomonic acid. <sup>13</sup>C labeled [[acetate]] feeding has shown that C1-C6 are constructed with acetate in the canonical fashion of [[fatty acid synthesis]]. C7' shows only C1 labeling of acetate, while C8' and C9' show a reversed pattern of 13C labeled acetate.<ref name="pmid402372"/> It is speculated that C7-C9 arises from a 3-hydroxypropionate starter unit, which is extended three times with malonyl-CoA and fully reduced to yield 9-HN. It has also been suggested that 9-HN is initiated by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid (HMG). This latter theory was not supported by feeding of [3-<sup>14</sup>C] or [3,6-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>]-HMG.<ref>{{cite journal| last1 = Martin | first1 = FM| last2 = Simpson | first2 = TJ| doi = 10.1039/P19890000207| title = Biosynthetic studies on pseudomonic acid (mupirocin), a novel antibiotic metabolite of Pseudomonas fluorescens| journal = Journal of the Chemical Society, Perkin Transactions 1| pages = 207–209| year = 1989 | issue=1}}</ref>

It is proposed that MmpB to catalyzes the synthesis of 9-HN (Figure 5). MmpB contains a KS, KR, DH, 3 ACPs, and a thioesterase (TE) domain.<ref name="pmid12770824"/> It does not contain an enoyl reductase (ER) domain, which would be required for the complete reduction to the nine-carbon fatty acid. MupE is a single-domain protein that shows sequence similarity to known ER domains and may complete the reaction.<ref name="pmid12770824"/> It also remains possible that 9-hydroxy-nonanoic acid is derived partially or entirely from outside of the mupirocin cluster.

==Mupirocin versus fusidic acid==
Both 2 percent ointments are applied to patients 3 times daily for 7 days to cure primary and secondary skin infections. The mupirocin bacteriologic cure rate is 97 percent and the [[fusidic acid]] bacteriologic cure rate is 87 percent,<ref>{{cite journal |title=Topical 2% mupirocin versus 2% fusidic acid ointment in the treatment of primary and secondary skin infections |author=Gilbert M. |pmid=2502567 | volume=20 |journal=J Am Acad Dermatol |pages=1083–7 |doi=10.1016/s0190-9622(89)70137-7}}</ref> but mupirocin is more expensive than fusidic acid.
