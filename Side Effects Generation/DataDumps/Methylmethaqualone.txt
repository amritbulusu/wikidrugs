'''Methylmethaqualone''' ('''MMQ''') is a [[quinazolinone]] and an analogue of [[methaqualone]] that has similar [[sedative]] and [[hypnotic]] properties to its parent compound (resulting from its agonist activity at the β subtype of the [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor]]), and is around the same potency. Methylmethaqualone differs from methaqualone by 4-methylation on the phenyl ring. It was made illegal in Germany in 1999 and listed by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] as a "drug of forensic interest" at about the same time, but little other information is available.  It would appear that this compound was sold on the black market in Germany as a [[designer drug]] [[analog (chemistry)|analogue]] of methaqualone.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Klein RFX, Hays PA | title= Detection and Analysis of Drugs of Forensic Interest, 1992 - 2001; A Literature Review.| journal= Microgram Journal |date=January–June 2003; | volume=1 | issue=1–2 | page=60 | publisher=DEA | url=http://www.justice.gov/dea/programs/forensicsci/microgram/journal_v1/2003_1-2.pdf | format=pdf}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal

Animal studies of methylmethaqualone have shown it to produce [[convulsions]] at only slightly above the effective sedative dose,<ref>{{Cite journal
