'''Farampator''' (developmental code names '''CX-691''', '''ORG-24448''', '''SCH-900460''') is an [[ampakine]] drug. It was developed by [[Cortex Pharmaceuticals]], and licensed to [[Organon International|Organon BioSciences]] for commercial development. Following the purchase of Organon by [[Schering-Plough]] in 2007, the development license to farampator was transferred. The development of farampator was eventually terminated, reportedly due to concerns about [[cardiac toxicity]].<ref name="AdisInsight">http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800012259</ref><ref name="pmid22886028">{{cite journal | vauthors = Froestl W, Muhs A, Pfeifer A | title = Cognitive enhancers (nootropics).

Farampator has been investigated for its effect on [[AMPA receptor]]s and researched for potential use in the treatment of schizophrenia and [[Alzheimer's Disease]]. It was found to improve short-term memory, but impaired episodic memory. It produced side effects such as headache, somnolence and nausea. Subjects reporting side effects had significantly higher plasma levels of farampator than subjects without.{{cn|date=August 2017}} Additional analyses revealed that in the farampator condition the group without side effects showed a significantly superior memory performance relative to the group with side effects.  <ref>Wezenberg E, Verkes RJ, Ruigt GS, Hulstijn W, Sabbe BG.
