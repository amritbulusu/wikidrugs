'''Buparvaquone''' is a hydroxynaphthoquinone [[antiprotozoal]] drug related to [[parvaquone]] and [[atovaquone]]. It is a promising compound for the therapy and prophylaxis of all forms of [[theileriosis (disambiguation)|theileriosis]]<!--intentional link to DAB page-->. Buparvaquone has been shown to have anti-[[leishmania]]l activity ''in vitro''. It can be used to treat bovine [[East Coast fever]] protozoa ''in vitro'', along with the only other substance known - ''[[Peganum harmala]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} It is the only really effective commercial therapeutic product against bovine [[Tropical theileriosis|theileriosis]], where it has been used since the late 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

== Industrial production ==
It was first produced in [[Great Britain]], then in [[Germany]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Its patent expired in the mid-2000s, and was then produced in different countries, e.g. [[India]] and [http://www.razak-labs.com RAZAK labs co.] of [[Iran]]

== Use in bovine theileriosis ==
Using a single dose of 2,5&nbsp;mg/kg, the recovery rate of curable cases is 90 to 98%.  In [[tropical theileriosis]], a dosage of 2.0&nbsp;mg/kg has the same efficacy. Body temperature returns to normal in two to five days.
Parasitemia lowers from 12% on day 0 to 5% the next day, then to 1% by day 5 and none at day 7.<ref>Abou-El-Naga ''et al.'', Beni-Suef Vet. Med. J. 2005.</ref>
