[[File:Etopen 200mg by Towa Pharmaceutical.jpg|right|thumb|Generic etodolac]]
'''Etodolac''' is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ([[NSAID]]) approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] in January 1991.<ref name="medicinenet.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/etodolac/article.htm|title=etodolac, Lodine (Discontinued): Drug Facts, Side Effects and Dosing|author=Omudhome Ogbru, PharmD|work=MedicineNet}}</ref>

As of 2015 the cost for a typical month of medication in the United States is less than 25 USD.<ref name=Ric2015>{{cite book|last1=Hamilton|first1=Richart|title=Tarascon Pocket Pharmacopoeia 2015 Deluxe Lab-Coat Edition|date=2015|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning|isbn=9781284057560|page=7}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
{{See also|NSAIDs}}
NSAIDs are used for the management of mild to moderate pain, fever, and [[inflammation]]. They work by reducing the levels of [[prostaglandin]]s, which are chemicals that are responsible for pain and the fever and tenderness that occur with inflammation. Etodolac blocks the [[cyclooxygenase]] (abbrev. COX) enzymes which form [[prostanoid]]s, resulting in lower concentrations of [[prostaglandin]]s. As a consequence, inflammation, pain and fever are reduced.

Post-marketing studies demonstrated that etodolac inhibition of cyclooxygenase is somewhat [[COX-2]] selective <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Warner|first1=TD|last2=Giuliano|first2=F|last3=Vojnovic|first3=I|last4=Bukasa|first4=A|last5=Mitchell|first5=JA|last6=Vane|first6=JR|title=Nonsteroid drug selectivities for cyclo-oxygenase-1 rather than cyclo-oxygenase-2 are associated with human gastrointestinal toxicity: a full in vitro analysis.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=22 June 1999|volume=96|issue=13|pages=7563-8|pmid=10377455|pmc=22126}}</ref> similar to [[celecoxib]] and other "[[COX-2 inhibitor]]s." Unlike [[rofecoxib]], both etodolac and celecoxib can fully inhibit [[COX-1]] and are designated as having "preferential selectivity" toward COX-2. The R-[[enantiomer]] of etodolac is inactive against COX enzymes, but inhibits [[beta-catenin]] levels in [[hepatoma]] cells.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=17275129|year=2007|last1=Behari|first1=J|last2=Zeng|first2=G|last3=Otruba|first3=W|last4=Thompson|first4=MD|last5=Muller|first5=P|last6=Micsenyi|first6=A|last7=Sekhon|first7=SS|last8=Leoni|first8=L|last9=Monga|first9=SP|title=R-Etodolac Decreases Beta-Catenin Levels Along with Survival and Proliferation of Hepatoma Cells|volume=46|issue=5|pages=849–57|doi=10.1016/j.jhep.2006.11.017|pmc=1924913|journal=Journal of hepatology}}</ref>

==Indications==

Etodolac is licensed for the [[Therapy|treatment]] of inflammation and pain caused by [[osteoarthritis]] and [[rheumatoid arthritis]].<ref>[http://www.bnf.org/bnf/bnf/current/5216.htm BNF 55 - Etodolac]</ref>

==Interactions==
Etodolac should be avoided by patients with a history of [[asthma]] attacks, [[Urticaria|hives]], or other [[Allergy|allergic reactions]] to [[aspirin]] or other NSAIDs.  Rare but severe allergic reactions have been reported in such individuals.  It also should be avoided by patients with [[peptic ulcer]] disease or poor [[Renal physiology|kidney function]], since this medication can worsen both conditions.  Etodolac is used with caution in patients taking blood thinning medications ([[anticoagulant]]s), such as [[warfarin]] (Coumadin), because it increases the risk of [[bleeding]].  Patients taking both [[Lithium (medication)|lithium]] and etodolac may develop toxic blood lithium levels. Additionally, etodolac has been found to interact with certain anti-depressant medications, such as [[sertraline]] or [[fluoxetine]], which can increase risks of stroke, heart attack, and other cardiovascular conditions. Patients also taking [[ciclosporin]] (Sandimmune) can develop kidney toxicity.  Use in children has not been adequately studied.  Etodolac is not habit-forming.  NSAIDs should be discontinued prior to [[elective surgery]] because of a mild interference with [[clotting]] that is characteristic of this group of medicines.  Etodolac is best discontinued at least four days in advance of surgery.

==Pregnancy and nursing==
Etodolac is generally avoided during [[pregnancy]] and [[Breast feeding|nursing]]. NSAIDs may cause adverse cardiovascular effects in the [[fetus]] during pregnancy.
