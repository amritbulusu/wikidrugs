'''Sertraline''' (trade names '''Zoloft''' and others) is an [[antidepressant]] of the [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SSRI) class. It was introduced to the market by [[Pfizer]] in 1991. Sertraline is primarily prescribed for [[major depressive disorder]] in adult [[outpatients]] as well as [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]], [[panic disorder]], and [[social anxiety disorder]], in both adults and children. In 2013, it was the most prescribed antidepressant and second most prescribed psychiatric medication (after [[alprazolam]]) in the U.S., with over 41 million prescriptions.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://psychcentral.com/lib/top-25-psychiatric-medication-prescriptions-for-2013/00019543|title = Top 25 Psychiatric Medication Prescriptions for 2013|accessdate = 3 April 2015|author = John M. Grohol|year = 2014|publisher = Psych Central}}</ref>

Differences with other newer antidepressants are subtle and mostly confined to side effects. It is similar in tolerability profile to other SSRIs, with the types of adverse events usually including [[diarrhea]], [[nausea]], and [[sexual dysfunction]]. The incidence of diarrhea was higher with sertraline&mdash;especially when prescribed at higher doses&mdash;in comparison to other SSRIs.<ref name="pmc4047306">{{cite journal|title = A comparative review of escitalopram, paroxetine, and sertraline: are they all alike?|journal = International Clinical Psychopharmacology|volume = 29|issue = 4|pages = 185–196|pmc = 4047306|doi = 10.1097/YIC.0000000000000023|pmid = 24424469|year = 2014|author1 = Sanchez|first1 = C|last2 = Reines|first2 = E.

==Medical uses==
Sertraline is used for a number of conditions, including [[major depressive disorder]] (MDD), [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD), [[body dysmorphic disorder]] (BDD), [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), [[premenstrual dysphoric disorder]] (PMDD), [[panic disorder]], and [[social anxiety disorder]] (SAD).<ref name=AHFS>{{cite web|title=Sertraline hydrochloride|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/sertraline-hydrochloride.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref> It has also been used for [[premature ejaculation]] and [[vascular headaches]] but evidence of the effectiveness in treating those conditions is not robust.<ref name=AHFS />

====Elderly====
Sertraline used for the treatment of depression in elderly (older than 60) patients was superior to [[placebo]] and comparable to another SSRI [[fluoxetine]], and TCAs [[amitriptyline]], [[nortriptyline]] (Pamelor) and [[imipramine]]. Sertraline had much lower rates of adverse effects than these TCAs, with the exception of nausea, which occurred more frequently with sertraline.

===Sexual===
Like other SSRIs, sertraline is associated with sexual side effects, including [[sexual arousal disorder]] and difficulty achieving [[orgasm]]. The observed frequency of sexual side effects depends greatly on whether they are reported by patients spontaneously, as in the manufacturer's trials, or actively solicited by the physicians. There have been several [[blind experiment|double-blind studies]] of sexual side effects comparing sertraline with placebo or other antidepressants.<ref name="pmid11229450">{{cite journal | author = Ferguson JM | title = The effects of antidepressants on sexual functioning in depressed patients: a review | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = Suppl 3 | pages = 22–34 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11229450 | series = 62 }}</ref> While [[nefazodone]] (Serzone), [[bupropion]] (Wellbutrin) and [[reboxetine]] (Edronax) did not have negative effects on sexual functioning, 67% of men on sertraline experienced ejaculation difficulties vs. 18% before the treatment<ref name="pmid11229450" /> (or 61% vs. 0% according to another paper).<ref name="pmid9448656" /> Similarly, in a group of women who initially did not have difficulties achieving orgasm, 41% acquired this problem during treatment with sertraline.<ref name="pmid9448656" /> A 40% rate of [[anorgasmia|orgasm dysfunction]] (vs. 9% for placebo) on sertraline was observed in a mixed group in another study.<ref name="pmid10363731">{{cite journal | vauthors = Croft H, Settle E, Houser T, Batey SR, Donahue RM, Ascher JA | title = A placebo-controlled comparison of the antidepressant efficacy and effects on sexual functioning of sustained-release bupropion and sertraline | journal = Clinical Therapeutics | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 643–58 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10363731 | doi = 10.1016/S0149-2918(00)88317-4 }}</ref> [[Sexual arousal]] disorder, defined as "inadequate lubrication and swelling for women and erectile difficulties for men", occurred in 12% of patients on sertraline as compared with 1% of patients on placebo.

However, under the action of placebo the desire and satisfaction slightly improved.<ref name="pmid10363731" />

===Suicide===
The FDA requires all antidepressants, including sertraline, to carry a [[boxed warning]] stating that antidepressants may increase the risk of suicide in persons younger than 25 years. This warning is based on statistical analyses conducted by two independent groups of FDA experts that found a twofold increase of suicidal ideation and behavior in children and adolescents, and a 1.5-fold increase of suicidal behavior in the 18–24 age group.<ref name=FDA>{{cite web|vauthors=Levenson M, Holland C | title =Antidepressants and Suicidality in Adults: Statistical Evaluation.

[[Suicidal ideation]] and behavior in clinical trials are rare. For the above analysis, the FDA combined the results of 295&nbsp;trials of 11&nbsp;antidepressants for psychiatric indications in order to obtain [[statistically significant]] results. Considered separately, sertraline use in adults decreased the odds of suicidal behavior with a marginal statistical significance by 37%<ref name =FDA3 /> or 50%<ref name =FDA2 /> depending on the statistical technique used. The authors of the FDA analysis note that "given the large number of comparisons made in this review, chance is a very plausible explanation for this difference".<ref name =FDA2 /> The more complete data submitted later by the sertraline manufacturer Pfizer indicated increased suicidal behavior.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/06n0414/06N-0414-EC32-Attach-1.pdf |title=Memorandum from Pfizer Global Pharmaceuticals Re: DOCKET: 2006N-0414&nbsp;–"Suicidality data from adult antidepressant trials" Background package for December 13 Advisory Committee|accessdate=11 July 2008 |author=Pfizer Inc. |date= 30 November 2006|format=PDF |work=FDA DOCKET 2006N-0414 |publisher=FDA}}</ref> Similarly, the analysis conducted by the UK [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency|MHRA]] found a 50% increase of odds of suicide-related events, not reaching statistical significance, in the patients on sertraline as compared to the ones on placebo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/pl-p/documents/drugsafetymessage/con019472.pdf |title=Report of the CSM expert working group on the safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants|accessdate=11 July 2008 |date=December 2004 |format=PDF |publisher=MHRA}}</ref><ref name="pmid15718537">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gunnell D, Saperia J, Ashby D | title = Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and suicide in adults: meta-analysis of drug company data from placebo controlled, randomised controlled trials submitted to the MHRA's safety review | journal = BMJ | volume = 330 | issue = 7488 | page = 385 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15718537 | pmc = 549105 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.330.7488.385 }}</ref>

===Discontinuation syndrome===
{{Main article|Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome}}

Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is a condition that can occur following the interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of antidepressant drugs, including sertraline. The symptoms can include flu-like symptoms and disturbances in sleep, senses, movement, mood, and thinking. In most cases symptoms are mild, short-lived, and resolve without treatment. More severe cases are often successfully treated by temporary reintroduction of the drug with a slower tapering off rate.<ref name ="WarnerAFP">{{cite journal |vauthors=Warner CH, Bobo W, Warner C, Reid S, Rachal J |title=Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=74 |issue=3 |pages=449–56 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16913164 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

==Overdose==
Acute overdosage is often manifested by emesis, lethargy, ataxia, tachycardia and seizures.

Sertraline had a slight inhibitory effect on the metabolism of [[diazepam]], [[tolbutamide]] and [[warfarin]], which are [[CYP2C9]] or [[CYP2C19]] substrates; this effect was not considered to be clinically relevant.<ref name="pmid12452737" /> As expected from ''in vitro'' data, sertraline did not alter the human metabolism of the CYP3A4 substrates [[erythromycin]], [[alprazolam]], [[carbamazepine]], [[clonazepam]], and [[terfenadine]]; neither did it affect metabolism of the [[CYP1A2]] substrate [[clozapine]].

Sertraline had no effect on the actions of [[digoxin]] and [[atenolol]], which are not metabolized in the liver.<ref name=FDALabel/><ref name="pmid16192315" /><ref name="pmid12452737" /><ref name="pmid14709940">{{cite journal | vauthors = DeVane CL, Donovan JL, Liston HL, Markowitz JS, Cheng KT, Risch SC, Willard L | title = Comparative CYP3A4 inhibitory effects of venlafaxine, fluoxetine, sertraline, and nefazodone in healthy volunteers | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–10 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14709940 | doi = 10.1097/01.jcp.0000104908.75206.26 }}</ref> [[Case report]]s suggest that taking sertraline with [[phenytoin]] or [[zolpidem]] may induce sertraline metabolism and decrease its efficacy,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Allard S, Sainati SM, Roth-Schechter BF | title = Coadministration of short-term zolpidem with sertraline in healthy women | journal = Journal of clinical pharmacology | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 184–91 | year = 1999 | pmid = 11563412 | doi = 10.1177/00912709922007624 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Haselberger MB, Freedman LS, Tolbert S | title = Elevated serum phenytoin concentrations associated with coadministration of sertraline | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 107–9 | year = 1997 | pmid = 10950473 | doi = 10.1097/00004714-199704000-00008 }}</ref> and that taking sertraline with [[lamotrigine]] may increase the blood level of lamotrigine, possibly by inhibition of glucuronidation.<ref name="pmid9627209">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaufman KR, Gerner R | title = Lamotrigine toxicity secondary to sertraline | journal = Seizure | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 163–5 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9627209 | doi = 10.1016/S1059-1311(98)80074-5 }}</ref>

Clinical reports indicate that interaction between sertraline and the [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAOIs]] [[isocarboxazid]] and [[tranylcypromine]] may cause [[serotonin syndrome]]. In a placebo-controlled study in which sertraline was co-administered with [[lithium pharmacology|lithium]], 35% of the subjects experienced tremors, while none of those taking placebo did.<ref name="pmid12452737" />

According to the label, sertraline is [[contraindicated]] in individuals taking [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s or the [[antipsychotic]] [[pimozide]] (Orap). Sertraline concentrate contains alcohol, and is therefore contraindicated with [[disulfiram]] (Antabuse). The prescribing information recommends that treatment of the elderly and patients with liver impairment "must be approached with caution." Due to the slower elimination of sertraline in these groups, their exposure to sertraline may be as high as three times the average exposure for the same dose.<ref name=FDALabel/>

Single doses of 50 to 200&nbsp;mg sertraline have been found to result in [[Cmax (pharmacology)|peak plasma concentrations]] of 20 to 55&nbsp;ng/mL (65–180&nbsp;nM),<ref name="pmid11420570"/> while chronic treatment with 200&nbsp;mg/day sertraline, the maximum recommended dosage, has been found to result in maximal plasma levels of 118 to 166&nbsp;ng/mL (385–542&nbsp;nM).<ref name="pmid12452737">{{cite journal | vauthors = DeVane CL, Liston HL, Markowitz JS | title = Clinical pharmacokinetics of sertraline | journal = Clin Pharmacokinet | volume = 41 | issue = 15 | pages = 1247–66 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12452737 | doi = | url = }}</ref> However, sertraline is highly [[plasma protein binding|protein-bound in plasma]], with a bound fraction of 98.5%.<ref name="pmid12452737" /> Hence, only 1.5% is free and theoretically [[biological activity|bioactive]].<ref name="pmid12452737" /> Based on this percentage, free concentrations of sertraline would be 2.49&nbsp;ng/mL (8.13&nbsp;nM) at the very most, which is only about one-third of the K<sub>i</sub> value that Tatsumi et al. found with sertraline at the DAT.<ref name="pmid9537821" /> A very high dosage of sertraline of 400&nbsp;mg/day has been found to produce peak plasma concentrations of about 250&nbsp;ng/mL (816&nbsp;nM).<ref name="pmid12452737" /> This can be estimated to result in a free concentration of 3.75&nbsp;ng/mL (12.2&nbsp;nM), which is still only about half of the K<sub>i</sub> of sertraline for the DAT.<ref name="pmid9537821" />

As such, it seems unlikely that sertraline would produce much inhibition of dopamine reuptake even at clinically used dosages well in excess of the recommended maximum clinical dosage.<ref name="LemkeWilliams2008" /> This is in accordance with its 86-fold selectivity for the SERT over the DAT according to Tatsumi et al. and hence the fact that nearly 100-fold higher levels of sertraline would be necessary to also inhibit dopamine reuptake.<ref name="LemkeWilliams2008" /> In accordance, while sertraline has very low [[abuse potential]] and may even be aversive at clinical dosages,<ref name="pmid14870946">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nutt DJ | title = Death and dependence: current controversies over the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors | journal = J.

====Sigma receptor antagonism====
Sertraline has relatively high (nanomolar) affinity for the sigma σ<sub>1</sub> receptor.<ref name="AlbayrakHashimoto2017" /><ref name="pmid20373470" /> Conversely, it has low ([[micromolar]]) and insignificant affinity for the σ<sub>2</sub> receptor.<ref name="AlbayrakHashimoto2017" /><ref name="pmid20373470" /> It acts as an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of the σ<sub>1</sub> receptor, and is able to reverse σ<sub>1</sub> receptor-dependent actions of [[fluvoxamine]], a potent [[agonist]] of the receptor, ''[[in vitro]]''.<ref name="pmid20373470" /> However, the affinity of sertraline for the σ<sub>1</sub> receptor is more than 100-fold lower than for the SERT.<ref name="AlbayrakHashimoto2017" /><ref name="pmid20373470" /> Although there could be a role for the σ<sub>1</sub> receptor in the [[pharmacology]] of sertraline, the significance of this receptor in its actions is unclear and perhaps questionable.<ref name="pmid11420570" />

Sertraline is associated with a significantly higher incidence of diarrhea than other SSRIs, especially at higher doses.<ref name="pmc4047306" /> Agonists of the σ<sub>1</sub> receptor such as [[igmesine]] have been found to inhibit [[Gastrointestinal physiology#Secretion|intestinal secretion]] and [[bacteria]]-induced secretory diarrhea in animal studies,<ref name="SorberaSilvestre1999">{{cite journal|last1=Sorbera|first1=L.A.|last2=Silvestre|first2=J.|last3=Castañer|first3=J.|title=Igmesine Hydrochloride|journal=Drugs of the Future|volume=24|issue=2|year=1999|pages=133|issn=0377-8282|doi=10.1358/dof.1999.024.02.474038}}</ref> and igmesine showed preliminary evidence of efficacy for the treatment of diarrhea in a small [[clinical trial]].<ref name="pmid15547788">{{cite journal | vauthors = Volz HP, Stoll KD | title = Clinical trials with sigma ligands | journal = Pharmacopsychiatry | volume = 37 Suppl 3 | issue = | pages = S214–20 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15547788 | doi = 10.1055/s-2004-832680 | url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid20951914">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kent AJ, Banks MR | title = Pharmacological management of diarrhea | journal = Gastroenterol.

====Neurogenesis enhancement====
Sertraline has been found to directly act on the [[enzyme]] [[3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]] (3α-HSD) and modulate its activity, thereby enhancing the conversion of [[5α-dihydroprogesterone]] into the [[neurosteroid]] [[allopregnanolone]] and thus increasing the [[biosynthesis|production]] of allopregnanolone in the [[brain]].<ref name="pmid10557352">{{cite journal | vauthors = Griffin LD, Mellon SH | title = Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors directly alter activity of neurosteroidogenic enzymes | journal = Proc.

===Pharmacokinetics===
[[File:Desmethylsertraline skeletal.svg|thumb|250|right|Norsertraline (desmethylsertraline)—sertraline's chief active metabolite]]

Sertraline is absorbed slowly when taken orally, achieving its maximal concentration in the plasma 4–6&nbsp;hours after ingestion. In the blood, it is 98.5% [[plasma protein binding|bound to plasma proteins]]. Its half-life in the body is 13–45&nbsp;hours and, on average, is about 1.5 times (50%) longer in women (32&nbsp;hours) than in men (22&nbsp;hours), allowing a 1.5-times-higher exposure in women.<ref name="pmid12452737" /> According to ''[[in vitro]]'' studies, sertraline is metabolized by multiple [[cytochrome 450]] [[isoenzyme|isoforms]]: [[CYP2D6]], [[CYP2C9]], [[CYP2B6]], [[CYP2C19]] and [[CYP3A4]].

==History==
[[File:Development of Sertraline.svg|thumb|150px|right|upright|[[Skeletal formula]]e of chlorprothixene and tametraline, from which sertraline was derived]]

The history of sertraline dates back to the early 1970s, when [[Pfizer]] chemist Reinhard Sarges invented a novel series of psychoactive compounds based on the structure of the neuroleptic [[chlorprothixene]].<ref name=Welch /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sarges R, Tretter JR, Tenen SS, Weissman A | title = 5,8-Disubstituted 1-Aminotetralins. A Class of Compounds with a Novel Profile of Central Nervous System Activity | journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 16 | issue = 9 | pages = 1003–1011 | year = 1973 | pmid = 4795663 | doi = 10.1021/jm00267a010 }}</ref> Further work on these compounds led to [[lometraline]] and then to [[tametraline]], a [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor|norepinephrine]] and weaker [[dopamine reuptake inhibitor]]. Development of tametraline was soon stopped because of undesired [[stimulant]] effects observed in animals. A few years later, in 1977, pharmacologist [[Kenneth Koe]], after comparing the structural features of a variety of reuptake inhibitors, became interested in the tametraline series. He asked another Pfizer chemist, Willard Welch, to synthesize some previously unexplored tametraline derivatives. Welch generated a number of potent norepinephrine and [[serotonin-noradrenaline-dopamine reuptake inhibitor|triple reuptake]] inhibitors, but to the surprise of the scientists, one representative of the generally inactive [[cis-trans isomerism|cis-analogs]] was a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Welch then prepared [[stereoisomerism|stereoisomers]] of this compound, which were tested ''[[in vivo]]'' by animal [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral scientist]] Albert Weissman. The most potent and selective (+)-isomer was taken into further development and eventually named sertraline. Weissman and Koe recalled that the group did not set up to produce an antidepressant of the SSRI type—in that sense their inquiry was not "very goal driven", and the discovery of the sertraline molecule was [[serendipity#Pharmacology|serendipitous]]. According to Welch, they worked outside the mainstream at Pfizer, and even "did not have a formal project team". The group had to overcome initial bureaucratic reluctance to pursue sertraline development, as Pfizer was considering licensing an antidepressant candidate from another company.<ref name=Welch>The most complete account of sertraline discovery, targeted at chemists, see: {{cite journal |author=Welch WM |title=Discovery and Development of Sertraline |journal=Advances in Medicinal Chemistry |volume=3 |pages=113–148 |year=1995 |doi=10.1016/S1067-5698(06)80005-2 |series=Advances in Medicinal Chemistry |isbn=978-1-55938-798-9}}</ref><ref>See also: {{cite journal |doi=10.1021/cen-v084n010.p045 |author=Mullin R |title=ACS Award for Team Innovation |journal=Chemical & Engineering News |volume=84 |issue=5 |pages=45–52 |year=2006}}</ref><ref>A short blurb on the history of sertraline, see: {{cite journal | author = Couzin J | title = The brains behind blockbusters | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 309 | issue = 5735 | page = 728 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16051786 | doi = 10.1126/science.309.5735.728 }}</ref>

Sertraline was approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1991 based on the recommendation of the Psychopharmacological Drugs Advisory Committee; it had already become available in the [[United Kingdom]] the previous year.<ref name=He168>{{cite book |title=The Antidepressant Era |last=Healy |first=David |authorlink=David Healy (psychiatrist)|year=1999 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=0-674-03958-0 |page=168}}</ref> The FDA committee achieved a consensus that sertraline was safe and effective for the treatment of MDD.
