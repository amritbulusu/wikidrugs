'''Propiram''' ('''Algeril''', '''Dirame''', '''Bay 4503''') is a partial mu [[opioid]] receptor agonist and weak mu antagonist [[analgesic]] from the ampromide family of drugs. It was invented in 1963 in the United Kingdom by Bayer<ref>{{US Patent|3163654}}</ref> but was not widely marketed, although it saw some limited clinical use, especially in dentistry.  Propiram reached [[Phase III clinical trial]]s in the United States and Canada.<ref>{{cite book | title = Drug Facts & Comparisons | edition = 56th | date = 2002}}</ref> 

==Pharmacology==
Propiram exhibits weak opioid antagonist activity on the mu receptor—quite a bit weaker than its agonist effects—and the effect on kappa and delta opioid, sigma receptors, or the [[NMDA]] system are not well understood. Other drugs of the partial mu-opioid agonist/antagonist type include [[meptazinol]], [[buprenorphine]], [[butorphanol]], [[phenazocine]], [[nalbuphine]], [[pentazocine]], [[dezocine]] and its relatives.

With about 10% of the analgesic potency of [[morphine]], 50&nbsp;mg of propiram is equivalent to about 60&nbsp;mg of codeine or 50&nbsp;mg of pentazocine. In many patients, propiram is an effective analgesic comparable to other drugs such as these as well as [[pethidine]], with a normal dose of around 50–100&nbsp;mg and a duration of action of 3 to 6 hours.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 7165237| year = 1982| author1 = Wilson| first1 = R.

==Regulation==
Propiram is currently a Schedule I/Narcotic controlled substance in the United States with an ACSCN of 9649 and a zero annual aggregate manufacturing quota as of 2014.  It has been almost exclusively [[Pharmaceutical formulation|formulated]] as the [[fumarate]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]].
