'''Phenazopyridine''' is a chemical which, when excreted into the [[urine]], has a local [[analgesic]] effect. It is often used to alleviate the [[pain]], [[irritation]], discomfort, or [[Urinary urgency|urgency]] caused by [[urinary tract infections]], [[surgery]], or injury to the [[urinary tract]]. Phenazopyridine was discovered by [[Bernhard Joos]], the founder of [[Cilag]].

==Medical uses==
Phenazopyridine is prescribed for its local analgesic effects on the urinary tract. It is sometimes used in conjunction with an antibiotic or other anti-infective medication at the beginning of treatment to help provide immediate symptomatic relief. Phenazopyridine does not treat infections or injury; it is only used for symptom relief.<ref name="wcrx.com">http://www.wcrx.com/pdfs/pi/pi_pyridium_plus.pdf{{full citation needed|date=July 2015}}</ref><ref name=dailymed>http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=ae0f0808-51ed-43b9-86a3-b947c42da89f{{full citation needed|date=July 2015}}</ref> It is recommended that it be used for no longer than the first two days of antibacterial treatment as longer treatment may mask symptoms.<ref name=dailymed />

Phenazopyridine is also prescribed for other cases requiring relief from irritation or discomfort during urination. For example, it is often prescribed after the use of an in-dwelling [[Foley catheter]], endoscopic ([[cystoscopy]]) procedures, or after urethral, prostate, or urinary bladder surgery which may result in irritation of the [[epithelial]] lining of the urinary tract.<ref name="wcrx.com"/>{{Dead link|date=December 2014}}

The [[American Urological Association]] has recommended the use of phenazopyridine as a first stage treatment for [[interstitial cystitis]].<ref>https://www.auanet.org/education/guidelines/ic-bladder-pain-syndrome.cfm{{full citation needed|date=July 2015}}</ref>

This medication is not used to treat infection and may mask symptoms of inappropriately treated UTI. It provides symptom relief during a UTI, following surgery, or injury to the urinary tract. UTI therapy should be limited to 1-2 days.<ref name=dailymed /> Long-term use of phenazopyridine can mask symptoms.<ref name="Primary Care UTI">{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Alina |first2=Parminder |last2=Nizran |first3=Michael |last3=Malone |first4=Timothy |last4=Riley |title=Urinary Tract Infections|journal=Primary Care - Clinics in Office Practice|date=September 2013|volume=40|issue=3|page=693|doi=10.1016/j.pop.2013.06.005<!--|accessdate=2014-04-19-->}}</ref>

==Side effects==
[[File:Pyridiumurine.jpg|thumb|The characteristic orange-colored urine after taking Pyridium]]
Phenazopyridine produces a vivid color change in urine, typically to a dark orange to reddish color. This effect is common and harmless, and indeed a key indicator of the presence of the medication in the body. Users of phenazopyridine are warned not to wear contact lenses, as phenazopyridine has been known to permanently discolor contact lenses and fabrics.<ref name=wcrx.com /><ref name="medline">https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682231.html{{full citation needed|date=July 2015}}</ref> Some may be mistakenly concerned that this indicated blood in the urine.

Phenazopyridine can also cause [[headache]]s, [[upset stomach]] (especially when not taken with food), or [[dizziness]]. Less frequently it can cause a pigment change in the skin or eyes, to a noticeable yellowish color. This is due to a depressed excretion via the kidneys causing a buildup of the medication in the skin, and normally indicates a need to discontinue usage.<ref name=dailymed /> Other such side effects include [[fever]], [[confusion]], [[shortness of breath]], [[skin]] [[rash]], and [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] of the face, fingers, feet, or legs.<ref name=wcrx.com /><ref name=dailymed /> Long-term use may cause yellowing of nails.<ref>{{Cite journal | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine |date=15 December 1997 | volume = 127 | page = 1137 | type = letter | title = Lemon-yellow nails and long-term phenazopyridine use | last1 = Amit | first1 = G | last2 = Halkin | first2 = A | pmid = 9412335 | issue = 12 | doi=10.7326/0003-4819-127-12-199712150-00040}}</ref>

===Pregnancy===
This medication is [[Pregnancy Category|pregnancy category]] B. This means that the medication has shown no adverse events in animal models, but no human trials have been conducted.<ref name=dailymed /> It is not known if phenazopyridine is excreted in breast milk.<ref name=dailymed />

==Pharmacokinetics==
The full [[pharmacokinetic]] properties of phenazopyridine have not been determined. It has mostly been studied in [[animal model]]s, but they may not be very representative of humans.<ref name = jps /> Rat models have shown its half-life to be 7.35 hours,<ref name = bdd /> and 40% is metabolized hepatically (by the liver).<ref name = bdd>{{cite journal| doi = 10.1002/bdd.2510140208| journal = Biopharm Drug Dispos| date=March 1993| volume = 14| pages = 171–9| title = Metabolism of phenazopyridine by isolated rat hepatocytes|vauthors=Jurima-Romet M, Thomas BH, Solomonraj G, Paul CJ, Huang H | pmid = 8453026| issue = 2}}</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Phenazopyridine's [[mechanism of action]] is not well known, and only basic information on its interaction with the body is available. It is known that the chemical has a direct topical analgesic effect on the [[mucosa]] lining of the urinary tract. It is rapidly excreted by the kidneys directly into the urine.<ref name = jps>{{cite journal| doi = 10.1002/jps.2600790410| journal = Journal of Pharm Sci| date=April 1990| volume = 79| pages = 321–5| title = Excretion of phenazopyridine and its metabolites in the urine of humans, rats, mice, and guinea pigs|vauthors=Thomas BH, Whitehouse LW, Solomonraj G, Paul CJ | pmid = 2352143| issue = 4}}</ref> [[Hydroxylation]] is the major form of metabolism in humans,<ref name = jps /> and the [[Azo compound|azo]] bond is usually not cleaved.<ref name = jps /> On the order of 65% of an oral dose will be excreted directly into the urine chemically unchanged.<ref name=dailymed />
