'''Methylhexanamine''' (trade names '''Forthane''', '''Geranamine''') or '''methylhexamine''', commonly known as '''1,3-dimethylamylamine''' ('''1,3-DMAA''') or simply '''dimethylamylamine''' ('''DMAA'''), is an indirect [[sympathomimetic drug]] invented and developed by [[Eli Lilly and Company]] and marketed as an inhaled [[nasal decongestant]] from 1944 until it was voluntarily withdrawn from the market in 1983.

Since 2006 methylhexanamine has been sold extensively under many names as a [[stimulant]] or energy-boosting [[dietary supplement]] under the claim that it is similar to certain compounds found in [[geranium]]s, but its safety has been questioned as a number of adverse events and at least five deaths have been associated with methylhexanamine-containing supplements.<ref name="nyt-fda" /> It is banned by many sports authorities and governmental agencies.

==History==
In April 1944, [[Eli Lilly and Company]] introduced methylhexanamine under the brand name '''Forthane''' as an inhaled [[nasal decongestant]]; Lilly voluntarily withdrew methylhexanamine from the market in 1983.<ref name=DODTox>Col John Lammie et al. [http://home.fhpr.osd.mil/Libraries/pdf/Report_of_the_DoD_DMAA_Safety_Review_Panel_2013.sflb.ashx Report of the Department Of Defense: 1,3 Dimethylamylamine (Dmaa) Safety Review Panel] June 3, 2013</ref>{{rp|12}} The compound is an [[aliphatic]] [[amine]]; the pharmaceutical industry had a strong interest in compounds in this class as nasal decongestants in the early 20th century, which led to methylhexanamine and four other similar compounds being brought to market for that use: [[tuaminoheptane]], [[isometheptene|octin]], [[oenethyl]], and [[propylhexedrine]]; octin and oenethyl were eventually approved for use in keeping blood pressure sufficiently high for patients under [[anesthesia]].<ref name=RegRev/>{{rp|95–96}}

==Marketing as dietary supplement==
[[Patrick Arnold]] reintroduced methylhexanamine in 2006 as a [[dietary supplement]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/07/AR2006050700913.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Amy | last=Shipley | title=Chemist's New Product Contains Hidden Substance | date=May 8, 2006}}</ref><ref>Carroll, Will.

Arnold introduced it under the trademarked name '''Geranamine''', a name held by his company, [[Proviant Technologies]]. A large number of supplements focusing on fat loss and workout energy ([[thermogenic]] or general-purpose [[stimulant]]s) used the ingredient in concert with other substances such as [[caffeine]], a combination similar to the combination of [[ECA stack|ephedrine and caffeine]].

Methylhexanamine-containing supplements sometimes list "geranium oil" or "geranium extract" as a source of methylhexanamine. However, geranium oils do not contain methylhexanamine, and the methylhexanamine in these supplements is added in the form of synthetic material.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lisi A, Hasick N, Kazlauskas R, Goebel C | year = 2011 | title = Studies of methylhexaneamine in supplements and geranium oil | journal = Drug Test Anal | volume = 3 | issue = 11-12 | pages = 873–6 | doi = 10.1002/dta.392 | pmid = 22147493}}</ref> Recent studies have shown that DMAA is found in some types of geraniums.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Heather L.

==Pharmacology==
Methylhexanamine is an indirect [[sympathomimetic drug]] that [[Vasoconstriction|constricts blood vessels]] and thus has effects on the heart, lungs, and reproductive organs. It also causes [[bronchodilation]], inhibits [[peristalsis]] in the intestines, and has [[diuretic]] effects.<ref name=RegRev>{{cite journal|last=Venhuis|first=Bastiaan J.|author2=De Kaste, Dries|title=Scientific opinion on the regulatory status of 1,3-Dimethylamylamine (DMAA)|journal=European Journal of Food Research & Review | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 93–100 | year = 2012|url=http://www.sciencedomain.org/abstract.php?iid=155&id=1&aid=703#.UuVae2Qo5GE}}</ref>{{rp|95}} Most studies have been done on pharmacological effects when the drug is inhaled; our understanding of what methylhexanamine does when taken orally are mostly based on extrapolating from the activities of similar compounds.<ref name=RegRev/>{{rp|97}} A 2013 review concluded that: "Pharmacological effects after oral intake can be expected on the lungs (bronchodilation) and the nasal mucosa following a single oral dose of about 4–15&nbsp;mg. Pharmacological effects on the heart can be expected following a single oral dose of about 50–75&nbsp;mg. Pharmacological effects on the blood pressure can be expected after a single oral dose of about 100&nbsp;mg. Because of the long half-life, there is a risk that repeated doses within 24–36 hours could lead to steadily stronger pharmacological effects (build-up)."<ref name=RegRev/>{{rp|98}}

=== Detection in body fluids===
Methylhexanamine may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine by gas or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma methylhexanamine concentrations are expected to be in a range of 10–100 μg/l in persons using the drug recreationally, >100 μg/l in intoxicated patients, and >300 μg/l in victims of acute overdosage.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.annemergmed.2012.04.008| title = Use of recreational drug 1,3 Dimethylamylamine (DMAA) associated with cerebral hemorrhage.| journal = Ann Emerg Med| year = 2012| last1 = Gee| first1 = P.| last2 = Tallon| first2 = C.| last3 = Long| first3 = N.| volume=60| pages=431–434}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author = Baselt RC  | title = Disposition of toxic drugs and chemicals in man, 10th edition | year = 2014 | publisher = Biomedical Publications | location = Seal Beach, Ca. | isbn = 978-0-9626523-9-4 | page = 1329 }}</ref>

A 2012 review by a panel convened by the U.S. Department of Defense to study whether the military should ban methylhexanamine supplements from stores on its bases concluded that: "The existing evidence does not conclusively establish that DMAA-containing substances are causally-associated with adverse medical events. However, a consistent theme among the studies is that DMAA use potentially affects cardiovascular function, just as other sympathomimetic stimulants. Without further rigorous study designs developed to evaluate the safety of DMAA, especially in patients with concomitant use of other substances, co-morbid conditions and high frequency use, the magnitude of the association of DMAA with adverse medical events is uncertain.  Widespread use of DMAA-containing products by tens of thousands of Service members – often in combination with other substances – increases the likelihood of observing serious adverse events, even if the overall risk of a DMAA-related event is low, resulting in consequential impact to some Service members and other beneficiaries. DMAA should be further studied to evaluate its safety. Data from the case control study suggest that the frequency and amount of DMAA use and risk of specific AMEs, particularly heat injuries and rhabdomyolysis, need to be examined in greater detail. ... The Safety Review Panel recommended ... to continue the prohibition of sales of DMAA-containing products in Exchanges and concessions. The Panel judged that the evidence supports sufficient risk, even if very low, of another death or catastrophic illness of a Service member who has used DMAA-containing products, without any offsetting benefit of these products."<ref name=DODTox />{{rp|10}}

A 2012 review of the regulatory status of DMAA found that "1,3-Dimethylamylamine (DMAA) is a pressor amine often found in food supplements for athletes at dosages of 25-65 mg. Historically, the compound has been used as a nasal decongestant but its oral application is largely unstudied leaving the regulatory status of such food supplements as unlicensed medicines undetermined. We therefore reviewed the literature on DMAA and similar amines in order to deduce an effective oral dosage. Based on our findings we conclude that oral preparations with >4 mg DMAA per dose unit should be considered as effective as a bronchodilator. Food supplements that exceed that limit are in fact subject to the Medicines Act and require licensing. Dosages higher than 100-200 mg are expected to cause serious adverse events."<ref name=RegRev />{{rp|93}}

The death of Claire Squires, a runner who collapsed near the finish-line of the April [[2012 London Marathon]], has been linked to methylhexanamine. The coroner stated that methylhexanamine was "probably an important factor" during the inquest. Despite, according to a friend, having been diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat<ref>{{citation|url="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/athletics/london-marathon/9237808/Claire-Squires-runner-who-died-during-London-Marathon-suffered-from-heart-condition.html"|title=Claire Squires: runner who died during London Marathon 'suffered from heart condition'}}</ref> - and advised not to consume methylhexanamine, it is believed that she consumed the substance through drinking an energy drink, which was subsequently adjusted to exclude methylhexanamine.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-21262717|title=Claire Squires inquest: DMAA was factor in marathon runner's death|publisher=BBC News|date=30 January 2013|accessdate=30 January 2013}}</ref>

==Regulation==
A number of sporting authorities and countries have banned or heavily restricted the use of methylhexanamine as a dietary supplement, due to serious concerns about its safety. These countries include the U.S., Canada, New Zealand, Sweden, Australia, Finland,  the United Kingdom, and Brazil.
