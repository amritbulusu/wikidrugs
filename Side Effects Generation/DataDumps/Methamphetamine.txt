Dextromethamphetamine is a much stronger CNS stimulant than levomethamphetamine.

Both methamphetamine and dextromethamphetamine are illicitly trafficked and sold owing to their potential for recreational use.  The highest prevalence of illegal methamphetamine use occurs in parts of Asia, Oceania, and in the United States, where racemic methamphetamine, levomethamphetamine, and dextromethamphetamine are classified as [[list of Schedule II drugs (US)|schedule II]] controlled substances.

=== Recreational ===
{{Hatnote|See also: [[Party and play]] and the [[History and culture of substituted amphetamines#Recreational routes of administration|Recreational routes of methamphetamine administration]]}}

==Contraindications==
Methamphetamine is [[contraindicated]] in individuals with a history of [[substance use disorder]], [[heart disease]], or severe [[Irritability|agitation]] or anxiety, or in individuals currently experiencing [[arteriosclerosis]], [[glaucoma]],  [[hyperthyroidism]], or severe [[hypertension]].<ref name="Desoxyn" /> The FDA states that individuals who have experienced [[hypersensitivity]] reactions to other stimulants in the past or are currently taking [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s should not take methamphetamine.<ref name="Desoxyn" />  The FDA also advises individuals with [[bipolar disorder]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], elevated [[blood pressure]], liver or kidney problems, [[mania]], [[psychosis]], [[Raynaud's phenomenon]], [[epileptic seizure|seizures]], [[thyroid]] problems, [[tic]]s, or [[Tourette syndrome]] to monitor their symptoms while taking methamphetamine.<ref name="Desoxyn" />  Due to the potential for stunted growth, the FDA advises monitoring the height and weight of growing children and adolescents during treatment.<ref name="Desoxyn" />

== Side effects ==

=== Physical ===

The physical effects of methamphetamine can include [[Anorexia (symptom)|loss of appetite]], hyperactivity, [[dilated pupils]], [[Flushing (physiology)|flushed skin]], [[diaphoresis|excessive sweating]], [[Psychomotor agitation|increased movement]], dry mouth and [[bruxism|teeth grinding]] (leading to "[[meth mouth]]"), headache,  [[arrhythmias|irregular heartbeat]] (usually as [[tachycardia|accelerated heartbeat]] or [[bradycardia|slowed heartbeat]]), [[tachypnea|rapid breathing]], [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[hypotension|low blood pressure]], [[hyperthermia|high body temperature]], diarrhea, constipation, [[blurred vision]], [[dizziness]], [[Fasciculation|twitching]], [[numbness]], [[tremor]]s, dry skin, [[acne]], and [[pallor|pale appearance]].

==== Meth mouth ====
{{Main|Meth mouth}}
[[File:Suspectedmethmouth09-19-05.jpg|150px|thumb|A suspected case of [[meth mouth]]]]
Methamphetamine users and addicts may lose their teeth abnormally quickly, regardless of the route of administration, from a condition informally known as [[meth mouth]].<ref name="pmid22782046" /> The condition is generally most severe in users who inject the drug, rather than swallow, smoke, or inhale it.<ref name="pmid22782046">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hussain F, Frare RW, Py Berrios KL |title=Drug abuse identification and pain management in dental patients: a case study and literature review |journal=Gen. Dent. |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=334–345 |year=2012 |pmid=22782046 |doi= |url=}}</ref>  According to the [[American Dental Association]], meth mouth "is probably caused by a combination of drug-induced psychological and physiological changes resulting in [[xerostomia]] (dry mouth), extended periods of poor [[oral hygiene]], frequent consumption of high-calorie, carbonated beverages and [[bruxism]] (teeth grinding and clenching)".<ref name="pmid22782046" /><ref name="ADA">{{cite web|url=http://www.ada.org/prof/resources/topics/methmouth.asp |title=Methamphetamine Use (Meth Mouth)|accessdate=15 December 2006 |publisher=American Dental Association |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080601035323/http://www.ada.org/prof/resources/topics/methmouth.asp |archivedate = June 2008}}</ref> As dry mouth is also a common side effect of other stimulants, which are not known to contribute severe tooth decay, many researchers suggest that methamphetamine associated tooth decay is more due to users' other choices. They suggest the side effect has been exaggerated and stylized to create a stereotype of current users to deter new ones.<ref name="pmid22089317">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hart CL, Marvin CB, Silver R, Smith EE |title=Is cognitive functioning impaired in methamphetamine users?

==== Sexually transmitted infection ====
Methamphetamine use was found to be related to higher frequencies of unprotected sexual intercourse in both [[HIV/AIDS|HIV-positive]] and unknown casual partners, an association more pronounced in HIV-positive participants.<ref name="STD"/> These findings suggest that methamphetamine use and engagement in unprotected anal intercourse are co-occurring risk behaviors, behaviors that potentially heighten the risk of HIV transmission among gay and bisexual men.<ref name="STD">{{cite journal|vauthors=Halkitis PN, Pandey Mukherjee P, Palamar JJ | title=Longitudinal Modeling of Methamphetamine Use and Sexual Risk Behaviors in Gay and Bisexual Men| journal=AIDS and Behavior| volume=13| issue=4| pages=783–791| year=2008| pmid=18661225|doi=10.1007/s10461-008-9432-y}}</ref> Methamphetamine use allows users of both sexes to engage in prolonged sexual activity, which may cause genital sores and abrasions as well as [[priapism]] in men.<ref name="Desoxyn" /><ref name="Patrick Moore">{{cite web|author=Patrick Moore|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2005-06-14/people/we-are-not-ok/|title=We Are Not OK|publisher=VillageVoice |date=June 2005 |accessdate=15 January 2011}}</ref> Methamphetamine may also cause sores and abrasions in the mouth via [[bruxism]], increasing the risk of sexually transmitted infection.<ref name="Desoxyn" /><ref name="Patrick Moore"/>

Studies with juvenile rats have also indicated that repeated exposure to methylphenidate does not necessarily lead to enhanced drug-seeking behavior in adulthood (38). However, the recent increase of methylphenidate use as a cognitive enhancer by the general public has again raised concerns because of its potential for abuse and addiction (3, 6–10). Thus, although oral administration of clinical doses of methylphenidate is not associated with euphoria or with abuse problems, nontherapeutic use of high doses or i.v. administration may lead to addiction (39, 40).-->}}</ref>

Genetic or pharmacological blockade of G9a in the NAc potentiates behavioral responses to cocaine and opiates, whereas increasing G9a function exerts the opposite effect (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a). Such drug-induced downregulation of G9a and H3K9me2 also sensitizes animals to the deleterious effects of subsequent chronic stress (Covington et al., 2011). Downregulation of G9a increases the dendritic arborization of NAc neurons, and is associated with increased expression of numerous proteins implicated in synaptic function, which directly connects altered G9a/H3K9me2 in the synaptic plasticity associated with addiction (Maze et al., 2010).<br />G9a appears to be a critical control point for epigenetic regulation in NAc, as we know it functions in two negative feedback loops. It opposes the induction of ΔFosB, a long-lasting transcription factor important for drug addiction (Robison and Nestler, 2011), while ΔFosB in turn suppresses G9a expression (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a).&nbsp;... Also, G9a is induced in NAc upon prolonged HDAC inhibition, which explains the paradoxical attenuation of cocaine’s behavioral effects seen under these conditions, as noted above (Kennedy et al., 2013). GABAA receptor subunit genes are among those that are controlled by this feedback loop. Thus, chronic cocaine, or prolonged HDAC inhibition, induces several GABAA receptor subunits in NAc, which is associated with increased frequency of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). In striking contrast, combined exposure to cocaine and HDAC inhibition, which triggers the induction of G9a and increased global levels of H3K9me2, leads to blockade of GABAA receptor and IPSC regulation. -->}}</ref> Sufficiently overexpressing ΔJunD in the nucleus accumbens with [[viral vector]]s can completely block many of the neural and behavioral alterations seen in chronic drug abuse (i.e., the alterations mediated by ΔFosB).<ref name="Nestler" /> ΔFosB also plays an important role in regulating behavioral responses to [[natural reward]]s, such as palatable food, sex, and exercise.<ref name="Nestler" /><ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /><ref name="ΔFosB reward">{{cite journal |vauthors=Blum K, Werner T, Carnes S, Carnes P, Bowirrat A, Giordano J, Oscar-Berman M, Gold M | title = Sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll: hypothesizing common mesolimbic activation as a function of reward gene polymorphisms | journal = J.

Additionally, σ receptor antagonists&nbsp;... prevent the development of behavioral sensitization to METH [17, 18].&nbsp;...<br /> σ Receptor agonists have been shown to facilitate dopamine release, through both σ-1 and σ-2 receptors [11–14].}}</ref><ref name="Meth Targets" /><ref name="SigmaB">{{cite journal |vauthors=Rodvelt KR, Miller DK | title = Could sigma receptor ligands be a treatment for methamphetamine addiction? | journal = Curr Drug Abuse Rev | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 156–162 |date=September 2010  | pmid = 21054260 | doi = 10.2174/1874473711003030156| url = }}</ref> Sigma receptor activation by methamphetamine appears facilitate its central nervous system stimulant effects and promote neurotoxicity within the brain.<ref name="Sigma" /><ref name="SigmaB" /> Methamphetamine is known to inhibit the CYP2D6 liver enzyme as well.<ref name="DrugBank Enzymes" /> Dextromethamphetamine is a stronger [[psychostimulant]] (approximately ten times on [[striatum|striatal]] dopamine), but [[levomethamphetamine]] has stronger [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] effects, a longer half-life, and longer perceived effects among addicts.<ref name="Melega">{{cite journal |vauthors=Melega WP, Cho AK, Schmitz D, Kuczenski R, Segal DS | title = l-methamphetamine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics for assessment of in vivo deprenyl-derived l-methamphetamine | journal = J.
