'''Regorafenib''' ('''BAY 73-4506''', commercial name '''Stivarga''') is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor developed by [[Bayer]] which targets angiogenic, stromal and oncogenic [[receptor tyrosine kinase]] (RTK). Regorafenib shows anti-[[Angiogenesis|angiogenic]] activity due to its dual targeted [[VEGF receptors|VEGFR2-TIE2]] tyrosine kinase inhibition. Since 2009 it was studied as a potential treatment option in multiple tumor types.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.news.bayer.com/baynews/baynews.nsf/id/291E08301C088221C1257634001EA3C7 |title=Bayer Announces New Data on Oncology Portfolio To Be Presented at the ECCO-ESMO Congress 2009 |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-09-19}}</ref> By 2015 it had 2 US approvals for advanced cancers.

==Approvals and indications==

===Metastatic colorectal cancer===
Regorafenib demonstrated to increase the overall survival of patients with metastatic [[colorectal cancer]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.press.bayer.com/baynews/baynews.nsf/id/Phase-III-Trial-Regorafenib-Metastatic-Colorectal-Cancer-Meets-Primary-Endpoint-Improving-Overall?Open&ccm=001|title=Phase III Trial of Regorafenib in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Meets Primary Endpoint of Improving Overall Survival|format= |work= |accessdate=2011-10-26}}</ref> and has been approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration|US FDA]] on September 27, 2012.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm321271.htm |title=FDA approves new treatment for advanced colorectal cancer |date=27 Sep 2012 }}</ref>

After a manufacturer's appeal Regorafenib was restored to the list of treatments funded by the English [[Cancer Drugs Fund]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Cancer fund reprieve for just one drug, Regorafenib|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-32835516|accessdate=7 June 2015|publisher=BBC|date=22 May 2015}}</ref>

===Advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumours===
On February 25, 2013 the US FDA expanded the approved use to treat patients with advanced [[gastrointestinal stromal tumor]]s that cannot be surgically removed and no longer respond to other FDA-approved treatments for this disease. In a clinical study with 199 patients regorafenib treated patients had a delay in tumor growth (progression-free survival) that was, on average, 3.9 months longer than patients who were given placebo.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm340958.htm |title=FDA approves Stivarga for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors |date=25 Feb 2013 }}</ref>

==Clinical trials==
MetastaticCRC: After the CORRECT trial, two phase 3 trials (CONSIGN, CONCUR) showed benefits compared to placebo. Regorafenib dosing was 150 or 160&nbsp;mg/d for first 3 weeks of each 4 week cycle.<ref name=CN2015>[http://www.cancernetwork.com/esmo-2015-world-gi/consign-concur-confirm-efficacy-regorafenib-mcrc CONSIGN, CONCUR Confirm Efficacy of Regorafenib in mCRC. 2015]</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Regorafenib is being approved with a Boxed Warning alerting patients and health care professionals that severe and fatal liver toxicity occurred in patients treated with regorafenib during clinical studies. Serious side effects, which occurred in less than one percent of patients, were liver damage, severe bleeding, blistering and peeling of skin, very high blood pressures requiring emergency treatment, heart attacks and perforations (holes) in the intestines. The most common side effects reported in patients treated with regorafenib include weakness or fatigue, loss of appetite, [[hand-foot syndrome]] (also called palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia), diarrhoea, mouth sores (mucousitis), weight loss, infection, high blood pressure, and changes in voice volume or quality ([[dysphonia]]).<ref>{{cite web | title=FDA Prescribing Information | url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/203085lbl.pdf |date=27 Sep 2012}}</ref>

==Other actions==
Regorafenib and at least one of its analogs, sorafenib, are potent inhibitors of [[Soluble epoxide hydrolase]] (sEH).<ref name="pmid24345640">{{cite journal | pmid = 24345640 | pmc = 3914417 | year = 2014 | author1 = Zhang | first1 = G | title = Stabilized epoxygenated fatty acids regulate inflammation, pain, angiogenesis and cancer | journal = Progress in Lipid Research | volume = 53 | pages = 108–23 | last2 = Kodani | first2 = S | last3 = Hammock | first3 = B.
