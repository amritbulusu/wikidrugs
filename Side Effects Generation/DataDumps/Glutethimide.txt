'''Glutethimide''' is a [[Sleep#Hypnotics|hypnotic]] [[sedative]] that was introduced by Ciba<ref>{{ cite patent | title = 3-Disubstituted Dioxopiperidines and the Manufacture thereof | country = US | number = 2673205 | status = patent | inventor = Hoffmann, K.; Tagmann, E. | assign1 = Ciba | gdate = 1954-03-23 }}</ref> in 1954 as a safe alternative to [[barbiturates]] to treat [[insomnia]]. Before long, however, it had become clear that glutethimide was just as likely to cause addiction and caused similarly severe [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms. '''Doriden''' was the brand-name version of the drug; it was also available under the brand names '''Elrodorm''', '''Noxyron''', '''Glimid''' and others. Both the generic and brand-name forms are very rarely prescribed today.  Current production levels in the United States (the annual quota for manufacturing imposed by the DEA has been three grams, enough for six Doriden tablets, for a number of years) point to it only being used in small scale research.

==Long term use==
Long-term use rebound effects, which resembled those seen in withdrawal, have anecdotally been described in patients who were still taking a stable dose of the drug. The symptoms included [[delirium]], [[hallucinosis]], [[convulsions]] and [[fever]].<ref>{{Cite journal

==Recreational use==
Glutethimide is a [[CYP2D6]] enzyme inducer. When taken with [[codeine]],"hits", "cibas and codeine ", it enables the body to convert higher amounts of the codeine (higher than the average 5 - 10%) to [[morphine]].  The general sedative effect also adds to the effect of the combination.  It produces an intense euphoria similar to IV heroin use. The effect was also used clinically, including some research in the 1970s in various countries of using it under carefully monitored circumstances as a form of oral opioid agonist substitution therapy, e.g. as a ''Substitutionmittel'' that may be a useful alternative to methadone.<ref>{{Cite journal

}}</ref> The demand for this combination in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Newark, NYC, Boston, Baltimore, and surrounding areas of other states and perhaps elsewhere, has led to small-scale clandestine synthesis of glutethimide since 1984,<ref>Gahlinger, 2001, pp 203</ref> a process that is, like methaqualone (Quaalude) synthesis, somewhat difficult and fraught with potential bad outcomes when less-than-gifted chemists are doing the deed with industrial-grade precursors without adequate quality control.  The fact that the simpler clandestine synthesis of other extinct pharmaceutical depressants like [[ethchlorvynol]], [[methyprylon]], or the oldest [[barbiturates]] is not reported would seem to point to a high level of motivation surrounding a unique drug, again much like [[methaqualone]]. Doriden was discontinued in the US by manufacturers in 1993. Analysis of confiscated glutethimide seems to invariably show the drug or the results of attempted synthesis, whereas purported methaqualone is in a significant minority of cases found to be inert, or contain [[diphenhydramine]] or [[benzodiazepines]].<ref>Gahlinger, 2001 Ch "Methaqualone & Glutethimide"</ref>

==Chemistry==
Glutethimide (2-ethyl-2-phenylgutarimide) is synthesized by addition of 2-phenylbutyronitrile to the methylacrylate ([[Michael reaction]]), and the subsequent alkaline hydrolysis of the [[nitrile]] group in the obtained compound into an [[amide]] group, and the subsequent acidic cyclization of the product into the desired glutethimide.<ref>
