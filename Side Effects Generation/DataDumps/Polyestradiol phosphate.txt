PEP is used as an [[intramuscular]] injection for [[estrogen therapy (oncology)|estrogen therapy]] of prostate cancer. It is available in combination with [[mepivacaine]], a [[local anaesthetic]], to avoid a burning sensation during application. After injection, it releases the active agent [[estradiol]] over several weeks.<ref name="Austria-Codex" />

Intramuscular PEP has been compared to [[combined androgen blockade]] ([[castration]] + [[flutamide]]) for the treatment of prostate cancer in a large randomized [[clinical trial]] of 915 patients.<ref name="pmid14644018">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sayed Y, Taxel P | title = The use of estrogen therapy in men | journal = Curr Opin Pharmacol | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages = 650–4 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14644018 | doi = | url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid10699602">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hedlund PO, Henriksson P | title = Parenteral estrogen versus total androgen ablation in the treatment of advanced prostate carcinoma: effects on overall survival and cardiovascular mortality.

==Contraindications==
{{Main|Estradiol (medication)#Contraindications}}

The drug has the same contraindications as other forms of estradiol, including active [[thromboembolism]] (such as [[myocardial infarction]]) or high risk for thromboembolic events, [[asthma]], and severe [[hepatic impairment]].<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" /><ref name="Austria-Codex" />

==Side effects==
{{Main|Estradiol (medication)#Adverse effects}}

Although systematic studies of the drug's adverse effects are missing, it is assumed that they are identical to the effects observed under therapy with estradiol and other estrogens. These include nausea, headache, sodium and [[water retention (medicine)|water retention]], gain (but sometimes loss) of body weight, [[impaired glucose tolerance]], and [[mood swing]]s (in 40% of patients). [[Allergic reaction]]s of the skin include itching, [[erythema multiforme]] and, rarely, [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]].<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" /> As thromboembolic complications are associated mainly with [[Oral administration|oral]] estrogens and attributed to the [[first-pass effect]], they are expected to occur less frequently under [[parenteral]] therapies such as PEP.<ref name="Austria-Codex" />

==Overdose==
[[Overdose]] of PEP typically manifests itself by reversible [[feminization (biology)|feminization]].<ref name="Austria-Codex" />

==Interactions==
Estradiol levels may be increased by CYP3A4 inhibitors such as [[erythromycin]], [[clarithromycin]], [[ketoconazole]], [[itraconazole]] and [[grapefruit juice]], and lowered by CYP3A4 [[Enzyme inducer|inducers]] such as [[Hypericum perforatum|St John's wort]], [[barbiturate]]s, [[carbamazepine]] and [[rifampicin]]. The combination with [[COX-2 inhibitor]]s can increase the risk for thromboembolism. Estradiol can also increase the effects of [[glucocorticoid]]s.<ref name="Austria-Codex" /><ref name="Arzneimittel-Interaktionen" />

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
The growth of prostate cancer is generally stimulated by [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT); and unless the cancer is [[Castration-resistant prostate cancer|castration resistant]], it can be treated by depriving it of DHT. Estradiol inhibits the action of DHT by several mechanisms. Firstly, it acts over the [[hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis]] feedback loop by blocking secretion of [[luteinizing hormone]], which reduces [[testosterone]] synthesis in [[Leydig cell]]s in the testicle. It blocks testosterone uptake into [[prostate]] cells, where it would be metabolized to DHT by the enzyme [[5α-reductase]]. Estradiol also inhibits 5α-reductase directly, blocks binding of DHT to [[androgen receptors]], and exhibits [[cytotoxicity]] on prostate cancer cells.<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" /><ref name="Austria-Codex" />

====Antigonadotropic activity====
PEP is [[antigonadotropic]] due to its estrogenic activity.<ref name="HongHolland2010">{{cite book|author1=Waun Ki Hong|author2=James F.

PEP reaches the bloodstream within hours after the injection (90% after 24 hours), and is accumulated in the [[reticuloendothelial system]].<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" /> Estradiol is then cleaved from the polymer by [[phosphatase]]s, although slowly because PEP acts as a phosphatase [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]].<ref name="pmid13151143" /> With monthly injections, stable estradiol concentrations are reached after six to twelve months.<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" /> Estradiol is metabolized primarily in the liver by [[CYP3A4]] and other [[cytochrome]] enzymes, and to a lesser extent in extrahepatic tissues.<ref name="Austria-Codex" /> The metabolites are mainly excreted via the kidneys.

PEP has a very long duration and is given by intramuscular injection once-monthly.<ref name="pmid3242384">{{cite journal | vauthors = Stege R, Carlström K, Collste L, Eriksson A, Henriksson P, Pousette A | title = Single drug polyestradiol phosphate therapy in prostatic cancer | journal = Am.

In light of the fact that [[phosphatase]]s, which cleave PEP into estradiol and phosphoric acid, are present in most tissues in the body, it has been said that the long terminal half-life and slow release of PEP are somewhat surprising.<ref name="pmid3217277" /> Research has found that PEP acts as an [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] of [[alkaline phosphatase]] ''[[in vitro]]'', and it has been proposed that PEP may inhibit its own [[metabolism]].<ref name="pmid3217277" />

==Chemistry==
{{See also|Estrogen ester}}

PEP is a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]] [[estrane]] (C18) [[steroid]] and the C17β [[phosphoric acid]] (phosphate) [[ester]] of [[estradiol]] in the form of a [[polymer]].<ref name="IndexNominum2000" /><ref name="Gangolli1999" /><ref name="pmid3217277" /><ref name="pmid10861754" /> It is also known as '''estradiol polymer with phosphoric acid''' or as '''estradiol 17β-phosphate polymer''', as well as '''estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17β-diol 17β-phosphate polymer'''.<ref name="IndexNominum2000" /><ref name="Gangolli1999" /><ref name="pmid3217277" /><ref name="pmid10861754" /> It has been determined via [[ultracentrifugation]] that the mean [[molecular weight]] of PEP corresponds to a chain length of approximately 13&nbsp;[[repeat unit]]s of estradiol 17β-phosphate.<ref name="pmid3217277" />

===Solubility===
PEP is of very low solubility in water, [[acetone]], [[chloroform]], [[dioxane]], and [[ethanol]], but solves readily in [[base (chemistry)|base]]s, especially in aqueous [[pyridine]].<ref name="Arzneistoff-Profile" />

===Synthesis===
{{Multiple image|align=right|image1=Estradiol.svg|caption1=Estradiol|width1=200|image2=Trichloro-oxide phosphorus.png|caption2=Phosphoryl chloride|width2=143}}

Like polyphosphates of [[polyphenols]], PEP can be prepared from the [[monomer]] (in this case estradiol) and [[phosphoryl chloride]]. The latter reacts with both the phenolic [[hydroxyl]] group in position 3 and the [[aliphatic]] one in position 17. The [[molecular mass]] of the resulting polymer can be controlled by interrupting the reaction after a given time: the longer the reaction is allowed to continue, the higher the mass.<ref name="pmid13151143" /><ref name="synthesis" />

==History==
Pharmacological experiments on estradiol phosphates conducted around 1950 gave rise to the hypothesis that estradiol 3,17β-diphosphate acted as an inhibitor of kidney [[alkaline phosphatase]].<ref name="pmid13151143" /> When the same scientists wanted to synthesize simple phosphates of [[phloretin]], a compound found in apple tree leaves,<ref name="Picinelli" /> they accidentally created a polymer instead.<ref name="synthesis" /> This was later shown to exhibit the same anti-phosphatase properties as estradiol diphosphate, and so it was hypothesized that the original finding was due to contamination with estradiol phosphate polymers.<ref name="pmid13151143" /> Consequently, these polymers were studied in more detail, which resulted in the development of PEP as early as 1953<ref name="pmid25951459" /> and its subsequent introduction in 1957 in the [[United States]].<ref name="Drugs@FDA" /><ref name="Publishing2013" />

==Society and culture==
