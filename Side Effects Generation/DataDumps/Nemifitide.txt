'''Nemifitide''' ('''INN-00835''') is a novel [[antidepressant]] [[drug]] with a [[pentapeptide]] [[chemical structure|structure]] similar to that of [[melanocyte-inhibiting factor]] (MIF-1) and the [[amino acid sequence]] 4-F-Phe-4-OH-Pro-Arg-Gly-Trp-NH<sub>2</sub>.<ref name="FoyeLemke2007" /><ref name="pmid18980729">{{cite journal |pmid=18980729 |year=2008 |last1=Holtzheimer |first1=PE |last2=Nemeroff |first2=CB |title=Novel targets for antidepressant therapies. |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=465–73 |journal=Current psychiatry reports |doi=10.1007/s11920-008-0075-5}}</ref> It is under development by [[Tetragenex]] (previously [[Innapharma, Inc.]]) for the treatment of [[major depressive disorder]].<ref name="Tetragenex">{{cite web | url = http://www.tetragenex.com/technology.html#nem | title = Tetragenex Pharmaceuticals Inc. - Product Technology - Nemifitide | accessdate = 2011-06-13}}</ref> It has been given to over 430 people over the course of 12 [[clinical trial]]s throughout a little over the past decade and has reached [[Clinical trial#Phase III|Phase III]] studies, but has not yet been approved for marketing in any country.<ref name="Tetragenex"/>

Nemifitide has shown mixed efficacy in alleviating depressive symptoms,<ref name="pmid19501541">{{cite journal |pages=291–302 |doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2009.04.617 |title=Emerging targets for antidepressant therapies |year=2009 |last1=Rakofsky |first1=Jeffrey J |last2=Holtzheimer |first2=Paul E |last3=Nemeroff |first3=Charles B |journal=Current Opinion in Chemical Biology |volume=13 |issue=3 |pmid=19501541}}</ref><ref name="Alarcón2004">{{cite book | author = Renato D.

Remarkably, despite having a very short [[half-life]] of only 15–30 minutes,<ref name="FoyeLemke2007"/> in most or all studies assessing its efficacy nemifitide has been administered merely once daily via the subcutaneous route and yet is effective for depression.

The [[mechanism of action]] of nemifitide is unclear, but since MIF-1 has been demonstrated to have similar antidepressant effects<ref name="pmid6138756">{{cite journal |pmid=6138756 |year=1983 |last1=Van Der Velde |first1=CD |title=Rapid clinical effectiveness of MIF-I in the treatment of major depressive illness |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=297–300 |journal=Peptides |doi=10.1016/0196-9781(83)90136-5}}</ref> it may act in an analogous manner.<ref name="FoyeLemke2007"/><ref name="pmid18980729" /> Possibly of interest however is that nemifitide binds to several [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s including [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]] (where it has been shown to act as an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]]), [[Neuropeptide Y receptor|NPY<sub>1</sub>]], [[Bombesin receptor|bombesin]], and [[Melanocortin 4 receptor|MC<sub>4</sub>]] and [[Melanocortin 5 receptor|MC<sub>5</sub>]], though at only [[molar concentration|micromolar concentration]]s.<ref name="Alarcón2004"/> Whether any of these relatively weak actions are of any clinical significance is unclear.
