==Terminology==
Phytomenadione is often called phylloquinone or vitamin K,<ref name="pmid7086539">{{cite journal |last1=Haroon|first1= Y. |last2=Shearer |first2=M. J. |last3=Rahim|first3= S. |last4=Gunn |first4=W.

Sometimes a distinction is made between phylloquinone, which is considered to be a natural substance, and phytonadione, which is considered to be a synthetic substance.<ref name="urlVitamin K">{{cite web |url=http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/vitamin-k-000343.htm |title=Vitamin K |work= |accessdate=2009-03-18}}</ref>

A [[stereoisomer]] of phylloquinone is called vitamin k<sub>1</sub> (note the difference in capitalization).

==Chemistry==
Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin that is stable in air and moisture but decomposes in sunlight. It is a [[Polycyclic compound|polycyclic]] [[aromatic]] [[ketone]], based on 2-[[methyl]]-[[1,4-naphthoquinone]], with a 3-[[phytane|phytyl]] [[substituent]]. It is found naturally in a wide variety of green plants, particularly in leaves, since it functions as an electron acceptor during [[photosynthesis]], forming part of the electron transport chain of [[photosystem I]].

Phylloquinone is an electron acceptor during [[photosynthesis]], forming part of the electron transport chain of [[Photosystem I]].

The best-known function of vitamin K in animals is as a cofactor in the formation of [[coagulation factor]]s II ([[prothrombin]]), VII, IX, and X by the liver. It is also required for the formation of anticoagulant factors protein C and S. It is commonly used to treat [[warfarin]] toxicity, and as an antidote for [[coumatetralyl]].

Vitamin K is required for bone protein formation.
