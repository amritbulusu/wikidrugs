'''Methaqualone''', sold under the brand name '''Quaalude''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|eɪ|l|uː|d}}; {{respell|KWAY|lood}}) and sometimes stylized "Quāālude"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rile|first1=Karen|title=Winter Music|date=1983|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|location=Boston and Toronto|isbn=0-316-74657-6|pages=41, 59|edition=First}}</ref> in the US and '''Mandrax''' in the UK and South Africa, is a [[sedative]] and [[hypnotic]] medication. It is a member of the [[quinazolinone]] class.

<!-- History, society and culture -->
The sedative–hypnotic activity of methaqualone was first noted by researchers in the 1950s. In 1962, methaqualone was patented in the US by Wallace and Tiernan.<ref>{{US Patent|3135659}} – Hydroxy and Alkoxy Aryl Quinazolones</ref> Its use peaked in the early 1970s as a [[hypnotic]], for the treatment of [[insomnia]], and as a [[sedative]] and [[muscle relaxant]]. 

Methaqualone became increasingly popular as a [[recreational drug]] and [[club drug]] in the late 1960s and 1970s, known variously as "ludes" or "sopers" (also "soaps") in the U.S. and "mandrakes" and "mandies" in the UK, Australia and New Zealand.  

==Uses==

===Medical===
Methaqualone is a [[sedative]] that increases the activity of the [[GABA receptor]]s in the brain and nervous system. When GABA activity is increased, blood pressure drops and the breathing and pulse rates slow, leading to a state of deep relaxation. These properties explain why methaqualone was originally mainly prescribed for insomnia.<ref>{{cite web|title=methaqualone reference |url=http://www.enotes.com/methaqualone-reference/methaqualone |publisher=Enotes |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223014958/http://www.enotes.com/methaqualone-reference/methaqualone |archivedate=February 23, 2012 }}</ref> Methaqualone peaks in the bloodstream within several hours, with a half-life of 20–60 hours. Regular users build up a physical tolerance, requiring larger doses for the same effect. Overdose can lead to nervous system shutdown, coma and death.<ref>{{cite web|title=recreational drugs tranquilizers|url=http://www.druglibrary.eu/library/books/recreationaldrugs/tranquilizers.htm|publisher=drug library eu}}</ref>

Methaqualone is not recommended for use while pregnant and is in [[pregnancy category#United States|pregnancy category D]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Drug Safety|title=Methaqualone in Pregnancy and Breastfeeding|url=http://thedrugsafety.com/methaqualone/|accessdate=15 August 2012}}</ref>

===Overdose===
An [[overdose]] can cause [[delirium]], [[convulsion]]s, [[hypertonia]], [[hyperreflexia]], [[vomiting]], [[kidney failure]], [[coma]], and [[death]] through [[cardiac arrest|cardiac]] or [[respiratory arrest]]. It resembles barbiturate poisoning, but with increased motor difficulties and a lower incidence of cardiac or respiratory depression. The standard one tablet adult dose of Quaalude was 300&nbsp;mg when made by Lemmon. A dose of 8000&nbsp;mg is lethal and a dose as little as 2000&nbsp;mg could induce a coma if taken with an [[alcoholic beverage]].<ref name="Linder">{{cite news|last=Linder|first=Lee|title=Quaalude manufacturer: Image hurt by street use|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2199&dat=19810528&id=VpkyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=D-gFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4915,6415336|accessdate=16 August 2013|newspaper=Lawrence Journal-World|date=28 May 1981|agency=Associated Press|page=6|quote=Eckman/Fisher}}</ref>

==Drug testing==
Urine drug test of gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) confirmation up to 90 hours after the last intake is a practical way of detecting methaqualone use.<ref>{{cite journal|title=methaqualone drug testing| pmid=1262091 | volume=11 | journal=Int J Addict| pages=237-44 | last1 = Rock | first1 = NL | last2 = Moore | first2 = RJ}}</ref> To avoid a false positive, [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA) determined the initial cut off level of 300&nbsp;ng/ml for forensic and workplace drug testing of methaqualone. Only after testing at over 200&nbsp;ng/ml is a person be considered positive, and possibly subject to penalties or workplace disciplinary action.<ref>{{cite web|title=methaqualone drug testing|url=http://www.testcountry.com/wiki/methaqualone-facts-drug-testing.html#testingmethaqualone|publisher=Testcountry}}</ref> As reported by Quest Diagnostics in 2011, methaqualone had a 0% positive drug testing rate in the US, making it one of the least used recreational drugs in that year.<ref>{{cite web|title=workplace drug test positive rates|url=http://www.questdiagnostics.com/home/physicians/health-trends/drug-testing|publisher=quest diagnostics}}</ref>

Information provided by government, industrial, and academic sources most notably quoted in the textbook "Illegal Drugs" (Gahlinger, 2001) and some more in depth media reports list [[diphenhydramine]] and ostensibly other ethanolamine antihistamines as a potential source of methaqualone false-positives on immunoassay drug tests.  Confirmation by low pressure vapour phase chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) should clear up the matter. Whether quinine and its relatives also have the potential to cause false positives is not known.

==History==
Methaqualone was first synthesized in India in 1951 by [[Indra Kishore Kacker]] and Syed Hussain Zaheer, for use as an [[antimalarial drug]].<ref name=Linder /><ref>{{cite journal | last=van Zyl | first=Etienne F. | year = 2001 | title = A survey of reported synthesis of methaqualone and some positional and structural isomers  | url = | journal = Forensic Science International | volume = 122 | issue = 2–3| pages = 142–149 | doi = 10.1016/S0379-0738(01)00484-4 }}</ref><ref>Potential Analgesics. Part I. Synthesis of substituted 4-quinazolones, I. K. Kacker and S. H. Zaheer, ''J. Ind. Chem. Soc.'' '''28''' (1951), pp. 344–346.</ref> By 1965, it was the most commonly prescribed sedative in Britain, where it has been sold legally under the names Malsed, Malsedin, and Renoval. In 1965, a methaqualone/antihistamine combination was sold as the sedative drug Mandrax, by Roussel Laboratories (now part of [[Sanofi-Aventis]]). In 1972, it was the sixth-bestselling sedative in the US,<ref>''[http://www.drugabuse.gov/pdf/monographs/32.pdf GC/MS Assays for Abused Drugs in Body fluids]'', p. 39</ref> where it was legal under the [[brand name]] Quaalude. Quaalude in the United States was originally manufactured in 1965 by the Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, based pharmaceutical firm William H. Rorer Inc. The drug name "Quaalude" combined the words "quiet interlude" and shared a stylistic reference to another drug marketed by the firm, [[Maalox]].<ref name="Time">{{cite journal |title=Dividends: Dropping the Last 'Lude |journal=Time |date=28 November 1983 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926386,00.html |accessdate=16 August 2013}}</ref>

In 1978, Rorer sold the rights to manufacture Quaalude to the Lemmon Company of Sellersville, Pennsylvania. At that time, Rorer chairman John Eckman commented on  Quaalude's bad reputation stemming from illegal manufacture and use of methaqualone, and illegal sale and use of legally prescribed Quaalude: "Quaalude accounted for less than 2% of our sales but created 98% of our headaches."<ref name=Linder /> Both companies still regarded Quaalude as an excellent sleeping drug. Lemmon, well aware of Quaalude's public image problems, used advertisements in medical journals to urge physicians "not to permit the abuses of illegal users to deprive a legitimate patient of the drug".  Lemmon also marketed a small quantity under another name, Mequin, so doctors could prescribe the drug without the negative connotations.<ref name=Linder /> The rights to Quaalude were held by the JB Roerig & Company division of Pfizer, before the drug was discontinued in the United States in 1985, mainly due to its psychological addictiveness and recreational use.<ref>{{cite web |title=Quaaludes Again |first=Shel |last=Silverstein |publisher=Captain Wayne's Mad Music.com |url=http://www.madmusic.com/song_details.aspx?SongID=12080}}</ref>

The 2013 film ''[[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|The Wolf of Wall Street]]'' included a depiction of Quaalude intoxication (and driving under the influence) by [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]'s character. Later, headlines were focused on Quaaludes after a deposition became public where [[Bill Cosby]] admitted under oath that he had given the drug to women with whom he wanted to have sex.<ref>Harry Low and Tom Heyden (9 July 2015) [http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33428487 The rise and fall of Quaaludes] BBC News Magazine. Accessed 9 July 2015.</ref>

As mentioned above, methaqualone is a common recreational and self-medication drug in South Africa and other of the former [[Frontline States]], including Mozambique, Angola, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Some percentage of this consumption, as well as on the European and Near East clandestine drug markets, was/is in all probability sourced from the massive cache of powder and tabletted methaqualone produced under the aegis of the apartheid-era South African government's [[Project Coast]] in a segment thereof directed by [[Wouter Basson|Dr Wouter Basson]] (whose "Brownies" are capsules of pure [[MDMA]] in doses of up to 135&nbsp;mg), who at one point was held by police in Croatia carrying $40m in Vatican bearer bonds when attempting to purchase 500 kilos of methaqualone.  The methaqualone and MDMA, along with [[cocaine]] and other empathogens and aphrodisiacs as well as muscle relaxants and incapacitating anticholinergic deliriants were considered for non-lethal riot-control use.  The entire drug cache disappeared into the underground in the final days of the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]]'s tenure in office. The total methaqualone cache may have approached a ton.<ref>Levenda, pp 302-303{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}</ref>

North, Central, and South American clandestine drug markets typically source the drug from industrial-scale illegal drug labs in Mexico, Colombia, Belize, Peru and elsewhere. Smaller labs occasionally are uncovered in the United States and Canada and the final percentage of methaqualone as well as mecloqualone, other chemical relatives, other congeners, and unreacted precursors form a chemical profile which can be used as a fingerprint to identify the likely origin of batches of the drug just as such things as morphine content and its relation to heroin content and presence of codeine, acetylcodeine, noscapine, papaverine, and other opium components form a chemical fingerprint for batches of heroin.<ref name="NCOCTL Bulletin Volume XXV pp 3">NCOCTL Bulletin Volume XXV, No 2, pp 3 sidebar "Blast From The Past"</ref>

Methaqualone is also a minor product of drug labs in Lebanon's Biqa Valley (also a supplier to African markets) and in all likelihood is produced for fundraising purposes by some combatants in the current Syrian Civil War{{Citation needed|reason=Speculation?|date=August 2017}}, as is the case with heroin, opium, morphine, fentanyl analogues, Captagon, first generation amphetamines, cannabis, hashish and others.  The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a well-known industrial-scale producer of drugs such as dextromethamphetamine (Ice, Shabu, etc.) and other sympathomimetic stimulants for export to Asian and Australian clandestine drug markets and may supply some amount of methaqualone as well.<ref name="NCOCTL Bulletin Volume XXV pp 3"/>

==Society and culture==
===Regulation===
Methaqualone was initially placed in Schedule I as defined by the UN Convention of Psychotropic Substances, but was moved to Schedule II in 1979. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.incb.org/incb/en/psychotropic-substances/green-lists.html|title=green-lists|last=lilian.sandouk|website=www.incb.org|access-date=2017-09-06}}</ref>

In Canada, methaqualone is listed in Schedule III of the [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act]] and requires a prescription but is Schedule I according to NAPRA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://napra.ca/pages/Schedules/Search.aspx|title=Search National Drug Schedule|publisher=}}</ref> Methaqualone is banned in India.<ref name=ban>{{cite web|url=http://cdsco.nic.in/html/drugsbanned.html |title=Drugs banned in India |publisher=Central Drugs Standard Control Organization, Dte.GHS, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India |accessdate=2013-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221053621/http://cdsco.nic.in/html/drugsbanned.html |archivedate=2015-02-21 |df= }}</ref>

===Recreational===
[[File:Quaalude.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A variety of Quaalude pills and capsules.]]
Methaqualone became increasingly popular as a [[recreational drug]] in the late 1960s and 1970s, known variously as "ludes" or "sopers" (also "soaps") in the U.S. and "mandrakes" and "mandies" in the UK, Australia and New Zealand. 

The drug was more tightly regulated in Britain under the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]] and in the U.S. from 1973. It was withdrawn from many developed markets in the early 1980s. In the United States it was withdrawn in 1982 and made a [[Schedule I (US)|Schedule I]] drug in 1984.  It has a DEA ACSCN of 2565 and in 2013 the aggregate annual manufacturing quota for the US was 10 grams.  Mention of its possible use in some types of cancer and AIDS has periodically appeared in the literature since the late 1980s; research does not appear to have reached an advanced stage.  The DEA has also added the methaqualone analogue [[mecloqualone]] (also a result of some incomplete clandestine syntheses) to Schedule I
as ACSCN 2572, and zero manufacturing quota.

Gene Haislip, the former head of the Chemical Control Division of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), told the PBS documentary program ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'': "We beat 'em." By working with governments and manufacturers around the world, the DEA was able to halt production and, Haislip says, "eliminated the problem".<ref name="frontline20120515">{{cite news|url= https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/meth/ |title=The Meth Epidemic – Haislip discusses parallels to current Methamphetamine epidemic}}</ref><ref>Ferns, Sean, [http://www.deamuseum.org/education/transcripts/DEAM_GeneHaislip_102507.pdf "Lecture: Gene Haislip : The Chemical Connection: A Historical Perspective on Chemical Control"], ''Drug Enforcement Administration Museum Lecture Series'', Arlington, Virginia, October 25, 2007</ref><ref>Piccini, Sara, [http://alumni.wm.edu/magazine/spring10/drug.pdf "DRUG WARRIOR: THE DEA’S GENE HAISLIP ’60, B.C.L. ’63 BATTLED WORLDWIDE AGAINST THE ILLEGAL DRUG TRADE – AND SCORED A RARE VICTORY"], ''William & Mary Alumni Magazine'', [[The College of William & Mary]], Spring 2010</ref> Methaqualone was manufactured in the United States under the name Quaalude by the pharmaceutical firms [[Rorer]] and Lemmon with the numbers 714 stamped on the tablet, so people often referred to Quaalude as 714s, "Lemmons", or "Lemmon 7s". Methaqualone was also manufactured in the US under the trade names Sopor and Parest.   After the legal manufacture of the drug ended in the United States in 1982, underground laboratories in [[Mexico]] continued illegal manufacture of methaqualone all through the 1980s, continuing the use of the "714" stamp, until their popularity waned in the early 1990s. Purported methaqualone is in a significant minority of cases found to be inert, or contain diphenhydramine or benzodiazepines.

Methaqualone is one of the most commonly used recreational drugs in [[South Africa]].<ref name="SA">{{cite web|url=http://www.drugaware.co.za/mandrax.html|title=Mandrax|year=2003|work=DrugAware|publisher=Reality Media|accessdate=2009-08-13}}</ref><ref name="Cochrane">{{cite journal | pmid = 15846700 | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004146.pub2 | issue=2 | title=Treatment for methaqualone dependence in adults | year=2005 | pages=CD004146 | journal=Reviews | last1 = McCarthy | first1 = G | last2 = Myers | first2 = B | last3 = Siegfried | first3 = N}}</ref> It is also popular elsewhere in Africa and in India.<ref name="Cochrane"/>
