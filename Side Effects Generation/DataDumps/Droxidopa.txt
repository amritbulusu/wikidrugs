'''Droxidopa''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]; trade name '''Northera'''; also known as '''<small>L</small>-DOPS''', '''<small>L</small>-''threo''-dihydroxyphenylserine''', '''L-''threo''-DOPS''' and '''SM-5688''') is a  [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] [[amino acid]] [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] which acts as a [[prodrug]] to the [[neurotransmitter]] [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline).<ref name="Goldstein">{{cite journal | author=Goldstein, DS | title=L-Dihydroxyphenylserine (L-DOPS): a norepinephrine prodrug | journal=Cardiovasc Drug Rev | year=2006 | volume=24 | issue=3-4 | pmid=17214596 | pages=189–203 | doi=10.1111/j.1527-3466.2006.00189.x}}</ref> Unlike norepinephrine, droxidopa is capable of crossing the protective [[blood–brain barrier]] (BBB).<ref name="Goldstein"/>

==Indications==
* [[Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension]] (NOH) dopamine beta hydrolase deficiency,<ref name="Mathias">{{cite journal | author=Mathias, Christopher J | title=L-dihydroxyphenylserine (Droxidopa) in the treatment of orthostatic hypotension | journal=Clin Auton Res | year=2008 | volume=18 | issue= Supplement 1 | pages=25–29 | doi=10.1007/s10286-007-1005-z}}</ref> as well as NOH associated with [[multiple system atrophy]] (MSA), [[familial amyloid polyneuropathy]] (FAP), [[pure autonomic failure]] (PAF).
* [[Intradialytic hypotension]] (IDH) or [[hemodialysis]]-induced [[hypotension]].
* Freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease (off-label)

==History==
Droxidopa was developed by [[Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals]] for the [[therapy|treatment]] of [[hypotension]], including NOH,<ref name="Mathias"/> and NOH associated with various [[disease|disorder]]s such as MSA, FAP, and PD, as well as IDH. The drug has been used in [[Japan]] and some surrounding [[Asia]]n areas for these [[indication (medicine)|indication]]s since 1989. Following a merger with [[Dainippon Pharmaceuticals]] in 2006, [[Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma]] licensed droxidopa to [[Chelsea Therapeutics]] to [[drug development|develop]] and [[Marketing|market]] it [[world]]wide except in Japan, [[Korea]], [[China]], and [[Taiwan]].  In February 2014, the Food and Drug Administration approved droxidopa for the treatment of symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension.<ref>{{cite news | title = FDA grants accelerated approval to NORTHERA (droxidopa) for patients with symptomatic NOH | url = http://www.news-medical.net/news/20140218/FDA-grants-accelerated-approval-to-NORTHERA-(droxidopa)-for-patients-with-symptomatic-NOH.aspx | date = February 18, 2014 | publisher = news-medical.net}}</ref>

===Clinical trials===
Chelsea Therapeutics obtained [[orphan drug status]] (ODS) for droxidopa in the U.S. for NOH, and that of which associated with PD, PAF, and MSA. In 2014, Chelsea Therapeutics was acquired by Lundbeck along with the rights to droxidopa which was launched in the US in Sept 2014.<ref>http://investor.lundbeck.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=846443 http://lundbeck.com/upload/us/files/pdf/2014_Releases/NORTHERA%20Availability%20press%20release%209.2.14.pdf</ref>

==Pharmacology==
Droxidopa is a [[prodrug]] of [[norepinephrine]] used to increase the [[concentration]]s of these [[neurotransmitter]]s in the [[human body|body]] and [[brain]].<ref name="Goldstein"/>  It is [[metabolized]] by [[aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase]] (AAAD), also known as DOPA decarboxylase (DDC). Patients with NOH have [[chemical imbalance|depleted level]]s of norepinephrine which leads to decreased [[blood pressure]] or [[hypotension]] upon [[orthostatic]] challenge.<ref name="Robertson">{{cite journal | author=Robertson, David | title=The pathophysiology and diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension | journal=Clin Auton Res | year=2008 | volume=18 | issue= Supplement 1 | pages=2–7 | doi=10.1007/s10286-007-1004-0}}</ref> Droxidopa works by increasing the levels of norepinephrine in the [[peripheral nervous system]] (PNS), thus enabling the body to maintain [[blood flow]] upon and while [[standing]].

Droxidopa can also cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] (BBB) where it is converted to norepinephrine from within the brain.<ref name="Goldstein"/> Increased levels of norepinephrine in the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) may be beneficial to patients in a wide range of indications. Droxidopa can be coupled with a peripheral [[aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor]] (AAADI) or [[Dopa decarboxylase inhibitor|DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor]] (DDC) such as [[carbidopa]] (Lodosyn) to increase central norepinephrine concentrations while minimizing increases of peripheral levels.

==Side effects==
With over 20 years on the market, droxidopa has proven to have few [[Adverse effect|side effect]]s of which most are mild. The most common side effects reported in clinical trials include headache, dizziness nausea, hypertension and fatigue.<ref>{{cite journal
