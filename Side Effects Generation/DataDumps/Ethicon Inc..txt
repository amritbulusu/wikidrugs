'''Ethicon, Inc.''' is a subsidiary of [[Johnson & Johnson]]. It was incorporated as a separate company under the Johnson & Johnson umbrella in 1949 to expand and diversify the Johnson & Johnson product line.

Ethicon has manufactured [[surgical suture]]s and wound closure devices since 1887. After [[World War II]], Ethicon's market share in surgical sutures rose from 15% to 70% worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} In the [[United States]], the market share is approximately 80%.

Ethicon conducts business in 52 countries.

==Corporate history==

In 1915, [[George F. Merson]] opened a facility in Edinburgh for the manufacturing, packaging and sterilising of catgut, silk and nylon sutures. Johnson & Johnson acquired Mr. Merson's company in 1947, and this was renamed Ethicon Suture Laboratories.<ref>{{cite web |title=ETHICON History |url=http://www.ethiconproducts.co.uk/about/ethicon-history |website=Ethicon Products.co.uk |accessdate=25 January 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110154950/http://www.ethiconproducts.co.uk/about/ethicon-history |archivedate=10 January 2016 |df=}}</ref> In 1953 this became Ethicon Inc.<ref>{{cite web |title=A history of advancing surgery |url=http://www.ethicon.com/corporate/our-commitment/history |website=Ethicon U.S. |accessdate=25 January 2016}}</ref>

In 1992, Ethicon was restructured, and Ethicon Endo-Surgery became a separate [[corporation|corporate entity]].<ref name=MMM2013/>

During the 1990s, Ethicon diversified into new and advanced products and technologies and formed four different companies under the Ethicon umbrella, each of which specialize in different products.

In November 2008, the wound management business was sold to [[One Equity Partners]] and became Systagenix Wound Management Limited.

In 2009, Ethicon acquired breast implant maker [[Mentor (company)|Mentor]], and in 2010 it acquired ear, nose and throat technology company [[Acclarent]]. In 2016, Ethicon acquired NeuWave Medical.

In 2013, J&J merged Ethicon Endo-Surgery back into Ethicon.<ref name=MMM2013>{{cite news |last1=Arnold |first1=Matthew |title=J&J consolidates, rebrands Ethicon units |url=http://www.mmm-online.com/channel/jj-consolidates-rebrands-ethicon-units/article/292544/ |work=Medical Marketing & Media |date=8 May 2013}}</ref>

===Gynecare Prolift controversy===
Much controversy surrounds Ethicon's transvaginal meshes used on patients with [[female genital prolapse]].

Of these meshes, the most important, Ethicon's ''Gynecare Prolift'', was introduced in March 2005. Ethicon's parent company Johnson & Johnson utilized the [[Food & Drug Administration|FDA]]'s ''501(k) clearance method'', which allows a product to be sold without official FDA approval if it is based on another already approved product. However, in 2008, the FDA issued a [[Public Health Notification]] regarding reports of serious complications associated with transvaginal mesh devices. This further escalated when, in 2011, the agency received more than 1,000 adverse effect reports from surgical mesh manufacturers. The FDA decided to order Ethicon and other transvaginal mesh manufacturers to cease production until extensive testing and research on each of vaginal mesh device was conducted. In June 2012, following the FDA's order for additional testing, Johnson & Johnson permanently removed all Prolift products from the market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.girardgibbs.com/gynecare-prolift-mesh/ |title=Ethicon Gynecare Prolift Mesh - Vaginal Mesh Lawsuit |website=Girard Gibbs |accessdate=1 October 2017}}</ref>

In one court case reported by [[Reuters]], the [[plaintiff]], Dianne Bellew, on whom the product had been implanted in 2009, said she was never warned about how the device could contract and erode, causing pain and scarring.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/health-weekahead/week-ahead-in-health-march-2-2015-idUSL1N0W40LR20150302 |title=Week Ahead in Health: March 2, 2015 |date=2 March 2015 |website=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=1 October 2017}}</ref>
