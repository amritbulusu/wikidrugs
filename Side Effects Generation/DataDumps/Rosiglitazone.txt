'''Rosiglitazone''' (trade name '''Avandia''') is an [[antidiabetic drug]] in the [[thiazolidinedione]] class. It works as an [[insulin]] sensitizer, by binding to the [[PPAR]] in fat cells and making the cells more responsive to insulin. It is marketed by the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) as a stand-alone drug or for use in combination with [[metformin]] or with [[glimepiride]]. First released in 1999, annual sales peaked at approximately $2.5-billion in 2006; however, following a [[meta-analysis]] published in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]] in 2007 that linked the drug's use to an increased risk of [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]],<ref name="pmid17517853">{{cite journal |vauthors=Nissen SE, Wolski K | title = Effect of rosiglitazone on the risk of myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular causes | journal = N.

==Medical uses==
Rosiglitazone was approved by the US FDA in 1999 and by the EMEA in 2000;  the EMEA however required two postmarketing studies on longterm adverse effects, one for chronic heart failure and the other for cardiovascular effects.<ref name="ema_recommend_suspend"/>  The drug was approved for glycemic control in people with [[type 2 diabetes]], as measured by glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) as a surrogate endpoint, similar to that of other oral antidiabetic drugs.<ref name="pmid17636824">{{cite journal |vauthors=Richter B, Bandeira-Echtler E, Bergerhoff K, Clar C, Ebrahim SH | title = Rosiglitazone for type 2 diabetes mellitus | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = | issue = 3 | pages = CD006063 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17636824 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006063.pub2 }}</ref><ref name="pmid18955635">{{cite journal |vauthors=Selvin E, Bolen S, Yeh HC, Wiley C, Wilson LM, Marinopoulos SS, Feldman L, Vassy J, Wilson R, Bass EB, Brancati FL | title = Cardiovascular outcomes in trials of oral diabetes medications: a systematic review | journal = Arch.

==Efficacy==
Published studies did not provide evidence that patient-oriented outcomes like mortality, morbidity, adverse effects, costs and health-related quality of life are positively influenced by rosiglitazone.<ref name=pmid17636824 />

== Adverse effects ==

===Heart failure===
One of the safety concerns identified before approval was fluid retention. Moreover, the combination of rosiglitazone with insulin resulted in a higher rate of congestive heart failure. In Europe there were contraindications for use in heart failure and combination with insulin.<ref name="pmid21153629">{{cite journal|vauthors=Blind E, Dunder K, de Graeff PA, Abadie E |title=Rosiglitazone: a European regulatory perspective |journal=Diabetologia |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=213–8 |year=2011 |pmid=21153629 |doi=10.1007/s00125-010-1992-5 |url=http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/463/art%253A10.1007%252Fs00125-010-1992-5.pdf?auth66=1396284399_e9eda8c8a55934cf7cd09f8200c7c012&ext=.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330004537/http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/463/art%253A10.1007%252Fs00125-010-1992-5.pdf?auth66=1396284399_e9eda8c8a55934cf7cd09f8200c7c012&ext=.pdf |archivedate=2014-03-30 |df= }}</ref>

A meta analysis of all trials from 2010 confirmed a higher risk of heart failure and a double risk when rosiglitazone was administered as add-on therapy to insulin.<ref name="pmid19328563">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mannucci E, Monami M, Di Bari M, Lamanna C, Gori F, Gensini GF, Marchionni N | title = Cardiac safety profile of rosiglitazone: a comprehensive meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials | journal = Int.

===Heart attacks===
The relative risk of ischemic cardiac events seen in pre-approval trials of rosiglitazone was similar to that of comparable drugs, but there was increased LDL cholesterol, LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio, triglycerides and weight.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nissen|first=Steven|title=Rosiglitazone a critical overview.

In 2005, at the insistence of the World Health Organization, GSK performed a meta-analysis of all 37 trials involving use of rosiglitazone, finding a hazard ratio of 1.29 (0.99 to 1.89). 
In 2006 the GSK updated the analysis, now including 42 trials and showing a hazard ratio of 1.31 (1.01 to 1.70). A large observational study comparing patients treated with rosiglitizone with patients treated with other diabetes therapies was performed at the same time and found a relative risk of 0.93 (95% C.I. 0.8 to 1.1) for those treated with rosiglitazone.  The information was passed to the FDA and posted on the company website, but not otherwise published. GSK provided these analyses to the FDA, but neither the company nor the FDA warned prescribers or patients of the hazard.<ref name="Nissen">{{cite web|last=Nissen|first=Steven|title=Rosiglitazone: a case of regulatory  hubris|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f7428|publisher=BMJ}}</ref> According to the FDA, the Agency did not issue a safety bulletin because the results of the meta analysis conflicted with those of the observational study and with the results of the ADOPT trial.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Testimony/ucm153838.htm |title=Safety of Rosiglitazone Maleate (Avandia) |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

A [[meta-analysis]] in May 2007 reported the use of rosiglitazone was associated with a 1.4 fold increased risk of [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and a numerically higher (but non-significant) increase in risk of death from all cardiovascular diseases against control. It contained 42 trials of which 27 were unpublished.<ref name="pmid17517853" /> Another meta analysis of 4 trials with follow-up longer than 1 year found similar results.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Singh|first=S|author2=Loke, YK |author3=Furberg, CD |title=Long-term risk of cardiovascular events with rosiglitazone: a meta-analysis.|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|date=Sep 12, 2007|volume=298|issue=10|pages=1189–95|pmid=17848653|doi=10.1001/jama.298.10.1189}}</ref> Nissen's meta analysis was criticized in an 2007 article by George Diamond ''et al'' in the [[Annals of Internal Medicine]].  The authors concluded that Nissens' analysis had excluded trials with important data on the cardiovascular profile of rosiglitazone, had inappropriately combined trials of greatly differing design, and had inappropriately excluded trials with no cardiovascular events. The authors concluded that no firm conclusion could be drawn regarding whether rosiglitazone increased or decreased cardiovascular risk.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Diamond GA, Bax L, Kaul S |title=Uncertain effects of rosiglitazone on the risk for myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death |journal=Ann.

Noting the recent publication by Nissen, they repeated their meta analysis including only the trials included in the Nissen study that dealt with Type II diabetics. (The Nissen study included some trials in people with other disorders.) They did not find a statistically significant increase in cardiovascular events, but noted that all of the cardiovascular endpoints they analyzed showed a non-significant trend toward worse outcomes in the rosiglitazone arms.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Richter B, Bandeira-Echtler E, Bergerhoff K, Clar C, Ebrahim SH |title=Rosiglitazone for type 2 diabetes mellitus |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=3 |pages=CD006063 |year=2007 |pmid=17636824 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006063.pub2 |url=}}</ref>

In July 2007 the FDA held a joint meeting of the Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee.  FDA scientist Joy Mele presented a meta analysis examining the cardiovascular risk of rosiglitazone in completed clinical trials.  The study found an overall 1.4x increase in risk of cardiovascular ischemic events relative to the control arms. The results were heterogenous, with clear evidence of increased risk relative to placebo but not relative to other diabetes treatments and higher risk associated with combinations of rosiglitazone with insulin or metformin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/07/slides/2007-4308s1-00-index.htm |title=Dockets: |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> Based on the 1.4x increased risk relative to control groups, FDA scientist David Graham presented an analysis suggesting that rosiglitazone had caused 83,000 excess heart attacks between 1999 and 2007.<ref name=Senatereport>[http://www.finance.senate.gov/newsroom/chairman/download/?id=9e4b091f-de21-4df1-b65e-b227d74bec12 "Staff report on GlaxoSmithKline and the diabetes drug Avandia"], Committee on Finance, United States Senate, January 2010.</ref>{{rp|4}}<ref name=Graham>[[David Graham (epidemiologist)|David Graham]], [http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/07/slides/2007-4308s1-08-fda-graham_files/frame.htm "Assessment of the cardiovascular risks and health benefits of rosiglitazone"], Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology, Food and Drug Administration, 30 July 2007.</ref> The advisory panel voted 20 : 3 that the evidence available indicated that rosiglitazone increased the risk of cardiovascular events and 22 : 1 that the overall risk:benefit ratio of rosiglitazone justified its continued marketing in the United States. The FDA placed restrictions on the drug, including adding a [[boxed warning]] about heart attacks, but did not withdraw it.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2007/ucm109026.htm "FDA Adds Boxed Warning for Heart-related Risks to Anti-Diabetes Drug Avandia. Agency says drug to remain on market, while safety assessment continues"], Food and Drug Administration, 14 November 2007.</ref>

In 2000 a study to address the concerns regarding cardiovascular safety was requested by the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA). GSK agreed to perform post-marketing a long-term cardiovascular morbidity/mortality study in patients on rosiglitazone in combination with a sulfonylurea or metformin: the RECORD study. The results as published in 2009 showed that rosiglitazone was non-inferior to treatment with metformin or a suflonylurea with respect to the rate of cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death. European regulators concluded that due in part to design limitations, the results neither proved nor eliminated concerns of excess cardiovascular risk.<ref name=pmid21153629 />

In February 2010, the FDA's associate director of drug safety, recommended rosiglitazone be taken off the market. In June 2010, they published a retrospective study comparing roziglitazone to pioglitazone, the other thiazolidinedione marketed in the United States and concluded rosiglitazone was associated with "an increased risk of stroke, heart failure, and all-cause mortality and an increased risk of the composite of AMI, stroke, heart failure, or all-cause mortality in patients 65 years or older".<ref name="pmid20584880">{{cite journal |vauthors=Graham DJ, Ouellet-Hellstrom R, MaCurdy TE, Ali F, Sholley C, Worrall C, Kelman JA | title = Risk of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and death in elderly Medicare patients treated with rosiglitazone or pioglitazone | journal = JAMA | volume = 304 | issue = 4 | pages = 411–8 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20584880 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2010.920 }}</ref> The [[number needed to harm]] with roziglitazone was sixty. Graham argued rosiglitazone caused 500 more heart attacks and 300 more heart failures than its main competitor.

A meta-analysis of 16 observational studies released in March, 2011, compared rosiglitazone to pioglitazone, finding support for greater cardiovascular safety for pioglitazone. The meta-analysis involved 810 000 patients taking rosiglitazone or [[pioglitazone]].

In Europe rosiglitazone was contraindicated for heart failure or history of heart failure with regard to all NYHA stages, for combined use with insulin and for acute coronary syndrome.<ref name=pmid21153629 /> The European Medicines Agency recommended on 23 September 2010 that Avandia be suspended from the European market.<ref name="ema_recommend_suspend"/><ref name="bbc_ema_suspension"/>

==Pharmacology==
[[File:Avandia 2mg oral tablet.jpg|thumb|Two Avandia 2 mg oral tablets]]
Rosiglitazone is a member of the thiazolidinedione class of drugs. Thiazolidinediones act as insulin sensitizers. They reduce glucose, fatty acid, and insulin blood concentrations. They work by binding to the [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor]]s (PPARs). PPARs are transcription factors that reside in the nucleus and become activated by ligands such as thiazolidinediones. Thiazolidinediones enter the cell, bind to the nuclear receptors, and alter the expression of genes. The several PPARs include PPARα, PPARβ/δ, and PPARγ. Thiazolidinediones bind to [[Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma|PPARγ]]. 

PPARs are expressed in fat cells, cells of the liver, muscle, heart, and inner wall (endothelium) and smooth muscle of blood vessels. PPARγ is expressed mainly in fat tissue, where it regulates genes involved in fat cell (adipocyte) differentiation, fatty acid uptake and storage, and glucose uptake. It is also found in pancreatic beta cells, vascular endothelium, and macrophages<ref name="pmid15356308">{{cite journal | author = Yki-Järvinen H | title = Thiazolidinediones | journal = N. Engl. J. Med. | volume = 351 | issue = 11 | pages = 1106–18 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15356308 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra041001 | url = }}</ref> Rosiglitazone is a selective ligand of PPARγ and has no PPARα-binding action. Other drugs bind to PPARα.

Rosiglitazone also appears to have an anti-[[inflammation|inflammatory]] effect in addition to its effect on [[insulin resistance]]. Nuclear factor kappa-B ([[NF-κB]]), a signaling molecule, stimulates the inflammatory pathways. NF-κB inhibitor (IκB) downregulates the inflammatory pathways. When patients take rosiglitazone, NF-κB levels fall and IκB levels increase.<ref name="pmid15181049">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mohanty P, Aljada A, Ghanim H, Hofmeyer D, Tripathy D, Syed T, Al-Haddad W, Dhindsa S, Dandona P | title = Evidence for a potent antiinflammatory effect of rosiglitazone | journal = J.

In 2012, the U.S. Justice Department announced GlaxoSmithKline had agreed to plead guilty and pay a $3 billion fine, in part for withholding the results of two studies of the cardiovascular safety of Avandia between 2001 and 2007. The settlement stems from claims made by four employees of GlaxoSmithKline, including a former senior marketing development manager for the company and a regional vice president, who tipped off the government about a range of improper practices from the late 1990s to the mid-2000s.<ref name="nytimes.com"/>

====United States investigations====

GlaxoSmithKline was being investigated by the FDA and the US Congress regarding Avandia.

Senators Democrat [[Max Baucus]] and Republican [[Charles Grassley]] filed a report urging GSK to withdraw Avandia in 2008 due to the side effects. The report noted the drug caused 500 avoidable heart attacks a month, and Glaxo officials sought to intimidate doctors who criticized the drug. It also said GSK continued to sell and promote the drug despite knowing the increased risk of heart attacks and stroke.<ref name="urlInteractive: Timeline: The story of Avandia | Need to Know | PBS">{{cite web | url = https://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/health/timeline-history-of-avandia/2314/ | title = Interactive: Timeline: The story of Avandia &#124; Need to Know | publisher = PBS | format = | work = | accessdate = }}</ref>

The [[Senate Finance Committee]], in a panel investigation, revealed emails from GSK company officials that suggest the company downplayed scientific findings about safety risks dating back to 2000. It was also alleged by the committee that the company initiated a "ghostwriting campaign", whereby GSK sought outside companies to write positive articles about Avandia to submit to medical journals.<ref name="urlAvandias Fate May be Sealed Today">{{cite web | url = http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/heavy-doses/2010/07/14/medical-experts-vote-on-whether-to-pull-avandia-from-market#ixzz0tgGHXXRG | title = Avandia's Fate May be Sealed Today | format = | work = | accessdate = }}</ref> GSK defended itself by presenting data that its own tests found Avandia to be safe, although an FDA staff report showed the conclusions were flawed.<ref name="urlAvandia Safety Questioned Again">{{cite web | url = http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/heavy-doses/2010/07/09/avandia-safety-questioned-again-before-a-government-panel-review | title = Avandia Safety Questioned Again | format = | work = | accessdate = }}</ref>

On July 14, 2010, after two days of extensive deliberations, the FDA panel investigating Avandia came to a mixed vote. Twelve members of the panel voted to take the drug off the market, 17 recommended to leave it on but with a more revised warning label, and three voted to keep it on the market with the current warning label.<ref name="url12 panel members recommend Avandia withdrawal - FiercePharma">{{cite web | url = http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/breaking-news-12-panel-members-recommend-avandia-withdrawal/2010-07-14 | title = 12 panel members recommend Avandia withdrawal | publisher = FiercePharma | format = | work = | accessdate = }}</ref><ref name="urlWhat is the meaning of the Avandia vote? - FiercePharma">{{cite web | url = http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/what-does-avandia-vote-mean/2010-07-14 | title = What is the meaning of the Avandia vote? | publisher = FiercePharma | format = | work = | accessdate = }}</ref> The panel has come to some controversy, however; on July 20, 2010, one of the panelists was discovered to have been a paid speaker for GlaxoSmithKline, arousing questions of a conflict of interest.

In 2011 the FDA has decided on revising its prescribing information and medication guides for all rosilitazone containing medicines. The US label for rosiglitazone ([[Avandia]], [[GlaxoSmithKline]]) and all rosiglitazone-containing medications ([[Avandamet]] and [[Avandaryl]]) now include the additional safety information and restrictions.<ref name="pmid22232110">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ross JS, Jackevicius C, Krumholz HM, Ridgeway J, Montori VM, Alexander GC, Zerzan J, Fan J, Shah ND | title = State Medicaid programs did not make use of prior authorization to promote safer prescribing after rosiglitazone warning | journal = Health Aff (Millwood) | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 188–98 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22232110 | pmc = 3319744 | doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.2011.1068 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| author = O'Riordan M | title = New rosiglitazone label includes restrictions on use | url = http://www.theheart.org/article/1182011.do | publisher = theheart.org | accessdate = 1 April 2011 }}</ref> The revised labels restrict use to patients already taking a rosiglitazone-containing medicine or to new patients who are unable to achieve adequate glycemic control on other diabetes medications and to those, who in consultation with their healthcare provider, have decided not to take Actos ([[pioglitazone]]) or other pioglitazone-containing medicines for medical reasons.<ref>{{cite web |title=GSK revises US Avandia label to include new restrictions on use |url=http://www.gsk.com/media/pressreleases/2011/2011_pressrelease_10024.htm |publisher=GlaxoSmithKline |accessdate=1 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217063445/http://www.gsk.com/media/pressreleases/2011/2011_pressrelease_10024.htm |archivedate=17 February 2011 |df= }}</ref>

In June 2013 an FDA Advisory Committee reviewed all available data, including a re-adjudicated RECORD trial, found no evidence of increased cardiovascular risk with Avandia, and voted to remove the restrictions on Avandia marketing in the United States.  In November 2013, the US FDA removed these marketing restrictions on the product.<ref>{{cite web | title = Rosiglitazone-containing Diabetes Medicines: Drug Safety Communication – Removal of Some Prescribing and Dispensing Restrictions | url = http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm376683.htm?source=govdelivery | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration }}</ref> Under the FDA’s instruction, Avandia’s maker, GlaxoSmithKline, had funded the Duke Clinical Research Institute to re-analyze the raw data from the study. At the 2010 panel, three panelists voted that the existing warnings were good enough; two were back in 2013. Seven voted to make those warnings more onerous, and five of them returned. But of the 10 who voted to restrict Avandia’s use, only four returned. And of the 12 who voted in 2010 to withdraw Avandia from the market, only three came back.<ref>{{cite news|last=Herper|first=Matthew|title=Avandia Vote Ends An Era Of Drug Safety Scandals|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2013/06/06/what-the-fdas-avandia-decision-means-for-the-future/|accessdate=31 March 2014|newspaper=Forbes|date=2013-06-06}}</ref>

====European investigations====
In 2000 a  study to address the concerns regarding cardiovascular safety was requested by the EMA, and the makers agreed to perform post-marketing a long-term cardiovascular morbidity/mortality study in patients on rosiglitazone in combination with a sulfonylurea or metformin: the RECORD study. The results as published in 2009 showed non-inferiority with regard to cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death when the treatment with rosiglitazone was compared with metformin or a sulfonylurea. For myocardial infarction, there was a non-statistically significant increase in risk. In their assessment, the European regulators acknowledged weaknesses of the study, such as an unexpectedly low rate of cardiovascular events and the open-label design, which may lead to reporting bias. They found that the results were inconclusive.<ref name=pmid21153629 /> The European Medicines Agency recommended on 23 September 2010 that Avandia be suspended from the European market.<ref name="ema_recommend_suspend"/><ref name="bbc_ema_suspension"/>

According to a probe by the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' in September 2010, the United Kingdom's Commission on Human Medicines recommended to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) back in July 2010, to withdraw Avandia sale because its "risks outweigh its benefits". Additionally, the probe revealed that in 2000, members of the European panel in charge of reviewing Avandia prior to its approval had concerns about the long-term risks of the drug.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703713504575475884140520538?mod=googlenews_wsj | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=U.K. Medical Journal Questions Avandia License | first=Jason | last=Douglas | date=2010-09-06}}</ref><ref name="urlU.K. watchdogs vote for Avandia withdrawal – FiercePharma">{{cite web | url = http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/u-k-watchdogs-vote-avandia-withdrawal/2010-09-07 | title = U.K. watchdogs vote for Avandia withdrawal | publisher = FiercePharma | format = | work = | accessdate = }}</ref>

===Controversy and response===
Following the reports in 2007 that Avandia can significantly increase the risk of heart attacks, the drug has been controversial. A 2010 article in ''Time'' uses the Avandia case as evidence of a broken FDA regulatory system that "may prove criminal as well as fatal". It details the disclosure failures, adding, "Congressional reports revealed that GSK sat on early evidence of the heart risks of its drug, and that the FDA knew of the dangers months before it informed the public." It reports, "the FDA is investigating whether GSK broke the law by failing to fully inform the agency of Avandia's heart risks", according to deputy FDA commissioner Dr. Joshua Sharfstein. GSK threatened academics who reported adverse research results, and received multiple warning letters from the FDA for deceptive marketing and failure to report clinical data.<ref name="urlTIME">{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2010028,00.html | title = After Avandia: Does the FDA Have a Drug Problem? | date = Aug 12, 2010 | work = Time| accessdate = }}</ref> The maker of the drug, GlaxoSmithKline, has dealt with serious backlash against the company for the drug's controversy.<ref name="urlWill Avandia Be Yanked Off the Market? - US News">{{cite web | url = http://health.usnews.com/health-news/managing-your-healthcare/diabetes/articles/2010/07/09/will-avandia-be-yanked-off-the-market.html | title = Will Avandia Be Yanked Off the Market? | publisher = US News | work = | accessdate = }}</ref> Sales on the drug dropped significantly after the story first broke in 2007, dropping from $2.5 billion in 2006 to less than $408 million in 2009 in the US.<ref name="urlExclusive: Takeda launches Actos DTC campaign today – Medical Marketing and Media">{{cite web | url = http://www.mmm-online.com/exclusive-takeda-launches-actos-dtc-campaign-today/article/174652/ | title = Exclusive: Takeda launches Actos DTC campaign today | publisher = Medical Marketing and Media | format = | work = | accessdate = }}</ref>

Three doctors' groups, the [[Endocrine Society]], the [[American Diabetes Association]] and the [[American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists]], urged patients to continue to take the drug as it would be much worse to stop all treatment, despite any associated risk, but that patients could consult their doctors and begin a switch to a different drug if they or their doctors find concern.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1521260120100715 | work=Reuters | title=Don't dump Avandia, diabetes groups urge patients | date=2010-07-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/15/news/la-heb-avandia-20100715 | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Patients taking Avandia should keep on doing so, doctor groups say | first=Thomas H. | last=Maugh II | date=2010-07-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-20010767-10391704.html | work=CBS News | title=Avandia News: What You Need to Know | first=Neil | last=Katz | date=2010-07-16}}</ref> The [[American Heart Association]] said in a statement in June 2010: " ...the reports deserves serious consideration, and patients with diabetes who are 65 years of age or older and being treated with rosiglitazone should discuss the findings with their prescribing physician....".

Rosiglitazone was thought to be able to benefit patients with [[Alzheimer's disease]] who do not express the [[Apolipoprotein E|ApoE4]] [[allele]],<ref name="pmid16446752">{{cite journal |vauthors=Risner ME, Saunders AM, Altman JF, Ormandy GC, Craft S, Foley IM, Zvartau-Hind ME, Hosford DA, Roses AD | title = Efficacy of rosiglitazone in a genetically defined population with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease | journal = Pharmacogenomics J. | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 246–54 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16446752 | doi = 10.1038/sj.tpj.6500369 }}</ref> but the phase III trial designed to test this showed that rosiglitazone was ineffective in all patients, including [[Apolipoprotein E|ApoE4]]-negative patients.<ref name="pmid20733306">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gold M, Alderton C, Zvartau-Hind M, Egginton S, Saunders AM, Irizarry M, Craft S, Landreth G, Linnamägi U, Sawchak S | title = Rosiglitazone monotherapy in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease: results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study | journal = Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 131–46 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20733306 | pmc = 3214882 | doi = 10.1159/000318845 }}</ref>

Rosiglitazone may also treat mild to moderate [[ulcerative colitis]], due to its anti-inflammatory properties as a PPAR ligand.<ref name="pmid18471502">{{cite journal | author = Lewis JD | title = Will 2008 mark the start of a new clinical trial era in gastroenterology? | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 134 | issue = 5 | pages = 1289 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18471502 | doi = 10.1053/j.gastro.2008.03.030 }}</ref>
