'''Tinidazole''' is an anti-parasitic [[Medication|drug]] used against [[protozoan]] infections. It is widely known throughout Europe and the developing world as a treatment for a variety of amoebic and parasitic infections. It was developed in 1972.  A derivative of [[2-Methylimidazole|2-methylimidazole]], it is a prominent member of the [[nitroimidazole]] antibiotics.<ref name=Ebel>Ebel, K., Koehler, H., Gamer, A. O., & Jäckh, R. “Imidazole and Derivatives.” In Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry; 2002 Wiley-VCH, {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a13_661}}</ref>

Tinidazole is marketed by Mission Pharmacal under the brand name '''Tindamax''', by [[Pfizer]] under the names '''Fasigyn''' and '''Simplotan''', and in some Asian countries as '''Sporinex'''.

==Uses==
A large body of clinical data exists to support use of tinidazole for infections from amoebae, giardia, and trichomonas, just like metronidazole. Tinidazole may be a therapeutic alternative in the setting of metronidazole tolerance.  Tinidazole may also be used to treat a variety of other bacterial infections (e.g., as part of combination therapy for [[Helicobacter pylori eradication protocols]]).<ref> Edwards, David I. "Nitroimidazole drugs - action and resistance mechanisms. I. Mechanism of action" Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy 1993, volume 31, pp. 9-20. {{doi|10.1093/jac/31.1.9}}.</ref>

== Side effects ==
Drinking alcohol while taking tinidazole causes an unpleasant disulfiram-like reaction, which includes nausea, vomiting, headache, increased blood pressure, flushing, and shortness of breath.

== Half-life ==
Elimination half-life is 13.2 ± 1.4 hours. Plasma half-life is 12 to 14 hours.
