==Medical uses==

===Anesthesia===
Propofol is used for induction and maintenance (in some cases) of anesthesia, having largely replaced [[sodium thiopental]].<ref name=cpaedpap/> It can also be administered as part of an anaesthesia maintenance technique called total intravenous anesthesia using either manually-programmed infusion pumps or computer-controlled infusion pumps in a process called target controlled infusion or TCI. Propofol is also used to sedate individuals who are receiving mechanical ventilation but are not undergoing surgery, such as patients in the [[intensive care unit]]. In critically ill patients, propofol has been found to be superior to [[lorazepam]] both in effectiveness and overall cost.<ref name="Cox-2008">{{Cite journal | last1 = Cox | first1 = CE. | last2 = Reed | first2 = SD. | last3 = Govert | first3 = JA. | last4 = Rodgers | first4 = JE. | last5 = Campbell-Bright | first5 = S. | last6 = Kress | first6 = JP. | last7 = Carson | first7 = SS. | title = Economic evaluation of propofol and lorazepam for critically ill patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. | journal = Crit Care Med | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 706–14 |date=March 2008 | doi = 10.1097/CCM.0B013E3181544248 | pmid = 18176312 | pmc = 2763279 }}</ref>

Propofol is often used instead of sodium thiopental for starting anesthesia because recovery from propofol is more rapid and "clear."

===Procedural sedation===
Propofol is also used for procedural sedation. Its use in these settings results in a faster recovery compared to [[midazolam]].<ref name="McQuaid-2008">{{Cite journal | last1 = McQuaid | first1 = KR. | last2 = Laine | first2 = L. | title = A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials of moderate sedation for routine endoscopic procedures. | journal = Gastrointest Endosc | volume = 67 | issue = 6 | pages = 910–23 |date=May 2008 | doi = 10.1016/j.gie.2007.12.046 | pmid = 18440381 }}</ref> It can also be combined with [[opioids]] or [[benzodiazepines]].<ref>Canadian National Forumulary 2010</ref><ref>Appleton & Lange Nursing Drug Guide, 1999</ref><ref>Numorphan® (oxymorphone) package insert (English), Endo 2009</ref> Because of its fast induction and recovery time, propofol is also widely used for sedation of infants and children undergoing [[MRI]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Machata|first=AM|author2=Willschke, H|author3=Kabon, B|author4=Kettner, SC|author5=Marhofer, P|title=Propofol-based sedation regimen for infants and children undergoing ambulatory magnetic resonance imaging.|journal=British journal of anaesthesia|date=August 2008|volume=101|issue=2|pages=239–43|pmid=18534971|url=http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/content/101/2/239.full|doi=10.1093/bja/aen153|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019001054/http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/content/101/2/239.full|archivedate=19 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It is also often used in combination with [[ketamine]] as the two together have lower rates of side effects.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Yan|first1=JW|last2=McLeod|first2=SL|last3=Iansavitchene|first3=A|title=Ketamine-Propofol Versus Propofol Alone for Procedural Sedation in the Emergency Department: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.|journal=Academic Emergency Medicine|date=20 August 2015|pmid=26292077|doi=10.1111/acem.12737|volume=22|pages=1003–13}}</ref>

==Other uses==

===Executions===

==Side effects==
One of propofol's most frequent side effects is pain on injection, especially in smaller veins. This pain arises from activation of the pain receptor, [[TRPA1]],<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/105/25/8784.long |title=General anesthetics activate a nociceptive ion channel to enhance pain and inflammation |accessdate=8 June 2013 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0711038105 |volume=105 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |pages=8784–8789 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924145703/http://www.pnas.org/content/105/25/8784.long |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> found on sensory nerves and can be mitigated by pretreatment with [[lidocaine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/MMX/Propofol.html|title=Propofol Drug Information, Professional|publisher=m drugs.com|accessdate=2 January 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070123141308/http://www.drugs.com/MMX/Propofol.html|archivedate=23 January 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Less pain is experienced when infused at a slower rate in a large vein (antecubital fossa). Patients show great variability in their response to propofol, at times showing profound sedation with small doses.

As a respiratory depressant, propofol frequently produces apnea. The persistence of apnea can depend on factors such as premedication, dose administered, and rate of administration, and may sometimes persist for longer than 60 seconds.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Langley | first1 = M | last2 = Heel | first2 = R | year = 1988 | title = Propofol.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Propofol is highly protein-bound ''in vivo'' and is metabolised by [[Xenobiotic conjugation|conjugation]] in the liver.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Favetta P, Degoute CS, Perdrix JP, Dufresne C, Boulieu R, Guitton J | year = 2002 | title = Propofol metabolites in man following propofol induction and maintenance | url = | journal = British Journal of Anaesthesia | volume = 88 | issue = 5| pages = 653–8 | doi=10.1093/bja/88.5.653}}</ref>
The [[Biological half-life|half-life of elimination]] of propofol has been estimated to be between 2 and 24 hours. However, its duration of clinical effect is much shorter, because propofol is rapidly distributed into peripheral tissues. When used for IV sedation, a single dose of propofol typically wears off within minutes. Propofol is versatile; the drug can be given for short or prolonged sedation, as well as for general anesthesia. Its use is not associated with nausea as is often seen with opioid medications. These characteristics of rapid onset and recovery along with its [[amnestic]] effects<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 9357875 | volume=87 | issue=4 | title=The comparative amnestic effects of midazolam, propofol, thiopental, and fentanyl at equisedative concentrations |date=October 1997 | journal=Anesthesiology | pages=749–64 |vauthors=Veselis RA, Reinsel RA, Feshchenko VA, Wroński M | doi=10.1097/00000542-199710000-00007}}</ref> have led to its widespread use for sedation and anesthesia.

==Chemistry==
[[Image:Propofol.jpg|thumb|A 20-ml ampoule of 1% propofol emulsion, as sold in Australia by [[Sandoz]]|alt=Large vial filled with milky white fluid]]
Propofol was originally developed in the UK by [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] as ICI 35868. Clinical trials followed in 1977, using a form solubilised in [[cremophor EL]]. However, due to [[Anaphylaxis|anaphylactic reactions]] to cremophor, this formulation was withdrawn from the market and subsequently reformulated as an [[emulsion]] of a soya oil/propofol mixture in water. The emulsified formulation was relaunched in 1986 by ICI (now [[AstraZeneca]]) under the brand name Diprivan.  The currently available preparation is 1% propofol, 10% [[soybean oil]], and 1.2% purified [[Egg lecithin|egg phospholipid]] as an emulsifier, with 2.25%  [[glycerol]] as a [[tonicity]]-adjusting agent, and [[sodium hydroxide]] to adjust the pH. Diprivan contains EDTA, a common chelation agent, that also acts alone (bacteriostatically against some bacteria) and synergistically with some other antimicrobial agents. Newer generic formulations contain [[sodium metabisulfite]] or [[benzyl alcohol]] as antimicrobial agents. Propofol emulsion is a highly opaque white fluid due to the scattering of light from the tiny (about 150-nm) oil droplets it contains.

A water-soluble [[prodrug]] form, [[fospropofol]], has recently been developed and tested with positive results. Fospropofol is rapidly broken down by the enzyme [[alkaline phosphatase]] to form propofol. Marketed as Lusedra, this new formulation may not produce the pain at injection site that often occurs with the traditional form of the drug. The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|US Food and Drug Administration]] approved the product in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.DrugDetails |title=Drugs@FDA: FDA Approved Drug Products |publisher=Accessdata.fda.gov |accessdate=8 June 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SN0rqosx?url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.DrugDetails |archivedate=5 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
