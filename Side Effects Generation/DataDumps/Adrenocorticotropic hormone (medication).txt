== Medical uses ==
Both corticotropin and tetracosactide have been used for diagnostic purposes to determine adrenocortical insufficiency, particularly in [[Addison's disease]], via the [[ACTH stimulation test]].<ref name=Gettig2009rev/><ref name=USlabelCosyntropin/><ref name=UKSynacthenDiagnostic/> However, as of 2015 the US label for corticotropin does not include diagnostic use.<ref name=USlabelCorticotropin/>

Both corticotropin and tetracosactide have been used for therapeutic purposes.<ref name=USlabelCorticotropin/><ref name=UKSynacthenTherapeutic/> In the US the tetracosactide label is limited to diagnosis<ref name=Gettig2009rev/><ref name=USlabelCosyntropin/> but the UK label provides for therapeutic uses.<ref name=UKSynacthenTherapeutic/>

In the US corticotropin is used to treat [[epileptic spasms]] in infants, acute exacerbations of [[multiple sclerosis]] in adults; acute episodes of [[psoriatic arthritis]] and [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[ankylosing spondylitis]]; in acute exacerbations or as maintenance therapy for the collagen disorders like [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] and systemic [[dermatomyositis]]; for skin conditions like severe [[erythema multiforme]] and [[Stevens-Johnson syndrome]]; for [[serum sickness]]; for severe acute and chronic allergic and inflammatory processes involving the eye such as [[keratitis]], [[iritis]], [[iridocyclitis]], diffuse posterior [[uveitis]], [[choroiditis]], [[optic neuritis]], [[chorioretinitis]], and anterior segment inflammation;  [[sarcoidosis]] in the lungs; and to treat [[edema]] in certain [[nephrotic syndrome]]s.<ref name=USlabelCorticotropin/>

In the UK tetracosactide is used for short-term therapy in conditions for which [[glucocorticoids]] are usually used but for some reason should not be; some uses include use for people who don't respond to glucocorticoids or cannot tolerate them who have [[ulcerative colitis]], [[Crohn's disease]], [[juvenile rheumatoid arthritis]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], or [[osteoarthrosis]].<ref name=UKSynacthenTherapeutic/>

== Contraindications ==
In the US the only contraindication for tetracosactide for diagnostic use is hypersensitivity to ADCH<ref name=USlabelCosyntropin/> but in the UK, regulators placed contraindications for hypersensitivity to ADCH and additionally, for people with allergic disorders including asthma, acute psychosis, infectious diseases, peptic ulcer, refractory heart failure, [[Cushing's syndrome]], treatment of primary adrenocortical insufficiency and adrenocongenital syndrome.<ref name=UKSynacthenDiagnostic/>

The same contraindications that were applied in the UK for diagnostic use of tetracosactide, apply for therapeutic use of both tetracosactide and corticotropin in the US and UK.<ref name=USlabelCorticotropin/><ref name=UKSynacthenTherapeutic/>

In addition, the US label for corticotropin for therapeutic uses includes contraindications for people who have recently had surgery, and people with scleroderma, osteoporosis, uncontrolled hypertension, or sensitivity to proteins of porcine origin; in addition the infection diseases systemic fungal infection, ocular herpes simplex, and infants who have congenital infections are specified.  The label also notes that people taking corticotropin for immunosuppression should not be given live vaccines.<ref name=USlabelCorticotropin/>

== Adverse effects ==
People taking corticotropin or tetracosactide are more likely to get infections, and are at risk of hypothalamic-pituitary-axis (HPA) suppression and [[Cushing's syndrome]].<ref name=USlabelCorticotropin/><ref name=UKSynacthenTherapeutic/>

== Pharmacology ==
In the normal situation, ACTH is released from the [[pituitary gland]] at the base of the brain. It acts on the adrenal glands to stimulate the production of steroid hormones ([[glucocorticoid]]s). If the adrenal glands are healthy, a single injection of tetracosactide results in a rise in blood [[cortisol]] (hydrocortisone) concentrations in 30 minutes. If the adrenal glands appear not to be working then tetracosactide injection can be given to check whether the problem is due to diseased or damaged adrenals or due to lack of pituitary ACTH.

Tetracosactide stimulates the release of [[corticosteroid]]s such as [[cortisol]] from the [[adrenal gland]]s, and is used for the [[ACTH stimulation test]] to assess [[adrenal gland]] function.<ref name="MortonHall2012" />{{rp|271}}

== Chemistry ==
The synthetic form consists of the first 24 (of a total of 39) [[amino acid]]s of ACTH and retains full function of the parent peptide.<ref name="Elks2014"/>{{rp|1165}}

===Pricing===
Mallinckrodt acquired the rights to the animal-derived form via its acquisition of Questcor Pharmaceuticals in 2014.<ref name=WaPo2017/>  When Questcor acquired the drug in 2001 it sold for $40 a vial; within a year of the acquisition Questcor raised the price of the drug to $1,500 per vial and to $28,000 by 2013.<ref name=NYTprice2012>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/30/business/questcor-finds-profit-for-acthar-drug-at-28000-a-vial.html | title = Questcor Finds Profits, at $28,000 a Vial | author = Pollack A  | date = 2012-12-29 | work = | publisher = New York Times }}</ref><ref name=FierceSuit>{{cite news|last1=Staton|first1=Tracy|title=Questcor's Acthar maneuvers land Mallinckrodt in hot water with FTC, state AGs|url=http://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/questcor-s-acthar-maneuvers-land-mallinckrodt-hot-water-ftc-state-ags|work=FiercePharma|date=June 18, 2015|language=en}}</ref>  In 2013, Questcor acquired the US rights to a competing product, Synacthen Depot, from Novartis.<ref name=FierceSuit/>  In 2014 Mallinckrodt raised the price of Acthar further to $34,000.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pharma corp. hikes infant epilepsy drug price by 2,000%, from $33.05 per vial to $680 per vial |url=http://www.zmescience.com/medicine/infant-epilepsy-drug-hike-04234/ |accessdate=16 November 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Galeon|first1=Dom|title=Company Raises the Price of a Drug That Fights Infant Epilepsy by 85,000%|url=https://futurism.com/company-raises-the-price-of-a-drug-that-fights-infant-epilepsy-by-85000/|work=Futurism|date=21 January 2017}}</ref>  The [[Federal Trade Commission]] and attorneys general from five states sued Mallinckrodt for anti-competitive behavior with regard to the acquisition of Synacthen Depot and the monopolistic pricing of Acthar, and in January 2017 the company settled, agreeing to pay $100 million and to license Synacthen Depot to a competitor.<ref name=WaPo2017>{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Carolyn Y.|title=Maker of $34,000-a-vial drug to pay $100 million for allegedly preventing competition|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/01/18/maker-of-34000-a-vial-drug-to-pay-100-million-for-allegedly-preventing-competition/|work=Washington Post|date=January 18, 2017}}</ref> According to Kaiser Health News, Mallinckrodt responded by increasing its Congressional lobbying to $610,000, and its contributions to Congress members to $44,000, in the first quarter of 2017. <ref>[http://khn.org/news/follow-the-money-drugmakers-deploy-political-cash-as-prices-and-anger-mount/ Follow The Money: Drugmakers Deploy Political Cash As Prices And Anger Mount], By Jay Hancock and Elizabeth Lucas and Sydney Lupkin, Kaiser Health News, July 24, 2017</ref>

In Canada, Synacthen Depot's pricing increased by 2000% in 2015, causing some provincial single payer authorities to delist the drug from funded medications. The increase in the drug's price came after [[Mallinckrodt]] acquired Questcor and its drug portfolio, which included the worldwide rights to Synacthen Depot. Prior to the price increase,  Mallinckrodt claims that the drug was manufactured at a loss. Some have claimed that the price increase is abusive.<ref name=CBC-2015-11-16>{{cite news |url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/infantile-seizures-drug-1.3318183 |title= 2,000% price hike for infant seizure drug called 'absurd' |author= Kelly Crowe |publisher= CBC News |date= 16 November 2015 }}</ref> The drug had been priced at $33 but rose to $680 per vial.
