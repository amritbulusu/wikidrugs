It is in the [[phenethylamine]] and [[piperidine]] classes of medications. It is the active [[dextrorotatory]] [[enantiomer]] of [[methylphenidate]].

==Medical uses==
Dexmethylphenidate is used as a treatment for [[ADHD]], usually along with psychological, educational, behavioral or other forms of treatment. It is proposed that stimulants help ameliorate the symptoms of ADHD by making it easier for the user to concentrate, avoid distraction, and control behavior. Placebo-controlled trials have shown that once-daily dexmethylphenidate XR was effective and generally well tolerated.<ref name="dexmethyl">Moen M, Keam S.[http://adisonline.com/cnsdrugs/abstract/2009/23120/Dexmethylphenidate_Extended_Release__A_Review_of.7.aspx Dexmethylphenidate Extended Release: A Review of its Use in the Treatment of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder].

Although four [[stereoisomers]] of [[methylphenidate]] (MPH) are possible, only the [[threo]] [[diastereoisomers]] are used in modern practice. There is a high [[eudysmic ratio]] between the SS and RR [[enantiomers]] of MPH. Dexmethylphenidate (d-threo-methylphenidate) is a preparation of the RR enantiomer of methylphenidate.<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 9181638 | year = 1997 | last1 = Ding | first1 = Y.
