'''Tracazolate''' ('''ICI-136,753''') is an [[anxiolytic]] [[drug]] which is used in scientific research. It is a [[pyrazolopyridine]] [[chemical derivative|derivative]], most closely related to [[pyrazolopyrimidine]] drugs such as [[zaleplon]], and is one of a structurally diverse group of drugs known as the [[nonbenzodiazepine]]s which act at the same receptor targets as [[benzodiazepine]]s but have distinct chemical structures.<ref>Patel JB, Malick JB, Salama AI, Goldberg ME. Pharmacology of pyrazolopyridines. ''Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behaviour''. 1985 Oct;23(4):675-80. {{PMID|2866547}}</ref> 

Tracazolate has primarily [[anxiolytic]] and [[anticonvulsant]] effects, with [[sedative]] and [[muscle relaxant]] effects only appearing at higher doses.<ref>Patel JB, Malick JB. Pharmacological properties of tracazolate: a new non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic agent. ''European Journal of Pharmacology''. 1982 Mar 12;78(3):323-33. {{PMID|6121711}}</ref> It has a unique receptor binding profile involving allosteric modulation of several [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub>]] receptor subtypes, being selective for GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors containing α1 and β3 subunits, but exhibiting different effects depending on the third type of subunit making up the receptor complex.<ref>Thompson SA, Wingrove PB, Connelly L, Whiting PJ, Wafford KA. Tracazolate reveals a novel type of allosteric interaction with recombinant gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) receptors. ''Molecular Pharmacology''. 2002 Apr;61(4):861-9. {{PMID|11901225}}</ref>
