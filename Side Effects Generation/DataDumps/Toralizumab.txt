'''Toralizumab''' ('''IDEC 131''') was a [[humanized monoclonal antibody]] and an [[immunosuppressive drug]]. Possible indications included treatment of antibody-mediated disorders ([[immune thrombocytopenic purpura]], [[lupus nephritis]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]]), T-cell-mediated diseases ([[multiple sclerosis]], [[Crohn's disease]], and [[Organ transplantation|transplantation]]s such as solid organ transplantation, pancreatic [[islet cell]] transplantation, and [[cornea]]l transplantation), and B-cell malignancies such as [[Chronic lymphocytic leukemia|CLL]]/[[small lymphocytic lymphoma]], [[follicular cell]] lymphoma grade I or II, [[marginal zone lymphoma]], [[mantle cell lymphoma]], [[MALT lymphoma]], [[Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia]], monocytoid [[B-cell lymphoma]]; relapsed/refractory [[Hodgkin's disease]]).<ref>[http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/365/toralizumab.doc Statement On A Nonproprietary Name Adopted By The USAN Council - Toralizumab], ''American Medical Association''.</ref>

In Phase II [[clinical trial]]s regarding multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease, [[thromboembolism]]s occurred in at least three patients. A causal connection could not be proven, but since the same adverse effects were seen in trials with a similar antibody (hu5C8), the trials were halted.<ref>{{cite book|last=Luebke|first=Robert W|author2=Robert V House |author3=Ian Kimber |title=Immunotoxicology and immunopharmacology|publisher=CRC Press, Taylor & Francis Group|location=Boca Raton, Florida|year=2007|edition=3|series=Target Organ Toxicology Series|page=131|isbn=0-8493-3790-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L7G38ea2wnAC&pg=PA131&lpg=PA131&dq=Toralizumab&source=bl&ots=I1JzPC9JrI&sig=BtBvqUADmWpI0SS1wmlW2h7Dajg&hl=de&ei=mUPwSsy_I4jt-Abo3rzqBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CC8Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=Toralizumab&f=false}}</ref>
