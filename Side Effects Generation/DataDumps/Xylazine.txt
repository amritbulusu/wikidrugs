Xylazine was approved by the FDA for veterinary use and is now used as an animal [[tranquilizer]].<ref name=Reyes /> In the United States, xylazine was only approved by the FDA for veterinary use as a sedative, analgesic, and muscle relaxant in dogs, cats, horses, elk, [[fallow deer]], [[mule deer]], [[sika deer]], and [[white-tailed deer]].<ref name=Greene /><ref name=Ruiz! /> The sedative and analgesic effects of xylazine are related to central nervous system depression. Xylazine’s muscle relaxant effect inhibits the transmission of neural impulses in the central nervous system.<ref name=Delehant>{{cite journal|last1=Delehant|first1=TM|last2=Denhart|first2=JW|last3=Lloyd|first3=WE|last4=Powell|first4=JD|title=Pharmacokinetics of xylazine, 2,6-dimethylaniline, and tolazoline in tissues from yearling cattle and milk from mature dairy cows after sedation with xylazine hydrochloride and reversal with tolazoline hydrochloride.|journal=Veterinary Therapeutics |date=2003|volume=4|issue=2|pages=128–34|pmid=14506588}}</ref>

In scientific research, xylazine is a component of the most common anesthetic, ketamine-xylazine, which is used in rats, mice, hamster, and guinea pigs.<ref name=Veilleux-Lemieux>{{cite journal|last1=Veilleux-Lemieux|first1=D|last2=Castel|first2=A|last3=Carrier|first3=D|last4=Beaudry|first4=F|last5=Vachon|first5=P|title=Pharmacokinetics of ketamine and xylazine in young and old Sprague-Dawley rats.|journal=Journal of the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science |date=September 2013|volume=52|issue=5|pages=567–70|pmid=24041212|pmc=3784662}}</ref> The accounts of the actions and uses of xylazine in animals were reported as early as the late 1960s and early 1970s.<ref name=Greene /> Since the early 2000s, xylazine has become popular as a drug of abuse in the United States and Puerto Rico.<ref name=Meyer>{{cite journal|last1=Meyer|first1=GM|last2=Maurer|first2=HH|title=Qualitative metabolism assessment and toxicological detection of xylazine, a veterinary tranquilizer and drug of abuse, in rat and human urine using GC-MS, LC-MSn, and LC-HR-MSn.|journal=Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry|date=December 2013|volume=405|issue=30|pages=9779–89|pmid=24141317|doi=10.1007/s00216-013-7419-7}}</ref> Xylazine’s street name in Puerto Rico is ''Anestesia de Caballo'', which roughly translates to “horse anesthetic."<ref name=Ruiz! /><ref name=Torruella>{{cite journal|last1=Torruella|first1=RA|title=Xylazine (veterinary sedative) use in Puerto Rico.|journal=Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy|date=11 April 2011|volume=6|pages=7|pmid=21481268|doi=10.1186/1747-597x-6-7|pmc=3080818}}</ref> The reasons that may explain why this drug has become increasingly popular are still unknown.<ref name=Torruella /> Further research is needed to gain more information on the distribution of xylazine in the body, physical symptoms, potential treatments, and predictive factors for chronic usage.<ref name=Torruella/>

==Medical uses==

Xylazine is often used as a sedative, muscle relaxant, and analgesic.<ref name=Greene /> It is frequently used in the treatment of [[tetanus]].<ref name=Greene /> Xylazine is very similar to drugs such as [[phenothiazine]], tricyclic antidepressants, and clonidine.<ref name=Ruiz! /> As an anesthetic, it is typically used in conjunction with ketamine.<ref name=Xiao /> Xylazine appears to reduce sensitivity to [[insulin]] and [[glucose]] uptake in humans.<ref name=Xiao /> [[Yohimbine]] has been used to decrease glucose levels to a healthy level.<ref name=Xiao /> In clinical settings, Yohimbine can reverse the adverse effects of xylazine if administered intravenously at a dosage of 0.5 mL / 20 pounds shortly after xylazine administration.<ref name=Torruella />

==Pharmacodynamics==

[[File:Xylazine Synthesis.png|thumb|Xylazine Synthesis adapted from Elliot et al., 1986.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Elliott|title=Process for the Production of Xylazine|journal=United States Patent|date=30 September 1986|display-authors=etal}}</ref>
]]

Xylazine is a potent α2 [[adrenergic agonist]].<ref name=Ruiz! /> When xylazine and other α2 adrenergic receptor agonists are administered, they distribute throughout the body within 30 to 40 minutes.<ref name=Delehant /> Due to xylazine’s highly [[lipophilic]] nature, xylazine directly stimulates central α2 receptors as well as peripheral α-adrenoceptors in a variety of tissues.<ref name=Greene /><ref name=Ruiz! /> As an agonist, xylazine leads to a decrease in neurotransmission of [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]] in the central nervous system.<ref name=Ruiz! /> It does so by mimicking norepinephrine in binding to presynaptic surface [[autoreceptor]]s, which leads to feedback inhibition of norepinephrine.<ref name=Park>{{cite journal|last1=Park|first1=JW|last2=Chung|first2=HW|last3=Lee|first3=EJ|last4=Jung|first4=KH|last5=Paik|first5=JY|last6=Lee|first6=KH|title=α2-Adrenergic agonists including xylazine and dexmedetomidine inhibit norepinephrine transporter function in SK-N-SH cells.|journal=Neuroscience Letters|date=29 April 2013|volume=541|pages=184–9|pmid=23485735|doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2013.02.022}}</ref>

Research has found that xylazine significantly increases [[Lineweaver–Burk plot|Km]] and does not affect [[Lineweaver–Burk plot|Vmax]].<ref name=Park /> Xylazine also serves as a transport inhibitor by suppressing norepinephrine transport function through [[competitive inhibition]] of substrate transport. This likely occurs by direct interaction on an area that overlaps with the antidepressant binding site.<ref name=Park /> For example, xylazine and clonidine suppress uptake of MIBG, a norepinephrine analog, in [[neuroblastoma]] cells.<ref name=Park /> Xylazine has varying affinities for [[cholinergic]], [[serotonergic]], [[dopaminergic]], [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α1 adrenergic]], [[Histamine H2 receptor|H2 - histaminergic]] and [[opiate]] receptors.<ref name=Ruiz! /> Its chemical structure closely resembles the [[phenothiazines]], [[tricyclic antidepressants]], and clonidine.

==Pharmacokinetics==

Xylazine is absorbed, metabolized, and eliminated rapidly. Xylazine can be inhaled or administered intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, or orally either by itself or in conjunction with other anesthetics, such as ketamine, [[barbiturates]], [[chloral hydrate]], and [[halothane]] in order to provide reliable anesthesia effects.<ref name=Reyes /><ref name=Xiao /> The most common route of administration is [[injection (medicine)|injection]].<ref name=Reyes /> The drug is used as a veterinary anesthetic and the recommended dose varies between species.<ref name=Silva-Torres>{{cite journal|last1=Silva-Torres|first1=L|last2=Veléz|first2=C|last3=Alvarez|first3=L|last4=Zayas|first4=B|title=Xylazine as a drug of abuse and its effects on the generation of reactive species and DNA damage on human umbilical vein endothelial cells.|journal=Journal of Toxicology|date=2014|volume=2014|pages=492609|pmid=25435874|doi=10.1155/2014/492609|pmc=4243599}}</ref>

If it is administered [[intramuscularly]], the recommended dose is 0.25 – 4&nbsp;mg per pound in animals.<ref name=Ruiz! /> If xylazine is administered [[intravenously]], the recommended dose is 0.5&nbsp;mg per pound in animals.<ref name=Ruiz! /> As a veterinary anesthetic, xylazine is typically only administered once for intended effect before or during surgical procedures.<ref name=Greene /> When used as a drug of abuse in humans, the frequency of dosage is dependent on social or economic factors as well as each user’s subjective response to xylazine’s [[addictive]] properties.<ref name=Greene />

Xylazine’s action can be seen usually 15 to 30 minutes after administration and the sedative effect may continue for 1–2 hours and last up to 4 hours.<ref name=Ruiz! /> Once xylazine gains access to the vascular system, it is distributed within the blood, allowing xylazine to perfuse target organs including the heart, lungs, liver, and kidney.<ref name=Silva-Torres /> In nonfatal cases, the blood plasma concentrations range from 0.03 to 4.6&nbsp;mg/L.<ref name=Ruiz! /> Xylazine diffuses extensively and penetrates the blood brain barrier, as expected due to the uncharged, lipophilic nature of the compound.<ref name=Ruiz! />

In dogs, sheep, horses and cattle, the half life is very short at only 1.21 to 5.97 minutes. Complete elimination of the [[half lives]] can take up to 23.11 minutes in sheep and up to 49.51 minutes in horses.<ref name=Greene /><ref name=Ruiz! /> In young rats, the half life is an hour.<ref name=Veilleux-Lemieux /> Xylazine has a large [[volume of distribution]] (Vd).<ref name=Ruiz! /> The Vd is 1.9-2.5 for horse, cattle, sheep, and dog.<ref name=Ruiz! /> Though the peak [[Blood plasma|plasma]] concentrations are reached in 12–14 minutes in all species, the [[bioavailability]] varies between species.<ref name=Ruiz! /> The half life depends on the age of the animal, as age is related to prolonged duration of anesthesia and recovery time.<ref name=Veilleux-Lemieux /> Toxicity occurs with repeated administration, given that the metabolic clearance of the drug is usually calculated as 7 to 9 times the half-life, which is 4 to 5 days for the clearance of xylazine.<ref name=Veilleux-Lemieux />

Xylazine is metabolized by liver [[cytochrome P450]] enzymes.<ref name=Veilleux-Lemieux /> When it reaches the liver, xylazine is metabolized and proceeds to the kidneys to be excreted as urine.<ref name=Barroso>{{cite journal|last1=Barroso|first1=M|last2=Gallardo|first2=E|last3=Margalho|first3=C|last4=Devesa|first4=N|last5=Pimentel|first5=J|last6=Vieira|first6=DN|title=Solid-phase extraction and gas chromatographic- mass spectrometric determination of the veterinary drug xylazine in human blood.|journal=Journal of Analytical Toxicology|date=April 2007|volume=31|issue=3|pages=165–9|pmid=17579964|doi=10.1093/jat/31.3.165}}</ref> Around 70% of a dose is excreted by urine.<ref name=Veilleux-Lemieux /> Thus, urine can be used in detecting xylazine administration because it contains many [[metabolite]]s, which are the main targets and products in urine.<ref name=Greene /><ref name=Meyer /> Within a few hours, xylazine decreases to undetectable levels.<ref name=Ruiz! /> Other factors can also significantly impact the pharmacokinetics of xylazine, including sex, nutrition, environmental conditions, and prior diseases.<ref name=Veilleux-Lemieux />

==Side effects==

===Humans===
Xylazine overdose is usually fatal in humans.<ref name=Greene /> Because it is used as a drug [[adulterant]], the symptoms caused by the drugs accompanying xylazine administration vary between individuals.<ref name=Reyes />

The most common side effects in humans associated with xylazine administration include bradycardia, [[respiratory depression]], hypotension, transient [[hypertension]] secondary to [[vagus nerve stimulation]], and other changes in cardiac output.<ref name=Greene /><ref name=Reyes /> Xylazine significantly decreases heart rate in animals that are not premedicated with medications that have [[anticholinergic]] effects.<ref name=Greene /> The decrease in heart rate directly impacts [[aortic]] flow.<ref name=Greene /> Bradycardia caused by xylazine administration is effectively prevented by administration of [[atropine]] or [[glycopyrrolate]].<ref name=Greene /> [[Arrhythmias]] associated with xylazine includes other symptoms such as [[sinoatrial block]], [[atrioventricular block]], [[Ventricular inversion|A-V dissociation]], and [[sinus arrhythmia]].<ref name=Greene />

Xylazine administration can lead to [[diabetes mellitus]] and [[hyperglycemia]].<ref name=Xiao /> Other possible side effects that can occur are [[areflexia]], [[asthenia]], [[ataxia]], blurred vision, [[disorientation]], dizziness, drowsiness, [[dysarthria]], [[dysmetria]], fainting, [[hyporeflexia]], slurred speech, [[somnolence]], staggering, [[coma]], [[apnea]], shallow breathing, sleepiness, [[premature ventricular contraction]], [[tachycardia]], [[miosis]], and dry mouth.<ref name=Ruiz! /> Rarely, [[hypotonia]], dry mouth, [[urinary incontinence]] and nonspecific electrocardiographic [[ST segment]] changes occur.<ref name=Ruiz! /> It has been reported that the duration of symptoms after human overdose is 8 to 72 hours.<ref name=Ruiz! /> Further research is necessary to categorize the side effects that occur when xylazine is used in conjunction with heroin and cocaine.<ref name=Greene />

Chronic use is reported to be associated with physical deterioration, dependence, [[abscesses]], and [[skin ulcer]]ation, which can be physically debilitating and painful.<ref name=Ruiz! /><ref name=Xiao /> Hypertension followed by hypotension, bradycardia, and respiratory depression lower tissue oxygenation in the skin.<ref name=Reyes /> Thus, chronic use of xylazine can progress the skin oxygenation deficit, leading to severe skin ulceration.<ref name=Reyes /> Lower skin oxygenation is associated with impaired healing of wounds and a higher chance of infection.<ref name=Reyes /> The ulcers may have a characteristic odor and ooze pus.<ref name=Torruella /> In severe cases, amputations must be performed on the affected extremities.<ref name=Torruella />

===Animals===

Side effects in animals include transient hypertension, hypotension, and respiratory depression.<ref name=Ruiz! /> Further, the decrease of tissue sensitivity to insulin leads to xylazine-induced hyperglycemia and a reduction of tissue glucose uptake and utilization.<ref name=Xiao /> The duration of effects in animals lasts up to 4 hours.<ref name=Ruiz! />

==Recreational use==

Xylazine users are more likely to be male, under the age of 30, living in a rural area, and injecting versus inhaling xylazine.<ref name=Reyes /> Xylazine has similar behavioral consequences as heroin, thus it is commonly used as an adulterant.<ref name=Torruella /> Xylazine is also frequently found in [[Speedball (drug)|speedball]].<ref name=Ruiz! /> The combination of heroin and xylazine produces a stronger high than administration of heroin alone.<ref name=Ruiz! /> Concomitant use of xylazine with speedball may potentiate or prolong the effects of these drugs, which can lead to adverse consequences.<ref name=Silva-Torres />

Carruthers et al. in 1979 reported the first case of xylazine toxicity in a 34-year-old male, who self-medicated for [[insomnia]] with injection of 1 g of xylazine.<ref name=Barroso /> Intentional intoxication from ingesting, inhaling, or injecting xylazine has been reported.<ref name=Reyes /> The intravenous route is the most common route of administration for those who abuse heroin or xylazine recreationally.<ref name=Silva-Torres /> In Puerto Rico, xylazine has increased in popularity.  Its use was associated with a high number of inmate deaths at the [[Guerrero Correctional Institution]] in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico from 2002 through 2008.<ref name=Reyes />

==Treatment of overdose==

The known doses of xylazine that produce toxicity and fatality in humans vary from 40 to 2400&nbsp;mg.<ref name=Ruiz! /> Small doses may produce toxicity and larger doses may be survived with medical assistance.<ref name=Ruiz! /> Non-fatal blood or plasma concentration ranges from 0.03 to 4.6&nbsp;mg/L.<ref name=Silva-Torres /> In fatalities, the blood concentration of xylazine ranges from trace to 16&nbsp;mg/L.<ref name=Silva-Torres /> It is reported that there is no defined safe or fatal concentration of xylazine because of the significant overlap between the non-fatal and postmortem blood concentrations of xylazine.<ref name=Ruiz! />

Currently, there is no specific [[antidote]] to treat humans that overdose on xylazine. [[Hemodialysis]] has been suggested as a form of treatment, but is usually unfavorable due to the large volume of distribution of xylazine.<ref name=Ruiz! /> In addition, due to lack of research in humans, there are no standardized screenings to determine if an overdose has occurred. The detection of xylazine in biological fluids in humans involves various screening methods, such as urine screenings, [[thin layer chromatography]] (TLC), [[GC-MS|gas chromatography mass spectrometry]] (GC-MS), Remedi HS Bio-Rad Laboratories, and [[liquid chromatography mass spectrometry]] (LC-MS).<ref name=Meyer /><ref name=Silva-Torres />

Multiple drugs have been used as supportive therapeutic intervention such as [[lidocaine]], [[naloxone]], [[thiamine]], [[lorazepam]], [[vecuronium]], [[etomidate]], [[propofol]], [[tolazoline]], yohimbine, atropine, naloxone, [[orciprenaline]], [[metoclopramide]], [[ranitidine]], [[metoprolol]], [[enoxaparin]], [[flucloxacillin]], insulin, and irrigation of both eyes with [[Saline water|saline]].<ref name=Ruiz! /> Effects of xylazine are also reversed by the [[analeptic]]s [[4-aminopyridine]], [[doxapram]], and [[caffeine]], which are physiological [[Antagonist (pharmacology)|antagonists]] to central nervous system depressants.<ref name=Ndeereh>{{cite journal|last1=Ndeereh|first1=DR|last2=Mbithi|first2=PM|last3=Kihurani|first3=DO|title=The reversal of xylazine hydrochloride by yohimbine and 4-aminopyridine in goats.|journal=Journal of the South African Veterinary Association|date=June 2001|volume=72|issue=2|pages=64–7|pmid=11513261|doi=10.4102/jsava.v72i2.618}}</ref> Combining yohimbine and 4-aminopyridine in an effort to antagonize xylazine is superior as compared to the administration of either of these drugs individually due to reduction of recovery time.<ref name=Ndeereh /> Research initiatives may be necessary in order to standardize treatment and determine effective measures for identifying chronic xylazine usage and intoxication.<ref name=Greene />

The treatment after xylazine overdose should primarily involve maintaining respiratory function and blood pressure.<ref name=Ruiz! /> In cases of intoxication, physicians recommend intravenous fluid infusion, atropine, and hospital observation.<ref name=Greene /> Severe cases may require [[endotracheal intubation]], [[mechanical ventilation]], [[gastric lavage]], [[activated charcoal]], bladder [[catheterization]], [[electrocardiographic]] (ECG) and hyperglycemia monitoring.<ref name=Ruiz! /> Physicians typically recommend which detoxification treatment should be used to manage possible dysfunction involving highly perfused organs, such as the liver and kidney.<ref name=Silva-Torres />
