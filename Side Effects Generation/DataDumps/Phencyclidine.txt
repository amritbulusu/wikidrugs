'''Phencyclidine''' ('''PCP'''), also known as '''angel dust''' among other names,<ref>US Department of Justice, National Drug Intelligence Center. [http://www.justice.gov/archive/ndic/pubs4/4440/ PCP Fast Facts]</ref> is a [[dissociative drug]]. PCP was brought to market in the 1950s as an [[anesthesia|anesthetic]] [[pharmaceutical drug]] but was taken off the market in 1965 due to the high prevalence of [[dissociative]] [[hallucinogen]]ic side effects. Moreover, the discovery of [[ketamine]] by [[Parke-Davis]] researchers was thought to represent a better-tolerated alternative for use as an anesthetic [[medication]]. Since then a number of synthetic derivatives of PCP have been sold as dissociative drugs for recreational and non-medical use.<ref name=Morris>{{cite journal | vauthors = Morris H, Wallach J | title = From PCP to MXE: a comprehensive review of the non-medical use of dissociative drugs | journal = Drug Testing and Analysis | volume = 6 | issue = 7–8 | pages = 614–32 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24678061 | doi = 10.1002/dta.1620 }}</ref>

In [[chemistry|chemical]] structure, PCP is a member of the [[arylcyclohexylamine]] [[chemical classification|class]], and, in [[pharmacology]], it is a member of the family of [[dissociative anesthetic]]s. PCP works primarily as an [[NMDA receptor antagonist]]. As an [[addictive drug]], PCP is associated with compulsive abuse.<ref name="NHM-PCP and ketamine" /><ref name="Morris" /><ref>Drugs and Behavior, 4th Edition, McKim, William A., {{ISBN|0-13-083146-8}}</ref><ref>Kapur, S. and P.

As a recreational drug, PCP may be ingested [[Oral administration|orally]], [[Smoking|smoked]], [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflated]] or [[Injection (medicine)|injected]].<ref name="InfoFacts">{{cite web|url=http://drugabuse.gov/infofacts/hallucinogens.html|title=NIDA InfoFacts: Hallucinogens – LSD, Peyote, Psilocybin, and PCP|work=DrugAbuse.gov|publisher=National Institute on Drug Abuse|accessdate=2011-01-26}}</ref>

==Recreational uses==
[[File:Phencyclidine (PCP).jpg|thumb|left|Illicit PCP in several forms seized by the DEA.]]

PCP began to emerge as a [[recreational drug]] in major cities in the United States in 1967.<ref name=Inciardi>{{cite book |last = Inciardi |first = James A. |title = The War on Drugs II|publisher = Mayfield Publishing Company |year = 1992 |isbn = 1-55934-016-9}}</ref>{{rp|46}} In 1978, ''[[People (American magazine)|People]]'' magazine and [[Mike Wallace]] of ''[[60 Minutes]]'' called PCP the country's "number one" drug problem. Although recreational use of the drug had always been relatively low, it began declining significantly in the 1980s. In surveys, the number of [[High school (North America)|high school]] students admitting to trying PCP at least once fell from 13% in 1979 to less than 3% in 1990.<ref name=Inciardi />{{rp|46–49}}

PCP comes in both powder and liquid forms (PCP base is dissolved most often in [[diethyl ether|ether]]), but typically it is sprayed onto leafy material such as [[cannabis]], [[mentha|mint]], [[oregano]], [[tobacco]], [[parsley]], or [[ginger]] leaves, then smoked.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

PCP is a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule II controlled substances|Schedule II]] substance in the United States and its [[Administrative Controlled Substances Code Number|ACSCN]] is 7471.<ref>US Drug Enforcement Administration March 12, 2014 [http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/orangebook/d_cs_drugcode.pdf Controlled Substances] Page accessed June 15, 2014</ref> Its manufacturing quota for 2014 was 19 grams.<ref>US Drug Enforcement Administration August 30, 2013.

It is a Schedule I drug by the Controlled Drugs and Substances act in Canada, a List I drug of the [[Opium Law]] in the [[Netherlands]], and a [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971|Class A]] substance in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Modification) Order 1979|url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1979/299/article/2/made#text%253DPhencyclidine|website = www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date = 2016-01-31}}</ref>

===Methods of administration===
* PCP can be ingested through smoking. Fry is a street term for marijuana or tobacco cigarettes that are dipped in PCP and then dried.<ref>https://www.justice.gov/archive/ndic/pubs11/12208/</ref>
* PCP hydrochloride can be insufflated (snorted), depending upon the purity.
* The [[free base]] is quite hydrophobic and may be absorbed through skin and mucus membranes (often inadvertently).

===Effects===
{{See also|Excited delirium}}

Behavioral effects can vary by dosage. Low doses produce a numbness in the extremities and intoxication, characterized by staggering, unsteady gait, slurred speech, bloodshot eyes, and loss of balance. Moderate doses (5–10&nbsp;mg intranasal, or 0.01–0.02&nbsp;mg/kg intramuscular or intravenous) will produce [[analgesia]] and anesthesia. High doses may lead to [[convulsions]].<ref name="Diaz">Diaz, Jaime. How Drugs Influence Behavior. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall, 1996.</ref> The drug is often illegally produced under poorly-controlled conditions; this means that users may be unaware of the actual dose they are taking.<ref name="Neuroscience for Kids">{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/pcp.html|title=Neuroscience for Kids – PCP| last= Chudler| first= Eric H.|accessdate=2011-01-26|work=Neuroscience for Kids}}</ref>

Psychological effects include severe changes in [[body image]], [[Ego death|loss of ego boundaries]], [[paranoia]], and [[depersonalization]]. Hallucinations, [[euphoria]], and [[Suicidal ideation|suicidal impulses]] are also reported, as well as occasional aggressive behavior.<ref name=Inciardi />{{rp|48–49}}<ref name="Diaz" /> Like many other drugs, PCP has been known to alter mood states in an unpredictable fashion, causing some individuals to become detached, and others to become animated. PCP may induce feelings of strength, power, and invulnerability as well as a numbing effect on the mind.<ref name="InfoFacts" />

Studies by the [[Drug Abuse Warning Network]] in the 1970s show that media reports of PCP-induced violence are greatly exaggerated and that incidents of violence are unusual and often limited to individuals with reputations for aggression regardless of drug use.<ref name=Inciardi />{{rp|48}} Although uncommon, events of PCP-intoxicated individuals acting in an unpredictable fashion, possibly driven by their delusions or hallucinations, have been publicized.{{citation needed|date= February 2016}} One example is the case of [[Big Lurch]], a former [[rapper]] with a history of violent crime, who was convicted of murdering and cannibalizing his roommate while under the influence of PCP.<ref name= straightdope>[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2589/does-pcp-turn-people-into-cannibals Does PCP turn people into cannibals?] The Straight Dope, 2005</ref> Other commonly cited types of incidents include inflicting property damage and self-mutilation of various types, such as pulling one's own teeth.<ref name=Inciardi />{{rp|48}}<ref name="straightdope" /> These effects were not noted in its medicinal use in the 1950s and 1960s however, and reports of physical violence on PCP have often been shown to be unfounded.<ref name=brecher>{{cite journal | vauthors = Brecher M, Wang BW, Wong H, Morgan JP | title = Phencyclidine and violence: clinical and legal issues | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = 397–401 | date = Dec 1988 | pmid = 3069880 | doi = 10.1097/00004714-198812000-00003 }}</ref><ref name=wish>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wish ED | title = PCP and crime: just another illicit drug? | journal = NIDA Research Monograph | volume = 64 | pages = 174–89 | year = 1986 | pmid = 3086733 }}</ref>

Recreational doses of the drug also occasionally appear to [[Substance-induced psychosis|induce a psychotic state]] that resembles a [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] episode, sometimes lasting for months at a time.<ref>{{cite journal| last= Luisada |first= PV| title=The phencyclidine psychosis: phenomenology and treatment| editor-last1=Petersen |editor-first1= RC| editor-last2=Stillman |editor-first2=RC| url= http://archives.drugabuse.gov/pdf/monographs/21.pdf |work= Phencyclidine (PCP) abuse: an appraisal| publisher= National Institute on Drug Abuse| location=Rockville, Maryland| year=1978}}</ref> Users generally report feeling detached from reality.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pender JW | title = Dissociative anesthesia | journal = California Medicine | volume = 117 | issue = 4 | pages = 46–7 | date = Oct 1972 | pmid = 18730832 | pmc = 1518731 }}</ref>

PCP is well known for its primary action on the [[NMDA receptor]], an [[ionotropic glutamate receptor]], in rats and in rat brain homogenate.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Large CH, Bison S, Sartori I, Read KD, Gozzi A, Quarta D, Antolini M, Hollands E, Gill CH, Gunthorpe MJ, Idris N, Neill JC, Alvaro GS | title = The efficacy of sodium channel blockers to prevent phencyclidine-induced cognitive dysfunction in the rat: potential for novel treatments for schizophrenia | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 338 | issue = 1 | pages = 100–13 | date = Jul 2011 | pmid = 21487071 | doi = 10.1124/jpet.110.178475 }}</ref><ref name="pmid19391150" /> As such, PCP is an [[NMDA receptor antagonist]].

PCP, like ketamine, also acts as a potent [[dopamine]] [[D2 receptor|D<sub>2</sub><sup>High</sup> receptor]] [[partial agonist]] in rat brain homogenate<ref name="pmid19391150" /> and has affinity for the human cloned D<sub>2</sub><sup>High</sup> receptor.<ref name="D2 in ketamine and pcp">{{cite journal | vauthors = Seeman P, Ko F, Tallerico T | title = Dopamine receptor contribution to the action of PCP, LSD and ketamine psychotomimetics | journal = Molecular Psychiatry | volume = 10 | issue = 9 | pages = 877–83 | date = Sep 2005 | pmid = 15852061 | doi = 10.1038/sj.mp.4001682 }}</ref> This activity may be associated with some of the other more psychotic features of PCP intoxication, which is evidenced by the successful use of D<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists (such as [[haloperidol]]) in the treatment of PCP psychosis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Giannini AJ, Nageotte C, Loiselle RH, Malone DA, Price WA | title = Comparison of chlorpromazine, haloperidol and pimozide in the treatment of phencyclidine psychosis: DA-2 receptor specificity | journal = Journal of Toxicology.

In addition to its well explored interactions with NMDA receptors, PCP has also been shown to [[dopamine reuptake inhibitor|inhibit dopamine reuptake]], and thereby leads to increased extracellular levels of dopamine and hence increased [[dopaminergic]] [[neurotransmission]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rothman RB, Reid AA, Monn JA, Jacobson AE, Rice KC | title = The psychotomimetic drug phencyclidine labels two high affinity binding sites in guinea pig brain: evidence for N-methyl-D-aspartate-coupled and dopamine reuptake carrier-associated phencyclidine binding sites | journal = Molecular Pharmacology | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 887–96 | date = Dec 1989 | pmid = 2557536 }}</ref> However, PCP has little [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for the human [[monoamine transporter]]s, including the [[dopamine transporter]] (DAT).<ref name="pmid23527166" /> Instead, its [[monoamine reuptake inhibitor|inhibition of monoamine reuptake]] may be mediated by interactions with [[regulatory site|allosteric site]]s on the monoamine transporters.<ref name="pmid23527166" /> PCP is notably a high-affinity [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] of the [[PCP site 2]] (K<sub>i</sub> = 154&nbsp;nM), a not-well-characterized site associated with monoamine reuptake inhibition.<ref name="pmid7968938" />

Studies on rats indicate that PCP interacts indirectly with [[opioid receptor]]s ([[endorphin]] and [[enkephalin]]) to produce analgesia.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Castellani S, Giannini AJ, Adams PM | title = Effects of naloxone, metenkephalin, and morphine on phencyclidine-induced behavior in the rat | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 78 | issue = 1 | pages = 76–80 | year = 1982 | pmid = 6815700 | doi = 10.1007/BF00470593 }}</ref>

====Neurotoxicity====
Some studies found that, like other NMDA receptor antagonists, PCP can cause a kind of [[brain damage]] called [[Olney's lesions]] in rats.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Olney JW, Labruyere J, Price MT | title = Pathological changes induced in cerebrocortical neurons by phencyclidine and related drugs | journal = Science | volume = 244 | issue = 4910 | pages = 1360–2 | date = Jun 1989 | pmid = 2660263 | doi = 10.1126/science.2660263 | bibcode = 1989Sci...244.1360O }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hargreaves RJ, Hill RG, Iversen LL | title = Neuroprotective NMDA antagonists: the controversy over their potential for adverse effects on cortical neuronal morphology | journal = Acta Neurochirurgica.

All studies of Olney's lesions have only been performed on non-human animals and may not apply to humans. One unpublished study by Frank Sharp reportedly showed no damage by the NDMA antagonist, ketamine, a similar drug, far beyond recreational doses,<ref>Jansen, Karl. ''Ketamine: Dreams and Realities''. MAPS, 2004. {{ISBN|0-9660019-7-4}}</ref> but due to the study never having been published, its validity is controversial.

PCP has also been shown to cause schizophrenia-like changes in ''N''-acetylaspartate and ''N''-acetylaspartylglutamate levels in the rat brain, which are detectable both in living rats and upon necropsy examination of brain tissue.<ref name=psychotic_PCP_rats>{{cite journal | vauthors = Reynolds LM, Cochran SM, Morris BJ, Pratt JA, Reynolds GP | title = Chronic phencyclidine administration induces schizophrenia-like changes in N-acetylaspartate and N-acetylaspartylglutamate in rat brain | journal = Schizophrenia Research | volume = 73 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 147–52 | date = Mar 2005 | pmid = 15653257 | doi = 10.1016/j.schres.2004.02.003 }}</ref> It also induces symptoms in humans that mimic schizophrenia.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Murray JB | title = Phencyclidine (PCP): a dangerous drug, but useful in schizophrenia research | journal = The Journal of Psychology | volume = 136 | issue = 3 | pages = 319–27 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 12206280 | doi = 10.1080/00223980209604159 }}</ref> PCP not only produced symptoms similar to schizophrenia, it also yielded [[electroencephalogram]] changes in the thalamocortical pathway (increased delta decreased alpha) and in the hippocampus (increase theta bursts) that were similar to those in schizophrenia.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lodge|first1=D|last2=Mercier|first2=M S|title=Ketamine and phencyclidine: the good, the bad and the unexpected|journal=British Journal of Pharmacology|date=19 January 2017|volume=172|issue=17|pages=4254–4276|doi=10.1111/bph.13222|pmc=4556466|issn=0007-1188|pmid=26075331}}</ref> PCP induced augmentation of dopamine release may link the NMDA and DA hypothesis of schizophrenia.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Javitt|first1=Daniel C.|last2=Zukin|first2=Stephen R.|last3=Heresco-Levy|first3=Uriel|last4=Umbricht|first4=Daniel|title=Has an Angel Shown the Way?

===Pharmacokinetics===
PCP is metabolized into [[PCHP]], [[4-Phenyl-4-(1-piperidinyl)cyclohexanol|PPC]] and [[PCAA]].

When smoked, some of the compound is broken down by heat into [[1-phenyl-1-cyclohexene|1-phenylcyclohexene]] (PC) and [[piperidine]].

===Structural analogues===
[[File:ACHA SAR.png|210px|right|thumbnail|Possible Analogues of PCP]]

Fewer than 30 different analogues of PCP were reported as being used on the street during the 1970s and 1980s, mainly in the USA.<ref name="Morris" /> The best known of these are [[rolicyclidine]] (PCPy or 1-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)pyrrolidine); [[eticyclidine]] (PCE or ''N''-ethyl-1-phenylcyclohexylamine); and [[tenocyclidine]] (TCP or 1-(1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl)piperidine).<ref>[http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/pcp/pcp_index.html PCP synthesis and effects]</ref> Only of a few of these compounds were widely used.<ref name="Morris" />

The generalized structural motif required for PCP-like activity is derived from structure-activity relationship studies of PCP derivatives, and summarized in the illustration (right). All of these derivatives are likely to share some of their psychoactive effects with PCP itself, although a range of potencies and varying mixtures of anesthetic, dissociative and stimulant effects are known, depending on the particular drug and its substituents. In some countries such as the USA, Australia, and New Zealand, all of these compounds would be considered [[Federal Analog Act|controlled substance analogues]] of PCP, and are hence illegal drugs if sold for human consumption, even though many of them have never been made or tested.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Itzhak Y, Kalir A, Weissman BA, Cohen S | title = New analgesic drugs derived from phencyclidine | journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 496–9 | date = May 1981 | pmid = 7241506 | doi = 10.1021/jm00137a004 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chaudieu I, Vignon J, Chicheportiche M, Kamenka JM, Trouiller G, Chicheportiche R | title = Role of the aromatic group in the inhibition of phencyclidine binding and dopamine uptake by PCP analogs | journal = Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Behavior | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = 699–705 | date = Mar 1989 | pmid = 2544905 | doi = 10.1016/0091-3057(89)90020-8 }}</ref>{{Clarify|date=November 2008}}

Other analogues of PCP include [[3-HO-PCP]], [[3-MeO-PCMo]], and [[3-MeO-PCP]].

==History==
It is commonly mistakenly reported that PCP was first synthesized in 1926.<ref>[http://www.cesar.umd.edu/cesar/drugs/pcp.pdf Development of PCP], 2006, CESAR (Center for Substance Abuse Research)</ref> This early synthesis, in fact, refers to the PCP [[Reaction intermediate|intermediate]] PCC.<ref name="Morris" /> PCP was actually discovered by Victor Maddox, a chemist at [[Parke-Davis]] in Michigan, while investigating synthetic analgesic agents. Although unexpected, PCP was identified as potentially interesting, and as such, was submitted for pharmacological testing. The promising results of these pharmacological investigations led to the rapid development of PCP. It was approved for use as an investigational drug under the brand names Sernyl and Sernylan in the 1950s as an anesthetic, but because of its long [[biological half-life|terminal half-life]] and adverse [[adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]], such as hallucinations, [[mania]], [[delirium]], and [[disorientation]], it was removed from the market in 1965 and limited to veterinary use.<ref name="Morris" /><ref name=LowinsonEtAl2005>{{cite book |year=2005 |author=Zukin, Stephen R |author2=Sloboda, Zili |author3=Javitt, Daniel C |chapter=Phencyclidine (PCP) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=HtGb2wNsgn4C&pg=PA324&dq=Phencyclidine+history&hl=en&ei=lVH3TLLzJYrWvQOW-PCdDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEIQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=Phencyclidine%20history&f=false|editor=Lowinson, Joyce H |editor2=Ruiz, Pedro |editor3=Millman, Robert B |editor3-link=Robert Millman |display-editors = 3 |editor4=Langrod, John G |title=Substance Abuse: A Comprehensive Textbook |edition=4th |place=Philadelphia |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=0-7817-3474-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HtGb2wNsgn4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=substance+comprehensive+textbook#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=2 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Drug Use and Abuse |last=Maisto |first=Stephen A. |author2=Mark Galizio |author3=Gerard Joseph Connors |year=2004 |publisher=Thompson Wadsworth |isbn=0-15-508517-4 }}</ref>
