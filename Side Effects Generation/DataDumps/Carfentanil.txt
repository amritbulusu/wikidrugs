'''Carfentanil''' or '''carfentanyl''' is an [[structural analog|analog]] of the synthetic [[opioid]] [[analgesic]] [[fentanyl]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/drug-profiles/fentanyl | title=Fentanyl drug profile | publisher=EMCDDA}}</ref> It is 10,000 times more potent than [[morphine]], making it among the most potent commercially used opioids.<ref name=DrugBank>{{cite web|title=Carfentanil|url=https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01535|website=DrugBank|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref> Carfentanil was first synthesized in 1974 by a team of chemists at [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]] which included [[Paul Janssen]].<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Theodore H.|last1=Stanley|first2=Talmage D.|last2=Egan|first3=Hugo Van|last3=Aken|title=A Tribute to Dr. Paul A.

Carfentanil is classified as [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule II controlled substances|Schedule II]] under the [[Controlled Substances Act]] in the United States with a [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] [[Administrative Controlled Substances Code Number|ACSCN]] of 9743 and a 2016 annual aggregate manufacturing quota of 19 grams.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Established Aggregate Production Quotas for Schedule I and II Controlled Substances and Assessment of Annual Needs for the List I Chemicals Ephedrine, Pseudoephedrine, and Phenylpropanolamine for 2016|publisher=Federal Register|date=6 October 2015|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/10/06/2015-25373/established-aggregate-production-quotas-for-schedule-i-and-ii-controlled-substances-and-assessment}}</ref>

==Moscow theater hostage crisis==
{{Main|Moscow theater hostage crisis}}
In 2012, a team of researchers at the British chemical and biological defense laboratories at [[Porton Down]] found carfentanil and [[remifentanil]] in clothing from two British survivors of the 2002 [[Moscow theater hostage crisis]] and in the urine from a third survivor.  The team concluded that the Russian military used an aerosol mist of carfentanil and remifentanil to subdue [[Chechnya|Chechen]] hostage takers.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=James R.|last1=Riches|first2=Robert W.|last2=Read|first3=Robin M.|last3=Black|first4=Nicholas J.|last4=Cooper|title=Analysis of Clothing and Urine from Moscow Theatre Siege Casualties Reveals Carfentanil and Remifentanil Use|url=http://jat.oxfordjournals.org/content/36/9/647.full|journal=Journal of Analytical Toxicology|date=November 2012|issn=1945-2403|pages=647–656|volume=36|issue=9|pmid=23002178|doi=10.1093/jat/bks078|first5=Christopher M.|last5=Timperley}}</ref>

Authors of a previous paper in the [[Annals of Emergency Medicine]] surmised from the available evidence that the Moscow emergency services had not been informed of the use of the agent, but were instructed to bring [[opioid antagonist]]s. Not knowing to expect hundreds of patients exposed to high doses of strong opioids, the emergency workers did not bring enough [[naloxone]] or [[naltrexone]] (the two most commonly-used opioid antagonists) to counteract the carfentanil and remifentanil and save the lives of many of the victims. 125 people exposed to the gas used in the rescue attempt are confirmed to have died from both respiratory failure and aerosol inhalation during the incident.  The authors state that, assuming carfentanil and remifentanil were the only active ingredients of the [[knockout gas]], that the worst danger to the theater victims would have been [[apnea]] (loss of breathing), and that [[mechanical ventilation]] and/or treatment with opioid antagonists could have saved many lives.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Paul M.|last1=Wax|first2=Charles E.|last2=Becker|first3=Steven C.|last3=Curry|title=Unexpected "gas" casualties in Moscow: A medical toxicology perspective|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064403001094|journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine|date=May 2003|pages=700–705|volume=41|issue=5|doi=10.1067/mem.2003.148|pmid=12712038}}</ref>

==Importation from China== 
According to an Associated Press article from 2016, "Chemical weapon for sale: China's unregulated narcotic", [[fentanyl]], carfentanil and other highly potent derivatives of fentanyl are actively marketed by several Chinese chemical companies.<ref name="AP_Weber" /> Carfentanil was not a controlled substance in China until March 1, 2017,<ref>https://www.yahoo.com/news/china-makes-deadly-opioid-carfentanil-controlled-substance-020744508.html</ref> and until then had been manufactured legally and sold openly over the Internet.

Authorities in Latvia and Lithuania have reported seizing carfentanil as an illicit drug in the early 2000s.<ref name="AP_Weber" /><ref name="Europe">{{cite journal|first1=Jane|last1=Mounteney|first2=Isabelle|last2=Giraudon|first3=Gleb|last3=Denissov|first4=Paul|last4=Griffiths|title=Fentanyls: Are we missing the signs?

In June, 2016 the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] seized one kilogram of carfentanil shipped from China in a box labelled "printer accessories". According to the Canada Border Services Agency, the shipment contained 50 million lethal doses of the drug, more than enough to wipe out the entire population of the country, in containers labeled as [[toner cartridge]]s for [[Hewlett-Packard LaserJet]] printers. Allan Lai, an officer-in-charge at the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Calgary who helped oversee the criminal investigation said, "With respect to carfentanil, we don't know why a substance of that potency is coming into our country."<ref name="AP_Weber">{{Cite news |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/7c85cda5658e46f3a3be95a367f727e6/chemical-weapon-sale-chinas-unregulated-narcotic |title=Chemical weapon for sale: China's unregulated narcotic |last=Kinetz |first=Erika |date=7 October 2016 |work=AP News |access-date=12 April 2016 |agency=The Associated Press |last2=Butler |first2=Desmond |publication-place=New York, NY 10281 USA |publication-date=7 October 2016}}</ref>

==Increase in illicit use==
{{see also|Gray death}}
A November 2016 article in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', "Heroin Is Being Laced With a Terrifying New Substance: What to Know About Carfentanil", reports over 300 cases of carfentanil overdose and several deaths connected to the drug since August 2016 in several of the United States, including [[Ohio]], [[West Virginia]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]] and [[Florida]].<ref name ="Time_Ohio">{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4485792/heroin-carfentanil-drugs-ohio/|title=Heroin Is Being Laced With a Terrifying New Substance|last=Sanburn|first=Josh|website=TIME.com|access-date=2016-11-24}}</ref> In 2017, a [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]] man died from a carfentanil overdose, likely taken unknowingly with another illegal drug such as [[heroin]] or [[cocaine]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/milwaukee/2017/04/17/carfentanil-10000-times-more-potent-than-morphine-kills-homeless-man-milwaukee/100572902/|title=Carfentanil, 10,000 times more potent than morphine, kills homeless man in Milwaukee|last=Stephenson|first=Crocker|date=17 April 2017|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref> Carfentanil is most often taken with [[heroin]] or by users who believe they are taking heroin. Carfentanil is added to or sold as heroin because it is less expensive, easier to obtain (Chinese firms advertise and sell carfentanil over the Internet, offering advice to customers in other countries on how to import it illegally) and easier to make than genuine heroin.<ref name="AP_Weber" />

==Potential as a chemical weapon==
The toxicity of carfentanil has been compared to that of [[Nerve agent|nerve gas]], according to the Associated Press' article "Chemical weapon for sale: China's unregulated narcotic". The article quoted [[Andrew C. Weber]],  [[Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical & Biological Defense Programs|Assistant US Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Defense Programs]] from 2009 to 2014, as saying "It's a weapon. Companies shouldn't be just sending it to anybody."  Mr. Weber added "Countries that we are concerned about were interested in using it for offensive purposes... We are also concerned that groups like [[ISIS]] could order it commercially."  Mr. Weber described various ways carfentanil could be used as a weapon, such as knocking troops out and taking them hostage or killing civilians in closed spaces such as train stations.<ref name="AP_Weber" />
