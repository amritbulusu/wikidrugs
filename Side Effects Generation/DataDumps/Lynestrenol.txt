'''Lynestrenol''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]], [[Japanese Accepted Name|JAN]]), also known as '''17α-ethynyl-3-desoxy-19-nortestosterone''' or '''17α-ethynylestr-4-en-17β-ol''', is a [[steroid]]al [[progestin]] of the [[19-nortestosterone]] group. It is a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]], [[oral administration|orally active]] [[progestogen]] and has a strong progestogenic effect on the [[uterus|uterine]] [[endometrium]] (transforming proliferative endometrium into secretory one), inhibits secretion of [[gonadotropin]]s, suppresses maturation of [[ovarian follicle|follicle]]s in the [[ovary|ovaries]] and [[ovulation]], and reduces [[menstruation|menstrual bleeding]]. It is used as an [[oral contraceptive]] and in the treatment of [[gynecological disorder]]s.

==Pharmacology==
Lynestrenol itself does not bind to the [[progesterone receptor]] and is inactive as a [[progestogen]].<ref name="pmid436304">{{cite journal | vauthors = Odlind V, Weiner E, Victor A, Johansson ED | title = Plasma levels of norethindrone after single oral dose administration of norethindrone and lynestrenol | journal = Clin.

===Synthesis===
In another approach to analogs, [[nortestosterone]] ('''1''') is first converted to the di[[thioketal]] ('''2''') by treatment with [[1,2-Ethanedithiol|dithioglycol]] in the presence of [[boron trifluoride]]. (The mild conditions of this reaction compared to those usually employed in preparing the oxygen ketals probably accounts for the double bond remaining at 4,5). Treatment of this derivative with sodium in liquid ammonia affords the 3-desoxy analog ('''3'''). Oxidation by means of [[Jones reagent]] followed by [[Alkynylation|ethynylation]] of the [[17-Ketosteroid|17-ketone]] leads to the orally active progestin ('''6''').
