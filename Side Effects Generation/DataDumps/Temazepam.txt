'''Temazepam''' (brand names '''Restoril''' and '''Normison''', [[#Availability|among others]]) is an intermediate-acting 3-hydroxy [[hypnotic]] of the [[benzodiazepine]] [[chemical classification|class]] of [[psychoactive drugs]]. It is the ''3-hydroxy'' analogue of [[diazepam]], and one of diazepam's primary [[active metabolite]]s. Temazepam is [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|approved]] for the short-term treatment of [[insomnia]]. In addition, temazepam has [[anxiolytic]] (antianxiety), [[anticonvulsant]], and [[skeletal muscle relaxant]] properties.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wynn RL |author2=McFarland SA |author3=Meyer EA |author4=Coffman WB |author5=Mumford R  |year=1980 |title=Structure activity relationships of selected benzodiazepines as anticonvulsants to local anesthetics |journal=Pharmacol Ther Dent |volume=5 | issue=1-2 |pages=39–45 |pmid=6774348 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Siciliani O |author2=Schiavon M |author3=Tansella M  |journal=Acta Psychiatr Scand |date=August 1975 |title=Anxiety and EEG alpha activity in neurotic patients |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=116–31 |pmid=1096540 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.1975.tb00028.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Fuccella LM |title=Bioavailability of temazepam in soft gelatin capsules |journal=Br J Clin Pharmacol |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=31S–5S |year=1979 |pmid=41540 |pmc=1429631 |format=PDF |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.1979.tb00452.x}}</ref>

The [[United States Air Force]] uses temazepam as one of the hypnotics approved as a "[[no-go pill]]" to help aviators and special-duty personnel sleep in support of mission readiness. "Ground tests" are necessary prior to required authorization being issued to use the medication in an operational situation, and a 12-hour restriction is imposed on subsequent flight operation.<ref name=Caldwell>{{ cite journal | last = Caldwell | first = J.

==Contraindications==
Use of temazepam should be avoided, when possible, in individuals with these conditions:
* [[Ataxia]] (gross lack of coordination of muscle movements)
* Severe [[hypoventilation]]
* Acute narrow-angle [[glaucoma]]
* Severe [[hepatic]] deficiencies ([[hepatitis]] and liver [[cirrhosis]] decrease elimination by a factor of two)
* Severe [[renal]] deficiencies (e.g. patients on [[dialysis]])
* [[Sleep apnea]]<ref name='WebMdProf'>{{cite web | url = http://www.medscape.com/druginfo/dosage?drugid=8715&drugname=Temazepam+Oral&monotype=default | title = Temazepam Oral | accessdate = 2010-08-22 | work = Web MD Professional | publisher = Medscape}}</ref>
* Severe [[clinical depression|depression]], particularly when accompanied by suicidal tendencies
* Acute intoxication with alcohol, narcotics, or other psychoactive substances
* [[Myasthenia gravis]] (autoimmune disorder causing muscle weakness)
* [[Hypersensitivity]] or allergy to any drug in the [[benzodiazepine]] class

===Special caution needed===
Temazepam should not be used in [[pregnancy]], as it may cause harm to the [[fetus]]. The safety and effectiveness of temazepam has not been established in children; therefore, temazepam should generally not be given to individuals under 18 years of age, and should not be used at all in children under six months old. Benzodiazepines also require special caution if used in the elderly, alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals, and individuals with [[comorbid]] [[psychiatric disorders]].<ref>{{ Cite journal | last1 = Authier | first1 = N. | last2 = Balayssac | first2 = D. | last3 = Sautereau | first3 = M. | last4 = Zangarelli | first4 = A. | last5 = Courty | first5 = P. | last6 = Somogyi | first6 = A.

Temazepam, similar to other benzodiazepines and [[nonbenzodiazepine]] hypnotic drugs, causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. The combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments.<ref name="Mets-2010">{{ Cite journal | last1 = Mets | first1 = M. A. | last2 = Volkerts | first2 = E.

This risk is increased when temazepam is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress the [[central nervous system]] (CNS).<ref name="DrugsCom"/>

===People at a high risk for misuse and dependence===
Because benzodiazepines can be abused and lead to dependence, their use should be avoided in people in certain particularly high-risk groups. These groups include people with a history of alcohol or drug dependence, people significantly struggling with their mood or people with longstanding mental health difficulties . If temazepam must be prescribed to people in these groups, they should generally be monitored very closely for signs of [[Substance misuse|misuse]] and development of dependence.<ref name="tembnf" />

==Adverse effects==
{{See also|Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome}}

===Common===
Side effects typical of hypnotic benzodiazepines are related to CNS depression, and include [[somnolence]], sedation, drunkenness, [[dizziness]], [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[ataxia]], [[headache]], [[lethargy]], impairment of [[memory]] and [[learning]], longer [[reaction time]] and impairment of motor functions (including [[motor coordination|coordination]] problems),<ref name="pmid38627">{{ cite journal | author = Liljequist, R. |author2=Mattila, M.

[[Euphoria]] was rarely reported with its use. According to the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]], temazepam had an incidence of euphoria of 1.5%, much more rarely reported than [[headache]]s and [[diarrhea]].<ref name="DrugsCom">{{ cite web | title = Temazepam | url = http://www.drugs.com/pro/temazepam.html |date=October 2007 | publisher = Drugs.com | accessdate = 2007-11-25 }}</ref> [[Anterograde amnesia]] may also develop, as may [[respiratory depression]] in higher doses.

===Less common===
[[Hyperhydrosis]], [[hypotension]], burning eyes, increased appetite, changes in [[libido]], hallucinations, faintness, [[Pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]], [[Nausea|vomiting]], [[pruritus]], gastrointestinal disturbances, nightmares, [[palpitation]] and paradoxical reactions including restlessness, aggression, violence, overstimulation and agitation have been reported, but are rare (less than 0.5%).

Before taking temazepam, one should ensure that at least 8 hours are available to dedicate to sleep. Failing to do so can increase the side effects of the drug.

Like all benzodiazepines, the use of this drug in combination with alcohol potentiates the side effects, and can lead to [[toxicity]] and [[death]].

Though rare, residual "[[hangover]]" effects after night-time administration of temazepam occasionally occur. These include sleepiness, impaired psychomotor and [[cognitive]] functions which may persist into the next day, impaired ability of users to drive safely, and possible increased risks of falls and [[hip fractures]], especially in the elderly.<ref>{{ cite journal | author = Vermeeren, A. | year = 2004 | title = Residual effects of hypnotics: epidemiology and clinical implications | journal = CNS Drugs | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 297–328 | pmid = 15089115 | doi = 10.2165/00023210-200418050-00003 }}</ref>

Establishing continued efficacy beyond a few weeks can be complicated by the difficulty in distinguishing between the return of the original insomnia complaint and withdrawal or rebound related insomnia. Sleep [[EEG]] studies on hypnotic benzodiazepines show tolerance tends to occur completely after one to four weeks with sleep EEG returning to pretreatment levels. The paper concluded, due to concerns about long-term use both toxicity and tolerance and dependence, as well as controversy over long-term efficacy, wise prescribers should restrict benzodiazepines to a few weeks and avoid continuing prescriptions for months or years.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lader MH |title=Limitations on the use of benzodiazepines in anxiety and insomnia: are they justified? |journal=Eur Neuropsychopharmacol |volume=9 Suppl 6 |issue= |pages=S399–405 |date=December 1999 |pmid=10622686 |doi=10.1016/S0924-977X(99)00051-6}}</ref> A review of the literature found the nonpharmacological treatment options were a more effective treatment option for insomnia due to their sustained improvements in sleep quality.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kirkwood CK |title=Management of insomnia |journal=J Am Pharm Assoc (Wash) |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=688–96; quiz 713–4 |year=1999 |pmid=10533351 }}</ref>

===Physical dependence===

Temazepam, like other [[benzodiazepine]] drugs, can cause [[physical dependence]] and [[Substance use disorder|addiction]]. Withdrawal from temazepam or other benzodiazepines after regular use often leads to a [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]], which resembles symptoms during alcohol and [[barbiturate]] withdrawal. The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can also occur from standard dosages and after short-term use. Abrupt withdrawal from therapeutic doses of temazepam after long-term use may result in a severe [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]]. Gradual and careful reduction of the dosage, preferably with a long-acting benzodiazepine with long half-life [[active metabolites]], such as [[chlordiazepoxide]] or [[diazepam]], are recommended to prevent severe withdrawal syndromes from developing. Other hypnotic benzodiazepines are not recommended.<ref>{{cite journal |author=MacKinnon GL |author2=Parker WA  |year=1982 |title=Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome: a literature review and evaluation |journal=The American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=19–33 |pmid=6133446 |doi=10.3109/00952998209002608}}</ref> A study in rats found temazepam is [[cross tolerant]] with barbiturates and is able to effectively substitute for barbiturates and suppress barbiturate withdrawal signs.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yutrzenka GJ, Patrick GA, Rosenberger W |title=Substitution of temazepam and midazolam in pentobarbital-dependent rats |journal=Physiol.

Patients who were treated in the hospital with temazepam or [[nitrazepam]] have continued taking these after leaving the hospital. Hypnotic uses in the hospital were recommended to be limited to five nights' use only, to avoid the development of withdrawal symptoms such as insomnia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hecker R |author2=Burr M |author3=Newbury G  |year=1992 |title=Risk of benzodiazepine dependence resulting from hospital admission |journal=Drug Alcohol Rev |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=131–5 |pmid=16840267 |doi=10.1080/09595239200185601}}</ref>

==Interactions==
As with other benzodiazepines, temazepam produces additive [[Central nervous system depression|CNS-depressant]] effects when coadministered with other medications which themselves produce CNS depression, such as barbiturates, alcohol,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Liljequist R |author2=Palva E |author3=Linnoila M  |journal=Int Pharmacopsychiatry |year=1979 |title=Effects on learning and memory of 2-week treatments with chlordiazepoxide lactam, N-desmethyldiazepam, oxazepam and methyloxazepam, alone or in combination with alcohol |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=190–8 |pmid=42628}}</ref> [[opiates]], [[tricyclic antidepressants]], nonselective [[MAO inhibitor]]s, [[phenothiazines]] and other [[antipsychotic]]s, skeletal muscle relaxants, [[antihistamines]], and [[anaesthetics]]. Administration of [[theophylline]] or [[aminophylline]] has been shown to reduce the sedative effects of temazepam and other benzodiazepines.

Unlike many benzodiazepines, [[pharmacokinetic]] interactions involving the P450 system have not been observed with temazepam.

==Overdose==
[[File:Temazepam 10mg tablets-1.jpg|thumb|[[generic drug|Generic]] temazepam 10 mg tablets]]
{{Main|Benzodiazepine overdose}}

Overdosage of temazepam results in increasing CNS effects, including:

* [[Somnolence]] (difficulty staying awake)
* Mental confusion
* Respiratory depression
* [[Hypotension]]
* Impaired motor functions
* Impaired or absent reflexes
* Impaired coordination
* Impaired balance

==Pharmacology==
Temazepam is a white, crystalline substance, very slightly soluble in water, and sparingly soluble in alcohol. Its main pharmacological action is to increase the effect of the [[neurotransmitter]] gamma-aminobutyric acid ([[GABA]]) at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor. This causes sedation, motor impairment, ataxia, anxiolysis, an anticonvulsant effect, muscle relaxation, and a reinforcing effect.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Oelschläger H |date= July 4, 1989 |title=[Chemical and pharmacologic aspects of benzodiazepines] |journal=Schweiz Rundsch Med Prax |volume=78 |issue=27–28 |pages=766–72 |pmid=2570451}}</ref>  As a medication before surgery, temazepam decreased cortisol in elderly patients.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Salonen M, Kanto J, Hovi-Viander M, Irjala K, Viinamäki O |title=Oral temazepam as a premedicant in elderly general surgical patients |journal=Acta Anaesthesiol Scand |volume=30 |issue=8 |pages=689–92 |date=November 1986 |pmid=2880447 |doi= 10.1111/j.1399-6576.1986.tb02503.x }}</ref>  In rats, it triggered the release of [[vasopressin]] into [[paraventricular nucleus]] of the [[hypothalamus]] and decreased the release of ACTH under stress.<ref name="pmid16395302">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Welt T, Engelmann M, Renner U, etal |title=Temazepam triggers the release of vasopressin into the rat hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus: novel insight into benzodiazepine action on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical system activity during stress |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=31 |issue=12 |pages=2573–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16395302 |doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1301006 |url=http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v31/n12/full/1301006a.html}}</ref>

==Pharmacokinetics==
Oral administration of 15 to 45&nbsp;mg of temazepam in humans resulted in rapid absorption with significant blood levels achieved in fewer than 30 minutes and peak levels at two to three hours.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.rxmed.com/b.main/b2.pharmaceutical/b2.1.monographs/CPS-%20Monographs/CPS-%20(General%20Monographs-%20R)/RESTORIL.html | title = RESTORIL® Novartis Temazepam Hypnotic | work = Pharmaceutical Information | publisher = RxMed }}</ref>
In a single- and multiple-dose absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) study, using [[tritium]]-labelled drug, temazepam was well absorbed and found to have minimal (8%) first-pass [[drug metabolism]]. No active metabolites were formed and the only significant metabolite present in blood was the O-conjugate.  The unchanged drug was 96% bound to plasma proteins. The blood-level decline of the parent drug was biphasic, with the short half-life ranging from 0.4-0.6 hours and the terminal half-life from 3.5–18.4 hours (mean 8.8 hours), depending on the study population and method of determination.<ref name="pmid2891534">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Müller FO, Van Dyk M, Hundt HK, etal |title=Pharmacokinetics of temazepam after day-time and night-time oral administration |journal=Eur.

Temazepam has very good bioavailability, with almost 100% being absorbed from the gut. The drug is metabolized through conjugation and [[demethylation]] prior to excretion. Most of the drug is excreted in the urine, with about 20% appearing in the faeces. The major metabolite was the O-conjugate of temazepam (90%); the O-conjugate of N-desmethyl temazepam was a minor metabolite (7%).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schwarz HJ |date= August 1, 1979 |title=Pharmacokinetics and metabolism of temazepam in man and several animal species |volume=8 |issue=1 |pmid=41539 |pmc=1429628 |format=PDF |pages=23S–29S |journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.1979.tb00451.x}}</ref>

==History==
Temazepam was synthesized in 1964, but it came into use in 1981 when its ability to counter insomnia was realized.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Maggini C |author2=Murri M |author3=Sacchetti G  |journal=Arzneimittelforschung |date=October 1969 |title=Evaluation of the effectiveness of temazepam on the insomnia of patients with neurosis and endogenous depression |volume=19 |issue=10 |pages=1647–52 |pmid=4311716}}</ref> By the late 1980s, temazepam was one of the most popular and widely prescribed{{fact|date=October 2016}} [[hypnotics]] on the market and it became one of the most widely prescribed drugs.

{{See also|Benzodiazepine drug misuse}}

Temazepam is a drug with a high potential for misuse.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Griffiths RR, Johnson MW |title=Relative abuse liability of hypnotic drugs: a conceptual framework and algorithm for differentiating among compounds |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=66 Suppl 9 |issue= |pages=31–41 |year=2005 |pmid=16336040 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

Benzodiazepines have been abused both orally and intravenously. Different benzodiazepines have different abuse potential; the more rapid the increase in the plasma level following ingestion, the greater the intoxicating effect and the more open to abuse the drug becomes. The speed of onset of action of a particular benzodiazepine correlates well with the ‘popularity’ of that drug for abuse. The two most common reasons for preference were that a benzodiazepine was ‘strong’ and that it gave a good ‘high’.<ref name="Australian Government 2006">{{cite web | url = http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/ni/2006-175/current/pdf/2006-175.pdf | title = ACT MEDICAL BOARD&nbsp;– STANDARDS STATEMENT&nbsp;– PRESCRIBING OF BENZODIAZEPINES | accessdate = 13 September 2011 | author = Australian Government | authorlink = Australian Government |author2=Medical Board | year = 2006 | format = pdf | publisher = ACT medical board | location = Australia }}</ref>

A 1985 study found that temazepam and [[triazolam]] maintained significantly higher rates of self-injection than a variety of other benzodiazepines. The study tested and compared the abuse liability of temazepam, triazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, oxazepam, flurazepam, alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, bromazepam, and clorazepate. The study tested self-injection rates on human, baboon, and rat subjects. All test subjects consistently showed a strong preference for temazepam and triazolam over all the rest of the benzodiazepines included in the study.<ref name=abuse>{{cite journal|last=GRIFFITHS|first=Roland R.|author2=RICHARD J.

====North America====
In North America, temazepam misuse is not widespread. Other benzodiazepines are more commonly prescribed for insomnia. In the [[United States]], temazepam is the fifth-most prescribed benzodiazepine. Individuals abusing benzodiazepines obtain the drug by getting prescriptions from several doctors, forging prescriptions, or buying diverted pharmaceutical products on the illicit market.<ref>[http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drugs_concern/benzo_1.htm BENZODIAZEPINES (Street Names: Benzos, Downers, Nerve Pills,Resties, Tranks)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  North America has never had a serious problem with temazepam misuse, but is becoming increasingly vulnerable to the illicit trade of temazepam.<ref>Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (BINLEA), 2006.</ref>

Benzodiazepines are commonly detected by Customs at different ports and airports, arriving by mail, also found occasionally in the baggage of air passengers, mostly small or medium quantities (up to 200–300 tablets) for personal use. From 2003 to 2006, customs detected about 500 illegal importations of benzodiazepines per year, most frequently diazepam.

====United Kingdom====
In 1987, temazepam was the most widely abused legal prescription drug in the United Kingdom. The use of benzodiazepines by street-drug abusers was part of a polydrug abuse pattern, but many of those entering treatment facilities were declaring temazepam as their main drug of abuse. Temazepam was the most commonly used benzodiazepine in a study, published 1994, of injecting drug users in seven cities, and had been injected from preparations of capsules, tablets, and syrup.<ref name="Ashton">{{cite book |author=Ashton H |title=Drugs and Dependence |chapter= Benzodiazepine Abuse |chapterurl=http://www.benzo.org.uk/ashbzab.htm |year=2002 |publisher=Harwood Academic Publishers |location=London & New York }}</ref> The increase in use of heroin, often mixed with other drugs, which most often included temazepam, diazepam, and alcohol, was a major factor in the increase in drug-related deaths in Glasgow and Edinburgh in 1990-1992.<ref name="pmid7663317">{{cite journal |author=Hammersley R, Cassidy MT, Oliver J |title=Drugs associated with drug-related deaths in Edinburgh and Glasgow, November 1990 to October 1992 |journal=[[Addiction (journal)|Addiction]] |volume=90 |issue=7 |pages=959–65 |year=1995 |pmid=7663317 |doi=10.1046/j.1360-0443.1995.9079598.x |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0965-2140&date=1995&volume=90&issue=7&spage=959|last2=Cassidy |last3=Oliver }}</ref> Temazepam use was particularly associated with violent or disorderly behaviours and contact with the police in a 1997 study of young single homeless people in [[Scotland]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hammersley R, Pearl S |title=Temazepam Misuse, Violence and Disorder  |journal=Addict Res Theory |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=213–22 |year=1997 |doi= 10.3109/16066359709005262|last2=Pearl  }}</ref> The BBC series ''Panorama'' featured an episode titled "Temazepam Wars", dealing with the epidemic of temazepam abuse and directly related crime in [[Paisley, Scotland]].

===Medical research issues===
The ''Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine'' published a paper expressing concerns about benzodiazepine receptor agonist drugs, the benzodiazepines and the [[Z-drugs]] used as [[hypnotics]] in humans. The paper cites a systematic review of the medical literature concerning insomnia medications and states  almost all trials of sleep disorders and drugs are sponsored by the [[pharmaceutical industry]], while this is not the case in general medicine or psychiatry. It cites another study that "found that the odds ratio for finding results favorable to industry in industry-sponsored trials was 3.6 times as high as in non–industry-sponsored studies". Issues discussed regarding industry-sponsored studies include: comparison of a drug to a placebo, but not to an alternative treatment; unpublished studies with unfavorable outcomes; and trials organized around a placebo baseline followed by drug treatment, but not counterbalanced with parallel-placebo-controlled studies. Quoting a 1979 report that too little research into hypnotics was independent of the drug manufacturers, the authors conclude, "the public desperately needs an equipoised assessment of hypnotic benefits and risks" and  the NIH and VA should provide leadership to that end.<ref>{{cite journal | journal=Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine | date=December 15, 2007 | volume=3 | issue=7 | pages=671–3 | title=Who should sponsor sleep disorders pharmaceutical trials? | author=Kripke DF | pmid=18198797 |pmc=2556906  | quote=NIH or VA sponsorship of major hypnotic trials is needed to more carefully study potential adverse effects of hypnotics such as daytime impairment, infection, cancer, and death and the resultant balance of benefits and risks.}}</ref>

N-oxides are prone to undergo the [[Polonovski reaction|Polonovski rearrangement]] when treated with [[acetic anhydride]], and this was illustrated by the synthesis of [[oxazepam]]. It is not surprising that the N-methyl analogue ('''1''') also undergoes this process, and hydrolysis of the resulting acetate gives temazepam ('''2'''). Care must be exacted with the conditions, or the inactive rearrangement product ('''3''') results.
