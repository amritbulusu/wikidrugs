==History==

===Early history===
In 1867, the Mallinckrodt brothers, Gustav, Otto and Edward, founded G. Mallinckrodt & Co. in St. Louis, Missouri.<ref name=MallinckPapers>{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = SHSMO-St. Louis s0452 Mallinckrodt, Edward Jr. (1878–1967) | url = http://shs.umsystem.edu/stlouis/manuscripts/s0452.pdf | publisher =State Historical Society of Missouri  | date =  | accessdate = 5 February 2015 }}</ref> The Mallinckrodt family had immigrated from Germany, and Otto and Edward both returned to Germany, the leader in chemistry at the time, for advanced training.<ref>Mercelis, Joris. [http://www.immigrantentrepreneurship.org/entry.php?rec=231 "Edward Mallinckrodt Sr."] In ''Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present'', vol. 3, edited by Giles R. Hoyt. German Historical Institute. Last modified March 10, 2015.</ref> Mallinckrodt Chemical Works was incorporated 15 years later. By 1898, the company had established itself as a pharmaceuticals supplier and in 1913 became the first to introduce [[barium sulfate]] as a [[contrast medium]] for x-rays.<ref name=MallinckPapers/> 

In part due to early success in production of radiology agents, and at the behest of surgeon [[Evarts Ambrose Graham|Evarts Graham]], Edward Mallinckrodt Sr. assigned one of the company's top chemists to collaborate in developing the first radiographic agent for [[Cholecystography|gallbladder and bile duct imaging]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Evens|first=Ronald G.|date=2009-01-07|title=Roentgenologic Examination of the Gallbladder (Cholecystography)|url=http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/183146|journal=JAMA|volume=301|issue=1|pages=100–101|doi=10.1001/jama.2008.893|issn=0098-7484}}</ref> A posthumous endowment by Edward Mallinckrodt Jr. on behalf of his father to the [[Washington University School of Medicine|Washington University medical school]] radiology department resulted in the creation of the [[Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology]].<ref>{{cite web|title=S0452  Mallinckrodt, Edward Jr. (1878–1967) Papers, 1798–1981|url=http://shsmo.org/manuscripts/stlouis/s0452.pdf|website=State Historical Society of Missouri: Manuscripts|publisher=State Historical Society of Missouri|accessdate=23 April 2017|page=2}}</ref>

===Nuclear waste in St. Louis, Missouri===
Henry Farr and John Ruhoff, technical managers for Mallinckrodt, Inc. were directed by Edward Mallinckrodt Jr. to develop a chemical process for purifying large quantities of [[uranium]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Tribute to Mallinckrodt Uranium Workers|url=http://www.lm.doe.gov/Weldon/Interpretive_Center/Online_Tour/Tribute_to_the_Mallinckrodt_Uranium_Workers.pdf|website=Department of Energy|accessdate=5 February 2015}}</ref> Uranium purified by Mallinckrodt was used at the [[University of Chicago]] [[Chicago Pile-1]], the first nuclear chain reaction. Mallinckrodt also contributed uranium to the [[Manhattan Project]], producing fissionable materials used in the atomic weapons detonated over [[Little Boy|Hiroshima]] and [[Fat Man|Nagasaki]].

It is that field and the 61-acre park across the street that the Government is considering for a permanent storage site. }}</ref> The dumping substantially contaminated Coldwater Creek.
	
Cleanup efforts are now{{when|date=July 2017}} underway by the Army Corps of Engineers.<ref>{{cite web|title=US Army Corps of Engineers FUSRAP|url=http://www.mvs.usace.army.mil/Missions/CentersofExpertise/FormerlyUtilizedSitesRemedialActionProgram.aspx|website=US Army Corps of Engineers - St. Louis Region|accessdate=5 January 2015}}</ref> Cleanup sites include the St. Louis Downtown Site (SLDS), where uranium was refined; the St. Louis Airport Site (SLAPS), where waste produced at SLDS was stored; the Hazelwood Interim Storage Site (HISS), where waste from SLAPS was relocated; and the St. Louis Airport Site Vicinity Properties (SLAPS VPs), areas where contamination was caused by relocation of waste. Additional nuclear waste was also deposited at the [[West Lake Landfill]], which has now{{when|date=July 2017}} been designated a [[Superfund]] site. Various buildings have been decontaminated and demolished and nuclear material has been excavated and shipped out of St. Louis by covered rail as part of the cleanup process, yet more nuclear waste remains in and around St. Louis.
