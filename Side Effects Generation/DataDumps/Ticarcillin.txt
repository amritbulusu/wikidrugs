'''Ticarcillin''' is a [[carboxypenicillin]]. It is almost invariably{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} sold and used in combination with [[clavulanate]] as '''[[Ticarcillin/clavulanic acid|Timentin]]'''. Because it is a penicillin, it also falls within the larger class of [[beta-lactam]] antibiotics. Its main clinical use is as an injectable antibiotic for the treatment of [[Gram-negative]] bacteria, particularly ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''. It is also one of the few antibiotics capable of treating ''[[Stenotrophomonas maltophilia]]'' infections.

It is provided as a white or pale-yellow powder. It is highly soluble in water, but should be dissolved only immediately before use to prevent degradation.

== Mechanism of action ==
Ticarcillin's antibiotic properties arise from its ability to prevent cross-linking of [[peptidoglycan]] during [[cell wall]] synthesis, when the bacteria try to [[Binary fission|divide]], causing cell death.

Ticarcillin, like [[penicillin]], contains a β-lactam ring that can be cleaved by [[beta-lactamase]]s, resulting in inactivation of the antibiotic. Those bacteria that can express β-lactamases are, therefore, resistant to β-lactam antibiotics. Due, at least in part, to the common β-lactam ring, ticarcillin can cause reactions in patients allergic to penicillin. Ticarcillin is also often paired with a [[beta-lactamase inhibitor|&beta;-lactamase inhibitor]] such as [[clavulanic acid]] ([[co-ticarclav]]).

==Other uses==
In [[molecular biology]], ticarcillin is used to as an alternative to [[ampicillin]] to test the uptake of [[marker gene]]s into bacteria. It prevents the appearance of satellite colonies that occur when ampicillin breaks down in the medium. It is also used in plant molecular biology to kill ''[[Agrobacterium]]'', which is used to deliver genes to plant cells.

== Dosing and administration ==
Ticarcillin is not absorbed orally, so must be given by intravenous or intramuscular injection.

== Trade names and preparations ==
* Ticarcillin: Ticar was formerly marketed by [[Beecham (pharmaceutical company)|Beecham]], then [[SmithKline Beecham]] until 1999, when it merged with Glaxo to form [[GlaxoSmithKline]]; it is no longer available in the UK. US distribution ceased in 2004. Ticar was replaced by Timentin. 
However Timentin contains clavulanate unlike Ticar
* [[Ticarcillin/clavulanate]]: Timentin, in Australia, the UK, and the US, was marketed by Beecham, then GlaxoSmithKline.

==Synthesis==
[[Carbenicillin]] is used in the clinic primarily because of its low toxicity and its utility in treating [[urinary tract infections]] due to susceptible [[Pseudomonas]] species. Its low potency, low oral activity, and susceptibility to bacterial [[beta-lactamases]] make it vulnerable to replacement by agents without these deficits. One contender in this race is ticaricillin. Its origin depended on the well-known fact that a divalent sulfur is roughly equivalent to a vinyl group (cf [[methiopropamine]], [[sufentanil]], [[pizotyline]] etc.).
[[File:Ticarcillin synthesis.svg|thumb|center|700px|Ticarcillin synthesis: GEORGE BRAIN EDWARD, CHARLES NAYLER JOHN HERBERT; {{Cite patent|BE|646991}} (1964 to [[Beecham]]).]]
One synthesis began by making the monobenzyl ester of 3-Thienylmalonic acid, converting this to the acid chloride with SOCl2, and condensing it with 6-Aminopenicillanic acid ([[6-APA]]). Hydrogenolysis (Pd/C) completed the synthesis of ticarcillin.
