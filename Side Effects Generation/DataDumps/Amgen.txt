==Timeline==
*1980. William Bowes from Cetus Corporation recruits Winston Salser from UCLA to start Amgen with a scientific advisory board consisting of [[Norman Davidson (biologist)|Normam Davidson]], [[Leroy Hood]], [[Arnold Berk]], [[John Carbon]], [[Robert Schimke]], [[Arno Motulsky]], [[Marvin H.
