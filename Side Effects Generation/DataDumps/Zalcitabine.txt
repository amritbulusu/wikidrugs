'''Zalcitabine''' (2′-3′-di[[deoxycytidine]], '''ddC'''), also called dideoxycytidine, is a nucleoside analog [[reverse transcriptase inhibitor]] (NRTI) sold under the trade name '''Hivid'''. Zalcitabine was the third antiretroviral to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of [[HIV/AIDS]]. It is used as part of a [[combination therapy|combination regimen]].

Zalcitabine appears less potent than some other nucleoside RTIs, has an inconvenient three-times daily frequency and is associated with serious adverse events. For these reasons it is now rarely used to treat human immunodeficiency virus ([[HIV]]), and it has even been removed from pharmacies entirely in some countries.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

==History==
Zalcitabine was first synthesized in the 1960s by [[Jerome Horwitz]]<ref>{{cite journal |title=Nucleosides. IX. The formation of 2′,3′-unsaturated pyrimidine nucleosides via a novel β-elimination reaction |authors=J. P. Horwitz, J Chua, M DaRooge |journal=Journal of Organic Chemistry |volume=31 |pages=205–211 |year=1966 |pmid=5900814 |doi=10.1021/jo01339a045|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>Oral account of the history of [[Zidovudine|AZT]], [[Stavudine|d4T]] and ddC by [[Jerome Horwitz]] and [[Hiroaki Mitsuya]] in the documentary film [http://www.detourshenry.eu/en/azt.html I am alive today - History of an AIDS drug].</ref> and subsequently developed as an anti-HIV agent by [[Samuel Broder]], [[Hiroaki Mitsuya]], and [[Robert Yarchoan]] at the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI). Like [[didanosine]], it was then licensed because the NCI may not market or sell drugs. The [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) thus licensed it to [[Hoffmann-La Roche]].

Zalcitabine was the third antiretroviral to be approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. It was approved on June 19, 1992 as a monotherapy and again in 1996 for use in combination with [[zidovudine]] (AZT). Using combinations of NRTIs was in practice prior to the second FDA approval and the triple drug combinations with dual NRTIs and a [[protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitor]] (PI) were not far off by this time.

The sale and distribution of zalcitabine has been discontinued since December 31, 2006.<ref name="hividletter">[http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DrugSafety/DrugShortages/ucm086099.pdf HIVID (zalcitabine) tablets. Dear Health Care Professional Letter. (June 2006)]</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
Zalcitabine is an [[analog (chemistry)|analog]] of [[pyrimidine]]. It is a derivative of the naturally existing deoxy[[cytidine]], made by replacing the [[hydroxyl]] group in position 3' with a [[hydrogen]].

It is phosphorylated in [[T cell]]s and other HIV target cells into its active triphosphate form, ddCTP.  This active metabolite works as a substrate for HIV  [[reverse transcriptase]], and also by incorporation into the viral DNA, hence terminating the [[chain elongation]] due to the missing hydroxyl group.  Since zalcitabine is a [[reverse transcriptase]] inhibitor it possesses activity only against [[retrovirus]]es.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Zalcitabine has a very high oral absorption rate of over 80%. It is predominantly eliminated by the renal route, with a half-life of 2 hours.<ref name="hividpi">[http://www.rocheusa.com/products/hivid/pi.pdf HIVID (zalcitabine) tablets. Product information. (September 2002)]</ref>

==Drug interactions==
[[Lamivudine]] (3TC) significantly inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of zalcitabine to the active form, and accordingly the drugs should not be administered together.<ref name="hividpi" />

Additionally, zalcitabine should not be used with other drugs that can cause peripheral [[neuropathy]], such as [[didanosine]] and [[stavudine]].<ref name="hividpi" />

==Adverse events==
The most common adverse events at the beginning of treatment are nausea and headache. More serious adverse events are [[peripheral neuropathy]], which can occur in up to 33% of patients with advanced disease, [[Mouth ulcer|oral ulcers]], [[oesophagitis|oesophageal ulcers]] and, rarely, [[pancreatitis]].<ref name="hividpi" />

==Resistance==
Resistance to zalcitabine develops infrequently compared with other nRTIs, and generally only occurs at a low level.<ref name="Moyle">{{cite journal | author = Moyle GJ | year = 1996 | title = Use of viral resistance patterns to antiretroviral drugs in optimising selection of drug combinations and sequences | url = | journal = Drugs | volume = 52 | issue = | pages = 168–185 | doi=10.2165/00003495-199652020-00002}}</ref> The most common mutation observed ''in vivo'' is T69D, which does not appear to give rise to cross-resistance to other nRTIs; mutations at positions 65, 74, 75, 184 and 215 in the ''pol'' gene are observed more rarely.<ref name="hividpi" /><ref name="Moyle" />

In 1992 dideoxycytidine was listed as a [[specialty drugs|specialty drug]].<ref name="Austria_1992">{{cite journal | title=New, in Austria registered specialty drugs.
