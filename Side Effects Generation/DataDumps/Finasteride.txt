==Medical uses==

===Prostate enlargement===
Physicians sometimes use finasteride for the treatment of BPH, informally known as an enlarged [[prostate]]. Finasteride may improve the symptoms associated with BPH such as difficulty urinating, getting up during the night to urinate, hesitation at the start of urination, and decreased urinary flow.  It provides less symptomatic relief than alpha-1 blockers such as [[tamsulosin]] and symptomatic relief is slower in onset (six months or more of treatment with finasteride may be required to determine the therapeutic results of treatment). Symptomatic benefits are mainly seen in those with prostate volume > 40&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup>. In long-term studies finasteride but not alpha-1 inhibitors reduce the risk of acute urinary retention (−57% at 4 years) and the need for surgery (−54% at 4 years). If the drug is discontinued, any therapeutic benefits reverse within about 6–8 months.<ref name=Cochrane2010>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tacklind J, Fink HA, Macdonald R, Rutks I, Wilt TJ | title = Finasteride for benign prostatic hyperplasia | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 10 | pages = CD006015 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20927745 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006015.pub3 }}</ref><ref name=ProscarLabel>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2010/020180s037lbl.pdf Proscar label]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://uroweb.org/guideline/treatment-of-non-neurogenic-male-luts/ |title=Treatment of Non-neurogenic Male LUTS &#124; Uroweb |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

====Transgender women====
Finasteride is sometimes used in [[hormone replacement therapy (male-to-female)|hormone replacement therapy]] for [[transgender women]] due to its [[antiandrogen]] properties, in combination with a form of [[estrogen]] . However, little [[clinical trial|clinical research]] of finasteride use for this purpose has been conducted and evidence of efficacy is limited.<ref name=TranssexualMgmnt2012>{{cite journal | vauthors = Knezevich EL, Viereck LK, Drincic AT | title = Medical management of adult transsexual persons | journal = Pharmacotherapy | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 54–66 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22392828 | doi = 10.1002/PHAR.1006 }}</ref> Moreover, caution has been recommended when prescribing finasteride to transgender women, as finasteride may be associated with side effects such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, symptoms that are particularly prevalent in the transgender population and in others at high risk already.<ref name="Trüeb2017">{{cite journal|last1=Trüeb|first1=Ralph M.|title=Discriminating in favour of or against men with increased risk of finasteride-related side effects?|journal=Experimental Dermatology|year=2017|pmid=27489125|issn=0906-6705|doi=10.1111/exd.13155|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/exd.13155/full|quote="[...] caution is recommended while prescribing oral finasteride to male-to-female transsexuals, as the drug has been associated with inducing depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation, symptoms that are particularly common in patients with gender dysphoria, who are already at a high risk.[9]"}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
A 2010 Cochrane review concluded that side effects from finasteride are rare when used for BPH.<ref name=Cochrane2010/> Compared with placebo, men taking finasteride are, however, at increased risk for impotence, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorder for the first year of treatment.<ref name=Cochrane2010/> In this review the rates of these effects became indistinguishable from placebo after 2–4 years and these side effects usually got better over time.<ref name=Cochrane2010/> Another 2010 review found that when used for hair loss finasteride increased rates of sexual problems.<ref name="Mella JM 2010">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mella JM, Perret MC, Manzotti M, Catalano HN, Guyatt G | title = Efficacy and safety of finasteride therapy for androgenetic alopecia: a systematic review | journal = Archives of Dermatology | volume = 146 | issue = 10 | pages = 1141–50 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20956649 | doi = 10.1001/archdermatol.2010.256 }}</ref> A 2016 review of 5α-reductase inhibitors for prostatic hyperplasia found that sexual dysfunction was 2.5 times more likely in those who used them.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu L, Zhao S, Li F, Li E, Kang R, Luo L, Luo J, Wan S, Zhao Z | title = Effect of 5α-Reductase Inhibitors on Sexual Function: A Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials | journal = The Journal of Sexual Medicine | volume = 13 | issue = 9 | pages = 1297–310 | date = September 2016 | pmid = 27475241 | doi = 10.1016/j.jsxm.2016.07.006 }}</ref>

A 2015 meta analysis found that none of the clinical trials testing finasteride in hair loss had adequate safety reporting and did not provide sufficient information to establish the safety profile for finasteride as a treatment for hair loss. The study concluded the existing clinical trials of finasteride for hair loss provide very limited information on toxicity, are of poor quality, and seem to be systematically biased toward under-detection of adverse events. Moreover, the trials submitted to the FDA for approval for hair loss excluded most men who would normally be prescribed finasteride for androgenic alopecia.<ref name=Belknapp>{{cite journal | vauthors = Belknap SM, Aslam I, Kiguradze T, Temps WH, Yarnold PR, Cashy J, Brannigan RE, Micali G, Nardone B, West DP | title = Adverse Event Reporting in Clinical Trials of Finasteride for Androgenic Alopecia: A Meta-analysis | journal = JAMA Dermatology | volume = 151 | issue = 6 | pages = 600–6 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25830296 | doi = 10.1001/jamadermatol.2015.36 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Moore TJ | title = Finasteride and the Uncertainties of Establishing Harms | journal = JAMA Dermatology | volume = 151 | issue = 6 | pages = 585–6 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25831198 | doi = 10.1001/jamadermatol.2015.37 }}</ref>

===Sexual dysfunction===
Whether finasteride causes long-term sexual dysfunction in some men after stopping drug treatment is unclear.<ref name=Belknapp/> There are [[case reports]] of persistent diminished libido or erectile dysfunction after stopping the drug and the FDA has updated the label to inform people of these reports.<ref name=2014AArev/><ref>{{cite web | author=FDA | date=11 April 2012 | url = http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/InformationbyDrugClass/ucm299754.htm | title=Questions and Answers: Finasteride Label Changes | publisher=US FDA | accessdate=26 October 2014}}</ref> A 2010 review found moderate quality evidence that finasteride increased the risk of sexual dysfunction, but not that people stopped using it because of sexual side effects.<ref name="Mella JM 2010"/>

==Mechanism of action==
Finasteride is a [[5α-reductase inhibitor]], specifically the [[SRD5A2|type II]] and [[SRD5A3|III]] [[isoenzyme]]s.<ref name="Yamana2010" /><ref name="pmid19879888">{{cite journal | vauthors = Aggarwal S, Thareja S, Verma A, Bhardwaj TR, Kumar M | title = An overview on 5alpha-reductase inhibitors | journal = Steroids | volume = 75 | issue = 2 | pages = 109–53 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19879888 | doi = 10.1016/j.steroids.2009.10.005 }}</ref> By inhibiting 5α-reductase, finasteride prevents conversion of testosterone to [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT) by the type II and III isoenzymes, resulting in a decrease in serum DHT levels by about 65–70% and in prostate DHT levels by up to 85–90%,<ref name="Yamana2010" /><ref name="pmid10765065">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bartsch G, Rittmaster RS, Klocker H | title = Dihydrotestosterone and the concept of 5alpha-reductase inhibition in human benign prostatic hyperplasia | journal = European Urology | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 367–80 | date = April 2000 | pmid = 10765065 | doi = 10.1159/000020181 }}</ref> where [[gene expression|expression]] of the type II isoenzyme predominates. Unlike triple inhibitors of all three isoenzymes of 5α-reductase like [[dutasteride]] which can reduce DHT levels in the entire body by more than 99%,<ref name="Yamana2010" /> finasteride does not completely suppress DHT production because it lacks significant inhibitory effects on the [[SRD5A1|5α-reductase type I]] isoenzyme, with 100-fold less affinity for I as compared to II.<ref name=PropeciaLabel/>

By blocking DHT production, finasteride reduces androgen activity in the scalp. In the prostate, inhibition of 5α-reductase reduces prostate volume, which improves BPH and reduces risk of prostate cancer.

==History==
In 1942, James Hamilton observed that prepubertal castration prevents the later development of male pattern baldness in mature men.<ref>Hamilton J. 1942. Male hormone stimulation is prerequisite and an incitant in common baldness. American Journal of Anatomy 71(3):451–480 DOI 10.1002/aja.1000710306.</ref> In 1974, Julianne Imperato-McGinley of Cornell Medical College in New York attended a conference on birth defects. She reported on a group of [[intersex]] children in the [[Caribbean]] who appeared sexually [[Ambiguity|ambiguous]] at birth, and were initially raised as girls, but then grew external male genitalia and other masculine characteristic after onset of puberty. Her research group found these children shared a [[genetic mutation]], causing [[5-alpha-reductase deficiency|deficiency of the 5α-reductase enzyme]] and male hormone [[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT), which was found to have been the etiology behind abnormalities in male sexual development. Upon maturation, these individuals were observed to have smaller prostates which were underdeveloped, and were also observed to lack incidence of male pattern baldness.<ref name="pmid4432067">{{cite journal | vauthors = Imperato-McGinley J, Guerrero L, Gautier T, Peterson RE | title = Steroid 5alpha-reductase deficiency in man: an inherited form of male pseudohermaphroditism | journal = Science | volume = 186 | issue = 4170 | pages = 1213–5 | date = December 1974 | pmid = 4432067 | doi = 10.1126/science.186.4170.1213 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | first1 = Anna H | last1 = Isfort | first2 = Jill E | last2 = Emerick | first3 = Rachael A | last3 = Paz | name-list-format = vanc | series = News & Perspective  Drugs & Diseases  CME & Education  Academy  Consult, Drugs & Diseases > Pediatrics: General Medicine | title = 5-Alpha-Reductase Deficiency | date = 11 November 2016 | work = WebMD | url = http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/924291-overview#showall }}</ref>

In 1975, copies of Imperato-McGinley's presentation were seen by [[P. Roy Vagelos]], who was then serving as Merck's basic-research chief. He was intrigued by the notion that decreased levels of DHT led to the development of smaller prostates. Dr. Vagelos then sought to create a drug which could mimic the condition found in these children to treat older men who were suffering from benign prostatic hyperplasia.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/16/business/keeping-the-pipeline-filled-at-merck.html?src=pm | work=The New York Times | first=Milt | last=Freudenheim | name-list-format = vanc | title=Keeping the Pipeline Filled at Merck | date=February 16, 1992}}</ref>

Finasteride was developed under the code name MK-906.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} In 1992, finasteride (5&nbsp;mg) was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for treatment of BPH, which Merck marketed under the brand name Proscar.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} In 1997, Merck was successful in obtaining FDA approval for a second indication of finasteride (1&nbsp;mg) for treatment of MPB, which was marketed under the brand name Propecia.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
