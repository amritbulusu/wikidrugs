'''Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus''''' ('''MRSA''') ({{IPAc-en|ɛ|m|ɑr|ɛ|s|eɪ}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɜr|s|ə}}) is a [[gram-positive bacteria|gram-positive bacterium]] that is genetically different from other strains of ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''. MRSA is responsible for several difficult-to-treat [[infection]]s in humans. MRSA is any strain of S. aureus that has developed, through [[horizontal gene transfer]] and [[Evolution#Natural selection|natural selection]], [[multiple drug resistance]] to [[beta-lactam antibiotics]]. β-lactam antibiotics are a [[broad-spectrum antibiotic|broad spectrum group]] which includes some [[penam]]s – [[penicillin]] derivatives such as [[methicillin]] and [[oxacillin]], and [[cephem]]s such as the [[cephalosporin]]s.<ref name = CochraneSurg2013/> Strains unable to resist these antibiotics are classified as methicillin-susceptible ''Staphylococcus aureus'', or MSSA.

MRSA is prevalent in hospitals, prisons, and nursing homes, where people with open [[wound]]s, invasive devices such as [[catheter]]s, and weakened [[immune system]]s are at greater risk of nosocomial infection ([[hospital-acquired infection]]). MRSA began as a hospital-acquired infection, but has developed limited [[endemic]] status and is now community-acquired as well as livestock-acquired. The terms '''HA-MRSA''' (healthcare-associated or hospital-acquired MRSA), '''CA-MRSA''' (community-associated MRSA) and '''LA-MRSA''' (livestock-associated) reflect this distinction.

==Microbiology==
Like all ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' (usually ''S. aureus'' but abbreviated SA at times), methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (MRSA) is a [[gram-positive]], spherical ([[coccus]]) [[bacterium]] that is about 1 [[micron]] in [[diameter]]. It does not form [[Endospore|spores]] and it is non-[[Motility|motile]]. It forms grape-like clusters or chains.<ref name=Murray>{{cite book | last = Murray | first = Patrick | title = Manual of clinical microbiology | publisher = ASM Press | location = Washington, D.C | year = 2007 | isbn = 9781555813710}}</ref>{{rp|390}} Unlike Methicillin-susceptible ''Staphylococcus aureus'' MSSA, MRSA is slower growing on a variety of media and has been found to exist in mixed colonies of MSSA. The mecA gene, which confers the resistance to a number of antibiotics is present in MRSA and not in MSSA. In some instances, the mecA gene is present in MSSA but is not expressed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is the most precise method in identifying MRSA strains. Specialized culture media have been developed to better differentiate between MSSA and MRSA and in some cases, it will identify specific strains that are resistant to different antibiotics.<ref name=Murray/>{{rp|402}} Other strains of ''S. aureus '' have emerged that are resistant to oxacillin, clindamycin, teicoplanin, and erythromycin. These resistant strains may or may not possess the mecA gene. ''S. aureus '' has also developed resistance to [[vancomycin]] (VRSA). One strain is only partially susceptible to vancomycin and is called vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA).<!--not the credit card--> GISA is a strain of resistant S. aureus and stands for glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus and is less suspectible to vancomycin and teicoplanin. Resistance to antibiotics in S. aureus can be quantified. This done by determining the amount of the antibiotic in micrograms/milliliter must be used to inhibit growth. If S. aureus is inhibited at a concentration of vancomycin of less than or equal to 4 micrograms/milliliter, it is said to be susceptible. If a concentration of  greater than 32 micrograms/milliliter is necessary to inhibit growth, it is said to be resistant.<!--note that MRSA can be resistant to vancomycin as well as can VRSA--><ref name=Winn>{{cite book | last = Winn | first = Washington | title = Koneman's color atlas and textbook of diagnostic microbiology | publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | location = Philadelphia | year = 2006 | isbn = 0781730147 }}</ref>{{rp|637}}

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Mrsa2.jpg|thumb|MRSA presents as small red bumps on the skin that become filled with pus.]]

After 72 hours, MRSA can take hold in human tissues and eventually become resistant to treatment. The initial presentation of MRSA is small red bumps that resemble pimples, spider bites, or boils; they may be accompanied by fever and, occasionally, rashes. Within a few days, the bumps become larger and more painful; they eventually open into deep, pus-filled boils. About 75 percent of CA-MRSA infections are localized to skin and soft tissue and usually can be treated effectively.<ref name=IDSA2011/>

===Hospitalized people===
People who are hospitalized, including the elderly, are often immunocompromised and susceptible to infection of all kinds, including MRSA; when the infection is by MRSA this is called healthcare-associated or hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (HA-MRSA).<ref name= CochraneSurg2013/><ref name=CochraneNonSurg2013>{{cite journal|last1=Gurusamy|first1=KS|last2=Koti|first2=R|last3=Toon|first3=CD|last4=Wilson|first4=P|last5=Davidson|first5=BR|title=Antibiotic therapy for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in non surgical wounds.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=18 November 2013|issue=11|pages=CD010427|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010427.pub2|pmid=24242704}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jacobs|first1=A|title=Hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: status and trends.|journal=Radiologic technology|date=2014|volume=85|issue=6|pages=623–48; quiz 649–52|pmid=25002642}}</ref><ref name = Sga2016/>

===Prison inmates, military recruits===
Prisons, and military barracks,<ref name = Gopal2017/> can be crowded and confined, and poor hygiene practices may proliferate, thus putting inhabitants at increased risk of contracting MRSA.<ref name=cmr/> Cases of MRSA in such populations were first reported in the United States, and then in Canada. The earliest reports were made by the [[Center for Disease Control]] (CDC) in US state prisons. In the news media, hundreds of reports of MRSA outbreaks in prisons appeared between 2000 and 2008. For example, in February 2008, the [[Tulsa County]] jail in [[Oklahoma]] started treating an average of 12 ''S. aureus'' cases per month.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.purebio.com/about/article/48|title=PURE Bioscience|work=purebio.com}}</ref> A report on skin and soft tissue infections in the [[Cook County]] jail in Chicago in 2004–05 demonstrated MRSA was the most common cause of these infections among cultured lesions, and few risk factors were more strongly associated with MRSA infections than infections caused by methicillin-susceptible'' S. aureus''. In response to these and many other reports on MRSA infections among incarcerated and recently incarcerated persons, the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] has released guidelines for the management and control of the infections, although few studies provide an evidence base for these guidelines. During a recent study in Fort Benning Georgia, a variety of military recruits both healthy and those suffering from soft tissue infections were tested for MRSA as well as other pathogens.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Jatinder|last2=Johnson|first2=Ryan C.|last3=Schlett|first3=Carey D.|last4=Elassal|first4=Emad M.|last5=Crawford|first5=Katrina B.|last6=Mor|first6=Deepika|last7=Lanier|first7=Jeffrey B.|last8=Law|first8=Natasha N.|last9=Walters|first9=William A.|date=2016-10-26|title=Multi-Body-Site Microbiome and Culture Profiling of Military Trainees Suffering from Skin and Soft Tissue Infections at Fort Benning, Georgia|url=http://msphere.asm.org/content/1/5/e00232-16|journal=mSphere|language=en|volume=1|issue=5|pages=e00232–16|doi=10.1128/mSphere.00232-16|issn=2379-5042|pmc=5064451|pmid=27747300}}</ref> The researchers determined that a significant portion of trainees were either asymptomatic carriers of MRSA or that MRSA was the cause of their infection.<ref name=":2" />

Diagnostic microbiology laboratories and reference laboratories are key for identifying outbreaks of MRSA.  Normally, the bacterium must be cultured from blood, urine, [[sputum]], or other body-fluid samples, and in sufficient quantities to perform confirmatory tests early-on. Still, because no quick and easy method exists to diagnose MRSA, initial treatment of the infection is often based upon 'strong suspicion' and techniques by the treating physician; these include [[quantitative PCR]] procedures, which are employed in clinical laboratories for quickly detecting and identifying MRSA strains.<ref name= FrancoisP>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/staph|vauthors=Francois P, Schrenzel J|year=2008|chapter=Rapid Diagnosis and Typing of ''Staphylococcus aureus''|title=Staphylococcus: Molecular Genetics|publisher=Caister Academic Press |isbn=978-1-904455-29-5}}</ref><ref name=Mackay>{{cite book |editor= Mackay IM |title= Real-Time PCR in Microbiology: From Diagnosis to Characterization |publisher= Caister Academic Press |year= 2007 |url=http://www.horizonpress.com/rtmic |isbn=978-1-904455-18-9}}</ref>

Another common laboratory test is a rapid [[agglutination (biology)|latex agglutination]] test that detects the PBP2a protein. PBP2a is a variant [[penicillin-binding protein]] that imparts the ability of ''S. aureus'' to be resistant to oxacillin.<ref name=Hardy>{{cite web |title=MRSA latex test for PBP2 |first=Denka |last=Seiken |url=http://www.hardydiagnostics.com/catalog2/hugo/MRSALatexTest.htm}}</ref>

==Genetics==
Antimicrobial resistance is genetically based; resistance is mediated by the acquisition of extrachromosomal genetic elements containing resistance genes. Examples include plasmids, transposable genetic elements, and genomic islands, which are transferred between bacteria through [[horizontal gene transfer]].<ref name=jenson1>{{cite journal |vauthors=Jensen SO, Lyon BR |title=Genetics of antimicrobial resistance in ''Staphylococcus aureus'' |journal=Future Microbiol |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=565–82 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19492967 |doi=10.2217/fmb.09.30 |url=http://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/abs/10.2217/fmb.09.30?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed}}</ref> A defining characteristic of MRSA is its ability to thrive in the presence of [[penicillin]]-like antibiotics, which normally prevent bacterial growth by inhibiting synthesis of [[cell wall]] material. This is due to a resistance gene, ''mecA'', which stops β-lactam antibiotics from inactivating the enzymes (transpeptidases) critical for cell wall synthesis.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

These distinctions were thoroughly investigated by Collins et al. in 2001 and can be explained by the fitness differences associated with carriage of a large or small SCC''mec'' plasmid. Carriage of large plasmids, such as SCC''mec''I-III, is costly to the bacteria, resulting in compensatory decrease in virulence expression.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=J.|last2=Rudkin|first2=J.|date=2010|title=Offsetting virulence and antibiotic resistance costs by MRSA|journal=International Society for Microbial Ecology|volume=4}}</ref> MRSA is able to thrive in hospital settings with increased antibiotic resistance but decreased virulence- HA-MRSA targets immunocompromised, hospitalized hosts, thus a decrease in virulence is not maladaptive.<ref name=":0" /> In contrast, CA-MRSA tends to carry lower fitness cost SCC''mec'' elements to offset the increased virulence and toxicity expression required to infect healthy hosts.<ref name=":0" />

===''mecA''===
[[MecA (gene)|''mecA'']] is a biomarker gene responsible for resistance to methicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics. After acquisition of ''mecA'', the gene must be integrated and localized in the S. aureus chromosome.<ref name=lowy1/> ''mecA'' encodes penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a), which differs from other penicillin-binding proteins as its active site does not bind methicillin or other β-lactam antibiotics.<ref name=lowy1/> As such, PBP2a can continue to catalyze the transpeptidation reaction required for [[peptidoglycan]] cross-linking, enabling cell wall synthesis in the presence of antibiotics. As a consequence of the inability of PBP2a to interact with β-lactam moieties, acquisition of ''mecA'' confers resistance to all β-lactam antibiotics in addition to methicillin.<ref name=lowy1/><ref>Sahebnasagh R, Saderi H, Owlia P.

''mecA'' is under the control of two [[regulatory genes]], ''mecI'' and ''mecR1''. MecI is usually bound to the ''mecA'' promoter and functions as a repressor.<ref name=jenson1/><ref name=monaco1/> In the presence of a β-lactam antibiotic, MecR1 initiates a [[signal transduction cascade]] that leads to transcriptional activation of ''mecA''.<ref name=jenson1/><ref name=monaco1/> This is achieved by MecR1-mediated cleavage of MecI, which alleviates MecI repression.<ref name=jenson1/> ''mecA'' is further controlled by two co-repressors, BlaI and BlaR1.

==Prevention==

===Screening ===
In health care settings, isolating those with MRSA from those without the infection, is one method to prevent transmission. Rapid culture and sensitivity testing and molecular testing identifies carriers and reduces infection rates.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Tacconelli E, De Angelis G, de Waure C, Cataldo MA, La Torre G, Cauda R |title= Rapid screening tests for meticillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' at hospital admission: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal= Lancet Infect Dis |volume= 9 |issue= 9 |pages= 546–54 |date= September 2009 |pmid= 19695491 |doi= 10.1016/S1473-3099(09)70150-1 |url= http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1473-3099(09)70150-1}}</ref>

MRSA can be identified by swabbing the nostrils and isolating the bacteria found inside the nostrils. Combined with extra sanitary measures for those in contact with infected people, swab screening people admitted to hospitals has been found to be effective in minimizing the spread of MRSA in hospitals in the [[United States]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], and the [[Netherlands]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tufts.edu/med/apua/Patients/ridbooklet.pdf |title=Unnecessary Deaths: The Human and Financial Costs of Hospital Infections |accessdate=2007-08-05 |edition=2nd|author=McCaughey B|format=PDF |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070711030535/http://www.tufts.edu/med/apua/Patients/ridbooklet.pdf |archivedate= July 11, 2007}}</ref>

<!--===Surface sanitizing===
Complete surface sanitation is necessary to eliminate MRSA in areas where people are recovering from invasive procedures. Testing people for MRSA upon admission, isolating MRSA-positive people, decolonization of MRSA-positive people, and [[terminal cleaning]] of rooms and all other clinical areas occupied by MRSA-positive people is the current best practice protocol for nosocomial MRSA.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}-->

===Hand washing===
The CDC offers suggestions for preventing the contraction and spread MRSA infection which are applicable to those in community settings, including incarcerated populations, childcare center employees, and athletes. To prevent the spread of MRSA the recommendations are to wash hands using soap and water or an alcohol-based sanitizer. Additional recommendations are to  keep wounds clean and covered, avoid contact with other people's wounds, avoid sharing personal items such as razors or towels, shower after exercising at athletic facilities, and shower before using swimming pools or whirlpools.<ref>{{cite web |title= Personal Prevention of MRSA Skin Infections |publisher= CDC |accessdate = 25 May 2017 |date= 9 August 2010 |url= https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/mdro/index.html}}{{CDC}}</ref>

In September 2004, the UK [[National Health Service]] announced its ''Clean Your Hands'' campaign. It was recommended that [[hand sanitizer|alcohol-based hand rubs]] be placed near beds to encourage staff to use the sanitizer more regularly. It was thought that even if this cuts infection by no more than 1%, the plan will pay for itself many times over.<ref>{{cite web |title=NPSA - About us|url=http://www.npsa.nhs.uk/cleanyourhands/about-us/}}</ref>

In addition, surface and equipment sanitizing conforms to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered disinfectants.<ref name="NIOSH_MRSA" /> Health Departments recommend that preventing the spread of MRSA in the home can be to: launder materials that have come into contact with infected person separately and with a dilute bleach solution; reduce the bacterial load in your nose and on your skin; clean those things in the house that people regularly touch like sinks, tubs, kitchen counters, cell phones, light switches, doorknobs, phones, toilets, and computer keyboards.<ref name=tpchd/>

===Restricting antibiotic use===

===Public health considerations===

Mathematical models describe one way in which a loss of infection control can occur after measures for screening and isolation seem to be effective for years, as happened in the UK. In the "search and destroy" strategy that was employed by all UK hospitals until the mid-1990s, all hospitalized people with MRSA were immediately isolated, and all staff were screened for MRSA and were prevented from working until they had completed a course of eradication therapy that was proven to work. Loss of control occurs because colonised people are discharged back into the community and then readmitted; when the number of colonised people in the community reaches a certain threshold, the "search and destroy" strategy is overwhelmed.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cooper BS, Medley GF, Stone SP, Kibbler CC, Cookson BD, Roberts JA, Duckworth G, Lai R, Ebrahim S |title= Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' in hospitals and the community: stealth dynamics and control catastrophes |journal= Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume= 101 |issue= 27 |pages= 10223–8 |year= 2004 |pmid= 15220470 |pmc= 454191 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.0401324101}}</ref> One of the few countries not to have been overwhelmed by MRSA is the [[Netherlands]]: An important part of the success of the Dutch strategy may have been to attempt eradication of carriage upon discharge from hospital.<ref name=bootsma2006>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bootsma MC, Diekmann O, Bonten MJ |title= Controlling methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'': quantifying the effects of interventions and rapid diagnostic testing |journal= Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume= 103 |issue= 14 |pages= 5620–5 |year= 2006 |pmid= 16565219 |pmc= 1459403 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.0510077103}}</ref>

===Infected implants===
MRSA infection can occur associated with implants and joint replacements. Recommendations on treatment are based upon the length of time the implant has been in place. In cases of a recent placement of a surgical implant or artificial joint, the device may be retained while antibiotic therapy continues. If the placement of the device has occurred over 3 weeks ago, the device may be removed. Antibiotic therapy is used in each instance sometimes long-term.<ref name=IDSA2011/>

MRSA can infect the central nervous system and form brain abscess, subdural empyema, and spinal epidural abscess. Excision and drainage can be done along with antibiotic treatment. Septic thrombosis of cavernous or dural venous sinus can sometimes be a complication.<ref name=IDSA2011/>

===Other infections===
Treatment is not standardized for other instances of MRSA infection in a wide range of tissues. Treatment varies for MRSA infections related to: subperiosteal abscesses, necrotizing pneumonia, cellulitis, pyomyositis, necrotizing fasciitis, mediastinitis, myocardial, perinephric, hepatic, and splenic abscesses, septic thrombophlebitis, and severe ocular infections, including endophthalmitis.<ref name=IDSA2011/> Pets can be reservoirs and pass on MRSA to people.

There are concerns that the presence of MRSA in the environment may allow resistance to be transferred to other bacteria through phages (viruses that infect bacteria). The source of MRSA could come from hospital waste, farm sewage, and other waste water.<ref name=IDSA2011/>

===LA-MRSA===
Livestock associated MRSA (LA-MRSA) has been observed in Korea, Brazil, Switzerland, Malaysia, India, Great Britain, Denmark, and China.<ref name = Gopal2017/>

==History==
[[File:EARSS MRSA 2008-en.svg|thumb|Incidence of MRSA in human blood samples in countries which took part in the study in 2008]]

A 1,000-year-old [[collyrium|eye salve]] recipe found in the medieval [[Bald's Leechbook]] at the [[British Library]], one of the earliest known medical textbooks, was found to have activity against MRSA ''in vitro'' and in skin wounds in mice.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Thompson|first1=Nick|last2=Smith-Spark|first2=Laura|title=Thousand-year-old Anglo-Saxon potion kills MRSA superbug|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/03/31/health/anglo-saxon-potion-mrsa/index.html|website=CNN News|publisher=CNN/Time Warner|accessdate=1 April 2015}}</ref>

MRSA was first discovered in 1961 In 1959 - 1961.<ref name= CochraneSurg2013/> In 1961, [[Methicillin]] was licensed in England to treat penicillin-resistant ''S. aureus'' infections. In 1961 the first known MRSA isolates were reported in a British study, and from 1961 to 1967 there were infrequent hospital outbreaks in Western Europe and Australia.<ref name= "The University of Chicago Medical Center">{{cite web |url=http://mrsa-research-center.bsd.uchicago.edu/timeline.html |publisher=The University of Chicago Medical Center |title=MRSA History Timeline: The First Half-Century, 1959-2009 |year=2010}}</ref> Other reports of MRSA began to be described in the 1970s.<ref name = CochraneSurg2013/> Resistance to other antibiotics was documented in some strains of S. aureus. In 1996, vancomycin resistance was reported in Japan.<ref name=Winn/>{{rp|637}} In many countries, outbreaks of MRSA infection was reported to be transmitted between hospitals.<ref name=Murray/>{{rp|402}} The rate had increased to 22% by 1995, and by 1997 the percent of hospital ''S. aureus'' infections attributable to MRSA had reached 50%.

The first report of community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) occurred in 1981, and in 1982 there was a large outbreak of CA-MRSA among intravenous drug users in Detroit, Michigan.<ref name= "The University of Chicago Medical Center"/> Additional outbreaks of CA-MRSA were reported through the 1980s and 1990s, including outbreaks among Australian Aboriginal populations that had never been exposed to hospitals. In the mid-1990s there were scattered reports of CA-MRSA outbreaks among US children. While HA-MRSA rates stabilized between 1998 and 2008, CA-MRSA rates continued to rise. A report released by the University of Chicago Children's Hospital comparing two time periods (1993–1995 and 1995–1997) found a 25-fold increase in the rate of hospitalizations due to MRSA among children in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mrsa-research-center.bsd.uchicago.edu/JAMA_02_25_1998_issue.pdf|title=Community-acquired MRSA in Children with no predisposing risk|publisher=}}</ref> In 1999 the University of Chicago reported the first deaths from invasive MRSA among otherwise healthy children in the United States.<ref name= "The University of Chicago Medical Center"/> By 2004, the genome for various strains of MRSA were described.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Holden MT, Feil EJ, Lindsay JA, Peacock SJ, Day NP, Enright MC, Foster TJ, Moore CE, Hurst L, Atkin R, Barron A, Bason N, Bentley SD, Chillingworth C, Chillingworth T, Churcher C, Clark L, Corton C, Cronin A, Doggett J, Dowd L, Feltwell T, Hance Z, Harris B, Hauser H, Holroyd S, Jagels K, James KD, Lennard N, Line A, Mayes R, Moule S, Mungall K, Ormond D, Quail MA, Rabbinowitsch E, Rutherford K, Sanders M, Sharp S, Simmonds M, Stevens K, Whitehead S, Barrell BG, Spratt BG, Parkhill J |title= Complete genomes of two clinical ''Staphylococcus aureus'' strains: Evidence for the rapid evolution of virulence and drug resistance |journal= Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume= 101 |issue= 26 |pages= 9786–91 |year= 2004 |pmid= 15213324 |pmc= 470752 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.0402521101}}</ref>

It has been argued that the observed increased mortality among MRSA-infected people may be the result of the increased underlying [[morbidity]] of these people. Several studies, however, including one by Blot and colleagues, that have adjusted for underlying disease still found MRSA bacteremia to have a higher attributable mortality than methicillin-susceptible ''S. aureus'' (MSSA) bacteremia.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Blot SI, Vandewoude KH, Hoste EA, Colardyn FA |title= Outcome and attributable mortality in critically Ill patients with bacteremia involving methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' |journal= Arch Intern Med |volume= 162 |issue= 19 |pages= 2229–35 |year= 2002 |pmid= 12390067 |doi= 10.1001/archinte.162.19.2229}}</ref>

A population-based study of the incidence of MRSA infections in [[San Francisco]] during 2004–05 demonstrated that nearly 1 in 300 residents suffered from such an infection in the course of a year and that greater than 85% of these infections occurred outside of the healthcare setting.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Liu C, Graber CJ, Karr M, Diep BA, Basuino L, Schwartz BS, Enright MC, O'Hanlon SJ, Thomas JC, Perdreau-Remington F, Gordon S, Gunthorpe H, Jacobs R, Jensen P, Leoung G, Rumack JS, Chambers HF |title= A population-based study of the incidence and molecular epidemiology of methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' disease in San Francisco, 2004–2005 |journal= Clin.

In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines on October 19, 2006, citing the need for additional research, but declined to recommend such screening.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/pdf/ar/mdroGuideline2006.pdf|title=Healthcare-associated infections - HAI - CDC|work=cdc.gov}}</ref>

According to the CDC, the most recent estimates of the incidence of healthcare-associated infections that are attributable to MRSA in the United States indicate a decline in such infection rates. Incidence of MRSA central line-associated blood stream infections as reported by hundreds of intensive care units decreased 50–70% from 2001–2007.<ref name="mrsa-surveillance">{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mrsa/statistics/MRSA-Surveillance-Summary.html|title=MRSA Surveillance|date=April 8, 2011|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}</ref> A separate system tracking all hospital MRSA bloodstream infections found an overall 34% decrease between 2005–2008.<ref name="mrsa-surveillance"/>

In 2010, vancomycin was the drug of choice.<ref name=IDSA2011/>

==Research==

Various antibacterial chemical extracts from various species of the Sweetgum tree, (genus [[Liquidambar]]) have been investigated for their activity in inhibiting MRSA. Specifically these are: [[cinnamic acid]], [[cinnamyl cinnamate]], [[ethyl cinnamate]], [[benzyl cinnamate]], [[styrene]], [[vanillin]], [[cinnamyl alcohol]], [[2-phenylpropyl alcohol]], [[3-phenylpropyl cinnamate]], and vanillin.<ref name="CrandallLingbeck2015">{{cite journal|last1=Crandall|first1=PhilipG|last2=Lingbeck|first2=JodyM|last3=O′Bryan|first3=CorlissA|last4=Martin|first4=ElizabethM|last5=Adams|first5=JoshuaP|title=Sweetgum: An ancient source of beneficial compounds with modern benefits|journal=Pharmacognosy Reviews|volume=9|issue=17|year=2015|pages=1|issn=0973-7847|doi=10.4103/0973-7847.156307}}</ref>

The delivery of inhaled antibiotics along with systematic administration to treat MRSA are being developed. It's believed that this will improve the outcomes of those with cystic fibrosis and other respiratory infections.<ref name="MaselliKeyt2017"/>
