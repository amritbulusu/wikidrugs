==Side effects==
The side effects of trimipramine have been said to be similar to those of other tertiary amine TCAs, with a preponderance of [[anticholinergic]] and [[sedative]] effects.<ref name="pmid2693051" /> However, trimipramine has also been said to be associated with a different side effect profile compared to other TCAs and in general with fewer side effects, chiefly due to its lack of [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibition]] and relatively lower anticholinergic effects (although it is still a potent anticholinergic).<ref name="pmid2693055" /><ref name="pmid2693051" /> [[Somnolence]] is the most common side effect of the drug.<ref name="pmid2693051" /> [[Dry mouth]] is the most common anticholinergic side effect, but others like [[constipation]], [[urinary retention]], and [[blurred vision]] are also present.<ref name="pmid2693051" />

It is described as being associated with minimal or no [[orthostatic hypotension]], at least in comparison to [[clomipramine]],<ref name="pmid8863001" /><ref name="pmid2693055" /><ref name="pmid8863001" /> in spite of its potent and comparable activity as an [[alpha-1 blocker]].<ref name="pmid6086881" /><ref name="pmid2693051" /> However, it has also been said to have a rate of orthostatic hypotension similar to that of other TCAs.<ref name="pmid2693051" /> Trimipramine is said to be less [[epileptogenic]] than other TCAs, although [[seizure]]s have still been reported in association with it.<ref name="pmid2693055" /> It is also less [[cardiotoxic]] than other TCAs<ref name="pmid2693055" /> and cardiotoxicity is said to be minimal, with a "very favorable profile".<ref name="pmid2693051" />

==Overdose==
{{Main|Tricyclic antidepressant overdose}}

Compared to other TCAs, trimipramine is relatively safe in [[overdose]], although it is more dangerous than the [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs) and [[serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors]] (SNRIs) but less dangerous than [[bupropion]] in cases of overdose.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=White, N |author2=Litovitz, T |author3=Clancy, C | date = December 2008 | title = Suicidal antidepressant overdoses: a comparative analysis by antidepressant type | journal = Journal of Medical Toxicology | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = 238–250 | pmid = 19031375 | pmc = 3550116 | doi = 10.1007/BF03161207 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3550116/pdf/13181_2009_Article_BF03161207.pdf}}</ref>

==Interactions==
Trimipramine should not be given with [[sympathomimetic]] agents such as [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline), [[ephedrine]], [[isoprenaline]], [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline), [[phenylephrine]] and [[phenylpropanolamine]].

[[Barbiturate]]s may increase the rate of [[metabolism]]. Trimipramine should be administered with care in patients receiving therapy for [[hyperthyrodism]].<ref name = TGA/><ref name = DM/><ref name = MSR/><ref name = EMC/><ref name = AMH/><ref name = BNF/>

The [[mechanism of action]] of trimipramine in terms of its antidepressant effects differs from that of other TCAs and is not fully clear.<ref name="pmid21484238" /><ref name="pmid2693052" /> The mechanism of action of its anxiolytic effects is similarly unclear.<ref name="pmid2693052" /> Trimipramine is a very weak [[reuptake inhibitor]] of [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[dopamine]] (see [[#Monoamine reuptake inhibition|below]]),<ref name="pmid21484238" /> and unlike most other TCAs, has been claimed to be devoid of clinically significant [[monoamine reuptake inhibition]].<ref name="pmid9090573" /><ref name="pmid2693055" /><ref name="pmid8863001" /> The effects of the drug are thought to be mainly due to [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonism]] as follows:<ref name="pmid6086881" /><ref name="pmid7855217" /><ref name="pmid3816971" />

* Very strong: [[histamine H1 receptor|H<sub>1</sub>]]
* Strong: [[5-HT2A|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]], [[alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic]]
* Moderate: [[Dopamine receptor D2|D<sub>2</sub>]], [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor|mACh]]
* Weak: [[5-HT2C|5-HT<sub>2C</sub>]], [[dopamine receptor D1|D<sub>1</sub>]], [[alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic]]

In spite of its atypical nature and different profile of activity, trimipramine has been shown in head-to-head clinical studies to possess equivalent effectiveness to other antidepressants, including but not limited to other TCAs (e.g., [[amitriptyline]], [[imipramine]], [[doxepin]], [[amineptine]]), [[tetracyclic antidepressant]]s (TeCAs) (e.g., [[maprotiline]]), [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAOIs) (e.g., [[phenelzine]], [[isocarboxazid]]), and [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (e.g., [[fluoxetine]]).<ref name="pmid8863001" /><ref name="pmid2693055" /> In addition, trimipramine has been found to possess greater [[anxiolytic]] effects than other TCAs such as amitriptyline and doxepin in head-to-head comparisons.<ref name="pmid2693052" /> Indeed, its prominent anxiolytic effects have been said to distinguish it from most other TCAs.<ref name="pmid2693051" /> The atypicality of trimipramine in relation to its lack of monoamine reuptake inhibition is described as challenging the [[Biology of depression#Monoamines|monoamine hypothesis of depression]].<ref name="pmid2693055" />

The major [[metabolite]] of trimipramine, desmethyltrimipramine, is considered to possess pharmacological activity similar to that of other demethylated tertiary amine TCA variants.<ref name="pmid21484238" />

Trimipramine is extensively [[metabolism|metabolized]], so its metabolites may contribute to its pharmacology, including potentially to monoamine reuptake inhibition.<ref name="pmid21484238" /><ref name="pmid24062697">{{cite journal | vauthors = López-Muñoz F, Alamo C | title = Active metabolites as antidepressant drugs: the role of norquetiapine in the mechanism of action of quetiapine in the treatment of mood disorders | journal = Front Psychiatry | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 102 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24062697 | pmc = 3770982 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyt.2013.00102 | url = }}</ref> In what was the only study to date to have assessed the activity profiles of the metabolites of trimipramine, Haenisch et al. (2011) assayed desmethyltrimipramine, 2-hydroxytrimipramine, and trimipramine-N-oxide in addition to trimipramine and found that these metabolites showed IC<sub>50</sub> values for the SERT, NET, and DAT similar to those of trimipramine (see table to the right).<ref name="pmid21484238" /><ref name="pmid24062697" /> Like other secondary amine TCAs, desmethyltrimipramine was slightly more potent than trimipramine in its norepinephrine reuptake inhibition but less potent in its inhibition of serotonin reuptake.<ref name="pmid21484238" /> However, desmethyltrimipramine still showed only very weak inhibition of the NET.<ref name="pmid21484238" />

Therapeutic concentrations of trimipramine are between 0.5 and 1.2&nbsp;μM (150–350&nbsp;ng/mL) and hence significant monoamine reuptake inhibition would not be expected with it or its metabolites.<ref name="pmid21484238" /> However, these concentrations are nearly 2-fold higher if the active metabolites of trimipramine are also considered, and studies of other TCAs have found that they cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] and accumulate in the brain to levels of up to 10-fold those in the periphery.<ref name="pmid21484238" /> As such, trimipramine and its metabolites might at least partially inhibit reuptake of serotonin and/or norepinephrine, though not of dopamine, at therapeutic concentrations, and this could be hypothesized to contribute at least in part to its antidepressant effects.<ref name="pmid21484238" /><ref name="pmid24062697" /> This is relevant as Haenisch et al. has stated that these are the only actions known at present which could explain or at least contribute to the antidepressant effects of trimipramine.<ref name="pmid21484238" /> That said, blockade of the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>, and α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors, as with [[mirtazapine]],<ref name="pmid11607047">{{cite journal | vauthors = Anttila SA, Leinonen EV | title = A review of the pharmacological and clinical profile of mirtazapine | journal = CNS Drug Rev | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 249–64 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11607047 | doi = | url = }}</ref> has also been implicated in antidepressant effects.<ref name="pmid15309042">{{cite journal | vauthors = Celada P, Puig M, Amargós-Bosch M, Adell A, Artigas F | title = The therapeutic role of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors in depression | journal = J Psychiatry Neurosci | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 252–65 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15309042 | pmc = 446220 | doi = | url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid9090573" /><ref name="pmid16433010">{{cite journal | vauthors = Millan MJ | title = Serotonin 5-HT2C receptors as a target for the treatment of depressive and anxious states: focus on novel therapeutic strategies | journal = Therapie | volume = 60 | issue = 5 | pages = 441–60 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16433010 | doi = | url = }}</ref>

In any case, there is also clinical and animal evidence that trimipramine does not inhibit the reuptake of monoamines.<ref name="pmid2693055" /> Unlike other TCAs, it does not [[downregulation|downregulate]] [[beta-3 adrenergic receptor|β<sub>3</sub>-adrenergic receptor]]s, which is likely the reason that it does not cause orthostatic hypotension.<ref name="pmid2693055" /><ref name="pmid8863001" /> It can be safely combined with MAOIs apparently without risk of [[serotonin syndrome]] or [[hypertensive crisis]].<ref name="pmid2693055" /> Indeed, in rabbits, whereas [[hyperpyrexia]] (a symptom of serotonin syndrome) occurs with imipramine and an MAOI and to a lesser extent with amitriptyline and an MAOI, it does not occur at all with trimipramine and an MAOI, likely due to trimipramine's lack of serotonin reuptake inhibition.<ref name="pmid2693055" />

Trimipramine is also an antagonist of the [[H2 receptor|H<sub>2</sub> receptor]] with lower potency and has been found to be effective in the treatment of [[duodenal ulcer]]s.<ref name="pmid2693051" />

Most antidepressants suppress REM sleep, in parallel with their alleviation of depressive symptoms (although suppression of REM sleep is not required for antidepressant effects).<ref name="pmid8863001" /> This includes TCAs (e.g., amitriptyline, [[nortriptyline]]), TeCAs (e.g., [[mianserin]], maprotiline), MAOIs (e.g., [[clorgiline]], [[pargyline]]), and SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine, [[zimelidine]], [[indalpine]]).<ref name="pmid8863001" /> Trimipramine is unique in that it is an exception and produces antidepressant effects without compromising or otherwise affecting REM sleep.<ref name="pmid8863001" /><ref name="pmid2693051" /> Even long-term treatment with trimipramine for up to 2&nbsp;years has not been found to suppress REM sleep.<ref name="pmid2693050">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rüther E | title = Depression, circadian rhythms and trimipramine | journal = Drugs | volume = 38 Suppl 1 | issue = | pages = 1–3; discussion 49–50 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2693050 | doi = | url = }}</ref> In addition, trimipramine has been found to decrease nocturnal [[cortisol]] levels to normal and to normalize cortisol response in depressed patients; hence, it normalizes the [[hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis]], whereas imipramine and other antidepressants tend to increase nocturnal cortisol secretion.<ref name="pmid1663593" />

Trimipramine is a weak but significant antagonist of the dopamine [[D1 receptor|D<sub>1</sub>]] and [[D2 receptor|D<sub>2</sub> receptor]]s, and also binds to the [[D4 receptor|D<sub>4</sub> receptor]] (K<sub>i</sub> = 275&nbsp;nM).<ref name="pmid8863001" /><ref name="pmid21484238" /> Interestingly, its affinities for various [[monoamine receptor]]s including the D<sub>2</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors closely resemble those of the [[atypical antipsychotic]] [[clozapine]].<ref name="pmid8863001" /> In accordance, high doses of trimipramine have been found to have [[antipsychotic]] effects in [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] patients, notably without causing [[extrapyramidal symptoms]], and trimipramine has recently been found to be effective in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients with [[delusional depression]].<ref name="pmid8863001" /><ref name="pmid21484238" /> The lack of extrapyramidal symptoms with trimipramine may be related to its affinity for the D<sub>4</sub> receptor, these both being properties it shares with clozapine.<ref name="pmid1663593" /> Unlike other TCAs, but reminiscent of antipsychotics, trimipramine has been found to markedly increase plasma [[prolactin]] levels (a marker of D<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonism) at a dose of 75&nbsp;mg/day and to increase nocturnal prolactin secretion at doses of 75 and 200&nbsp;mg/day.<ref name="pmid8863001" /> These findings are suggestive of important [[antidopaminergic]] actions of trimipramine.<ref name="pmid8863001" /><ref name="pmid21484238" />

Unlike various other TCAs, trimipramine shows marked antagonism of [[chemical synapse|presynaptic]] [[dopamine]] [[autoreceptor]]s, potentially resulting in increased [[dopaminergic]] [[neurotransmission]].<ref name="pmid2693055" /> This effect has also been observed with low-potency tricyclic antipsychotics like [[thioridazine]] and [[chlorprothixene]].<ref name="pmid2693055" /> Notably, these two antipsychotics have been claimed many times to also possess antidepressant effects.<ref name="pmid2693055" /><ref name="pmid2693050" /> As such, blockade of inhibitory dopamine autoreceptors and hence facilitation of dopaminergic signaling could be involved in the antidepressant effects of trimipramine.<ref name="pmid2693055" /><ref name="pmid2693050" /> However, other authors have attributed the claimed antidepressant effects of antipsychotics like the two previously mentioned to [[alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor]] antagonism, although trimipramine specifically has only weak affinity for this receptor.<ref name="pmid2693055" /> Aside from antidepressant effects, low doses of antipsychotics have been found to increase REM sleep, and so dopamine autoreceptor antagonism could be involved in the unique effects of trimipramine in terms of REM sleep and sleep architecture.<ref name="pmid2693050" />

===Pharmacokinetics===
The [[Tmax (pharmacology)|time to peak concentrations]] following a dose is 2 to 4&nbsp;hours.<ref name="pmid2693051" /> The typical antidepressant therapeutic range of trimipramine concentrations is 150 to 300&nbsp;ng/mL.<ref name="pmid22681162">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ostad Haji E, Hiemke C, Pfuhlmann B | title = Therapeutic drug monitoring for antidepressant drug treatment | journal = Curr.

Trimipramine is a [[racemic]] compound with two [[enantiomer]]s.{{ref|enantiomer}} [[CYP2C19]] is responsible for the [[demethylation]] of (D)- and (L)-trimipramine to (D)- (L)-desmethyltrimipramine, respectively, and [[CYP2D6]] is responsible for the 2-[[hydroxylation]] of ([[dextrorotation|D]])- and ([[levorotation|L]])-desmethyltrimipramine to (D)- and (L)-2-hydroxydesmethyltrimipramine, respectively.<ref name="pmid10774635">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Eap CB, Bender S, Gastpar M, etal |title=Steady state plasma levels of the enantiomers of trimipramine and of its metabolites in CYP2D6-, CYP2C19- and CYP3A4/5-phenotyped patients |journal=Ther Drug Monit |volume=22|issue=2|pages=209–14 |year=2000 |pmid=10774635 |doi= 10.1097/00007691-200004000-00012|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0163-4356&volume=22&issue=2&spage=209}}</ref> CYP2D6 also metabolizes (L)-trimipramine into (L)-2-hydroxytrimipramine.<ref name="pmid10774635"/>
