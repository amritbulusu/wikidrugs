'''Velaglucerase alfa''' (trade name '''VPRIV'''), manufactured by [[Shire plc]] is a hydrolytic [[lysosomal]] [[glucocerebroside]]-specific enzyme, which is a recombinant form of [[glucocerebrosidase]] indicated as a long-term enzyme replacement therapy for those suffering of [[Gaucher disease]] Type 1. It has an identical amino acid sequence to the naturally occurring enzyme.<ref>University of Birmingham: [http://www.haps.bham.ac.uk/publichealth/horizon/outputs/documents/2009/may-aug/Velaglucerase.pdf Velaglucerase alfa for type 1 Gaucher’s disease]</ref> It was approved for use by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) on February 26, 2010.<ref>Medical News Today: [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/180630.php Shire Announces FDA Approval Of VPRIV(TM) (velaglucerase Alfa For Injection) For The Treatment Of Type 1 Gaucher Disease], 27 February 2010</ref>

==Competitive products==
[[Imiglucerase]] is [[Genzyme]]'s version of recombinant glucocerebrosidase. It is marketed globally under the trade name of Cerezyme.

In addition, [[Protalix]] and [[Pfizer]] have received approval for marketing [[taliglucerase alpha]] in Israel, Brazil, Canada and the U.S. The companies are expected also to file for marketing authorization in Europe and elsewhere around the world.
