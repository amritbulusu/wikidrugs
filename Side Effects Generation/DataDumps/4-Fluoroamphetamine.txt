'''4-Fluoroamphetamine''' ('''4-FA'''; '''4-FMP'''; '''PAL-303'''; "'''Flux'''"), also known as '''''para''-fluoroamphetamine''' ('''PFA''') is a [[psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] [[research chemical]] of the [[phenethylamine]] and [[substituted amphetamine]] [[chemical class]]es. It produces [[stimulant]] and [[entactogen]]ic effects, and is described subjectively as being between amphetamine and MDMA. As a [[recreational drug]], 4-FA is sometimes sold along with related compounds such as [[2-fluoroamphetamine]] and [[4-fluoromethamphetamine]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rösner | first1 = P | last2 = Quednow | first2 = B | last3 = Girreser | first3 = U | last4 = Junge | first4 = T | title = Isomeric fluoro-methoxy-phenylalkylamines: a new series of controlled-substance analogues (designer drugs) | journal = Forensic Science International | volume = 148 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 143–56 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15639609 | doi = 10.1016/j.forsciint.2004.05.003 }}</ref><ref name="Nagai 2007">{{cite journal | last1 = Nagai | first1 = F | last2 = Nonaka | first2 = R | last3 = Satoh Hisashi Kamimura | first3 = K | title = The effects of non-medically used psychoactive drugs on monoamine neurotransmission in rat brain | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 559 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 132–7 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17223101 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2006.11.075 }}</ref>

==Usage==

4-FA is popular in the Netherlands where it is predominantly used for its specific effects (77% of users) rather than its legal status (18%).<ref name="LinsenKoning2015"/>

===Effects===

The subjective effects of 4-fluoroamphetamine include [[euphoria]] which some find similar to the effects of [[MDMA]] and amphetamine,<ref name="LinsenKoning2015">{{cite journal|last1=Linsen|first1=Felix|last2=Koning|first2=Raoul P.

The general course of effects involves primarily empathogenic effects for the first few hours, which fades out as increased stimulation develops over the next several hours. {{medcn|date=August 2014}}

The [[Dopamine reuptake inhibitor|dopamine reuptake inhibition]] produced by 4-FA is stronger than that of either [[para-Chloroamphetamine|4-CA]] or [[para-Iodoamphetamine|4-IA]].<ref name=fluoro>{{Cite journal

Common acute side effects are nausea, headaches, increased heart rate and insomnia.{{medcn|date=January 2013}}

==Pharmacology==
4-Fluoroamphetamine is a [[releasing agent]] and [[reuptake inhibitor]] of [[dopamine]], [[serotonin]], and [[norepinephrine]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The respective [[EC50|EC<sub>50</sub>]] values are 2.0 x 10<sup>−7</sup> M, 7.3 x 10<sup>−7</sup> M, and 0.37 x 10<sup>−7</sup> M, while the [[IC50|IC<sub>50</sub>]] values are 7.7 x 10<sup>−7</sup> M, 68 x 10<sup>−7</sup> M, and 4.2 x 10<sup>−7</sup> M.<ref name="Nagai 2007" />

Regarding the metabolic fate of 4-FA, the C-F bond at the 4-position on the phenyl ring likely resists deactivation in the liver by [[cytochrome P450 oxidase]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fisher MB, Henne KR, Boer J |title=The complexities inherent in attempts to decrease drug clearance by blocking sites of CYP-mediated metabolism |journal=Current Opinion in Drug Discovery & Development |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=101–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16445122}}</ref>

===Neurotoxicity===
4-FA does not cause long-lasting depletion of brain serotonin, unlike its [[structural analog|analogs]] [[para-Chloroamphetamine|4-CA]] and [[para-Bromoamphetamine|4-BA]].<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1978.tb31530.x| pmid = 81648| title = Neurotoxic Action of Halogenated Amphetamines| journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences| volume = 305| pages = 289–304| year = 1978| last1 = Harvey | first1 = J.

Neurotoxicity does not increase down the series of ''para''-halogenated amphetamine derivatives, even though serotonin releasing potency does follow this trend. For example, 4-iodoamphetamine is less toxic than is 4-chloroamphetamine.<ref name=fluoro/><ref>{{Cite journal
