'''Donnatal''' is a proprietary combination medication for the treatment of intestinal cramping due to various causes, often administered as part of a [[GI cocktail]].<ref name="Berman">{{cite journal  | vauthors = Berman DA, Porter RS, Graber M | title = The GI Cocktail is no more effective than plain liquid antacid: a randomized3 | pages = 239–244 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14585449 | doi = 10.1016/S0736-4679(03)00196-3 | volume=25 | journal=J Emerg Med}}</ref>  It is classed as an [[anticholinergic]] antispasmodic drug.  Donnatal is marketed by PBM Pharmaceuticals. It is available as tablets, capsules, extended release tablets and elixir. Active ingredients are listed as: [[phenobarbital]], [[atropine]] and [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]]. The latter two ingredients are found in plants of the [[Solanaceae]] family.

Recent clinical trials showed that Donnatal was no more effective than plain [[antacid]] in relieving the symptoms of [[dyspepsia]].<ref name=Berman/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bowman J, Jones J | title = Use of lidocaine in the gastrointestinal cocktail for the treatment of dyspepsia | journal = Emergency Medicine Journal | volume = 23 | issue = 11 | pages = 873–874 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17057145 | url = http://emj.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17057145 | doi = 10.1136/emj.2006.042168 | pmc = 2464394 }}</ref> However, the active ingredients in Donnatal® have been shown to be more effective than placebo in treating moderately severe symptoms of [[irritable bowel syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rhodes JB, Abrams JH, Manning RT | title = Controlled clinical trial of sedative-anticholinergic drugs in patients with the irritable bowel syndrome | journal = Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 18 | issue = 7 | pages = 340–345 | year = 1978 | pmid = 353089 | doi=10.1002/j.1552-4604.1978.tb01603.x}}</ref>

It is also a common component of a GI cocktail used in emergency rooms. In 1976, Donnatal was one of the 25 most widely prescribed drugs in the U.S.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Knapp DE, Crosby DL, Brandon BM, Knapp DA |title=Can pharmacists influence drug prescribing?
