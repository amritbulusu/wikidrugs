'''Aleph''' (or '''alef''' or '''alif''') is the first [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] of the [[Semitic abjads]], including [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] 'Ālep 𐤀, [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] 'Ālef <big>{{lang|he|א}}</big>, [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] Ālap 𐡀, [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]] ʾĀlap̄ <big>{{lang|syr|ܐ}}</big>, [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] {{transl|ar|ALA|Alif}} <big>{{lang|ar|ا}}</big>, and [[Persian alphabet|Persian]]. It also appears as [[Ancient South Arabian script|South Arabian]] 𐩱, and [[Ge'ez script|Ge'ez]] ʾÄlef አ.

The Phoenician letter is derived from an [[Egyptian hieroglyph]] depicting an ox's head<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/521235.stm|title=BBC News - Middle East - Oldest alphabet found in Egypt|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref> and gave rise to the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Alpha (letter)|Alpha]] (Α), being re-interpreted to express not the [[glottal consonant]] but the accompanying [[vowel]], and hence the [[Latin]] [[A]] and [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] [[A (Cyrillic)|А]].

In [[phonetics]], aleph {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑː|l|ɛ|f}} originally represented the onset of a vowel at the [[glottis]]. In Semitic languages, this functions as a weak consonant allowing roots with only two true consonants to be conjugated in the manner of a standard three consonant Semitic root. In most Hebrew dialects as well as Syriac, the glottal onset represented by Aleph is an absence of a true consonant although a [[glottal stop]] ({{IPAblink|ʔ}}), which is a true consonant, typically occurs as an allophone. In Arabic, the Alif has the glottal stop pronunciation when occurring initially. In text with diacritical marks, the pronunciation as a glottal stop is usually indicated by a special marking, [[hamza]] in Arabic and [[mappiq]] in Tiberian Hebrew. (Although once thought to be the original pronunciation of Aleph in all cases where it behaves as a consonant, a consistent glottal stop appears to have been absent in ancient Semitic languages such as Akkadian and Ugaritic besides being absent in Syriac and Hebrew.) Occasionally, the Aleph was also used to indicate an initial unstressed vowel before certain consonant clusters, without functioning as a consonant itself, the ''[[Prothesis (linguistics)|prosthetic (or prothetic)]] aleph''. In later Semitic languages, Aleph could sometimes function as a ''[[mater lectionis]]'' indicating the presence of a vowel elsewhere (usually long). The period at which use as a mater lectionis began is the subject of some controversy, though it had become well established by the late stage of Old Aramaic (ca. 200 BCE). Aleph is often [[transliteration|transliterated]] as {{unichar|02BE}}, based on the Greek ''[[spiritus lenis]]'' {{lang|grc|ʼ}}, for example, in the transliteration of the letter name itself, ''{{transl|sem|ʾāleph}}''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Andersen|first1=F.I.|last2=Freedman|first2=D.N.|title=Studies in Hebrew and Aramaic Orthography|date=1992|publisher=Eisenbrauns|location=Winona Lake, Indiana|pages=79–90|chapter=Aleph as a vowel in Old Aramaic}}</ref>

==Origin==
The name ''aleph'' is derived from the West Semitic word for "[[ox]]", and the shape of the letter derives from a [[Proto-Sinaitic]] glyph that may have been based on an [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Egyptian hieroglyph]] <hiero> F1 </hiero>, which depicts an ox's head.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.dictionary.com/a/|title=What did the letter A originally sound and look like? - Dictionary.com Blog|work=Dictionary Blog}}</ref>

In [[Modern Standard Arabic]], the word {{lang|ar|أليف}} {{IPA|/ʔaliːf/}} literally means 'tamed' or 'familiar', derived from the root {{IPA|{{!}}ʔ-l-f{{!}}}}, from which the verb ألِف {{IPA|/ʔalifa/}} means 'to be acquainted with; to be on intimate terms with'.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wehr|first=Hans|title=A Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic: (Arabic-English)|year=1994|publisher=Spoken Language Services|location=Urbana|isbn=0879500034|pages=28–29|edition=4th|authorlink=Hans Wehr}}</ref> In modern Hebrew, the same root {{IPA|{{!}}ʔ-l-f{{!}}}} (alef-lamed-peh) gives ''me’ulaf'', the passive participle of the verb ''le’alef'', meaning 'trained' (when referring to pets) or 'tamed' (when referring to wild animals); the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] rank of [[Aluf]], taken from an [[Edom]]ite title of nobility, is also cognate.{{clarify|date=October 2011}}

==Arabic==
Written as {{lang|ar|ا}}, spelled as {{lang|ar|ألف}} and transliterated as ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}'', it is the first letter in [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]]. Together with Hebrew Aleph, Greek [[Alpha (letter)|Alpha]] and Latin [[A]], it is descended from [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] {{transl|sem|ʾāleph}}, from a reconstructed Proto-Canaanite ''{{transl|sem|ʾalp}}'' "ox".

Alif is written in one of the following ways depending on its position in the word:
{{Arabic alphabet shapes|ا}}

===Arabic variants===
{{anchor|hamzat qaṭ‘|hamzat qaṭ`|hamzat qaṭ}}
The Arabic letter was used to render either a long {{IPA|/aː/}} or a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|/ʔ/}}. That led to [[orthographical]] confusion and to the introduction of the additional letter ''{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzat qaṭ‘}}'' <big>{{lang|ar|ﺀ}}</big>. [[Hamzah|Hamza]] is not considered a full letter in Arabic orthography: in most cases, it appears on a carrier, either a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|wāw}}'' (<big>{{lang|ar|ؤ}} </big>), a dotless ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yā’}}'' (<big>{{lang|ar|ئ}}</big>), or an alif. The choice of carrier depends on complicated orthographic rules. Alif <big>{{lang|ar|إ أ}}</big> is generally the carrier if the only adjacent vowel is ''{{transl|ar|ALA|fatḥah}}''. It is the only possible carrier if hamza is the first phoneme of a word. Where alif acts as a carrier for hamza, hamza is added above the alif, or, for initial alif-''{{transl|ar|ALA|kasrah}}'', below it and indicates that the letter so modified is indeed a glottal stop, not a long vowel.

{{anchor|hamzat waṣl|hamzat wasl}}
A second type of hamza, 
{{Arabic alphabet shapes|ؤ}}''{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzat waṣl}}'' ({{lang|ar|همزة وصل}}), occurs only as the initial phoneme of the [[Al-|definite article]] and in some related cases. It differs from ''{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzat qaṭ‘}}'' in that it is elided after a preceding vowel. Again, alif is always the carrier.

{{anchor|alif maddah|alif madda}}
The ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif [[maddah]]}}'' is a double alif, expressing both a glottal stop and a long vowel. Essentially, it is the same as a {{lang|ar|أا}} sequence: {{lang|ar|آ}} (final {{lang|ar|ـآ}}) {{Arabic alphabet shapes|آ}}{{transl|ar|ALA|’ā}} {{IPA|/ʔaː/}}, for example in {{lang|ar|آخر}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ākhir}}'' {{IPA|/ʔaːxir/}} 'last'. "It has become standard for a ''hamza'' followed by a long ā to be written as two ''alifs'', one vertical and one horizontal"<ref>

{{Arabic alphabet shapes|ى}}
{{Anchor|alifmaqsura}}The ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif maqṣūrah}}'' ({{lang|ar|ألف مقصورة}}, 'limited/restricted alif'), commonly known in Egypt as ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif layyinah}}'' ({{lang|ar|ألف لينة}}, 'flexible alif'), looks like a dotless [[ya'|{{transl|ar|ALA|yā’}}]] <big>{{lang|ar|ى}}</big> (final <big>{{lang|ar|ـى}}</big>) and may appear only at the end of a word. Although it looks different from a regular ''alif'', it represents the same sound {{IPA|/aː/}}, often realized as a short vowel. When it is written, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif maqṣūrah}}'' is indistinguishable from final [[Persian alphabet|Persian]] ''[[Yodh#Perso-Arabic ye|ye]]'' or Arabic ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yā’}}'' as it is written in Egypt, Sudan and sometimes elsewhere. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Alif maqsurah}}'' is transliterated as {{transl|ar|ALA|á}} in [[ALA-LC Romanization|ALA-LC]], {{transl|ar|DIN|ā}} in [[DIN 31635]], {{transl|ar|ISO 233-2|à}} in ISO 233-2, and {{transl|ar|ISO 233|ỳ}} in [[ISO 233]].

===Numeral===
As a numeral, Alaph/Olaf stands for the number one. With a dot below, it is the number 1,000; with a line above it, Alaph/Olaf will represent 1,000,000. With a line below it is 10,000 and with two dots below it is 10,000,000.

==Aramaic==

The Aramaic reflex of the letter is conventionally represented with the Hebrew {{lang|he|א}} in typography for convenience, but the actual graphic form varied significantly over the long history and wide geographic extent of the language. Maraqten identifies three different aleph traditions in East Arabian coins, a lapidary Aramaic form that realizes it as a combination of a V-shape and a straight stroke attached to the apex, much like a Latin K; a [[cursive]] Aramaic form he calls the "elaborated X-form", essentially the same tradition as the Hebrew [[Linguistic reconstruction|reflex]]; and an extremely cursive form with of two crossed oblique lines, much like a simple Latin X.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Maraqten|first1=Mohammed|title=Notes on the Aramaic script of some coins from East Arabia|journal=[[Arabian Archaeology and Epigraphy]]|date=1996|volume=7|pages=304–315|url=http://www.academia.edu/1556846/Notes_on_the_Aramaic_script_of_some_coins_from_East_Arabia}}</ref>

==Hebrew==

It is written as <big>{{lang|he|א}}</big> and spelled as <big>{{lang|he|אָלֶף}}</big>

In [[Modern Hebrew|Modern Israeli Hebrew]], the letter either represents a [[glottal stop]] ({{IPAblink|ʔ}}) or indicates a [[Hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]] (the separation of two adjacent [[vowels]] into distinct [[syllable]]s, with no intervening [[consonant]]). It is sometimes silent (word-finally always, word-medially sometimes: {{Hebrew|הוּא}} {{IPA|[hu]}} "he", {{Hebrew|רָאשִׁי}} {{IPA|[ʁaˈʃi]}} "main", {{Hebrew|רֹאשׁ}} {{IPA|[ʁoʃ]}} "head", {{Hebrew|רִאשׁוֹן}} {{IPA|[ʁiˈʃon]}} "first"). The pronunciation varies in different [[Jewish ethnic divisions]].

In [[gematria]], aleph represents the number 1, and when used at the beginning of [[Hebrew calendar|Hebrew years]], it means 1000 (e.g. {{Hebrew|א'תשנ"ד}} in [[Arabic numerals|numbers]] would be the [[Calendar date|date]] 1754).

Aleph, along with [[Ayin]], [[Resh]], and [[Heth (letter)|Heth]], cannot receive a [[dagesh]]. (However, there are few very rare examples of the [[Masoretes]] adding a dagesh or [[mappiq]] to an Aleph or Resh. The verses of [[the Hebrew Bible]] for which an Aleph with a mappiq or dagesh appears are [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 43:26, [[Leviticus]] 23:17, [[Book of Job|Job]] 33:21 and [[Ezra]] 8:18.)

In Modern Hebrew, the frequency of the usage of alef, out of all the letters, is 4.94%.

Aleph is sometimes used as a [[mater lectionis]] to denote a vowel, usually {{IPA|/a/}}. That use is more common in words of [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] origin, in foreign names, and some other borrowed words.

===Rabbinic Judaism===
Aleph is the subject of a [[midrash]] that praises its humility in not demanding to start the Bible. (In [[Hebrew]], the Bible begins with the second letter of the [[alphabet]], [[Bet (letter)|Bet]].) In this folktale, Aleph is rewarded by being allowed to start the [[Ten Commandments]]. (In [[Hebrew]], the first word is {{Hebrew|אָנֹכִי}}, which starts with an aleph.)

In the [[Sefer Yetzirah]], the [[letter (alphabet)|letter]] aleph is [[king]] over breath, formed air in the universe, temperate in the year, and the [[chest]] in the soul.

Aleph is also the first letter of the [[Hebrew]] word ''emet'' ({{Hebrew|אֶמֶת}}), which means ''truth''. In [[Jewish mythology]], it was the letter aleph that was carved into the head of the [[golem]] that ultimately gave it life.

Aleph also begins the three words that make up God's mystical name in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[I Am that I Am|I Am who I Am]] (in [[Hebrew]], Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh {{lang|he|אהיה אשר אהיה}}), and aleph is an important part of mystical [[amulet]]s and formulas.

Aleph, in [[Jewish mysticism]], represents the oneness of God. The letter can be seen as being composed of an upper yud ([[Yodh]]), a lower yud, and a vav ([[Waw (letter)]]) leaning on a diagonal. The upper yud represents the hidden and ineffable aspects of God while the lower yud represents God's revelation and presence in the world. The vav ("hook") connects the two realms.

Jewish mysticism relates aleph to the element of air, the Fool (Key 0, value 1) of the major arcana of the tarot deck,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tarotjourney.net/tarot-cards/major-arcana/1-the-magician/|title=Tarot Journey with Leisa ReFalo|work=tarotjourney.net}}</ref> and the Scintillating Intelligence (#11) of the path between Kether and Chokmah in the Tree of the Sephiroth.

[[File:Syriac letter shapes Alaph.PNG|500px]]

In the [[Syriac alphabet]], the first letter is {{lang|syr|ܐ}}, {{lang-syc|ܐܵܠܲܦ}}, Alap (in eastern dialects) or Olaph (in western dialects). It is used in word-initial position to mark a word beginning with a vowel, but some words beginning with ''i'' or ''u'' do not need its help, and sometimes, an initial Alap/Olaph is [[elision|elided]]. For example, when the Syriac [[grammatical person|first-person]] [[grammatical number|singular]] [[pronoun]] {{lang|syc|ܐܵܢܵܐ}} is in [[clitic|enclitic]] positions, it is pronounced ''no/na'' (again west/east), rather than the full form ''eno/ana''. The letter occurs very regularly at the end of words, where it represents the long final vowels ''o/a'' or ''e''. In the middle of the word, the letter represents either a [[glottal stop]] between vowels (but West Syriac pronunciation often makes it a [[palatal approximant]]), a long ''i/e'' (less commonly ''o/a'') or is silent.

== South Arabian/Ge'ez ==
In the [[Ancient South Arabian script|Ancient South Arabian alphabet]], 𐩱 appears as the seventeenth letter of the South Arabian abjad. The letter is used to render a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|/ʔ/}}.

In the [[Ge'ez script|Ge'ez alphabet]], ʾÄlef አ appears as the thirteenth letter of its abjad. This letter is also used to render a glottal stop {{IPA|/ʔ/}}.

==Ancient Egyptian==

{{Hiero|"Aleph" |<hiero> A </hiero>|align=right|era=egypt}}

The Egyptian "[[Egyptian vulture#In culture|vulture]]" [[hieroglyph]] ([[Gardiner's sign list|Gardiner]] [[Vulture (hieroglyph)|G1]]), by convention pronounced {{IPA|[a]}}) is also referred to as ''aleph'', on grounds that it has traditionally been taken to represent a [[glottal stop]], although some recent suggestions<ref>Schneider, Thomas. 2003. "Etymologische Methode, die Historizität der Phoneme und das ägyptologische Transkriptionsalphabet." Lingua aegyptia: Journal of Egyptian Language Studies 11:187–199.</ref> tend towards an {{IPAblink|ɹ}} sound instead. Despite the name it does not correspond to an Aleph in cognate Semitic words, where instead the single "reed" hieroglyph is found instead.

The [[phoneme]] is commonly [[transliterated]] by a symbol composed of two half-rings, in [[Unicode]] (as of version 5.1, in the [[Latin Extended-D]] range) encoded at U+A722 Ꜣ <small>LATIN CAPITAL LETTER EGYPTOLOGICAL ALEF</small> and U+A723 ꜣ <small>LATIN SMALL LETTER EGYPTOLOGICAL ALEF</small>. A fallback representation is the numeral ''3'', or the Middle English character ''ȝ'' [[Yogh#In Egyptology|Yogh]]; neither are to be preferred to the genuine Egyptological characters.

==Other uses==
===Mathematics===
In [[set theory]], the Hebrew aleph glyph is used as the symbol to denote the [[aleph number]]s, which represent the [[cardinality]] of infinite sets. This notation was introduced by mathematician [[Georg Cantor]]. In older mathematics books, the letter aleph is often printed upside down by accident, partly because a [[Monotype Imaging|Monotype]] matrix for aleph was mistakenly constructed the wrong way up.<ref>{{citation|mr=0553111
