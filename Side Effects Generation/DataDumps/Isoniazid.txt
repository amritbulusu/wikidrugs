==Medical uses==
Isoniazid is approved for latent and active tuberculous infections. For the latter, it must be used in combination with other tuberculosis medications to prevent the development of drug resistance.

Isoniazid has been approved as prophylactic therapy for the following populations:
* People with HIV infection and a PPD (purified protein derivative) reaction of at least 5&nbsp;mm induration
* Contacts of people with tuberculosis and who have a PPD reaction at least 5&nbsp;mm induration
* People whose PPD reactions convert from negative to positive in a two-year period &ndash; at least 10&nbsp;mm induration for those up to 35 years of age, and at least 15&nbsp;mm induration for those at least 35 years old
* People with pulmonary damage on their chest X-ray that is likely to be due to healed tuberculosis and also have a PPD reaction at least 5&nbsp;mm induration
* Injection drug users whose HIV status is negative who have a PPD reaction at least 10&nbsp;mm induration
* People with a PPD of greater than or equal to 10&nbsp;mm induration who are foreign-born from high prevalence geographical regions, low-income populations, and patients residing in long-term facilities<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{cite journal|title=The Use of Preventive Therapy for Tuberculosis Infection in the United States - Recommendations of the Advisory Committee for Elimination of Tuberculosis|journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|date=May 18, 1990|volume=39 (RR-8)|pages=9–12|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001643.htm|accessdate=22 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302075630/http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001643.htm|archivedate=2 March 2016|df=}}</ref>

===Special populations===
It is recommended that women with active tuberculosis who are pregnant or breastfeeding take isoniazid. Preventive therapy should be delayed until after giving birth.<ref name="dailymed.nlm.nih.gov">https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=5ab01773-d1e4-4b87-884a-9e5b3f13bdcb</ref> Nursing mothers excrete a relatively low and non-toxic concentration of INH in breast milk, and their babies are at low risk for side effects.

Isoniazid is associated with pyridoxine deficiency due to the increased excretion of pyridoxine. Pyridoxal phosphate (a derivative of pyridoxine) is required for d-aminolevulinic acid synthase, the enzyme responsible for the rate-limiting step in heme synthesis. Therefore, isoniazid-induced pyridoxine deficiency causes insufficient heme formation in early red blood cells, leading to [[sideroblastic anemia]].<ref name=":2" />

==Drug interactions==
People taking isoniazid and acetaminophen are at risk of acetaminophen toxicity. Isoniazid is thought to induce a liver enzyme which causes a larger amount of acetaminophen to be metabolized to a toxic form.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=R.|last2=Swartz|first2=R.|last3=Watkins|first3=P.B.|title=Severe acetaminophen toxicity in a patient receiving isoniazid|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|date=November 15, 1990|volume=113|issue=10|pages=799–800|pmid=2240884|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-113-10-799}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Burk|first1=R.F.|last2=Hill|first2=K.E.|last3=Hunt Jr.|first3=R.W.|last4=Martin|first4=A.E.|title=Isoniazid potentiation of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in the rat and 4-methylpyrazole inhibition of it|journal=Research Communications in Chemical Pathology and Pharmacolog|date=July 1990|volume=69|issue=1|pages=115–118|pmid=2218067}}</ref>

Isoniazid decreases the metabolism of carbamazepine, thus slowing down its clearance from the body. People taking carbamazepine should have their carbamazepine levels monitored and, if necessary, have their dose adjusted accordingly.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fleenor|first1=M.E.|last2=Harden|first2=J.W.|last3=Curtis|first3=G.|title=Interaction between carbamazepine and antituberculosis agents|journal=Chest|date=June 1991|volume=99|issue=6|page=1554|pmid=2036861|doi=10.1378/chest.99.6.1554a}}</ref>

Valproate levels may increase when taken with isoniazid. Valproate levels should be monitored and its dose adjusted if necessary.<ref name="Jonville"/>

==Mechanism of action==
Isoniazid is a [[prodrug]] and must be activated by a bacterial catalase-peroxidase enzyme in ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' called KatG.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Suarez|first1=J.|last2=Ranguelova|first2=K.|last3=Jarzecki|first3=A.A.|display-authors=et al.|title=An oxyferrous heme/protein-based radical intermediate is catalytically competent in the catalase reaction of Mycobacterium tuberculosis catalase-peroxidase (KatG)|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=284|issue=11|pages=7017–7029|date=March 2009|pmid=19139099|doi=10.1074/jbc.M808106200|pmc=2652337}}</ref> KatG catalyzes the formation of the isonicotinic acyl radical, which spontaneously couples with [[NADH]] to form the nicotinoyl-NAD adduct. This complex binds tightly to the [[enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase]] known as InhA, thereby blocking the natural enoyl-AcpM substrate and the action of [[fatty acid synthase]]. This process inhibits the synthesis of [[mycolic acids]], which are required components of the [[mycobacterium|mycobacterial]] cell wall. A range of radicals are produced by KatG activation of isoniazid, including [[nitric oxide]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Timmins|first1=G.S.|last2=Master|first2=S|last3=Rusnak|first3=F.|last4=Deretic|first4=V.|title=Nitric oxide generated from isoniazid activation by KatG: source of nitric oxide and activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis|journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy|volume=48|issue=8|pages=3006–3009|date=August 2004|pmid=15273113|pmc=478481|doi=10.1128/AAC.48.8.3006-3009.2004}}</ref> which has also been shown to be important in the action of another antimycobacterial prodrug [[pretomanid]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Singh|first1=R.|last2=Manjunatha|first2=U.|last3=Boshoff|first3=H.I.|display-authors=et al.|title=PA-824 kills nonreplicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis by intracellular NO release|journal=Science|volume=322|issue=5906|pages=1392–1395|date=November 2008|pmid=19039139|doi=10.1126/science.1164571|pmc=2723733|bibcode=2008Sci...322.1392S }}</ref>

==Metabolism==
Isoniazid reaches therapeutic concentrations in serum, [[cerebrospinal fluid]], and within [[caseous necrosis|caseous granulomas]]. It is metabolized in the liver via [[acetylation]] into acetylhydrazine. Two forms of the enzyme are responsible for acetylation, so some patients metabolize the drug more quickly than others. Hence, the [[half-life]] is [[Bimodal distribution|bimodal]], with "slow acetylators" and "fast acetylators". A graph of number of people versus time shows peaks at one and three hours. The height of the peaks depends on the ethnicities of the people being tested. The metabolites are excreted in the urine. Doses do not usually have to be adjusted in case of [[renal failure]].

==History==
Three pharmaceutical companies unsuccessfully attempted to patent the drug at the same time,<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=Lancet|volume=373|issue=9670|pages=1148–1149|year=2009|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60559-6|title=Fourth-generation fluoroquinolones in tuberculosis|author=Hans L. Riede|pmid=19345815}}</ref> the most prominent one being Roche, which launched its version, Rimifon, in 1952.<ref>[http://www.rocheusa.com/about/history.html Roche USA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212082842/http://www.rocheusa.com/about/history.html |date=2007-12-12 }}</ref> With the introduction of isoniazid, a cure for tuberculosis was first considered possible.

The drug was first tested at [[Many Farms, Arizona|Many Farms]], a [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] community, due to the Navajo reservation's tuberculosis problem and because the population had not previously been treated with [[streptomycin]], the main tuberculosis treatment at the time.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=David S.|title=The Health Care Experiments at Many Farms: The Navajo, Tuberculosis, and the Limits of Modern Medicine, 1952-1962|journal=Bulletin of the History of Medicine|year=2002|volume=76|issue=4|pages=749–790|doi=10.1353/bhm.2002.0186|pmid=12446978}}</ref>

Isoniazid, along with iproniazid - a related drug - were among the first drugs to be referred to as antidepressants.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moncrieff|first=Joanna|date=June 2008|title=The creation of the concept of an antidepressant: an historical analysis|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18321627|journal=Social Science & Medicine (1982)|volume=66|issue=11|pages=2346–2355|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.01.047|issn=0277-9536|pmid=18321627|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160802202635/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18321627|archivedate=2016-08-02|df=}}</ref>

==Preparation==
Isoniazid is manufactured using [[4-cyanopyridine]] and [[hydrazine hydrate]].<ref name=William>{{cite book|last1=William Andrew Publishing|title=Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Encyclopedia|date=2008|publisher=Elsevier Science|location=Norwich, NY|isbn=9780815515265|pages=1968–1970|edition=3rd|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bRX8MwEACAAJ&dq=9780815515265}}</ref> The former [[reagent]] is produced via the [[ammoxidation]] of [[4-Methylpyridine|4-methylpyridine]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shimizu|first1=Shinkichi|last2=Watanabe|first2=Nanao|last3=Kataoka|first3=Toshiaki|last4=Shoji|first4=Takayuki|last5=Abe|first5=Nobuyuki|last6=Morishita|first6=Sinji|last7=Ichimura|first7=Hisao|title=Pyridine and Pyridine Derivatives|journal=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|publisher= Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In another method, isoniazid was claimed to have been made from [[citric acid]] starting material.<ref name="BaizerDub1956">{{cite journal|last1=Baizer|first1=Manuel M.|last2=Dub|first2=Michael|last3=Gister|first3=Sidney|last4=Steinberg|first4=Nathan G.|title=Synthesis of Isoniazid from Citric Acid|journal=Journal of the American Pharmaceutical Association (Scientific ed.)|volume=45|issue=7|year=1956|pages=478–480|issn=0095-9553|doi=10.1002/jps.3030450714}}</ref>

==Other uses==

===Chromatography===
Isonicotinic acid hydrazide is also used in [[chromatography]] to differentiate between various degrees of [[conjugated system|conjugation]] in [[organic compound]]s barring the [[ketone]] [[functional group]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=L.L.|last2=Foell|first2=Theodore|title=Differentiation of Δ4-3-Ketosteroids and Δ1,4-3-Ketosteroids with Isonicotinic Acid Hydrazide|journal=Analytical Chemistry|date=1959|volume=31|issue=1|pages=102–105|doi=10.1021/ac60145a020}}</ref> The test works by forming a [[hydrazone]] which can be detected by its [[bathochromic shift]].
