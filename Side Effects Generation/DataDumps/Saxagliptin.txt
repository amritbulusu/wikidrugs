===Pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer===
An association of the DPP-IV inhibitor class with pancreatic problems has been proposed, mainly based on case reports associated with the DPP-IV inhibitor sitagliptin and several incretin mimetics including [[exenatide]].

In a joint letter to the New England Journal of Medicines, the agencies stated that "Both agencies agree that assertions concerning a causal association between incretin-based drugs and pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer, as expressed recently in the scientific literature and in the media, are inconsistent with the current data. The FDA and the EMA have not reached a final conclusion at this time regarding such a causal relationship.

==Production==
The synthesis of saxagliptin by Bristol-Myers Squibb by the amide coupling of N-Boc-3-hydroxyadamantylglycine ('''2''') and methanoprolineamide ('''3''') with [[1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide|EDC]]. The former is commercially available, whereas the latter is available as the N-Boc analog. The prolineamide moiety is subsequently dehydrated with [[trifluoroacetic anhydride]] to give the cyanide as the trifluoracetate ester, which is hydrolyzed. Removal of the [[Boc anhydride|Boc protecting group]], followed by neutralization gives the desired product ('''1'''):<ref>{{cite journal | journal = [[Org. Process Res.

==Pharmacology==
Saxagliptin is part of a class of diabetes medications called [[dipeptidyl peptidase-4]] (DPP-4) inhibitors.
DPP-4 is an enzyme that breaks down [[incretin]] hormones. As a [[Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor|DPP-4 inhibitor]], saxagliptin slows down the breakdown of incretin hormones, increasing the level of these hormones in the body. It is this increase in incretin hormones that is responsible for the beneficial actions of saxagliptin, including increasing insulin production in response to meals and decreasing the rate of [[gluconeogenesis]] in the liver.<ref>[http://diabetes.emedtv.com/onglyza/onglyza.html] Diabetes info</ref>

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4's role in [[blood glucose]] regulation is thought to be through degradation of [[glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide|GIP]]<ref name="mentlein">{{cite journal

Because incretin hormones are more active in response to higher blood sugar levels (and are less active in response to low blood sugar), the risk of dangerously low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) is low with saxagliptin monotherapy.
