'''Aflibercept''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]) is a [[biopharmaceutical]] [[pharmaceutical drug|drug]] invented by [[Regeneron|Regeneron Pharmaceuticals]], approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of [[wet macular degeneration]] under the trade name '''Eylea''', and for metastatic [[colorectal cancer]] as '''Zaltrap'''.  As the active ingredient of Zaltrap, the substance is called '''ziv-aflibercept''' in the US.

It is an inhibitor of [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF).<ref name="pmid18499749">{{cite journal |vauthors =Fraser HM, Wilson H, Silvestri A, Morris KD, Wiegand SJ |title=The Role of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor and Estradiol in the Regulation of Endometrial Angiogenesis and Cell Proliferation in the Marmoset |journal=Endocrinology |volume= 149|issue= 9|pages= 4413–20|date=May 2008 |pmid=18499749 |doi=10.1210/en.2008-0325 |url=http://endo.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18499749}}</ref><ref name="pmid18388198">{{cite journal |vauthors =Duncan WC, van den Driesche S, Fraser HM |title=Inhibition of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor in the Primate Ovary Up-Regulates Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1{alpha} in the Follicle and Corpus Luteum |journal=Endocrinology |volume=149 |issue=7 |pages=3313–20 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18388198 |doi=10.1210/en.2007-1649 |url=http://endo.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18388198}}</ref>

Aflibercept is being co-developed for cancer treatment by [[Sanofi]] and Regeneron under a deal signed in 2003, and is being co-developed for eye diseases by [[Bayer HealthCare]] and Regeneron under a deal signed in 2006.<ref>The Vault. [http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/pharmaceuticals-and-biotechnology/regeneron-pharmaceuticals-inc/company-overview.aspx Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.]  Page accessed April 14, 2014</ref>

==Composition==
Aflibercept is a [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] [[fusion protein]] consisting of [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF)-binding portions from the extracellular domains of human VEGF [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s 1 and 2, that are fused to the Fc portion of the human IgG1 [[immunoglobulin]].<ref name=ZaltrapFDA/>

==Indications and administration==
Eylea, the formulation for the treatment of wet macular degeneration, is administered as an [[intravitreal]] injection, that is, into the eye.<ref name="Eylea-Info">{{Drugs.com|pro|eylea}} for Eylea</ref> Zaltrap, for cancer treatment, is given [[intravenous]]ly in combination with the other cancer drugs [[5-fluorouracil]] and [[irinotecan]] and the [[adjuvant]] [[folinic acid]].<ref name="Zaltrap-Info">{{Drugs.com|pro|zaltrap}} for Zaltrap</ref>
In August 27, 2014, Eylea was also indicated for the treatment of patients with visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema, according to the updated summary of product characteristics.<ref>{{cite news|title=New indication for Eylea|url=http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/news-and-analysis/notice-board/new-indication-for-eylea/20066279.article|accessdate=20 September 2014|work=The Pharmaceutical Journal|issue=7826|publisher=Royal Pharmaceutical Society|date=27 Aug 2014}}</ref>

==Contraindications==
Eylea is contraindicated in patients with infections or active [[inflammation]]s of or near the eye,<ref name="Eylea-Info" /> while Zaltrap has no contraindications.<ref name="Zaltrap-Info" />

==Adverse effects==
Common adverse effects of the eye formulation include conjunctival [[hemorrhage]], eye pain, cataract, [[vitreous detachment]], [[floater]]s, and [[ocular hypertension]].<ref name="Eylea-Info" />

Zaltrap has adverse effects typical of anti-cancer drugs, such as reduced blood cell count ([[leukopenia]], [[neutropenia]], [[thrombocytopenia]]), gastrointestinal disorders like diarrhoea and abdominal pain, and fatigue. Another common effect is [[hypertension]] (increased blood pressure).<ref name="Zaltrap-Info" />

==Interactions==
No interactions are described for either formulation.<ref name="Eylea-Info" /><ref name="Zaltrap-Info" />

==Mechanism of action==
In wet macular degeneration, abnormal blood vessels grow in the [[choriocapillaris]], a layer of [[capillaries]] in the eye, leading to blood and protein leakage below the macula.

Tumours need blood vessels sprouting into them when they become larger than a few millimetres, in order to get access to oxygen and nutritive substances to facilitate further growth.

Aflibercept binds to circulating VEGFs and acts like a "VEGF trap".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/778918 |title=Aflibercept Approved for Colorectal Cancer in Europe |date=7 Feb 2013}}</ref> It thereby inhibits the activity of the vascular endothelial growth factor subtypes [[VEGF-A]] and [[VEGF-B]], as well as to [[placental growth factor]] (PGF), inhibiting the growth of new blood vessels in the choriocapillaris or the tumour, respectively.<ref name=Apr2011/> The aim of the cancer treatment, so to speak, is to starve the tumour.

==History==

Regeneron commenced clinical testing of aflibercept in cancer in 2001.<ref name=Timeline>[https://www.regeneron.com/history Regeneron Timeline]</ref>  In 2003, Regeneon signed a major deal with [[Aventis]] to develop aflibercept in the field of cancer.<ref>Candace Hoffmann for First Word Pharma.  September 8th, 2003 [http://www.firstwordpharma.com/node/215613#axzz2yoOgZJHQ Aventis inks deal with Regeneron for collaboration on cancer therapy]</ref>   In 2004 Regeneron started testing the compound, locally delivered, in proliferative eye diseases,<ref name=Timeline/> and in 2006 Regeneron and Bayer signed an agreement to develop the eye indications.<ref>Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News.

===Clinical trials===
In March 2011 Regeneron reported that aflibercept failed its primary [[End point of clinical trials|endpoint]] of overall survival in the Vital [[clinical trial|phase III trial]] for second-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic [[non-small cell lung cancer]] (NSCLC), although it improved the secondary endpoint of progression-free survival.<ref name=Apr2011/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/regeneron-and-sanofi-aventis-cancer-drug-misses-phase-iii-primary-endpoint-but-meets-secondary-targets/81244807/ |title=Regeneron and Sanofi-Aventis Cancer Drug Misses Phase III Primary Endpoint but Meets Secondary Targets |date=11 Mar 2011}}</ref>

In April 2011 Regeneron reported that aflibercept improved its primary endpoint of overall survival in the Velour phase III clinical trial for [[second-line treatment]] for metastatic [[colorectal cancer]] (mCRC).<ref name=Apr2011>{{cite news |url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/regeneron-and-sanofi-aventis-report-positive-phase-iii-mcrc-trial-data/81245067/ |title=Regeneron and Sanofi-Aventis Report Positive Phase III mCRC Trial Data |date=27 Apr 2011 }}</ref>

Aflibercept was also in a phase III trial for [[Hormone-refractory prostate cancer|hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer]] {{as of|2011|4|lc=on}}.<ref name=Apr2011/>

A 2016 [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane Review]] examined outcomes comparing aflibercept versus ranibizumab injections in over 2400 patients with neovascular AMD, from two randomized controlled trials. Both treatment options yielded similar improvements in visual acuity and morphological outcomes in patients, though the authors note that the aflibercept treatment regimen has the potential to reduce treatment burden other risks from injections.<ref name="Sarwar">{{cite journal |vauthors = Sarwar S, Clearfield E, Soliman MK, Sadiq MA, Baldwin AJ, Hanout M, Agarwal A, Sepah YJ, Do DV, Nguyen QD |title= Aflibercept for neovascular age-related macular degeneration |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume=2 |pages= CD011346 |date=2016 |pmid= 26857947 |doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD011346.pub2}}</ref>

A 2017 review update studying the effects of anti-VEGF drugs on [[diabetic retinopathy|diabetic macular edema]] found that while all three studied treatments have advantages over laser therapy, there was moderate evidence that aflibercept is significantly favored in all measured efficacy outcomes over [[ranibizumab]] and [[bevacizumab]], after one year.<ref name="Virgili">{{cite journal |authors=Virgili G, Parravano M, Evans JR, Gordon I, Lucenteforte E |title= Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor for diabetic macular oedema: a network meta-analysis |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume=6 |pages= CD007419 |date=2017 |pmid= 28639415 |doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD007419.pub5}}</ref>

===Approvals===
In November 2011 the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved aflibercept (Eylea) for the treatment of wet macular degeneration.<ref>{{cite web|first= John | last= Gever |url= http://www.medpagetoday.com/Ophthalmology/GeneralOphthalmology/29811 |title=FDA Approves Eylea for Macular Degeneration |publisher=MedpageToday.com |date=November 19, 2011 |accessdate=2013-10-16}}</ref>

On August 3, 2012 the FDA approved aflibercept (Zaltrap) for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil, folinic acid and irinotecan to treat adults with metastatic colorectal cancer that is resistant to or has progressed following an [[oxaliplatin]]‑containing regimen.<ref name=ZaltrapFDA>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/ApprovedDrugs/ucm314438.htm |title=Ziv-Aflibercept| work=FDA Drug Approvals Database |publisher=Food and Drug Administration |date=August 3, 2012 |accessdate=2013-10-16}}</ref> To avoid confusion with Eylea, the FDA assigned a new name, ''ziv''-aflibercept, to the active ingredient.<ref>BioWorld: [http://www.bioworld.com/content/gpha-common-name-key-biosimilar-competition-1 GPhA: Common Name is Key to Biosimilar Competition]</ref>

In November 2012 the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) approved aflibercept for the treatment of wet macular degeneration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amd-fruehdiagnose.de/eylea/eylea-aflibercept-injection-approved-treatment-of-wet-age-related-macular-degeneration-europe.htm |title=Aflibercept Injection Approved for the Treatment of Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration in Europe |publisher=Amd-fruehdiagnose.de   |accessdate=2013-10-16}}</ref>

On February 1, 2013 the [[European Commission]] granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for treatment of adults with metastatic colorectal cancer for whom treatment based on oxaliplatin has not worked or the cancer got worse, in combination with the other drugs mentioned above.<ref>http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Summary_for_the_public/human/002532/WC500139486.pdf</ref>

===Reimbursement===
On 12 March 2015, aflibercept was one of a group of drugs delisted from the UK Cancer Drugs Fund.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cancer: Drugs:Written question - HL3340|url=http://www.parliament.uk/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/lords/2015-11-05/HL3340|publisher=UK Parliament|language=en|date=19 November 2015}}</ref>
