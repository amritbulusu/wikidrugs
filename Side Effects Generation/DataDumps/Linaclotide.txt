==Background==
===Medical need===
The [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) estimate that as many as 20% of Americans may experience irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); approximately one-third of those, as many as 10 million Americans, experience constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C), that is, IBS with constipation often accompanied by abdominal pain.{{verification needed|date=February 2017}}{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} [[Laxative]]s can assist with constipation but do not treat pain, while [[opiate]]s that are often prescribed to treat pain can aggravate constipation.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} While low-cost laxatives and pain killers would likely be tried first, linaclotide targets both associated conditions in a once-daily pill.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}<!--SCIENCE INFORMATION CANNOT ONLY BE SOURCED FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES.--><ref name=NYT>{{cite journal | author = Pollack, Andrew | date = September 13, 2010 | title = Drug for Irritable Bowel Achieves Goals in Trial | journal = [[The New York Times]] | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/health/research/14bowel.html | access-date = September 14, 2010}}</ref>

===Structure===
Linaclotide  is a [[peptide]] mimic of [[endogenous]] [[guanylin]] and [[uroguanylin]].<ref name=Hussain2015/><ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Love|first=Bryan L.|last2=Johnson|first2=Audrey|last3=Smith|first3=Lisa S. | date=2014 | title=Linaclotide: A Novel Agent For Chronic Constipation and Irritable Bowel Syndrome|url=http://www.ajhp.org/content/71/13/1081|journal=American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | volume=71 | issue=13 | pages=1081–1091 | doi=10.2146/ajhp130575 |issn=1079-2082|pmid=24939497}}</ref> It is a [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]] tetradecapeptide (14 [[amino acid]] peptide) with the sequence CCEYCCNPACTGCY by one-letter abbreviation,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} or by three-letter abbreviation:<ref name=Albericio/>

However, the actual structure of linaclotide is not fully specified without the three [[disulfide bond|disulfide]] (R-S-S-R) bonds it contains, which are between Cys<sup>1</sup> and Cys<sup>6</sup>, between Cys<sup>2</sup> and Cys<sup>10</sup>, and between Cys<sup>5</sup> and Cys<sup>13</sup>;<ref name=Albericio/> these are shown in exaggerated fashion in the line-angle graphic showing the chemical bonds within and between each amino acid (and their stereochemistries, see the infobox, above right), and are represented using a one-letter abbreviations in the following additional schematic:{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
[[File:Linaclotide schematic.svg|400px|center]]

===Mechanism of action===
Linaclotide, like the [[endogenous]] [[guanylin]] and [[uroguanylin]] it mimics, is an [[agonist]] that activates the [[cell surface receptor]] of [[guanylate cyclase 2C]] (GC-C).<ref name=Hussain2015/><ref name=PI>[http://www.allergan.com/assets/pdf/linzess_pi Linzess package insert], [[Allergan, Plc]], revised November 2015. Accessed August 18, 2016.</ref><ref name=":0"/> The medication binds to the surface of the [[intestine|intestinal]] [[epithelium|epithelial]] cells.<ref name=PI/> Linaclotide is minimally absorbed and it is undetectable in the systemic circulation at therapeutic doses.<ref name=Hussain2015/> Activation of GC-C increases [[cyclic guanosine monophosphate]] (cGMP).<ref name=PI/> Elevated cGMP stimulates secretion of chloride and bicarbonate and water into the intestinal lumen, mainly by way of [[cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator]] (CFTR) [[ion channel]] activation.<ref name=PI/><ref name=Yu2014/> This results in increased intestinal fluid and accelerated transit.<ref name=PI/> By elevating cGMP, linaclotide is also considered to reduce activation of colonic sensory neurons, reducing pain;<ref name=PI/><ref name=Corsetti2013/> and activates colonic motor neurons, which increases [[smooth muscle]] contraction and thus promotes bowel movements.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Related therapeutics===
[[Plecanatide]], a drug marketed under the name Trulance, was approved by the [[FDA]] in January 2017 for the treatment of [[chronic idiopathic constipation]] (CIC), and is likewise an [[agonist]] of [[guanylate cyclase 2C|guanylate cyclase]], except with hexadecapeptide structure.<ref>{{cite web|title=FDA approves Trulance for Chronic Idiopathic Constipation|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm537725.htm|website=FDA.gov|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=20 January 2017}}</ref>

==Clinical trials==
{{Expand section| an up-to-date and complete summary of all major clinical trials for the therapeutic | small = no | date=August 2016}} 
The FDA approval of linaclotide was based on four large randomized trials, two for each indication: IBS-C and CIC.<ref name=PI/>  The approved dose for constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) is 290 micrograms daily.<ref name=FDAnews/><ref name=":0" />  The approved dose for [[chronic idiopathic constipation]] (CIC) is 145 mcg daily; no benefit was seen in CIC by using 290 micrograms instead of 145 mcg daily.<ref name=PI/> In both situations, the most common side effect was [[diarrhea]].<ref name=PI/>

In IBS-C, the phase III randomized double-blind clinical trials both showed some improvement in pain and constipation with the medication in comparison to placebo.<ref name=PI/>{{rp|11–13}} Pain reduction started in the first week on the medication, with further improvement seen by weeks six to nine.<ref name=PI/>

In CIC, some effect on bowel habits was seen during the first week of treatment, reaching its maximum within that interval. Similarly, the effect returned toward baseline within one week of discontinuing the medication.<ref name=PI/>{{rp|13f}}<ref name=Corsetti2013/>{{rp|Fig.2B}} An open-label safety study in CIC using linaclotide for up to a year found diarrhea to be the most frequently reported adverse event.<ref name=Corsetti2013/>

==Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics==
{{Expand section| a source-based description of the PK and PD findings, a standard part of preclinical and early clinical drug discovery | small = no | date=August 2016}} 
Systemic absorption of the globular tetradecapeptide is minimal.<ref name=Hussain2015/><ref name=Corsetti2013/>

==Chemistry==
A study in discovery synthesis reported that 2 of 14 strategies available to synthesize linaclotide were successful—the successful ones involving [[trityl]] [[protecting group|protection]] of all cysteines, or trityl protection of all cysteines except Cys<sup>1</sup> and Cys<sup>6</sup>, which were protected with [[tert-butyl|''tert''-butyl groups]].  The study also reported that solution-phase oxidation (disulfide formation) was advisable over solid-supported synthesis for linaclotide, and that the Cys<sup>1</sup>–Cys<sup>6</sup> disulfide bridge was the most favored energetically.<ref name=Albericio/>

==Distribution and licensing==
Under a partnership agreement announced in 2007 between [[Forest Laboratories]] and Microbia (as [[Ironwood Pharmaceuticals]] was then known), Forest would pay $70 million in licensing fees towards the development of linaclotide, with profits shared between the two companies.<ref>{{cite journal | author = FDA News Staff | date = September 17, 2007 | title = Daily International Pharma Alert | journal = FDA News | volume = 4 | issue = 182 | url = http://fdanews.com/newsletter/article?issueId=10732&articleId=98561 | access-date = September 15, 2010}}</ref>
Distribution rights in the United States will be shared with Forest Laboratories, with [[Almirall]] distributing linaclotide in Europe and [[Astellas Pharma]] in Asia.<ref name=NYT/>
