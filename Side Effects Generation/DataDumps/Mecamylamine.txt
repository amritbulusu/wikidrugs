Chemically, mecamylamine is a secondary [[aliphatic]] [[amine]], with a pK<sub>aH</sub> of 11.2<ref name="pmid13476377">{{cite journal |vauthors=Schanker LS, Shore PA, Brodie BB, Hogben CA |title=Absorption of drugs from the stomach.

==Pharmacology and clinical applications==
Mecamylamine has been used as an orally-active [[ganglionic blocker]] in treating [[autonomic dysreflexia]] and [[hypertension]],<ref>{{cite book | author = T. O. Soine | date = 1966 | title = Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry | edition = 5th| editor = C. O. Wilson, O. Gisvold and R. F. Doerge | pages = 468–546 | location = Philadelphia | publisher = Lippincott}}</ref> but, like most ganglionic blockers, it is more often used now as a research tool.

Mecamylamine is also sometimes used as an [[antiaddictive]] drug to help people stop smoking tobacco,<ref name="pmid12080428">{{cite journal |vauthors=Shytle RD, Penny E, Silver AA, Goldman J, Sanberg PR |title=Mecamylamine (Inversine): an old antihypertensive with new research directions |journal=J Hum Hypertens |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=453–7 |date=July 2002 |pmid=12080428 |doi=10.1038/sj.jhh.1001416}}</ref> and is now more widely used for this application than it is for lowering blood pressure. This effect is thought to be due to its blocking [[Alpha-3 beta-4 nicotinic receptor|α3β4]] [[nicotinic receptors]] in the brain. It has also been reported to bring about sustained relief from tics in [[Tourette syndrome]] when a series of more usually used agents had failed.{{medcn|date=October 2016}}

In a recent double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II trial in Indian patients with major depression, (''S'')-mecamylamine (TC-5214) appeared to have efficacy as an [[Augmentation (psychiatry)|augmentation]] therapy.
