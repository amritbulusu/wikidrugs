'''Cyclazocine''' is a mixed [[opioid]] [[agonist]]/[[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] related to [[dezocine]], [[pentazocine]] and [[phenazocine]]. This family of opioid drugs is called the [[benzomorphan]]s or [[benzazocine]]s.<ref>{{ cite journal | author = Archer, S. | author2 = Glick, S. D. | author3 = Bidlack, J.

== Use ==
Research into the use of cyclazocine for the treatment of [[bipolar_disorder|bipolar]] patients with depression was undertaken by Fink and colleagues (1970). It showed that 8 out of 10 patients experienced moderate improvement.

Research during the 1960s and 1970s into the possible use of cyclazocine for management of pain, and later for assisting treatment of narcotic addiction was severely hampered by the drug's psychotomimetic, dysphoric, and hallucinatory effects.<ref>{{ cite journal | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/202/3/191.full.pdf | format = pdf | author = Freedman, A.
