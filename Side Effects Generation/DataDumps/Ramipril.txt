'''Ramipril''', sold under the brand name '''Altace''' among others, is an [[ACE inhibitor|angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor]], used to treat high blood pressure ([[hypertension]]) and [[congestive heart failure]]. By inhibiting an enzyme, ACE inhibitors relax the muscles around small arteries (arterioles). The arterioles expand and allow blood to flow through more easily. This reduces blood pressure.

==Medical uses==
Indications for its use include:
* High blood pressure
*Congestive heart failure<ref>{{Cite journal |author1= Pilote L |author2= Abrahamowicz M |author3= Eisenberg M |author4= Humphries K |author5= Behlouli H |author6= Tu JV |title=Effect of different angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors on mortality among elderly patients with congestive heart failure |journal=CMAJ |volume=178 |issue=10 |pages=1303–11 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18458262 |pmc=2335176 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.060068 |url=}}</ref>
*Following [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in patients with clinical evidence of [[heart failure]]
*Susceptible patients over 55 years: prevention of heart attack, [[stroke]], cardiovascular death, or need of [[revascularization]] procedures
*[[Diabetic nephropathy|kidney damage due to diabetes]] with [[microalbuminuria|protein in the urine]] (In low doses it is used as a prophylaxis for developing nephropathy and related secondary cardiovascular events.)<ref>{{cite journal|last=Remuzzi|first=Giuseppe|title=Prevention and Treatment of Diabetic Renal Disease in Type 2 Diabetes: The BENEDICT Study|journal=Journal of the American Society of Nephrology|date=April 2006|volume=14|series=2|issue=4|pages=590–597|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref>

==Contraindications==
Contraindications to its use include renovascular disease (impaired blood flow in the kidneys), severe renal impairment (especially in patients with one kidney or with bilateral [[renal artery stenosis]]), volume-depleted patients, a history of [[angioedema]] while on an [[ACE inhibitor]]s, [[pregnancy]], and [[hypotension]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Adverse effects==
*Shakiness
*[[Dry cough]]
*Dizziness and light-headedness due to low blood pressure
*Fatigue, especially in the early stages
*Mouth dryness in the early stages
*[[Nausea]]
*[[Fainting]]
*Signs of infection (e.g., fever, chills, persistent sore throat)
*Chest pain
*[[Neutropenia]] (low white blood cells)
*Impotence (erectile dysfunction)<ref>[http://heart-disease.emedtv.com/ramipril/ramipril-side-effects.html Med Tv]</ref>

Serious [[allergic reactions]] to this drug are unlikely, but immediate medical attention must be sought if they occur. Symptoms of a serious allergic reaction include, but are not limited to a [[rash]] or swelling of the face, mouth, tongue, or throat. In extreme cases, ramipril may lead to potentially fatal liver problems.

==Mechanism of action==
{{see also|Renin–angiotensin system}}
[[File:Ramipril 1.25 MG Oral Capsule.jpg|left|thumb|Ramipril 1.25-mg oral capsule, {{break}}letter codes and icons may differ]]

[[ACE inhibitor]]s inhibit the actions of [[angiotensin converting enzyme]] (ACE), thereby lowering the production of [[angiotensin II]] and decreasing the breakdown of [[bradykinin]]. The decrease in angiotensin II results in relaxation of [[arteriole]] smooth muscle leading to a decrease in [[total peripheral resistance]], reducing blood pressure as the blood is pumped through widened vessels. Its effect on bradykinin is responsible for the dry cough [[side effect]].

Ramipril, a [[prodrug]] or precursor drug, is converted to the active [[metabolite]] ramiprilat by [[carboxylesterase 1]].<ref Name=Frampton>{{Cite journal|vauthors =Frampton JE, Peters DH |title=Ramipril. An updated review of its therapeutic use in essential hypertension and heart failure |journal=Drugs |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=440–66 |date=March 1995|pmid=7774515 |doi= 10.2165/00003495-199549030-00008|url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid24141856">{{cite journal | author1 = Thomsen R | author2 = Rasmussen HB | author3 = Linnet K | author4 = INDICES Consortium. | title = In vitro drug metabolism by human carboxylesterase 1: focus on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors | journal = Drug Metab Dispos | volume =42 | issue = 1 | pages = 126–33 |date=Jan 2014 | pmid = 24141856 | doi = 10.1124/dmd.113.053512}}</ref> Ramiprilat is mostly [[excretion|excreted]] by the [[kidney]]s. Its [[half-life]] is variable (3–16 hours), and is prolonged by heart and [[liver failure]], as well as [[renal failure|kidney failure]].

==US patent==
The compound was protected by the {{US patent|5,061,722}} which was assigned to the German pharmaceutical company [[Hoechst AG]] (since merged into [[Aventis]]) on 29 October 1991. The patent was scheduled to expire on 29 October 2008. On 11 September  2007, in an appeal by the Indian company [[Lupin Ltd.]], the United States [[Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] reversed a district court trial verdict and found that Aventis's patent on ramipril was invalid for "obviousness", opening this drug to generic manufacturers.

==Brand names==
It is marketed as Prilace by [[Arrow Pharmaceuticals]] in [[Australia]], Ramipro by [[Westfield Pharma]] in the [[Philippines]], Tritace by [[Sanofi-Aventis]] in Italy and United States and Altace by [[King Pharmaceuticals]] in the [[United States]], Novapril by Pharmanova in [[Ghana]], Ramitens by PharmaSwiss, Ampril by Krka in Slovenia, Corpril by Cemelog-BRS in Hungary, Piramil and Prilinda by Hemofarm in Serbia, by Lek in Poland and by Novartis and Opsonin Pharma Limited as Ramace in Bangladesh, and in [[Canada]] as Altace (Sonfi) and Ramipril (Pharmascience).

Ramipril is marketed in [[India]] under the brand names of Cardace, Zigpril, Ramistar, Odipril and Zorem.

==Clinical trials==
The Heart Outcomes and Prevention Evaluation trial<ref>[http://www.hypertensiononline.org/slides2/slide01.cfm?q=ramipril&dpg=10 Hypertension Online Slides - ramipril, mortality, kidney failure, HOPE<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://ebm.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/5/2/47 Ramipril reduced mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in high risk adults - 5 (2): 47 - Evidence-Based Medicine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> seemed to show ramipril possessed cardioprotective qualities which extended beyond its qualities as an antihypertensive. However, the trial and the interpretation of its results have been criticised.<ref>http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/430926 "Debate: Do ACE Inhibitors Have Unique Properties, Beyond Their Antihypertensive Effect?"</ref>

The AIRE trial<ref name=Frampton/><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Effect of ramipril on mortality and morbidity of survivors of acute myocardial infarction with clinical evidence of heart failure. The Acute Infarction Ramipril Efficacy (AIRE) Study Investigators |journal=Lancet |volume=342 |issue=8875 |pages=821–8 |date=October 1993 |pmid=8104270 |doi=10.1016/0140-6736(93)92693-N |url=}}</ref> showed a 27% reduction in mortality for patients receiving ramipril for chronic heart failure following a [[myocardial infarction]].

Ramipril was found to have similar results as [[telmisartan]], an [[angiotensin II receptor antagonist|angiotensin II receptor blocker]].<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Yusuf S, Teo KK, Pogue J |display-authors=etal |title=Telmisartan, ramipril, or both in patients at high risk for vascular events |journal=N.
