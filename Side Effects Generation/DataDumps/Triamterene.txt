'''Triamterene''' (trade name '''Dyrenium''') is a [[potassium-sparing diuretic]] used in combination with [[thiazide]] diuretics for the treatment of [[hypertension]] and [[edema]]. In combination with [[hydrochlorothiazide]], it is marketed under the names '''Maxzide''' and '''Dyazide'''.

== Mechanism of action ==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2012}}
Triamterene directly blocks the [[epithelial sodium channel]]<ref name="pmid8772124">{{cite journal |author=Busch AE |author2=Suessbrich H |author3=Kunzelmann K |title=Blockade of epithelial Na+ channels by triamterenes - underlying mechanisms and molecular basis |journal=Pflugers Arch. |volume=432 |issue=5 |pages=760–6 |date=September 1996 |pmid=8772124 |doi= 10.1007/s004240050196 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> (ENaC) on the lumen side of the kidney [[collecting tubule]].<ref name=Burger/>{{rp|127}}  Other diuretics cause a decrease in the sodium concentration of the forming urine due to the entry of sodium into the cell via the ENaC, and the concomitant exit of potassium from the [[principal cell]] into the forming urine. Blocking ENaC prevents this from happening. [[Amiloride]] works in the same way. Sodium channel blockers directly inhibit the entry of sodium into the sodium channels.

== Side effects ==

{{refimprove section|date=June 2012}}
Common [[adverse drug reaction|side effects]] may include a depletion of [[sodium]], [[folic acid]] and [[calcium]], nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, fatigue, and dry mouth. Serious side effects may include heart palpitations, tingling/numbness, fever, chills, sore throat, rash, and back pain. Triamterene can also cause [[kidney stones]] through direct crystallization or by seeding [[calcium oxalate]] stones. Triamterene is best avoided in patients with chronic kidney disease due to the possibility of [[hyperkalemia]]. People using this drug should use [[salt substitute]] cautiously.<ref>LoSalt [http://www.losalt.com/docs/lo_salt_web_advice.pdf Advisory Statement] (PDF) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051210181911/http://www.losalt.com/docs/lo_salt_web_advice.pdf |date=December 10, 2005 }}</ref>

Triamterene may impart a blue fluorescent color to the urine.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

== Caution with certain disease states ==

{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
[[Diabetes]]: Use with caution in patients with prediabetes or diabetes mellitus as there may be a change in glucose control.

[[Hepatic impairment]]: Use with caution in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction; in cirrhosis, avoid electrolyte and acid/base imbalances that might lead to hepatic encephalopathy.

[[Kidney stones]]: Use with caution in patients with kidney stones.

Use should be avoided if the creatinine clearance is less than 10 ml/minute.

== With hydrochlorothiazide ==

Triamterene is commonly prepared in combination with [[hydrochlorothiazide]] for treatment of [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure) and [[edema]] (water retention). This combination is in a class of medications called [[diuretic]]s or 'water pills', and causes the [[kidney]]s to get rid of the body's unneeded water and [[sodium]] through the [[urine]].<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a601125.html "Triamterene and Hydrochlorothiazide"].

==History==
The triamterene ring system is found in many naturally occurring compounds, such as folic acid and riboflavin. The observation that the naturally occurring compound [[xanthopterin]] had renal affects led scientists at [[Smith Kline and French]] Laboratories in Philadelphia to begin a medicinal chemistry campaign to discover potential drugs, as part of a program to discover potassium-sparing diuretics.<ref name=Burger>{{cite book|last1=Fink|first1=Cynthia A|last2=McKenna|first2=Jeffrey M.|last3=Werner|first3=Lincoln H.|editor1-last=Abraham|editor1-first=Donald J.|title=Burger's medicinal chemistry and drug discovery.

The patents had expired on Dyazide in 1980, but complications arose with the introductions of generics, because the formulation of Dyazide resulted in variable batches that made it impossible for generic manufacturers to show that their versions were bioequivalent.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Boehm|first1=Garth|last2=Yao|first2=Lixin|last3=Han|first3=Liang|last4=Zheng|first4=Qiang|title=Development of the generic drug industry in the US after the Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984|journal=Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica B|date=September 2013|volume=3|issue=5|pages=297–311|doi=10.1016/j.apsb.2013.07.004|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211383513000762}}</ref><ref name=MylanHistDyazide>John Seaman and John T.

Bolar Pharmaceutical was in the running to be the first to bring a generic, but its application was delayed by these concerns about whether its formulation provided the same amount of each drug; these were complicated by accusations that Bolar had fraudulently substituted Dyazide for its own version to conduct studies that were submitted to the FDA.<ref name=Philly1987/>  Shortly after Bolar's generic was approved, further concerns were raised with regard to Bolar's applications to market generics more generally; these findings among others raised widespread concern among doctors and the public over whether generics were really the same as branded drugs.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Strickland|first1=Carol|title=Bolar: A Drug Company Under Siege|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/15/nyregion/bolar-a-drug-company-under-siege.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|date=15 October 1989}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Cimons|first1=Marlene|title=FDA to Lift OK of Last Dyazide Generic Version|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-08-29/news/mn-1184_1_generic-drug|work=Los Angeles Times|date=29 August 1989}}</ref>  Bolar ended up recalling its generic form of Dyazide and withdrawing the product in 1990.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bolar Recalls Generic Version Of Dyazide And Extended Release Phenytoin, Saying "Bioequivalence Cannot Be Assured"; Products; Represent 52% of Sales|url=https://pink.pharmamedtechbi.com/PS016884/BOLAR-RECALLS-GENERIC-VERSION-OF-DYAZIDE-AND-EXTENDED-RELEASE-PHENYTOIN-SAYING-BIOEQUIVALENCE-CANNOT-BE-ASSURED-PRODUCTSampnbspREPRESENT-52-OF-SALES|work=Pink Sheet|date=February 5, 1990}}</ref>   In 1991 the US Justice Department on behalf of the FDA filed 20 criminal charges against Bolar for its fraud,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shaw|first1=Donna|title=U.s.

[[Mylan]] itself developed a version of a triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide combination drug after the Dyazide patent expired, and used a different, more stable formulation<ref name=MylanHistDyazide/> as well as different dosages of each active ingredient (50&nbsp;mg hydrochlorothiazide and 75&nbsp;mg triamterene, compared with Dyazide's 25&nbsp;mg hydrochlorothiazide and 50&nbsp;mg triamterene) so it had to get approval as a new drug, as opposed to a generic; their product was called Maxzide and was approved in 1984.<ref>FDA [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.Set_Current_Drug&ApplNo=019129&DrugName=MAXZIDE&ActiveIngred=HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE%3B%20TRIAMTERENE&SponsorApplicant=MYLAN%20PHARMS%20INC&ProductMktStatus=1&goto=Search.Label_ApprovalHistory Approval History NDA 019129: Maxzide] Page accessed Sept 8, 2016</ref><ref name=MaxApprovable>Pink Sheet Oct 22, 1984 [https://pink.pharmamedtechbi.com/PS007364/MYLANs-MAXZIDE-IS-APPROVABLE-AT-FDA-LEDERLE-TO-MARKET-BRAND-COMPETITION-TO-SMITHKLINEs-No-3RANKED-DYAZIDE-FINAL-APPROVAL-ANTICIPATED-IMMINENTLY Mylan's Maxzide is "Approvable" at FDA: Lederle To Market Brand Competition to Smithkline's No. 3-Ranked Dyazide; Final Approval Anticipated "Imminently"]</ref>  The higher dose allowed once per day dosing, which Mylan and its marketing partner, Lederle, believed would help it compete against Dyazide, which had $210M in sales in 1983.<ref name=MaxApprovable/>
