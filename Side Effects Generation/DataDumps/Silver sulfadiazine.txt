== Medical uses ==
Tentative evidence has found other antibiotics to be more effective in the healing of superficial and partial thickness burn injuries; therefore, it is no longer generally recommended.<ref name=Was2013/><ref name=Hey2016/> A [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane]] review from 2013 found that most of the trials that met inclusion criteria for the review had methodological shortcomings and thus are of little use in assessing the efficacy of silver sulfadiazine in the healing of burn injuries.<ref name=Was2013 /> Another Cochrane systematic review from 2010 concluded, "There is insufficient evidence to establish whether silver-containing dressings or topical agents promote wound healing or prevent wound infection".<ref name=Dress2010>{{cite journal|last=Storm-Versloot|first=MN|author2=Vos, CG |author3=Ubbink, DT |author4= Vermeulen, H |title=Topical silver for preventing wound infection|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=Mar 17, 2010|issue=3|pages=CD006478|pmid=20238345|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006478.pub2|editor1-last=Storm-Versloot|editor1-first=Marja N}}</ref> Other reviews of the evidence have also concluded, "[the] quality of the trials was limited".<ref name="systematic1973">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lo SF, Hayter M, Chang CJ, Hu WY, Lee LL |title=A systematic review of silver-releasing dressings in the management of infected chronic wounds |journal=Journal of clinical nursing |volume=17|issue=15|pages=1973–85|year=2008|pmid=18705778 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2702.2007.02264.x}}</ref> Cochrane has raised concerns about delays in time to wound healing when SSD is used.<ref name="Was2013" />

== Adverse effects ==
A noninfection-related clear fluid may form on the wound's surface. Burning and painful sensations are not uncommon but are only temporary.

About 0.1 to 1.0% of people show [[hypersensitivity]] reactions such as [[rashes]] or [[erythema multiforme]].<ref name="Austria-Codex" /> This reaction is known from other sulfonamides including antibacterials, [[thiazide]] diuretics, and [[sulfonylurea]] antidiabetics; but data on the likelihood of cross-allergies are inconsistent.

Incorporation of the silver [[ion]]s can lead to local [[argyria]] (discoloration of the skin), especially if the treated area is exposed to [[ultraviolet]] light. Generalised argyria with silver accumulation in kidneys, liver, and [[retina]] has only been found in association with excessive long-term use, or repeated use on severe and heavily inflamed burns. Possible consequences of generalised argyria include [[interstitial nephritis]] and [[anemia]].<ref name="Austria-Codex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Jasek, W|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2007|edition=62|volume=2|pages=3270–1|isbn=978-3-85200-181-4|language=German}}</ref>

== Interactions ==
[[Protease]]s such as [[trypsin]] and [[clostridiopeptidase]], which are contained in ointments used for the removal of dead skin on wounds, can be inhibited by silver ions if applied simultaneously. When silver sulfadiazine is absorbed in significant amounts, it can increase effects and side effects of some drugs such as [[vitamin K antagonist]]s.<ref name="Austria-Codex" />

== Pharmacokinetics ==
The chemical is poorly soluble, and has only very limited penetration through the skin. Only when applied to large-area burns or other lesions is absorption into the body a problem.<ref name="Austria-Codex" />

== Names ==
Brand names include Silvadene (a [[genericized trademark]]), Silverex, Silverol, Silvazine, Flamazine, Thermazene, BurnHeal, and SSD.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drugs.com/mtm/ssd.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417030400/http://www.drugs.com/mtm/ssd.html |archivedate=2011-04-17 |df= }} This source names Silvadene, SSD, SSD AF, Thermazene</ref>
