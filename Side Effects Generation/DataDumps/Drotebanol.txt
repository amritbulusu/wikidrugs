'''Drotebanol''' ('''Oxymethebanol''') is a [[morphinan]] derivative that acts as an [[opioid]] agonist. It was invented by [[Daiichi Sankyo Co.|Sankyo Company]] in Japan during the 1970s. It is synthesised from [[thebaine]]. 

Drotebanol has powerful [[antitussive]] (cough suppressant) effects, and is around 10x more potent than codeine in producing this effect. It also has analgesic effects several times stronger than codeine, but weaker than morphine.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kobayashi | first1 = S | last2 = Hasegawa | first2 = K | last3 = Mori | first3 = M | last4 = Takagi | first4 = H | title = Pharmacological studies on a new specifically potent antitussive agent, 14-hydroxydihydro-6 beta-thebainol-4-methylether (oxymethebanol) | journal = Arzneimittel-Forschung | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 43–6 | year = 1970 | pmid = 5467447 }}</ref> In animal studies it was found to be moderately addictive and produced limited physical dependence, but not as severe as that seen with morphine or pethidine.<ref>[http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1977-01-01_1_page005.html Yanagita T, Miyasato K, Oinuma N, Kiyohara H.

It is currently a Schedule I Narcotic controlled substance in the United States with a DEA ACSCN of 9335 and an annual aggregate manufacturing quota of zero.
