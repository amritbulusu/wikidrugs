The '''cannabinoid receptor type 1''', often abbreviated as '''CB<sub>1</sub>''', is a [[G protein-coupled receptor|G protein-coupled]] [[cannabinoid receptor]] located primarily in the central and peripheral nervous system. It is activated by the [[endocannabinoid#Endocannabinoids|endocannabinoid]] [[neurotransmitter]]s [[anandamide]] and 2-arachidonoylglycerol ([[2-AG]]); by plant [[cannabinoid]]s, such as the compound [[tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]], an active ingredient of the [[psychoactive drug]] [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]; and by synthetic analogues of THC. CB1 and THC are deactivated by the phytocannabinoid [[tetrahydrocannabivarin]] (THCV).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Adèle|last2=Stevenson|first2=Lesley A|last3=Wease|first3=Kerrie N|last4=Price|first4=Martin R|last5=Baillie|first5=Gemma|last6=Ross|first6=Ruth A|last7=Pertwee|first7=Roger G|date=December 2005|title=Evidence that the plant cannabinoid Δ9-tetrahydrocannabivarin is a cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptor antagonist|journal=British Journal of Pharmacology|volume=146|issue=7|pages=917–926|doi=10.1038/sj.bjp.0706414|issn=0007-1188|pmc=1751228|pmid=16205722}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pertwee|first=R G|last2=Thomas|first2=A|last3=Stevenson|first3=L A|last4=Ross|first4=R A|last5=Varvel|first5=S A|last6=Lichtman|first6=A H|last7=Martin|first7=B R|last8=Razdan|first8=R K|date=March 2007|title=The psychoactive plant cannabinoid, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, is antagonized by Δ8- and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabivarin in mice in vivo|journal=British Journal of Pharmacology|volume=150|issue=5|pages=586–594|doi=10.1038/sj.bjp.0707124|issn=0007-1188|pmc=2189766|pmid=17245367}}</ref>

==Mechanism==
The CB<sub>1</sub> receptor is a pre-synaptic [[heteroreceptor]] that modulates neurotransmitter release when activated in a dose-dependent, stereoselective and pertussis toxin-sensitive manner.<ref name="entrez" /> The CB<sub>1</sub> receptor is activated by [[cannabinoids]], generated naturally inside the body ([[Cannabinoids#Endocannabinoids|endocannabinoids]]) or introduced into the body as [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] or a related [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] compound.

Research suggests that the majority of CB<sub>1</sub> receptors are coupled through G<sub>i/o</sub> proteins. Upon activation, CB<sub>1</sub> receptor exhibits its effects mainly through activation of [[Gi alpha subunit|G<sub>i</sub>]], which decreases intracellular cAMP concentration by inhibiting its production [[enzyme]], [[adenylate cyclase]], and increases [[mitogen-activated protein kinase]] (MAP kinase) concentration. Alternatively, in some rare cases CB<sub>1</sub> receptor activation may be coupled to [[Gs alpha subunit|G<sub>s</sub>]] proteins, which stimulate [[adenylate cyclase]].<ref name="pmid16570099" /> cAMP is known to serve as a second messenger coupled to a variety of ion channels, including the positively influenced [[Inward-rectifier potassium ion channel|inwardly rectifying potassium channels]] (=Kir or IRK),<ref name="pmid16109430">{{cite journal | vauthors = Demuth DG, Molleman A | title = Cannabinoid signalling | journal = Life Sciences | volume = 78 | issue = 6 | pages = 549–63 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16109430 | doi = 10.1016/j.lfs.2005.05.055 }}</ref> and [[calcium channel]]s, which are activated by cAMP-dependent interaction with such molecules as [[protein kinase A]] (PKA), [[protein kinase C]] (PKC), [[C-Raf|Raf-1]], [[Extracellular signal-regulated kinases|ERK]], [[JNK]], [[p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases|p38]], [[c-fos]], [[c-jun]], and others.<ref name="endocrino" /> In terms of function, the inhibition of intracellular cAMP expression shortens the duration of pre-synaptic action potentials by  prolonging the rectifying potassium A-type currents, which is normally inactivated upon phosphorylation by PKA. This inhibition grows more pronounced when considered with the effect of activated CB<sub>1</sub> receptors to limit calcium entry into the cell, which does not occur through cAMP but by a direct G-protein-mediated inhibition. As presynaptic calcium entry is a requirement for vesicle release, this function will decrease the transmitter that enters the synapse upon release.<ref name="pmid11316486">{{cite journal | vauthors = Elphick MR, Egertová M | title = The neurobiology and evolution of cannabinoid signalling | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

In summary, CB<sub>1</sub> receptor activity has been found to be coupled to certain ion channels, in the following manner:<ref name="pmid16570099" />
* Positively to inwardly rectifying and A-type outward potassium channels.
* Negatively to D-type outward potassium channels
* Negatively to N-type and P/Q-type calcium channels.

==Expression==
The CB<sub>1</sub> receptor is encoded by the gene ''CNR1,''<ref name="entrez">{{cite web |title=Entrez Gene: CNR1 cannabinoid receptor 1 (brain) |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=1268 |accessdate=}}</ref> located on human chromosome 6.<ref name="pmid11316486" /> Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene.<ref name="entrez" /> CNR1 [[orthologs]]<ref name="OrthoMaM">{{cite web |title=OrthoMaM phylogenetic marker: CNR1 coding sequence |url=http://www.orthomam.univ-montp2.fr/orthomam/data/cds/detailMarkers/ENSG00000118432_CNR1.xml}}</ref> have been identified in most [[mammals]].

The CB<sub>1</sub> receptor is expressed pre-synaptically at both glutaminergic and GABAergic interneurons and, in effect, acts as a [[neuromodulator]] to inhibit release of [[glutamate]] and [[GABA]].<ref name="pmid11316486" /> Repeated administration of receptor agonists may result in receptor internalization and/ or a reduction in receptor protein signalling.<ref name="pmid16570099" />

===Brain===
[[File:CNR1, ISH, mouse.jpg|thumbnail|left|[http://developingmouse.brain-map.org/data/Cnr1/100015330.html?ispopup=true Cnr1] is widely expressed in all major regions of the postnatal day 14 mouse brain, but is conspicuously absent in much of the thalamus. [[Allen Brain Atlas]]es]]
CB<sub>1</sub> receptors are expressed most densely in the central nervous system and are largely responsible for mediating the effects of cannabinoid binding in the brain.  Endocannabinoids released by a depolarized neuron bind to CB<sub>1</sub> receptors on pre-synaptic glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, resulting in a respective decrease in either glutamate or GABA release. Limiting glutamate release causes reduced excitation, while limiting GABA release suppresses inhibition, a common form of short-term [[synaptic plasticity|plasticity]] in which the depolarization of a single neuron induces a reduction in [[GABA]]-mediated inhibition, in effect exciting the postsynaptic cell.<ref name="pmid11316486" />

Varying levels of CB<sub>1</sub> expression can be detected in the [[olfactory bulb]], [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] regions ([[neocortex]], [[Piriform cortex|pyriform cortex]], [[hippocampus]], and [[amygdala]]), several parts of [[basal ganglia]], [[thalamus|thalamic]] and [[hypothalamus|hypothalamic]] nuclei, and other subcortical regions (e.g., the [[septal nuclei|septal region]]), [[cerebellar cortex]], and [[brainstem]] nuclei (e.g., the [[periaqueductal gray]]).<ref name="endocrino">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pagotto U, Marsicano G, Cota D, Lutz B, Pasquali R | title = The emerging role of the endocannabinoid system in endocrine regulation and energy balance | journal = Endocrine Reviews | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 73–100 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16306385 | doi = 10.1210/er.2005-0009 }}</ref>

====Hippocampal formation====
CB<sub>1</sub> mRNA transcripts are abundant in GABAergic interneurons of the hippocampus, indirectly reflecting the expression of these receptors and elucidating the established effect of cannabinoids on memory. These receptors are densely located in [[CA1-CA4|cornu ammonis]] pyramidal cells, which are known to release glutamate. Cannabinoids suppress the induction of LTP and LTD in the hippocampus by inhibiting these glutamatergic neurons. By reducing the concentration of glutamate released below the threshold necessary to depolarize the postynaptic receptor [[NMDA receptor|NMDA]],<ref name="pmid11316486" /> a receptor known to be directly related to the induction of LTP and LTD, cannabinoids are a crucial factor in the selectivity of memory.
These receptors are highly expressed by GABAergic interneurons as well as glutamatergic principal neurons. However, a higher density is found within GABAergic cells.<ref name="pmid17828291">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pertwee RG | title = The diverse CB1 and CB2 receptor pharmacology of three plant cannabinoids: Δ<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol and Δ<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabivarin | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 153 | issue = 2 | pages = 199–215 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 17828291 | pmc = 2219532 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bjp.0707442 }}</ref> This means that, although synaptic strength/frequency, and thus potential to induce LTP, is lowered, net hippocampal activity is raised. In addition, CB<sub>1</sub> receptors in the hippocampus indirectly inhibit the release of [[acetylcholine]]. This serves as the modulatory axis opposing GABA, decreasing neurotransmitter release. Cannabinoids also likely play an important role in the development of memory through their neonatal promotion of [[myelin]] formation, and thus the individual segregation of axons.

====Basal ganglia====
CB<sub>1</sub> receptors are expressed throughout the [[basal ganglia]] and have well-established effects on movement in rodents. As in the hippocampus, these receptors inhibit the release of glutamate or GABA transmitter, resulting in decreased excitation or reduced inhibition based on the cell they are expressed in. Consistent with the variable expression of both excitatory glutamate and inhibitory GABA interneurons in both the basal ganglia's direct and indirect motor loops, synthetic cannabinoids are known to influence this system in a dose-dependent triphasic pattern. Decreased locomotor activity is seen at both higher and lower concentrations of applied cannabinoids, whereas an enhancement of movement may occur upon moderate dosages.<ref name="pmid11316486" />  However, these dose-dependent effects have been studied predominately in rodents, and the physiological basis for this triphasic pattern warrants future research in humans. Effects may vary based on the site of cannabinoid application, input from higher cortical centers, and whether drug application is unilateral or bilateral.

====Cerebellum and neocortex====
The role of the CB<sub>1</sub> receptor in the regulation of motor movements is complicated by the additional expression of this receptor in the [[cerebellum]] and [[neocortex]], two regions associated with the coordination and initiation of movement. Research suggests that anandamide is synthesized by Purkinje cells and acts on presynaptic receptors to inhibit glutamate release from granule cells or GABA release from the terminals of basket cells. In the neocortex, these receptors are concentrated on local interneurons in cerebral layers II-III and V-VI.<ref name="pmid11316486" /> Compared to rat brains, humans express more CB<sub>1</sub> receptors in the cerebral cortex and amygdala and less in the cerebellum, which may help explain why motor function seems to be more compromised in rats than humans upon cannabinoid application.<ref name="pmid17828291" />

===Spine===
Many of the documented analgesic effects of cannabinoids are based on the interaction of these compounds with CB<sub>1</sub> receptors on [[spinal cord]] interneurons in the superficial levels of the [[Posterior horn of spinal cord|dorsal horn]], known for its role in nociceptive processing. In particular, the CB<sub>1</sub> is heavily expressed in layers 1 and 2 of the spinal cord dorsal horn and in lamina 10 by the central canal. Dorsal root ganglion also express these receptors, which target a variety of peripheral terminals involved in nociception. Signals on this track are also transmitted to the [[periaqueductal gray]] (PAG) of the midbrain. Endogenous cannabinoids are believed to exhibit an analgesic effect on these receptors by limiting both GABA and glutamate of PAG cells that relate to nociceptive input processing, a hypothesis consistent with the finding that anandamide release in the PAG is increased in response to pain-triggering stimuli.<ref name="pmid11316486" />

===Other===
CB<sub>1</sub> is expressed on several types of cell in [[pituitary gland]], [[thyroid gland]], and possibly in the [[adrenal gland]].<ref name="endocrino" /> CB<sub>1</sub> is also expressed in several cells relating to metabolism, such as [[Adipocyte|fat cells]], [[Muscle fiber|muscle cells]], [[Hepatocyte|liver cells]] (and also in the [[Endothelium|endothelial cells]], [[Kupffer cell]]s and [[Hepatic stellate cell|stellate cells]] of the [[liver]]), and in the [[Gastrointestinal tract|digestive tract]].<ref name="endocrino" /> These receptor also expressed in the [[lungs]] and the [[kidney]].

CB<sub>1</sub> is present on [[Leydig cells]] and human [[Spermatozoon|sperms]]. In [[females]], it is present in the [[ovarium|ovaries]], [[oviduct]]s [[myometrium]], [[decidua]], and [[placenta]]. It has also been implicated in the proper development of the [[embryo]].<ref name="endocrino" />

== Function ==

===Health and disease===
Several studies have implicated the CB<sub>1</sub> receptor in the maintenance of homeostasis in health and disease. In a rodent neuropathic pain model, increased expression of these receptors was seen in thalamic neurons, the spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglion.<ref name="pmid17828291" /> Increased receptor expression has also been found in human [[hepatocellular]] [[carcinoma]] tumor samples and other human [[prostate cancer]] cells. The expression of these receptors is believed to modulate neurotransmitter release  in a manner that prevents the development of excessive neuronal activity, reducing pain and other inflammatory symptoms. This finding is consistent with the localization of CB<sub>1</sub> receptors to the terminals of central and peripheral neurons, and the established mediation of both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters [[acetylcholine]], [[noradrenaline]], [[dopamine]], [[5-HT]], [[GABA]], [[glutamate]], [[D-aspartate]], and [[cholecystokinin]].<ref name="pmid17828291" /> Through its primary action as a G<sub>i</sub> coupled receptor, CB1 inhibits production of [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate]] (cAMP), metabotropically inhibiting all NT release.

Enhanced receptor expression following disease has been found to result in a leftward shift in the log dose-response curve of cannabinol, and also an increase in the size of its maximal effects.<ref name="pmid17828291" />

===Anxiety response to novelty===
A CB<sub>1</sub> receptor knock-out mouse study examined the effect that these receptors play on exploratory behavior in novel situations. Researchers selectively targeted glutamatergic and GABAergic cortical interneurons and studied results in open field, novel object, and sociability tests. Eliminating glutamatergic cannabinoid receptors led to decreased object exploration, social interactions, and increased aggressive behavior. In contrast, GABAergic cannabinoid receptor-knockout mice showed increased exploration of objects, socialization, and open field movement.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Häring M, Kaiser N, Monory K, Lutz B | title = Circuit specific functions of cannabinoid CB1 receptor in the balance of investigatory drive and exploration | journal = PloS One | volume = 6 | issue = 11 | pages = e26617 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22069458 | pmc = 3206034 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0026617 | editor1-last = Burgess | bibcode = 2011PLoSO...626617H | editor1-first = Harold A. }}</ref> These opposing effects reveal the importance of the endocannabinoid system in regulating anxiety-dependent behavior. Glutamatergic CB<sub>1</sub>receptors not only are responsible for mediating aggression but produce anxiolytic-like function by inhibiting excessive arousal, which prevented the mice from exploring both animate and inanimate objects. In contrast, GABAergic CB<sub>1</sub> receptors appear to control an anxiogenic-like function by limiting inhibitory transmitter release. Taken together, these results illustrate the regulatory function of the CB<sub>1</sub> receptor on the organism's overall sense of arousal during novel situations and suggest that investigatory drive is associated with impulsive behavior.

Another study found that differential synthesis of anandamide and 2-AG in response to stress mediated beneficial effects of the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]]. These effects were eliminated by the application of the CB<sub>1</sub> antagonist [[AM251]], illustrating that this receptor is essential for modulating the function of the stress response.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hill MN, McLaughlin RJ, Bingham B, Shrestha L, Lee TT, Gray JM, Hillard CJ, Gorzalka BB, Viau V | title = Endogenous cannabinoid signaling is essential for stress adaptation | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 | issue = 20 | pages = 9406–11 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20439721 | pmc = 2889099 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0914661107 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..107.9406H }}</ref>

===Gastrointestinal activity===
Inhibition of [[Gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] activity has been observed after administration of [[THC]] or [[anandamide]]. This effect is assumed to be CB<sub>1</sub>-mediated, since this receptor is expressed by the [[peptide hormone]] [[cholecystokinin]], and application of the CB<sub>1</sub>-specific inverse agonist SR 141716A ([[Rimonabant]]) blocks the effect. Another report, however, suggests that inhibition of [[intestine|intestinal]] [[motility]] may also have a [[Cannabinoid receptor 2 (macrophage)|CB<sub>2</sub>]]-mediated component.<ref name="pmid15249429">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mathison R, Ho W, Pittman QJ, Davison JS, Sharkey KA | title = Effects of cannabinoid receptor-2 activation on accelerated gastrointestinal transit in lipopolysaccharide-treated rats | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 142 | issue = 8 | pages = 1247–54 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15249429 | pmc = 1575196 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bjp.0705889 }}</ref>

The CB<sub>1</sub> receptor [[inverse agonist]] [[rimonabant]] has been found to reduce intake of food or sweet solutions in both humans and mice.

Effects vary based on the endocannabinoid molecule: 2-AG was found to act on presynaptic CB<sub>1</sub> receptors to mediate retrograde [[short-term depression]] following activation of L-type calcium currents, whereas anandamide was synthesized after mGluR5 activation and triggered [[autocrine signalling]] that induced [[long-term depression]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Puente N, Cui Y, Lassalle O, Lafourcade M, Georges F, Venance L, Grandes P, Manzoni OJ | title = Polymodal activation of the endocannabinoid system in the extended amygdala | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 14 | issue = 12 | pages = 1542–7 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 22057189 | doi = 10.1038/nn.2974 }}</ref>  These findings demonstrate the CB<sub>1</sub> receptor as a direct mechanism for the brain to selectively inhibit neuronal excitability over variable time scales. By selectively internalizing different receptors, the brain may limit the production of specific endocannabinoids to favor a time scale in accordance with its needs. mGlu5 forms a heterodimer with A2A, which allows endocannabinoids to regulate their own levels, as they inhibit cAMP production, thus increase free adenosine to agonise A2A. This forms a feedback loop between the positive and negative metabotropic receptors, which can maintain a relatively similar homeostasis with any neuron connected through an electrical synapse.

===Motor control===
CB<sub>1</sub> receptors are expressed throughout motor regions of the mammalian brain, suggesting that CB<sub>1</sub> has a role in motor control. CB<sub>1</sub> activation has been shown to effect specific kinematic variables in rodents, such as the rate of applied force during lever pressing,<ref name="McLaughlin">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mclaughlin PJ, Delevan CE, Carnicom S, Robinson JK, Brener J | title = Fine motor control in rats is disrupted by delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol | journal = Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Behavior | volume = 66 | issue = 4 | pages = 803–9 | date = August 2000 | pmid = 10973519 | doi = 10.1016/S0091-3057(00)00281-1 }}</ref> and the amplitude (but not timing) of whisker movements.<ref name="Pietr">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pietr MD, Knutsen PM, Shore DI, Ahissar E, Vogel Z | title = Cannabinoids reveal separate controls for whisking amplitude and timing in rats | journal = Journal of Neurophysiology | volume = 104 | issue = 5 | pages = 2532–42 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 20844105 | doi = 10.1152/jn.01039.2009 }}</ref>

===Drug and behavioral addictions===
Several recent reviews on CB1 receptors and addiction have indicated that CB1 receptor activation reinstates drug seeking behavior in addicts.<ref name="pmid15992935">{{cite journal | vauthors = De Vries TJ, Schoffelmeer AN | title = Cannabinoid CB1 receptors control conditioned drug seeking | journal = Trends in Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 26 | issue = 8 | pages = 420–6 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 15992935 | doi = 10.1016/j.tips.2005.06.002 }}</ref><ref name="pmid18482432">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wiskerke J, Pattij T, Schoffelmeer AN, De Vries TJ | title = The role of CB1 receptors in psychostimulant addiction | journal = Addiction Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 225–38 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18482432 | doi = 10.1111/j.1369-1600.2008.00109.x }}</ref><ref name="pmid23108546" />
In humans, this results from the influence that [[limbic system|limbic]] CB1 receptors have on [[mesolimbic pathway|mesolimbic]] dopamine neurons, specifically [[dopamine receptor]]s in the [[nucleus accumbens]].<ref name="pmid23108546">{{cite journal | vauthors = Melis M, Pistis M | title = Hub and switches: endocannabinoid signalling in midbrain dopamine neurons | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences | volume = 367 | issue = 1607 | pages = 3276–85 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23108546 | pmc = 3481525 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2011.0383 }}</ref> As a consequence, [[Cannabinoid receptor antagonist|CB1 receptor antagonists]] can reduce drug seeking behavior in some addicts.<ref name="pmid15992935" /><ref name="pmid18482432" /><ref name="pmid23108546" />

===Olfaction===
The CB<sub>1</sub> receptor is expressed by a number of neurons that project from the [[anterior olfactory nucleus]] to the [[ipsilateral]] main [[olfactory bulb]]. However, the effects of cannabinoids on synaptic activity in these neurons has not been well-studied and its effects on olfaction warrant further research in rodents.<ref name="pmid11316486" /> Cannabinoids are not known to have effects on olfaction in humans. However, as with the rest of the brain, it plays a crucial role in modulation of NT release.

==Use of antagonists==
Selective CB<sub>1</sub> agonists may be used to isolate the effects of the receptor from the CB<sub>2</sub> receptor, as most cannabinoids and endocannabinoids bind to both receptor types.<ref name="pmid11316486" />
[[Cannabinoid receptor antagonist|CB<sub>1</sub> selective antagonists]] are used for weight reduction and [[smoking cessation]] (see [[Rimonabant]]). A substantial number of antagonists of the CB1 receptor have been discovered and characterized. [[TM38837]] has been developed as a CB1 receptor antagonist that is restricted to targeting only peripheral CB1 receptors. <!--What does this have to do with CB1 antagonists?: Activation of CB<sub>1</sub> provides neuroprotection after brain injury.<ref name="pmid11586361">{{Cite pmid|11586361}}</ref> -->
