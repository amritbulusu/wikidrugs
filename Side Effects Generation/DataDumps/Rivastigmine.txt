'''Rivastigmine''' (sold under the trade name '''Exelon''') is a [[parasympathomimetics|parasympathomimetic]] or [[cholinergic]] agent for the treatment of mild to moderate [[Alzheimer's disease|dementia of the Alzheimer's type]] and dementia due to [[Parkinson's disease]]. The drug can be administered orally or via a [[transdermal patch]]; the latter form reduces the prevalence of side effects,<ref name=Winblad/> which typically include nausea and vomiting.<ref name=Inglis/>  

The drug is eliminated through the urine, and appears to have relatively few drug-drug interactions.<ref name="Inglis" />

==Medical uses==
Rivastigmine capsules, liquid solution and patches are used for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the [[Alzheimer's]] type and for mild to moderate dementia related to [[Parkinson's disease]].

Rivastigmine has demonstrated treatment effects on the cognitive (thinking and memory), functional (activities of daily living) and behavioural problems commonly associated with Alzheimer's<ref>{{cite journal |first1=J. |last1=Corey-Bloom |first2=R. |last2=Anand |first3=J. |last3=Veach |year=1998 |title=A randomized trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of ENA 713 (rivastigmine tartrate), a new acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, in patients with mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's disease |journal=International Journal of Geriatric Psychopharmacology |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=55–65 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284814323_A_randomized_trial_evaluating_the_efficacy_and_safety_of_ENA_713_rivastigmine_tartrate_a_new_acetylcholinesterase_inhibitor_in_patients_with_mild_to_moderately_severe_Alzheimer%27s_disease }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Rosler | first1 = M. | last2 = Anand | first2 = R. | last3 = Cicin-Sain | first3 = A. | last4 = Gauthier | first4 = S. | last5 = Agid | first5 = Y. | last6 = Dal-Bianco | first6 = P. | last7 = Stähelin | first7 = H.

===Efficacy===
In people with either type of dementia, rivastigmine has been shown to provide meaningful symptomatic effects that may allow patients to remain independent and ‘be themselves’ for longer. In particular, it appears to show marked treatment effects in patients showing a more aggressive course of disease, such as those with younger onset ages, poor nutritional status, or those experiencing symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite journal | last1 = Gauthier | first1 = S. | last2 = Vellas | first2 = B. | last3 = Farlow | first3 = M. | last4 = Burn | first4 = D. | title = Aggressive course of disease in dementia | doi = 10.1016/j.jalz.2006.03.002 | journal = Alzheimer's & Dementia | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 210–217 | year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref>  For example, the presence of hallucinations appears to be a predictor of especially strong responses to rivastigmine, both in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's  patients.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{Cite journal | last1 = Touchon | first1 = J. | last2 = Bergman | first2 = H. | last3 = Bullock | first3 = R. | last4 = Rapatz | first4 = G.

No firm evidence supports usage in schizophrenia patients.

Its efficacy is similar to donepezil and [[tacrine]]. Doses below 6&nbsp;mg/d may be ineffective. The effects of this kind of drug in different kinds of dementia (including Alzheimer's dementia) are modest, and it is still unclear which AcCh(ButCh) esterase inhibitor is better in Parkinson's dementia, though rivastigmine is well-studied.

==Side effects==
Side effects may include nausea and vomiting, decreased appetite and weight loss.<ref name=Inglis/>

The strong potency of rivastigmine, provided by its dual inhibitory mechanism, has been postulated to lead to more nausea and vomiting during the titration phase of oral rivastigmine treatment.<ref name=Inglis/> This enforces the importance of taking oral forms of these drugs with food as prescribed.<ref name="ProductInsert"/>   However, rates of nausea and vomiting are markedly reduced with the once-daily rivastigmine patch (which can be applied at any time of the day, with or without food).
Patients and caregivers should be aware of warning signs of potential toxicities and know when to call their doctor. For the patch and oral formulations, skin rashes can occur at which time patients should contact their doctor immediately.<ref name="pharma.us.novartis.com"/> For the patch, patients and caregivers should monitor for any intense itching, redness, swelling or blistering at the patch location. If this occurs, remove the patch, rinse the area and call the doctor immediately.<ref name="exelonpatch.com"/>

In a large clinical trial of the rivastigmine patch in 1,195 patients with Alzheimer's disease, the target dose of 9.5&nbsp;mg/24-hour patch provided similar clinical effects (e.g. memory and thinking, activities of daily living, concentration) as the highest doses of rivastigmine capsules, but with one-third fewer reports of nausea and vomiting.<ref name=Winblad>{{Cite journal | last1 = Winblad | first1 = B. | last2 = Grossberg | first2 = G. | last3 = Frölich | first3 = L. | last4 = Farlow | first4 = M. | last5 = Zechner | first5 = S. | last6 = Nagel | first6 = J. | last7 = Lane | first7 = R. | doi = 10.1212/01.wnl.0000281847.17519.e0 | title = IDEAL: A 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the first skin patch for Alzheimer disease | journal = Neurology | volume = 69 | issue = 4 Suppl 1 | pages = S14–S22 | year = 2007 | pmid =  17646619| pmc = }}</ref>

Usage of rivastigmine was associated with a higher frequency of reports of death as an adverse event in the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database compared to the other acetylcholinesterase inhibiting drugs donepezil and galantamine.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ali TB, Schleret TR, Reilly BM, Chen WY, Abagyan R |title=Adverse Effects of Cholinesterase Inhibitors in Dementia, According to the Pharmacovigilance Databases of the United-States and Canada |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=10 |issue=12 |pages=e0144337 |year=2015 |pmid=26642212 |pmc=4671709 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0144337 }}</ref>

==Administration==
Rivastigmine [[tartrate]] is a white to off-white, fine crystalline powder that is both lipophilic (soluble in fats) and hydrophilic (soluble in water). It comes in a variety of administrations including a capsule, solution and a [[transdermal patch]]. Like other [[Cholinesterase#Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors|cholinesterase inhibitors]], it requires doses to be increased gradually over several weeks; this is usually referred to as the titration phase.<ref name=Inglis>{{Cite journal

For oral dosing, an initial dose of 1.5&nbsp;mg twice daily is recommended followed by an increase by 1.5&nbsp;mg/dose after four weeks. The dose should increase as long as side effects are tolerable. Patients should be reminded to take with food. For the transdermal patch, an initial dose of 4.6&nbsp;mg per day increases to 9.5&nbsp;mg per day after four weeks if the patient is not experiencing any intolerable side effects.<ref name="pharma.us.novartis.com">https://www.pharma.us.novartis.com/product/pi/pdf/exelon.pdf{{full|date=January 2016}}</ref> Patients or caregivers should be reminded to remove the old patch every day, rotate sites and place a new one.

Rivastigmine is classified as [[pregnancy category]] B, with insufficient data on risks associated with breastfeeding. In cases of overdose, [[atropine]] is used to reverse [[bradycardia]].  [[Dialysis]] is ineffective due to the drug's half-life.

==Pharmacodynamics==
Rivastigmine, an [[acetylcholinesterase inhibitor]], inhibits both [[butyrylcholinesterase]] and [[acetylcholinesterase]] (unlike [[donepezil]], which selectively inhibits acetylcholinesterase). It is thought to work by inhibiting these cholinesterase enzymes, which would otherwise break down the brain [[neurotransmitter]] acetylcholine.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Camps | first1 = P.

==Pharmacokinetics==

When given orally, rivastigmine is well absorbed, with a bioavailability of about 40% in the 3-mg dose.  Pharmacokinetics are linear up to 3&nbsp;mg [[List of medical abbreviations: B|BID]], but nonlinear at higher doses.  Elimination is through the urine.  Peak plasma concentrations are seen in about one hour, with peak cerebrospinal fluid concentrations at 1.4–3.8 hours.   When given by once-daily transdermal patch, the pharmacokinetic profile of rivastigmine is much smoother, compared with capsules, with lower peak plasma concentrations and reduced fluctuations.<ref name= Cummings>{{Cite journal | last1 = Cummings | first1 = J. | last2 = Lefevre | first2 = G. | last3 = Small | first3 = G. | last4 = Appel-Dingemanse | first4 = S. | title = Pharmacokinetic rationale for the rivastigmine patch | doi = 10.1212/01.wnl.0000281846.40390.50 | journal = Neurology | volume = 69 | issue = 4 Suppl 1 | pages = S10–3 | year = 2007 | pmid =  17646618| pmc = }}</ref> The 9.5&nbsp;mg/24 h rivastigmine patch provides comparable exposure to 12&nbsp;mg/day capsules (the highest recommended oral dose).<ref name=Cummings />
