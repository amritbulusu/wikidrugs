'''Rufinamide''' is an [[anticonvulsant]] medication.  It is used in combination with other medication and therapy to treat [[Lennox–Gastaut syndrome]]<ref name="pmid17696794">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hakimian S, Cheng-Hakimian A, Anderson GD, Miller JW |title=Rufinamide: a new anti-epileptic medication |journal=Expert Opin Pharmacother |volume=8 |issue=12 |pages=1931–40 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17696794 |doi=10.1517/14656566.8.12.1931 |url=http://www.expertopin.com/doi/abs/10.1517/14656566.8.12.1931}}</ref> and various other [[seizure disorder]]s. Rufinamide, a [[triazole]] derivative, was developed in 2004 by [[Novartis|Novartis Pharma, AG]], and is manufactured by [[Eisai Co.|Eisai]].

Rufinamide was approved by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] on November 14, 2008 as adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome
in children 4 years and older and adults. Its official FDA-approved labeling does not mention use in the treatment of partial seizures inasmuch as clinical trials submitted to the FDA were marginal. However, several recent clinical trials suggest that the drug has efficacy for partial seizures <ref name="pmid19490053">{{cite journal|vauthors=Brodie MJ, Rosenfeld WE, Vazquez B, Sachdeo R, Perdomo C, Mann A, Arroyo S |title=Rufinamide for the adjunctive treatment of partial seizures in adults and adolescents: a randomized placebo-controlled trial|journal= Epilepsia|date=August 2009|volume=50|pages=1899–909|pmid=19490053|issue=8|doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2009.02160.x}}</ref> It is marketed under the brand name '''Banzel'''.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/2008/ucm116980.htm FDA press release - FDA Approves New Drug to Treat Severe Form of Epilepsy]</ref>  It is also marketed in the European Union under the brand name '''Inovelon'''.<ref>[http://www.emea.europa.eu/humandocs/Humans/EPAR/inovelon/inovelon.htm European Public Assessment Report for rufinamide (INOVELON)]</ref>

The [[mechanism of action]] of rufinamide is unknown. There is some evidence that rufinamide can modulate the gating of [[voltage-gated sodium channels]],<ref>{{Cite journal
