'''Colistin''', also known as '''polymyxin E''', is an [[antibiotic]] produced by certain strains of the bacteria ''[[Paenibacillus polymyxa]]''. Colistin is a mixture of the [[cyclic polypeptide]]s colistin A and B and belongs to the class of [[polypeptide antibiotic]]s known as [[polymyxin]]s. Colistin is effective against most [[Gram-negative]] bacilli.

Colistin is a decades-old drug that fell out of favor in human medicine due to its [[nephrotoxicity|kidney toxicity]]. It remains one of the [[Drug of last resort|last-resort antibiotics]] for multidrug-resistant ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'', ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'', and ''[[Acinetobacter]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Falagas ME, Grammatikos AP, Michalopoulos A | title = Potential of old-generation antibiotics to address current need for new antibiotics | journal = Expert review of anti-infective therapy | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 593–600 | date = October 2008 | doi = 10.1586/14787210.6.5.593 | pmid = 18847400 }}</ref> [[NDM-1]] metallo-β-lactamase multidrug-resistant [[Enterobacteriaceae]] have also shown susceptibility to colistin.<ref name=Kumarasamy>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kumarasamy KK, Toleman MA, Walsh TR, Bagaria J, Butt F, Balakrishnan R, Chaudhary U, Doumith M, Giske CG, Irfan S, Krishnan P, Kumar AV, Maharjan S, Mushtaq S, Noorie T, Paterson DL, Pearson A, Perry C, Pike R, Rao B, Ray U, Sarma JB, Sharma M, Sheridan E, Thirunarayan MA, Turton J, Upadhyay S, Warner M, Welfare W, Livermore DM, Woodford N | title = Emergence of a new antibiotic resistance mechanism in India, Pakistan, and the UK: a molecular, biological, and epidemiological study | journal = The Lancet Infectious Diseases | volume = 10 | issue = 9 | pages = 597–602 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20705517 | pmc = 2933358 | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(10)70143-2 }}</ref>

Resistance to colistin in humans is rare. The first colistin-resistance gene in a [[plasmid]] which can be transferred between bacterial strains was found in 2011 in China and became publicly known in November 2015. The presence of this  plasmid-borne ''[[MCR-1|mcr-1]]'' gene was confirmed starting December 2015 in SE-Asia, several European countries and the United States.

== History ==
Colistin was first isolated in Japan in 1949 from a flask of fermenting ''Bacillus'' ''polymyxa'' var. ''colistinus'' by the Japanese scientist Koyama<ref>{{cite journal | authors = Y Koyama, A Kurosasa, A Tsuchiya, K Takakuta | title = A new antibiotic 'colistin' produced by spore-forming soil bacteria | journal = J Antibiot (Tokyo) | volume = 3 | year = 1950 }}</ref> and became available for clinical use in 1959.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/colistin-an-overview|title=Colistin: An overview|website=www.uptodate.com|access-date=2016-06-06}}</ref>

Colistimethate sodium, a less toxic prodrug, became available for injection in 1959. In the 1980s, polymyxin use was widely discontinued because of nephro- and neurotoxicity. As multi-drug resistant bacteria became more prevalent in the 1990s, colistin started to get a second look as an emergency solution, in spite of toxic effects.<ref>{{cite journal | authors = Falagas M, Kasiakou S | title = Colistin: The Revival of Polymyxins for the Management of Multidrug-Resistant Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections | journal = Rev Anti Infect Agen | volume = 40 | year = 2005 }}</ref>

== Administration and dosage ==

=== Forms ===
Two forms of colistin are available commercially: '''colistin sulfate''' and '''colistimethate sodium''' (colistin methanesulfonate sodium, colistin sulfomethate sodium).  Colistin sulfate is [[cationic]]; colistimethate sodium is [[anionic]]. Colistin sulfate is stable, but colistimethate sodium is readily hydrolysed to a variety of methanesulfonated derivatives.  Colistin sulfate and colistimethate sodium are eliminated from the body by different routes.  With respect to ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'', colistimethate is the inactive prodrug of colistin. The two drugs are not interchangeable .

* Colistimethate sodium may be used to treat ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' infections in [[cystic fibrosis]] patients, and it has come into recent use for treating multidrug-resistant ''[[Acinetobacter]]'' infection, although resistant forms have been reported.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Reis AO, Luz DA, Tognim MC, Sader HS, Gales AC | title = Polymyxin-Resistant Acinetobacter spp. Isolates: What Is Next? | journal = Emerg Infect Dis | volume = 9 | pages = 1025–7 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12971377 | doi = 10.3201/eid0908.030052 | pmc=3020604}}</ref><ref name=Towner>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/hsp/abs/absacineto.html|author=Towner K J|year=2008|chapter=Molecular Basis of Antibiotic Resistance in Acinetobacter spp.|title=Acinetobacter Molecular Biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|id=http://www.horizonpress.com/acineto |isbn=0-306-43902-6}}</ref> Colistimethate sodium has also been given intrathecally and intraventricularly in ''Acinetobacter baumannii'' and ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' meningitis/[[ventriculitis]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Benifla M, Zucker G, Cohen A, Alkan M | title = Successful treatment of Acinetobacter meningitis with intrathecal polymyxin | journal = J Antimicrobial Chemotherapy | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | pages = 290–3 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15190037 | doi = 10.1093/jac/dkh289 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yagmur R, Esen F | title = Intrathecal colistin for treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ventriculitis: report of a case with successful outcome | journal = Critical Care | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 428 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17214907 | pmc = 1794456 | doi = 10.1186/cc5088 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Motaouakkil S, Charra B, Hachimi A, Nejmi H, Benslama A, Elmdaghri N, Belabbes H, Benbachir M | title = Colistin and rifampicin in the treatment of nosocomial infections from multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii | journal = Journal of Infection | volume = 53 | issue = 4 | pages = 274–8 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16442632 | doi = 10.1016/j.jinf.2005.11.019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Karakitsos D, Paramythiotou E, Samonis G, Karabinis A | title = Is intraventricular colistin an effective and safe treatment for post-surgical ventriculitis in the intensive care unit? | journal = Acta Anaesthesiol Scand. | volume = 50 | issue = 10 | pages = 1309–10 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17067336 | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-6576.2006.01126.x }}</ref> Some studies have indicated that colistin may be useful for treating infections caused by carbapenem-resistant isolates of ''[[Acinetobacter baumannii]]''.<ref name="Towner"/>
* Colistin sulfate may be used to treat intestinal infections, or to suppress [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]]ic flora.  Colistin sulfate is also used as topical creams, powders, and otic solutions.
* Colistin A (polymyxin E1) and colistin B (polymyxin E2) can be purified individually to research and study their effects and potencies as separate compounds.

=== Dosage ===
Colistin sulfate and colistimethate sodium may both be given intravenously, but the dosing is complicated.  The very different labeling of the parenteral products of colistin methanesulfonate in different parts of the world was first revealed by Li et al.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Li J, Nation RL, Turnidge JD, Milne RW, Coulthard K, Rayner CR, Paterson DL | title = Colistin: the re-emerging antibiotic for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections | journal = Lancet Infect Dis | volume = 6 | issue = 9 | pages = 589–601 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16931410 | doi = 10.1016/s1473-3099(06)70580-1 }}</ref> Colistimethate sodium manufactured by [[Xellia]] ('''Colomycin injection''') is prescribed in international units, but colistimethate sodium manufactured by [[Parkdale Pharmaceuticals]] ('''Coly-Mycin M Parenteral''') is prescribed in milligrams of colistin base:
* Colomycin 1,000,000 units is 80&nbsp;mg colistimethate;<ref name=emc1590/>
* Coly-mycin M 150&nbsp;mg "colistin base" is 360&nbsp;mg colistimethate or 4,500,000 units.<ref>http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/vet/mrls/081502en.pdf; NB. Colistin base has an assigned potency of 30 000 IU/mg</ref>

Because colistin was introduced into clinical practice over 50 years ago, it was never subject to the regulations that modern drugs are subject to, and therefore there is no standardised dosing of colistin and no detailed trials on pharmacology or pharmacokinetics:  The optimal dosing of colistin for most infections is therefore unknown.  Colomycin has a recommended intravenous dose of 1 to 2 million units three times daily for patients weighing 60&nbsp;kg or more with normal renal function. Coly-Mycin has a recommended dose of 2.5 to 5&nbsp;mg/kg colistin base a day, which is equivalent to 6 to 12&nbsp;mg/kg colistimethate sodium per day.  For a 60&nbsp;kg man, therefore, the recommended dose for Colomycin is 240 to 480&nbsp;mg of colistimethate sodium, yet the recommended dose for Coly-Mycin is 360 to 720&nbsp;mg of colistimethate sodium.  Likewise, the recommended "maximum" dose for each preparation is different (480&nbsp;mg for Colomycin and 720&nbsp;mg for Coly-Mycin).  Each country has different generic preparations of colistin, and the recommended dose  depends on the manufacturer.  This complete absence of any regulation or standardisation of dose makes intravenous colistin dosing difficult for any physician. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Colistin has been used in combination with [[rifampicin]], and  evidence of ''in-vitro'' synergy exists,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ahmed N, Wahlgren NG | title = In vitro interaction of colistin and rifampin on multidrug-resistant ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' | journal = J Chemother | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 235–8 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12686786 | doi = 10.1159/000069498 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors=Hogg GM, Barr JG, Webb CH | title=In-vitro activity of the combination of colistin and rifampicin against multidrug-resistant strains of ''Acinetobacter baumannii'' | journal=J Antimicrob Chemother | year=1998 | volume=41 | pages=494–5  | doi=10.1093/jac/41.4.494 | issue=4 |pmid=9598783}}</ref> and the combination has been used successfully in patients.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Petrosillo N, Chinello P, Proietti MF, Cecchini L, Masala M, Franchi C, Venditti M, Esposito S, Nicastri E | title = Combined colistin and rifampicin therapy for carbapenem-resistant ''Acinetobacter baumannii'' infections: clinical outcome and adverse events | journal = Clin Microbiol Infect | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 682–3 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16008625 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-0691.2005.01198.x }}</ref> There is also in-vitro evidence of synergy for colistimethate sodium used in combination with other antipseudomonal antibiotics.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors=MacGowan AP, Rynn C, Wootton M, Bowker KE, Holt HA, Reeves DS | title=In vitro assessment of colistin's antipseudomonal antimicrobial interactions with other antibiotics | journal=Clin Microbiol Infect. | year=1999 | volume=5 |issue=1 | pages=32–36 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-0691.1999.tb00095.x |pmid=11856210 |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1198-743X(14)64906-5}}</ref>

Colistimethate sodium aerosol (Promixin; Colomycin Injection) is used to treat pulmonary infections, especially in cystic fibrosis.

== Mechanism of action ==
Colistin is a [[cationic|polycationic]] peptide and has both [[hydrophilic]] and [[lipophilic]] [[Functional group|moieties]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} These cationic regions interact with the [[bacterial outer membrane]], by displacing magnesium and calcium bacterial counter ions in the [[lipopolysaccharide]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Hydrophobic/hydrophilic regions interact with the [[cytoplasmic membrane]] just like a detergent, solubilizing the membrane in an aqueous environment.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} This effect is bactericidal even in an isosmolar environment.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

== Antibacterial spectrum==
Colistin has been effective in treating infections caused by ''Pseudomonas, Escherichia'', and ''Klebsiella'' species. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant microorganisms:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://antibiotics.toku-e.com/antimicrobial_958_2.html|title=Polymyxin E (Colistin) - The Antimicrobial Index Knowledgebase - TOKU-E|publisher=|accessdate=28 May 2016}}</ref><ref>http://www.toku-e.com/Assets/MIC/Colistin%20sulfate%20USP.pdf</ref>

* ''Klebsiella pneumoniae'': 0.25–128 μg/ml
* ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'': ≤0.06–16 μg/ml

For example, colistin in combination with other drugs are used to attack ''P. aeruginosa'' biofilm infection in lungs of CF patients.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Herrmann G, Yang L, Wu H, Song Z, Wang H, Høiby N, Ulrich M, Molin S, Riethmüller J, Döring G |title=Colistin-tobramycin combinations are superior to monotherapy concerning the killing of biofilm ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' |journal=J.

== Resistance ==
Resistance to colistin is rare, but has been described.  {{As of |2017}}, no agreement exists about how to look for colistin resistance.  The [[:fr:Société Française de Microbiologie]] uses a cut-off of 2&nbsp;mg/l, whereas the [[British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy]] sets a cutoff of 4&nbsp;mg/l or less as sensitive, and 8&nbsp;mg/ml or more as resistant.  No standards for measuring colistin sensitivity are given in the US.

== Pharmacokinetics ==
No clinically useful absorption of colistin occurs in the gastrointestinal tract.  For systemic infection, colistin must, therefore, be given by injection.
Colistimethate is eliminated by the kidneys, but colistin is supposed to be eliminated by non-renal mechanism(s) that are as yet not characterised.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Li J, Milne RW, Nation RL, Turnidge JD, Smeaton TC, Coulthard K | title = Pharmacokinetics of colistin methanesulphonate and colistin in rats following an intravenous dose of colistin methanesulphonate | journal = J Antimicrob Chemother. | volume = 53 | issue = 5 | pages = 837–40 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15044428 | doi = 10.1093/jac/dkh167 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Li J, Milne RW, Nation RL, Turnidge JD, Smeaton TC, Coulthard K | title = Use of High-Performance Liquid Chromatography To Study the Pharmacokinetics of Colistin Sulfate in Rats following Intravenous Administration | journal = Antimicrob Agents Chemother | volume = 47 | issue = 5 | pages = 1766–70 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12709357 | pmc = 153303 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.47.5.1766-1770.2003 }}</ref>

==Biosynthesis==
The biosynthesis of colistin requires the use of three amino acids [[threonine]], [[valine]], and 2,4-diaminobutryic acid. It is important to synthesis the linear form of colistin before cycliziation. Elongation of non ribosomal peptide biosynthesis begins by a loading module and then the addition of each subsequent amino acid. The subsequent amino acids are added with the help of an [[adenylation]] domain (A), a peptidyl carrier protein domain (PCP), an [[epimerization]] domain (E), and a [[condensation domain]] (C). Cyclization is accomplished by utilizing a [[thioesterase]]<ref>Dewick, Paul M, Medicinal Natural Products, Third Edition, John Wiley & Sons, 2009</ref>. The first step is to have a loading domain, 6-methyl-heptanoic acid, associate with the A and PCP domains. Now with a C, A, and PCP domain that is associated with 2,4-diaminobutryic acid. This continues with each amino acid until the linear peptide chain is completed. The last module will have a thioesterase to complete the cyclization and form the product colistin. [[File:Wiki biosyntheiss colistin.png|thumb|center|upright=3.0|The salmon color refers to the loading domain 6-methyl-hepatonic acid, yellow is 2,4-diaminobutryic acid, light blue is threonine, and purple is valine]]
