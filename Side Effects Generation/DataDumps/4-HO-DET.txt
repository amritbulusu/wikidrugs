==History==
4-HO-DET received the lab code CZ-74 in the late 1950s by the inventors of the substance, [[Albert Hofmann]] and [[Franz Troxler]]. The substance was used together with its phosphoryloxy-analog ethocybin in human clinical trials in the 1960s by the German researchers [[Hanscarl Leuner]] and G. Baer.{{cn|date=June 2017}}
