Crenolanib is an orally bioavailable benzamidazole that selectively and potently inhibits signaling of [[wild-type]] and mutant isoforms of class III receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) [[FLT3]] (FMS-like Tyrosine Kinase 3), [[PDGFR]] α (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor), and PDGFR β.  Unlike most RTK inhibitors, crenolanib is a type I mutant-specific inhibitor that preferentially binds to [[phosphorylated]] active kinases with the ‘DFG in’ conformation [[Structural motif|motif]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gistsupport.org/media/GISTS_2012/POSTER--AROG--AACR%202012_type%20I%20vs%20type%20II%20poster.pdf |title=CRENOLANIB, A NOVEL TYPE I, MUTANT -SPECIFIC INHIBITOR OF CLASS III RECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASES, PREFERENTIALLY BINDS TO PHOSPHORYLATED KINASES |author1=A.

== Mechanism ==

===[[FLT3]]: wild-type and mutant===
Crenolanib inhibits both wild type [[FLT3]] and its constitutively active mutations.  In vitro studies have shown that crenolanib has low [[Dissociation constant|''K''<sub>d</sub>]] for the [[FLT3]] enzyme with constitutively activating internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations and [[tyrosine kinase]] domain (TKD) mutations, D835H and D835Y, as compared to wild type. Crenolanib tightly binds to [[FLT3]]-ITD, [[FLT3]]-D835H and [[FLT3]]-D835Y with [[Dissociation constant|''K''<sub>d</sub>]] of 0.74 nM, 0.4 nM, and 0.18 nM, respectively.<ref name="Ref7">{{cite journal |doi=10.1158/1538-7445.AM2012-3683 |title=Abstract 3683: Crenolanib, a novel Type I, mutant-specific inhibitor of Class III receptor tyrosine kinases, preferentially binds to phosphorylated kinases |year=2012 |last1=Muralidhara |first1=C. |last2=Ramachandran |first2=A. |last3=Jain |first3=V.

===PDGFRα: wild-type and mutant===
Crenolanib has been shown to inhibit [[PDGFRα]] with an [[IC50]] of 0.4&nbsp;ng/mL in porcine aortic epithelial cell lines.   In [[Chinese hamster ovary|Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)]] cells expressing [[PDGFRα]], crenolanib inhibited the phosphorylation of wild type [[PDGFRα]] at an [[IC50]] of 10 nM.<ref name="Ref9">{{cite journal |doi=10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-0625 |title=Crenolanib Inhibits the Drug-Resistant [[PDGFRA]] D842V Mutation Associated with Imatinib-Resistant Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors |year=2012 |last1=Heinrich |first1=M.

===PDGFRβ: wild-type===
Crenolanib has been shown to inhibit [[PDGFRβ]] with an [[IC50]] of 0.8&nbsp;ng/mL in porcine aortic epithelial cell lines.  Crenolanib inhibits the ability of recombinant [[PDGFRβ]] to phosphorylate a synthetic tyrosine substrate ([[poly-glutamic acid]]-tyrosine), with an [[IC50]] of 0.4&nbsp;ng/mL. Evaluation of the antitumor activity of crenolanib in a genetically engineered BSG DIPG mouse model showed that it is highly selective for [[PDGFRβ]] with an [[IC50]] of 10 nM when measured by BrdU assay and 1.25 uM by [[MTT assay]].

===C-Kit: wild-type and mutant===
Crenolanib has been shown to have [[IC50]] and Kd values of 67 nM and 78 nM, respectively, for wild type [[c-KIT]] in in vitro assays{{citation needed|reason=This claim doesn't have a citation. Reference 14 does NOT have actual Kd... it just says "still being determined"|date=September 2014}}.  Similar assays show that crenolanib inhibits [[c-KIT]] activating mutations D816H and D816V with [[IC50]] concentrations of 5.4 and 2.5 nM, respectively.<ref name="Ref7" />{{citation needed|reason=This claim doesn't have a citation. Reference 14 does NOT have actual Kd... it just says "still being determined"|date=September 2014}}  Human [[bone marrow]] [[progenitor cell]] growth assays showed that crenolanib has modest effects on [[GM-CSF]] and [[BFUE]] driven colony formation at the [[IC50]] concentration of 20 nM.<ref name="Ref8" />
