'''Tricyclic antidepressants''' ('''TCAs''') are a class of medications that are used primarily as [[antidepressant]]s. TCAs were first discovered in the early 1950s and were marketed later in the decade.<ref>Carson VB (2000). [https://books.google.com/books?id=QM5rAAAAMAAJ Mental health nursing: the nurse-patient journey] W.B. Saunders. {{ISBN|978-0-7216-8053-8}}. pp. 423</ref> They are named after their [[chemical structure]], which contains three [[cyclic compound|rings of atoms]]. [[Tetracyclic antidepressant]]s (TeCAs), which contain four rings of atoms, are a closely related group of antidepressant compounds.

Although TCAs are sometimes [[medical prescription|prescribed]] for depressive disorders, they have been largely replaced in clinical use in most parts of the world by newer antidepressants such as [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs), [[serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s (SNRIs) and [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s (NRIs). Adverse effects have been found to be of a similar level between TCAs and SSRIs.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Trindade |first1=E. |last2=Menon |first2=D. |last3=Topfer |first3=L.

==Medical uses==
The TCAs are used primarily in the [[therapy|clinical treatment]] of [[mood disorder]]s such as [[major depressive disorder]] (MDD), [[dysthymia]], and [[treatment-resistant depression|treatment-resistant]] variants. They are also used in the treatment of a number of other [[disorder (medicine)|medical disorders]], including [[anxiety disorders]] such as [[generalized anxiety disorder]] (GAD), social phobia (SP) also known as [[social anxiety disorder]] (SAD), [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD), and [[panic disorder]] (PD), [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), [[body dysmorphic disorder]] (BDD), [[eating disorder]]s like [[anorexia nervosa]] and [[bulimia nervosa]], certain [[personality disorder]]s such as [[borderline personality disorder]] (BPD), [[Neurological disorders]] such as [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=41885&page=2|title=Nonstimulant Therapy (Strattera) and Other ADHD Drugs - MedicineNet|work=MedicineNet}}</ref> [[Parkinson's disease]]<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=22555881|year=2012|author1=Paumier|first1=K.

===Clinical depression===
For many years the TCAs were the first choice for [[pharmacological]] [[therapy|treatment]] of [[clinical depression]]. Although they are still considered to be highly [[efficacy#Healthcare|effective]], they have been increasingly replaced by antidepressants with an improved safety and side effect profile, such as the SSRIs and other newer antidepressants such as the novel reversible MAOI [[moclobemide]]. However, tricyclic antidepressants are possibly more effective in treating [[melancholic depression]] than other antidepressant drug classes.<ref name="pmid7980178">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mitchell PB, Mitchell MS |title=The management of depression. Part 2. The place of the new antidepressants |journal=Aust Fam Physician |volume=23 |issue=9 |pages=1771–3, 1776–81 |date=September 1994|pmid=7980178 }}</ref> Newer antidepressants are thought to have fewer and less severe [[adverse effect|side effects]] and are also thought to be less likely to result in injury or death if used in a [[suicide attempt]], as the doses required for clinical treatment and potentially [[Lethal dose|lethal]] [[overdose]] (see [[therapeutic index]]) are far wider in comparison.

Nonetheless, the TCAs are still occasionally used for [[treatment-resistant depression]] that has failed to respond to therapy with newer antidepressants.<ref name="pmid10498158">{{cite journal | author = Broquet K | title = Status of treatment of depression | journal = South Med J | volume = 92 | issue = 9 | pages = 846–56 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10498158 | doi = 10.1097/00007611-199909000-00001 }}</ref> They are not considered [[drug addiction|addictive]] and are somewhat preferable to the [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAOIs). The side effects of the TCAs usually come to prominence before the [[therapeutic effect|therapeutic benefits]] against depression and/or anxiety do, and for this reason, they may potentially be somewhat dangerous, as [[volition (psychology)|volition]] can be increased, possibly giving the [[patient]] a greater desire to attempt or commit [[suicide]].<ref name="pmid8452661">{{cite journal |vauthors=Teicher M, Glod C, Cole J | title = Antidepressant drugs and the emergence of suicidal tendencies | journal = Drug Saf | volume = 8|issue = 3 | pages = 186–212 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8452661 | doi = 10.2165/00002018-199308030-00002 }}</ref>

===Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder===
The TCAs were used in the past in the clinical treatment of ADHD,<ref name="pmid2676967">{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00004583-198909000-00022 |authors=Biederman J, Baldessarini R, Wright V, Knee D, Harmatz J |title=A double-blind placebo controlled study of desipramine in the treatment of ADD: I.

ADHD is thought to be caused by an insufficiency of [[dopamine]] and [[norepinephrine]] [[brain activity|activity]] in the [[prefrontal cortex]] of the [[Human brain|brain]].<ref name="pmid19183781">{{cite journal |authors=Blum K, Chen AL, Braverman ER, Comings DE, Chen TJ, Arcuri V, Blum SH, Downs BW, Waite RL, Notaro A, Lubar J, Williams L, Prihoda TJ, Palomo T, Oscar-Berman M. |date=2008 |title=Attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder and reward deficiency syndrome |journal=Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat. |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=894–913 |doi=10.2147/NDT.S2627 |pmc=2626918 |pmid=19183781}}</ref> Most of the TCAs [[reuptake inhibitor|inhibit]] the [[reuptake]] of norepinephrine, though not dopamine, and as a result, they show some efficacy in remedying the disorder.<ref name="pmid10560028">{{cite journal |authors=Biederman J, Spencer T |title=Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as a noradrenergic disorder |journal=Biol Psychiatry |volume=46 |issue=9 |pages=1234–42 |year=1999 |pmid=10560028 |doi=10.1016/S0006-3223(99)00192-4}}</ref> Notably, the TCAs are more effective in treating the [[behavioral]] aspects of ADHD than the [[cognitive deficit]]s, as they help limit [[hyperactivity]] and [[impulsivity]], but have little to no benefits on [[attention]].<ref name="pmid9418743">{{cite journal |author=Popper C |title=Antidepressants in the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=58 |issue=Suppl 14 |pages=14–29; discussion 30–1 |year=1997 |pmid=9418743}}</ref>

===Chronic pain===
The TCAs show efficacy in the clinical treatment of a number of different types of [[chronic pain]], notably neuralgia or [[neuropathic pain]] and [[fibromyalgia]].<ref name="pmid16762426">{{cite journal |vauthors=Micó J, Ardid D, Berrocoso E, Eschalier A | title = Antidepressants and pain | journal = Trends Pharmacol Sci | volume = 27 | issue = 7 | pages = 348–54 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16762426 |doi = 10.1016/j.tips.2006.05.004}}</ref><ref name="pmid9121808">{{cite journal |vauthors=McQuay H, Tramèr M, Nye B, Carroll D, Wiffen P, Moore R | title = A systematic review of antidepressants in neuropathic pain | journal = Pain | volume = 68 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 217–27 | year = 1996 | pmid = 9121808 | doi = 10.1016/S0304-3959(96)03140-5}}</ref> The precise [[mechanism of action]] in explanation of their analgesic efficacy is unclear, but it is thought that they indirectly modulate the [[opioid]] system in the brain downstream via [[serotonergic]] and [[noradrenergic]] [[Neuromodulation (biology)|neuromodulation]], among other properties.<ref name="pmid6219612">{{cite journal |vauthors=Botney M, Fields H | title = Amitriptyline potentiates morphine analgesia by a direct action on the central nervous system | journal = Ann Neurol | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 160–4 | year = 1983 | pmid = 6219612 | doi = 10.1002/ana.410130209}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Benbouzid M |title=Delta-opioid receptors are critical for tricyclic antidepressant treatment of neuropathic allodynia |journal=Biological Psychiatry |volume=63|issue=6|pages=633–6 |date=March 2008 |pmid=17693391 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2007.06.016|name-list-format=vanc|author2= Gavériaux-Ruff C |author3= Yalcin I |display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=de Gandarias JM, Echevarria E, Acebes I, Silio M, Casis L |title=Effects of imipramine administration on mu-opioid receptor immunostaining in the rat forebrain |journal=Arzneimittel-Forschung |volume=48 |issue=7 |pages=717–9 |date=July 1998 |pmid=9706370}}</ref> They are also effective in [[migraine]] [[prophylaxis]], though not in the instant relief of an acute migraine attack. They may also be effective to prevent chronic tension headaches.

==Side effects==
Many [[adverse effect|side effects]] may be related to the [[antimuscarinic]] properties of the TCAs. Such side effects are relatively common and may include dry mouth, dry nose, blurry vision, lowered gastrointestinal motility or constipation, urinary retention, cognitive and/or memory impairment, and increased body temperature.

Other side effects may include drowsiness, anxiety, emotional blunting (apathy/[[anhedonia]]), confusion, restlessness, dizziness, [[akathisia]], [[hypersensitivity]], changes in appetite and weight, sweating, [[sexual dysfunction]], muscle twitches, weakness, nausea and vomiting, [[hypotension]], [[tachycardia]], and rarely, [[arrythmia|irregular heart rhythms]]. Twitching, hallucinations, delirium and coma are also some of the toxic effects caused by overdose.<ref>Gelder, M, Mayou, R. and Geddes, J. 2005. Psychiatry. 3rd ed. New York: Oxford. pp243.</ref> Rhabdomyolysis or muscle breakdown has been rarely reported with this class of drugs as well.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chabria SB |title=Rhabdomyolysis: a manifestation of cyclobenzaprine toxicity |journal=J Occup Med Toxicol|volume=1|issue= |pages=16 |year=2006 |pmid=16846511 |pmc=1540431 |doi=10.1186/1745-6673-1-16 |url=}}</ref>

Tolerance to these adverse effects of these drugs often develops if treatment is continued. Side effects may also be less troublesome if treatment is initiated with low doses and then gradually increased, although this may also delay the beneficial effects.

TCAs can behave like class [[Antiarrhythmic agent|1A antiarrhythmics]], as such, they can theoretically terminate ventricular fibrillation, decrease cardiac contractility and increase collateral blood circulation to ischemic heart muscle. Naturally, in overdose, they can be cardiotoxic, prolonging heart rhythms and increasing myocardial irritability.

New research has also revealed compelling evidence of a link between long-term use of anticholinergic medications like TCAs and [[dementia]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gray|first1=Shelly L.|last2=Anderson|first2=Melissa L.|last3=Dublin|first3=Sascha|last4=Hanlon|first4=Joseph T.|last5=Hubbard|first5=Rebecca|last6=Walker|first6=Rod|last7=Yu|first7=Onchee|last8=Crane|first8=Paul K.|last9=Larson|first9=Eric B.|title=Cumulative Use of Strong Anticholinergics and Incident Dementia|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|date=1 March 2015|volume=175|issue=3|pages=401–7|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2014.7663|pmid=25621434|pmc=4358759}}</ref> Although many studies have investigated this link, this was the first study to use a long-term approach (over seven years) to find that dementias associated with anticholinergics may not be reversible even years after drug use stops.<ref>{{cite web|title=Strong Link Found Between Dementia, Common Anticholinergic Drugs|url=http://www.dddmag.com/articles/2015/04/strong-link-found-between-dementia-common-anticholinergic-drugs|website=Drug Discovery & Development}}</ref> Anticholinergic drugs block the action of [[acetylcholine]], which transmits messages in the nervous system. In the brain, acetylcholine is involved in learning and memory.

===Discontinuation===
Antidepressants in general may produce a withdrawal. However, since the term "withdrawal" has been linked to addiction to recreational drugs like opioids, the medical profession and pharmaceutical public relations prefer that a different term be used, hence "discontinuation syndrome."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shelton RC |title=The nature of the discontinuation syndrome associated with antidepressant drugs |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=67 Suppl 4 |issue= |pages=3–7 |year=2006 |pmid=16683856 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Discontinuation symptoms can be managed by a gradual reduction in dosage over a period of weeks or months to minimise symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=van Broekhoven F, Kan CC, Zitman FG |title=Dependence potential of antidepressants compared to benzodiazepines|journal=Progress in Neuro-psychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=939–43 |date=June 2002|pmid=12369270 |doi=10.1016/S0278-5846(02)00209-9}}</ref>
In tricyclics, discontinuation syndrome symptoms include anxiety, insomnia, headache, nausea, malaise, or motor disturbance.<ref>{{cite web |author=Kent Kunze MD |title=Somatic Therapies in Psychiatry |url= https://angel.dmu.edu/section/default.asp?id=0921%5FPSYC%5F2107%5F01 |publisher= Des Moines University Psychiatry Class}}</ref>

==Overdose==
{{Main|Tricyclic antidepressant overdose}}

TCA overdose is a significant cause of fatal drug [[poison]]ing. The severe [[morbidity]] and mortality associated with these drugs is well documented due to their [[circulatory system|cardiovascular]] and [[neurology|neurological]] toxicity. Additionally, it is a serious problem in the pediatric population due to their inherent toxicity<ref name="JEmergMed2005-Rosenbaum">{{cite journal |vauthors=Rosenbaum T, Kou M |title=Are one or two dangerous? Tricyclic antidepressant exposure in toddlers |journal=J Emerg Med |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=169–74 |year=2005 |pmid=15707813 |doi=10.1016/j.jemermed.2004.08.018}}</ref> and the availability of these in the home when prescribed for bed-wetting and depression. In the event of a known or suspected overdose, medical assistance should be sought immediately.

A number of treatments are effective in a TCA overdose.

An overdose on TCA is especially fatal as it is rapidly absorbed from the GI tract in the alkaline conditions of the small intestines. As a result, toxicity often becomes apparent in the first hour after an overdose. However, symptoms may take several hours to appear if a mixed overdose has caused delayed gastric emptying.

Many of the initial signs are those associated to the anticholinergic effects of TCAs such as dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention, constipation, dizziness, and emesis (or vomiting). Due to the location of norepinephrine receptors all over the body, many physical signs are also associated with a TCA overdose:<ref>California Poison Control 1-800-876-4766</ref>

# Anticholinergic effects: altered mental status (e.g., agitation, confusion, lethargy, etc.), resting sinus tachycardia, dry mouth, mydriasis (pupil dilation), fever
# Cardiac effects: hypertension (early and transient, should not be treated), tachycardia, orthostasis and hypotension, arrhythmias (including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, most serious consequence) / ECG changes (prolonged QRS, QT, and PR intervals)
# CNS effects: syncope, seizure, coma, myoclonus, hyperreflexia
# Pulmonary effects: hypoventilation resulting from CNS depression
# Gastrointestinal effects: decreased or absent bowel sounds

Treatment of TCA overdose depends on severity of symptoms:

Initially, gastric decontamination of the patient is achieved by administering, either orally or via a [[nasogastric tube]], [[Activated carbon|activated charcoal]] pre-mixed with water, which [[Adsorption|adsorbs]] the drug in the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]] (most useful if given within 2 hours of drug ingestion). Other decontamination methods such as stomach pumps, gastric lavage, whole bowel irrigation, or (ipecac induced) emesis, are ''not''&nbsp; recommended in TCA poisoning.

If there is metabolic acidosis, [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous infusion]] of [[sodium bicarbonate]] is recommended by Toxbase.org, the UK and Ireland poisons advice database (TCAs are protein bound and become less bound in more acidic conditions, so by reversing the acidosis, protein binding increases and bioavailability thus decreases – the sodium load may also help to reverse the Na+ channel blocking effects of the TCA).

==Interactions==
The TCAs are highly metabolised by the [[Cytochrome P450 oxidase|cytochrome P450]] hepatic enzymes. Drugs that inhibit [[Cytochrome P450 oxidase|cytochrome P450]] (for example [[cimetidine]], [[methylphenidate]], [[fluoxetine]], [[antipsychotic]]s, and [[calcium channel blocker]]s) may produce decreases in the TCAs' metabolism, leading to increases in their blood concentrations and accompanying toxicity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.preskorn.com/books/ssri_s7.html|title=Clinical Pharmacology of SSRI's: Why Are CYP Enzymes Important When Considering SSRIs?|work=preskorn.com}}</ref> Drugs that prolong the [[QT interval]] including antiarrhythmics such as [[quinidine]], the antihistamines [[astemizole]] and [[terfenadine]], and some [[antipsychotic]]s may increase the chance of ventricular dysrhythmias. TCAs may enhance the response to [[ethanol|alcohol]] and the effects of [[barbiturate]]s and other CNS depressants. Side effects may also be enhanced by other drugs that have antimuscarinic properties.

==Pharmacology==
The majority of the TCAs act primarily as SNRIs by blocking the [[serotonin transporter]] (SERT) and the [[norepinephrine transporter]] (NET), respectively, which results in an elevation of the [[Synapse|synaptic]] concentrations of these [[neurotransmitter]]s, and therefore an enhancement of [[neurotransmission]].<ref name="pmid9537821">{{cite journal |vauthors=Tatsumi M, Groshan K, Blakely RD, Richelson E | title = Pharmacological profile of antidepressants and related compounds at human monoamine transporters | journal = Eur J Pharmacol. | volume = 340 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 249–258 | year = 1997 |pmid = 9537821 | doi = 10.1016/S0014-2999(97)01393-9 }}</ref><ref name="pmid17471183">{{cite journal | author = Gillman PK | title = Tricyclic antidepressant pharmacology and therapeutic drug interactions updated | journal = [[British Journal of Pharmacology]] | volume = 151 | issue = 6 | pages = 737–48 |date=July 2007 | pmid = 17471183 | pmc = 2014120 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bjp.0707253 | url =}}</ref> Notably, with the sole exception of [[amineptine]], the TCAs have negligible [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for the [[dopamine transporter]] (DAT), and therefore have no efficacy as [[dopamine reuptake inhibitor]]s (DRIs).<ref name="pmid9537821" /> Both [[serotonin]] and [[norepinephrine]] have been highly implicated in [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]], and it has been shown that facilitation of their activity has beneficial effects on these [[mental disorder]]s.<ref name="pmid9551776">{{cite journal|vauthors=Rénéric JP, Lucki I |title=Antidepressant behavioral effects by dual inhibition of monoamine reuptake in the rat forced swimming test |journal=Psychopharmacology |volume=136|issue=2 |pages=190–7 |date=March 1998 |pmid=9551776 |doi=10.1007/s002130050555}}</ref>

==History==
The TCAs were developed amid the "explosive birth" of psychopharmacology in the early 1950s. The story begins with the synthesis of [[chlorpromazine]] in December 1950 by [[Rhône-Poulenc]]'s chief chemist, Paul Charpentier, from synthetic [[antihistamines]] developed by Rhône-Poulenc in the 1940s.<ref name="assets.cambridge.org">A Guide to the Extrapyramidal Side-Effects of Antipsychotic Drugs, D. G. Cunningham Owens, http://assets.cambridge.org/97805216/33536/excerpt/9780521633536_excerpt.pdf</ref> Its psychiatric effects were first noticed at a hospital in Paris in 1952. The first widely used psychiatric drug, by 1955 it was already generating significant revenue as an [[antipsychotic]].<ref name="Becoming Neurochemical Selves">{{cite book |last1=Rose |first1=Nikolas |chapter=Becoming Neurochemical Selves |editor-last=Stehr |editor-first=Nico |date=2004 |title=Biotechnology: Between Commerce and Civil Society |location=New Brunswick, NJ |publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=978-0-7658-0224-8 |pages=90–91<!--pp. 2–3 when standalone-->}}</ref> Research chemists quickly began to explore other derivatives of chlorpromazine.

The first TCA reported for the treatment of depression was [[imipramine]], a dibenzazepine analogue of chlorpromazine code-named G22355. It was not originally targeted for the treatment of depression. The drug's tendency to induce manic effects was "later described as 'in some patients, quite disastrous'". The paradoxical observation of a sedative inducing mania led to testing with depressed patients. The first trial of imipramine took place in 1955 and the first report of antidepressant effects was published by Swiss psychiatrist [[Roland Kuhn]] in 1957.<ref name="assets.cambridge.org" /> Some testing of Geigy’s imipramine, then known as Tofranil, took place at the Münsterlingen Hospital near Konstanz.<ref name="Becoming Neurochemical Selves" /> Geigy later became Ciba-Geigy and eventually [[Novartis]].

[[Dibenzazepine]] derivatives are described in U.S. patent 3,074,931 issued 1963-01-22 by assignment to [[GlaxoSmithKline|Smith Kline & French Laboratories]]. The compounds described share a tricyclic backbone different from the backbone of the TCA [[amitriptyline]].

[[Merck & Co.|Merck]] introduced the second member of the TCA family, amitriptyline (Elavil), in 1961.<ref name="Becoming Neurochemical Selves" /> This compound has a different three-ring structure than imipramine.

==List of TCAs==
Those that preferentially inhibit the reuptake of serotonin (by at least 10-fold over norepinephrine) include:

* [[Butriptyline]]† (Evadyne) (relatively weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor)
* '''[[Clomipramine]]''' (Anafranil)
* '''[[Imipramine]]''' (Tofranil, Janimine, Praminil)
* '''[[Trimipramine]]''' (Surmontil) (relatively weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor)

Those that preferentially inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine (by at least 10-fold over serotonin) include:

* [[Desipramine]] (Norpramin, Pertofrane)
* [[Dibenzepin]]‡ (Noveril, Victoril)
* '''[[Lofepramine]]'''§ (Lomont, Gamanil)
* '''[[Maprotiline]]''' (Ludiomil) – can be classed with the TCAs though more frequently classed with the TeCAs
* '''[[Nortriptyline]]''' (Pamelor, Aventyl, Norpress)
* [[Protriptyline]] (Vivactil)

Whereas either fairly balanced reuptake inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine or unspecified inhibitors include:

{{colbegin}}
* '''[[Amitriptyline]]''' (Elavil, Endep)
* [[Amitriptylinoxide]] (Amioxid, Ambivalon, Equilibrin)
* [[Amoxapine]] (Asendin) – can be classed with the TeCAs but more frequently classed with the TCAs
* [[Demexiptiline]]† (Deparon, Tinoran)
* [[Dimetacrine]]† (Istonil, Istonyl, Miroistonil)
* '''[[Dosulepin]]'''§ (Prothiaden)
* '''[[Doxepin]]''' (Adapin, Sinequan)
* [[Fluacizine]]† (Phtorazisin)
* [[Imipraminoxide]]† (Imiprex, Elepsin)
* [[Melitracen]]§ (Deanxit, Dixeran, Melixeran, Trausabun)
* [[Metapramine]]† (Timaxel)
* [[Nitroxazepine]]‡ (Sintamil)
* [[Noxiptiline]]‡ (Agedal, Elronon, Nogedal)
* [[Pipofezine]]‡ (Azafen/Azaphen)
* [[Propizepine]]† (Depressin, Vagran)
* [[Quinupramine]]† (Kevopril, Kinupril, Adeprim, Quinuprine)
{{colend}}

And the following are TCAs that act via main mechanisms other than serotonin or norepinephrine reuptake inhibition:

* [[Amineptine]]‡ (Survector, Maneon, Directim) – [[norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor]]
* [[Iprindole]]† (Prondol, Galatur, Tetran) – [[5-HT2 receptor|5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]]
* [[Opipramol]]‡ (Insidon, Pramolan, Ensidon, Oprimol) – [[sigma receptor|σ receptor]] [[receptor agonist|agonist]]
* [[Tianeptine]]‡ (Stablon, Coaxil, Tatinol) – atypical [[μ-opioid receptor]] agonist
