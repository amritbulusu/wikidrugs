== Physiological effects==
The [[adrenal medulla]] is a minor contributor to total circulating [[catecholamines]] ([[L-DOPA|<small>L</small>-DOPA]] is at a higher concentration in the [[Blood plasma|plasma]]),<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rizzo V, Memmi M, Moratti R, Melzi d'Eril G, Perucca E | title = Concentrations of L-dopa in plasma and plasma ultrafiltrates | journal = Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis | volume = 14 | issue = 8–10 | pages = 1043–6 | date = June 1996 | pmid = 8818013 | doi = 10.1016/s0731-7085(96)01753-0 }}</ref> though it contributes over 90% of circulating epinephrine. Little epinephrine is found in other tissues, mostly in scattered [[chromaffin cells]]. Following [[adrenalectomy]], epinephrine disappears below the detection limit in the blood stream.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cryer PE | title = Physiology and pathophysiology of the human sympathoadrenal neuroendocrine system | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 303 | issue = 8 | pages = 436–44 | date = August 1980 | pmid = 6248784 | doi = 10.1056/nejm198008213030806 }}</ref>

The adrenals contribute about 7% of circulating [[norepinephrine]], most of which is a spill over from [[neurotransmission]] with little activity as a hormone.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cryer PE | title = Isotope-derivative measurements of plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine in man | journal = Diabetes | volume = 25 | issue = 11 | pages = 1071–82 | date = November 1976 | pmid = 825406 | doi = 10.2337/diab.25.11.1071 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Gerich J, et al.

The term "adrenergic" is often misinterpreted in that the main sympathetic neurotransmitter is norepinephrine (noradrenaline), rather than epinephrine, as discovered by [[Ulf von Euler]] in 1946.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Von Euler|first=US|title=A specific sympathomimetic ergone in adrenergic nerve fibres (sympathin) and its relations to adrenaline and nor adrenaline|journal=Acta Physiol Scand|year=1946|volume=12|pages=73–97|doi=10.1111/j.1748-1716.1946.tb00368.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Von Euler US, Hillarp NA | title = Evidence for the presence of noradrenaline in submicroscopic structures of adrenergic axons | journal = Nature | volume = 177 | issue = 4497 | pages = 44–5 | date = January 1956 | pmid = 13288591 | doi = 10.1038/177044b0 | bibcode = 1956Natur.177...44E }}</ref>

Epinephrine does have a β<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptor-mediated effect on [[metabolism]] and the [[airway]], there being no direct neural connection from the [[sympathetic ganglia]] to the [[airway]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Warren J | title = The adrenal medulla and the airway | journal = British Journal of Diseases of the Chest | volume = 80 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–6 | date = January 1986 | pmid = 3004549 | doi = 10.1016/0007-0971(86)90002-1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Twentyman OP, Disley A, Gribbin HR, Alberti KG, Tattersfield AE | title = Effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on respiratory and metabolic responses to exercise | journal = Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 51 | issue = 4 | pages = 788–93 | date = October 1981 | pmid = 6795164 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Richter EA, Galbo H, Christensen NJ | title = Control of exercise-induced muscular glycogenolysis by adrenal medullary hormones in rats | journal = Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 50 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–6 | date = January 1981 | pmid = 7009527 }}</ref>

The concept of the adrenal medulla and the [[sympathetic nervous system]] being involved in the flight, fight and fright response was originally proposed by [[Walter Bradford Cannon|Cannon]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Canon|first=WB.|title=Studies on the conditions of activity in endocrine organs xxvii.

A link between what we now know as the sympathetic system and the lung was shown in 1887 when Grossman showed that stimulation of cardiac accelerator nerves reversed muscarine induced airway constriction.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Grossman|first=M | name-list-format = vanc |title=Das muscarin-lungen-odem|journal=Z Klin Med|year=1887|volume=12|pages=550–591.}}</ref> In elegant experiments in the dog, where the sympathetic chain was cut at the level of the diaphragm, Jackson showed that there was no direct sympathetic innervation to the lung, but that bronchoconstriction was reversed by release of epinephrine from the adrenal medulla.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors= Jackson DE | title = The pulmonary action of the adrenal glands|journal=J Pharmac Exp Therap|year=1912|volume=4|pages=59–74.}}</ref> An increased incidence of asthma has not been reported for adrenalectomized patients; those with a predisposition to asthma will have some protection from airway hyper-reactivity from their corticosteroid replacement therapy.

===Emotional response===
Every emotional response has a behavioral component, an autonomic component, and a hormonal component. The hormonal component includes the release of epinephrine, an adrenomedullary response that occurs in response to stress and that is controlled by the [[sympathetic nervous system]]. The major emotion studied in relation to epinephrine is fear. In an experiment, subjects who were injected with epinephrine expressed more negative and fewer positive facial expressions to fear films compared to a control group. These subjects also reported a more intense fear from the films and greater mean intensity of negative memories than control subjects.<ref name="Mezzacappa, E.S. 1999">{{cite journal | last1 = Mezzacappa | first1 = E.S. | last2 = Katkin | first2 = E.S. | last3 = Palmer | first3 = S.N. | name-list-format = vanc | year = 1999 | title = Epinephrine, arousal, and emotion: A new look at two-factor theory | url = | journal = Cognition and Emotion | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 181–199 | doi = 10.1080/026999399379320}}</ref> The findings from this study demonstrate that there are learned associations between negative feelings and levels of epinephrine. Overall, the greater amount of epinephrine is positively correlated with an arousal state of negative feelings. These findings can be an effect in part that epinephrine elicits physiological sympathetic responses including an increased heart rate and knee shaking, which can be attributed to the feeling of fear regardless of the actual level of fear elicited from the video. Although studies have found a definite relation between epinephrine and fear, other emotions have not had such results. In the same study, subjects did not express a greater amusement to an amusement film nor greater anger to an anger film.<ref name="Mezzacappa, E.S. 1999"/> Similar findings were also supported in a study that involved rodent subjects that either were able or unable to produce epinephrine. Findings support the idea that epinephrine does have a role in facilitating the encoding of emotionally arousing events, contributing to higher levels of arousal due to fear.<ref name="Mate, T. 2013">{{cite journal | vauthors = Toth M, Ziegler M, Sun P, Gresack J, Risbrough V | title = Impaired conditioned fear response and startle reactivity in epinephrine-deficient mice | journal = Behavioural Pharmacology | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–9 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23268986 | pmc = 3558035 | doi = 10.1097/FBP.0b013e32835cf408 }}</ref>

===Memory===
It has been found that adrenergic hormones, such as epinephrine, can produce retrograde enhancement of [[long-term memory]] in humans. The release of epinephrine due to emotionally stressful events, which is endogenous epinephrine, can modulate memory consolidation of the events, ensuring memory strength that is proportional to memory importance. Post-learning epinephrine activity also interacts with the degree of arousal associated with the initial coding.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cahill L, Alkire MT | title = Epinephrine enhancement of human memory consolidation: interaction with arousal at encoding | journal = Neurobiology of Learning and Memory | volume = 79 | issue = 2 | pages = 194–8 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12591227 | doi = 10.1016/S1074-7427(02)00036-9 }}</ref> There is evidence that suggests epinephrine does have a role in long-term stress adaptation and emotional memory encoding specifically. Epinephrine may also play a role in elevating arousal and fear memory under particular pathological conditions including post-traumatic stress disorder.<ref name="Mate, T. 2013" /> Overall, "Extensive evidence indicates that epinephrine (EPI) modulates memory consolidation for emotionally arousing tasks in animals and human subjects.”<ref name="Dornelles, A. 2007">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dornelles A, de Lima MN, Grazziotin M, Presti-Torres J, Garcia VA, Scalco FS, Roesler R, Schröder N | title = Adrenergic enhancement of consolidation of object recognition memory | journal = Neurobiology of Learning and Memory | volume = 88 | issue = 1 | pages = 137–42 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17368053 | doi = 10.1016/j.nlm.2007.01.005 }}</ref>
Studies have also found that recognition memory involving epinephrine depends on a mechanism that depends on β adrenoceptors.<ref name="Dornelles, A. 2007" /> Epinephrine does not readily cross the blood–brain barrier, so its effects on memory consolidation are at least partly initiated by β adrenoceptors in the periphery. Studies have found that [[sotalol]], a [[Beta blocker|β adrenoceptor antagonist]] that also does not readily enter the brain, blocks the enhancing effects of peripherally administered epinephrine on memory.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Roozendaal B, McGaugh JL | title = Memory modulation | journal = Behavioral Neuroscience | volume = 125 | issue = 6 | pages = 797–824 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22122145 | doi = 10.1037/a0026187 | pmc=3236701}}</ref> These findings suggest that β adrenoceptors are necessary for epinephrine to have an effect on memory consolidation.

For noradrenaline to be acted upon by PNMT in the cytosol, it must first be shipped out of [[chromaffin granule|granules]] of the chromaffin cells. This may occur via the catecholamine-H<sup>+</sup> exchanger [[VMAT1]]. VMAT1 is also responsible for transporting newly synthesized adrenaline from the cytosol back into chromaffin granules in preparation for release.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/FamilyDisplayForward?familyId=193|title= SLC18 family of vesicular amine transporters|date= |website= Guide to Pharmacology|publisher= IUPHAR/BPS|access-date= 21 August 2015}}</ref>

In liver cells, adrenaline binds to the [[Adrenergic receptor#β receptors|β adrenergic receptor]], which changes conformation and helps G<sub>s</sub>, a G protein, exchange GDP to GTP. This trimeric G protein dissociates to G<sub>s</sub> alpha and G<sub>s</sub> beta/gamma subunits. Gs alpha binds to adenyl cyclase, thus converting ATP into cyclic AMP. Cyclic AMP binds to the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A: Protein kinase A phosphorylates phosphorylase kinase. Meanwhile, Gs beta/gamma binds to the calcium channel and allows calcium ions to enter the cytoplasm. Calcium ions bind to calmodulin proteins, a protein present in all eukaryotic cells, which then binds to phosphorylase kinase and finishes its activation. Phosphorylase kinase phosphorylates [[glycogen phosphorylase]], which then phosphorylates glycogen and converts it to glucose-6-phosphate. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Increased epinephrine secretion is observed in [[phaeochromocytoma]], hypoglycaemia, myocardial infarction and to a lesser degree in benign essential familial tremor. A general increase in sympathetic neural activity is usually accompanied by increased adrenaline secretion, but there is selectivity during hypoxia and hypoglycaemia, when the ratio of adrenaline to noradrenaline is considerably increased.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Feldberg W, Minz B, Tsudzimura H | title = The mechanism of the nervous discharge of adrenaline | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 81 | issue = 3 | pages = 286–304 | date = June 1934 | pmid = 16994544 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.1934.sp003136 | pmc=1394156}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Burn JH, Hutcheon DE, Parker RH | title = Adrenaline and noradrenaline in the suprarenal medulla after insulin | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology and Chemotherapy | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 417–23 | date = September 1950 | pmid = 14777865 | doi = 10.1111/j.1476-5381.1950.tb00591.x | pmc=1509946}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Outschoorn AS | title = The hormones of the adrenal medulla and their release | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology and Chemotherapy | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 605–15 | date = December 1952 | pmid = 13019029 | doi = 10.1111/j.1476-5381.1952.tb00728.x | pmc=1509311}}</ref> Therefore, there must be some autonomy of the adrenal medulla from the rest of the sympathetic system.

Low, or absent, concentrations of epinephrine can be seen in autonomic neuropathy or following adrenalectomy. Failure of the adrenal cortex, as with Addisons disease, can suppress epinephrine secretion as the activity of the synthesing enzyme, [[Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase|phenylethanolamine-''N''-methyltransferase]], depends on the high concentration of cortisol that drains from the cortex to the medulla.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wurtman RJ, Pohorecky LA, Baliga BS | title = Adrenocortical control of the biosynthesis of epinephrine and proteins in the adrenal medulla | journal = Pharmacological Reviews | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 411–26 | date = June 1972 | pmid = 4117970 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wright A, Jones IC | title = Chromaffin tissue in the lizard adrenal gland | journal = Nature | volume = 175 | issue = 4466 | pages = 1001–2 | date = June 1955 | pmid = 14394091 | doi = 10.1038/1751001b0 | bibcode = 1955Natur.175.1001W }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Coupland RE | title = On the morphology and adrenaline-nor-adrenaline content of chromaffin tissue | journal = The Journal of Endocrinology | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 194–203 | date = April 1953 | pmid = 13052791 | doi = 10.1677/joe.0.0090194 }}</ref>

==Terminology==
Epinephrine is the [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical's]] [[United States Adopted Name]] and [[International Nonproprietary Name]], though the name adrenaline is frequently used. The term ''epinephrine ''was coined by the pharmacologist [[John Jacob Abel|John Abel]] (from the Greek for "on top of the kidneys"), who used the name to describe the extracts he prepared from the [[adrenal glands]] as early as 1897.<ref name="BMJ">{{cite journal | vauthors = Aronson JK | title = "Where name and image meet"--the argument for "adrenaline" | journal = BMJ | volume = 320 | issue = 7233 | pages = 506–9 | date = February 2000 | pmid = 10678871 | pmc = 1127537 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.320.7233.506 }}</ref> In 1901, [[Jokichi Takamine]] patented a purified adrenal extract, and called it "adrenalin" (from the Latin for "on top of the kidneys"), which was [[List of generic and genericized trademarks|trademark]]ed by [[Parke-Davis|Parke, Davis & Co]] in the U.S.<ref name="BMJ" /> In the belief that Abel's extract was the same as Takamine's, a belief since disputed, epinephrine became{{when|date=February 2017}} the generic name in the U.S.<ref name="BMJ" /> The [[British Approved Name]] and [[European Pharmacopoeia]] term for this drug is adrenaline and is indeed now one of the few differences between the INN and BAN systems of names.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Howweregulate/Medicines/Namingofmedicines/ChangestomedicinesnamesBANstorINNs/index.htm|title=Naming human medicines – GOV.UK|website=www.mhra.gov.uk}}</ref>

Among American health professionals and scientists, the term ''epinephrine'' is used over ''adrenaline''. However, pharmaceuticals that mimic the effects of epinephrine are often called adrenergics, and receptors for epinephrine are called adrenergic receptors or adrenoceptors.

As a hormone, epinephrine acts on nearly all body tissues. Its actions vary by tissue type and tissue expression of [[adrenergic receptor]]s. For example, high levels of epinephrine causes [[smooth muscle]] relaxation in the airways but causes contraction of the smooth muscle that lines most [[arteriole]]s.

Epinephrine acts by binding to a variety of [[adrenergic receptor]]s. Epinephrine is a nonselective [[agonist]] of all adrenergic receptors, including the major subtypes [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>]], [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>2</sub>]], [[Beta-1 adrenergic receptor|β<sub>1</sub>]], [[Beta-2 adrenergic receptor|β<sub>2</sub>]], and [[Beta-3 adrenergic receptor|β<sub>3</sub>]].<ref name="pharmnemonics">{{Cite book | author=Shen, Howard | title=Illustrated Pharmacology Memory Cards: PharMnemonics | year=2008 | publisher=Minireview | isbn=1-59541-101-1 | pages=4}}</ref> Epinephrine's binding to these receptors triggers a number of metabolic changes.

Its actions are to increase peripheral resistance via [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub> receptor]]-dependent [[vasoconstriction]] and to increase [[cardiac output]] via its binding to β<sub>1</sub> receptors. The goal of reducing peripheral circulation is to increase coronary and cerebral perfusion pressures and therefore increase oxygen exchange at the cellular level.<ref name="Australian Resuscitation Council Guideline 11.5 - Drugs in Cardiac Arrest">{{cite web |title=Guideline 11.5: Medications in Adult Cardiac Arrest|url=http://resus.org.au/?wpfb_dl=55|format=PDF|work=Australian Resuscitation Council|date=December 2010|accessdate=7 March 2015}}</ref> While epinephrine does increase aortic, cerebral, and carotid circulation pressure, it lowers carotid blood flow and [[capnography|end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>]] or E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> levels.

==Measurement in biological fluids==
Epinephrine may be quantified in blood, plasma or serum as a diagnostic aid, to monitor therapeutic administration, or to identify the causative agent in a potential poisoning victim. Endogenous plasma epinephrine concentrations in resting adults are normally less than 10&nbsp;ng/L, but may increase by 10-fold during exercise and by 50-fold or more during times of stress. [[Pheochromocytoma]] patients often have plasma adrenaline levels of 1000–10,000&nbsp;ng/L. Parenteral administration of epinephrine to acute-care cardiac patients can produce plasma concentrations of 10,000 to 100,000&nbsp;ng/L.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Raymondos K, Panning B, Leuwer M, Brechelt G, Korte T, Niehaus M, Tebbenjohanns J, Piepenbrock S | title = Absorption and hemodynamic effects of airway administration of adrenaline in patients with severe cardiac disease | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 132 | issue = 10 | pages = 800–3 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10819703 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-132-10-200005160-00007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=R. |last=Baselt |title=Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man |edition=8th |publisher=Biomedical Publications |location=Foster City, CA |year=2008 |pages=545–547 |isbn=0-9626523-7-7}}</ref>

==Biosynthesis and regulation==
[[File:Catecholamines biosynthesis.svg|thumb|right|250px|The biosynthesis of adrenaline involves a series of enzymatic reactions.]]
In chemical terms, epinephrine is one of a group of [[monoamine]]s called the [[catecholamine]]s. It is produced in some [[neuron]]s of the [[central nervous system]], and in the [[Medullary chromaffin cell|chromaffin cell]]s of the [[adrenal medulla]] from the [[amino acid]]s [[phenylalanine]] and [[tyrosine]].<ref name="HalbachDermietzel2006">{{cite book | last1 = von Bohlen und Haibach | first1 = O | last2 = Dermietzel | first2 = R | name-list-format = vanc | title = Neurotransmitters and Neuromodulators: Handbook of Receptors and Biological Effects | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AfmA_KJMjJAC&pg=PA125 | year = 2006 | publisher = Wiley-VCH | isbn = 978-3-527-31307-5 | page = 125 }}</ref>

Epinephrine is synthesized in the medulla of the [[adrenal gland]] in an [[enzymatic pathway]] that converts the [[amino acid]] [[tyrosine]] into a series of intermediates and, ultimately, epinephrine. Tyrosine is first oxidized to [[L-DOPA|<small>L</small>-DOPA]], which is subsequently decarboxylated to give [[dopamine]]. Oxidation gives [[norepinephrine]]. The final step in epinephrine biosynthesis is the [[methylation]] of the [[primary amine]] of [[norepinephrine]]. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme [[phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase|phenylethanolamine ''N''-methyltransferase]] (PNMT) which utilizes [[S-adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl methionine]] (SAMe) as the [[methyl]] donor.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kirshner N, Goodall M | title = The formation of adrenaline from noradrenaline | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 658–9 | date = June 1957 | pmid = 13436503 | doi = 10.1016/0006-3002(57)90271-8 }}</ref> While PNMT is found primarily in the [[cytosol]] of the [[endocrine]] cells of the [[adrenal medulla]] (also known as [[chromaffin cell]]s), it has been detected at low levels in both the [[heart]] and [[brain]].<ref name ="Axelrod">{{cite journal | last = Axelrod | first = Julius | name-list-format = vanc | title = Purification and Properties of Phenylethanolamine-N-methyl Transferase|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=May 1962|volume=237|issue=5|pages=1657–1660}}</ref>

===Regulation===
The major physiologic triggers of adrenaline release center upon [[stress (medicine)|stresses]], such as physical threat, excitement, noise, bright lights, and high ambient temperature. All of these stimuli are processed in the [[central nervous system]].<ref>{{cite book |first=L. |last=Nelson |first2=M. |last2=Cox | name-list-format = vanc |year=2004 |title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry |edition=4th |location=New York |publisher=Freeman |page=908 |isbn=0-7167-4339-6}}</ref>

[[Adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH) and the [[sympathetic nervous system]] stimulate the synthesis of adrenaline precursors by enhancing the activity of [[tyrosine hydroxylase]] and [[Dopamine beta-hydroxylase|dopamine β-hydroxylase]], two key enzymes involved in catecholamine synthesis.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} ACTH also stimulates the [[adrenal cortex]] to release [[cortisol]], which increases the expression of PNMT in chromaffin cells, enhancing adrenaline synthesis. This is most often done in response to stress.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The sympathetic nervous system, acting via [[splanchnic nerve]]s to the adrenal medulla, stimulates the release of adrenaline. [[Acetylcholine]] released by preganglionic sympathetic fibers of these nerves acts on [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s, causing cell depolarization and an influx of [[calcium]] through [[voltage-gated calcium channel]]s. Calcium triggers the exocytosis of chromaffin granules and, thus, the release of adrenaline (and noradrenaline) into the bloodstream.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RJpEbB9_c9MC|title=Pharmacology for Anesthetists 5, p52|publisher=PediaPress|language=en}}</ref>

Unlike many other hormones adrenaline (as with other catecholamines) does not exert [[negative feedback]] to [[down-regulate]] its own synthesis.<ref>{{cite web |title=Adrenaline – Epinephrine |url=http://www.worldofmolecules.com/emotions/adrenaline.htm |work=World of Molecules |accessdate=7 March 2015}}</ref> Abnormally elevated levels of adrenaline can occur in a variety of conditions, such as surreptitious epinephrine administration, [[pheochromocytoma]], and other tumors of the [[sympathetic ganglia]].

Its action is terminated with reuptake into nerve terminal endings, some minute dilution, and metabolism by [[monoamine oxidase]] and [[catechol-O-methyl transferase|catechol-''O''-methyl transferase]].
