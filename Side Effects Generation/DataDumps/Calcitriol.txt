'''Calcitriol''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]), also called '''1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol''' or '''1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub>''', is the hormonally active metabolite of [[vitamin D]] with three [[alcohol group|hydroxyl group]]s (abbreviated '''1,25-(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>''' or simply '''1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D''').<ref>[http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/misc/D.html "Nomenclature of Vitamin D.

== Nomenclature ==
Calcitriol usually refers specifically to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol.  Because [[cholecalciferol]] already has one hydroxyl group, only two are further specified in the nomenclature.

=== Pharmaceutical trade names ===
Calcitriol is marketed under various trade names including Rocaltrol ([[Hoffman-La Roche|Roche]]), Calcijex ([[Abbott Laboratories|Abbott]]), Decostriol (Mibe, Jesalis), Vectical ([[Galderma]]), and Rolsical ([[Sun Pharmaceutical|Sun Pharma]]).

== Function ==
Calcitriol increases blood calcium levels ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]) by: 
* Promoting absorption of dietary calcium from the [[gastrointestinal tract]].
* Increasing [[Renal tubule|renal tubular]] reabsorption of calcium, thus reducing the loss of calcium in the urine. 
* Stimulating release of calcium from bone. For this it acts on the specific type of bone cells referred to as [[osteoblasts]], causing them to release [[RANKL]], which in turn activates [[osteoclasts]].<ref>Bringhurst, F. R; Demay, Marie B.; Krane, Stephen M.; Kronenberg, Henry M. "Bone and Mineral Metabolism in Health and Disease", chapter 346 in Fauci, Anthony S.; Braunwald, E.; Kasper, D. L.; Hauser, S. L.; Longo D. L.; Jameson, J. L.; Loscalzo, J. (2008). ''Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine'', 17th edition. New York: McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|978-0-07-159991-7}}. [http://www.accessmedicine.com/content.aspx?aID=2882031 Available online] at AccessMedicine.com, purchase required.</ref> 

Calcitriol acts in concert with [[parathyroid hormone]] (PTH) in all three of these roles. For instance, PTH also indirectly stimulates osteoclasts. However, the main effect of PTH is to increase the rate at which the kidneys excrete [[inorganic phosphate]] (P<sub>i</sub>), the [[counterion]] of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The resulting decrease in serum phosphate causes hydroxyapatite (Ca<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>OH) to dissolve out of bone thus increasing serum calcium. PTH also stimulates the production of calcitriol (see below).<ref name=Voet/>

Many of the effects of calcitriol are mediated by its interaction with the [[calcitriol receptor]], also called the vitamin D receptor or VDR. For instance, the unbound inactive form of the calcitriol receptor in intestinal epithelial cells resides in the [[cytoplasm]]. When calcitriol binds to the receptor, the [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]]-receptor complex translocates to the [[cell nucleus]], where it acts as a [[transcription factor]] promoting the expression of a gene encoding a [[Vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding protein|calcium binding protein]]. The levels of the calcium binding protein increase enabling the cells to actively transport more calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) from the intestine across the [[intestinal mucosa]] into the blood.<ref name=Voet/>

The maintenance of electroneutrality requires that the transport of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions catalyzed by the intestinal epithelial cells be accompanied by [[counterion]]s, primarily inorganic phosphate. Thus calcitriol also stimulates the intestinal absorption of phosphate.<ref name=Voet/>

The observation that calcitriol stimulates the release of calcium from bone seems contradictory, given that sufficient levels of serum calcitriol generally prevent overall loss of calcium from bone. It is believed that the increased levels of serum calcium resulting from calcitriol-stimulated intestinal uptake causes bone to take up more calcium than it loses by hormonal stimulation of osteoclasts.<ref name=Voet/> Only when there are conditions, such as dietary calcium deficiency or defects in intestinal transport, which result in a reduction of serum calcium does an overall loss of calcium from bone occur.

Calcitriol also inhibits the release of [[calcitonin]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} a hormone which reduces blood calcium primarily by inhibiting calcium release from bone.<ref name=Voet/> (The effect of calcitonin on renal excretion is disputed.)<ref name="pmid9058369">{{cite journal | author = Carney SL | title = Calcitonin and human renal calcium and electrolyte transport | journal = Miner Electrolyte Metab | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 43–7 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9058369 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref>

== Biosynthesis and its regulation ==
Calcitriol is produced in the cells of the [[proximal tubule]] of the [[nephron]] in the kidneys by the action of [[25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-hydroxylase|25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> 1-alpha-hydroxylase]], a [[mitochondria]]l [[oxygenase]] and an [[enzyme]] which catalyzes the [[hydroxylation]] of [[Calcifediol|25-hydroxycholecalciferol (calcifediol)]]. The activity of the enzyme is stimulated by PTH. The reaction is an important control point in [[Calcium metabolism|Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis]].<ref name=Voet/>

The production of calcitriol is also increased by [[prolactin]], a hormone which stimulates [[lactogenesis]] (the formation of milk in [[mammary glands]]), a process which requires large amounts of calcium. It is decreased by high levels of serum phosphate and by an increase in the production of the hormone [[FGF-23]] by osteocyte cells in bone.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Metabolism==
Calcitriol becomes [[calcitroic acid]] through the action of [[CYP24A1|24-hydroxylase]]. Calcitroic acid is excreted in the urine.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Medical use==
Calcitriol is prescribed for:<ref name="AMH2006">Rossi S, editor. [[Australian Medicines Handbook]] 2006. Adelaide: Australian Medicines Handbook; 2006. {{ISBN|0-9757919-2-3}}</ref>

*Treatment of [[osteoporosis]]
*Prevention of [[corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis]]

Calcitriol is also sometimes used topically in the treatment of [[psoriasis]], however the evidence to support its efficacy is not well established.<ref name="MicromedexDrugdex">Calcitriol.

==Adverse effects==
The main [[adverse drug reaction]] associated with calcitriol therapy is [[hypercalcemia]] – early symptoms include: [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[constipation]], [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[apathy]], [[headache]], [[thirst]], [[pruritus]], [[sweating]], and/or [[polyuria]]. Compared to other vitamin D compounds in clinical use ([[cholecalciferol]], [[ergocalciferol]]), calcitriol has a higher risk of inducing hypercalcemia. However, such episodes may be shorter and easier to treat due to its relatively short [[elimination half-life|half-life]].<ref name="AMH2006" />
