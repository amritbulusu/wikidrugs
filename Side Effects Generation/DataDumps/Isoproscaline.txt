'''Isoproscaline''' or '''4-(i)-propoxy-3,5-di[[methoxy]][[phenethylamine]]''' is an analogue of [[mescaline]].  It is closely related to [[proscaline]] and was first synthesized by [[David E. Nichols]].  It produces [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic]], [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]], and [[entheogen]]ic effects.

==Chemistry==

Isoproscaline is in a class of compounds commonly known as [[phenethylamine]]s, and the full chemical name is 2-(4-isopropoxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)ethanamine.

==Effects==

Little is known about the [[psychopharmacological]] effects of isoproscaline.  [[Alexander Shulgin]] lists a psychedelic dosage as being 40–80&nbsp;mg, with effects lasting 12–18 hours.

==Pharmacology==

The mechanism that produces the hallucinogenic and entheogenic effects of isoproscaline is most likely to result from action as a [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]] [[5-HT receptor|serotonin receptor]] [[agonist]] in the brain, a mechanism of action shared by all of the hallucinogenic tryptamines and phenethylamines.

==Dangers==

The toxicity of isoproscaline is not known.

==Legality==

Isoproscaline is unscheduled and unregulated in the [[United States]], however because of its close similarity in structure and effects to [[mescaline]], possession and sale of isoproscaline may be subject to prosecution under the [[Federal Analog Act]].

In the UK its highly likely that this compound would be covered by the "phenylethylamine amendment" to the misuse of drugs act likely rendering it (probably) a Class A controlled drug.
