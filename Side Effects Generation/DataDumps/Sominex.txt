'''Sominex''' is the trademarked name for several [[Over-the-counter drug|over the counter]] sleep aids. 

Two different formulations of Sominex are available, depending upon the market. Both formulations contain a significant dose of a [[H1 antagonist#First-generation (non-selective, classical)|first generation]] [[antihistamine]] with [[hypnotic]] properties.

In the United States, Sominex is marketed by [[Prestige Brands]] and has as its active ingredient [[diphenhydramine]] hydrochloride.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://blogs.newsobserver.com/business/gsk-sells-bc-goodys-and-other-brands | work=[[News & Observer]] | first=David | last=Ranii | title=GSK sells BC, Goody's and other brands | date=21 December 2011}}</ref> [[Diphenhydramine]] hydrochloride is also marketed as a sleep aid in Canada under the same name.

In the UK, [[Actavis|Actavis UK]] markets [[promethazine]] hydrochloride under the Sominex name.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sominex-sleep.co.uk/contact.htm |title= - A night time sleep aid - Contact Us |first= |last=|year=2011 |quote=Actavis UK Ltd |accessdate=9 July 2011}}</ref> Actavis also markets a product by the name of Sominex Herbal, which is a [[herbal medicine|herbal]] sleep aid with three natural active ingredients: [[hops]], [[Valerian (herb)|valerian]], and [[passion flower]] [[extracts]].

In India, the Sominex<ref>http://lunarbio.com/sominex_a.html</ref> name is used by Lunar BioPharma Pvt. Ltd. to market a nutritional supplement intended to provide "long lasting relief from heart burn, acid peptic disorders and indigestion".<ref>http://www.snapdeal.com/product/lunar-sominex/520532</ref><ref>http://www.pepperfry.com/lunar-sominex-162147.html</ref> This formulation of Sominex is not related to the two formulations (containing either [[diphenhydramine]] or [[promethazine]]) that are marketed as sleep aids by [[Prestige Brands]] and [[Actavis]] in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively.

[[Diphenhydramine]] and [[promethazine]] are both marketed by names other than Sominex for several indications including and besides their use as sleep aids. For example, [[diphenhydramine]] is sold under the brand name Benadryl as an anti-histamine for use against allergies. Tylenol PM contains [[diphenhydramine]] in addition to [[acetaminophen]] for the purpose of inducing sleep and reducing pain and/or fever. [[Promethazine]] is marketed by the brand name Phenergan for use against allergy symptoms and motion sickness in the US, where a prescription for [[promethazine]] is required. It is also available in the form of a syrup either alone or in combination with one or more of several other active ingredients including codeine and dextromethorphan, for the treatment of allergy symptoms, cough, or cold, among other uses. In Canada, [[promethazine]] is available as an over the counter anti-histamine by the name of Histantil.
