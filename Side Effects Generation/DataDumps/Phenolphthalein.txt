'''Phenolphthalein''' is a [[chemical compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] [[carbon|C]]<sub>20</sub>[[hydrogen|H]]<sub>14</sub>[[oxygen|O]]<sub>4</sub> and is often written as "'''HIn'''" or "'''phph'''" in shorthand notation. Phenolphthalein is often used as an indicator in [[acid–base titration]]s. For this application, it turns colorless in [[acid]]ic solutions and pink in [[base (chemistry)|basic]] solutions.

Phenolphthalein is slightly soluble in [[water]] and usually is dissolved in [[alcohol]]s for use in [[experiment]]s. It is a weak acid, which can lose H<sup>+</sup> ions in solution. The phenolphthalein molecule is colorless, and the phenolphthalein ion is pink. When a base is added to the phenolphthalein, the molecule ⇌ ions equilibrium shifts to the right, leading to more ionization as H<sup>+</sup> ions are removed. This is predicted by [[Le Chatelier's principle]].

==Uses==

===Indicator===
Phenolphthalein's common use is as an indicator in acid-base titrations. It also serves as a component of [[universal indicator]], together with [[methyl red]], [[bromothymol blue]], and [[thymol blue]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iscid.org/encyclopedia/Universal_Indicator |title=Universal Indicator |work=ISCID Encyclopedia of Science and Philosophy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925035727/http://www.iscid.org/encyclopedia/Universal_Indicator |archivedate=September 25, 2006 }}</ref>

Phenolphthalein adopts four different states in aqueous solution: Under very strongly acidic conditions, it exists in protonated form, providing an orange coloration. Between strongly acidic and slightly basic conditions, the lactone form is colorless. The singly deprotonated phenolate form (the [[anion]] form of phenol) gives the familiar pink color. In strongly basic solutions, phenolphthalein's pink color undergoes a rather slow fading reaction and becomes completely colorless above 13.0 pH. The rather slow fading reaction that produces the colorless In(OH)<sup>3−</sup> ion is sometimes used in classes for the study of reaction kinetics.

Phenolphthalein's pH sensitivity is exploited in other applications: Concrete has naturally high pH due to the [[calcium hydroxide]] formed when [[Portland cement]] reacts with water. As the concrete reacts with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, pH decreases to 8.5-9. When a 1% phenolphthalein solution is applied to normal concrete, it turns bright pink. However, if it remains colorless, it shows that the concrete has undergone carbonation. In a similar application, [[spackling]] used to repair holes in drywall contains phenolphthalein. When applied, the basic spackling material retains a pink coloration; when the spackling has cured by reaction with atmospheric carbon dioxide, the pink color fades.<ref>{{cite patent | country = US | number = 6531528  | title = Ready to use spackle/repair product containing dryness indicator | year = 2003 | inventor = Ronald D. Kurp | assignee = Dap Products Inc.}}</ref>

Phenolphthalein is used in toys, for example as a component of disappearing inks, or disappearing dye on the Hollywood Hair [[Barbie]] hair. In the ink, it is mixed with [[sodium hydroxide]], which reacts with carbon dioxide in the air. This reaction leads to the pH falling below the color change threshold as hydrogen ions are released by the reaction:
:[[hydroxide|OH<sup>−</sup>]]<sub>[[aqueous|(aq)]]</sub> + [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]<sub>[[gaseous|(g)]]</sub> → [[carbonate|{{chem|CO|3|2−}}]]<sub>(aq)</sub> + [[proton|H<sup>+</sup>]]<sub>(aq)</sub>

To develop the hair and "magic" graphical patterns, the ink is sprayed with a solution of hydroxide, which leads to the appearance of the hidden graphics by the same mechanism described above for color change in alkaline solution. The pattern will eventually disappear again because of the reaction with [[carbon dioxide]]. [[Thymolphthalein]] is used for the same purpose and in the same way, when a blue color is desired.<ref>[http://www.chymist.com/Toystore%20part3.pdf Toystore]</ref>

===Medical uses===
Phenolphthalein has been used for over a century as a [[laxative]], but is now being removed from [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] laxatives<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 12708936 |date=May 2003 | author = Spiller, H.

Despite concerns regarding its [[carcinogenicity]], the use of phenolphthalein as a laxative is unlikely to cause [[ovarian cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Cooper | first = G.

A reduced form of phenolphthalein, phenolphthalin, which is colorless, is used in a test to identify substances thought to contain blood, commonly known as the [[Kastle-Meyer test]]. A dry sample is collected with a swab or filter paper. A few drops of alcohol, then a few drops of phenolphthalin, and finally a few drops of [[hydrogen peroxide]] are dripped onto the sample. If the sample contains hemoglobin, it will turn pink immediately upon addition of the peroxide, because of the generation of phenolphthalein. A positive test indicates the sample contains hemoglobin and, therefore, is likely blood. A false positive can result from the presence of substances with catalytic activity similar to heme. This test is not destructive to the sample; it can be kept and used in further tests. This test has the same reaction with blood from any animal, so further testing would be required to determine whether it originates from a human.

==Synthesis==
Phenolphthalein can be synthesized by condensation of [[phthalic anhydride]] with two equivalents of [[phenol]] under acidic conditions (hence the name). It was discovered in 1871 by [[Adolf von Baeyer]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Baeyer, A. | date = 1871 | title = Ueber eine neue Klasse von Farbstoffen | journal = Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 555–558 | doi = 10.1002/cber.18710040209 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Baeyer, A. | date = 1871 | title = Ueber die Phenolfarbstoffe | journal = Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 658–665 | doi = 10.1002/cber.18710040247 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Baeyer, A. | date = 1871 | title = Ueber die Phenolfarbstoffe | journal = Polytechnisches Journal | volume = 201 | issue = 89 | pages = 358–362 | url = http://dingler.culture.hu-berlin.de/article/pj201/ar201089 }}</ref>
