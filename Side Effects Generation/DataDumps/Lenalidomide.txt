'''Lenalidomide''' (trade name '''Revlimid''')  is a [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivative]] of [[thalidomide]] introduced in 2004.

It was initially intended as a treatment for [[multiple myeloma]], for which thalidomide is an accepted therapeutic treatment. Lenalidomide has also shown efficacy in the class of hematological disorders known as [[myelodysplastic syndrome]]s (MDS). Along with several other drugs developed in recent years, lenalidomide has significantly improved overall survival in myeloma (which formerly carried a poor prognosis), although toxicity remains an issue for users.<ref name="McCarthy">{{cite journal |vauthors=McCarthy PL, Owzar K, Hofmeister CC, Hurd DD, Hassoun H, Richardson PG, Giralt S, Stadtmauer EA, Weisdorf DJ, Vij R, Moreb JS, Callander NS, Van Besien K, Gentile T, Isola L, Maziarz RT, Gabriel DA, Bashey A, Landau H, Martin T, Qazilbash MH, Levitan D, McClune B, Schlossman R, Hars V, Postiglione J, Jiang C, Bennett E, Barry S, Bressler L, Kelly M, Seiler M, Rosenbaum C, Hari P, Pasquini MC, Horowitz MM, Shea TC, Devine SM, Anderson KC, Linker C |title=Lenalidomide after stem-cell transplantation for multiple myeloma |journal=N.

Compared to placebo, lenalidomide is effective at inducing a complete or "very good partial" response as well as improving progression-free survival. Adverse events more common in people receiving lenalidomide for myeloma were [[neutropenia]] (a decrease in the white blood cell count), [[deep vein thrombosis]], [[infection]]s, and an increased risk of other [[hematological malignancy|hematological malignancies]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Yang|first=B|author2=Yu, RL |author3=Chi, XH |author4= Lu, XC |title=Lenalidomide treatment for multiple myeloma: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2013|volume=8|issue=5|pages=e64354|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0064354|pmid=23691202|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0064354|pmc=3653900}}</ref> The risk of second primary hematological malignancies does not outweigh the benefit of using lenalidomide in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dimopoulos|first=MA|author2=Richardson, PG |author3=Brandenburg, N |author4=Yu, Z |author5=Weber, DM |author6=Niesvizky, R |author7= Morgan, GJ |title=A review of second primary malignancy in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma treated with lenalidomide.|journal=Blood|date=Mar 22, 2012|volume=119|issue=12|pages=2764–7|doi=10.1182/blood-2011-08-373514|pmid=22323483|url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/content/119/12/2764.long}}</ref> It may be more difficult to mobilize stem cells for autograft in people who have received lenalidomide.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Li|first=Shirong|author2=Gill, Navkiranjit |author3=Lentzsch, Suzanne |title=Recent advances of IMiDs in cancer therapy|journal=Current Opinion in Oncology|date=November 2010|volume=22|issue=6|pages=579–585|doi=10.1097/CCO.0b013e32833d752c|pmid=20689431}}</ref>

On 29 June 2006, lenalidomide received [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) clearance for use in combination with [[dexamethasone]] in patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDER/ucm095626.htm|title=FDA approves lenalidomide oral capsules (Revlimid) for use in combination with dexamethasone in patients with multiple myeloma|quote= |date=2006-06-29|work= |publisher=FDA|accessdate=2015-10-15|description= |deadurl= |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}</ref>

On 23 April 2009, The [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE) issued a Final Appraisal Determination (FAD) approving lenalidomide, in combination with dexamethasone, as an option to treat patients with multiple myeloma who have received two or more prior therapies in England and Wales.<ref>{{Cite journal | title = REVLIMID Receives Positive Final Appraisal Determination from National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) for Use in the National Health Service (NHS) in England and Wales | publisher = Reuters | date = April 23, 2009 | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS83290+23-Apr-2009+BW20090423| postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>

On 5 June 2013 the FDA designated lenalidomide as a [[specialty drug]] requiring a [[specialty pharmacy]] distribution for "use in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in patients whose disease has relapsed or progressed after 2 prior therapies, 1 of which included [[bortezomib]]."

===Myelodysplastic syndromes ===
With [[myelodysplastic syndrome]]s (MDS), the best results of lenalidomide were obtained in patients with the [[Chromosome 5q deletion syndrome]] (5q- syndrome).<ref name=List>{{cite journal  |vauthors=List A, Kurtin S, Roe DJ, etal | title = Efficacy of lenalidomide in myelodysplastic syndromes | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 352 | issue = 6 | pages = 549–57 |date=February 2005 | pmid = 15703420 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa041668 }}</ref> The syndrome results from deletions in human chromosome 5 that remove three adjacent genes, [[granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor]], [[PDGFRB#PDGFRB mutations|Platelet-derived growth factor receptor B]], and [[Colony stimulating factor 1 receptor]].<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5159</ref><ref name="pmid16735711">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nimer SD | title = Clinical management of myelodysplastic syndromes with interstitial deletion of chromosome 5q | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 24 | issue = 16 | pages = 2576–82 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16735711 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2005.03.6715 | url = }}</ref>

It was approved by the FDA on December 27, 2005 for patients with low or intermediate-1 risk MDS with 5q- with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities. A completed Phase II, multi-centre, single-arm, open-label study  evaluated the efficacy and safety of Revlimid monotherapy treatment for achieving haematopoietic improvement in red blood cell (RBC) transfusion dependent subjects with low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality.

63.8% of subjects had achieved RBC-transfusion independence accompanied by a median increase of 5.8 g/dL in blood Hgb concentration from baseline to the maximum value during the response period. Major cytogenetic responses were observed in 44.2% and minor cytogenetic responses were observed in 24.2% of the evaluable subjects.  Improvements in bone marrow morphology were also observed.  The results of this study demonstrate the efficacy of Revlimid for the treatment of subjects with Low- or Intermediate-1-risk MDS and an associated del 5 cytogenetic abnormality.<ref name=List/><ref>{{cite journal

==Adverse effects==
Lenalidomide is related to [[thalidomide]] which is known to be [[teratogen]]ic. Tests in monkeys have suggested lenalidomide is also [[teratogen]]ic.<ref>{{cite web|title=Revlimid Summary of Product Characteristics. Annex I|year=2012|publisher=[[European Medicines Agency]]|page=6|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Product_Information/human/000717/WC500056018.pdf}}</ref> It therefore has the [[pregnancy category]] X  and cannot be prescribed for women who are pregnant or who might be conceiving. For this reason, the drug is only available in the [[United States]] (under the name Revlimid) through a restricted distribution system called RevAssist.

Other potential side effects are [[thrombosis]], [[pulmonary embolus]], and [[hepatotoxicity]], as well as bone marrow toxicity resulting in [[neutropenia]] and [[thrombocytopenia]]. [[Myelosuppression]] is the major dose-limiting toxicity, which is contrary to experience with thalidomide.<ref>{{cite journal

===Venous thromboembolism===
Lenalidomide, like its parent compound thalidomide, may cause [[venous thromboembolism]] (VTE), a potentially serious complication with their use. Bennett et al. have reviewed incidents of lenalidomide-associated VTE among patients with multiple myeloma.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bennett CL, Angelotta C, Yarnold PR, etal | title = Thalidomide- and lenalidomide-associated thromboembolism among patients with cancer| journal = JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association| volume = 296| issue = 21| pages = 2558–60|date=December 2006| pmid = 17148721| doi = 10.1001/jama.296.21.2558-c}}</ref> They have found that there are high rates of VTE when patients with multiple myeloma received thalidomide or lenalidomide in conjunction with [[dexamethasone]], [[melphalan]], or [[doxorubicin]]. When lenalidomide and dexamethasone are used to treat multiple myeloma, a median of 14% of patients had VTE (range,3-75%). In patients who took prophylaxis to treat lenalidomide-associated VTE, such as aspirin, thromboembolism rates were found to be lower than without prophylaxis, frequently lower than 10%. Clearly, thromboembolism is a serious adverse drug reaction associated with lenalidomide, as well as thalidomide. In fact, a black box warning is included in the package insert for lenalidomide, indicating that lenalidomide-dexamethasone treatment for multiple myeloma is complicated by high rates of thromboembolism.

Currently, clinical trials are under way to further test the efficacy of lenalidomide to treat multiple myeloma, and to determine how to prevent lenalidomide associated venous thromboembolism.

===Stevens-Johnson syndrome===
In March 2008, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) included lenalidomide on a list of 20 prescription drugs under investigation for potential safety problems. The drug is being investigated for possibly increasing the risk of developing [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]], a life-threatening condition affecting the skin.<ref>{{cite web

===FDA ongoing safety review===
As of 2011, the FDA has initiated an ongoing review of Revlimid. The review focuses on clinical trials which found that Revlimid caused an increased risk of developing new malignancies such as acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and B-cell lymphoma,<ref name="Badros"/> though the FDA is currently advising all patients on Revlimid to continue their treatment.<ref>{{cite web

==Mechanism of action==
Lenalidomide has been used to successfully treat both inflammatory disorders and cancers in the past 10 years. There are multiple [[mechanism of action|mechanisms of action]], and they can be simplified by organizing them as mechanisms of action ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo''.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Vallet S, Palumbo A, Raje N, Boccadoro M, Anderson KC |title = Thalidomide and lenalidomide: Mechanism-based potential drug combinations | journal = Leukemia & Lymphoma | volume = 49 | issue = 7 | pages = 1238–45|date=July 2008| pmid = 18452080| doi = 10.1080/10428190802005191}}</ref> ''In vitro'', lenalidomide has three main activities: direct [[anti-tumor]] effect, inhibition of angiogenesis, and [[Homeostasis|immunomodulation]]. ''In vivo'', lenalidomide induces tumor cell [[apoptosis]] directly and indirectly by inhibition of bone marrow [[stromal cell]] support, by [[anti-angiogenic]] and [[Osteoclast|anti-osteoclastogenic]] effects, and by immunomodulatory activity. Lenalidomide has a broad range of activities that can be exploited to treat many hematologic and solid cancers.

On a molecular level, lenalidomide has been shown to interact with the ubiquitin E3 ligase [[cereblon]]<ref>{{Cite journal

}}</ref> This mechanism was unexpected as it suggests that the major action of lenalidomide is to re-target the activity of an enzyme rather than block the activity of an enzyme or signaling process, and thereby represents a novel mode of drug action. A more specific implication of this mechanism is that the teratogenic and anti-neoplastic properties of lenalidomide, and perhaps other thalidomide derivatives, could be disassociated.

==Synthesis==
The low level of research that continued on thalidomide, in spite of its scandalous historical toxicity, unexpectedly showed that the compound affected immune function. The drug was, for example, recently approved by the FDA for treatment of complications from [[leprosy]]; it has also been investigated as an adjunct for treating some malignancies. Recent research on related compounds has revealed a series of molecules which inhibit [[tumor necrosis factor]] (TNF-α).

In 2013 the UK [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) rejected lenalidomide for "use in the treatment of people with a specific type of the bone marrow disorder [[myelodysplastic syndrome]] (MDS)" in England and Scotland, arguing that Celgene "did not provide enough evidence to justify the £3,780 per month (USD$5746.73) price-tag of lenalidomide for use in the treatment of people with a specific type of the bone marrow disorder myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)".<ref name="pmlive.com">{{cite web | url=http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/revlimid_faces_nice_rejection_for_use_in_rare_blood_cancer_488554 | title=Revlimid faces NICE rejection for use in rare blood cancer Watchdog's draft guidance does not recommend Celgene's drug for NHS use in England and Wales | publisher=Pharma News | date=11 July 2013 | accessdate=5 November 2015}}</ref>
