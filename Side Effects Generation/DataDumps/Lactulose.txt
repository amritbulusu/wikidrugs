==Medical uses==

===Constipation===
Lactulose is used in the treatment of chronic [[constipation]] in patients of all ages as a long-term treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682338.html|title=Lactulose|work=nih.gov|accessdate=25 August 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905124827/https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682338.html|archivedate=5 September 2015|df=}}</ref> Lactulose is used for [[chronic idiopathic constipation]], i.e. chronic constipation occurring without any identifiable cause. Lactulose may be used to counter the constipating effects of [[opioids]], and in the symptomatic treatment of [[hemorrhoids]] as a stool softener.

The dosage of lactulose for chronic idiopathic constipation is adjusted depending on the constipation severity and desired effect, from a mild stool softener to causing diarrhea. Dosage is reduced in case of [[galactosemia]] as most preparations contain the monosaccharide [[galactose]] due to its synthesis process.

===Hyperammonemia===
Lactulose is useful in treating [[hyperammonemia]] (high blood ammonia), which can lead to [[hepatic encephalopathy]]. Lactulose helps trap the [[ammonia]] (NH<sub>3</sub>) in the colon and bind to it.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shukla|first=S|author2=Shukla, A |author3=Mehboob, S |author4= Guha, S |title=Meta-analysis: the effects of gut flora modulation using prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics on minimal hepatic encephalopathy.|journal=Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics|date=Mar 2011|volume=33|issue=6|pages=662–71|pmid=21251030 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2036.2010.04574.x}}</ref>  It does this by using gut flora to acidify the colon, transforming the freely diffusible [[ammonia]] into [[ammonium]] ({{chem|NH|4|+}}) which can no longer diffuse back into the blood.<ref name="pmid3570029">{{cite journal |vauthors=Patil DH, Westaby D, Mahida YR, Palmer KR, Rees R, Clark ML, Dawson AM, Silk DB | title = Comparative modes of action of lactitol and lactulose in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy | journal = Gut | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 255–9 |date=March 1987 | pmid = 3570029 | pmc = 1432706 | doi = 10.1136/gut.28.3.255 }}</ref> It is also useful for preventing hyperammonemia caused as a side effect of administration of [[valproic acid]].<ref name="GerstnerBuesing2006">{{cite journal|last1=Gerstner|first1=Thorsten|last2=Buesing|first2=Deike|last3=Longin|first3=Elke|last4=Bendl|first4=Claudia|last5=Wenzel|first5=Dieter|last6=Scheid|first6=Brigitte|last7=Goetze|first7=Gisela|last8=Macke|first8=Alfons|last9=Lippert|first9=Gerhard|last10=Klostermann|first10=Wolfgang|last11=Mayer|first11=Geert|last12=Augspach-Hofmann|first12=Regine|last13=Fitzek|first13=Sabine|last14=Haensch|first14=Carl-Albrecht|last15=Reuland|first15=Markus|last16=Koenig|first16=Stephan A.|title=Valproic acid induced encephalopathy – 19 new cases in Germany from 1994 to 2003 – A side effect associated to VPA-therapy not only in young children|journal=Seizure|volume=15|issue=6|year=2006|pages=443–448|issn=1059-1311|doi=10.1016/j.seizure.2006.05.007|pmid=16787750}}</ref>

Lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy generally requires relatively large oral dosages three or four times a day with episodic diarrhea and constant flatulence almost a certain side effect. People who take lactulose at this level of dosage generally end up wearing an [[adult diaper]] and [[plastic pants]] for any activities away from home or at night (with a [[mattress protector|chux pad]] for the bed) because the diarrhea can occur swiftly and without much warning.

===Small intestine bacterial overgrowth===
Lactulose is used as a test of [[small intestine bacterial overgrowth syndrome|small intestine bacterial overgrowth]] (SIBO). Recently the reliability of it for diagnosing SIBO has been seriously questioned.<ref name="pmid18371132">{{cite journal | author = Vanner S | title = The lactulose breath test for diagnosing SIBO in IBS patients: another nail in the coffin | journal = Am.

The test is positive if an increase in exhaled hydrogen occurs before that which would be expected by normal [[Gut flora|colonocyte]] digestion. An earlier result has been hypothesized to indicate digestion occurring within the small intestine. An alternate explanation for differences in results is the variance in small bowel transit time among tested subjects.<ref name="YuGut2011" />

===Special populations===
No evidence of harm to the baby has been found when used during [[pregnancy]].<ref name=AHFS2015/> It is generally regarded as safe during breastfeeding.<ref name=Jones2013/>

==Side effects==
Common side effects of lactulose are abdominal cramping, [[borborygmus]] and [[flatulence]]. In normal individuals, overdose is considered uncomfortable, but not life-threatening.<ref>{{cite web|title=Safety Data Sheet Lactulose|url=http://static.usp.org/pdf/EN/referenceStandards/msds/1356803.pdf|accessdate=3 December 2016|date=2015}}</ref> Uncommon side effects are [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]].  In sensitive individuals, such as the elderly or people with reduced [[kidney]] function, excess lactulose dosage can result in [[dehydration]] and electrolyte disturbances such as [[hypomagnesemia|low magnesium levels]].  Ingestion of lactulose does not cause a weight gain because it is nondigestible with no nutritional value. Although lactulose is less likely to cause [[dental caries]] than sucrose, as a sugar there is potential for this. This should be taken into consideration when taken by people with a high susceptibility to this condition.

==Mechanism of action==
It is a [[disaccharide]] (double-sugar) formed from one molecule each of the [[simple sugars]] ([[monosaccharide]]s) [[fructose]] and [[galactose]]. Lactulose is not normally present in raw milk but is a product of heat-processes:<ref>{{cite  journal |author1=M. Luzzana |author2=D. Agnellini |author3=P. Cremonesi |author4=G. Caramenti |author5=S.

Lactulose is not absorbed in the [[small intestine]] nor broken down by human enzymes, thus stays in the digestive bolus through most of its course, causing retention of water through [[osmosis]] leading to softer, easier to pass stool. It has a secondary laxative effect in the colon, where it is [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermented]] by the [[gut flora]], producing [[metabolites]] which have osmotic powers and [[peristalsis]]-stimulating effects (such as [[acetate]]), but also [[methane]] associated with [[flatulence]].

Lactulose is metabolized in the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] by [[bacterial flora]] to short-chain fatty acids, including [[lactic acid]] and [[acetic acid]]. These partially dissociate, acidifying the colonic contents (increasing the H<sup>+</sup> concentration in the gut).<ref name="pmid3570029"/> This favors the formation of the nonabsorbable {{chem|NH|4|+}} from NH<sub>3</sub>, trapping NH<sub>3</sub> in the colon and effectively reducing plasma NH<sub>3</sub> concentrations. Lactulose is therefore effective in treating hepatic encephalopathy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gluud|first=Lise Lotte|last2=Vilstrup|first2=Hendrik|last3=Morgan|first3=Marsha Y.|date=2016-04-18|title=Non-absorbable disaccharides versus placebo/no intervention and lactulose versus lactitol for the prevention and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in people with cirrhosis|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27089005|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=4|pages=CD003044|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003044.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=27089005|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908140003/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27089005|archivedate=2017-09-08|df=}}</ref> Specifically it is effective as secondary prevention of hepatic encephalopathy in people with cirrhosis.<ref name="pmid19501587">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sharma BC, Sharma P, Agrawal A, Sarin SK | title = Secondary prophylaxis of hepatic encephalopathy: an open-label randomized controlled trial of lactulose versus placebo | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 137 | issue = 3 | pages = 885–91, 891.e1 |date=September 2009 | pmid = 19501587 | doi = 10.1053/j.gastro.2009.05.056 }}</ref> Moreover, recent studies showed improved cognitive functions of in people with cirrhosis with minimal hepatic encephalopathy treated with lactulose.<ref name="pmid17326150">{{cite journal |vauthors=Prasad S, Dhiman RK, Duseja A, Chawla YK, Sharma A, Agarwal R | title = Lactulose improves cognitive functions and health-related quality of life in patients with cirrhosis who have minimal hepatic encephalopathy | journal = Hepatology | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 549–59 |date=March 2007 | pmid = 17326150 | doi = 10.1002/hep.21533 }}</ref>
