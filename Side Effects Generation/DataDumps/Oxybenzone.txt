'''Oxybenzone''' or '''[[benzophenone]]-3''' ([[trade name]]s '''Milestab 9''', '''Eusolex 4360''', '''Escalol 567''', '''KAHSCREEN BZ-3''') is an [[organic compound]].  It is a pale-yellow solid that is readily soluble in most organic solvents. Oxybenzone belongs to the class of aromatic [[ketones]] known as [[benzophenones]]. It is a component of many [[sunscreen]] lotions.

== Structure and electronic structure ==
Being a [[Conjugated system|conjugated]] molecule, oxybenzone absorbs at lower energies than many aromatic molecules.<ref name="Castro">{{cite journal |doi=10.3390/50300424 |title=UV Spectral Properties of Benzophenone.

At low temperatures, however, it is possible to observe both the [[phosphorescence]] and the triplet-triplet absorption spectrum. At 175 K the triplet lifetime is 24 ns. The short lifetime has been attributed to a fast intramolecular hydrogen transfer between the oxygen of the C=O and the OH.<ref name="Chrétien">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1751-1097.2009.00644.x |title=Reducing Adverse Effects from UV Sunscreens by Zeolite Encapsulation: Comparison of Oxybenzone in Solution and in Zeolites |year=2010 |last1=ChréTien |first1=Michelle N. |last2=Heafey |first2=Eve |last3=Scaiano |first3=Juan C. |journal=Photochemistry and Photobiology |volume=86 |pages=153–61 |pmid=19930122 |issue=1}}</ref>

== Production ==
Oxybenzone is produced by [[Friedel-Crafts reaction]] of [[benzoyl chloride]] with [[3-methoxyphenol]](3-hydroxyanisole).<ref name=toxnet>{{cite web|title=Hazardous Substances Data Bank|url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/r?dbs+hsdb:@term+@rn+@rel+131-57-7|work=2-HYDROXY-4-METHOXYBENZOPHENONE|publisher=National Library of Medicine (US), Division of Specialized Information Services|accessdate=9 March 2014}}</ref>

== Uses ==
Oxybenzone is used in plastics as an ultraviolet light absorber and stabilizer.<ref name="toxnet"/> It is used, along with other [[benzophenone]]s, in sunscreens, hair sprays, and cosmetics because they help prevent potential damage from sunlight exposure. It is also found, in concentrations up to 1%, in nail polishes.<ref name="toxnet"/> Oxybenzone can also be used as a photostabilizer for [[synthetic resins]].<ref name="toxnet"/> Benzophenones can leach from food packaging, and are widely used as photo-initiators to activate a chemical that dries ink faster.<ref>Koivikko, R; Pastorelli, S; Rodríguez-Bernaldo de Quirós, A; Paseiro-Cerrato, R; Paseiro-Losada, P; Simoneau, C (2010). “Rapid multi-analye quantification of benzophenone, 4-methylbenzophenone and related derivatives form paperboard food packaging”.

As a sunscreen, it provides broad-spectrum ultraviolet coverage, including [[Ultraviolet#Subtypes|UVB]] and short-wave [[Ultraviolet#Subtypes|UVA]] rays. As a [[photoprotection|photoprotective]] agent, it has an [[absorption spectrum|absorption]] profile spanning from 270 to 350&nbsp;nm with absorption peaks at 288 and 350&nbsp;nm.<ref name="Burnett, M.

E 2011"/> It is also found in nail polish, fragrances, hairspray, and cosmetics as a photostabilizer. Despite its photoprotective qualities, much controversy surrounds oxybenzone because of its possible hormonal and photoallergenic effects, leading many countries to regulate its use.

== Safety and controversy ==
Some debate focuses on the potential of oxybenzone as an [[endocrine disruptor]].<ref name="Burnett, M. E 2011"/ Due to the advent of [[4-Aminobenzoic acid|PABA]]-free sunscreens, oxybenzone is now the most common allergen found in sunscreens.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rietschel|first1=Robert L.|last2=Fowler|first2=Joseph F.|title=Fisher's Contact Dermatitis|date=2008|publisher=PMPH-USA|location=Hamilton|isbn=9781550093780|page=460|edition=6th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dQBAzfyCeQ8C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=8 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=DeLeo|first1=Vincent A.|last2=Suarez|first2=Sylvia M.|last3=Maso|first3=Martha J.|title=Photoallergic contact dermatitis; results of photo patch testing in New York, 1985-1990|journal=Arch Dermatol|date=1992|volume=128|issue=11|pages=1513–1518|url=http://archderm.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=554533|accessdate=8 February 2015|doi=10.1001/archderm.1992.01680210091015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Scheuer|first1=Elyse|last2=Warshaw|first2=Erin|title=Sunscreen Allergy: A Review of Epidemiology, Clinical Characteristics, and Responsible Allergens|journal=Dermatitis|date=March 2006|volume=17|issue=1|pages=3–11|doi=10.2310/6620.2006.05017|url=http://journals.lww.com/dermatitis/Abstract/2006/03000/Sunscreen_Allergy__A_Review_of_Epidemiology,.2.aspx|accessdate=8 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Xiao-Min|last2=Nakagawa|first2=Mikio|last3=Kawai|first3=Keiichi|last4=Kawai|first4=Kyozo|title=Erythema-multiforme-like eruption following photoallergic contact dermatitis from oxybenzone|journal=Contact Dermatitis|date=January 1998|volume=38|issue=1|pages=43–44|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0536.1998.tb05637.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0536.1998.tb05637.x/abstract|accessdate=8 February 2015}}</ref>

=== Sweden ===
The [[Swedish Research Council]] has determined that sunscreens with oxybenzone are unsuitable for use in young children, because children under the age of two years have not fully developed the enzymes that are believed break it down. No regulations have come of this study yet.<ref name="toxnet"/>
