<!-- Definition and medical uses -->
'''Amiloride''', sold under the trade name '''Midamor''' among others, is a medication typically used with other medications to treat [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] or [[edema|swelling]] due to [[heart failure]] or [[cirrhosis|cirrhosis of the liver]].<ref name=AHFS2016/><ref name=WHO2008>{{cite book|title=WHO Model Formulary 2008|date=2009|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=9789241547659|pages=328, 330|url=http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/documents/s16879e/s16879e.pdf|accessdate= 8 December 2016}}</ref> Amiloride is often used with a [[thiazide]] or other [[loop diuretic]].<ref name=WHO2008/> It is taken by mouth.<ref name=AHFS2016/> Onset of action is about two hours and it lasts for about a day.<ref name=WHO2008/>

<!-- Side effects and mechanism -->

==Contraindications==
Amiloride is contraindicated in people with [[Addison's disease]], [[hyperkalaemia]], [[hyponatremia]] and [[anuria]].<ref name="ReferenceA">E-Facts and Comparisons: Amiloride Adverse effects 2016</ref>

==Structure==
Amiloride's chemical structure contains a [[guanidine|guanidinium]] group containing [[pyrazine]] derivative.

==Mechanism of action==
Amiloride works by directly blocking the [[epithelial sodium channel]] (ENaC) thereby inhibiting [[sodium]] reabsorption in the late [[distal convoluted tubule]]s, connecting tubules, and collecting ducts in the [[nephron]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Loffing, Johannes  |author2=Kaissling, Brigitte | title = Sodium and calcium transport pathways along the mammalian distal nephron: from rabbit to human | journal = Am J Physiol Renal Physiol | pages = F628–F643| year = 2003 | pmid = 12620920 | volume = 284 | doi=10.1152/ajprenal.00217.2002 | issue=4}}</ref> This promotes the loss of sodium and water from the body, but without depleting [[potassium]]. The drug is often used in conjunction with a [[thiazide]] diuretic to counteract the potassium-sparing effect. Due to its potassium-sparing capacities, [[hyperkalemia]] can occur. The risk of developing hyperkalemia is increased in patients who are also on [[ACE inhibitor]]s, [[angiotensin II receptor antagonist]]s, other [[potassium-sparing diuretics]], or any potassium-containing supplements.

A fraction of the effects of amiloride is inhibition of [[cyclic GMP-gated cation channel]]s in the [[inner medullary collecting duct]].<ref name=boron875>{{cite book |author =Walter F. Boron |title=Medical Physiology: A Cellular And Molecular Approaoch |publisher=Elsevier/Saunders |location= |year= |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2328-3 |oclc= |doi=}} page 875</ref>

Amiloride has a second action on the heart, blocking Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchangers [[sodium–hydrogen antiporter 1]] or NHE-1. This minimizes re-perfusion injury in ischemic attacks.

Amiloride also blocks the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter on the apical surface of the [[proximal tubule]] cells, in the nephron, abolishing more than 80% of the action of [[angiotensin II]] on the secretion of hydrogen ions in proximal tubule cells.<ref>M G Cogan, Angiotensin II: a powerful controller of sodium transport in the early proximal tubule, Hypertension. 1990;15:451-458, {{doi|10.1161/01.HYP.15.5.451}}, http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/15/5/451<br>
</ref>

Amiloride was also tested as treatment of [[cystic fibrosis]], but it was revealed inefficient in vivo due to its short time of action, therefore longer-acting [[epithelial sodium channel]] (ENaC) inhibitors may prove more effective, e.g. [[benzamil]].<ref>(Review)Pharmacological treatment of the biochemical defect in cystic fibrosis airways, H.C. Rodgers, A.J. Knoxhttp://erj.ersjournals.com/content/17/6/1314.full.pdf+html</ref>

[[Acid-sensing ion channel]]s (ASICs) are also sensitive to inhibition by amiloride. ASICs are involved in [[nociceptor]] responses to pH.<ref>Hunt and Koltzenburg 2005 'The neurobiology of pain'</ref>

==Society and culture==
It is on the [[World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines]], the most important medications needed in a basic [[health system]].<ref name=WHO19th/>

Amiloride is listed on the world anti-doping agency's list of banned substances, it is considered a [[masking agent]].<ref>{{cite web|title=S5. Diuretics and masking agents - WADA|url=http://list.wada-ama.org/list/s5-diuretics-and-other-masking-agents/|work=World Anti-Doping Agency|accessdate=1 September 2016|date=January 2016}}</ref>
