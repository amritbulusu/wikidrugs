'''Pertuzumab''' (also called '''2C4''', trade name '''Perjeta''')<ref name=Adis>{{cite web|title=Pertuzumab|url=http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800014629|publisher=AdisInsight|accessdate=2 November 2016}}</ref> is a [[monoclonal antibody]] used in combination with [[trastuzumab]] and [[docetaxel]] for the treatment of metastatic [[HER2]]-positive [[breast cancer]]; it also used in the same combination as a [[neoadjuvant]] in early HER2-positive breast cancer.<ref name=USlabel2016/>

Side effects in more than half the people taking it include diarrhea, hair loss, and [[neutropenia|loss of neutrophils]]; more than 10% experience [[anemia|loss of red blood cells]], hypersensitivity or allergic reaction, infusion reactions, decreased appetite, insomnia, distortions in the sense of taste, inflammation of the mouth or lips, constipation, rashes, [[nail disease]], and muscle pain.<ref name=UKlabel2015/>  Women who are pregnant or planning on getting pregnant should not take it, it was not studied in people with certain heart conditions and should be used in caution in such people, and it should not be used with an [[anthracycline]].<ref name=UKlabel2015/>  It is unknown if pertuzumab interacts with [[doxorubicin]].<ref name=UKlabel2015/>

It is the first-in-class of a kind of drug called a "[[Epidermal growth factor receptor|HER]] dimerization inhibitor" — it inhibits the [[protein dimer|dimer]]ization of HER2 with other HER receptors, which prevents them from [[HER2/neu#Signal transduction|signalling]] in ways that promote cell growth and proliferation.<ref name=Harbeck2013rev/>

It was discovered and developed by [[Genentech]], a subsidiary of [[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche]], and was first approved in 2012.<ref name=Adis/><ref name=FDA2012/>

==Medical uses==
Pertuzumab is administered as an intravenous infusion in combination with [[trastuzumab]] and [[docetaxel]] as a first line treatment for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.<ref name=USlabel2016>{{cite web|title=Perjeta Label|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2016/125409s109lbl.pdf|publisher=FDA|accessdate=2 November 2016|date=March 2016}}</ref><ref name=UKlabel2015>{{cite web|title=UK Perjeta Label|url=https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/27473|publisher=Electronic Medicines Compendium|accessdate=2 November 2016|date=18 September 2015}}</ref>  It is also used in the same combination as a [[neoadjuvant]] (given to reduce the size of a tumor, prior to surgery or radiation) for HER2-positive early breast cancer; as of 2016 this use had not been shown to increase survival.<ref name=USlabel2016/>

As of 2016 pertuzumab had not been studied in people with a [[left ventricular ejection fraction]] value of ≤ 50% normal, a prior history of congestive heart failure, or conditions that could impair [[left ventricle|left ventricular]] function like uncontrolled hypertension, recent heart attacks, or serious cardiac arrhythmia.<ref name=UKlabel2015/>  Caution should be used combining pertuzumab with an [[anthracycline]].<ref name=UKlabel2015/>  There is also no safety data available for use of pertuzumab in combination with [[doxorubicin]].<ref name=UKlabel2015/>

Women of child-bearing age should use contraception while taking pertuzumab; it may damage the fetus in pregnant women, and it may be secreted in breast milk.<ref name=UKlabel2015/>

==Adverse effects==
In clinical trials of the three-agent combination therapy in metastatic breast cancer, adverse effects occurring in more than half the people taking it included diarrhea, hair loss, and [[neutropenia|loss of neutrophils]]; more than 10% of people experienced loss of neutrophils with fever, and [[leucopenia|loss of leukocytes]].<ref name=UKlabel2015/>  After docetaxel was dropped in some people, the most common adverse effects were diarrhea (28.1%), upper respiratory tract infection (18.3%), rash (18.3%), headache (17.0%), fatigue (13.4%), swelling of nasal passages and throat (often due to catching the common cold) (17.0%), weakness (13.4%), itchiness (13.7%), joint pain (11.4%), nausea (12.7%), pain in an extremity (13.4%), back pain (12.1%) and cough (12.1%).<ref name=UKlabel2015/>

In clinical trials of the neoadjuvant use of the combination, more than 50% of people had hair loss and [[neutropenia|loss of neutrophils]].<ref name=UKlabel2015/>

In both uses, more than 10% of people additionally experienced: [[anemia|loss of red blood cells]], hypersensitivity or allergic reaction, infusion reactions, decreased appetite, insomnia, distortions in the sense of taste, inflammation of the mouth or lips, constipation, rashes, [[nail disease]], and muscle pain.<ref name=UKlabel2015/>

==Pharmacology==
The metabolism of pertuzumab has not been directly studied; in general antibodies are cleared principally by [[catabolism]].  The median clearance of pertuzumab was 0.235 liters/day and the median half-life was 18 days.<ref name=UKlabel2015/>

==Mechanism of action==
[[HER2/neu|HER2]] is an extracellular receptor—a [[receptor tyrosine kinase]] - that when activated, sets off [[signal transduction]] through [[HER2/neu#Signal transduction|several pathways]] that stimulate cell proliferation and cell growth; if overexpressed it can cause uncontrollable growth. HER2 positive breast cancer is caused by mutation that results in overexpression of HER2 in approximately 15-30% of breast cancer tumors.<ref name=HER2rev2012>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mitri Z, Constantine T, O'Regan R | title = The HER2 Receptor in Breast Cancer: Pathophysiology, Clinical Use, and New Advances in Therapy | journal = Chemotherapy Research and Practice | volume = 2012 | issue =  | pages = 743193 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23320171 | pmc = 3539433 | doi = 10.1155/2012/743193 }}</ref>

Like many receptors HER2 normally combines another protein in order to function (a process called [[Protein dimer|dimerization]]); it can bind with a second HER2 receptor (acting as a [[homodimer]]) and it can heterodimerize with a different receptor of the [[Epidermal growth factor receptor|HER family]]. The most potent dimer for activating signalling pathways is HER2/HER3.<ref name=Harbeck2013rev/>

The [[epitope]] for pertuzumab is the domain of HER2 where it binds to HER3, and pertuzumab prevents the HER2/HER3 dimer from forming, which blocks signalling by the dimer.<ref name=Harbeck2013rev/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Badache|first1=A|last2=Hynes|first2=NE|title=A new therapeutic antibody masks ErbB2 to its partners.|journal=Cancer Cell|date=April 2004|volume=5|issue=4|pages=299–301|pmid=15093533|url=http://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/pdf/S1535-6108(04)00088-1.pdf|doi=10.1016/s1535-6108(04)00088-1}}</ref>  [[Trastuzumab]] is another monoclonal antibody against HER2; its epitope is the domain where HER2 binds to another HER2 protein.<ref name=Harbeck2013rev>{{cite journal|last1=Harbeck|first1=N, et al.|title=HER2 Dimerization Inhibitor Pertuzumab - Mode of Action and Clinical Data in Breast Cancer.|journal=Breast care (Basel, Switzerland)|date=March 2013|volume=8|issue=1|pages=49–55|pmid=24715843|pmc=3971793|doi=10.1159/000346837}}</ref>  The two mAbs together prevent HER2 from functioning.<ref name=Harbeck2013rev/>

==Chemistry and manufacturing ==
Pertuzumab is an immunoglobulin G1 with a variable region against the human HER2 protein, a human-mouse monoclonal 2C4 heavy chain, disulfide bound with a human-mouse monoclonal 2C4 κ-chain.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Proposed INN: List 89|journal=WHO Drug Information|date=2003|volume=17|issue=3|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/druginformation/innlists/PL89.pdf}}</ref>

It is manufactured recombinantly in [[Chinese hamster ovary|CHO]] cells.<ref name=USlabel2016/>

==History==
The monoclonal antibody 2C4 appears to have first been published in 1990 by scientists from Genentech,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fendly|first1=BM, et al|title=Characterization of murine monoclonal antibodies reactive to either the human epidermal growth factor receptor or HER2/neu gene product.|journal=Cancer Research|date=1 March 1990|volume=50|issue=5|pages=1550–8|pmid=1689212|url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/50/5/1550.full.pdf}}, referenced in {{cite journal|last1=Molina|first1=MA, et al.|title=Trastuzumab (herceptin), a humanized anti-Her2 receptor monoclonal antibody, inhibits basal and activated Her2 ectodomain cleavage in breast cancer cells.|journal=Cancer Research|date=15 June 2001|volume=61|issue=12|pages=4744–9|pmid=11406546|url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/61/12/4744.full.pdf}}</ref> the same year that [[Hoffmann-La Roche|F.

By 2003 Genentech understood that 2C4 prevented HER2 dimerizing with other HER receptors and had begun Phase I trials, aiming for a broad range of cancers, not just ones overexpressing HER2.  It was the first known HER dimerization inhibitor.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Albanell|first1=J|last2=Codony|first2=J|last3=Rovira|first3=A|last4=Mellado|first4=B|last5=Gascón|first5=P|title=Mechanism of action of anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies: scientific update on trastuzumab and 2C4.|journal=Advances in experimental medicine and biology|date=2003|volume=532|pages=253–68|pmid=12908564|doi=10.1007/978-1-4615-0081-0_21}}</ref>

In 2005 Genentech presented poor results of Phase II trials of pertuzumab as a single agent in prostate, breast, and ovarian cancers, and said that it intended to continue developing it in combination with other drugs for ovarian cancer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Press Release: Data From Omnitarg Clinical Program Presented at American Society of Clinical Oncology Meeting|url=https://www.gene.com/media/press-releases/8431/2005-05-15/data-from-omnitarg-clinical-program-pres|publisher=Genentech|date=May 15, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Genentech's Omnitarg fails in Phase II|url=http://www.pharmatimes.com/news/genentechs_omnitarg_fails_in_phase_ii_998265|work=Pharma Times|date=16 May 2005|language=en}}</ref>

In 2007 Genentech dropped the trade name Omnitarg.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Correction: Letter from the Editor|journal=Cancer Oncology News|date=February 2012|page=3|url=https://issuu.com/mcmahongroup/docs/con0212_de/3}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Press release: Roche in the first half of 2007|url=http://www.roche.com/investors/updates/inv-update-2007-07-19.htm|publisher=Roche|date=19 July 2007}}</ref>

Pertuzumab was approved in Europe in 2013.<ref name=UKlabel2015/>

Pertuzumab had also been studied in [[Non-small cell lung cancer]] but as of 2016 that indication had been discontinued.<ref name=Adis/>

==Society and culture==
As of 2016, in the US each cycle of the 3-drug combination given every 3 weeks costs around $8,500, not including ancillary care costs.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Durkee|first1=BY, et a;.|last10=Horst|title=Cost-Effectiveness of Pertuzumab in Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer.|journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology|date=20 March 2016|volume=34|issue=9|pages=902–9|pmid=26351332|url=http://ascopubs.org/doi/pdf/10.1200/JCO.2015.62.9105|doi=10.1200/jco.2015.62.9105|pmc=5070553}}</ref>

In the UK, a [[NICE]] evaluation in 2015 made a preliminary finding that the drug combination was not cost effective, and NICE rejected the drug in the neoadjuvant setting in May 2016, primarily because it was unknown if the drug combination provided a survival benefit.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fleeman|first1=N|last2=Bagust|first2=A|last3=Beale|first3=S|last4=Dwan|first4=K|last5=Dickson|first5=R|last6=Proudlove|first6=C|last7=Dundar|first7=Y|title=Pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel for the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic or locally recurrent unresectable breast cancer.|journal=PharmacoEconomics|date=January 2015|volume=33|issue=1|pages=13–23|pmid=25138171|doi=10.1007/s40273-014-0206-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Breast cancer (HER2 positive,  metastatic) - pertuzumab (with trastuzumab and docetaxel) [ID523]|url=https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/indevelopment/gid-tag322|publisher=NICE|accessdate=2 November 2016|date=1 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=McKee|first1=Selina|title=NICE rejects Roche’s breast cancer drug Perjeta|url=http://www.pharmatimes.com/news/nice_rejects_roches_breast_cancer_drug_perjeta_1026018|work=Pharma Times|date=20 May 2016|language=en}}</ref> This decision was subsequently reversed six months later and pertuzumab became the first new breast cancer drug to be approved by NICE for routine [[NHS]] funding in almost a decade
