'''Dornase alfa''' (proprietary name '''Pulmozyme''' from [[Genentech]]) is a highly purified solution of recombinant human [[deoxyribonuclease I]] (rhDNase), an [[enzyme]] which selectively cleaves [[DNA]].   Dornase alfa hydrolyzes the DNA present in sputum/mucus of [[cystic fibrosis]] patients and reduces [[viscosity]] in the lungs, promoting improved clearance of secretions.  This protein therapeutic agent is produced in [[Chinese hamster ovary]] cells.

== Cystic fibrosis ==
Dornase alfa is the most recent therapeutic agent developed with this basic mechanism of action.  Prior to the cloning of the human enzyme, [[cow|bovine]] DNase I was on the market for many years, though its utility was limited by the inherent [[antigenic]] response to a cow protein in the lungs of patients.  Other DNases, such as [[deoxyribonuclease II|DNase II]], have therapeutic potential as well, but no further DNases have been brought to market yet for cystic fibrosis.

Dornase alfa is an [[orphan drug]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Collier|first=Joe|title=Dornase-alfa and orphan drugs|journal=The Lancet|date=1 September 1995|volume=346|issue=8975|pages=633|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(95)91460-9}}</ref>

== Contraindications ==
* Hypersensitivity to dornase alfa
* Hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products
