==Therapeutic uses==

===Premature ejaculation===
Randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trials have confirmed the efficacy of dapoxetine for the treatment of PE.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McMahon | first1 = C.

With no drug approved specifically for treatment for PE in the US and some other countries, other SSRIs such as [[fluoxetine]], [[paroxetine]], [[sertraline]], [[fluvoxamine]], and [[citalopram]] have been used off-label to treat PE. Waldinger's meta-analysis shows that the use of these conventional antidepressants increases IELT two- to nine-fold above baseline, compared to three- to eight-fold when dapoxetine is used.<ref name="Pryor"/> However, these SSRIs must be taken daily in order to achieve meaningful efficacy, and the long half-life increases the risk of drug accumulation and as a consequence increase of adverse effects such as reduced libido and erectile dysfunction.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Montague | first1 = D.

==Contraindications==
A [[contraindication]] is a situation in which a drug should not be used, because it may be harmful to the patient.<ref>Contraindications. (2012) Retrieved 11/27, 2012, from http://www.drugs.com/enc/contraindications.html</ref>
Dapoxetine should not be used in men with moderate to severe hepatic impairment and in those receiving CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, ritonavir, and telithromycine. Dapoxetine can also not be used in patients with heart failure, permanent pacemaker, or other significant ischemic heart disease. Caution is advised in men receiving [[thioridazine]], [[monoamine oxidase inhibitors]], SSRIs, [[serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors]], or [[tricyclic antidepressant]]. If a patient stops taking one of these drugs, he should wait for 14 days before taking dapoxetine. If a patient stops taking dapoxetine, he should wait for 7 days before receiving these drugs.<ref name ="Government"/>

==Adverse effects==
The most common effects when taking dapoxetine are nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, headache, diarrhea, and [[insomnia]].<ref name="Buvat">{{cite journal | last1 = Buvat | first1 = J. | last2 = Tesfaye | first2 = F. | last3 = Rothman | first3 = M. | last4 = Rivas | first4 = D.

===Interactions===
* With [[phosphodiesterase inhibitors]] (PDE5 inhibitors)
Many men that have PE also suffer from [[erectile dysfunction]] (ED). Treatment for these patients should consider the drug–drug interaction between dapoxetine and PDE5 inhibitors such as [[tadalafil]] (Cialis) or [[sildenafil]] (Viagra). In Dresser study (2006), plasma concentration of 24 subjects was obtained. Half of the sample pool were treated with dapoxetine 60&nbsp;mg + tadalafil 20&nbsp;mg; the other half were treated with dapoxetine 60&nbsp;mg + sildenafil 100&nbsp;mg. These plasma samples were then analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that dapoxetine does not alter the pharmacokinetic of tadalafil or sildenafil.<ref name="Dresser"/>
* With [[Ethanol|ethano]]l
Ethanol doesn't affect the pharmacokinetics of dapoxetine when taking concurrently.<ref name="Modi">{{cite journal | last1 = Modi | first1 = N.

==Mechanism of actions==
The mechanism through which dapoxetine affects premature ejaculation is still unclear.  However, it is presumed that dapoxetine works by inhibiting [[serotonin transporter]] and subsequently increasing serotonin's action at pre and postsynaptic receptors<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gengo | first1 = P.

The Central Mechanisms of Sexual Function Retrieved 11/11/12, 2012, from http://www.bumc.bu.edu/sexualmedicine/publications/the-central-mechanisms-of-sexual-function/</ref> The ejaculatory pathway originates from spinal reflex at the thoracolumbar and lumbosacral level of spinal cord activated by stimuli from male genital. These signals are relayed to the [[brain stem]], which then is influenced by a number of nuclei in the brain such as medial preoptic and paraventricular nulcei.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Giuliano | first1 = F. | last2 = Clement | first2 = P. | year = 2005 | title = Physiology of ejaculation: emphasis on serotonergic control.

However, it is unclear whether dapoxetine acts directly on LPGi or on the descending pathway in which LPGi located.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Clement | first1 = P. | last2 = Bernabe | first2 = J. | last3 = Gengo | first3 = P. | last4 = Denys | first4 = P. | last5 = Laurin | first5 = M. | last6 = Alexandre | first6 = L. | last7 = Giuliano | first7 = F. | year = 2007 | title = Supraspinal site of action for the inhibition of ejaculatory reflex by dapoxetine | url = | journal = European Urology | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 825–832 | doi = 10.1016/J.Eururo.2006.10.011 }}</ref>

==Pharmacokinetics==
;Absorption
Dapoxetine is a white powder substance and water- insoluble. Taken 1–3 hours before sexual activity, it is rapidly absorbed in the body. Its [[Cmax (pharmacology)|maximum plasma concentration]] (C<sub>max</sub>) is reached 1–2 hours after oral administration. The C<sub>max</sub> and [[Area under the curve (pharmacokinetics)|AUC]] (Area Under the plasma vs. time Curve) are dose dependent. The C<sub>max</sub> and Tm (time needed to obtain the maximum plasma concentration) after single doses of dapoxetine 30&nbsp;mg and 60&nbsp;mg are 297 and 498&nbsp;ng/mL at 1.01 and 1.27 hours respectively.
A high fat meal does reduce the C<sub>max</sub> slightly, but it is insignificant. In fact, food doesn't alter dapoxetine pharmacokinetics. Dapoxetine can be taken with or without food.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McMahon | first1 = C. G. | last2 = Althof | first2 = S. E. | last3 = Kaufman | first3 = J.

;Distribution
Dapoxetine is absorbed and distributed rapidly in the body. Greater than 99% of dapoxetine is bound to the plasma protein. The mean steady state volume is 162 L. Its initial half-life is 1.31 hours (30&nbsp;mg dose) and 1.42 hours (60&nbsp;mg dose,) and its terminal half life is 18.7 hours (30&nbsp;mg dose) and 21.9 hours (60&nbsp;mg dose).<ref>Dapoxetine: a guide to its use in premature ejaculation (D. T. Perspective, Trans.). (2011) (Vol. 27, pp. 1-4).</ref>
;Metabolism
Dapoxetine is [[metabolized]] extensively in the liver and kidney by multiple [[enzymes]] such as CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and flavin monooxygenase 1 (FMO1). The major product at the end of the metabolic pathway is circulating dapoxetine N-oxide, which is a weak SSRI and contributes no clinical effect. The other products presented less than 3% in the plasma are desmethyldapoxetine and didesmethydapoxetine. Desmethyldapoxetine is approximately equipotent to dapoxetine.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dresser | first1 = M. | last2 = Lindert | first2 = K. | last3 = Lin | first3 = D. | last4 = Gidwani | first4 = S. | last5 = Gupta | first5 = S.

;Excretion
The [[metabolites]] of dapoxetine are eliminated rapidly in the urine with a terminal half-life of 18.7 and 21.9 hours for a single dose of 30&nbsp;mg and 60&nbsp;mg respectively.<ref name ="Modi"/>

==Safety and tolerability==
;Cardiovascular safety
The cardiovascular safety profile of dapoxetine has been studied extensively during the drug development. Phase I trials showed that dapoxetine had neither clinical significant electrocardiographic effects nor delayed repolarization effects, with dosing up to four-fold greater than the maximum recommended dosage which is 60&nbsp;mg. Phase III studies in men with PE showed a safety and well tolerate profile of dapoxetine with dosing of 30 and 60&nbsp;mg. There is no cardiovascular adverse had been found.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kowey | first1 = P. R. | last2 = Mudumbi | first2 = R. V. | last3 = Aquilina | first3 = J.

;Neurocognitive safety
Studies of SSRIs in patients with major [[psychiatric disorders]] prove that SSRIs are potentially associated with certain neurocognitive adverse effects such as [[anxiety]], [[akathisia]], [[hypomania]], changes in mood, or suicidal thought.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Khan | first1 = A. | last2 = Khan | first2 = S. | last3 = Kolts | first3 = R. | last4 = Brown | first4 = W.

==Synthesis==
[[File:Dapoxetine synthesis.svg|thumb|center|525px|none|frame|Synthesis of dapoxetine]]
Currently very few methods are used to synthesize (''S'')-dapoxetine. This novel approach consists of only six steps in which three main steps are shown above. The initial reactant is ''trans''-cinnamyl alcohol which is commercial available. [[Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation]] and [[Mitsunobu reaction]] have been used to produce expected (''S'')-dapoxetine. The overall yield is 35%. This method is considered a good choice compare to the known methods due to high yield and easily obtainable reactants.<ref>Venkatesan, K., & Srinivasan, K. V. (2008). A stereoselective synthesis of (''S'')-dapoxetine starting from ''trans''-cinnamyl alcohol. arkivoc, 16, 9.</ref>

==Regulatory history==
Dapoxetine was created by Eli Lilly and in phase I clinical trial as an antidepressant. However, It never worked out well as a medication for the treatment of depression and was shelved for a while before subsequently developed to treat PE. In December 2003, Eli Lilly sold patent of dapoxetine to [[Pharmaceutical Product Development]](PPD) for 65 million US dollars in cash. Eli Lilly may also receive royalties payment from PPD if the sale exceeds certain amount.

ALZA is the current owner of dapoxetine. However, PPD will receive milestone payment and drug royalties from ALZA. If approved, dapoxetine will be marketed in the US by Ortho McNeil pharmaceutical, Inc. Ortho McNeil as well as Janssen-Ortho Inc, or Janssen-Cilag are all units of Johnson & Johnson.
Dapoxetine is currently in phase III clinical trials, pending review by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA).<ref>Dapoxetine: LY 210448. (2005). [Review]. ''Drugs R D'', 6(5), 307-311.</ref>

Dapoxetine has been marketed and approved in more than 50 countries.<ref>Priligy for Premature Ejaculation: Partnership with Menarini. (2012)  Retrieved 11/17, 2012, from http://www.furiex.com/pipeline/marketed-products/priligy/</ref> Dapoxetine has been approved in Italy, Spain, Mexico, South Korea, and New Zealand in 2009 and 2010; marketed in Sweden, Austria, Germany, Finland, Spain, Portugal, and Italy.
