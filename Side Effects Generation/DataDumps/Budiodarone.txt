'''Budiodarone''' ('''ATI-2042''') is an [[antiarrhythmic agent]] and chemical analog of [[amiodarone]] that is currently being studied in [[clinical trials]]. Amiodarone is considered the most effective antiarrhythmic drug available,<ref>Roy, D. et al. Amiodarone to prevent recurrence of atrial fibrillation. N Engl J Med. 2000;342:913-920</ref><ref>Singh, B.N., et al. Amiodarone versus sotalol for atrial fibrillation. N Engl J Med. 2005;352:1861-1872</ref><ref>Kochiadakis, G.E., et al. Low dose amiodarone and sotalol in the treatment of recurrent, symptomatic atrial fibrillation: a comparative, placebo controlled study. Heart. 2000;84:251-257</ref> but its adverse side effects, including hepatic, pulmonary and thyroid toxicity as well as multiple drug interactions,<ref name="Morey">Morey, T.E. et al. Structure-activity relationships and electrophysiological effects of short-acting amiodarone homologs in guinea pig isolated heart. J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2001;297:260-266</ref> are discouraging its use. Budiodarone only differs in structure from amiodarone through the presence of a [[sec-Butyl acetate|''sec''-butyl acetate]] side chain at position 2 of the [[benzofuran]] moiety.<ref>Mason, P.K., DiMarco, P. Advances in Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology. Circulation. 2009;2:588-597</ref> This side chain allows for budiodarone to have a shorter [[half-life]] in the body than amiodarone (7 hours versus 35–68 days) which allows it to have a faster onset of action and metabolism while still maintaining similar electrophysiological activity.<ref name="Morey" /> The faster metabolism of budiodarone allows for fewer adverse side effects than amiodarone principally due to decreased levels of toxicity in the body.

==Creation of arrythmias==
[[Arrhythmias]] may be caused by changes in ion channel mRNA and protein expression which modify [[action potential]] generation through dysfunctional channels and increase the likelihood of inappropriate electrical re-entry (electrical stimulus entering back into the cell to prematurely start the next action potential).<ref>Bosch, R.F., Nattel, S. Cellular electrophysiology of atrial fibrillation. Cardiovasc Res. 2002;54:259-269</ref> The increase in electrical re-entry causes the [[fibrillation]] or uncontrolled action potential discord of [[atrial myocytes]]. Arrhythmias have historically been treated using atrial [[ablation]] or antiarrhythmic drugs to decrease electrical re-entry and therefore fibrillation.

==Treatment of arrhythmias==
Budiodarone holds much promise as an antiarrhythmic drug to prevent fibrillation. As a drug that spans over many of antiarrhythmic drug classes, the electrophysiological activity of budiodarone includes:<ref name="Morey" />

===Inhibition of potassium, sodium and calcium channels===
Through inhibiting potassium channels, budiodarone causes a decreased efflux of potassium out of the myocyte during the [[refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]] of its action potential, increasing the time it takes to reach the resting [[membrane potential]].

Through blocking sodium channels, budiodarone causes a decrease in sodium influx into myocytes during the [[depolarization]] period of its action potential.

Through blocking calcium channels, budiodarone causes a decrease in calcium influx into myocytes, decreasing intracellular calcium and decreasing cardiac [[contractility]], which is beneficial in preventing arrhythmias, but detrimental in ventricular contraction.

===Increase in atrial myocyte refractory period===
Through prolonging the refractory and depolarization periods of the action potential, there is a decreased likelihood that electrical re-entry will occur.

===Increased stimulus-to-atrium and atrium-to-bundle of his intervals===
Increasing the time interval between stimulus to atrium and/or atrium to [[bundle of his]] in action potential conduction slows the rate of myocyte contraction, thereby slowing heart rate.

===Increased MAPD90 and QT-intervals===
Increasing the time interval of MAPD90 (response of monophasic action potential duration at 90% repolarization) and/or [[QT interval|QT]] in action potential conduction slows the rate of myocyte contraction, thereby slowing heart rate.

===Dose-dependent decrease in heart rate===
A decrease in heart rate reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation.

==Clinical trials==
Preliminary trials of budiodarone have administered the drug orally as a tartrate salt in amounts ranging from 200–800&nbsp;mg bid.<ref name="Arya">Arya, A. et al. A preliminary assessment of the effects of AT1-2042 in subjects with paroxysomal atrial fibrillation using implanted pacemaker methodology. Europace. 2009;11:458-464</ref><ref name="Ezekowitz">Ezekowitz, M. et al. PASCAL: a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study of budiodarone (AT1-2042) in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and pacemakers with atrial fibrillation data logging capabilities [abstract]. Presented at Heart Rhythm Society Annual Scientific Sessions, Boston, Massachusetts, May 2009</ref> Evidence has shown that 400–600&nbsp;mg [[bis in die|bid]] doses were associated with the highest reduction in atrial fibrillation burden (54.4% and 75% respectively)<ref name="Ezekowitz" /> while remaining free of the adverse side effects common with amiodarone.<ref name="Arya" />

There has also been evidence of prolonged budiodarone cardiac effect days after drug discontinuation as the atrial fibrillation baseline measurements were not reached in [[washout]] periods.<ref name="Arya" /> This suggests that budiodarone may promote atrial re-modelling to improve malfunctioning ion channels that once potentiated fibrillation.

==Future use==
Data on the effects of long-term budiodarone are not yet available. The completion of current clinical trials will examine chronic budiodarone use to confirm or deny its use as an effective and safe antiarrhythmic drug.
