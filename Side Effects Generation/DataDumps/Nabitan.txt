'''Nabitan''' ('''Nabutam''', '''Benzopyranoperidine''', '''SP-106''', '''Abbott 40656''') is a [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] [[cannabinoid]] [[Analog (chemistry)|analog]] of [[dronabinol]] (Marinol).<ref>Razdan RK. The Total Synthesis of Cannabinoids. Wiley-Interscience 1980</ref> It exhibits [[antiemetic]] and [[analgesic]] effects, most likely by binding to and activating the CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub> [[cannabinoid receptor]]s, and reduced [[intraocular pressure]] in animal tests, making it potentially useful in the treatment of [[glaucoma]].<ref>Razdan RK, Howes JF. "Drugs related to tetrahydrocannabinol." ''Medicinal Research Reviews'' 1983; 3(2):119-146. {{PMID|6134882}}</ref>

Nabitan has the advantage of being water-soluble, unlike most cannabinoid derivatives, and was researched for potential use as an analgesic or [[sedative]],<ref>Archer RA. "The cannabinoids: therapeutic potentials." ''Annual Reports in Medicinal Chemistry'' 1974; 9: 253-259. {{PMID|12307093}}</ref> although it was never developed for clinical use and is not currently used in medicine, as [[dronabinol]] or [[nabilone]] were felt to be more useful. However it is sometimes used in research into the potential therapeutic applications of cannabinoids.
