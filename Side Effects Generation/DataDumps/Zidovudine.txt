===HIV treatment===
AZT is usually dosed twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral therapies. This approach is referred to as  Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) and is used to prevent the likelihood of HIV resistance.<ref>{{cite journal | author=De Clercq E | title=HIV resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors | journal=Biochem Pharmacol | volume=47 | issue=2 | pages=155–69 | year=1994 | pmid=7508227 | doi=10.1016/0006-2952(94)90001-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yarchoan R, Mitsuya H, Broder S | title=AIDS therapies | journal=Sci Am | volume=259 | issue=4 | pages=110–9 | year=1988 | pmid=3072667 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1088-110}}</ref>

==Side effects==
Most common side-effects include nausea, vomiting, acid reflux (heartburn), headache, cosmetic reduction in abdominal body fat, light sleeping, and loss of appetite. Less common side effects include faint discoloration of fingernails and toenails, mood elevation, occasional tingling or transient numbness of the hands or feet, and minor skin discoloration. Allergic reactions are rare.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/zidovudine_azt-oral/page2.htm|title=zidovudine, Retrovir|date=2010-08-12|publisher=Medicinenet.com|accessdate=2010-12-14|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220035237/http://www.medicinenet.com/zidovudine_azt-oral/page2.htm|archivedate=2010-12-20|df=}}</ref>

===Viral resistance===
Even at the highest doses that can be tolerated in patients, AZT is not potent enough to prevent all HIV replication and may only slow the replication of the virus and progression of the disease. Prolonged AZT treatment can lead to HIV developing resistance to AZT by [[mutation]] of its [[reverse transcriptase]].<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 2186629 | last1 = Richman | first1 = D. | title = Susceptibility to nucleoside analogues of zidovudine-resistant isolates of human immunodeficiency virus | journal = The American Journal of Medicine | volume = 88 | issue = 5B | pages = 8S–10S | year = 1990 | doi=10.1016/0002-9343(90)90414-9}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 15855480 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.49.5.1671-1678.2005 | last1 = Wainberg | first1 = M.

==Mechanism of action==
[[Image:Azt pills.JPG|thumb|right|250px|AZT in oral, injectable, and suppository form]]
AZT is a [[thymidine]] analogue. AZT works by selectively inhibiting HIV's [[reverse transcriptase]], the [[enzyme]] that the virus uses to make a [[DNA]] copy of its [[RNA]]. Reverse transcription is necessary for production of HIV's double-stranded [[DNA]], which would be subsequently integrated into the genetic material of the infected [[cell (biology)|cell]] (where it is called a [[provirus]]).<ref name=MitsuyaPNAS/><ref name="Yarchoan R, Klecker R, Weinhold K, Markham P, Lyerly H, Durack D, Gelmann E, Lehrman S, Blum R, Barry D 1986 575–80"/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mitsuya H, Yarchoan R, Broder S | title=Molecular targets for AIDS therapy | journal=Science | volume=249 | issue=4976 | pages=1533–44 | year=1990 | pmid=1699273 | doi=10.1126/science.1699273|bibcode = 1990Sci...249.1533M }}</ref>

Cellular enzymes convert AZT into the effective 5'-triphosphate form.

==History==
In the 1960s the theory that most [[cancer]]s were caused by environmental [[retrovirus]]es gained clinical support and funding. It had recently become known, due to the work of Nobel laureates [[Howard Temin]] and [[David Baltimore]],<ref name="test75">[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1975/temin-lecture.html The DNA Provirus Hypothesis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103002308/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1975/temin-lecture.html |date=2017-01-03 }}</ref> that nearly all avian cancers were caused by bird retroviruses, but corresponding human retroviruses have not yet been found.

In parallel work, other compounds that successfully blocked the synthesis of nucleic acids had been proven to be both antibacterial, antiviral, and anticancer agents, the leading work being done at the laboratory of Nobel laureates [[George Hitchings]] and [[Gertrude Elion]], leading to the development of the antitumor agent [[6-mercaptopurine]].<ref name="test88">[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1988/elion-lecture.pdf The Purine Path To Chemotherapy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808212611/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1988/elion-lecture.pdf |date=2017-08-08 }}</ref>

Azidothymidine was first synthesized at the Michigan Cancer foundation in 1964 as part of a program directed toward the discovery of anticancer drugs.  It gave negative results and attracted little further interest.  In 1974, Wofram Ostertag at the Max Planck Institute demonstrated the ability of AZT to inhibit the replication of the Friend leukemia virus in cell culture.  This report attracted little interest from other researchers as the Friend leukemia virus is a retrovirus, and at the time, there were no known human diseases caused by retroviruses.<ref name="Sneader 2006 260–261">{{cite book |last=Sneader |first1=Walter |title=Drug Discovery - A History |publisher=Wiley |year=2006 |pages=260–261 |isbn=978-0-471-89980-8 }}</ref>

In June 1984, Burroughs-Wellcome virologist Marty St. Clair set up a program to discover drugs with the potential to inhibit HIV replication. Burroughs-Wellcome had expertise in nucleoside analogs and viral diseases, led by researchers including [[George Hitchings]], [[Gertrude B. Elion|Gertrude Elion]], David Barry, Paul (Chip) McGuirt Jr., Philip Furman, Martha St. Clair, Janet Rideout, Sandra Lehrman and others. Their research efforts were focused in part on the viral enzyme [[reverse transcriptase]]. Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme that retroviruses, including HIV, utilize to replicate themselves. Secondary testing was performed in mouse cells infected with the retroviruses Friend virus or Harvey sarcoma virus, as the Wellcome group did not have a viable in-house HIV antiviral assay in place at that time, and these other retroviruses were believed to represent reasonable surrogates.  AZT proved to be a remarkably potent inhibitor of both Friend virus and Harvey sarcoma virus, and a search of the company's records showed that it had demonstrated low toxicity when tested for its antibacterial activity in rats many years earlier. Based in part on these results, AZT was selected by nucleoside chemist Janet Rideout as one of 11 compounds to send to the NCI for testing in that organization's HIV antiviral assay.<ref name="Sneader 2006 260–261"/>

In February 1985, the NCI scientists found that AZT had potent efficacy in vitro.<ref name=MitsuyaPNAS/><ref name=pmid20018391/> 
Several months later, a phase 1 [[clinical trial]] of AZT at the NCI was initiated at the NCI and Duke University,.<ref name="Yarchoan R, Klecker R, Weinhold K, Markham P, Lyerly H, Durack D, Gelmann E, Lehrman S, Blum R, Barry D 1986 575–80">{{cite journal |vauthors=Yarchoan R, Klecker R, Weinhold K, Markham P, Lyerly H, Durack D, Gelmann E, Lehrman S, Blum R, Barry D | title=Administration of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine, an inhibitor of HTLV-III/LAV replication, to patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex | journal=Lancet | volume=1 | issue=8481 | pages=575–80 | year=1986 | pmid=2869302 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(86)92808-4}}</ref><ref name="Yarchoan R, Mitsuya H, Myers C, Broder S 1989 726–38">{{cite journal | doi=10.1056/NEJM198909143211106 |vauthors=Yarchoan R, Mitsuya H, Myers C, Broder S | title=Clinical pharmacology of 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (zidovudine) and related dideoxynucleosides | journal=N Engl J Med | volume=321 | issue=11 | pages=726–38 | year=1989 | pmid=2671731}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yarchoan R, Klecker RW, Weinhold KJ, Markham PD, Lyerly HK, Durack DT, Gelmann E, Lehrman SN, Blum RM, Barry DW |title=Administration of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine, an inhibitor of HTLV-III/LAV replication, to patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex |journal=Lancet |volume=1 |issue=8481 |pages=575–80 |year=1986 |pmid=2869302 |doi= 10.1016/s0140-6736(86)92808-4|url=}}</ref> 
In doing this Phase I trial, they built on their experience in doing an earlier trial, with suramin, another drug that had shown effective anti-HIV activity in the laboratory. This initial trial of AZT proved that the drug could be safely administered to patients with HIV, that it increased their [[CD4]] counts, restored T cell immunity as measured by skin testing, and that it showed strong evidence of clinical effectiveness, such as inducing weight gain in AIDS patients. It also showed that levels of AZT that worked in vitro could be injected into patients in serum and suppository form, and that the drug penetrated deeply only into infected brains.

A rigorous [[double-blind]], [[placebo]]-controlled [[randomized trial]] of AZT was subsequently conducted by Burroughs-Wellcome and proved that AZT safely prolongs the lives of people with HIV.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Fischl MA | title=The efficacy of azidothymidine (AZT) in the treatment of patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex.

In 1991, the advocacy group [[Public Citizen]] filed a lawsuit claiming that the patents were invalid. Subsequently, Barr Laboratories and Novopharm Ltd. also challenged the patent, in part based on the assertion that [[National Cancer Institute|NCI]] scientists [[Samuel Broder]], [[Hiroaki Mitsuya]], and [[Robert Yarchoan]] should have been named as inventors, and those two companies applied to the FDA to sell AZT as a generic drug. In response, [[Burroughs Wellcome]] Co. filed a lawsuit against the two companies. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] ruled in 1992 in favor of Burroughs Wellcome, ruling that even though they had never tested it against HIV, they had conceived of it working before they sent it to the NCI scientists. This suit was appealed up to the Supreme Court of the US, but in 1996 they declined to formally review it.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Greenhouse|first1=Linda|title=Supreme Court Roundup;Justices Reject Challenge Of Patent for AIDS Drug|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/17/us/supreme-court-roundup-justices-reject-challenge-of-patent-for-aids-drug.html|work=The New York Times|date=January 17, 1996|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117145258/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/17/us/supreme-court-roundup-justices-reject-challenge-of-patent-for-aids-drug.html|archivedate=November 17, 2016|df=}}</ref> The case, [[Burroughs Wellcome Co. v.
