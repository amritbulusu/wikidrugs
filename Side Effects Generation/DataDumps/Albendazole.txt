== Pharmacology ==
[[File:Microtubule structure.png|thumb|A microtubule is composed of polymers of α- and β-tubulin.]]
=== Mechanism of action ===
As a vermicidal, albendazole causes degenerative alterations in the intestinal cells of the worm by binding to the [[colchicine]]-sensitive site of [[Tubulin#β-Tubulin|β-tubulin]], thus inhibiting its polymerization or assembly into [[microtubules]] (it binds much better to the β-tubulin of parasites than that of mammals).<ref name=AHFS2015 /><ref name=dailymed /> Albendazole leads to impaired uptake of glucose by the larval and adult stages of the susceptible parasites, and depletes their [[glycogen]] stores. Albendazole also prevents the formation of spindle fibers needed for cell division, which in turn blocks egg production and development; existing eggs are prevented from hatching.<ref name=turner-horton /><ref>{{cite book | last=Georgiev | first=Vassil St | title=Infectious Diseases in Immunocompromised Hosts | date=1997 | page=695 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=73QOP6Xqh6EC&pg=PA695 | publisher=CRC Press | isbn=978-0-8493-8553-7}}</ref> Cell motility, maintenance of cell shape, and intracellular transport are also disrupted.<ref name=riviere>{{cite book | last1=Riviere | first1=Jim E. | last2=Papich | first2=Mark G. | title=Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics | date=March 17, 2009 | pages=1054, 1062 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ievLulSqwBAC&pg=PA1054 | publisher=John Wiley & Sons | isbn=978-0-8138-2061-3 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603202647/https://books.google.com/books?id=ievLulSqwBAC | archivedate=June 3, 2016 | df= }}</ref> At higher concentrations, it disrupts the helminths' metabolic pathways by inhibiting metabolic enzymes such as [[malate dehydrogenase]] and [[fumarate reductase]], with inhibition of the latter leading to less energy produced by the [[Kreb's cycle]].<ref name=plumb /><ref name="parasitipedia-toxicity" /><ref name=waller-simpson>{{cite book | last1=Waller | first1=Derek G. | last2=Sampson | first2=Tony | title=Medical Pharmacology and Therapeutics E-Book | date=June 4, 2017 | page=616 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6b0tDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA616 | publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences | isbn=978-0-7020-7190-4}}</ref> Due to diminished ATP production, the parasite is immobilized and eventually dies.

Some parasites have evolved to have some resistance to albendazole by having a different set of acids comprising β-tubulin, decreasing the [[binding affinity]] of albendazole.<ref name=dailymed />

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Oral absorption of albendazole varies among species, with 1–5% of the drug being successfully absorbed in humans, 20–30% in rats, and 50% in cattle.<ref name=dayan/>

The absorption also largely depends on gastric pH. People have varying gastric pHs on empty stomachs, and thus absorption from one person to another can vary wildly when taken without food.<ref name=gouma /> Generally, the absorption in the GI tract is poor due to albendazole's low solubility in water.<ref name=AHFS2015 /> It is, however, better absorbed than other benzimidazole carbamates.<ref name=finch /> Food stimulates gastric acid secretion, lowering the pH and making albendazole more soluble and thus more easily absorbed.<ref name=bennett /> Oral absorption is especially increased with a fatty meal, as albendazole dissolves better in lipids, allowing it to cross the lipid barrier created by the [[Mucous membrane|mucus surface]] of the GI tract.<ref name="riviere" /><ref name=dayan>{{cite journal | last=Dayan | first=A.

Absorption is also affected by how much of the albendazole is degraded within the small intestine by metabolic enzymes in the vili.<ref name="gouma" />
[[File:Albendazole metabolism.svg|thumb|622x622px|General metabolism of albendazole and its sulfoxides.]]

Albendazole has been used as an anthelminthic and for control of flukes in a variety of animal species, including cattle, sheep, goats, swine, camels, dogs, cats, elephants, poultry, and others.<ref name=parasitipedia-toxicity /><ref>{{cite book | last=Fowler | first=Murray E. | title=Biology, Medicine, and Surgery of Elephants | date=October 2, 2006 | page=174 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oCpiZA61tyQC&pg=PA174 | publisher=John Wiley & Sons | isbn=978-0-8138-0676-1 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908140627/https://books.google.com/books?id=oCpiZA61tyQC&pg=PA174 | archivedate=September 8, 2017 | df= }}</ref> Side effects include anorexia in dogs and lethargy, depression, and anorexia in cats,<ref name=plumb /> with more than 10% of dogs and cats having anorexia.<ref name=wiebe /> Of dogs and cats, 1–10% experience elevated liver enzymes, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Less than 1% experience neutropenia or aplastic anemia, though these require a use of at least 5 days.<ref name=wiebe /> While it is also associated with bone marrow suppression and toxicity in cats and dogs at high doses, albendazole has a higher margin of safety in other species.<ref name=papich /><ref name=bowman /> Thus, it is usually only prescribed in cats and dogs when an infection is present that is resistant to the commonly prescribed [[metronidazole]] and [[fenbendazole]].<ref name=webster>{{cite book | last=Webster | first=Cynthia | title=Clinical Pharmacology | date=March 2001 | page=142 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NmR00leAkt8C&pg=PA142 | publisher=Teton NewMedia | isbn=978-1-893441-37-8 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908140627/https://books.google.com/books?id=NmR00leAkt8C&pg=PA142 | archivedate=2017-09-08 | df= }}</ref>

It is extensively used for ruminant livestock in [[Latin America]].<ref name=parasitipedia-ricobendazole /> It is marketed for this purpose by Zoetis (formerly Pfizer Animal Health) in numerous countries (including the United States and Canada) as Valbazen in oral suspension and paste formulations;<ref name=plumb /><ref name=papich /> by Interchemie in the Netherlands and elsewhere as Albenol-100; by Channelle Animal Health Ltd. in the United Kingdom as Albex; and by Ravensdown in New Zealand (as Albendazole). Although most formulations are administered orally, Ricomax (ricobendazole, or albendazole sulfoxide) is administered by subcutaneous injection.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

Albendazole has greater bioavailability in ruminants: some albendazole sulfoxide, when released back into the rumen, is reduced to albendazole by the resident microbiota, with a preference of the (+) enantiomer being the substrate.<ref name=capece /><ref name=riviere /> Cats and dogs, having no rumen reservoir, sometimes need higher or more frequent doses as compared to ruminants. In dogs, albendazole sulfoxide is detectable in the plasma for less than 12 hours, but in sheep and goats, it remains at measurable levels for around three days.<ref name=parasitipedia-toxicity />

=== Meat ===
{{more refs|section|date=August 2017}}
The limitations in early pregnancy are due to a limited period during which teratogenic effects may occur. Summarized research data relating to the durations of these preslaughter and early pregnancy periods when albendazole should not be administered are found in US FDA NADA 110-048 (cattle) and 140-934 (sheep). Some data and inferences regarding goats are found in US FDA Supplemental NADA 110-048 (approved January 24, 2008).

Maximum residue limits (MRLs) for albendazole in food, adopted by the FAO/WHO [[Codex Alimentarius]] in 1993, are 5000, 5000, 100, and 100 micrograms per kilogram of body weight (μg/kg) for kidney, liver, fat, and muscle, respectively, and 100 μg/L for milk.  For analysis purposes, MRLs of various nations may pertain to concentration of a marker substance which has been correlated with concentrations of the administered substance and its metabolized products. For example, in Canada, the marker substance specified by Health Canada is albendazole-2-aminosulfone, for which the MRL in liver of cattle is 200 μg/kg.

There is a 27 days cattle withdrawal time for meat.<ref name=papich />
