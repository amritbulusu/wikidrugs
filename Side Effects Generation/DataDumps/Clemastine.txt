'''Clemastine''', also known as '''meclastin''', is an [[antihistamine]] and [[anticholinergic]].<ref>Anon., {{Cite patent|GB|942152}} (1963).</ref> Unlike [[loratadine]] or [[fexofenadine]], clemastine is a sedating antihistamine; however, it exhibits fewer other side effects than most of the widely used antihistamines.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Clemastine is also classified as an [[antipruritic]] (i.e., it stops itching).

==Indications==
Clemastine is indicated for use in treating allergic [[rhinitis]], such as [[sneezing]], [[rhinorrhea]], [[pruritus]] and [[lacrimation]].{{mcn|date=May 2015}}

==Side effects==
Overdosage symptoms are paradoxical, ranging from [[central nervous system|CNS]] depression to stimulation. Stimulation is most common in children, and is usually followed by excitement, [[hallucinations]], [[ataxia]], loss of coordination, [[muscle twitching]], [[athetosis]], [[hyperthermia]], [[cyanosis]], convulsions, [[tremor]]s, and [[hyperreflexia]]. This may be followed by [[postictal state|postictal]] depression and [[Respiratory arrest|cardiovascular/respiratory arrest]]. Other common overdose symptoms include dry mouth, fixed dilated pupils, flushing of the face, and [[pyrexia]]. In adults, overdose usually leads to CNS depression, ranging from drowsiness to [[coma]].{{mcn|date=May 2015}}

==Pharmacology==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}
Clemastine is an antihistamine with [[anticholinergic]] and [[sedative]] effects. Antihistamines competitively bind to [[histamine]] receptor sites, thus reducing the neurotransmitter's effects. Effects of histamine (which are countered by antihistamines) include:
* Increased capillary permeability
* Increased capillary dilatation
* [[Edema]] (i.e., swelling) 
* [[Pruritus]] (Itch)
* Gastrointestinal/respiratory smooth muscle constriction

Clemastine inhibits both the [[vasoconstrictor]] and [[vasodilator]] effects of histamine. Depending on the dose, the drug can produce paradoxical effects, including CNS stimulation or depression.

Most antihistamines exhibit some type of [[anticholinergic]] activity. Antihistamines act by competitively binding to H<sub>1</sub>-receptor sites, thus blocking the binding endogenous histamine. Antihistamines do not chemically inactivate or prevent the normal release of histamine.

Clemastine does also act as [[FIASMA]] (functional inhibitor of [[Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase|acid sphingomyelinase]]).<ref name="pmid18504571">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kornhuber J, Muehlbacher M, Trapp S, Pechmann S, Friedl A, Reichel M, Mühle C, Terfloth L, Groemer T, Spitzer G, Liedl K, Gulbins E, Tripal P|title=Identification of novel functional inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=6|issue=8|pages=e23852|year=2011|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0023852|pmid=21909365|pmc=3166082}}</ref>

Clemastine is rapidly absorbed from the [[gastrointestinal tract]] and peak plasma concentrations are attained in 2–4 hours. Antihistamines are thought to be metabolized in the liver, mostly by mono-/didemethylation and glucuronide conjugation. It is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 [[CYP2D6]] and may interfere with other drugs metabolized by this isozyme.

==Mechanism of action==
Clemastine is a selective histamine H<sub>1</sub> antagonist. It binds to the histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptor, thus blocking the action of [[endogenous]] histamine, which leads to temporary relief of the negative symptoms caused by histamine.{{mcn|date=May 2015}}

==Society and culture==
Clemastine is an [[Over-the-counter substance|OTC]] drug, and is available under many names and dosage forms worldwide. Most common brand name is '''Tavegyl'''.<ref>drugs.com [http://www.drugs.com/international/clemastine.html Clemastine at drugs.com international listings] Page accessed May 10, 2015</ref>
