==Pharmacology==
Bremelanotide is a [[non-selective]] [[agonist]] of the [[melanocortin receptor]]s, [[melanocortin 1 receptor|MC<sub>1</sub>]] through [[melanocortin 5 receptor|MC<sub>5</sub>]] (with the exception of [[melanocortin 2 receptor|MC<sub>2</sub>]], the receptor of {{abbrlink|ACTH|adrenocorticotropic hormone}}), but acting primarily as an [[melanocortin 3 receptor|MC<sub>3</sub>]] and [[melanocortin 4 receptor|MC<sub>4</sub> receptor]] agonist.<ref name=King2007rev>{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = King SH, Mayorov AV, Balse-Srinivasan P, Hruby VJ, Vanderah TW, Wessells H | title = Melanocortin receptors, melanotropic peptides and penile erection | journal = Curr Top Med Chem | volume = 7 | issue = 11 | pages = 1098–1106 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17584130 | pmc = 2694735 | doi = 10.2174/1568026610707011111}}</ref><ref name=Gelman2017rev/><ref name=Kingsberg2015rev>{{cite journal|last1=Kingsberg|first1=SA|last2=Clayton|first2=AH|last3=Pfaus|first3=JG|title=The Female Sexual Response: Current Models, Neurobiological Underpinnings and Agents Currently Approved or Under Investigation for the Treatment of Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder.|journal=CNS drugs|date=November 2015|volume=29|issue=11|pages=915-33|doi=10.1007/s40263-015-0288-1|pmid=26519340}}</ref>

==Chemistry==
Bremelanotide is a [[cyclic compound|cyclic]] [[heptapeptide]] [[lactam]] [[structural analog|analogue]] of [[α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone]] (α-MSH).<ref name=Belkin2015rev>{{cite journal|last1=Belkin|first1=ZR|last2=Krapf|first2=JM|last3=Goldstein|first3=AT|title=Drugs in early clinical development for the treatment of female sexual dysfunction.|journal=Expert opinion on investigational drugs|date=February 2015|volume=24|issue=2|pages=159-67|doi=10.1517/13543784.2015.978283|pmid=25376023}}</ref> It has the [[amino acid sequence]] Ac-Nle-''cyclo''[Asp-His-<small>D</small>-Phe-Arg-Trp-Lys]-OH,<ref name=INN>{{cite journal|title=Proposed INN List 95|journal=WHO Drug Information|date=2006|volume=20|issue=2|page=124|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/druginformation/innlists/PL95.pdf?ua=1}}</ref>  and is also known as ''cyclo''-[Nle<sup>4</sup>,Asp<sup>5</sup>,<small>D</small>-Phe<sup>7</sup>,Lys<sup>10</sup>]α-MSH-(4-10). Bremelanotide is an [[active metabolite]] of melanotan II that lacks the [[C-terminus|C-terminal]] [[amide]] [[functional group|group]].<ref name=Hadley2005/>

Aside from melanotan II and endogenous [[melanocyte-stimulating hormone]]s like α-MSH, other analogues of bremelanotide include [[afamelanotide]] (NDP-α-MSH), [[modimelanotide]], and [[setmelanotide]].

==History==
Research in the early 1960s showed that in rats, administration of α-MSH caused sexual arousal, and work on this continued in many labs up through the 1980s, when scientists at University of Arizona began attempting to develop α-MSH and analogs as potential [[sunless tanning]] agents, and synthesized and tested several analogs, including [[melanotan-I]] and [[melanotan II]].<ref name=King2007rev/><ref name=Hadley2005>{{cite journal|last1=Hadley|first1=ME|title=Discovery that a melanocortin regulates sexual functions in male and female humans.|journal=Peptides|date=October 2005|volume=26|issue=10|pages=1687-9|doi=10.1016/j.peptides.2005.01.023|pmid=15996790}}</ref>  

Very early in the process one of the scientists, who was conducting experiments on himself with an early tool compound, melanotan II, injected himself with twice the dose he intended and experienced an eight-hour erection, along with nausea and vomiting.<ref name=King2007rev/>

To pursue the tanning agent, melanotan-I was licensed by Competitive Technologies, a [[technology transfer]] company operating on behalf of University of Arizona, to an Australian startup called Epitan,<ref>{{cite news|title=EpiTan focuses on Melanotan, a potential blockbuster|url=https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/epitan-focuses-on-melanotan-a-potential-blockbuster|work=The Pharma Letter|date=1 November 2004|language=en}}</ref><ref name=HadleyDorr2006>{{cite journal|last1=Hadley|first1=ME|last2=Dorr|first2=RT|title=Melanocortin peptide therapeutics: historical milestones, clinical studies and commercialization.|journal=Peptides|date=April 2006|volume=27|issue=4|pages=921-30|doi=10.1016/j.peptides.2005.01.029|pmid=16412534}}</ref> which changed its name to Clinuvel in 2006.<ref>{{cite news|title=Epitan changes name to Clinuvel, announces new clinical program|url=http://www.labonline.com.au/content/life-scientist/news/epitan-changes-name-to-clinuvel-announces-new-clinical-program-161764385|work=LabOnline|date=27 February 2006|language=en}}</ref>
 
To pursue the sexual dysfunction agent, melanotan-II was licensed by Competitive Technologies to Palatin Technologies.<ref name=Hadley2005/>   Palatin ceased development of melanotan-II in 2000 and synthesized, patented, and began to develop brelemanotide, a likely metabolite of melanotan-II that differs from melanotan-II in that it has a hydroxyl group where melanotan-II has an amide.<ref name=King2007rev/><ref name=Litigation/> Competitive Technologies sued Palatin for breach of contract and to try to claim ownership of brelemanotide;<ref name=Litigation>{{cite news|title=Press Release: Palatin Technologies Refutes Competitive Technologies Contention of Material Breach|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/palatin-technologies-refutes-competitive-technologies-contention-of-material-breach-58006787.html|work=Palatin Technologies via PR Newswire|date=September 12, 2007|language=en}}</ref> the parties settled in 2008 with Palatin retaining rights to brelemanotide, returning rights to melanotan-II to Competitive Technologies, and paying $800,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Press Release: Palatin Technologies Announces Litigation Settlement With Competitive Technologies|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/palatin-technologies-announces-litigation-settlement-with-competitive-technologies-57107302.html|work=Palatin Technologies via PR Newswire|date=January 22, 2008|language=en}}</ref>

In August 2004 Palatin signed an agreement with [[King Pharmaceuticals]] to co-develop bremelanotide in the US and jointly license it outside the US; King paid Palatin $20M upfront.<ref>{{cite web|title=Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2004|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/911216/000108802004000046/form10-k_063004.htm|publisher=Palatin via SEC EDGAR|date=13 September 2004}}</ref>

Palatin conducted Phase II trials of intranasal bremelanotide in both female sexual dysfunction (FSD) and male erectile dysfunction (ED) but these trials were halted by the FDA in 2007 due to increased [[blood pressure]] in clinical trial subjects; Palatin stopped development of the intranasal formulation in 2008.<ref name=Lodise2013rev>{{cite journal|last1=Lodise|first1=NM|title=Hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women: treatment options beyond testosterone and approaches to communicating with patients on sexual health.|journal=Pharmacotherapy|date=April 2013|volume=33|issue=4|pages=411-21|doi=10.1002/phar.1209|pmid=23553810}}</ref><ref name=Gelman2017rev/><ref name=Ückert2014rev>{{cite journal|last1=Ückert|first1=S|last2=Bannowsky|first2=A|last3=Albrecht|first3=K|last4=Kuczyk|first4=MA|title=Melanocortin receptor agonists in the treatment of male and female sexual dysfunctions: results from basic research and clinical studies.|journal=Expert opinion on investigational drugs|date=November 2014|volume=23|issue=11|pages=1477-83|doi=10.1517/13543784.2014.934805|pmid=25096243}}</ref>  Four trials were conducted in ED, the last being a Phase IIb published in 2008.<ref name=Ückert2014rev/>  King terminated the co-development agreement shortly after the FDA halted the trials.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nagle|first1=Mike|title=Erectile dysfunction drug deemed a flop|url=http://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Preclinical-Research/Erectile-dysfunction-drug-deemed-a-flop|work=Outsourcing Pharma|date=10 September 2007}}</ref>

The drug was then [[Pharmaceutical formulation|reformulated]] to be delivered by injection and trials continued in FSD.  A phase II dose-finding trial in FSD in which the drug was administered 45 minutes before sex showed promise at the highest dose and only transient signs of high blood pressure; two Phase III trials were launched at the end of 2014.<ref name=Kingsberg2015rev/><ref name=Belkin2015rev/>  Palatin launched the Phase III trials with bremelanotide administered via an [[autoinjector]].<ref name=10K2015/>

In 2014 Palatin licensed European rights to bremelanotide to [[Gedeon Richter Plc.]] for around $10 million, and Palatin received a milestone payment of around $3 million when it started the Phase III trials in the US.  In September 2016 Palatin and Gedeon RIchter terminated that agreement.<ref name=10K2015>{{cite web|title=Palatin 10K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/911216/000135448815004334/ptn_10k.htm|publisher=Palatin via SEC EDGAR|date=September 18, 2015}}</ref>  

In November 2016 Palatin announced results of the Phase III trials, and shortly thereafter began seeking a partner to complete development in the US.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Reuters|title=Female Viagra: Drugmaker Palatin Is Looking for a Buyer|url=http://fortune.com/2016/11/02/female-viagra-addyi-palatin/|work=Fortune|date=November 2, 2016}}</ref> In January 2017 Palatin and [[AMAG Pharmaceuticals]] agreed that AMAG exclusively would complete development and market bremelanotide in North America and the two would work together to license it in other territories; AMAG agreed to pay $60 million upfront, up to $80 million in regulatory milestones, up to $300 million in sales milestones, and tiered royalties ranging from high single digit to low double digit percentages.<ref>{{cite news|title=AMAG Pharma closes deal for North America rights to Rekynda|url=https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/amag-pharma-closes-deal-for-north-america-rights-to-rekynda|work=The Pharma Letter|date=February 2, 2017|language=en}}</ref>
