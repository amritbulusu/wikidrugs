'''Iloperidone''', also known as '''Fanapt''', '''Fanapta''', and previously known as '''Zomaril''', is an  [[atypical antipsychotic]] for the treatment of [[schizophrenia]].

==Medical uses==
Iloperidone is used for the treatment of [[schizophrenia]]. In a 2013 study in a comparison of 15 antipsychotic drugs in effectivity in treating schizophrenic symptoms, iloperidone was found to be almost as effective as [[ziprasidone]], [[chlorpromazine]], and [[asenapine]], and as effective as [[lurasidone]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Leucht|first1=Stefan|last2=Cipriani|first2=Andrea|last3=Spineli|first3=Loukia|last4=Mavridis|first4=Dimitris|last5=Örey|first5=Deniz|last6=Richter|first6=Franziska|last7=Samara|first7=Myrto|last8=Barbui|first8=Corrado|last9=Engel|first9=Rolf R|last10=Geddes|first10=John R|last11=Kissling|first11=Werner|last12=Stapf|first12=Marko Paul|last13=Lässig|first13=Bettina|last14=Salanti|first14=Georgia|last15=Davis|first15=John M|title=Comparative efficacy and tolerability of 15 antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia: a multiple-treatments meta-analysis|journal=The Lancet|date=September 2013|volume=382|issue=9896|pages=951–962|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60733-3}}</ref>

==Availability==
It was approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for use in the [[United States]] on May 6, 2009.

== Pharmacology ==
Iloperidone is a monoamine directed towards acting upon and antagonizing specific neurotransmitters, particularly multiple [[dopamine]] and [[serotonin]] receptor subtypes. It is considered an ‘atypical’ antipsychotic because it displays serotonin receptor antagonism, similar to other atypical antipsychotics.  The older [[typical antipsychotic]]s are primarily dopamine antagonists.

Iloperidone has been shown to act as an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] at all tested receptors. It exhibits high (nM) affinity to serotonin 5HT<sub>2A</sub> (Ki value of 5.6 nM), dopamine D<sub>2</sub> (6.3 nM) and D<sub>3</sub> (7.1 nM) and noradrenaline α<sub>1</sub> receptors (0.36 nM), moderate affinity for dopamine D<sub>4</sub> (25 nM), serotonin 5HT<sub>6</sub> (43 nM), 5HT<sub>7</sub> (22 nM), and low affinity for the serotonin 5HT<sub>1A</sub> (168 nM), dopamine D<sub>1</sub> and histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors. In addition, pharmacogenomic studies identified [[single nucleotide polymorphisms]] associated with an enhanced response to iloperidone during acute treatment of schizophrenia.<ref name="ilo">Scott L.[http://adisonline.com/cnsdrugs/abstract/2009/23100/Iloperidone__In_Schizophrenia.5.aspx Iloperidone: In Schizophrenia].

== Laboratory studies ==
Iloperidone performed well against a [[prepulse inhibition]] (PPI) experiment, which was designed to gauge the extent of sensory gating in rats, a process disrupted in schizophrenia. Prepulse inhibition is the reduction in the amount of startle the subject gives when presented with a non-startling stimulus. Those exhibiting high levels of psychosis present a deficit in PPI. [[Psychosis]] induced using [[Phencyclidine|PCP]], [[apomorphine]], and [[cirazoline]], were all prevented with the concurrent administration of iloperidone. The PPI deficit normally incurred by each psychotic drug was significantly diminished by the co administration of iloperidone.<ref>{{cite journal

Iloperidone has also been shown to reduce the effects of apomorphine induced climbing behavior in mice as well as the effects of head twitching induced by 5-HT in rats.<ref>{{cite journal

== Clinical studies ==
Several large (n > 570 per trial), double-blind, multinational, multicentre trials showed iloperidone generally had better efficacy than placebo when using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) or Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores.<ref name="ilo"/>
Clinical studies have also shown that some patients treated with iloperidone show reduced extrapyramidal symptoms and weight gain. Phase II testing has shown that effectiveness in humans is possible with as low as 8&nbsp;mg per day, and is tolerable up to 4&nbsp;mg per day.

== Side effects ==
Examination of the safety and tolerability of iloperidone have shown that at a 5&nbsp;mg/day dose in healthy male volunteers, the drug was fairly well tolerated, although [[hypotension]], dizziness, and somnolence were very common side effects ranging from mild to moderate in severity.  A second study showed that co administration of food decreased the severity of these effects. This study also indicated that repeat administration of iloperidone could decrease the effects of hypotension.<ref>{{cite journal

The approved dose is 12–24&nbsp;mg not 5&nbsp;mg. However, claims of better tolerance have been reported.

In some cases (prevalence unknown), it can greatly increase agitation and aggressivity like all antipsychotics drugs.

== Dosage ==
Vanda Pharmaceuticals has stated that they are developing both oral and injectable formulations. The injectable formulation is being developed to be administered at four week intervals.

==Regulatory approval==
[[Hoechst AG|Hoechst Marion Roussel Inc.]] made initial inquiries into the drug; however, in May 1996, they discontinued research, and in June 1997 gave research rights to [[Titan Pharmaceuticals]].  Titan then handed over worldwide development, manufacturing and marketing rights to [[Novartis]] in August 1998. On June 9, 2004, Titan Pharmaceuticals announced that the Phase III development rights have been acquired by Vanda Pharmaceuticals. The original launch date was scheduled for 2002. On November 27, 2007, Vanda Pharmaceuticals announced that the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) had accepted their [[New Drug Application]] for iloperidone, confirming the application is ready for FDA review and approval.<ref>{{cite press release
