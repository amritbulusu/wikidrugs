It is a starch blocker, and inhibits [[alpha glucosidase]], an intestinal enzyme that releases [[glucose]] from larger [[carbohydrate]]s. It is composed of an [[acarviosin]] moiety with a [[maltose]] at the reducing terminus.

==Mechanism of action==
Acarbose inhibits enzymes ([[glycoside hydrolase]]s) needed to digest [[carbohydrate]]s, specifically, [[alpha-glucosidase]] enzymes in the brush border of the small intestines, and pancreatic [[alpha-amylase]]. [[Pancreas|Pancreatic]] alpha-amylase hydrolyzes complex starches to [[oligosaccharides]] in the lumen of the small intestine, whereas the membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucosidases hydrolyze [[oligosaccharide]]s, [[trisaccharide]]s, and [[disaccharide]]s to [[glucose]] and other [[monosaccharide]]s in the small intestine. Inhibition of these enzyme systems reduces the rate of digestion of complex carbohydrates. Less glucose is absorbed because the carbohydrates are not broken down into glucose molecules. In [[diabetic]] patients, the short-term effect of these drug therapies is to decrease current blood glucose levels; the long-term effect is a reduction in [[Glycated hemoglobin|HbA<sub>1c</sub>]] level.<ref>''Drug Therapy in Nursing'', 2nd Edition.</ref> This reduction averages an absolute decrease of 0.7%, which is a decrease of about 10% in typical HbA<sub>1c</sub> values in diabetes studies.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 9805641 | volume=24 | issue=4 | title=Clinical efficacy of acarbose in diabetes mellitus: a critical review of controlled trials |date=September 1998 | journal=Diabetes Metab. | pages=311–20 | last1 = Scheen | first1 = AJ}}</ref>

==Dosing==
Since acarbose prevents the digestion of complex carbohydrates, the drug should be taken at the start of main meals (taken with first bite of meal). Moreover, the amount of complex carbohydrates in the meal will determine the effectiveness of acarbose in decreasing [[postprandial]] [[hyperglycemia]].  Adults may take doses of 25&nbsp;mg 3 times daily, increasing to 100&nbsp;mg 3 times a day. {{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Side-effects==
Since acarbose prevents the degradation of complex carbohydrates into glucose, some carbohydrate will remain in the intestine and be delivered to the colon.  In the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]], bacteria digest the complex carbohydrates, causing gastrointestinal side-effects such as [[flatulence]] (78% of patients) and [[diarrhea]] (14% of patients). Since these effects are dose-related, in general it is advised to start with a low dose and gradually increase the dose to the desired amount. One study found that gastrointestinal side effects decreased significantly (from 50% to 15%) over 24 weeks, even on constant dosing.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 9428831 | volume=103 | issue=6 | title=Efficacy of 24-week monotherapy with acarbose, metformin, or placebo in dietary-treated NIDDM patients: the Essen-II Study |date=December 1997 | journal=Am.

If a patient using acarbose suffers from a bout of [[hypoglycemia]], the patient must eat something containing [[monosaccharide]]s, such as glucose tablets or gel (GlucoBurst, Insta-Glucose, Glutose, Level One) and a doctor should be called. Because acarbose blocks the breakdown of table sugar and other complex sugars, fruit juice or starchy foods will not effectively reverse a hypoglycemic episode in a patient taking acarbose.<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a696015.html"Acarbose: MedlinePlus Drug Information]</ref>

[[Hepatitis]] has been reported with acarbose use.  It usually goes away when the medicine is stopped.<ref>http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js2268e/2.html#Js2268e.2.1</ref> Therefore, liver enzymes should be checked before and during use of this medicine.
