<!-- History and culture -->
Bedaquiline was approved for medical use in the United States in 2012.<ref name=AHFS2016/> It is on the [[World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines]], the most effective and safe medicines needed in a [[health system]].<ref name=WHO19th>{{cite web|title=WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (19th List)|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/EML_2015_FINAL_amended_NOV2015.pdf?ua=1|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=8 December 2016|date=April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213052708/http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/EML_2015_FINAL_amended_NOV2015.pdf?ua=1|archivedate=13 December 2016|df=}}</ref> The cost for six months is approximately $900 USD in low income countries, $3,000 USD in middle income countries, and $30,000 USD in high income countries.<ref name=WHO2015Report/>

==Medical uses==
Its use was formally approved (Dec 2012) by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for use in [[tuberculosis]] (TB) treatment, as part of a [[Fast track (FDA)|Fast-Track]] [[accelerated approval]], for use only in cases of [[multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis|multidrug-resistant tuberculosis]], and the more resistant [[extensively drug resistant tuberculosis]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm333695.htm |title=Press Announcements - FDA approves first drug to treat multi-drug resistant tuberculosis |website=www.fda.gov |language=en  |date=Dec 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161219184517/http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm333695.htm |archivedate=2016-12-19 |df= }}</ref>

{{as of|2013}} Both the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC) have recommended (provisionally) that bedaquiline be reserved for patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis when an otherwise recommended regimen cannot be designed.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|date=2013-10-25|title=Provisional CDC guidelines for the use and safety monitoring of bedaquiline fumarate (Sirturo) for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis|journal=MMWR |volume=62|issue=RR-09|pages=1–12|issn=1545-8601|pmid=24157696}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK154136/ |title=The use of bedaquiline in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis : interim policy guidance. |last=WHO |year=2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910170334/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK154136/ |archivedate=2017-09-10 |df= }}</ref>

===Clinical trials===
Bedaquiline has been studied in [[Phases of clinical research|phase IIb]] studies for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis while phase III studies are currently underway.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Field|first=Stephen K.|date=2015-07-01|title=Bedaquiline for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: great promise or disappointment?|url=http://taj.sagepub.com/content/6/4/170|journal=Therapeutic Advances in Chronic Disease|language=en|volume=6|issue=4|pages=170–184|doi=10.1177/2040622315582325|issn=2040-6223|pmc=4480545|pmid=26137207|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151028071912/http://taj.sagepub.com/content/6/4/170|archivedate=2015-10-28|df=}}</ref> It has been shown to improve cure rates of smear-positive multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, though with some concern for increased rates of death (further detailed in the Adverse effects section).<ref name=":2" />

Small studies have also examined its use as [[salvage therapy]] for [[Nontuberculous mycobacteria|non-tuberculous mycobacterial]] infections.<ref name=":0" />

It is a component of the experimental BPaMZ combination treatment (bedaquiline + [[pretomanid]] + [[moxifloxacin]] + [[pyrazinamide]]).<ref name=TBA-BPaMZ>[https://www.tballiance.org/portfolio/regimen/bpamz BPaMZ @ TB Alliance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219100904/https://www.tballiance.org/portfolio/regimen/bpamz |date=2017-02-19 }}</ref><ref name=NS2017>[https://www.newscientist.com/article/2121354-two-new-drug-therapies-might-cure-every-form-of-tuberculosis/ Two new drug therapies might cure every form of tuberculosis.

==Side effects==
The most common side effects of bedaquiline in studies were nausea, joint and chest pain, and headache. The drug also has a [[boxed warning|black-box warning]] for increased risk of death and [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|arrhythmias]], as it may prolong the QT interval by blocking the [[hERG]] channel.<ref>Drugs.com: [http://www.drugs.com/sfx/sirturo-side-effects.html Sirturo Side Effects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923172727/http://www.drugs.com/sfx/sirturo-side-effects.html |date=2013-09-23 }}</ref> All patients on bedaquiline should have monitoring with a baseline and repeated [[EKG|ECGs]].<ref name="fdaprescribing" /> If a patient has a QTcF of > 500ms or a significant ventricular arrythmia, bedaquiline and other QT prolonging drugs should be stopped.

There is considerable controversy over the approval for the drug, as one of the largest studies to date had more deaths in the group receiving bedaquiline that those receiving placebo.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=Edward|last2=Laessig|first2=Katherine|date=2014-08-21|title=FDA Approval of Bedaquiline — The Benefit–Risk Balance for Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMp1314385|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=371|issue=8|pages=689–691|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1314385|issn=0028-4793|pmid=25140952}}</ref> 10 deaths occurred in the bedaquiline group out of 79, while 2 occurred in the placebo group, out of 81.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Diacon|first=Andreas H.|last2=Pym|first2=Alexander|last3=Grobusch|first3=Martin P.|last4=de los Rios|first4=Jorge M.|last5=Gotuzzo|first5=Eduardo|last6=Vasilyeva|first6=Irina|last7=Leimane|first7=Vaira|last8=Andries|first8=Koen|last9=Bakare|first9=Nyasha|date=2014-08-21|title=Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis and Culture Conversion with Bedaquiline|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1313865|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=371|issue=8|pages=723–732|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1313865|issn=0028-4793|pmid=25140958}}</ref> Of the 10 deaths on bedaquiline, 1 was due to a motor vehicle accident, 5 were judged as due to progression of the underlying tuberculosis and 3 were well after the patient had stopped receiving bedaquiline.<ref name=":1" /> However there is still significant concern for the higher mortality in patients treated with bedaquiline, leading to the recommendation to limit its use to situations where a 4 drug regimen cannot otherwise be constructed, limit use with other medications that prolong the QT interval and the placement of a prominent [[Boxed warning|black box warning]].<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":0" />

==Drug interactions==
Bedaquiline should not be co-administered with other drugs that are strong inducers or inhibitors of [[CYP3A4]], the hepatic enzyme responsible for oxidative metabolism of the drug.<ref name="fdaprescribing">{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/204384s000lbl.pdf|title=Prescribing Information for Bedaquiline|accessdate=28 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824000016/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/204384s000lbl.pdf|archivedate=24 August 2013|df=}}</ref> Co-administration with [[rifampin]], a strong CYP3A4 inducer, results in a 52% decrease in the [[Area under the curve (pharmacokinetics)|AUC]] of the drug. This reduces the exposure of the body to the drug and decreases the antibacterial effect. Co-administration with [[ketoconazole]], a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, results in a 22% increase in the AUC, and potentially an increase in the rate of adverse effects experienced<ref name=fdaprescribing />

Since bedaquiline can also prolong the QT interval, use of other QT prolonging drugs should be avoided.<ref name=":3" /> Other medications for tuberculosis that can prolong the QT interval include [[fluoroquinolones]] and [[clofazimine]].

==Mode of action==
Bedaquiline blocks the [[proton pump]] for [[ATP synthase]] of mycobacteria. ATP production is required for cellular energy production and its loss leads to cell death, even in dormant or nonreplicating mycobacteria.<ref name=":4" /> It is the first member of a new class of drugs called the [[diarylquinoline]]s.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last=Worley|first=Marylee V.|last2=Estrada|first2=Sandy J.|date=2014-11-01|title=Bedaquiline: A Novel Antitubercular Agent for the Treatment of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/phar.1482/abstract|journal=Pharmacotherapy: The Journal of Human Pharmacology and Drug Therapy|language=en|volume=34|issue=11|pages=1187–1197|doi=10.1002/phar.1482|issn=1875-9114|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220163412/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/phar.1482/abstract|archivedate=2016-12-20|df=}}</ref> Bedaquiline is bactericidal.<ref name=":4" />

=== Resistance ===
The specific part of ATP synthase affected by bedaquiline is subunit c which is encoded by the gene atpE. Mutations in atpE can lead to resistance. Mutations in drug [[Efflux (microbiology)|efflux pumps]] have also been linked to resistance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Andries|first=Koen|last2=Villellas|first2=Cristina|last3=Coeck|first3=Nele|last4=Thys|first4=Kim|last5=Gevers|first5=Tom|last6=Vranckx|first6=Luc|last7=Lounis|first7=Nacer|last8=Jong|first8=Bouke C. de|last9=Koul|first9=Anil|date=2014-07-10|title=Acquired Resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to Bedaquiline|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0102135|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=9|issue=7|pages=e102135|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0102135|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4092087|pmid=25010492|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910170334/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0102135|archivedate=2017-09-10|df=}}</ref>
