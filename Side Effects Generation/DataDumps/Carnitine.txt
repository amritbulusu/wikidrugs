== Biosynthesis and metabolism ==
{{Main|carnitine biosynthesis}}
Many eukaryotes have the ability to synthesize carnitine, including humans.  Humans synthesize carnitine from the substrate TML (6-''N''-trimethyllysine), which is in turn derived from the [[methylation]] of the amino acid [[lysine]].  TML is then hydroxylated into hydroxytrimethyllysine (HTML) by [[trimethyllysine dioxygenase]], requiring the presence of [[ascorbic acid]].  HTML is then cleaved by HTML aldose, yielding 4-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde (TMABA) and [[glycine]].  TMABA is then [[dehydrogenated]] into gamma-butyrobetaine, in an NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent reaction, catalyzed by TMABA dehydrogenase.  Gamma-butyrobetaine is then hydroxylated by gamma butyrobetaine hydroxylase into <small>L</small>-carnitine, requiring iron in the form of [[Ferrous|Fe<sup>2+</sup>]].<ref name="synthesis">{{cite journal|last1=Strijbis|first1=Karin|last2=Vaz|first2=Frédéric M.|last3=Distel|first3=Ben|title=Enzymology of the carnitine biosynthesis pathway|journal=IUBMB Life|date=1 May 2010|volume=62|issue=5|pages=357–362|doi=10.1002/iub.323|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/iub.323/epdf|language=en|issn=1521-6551}}</ref>

Carnitine is involved in transporting fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane, by forming a long chain acetylcarnitine ester and being transported by [[carnitine palmitoyltransferase I]] and [[carnitine palmitoyltransferase II]].<ref name="Role of carnitine in disease">{{cite journal|last1=Flanagan|first1=Judith L|last2=Simmons|first2=Peter A|last3=Vehige|first3=Joseph|last4=Willcox|first4=Mark DP|last5=Garrett|first5=Qian|title=Role of carnitine in disease|journal=Nutrition & Metabolism|date=16 April 2010|volume=7|pages=30|doi=10.1186/1743-7075-7-30|pmc=2861661|issn=1743-7075}}</ref>  Carnitine also plays a role in stabilizing [[Acetyl-CoA]] and [[coenzyme A]] levels through the ability to receive or give an acetyl group.<ref name="sport"/>

== Physiological effects ==

===Deficiency===
{{see|Systemic primary carnitine deficiency}}
Carnitine deficiency caused by a genetic defect in carnitine transport occurs in roughly 1 in 50,000 in the US.  [[Systemic primary carnitine deficiency]] (SPDC) is characterized by various cardiological, metabolic and musculoskeletal symptoms that vary widely in age of onset and presentation.  Prognosis is generally good with carnitine supplementation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Magoulas|first1=Pilar L.|last2=El-Hattab|first2=Ayman W.|title=Systemic primary carnitine deficiency: an overview of clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management|journal=Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases|date=1 January 2012|volume=7|pages=68|doi=10.1186/1750-1172-7-68|url=https://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1750-1172-7-68|issn=1750-1172}}</ref>

Secondary carnitine deficiency may occur due to conditions such as malnutrition, poor absorption or access to only vegetables.<ref name="Role of carnitine in disease"/>

===Supplementation===

Some research has been carried out on carnitine supplementation in athletes, given its role in fatty acid metabolism; however, individual responses varied significantly in the 300 people involved in one study.{{vague|date=February 2017}}<ref name="sport"/>  Carnitine has been studied in various cardiometabolic conditions, with a bit of evidence pointing towards efficacy as an adjunct in [[heart disease]] and [[diabetes]].  However, there are insufficient trials to determine its efficacy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mingorance|first1=Carmen|last2=Rodríguez-Rodríguez|first2=Rosalía|last3=Justo|first3=María Luisa|last4=Álvarez de Sotomayor|first4=María|last5=Herrera|first5=María Dolores|title=Critical update for the clinical use of L-carnitine analogs in cardiometabolic disorders|journal=Vascular Health and Risk Management|date=1 January 2011|volume=7|pages=169–176|doi=10.2147/VHRM.S14356|pmc=3072740|issn=1176-6344}}</ref>  Carnitine has no effect on preventing mortality associated with cardiovascular conditions.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shang|first1=Ruiping|last2=Sun|first2=Zhiqi|last3=Li|first3=Hui|title=Effective dosing of L-carnitine in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=BMC Cardiovascular Disorders|date=21 July 2014|volume=14|pages=88|doi=10.1186/1471-2261-14-88|pmid=25044037|issn=1471-2261}}</ref>  Carnitine has no effect on serum lipids, except a possible lowering of [[LDL]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=Haohai|last2=Song|first2=Lijun|last3=Zhang|first3=Hua|last4=Zhang|first4=Hanbin|last5=Zhang|first5=Jiping|last6=Zhao|first6=Wenchang|title=Influence of L-carnitine supplementation on serum lipid profile in hemodialysis patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=Kidney & Blood Pressure Research|date=1 January 2013|volume=38|issue=1|pages=31–41|doi=10.1159/000355751|pmid=24525835|issn=1423-0143}}</ref>  Carnitine has no effect on most parameters in end stage kidney disease, however it possibly has an effect on [[c-reactive protein]].

'''<big>Male infertility</big>'''

The carnitine content of seminal fluid is directly related to sperm count and motility, suggesting that the compound might be of value in treating male infertility. Several studies indicate that carnitine supplementation (2–3 grams/day for 3–4 months) may improve sperm quality, and one randomized, double-blind crossover trial found that 2 grams/day of carnitine taken for 2 months by 100 infertile men increased the concentration and both total and forward motility of their sperm. The reported benefits may relate to increased mitochondrial fatty-acid oxidation (providing more energy for sperm) and reduced cell death in the testes.

===Atherosclerosis===

An important interaction between diet and the intestinal microbiome brings into play additional metabolic factors that aggravate atherosclerosis beyond dietary cholesterol. This may help to explain some benefits of the Mediterranean diet. Hazen’s group from the Cleveland Clinic reported that carnitine<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Koeth|first1=RA|last2=Wang|first2=Z|last3=Levison|first3=BS, et al|title= Intestinal microbiota metabolism of <small>L</small>-carnitine, a nutrient in red meat, promotes atherosclerosis|journal=Nat Med.|date= 2013|volume=19|issue=5|pages=576–85|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3650111}}</ref> from animal flesh (four times as much in red meat as in fish or chicken), as well as phosphatidylcholine from egg yolk, are converted by intestinal bacteria to trimethylamine (the compound that causes uremic breath to smell fishy). Trimethylamine is oxidized in the liver to [[trimethylamine N-oxide|trimethylamine ''N''-oxide]] (TMAO), which causes atherosclerosis in animal models. Patients in the top quartile of TMAO had a 2.5-fold increase in the 3-year risk of stroke, death, or myocardial infarction.

A key issue is that vegans who consumed <small>L</small>-carnitine did not produce TMAO because they did not have the intestinal bacteria that produce TMA from carnitine.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Spence|first1=J.
