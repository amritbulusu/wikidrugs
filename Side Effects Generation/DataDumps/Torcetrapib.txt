'''Torcetrapib''' (CP-529,414, [[Pfizer]]) was a [[medication|drug]] being developed to treat [[hypercholesterolemia]] (elevated [[cholesterol]] levels) and prevent [[cardiovascular disease]]. Its development was halted in 2006 when [[phase III]] studies showed excessive all-cause mortality in the treatment group receiving a combination of [[atorvastatin]] (Lipitor) and torcetrapib.

==Medical uses==
Torcetrapib has not been found to reduce either [[cardiovascular disease]] or risk of death in those already taking a statin drugs.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Keene|first1=D|last2=Price|first2=C|last3=Shun-Shin|first3=MJ|last4=Francis|first4=DP|title=Effect on cardiovascular risk of high density lipoprotein targeted drug treatments niacin, fibrates, and CETP inhibitors: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials including 117,411 patients|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=Jul 18, 2014|volume=349|pages=g4379|pmid=25038074|pmc=4103514|doi=10.1136/bmj.g4379}}</ref>

==Mechanism==
Torcetrapib acts (as a [[CETP inhibitor]]) by inhibiting [[cholesterylester transfer protein]] (CETP), which normally transfers cholesterol from [[High density lipoprotein|HDL cholesterol]] to [[Very low density lipoprotein|very low density]] or [[low density lipoprotein]]s (VLDL or LDL). Inhibition of this process results in higher HDL levels (the "good" cholesterol-containing particle) and reduces LDL levels (the "bad" cholesterol).{{Vague|date=April 2011}}{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Development==
The first step in the synthesis was a recently created reaction of amination to [[p-chlorotrifluoryltoluene]], a reaction that was created by Dr. Stephen Buchwald at MIT.<ref>{{cite web

Development of the drug began around 1990; it was first administered in humans in 1999, and manufacturing at production scale began in Ireland in 2005.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Pfizer Begins Production at Torcetrapib/Atorvastatin Manufacturing Facility |publisher=Pfizer |date=June 22, 2005 |url=http://www.pfizer.com/pfizer/are/investors_releases/2005pr/mn_2005_0622.jsp |accessdate=2006-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205085131/http://www.pfizer.com/pfizer/are/investors_releases/2005pr/mn_2005_0622.jsp |archivedate=2006-12-05 |df= }}</ref>

Pfizer had previously announced that torcetrapib would be sold in combination with Pfizer's [[statin]], [[atorvastatin]] (Lipitor); however, following media and physician criticism, Pfizer had subsequently planned for torcetrapib to be sold independently of Lipitor.<ref>{{cite news | first = Alex | last = Berenson | title = Heart Pill to Be Sold by Itself | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/26/business/26drug.html | work = Business | publisher = The New York Times | date = July 26, 2006 | accessdate = 2006-12-03}}</ref>

==Clinical trials==
A 2004 trial (19 subjects, non-randomised) showed that torcetrapib could increase HDL and lower LDL with and without an added statin.<ref>{{cite journal

==Synthesis==
Dietary cholesterol needs be esterified in order to be absorbed from the gut. The enzyme, [[cholesterylester transfer protein]] (CETP), then completes the absorption of [[cholesterol]]. Drugs that interfere with the action of these peptides would aid in lowering cholesterol levels by complementing the action of the [[statins]] that inhibit the endogenous production of cholesterol. The CETP inhibitor torcetrapib ('''8''') proved very effective in lowering cholesterol levels in humans; the drug not only lowered low-density lipoproteins (LDL and VLDL) but also raised levels of high density, “good” lipoproteins ([[High-density lipoprotein|HDL]]). This agent, which had only a brief time on the market due to adverse safety reports, is included here to illustrate an unusual method for preparing tetrahydroquinolines.

Reaction of the trifluoromethylaniline ('''1''') with [[propanal]] in the presence of [[benzotriazole]] ('''2''') affords the aminal ('''3'''). Condensation of ('''3''') with the vinyl carbamate ('''4''') yields the [[tetrahydroquinoline]] ring ('''5''') with expulsion of the [[benzotriazole]] fragment. The ring nitrogen is then protected as its [[ethyl carbamate]] by acylation with [[ethyl chloroformate]] ('''6'''). The benzyl carbamate function on nitrogen at the 4 position is next removed by reduction with [[ammonium formate]] over [[palladium]] to afford the primary amine; this compound is then resolved as its dibenzyl tartrate salt to afford the 2R,4S isomer ('''7'''). Reductive amination with the bis-trifuoromethyl benzaldehyde in the presence of [[sodium triacetoxyborohydride]] followed by acylation with methyl chloroformate completes the synthesis of torcetrapib ('''8''').
