===Neural sources===
In the [[hypothalamus]], oxytocin is made in [[magnocellular neurosecretory cell]]s of the [[supraoptic nucleus|supraoptic]] and [[paraventricular nucleus|paraventricular]] nuclei, and is stored in [[Herring bodies]] at the axon terminals in the posterior pituitary. It is then released into the blood from the [[posterior pituitary|posterior lobe]] ([[neurohypophysis]]) of the [[pituitary gland]]. These [[axons]] (likely, but [[dendrites]] have not been ruled out) have collaterals that innervate neurons in the [[nucleus accumbens]], a brain structure where oxytocin receptors are expressed.<ref name="Ross">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ross HE, Cole CD, Smith Y, Neumann ID, Landgraf R, Murphy AZ, Young LJ | title = Characterization of the oxytocin system regulating affiliative behavior in female prairie voles | journal = Neuroscience | volume = 162 | issue = 4 | pages = 892–903 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19482070 | pmc = 2744157 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2009.05.055 }}</ref> The [[endocrine system|endocrine]] effects of hormonal oxytocin and the cognitive or behavioral effects of oxytocin [[neuropeptide]]s are thought to be coordinated through its common release through these collaterals.<ref name="Ross"/> Oxytocin is also produced by some neurons in the paraventricular nucleus that project to other parts of the brain and to the spinal cord.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Landgraf R, Neumann ID | title = Vasopressin and oxytocin release within the brain: a dynamic concept of multiple and variable modes of neuropeptide communication | journal = Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology | volume = 25 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 150–76 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15589267 | doi = 10.1016/j.yfrne.2004.05.001 }}</ref> Depending on the species, oxytocin receptor-expressing cells are located in other areas, including the [[amygdala]] and [[Bed nucleus of the stria terminalis|bed nucleus]] of the [[stria terminalis]].

In the [[pituitary gland]], oxytocin is packaged in large, dense-core vesicles, where it is bound to [[neurophysin I]] as shown in the inset of the figure; neurophysin is a large [[peptide]] fragment of the larger precursor [[protein]] molecule from which oxytocin is derived by [[enzyme|enzymatic]] cleavage.

Secretion of oxytocin from the neurosecretory nerve endings is regulated by the electrical activity of the oxytocin cells in the hypothalamus. These cells generate [[action potential]]s that propagate down [[axon]]s to the nerve endings in the pituitary; the endings contain large numbers of oxytocin-containing vesicles, which are released by [[exocytosis]] when the nerve terminals are depolarised.

====Male====
The [[Leydig cells]] in some species have been shown to possess the biosynthetic machinery to manufacture testicular oxytocin ''de novo'', to be specific, in rats (which can synthesize vitamin C endogenously), and in guinea pigs, which, like humans, require an exogenous source of vitamin C (ascorbate) in their diets.<ref name="pmid1456839">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kukucka MA, Misra HP | title = HPLC determination of an oxytocin-like peptide produced by isolated guinea pig Leydig cells: stimulation by ascorbate | journal = Archives of Andrology | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 185–90 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1456839 | doi = 10.3109/01485019208987723 | url = http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/01485019208987723 }}</ref>

====Female====
Oxytocin is synthesized by [[corpora lutea]] of several species, including ruminants and primates. Along with estrogen, it is involved in inducing the endometrial synthesis of [[prostaglandin F2alpha|prostaglandin&nbsp;F<sub>2α</sub>]] to cause regression of the corpus luteum.

===Evolution===
Virtually all [[vertebrate]]s have an oxytocin-like [[nonapeptide]] hormone that supports reproductive functions and a vasopressin-like nonapeptide hormone involved in water regulation. The two genes are usually located close to each other (less than 15,000 bases apart) on the same [[chromosome]], and are transcribed in opposite directions (however, in [[fugu]],<ref name="pmid9356472">{{cite journal | vauthors = Venkatesh B, Si-Hoe SL, Murphy D, Brenner S | title = Transgenic rats reveal functional conservation of regulatory controls between the Fugu isotocin and rat oxytocin genes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 94 | issue = 23 | pages = 12462–6 | date = November 1997 | pmid = 9356472 | pmc = 25001 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.94.23.12462 | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9356472 }}</ref> the homologs are further apart and transcribed in the same direction).

Oxytocin has peripheral (hormonal) actions, and also has actions in the brain. Its actions are mediated by specific, [[oxytocin receptor]]s. The oxytocin receptor is a [[G-protein-coupled receptor]] that requires [[magnesium]] and [[cholesterol]]. It belongs to the [[rhodopsin]]-type (class I) group of G-protein-coupled receptors.

Studies have looked at oxytocin's role in various behaviors, including [[orgasm]], [[social recognition]], [[pair bond]]ing, [[anxiety]], and maternal behaviors.<ref name="pmid19482229">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee HJ, Macbeth AH, Pagani JH, Young WS | title = Oxytocin: the great facilitator of life | journal = Progress in Neurobiology | volume = 88 | issue = 2 | pages = 127–51 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19482229 | pmc = 2689929 | doi = 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2009.04.001 }}</ref>

===Physiological{{anchor|Actions within the brain}}===
The [[peripheral]] actions of oxytocin mainly reflect secretion from the [[pituitary gland]]. The behavioral effects of oxytocin are thought to reflect release from centrally projecting oxytocin neurons, different from those that project to the [[pituitary gland]], or that are collaterals from them.<ref name="Ross"/> Oxytocin receptors are expressed by neurons in many parts of the brain and spinal cord, including the [[amygdala]], [[ventromedial hypothalamus]], [[septum]], [[nucleus accumbens]], and [[brainstem]].

* [[Lactation#Milk ejection reflex|Milk ejection reflex]]/Letdown reflex: In [[lactation|lactating]] ([[breastfeeding]]) mothers, oxytocin acts at the [[mammary gland]]s, causing milk to be 'let down' into [[areola|subareolar]] [[sinuses]], from where it can be excreted via the [[nipple]].<ref>{{EMedicine|article|976504|Human Milk and Lactation}}</ref> Suckling by the [[infant]] at the [[nipple]] is relayed by [[spinal nerves]] to the [[hypothalamus]]. The [[stimulation]] causes [[neurons]] that make oxytocin to fire action potentials in intermittent bursts; these bursts result in the secretion of pulses of oxytocin from the neurosecretory [[axon terminal|nerve terminals]] of the pituitary gland.
* [[Uterine contraction]]: Important for [[cervical dilation]] before birth, oxytocin causes contractions during the second and third stages of [[labor (childbirth)|labor]].<ref name="MacGill">{{cite web|last1=MacGill|first1=Markus|title=What is oxytocin, and what does it do?|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/275795.php|website=Medical News Today|publisher=Heath Line Media|accessdate=March 29, 2017}}</ref> Oxytocin release during [[breastfeeding]] causes mild but often painful [[Muscle contraction|contraction]]s during the first few weeks of lactation. This also serves to assist the uterus in clotting the placental attachment point postpartum. However, in [[knockout mouse|knockout mice]] lacking the oxytocin receptor, reproductive [[behavior]] and [[parturition]] are normal.<ref name="Takayanagi">{{cite journal | vauthors = Takayanagi Y, Yoshida M, Bielsky IF, Ross HE, Kawamata M, Onaka T, Yanagisawa T, Kimura T, Matzuk MM, Young LJ, Nishimori K | title = Pervasive social deficits, but normal parturition, in oxytocin receptor-deficient mice | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | issue = 44 | pages = 16096–101 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16249339 | pmc = 1276060 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0505312102 }}</ref>
* Due to its similarity to [[vasopressin]], it can reduce the excretion of [[urine]] slightly. In several species, oxytocin can stimulate sodium excretion from the kidneys (natriuresis), and, in humans, high doses can result in low sodium levels ([[hyponatremia]]).
* Cardiac effects: Oxytocin and oxytocin receptors are also found in the [[heart]] in some rodents, and the hormone may play a role in the embryonal development of the heart by promoting [[cardiomyocyte]] differentiation.<ref name="pmid12093924">{{cite journal | vauthors = Paquin J, Danalache BA, Jankowski M, McCann SM, Gutkowska J | title = Oxytocin induces differentiation of P19 embryonic stem cells to cardiomyocytes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 99 | issue = 14 | pages = 9550–5 | date = July 2002 | pmid = 12093924 | pmc = 123178 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.152302499 }}</ref><ref name="pmid15316117">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jankowski M, Danalache B, Wang D, Bhat P, Hajjar F, Marcinkiewicz M, Paquin J, McCann SM, Gutkowska J | title = Oxytocin in cardiac ontogeny | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 101 | issue = 35 | pages = 13074–9 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15316117 | pmc = 516519 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0405324101 }}</ref> However, the absence of either oxytocin or its receptor in knockout mice has not been reported to produce cardiac insufficiencies.<ref name="Takayanagi" />
* Modulation of [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] activity: Oxytocin, under certain circumstances, indirectly inhibits release of [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] and [[cortisol]] and, in those situations, may be considered an antagonist of vasopressin.<ref name="isbn83-200-1415-8">{{cite book | vauthors = Hartwig W | title = Endokrynologia praktyczna | publisher = Państwowy Zakład Wydawnictw Lekarskich  | location = [[Warsaw]] | year = 1989 | isbn = 83-200-1415-8 }}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>
* Preparing fetal neurons for delivery: Crossing the placenta, maternal oxytocin reaches the fetal brain and induces a switch in the action of neurotransmitter [[GABA]] from excitatory to inhibitory on fetal cortical neurons. This silences the fetal brain for the period of delivery and reduces its vulnerability to [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxic damage]].<ref name="pmid17170309">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tyzio R, Cossart R, Khalilov I, Minlebaev M, Hübner CA, Represa A, Ben-Ari Y, Khazipov R | title = Maternal oxytocin triggers a transient inhibitory switch in GABA signaling in the fetal brain during delivery | journal = Science | volume = 314 | issue = 5806 | pages = 1788–92 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17170309 | doi = 10.1126/science.1133212 }}</ref>
*Feeding: A 2012 paper suggested that oxytocin neurons in the para-ventricular hypothalamus in the brain may play a key role in suppressing appetite under normal conditions and that other hypothalamic neurons may trigger eating via inhibition of these oxytocin neurons. This population of oxytocin neurons are absent in [[Prader-Willi syndrome]], a genetic disorder that leads to uncontrollable feeding and obesity, and may play a key role in its pathophysiology.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Atasoy D, Betley JN, Su HH, Sternson SM | title = Deconstruction of a neural circuit for hunger | journal = Nature | volume = 488 | issue = 7410 | pages = 172–7 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22801496 | doi = 10.1038/nature11270 | pmc=3416931}}</ref>

===Psychological===
* Autism: Oxytocin has been implicated in the etiology of autism, with one report suggesting autism is correlated with genomic deletion of the gene containing the oxytocin receptor gene ([[Oxytocin receptor|''OXTR'']]). Studies involving Caucasian and Finnish samples and Chinese Han families provide support for the relationship of ''OXTR'' with autism.<ref name="Gregory2009">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jacob S, Brune CW, Carter CS, Leventhal BL, Lord C, Cook EH | title = Association of the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) in Caucasian children and adolescents with autism | journal = Neuroscience Letters | volume = 417 | issue = 1 | pages = 6–9 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17383819 | pmc = 2705963 | doi = 10.1016/j.neulet.2007.02.001 }}</ref><ref name="Wermter2009">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wermter AK, Kamp-Becker I, Hesse P, Schulte-Körne G, Strauch K, Remschmidt H | title = Evidence for the involvement of genetic variation in the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) in the etiology of autistic disorders on high-functioning level | journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics.

====Bonding====
In the [[prairie vole]], oxytocin released into the brain of the female during sexual activity is important for forming a pair bond with her sexual partner. [[Vasopressin]] appears to have a similar effect in males.<ref>[http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/high-on-fidelity Vacek M, High on Fidelity. What can voles teach us about monogamy? ]</ref> Oxytocin has a role in social behaviors in many species, so it likely also does in humans. In a 2003 study, both humans and dog oxytocin levels in the blood rose after five to 24 minutes of a petting session. This possibly plays a role in the [[human-canine bond|emotional bonding between humans and dogs]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=VO6dp52RxnQC&oi=fnd&pg=PR5&dq=oxytocin+petting+dog&ots=mTRRd4zj_9&sig=5xIdHdfrvmOOmZJh0Eak_KgYl2w#v=onepage&q=%20petting%20dog&f=false Kuchinskas Susan, The Chemistry of Connection: How the Oxytocin Response Can Help You Find Trust, Intimacy, and Love p65]</ref>

* [[Maternal bond|Maternal behavior]]: Female rats given oxytocin [[Receptor antagonist|antagonists]] after giving birth do not exhibit typical maternal behavior.<ref name="pmid3819639">{{cite journal | vauthors = van Leengoed E, Kerker E, Swanson HH | title = Inhibition of post-partum maternal behaviour in the rat by injecting an oxytocin antagonist into the cerebral ventricles | journal = The Journal of Endocrinology | volume = 112 | issue = 2 | pages = 275–82 | date = February 1987 | pmid = 3819639 | doi = 10.1677/joe.0.1120275 }}</ref> By contrast, virgin female sheep show maternal behavior toward foreign lambs upon [[cerebrospinal fluid]] infusion of oxytocin, which they would not do otherwise.<ref name="urlBritish Society for Neuroendocrinology – 22.

* [[Ingroup]] bonding: Oxytocin can increase positive attitudes, such as bonding, toward individuals with similar characteristics, who then become classified as "in-group" members, whereas individuals who are dissimilar become classified as "out-group" members. Race can be used as an example of in-group and out-group tendencies because society often categorizes individuals into groups based on race (Caucasian, African American, Latino, etc.). One study that examined race and [[empathy]] found that participants receiving nasally administered oxytocin had stronger reactions to pictures of in-group members making pained faces than to pictures of out-group members with the same expression.<ref name="pmid23246533">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sheng F, Liu Y, Zhou B, Zhou W, Han S | title = Oxytocin modulates the racial bias in neural responses to others' suffering | journal = Biological Psychology | volume = 92 | issue = 2 | pages = 380–6 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23246533 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2012.11.018 }}</ref> This shows that oxytocin may be implicated in our ability to empathize with individuals of different races and could potentially translate into willingness to help individuals in pain or stressful situations. Moreover, individuals of one race may be more inclined to help individuals of the same race than individuals of another race when they are experiencing pain. Oxytocin has also been implicated in [[Lie|lying]] when lying would prove beneficial to other in-group members. In a study where such a relationship was examined, it was found that when individuals were administered oxytocin, rates of [[dishonesty]] in the participants' responses increased for their in-group members when a beneficial outcome for their group was expected.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shalvi S, De Dreu CK | title = Oxytocin promotes group-serving dishonesty | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 15 | pages = 5503–7 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24706799 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1400724111 | pmc=3992689}}</ref> Both of these examples show the tendency to act in ways that benefit people with which one feels is part of their social group, or in-group. Oxytocin is not only correlated with the preferences of individuals to associate with members of their own group, but it is also evident during conflicts between members of different groups.  During conflict, individuals receiving nasally administered oxytocin demonstrate more frequent defense-motivated responses toward in-group members than out-group members. Further, oxytocin was correlated with participant desire to protect vulnerable in-group members, despite that individual's attachment to the conflict.<ref name="pmid23144787">{{cite journal | vauthors = De Dreu CK, Shalvi S, Greer LL, Van Kleef GA, Handgraaf MJ | title = Oxytocin motivates non-cooperation in intergroup conflict to protect vulnerable in-group members | journal = PloS One | volume = 7 | issue = 11 | pages = e46751 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23144787 | pmc = 3492361 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0046751 }}</ref> Similarly, it has been demonstrated that when oxytocin is administered, individuals alter their subjective preferences in order to align with in-group ideals over out-group ideals.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Stallen M, De Dreu CK, Shalvi S, Smidts A, Sanfey AG | title = The herding hormone: oxytocin stimulates in-group conformity | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 23 | issue = 11 | pages = 1288–92 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22991128 | doi = 10.1177/0956797612446026 }}</ref> These studies demonstrate that oxytocin is associated with intergroup dynamics.  Further, oxytocin influences the responses of individuals in a particular group to those of another group. The in-group bias is evident in smaller groups; however, it can also be extended to groups as large as one's entire country leading toward a tendency of strong national zeal. A study done in the Netherlands showed that oxytocin increased the in-group favoritism of their nation while decreasing acceptance of members of other ethnicities and foreigners.<ref name="pmid21220339"/> People also show more affection for their country's flag while remaining indifferent to other cultural objects when exposed to oxytocin.<ref name="pmid25140135">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ma X, Luo L, Geng Y, Zhao W, Zhang Q, Kendrick KM | title = Oxytocin increases liking for a country's people and national flag but not for other cultural symbols or consumer products | journal = Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience | volume = 8 | issue =  | pages = 266 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25140135 | pmc = 4122242 | doi = 10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00266 }}</ref> It has thus been hypothesized that this hormone may be a factor in [[xenophobic]] tendencies secondary to this effect.  Thus, oxytocin appears to affect individuals at an international level where the in-group becomes a specific "home" country and the out-group grows to include all other countries.

====Drugs====
* [[Drug interaction]] Impact on effects of alcohol and other drugs: According to several studies in animals, oxytocin inhibits the development of tolerance to various addictive drugs ([[opiate]]s, [[cocaine]], [[ethanol|alcohol]]), and reduces [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms.<ref name="pmid9924746">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kovács GL, Sarnyai Z, Szabó G | title = Oxytocin and addiction: a review | journal = Psychoneuroendocrinology | volume = 23 | issue = 8 | pages = 945–62 | date = November 1998 | pmid = 9924746 | doi = 10.1016/S0306-4530(98)00064-X }}</ref> [[MDMA]] (ecstasy) may increase feelings of love, empathy, and connection to others by stimulating oxytocin activity primarily via activation of [[serotonin]] [[5-HT1A receptor]]s, if initial studies in animals apply to humans.<ref name="pmid17383105">{{cite journal | vauthors = Thompson MR, Callaghan PD, Hunt GE, Cornish JL, McGregor IS | title = A role for oxytocin and 5-HT(1A) receptors in the prosocial effects of 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine ("ecstasy") | journal = Neuroscience | volume = 146 | issue = 2 | pages = 509–14 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17383105 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2007.02.032 }}</ref> The [[anxiolytic]] [[Buspar]] (buspirone) may produce some of its effects via 5-HT1A receptor-induced oxytocin stimulation as well.<ref name="pmid9025112">{{cite journal | vauthors = Uvnäs-Moberg K, Hillegaart V, Alster P, Ahlenius S | title = Effects of 5-HT agonists, selective for different receptor subtypes, on oxytocin, CCK, gastrin and somatostatin plasma levels in the rat | journal = Neuropharmacology | volume = 35 | issue = 11 | pages = 1635–40 | year = 1996 | pmid = 9025112 | doi = 10.1016/S0028-3908(96)00078-0 }}</ref><ref name="pmid8771561">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chiodera P, Volpi R, Capretti L, Caffarri G, Magotti MG, Coiro V | title = Different effects of the serotonergic agonists buspirone and sumatriptan on the posterior pituitary hormonal responses to hypoglycemia in humans | journal = Neuropeptides | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = April 1996 | pmid = 8771561 | doi = 10.1016/S0143-4179(96)90086-4 }}</ref>
* [[Addiction vulnerability]] Endogenous oxytocin can also impact on drug effects and susceptibility to develop [[Substance use disorder]]. Endogenous oxytocin concentrations can directly impact on drug effects. Additionally, bilateral interactions with numerous systems, including the [[dopamine]] system, [[Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis]] and [[immune system]], can impact on development of dependence. The status of the endogenous oxytocin system might enhance or reduce susceptibility to addiction through its interaction with these systems. Individual differences in the endogenous oxytocin system based on genetic predisposition, gender and environmental influences, may therefore affect [[addiction vulnerability]].<ref name="PBB">{{cite journal | vauthors = Buisman-Pijlman FT, Sumracki NM, Gordon JJ, Hull PR, Carter CS, Tops M | title = Individual differences underlying susceptibility to addiction: Role for the endogenous oxytocin system | journal = Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Behavior | volume = 119 | pages = 22–38 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24056025 | doi = 10.1016/j.pbb.2013.09.005 }}</ref> Oxytocin may be related to the [[Conditioned place preference|place conditioning behaviors]] observed in habitual drug abusers.

====Fear and anxiety====
Oxytocin is typically remembered for the effect it has on [[prosocial behavior]]s, such as its role in facilitating trust and attachment between individuals.

The biologically active form of oxytocin, commonly measured by [[Radioimmunoassay|RIA]] and/or [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] techniques, is also known as the octapeptide "oxytocin disulfide" (oxidized form), but oxytocin also exists as a reduced straight-chain (non-cyclic) [[dithiol]] nonapeptide called oxytoceine.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = du Vigneaud V. | title = Experiences in the Polypeptide Field: Insulin to Oxytocin | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 88 | issue = 3 | pages = 537–48 | year = 1960 | pmid = | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1960.tb20052.x | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119764459/abstract }}</ref> It has been theorized that oxytoceine may act as a [[free radical]] scavenger, as donating an electron to a free radical allows oxytoceine to be re-oxidized to oxytocin via the [[dehydroascorbate]] / [[ascorbate]] redox couple.<ref name="DLA: Mechanisms by which hypoxia augments Leydig cell viability and differentiated cell function in vitro">{{Cite web| url=http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-06062008-170416 | title=Mechanisms by which hypoxia augments Leydig cell viability and differentiated cell function in vitro | author = Kukucka MA | date=1993-04-18 | publisher=Digital Library and Archives | accessdate=2010-02-21}}</ref>

The structure of oxytocin is very similar to that of [[vasopressin]].  Both are nonapeptides with a single disulfide bridge, differing only by two substitutions in the amino acid sequence (differences from oxytocin bolded for clarity): Cys&nbsp;–&nbsp;Tyr&nbsp;–&nbsp;'''[[phenylalanine|Phe]]'''&nbsp;–&nbsp;Gln&nbsp;–&nbsp;Asn&nbsp;–&nbsp;Cys&nbsp;–&nbsp;Pro&nbsp;–&nbsp;'''[[arginine|Arg]]'''&nbsp;–&nbsp;Gly&nbsp;–&nbsp;NH<sub>2</sub>.<ref name = OxytocinVasopressinStructures /> A table showing the sequences of members of the vasopressin/oxytocin superfamily and the species expressing them is present in the [[vasopressin]] article.

Oxytocin and vasopressin are the only known hormones released by the human [[posterior pituitary gland]] to act at a distance. However, oxytocin neurons make other peptides, including [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] and [[dynorphin]], for example, that act locally. The [[magnocellular neurosecretory cell]]s that make oxytocin are adjacent to magnocellular neurosecretory cells that make vasopressin. These are large neuroendocrine neurons which are excitable and can generate action potentials.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Leng|first1=G|last2=Brown|first2=CH |last3=Russell|first3=JA|title=Physiological pathways regulating the activity of magnocellular neurosecretory cells|journal=Progress in neurobiology|date=April 1999|volume=57|issue=6|pages=625–655|doi=10.1016/s0301-0082(98)00072-0|pmid=10221785}}</ref>

== History ==
The word ''oxytocin'' was coined from the term oxytocic. [[Greek language|Greek]] ὀξύς, ''oxys'', and τόκος, ''tokos'', meaning "quick birth")

Its uterine-contracting properties were discovered by British pharmacologist Sir [[Henry Hallett Dale]] in 1906.<ref name= "pmid16992821">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dale HH | title = On some physiological actions of ergot | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 163–206 | date = May 1906 | pmid = 16992821 | pmc = 1465771 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.1906.sp001148 }}</ref><ref name="pmid19482229"/> And its milk ejection property was described by Ott and Scott in 1910<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Ott |first1=I |last2=Scott |first2=JC |title=The Action of Infundibulum upon Mammary Secretion | journal = Proc Soc Exp Biol | year = 1910 | volume = 8 | pages = 48–49 | name-list-format = vanc }}</ref>{{primary-inline|date=March 2017}} and by Schafer and Mackenzie in 1911.<ref name=Schafer_Mackenzie_1911>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schafer EA, Mackenzie K | title = The Action of Animal Extracts on Milk Secretion |journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B |date=July 1911 | volume = 84 | issue = 568 |pages = 16–22 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.1911.0042 }}</ref>{{primary-inline|date=March 2017}}
