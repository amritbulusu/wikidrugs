[[File:Human androgen receptor and androgen binding.svg|thumb|294 px|Normal function of the androgen receptor. Testosterone (T) enters the cell and, if 5-alpha-reductase is present, is converted into dihydrotestone (DHT). Upon steroid binding, the androgen receptor (AR) undergoes a conformational change and releases heat-shock proteins (hsps). Phosphorylation (P) occurs before or after steroid binding. The AR translocates to the nucleus where dimerization, DNA binding, and the recruitment of coactivators occur. Target genes are transcribed (mRNA) and translated into proteins.<ref name="pmid7671849">{{cite journal | vauthors = Quigley CA, De Bellis A, Marschke KB, el-Awady MK, Wilson EM, French FS | title = Androgen receptor defects: historical, clinical, and molecular perspectives | journal = Endocrine Reviews | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 271–321 | date = June 1995 | pmid = 7671849 | doi = 10.1210/edrv-16-3-271 }}</ref><ref name="pmid15705293">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gottlieb B, Lombroso R, Beitel LK, Trifiro MA | title = Molecular pathology of the androgen receptor in male (in)fertility | journal = Reproductive Biomedicine Online | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 42–8 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15705293 | doi = 10.1016/S1472-6483(10)60802-4 }}</ref><ref name="pmid9845666">{{cite journal | vauthors = Choong CS, Wilson EM | title = Trinucleotide repeats in the human androgen receptor: a molecular basis for disease | journal = Journal of Molecular Endocrinology | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 235–57 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 9845666 | doi = 10.1677/jme.0.0210235 }}</ref><ref name="pmid12700055">{{cite journal | vauthors = Meehan KL, Sadar MD | title = Androgens and androgen receptor in prostate and ovarian malignancies | journal = Frontiers in Bioscience | volume = 8 | issue = 1-3 | pages = d780-800 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12700055 | doi = 10.2741/1063 }}</ref>]]

== Function ==

=== Effect on development ===
In some cell types, testosterone interacts directly with androgen receptors, whereas, in others, testosterone is converted by [[5-alpha reductase|5-alpha-reductase]] to dihydrotestosterone, an even more potent [[agonist]] for androgen receptor activation.<ref name="pmid16633980">{{cite journal | vauthors = Davison SL, Bell R | title = Androgen physiology | journal = Seminars in Reproductive Medicine | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 71–7 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16633980 | doi = 10.1055/s-2006-939565 }}</ref>  Testosterone appears to be the primary androgen receptor-activating hormone in the [[Wolffian duct]], whereas dihydrotestosterone is the main androgenic hormone in the [[urogenital sinus]], [[urogenital tubercle]], and [[hair follicle]]s.<ref name="pmid12834017">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sinisi AA, Pasquali D, Notaro A, Bellastella A | title = Sexual differentiation | journal = Journal of Endocrinological Investigation | volume = 26 | issue = 3 Suppl | pages = 23–8 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12834017 | doi =  }}</ref>  Hence, testosterone is responsible primarily for the development of male [[sex organ|primary sexual characteristics]], whereas dihydrotestosterone is responsible for [[secondary sex characteristic|secondary male characteristics]].

Androgens cause slow [[epiphysis]], or maturation of the bones, but more of the potent [[epiphysis]] effect comes from the estrogen produced by [[aromatization]] of androgens. Steroid users of teen age may find that their growth had been stunted by androgen and/or estrogen excess. People with too little sex hormones can be short during puberty but end up taller as adults as in [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]] or [[estrogen insensitivity syndrome]].<ref name="pmid12868122">{{cite journal | vauthors = Frank GR | title = Role of estrogen and androgen in pubertal skeletal physiology | journal = Medical and Pediatric Oncology | volume = 41 | issue = 3 | pages = 217–21 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 12868122 | doi = 10.1002/mpo.10340 }}</ref>

Also, AR [[knockout-mice]] studies have shown that AR is essential for normal female fertility, being required for development and full functionality of the [[ovarian follicle]]s and ovulation, working through both intra-ovarian and neuroendocrine mechanisms.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Walters KA, Simanainen U, Handelsman DJ | title = Molecular insights into androgen actions in male and female reproductive function from androgen receptor knockout models | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 543–58 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20231167 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmq003 }}</ref>

=== Maintenance of male skeletal integrity ===
Via the Androgen receptor, androgens play a key role in the maintenance of male skeletal integrity. The regulation of this integrity by androgen receptor (AR) signaling can be attributed to both osteoblasts and osteocytes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sinnesael M, Claessens F, Laurent M, Dubois V, Boonen S, Deboel L, Vanderschueren D | title = Androgen receptor (AR) in osteocytes is important for the maintenance of male skeletal integrity: evidence from targeted AR disruption in mouse osteocytes | journal = Journal of Bone and Mineral Research | volume = 27 | issue = 12 | pages = 2535–43 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 22836391 | doi = 10.1002/jbmr.1713 }}</ref>

=== Mechanism of action ===

==== Genomic ====
The primary mechanism of action for androgen receptors is direct regulation of [[transcription factor|gene transcription]].  The binding of an [[androgen]] to the androgen receptor results in a conformational change in the receptor that, in turn, causes dissociation of [[heat shock protein]]s, transport from the [[cytosol]] into the [[cell nucleus]], and dimerization.  The androgen receptor dimer binds to a specific sequence of [[DNA]] known as a [[hormone response element]].  Androgen receptors interact with other proteins in the nucleus, resulting in up- or down-regulation of specific [[gene]] [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]].<ref name="pmid17940184">{{cite journal | vauthors = Heemers HV, Tindall DJ | title = Androgen receptor (AR) coregulators: a diversity of functions converging on and regulating the AR transcriptional complex | journal = Endocrine Reviews | volume = 28 | issue = 7 | pages = 778–808 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 17940184 | doi = 10.1210/er.2007-0019 }}</ref>  Up-regulation or activation of transcription results in increased synthesis of [[messenger RNA]], which, in turn, is translated by [[ribosomes]] to produce specific proteins. One of the known target genes of androgen receptor activation is the insulin-like growth factor I receptor ([[IGF-1R]]).<ref name="pmid15753383">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pandini G, Mineo R, Frasca F, Roberts CT, Marcelli M, Vigneri R, Belfiore A | title = Androgens up-regulate the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor in prostate cancer cells | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 65 | issue = 5 | pages = 1849–57 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15753383 | doi = 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1837 }}</ref> Thus, changes in levels of specific proteins in cells is one way that androgen receptors control cell behavior.

One function of androgen receptor that is independent of direct binding to its target DNA sequence, is facilitated by recruitment via other DNA-binding proteins. One example is [[serum response factor]], a protein that activates several genes that cause muscle growth.<ref name="pmid15623502">{{cite journal | vauthors = Vlahopoulos S, Zimmer WE, Jenster G, Belaguli NS, Balk SP, Brinkmann AO, Lanz RB, Zoumpourlis VC, Schwartz RJ | title = Recruitment of the androgen receptor via serum response factor facilitates expression of a myogenic gene | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 280 | issue = 9 | pages = 7786–92 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15623502 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M413992200 }}</ref>

==== Non-genomic ====
More recently, androgen receptors have been shown to have a second mode of action. As has been also found for other steroid hormone receptors such as [[estrogen receptor]]s, androgen receptors can have actions that are independent of their interactions with DNA.<ref name="pmid12351684"/><ref name="Fix_2004">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fix C, Jordan C, Cano P, Walker WH | title = Testosterone activates mitogen-activated protein kinase and the cAMP response element binding protein transcription factor in Sertoli cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 101 | issue = 30 | pages = 10919–24 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15263086 | pmc = 503720 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0404278101 }}</ref> Androgen receptors interact with certain [[signal transduction]] proteins in the cytoplasm. Androgen binding to cytoplasmic androgen receptors can cause rapid changes in cell function independent of changes in gene transcription, such as changes in [[Ion channel|ion transport]]. Regulation of signal transduction pathways by cytoplasmic androgen receptors can indirectly lead to changes in gene transcription, for example, by leading to phosphorylation of other transcription factors.

===AR deficiencies===
The [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]], formerly known as testicular feminization, is caused by a mutation of the androgen receptor gene located on the X chromosome (locus:Xq11-Xq12).<ref name="pmid8537246">{{cite journal|vauthors=Brown TR |title=Human androgen insensitivity syndrome |journal=Journal of Andrology |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=299–303 |year=1995 |pmid=8537246 |doi= |url=http://www.andrologyjournal.org/cgi/content/abstract/16/4/299 |format=abstract |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724230318/http://www.andrologyjournal.org/cgi/content/abstract/16/4/299 |archivedate=2008-07-24 }}</ref>

=== CAG repeats ===
The AR gene contains CAG repeats which affect receptor function, where fewer repeats leads to increased receptor sensitivity to circulating androgens and more repeats leads to decreased receptor sensitivity. Studies have shown that racial variation in CAG repeats exists, with African-Americans having fewer repeats, Caucasians having an intermediate number of repeats, and Asians having the longest.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sartor O, Zheng Q, Eastham JA | title = Androgen receptor gene CAG repeat length varies in a race-specific fashion in men without prostate cancer | journal = Urology | volume = 53 | issue = 2 | pages = 378–80 | date = February 1999 | pmid = 9933058 | doi=10.1016/s0090-4295(98)00481-6}}</ref> The racial trends in CAG repeats parallels the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer in these groups.
