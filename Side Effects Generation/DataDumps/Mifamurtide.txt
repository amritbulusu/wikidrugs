'''Mifamurtide''' (trade name Mepact, marketed by [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company|Takeda]]) is a drug against [[osteosarcoma]], a kind of bone [[cancer]] mainly affecting children and young adults, which is lethal in about a third of cases. The drug was approved in Europe in March 2009.

== History ==
The drug was invented by [[Ciba-Geigy]] (now [[Novartis]]) in the early 1980s and sold to [[Jenner Biotherapies]] in the 1990s. In 2003, [[IDM Pharma]] bought the rights and developed it further.<ref name="DrugsRD">{{Cite journal

Mifamurtide had already been granted [[orphan drug]] status by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 2001, and the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) followed in 2004. It was approved in the 27 [[European Union]] member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway by a centralized marketing authorization in March 2009. The drug was denied approval by the FDA in 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=251191|title=IDM Pharma's MEPACT (Mifamurtide, L-MTP-PE) Receives Approval in Europe for Treatment of Patients with Non-Metastatic, Resectable Osteosarcoma|date=2009-03-09|publisher=PR Newswire|accessdate=2009-11-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news-medical.net/news/2007/08/28/29154.aspx|title=IDM Pharma receives not approvable letter for Mifamurtide for treatment of osteosarcoma|date=2007-08-28|publisher=The Medical News|accessdate=2009-11-12}}</ref> Mifamurtide has been licensed by the EMA since March, 2009.<ref>{{cite |url=http://www.mepact.net/|title=Mepact for Healthcare Professionals |accessdate=2009-11-12}}</ref>

In a phase-III [[clinical trial]] in about 800 newly diagnosed osteosarcoma patients, mifamurtide was combined with the chemotherapeutic agents [[doxorubicin]] and [[methotrexate]], with or without [[cisplatin]] and [[ifosfamide]]. The [[mortality rate|mortality]] could be lowered by 30% versus chemotherapy plus [[placebo]]. Six years after the treatment, 78% of patients were still alive. This equals an absolute risk reduction of 8% <!-- ([[P-value|p]]=0.03) -->.<ref name="DrugsRD" />

== Adverse effects ==
In a clinical study, mifamurtide was given to 332 subjects (half of whom were under age of 16) and most side effects were found to be mild to moderate in nature. Most patients experience fewer adverse events with subsequent administration.<ref name="PMID18235123">{{Cite journal

== Pharmacokinetics ==
After application of the [[liposomal]] infusion, the drug is cleared from the plasma within minutes and is concentrated in lung, liver, [[spleen]], [[nasopharynx]], and [[thyroid]]. The terminal half-life is 18 hours. In patients receiving a second treatment after 11–12 weeks, no accumulation effects were observed.<ref>{{harv|EMA|2009|p=8}}</ref>

== Pharmacodynamics ==
Mifamurtide is a fully synthetic derivative of [[muramyl dipeptide]] (MDP), the smallest naturally occurring immune stimulatory component of cell walls from ''[[Mycobacterium]]'' species. It has similar immunostimulatory effects as natural MDP with the advantage of a longer half-life in plasma.

[[NOD2]] is a [[pattern recognition receptor]] which is found in several kinds of [[white blood cell]]s, mainly [[monocytes]] and [[macrophages]]. It recognises muramyl dipeptide, a component of the cell wall of [[bacteria]]. Mifamurtide simulates a bacterial infection by binding to NOD2, activating white cells. This results in an increased production of [[TNF-α]], [[interleukin 1]], [[interleukin 6]], [[interleukin 8]], [[interleukin 12]], and other [[cytokine]]s, as well as [[ICAM-1]]. The activated white cells attack cancer cells, but not, at least ''[[in vitro]]'', other cells.<ref>{{harv|EMA|2009|pp=7–8}}</ref>

== Interactions ==
* Theoretical considerations suggest [[calcineurin inhibitor]]s like [[ciclosporin]] and [[tacrolimus]] might interact with mifamurtide because of their effect on macrophages.
* High-dose [[NSAID]]s block the mechanism of mifamurtide ''in vitro''.

Consequently, the combination of mifamurtide with these types of drugs is contraindicated. However, mifamurtide can be coadministered with low doses of NSAIDs. No evidence suggests mifamurtide interacts with the studied chemotherapeutics, or with the [[cytochrome P450]] system.<ref>{{harv|EMA|2009|p=4}}</ref>

== Chemistry ==
[[File:Liposome scheme-en.svg|thumb|Scheme of a liposome formed by phospholipids in an aqueous solution]]
Mifamurtide is muramyl tripeptide phosphatidylethanolamine (MTP-PE), a synthetic analogue of muramyl dipeptide. The side chains of the molecule give it a longer [[elimination half-life]] than the natural substance. The substance is applied encapsulated into [[liposome]]s (L-MTP-PE). Being a [[phospholipid]], it accumulates in the [[lipid bilayer]] of the liposomes in the infusion.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fidler|first=I. J.|title=Efficacy of liposomes containing a lipophilic muramyl dipeptide derivative for activating the tumoricidal properties of alveolar macrophages in vivo|journal=Journal of Immunotherapy|volume=1|issue=1|year=1982|pages=43–55}}</ref>

=== Synthesis ===
One method of synthesis (shown first) is based on [[N,N'-Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide|''N,N'''-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide]] (DCC) assisted [[esterification]] of ''N''-acetylmuramyl-<small>L</small>-alanyl-<small>D</small>-[[isoglutamine|isoglutaminyl]]-<small>L</small>-alanine with [[N-Hydroxysuccinimide|''N''-hydroxysuccinimide]], followed by a condensation with 2-aminoethyl-2,3-di[[Palmitic acid|palmitoyl]]<nowiki>glycerylphosphoric</nowiki> acid in [[triethylamine]] (Et<sub>3</sub>N).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Prous|first1=J.
