'''Cannabicyclohexanol''' ('''CCH''', '''CP 47,497 dimethyloctyl homologue''', '''(C8)-CP 47,497''') is a [[cannabinoid]] receptor agonist drug, developed by [[Pfizer]] in 1979.  On 19 January 2009, the University of Freiburg in Germany announced that an [[analog (chemistry)|analog]] of [[CP 47,497]] was the main active ingredient in the herbal incense product ''[[Spice (drug)|Spice]]'', specifically the 1,1-dimethyloctyl [[Homology (chemistry)|homologue]] of CP 47,497, which is now known as cannabicyclohexanol.<ref>{{cite web | title=Hauptwirkstoff von "Spice" identifiziert | work=University of Freiburg | url=http://www.pr.uni-freiburg.de/pm/2009/pm.2009-01-19.19/ | date=19 March 2009 | accessdate=25 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jms.1558/abstract | title=‘Spice’ and other herbal blends: harmless incense or cannabinoid designer drugs? |author1=Volker Auwärter |author2=Sebastian Dresen |author3=Wolfgang Weinmann |author4=Michael Müller |author5=Michael Pütz |author6=Nerea Ferreirós | journal=Journal of Mass Spectrometry |date=May 2009  | volume=44 | issue=5 | pages=832–837 | doi=10.1002/jms.1558 | pmid=19189348}}</ref><ref name="pmid20117892">{{Cite journal|vauthors=Uchiyama N, Kikura-Hanajiri R, Ogata J, Goda Y |title=Chemical analysis of synthetic cannabinoids as designer drugs in herbal products |journal=Forensic Science International |volume=198 |issue=1-3 |pages=31–8 |date=May 2010 |pmid=20117892 |doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2010.01.004 |url=}}</ref> The 1,1-dimethyloctyl homologue of CP 47,497 is in fact several times more potent than the parent compound,<ref>{{Cite journal |author1=D.

==Enantiomers==
Cannabicyclohexanol has four [[enantiomer]]s, which by analogy with other related cannabinoid compounds can be expected to have widely varying affinity for cannabinoid receptors, and consequently will show considerable variation in potency.<ref>Eric Stern and Didier Lambert. Cannabinoids in Nature and Medicine. Medicinal Chemistry Endeavors around the Phytocannabinoids. pp 5, 130. {{ISBN|978-3-906390-56-7}}</ref> While the (-)-''cis'' enantiomer (-)-cannabicyclohexanol discovered in the original Pfizer research is expected to be the most potent, all four enantiomers have been isolated from illicit samples of this compound, and the properties of the other three enantiomers have not been studied in detail. Most commonly cannabicyclohexanol is encountered as a diastereomeric mix of the two ''cis'' or two ''trans'' isomers in varying ratios, though more rarely a mixture of all four enantiomers has been seen, as well as reasonably enantiopure samples of the most active isomer.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Uchiyama | first1 = N | last2 = Kikura-Hanajiri | first2 = R | last3 = Shoda | first3 = T | last4 = Fukuhara | first4 = K | last5 = Goda | first5 = Y | year = 2011 | title = Isomeric analysis of synthetic cannabinoids detected as designer drugs | url = | journal = Yakugaku Zasshi | volume = 131 | issue = 7| pages = 1141–7 | pmid = 21720146 | doi=10.1248/yakushi.131.1141}}</ref><ref>[http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/system/files/publications/553/2009_Implementation_report_281420.pdf Europol 2009 Annual Report on the implementation of Council Decision 2005/387/JHA]</ref><ref>[http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/system/files/publications/734/EMCDDA-Europol_2012_Annual_Report_final_439477.pdf Europol 2012 Annual Report on the implementation of Council Decision 2005/387/JHA]</ref> Confusion can arise around the naming of these compounds as they can be viewed either as substituted [[phenol]]s or substituted [[cyclohexanol]]s, but this results in different numbering of the rings. Consequently, the active isomer can be named either 2-[(1S,3R)-3-hydroxycyclohexyl]-5-(2-methylnonan-2-yl)phenol or (1R,3S)-3-[2-hydroxy-4-(2-methylnonan-2-yl)phenyl]cyclohexan-1-ol.

==Toxicity==
(C8)-CP 47,497 has been shown to cause DNA damage and inflammation in directly exposed human cells ''in vitro'',<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00204-015-1569-7 | title=Impact of a synthetic cannabinoid (CP-47,497-C8) on protein expression in human cells: evidence for induction of inflammation and DNA damage |author1=Andrea Bileck |author2=Franziska Ferk |author3=Halh Al-Serori |author4=Verena J.

==Legal status==
Cannabicyclohexanol is not listed in the schedules set out by the [[United Nations]]' [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] from 1961 nor their [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]] from 1971,<ref name="UNCPS">[https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/commissions/CND/conventions.html UN International Drug Control Conventions]</ref> so the signatory countries to these international drug control treaties are not required by said treaties to control Cannabicyclohexanol.

===United States===
Cannabicyclohexanol is a [[List_of_Schedule_I_drugs_(US)|Schedule I controlled substance]] in the USA.<ref name="PART 1308 — SCHEDULES OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES - 1308.11 Schedule I">[http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1308/1308_11.htm §1308.11 Schedule I.]</ref>

====Vermont====
Effective January 1, 2016, cannabicyclohexanol is a regulated drug in Vermont designated as a "Hallucinogenic Drug."<ref>[http://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2017/01/REG_regulated-drugs.pdf Vermont DOH - Regulated Drug Rule 2016 .PDF]</ref>
