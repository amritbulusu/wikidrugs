'''Oxeladin''' is a [[cough suppressant]]. It is a highly potent and effective drug used to treat all types of cough of various etiologies.  It is not related to [[opium]] or its derivatives, so treatment with oxeladin is free of risk of [[Substance dependence|dependence]] or [[addiction]]. Oxeladin has none of the [[side effect]]s (such as [[hypnosis]], [[respiratory depression]], [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]], [[constipation]] and [[analgesia]]) which are present when common antitussives, such as [[codeine]] and its derivatives, are used. It may be used at every age, as well as in patients with [[heart disease]], since it has a high level of safety and a great selectivity to act on the [[bulbar]] centre of cough.

==Indications==
Oxeladin is indicated in all types of cough. Besides its [[antitussive]] action, it helps to clear the [[respiratory tract]], since it increases the quantity of [[secretion]] and thins [[bronchial]] secretion.
* [[Irritation|Irritative]] cough
* [[Allergy|Allergic]] cough
* [[wikt:psychogenic|Psychogenic]] cough
* Treatment of cough in patients with heart disease (it has no action upon the [[cardiovascular system]])
* [[Infection|Infectious]] cough: [[tracheitis]], [[bronchitis]], [[pneumonia]]
* Treatment of cough in pre- and post-operative treatment for [[bronchoscopy]]

==Contraindications==
Although [[Congenital abnormality|fetal malformations]] have not been reported, oxeladin should not be used during the first trimester of [[pregnancy]]. Oxeladin is contraindicated in patients with [[MAOI]] therapy.

==Side effects==
Rarely, some patients have reported [[rash]], [[dizziness]], [[sedation]] or mild [[Dyspepsia|digestive disturbances]]. These usually disappear on reducing the dosage or interrupting the treatment.

==Addiction==
Oxeladin differs from common antitussives that cause addiction (such as etilmorphin,<!-- see talk page --> [[codeine]] or its derivatives) in that there is no evidence of risk of addiction or dependence.

==Composition and packaging==
Oxeladin is available as drops, syrup and tablets, providing easier ways of management which will be chosen depending on the age and clinical stage.
===Drops===
Each 1ml (33 drops) contains oxeladin citrate 20&nbsp;mg. The bottle contains 20ml of solution.

===Syrup===
Each 100ml contains oxeladin citrate 200&nbsp;mg. The bottle contains 100ml of syrup.

===Tablets===
Each tablet contains oxeladin citrate 20&nbsp;mg. The box contains 20 tablets in blister packs

==Dosage==
* Children 2-5yrs: 2.5ml-5ml (17 drops) every 4-6 hours
* Children 6-12 yrs: 10ml (33 drops), or 1 tablet, every 4-6 hours
* Children 12 yrs and over and adults: 15ml (50 drops), or 2 tablets, every 4-6 hours

==Restrictions in use and availability==
The Drug and Medical Technology Agency of [[Armenia]] rejected the registration of oxeladin in July 2000 since studies in [[Germany]] have shown potential carcinogenicity of the drug.
