'''Epirubicin'''  is an [[anthracycline]] [[medication|drug]] used for [[chemotherapy]]. It can be used in combination with other medications to treat breast cancer in patients who have had surgery to remove the tumor. It is marketed by [[Pfizer]] under the trade name '''Ellence''' in the US and '''Pharmorubicin''' or '''Epirubicin Ebewe''' elsewhere. 

Similarly to other anthracyclines, epirubicin acts by [[intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalating]] [[DNA]] strands.
Intercalation results in complex formation which inhibits DNA and RNA synthesis. It also triggers DNA cleavage by [[topoisomerase II]], resulting in mechanisms that lead to cell death. Binding to cell membranes and plasma proteins may be involved in the compound's cytotoxic effects. Epirubicin also generates [[free radical]]s that cause cell and DNA damage.

Epirubicin is favoured over [[doxorubicin]], the most popular anthracycline, in some [[chemotherapy regimen]]s as it appears to cause fewer side-effects. Epirubicin has a different spatial orientation of the hydroxyl group at the 4' carbon of the sugar – it has the opposite chirality – which may account for its faster elimination and reduced toxicity. Epirubicin is primarily used against breast and ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, lung cancer and lymphomas. 

==Development history==
The first trial of epirubicin in humans was published in 1980.<ref>

[[Upjohn]] applied for approval by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in node-positive breast cancer in 1984, but was turned down because of lack of data.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.targethealth.com/ontarget/1999/061399.htm |title=On Target |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510100018/http://www.targethealth.com/ontarget/1999/061399.htm |archivedate=2008-05-10 |df= }}</ref> It appears to have been licensed for use in Europe from around this time however.<ref>According to the proprietary database iddb.com</ref> In 1999 [[Pharmacia]] (who had by then merged with Upjohn) received FDA approval for the use of epirubicin as a component of adjuvant therapy in node-positive patients.  

Patent protection for epirubicin expired in August 2007.
