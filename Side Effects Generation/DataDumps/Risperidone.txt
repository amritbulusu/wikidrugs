Studies evaluating the utility of risperidone by mouth for maintenance therapy have reached varying conclusions.

! Summary
|-
|Risperidone seems to produce somewhat more [[Extrapyramidal symptoms|extrapyramidal]] side effects and clearly more prolactin increase than most other [[Atypical antipsychotic|atypical antipsychotics]]. It may also differ from other compounds in the occurrence of other adverse effects such as weight gain, metabolic problems, cardiac effects, sedation and seizures. Nevertheless, the large proportion of participants leaving studies early and incomplete reporting of outcomes makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions.<ref name=Kom2011/>

[[File:Risperidone icon.svg|thumb|right|Risperidone pharmacodynamics excluding <small>D</small>-amino acid oxidase inhibition]]

Risperidone has been classified as a "qualitatively atypical" antipsychotic agent with a relatively low incidence of [[Extrapyramidal symptoms|extrapyramidal side effects]] (when given at low doses) that has more pronounced serotonin antagonism than dopamine antagonism. Risperidone contains the [[functional group]]s of [[benzisoxazole]] and [[piperidine]] as part of its molecular structure. Although not a butyrophenone, it was developed with the structures of [[benperidol]] and [[ketanserin]] as a basis. It has actions at several 5-HT (serotonin) receptor subtypes. These are 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>, linked to weight gain, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, linked to its antipsychotic action and relief of some of the extrapyramidal side effects experienced with the typical neuroleptics.<ref name = "GG">Brunton L, Chabner B, Knollman B. Goodman and Gilman’s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Twelfth Edition. McGraw Hill Professional; 2010.</ref>

It was recently found that [[D-amino acid oxidase|<small>D</small>-amino acid oxidase]], the enzyme that catalyses the breakdown of <small>D</small>-amino acids (e.g. [[D-alanine|<small>D</small>-alanine]] and [[D-serine|<small>D</small>-serine]] — the neurotransmitters) is inhibited by risperidone.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Abou El-Magd RM, Park HK, Kawazoe T, Iwana S, Ono K, Chung SP, Miyano M, Yorita K, Sakai T, Fukui K | title = The effect of risperidone on D-amino acid oxidase activity as a hypothesis for a novel mechanism of action in the treatment of schizophrenia | journal = Journal of Psychopharmacology | volume = 24 | issue = 7 | pages = 1055–1067  | date = July 2010 | pmid = 19329549 | doi = 10.1177/0269881109102644 }}</ref>

Risperidone acts on the following receptors:

'''Dopamine receptors''': This drug is an antagonist of the D<sub>1</sub> (D<sub>1</sub>, and D<sub>5</sub>) as well as the D<sub>2</sub> family (D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub> and D<sub>4</sub>) receptors. This drug has "tight binding" properties, which means it has a long half-life and like other antipsychotics, risperidone blocks the mesolimbic pathway, the prefrontal cortex limbic pathway, and the tuberoinfundibular pathway in the central nervous system. Risperidone may induce extrapyramidal side effects, akathisia and tremors, associated with diminished dopaminergic activity in the [[striatum]]. It can also cause sexual side effects, [[galactorrhoea]], infertility, [[gynecomastia]] and, with chronic use reduced bone mineral density leading to [[Bone fracture|breaks]] all of which are associated with increased prolactin secretion.<ref name = "GG" />

'''Serotonin receptors''': Its action at these receptors may be responsible for its lower extrapyramidal side effect liability (via the 5-HT<sub>2A/2C</sub> receptors) and improved negative symptom control compared to typical antipsychotics such as haloperidol for instance. Its antagonistic actions at the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor may account, in part, for its weight gain liability.

'''Alpha α<sub>1</sub> adrenergic receptors''': This action accounts for its orthostatic hypotensive effects and perhaps some of the sedating effects of risperidone.<ref name = "GG" />

'''Alpha α<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptors''': Perhaps greater positive, negative, affective and cognitive symptom control.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hecht EM, Landy DC | year = 2012 | title = Alpha-2 receptor antagonist add-on therapy in the treatment of schizophrenia; a meta-analysis | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920996411006281 | journal = Schizophrenia Research | volume = 134 | issue = 2–3| pages = 202–6 | doi=10.1016/j.schres.2011.11.030 | pmid=22169246}}</ref>

'''Histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors''': effects on these receptors account for its sedation and reduction in vigilance. This may also lead to drowsiness and weight gain.<ref name = "GG" />

Though this medication possesses similar effects to other typical and atypical antipsychotics, it does not possess an affinity for the [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptors]]. In many respects, this medication can be useful as an "[[acetylcholine]] release-promoter" similar to gastrointestinal drugs such as [[metoclopramide]] and [[cisapride]].

===Pharmacokinetics===
Risperidone undergoes hepatic metabolism and renal excretion. Lower doses are recommended for patients with severe liver and kidney disease.<ref name="FDA Prescribing Info Label" />  The [[active metabolite]] of risperidone, [[paliperidone]], is also used as an antipsychotic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01267|title=The DrugBank database|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117205610/http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01267|archivedate=2011-11-17|df=}}</ref>

===Regulatory status===
Risperidone was approved by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1993 for the treatment of schizophrenia.<ref>

The FDA's decision was based in part on a study of autistic people with severe and enduring problems of violent meltdowns, aggression, and self-injury; risperidone is not recommended for autistic people with mild aggression and explosive behavior without an enduring pattern.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Scahill L | title = How do I decide whether or not to use medication for my child with autism? should I try behavior therapy first? | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 38 | issue = 6 | pages = 1197–8 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18463973 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-008-0573-7 }}</ref>

===Availability===
Janssen's patent on risperidone expired on December 29, 2003, opening the market for cheaper [[Generic drug|generic versions]] from other companies, and Janssen's exclusive marketing rights expired on June 29, 2004 (the result of a pediatric extension). It is available under many brand names worldwide.<ref name=generics/>

Risperidone is available as a tablet, an oral solution, and an ampule, which is a [[depot injection]].<ref name=generics/>

===Lawsuits===
On April 11, 2012, [[Johnson & Johnson]] and its [[subsidiary]] [[Janssen Pharmaceutica|Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc]]. were fined $1.2 billion by Judge [[Timothy Davis Fox]] of the Sixth Division of the Sixth [[Courts of Arkansas|Judicial Circuit]] of the [[Arkansas|U.S. state of Arkansas]].<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-risperdal-arkansas-20120411,0,3974735.story "Companies belittled risks of Risperdal, slapped with huge fine"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412005624/http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-risperdal-arkansas-20120411,0,3974735.story |date=2012-04-12 }}, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 11 April 2012.</ref> The jury found the companies had downplayed multiple risks associated with risperidone (Risperdal).
