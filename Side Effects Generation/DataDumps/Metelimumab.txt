'''Metelimumab''' ('''CAT-192''') is a human [[IgG4]] [[monoclonal antibody]] that neutralizes [[TGF beta 1]] which had been chosen for further development for the treatment of diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis, also known as [[Systemic scleroderma|scleroderma]]. Touted as a drug of the future,<ref>http://journals.prous.com/journals/servlet/xmlxsl/pk_journals.xml_summary_pr?p_JournalId=2&p_RefId=860002&p_IsPs=N</ref> metelimumab was dropped from further development in favour of [[fresolimumab]],<ref name="independent.co.uk">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/cat-may-abandon-skin-drug-after-trial-results-disappoint-569445.html</ref> which is currently being developed by [[Genzyme]].<ref name="genzymeoncology.com">http://www.genzymeoncology.com/onc/research/onc_p_research.asp</ref>

== History ==
Metelimumab was isolated by [[Cambridge Antibody Technology]] (CAT) using its [[phage display]] technology. In 2000, CAT signed a collaborative deal with Genzyme to further develop [[TGF beta]] antibodies.<ref>http://prnwire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/09-28-2000/0001324438&EDATE=</ref><ref>http://www.drugdiscoveryonline.com/article.mvc/Cambridge-Antibody-Genzyme-to-collaborate-on-0001?VNETCOOKIE=NO</ref>

In 2004, CAT and Genzyme revealed that Phase I/II trials of metelimumab for scleroderma showed this antibody to be safe and well tolerated across all dose levels, although no conclusions regarding efficacy of the compound could be made.<ref>http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-693661/CAT-192-is-safe-but.html</ref>

Initial trials targeted the skin condition [[scleroderma]]<ref>http://www.genzymeoncology.com/onc/clinical/trialdetailresults.asp?nct=NCT00043706</ref> but, after some unsuccessful clinical trial results, the product was dropped in favour of fresolimumab,<ref name="independent.co.uk"/> which is currently being developed by Genzyme.<ref name="genzymeoncology.com"/>
