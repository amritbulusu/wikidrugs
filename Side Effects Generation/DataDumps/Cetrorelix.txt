'''Cetrorelix''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]]), or '''cetrorelix acetate''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]], [[Japanese Accepted Name|JAN]]), is an injectable [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist|antagonist]] that is marketed primarily under the brand name '''Cetrotide'''. A [[Organic compound#Synthetic compounds|synthetic]] [[decapeptide]], it is used is used in assisted reproduction to inhibit premature luteinizing hormone surges<ref>http://www.emdserono.com/ms.country.us/en/images/Cetrotide_PI_tcm115_140012.pdf?Version=</ref> The drug works by blocking the action of GnRH upon the pituitary, thus rapidly suppressing the production and action of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) and [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH). In addition, cetrorelix can be used to treat hormone-sensitive cancers of the prostate{{cn|date=January 2016}} and breast (in pre-/perimenopausal women){{cn|date=January 2016}} and some benign gynaecological disorders (endometriosis, uterine fibroids and endometrial thinning).{{cn|date=January 2016}} It is administered as either multiple 0.25&nbsp;mg daily subcutaneous injections or as a single-dose 3&nbsp;mg subcutaneous injection.  The duration of the 3&nbsp;mg single dose is four days; if [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG) is not administered within four days, a daily 0.25&nbsp;mg dose is started and continued until hCG is administered.

==Use in IVF==
Cetrorelix is marketed by [[Merck Serono]] for use in [[in-vitro fertilization]] in all countries except Japan, where it is marketed by [[Shionogi]] and [[Nippon Kayaku]].<ref>[http://www.aezsinc.com/en/page.php?p=20&prod=43 Aeternia Zentaris product page]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Aeterna Zentaris receives royalties on these sales and retains rights to develop cetrorelix for other indications. In IVF use it is injected daily after follicle stimulation has been initiated and evidence of follicle maturation is approaching; given daily it prevents an endogenous LH surge that would trigger an untimely ovulation prior to the [[Human chorionic gonadotropin|hCG]] administration by the treating physician. As an alternative to the GnRH antagonist, also a [[GnRH agonist]] could be given, but agonist have to be started earlier to overcome the agonistic effect. Cetrorelix can be mixed with [[follitropin alpha]] without compromising their reported safety and efficacy.<ref>{{Cite journal| journal = Fertility and Sterility| title = Safety and efficacy of mixing cetrorelix with follitropin alfa: a randomized study | first7 = C.| last7 = Tzeng| volume = 94| issue = 1| doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.02.062| pmid = 19339001| year = 2010| pages = 179â€“183 | first6 = J.| last6 = Hwang| last3 = Chang | first2 = Y.| last2 = Wen | first1 = Y. | first3 = Y.| last4 = Seow | first5 = B.| last5 = Hsieh | first4 = K.| last1 = Lin}}</ref>

==Implications==
Over a period of 3 weeks, daily injections of cetrorelix were administered to 12 men in order to suppress testosterone levels. Testosterone levels were significantly suppressed as compared to a control group. During this time of suppression, increases in [[high density lipoprotein]]s (HDLs) were seen. HDLs are responsible for removing cholesterol from the blood and higher amounts are correlated with increased cardivascular health.<ref>{{cite journal | author = von Eckardstein, A | title = Suppression of Endogenous Testosterone in Young Men Increases Serum Levels of High Density Lipoprotein Subclass Lipoprotein A-I and Lipoprotein(a) | journal = Journal of Clinical Endocrinology | volume = 82 | issue = 10 | date = 1997 | pages = 3367}}</ref>

==Contraindications==
The use of cetrorelix is contraindicated in severe renal impairment.  It is not intended for women aged 65 years or older.  Use in women with severe allergic conditions is not recommended.  Use with caution in women with active allergies or history of allergies.
