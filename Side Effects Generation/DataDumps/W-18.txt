'''W-18''' is a compound in a series of 32 substances (named W-1 to W-32) that were first synthesized in academic research on [[analgesic]] [[drug discovery]] in the 1980s and appeared as a [[designer drug]] in the 2010s.  

W-18 was invented at the [[University of Alberta]] by a lab working on [[analgesic]] [[drug discovery]] in the 1980s, and preliminary studies in animals showed it had pain-killing activity in mice.<ref name=forbes>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidkroll/2016/04/30/w-18-the-high-potency-research-chemical-making-news-what-it-is-and-what-it-isnt/#2b1ef5562354|title=W-18, The High-Potency Research Chemical Making News: What It Is And What It Isn't|date=30 April 2016|author=Kroll, David|publisher=Forbes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/street-drug-w-18-is-highly-lethal-and-still-legal-1.3546094|title=Street drug W-18 is highly lethal, and still legal|publisher=CBC News|date=21 April 2016|accessdate=20 April 2016|author=Warnica, Marion}}</ref>

* In Sweden, W-18 was made illegal in January 2016.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/nyheter-och-press/nyhetsarkiv/2015/november/31-nya-amnen-kan-klassas-som-narkotika-eller-halsofarlig-vara/ | title=31 nya ämnen kan klassas som narkotika eller hälsofarlig vara | publisher=Folkhälsomyndigheten | language=Swedish | date=November 2015}}</ref>
* In Canada, W-18 and its analogues were made Schedule I controlled substances.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2016/2016-06-01/html/sor-dors106-eng.php | title=Regulations Amending the Food and Drug Regulations (Parts G and J — Lefetamine, AH-7921, MT-45 and W-18) | author=Denis Arsenault | journal=Canada Gazette | date=1 June 2016 | volume=150 | issue=11 | publisher=Government of Canada}}</ref> Possession without legal authority can result in maximum 7 years imprisonment. Further, [[Health Canada]] amended the ''Food and Drug Regulations'' in May, 2016 to classify W-18 as a restricted drug. Only those with a law enforcement agency, person with an exemption permit or institutions with Minister's authorization may possess the drug.
