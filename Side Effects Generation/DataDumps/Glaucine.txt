==Stereoisomerism==
The (S)-form of the Glaucine occurs in nature and the (R)-form doesn´t.

== Mechanism of action ==
Glaucine binds to the [[benzothiazepine]] site on [[L-type calcium channels|L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channels]], thereby blocking calcium ion channels in [[smooth muscle]] like the human [[bronchus]]. Glaucine has no effect on intracellular calcium stores, but rather, does not allow the entry of Ca<sup>2+</sup> after intracellular stores have been depleted.<ref name="Missingor" /> Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is a vital component in the process of muscular contraction, and the blocking of this influx therefore reduces the ability of the muscle to contract.<ref>Nestler E, Hyman S & Malenka R. Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience (2nd ed.). China: McGraw-Hill Companies.</ref> In this way, glaucine can prevent smooth muscle from contracting, allowing it to relax.

Glaucine has also been demonstrated to be a [[dopamine receptor]] [[antagonist]], favoring D1 and D1-like receptors.<ref name="Missingor_a" /><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 15862999 | year = 2005 | last1 = Asencio | first1 = M | last2 = Hurtado-Guzmán | first2 = C | last3 = López | first3 = JJ | last4 = Cassels | first4 = BK | last5 = Protais | first5 = P | last6 = Chagraoui | first6 = A | title = Structure-affinity relationships of halogenated predicentrine and glaucine derivatives at D1 and D2 dopaminergic receptors: Halogenation and D1 receptor selectivity | volume = 13 | issue = 11 | pages = 3699–704 | doi = 10.1016/j.bmc.2005.03.022 | journal = Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry}}</ref> It is also a [[Non-competitive inhibition|non-competitive selective inhibitor]] of PDE4 in human bronchial tissue and [[granulocytes]]. PDE4 is an [[isoenzyme]] that hydrolyzes [[cyclic AMP]] to regulate human bronchial tone (along with PDE3). Yet as a [[PDE4 inhibitor]], glaucine possesses very low [[Potency (pharmacology)|potency]].<ref name="Missingor" />

== Clinical use ==
It is currently used as an [[antitussive]] agent in  [[Iceland]], as well as [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Russia]] and other eastern European countries.<ref name="Missingor" /><ref name="Missingor_a" /> Bulgarian pharmaceutical company Sopharma sells glaucine in tablet form, where a single dose contains 40&nbsp;mg and the [[Biological half-life|half-life]] is indicated to be 6–8 hours. When ingested [[oral administration|orally]] has been shown to increase [[Airway resistance|airway conductance]] in humans, and has been investigated as a treatment for [[asthma]].<ref name="Missingor" />

Animal studies demonstrate the ability of glaucine to decrease heart rate and lower [[blood pressure]],<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 7606346 | year = 1995 | last1 = Orallo | first1 = F | last2 = Fernández Alzueta | first2 = A | last3 = Campos-Toimil | first3 = M | last4 = Calleja | first4 = JM | title = Study of the in vivo and in vitro cardiovascular effects of (+)-glaucine and N-carbethoxysecoglaucine in rats | volume = 114 | issue = 7 | pages = 1419–27 | pmc = 1510273 | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | doi=10.1111/j.1476-5381.1995.tb13364.x}}</ref> presumably by the same mechanism of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel antagonism that it uses to relax bronchial muscle. Studies of the effect of several alkaloids in mice, including glaucine, demonstrate [[anticonvulsant]] and [[antinociceptive]] properties.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 2907279 | year = 1988 | last1 = Zetler | first1 = G | title = Neuroleptic-like, anticonvulsant and antinociceptive effects of aporphine alkaloids: Bulbocapnine, corytuberine, boldine and glaucine | volume = 296 | pages = 255–81 | journal = Archives Internationales de Pharmacodynamie et de Thérapie}}</ref> In other words; animal studies indicate that glaucine can also act as a pain reliever to a certain extent, although its capacities in this respect appear limited when compared to other [[analgesic]]s.

== Symptoms and recreational use ==
Reports of recreational use of glaucine have recently been published, and effects include dissociative-type symptoms; feeling detached and ‘in another world’, as well as nausea, vomiting and dilated pupils. These reports mirror those about the effects of clinical use, which state dissociative-type symptoms as well as lethargy, fatigue, hallucinations.<ref name="Missingor_b" /><ref name="Missingor_a" /> Investigation of side effects in a clinical setting also reports that the hallucinatory effects manifest as bright and colorful visualizations. They also report that patients perceive their environments clearly yet feel detached from it; “the patient sees and understands everything and is oriented well enough, but cannot take a clear and adequate action”.<ref name="Missingor_b" />

One particular report of recreational use gone awry described the form of distribution as tablets being marketed as a [[Benzylpiperazine|1-benzylpiperazine (BZP)]]-free “herbal high” which the patient referred to as “head candy”.<ref name="Missingor_a" />
