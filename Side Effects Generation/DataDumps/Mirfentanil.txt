'''Mirfentanil''' is a [[fentanyl]] derivative with strong selectivity for the [[mu opioid receptor|μ opioid receptor]]. At lower doses, it antagonizes the [[analgesic]] effects of [[alfentanil]] and substitutes for [[naloxone]] in [[morphine]]-treated monkeys; however, it also reverses naloxone-precipitated [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] in pigeons trained to discriminate morphine from naloxone.<ref name="France 1991">{{cite journal | last1 = France | first1 = CP | last2 = Winger | first2 = G | last3 = Medzihradsky | first3 = F | last4 = Seggel | first4 = MR | last5 = Rice | first5 = KC | last6 = Woods | first6 = JH | date = Aug 1991 | title = Mirfentanil: pharmacological profile of a novel fentanyl derivative with opioid and nonopioid effects | url = | journal = Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 258 | issue = 2| pages = 502–10 | pmid = 1650830 }}</ref>

At high doses, it exhibits analgesic activity which is not fully reversed by [[opioid antagonists]], suggesting that the drug has both [[opioid]] and non-opioid mechanisms of action.<ref name="France 1991" /><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Carr | first1 = DJ | last2 = Brockunier | first2 = LL | last3 = Scott | first3 = M | last4 = Bagley | first4 = JR | last5 = France | first5 = CP | date = Aug 1996 | title = Mirfentanil antagonizes morphine-induced suppression of splenic NK activity in mice | url = | journal = Immunopharmacology | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 9–16 | pmid = 8880221 | doi=10.1016/0162-3109(95)00051-8}}</ref>

Side effects of [[fentanyl]] analogs are similar to those of fentanyl itself, which include [[itching]], [[nausea]] and potentially serious [[respiratory depression]], which can be life-threatening. Fentanyl analogs have killed hundreds of people throughout Europe and the former Soviet republics since the most recent resurgence in use began in Estonia in the early 2000s, and novel derivatives continue to appear.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.ijdp.org/article/S0955-3959%2815%2900097-3/abstract | title=Fentanyls: Are we missing the signs?

== Synthesis ==
Mirfentanil was synthesized via acylation of the product of the reaction of 2-chloropyrazine and 1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinone oxime with [[2-Furoyl chloride]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Jerome R.
