==Forms==
Faropenem was developed by [[Daiichi Asubio Pharma]], which markets it in two forms. 
* The sodium salt '''faropenem sodium''', available under the trade name '''Farom''', has been marketed in Japan since 1997. ({{PubChem|636379}})

<!-- out of date The company also stated their hope to have the product available for commercial sale months before the 2007 influenza season.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} -->

==Clinical use==
As of 8 September 2015, Faropenem has yet to receive marketing approval in the United States, and was submitted for consideration by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) on 20 December 2005. The new drug application dossier submitted included these proposed indications:
* acute bacterial sinusitis
* community-acquired pneumonia
* acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis
* uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections
* urinary tract infections

==History==
<!-- FDA rejects Replidyne’s faropenem 
Louisville firm drug rejected; considered “nonapprovable’ 
10/24/06 --> 
The FDA refused to approve faropenem, an antibiotic manufactured by Louisville-based Replidyne. The FDA said the drug was “nonapprovable”, but did not refer to specific safety concerns about the product.  The company will have to conduct new studies and clinical trials, lasting an estimated two more years, to prove the drug treats community-acquired pneumonia, bacterial sinusitis, chronic bronchitis, and skin infections.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In India it is available as FARONEM.
