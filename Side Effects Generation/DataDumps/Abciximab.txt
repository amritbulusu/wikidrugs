'''Abciximab''' (previously known as '''c7E3 Fab'''), a [[glycoprotein IIb/IIIa]] receptor antagonist manufactured by [[Janssen Biologics BV]] and distributed by [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] under the trade name '''ReoPro''', is a [[platelet aggregation inhibitor]] mainly used during and after [[coronary artery]] procedures like [[angioplasty]] to prevent [[platelet]]s from sticking together and causing thrombus ([[blood clot]]) formation within the coronary artery. It is a [[glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/cdi/abciximab.html|title=Abciximab|work=Drugs.com|accessdate=13 March 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100420014357/http://www.drugs.com/cdi/abciximab.html| archivedate= 20 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

While abciximab has a short plasma half-life, due to its strong affinity for its receptor on the [[platelet]]s, it may occupy some receptors for weeks. In practice, platelet aggregation gradually returns to normal about 96 to 120 hours after discontinuation of the drug. Abciximab is made from the [[Fragment antigen binding|Fab]] fragments of an [[immunoglobulin]] that targets the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on the platelet membrane.<ref name="INN">{{cite journal|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/inn/proposed_lists/prop_INN_list70.pdf|journal=WHO Drug Information|volume=7|issue=4|title=International Nonproprietary Names for Pharmaceutical Substances|year=1993}}</ref>

==Indications for use==
Abciximab is indicated for use in individuals undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (angioplasty with or without stent placement). The use of abciximab in this setting is associated with a decreased incidence of ischemic complications due to the procedure<ref>{{cite journal | title = Use of a monoclonal antibody directed against the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor in high-risk coronary angioplasty.

Research also shows that this drug can be of use for patients with diabetes and chronic renal insufficiency. It is not the appropriate drug of choice if a patient is scheduled for an emergency surgery (i.e., heart surgery) because bleeding time may take about 12 hours to normalize.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Abciximab has a plasma [[half-life]] of about ten minutes, with a second phase half-life of about 30 minutes. However, its effects on platelet function can be seen for up to 48 hours after the infusion has been terminated, and low levels of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor blockade are present for up to 15 days after the infusion is terminated. Abciximab does not require dose adjustments for patients with renal failure.<ref name="pmid27519521">Usta C, Turgut NT, Bedel A (2016) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=27519521 How abciximab might be clinically useful.] ''Int J Cardiol''  {{DOI|10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.07.213}} {{PMID|27519521}}</ref>

==Side-effects==
Many of the side effects of abciximab are due to its anti-platelet effects. This includes an increased risk of bleeding. The most common type of bleeding due to abciximab is gastrointestinal [[hemorrhage]].

[[Thrombocytopenia]] is a rare but known serious risk characterized by a severe drop in platelets circulating in the blood. Abciximab induced thrombocytopenia is usually rapid occurring hours after administration but may occur up to 16 days later.<ref>Profound delayed thrombocytopenia presenting 16 days after Abciximab (Reopro®) administration. Platelets. 2011;22(4):302-4. {{doi|10.3109/09537104.2010.518324}}.</ref> Transfusing platelets is the only known treatment for abciximab-induced thrombocytopenia, but this therapy may have limited effectiveness because the drug may bind and inhibit the receptors on the newly transfused platelets.
