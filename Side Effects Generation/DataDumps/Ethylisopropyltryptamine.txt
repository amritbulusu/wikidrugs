'''EiPT''' is a chemical in the [[tryptamine]] family, and produces [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] and [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic]] effects.  It was probably first synthesized by [[Alexander Shulgin]].

==Chemistry==

EiPT is short for '''''N''-[[ethyl group|ethyl]]-''N''-[[isopropyl]]-tryptamine'''.  The full chemical name of this structure is N-ethyl-N-[2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]propan-2-amine.  EiPT is a tryptamine, which all belong to a larger family of compounds known as [[indole|indol]]ethyl[[amine]]s.  EiPT is closely related to the compounds [[diethyltryptamine]] (DET) and [[DIPT]].

==Dosage==

In his book ''[[TiHKAL]]'', Alexander Shulgin lists a dosage for EiPT as being 24-40 [[milligram|mg]] taken [[Wiktionary:oral|orally]].

==Effects==

Very little is known about the [[psychopharmacological]] properties of EiPT, but reports suggest it produces psychedelic effects that can last 4-6 hours.  According to Shulgin, this compound tends to produce [[nausea]], [[dysphoria]], and other unpleasant side-effects.  It also lacks the hallucinatory and visual properties usually associated with psychedelic drugs.

==Dangers==

There have been no reported deaths or hospitalizations from EiPT, but its safety profile is unknown.

==Legality==

EiPT is unscheduled and uncontrolled in the United States, but possession and sales of EiPT could be prosecuted under the [[Federal Analog Act]] because of its structural similarities to DET.
