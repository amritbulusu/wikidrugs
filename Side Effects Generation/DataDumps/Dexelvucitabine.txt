'''Dexelvucitabine''' is a failed experimental agent for the management of [[HIV/AIDS|HIV infection]].  Dexelvucitabine is a [[cytidine]] nucleoside analog and nucleoside [[Reverse-transcriptase inhibitor|reverse transcriptase inhibitor]]. It was found to inhibit HIV-1 replication in vitro and during [[Phases of clinical research|Phase II clinical trials]], it was found to decrease mean viral load in patients with HIV.{{Medical citation needed|date=September 2015}}

On April 3, 2006, [[Pharmasset]] and [[Incyte]], the pharmaceutical companies developing dexelvucitabine announced the decision to cease further trials and development of the drug due to an increased incidence of grade 4 hyperlipasemia (an excess of the pancreatic enzyme, [[lipase]]) in a phase II trial.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}
