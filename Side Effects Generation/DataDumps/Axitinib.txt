==Clinical trials==
A Phase II [[clinical trial]] showed good response in combination chemotherapy with [[gemcitabine]] for advanced [[pancreatic cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Spano, JP |author2=Chodkiewicz, C |author3=Maurel, J |author4=Wong, R |author5=Wasan, H |author6=Barone, C |author7=Létourneau, R |author8=Bajetta, E |author9=Pithavala, Y |author10=Bycott, P |author11=Trask, P |author12=Liau, K |author13=Ricart, AD |author14=Kim, S |author15=Rixe, O |date=June 2008|title=Efficacy of gemcitabine plus axitinib compared with gemcitabine alone in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer: an open-label randomised phase II study|journal=Lancet|volume=371|issue=9630|pages=2101–2108|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60661-3|pmid=18514303}}</ref> However, Pfizer reported on January 30, 2009 that Phase III [[clinical trial]]s of the drug when used in combination with gemcitabine showed no evidence of improved survival rates over treatments using gemcitabine alone for advanced pancreatic cancer and halted the trial.<ref>{{cite web |url =https://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idINN3039502020090130?rpc=44 | title = Pfizer pancreatic cancer drug fails, trial halted|date = January 30, 2009 | publisher = Reuters}}</ref>

This is one of the first examples of a new indication for an existing drug being discovered by screening known drugs using a patient's own cells.

==Contraindications==

The only contraindication to axitinib is hypersensitivity to axitinib.<ref name = TGA/>

Cautions include:<ref name = MSR/>

* Hypertension
* Thromboembolic (both venous and arterial) events
* Haemorrhagic events (including cerebral haemorrhage)
* GI perforations and fistula
* Thyroid function, it is advised that thyroid function is measured initially and then periodically during treatment with axitinib.
* Stop treatment 24 hours prior to surgery due to potential clotting changes
* Proteinuria, it is advised that proteinuria is monitored initially and then periodically during therapy
* Elevated liver enzymes reported, it is advised that AST, ALT and bilirubin are regularly monitored during treatment with axitinib
* Moderate hepatic impairment requires dose reduction

==Adverse effects==
{{See also|List of adverse effects of axitinib}}
Diarrhea, hypertension, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, dysphonia, [[hand-foot syndrome]], weight decreased, vomiting, asthenia, and constipation are the most common side effects occurring in more than 20% of patients.<ref name=fda>{{cite web | title=FDA Prescribing Information | url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/202324lbl.pdf |date=30 Jan 2012}}</ref>

==Interactions==
Coadministration with strong [[CYP3A4]]/[[CYP3A5]] inhibitors should be avoided where possible as they may reduce plasma clearance of axitinib.<ref name = MSR/>

==Mechanism of action==
Its primary mechanism of action is thought to be [[VEGF receptor|Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor]] 1-3, [[v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog|c-KIT]] and [[platelet-derived growth factor receptor|PDGFR]] inhibition, this, in turn, enables it to inhibit [[angiogenesis]] (the formation of new blood vessels by tumours).<ref name = mech>{{cite journal|title=Axitinib for the Management of Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma|journal=Drugs in R&d|volume=11|issue=2|pages=113–126|doi=10.2165/11591240-000000000-00000|pmid=21679004|pmc=3585900|author1=Escudier, B |author2=Gore, M |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3585900/pdf/40268_2012_Article_11020113.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>
 
It was also proposed that it might act by inducing [[autophagy]], as some other tyrosine kinase inhibitors, like [[sorafenib]].<ref name=" pmid = 24213221">{{cite journal | author = Zhang Y | title = Screening of kinase inhibitors targeting BRAF for regulating autophagy based on kinase pathways. | journal = J Mol Med Rep | volume = 9 | issue = 1|date=Jan 2014 | pmid = 24213221 | url = http://www.spandidos-publications.com/mmr/9/1/83 | pages = 83–90 | doi=10.3892/mmr.2013.1781}}</ref>

It has also been shown<ref name="bcrabl" /> to bind (in a different conformation from the VEGF binding) to the [[Philadelphia chromosome|BCR-ABL]] fusion protein, specifically inhibiting the drug-resistant T315I mutant isoform.
