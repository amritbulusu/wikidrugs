==Medical uses==

===High blood pressure===
The approved uses for  are the long-term treatment of [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure) and [[angina pectoris]]. In hypertension, recent clinical guidelines generally favour [[diuretic]]s and [[ACE inhibitor]]s, although calcium channel antagonists, along with [[Thiazide|thiazide diuretics]], are still favoured as primary treatment for patients over 55 and [[African Americans|African American]] patients.<ref>''Hypertension: management of hypertension in adults in primary care''. Clinical guideline CG34. [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE), June 2006. [http://www.nice.org.uk/CG034 Fulltext index] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617040043/http://www.nice.org.uk/CG034 |date=2007-06-17 }}. {{ISBN|1-86016-285-1}}.</ref>

Sublingual nifedipine has previously been used in [[Hypertensive emergency|hypertensive emergencies]]. It was once frequently prescribed as needed to people taking [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAOIs]] for real or perceived hypertensive crises.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.dr-bob.org/tips/split/Nifed-MAOI-hypertension.html|title = Nifedipine for MAOI Hypertension? Reversing a Previous Recommendation|date = March 1997|accessdate = 22 Jan 2015|website = |publisher = Biological Therapies in Psychiatry|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150910023142/http://www.dr-bob.org/tips/split/Nifed-MAOI-hypertension.html|archivedate = 2015-09-10|df = }}</ref> This was found to be dangerous, and has been abandoned. Sublingual nifedipine causes blood-pressure lowering through peripheral vasodilation. It can cause an uncontrollable decrease in blood pressure, [[Tachycardia|reflex tachycardia]], and a steal phenomenon in certain vascular beds. There have been multiple reports in the medical literature of serious adverse effects with sublingual nifedipine, including [[Brain ischemia|cerebral ischemia/infarction]], [[myocardial infarction]], complete [[heart block]], and death. As a result of this, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] reviewed all data regarding the safety and efficacy of sublingual nifedipine for hypertensive emergencies in 1995, and concluded that the practice should be abandoned because it was neither safe nor efficacious.<ref name="pmid8861992">{{cite journal |vauthors=Grossman E, Messerli FH, Grodzicki T, Kowey P |title=Should a moratorium be placed on sublingual nifedipine capsules given for hypertensive emergencies and pseudoemergencies? |journal=JAMA |volume=276 |issue=16 |pages=1328–31 |year=1996 |pmid=8861992|doi=10.1001/jama.276.16.1328}}</ref><ref name="pmid12974970">{{cite journal |vauthors=Varon J, Marik PE |title=Clinical review: The management of hypertensive crises |journal=Critical care (London, England) |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=374–84 |year=2003 |pmid=12974970 |doi=10.1186/cc2351 |pmc=270718}}</ref> An exception to the avoidance of this practice is in the use of nifedipine in the treatment of hypertension associated with [[autonomic dysreflexia]] in [[spinal cord injury]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Campagnolo|first=DI|title=Autonomic Dysreflexia in Spinal Cord Injury|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/322809-medication|publisher=eMedicine|accessdate=2011-07-14}}</ref>

===Early labor===
Nifedipine has been used frequently as a [[tocolytic]] (agent that delays premature labor). A [[Cochrane review]] has concluded that it has benefits over placebo or no treatment for prolongation of pregnancy. It has also benefits over [[beta-agonists]] and may also have some benefits over [[atosiban]] and [[Magnesium sulfate|magnesium sulphate]], although [[atosiban]] results in fewer maternal adverse effects. No difference was found in the rate of deaths among babies around the time of birth, and data on longer-term outcomes were limited.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Flenady|first=Vicki|last2=Wojcieszek|first2=Aleena M.|last3=Papatsonis|first3=Dimitri N.

===Other===
[[Raynaud's phenomenon]] is often treated with nifedipine. A 2005 meta-analysis showed modest benefits (33% decrease in attack severity, 2.8-5 reduction in absolute number of attacks per week); it does conclude that most included studies used low doses of nifedipine.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Thompson AE, Pope JE |title=Calcium channel blockers for primary Raynaud's phenomenon: a meta-analysis |journal=Rheumatology (Oxford, England) |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=145–50 |year=2005 |pmid=15546967 |doi=10.1093/rheumatology/keh390}}</ref>

[[Topical]] nifedipine has been shown to be as effective as topical nitrates for [[anal fissure]]s.<ref name="pmid12794583">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ezri T, Susmallian S |title=Topical nifedipine vs. topical glyceryl trinitrate for treatment of chronic anal fissure |journal=Dis.

Nifedipine is also used in high-altitude medicine to treat [[high altitude pulmonary edema]].<ref name="eMedicine">{{cite web| url= http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic1956.htm| title= Pulmonary Edema, High-Altitude| author1= Ali, Mir Omar| author2= Qazi, Samia| lastauthoramp= yes| date= 2007-09-19| publisher= eMedicine| accessdate= 2007-11-25| deadurl= no| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071116141543/http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic1956.htm| archivedate= 2007-11-16| df= }}</ref>

Other uses include painful spasms of the [[esophagus]] such as from [[cancer]] or [[tetanus]]. It is also used for the small subset of people with [[pulmonary hypertension]].

==Side effects==
Nifedipine rapidly lowers blood pressure, and patients are commonly warned they may feel dizzy or faint after taking the first few doses. [[Tachycardia]] (fast heart rate) may occur as a reaction. These problems are much less frequent in the sustained-release preparations of nifedipine.

Extended release formulations of nifedipine should be taken on an empty stomach, and patients are warned not to consume anything containing [[grapefruit]] or grapefruit juice, as they raise blood nifedipine levels. There are several possible mechanisms, including the lowering of [[CYP3A4]] activity.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Odou P, Ferrari N, Barthélémy C, etal |title=Grapefruit juice-nifedipine interaction: possible involvement of several mechanisms |journal=Journal Clinical Pharm Ther |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=153–8 |year=2005 |pmid=15811168 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2710.2004.00618.x}}</ref>

==Overdose==
A number of persons have developed toxicity due to acute overdosage with nifedipine, either accidentally or intentionally, and via either oral or [[parenteral administration]]. The adverse effects include lethargy, bradycardia, marked hypotension and loss of [[consciousness]]. The drug may be quantitated in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Analytical methods usually involve gas or liquid [[chromatography]] and specimen concentrations are usually in the 100-1000 μg/L range.<ref>Nifediac package insert, TEVA Pharmaceuticals, Sellersville, Pennsylvania, August, 2009.</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Baselt, Randall C. |title=Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man |publisher=Biomedical Publications |location=Foster City, CA |year=2008 |pages=1108–1110|isbn=0-9626523-7-7}}</ref>

==Mechanism==
Nifedipine is a [[calcium channel blocker]]. Although nifedipine and other [[dihydropyridines]] are commonly regarded as specific to the [[L-type calcium channel]], they also possess nonspecific activity towards other [[voltage-dependent calcium channels]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Curtis|first1=Tim M.|last2=Scholfield|first2=C. Norman|title=Nifedipine blocks Ca2+ store refilling through a pathway not involving L-type Ca2+ channels in rabbit arteriolar smooth muscle store refilling through a pathway not involving L-type Ca2+ channels in rabbit arteriolar smooth muscle|journal=The Journal of Physiology|date=May 2001|volume=532|issue=3|pages=609–623|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7793.2001.0609e.x|pmc=2278590|pmid=11313433}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=McDonald|first1=TF|last2=Pelzer|first2=S|last3=Trautwein|first3=W|last4=Pelzer|first4=DJ|title=Regulation and modulation of calcium channels in cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle cells.|journal=Physiological reviews|date=April 1994|volume=74|issue=2|pages=365–507|pmid=8171118}}</ref>

Nifedipine has additionally been found to act as an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of the [[mineralocorticoid receptor]], or as an [[antimineralocorticoid]].<ref name="Luther2014">{{cite journal|last1=Luther|first1=James M.|title=Is there a new dawn for selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism?|journal=Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension|volume=23|issue=5|year=2014|pages=456–461|issn=1062-4821|doi=10.1097/MNH.0000000000000051}}</ref>

==History==
Nifedipine (initially BAY a1040) was developed by the [[Germany|German]] [[pharmaceutical company]] [[Bayer]], with most initial studies being performed in the early 1970s.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Vater W, Kroneberg G, Hoffmeister F, etal |title=[Pharmacology of 4-(2'-nitrophenyl)-2,6-dimethyl-1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester (Nifedipine, BAY a 1040)] |language=German |journal=Arzneimittel-Forschung |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=1–14 |year=1972 |pmid=4622472 |doi=}}</ref>

The use of nifedipine and related calcium channel antagonists was much reduced in response to 1995 trials that mortality was increased in patients with [[coronary artery disease]] who took nifedipine.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Furberg CD, Psaty BM, Meyer JV |title=Nifedipine.
