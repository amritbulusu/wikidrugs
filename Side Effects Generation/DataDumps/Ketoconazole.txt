'''Ketoconazole''' is a [[synthetic compound|synthetic]] [[imidazole]] [[antifungal drug|antifungal]] [[drug]] used primarily to treat [[fungal infection]]s. Ketoconazole is sold commercially as a tablet for oral administration (although this use has been discontinued in a number of countries), and in a variety of formulations for topical administration, such as creams (used to treat [[tinea]]; [[cutaneous candidiasis]], including candidal [[paronychia]]; and [[pityriasis versicolor]]) and shampoos (used primarily to treat [[dandruff]]—[[seborrhoeic dermatitis]] of the scalp).<ref name = AMH>{{cite book | title = Australian Medicines Handbook | year = 2013 | publisher = The Australian Medicines Handbook Unit Trust | isbn = 978-0-9805790-9-3 | edition = 2013 | place = Adelaide | editor = Rossi, S }}</ref>

The less toxic and generally more effective [[triazole]] antifungal agents [[fluconazole]] and [[itraconazole]] are usually preferred for systemic use. In 2013 the [[European Medicines Agency]]'s Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended that a ban be imposed on the use of oral ketoconazole for systemic use in humans throughout the European Union, after concluding that the risk of serious [[liver injury]] from systemic ketoconazole outweighs its benefits.<ref name="url_ema">{{cite web | url = http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/news_and_events/news/2013/07/news_detail_001855.jsp | title = European Medicines Agency recommends suspension of marketing authorisations for oral ketoconazole | date = 2013-07-26 | work = Press Release | publisher = European Medicines Agency }}</ref>  The oral formulation of ketoconazole was discontinued in Australia in 2013<ref>TGA. 10 October 2013 [https://www.tga.gov.au/alert/oral-ketoconazole-nizoral-200-mg-tablets Oral ketoconazole (Nizoral) 200 mg tablets: Product deregistration]</ref><ref>http://www.tga.gov.au/safety/alerts-medicine-oral-ketoconazole-131010.htm</ref> and in China in 2015.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sfda.gov.cn/WS01/CL0087/122883.html | title=国家食品药品监督管理总局关于停止生产销售使用酮康唑口服制剂的公告（2015年第85号） | publisher=[[China Food and Drug Administration]] | date=2015-06-25 | accessdate=2015-07-02 | language=zh}}</ref>

==Medical uses==

===Antifungal===

====Topical antifungal====
Topically administered ketoconazole is usually prescribed for fungal infections of the skin and mucous membranes, such as [[athlete's foot]], [[ringworm]], [[candidiasis]] (yeast infection or thrush), [[jock itch]], and [[tinea versicolor]].<ref name=phillips>{{cite book |vauthors=Phillips RM, Rosen T | title=Comprehensive Dermatologic Therapy | year=2013 | publisher=Saunders | location=Philadelphia | isbn=978-1-4377-2003-7 | pages=460–472 | edition=3rd | editor = Wolverton SE | chapter=Topical Antifungal Agents}}</ref> Topical ketoconazole is also used as a treatment for [[dandruff]] (seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp) and for [[seborrheic dermatitis]] on other areas of the body, perhaps acting in these conditions by suppressing levels of the fungus ''[[Malassezia furfur]]'' on the skin.<ref name=phillips/><ref name=neider>{{cite book |vauthors=Neider R, Fritsch PO | title=Dermatology | year=2012 | publisher=Saunders | location=Philadelphia | isbn=9780723435716 | pages=219–221 | edition=3rd | editor=Bolognia  JL | chapter=Other Eczematous Eruptions}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Young BK, Brodell RT, Cooper KD | title=Comprehensive Dermatologic Therapy | year=2013 | publisher=Saunders | location=Philadelphia | isbn=978-1-4377-2003-7 | pages=562–569 | edition=3rd | editor = Wolverton SE | chapter=Therapeutic Shampoos}}</ref>

====Systemic antifungal====
Ketoconazole has activity against many kinds of fungi that may cause human disease, such as ''[[Candida (fungus)|Candida]]'', ''[[Histoplasma]]'', ''[[Coccidioides]]'', and ''[[Blastomyces]]'' (although it is not active against ''[[Aspergillus]]'').<ref name=finkel>{{cite book |vauthors=Finkel R, Cubeddu LX, Clark MA | title=Pharmacology | year=2009 | publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | location=Baltimore | page=411 | edition=4th}}</ref> First synthesized in 1977,<ref name=phillips/> ketoconazole was the first orally-active [[azole]] antifungal medication.<ref name=finkel/> However, ketoconazole has largely been replaced as a first-line systemic antifungal medication by other azole antifungal agents, such as [[itraconazole]], because of ketoconazole's greater toxicity, poorer absorption, and more limited spectrum of activity.<ref name=finkel/><ref>{{cite book | author = Kauffman CA | title=Cecil Textbook of Medicine | year=2004 | publisher=Saunders | location=Philadelphia | isbn=0-7216-9652-X | page=2043 | edition=22nd | editor = Goldman L |editor2 = Ausiello, D | chapter=Introduction to the Mycoses}}</ref>

===Antiandrogen and antiglucocorticoid===
{{See also|CYP17A1 inhibitor}}
The side effects of ketoconazole are sometimes harnessed in the treatment of non-fungal conditions. While ketoconazole blocks the synthesis of the sterol [[ergosterol]] in fungi, in humans, at high dosages (>800&nbsp;mg/day), it potently inhibits the activity of several [[enzyme]]s necessary for the conversion of [[cholesterol]] to [[steroid hormone]]s such as [[testosterone]] and [[cortisol]].<ref name=finkel/><ref name="Becker2001" /> Specifically, ketoconazole has been shown to inhibit [[cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme]], which converts cholesterol to [[pregnenolone]], [[17α-hydroxylase]] and [[17,20-lyase]],<ref name="Becker2001" /> which convert [[pregnenolone]] into [[androgen]]s, and [[11β-hydoxylase]], which converts [[11-deoxycortisol]] to [[cortisol]].<ref name=Medscape-keto>{{cite web|title=MedScape|url=http://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/582330_3|website=Ectopic Cortisol Production Derived From Malignant Testicular Masses: Treatment and Management|publisher=Nature Publishing Group|accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref> All of these enzymes are mitochondrial [[cytochrome p450]] enzymes.<ref name="pmid6304148">{{cite journal | vauthors = Loose DS, Kan PB, Hirst MA, Marcus RA, Feldman D | title = Ketoconazole blocks adrenal steroidogenesis by inhibiting cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 71 | issue = 5 | pages = 1495–9 | date = May 1983 | pmid = 6304148 | pmc = 437014 | doi = 10.1172/JCI110903 }}</ref> Based on these [[antiandrogen]] and [[antiglucocorticoid]] effects, ketoconazole has been used with some success as a second-line treatment for certain forms of advanced [[prostate cancer]]<ref name="Becker2001" /><ref name=zelefsky>{{cite book |vauthors=Zelefsky MJ, Eastham JA, Sartor OA, Kantoff P | title=Cancer: Principles & Practice of Oncology | year=2008 | publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | location=Philadelphia | isbn=9780781772075 | page=1443 | edition=8th |veditors=DeVita VT, Lawrence TS, Rosenberg SA }}</ref> and for the suppression of [[glucocorticoid]] synthesis in the treatment of [[Cushing's syndrome]].<ref name=Cushing>{{cite journal | vauthors = Loli P, Berselli ME, Tagliaferri M | title = Use of ketoconazole in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 63 | issue = 6 | pages = 1365–71 | date = December 1986 | pmid = 3023421 | doi = 10.1210/jcem-63-6-1365 }}</ref> However, in the treatment of prostate cancer, concomitant glucocorticoid administration is needed to prevent [[adrenal insufficiency]].<ref name="Becker2001" /> Ketoconazole has additionally been used, in lower dosages, to treat [[hirsutism]] and, in combination with a [[GnRH analogue]], [[male-limited precocious puberty]].<ref name="Becker2001" /> In any case, the risk of [[hepatotoxicity]] with ketoconazole limits its use in all of these indications, especially in those that are benign such as hirsutism.<ref name="Becker2001" />

===Off-label uses===

====Hair loss====
[[File:Nizoral.jpg|thumb|Nizoral (ketoconazole) 2% shampoo]]
Ketoconazole shampoo in conjunction with an oral [[5α-reductase inhibitor]] has been used off label to treat [[androgenic alopecia]].

On July 2013, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) issued a warning that taking ketoconazole orally can cause severe liver injuries and adrenal gland problems.  It recommends Nizoral oral tablets should not be a first-line treatment for any fungal infection.  Nizoral should be used for the treatment of certain fungal infections, known as endemic mycoses, only when alternative antifungal therapies are not available or tolerated.<ref name="fda_warning">{{cite news | title=FDA limits usage of Nizoral (ketoconazole) oral tablets due to potentially fatal liver injury and risk of drug interactions and adrenal gland problems | newspaper=FDA Drug Safety Communication | url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm362415.htm | publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] | date=July 26, 2013 | accessdate=November 23, 2013}}</ref>

The topical formulations of Nizoral have not been associated with liver damage, adrenal problems, or drug interactions. These formulations include creams, shampoos, foams, and gels applied to the skin, unlike the Nizoral tablets, which are taken by mouth.<ref name="fda_warning"/>

==Pharmacology==
As an antifungal, ketoconazole is structurally similar to [[imidazole]], and interferes with the fungal synthesis of [[ergosterol]], a constituent of fungal [[cell membrane]]s, as well as certain [[enzyme]]s. As with all azole antifungal agents, ketoconazole works principally by inhibiting the [[enzyme]] [[cytochrome P450]] [[14α-demethylase]] (CYP51A1).<ref name="pmid6304148"/> This enzyme participates in the [[sterol]] [[biosynthesis]] pathway that leads from [[lanosterol]] to [[ergosterol]]. Lower doses of [[fluconazole]] and [[itraconazole]] are required to kill fungi compared to ketoconazole, as they have been found to have a greater [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for fungal cell membranes.

As an [[antiandrogen]], ketoconazole operates through at least two [[mechanism of action|mechanisms]] of action. First, and most notably, high oral doses of ketoconazole (e.g. 400&nbsp;mg three times per day) block both testicular and adrenal androgen biosynthesis, leading to a reduction in circulating testosterone levels.<ref name="Becker2001" /><ref name="pmid2652864">{{cite journal | vauthors = Witjes FJ, Debruyne FM, Fernandez del Moral P, Geboers AD | title = Ketoconazole high dose in management of hormonally pretreated patients with progressive metastatic prostate cancer.

Ketoconazole is a [[racemic mixture]] consisting of ''cis''-(2''S'',4''R'')-(−) and ''cis''-(2''R'',4''S'')-(+) enantiomers.<ref name = "Arakak" /> The ''cis''-(2''S'',4''R'') isomer was more potent in inhibiting [[CYP17A1|progesterone 17α,20-lyase]] than its enantiomer ([[IC50|IC<sub>50</sub>]] values of 0.05 and 2.38 ''μ''M, respectively) and in inhibiting [[Steroid 11-beta-hydroxylase|11β-hydroxylase]] (IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.152 and 0.608 ''μ''M, respectively). Both isomers were relatively weak inhibitors of human placental [[aromatase]].<ref name = "AR" />

===Resistance===
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2013}}
Resistance to ketoconazole has been observed in a number of clinical fungal isolates, including ''Candida albicans''. Experimentally, resistance usually arises as a result of mutations in the sterol biosynthesis pathway. Defects in the sterol 5-6 desaturase enzyme reduce the toxic effects of azole inhibition of the 14-alpha demethylation step. [[Multidrug resistance|Multidrug-resistance]] (MDR) genes can also play a role in reducing cellular levels of the drug. As azole antifungals all act at the same point in the sterol pathway, resistant isolates are normally cross-resistant to all members of the azole family.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cartledge JD, Midgley J, Gazzard BG | title = Clinically significant azole cross-resistance in Candida isolates from HIV-positive patients with oral candidosis | journal = Aids | volume = 11 | issue = 15 | pages = 1839–44 | date = December 1997 | pmid = 9412702 | doi = 10.1097/00002030-199715000-00008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sanglard D, Ischer F, Monod M, Bille J | title = Cloning of Candida albicans genes conferring resistance to azole antifungal agents: characterization of CDR2, a new multidrug ABC transporter gene | journal = Microbiology | volume = 143 ( Pt 2) | issue = Pt 2 | pages = 405–16 | date = February 1997 | pmid = 9043118 | doi = 10.1099/00221287-143-2-405 }}</ref>

==Pharmacokinetics==
