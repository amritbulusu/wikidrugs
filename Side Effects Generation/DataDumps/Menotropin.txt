'''Menotropin''' (also called '''human menopausal gonadotropin''' or '''hMG''') is a [[hormone|hormonally]] active medication for the treatment of [[fertility disturbances]]. Frequently the plural is used as the medication is a mixture of [[gonadotropin]]s. Menotropins are extracted from the urine of [[postmenopause|postmenopausal]] women.<ref name=Weijer2003>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/S1472-6483(10)62071-8| last1 = Van De Weijer | first1 = B.

==Description and usage==
Urine of postmenopausal women reflects the hypergonadotropic state of [[menopause]] -levels of [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) are high - and contain a mixture of these gonadotropins.<ref name=mesh>{{MeshName|Menotropins}}</ref><ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/menotropin TheFreeDictionary > Menotropin] Citing: Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers. 2007</ref><ref name=lunenfeld/> Other [[protein]] substances may be present, including small amounts of [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG).<ref name=Weijer2003/> In 1949 Piero Donini found a relatively simple method to extract gonadotropins from urine of postmenopausal women.<ref name=lunenfeld/><ref name=serono>{{cite web| url=http://www.lifesciencesfoundation.org/printer_events-item-818.html| author=Unknown| title=Serono goes recombinant| publisher=Serono Laboratories, 2011 |accessdate=2013-11-24}}</ref>  Menotropins were successfully introduced into clinical use by Bruno Lunenfeld in 1961.<ref name=lunenfeld>{{cite journal |url=http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/content/10/6/453.full|author=Lunenfeld B |title=Historical perspectives in gonadotropin therapy|journal=Human reproductive Update 2004, 10 (6):453-467 |doi=10.1093/humupd/dmh044|accessdate=2013-11-25}}</ref> While earlier menotropin medications contained FSH and LH at a 1:1 ratio, the recognition that it is FSH that is critical for follicle stimulation has led to development of newer preparations that contain a much higher FSH/LH ratio, Fertinex being an example.<ref name=lunenfeld/>

Menotropin preparations are designed for use in selected women where they stimulate the ovaries to mature follicles, thus making them more fertile. They are administered by typically daily injection, intramuscularly or subcutaneously, for about ten days under close supervision to adjust dose and duration of therapy. They can also be used in [[hypogonadism|hypogonadal]] men to stimulate sperm production.

Human urinary-derived menotropin preparations are exposed to the theoretical risk of infection from menopausal donors of urine. Nevertheless, the failure to irrefutably demonstrate infectivity following intracerebral inoculation with urine from [[transmissible spongiform encephalopathy]](TSE)-infected hosts suggests that the risk associated with products derived from urine is merely theoretical.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Reichl H, Balen A, Jansen CA |title=Prion transmission in blood and urine: what are the implications for recombinant and urinary-derived gonadotrophins? |journal=Hum.

[[Recombinant DNA|Recombinant]] gonadotropins have to a large degree replaced hMG in fertility treatments. The recombinant process allows for the production of pure FSH or LH not "contaminated" by other proteins that may be present after urinary extraction. While some head-on studies seem not to suggest that "pure FSH" gives better results than hMG.,<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Bagratee | first1 = J.
