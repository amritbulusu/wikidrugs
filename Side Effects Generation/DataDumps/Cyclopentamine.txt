'''Cyclopentamine''' (trade names '''Clopane''', '''Cyclonarol''', '''Cyclosal''', '''Cyklosan''', '''Nazett''', '''Sinos''', among others) is a [[sympathomimetic]] [[Amine#Aliphatic amines|alkylamine]], classified as a [[vasoconstrictor]]. Cyclopentamine was [[indication (medicine)|indicated]] in the past as an [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] (OTC) [[medication]] for use as a [[human nose|nasal]] [[decongestant]], notably in [[Europe]] and [[Australia]], but has now been largely [[discontinuation|discontinued]] possibly due to the availability, effectiveness, and safety of a structurally similar drug, [[propylhexedrine]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

== Pharmacology ==
Cyclopentamine acts as a [[releasing agent]] of the [[catecholamine]] [[neurotransmitter]]s [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline), [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline), and [[dopamine]].<ref name="pmid14209515">{{cite journal | author = Schmidt JL, Fleming WW | title = A Nonsympathomimetic Effect of Cyclopentamine and Beta-Mercaptoethylamine in the Rabbit Ileum. | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 145 | issue = | pages = 83–6 |date=July 1964 | pmid = 14209515 | doi =  }}</ref> Its effects on norepinephrine and epinephrine mediate its decongestant effects, while its effects on all three neurotransmitters are responsible for its stimulant properties. When ingested [[oral administration|oral]]ly in sufficient [[dose (biochemistry)|quantities]], cyclopentamine produces similar effects to [[amphetamine]], methamphetamine, and propylhexedrine.<ref name="pmid4390216">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/jps.2600580722 | author = Ghouri MS, Haley TJ | title = In vitro evaluation of a series of sympathomimetic amines and the beta-adrenergic blocking properties of cyclopentamine | journal = Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences | volume = 58 | issue = 7 | pages = 882–4 |date=July 1969 | pmid = 4390216 }}</ref><ref name="pmid5116035">{{cite journal | author = Marley E, Stephenson JD | title = Actions of dexamphetamine and amphetamine-like amines in chickens with brain transections. | journal = [[British Journal of Pharmacology]] | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 522–42 |date=August 1971 | pmid = 5116035 | pmc = 1665761 | doi = 10.1111/j.1476-5381.1971.tb07138.x}}</ref>

== Chemistry ==
Cyclopentamine is the cyclopentane [[Homology (chemistry)|homolog]] of [[propylhexedrine]], differing only in terms of the contracted ring size of a cyclopentane, containing one —CH<sub>2</sub>— unit less than the [[cyclohexyl]] group.

In terms of the [[Open chain compound|acyclic]] part of the molecule, both cyclopentamine and propylhexedrine are the same as [[methamphetamine]], all three molecules containing the 2-methylaminopropyl side-chain. The difference between them is that whereas methamphetamine is an aromatic molecule containing a [[phenyl group]], cyclopentamine and propylhexedrine are entirely aliphatic and contain no delocalized electrons at all. The effect that this has on potency is that the reduced [[alicyclic]]-alkylamines are weaker than unsaturated (meth)amphetamine.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}
