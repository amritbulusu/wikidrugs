'''''Lactuca virosa''''' is a plant in the ''[[Lactuca]]'' (lettuce) genus, ingested often for its mild [[analgesic]] and [[sedative]] effects which are similar to those of [[ibuprofen]].<ref name=Wesolowska>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jep.2006.03.003 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874106001280 | title = Analgesic and sedative activities of lactucin and some lactucin-like guaianolides in mice | year = 2006 | last1 = Wesołowska | first1 = A. | last2 = Nikiforuk | first2 = A. | last3 = Michalska | first3 = K. | last4 = Kisiel | first4 = W. | last5 = Chojnacka-Wójcik | first5 = E. | journal = Journal of Ethnopharmacology | volume = 107 | issue = 2 | pages = 254–8 | pmid = 16621374}}</ref> It is related to common lettuce (''[[Lactuca sativa|L. sativa]]''), and is often called '''wild lettuce''', '''bitter lettuce''', '''laitue vireuse''', '''opium lettuce''', '''poisonous lettuce''', '''tall lettuce''', '''great lettuce'''<ref name=BSBI07>{{cite web|title=BSBI List 2007 |publisher=Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland |url=http://www.bsbi.org.uk/BSBIList2007.xls |format=xls |accessdate=2014-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6VqJ46atN?url=http://www.bsbi.org.uk/BSBIList2007.xls |archivedate=2015-01-25 |df= }}</ref> or '''rakutu-karyumu-so'''.

''Lactuca virosa'' is widespread across much of central and southern Europe.<ref>[http://luirig.altervista.org/flora/taxa/index1.php?scientific-name=lactuca+virosa Altervista Flora Italiana, ''Lactuca virosa'' L.] includes photos and European distribution map</ref> It can be found locally in the south east and east of [[England]]. In the rest of Great Britain it is very rare, and in Ireland it is absent. It is also found in the [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] Region of [[Pakistan]] [[India]] and [[Australia]] where it grows in the wild.

In North America, it has been documented as introduced in [[California]], [[Alabama]], [[Iowa]], and [[Washington, DC]], and grows wild in other parts of the continent.<ref>[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=250067036 Flora of North America, ''Lactuca virosa'' Linnaeus, 1753. ]</ref>

==Description==

''Lactuca virosa'' is [[Biennial plant|biennial]], similar to prickly lettuce ''[[Lactuca serriola]]'' but taller - it can grow to 200&nbsp;cm (80 inches or almost 7 feet).  It is also stouter, the stem and leaves are more purple flushed,{{Disputed-inline|date=August 2011}} the leaves are less divided, but more spreading.<ref name="The Wild Flower Key"/>Similar to ''Mycelis muralis'' but showing more than 5 florets.<ref>Parnell, J and Curtis, T. 2012. ''Webb's An Irish Flora'' Cork University Press {{ISBN|978-185918-4783}}</ref>

The achene is purple black, without bristles at the tip. The [[Pappus (flower structure)|pappus]] is the same as ''Lactuca serriola''.<ref name="The Wild Flower Key"/>

In the northern hemisphere, it flowers from July until September.<ref name="The Wild Flower Key">{{cite book |last=Rose |first=Francis|authorlink=Francis Rose  |title=The Wild Flower Key |year=1981 |publisher=Frederick Warne & Co|isbn=0-7232-2419-6 |pages=391–392}}</ref>

==History==
''Lactuca virosa'' was used in the 19th century by physicians when opium could not be obtained. It was studied extensively by the Council of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain in 1911. They discovered two chemicals responsible for the properties of ''L. virosa''; [[lactucopicrin]] and [[lactucin]].  In the United States, the plant experienced a resurgence in popularity in the 1970s. Today the plant is [[Controlled Substances Act|un-scheduled]] by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), meaning it is legal to grow, purchase, and own without prescription or license.

==Pharmacology==
{{refimprove-section|date=September 2011}}
A latex which is called [[lactucarium]] can be derived from the extract of the stem secretions of ''Lactuca virosa''.  Oils and extracts can also be produced from ''L. virosa''. These oils and extracts have sedative properties in rodents.<ref name=Wesolowska/> 

''Lactuca virosa'' contains [[flavonoid]]s, [[coumarin]]s, and [[N-Methylphenethylamine|''N''-methyl-β-phenethylamine]].<ref>[http://www.holistic-online.com/Herbal-Med/_Herbs/h307.htm Holistic Online herb information: Wild Lettuce]</ref>{{rs|date=September 2011}}  A variety of other chemical compounds have been isolated from ''L. virosa''.  One of the compounds, [[lactucin]], is an [[adenosine receptor]] agonist ''[[in vitro]]'',<ref name=Wesolowska/> while another, [[lactucopicrin]], has been shown to act as an [[acetylcholinesterase inhibitor]] ''in vitro''.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 16472227 | year = 2005 | last1 = Rollinger | first1 = JM | last2 = Mocka | first2 = P | last3 = Zidorn | first3 = C | last4 = Ellmerer | first4 = EP | last5 = Langer | first5 = T | last6 = Stuppner | first6 = H | title = Application of the in combo screening approach for the discovery of non-alkaloid acetylcholinesterase inhibitors from ''Cichorium intybus'' | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 185–93 | journal = Current drug discovery technologies | doi = 10.2174/1570163054866855}}</ref>
