'''BOB''', or '''4-[[bromine|bromo]]-2,5,beta-tri[[methoxy]][[phenethylamine]]''', is a lesser-known [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|psychedelic drug]].  It is the beta-methoxy [[analog (chemistry)|analog]] of [[2C-B]]. BOB was first synthesized by [[Alexander Shulgin]]. In his book ''[[PiHKAL|PiHKAL (Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved)]]'', the dosage range is listed as 10–20&nbsp;mg, and the duration listed as 10–20 hours. BOB produces an altered state of consciousness, [[tinnitus]], a pleasant [[Paresthesia|tingling]] throughout the body, and a sense of awareness.<ref>{{CitePiHKAL}}</ref> Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of BOB.
