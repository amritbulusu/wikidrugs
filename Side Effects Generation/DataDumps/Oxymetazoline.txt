'''Oxymetazoline''' is a selective [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub> adrenergic receptor]] [[agonist]] and [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptor]] [[partial agonist]]. It is a [[topical decongestant]], used in the form of oxymetazoline [[hydrochloride]]. It was developed from [[xylometazoline]] at [[Merck KGaA|E. Merck Darmstadt]] by Fruhstorfer in 1961.<ref>German Patent 1,117,588</ref> Oxymetazoline is generally available as a [[nasal spray]].

== Medical uses ==
Oxymetazoline is available over-the-counter as a [[topical decongestant]] in the form of oxymetazoline [[hydrochloride]] in [[nasal spray]]s such as Otrivin, [[Afrin (nasal spray)|Afrin]], Operil, Dristan, Dimetapp, Oxyspray, Facimin, Nasivin, Nostrilla, Sudafed OM, [[Vicks Sinex]], Zicam, SinuFrin, and Mucinex Full Force.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merck.com/mmpe/lexicomp/oxymetazoline.html |title=Oxymetazoline: Drug Information Provided by Lexi-Comp: Merck Manual Professional |publisher=Merck.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-15}}</ref>

Due to its vasoconstricting properties, oxymetazoline is also used to treat [[epistaxis|nose bleeds]]<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0952-8180(90)90043-3 |pmid=2310576 |title=A comparison of cocaine, lidocaine with epinephrine, and oxymetazoline for prevention of epistaxis on nasotracheal intubation |journal=Journal of Clinical Anesthesia |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=16–20 |year=1990 |last1=Katz |first1=Robert I. |last2=Hovagim |first2=Alec R. |last3=Finkelstein |first3=Harvey S. |last4=Grinberg |first4=Yair |last5=Boccio |first5=Remigio V. |last6=Poppers |first6=Paul J. }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmid=7661519 |year=1995 |author1=Krempl |first1=G.

== Side effects and special considerations ==

=== Rebound congestion ===
It is recommended that oxymetazoline not be used for more than three days, as [[Rebound effect|rebound]] congestion, or [[rhinitis medicamentosa]], may occur.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16784007 |year=2006 |author1=Ramey |first1=J. T. |title=Rhinitis medicamentosa |journal=Journal of investigational allergology & clinical immunology |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=148–55 |last2=Bailen |first2=E |last3=Lockey |first3=R. F. |url=http://www.jiaci.org/summary/vol16-issue3-num52 }}</ref> Patients who continue to use oxymetazoline beyond this point may become dependent on the medication to relieve their chronic congestion.

=== Effects of benzalkonium chloride ===
Some studies have found that [[benzalkonium chloride]], a common additive to oxymetazoline nasal sprays, may damage nasal [[Epithelium|epithelia]] and exacerbate rhinitis medicamentosa. However, the majority of studies find benzalkonium chloride to be a safe preservative.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.otohns.2003.07.005 |pmid=14726922 |title=Safety review of benzalkonium chloride used as a preservative in intranasal solutions: An overview of conflicting data and opinions |journal=Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery |volume=130 |issue=1 |pages=131–41 |year=2004 |last1=Marple |first1=B |last2=Roland |first2=P |last3=Benninger |first3=M }}</ref>

=== Use in pregnancy ===
The [[Food and Drug Administration]] places oxymetazoline in [[pregnancy category|category C]], indicating risk to the fetus cannot be ruled out.  While it has been shown that a single dose does not significantly alter either maternal or fetal circulation,<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=2196495 |year=1990 |author1=Rayburn |first1=W. F. |title=Uterine and fetal Doppler flow changes from a single dose of a long-acting intranasal decongestant |journal=Obstetrics and gynecology |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=180–2 |last2=Anderson |first2=J. C. |last3=Smith |first3=C. V. |last4=Appel |first4=L. L. |last5=Davis |first5=S. A. |url=http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Abstract/1990/08000/Uterine_and_Fetal_Doppler_Flow_Changes_From_a.6.aspx }}</ref> this subject has not been studied extensively enough to draw reliable conclusions.

== Overdose ==
If accidentally ingested, standard methods to remove unabsorbed drugs should be considered.{{clarify|date=December 2016}} There is no specific antidote for oxymetazoline, although its pharmacological effects may be reversed by α adrenergic antagonists such as [[phentolamine]]. In the event of a possibly life-threatening overdose (such as a [[hypertensive crisis]]), [[benzodiazepines]] should be considered to decrease the likelihood of [[seizures]] and [[convulsions]], as well as reduce anxiety and to lower blood pressure. In children, oxymetazoline may produce profound central nervous system depression due to stimulation of central α<sub>2</sub> receptors and [[imidazoline receptor]]s, much like [[clonidine]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== Pharmacology ==
=== Mechanism of action ===
Oxymetazoline is a [[sympathomimetic]] that selectively agonizes [[Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>]] and, partially, [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>2</sub>]] [[adrenergic receptor]]s.<ref name="adrenomimetic">Westfall Thomas C, Westfall David P, "Chapter 6. Neurotransmission: The Autonomic and Somatic Motor Nervous Systems" (Chapter). Brunton LL, Lazo JS, Parker KL: Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 11e: http://www.accessmedicine.com/content.aspx?aID=954433.</ref> Since vascular beds widely express α<sub>1</sub> receptors, the action of oxymetazoline results in [[vasoconstriction]]. In addition, the local application of the drug also results in vasoconstriction due to its action on endothelial postsynaptic α<sub>2</sub> receptors; systemic application of α<sub>2</sub> agonists, in contrast, causes [[vasodilation]] because of centrally-mediated inhibition of sympathetic tone via presynaptic α<sub>2</sub> receptors.<ref name="alpha">Biaggioni Italo, Robertson David, "Chapter 9. Adrenoceptor Agonists & Sympathomimetic Drugs" (Chapter). Katzung BG: Basic & Clinical Pharmacology, 11e: http://www.accessmedicine.com/content.aspx?aID=4520412.</ref> Vasoconstriction of vessels results in relief of nasal congestion in two ways: first, it increases the diameter of the airway lumen; second, it reduces fluid exudation from postcapillary venules.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1398-9995.1997.tb04877.x |pmid=9353554 |title=Microvascular anatomy of the nose |journal=Allergy |volume=52 |issue=40 Suppl |pages=7–11 |year=1997 |last1=Widdicombe |first1=John }}</ref> It can reduce nasal airway resistance (NAR) up to 35.7% and nasal mucosal blood flow up to 50%.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0022215100099151 |pmid=3950497 |title=Vascular effects of topical oxymetazoline on human nasal mucosa |journal=The Journal of Laryngology & Otology |volume=100 |issue=3 |pages=285–8 |year=2007 |last1=Bende |first1=M. |last2=Löth |first2=S. }}</ref>

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Imidazolines are sympathomimetic agents, with primary effects on α adrenergic receptors and little if any effect on [[Adrenergic receptor#.CE.B2 receptors|β adrenergic receptors]]. Oxymetazoline is readily absorbed orally. Effects on α receptors from systemically absorbed oxymetazoline hydrochloride may persist for up to 7 hours after a single dose. The elimination half-life in humans is 5–8 hours. It is excreted unchanged both by the kidneys (30%) and in feces (10%).

== History ==
The oxymetazoline brand Afrin was first sold as a prescription medication in 1966. After finding substantial early success as a prescription medication, it became available as an over-the-counter drug in 1975. [[Schering-Plough]] did not engage in heavy advertising until 1986.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Dougherty|first=Phillip H.|title=Advertising; Afrin Goes After Users Of Nasal Decongestants|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=20 October 1986|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/20/business/advertising-afrin-goes-after-users-of-nasal-decongestants.html|accessdate=2015-03-30}}</ref> From the late 1980s to mid 1990s, Afrin featured in many notable [[television advertisement]]s. Some of these commercials showed men, women, and children using other brands of nasal sprays, and then standing upside down or hanging upside down from playground equipment to prevent their nasal spray from dripping out. This was juxtaposed with Afrin users having no problems.

== Society and culture ==
=== Brand names ===
Brand names include Afrin, Drixine, [[Dristan]], Nasivin, Nasivion, Nezeril, Nostrilla, Logicin, [[Vicks Sinex]], [[Visine]] L.R., Sudafed OM, [[Zicam]], Otrivin Oxy, SinuFrin and Mucinex Sinus-Max.
