==History==
Baxter International was founded in 1931 by Donald Baxter, a [[Los Angeles]]-based [[Physician|medical doctor]], as a manufacturer and distributor of [[intravenous therapy]] solutions.<ref name = "history"/> Seeing a need for products closer to the Midwest, the company opened a manufacturing plant in [[Glenview, Illinois]], in 1933.<ref name = "history"/> Baxter's interest was bought out in 1935 by Ralph Falk, who established a [[research and development]] function.  In 1939 the company developed a vacuum-type collection container, extending the [[shelf life]] of blood from hours to weeks.  In 1954, the company expanded operations outside of the United States by opening an office in [[Belgium]]. In 1956 Baxter International introduced the first functioning [[artificial kidney]], and in 1971 became a member of the [[Fortune 500]].

In 1971, Baxter built a major manufacturing plant in [[Ashdod, Israel]], and as a result, the company was placed on the [[Arab League boycott of Israel|Arab League boycott list]] in the early 1980s.<ref name=boycott>{{cite book|last=Feiler|first=Gil|title=From Boycott to Economic Cooperation: The Political Economy of the Arab Boycott of Israel|publisher=Frank Cass Publishers|year=2005|pages=70}}</ref>

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the company expanded to deliver a wider variety of products and services (including vaccines, a greater variety of blood products) through acquisitions of various companies.  Sales and production facilities also expanded throughout the world.<ref name = history>{{cite web | url=http://www.baxter.com/about_baxter/company_profile/sub/history.html | title=History | publisher=Baxter International | access-date=July 8, 2009 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602055413/http://www.baxter.com/about_baxter/company_profile/sub/history.html | archivedate=June 2, 2009 }}</ref>

Investigation into the contamination has focused on raw heparin produced by Changzhou Scientific Protein Laboratories, a China-based branch of [[Scientific Protein Laboratories]], based in [[Waunakee, Wisconsin]]. Due to procedural errors, Changzhou SPL's facilities were never subjected to inspection by US FDA officials, as required by FDA regulations. In addition, Changzhou SPL's products were also never certified as safe for use in pharmaceutical products by Chinese FDA officials, due to Changzhou SPL's registration as a chemical company rather than a pharmaceutical manufacturer.<ref name=wp1>"Contaminant Found in Blood Thinner", ''Washington Post'' (Online edition), March 5, 2008</ref><ref name=reuters1>"Baxter probe focuses on US-owned China plant – WSJ", Reuters, February 15, 2008</ref><ref name=wsj1>"China Washes Hands on Heparin Purity", ''Wall Street Journal'' (Online edition) February 27, 2008</ref> Though Baxter was first to recall heparin because of increased adverse reactions, after the contaminant was identified and testing protocols were shared with other manufacturers globally, over a dozen other companies in nearly a dozen countries issued recalls, which linked back to certain supply points in China.

===2010 hepatitis C infections===
In 2010, a jury in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], ordered Baxter and Teva Pharmaceuticals to pay $144 million to patients who had been infected with [[hepatitis C]] after doctors wrongly reused dirty medical supplies to administer [[propofol]] to patients, although the label for propofol clearly states that it is for single-patient use only and that aseptic procedures should be used at all times.<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-05-08/teva-baxter-will-fight-500-million-in-damages-over-propofol.html "Teva, Baxter Will Fight $500 Million in Damages Over Propofol", ''Business Week'', May 8, 2010]</ref> Per a 2009 indemnity agreement between Teva (the manufacturer) and Baxter (acting as a distributor on behalf of Teva), the litigation and related settlements were defended and paid by Teva.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://investor.baxter.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=86121&p=irol-reportsannual;|title=2011 annual report, page 87|author=|date=|website=Baxter.com|access-date=July 16, 2017}}</ref>

In December 2011, the non-partisan organization [[Public Campaign#Reports|Public Campaign]] criticized Baxter for spending $10.45 million on [[lobbying]] and not paying any taxes during 2008–2010, instead getting $66 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $926 million.<ref>{{cite web |last=Portero |first=Ashley |title=30 Major U.S. Corporations Paid More to Lobby Congress Than Income Taxes, 2008–2010 |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/264481/20111209/30-major-u-s-corporations-paid-lobby.htm |publisher=[[International Business Times]] |access-date=December 26, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64D9GyQG0?url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/264481/20111209/30-major-u-s-corporations-paid-lobby.htm |archivedate=December 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref>
