'''Prenylamine''' ('''Segontin''') is a [[calcium channel blocker]] of the [[substituted amphetamine|amphetamine]] [[chemical class]] which was used as a [[vasodilator]] in the treatment of [[angina pectoris]]; it was introduced in the 1960s by German manufacturer [[:de:Chemische Werke Albert|Albert-Roussel pharma gmbh]]<ref name=Rashmi>{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Rashmi R.|editor1-last=Mann|editor1-first=Ronald D.|editor2-last=Andrews|editor2-first=Elizabeth B.|title=Pharmacovigilance|date=2007|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=Chichester, England|isbn=9780470059227|page=116|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2yoID1Cv99oC&pg=PA116|chapter=Withdrawal of Terodiline: A Tale of Two Toxicities}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZLnCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA40|title=Calcium Entry Blockers in Cardiovascular and Cerebral Dysfunctions|last=Godfraind|first=Theophile|last2=Herman|first2=Arnold G.|last3=Wellens|first3=Donald|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|year=2012|isbn=9400960336|location=|page=40|quote=|via=google books}}</ref> which was acquired by [[Hoechst AG]] in 1974 and which in turn became part of [[Sanofi Aventis]] in 2005.

It was withdrawn from market worldwide in 1988 because it caused [[Prolonged QT interval|QT prolongation]] and [[Torsades de pointes]] which in turn caused [[Sudden cardiac arrest|sudden death]].<ref name=Rashmi/><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fung|first=Man|last2=Thornton|first2=Anna|last3=Mybeck|first3=Kathy|last4=Wu|first4=Jasmanda Hsiao-hui|last5=Hornbuckle|first5=Ken|last6=Muniz|first6=Edmundo|date=2001-01-01|title=Evaluation of the Characteristics of Safety Withdrawal of Prescription Drugs from Worldwide Pharmaceutical Markets-1960 to 1999*|url=http://dij.sagepub.com/content/35/1/293|journal=Drug Information Journal|language=en|volume=35|issue=1|pages=293–317|doi=10.1177/009286150103500134|issn=2168-4790}}</ref>

The cardiac side effects were not detected during clinical development, but only emerged after the drug was widely used.<ref name=Rashmi/>

Prenylamine has two primary molecular target in human, [[Calmodulin]] and [[Myosin light-chain kinase|Myosin light-chain kinase 2]] found in skeletal and cardiac muscle.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2016-08-17|editor-last=DrugBank|title=Prenylamine|url=https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB04825|journal=DrugBank}}</ref> Pharmacologically, it decreases the sympathetic stimulation on cardiac muscle predominantly through partial depletion of [[catecholamine]] via competitive inhibition of reuptake by storage granule, which lead to further depletion due to spontaneous leakage as a result of disturbance of equilibrium.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=J.
