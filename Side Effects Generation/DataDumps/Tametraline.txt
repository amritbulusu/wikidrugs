'''Tametraline''' ('''CP-24,441''') is the parent of a series of chemical compounds investigated at [[Pfizer]] that eventually led to the development of [[sertraline]] ('''CP-51,974-1''').<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Koe | first1 = BK | last2 = Weissman | first2 = A | last3 = Welch | first3 = WM | last4 = Browne | first4 = RG | title = Sertraline, 1''S'',4''S''-''N''-Methyl-4-(3,4-Dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-Tetrahydro-1-Naphthylamine, a New Uptake Inhibitor with Selectivity for Serotonin | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | date = September 1983 | volume = 226 | issue = 3 | pages = 686–700 | pmid = 6310078 | url = http://biochem.uvm.edu/courses/files/381_fall_2006_sertraline.pdf | accessdate = 10 August 2016}}</ref>

Sertraline has been called "3,4-dichloro-tametraline". This is correct but it is an oversimplification in the sense that sertraline is the ''S'',''S''-isomer whereas tametraline is the 1''R'',4''S''-stereoisomer.

[[Indatraline]] is an indanamine homolog of tetralin-based tametraline, although in the case of indatraline the product is pm-dichlorinated.

"As expected, [[Friedel-Crafts]] [[cyclization]] of the diarylbutyric acid derivatives # to the most reactive ring was observed with little or none of the alternative isomer being detected."

==Structure-activity relationship==
Certain aromatic substitutients have a potentiating effect (e.g., ''p''-Br), whereas others negate the compound's intrinsic activity.

It is not right to think of the dimethyl analogs as a "[[prodrug]]" to the monomethylated drugs (cf. [[indatraline]], "31,345"), but it is correct that it is a "[[wikt:latentiated|latentiated]]" form of the drug. This word is from the [[salsalate]] page. This was the reason why [[sertraline]] was made only as monomethylated because apparently according to the orders the 1° amine is inactive therefore the drug would have a shorter duration of activity.

Interestingly, (±)-sertraline is not entirely [[Serotonin transporter|SERT]] selective until it has been resolved into the ''S'',''S''-enantiomer.

In terms of the ''trans-'' isomers there is relatively marked separation in the activity between the ''R'',''S''- and ''S'',''R''-enantiomers. This stands in contrast to what has been observed in the homologous indamine class where both of the ''trans-'' enantiomers possessed significant [[Triple reuptake inhibitor|TRI]] activity at all three of the monoamine transporters.

<small>During his 40 years at Pfizer, Koe authored more than 100 articles and papers.
...
Koe learned to review previous studies and to build on findings that had failed to lead to successful products. In his early work with serotonin, for example, he studied the chemical tametraline, which proved ineffective as an anti-depressant.

Tests showed the chemical functioned more as a stimulant, a use Pfizer was not interested in pursuing. Although his research had failed to yield the desired result, Koe was convinced that the development of a viable anti-depressant was within reach.</small>
