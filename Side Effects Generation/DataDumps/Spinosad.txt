'''Spinosad''' is an [[insecticide]] based on chemical compounds found in the bacterial species ''[[Saccharopolyspora spinosa]]''. The genus ''[[Saccharopolyspora]]'' was discovered in 1985 in isolates from crushed [[sugarcane]] which produce yellowish-pink aerial [[hyphae]], with bead-like chains of spores enclosed in a characteristic hairy sheath.<ref name=one>{{cite journal|last=Mertz|first=Frederick|author2=Raymond C. Yao |title=Saccharopolyspora spinosa sp. nov. Isolated from soil Collected in a Sugar Mill Rum Still|journal=International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology |date=Jan 1990 |volume=40|issue=1|pages=34–39|doi=10.1099/00207713-40-1-34}}</ref>  This genus is defined as aerobic, Gram-positive, nonacid-fast [[Actinobacteria|actinomycetes]] with fragmenting substrate mycelium. ''S. spinosa'' was isolated from soil collected inside a nonoperational sugar mill rum still in the Virgin Islands. Spinosad is a mixture of chemical compounds in the spinosyn family that has a generalized structure consisting of a unique tetracyclic ring system attached to an [[amino sugar]] (<small>D</small>-forosamine) and a neutral sugar (tri-''Ο''-methyl-<small>L</small>-rhamnose).<ref name=four>{{cite journal|last=Qiao|first=Meihua|author2=Daniel E.

Spinosad is a novel mode-of-action insecticide derived from a family of natural products obtained by fermentation of ''S. spinosa''. Spinosyns occur in over 20 natural forms, and over 200 synthetic forms (spinosoids) have been produced in the lab.<ref name=five>{{cite journal|last=Watson|first=Gerald|title=Actions of Insecticidal Spinosyns on gama-Aminobutyric Acid Responses for Small-Diameter Cockroach Neurons|journal=Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology|date=31 May 2001|volume=71|pages=20–28|doi=10.1006/pest.2001.2559}}</ref>  Spinosad contains a mix of two spinosoids, spinosyn A, the major component, and spinosyn D (the minor component), in a roughly 17:3 ratio.<ref name=one />

==Mode of action==
Spinosad is highly active, by both contact and ingestion, in numerous insect species.<ref name=three>{{cite journal|last=Hertlein|first=Mark|author2=Gary D. Thompson |author3=Bhadriraju Subramanyam |author4=Christos G. Athanassiou |title=Spinosad: A new natural product for stored grain protection|journal=stored products|date=12 January 2011|volume=47|pages=131–146|url=http://www.elsevier.com/locate/spr|accessdate=3 May 2012|doi=10.1016/j.jspr.2011.01.004}}</ref>  Its overall protective effect varies with insect species and life stage. It affects certain species only in the adult stage, but can affect other species at more than one life stage. The species subject to very high rates of mortality as larvae, but not as adults, may gradually be controlled through sustained larval mortality.<ref name=three />  The mode of action of spinosoid insecticides is by a neural mechanism.<ref name=two>{{cite journal|last=Orr|first=Nailah|author2=Andrew J. Shaffner |author3=Kimberly Richey |author4=Gary D. Crouse |title=Novel mode of action of spinosad: Receptor binding studies demonstrating lack of interaction with known insecticidal target sites|journal=Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology|date=30 April 2009|volume=95|pages=1–5|doi=10.1016/j.pestbp.2009.04.009}}</ref>  The spinosyns and spinosoids have a novel mode of action, primarily targeting binding sites on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) of the insect nervous system that are distinct from those at which other insecticides have their activity. Spinosoid binding leads to disruption of acetylcholine neurotransmission.<ref name=four /> Spinosad also has secondary effects as a  Ɣ-amino-butyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter agonist.<ref name=four /> It kills insects by hyperexcitation of the insect nervous system.<ref name=four /> Spinosad so far has proven not to cause cross-resistance to any other known insecticide.<ref name=six>{{cite journal|last=Sparks|first=Thomas|author2=Gary D crouse |author3=Gregory Durst |title=Natural products as insecticides: the biology, biochemistry and quantitative structure-activity relationships of spinosyns and spinosoids|journal=pest manag sci|date=30 March 2001|volume=57|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref>

==Use==
Spinosad has been used around the world for the control of a variety of insect pests, including [[Lepidoptera]], [[Diptera]], [[Thysanoptera]], [[Coleoptera]], [[Orthoptera]], and [[Hymenoptera]], and many others.<ref name=eight>{{cite journal|last=Sparks|first=Thomas|author2=James E. Dripps |author3=Gerald B Watson |author4=Doris Paroonagian |title=Resistance and cross-resistance to the spinosyns- A review and analysis|journal=Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology|date=6 November 2012|pages=1–10|url=http://www.elsevier.com/locate/pest|accessdate=17 November 2011}}</ref>  It was first registered as a pesticide in the United States for use on crops in 1997.<ref name=eight />  Its labeled use rate is set at 1 ppm (1&nbsp;mg a.i./kg of grain) and its maximum residue limit (MRL) or tolerance is set at 1.5 ppm. Spinosad’s widespread commercial launch was deferred, awaiting final MRL or tolerance approvals in a few remaining grain-importing countries. It is considered a natural product, thus is approved for use in organic agriculture by numerous nations.<ref name=three /> Two other uses for spinosad are for pets and humans. Spinosad has recently been used in oral preparations to treat ''[[Ctenocephalides felis|C. felis]]'', the cat flea, in canines and felines; the optimal dose set for canines is reported to be 30&nbsp;mg/kg.<ref name=four />

Trade names include Comfortis and Trifexis (which also includes [[milbemycin oxime]]) (both brands treat adult fleas on pets; the latter also prevents [[Dirofilaria immitis|heartworm disease]]), and Natroba (for human head lice).   It is commonly used to kill [[thrips]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/ingredient/spinosad.html |title=Spinosad - brand name list from |publisher=Drugs.com |accessdate=2012-10-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/vmth/small_animal/dermatology/newsletters.cfm |title=UC Davis School of Vet Med: |publisher=Vetmed.ucdavis.edu |accessdate=2012-10-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://citybugs.tamu.edu/factsheets/biting-stinging/others/ent-3001/ |title=Safer Flea Control &#124; Insects in the City |publisher=Citybugs.tamu.edu |accessdate=2012-10-20}}</ref>

==Spinosyn A==
Spinosyn A does not appear to interact directly with known insecticidal-relevant target sites, but rather acts via a novel mechanism.<ref name=two /> Spinosyn A resembles a GABA antagonist and is comparable to the effect of [[Avermectin]] on insect neurons.<ref name=five /> Spinosyn A is highly active against neonate larvae of the tobacco budworm, ''[[Heliothis virescens]]'', and is slightly more biologically active than spinosyn D. In general, spinosyns possessing a methyl group at C6 (spinosyn D-related analogs) tend to be more active and less affected by changes in the rest of the molecule.<ref name= six /> Spinosyn A is slow to penetrate to the internal fluids of larvae; it is also poorly metabolized once it enters the insect.<ref name=six /> The apparent lack of spinosyn A metabolism may contribute to its high level of activity, and may compensate for the slow rate of penetration.<ref name=six />

==Safety and ecotoxicology==
Spinosad has high efficacy, a broad insect pest spectrum, low mammalian toxicity, and a good environmental profile, a unique feature of the insecticide compared to others currently used for the protection of grain products.<ref name=three /> It is regarded as [[natural product]]-based, and approved for use in organic agriculture by numerous national and international certifications.<ref name=eight /> Spinosad residues are highly stable on grains stored in bins, with protection ranging from 6 months to 2 years.<ref name=three />{{what?|date=June 2014}}{{vague|date=June 2014}}

Even dried residues have been observed to be lethal to honeybee colonies, whereby honeybees may take up residues from dried sprays in dew which may form on sprayed fruit, foliage, etc. Of 12 hives which were so affected in western Massachusetts in the first week of June, 2015, only two were considered strong when heading into winter, whereas four hives collapsed outright. None of the affected hives was expected to winter over successfully.
An unblinded study performed on groups of 10 rats per dose level run using direct oral doses of commercially prepared insectide found some effects at higher doses, but confirmed that spinosad had much less negative effects than [[malathion]].<ref>S.A.
