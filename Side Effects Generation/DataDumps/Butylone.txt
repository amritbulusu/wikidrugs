'''Butylone''', also known as '''β-keto-''N''-methylbenzodioxolylbutanamine''' ('''βk-MBDB'''), is an [[entactogen]], [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]], and [[stimulant]] [[psychoactive drug]] of the [[substituted phenethylamine|phenethylamine]] [[chemical class]]. It is the β-keto ([[substituted cathinone]]) [[analogue (chemistry)|analogue]] of [[1,3-Benzodioxolyl-N-methylbutanamine|MBDB]] and the [[substituted methylenedioxyphenethylamine]] analogue of [[buphedrone]].

== History ==

Butylone was first [[Chemical synthesis|synthesized]] by Koeppe, Ludwig and Zeile which is mentioned in their 1967 paper. It remained an obscure product of academia until 2005 when it was sold as a [[designer drug]].<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/yakushi/128/10/128_10_1499/_article/-char/ja/ | title=2006年度買い上げ違法ドラッグ製品から検出されたデザイナードラッグ成分のNMRを中心とした分析 | date=October 2008 | journal=Yakugaku Zasshi | vauthors=Uchiyama N, Kikura-Hanajiri R, Kawahara N, Goda Y | volume=128 | issue=10 | pages=1499–15505 | doi=10.1248/yakushi.128.1499 | pmid=18827471 | language=Japanese}}</ref> Butylone shares the same relationship to MBDB as [[methylone]] does to [[MDMA]] ("Ecstasy"). Formal research on this chemical was first conducted in 2009, when it was shown to be metabolised in a similar manner to related drugs like [[methylone]].<ref name="pmid19406592">{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0379073809001558 | title=Determination of the metabolites of the new designer drugs bk-MBDB and bk-MDEA in human urine | date=July 2009 | journal=Forensic Science International | vauthors=Zaitsu K, Katagi M, Kamata HT, Kamata T, Shima N, Miki A, Tsuchihashi H, Mori Y | volume=188 | issue=1–3 | pages=131–139 | doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2009.04.001 | pmid=19406592}}</ref>

== Synthesis ==
Butylone can be synthesized in a laboratory via the following route:
3,4-methylenedioxybutyrophenone dissolved in dichloromethane to bromine gives 3′,4′-methylenedioxy-2-bromobutyrophenone. This product was then dissolved in dichloromethane and added to an aqueous solution of methylamine (40%). HCl was then added. The aqueous layer was removed and made alkaline by using sodium bicarbonate. For the extraction of the amine ether was used. To get butylone a drop of ether and HCl solution was added.<ref name="López">{{cite journal | title=Comparative neuropharmacology of three psychostimulant cathinone derivatives: butylone, mephedrone and methylone | date=September 2012 | author=López, Arnau R. | author2=Martínez, Clemente J. | author3=Pubill D. | author4=Escubedo E. | author5=Camarasa J. | journal=British Journal of Pharmacology | volume=167 | issue=2 | pages=407–420 | doi=10.1111/j.1476-5381.2012.01998.x | pmc=3481047 | pmid=22509960}}</ref>

== Metabolism ==
There are three major metabolic pathways of bk-MBDB as shown in the figure. As result of demethylenation followed by O-methylation bk-MBDB metabolises into 4-OH-3-MeO and 3-OH-4-MeO metabolites in human urine. The second pathway is a β-ketone reduction into β-ketone reduced metabolites. The third pathway is a N-dealkylation into N-dealkyl metabolites. The first two pathways occur more than pathway three. The most common metabolite is the 4-OH-3-MeO metabolite. The metabolites containing a hydroxyl-group would be excreted as their conjugates in urine.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/s13181-011-0193-z | pmc=3550219 | title=The Toxicology of Bath Salts: A Review of Synthetic Cathinones | date=March 2012 | journal=Journal of Medical Toxicology | volume=8 | issue=1 | pages=33–42 | pmid=22108839 | vauthors=Prosser JM, Nelson LS}}</ref>

== Mechanism of action ==
Butylone acts in a similar way as MDMA and Methylone, it causes an increase in extracellular monoamine levels.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.bcp.2013.04.004 | pmc=3692398 | title=Substituted methcathinones differ in transporter and receptor interactions | journal=Biochemical Pharmacology | date=June 2013 | volume=85 | issue=12 | pages=1803–1815 | pmid=23583454 | vauthors=Eshleman AJ, Wolfrum KM, Hatfield MG, Johnson RA, Murphy KV, Janowsky A}}</ref><ref name="López"/>
