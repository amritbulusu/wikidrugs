{{as of|2013|12}}, olodaterol is not approved for the treatment of [[asthma]]. Olodaterol monotherapy was previously evaluated in four [[Phases of clinical research|Phase II]] studies in asthma patients. However, currently there are no Phase III studies planned for olodaterol monotherapy in patients with asthma.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Adverse effects==
Adverse effects generally were rare and mild in clinical studies. Most common, but still affecting no more than 1% of patients, were [[Common cold|nasopharyngitis (running nose)]], [[dizziness]] and [[rash]]. To judge from the drug's mechanism of action and from experiences with related drugs, [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure), [[tachycardia]] (fast heartbeat), [[hypokalemia]] (low blood levels of [[potassium]]), [[Tremor|shaking]], etc., might occur in some patients, but these effects have rarely, if at all, been observed in studies.<ref name="UK-leaflet" />

==Interactions==
Based on theoretical considerations, co-application of other [[beta-adrenoceptor agonist]]s, potassium lowering drugs (e.g. [[corticosteroid]]s, many [[diuretic]]s, and [[theophylline]]), [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s, and [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s could increase the likelihood of adverse effects to occur. [[Beta blocker]]s, a group of drugs for the treatment of [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure) and various conditions of the heart, could reduce the efficacy of olodaterol.<ref name="UK-leaflet" /> Clinical data on the relevance of such interactions are very limited.

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===
Like all [[Beta-adrenergic agonist|β adrenoreceptor agonist]]s, olodaterol mimics the effect of [[epinephrine]] at [[Beta2-adrenergic agonist|β<sub>2</sub> receptor]]s in the lung, which causes the [[bronchi]] to relax and reduces their resistance to airflow.<ref name="Casarosa" />

Olodaterol is a nearly full β<sub>2</sub> agonist, having 88% [[intrinsic activity]] compared to the gold standard [[isoprenaline]]/isoproterenol). Its [[EC50|half maximal effective concentration]] (EC<sub>50</sub>) is 0.1 [[Molar concentration|nM]]. It has a higher ''[[in vitro]]'' selectivity for β<sub>2</sub> receptors than the related drugs [[formoterol]] and [[salmeterol]]: 241-fold versus [[Beta-1 adrenergic receptor|β<sub>1</sub>]] and 2299-fold versus [[Beta-3 adrenergic receptor|β<sub>3</sub> adrenergic receptor]]s.<ref name="Bouyssou" /> The high β<sub>2</sub>/β<sub>1</sub> selectivity may account for the apparent lack of tachycardia in clinical trials, which is mediated by β<sub>1</sub> receptors on the heart.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Olodaterol is substantially metabolized by glucuronidation ([[UGT2B7]], [[UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1|UGT1A1]], [[UGT1A9]]) and ''O''-demethylation ([[CYP2C8]], [[CYP2C9]]).<ref name="PI" />

===Pharmadynamics===
Once bound to a β<sub>2</sub> receptor, an olodaterol molecule stays there for hours — its dissociation half-life is 17.8 hours —, which allows for once-a-day application of the drug<ref name="Casarosa" /> like with [[indacaterol]]. Other related compounds generally have a shorter duration of action and have to be applied twice daily (e.g. formoterol, salmeterol). Still others (e. g. [[Salbutamol|salbutamol/аlbuterol]], [[fenoterol]]) have to be applied three or four times a day for continuous action, which can also be an advantage for patients who need to apply β<sub>2</sub> agonists only occasionally, for example in an [[asthma]] attack.<ref name="AustriaCodex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2009|edition=2009/2010|isbn=3-85200-196-X|language=German}}</ref>

==History==
On 29 January 2013 the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee (PADAC) recommended that the clinical data included in the [[new drug application]] (NDA) for olodaterol provide substantial evidence of safety and efficacy to support the approval of olodaterol as a once-daily maintenance [[bronchodilator]] treatment for airflow obstruction in patients with COPD.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fdanews.com/newsletter/article?articleId=152790&issueId=16510|author=Hollis A|title=Panel Overwhelmingly Supports Boehringer COPD Drug Striverdi|publisher=FDA News/Drug Industry Daily|date=31 January 2013}}</ref>

On 18 October 2013 approval of olodaterol in the first three European countries — the United Kingdom, Denmark and Iceland — was announced by the manufacturer.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.boehringer-ingelheim.com/news/news_releases/press_releases/2013/18_october_2013_olodaterol.html|title=New once-daily Striverdi (olodaterol) Respimat gains approval in first EU countries|publisher=Boehringer-Ingelheim|date=18 October 2013}}</ref>

On July 31, 2014 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Striverdi Respimat (olodaterol inhalation spray) to treat patients with [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema that are experiencing airflow obstruction.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm407465.htm|title=FDA approves Striverdi Respimat to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|publisher=FDA News/Drug Industry Daily|date=31 July 2014}}</ref>
