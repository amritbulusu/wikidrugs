'''Fluprazine''' ('''DU-27,716''') is a [[drug]] of the [[phenylpiperazine]] class. It is a so-called [[serenic]] or anti[[aggressive]] agent.<ref name="pmid6889746">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0091-3057(82)90277-5 |vauthors=van der Poel AM, Olivier B, Mos J, Kruk MR, Meelis W, van Aken JH | title = Anti-aggressive effect of a new phenylpiperazine compound (DU27716) on hypothalamically induced behavioural activities. | journal = Pharmacol Biochem Behav. | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 147â€“153 | year = 1982 | pmid = 6889746 }}</ref> It is closely related to several other piperazines, including [[eltoprazine]] and [[batoprazine]], and [[TFMPP]], as well as more distantly to the [[azapirone]]s such as [[buspirone]]. The pharmacology of fluprazine is unknown, but it is likely to act as an [[agonist]] at the [[5-HT1A|5-HT<sub>1A</sub>]] and [[5-HT1B|5-HT<sub>1B</sub>]] receptors like its sister compound eltoprazine.
