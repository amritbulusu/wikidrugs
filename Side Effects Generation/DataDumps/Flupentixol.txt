'''Flupentixol''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]), also known as '''flupenthixol''' (former [[British Approved Name|BAN]]), marketed under brand names such as '''Depixol''' and '''Fluanxol''' is a [[typical antipsychotic]] [[drug]] of the [[thioxanthene]] class. It was introduced in 1965 by Lundbeck. In addition to single drug preparations, it is also available as [[flupentixol/melitracen]]—a [[Combination drug|combination product]] containing both [[melitracen]] (a [[tricyclic antidepressant]]) and flupentixol.
Flupentixol is  not approved for use in the United States. It is, however, approved for use in the [[United Kingdom|UK]],<ref name="BNF">{{cite book | isbn = 978-0-85711-084-8 | title = British National Formulary (BNF) | last1 = Joint Formulary Committee | year = 2013 | publisher = Pharmaceutical Press | location = London, UK | edition = 65  | pages =  }}</ref> [[Australia]],<ref name="AMH">{{cite book | editor = Rossi, S | isbn = 978-0-9805790-9-3 | title = Australian Medicines Handbook | place = Adelaide | publisher = The Australian Medicines Handbook Unit Trust | year = 2013 | edition = 2013 }}</ref> [[Canada]], [[Russian Federation]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Fluanxol® (flupentixol) Tablets Registration Certificate|url=http://grls.rosminzdrav.ru/Grls_View.aspx?idReg=5644&isOld=1&t=|publisher=Russian State Register of Medicinal Products|accessdate=29 July 2014}}</ref> [[South Africa]], [[New Zealand]], [[Philippines]] and various other countries.

== Medical uses ==
Flupentixol's main use is as a long-acting injection given once in every two or three weeks to individuals with [[schizophrenia]] who have poor compliance with medication and suffer frequent relapses of illness, though it is also commonly given as a tablet. There however is little evidence to support its use for this indication.<ref name = BNF/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Shen|first=X|author2=Xia, J|author3=Adams, CE|title=Flupenthixol versus placebo for schizophrenia|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|date=Nov 14, 2012|volume=11|pages=CD009777|pmid=23152280|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009777.pub2|editor1-last=Shen|editor1-first=Xiaohong}}</ref>

Flupentixol is also used in low doses as an [[antidepressant]].<ref name = BNF/><ref name="pmid7291129">{{cite journal |vauthors=Robertson MM, Trimble MR | title = The antidepressant action of flupenthixol | journal = The Practitioner | volume = 225 | issue = 1355 | pages = 761–3 |date=May 1981 | pmid = 7291129 | doi = | url = }}</ref><ref name="pmid6674820">{{cite journal |vauthors=Pöldinger W, Sieberns S | title = Depression-inducing and antidepressive effects of neuroleptics.

;Common (>1% incidence) adverse effects include:
* Extrapyramidal side effects such as: (which ''usually'' become apparent soon after therapy is begun or soon after an increase in dose is made)
:- Muscle rigidity
:- [[Hypokinesia]]
:- [[Hyperkinesia]]
:- [[Parkinsonism]]
:- Tremor
:- [[Akathisia]]
:- [[Dystonia]]
* Dry mouth
* Constipation
* Hypersalivation — excessive salivation
* Blurred vision
* Diaphoresis — excessive sweating
* Nausea
* Dizziness
* [[Somnolence]]
* Restlessness
* Insomnia
* Overactivity
* Headache
* Nervousness
* Fatigue
* Myalgia
* [[Hyperprolactinemia]] and its complications such as: (''acutely'')
:- Sexual dysfunction
:- Amenorrhea — cessation of menstrual cycles
:- Gynecomastia — enlargement of breast tissue in males
:- Galactorrhea — the expulsion of breast milk that's not related to breastfeeding or pregnancy
: and if the hyperprolactinemia persists ''chronically'', the following adverse effects may be seen:
:- Reduced bone mineral density leading to [[osteoporosis]] (brittle bones)
:- Infertility
* Dyspepsia — indigestion
* Abdominal pain
* Flatulence
* Nasal congestion
* Polyuria — passing more urine than usual

;Uncommon (0.1–1% incidence) adverse effects include:
* Fainting
* Palpitations

;Rare (<0.1% incidence) adverse effects include:
* Blood dyscrasias (abnormalities in the cell composition of blood), such as:
:- [[Agranulocytosis]] — a drop in white blood cell counts that leaves one open to potentially life-threatening infections
:- [[Neutropenia]] — a drop in the number of [[neutrophils]] (white blood cells that specifically fight bacteria) in one's blood
:- [[Leucopenia]] — a less severe drop in white blood cell counts than agranulocytosis
:- [[Thrombocytopenia]] — a drop in the number of platelets in the blood. Platelets are responsible for blood clotting and hence this leads to an increased risk of bruising and other bleeds
* [[Neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] — a potentially fatal condition that appear to result from central [[Dopamine D2 receptor|D<sub>2</sub> receptor]] blockade. The symptoms include:
:- [[Hyperthermia]]
:- Muscle rigidity
:- [[Rhabdomyolysis]]
:- Autonomic instability (e.g. tachycardia, diarrhea, diaphoresis, etc.)
:- Mental status changes (e.g. coma, agitation, anxiety, confusion, etc.)

;Unknown incidence adverse effects include:
* Jaundice
* Abnormal liver function test results
* [[Tardive dyskinesia]] — an often incurable movement disorder that usually results from years of continuous treatment with antipsychotic drugs, especially [[typical antipsychotics]] like flupenthixol. It presents with repetitive, involuntary, purposeless and slow movements
* Hypotension
* Confusional state
* Seizures
* [[Mania]]
* [[Hypomania]]
* [[Depression (mood)|Depression]]
* Hot flush
* Anergia
* Appetite changes
* Weight changes
* Hyperglycemia — high blood glucose (sugar) levels
* Abnormal glucose tolerance
* Pruritus — itchiness
* Rash
* Dermatitis
* Photosensitivity — sensitivity to light
* Oculogyric crisis
* Accommodation disorder
* Sleep disorder
* Impaired concentration
* Tachycardia
* [[QTc interval]] prolongation — an abnormality in the electrical activity of the heart that can lead to potentially fatal changes in heart rhythm
* [[Torsades de pointes]]
* Miosis — constriction of the pupil of the eye
* Paralytic [[ileus]] — paralysis of the bowel muscles leading to severe constipation, inability to pass wind, etc.
* Mydriasis
* [[Glaucoma]]

===Interactions===
It should not be used concomitantly with medications known to prolong the QTc interval (e.g. [[5-HT3 antagonist]]s, [[tricyclic antidepressants]], [[citalopram]], etc.) as this may lead to an increased risk of QTc interval prolongation.<ref name = "
FLUANXOL"/><ref name = EMC/> Neither should it be given concurrently with [[lithium (medication)]] as it may increase the risk of lithium toxicity and [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]].<ref name = BNF/><ref name = AMH/><ref name = FLUANXOL/> It should not be given concurrently with other antipsychotics due to the potential for this to increase the risk of side effects, especially neurological side effects such as [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]].<ref name = BNF/><ref name = AMH/><ref name = FLUANXOL/> It should be avoided in patients on CNS depressants such as opioids, alcohol and barbiturates.<ref name = FLUANXOL/>

===Contraindications===
It should not be given in the following disease states:<ref name = EMC/><ref name = BNF/><ref name = AMH/><ref name = FLUANXOL/>
* [[Pheochromocytoma]]
* Prolactin-dependent tumors such as pituitary [[prolactinoma]]s and [[breast cancer]]
* [[Long QT syndrome]]
* Coma
* Circulatory collapse
* Subcortical brain damage
* [[Blood dyscrasia]]
* Parkinson's disease
* [[Dementia with Lewy bodies]]

Its antipsychotic effects are likely caused by D<sub>2</sub> and/or 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> antagonism, whereas its antidepressant effects at lower doses may be mediated by preferential D<sub>2</sub>/D<sub>3</sub> [[autoreceptor]] blockade, resulting in increased postsynaptic activation.
