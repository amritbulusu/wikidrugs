== Controversies ==

===Seroquel===

In April 2010 AstraZeneca settled a ''[[qui tam]]'' lawsuit brought by [[Stefan P. Kruszewski]] for $520&nbsp;million to settle allegations that the company defrauded [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]], and other government-funded health care programs in connection with its marketing and promotional practices for the blockbuster atypical antipsychotic, [[Seroquel]].<ref>[http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/April/10-civ-487.html Pharmaceutical Giant AstraZeneca to Pay $520 Million for Off-label Drug Marketing] U.S. Department of Justice, 27 April 2010</ref>

In March 2011, AstraZeneca settled a [[lawsuit]] in the United States totalling $68.5&nbsp;million to be divided up to 38 states.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20110311/BUSINESS/103110347/1017/SPORTS06/?odyssey|title=Drugmaker settles lawsuits over Seroquel| publisher=The Des Moines Register|accessdate=1 March 2011}}{{dead link|date=June 2014}} {{Dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref>

===Nexium===
The company's most commercially successful medication is [[esomeprazole]] (Nexium). The primary uses are treatment of [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]], treatment and maintenance of [[erosive esophagitis]], treatment of [[duodenal ulcers]] caused by ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'', prevention of [[gastric ulcers]] in those on chronic [[NSAID]] therapy, and treatment of gastrointestinal ulcers associated with [[Crohn's disease]]. When it is manufactured the result is a mixture of two [[enantiomer|mirror-imaged molecules]], R and S. Two years before the omeprazole patent expired, AstraZeneca patented S-omeprazole in pure form, pointing out that since some people metabolise R-omeprazole slowly, pure S-omeprazole treatment would give higher dose efficiency and less variation between individuals.<ref>[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&d=PALL&RefSrch=yes&Query=PN%2F5877192 United States Patent 5,877,192] USPTO Patent Database, 11 April 1997</ref> In March 2001, the company began to market [[Esomeprazole|Nexium]], as it would a brand new drug.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/10/25/041025crat_atlarge?currentPage=all|title=High Prices|date=25 October 2004|work=The New Yorker}}</ref>

The (R)-entantiomer of omeprazole is metabolized exclusively by the enzyme CYP2C19, which is expressed in very low amounts by 3% of the population.  Treated with a normal dose of the enantiomeric mixture, these persons will experience blood levels five-times higher than those with normal CYP2C19 production. In contrast, esomeprazole is metabolized by both CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, providing less-variable drug exposure.<ref>Lemke TL, Williams DA, Roche VF, Zito SW.

In 2007, [[Marcia Angell]], former [[editor in chief|editor-in-chief]] of the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' and a lecturer in [[social medicine]] at the [[Harvard Medical School]], said in ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'', a German-language weekly newsmagazine, that AstraZeneca's scientists had misrepresented their research on the drug's efficiency, saying "Instead of using presumably comparable doses [of each drug], the company's scientists used Nexium in higher dosages. They compared 20 and 40 mg Nexium with 20 mg [[Prilosec]]. With the cards having been marked in that way, Nexium looked like an improvement – which however was only small and shown in only two of the three studies."<ref>Grill, Markus and Hansen, Hans (2007): ''"Vorsicht, Pharma! Wie die Industrie Ärzte manipuliert und Patienten täuscht."'' ('Caution, Pharma! How the industry manipulates physicians and deceives patients.') Published in the 16 August 2007 issue of ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'' (Germany; ''pp. 100–107'').

===Bildman fraud===
On 4 February 1998, Astra USA sued Lars Bildman, its former president and chief executive officer, seeking $15&nbsp;million for [[Fraud|defrauding]] the company.<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/feb1998/nf80204e.htm Astra hauls ex-CEO Lars Bildman into court] Business Week, 4 February 1998</ref> The sum included $2.3&nbsp;million in company funds he allegedly used to fix up three of his homes, plus money the company paid as the result of the EEOC investigation. Astra's lawsuit alleged Bildman sexually harassed and intimidated employees, used company funds for [[yacht]]s and prostitutes, destroyed [[document]]s and [[business record|record]]s, and concocted "tales of [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] involving ex-[[KGB]] [[espionage|agent]]s and competitors. This was in a last-ditch effort to distract attention from the real wrongdoer, Bildman himself." Bildman had already [[pleaded guilty]] in [[US District Court]] for failing to report more than $1&nbsp;million in income on his [[Tax return (United States)|tax return]]s; in addition, several female co-workers filed personal sexual-harassment lawsuits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/astra-boss-hit-with-7m-fine-for-sex-harassment-reps-share-memories-of-bonkers-ceo/|title=Astra Boss Hit With $7M Fine for Sex Harassment; Reps Share Memories of Bonkers CEO|date=6 October 2009|publisher=CBS|accessdate=19 March 2016}}</ref>

===Doping in cycling===
On July 27, 2015, [[Fabio Taborre]] ([[Androni-Sidermec]]) returned a positive doping test result for the banned blood-booster [[FG-4592]] in an out-of-competition control on June 16, 2015. FG-4592 ([[Roxadustat]]) is in phase 3 clinical trials and has not yet been commercialised. The drug was developed jointly by FibroGen and AstraZeneca. Unlike [[Erythropoietin]] (EPO), which directly stimulates the production of red blood cells, FG-4592 is taken orally, and stimulates natural production of EPO in a manner similar to altitude training.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/taborre-positive-for-novel-epo-stimulating-drug-fg-4592/|title=Taborre positive for novel EPO stimulating drug FG-4592|author=Cycling News|work=Cyclingnews.com}}</ref>
