'''Colestilan''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], trade name '''BindRen''') is a [[medication]] that acts as a [[phosphate binder]]<ref name="Klement">{{cite journal| author = A.

}}</ref> It is an ion-exchange resin, is an orally administered bile acid sequestrant that is being developed by Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia and hyperphosphataemia. It has been launched in Japan for hypercholesterolaemia. For the treatment of hyperphosphataemia, it is launched in Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, Portugal and the United Kingdom, is registered in the EU. Phase III development in paediatric patients with hyperphosphataemia associated with chronic kidney disease was underway in the UK and Germany. However, the company discontinued the development. In addition, the phase II development in type-2 diabetes mellitus and phase I development in hyperphosphataemia, in Japan, was also discontinued by the company.<ref name=Spring>{{cite web|author=Adis International Ltd|title=Drug Profile:Colestilan|date=December 2, 2015|accessdate=December 16, 2015|work=AdisInsight.springer.com|url=http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800001537}}</ref>

Phase III development for hyperphosphataemia was previously underway in the US. However, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma discontinued development in this market. Colestilan was also investigated in phase III trials in Europe and Asia for hypercholesterolaemia. However, as of March 2015, no recent reports of development have been identified for the drug in this indication<ref name=Spring/>

==Clinical use==
Colestilan is used for the treatment of [[hyperphosphataemia]] (too high [[phosphate]] concentrations in the blood serum) in patients undergoing [[dialysis]], including [[peritoneal dialysis]].<ref name="Klement" /><ref name="AustriaCodex">{{cite book|title=Austria-Codex|at=BindRen 1&nbsp;g Filmtabletten|editor=Haberfeld, H|publisher=Österreichischer Apothekerverlag|location=Vienna|year=2013|language=German}}</ref>

==Contraindications==
Colestilan is contraindicated in patients with bowel obstruction.<ref name="AustriaCodex" />

==Interactions==
The substance can inhibit the resorption of other drugs, as well as fat soluble vitamins ([[vitamin A|A]], [[vitamin A|D]], [[vitamin A|E]], [[vitamin A|K]]) and [[folate]], from the gut.<ref name="Klement" /> Resulting lower blood levels can be clinically problematic with [[immunosuppressant]] and [[antiepileptic]] drugs.<ref name="AustriaCodex" />

==Adverse effects==
Adverse effects include [[gastrointestinal problem]]s such as constipation, as well as vitamin and [[calcium]] deficiency. Vitamin K deficiency sometimes causes gastrointestinal bleeding.<ref name="Klement" /><ref name="AustriaCodex" />

==Chemistry and mechanism of action==
Colestilan is a cross-linked [[copolymer]] of [[2-Methylimidazole|2-methylimidazole]] and [[epichlorohydrin]] and works as an [[anion exchanger]] resin with affinity to [[phosphate]], [[bile acid]] anions and [[urate]]. It binds these anions in the gut and removes them from the [[enterohepatic circulation]]. Colestilan is not absorbed from the gut, but is excreted together with the bound anions.<ref name="Klement" />
