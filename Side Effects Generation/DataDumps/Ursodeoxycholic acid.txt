'''Ursodeoxycholic acid''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]] and [[Australian Approved Name|AAN]]), also known as '''ursodiol''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]) and the [[abbreviation]] '''UDCA''', from the root-word for bear [[urso]], as bear bile contains the substance, is one of the secondary [[bile acid]]s, which are metabolic byproducts of intestinal bacteria.

==Endogenous effects==
Primary bile acids are produced by the [[liver]] and stored in the [[gall bladder]]. When secreted into the intestine, primary bile acids can be metabolized into secondary bile acids by intestinal bacteria. Primary and secondary bile acids help the body [[digestion|digest]] [[fat]]s.  Ursodeoxycholic acid helps regulate [[cholesterol]] by reducing the rate at which the [[intestine]] absorbs cholesterol molecules while breaking up [[micelle]]s containing cholesterol.  Because of this property, ursodeoxycholic acid is used to treat (cholesterol) [[gallstone]]s non-surgically. It is also used to relieve itching in pregnancy for some women who suffer obstetric cholestasis.

While some bile acids are known to be colon tumor promoters (e.g. deoxycholic acid), others such as ursodeoxycholic acid are thought to be [[Chemoprophylaxis|chemopreventive]], perhaps by inducing cellular differentiation and/or cellular senescence in colon epithelial cells.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Akare S, Jean-Louis S, Chen W, Wood DJ, Powell AA, Martinez JD |title=Ursodeoxycholic acid modulates histone acetylation and induces differentiation and senescence |journal=International Journal of Cancer. Journal International Du Cancer |volume=119 |issue=12 |pages=2958–69 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17019713 |doi=10.1002/ijc.22231}}</ref>

It is believed to inhibit [[apoptosis]].<ref name="pmid19417220">{{cite journal |vauthors=Amaral JD, Viana RJ, Ramalho RM, Steer CJ, Rodrigues CM |title=Bile acids: regulation of apoptosis by ursodeoxycholic acid |journal=Journal of Lipid Research |volume=50 |issue=9 |pages=1721–34 |date=September 2009 |pmid=19417220 |doi=10.1194/jlr.R900011-JLR200 |pmc=2724780}}</ref>

Ursodeoxycholic acid has also been shown experimentally to suppress [[immune system|immune response]] such as immune cell [[phagocytosis]].  Prolonged exposure and/or increased quantities of systemic (throughout the body, not just in the digestive system) ursodeoxycholic acid can be toxic.<ref>Material Safety Data Sheet on Ursodiol MSDS. https://fscimage.fishersci.com/msds/70916.htm</ref>

==Medical uses==
An incomplete list of the current uses is as follows:

* Reduction in gallstone formation, either in patients with gallstones unfit for cholecystectomy, or obese patients undergoing rapid weight loss to prevent gallstone formation.<ref>https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ursodeoxycholic-acid-ursodiol-drug-information?source=preview&search=ursodeoxycholic%20acid&anchor=F232620#F232620</ref>
* For the treatment of [[primary biliary cholangitis]] (PBC).<ref>https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ursodeoxycholic-acid-ursodiol-drug-information?source=preview&search=ursodeoxycholic%20acid&anchor=F232620#F232620</ref>
* To aim to improve bile flow in patients with cystic fibrosis (controversial<ref>https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease?source=search_result&search=cystic%20fibrosis&selectedTitle=2~150#H106943356</ref>)
* In newborn infants with impaired bile flow<ref>https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-in-term-and-late-preterm-infants?source=see_link#H30</ref>
* After bariatric surgery, to prevent cholelithiasis due to the rapid weight loss with biliary cholesterol oversaturation and also biliary diskinesia secondary to abnormalities in cholecystokinin and biliary enervation. <ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0025733/</ref>

Meta-analyses have borne out conflicting results on the mortality benefit of UDCA in PBC, however analyses that exclude trials of short duration (i.e. < 2 years) have demonstrated a survival benefit and are generally considered more clinically relevant.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shi|first=Jian|last2=Wu|first2=Cheng|last3=Lin|first3=Yong|last4=Chen|first4=Yue-Xiang|last5=Zhu|first5=Liang|last6=Xie|first6=Wei-fen|date=2006-07-01|title=Long-term effects of mid-dose ursodeoxycholic acid in primary biliary cirrhosis: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=16863557|journal=The American Journal of Gastroenterology|volume=101|issue=7|pages=1529–38|doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.2006.00634.x|issn=0002-9270|pmid=16863557}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis?source=see_link#H6|title=Trials of ursodeoxycholic acid for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (primary biliary cirrhosis)|website=www.uptodate.com|access-date=2016-12-27}}</ref> A Cochrane systematic review in 2012 found no significant benefit in reducing mortality, the rate of liver transplantation, [[pruritus]] or fatigue.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rudic|first1=JS|last2=Poropat|first2=G|last3=Krstic|first3=MN|last4=Bjelakovic|first4=G|last5=Gluud|first5=C|title=Ursodeoxycholic acid for primary biliary cirrhosis.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=12 December 2012|volume=12|pages=CD000551|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000551.pub3|pmid=23235576}}</ref> Ursodiol is the only FDA approved drug to treat PBC but many patients do not respond; other treatments are under study.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bowlus|first1=CL|last2=Kenney|first2=JT|last3=Rice|first3=G|last4=Navarro|first4=R|title=Primary Biliary Cholangitis: Medical and Specialty Pharmacy Management Update.|journal=Journal of managed care & specialty pharmacy|date=October 2016|volume=22|issue=10-a-s Suppl|pages=S3-S15|doi=10.18553/jmcp.2016.22.10-a-s.s3|pmid=27700211}}</ref>

Ursodiol may be used for biliary stasis, [also known as intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, to relieve the symptoms of itching, and to decrease infant mortality rate, which is generally believed to be 10% when Urso is not administered in this fairly rare, and largely undiagnosed pregnancy related disorder. Maternal mortality from hemorrhage is another outcome of the disease, but Urso is not believed to be the preventive cure for this outcome], and to decrease bile absorption.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mayo Clinic Staff|title=Cholestasis of pregnancy: Treatment and Drugs|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/cholestasis-of-pregnancy/DS01033/DSECTION=treatments-and-drugs|publisher=Mayo Clinic}}</ref>

In children, ursodeoxycholic acid use is not licensed, as its safety and effectiveness have not been established. Evidence is accumulating that ursodeoxycholic acid is ineffective and unsafe in neonatal hepatitis and neonatal cholestasis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kotb MA |title=Review of historical cohort: ursodeoxycholic acid in extrahepatic biliary atresia |journal=Journal of Pediatric Surgery |volume=43 |issue=7 |pages=1321–27 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18639689 |doi=10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2007.11.043}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Paediatric Formulary Committee |title=British National Formulary for Children 2008 |publisher=Pharmaceutical Press |location=London |year=2008 |page=91 |isbn=0-85369-780-9}}</ref><ref>Urso package insert. Birmingham, AL: Axcan Pharma U.S.; 2000 Jan.http://www.axcan.com/pdf/urso_patient_brochure.pdf</ref>

There is insufficient evidence to justify routine use of ursodeoxycholic acid in cystic fibrosis, especially that available data for analysis of long-term outcomes such as death or need for liver transplantation is lacking.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cheng K, Ashby D, Smyth RL | date = Dec 2014 | title = Ursodeoxycholic acid for cystic fibrosis-related liver disease | url = | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev. | volume = 12 | issue = | page = CD000222 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD000222.pub3 | pmid = 25501301 }}</ref>

In double the recommended daily dose ursodeoxycholic acid reduces elevated liver enzyme levels in those with primary sclerosing cholangitis, but its use was associated with an increased risk of serious adverse events (the development of cirrhosis, varices, death or liver transplantation) in patients who received ursodeoxycholic acid compared with those who received placebo. Serious adverse events, were more common in the ursodeoxycholic acid group than the placebo group. The risk was 2.1 times greater for death, transplantation, or minimal listing criteria in patients on ursodeoxycholic acid than for those on placebo.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lindor KD |title=High-dose ursodeoxycholic acid for the treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis |journal=Hepatology |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=808–14 |date=September 2009 |pmid=19585548 |pmc=2758780 |doi=10.1002/hep.23082 |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Kowdley KV |author3=Luketic VA |display-authors=3 |last4=Harrison |first4=M.

It is concluded that ursodeoxycholic acid use is associated with improved serum liver tests that do not always correlate with improved liver disease status. WHO Drug Information advises against its use in primary sclerosing cholangitis in unapproved doses beyond 13–15&nbsp;mg/kg/day.<ref>http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/druginformation/issues/26-1.pdf</ref>

==Mechanism of action==
The drug reduces [[cholesterol]] absorption  and is used to dissolve (cholesterol) [[gallstone]]s in [[patient]]s who want an alternative to [[surgery]].  If the patient stops taking the drug the gallstones tend to recur if the condition that gave rise to their formation does not change.<ref>Public Assessment Report

Also used to relieve itching in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (naltrexone may also be used).
