<!-- History, society and culture -->
Triazolam was initially patented in 1970 and went on sale in the United States in 1982.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shorter|first1=Edward|title=A Historical Dictionary of Psychiatry|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780190292010|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=juAJCAAAQBAJ&pg=PT66|chapter=B}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
Triazolam is usually used for short-term treatment of acute [[insomnia]] and [[circadian rhythm sleep disorders]], including [[jet lag]]. It is an ideal benzodiazepine for this use because its fast onset of action and short half-life. It puts a person to sleep for not more than 1.5 hours (approximately 1–2 hours), allowing its user to avoid morning drowsiness. Triazolam is also sometimes used as an [[adjuvant]] in medical procedures requiring [[anesthesia]]<ref name="DrugBank" /> or to reduce anxiety during brief events like MRI scans and non-surgical dental procedures. Triazolam is ineffective in maintaining sleep however, due to its short half-life with [[quazepam]] showing superiority.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mauri MC, Gianetti S, Pugnetti L, Altamura AC |title=Quazepam versus triazolam in patients with sleep disorders: a double-blind study |journal=Int J Clin Pharmacol Res |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=173–7 |year=1993 |pmid=7901174 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

Triazolam is frequently prescribed as a sleep aid for passengers travelling on short to medium duration flights.  If this use is contemplated, it is especially important the user avoids the consumption of alcoholic beverages, and tries a ground based "rehearsal" of the medication to ensure that the side effects and potency of this medication are understood by the user prior to using it in a relatively more public environment (as [[disinhibition]] can be a common side effect, with potentially severe consequences). {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Side effects==
[[Adverse drug reactions]] associated with the use of triazolam include:

* Relatively common  (>1% of patients): [[somnolence]], [[dizziness]], feeling of lightness, coordination problems.
* Less common  (0.9% to 0.5% of patients): [[euphoria]], [[tachycardia]], tiredness, confusional states/memory impairment, cramps/pain, [[Depression (mood)|depression]], visual disturbances.
* Rare (<0.5% of patients): constipation, taste alteration, [[diarrhea]], dry mouth, [[dermatitis]]/allergy, dreams/nightmares, insomnia, [[parasthesia]], [[tinnitus]], [[dysesthesia]], weakness, congestion.<ref name="pfizer.com">http://www.pfizer.com/files/products/uspi_halcion.pdf</ref>

Triazolam, although a short-acting benzodiazepine, may cause residual impairment into the next day, especially the next morning. A [[meta-analysis]] demonstrated that residual "hangover" effects after nighttime administration of triazolam such as sleepiness, psychomotor impairment, and diminished [[cognitive]] functions may persist into the next day, which may impair the ability of users to drive safely and increase risks of falls and [[hip fractures]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Vermeeren A. | year = 2004 | title = Residual effects of hypnotics: epidemiology and clinical implications | journal = CNS Drugs. | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 297–328 | pmid = 15089115 | doi = 10.2165/00023210-200418050-00003 }}</ref> [[Confusion]] and [[amnesia]] have been reported.<ref>{{ cite journal |pmid=2068441 |url= |format= |year=1991 |last1=Lieberherr |first1=S |last2=Scollo-Lavizzari |first2=G |last3=Battegay |first3=R |title=Confusional states following administration of short-acting benzodiazepines (midazolam/triazolam) |volume=80 |issue=24 |pages=673–5 |journal=Schweizerische Rundschau fur Medizin Praxis = Revue suisse de médecine Praxis }}</ref>

===Tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal===
{{Main|Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome}}
A review of the literature found that long-term use of [[benzodiazepine]]s, including triazolam, is associated with [[drug tolerance]], [[drug dependence]], [[rebound insomnia]], and CNS related adverse effects. It recommended that benzodiazepine hypnotics are used at their lowest possible dose and for a short period of time. Non-pharmacological treatment options were found to yield sustained improvements in sleep quality.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kirkwood CK |title=Management of insomnia |journal=J Am Pharm Assoc (Wash) |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=688–96; quiz 713–4 |year=1999 |pmid=10533351 |doi= |url=}}</ref>  A worsening of insomnia ([[rebound insomnia]]) compared to baseline may occur after discontinuation of triazolam, even following short-term single-nightly-dose therapy.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kales A |author2=Scharf MB |author3=Kales JD |author4=Soldatos CR.  | date = 1979-04-20 | title = Rebound insomnia.

Other withdrawal symptoms can range from mild unpleasant feelings to a major withdrawal syndrome, including stomach cramps, vomiting, muscle cramps, sweating, tremor, and, in rare cases, convulsions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2008/017892s038lbl.pdf |title=www.accessdata.fda.gov |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

===Contraindications===
Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, [[alcoholic]]s, or other drug-dependent individuals and individuals with [[comorbid]] [[psychiatric disorders]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Authier | first1 = N. | last2 = Balayssac | first2 = D. | last3 = Sautereau | first3 = M. | last4 = Zangarelli | first4 = A. | last5 = Courty | first5 = P. | last6 = Somogyi | first6 = AA. | last7 = Vennat | first7 = B. | last8 = Llorca | first8 = PM. | last9 = Eschalier | first9 = A. | title = Benzodiazepine dependence: focus on withdrawal syndrome | journal = Ann Pharm Fr | volume = 67 | issue = 6 | pages = 408–13 |date=Nov 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharma.2009.07.001 | pmid = 19900604  }}</ref> Triazolam belongs to the Pregnancy Category X of the FDA.<ref>http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/SAFETY/2003/03Jun_PI/Halcion_PI.pdf</ref> This means that it is known to have the potential to cause [[birth defects]].

===Elderly===
Triazolam, similar to other benzodiazepines and [[nonbenzodiazepines]], causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. The combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial, but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments.<ref name="Mets-2010">{{Cite journal | last1 = Mets | first1 = MA. | last2 = Volkerts | first2 = ER. | last3 = Olivier | first3 = B. | last4 = Verster | first4 = JC. | title = Effect of hypnotic drugs on body balance and standing steadiness | journal = Sleep Med Rev | volume = 14 |date=Feb 2010 | issue = 4 | pages = 259–67 | doi = 10.1016/j.smrv.2009.10.008 | pmid = 20171127 }}</ref> There can be daytime withdrawal effects.<ref name = bayer>{{cite journal|last=Bayer|first=A.J.|author2=Bayer EM |author3=Pathy MSJ |author4=Stoker MJ. |title=A Double-Blind Controlled Study of Chlormethiazole and Triazolam in the Elderly.|journal=Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica|year=1986|volume=329|issue=suppl 329|pages=104–111|pmid=3529832|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.1986.tb10544.x}}</ref>

An extensive review of the medical literature regarding the management of insomnia and the elderly found that there is considerable evidence of the effectiveness and durability of non-drug treatments for insomnia in adults of all ages and that these interventions are underutilized. Compared with the benzodiazepines including triazolam, the [[nonbenzodiazepine]] sedative-hypnotics appeared to offer few, if any, significant clinical advantages in efficacy or tolerability in elderly persons. It was found that newer agents with novel mechanisms of action and improved safety profiles, such as the melatonin agonists, hold promise for the management of chronic insomnia in elderly people. Long-term use of sedative-hypnotics for insomnia lacks an evidence base and has traditionally been discouraged for reasons that include concerns about such potential adverse drug effects as cognitive impairment, anterograde amnesia, daytime sedation, motor incoordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls.<ref name="bayer"/> One study found no evidence of sustained hypnotic efficacy throughout the 9 weeks of treatment for triazolam.<ref name = bayer/>

In addition, the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of these agents remain to be determined. It was concluded that more research is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of treatment and the most appropriate management strategy for elderly persons with chronic insomnia.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Am J Geriatr Pharmacother |date=June 2006 | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 168–92 | title = Management of chronic insomnia in elderly persons | author = Bain KT | pmid = 16860264 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjopharm.2006.06.006}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==
The pharmacological effects of triazolam are similar to those of most other [[Benzodiazepine#Pharmacology|benzodiazepine]]s. Triazolam does not generate active metabolites.<ref name="DrugBank" /> Triazolam is a short acting benzodiazepine, is [[lipophilic]], and is metabolised hepatically via oxidative pathways. The main pharmacological effects of triazolam are the enhancement of the [[neurotransmitter]] [[GABA]] at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Oelschläger H. | date = 1989-07-04 | title = Chemical and pharmacologic aspects of benzodiazepines | journal = Schweiz Rundsch Med Prax. | volume = 78 | issue = 27–28 | pages = 766–72 | pmid = 2570451 | doi=}}</ref> The half-life of triazolam is only 2 hours making it a very short acting benzodiazepine drug.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bcnc.org.uk/equivalence.html | title = BENZODIAZEPINE EQUIVALENCY TABLE | accessdate = September 23, 2007 | author = Professor heather Ashton |date=April 2007 }}</ref> Triazolam has [[anticonvulsant]] effects on brain function.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Life Sci | date =  February 25, 1985 |  volume = 36| issue = 8| pages = 737–44| title = Effect of GABA agonists on the neurotoxicity and anticonvulsant activity of benzodiazepines| author = Chweh AY|author2=Swinyard EA |author3=Wolf HH |author4=Kupferberg HJ | pmid = 2983169 | doi = 10.1016/0024-3205(85)90193-6}}</ref>
