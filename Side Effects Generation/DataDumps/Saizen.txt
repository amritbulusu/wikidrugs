'''Saizen''' is a commercial preparation of [[Growth_hormone_treatment#Synthetic_HGH|synthetic somatropin]] ([[growth hormone]], a.k.a. GH). Manufactured by [[Merck Serono]], Saizen is produced by [[recombinant DNA]] technology from a [[mammal]]ian [[cell line]] (mouse C127) that was modified by the addition of the human GH [[gene]], resulting in an identical 191-[[amino acid]] sequence and structure.

==Usage==  	 
Saizen is injected. It is intended for long-term treatment of individuals who are growth hormone deficient. Saizen, like all synthetic somatropin, has special importance for children and adolescents whose growth failure is due to inadequate production of growth hormone.  Studies have shown that somatropin usage fails to produce athletic performance enhancement despite claims to the contrary. More recently, Saizen has been used in [[IVF]] protocols by a few physicians for female patients undergoing [[infertility]] treatment in an attempt to increase the number and quality of [[oocytes]] retrieved. 	 
It affects: 	 
*Tissue growth 	 
**Skeletal growth 	 
**Cell growth (especially muscle growth) 	 
**Organ growth 	 
*Metabolism 	 
**Protein metabolism 	 
**Carbohydrate metabolism 	 
**Lipid metabolism 	 
**Mineral metabolism 	 
**Connective tissue and bone metabolism 	 		 
Saizen usage should be performed under the regular guidance of a physician who is experienced in the diagnosis and management of [[growth hormone deficiency]]. 	 

Individuals with inadequate secretion of growth hormone sometimes experience fasting [[hypoglycemia]] that is improved by treatment with growth hormone. Using Saizen may decrease [[glucose]] tolerance. Because human growth hormone may induce a state of [[insulin]] resistance, patients should be observed for evidence of glucose intolerance. As with all human growth hormone supplementation, Saizen should be used with caution in patients with [[diabetes mellitus]] or a family history of diabetes mellitus.

==Warnings: Black-Market HGH==
Those seeking [[HGH]] (Human Growth Hormone) therapy without a prescription from licensed physicians must be aware that there are several fake HGH manufacturers floating around the web. Most of these manufacturers actually use a substance called [[Human chorionic gonadotropin|hCG]] (Human chorionic gonadotropin) and pass it off as Generic HGH, and since testing the HGH chemical substance is a very expensive process, the bootleggers know that most, if not all, of their customers wouldnâ€™t even attempt to test them.{{fact|date=January 2013}}


The majority of fake HGH on the market is manufactured in China only, The color of the caps on the bottles offers no discernible way to tell if it is real HGH or fake, Blue, Green, Grey, Red tops are all used and so the color of the top alone is not enough to prove or disprove if its real. It is always recommended to order from a reputable pharmacy.
