[[File:Cylmin 100mg by Tsuruhara.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Theophylline extended-release tablets in Japan]]
'''Theophylline''', also known as '''1,3-dimethylxanthine''', is a [[methylxanthine]] drug used in therapy for [[respiratory disease]]s such as [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) and [[asthma]] under a variety of brand names. As a member of the [[xanthine]] family, it bears structural and pharmacological similarity to [[theobromine]] and [[caffeine]], and is readily found in nature, and is present in [[tea]] (''[[Camellia sinensis]]'') and [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] (''[[Theobroma cacao]]''). A small amount of theophylline is one of the products of caffeine metabolic processing in the [[liver]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news-medical.net/health/Caffeine-Pharmacology.aspx |title= Caffeine Pharmacology |first= Ananya |last=Mandal |website=Website Medical News}}</ref>

== Medical uses ==
The main actions of theophylline involve:
* relaxing bronchial [[smooth muscle]]
* increasing heart muscle contractility and efficiency; as a positive [[inotrope]]
* increasing heart rate: (positive [[chronotropic]])<ref>[http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/96/1/260.abstract?ijkey=3d1da68d05ba3840295f835f12eb8b899200a1c7&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha Alboni et al.   Effects of Permanent Pacemaker and Oral Theophylline in Sick Sinus Syndrome  The THEOPACE Study: A Randomized Controlled Trial]</ref>
* increasing [[blood pressure]]
* increasing [[kidney|renal]] blood flow
* [[inflammation|anti-inflammatory]] effects
* [[central nervous system]] stimulatory effect mainly on the medullary [[respiratory center]].

The main therapeutic uses of theophylline are aimed at:
* chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ([[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]])
* [[asthma]]
* [[Apnea of prematurity|infant apnea]]
* Blocks the action of [[adenosine]]; an inhibitory neurotransmitter that induces sleep, contracts the smooth muscles and relaxes the cardiac muscle.

=== Uses under investigation ===
A clinical study reported in 2008 that theophylline was helpful in improving the sense of smell in study subjects with [[anosmia]].<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080407114619.htm For Some Who Have Lost Their Sense Of Smell, A Once Popular Asthma Drug Could Help. Science Daily, American Physiological Society]</ref>

==Adverse effects==
The use of theophylline is complicated by its interaction with various drugs and by the fact that it has a narrow [[therapeutic window]]. Its use must be monitored by direct measurement of serum theophylline levels to avoid [[toxicity]].  It can also cause nausea, diarrhea, increase in heart rate, [[arrhythmia|abnormal heart rhythms]], and CNS excitation (headaches, [[insomnia]], irritability, [[dizziness]] and [[lightheadedness]]).<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a681006.html MedlinePlus Drug Information: Theophylline<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.medicinenet.com/theophylline-oral_24_hour_tablet/article.htm THEOPHYLLINE - ORAL 24 HOUR TABLET (Uni-Dur) side effects, medical uses, and drug interactions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Seizures can also occur in severe cases of toxicity, and are considered to be a neurological emergency.<ref name="Yoshikawa-2007">{{cite journal | author = Yoshikawa H | title = First-line therapy for theophylline-associated seizures. | journal = Acta Neurol Scand | volume = 115 | issue = 4 Suppl | pages = 57–61 |date=Apr 2007 | pmid = 17362277 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0404.2007.00810.x }}</ref> Its toxicity is increased by [[erythromycin]], cimetidine, and [[fluoroquinolones]], such as [[ciprofloxacin]].

Theophylline has been shown to inhibit [[TGF-beta]]-mediated conversion of pulmonary fibroblasts into myofibroblasts in [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]] and [[asthma]] via cAMP-PKA pathway and suppresses COL1 mRNA, which codes for the protein [[collagen]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yano Y, Yoshida M, Hoshino S, Inoue K, Kida H, Yanagita M, Takimoto T, Hirata H, Kijima T | title = Anti-fibrotic effects of theophylline on lung fibroblasts | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 341 | issue = 3 | pages = 684–90 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16430859 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.01.018 }}</ref>

It has been shown that theophylline may reverse the clinical observations of steroid insensitivity in patients with COPD and asthmatics who are active smokers (a condition resulting in [[oxidative stress]]) via a distinctly separate mechanism. Theophylline ''in vitro'' can restore the reduced HDAC (histone deacetylase) activity that is induced by oxidative stress (i.e., in smokers), returning steroid responsiveness toward normal.<ref name=Ito>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ito K, Lim S, Caramori G, Cosio B, Chung KF, Adcock IM, Barnes PJ | title = A molecular mechanism of action of theophylline: Induction of histone deacetylase activity to decrease inflammatory gene expression | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 99 | issue = 13 | pages = 8921–6 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12070353 | pmc = 124399 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.132556899 }}</ref> Furthermore, theophylline has been shown to directly activate [[HDAC2]].<ref name=Ito/>  ([[Corticosteroid]]s switch off the inflammatory response by blocking the expression of inflammatory mediators through deacetylation of histones, an effect mediated via histone deacetylase-2 (HDAC2). Once deacetylated, DNA is repackaged so that the promoter regions of inflammatory genes are unavailable for binding of transcription factors such as [[NF-κB]] that act to turn on inflammatory activity.  It has recently been shown that the oxidative stress associated with cigarette smoke can inhibit the activity of HDAC2, thereby blocking the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids.)

== Natural occurrences ==
Theophylline is naturally found in [[cocoa bean]]s.  Amounts as high as 3.7&nbsp;mg/g have been reported in [[Criollo (cocoa bean)|Criollo]] cocoa beans.<ref name="ApgarTarka">{{Cite book

Trace amounts of theophylline are also found in brewed [[tea]], although brewed tea provides only about 1&nbsp;mg/L,<ref>[http://archive.food.gov.uk/maff/archive/food/infsheet/1997/no103/table2a.htm MAFF Food Surveillance Information Sheet]</ref> which is significantly less than a therapeutic dose.

==Pharmacokinetics==

===Absorption===
When theophylline is administered intravenously, [[bioavailability]] is 100%, as with all intravenously administered drugs.

===Distribution===
Theophylline is distributed in the extracellular fluid, in the placenta, in the mother's milk and in the central nervous system. The volume of distribution is 0.5 L/kg. The protein binding is 40%. The volume of distribution may increase in neonates and those suffering from cirrhosis or malnutrition, whereas the volume of distribution may decrease in those who are [[Obesity|obese]].

===Metabolism===
Theophylline is metabolized extensively in the liver (up to 70%). It undergoes [[N-demethylation|''N''-demethylation]] via [[cytochrome]] P450 [[CYP1A2|1A2]]. It is metabolized by parallel [[Order of reaction|zero order]] and [[Michaelis-Menten kinetics|Michaelis-Menten]] pathways. Metabolism may become saturated (non-linear), even within the therapeutic range. Small dose increases may result in disproportionately large increases in serum concentration. [[Methylation]] to caffeine is also important in the infant population. Smokers and people with hepatic (liver) impairment metabolize it differently. Both [[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]] and [[nicotine]] have been shown to increase the rate of theophylline metabolism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rxlist.com/marinol-drug/side-effects-interactions.htm|title=RxList Marinol Interactions|date=2008-05-29|accessdate=2013-06-02}} (accessdate may be 2013-02-06)</ref>

===Elimination===
Theophylline is excreted unchanged in the urine (up to 10%). Clearance of the drug is increased in children (age 1 to 12), teenagers (12 to 16), adult smokers, elderly smokers, as well as in [[cystic fibrosis]], and [[hyperthyroidism]]. Clearance of the drug is decreased in these conditions: elderly, acute congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, hypothyroidism and febrile viral illness.

The elimination [[half-life]] varies: 30 hours for premature neonates, 24 hours for neonates, 3.5 hours for children ages 1 to 9, 8 hours for adult non-smokers, 5 hours for adult smokers, 24 hours for those with [[hepatic impairment]], 12 hours for those with congestive heart failure [[NYHA]] class I-II, 24 hours for those with congestive heart failure NYHA class III-IV, 12 hours for the elderly.

==History==
Theophylline was first extracted from tea leaves and chemically identified around 1888 by the German biologist [[Albrecht Kossel]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kossel A | title = Über eine neue Base aus dem Pflanzenreich | journal = Ber.
