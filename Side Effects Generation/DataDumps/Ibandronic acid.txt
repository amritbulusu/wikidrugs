'''Ibandronic acid''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) or '''ibandronate sodium''' ([[United States Approved Name|USAN]]) is a potent [[bisphosphonate]] [[medication|drug]] developed by [[Hoffman La Roche]] and used in the prevention and treatment of [[osteoporosis]] and metastasis-associated skeletal fractures in people with cancer.<ref name="pmid18360577">{{cite journal |author=Bauss F, Schimmer RC |title=Ibandronate: the first once-monthly oral bisphosphonate for treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis |journal=Therapeutics and clinical risk management |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=3–18 |date=March 2006 |pmid=18360577 |pmc=1661644 |doi= |url=}}</ref> It may also be used to treat [[hypercalcaemia|hypercalcemia]] (elevated blood [[calcium]] levels).  

==Medical uses==

Ibandronate is indicated for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women.<ref name=AHFS>{{cite web|title=boniva|url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/boniva.html|work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref> In May 2003, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved Ibandronate as a daily treatment for post-menopausal osteoporosis. The basis for this approval was a three-year, [[randomized controlled trial|randomized]], [[double blind|double-blind]], [[placebo]]-controlled [[clinical trial|trial]] women with post-menopausal osteoporosis. Every participant also received daily oral doses of [[calcium]] and 400IUs [international units] of [[vitamin D]]. At the study's conclusion, both doses significantly reduced the occurrence risk of new vertebral fractures by 50–52 percent when compared to the effects of the placebo drug.  

Ibandronate is efficacious for the prevention of metastasis-related bone fractures in multiple myeloma, breast cancer, and certain other cancers.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sittig HB |title=Pathogenesis and bisphosphonate treatment of skeletal events and bone pain in metastatic cancer: focus on ibandronate |journal=Onkologie |volume=35 |issue=6 |pages=380–7 |year=2012 |pmid=22722461 |doi=10.1159/000338947 |url=}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
In 2008, the U.S [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) issued a communication warning of the possibility of severe and sometimes incapacitating bone, joint or muscle pain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm124165.htm|title=Information for Healthcare Professionals: Bisphosphonates (marketed as Actonel, Actonel+Ca, Aredia, Boniva, Didronel, Fosamax, Fosamax+D, Reclast, Skelid, and Zometa)|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=27 October 2010}}</ref> A study conducted by the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research concluded that long-term use of [[bisphosphonates]], including Boniva, may increase the risk of a rare but serious fracture of the femur.

==Brand names==
Ibandronic acid is marketed under the trade names Boniva in the USA, Bondronat in Europe, Bonviva in Asia, Ibandrix in Ecuador, Adronil in Pakistan, Bondrova in Bangladesh and Bonprove in Egypt.
