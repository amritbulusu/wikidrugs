== Mechanism of action ==
Prucalopride, a first in class dihydro-benzofuran-carboxamide, is a selective, high affinity [[serotonin]] ([[5-HT4 receptor|5-HT<sub>4</sub>]]) receptor agonist with enterokinetic activities.<ref name="SmPC">SmPC. Summary of product characteristics Resolor (prucalopride) October, 2009: '''1-9'''.</ref> Prucalopride alters colonic motility patterns via serotonin 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor stimulation: it stimulates colonic mass movements, which provide the main propulsive force for [[defecation]].

The observed effects are exerted via highly selective action on 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors:<ref name="SmPC" /> prucalopride has >150-fold higher affinity for 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors than for other receptors.<ref name="Briejer" /><ref name="DeMaeyer">{{cite journal|last1=De Maeyer|first1=JH|last2=Lefebvre|first2=RA|last3=Schuurkes|first3=JA|title=5-HT(4) receptor agonists: similar but not the same|journal=Neurogastroenterol Motil|date=Feb 2008|volume=20|issue=2|pages=99–112|pmid=18199093|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2982.2007.01059.x}}</ref> Prucalopride differs from other 5-HT<sub>4</sub> agonists such as [[tegaserod]] and [[cisapride]], which at therapeutic concentrations also  interact with other receptors (5-HT<sub>1B/D</sub> and the cardiac [[hERG|human ether-a-go-go K<sup>+</sup> or hERG channel]] respectively) and this may account for the adverse [[cardiovascular]] events that have resulted in the restricted availability of these drugs.<ref name="DeMaeyer" /> [[Clinical trials]] evaluating the effect of prucalopride on QT interval and related adverse events have not demonstrated significant differences compared with placebo.<ref name="SmPC" />

== Pharmacokinetics ==
Prucalopride is rapidly absorbed ([[CMax|C<sub>max</sub>]] attained 2–3 hours after single 2&nbsp;mg oral dose) and is extensively distributed. [[Metabolism]] is not the major route of elimination. ''In vitro'', human liver metabolism is very slow and only minor amounts of [[metabolite]]s are found. A large fraction of the active substance is excreted unchanged (about 60% of the administered dose in [[urine]] and at least 6% in [[feces]]). [[Renal excretion]] of unchanged prucalopride involves both passive filtration and active secretion. Plasma clearance averages 317 ml/min, terminal half-life is 24–30 hours,<ref>{{Cite journal

}}</ref> and steady-state is reached within 3–4 days. On once daily treatment with 2&nbsp;mg prucalopride, steady-state plasma concentrations fluctuate between trough and peak values of 2.5 and 7&nbsp;ng/ml, respectively.<ref name="SmPC" />

''In vitro'' data indicate that prucalopride has a low interaction potential, and therapeutic concentrations of prucalopride are not expected to affect the CYP-mediated metabolism of co-medicated medicinal products.<ref name="SmPC" />

== Efficacy ==
The primary measure of efficacy in the clinical trials is three or more spontaneous complete bowel movements per week; a secondary measure is an increase of at least one complete spontaneous bowel movement per week.<ref name="Tack" /><ref name="Camilleri">{{Cite journal

== Side effects ==
Prucalopride has been given orally to ~2700 patients with chronic constipation in controlled clinical trials. The most frequently reported side effects are [[headache]] and [[gastrointestinal symptom]]s (abdominal pain, [[nausea]] or [[diarrhea]]). Such reactions occur predominantly at the start of therapy and usually disappear within a few days with continued treatment.<ref name="SmPC" />

== Approval ==
In the [[European Economic Area]], prucalopride was originally approved for the [[symptomatic treatment]] of chronic constipation in women in whom [[laxatives]] fail to provide adequate relief.<ref name="SmPC" /> Subsequently, it has been approved by the European Commission for use in adults – that is, including male patients – for the same indication.<ref>https://www.shire.com/newsroom/2015/june/resolor-eu-male-indication-press-release</ref>

== Contraindications ==
Prucalopride is contraindicated where there is [[hypersensitivity]] to the active substance or to any of the [[excipients]], [[renal impairment]] requiring dialysis, [[intestinal]] [[intestinal perforation|perforation]] or [[intestinal obstruction|obstruction]] due to structural or functional disorder of the gut wall, obstructive ileus, severe inflammatory conditions of the [[intestinal tract]], such as [[Crohn's disease]], and [[ulcerative colitis]] and [[toxic megacolon]]/megarectum.<ref name="SmPC" />
