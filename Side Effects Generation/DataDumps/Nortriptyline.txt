'''Nortriptyline''', sold under the brand names '''Allegron''', '''Aventyl''', '''Noritren''', '''Nortrilen''', and '''Pamelor''' among others, is a [[tricyclic antidepressant]] (TCA) used to treat [[clinical depression]]. Another licensed use for it is in the treatment of childhood [[nocturnal enuresis|bedwetting]]. Off-label uses include [[chronic pain]] and [[migraine]] and [[labile affect]] in some neurological disorders.<ref name="MD">{{cite web|title=Nortriptyline Hydrochloride – Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference|url=https://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/martindale/current/2530-w.htm|date=9 January 2017|accessdate=11 August 2017|work=MedicinesComplete|publisher=Pharmaceutical Press|editor=Brayfield, A}}</ref> Chemically, it is a [[secondary amine]] [[dibenzocycloheptene]] and pharmacologically it is classed as a second-generation TCA.

Nortriptyline has less [[anticholinergic]] (like dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, ''etc.''), [[antihistamine]] (like [[sedation]] and possibly [[weight gain]]), [[antiadrenergic]] (like [[orthostatic hypotension|a drop in blood pressure upon standing up]]), and [[cardiotoxic]] (heart-toxic, namely the capacity of these drugs to interfere with normal heart rhythm) effects than the older first-generation TCAs.

Nortriptyline is the major [[active metabolite]] of [[amitriptyline]], a first-generation TCA. It is the ''N''-desmethyl metabolite of amitriptyline. Like amitriptyline it works by inhibiting the [[reuptake]] of [[serotonin]] and [[norepinephrine]] into the [[synapse]], thereby enhancing signalling via these neurotransmitters. It preferentially inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine over serotonin, which is the opposite to amitriptyline.<ref name="MD"/>

==Medical uses==
In the [[United Kingdom]], it may also be used for treating [[nocturnal enuresis]], with courses of treatment lasting no more than three months. It is also used [[off-label use|off-label]] for the treatment of [[panic disorder]], [[irritable bowel syndrome]], [[migraine]] prophylaxis and chronic pain or [[neuralgia]] modification, particularly [[temporomandibular joint disorder]].<ref name="Martindale2002-Sweetman">{{cite book | editor = Sweetman SC | title =Martindale. The complete drug reference | edition = 33 | year = 2002 | publisher = Pharmaceutical Press | isbn = 0-85369-499-0}}</ref>

===Neuropathic pain===
Although not approved by the FDA for [[neuropathic pain]], many randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of TCAs for the treatment of this condition in both depressed and non-depressed individuals. Recently, an evidence-based guideline sponsored by the International Association for the Study of Pain recommends nortriptyline as a first-line medication for neuropathic pain.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dworkin RH, O'Connor AB, Audette J, Baron R, Gourlay GK, Haanpää ML, Kent JL, Krane EJ, Lebel AA, Levy RM, Mackey SC, Mayer J, Miaskowski C, Raja SN, Rice AS, Schmader KE, Stacey B, Stanos S, Treede RD, Turk DC, Walco GA, Wells CD | title = Recommendations for the pharmacological management of neuropathic pain: an overview and literature update | journal = Mayo Clinic Proceedings | volume = 85 | issue = 3 Suppl | pages = S3-14 | date = Mar 2010 | pmid = 20194146 | pmc = 2844007 | doi = 10.4065/mcp.2009.0649 }}</ref>

==Contraindications==
Nortriptyline should not be used in the acute recovery phase after [[myocardial infarction]] (viz, heart attack). Unlike the TCAs clomipramine and imipramine, concurrent use of nortriptyline with [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s does not pose a risk of [[serotonin syndrome]], although there is still a risk of [[hypertensive crisis]].{{Mcn|date=August 2017}}

Closer monitoring is required for those with a history of cardiovascular disease, [[stroke]], [[glaucoma]], or [[seizures]], as well as in persons with [[hyperthyroidism]] or receiving thyroid hormones.

==Side effects==
The most common side effects include dry mouth, sedation, constipation, increased appetite, blurred vision and tinnitus.<ref name="MD"/><ref name="PI">{{cite web|title=ALLEGRON|website=TGA eBusiness Services|publisher=Arrow Pharma Pty Ltd|date=13 October 2016|accessdate=11 August 2017|url=https://www.ebs.tga.gov.au/ebs/picmi/picmirepository.nsf/pdf?OpenAgent&id=CP-2016-PI-02638-1}}</ref> An occasional side effect is a rapid or [[irregular heartbeat]]. Alcohol may exacerbate some of its side effects.<ref name="MD"/>

==Overdose==
{{Main|Tricyclic antidepressant overdose}}

The symptoms and the treatment of an overdose are generally the same as for the other TCAs, including [[serotonin syndrome]] and adverse cardiac effects. Because TCAs have a relatively narrow therapeutic index, the likelihood of serious overdose (both accidental and intentional) is fairly high. A nortriptyline overdose is considered a medical emergency and frequently results in death.

==Interactions==
Excessive consumption of alcohol in combination with nortriptyline therapy may have a potentiating effect, which may lead to the danger of increased suicidal attempts or overdosage, especially in patients with histories of emotional disturbances or [[suicidal ideation]].

Nortriptyline is an active metabolite of [[amitriptyline]] by demethylation in the liver. Its pharmacologic profile is as the table to the right shows (inhibition or antagonism of all sites).<ref name="PDSP" /><ref name = "GG">Brunton L, Chabner B, Knollman B. Goodman and Gilman’s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Twelfth Edition. McGraw Hill Professional; 2010.</ref>

These effects account for some therapeutic actions as well as for most side effects such as [[sedation]], [[hypotension]], [[anticholinergic]] effects, etc.{{Clarify|date=March 2016}} Nortriptyline may also have a sleep-improving effect due to antagonism of the H<sub>1</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors.<ref name="Dialogues Clin Neurosci-Thase">{{cite journal | vauthors = Thase ME | title = Depression and sleep: pathophysiology and treatment | journal = Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 217–26 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16889107 | pmc = 3181772 }}</ref> In the short term; however, nortriptyline may disturb sleep due to its activating effect.

Like other TCAs, nortriptyline also [[channel blocker|blocks]] [[sodium channel]]s, possibly accounting in part for its analgesic action.{{Medical citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In one study of long-term efficacy, nortriptyline showed a higher relapse rate in comparison with [[phenelzine]] in individuals being treated for depression, possibly due to the metabolite 10-hydroxynortriptyline being produced.<ref name="pmid9074307">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kennedy SH | title = Continuation and maintenance treatments in major depression: the neglected role of monoamine oxidase inhibitors | journal = Journal of Psychiatry & Neuroscience | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 127–31 | date = Mar 1997 | pmid = 9074307 | pmc = 1188835 }}</ref> The authors of a review noted that the nortriptyline group had more episodes prior to treatment.<ref name="pmid9074307"/>

In one study, nortriptyline had the highest affinity for the [[dopamine transporter]] among the TCAs (K<sub>D</sub> = 1,140&nbsp;nM) besides [[amineptine]] (a [[norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor]]), although its affinity for this transporter was still 261- and 63-fold lower than for the [[norepinephrine transporter|norepinephrine]] and [[serotonin transporter]]s (K<sub>D</sub> = 4.37 and 18&nbsp;nM, respectively).<ref name="pmid9537821" />

===Pharmacokinetics===

====Pharmacogenetics====
Nortriptyline is metabolized in the liver by the hepatic enzyme [[CYP2D6]], and genetic variations within the gene coding for this enzyme can affect its metabolism, leading to changes in the concentrations of the drug in the body.<ref name="pmid10319193">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rudorfer MV, Potter WZ | title = Metabolism of tricyclic antidepressants | journal = Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 373–409 | date = Jun 1999 | pmid = 10319193 }}</ref> Increased concentrations of nortriptyline may increase the risk for side effects, including anticholinergic and nervous system adverse effects, while decreased concentrations may reduce the drug's efficacy.<ref name="pmid 22565785">{{cite journal | vauthors = Stingl JC, Brockmöller J, Viviani R | title = Genetic variability of drug-metabolizing enzymes: the dual impact on psychiatric therapy and regulation of brain function | journal = Molecular Psychiatry | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 273–87 | date = Mar 2013 | pmid = 22565785 | doi = 10.1038/mp.2012.42 }}</ref><ref name="pmid 17113714">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kirchheiner J, Seeringer A | title = Clinical implications of pharmacogenetics of cytochrome P450 drug metabolizing enzymes | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1770 | issue = 3 | pages = 489–94 | date = Mar 2007 | pmid = 17113714 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbagen.2006.09.019 }}</ref><ref name="pmid23486447">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hicks JK, Swen JJ, Thorn CF, Sangkuhl K, Kharasch ED, Ellingrod VL, Skaar TC, Müller DJ, Gaedigk A, Stingl JC | title = Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guideline for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genotypes and dosing of tricyclic antidepressants | journal = Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics | volume = 93 | issue = 5 | pages = 402–8 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23486447 | pmc = 3689226 | doi = 10.1038/clpt.2013.2 }}</ref>

Individuals can be categorized into different types of [[CYP2D6]] metabolizers depending on which genetic variations they carry. These metabolizer types include poor, intermediate, extensive, and ultrarapid metabolizers. Most individuals (about 77–92%) are extensive metabolizers,<ref name="pmid23486447"/> and have "normal" metabolism of nortriptyline. Poor and intermediate metabolizers have reduced metabolism of the drug as compared to extensive metabolizers; patients with these metabolizer types may have an increased probability of experiencing side effects. Ultrarapid metabolizers use nortriptyline much faster than extensive metabolizers; patients with this metabolizer type may have a greater chance of experiencing pharmacological failure.<ref name="pmid 22565785"/><ref name="pmid 17113714"/><ref name="pmid23486447"/>

The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium recommends avoiding nortriptyline in persons who are [[CYP2D6]] ultrarapid or poor metabolizers, due to the risk of a lack of efficacy and side effects, respectively. A reduction in starting dose is recommended for patients who are [[CYP2D6]] intermediate metabolizers. If use of nortriptyline is warranted, therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended to guide dose adjustments.<ref name="pmid23486447"/> The Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group recommends reducing the dose of nortriptyline in [[CYP2D6]] poor or intermediate metabolizers, and selecting an alternative drug or increasing the dose in ultrarapid metabolizers.<ref name="pmid21412232">{{cite journal | vauthors = Swen JJ, Nijenhuis M, de Boer A, Grandia L, Maitland-van der Zee AH, Mulder H, Rongen GA, van Schaik RH, Schalekamp T, Touw DJ, van der Weide J, Wilffert B, Deneer VH, Guchelaar HJ | title = Pharmacogenetics: from bench to byte—an update of guidelines | journal = Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics | volume = 89 | issue = 5 | pages = 662–73 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21412232 | doi = 10.1038/clpt.2011.34 }}</ref>
